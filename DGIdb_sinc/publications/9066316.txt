methods: sixty-three adults gave written informed consent
for this prospective, randomized, double-blind, multiple-cen-
ter trial. anesthesia was induced with thiopental, pancuro-
nium, nitrous oxide/oxygen, and fentanyl (n = 32; 2 ug: kg: |
min -') or  xxxd3094xxx  (n = 31; 1 w-kg ': min '). after tra-
cheal intubation, infusion rates were reduced to 0.03
pe:kg '-min'' (fentanyl) or 0.2 wg-kg ': min ' (remifen-
tanil) and then adjusted to maintain anesthesia and stable he-
modynamics. isoflurane was given only after specified infu-
sion rate increases had occurred. at the time of the first burr
hole, intracranial pressure was measured in a subset of pa-
tients. at bone flap replacement either saline (fentanyl group)
or  xxxd3094xxx  (~0.2 wg:-kg':min-') were infused until
dressing completion. hemodynamics and time to recovery
were monitored for 60 min. analgesic requirements and nau-
sea and vomiting were observed for 24 h. neurological exami-
nations were performed before operation and on postopera-
tive days 1 and 7.

results: induction hemodynamics were similar. systolic
blood pressure was greater in the patients receiving fentanyl
after tracheal intubation (fentanyl = 127 + 18 mmhg; remifen-
tanil = 113 + 18 mmhg; p = 0.004). intracranial pressure
(fentanyl = 14 + 13 mmhg;  xxxd3094xxx  = 13 + 10 mmhg)
and cerebral perfusion pressure (fentanyl = 76 + 19 mmhg;
 xxxd3094xxx  = 78 + 14 mmhg) were similar. isoflurane use
was greater in the patients who received fentanyl. median time
to tracheal extubation was similar (fentanyl = 4 min: range =
—1 to 40 min;  xxxd3094xxx  = 5 min: range = 1 to 15 min). seven
patients receiving fentanyl and none receiving  xxxd3094xxx 
required naloxone. postoperative systolic blood pressure was
greater (fentanyl = 134 + 16 mmhg;  xxxd3094xxx  = 147 + 15
mmhg; p = 0.001) and analgesics were required earlier in
patients receiving  xxxd3094xxx . incidences of nausea and vom-
iting were similar.

conclusion:  xxxd3094xxx  appears to be a reasonable alterna-
tive to fentanyl during elective supratentorial craniotomy.

 xxxd3094xxx  hydrochloride is a p-opioid receptor

min) and a short context-sensitive half-life (4-5 min).?°
the latter property is attributable to hydrolytic metabo-
lism of the compound by nonspecific tissue and plasma
esterases.’ available information indicates that the pri-
mary metabolite has little biologic activity.‘ the phar-
macodynamic characteristics of  xxxd3094xxx  thus may
make this drug appropriate for use during neurosurgical
procedures.

preclinical investigation of the cerebral effects of re-
mifentanil in dogs, which were anesthetized with
isoflurane and nitrous oxide, identified favorable prop-
erties.”  xxxd3094xxx  reduced electroencephalographic
activity, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure
(icp).  xxxd3094xxx  was recently evaluated regarding
icp effects in patients undergoing supratentorial crani-
otomy for space-occupying lesions.° no significant icp
effects were observed when a  xxxd3094xxx  bolus of ei-
ther 0.5 pg/kg or 1 g/kg was administered to patients
anesthesthetized with 0.6% isoflurane in 66% nitrous
oxide (n,o). dose-dependent reduction in cerebral per-
fusion pressure (cpp) with  xxxd3094xxx  was attributed
to reductions in mean arterial pressure.

the primary goal of this study was to compare the
safety and efficacy of  xxxd3094xxx  and fentanyl in pa-
tients requiring craniotomy for supratentorial space-oc-
cupying lesions. a multiple-institution prospective trial
was designed to provide comparative data for the two
opioids on anesthetic induction, maintenance, and
emergence profiles in these patients.

methods

screening procedures

the protocol for this randomized double-blinded
study was approved by the institutional review boards
of duke university medical center, the university of
lowa college of medicine, and columbia university col-
lege of physicians and surgeons. all patients provided
written informed consent. the study was conducted in
63 adults, who weighed no more than 75% above ideal
body weight, were classified as american society of
anesthesiologists physical status 2 or 3, and were sched-
uled for elective excision of a supratentorial space-occu-
pying lesion. patients with clinically relevant preopera-
tive systemic disease or with a known hypersensitivity
to opioids were excluded, as were patients who had
received opioids within 48 h before surgery. patients
with a history of substance abuse were also excluded
female patients were either infertile or had a negative

result of a urine pregnancy test within 24 h before
surgery.

a standard neurologic examination was performed by
a senior neurosurgery resident before operation and on
postoperative days 1 and 7. the neurologic examination
included assessment of mental status, cranial nerve
function, motor and sensory systems, cerebellar func-
tion, and gait.

a cranial computed tomography or magnetic reso-
nance imaging scan was obtained within 6 weeks before
operation. these scans were examined by a senior neu-
rosurgery resident who determined maximum tumor
diameter and magnitude of midline shift. radiographic
mass effect was categorized as none, mild, moderate,
or severe.

each patient had a 12-lead electrocardiogram before
operation and on the first postoperative day. routine
electrocardiogram interpretations by the hospital at-
tending cardiologist were recorded.

preinduction

patients were randomized to receive either remifen-
tanil hydrochloride (25 pg/ml  xxxd3094xxx ; glaxo wellcome,
research triangle park, nc) or fentanyl (50 g/ml subli-
maze; janssen, titusville, nj; or 50 g/ml fentanyl ci-
trate; abbott laboratories, north chicago, il) as contin-
uous intravenous infusions during anesthesia. after en-
rollment, opioid infusion syringes were prepared by the
hospital pharmacy according to randomization sched-
ules. study drug dilutions were performed as appro-
priate to allow administration of the drugs on a milli-
grams-per-kilogram-per-minute basis so that the investi-
gators and staff were blinded to the contents of the
syringes. different syringes were prepared for each
stage of the procedure (induction, maintenance, and
emergence). all investigators were blinded to the opi-
oid assignment until clinical and laboratory assessments
were completed in all patients.

any long-term medications that the patients were tak-
ing were allowed on the day of surgery. no other pre-
medicants except ranitidine (150 mg given orally or 50
mg given intravenously) or midazolam (up to 0.07 mg/
kg given intravenously) were allowed. before anesthesia
was induced, a catheter was inserted into a peripheral
vein and approximately 10 ml/kg lactated  xxxd3213xxx  solu-
tion was infused. standard monitors included a lead ii
electrocardiogram, finger pulse oximeter, and an auto
matic noninvasive blood pressure cuff. a catheter was
placed in the radial artery to continuously monitor
blood pressure, to measure arterial blood gases and ph,

and to collect samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of
 xxxd3094xxx  and its metabolite gr90291 (see below).
a second, contralateral, intravenous catheter was
placed to administer study drug.

preinduction hemodynamic values were recorded.
baseline systolic blood pressure (sbp) was defined as
the mean of the two lowest values recorded at screen-
ing, on the morning of surgery, and immediately before
induction of anesthesia. the term “‘light anesthesia re-
sponses’ was defined as sbp responses more than 15
mmhg above baseline, heart rate responses more than
90 beat/min persisting for more than 1 min, diaphoresis,
or movement. these criteria were used during mainte-
nance anesthesia to justify an increase in the study drug
infusion rate.

induction of anesthesia

pancuronium (up to 2 mg given intravenously) was
administered. anesthesia was induced with thiopental
(4-6 mg/kg given intravenously) followed by pancuro-
nium (0.1 mg/kg). ventilation via mask was begun with
100% oxygen. fentanyl (50 g/ml) or  xxxd3094xxx  (25
g/ml) was administered from the induction infusion
syringe at the rate of 2 ug-kg ‘+ min | (fentanyl) or 1
ug*kg '+min | ( xxxd3094xxx ). this infusion continued
until the investigator determined that an appropriate
level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation was achieved
(target interval, 5 min) or that a maximum infusion
interval of 10 min had elapsed. a supplementary dose
of thiopental (50 - 150 mg) could be given at the time of
intubation. after intubation of the trachea, mechanical
ventilation was begun. an inspired mixture of nitrous
oxide and oxygen (2:1) was administered. ventilation
was adjusted to achieve a predicted partial pressure of
carbon dioxide in arterial blood (paco,) of 28 mmhg.
vital signs were recorded every minute from onset of
study drug infusion until intubation and at 1, 3, and 5
min after intubation.

maintenance

immediately after intubation, the induction infusion
syringe was replaced with a maintenance infusion sy-
ringe. fentanyl (8 ug/ml) or  xxxd3094xxx  (48 ug/ml) was
administered at an initial rate of 0.03 wg-kg '+ min!
(fentanyl) or 0.2 wg-kg ': min ~' ( xxxd3094xxx ).

study drug boluses or infusion rate increases were
used to treat light anesthetic responses as previously
defined. each bolus consisted of 10 ml of either fentanyl
(2 g/kg) or  xxxd3094xxx  (1 wg/kg) given intravenously.

anesthesiology, v 86, no 3, mar 1997

    
  

if three study drug boluses were administered for a
particular response and a fourth bolus was required,
then the fourth bolus had to be followed by an infusion
rate increase. infusion rate increases were made in in-

crements of 0.016 yg:kg ':min | (fentanyl or 0.2 pg
‘kg '+min | ( xxxd3094xxx ). a minimum of 1 min was
required between boluses and at least 2 min between
infusion rate increases. a maximum of five boluses or
a maximum infusion rate of 0.06 yg-kg ': min ' (fen-
 xxxd1733xxx ) or 0.4 pg:-kg '+min ' ( xxxd3094xxx ) was al-
lowed. if the maximum number of boluses, infusion
rate, or both had been administered, then 0.2% isoflur-
ane was added to the inspired inhalational gas mixture.
thereafter, isoflurane could be increased or decreased
in 0.2% increments as needed. throughout surgery,
neuromuscular blockade was maintained, as deemed
appropriate for the surgical procedure, by administer-
ing intermittent boluses of pancuronium.

a sbp less than 80% of baseline, or heart rate less than
45 beats/min persisting for more than 1 min warranted

a decrease in the rate of anesthetic administered. if

isoflurane had been given, it was discontinued before
decreasing the opioid maintenance infusion rate. the
maintenance infusion rate was to be decreased in incre-
ments of 0.016 pg:kg ‘+ min (fentanyl) or 0.2
ug*kg ‘+ min | ( xxxd3094xxx ),

any adverse hemodynamic event that did not respond
to changes in anesthetic regimen could be managed
at any time with ephedrine, phenylephrine, atropine,
 xxxd2435xxx , or esmolol as appropriate.

for pin head-holder placement only, a supplemental
dose of thiopental (50-150 mg) could be given before
the stimulus. hemodynamic values were recorded at
time of pin placement and 5 min afterward.

after the first burr hole was drilled, the physician
ensured that the head was positioned 15° above the
horizontal axis. a gaeltec icp monitor (medical mea-
surements, hackensack, nj) was inserted into the epi-
dural space to measure icp. this measurement was per-
formed at duke university and the university of lowa
only and only in patients without previous craniotomy
(fentanyl n = 16;  xxxd3094xxx  n = 17). for patients at
columbia university, the cerebral blood flow response
to paco, was determined during the same interval, the

results of which will be reported elsewhere when avail-
able. after recording of a stable mean icp value, an
arterial blood sample was collected to measure p.co,-
thereafter mannitol was administered if requested by
the neurosurgeon. when opening the dura, the surgeon

was asked to assess brain volume using a four-point
brain relaxation score (1 = excellent, no swelling; 2 =
minimal swelling, but acceptable; 3 = serious swelling,
no change in treatment required; 4 = severe swelling
requiring intervention).’

emergence and recovery

at bone flap replacement, the opioid maintenance
infusion syringe was replaced with a new unlabeled
infusion syringe provided by the pharmacy to be used
during scalp closure and dressing placement. patients
in the fentanyl group were infused with saline at the
previous maintenance infusion rate for fentanyl. pa-
tients in the  xxxd3094xxx  group continued to receive
 xxxd3094xxx  at the previous maintenance infusion rate.

before the end of surgery,  xxxd2435xxx , hydralazine, or
both could be given as a prophylactic measures against
emergence hypertension. at the end of surgery, residual
neuromuscular block was reversed. once reversal was
adequate, both nitrous oxide and  xxxd3094xxx  or saline
infusions were discontinued and a timer was started.
thereafter, hemodynamic and respiratory responses
were evaluated at i-min intervals for the first 10 min
after discontinuation of nitrous oxide and then at 5-min
intervals for as long as 60 min.

anesthetic recovery was assessed by the investigator
using an established two-part scoring system.’ the first
part of the scoring system assessed level of conscious-
ness, orientation, ability to follow commands, motor
function, and the presence of agitation. the second
used a modified aldrete score.” patients were consid-
ered to have normal scores when alert or arousable to
quiet voice, oriented, able to follow commands, had
motor function unchanged from their preoperative eval-
uation, were not agitated, and had modified aldrete
scores of 9 or 10, these measurements were recorded
until a normal score was obtained or when 60 min had
clapsed after discontinuing nitrous oxide. the investiga-
tor also assessed other acute emergence characteristics,
including time to return of spontaneous respiration and
time to extubation after discontinuation of nitrous ox-
ide, naloxone administration was allowed, at the discre-
tion of the attending anesthesiologist, at any time during
the recovery interval

the quality of emergence was assessed independently
by the neurosurgeon and the investigator, using an iden-
tical questionnaire that assessed patient comfort, hemo-
dynamic profile, level of consciousness, and overall
quality of emergence (defined as better, similar, or
worse than that usually observed for this procedure)

anesthesiology, v 86, no 4, mar 1997

postoperative status after 8 h of recovery was also as-
sessed by the patient’s primary nurse in the intensive
care unit using a similar questionnaire that addressed
level of consciousness and overall quality of recovery
(defined as better, similar, or worse than that usually
observed for this procedure). patient recall of intraoper-
ative events and mental clarity were assessed by the
investigator on the first postoperative day.

all adverse medical events occurring during the study
were recorded, including nausea and vomiting, venous
irritation, and muscular rigidity. phenomena not consid-
ered to be adverse events included incisional pain, head-
ache judged by the investigator to not be more severe
than generally expected, hemodynamic events that re-
sponded to change in study drug or concurrent anesthe-
tic regimen, or prolongation of hospitalization resulting
from an intraoperative change in surgical procedure.

pharmacokinetics

at two institutions, serial arterial whole-blood samples
were collected to determine fentanyl,  xxxd3094xxx , and
gr90291 (the primary  xxxd3094xxx  metabolite) concen-
trations at baseline (7.e., before induction of anesthesia),
every 2 h during maintenance infusion, and 0.5, 1, 2,
1, 8 and 12 h after completion of surgery. fentanyl
whole-blood concentrations were determined by liquid
chromatography -mass spectrometry. gr90291 con-
centrations were determined by gas chromatography.
 xxxd3094xxx  concentrations were determined by either
high-performance liquid chromatographic methods us-
ing ultraviolet detection (for concentrations 1 ng/
ml) or gas chromatography - high-resolution mass spec-
trometry-selected ion monitoring (for concentrations <
1 ng/ml.” all intraoperative steady-state  xxxd3094xxx 
and fentanyl blood concentrations were used to calcu-
late individual clearance values. the terminal elimina-
tion half-life of gr90291 was estimated from the postin-
fusion concentration-time data using log-linear regres-
sion

statistical methods

an a priori power analysis was performed. thirty
patients per treatment group were anticipated to pro-
vide 80% power to detect a clinically significant be-
tween-group difference of 3 min in time to verbal com-
mand recovery at a = 0.05. cox proportional hazard
modeling was used to detect differences and to produce
risk ratio estimates in recovery time analyses. logistic
regression analysis was used to detect differences in
dichotomous response variables. fisher's exact test was

 
 

 

guy et al. |

performed if logistic regression did not converge. analy-
sis of variance was used for normally distributed contin-
uous response variables. a probability value less than
0.05 was considered significant. most parametric values
are reported as means + sd. systolic blood pressure
values are reported as time-weighted means when
stated as such. time-weighted means were calculated
as the area under the curve over the time profile for
each interval divided by the duration of the measure-
ment by assuming the trapezoidal rule. nonparametric
values are reported as medians with ranges. statistical
analysis was performed using sas® system computer
software (sas institute, inc., cary, nc).

results

sixty-three patients were enrolled in the study.
twenty patients were studied at both duke university
and the university of lowa. twenty-three patients were
studied at columbia university. equal numbers of pa-
tients were given fentanyl or  xxxd3094xxx  at each institu-
tion. one patient receiving fentanyl was withdrawn
from the study because surgery was aborted after severe
hemorrhage occurred during removal of the bone flap
and the protocol was abandoned. values for this patient
were included in the analysis through the point of bone
flap removal. this complication was judged by the in-
vestigator to be unlikely to be related to use of the study
drug.

screening procedures

table 1 summarizes patient demographics and tumor
characteristics. there were no important differences
between groups. the most common masses were me-
ningiomas (25%) and gliomas (27%). seventy-five per-
cent of fentanyl-treated patients and 81% of remifen-
tanil-treated patients had been given steroids in the pre-
operative period.

abnormal signs on screening neurologic examination
were found in 49% of patients. cranial nerve and motor
and gait disturbances were the most common abnormal-
ities noted. by chance, the frequency of screening neu-
rologic abnormalities was greater in the  xxxd3094xxx 
group (65%) than in the fentanyl group (40%). no pa-
tient had clinically significant electrocardiogram abnor-
malities before operation.

preinduction and induction

baseline sbp values were similar between treatment
groups, although heart rate was less in the patients

receiving  xxxd3094xxx  (p = 0.034; see figure 1). systolic
blood pressure values were similar between groups
from the start of study drug infusion until the time of
intubation. one patient in the  xxxd3094xxx  group, and
none in the fentanyl group, had a sbp less than 80
mmhg during this interval.

between intubation and 5 min after intubation, sbp
(fentanyl = 127 + 23 mmhg;  xxxd3094xxx  = 113 + 18
mmhg; p = 0.004) and heart rate (p = 0.001) were
greater in patients in the fentanyl group. three patients
in the  xxxd3094xxx  and none in the fentanyl group had
sbp values less than 80 mmhg during this interval. in
contrast, five patients receiving fentanyl and one receiv-
ing  xxxd3094xxx  displayed responses suggesting light
anesthesia at the time of intubation (p = 0.196: see
table 2). the mean total dose of study opioid adminis-
tered during the interval from induction to intubation
was 13 + 3 yug/kg for fentanyl and 7 + 1 pg/kg for
 xxxd3094xxx .

maintenance

most patients in both treatment groups had an infu-
sion rate adjustment or received a bolus dose of opioid.
similar numbers of fentanyl- and  xxxd3094xxx -treated pa-
tients experienced light anesthetic responses (table 2).
despite this, the mean infusion rate of  xxxd3094xxx  re-
mained similar (0.22 yg-kg~'+ min ') to the initial main-
 xxxd3094xxx  for craniotomy

the respective time interval.

tenance rate of 0.20 wge-kg '+min |. by comparison,
the mean infusion rate for fentanyl was increased from
the initial infusion rate of 0.03 pg-kg '+ min | to 0.05
ug:kg ':min ' (66% increase). the last arterial blood
sample taken before discontinuation of the mainte-
nance infusion syringe was considered to best reflect
steady-state blood concentrations of the two opioids.
the concentrations for fentanyl and  xxxd3094xxx  were
3.2 + 2.2 ng/ml and 7.4 + 5.7 ng/ml, respectively. the
median duration of maintenance infusion at this interval
was 4h

the percentage of patients given isoflurane was simi-
lar (fentanyl = 41%,  xxxd3094xxx  = 26%; p

group received more (mean dose in fentanyl patients
= 0.64 minimum alveolar concentration (mac)-hours;
 xxxd3094xxx  patients = 0.07 mac-hours; p = 0.04),
where 1 mac-hour = 1.15% isoflurane given for 1 h.

hypotension (sbp < 80% baseline) or bradycardia
(heart rate < 45 beats/min) for more than 1 min oc-
curred with a similar frequency in both groups, with
hypotension being the most common event. heart rate
was similar during the maintenance period for both
groups (fig. 1).

mean icp and the range of icp values were nearly
identical in the two groups (table 3). five of 16 patients
receiving fentanyl (31%) and 3 of 17 patients receiving
 xxxd3094xxx  had an absolute icp more than 20 mmhg.
mean cpp values were also similar. the pico, values
were similar between groups when icp was measured.
brain relaxation was rated as excellent or acceptable in
most patients. severe brain swelling requiring interven-
tion occurred in three patients given fentanyl (9%) and
no patients given  xxxd3094xxx  (table 3).

emergence and recovery

the median duration of anesthesia was similar be-
tween groups ( xxxd3094xxx  = 298 min; fentanyl = 294
min). the mean total dose of fentanyl was 34 pg/kg
(range, 17-54 pg/kg). the mean total dose of remifen-
tanil was 73 yg/kg (range, 25-149 pg/kg).

table 4 summarizes emergence characteristics. the
median times to emergence were similar between
groups. twice as many fentanyl-treated patients did not
reach a normal recovery score (31% fentanyl, 16% remi-
 xxxd2100xxx ; p = 0.15) within 60 min. seven fentanyl-treated
patients received naloxone during this interval. no re-
mifentanil-treated patients required naloxone (p =

 xxxd2435xxx  (34% fentanyl; 71%  xxxd3094xxx ) or hydralaz-
ine (19% fentanyl; 32%  xxxd3094xxx ).

before discharge from the recovery area, anesthesiolo-
gists and neurosurgeons rated the quality of patient
emergence. ratings by anesthesiologists were not differ-
ent between groups, although there was a trend fa-
voring  xxxd3094xxx  in the overall quality of emergence
(p = 0.08). neurosurgeons rated  xxxd3094xxx -treated
patients as better for patient comfort (p = 0.04), level
of consciousness (p = 0.02), and overall quality of emer-
gence @ = 0.01).

the percentage of patients who required analgesics
for headache within 8 h after the end of surgery was
similar (fentanyl = 50%;  xxxd3094xxx  = 64%; p = 0.22).
however, the median time to first analgesic administra-
tion occurred earlier in the patients in the  xxxd3094xxx 
group (fentanyl = 136 min,  xxxd3094xxx  = 34 min; p
= 0.04). similar numbers of patients experienced nau-

sea and vomiting within 24 h (fentanyl = 57% and 37%;
 xxxd3094xxx  = 50% and 30%). no clinically significant
changes between screening and postoperative electro-
cardiogram were noted in either opioid group.

no differences were found for quality of recovery at
8 h after surgery. mental clarity on the first postopera-
tive day was not different between groups. no remifen-
tanil-treated patients remembered any aspect of the op-
eration. one patient receiving fentanyl reported feeling
the last few stitches.

of the 19 (61%) fentanyl-treated patients who had
normal results of screening neurologic examinations,
five (26%) were abnormal on the first postoperative day
and four (21%) were abnormal on day 7 (table 5). eleven
(35%)  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients had normal results
of screening neurologic examinations. on the first post-
operative day, 2 (18%) of these patients had abnormal
results of these examinations, and by day 7 only one
(9%) continued to have abnormal results. most changes
between screening and postoperative day 1 occurred
in motor testing and cranial nerve function in both treat-
ment groups. between screening and day 7,
changes occurred in motor testing, gait, and cranial
nerve function.

four serious adverse events occurred. three of these
events were considered to be unrelated to study drug.

discussion

important characteristics of an opioid used during
elective supratentorial craniotomy include emergence
and recovery profiles and effects on cpp.”'"'” remifen-
tanil may be useful in neuroanesthesia because of its
ultra-short duration of action’ ''" allowing a more pre-
dictable emergence and recovery. with respect to the
effects of  xxxd3094xxx  on icp and cpp, there is only
limited information for humans. in one study, patients
undergoing elective supratentorial craniotomy were an-
esthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. remifen-
tanil (0.5 wg/kg or | g/kg) was administered as a single
bolus infusion after the first burr hole placement.° intra-
cranial pressure and mean arterial pressure changes
from baseline were determined in the absence of surgi-
cal stimulation. no changes in icp were observed. cere-

anesthesiology, v 86, no 4, mar 1997

bral perfusion pressure was significantly reduced as a
result of the effect of  xxxd3094xxx  on mean arterial pres-
sure and occurred in a dose-dependent manner. effects
of  xxxd3094xxx  on mean arterial pressure and cpp were
comparable to effects observed for alfentanil (10 pg/
kg or 20 pg/kg). the results demonstrated sufficient
similarity between cerebrovascular effects of remifen-
tanil and existing opioids so as to allow execution of a
full-scale trial of  xxxd3094xxx  in a population of patients
having neurosurgery.

in the current trial, we chose to compare a remifen-
tanil-nitrous oxide combination with a fentanyl -ni-
trous oxide combination, each with low-dose isoflurane
rescue. the fentanyl-nitrous oxide regimen is used
commonly for neurosurgical procedures, and extensive
experience with fentanyl exists when studying opioid
effects in patients with supratentorial space-occupying
lesions. "!

before execution of this protocol, we conducted an
open-label pilot study consisting of 30 patients receiv-
ing  xxxd3094xxx  (ten patients at each institution) in
which the full protocol defined in this study was exe-
cuted.'” the induction dose of  xxxd3094xxx  was 1
yug-kg '+min-' followed by 0.4 pg:kg '+min™! ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s recommendations. of the
30 patients, none required isoflurane during the proce-
dure, indicating that the maintenance dose of remifen-
tanil was likely to yield an opioid effect greater than that
seen for fentanyl in previous work using this model.”''
accordingly, the starting  xxxd3094xxx  maintenance infu-
sion rate used in the current study was reduced by one
half (to 0.2 pg-kg '+min~') from that used during the
pilot work.

measurement of blood opioid concentrations indi-
cates that equianalgesic states were derived from the
opioid infusions during the maintenance phase. be-
cause  xxxd3094xxx  is rapidly hydrolyzed, it is more prac-
tical to measure whole-blood concentrations. a remifen-

tanil maintenance concentration of 7.4 ng/ml observed
in our study has been reported to yield a isoflurane
mac value of approximately 0.3%.*’ the mean whole-
blood fentanyl concentration of 3.2 ng/ml observed in
our patients must be converted to plasma concentration
for comparison. using a fentanyl whole-blood:plasma
concentration ratio of 0.965 (e., fentanyl plasma con-
centration of 3.4 ng/ml),*' isoflurane mac would be
predicted to be approximately 0.4%; that is, nearly
identical to that for  xxxd3094xxx . despite this, signifi-
cantly more isoflurane was used for the fentanyl-treated
patients. we speculate that the relatively faster onset
of  xxxd3094xxx  occurring after either bolus or increased
infusion rate resulted in sufficient attenuation of light

anesthesia responses to limit the administration of

isoflurane.

the timing and method of icp measurement in this
study had to be acceptable to anesthesiologists, neuro-
surgeons, and patients. intracranial pressure and cpp
were measured only at the time of first burr hole place-
ment. thus we cannot comment on cerebral hemody-
namic alterations during induction and intubation. ney-
ertheless, we consider our icp measurement to be
representative of steady-state icp values between intu-
bation and dural opening. all icp measurements were
made with an epidural pressure transducer device. al-
though intraventricular and subdural measurements are
believed to be the most accurate methods for icp mea-
surement, measurement with the gaeltec monitor has
compared well in clinical trials.**

minimizing or preventing brain swelling during neuro-
surgical procedures is crucial in providing neurosur-
geons with ideal operating conditions. anesthetic tech-
niques that accentuate brain swelling could make op-
erating conditions more difficult and could contribute
to neurological injury by increasing the requirement for
surgical retraction. intracranial pressure and cpp values
were similar between the  xxxd3094xxx  and fentanyl
treatment groups at the time that the first burr hole
was placed. three patients receiving fentanyl and five
receiving  xxxd3094xxx  had icp values greater than 20
mmhg. however, most patients in both treatment
groups were considered by the neurosurgeon to have
excellent brain relaxation (7.e., no swelling) or minimal
swelling at the time of bone flap removal and dural
opening. no patient receiving  xxxd3094xxx  required in-
tervention for severe brain swelling.

patients appeared more deeply anesthetized with re-
mifentanil compared with fentanyl during the induction
and intubation intervals. in the fentanyl group, heart

anesthesiology, v 86, no 3, mar 1997

rate and sbp were greater and more patients displayed
light anesthetic responses during and immediately after
intubation. in contrast,  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients
were more likely to have reduced sbp (<80 mmhg)
after intubation. the hemodynamics of both treatment
groups were similar during the rest of the study, except
during emergence and early recovery. in the initial re-
covery phase, patients receiving  xxxd3094xxx  had
greater sbp and required antihypertensive drugs to be
given more frequently. this hyperdynamic response
was probably related to inadequate analgesia occurring
in the  xxxd3094xxx  group after discontinuation of the
infusion. this is supported by the absence of measur-
able blood concentrations of  xxxd3094xxx  30 min after
completion of surgery (as opposed to 1.5 + 0.6 ng/
ml for fentanyl).  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients required
analgesic administration much earlier during recovery
than did patients receiving fentanyl. thus analgesic ad-
ministration before emergence, or early in the recovery
interval, may be important in preventing the hyperdy-
namic responses we found in the  xxxd3094xxx -treated
patients.

emergence and recovery from approximately 5 h of

anesthesia were generally rapid in both treatment
groups. of those patients who reached a normal recoy-
ery score in the first 60 min, the median time to normal
recovery was 10 min for both treatment groups. this,
however, does not represent the nine (29%) fentanyl-
treated and five (16%)  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients who
did not achieve normal recovery during that interval.
in contrast, only 10% of the patients in the study by
todd et al.’ who received a fentanyl/nitrous oxide anes-
thetic failed to reach a normal recovery score at 60 min;
in that study, no patients required naloxone. in our
study, seven (23%) of the fentanyl-treated patients re-
quired naloxone for excessive sedation compared with
none of the  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients. the pro-
longed recovery and need for narcotic reversal may be
partially explained by the total fentanyl dose adminis-
tered to patients in our study. patients in the study by
todd et al.” were given a mean total fentanyl dose of
26 pg/kg for procedures with a mean duration of 338
min, compared with 34 pg/kg for procedures lasting a
mean of 294 min in our study.

there did not appear to be a difference in new neuro-
logical changes between treatment groups. however,
we observed a large variance in results of baseline neu-
rological examinations and neurological outcomes 7
days after operation for both treatment groups. a sub-
stantially larger patient population probably would be

required to detect small differences for the two opioids
with respect to neurological outcome should such dif-
ferences exist. side effects were similar, with nausea
and vomiting occurring frequently for both opioids.
one patient treated with  xxxd3094xxx  displayed a brief
but severe episode of emergence delirium. this episode
may have been caused by sudden postoperative inci-
sional pain after rapid elimination of  xxxd3094xxx  from
the blood. in the remaining patients given  xxxd3094xxx ,
postoperative pain was not this severe. however, most
patients receiving  xxxd3094xxx  anesthesia should bene-
fit from prophylactic analgesic administration before
discontinuation of the infusion.

it is unclear why the quality of emergence and recov-
ery from anesthesia was rated differently between anes-
thesiologists and neurosurgeons. neurosurgeons rated
 xxxd3094xxx  patients significantly better than usual in
terms of patient comfort, level of consciousness, and
overall quality of emergence. these differences were
not noted by anesthesiologists. perhaps perceptions of
recovery and emergence in patients having neurosur-
gery were influenced by the observer’s immediate clini-
cal goals.

the purpose of conducting pharmacokinetic investi-
gations in this study was to confirm that the pharmaco-
kinetics of  xxxd3094xxx  and gr90291 are the same after
prolonged administration as that seen previously in
shorter surgical procedures. the clearance of remifen-
tanil and the mean half-life of gr90291 are consistent
with previous studies.*°

in summary, patients undergoing supratentorial crani-
otomy for space-occupying lesions were given either
 xxxd3094xxx  or fentanyl as primary opioids during their
anesthetic care. during anesthesia induction, remifen-
tanil had a rapid onset of effect and effectively attenu-
ated the hemodynamic response to intubation. during
anesthesia maintenance, icp and cpp were similar for
the two opioids. depth of anesthesia during this interval
was easier to manage with  xxxd3094xxx  and allowed a
reduced requirement for isoflurane. the incidence of
naloxone use was less in patients given  xxxd3094xxx . at
the same time, emergence hypertension and surgical
pain were more frequently observed in the  xxxd3094xxx 
group. the frequency of adverse events was similar
between groups.  xxxd3094xxx  appears appropriate for
use during elective supratentorial craniotomy. further
studies are needed to devise techniques that will im-
prove emergence and recovery analgesia in these pa-
tients and allow extension of our findings to other popu-
lations of patients having neurosurgery.
