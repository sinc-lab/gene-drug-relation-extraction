abstract. effects of the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine on plasma glucose levels in mice
were studied. clomipramine at doses ranging 5 – 20 mg / kg elicited significant hyperglycemia
in mice. hyperglycemia elicited by clomipramine was not reduced by pretreatment with the 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) depleter p-chlorophenylalanine. the 5-ht1/ 2 / 5 / 7-receptor antagonist
 xxxd2621xxx  and the 5-ht2a/ 2b/ 2c-receptor antagonist ly 53857 enhanced clomipramineinduced hyperglycemia, while the 5-ht1a/ 1b-receptor antagonist (-)-propranolol and the 5-ht3/ 4receptor antagonist  xxxd3451xxx  did not affect it. the 5-ht2b/ 2c-receptor antagonist sb 206553
facilitated hyperglycemia induced by clomipramine, although the 5-ht2a-receptor antagonist
 xxxd2419xxx  was without effect. clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia was reduced by prior
adrenalectomy. these results suggest that clomipramine induces hyperglycemia in mice by
blocking the 5-ht2b and/ or 5-ht2c receptors, which results in facilitation of adrenaline release.

regulation. the activation of the central 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a,
and 5-ht2b/ 2c receptor elevates plasma glucose levels of
rats (9 – 12). it is well known that stress elevates blood
glucose levels. since depressive patients are considered
sensitive to stress, glucose homeostasis may be affected
more easily than normal subjects. therefore, it is important to clarify the effects of antidepressants on blood
glucose regulation. we previously reported that antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssris) including fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and  xxxd3555xxx , cause hyperglycemia in mice, although mechanisms for hyperglycemia elicited by these ssris may
not be identical (13, 14). nevertheless, clomipramine is
widely used for the therapy of depression. it powerfully
inhibits 5-ht reuptake similar to ssris, but it is not
yet clear whether clomipramine affects plasma glucose
levels. in this study, therefore, we investigated the
effects of clomipramine on plasma glucose levels of
mice.

introduction
a number of observations suggest that enhancement
of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) leads to improvement of
depression (1). clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant like imipramine and is widely used in the therapy
for depression (1, 2). it is recognized that clomipramine
is also available for treatment of obsessive compulsive
disorder (ocd) (2 – 4). in mice, clomipramine reduces
immobility in the forced swimming test, which is the
behavioral model for antidepressants (5, 6). it also
inhibits the ocd animal model, marble burying
behavior in mice (7). antidepressants inhibit reuptake
of noradrenaline and / or 5-ht at nerve terminals and
elevate these amine levels at the synaptic cleft (1, 8).
clomipramine can inhibit reuptake of both noradrenaline and 5-ht, although clomipramine inhibits 5-ht
reuptake more strongly than it inhibits noradrenaline
reuptake (1, 8).
it has been reported that 5-ht is involved in glucose

many antidepressants improve depression by modifying neurotransmission of biogenic amines such as noradrenaline, 5-ht, or dopamine (1, 8). although 5-ht
participates in glucose regulation (9 – 11), effects of
antidepressants on glucose homeostasis are not fully
established. the present results indicate that the tricyclic
antidepressant clomipramine above the dosage of 5 mg
/ kg significantly induced hyperglycemia in mice. previous studies have shown that clomipramine reduces
immobility in the forced swimming test or inhibits
marble burying behavior (5 – 7). the doses at which
clomipramine inhibited behaviors in these models are
higher than those showing hyperglycemia in this study.
it was reported that another tricyclic antidepressant
imipramine induces hyperglycemia in fasted rabbits and
it antagonizes insulin-induced hypoglycemia (15). we
previously reported that ssris fluoxetine or fluvoxamine also elevated plasma glucose levels in non-fasted

78

y sugimoto et al

mice (14). our present results with clomipramine further
shows that the antidepressants may affect glucose
homeostasis.
in previous studies, it was recognized that clomipramine strongly blocks reuptake of 5-ht. the 5-ht
uptake ic50 value of clomipramine was 1.5 nm, which
was lower than that of the ssri, fluvoxamine (3.8 nm)
(8). this suggests that clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia may be related to inhibition of 5-ht reuptake.
thus, we examined the effects of the 5-ht depleter
pcpa on hyperglycemia elicited by clomipramine. the
dose of pcpa used in this study reduced brain 5-ht
levels by 74% and inhibited fluvoxamine-induced
hyeprglycemia in mice (14). however, pcpa did not
affect clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia. therefore,
clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia is not related to
its inhibition of 5-ht reuptake. we previously demonstrated that ssris, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine could
induce hyperglycemia in mice, although these hyperglycemic effects were not equal (14). the 5-ht depleter
pcpa reduces hyperglycemia induced by fluvoxamine,
while hyperglycemic effects of fluoxetine are resistant
to 5-ht depletion (14). these findings suggest that
clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia may be similar to
that induced by fluoxetine.
clomipramine has an affinity for 5-ht2 receptors and
the direct interaction with this receptor may be related to
pharmacological effects of clomipramine (16). thus, to
clarify the involvement of 5-ht-receptor subtypes, we
examined effects of several 5-ht-receptor antagonists
including antagonists of 5-ht2 receptors on clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia. clomipramine-elicited
hyperglycemia was enhanced by the 5-ht1/ 2/ 5/ 7-receptor
antagonist  xxxd2621xxx  and the non-selective 5-ht2receptor antagonist ly 53857. however, the 5-ht1a/ 1breceptor antagonist (-)-propranolol and the 5-ht3/ 4receptor antagonist  xxxd3451xxx  did not affect hyperglycemia induced by clomipramine. these results
suggest that clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia is
related to the  xxxg1113xxx  but not to the 5-ht1a/ 1b
and 5-ht3/ 4 receptors. the present results have shown
that blockade of the  xxxg1113xxx  results in facilitation
of hyperglycemia induced by clomipramine. the involvement of 5-ht2 receptors in the pharmacological
effects of clomipramine has been reported. we previously demonstrated that the 5-ht2-receptor antagonist
ly 53857, at the same dose as used in this study,
enhanced the anti-immobility effects of clomipramine
(6). it indicates that the  xxxg1113xxx  is involved in
the pharmacological effects of clomipramine. thus,
the enhancing effects of ly 53857 on clomipramineinduced hyperglycemia are consistent with results
obtained with the forced swimming test. therefore,

hyperglycemia induced by clomipramine is closely associated with direct effects of clomipramine on the 5-ht2
receptor.
the  xxxg1113xxx  is subdivided into the 5-ht2a,
5-ht2b, and 5-ht2c receptors (17). as shown in the
results, the 5-ht2a-receptor antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  did
not affect clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia. the
5-ht2b/ 2c-receptor antagonist sb 206553 apparently
enhanced hyperglycemia induced by clomipramine.
these results suggest that the selective blockade of
the 5-ht2b/ 2c receptor increases clomipramine-induced
hyperglycemia in mice. it is not known whether clomipramine has affinity with the  xxxg1114xxx . however,
a previous report demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants including imipramine or clomipramine have
an appropriate affinity for the 5-ht2c-receptor subtype
(16). clomipramie may act as a 5-ht2c-receptor antagonist, since it inhibited 5-ht-stimulated phosphoinositide
hydrolysis in the choroid plexus, which is an index of a
5-ht2c-receptor-mediated response (16). therefore, it is
suggested that clomipramine may induce hyperglycemia
in mice as a result of blockade of the  xxxg1115xxx .
it is well known that adrenaline released from the
adrenal gland has an important role in regulating blood
glucose levels and that it elevates plasma glucose levels
by inhibition of insulin release, glycolysis, or inhibition
of glucose uptake in tissues. therefore, we studied
effects of adrenalectomy on clomipramine-hyperglycemia. as shown in the results, adrenalectomy
significantly inhibited clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia. therefore, adrenaline release from the adrenal
gland may be involved in hyperglycemic effects of
clomipramine. as discussed above, the inhibition of
the  xxxg1115xxx  may be related to clomipramineinduced hyperglycemia. recent reports demonstrated
that the  xxxg1115xxx  tonically inhibits noradrenaline
release from the noradrenergic neurons in the brain and
that the blockade of the  xxxg1115xxx  facilitates
noradrenaline release determined by microdialysis (18).
these results indicate that the inhibition of the central
 xxxg1115xxx  by clomipramine may activate the
sympatho-adrenal system, leading to the facilitation of
adrenaline release. it is not yet clear whether clomipramine directly stimulates adrenal medulla and adrenaline release and further studies are required.
in summary, the present results suggest that clomipramine induced an apparent hyperglycemia in mice.
clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia is not associated
with its inhibition of 5-ht reuptake. it is also indicated
that clomipramine-induced hyperglycemia is related to
its inhibition of the 5-ht2b/ 2c receptor, probably the 5ht2c receptor, which is mediated by adrenaline release.
