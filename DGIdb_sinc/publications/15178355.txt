abstract
the present study examined the pharmacology of  xxxd1888xxx , 6-acetyldihydromorphine and dihydroheroin (3,6-diacetyldihydromorphine). like morphine,  xxxd1888xxx  and its acetylated derivatives all were highly selective mu-opioids in receptor binding
assays. all the compounds were potent mu-selective analgesics, as shown by their sensitivity towards the mu-selective opioid receptor
antagonists naloxonazine and h-funaltrexamine. however, the actions of  xxxd1888xxx  and its analogs were readily distinguished from
those of morphine, differences that were surprising in view of the very limited structural differences among them that consisted of only the
reduction of the 7,8-double bond. like heroin and morphine-6h-glucuronide, the analgesic actions of  xxxd1888xxx  and its two acetylated
derivatives were antagonized by 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  at a dose that was inactive against morphine analgesia. antisense mapping also
distinguished between morphine and the  xxxd1888xxx  compounds. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting exon 2 of the cloned
 xxxg1635xxx  gene decreased  xxxd1888xxx  analgesia and that of its acetylated derivatives, but not morphine analgesia. conversely, the exon 1
antisense that effectively lowered morphine analgesia was inactive against  xxxd1888xxx  and its analogs. finally,  xxxd1888xxx  and its
analogs retained their analgesic activity in a mouse model of morphine tolerance, consistent with incomplete cross-tolerance. together, these
findings imply that the mu-opioid receptor mechanisms mediating the analgesic actions of  xxxd1888xxx  and its acetylated analogs are
distinct from morphine and more similar to those of heroin and morphine-6h-glucuronide.

1. introduction
morphine remains the prototypic mu-opioid analgesic.
yet, clinicians have long appreciated a wide range of
responses from their patients for different mu-opioids
(cherny et al., 2001). similarly, animal studies have revealed
pharmacological differences between morphine and other
mu-opioids, particularly morphine-6h-glucuronide (m6g),
heroin and 6-acetylmorphine (rossi et al., 1995, 1996;
pasternak and standifer, 1995; pasternak, 2001). structurally,
all these compounds are very similar to morphine. heroin
( xxxd1865xxx ) is rapidly hydrolyzed to 6-acetylmor* corresponding author. tel.: +1-212-639-7046; fax: +1-212-794-4332.

phine by various esterases and is then more slowly metabolized to morphine (way et al., 1960; elliott et al., 1971). this
rapid de-acetylation suggested that the analgesic activity of
heroin results from 6-acetylmorphine (inturrisi et al., 1983,
1985; umans and inturrisi, 1982). differences in the pharmacological activity of heroin and morphine have been
reported, and these have been largely attributed to differences
in their pharmacokinetics (way et al., 1965). however, heroin
and morphine may work through different receptor mechanisms (lange et al., 1980, 1983; brown et al., 1997; rossi et
al., 1996; schuller et al., 1999; walker et al., 1999; rady et
al., 1991, 1994a). for instance, heroin and its metabolite 6acetylmorphine show limited analgesic cross-tolerance to
morphine (rossi et al., 1996; lange et al., 1980, 1983). in
addition, morphine is inactive when given systemically in
cxbk mice, while heroin and 6-acetylmorphine, like m6g,

124

retain their analgesic activity (rossi et al., 1996). furthermore, the opioid receptor antagonist 3-o- xxxd2614xxx 
selectively reverses the analgesic actions of heroin, 6-acetylmorphine and m6g at doses that are ineffective against
morphine (brown et al., 1997). antisense mapping studies
based upon the cloned mu-opioid receptor  xxxg1635xxx  (mop)
also distinguish among these agonists (rossi et al., 1995,
1996), as does a knockout mouse that has lost all analgesic
sensitivity to morphine, but not to m6g, heroin and 6acetylmorphine due to a disruption of exon 1 of the  xxxg1635xxx 
gene that encodes the cloned mu-opioid receptor  xxxg1635xxx 
(mop) (schuller et al., 1999). even transduction systems
seem to differ among them, as shown by their different
sensitivity profiles to antisense treatments against various
g-proteins (standifer et al., 1996).
these differences between morphine and heroin are hard
to explain by a single mu-opioid receptor, supporting the
concept of multiple mu-opioid receptors as first proposed
from traditional pharmacological approaches (pasternak and
snyder, 1975a; pasternak and hahn, 1980; wolozin and
pasternak, 1981; hahn et al., 1982; spiegel et al., 1982;
gintzler and pasternak, 1983; ling and pasternak, 1983;
goodman and pasternak, 1984; ling et al., 1984, 1985) and
more recently by the identification of multiple splice variants of the cloned mu-opioid receptor  xxxg1635xxx  (mop-1)
(zimprich et al., 1995; bare et al., 1994; pan et al., 1999,
2000, 2001).
 xxxd1888xxx  differs structurally from morphine
only by the reduction of the 7,8-double bond (fig. 1).
this reduction changes the c-ring from a boat to a chair
conformation, but has few other structural effects. binding assays have confirmed its high selectivity for muopioid receptors, and it has long been considered pharmacologically equivalent to morphine, although slightly
more potent (wolozin and pasternak, 1981; clark et al.,
1988; pasternak et al., 1975a; pasternak and snyder,

1975a). in the current study, we have compared the
pharmacology of  xxxd1888xxx  and its acetylated
derivatives to morphine.

2. materials and methods
all radioligands were purchased from dupont nen
(boston, ma), except for [3h]naloxone benzoylhydrazone,
which was synthesized in our lab as previously described
(price et al., 1989). naloxonazine was synthesized as
previously reported (hahn et al., 1982). morphine sulphate,  xxxd1888xxx , naltrexone, heroin, 6-acetylmorphine, h-funaltrexamine and 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  were
obtained from the research technology branch of the
national institute of drug abuse (rockville, md). naltrindole and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-bni) were purchased
from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa). 3,6-diacetyldihydromorphine and 6-acetyldihydromorphine were synthesized
and their structures were confirmed by standard chemical
procedures (hosztafi and pasternak, in preparation). halothane was purchased from halocarbon laboratory (hackensack, nj, usa).
all in vivo studies were carried out in accordance with
the declaration of helsinki and with the guide for care
and use of laboratory animals, as adopted and promulgated by the national institutes of health. male crl:cd-1r
(icr) br mice (20 –25 g) were purchased from charles
river laboratories (raleigh, nc). mice were housed in a
12-h light/dark cycle temperature-controlled room with
food and water freely available. intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) and intrathecal (i.t.) injections were given under
light halothane anesthesia as previously reported (rossi et
al., 1995; haley and mccormick, 1957; hylden and
wilcox, 1980).
2.1. radiant heat tail-flick assay

fig. 1. structures of  xxxd1888xxx  and its acetylated derivatives.

antinociception, referred to as ‘‘analgesia,’’ was
assessed in the radiant heat tail-flick test as previously
described (d’amour and smith, 1941; paul and pasternak,
1988; paul et al., 1989). baseline latencies typically ranged
between 2 and 3 s. analgesia was defined quantally as the
doubling or greater of the baseline latency for each mouse
(paul and pasternak, 1988; paul et al., 1989; rossi et al.,
1996). the use of quantal analysis goes back to the original
studies of d’amour and smith (d’amour and smith, 1941;
le bars et al., 2001). results analyzed quantally corresponded closely to those analyzed using graded responses
(data not shown). drugs were tested at peak analgesic effect
after the time course for each drug was established. after
systemic administration, the peak effect for all drugs was 30
min, except for 3,6-diacetyldihydromorphine and 6-acetyldihydromorphine for which the peak effect was 45 min after
injection. central injections (i.c.v. and i.t.) were assessed 15
min after injection.

2.2. antisense mapping
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting exons 1 and 2
of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene were purchased from midland certified
reagent co. (midland, tx) and purified in our lab as
previously described (rossi et al., 1995). antisense sequences were based on mouse  xxxg1635xxx  gene sequence (genbank
accession # u26915) (rossi et al., 1995). the antisense
sequence for exon 1 was 5v-cgc ccc agc ctc ttc
ctc t-3v and the mismatch sequence for exon 1 was 5vcgc ccc gac ctc ttc cct t-3v. the  xxxg1635xxx  exon 2
antisense sequence was 5v-ttg  xxxg889xxx  gca gtc ttc att
ttg g-3v and the mismatch sequence for exon 2 was 5vtgt  xxxg889xxx  gca gtc ttc att tgt g-3v. antisense
studies were performed as previously reported (rossi et al.,
1995). mice were injected i.c.v. (5 ag in 2 al of 0.9% sterile
saline) on days 1, 3 and 5 and analgesia was assessed on
day 6.
2.3. gastrointestinal transit
the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit was measured as
previously described (paul and pasternak, 1988). in brief,
mice that were food-deprived for 18– 24 h received either
saline or one of the test drugs and given a standard charcoal
meal (0.5 ml) by gavage. they were sacrificed 30 min after
the charcoal meal and the distance traveled by the charcoal
meal was determined.
2.4. tolerance
groups of mice (n z 20) received either saline or morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) for five consecutive days. on the sixth
day, mice received equianalgesic doses of either morphine
(5 mg/kg, s.c.), dihydroheroin (5 mg/kg, s.c.) or 6-acetyldihydromorphine (6-acdhm; 5.5 mg/kg, s.c.).

2.6. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions
(rt-pcr)
rt-pcr was performed as previously described (pan et
al., 1999). in brief, rna was extracted from mouse striatum
by the acid guanidium thioacyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method as previously described (chomczynski and
sacchi, 1987). one microgram of rna was converted to
cdna with superscript ii reverse transcriptase (gibco)
in the presence of random primers for a total volume of 22
al. the pcr reaction was performed in a final volume of 50
al containing 3 al of the cdna and carried out in a thermal
cycler (geneamp pcr system 9600, perkin elmer, norwalk, ct) for 35 cycles. the primers spanned over exons 1
and 2 of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene: primer sense (5v-gagaggaagaggctggggcgc-3v) and primer antisense (5vccggtcaaggccctggatttccg-3v). loading was
verified by parallel amplification of the mouse housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(g3pdh) with 5v-tgaaggtcggtgtgaacggatttggc-3v as sense primer and 5v-catgtaggccatgaggtccaccac-3v as antisense primer (clontech
laboratories, palo alto, ca, usa). the pcr products
were allowed to migrate on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide and visualized under uv transillumination (bio-rad gel doc, 2000, hercules, ca, usa).
2.7. statistical analyses
ed50 values and 95% confidence intervals were determined using the litchfield –wilcoxon method (litchfield
and wilcoxon, 1949; tallarida and murray, 1987). direct
comparison of quantal results utilized the fisher’s exact test.
for the gastrointestinal transit study, group differences were
determined by a one-way analysis of variance followed by a
dunnett’s post hoc test.

2.5. receptor binding assays
3. results
calf brain and guinea pig cerebellar membranes were
prepared and binding assays were performed as previously
reported (clark et al., 1988, 1989). in brief, mu1 binding
was determined using [ 3 h][ d -ala 2 , d -leu 5 ]enkephalin
(dadl) in calf thalamus in the presence of unlabeled [dpen2,d-pen5]enkephalin (dpdpe) to compete delta opioid
receptor binding, while mu2 opioid binding was assessed
using [3h][d-ala2,mephe4,gly(ol)5]enkephalin (damgo)
in the presence of unlabeled [d-ser2, xxxg2329xxx ]enkephalin-thr6
(dslet) to compete mu1 opioid binding. delta binding was
determined in calf frontal cortex using [3h]dpdpe. kappa1
binding was determined in guinea pig cerebellum with
[3h]u69,593 and kappa3 sites were assessed with [3h]naloxone benzoylhydrazone in calf striatum in the presence of
edta. in competition studies, ic50 values were obtained
using graph prism (san diego, ca) and ki values were
determined (cheng and prusoff, 1973; chou, 1974).

 xxxd1888xxx  is a potent mu-opioid that is structurally similar to morphine (fig. 1). in binding studies,
 xxxd1888xxx  showed high affinity and selectivity for
mu-opioid binding sites (table 1). it competed mu-opioid
receptor binding slightly more potently than morphine and
was far less active against delta and kappa1 binding sites.
acetylation of the 6-position to yield 6-acetyldihydromorphine lowered its affinity for mu receptors approximately 5fold to 10-fold while enhancing its potency for delta binding
sites, although it was still over 100-fold more selective for
mu-opioid binding. dihydroheroin showed lower affinity
for all the binding sites, perhaps reflecting the importance of
the free 3-hydroxyl group in maintaining opioid receptor
binding affinity.
all the derivatives were potent analgesics (table 2).

ki values were determined from competition studies, as described in
materials and methods. each value represents the mean f s.e.m. of at least
three independent experiments, each of which was performed in triplicate.
the values for morphine are taken from the literature (clark et al., 1989).

phine were significantly more potent than all the other
derivatives, including morphine. however, heroin was
less potent than morphine supraspinally. dihydroheroin,
on the other hand, was equipotent to morphine systemically and supraspinally.  xxxd1888xxx  and 6-acetyldihydromorphine were equipotent to morphine both
systemically and supraspinally. spinally, the relative potencies of the drugs were somewhat different, with heroin
showing a significantly greater potency spinally than
supraspinally ( p < 0.05). all the other drugs tested
showed a decreased potency following spinal administration, although the difference was significant ( p < 0.05)
only for  xxxd1888xxx  and dihydroheroin.
all the drugs were mu-opioid analgesics (fig. 2). naltrexone, a general opioid receptor antagonist, reversed the
actions of all the analgesics, as did the mu-selective opioid
receptor antagonists h-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine
(fig. 2). as expected, neither the kappa1-selective opioid
receptor antagonist norbni nor the delta-selective opioid
receptor antagonist naltrindole effectively blocked any of
the agents, confirming their mu selectivity.

analogs. groups of mice (n z 20) received equianalgesic doses of morphine
(5 mg/kg, s.c.), dihydroheroin (5 mg/kg, s.c.) or 6-acetyldihydromorphine
(6-acdhm; 5.5 mg/kg, s.c.). immediately prior to the administration of
naltrexone (1 mg/kg, s.c.), 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  (3-o-mentx, 0.25 mg/
kg, s.c.), norbni (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or naltrindole (20 mg/kg, s.c.). the muselective antagonists h-funaltrexamine (40 mg/kg, s.c.) and naloxonazine
(35 mg/kg, s.c.) were administered 24 h before testing. asterisks indicate
decreased analgesia compared to control for the corresponding agonist

lite 6-acetylmorphine at doses that are inactive against
morphine (brown et al., 1997; walker et al., 1999). in the
current studies, 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  again was inactive
against morphine, but it reversed both 6-acetyldihydromorphine and dihydroheroin analgesia. thus, all the acetylated
derivatives were sensitive to 3-o- xxxd2614xxx . however, 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  also blocked  xxxd1888xxx 
analgesia, clearly distinguishing its pharmacological profile
from that of morphine.
cross-tolerance is a powerful tool capable of distinguishing subtle differences in the mechanisms of action of
opioids. we looked for cross-tolerance to morphine using
a daily-dosing paradigm over 5 days that produces approximately a 2-fold shift of the morphine dose –response curve
(kolesnikov et al., 1993). in this paradigm, morphine’s
response decreased over 5 days from 70% to only 10%
(fig. 3). however, equianalgesic doses of 6-acetyldihydromorphine and dihydroheroin retained their analgesic activity
in the morphine tolerant mice, implying the lack of complete
cross-tolerance.

finally, opioids have long been known to inhibit gastrointestinal transit. in the current study, morphine inhibited
gastrointestinal motility, lowering transit from approximately 30 to under 10 cm (fig. 6). the other compounds given at
equianalgesic doses also lowered transit to a similar extent.

4. discussion

fig. 3. cross-tolerance of 3,6-diacetyldihydromorphine and 6-acetyldihydromorphine with morphine. groups of mice (n z 20) received either saline
or morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) for five consecutive days. on the sixth day,
mice received an equianalgesic dose of either morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.),
dihydroheroin (5 mg/kg, s.c.) or 6-acetyldihydromorphine (6-acdhm; 5.5
mg/kg, s.c.). the asterisk indicates a significant decrease in analgesic
response compared to control mice treated with saline for 5 days and
morphine on testing day ( p < 0.05).

antisense mapping of the various exons of  xxxg1635xxx  has
revealed differences among various mu-opioid drugs (pasternak and standifer, 1995; rossi et al., 1995, 1996). we
therefore examined the effects of antisense probes targeting
exons 1 or 2 of  xxxg1635xxx  on the analgesic actions of the
agents. first, we confirmed the efficacy of the antisense
approach using rt-pcr using an upstream exon 1 primer
and a downstream exon 2 primer. each antisense probe
effectively and selectivity down-regulated mrna expression (fig. 4). the primers used in this study will only
measure mrna transcripts that contain both exons 1 and 2.
however, the exon 2 antisense would still be expected to
down-regulate only transcripts that contain exon 2 and vice
versa. splice variants lacking either exon 1 or exon 2 have
been cloned (pan et al., 1999, 2001; du et al., 1997). the
inactivity of the mismatch primers confirms the specificity
of the down-regulation.
we then examined the behavioral effects of the antisense
treatments. mismatch antisense probes, in which the sequence of four of the bases were scrambled, were ineffective, ensuring the specificity of the paradigm. the exon 1
antisense probe decreased the analgesic actions of morphine
(fig. 5), as previously reported (rossi et al., 1995, 1996,
1997), but not the analgesia induced by any of the other
compounds. in contrast, the exon 2 antisense probe significantly lowered the responses of  xxxd1888xxx  and both
of its acetylated derivatives, but not morphine. thus, the
selectivity profile of  xxxd1888xxx  and its acetylated
derivatives in antisense mapping studies also differentiated
them from morphine.

 xxxd1888xxx  is a potent mu-selective opioid analog
of morphine that has long been used in receptor binding
studies (pasternak et al., 1975a,b; pasternak and snyder,
1975b; pert et al., 1973; wilson et al., 1975). likewise, its
acetylated derivatives also were mu-selective, although their
actual affinities were lower than  xxxd1888xxx . they all
showed poor affinity for delta opioid receptors and their
ability to compete kappa opioid binding remained at least
20-fold poorer than mu binding.
 xxxd1888xxx  was an effective analgesic, with a
potency similar to that of morphine. as previously reported
(umans and inturrisi, 1981; inturrisi et al., 1983), heroin
and 6-acetylmorphine were far more potent than morphine
after systemic administration in the current studies, but the
acetylated derivatives of  xxxd1888xxx  were no more
effective than morphine or  xxxd1888xxx  itself. it has
been suggested that the enhanced potency of systemic
heroin compared to morphine was due to its greater lipophilicity and penetration of the blood – brain barrier. however, if this were the case, we would have expected a similar
enhanced activity of dihydroheroin and 6-acetyldihydromorphine compared to  xxxd1888xxx . since the lipophilicity
of morphine and  xxxd1888xxx  is very similar (kutter et
al., 1970), the lipophilicity differences between their acetylated derivatives also should be quite minimal. yet, dihy-

by rt-pcr, as described in materials and methods. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting exon 1 and exon 2 of the  xxxg1635xxx  gene decreased
mrna levels compared to mismatch probes or saline. as predicted, the size
of the amplified cdna fragments were 568 bp. loading was verified by
pcr of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (g3pdh) which gave
the expected 982 bp fragments with similar intensity in all lanes.

fig. 5. effects of antisense treatments on opioid analgesia. groups of mice (n z 20) were treated supraspinally with saline or one of the four antisense probes on
days 1, 3 and 5 and tested with either  xxxd1888xxx  (6 mg/kg, s.c.), dihydroheroin (5 mg/kg, s.c.), 6-acetyldihydromorphine (6-acdhm; 5.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or
morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) on day 6. asterisks indicate a decreased analgesic effect compared to saline-treated mice that received the corresponding agonist on
testing day ( p < 0.05).

droheroin did not demonstrate the enhanced potency seen
with heroin following systemic administration. thus, it
seems that lipophilicity alone cannot explain the enhanced
potency of systemic heroin compared to morphine.
all the derivatives were mu-opioid-selective in the
analgesic assays, as demonstrated by their sensitivity towards h-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine. however, the
pharmacological profile of  xxxd1888xxx  and its acetylated derivatives differed from morphine in several aspects.
previously, we demonstrated that 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  at
doses that are ineffective against morphine selectively
blocks the analgesic actions of heroin and 6-acetylmorphine
(brown et al., 1997; walker et al., 1999). the current
studies revealed a similar blockade of 6-acetyldihydromorphine and dihydroheroin at an antagonist dose inactive
against morphine. however, 3-o- xxxd2614xxx  also
antagonized the actions of  xxxd1888xxx . this difference between  xxxd1888xxx  and morphine was quite
unexpected since they differ structurally only by the reduction of the 7,8-double bond. this suggests that subtle
structural differences, such as changing the conformation
of the c-ring from the ‘‘boat’’ conformation in morphine to
the ‘‘chair’’ conformation in  xxxd1888xxx , can impact
on the pharmacology of the drug.
antisense mapping studies also distinguished  xxxd1888xxx  and its derivatives from morphine. prior work
from our group reported that morphine was sensitive to
antisense probes targeting exon 1, but not exon 2 (rossi et
al., 1995). in contrast, heroin analgesia was sensitive to both
exon 1 and exon 2 antisense probes (rossi et al., 1996).
 xxxd1888xxx  and dihydroheroin were different, with
their analgesic actions lowered only by the exon 2 antisense
probe, a sensitivity similar to that of morphine-6h-glucuronide (rossi et al., 1995). thus, antisense mapping also
illustrated pharmacological differences between morphine

and  xxxd1888xxx , further supporting the importance of
the c-ring conformation in defining the pharmacology of
the drug.
in the present study, dihydroheroin and 6-acetyldihydromorphine do not show cross-tolerance to morphine. this
probably reflects the limited level of morphine tolerance in
the current model. it is likely that in animals showing a far
greater tolerance, morphine would show partial cross-tolerance to dihydroheroin and 6-acetyldihydromorphine. lack
of cross-tolerance between heroin and morphine has been

groups of mice (n z 10) received either morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.), heroin
(0.9 mg/kg, s.c.), 6-acetylmorphine (6-acmorphine; 1 mg/kg, s.c.),
 xxxd1888xxx  (dhm; 6 mg/kg, s.c.), dihydroheroin (5 mg/kg, s.c.) or
6-acetyldihydromorphine (6-acdhm; 5.5 mg/kg, s.c.), followed by the
charcoal meal and gastrointestinal transit determined. results are the
means f s.e.m. the groups treated with opioids were significantly
different from the saline control, as determined by anova ( p < 0.001).

reported previously, and it was proposed that heroin might
be acting through delta receptors in morphine tolerant mice,
in part due to the activity of naltrindole (lange et al., 1980;
rady et al., 1991, 1994b, 1998; holmes et al., 1998; ).
although the change in antagonist sensitivity of heroin in
morphine tolerant animals is interesting and deserves further study, it cannot account for many of the pharmacological differences between heroin and morphine seen in naive
mice (rossi et al., 1996; schuller et al., 1999) and the
differences in the current studies with  xxxd1888xxx  and
its analogs. these differences imply the possibility of a
distinct receptor mechanism(s) of action, although all compounds act through mu-opioid receptors. the idea that
different receptors mediate the analgesic effect of muopioids is further supported by the observation that both
drug abusers and animals easily distinguish morphine from
heroin (martin and fraser, 1961). the differences between
 xxxd1888xxx  itself and morphine suggest that even
subtle structural differences induced by reduction of the
7,8-double bond can change the selectivity of the ligand.
the possibility of multiple mu-opioid receptors is more
interesting in view of the recent cloning of a large number
of mu-opioid receptor splice variants (zimprich et al., 1995;
bare et al., 1994; pan et al., 1999, 2000, 2001). while none
have yet been associated with the actions of specific mu
ligands, their presence indicates that this possibility must be
considered and explored further.
