a number of epidemiological studies. this finding has generated much interest in elucidating hdl structure, function, and
metabolism. to date, the structural heterogeneity of hdl is
well established especially in terms of size distribution. this
heterogeneity may be of physiopathological relevance with
hdl size distribution being more strongly related with the
presence of coronary heart disease than absolute hdl levels
(1). several factors have been reported to influence hdl particles such as lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase ( xxxg1305xxx ) (2),
 xxxg1329xxx  (hl) (3),  xxxg432xxx  (4),
and  xxxg1782xxx  ( xxxg1782xxx ) (5).
interestingly,  xxxg1782xxx  by facilitating surface phospholipid
transfer between lipoproteins (6) favors the continuous remodeling of hdl in the blood stream. as shown by in vivo and in
vitro studies,  xxxg1782xxx  can modulate the levels, the size, and the
composition of hdl (7–9), and incubation of hdl with  xxxg1782xxx 
induced the emergence of both large ␣hdl and small pre␤hdl (10). in support of the physiological relevance of the
latter observations, increases in ␣hdl and pre-␤hdl were
observed in human  xxxg1782xxx  and apoai transgenic mice (11).
fibrates constitute a class of frequently used normolipidemic
drugs that efficiently decrease triglycerides and increase hdl
plasma levels in humans (12, 13). they exert their effect, at
least in part, through alterations in transcription of genes
encoding for proteins that control lipoprotein metabolism (14).
indeed, fibrates activate specific transcription factors termed
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars), a subfamily of the nuclear receptors (15). particularly, the ppar␣
form mediates fibrate action on hdl cholesterol levels via
transcriptional induction of the synthesis of the major hdl
apolipoproteins, i.e. apoai and  xxxg174xxx  (16, 17).
in human apoai transgenic (huaitg) mice, treatment with
 xxxd2096xxx  led to large increases in human apoai and hdl
cholesterol and large qualitative modifications of hdl with the
appearance of large and cholesteryl ester-enriched ␣hdl (16).
the mechanisms of the structural modification of hdl in huaitg mice treated with  xxxd2096xxx  are, however, not yet understood. because hdl structure and metabolism partly depend
on a few plasma enzyme and lipid transfer activities, we assumed that  xxxd2096xxx  may modulate these activities, which
would account for the changes in hdl structure. the goals of
the present study were to evaluate the effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on
the expression and activity of  xxxg1782xxx ,  xxxg1305xxx , and hl. in a
second part of the study, the relative contribution of  xxxg1782xxx  to
the  xxxd2096xxx -mediated alterations in hdl size distribution
was specifically addressed in  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice. finally, be-

fibrate treatment in mice is known to modulate high
density lipoprotein (hdl) metabolism by regulating apolipoprotein (apo)ai and  xxxg174xxx  gene expression. in addition to alterations in plasma hdl levels, fibrates induce
the emergence of large, cholesteryl ester-rich hdl in
treated transgenic mice expressing human apoai (huaitg). the mechanisms of these changes may not be restricted to the modulation of apolipoprotein gene expression, and the aim of the present study was to determine
whether the expression of factors known to affect hdl
metabolism (i.e.  xxxg1782xxx  ( xxxg1782xxx ),
lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and  xxxg1329xxx )
are modified in  xxxd2096xxx -treated mice. significant rises
in plasma  xxxg1782xxx  activity were observed after 2 weeks of
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment in both wild-type and huaitg mice.
simultaneously, hepatic  xxxg1782xxx  mrna levels increased in
a dose-dependent fashion. in contrast to  xxxg1782xxx , lecithin:
cholesterol acyltransferase mrna levels in huaitg mice
were not significantly modified by  xxxd2096xxx  despite a
significant decrease in plasma cholesterol esterification
activity.  xxxd2096xxx  did not induce any change in hepatic
lipase activity.  xxxd2096xxx  significantly increased hdl
size, an effect that was more pronounced in huaitg mice
than in wild-type mice. this effect in wild-type mice was
completely abolished in  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice. finally,  xxxd2096xxx  treatment did not influence  xxxg1782xxx  activity or
hepatic mrna in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-␣-deficient mice. it is concluded that 1)  xxxd2096xxx 
treatment increases plasma phospholipid transfer activity as the result of up-regulation of  xxxg1782xxx  gene expression
through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-␣dependent mechanism, and 2) increased plasma  xxxg1782xxx 
levels account for the marked enlargement of hdl in
 xxxd2096xxx -treated mice.

 xxxd2096xxx  induces  xxxg1782xxx  gene expression in mouse
plasma lipid and lipoprotein analysis
blood was taken from the retroorbital plexus of the mice after a 2-h
fast. plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min.
lipoproteins were purified by sequential ultracentrifugation using a tl
100.4 rotor with a tabletop tl 100 centrifuge (beckman instruments).
hdl was purified between the densities 1.063 and 1.210 g/ml in all
animals with the exception of hdl from huaitg mice treated with the
higher dose of  xxxd2096xxx  (0.2%), which was purified between 1.019 and
1.210 g/ml because analysis of lipoproteins by density gradient ultracentrifugation showed that apoai-containing lipoproteins fell within
these density limits (data not shown).
lipoprotein size was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis (4 –
20% polyacrylamide gels, novex gel, invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca)
under nonreducing conditions. the migration was carried out for 12 h,
and the gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue r250 and
destained with a solution of methanol/acetic acid/water (30:58:12, v/v/
v). the gels were then scanned with a densitometer (gs-300 scanning
densitometer, hoefer scientific instruments, san francisco, ca). the
size of lipoproteins was determined from a curve built from standards of
known size (high molecular weight standards, amersham pharmacia
biotech) that were migrated simultaneously.

enzymatic assays of  xxxg1782xxx ,  xxxg1305xxx , and hl activities

cause ppar␣ has been shown to mediate the effects of  xxxd2096xxx  on several genes, we sought to test the hypothesis that
ppar␣ is involved in the observed changes using ppar␣deficient mice.
materials and methods

animals
mice used in this study were nontransgenic c57bl/6 mice, heterozygous huaitg mice,  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice ( xxxg1782xxx ⫺/⫺) and their wild-type
controls ( xxxg1782xxx ⫹/⫹), and homozygous ppar␣-deficient mice
(ppar␣⫺/⫺) and their wild-type controls (ppar␣⫹/⫹). huaitg mice
contained 21 copies of an 11-kilobase pair human apoai genomic dna
fragment and the liver-specific enhancer of the human apoai gene
promoter necessary to drive hepatic apoai expression (18).  xxxg1782xxx ⫺/⫺
were obtained by deletion of part of the  xxxg1782xxx  gene containing exon 2.
because this exon contains the translation initiation codon and the
signal peptide, mice were null  xxxg1782xxx  animals (19). ppar␣⫺/⫺ mice
were obtained by disrupting the ligand-binding domain of the ppar␣
by homologous recombination (20, 21). 10 –12-week-old mice were caged
in an animal room with alternating 12-h light (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and
dark (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) cycles and were fed either the control or  xxxd2096xxx  (sigma) diet ad libitum for 2 weeks.  xxxd2096xxx  was mixed in
mouse chow at 0.02 and 0.2% (w/diet w), two dosages commonly used in
mice (16). body weight and food intake of the mice were regularly
checked during the treatment period. no toxic side effect of  xxxd2096xxx 
treatment as checked by alterations in body weight was observed.

rna analysis
total cellular rna was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (25). northern blot hybridizations were
performed as previously described (26) using the cdna fragments of
 xxxg1305xxx  (27) and  xxxg1782xxx  and 28 s rrna as probes.  xxxg1782xxx  cdna was
amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the
following primers: 5⬘-tcg  xxxg873xxx  gag ggt  xxxg889xxx  tcc at-3⬘ and 5⬘-cat

fig. 1. size distribution of hdl in huaitg mice before and
after treatment with  xxxd2096xxx . animals were treated for 15 days
with  xxxd2096xxx  (0.02 and 0.2%), and plasma was collected. lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and separated by
polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (4 –20%). gels were stained
with coomassie brilliant blue r-250. profiles were obtained with a
densitometer (gs-300 scanning densitometer), and the migration distance of each absorption maximum (corresponding to a stained band)
was determined. the molecular diameter corresponding to each of the
peaks was calculated from a calibration curve using standards of known
diameters. au, absorbance units; ff,  xxxd2096xxx .

plasma  xxxg1782xxx  activity— xxxg1782xxx  activity was measured in total plasma
as the transfer of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine from [14c]phosphatidylcholine liposomes to an excess of exogenous human hdl3 (22).
briefly, 10 ␮mol of [14c]l-␣-phosphatidylcholine (perkinelmer life sciences) and 0.1 ␮mol of  xxxd398xxx  were mixed, and the
lipids were dried under nitrogen, suspended in 1 ml of 150 mm nacl, 10
mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta (ph 7.4), sonicated, and centrifuged to
remove lipid aggregates and metallic debris. plasma samples were
incubated for 1 h at 37 °c with radiolabeled liposomes (50 nmol of
phospholipid) and isolated human hdl3 (250 ␮g of protein) in a final
volume of 400 ␮l with 150 mm nacl, 10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta (ph
7.4). at the end of the incubation, liposomes were precipitated with
 xxxd1860xxx . the supernatant (0.5 ml) was used for radioactivity
determinations. plasma volumes were chosen to keep  xxxg1782xxx  activity in
the linear range of the assay.  xxxg1782xxx  activity was expressed as micromoles of phosphatidylcholine transferred from liposomes to exogenous
human hdl3 per milliliter of plasma.
 xxxg1305xxx  activity— xxxg1305xxx  activity was determined using an exogenous
substrate according to the method described by chen and albers (23).
mouse plasma (50 ␮l) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °c with a proteoliposome substrate containing apoai, [14c]cholesterol, and 1- xxxd2832xxx -2oleoyl-sn-glycero-3- xxxd2929xxx . after incubation, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by thin-layer
chromatography on silica gel plates using a solvent system composed of
petroleum ether/ xxxd2052xxx /acetic acid (90:10:5, v/v/v). cholesteryl
ester and free cholesterol radioactivity were measured on a phosphorimager.  xxxg1305xxx  activity was expressed as the percentage of free cholesterol esterified during incubation.
 xxxg1329xxx  activity—hl activity was measured according to the
method described by henderson et al. (24) in postheparin plasma.
postheparin plasma was obtained 5 min after an intravenous bolus
injection of 60 iu of sodium heparin/kg of body weight. blood was
immediately centrifuged at 4 °c and frozen at ⫺80 °c until assay.
the assay mixture for hl was prepared with 5 ␮ci of tri-[1-14c]oleoylglycerol, 5.68 ml of 90 g/liter arabic gum in 0.2 m tris-hcl, ph 8.5,
100 mg of unlabeled triolein, and 2.75 ml of 200 g/liter bovine serum
albumin. after sonication, 2.58 ml of 3.24 m nacl in 0.2 m  xxxd3449xxx ,
ph 8.5, was added to the mixture. triglyceride hydrolysis was started
by adding postheparin plasma and allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °c.
triglyceride hydrolysis was stopped by adding 3.25 ml of chloroform/
methanol/heptane (50:56:40, v/v/v) and 1 ml of 0.1 m carbonate borate
buffer, ph 10.5. reaction tubes were shaken for 5 min and centrifuged.
a 0.5-ml aliquot of the upper phase was removed and counted in a
scintillation counter. after correction for recovery, results were expressed in micromoles of  xxxd2154xxx  liberated per milliliter of plasma
per hour.

results

effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on hdl size distribution in huaitg
mice—as expected (16),  xxxd2096xxx  treatment induced marked
alterations in the plasma hdl profile in huaitg mice. as
measured by native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, the mean apparent diameter of the most prominent hdl
subpopulation rose from 11.7 nm in untreated huaitg mice
toward 15.0 and 18.0 nm in animals treated with 0.02 and 0.2%
 xxxd2096xxx , respectively (fig. 1).
 xxxg1782xxx ,  xxxg1305xxx , and hl activities in huaitg mice—to determine whether the modifications observed in hdl physicochemical characteristics induced by  xxxd2096xxx  were linked to those
of activities of lipoprotein modifying enzymes, we measured
 xxxg1782xxx ,  xxxg1305xxx , and hl in the plasma of huaitg mice.  xxxg1782xxx 
activity measured in treated and nontreated mice is shown in
fig. 2a.  xxxd2096xxx  significantly increased  xxxg1782xxx  activity in a
dose-dependent fashion from 7 ␮mol/ml/h in nontreated mice to
22 and 37 ␮mol/ml/h in mice fed with 0.02 and 0.2%  xxxd2096xxx ,
respectively.
 xxxg1305xxx  activity was measured in the same animals using an
exogenous substrate. the low dose of  xxxd2096xxx  did not significantly modify  xxxg1305xxx  activity as compared with controls,
whereas enzyme activity was 3-fold lower with the high dose of
 xxxd2096xxx  as compared with the nontreated animals (fig. 2a).

hl activity measured in postheparin plasma was not modified
by  xxxd2096xxx  treatment (results not shown).
effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on  xxxg1782xxx  and  xxxg1305xxx  mrna levels in
livers of human apoai transgenic mice—phospholipid transfer and cholesterol esterification activities measured in the
present study reflect plasma  xxxg1782xxx  and  xxxg1305xxx  concentrations,
respectively. we thus checked whether the modifications of the
enzyme plasma levels induced by  xxxd2096xxx  were due to
changes in their gene expression levels. as shown in fig. 2b,
the levels of hepatic  xxxg1782xxx  mrna significantly rose in a dosedependent manner in  xxxd2096xxx -treated huaitg mice with
approximately 4- and 10-fold increases in  xxxg1782xxx  mrna levels
observed in animals treated with 0.02 or 0.2%  xxxd2096xxx ,
respectively. unlike for the  xxxg1782xxx  gene,  xxxd2096xxx  did not
produce significant changes in the levels of  xxxg1305xxx  mrna in the
livers of huaitg treated mice (fig. 2b).
effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on plasma lipoproteins in nontransgenic mice—given that the expression of both human apoai
and murine  xxxg1782xxx  genes are increased concomitantly in huaitg animals, the contribution of  xxxg1782xxx  induction to the  xxxd2096xxx -induced changes in hdl size was assessed using nontransgenic mice. in nontreated wild-type c57bl/6 mice, the
analysis of hdl size showed a monodisperse population of
hdl with a mean apparent diameter of 11.0 nm (fig. 3). as
observed in huaitg mice (see above),  xxxd2096xxx  treatment of
wild-type mice produced a shift of plasma hdl toward the
large size range. one new discrete subfraction of 12.9-nm diameter appeared in mice treated with 0.02%  xxxd2096xxx , and

those described in the legend of fig. 1. au, absorbance units; ff,

13.1-nm-diameter particles became predominant in mice
treated with 0.2%  xxxd2096xxx .
effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on  xxxg1782xxx ,  xxxg1305xxx , and hl nontransgenic
mice—in nontransgenic c57bl/6 mice,  xxxd2096xxx  significantly increased  xxxg1782xxx  activity in a dose-dependent fashion
from 5 ␮mol/ml/h in nontreated mice to 15 and 25 ␮mol/ml/h in
mice fed with the 0.02 and 0.2% doses of  xxxd2096xxx , respectively (fig. 4a).  xxxg1305xxx  activity decreased significantly in
c57bl/6 mice treated with 0.02%  xxxd2096xxx  and even to a
greater extent at the highest dose tested (0.2%) (fig. 4a). hl
was not significantly modified by treatment with  xxxd2096xxx 
(data not shown).
as shown in fig. 4b, the levels of  xxxg1782xxx  mrna in mouse liver
rose significantly in a dose-dependent manner in fenofibratetreated c57bl6 mice as compared with nontreated controls
with approximately 7- and 10-fold increases at the 0.02 and
0.2% doses, respectively (fig. 4b). unlike for the  xxxg1782xxx  gene,
the levels of  xxxg1305xxx  mrna in the liver from c57bl6 mice were
only marginally altered after treatment with  xxxd2096xxx  with
approximately 20 and 30% decreases at the 0.02 and 0.2%
doses, respectively (fig. 4b).
effect of  xxxd2096xxx  on hdl size distribution in pltpdeficient mice—because  xxxd2096xxx  exerts a marked effect on
the expression of  xxxg1782xxx  in both huaitg and wild-type mice, the
relative contribution of  xxxg1782xxx  to the observed alterations in
hdl structure was determined by comparing the effect of
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment on hdl size distribution in wild-type
and  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice. in agreement with data presented
above, treatment of wild-type mice with 0.2%  xxxd2096xxx  pro-

hdl structure and metabolism are modulated by fibric acid
derivatives in humans as well as in rodents. whereas most
attention has been paid to the effects of fibrates on apoai and
 xxxg174xxx , their effects on the expression of other proteins involved in hdl metabolism have not been studied previously.
 xxxg1305xxx  is associated with hdl in that it generates cholesteryl
esters and lysophospholipids with phospholipids and free cholesterol as substrates, driving as such the further influx of free
cholesterol into hdl. as a result of the  xxxg1305xxx -mediated influx
of core lipids, hdl tends to enlarge (28). conversely, shrinkage
of hdl as the consequence of phospholipid and triglyceride
hydrolysis by hl leads to the emergence of small hdl (29).
 xxxg1782xxx  by facilitating phospholipid transfer between lipoproteins plays an important role in hdl remodeling, favoring the
appearance of both large and lipid-poor apoai-containing particles (9). thus, plasma hdl metabolism in mice (i.e. a  xxxg432xxx -deficient species) is mainly dependent on  xxxg1305xxx , hl, and  xxxg1782xxx  activities. given that hdl
was previously shown to undergo significant structural
changes as the result of  xxxd2096xxx  treatment in huaitg mice
(16), we postulated that one or several enzyme/transfer activities involved in hdl metabolism are modulated by  xxxd2096xxx . therefore, the aim of the present study was to search for
potential alterations in  xxxg1305xxx ,  xxxg1782xxx , and hl in several mouse
lines treated or not with  xxxd2096xxx .
the most striking finding of the present study is the marked
dose-dependent increase in  xxxg1782xxx  activity and hepatic mrna
in huaitg and wild-type mice treated with  xxxd2096xxx . the
increase in hdl size was the initial finding associated with
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment in huaitg mice (16), and consistent
observations were made in the present study in both huaitg
and nontransgenic mice (figs. 1 and 3). based on previous in
vivo and in vitro observations, the increase in  xxxg1782xxx  activity
due to  xxxd2096xxx  would predictably have resulted in increased
␣hdl size. in further support of the latter view, incubation of
purified  xxxg1782xxx  with isolated hdl induced the appearance of a
population of larger hdl particles (8), and a positive relation-

duced a marked 2-fold rise in plasma  xxxg1782xxx  activity (data not
shown). as expected (19),  xxxg1782xxx  activity was undetectable in
homozygous  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice whether they were treated or
not with  xxxd2096xxx  (data not shown). hdl size was measured
in both wild-type and  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice (n ⫽ 4/group). a
representative profile of an animal of each group is shown in
fig. 5. in treated wild-type mice, two types of hdl of 12.8 ⫾ 0.5
and 11.4 ⫾ 0.1 nm were observed, whereas hdl was monodisperse in nontreated wild-type mice (11.0 ⫾ 0.5 nm). in contrast,
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment did not produce any detectable effect on
the size distribution of plasma hdl (9.7 ⫾ 0.6 and 9.3 ⫾ 0.4 nm
in nontreated versus treated  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice).
effects of  xxxd2096xxx  in ppar␣-deficient mice—because  xxxd2096xxx  has been shown to exert its effect by modifying the
expression of a number of genes via activation of the nuclear
receptor ppar␣, we examined whether the observed change in
 xxxg1782xxx  was dependent on ppar␣ activation by carrying out
experiments in ppar␣-deficient mice. wild-type and ppar␣deficient mice were treated with the same dose of  xxxd2096xxx 
(0.2%). treatment of ppar␣⫹/⫹ mice with  xxxd2096xxx  increased  xxxg1782xxx  activity from 4 to 13 ␮mol/ml/h, whereas no
increase in  xxxg1782xxx  activity was observed in treated ppar␣⫺/⫺
mice (fig. 6a). as shown in fig. 6b, basal  xxxg1782xxx  mrna levels
were comparable in wild-type and ppar␣⫺/⫺ mice. by contrast,  xxxd2096xxx  treatment induced a significant 4-fold increase in  xxxg1782xxx  mrna levels in livers of wild-type mice,
whereas no changes in  xxxg1782xxx  mrna levels were observed in
ppar␣⫺/⫺ animals.

ship between  xxxg1782xxx  activity and hdl size was observed in
different inbred mouse strains (30). however, in vivo studies in
genetically engineered mice yielded somewhat controversial
data with regard to the role of  xxxg1782xxx  in determining the size
distribution of ␣hdl (11, 19, 31–33). in particular, an increase
in  xxxg1782xxx  activity in human  xxxg1782xxx  transgenic mice or adenovirus-infected mice was associated with either no marked
changes or a net increase in mean ␣hdl size (11, 31–34). this,
heterogeneity of experimental data concerning the role of  xxxg1782xxx 
in hdl structure might relate at least in part to marked
differences in the plasma levels and tissue expression of  xxxg1782xxx 
in the distinct mouse models (11, 19, 31–33). in this respect,
stimulation of  xxxg1782xxx  expression by  xxxd2096xxx  in wild-type as
well as in huaitg mice indicates that pharmacological modification of  xxxg1782xxx  expression results in pronounced alterations
in hdl structure and metabolism.
although in the present studies  xxxd2096xxx  treatment led to
increases in hdl size in both huaitg and nontransgenic mice,
clear differences in hdl size distribution appeared between
the two mouse lines (figs. 1 and 3). in huaitg mice treated
with the high dose of  xxxd2096xxx , very large hdl, almost of
human ldl size, was observed much similar to those recently
described in huaitg mice strongly expressing human  xxxg1782xxx 
after receiving an adenovirus infection (32). in nontransgenic
wild-type mice,  xxxd2096xxx  led to weaker changes in hdl size
distribution. interestingly and as already observed (11, 32),
 xxxg1782xxx  activity is clearly higher in huaitg mice than in nontransgenic animals. thus, higher  xxxg1782xxx  activity in huaitg

mice could account for the greater increase in hdl size as
compared with control animals (11, 32). the amounts of  xxxg1782xxx 
in huaitg versus nontransgenic mice may be due to the fact
that  xxxg1782xxx  displays a higher affinity for large hdl than for
small hdl (35). thus, even though  xxxd2096xxx  exerts a similar
effect on  xxxg1782xxx  gene expression in both huaitg and nontransgenic mice, the overexpression of human apoai would clearly
emphasize the  xxxg1782xxx -mediated hdl changes.
 xxxd2096xxx  decreased plasma  xxxg1305xxx  activity, but unlike
 xxxg1782xxx  gene expression  xxxg1305xxx  gene expression was only marginally reduced in wild-type mice, and no change in  xxxg1305xxx  mrna
levels was observed in huaitg mice. because  xxxg1305xxx  activity
values in the present study mainly reflect  xxxg1305xxx  mass concentration, the results indicate that  xxxd2096xxx  significantly decreased the concentration of  xxxg1305xxx  in the plasma of fenofibratetreated animals. interestingly, decreased  xxxg1305xxx  activity has
already been noted in mice overexpressing  xxxg1782xxx  (32), and it is
conceivable that  xxxg1305xxx  has a lower affinity for large hdl than
for small particles. although to our knowledge no study has
directly examined this point in mice, it is noteworthy that the
shift in hdl size toward small hdl in mice transgenic for both
human apoai and  xxxg432xxx  as compared with huaitg mice was associated with a concomitant
increase in  xxxg1305xxx  mass (36). all together, these data suggest
therefore that a substantial increase in the mean hdl size
would secondarily result in lower plasma  xxxg1305xxx  levels because
of a weaker lipoprotein affinity (and thus a faster catabolism) of
the enzyme. in other words and in contrast to increased plasma
 xxxg1782xxx  levels, decreased plasma  xxxg1305xxx  levels would be the consequence and not the cause of the hdl enlargement in  xxxd2096xxx -treated mice.
in direct support of a key role of  xxxg1782xxx  in the hdl enlargement in treated mice, the present study demonstrated for the
first time that the hdl size redistribution induced by  xxxd2096xxx  is completely abolished in homozygous  xxxg1782xxx -deficient
animals. although fibric acid derivatives are known to affect
mouse lipoprotein metabolism in several distinct ways, in particular through the regulation of the expression of a number of
proteins, the lack of hdl size redistribution in fenofibratetreated  xxxg1782xxx -deficient mice clearly indicates that  xxxg1782xxx  overexpression is the most important if not the sole mechanism that
accounts for the observed hdl enlargement. nevertheless and
as demonstrated in the present studies in huaitg mice, the
impact of  xxxg1782xxx  on hdl size can be markedly modulated by the
level of apolipoprotein gene expression.
because fibrates exert their effects through activation of the
transcription factor ppar␣ (15), it has been postulated that
the increase in hepatic  xxxg1782xxx  mrna was mediated through a
ppar␣-dependent mechanism. it can be concluded from the
present study that  xxxd2096xxx  affects  xxxg1782xxx  gene expression via
the activation of the nuclear receptor ppar␣. several other
genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism are transcriptionally
induced by ppar␣ activation. indeed, fibrates activate ppar␣,
which after heterodimerization with another nuclear receptor,
the retinoid x receptor, interacts with specific response elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements in the
regulatory sequences of target genes. the binding of ppar␣retinoid x receptor heterodimer to a peroxisome proliferator
response element leads to altered gene expression (37). it can,
therefore, be suggested that the promoter of the mouse hepatic
 xxxg1782xxx  gene contains a functional peroxisome proliferator response element, but a direct demonstration of its presence
remains to be done.
in conclusion, results of the present study established for the
first time that  xxxd2096xxx  induces the expression of murine
 xxxg1782xxx  in liver through a ppar␣-dependent mechanism. the

 xxxd2096xxx  induces  xxxg1782xxx  gene expression in mouse
resulting rise in plasma  xxxg1782xxx  activity was shown to account
for the hdl size enlargement in plasma from treated animals.
finally, the absence of hdl size changes in  xxxg1782xxx -deficient
mice clearly demonstrated that  xxxg1782xxx  is a key factor in determining the size distribution of ␣hdl in vivo.
