abstract
recent advances in molecular biology and complementary information derived from neuropharmacology, biochemistry and behavior
have dramatically increased our understanding of various aspects of gaba a receptors. these studies have revealed that the gaba a
receptor is derived from various subunits such as a 1 –a 6 , b 1 –b 3 , g 1 –g 3 , d, ´, p, and r1 – 3. furthermore, two additional subunits žb 4 ,
g4 . of gaba a receptors in chick brain, and five isoforms of the r-subunit in the retina of white perch ž roccus americana. have been
identified. various techniques such as mutation, gene knockout and inhibition of gaba a receptor subunits by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been used to establish the physiologicalrpharmacological significance of the gaba a receptor subunits and their native
receptor assemblies in vivo. radioligand binding to the immunoprecipitated receptors, co-localization studies using immunoaffinity
chromatography and immunocytochemistry techniques have been utilized to establish the composition and pharmacology of native
gaba a receptor assemblies. partial agonists of gaba a receptors are being developed as anxiolytics which have fewer and less severe
side effects as compared to conventional benzodiazepines because of their lower efficacy and better selectivity for the gaba a receptor
subtypes. the subunit requirement of various drugs such as anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, general anesthetics, barbiturates, ethanol and
neurosteroids, which are known to elicit at least some of their pharmacological effects via the gaba a receptors, have been investigated
during the last few years so as to understand their exact mechanism of action. furthermore, the molecular determinants of clinically
important drug-targets have been investigated. these aspects of gaba a receptors have been discussed in detail in this review article.

1. introduction
g- xxxd2177xxx  žgaba. is a major inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system.
gaba activates three different receptor classes such as
gaba a , gaba b and gaba c receptors. gaba a receptors are ligand-gated chloride ion channels w21,286x. these
receptors are activated by gaba, muscimol and isoguvacine, and are inhibited by bicuculline, gabazine žsr
95531. and žq.-b-hydrastine w345x. gaba b receptors are
activated by gaba, žy.-baclofen, ž".-4-amino-3-ž5chloro-2-thienyl.butanoic acid and 3-aminopropylžmethyl.phosphinic acid žskf 97541., and are inhibited by
phaclofen, saclofen and 2-hydroxysaclofen w275x. these
receptors are known to be coupled to ca2q or kq channels
via g proteins so as to activate the second messenger
systems within the cell w21,24x. gaba c receptors are
derived from various isoforms of the r-subunit, and are
directly associated with chloride ion channels. these receptors are activated by gaba and certain conformationally restricted analogues of gaba such as cis-4aminocrotonic acid žcaca. and trans-4-aminocrotonic
acid žtaca., and are inhibited by imidazole-4-acetic acid
w22x and wž1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl.methylphosphinic
acidx žtpmpa. w260x but are insensitive to bicuculline,
barbiturates, benzodiazepines and baclofen w83,253,353x.
recently, it has been proposed that gaba c receptors
should be classified as a specialized set of the gaba a
receptors w10x. the gaba a receptors are of great importance as they play a pivotal role in the regulation of brain
excitability, and many important drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, ethanol, and some of
the anticonvulsants and general anesthetics interact with
these receptors so as to elicit their pharmacological effects.
2. gaba a receptor subunits
gaba a receptor is a transmembrane hetero-oligomeric
protein which is expressed in the peripheral and central
nervous system. the deduced amino acid sequences of
gaba a receptor subunits show significant sequence identity ž20% to 30%. with other ligand-gated ion channels
such as the  xxxg456xxx ,  xxxg904xxx  and  xxxg1116xxx . several subunit classes and isoforms within each class of the gaba a receptor have been
cloned in the mammalian brain. amino acid identity among
isoforms of the same class is ; 70% whereas the identity
among classes is ; 30%. various subunits of the gaba

receptors are a 1 –a 6 , b 1 –b 3 , g 1 –g 3 , d, ´, p, and r 1 –r 3
w34,55–57,61,121,177,181,230,232,280,365x. receptor assemblies derived from various isoforms of the r-subunit
are suggested to be classified as gaba c receptors
w230,280x as these receptors are insensitive to both bicuculline and baclofen. however, it has been proposed recently that the r-subunit containing receptors are best
classified as a specialized set of the gaba a receptors w10x
since r-subunits are structurally part of the family of
gaba a receptor subunits despite of their distinctive regulatory binding sites w230,280x. furthermore, two additional
subunits žb 4 , g4 . of gaba a receptors in chick brain
w12,119x, and five isoforms of the r-subunit in the retina of
white perch ž roccus americana. w254x have been identified. there are also reports that some of the subunits exist
as splice variants w12,118,156,158,346x. the g 2-subunit is
expressed as g 2s žshort form. and g 2l žlong form. variants. the g 2l variant contains an eight amino acid insert
between  xxxg2318xxx  and tm4 which provides a potential phosphorylation site w156,346x. two splice variants of the
a 6-subunit have also been reported w158x. however, the
short form of a 6-subunit does not form functional receptors w158x. other examples of subunit splice variants are
chicken b 2 and b 4 genes w12,118x, and human b 3 gene
w154x. distribution of major subunits in various regions of
brain has been investigated w354x. briefly, the a 1-subunit
is present predominantly in the cerebellum, whereas the
hippocampus has low levels. in contrast, the a 2 – 5-subunits
are present predominantly in the hippocampus, whereas
cerebellum is practically devoid of these subunits. cerebral
cortex has intermediate levels of a 1 – 4-subunits and low
levels of a 5-subunit. the a 6-subunit is present in the
cerebellar granule cells, whereas hippocampus and cerebral
cortex are devoid of this subunit. the relative distribution
of b 1- and b 3-subunits is as follow: hippocampus) cortex
) cerebellum, whereas the rank for the b 2-subunit levels is
cerebellum ) cortex ) hippocampus w171,354x. interestingly, the g1-subunit mrna is expressed predominantly in
amygdala and septum, in contrast to most of the gaba a
receptor subunits which are mainly expressed in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and shows little change with
postnatal development w343,354,359x. the g 2-subunit is
present in abundant amount in almost every region of the
brain, whereas the g 3-subunit is present mainly in the
cortex and basal nuclei w354x. there is also report that the
levels of g 2s -subunit are more abundant than the g 2l -subunit levels in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb w103x. in contrast, the inferior colliculus, medulla

and cerebellum have more g 2l - vs. g 2s-subunit w103x. the
d-subunit is present predominantly in cerebellum, whereas
hippocampus and cortex have low levels of this subunit
w354x. thalamus contains intermediate levels of d-subunit,
and high levels of a 4-subunit w354x. the ´-subunit mrna
is present in amygdala, thalamus and subthalamic nucleus
w57x. on the other hand, the p-subunit has been reported to
be present in lung, thymus, prostate and uterus w121x.
although, various isoforms of the r-subunit are known to
be localized in the retina w55,56,73,195,230,254x, it has
been shown recently that the r 1 – 3-subunits are also expressed in the rat brain regions such as superior colliculus,
cerebellar purkinje cells and hippocampus w23x. immunoblot studies using antibodies to various subunits of
gaba a receptors have revealed the molecular mass of
these subunits as follows: a 1 s 50–51 kda, a 2 s 52–53
kda, a 3  xxxd2913xxx –61 kda, a 4 s 66–67 kda, a 5 s 53–55 kda,
a 6 s 57–58 kda, b 1 s 57kda, b 2 s 54–57 kda, b 3 s 57
kda, g 1 s 45–51 kda, g 2 s 43–49 kda, g 2s s 45 kda,
g 2l s 47 kda, g 3 s 43–46 kda, and d s 54 kdaw16–
19, 61, 69, 72, 149, 150, 152, 153, 171, 178, 194, 195, 207, 257,
259,298,305x. the polyclonal anti-a 1 antibody, raised by
us in a rabbit against the synthetic peptide corresponding
to the amino acids 1–15 of the rat a 1-subunit of gaba a
receptors, recognized a protein band of 51 kda in immunoblots, whereas the polyclonal anti-b 2 antibody, raised
by us in a rabbit against the synthetic peptide aglprhsfgrna w171x corresponding to the amino acid residues
382–393 of the rat b 2-subunit of gaba a receptors, recognized a protein band of 55 kda in immunoblots.

3. subunit composition of native gaba a receptors and
their binding characteristics
gaba a receptor is a pentameric assembly derived
from a combination of various subunits. elucidation of
these assemblies of native gaba a receptors is a very
challenging task since several different types of receptor
assemblies can be derived theoretically from a combination of various subunits. there are reports indicating that
the a 1 , b 2r3 , and g 2-subunits co-exist in many native
gaba a receptors w16,149,298x. furthermore, it is known
that two different isoforms of the a- w5,8,19,69,72,
151,152,160,176,207,242,243,330x, b- w171x, or g-subunit
w17,150,151,257x can co-localize in the same receptor assembly. however, the preferred pentameric combination
includes two a , two g, and one b-subunits w8x, or two a ,
two b, and one g-subunits w39x. recently, it has been
suggested that a total of four alternating a and b-subunits
are connected by a g-subunit in a pentameric gaba a
receptor assembly w319x. the preferred stoichiometry of
gaba a receptor subtype probably varies among different
brain regions. in an attempt to elucidate the complete
pentameric composition of a brain receptor, the cerebellar
receptor assemblies have been proposed as a 1 a 6 g 2s-

g 2l b 2r3 , a 1 a 6 b 2r3 g 2 d, a 1b 2r3 g 2 , a 6 b 2r3 g 2 , a 1 a 6b 2 r 3 g 2 , a 1 b 2 r 3 g 2 d, and a 6 b 2 r 3 d w 36,37,151,
152,159,160,207,243,258x. however, recent studies have
demonstrated that d-subunit does not co-localize with gsubunit in native gaba a receptor assemblies w4,259x. the
diazepam-insensitive benzodiazepine-site in the human
cortex has been reported to be composed of the a 4-, b 2-,
and g 2l -subunits w357x.
although co-expression of the a-, b- and g-subunits is
required for the formation of fully functional gaba a
receptors and most of the native gaba a receptor assemblies consist of these subunits yet the co-localization of
these three types of subunits is not an absolute requirement
for the formation of the gaba a receptor. it is known that
the mice devoid of the g 2-subunit were able to express
functional gaba a receptors, though devoid of the benzodiazepine binding site, in unaltered numbers from the
remaining subunits w101x. in contrast, when the a 5- w88x,
a 6- w127,140x, or b 3-subunit w126x gene was inactivated,
some of the brain gaba a receptors were lost. these
observations suggest that the a- and b-subunits, unlike the
g 2-subunit, are essential components for the receptor assembly and membrane targeting of the gaba a receptors.
furthermore, it has been suggested that each receptor
subtype has its own target identity depending on the
subunits, and highly selective recognition processes operate to ensure differential assembly and subcellular distribution of the receptor subtypes within a cell w88–90,216,228x.
during the last few years, localization of various binding sites on the gaba a receptors has been investigated.
these studies have indicated that the high affinity
gabarmuscimol binding site is localized at the interface
of the a- and b-subunits of gaba a receptors w246,364x.
the b-subunit of gaba a receptors has been suggested as
a necessary requirement for the tbps binding site
žpicrotoxin site. w288,364x. although the homo-oligomeric
gaba a receptors derived from b 3-subunit exhibit a specific high affinity binding for w35 sxtbps, the gaba a
receptor assemblies consisting of a 1b 3 g 2- or a 1b 3-subunits have higher affinity for w35 sxtbps over those consisting of b 3 g 2- or b 3-subunits w288,364x. benzodiazepine
žbz. site is localized at the interface of the a- and
g-subunits of gaba a receptors w355,364x. therefore, the
gaba a receptor assemblies containing two isoforms of
the a- as well as g-subunit would have two benzodiazepine sites in the same receptor assembly w152x. receptors containing the a 1-subunit mimic bz i pharmacology,
whereas those containing the a 2-, a 3-, or a 5-subunit
variant display bz ii pharmacology w16,189,194,207,
247,363x. bz ii receptors have lower affinity for cl
218872, b-ccm and zolpidem as compared to bz i receptors w16,189,194,207,247,363x. however, receptors containing the a 5-subunit variant lack affinity for zolpidem
and its analogues w109,194,197,207,247x but have high
affinity for ro 15-4513 žsarmazenil. w109,197x, a partial
 xxxd1422xxx  of the benzodiazepine site. bz i receptors,

a.k. mehta, m.k. ticku r brain research reõiews 29 (1999) 196–217

gaba a receptor assemblies containing a 1- and g-subunits, are present predominantly in the cerebellum but are
scarce in the hippocampus, whereas bz ii receptors are
expressed in abundance in the hippocampus and almost
absent in the cerebellum w80,81,197,231x. however, both
receptor types, i.e., bz i and bz ii receptors are equally
expressed in the cerebral cortex w81,231x. a specific ligand, w3 hxzolpidem ž k d f 7 nm., for the bz i receptors has
been developed w6x. similarly, w3 hxl-655,708 ž k d f 2 nm.
w256x and w3 hxry 80 ž k d f 0.7 nm. w287x have been
developed as ligands for bz ii receptors derived from the
a 5-subunit. conventional benzodiazepines such as diazepam, flunitrazepam and clonazepam failed to bind to
the gaba a receptor assemblies containing benzodiazepine site derived from the a 4- or a 6-subunit, whereas
ro 15-4513 and some of the benzodiazepine receptor
partial agonists have high affinity for these diazepam-insensitive receptors w152,153,178,198,258,313x. moreover,
inverse agonists such as dmcm, b-cce, b-ccm, and
fg-7142 showed 7 to 10 times higher affinity for
the a 4 b 2 g 2l vs. a 6 b 2 g 2l gaba a receptors w357x.
w3 hxmuscimol binds with high affinity to the a 4- w153,352x
as well as a 6-subunit w152x containing gaba a receptors.
the a 6-subunit containing receptor assemblies are localized in cerebellar granule cells w178,258,305x, whereas
those containing the a 4-subunit variant are localized in
various brain regions such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamusrhypothalamus, striatum and olfactory bulb
w19,153,352x, and retina w195x. radioligand binding to the
immunoprecipitated receptors using polyclonal antibodies
to various g-subunits has revealed that the g 1- or g 3-subunit containing receptor assemblies are of low abundance
w17x. furthermore, the g 3-receptor population displayed a
reduced affinity for clonazepam and flunitrazepam, and
virtually lacked sensitivity to zolpidem w17x. the g1-receptor assembly displayed low affinity for most of the benzodiazepine site ligands except flunitrazepam, and can be
differentiated from those containing the g 2- or g 3-subunit
by its low affinity for the  xxxd1422xxx  b-ccm and its
lack of affinity for the partial  xxxd1422xxx  ro 15-4513
žsarmazenil. as well as for the ro 15-1788 žflumazenil., a
competitive antagonist of the benzodiazepine site w17x. it is
thus evident that the g 1-subunit receptor assemblies are not
involved in mediating all major effects of benzodiazepines
in vivo since these effects are susceptible to blockade by
flumazenil. replacement of the g-subunit by a d-subunit in
the expression studies produces a gaba a receptor which
is not potentiated by benzodiazepines w269,270,281x. polyclonal antisera raised against the d-subunit has been reported to immunoprecipitate the w3 hxro 15-1788 binding
sites w18x, thereby suggesting that the gaba a receptors
containing d-subunit have a benzodiazepine binding site
which has a novel pharmacology w207x. although the
d-subunit is reported to co-localize with a 1-, a 3-, a 5-,
a 6-, and b 2r3-subunits in various receptor assemblies
w140,207x, it does not co-localize with the g-subunit in

199

native gaba a receptors according to recent studies
w4,259x. these results make it difficult to explain the
discrepancy between the expression study data and the
immunoprecipitation results. however, recent studies have
indicated that the polyclonal antiserum raised against dsubunit immunoprecipitates only the w3 hxmuscimol binding
sites, whereas the w3 hxro 15-1788 or w3 hxflunitrazepam
binding sites are not immunoprecipitated by this antibody
in the rat brain w4,259x in contradiction to the findings of
benke et al. w18x. transfection of cells with a combination
of a-, b- and ´-subunits results in the expression of
gaba-activated currents and w35 sxtbps binding sites w57x.
however, these transfected cell membranes did not bind
either w3 hxro 15-1788 or w3 hxflunitrazepam w57x. transfection of cells with a combination of a , b, and p-subunits
results in the expression of both w3 hxmuscimol and
w35 sxtbps binding sites but no w3 hxro 15-1788 or
w3 hxflunitrazepam binding sites were detected w121x. when
the p-subunit was expressed with arbrg-subunit combination in transfection system, there was a reduction in the
density of w3 hxro 15-1788 binding sites w121x. in contrast
to earlier view regarding the homomeric nature of the
r-subunit receptor assemblies, it has been shown recently
that the rat retinal receptor assemblies derived from these
subunits are heteromeric and composed of at least r 1- and
r 2-subunits w365x, and both the r 1- and r 2-subunits are
necessary to form a functional receptor assembly w23x.
radioligand binding to the immunoprecipitated receptors using subunit-specific antibodies has been used as a
tool to establish and understand the composition and pharmacology of native gaba a receptor assemblies. these
studies have been conducted primarily in cerebral cortex,
cerebellum and whole brain using ligands of the gaba
binding site žw3 hxmuscimol. and the benzodiazepine site
žw3 hxflunitrazepam, w3 hxro 15-1788 and w3 hxro 15-4513..
the reported percentage of the binding sites immunoprecipitated by antisera to various subunits of gaba a receptors in the adult brain regions are as follows: a 1 s 70–97%,
a 2 s 4–28%, a 3 s 12–24%, a 4 s 0–15%, a 5 s 4–14%,
a 6 s 30–39% žcerebellum., b 1 s 2–32%, b 2 s 55–96%,
b 3 s 19–52%, g 1 s 0–19%, g 2 s 50–94%, g 2s s 31–
52%, g 2l s 37–65%, g 3 s 0–18%, and d s 0–23%
w16,19,61,151–153,171,178,189,194,207,257,258,283,347x.
we have recently observed that the polyclonal anti-a 1
antibody, raised by us in a rabbit against the synthetic
peptide corresponding to the amino acids 1–15 of the rat
a 1-subunit of gaba a receptors, elicits higher percentage

regions of the rat brain w102,104–106,209,211x as well as
radioligand binding to the gaba a receptors
w75,211,264,265x. however, age-related changes in the
mrna expression of a particular subunit does not necessarily lead to similar changes in protein or assembly into
mature gaba a receptors, and it has been proposed that
complex regulatory mechanisms of gaba a receptor expression exist at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational andror assembly levels, which vary with the
subunit and brain area w105x. recently, insulin has been
reported to increase the number of functional postsynaptic
gaba a receptor assemblies w340x, whereas chronic gaba
exposure results in the down-regulation of gaba a receptors w108,186,204,263x.

4. molecular determinants of gaba a receptors
in an attempt to characterize the molecular determinants
of clinically important drug-targets, several amino acids
have been identified that are important for binding of
ligands to the gaba and benzodiazepine sites. it has been
reported that tyr 157, thr 160 , thr 202 and tyr 205 amino acid
residues of the b-subunit w3x and phe 64 of the a 1-subunit
w284,291x are important for the binding of gaba. his101
žor his102 in human. w70,349x and gly 200 žor gly 201 in
human. w248x amino acid residues of the a-subunit, and
phe77 , met 130 and thr 142 amino acid residues of the
g-subunit w31,33,214,350x are reported to be key determinants of the benzodiazepine site of the rat gaba a receptors. moreover, his102 amino acid residue of the a-subunit
interacts directly with the pendant phenyl group of diazepam, flunitrazepam, chlordiazepoxide and other 5phenyl benzodiazepines w193,366x. this his residue is
absent in the a 4-subunit, and it is replaced by arg žarg 100 .
in the a 6-subunit of the humanrrat gaba a receptors.
these differences in the a 4- and a 6-subunits make the
gaba a receptor assemblies, derived from the a 4- or
a 6-subunit, insensitive to conventional benzodiazepines
such as diazepam, flunitrazepam and clonazepam w152,
153,178,198,258,313x. however, the replacement of arg 100
residue by gln100 in the a 6-subunit of alcohol-sensitive
žalcohol-nontolerant. ant rat cerebellum alters the normal
diazepam-insensitive gaba a receptors into diazepamsensitive ones w157x. a single amino acid change, from a
glutamate to a glycine at position 225 in the a 3-subunit
sequence, substantially increases the affinity of the a 3subunit containing gaba a receptors for cl 218872 and
zolpidem w248x. amino acid residues at positions 159
žtyr 159 ., 161 žtyr 161 ., 162 žthr 162 ., 206 žthr 206 ., 209

žtyr 209 . and 211 žval 211 . on the a 1-subunit of gaba a
receptors influence affinities of the ligands for the benzodiazepine site, thereby suggesting that these amino acids also
form part of the benzodiazepine binding site
w2,30,32,272,348x. however, mutations of a 1gln203 , the
amino acid residue located at equal distance to a 1gly 200
and a 1thr 206 , did not affect the ligand binding, thereby
indicating that this amino acid does not interact with
benzodiazepines and related compounds w272x. it is thus
evident from these studies that three separate domains of
the a 1-subunit such as near his101 , tyr 159 –thr 162 and
gly 200 –val 211 are involved in the benzodiazepine binding.
similarly, two domains of the g 2-subunit, lys 41 –trp 82
and arg 114 –asp161, have been identified which are required for the high affinity benzodiazepine binding w20x.
although it has been speculated that the co-localization of
two isoforms of a-subunit and one g-subunit can form two
benzodiazepine sites in the same receptor-assembly provided both the a-subunits are in contact with the g-subunit
in the pentamer assembly, this hypothesis is unlikely to
hold true due to the fact that the g- and a-subunits
contribute key amino acids to the benzodiazepine site as
described above.
ser 270 as well as ala291 amino acid residues of the
a 2-subunit, and ser 265 as well as met 286 of the b 1-subunit
of gaba a receptor are reported to be important amino
acids for the action of clinically relevant concentrations of
the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane w162x. met 286 amino
acid residue of the b 1-subunit is important for the potentiation of the gaba response by the intravenous anesthetic
agent propofol but this amino acid is not involved in the
activation of the receptor by the high concentrations of
propofol w162x. furthermore, the extracellular amino-terminal half of the a 1-subunit plays an important role in the
propofol potentiation of pentobarbital-response w328x. the
extracellular n-terminal domain of the a 1-subunit w86x,
his 273 amino acid residue of the a 6-subunit w86x, his 267
residue of the b 1-subunit w130x, and his 292 amino acid of
the b 3-subunit w356x are important molecular determinants
of the zn2q binding site on the gaba a receptors. furthermore, it has been suggested that the cys–cys loop of
the large extracellular nh 2-terminal domain of the gaba
r 1-subunit plays an important role in the receptorrchannel
functions w175x.
several amino acids such as b 1 ser 409 , g 2s ser 327 and
g 2l ser 343 have been identified as potential target sites on
the gaba a receptors for the phosphorylation process
w164,182,223x in an on-going attempt to investigate the
role of the phosphorylation process, mediated through
pka, pkc and other kinases such as  xxxg2198xxx , on
the modulation of gaba a receptor functions w107,116,
118,148,164,169,180,182,223,224,296,312,339,344 x .
these studies have also revealed that all the major subunits
of gaba a receptors contain consensus sites for the phosphorylation process, and this process may be important in
a wide range of physiological and pathological processes

a.k. mehta, m.k. ticku r brain research reõiews 29 (1999) 196–217

in the central nervous system. recently, it has been
demonstrated that the b 2r3-subunitžs. of native gaba a
receptors are phosphorylated in situ, thereby providing a
direct evidence that the native gaba a receptors are indeed phosphorylated and modulated in situ by endogenous
kinases w339x. however, the detailed mechanism of phosphorylation and its physiological relevance are not precisely known currently.

5. physiological r pharmacological role of various
gaba a receptor subunits and their receptor assemblies
gaba a receptors play a very important role in anxiety.
currently, drugs which activate the benzodiazepine site of
gaba a receptors are widely used to relieve anxiety.
however, these classical anxiolytics are full agonists at
most of the gaba a receptor subtypes, and have several
side effects such as sedation, ataxia, amnesia, tolerence,
and physical dependence. during the last decade, attempts
have been made to dissociate their useful therapeutic effects from side effects by developing partial agonists of the
gaba a receptor subtypes. unfortunately, the physiologicalrpharmacological role of various native gaba a
receptor assemblies is not yet known. once this information becomes available, it will be much easier to synthesize
compounds selective for a particular receptor assembly so
as to get a desired therapeutic effect without any major
side effect. several approaches such as mutation, gene
knockout and the inhibition of expression of gaba a
receptor subunits by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have
been tried to establish the role of various subunits and their
receptor assemblies with a limited success so far as described below and summarized in table 1.
it has been suggested that motor control is a distinct
behavioral correlate of the a 6-subunit containing gaba a
receptors because the point mutation in the cerebellar
a 6-subunit containing gaba a receptors žreplacement of
arg 100 by gln100 . results in ethanol intolerance ženhanced
sensitivity to ethanol. in ant rats žalcohol-nontolerant

rats., thereby making the animals highly susceptible to the
impairment of postural reflexes by ethanol and benzodiazepines w157x. however, there were no differences in the
metabolism of ethanol w129x, its hypnotic effect w127x,
withdrawal-hyperexcitability w129x, or reversal of ethanol’s
effects by ro 15-4513 w127x in the a 6-deficient mice vs.
wild-type mice. furthermore, loss of righting reflex žinability to recover normal posture. as well as the immobilizing response to tail-clamp-stimulus in mice anesthetized
with volatile anesthetics, and sleep-time-response to pentobarbital did not differ between the a 6-deficient and wildtype mice w127x. interestingly, in the a 6-deficient cerebellar granule cells, the d-subunit is selectively degraded as
seen by immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry and
immunoblot analysis with d-subunit specific antibody,
thereby providing an evidence for a specific association
between the a 6 and d-subunits in cerebellar granule cells
w140x. cerebellar granule cells of the a 6-subunit deficient
mutant mice also have severe deficits in the high affinity
w3 hxmuscimolrw3 hxsr 95531 binding to the gaba sites,
diazepam-insensitive w3 hxro 15-4513 binding to the bz
sites, and furosemide-induced increases in the w35 sx tbutylbicyclophosphorothionate žtbps. binding to the  xxxd2947xxx -sensitive convulsant sites w185x. dmcm, allopregnanolone and zinc are less efficacious in these mice in
altering the w35 sxtbps binding in the presence of those
concentrations of gaba that fail to activate the a 1-subunit-containing gaba a receptors w185x. furthermore, the
inhibition of a 6-subunit by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
žodn. in cerebellar granule cells shifts the gaba dose–
response curve to the right and significantly increases the
ec 50 value of gaba ža decreased gaba-response.,
whereas the flunitrazepam-induced potentiation of
gaba-activated currents are enhanced w369x. some of the
above mentioned changes may be adaptive consequences
of altered gaba a receptor subunit expression pattern in
response to the gene knockout. on the other hand, the
g 2-subunit antisense odn reduces the ec 50 value and
shifts the dose–response curve for gaba to the left žan
enhanced gaba-response., and decreases the flunitrazepam-induced potentiation of gaba-activated currents
w369x. furthermore, the bolus infusion of antisense odn to
the gaba a receptor g 2-subunit is reported to inhibit the
in vivo formation of the benzodiazepine binding sites in
the rat cerebral cortex and striatum w146x, and in vivo
formation of the gaba,  xxxd2947xxx  and benzodiazepine
binding sites are also inhibited in the rat hippocampus
w147x, thereby resulting in an increase in the convulsive
threshold for b-ccm w367x, an  xxxd1422xxx  for the
benzodiazepine site. targeted disruption of the g 2-subunit
gene in mice w101x resulted in the depletion of 94% of the
benzodiazepine sites in the brain of neonatal mice, while
the number of gaba sites was only slightly reduced.
diazepam was inactive behaviorally in these mice. furthermore, these mice died within a few days after birth,
although their birth weight was normal and the major

peripheral organs, including pituitary, pancreas and adrenal
gland which are known to express gaba a receptors, did
not reveal any pathological changes. the surviving mutants exhibited excessive hyperactivity, impaired grasping,
impaired righting reflexes and abnormal gait. none of
these mutant mice survived beyond p18, although feeding
was apparently not impaired w101x. recently, mice devoid
of the g 2l -subunit have been produced w128x. these mice
are viable, healthy, and overtly indistinguishable from the
wild-type. however, there was up-regulation of the g 2s subunit as a result of compensatory mechanism in these
mutant mice devoid of the g 2l -subunit w128x. potentiation
of the gaba currents by ethanol as well as several
behavioral effects of ethanol such as sleep time, anxiolysis,
acute function tolerance and chronic withdrawal hyperexcitability were not altered in these mutant mice, thereby
suggesting that the g 2l -subunit is not required for the
modulatory effects of ethanol at the gaba a receptors
w128x. these results contradict the previous view that the
g 2l -subunit of gaba a receptor is a critical molecular site
of action for ethanol w335x but support the reports indicating that the presence of g 2l -subunit is not an absolute
requirement for the potentiation of gaba-induced responses by ethanol w190,285x. mice deficient in the b 3-subunit of gaba a receptor usually die as neonates w126x. the
mice that survive are runted until weaning, and have a
reduced life span. these mutant mice are fertile but mothers fail to nurture offspring w126x. brain morphology is
grossly normal but these mice are hyperactive, hyperresponsive to human contact and often run continuously in
tight circles w126x. when held by tail, these mutant mice
hold all the paws in like a ball. they also exhibit tremor,
jerky gait, cleft palate w53,54,126x and angelman syndrome w179,225,262,267x, an inherited neurobehavioral
disorder that is characterized in humans by seizures, ataxia,
stiff jerky movements, absence of speech and severe mental retardation. angelman syndrome in the b 3-subunit-deficient mice w179,225,262,267x is consistent with the report
that the gene encoding the gaba a receptor b 3-subunit
maps to the angelman syndrome region on chromosome
15, and deletion of this gene žgabrb3. is found in the
angelman syndrome patients w337x. furthermore, based on
gene knockout study, it has been reported that the b 3-subunit is important in the mediation of the immobilizing
response due to the volatile anesthetic agents such as
 xxxd1993xxx  and halothane w255x, whereas the loss of righting
reflex due to the volatile anesthetic agents and pentobarbital is not affected by the absence of b 3-subunit w255x.
however, the loss of righting reflex due to midazolam and
etomidate is attenuated by the absence of the b 3-subunit
w255x. administration of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the gaba a receptor a 2- or b 3-subunit into
striatum results in the increased behavioral sensitivity to
cocaine in rats, thereby suggesting the role of these subunits in determining cocaine-sensitivity w236x. although it
was thought that the deletion of a 5- and g 3-subunits may

result in neurological phenotype w225x, this possibility was
ruled out based on the observation that mutation of these
subunits does not result in any overt neurological phenotype in mice and thus does not provide useful animal
models for the angelman syndrome in humans w54,225x.
the above-mentioned studies suggest that the antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide treatment and gene-knockout techniques are useful tools for studying the regulation of
receptor structurerfunction and revealing the physiological
and pharmacological significance of various gaba a receptor subunits and their receptor assemblies.
in an attempt to investigate the role of a 4-subunit in
seizures, it has been shown that a 4-subunit mrna is
increased in the dentate gyrus at 4 h after the fifth amygdaloid kindled seizure w44x. however, another group of
investigators did not find any change in the a 4-subunit
mrna levels at 24 h after the sixth fully kindled seizure
elicited by schaffer collateral stimulation w144x. role of
the gaba a receptor a 4-subunit in kainic acid-induced
seizures in rats has also been investigated by several
researchers because these seizures in rats represent an
animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy. the
neuropathological events uderlying these seizures include
acute limbic seizures žstatus epilepticus. followed by neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, thereby ultimately
manifesting the spontaneous recurrent seizures after about
3 weeks. interestingly, recurrent spontaneous seizures following the administration of kainic acid result in the
up-regulation of a 4-subunit mrna w322x. furthermore,
the a 4-subunit immunoreactivity is also reported to be
increased in the rat hippocampus at 30 days after the
administration of kainic acid w274x. electroconvulsive shock
žecs. treatment has been shown recently to increase the
a 4-subunit mrna and the diazepam-insensitive w3 hxro
15-4513 binding in the dentate gyrus, thereby suggesting
that the a 4-subunit of gaba a receptor could be implicated in the clinical effects of electroconvulsive therapy
w43x. furthermore, the inhibition of a 4-subunit by the
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide is reported to prevent the
increased seizure susceptibility observed following progesterone withdrawal w292x. therefore, it has been speculated
that the a 4-subunit of gaba a receptor plays an important
role during periods of fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids associated with the menstrual
and pregnancy cycles in females and during stress in males
as well as females w292,293x. a long-lasting kindling phenomenon associated with chronic intermittent ethanol žcie.
treatment is also reported to result in an increase in the
a 4-subunit mrna levels in the thalamus, dentate gyrus,
ca1 and ca3 regions of hippocampus, and layers ii and
iii of the cortex, thereby further supporting the role of
a 4-subunit of gaba a receptors in seizures w183x. although the genetic studies have revealed that the differences between the highly prone dbar2j mice to juvenile
audiogenic seizures and the seizure-resistant c57blr6j
mice are due to several genetic factors w226x yet these two

a.k. mehta, m.k. ticku r brain research reõiews 29 (1999) 196–217

strains of mice do not differ in the a 1 – 3- w342x, b 1 – 3w143x, d- w341x, g 1- w343x and g 2-subunits w156x. however,
the comparison of a 4-subunit of gaba a receptors has
not been investigated in these mice.

6. interaction of drugs with gaba a receptors
several drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates,
neurosteroids, ethanol, some of the anticonvulsants, and
general anesthetics interact with gaba a receptors so as to
elicit their pharmacological effects. the role of gaba a
receptors in the action of these categories of drugs has
been reviewed from time to time by us and other researchers w282,308–310,313–316,347x. in this section, we
would summarize the recent developments in this area.
6.1. anxiolytics
in an attempt to dissociate the desired therapeutic effect
of anxiolytics acting at the benzodiazepine site of gaba a
receptors from their side effects, several new compounds
such as imidazenil w7,60,98,100,277,306x, abecarnil w155,
196,198,233,234,276,278,297,325x, bretazenil w27,84,
111,155,191,198,219,245,249x, and divaplon w82,93,137,
155x have been synthesized and evaluated for their pharmacological effects. some of these compounds are partial
agonists at some gaba a receptor subtypes and full agonists at others as is the case with abecarnil which is a
partial agonist at the a 5 b 2 g 2 gaba a receptor assembly
and a full agonist at a 3b 2 g 3 gaba a receptor assembly
w155x. on the other hand, divaplon is a partial agonist at
both a 3b 2 g 3 and a 5b 2 g 2 gaba a receptor assemblies
w155x, and imidazenil has low efficacy at a broad spectrum
of gaba a receptor subtypes w100x. as a result of these
features, these compounds are devoid of many, if not all,
side effects associated with conventional anxiolytic benzodiazepines because the lower intrinsic efficacy of the
gaba a receptor partial agonists is probably sufficient to
maintain the low efficacy responses such as anxiolytic and
anticonvulsant responses, but insufficient to induce sedation, myorelaxation, dependence and  xxxd102xxx potentiation,
which require high fractional receptor occupancy
w78,94,138,238x. accordingly, abecarnil is a potent anxiolytic and elicits no or only weak effects in tests of motor
incoordination and muscle relaxation, and has a relatively
weak ability to potentiate the effects of ethanol and barbiturates in contrast to diazepam w297x. the therapeutic
safety, defined as the ratio between the anticonvulsant
efficacy and the muscle relaxant action, is more favorable
for abecarnil as compared to diazepam in rodents and
baboon ž papio papio . w325x. abecarnil also elicits potent
anticonflict and taming effects with little sedative and
ataxic effects in primates w233x. chronic administration of
abecarnil was found to elicit persistent anxiolytic and
anticonvulsant effects without any amnesia in rats w234x,

203

and it did not induce tolerance or withdrawal syndromes in
mice w278x. interestingly, imidazenil, a potent anxiolytic, is
devoid of sedation, ataxia and  xxxd102xxx potentiation, and
blocks the sedative and ataxic effects of diazepam in rats
w100x. it also completely attenuates the benzodiazepine-induced cognition deficit in monkeys w306x. furthermore, it
causes only low tolerance and dependence liabilities in rats
w7x. chronic treatment with a pharmacologically effective
dose of imidazenil failed to induce tolerance to the effects
of this drug on gaba a receptor function in mouse brain
w98x. bretazenil elicits potent anticonflict and anticonvulsant activity but it results in a lower degree of sedation,
tolerance w111x, dependence liability w27,219x, and  xxxd102xxx potentiation w191x as compared to conventional benzodiazepines. likewise, divaplon elicits potent anticonflict
activity, and it results in lower sedation w93x and tolerance
w82, xxxd404xxx  as compared to diazepam. according to a recent
report, chronic exposure of primary cultured cerebellar
granule cells to the agonists of the benzodiazepine site
results in a reduction of the a 1-subunit protein expression,
and the magnitude of response depends upon the efficacy
of these agents w139x. therefore, it has been suggested that
this model may serve as an indicator of benzodiazepine
agonist efficacy with the ability to differentiate between
partial agonists of the benzodiazepine site w139x. chronic
treatment with conventional benzodiazepines, having full
agonistic effect, decreases the mrna levels of the a 1- and
g 2-subunits w123,145x, and increases the levels of the a 3and a 6-subunit mrna in the rat brain w229x. furthermore,
chronic treatment with the conventional benzodiazepines
decreases the efficacy of barbiturates as well as
agonistsrinverse agonists of the benzodiazepine site w133x,
uncouples the gaba and barbiturate sites from the benzodiazepine site w132x, and decreases coupling between the
benzodiazepine site and gaba a receptor-gated chloride
channels w132x. these changes may be responsible for
tolerance and dependence following chronic treatment with
conventional benzodiazepines.
6.2. anticonõulsants
loreclezole, an anticonvulsant, is reported to interact
with gaba a receptors w334x. it does not require the
presence of either an a- or a g-subunit of gaba a receptor, but is highly selective for gaba a receptor assemblies
containing the b 2r3-subunit versus b 1-subunit w334x. it has
a negligible affinity for the benzodiazepine site, and the
anticonvulsant effect could be reversed by some inverse
agonists of the benzodiazepine site but not by ro 15-1788
w59x. the interaction of loreclezole with gaba a receptors
has also been demonstrated in recombinant receptor system w85,351x. tiagabine, another anticonvulsant agent
w240,300x, elicits its effects as a result of inhibition of the
gaba uptake w25x, and it has a potential utility in the
treatment of chronic seizure disorders such as generalized
clonic–tonic epilepsy, photomyoclonic seizures, myoclonic

204

petit mal epilepsy and complex partial epilepsy w300x.
vigabatrin, i.e., g-vinyl gaba žgvg., is an inhibitor of
 xxxg8xxx , and it crosses the blood–brain
barrier žunlike gaba., thereby resulting in a dose-dependent long-lasting enhancement of the gaba concentration
in the brain w114,174x. it is an effective treatment for
partial complex seizures in pediatric and adult patients
with pharmacoresistance to the conventional antiepileptic
drugs w38,273x. gabapentin, a structural analogue of
gaba, was synthesized with the idea that it would elicit
the physiological actions of gaba in the brain. although
gabapentin, unlike gaba, crosses the blood–brain barrier
and elicits anticonvulsant effects w11,62x, it does not interact with gaba a or gaba b receptors. moreover, it is not
converted metabolically into gaba or agonist of gabareceptor and it is not an inhibitor of gaba uptake or of
gaba degradation w333x. however, it has been reported to
increase the gaba turnover by activation of glutamate
decarboxylase w304x. it has also been reported recently that
gabapentin increases the levels of gaba in the brains of
epileptic patients w239x and relieves partial epilepsy w38,
273x. gabapentin w188x and vigabatrin w66x have been
reported recently to attenuate the cocaine withdrawal and
craving by potentiating the gabaergic transmission. potentiation of the gabaergic system is also thought to be
involved in the anticonvulsant effects of valproate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and  xxxd2090xxx  in addition to the
ability of these drugs to block the voltage-dependent naq
channels andror glutamatergic mechanisms w174,199,310x.
gaba a receptor agonists such as thip žgaboxadol.
w92,201x and  xxxd3022xxx  w203,241x are reported to elicit
anticonvulsant effect in experimental animals. topiramate,
an anticonvulsant drug effective in treating simple or
complex partial seizures with or without secondarily generalization w261,266,279,303x, is reported to potentiate the
effect of gaba on chloride-flux mediated through gaba a
receptors w28x, besides its interaction with excitatory amino
acid receptors w49x and voltage-gated sodium channels
w48,370x. however, the exact molecular mechanism of its
anticonvulsant effect is not yet established.
6.3. general anesthetics
several general anesthetics of diverse structure such as
isoflurane,  xxxd1993xxx , halothane, barbiturates, etomidate,
steroid anesthetics and propofol have been reported to
interact with gaba a receptors at clinically relevant concentrations w9,46,112,115,141,172,237,327x. their exact
binding site on gaba a receptor and subunit requirement
are not yet fully established. mutation of the residues
within either a 2 žs270 or a291. or b 1 žs265 or m286.
subunits of gaba a receptor is reported to cause insensitivity to clinically relevant concentrations of the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane w162x. the b-subunit of gaba a
receptor appears to contribute to the direct actions of
propofol ž2, xxxd3030xxx ., an intravenous general

anesthetic which is used clinically these days w58,268x. a
point mutation in the b 1-subunit žm286w. abolished
potentiation of the gaba response by propofol but it did
not alter direct activation of the receptor by high concentrations of propofol w162x. furthermore, the a- and g 2l subunits influence both the direct and modulatory actions
of propofol on gaba a receptor function w167x. propofol
is also reported to potentiate the pentobarbital-induced
current, and the a 1-subunit of gaba a receptor is necessary for this modulatory action w328x. it seems that the
extracellular amino-terminal half of the a 1-subunit is sufficient to support the propofol potentiation of pentobarbitalresponse w328x. however, the direct activation of gaba a
receptor by propofol has been suggested to be a distinct
process mediated through a distinct site w328x. interestingly, propofol, unlike conventional benzodiazepines, potentiated the a 4 b 1g 2 gaba a receptor-mediated responses
comparable to those of the a 1b 1g 2 gaba a receptor
assembly w336x. however, it failed to elicit a direct activation of the a 4 b 1g 2 gaba a receptors w336x.
6.4. barbiturates
barbiturates have been known to elicit their pharmacological effects via the gaba a receptors. these drugs
potentiate the effect of gaba at lower concentrations and
activate the receptor directly at higher concentrations
through two distinct sites w3x. the a-subunit is reported to
influence the degree of efficacy žbut not affinity. of pentobarbital-induced potentiation of the gaba responses w307x.
however, the b-subunit does not have any marked effect
on the affinity or efficacy of the potentiating response
w110x. recently, pentobarbital has been shown to activate
the homomeric gaba a receptors containing b 3-subunit in
xenopus oocytes w328x. the a-subunit is reported to influence the affinity as well as efficacy of direct activation of
gaba a receptors by pentobarbital at higher concentrations w307x. interestingly, pentobarbital, unlike conventional benzodiazepines, potentiates the gaba responses
mediated through a 4 b 1g 2 as well as a 6 b 1g 2 gaba a
receptors w336x. moreover, pentobarbital was able to activate the a 6 b 1g 2 gaba a receptors directly, but it failed to
elicit a similar effect at the a 4 b 1g 2 gaba a receptors
w336x. chronic pentobarbital administration leads to tolerance and physical dependence. the d-subunit mrna in
the cerebellum is upregulated in the pentobarbital-tolerant
mice, and is down-regulated in the pentobarbital-withdrawn
mice w173x. these observations implicate the role of the
d-subunit of gaba a receptor in the action of pentobarbital. furthermore, the a 6-subunit mrna in the rat
cerebellum is upregulated in the pentobarbital-tolerant animals, thereby resulting in an enhancement of the diazepam-insensitive w3 hxro 15-4513 binding w136x. the
pentobarbital-dependent rats are also reported to express
the increased levels of the a 1- and g 2-subunit mrna of
gaba a receptor, whereas the decreased levels of mrna

a.k. mehta, m.k. ticku r brain research reõiews 29 (1999) 196–217

of these subunits are observed in the pentobarbital-tolerant
rats w320,321x. the expression of b 1 mrna is increased in
the hippocampal pyramidal cells of ca1 and ca2, but not
in hippocampal ca3–4 or cerebral cortex, following
chronic treatment of rats with pentobarbital w358x. chronic
treatment of primary cultured cerebellar granule cells with
pentobarbital decreased the gaba a receptor subunit
g 2l rg 2s mrna ratio but this effect is not mediated via
direct activation of the receptor itself w326x. neither the
mechanism nor the impact of decreasing the g 2l rg 2s
mrna ratio by pentobarbital is known, but changes in the
ratio could produce a decreased phosphorylation of the
gaba a receptor with subsequent alterations to gaba a
receptor function w326x.
6.5. ethanol
ethanol shares several pharmacological actions with the
benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and several of its effects
are mediated through gaba a receptors w1,166,200,
205,301,302,311,313x. on the other hand, gaba b receptors do not seem to be involved in the pharmacological
effects of ethanol w203x. it has been suggested that ethanol
sensitivity is correlated with the presence of bz i binding
sites žw3 hxzolpidem binding sites. w26,51,52x as well as
with the a 1-, b 2- and g 2-subunits of gaba a receptors
w51,71x. over the last decade, effects of chronic ethanol
administration and its abrupt withdrawal on the mrna
and polypeptide levels of gaba a receptor subunits have
been investigated in several brain regions in an attempt to
explain the mechanisms underlying its dependence and
tolerance. chronic ethanol administration is reported to
reduce the levels of a 1-, a 2-, a 5-subunit mrna and
polypeptide in cerebellum and cerebral cortex w29,41,
63,210,212,217,220x. however, chronic administration of
ethanol or its abrupt withdrawal following chronic administration did not result in the down-regulation of the
gaba a receptor assemblies containing a 1-subunit in both
the brain regions as determined by the w3 hxmuscimol,
w3 hxflunitrazepam, w3 hxro 15-4513 and w3 hxzolpidem
binding to the immunoprecipitated gaba a receptors using a 1-subunit-specific polyclonal antibody wmehta and
ticku, unpublished observationsx. in contrast to the decrease in the mrna and polypeptide levels of the a 1-subunit by chronic ethanol administration, the a 5-subunit
mrna levels are increased in the rat hippocampus w41x.
similarly, the a 4-, g 1-, g 2s- w65x, a 6- w212x and b 2r3-subunits w213x mrna levels increase in the  xxxd102xxx dependent
animals. furthermore, the polypeptide levels of the a 4-,
b 2r3-, and g1-subunits of gaba a receptors are also increased in the cerebral cortex of  xxxd102xxx dependent and
 xxxd102xxx withdrawn rats w63x. however, chronic administration of ethanol did not alter the mrna levels of g 2l -, g 3and d-subunits w65x as well as the polypeptide levels of
g 2-subunit w63x in cerebral cortex. during the behavioral
peak of ethanol withdrawal, mrna levels of the a 1-, a 4-,

205

and g 2s -subunits revert nearly to control levels, whereas
significant increase in the b 2-, b 3-, and g1-subunit mrna
levels are observed in the rat cerebral cortex w64x. chronic
intermittent ethanol žcie. treatment in rats leads to an
increase in the a 4-subunit mrna levels in hippocampus,
cerebral cortex and thalamus w183x. a new in vitro model
of cie using cultured cortical neurons has been developed
for studying the biochemical and molecular mechanisms
underlying the cie-induced kindling-like phenomenon observed in humans w134x. in the postmortem frontal cortex
of human alcoholics, the gaba a receptor a 1-, a 4-, and
b 2r3-subunit peptide expression did not differ as compared
to control group w215x. furthermore, no differences in
gaba a receptor a 1- or a 4-subunit mrna were found,
while higher levels of b 3-subunit mrna were found in
human alcoholics w215x. these results suggest that the
effects of chronic ethanol exposure in human alcoholics
differ from the rat model of  xxxd102xxx dependence.
chronic ethanol treatment increases the w3 hxro 15-4513
binding in the rat brain w208x and mouse cerebellum w14x,
and alters the behavioral effects of ro 15-4513 žsarmazenil.
w13,202x, a partial  xxxd1422xxx  of the benzodiazepine
site which is reported to antagonize the pharmacological
effects of low doses of ethanol mediated through gaba a
receptors w200,309,313x. the w3 hxmuscimol binding sites
are increased in the alcoholic human cerebral cortex w318x
and superior frontal gyrus of noncirrhotic alcoholics w67x.
there is a possibility that phosphorylation plays a role in
the biochemical events following chronic administration of
ethanol and its abrupt withdrawal w344x. selectively bred
mouse lines žss: short sleep; ls: long sleep. and rat lines
wat: alcohol-tolerant or alcohol-insensitive; ant:
alcohol-nontolerant or alcohol-sensitive; alcohol-preferring
rats and alcohol-nonpreferring ratsx have also implicated
the gaba a receptors in the action of ethanol w1,77,
299,329x. ethanol potentiates the gaba responses of certain brain regions in ls mice but not in ss mice, which is
consistent with the much longer  xxxd102xxx induced sleep
time in the ls mice w1x. on the other hand, the alcoholsensitive ant rats differ from the alcohol-insensitive at
rat lines by a critical point mutation of the a 6-subunit of
gaba a receptors žarg 100 residue is replaced by gln100 in
the ant rat line., thereby altering the normal diazepaminsensitive receptors into diazepam-sensitive ones w157x.
although the ant rats are more sensitive to the motor
impairment induced by ethanol w77x or benzodiazepines
w122x as compared to the at rats, there is no substantial
difference in the sensitivity to the hypnotic doses of ethanol
w76,161x. the ant rats exhibit a diminished stress-responses to a variety of stressors, even in the non-intoxicated state w323x. furthermore, ro 15-4513 has almost two
times more affinity for the ant rat cerebellum versus the
at rat cerebellum w329x. alcohol-preferring rats are reported to be more active in the open field w142,338x, and
are innately anxious as assessed by the less time spent on
the open arms as compared to alcohol-nonpreferring rats

206

a.k. mehta, m.k. ticku r brain research reõiews 29 (1999) 196–217

w299x. benzodiazepine receptor antagonists are reported to
modulate the behavioral actions of ethanol in the alcoholpreferring and -nonpreferring rats differentially w142x. alcohol-preferring fawn-hooded žfh. rats are reported to
possess a significantly higher density of w3 hxzolpidem
binding sites as compared to alcohol-nonpreferring
wistar-kyoto žwky. rats in brain regions involved in
reward processes such as cortical regions, substantia nigra
pars reticulata and the ventral pallidum w42x. selectively
bred rodent lines thus offer a very useful tool to investigate
the pharmacology of ethanol.
6.6. neurosteroids
several neurosteroids have been shown to interact with
the gaba a receptors w184,206,251x, as was first demonstrated for a synthetic neurosteroid anesthetic alphaxalone
w117x. these drugs interact with a distinct neurosteroid-binding site, different from the barbiturate-site, on gaba a
receptors w97,324x. furthermore, the presence of multiple
distinct steroid recognition sites or conformational states
on gaba a receptors has also been suggested w120,221x.
however, it has been suggested recently that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ždheas., a neurosteroid, binds
to the  xxxd2947xxx  site of gaba a receptors, whereas dehydroepiandrosterone ždhea. does not interact with gaba a
receptor complex w294x. neurosteroids, in general, interact
with the gaba a receptor assemblies composed of a 1-,
b 1-, and g 2-subunits or b 2-subunits alone w251x. modulation of the gaba response by steroids requires the presence of b-subunit, and does not depend on the presence of
a g-subunit unlike the benzodiazepine site w251x. however,
the substitution of a g 1-subunit for a g 2-subunit greatly
enhances the sensitivity to neuroactive steroids w250,252x.
on the other hand, d- and ´-subunits inhibit the neurosteroid modulation of gaba a receptors w57,368x, whereas
the type of a-subunit isoform does not seem to play a
major role in determining the neurosteroid efficacy or
potency as a positive modulator w250x. the a 4-subunit
suppression prevents withdrawal effects of progesterone
which include symptoms of premenstrual syndrome žpms.
such as anxiety and seizure susceptibility w292x. the pseudopregnancy paradigm has been suggested as a useful
model for periods of endogenous neurosteroid withdrawal
such as pms and postpartum or postmenopausal dysphoria
w293x which are associated with increased emotional liability and benzodiazepine-insensitivity w47,292,293x. chronic
neurosteroid treatment decreases the mrna levels of a 2-,
a 3-, b 2- and b 3-subunits w360x, and results in a heterologous uncoupling between the gaba, barbiturate, neurosteroid and benzodiazepine site w87,362x, and a reduced
efficacy of gaba, the benzodiazepine site ligands and
neurosteroids at the gaba a receptors in a heterologous
manner w361x. recently, neurosteroids are reported to be
more effective in inhibiting bicuculline-induced seizures in

the  xxxd102xxx withdrawn rats and in potentiating the gaba a
receptor-mediated chloride uptake in synaptosomes prepared from the cerebral cortex of  xxxd102xxx withdrawn rats
as compared to control group w64x. interestingly, the a 6containing recombinant receptors are more sensitive to the
inhibition of w35 sxtbps binding by 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20one than those containing the a 1-subunits w160x. 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one is a neurosteroid and a natural active
metabolite of progesterone which is also known as allopregnanolone or allopregnan-3a-ol-20-one or 3a-hydroxy5a-pregnan-20-one, and is almost equi-potent to benzodiazepines in potentiating the gaba a receptor-mediated
chloride ion flux w222x. it has hypnotic and anxiolytic
effects w50,125x which correlate with its efficacy on
gabaergic transmission in the cns, and potentiates the
binding of w3 hxflunitrazepam ža ligand for the benzodiazepine-site., and w3 hxmuscimol ža ligand for the gababinding site. in the rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum and
hippocampus w206x. 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one also elicited
a biphasic response, i.e., it potentiated the binding of
w35 sxtbps ža ligand for the  xxxd2947xxx -site. at lower concentrations and inhibited the binding at higher concentrations in the rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus w206x. furthermore, it is more efficacious in enhancing
the binding of w3 hxflunitrazepam and w3 hxmuscimol in the
cerebellum of  xxxd102xxx dependent rats as compared to control group w206x, and is more efficacious in inhibiting the
binding of w35 sxtbps in the hippocampus of  xxxd102xxx dependent and  xxxd102xxx withdrawn rats w206x, thereby suggesting that the neurosteroid binding site associated with
gaba a receptors plays an important role during ethanoldependence and  xxxd102xxx withdrawal w206x. however, 5apregnan-3a-ol-20-one has poor oral availability. to improve bioavailability, a new synthetic neuroactive steroid
ganaxolone ž3a-hydroxy-3b-methyl-5a-pregnan-20-one.
has been synthesized and is currently under clinical trials.
it is a potent and efficacious anticonvulsant agent for the
management of generalized absence and partial seizures
w35x as well as for convulsions due to cocaine poisoning
w96x. it is more potent and efficacious as compared to
valproate and diazepam in blocking the development of
pentylenetetrazole žptz.-kindled seizures w95x. recently, it
was reported that ganaxolone is superior to valproate,
 xxxd2056xxx , clonazepam, diazepam, and phenobarbital in
preventing the ptz-induced convulsions and the behavioral effects of ptz including its depressant effects on
locomotor activity and rearing in mice, thereby suggesting
that ganaxolone may provide additional benefits in the
treatment of epilepsy by controlling anxiety, mood changes
and other behavioral alterations associated with pre-seizure
activity w15x.
6.7. miscellaneous
the divalent cation zinc is reported to block the gaba a
receptor-mediated responses in a non-competitive and volt-

a.k. mehta, m.k. ticku r brain research reõiews 29 (1999) 196–217

age-dependent manner w68,86,130,163,168,289,290,356x.
receptor assemblies derived from a combination of a- and
b-subunits are highly sensitive to zinc-blockade but those
containing a g-subunit are almost resistant to blockade by
zinc w68,290x. in other words, gaba a receptors with a
benzodiazepine-site are resistant to blockade by zinc while
those devoid of the benzodiazepine-site are sensitive to
blockade by zinc in most instances. the extracellular
n-terminal domain of the a 1-subunit w86x, his 273 amino
acid residue of the a 6-subunit w86x, his 267 residue of the
b 1-subunit w130x, and his 292 aminoacid of the b 3-subunit
w356x are reported to be important determinants of the
zn2q binding site on the gaba a receptors. thyroid
hormones such as  xxxd2493xxx  žt3. and l-thyroxine
are also reported to interact with the gaba a receptors
w40,192x, and it has been suggested that the a 1-subunit
imparts t3 sensitivity to the gaba a receptors w40x. although  xxxg2205xxx , a biologically active tetradecapeptide, is known to mediate its biological actions through the
g protein-coupled membrane receptors w332x, its interaction with gaba a receptor complex has also been reported
w74,91,331x. chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs
such as clozapine and olanzapine is reported to decrease
the rat cortical and limbic gaba a receptors probably
in response to the increased gaba release following
the blockade of multiple neurotransmitter receptors on
gabaergic interneurons, and it has been suggested that
these antipsychotic drugs would assist in substantially
reversing an under-active gabaergic system in schizophrenia w79x. the pineal gland hormone melatonin
w45,170,187,227x, lanthanum w135,271x, g-butyrolactones
as well as g-thiobutyrolactones w124x, penicillin w131x,
antihelminthic compound ivermectin w165,244x, pesticide
compounds lindane, endrin and dieldrin w317x, anxiolyticr
anticonvulsant com pounds chlorm ethiazole and
trichloroethanol w113,218,235x, polyamines such as  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine w99x, and antidepressants such as
 xxxd160xxx  and  xxxd2637xxx  w295x have been reported to
interact with gaba a receptors but the exact site of action
of these drugs on the gaba a receptors and their subunits
requirement are not known currently.

7. concluding remarks
the heterogeneity of gaba a receptors in the brain is
much larger than originally thought. there is a large
number of different gaba a receptor subunits with distinct regional distribution. the pentameric gaba a receptor assembly can be derived from a permutation and
combination of two, three, four, or even five different
subunits. composition of various gaba a receptor assemblies can differ not only in different parts of the brain or in
different cells but also in the same cell. although the a 1-,
b 2r3-, and g 2-subunits co-exist in many native gaba a

207

receptors, the composition of major receptor assemblies in
various regions of brain has not been characterized fully.
radioligand binding to the immunoprecipitated receptors
using subunit-specific antibodies, co-localization studies
using immunoaffinity chromatography, immunocytochemistry, and the recombinant receptors system are useful tools
to provide this information in future. furthermore, characterization of molecular determinants of clinically important
drug-targets is under way. based on new information
available so far with these techniques, better anxiolytics
are being developed. these drugs are partial agonists for
gaba a receptor subtypes, and have fewer and less severe
side effects as compared to conventional benzodiazepine
anxiolytics. however, the progress in this area is hindered
by the fact that we still do not know the composition and
physiologicalrpharmacological significance of various native gaba a receptor assemblies. various experimental
approaches such as mutation, gene knockout and inhibition
of expression of gaba a receptor subunits by antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides are likely to provide answers to
some of these questions, and help us in developing newer
drugs devoid of major side effects associated with currently available anxiolytics as a result of their better
selectivity for various gaba a receptor assemblies.
