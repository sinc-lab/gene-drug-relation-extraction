abstract
the cholecystokinin ( xxxg353xxx ) agonist  xxxd2873xxx  stimulates dose-dependent release of  xxxg1801xxx 
(acth) and cortisol in humans, likely via direct pharmacological action at pituitary  xxxg353xxx  receptors.  xxxd2873xxx 
also produces side effects, however, which may be experienced as novel or anxiety arousing and could contribute to
acth release. available data suggest that  xxxd2873xxx ’s activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis
is unrelated to anxiety symptoms themselves, but novelty effects have not been examined in this model and do
strongly activate this system in animals. to further explore the impact of novelty and anxiety symptoms on hpa
responses,  xxxd2873xxx  was administered twice to 12 subjects (six male, six female) under single-blind conditions.
repeat  xxxd2873xxx  injection was associated with a slight habituation in the magnitude of symptom and hpa axis
responses, but robust hpa and symptom responses were seen following both injections. no relationships were found
between anxiety symptoms and hpa activity and the modest symptomatic and neuroendocrine habituation appeared
to occur independently.  xxxd2873xxx  may release acth and cortisol through direct pharmacological action, perhaps
enhanced on first exposure by psychologically mediated novelty effects. novelty, per se, is not likely the primary
mediator of the hpa response. this model may be useful for further study of cognitive-emotional modulators of
hpa axis activity.

1. introduction
cholecystokinin (cck) is a widely distributed
cns peptide thought to play a role in anxiety
(bradwejn and koszycki, 2001) and to modulate
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, a
principal neuroendocrine stress response system

(mezey et al., 1986; kamilaris et al., 1992; biró
et al., 1993). animal and human data show that
 xxxg353xxx  agonists produce anxiogenic effects and
hpa axis activation. in humans,  xxxg353xxx  agonists,
such as cck-4 or its synthetic analog  xxxd2873xxx ,
produce most of the classic symptoms of a panic
attack (bradwejn et al., 1990) as well as a dosedependent release of acth and cortisol (abelson
and liberzon, 1999). thus, evidence strongly suggests that  xxxg353xxx  stimulation triggers both anxiety
symptoms and a neuroendocrine stress response.

 xxxd2873xxx  may, therefore, be useful as a laboratory model of panic and as a tool for studying
modulatory control of the hpa axis. however, to
be useful as either, the relationship between these
two effects, and the mechanisms underlying the
hpa response, must be better understood. available data suggest the hpa response represents direct
pharmacological activation, unrelated to the intensity of anxious or panic symptoms produced
(abelson and liberzon, 1999). however, it
remains possible that it results from an indirect
activation, for instance, from psychosocial ‘stress’
associated with the subjective experience of receiving the drug, even if quantitatively unrelated to
the intensity of measured symptom responses.
many healthy subjects exposed to  xxxd2873xxx 
describe the experience as unique, novel and surprising, though they are not generally terribly
distressed by it. novelty is a known activator of
adrenocortical activity in animals (hennessy and
levine, 1979), an effect that is reduced with
repeated exposure to the same stressor. novelty
could play a role in the hpa axis response to
 xxxd2873xxx . if so, repeat exposure to the drug
should result in a diminished response. however,
if  xxxd2873xxx  activates hpa hormone release to
the same degree upon repeat injection, then the
novelty of the experience is probably not the
primary drive for its neuroendocrine effects. determining the stability of the hpa response to  xxxd2873xxx  is an important step in dissecting the
mechanism of cck-mediated stress system activation and in establishing the utility of this model
for further studies of the psychobiological modulation of hpa axis activity in humans.
2. methods
2.1. subjects
subjects were 12 healthy adults (mean ages
27.1"8.5 years, six male) recruited through newspaper advertising, screened using the structured
clinical interview for dsm-iv (scid) to ensure
absence of psychiatric disorders, and paid $100.
subjects were of normal weight, with low levels
of tobacco (-20 cigarettesyday) and alcohol
(-5 drinksyweek) use. they had no recent history

(past 6 months) of drug or alcohol abuse or
dependence. urine drug screens were negative and
blood tests (cell counts, electrolytes, glucose, liver
and renal function) were normal. females were
pre-menopausal, not using birth control pills, and
studied within the first 10 days after onset of
menstruation. all subjects provided written,
informed consent.
2.2. procedure
each subject was studied twice using identical
procedures. the two studies were 1 week apart in
males and 1 month apart in females (to insure
identical menstrual cycle phase). subjects were
told that they might receive placebo twice,  xxxd2873xxx  twice, or one of each in either order, so as
to preserve comparable expectancies at both visits.
they were admitted to a general clinical research
center at 13:00 h and an intravenous catheter was
placed in a forearm or antecubital vein by 13:30
h, kept open by a normal saline drip. subjects then
rested comfortably in bed for a 1.5-h accommodation period. baseline blood samples were
obtained at 15:00 and 15:28 h. at 15:30 h  xxxd2873xxx  (0.6 mgykg) was administered over a 10to 15-s period by the principal investigator (jla)
from behind a bed curtain, outside of subjects’
awareness. blood samples were subsequently
obtained at q3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min after
 xxxd2873xxx , drawn into vacutainer tubes containing heparin (cortisol sample) or edta (acth
sample) and immediately placed on ice. they were
spun (10 min at 3000 rev.ymin) in a refrigerated
centrifuge within 5 min, and plasma was immediately separated and stored at y70 8c.
anxious distress was measured using 100-mm
visual analog scales (vas, sum ratings of fear,
anxiety and nervousness minus rating of calm)
and assessed at y30, y5 min pre-, and q3, 5,
10 and 60 min post- xxxd2873xxx . physical symptoms of anxiety were measured on a panic attack
symptom scale (calculating the number of symptoms present and total symptom intensity) at y5
min pre-, and q3, 5, and 10 min post- xxxd2873xxx .
heart rate (hr), systolic blood pressure (sbp)
and diastolic blood pressure (dbp) were measured
using an airshields automated monitor. record-

ings were made every 10 min from 30 min before
to 10 min before  xxxd2873xxx  injection, and every
2 min from then until 10 min after injection.
cortisol was assayed using the direct, nonextraction coat-a-count tube assay from diagnostic products corporation (los angeles, ca), and
acth was assayed using the allegro hs irma
from nichols institute (san juan capistrano, ca).
sensitivities were 6 pgyml for acth and 0.2
mgydl for cortisol, with coefficients of variation
of less than 10%.
2.3. analyses
primary analyses involved a two-factor
(time=run) repeated measures analysis of variance (rm-anova) on symptom, cardiovascular,
and log-transformed endocrine data. the impact
of  xxxd2873xxx  is seen in the main effect of time
(within run). the impact of the repeat infusion is
seen in the main effect of run (run 2 vs. run 1)
and the time=run interaction. effects of  xxxd2873xxx  on hormone levels at both injections were
also analyzed using two additional measures: peak
response and area under the curve (auc)
response. peak response reflects the immediate
impact of  xxxd2873xxx  on the magnitude of hpa
response (subtracting mean baseline from postpentagastrin maximum), while auc response is a
more integrated measure of total secretory effect
(subtracting time-corrected area under pre-injection curve from total area under post-injection
curve) (abelson and liberzon, 1999). using
paired t-tests, we then compared both endocrine
and symptom responses between run 1 and run
2. we also compared post- xxxd2873xxx  symptom
and hormone levels to pre-injection levels within
each run to determine whether significant  xxxd2873xxx  effects were detectable on both exposures
to the drug. finally, interrelationships between the
variables were explored using pearson productmoment correlations.
3. results
a significant effect of time was observed for
acth (f6,66s26.3, p-0.001), cortisol (f6,66s
30.39, p-0.001), anxious distress (f5,55s51.1,

p-0.001), total panic symptom intensity (f3,33s
44.7, p-0.001), as well as all three measures of
the cardiovascular response (p-0.001), indicating
a significant elevation on all measures following
 xxxd2873xxx  injection. a significant effect of run
was observed for intensity of panic symptoms
(ps0.036), but not for acth (ps0.728), cortisol (ps0.163) or subjective anxiety (ps0.498).
a significant time=run interaction was observed
for measures of cortisol (f6,66s3.81, ps0.003),
anxious distress (f5,55s2.38, ps0.05) and panic
symptom intensity (f3,33s5.98, ps0.002), but
not for acth (f6,66s1.224, ps0.305).
inspection of graphs (see figs. 1 and 2) indicates that the impact of repeat injection was a very
small reduction in response, more notably for
cortisol and symptoms than acth. on all variables the reduction in response was quite small,
relative to the magnitude of the  xxxd2873xxx 
response seen on both exposures. the rise from
baseline to post- xxxd2873xxx  peak remained signif-

response changes from run 1 to run 2 (see fig.
3) showed that the majority of subjects were fairly
normally distributed around zero (modal response
was no change), with only three subjects showing
a greater than 4 mgydl reduction in cortisol
response on run 2 relative to run 1. in contrast,
the histogram of anxious distress response change
from run 1 to run 2 (see fig. 3) showed a fairly
normal distribution around y40 (modal response
was reduced anxiety; 10 of 12 subjects showed
reductions). the three subjects with greater than 4
mgydl cortisol reductions all had peak cortisol
responses on run 1 that were above the group
mean. larger cortisol response at run 1 predicted
a greater decline in response from run 1 to run
2 (rs0.61, p-0.04). when cortisol response on

icant during the second injection for acth (t1,11s
y4.31, ps0.001), cortisol (t1,11sy4.02, ps
0.002), anxious distress (t1,11sy8.92, ps0.001)
and panic intensity (t1,11sy7.43, p-0.001). a
significant  xxxd2873xxx  effect on second exposure
was also preserved for both hormones using auc
measures (t1,11s2.386, ps0.0361 and t1,11s
3.829, ps0.0028, for acth and cortisol,
respectively).
the magnitude of the maximum rise in acth
from baseline to peak did not differ significantly
between first and second exposure (t1,11s1.54,
ps0.15). for cortisol, the effect of repetition on
this measure approached but did not reach significance (t1,11s1.99, ps0.073). in contrast, using
the auc response measure, repeat exposure was
associated with significantly reduced responses for
both acth (t1,11s2.37, ps0.037) and cortisol
(t1,11s2.21, ps0.049). though the responseattenuating impact of repeat injection appears to
have been greater for cortisol than for acth (see
fig. 1), examination of histograms of cortisol-

run 1 was entered as a covariate in the rmanova on run 1 and run 2 cortisol data, the
time=run interaction was no longer significant
(f6,60s1.19, ps0.326). there was no relationship
between magnitude of decline in anxiety response
from run 1 to run 2 and magnitude of decline in
cortisol response (rs0.22, ps0.49).
no response reductions were seen from first to
second exposure on cardiovascular measures (hr,
sbp, dbp, data not shown). finally, no significant
correlations were found between the acth and
cortisol response to  xxxd2873xxx  and measures of
anxious distress or panic symptom intensity.
4. discussion
the data show a small reduction in magnitude
of symptom and hpa axis responses to  xxxd2873xxx  with repeat exposure to the drug, but they also
show substantial response preservation on all
measures, in healthy subjects. preservation of
symptom response following repeat infusion of
cck-4 has previously been demonstrated in panic
patients, although neuroendocrine changes were
not examined (bradwejn et al., 1992). in the
current study, acth and cortisol responses to
 xxxd2873xxx  appear to be fairly stable in most
individuals when injections are repeated a week or
a month later. in this study, some individuals with
above average initial responses showed reduced
cortisol responses with repeat injection. in contrast,
almost all subjects showed small reductions in
anxiety symptom responses. as in previous work
(abelson and liberzon, 1999; abelson and young,
2003), no relationships could be found between
anxiety symptoms and hpa responses. nor was a
correlation found between changes in anxiety
response and changes in neuroendocrine response
from run 1 to run 2, suggesting that habituation
of these two processes occurred independently. no
reductions in cardiovascular responses were seen.
if novelty stress associated with first exposure to
 xxxd2873xxx ’s side effects played a dominant role
in the neuroendocrine and physiological effects
produced, there should have been a clear loss of
these effects upon second exposure. the lack of
such clear habituation, despite slight but consistent
symptom reduction, makes it highly unlikely that

193

the hpa or cardiovascular responses to  xxxd2873xxx  are primarily driven by the symptoms produced or by their novelty.
though the data indicate relative stability of the
hpa response to  xxxd2873xxx  over time and suggest that  xxxd2873xxx  remains a potent trigger of
both hpa and symptom responses even after
subjects are familiar with its subjective effects,
they also demonstrate that some habituation does
occur in both symptom and hormonal responses.
the reductions seen could represent lower level
habituation such that visceral sensory inputs
through the brain stem that are novel are rapidly
transmitted to higher centers for emotional and
cognitive processing, which triggers an hpa
response and intensifies awareness of the symptoms; but when the sensation pattern is no longer
novel, it may not be transmitted onward for further
processing. however, the data do not support the
hypothesis that the hpa response is primarily
secondary to the emotional processing of visceral
sensory side effects. in addition, there is evidence
that  xxxd2873xxx  stimulates acth release through
a direct pharmacological effect at the level of the
pituitary (abelson and young, 2003). in this context, the slight habituation seen in the current study
suggests a more complex model in which higher
level cns processing of experiential and contextual cues may impact background neuralyneuroendocrine traffic to the pituitary andyor adrenal in a
way that can modulate a direct pharmacological
activation. novelty may provide one such modulatory, experiential cue. our data suggest that such
modulation may be more evident in total secretory
response (auc) than peak response, as the auc
measure appeared more sensitive to habituation.
if this model is correct, the data also suggest
that there may be individual differences in sensitivity to such experientialycontextual cues. there
may also be interesting diagnostic group differences in such sensitivities. we have previously demonstrated that panic patients show exaggerated
hpa responses to  xxxd2873xxx  when it is given
during a first visit to a laboratory, but their
responses are normal when it is given after a prior
visit to the laboratory for a placebo injection
(abelson et al., 1994). we interpreted those findings as suggesting that the hpa axis in panic

194

s. khan et al. / psychiatry research 126 (2004) 189–195

patients may be more reactive than healthy controls
to the novelty of the experimental situation and
this novelty sensitivity augmented their hpa
response to  xxxd2873xxx  during a first visit. the
current data are consistent with the idea that
novelty can augment the hpa response to  xxxd2873xxx , even in some healthy controls, and that
individuals may differ in sensitivity to this effect.
although a second infusion did not eliminate
the hpa response to  xxxd2873xxx  in the current
study, it is possible that with additional repetitions
a significant decrement in hpa response would be
observed. if so, potential mechanisms could
include receptor changes at the level of the pituitary, habituation occurring at or below the level of
the limbic system within the brain, or altered
processing through cortical-limbic circuits that
attach meaning and emotional valence to sensory
cues. if further work reveals a decrease in hpa
response with multiple repeat injections, follow-up
work to dissect pathways and mechanisms could
be informative.
further work is needed to substantiate our speculative interpretations of these data, but the ideas
proposed suggest that  xxxd2873xxx  may offer a
useful model for more detailed study of experientialycontextual modulators of the hpa axis in
humans. there has, in fact, been relatively little
effort in human studies to replicate animal data
that demonstrate a reliable impact of specific
psychosocial cues on hpa axis activity. novelty
is one such cue (hennessy and levine, 1979;
levine, 2000). the present data showed relative
preservation of the hpa response to  xxxd2873xxx 
with repeat exposure, suggesting little novelty
effect, but also provided some support of subtle
novelty effects, more evident in some measures
than others and perhaps in some individuals.
degree of control over a stressor and its predictability are additional relevant and possibly more
important factors (hennessy and levine, 1979;
dess et al., 1983; herrmann et al., 1984; sandi et
al., 1992). the importance of control on the hpa
response to a stressor has been confirmed in
humans in one older report (breier et al., 1987)
using a yoked-control design, but this study has
itself never been replicated. koszycki et al. (1998)
demonstrated that fear of a loss of control is a

significant factor contributing to individual differences in symptom responses to a cck agonist.
sense of control was not measured or manipulated
in the current study, so its impact on neuroendocrine changes cannot be assessed, but attention to
this and other as yet unmeasured emotional and
symptom responses will be needed in future studies
to determine whether there are specific subjective
experiences that correspond to fluctuations in hpa
axis activity in this kind of paradigm. it may be
fruitful in such work to use a lower dose of
 xxxd2873xxx , since the influence of psychological
modulators may be more evident with a less robust
pharmacological activation.
if the hpa response to  xxxd2873xxx  represents
a direct pharmacological effect, which can be
modulated by cognitiveyemotional ‘background
traffic’ in the system, it may provide a useful
laboratory tool for examining modulators of the
hpa axis in human populations. manipulation of
novelty, for example, can be used in the model to
study individual and diagnostic group differences
in sensitivity to this experiential cue. control,
predictability, and cognitive expectancies can also
be manipulated in this model to determine their
ability to modulate hpa axis activity in humans.
by utilizing other neuroendocrine and neuroimaging techniques within this model, the brain mechanisms mediating these effects can be dissected.
this model could also be combined with a sleep
administration paradigm (kronenberg et al., 2001;
geraci et al., 2002) to further dissect the role of
baseline arousal, pre-infusion anxiety, and cognitive appraisal and expectancies on both neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. we thus may
have a useful model for studying corticalylimbic
interactions in stress-response modulation.
