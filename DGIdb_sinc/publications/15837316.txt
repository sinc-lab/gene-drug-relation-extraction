abstract—the antiepileptic drug  xxxd3564xxx  was considered to act as a weak inhibitor of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca,
 xxxg287xxx   xxxg293xxx   xxxg296xxx   xxxg297xxx ) (with a ki of 4.3 lm against the cytosolic isozyme ii). here we prove that this is not true. indeed, testing  xxxd3564xxx  in
the classical assay conditions of the co2 hydrase activity of hca ii, with incubation times of enzyme and inhibitor solution of
15 min, a ki of 10.3 lm has been obtained. however, when the incubation between enzyme and inhibitor was prolonged to 1 h,
the obtained ki was of 35.2 nm, of the same order of magnitude as that of the clinically used sulfonamides/sulfamates acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx  and topiramate (kis in the range of 5.4–15.4 nm). the inhibition of the human mitochondrial
isozyme hca v with these compounds has been also tested by means of a  xxxd550xxx  competition binding assay, which showed
 xxxd3564xxx  and topiramate to be eﬀective inhibitors, with kis in the range of 20.6–25.4 nm. the x-ray crystal structure of the
adduct of hca ii with  xxxd3564xxx  has also been solved at a resolution of 1.70 å, showing that the sulfonamide moiety participates
in the classical interactions with the zn(ii) ion and the residues thr199 and glu106, whereas the benzisoxazole ring is oriented
toward the hydrophobic half of the active site, establishing a large number of strong van der waals interactions (<4.5 å) with residues gln92, val121, phe131, leu198, thr200, pro202.

1. introduction
 xxxd3564xxx  ( xxxd3564xxx ), is a widely used antiepileptic drug.1,2 in vitro
studies with cultured neurons showed that  xxxd3564xxx 
blocks repetitive ﬁring of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive t-type calcium currents without aﬀecting l-type calcium currents.1,2 such
a complicated mechanism of action may explain its eﬃcacy in patients resistant to other antiepileptic drugs,
whereas its pharmacokinetic proﬁle is favorable for clinical use since the drug is rapidly and completely ab-

sorbed and has a long half-life (63–69 h), which allows
twice- or once-daily dosing.1,2 being an unsubstituted
sulfonamide,  xxxd3564xxx  has also been investigated for
the inhibition of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase
(ca,  xxxg287xxx   xxxg293xxx   xxxg296xxx   xxxg297xxx ) by its discoverers,3,4 being concluded
that although it binds signiﬁcantly to erythrocytes5
(where two ca isozymes, ca i and ii are highly abundant)6,7 its ca inhibitory properties are rather weak,
and thus, this phenomenon does not play any role in
the anticonvulsant activity of the drug.1–4 indeed, most
inhibitors of cas belong to the sulfonamide or sulfamate class of compounds,6–10 with several derivatives
such as acetazolamide aza,  xxxd2592xxx  mza,
 xxxd2058xxx  eza, or topiramate tpm being clinically used for the treatment or prevention of a variety
of disorders such as glaucoma, acid–base disequilibria,
epilepsy, and other minor neuromuscular disorders, or

as diuretics, etc., whereas many other compounds are in
clinical investigation as antiobesity or anticancer
drugs.11–15

thus, although masuda and karasawa3 reported that
zns is a weak inhibitor of the major red cell isozyme
hca ii, with an inhibition constant of 4.3 lm, some
of the side eﬀects of this drug, such as kidney stones,16
oligohydrosis, and fever,17,18 as well as the fact that it
has been reported that the drug is highly bound to erythrocytes,5 are typical of a potent ca inhibitor.8 furthermore, a recent patent19 claimed that  xxxd3564xxx  is
eﬀective for reducing weight in obese subjects and for
treating eating disorders, such as binge-eating disorder,
bulimia nervosa, or anorexia nervosa.  xxxd3564xxx  has
been employed in a clinical study conducted in 60 subjects to evaluate the short-term eﬃcacy and safety in
the treatment of obesity.19 the group treated with
zns lost on average, more bodyweight than the placebo
group (5.98% vs 1.09%) during the 16-week period of the
study and 17/30 subjects in the treated group and 3/30 in
the vehicle group were observed to have lost greater
than 5% weight. zns is thus similar to topiramate
tpm, another antiepileptic drug showing potent antiobesity eﬀects,20,21 which have been explained recently
by us as due to inhibition of the ca isozymes involved
in lipogenesis, that is, hca ii and v.11,22,23 indeed, in
a previous study we showed by means of solution and
x-ray crystallographic studies that tpm is a low nanomolar inhibitor of hca ii, appreciably inhibiting other
physiologically relevant ca isozymes too.12,22 these
were some of the reasons that prompted us to (re)investigate the interaction of  xxxd3564xxx  with hca ii and
hca v, the two isozymes involved in lipogenesis
and other metabolic processes, by means of solution
and x-ray crystallographic studies.
2. chemistry and ca inhibition
the clinically used compounds zns–tpm and  xxxd550xxx  are commercially available (from dainippon,
sigma-aldrich or johnson & johnson) and were used
without further puriﬁcation. human recombinant isozymes hca ii and v have been obtained in our laboratory as reported earlier.23

two assay methods24,25 have been employed here for
determining the inhibition constants of the above mentioned compounds against hca ii and hca v: a
stopped-ﬂow assay for the co2 hydration activity of
hca ii,24 and a  xxxd550xxx  competition binding assay
for hca v.25 as far as we know, this is the ﬁrst report of
assaying ca v inhibitors with this method, which has
generally been used for measuring the inhibition of
hca ii and some of its mutants.25 as seen from data
of table 1, in contrast with that reported earlier,3
zns is an eﬀective hca ii inhibitor, possessing an inhibition constant of 35.2 nm, of the same order of magnitude as the other clinically used derivatives aza, mza,
eza, or tpm; which were slightly more eﬀective inhibitors (kis in the range of 5.4–15.4 nm). however, an
important diﬀerence has been observed between zns
and all the other ca inhibitors investigated here. thus,
in the classical inhibition assay using the co2 hydrase
activity of diverse ca isozymes developed by khalifah,24 enzyme and inhibitor solutions are incubated
for a standard period of time, which is of 15 min. in
the case of zns, such a standard incubation time led
to a weak inhibition, with a measured ki of 10.3 lm,
which is comparable to that reported by masuda and
karasawa (4.3 lm) who concluded that this compound
behaves as a weak ca ii inhibitor.3 we have performed
thereafter inhibition assay after longer incubation periods of the enzyme and inhibitor solutions (of 30–
60 min) and observed that the measured ki decreased
constantly till reaching a plateau after 60 min incubation
period (data not shown). at the end of that period a
constant ki with the value reported in table 1 has been
obtained, proving that zns is a much more eﬀective
hca ii inhibitor as originally reported.3 this phenomenon is on the other hand not observed with the other
sulfonamides/sulfamates investigated up to now. presumably, zns shows a very slow rate of association
with the enzyme active site, unlike the other sulfonamides/sulfamates investigated here. in fact such association/dissociation rates have been investigated kinetically by maren, who showed that the rate of
association of inhibitors (kon) with the active site of
hca ii may vary between 3.103 and 3.107 l m1 s1,
whereas the dissociation rate of the e–i complex (koﬀ)
is generally of the same order of magnitude for very

g. de simone et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 15 (2005) 2315–2320

diverse classes of sulfonamides.26 this may explain the
very diﬀerent inhibition constants reported earlier for
zns,3 as compared to our data, and also may explain
the side eﬀects of this antiepileptic, some of which are
typical of strong ca inhibitors, such as acetazolamide,
 xxxd2592xxx , or topiramate (for this last compound
the same type of side eﬀects, that is, kidney stones,16,27
oligohydrosis,18,28 or metabolic acidosis,29 have been
reported in rare cases).21,30 however, side eﬀects of a
drug may sometimes lead to novel applications, as for
the antiobesity actions of topiramate20,21 and  xxxd3564xxx ,19 which we hypothesize to be at least partly due
to inhibition of the ca isozymes involved in lipogenesis,
that is, hca ii and v.11 in order to check this hypothesis, we tested the hca v inhibitory activity of these
derivatives (and other standard, clinically used compounds such as aza, mza, and eza) against the
recombinant full length mitochondrial isozyme hca v
(table 1). in order to avoid the kinetic eﬀects observed
with the co2 hydrase method discussed above, we selected the  xxxd550xxx  competition binding assay,25
for which longer incubation times are employed, that
is, around 1 h, which presumably assures the right equilibration between the enzyme and the inhibitor in the e–i
complex. indeed, data of table 1 show that aza, mza,
and eza are very potent hca v inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range (of 1.8–
2.5 nm) whereas  xxxd3564xxx  and topiramate are slightly
less potent, but anyhow, very eﬀective inhibitors, with
kis in the range of 20.6–25.4 nm.

3. x-ray crystallography
to assess the molecular basis responsible for the high
aﬃnity of zns toward hca ii, we solved the crystal
structure of the hca ii–zns complex, which was prepared and crystallized using experimental conditions
previously reported for other sulfonamide/sulfamate
ca inhibitors.31–36 the three-dimensional structure
was analyzed by diﬀerence fourier techniques, the crystals being isomorphous to those of the native enzyme37
and reﬁned using the cns program.38 the statistics
for data collection and reﬁnement are summarized in
table 2.39
inspection of the electron density in the enzyme active
site, at various stages of the crystallographic reﬁnement,
showed features compatible with the presence of one
inhibitor molecule bound within the active site (fig.
1). the  xxxd3564xxx  structure conformed perfectly to
the shape of this electron density (fig. 2). the binding
of the inhibitor to the enzyme active site did not signiﬁcantly perturb the enzyme structure, even in the close
proximity of the ligand. as a matter of fact, a r.m.s.
deviation value of 0.33 å, over the entire ca atoms
of hca ii- xxxd3564xxx  complex with respect to the
unbound enzyme, was calculated. similarly, interactions
between the protein and zn(ii) ion were entirely preserved in the complex.
several polar and hydrophobic interactions stabilized
the inhibitor within the hca ii active site, as clearly

illustrated in figure 3. according to this ﬁgure, the
inhibitor molecule shows a spatial arrangement similar
to that observed in other hca ii-sulfonamide/sulfamate
complexes for which the x-ray structure has been

solved.31–36 in particular, the inhibitor molecule has the
n1 atom of the sulfamoyl moiety coordinated in tetrahedral geometry to the zn(ii) ion of the enzyme active
site (n1–zn(ii) = 1.99 å). the zn(ii) ion is also coordinated to the imidazole groups of three histidine residues
(his94, his96, and his119), as in the uninhibited enzyme.37 the n1 atom of the inhibitor is also hydrogen
bonded to the hydroxyl group of thr199 (n1–throg =
2.59 å), which in turn interacts with the glu106oe1
atom (2.58 å), these interactions being observed in all
adducts of sulfonamides/sulfamates with various ca
isozymes.31–36 furthermore, the inhibitor o1 atom is
hydrogen bonded to the backbone amide of thr199
(thrn–o1 = 2.76 å), whereas the o2 atom was at a
distance of 3.06 å from the catalytic zn(ii) ion. the
benzisoxazole ring of  xxxd3564xxx  was oriented toward
the hydrophobic part of the active site cleft (figs. 1
and 3), establishing a large number of strong van der
waals interactions (<4.5 å) with residues gln92,
val121, phe131, leu198, thr200, pro202, respectively.
these amino acids have been already reported to establish important interactions with the organic scaﬀold of
other ca inhibitors,31–36 critically contributing to stabilize the inhibitor within the active site cleft. it is important to highlight that although the organic scaﬀold of

 xxxd3564xxx  does not establish signiﬁcant polar interactions with the enzyme, as otherwise observed for some
other hca ii-sulfonamide/sulfamate complexes,31,32
the large number of hydrophobic contacts mentioned
above between the inhibitor and the enzyme can account
for the good inhibitory properties of this molecule.
4. conclusions
although the literature data presented the antiepileptic
drug  xxxd3564xxx  as a weak hca ii inhibitor (with a
ki of 4.3 lm), we prove here that this needs to be revised. indeed, testing the compound in the classical assay conditions of the co2 hydrase activity (i.e., with
incubation times of enzyme and inhibitor solution of
15 min) a ki of 10.3 lm has been obtained. however,
when the incubation between enzyme and inhibitor
was prolonged to 1 h, the obtained ki was of 35.2 nm,
of the same order of magnitude as that of the clinically
used sulfonamides/sulfamates acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx , and topiramate (kis in the range
of 5.4–15.4 nm). the inhibition of the mitochondrial
isozyme hca v with these compounds has been also
tested by means of a  xxxd550xxx  competition binding

g. de simone et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 15 (2005) 2315–2320

assay, which showed  xxxd3564xxx  and topiramate to be
eﬀective inhibitors, with kis in the range of 20.6–
25.4 nm. the x-ray crystal structure of the adduct of
hca ii with  xxxd3564xxx  has also been solved at a resolution of 1.70 å, showing that the sulfonamide moiety
participates in the classical interactions with the zn(ii)
ion and the residues thr199 and glu106, whereas the
benzisoxazole ring is situated in the hydrophobic half
of the active site, establishing a large number of strong
van der waals interactions (<4.5 å) with residues
gln92, val121, phe131, leu198, thr200, pro202. on
the basis of these results we suggest that  xxxd3564xxx ,
similarly with topiramate may be used as the lead molecule for the design and further exploration of subtype
selective ca inhibitors.

39. crystals of the hca ii–zns complex were obtained by
cocrystallization as previously described. data collection
was carried out on a single crystal which was ﬂash-frozen
at 100 k, using cu-ka radiation from a rotating anode xray generator coupled with a smart 1k ccd detector
from bruker. the crystal diﬀracted up to 1.70 å resolution. diﬀracted intensities were processed using the saint
program.40 crystal data and data-collection statistics are
given in table 2. the structure of the hca ii–zns
complex was analyzed by diﬀerence fourier techniques,
using the pdb ﬁle 1ca237 as a starting model for
reﬁnement. water molecules were removed from the
starting model prior to structure factor and phase calculations. fourier maps calculated with 3fo2fc and fofc
coeﬃcients showed prominent electron density features in
the active site region. after an initial reﬁnement, limited to
the enzyme structure (r-factor 0.281 and r-free 0.320), a
model for the inhibitor was easily built and introduced

into the atomic coordinates set for further reﬁnement,
which proceeded to convergence with continuous map
inspection and model updates. final crystallographic rfactor and r-free values calculated for the 23,166 observed
reﬂection (in the 20.00–1.70 å resolution range) were
0.188 and 0.220, respectively. the reﬁned model included
2,074 complex atoms, 14 atoms belonging to the inhibitor,
and 306 water molecules. the r.m.s. deviations from the
ideal value of bond lengths and bond angles41 were
0.005 å and 1.80°, respectively. the average temperature
factor (b) for all atoms was 12.66 å2. the stereochemical

quality of the model was assessed by procheck.42 the
statistics for reﬁnement are summarized in table 2. the
coordinates of the hca ii–zns adduct are available
