abstract
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cscc) are a common
malignancy of keratinocytes that arise in sites of the skin
exposed to excessive uv radiation. in the present study, we
show that human scc cell lines, preneoplastic solar keratoses
(sk), and cscc are associated with perturbations in glutathione peroxidase (gpx) activity and peroxide levels. specifically,
we found that two of three sks and four of five csccs, in vivo,
were associated with decreased gpx activity and all sks and
csccs were associated with an elevated peroxide burden.
given the association of decreased gpx activity with cscc,
we examined the basis for the gpx deficiency in the csccs.
our data indicated that gpx was inactivated by a posttranslational mechanism and that gpx could be inactivated
by increases in intracellular peroxide levels. we next tested
whether the decreased peroxidase activity coupled with an
elevated peroxidative burden might contribute to cscc
formation in vivo. this was tested in  xxxg943xxx  / and  xxxg944xxx  /
mice exposed to solar-simulated uv radiation. these studies
showed that  xxxg944xxx  deficiency predisposed mice to uv-induced
cscc formation. these results suggest that inactivation of
 xxxg944xxx  in human skin may be an early event in uv-induced scc
formation. [cancer res 2007;67(10):4751–8]

introduction
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cscc) is a common and
sometimes fatal malignancy arising from transformed keratinocytes of the epidermis. although excessive exposure to uva/uvb
irradiation is considered to be the main etiologic factor in the
development of cscc, there is mounting evidence that infection
with human papillomavirus subtypes as well as immunoincompetence may also contribute to cscc development (e.g., see refs. 1, 2).
in spite of our knowledge of the main causative factors associated
with cscc development, as well as a growing knowledge of the
molecular defects associated with csccs, we still have little
understanding of how the etiologic factors initiate the transforming
events in keratinocytes. in an attempt to understand the molecular
basis for the initiation of cscc, we did a gene array study
comparing normal keratinocytes with cells derived from an early

scc (intraepidermal carcinoma; ref. 3) and a late-stage scc (3).
in that study, we reported that the most significant and early
observable alteration in gene expression was a 10- to 40-fold
induction in the mrna for  xxxg944xxx  ( xxxg944xxx ; ref. 3).
this profound and early induction of  xxxg944xxx  mrna in sccs
suggested that gpx, and by extrapolation aberrant peroxide
metabolism, may be involved in the early events that contribute
to the development of scc in vivo.
the gpxs ( xxxg943xxx ,  xxxg944xxx ,  xxxg945xxx , and  xxxg946xxx ) are a family of
peroxidases that use  xxxd2213xxx  (gsh) as an electron
donor and catalyze the biotransformation of various organic and
inorganic peroxides (4).  xxxg943xxx ,  xxxg944xxx ,  xxxg945xxx , and  xxxg946xxx  are all
selenocysteine-containing proteins (4).  xxxg943xxx  is a ubiquitous
intracellular gpx and is the most predominant of the gpx
isoforms (4).  xxxg943xxx  can catalyze the removal of inorganic peroxides
and lipid peroxides (4).  xxxg944xxx  is reported to be localized
predominantly to the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract (5)
and has similar substrate specificities to that of  xxxg943xxx  (4).  xxxg945xxx  is a
secreted form of gpx and is able to reduce lipid hydroperoxides
(6, 7).  xxxg946xxx  is an intracellular peroxidase that preferentially
catalyses the peroxidation of phospholipid hydroperoxides (8, 9).
when cells are exposed to stressful or damaging stimuli, they
generate reactive oxygen species (ros) in response to the stress
signals (10–12). although ros are inherently reactive and
damaging, the cells have a suite of cytoprotective enzymes,
including gpxs, superoxide dismutases, and catalase, to convert
ros into harmless products (4). defects in these antioxidant
enzymes, which can reduce ros levels and the subsequent
accumulation of ros, including peroxides, may contribute to
cancer formation by facilitating macromolecular damage, such as
dna lesions, or stimulating proliferation (13, 14). in this regard,
gpx enzymes would be considered to be tumor preventive.
however, the ability of the gpx enzymes to reduce intracellular
peroxides would also suggest that it could act as a procarcinogen
by inhibiting the ability of a cell to undergo peroxide-stimulated
apoptosis in response to stressful stimuli (15–17). this is not
unprecedented because  xxxg943xxx  (16) and  xxxg944xxx  (17) have both been
reported to inhibit stress-induced apoptosis. this potential
procarcinogenic activity could explain the enhanced skin tumor
incidence in transgenic mice that overexpress  xxxg943xxx  (18). although
this apparent paradox (procarcinogen versus tumor preventive)
remains unresolved, there are a large number of reports to suggest
that the main function of gpx is that of an antioxidant and tumor
preventative. for example, (a)  xxxg943xxx / xxxg944xxx  double knockout (dko)
mice have an enhanced rate of inflammation-induced intestinal
cancer (5); (b) human lung and breast cancers frequently contain a

the metabolism of known carcinogens; (e) peroxides are precursors

the highly reactive hydroxyl radical following uv exposure is a
direct consequence of increased peroxide levels (22); (g ) certain
organic peroxides (e.g., benzoyl peroxide and tert-butylhydroperoxide) are known tumor promoters (14); and (h) peroxides inhibit
the egfrec phosphatase resulting in constitutive egfrec phosphorylation and activation of this pro-proliferative signaling pathway
(13). these data would support the hypothesis that gpx enzymes
are tumor protective. however, data implicating disturbed peroxide
metabolism with human cancers have not been reported to date.
in the present study, we examine the regulation and expression
of gpx isoforms in human skin and examine whether inactivation
of gpx activity may be a contributory factor in the development of
uv-induced cscc.

tissue culture. normal human keratinocytes (heks) were isolated and
cultured from neonatal foreskins following circumcision as described (23–
25). the maintenance and culture of the epidermal scc cell line colo-16
and the tongue-derived scc cell line scc25 have also been described
previously (26, 27). due to a deficiency of selenium in the culture medium,
the scc25 and colo-16 cells were grown in medium supplemented with
50 nmol/l sodium selenite (28). in some instances, cells were treated with
tert-butylhydroperoxide (700 amol/l final concentration), h2o2 (500 amol/l
final concentration), the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole (5 mmol/l final
concentration; ref. 29), the peroxidase mimetic ebselen (100 amol/l final
concentration; ref. 30), and the antioxidant dl- xxxd3521xxx  ( xxxd3521xxx ;
1 mmol/l final concentration; ref. 22).
rna isolation and real-time pcr. total rna was isolated using trizol
reagent (27) and single-strand cdna was synthesized (3). real-time pcr
used platinum sybr green qpcr supermix  xxxg2389xxx  (invitrogen), reactions
were amplified on a rotor-gene real-time pcr machine, and the data were
analyzed using the rotor-gene (version 6) software (corbett). the following
primers were used:  xxxg943xxx , acgatgttgcctggaacttt ( forward) and
tcgatgtcaatggtctggaa (reverse);  xxxg944xxx  , taagtgggctcaggcctctct ( forward) and ggtcatagaaggacttggcaatg
(reverse);  xxxg945xxx  , acaggaagagcttgcaccat ( for ward) and
ctcctggttcctgttttcca (reverse);  xxxg946xxx  , cagtgaggcaagaccgaagt ( forward) and ctgcttcccgaagtggttac (reverse); and actin,
ggacctgactgactacctca ( forward) and agcttctccttaatgtcacg
(reverse). pcr amplifications were done under the following conditions:
denaturation at 94jc for 5 s, annealing at 55jc for 10 s, and extension at
72jc for 15 s.
tissue collection. in the mouse studies, epidermal sheets were isolated
from wild-type (wt) or  xxxg943xxx  / / xxxg944xxx  / dko mice (5) as described
(23–25). for human tumor studies, resected tumors were taken from
patients (with consent) and the classification of the lesions [i.e., solar
keratoses (sk) or scc] was made by the staff pathologist. the epithelial
sheets were removed (23, 27), and gpx activity assays (bioxytech gpx-340,
 xxxd2155xxx  international), western blots, and real-time pcr were done.
antibody production and western blotting. isoform-specific rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against the cooh-terminal peptides of human  xxxg943xxx 
(iepdieallsqg) and human  xxxg944xxx  (cdikrllkvai) were generated.
peptides were synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin
(auspep). rabbit polyclonal antisera were then generated (institute of
medical and veterinary sciences, adelaide, south australia, australia) and
tested for cross-reactivity against purified  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  peptide (data not
shown). antisera were frozen down in aliquots and used in western blots as
crude antisera at a 1:1,000 dilution. for western blotting, 20 to 40 ag of
protein samples were fractionated by sds-page on a 12% acrylamide gel.
for tissue samples, epithelial/tumor sheets were isolated following dispase
digestion (23, 27). the samples were then placed directly into 200 al
reducing buffer [7% glycerol, 0.5 mmol/l edta, 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% sds, 10 mmol/l dtt, 60 mmol/l tris-hcl
( final ph 6.8)] and boiled for 5 min before freezing at 80jc. for tissue
culture cells, the cells were trypsinized and placed directly into reducing
buffer, boiled for 5 min, and frozen at 80jc. immunodetection protocols
have been described previously (31, 32), and normalization for loading
equivalence is provided by immunodetection of a-tubulin levels (t9026;
1:3,000; sigma-aldrich) or amido black staining.
peroxidase activity and peroxide level measurement. the gpx
activity assay measures  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  activity. briefly, epithelial sheets
or cells were homogenized in sample buffer [50 mmol/l tris (ph 7.5),
5 mmol/l edta, 1 mmol/l  xxxd26xxx ] and spun at 2,000  g for 10
min (4jc). the supernatant was then collected and frozen at 80jc until
used in the gpx assay. the gpx assay measures nadph disappearance in
the presence of  xxxg981xxx  and gsh using tert-butylhydroperoxide as substrate (bioxytech). in experiments testing the ability of
peroxides to inactivate gpx, we used an in vitro reconstitution assay
comprising purified rbc gpx (g4013; sigma-aldrich) at a final concentration of 50 milliunits/ml in the gpx assay buffer. to this was added

770 amol/l tert-butylhydroperoxide for differing times and the gpx activity
was subsequently measured. a similar set of experiments was also
conducted using hek extracts as the gpx donor.
intracellular peroxide levels in cultured keratinocytes or the scc cell
lines colo-16 and scc25 were estimated using either dihydrorhodamine 123
or 5,6-chloromethyl-2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester
(cm-h2dcfda; molecular probes) using a facscalibur (becton dickinson).
total peroxide levels in normal or tumor epithelial tissue were estimated by
measuring horseradish peroxidase–mediated oxidation of phenol red in
tissue samples as described (33).
ko mouse strains and uv induction protocol. we have previously
generated  xxxg943xxx  / and  xxxg944xxx  / mice (c57bl/6j and 129s background;
ref. 5). the mice were housed under gold lighting (gec f40go tubes) that
does not emit uvb radiation. the solar-simulated uv (ssuv) radiation
source and protocol have been described (34). for the first week, mice
received a daily dose of 0.5  minimal erythemal daily dose (medd), and
for the next 19 weeks, 1.0  medd daily. at this time, the daily ssuv dose
was increased weekly to a final dose in weeks 23 to 27 of 2.5  medd.
tumor promotion was then accelerated by the topical application of 0.1 ml
0.01% (v/v) croton oil (sigma-aldrich)/acetone solution twice weekly for
10 weeks. tumors began to appear at weeks 35 to 36, and the croton oil
applications were discontinued. each mouse was examined for tumor
appearance, and tumors of diameter greater than f1 mm were mapped
and counted weekly. at the end of the study, pieces of tumor were collected
routinely for histopathologic analysis.
significance of the differences between the genotypes was assayed by the
mantel-haenszel log-rank assay for tumor incidence and by the balanced
anova assay and the kruskal-wallis test for tumor multiplicity (34).

 xxxg944xxx  mrna is selectively induced in sccs in vitro and
in vivo. analysis of mrna expression levels for  xxxg943xxx ,  xxxg944xxx ,  xxxg945xxx ,
and  xxxg946xxx  by real-time pcr using rna derived from proliferative or
nonproliferative/differentiated cultures of heks, scc25, or colo-16
cells indicated that only  xxxg944xxx  was consistently and significantly
increased in the scc cell lines (fig. 1a). this elevation was
independent of whether the cells were proliferative/undifferentiated or nonproliferative and differentiated.  xxxg943xxx  mrna expression
was slightly elevated in the colo-16 cells, whereas  xxxg945xxx  mrna
expression was elevated in the scc25 cells and confluent heks but
not in the colo-16 cells (fig. 1a).  xxxg946xxx  mrna was modestly
elevated in the colo-16 cells and, to a lesser extent, in the scc25
cells (fig. 1a). we next determined whether our in vitro findings
could be validated in patient lesions. we took three precancerous
sks and seven csccs from patients and found that, in all three sks
and in six of seven sccs, there was a significant and selective
increase in  xxxg944xxx  mrna (fig. 1b). a modest increase in  xxxg943xxx  and
 xxxg946xxx  mrna was also evident in most lesions (fig. 1b). these data

indicate that the  xxxg944xxx  mrna is expressed in keratinocytes and
that its expression is inducible. these data also show that
preneoplastic and neoplastic skin lesions are associated with
altered expression of gpx isoforms.
gpx activity is reduced in sccs in vitro and in vivo. to
examine gpx protein expression levels, we focused on  xxxg943xxx  and
 xxxg944xxx  because earlier studies have shown that  xxxg945xxx  is a secreted
isoform (6) and  xxxg946xxx  has a very restricted substrate preference
(8, 9). for these reasons,  xxxg945xxx  and  xxxg946xxx  are unlikely to contribute to
the intracellular peroxidase activity of heks and scc cells. western
blot analysis of  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  expression in heks and scc cell
lines indicated that both  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  protein were present
and that there was a modest increase in  xxxg943xxx  expression in the
cancer cell lines compared with normal keratinocytes (fig. 1c). the
induction of protein expression in the cell lines was clearly not as
great as for the mrna induction, which suggests that  xxxg943xxx  and
 xxxg944xxx  may be subject to complex transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational, and/or post-translational processing. in patient
sccs, the levels of protein expression more closely reflected the
mrna expression profiles.  xxxg943xxx  was not noticeably induced in
preneoplastic sks but was profoundly elevated in sccs compared
with foreskin samples (fig. 1d). similarly,  xxxg944xxx  protein expression
was low in skin and sks but was elevated in three of four sccs
(fig. 1d). because the assays used only the epithelial component of
the tumors, we can exclude the effects of any underlying interstitium. it should be noted that the scc and sk sample numbering
in figs. 2, 3, and 4 relates to the same patient sample throughout.

we next examined whether the changes in mrna and protein
expression, observed in vitro and in vivo, were reflected by
alterations in gpx activity. figure 2a shows that the gpx activity in
scc25 and colo-16 cells was significantly reduced (approximately
75% and 50%, respectively) relative to the hek control. similarly,
we found that two of three sks and four of five sccs had
significantly reduced gpx activity compared with normal epidermis (fig. 2b). conversely, one of three and one of five sks and sccs
had elevated gpx activity, respectively (fig. 2b). these data
indicate that, although  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  mrna and protein are
frequently induced in sccs, this is not reflected in a corresponding
increase in gpx activity. indeed, cscc patients 1, 3, and 5, in which
 xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  protein was most profoundly induced, had the
most reduced gpx activity. similarly, the gpx activity in two of
three sks is significantly less than in normal epidermis, yet the
protein level remains similar. these data, plus the expression/
activity data for the csccs, clearly show that gpx activity does not
correlate with protein expression levels. it could be argued that the
low levels of  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx  protein expression in the epidermis
or sks indicate that they do not contribute to the gpx activity
measured in the normal epidermis. however, we have found that
gpx activity in wt mouse epidermis is 426 f 41 milliunits/mg
protein, whereas in  xxxg943xxx  /   xxxg944xxx  / dko mice (5) the activity
is reduced to 23 f 40 milliunits/mg protein. these data
convincingly show that the combined activity of  xxxg943xxx  and  xxxg944xxx 
is likely to account for almost all the gpx activity observed in the
epidermis and that the inactivation of gpx is due to a profound

decrease in the specific activity of the  xxxg943xxx  or  xxxg944xxx  isoforms.
thus, we show (a) that sccs in vitro and in vivo possess
significantly less gpx activity than their nontransformed counterparts, (b) that the reduction of gpx activity is not due to reduced
gpx protein expression and, (c) that peroxidase activity is subject
to post-translational regulation.
reduced gpx activity is associated with elevated peroxide
levels. we determined whether gpx deficiency would result in
pathologic increases in the total intracellular peroxide burden in
sccs. formal examination of this question indicated that the
reduced gpx activity observed in scc cell lines was associated
with elevated peroxide levels compared with normal heks
(fig. 3a). moreover, when we examined the peroxide levels in
sccs, we found that all the lesions were associated with increased
peroxide levels (fig. 3b). if one compares the same scc patient
sample number between the figures, it becomes very clear that gpx
activity is inversely related to peroxide burden (fig. 3c). thus,
reduced peroxidase activity is associated with an increased
peroxidative burden in the patient lesions.
 xxxg944xxx  deficiency predisposes mice to uv-induced scc
formation. to determine whether gpx deficiency could be a
causative factor in uv-induced scc formation, we examined the
ability of chronic low-dose uva and uvb exposure to induce scc
in wt mice or  xxxg943xxx  / or  xxxg944xxx  / mice (fig. 4a–d). we selected
low-dose uva and uvb irradiation protocols similar to those
implicated in cscc formation in humans (i.e., ssuv irradiation;
ref. 34). analysis of tumor incidence by the mantel-haenszel test
showed a highly significant increase in the tumor incidence in
the  xxxg944xxx  / mice (p < 0.001; n = 14) compared with the wt
control mice (n = 16; fig. 4a). in contrast, there was no significant
difference (p > 0.05) in tumor incidence between  xxxg943xxx  /
mice (n = 13) and wt control mice (fig. 4a). similarly, balanced
anova and the kruskal-wallis test for tumor multiplicity revealed

www.aacrjournals.org

a significant increase in progressive average tumor multiplicity in
the  xxxg944xxx  / mice (p < 0.0001) compared with wt control. in
contrast, this analysis showed no significant difference (p = 0.16)
between wt and  xxxg943xxx  / mice. analysis of the time from the start
of the trial to the time when the tumors reach 1 cm in diameter
showed there was no significant difference in the growth rates of
tumors between the wt (48.1 f 10 weeks) and  xxxg943xxx  / (51.7 f
14.6 weeks) and  xxxg944xxx  / mice (52.4 f 9.5 weeks). these data
unequivocally show that  xxxg944xxx  deficiency predisposes mice to
uv-induced scc formation.
intracellular peroxides regulate gpx activity. if gpx
deficiency is a causative event in uv-induced scc formation, then
it becomes important to understand the mechanism underlying
gpx inactivation in sccs. previous reports have shown that the
exposure of keratinocytes to exogenously added peroxides can
result in a reduction in gpx activity (29). if true, this would suggest
that the reduction in gpx activity we see in the majority of sccs
in vitro and in vivo may be a direct result of the elevation in
intracellular peroxide levels. to test whether this was plausible,
we incubated heks with agents that are known to increase
peroxide levels (i.e., h2o2, tert-butylhydroperoxide, and aminotriazole; fig. 5a). these experiments were designed to test whether
the elevation of peroxide levels in a normal keratinocyte could lead
to the inhibition of gpx activity and thus leave cells vulnerable to
oxidative damage. all of these treatments resulted in elevated
peroxide levels (fig. 5a). neither h2o2 nor aminotriazole caused a
reduction in gpx activity. however, the organic peroxide tertbutylhydroperoxide produced a profound reduction in gpx activity
(fig. 5a). in a further set of experiments, we treated the gpxdeficient colo-16 cell line with the peroxidase mimetic ebselen or
the antioxidant  xxxd3521xxx  (fig. 5b). we found that treatment of
colo-16 cells with ebselen or  xxxd3521xxx  resulted in a reduction
in peroxide levels that was accompanied by an increase in gpx

activity (fig. 5b). these data clearly show (a) that gpx activity can
be modulated directly/indirectly by conditions that alter peroxide
levels, (b) that the reduced gpx activity observed in scc cells can
be reversed by reducing the peroxidative/oxidative burden of the
cell, (c) that the elevated peroxidative burden observed in the scc
cells could contribute to the reduction in gpx activity observed
in the sccs in vitro or in vivo, and (d) that  xxxg943xxx / xxxg944xxx  may be
subjected to redox-sensitive post-translational regulation.
we next examined whether the ability of organic peroxides to
reduce gpx activity was a direct or indirect effect of tertbutylhydroperoxide addition. figure 5c shows that the addition
of tert-butylhydroperoxide to hek extracts did not result in gpx
inactivation (fig. 5c). however, if the hek extracts were
preincubated with tert-butylhydroperoxide for 60 min, there was
a significant reduction in gpx activity (fig. 5c). these data are
consistent with peroxide-mediated inactivation being mediated by
an indirect mechanism. peroxides are chemically unstable, and so
we examined whether the indirect inhibition of gpx activity could
be due to the nonenzymatic degradation of tert-butylhydroperoxide to a reactive intermediate. to test this, we repeated the
experiments in fig. 5c using purified  xxxg943xxx  protein rather than a
hek extract. these experiments gave similar results (fig. 5d) to
those obtained using the hek extracts. these data clearly show
that gpx activity can be inactivated indirectly by organic peroxides
and that this inhibition can result from the nonenzymatic
degradation of organic peroxide.

discussion
gpx deficiency and uv-induced cscc formation. the
present study has shown that human csccs are associated with
frequent reductions in gpx activity combined with a concomitant
elevation in intracellular peroxide levels. in addition, our data
indicate that  xxxg944xxx  inactivation acts as a predisposing factor for
uv-induced cscc formation in vivo. these data indicate that  xxxg944xxx 
inactivation should join a growing list of genetic and biological
defects affecting important regulatory pathways that have been

implicated in the formation of csccs. these defects commonly
target regulatory molecules involved in the p16-cyclin d-rb-e2f
axis (26, 35–37), the egfrec-ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
pathway (3, 35, 38), the p53-dna repair pathways (39, 40), or
telomerase activity (35). the present study now provides the first
direct evidence that disruptions to peroxide and ros metabolism
are direct contributors to uv-induced scc. such a conclusion is
entirely consistent with earlier studies, which showed that elevated
peroxide levels and peroxide-derived reactive intermediates were
associated with uv-induced skin cancers (14, 21) and that
antioxidants, such as  xxxd3521xxx , can inhibit uv-induced cscc
formation (41, 42). although uv irradiation is known to induce
elevations in ros and the ros-dependent 7,8-dihydroxyguanine
dna adduct in skin and cscc, there is growing acceptance that
this is predominantly due to the uva wavelength component of uv
irradiation (35, 43–45). this suggests that the contribution of  xxxg944xxx 
deficiency to uv-induced cscc may be restricted to the effects of
uva wavelengths. this would also suggest that, although the  xxxg944xxx 
enzyme affords protection from uva damage, it may not be
protective against uvb-induced effects (43) on cscc formation.
interestingly, uva and uvb are known to modulate local and
systemic immune function (41, 45). thus, the predisposition of
 xxxg944xxx -deficient mice to uv-induced carcinoma formation may be
attributable to defects in the keratinocytes as well as other cell
types. this certainly is the case with inflammation-induced
intestinal carcinomas in  xxxg943xxx / xxxg944xxx -deficient mice (5).
the finding that the  xxxg944xxx  enzyme plays a specific role in
protecting the epidermis from uv-induced cscc formation raises
the obvious question of what is the function of  xxxg944xxx  in the
epidermis. the weight of evidence would suggest that differences
between gpx isoform functions are likely to be dictated by
differences in substrate specificity or subcellular location of the
enzyme.  xxxg943xxx  is localized to the cytosol and mitochondria,
whereas  xxxg944xxx  is restricted to the cytosol (4, 15), suggesting that
differences in subcellular localization are not responsible for the
 xxxg944xxx -specific functions. in contrast, there is no data relating to the
identification of endogenous substrates for  xxxg944xxx  or  xxxg943xxx . we do

figure 6. proposed role for peroxides in regulating gpx
activity and peroxide toxicity. in normal keratinocytes (top ),
stressors lead to an accumulation of peroxides that can be
removed by the gpx enzymes. this transient elevation in
peroxides can also trigger a positive feedback loop in
which elevated peroxides induce  xxxg944xxx  transcription. if the
accumulation of peroxides is too great, this can trigger
apoptosis. chronic exposure to stressors/carcinogens or
metabolic defects can lead to a chronic accumulation of
peroxides that can induce  xxxg944xxx  transcription. if this
accumulation of peroxides occurs against a background of
defective apoptotic control, then the accumulation of
peroxides may overwhelm the ability of the cells to detoxify
peroxides and the peroxides may then be converted to
reactive intermediates that can inactivate the gpx
enzymes. such inactivation would then lead to a chronic
state of gpx deficiency and increasing peroxide-mediated
damage.

gpx inactivation in scc

know they are both capable of transforming h2o2 or model organic
peroxide substrates, but the identification of the physiologically or
pathologically relevant substrates for  xxxg944xxx  is unknown. clearly, the
identification of such substrates will give important insights into
the role of  xxxg944xxx  as a tumor protective enzyme in skin.
mechanism of post-translational inactivation of gpx.
because gpx inactivation is associated with cscc formation, it
is of considerable interest to identify how the gpx enzymes are
inactivated in cscc. in this regard, we know that gpx inactivity is
not due to mutations in the  xxxg944xxx / xxxg943xxx  transcripts (data not
shown) nor to selenium deficiency (all cells cultured in se2+containing medium). we also showed that gpx transcription and
translation is disrupted in sks and csccs but does not contribute
to the inactivation of gpx activity in sks and csccs. in contrast,
the inactivation of gpx activity observed in csccs and scc cell
lines clearly involves a post-translational mechanism and is likely
to be oxidation/peroxidation dependent. for example, it has been
previously reported that gpx activity in keratinocytes can be
reduced by exogenous organic peroxides but not by inorganic
peroxides (29). moreover, cysteine-containing and selenocysteinecontaining enzymes are generally considered to be vulnerable to
electrophilic attack (46, 47). our data extend these earlier
observations by showing that elevations in organic peroxide levels
can decrease gpx activity and, conversely, that reduction of
intracellular peroxide levels can increase endogenous gpx activity.
this reversibility would allow for prophylactic pharmacologic
interventions in high-risk patient groups (e.g., immunosuppressed
patients) to try and prevent cscc formation. in this regard, the
earlier reports that  xxxd3521xxx  can inhibit uv-induced scc
formation are entirely consistent with the results of the present
study and also support the thesis that an increased peroxidative
burden may contribute to uv-induced scc formation (41, 42).
of particular relevance to the in vivo situation is the observation
that the reduced gpx activity in vivo can be reversed by agents that
reduce the oxidative/peroxidative burden. we believe this reversibility is likely to be at the level of nascent protein synthesis for the
following reasons. gpxs have been reported to exist in three forms:
(a) a reduced active form, (b) a reversibly inactive form, or (c) an
irreversibly inactive oxidized form (48). therefore, the incubation
of the cancer cells with ebselen or  xxxd3521xxx  would provide a

reducing environment in which the oxidation and irreversible
inhibition of newly synthesized (not preexisting irreversibly
inhibited)  xxxg943xxx  or  xxxg944xxx  would be prevented. this would seem
to be the case, in vitro and in vivo, because if the inhibition of the
gpx activity were reversible, then it would be reversed under
the reducing conditions used in the assay. this implies that the
inactivation of gpx activity observed in the scc cells is most likely
to be irreversible in nature and that the only way to recover activity
is for newly synthesized gpx protein to be made in a reducing
environment (i.e., in the presence of antioxidants).
taken together, our data support a model (fig. 6) in which
normal keratinocytes are able to maintain intracellular peroxide
levels via gpx. however, if peroxides are elevated, in response to
stressors, the elevated peroxides then induce  xxxg944xxx  mrna (data
not shown) or, if sufficiently high, stimulate apoptosis. in this way,
the cells are protected from peroxide-mediated macromolecular
damage. however, if the stress stimuli occur in a cell with defective
apoptotic responses (e.g., p53 mutation), then the elevated peroxide
levels could lead to the inactivation of gpx activity and the further
elevation in damaging reactive intermediates. in this way, it can be
seen that an overwhelming carcinogenic insult may lead to a cycle
of events in which the protective enzymes may be chronically
‘‘inactivated’’ by an overwhelming peroxidative burden. this would
suggest that defects in apoptosis (e.g., p53 mutation) are an early
event in keratinocyte transformation followed by disruption to
peroxide metabolism in preneoplastic lesions (e.g., sks). this latter
event would make cells vulnerable to peroxidative/oxidative
damage and subsequent genetic and epigenetic damage. such a
sequence of events is observed in nontumorigenic p53-deficient
hacat cells, which can be fully transformed following exposure to
oxidative stress (49).
