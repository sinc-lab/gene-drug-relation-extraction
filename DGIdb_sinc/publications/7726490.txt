effects of  xxxd243xxx  and other inhibitors on pneumocystis carinii  xxxg633xxx .   xxxg633xxx  (dhod) is a pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme which is usually directly linked to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. antimalarial naphthoquinones such as  xxxd243xxx  ( xxxd243xxx ) inhibit malarial dhod by inhibiting electron transport. since  xxxd243xxx  also has therapeutic activity against pneumocystis carinii, the p. carinii dhod may also be an important drug target. organisms were obtained from immunosuppressed rats, incubated for 24 h in a short-term in vitro culture system, and then lysed. p. carinii lysates catalyzed the generation of  xxxd2794xxx  from dihydroorotate at a rate of 852 pmol/mg of protein per min. control preparations made from uninfected mice showed much less total enzymatic activity and enzyme specific activity. as expected, p. carinii dhod activity was susceptible to respiratory inhibitors such as cyanide, antimycin a, and salicylhydroxamic acid (sham). susceptibility to sham suggests the presence of an alternative oxidase. in contrast, neither pentamidine nor 5-hydroxy-6-demethylprimaquine (5h6dp), a quinone metabolite of primaquine, inhibited the enzyme.  xxxd243xxx  inhibited dhod by 76.3% at 100 microm and 36.5%  xxxd1891xxx  microm. a similar degree of inhibition was found when the organisms were preincubated with the drug.  xxxd243xxx  inhibited p. carinii growth in vitro at a somewhat lower concentration (between 0.3 and 3 microm). in contrast, plasmodium falciparum growth and enzyme activity are susceptible to nanomolar concentrations of  xxxd243xxx . thus, while it is possible that  xxxd243xxx  acts by inhibiting the p. carinii electron transport chain, the possibility of another drug target cannot be excluded.
