abstract
we have established a new method for the enzymatic diagnosis of  xxxg826xxx  ( xxxg826xxx  or  xxxg826xxx  dewciency) using mixed leukocytes. the method employs glycogen and 4-methylumbelliferyl--d-glucopyranoside (4mu-glc) as substrates
for measuring the lysosomal acid -glucosidase (acid glu) activity, and incorporates acarbose to eliminate the interference of unrelated
-glucosidases (predominantly  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx ). it is shown that 3.0 mol/l acarbose completely inhibits the  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  activity at ph 4.0, but the lysosomal acid glu activity by less than 5%. with this method, we determined the acid glu activity in
mixed leukocytes from 25 patients with  xxxg826xxx  (2 infantile and 23 late-onset cases), one gaa2/gaa2 homozygote and 30 healthy subjects. in the assay with glycogen as substrate, the addition of acarbose created a clear separation between the
patient and the control ranges. in the assay with 4mu-glc as substrate, the two ranges were fully separated but remained very close
despite the use of acarbose. the separation of the patient and normal ranges was improved considerably by taking the ratio of acarboseinhibited over uninhibited activity. a gaa2/gaa2 homozygote was correctly diagnosed with 4mu-glc but misdiagnosed as patient
when glycogen was used as substrate. we conclude that the inclusion of 3.0 mol/l acarbose in the assays with glycogen and 4mu-glc
substrates at ph 4.0 allows for the speciwc measurement of lysosomal acid glu activity in mixed leukocytes, thus enabling a reliable
diagnosis of  xxxg826xxx  in this specimen.

ized dewciency of the lysosomal enzyme acid -glucosidase
(acid glu; ec 3.2.1.20/3). the acid glu dewciency leads
to intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen in numerous
tissues, but avects primarily the skeletal muscles. there is a
broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, a range of residual
enzyme activities, and extensive genetic heterogeneity. the
clinical spectrum includes the early-onset rapidly progressive infantile form (classic  xxxg826xxx ) characterized by
cardiac involvement, the late-onset slowly progressive adult
forms and intermediate (childhood/juvenile) forms.
patients with typical infantile gsd ii manifest with

prominent cardiomegaly, hypotonia, hepatomegaly, and
death due to cardiorespiratory failure usually in the wrst
year of life. patients with late-onset gsd ii show a predominance of skeletal muscle weakness without cardiac
involvement and have a shortened life expectancy mostly
related to respiratory problems [1].
the clinical diagnosis is reliably conwrmed by the wnding
of a completely dewcient (infantile form) or markedly
reduced (juvenile and adult forms) activity of lysosomal
acid glu in cultured skin wbroblasts or muscle biopsy. it
is, however, time consuming to establish a wbroblast culture
and it is invasive to perform a muscle biopsy. a simple
assay of acid glu activity in mixed leukocytes from
peripheral blood would be ideal for routine diagnostic
practice, but is complicated by the interference of unrelated
-glucosidase isoenzymes, most of all by  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  (also called renal -glucosidase). this enzyme is
expressed in neutrophils and substantially contributes to
the activity measured at ph 4.0 [2–5]. since  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  is not expressed in lymphocytes, fractionated lymphocytes have been used as enzyme source [2,6,7], but
misdiagnosis may occur due to the potential contamination
with neutrophils. eb virus-transformed lymphocytes [4,8]
and phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes [9] also
exhibit the dewciency of acid glu activity in gsd ii, but
have considerably lower enzyme activity than wbroblasts,
which compromises the reliable measurement of residual
enzyme activity. various attempts have been made to deal
with the interference of  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  in the mixed
leukocytes assay; diverential analysis using antibodies
[2,10], inhibitors for acid glu [11–13] (e.g., maltose, turanose, and tris) and isoelectric precipitation of  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  at ph 5.0 [11]. to our knowledge, some diagnostic
laboratories currently use antibody based procedures for
the measurement of acid glu activity in mixed leukocytes,
but inhibitors are not used.
recently, three methods were published for newborn
screening of gsd ii in dried blood spots [14–16]. to prevent the interference of non-speciwc -glucosidases present
in this specimen, umapathysivam et al. captured acid glu
with an enzyme speciwc antibody [14], chamoles et al. used
maltose to inhibit the acid glu activity [15], and li et al.
used acarbose to inhibit the non-speciwc -glucosidases
[16]. acarbose is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1401xxx ,
sucrase, and  xxxg1401xxx  [17,18], and is used for management of
type ii diabetes [19]. we have investigated the use of acarbose to obtain a speciwc assay of acid glu in mixed leukocytes. we demonstrate the practicality of this new method
for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of gsd ii.
materials and methods
enzyme sources and chemicals
the precursor form of human acid glu was produced in genetically
engineered cho cells [20]. the mature form of acid glu was puriwed
from human placenta [21]. further, we used skin wbroblast cell lines from
a healthy subject and a patient with infantile gsd ii as well as peripheral

23

mixed leukocytes from healthy subjects and patients with infantile gsd ii
as enzyme source for establishing the procedure. for testing the validity of
the new diagnostic procedure, we used mixed leukocytes from 25 patients
with gsd ii (2 infantile and 23 late-onset cases) who were previously
diagnosed by enzyme assay on wbroblasts and by mutation analysis, from
30 healthy subjects, and from one subject homozygous for the gaa2
allele, a polymorphism (asp91asn) that lowers the aynity of acid glu
for glycogen [22]. the protocol was approved by the medical ethical
committee of erasmus mc.
fibroblasts were cultured under standard conditions in dulbecco’s
modiwed eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (50 ku/l
penicillin and 50 mg/l streptomycin). after reaching conxuency, the wbroblasts were harvested and washed with phosphate-buvered saline. the cell
pellets were stored at ¡80 °c until subsequent use. mixed leukocytes were
prepared from peripheral blood by lysing the erythrocytes in isotonic
ammonium chloride as previously described [23], and stored at ¡80 °c
until subsequent use. the pellets of wbroblasts (2–4 £ 106 cells) and mixed
leukocytes (2–4 £ 106 cells) were homogenized in 150 l water by sonicating on ice for two times 10 s, using a mse soniwer with a 3 mm diameter
tip size, set  xxxd1891xxx  m amplitude. the protein concentration of the cell
homogenates was measured using the pierce bca protein assay reagent
kit (rockford, il) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a calibrator. the protein
concentration of the homogenates was adjusted to 2.0–3.0 mg/ml unless
otherwise indicated.
glycogen (type iii, from rabbit liver, cat# g8876-5g), glucose,  xxxd2684xxx , and 4-methylumbelliferyl--d-glucopyranoside (4mu-glc)
were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). acarbose was from
toronto research chemicals (north york, canada). 2,2⬘-azino- xxxd3014xxx -ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, glucose oxidase, and
peroxidase were from roche (basel, switzerland). other chemicals were of
reagent grade and from merck (darmstadt, germany). fluorescence and
absorbance were read in a varioskan spectrophoto/spectroxuorometer (thermo electron corporation, vantaa, finland).

measurement of -glucosidase activity
assay of -glucosidase activity with glycogen
-glucosidase activity was measured with glycogen as substrate followed by an enzymatic determination of liberated glucose. briexy, 10 l
of the cell homogenate was added to 20 l of the substrate solution containing 75 g/l glycogen in 0.1 mol/l citrate/0.2 mol/l sodium-phosphate
buver, ph 4.0, with or without 4.5 mol/l acarbose (i.e., 3.0 mol/l acarbose in the wnal reaction mixture) (the substrate solution was stored frozen at ¡20 °c), and incubated for 4 h at 37 °c in a 1.5 ml reaction tube
(safe-lock tube, cat# 0030 120.086, eppendorf, hamburg, germany).
the reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °c for 5 min. the reaction
tube was immediately cooled on ice, and then 10 l of 100 mmol/l  xxxd2684xxx  and 300 l of the glucose-detection reagent were added. this
reagent contained 2.1 mmol/l of 2,2⬘-azino- xxxd3014xxx -ethylbenzthiazoline-6sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, 10 mmol/l mgcl2, 10,000 u/l glucose
oxidase (from aspergillus niger, grade i, cat# 105 147, roche, basel, switzerland), 4000 u/l peroxidase (from horse-radish, grade i, cat# 108 073,
roche, basel, switzerland), 0.2 g/l sodium azide, and 0.5 mol/l tris–hcl
buver at ph 7.0, and was stable for at least one month when stored at 4 °c,
in the dark. the reaction tube was then incubated at room temperature for
75 min and subsequently centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 3 min. a 250 l aliquot
of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate (nunc,
roskilde, denmark), and the absorbance was measured at 420 nm with
the varioskan spectrophoto/spectroxuorometer. the enzyme activity
was expressed as nanomoles glucose released per hour per milligram cellular protein (nmol/h/mg protein) unless otherwise indicated. to avoid erroneous results attributable to turbidity of the glycogen solution and the free
cellular glucose, we also performed the assay without adding the cell
homogenate (glycogen blank) and without adding the glycogen (sample
blank). for the samples from the healthy subjects, the readings were at
least 10-fold higher than the sample blank. for the samples from the
patients, the readings were at least twice the sample blank. the activity
was calculated after correcting for glycogen and sample blanks. as a

calibrator for the measurement of glucose, we used 2.0 mmol/l glucose
dissolved in distilled water with 0.2 g/l sodium azide instead of the sample.
assay of -glucosidase activity with 4mu-glc
-glucosidase activity was also measured xuorometrically with 4muglc as substrate according to our previous report with minor changes
[24]. briexy, 10 l of the cell homogenate was added to 60 l of the substrate solution containing 1.47 mmol/l of 4mu-glc in 0.067 mol/l citrate/0.13 mol/l sodium-phosphate buver at ph 4.0 with and without
3.5 mol/l acarbose (i.e., 3.0 mol/l acarbose in the wnal reaction mixture)
(the substrate solution was stored frozen at ¡20 °c) in a 96-well white
microtiter plate (optiplate-96, cat# 6005290, packard, meriden, ct). the
reaction mixture was then incubated at 37 °c for 2 h, and the reaction was
stopped by addition of 200 l of 0.5 m  xxxd3212xxx  buver at ph
10.7 with 0.25 g/l triton x-100. the xuorescence intensity was measured
with the varioskan spectrophoto/spectroxuorometer at excitation
and emission wave lengths of 365 and 448 nm, respectively, and corrected
for substrate blank without cell homogenate. as a calibrator for the measurement of liberated 4-methylumbelliferone, we used 125 mol/l of 4methylumbelliferone in 20 mmol/l sodium-phosphate buver at ph 7.0
instead of the sample. this stock solution was stored at ¡20 °c. the
enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles 4-methylumbelliferone
released per hour per milligram cellular protein (nmol/h/mg protein)
unless otherwise indicated. the ic50 values were determined by plotting
residual enzyme activity against inhibitor concentration, and extrapolated
graphically.

results
the evect of acarbose on diverent -glucosidase activities

fig. 1. inhibitory evect of acarbose on acid glu activity with glycogen
and 4mu-glc at ph 4.0. the mature form and the precursor of acid
glu were incubated with glycogen or 4mu-glc as substrate at ph 4.0
and diverent concentrations of acarbose (0, 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, and
486 mol/l). the assay was performed as described in materials and
methods except that the incubation time was 30 min with both substrates.
the enzyme activities were expressed as % of those without acarbose. the

acarbose is a synthetic compound mimicking a glucose
tetra-saccharide. it is used for the treatment of type ii diabetes as it inhibits the intestinal  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx 
activity [17–19] and thereby prevents a sharp postprandial
rise of the serum glucose concentration. besides, the drug is
known to also inhibit the lysosomal acid glu activity and
causes lysosomal glycogen storage when administered
intravenously to rats [25].

contain  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  [24]. at the chosen concentration of 3.0 mol/l, acarbose had no substantial evect on
the -glucosidase activities of a healthy subject measured
over the ph range of 3.0–8.0 (fig. 2a). fig. 2b shows the
outcome of a similar experiment with wbroblasts from a
patient with infantile gsd ii, lacking acid glu activity. it
conwrms that 3.0 mol/l acarbose does not inhibit the neutral -glucosidase activities in wbroblasts.

the evect of acarbose on lysosomal acid glu
we used for this experiment two diverent forms of acid
glu including the mature 76 kda form puriwed from
human placentas and the 110 kda recombinant human acid
glu precursor from genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary cells (cho). the inhibitory evect of acarbose
was measured at ph 4.0 (fig. 1). in a range from 1 to
486 mol/l, acarbose inhibited the acid glu activity in a
dose-dependent manner. the ic50 were 81 mol/l for the
mature enzyme and 59 mol/l for the precursor using
4mu-glc as substrate, and 54 mol/l for the mature
enzyme using glycogen as substrate. less than 5% inhibition was observed at concentrations below 3.0 mol/l. the
glycogen degrading activity of the precursor was too low to
investigate the evect of acarbose with this substrate.

the evect of acarbose on  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx 
by contrast, 3.0 mol/l acarbose had a considerable
impact on the -glucosidase activity of mixed leukocytes
measured with either glycogen or 4mu-glc substrates
over the same ph range of 3.0–8.0 (fig. 3). with 4muglc substrate (figs. 3a and b), a broad curve of -glucosidase activities was observed, hence it was impossible
to distinguish the various isoenzymes. only in the presence of 3.0 mol/l acarbose, it was evident that the
patient lacks acid glu activity at ph 4.0 (fig. 3b). there
were two main peaks of activity in the normal cells when
glycogen was used as substrate without acarbose
(fig. 3c). comparison of the ph prowles obtained with
glycogen (fig. 3c) and 4mu-glc (fig. 3a) conwrmed
that the major neutral activities do not degrade glycogen
[24]. the peak of activity at ph 4.0 rexects mainly lysosomal acid glu activity, because most of the activity in
the control persists in the presence of 3.0 mol/l acarbose
(fig. 3c) and the peak is missing in the patient with acid
glu dewciency (figs. 3c and d). by deduction, the activity measured with glycogen in the mixed leukocytes from

the evect of acarbose on neutral -glucosidases
to examine the evect of acarbose on the neutral -glucosidase activities with 4mu-glc, we used cultured human
wbroblasts as enzyme source. these cells contain, in addition to lysosomal acid glu, neutral isoenzymes but do not

control (a) and a patient with infantile gsd ii (b). the assays were performed as described in materials and methods.

mixed leukocytes from a healthy control (a, c) and a patient with infantile gsd ii (b, d). assays were performed as described in materials and methods
except that the protein concentration in the homogenates was adjusted to 2.0–3.0 mg/ml for the assay with glycogen and to 1.0–1.5 mg/ml for the assay
with 4mu-glc.

the patient with infantile gsd ii rexects predominantly
 xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  activity (fig. 3d). thus, the mixed
leukocytes from this patient were used to examine the
evect of acarbose on the  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  activity
with glycogen at ph 6.0 (fig. 4). even low concentrations
of acarbose (1.0–3.0 mol/l) showed considerable inhibition of  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  activity, however, 20%
residual activity remained even at high concentrations of
up to 243 mol/l acarbose (data not shown). the inset
shows the same evect of increasing concentrations of
acarbose on the activity measured with 4mu-glc at
ph 4.0.

diagnostic application of the assay procedure on mixed
leukocytes
based on these wndings, we established the assay for acid
glu activity, and evaluated the validity of the method for
diagnosis of gsd ii in mixed leukocytes with glycogen as
substrate at ph 4.0 in the presence and absence of 3.0 mol/
l acarbose. fig. 5 presents the results obtained with mixed
leukocytes from 30 healthy subjects, 25 patients with gsd
ii (2 infantile and 23 late-onset cases), and a gaa2/gaa2
homozygote. addition of acarbose to the reaction mixture
improved the discrimination between the patient and the

nated from controls (fig. 6a). the presence of acarbose
almost eliminated the overlap of the patient and control
ranges, but the discrimination remained poor (fig. 6b).
however, the patient and control ranges were completely
separated from each other when the data were expressed as
the ratio of activities measured in the presence and absence
of acarbose (fig. 6c). the mean activities with and without
acarbose, and the standard deviations are given in the legend of fig. 6. with this 4mu-glc substrate, the case of
gaa2/gaa2 homozygosity was clearly diagnosed as
unavected.

with glycogen at ph 6.0 and 4mu-glc at ph 4.0.  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx 
activities were determined with glycogen at ph 6.0 (closed circles) and with
4mu-glc at ph 4.0 (inset; open circles) in the presence of various concentrations of acarbose using mixed leukocytes from a patient with infantile
gsd ii. assays were performed as described in materials and methods.

control ranges considerably. the gaa2/gaa2 homozygote
was diagnosed as being a gsd ii patient irrespective of the
use of acarbose. the mean activities with and without acarbose, and the standard deviations are given in the legend of
fig. 5. mixed leukocytes were also subjected to the measurement of acid glu activity with 4mu-glc at ph 4.0 in
the presence and absence of 3.0 mol/l acarbose (fig. 6).
without acarbose, gsd ii patients could not be discrimi-

we have established a speciwc assay for the enzymatic
diagnosis of gsd ii using mixed leukocytes. the method
comprises the use of conventional substrates, glycogen and
4mu-glc, in combination with acarbose to inhibit the
interfering activity of  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx . mixed leukocytes contain  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  (renal -glucosidase)
and neutral -glucosidases ab and c in addition to lysosomal acid glu [1]. all of these isoenzymes cleave the artiwcial substrate 4mu-glc that is commonly used to
determine the lysosomal acid glu activity. we have shown
that the neutral -glucosidases do not interfere with the
measurement of acid glu activity with 4mu-glc at ph
4.0 because of their far higher ph optimum (fig. 2b for
wbroblasts, and fig. 3b for mixed leukocytes). however,
 xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  with a ph optimum around 6.0 has

glycogen as substrate at ph 4.0 in mixed leukocytes from 30 healthy subjects (control), 23 late-onset patients (gsd ii-ad), and 2 infantile patients (gsd
ii-inf) with gsd ii and a case with gaa2/gaa2 genotype (gaa2) in the absence (a) and presence (b) of 3.0 mol/l acarbose. the activities without

activities with acarbose were 115.4 § 41.9 for control, 4.5 § 3.9 for gsd ii-ad, 0.5 and 3.1 for gsd ii-inf, and 7.1 for gaa2. broken lines represent
mean § 2sd of healthy controls. the assay was performed as described in materials and methods, and the data were expressed as an average of duplicate
determinations.

fig. 6. -glucosidase activities in mixed leukocytes with 4mu-glc in the presence and absence of acarbose. -glucosidase activity with 4mu-glc as a
substrate was determined at ph 4.0 in mixed leukocytes from 30 healthy subjects (control), 23 late-onset patients (gsd ii-ad), and 2 infantile patients
(gsd ii-inf) with gsd ii and a case with gaa2/gaa2 (gaa2) in the absence (a) and presence (b) of 3.0 mol/l acarbose. the data were also expressed
as ratio (c) of the enzyme activities (with/without acarbose). the activities without acarbose (mean § sd, nmol/h/mg protein) were 28.9 § 11.5 for control,
20.2 § 5.9 for gsd ii-ad, 25.6 and 7.5 for gsd ii-inf, and 20.6 for gaa2. the activities with acarbose were 13.9 § 6.2 for control, 3.2 § 0.9 for gsd ii-ad,
3.7 and 1.6 for gsd ii-inf, and 7.6 for gaa2. the ratio of the activities were 0.48 § 0.09 for control, 0.16 § 0.02 for gsd ii-ad, 0.14 and 0.21 for gsd iiinf, and 0.37 for gaa2. broken lines represent mean § 2sd of healthy controls. the assay was performed as described in materials and methods, and the
data were expressed as an average of duplicate determinations.

substantial activity at ph 4.0 and actually prohibits the
enzymatic diagnosis of gsd ii using mixed leukocytes
especially with 4mu-glc as substrate (figs. 3a, b and
6a). the problem of the  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  “contamination” is largely solved when glycogen instead of 4muglc is used as substrate at ph 4.0 (fig. 5a). nevertheless,
in the routine diagnostic process the -glucosidase activities
of some leukocyte samples will fall in the “grey zone”
between the patient and normal ranges.
acarbose, in a wnal concentration of 3.0 m/l, inhibits
the  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  activity completely (fig. 4),
while no considerable inhibition (<5%) of acid glu is
observed using either glycogen or 4mu-glc as substrate
(fig. 1). the residual activity that remains at ph 6.0, even in
the presence of high inhibitor concentrations (fig. 4), suggests that there is an additional -glucosidase isoenzyme in
mixed leukocytes, which is quite resistant to acarbose and
has a ph optimum around 6.0 (figs. 3b and d). the same
suggestion was raised by dreyfus et al. using antibodies
against acid glu and  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx  [3]. this additional isoenzyme is unlikely to interfere with the measurement of the lysosomal acid glu activity with glycogen
substrate because it has very little activity at ph 4.0
(fig. 3d). the activity of this isoenzyme with 4mu-glc
substrate at ph 4.0 is higher (fig. 3b).
based on these wndings, we optimized the analytical conditions for the measurement of the lysosomal acid glu
activity in mixed leukocytes and obtained a procedure that
is useful for routine diagnostic handling. of the two substrates used, we give preference to glycogen because glyco-

gen is the natural substrate, the activity of non-speciwc
-glucosidases at ph 4.0 is lower with glycogen than with
4mu-glc (compare figs. 3b with d and 5b with 6b), and
the use of glycogen provides the best separation between
the range of control and patient activities. we propose the
following procedure for patients with a diverential diagnosis of gsd ii. at wrst, the acid glu activity should be
determined in mixed leukocytes using glycogen in the presence of 3.0 mol/l acarbose. according to our wndings,
patients whose activity falls in the normal range do not
have gsd ii. second, if the activity falls below the normal
range, the dewciency should be conwrmed by measuring the
enzyme activity with 4mu-glc at ph 4.0 in the presence
and absence of acarbose and taking the ratio of measured
activities. this excludes the cases of acid glu pseudo-dewciency caused by the gaa2 allele (figs. 5, 6b, and c)
encoding a non-pathogenic form of acid glu with very
low activity for glycogen but close to normal activity for
4mu-glc [22]. of note, gaa2/gaa2 homozygotes are
very rare (1 in 1000 individuals), but gaa2 carriers (1 in 16
individuals) will be encountered every so often. the acid
glu activity of these carriers is expected to fall in the normal range using 4mu- glc substrate and acarbose, but is
likely to fall in the grey zone between the patient and the
normal range using glycogen as substrate. gsd ii carriers
(1 in 100 individuals) are likely to fall in the grey zone with
both substrates. third, when the assay on mixed leukocytes
remains inconclusive, the enzyme diagnosis should be
repeated on cultured skin wbroblasts being the most reliable
and robust approach for diagnosis of gsd ii, or dna

analysis can be employed. dna analysis should be the wrst
method of choice in families with proven gsd ii because
the parents of the proband and statistically 50% of the
ovspring are carriers with an enzyme activity that will be
diycult to interpret in any enzymatic assay. the real power
of our new approach for enzymatic diagnosis using mixed
leukocytes has to be evaluated in long term practice.
methodological approaches for newborn screening of
gsd ii have recently been published based on measuring
the acid glu activity in dried blood spots [14–16]. the
dried blood spots also contain  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx 
derived from neutrophils [26]. our wndings suggest that the
method of chamoles et al. [15] can be simpliwed by using
3.0 mol/l acarbose to inhibit the  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx 
activity instead of maltose to inhibit the lysosomal acid
glu activity, and by measuring only at ph 4.0. li et al., in
their assay employing tandem mass spectrometry with a
synthetic lipidated substrate for lysosomal acid glu, used
80 mol/l acarbose to inhibit the contaminating -glucosidases in blood spots [16]. we experienced that 80 mol/l
acarbose is too high in our assay of acid glu in mixed leukocytes with glycogen and 4mu-glc substrates, because it
inhibits the acid glu activity for more than 50% (fig. 1).
in conclusion, we have established a new method for the
diagnosis of gsd ii in a routine diagnostic setting using
mixed leukocytes. in this method, 3.0 mol/l acarbose is
used to eliminate the interference of  xxxg1401xxx – xxxg1401xxx 
activity from the neutrophils.
