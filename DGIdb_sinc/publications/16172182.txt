this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of concomitant lowdose aspirin and  xxxd2517xxx  in healthy subjects. participants received  xxxd2517xxx  400 mg once daily (n = 14) or placebo (n = 14) for 11 days, with concomitant low-dose aspirin
(75 mg once daily) from days 5 to 11. ex vivo
pharmacodynamic assessments included assays of platelet
aggregation and urinary thromboxane and prostacyclin metabolite profile.  xxxd208xxx –stimulated platelet aggregation was reduced from 76.3% on day 4 to 4.8% on day 11 in
the placebo group and from 75.8% on day 4 to 5.1% on day

steoarthritis (oa) and rheumatoid arthritis (ra)
are chronic conditions that frequently occur alongside the development of cardiovascular disease.1,2 traditional nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids) and selective  xxxg1884xxx  (cox2) inhibitors are widely used for the treatment of pain
and inflammation associated with oa and ra.3 aspirin has proven antithrombotic activity and is widely
used for the prevention of major thrombotic events
such as myocardial infarction.4,5 thus, in patient populations susceptible to arthritis, it is likely that low-dose
aspirin may be coprescribed with either an nsaid or a
selective cox-2 inhibitor. the observation that the traditional nsaid, ibuprofen, competitively inhibits the
antiplatelet aggregation properties of aspirin6,7 raised

concomitantly administered treatments for pain and
cardiovascular disease.8
the efficacy and adverse event (ae) profile of traditional nsaids is primarily related to their inhibition of
cox, the enzyme involved in the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx  to the prostaglandins, thromboxane
a2 (txa2) and prostacyclin (pgi2). there are 2 main
cox isoforms: cox-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues throughout the body, including
platelets and the gastric mucosa. this isoform maintains physiological functions such as vascular homeostasis and gastric cytoprotection.9 the second isoform,
cox-2, has a restricted pattern of distribution under
normal physiological conditions, yet is highly induced
at sites of inflammation and cell proliferation.9
 xxxg1884xxx  inhibition is the main mechanism
underlying the clinical efficacy of traditional nsaids
and selective cox-2 inhibitors.10 however, the concomitant inhibition of cox-1 by traditional nsaids is
associated with loss of gastric cytoprotection and the
development of serious gastrointestinal (gi) safety concerns.11,12 aspirin and traditional nsaids share a common binding site on cox-1, supporting the potential
for a competitive interaction. in contrast with traditional nsaids, which reversibly inhibit cox-1, aspi-

rin irreversibly inhibits platelet cox-1 activity by acetylating a composite serine residue.13,14 this results in
more than 95% irreversible inhibition of txa2 production and subsequent inhibition of txa2-mediated
platelet aggregation.15 although the potential for interaction between aspirin and ibuprofen (and possibly
other nsaids) has been realized, no such effect has
been observed between aspirin and the selective cox2 inhibitors, rofecoxib,6,7,16 celecoxib,17 or  xxxd3481xxx .18
 xxxd2517xxx  is a novel selective cox-2 inhibitor
with a short plasma half-life (mean 4 hours),19 developed
for the management of chronic pain associated with oa,
ra, and acute pain.20-22 in clinical studies in patients
with oa or ra,  xxxd2517xxx  has demonstrated significant pain relief and improved physical function.23,24 in
addition, in acute pain, such as pain following dental
surgery,  xxxd2517xxx  provided fast and effective analgesia.25 the safety profile of  xxxd2517xxx  has been recently evaluated in more than 18 000 patients with oa
in the therapeutic arthritis research and gastrointestinal event trial (target) study.  xxxd2517xxx  was associated with a 79% reduction in ulcer complications
compared with nsaids in patients not taking low-dose
aspirin for cardioprotection, without a statistically significant increase in the rate of serious cardiovascular
events.26
because it is likely that  xxxd2517xxx  will be administered to patients who are receiving low-dose aspirin for
cardioprotection, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential interaction of  xxxd2517xxx  with the
antiplatelet activity of aspirin.
methods
this was a single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in healthy
subjects performed in france. the study received ethics committee (institutional review board) approval
from the consultative committee for the protection of
persons involved in biomedical research of parisbroussais-hegp hospital. the study was conducted
according to good clinical practice guidelines and in
accordance with the declaration of helsinki (1964 and
subsequent revisions). all subjects were required to
provide written informed consent prior to the start of
the study.
subjects
healthy males or females aged between 18 and 45 years
and within –15% to +20% of ideal body weight were
recruited. inclusion also required subjects to be nonsmokers and female subjects to be surgically sterilized,
clinical studies

postmenopausal (with no regular menstrual bleeding
for at least 2 years), or using double-barrier local contraception. subjects using aspirin within the previous
4 weeks or any over-the-counter (otc) medications
within the previous 2 weeks were excluded. acetaminophen (paracetamol) use was allowed but was recorded as a concomitant medication. subjects with
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a
history of drug allergy were excluded.
study design
baseline demographic information, medical background information, and concomitant medications
were recorded. subjects were randomized to one of two
11-day dosing sequences:
sequence 1:  xxxd2517xxx  (prexige)® 400 mg once daily
(od) for 11 days with simultaneous concomitant administration of aspirin (75 mg od) for 7 days from days
5 to 11
sequence 2: placebo for 11 days with simultaneous concomitant administration of aspirin (75 mg od) for 7
days from days 5 to 11 (figure 1)

all subjects refrained from physical exercise from 7
days prior to the study until study completion (day 12),
and no alcohol, grapefruit juice, or xanthine-containing
foods or beverages were allowed for the duration of the
study. all subjects had a fluid intake of at least 200 ml/
h during waking hours on all study days. no additional
medication was permitted within 14 days of the study
start until study completion. the dose of aspirin used
in this study followed the recommendations of local
medical associations and health authorities.
assessments and variables
blood and urine samples for pharmacodynamic assessments were obtained at baseline and on days 4 and
11 (ie, before and after 7 days of concomitant aspirin
treatment).  xxxd208xxx –induced and collageninduced platelet aggregation was used as a marker of
platelet function predose on days –1 and 4 and at 2
hours postdose on day 11. platelet aggregation was
measured by optical densitometry according to the
born method.27 briefly, platelet-rich plasma (prepared
by centrifugation at 250g for 10 minutes) was mixed
with  xxxd208xxx  (final concentration 1 mm) or
collagen (final concentration 1 µg/ml), and the reaction was followed for 300 seconds to determine the
maximal platelet aggregation values.

b2 (txb2) (the stable derivative of txa2) levels via an ex
vivo assay in human serum. levels of txb2 were determined using a commercially available enzyme
immunoassay kit (correlate-eia, txb2; assay designs,
inc, ann arbor, mich). measurement of the urinary excretion rate of txb2 was done with the same enzyme
immunoassay. pgi2 is unstable, and for this reason, its
production is typically monitored by measurement of
6-keto pgf1alpha produced by the nonenzymatic hydration
of pgi2 and by 2,3-dinor-6-keto pgf1alpha produced by further metabolism in the urine. in this study, both metabolites were measured in urine using a commercially
available enzyme immunoassay (correlate-eia, assay
designs, inc).
safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring
and recording all aes and serious aes. in addition,
routine blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ecg), vital signs, and physical examinations were conducted at 24 hours after the final
study dose.
statistical analyses
the effect of the interaction of  xxxd2517xxx  on the inhibition of platelet aggregation due to aspirin was assessed by calculating the 90% confidence intervals
(cis) for the ratio of the platelet aggregation values
(coadministration of  xxxd2517xxx  plus aspirin/
coadministration of placebo plus aspirin) at 2 hours
postdose on day 11. similar analyses for serum txb2 at
2 hours postdose, as well as the hourly rate of urinary
txb2 and pgi2 excretion on day 11, were performed.
all values were adjusted for the corresponding
baseline (day 1, predose) values.
the effect of  xxxd2517xxx  on platelet aggregation
was assessed on day 4 by calculating the 90% cis for

lar analysis for serum txb2 and the hourly rate of urinary txb2 and pgi2 excretion on day 4 was performed.
all values were adjusted for the corresponding baseline (day 1, predose) values. a lack of effect of
 xxxd2517xxx  on the platelet aggregation properties of
aspirin was to be concluded if the 90% cis about the
day 4 and day 11 ratios were both contained within the
0.8 to 1.25 limits. assuming independence of the 2
tests, each with 90% power, a joint power of approximately 80% is achieved. with a coefficient of variation
of 0.16, it was estimated that 12 subjects per group
would ensure at least 90% power in each test to show
that the 90% ci for the ratio of platelet aggregation of
 xxxd2517xxx  plus aspirin compared with placebo plus
aspirin was within the 0.8 to 1.25 equivalence limits if
the ratio was 1. if the true ratio was 1.05, then the power
of the individual tests would be just over 80%, giving a
joint power of approximately 67%. to achieve
complete data sets, a total of 14 subjects per group were
enrolled.
results
study population
a total of 28 subjects was randomized to  xxxd2517xxx 
400 mg od or placebo, and all subjects completed the
study according to the protocol. baseline demographics of the study group were comparable between treatment groups. the subjects were predominantly male
caucasians, with a mean age of 31 years.
platelet aggregation
 xxxd2517xxx  alone had no effect on either arachidonic
acid–mediated or collagen-mediated platelet aggregation (figure 3).  xxxd2517xxx  was comparable with placebo in both instances, in that ratios of the geometric
means ( xxxd2517xxx /placebo) of the platelet aggregation values were all close to unity, and the 90% cis for
the ratio were contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 limits
(figure 2). aspirin alone strongly inhibited
 xxxd208xxx –mediated platelet aggregation (geometric mean under placebo: 76.3%; geometric mean
under placebo and aspirin: 4.8%) (figure 3).
the corresponding values for aspirin-mediated inhibition with coadministration of  xxxd2517xxx  were similar
(geometric mean under  xxxd2517xxx : 75.8%; geometric
mean under  xxxd2517xxx  and aspirin: 5.1%) (figure 3).
in the presence of aspirin, ratios of the geometric means
( xxxd2517xxx /placebo) of the platelet aggregation values
were again close to unity (figure 2). aspirin had a modest
inhibitory effect (~30%) on collagen-mediated platelet

txb2 levels were similar in both the  xxxd2517xxx  and
placebo treatment groups: 65.2 ng/ml and 78.6 ng/ml,
respectively. serum txb2 levels were markedly reduced on day 11. however, there was no notable difference between the  xxxd2517xxx  plus aspirin and the placebo plus aspirin groups, the geometric means being
2.3 ng/ml and 3.4 ng/ml, respectively.

the corresponding values for aspirin-mediated inhibition with coadministration of  xxxd2517xxx  were similar
(geometric mean under  xxxd2517xxx : 79.5%; geometric
mean under  xxxd2517xxx  and aspirin: 55.9%).
serum txb2 levels
serum txb2 measures manifested high variability. on
day 4 (preaspirin),  xxxd2517xxx  alone had no effect on
serum levels of txb2. the geometric means for serum

clinical studies

urinary endpoint results were also highly variable. on
day 4 (preaspirin),  xxxd2517xxx  alone had no effect on
urinary excretion of txb2. the geometric means for urinary txb2 excretion were 81.0 ng/h for  xxxd2517xxx 
and 89.4 ng/h for placebo (figure 4). aspirin strongly
inhibited urinary txb2 excretion (reflecting wholebody thromboxane production and cox-1 inhibition)
by approximately 55% (geometric mean under placebo: 89.4 ng/h; geometric mean under placebo and aspirin: 39.1 ng/h). however, the degree of inhibition of
cox-1 by aspirin was not affected by the coadministration of  xxxd2517xxx  (geometric mean under  xxxd2517xxx :
81.0 ng/h; geometric mean under  xxxd2517xxx  and aspirin: 33.9 ng/h). urinary txb2 excretion was also
markedly reduced on day 11, with the geometric means
for the  xxxd2517xxx  plus aspirin and the placebo plus
aspirin groups being 33.9 ng/h and 39.1 ng/h, respectively. the geometric means of hourly urinary excretion for pgi2 at baseline were 36.3 ng/h and 46.7 ng/h in
the groups randomized to  xxxd2517xxx  and placebo, respectively. on day 4 (preaspirin), the geometric means
for pgi2 excretion were similar in both the  xxxd2517xxx 
and placebo treatment groups, with rates of 33.4 and
42.0 ng/h, respectively. concomitant administration of
aspirin did not affect pgi2 excretion in either treatment
group. on day 11, the pgi2 excretion rate was 31.0 and
38.0 ng/h in the  xxxd2517xxx  and placebo treatment
groups, respectively.
safety and tolerability
there were no serious aes, and no subjects discontinued due to aes. in total, 10 aes were reported in 5
subjects during the study. all were mild or moderate
in nature. nine of these aes were gi related and occurred during the aspirin treatment phase: 3 in the
 xxxd2517xxx  group (upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia,
nausea) and 6 in the placebo group (upper abdominal
pain, vomiting, 4 cases of nausea). one ae (mild headache) was reported in the  xxxd2517xxx  group prior to receiving the aspirin dose on day 5. no clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or

discussion
this study confirmed the marked ability of low-dose
aspirin to inhibit cox-1-mediated platelet function—
specifically, a reduction in platelet aggregation and
thromboxane production. the study also indicated
that coadministration of the novel selective cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd2517xxx , did not interfere with the inhibitory effect of aspirin on  xxxd208xxx –mediated or
collagen-mediated platelet aggregation to any clinically meaningful extent. the lack of an effect of
 xxxd2517xxx  on aspirin-mediated inhibition of platelet
function seen in this study is significant given recent
concerns over the potential for interaction between
concomitantly administered treatments for pain and
cardiovascular disease.8
although traditional nsaids may exert antiplatelet
effects due to reversible inhibition of cox-1, aspirin, in
contrast, provides irreversible inhibition of cox-1 and
therefore complete and permanent inhibition of txa2mediated platelet aggregation.15 this effect was confirmed in this study, where low-dose aspirin strongly
inhibited  xxxd208xxx –mediated platelet aggregation. however, this inhibition was not affected by the
coadministration of  xxxd2517xxx . these findings are in
line with studies investigating the potential for interaction between low-dose aspirin and other cox-2 selective inhibitors.16-18

1176 • j clin pharmacol 2005;45:1172-1178

serum levels of txb2 and urinary txb2 and pgi2 metabolite excretion rates were confounded by high variability, and although geometric ratios were close to
unity, the broad cis meant that the lack of any effect of
 xxxd2517xxx  on serum and urinary eicosanoids, in
terms of aspirin therapy, could not be demonstrated in
this study. however, the txb2 data were consistent
with the observation that coadministration of
 xxxd2517xxx  had no clinically meaningful effect on
aspirin-mediated inhibition of platelet cox-1 activity.
similar findings were also reported in another pharmacodynamic study of  xxxd2517xxx , which showed that
 xxxd2517xxx  400 mg od or 800 mg od did not have any
effect on urinary txb2 excretion in patients with oa.21
recent concerns regarding cardiovascular safety of
cox-2 inhibitors—chiefly an increase in thrombotic
events such as myocardial infarction and strokes compared with nsaids, first detected in the vigor
rofecoxib trial28 and later with both celecoxib (the apc
trial) and  xxxd2849xxx / xxxd3481xxx  (coronary bypass surgery trial)—have prompted some debate regarding the
probable mechanisms for cardiovascular aes. one of
the suggested mechanisms is the suppression of endothelial pgi2 production by cox-2 inhibition, while the
generation of txa2 from the platelets remains unaffected.29-31 pgi2 is the major product of endothelial
cyclooxygenases; its production is partly under cox-2
control and has opposite effects to those of txa2, inhibiting platelet aggregation and promoting
vasodilation. selective cox-2 inhibitors may then tip
the homeostatic balance in favor of a higher risk for
thrombotic events. as a cox-2 selective inhibitor,
 xxxd2517xxx  shares in this theoretical risk. an increase
in thrombotic risk may negate, at least to a degree, the
known antithrombotic effects of aspirin that are a consequence of aspirin’s antiplatelet aggregation activity.4,5
this study looked at the effect of  xxxd2517xxx  and
low-dose aspirin on pgi2, as measured by urinary excretion of its metabolites. aspirin has been shown to
dose-dependently inhibit pgi2.32,33 in accordance with
previous data, we found that the low-dose aspirin (75
mg) used in the study did not affect excretion of urinary
pgi2.34,35  xxxd2517xxx  did not have any apparent effect
on urinary pgi2, either with or without concomitant aspirin. this finding is in contrast with results from other
studies with selective cox-2 inhibitors. single doses
of celecoxib 400 or 800 mg and 2 weeks’ treatment with
 xxxd457xxx  twice daily in healthy subjects have
been shown to reduce 2,3-dinor-6-keto pgf1alpha by approximately 80% (p < .01 compared with placebo) and
60% (p < .001 compared with baseline), respectively.29,30 in addition, a 60% reduction in 2,3-dinor-6-

effects of low-dose aspirin and  xxxd2517xxx  in healthy subjects
keto pgf1alpha was also observed following 2 weeks’ treatment with rofecoxib 50 mg od in healthy subjects (p <
.05 compared with baseline).31 the apparent lack of effect on systemic pgi2 levels with  xxxd2517xxx  may, perhaps, be explained by the blood pharmacokinetic profile and kinetics of tissue distribution of  xxxd2517xxx .36
the short plasma elimination half-life (mean 4 hours)19
may limit the duration of exposition of the vascular endothelium, the predominant source of pgi2, to peak
concentrations of  xxxd2517xxx .  xxxd2517xxx  has a
shorter plasma half-life than other cox-2 inhibitors
(22 hours for  xxxd2069xxx ,37 17 hours for rofecoxib,38 11
hours for celecoxib,39 and 8 hours for valdecoxib40). a
long plasma elimination half-life may lead to a sustained inhibition of cox-2-dependent endothelial
prostacyclin production over a 24-hour period, and
this may theoretically lead to greater platelet
aggregability and increased vascular resistance.
further studies are needed to measure plateletendothelial interactions in the setting of  xxxd2517xxx 
treatment and to clarify the effect of  xxxd2517xxx  on
both the 2,3-dinor-6-keto pgf1alpha and 6-keto pgf1alpha metabolites in both healthy subjects and those with oa or
ra, with or without increased risk factors for cardiovascular aes.
accordingly, the target study of  xxxd2517xxx  versus ibuprofen and naproxen (the largest gi outcomes
study in oa to date, with 18,000 patients included)26
showed that there were no significant differences between  xxxd2517xxx  and nsaids for the antiplatelet
trialists’ collaboration (aptc) endpoint (the primary
cardiovascular endpoint). in addition, there was no significant difference in the incidence of the aptc endpoint between  xxxd2517xxx  and nsaids in the population taking low-dose aspirin. this finding agrees with
the results of this study, which suggest that
 xxxd2517xxx  does not interfere with the cox-1-mediated inhibitory effect of low-dose aspirin on platelet
function.
