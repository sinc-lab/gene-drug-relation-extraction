abstract
the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) antagonist,  xxxd3303xxx , on
hemodynamics, myocardial function and myocardial blood flow during the postresuscitation phase in a porcine model of cpr
and to compare these to saline. after 4 min of ventricular fibrillation and 5 min of closed-chest cpr, defibrillation was performed
in 16 domestic pigs to restore spontaneous circulation (rosc). ten minutes after rosc, animals were allocated to receive either
the ang ii antagonist,  xxxd3303xxx , at a dose of 1 mg/kg (n= 8) or saline (n =8). hemodynamics, myocardial function and
myocardial blood flow were measured prearrest and at 5, 30, 90 and 240 min after rosc. using a swan-ganz catheter with a
fast responding-thermistor and a micromanometer tipped catheter, right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, right
ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular contractility were 67 9 6 ml (mean9 s.e.m.), 42 94 ml, 38 9 2%, 2036 9 77 mmhg/s
in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and 8292 ml (p b0.05), 5993 ml (pb 0.01), 289 2% (pb 0.01), 15969 82 mmhg/s (pb 0.01) in the
control group, at 240 min after rosc. no significant differences in mean aortic and pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index or
myocardial blood flow between the two groups were found. we conclude that the ang ii antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  administered
during the postresuscitation phase in pigs increases myocardial contractility without changing cardiac index, systemic vascular
resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, or myocardial perfusion. © 1997 elsevier science ireland ltd.

dothelin and vasopressin in response to cardiac arrest
and cpr is not usually sufficient for restoration of
spontaneous circulation (rosc), so that high dose
administration of exogenous vasopressors is required in
order to raise myocardial perfusion to sufficiently high
levels for rosc [1,2]. however, whereas peripheral
vasoconstriction contributes to resuscitation success
during cpr, neurohormonal activation and myocardial
stunning after rosc may impair myocardial function
and reduce cardiac index during the immediate postresuscitation phase [3–6]. angiotensin converting enzyme
(ace) inhibitors have become a well accepted treatment of congestive heart failure [7] and in patients with

acute myocardial infarction, early treatment with an
ace inhibitor has been shown to improve short-term
and long-term outcome [8]. ace inhibitors have been
found to improve myocardial performance in the reperfusion phase following myocardial ischemia [9] and
ang ii blockade has also been shown to improve
recovery of stunned myocardium [10]. in acute myocardial dysfunction following cardiac arrest and cpr,
however, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system as a
whole has not as yet been evaluated. therefore, the
purpose of this study was to assess myocardial function
and hemodynamic effects of the ang ii antagonist
selective for the  xxxg100xxx  subtype,  xxxd3303xxx 
[11,12], during the immediate postresuscitation phase in
a porcine model of cpr and to compare these to
saline. in particular, the following three questions have
been addressed in this study: (i) does  xxxd3303xxx  reverse
the pressure response to cardiac arrest in the post-resuscitation period? (ii) does  xxxd3303xxx  modify cardiac
contractility in this situation? (iii) are there any adverse
effects on coronary perfusion?

2. methods

2.1. animal preparation
this investigation was approved by the animal protection agency of the state of baden-württemberg,
germany. care and handling of the animals were in
accordance with united states national institutes of
health guidelines. all animals were fasted for 10 h
before surgery, but had free access to water. the animals were premedicated using an intramuscular injection of azaperon (stresnil, 40 mg/ml solution, 4 mg/kg,
janssen, neuss, germany) 30 min before induction of
anesthesia. anasthesia was induced in pigs (male and
female, weighing between 25 and 29 kg, aged 10–12
weeks) by injecting sodium pentobarbital (nembutal,
60 mg/ml solution, 15 mg/kg, sanofi, hannover, germany) into an ear vein, and anesthesia was maintained
by continuous infusion of pentothal 0.5 mg/kg per h.
analgesia was achieved with a bolus dose of buprenorphine (temgesic, 0.3 mg/ml, 0.02 mg/kg, boehringer
mannheim gmbh, mannheim, germany). the animals
were then fixed in the dorsal recumbent position, intubated endotracheally during spontaneous respiration,
and ventilated using a servo ventilator (siemens, erlangen, germany) with 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen at 20
breaths/min, with a tidal volume to maintain normocapnia (paco2 35–40 mmhg).
for monitoring cardiac rhythm, a standard ii electrocardiogram was recorded using three subcutaneous
electrodes. reference blood samples for measurement
of myocardial blood flow were taken from a 7-fr
catheter, which was advanced by femoral cutdown into

the descending aorta. two 7-fr catheters were inserted
via femoral cutdowns in the descending aorta for monitoring of blood pressure and withdrawal of blood
samples. two separate 5-fr catheters in the right
atrium and the inferior caval vein were used for drug
administration. a 7-fr pigtail catheter (cordis medizinische apparate, haan, germany) was advanced under pressure control via femoral cutdown into the left
ventricle in order to inject radiolabelled microspheres
for the measurement of vital organ blood flow. a
7.5-fr pulmonary artery and right ventricular ejection
fraction catheter (model 93a-434-7.5fg, edwards critical-care division, irvine, ca) was placed via left
external jugular vein into pulmonary artery. a micromanometer tipped catheter (micro-tip pc-350, millar,
houston, tx) was placed into the left ventricle via
cutdown of the left carotid artery for measurement of
intraventricular pressure. body temperature (blood
temperature) was recorded from pulmonary artery
catheter and was maintained between 37.5 and 38.5°c
using a heating pad. all catheters were pressure flushed
during the preparation and postresuscitation phase using saline containing 5 u/ml sodium heparin at a rate
of 3 ml/h (intraflow ii, abbott laboratories, north
chicago, ill). in addition during the preparation and
postresuscitation phase, animals received 6 ml/kg/h of
ringer’s solution and a total of 500 ml of a 3% gelatine
solution to replace blood loss due to surgical preparation. normally, infusions were performed at the rates
stated, but when necessary, the infusion rates were
corrected for filling pressures to avoid under- or overloading in individual cases. after completion of surgery
and 10 min before induction of cardiac arrest, oxygen
was increased to 100% and phenobarbital administration was stopped. at the same time, 300 u/kg sodium
heparin was administered intravenously to prevent intracardiac clot formation. at the end of the experiment,
all animals were autopsied to check correct position of
the catheters and to look for damage to the rib cage
and internal organs.

2.2. experimental protocol
before induction of cardiocirculatory arrest, hemodynamic parameters, arterial and venous blood gases, and
vital organ perfusion were measured simultaneously. a
50 hz, 60 v alternating current was applied via two
subcutaneous needle electrodes to induce ventricular
fibrillation. cardiac arrest was confirmed by noting the
typical electrocardiographic rhythm of ventricular
fibrillation and a sudden decrease in aortic pressure
wave-form to zero. ventilation was stopped at this
point. after 4 min of cardiac arrest, manual closedchest cpr was performed at a rate of 80/min. the
compression force was applied to the midsternum
whereas relaxation (decompression) was allowed to oc-

h.-u. strohmenger et al. / resuscitation 35 (1997) 61–68

cur passively. the depth of compression was approximately 25% of the anterior-posterior thorax diameter.
when cardiac massage was begun, ventilation was resumed with 100% oxygen at a respiratory rate of 20
breaths/min and at that tidal volume which had been
determined as resulting in normocapnia before arrest.
cardiac massage was always performed by the same
person.
in a previous animal study, vasopressin has been
shown to be superior to epinephrine with respect to the
percentage of successful resuscitations [13]. regarding
the relative hemodynamic effects of vasopressin (0.4
u/kg) or epinephrine (0.045 mg/kg) administered during cpr, the pressor response during the early postresuscitation phase (i.e. up to 30 min after rosc)
was more pronounced after vasopressin than after
epinephrine, resulting in a significantly higher systemic
vascular resistance and a significantly lower cardiac
index in the vasopressin group. during the remaining
period of observation which lasted for 240 min after
rosc, no significant differences in systemic vascular
resistance or cardiac index were found between the two
groups [14]. therefore after 3 min of cpr, all animals
received 0.4 u/kg vasopressin ( xxxd3495xxx , parke-davis,
freiburg, germany) diluted in 10 ml of physiological
saline given via central venous catheter over a period of
5 s. ninety seconds after vasopressor administration,
we attempted to restore spontaneous circulation with a
dc countershock (lifepak 6 defibrillator, physiocontrol, redmond, washington). three dc countershocks were initially administered at an energy setting
of 3 j/kg. if ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia persisted, the same drug was administered at a
dose of 0.4 u/kg, and closed-chest cpr was reinitiated
for an additional 90 s. three further dc countershocks
(5 j/kg) were then delivered in rapid sequence. the
same protocol (without defibrillation) was used if asystole or pulseless electrical activity developed. when,
after successful defibrillation further defibrillation was
necessary because of recurrence of ventricular fibrillation, the energy level of this repeated shock was the
same as the initially successful shock. sustained ventricular dysrhythmias were treated by injecting lidocaine
( xxxd2482xxx , 20 mg/ml, astra chemicals gmbh, wedel,
germany) at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg. restoration of
spontaneous circulation (rosc) was defined as coordinated electrical activity and a systolic blood pressure
\90 mm hg for at least 5 min, during which no
further resuscitation measures were necessary. the period of the postresuscitation phase was measured from
that point in time onwards.
ten minutes after rosc, animals were assigned to
receive either a 1 mg/kg bolus of  xxxd3303xxx  (dr karl
thomae, biberach an der riß, germany) diluted in 10
ml of physiologic saline followed by a continuous infusion of  xxxd3303xxx  at a dosage of 30 mg/kg/h or

63

placebo (10 ml bolus of saline followed by a continuous
infusion of saline).  xxxd3303xxx  is a competitive, selective inhibitor of the ang ii receptor subtype 1 and has
no agonistic properties [7,8]. in preliminary experiments, the dosage chosen has been found to perform
insuperable antagonism of ang ii induced cardiovascular effects. the time-delay between onset of ventricular fibrillation and restoration of spontaneous
circulation may be more important to the activation of
the renin–angiotensin system and therefore in this experimental setting, the drug may have been administered after the peak of any ang ii on coronary
circulation. however during cpr, adequate coronary
perfusion pressure due to increased vascular resistance
is crucial for rosc and therefore at that point in time,
administration of an ang ii antagonist may be detrimental for resuscitation success. the animals were allocated to drug treatment by random numbers and all
investigators were blinded.
at the beginning of the postresuscitation phase, anasthesia was resumed by continuous infusion of pentobarbital at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg per min and a further bolus
dose of buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg). no other drugs
were given during the postresuscitation period.

2.3. measurements
heart rate was recorded from the signal of standard
ecg. pressures were continuously measured from the
aorta, right atrium and pulmonary artery using a multichannel recorder (hewlett packard 7758, böblingen,
germany) with calibrated pressure transducers (model
1290a, hewlett packard, boeblingen, germany) and
zero established to atmospheric pressure at the level of
the right atrium. using an ejection fraction cardiac
output computer (ref/1, baxter edwards critical
care, irvine, ca), cardiac output, right ventricular
ejection fraction, right ventricular end-systolic and enddiastolic volume were determined in triplicate by the
thermodilution technique (5 ml of iced saline injected
into the right atrium) prearrest and at 5, 30, 90 and 240
min after rosc (i.e. at 5 min before and at 20, 80 and
230 min after drug administration).
left ventricular intracavity pressures were continuously measured with a micromanometer tipped catheter
which was coupled to a monitor-recorder unit provided
with a contractility module and a non-commercially
available software package (adas system, dr karl
thomae, biberach, germany). left ventricular systolic
and end-diastolic pressure, the rate of left ventricular
pressure development (dp/dt), the negative deflection
of this curve as a measure for left ventricular relaxation
(− dp/dt) were recorded simultaneously. left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, dp/dt and −dp/dt were
evaluated prearrest and 5, 30, 90, and 240 min after
rosc. at the end of the experiment, heart rate, mean

64

h.-u. strohmenger et al. / resuscitation 35 (1997) 61–68

arterial and pulmonary arterial pressure, left ventricular
contractility and cardiac index were evaluated at 2, 5
and 10 min after ang ii administration. cardiac
index, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance were
calculated using standard formulas.
arterial and mixed venous blood gases, haemoglobin
content and oxygen saturation were measured with a
blood gas analyzer (radiometer, abl 330, copenhagen, denmark) and corrected for temperature.
vital organ perfusion was measured using radiolabelled microspheres according to the technique as previously described [15]. organ blood flow was measured in
this study at 15 min before induction of ventricular
fibrillation and at 5, 30, 90 and 240 min after rosc.
microspheres (new england nuclear, dreieich, germany) with a mean diameter of 159 1.5 mm and
specific activity of 10 mci/g were used. the microspheres were labelled with 141cereum, 95niobium,
103
ruthenium, 46scandium and 85strontium. before injection, the microsphere vial was placed in an ultrasonically vibrated water bath for 1 min. approximately
5× 105 microspheres diluted in 10 ml of saline were
then immediately injected into the left ventricle. with
the use of an automatic withdrawal pump (braun,
melsungen, germany), blood was continuously withdrawn over a period of 2 min from the catheter lying in
the descending aorta at a rate of 6 ml/min over a period
of 2 min. at the end of the experiment, the entire heart
was removed. the left ventricular wall was sectioned
into three layers. aliquots of right ventricular, left
ventricular and septal tissue were weighted, homogenized and then placed into vials. the radioactivity of
the blood collected, which served as a reference organ,
was measured with a gamma scintillation spectrometer
(lb 5300, berthold, wildbad, germany) as was the
radioactivity in the homogenized tissues.

stored because a complete atrioventricular block which
occurred after the sixth defibrillation attempt. this
animal was excluded from the study. in all animals of
both groups, a single dose of 0.4 u/kg vasopressin was
sufficient for restoration of spontaneous circulation,
and in all animals, the first countershock was performed after 8.5 min of cardiac arrest. repeated countershocks, because of recurrence of ventricular
fibrillation, were necessary in six animals of the
 xxxd3303xxx  group and in six animals of the placebo
group. it was necessary to give 3.5 9 0.7 shocks/animal
(mean9 s.e.m.) in the  xxxd3303xxx  group and 2.190.3
shocks/animal in the placebo group (p= 0.2075), respectively. the total lidocaine doses in the  xxxd3303xxx 
group and the placebo group were 509 9 and 5097
mg, respectively (p= 0.8748).
hemodynamic variables prearrest and during the
postresuscitation phase are shown in table 1. at 240
min after rosc, left ventricular contractility and right
ventricular ejection fraction were significantly higher,
right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume
were significantly lower in the  xxxd3303xxx  group in
comparison to the control group. in all the other
hemodynamic variables shown in table 1, no clinically
important differences were found between the two
groups.
at no point in time, either prearrest or during the
postresuscitation phase, was there a clinically important
difference found between the two groups with respect
to haemoglobin or arterial or mixed venous blood
gases.
at no point, either prearrest or during the postresuscitation phase, was there significant differences found
between the two groups with respect to left ventricular
or right myocardial blood flow or to the endocardial/
epicardial ratio of myocardial perfusion (table 2).

2.4. statistical analysis
4. discussion
values are expressed as mean9s.e.m. statistical
analysis was carried out using the statistika™
software package, release 4.5 (statsoft, tulsa, ok).
because data did not satisfy the assumption of approximate equality of variance of sample distribution,
mann-whitney u test (two-tailed) was performed to
determine differences between the  xxxd3303xxx  and the
control groups. for multiple comparisons within one
group, the bonferroni method was applied. statistical
significance was considered to be at the p b 0.05 level.

3. results
in 16 of the 17 animals included in this investigation
the whole protocol could be performed as planned. in
one animal, spontaneous circulation could not be re-

results of this study demonstrate that during the
postresuscitation phase in pigs, administration of the
ang ii antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  results in an improvement of both left and right ventricular function without
changing myocardial perfusion, cardiac output, pulmonary or peripheral vascular resistance in comparison
to saline.
activation of the renin-angiotensin-system can be
regarded as part of the neuroendocrine response to
hypotension in order to maintain normal organ perfusion. major factors stimulating the release of renin are
renal hypoperfusion and renal b-receptor stimulation
via baroreceptor activation and increased sympathetic
adrenergic discharge [16]. ang ii enhances sympathetic reflex activity [17] and promotes the secretion of
aldosterone and vasopressin [18]. because of the

tremendous neuroendocrine activation during cardiac
arrest, vasopressor levels including those of the reninangiotensin-system are still elevated during the immediate postresuscitation phase [19 – 21]. impaired myocardial function as part of the postresuscitation syndrome has been described earlier [5,6]. by increasing
cardiac afterload, high ang ii levels may contribute to
the aggravation of heart failure [22]. in patients with
congestive heart failure, it has been shown that the
degree of neuroendocrine activation is an important
prognostic factor for long-term survival. furthermore,
the beneficial effect of ace-inhibitors in reducing mortality was confined to the patients with the most extensive hormonal activation including ang ii and
norepinephrine [23,24].
in several studies, ace inhibition has been investigated during the very early stage of acute myocardial

infarction, but the beneficial effects are controversial
[8,25,26]. during acute myocardial dysfunction in the
immediate postresuscitation phase, however, blockade
of the renin-angiotensin-system has not been investigated. the results from our study show that administration of an ang ii antagonist results in an
improvement of both left and right ventricular function
without changing cardiac output or vascular resistance.
these findings suggest that in this model of postresuscitation heart failure, ang ii antagonism improves
global cardiac performance via effects on myocardial
function rather than by afterload reduction. since pulmonary artery pressure is comparable in the two treatment groups, the decrease in right ventricular
end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes in the  xxxd3303xxx  may be secondary to increased myocardial contractility rather than to an influence on ventricular load.

in addition to the endocrine ang ii formation in
the vascular endothelium, which is presumed to provide
short-term cardiovascular homeostasis, paracrine tissue
renin –angiotensin-system seems to play an important
role in the local control of vascular resistance and has
tissue specific functions, particularly in the heart [27].
besides its positive chronotropic and inotropic effects
[28 – 30], ang ii is thought to cause coronary vasoconstriction [31] and necrosis of cardiac tissue [32]. these
effects of ang ii have been shown to be mediated via
the ang ii receptor subtype 1, whereas the function of
the subtype 2 binding site is not yet known [33]. cardiac ace activity or ang ii formation have been
reported to correlate with the degree of myocardial
dysfunction [34,35] and to increase after myocardial
infarction [36]. blockade of the renin-angiotensin-system by ace inhibitors has been shown to increase
coronary blood flow and to improve global myocardial
performance in the reperfusion phase following myocardial ischemia [9]. however, the beneficial effects of
ace inhibition have in part been attributed to the
increased formation of  xxxd2738xxx  and prostacyclin via
decreased bradykinin metabolism [37 – 39], and a part
of the conversion  xxxg99xxx  to ang ii may occur
independently of ace via a chymase [40,41]. ang ii
blockade has also been shown to be effective in improving recovery of stunned myocardium [10]. the results of
our study support these observations and show that
during the immediate postresuscitation in pigs, early
blockade of the renin – angiotensin-system by ang ii
antagonism results in a significant improvement in myocardial function without causing hypotension and thus
threatening myocardial perfusion. in particular, in the
face of the isolated changes in myocardial contractility
without affecting myocardial blood flow, heart rate or

blood pressure, an effect of ang ii antagonism at the
cellular level needs to be taken into consideration.
further studies will be needed, however, to determine
whether the initiation of renin-angiotensin-blockade at
this early state of myocardial dysfunction can prevent
the development of congestive heart failure and improve long-term survival.
this study has some limitations which should be
commented on. firstly, this animal model has not been
conclusively demonstrated to be predictive of clinical
studies. it is an experimental model with healthy animals, and short arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation times was used. preexisting coronary
atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction or impaired myocardial function, long lasting myocardial hypoxia and
the need for higher vasopressor doses after prolonged
arrest times may cause a more pronounced cardiovascular dysfunction after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
in addition, investigation of perfusion and function of
other organ systems such as gut, liver and kidney are
necessary in order to evaluate the effects of ang ii
antagonism during the postresuscitation phase more
completely. secondly, it is open to question, why the
differences in right ventricular volume and left ventricular contractile function differ between groups only at
the 240 min time point. one possible reason could be
that myocardial function (i.e. dp/dt) of the  xxxd3303xxx 
group improves with time, but that the p-value does
not reach statistical significance until the 240 min point
of observation. on the other hand, it cannot be excluded that despite the strictly standardized study protocol, some unspecific factors such as cumulative effects
of the anesthetics or differences in loading conditions
may have adversely affected the control group and the
 xxxd3303xxx  group. thirdly, myocardial perfusion vari-

h.-u. strohmenger et al. / resuscitation 35 (1997) 61–68

ables show a trend towards reduced myocardial blood
flow at most time points following  xxxd3303xxx , but the
between-group p-values for these variables to indicate
the between-group differences are not statistically different. nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that with
only eight animals in each group, this study may not
have the statistical power to uncover a difference. this
would be a very important factor when translated to
the clinical setting of cardiac arrest in the context of
acute myocardial ischemia or infarction.
we conclude that during the postresuscitation phase
in pigs, administration of the ang ii antagonist
 xxxd3303xxx  improves myocardial contractility without
significantly changing myocardial perfusion, cardiac
output or vascular resistance.
