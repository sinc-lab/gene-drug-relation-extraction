background & aims: the pathogenesis of nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drug–induced enteropathy is controversial, but it is thought that  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1)
inhibition is of pivotal importance. we compared small
intestinal function and morphology in untreated wildtype, cox-1– and cox-2– deﬁcient mice and the effect of
indomethacin, selective cox-1 (sc-560), and cox-2
(celecoxib) inhibition. methods: intestinal permeability
(51credta), inﬂammation (fecal granulocyte marker protein),  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) levels, and macroscopic
and microscopic appearances were assessed at baseline and after the drugs. results: cox-1ⴚ/ⴚ animals were
normal except for a 97% decrease in intestinal pge2
levels. cox-1ⴙ/ⴙ and cox-1ⴚ/ⴚ animals reacted in a
similar way to indomethacin. however, celecoxib, having
caused no damage in cox-1ⴙ/ⴙ animals, caused small
bowel ulcers in cox-1ⴚ/ⴚ animals. selective inhibition of
cox-1 decreased intestinal pge2 levels in cox-2ⴙ/ⴙ and
cox-2ⴚ/ⴚ animals by 95%–97%, but caused only small
bowel ulcers in the latter group. dual inhibition of cox-1
and cox-2 in wild-type animals resulted in similar small
bowel damage. between 40% and 50% of untreated
cox-2ⴚ/ⴚ animals had increased intestinal permeability
and inﬂammation. some had ileal ulcers that were distinctively different from indomethacin-induced ulcers.
furthermore, long-term celecoxib administration in wildtype animals was associated with similar damage as in
the cox-2ⴚ/ⴚ mice. conclusions: cox-1 deﬁciency or
inhibition and short-term cox-2 inhibition are compatible with normal small intestinal integrity. dual inhibition
of the cox enzymes leads to damage similar to that
seen with indomethacin. long-term cox-2 deﬁciency or
inhibition is associated with signiﬁcant intestinal pathology despite normal intestinal pge2 levels, suggesting a
role for cox-2 in the maintenance of small intestinal
integrity in the mouse.

spirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (nsaids) are widely used for their analgesic
and anti-inflammatory properties, for cardiovascular prophylaxis, and for their antineoplastic actions on colonic

a

polyps and carcinomas.1 the main problem with these
drugs is the high prevalence and severity of gastrointestinal damage.2 nsaid gastropathy with its attendant
complications accounts for significant morbidity and
mortality.3 furthermore, 50%–70% of patients on longterm nsaid therapy develop nsaid enteropathy. this
enteropathy is not usually associated with life-threatening events, but may lead to management problems associated with bleeding, protein loss, ulcers, and strictures.4
the pathogenesis of nsaid-induced gastrointestinal
damage is controversial.4 – 6 there has been a general
consensus that inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1)
is the pivotal event for the gastric damage.7,8 this idea
was partially endorsed by the clinical experience with
selective inhibitors of cox-2, celecoxib and rofecoxib.
these drugs have equal efficacy to conventional nsaids
and greatly improve gastric tolerability, as assessed by
short-term9 or long-term10,11 endoscopy studies and as
serious outcomes.12,13 however, it is not clear whether
this enhanced tolerability is due solely to selectivity for
the cox-2 enzyme or to the absence of the “topical”
effect, which plays a pathogenic role in nsaid-induced
damage in the stomach4 – 6,14 –20 and the small bowel.21,22
recent work has shown that cox-1– deficient (cox1⫺/⫺) mice do not spontaneously develop gastric damage.23 this lack of damage is difficult to reconcile with
prevailing theories on the central importance of cox-1
inhibition in the pathogenesis of nsaid-induced gastrointestinal damage.6,7,24 these apparently contradictory findings have suggested to some workers that there
must be some compensatory processes that counteract the
effect of mucosal prostaglandin deficiency in the coxabbreviations used in this paper: cox-1,  xxxg1883xxx ; elisa,

1⫺/⫺ mice, such as up-regulation of cox-2 or nitric
oxide synthase.25,26 importantly, wallace et al27 showed
that short-term and selective cox-1 inhibition does not
lead to gastric damage in the rat; rather, dual inhibition
of both the cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes, in the absence
of the “topical” effect, is needed to cause gastric damage.
the pathogenesis of gastric and small bowel damage
from nsaids differs in many respects.4,6 in particular,
small bowel damage is less dependent on cox-1 inhibition than is gastric damage.5 our purpose was to
establish a mouse model of indomethacin-induced small
bowel damage and to characterize and compare small
intestinal morphology and function (i.e., intestinal  xxxd1903xxx  [pge2] levels, intestinal permeability, and
inflammation) in wild-type, cox-1–, and cox-2– deficient mice. we assessed the effects of short-term selective cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition on wild-type and
cox-1– and cox-2– deficient mice and the long-term
effects of cox-2 deficiency or inhibition.

materials and methods
animals and drugs
the generation of cox-1⫺/⫺ and cox-2⫺/⫺ mice
used in these experiments has been described in detail previously.23,28 all of the animals were bred and maintained at our
facility. mice from wild-type/wild-type, heterozygous/heterozygous, and homozygous (male)/heterozygous (female) matings were used for the experiments after being genotyped by
polymerase chain reaction of tail dna. the cox-1⫺/⫺ and
cox-2⫺/⫺ mice were bred on pure c57bl/b6 and mixed 129
and c57bl/b6 mouse strain backgrounds, respectively. the
mice were studied at 8 –24 weeks of age unless otherwise
stated, weighing 18 –25 g. wild-type animals were studied at
the same age and weight, and where comparisons between
wild-type and deficient mice were carried out, animals were
matched for age, sex, and genetic background. preliminary
studies showed no gender differences in the parameters studied. the u.k. home office and the local animal ethical
committee approved these studies.
the drugs used in the experiments were indomethacin, an
acidic dual inhibitor of the cox enzymes used widely in
gastrointestinal toxicity studies29; sc-560, a selective nonacidic cox-1 inhibitor30; and celecoxib, a selective nonacidic
cox-2 inhibitor.31 all of the drugs were initially dissolved in
100% dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and then diluted so that the
final concentration of dmso was less than 10%. control
experiments used the same dmso concentration.
surgery (laparotomy) was performed under anesthesia with
inhalation halothane (3.5%) at constant temperature unless
otherwise stated.

intestinal prostanoid levels
samples for pge2 assessment were collected 3 hours
after gastric gavage with vehicle or study drugs given at 8 am.

tissue sampling. the abdomen was opened by a
midline incision under anesthesia. a small incision was made
in the duodenum, and the gut was flushed with subzero 0.9%
saline after the ileum was cut at the ileocecal valve. the whole
of the small intestine was then quickly removed from the
animal and placed on a plastic film sitting on ice. between 2
and 3 cm were trimmed from both the proximal and distal
ends of the gut, and the remaining saline was gently squeezed
out from the gut before it was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
the intestines were then transferred to cryogen tubes, precooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ⫺80°c until pge2
extraction was done.
homogenization. the gut samples were ground in
liquid nitrogen using pestle and mortar. roughly 100 mg of
the pulverized sample was weighed into a microcentrifuge
tube, precooled in liquid nitrogen, with care taken to not allow
the samples to thaw. the samples were then put back into
liquid nitrogen and maintained at ⫺80°c until extraction.
extraction. in this step, 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer
containing cox inhibitor (50 mmol/l phosphate [ph 7.4], 1
mmol/l edta, 90 mol/l indomethacin) was added to the
tubes containing the frozen samples, sitting on ice. samples
were vortexed briefly and left for 15 minutes, sitting on ice.
purification of the samples was performed according to a
protocol provided with the pge2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kit used for sample quantification (biotrac
pge2 enzyme immunoassay; amersham, buckinghamshire,
england). briefly, pge2 was extracted with amprep c18
columns, eluted with ethyl acetate, and dried under nitrogen.
samples were reconstituted in 0.5 ml of assay buffer (supplied
with the elisa kit) just before the pge2 elisa was run.
the kit’s elisa protocol was followed precisely, and the
optical density was read at 450 nm within 30 minutes using a
microplate reader model x ( xxxg22xxx ) elisa plate reader fitted
with dynex revelation software, version 3.2 (dynex technologies, chantilly, va). this kit’s lowest reliable limit of pge2
detection is 20 pg/ml. the lowest pge2 measurement in this
study was 1.4 pg/mg of tissue, equivalent to 70 pg/ml, or
approximately 4 times above the detection limit and well
within the functional part of the standard curve of the assay.

intestinal permeability
51credta was used as a marker for assessing intestinal
paracellular permeability.32,33 one hour after administration of
the drug or solvent, mice received 1 ␮ci 51credta in a
volume of 100 ␮l of water (containing approximately 5 nmol
51credta; amersham buckinghamshire, england) by gastric
gavage followed by another 100 ␮l of water. the mice were
housed in individual metabolic cages. all urine passed over the
next 24 hours was collected. the urine samples were counted
along with standards (10 ␮l of stock solution, i.e., 10% of the
dose given) in a wallac 1284 gamma counter (pharmacia,
sweden) for 1 minute, allowing detection of less than 0.01% of
the dose administered. results are presented as percentage of
the oral dose excreted in urine.

intestinal inﬂammation
granulocyte marker protein (gmp) is a 70-kilodalton
protein isolated from rat neutrophils. gmp is stable and not
significantly degraded for at least 1 week at room temperature.
gmp isolated from feces has been shown to be a sensitive,
noninvasive marker of gastrointestinal inflammation in the
rat.22,34
preliminary experiments showed a cross-reactivity between
fecal gmp of rats and mice. complete daily fecal collections
for gmp assessment were made from mice housed in individual metabolic cages. collections were made for 5 days before
gavage with vehicle or drug and were continued for a few days
afterward. stool samples were maintained at ⬃20°c until
homogenized in homogenizing buffer (tris 50 mmol/l, nacl
150 mmol/l, cacl2 10 mmol/l, and thiomersal 0.25 mmol/l,
ph to 8.4; volume 4 times the weight of each sample) using an
ultra turrax homogenizer (ike werke, staufen, germany) for
30 seconds  xxxd1891xxx ,000g. a sample of the homogenate was
transferred to a microcentrifuge and spun  xxxd1891xxx ,000g for 10
minutes. the top half of the supernatant was then transferred
to a new tube and stored at ⬃20°c until quantitation by
elisa.
microtiter plates (maxisorp f96; nunc immunoplate,
nunc, denmark) were coated by adding 200 ␮l of anti-gmp
immunoglobulin g (igg) fraction diluted (1:2000) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25 mmol/l thiomersal to
each well. the plates were covered with mylar foil and maintained at ⫹4°c until use. plates were washed 4 times with
washing buffer (tris 50 mmol/l, nacl 150 mmol/l, mgcl2
0.5 mmol/l, kcl 2.5 mmol/l, thiomersal 0.25 mmol/l, and
tween-20 0.05%, ph to 8.0) before use. gmp standards,
5–320 mg/l, were prepared by diluting purified gmp (28
g/ml in assay buffer (tris 50 mmol/l, nacl 150 mmol/l,
mgcl2 0.5 mmol/l, kcl 2.5 mmol/l, thiomersal 0.25
mmol/l, tween-20 0.05%, and bovine  xxxg124xxx  1%,
ph to 8.0). the frozen fecal extracts were thawed and diluted
to 1:20 and 1:200 (with further dilutions made if required).
next, 50 ␮l of standards and diluted samples (1:200) were
added to the plate (in duplicates), then covered and incubated
at room temperature for 45 minutes on a plate shaker with an
agitating speed of 600/minute. each well was then washed 4
times with washing buffer using an automatic plate washer.
then 50 ␮l of alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-gmp
antibody diluted (1:800) in assay buffer was added to each well
and incubated again at room temperature for 45 minutes at the
same agitating speed. thereafter the wells were washed 4 times
and 100 ␮l of substrate ( xxxd2822xxx  [1 mg/ml]
in substrate buffer [10% diethanolamine, 0.5 mmol/l mgcl2 ,
0.25 mmol/l thiomersal, ph 9.6]) was added to each well.
using a wavelength of 405 nm on an elisa plate reader
( xxxg22xxx  plate reader plus dynex revelation software, version
3.2), the optical density of the highest standard was monitored
until it read between 1.2 and 1.8. then the reaction was
stopped with 100 ␮l of 1 mol/l naoh solution, and the plate
was read. the intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation

were 13% and 10%, respectively. results are expressed as fecal
concentrations of gmp (mg/l).

morphologic studies
for the macroscopic assessment, the animals underwent anesthesia and laparotomy. when the stomach was examined, it was removed and opened by a cut along the greater
curvature. the whole of the small intestine was removed and
flushed with 0.9% saline without overdistension and everted
with the aid of a plastic tube. the intestine was then incubated
in a 16 mmol/l hepes buffer containing 125 mmol/l nacl,
3.5 mmol/l kcl, 10 mmol/l glucose, and 1 mmol/l nitroblue
tetrazolium for 20 minutes. nitroblue tetrazolium facilitates
the detection of intestinal mucosal damage by staining the villi
surrounding erosions and ulcers. the intestine was then examined under 10⫻ magnification with a leica gz6 stereomicroscope (leica, deerfield, il) for ulcer counts. preliminary studies had shown that the smallest detectable lesions identified
after nsaid administration without staining with nitroblue
tetrazolium were about 1–2 mm. by staining the intestinal
tissue, we were able to reliably detect lesions of 0.1 mm and
larger, which was used to define the smallest lesion included in
the ulcer count. the histopathologic correlates of these smaller
lesions are erosion, because they do not usually penetrate the
muscular layer. our ulcer count is therefore a combination of
erosions and ulcers, because strictly, the latter can be verified
only microscopically.
separate animals underwent anesthesia and laparotomy with
removal of the entire intestine (stomach and small and large
intestine) for histopathologic study. the small bowel was first
perfused with formalin through a duodenal incision and immersion-fixed overnight. when examined, the stomach and
colon were immersion-fixed. the whole of alternative 2-cm
segments of intestine (stomach and colon) was cut into 1- to
2-mm segments and embedded in paraffin for the preparation
of 3 ␮m h&e–stained sections. a total of about 60 small
intestinal sections from each animal were assessed for histologic damage.35,36

 xxxd2738xxx  products
measurement of nitrate and nitrite was performed in
serum, 3 24-hour mouse urines, and incubation medium using
a modified greiss method.37 jejunal tissue was obtained from
anesthetized animals and incubated in an oxygenated hepes
buffer for 5 minutes. the tissue was removed and weighed
while the medium was stored before assay for  xxxd2738xxx 
products.

statistics
results are presented as mean ⫾ standard deviation.
most, but not all, of the data were normally distributed.
statistical differences between groups of animals were therefore
assessed by wilcoxon rank sum test. sequential data were
assessed with the paired student t test using bonferroni’s
correction and correlations with pearson’s correlation coefficient.

together during the studies, we examined 54 untreated
(apart from solvent) cox-1⫺/⫺ animals for small bowel
ulceration, including 12 animals 18 months of age. none
of these were found to have any small bowel pathology,
and none died unexpectedly.
table 1 and figure 1 show that cox-1⫺/⫺ animals
have normal intestinal permeability and no increased
inflammation, with intestinal pge2 levels only 3% of
those of the control mice (p ⬍ 0.001) and unaffected by
solvent. the low pge2 levels in cox-1⫺/⫺ mice argue
against intestinal up-regulation of cox-2 as a compensatory mechanism to account for the lack of spontaneous
small bowel damage. another common hypothesis to
explain this lack of damage proposes up-regulation of
intestinal  xxxd2738xxx  synthase.25,26 this hypothesis was
tested, but table 1 reveals no significant differences
between the products (nitrite and nitrate) of  xxxd2738xxx

wild-type animals, with 11 (40%) of these animals having values above the normal range. there were no significant correlations (p ⬎ 0.05) between age and intestinal permeability (r ⫽ 0.19) or inflammation (r ⫽ 0.29)
in the cox-2⫺/⫺ animals.
during the studies, 8 of 56 (14%) untreated cox2⫺/⫺ animals died suddenly or were killed because of
distress. all had peritoneal sepsis with small bowel adhesions. macroscopically, there was evidence of small
bowel perforation, and microscopy showed areas of
chronic multifocal mucosal necrosis and ulceration in the
last few centimeters of the ileum (stomach and colon
were normal).
more groups of untreated cox-2⫺/⫺ animals were
studied to assess the relationship between intestinal

pge2 level, inflammation, and intestinal morphology.
six animals with high fecal gmp values (15– 68 mg/l)
had intestinal pge2 levels not significantly different than
those in wild-type animals (94 ⫾ 13% of control levels).
further groups were selected on the basis of normal (n ⫽
8) and high fecal gmp (⬎15 mg/l; n ⫽ 12) at age 8 –52
weeks. none of the animals with a normal gmp showed
any evidence of morphologic damage, whereas 2 of the 3
animals with fecal gmp concentrations above 50 mg/l
had microscopically detected small ulcers in the terminal
ileum that were identical to those found in the distressed
animals and the animals that died unexpectedly.
finally, cox-2⫹/⫹ mice (n ⫽ 13) were given 100
mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 d⫺1 of celecoxib orally for 3 months mixed
with their food. during the studies, 3 animals died
suddenly or were killed due to distress (after 6 –10 weeks
of treatment). all 3, plus 2 of those killed at the end of
this study, had lesions identical to those described in the
cox-2⫺/⫺ animals. collectively, all of the lesions in the
untreated cox-2⫺/⫺ animals and the cox-2⫹/⫹ animals receiving celecoxib were located on the mesenteric
side of the intestine, and they differ from the acute
indomethacin-induced lesions (representative histology
shown in figure 4) in 4 respects.
first, the lesions in the cox-2⫺/⫺ and cox-2⫹/⫹
animals treated with celecoxib long-term are confined to
the terminal ileum, whereas the lesions seen with lowdose indomethacin (2.0 mg/kg) are located mainly in the
mid to small intestine, spreading proximally and distally
at higher doses. second, the terminal ileal ulcers associated with cox-2 deficiency and inhibition do not stain
with nitroblue tetrazolium and are difficult to detect
macroscopically. third, there is a lower preponderance
(n ⫽ 1–3) of ulcers in the celecoxib-treated and cox2⫺/⫺ animals than in the indomethacin-treated ones

june 2002

(apart from at the 2.0-mg/kg dose). finally, there is a
dominance of chronic (rather than acute) inflammatory
cells seen microscopically in the spontaneous lesions
found in the cox-2⫺/⫺ and wild-type animals treated
with celecoxib, whereas the indomethacin-induced ulcers
have an acute appearance (figure 4).
effect of indomethacin and sc-560 on intestinal
pge2 and ulcers in cox-2ⴙ/ⴙ and cox-2ⴚ/ⴚ animals.

figure 1 shows that the solvent had no significant effect
on intestinal pge2 levels, whereas single doses of indomethacin (3.75 mg/kg) decreased intestinal pge2 levels
in the cox-2⫹/⫹ and cox-2⫺/⫺ mice significantly (p ⬍
0.001) and equally. these pge2 levels were not significantly (p ⬎ 0.9) different than those seen in the indomethacin (3.75 mg/kg) treated cox-1⫹/⫹ and untreated
cox-1⫺/⫺ mice. however, at this dose of indomethacin,
the cox-2⫹/⫹ mice (n ⫽ 16) developed significantly
(p ⬍ 0.05) fewer small intestinal ulcers (14 ⫾ 3) than
the cox-1⫹/⫹ mice (26 ⫾ 4). the cox-2⫺/⫺ mice (n ⫽
16) developed significantly (p ⬍ 0.01) more ulcers with
indomethacin than their cox-2⫹/⫹ controls, the converse of what was seen in the cox-1⫹/⫹ and cox-1⫺/⫺
animals.
figure 1 shows that single doses of the selective,
nonacidic cox-1 inhibitor sc-560 (30 mg/kg; n ⫽
4 – 6/group) decreased intestinal pge2 significantly (by
96%–97%; p ⬍ 0.001) from control levels in the cox2⫹/⫹ and cox-2⫺/⫺ animals. however, although no
macroscopic or microscopic damage was seen with sc560 administration in the cox-2⫹/⫹ animals, the drug
caused significant ulcerative (p ⬍ 0.001) damage to the
small bowel in the cox-2⫺/⫺ animals. the location and
histopathologic appearance of these ulcers were identical
to those seen with indomethacin.
dual inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 in wild-type
animals. the foregoing suggests, but does not provide

conclusive proof, that inhibition of both the cox-1 and
cox-2 enzymes in the short term leads to small intestinal ulcers resembling those seen with indomethacin.
thus cox-2⫹/⫹ mice (n ⫽ 4) were given single doses of
5 mg/kg sc-560 and 30 mg/kg celecoxib, neither of
which causes damage in wild-type animals when administered alone at these doses. small intestinal ulcer counts
24 hours later showed 23⫾2 ulcers with the same macroscopic and microscopic appearance and location as indomethacin-induced ulcers.

discussion
nsaid-induced gastrointestinal damage is a
complex, multistep pathogenic event. in theory, the
initial damaging event is dependent on one or more

pathogenesis of nsaid-enteropathy

1919

biochemical action(s) shared by all conventional
nsaids, namely inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 and
the “topical” effects. it has been suggested that because
of these biochemical actions, a number of interacting
pathophysiologic events follow, including recruitment of
neutrophils and other cells involved in the inflammatory
cascade, ischemia, villus contraction, and so on. these
events constitute the host response to the initial damage
and eventually lead to the characteristic gastrointestinal
inflammation, ulcers.
the relative importance and contribution of the initial
biochemical actions of conventional nsaids in the
stomach and small bowel may differ. in particular, it has
been suggested that the small bowel damage is less
dependent on cox-1 inhibition than the stomach.5 furthermore, the pathophysiology of the damage differs
significantly at the 2 sites because of the participation of
luminal factors in the tissue damage. the importance of
elucidating the pathogenesis of nsaid-induced gastrointestinal damage is that such knowledge might lead to
measures to reduce the frequency and severity of these
drugs’ gastrointestinal side effects.2,4,5 although the secondary host and luminal factors can be modified to
decrease the damage, optimally a therapeutic measure to
minimize nsaid toxicity would be directed against a
drug action that initiates the damage.
the gastric damage caused by nsaids has been studied in greater detail than the small bowel damage because the clinical consequences of gastric ulcer bleeds and
perforations in humans are common and may be lifethreatening.38,39 it is possible to cause gastric damage in
the rat through dual inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2,27
and there are pervasive data to suggest that the “topical”
effect may also play a role.15,16,18,19,40
in this study, we used genetically modified mice to
assess the long-term effect of cox-1 and cox-2 deficiency on the small intestine and the role of the 2
enzymes in acute damage, using sc-560 and celecoxib,
neither of which has a “topical” effect.41 our results
expand on previous studies that concentrated largely on
gastric integrity23 to show that long-term deficiency of
cox-1 deficiency is not associated with a disrupted
small intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation,
or ulcers. moreover, we have shown that short-term
selective cox-1 inhibition with sc-560 in wild-type
animals does not cause small intestinal damage despite
decreasing intestinal pge2 to levels seen at ulcerogenic
doses of indomethacin. these results argue against the
idea that cox-1 inhibition is the sole mechanism underlying the small intestinal toxicity of nsaids and are
in keeping with similar studies in the stomach.27 fur-

sigthorsson et al.

thermore, our results show that up-regulation of intestinal  xxxd2738xxx  synthase, a commonly postulated mechanism,25,26 does not explain the lack of damage in the
face of the low pge2 levels.
the alterations in small intestine permeability and
inflammation and the location and histopathologic features of the damage caused by indomethacin in mice
were almost identical to those seen in rats.22,36 the
effects of indomethacin on these parameters did not differ
significantly between the cox-1⫹/⫹ and cox-1⫺/⫺ animals, except the latter were less susceptible to the
ulcerative damage at the lower dosage range (2.0 and
3.75 mg/kg) of indomethacin. in the stomach, a similar
reduced susceptibility to the damaging effect of indomethacin was seen at the 10-mg/kg dose, with the
20-mg/kg dose associated with equal damage in wildtype and cox-1⫺/⫺ animals.23
untreated cox-1⫺/⫺ animals and wild-type animals
receiving indomethacin (3.75 and 15 mg/kg) and sc560 all had similarly low intestinal pge2 levels. however, the degree of small bowel damage differed, suggesting that concomitant inhibition of cox-2 and/or
the topical effect is important in the pathogenesis of
small bowel damage. the former possibility was studied
further. single doses of celecoxib did not affect intestinal
pge2 levels or cause damage in wild-type animals, in
keeping with similar studies in rats.42,43 however, celecoxib caused significant small bowel damage with a
further 50% decrease (30 and 300 mg/kg) in the already
low intestinal pge2 levels of the cox-1⫺/⫺ animals.
the mechanism by which short-term cox-2 inhibition
leads to small bowel damage in cox-1⫺/⫺ mice is
uncertain, because no significant cox-2 mrna signal
was detected in the intestine of cox-1⫺/⫺ mice.23,44
having demonstrated that cox-2 inhibition is detrimental in cox-1⫺/⫺ animals, we proceeded to show
that short-term cox-1 inhibition, associated with decreased intestinal pge2 levels, caused small bowel ulcers
in cox-2⫺/⫺ animals, as did short-term dual selective
inhibition of both enzymes in the wild-type animals. the
macroscopic and microscopic appearances of these ulcers
were similar to the indomethacin-induced ones. this
provides strong support for the idea that both enzymes
are involved in the pathogenesis of the small bowel
damage induced by nsaids in mice.
during these studies, we also found that cox-1⫹/⫹
and cox-2⫹/⫹ animals differed in their susceptibility to
the ulcerative damage of indomethacin, which is in keeping with known interspecies and intraspecies variations.29 however, whereas the cox-1⫺/⫺ animals were,
if anything, less susceptible to the small bowel damage of

gastroenterology vol. 122, no. 7

indomethacin, the cox-2⫺/⫺ animals were significantly
more susceptible to this damage than their cox-2⫹/⫹
counterparts. moreover, we demonstrated that long-term
absence or inhibition of cox-2, which does not lead to
significant decreases in intestinal pge2 levels, is associated with small intestine damage. this damage is distinctively different from the acute damage seen in the
short-term experiments in terms of location and histopathologic appearance and occurred without concomitant gastric damage. collectively, this suggests that
cox-2 is important for maintenance of small bowel
integrity. this might be an extraintestinal effect, but
there is increasing (albeit controversial45) evidence that
cox-2 is constitutively expressed in the gastrointestinal
tract.46,47 if so, then the cox-2 products may regulate
neutrophil adherence in the microvasculature in a similar
way as described in the stomach.27 however, the cox-2
products may be important  xxxd371xxx  in the
intestinal mucosal reaction to luminal antigens.48 in this
context, it may be relevant that the terminal ileal location of the ulcers is in the transition area from a low to
a high concentration of luminal bacteria. loss of cox-2
products might impair oral tolerance at this site thereby
rendering the luminal bacteria pathogenic and hence
leading to ulcers. alternatively, and not mutually exclusively, ileal ulcers may occur spontaneously throughout
the life of these animals, and cox-2 inhibition or absence may delay healing of these lesions, similar to the
effects demonstrated in experimental gastric ulceration.49
extrapolation of the aforementioned data to humans is
problematic because there is significant intraspecies and
interspecies variation in the intestinal expression of
cox-1 and cox-2.45 a detailed localization study of
the enzymes in mice has not been performed, but
whereas no cox-2 protein was found in the human
intestine, some rats appeared to express cox-2 in the
cecum.45 however, there are many similarities in the
short-term gastric9,42 and small bowel43,50,51 tolerability
to cox-2–selective agents in humans and animals.
long-term selective cox-2 inhibition is also associated
with good gastric tolerability in humans,10,11 but the
possible small bowel consequences have been assessed
only in short-term studies.50,51 from our studies, it
seems possible that long-term administration of cox-2
inhibitors may lead to ileal inflammation. if so, then the
clinical and theoretical implications of such inflammation are of considerable importance. the serious outcome
studies with rofecoxib12 and celecoxib13 show that small
intestine perforations are at least exceedingly rare with
cox-2–selective agents, as is the case with conventional
nsaids.52 however, nsaid enteropathy is not rare,

june 2002

affecting 10%– 60% of patients taking conventional
nsaids long-term, depending on the diagnostic
method used,4,53–56 and is associated with low-grade
bleeding and protein loss.4,57 the precise location of the
small bowel inflammation associated with nsaid ingestion is unknown, but enteroscopy shows macroscopic
changes in the mid-small bowel consistent with acute
damage. the possibility that long-term nsaid use is
associated with ileal damage has not been assessed directly. nevertheless, ileocolonoscopy with biopsy shows
that 20%–70% of patients with spondylarthropathy,58
most of whom were receiving conventional nsaids,
have ileal inflammation, which has many histopathologic
similarities to crohn’s disease.59,60 however, 1 study
showed an equally high prevalence of ileitis in patients
without spondylitis taking nsaids,61 which, in conjunction with the present results, raises the possibility
that this pathology is iatrogenically induced.
in summary, these studies have shown that short- and
long-term cox-1 deficiency or inhibition and shortterm cox-2 inhibition are not detrimental to small
bowel integrity in mice. dual inhibition of the cox
enzymes, in the absence of the topical effect, leads to the
characteristic small bowel damage seen with indomethacin, in the absence of the topical effect. long-term
cox-2 deficiency or inhibition is frequently associated
with a disrupted small intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, and ileal ulcers, despite normal intestinal pge2 levels. cox-2 products, therefore, seem to
play an important role in the maintenance of small bowel
integrity in mice.
