member of the family of  xxxd2289xxx  binding proteins,
closely related to the adhesion receptor cd44

region implicated in  xxxd2289xxx  binding, present in
 xxxg1018xxx , proteoglycan core proteins, and
the adhesion receptor cd44 . the most extensive sequence homology exists between the predicted  xxxg2297xxx 
protein and cd44. western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against a  xxxg2297xxx  fusion protein detected
a 39-kd glycoprotein in the supernatants of tnftreated fs-4 cells and of cells transfected with  xxxg2297xxx 
cdna. binding of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein to  xxxd2289xxx 
was demonstrated by coprecipitation . our data indicate that the inflammatory cytokine (tnf or il-1)inducible, secretory  xxxg2297xxx  protein is a novel member
of the family of  xxxd2289xxx  binding proteins, possibly
involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis .

recently identified family of  xxxd2289xxx  (ha)' binding proteins includes the cell surface adhesion receptor cd44,  xxxg1018xxx , and proteogly
can core proteins (neame et al ., 1987; goldstein et al .,
1989; stamenkovic et al., 1989). the conserved, homologous regions include the ha binding domains in all ofthese
proteins (goetinck et al., 1987; perin et al ., 1987). cd44,
also termed  xxxg391xxx  (jalkanen et al ., 1986),  xxxg391xxx 
(hughes et al ., 1981), or h-cam (culty et al., 1990), is best
known as an integral membrane protein responsible for the
interaction between lymphocytes and high endothelial cells
in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues during lymph node
homing (jalkanen et al ., 1986) . cd44 is now known to be
identical to the cellular  xxxg391xxx  (aruffo et al.,
1990; culty et al., 1990; miyake et al., 1990), mediating the
adhesion of a variety ofdifferent cells to ha in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces (underhill, 1989) . while
cd44 is the principal cell surface receptor for ha, all functions of this adhesion receptor may not depend on its ability

to bind ha. most notably, the function of cd44 as a lymphocyte homing receptor appears to involve the binding of
cd44 to mucosal vascular addressins, and not to ha (jalkanen et al ., 1987; culty et al., 1990) . cd44 also acts as a
receptor for type i and iv collagen (carter and wayner,
1988) . the fact that cd44 (or closely related proteins) is
(are) expressed on a large variety ofmammalian tissues (underhill, 1989), together with other accumulated evidence,
suggest that cd44 mediates many different cell adhesion
events involving cell-substratum or cell-cell interactions
(aruffo et al., 1990; culty et al., 1990 ; miyake et al ., 1990) .
the  xxxg612xxx  ( xxxg33xxx ) and link protein
are important structural components of the extracellular matrix of cartilage .  xxxg33xxx  (doege et al ., 1990b) and the
closely related  xxxg612xxx  of fibroblasts ( xxxg2407xxx ) (zimmermann and ruoslahti, 1989) contain at their
amino terminus ha binding motifs, which were originally
defined in link protein (doege et al ., 1986) . in cartilage,
 xxxg33xxx  forms a ternary complex with both ha and link
proteins, which determines the structural integrity ofthe extracellular matrix of cartilage (hascall and hascall, 1981;
kimata et al ., 1982) .
in this paper we report the identification ofa new member
of the family of ha binding proteins, provisionally termed

materials and methods
cell cultures
the normal human diploid foreskin fibroblasts (fs-4, fs-48, and fs-49 cell
lines), isolated in this laboratory, were maintained in mem supplemented
with 5 % fbs . the normal human diploid fetal lung fibroblast line wi-38,
and the sv-40-transformed wi-38 cell lin& (wi-38 va13) were received
from the american type culture collection (rockville, md) and grown in
eagles' mem supplemented with 10% fbs . the sv-40-transformed human
skin fibroblast lina13m-637 (obtained from the human genetic mutant cell
repository, camden, nj) and the human cutaneous malignant melanoma
cell line sk-mel-19, kindly provided by dr. alan houghton (memorial
sloan-kettering cancer center, new york), were grown in mem supplemented with 10% fbs. the human macrophage-like cell line, u937, was
grown in rpmi-1640 medium containing 20% fbs . the human rhabdomyosarcoma (a673), human lung carcinoma (a549), and human colon
adenocarcinoma cell lines (colo205 and ht29) were maintained in dme
containing 10% fbs. the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec)
were kindly provided by dr. richard levin (new york university medical
center, new york) and maintained in a-mem supplemented with 20%
fbs and  xxxg787xxx  (10 ng/ml ; a gift from dr. d .
moscatelli, department of cell biology, new york university medical
center) . huvec cultures were used at passage 5. mononuclear cells from
human peripheral blood leukocytes (hupbl) from the blood of healthy
donors were isolated by centrifugation on  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque gradients (isolymph ; gallard-schlesinger chemical manufacturing corp ., carle place,
ny) and cultured in rpmi-1640 medium containing 10% fbs .

phe7 transcripts were prepared with the aid of a nick translation kit (boehringer mannheim corp ., indianapolis, in) .

sequence analysis
among the six x clones that cross-hybridized with tsg-6cdna (lee et al .,
1990), clone x5 had the longest insert (1 .4 kb) and was therefore used for
full-length cdna sequence analysis . the 1.4-kb cdna insert of clone x5
was subcloned into the ecori site of m13mp18 bacteriophage in both orientations . to insure fidelity of sequence determination, directional deletion
clones were generated by the exoiwsi method (henikoff, 1984) in both
directions within the m13 clones . the deletion clones were then used to determine the nucleotide sequence, utilizing the sequenase kit available from
united states biochemical corp . (cleveland, oh) .

preparation ofbacterial fusion proteins
to express a bacterial fusion protein of  xxxg2297xxx , we used an ecori cdna
insert from clone x6 (lee et al ., 1990) . clone x6 contains a cdna insert
that lacks 402 by at the yend and 4 by at the 3' end of the tsg cdna sequence shown in fig . 1 a. an ecorl-bamhi (406 bp) restriction fragment
(which encodes the portion of  xxxg2297xxx  open reading frame spanning from
ile11s to  xxxg241xxx  °a) was isolated from the ecori cdna insert of clone x6 and
cloned into the same restriction sites in the polylinker downstream of, and
in frame with, a portion (37 kd) of the fscherichia coli trpe open reading
frame in the path21 vector (sprindler et al ., 1984), resulting in the
trpe/ xxxg2297xxx  expression plasmid path- xxxg2297xxx . the same restriction fragment (ecori-bamhi) was also inserted into the pex34a bacterial expression vector, resulting in the ms2/ xxxg2297xxx  expression plasmid pex- xxxg2297xxx .
pex34a is a derivative of pex29 (klinkert et al ., 1985 ; strebel et al .,
1986), which permits the production of foreign proteins fused to the nh2terminal part of the ms2 polymerase and controlled by the temperatureinducible xpl promoter. the two expression plasmids (path- xxxg2297xxx  and
pex- xxxg2297xxx ) were transfected into competent e. coli hb101 and e. coli
ahatrp cells (remaut et al ., 1981), respectively. cells transformed with
path- xxxg2297xxx  were grown and induced by the addition of 3-ß-indolacrylic
acid (sigma 11625) (sprindler et al ., 1984), and e. coli transformed with
pex- xxxg2297xxx  were induced by raising the incubation temperature (remaut et
al ., 1981) . purification of both fusion proteins was done essentially as described by strebel et al . (1986) . briefly, cells from a 1l culture were pelleted
and washed with ten (10 mm tris-hci, ph 8.0, 1 mm edta, and 0.5 m
naci), lysed with lysozyme (5 mg/ml), and finally broken by sonication .
insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation (30 min, 20,000 g) and
extracted sequentially with 20 ml of 3 m urea and 5 ml of 7 m urea each
for 30 min at 37°c . the 7 m urea extract containing the fusion protein was
further purified by preparative 10% sds-page . after electrophoresis the
fusion protein was excised from the gel, electroeluted, and concentrated as
needed . the purity of the electroeluted fusion protein was checked on analytical gels. after the second round of electroelution, we obtained highly
purified fusion proteins with no detectable e. coli protein bands on sdspage (data not shown) .

preparation and purification ofpblyclonal antisera
specificfor  xxxg2297xxx  protein

nonadherent u937 cells were treated with tnf (20 ng/tnl) for 4 h at a cell
density of 106 cells/ml . hupbl (1 x 106 mononuclear cells/nil) were
treated with tnf (20 ng/ml), con a (5 uglml), or phytohemagglutinin (2
1xglml) for 16 h . all other adherent cell lines were used when confluent,
and were treated with tnf for 4 h . cell pellets were prepared, and in most
cases total rna was isolated by the acid guanidium-thiocyanate-phenolchloroform extraction method (chomczynski and sacchi, 1987), except
for the normal fibroblast cell lines (fs-4, fs-48, fs-48, and wi-38), for
which a method described elsewhere was used (lin and vil6ek, 1987) .
northern blots were prepared and probed according to maniatis et al .
(1982) . 32 p-labeled probes that detect  xxxg2297xxx  mrna and the invariant

rabbits were first immunized with -200 wg of the trpe/ xxxg2297xxx  fusion protein suspended in freund's complete adjuvant, and boosted at intervals of
2-3 wk with the same amount of protein in freund's incomplete adjuvant .
all injections were performed subcutaneously, except for the final boost
which was done intravenously. rabbits were bled 6 d after immunizations.
sera were analyzed by inununoblotting as described (towbin et al ., 1979) .
to obtain antibodies specific for the  xxxg2297xxx -coded domains in the
trpe/ xxxg2297xxx  fusion protein, the antiserum was purified on an affinity
column to which the ms2/ xxxg2297xxx  fusion protein was coupled . the affinity
column was prepared as follows . 5 mg of purified ms2/ xxxg2297xxx  fusion protein was dialyzed extensively against 0 .5 m naci and mixed with 3 ml of
eah-sepharose 4b beads (pharmacia fine chemicals, piscataway, nj) .
after adjusting ph to 4 .5, 40 mg 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (edc) (aldrich chemical co ., milwaukee, wi)/ml
h2o was added dropwise under constant stirring . the coupling reaction
was then allowed to proceed overnight under constant stirring . 200 pl acetic
acid was then added and the beads were incubated for another 4 h to block
the remaining amino groups on the matrix . the matrix material was washed
several times alternately with a buffer containing 0.1 m acetate, ph 4 .0,

tsg (for tnf-stimulated gene)-6.  xxxg2297xxx  dna has been
isolated from a cdna library prepared from tumor necrosis
factor-ci ( xxxg2296xxx )-treated human fs-4 diploid foreskin fibroblasts (lee et al ., 1990) .  xxxg2297xxx  mrna was undetectable
in untreated fs-4 cells, but became markedly elevated after treatment with tnf.  xxxg2297xxx  mrna was also inducible
by interleukin 1 (il-1), the  xxxd2925xxx   xxxd2925xxx , calcium ionophore a23187, and
double-stranded rna, but not by various growth factors, interferons, and some other agents (lee et al., 1990). the relatively selective inducibility of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna by the inflammatory cytokines tnf and il-1 prompted us to sequence the
full-length cdna and analyze  xxxg2297xxx  mrna expression in
different types of cells . we report here that the protein encoded by  xxxg2297xxx  cdna showed a significant sequence homology with members of the family of ha binding proteins,
and especially with cd44. our data indicate that  xxxg2297xxx  is
a tnf (and il-1)-inducible, secretory ha binding protein.
 xxxg2297xxx  mrna is readily inducible in normal fibroblasts and
peripheral blood leukocytes, but not in a variety of tumorderived or virus-transformed cell lines . its high degree of sequence homology with the n11 2-terminal half of cd44, together with its inducibility by tnf and il-1, suggest that
 xxxg2297xxx  functions as a regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis .

0.5 m naci and a buffer containing 0.1 m nahc03 , ph 8.3, 0.5 m nacl,
and finally suspended and stored in tbs (20 mm tris-hci, ph 7.5, 0.5 m

was mixed and incubated with 1 nil of antiserum at 4°c overnight under
constant rotation . the reaction mixture was then washed three times with
3 ml ttbs. to elute bound antibody specific for the  xxxg2297xxx  protein, 1 ml
of 0.1 m glycine-hci buffer, ph 2 .5, was added to the beads, and the supernatant was collected and immediately neutralized with solid tris .

stable tlransfection of  xxxg2297xxx  cdna into
gm-637 cells
an expression plasmid psvtsg-6 was constructed by replacing the 0-tubulin isotype, mß1 coding region in the plasmid psvßl (lewis et al ., 1987)
with the full-length  xxxg2297xxx  cdna . to exploit suitable restriction enzyme
sites for easier cloning we used the m13mp18 vector carrying the full-length
 xxxg2297xxx  cdna at the ecori site, in either the sense or antisense orientation
with respect to lac promoter (pi.) . a hindiii-ncol fragment containing
the 5' region of  xxxg2297xxx  cdna was isolated from the antisense construct and
a ncol-kpnl fragment containing the 3' region of  xxxg2297xxx  cdna was isolated
from the sense construct. both fragments were ligated into the hindih/kpni
cleaved plasmid psvßl . the resulting expression construct (psvtsg-6)
was used to cotransfect the gm-637 cell line with prsvneo (gorman et al .,
1983), a plasmid that contains the bacterial neomycin resistance gene linked
to rsv ltr, by capo4-dna precipitation (graham and van der eb,
1973) . the transfected cells were given a 30-s glycerol shock by treatment with 15 % glycerol, and further incubated for 16 h . thereafter, the cell
monolayers were replated in medium containing  xxxg418xxx  (800 jig/ml) to select
for cells expressing the neomycin resistance marker. colonies were isolated
from transfection plates with the aid of cloning rings, subcloned in 24-well
plates, and expanded to monolayer cultures. multiple independent transfec-

tants were selected and tested for the expression of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna by northern blot analysis. the gsvl5 line, found to express the highest level of
 xxxg2297xxx  mrna, was used in the experiments.

partial enrichment of  xxxg2297xxx  protein by affinity
chromatography on sepharose-bound ha

sepharose-bound ha was prepared essentially as described by tengblad
(1979), except that the water-soluble coupling agent edc was used in judicious quantities to prevent excess modification of the carboxylic groups in
ha . we used 10 lumol edc/100 mg ha per ml of eah-sepharose, so that
-1 out of 25 carboxylic groups in ha would be coupled to the amino groups
on the beads. for the enrichment of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein, 300 nil of the conditioned medium from gsvl5 cultures containing 10% serum was adjusted
to ph 5 .0 by adding 3 m sodium acetate (ph 4 .6) and then applied onto
an ha-sepharose column (2 ml bed volume) which had been equilibrated
with pbs containing 100 mm sodium acetate, ph 5.0 (apbs) .
nonspecifically bound material was eluted with 15 ml apbs. specifically
bound proteins were eluted with apbs containing 2 m naci plus 4 m
guanidine-hci, dialyzed against pbs, and then stored frozen until used .

coprecipitation of  xxxg2297xxx  protein with
glycosaminoglycans by cetylpyridinium chloride
to analyze the binding of  xxxg2297xxx  protein to ha and other glycosaminoglycans,  xxxg2297xxx  protein-glycosaminoglycan complexes were precipitated by
cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) . 25-al aliquots of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein partially enriched on hasepharose were mixed with 40 lug (in a final volume
of 120,ul in pbs) of. ha (h4015 ; sigma chemical co.), chondmitin 4,6sulfate (c8529 ; sigma chemical co.), dermatan sulfate (c4259; sigma

 xxxg2297xxx  cdna codesfor a putative protein with
homology to lymphocyte homing receptor cd44
and the cartilage linkprotein family

 xxxg2297xxx  cdna was originally isolated from a cdna library
prepared from tnf-treated cultures of normal human
diploid fs-4 foreskin fibroblasts (lee et al., 1990) . to determine what other cell types express  xxxg2297xxx  message, we examined a large number of cell lines for the presence of  xxxg2297xxx 
mrna by northern blot analysis (fig. 1) . in each of the cell
lines rna from both untreated and tnf-treated cultures
was examined .  xxxg2297xxx  mrna was not detectable in any of
the cell lines without tnf treatment .  xxxg2297xxx  mrna became
readily detectable after tnf treatment in fs-4 cells (fig . 1,
a-c) and in the wi-38 line of normal human fetal lung
fibroblasts (fig. 1 d) . tnf treatment produced a similar increase in steady-state  xxxg2297xxx  mrna levels in two other normal human foreskin fibroblast lines, designated fs-48 and
fs-49 (data not shown) . however, in none of the tumorderived cell lines (u937, a673, a549, colo205, ht29, and
sk-mel19) or sv-40-transformed fibroblast lines (gm-637
and wi-38va13) was  xxxg2297xxx  mrna detectable after tnf
treatment (fig . 1, a-c) . we also examined the inducibility
of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna in cloned lines derived from the fs-4 cell
line after transfection with sv-40 large t antigen . interestingly, these cell lines, which display altered growth charac-

full-length  xxxg2297xxx  cdna was found to be 1,414 bases long,
apparently consisting of a 68-base 5'-untranslated region, a
continuous open reading frame of 831 bases, and a 3' atrich
untranslated region (-75 % a+t content) (fig . 3 a) . within
the 3'-untranslated region are multiple mrna destabilization consensus sequence motifs auuua (shaw and kamen,
1986), which may account for the decline in the  xxxg2297xxx 
mrna level seen after 4 h or more of continuous treatment
with tnf (lee et al ., 1990) . a consensus polyadenylation
signal (aataaa) is also located at the 3' end . the largest
open reading frame predicts a polypeptide of 277 amino
acids with an estimated molecular weight of 31,200. no
other open reading frame with a significant length was
found . the putative initiation methionine is followed by 11
consecutive hydrophobic amino acids, followed by a charged
region, suggesting that this portion might form a cleavable
signal peptide (fig . 3 b) . following the (-3,-1) rule (von
heijne, 1984), the putative signal sequence cleavage site will
be located after gly' 9. this would result in a mature form
of the protein with a predicted molecular weight of 28,895
and a calculated pl of 7.0. in addition, the predicted  xxxg2297xxx 
protein sequence contains two potential sites of n-linked
glycosylation (asn' 18arg-ser and asnua-thr-ser) . the sequence ser°'-gly preceded by an acidic amino acid (glu")
is indicative of a potential chrondroitin sulfate linkage site
(zimmermann and ruoslahti, 1989) . it is also worth noting
that there is an  xxxd233xxx -rich region (residue asp"9 to
 xxxg241xxx  1, ) in addition to a serine- and threonine-rich region at
the cooh-terminal end ; the latter region includes six consecutive ser/thr residues (thr2 " to thr26°), which may

added to the samples and the mixtures were stirred and then incubated for
another 1 h at 37°c. after incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged for
15 min in a centrifuge (eppendorf inc., fremont, ca) at maximum speed .
the pellets were carefully rinsed twice with 1% cpc containing 20 mm
nacl . the pellets were then dissolved in 100 pl sds-page sample buffer
(60 mm tris-hci, ph 6.8,2% sds, 10% glycerol, 7 % 0-mencaptoethanol,
0.001% bromphenol blue) . the supernatants were also collected and
processed for electrophoresis. after fractionation on sds-page (12%
polyacrylamide),  xxxg2297xxx  protein present in the pellets and supernatants was
visualized by western analysis with the aid of affinity-purified anti- xxxg2297xxx 
antibody.

teristics but do not appear to be fully transformed, showed
much lower levels of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna after tnf treatment
than the parental fs-4 cells (fig. 1 c). the lack of  xxxg2297xxx 
mrna induction seen in the fully transformed cells and the
decreased inducibility in the sv-40 t antigen-transfected
fs-4 lines were not the result of a general lack of responsiveness of these cells to tnr for example, tsg44 mrna
(lee et al ., 1990) was more strongly inducible by tnf in
the sv-40 t antigen-transfected fs-4 lines than in the original fs-4 cells (data not shown) . hence, it appears that induction of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna is suppressed in transformed cells .
we also examined the inducibility of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna by
tnf in normal huvec. the latter cells are known to be
highly responsive to tnf and several genes inducible by
tnf in normal fibroblasts were also inducible in huvec
cultures (collins et al ., 1986 ; holzman et al ., 1990) . we
were therefore surprised to find that tnf treatment failed to
induce the appearance of  xxxg2297xxx  mrna in these cells (fig .
2 a) . however, we were able to demonstrate an increase in
 xxxg2297xxx  mrna levels in cultures of freshly isolated peripheral blood human mononuclear cells after treatment with
tnf or after treatment with the t cell mitogens con a or
phytohemagglutinin (fig . 2 b) . although the cell type
producing  xxxg2297xxx  mrna in the heterogeneous cultures of
mononuclear cells has not been identified, the latter results
show that induction of  xxxg2297xxx  mrnas is not restricted to
fibroblasts .

 xxxg2297xxx  is a secretory protein
as a first step toward the characterization of the protein
coded for by the  xxxg2297xxx  cdna, we immunized rabbits with
an e. coli-derived fusion protein composed of portions of
the e. coli trpe and  xxxg2297xxx  proteins. the resulting antibody
was purified by adsorption and elution on a sepharose
column to which a ms2/ xxxg2297xxx  fusion protein was coupled
(see materials and methods). we also constructed a constitutive expression plasmid psvtsg-6 containing the complete  xxxg2297xxx  coding region (see materials and methods).
this expression construct was used to transfect the gm-637
cell line, together with the prsvneo plasmid containing the
bacterial neomycin resistance gene. the gm-637 line was
earlier shown not to express detectable endogenous  xxxg2297xxx 
mrna (see fig. 1 a). after clonal isolation, the gsvls
line that constitutively expressed a high level of  xxxg2297xxx 
mrna was chosen for the analysis of the presence oftsg-6
protein .
fig . 6 a (top) shows that no immunoreactive band was detected by western blot analysis of a concentrated culture supernatant ofgm-637 cells transfected with plasmid prsvneo
alone (marked "gn4r) . in convast, two immunoreactive
bands were present in the supernatant of the gsvls line,
transfected with the  xxxg2297xxx  cdna-containing expression
vector. the faster migrating band, with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kd on sds-page, may represent the glycosylated form of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein. (the molecular mass of
the mature  xxxg2297xxx  protein based on the primary sequence is
n29 kd.) in addition, a slower migrating immunoreactive
band (>110 kd) was detected .

tended loop involving two disulfide bonds, conserved in all
of these proteins. this loop structure was shown to form the
ha binding domain of link protein (goetinck et al., 1987),
and is also thought to be responsible for ha recognition in
the other proteins in this family (perm et al. , 1987; culty et
al . , 1990) .

serve as acceptors for o-linked carbohydrates (tomita et al . ,
1978).
comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the
 xxxg2297xxx  cdna with the protein sequences available in databases revealed interesting homologies (fig. 4) . the nhzterminal half of the putative  xxxg2297xxx  gene product shows a
high degree of homology with the human lymphocyte homing receptor/ha receptor cd44 (goldstein et al ., 1989;
stamenkovic et al ., 1989), human  xxxg1018xxx 
(dudhia and hardingham, 1989; doege et al., 1990x), and
the human proteoglycan core proteins  xxxg2407xxx  (zimmermann and ruoslahti, 1989) and  xxxg33xxx  (doege et al .,
1990b), with the positions of four cysteine residues conserved in all of these proteins (fig. 4 a) . based on the alignment shown in fig. 4 a, this portion of the predicted  xxxg2297xxx 
protein (residues 36-127) shows ti37 % identity with cd44,
36% identity with  xxxg1018xxx , and 40% identity
with the proteoglycan core proteins  xxxg2407xxx  and  xxxg33xxx  .
the highest degree of homology (~60%) exists between a
limited region (cysb' to proms) of the  xxxg2297xxx  cdna-encoded
protein and a corresponding region of link protein and proteoglycan core proteins. the conserved basic amino acids in
this region have been implicated in an ionic-type interaction
with the negatively charged uronic acid residues in ha
(hardingham et al . , 1976; lyon, 1986; goetinck et al . ,
1987) . no significant sequence homology was found between the  xxxg2297xxx  protein and most other members of this
family upstream of g1y 36 or downstream of cys'z' in  xxxg2297xxx .
however, sequence homology between the  xxxg2297xxx  and cd44
proteins extends over wider portions of the two molecules .
an alignment of residues 33-142 of  xxxg2297xxx  with a homologous portion of cd44 reveals 37 % identity (fig . 4 b). in addition, the cooh-terminal half of  xxxg2297xxx  (fig. 4 c) shows
n30% sequence homology with the a-fragment of complement clr a chain (leytus et al ., 1986).
the predicted secondary sequence of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein
(fig. 5) reveals that the region homologous to cd44, link
protein, and the proteoglycan core proteins forms an ex-

to determine whether the  xxxg2297xxx  protein was also detectable in the fs-4 fibroblast line, cultures were either stimulated with 20 ng/ml tnf or left untreated . after 24 h the
medium was collected and concentrated -100-fold in an
amicon apparatus (amicon, beverly, ma) . samples were
subjected to western blot analysis, side-by-side with the
samples of cultures transfected with the  xxxg2297xxx  expression
vector (fig. 6 a, top) . a major 39-kd band and a minor
>110-kd band were detected by the affinity-purified antiserum in the culture supernatant of tnf-treated fs-4 cells
(lane marked fs-4 (t)), but not in control fs-4 cultures
(marked fs-4 (c)) . the two bands seen in the supernatant
of tnf-stimulated fs-4 cells were identical to the bands detected in the medium of gsvl5 cultures . as also seen with
gsvl5 cells (cf. fig. 6, a and b), the proportion of the 39kd and >110-kd bands detected in the media from tnftreated fs-4 cells varied from one experiment to another
(not shown) . no bands were detected in either gsvl5 cultures or tnf-stimulated fs-4 cells when identically processed preimmune serum from the same rabbit was used in
western blot analysis (fig . 6 a, bottom) . taken together,
these results indicate that both the 39-kd and the >110-kd
bands detected by the immune serum represent products of

the  xxxg2297xxx  gene . subsequent analysis indicated that the apparent molecular mass of the >110-kd band is -120 kd (see
fig . 7), suggesting that it may represent either an undissociated trimeric form of  xxxg2297xxx  or a complex of  xxxg2297xxx  with
another protein . since sds-page separations were run under reducing conditions (7% ß- xxxd26xxx ), it is unlikely that intermolecular disulfide linkage accounted for the
formation of the 120-kd form.
while a 39-kd immunoreactive band was readily detectable in the concentrated culture medium of gsv l5 cells, a
cell extract from the same cultures failed to reveal the presence of  xxxg2297xxx  protein (fig. 6 b) . similarly, we were unable
to detect the  xxxg2297xxx  protein in extracts of tnf-treated fs-4
cultures (not shown) . these data suggest that, once synthesized,  xxxg2297xxx  protein is rapidly secreted into the culture
medium . these findings are in agreement with the presence
of a cleavable signal peptide, predicted from the deduced
amino acid sequence (fig . 3, a and b) .
 xxxg2297xxx  is a glycoprotein
inasmuch as the deduced amino acid sequence of the  xxxg2297xxx 
protein predicts two potential n-glycosylation sites, the presence of n-linked carbohydrate was analyzed by n-glycosi-

predicted disulfide bond formation between cys' 35

supernatants was first partially purified by affinity chromatography (see materials and methods) and then treated with
16.7 u/ml n-glycosidase f at 37°c for different times. a 3-h
incubation with the enzyme resulted in the disappearance of
the 39-kd band and the appearance of two bands with apparent molecular masses of 36 and 33 kd, respectively (fig. 7) .

form was apparently converted into the 33-kd band (not
shown) . these data suggest that the 36-kd band corresponds
to a partially deglycosylated form, and the 33-kd band to
a monomeric form of  xxxg2297xxx  protein completely devoid of
n-linked carbohydrate . these results are consistent with
the predicted presence of two n-glycosylation consensus sequences in the  xxxg2297xxx  protein (figs. 3 a and 5) . glycosidase
treatment also resulted in a decrease of the higher molecular
weight band recognized by antibodies to the  xxxg2297xxx  protein,
from an apparent molecular mass of -120 kd to -110 kd
(fig . 7) .
in view of the presence of a potential  xxxd1687xxx 
linkage site, as noted above (figs. 3 a and 5), we also examined the effect of  xxxd1687xxx  abc lyase (chondroitinase abc) on the apparent molecular size of  xxxg2297xxx 
protein produced in gsvl5 cultures. the latter treatment
resulted in no demonstrable change in the migration pattern
of the 120- or the 39-kd band recognized by the antibody
to  xxxg2297xxx  (data not shown), suggesting the absence of a
linked  xxxd1687xxx  moiety.

protein family (figs . 4 a and 5), it seemed plausible that the
 xxxg2297xxx  protein too is an ha binding protein . to test this notion we first determined whether  xxxg2297xxx  protein would bind
to ha immobilized on sepharose beads. it has been known
that ha binding proteins, such as  xxxg612xxx 
and  xxxg1018xxx , can be purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized ha (tengblad, 1979) . since ha
is a linear polysaccharide built from repeating disaccharide
units consisting of d-glucuronic acid and  xxxd2683xxx , every carboxylic group of d-glucuronic acid unit in
ha can be potentially modified by the coupling agent edc
and immobilized to the amino group of eah-sepharose. to
prevent complete modification of the carboxylic groups in
ha we used a subeffective concentration of edc (10 pmol/
100 mg of ha), so that til out of every 25 carboxylic groups
would be modified and coupled to the functional amino
groups of eah-sepharose . using this approach, we were
able to effectively enrich the  xxxg2297xxx  protein from the conditioned medium of gsvl5 cultures by column affinity chromatography on eah-sepharose coupled with ha (hasepharose) . in addition, we were able to partially block the
binding of  xxxg2297xxx  protein to ha-sepharose by adding soluble ha, but not by soluble  xxxd1687xxx , when the two
glycosaminoglycans were used at the same concentration of
1 mg/ml (data not shown) .
to address more directly the specific interaction between
 xxxg2297xxx  protein and ha we attempted to coprecipitate  xxxg2297xxx 
protein with ha and other glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin
4,5-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin) .
it has been shown that glycosaminoglycans can be precipitated by cationic detergents such as cpc as a result of bulky
salt formation between the two molecules (scott, 1961) . we
reasoned that if the  xxxg2297xxx  protein interacts with ha through
specific recognition of sugar residues as well as through an

1989) . although many different cell types can be induced to
produce  xxxg2296xxx , il-la, and il-lß, in the intact organism
their main sources appear to be monocytes and macrophages
(le and vi1zek, 1987 ; dinarello, 1988 ; vil6ek and lee,
1991) . all three cytokines are characteristically produced at
sites of inflammation ; they play beneficial roles as immunoregulators, mediators of host resistance, and promoters of tissue repair. on the other hand, overproduction of
tnf or il-1 during inflammation can lead to tissue damage
and systemic toxicity (balkwill, 1989) . earlier we reported
the isolation of eight distinct cdnas from a cdna library
prepared from  xxxg2296xxx -treated normal human fs-4 foreskin
fibroblasts (lee et al ., 1990) . all eight cdnas correspond
to mrnas whose levels are either undetectable or very low
in untreated fs-4 cells, and are significantly increased upon
the exposure of cells to either tnf or il-1 . partial sequencing of these cdnas revealed that four of them represent
known genes, namely, il-8 (a cytokine whose major role
is thought to be chemotactic activity for neutrophils and
t cells),  xxxg357xxx  (a
cytokine structurally related to il-8), and the metalloproteinases collagenase and stromelysin, respectively (lee et
al ., 1990) . subsequently, a fifth cdna (tsg-37) was found
to be identical to metallothionein ii (lee, t. h ., and g . w.
lee, unpublished data) . the three remaining cdnas could

figure 8. effect of varying concentrations of  xxxd2289xxx  on the
coprecipitation of  xxxg2297xxx  protein by cpc. a constant amount of
 xxxg2297xxx  protein partially enriched by affinity chromatography on
ha coupled to sepharose was mixed with varying concentrations
of ha for 1 h and processed as described in materials and methods .
constant glycosaminoglycan concentration (330 lg/ml) was maintained by adding varying amounts of  xxxd1687xxx  as a carrier.
western analysis was performed to visualize  xxxg2297xxx  protein bound
to ha in the precipitate (ppt) as well as unbound  xxxg2297xxx  protein
in the supernatant (sup) . the 120- and 39-kd bands of the  xxxg2297xxx 
protein are marked with arrows .

ionic interaction, then the  xxxg2297xxx  protein could be coprecipitated more efficiently with ha than with other glycosaminoglycans . this prediction was essentially borne out .  xxxg2297xxx 
protein from a culture supernatant of gsv l5 cultures was
enriched by affinity chromatography on ha-sepharose, as
described in materials and methods. a constant amount of
the enriched  xxxg2297xxx  protein was incubated with varying concentrations of ha and/or  xxxd1687xxx  (fig. 8) . cpc
was then added to all samples and the resulting precipitates
were sedimented by centrifugation . the pellets as well as the
supernatants were then analyzed for the presence of  xxxg2297xxx 
protein by western blotting. ha produced a concentration-dependent coprecipitation of the 120- and 39-kd bands
of  xxxg2297xxx  . addition of  xxxd1687xxx  caused no coprecipitation, nor did the presence of  xxxd1687xxx  affect
coprecipitation with ha . since  xxxd1687xxx  carries a
stronger negative charge than ha, this result suggests that
the binding of  xxxg2297xxx  to ha is not due solely to a simple
ionic interaction .
similar coprecipitation experiments were also carried out
with  xxxg2297xxx  and dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin (not shown) . when used at concentrations up to 2.5 mg/
ml, dermatan sulfate (like  xxxd1687xxx ) produced no
detectable coprecipitation of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein (not shown) .
heparan sulfate and heparin, though clearly less effective
than ha when used at the same concentrations, at higher
concentrations produced a partial coprecipitation of the 120kd band with little or no coprecipitation of the 39-kd band
of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein . taken together, these results suggest
that interaction of  xxxg2297xxx  protein with ha involves a recognition of sugar residues specific to ha, perhaps together
with an ionic-type interaction .

varied from experiment to experiment . the 120-kd form
may represent an undissociated complex of  xxxg2297xxx  with a
putative carrier molecule or a tightly held  xxxg2297xxx  homotrimer.
since the predicted sequence of the protein indicated that
 xxxg2297xxx  is a member of the family of ha binding proteins,
we sought to determine whether the  xxxg2297xxx  protein too can
bind ha .  xxxg2297xxx  protein secreted into the medium of gm637 cells transfected with a  xxxg2297xxx  expression vector was
partially purified by adsorption and elution on sepharosebound ha. that binding to ha involves more than a simple
ionic interaction is supported by the experiments in which
we demonstrated coprecipitation of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein with
ha by the cationic detergent cpc (fig. 8). these experiments indicate that cpc, which interacts with the polyanionic glycosaminoglycans through an ionic-type interaction,
did not cause dissociation of the complexes formed between
 xxxg2297xxx  and ha. the failure of cpc to coprecipitate  xxxg2297xxx 
mixed with chondroitin-4,5-sulfate or dermatan sulfate suggests a weaker and less specific interaction between  xxxg2297xxx 
and these glycosaminoglycans. it is interesting that  xxxg2297xxx 
protein was not coprecipitated with chondroitin-4,5-sulfate
and dermatan sulfate (fig. 8 and data not shown), even
though they share with ha the common structural feature of
alternating ßl-3 and ßl-4 bonds and have an even higher
charge density because oftheir sulfation . on the other hand,
heparan sulfate, which differs from ha considerably by having alternating al-4 and ßl-4 bonds but shares with ha
the content of n- xxxd2683xxx , seems to interact with
 xxxg2297xxx  protein stronger than some other glycosaminoglycans, though not as strongly as ha (not shown) .
what is the biological function of the  xxxg2297xxx  protein? the
final answer to this question will have to await the results of
experiments with purified  xxxg2297xxx  protein. in view of its homology with cd44 and demonstrated ability to interact with
ha, secretory  xxxg2297xxx  protein could act as a competitive inhibitor of the interaction between cd44 and its ligand(s) .
although cd44 is thought to represent the principal ha
receptor, expressed on a wide variety of cells (stoolman,
1989 ; underhill, 1989), some functions of cd44 may not
depend on its ability to bind ha (carter and wayner, 1988;
culty et al ., 1990) . hence it is conceivable that the biological functions of  xxxg2297xxx  also are not limited to situations in
which binding to ha is involved . even if interaction with
ha would not be central to its biological function, binding
of  xxxg2297xxx  to ha might act as a means to efficiently concentrate  xxxg2297xxx  in the extracellular matrix, in the vicinity of its
target cells . future experiments will seek to determine
whether  xxxg2297xxx  can compete with cd44 for binding to ha,
and also whether  xxxg2297xxx  can affect lymphocyte homing
mediated by the interaction of cd44 with a still incompletely characterized mucosal vascular addressin (jalkanen
et al., 1987; stoolman, 1989) .
inducibility by tnf or il-1 suggests a role for  xxxg2297xxx  in
inflammation . in bcg-induced granulomatous inflammation, tnf released from macrophages plays a crucial role
in the aggregation and activation of macrophages, leading to
the development ofgranulomas (kindler et al., 1989) . in addition, an increase in ha was found in the early stage of the
bcg-induced granulomatous response in the rabbit lung
(love et al., 1979) and in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (shannon and love, 1980; campbell et al., 1982) . the
interaction between ha and cd44 is thought to be involved

not be matched with dna sequences available in databanks,
suggesting that they correspond to novel genes.
in this paper we describe the characterization ofone ofthe
novel cdnas, termed  xxxg2297xxx  . the largest open reading
frame predicted a polypeptide of 277 amino acids, including
a characteristic hydrophobic signal peptide sequence (fig.
3). the putative amino acid sequence deduced from the
 xxxg2297xxx  cdna revealed a significant degree ofhomology with
a conserved region present in a recently identified family of
proteins (fig. 4) that includes the ha receptor/lymphocyte
homing receptor cd44 (goldstein et al., 1989; stamenkovic et al., 1989),  xxxg1018xxx  (dudhia and hardingham, 1989; doege et al ., 1990a), and the proteoglycan
core proteins  xxxg2407xxx  (zimmermann and ruoslahti, 1989)
and  xxxg33xxx  (doege et al ., 1990b). the homologous region, thought to comprise the ha binding domain (goetinck
et al., 1987; perin et al ., 1987; culty et al., 1990), is tandemly repeated in the cartilage linkprotein and proteoglycan
core proteins, while being represented only once in cd44
(goldstein et al ., 1989; stamenkovic et al., 1989) as well as
in  xxxg2297xxx  (figs. 3 and 5) . the degree of sequence homology
between  xxxg2297xxx  and the other human proteins of this family
is of a similar magnitude as the homology of the other members of this family to each other. based on a similar alignment of the sequences ofhuman cd44 with rat and chicken
cartilage link proteins (showing a homology of -30%),
stamenkovic et al . (1989) calculated that the probability of
an equal or better match occurring between unrelated proteins was <10 - 's . interestingly, the homology between  xxxg2297xxx 
and cd44 extended over regions of the two proteins that
showed no significant homology with the other members of
this protein family (fig. 4b) . this finding suggests a closer
evolutionary relationship of  xxxg2297xxx  to cd44 than to the cartilage link and proteoglycan core proteins. the homologous
sequences in the  xxxg2297xxx  and cd44 proteins may have diverged from the same ancestral gene before duplication of
this domain in the proteoglycan core and cartilage link proteins, or they may have been derived from one of these domains (goldstein et al ., 1989).
antibodies generated against a bacterial fusion protein of
 xxxg2297xxx  were used to demonstrate the presence of  xxxg2297xxx  protein in the culture medium of cells transfected with a  xxxg2297xxx 
expression vector or in fs-4 fibroblasts treated with tnf
(fig. 6). the 39-kd band defined by the antibodies apparently represents the fully glycosylated mature monomeric
form of  xxxg2297xxx  protein. the generation of two faster migrating bands (36 and 33 kd, respectively) after treatment with
n-glycosidase f (fig. 7) is consistent with the presence of
two potential n-glycosylation sites in the coding sequence.
the apparent molecular weight of  xxxg2297xxx  protein after
prolonged treatment with n-glycosidase f (33 kd) is somewhat greater than the predicted molecular weight of 28,895
of the unglycosylated mature polypeptide . this small discrepancy could be due to incomplete deglycosylation (e.g .,
presence of o-linked carbohydrate) or to slightly anomalous
migration characteristics on sds-page .
a higher molecular weight form with the apparent size of
-120 kd was also detected by the anti- xxxg2297xxx  antibody in the
culture media of gm-637 cells transfected with  xxxg2297xxx  cdna
and oftnf-treated fs-4 cells (figs. 6a, 7, and 8) . although
all sds-page separations were done under reducing conditions, the proportions between the 120- and 39-kd forms

in macrophage aggregation (green et al., 1988). hence, it
is conceivable that the  xxxg2297xxx  protein, induced by tnf or
il-1 in the microenvironment of inflammatory granulomas,
modulates the aggregation and activation of macrophages
mediated by the ha-cd44 interaction . it is also of interest
that tnf and il-1 increase the amount of ha secreted by
human synovial fibroblasts (butler et al ., 1988) . local accumulation of ha may facilitate cell migration to sites of injury, modulate cell proliferation, and regulate inflammatory
and immune cell responses by effects on antigen and/or mediator binding (laurent and fraser, 1986; whiteside and
buckingham, 1989; meyer et al ., 1990) .  xxxg2297xxx  also could
play a role in the modulation of these processes .
the presence of a shared ha binding domain in  xxxg2297xxx ,
 xxxg1018xxx , and proteoglycan core proteins suggests a possible involvement of  xxxg2297xxx  in the structural organization ofthe extracellular matrix of connective tissue . the
structural integrity of cartilage is maintained by the ternary
complex involving proteoglycan, link protein, and ha (hascall and hascall, 1981) . cartilage breakdown occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other joint diseases as a
result of destabilization of the ternary complex . tnf and
il-1 are known to cause proteoglycan degradation, leading
to cartilage breakdown (saklatvala, 1986; shinmei et al .,
1989). it is conceivable that  xxxg2297xxx  protein induced by tnf
or il-1 during inflammation could interact with link protein
or  xxxg612xxx  through the shared homologous
domain, resulting in a destabilization ofthe proteoglycan aggregates.
since both tnf and il-1 are mitogenic for normal fibroblasts (schmidt et al., 1982; sugarman et al ., 1985 ; vil6ek
et al ., 1986), generation of  xxxg2297xxx  could be related to the
processes of wound healing, tissue repair, and fibrosis . it is
intriguing that none of the transformed cells examined by us
was found to contain demonstrable  xxxg2297xxx  mrna (fig. 1).
the lack of  xxxg2297xxx  expression in tumor cell lines contrasts
with the high level of cd44 mrna expression in many
transformed cells (stamenkovic et al ., 1989) . the involvement ofha and the cellular ha receptor in transformation,
invasive growth, and metastasis has been well established
(knudson et al., 1989) . invasiveness oftumor growth correlates with increased amounts of ha in the tumor and in the
interface to the surrounding connective tissue (toole et al.,
1979) . virus-transformed cells showed an increased ha
binding capacity compared with the parental cell lines (underhill and toole, 1981) . a highly invasive bladder carcinoma also showed a high degree of ha binding (nemec et
al., 1987) . finally, günthert et al. (1991) recently showed a
causal relationship between the expression of a novel splicing variant of cd44 and the metastatic potential of rat tumor
cell lines . inasmuch as  xxxg2297xxx  binds to ha, it is conceivable
that  xxxg2297xxx  is involved in the modulation of these processes,
possibly as a competitive inhibitor of cd44 binding to ha.
in conclusion, we have identified a novel inflammatory
cytokine-inducible gene, termed  xxxg2297xxx , coding for a protein
that includes a unique loop domain homologous to a sequence in the ha receptor/lymphocyte homing receptor
cd44,  xxxg1018xxx , and proteoglycan core proteins . mature  xxxg2297xxx  is a secreted protein whose apparent
molecular mass is 39 kd in monomeric form. it is glycosylated at two n-linked glycan acceptor sites. we have shown
that the  xxxg2297xxx  protein binds ha. together these characteris-

tics suggest that  xxxg2297xxx  plays a role in cell-cell or cell-cell
matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis.
