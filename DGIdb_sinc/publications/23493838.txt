abstract:  xxxd359xxx  ( xxxd359xxx ) is an orally available, once-daily, dual src and abl kinase
inhibitor with promising clinical potential in first-, second-, and third-line treatment of
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml).  xxxd359xxx  effectively inhibits wild-type bcr-abl and
most imatinib-resistant bcr-abl mutations except for v299l and t315i. low hematologic
toxicity is a remarkable characteristic of this novel second-generation  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,
and this has been ascribed to its minimal activity against the platelet-derived growth factor
receptor and kit. low-grade, typically self-limiting diarrhea, which usually appears within
the first few weeks after treatment initiation, represents the predominant toxicity of  xxxd359xxx .
other treatment-associated adverse events are mostly mild to moderate.  xxxd359xxx  has been
approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of chronic, accelerated,
or blast phase philadelphia chromosome-positive cml in adult patients with resistance or
intolerance to prior therapy. this review summarizes the main properties of  xxxd359xxx  and the
currently available data on its clinical potential in the treatment of cml.

chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder. reciprocal
translocation of the chromosomal region carrying the  xxxg23xxx  localized
on chromosome 9 to the  xxxg256xxx  (bcr) on chromosome 22 has
been identified as the crucial step in malignant cell formation.1 the resulting bcrabl fusion gene encodes a constitutively active  xxxg2198xxx  which significantly
influences cellular signal transduction.2 numerous preclinical and clinical studies
have demonstrated that the bcr-abl oncoprotein is the major cause of the disease,
and suggest that most cml cells are oncogene-addicted to the activated kinase.
the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2333xxx  (formerly sti571 or  xxxd2332xxx ),
was the first-in-class drug to inhibit bcr-abl successfully and was approved for
the treatment of cml more than ten years ago.3–5 the treatment-associated adverse
effects of imatinib have been at least partially ascribed to its inhibitory activity against
platelet-derived growth factor receptor, kit, and the abl kinases.6 the strong activity
of imatinib is reflected by high rates of event-free survival and overall survival (81%
and 85%, respectively), after 8 years of follow-up within the international randomized
study of interferon and sti571 [iris] trial.7 however, after 5–8 years, only 55%–75%
of patients were still taking imatinib within the clinical trials. one major reason aside
from toxicity was the emergence of resistance, and this remains a difficult task in the

treatment of cml.7,8 bcr-abl kinase domain mutations
impairing imatinib binding have been identified as the predominant cause of imatinib resistance.9
the second-generation  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors,  xxxd2724xxx 
(formerly amn107),  xxxd1815xxx  (formerly  xxxd1815xxx ),
and  xxxd359xxx  (formerly  xxxd359xxx ), inhibit most resistanceconferring bcr-abl mutations. based on convincing results
from the clinical trials,  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd359xxx 
have been approved for the treatment of patients with cml
who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.10–12
the high efficacy of  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd359xxx 
prompted initiation of phase iii clinical trials to evaluate the clinical potential of these three compounds in the
treatment of newly diagnosed, untreated cml. in all the
trials, the second-generation  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors were
judged to be superior to imatinib with regard to molecular
response rates, time to achievement of remissions, and
frequency of progression to accelerated phase and/or blast
crisis.13–15 however, not all of these effects were statistically
significant. moreover, due to differing clinical trial designs,
in particular regarding the primary study endpoints (major
molecular remission, confirmed cytogenetic remission, or
complete cytogenetic remission), as well as different definitions of freedom from progression, event-free survival, and
progression-free survival, the results of these trials cannot
be directly compared. in this review, currently available
data concerning the target profile of  xxxd359xxx  and clinical
potential of  xxxd359xxx  are summarized.

target profile of  xxxd359xxx 
 xxxd359xxx  potently targets src and abl tyrosine kinases,
while activity against other kinases is distinctly lower.17
structural and spectroscopic analyses have improved our
understanding of its activity of  xxxd359xxx  against imatinibresistant bcr-abl mutants.16

src kinase inhibition
src is a nonreceptor protein  xxxg2198xxx  and a member
of the src family kinases. these kinases interact with various signal transduction pathways downstream of different
surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins, g protein-coupled receptors, and antigen receptors.17
src kinases are presumably involved in malignant cell
transformation, disease progression, and metastatic spread
of solid tumors.18–20 in cml, src family kinases have
been associated with disease progression, and bcr-ablindependent forms of imatinib resistance have been reviewed
elsewhere.20  xxxd359xxx  effectively inhibits src kinase at

nanomolar concentrations, with an ic50 of 1.2 nm in src
enzymatic assay ( xxxd359xxx  corresponds to compound 31a,
see table 1).21

abl and bcr-abl inhibition
the c-abl gene encodes a highly conserved, ubiquitously
expressed nonreceptor  xxxg2198xxx .22,23 deregulation of
abl kinase activity as a result of bcr-abl translocation as
well as cytoplasmic relocalization causes enhanced cellular
proliferation and reduced apoptosis.24 comparable concentrations of  xxxd359xxx  and imatinib lead to decreased tyrosine
phosphorylation of target proteins. in addition, both compounds inhibit the proliferation of abelson murine leukemia
virus-transformed rat 2 fibroblasts to a similar extent. 25
conversely, the bcr-abl shows enhanced sensitivity to
 xxxd359xxx .  xxxd359xxx  virtually abrogates tyrosine phosphorylation of bcr-abl at concentrations of 25–50 nm, whereas
concentrations of 200 nm are needed to decrease  xxxg23xxx 
phosphorylation to a similar extent.25

additional targets
more than 45 tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases have
been identified as possible targets of  xxxd359xxx  using chemical proteomics and in vitro kinase assays. these kinases
include the apoptosis-linked ste20 kinases and  xxxg329xxx ,
both of which are associated with myeloid leukemia cell
proliferation.26 in addition,  xxxd359xxx  reduces the activity of

clinical potential of  xxxd359xxx 
 xxxd359xxx  shows high clinical potential in first-, second-, and
third-line treatment of chronic phase cml. the different trials carried out for the first-, second-, and third-line settings
are summarized here.

 xxxd359xxx  secondary to imatinib
failure
the efficacy of  xxxd359xxx  secondary to treatment failure
using imatinib in chronic phase cml was evaluated in
a phase i/ii, nonrandomized clinical trial. 12 the study
population included 288 patients with imatinib-resistant
(n = 200) or imatinib-intolerant (n = 88) cml and no other
previous kinase inhibitor exposure. resistance was defined
as no hematological improvement within 4 weeks, no complete hematological response by 3 months, no cytogenetic
response by 6 months, or no major cytogenetic response by
12 months with a daily imatinib dosage of at least 600 mg.
patients were considered imatinib-intolerant when grade
iv hematological toxicities lasted for more than 7 days,
grade 3 and 4 nonhematological toxicities appeared, grade
2 toxicities did not respond to adequate management or to
dose adjustments or when a loss of a previously attained
response appeared on lower-dose imatinib among patients
with previous toxicity.
the primary endpoint of the study, ie, major cytogenetic
response at 24 weeks, was achieved in 31% of patients (33%
in imatinib-resistant patients; 27% in imatinib-intolerant
patients).12 after a median follow-up of 24.2 months, a major
cytogenetic response and a complete cytogenetic response
was reported in 53% and 41% of the evaluable participants,
respectively. dose intensities exceeding 350 mg were associated with increased rates of major cytogenetic response. most
patients (86%) achieved a complete hematological response,
with a median time to complete hematological response of
2 weeks. remarkably, 78% of the patients did not have a
complete hematological response at the time of treatment
initiation with  xxxd359xxx . among patients with a complete
cytogenetic response, 64% of imatinib-resistant and 65%
of imatinib-intolerant patients achieved a major molecular
response. in addition, a complete molecular response (defined
as undetectable bcr-abl, with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction sensitivity of $5 logs) was reported

oncotargets and therapy 2013:6

 xxxd359xxx  and chronic myeloid leukemia

for 49% and 61% of imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant
patients with complete cytogenetic response, respectively.
hematological and cytogenetic responses were examined
in a subgroup of patients with known bcr-abl mutations at the study baseline (n = 115). remarkably, similar
responses were observed across all bcr-abl mutations
when compared with wild-type bcr-abl, with the exception of the highly resistant t315i mutation. patients with
the  xxxd359xxx -resistant v299l mutation were not included
in the study.

 xxxd359xxx  after failure of second/
third-line therapy with  xxxd1815xxx 
and/or  xxxd2724xxx 
safety and efficacy of  xxxd359xxx  as at least third-line treatment
was evaluated in a subpopulation of patients (n = 118) of the
above described multicenter clinical trial.29 all patients had
previously received imatinib and had failed secondary treatment with  xxxd1815xxx  and/or  xxxd2724xxx . in particular, 37 were
resistant and 50 were intolerant to  xxxd1815xxx . an additional
27 patients were resistant to  xxxd2724xxx  and one exhibited
 xxxd2724xxx  intolerance. two patients were resistant to both
 xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx  while one patient was intolerant to
both second-generation  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors.
the median duration of follow-up in the study was
28.5 (0.3–56.2) months. best cumulative cytogenetic and
hematologic responses were as follows. a major cytogenetic response was reported for 31% and 30% of dasatinibresistant or  xxxd1815xxx -intolerant patients, with a complete
cytogenetic response in 14% and 28%, respectively. a major
cytogenetic response and a complete cytogenetic response
were observed in 35% and 27% of individuals harboring
resistance to  xxxd2724xxx , respectively.
a complete hematological response was achieved or
maintained by 73% of patients, including 65% of patients
without a complete hematological response at baseline.
in the fourth-line setting, two of three patients achieved a
conﬁrmed complete hematological response. transformation
to accelerated phase cml occurred in four third-line patients
( xxxd1815xxx -resistant, n = 3;  xxxd2724xxx -resistant, n = 1) and one
fourth-line patient.
response rates were analyzed with respect to the mutational status of bcr-abl. the most frequent bcr-abl
mutations at baseline were f317l, t315i, g250e, and
y253h. a complete hematological response and a major
cytogenetic response were observed broadly across the
bcr-abl mutants, including individuals harboring the
 xxxd1815xxx -resistant f317l, the  xxxd2724xxx -resistant y253h,

and f359c/i/v mutations, but not t315i. nine individuals
developed new mutations in the course of  xxxd359xxx  treatment
(v299l, n = 4; l248v, n = 2; t315i, n = 2; f359c, n = 1;
g250e, n = 1) and eight of these individuals discontinued
 xxxd359xxx  because of progressive disease or unsatisfactory
response. these data are in line with the reported ic50 values
for  xxxd359xxx  in cell lines transfected with bcr-abl mutants
(table 2).

 xxxd359xxx  in first-line therapy
of chronic phase cml
the efficacy of  xxxd359xxx  as upfront therapy for chronic phase
cml was evaluated in the bela ( xxxd359xxx  efficacy and
safety in chronic myeloid leukemia) trial. in this open-label,
randomized, multinational, phase iii clinical trial, 502 patients
were randomized to  xxxd359xxx  500 mg/day (n = 250) or imatinib 400 mg/day (n = 252) after stratification for sokal risk
score and geographic region of the centers.15
surprisingly, the primary endpoint of the study, ie, complete
cytogenetic response at 12 months, was not met because no
superiority of  xxxd359xxx  could be demonstrated over imatinib.
in the intent-to-treat population, the rate of complete cytogenetic response at 12 months was within the same range for
 xxxd359xxx -treated (70%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 64–76)
and imatinib-treated (68%, 95% ci 62–74) patients (p = 0.601).

in contrast, the median time to first complete cytogenetic
response was achieved significantly earlier in patients treated
with  xxxd359xxx  (12.9 weeks, 95% ci 12.6–13.4) when compared
with imatinib (24.6 weeks, 95% ci 24.3–25.6, p , 0.001).15
 xxxd359xxx  was also superior to imatinib concerning
molecular responses. the rate of major molecular remission
at 12 months was significantly higher on  xxxd359xxx  (41%,
95% ci 35–47) than on imatinib (27%, 95% ci 22–33,
p , 0.001) with mr4.0 (molecular remission defined as a
4-log reduction of bcr-abl/abl or  0.01%) (defined as bcrabl/abl # 0.01) in 12% of  xxxd359xxx -treated patients,
but in only 3% of imatinib-treated patients (p , 0.001). in
addition, the first major molecular response was achieved
significantly earlier with  xxxd359xxx  (37.1 weeks, 95% ci
36.1–48.6) than with imatinib (72.3 weeks, 95% ci 61.1
weeks not reached, p , 0.001). in addition, the incidence
of on-treatment progression to accelerated phase or blast
crisis was lower with  xxxd359xxx  (2%, n = 4) compared with
imatinib (4%, n = 10), but this did not reach statistical
significance. kaplan–meier estimates of overall survival at
12 months were greater than 99% in the  xxxd359xxx  arm and
97% in the imatinib arm.15

safety and tolerability
 xxxd359xxx  is generally well tolerated in healthy adult subjects
and in cml patients.30 the hematological toxicity of  xxxd359xxx 
in patients with cml is manageable. as expected, similar to
what was seen in other clinical trials of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in second- and third-line treatment of cml, the rate of
grade 3/4 hematological toxicities increases with the number
of prior therapies. grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was observed
in 14% of patients treated upfront, 25% of patients treated
second-line, and 26% of patients treated third-line, while
neutropenia was reported in 11% of patients treated first-line,
17% of patients treated second-line, and 20% of patients
treated third-line. worsening of anemia was less pronounced,
occurring in 6%, 12%, and 9% of patients treated first-line,
second-line, and third-line, respectively.12,15,29
grade 3/4 neutropenia in cml patients treated first-line was
reduced with  xxxd359xxx  as compared with imatinib (11% versus
24%, respectively) while anemia and thrombocytopenia were
reported at similar frequencies in both treatment groups.
the most frequent nonhematological adverse events
($10%) of  xxxd359xxx  are summarized in table 3.12,15,29
diarrhea was reported in up to 84% of patients. it occurred
predominantly within the first 4 weeks after treatment initiation and was typically of low grade and self-limiting within
a few weeks. however, up to 11% of patients developed

grade 3/4 diarrhea. in the bela trial, diarrhea required
dose interruption or reduction in 21% and 8% of patients on
 xxxd359xxx , respectively, while dose reduction of imatinib was
not necessary in any of the patients, and in only 6% of these
patients did imatinib have to be temporarily discontinued.15
nonhematological laboratory abnormalities included
hyperglycemia, hypermagnesemia, elevations of alanine
transferase and aspartate transferase,  xxxd3472xxx , creatinine,
lipase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as hypocalcemia
and hypophosphatemia.12,15,29 increasing liver enzymes were
associated with a significantly increased rate of treatment discontinuation on  xxxd359xxx  treatment compared with imatinib
in first-line treatment. arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps,
and bone pain, as well as peripheral or periorbital edema,
were observed less frequently in  xxxd359xxx -treated patients
than in imatinib-treated patients.

expert commentary
 xxxd359xxx  shows high clinical efficacy in front-line cml
therapy and were used secondary to treatment failure of
imatinib,  xxxd1815xxx , and/or  xxxd2724xxx . unexpectedly, despite
the superiority of  xxxd359xxx  compared with imatinib in in vitro
and in vivo experiments,25,28 as well as encouraging data from
the phase ii trial,  xxxd359xxx  did not meet the primary endpoint
of the bela trial, showing a similar, but not improved, complete cytogenetic response when compared with imatinib at

12 months.15 one explanation for this nonsuperiority is the
high rate of early treatment discontinuations due to diarrhea
in the primary intent-to-treat study population, and these
patients counted as nonresponders in the final analysis.
however, other reasons for failure of  xxxd359xxx  to induce
higher rates of complete cytogenetic response than imatinib
cannot be excluded, such as the high complete cytogenetic
response rate by 12 months in the imatinib group in the bela
trial (75%) which was higher than that in the enestnd
(evaluating  xxxd2724xxx  efficacy and safety in clinical trialsnewly diagnosed patients) and dasision ( xxxd1815xxx  versus
imatinib study in treatment-naïve cml-cp patients) studies
(65% and 72%,13,14 respectively), possibly due to a different
distribution of risk groups in the study populations. on the
other hand, the rate of major molecular response was significantly higher, and complete cytogenetic response and major
molecular response were achieved more rapidly with  xxxd359xxx  than with imatinib, suggesting that if early treatment
failures can be reduced in the future, patients on  xxxd359xxx 
may achieve both complete cytogenetic response and major
molecular response rates that are superior to those of imatinib.
 xxxd359xxx  is capable of overcoming the vast majority
of imatinib-resistance-conferring bcr-abl mutations,
with the exception of the highly resistant t315i (resistant
to imatinib,  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd359xxx ) and v299l
mutations (resistant to  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd359xxx ) as indicated

by ic50 values of  xxxd359xxx  in vitro (table 2). in patients with
omniresistant mutations, allogeneic stem cell transplantation
and interferon are currently the only approved treatment
options with a potential life prolongation for patients. this is
of particular importance because t315i is predicted to have
an increased clinical impact in the future because of the growing selection pressure on resistant leukemic subclones under
second-line  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor treatment. however,
novel compounds such as the aurora kinase inhibitors, eg,
 xxxd1807xxx  (formerly  xxxd1807xxx ),31  xxxd2783xxx ,32
and  xxxd2985xxx ,33 successfully target the t315i mutation, and
clinical trials are currently being carried out, with the first
results looking very promising, as reviewed elsewhere.34
most interestingly, treatment with  xxxd2985xxx  resulted in a
complete hematological response in 94% and a major cytogenetic response in 63% of the patients in a phase i clinical
trial, with pretreated cml patients including individuals
harboring a t315i mutation.35 these results were recently
confirmed in a larger phase ii study including 449 mostly
heavily pretreated chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast
crisis cml patients, as well as patients with philadelphiapositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with and without the
t315i mutation.33
a decreased incidence of progression to accelerated phase
or blast crisis has been reported for  xxxd359xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx , and
 xxxd2724xxx  when compared with imatinib in upfront therapy,
even though these differences have only been reported to be
statistically significant in the case of  xxxd2724xxx  to date.36 deep
and early molecular remissions due to improved bcr-abl
binding are assumed to play a major role. in the case of
 xxxd359xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , one could hypothesize that inhibition
of src may further improve disease control. remarkably,
while src family tyrosine kinases are of minor importance
for the development of chronic phase cml, they have been
suggested to be involved in progression of the disease.37
indeed, increased expression and/or activation of  xxxg1028xxx  and
lyn were reported in cml patients progressing from chronic
phase to accelerated phase or blast crisis. in addition, the presence of lyn,  xxxg1028xxx , and fgr was found to be essential for the
transition from chronic phase cml to lymphoid blast crisis
in mice.38 interestingly, downregulation of lyn expression by
sirna resulted in apoptosis of bcr-abl-positive blasts, in
particular if lymphoid in nature.39 in addition, philadelphiapositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed in wildtype but not in triple knockout mice (lyn-/-,  xxxg1028xxx -/-, fgr-/-).37
therefore, it is of considerable interest whether  xxxd359xxx 
and  xxxd1815xxx  will reduce the incidence of lymphoid blast
crisis in patients with cml. additionally, the impact of src

kinase inhibition for control of lymphatic blast crisis as well
as philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia should
be evaluated further.
the toxicity profile of  xxxd359xxx  differs distinctly from
the currently approved second-line and second-generation
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in cml, providing an additional therapeutic means for patients with this disease.
this difference may be due to the minimal activity of the dual
src/abl inhibitor against platelet-derived growth factor
receptor and kit, and a different inhibition profile against
other target kinases.16,26,40,41  xxxd359xxx  accounts for significantly less grade 3/4 neutropenia than imatinib in the first-line
setting. interestingly, reduced toxicity of  xxxd359xxx  towards
normal progenitor cells has been found in vitro when compared with imatinib.42,43 in addition, the effects of  xxxd359xxx 
on platelet function are only marginal when compared with
other  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors. while bleeding disorders
(all grades) have been reported in 40% of  xxxd1815xxx -treated
patients, with 10% classified as grade 3/4,44,45 hemorrhagic
events were observed in only 5% of  xxxd359xxx -treated patients,
and only one patient experienced grade 3 bleeding.12 finally,
fluid retention, is observed more often in patients treated with
dasatinib11,14,46,47 or imatinib14,48 than in individuals treated
with  xxxd359xxx .12 given that both  xxxd359xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibit src, inhibition of src alone does not explain the
development of  xxxd1815xxx -induced pleural effusions. similarly, the lymphocytosis seen in approximately one-third of
 xxxd1815xxx -treated patients, and found to carry a positive
prognostic impact, was not observed in  xxxd359xxx -treated
patients.49 in conclusion, due to the novel target profile of
 xxxd359xxx  and the high clinical potential and distinct toxicity
profile,  xxxd359xxx  is an important treatment alternative for
patients with cml.

perspectives for the future
the increasing number of approved  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
complemented by additional compounds that are in preclinical or clinical trials complicates choice of the best strategy
for the individual patient in front- and second-line therapy,
especially given that there are no randomized clinical trials which directly compare the second-generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors with each other. such trials are desirable
and important, but will likely never be performed. thus,
physicians’ choices have to rely on clinical expertise and
will take into account the relevance of potential adverse
events and potential comorbidities in any given individual
patient. longer follow-up is needed to guide us during these
decision processes.

in addition, the definition of critical outcome-associated
diagnostic landmarks during  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor treatment
(likely involving the existing and potentially new polymerase
chain reaction techniques) is very important in continuing to
improve the survival of cml patients.50 the importance of an
early major molecular response for individual life expectancy
has not been finally clarified. however, marin et al reported a
significantly lower 8-year probability of survival for patients
with bcr-abl transcript levels . 9.84% at 3 months.51 in addition, decreased 5-year survival rates were found by hanfstein
et al for patients with bcr-abl levels . 10% according to the
international scale at 3 months.52 in consideration of these
novel results, the upfront use of second-line  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors may be the preferable strategy for patients with a
longer life expectancy.
mutational analyses and comorbidities of the individual
patient will be of major impact for determination of the type
of second- and third-line therapy. also, the decision and
optimal timing of an allogeneic transplant in patients with
cml is still a matter of ongoing debate.
an unresolved issue in the treatment of cml remains the
lack of efficacy of currently available  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors against the quiescent stem cell pool. indeed, alternative
treatment options are required in order to eradicate minimal
residual disease, eg, by induction of apoptosis of leukemic
stem cells.42,53 promising strategies include recruitment of
quiescent leukemia stem cells into the cell cycle in order
to sensitize leukemia stem cells to treatment with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, eg, by therapy with interferon alpha42,53 or
autophagy inhibitors, as reviewed by helgason et al.54 the
steadily increasing knowledge about the biology of cml and
the different drug profiles will determine the treatment strategies used for the individual patient with cml in the future.
