polyamines are ubiquitous organic cations that have been
broadly implicated in modulating ion channels, stimulating cell
proliferation, and facilitating protein synthesis (1–3). acting
alongside mg2⫹, polyamines bind to macromolecular polyanions, especially rna and dna, stabilizing higher order structures (3). although polyamine function and biosynthesis have
been extensively studied in bacteria and eukaryotes, they are
poorly understood in the archaea, where extremophilic organisms may rely on polyamines to stabilize nucleic acid conformations at high temperatures (4, 5).
the euryarchaeal marine methanogen methanococcus vannielii has micromolar concentrations of 1,3-diaminopropane
(0.3 ␮mol/g, dry weight) and  xxxd3043xxx  (putrescine;

3.4 ␮mol/g) and half-millimolar concentrations of n-(3-aminopropyl)- xxxd3043xxx  (spermidine; 29 ␮mol/g) (6). in addition to using polyamines as counterions, these cells require
spermidine to post-translationally modify a lysine residue in
translation initiation factor 5a (7). to biosynthesize spermidine, organisms transfer an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx  to putrescine using an evolutionarily conserved enzyme, propylamine transferase (8).
however, the complete genome sequence of the hyperthermophile methanococcus jannaschii encodes highly diverged sadenosylmethionine synthetase (10) and  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase proteins (11, 12).
cells make putrescine either by decarboxylating  xxxd2793xxx 
or by decarboxylating l-arginine and subsequently hydrolyzing the  xxxd94xxx  product to release urea (13). gene complementation experiments suggest that the two pathways are
functionally interchangeable (14). remarkably, m. jannaschii
has no recognizable homolog of either pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate
(plp)1-dependent enzyme: l- xxxg1626xxx  or l- xxxg232xxx  (15, 16). yet this organism has a homolog of
 xxxd94xxx  ureohydrolase (17), suggesting that putrescine biosynthesis proceeds by the l-arginine decarboxylation pathway.
in this paper, we describe a new class of l- xxxg232xxx  (ec 4.1.1.19) that uses a  xxxd2613xxx  rather than
a plp cofactor to decarboxylate l-arginine to form  xxxd94xxx .
similar to previously characterized pyruvoyl-dependent decarboxylases, the recombinantly expressed mj0316 protein selfcleaves to form a 12-kda (␣) subunit with an amino-terminal
 xxxd2613xxx  and a 5-kda (␤) subunit (18, 19). the resulting
subunits associate to form a highly thermostable and thermoactive (␣␤)3 complex. although the full mj0316 protein has no
significant sequence similarity to any previously characterized
protein, the predicted active site of the mj0316 protein resembles that of the well studied pyruvoyl-dependent  xxxg1040xxx  (20).

the genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic methanogen methanococcus jannaschii contains homologs of
most genes required for spermidine polyamine biosynthesis. yet genomes from neither this organism nor any
other euryarchaeon have orthologs of the pyridoxal 5ⴕphosphate-dependent ornithine or  xxxg232xxx  genes, required to produce putrescine. instead, as
shown here, these organisms have a new class of  xxxg232xxx  (pvlargdc) formed by the self-cleavage of a proenzyme into a 5-kda subunit and a 12-kda
subunit that contains a reactive  xxxd2613xxx . although this extremely thermostable enzyme has no significant sequence similarity to previously characterized
proteins, conserved active site residues are similar to
those of the pyruvoyl-dependent  xxxg1040xxx  enzyme, and its subunits form a similar (␣␤)3 complex. homologs of pvlargdc are found in several bacterial genomes, including those of chlamydia spp., which
have no  xxxd94xxx  ureohydrolase enzyme to convert  xxxd94xxx  (decarboxylated arginine) into putrescine. in
these intracellular pathogens, pvlargdc may function
analogously to pyruvoyl-dependent  xxxg1040xxx ; the cells are proposed to import arginine and
export  xxxd94xxx , increasing the ph and affecting the
host cell’s metabolism. phylogenetic analysis of pvlargdc proteins suggests that this gene has been recruited from the euryarchaeal polyamine biosynthetic
pathway to function as a degradative enzyme in
bacteria.

pyruvoyl  xxxg232xxx 

tives, dissolved in methylene chloride, were analyzed using a vg-70 –
70ehf gc-ms operating at 70 ev equipped with an hp-5 column (0.32
mm ⫻ 30 m) programmed from 80 to 280 °c at 8 °c/min.
quantitative measurement of  xxxg232xxx  activity—one
unit of  xxxg232xxx  activity releases 1 ␮mol/min co2 from l-arginine (22).
standard activity assays included 50 mm mes/naoh (ph 6.0), 50 mm
kcl, 0.5 mm edta, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol (dtt), and enzyme in a
volume of 100 ␮l. buffer salts and enzyme were preincubated at 70 °c
for 10 min before the addition of 10 mm l-arginine hcl and 135 nci of
14
l-[1- c]arginine (55 mci/mmol) (american radiolabeled chemicals).
after a 5–10-min incubation at 70 °c, the reactions were terminated by
the addition of 100 ␮l of 4 m hcl, and 14co2 was collected on 8-mm
diameter circles of whatman no. 1 filter paper soaked with 10 ␮l of a
saturated ba(oh)2 solution (23) and placed in the top of a 1.5-ml
polypropylene microcentrifuge tube. acidified reactions were incubated
at 70 °c for 15 min before filters were removed to vials for liquid
scintillation counting in 1 ml of scintiverse bd fluid (fisher).
temperature, ph, and cofactor effects on pvlargdc activity—
 xxxg232xxx  activity of the purified enzyme was optimized by varying reaction conditions including temperature, ph, and potential cofactors. all
reactions were carried out in enzymatic activity-limited conditions.
effects of reaction temperature were studied in standard assays initiated by the addition of enzyme to reaction mixtures pre-equilibrated in
water or sand baths. reactions were incubated at temperatures from 23
to 90 °c for 10 –12 min and then terminated with hcl. to further test
its thermostability, 10 ␮g of pvlargdc (in 20 ␮l of 50 mm hepes/naoh
(ph 7.1)) was sealed in a melting point capillary tube and then incubated at 125 °c for 30 min.
the influence of ph on  xxxg232xxx  activity was studied using approximately constant ionic strength acetic acid-mes-tris buffers (24). effects
of kcl (fisher), nacl (fisher), nh4cl (fisher), nahco3 (j. t. baker),
mgcl2䡠6h2o (fisher), dtt, pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate, and thiamine pyrophosphate were also tested in standard assays.
kinetic analyses of  xxxg232xxx  activity—initial rates of pvlargdc-catalyzed decarboxylase activity were measured at various concentrations
of l-arginine to infer kinetic parameters. all reactions were preincubated at the reaction temperature before the addition of l-arginine.
assays (100 ␮l) contained 2 ␮g of pvlargdc, ph buffer, 50 mm kcl, 1
mm dtt, 0.5 mm edta, 0.25–15 mm l-arginine, and 50 –150 nci of
14
l-[1- c]arginine (55 mci/mmol). the ph buffers used were 50 mm
trisodium citrate/hcl (ph 4.8), 50 mm mes/naoh (ph 6.0) or 50 mm
hepes/naoh (ph 7.2). initial rate data were fitted to the hyperbolic
michaelis-menten-henri equation, and kinetic parameters were calculated using the levenberg-marquardt method of nonlinear least
squares regression using equal weighting (sigmaplot 2000; spss
science).
inhibitors of  xxxg232xxx  activity—potential inhibitors of  xxxg232xxx  activity
were preincubated in reactions (100 ␮l) containing 39 ␮g/ml pvlargdc.
fixed time point reactions were initiated with 5 mm l-arginine and 100
nci l-[1-14c]arginine (55 mci/mmol), incubated at 70 °c, and terminated after 7 min as described for standard assays. compounds tested
as inhibitors included  xxxd94xxx , l-argininamide, l-arginine methyl ester, putrescine, spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx , cadaverine,  xxxd2429xxx ,  xxxd2282xxx , l-lysine,  xxxd862xxx ,  xxxd2793xxx , l- xxxd2212xxx aspartate, guanidine, methylguanidine hcl, and urea. compounds expected to react
with free pyruvoyl groups were similarly tested as inhibitors: phenylhydrazine hcl, methoxyamine hcl, o-phenylenediamine, and o-(4nitrobenzyl)hydroxylamine hcl (onbh). o-phenylenediamine dissolved in methylene chloride was decolorized with norit a-activated
charcoal (j. t. baker) and crystallized before use.
analytical size exclusion chromatography—protein subunit structure was analyzed using a superose 12hr column (1 ⫻ 30 cm; amersham biosciences). the column was operated and calibrated as described previously (9). eluted protein was detected by its absorbance at
280 nm and  xxxg232xxx  activity.
maldi-tof mass spectrometry of  xxxg232xxx —a saturated solution of
3,5-dimethoxy-4- xxxd1756xxx  matrix was prepared in 50%
(v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. purified  xxxg232xxx 
(0.5 ␮l of a 3.9 mg/ml solution) was mixed with 0.5 ␮l of the matrix
solution on a stainless steel target (shimadzu). dried, crystalline samples were washed with 5 ␮l of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried under
a stream of n2. samples were analyzed in a kratos kompact seq
maldi-tof instrument (shimadzu) operated in the linear mode at 20
kv. for each sample, 50 spectra were collected by scanning across the
sample, and average masses were identified using the combined sample
set. ions of sodium, matrix,  xxxg1618xxx , gramicidin d, bovine pancreas
insulin chain b (oxidized), and horse heart  xxxg569xxx  were used for
mass calibration.

mj0316-fwd (5⬘-ggtcatatgaatgctgagataaac-3⬘) introduced
an ndei restriction site at the 5⬘-end of the amplified dna, whereas
mj0316-rev (5⬘-gatcggatccttatttataccacaatgc-3⬘) introduced a bamhi site at the 3⬘-end. dna fragments were ligated into
compatible sites in plasmids pet19b (novagen) or pt7-7 (21) as described previously (9). recombinant plasmids were transformed into e.
coli bl21-codonplus(de3)-ril (stratagene). sequences of cloned dna
were confirmed by dye-terminator cycle sequencing (university of iowa
dna facility). transformed e. coli cells were grown in complex growth
medium, and recombinant protein expression was induced with 28 mm
␣-lactose (9). cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation
(6,000 ⫻ g, 10 min) and were frozen at ⫺30 °c.
purification of the pvlargdc protein—recombinant pyruvoyldependent  xxxg232xxx  (pvlargdc) protein was purified
from soluble cell-free extract by heat treatment and chromatography. e.
coli cells (1.1 g, wet weight) expressing pvlargdc from the pt7-7derived plasmid were suspended in 6 ml of buffer a (20 mm tris/hcl
(ph 7.6)) and lysed by sonication. soluble cell-free extract was obtained
after centrifugation at 16,000 ⫻ g for 10 min at 25 °c. native e. coli
proteins were denatured by heating the soluble extract at 70 °c for 20
min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 °c
(16,000 ⫻ g, 10 min). heat-soluble cell-free extract (5 ml) was applied to
a deae-sepharose ff column (16 mm ⫻ 5.2 cm; amersham biosciences) equilibrated in buffer a. protein was eluted with a 30-ml
linear gradient from 0 to 1 m nacl in buffer a at a flow rate of 0.5
ml/min. fractions (1.0 ml) containing  xxxg232xxx  activity (which eluted
from 0.1 to 0.4 m nacl) were pooled and sealed in an mr 8000 cut-off
membrane (spectrum). protein was dialyzed against buffer b (20 mm
bis-tris/hcl (ph 6.5)) for 10 h at 4 °c and then concentrated in the
membranes using polyethyleneglycol 8000.
concentrated protein was loaded onto a uno q strong anion exchange column (7 ⫻ 35 mm; biorad) equilibrated in buffer b, and
protein was eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1 m nacl in
buffer b at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. fractions containing activity
(which eluted from 0.2 to 0.3 m nacl) were pooled and concentrated in
a centricon-10 ultrafiltration unit (millipore corp.). concentrated protein was applied to a sephacryl s-200hr size exclusion column (16
mm ⫻ 60 cm; amersham biosciences) equilibrated in buffer c, which
contained 150 mm nacl and 50 mm hepes adjusted to ph 7.2 with
naoh. chromatography was performed in buffer c at a flow rate of 0.5
ml/min, and  xxxg232xxx  activity eluted maximally at 57 ml. fractions
containing protein were pooled and concentrated in an n2-pressurized
stirred cell with a ym10 ultrafiltration membrane (millipore) and then
stored at 4 °c.
protein purity was evaluated by sds-page with diamine or nondiamine (bio-rad) silver staining. protein sizes were analyzed using sdspolyacrylamide gels with either a tris/glycine buffer system (12% t,
2.7% c acrylamide) or a tris/tricine buffer system (12% t, 3.3% c
acrylamide). protein concentrations were measured using the bca
total protein assay (pierce) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
recombinant protein expressed with an amino-terminal  xxxd2282xxx 
tag (pvlargdchis) was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (9).
qualitative analysis of amino acid decarboxylase activity—to
screen compounds as substrates for the m. jannaschii pvlargdc, amino
acids were incubated with enzyme, and the products were analyzed by
thin layer chromatography (tlc). purified pvlargdc enzyme (1 ␮g)
was incubated with 10 mm amino acid and 50 mm mes/naoh (ph 6.0)
in a volume of 20 ␮l at 70 °c for 20 min. reaction mixtures (2 ␮l) were
spotted onto a silica gel 60 tlc plate (5 ⫻ 10 cm; em science) and
developed in a solvent system containing acetonitrile/water/ xxxd2154xxx 
(88%) at a volumetric ratio of 80:20:10. plates were dried, sprayed with
ninhydrin reagent (0.2% (w/v) in ethanol), and then heated to visualize
amines and amino acids. amino acids tested as substrates included
g
l-argininamide, l- xxxd862xxx arginine, n -methyl-l- xxxd220xxx arginine methyl ester,  xxxd233xxx , l- xxxd416xxx , dl-␣-⑀-diaminopimelate,
 xxxd2429xxx , l- xxxd2431xxx glutamine,  xxxd2282xxx , l-lysine, and  xxxd2793xxx . stock solutions of amino acids were dissolved in water and
adjusted to neutral ph with hcl or naoh.
to confirm the identities of decarboxylated amino acids, trifluoroacetyl derivatives of reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). reactions (100 ␮l) containing 8
␮g of pvlargdc, 50 mm nh4oac, and 10 mm l-arginine, ng-methyl-larginine, or l- xxxd416xxx  were incubated at 80 °c for 30 min. reactions
were evaporated to dryness by heating under a stream of n2 before the
addition of ⬃100 ␮l of trifluoroacetic anhydride (50% (v/v)) in methylene

identification, expression, and purification of m. jannaschii
pvlargdc—the complete genome sequence of m. jannaschii
encodes a single member of the plp-dependent family of enzymes that decarboxylate amino acids at the c-␣ position,
which includes the canonical  xxxg232xxx  enzyme
(15, 31). the protein encoded by this locus (mj1097) is most
similar to bacterial diaminopimelate decarboxylases. we have
demonstrated that the recombinantly expressed mj1097 enzyme decarboxylates dl-␣-⑀-diaminopimelate (to produce l-lysine) but does not decarboxylate l-arginine or  xxxd2793xxx .2
therefore, m. jannaschii must have a noncanonical means
of producing putrescine that is required for spermidine
biosynthesis.
a cluster of genes in the m. jannaschii genome encodes all of
the proteins required for polyamine biosynthesis from metabolic intermediates.  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase (locus mj0315) (11, 12), a homolog of spermidine synthase
(mj0313), a homolog of  xxxd94xxx  ureohydrolase (mj0309) (17),
and a previously uncharacterized open reading frame (mj0316)
are conserved in most euryarchaeal genomes. this group of
genes that are required for polyamine biosynthesis suggested
that the mj0316-encoded protein could be an  xxxg232xxx . this protein sequence has no significant similarity to
characterized proteins in sequence databases; nor do homologs
of mj0316 share any conserved lysine residue required to bind
a plp. however, members of this family of uncharacterized
proteins have conserved serine-serine residues similar to the
 xxxd2613xxx -forming cleavage site of some  xxxg1040xxx  enzymes (32, 33).
e. coli cells that expressed the m. jannaschii mj0316 gene
from a strong promoter produce large amounts of recombinant
protein, comprising ⬃10% of the cells’ total soluble protein.
protein purification by heating (to denature most native e. coli
proteins), anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography
removed most contaminating proteins and nucleic acids. table
i shows the purification of 8 mg of mj0316 protein from 1.1 g
(wet mass) recombinant e. coli. the enzyme is soluble at concentrations of at least 4 mg/ml, and it retained 80% activity
when stored for 8 months at 4 °c in 50 mm hepes/naoh (ph

chemical synthesis of modified pyruvoyl peptide—t-butoxycarbonylwas coupled with ␣-amino-␥-butyrolactone䡠hbr in the presence of triethylamine and n-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline in a dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran solvent mixture
to form the n-t-butoxycarbonyl- xxxd2394xxx -homoserine lactone peptide
(25). the resulting dipeptide was deprotected with 3 m hcl in ethyl
acetate (26) and then coupled, using n-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2dihydroquinoline, with the onbh oxime derivative of  xxxd3055xxx . the
oxime was formed by the condensation of onbh hydrochloride with
 xxxd3055xxx  in pyridine. the resulting peptide was purified by preparative tlc using ethyl acetate as the solvent. the peptide derivative had
␭max at 268 nm and had a partition coefficient between ethyl acetate
and water of 26. 1h nmr and cosy analysis of the peptide was
consistent with the assigned structure and confirmed that the peptide
consisted of four isomers resulting from the presence of the racemic
homoserine lactone and the cis- and trans-oximes. mass spectral analysis by electron impact (70 ev) gave a m⫹ of 434 m/z. the peptide was
also analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (lc-esi-ms) on a lcqdecaxp instrument (thermofinnigan). analysis of a sample dissolved in water and separated on a
c18 column (phenomenex) showed a peak with a mh⫹ ion at 453.1 m/z,
indicating that the lactone had undergone ring opening. tandem mass
spectrometry identified a b2-type ion (333.8 m/z) and an a2-type ion
(305.9 m/z), both derived from the 453.1 m/z molecular ion.
derivatization and identification of a  xxxd2613xxx -containing
peptide from pvlargdc—to a sample containing 300 ␮g of pvlargdc in
100 ␮l of 40 mm hepes/naoh (ph 7.2) was added 0.5 ␮mol of onbh
(fig. 1). the reaction was incubated at 75 °c for 30 min. the sample
was cooled to room temperature before the addition of 25 ␮mol of
nh4hco3 and 93 ␮mol of  xxxd26xxx . protein was incubated
under an atmosphere of n2 for 12 h before the sample was evaporated
to dryness under a stream of n2. protein was resuspended in 200 ␮l 70%
(w/v)  xxxd2154xxx  with a small amount of cyanogen bromide (27). after
a 12-h incubation at room temperature, the sample was evaporated to
dryness under a stream of n2, suspended in 200 ␮l of water, and
extracted with 150 ␮l of ethyl acetate. the organic phase, containing
the onbh-pvl-ile-hse peptide (fig. 1), was evaporated to dryness
under a stream of n2, and the residue was resuspended in water for
lc-esi-ms analysis as described above.
identification of  xxxg232xxx  homologs, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic inference—the translated sequence of the m. jannaschii gene
mj0316 (swiss-prot accession number q57764) was used in iterative
queries of the nonredundant protein data base at the national center
for biotechnology information using the blastp program (version
2.2.1) (28) with the blossum62 matrix and default gap costs for
existence—11 and extension—1. homologs (and their genbank™/ebi
accession numbers) were identified in the archaea archaeoglobus fulgidus (aab88952.1 and aab91232.1), halobacterium sp. (aag20170.1),
methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (aab85368.1), pyrococcus furiosus (aal81747.1) and thermoplasma acidophilum (cac11909.1)
and in the bacteria chlamydophila pneumoniae (aaf38615.1) and
chlamydia trachomatis (aac67969.1). additional homologs were identified in incomplete genomic sequences from ferroplasma acidarmanus
and methanosarcina barkeri (department of energy joint genome
institute; available on the world wide web at www.jgi.doe.gov), porphyromonas gingivalis (sanger institute sequencing group; available
on the world wide web at www.sanger.ac.uk), methanococcus maripaludis (university of washington; available on the world wide web at
www.genome.washington.edu/methanococcus.html), and chlorobium
tepidum and carboxyldothermus hydrogenoformans (the institute for
genomic research; available on the world wide web at www.tigr.org).
amino acid sequences were aligned automatically using the clustalw program (version 1.82) (29). from the alignment of 17 protein
sequences, 165 positions were deemed to be confidently aligned. these
were analyzed by protein maximum likelihood methods using the
proml program (30) with the jtt amino acid substitution model.
bootstrap proportions were calculated using seqboot, proml, and conl-isoleucine

inhibitors of  xxxg232xxx  activity—substrate and product analogs
were tested for their ability to inhibit pvlargdc activity at
70 °c in reactions containing 5 mm l-arginine. the most effective inhibitors of  xxxg232xxx  activity were arginine analogs: largininamide and l-arginine methyl ester substantially abolished  xxxg232xxx  activity at 5 mm concentrations. other basic
amino acids,  xxxd2429xxx ,  xxxd2793xxx ,  xxxd2282xxx , l-lysine, and

sample of  xxxd94xxx . derivatives of enzyme reaction product
formed from ng-methyl-l-arginine included the di- to pentatrifluoroacetyl derivatives of ng-methylagmatine. molecular and
fragment ions of ng-methylagmatine-trifluoroacetyl derivatives were 14 m/z units higher than peaks from their respective
 xxxd94xxx -trifluoroacetyl derivatives. finally, the ditrifluoroacetyl derivative of decarboxylated l- xxxd416xxx  was identified
by its molecular ion (m⫹ ⫽ 324 m/z), and a tetratrifluoroacetyl
derivative (m⫹ ⫽ 516 m/z) was inferred from fragment ions.
no decarboxylation products were detected in tlc analyses of
reactions including enzyme and  xxxd862xxx ,  xxxd233xxx ,  xxxd2429xxx ,  xxxd2282xxx , l-lysine, or  xxxd2793xxx . because the
mj0316 protein specifically decarboxylates l-arginine using a
 xxxd2613xxx  (described below), this enzyme is the first described pvlargdc.
optimization of enzyme activity—in standard assays of l-[114
c] xxxg232xxx  activity, purified pvlargdc had a
specific activity of 2.5 units/mg and required no exogenous
cofactors for full activity. the purified enzyme contained no
detectable plp (measured by uv-visible absorbance spectroscopy), and the addition of 0.1 mm plp had no effect on the
enzyme’s  xxxg232xxx  activity. nor did additions of 5 mm thiamine
pyrophosphate, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm dithionite, 5 mm
mgcl2, 25–200 mm kcl, 50 mm nacl, or 50 mm nh4cl affect
activity. although neither 0.5 mm edta nor 1 mm dtt enhanced activity, both were included in standard reactions,
along with 50 mm kcl, to minimize potential variation in
activity.
assays of  xxxg232xxx  activity at varying ph showed that pvlargdc has maximum specific activity at ph 6.0, although the
enzyme has significant activity over the range of physiologically relevant ph values (fig. 2). the pvlargdc enzyme is both
thermoactive and thermostable; specific activity increases at
higher temperatures up to 90 °c (the practical limit for the
 xxxg232xxx  assay). enzyme heated in an autoclave for 20 min at
121 °c retained 50% activity when assayed at 70 °c. when
heated for 30 min at 125 °c in a sealed glass capillary tube, it
retained 16% activity.
kinetic analyses of  xxxg232xxx  activity—to measure the kinetic
properties of pvlargdc, initial reaction rates were calculated
from measurements of 14co2 released at various l-[1-14c]arginine concentrations. although the  xxxd94xxx  reaction product
inhibits  xxxg232xxx  activity (discussed below), product accumulation did not significantly affect initial rate measurements.
therefore,  xxxg232xxx  activity data were fit to the michaelis-menten-henri first-order rate equation. at ph 6.0 and 70 °c, kinetic parameters (and their s.e.) were km ⫽ 4.7 ⫾ 0.6 mm and

m/z and 5440 m/z that correspond to the
␤-subunit formed from the amino-terminal residues of the proenzyme during protein cleavage. a 12,379 m/z ion in the
pvlargdc spectrum corresponds to the

forms an oxime derivative of the ␣-subunit (broken line in the inset) that is 145

proteolysis by e. coli methionyl aminopeptidase gives rise to both ␤-subunit

that are invariant in both spectra. all ions
are identified by their average mass/

silver diamine-stained gel (12% t, 3.3% c) of pvlargdc using a tris/
tricine buffer system (lanes 2– 4). pvlargdc incubated alone at 80 °c
for 20 min forms two high molecular weight bands (lane 2) that substantially dissociate into the low molecular weight band in identical
samples incubated with 2.5 mm onbh (lane 3) or 2.5 mm methoxyamine (lane 4). pvlargdc samples (10 ␮g) and protein standards (not
shown) were heated in sds-page loading buffer at 100 °c for 5 min
before electrophoresis.

sds-polyacrylamide gel resolved three bands with apparent
molecular masses of 57, 25, and 11 kda (fig. 5, lane 2).
the two fast migrating bands (5–7 and 11–13 kda) correspond to the ␤- and ␣-subunits of pvlargdc, respectively. the
two slow migrating bands may correspond to nondenatured
forms of pvlargdc, similar to those observed for the pyruvoyldependent  xxxd233xxx -␣⫺decarboxylase (39). besides being remarkably thermostable, pvlargdc retains full activity in the
presence of 1% (w/v) sds at 70 °c; therefore, the enzyme may
not denature during standard sds-page sample preparation
procedures. this enzyme also resists proteolytic cleavage by
trypsin, pepsin, carboxylpeptidase a, or papain, although the
slowly migrating bands were cleaved in samples treated with
␣-chymotrypsin or proteinase k. when pvlargdc was heated
with onbh or methoxyamine prior to electrophoresis, the high

nidine and methylguanidine reduced activity by at least 50% at
5–10 mm concentrations. low concentrations of urea (10 –20
mm) had no effect on activity, although 4 m urea reduced activity by 80%.
pvlargdc activity was also inhibited by  xxxd94xxx  at a 50%
inhibitory concentration of 1.4 ⫾ 0.1 mm, in the presence of 5
mm l-arginine. polyamines putrescine, spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx ,
and cadaverine did not affect activity ( xxxd1891xxx  mm concentrations). as expected for a pyruvoyl-dependent enzyme, reagents
that react with ketones to form covalent adducts were potent
inhibitors. preincubation with 10 mm phenylhydrazine (32), 5
mm methoxyamine, 5 mm o-phenylenediamine (36), or 5 mm
onbh reduced activity by more than 90%.
subunit composition of pvlargdc—pyruvoyl-dependent
proenzymes self-cleave at a serine residue to form a large
subunit (␣) that contains the nascent  xxxd2613xxx  and a
small subunit (␤) that includes the amino-terminal residues of
the proenzyme (37). purified pvlargdc analyzed by malditof mass spectrometry (three experiments with separate calibrations) identified three ions: 12,356 ⫾ 57 m/z, 5436 ⫾ 11
m/z, and 5301 ⫾ 14 m/z (fig. 4). the largest ion corresponds to
the predicted ␣⫺subunit (expected mr ⫽ 12,272). derivatization with onbh shifts this ion by 145 m/z, close to the expected
increase of 152 m/z (fig. 4). the smaller ions correspond to the
predicted ␤⫺subunit (expected mr ⫽ 5435) and the aminoterminal methionine-cleaved ␤⫺subunit (expected mr ⫽ 5294).
maldi-tof analysis of pvlargdchis, containing an aminoterminal  xxxd2282xxx  tag, formed 12,246 and 8054 m/z ions,
which correspond to the ␣⫺subunit and ␤his⫺subunit (expected mr ⫽ 8192). no ion corresponding to the mj0316 proenzyme
(expected mr ⫽ 17,710) was detected. these results indicate
that cleavage of the mj0316 proenzyme between amino acids
ser52 and ser53 forms active pvlargdc.
purified pvlargdc preparations show three distinct bands
on an sds-polyacrylamide gel; these proteins had apparent
molecular masses of 44, 17, and 13 kda (fig. 5, lane 1). migrations of the two largest bands change relative to denatured
protein standards depending on the gels’ acrylamide and crosslinker compositions. a diffuse band, with an apparent molecular mass of 7 kda, was not detected by diamine silver staining
but was visible by nondiamine silver nitrate staining (38),
presumably due to the lack of cysteine residues in the ␤-subunit of pvlargdc. separation on a more highly cross-linked

from a sepharose 12hr size exclusion column, both pvlargdc and pvlargdchis eluted with stokes radii of 30 å,
corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 55,900 da.
this elution profile suggests that pvlargdc has a (␣␤)3 subunit
composition.
cnbr cleavage and peptide identification—to confirm the
site of protein cleavage deduced from maldi-tof ms measurements, the onbh derivative of pvlargdc was cleaved with
cnbr, and the resulting derivative of the pyruvoyl-isoleucylhomoserine lactone peptide (fig. 1) was analyzed by lc-esims. the ion profile of the molecular ion mh⫹ ⫽ 453 m/z eluting
from a reversed phase column was consistent with that of
synthetic peptide (maximum intensity at 21.1 min).
sequence analysis of  xxxg232xxx  homologs and phylogenetic inference—in an alignment of the m. jannaschii pvlargdc amino
acid sequence with several homologous sequences, most amino
acid positions are not conserved (fig. 6). however, residues
near the site of protein cleavage (ser52–ser53) are conserved in
pvlargdc homologs and correspond to conserved residues near
the cleavage site of the lactobacillus 30a pyruvoyl-dependent
 xxxg1040xxx  (pvlhisdc-ser81–ser82) (40). a position containing conserved hydrophobic residues (leu31) corresponds to the substrate binding pocket lid of  xxxg1040xxx  (pvlhisdc-ile59) (20, 41). the pvlargdc amino acid
phe34 corresponds to pvlhisdc-tyr62. a y62f mutant of pvlhisdc retains activity but has a higher km than wild-type
enzyme (41). finally the pvlargdc asp35 aligns with pvl-

hisdc-asp63, which has been proposed to form an ion pair with
the imidazolium side chain of that enzyme’s  xxxd2282xxx  substrate (41). in the  xxxg232xxx , the aspartyl side
chain could form an equivalent ion pair with the guanidino
group of arginine and  xxxd94xxx .
outside of the active site region, no residues are conserved
between pvlargdc and pvlhisdc sequences. two positions
(pvlhisdc-asp53 and -asp198) implicated in the ph regulatory
mechanism of  xxxg1040xxx  cooperativity are notably absent from pvlargdc sequences (35, 42).
the phylogeny of pvlargdc homologs was inferred using
maximum likelihood criteria from a short alignment of 17
highly diverged sequences (fig. 7). the distribution of homologs from all euryarchaeal genomes is consistent with vertical inheritance of the gene from an ancestor of the euryarchaeal lineage. three paralogs in a. fulgidus and two
paralogs in m. barkeri resulted from separate gene duplication
events in each lineage. one of the a. fulgidus paralogs is
severely truncated and may be a pseudogene (not shown in fig.
7). the bacterial homologs of pvlargdc are particularly interesting; the phylogenetic tree suggests at least three independent lateral gene transfer events. the homolog in the hydrothermal vent bacterium c. hydrogenoformans is most similar to
genes from hydrothermal vent-dwelling archaea. the gene in
the moderately thermophilic green sulfur bacterium c. tepidium resembles genes from the archaeoglobus/methanosarcina lineage. finally, highly diverged pvlargdc homologs in
the bacterial pathogens p. gingivalis and chlamydia spp. may
be products of an ancient gene transfer and a rapid rate of
protein evolution. the phylogeny of pvlargdc homologs in-

discussion

amino acids are not only substrates for protein synthesis and
foodstuffs for heterotrophic organisms but are also the feed
stock for numerous cofactor biosyntheses. some of the simplest
putative neurotransmitters and molecular signals ( xxxd94xxx ,
␥-aminobutyrate, dopamine, ethanolamine, histamine, taurine, and tyramine) are all formed by eukaryotic plp-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. in methanogenic archaea, tyramine is a precursor of the cofactor methanofuran (43),
␤-alanine may be a pantothenate precursor (44), and  xxxd94xxx 
is required for polyamine biosyntheses. for the decarboxylation of  xxxd2282xxx  and now l-arginine, both plp-dependent and
pyruvoyl-dependent decarboxylases have been identified. because modern organisms, including m. jannaschii, use plp as
a cofactor in numerous amino acid reactions, it is surprising
that pyruvoyl-dependent amino acid decarboxylases are so
widespread.
by analogy with other pyruvoyl-dependent enzymes, the pvlargdc proenzyme self-cleaves by nonhydrolytic serinolysis at a
serine-serine peptide bond to form an ␣-subunit (with a catalytic  xxxd2613xxx ) and a ␤-subunit (with substrate-binding
residues) (45). yet none of the previously identified families of
pyruvoyl-dependent enzymes appear to be related. both pvlargdc and pvlhisdc form trimers, and both share a similar
set of conserved residues near the catalytic site of protein
cleavage and  xxxd2613xxx  formation. although these features suggest that the two genes share a common ancestor, the
lack of significant sequence similarity outside of this active site
region requires a structural model of pvlargdc to test the
relationship.
an  xxxg232xxx  from the oat plant is also activated by proteolytic cleavage (46). unlike pvlargdc, that enzyme requires a separate protease to cleave the recombinant
protein, and it has significant sequence similarity to the plpdependent e. coli biosynthetic  xxxg232xxx  spea.
therefore, the oat enzyme is not homologous to pvlargdc.
both pyruvoyl-dependent enzymes and their plp-dependent
analogs have similar reaction mechanisms (19), and both
groups have comparable kinetic properties (table ii). compared with the spea biosynthetic  xxxg232xxx  from e. coli, pvlargdc has a similar turnover number but a much higher km.
in contrast to the spea enzyme, pvlargdc is not feedbackinhibited by putrescine or spermidine end products (47). therefore, the high km of pvlargdc could be advantageous for an
anaerobic, autotrophic organism with no apparent means to
oxidatively degrade or recycle polyamines.

in a related comparison, the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine
decarboxylase of lactobacillus sp. 30a has similar kinetic properties to its plp-dependent analog from morganella morganii
(table ii). however, only the activity of the pyruvoyl-dependent enzyme is exquisitely regulated by ph (34, 48). although
most proton-consuming decarboxylation reactions are faster at
acidic ph, low ph specifically stabilizes an ion pair between
asp198 of the pvlhisdc ␣-subunit and asp53 of an adjacent
␤-subunit to align active site residues (35). this ion pair is not
conserved in pvlargdc.
in contrast to the pvlhisdc proteins, pvlargdc homologs
are found in many microbes, including all euryarchaea and
several bacterial lineages. homologs in the intracellular pathogens chlamydia spp. are particularly interesting, because numerous pathogenic microorganisms use host cell l-arginine as
an energy or nitrogen source. yet genomes of chlamydia spp.
have no recognizable genes for arginine (or  xxxd94xxx ) catabolism other than pvlargdc. instead, in those genomes, the
pvlargdc genes are adjacent to genes encoding basic amino
acid permease transporters that are similar to the arginine/
ornithine antiporter (arcd from pseudomonas aeruginosa) and
the putrescine/ornithine antiporter (pote from e. coli). therefore, chlamydia spp. could take up arginine (and a proton) and
decarboxylate it to produce and export  xxxd94xxx . in addition to
depleting the host cell’s arginine pool, such a system would
raise the extracellular ph and introduce significant amounts of
 xxxd94xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase and a suppressor of apoptosis (49, 50). the genome of clostridium perfringens
encodes a similar amino acid permease gene adjacent to a
homolog of pvlhisdc (51). as observed in lactobacillus sp.
30a, c. perfringens may import histidine and excrete the decarboxylated product, raising the extracellular ph (52, 53).
geneticists have long appreciated the importance of microbial operons in co-regulating gene expression (54). yet comparative genome analyses have unveiled clusters of functionally
related genes whose breadth exceeded expectations (55). combined with a comparative analysis of gene distribution in organisms of known phenotype, gene cluster analysis led us to
identify the novel  xxxg232xxx  described here. furthermore, the same type of analysis led us to propose a completely different physiological function for pvlargdc homologs
in pathogenic bacteria.
this finding of a pyruvoyl-dependent  xxxg232xxx 
revisits the redundancy in nature of having both plp and
pyruvoyl-dependent amino acid decarboxylases (19). an attractive model for evolutionarily primitive decarboxylation reactions, pyruvoyl cofactors are formed by acyl rearrangement
reactions that are conserved in protein cleavage and splicing
mechanisms (56). yet plp is pervasive in modern organisms,

pyruvoyl  xxxg232xxx 
and plp-dependent enzymes should be less susceptible to
costly substrate-mediated transamination side reactions that
inactivate amino acid decarboxylases.
