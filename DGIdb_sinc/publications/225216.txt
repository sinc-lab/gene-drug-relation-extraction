abstract. the psoriatic epidermis is more active metabolically and its rate of proli-
feration is faster, showing incomplete differentiation as a result of the imbalance between
the low level of  xxxd1773xxx  and the high level of  xxxd1274xxx . the low  xxxd1773xxx  levels
are due to hyperactivity of the phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes  xxxd1773xxx . xanthine
derivatives are found to be potent phosphodiesterase inhibitors. 15 psoriatic patients were
treated with tablets of xanthine derivatives ( xxxd1958xxx ,  xxxd150xxx ). the obtained
results are discussed.

the psoriatic epidermis, in comparison to normal epidermis, is more
active metabolically, its rate of proliferation is faster and its terminal differen-
tiation incomplete. voorhees and duell [1] and rudland et al. [2] have found
that high levels of  xxxd1773xxx  in the epidermis inhibit cell division and en-
hance differentiation, while high levels of  xxxd1274xxx  and low levels of cyclic
amp have the opposite effect. according to voorhees and duell’s findings,
the epidermal cells of psoriatic lesions show increased levels of  xxxd1274xxx 
and decreased levels of  xxxd1773xxx , and the steady state of normal epidermis
is kept by a homeostatic mechanism which seems to be the result of a bal-
anced ratio of  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx .

wallach and schmidt-ulrich [8] have shown that the levels of intra-
cellular  xxxd1773xxx  are determined by the rate of its formation from atp
by adenylate cyclase and the rate of its destruction by  xxxd1773xxx  phospho-
diesterase and by its leakage from the cell. it seems, therefore, logical to use
phosphodiesterase inhibitors attempting to balance the  xxxd1773xxx /cyclic
gmp intracellular ratio of the psoriatic lesion, thus achieving a homeostatic

stage. xanthine derivatives have been shown to be potent epidermal phos-
phodiesterase inhibitors [4-7].

this short preliminary report shows the effect and limitations of a per os
administration of xanthine derivatives —  xxxd150xxx  and  xxxd1958xxx  — in
psoriatic patients. no other local or systemic treatment has been given to
these patients.

results

15 patients were treated. table ia shows the successfully treated patients and table ib
the patients who failed to respond.

patients 1, 7 and 8 (table ia) received treatment first with  xxxd150xxx  for 1, 2 and
2 months, respectively; then, the treatment was changed to  xxxd1958xxx  because of their
complaint of dizziness and nausea. patient 5 was admitted from the emergency room
suffering from generalized erythrodermia psoriatica. the erythrodermia subsided after
four injections of 10, 15 and 25 mg of methotrexate. 10 days after the last injection, we
put him on a  xxxd1958xxx  treatment. patient 7 responded to treatment with  xxxd150xxx 
and also with  xxxd1958xxx  very slowly; part of the lesions were entirely absorbed, and part

are still in the stage of absorption. the patient did not suffer from side-effects in spite of
the long duration of the treatment with  xxxd1958xxx  which still continues. patients 3 and 7
(table ib) had relatively limited areas of psoriasis. patients 1, 2 and 4 suffered from ex-
tensive lesions of psoriasis geographica, and patients 5 and 6 developed erythrodermia
and pustular lesions; in addition, patients 4, 5 and 6 suffered from severe dryness of the
skin during  xxxd1958xxx  treatment.

discussion

from the results obtained, it seems that these xanthine derivatives have
a limited effect and that not every psoriatic patient will respond to this
treatment. patients with widespread and active psoriatic lesions, with a
tendency to develop erythrodermia or pustular lesions, reacted with a high
degree of skin dryness which produce a very uncomfortable feeling. a patient
with a history of erythrodermia and recurring widespread psoriatic lesions
reacted to  xxxd1958xxx  treatment with dryness of almost all the skin surface,
edema of the lower limbs, particularly legs and feet, and with high tempera-
ture. all these side-effects subsided in about 10 days after discontinuation of
treatment and without antibiotics. the patient was then treated with metho-
trexate.

the treatment was also without effect in the two cases of psoriasis
geographica which covered large skin areas. since the psoriatic lesions are
a proliferative reaction to the  xxxd1773xxx / xxxd1274xxx  imbalance, psoriasis
might be considered a benign, superficial, proliferative skin-tumor-like con-
dition, and it seems, therefore, that a relationship exists between xanthine
dose and tumor load. although this assumption may explain the failure of
this treatment in widespread and psoriasis geographica cases, it cannot ex-
plain the failure in a patient with relatively limited lesions in the arms and
left thigh.

therefore, it can be concluded that other factors such as degree of
absorption or interference with the inhibitory effect of xanthine derivatives
against phosphodiesterase at the cellular level of the psoriatic lesion might
exist.

it is important to note that  xxxd1958xxx  was administered in high dosages,
and no significant side-effects have been observed. the liver function of the
patients was normal during treatment, and only occasionally patients com-
plained of dizziness, nausea and headache. we feel, therefore, that elucida-
tion and neutralization of possible interfering factors to this treatment may
lead to a very comfortable treatment for most psoriatic patients.
