abstract
we previously showed that hiv-1 protease inhibitors (pis) slowed the
proliferation of human myeloid leukemia cells and enhanced their differentiation in the presence of all–trans- xxxd3417xxx . in this study, we found
that pis, including ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir, inhibited the
growth of du145 and pc-3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cells as
measured by a clonal proliferation assay. recent studies showed that
ritonavir inhibited  xxxg590xxx  enzyme (cyp3a4) in liver microsomes. the cyp3a4 is involved in drug metabolism and acquisition of
drug resistance. to clarify the drug interaction between ritonavir and
other anticancer drugs, we cultured du145 cells with docetaxel either
alone or in combination with ritonavir. ritonavir enhanced the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of docetaxel in the hormonally independent du145 prostate cancer cells in vitro as measured by the clonogenic soft agar assay and detection of the activated form of caspase-3 and
cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase using western blot analysis.
real-time pcr showed that docetaxel induced the expression of cyp3a4
at the transcriptional level, and ritonavir (10ⴚ5 mol/l) completely blocked
this induction. an elisa-based assay also showed that ritonavir inhibited
dna binding activity of nuclear factor ␬b (nf␬b) in du145 cells, which
is a contributor to drug resistance in cancer cells. furthermore, combination treatment of docetaxel and ritonavir dramatically inhibited the
growth of du145 cells present as tumor xenografts in  xxxd300xxx  nude mice
compared with either drug alone. importantly, docetaxel induced expression of cyp3a4 in du145 xenografts, and ritonavir completely blocked
this induction. ritonavir also inhibited nf␬b dna binding activity in
du145 xenografts. extensive histologic analyses of the liver, spleen, kidneys, bone marrow, skin, and subcutaneous fat pads from these mice
showed no abnormalities. in summary, combination therapy of ritonavir
and anticancer drugs holds promise for the treatment of individuals with
advanced, drug resistant cancers.

introduction

protease. we previously found that saquinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir
induced growth arrest and differentiation of nb4 and hl-60 human
myelocytic leukemia cells and enhanced the ability of all–trans-retinoic
acid (atra) to decrease proliferation and increase differentiation of
these cells (4). other investigators have shown that pis can decrease
proliferation of kaposi’s sarcoma and prostate cancer cells via inhibition
of nuclear factor ␬b (nf␬b) activity (5–7). we also have recently found
that pis induced growth arrest and apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells
via inhibition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling (8).
pis are metabolized by  xxxg590xxx  (cyp3a4) in liver
microsomes (9). interestingly, among the pis, only ritonavir showed
strong cyp3a4 inhibitory effects. noting this activity, investigators
have coadministered ritonavir with saquinavir and found markedly
elevated and sustained plasma levels of saquinavir in rat and dog
models. this occurred, supposedly, by inhibiting metabolism of saquinavir (10), and this combination is clinically used for individuals
with hiv infection (11). on the basis of the pharmacokinetics of
ritonavir, a coformulated agent containing lopinavir and ritonavir has
been developed: low doses of ritonavir enhanced the activity of
lopinavir (12), and this formulation is being used for first-line therapy
for some hiv-infected individuals. collectively, we hypothesized that
ritonavir might enhance the antitumor activity of docetaxel, the latter
being a substrate for cyp3a4 (13). in this study, we found that
ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir inhibited the growth of the du145
and pc-3 aipc cells as measured by the clonogenic assay. ritonavir
blocked the docetaxel-induced expression of cyp3a4 at the mrna
level in du145 cells and enhanced the antitumor effect of docetaxel
in vitro and in  xxxd300xxx  nude mice bearing du145 tumors.

materials and methods

treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer (aipc) remains unsatisfactory, even though new anticancer drugs have been
developed. one of the promising chemotherapeutic treatments for
individuals with aipc is docetaxel, which has anti–prostate cancer
effects in ⬃40% of individuals with aipc (1–3).
hiv-1 protease inhibitors (pis) have become important tools in the
management of hiv infection; these include  xxxd3168xxx , ritonavir, and  xxxd2346xxx . recent studies showed that pis possess antitumor activity, which is independent from their ability to inhibit hiv

evaluation of nf␬b activity by elisa. the dna binding activity of
nf␬b in prostate cancer cells was quantified by elisa using the trans-am nf␬b
p65 transcription factor assay kit (active motif north america, carlsbad, ca),
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. briefly, nuclear extracts were
prepared as described previously and incubated in 96-well plates coated with
immobilized oligonucleotide (5⬘-agttgaggggactttcccaggc-3⬘) containing a consensus (5⬘-gggactttcc-3⬘) binding site for the p65 subunit of
nf␬b. nf␬b binding to the target oligonucleotide was detected by incubation
with primary antibody specific for the activated form of p65 (active motif north
america), visualized by anti-igg horseradish peroxidase conjugate and developing
solution, and quantified at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm.
background binding was subtracted from the value obtained for binding to the
consensus dna sequence.

age were purchased from harlan sprague dawley inc. (indianapolis, nj) and
were maintained in pathogen-free conditions with irradiated chow.
treatment protocol. animals were bilaterally, subcutaneously injected with
2 ⫻ 106 du145 cells/tumor in 0.1 ml matrigel (collaborative biomedical
products, bedford, ma). mice were divided randomly into four groups of five
mice each: group a, control diluent (control); group b, ritonavir; group c,
docetaxel; and group d, docetaxel ⫹ ritonavir. ritonavir (10 mg/kg/mouse) was
administered five times a week orally. docetaxel (25 mg/kg/mouse) was administered intravenously once a week. the dose of ritonavir and docetaxel was
determined by our preliminary studies. tumors were measured every week with
vernier calipers. tumor size was calculated by the formula: a ⫻ b ⫻ c, where “a”
is the length and “b” is the width and “c” is the height in millimeters. at the end
of the experiment, animals were sacrificed by co2 asphyxiation, and tumor
weights were measured after their careful resection. blood also was collected from
the orbital sinus for chemistry and hematopoietic analysis.

pis (10⫺9 to 10⫺5 mol/l). dose-response curves were drawn, and the
ed50 that inhibited colony formation was determined. each of the
three pis—ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir—was effective at inhibiting clonal proliferation of the du145 and pc-3 cells in a dosedependent manner (fig. 1a and b). the most effective pi was ritonavir, which caused a 50% decrease clonal growth of du145 cells at
3 ⫻ 10⫺6 mol/l (fig. 1a). ritonavir and saquinavir showed nearly
equivalent potency against pc-3 cells with an ed50 of 8 ⫻ 10⫺6
mol/l (fig. 1b). conversely, none of pis inhibited growth of normal
myeloid committed stem cells (cfu-gm) in soft agar containing
cytokines including  xxxg1177xxx  and granulocyte macrophage-colony
stimulating factor even at a high concentration of pi (2 ⫻ 10⫺5 mol/l;
data not shown).
ritonavir enhances growth arrest and apoptosis mediated by
docetaxel. the du145 cells were cultured with docetaxel (10⫺10
mol/l) either alone or in combination with ritonavir (10⫺6 mol/l) to
evaluate the effect of the combinations of these drugs. docetaxel
(10⫺10 mol/l) inhibited the growth of du145 cells by 28 ⫾ 9%, and
ritonavir (10⫺6 mol/l) inhibited proliferation by 30 ⫾ 9%. the
combination of docetaxel (10⫺10 mol/l) and ritonavir (10⫺6 mol/l)
decreased the growth of du145 cells by 77 ⫾ 4% (fig. 2a).
further studies investigated whether ritonavir enhanced the proapoptotic effect of docetaxel in du145 cells using western blot
analysis to detect cleavage of parp, which is a target of caspases.
the cleavage of parp is thought to be a late event in apoptosis.
docetaxel (10⫺9 to 10⫺6 mol/l) cleaved parp because caspase-3
was activated in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 2b). ritonavir (10⫺5
mol/l) potentiated the effects of docetaxel to activate caspase-3 and
cleave its target molecule parp (fig. 2b). for example, the activated
form of caspase-3 and cleaved parp were negligible in du145 cells
treated with docetaxel (10⫺9 mol/l) alone; however, the combination
of docetaxel (10⫺9 mol/l) and ritonavir (10⫺5 mol/l) induced activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of parp in du145 cells.
effect of ritonavir on docetaxel-induced expression of
cyp3a4 transcripts. the level of cyp3a4 transcripts in du145
cells was measured using real-time pcr. du145 cells constitutively

expressed cyp3a4, and docetaxel (10⫺9 mol/l, 24 hours) increased
its expression by 2.5-fold (fig. 3). ritonavir (10⫺5 mol/l, 24 hours)
completely blocked this induction (fig. 3). these data suggested that
ritonavir inhibited the ability of docetaxel to induce expression of
cyp3a4 at the transcriptional level.
effect of ritonavir on dna binding activity of nf␬b in du145
cells. nf␬b stimulates cell proliferation and confers cellular resistance to chemotherapy (15–18). therefore, nf␬b can be a
molecular target of cancer treatment. the effect of ritonavir on
nf␬b activity was explored using an elisa-based assay. control
du145 cells possessed strong nf␬b/dna binding activity (data
not shown). treatment of du145 cells with ritonavir (1 or 2 ⫻
10⫺5 mol/l) inhibited the nf␬b binding activity by either
25 ⫾ 7% or 53 ⫾ 13%, respectively, as compared with untreated
control cells (fig. 4a). as control, 100-fold molar excess of the
wild-type nf␬b consensus oligonucleotides was added to the
assay of control lysate from untreated cells. binding was inhibited
by at least 80%; however, mutated nf␬b consensus oligonucleotides at the same molar excess were unable to inhibit binding
(fig. 4a), ascertaining the specificity of binding of nf␬b to its
consensus binding site.
inhibition of nf␬b by sirna augmented cytotoxicity of docetaxel. to explore whether inhibition of nf␬b sensitizes du145
cells to the antitumor effect of docetaxel, du145 cells were transiently transfected with either nf␬b sirna or control sirna. after
48 hours, cells were harvested and subjected to western blot analysis,
showing that nf␬b sirna effectively down-regulated levels of this
transcription factor (fig. 4b). transfectants were cultured either with
or without docetaxel for another 48 hours and subjected to mtt
assay. nf␬b sirna-transfected du145 cells were more sensitive to
growth inhibition mediated by docetaxel compared with nonspecific
sirna-transfected cells (fig. 4c). for example, 10⫺10 mol/l docetaxel inhibited growth of control cells by 20%; however, it inhibited
growth of nf␬b sirna-transfected cells by 34% (p ⬍ 0.005) under
similar culture conditions (fig. 4c).

ritonavir increased the antitumor activity of docetaxel in
vivo. we evaluated the ability of ritonavir to enhance the ability of
docetaxel to inhibit the growth of aipc du145 cells growing as
xenografts in male  xxxd300xxx  nu/nu triple immunodeficient mice. one day
after injection of du145 cells, mice were treated with ritonavir,
docetaxel, or both. control mice received diluent alone. tumor volume was measured every week (fig. 5a), and tumor weights were
determined at autopsy (fig. 5b). docetaxel markedly suppressed the
growth and weights of du145 tumors. no statistical significance was
noted in either the size or weights of the du145 tumors in the mice
that received ritonavir alone as compared with the control mice;
however, the combination of ritonavir and docetaxel significantly
decreased the size (p ⫽ 0.05) of du145 tumors compared with mice
that received docetaxel alone (fig. 5a). the difference of mean tumor
weights between these two groups was even more significant (fig. 5b;
p ⬍ 0.01). the tumors from mice that received docetaxel alone
weighed 72 ⫾ 41 mg. conversely, tumors from mice that received the
combination of docetaxel and ritonavir weighed only 27 ⫾ 5 mg
(fig. 5b).
the tumors and organs of the mice were fixed, stained, and viewed
by light microscopy. the tumors from control mice showed typical
histologic appearance of infiltrating, poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of the prostate (fig. 6a). the mice that received ritonavir
alone showed a similar histologic appearance as the control mice
(fig. 6b). the histologic analysis of the tumors from mice treated with
docetaxel alone showed necrotic tissue with ⬃40% of cancer cells
undergoing necrosis (fig. 6c). cancer cells were not found in the
mice that received the combination of docetaxel and ritonavir; the site
of tumor was composed of necrotic and fibrotic tissues (fig. 6d).
organs from mice treated with the various therapies did not show any
changes compared with controls, including their liver, kidney, spleen,
bone marrow, lung, and heart. during the study, all of the mice were
weighed each week; the mean weights of each of the experimental
groups were statistically the same as those of the control mice (data
not shown). blood analyses were performed several hours before the
mice were sacrificed. no difference in the mean hematopoietic values
and blood chemistries was observed between treated and untreated
mice (data not shown).
the ability of ritonavir to enhance antitumor effects of docetaxel
also was studied using established du145 xenografts (fig. 7). once
tumor volume reached approximately a mean of 200 mm3, treatment
was initiated. ritonavir again significantly enhanced the ability of
docetaxel to decrease tumor size (p ⫽ 0.01) and tumor weight
(p ⫽ 0.008) of du145 xenografts (fig. 7a and b). we measured
apoptosis of du145 tumor cells using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated nick end labeling (tunel) assay. tunelpositive cells were negligible in control and ritonavir-treated mice.
conversely, docetaxel induced ⬃8% of du145 cells to become
tunel positive. importantly, when docetaxel was combined with
ritonavir, tunel-positive cells increased to 16% (data not shown).
at the end of this experiment, we sacrificed the mice, removed their
tumors, extracted rna, and measured levels of cyp3a4 by real-time
pcr. at 16 hours before sacrifice, either docetaxel or ritonavir alone
or in combination was administered to the mice. as shown in fig. 7c,
docetaxel increased expression of cyp3a4 by approximately twofold
in du145 tumors; when docetaxel was combined with ritonavir,
docetaxel-induced expression of cyp3a4 was blocked completely.
we also extracted nuclear protein from tumors and explored the effect
of ritonavir on nf␬b dna binding activity (fig. 7d). control tumors
possessed measurable nf␬b dna binding activity (mean absorbance
at 450 mm, 0.73 ⫾ 0.15), and ritonavir inhibited this activity by 40%
(mean absorbance at 450 mm, 0.43 ⫾ 0.1). these results were
consistent with those obtained from the in vitro studies (figs. 3 and 4).

fig. 7. effect of ritonavir, docetaxel, or the combination of both against established
du145 xenografts. du145 cells were injected bilaterally subcutaneously into  xxxd300xxx  mice,
forming two tumors/mouse. when tumor volume reached ⬃200 mm3, mice were randomized into five groups (n ⫽ 5 each), and treatment was initiated with ritonavir (10

hiv-1 protease inhibitors and prostate cancer

discussion

references

the hiv-1 pi, ritonavir, blocked docetaxel-induced expression of
cyp3a4 in aipc du145 cells in vitro and in vivo. thus, ritonavir
probably protected docetaxel from inactivation in du145 cells, resulting in increased intracellular levels and enhanced antitumor effects. xenobiotics, including anticancer drugs such as docetaxel, bind
to  xxxg1598xxx . ligand-activated  xxxg1598xxx  forms heterodimer with retinoid x receptor and
binds to the promoter region of the cyp3a4 gene and activates its
transcription (19, 20). recent studies showed that coregulators, including silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptor and
 xxxg1510xxx , mediated basal and xenobiotic-induced
transcriptional activity of cyp3a4 (20). the investigators found that
the antifungal agent ketoconazole inhibited corticosterone-induced
cyp3a4 transcriptional activity by interacting with these coregulators
(20). ritonavir may block docetaxel-induced expression of cyp3a4
by also affecting these coregulators. further studies clearly will be
needed to elucidate molecular mechanism by which ritonavir inhibits
docetaxel-induced expression of cyp3a4.
p-gp is an integral plasma membrane protein encoded by the
multidrug-resistant (mdr) gene belonging to the atp-binding cassette family of transporters (21). it is an energy-dependent efflux
pump for a wide variety of compounds, including anticancer drugs
such as docetaxel (15). the cancer cells from individuals with advanced, refractory cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung, overexpress p-gp transcripts (22, 23). thus, overexpression of p-gp is
considered to contribute to drug resistance. ritonavir was shown to
inhibit the activity of p-gp; thus, ritonavir also might enhance the
activity of docetaxel by blocking its cellular efflux, although pis,
including ritonavir, also are substrate for p-gp (24, 25). we and other
investigators found that p-gp– overexpressing doxorubicin-resistant
breast cancer mcf-7 cells were resistant to docetaxel (data not
shown; ref. 26). our preliminary studies showed that ritonavir enhanced the ability of docetaxel to decrease the growth of these cells
(data not shown).
recent studies found that pis inhibited 26s proteasome activity.
ritonavir and saquinavir inhibited the degradation of i␬b␣, which
prevented the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of
nf␬b in kaposi sarcoma and prostate cancer cells (5, 7). this was
associated with growth arrest and apoptosis of these cells. cancer cells
including prostate cancer often have hyperactivity of the nf␬b pathway, which can make these malignant cells relatively resistant to
chemotherapy (16 –18). in this study, we have found that du145 cells
possessed strong nf␬b dna binding activity, and ritonavir decreased
this activity in vitro (fig. 4a) and in vivo (fig. 7d). this also may
contribute to the increased cytotoxicity of the combination of ritonavir
and docetaxel.
in summary, we suggest a novel approach to cancer therapy by
using an active chemotherapeutic drug and a pi (ritonavir) to help
reverse the mechanisms of drug resistance, including rapid drug
metabolism, efficient removal of the drug from the target cancer cells,
and down-regulation of the nf␬b pathway.
