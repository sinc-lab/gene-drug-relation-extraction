the ⌬4-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in nearly all steroid hormones apart from estrogens. the first step in functionalization of the a-ring is mediated in humans by steroid 5␣- or
5␤-reductase. finasteride is a mechanism-based inactivator of
5␣-reductase type 2 with subnanomolar affinity and is widely
used as a therapeutic for the treatment of benign prostatic
hyperplasia. it is also used for androgen deprivation in hormonedependent prostate carcinoma, and it has been examined as a
chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer. the effect of finasteride on steroid 5␤-reductase ( xxxg117xxx ) has not been previously reported. we show that finasteride competitively inhibits
 xxxg117xxx  with low micromolar affinity but does not act as
a mechanism-based inactivator. the structure of the
akr1d1䡠nadpⴙ䡠finasteride complex determined at 1.7 å resolution shows that it is not possible for nadph to reduce the
⌬1-2-ene of finasteride because the cofactor and steroid are not
proximal to each other. the c3-ketone of finasteride accepts
hydrogen bonds from the catalytic residues tyr-58 and glu-120
in the active site of  xxxg117xxx , providing an explanation for the
competitive inhibition observed. this is the first reported structure of finasteride bound to an enzyme involved in steroid hormone metabolism.

steroid 5␣-reductases ( xxxg2199xxx ,  xxxg2200xxx ) or steroid 5␤-reductase ( xxxg117xxx )3 to yield the corresponding 5␣- or 5␤-dihydrosteroids, respectively (1, 2). the products of these reactions are
not always inactive. 5␣-reductase is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to 5␣-dihydrotestosterone (5␣-dht),
which is the most potent natural ligand for the  xxxg183xxx . by contrast, in addition to being involved in bile acid biosynthesis, 5␤-reductase is responsible for generating 5␤-pregnanes, which are natural ligands for the pregnane-x receptor
( xxxg1598xxx ) in the liver (3, 4).  xxxg1598xxx  is involved in the induction of
cyp3a4, which is responsible for the metabolism of a large
proportion of drugs (5, 6). thus both 5␣-reductase and 5␤-reductase are involved in the formation of potent ligands for
nuclear receptors.
finasteride is a selective 5␣-reductase type 2 inhibitor that
reduces plasma 5␣-dihydrotestosterone levels and shrinks the
size of the prostate (7). it is a widely used therapeutic agent in
the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (8, 9), it is used in
androgen deprivation therapy to treat prostate cancer (10), and
it has been examined as a chemopreventive agent for hormonedependent prostate cancer (11). finasteride was originally
thought to act as a competitive inhibitor with nanomolar affinity for 5␣-reductase type 2 (12). more recently, it was found that
finasteride acts as a mechanism-based inactivator of this
enzyme (13). subsequent to inhibitor binding, there is hydride
transfer from the nadph cofactor to the ⌬1-2-ene double bond
of finasteride. the intermediate enolate tautomerizes at the
enzyme active site to form a bisubstrate analogue in which dihydrofinasteride is covalently bound to nadp⫹ (13). the bisubstrate analogue has subnanomolar affinity for 5␣-reductase
type 2 (fig. 1). no structural information exists for 5␣-reductase type 1 or type 2; therefore, it is not possible to determine
how finasteride would bind to the active site of a human steroid
double bond reductase in the absence of an experimentally
determined crystal structure.
human steroid 5␤-reductase is a member of the aldo-keto
reductase (akr) superfamily and is formally designated
( xxxg117xxx ) (14). the akrs are soluble nadp(h)-dependent
oxidoreductases with monomeric molecular masses of 37 kda.
these enzymes are amenable to x-ray crystallography, and during the last year, we and others have reported crystal structures
of ternary complexes of  xxxg117xxx  (15–17). the ternary
complexes containing steroid substrates include: akr1d1䡠
nadp⫹䡠testosterone (pdb: 3bur), akr1d1䡠nadp⫹䡠progesterone (pdb: 3cot), akr1d1䡠nadp⫹䡠cortisone (pdb:
3cmf), and akr1d1䡠nadp⫹䡠⌬ xxxd176xxx  (pdb:
3cas) (17). in addition, ternary complexes containing the products 5␤-dihydroprogesterone (pdb: 3cav) and 5␤-dihydrotestosterone (pdb: 3dop) have also been described (16, 18).
as part of an ongoing inhibitor screen of  xxxg117xxx , we now
report that finasteride acts as a competitive inhibitor with low

experimental procedures
materials—the pet16b and pet28a vectors were purchased from novagen. the escherichia coli strain  xxxd113xxx  (de3)
was provided by dr. j. e. walker (medical research council
laboratory of molecular biology, cambridge, uk). nadph
was obtained from roche applied science. steroids were purchased from steraloids, inc. [4-14c]testosterone (50 mci/
mmol) was obtained from perkinelmer life sciences. finasteride was obtained from merck research laboratories. all
other reagents were of american chemical society quality or
higher.
expression of recombinant  xxxg117xxx —previously we reported
the expression of  xxxg117xxx  using the prokaryotic expression vectors pet16b and pet28a (15). recombinant  xxxg117xxx  was purified to homogeneity as described previously (15). wild-type
 xxxg117xxx  was obtained in 56% yield and had a final specific activity
of 80 nmol of testosterone reduced per minute per mg of purified
enzyme under standard radiometric assay conditions.
standard radiometric assay and product verification—the
standard assay contained 2 ␮m [4-14c]testosterone (40,000
dpm), 8 ␮m unlabeled testosterone, 5% acetonitrile, and 100 mm
phosphate buffer (ph 6.0). reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 ␮m nadph and performed at 37 °c. the substrate
and product of the quenched reaction were separated by tlc
and quantitated by scintillation counting. the 5␤-dihydrotestosterone (5␤-dht) product was identified by co-chromatography with the authentic standard.
standard spectrofluorometric assay—spectrofluorometric
analysis of the reduction of testosterone to 5␤-dht was performed by monitoring the decrease in nadph emission on a
fluorescence spectrophotometer f-4500 (hitachi america,
ltd., new york, ny). assays contained 10 ␮m testosterone, 15
␮m nadph, 4% acetonitrile in 100 mm potassium phosphate
buffer (ph 6.0) in a final volume of 1 ml. reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored at 37 °c.
nadph emission was monitored by using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm (slit width 5 nm) and an emission wavelength
set at 460 nm (slit width 10 nm). a standard curve was performed daily to convert the arbitrary fluorescence units measured at 460 nm to nadph concentration. the curve was used
to calculate the amount of nadph oxidized per minute in the
assays. the specific activity observed was in agreement with the
specific activity measured radiometrically and gave a value of 80
nmol of testosterone reduced per minute per mg of purified
enzyme.

enzyme inhibition studies—enzyme inhibition studies
were performed using the standard radiometric assay to
monitor the reduction of 2.0 ␮m [14c]testosterone in the
absence or presence of increasing finasteride concentrations
at 37 °c. the ki value was determined by producing a family
of lines using different fixed substrate concentrations and by
varying the finasteride concentration. the family of lines was
fit using grafit, and the pattern was examined to determine
the mode of inhibition, i.e. competitive, noncompetitive, and
uncompetitive. time-dependent incubation studies were
performed with finasteride in which  xxxg117xxx  (7.8 ␮m) was
preincubated with finasteride (31.0 ␮m) in the presence and
absence of nadph (144 ␮m) in 100 mm buffer (ph 6.0) at
37 °c. aliquots were removed from the incubation over time
and directly diluted (100-fold dilution) into the standard
spectrofluorometric assay, and the amount of enzyme activity remaining was determined.
crystallography—the akr1d1䡠nadp⫹䡠finasteride complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method at 4 °c. typically, a drop containing 3.0 ␮l of enzyme
solution (5.0 mg/ml  xxxg117xxx , 2.0 mm nadp⫹, 0.5 mm finasteride, 10.0 mm tris (ph 7.4)) and 4.0 ␮l of precipitant buffer
(0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7.0), 10 –20% (w/v)  xxxd2982xxx 
4000, 10%  xxxd2400xxx ) was equilibrated against a 1-ml
reservoir of precipitant buffer. crystals of the akr1d1䡠
nadp⫹䡠finasteride complex appeared within 1 week and were
then soaked for 24 h in the same mother liquor solution augmented with 2.0 mm nadp⫹, 2.0 mm finasteride, and 30%  xxxd2400xxx . following transfer to a 32% jeffamine solution
and flash-cooling, these crystals yielded diffraction data to 1.70
å resolution at the national synchrotron light source (beamline x6a, ␭ ⫽ 1.00 å, 100 k). diffraction intensities measured
from these crystals indicated that they belonged to the space
group p212121 with unit cell parameters similar to those previously measured from crystals of  xxxg117xxx  complexed with different steroids (15). two monomers occupy the asymmetric
unit in this crystal form. data reduction was achieved using the
programs hkl2000 and scalepack (19). data collection and
reduction statistics are reported in table 1.
the structure of the akr1d1䡠nadp⫹䡠finasteride complex
was solved by the difference fourier method using the model of
the akr1d1䡠nadp⫹䡠cortisone complex less ligand atoms and
water molecules (pdb: 3cmf) as a starting model. the programs cns (20) and phenix.refine (21) were used to refine the
model, and the graphics program coot (22) was used for map
fitting. in the final stage of refinement, the atomic coordinates
of finasteride were retrieved from entry wolxea (23) in the

results
inhibition studies—finasteride, which is a mechanism-based
inhibitor of 5␣-reductase with subnanomolar affinity, is a competitive inhibitor of recombinant  xxxg117xxx  with a ki value of 2.1
␮m when  xxxg117xxx  is saturated with nadph and testosterone
is used as a varied substrate (fig. 2). knowing that finasteride is
a mechanism-based inactivator of 5␣-reductase type 2 and that
the mechanism of inactivation has an obligatory requirement
for nadph, we conducted preincubation studies of  xxxg117xxx 
with finasteride in the presence and absence of added nadph
over 140 min. upon dilution of aliquots into a standard
 xxxg117xxx  activity assay, we obtained no evidence for time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme.

figure 2. competitive inhibition of  xxxg117xxx  by finasteride. lineweaverburk plots demonstrate that finasteride (0 –20 ␮m) exhibits a competitive inhibition pattern for the reduction of testosterone catalyzed by  xxxg117xxx . assays
were performed as described under “experimental procedures.”

the structure of this complex is very similar to the crystal structures of the ternary  xxxg117xxx  complexes containing nadp⫹
and either cortisone or progesterone, with root mean square
deviations of ⬃0.20 å for 324 c␣ atoms (15). the electron
density envelope of finasteride is clear and unambiguous (fig.
3a), showing that the steroid binds perpendicular to the
nadp⫹ cofactor.
the side chain of trp-230 plays a key role in packing against
the ␤-face of finasteride, which is oriented toward the re-face of
the nicotinamide ring of nadp⫹ such that the steroid c1–c2
double bond is too far away from the 4-pro-r-hydride of
nadph for double bond reduction to occur (fig. 3a). the c3
carbonyl oxygen of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from
the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyr-58 and the anti-oriented
conformer of the carboxylic acid side chain of glu-120. additionally, the n4 group and the c20 carbonyl oxygen group of
finasteride engage in hydrogen-bond interactions with water
molecules (fig. 3a). interestingly, although the binding mode of
finasteride is similar to that of progesterone, finasteride is
rotated by ⬃12° with respect to progesterone (fig. 3b), and the
segment arg-226 –val-231 (which contains trp-230) in loop b
moves ⬃1 å away to accommodate finasteride binding in comparison with progesterone binding.
in monomer a, continuous but uninterpretable electron
density is observed, possibly indicating disordered or low occupancy binding of finasteride (supplemental fig. s1). accordingly, we have not built finasteride into this density in the final
model. finally, in both monomers, the backbone conformation
of thr-224 adopts a disallowed conformation on the ramachandran plot. notably, the electron density corresponding to
thr-224 is clear and continuous (data not shown). because
thr-224 is adjacent to the substrate and cofactor binding sites
(15), it is possible that its unfavorable backbone conformation is
accommodated to optimize enzyme function. herzberg and
moult (25) observe that regions of such steric strain in refined
enzyme structures are located overwhelmingly in or near active

discussion
 xxxg117xxx  is inhibited by the 5␣-reductase type 2 selective
inhibitor finasteride by acting solely as a reversible competitive inhibitor. the ki value of 2.1 ␮m is considerably higher
than that observed for either the competitive inhibition or
time-dependent inactivation of 5␣-reductase type 2. by contrast, the ki value of 2.1 ␮m is less than an order of magnitude
greater than that observed for the inhibition of 5␣-reductase
type 1 (ki value of 300 nm) (26). both  xxxg117xxx  and 5␣-reductase type 1 play important roles in the hepatic clearance of steroid hormones, suggesting that high dose finasteride may have
an adverse effect on hepatic steroid metabolism. inhibition of
 xxxg117xxx  by high dose finasteride would also deprive  xxxg1598xxx  of its
