abstract
to study if cabergoline, a long-lasting specific dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist, has neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress, we
exposed (3 h) sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells to tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-booh; 500 am). t-booh caused a 42 f 4% neuronal
death, which was prevented by cabergoline (2 h before) in a concentration-dependent manner (ec50: 1.24 am). this effect was not
antagonised by haloperidol (concentration up to 10 am), and was associated with an increased availability of intracellular gsh contents
( + 30 f 11%) and a decrease in the membrane lipid peroxidation ( 23 f 9%). our data suggest that cabergoline has neuroprotective effects
useful for parkinson’s disease therapy.

1. introduction
despite the progress in the understanding of the pathogenesis of parkinson’s disease (mouradian, 2002), there has
been little progress in the pharmacotherapy of this disease
and levodopa, although potentially neurotoxic, continues to
be the most effective symptomatic drug. recently, dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  agonists (i.e., bromocriptine, pergolide,  xxxd3145xxx , pramipexole and cabergoline) have been introduced into
clinical practice for improving symptoms and preventing the
development of levodopa-induced neurotoxic effects (jankovic, 2001).
most oral dopamine receptor agonists currently in use
have relatively short durations of action and appear not to
provide the continuous dopaminergic stimulation necessary
for clinical efficacy of the therapy (mouradian, 2002).
several drugs that could achieve this goal have been
studied, and among them cabergoline may provide reasonably steady dopaminergic stimulation.
cabergoline is an ergoline derivative with potent, selective, long-lasting agonist action at dopamine d2 receptors
(fariello, 1998). administration of cabergoline reverses

catalepsy in reserpine-treated rats (miyagi et al., 1996),
and improves the symptoms in animal models of parkinson’s disease (nomoto et al., 1998). in healthy humans or
hyperprolactinemic patients, oral cabergoline has a potent
prolactin-lowering effect, lasting 4 – 7 days (di sarno et al.,
2001). cabergoline has a long plasma half-life (63 – 68 h in
healthy volunteers), longer than that of pergolide, bromocriptine, and  xxxd2498xxx , and it is effective in parkinson’s disease
therapy, either as monotherapy or combined with levodopa
(baas and schueler, 2001).
neuroprotection against oxidative stress is an important
factor in the treatment of parkinson’s disease, since free
radical-induced damage is one of the major possible mechanisms of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration
(lipton and rosenberg, 1994). some of the new dopamine
receptor agonists have been shown to possess also neuroprotective properties (gassen and youdim, 1999), and we
tested if cabergoline can prevent necrotic neuronal death in
an in vitro model of oxidative stress.
for this purpose, sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells,
differentiated into neuron-like type by treatment with  xxxd3417xxx , were exposed to tert-butylhydroperoxide (tbooh), a membrane-permeant oxidant (amoroso et al.,
1999). our data demonstrate that cabergoline protects shsy5y cells from t-booh-induced oxidative stress by a

non-receptor-mediated mechanism, probably linked to both
an increased availability of intracellular thiol compounds,
and a decrease of membrane lipid peroxidation.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
sh-sy5y cells were cultured in 1:1 ham’s f-12:dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (dmem), supplemented
with 10% foetal calf serum (gibco brl, usa) and
antibiotics, at 37 jc in 5% co2.
for differentiation,  xxxd3417xxx  (10 am) was added to
the cell culture (60 – 70% cellular confluence/dish) medium
(changed every day) for 1 week.
2.2. drug treatment
for oxidative stress experiments, the cells were exposed
(3 h at 37 jc) to 500 am t-booh. drugs were added to
experimental buffer (in mm: nacl 138, kcl 2.7, cacl2 1.2,
mgcl2 1.2, phosphate buffered saline (pbs) 10, glucose 10;
ph 7.4): cabergoline (pharmacia italia s.p.a., italy), haloperidol, bromocriptine and apomorphine 2 h before tbooh,  xxxd3521xxx  ( xxxd3521xxx ) 1 h before. drugs were
from sigma chemical co. (usa); all other reagents were
from merck (germany).
2.3. cell viability
cell survival was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo1-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay
(mosmann, 1983) and by fluorescein diacetate- xxxd3027xxx 
iodide staining (jones and senft, 1985) at the end of the
oxidative insult.
2.4. evaluation of intracellular gsh
intracellular gsh content was measured on protein-free
extracts according to griffith (1980). gsh contents in each
sample were quantified from a standard curve obtained with
known amounts of gsh.
2.5. evaluation of lipid peroxidation
lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring the
thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances in cells, according
to the method described by ohkawa et al. (1979).

3. results
3.1. neuroprotective effects of cabergoline against oxidative
stress
t-booh induces a rapid, progressive and dose-dependent increase of free radical production in the differentiated
sh-sy5y cells (amoroso et al., 1999). as established in
previous experiments, 3-h exposure to 500 am t-booh in
experimental buffer at 37 jc significantly ( p < 0.01)
induced the death of 42 f 4% of neurons (mtt assay) (data
not shown). during t-booh exposure, cell morphology
was continuously observed by phase-contrast microscopy
and progressive necrosis of the cell body and of neurites was
evident.
cell pretreatment (2 h before t-booh) with increasing
concentrations (0.1 –100 am) of cabergoline was able to
significantly ( p < 0.01) prevent neuronal death. the maximum neuroprotection (56 f 8% of cell survival, in comparison to cabergoline-untreated cells) was achieved  xxxd1891xxx  am
cabergoline; the ec50 calculated was 1.24 am. this effect
was not abolished by cell pre-incubation (2 h) with haloperidol (concentration up to 10 am), a specific dopamine d2
receptor antagonist, suggesting a non-receptor-mediated
mechanism. in this case, the ec50 calculated was 1.20 am.
t-booh-induced neuronal death was also prevented by
cell pre-treatment (2 h before t-booh) with bromocriptine,
another dopaminomimetic ergot derivative, although with a
lower potency and efficacy than by cabergoline. the maximum effect calculated for this molecule was 35 f 8% of
cell survival  xxxd1891xxx  am, in comparison with a drug-untreated
sample. the ec50 was 2.03 am. apomorphine (0.1 – 30
am) did not have protective effects and was toxic at
concentrations up to 30 am in our experimental model.
when cells were pre-incubated (1 h before t-booh) with
increasing concentrations (0.1 – 100 am) of  xxxd3521xxx , a
lipid-soluble radical scavenger (van acker et al., 1993), we
measured a high degree of neuroprotection (76 f 10% cell
survival, in comparison with drug-untreated cells). the
ec50 calculated was 5.77 am (fig. 1a).
the cabergoline-induced neuroprotection was also confirmed by intravital fluorescein diacetate- xxxd3027xxx  iodide
staining. with this method the shape and the number of
green staining vital cells, and of red bright staining dead
cells, were examined by fluorescence microscopy. at the
end of 3-h incubation with t-booh (500 am), the number
of dead neurons was 35 f 7%, in vehicle-treated, 14 f 3%
in cabergoline (10 am)-treated, and 12 f 5% in  xxxd3521xxx 
(50 am)-treated cells, if compared with control cells not
exposed to t-booh (fig. 1b).

2.6. statistical analysis
results are expressed as means f s.e.m. of n experiments. statistical significance was evaluated by student’s ttest for paired values. differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

acid reacting substances levels

sy5y cells, we measured gsh and thiobarbituric acid
reacting substances levels. t-booh (500 am; 3 h) induced
a significant ( p < 0.01) decrease ( 54 f 11%) in the intracellular gsh levels, and a significant ( p < 0.01) increase
( + 326 f 35%) in the cellular thiobarbituric acid reacting
substances contents if compared to those in vehicle-treated
cells. pre-treatment of cells with cabergoline (10 am; 2 h) or

cabergoline (2 h before t-booh) or  xxxd3521xxx  (1 h before t-booh) were
kept in the buffer until the end of the experiment. intracellular gsh content
and thiobarbituric acid reacting substances in vehicle-treated cells were

4. discussion

fig. 1. neuroprotective effects of dopamine receptor agonists on t-boohinduced oxidative stress. (a) cabergoline (0.1 – 100 am), haloperidol (10
am), bromocriptine (0.1 – 30 am) and apomorphine (0.1 – 30 am) were
added 2 h before t-booh (500 am, 3 h),  xxxd3521xxx  (0.1 – 100 am) 1 h
before. the values represent the percentage inhibition of cell death (mtt
assay, performed at the end of oxidative insult) over drug-untreated cells.
the ec50s calculated were: 1.24 am for cabergoline, 1.20 am for
cabergoline + haloperidol, 2.03 am for bromocriptine, and 5.77 am for
 xxxd3521xxx . (b) cabergoline (0.1 – 10 am) or  xxxd3521xxx  (50 am) was added 2
or 1 h before t-booh, respectively. viable neurones were counted (four
separate field-dish) by fluorescein diacetate- xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining and
are expressed as percentage of control cells not exposed to t-booh cells.
the data represent the means f s.e.m. of at least six experiments run in
triplicate. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 vs. t-booh-treated cells.

oxidative stress has been implicated in the progressive
neuronal damage characteristic of parkinson’s disease, alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (lipton
and rosenberg, 1994). we selected as in vitro model of
oxidative stress the exposure of cells to the membranepermeant oxidant t-booh. in this model cell injury can
only be attributed to the overproduction of free radicals, and
therefore it represents a simple tool for studying new
antioxidant compounds (i.e., cabergoline). sh-sy5y cells
were employed for our experiments, because these cells are
sensitive to oxidative stress and express dopamine d2
receptors (amoroso et al., 1999).
in our experimental model, cabergoline was the most
potent dopamine receptor agonist able to prevent oxidativeinduced neuronal death. the affinity of cabergoline for
dopamine d2 receptors is higher than of both bromocriptine
and apomorphine (miyagi et al., 1996), and we might
speculate that selective  xxxg656xxx  stimulation is necessary
to induce intracellular event responsible for neuroprotection.
however, the lack of antagonism by haloperidol, the prototypic  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, rules out the hypothesis that
cabergoline prevents neuronal death by a dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism. in addition, apomorphine (0.1 – 30
am), a non-selective dopamine receptor agonist, was ineffective in our model. other authors reported different results
in the same cell line by using h2o2 as oxidative agent
(uberti et al., 2002). it is possible that the type of oxidative
pulse is important for the neuroprotective effect of apomorphine, or that the cells respond differently to apomorphine,
when incubated into the buffer solution, as we did, or in the
culture medium, as did the other authors.

from our results we may conclude that in vivo efficacy
(baas and schueler, 2001) of cabergoline is due not only to
its dopaminomimetic actions, but also to its ability to reduce
both the oxidant damages (lipid peroxidation), and the
intracellular gsh depletion. data from the literature have
also demonstrated that cabergoline is able to reduce basal
lipid peroxide levels in vivo (finotti et al., 2000), directly
scavenges free radicals and activates gsh system in vitro
and in vivo (yoshioka et al., 2002). therefore, overall the
data suggest that cabergoline acts as radical scavenger and
increases cellular responses against environmental stress
conditions.
in conclusion, cabergoline is effective as anti-oxidant
drug and prevents necrotic cell death. in our opinion, it may
represent a favourable drug not only for parkinson’s disease
therapy, but also for that of other neuropathological states
related to accumulation of free radicals.
