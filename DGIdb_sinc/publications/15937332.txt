the abbreviations used are: p4, progesterone; ar, androgen recep-

differentiation, implantation, ovulation, and mammary gland
development (1–3). progesterone exerts its physiological roles
primarily through the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), a member of
the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors (4, 5).
the pr consists of two isoforms, pr-a and pr-b, which are
derived from a single gene through alternative usage of promoters and translation initiation sites (6, 7). divergent as well
as overlapping functions of the two pr isoforms have been
identified both in vitro and in vivo (2, 8 –14).
the molecular mechanism of pr actions has been extensively
studied in the last decade. it is now generally accepted that
binding of p4 causes the pr to undergo conformational
changes, phosphorylation, dimerization, and interaction with
its target genes (15–19). the conformational change induced by
p4 binding also facilitates the interactions between the pr,
coregulators, and basal transcriptional factors, eventually
leading to altered gene expression (19, 20). it is hypothesized
that pr conformational changes conferred by different pr ligands will lead to various biological responses. in addition to
its genomic action, pr has been shown to elicit biological effects
through other signaling pathways. it has been demonstrated
that pr can interact with the src/ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to modulate cellular activities in a liganddependent manner (21–23). furthermore, ligand-independent
pr actions involving other signaling cascades have been shown
in vitro and in vivo (24 –28). recently, g protein-coupled membrane progesterone receptors have been identified (29, 30).
furthermore, p4 and/or steroidal progestin metabolites have
been shown to interact with a variety of non-pr pathways such
as the ␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a receptor (31–33). therefore,
pr ligands have the potential to elicit a wide variety of biological and pharmacological responses.
pr agonists, i.e. progestins, have many therapeutic uses in
women’s health, such as in oral contraception and hormone
therapies and for the treatment of certain reproductive disorders. in the past few decades many progestins have been developed. most of them and all of those in clinical usage are
steroidal compounds. even though these compounds are effective in achieving their intended efficacy endpoints, such as

 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) agonists have several important applications in women’s health, such as in oral
contraception and post-menopausal hormone therapy.
currently, all pr agonists used clinically are steroids.
because of their interactions with other steroid receptors, steroid-metabolizing enzymes, or other steroid-signaling pathways, these drugs can pose significant side
effects in some women. efforts to discover novel nonsteroidal pr agonists with improved biological properties
led to the discovery of  xxxd3286xxx  (tnpr). tnpr binds
to the pr from various species with a higher relative
affinity than reference steroidal progestins. in t47d
cells, tnpr induces alkaline phosphatase activity with
an ec50 value of 0.1 nm, comparable with potent steroidal progestins such as  xxxd2554xxx 
(mpa) and trimegestone (tmg), albeit with a reduced
efficacy (⬃60%). in a mammalian two-hybrid assay to
measure pr agonist-induced interaction between steroid receptor co-activator-1 and pr, tnpr showed similar potency (ec50 value of 0.02 nm) and efficacy to mpa
and tmg. importantly, in key animal models such as the
rat ovulation inhibition assay, tnpr demonstrates full
efficacy and an enhanced progestational potency (30fold) when compared with mpa and tmg. furthermore,
tnpr has relatively weak interactions with other steroid receptors and binding proteins and little effect on
cytochrome p450 metabolic pathways. finally, the
three-dimensional crystal structure of the pr ligand
binding domain with tnpr has been delineated to demonstrate how this nonsteroidal ligand achieves its high
binding affinity. therefore, tnpr is a structurally novel
and very selective pr agonist with an improved preclinical pharmacological profile.

cell culture and in vitro assays—the human breast carcinoma cell
lines t47d and mcf-7, the human lung carcinoma cell line a549, the
mouse skin fibroblast cell line l929, and the monkey kidney cell line
cos7 were obtained from american type culture collection (manassas,
va). t47d and mcf-7 cells were maintained in dmem/f12, a549 cells in
def/npm, l929, and cos7 cells in dmem, all with 10% fbs. cells were
passed 2–3 times every week.
t47d alkaline phosphatase assay—the effect of tnpr and reference steroids on alkaline phosphatase activity in t47d cells was determined as described (34, 35). briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates
at 50,000 cells/well in dmem/f12 with 10% fbs. after overnight
culture, the medium was changed to phenol red-free dmem/f12 containing 2% charcoal-stripped fbs (experimental medium). the next
day, cells were treated with a test compound in the absence (agonist
mode) or presence (antagonist mode) of 1 nm progesterone in the experimental medium. twenty-four hours after treatment, cellular alkaline
phosphatase activity was measured using  xxxd2822xxx  as a
substrate. optical density measurements were taken at 5-min intervals
for 30 min at a test wavelength of 405 nm.
pr binding assay—uterine tissues from the rat, monkey, and rabbit
were homogenized in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (1.5 nm edta, ph 7.4) with 20
mm  xxxd3216xxx  and 1 mm dithiothreitol, whereas t47d cells
were homogenized in 20 mm hepes buffer (1 mm edta, ph 7.6) with
protease inhibitors (0.5 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 0.5 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 0.7 ␮g/ml
pepstatin a, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). after centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g for 1 h (4 °c), the supernatant containing pr
was collected and measured for protein concentration. the pr competition binding assay was done with 100 ␮g of cytosolic protein, 3 nm
[3h]r5020, and increasing concentrations of test compounds. following

overnight incubation at 4 °c, free [3h]r5020 and bound [3h]r5020 were
separated by using 0.5% charcoal and 0.05% dextran (molecular weight
69,000) in tris-edta buffer (ph 7.4). total [3h]r5020 and bound
[3h]r5020 were counted in a beckman ls6500 scintillation counter
(beckman instruments, inc.).
protease digestion assay—the protease digestion analysis was performed essentially as described (15, 37) with minor modifications. the
plasmid pt7bprb, kindly provided by dr. b. w. o’malley (baylor
college of medicine, houston, tx), was used to generate 35s-radiolabeled pr-b using a tnt t7 quick coupled transcription/translation
system according to the manufacturer’s protocol (promega, madison,
wi). after the translation reaction, an aliquot (30 ␮l) of the lysate was
incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of ligands at a final
concentration of 100 nm. aliquots (5 ␮l) of the ligand-treated receptor
mixture were then incubated with a trypsin solution (worthington
biochemicals) giving various final concentrations of the enzyme (0, 25,
50, and 75 ␮g/ml). after incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the
digestion reaction was terminated with the addition of 20 ␮l of geldenaturing buffer and boiling for 5 min. the digestion products were
separated on a 4 –12% bis-tris nupage gel (bio-rad). after electrophoresis, the gel was treated with a 50% (v/v) methanol and 10% acetic
acid (v/v) solution for 30 min and immersed in amplify (amersham
biosciences) for 30 min. the gel was then dried under vacuum, and the
radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography.
pr/ xxxg1510xxx  mammalian two-hybrid assay—cos7 cells were transfected with pr-lbd in the gal4 dna binding domain plasmid pm
(clontech), full-length  xxxg1510xxx  or  xxxg1512xxx  in the vp16 activation domain
plasmid pvp16 (clontech), and a gal4-responsive luciferase reporter
(5⫻ galuas) using lipofectamine 2,000 (invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. cells were treated with test compounds
for 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured on a victor2 luminometer
(perkinelmer life sciences) using a luciferase reporter assay kit
(promega).
adenovirous hormone response element-luciferase reporter assays—luciferase reporter assays using cell lines expressing endogenous steroid receptors (mcf-7 cells for the  xxxg730xxx  (er), a549
cells for the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), and l929 cells for the  xxxg183xxx  (ar)) were used as described previously (34) to examine
potential cross-interactions between tnpr and these steroid receptors.
shbg competition binding assay—an shbg competition binding
assay was run based upon published methods (38, 39) with modifications. briefly, human blood was collected in vacutainer sst tubes (bd
biosciences) and kept at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation at 1,000 ⫻ g for 10 min (4 °c). the serum was aliquoted and
stored at ⫺76 °c. human serum was diluted 20 – 60 times with tg
buffer (10 mm tris and 10% glycerol, ph 7.4, at room temperature),
depending on the source of the serum, for a total [3h]dihydrotestosterone ([3h]dht) binding of ⬃3,000 cpm. seven hundred ␮l of dextrancoated charcoal (0.5% charcoal and 0.05% dextran (molecular weight
69,000) in tris-edta buffer, ph 7.4) was added to every 1,000 ␮l of
diluted serum and incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at
2,000 ⫻ g for 20 min. the shbg competition binding assay was performed with 100 ␮l of the supernatant, 8 nm [3h]dht, and increasing
concentrations of test compounds. following overnight incubation at
4 °c, free [3h]dht and bound [3h]dht were separated by using 0.5%
dextran-coated charcoal. bound [3h]dht was counted in a beckman
ls6500 scintillation counter (beckman instruments, inc.).
 xxxg590xxx  induction assay in dpx2 cells—the induction
potential of the cyp3a4 enzyme by tnpr was evaluated in a dpx2 cell
line by puracyp, inc. (carlsbad, ca). the dpx2 cell line is a stably
transformed tumor cell line. the enhancer of cyp3a4 (pxre) and
human  xxxg1598xxx  are stably integrated into the tumor cells. the incubations
were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a high throughput manner. tnpr and 3-kdg were incubated at 1, 5, 10, and 25 ␮m concentrations in dpx2 cell line. rifampicin, a known inducer of cyp3a4, was
used as positive control. induction of cyp3a4 was assessed by monitoring reporter gene activity and comparing the results to analogous
cells treated with solvent.
rat ovulation inhibition model—all animal studies were conducted
under approved wyeth research animal care and use committee
protocols. animals were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and
fed casein-based purina laboratory rodent diet 5k96 and water ad
libitum unless otherwise indicated.
ovulation inhibition experiments were run as described (40). briefly,
random cycling mature female sprague-dawley rats (⬃200 g) were
obtained from charles river laboratory (boston, ma). rats were synchronized for estrus with 2 ␮g of  xxxd2226xxx  (in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum al-

inhibition of ovulation in contraception and suppression of
estrogen-induced uterine epithelial proliferation in hormone
therapy, they also carry unwanted side effects due to interactions with other closely related steroid receptors, steroid-metabolizing enzymes, or other signaling pathways. as a first step
to circumvent some of these drawbacks, we set out to identify
novel nonsteroidal structures of pr ligands that would maintain the required biological activity while reducing the side
effects often associated with steroidal progestins. in this report
we describe the biological and molecular characterization of a
novel pr agonist,  xxxd3286xxx  (tnpr; fig. 1), which demonstrates improved pharmacological properties as compared with
those of traditional steroidal progestins. we also have delineated the first crystallographic structure of a pr ligand binding
domain (pr-lbd) with a nonsteroidal ligand.

bumin) administered subcutaneously per rat at 0900 h and again at
1600 h. animals were allowed to rest for 8 days before the administration of test compounds. animals were then grouped, with 8 –9 rats per
treatment group. the morning of the 9th day following luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone treatment the rats were treated with test
compounds once daily, by gavage, for 4 consecutive days. the animals
were euthanized the morning following the last treatment. oviducts
were removed, placed between two glass slides, and viewed through a
dissecting microscope to count ova. the number of animals presenting
ova in the oviduct from each treatment group and the number of ova in
the oviduct of each animal were recorded.

results

pr activity of tnpr in t47d cells—the in vitro pr activity
of tnpr was evaluated in the t47d alkaline phosphatase
assay. the compound was tested along with reference steroidal
progestins mpa and tmg. as shown in fig. 2, tnpr showed
potent pr agonist activity with an ec50 value of 0.15 ⫾ 0.01 nm
(n ⫽ 3), similar to mpa (ec50 ⫽ 0.12 ⫾ 0.01 nm, n ⫽ 3) and
tmg (0.09 ⫾ 0.02 nm, n ⫽ 3). tnpr had a reduced efficacy
(⬃60%) as compared with the steroid compounds in this assay.
however, as shown later, tnpr is fully efficacious in the rat
ovulation inhibition model.
tnpr promotes pr and  xxxg1510xxx  interaction in mammalian
cells—in a mammalian two-hybrid assay to determine the
interaction between  xxxg1510xxx  and pr induced by pr agonists,
tnpr showed similar potency and efficacy to mpa, tmg, and
lng and was ⬃50-fold more potent than p4 (fig. 3). similar
results were obtained when  xxxg1512xxx  was used in the two-hybrid
assay (data not shown).
tnpr binds to pr with high affinity—in the competition
binding assay, tnpr displaced r5020 (a synthetic steroidal
progestin) binding to the human pr with high relative affinity.
the ic50 values (50% inhibition of 3 nm [3h]r5020 binding to
the human pr) for tnpr were 1.7 compared with 11.2 and 7.8
nm for mpa and tmg, respectively (fig. 4). tnpr also showed
a 6 –30-fold higher affinity to the monkey, rat, and rabbit pr
than mpa and tmg (table ii).
other steroid receptor activity of tnpr in vitro—tnpr
was tested for potential effects via the er, ar, and gr using
hormone response element reporter assays in mcf-7, l929,
and a549 cells, respectively (34). tnpr did not exhibit any
agonist activity for these receptors when tested up to 10 ␮m and
showed relatively weak gr antagonist activity with an ic50
value of 40 nm. the reference gr antagonist ru-486 had an
ic50 value of ⬃1 nm in this assay. tnpr also showed modest
er antagonist activity with an ic50 value of ⬎1,000 nm. thus,
the in vitro selectivity of tnpr was ⬎250-fold for the pr over
the other steroid receptors tested. furthermore, tnpr did not
show any gr antagonist activity  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg in the rat (data
not shown).
tnpr does not compete for shbg binding—an shbg
competition binding assay was used to determine whether
tnpr competes with [3h]dht for shbg binding. whereas
unlabeled dht, lng, and  xxxd2751xxx  competitively inhibited [3h]dht binding with ic50 values of 1.3, 15.2, and 72 nm

gene construct for expression of the pr-lbd—pr-lbd was expressed in e. coli from a plasmid carrying the lbd coding sequence
(residues 675–933, gs . . . kk) as a fusion protein with glutathione
s-transferase (gst). a thrombin cleavage site separates the gst and
lbd regions. the construct is essentially the same as that described by
williams and sigler (41).
cell growth and induction of expression for pr-lbd—growth and
expression were performed in a b. braun biotech biostat c 10-liter
fermenter. a 100-ml preculture was used to inoculate 10 liters of fermenter salts, glucose, ampicillin, trace metals, and yeast extract media.
cells were grown overnight at 25 °c. fifteen minutes prior to induction,
the vessel temperature was dropped to 15 °c, and 5 ml of 66 mm p4 was
added. cells were induced with 2.4 g of isopropyl 1-thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside (1.0 mm final concentration) at an a600 value of 5.4. five ml of
66 mm p4 was added at induction and every 15 min after induction
throughout the entire expression (4 h total; 660 ␮m final concentration
of p4). after 4 h of induction, a final a600 value of 8 had been obtained.
the expression yielded ⬃160 g of wet cell weight, and the protein of
interest was approximated at 5–7% of total cell protein by sds-page.
purification of pr-lbd (complexed with tnpr) cell lysis and isolation of soluble protein—twenty grams of frozen cells were suspended
in 300 ml of 50 mm hepes (ph 7.3), 150 mm nacl, 5 mm edta, 10%
glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol with 0.33 mm  xxxd502xxx  (a protease inhibitor), 0.3 ml of protease inhibitor
mixture (sigma catalog number 8849), and 5 ␮m p4. p4 or tnpr was
added to solutions from stocks of 50 mm  xxxd1896xxx . cells were
broken by passage through a microfluidizertm from microfluidics (newton, ma). cell debris and aggregated gst䡠pr-lbd were removed by
centrifugation (sorvall rc5b centrifuge, ss34 rotor) at 5 °c for 2.5 h at
18,500 rpm (40,000 relative centrifugal force), chaps was added to
1.5%, and the solution was filtered (0.45-␮m cellulose nitrate filter) and
stored overnight.
isolation of gst䡠pr-lbd—the solution was passed over two 5-ml
columns (in tandem) of gstrap ff at ⬃1 ml/min. resin was washed
with 50 ml of 50 mm hepes (ph 7.3), 150 mm nacl, 5 mm edta, and
10% glycerol and then with 50 ml of the same solution containing 50 ␮m
tnpr. gst䡠pr-lbd was eluted with 12 mm  xxxd2213xxx  in 50
mm hepes (ph 7.3), 100 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% octyl-␤-glucoside, and 50 ␮m tnpr. fractions of 5 ml were collected and pooled after
location of the gst䡠pr-lbd by sds-page (generally a pool of 30 – 40
ml). thrombin was added to 25,000 nih units/ml, and the solution was
stored overnight.
isolation of pr-lbd—the solution was diluted with 4 volumes of 10
mm hepes (ph 7.3), 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% octyl-␤glucoside, and 50 ␮m tnpr. the solution was passed over 1-ml column
of sp ff at 1 ml/min. the column was washed with 5 ml of 10 mm
hepes (ph 7.3), 20 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% octyl-␤-glucoside, and
1 ␮m tnpr. pr-lbd was eluted from the column with a 15-ml gradient
of  xxxd3213xxx  running from 20 to 220 mm (other components are
described directly above). fractions of 1 ml were collected and pr-lbd
was located by sds-page, and those fractions containing pr-lbd at
1–2 mg/ml were used directly for crystallization.
crystallization—crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °c in drops containing 2.0 ␮l of protein stock solution (5
mg/ml protein, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.3, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, ⬃100 mm nacl, 0.1% octyl-␤-glucoside, and 1 ␮m tnpr) mixed
with 1 ␮l of well solution (8%  xxxd2982xxx  3350, 300 mm  xxxd2534xxx ,
50 mm pipes, ph 6.5, and 10% glycerol) and 0.5 ␮l of 40%  xxxd18xxx  (v/v) and equilibrated against 1 ml of well solution. diamondshaped crystals grew in 2– 6 weeks, measuring ⬃50 ␮m across.
data collection and processing—crystals belong to the space group
p21 (unit cell parameters: a ⫽ 57.52 å; b ⫽ 64.50 å; c ⫽ 70.41 å; and ␤ ⫽
95.76°) and contain two molecules of pr-lbd in the asymmetric unit,
resulting in a solvent content of 44%. crystals were drawn through a

solution of 20% ethylene glycol and 80% well solution and cooled rapidly
in liquid nitrogen. diffraction data were collected using a rigaku rotating
anode x-ray generator and recorded on a raxis4 detector. intensities were
integrated and scaled using the programs denzo and scalepack (42).
phasing, model building, and refinement—the structure was determined by molecular replacement using the pr-lbd/p structure (41) as
the search model. after several iterative cycles of refinement using
cnx (43) and refmac5 (44) and model improvement building using
quanta (molecular simulations, inc.) and coot (45), tnpr was
placed and refined. final rwork and rfree values of 17.88 and 22.81%
were obtained (table i). figs. 8 and 9 were prepared using pymol, and
fig. 10 was prepared using coot (44, 45).
statistical evaluation of results—for all in vitro studies each experiment was run in triplicate. experiments were repeated at least three
times. values are presented as means ⫾ s.e. for different replicates. in
the t47d alkaline phosphatase assay a dose-response curve was generated for dose (x-axis) versus the rate of enzyme reaction (slope) (yaxis) for test compounds. square root-transformed data were used for
analysis of variance and nonlinear dose-response curve fitting for pr
and shbg competition binding assays and the t47d cell alkaline
phosphatase assay, whereas log transformation was used for luciferase
reporter assays. huber weighting was used to down weight the effects
of outliers. ec50 or ic50 values were calculated from the re-transformed
values. jmp software (sas institute, inc.) was used for both one-way
analysis of variance and non-linear dose-response analysis.

tnpr does not induce  xxxg590xxx  in dpx2
cells—in the dpx2 cells tnpr did not increase luciferase
activity at concentrations up to 25 ␮m, whereas the synthetic
progestin 3-kdg showed a dose-response induction on cyp3a4
(fig. 6). the fold induction over the control by 3-kdg was 1.7,
3.7, 8.3, and 21.3 at 1, 5, 10, and 25 ␮m, respectively. under the
same conditions, the positive control rifampicin showed 10,
21.6, 29.5, and 25-fold cyp3a4 induction at 1, 5, 10, and 25 ␮m,
respectively. these data indicate that 3-kdg induces cyp3a4,
whereas tnpr does not. therefore, it is less likely that tnpr
will interact with drugs that are metabolized by cyp3a4.

tains two ligand bound monomers that form a dimer. this
dimer interface is composed of residues from ␣-helices 11 and
12 and is similar to the dimer reported for p4䡠pr (fig. 8) (41).
a superposition of the p4䡠pr dimer with tnpr䡠pr gave an
average root mean square deviation of 0.25 å for all equivalent
c␣ atoms. the two monomers, a and b, which form the dimer
in the asymmetric unit of tnpr䡠pr have an average root mean
square deviation of 0.87 å for all c␣ atoms. these differences,
also seen in the p4䡠pr structure, are located at a crystal packing interface on the loop between ␣-helix 6 and ␣-helix 7. thus,
tnpr binding does not perturb the tertiary structure of pr
relative to p4, as overall differences between monomers in the
tnpr䡠pr structure are statistically more significant than differences between the p4䡠pr and tnpr䡠pr complexes.
this finding is consistent with the limited protease digestion
analysis indicating that tnpr triggered similar pr conformational changes to those of p4- and tmg-bound prs. ligandinduced adjustment in the pr binding pocket has also been

observed in the recently solved x-ray structures of  xxxd2751xxx  and  xxxd2665xxx  (47), where local shifts in both
protein main chain and side chain conformations allow these
ligands to be accommodated.
inspection of the tnpr ligand binding pocket does reveal
differences between the steroidal and the non-steroidal ligand
binding pockets. superposition of the p4 structure shows that
the 1-methyl-1h-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile ring of tnpr lies
roughly between the a and b rings of p4, and that the 1,4dihydro-3,1-benzoxazine-2-thione moiety (which is referred to
as “benzoxazine”) lies just above the c and d rings of p4 in the
direction of the protruding methyl groups of p4 (fig. 9). tnpr
presents its nitrile group as a hydrogen bond acceptor to the
amido group of gln725 (distance of 3 å) and arg766 (distance of
2.8 å), thereby preserving the hydrogen bonding network seen
previously between the 3-keto group of the steroids and these
residues. the benzoxazine moiety occupies approximately the
same space as rings c and d of p4 with similar hydrophobic
interactions. small adjustments in the position of the side
chains of several residues lining the pocket, primarily met756
(helix 5), met759 (helix 5), and met909 (helix 12), accommodate
the difference in shape between p4 and tnpr. the presence of
a hydrogen bond donor at the distal end of the ligand allows the
benzoxazine nh to form a hydrogen bond with the side chain
oxygen of asn719 (distance of 2.8 å). the orientation of the
asn719 side chain is fixed through hydrogen bonding with the
main chain oxygen atom of glu904, which contributes to securing the loop between helices 11 and 12 to the rest of the protein.

tnpr that is present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. single
molecules of the pr-lbd are shown in
spectral colors, with the n terminus in
blue and the c terminus in red.

although a water-mediated interaction has been reported previously between the c17 hydroxyl group of  xxxd2751xxx  and
asn719 residue (47), this novel direct interaction between the
ligand and the receptor clearly offers additional affinity of
tnpr to the pr.
tnpr presents its nitrile group and the benzoxazine nh for
hydrogen bonding with the protein, and the scaffold is thus
optimally positioned for hydrophobic contacts with the pocket.
the hydrogen bonding network and the hydrophobic interactions are similar to the interaction of p4 with the ligand binding
pocket but are notably achieved with a completely independent
small molecule scaffold (figs. 9 and 10).
tnpr is accommodated by the pr ligand binding pocket
better than the ligand binding pockets of the other closely
related receptors such as gr and ar (48 –50). in the pr,
residue phe794 (helix 7) is substituted by methionine in the
gr and ar, whereas leu797 (helix 7) takes the place of the
polar gln of the gr and ar. together, these two residues
contribute to the creation of a hydrophobic environment that
can better accommodate the two methyl substituents of
the benzoxazine ring. both the gr and ar have several
other conservative differences with respect to the pr
among the hydrophobic residues that line the ligand binding pocket, possibly contributing to the selectivity of tnpr
for pr.

tnpr is a potent ovulation inhibitor in the rat—in the rat,
tnpr inhibited ovulation in 100% of animals at 0.03 mg/kg
(ed100) when given orally. to achieve the same effect, the dose
for mpa and tmg was 1 mg/kg (fig. 11). thus, tnpr is
⬃30-fold more potent than these steroid progestins in a key
efficacy endpoint for contraception.

gestins are also known to affect the efficacy of other drugs
(56 – 60). these drug-drug interactions are caused by modulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes (61, 62). steroidal progestins such are  xxxd1849xxx  are metabolized primarily by
cyp3a4. cyp3a4 is known to be induced by several drugs that
are sometimes co-administered with oral contraceptives. elevated cyp3a4 concentrations can lead to lower efficacy of
contraceptives. results from recent metabolism studies clearly
demonstrate that tnpr is superior to currently marketed steroidal progestins. for example, glucuronidation is the major
metabolic pathway for tnpr, and tnpr is not metabolized by
cyp3a4 (data not shown). tnpr does not have the potential to
induce cyp3a4, whereas  xxxd2067xxx , a metabolite of
 xxxd1849xxx , has the capacity to induce this isozyme. tnpr
does not inhibit any of the major p450 enzymes (data not
shown), whereas steroidal progestins have the potential to
inhibit cyp2c19, an isozyme that is responsible for the metabolism of  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors such as omeprazole (36).
these characteristics of tnpr clearly demonstrate that, unlike
other steroidal progestins, the efficacy of tnpr will likely not
be affected by any concomitant drugs and that tnpr should
not interfere with the efficacy of other drugs.
the crystal structure of the pr/tnpr complex is the first
reported pr-lbd structure with a non-steroidal ligand. this
structure shows that tnpr retains many of the key interactions of p4 with the protein, albeit from an unrelated chemical
scaffold. as it is a fundamentally different compound, the common features of ligand binding between tnpr and p4 delineate
general features required for a potent pr agonist. furthermore, tnpr interacts with the protein in novel ways. tnpr
takes advantage of the ligand binding pocket even more effectively than p4, with a novel hydrogen bond as the basis for its
greater affinity for pr (41). comparisons with the gr and ar
help in understanding the subtle differences that make the pr
ligand binding pocket unique from those of other closely related
steroid receptors and show why tnpr takes advantage of it to
achieve ⬎250-fold selectivity for the pr (48 –50).
in summary, tnpr is a structurally novel nonsteroidal pr
agonist. it demonstrated potent pr agonist activity in vitro and
in vivo. tnpr has an excellent receptor selectivity profile and
improved pharmacological properties. because of its novel
chemical structure, tnpr may offer other unique biological
properties. in fact recent evidence shows that tnpr possesses
some tissue selective properties.2 the pr isoform-selective effect of tnpr is currently under investigation. finally, the
crystal structure of pr-lbd-tnpr has been resolved, which
supports the potent activity of this nonsteroidal compound.

although several nonsteroidal tissue-selective er modulators with an improved pharmacological profile and enhanced
clinical utility have been developed over the past few decades,
to our knowledge no nonsteroidal pr ligands have been in
clinical development to date. in this report, we describe the
identification and molecular and pharmacological characterization of a novel nonsteroidal pr agonist, tnpr. tnpr was
initially identified as a pr agonist through a medicinal chemistry effort based upon its in vitro activity in t47d cells. it
showed similar potency to potent steroidal compounds such as
tmg and mpa in the alkaline phosphatase assay in t47d
cells. however, tnpr had reduced efficacy in this in vitro
model (fig. 2) (34). the biological relevance of this reduced
efficacy in the breast cancer line is unclear and is currently
under investigation using in vivo models of mammary gland
development. in an artificial system using a mammalian twohybrid system to evaluate the interaction between pr and
coactivators such as  xxxg1510xxx  and  xxxg1512xxx , tnpr showed similar
potency and efficacy as the two steroidal progestins but was
much more potent than p4 or  xxxd2751xxx  (fig. 3 and data
not shown).
tnpr showed higher relative binding affinity as compared
with the tested reference steroid progestins in various species.
it was ⬃4 – 6-fold more potent than tmg and mpa on human
pr and up to 100-fold more potent than mpa on rat pr in the
competition binding assays. the increased binding affinity may
be explained by the additional hydrogen bond between tnpr
and pr as observed in the crystal structure discussed below.
importantly, tnpr demonstrated potent in vivo progestational
activity. in the ovulation inhibition model in the rat it was fully
efficacious at 0.03 mg/kg orally, ⬃30-fold more potent that
mpa and tmg (40). this enhanced progestational activity has
been shown in other animal models.2
tnpr demonstrated ⬎250-fold selectivity for the pr versus
other closely related steroid receptors. it interacted only
weakly with gr in vitro, and this activity was not detected in
vivo  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg, a dose that is 300-fold higher than the
efficacious dose (0.03 mg/kg in the rat ovulation inhibition
model; fig. 11 and data not shown). some of the side effects
(e.g. metabolic changes) of the clinically used steroid progestins
may be attributed to their interactions with other steroid receptors. for example, progestins with androgenic activity, such
as lng and mpa, have been shown to alter the plasma lipid
profile (51, 52). the improved selectivity profile of tnpr will
likely reduce these side effects.
shbg is a serum sex steroid binding protein produced by the
liver that regulates the availability of androgens and estrogens
to target tissues. it is well known that some synthetic steroids
bind to and/or regulate the production of shbg, thus affecting
endogenous sex steroid bioavailability (53–55). for example,
lng competes for shbg binding with an ic50 value of 16 nm
(fig. 5). it also dramatically reduces serum shbg levels when
given to primates (data not shown). unlike some steroidal
progestins, tnpr did not compete for shbg binding at concentrations up to 10,000 nm, and a dose that was 100-fold its
efficacious dose did not change serum shbg levels in primates.2 therefore, tnpr offers advantages over steroidal progestins in that it will not affect blood shbg levels and sex
hormone availability to the target tissues.
failures of contraceptives containing some steroidal progestins, although rare, are known to result from interactions
with other drugs. likewise, some oral contraceptives/pro-
