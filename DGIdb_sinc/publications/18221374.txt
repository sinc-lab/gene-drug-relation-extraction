abstract
ginkgolides, active constituents of  xxxd2199xxx  extracts,
potently block the  xxxg904xxx  chloride channel (glyr).
ginkgolides a, b, c and j are structurally similar, varying only
by the presence or absence of oxygens at their r1 and r2
positions. the aim of this study was to understand how variable ginkgolide groups bind to pore-lining 2¢ and 6¢ residues in
the a1 glyr. ginkgolide potency was not affected by g2¢a or
g2¢s mutations, suggesting 2¢ residues are not important for
ginkgolide coordination. analysis of the a1t6¢s glyr suggests
that ginkgolides bind to this receptor via hydrogen bonds between t6¢s and ginkgolide r1 hydroxyls. the abolition of
block by the t6¢a and t6¢v mutations but not by the t6¢s
mutation implies the existence a second transmembrane domain a-helical kink formed by hydrogen bonding between 6¢

threonine and serine sidechains and backbone carbonyl
oxygens. we also found that ginkgolide a binds in different
orientations in the closed and open states of a mutant glyr,
possibly reflecting its enhanced flexibility relative to other
ginkgolides. together these results indicate that small variations in ginkgolide structure or pore structure can lead to
drastic potency variations. this property may be exploited to
create improved pharmacological probes for discriminating
among anionic cys-loop receptor isoforms with 6¢ structural
variations.

the  xxxg904xxx  (glyr) chloride channel mediates
inhibitory neurotransmission in spinal motor reﬂex circuits
and nociceptive pathways (lynch 2004; zeilhofer 2005; betz
and laube 2006). it belongs to the cys-loop ligand gated ion
channel family that also includes the gaba type a receptor
(gabaar), the  xxxg456xxx , and the
serotonin type 3 receptor. cys-loop receptor subunits comprise a large n-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain,
followed by four a-helical transmembrane domains (m1–
m4), with the second transmembrane domain (m2) domain
lining the central water-ﬁlled pore (unwin 2005).
five glyr subunits have been identiﬁed (a1–a4, b).
embryonic receptors generally comprise a2 homomers or
a2b heteromers, whereas the a1b heteromer is the dominant
adult subtype (lynch 2004; betz and laube 2006). although
the b subunit is broadly distributed throughout the cns, it is
poorly expressed in immature neurons. the a1, a2 and a3
subunits all exhibit different neuronal distribution patterns
that are particularly evident in the superﬁcial dorsal horn of
the spinal cord (harvey et al. 2004) and retina (haverkamp
et al. 2003, 2004; heinze et al. 2007). the functional
consequences of the differential distribution patterns are

difﬁcult to establish as there are few pharmacological probes
that can effectively discriminate among glyr isoforms
(webb and lynch 2007).
ginkgolides, which are among the main active constituents of herbal extracts from the  xxxd2199xxx  tree, are
terpene trilactone molecules with a cage-like structure
consisting of six adjacent rings each containing ﬁve
bonded atoms (van beek 2005; nakanishi 2005). ginkgolides a, b, c, and j (ga, gb, gc, and gj) are

structurally similar and vary only by the presence or
absence of oxygen atoms at the r1 and r2 positions
(fig. 1a). the highly conserved ginkgolide structure means
that structure-activity analyses performed on  xxxg863xxx  incorporating mutations at candidate binding sites should
identify speciﬁc molecular interactions between the ginkgolide variable groups and the receptor.
several lines of evidence suggested that ginkgolides bind
in the 2¢–6¢ region of the pore early studies on native rat
neuronal  xxxg863xxx  suggested that gb acted as a classical pore
blocker (kondratskaya et al. 2002; ivic et al. 2003). a
molecular docking model supported the feasibility of a
binding site in this region (hawthorne et al. 2006) and
mutagenesis studies provided limited experimental evidence
for such a model. for example, the a1 subunit g2¢a

mutation (the a1 to a2 subunit substitution) successfully
replicated the modest ginkgolide sensitivity difference
between the a1 and a2 glyr homomers (kondratskaya
et al. 2005; hawthorne et al. 2006). however, apart from the
non-conservative t6¢f mutation (the a1 to b subunit
substitution) which abolished ginkgolide binding (hawthorne et al. 2006), the role of 6¢ threonines in coordinating
ginkgolides has not been investigated.
an understanding of how ginkgolides bind in the glyr
pore could place constraints on pore structure and could lead
to the synthesis of more speciﬁc subunit selective antagonists, which could be valuable tools to pharmacologically
separate native glyr subtypes. accordingly, the aim of this
study was to investigate the effects of conservative and nonconservative 2¢ and 6¢ mutations on receptor sensitivity to

bind in the a1 glyr pore.

methods
mutagenesis and expression of glyr cdnas
the human glyr a1 subunit cdna was subcloned into the pcis2
plasmid vector (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa), and the b subunit
was subcloned into the pires2-egfp plasmid vector (clontech).
mutations were incorporated using the quickchange mutagenesis
kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). the presence of the correct
mutation was conﬁrmed by automated dna sequencing of plasmid
dna isolated using the biorad aurum miniprep kit (hercules, ca,
usa).
recombinant  xxxg863xxx  were functionally expressed in hek293
cells. cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin 30 u/ml
(gibcobrl, grand island, ny, usa). the day before transfection,
cells were split onto glass coverslips in 3 cm diameter culture
dishes. transfection was then performed via a calcium phosphate
transfection protocol. after exposure to the transfection solution
overnight, the cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered
saline and the culture medium was replaced. electrophysiological
recordings were then performed in the 2 days following washing. to
visually identify cells that had taken up exogenous cdna, empty
pegfp vector (clontech) was co-transfected with the a1 glyr
cdna in a 1 : 10 ratio. this was not used when transfecting a1b
heteromers as green ﬂuorescent protein ﬂuorescence was used to
identify b subunit expression.
electrophysiology
currents were measured by whole-cell patch clamp recording of
cells visually identiﬁed through a ﬂuorescent microscope. each
coverslip was used for up to 1 h of recording after placement in
control solution containing (mm): 140 nacl, 5 kcl, 2 cacl2, 1
mgcl2, 10 hepes, 10 glucose, adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh.
patch-clamp pipettes were made from borosilicate glass hematocrit
tubing (vitrex, modulohm, denmark) pulled with a horizontal puller
( xxxg2408xxx , sutter instruments, novato, ca, usa). the resistance of the
tips varied between 1 and 3 mx when ﬁlled with cscl pipette
solution containing (in mm): 145 cscl, 2 cacl2, 2 mgcl2, 10
hepes, 10 egta, adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh. cells were
voltage-clamped at )40 mv. solutions were applied to cells via
gravity-induced perfusion through parallel micro-tubules. the
perfusion system was under the control of a manual micromanipulator and solution exchange between adjacent tubes was routinely
complete within 100 ms. current responses were recorded with an
axopatch 1d ampliﬁer and pclamp9 software (axon instruments,
union city, ca, usa), digitally ﬁltered at 500 hz and digitized
at 1 khz. experiments were performed at room temperature
(21–24c).
glycine and the ginkgolides were dissolved in water to make
100 mm and 10 mm stocks, respectively, and stored frozen at
)20c. on the day of recording, frozen stocks were thawed and
diluted with control solution to the desired concentration. the
ginkgolides were obtained as follows: ga from sigma (st louis,
mo, usa) or tauto biotech co. ltd. (shanghai, china), gb from

biomol (plymouth meeting, pa, usa), gc from mp biomedicals
(eschwege, germany), and gj from tauto biotech co. ltd.
data analysis
all results are expressed as mean ± sem of three or more
independent experiments. the hill equation was used to calculate
the hill coefﬁcients (nh) and the half-maximal concentrations for
activation and inhibition (ec50 and ic50, respectively). to achieve
this, individual dose-response curves were ﬁtted using a non-linear
least squares algorithm (sigmaplot 9.0, jandel scientiﬁc, san
rafael, ca, usa). the effect of each ginkgolide concentration on
current magnitude was normalized and presented as i/imax, where i
is the amplitude of the inhibited current and imax is the amplitude of
the current activated by glycine only. statistical signiﬁcance was
determined by paired or unpaired student’s t-test, as stated in the
text, with p < 0.05 representing signiﬁcance.

results
functional characterization of gj inhibition of
recombinant  xxxg863xxx 
we ﬁrst investigated the subunit-sensitivity and functional
properties of gj inhibition as these have not previously been
performed using electrophysiology. the inhibitory potency
of gj was compared at a1 homomeric and a1b heteromeric
 xxxg863xxx . the gj dose-responses were quantitated in the
presence of an ec30 (20 lm) glycine concentration. figure 1(b) and (c) shows example current traces in the presence
of indicated gj concentrations together with the averaged
inhibitory dose response curves for each receptor. gj
inhibited the a1 glyr with a mean ic50 of 5.3 ± 1.3 lm
and an nh of 0.9 ± 0.1 (both n = 5). it was signiﬁcantly
more potent (p < 0.05, student’s unpaired t-test) at the a1b
glyr, with a mean ic50 of 1.6 ± 0.5 lm and an nh of
0.7 ± 0.1 (both n = 5). previous electrophysiological studies
on recombinantly expressed a1  xxxg863xxx  (jensen et al. 2007)
and native neuronal  xxxg863xxx  (chatterjee et al. 2003) also
reported ic50 values for gj in the low micromolar range.
we next investigated the use-dependence and glycine
concentration-dependence of gj inhibition at the a1 glyr.
use-dependence was investigated as shown in fig. 1(d). the
rate of recovery from inhibition by 3 lm ginkgolide was
quantitated by ﬁtting a single exponential to the recovery
phase (as indicated by 2 in fig. 1d). although these single
time constant ﬁts oversimplify the complex activation
process, we employ them here only to compare differences
in current activation rates for the purpose of detecting bound
ginkgolide molecules. accordingly, we also ﬁtted single
exponentials to the glycine-only activation phase both
without gj pre-incubation (as indicated by 1 in fig. 1d)
and following incubation with 3 lm gj in the closed state
(as indicated by 3 in fig. 1d). the three time constants (as
indicated by 1, 2, and 3 in fig. 1d) were all quantitated in
each of six cells with the averages and statistical comparisons

presented in fig. 1(e). these results indicate that gj can
access its binding site only when channels are bound by
glycine. thus, gj shares a use-dependent blocking mechanism with the other three ginkgolides (kondratskaya et al.
2002; hawthorne et al. 2006).
the glycine concentration-dependence of gj inhibition
was tested by comparing the percentage block caused by
3 lm gj on currents activated by ec30 (20 lm) and
saturating (2 mm) glycine concentrations. averaged over
ﬁve cells, a similar proportion of block at both glycine
concentrations showed that gj inhibition is non-competitive
(fig. 1f and g). ga, gb, and gc also inhibit homomeric
 xxxg863xxx  in a non-competitive manner (kondratskaya et al.
2002; hawthorne et al. 2006).
the r19¢ residue lies at the external end of the m2
domain. we recently discovered that the glyr a1 r19¢c
mutation modiﬁes the pore structure so that substances that
bind in the pore are unable to dissociate from their binding

sites while the channel is closed but can dissociate efﬁciently
when the channel is opened (hawthorne and lynch 2005).
pore-binding compounds are thus ‘trapped’ in the closed
state. so far we have shown that  xxxd2947xxx  (ptx), bilobalide
and ga exhibit trap behavior (hawthorne and lynch 2005;
hawthorne et al. 2006), with evidence to date suggesting
that all three compounds bind in the 2¢–6¢ region of the glyr
pore (hawthorne and lynch 2005; hawthorne et al. 2006;
yang et al. 2007) we thus infer that any substance that
exhibits trap behavior also binds in the pore. we would also
infer that any substance that exhibits a different recovery rate
after having been trapped in the pore is likely to adopt a
different binding conﬁrmation in the closed channel state. in
the present study we used this approach to test whether
ginkgolides adopt different binding conformations in the
closed and open channel states. figure 2 shows the outcome
of these experiments. in the case of ga, we used a saturating
(20 mm) glycine concentration and a 10 lm ga concentra-

the continued presence of glycine. the right trace, from the same cell,

was reapplied 60 s later revealing ga trap (i.e., delayed recovery from
block) and a slower rate of recovery. the right panel compares
averaged ga recovery profiles from five cells in the continued presence of glycine (filled circles) and after 60 s trap (unfilled circles),
normalized to the pre-blocked current magnitude. the recovery at all
points after 3 s recovery time is significantly slower after trap

(p < 0.05, students paired t-test). note that the shape of the recovery
profile is also different. (b) similar experiment to (a) except that 5 mm
glycine was used to activate the channels and 10 lm gj was used to
inhibit the channels. the recovery profiles averaged from five cells
(right panel) reveal no significant change in recovery rate in trapped
versus untrapped gj. note that the slight displacement of the two
curves is because of a small degree of gj recovery from block in the
closed state. (c, d) sample experiments revealing no significant
recovery from block by 10 lm gb or gc in a1r19¢c  xxxg863xxx  activated by

extent of baseline drift. similar results were recorded in each of four
cells exposed to gb and gc.

tion. ga was ﬁrst applied and removed from a1r19¢c  xxxg863xxx 
that were maintained in the open conformation by the
constant application of glycine (fig. 2a, left). in a second
experiment, glycine and ga were removed simultaneously
after ga-induced block (fig. 2a, middle). in this experiment,
recovery from block was initiated only after the re-introduction of glycine, indicating that ga was effectively trapped in
the pore. the recovery rates from ga block in the continued
open state and in the open state following a 60 s trap were
compared as shown in fig. 2(a) (right). the recovery rate
was signiﬁcantly slower after trap, suggesting that ga is
forced into a different binding conformation by channel
closure. similar experiments were performed with the other
ginkgolides with the only difference being that 5 mm (ec50)
glycine was used to reduce the recovery rate (hawthorne and
lynch 2005) in order to detect small recovery rate differences. ginkgolides b, c, and j were all applied  xxxd1891xxx  lm. as
shown in fig. 2(b), gj was also trapped in the closed state of
the channel, although there was no signiﬁcant difference in
its recovery rate before and after trap. thus, gj seems to
maintain its initial binding position even after being trapped
in the closed state. channels blocked by gb and gc showed
little recovery even after several minutes, indicating that
these ginkgolides were not able to dissociate efﬁciently from
their binding sites in the open state (fig. 2c and d). similar
results were observed in four cells exposed to gb and gc.
thus, recovery rates could not be quantitated for these
ginkgolides.
effects of 2¢ and 6¢ mutations on ginkgolide sensitivity
as our previous study employed relatively non-conservative,
subunit-speciﬁc pore mutations (e.g., g2¢p, p2¢g, t6¢f)
(hawthorne et al. 2006), it provided little detail about the
chemical nature of binding interactions. in the present study
we used a mutagenesis strategy designed to probe the
binding mechanisms of the four ginkgolides. four 6¢ mutants
were chosen for analysis: a1t6¢s, a1t6¢a, a1t6¢g, and a1t6¢v.
the small b-branched sidechain of threonine exposes a polar
hydroxyl group and a non-polar methyl group to the pore,
giving it the ability to participate in both hydrogen bonds and
non-speciﬁc hydrophobic interactions, respectively. serine,
generally considered a conservative substitution for threonine, maintains the reactive hydroxyl group attached to the bcarbon, although the hydrophobic methyl group is lost. the
absence of a methyl group increases the accessibility of the
hydroxyl group, possibly offering more opportunities for
hydrogen bond formation. valine maintains the b-branched
sidechain structure but replaces the threonine hydroxyl with a
second hydrophobic methyl. both the hydroxyl and methyl
groups are absent in alanine, which has a short, very nonreactive side chain. glycine was employed to test the effect
of completely removing the threonine side chain. while the
single proton side chain of glycine is non-reactive, its small
size can expose reactive backbone groups. at the 2¢ position,

we tested the ginkgolide sensitivity of the a1g2¢a and a1g2¢s
 xxxg863xxx .
the glycine ec50 and nh values for most of these mutant
 xxxg863xxx  have recently been published (yang et al. 2007). the
only exception is the a1t6¢g glyr which exhibited mean
glycine ec50 and nh values of 516 ± 119 lm and 1.81 ±
0.21 (both n = 4 cells), respectively. ginkgolide inhibitory
dose-responses were recorded in the presence of ec50
glycine concentrations for each mutant glyr. these concentrations were as follows (in lm): a1t6¢s, 1; a1t6¢a, 6;
a1t6¢g, 500; a1t6¢v, 400; a1g2¢a, 30; and a1g2¢s, 40.
we found that the t6¢a and t6¢v mutations completely
eliminated the ability of all ginkgolides to block the pore.
shown in fig. 3(a) and (b) are sample currents recorded from
cells expressing a1t6¢a and a1t6¢v  xxxg863xxx . the a1t6¢a  xxxg863xxx 
showed a transient potentiation upon initial application of a
30 lm concentration of any of the four ginkgolides. this
potentiation decayed to near the control current level, thus
providing no evidence for block (fig. 3a). a transient
inhibition was also observed when ginkgolides were
removed. the a1t6¢a  xxxg863xxx  also consistently showed a
transient potentiation upon removal of glycine before
channel closure (e.g., fig. 3a). similar results were observed
for all four ginkgolides in each of nine cells expressing
a1t6¢a  xxxg863xxx . note that the off-transients generally exhibited
signiﬁcant rundown with repeated glycine applications and
this may be the reason they are absent in the a1t6¢a glyr
traces displayed previously (yang et al. 2007).
the a1t6¢v glyr displayed a rapid and almost complete
desensitization upon glycine application (fig. 3b). surprisingly, we observed that 30 lm concentrations of each of
the four ginkgolides produced strong potentiation (e.g.,
fig. 3b). similar effects were observed for all four ginkgolides (data not shown). averaged over four cells, 30 lm
concentrations of ga, gb, gc, and gj potentiated the ec50
glycine current by 70 ± 15, 65 ± 10, 77 ± 6 and 53 ± 18%,
respectively. using a paired t-test, none of these values are
statistically different from each other.
averaged inhibitory dose-response curves for each ginkgolide at the a1t6¢s, a1t6¢g, a1g2¢a, and a1g2¢s  xxxg863xxx  are
presented in fig. 3(c–f) with mean parameters of best ﬁt
summarized in table 1. both the t6¢s and t6¢g mutations
caused a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in sensitivity to all
ginkgolides relative to the wild type (wt) control (fig. 3c
and d, table 1). although the four ginkgolides were
equipotent inhibitors of the a1wt glyr, large variations in
potency were present at both 6¢ mutant receptors. of
particular interest, 100 lm ga produced no signiﬁcant
inhibition of the a1t6¢g glyr and 100 lm gj produced no
signiﬁcant inhibition of the a1t6¢s glyr. pooled results from
both mutant  xxxg863xxx , which are discussed in detail below, do
suggest any obvious pattern of interaction between the 6¢
sidechains and the variable ginkgolide groups. the nh for
gb inhibition of the a1t6¢s glyr was increased signiﬁcantly

relative to the a1wt glyr, implying the existence of multiple
gb inhibitory sites or an allosteric mechanism of inhibition.
in contrast to 6¢ mutations, the 2¢ mutations had little
inﬂuence on ginkgolide sensitivity (fig. 3e and f). the only
exception was a modest but signiﬁcant increase in gc
sensitivity at both the a1g2¢aand a1g2¢s  xxxg863xxx  (table 1). as
alanine and serine contribute to different bond types and gc
incorporates hydroxyl groups at the r1 and r2 positions, this
does not point to a speciﬁc interaction. these data suggest
that the 2¢ residue has little involvement in directly
coordinating ginkgolides within the glyr pore.

discussion
do ginkgolides bind in the pore?
several lines of evidence strongly suggest that ginkgolides in
the 6¢ pore-lining region. first, molecular docking simulations demonstrated the feasibility of ga binding in this
region (hawthorne et al. 2006). second, ginkgolides display
classic pore blocker attributes including use-dependence and

non-competitive inhibition (kondratskaya et al. 2002; ivic
et al. 2003; hawthorne et al. 2006). third, ginkgolides and
ptx are both trapped in the a1r19¢c glyr in the closed state
(hawthorne and lynch 2005; hawthorne et al. 2006)
(present study). because ptx is known to bind in the 6¢
pore-lining region (yang et al. 2007), it is reasonable to
conclude by functional association that ginkgolides bind in a
similar location. finally, as discussed in detail below, the
variable effect of 6¢ mutations on the sensitivity of different
ginkgolides (fig. 3) provides evidence for a direct interaction.
it is unlikely that the ginkgolide potentiation seen in the
a1t6¢v glyr is mediated by a 6¢ binding site as the
ginkgolide diameter is equal to the pore diameter at this point
(hawthorne et al. 2006). on the basis of the anomalously
low ginkgolide sensitivity of the ﬂuorescence of a rhodamine
label attached to r19¢c, we recently postulated the existence
of an additional low afﬁnity ginkgolide site outside the pore
(pless et al. 2007). one possibility is that the non-conservative t6¢v mutation alters m2 conformation in a manner that

variable ginkgolide groups do not interact strongly with 2¢
residues
the effects of the g2¢s and g2¢a mutations on ginkgolide
potency were virtually insigniﬁcant, indicating that reactive
ginkgolide groups are unlikely to interact strongly with 2¢
residues. our previous conclusion for a direct interaction
between the r2 ginkgolide group and the 2¢ residue
involved analysis of glycine to proline mutations (and
proline to glycine mutations) in the a1b heteromeric glyr
(hawthorne et al. 2006). the highly non-conservative
nature of this substitution coupled with the poorly conserved m2 domain sequences of the a1 and b subunits
mean that the results of that study are unlike to pertain to
the homomeric a1 glyr investigated here. together, these
ginkgolide results ﬁt well with a recent report characterizing
ptx interactions in the homomeric a1 glyr pore (yang
et al. 2007). that study found ﬁrstly that ptx was ligated
by 6¢ threonines but had little energetic interaction with 2¢
pore-lining residues, and secondly that introduction of the b
subunit altered the way in which ptx sensitivity was
inﬂuenced by 2¢ mutations.
interactions between ginkgolides and the 6¢ threonine
ginkgolides possess two invariant oh groups plus two
variable oh groups (at r1 and r2), any or all of which
may be important for hydrogen bonding with t6¢.
elimination of the t6¢ hydrophobic bonding capability
by the t6¢s substitution caused a signiﬁcant but highly
variable reduction in the potency of all four ginkgolides.
ga and gj, which exhibited the most dramatic loss of
potency, both have a non-reactive hydrogen atom at r1.
one possibility is that the ﬂexible serine hydroxyl may
move sufﬁciently to coordinate gb and gc via their r1
hydroxyl, which may partially compensate for the loss of a
crucial hydrophobic interaction between the t6¢ methyl
group and a moiety common to all ginkgolides. alternatively, the r1 hydroxyl of gb and gc could allow an
intermolecular bond with the shared r10 hydroxyl in the
a1wt glyr (ivic et al. 2003). in the a1t6¢s glyr, it might
be more energetically favorable for the r1 hydroxyl to
form a hydrogen bond with the pore rather than with r10.
experiments aimed at testing the role of 6¢ hydrophobic
interactions (via the t6¢v and t6¢a mutations) were not
informative as they rendered the ginkgolide inhibitory site
dysfunctional.
because gb and ptx exhibit strong similarities in the
locations of key functional groups (ivic et al. 2003),
knowledge of the ptx binding mechanism (yang et al.
2007) could may be useful in predicting the ginkgolide
binding mechanism. overlaying the molecular structures of
ptx and gb in the a1 glyr pore predicts that the r1
ginkgolide group lies in the vicinity of the 6¢ residue and
that the r2 group is close to the 2¢ residue. this ﬁts with
the functional data from the a1t6¢s glyr described above.

 xxxg904xxx  ginkgolide binding site | 1425

thus, the four ginkgolides may bind in very similar
orientations in the a1wt and a1t6¢s  xxxg863xxx .
the pattern of ic50 values at the a1t6¢g glyr does not
assist in clarifying the role of t6¢ in ginkgolide coordination.
ga and gc exhibited the most dramatic losses of potency
although they differ in structure at both the r1 and r2
positions. gj and gb, which were affected to a lesser extent,
also differ in structure at both positions. these results
strongly suggest that different ginkgolides bind in different
orientations in the a1t6¢g glyr pore. it is difﬁcult to predict
how each might bind as 6¢ glycine substitutions could cause
complex changes to the binding pocket structure and
chemistry by enhancing backbone ﬂexibility and exposing
reactive backbone groups.
it is relevant to consider why ginkgolides do not inhibit
a1t6¢a or a1t6¢v  xxxg863xxx  despite t6¢a being a generally
more conservative mutation than t6¢g. theoretical studies
have postulated the existence of a hydrogen bond between
the oc atom of serine and threonine and the i-3 or i-4
backbone carbonyl oxygen that induces a stereotypical
kink in the a-helix backbone (gray and matthews 1984;
ballesteros et al. 2000). indeed, such a bond involving 6¢
serines or threonines is thought to be important for
forming the central kink in the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor m2 domain (sankararamakrishnan and samsom
1994). an experimental analysis of a g protein-coupled
receptor transmembrane helix provided evidence not only
that serines and threonines induce a local helical kink but
that valines and alanines do not (govaerts et al. 2001).
because glycine essentially behaves as a swivel, the
glycine substitution may achieve a similar kink. the
observed correlation between 6¢ mutation and the magnitude of its effect on ginkgolide sensitivity suggests that a
backbone kink induced by 6¢ threonines or serines may be
essential for the formation of a high afﬁnity ginkgolide
inhibitory site.
ginkgolide a may bind in multiple orientations
figure 2(a) showed that ga dissociated at a slower rate
after being trapped in the closed conformation of the
a1r19¢c glyr. this is strong evidence that the ga binding
orientation is different in the closed state. on the other
hand, gj dissociates at the same rate from both the open
and closed channel conformations implying either that
interactions initially formed by gj in the pore remained
ﬁxed when the channel closed, or that its orientation in the
closed state was energetically equivalent. a comparison of
ginkgolide crystal structures revealed two of the six ﬁvemembered rings in the ga molecule deviate signiﬁcantly
from those of the other ginkgolides (zhao et al. 2002).
one possibility suggested by (ivic et al. 2003) is that ga
has the least number of hydroxyl groups, and hence its
molecular conformation is not held as stifﬂy. this
ﬂexibility may be the reason why ga can take advantage

of a lower energy state within the closed pore, whereas the
greater rigidity of other ginkgolides may prevent this
adaptation.
it is evident in fig. 2(a) and (b) that the recovery from
ginkgolide block in the a1r19¢c glyr exhibits both fast and
slow components. this could result from different rates of
unbinding from high and low afﬁnity sites or from different
rates of unbinding in liganded closed and open states.
furthermore, as noted above, gj exhibits a ﬁnite rate of
unblock in the closed unliganded state as noted above. as
these mechanisms appear to be speciﬁc to the a1r19¢c glyr,
we have not investigated them.
ginkgolides are sensitive reporters of their binding site
environment
two studies have screened synthetic ginkgolide derivatives with the aim of identifying the structural requirements required for high potency at the glyr (jaracz
et al. 2004; jensen et al. 2007). both found that minor
alterations to structure were enough to eliminate
potency, and that rigidity of the skeleton was important
for activity. this ﬁts well with the ﬁndings of the present
study, with the exception that we have made minor
modiﬁcations to pore structure rather than to ginkgolide
structure.
the results of all three analyses suggest that variations
in the number and position of attached hydroxyls,
originally thought to be a useful tool for deducing
ginkgolide binding orientation, may greatly impact on the
ability of ginkgolides to bind. this greatly complicates the
task of ﬁnding precise molecular binding determinants. if
slight changes in bond angles because of subtle structural
differences imposed by single non-conserved groups is the
reason for signiﬁcant variations in potencies, then it may
be possible to synthesize molecules with enhanced subunit
speciﬁcity and greater differences in speciﬁcity for a given
channel isoform. this could lead to an optimized set of
pharmacological tools for probing the roles of different
glyr isoforms.
as ginkgolides also block gabaars (huang et al.
2004), it is feasible that ginkgolide derivatives may also
be developed as subunit-speciﬁc gabaar antagonists.
the gabaar may be of particular interest because
although most gabaar subunits also contain threonines
at the 6¢ position, some subunits do not. for example,
the mouse and rat e subunits contain 6¢ serines (sinkkonen
et al. 2000) and the rat q2 subunit contains a 6¢
methionine (zhang et al. 1995). in addition, mouse and
human s subunits contain 7¢ serines (sinkkonen et al.
2000). because naturally occurring ginkgolides are
highly sensitive to the identity of the a1 glyr 6¢ residue,
it is possible they may be useful for pharmacologically identifying gabaars incorporating e, s or q2
subunits.

conclusion
we conclude that ga binds in different orientations in the
closed and open states of the a1r19¢c glyr, which may
reﬂect its enhanced ﬂexibility relative to the other
ginkgolides. ginkgolide sensitivity was not strongly
affected by conservative mutations to the 2¢ pore-lining
glycine. in contrast, the t6¢s mutation affects the potency
of ginkgolides in a pattern that suggests that a hydrogen
bond between the variable r1 hydroxyl group and the 6¢
serine is important for ginkgolide potency. however, there
is no obvious pattern in the effect of the t6¢g mutation on
the ginkgolide potency sequence. the retention of high
potency block in the t6¢s and t6¢g mutants and the
abolition of block in the t6¢a and t6¢v mutants may be
because of the elimination of a local kink in the m2 helix
formed by hydrogen bonding between the sidechains of
threonines and serines and backbone carbonyl oxygens.
together these results are consistent with previous studies
showing that small variations in ginkgolide structure or
pore structure can lead to large differences in potency. we
speculate that this property may be exploited to create
improved pharmacological probes for discriminating
among glyr and gabaar isoforms with structural
variations at the 6¢ level.
