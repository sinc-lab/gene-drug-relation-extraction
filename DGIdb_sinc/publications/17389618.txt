dietary folate and alcohol consumption as well as polymorphic
variants in one-carbon metabolism genes may modulate risk of
colorectal adenoma through aberrant dna methylation and altered nucleotide synthesis and repair. we assessed the association
of 24 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps)
in 13 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and risk of
colorectal adenoma in 556 incident cases and 557 controls nested
in the nurses’ health study. most of the snps were not associated
with risk of colorectal adenoma. we did, however, observe a modest increased risk among carriers of the transcobalamin (tcn) ii
259 pro/arg þ arg/arg variant (odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence
interval 1.09–2.02) for colorectal adenoma. the tcn ii
pro259arg polymorphism may affect tcn binding and transport
of  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  and thus warrants further investigation of its biological function. in addition, the  xxxg1480xxx 
( xxxg1480xxx ) arg415cys and  xxxg1480xxx  ser284thr variant carriers, also
in the  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  pathway, have suggestive associations with
advanced colorectal adenoma (defined as being larger than
1 cm, villous, tubular–villous or carcinoma in situ histology). we
observed significant evidence for departure from multiplicative
interaction for the betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase
( xxxg262xxx ) arg239gln with dietary methyl status (based on intake
of dietary folate,  xxxd2595xxx  and alcohol intake) in relation to
colorectal adenoma; no such interaction was observed for the
other 23 snps. further investigation is required to validate the
association of the polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic
genes and risk of colorectal adenoma.

introduction
low dietary folate (1–10) and high alcohol consumption (11,13) have
been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma.
folate, antagonized by alcohol, is a b-complex nutrient involved in
the transfer of single-carbon moieties essential for purine and pyrimidine synthesis necessary for maintenance of genomic integrity and
dna methylation reactions (14,15). hypermethylation of promoter sequences influences gene expression. global hypomethylation (16–19)
and regional dna hypermethylation (20–22) as well as altered
nucleotide synthesis and repair (6) are associated with folate-related
colorectal carcinogenesis. furthermore, hypermethylation may be an

materials and methods
study population
the nhs began in 1976 when 121 700 female registered nurses in the usa
between the ages of 30 and 55 years completed a self-administered questionnaire on their medical history and baseline health-related exposures. subsequently, these participants have completed a mailed, self-administered
questionnaire biennially to update information on their lifestyle, medical history and diet (every 2–4 years).
in 1989 and 1990, 32 826 women, between the ages of 43 and 69 years,
provided blood samples. upon receipt, samples were immediately centrifuged
and aliquoted into plasma, red blood cells and buffy coat fractions for storage
in liquid nitrogen. as described previously (33,40), cases of colorectal adenoma and controls were chosen from among women who supplied a blood
sample, had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (by 1998) after providing a blood
sample and were free from diagnosed cancer (except non-melanoma skin
cancer), ulcerative colitis and adenoma before endoscopy. newly diagnosed
polyps (in individuals who never had a polyp diagnosed before the date of
blood draw) were reported on the 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 or 1998 questionnaires. these polyps were confirmed to be adenomatous by review of histopathological reports and were classified by location (proximal or distal colon or
rectum), size (,1 cm, 1 cm) and histology (tubular, tubulovillous, villous,
carcinoma in situ) by study investigators blinded to the exposure information.
advanced adenoma was defined as large adenomas that were 1 cm in size
and/or tubulovillous, villous or carcinoma in situ histology. between 1989 and
1998, 557 women with colorectal adenoma were identified and one control was
selected for each case, matched on year of birth, year of blood draw, time
period of endoscopy, indication for endoscopy and time period of first or most
recent endoscopy. one case was subsequently found to be hyperplastic and thus
was excluded from the analysis. thus, the total number of cases and controls
analyzed in this study were 556 cases and 557 controls. diet was assessed
in 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1996 with a semiquantitative food frequency
questionnaire.
genotyping methods
genotyping was performed at the dana-farber/harvard cancer center highthroughput polymorphism core. dna was extracted from 50 ll buffy coat
fractions diluted with 150 ll of pbs by the qiagen qiaamp blood kit
(qiagen, chatsworth, ca) spin protocol. the genotypes of the one-carbon

early event in colorectal carcinogenesis and may be involved in the
progression of adenomas to cancer (21,23–25).
case–control studies and prospective studies have supported the
role of dietary folate in relation to colorectal adenoma risk
(1,26,27). low folate intake (1,28–31), and low circulating folate
levels (26,29,32) were associated with a greater incidence of colorectal adenomas, whereas higher folate intake was inversely associated
with recurrence of colorectal adenoma (7).
genetic variants in  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx )
at codon 222 and 429 have been studied in relation to colorectal
adenoma risk (27,33–38). high intake of alcohol (30þ g/day) was
associated with increased risk of colorectal adenoma among men with
the  xxxg1475xxx  222 val/val variant (5,36), but not with the  xxxg1475xxx 
gln429ala single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) (36). thus, the
one-carbon metabolism genes may be associated with risk of colorectal adenoma under conditions of low dietary folate status.
although the association of additional polymorphisms in the onecarbon metabolism genes has been examined in colorectal cancer
(36,39), the association with colorectal adenoma risk among women
remains unclear. we conducted a prospective nested case–control
study in the nursesõ health study (nhs) to evaluate the association
between the 24 non-synonymous polymorphisms in the one-carbon
pathway, selected in 13 genes (figure 1; supplementary table i is
available at carcinogenesis online). because the associations of the
genotypes may differ by dietary factors that influence methyl status,
we also evaluated the interaction of these snps with total folate,
 xxxd2595xxx  and alcohol intake.

one-carbon metabolic snps and colorectal adenoma risk

polymorphisms were determined by measuring end-point fluorescence using the
5# nuclease assay (taqman) on the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection
system (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) (41). the 24 non-synonymous
snps (nssnps) were identified through the nci snp500cancer database
(http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov), the dbsnp database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/snp) and the international hapmap project database (http://www.
hapmap.org). the snps that were included in this study all resulted in amino
acid changes and therefore are potentially functional. the  xxxg806xxx  his475tyr
snp was not referenced in the above databases, but was investigated in relation
to serum folate levels (60). initially, 26 snps in 15 genes were selected with
a minor allele frequency 2%. however, we were unable to design a taqman
assay for the rs1051266 snp and the rs1143693 snp was not polymorphic
in our data (39). therefore, our analysis included the known 24 nssnps in
13 genes. koushik et al. (39) used the polymorphism phenotyping and sorting
intolerant from tolerant web tools to predict the potential effect of these snps
on protein structure and function.
quality control was ensured by including a random 10% of the samples in
the 96 well plates as duplicates. the quality control samples served as internal
controls to validate the genotyping methods; there was 100% concordance of
the quality control samples. laboratory personnel were blinded to the status
(case, control or quality control) of samples. the median genotyping success
for the 24 snps was 95%.
statistical analysis
a total of 556 incident adenoma cases and 557 controls were included in the
analyses, although the number of cases and controls for some of the polymorphisms was slightly lower because of missing data. genotype distributions
were evaluated for agreement with hardy–weinberg equilibrium by the chisquare test. we evaluated differences among cases and controls using the chi-

square test for categorical variables and the paired t-test for continuous
variables.
we used both conditional and unconditional logistic regression for the analyses to compute genotype odds ratios (ors), 95% confidence intervals (cis),
allelic trend tests and interactions. in the multivariate models, we adjusted for
known risk factors for adenomas, including family history of colorectal cancer,
pack-years of smoking, post-menopausal hormone use, body mass index, physical activity, aspirin use, total energy intake and consumption of red meat,
alcohol and folate. unconditional logistic analyses explicitly adjusted for
matching variables, including age, history of previous endoscopy (before blood
draw), year of endoscopy, as well as month/year of blood collection and fasting
status at time of blood draw.
the snps were initially examined with the codominant model, evaluating
the snps as a three-level categorical variable, where the homozygous variant
genotype and heterozygous genotype are compared with the homozygous wildtype referent category. p values (43) were obtained from the tests for linear
trend of log and ors were calculated using an ordered categorical variable by
assigning scores to the genotypes: 0 (no variant allele), 1 (carrying one variant
allele) and 2 (carrying two variant alleles).
in addition, we have also evaluated the snps using the 2 degree-of-freedom
likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without the genotype variable.
overall, most of the p values for the genotypes in the one-carbon metabolism
genes did not change significance (data not shown) with the 2 degree-of-freedom likelihood ratio test. the  xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx ) 175 snp
had a p value 0.03 from the 2 degree-of-freedom likelihood ratio test that may
be driven by the multivariate results for the  xxxg1480xxx  leu/leu variant or 1.59
(95% ci 1.03–2.45). however, since the majority of snps had a minor allele
frequency of ,5%, we also used the dominant model, comparing variant
carriers with the referent homozygous wild-type.

in the figure and the snp symbol, codon, amino acid change and reference number are indicated in parenthesis below. many of the genes in the one-carbon
metabolic pathway, such as 5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx  ala222val, rs1801133;  xxxg1475xxx  glu429ala, rs1801131), contribute to prymidine
and purine synthesis as well as dna methylation reactions. folate hydrolase ( xxxg806xxx  tyr75his, rs202676;  xxxg806xxx  his475tyr) (60), also known as glutamate
carboxypeptidase ii his475tyr, is involved in the conversion of dietary folate (polyglutamate) to folate (monoglutamate). 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg131xxx  leu254pro, rs3796191;  xxxg131xxx  asp793gly rs1127717;  xxxg131xxx  ile812val, rs4646750) converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl
thf), a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate. cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2068xxx  leu474phe, rs1979277) catalyzes the
reversible cleavage of serine to form glycine and monocarbonic groups. in addition,  xxxd149xxx  ribonucleotide transformylase (gart val421ile, rs8788; gart
asp752gly rs8971), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (atic cys116ser rs2372536), methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase 1 ( xxxg1473xxx  arg134lys, rs1950902; arg653gln, rs2236225) and methylenetetrahydrofolate synthase (mthfs thr202ala, rs8923) are also
involved in nucleotide synthesis. betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx  arg239gln, rs3733890),  xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx  ile22met,

the risk for advanced and small adenoma was evaluated using polytomous

was modeled as a three-level categorical variable: advanced adenoma, small

haplotypes for genes with multiple snps were imputed using the expectation-maximization method, and ors for haplotypes were calculated using
haplotype trend regression (44), with the most common haplotype serving as
the referent. we also calculated a global chi-square test evaluating the contribution of all haplotypes in a gene as risk factors for colorectal adenoma. we
report d-prime (d#) and r2 measures of linkage disequilibrium between snps
within each gene (45).

results
overall, we found no evidence of departure from hardy–weinberg
equilibrium in controls at the 0.05 level, except for the  xxxg806xxx  tyr75his polymorphism (p 5 0.01, more heterozygotes were observed
than expected). the minor allele frequency for all the snps was at
least 3%. the conditional logistic regression analyses included all 24
snps.
study population characteristics
our study population included 556 colorectal adenoma cases and 557
matched controls from the nhs. the characteristics of the cases and
controls have been described (40). we examined whether the baseline
distributions of known risk factors for colorectal adenoma were similar among these cases and controls who had provided a blood sample
compared with previous observations for the overall nhs cohort
among participants who provided a blood sample. the factors that
differed between cases and controls are similar to those seen in the
whole cohort (8). the risk patterns were similar to those reported for
the entire cohort, though not always statistically significant (table i).
the mean age of cases and their matched controls was 62.3 years.
family history of colorectal cancer, smoking .25 pack-years, body
mass index .30 kg/m2 and consumption of .1 serving of red meat/
day was associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma. in
addition, cases were less probably to be current users of post-menopausal hormones or to take multivitamins and aspirin (,7 aspirin
tablets/week).
among the adenoma cases were 153 proximal adenomas, 254 distal
adenomas, 70 rectal adenomas and 61 individuals with multiple adenomas. endoscopied controls that had a sigmoidoscopy may have had
an undetected proximal adenoma. therefore, we did a subanalysis
restricted to women with adenomas in the distal colon and rectum.
the observed point estimates of the 24 nssnps in the subanalysis did
not differ [point estimates varied ,20%, except for  xxxg262xxx  239 arg/
gln þ gln/gln that had on or 1.28 (95% ci 0.94–1.74)] from the
overall main effects presented in table ii.
this analysis reflects the cumulative consumption of folate prior to
fortification in 1997, since only the last cycle of dietary follow-up was
ascertained after folate fortification. nevertheless we performed a subanalysis of the data stratified by year of adenoma diagnosis (prior to
fortification analysis: adenoma diagnosis in 1995 or earlier; post-fortification analysis: adenoma diagnosis after 1996) and did not find any
salient differences (point estimates varied ,20%) in the association of
the 24 polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma risk (data not shown).

alcohol. the primary analysis of dietary methyl status was based on the
1986 diet instead of the cumulative updated diet, since previous studies suggest
that folate and alcohol act relatively early in the colorectal adenoma-tocarcinoma sequence (2,33,36). the variable dietary methyl status was modeled
as a three-level categorical variable: high, intermediate and low dietary methyl
status. high dietary methyl status was based on energy-adjusted folate and
 xxxd2595xxx  consumption above the median levels among controls (folate:
334.5 mg/day;  xxxd2595xxx : 1.74 g/day), and alcohol intake ,5 g/day. low
dietary methyl status was defined as folate and  xxxd2595xxx  consumption below
the median cut point among controls and alcohol intake 5 g/day. individuals
with neither high nor low methyl status were categorized as having intermediate dietary methyl status. we evaluated departure from multiplicative interaction on the or scale using the p value obtained from the likelihood ratio test
comparing models with and without the interaction term between genotype and
dietary methyl status (as an ordered categorical variable).
we also examined the association of pairwise gene–gene combinations with
risk of colorectal adenoma. we calculated a test for significance of the interaction term to determine whether a snp in a pairwise model was associated
with adenoma. all statistical tests were two sided. all statistical analyses were
performed with sas (version 9.1; sas institute, cary, nc, usa) (4).

overall, we did not observe strong associations for any of the 24 polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic pathway and risk of colorectal adenoma. a borderline increased risk for the transcobalamin
(tcn) ii 259 pro/arg þ arg/arg variants and colorectal adenoma
risk was noted (or 1.33, 95% ci 1.01–1.75) that was slightly stronger
after adjustment for covariates (or 1.48, 95% ci 1.09–2.02). there
was a suggestion of increased risk of colorectal adenoma with the 5aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase
(atic) 116 cys/ser þ ser/ser variant (or 1.30, 95% ci 1.00–
1.70), methylenetetrahydrofolate synthase (mthfs) 202 ala/thr þ
thr/thr variants (or 1.39, 95% ci 0.98–1.98) and the  xxxg1480xxx 
175 leu/leu variant (or 1.59, 95% ci 1.03–2.45).  xxxg806xxx  475 his/
tyr þ tyr/tyr variants had suggestive association with an increased
risk of colorectal adenoma, but this association attenuated after adjustment for the known colorectal adenoma risk factors. the other nssnps
were not significantly associated with modified risk of colorectal adenoma. in table iii, we present a polytomous logistic regression
analysis examining the associations of the 24 snps among cases with
advanced colorectal adenoma and cases with small adenoma compared with controls. the linked  xxxg1480xxx  284 ser/thr þ thr/thr and
 xxxg1480xxx  415 arg/cys þ cys/cys variant carriers were associated with
an increased risk of advanced colorectal adenoma ( xxxg1480xxx  284: or
1.96, 95% ci 1.05–3.67;  xxxg1480xxx  415: or 1.98, 95% ci 1.06–3.56).
estimates of the interaction of dietary methyl status and the genotypes are presented in table iv. among drinkers, baseline average
alcohol consumption was 6.56 g/day for cases and 7.22 g/day for
controls; 38% of women reported no alcohol consumption (table i).
compared with individuals with folate and  xxxd2595xxx  intakes above
the median and ,5 g/week of alcohol consumption, defined as high
methyl status, individuals with intermediate or low methyl status were
associated with a suggestive increased risk for colorectal adenoma,
with an or of 1.36 (95% ci 0.96–1.92). similar point estimates were
obtained in the analysis of methyl status as a three-category variable,
however, to maximize power the results are presented for the collapsed variable combining the intermediate and low categories (data
not shown). generally, we did not find evidence of a departure from
the multiplicative model for the snps and dietary methyl status, except for  xxxg262xxx  arg239gln (test for interaction p 5 0.01), which may
be due to chance.

we also assessed the association between the haplotypes of the
folate hydrolase ( xxxg806xxx ) (d# 5 0.89),  xxxg131xxx  ( xxxg131xxx ), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase
(d# 5 1.0), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase ( xxxg1473xxx )
(d# 5 1.0),  xxxg1475xxx  (d# 5 0.28) and  xxxg1480xxx  (please see supplementary table ii is available at carcinogenesis online) polymorphisms
and the risk of colorectal adenoma (data not shown). there was a suggestion of an association with the  xxxg806xxx  (global test for differences
in risk: v2 5 5.99, df 5 2, p 5 0.05) haplotypes and colorectal adenoma risk. three haplotypes constructed from the 2  xxxg806xxx  snps,
 xxxg806xxx  tyr75his and  xxxg806xxx  his475tyr, were estimated with a frequency 5%. haplotypes that carried the variant alleles were associated with an increased colorectal adenoma risk, with conditional
adjusted ors ranging from 1.19 (95% ci 0.94–1.51) for the 1-0 haplotype to 1.42 (95% ci: 0.92–2.19) for the 0-1 haplotype, compared
with the wild-type haplotypes (0-0).
in addition, we performed exploratory analysis of pairwise gene–
gene combinations to determine whether any two snps in the onecarbon pathway were jointly associated with colorectal adenoma risk
(please see supplementary table iii available at carcinogenesis online for gene–gene interactions with p value ,0.05). slightly higher
than expected by chance, 22 interactions, out of 281 tests performed,
had a p value of ,0.05 (p value calculated using the likelihood ratio
test comparing a model with no genetic effects with a model containing the main effect of each snp and the product term between the
pairwise snps). although six tests had a p value ,0.01, no p values
were statistically significant after the multiple comparisons (46) bonferroni correction (p , 0.0002).

discussion
genes in the one-carbon metabolic pathway may modulate risk of
colorectal adenoma by influencing methyl group availability for
dna methylation reactions or nucleotide synthesis (4,22,27,35,47).
a recent study showed that 60% of colorectal adenomas are abnormally methylated on at least one locus. furthermore, cpg island
methylation phenotype has been demonstrated in large colorectal adenomas and in adenomas with tubular or villous histology (24,25).

we examined the relationship of 24 nssnps in 13 genes in the onecarbon metabolic pathway and risk of colorectal adenoma. the numerous statistical tests we performed may be interpreted as hypothesis
generating, since these snps have not been collectively examined for
adenoma risk. in summary, most of the 24 nssnps in the one-carbon
metabolic pathway did not significantly alter the risk of colorectal
adenoma in our study. in our study, carrier status for the tcn ii
pro259arg polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of
colorectal adenoma. tcn ii is a transport protein essential for the
cellular uptake of  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  (48).  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  is a critical cofactor
in the remethylation of homocysteine to  xxxd2595xxx  (48,49). the tcn
ii pro259arg (c776g) polymorphism may affect transcobalamin
binding activity and transport of cellular  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx  (50–54) but
further studies are needed to confirm these results (55).
in a study of these 24 nssnps and colorectal cancer in the nhs and
health professionals follow-up study, the b12-related snps were
also significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer (39). in
a previous study of colorectal cancer, the tcn ii pro259arg variants
were not significantly associated with overall risk (among men and
women). however, the tcn ii pro259arg variants may have an inverse relationship with colorectal cancer among women (or 0.70,
95% ci 0.49–1.00) (39). in summary, the tcn ii pro259arg variants
were not significantly associated with advanced colorectal adenoma
or cancer, but were associated with overall colorectal adenoma risk in
this study. although this finding may be due to chance, this result
suggests that tcn ii pro259arg may be relevant to early adenoma
development. this previous study also observed an association with
the variant carrier genotypes of  xxxg1480xxx  ser284thr (or 1.85, 95% ci
1.05–3.27) and  xxxg1480xxx  arg415cys (or 2.03, 95% ci 1.14–3.56) with
an increased risk of colorectal cancer (39). in our study, the linked
 xxxg1480xxx  ser284thr and  xxxg1480xxx  arg415cys variant carriers were associated with a 2-fold increased risk for advanced colorectal adenoma.
these results suggest that b12-related genes,  xxxd2595xxx  synthesis
and dna methylation might be important in the colon adenoma-tocarcinoma sequence.
we also examined the influence of common haplotypes in the
 xxxg806xxx ,  xxxg131xxx ,  xxxg1473xxx ,  xxxg1475xxx  and  xxxg1480xxx  genes on risk of colorectal adenoma. the analysis provides additional information about
the susceptibility to colorectal adenoma associated with variants in
 xxxg806xxx  (global test p 5 0.05). however, haplotype analysis did not
reveal any additional information about susceptibility to colorectal
adenoma in relation to the  xxxg131xxx ,  xxxg1473xxx ,  xxxg1475xxx  and  xxxg1480xxx 
snps.

 xxxg1475xxx  reduces 5,10-methylenethf to 5-methylthf, required for
the production of  xxxd2595xxx  and s- xxxd3156xxx , the methyl
donor for dna. a decrease in  xxxg1475xxx  activity associated with the
222 val/val variant may lead to an elevation in 5,10-methylenethf,
required for dna synthesis. the relationship of the  xxxg1475xxx 
ala222val polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma
has been studied (27,33,36,39,49,56,57). a meta-analysis of seven
colorectal adenoma studies did not find a significant association with
the  xxxg1475xxx  ala222val snp (37). however, when folate status is
low, the  xxxg1475xxx  val/val variant is associated with an increase in
homocysteine concentration and dna hypomethylation (18). alcohol
consumption may alter the folate pool toward serine, impeding the
function of  xxxg1480xxx  and  xxxg1475xxx  (11,12). hence, studies have shown
that the risk associated of the  xxxg1475xxx  222 val/val variant is more
evident in the presence of a low-methyl diet (39) that is mostly driven
by high alcohol consumption at levels of 30 g/day (36). however, an
analysis of relation of dietary methyl status and the  xxxg1475xxx  snps
with risk of colorectal adenoma, in this study among women, was not
consistent with findings among men in the health professionals follow-up study (36). the modest consumption of alcohol, the main
component of the dietary methyl status, coupled with the high mean
intake of dietary folate at baseline (higher than the recommended
intake of 400 lg/day) in our study population may partially explain
the null findings.
the selection of controls from a defined cohort of women who had
given a blood sample in the nhs reduces the risk of selection bias.
however, there are several limitations to this study. although these 24
nssnps were chosen with prior biological relevance, there is a concern
of multiple testing. furthermore, these findings are limited by the
incomplete functional characterization of several of these nssnps.
therefore, the suggestive associations of the 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and mthfs snps warrant further investigation. at this time, we do not have plasma b12
levels for all the study participants and therefore were unable to
evaluate interactions with the b12-related genes in this study. the
us food and drug administration mandated the fortification of
grain products with  xxxd2146xxx  in 1996 (58), but the adenomas in this
study were diagnosed from 1989 to 1998 and thus mostly in the prefortification era.
although our study included 556 cases of colorectal adenoma, we
had limited numbers for analysis of advanced adenoma and interaction analysis with dietary methyl status. the low consumption of
alcohol coupled with high dietary folate intake among the women

in our study population may mask associations between these snps
and dietary methyl status. the results could be different in a population with more heavy alcohol consumption and marginal folate status.
therefore, we may have underestimated the role of reduced methyl
group availability in this pathway. moreover, given the numerous
statistical tests we performed, our positive findings need to be
replicated.
there are limited data on the role of genes, beyond  xxxg1475xxx , in the
one-carbon pathway in the etiology of colorectal adenoma and the
data on women are particularly sparse (9,33,34,37). the findings from
polymorphism phenotyping and sorting intolerant from tolerant did
not support strong functional differences for these snps (39). our
results extend the current knowledge of the genetic variation in the
one-carbon metabolic pathway and risk of colorectal adenoma. the
findings from our prospective examination suggest that these nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic genes have
limited influence on the risk of colorectal adenoma. similar to previous studies, we did not find a significant association between
 xxxg1475xxx  ala222val (9,33,34,37) or  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr) asp919gly (59) polymorphism and risk of colorectal adenoma. we did
observe a main effect of the tcn ii pro259arg polymorphism, suggesting that additional investigation of the biological function of the
tcn ii pro259arg genetic variants may help elucidate the relationship of folate, b12, and alcohol consumption with risk of colorectal
adenoma. studies on adenoma among individuals consuming more
alcohol (i.e. 20 g) and less folate may be more probably to be informative. these results suggest the need for future studies on b12
levels and their association with snps in the one-carbon metabolic
pathway. further investigation of these findings coupled with functional knowledge of these snps will offer insight into the role of the
polymorphisms in the one-carbon metabolic network in the etiology
of colorectal adenoma. although analysis of two-way combinations
of snps did not identify more statistically significant combination
than expected by chance, integrated pathway analysis (9) may afford
us the opportunity to elucidate how genetic variations in multiple
genes collaborate in the etiology of colorectal neoplasia.
