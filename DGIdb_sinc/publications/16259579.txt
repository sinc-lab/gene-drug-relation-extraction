orlistat ( xxxd2792xxx ) is an inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, especially  xxxg1789xxx . it is used as an adjunct to diet and exercise in order to
achieve weight loss in obese individuals (body mass index > 30 kg/m2) or in
overweight individuals (body mass index > 27 kg/m2) with other risk factors
for atherosclerotic vascular disease, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia or
diabetes. short- and long-term studies of up to 4 years duration have shown
the drug to have significant benefits in weight loss, as well as in the reduction in lipids, glucose and haemoglobin a1c, and in time to onset of type 2
diabetes compared with diet alone or placebo groups. the incremental
amount of weight loss that orlistat produces is modest, but sufficient to
result in improvement in obesity comorbidities such as elevated blood pressure, dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia compared with diet and exercise
alone. orlistat should only be prescribed for individuals who are motivated to
adhere to lifestyle modifications, especially dietary fat restriction.

introduction

obesity is a major problem worldwide and is identified by many public health
officials as a major modifiable risk factor for disease, second only to tobacco use.
the world health organization has declared obesity an epidemic and has estimated that > 1 billion adults in the world today are overweight, and ≥ 300 million are obese [101]. the link between obesity and comorbidities such as sleep
apnoea, hypertension, diabetes, lipid disorders and cardiovascular disease is well
known to healthcare workers. most experts recommend treating overweight and
obese patients with a diet containing a reduced amount of fat and calories and
with an increase in physical activity and exercise. behavioural therapy has proven
to be useful in achieving weight loss of 5 – 10% of initial weight [1], which can
have enormous beneficial effects on health [2], but which is uniformly disappointing to patients who seek weight loss [3]. unfortunately, behavioural therapy
delays, but does not prevent, weight regain [4]. because of the epidemic of severe
obesity (especially in the us), bariatric surgery, primarily in the form of rouxen-y gastric bypass, has emerged as a useful treatment that produces sustained
weight loss and carries acceptable risks [5]. however, the procedure is not recommended for people with mild-to-moderate obesity, and is not suitable for all
patients with severe obesity. because behavioural therapy does not prevent weight
regain and bariatric surgery is not appropriate for many patients who are overweight and obese, there has been continued interest in obesity pharmacotherapy
as an adjunct to lifestyle modification.

weight-loss drugs

unfortunately, the treatment of obesity with drugs has a checkered history. a societal contempt for obese individuals [6],
which is ironic when one considers that most adults in the us
and european union are overweight or obese [7,102], may translate into negative attitudes and ‘clinical inertia’ on the part of
physicians concerning all aspects of obesity treatment, including the use of medications [8]. public distrust of medications for
obesity has resulted from adverse effects that have led to the
withdrawal from the market of several agents [9]. two prescription drugs are currently approved by the us fda and by the
european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products
(emea) that have been shown to be effective in producing
modest weight loss: sibutramine and orlistat.

in fat. however, it is more difficult to estimate meal fat content
at other times of the day, and ordinarily patients should not
omit orlistat at those meals. the recommended dose is 120 mg
given in three daily doses, in conjunction with meals. the
manufacturer recommends the dose be given during or up tp
1 h after a meal [103]. some studies demonstrate that clinical
effectiveness is not related to timing with a meal, whereas others
have demonstrated that mixing of orlistat with a liquid phase of
the meal will reduce drug effectiveness [14].
because only a small fraction (0 – 2%) of the drug is eliminated in the urine, there is no need to adjust dosage in
patients with chronic renal failure [104]. there is no evidence
that hepatic excretion or detoxification plays a role in the
metabolism of the systemically absorbed drug in humans.

chemistry
5.1 obesity

orlistat ( xxxd2792xxx ) is known chemically as
(s)-2formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (s)-1-[[(2s,3s)3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]-dodecyl ester. it is an offwhite powder with a molecular weight of 495.7 da. its empirical formula is  xxxd2792xxx . the structural formula is shown
in figure 1. the drug is insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in chloroform, methanol and ethanol. it has no pka
within physiological ph range [103].

pharmacology

the effects of orlistat are based on its inhibition of gastrointestinal lipase, resulting in reduced hydrolysis of dietary triglyceride and decreased absorption of dietary fat. initial dosing
studies by drent [10] showed increasing weight loss as the dose
was increased from 10 to 120 mg t.i.d. the dose-response
curve then flattened with little additional weight loss at doses
in excess of 400 mg per day. evidence shows an ∼ 30% reduction in total fat absorption at the recommended dosage. the
drug is poorly absorbed systemically. a review of five doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase ii/iii studies found that
plasma levels of orlistat or its active metabolites were consistent with minimal absorption, indicating that orlistat is
unlikely to cause systemic lipase inhibition [11]. other studies
demonstrate that > 95% of a single dose is recovered from faeces, and only 1 – 2% of the dose is recovered in urine, primarily as inactive metabolites [12]. a study performed on
24 normal-weight, healthy male volunteers concluded that
orlistat has no significant effect on plasma lipase activity [13].
orlistat is intended to be given as an adjunct to a balanced
(< 30% of calories as fat), reduced calorie diet and increased
physical activity. because its main action is inhibition of fat
absorption, it can be omitted if a meal is skipped or contains no
fat. in the authors’ experience with patients in the midwestern
us, it is practical and reasonable to omit orlistat when breakfast
is essentially fat-free. many patients who do best taking orlistat
consume such a breakfast as part of a diet that is generally low
2484

orlistat is approved by the fda and the emea for treatment
of obesity. at least 10 studies of 1 – 2 years duration have
been published on the efficacy of orlistat in inducing and
maintaining weight loss in excess of that achieved by diet and
exercise alone [15]. these were all double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre studies. results were similar in each of
the studies. most weight loss studies, including those reviewed
here, have relatively high dropout rates, in part because of
their long duration. this can introduce bias in study results.
to minimise such bias, intent-to-treat analysis is generally
used. the largest single study was published by davidson
et al. in 1999 [16]. this was a 2-year study from 18 us
research centres. a total of 1187 subjects with a body mass
index (bmi) of 30 – 43 kg/m2 were initially enrolled. after
1-week lead-in on placebo and a reduced calorie diet,
892 subjects were randomised to placebo or orlistat. the
remaining individuals were dropped from the study because
of compliance of < 75% based on pill counts. in total, 11 subjects from the randomised group of 892 withdrew without
any follow-up observations. the results from the remaining
880 subjects were subjected to an intent-to-treat analysis. all
subjects continued a weight reduction diet for 1 year. at the
end of 1 year, 576 subjects entered the second phase of the
study. these subjects were randomised a second time to placebo or orlistat. this phase had two active treatment arms:
one with a total daily dose of 180 mg (3 × 60 mg) and the
second with a total daily dose of 360 mg (3 × 120 mg). all
three groups were placed on a weight maintenance diet. a
total of 403 subjects completed the study. statistical analysis
showed that orlistat-treated subjects lost more weight during
year 1 than the placebo-treated group (8.76 versus 5.81 kg,
p < 0.001). further analysis showed that more subjects treated
with orlistat lost > 5% of their initial weight than placebotreated subjects (65.7 versus 43.6%, p < 0.01). analysis at the
end of the second year showed less weight regain in the group
treated with orlistat 360 mg/day compared with both the
lower dose orlistat and placebo-treated groups (3.2 versus

risk for coronary heart disease showed significant change in
multiple risk factors for every one kilogram of weight that is
lost. large epidemiological studies have reported significant
reductions in mortality among people who reported modest
amounts of intentional weight loss, both nondiabetic
individuals [24] and those with diabetes [25].
it is of interest to consider whether the benefits seen with
orlistat are solely due to weight reduction or whether the
medication has beneficial effects independent of weight
reduction. this question has been addressed in multiple studies. orlistat may be helpful in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia and diabetes, and for reduction of cardiovascular risk
factors. another potential use for orlistat is suggested by a
recent study by jayagopal et al. [26] in women with polycystic
ovary syndrome, which found that orlistat had a similar effect
to metformin in reduction of total testosterone.

respectively, p < 0.001). in the orlistat group, 39.8% had lost
> 10% of initial weight compared with 24.8% in the placebo
group (p = 0.004). it is noteworthy that orlistat is also effective
in preventing weight regain when given to individuals who have
already lost weight with lifestyle modification [17].
there is a misperception among many physicians and
patients that the gastrointestinal side effects of orlistat make
the drug impractical for clinical use. although withdrawal
rates in long-term weight reduction studies tend to be high,
clinical trials of the use of orlistat consistently show lower
withdrawal rates in subjects taking orlistat compared with
subjects taking placebo. in the davidson study [16], the dropout rate was 34% after 1 year and 55% after 2 years. however,
the completion rates and the reasons for dropping out were
not different between the two groups. in the 4-year xenical
in the prevention of diabetes in obese subjects (xendos)
study by torgerson et al. [18], there were fewer dropouts from
the orlistat group than the placebo group (48 versus 66%,
respectively, p < 0.0001). similar findings have been reported
in other studies [19,20,21]. the authors speculate that, in properly selected patients who receive counselling on potential side
effects and the need to avoid excess dietary fat, the efficacy of
orlistat encourages its continued long-term use.
whereas many people desire weight loss for reasons related
to body image, the challenge for healthcare providers has been
to achieve and sustain adequate weight loss to reduce the risk
of important disease states that are associated with excess
weight. a report from the food and nutrition board of the
institute of medicine states, ‘obese individuals who lose even
relatively small amounts of weight are likely to decrease their
blood pressure (and thereby the risk of hypertension), reduce
abnormally high levels of blood glucose (associated with diabetes), bring blood concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides (associated with cardiovascular disease) down to more
desirable levels, reduce sleep apnoea, decrease their risk of
osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints and depression, and
increase self-esteem’ [22]. a review by anderson and konz [23]
that examined the relationship between weight change and

dyslipidaemia
several studies have been conducted that indicate a favourable effect of orlistat on lipids. other studies have been specifically designed to examine the question of whether
orlistat-assisted weight loss has lipid lowering effects beyond
what would be expected by weight loss alone. these include
studies of a single dose effect [27] and studies of 8 weeks [28],
24 weeks [29] and 1-year duration [30]. the largest study, by
lucas et al. [31], reported results in 444 patients receiving
orlistat or placebo for 1 year. all patients had either hypercholesterolaemia or combined hyperlipidaemia. all subjects
were placed on a weight reduction diet and randomised to
placebo or orlistat 360 mg/day. study results showed a significant difference (p < 0.0001) between orlistat and placebo
in weight reduction in both subjects with hypercholesterolaemia alone (-11.2 versus -5.7 kg) and in those with combined hyperlipidaemia (-10.1 versus -4.8 kg). similar
reductions were observed in low-density lipoprotein (ldl)cholesterol, total cholesterol and ldl/high-density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol ratio. there was no significant difference between orlistat and placebo for triglyceride
reduction or rise in hdl-cholesterol. in contrast, an analysis by zavoral [32] of pooled data from five randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of orlistat in conjunction
with a hypocaloric diet showed significant reduction of triglycerides in the subjects taking orlistat compared with those
on a hypocaloric diet and placebo. a 1-year study of type 2
diabetic subjects on sulfonylurea monotherapy, randomised
to orlistat 360 mg/day or placebo, demonstrated a reduction
in serum triglyceride concentrations that was 0.2 mmol/l
greater in subjects taking orlistat than those on placebo
(p < 0.05) [20]. a recent meta-analysis of 28 randomised,
controlled trials by hutton and fergusson [33] concluded
that orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. is effective at improving both
weight loss and serum lipids in obese individuals.
other studies have been performed to specifically examine
the effects of orlistat on serum cholesterol levels. studies by
muls [34] (294 subjects over 24 weeks) and derosa [35]
5.2

2485

orlistat

(99 subjects over 52 weeks) both showed significant total
cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol reductions in subjects taking
orlistat compared with placebo. the conclusion in the study
by muls was that there was additional benefit from orlistat on
cholesterol levels beyond its effect on body weight. this conclusion is supported by a single dose study by tan, which
demonstrated improvement of plasma triglycerides, cholesterol in remnant-like particles and free  xxxd2154xxx  in the early
postprandial period in overweight, type 2 diabetic individuals. the study by micic et al. [29] of 448 patients randomised
to placebo or orlistat for 24 weeks found that for comparable
degrees of weight loss, there was a greater decline in total cholesterol in the orlistat group compared with placebo. the
results of several other large clinical trials [16,20,36] support this
finding. an independent effect of orlistat on cholesterol
absorption has been confirmed in a study using a dual
isotopic tracer method, demonstrating a 25% reduction in
cholesterol absorption after 3 days of orlistat treatment [37].
diabetes treatment and prevention
type 2 diabetes mellitus is an obesity-related disease that
causes excess morbidity and mortality, primarily from cardiovascular complications [38]. modest weight loss is associated
with a reduction in cardiovascular death among people with
diabetes [25]. the uk prospective diabetes study (ukpds)
demonstrated that improvement in control of hyperglycaemia, produced by insulin and sulfonylurea therapy, resulted in
a ∼ 16% reduction in myocardial infarction that approached,
but did not reach, statistical significance [39]. in contrast, the
use of metformin, which promotes weight loss and minimises
weight gain, was associated with a 40% reduction in myocardial infarction [40]. acarbose, another agent that produces
modest weight loss or limits weight gain, has been reported to
reduce cardiovascular events by ∼ 50% in a large prospective
study [41]. orlistat is approved as a weight loss agent and has
been extensively evaluated as a possible treatment for diabetes
and for its ability to prevent diabetes [18].
hollander et al. [20] performed a multi-centre 57-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 391 obese
men and women with type 2 diabetes on sulfonylurea monotherapy. as in other clinical trials with orlistat, all participants
were encouraged to adhere to a low fat, weight reduction diet.
there was significantly greater weight loss in the orlistat
group compared with placebo, and also significantly greater
reductions in haemoglobin a1c and fasting glucose values.
other investigators have studied the use of orlistat in people
receiving different forms of pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes. kelley et al. [21] reported improved glycemic control
and reduction in insulin requirements when orlistat was
added to insulin monotherapy in type 2 diabetic subjects. a
study by miles et al. [19] showed similar results in metformintreated patients. the effect of orlistat plus diet compared with
placebo plus diet on body weight and fasting plasma glucose
in this study is shown in figure 2. this study also showed
improvement in blood pressure in the orlistat group. several
5.3

2486

meta-analyses have concluded that orlistat is effective in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes in obese patients [42-44].
a second group of studies has examined the effects of
orlistat in obese subjects who are at risk for developing type 2
diabetes. relatively little information is available concerning
the effect of orlistat on insulin sensitivity. kelley et al. [45] randomised 39 subjects with type 2 diabetes to orlistat or placebo. weight loss was slightly, but not significantly, greater in
the orlistat group. the decrease in haemoglobin a1c was not
different between the groups (∆ = -0.97 versus -1.65%,
p = 0.15), perhaps due to the small sample size. the improvement in insulin sensitivity and lowering of plasma free fatty
acids was greater in the orlistat group than in the placebo
group. a study by heymsfield et al. [46] analysed pooled data
from three studies according to glucose status (normal,
impaired or diabetic). changes in glucose status from the time
of enrollment to the end of the study were measured. the use
of orlistat in conjunction with diet significantly improved
impaired glucose tolerance (igt) and reduced rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance (ngt) to igt and
from igt to type 2 diabetes. the largest study to address
the topic of diabetes prevention is the xendos study [18].
this 4-year placebo-controlled, double-blind prospective
study involved 3305 people randomised to lifestyle change
plus placebo or lifestyle change plus orlistat. at the conclusion of the study, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was
6.2% with orlistat compared with 9.0% with placebo, representing a 37.3% relative risk reduction (p < 0.0032). the
authors concluded on further data analysis that the difference was mainly due to preventative effects of weight loss in
those with igt, because weight loss was similar in both
those with igt and those with ngt, but the progression to
diabetes in those with ngt at baseline was low (cumulative
incidence of only 2.7% over 4 years).
control of other cardiovascular risk factors
in addition to diabetes and hyperlipidaemia, there are other factors associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, including hypertension. a meta-analysis by sharma and golay [47] of
studies that included subjects with inadequately controlled
blood pressure concluded that improvement in blood pressure
and heart rate associated with orlistat therapy was primarily due
to weight loss and, therefore, orlistat may play a role in the
management of hypertension in overweight and obese patients.
orlistat has been shown to improve the constellation of
risk factors for atherosclerosis known as metabolic syndrome. the metabolic syndrome is a hyperinsulinemic
state associated with abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia and
hypertension. a recently published open-label, multi-centre, randomised controlled study of type 2 diabetic individuals with metabolic syndrome compared 94 subjects on
a hypocaloric diet plus orlistat with 34 subjects on a hypocaloric diet alone [48]. analysis of results after 6 months of
treatment showed statistically significant improvement in
weight, waist circumference, fasting glucose, systolic blood

with the diet alone group. the ukpds risk engine [105] was
used to assess changes in risk of fatal or nonfatal heart disease or stroke over the next 10 years. there was a significant difference in risk reduction between the two groups
(-50% in the orlistat group versus -4.5% in the diet alone
group, p < 0.0001).
combination therapy
relatively few studies that investigate the use of orlistat in
combination with other weight loss agents are available. wadden et al. [49] randomised 34 women who had lost weight
while taking sibutramine to sibutramine plus orlistat or sibutramine plus placebo for 4 months. the addition of orlistat to
sibutramine did not induce further weight loss.

safety and tolerability

orlistat currently has fda approval only as a treatment for obesity in adults and in pediatric patients > 12 years of age [106]. the
emea has approved orlistat for use in obese adults
(bmi ≥ 30 kg/m2) and for overweight adults (bmi > 28 kg/m²)
with associated risk factors. the emea states that orlistat is not
intended for use in children [107].
there is good evidence of the effectiveness of orlistat.
orlistat has been advocated for use in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia. at present, it does not have
fda or emea approval for these indications, although the
package insert does include information on these topics.
contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug,
chronic malabsorption syndromes and cholestasis [103].

orlistat

orlistat should be used cautiously in patients with gastrointestinal disease, especially if accompanied by chronic
diarrhoea, in patients with known (or with risk factors for)
fat soluble vitamin deficiencies [104], and in individuals
with hyperoxaluria or oxalate stones [50]. although it is well
known that rapid weight loss is associated with the formation of gall stones, the risk of using the drug in patients
with existing gallstones or at risk for gallstones remains
unknown, as studies have been contradictory concerning
the effect of orlistat on the biliary system [51,52]. the main
side effects of orlistat are gastrointestinal. symptoms
include bloating, oily stools, flatulence, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and faecal soiling [108]. these symptoms can be
minimised by avoiding excess dietary fat and the use of
psyllium [53]. studies of bone turnover have not shown any
adverse effects [54,55]. there are no known carcinogenic
effects. safety in pregnancy is  xxxd3237xxx  (fda pregnancy class b) [106]. there are no published data establishing safety of orlistat in children < 12 years of age. studies in
adolescents 12 – 16 years of age have demonstrated safety and
effectiveness of the drug comparable with adults [56,106].
multiple studies have been performed on the interaction
of orlistat with other drugs that patients with obesity might
also be taking. the main potential drug interaction, identified in several reports, is inhibition of absorption of
cyclosporin [57-60]. whether this is a true drug–drug interaction or a result of orlistat’s mechanism of action has not
been determined. it is recommended that transplant
patients who are taking orlistat have regular monitoring of
cyclosporin blood levels. orlistat has also been
demonstrated to reduce the absorption of several fat soluble nutrients, including beta-carotene [61], vitamin d [62]
and  xxxd3521xxx  [63]. because of this, routine supplementation with a multiple vitamin is recommended for individuals taking orlistat. although not well documented, there is
a theoretical concern that inhibition of  xxxd3522xxx 
absorption could result in altered international normalized
ratio (inr) values during warfarin therapy [64,65]. it is
advisable to follow the inr closely in any patient who is
taking warfarin when orlistat therapy is initiated or discontinued. multiple studies of other drugs, including sulfonylureas [66], statins [67], digitalis [68], anticonvulsants [69] and
oral contraceptives [70], show no interactions with any of
these drugs.

conclusions

orlistat is a unique medication that inhibits gastrointestinal
lipases and results in an ∼ 30% reduction in fat absorption. this
effect contributes to a more substantial weight loss than can be
achieved by diet and exercise alone. in addition, the medication
can help to maintain weight reduction over periods ≤ 4 years [18].
the medication is generally well-tolerated in patients who are
successful in adhering to a low fat diet, generally ≤ 30% of total
calories. although the drug has fda approval only for weight
reduction, it may be useful as an adjunct in the management of
patients with hyperlipidaemia, igt or type 2 diabetes. orlistat
has also been shown to reduce progression to diabetes in individuals with igt. it may have independent effects on cholesterol
and other lipid fractions, but the main benefit of the drug derives
from augmented weight loss over diet and lifestyle change alone.
lifestyle modification should always be attempted before undertaking pharmacotherapy for weight loss. for individuals who fail
with lifestyle efforts, however, orlistat is a consideration in view
of its excellent safety profile. in those patients who are at
increased risk for cardiovascular disease, orlistat has favourable
effects on surrogate markers such as lipids, blood pressure and
glucose. long-term (5- to 10-year) studies are needed to
determine whether it produces improvements in mortality.
8.

expert opinion

orlistat is an agent that is substantially safe, in contrast to some
earlier weight reduction medications. the magnitude of the
weight loss that it produces is modest, but clinically meaningful,
and sufficient to have favourable effects on health. in particular,
it may be useful as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy of dyslipidaemia and diabetes in selected patients. it should not be prescribed
casually or without a full discussion of the essentiality of lifestyle
modification. many individuals are not prepared to make a commitment to improved eating habits, and indiscriminate prescribing of orlistat for such patients, although not dangerous, will
often produce intolerable gastrointestinal side effects and treatment failure. on the other hand, if orlistat is prescribed selectively to motivated people, the results can be quite rewarding.
new weight loss medications are under development, and the
possibility of synergy among new agents and established agents
such as orlistat may lead to multiple drug therapy for the
management of obesity and its complications.
