abstract endothelins are a family of potent endogenous
mediators that have been implicated in a number of airway and other diseases. recently, the non-peptide mixed
eta/etb endothelin receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx  has
been successfully tested in the treatment of cardiovascular
diseases. it was the aim of the present study to characterize the effects of  xxxd358xxx  on the pulmonary actions of  xxxg674xxx  (et-1),  xxxg675xxx  ( xxxg675xxx ) and the etb-receptor agonist irl1620 in the isolated perfused and ventilated rat lung (ipl) and in precision-cut lung slices
(pcls).
in the ipl,  xxxd358xxx  completely prevented the
irl1620-induced vasoconstriction (ic50 3 µm). the inhibition by  xxxd358xxx  of et-1-elicited vasoconstriction
showed a biphasic course, reflecting the inhibition of etaand etb-mediated vasoconstriction (ic50 0.2 µm and
19 µm, respectively). in addition,  xxxd358xxx  prevented the
et-1- (ic50 6 µm) and irl1620-induced (ic50 3 µm)
prostacyclin release.  xxxd358xxx  also completely prevented
the bronchoconstriction induced by irl1620 in the ipl
(ic50 20 µm) and in pcls (ic50 13 µm). in pcls, the
pd2-values were et-1 7.20±0.23,  xxxg675xxx  7.51±0.27 and
irl1620 7.33±0.29.  xxxd358xxx  at 100 µm caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve of et-1,
 xxxg675xxx  and irl1620 by a factor of 5, 46 and 64, respectively. in all cases the slope of the schild regression was
lower than unity, disregarding a simple interaction of
 xxxd358xxx  with one receptor. with respect to et-1-induced
bronchoconstriction, in the ipl  xxxd358xxx  in concentrations of up to 10 µm aggravated et-1-induced bronchoconstriction probably due to the blockade of bronchodilatory eta-receptors (ic50 0.3 µm) and even at 100 µm
showed only very little protection from et-1-induced
bronchoconstriction in the ipl and in the pcls.

the similar ic50-values for et-1-induced vasoconstriction and bronchodilation suggest that only one type of
eta-receptor is involved. the differing ic50-values between irl1620-induced bronchoconstriction and prostacyclin release, the slope of the schild regression and the
failure of  xxxd358xxx  to prevent the et-1-induced bronchoconstriction suggest a complex interaction between
the known et-receptors or the existence of unknown etbreceptor subtypes.

introduction
endothelins (et) are a family of peptides with strong direct and indirect effects on smooth muscle tone. et levels
are increased in pulmonary or cardiovascular disorders
such as asthma, hypertension or stroke. therefore, in
these and other therapies endothelin antagonists may provide a new therapeutic approach. recently, the orally active endothelin receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx  has given
promising results in patients with chronic heart disease
suffering from pulmonary and systemic hypertension and
also in patients with essential hypertension (krum et al.
1998; sütsch et al. 1998; webb and strachan 1998).
in the lung, et-1 causes both broncho- and vasoconstriction (uhlig et al. 1995). both effects are mediated by
eta- and etb-receptors and full blockade of both receptors is necessary for nearly complete protection from
et-1-induced pressor responses in the perfused rat lung
(uhlig and featherstone 1997). to further investigate
these complex interactions here we used the mixed
eta/etb-receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx . it is about tenfold
more effective on eta-receptors than on etb-receptors
(clozel et al. 1994). previously, takahashi et al. (1997)
studied  xxxd358xxx  in human bronchial rings, but did not investigate pulmonary vascular responses or prostacyclin
release. however, due to the multiple effects of endothe-

129

lins and in view of the possible interactions between airway and vascular responses, a simultaneous analysis of
these responses may provide further information. such an
approach is possible in perfused rat lungs (uhlig et al.
1995). however, in our previous study we used only one
single concentration of  xxxd358xxx , while in view of the interactions of endothelin receptors in the lung concentration-response curves may give further insight into the
complex pharmacology of endothelin receptors. moreover, in view of the use of  xxxd358xxx  in clinical studies a
detailed analysis of the effects of  xxxd358xxx  on endothelininduced alterations in lung functions is deserved.
another goal of this study was to establish the usage of
precision-cut lung slices for studies in pulmonary pharmacology. precision-cut lung slices represent a novel model
to study lung functions (martin et al. 1996; cowley and
eidelman 1998; martin and uhlig 2000). in this model,
viable lung slices of 220 µm thickness are placed under a
microscope and the contraction of airways and vessels,
which is visible directly, is quantified by video imaging.
so far this model has been used to study the activity of agonists such as  xxxd2586xxx  on rat (martin et al. 1996)
and murine airways (held et al. 1999). however, as yet
this model has not been used in pharmacological testing.
here, we investigated the potency of  xxxd358xxx  to inhibit the broncho- and vasoconstriction as well as prostacyclin release following activation of either only etb-receptors by irl1620 or  xxxg675xxx , or following unspecific activation by et-1 in the perfused rat lung and in precisioncut lung slices.

materials and methods
materials. female wistar rats (210–240 g; zentralinstitut hannover, germany) were used as lung donors. pentobarbital sodium
(nembutal) was purchased from the wirtschaftsgenossenschaft
deutscher tierärzte (hannover, germany), bovine albumin (fraction 11930/05110) from serva (heidelberg, germany). et-1
(boehringer mannheim, germany) was dissolved in 10 µl of 1%
acetate and further diluted with h2o.  xxxg675xxx  was from snpe
(frankfurt, germany), irl1620 (suc-[glu9,ala11,15]-endothelin1-(8–21) from peninsula (belmont, usa).  xxxd358xxx  (4-tert-butyln-[6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2’-bipyriidin-4yl]-benzenesulfonamide was a kind gift from m. clozel (hoffmann-la roche, basel, switzerland).  xxxg675xxx , irl1620 and  xxxd358xxx  were dissolved in h2o.
isolated perfused rat lung preparation. the rat lungs were prepared and perfused essentially as described recently (uhlig and
wollin 1994; uhlig 1998). briefly, lungs were perfused at constant
hydrostatic pressure (12 cmh2o) through the pulmonary artery,
which resulted in a flow rate of about 30 ml/min. as a perfusion
medium we used krebs-henseleit buffer (37°c) that contained 2%
albumin, 0.1% glucose and 0.3% hepes. the total amount of recirculating buffer was 100 ml. the lungs were suspended by the
trachea and were ventilated by negative pressure ventilation with
80 breaths/min and a tidal volume between 1.95 ml and 2.05 ml.
every 5 min a hyperinflation (–16 cmh2o) was performed. artificial thorax chamber pressure was measured with a differential
pressure transducer (validyne dp 45-14), and airflow velocity
with a pneumotachograph tube connected to a differential pressure
transducer (validyne dp 45-15). the lungs respired humidified
air. the perfusate flow (q) as well as the arterial (part) and venous
pressure (pven) were continuously monitored. the ph of the per-

fusate before entering the lung was kept  xxxd2274xxx .3 by constant bubbling of the buffer with carbogen. all data were transmitted to a
computer via an analog pulmonary-mechanics analyser (buxco
electronics, sharon, usa) which calculated pulmonary resistance,
pulmonary compliance and tidal volume. vascular resistance was
calculated under ls-12 (buxco electronics, sharon, usa) on the
computer. simultaneously, chamber pressure, airflow velocity,
tidal volume, dynamic compliance, airway resistance and perfusate
flow rate were recorded on a graphtec linearrecorder wr3500.
for lung mechanics the data were analyzed by applying the following formula:
p=

gl dt

where p is the chamber pressure, c the pulmonary compliance, v
the tidal volume and gl the pulmonary conductance. vascular
conductance (gv) was calculated as
gv =

experimental design. to obtain a stable baseline, all lungs were
perfused for 40 min before 10 nm et-1,  xxxg675xxx  or irl1620 were injected into the pulmonary artery.  xxxd358xxx  was added 10 min before administration of et-1. within these 10 min no concentration
of  xxxd358xxx  induced any alterations in lung function. after administration of et-1,  xxxg675xxx  or irl1620, the lungs were perfused and
ventilated for another 110 min, unless breakdown of breathing
happened.
precision-cut lung slices. lung slices were prepared essentially as
described before (martin et al. 1996). the lungs were perfused
with hank’s solution through the pulmonary artery until they were
free of blood. the heart and the lungs were removed en bloc and
the lungs were filled through the trachea with 10 ml agarose solution (0.75% in mem, 44 ml/kg) and a bolus of 1 ml air. for instillation and incubation mem supplemented with sodium pyruvate,
amino acids, vitamins and hepes was used. after cooling of the
agarose to 4°c, tissue cores were prepared by advancing a rotating
sharpened metal tube (diameter 8 mm). from these cores tissue
slices (220±20 µm) were prepared by using a krumdieck tissue
slicer (alabama research and development, munford, ala.,
usa). lung slices were floated on teflon mesh and cultured in
glass vials containing 1 ml mem. the vials were placed on a roller
system housed in a humidified incubator. they were incubated at
37°c in a humid atmosphere and rotated  xxxd1891xxx  rpm. lung slices
were incubated in mem medium lacking phenol red, since it was
recently reported that phenol red may block the thromboxane receptor (greenberg et al. 1994).
image acquisition. the incubation chamber (martin et al. 1996)
was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (leica dmirb;
benzheim, germany) and warmed to 37°c. the slices were transferred to this chamber. the airways were focused and imaged with
a digital video camera (visicam 640; visitron systems, munich,
germany). after pre-incubation for 10 min with 1 ml mem the
first image was acquired. the airway area obtained from this first
image served as the reference area (100%). the liquid was removed and irl1620 or  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) diluted in 1 ml medium was transferred into the incubation cell. the airway was imaged every minute during the incubation time of 10 min. the concentrations were varied from 10–10 m to 10–6 m.
image analysis. the images were analysed by an image analysis
program (optimas 6.1; optimas, bothell, wash., usa). the luminal area was taken as the area enclosed by the epithelial luminal
border and was quantified after setting the appropriate threshold
value. control airway area was defined as 100%.
measurement of prostacyclin. samples taken from the perfusate of
ventilated lungs were stored at –20°c. prostacyclin was assessed
as the stable by-product 6-keto-pgf1alpha by eia (cayman). the cross-

130
reactivity of the detecting antibody was 6-keto-pgf1alpha, 100%; 2,3dinor-6-keto-pgf1alpha, 8.7%; pgf2alpha, 2.1%; pge2, 0.92%; pgf1alpha,
0.8%, other prostaglandins ≤0.1%.
statistics. data in the figures from perfused lung experiments are
given as means ± sem, data in the text and in figures from experiments with the pcls as means ± sd. using graphpad prism
(graphpad software; san diego, calif., usa) concentration-response-curves were calculated from the area under the curve
(auc) in the case of airway conductance, airway contraction in
the slices and prostacyclin release, or from the value 30 min after
administration of the agonist in case of vascular conductance. if
curves were analysed as the sum of two sigmoidal dose-response
curves, these functions were entered as user-defined equations in
the prism program. subsequently, by f-test we compared the
model consisting of the sum of two sigmoidal curves to the model
with a single sigmoidal curve. p<0.05 was always considered significant.
to calculate the pkb-values from the rightward shifts, the data
were analysed by schild regression and subsequently it was tested
by f-test whether the regression had a slope of 1. individual pkbvalues at a single agonist concentration were determined by the
formula kb=[bos]/(a’/a-1), where a’ and a are the ec50-values in
the presence and absence of  xxxd358xxx , respectively.

results
perfused lung
irl1620
in the perfused rat lung (ipl), specific activation of etbreceptors by perfusion with 10 nm irl1620 caused
rapidly decreasing airway conductance, which resulted in
a collapse of breathing after 15 min (fig. 1a). simultaneously, irl1620 evoked comparatively less pronounced
vasoconstriction, resulting in a decrease in vascular conductance of about 50% after 30 min (fig. 1b; note the different scales). at 100 µm  xxxd358xxx , full protection from
irl1620-evoked lung damage was achieved (fig. 1).
 xxxd358xxx  also reduced the irl1620-induced prostacyclin
release (fig. 1c). the corresponding ic50-values are shown
in fig. 2 and table 1.
et-1
et-1 (10 nm) caused slowly precipitating broncho- and
vasoconstriction (fig. 3). in the presence of et-1 the response pattern to  xxxd358xxx  was more complex than with
irl1620. in concentrations up to 10 µm,  xxxd358xxx  concentration-dependently increased et-1-elicited bronchoconstriction, resulting in a sudden decrease of airway conductance  xxxd1891xxx  µm  xxxd358xxx , a response similar to that of
specific activation of etb-receptors with irl1620 (fig.
3a). only at high concentrations, i.e. 100 µm,  xxxd358xxx 
showed a small protection against the et-1-induced bronchoconstriction.  xxxd358xxx  prevented both et-1-induced
vasoconstriction (fig. 3b) and prostacyclin release (fig.
3c).
the further analysis of the effects of  xxxd358xxx  on et-1induced bronchoconstriction was based on previous findings that activation of eta-receptors mediates bronchodi-

lation and activation of etb-receptors bronchoconstriction. this analysis, which is shown in fig. 4a, resulted in
ic50-values of 0.3 µm for inhibition of eta-mediated
bronchodilation and 50 µm for etb-mediated bronchoconstriction. the et-1-elicited vasoconstriction was
analysed assuming an eta- and etb-selective component
of  xxxd358xxx . the resulting ic50-values were 0.1 µm and
16 µm, respectively (fig. 4b). since the etb-receptor ag-

131

onist irl1620 induced about the same amount of prostacyclin as did et-1, we assumed that the prostacyclin release occurs by activation of etb-receptors (fig. 4c).
precision-cut lung slices

fig. 2a–c concentration-response curves of the irl1620-elicited
responses shown in fig. 1. evaluated were a for the bronchoconstriction the auc data, b for the vasoconstriction the normalised
vascular conductance after 30 min and c for the prostacyclin release the auc data

in theory, the differences between the different ic50-values for the etb-mediated bronchoconstriction and the
etb-mediated prostacyclin release in the ipl could have
been caused by the fact that the  xxxd358xxx  concentration
that finally reaches the airways in perfused lungs is – as a
consequence of dilution by diffusion – lower than the one
present in the vessels. to exclude such an artefact, we investigated the effect of  xxxd358xxx  on the airways in precision-cut lung slices, where the concentration of  xxxd358xxx 
around the airways is under full experimental control. to
further clarify the differences in the inhibitory potency of
 xxxd358xxx  for et-1- and irl1620-elicited bronchoconstriction, another etb-agonist, the naturally occurring
 xxxg675xxx  (karaki et al. 1996), was examined in the pcls.
in agreement with our findings in the perfused lungs,
we observed that the response of the slices to et-1 was
slower than that to both irl1620 or  xxxg675xxx  (fig. 5). for instance, after 2 min in the presence of 1 µm of the agonist,
airways were closed to 8.8±4.7% (mean ± sd) and
14.6±12.3% of the initial airway area in irl1620- and
 xxxg675xxx -treated slices, but only to 32.3±8.1% in et-1-treated
slices (fig. 5). in addition, we observed that also in the
slices a small  xxxd358xxx  concentration (10 nm) slightly aggravated the et-1-induced bronchoconstriction (data not
shown).
we next compared the effect of using et-1, irl1620
or  xxxg675xxx  in a single concentration in one slice compared to
cumulative concentration-response curves in the same slice.
the corresponding ec50-values for et-1 were 0.070 µm
(single) vs. 0.058 µm (cumulative), for  xxxg675xxx  0.032 µm
(single) vs. 0.031 µm (cumulative), and for irl1620
0.070 µm (single) vs. 0.034 µm (cumulative), corresponding to mean pd2 ± sd values of 7.20±0.23 (n=7), 7.51±
0.27 (n=9), and 7.33±0.29 (n=7), respectively. these find-

fig. 3 time course of et-1-induced a bronchoconstriction, b
vasoconstriction and c prostacyclin release. lungs were perfused
with 10 nm et-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of
 xxxd358xxx  (0.1–100 µm). bronchoconstriction and vasoconstriction
are shown as a decrease in airway or vascular conductance referred
to the time point of agonist addition. the  xxxd358xxx  concentrations
in c were 100 µm (●), 10 µm (◆),1 µm (▼), 0.1 µm (▲), 0 µm

ings suggested that cumulative response curves were feasible. using cumulative concentration-response curves, we
calculated ic50-values for  xxxd358xxx  of 13, 21 and 25 µm
for 0.1 µm irl1620, et-1 or  xxxg675xxx , respectively (table 1).
finally, we investigated the rightward shift of the concentration-response curves in the presence of  xxxd358xxx 
(fig. 6).  xxxd358xxx  shifted the concentration-response curve

fig. 4a–c concentration-response curves of the et-1-elicited responses shown in fig. 3. evaluated were a for the bronchoconstriction the auc data, b for the vasoconstriction the normalised
vascular conductance after 30 min and c for the prostacyclin release the auc data. the curves in a and b were calculated as the
sum of two sigmoidal dose-response curves assuming an eta(lower ec50) and an etb- (higher ec50) selective component of
 xxxd358xxx . the analysis showed that such a two-stage model explained the data significantly better (p<0.05) than a model with a
single simple sigmoidal curve

of all three agonists to the right. however,  xxxd358xxx  was
much more potent in the case of  xxxg675xxx  and irl1620 than
in the case of et-1. this is also evident from the schild
plot. (fig. 6; lower left panel). the pkb-values that were
calculated assuming a slope of 1 were 4.92±0.15, 5.96±
0.11 and 5.98±0.21, for  xxxg674xxx ,  xxxg675xxx  and irl1620, respectively. however, since the slope in the hill regression was
significantly (f-test p<0.05) different from 1, the data are
not consistent with a model of simple competition and
hence the pkb-values from the schild analysis are diffi-

133

both receptor subtypes also counteract these pressor responses by causing release of no and dilatory prostaglandins (uhlig et al. 1995; lal et al. 1996; clement et al.
1998; emanueli et al. 1998). thus, activation of eta-receptors on presumably airway epithelial cells leads to relaxation of airway smooth muscle, while activation of etbreceptors on endothelial cells results in vascular smooth
muscle relaxation. to further complicate matters, at higher
concentrations or by mutual interaction on smooth muscle
cells, eta-receptors may also contract airway smooth
muscle (inui et al. 1994), while etb-receptors may also
act directly on vascular smooth muscle (ladouceur et al.
1993). due to this complicated response pattern, a detailed
investigation of each endothelin antagonist is required to
fully understand its effects in the lung. in the present
study, such a detailed analysis has been performed for
 xxxd358xxx  in perfused lungs and in precision-cut lung
slices. these experiments resulted in two major observations, which will be discussed below. (1) the ic50-values
of  xxxd358xxx  for interference with etb-receptors range
from 3 µm for irl1620-induced prostacyclin release to
20 (25) µm for irl1620 ( xxxg675xxx )-induced bronchoconstriction, suggesting the existence of different etb-receptor
subtypes. the existence of two etb-receptor subtypes
was also suggested from the pkb-values for the etb-agonists shown in table 2. (2) at a concentration of 100 µm
 xxxd358xxx  antagonised the bronchoconstriction induced by
the etb-receptor agonist irl1620 (takai et al. 1992), but
was nearly ineffective against et-1. in addition, in pcls
the schild regression revealed that the capacity of  xxxd358xxx  to prevent et-1-induced bronchoconstriction was significantly weaker than in the case of  xxxg675xxx  and irl1620.

cult to interpret. therefore, pkb-values were calculated
for each single  xxxd358xxx  concentration (table 2). for the
etb-receptor agonists there appear to be two separate
groups of pkb-values, namely below and above 1 µm
 xxxd358xxx . in addition, the rightward shifts of the dose-response curves caused by  xxxd358xxx  are also shown in table 2.

discussion
the pharmacology of endothelin receptors in the lung is
complex and is characterised by mutual interactions between the two known endothelin receptors. the most evident consequences of eta- and etb-receptor activation in
the lungs are vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction,
respectively (michael and markewitz 1996). however,

in the present study in the pcls the pd2 for et-1 and
irl-1620 was 7.20 and 7.33, respectively, compared to
7.4–7.6 and 7.4–7.7 in human bronchi (takahashi et al.
1997; hay et al. 1998). these data show a good correlation between both models. a similar parallelism in both
models was observed with  xxxd358xxx , where with respect
to the et-1 concentration-response curve 100 µm  xxxd358xxx  caused a 4.9-fold right shift in pcls compared to 3.4
in human bronchial rings (takahashi et al. 1997). with respect to irl1620, the right shifts in the concentration-response curves caused by  xxxd358xxx  were 2.5-fold (1 µm
 xxxd358xxx ), 6.4-fold (10 µm) and 14-fold (33 µm) in pcls
compared to 6.6-fold (1 µm  xxxd358xxx ) and 11.2-fold
(10 µm) in human bronchi (takahashi et al. 1997). in addition, the observations made in the whole perfused organ
were reproduced in the pcls. these findings demonstrate that pcls offer a novel and reproducible model to
study airway responses. the advantage of this method
compared to others is that it allows to study responses in
airways much smaller than bronchi or tracheas. since the
contribution of these comparatively small airways to the
regulation of airway tone under normal or pathological

conditions is unknown, this model offers a unique approach to this problem. for instance, we have previously
shown that small airways are about ten times more sensitive to  xxxd2586xxx  (martin et al. 1996) or the thromboxane-receptor agonist u46619 (martin et al. 2000) than
larger airways, while small and large airways do not differ
in their response to endothelin (data not shown). other advantages of the pcls system include the great number of
slices (20–50) that can be obtained from a single lung, the
longevity of the slices (3 days) and its applicability to almost any species including humans (martin et al., manuscript in preparation).
when comparing the pcls model to that of perfused
lungs, it is interesting to note the fact that the ic50-values
of  xxxd358xxx  for preventing bronchoconstriction are approximately two times lower in the lung slices than in the
perfused lung. this is in line with previous observations
with other agents (held et al. 1999). the most likely ex-

planation for this finding is that agents become diluted on
their way from the vessels to the airways. this explanation is supported by the additional finding in this and
other studies (held et al. 1999) that the ic50-values for the
vascular responses, where the diffusion distance is much
shorter, are usually the same as in the lung slices.
pulmonary pharmacology of  xxxd358xxx 
 xxxd358xxx  is an orally active eta/etb-receptor antagonist.
recently, first clinical trials demonstrated the clinical
benefit of  xxxd358xxx  treatment in patients with hypertension or chronic heart failure (krum et al. 1998; sütsch et
al. 1998; webb and strachan 1998). in addition, anti-endothelin therapy might be considered in other lung diseases where elevated endothelin levels have been reported,
such as asthma (hay et al. 1996) or interstitial lung disease (yamakami et al. 1998).
table 1 summarises the ic50-values of  xxxd358xxx  for the
different responses in perfused rat lungs and pcls. these
ic50-values are consistent with previously published kivalues obtained from binding experiments in that the
affinity to eta-receptors was considerably higher than
that of etb-receptors (clozel et al. 1994). the absolute
values obtained in our lung models were approximately
ten times higher than the reported ki-values from the binding studies (clozel et al. 1994). the different inhibitory
capacity of  xxxd358xxx  for eta- and etb-receptors is reflected by the potentiation of et-1-induced bronchocon-

135

striction at low  xxxd358xxx  concentrations in perfused rat
lungs (fig. 4a) and by the biphasic inhibition by  xxxd358xxx 
of et-1-mediated vasoconstriction (fig.4b). in line with
our previous studies (uhlig et al. 1995; uhlig and featherstone 1997), we interpret both phenomena in terms of inhibition of eta-receptors at low and of etb-receptors at
higher concentrations.
the ic50-values for eta-receptor-dependent bronchodilation (0.3 µm) and vasoconstriction (0.2 µm) were
very consistent. this suggests that the same receptor subtype is responsible for both effects. the interpretation of
the ic50-values for etb-receptor-related phenomena is
more complicated. there appear to be two classes of
ic50-values (table 1), i.e. those ranging from 2 µm to
6 µm and those ranging from 13 µm to 50 µm. the
differences in the ic50-values of  xxxd358xxx  between et-1and irl1620-induced vasoconstriction are difficult to explain and may be the result of mutual receptor interactions. however, those etb-receptor-related ic50-values
relating to bronchoconstriction and to prostacyclin release
are consistent between stimulation with et-1 or irl1620
as well as between the ipl and the slices. thus, the etbreceptor-mediated prostacyclin release is more sensitive
to  xxxd358xxx  than is the etb-receptor-mediated bronchoconstriction. these two differing ic50-values cannot
be explained by the fact that  xxxd358xxx  was diluted on its
way from the vessels to the airways, since we observed
similar – if somewhat lower – ic50-values also with the
slices (table 1). in addition, the schild regression for the
two etb-receptor agonists  xxxg675xxx  and irl1620 was different from unity, disregarding the existence of a single simple receptor. furthermore, the pkb-values for  xxxg675xxx  and
irl1620 that are shown in table 2 indicate the presence
of two binding sites, one below and one above 1 µm
 xxxd358xxx . taken together, this suggests the existence of
two distinct etb-receptor subtypes. however, while several pharmacological studies have now provided evidence
for etb-receptor subtypes (slee et al. 1994; uhlig et al.
1995; michael and markewitz 1996; hay et al. 1998;
masiro et al. 1998; nambi et al. 1998), their existence
could not be confirmed at a molecular level (mizuguchi et
al. 1997). a possible explanation is that of alternative splicing of etb-receptors (elshourbagy et al. 1996). in the latter
study it was shown that the alternatively spliced receptors
are functionally different, although as of now no links between these splice variants and the different etb-mediated
responses relevant to the present work have been shown.
however, different etb-receptor subtypes may not explain all findings. in particular, it is unknown why in perfused lungs 100 µm  xxxd358xxx  completely prevented the
irl1620-induced bronchoconstriction, but was quite ineffective against et-1. similarly in the pcls 100 µm
 xxxd358xxx  caused only a fivefold rightward shift of the
et-1 concentration-response curve, but an approximately
50-fold shift in the case of the two etb-receptor agonists
(irl1620 46-fold,  xxxg675xxx  64-fold). this contrasts to previous investigations that full blockade (with bq123 and
bq788) of both eta- and etb-receptors is sufficient for
nearly complete protection from et-1-elicited lung failure

(uhlig and featherstone 1997). these findings suggest
one of two alternatives: (1) that complex interactions between eta- and etb-receptors occur that do not follow
linear logic. this view is supported by the finding that for
simultaneous inhibition of eta- and etb-receptors to be
successful, e.g. with bq123 and bq788, both antagonists
must be present at the same concentration (uhlig and
featherstone 1997). thus, mixed antagonists such as
 xxxd358xxx  that favour one receptor over the other may not
confer protection against some of the etb-receptor-mediated processes. it should be noted, however, that even in
the presence of balanced eta- and etb-receptor blockade
the et-1-induced bronchoconstriction is not completely
prevented, thus leaving room for yet another receptor. (2)
that et-1 activates receptors other than eta or etb that
do not recognise irl1620. at least 10%–20% of the
et-1-induced bronchoconstriction may be due to such a
receptor as suggested by binding studies (hay et al. 1998)
and by the fact that the et-1-induced bronchoconstriction
is prevented to only about 90% in the presence of bq123
(eta-selective) and bq788 (etb-selective; uhlig and
featherstone 1997). again, as with the putative etb-receptor subtypes there are several pharmacological investigations in support of this hypothesis (kizawa et al. 1994;
nakajima et al. 1995; widdowso and kirk 1996), but
there is no confirmation at the molecular level.
in summary, the pharmacology of et-1-elicited acute
perturbations in airway and vascular physiology is highly
complex, since eta- and etb-receptors appear to act as
dilators and constrictors of both airway and pulmonary
vascular smooth muscles depending on their anatomical
distribution. the complexity of these interactions is indicated by the present findings that the mixed eta/etb-receptor antagonist  xxxd358xxx  (1) prevented the eta-dependent vasoconstriction and bronchodilation, (2) prevented
irl1620-induced bronchoconstriction and prostacyclin
release with different ic50-values, (3) produced a slope
different from 1 in the schild analysis when tested against
the etb-selective agonists irl1620 or  xxxg675xxx , and (4) was
largely ineffective against the et-1-induced bronchoconstriction. these findings suggest the existence of further
etb-like receptor subtypes.
