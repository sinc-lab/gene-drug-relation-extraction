summary:  xxxd2092xxx  is unique among the dihydropyri-
dine calcium antagonists in that it is the most potent in
relaxing porcine coronary arteries (ics) = 1.5 x 107!
m); it is not as sensitive to photoinactivation as nifedipine
and  xxxd2734xxx , and it is fluorescent. the fluorescence of
 xxxd2092xxx  has allowed us to study many aspects of its
interaction with various calcium-binding proteins in
muscle, including calmodulin, skeletal  xxxg2307xxx , and
 xxxg2307xxx . calcium binding to the calcium-spe-
cific regulatory sites on these proteins exposes allosteri-
cally related  xxxd2092xxx -binding sites. the binding of
other calmodulin antagonists and calcium antagonists, in-
cluding  xxxd3007xxx , r24571, and diltiazem, to these cal-
cium-binding proteins abolishes the cooperativity be-
tween two  xxxd2092xxx -binding sites, resulting in  xxxd2092xxx 
binding to the remaining site with a 20-25-fold greater
affinity. in addition, the binding of high-affinity drugs to
these calcium-dependent hydrophobic sites on these cal-
cium-binding proteins produces dramatic increases
(40-50-fold) in their affinity for calcium. the affinity

the divalent cation calcium is now widely recog-
nized as a universal messenger and mediator of in-
tracellular responses. in particular, a rise in intra-
cellular calcium is responsible for the contraction of
heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle. both heart and
smooth muscle require an influx of extracellular
calcium for sustained tension. the primary route of
calcium influx in heart and vascular smooth muscle
is the slow voltage dependent calcium channel (1).
when this channel is selectively inhibited by cal-
cium antagonists or calcium channel blockers— in-
cluding diltiazem, verapamil, or dihydropyridines,
such as  xxxd2092xxx  or nifedipine—calcium entry is
blocked and relaxation ensues. fortunately, selec-
tive calcium channel blockade of vascular smooth
muscle over heart muscle can be achieved. this
allows vasodilatation without negative inotropic ef-

of  xxxd2092xxx  for these calcium-binding proteins is
100—1,000 times lower than  xxxd2092xxx ’s ic.9 for relaxing
tension in coronary arteries, indicating that these cal-
cium-binding proteins are probably not the primary re-
ceptors for  xxxd2092xxx . similarities between the binding of
dihydropyridines to the calcium channel and to these cal-
cium-binding proteins have led us to suggest that a ‘‘cal-
modulin-like’’ calcium-binding protein on the calcium
channel is the actual pharmacological receptor for dihy-
dropyridine calcium channel antagonists. this ‘‘ xxxd1866xxx -
ulin-like’’ component of the channel could explain the
calcium-dependent binding and allosteric interactions
among calcium antagonists that have been reported to
occur on the calcium channel. further, studies of the sim-
ilarities among calcium-binding proteins have allowed us
to hypothesize as to how these channel blockers might
act to inhibit calcium influx through calcium channels.

fects on the heart. the compounds offering the
greatest selectivity are the dihydropyridines, and in
particular,  xxxd2092xxx . it is of interest, therefore, to
understand the mechanism of action of  xxxd2092xxx 
and to determine its pharmacological receptors. in
addition to its probable interaction and blockade of
calcium channels,  xxxd2092xxx  binds to other cal-
cium-binding proteins within the cell (2-4).
whether or not these secondary receptors play a
role in mediating its pharmacological response (se-
lective dilatation of the vasculature) is uncertain.
our studies of  xxxd2092xxx ’s interaction with these
lower affinity calcium-binding proteins (including
calmodulin and  xxxg2307xxx ) have, however, taught
us much about the mechanism of action of these
proteins and the mechanism by which  xxxd2092xxx

latation. it is these results that we discuss in this
article.

methods

fluorescence measurements were conducted as pre-
viously described (3,4) and free calcium concentrations
were determined in egta-calcium buffer systems as
previously described (5). protein concentrations were de-
termined by the  xxxd2444xxx  method or by absorbance at 280
nm. calmodulin was purified from spinach by the method

of watterson et al. (6), and from testes by the method of

crouch et al. (7).  xxxd2092xxx  was obtained from hassle,
moolndal, sweden. r24571 (calmidazolium) was obtained
from janssen laboratories, diltiazem from marion phar-
maceutical, and  xxxd3007xxx  from chinion pharmaceu-
tical. all other chemicals were reagent grade. tension
measurements in coronary arteries were conducted as
previously described (8).

results

among the current calcium antagonists, the dihy-
dropyridine  xxxd2092xxx  is the most powerful coro-
nary dilator. figure | shows dose-response curves
of coronary arteries, contracted with kcl, to
various calcium antagonists.  xxxd2092xxx  is most ef-
fective with an icsy of 1.5 x 107!'° m. this indi-
cates that  xxxd2092xxx  is nearly seven times more ef-
fective than nifedipine (ics) | x 10~? m) and 1,700
times more effective than diltiazem (ics) = 2.6 x
10-7 m) as a coronary dilator. since  xxxd2092xxx  is
not an effective negative inotropic agent in the
heart, it has a very high selectivity for relaxing cor-
onary arteries over heart muscle.

while several other dihydropyridines (including
nifedipine and  xxxd2734xxx ) absorb light in the
330—360 nm range and photoinactivate (9), felodi-
pine absorbs this light and emits it as fluorescence.

 xxxd2092xxx ’s fluorescence intensity is very sensitive
to the polarity of its microenvironment and it may,
therefore, be used to monitor  xxxd2092xxx ’s interac-
tion with its target proteins. previously, we have
shown that in the presence of calcium,  xxxd2092xxx 
binds to two sites on calmodulin in a highly cooper-
ative fashion (hill coefficient = 2.0) with an ap-
parent ky; of 8-14 x 10~® m) (3,4). a calcium-
and calmodulin-dependent increase in  xxxd2092xxx 
fluorescence was observed and this fluorescence
increase correlated well with +h- xxxd2092xxx  binding
(4). thus,  xxxd2092xxx  binding can be accurately
monitored by this increase in its fluorescence.
 xxxd2092xxx  binding to its hydrophobic binding
site(s) on calmodulin can be greatly enhanced by
the binding of calmodulin antagonist drugs and cal-
cium antagonist drugs to calmodulin. this potentia-
tion of  xxxd2092xxx  binding (fluorescence) to  xxxd1866xxx -
ulin by r24571, by  xxxd3007xxx , and by the triva-
lent cation lanthanum is shown in fig. 2. lower
drug concentrations produce a fluorescence in-
crease, while higher concentrations of r24571 or
 xxxd3007xxx  produce a decrease in  xxxd2092xxx  fluo-
rescence. further analysis revealed that at maxi-
mally potentiating concentrations of r24571 and
 xxxd3007xxx ,  xxxd2092xxx  was bound with 25-fold
higher affinity (ky); = 0.3-0.4 4m) with a loss of
cooperativity among its two binding sites (hill coef-
ficient = 1.0) (4). thus, potentiating drugs abolish
the cooperativity between  xxxd2092xxx ’s binding sites
on calmodulin and allosterically potentiate felodi-
pine binding to the remaining site with a 25-fold en-
hanced affinity. at higher concentrations, these po-
tentiating drugs are able to displace  xxxd2092xxx  from
its high-affinity site and produce the observed de-
crease in fluorescence (3,4). metal cations, in-
cluding lanthanum, cadmium, lead, and zinc, bind
to sites on calmodulin that are distinct from its cal-

and 2.0 um  xxxd2092xxx . buffer in each case was 10 mm mops, 90 mm kci, and 1 mm  xxxg2125xxx , at ph 7.0. titrations and fluorescence
measurements were as previously described (3). the total fluorescence enhancements (at 100%) were 1.4-fold, 1.4-fold, and 4.0

for r24571,  xxxd3007xxx , and lanthanum, respectively.

cium-binding sites to produce this same allosteri-
cally potentiated conformer of calmodulin, which
has a high affinity for  xxxd2092xxx  (10). these studies
provided the first evidence that calmodulin was an
allosteric protein with respect to its hydrophobic
drug binding sites.

other calcium-binding proteins, including skel-
etal  xxxg2307xxx  and  xxxg2307xxx , exhibit sim-
ilar allosteric interactions among their drug-binding
sites. in each case, their binding constants for felo-
dipine can be dramatically increased by prenyla-
mine,  xxxd318xxx , diltiazem, and r24571. figure 3
shows protein titrations of  xxxd2092xxx  in the pres-
ence and absence of potentiating drugs. these data
indicate that in the presence of potentiating drugs,
such as  xxxd3007xxx , the affinity of calmodulin for
 xxxd2092xxx  is increased from approximately 1.2 x
10° to 3 x 107 m~!. the apparent affinity of felodi-
pine for  xxxg2307xxx , in the absence of po-
tentiating drugs, is too low (ky); > 10-4 m) to mea-
sure, because of the insolubility of  xxxd2092xxx . in
the presence of potentiating drugs, such as prenyla-
mine (not shown) or  xxxd318xxx  (fig. 3), its affinity is
increased so that it is similar to its affinity for cal-
modulin in the nonpotentiated state (ky; = 10
w.m). thus, each of the calcium-binding proteins
tested binds  xxxd2092xxx  in a calcium-dependent
manner, and in each case its affinity for  xxxd2092xxx 
could be dramatically increased by potentiating
drugs. both in the potentiated state and in the non-
potentiated state,  xxxd2092xxx ’s affinity for  xxxd1866xxx -
ulin was much greater than its affinity for either
cardiac or skeletal  xxxg2307xxx .

with each of these calcium-binding proteins, cal-
cium was essential for the exposure of the hydro-

 

phobic drug-binding sites that exhibit this allosteric
relationship. in no case could magnesium (up to 5
mm) substitute for calcium. this suggested that
calcium binding to the calcium-specific sites on
these proteins and not the calcium-magnesium sites
(5,11,12) was responsible for the exposure of these
hydrophobic sites on these proteins.

the fluorescent probe, ans, has often been used
to probe hydrophobic surfaces on proteins (5,13) by
the large fluorescence increase that it exhibits when
going from an aqueous to a hydrophobic environ-
ment. figure 4 shows calcium titrations of four cal-

protein and 25 1m ans in 10 mm mops, 90 mm kcl, and 2
mm egta at ph 7.0 as previously described. the excitation
emission wavelengths for ans were 340 and 510 nm.

tein (scbp), calmodulin, skeletal  xxxg2307xxx , and
 xxxg1901xxx , in the presence of ans. scbp, cal-
modulin and skeletal  xxxg2307xxx  all showed an in-
crease in ans fluorescence over the calcium range
where their calcium-specific sites are occupied.
magnesium could not produce this increase in ans
binding (fluorescence). further,  xxxg1901xxx ,
which has two calcium-magnesium sites and no cal-
cium-specific sites, does not show an increase in
ans binding (fluorescence) when its calclum—mag-
nesium sites are occupied by calcium (fig. 4) or by
magnesium (data not shown). these data suggest
that calcium binding to these very important cal-
cium-specific regulatory sites on these proteins ex-
poses these allosterically related hydrophobic drug
binding sites.

calcium binding to these calcium-specific regula-
tory sites in skeletal  xxxg2307xxx , cardiac troponin
c, and calmodulin is fundamental to the action of
these regulatory proteins and the activation of ten-
sion in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, re-
spectively (5,12,14). it is of interest, therefore, that
high-affinity drug binding to these calcium-induced
hydrophobic sites on these proteins can dramati-
cally increase their affinity for calcium at their cal-
cium-specific regulatory sites. previously, we have
used  xxxd2092xxx  fluorescence to show that the high-
affinity (ky; = 1-2 x 10~? m) binding of the cal-
modulin antagonist r24571 to calmodulin produces

j cardiovasc pharmacol, vol. 10 (suppl. 1), 1987

a 40-fold increase in its affinity for calcium at some
of its calcium-specific sites (4). figure 5 shows the
effect of r24571 on the calcium dependence of ty-
rosine fluorescence in both spinach and testes cal-
modulin. in both cases, r24571 shifts the calcium
dependence of the increase in tyrosine fluorescence
to the left from pca = 5.9 to pca = 6.9. testes
calmodulin has two tyrosine residues (99 and 138),
while spinach calmodulin has only tyrosine 138.
this suggests that r24571 can dramatically increase
their affinity for calcium at calcium-binding sites ii
and iv in the carboxy terminal half of calmodulin.
similarly, in both skeletal  xxxg2307xxx  and cardiac
 xxxg2307xxx , the high-affinity binding of r24571 dra-
matically increases their affinity for calcium at their
calcium-specific regulatory sites (johnson et al.,
unpublished observations). thus, in calcium-
binding proteins like calmodulin and  xxxg2307xxx ,
calcium binding to the calcium-specific regulatory
sites exposes allosterically related hydrophobic
drug binding sites and the occupancy of these sites
by high-affinity drugs dramatically increases cal-
cium binding to these important calcium-specific
regulatory sites.

discussion

the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, felodi-
pine, is the most potent dilator of coronary arteries
among known calcium antagonists. it is similar to
other calcium antagonists in that its primary mech-
anism of action is probably the blockade of calcium
channels.  xxxd2092xxx  offers the advantage of a high
degree of selectivity in its relaxation of vascular
smooth muscle over heart muscle. a further advan-
tage of  xxxd2092xxx  is that it is not as sensitive to
photoinactivation as nifedipine and  xxxd2734xxx . in-

fold for spinach calmodulin.

stead,  xxxd2092xxx  is fluorescent. this intrinsic prop-
erty of  xxxd2092xxx  has proved very useful in allowing
us to characterize its binding and interaction with
various calcium-binding proteins. in general, we
find that  xxxd2092xxx  binds to two sites on calmodulin
with affinities in the micromolar range. its binding
shows a high degree of cooperativity. other cal-
modulin antagonists (such as r24571) and calcium
antagonists (including diltiazem,  xxxd318xxx , and pre-
nylamine) bind to calmodulin, abolish the coopera-
tivity between the two binding sites, and dramati-
cally enhance  xxxd2092xxx ’s affinity at the remaining
binding site. in the potentiated state,  xxxd2092xxx ’s
affinity for calmodulin is as high as 3 x 107 m~!.
other calcium-binding proteins, including cardiac
and skeletal  xxxg2307xxx , bind  xxxd2092xxx  with sub-
stantially lower affinity but do exhibit a similar po-
tentiation of  xxxd2092xxx  binding by other drugs, in-
cluding  xxxd3007xxx ,  xxxd318xxx , and r24571. in the
presence of a potentiator, the affinity of cardiac
 xxxg2307xxx  for  xxxd2092xxx  is increased to 10 um. in
each case, calcium is necessary for  xxxd2092xxx 
binding to these proteins. magnesium will not sup-
port drug binding, which suggests that calcium
binding to the calcium-specific regulatory sites on
these proteins exposes their allosterically related
hydrophobic drug binding sites.

consistent with this, we find that high-affinity
drug binding to these sites on calmodulin and tro-
ponin c dramatically enhances calcium binding to
the calcium-specific sites on these proteins. from a
thermodynamic point of view, if calcium binding
exposes drug-binding sites, then drug binding
would support that particular conformation of the
protein and increase the affinity of those calcium-
binding sites for calcium. this is observed experi-
mentally. in a number of calcium-binding proteins,
calcium binding to the calcium-specific sites, selec-
tively, exposed hydrophobic binding sites on these
calcium-binding proteins. occupancy of these
drug-binding sites, in turn, increased calcium af-
finity at these calcium-specific regulatory sites.

these hydrophobic drug binding sites on  xxxd1866xxx -
ulin and  xxxg2307xxx  are thought to be the same sites
at which these calcium-binding proteins interact
with the proteins that they regulate in a calcium-de-
pendent manner (15-17). consistent with this, the
binding of troponin i to  xxxg2307xxx  (18) and of
myosin light chain kinase to calmodulin (7,14) are
both calcium dependent. further, the binding of
these proteins mimics high-affinity drug binding in
that all serve to increase the affinity of calcium for
these calcium-binding proteins (4,19,20).

these calcium-dependent regulatory proteins
seem to share a common mechanism: calcium
binding facilitates their interaction with the proteins
that they activate or with certain hydrophobic cal-
cium antagonist drugs. in turn, drug or protein
binding to the calcium-sensitive hydrophobic sites

on these calcium-binding proteins dramatically in-
creases their affinity for calcium. the increase in
calcium affinity that is observed with protein
binding to these calcium-binding proteins would
serve to decrease the off-rate of calcium from these
calcium-binding proteins. this would insure that
the activated calcium— xxxg2038xxx -
protein complex would have a longer lifetime than
when the calcium-binding protein was not com-
plexed with its target protein (21,22).

calcium antagonist and calmodulin antagonist
drugs can effectively interfere with the transduction
of the calcium signal in the cell by binding to these
calcium-binding proteins at the sites where they
normally bind and regulate other proteins. we feel
that most calcium antagonist drugs work by binding
to important calcium receptors or calcium-binding
proteins in the cell. calmodulin and its calcium-de-
pendent interactions with drugs and proteins pro-
vide a good model for examining these drug effects
on other calcium-binding proteins.

calmodulin has two  xxxd2092xxx -binding sites and
it is known to have two hydrophobic drug-binding
regions on its surface. when calmodulin is cleaved
at residue 77, the molecule is effectively cut in half.
both fragments 1-77 and 78-148 contain two cal-
cium-binding sites and one hydrophobic drug-
binding site. each half undergoes very similar cal-
cium-induced structural changes, including in-
creases in a-helix and the binding of hydrophobic
fluorescence probes, such as ans and tns
(23,24). our studies (24) of calmodulin fragments
suggest that fragments 1-77 and 78-148 do not
show strong calcium-dependent  xxxd2092xxx  binding.
fragments 1—90 and 1-106 do, however, bind felo-
dipine in a calcium-dependent manner. further, the
allosteric potentiation of  xxxd2092xxx  binding that
was observed in intact calmodulin was not seen in
1-90 or 1-106. these data suggest that perhaps the
hydrophobic region in residues 1-77, as well as in-
teractions in residues 78-90, are prerequisite for
 xxxd2092xxx  binding (24). the additional calcium-de-
pendent hydrophobic site located in residues
78-148 may be necessary for the binding of drugs
such as r24571 and  xxxd3007xxx  to potentiate felo-
dipine binding to a site in fragment 1-90. consis-
tent with this, r24571 binding to testes calmodulin
and spinach calmodulin can dramatically increase
the affinity of calcium at calcium-binding sites iii
and iv, which are located in the carboxyl terminal
half of calmodulin.

recently, the three-dimensional structure of cal-
modulin has been determined (25). calmodulin is a
dumbbell-shaped protein wih a long region of a-helix
connecting calcium-binding sites i and ii with cal-
cium-binding sites iii and iv. in addition to the hy-
drophobic regions existing in 1-77 and 78-148, re-
gions of this central helix may be very important in
regulating drug and calcium binding to each half of

calmodulin. it is clear that an intact central helix is
necessary for the allosteric effects among  xxxd1866xxx -
ulin’s drug-binding sites. for example, although
fragment 1-106 binds  xxxd2092xxx , its binding is not
allosterically regulated by  xxxd3007xxx  as it is in in-
tact calmodulin (24). thus, the two halves of cal-
modulin can presumably regulate one another in
terms of their calcium- and drug (protein)-binding
affinities through this important central helix,
which connects them to one another.

 xxxd2092xxx  binding to calmodulin and  xxxg2307xxx 
is of rather low affinity compared with its affinity
for the putative calcium channels. the highest af-
finity that we have yet been able to achieve is 0.3
um, for  xxxd2092xxx  binding to calmodulin in the
presence of potentiating drugs ( xxxd3007xxx ,
r24571) or a metal cation (such as lanthanum and
zinc) (4,10). the affinity of  xxxd2092xxx  for  xxxd1866xxx -
ulin is nearly 2,000 times less than the icso for felo-
dipine relaxing coronary arteries (fig. 1). unless
endogenous potentiators of calmodulin and tro-
ponin c dramatically increase the affinity of felodi-
pine for these calcium-binding proteins in the cell,
we feel that neither calmodulin nor  xxxg2307xxx  rep-
resent major pharmacological receptors for felodi-
pine. we feel that the primary receptor for felodi-
pine and for other dihydropyridines is the voltage-
dependent calcium channel. this is consistent with
the work of many others who have studied radioli-
gand binding to purified membrane fractions (see
26) and to isolated calcium channel proteins (27).
the calcium channel is a calcium-binding protein
and it is very interesting to compare this calcium-
binding protein with calmodulin and  xxxg2307xxx 
mentioned previously. in both the calcium channel
and calmodulin, for instance, we find:

(a) calcium binds in the micromolar range to regu-
late both the channel and calmodulin.

(b) calcium binding is necessary for the binding of
dihydropyridines to both calmodulin and the
calcium channel (3,4,26,28).

(c) calcium protects calmodulin and calcium
channels from heat denaturation.

(d) calmodulin antagonists (including trifluopera-
zine, r24571, and w-7), which are supposed to
be specific for calmodulin, bind to the calcium
channel (29-31).

(e) calcium channel blockers (including dihydro-
pyridines,  xxxd3007xxx , verapamil,  xxxd318xxx ,
and diltiazem) bind to calmodulin (3,4).

(f) both calmodulin and the calcium channel ex-
hibit allosterically related, calcium-dependent,
drug-binding sites. for example, diltiazem is
known to potentiate dihydropyridine binding
both to calcium channels and to calmodulin (see
refs. 3 and 26).

the most likely explanation for these similarities
is that the calcium channel has a domain that binds

j cardiovasc pharmacol, vol. 10 (suppl. 1), 1987

calcium and exposes allosterically related drug-
binding sites. we have previously suggested that
the pharmacological receptor of calcium channel
blocking drugs is a calmodulin-like component of
the calcium channel (34). this calcium-binding pro-
tein of the channel would presumably have higher
affinity  xxxd2092xxx  (dihydropyridine) binding sites
than calmodulin, but they would be regulated by
calcium and by diltiazem in a manner analogous to
what we have reported for calmodulin (3,4). this
scheme is represented in fig. 6. here, calcium is
shown entering the depolarized calcium channel
and passing through to the cytosol. both smooth
muscle and heart muscle show a process of calcium
inactivation of their calcium channels (32,33). this
occurs as calcium concentrations at the intracel-
lular mouth of the channel increase and result in
channel blockade. presumably, a calcium sensor
near the intracellular mouth of the channel recog-
nizes this increase in intracellular calcium resulting
in channel blockade. this could be due to a cal-
cium-dependent conformational change in the
channel or to inhibition of calcium exit from the
channel owing to high intracellular calcium levels.
if this calcium-binding sensor (calcium-binding pro-
tein) is the receptor for calcium antagonist drugs,
then with their high-affinity binding, the affinity of
this calcium sensor for calcium would be increased
and the channel would be blocked as if intracellular
calcium had been increased. thus, calcium antago-
nists may cause channel blockade by potentiating
calcium inactivation of these calcium channels.
consistent with this hypothesis is the observation

fig. 6. a schematic representation of a hypothesis for cal-
cium channel blockade by calcium and by calcium antago-
nist drugs. the channel is shown in the depolarized state.
calcium binds to an extracellular site (1), transverses the
channel and enters the cell. under conditions of high intra-
cellular calcium, calcium binds to a calcium-binding protein
(calcium sensor) exposed to the intracellular space, re-
sulting in a conformational change and channel blockade
(calcium inactivation of calcium channels). high intracellular
calcium could also prevent dissociation of calcium from this
calcium sensor and thereby prevent calcium entry into the
channel (not shown). if this calcium-binding protein that
gates the calcium channel is the pharmacological receptor
for calcium antagonists, then it would bind calcium antago-
nists [including diltiazem (d) and  xxxd2092xxx  (f)] in a cal-
cium-dependent manner. the high affinity binding of these
calcium antagonists may increase the affinity of calcium for
this calcium-binding protein, resulting in channel blockade
by calcium inactivation of the channel, even under condition
of low intracellular free calcium.

 
 xxxd2092xxx  and calcium-binding proteins s59

that calcium channels involved in excitation—secre-
tion coupling do not calcium inactivate and they are
insensitive to calcium antagonist drugs (33). this
hypothesis for a mechanism of action of calcium
antagonists and calcium channel blockade remains
to be tested.
