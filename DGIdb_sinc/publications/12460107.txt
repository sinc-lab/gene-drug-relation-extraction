glycogen phosphorylase (1,4alphadglucan: ortho
phosphatealphadglucosyltransferase;  xxxg909xxx   xxxg2386xxx .1) is a key
enzyme of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle.
phosphorylase catalyzes the first step in the pathway of
degradation of the principal storage form of carbohydrate
in muscle—glycogen:
→ (alpha1,4glycoside)n–1 +
(alpha1,4glycoside)n + pi ←
+ alphadglucose 1phosphate,
where n is the number of glucose residues. the phospho
rolytic cleavage of the alpha1,4glucosidic bonds proceeds
from the nonreducing ends of the glycogen chain, and
phosphorylase extends the splitting up to the fourth
residue from a point of branching. the reaction catalyzed
by phosphorylase is reversible and the ratio of the equilib
rium concentrations [glucose 1phosphate]/[pi] is 0.28 at
ph 6.8. however, in vivo the enzyme acts only in the
direction of glycogen phosphorolysis because in the cell
the inorganic phosphate concentration significantly
exceeds that of glucose 1phosphate. the physiological
role of phosphorylase in skeletal muscle is that it provides
an energy source by generating glucose 1phosphate via
the phosphorylase reaction.

phosphorylase activity in muscles was discovered in
1936 by parnas [1] and by cori and cori [2] and since that
time during more than six decades phosphorylase contin
ues to be the subject of very intensive research throughout
the world. many years of phosphorylase study brought a
number of fundamental discoveries founding the develop
ment of several new promising lines in enzymology. thus,
phosphorylase was the first enzyme shown to undergo
allosteric activation by an effector (amp) which has no
structural similarity to the substrate [3, 4]; phosphorylase
was the first enzyme demonstrated to be regulated by
transitions at the level of its quaternary structure [5, 6];
covalent modification via phosphorylation was also
described for the first time for muscle phosphorylase [7];
phosphorylase was unique among pyridoxal enzymes
where a phosphate but not an aldimine group of the
cofactor participates in the catalysis [8]. the properties of
glycogen phosphorylase have been elucidated in several
reviews [812].
phosphorylase comprising up to 2% of the total
amount of soluble protein in muscle tissue exists in rest
ing muscle as an inactive (without amp) nonphospho
rylated form b. phosphorylase b is regulated by several
effectors, among which amp and imp are known as acti
vators [3], atp and adp [13, 14], purines [15], flavins
[16], dglucose and udpglucose [17, 18] as inhibitors.
phb in solution without any additions exists as a
dimer and pha under high concentration of the enzyme
as a tetramer [19]. a dimer of phosphorylase consists of
two symmetrically positioned monomers with the full set

of the binding sites for specific ligands. however, the
active conformation the enzyme develops only in the
dimeric form; tetramers are inactive [20]. monomers
show no catalytic activity as well [21]. each monomer
contains 842 amino acid residues and one residue of plp
and has a relative molecular mass 97,432 daltons. the
amino acid sequence of the monomer polypeptide chain
has been established [22, 23].
a schematic ribbon diagram of the phb monomer is
shown in fig. 1 [24]. each monomer represents a protein
of alphabeta type with the polypeptide chain folded into a rather
compact globule with radius of 3 nm, consisting of two sep
arate domains: nterminal (residues 10484) and ctermi
nal (residues 485842). the catalytic site, identified by
binding of the substrates glucose 1phosphate, pi, and
glycogen and of the competitive inhibitor glucose, is locat
ed in a deep crevice between the two domains in the center

of the molecule. the cofactor necessary for the activity,
plp, also constitutes part of the active site. the aldehyde
group of plp is bound as a schiff base with lys680 [25].
the allosteric regulatory site is positioned at the sub
unit interface in the dimer and its distance from the active
site is approximately 3.3 nm [26]. at this site, binding of
both allosteric activators (amp, imp) and inhibitors
(atp, glucose 6phosphate, udpglucose) occurs.
glucose 6phosphate is a potent physiological inhibitor
of phb, being a classic feedback inhibitor. it is constantly
generated in muscle from the product of the phosphory
lase reaction, glucose 1phosphate, by phosphoglucomu
tase, and ensures that phb is inactive in resting muscle.
in the region of the subunit interface, at a distance of
1.2 nm from the nucleotide site, the phosphorylation site
is identified as ser14 [27]. in fig. 1 it is not indicated
because the nterminal tail (residues 1 to 18) is disor

pyridoxal 5′phosphate in glycogen phosphorylase
dered and could not be localized it in the molecule of phb
by crystallographic methods. after phosphorylation of
ser14 by phosphorylase kinase, the phosphate group
interacts with arg69 of the same subunit, and with arg43
of the neighboring subunit, and the appearance of a dian
ion causes the ordering of the basic ntail.
at the entrance into the tunnel leading to the cat
alytic site, at a distance of approximately 1 nm from this
site, the nucleoside (inhibitor) site is located. in the t
state of phosphorylase, various heterocyclic compounds
(adenine, adenosine, caffeine, flavins) are able to bind to
this site [10, 28, 29]. upon binding to this site, the
inhibitors are intercalated between the aromatic side
chains of phe285, which belongs to the nterminal
domain, and tyr613, which belongs to the cterminal
domain, and close the entrance to the active site. amp
and imp are also able to bind to the nucleoside site with
low affinity, in this case acting as inhibitors.
a special “glycogen storage site” is located on the
surface of the protein globule at the side of the
dimer–dimer interface at a distance of approximately
3 nm from the active site [10]. this is, probably, the site of
phosphorylase binding to glycogen granules. it should be
noted that in skeletal muscle up to 70% of the whole
amount of phosphorylase, existing in a dimeric form as a
complex with glycogen, is localized in these granules in
addition to other enzymes of glycogen metabolism [30].
the subunit interface of the dimer is composed of two
main contact regions: one is formed between the “cap”
region, a loop connecting the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and  xxxg831xxx  helices of one
subunit with the beta7 strand, and the  xxxg831xxx  helix of the oppo
site subunit (this area includes amp and serp binding
sites). antiparallel association of the two symmetryrelat
ed “tower”helicesalpha7 forms the other contact [27].
the dephosphorylated form b displays more pro
nounced allosteric regulation by effectors. the existence
of the active conformation, r, induced by activator amp
and by substrates, and the less active one, t, induced by
allosteric inhibitors, were first postulated in 1967 by
helmreich et al. [31]. later, the molecular mechanism of

by johnson’s group [27].

first by braunstein and shemyakin [3436] and by snell
and coworkers [37]. according to this mechanism, the
main intermediate step in the reactions of such a type is
the formation of schiff base between  xxxd3047xxx 
(or  xxxd3048xxx ) and proper amino acid (or
keto acid). in such “classic” pyridoxal enzymes cofactor is
bound as a schiff base (by aldimine bond) with epsilonamino
group of corresponding lysine residue of the protein mol
ecule. the presence of this bond is a necessary condition
to display the catalytic activity. reduction of aldimine
bond with sodium borohydride causes complete and irre
versible loss of activity. phosphorylase in this sense is not
typical pyridoxal enzyme. though plp in phosphorylase
as in other pyridoxal enzymes is connected by aldimine
bond with epsilonamino group of lys680 [25], the existence of
this bond is not essential for the phosphorylase reaction,
and its reduction by sodium borohydride irreversibly fixes
plp on the enzyme with retention of 60% activity of the
native enzyme [38]. thus, the aldehyde group of plp in
position 4, which is necessary for the binding of cofactor,
is not involved in catalysis. this is not surprising because
phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of
glycogen, and it does not participate in amino acid metab
olism. the resolution of phb under mild conditions
(preincubation in the protein structure deforming imida
zole citrate buffer with subsequent removal of plp by l
cysteine) causes the formation of completely inactive
apoenzyme, which easy dissociates into monomers [39].
this raised the question of whether plp functions as
a structural ligand stabilizing the active dimeric structure
of phb, or it is involved in catalysis. the use of different
chemical analogs of plp with modification in every posi
tion around the pyridine ring showed that plp not only
supports the native structure of enzyme, but also partici
pates in catalysis [8, 33, 4042]. partial or complete
restoration of enzymatic activity occurred under recon
struction with analogs modified in positions 2, 3, and 6 of
the pyridine ring of plp.

role of plp as a catalytic cofactor
pyridoxal 5′phosphate was discovered in 1957 by
baranowski et al. [32] in rabbit muscle glycogen phospho
rylase a in a stoichiometric ratio of 1 mole per mole of
subunit. all glycogen phosphorylase prepared from differ
ent sources of animal, plant, and microbial origin contain
plp in the same stoichiometric ratio [33]. plp partici
pates as a cofactor in several enzymatic reactions of amino
acid metabolism (transamination, decarboxylation,
betaelimination, etc.). as a basis of all these reactions, so
unlike on first sight, is the common mechanism discovered
biochemistry (moscow) vol. 67 no. 10

none of the analogs modified in position 4 restored
enzymatic activity. once bound, however, the formyl
group can be modified, e.g., by sodium borohydride
reduction that covalently fixes the cofactor to the protein
with retention of activity. this means that formyl group in
position 4 takes part in the binding of cofactor with pro
tein, but not in catalysis. the modification of pyridine
ring in position 1, and all modifications of the 5′phos
phate group yielded inactive phosphorylase.

are shown by crosses [45].

it was shown by the studies of graves’s laboratory
[43, 44] that the phosphate moieties of plp and the sub
strate phosphates are sufficiently close together in phos
phorylase to interact directly.
the exact arrangement of plp in phosphorylase
molecule and the nature of amino acid residues of the
protein molecule interacting with the distinct structural
elements of cofactor became evident after xray analysis
of johnson et al. [45]. the cofactor is buried in a highly
hydrophobic environment, and its aldehyde group is
binding as a schiff base with lys680. plp is stabilized in
a fixed conformation through many noncovalent interac
tions of the side groups of cofactor with the amino acid
residues of both c and nterminal domains (fig. 2).
among such interactions the interaction of the pyridine
ring of cofactor with the neighboring three aromatic rings
tyr90, trp491, and tyr648 residues should be noted, and
also the numerous vanderwaals interactions of c2′
methyl group and c6′atom of the pyridine ring with
residues gly134, gly135, and leu136. besides that, three
oxygen atoms of the phosphate group of the cofactor form
many hydrogen bonds both directly with the terminal
groups of the amino acid residues (lys568, thr676,
gly677), and via water molecules with the far removed
groups.
upon the allosteric transition t → r the affinity of
the catalytic site for phosphate increases 15fold [46, 47].
the sequence of events upon this transition begins with
antiparallel interaction of two symmetrical tower

alphahelices of the two neighboring subunits. the tower
alphahelix is immediately connected with loop 280s which
is then displaced and opens the entrance to the active site,
simultaneously blocking access to the inhibitory site. in
addition, displacement of this loop causes a shift of the
side chain of arg569 of the active site by 0.7 nm. the
basic residue arg569 replaces the acidic residue asp283.
this replacement ensures the increase in affinity to the
phosphate group of the substrate and makes possible a
closer contact between the substrate anion and anion of
the cofactor, plp, which constitutes an important part of
the catalytic mechanism. as was shown by xray analysis
[27] and nmr spectroscopy [48], upon transition from t
into rstate, and upon activation by phosphorylation the
phosphate group of plp is converted from monoanion to
dianion, and it reverts to a monoanion upon ligation of the
substrate phosphate. plp is located inside a structurally
conservative area, and therefore the cofactor does not
change its position upon the t → r transition [24].
nowadays is commonly accepted the mechanism of
phosphorylase reaction proposed by helmreich and
coworkers [33, 4951]. according to this mechanism, 5′
phosphate group of plp is functioning in phosphorylase
in the form of dianion as a proton donoracceptor
according to the general scheme of acidbase catalysis.
figure 3 presents in detail the mechanism of plp partic
ipation in the reaction catalyzed by muscle phosphory
lase. when the reaction proceeds in the forward direction
(phosphorolysis of alpha1,4glycosidic bond) the first step is
the protonation of the glycoside oxygen by orthophos
phate. the oxocarbonium ion formed is stabilized by
phosphateanion. the subsequent covalent binding of
phosphate causes the formation of glucose 1phosphate.
when the reaction proceeds in the reverse direction (syn

thesis of oligosaccharides) the protonation of the phos
phate group of glucose 1phosphate destabilizes the gly
coside bond, and that favors the formation of the couple
glycosyloxocarbonium ion–phosphateanion. phosphate
anion substantially facilitates the nucleophilic attack of
the terminal glycosylic residue to the carbonium ion. this
sequence of the reactions causes the formation of
alpha1,4glycosidic bond and increase in the number of gly
cosidic residues in oligosaccharide primer. thus, the
function of plp in the reaction catalyzed by phosphory
lase is absolutely different compared to other plp
dependent enzymes.

role of plp
as a conformational cofactor
quaternary structure of holoenzyme, apoenzyme, and
enzyme reconstructed with plp analogs. phb in solution
without any additions exists as a dimer which attains the
active conformation in the presence of allosteric activa
tor—amp [19]. at rather high concentration of the
enzyme in the presence of amp the active dimer is trans
formed into the inactive tetramer; the formation of the
tetramer is favored by low temperature [52]. the addition
of high molecular weight substrate glycogen causes the
dissociation of tetramer into dimers [8]. the equilibrium
→ tetramer is moved in favor of dimer in the
dimer ←
presence of inhibitors—glucose [8, 52] and fmn [16, 53,
54]. the dimers of holoenzyme dissociate into monomers
only under rather harsh conditions (in the presence of
pcmb [5]).
apophosphorylase b (apophb) was firstly obtained in
1957 by cori and illingworth [55] by precipitation of the
enzyme with ammonium sulfate at ph 3.4. the main part
of the enzyme was denatured under such conditions. but
it was possible to reactivate part of the apoenzyme leaving
in solution by incubation at ph 6.0 with the equimolar
quantity of plp. in 1966 shaltiel et al. [56] proposed the
new, mild method of resolution of plp from phb, includ
ing two steps: the exposure of plp on the surface of the
protein globule by incubation with the structure deform
ing reagent, imidazole citrate buffer at ph 6.2, and subse
quent removal of plp by lcysteine. the apoenzyme
obtained in such a way was practically inactive, but was
reconstructed and reactivated by incubation with
equimolar amount of plp by approximately 95%. the
study of the properties of apophb showed that it is much
more labile than the holoenzyme and presents a typical
association–dissociation system with the state of aggrega
tion very sensitive to the change of physicochemical con
ditions [39, 57, 58]. decrease in temperature and increase
in the protein concentration cause the aggregation of
apoenzyme. in betaglycerophosphate buffer in temperature
intervals 1535°c at the protein concentration until
1 mg/ml apoenzyme exists as a monomer (sedimentation

coefficient s20,w = 5.15.3 s),  xxxd1891xxx °c as a dimer (s20,w =
7.4 s) (table 1) [58], and at 1°c as a mixture of dimers,
tetramers, and aggregates [39]. it should be noted that
holophb in the absence of amp exists exclusively as a
dimer independent of temperature.
apophb retains the ability to interact with amp
because the addition of this nucleotide results in the asso
ciation and crystallization of the apoenzyme and protects
it from denaturation in storage. apophb retains the abili
ty to transform into apopha on incubation with phospho
rylase kinase, i.e., the phosphorylation site, ser14, does
not change significantly its position in the apoenzyme as
compared to holophb [8, 39]. however, apo and holoen
 xxxg1282xxx  have different affinity for the high molecular weight
substrate, glycogen, and to the allosteric inhibitor, fmn.
to calculate the dissociation constant (kdiss) of the com
plex of phosphorylase with glycogen, we used the follow
ing equation: r = rmax/(1 + kdiss/[e]), where r is the degree
of saturation of glycogen by phb expressed as moles of
phb bound with 1 g of glycogen, rmax is the adsorption
capacity of glycogen, and [e] is the equilibrium concen
tration of enzyme. the adsorption capacity of glycogen
was taken to be identical both for holo and apoenzyme
(rmax = 3.6·10–6 moles of bound enzyme dimers per 1 g of
glycogen or 0.71 g of enzyme per 1 g of glycogen [57, 59]).
the affinity of apoenzyme to glycogen is 5fold lower
than the affinity of holoenzyme to this ligand (fig. 4a)
[57, 59]. as shown in table 2, the affinity of apophb for
fmn is 35fold lower than the affinity of holoenzyme to
this ligand. the data presented show that the removal of

the cofactor causes structural rearrangements in the phb
molecule, in particular, in the contact area of monomers
in a dimer, in the region of the glycogen storage site, and
in the region of the allosteric inhibitor site. some addi
tional data, testifying to differences in the structure of
holo and apophb, were obtained using hydrogen–tri
tium exchange method [60] and modification of sh
groups [61]. the reconstruction of holoenzyme from
apoenzyme and plp causes the restoration of phosphory
lase affinity for glycogen (fig. 4b) and for fmn (table 2).
the analytical ultracentrifugation study of transi
tions on the level of quaternary structure and affinity for
several ligand (glycogen and fmn) with the enzyme
reconstructed with plp analogs modified in 5′position
of the cofactor, allowed us to obtain some additional data
concerning the role of plp in phosphorylase as a confor
mational cofactor [57, 59]. the analogs studied con
tained the following substituents in 5′position instead of

would be expected, the forms of the enzyme reconstruct

forms differed significantly from the apoenzyme and the

[53]. at 17°c the association constant, kass, for the native
phb is equal to 2.4·104 m–1 (table 3) [62]. the values of
kass for the native phb and for phb reconstructed with
plp are not different from each other. for the enzyme
reconstructed with analogs i, ii, and iii, the equilibrium
→ tetramer is strongly shifted toward the for
dimer ←
mation of the tetrameric form (table 3) [57]. the nature
of the substituents in the 5′position has practically no
influence on the affinity of phb for glycogen [57, 59]. we
observed an absolutely different picture for binding of the
allosteric inhibitor, fmn. as shown in table 2, the affin
ity of the enzyme reconstructed with analogs i, ii, and iii
for fmn is noticeably lower than that for the native
enzyme for this effector, with analog iii being as low as
for apoenzyme.
all these data indicate that plp plays an important
role in maintaining the quaternary structure and particu
lar conformation of the enzyme, important for the inter
action with the substrate and allosteric inhibitors.
thermal stability of holoenzyme, apoenzyme, and
enzyme reduced by sodium borohydride. one of the most
important physicochemical characteristics of proteins is
their stability at elevated temperatures. first the decrease
in thermal stability of apophb as compared to the holoen
 xxxg1282xxx  was discovered by hedrick et al. [39]. these authors
showed that holophb is completely inactivated after
60min incubation at 55°c, whereas the apoenzyme loses
its ability for the restoration of the activity under the
reconstruction with plp after 60min incubation at 45°c.

apophb, and phb reduced by nabh4 has been studied in

detail [6366]. the data presented showed that thermal
denaturation proceeds according to a dissociative mecha
nism, i.e., includes a step of reverse dissociation of the
dimer into the monomers with subsequent irreversible
denaturation of the monomers. to characterize the role of
cofactor of phb, plp, in sustaining the native conforma
tion of the enzyme, the authors carried out a comparative
analysis of thermal stability of the native phb (holoform)
and its apoform using differential scanning calorimetry
(dsc). as can be seen from fig. 5, a maximum on the
excess heat capacity ∆cp versus temperature profile for
the apoform of phb (48°c) is shifted markedly toward
lower temperatures in comparison with that for the holo
form (56.8°c). thermal stability of the plpreconstruct
ed enzyme (curve 3) is practically identical to that for the
native enzyme. as mentioned above, the removal of plp
from phb results in dissociation of the dimeric form into
monomers [39, 58, 67]. therefore, one can assume that
the main reason for the lesser stability of the apoform of
the enzyme is its easy transformation into the monomer
form. nevertheless, it is evident that plp has a general
stabilizing effect on the native phb.
the study of thermal stability of phb reduced by
sodium borohydride gives an additional verification of
plp participation in stabilization of the native conforma
tion of phb. as seen from fig. 6, thermal inactivation of
phb reduced by sodium borohydride proceeds much
faster in comparison with the native enzyme. in both

cases thermal inactivation is accelerated under dilution of
the enzyme, i.e., it is believed that for the reduced
enzyme it proceeds according to the dissociative mecha
nism, as for the native enzyme. a second circumstance
which is worth mentioning is that if at the high concen
tration of the enzyme (5.2 mg/ml) at the initial part of the
curve of thermal inactivation of the native enzyme a well
pronounced lag period occurs, no lag period occurs on
the corresponding curve for the reduced phb. the lag
period on the curve of thermal inactivation is connected
with the presence of the step of predenaturational confor
mational changes in the dimer [63, 65]. thus, the absence
of lag period on the curve of thermal inactivation for the
reduced form of phb is a significant indication that dur
ing denaturation of this form the step of predenatura
tional conformational changes could be neglected. it is
known that reduction of phb by sodium borohydride
causes substantial weakening of the intersubunit contacts
in the dimer. therefore, the reduced phb partially disso
ciates into monomers at the relatively low concentrations
of the enzyme (0.01 mg/ml) [67].
sedimentation analysis of nabh4reduced phb
(0.92 mg/ml) at 53°c indicates that the reduced enzyme
moves as an unfolded monomer (s20,w = 3.6 s), whereas the
native enzyme at the same temperature and protein con
centration sediments mainly as a dimeric form [62]. thus,
at elevated temperatures nabh4reduced phb dissociates
into monomers more easily than the native enzyme.
the lower thermal stability of sodium borohydride
reduced phb, as compared to the native enzyme, was also
supported by dsc data. as can be seen from fig. 7, the
maximum on the ∆cp versus temperature profile for the
reduced form of phb occurs at 54.2°c, i.e., at a lower
temperature than for the native enzyme (56.8°c).
stability of holoenzyme and enzyme reduced by sodi
um borohydride relative to guanidine hydrochloride
(guhcl). the data on phb denaturation in the presence
of guhcl are also indicative of the lower stability of the
bonds between the subunits in the dimer after reduction
by sodium borohydride. dissociation into monomers in
the case of reduced phb occurs under lower concentra
tion of guhcl as compared to the native enzyme.
according to the data of analytical ultracentrifugation,
after incubation with 0.2 m guhcl for 2 h the native
enzyme remains in the dimeric form (20°c, ph 6.8;
0.4 mg/ml of phb) but 30% of the reduced enzyme exists
under the same conditions as a monomer. the fact that
the character of the curves of inactivation of the native
phb and phb reduced with nabh4 changes upon the
variation of the protein concentration points to the dis
sociative mechanism of the unfolding of the protein
molecule ([68], chebotareva, eronina, unpublished
results).
summing up of the preceding it is possible to con
clude that plp taking part in the catalysis and being a
conformational cofactor of phb plays a key role in the

pyridoxal 5′phosphate in glycogen phosphorylase
functioning of this enzyme. since mammalian muscle
contains phosphorylase in relatively high concentrations
(approximately 30 mg per 100 ml of intracellular fluid),
and since muscle tissue makes up 40% of the body mass,
it is not difficult to calculate that more plp is bound to
muscle phosphorylase than is present in all other pyridox
al phosphatedependent enzymes together [33].
now it is possible to consider that the mechanism of
participation of plp in the reaction catalyzed by phos
phorylase is revealed. it was established that the main cat
alytic group of plp functioning as a donor–acceptor of a
proton according to general scheme of acid–base cataly
sis is the phosphate group in 5′position. it is important to
note that phosphorylase is a glucosyl but not a phospho
ryltransferase.
the direct participation of plp in catalysis is
accompanied by its role as a conformational cofactor of
phosphorylase, stabilizing the active dimeric structure of
the enzyme and regulating the affinity of phb to the sub
strates and effectors.
