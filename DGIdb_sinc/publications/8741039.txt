atypical vitamin b12-unresponsive
methylmalonic aciduria
in a sibship with severe progressive
encephalomyelopathy:
a new genetic disease?

abstract we report on two siblings,
a girl of 7 years and a boy of 2 years,
who presented in infancy with hypotonia, athetoid movements, myopathy and severe developmental delay.
the progressive clinical course was
characterized by ophthalmoplegia,
pyramidal tract signs, loss of visual
contact and failure to thrive. the
older sister died at the age of 7 years.
the younger brother followed an almost identical clinical course. m r i
of the brain revealed bilateral hypodensities and atrophy of the putamen. neurophysiological investigations were consistent with peripheral
neuropathy. investigations for neurometabolic disorders in urine,
plasma and csf of both patients
revealed a consistent increase of
methylmalonic acid in urine, plasma
and csf as well as borderline low
free g a b a in cse except for an inconstant elevation of lactate in the
boy, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, episodic ketoacidosis, or hyperammonaemia, the usual concomitants of organoacidopathies, were absent in both children. homocystinuria was excluded. methylmalonic
aciduria did not respond to antibiotic

introduction
methylmalonic acid is derived from  xxxd3029xxx  as part
of the catabolic pathways of isoleucine, valine, threonine,
methionine, thymine, cholesterol, and odd-chain  xxxd2154xxx 

treatment, vitamin bi2 therapy nor
dietary protein restriction. incorporation of [14c]propionate into protein
in cultured fibroblasts was pathologically but inconsistently decreased.
both patients' cell lines showed only
minimal response to  xxxd2300xxx  and normal methylmalonylcoa mutase activity.

methylmalonic aciduria consists of a group of clinically and biochemically distinct disorders resulting from a
block in the conversion of methylmalonyl coa to succinyl
coa. about half of the reported patients with methylmalonic aciduria have a deficiency of the mutase apoenzyme (mut ~ or mut-) [4, 5]. in the remaining patients with
isolated methylmalonic aciduria the defect resides in the
formation of the coenzyme ado-cbl. while in patients
with the mut ~ defect methylmalonic aciduria is not responsive to  xxxd2716xxx  12, vitamin b12 supplementation may
decrease the accumulation of methylmalonate in patients
with the mut- and cbl a or cbl b defects and therefore
serves as a valuable therapeutic approach [4, 5].
the main clinical manifestations in patients with methylmalonic aciduria are lethargy, failure to thrive, recurrent
vomiting, dehydration, hepatomegaly, respiratory distress,
muscular hypotonia, developmental retardation, and coma
[5, 15]. the most frequent laboratory findings include
metabolic acidosis, ketonaemia and ketonuria, hyperammonaemia, elevated glycine and lysine in plasma and
urine as well as leuco- and thrombopenia during acute
episodes [5, 15].
we report on studies in two siblings with methylmalonic
aciduria not responding to antibiotic treatment, vitamin
b12 supplementation or dietary protein restriction. both
children were clinically severely affected with profound
developmental retardation and progressive neurological
manifestations. there were no other abnormal laboratory
findings with the exception of slightly reduced levels of
free 7- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) in csf. despite detailed investigations of methylmalonate and cobalamin
metabolism in cultured fibroblasts the definitive underlying enzymatic defect remains unclear suggesting a hitherto unrecognized genetic neurometabolic disorder.

case reports
case 1
the female patient was the second of three children of non-consanguineous parents of southern italian origin. there is one older
healthy sibling showing no increased methylmalonate excretion in
urine. pregnancy and birth were uncomplicated. birth weight was
3090 g, length 51 cm, head circumference 34 cm. at 3 months of
age muscular hypotonia and athetoid movements were noted. retardation of gross motor development and developmental delay became apparent. sitting or walking was never achieved and the clinical course was slowly progressive. there was no language development and poor social, contact. convulsions never occurred. at
the age of 6 years the girl was transferred to our metabolic unit because of methylmalonic aciduria. length was 105 cm (< 3rd percentile), weight was 12.2 kg (< 3 rd percentile), head circumference was 48 cm (< 3 rd percentile) (fig. 2a).
facies myopathica plus ophthalmoplegia were noticed. psychomotor development was grossly retarded. the girl showed
pyramidal tract signs, spasticity tonus, athetoid movements, no visual contact and no head control. there was no hepatosplenomegaly. fundoscopy was normal. there were no signs of hearing
impairment. eeg and ecg including echocardiography showed
no pathological findings. neurophysiological investigations revealed peripheral neuropathy. a muscle biopsy revealed inconclusive results uncontributary to diagnosis. mri of the brain showed
bilateral hypodensities and atrophy of the putamen (fig. 2b). additionally, marked atrophy particularly of the frontal and parietotemporal areas could be seen. the child died at the age of 7 years.
no autopsy was performed.

case 2
this patient is the younger brother of case 1. pregnancy and birth
were uncomplicated. birth weight was 3270 g, length 52 cm, head
circumference 37 cm. shortly after birth muscular hypotonia became apparent. during the next months he followed a clinical
course very similar to that of his sister with progressive athetoid
movements and developmental delay. we first saw the patient at
the age of 7 months (fig. 3a).

his weight was 7540 g (= 10th percentile), length 70 cm (= 25th
percentile) and head circumference 42 cm (< 3rd percentile). he
showed athetoid movements, severe muscular hypotonia and developmental delay. ptosis, strabismus divergens and pyramidal
tract signs were present. there was poor social contact, no visual
contact and no head control. there was no hepatosplenomegaly.
fundoscopy was normal as were repeated eeg, e c g and
echocardiographic investigations. neurophysiological examination showed signs of periphereal neuropathy. mri of the brain revealed bilateral hypodensities and atrophy of the putamen as in his
older sister, but at the age of 7 months less prominent (fig. 3b). a t
the present age of 2 years these bilateral lesions have become more
prominent (fig. 3c). in addition, enlargement of the ventricular
systems suggesting more widespread atrophy.
laboratory parameters of liver and kidney function including
electrolytes were always within normal limits. haemoglobin lev-

els, blood cell counts and erythrocyte indices were also normal in
both children. metabolic acidosis, hypoglycaemia, episodic ketoacidosis and hyperammonaemia were always absent in both children. lysosomal disorders were excluded. in the younger brother
an inconstant elevation of plasma lactate levels during the first 2
years of life was noted (values ranging from 1.0-6.3 mmol/1). lactate/pyruvate ratios were slightly increased on some occasions
(9.8-23.6). in the first patient lactate levels were always found to
be normal. permission for a muscle biopsy in the boy could not be
obtained.
isoelectric focussing of serum sialotransferrins resulted in a
normal pattern (j. jaeken, leuven, belgium): plasma very longchain  xxxd2154xxx , long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  as well as urinary
leukotriene e 4 excretion were normal. in both patients, chromosomal analysis, also using high resolution techniques, did not show
numerical or structural aberrations.

methods
analysis and quantification of methylmalonate in urine
was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) as previously described in detail [8, 17].
methylmalonate levels in plasma and csf were quantified by a specific stable isotope dilution gc-ms assay [11].
total and free g a b a were measured in csf by a stable isotope dilution gc-ms method as described in detail
elsewhere [13].
fibroblasts were routinely cultured in m e m (eagle's
minimal essential medium) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum, 2 mmol/1 glutamine and antibiotica-antimycotica mixture.
the incorporation of label from [~4c]propionate into
trichloroacetic acid precipitable protein was measured in
intact fibroblasts, cultured with and without  xxxd2300xxx  ( xxxd2300xxx , 1 gg/ml medium) as described [18],
except that the concentration of propionate in the incubation medium was 0.2 mmol/1.
 xxxg1485xxx  activity in fibroblasts was
determined after culturing the fibroblasts in the presence
of  xxxd2300xxx  (1.0 gg/ml). the enzyme assay was performed
in homogenized fibroblasts with (total mutase activity)
and without (holomutase activity) addition of ado-cbl (5 •
10-5 mol/1) in the assay mixture [3].

results
urinary screening for organic acids consistently revealed
methylmalonic aciduria in both patients. table 1 summarizes methylmalonate levels in urine, plasma and csf,
which were always moderately elevated in both children.

methylmalonic aciduria did not respond to  xxxd2716xxx  12
therapy (up to 5 mg  xxxd2300xxx  i.m./day for 14 days). in case
2 different degrees of protein restriction from 1.4 to 0.8
g/kg natural protein per day supplemented with precursor
free amino acid mixture was without any influence on the
levels of methylmalonate in urine, plasma nor csf.
antibiotic treatment with colistine which inhibits
colonic flora also showed no effect on increased methylmalonate excretion in urine.
amino acids in plasma and urine, odd-chain fatty
acids, plasma carnitine and  xxxd2716xxx  n levels (694 and
713 mol/l, respectively) were within normal limits. in particular, homocystine and formiminoglutamic acid were
not detectable (m. duran and l. dorland, utrecht, the
netherlands). in case 2 transcobalamins and cobalamins
occurred in plasma in concentrations within the interval of
reference (e. nexo, aarhus, denmark).
free g a b a levels in csf in case 1 (age 6 years 0.032
gm; controls (n = 15; > 2 years): 0.029-0.142 gm) and in
case 2 (age 7 months 0.0i2 gm; controls (n = 15; < 2
years): 0.017-0.065 gm, and age 2 years 0.020 gm; controls (n = 15; > 2 years): 0.029-0.142 btm) were borderline low. total g a b a concentration in csf was within
normal ranges in both cases (case 1 9.39 gm; case 2 12.10
g m and 9.80 gm; controls (n = 15; > 2 years): 4.1-13.4
gm).
results of [14c]propionate incorporation in intact fibroblasts from patients and controls are given in table 2.
in case 1 incorporation of [i4c]propionate was normal,
whereas in case 2 incorporation of [14c]propionate into
protein was decreased in two separate experiments. aithough these cells grew poorly the low [14c]propionate/
[3h]phenylalanine ratio is consistent with specific impairment of propionate metabolism. in both cell lines [14c]propionate incorporation showed no significant response to
supplementation of the medium with  xxxd2300xxx  (1 ~tg/ml).
the obtained results of propionate incorporation in fibroblasts in both patients were subsequently confirmed by
d.s. rosenblatt, montreal, quebec, canada. values of
propionate fixation were comparable to those reported in
table 2; i.e. they were pathologically decreased in both
children.
results of  xxxg1485xxx  activity measurements in fibroblasts revealed normal activities of holomutase (case 1 336, case 2 246, controls (n = 18): 337/110-

additional studies performed in fibroblasts of the siblings including incorporation of [14c]methyltetrahydrofolate as well as uptake and formation of vitamin b12 were
also within control ranges (d. s. rosenblatt, montreal,
quebec, canada).

discussion
our patients differ from classical methylmalonic aciduria
with respect to both clinical and biochemical findings.
recurrent vomiting, dehydration, respiratory distress, hepatomegaly, and coma, as well as biochemical findings
characteristic of defects in the metabolism of methylmalonate such as metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia,
hyperglycinuria, carnitine deficiency or haematological
abnormalities never occurred. even though methylmalonic
acid was consistently elevated in both patients (by more
than a factor of 100 upper control range in urine) (table
1), it was considerably lower than in patients with classical methylmalonic aciduria due to a deficiency of the mutase apoenzyme (mut ~ or muv). in such patients metabolite levels usually range around 1000 up to 20000 mmol/
mol of creatinine in urine, 10-200 gmol/1 in plasma and
100-350 btmol/1 in csf (g.f. hoffmann, unpublished observations).
in general, patients with inborn errors of vitamin b12
metabolism may have either methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, or both, depending on whether the synthesis
of one or both coenzymes is impaired (fig. 1) [4]. homocystinuria was excluded in both patients. incorporation of
[14c]propionate in the girl was low normal, whereas it was
reduced in the boy's fibroblasts and was not stimulated by
 xxxd2300xxx  added to the culture medium. this excludes diminished propionate incorporation being the result either
of deficient ado-cbl synthesis or of a decreased affinity
of the apoenzyme for its coenzyme (mut-- defect) [ 14]. excretion of methylmalonic acid in both patients did not respond to repeated high dose vitamin b12 therapy i.m. nor,
unexpectively, to protein restriction. furthermore neither
approach appeared to have any positive effect on the clinical picture, even after periods of up to 6 months. the unresponsiveness to vitamin b12 therapy is in agreement
with the results of the enzyme assays in cultured fibroblasts, whereas the lack of response to dietary manipulations cannot be easily explained.
since gut bacteria have been implicated as an important source of propionate in children with inborn errors of
propionate metabolism [2], we investigated the value of
antibiotic therapy. however, during antibiotic treatment
methylmalonic aciduria and the clinical picture remained
unchainged.

in the boy, but not in his sister, we found inconstant elevations of plasma lactate. since a muscle biopsy in the
boy was refused, we cannot totally exclude a defect of the
respiratory chain in this patient. however, because of the
similar course in his sister in whom plasma lactate was always found to be normal, we assume that this might be a
secondary phenomenon.
borderline low levels of free gaba in csf were
demonstrated especially in the boy. the mechanisms leading to this biochemical abnormality remain speculative,
but these findings are almost secondary to the primary underlying defect. the contention that these findings are
secondary are also supported by the fact that low levels of
free gaba in the same range as in this sibship have been
found in a significant proportion of patients with ill defined severe neurological disease in childhood (g.f. hoffmann, heidelberg, germany; j. jaeken, leuven, belgium;
and r. surtees, london, uk, unpublished observations).
both patients suffered from a very distinctive progressive neurometabolic disease involving several different
functional systems of the brain. the clinical course was
characterized by severe failure to thrive, developmental
delay, myopathy, hypotonia, ophthalmoplegia, toss of visual contact, athetoid movements, and pyramidal tract
signs. neurophysiological examination revealed a periphereal neuropathy and mri bilateral hypodensities and atrophy of the putamen as well as generalised atrophy (fig.
3). although these findings are common in inherited
metabolic disorders, they have been particularly reported
in patients with methylmalonic aciduria, where the lesions
are generally found in the pallidum [1, 16]. patients with
propionic acidaemia surving beyond infancy have also
shown abnormalities primarily involving the basal ganglia
[7]. these changes have consisted of varying degrees of
neuronal loss and gliosis including acute symmetric
necrosis of the caudate, globus pallidus, and putamen [6].
this demonstrates an immate vulnerability of the basal
ganglia in disorders of propionate metabolism with the
development of hypodense areas in the basal ganglia following severe illness. even the natural history of these
episodes seems to be different from those described in our
patients, the neuropathological changes, however, were
similar to those found in propionic acidaemia and methylmalonic aciduria.
the unique and characteristic clinical and biochemical
picture in the described sibship suggests a hitherto unrecognized genetic disorder. the occurrence in both sexes
with unaffected parents and one healthy sibling is suggestive of an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. as the
underlying enzymatic defect and the biochemical mechanism for the accumulation of methylmalonic acid in our
sibship remains to be clarified, this report illustrates that
hitherto undescribed metabolic disorders remain to be elucidated even in long investigated areas of intermediary
metabolism such as methylmalonic aciduria. detailed
metabolic investigations should be performed in patients

403

with obscure encephalomyelopathies which will certainly
reveal a number of hitherto undescribed metabolic disorders [9, 10, 12].
