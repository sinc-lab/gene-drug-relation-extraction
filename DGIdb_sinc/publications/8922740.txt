langerhans: implications for stimulus-response coupling of
insulin release

1 microfluorimetry techniques with fura-2 were used to characterize the effects of efaroxan (200 pm),
 xxxd2914xxx  (200-500 gm) and idazoxan (200-500 ,m) on the intracellular free ca2+ concentration
([ca2 ]+) in mouse isolated islets of langerhans.
2 the imidazoline receptor agonists efaroxan and  xxxd2914xxx  consistently elevated cytosolic ca2+ by
mechanisms that were dependent upon ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane; there was no rise in
[ca2+]1 when ca2+ was removed from outside of the islets and  xxxd1868xxx  (100-250 gm) attenuated the
responses.

3 modulation of cytosolic [ca2+]i by efaroxan and  xxxd2914xxx  was augmented by glucose (510 mm) which both potentiated the magnitude of the response and reduced the onset time of
imidazoline-induced rises in [ca2+],.
4 efaroxan- and  xxxd2914xxx -evoked increases in [ca2+], were unaffected by overnight pretreatment
of islets with the imidazolines. idazoxan failed to increase [ca2+], under any experimental condition
tested.
5 the putative endogenous ligand of imidazoline receptors,  xxxd94xxx  (1 gm -1 mm), blocked katp
channels in isolated patches of f-cell membrane, but effects upon [ca2+], could not be further
investigated since  xxxd94xxx  disrupts fura-2 fluorescence.
6 in conclusion, the present study shows that imidazolines will evoke rises in [ca2 +] in intact islets, and
this provides an explanation to account for the previously described effects of imidazolines on katp
channels, the cell membrane potential and insulin secretion in pancreatic f-cells.

introduction

methods

the pharmacological manipulation of atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channels in insulin-secreting cells has important implications for our understanding of stimulusresponse coupling events. these channels establish the resting
cell membrane potential in #-cells, and close following glucose
metabolism to initiate a depolarization of the cell, voltagegated ca2" influx and insulin secretion (see dunne & petersen,
1991). katp channels are inhibited by sulphonylureas, such as
 xxxd3394xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx , which mimic the effects of
glucose stimulation and initiate insulin secretion (see ashcroft
& ashcroft, 1992). conversely, agonists of katp channels such
as  xxxd1868xxx , inhibit insulin release by hyperpolarizing the
membrane potential and preventing the influx of ca2+ by
voltage-dependent events (dunne & petersen, 1991).
certain imidazoline derivatives such as the i, agonist efaroxan and the i1/i2 agonist  xxxd2914xxx  are also insulin secretagogues (ahren & lundquist, 1985; schulz & hasselblatt,
1989) and inhibitors of atp-sensitive potassium channels
(plant & henquin, 1990; chan et al., 1991; dunne, 1991; jonas
et al., 1992). the underlying mechanisms responsible for the
link(s) between electrical activity and insulin release are incompletely understood. indeed, the 12 agonist idazoxan inhibits katp channels (chan et al., 1991), but does not promote
secretion of insulin (chan & morgan, 1990; chan et al., 1991).
in this study we examined the effects of  xxxd2914xxx , efaroxan,  xxxd3394xxx  and idazoxan, on cytosolic ca2+ homeostasis in intact glucose-responsive islets of langerhans of the

microfluorimetry with fura-2 was used to monitor
changes in cytosolic ca2+ levels (grynkiewicz et al., 1985).
mouse islets were prepared by use of established methods
(gilon & henquin, 1992). briefly, pancreata from five mf1
mice were washed and finely minced with scissors in a krebs
solution containing (mm): nacl 120, kcl 4.8, cacl2 2.5,
mgcl2 1.2, nahco3 24, 4-(2-hydroxyethoyl)-1-piperazineethane-sulphonic acid (hepes) 5 and glucose 10. the
medium was gassed for 20 min with 95% 02/5% co2 and
the ph set to 7.35 with naoh. bovine  xxxg124xxx  was
then added at 1 mg 1 ml-'. islets were liberated from the
pancreas first by collagenase digestion (7 mg, serva collagenase, basle, switzerland) for 7-12 min at 37°c and,
then by microdissection to prevent damage of the islet cell
capsule. whole islets were cultured for between 18 and 72 h
in rpmi 1640 medium (gibco, uk) supplemented with
10% foetal calf serum, and 100 u/0.1 mg per ml penicillin/
streptomycin, respectively, on poly-d-lysine (50 jug ml-')
treated coverslips. the islets were loaded with 0.5 mm fura-2am (sigma) in 1 ml of rpmi 1640 medium for 8 min at
37°c. the composition of basic perifusion medium was
(mm): nacl 137, kcl 5.36,  xxxd2534xxx  0.81, na2po4 0.34,
kh2po4 0.44, nahco3 4.17, hepes 10 and cacl2 1.26.
this medium was gassed with air for 20 min, glucose was
added as 2.02 mm and ph set to 7.4 with naoh. for
studies involving the removal of external ca2 , cacl2 was
omitted and 1 mm ethylenebis-(oxonitrilo) tetraacetate
(egta) added (squires et al., 1994). all experiments were
carried out at 37°c. for electrophysiology and microfluorimetry studies of isolated fl-cells, tissue was prepared as
previously described (findlay et al., 1985). single katp

channel currents were recorded by use of patch-clamp
techniques (hamill et al., 1981) at 0 mv voltage-clamp with
the cell-free inside-out patch configuration with a na+-rich
solution in the pipette; composition (mm): nacl 140, kcl
4.7, mgcl2 1.13, glucose 2.5, hepes 10 and cacl2 2.5 (ph
7.4) and a k+-rich solution in the bath; composition (mm):
kcl 140, nacl 10, mgcl2 1.13, glucose 2.5, hepes 10 and
egta 1 (ph 7.2) (lebrun et al., 1996). for experiments
involving down-regulation of imidazoline receptors, procedures were followed from chan et al. (1993). all compounds
were added to the medium from dimethylsulphoxide stocks;
 xxxd3394xxx  100 gim, thapsigargin 100 mm or from distilled
water stocks of efaroxan 200 mm, idazoxan 500 mm (sigma).  xxxd2914xxx  myslate ( xxxd2914xxx , ciba, switzerland)
was added as a saline stock solution.

quantification of data
microfluorimetry; (i) an in vitro calibration procedure
(grynkiewicz et al., 1985) was used to estimate changes in
[ca2 + ],, (ii) basal values of [ca2+]i were estimated in the
presence of 2 mm glucose, (iii) peak changes in cytosolic
ca2 + (a[ca2+]it) are presented as the difference between
basal [ca2+]i and the mean rise in [ca2 + ]i, (iii) 'tba,al' - time
in seconds from the point of removal of an agonist to the
return to basal ca2+, and (iv) 'ti/2 onset' - time in seconds
from application of an agonist to the attainment of half the
mean rise in [ca2+]j. electrophysiology; changes in katp
channel open-state probability were estimated by published
procedures (dunne, 1991; lebrun et al., 1996).

results

imidazoline-evoked changes in cytosolic ca2"
islets of langerhans were isolated on 14 occasions from batches
of 5 mice. the mean basal cytosolic calcium level was established
to be 57 + 3 nm (n = 92) (mean + s.e.mean). figures 1, 2 and
table 1 summarise the responsiveness of isolated islets to a
number of agonists. glucose (10 mm, n = 12 and 15 mm, n = 1 1)
typically induced a rise in the free cytosolic ca2+ concentration
([ca2 + ],) that was associated with fast oscillations, on top of slow
waves of cytosolic ca2 , superimposed upon a plateau of elevated [ca2+], (figure 1). quantitatively, in the presence of 2 mm
glucose the responses of the islets to efaroxan (200 tm, n = 7) and
 xxxd3394xxx  (100 gim, n = 6) were similar; both elevated [ca2+],
in a readily reversible manner and each initiated the appearance
of fast ca2+ oscillations on a number of occasions (figure 2 and
table 1).  xxxd2914xxx  (500 igm, n = 5), on the other hand,
produced a rise in [ca2+]i that was comparable in magnitude
with the other agonists, but the time-course of the response was
markedly different with a long delay in both the onset and reversibility times (figure 2, table 1). at lower concentrations
efaroxan was also effective (dunne et al., 1995), but there were
no actions of  xxxd2914xxx  on [ca2+]i at concentrations
< 500 tim (n = 6). idazoxan (200- 500 gim) failed to evoke any
significant increase in [ca2+ ], (figure 2, n = 7).

[ca2i]i and imidazolines in #-cells

were pre-exposed to a ca2+-free medium and the agonist added, (ii) external ca2" was acutely removed during an agonistinduced rise in cytosolic ca2", (iii) interactions between agonists and the  xxxg1253xxx  activator  xxxd1868xxx  were studied,
and (iv) effects were examined in combination with the intracellular ca2" atpase inhibitor thapsigargin.

our findings show that in the absence of external ca2+
neither efaroxan (n=4, figure 3a) nor  xxxd2914xxx  (n=6,
figure 3b) were able to initiate a rise in [ca2+]i and that acute
removal of external ca2" in the presence of either agonist
completely attenuated the responses (efaroxan (n=5),  xxxd2914xxx  (n = 6), figure 3). the  xxxg1253xxx  opener  xxxd1868xxx 
was used to investigate the involvement of voltage-dependent
ca2" influx since it produces a hyperpolarization of the cell
membrane potential and inhibits glucose-induced ca2" responses (dunne et al., 1990). in the presence of 250 gm  xxxd1868xxx  there was little effect of either efaroxan or  xxxd2914xxx 
on [ca2+], (n = 7/10), and  xxxd1868xxx  attenuated agonist-induced
rises in cytosolic ca2+ (n =9, figure 3b). however, when the
 xxxd1868xxx  concentration was lowered to 100 pm, both  xxxd2914xxx  and efaroxan increased [ca2+], (figure 4), despite the
fact that the responses were generally smaller and the time of
onset considerably slower (table 1). finally, the involvement of
ca2+ release from cytoplasmic ca2+ stores was studied by examining the effects of efarozan in the presence of thapsigargin,
which failed to prevent agonist-evoked increases in [ca2+],
(n= 5, not shown).

when the responses of islets to efaroxan and  xxxd2914xxx 
were studied in the presence of 5- 10 mm glucose, two predominant effects were noted; first the magnitude of the imidazoline-induced rise in [ca2+]1 was enhanced, and secondly
there was a marked decrease in the onset time of the cytosolic
ca2+ rise (efaroxan n = 6,  xxxd2914xxx , n = 11, figure 5, table 1). these effects are consistent with glucose causing an
augmentation of the imidazoline-induced rise in [ca2+]i.

receptor down-regulation
the actions of the imidazoline agonists efaroxan and  xxxd2914xxx  can be down-regulated by long-term exposure of insulin-secreting cells to the agonists (chan et al., 1993). table 2
and figure 6 show a summary of the findings related to imidazoline receptor down-regulation on [ca2+], signalling. preexposure of islets to either  xxxd2914xxx  or efaroxan for 18 h
at 50 pm, 200 gm and 500 gm did not significantly impair
ca21 signalling events in response to  xxxd2914xxx , efaroxan,
 xxxd3394xxx  or glucose.

effects of  xxxd94xxx  on ion channels and ca2" signalling
in f-cells

 xxxd94xxx  has been suggested to be the endogenous agonist for
imidazoline receptors (li et al., 1994). as  xxxd94xxx  will promote insulin release from f-cells (sener et al., 1989) we in-

representative of 6 islets.

[ca2j] and imidazolines in #-cells
vestigated the mechanisms underlying this effect. by use of
patch-clamp techniques we found that  xxxd94xxx  directly inhibits katp channels in a concentration-dependent manner,
and that the effects are sustained and reversible (n= 7, figure
7). however, the actions of  xxxd94xxx  on [ca2+]i homeostasis
could not be fully assessed since in f-cells  xxxd94xxx  interferes
with the fluorescence of fura-2 (n = 6) (figure 8).

discussion
the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
imidazolines on cytosolic ca2+ signalling events in pancreatic
islets of langerhans. many of these compounds are insulin
secretagogues that facilitate their action through modulation
of k+ channels. however, the subcellular signalling events
involving these compounds are incompletely resolved. we have
previously shown that there is no accumulation of intracellular
adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate ( xxxd1773xxx ) levels resulting from exposure of f-cells to imidazolines (chan et al.,
1991), but the involvement of [ca2+]i homeostasis has not been
thoroughly investigated (rustenbeck et al., 1995). overall our
data show that  xxxd2914xxx  and efaroxan elevate cytosolic
ca21 levels in islets, and that this could explain how the
compounds promote insulin secretion following k+ channel
modulation.
in p-cells, glucose-induced insulin secretion is a ca2+ dependent process involving the influx of ca2+ across the plasma
membrane (wollheim & sharp, 1981). calcium-selective ion
channels in #-cells are predominantly voltage-operated, and
open upon a depolarization of the cell membrane potential.
this depolarization is facilitated by closure of katp channels
which occurs following glucose metabolism and a concomitant
rise in the  xxxd83xxx : xxxd80xxx 
(atp:adp) ratio (ashcroft et al., 1984; dunne & petersen,
1991). katp channels are also inhibited by the antidiabetic
sulphonylureas which depolarize the cell membrane, elevate
cytosolic ca2+ and promote the release of insulin (ashcroft &
ashcroft, 1992). by contrast, rather less is known about the
stimulus-response coupling events involving imidazolines in ficells. efaroxan,  xxxd2914xxx  and idazoxan are blockers of
katp channels, and whilst efaroxan and  xxxd2914xxx  will
depolarize the #-cell membrane potential (plant & henquin,
1990; dunne, 1991; dunne & petersen, 1991) and promote
insulin secretion (schulz & hasselblatt, 1989), idazoxan will

stimulation of ,b-cell purinoceptor elevates [ca2 +]i (squires et al.,
1994),  xxxd94xxx  had a deleterious effect on fura-2. unlike atp which
causes a decrease in 380nm fluorescence and a concomitant rise at
350nm,  xxxd94xxx  increases the fluorescence at both wavelengths.

not (chan & morgan, 1990). in this study we show that both
 xxxd2914xxx  and efaroxan are able to effect a marked elevation of [ca2+]i in intact islets of langerhans, and that the
subcellular events are critically dependent upon ca2+ influx
and not mobilization of stored ca2"; (i) in the absence of
external ca2+ there is no increase in intracellular ca2", (ii)
acute removal of external ca2+ attenuated agonist-evoked
increases in [ca2+]i, (iii) the hyperpolarizing k+ channel agonist  xxxd1868xxx  attenuated both efaroxan- and phentolamineevoked increases in [ca2+]i and caused a marked delay in the
onset times of the responses, and (iv) imidazoline-mediated
rises in [ca2+ ] were unaffected by the intracellular ca2+atpase inhibitor thapsigargin. the actions of idazoxan on
[ca2+]i are also relevant since in contrast to efaroxan and
 xxxd2914xxx , idazoxan failed to elevate [ca2+], (figure 2)
despite blocking katp channels at much lower concentrations
(chan et al., 1991). since  xxxg1253xxx  inhibition is associated
with a depolarization of the cell membrane potential and the
opening of voltage-gated ca2+ channels, we investigated
whether this inconsistency could be due to a deleterious effect
of idazoxan on the influx of ca2 . voltage-dependent calcium
influx was therefore initiated by exposing islets to high external
kci, and under these conditions we found that idazoxan attenuated the kcl-induced rises in [ca2+]i (n = 3, mean block by
18 + 1% of the control value) suggesting that the compound
could inhibit the entry of ca2+.
interactions between glucose and efaroxan or  xxxd2914xxx , suggest that the imidazolines are able not only to initiate
ca2+ signalling events in fl-cells (figure 2), but that they will
also potentiate the actions of glucose (figure 5). our data
show that not only did glucose facilitate faster onset times for
the actions of both  xxxd2914xxx  and efaroxan (table 1), but
that there was also an increase in the magnitude of the ca2+
response. these effects were also seen in islets that themselves
did not respond to 5 mm glucose through a rise in [ca2+],
(figure 5a). the effects of glucose availability upon  xxxd2914xxx -induced rises in [ca21], were significant. in the presence
of 2 mm glucose the mean time for  xxxd2914xxx  to initiate a
rise in [ca2+]1 was approximately 20 min. this is not related to
the solubility of the compound in aqueous solution, since the
onset time in the presence of 5 mm glucose was 8 min, and
3 min  xxxd1891xxx  mm glucose, table 1. one possible explanation for
these findings is that the actions of the imidazoline are augmented in a metabolically-dependent manner through modulation of katp channels (dunne et al., 1995).
efaroxan, idazoxan and  xxxd2914xxx  are all imidazoline
derivatives with differing affinities for the two broad classes of
imidazoline receptors: efaroxan is an i ligand, idazoxan an i2
agonist and  xxxd2914xxx  will interact with both i and 12
receptors (michel & insel, 1989; michel & ernsberger, 1992).
in fl-cells the putative imidazoline receptor has many features
in common with the i and 12 receptor subtypes, but has
properties that distinguish it from these receptors (chan et al.,
1994; olmos et al., 1994; for recent review see morgan et al.,

[ca2,1i and imidazolines in f-cells

915

1995). li and colleagues (1994) recently showed that  xxxd94xxx 
is a component of the 'endogenous ligand' for imidazoline
receptors.  xxxd94xxx  is also an insulin secretagogue (sener et
al., 1989), and in this study we have been able to show that
 xxxd94xxx , like efaroxan and  xxxd2914xxx  will block katp
channels (figure 7). however, any further examination of the
mechanisms of action of  xxxd94xxx  are hindered by the fact that
 xxxd94xxx  disrupts fura-2 fluorescence associated with ca2+
signalling in pancreatic p-cells (figure 8). surprisingly, this
appears specific to fl-cells, since  xxxd94xxx  will readily induce a
rise in [ca21]i in ntera2-derived neurones (squires et al.,
1996), effects that are dependent upon ca2+ influx (squires &
dunne, unpublished observations).
the insulinotropic actions of imidazoline receptor agonists
on insulin secretion (morgan et al., 1995), fl-cell electrophysiology (dunne et al., 1995) and ca2+ signalling (figure 2),
exhibit little or no desensitization over relatively short periods
of time. by contrast, however, imidazoline-evoked insulin secretion can be inhibited by long-term exposure of islets to the
compounds. these responses are also selective (chan et al.,
1993). thus, pre-incubation of islets to efaroxan or  xxxd2914xxx  prevented subsequent responses of cells to either agent,
but not to glucose or  xxxd1868xxx , whereas islets that were preincubated with idazoxan, responded normally to efaroxan and
 xxxd2914xxx . in this study we find under the same experimental conditions, that there was no inhibition of imidazolineevoked increases in [ca2+], (figure 6, table 2). this may indicate that imidazolines, like sulphonylureas (elliasson et al.,
1996) will also evoke insulin secretion through more distal
exocytotic events (see also westerlund et al., 1996). such a
mechanism would also help to explain the relative inefficiency
of imidazolines to promote rises in [ca2+]i when compared to
the action of the compounds on insulin secretion and ion
channel activity. for example,  xxxd2914xxx  will act as an
insulin secretagogue in perifused intact mouse islets at concentrations of approximately 30 ym (schulz & hassleblatt,
1988) and block katp channels with an ic50 of <20 gm
(dunne et al., 1990), yet an effective increase in [ca2+], can
only be initiated by 500 gm. whilst it is possible that this
discrepancy could be due to differences in technical procedures
(primary cultured islets vs. acutely isolated tissue) and the
limitation of microfluorimetry techniques to detect sub-plasma
membrane levels of [ca2+]j, a direct or modulating effect on
exocytosis of insulin-containing granules independent of
[ca2+], cannot be ruled out. in summary, our data show that
imidazoline agonists are modulators of [ca2+], in pancreatic
islets and we conclude that elevation of [ca2+]i, is predominately mediated through ca21 influx.
