abstract
mirtazapine displayed marked af®nity for cloned, human a2a-adrenergic (ar) receptors at which it blocked noradrenaline (na)induced stimulation of guanosine-5¢-o-(3-[35s]thio)-triphosphate ([35s]-gtpgs) binding. similarly, mirtazapine showed high af®nity
for cloned, human serotonin (5-ht)2c receptors at which it abolished 5-ht-induced phosphoinositide generation.  xxxg831xxx -ar
antagonist properties were revealed in vivo by blockade of uk-14,304-induced antinociception, while antagonist actions at 5-ht2c
receptors were demonstrated by blockade of ro 60 0175-induced penile erections and discriminative stimulus properties.
mirtazapine showed negligible af®nity for 5-ht reuptake sites, in contrast to the selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor, citalopram. in freely
moving rats, in the dorsal hippocampus, frontal cortex (fcx), nucleus accumbens and striatum, citalopram increased dialysate levels
of 5-ht, but not dopamine (da) and na. on the contrary, mirtazapine markedly elevated dialysate levels of na and, in fcx, da,
whereas 5-ht was not affected. citalopram inhibited the ®ring rate of serotonergic neurons in dorsal raphe nucleus, but not of
dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, nor adrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. mirtazapine, in contrast,
enhanced the ®ring rate of dopaminergic and adrenergic, but not serotonergic, neurons. following 2 weeks administration, the
facilitatory in¯uence of mirtazapine upon dialysate levels of da and na versus 5-ht in fcx was maintained, and the in¯uence of
citalopram upon fcx levels of 5-ht versus da and na was also unchanged. moreover, citalopram still inhibited, and mirtazapine still
failed to in¯uence, dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons. in conclusion, in contrast to citalopram, mirtazapine reinforces frontocortical
dopaminergic and corticolimbic adrenergic, but not serotonergic, transmission. these actions re¯ect antagonist properties at a2a-ar
and 5-ht2c receptors.

introduction
currently available antidepressants (broekkamp et al., 1995; murphy
et al., 1995; frazer, 1997) act by restoring the compromised activity
of monoaminergic pathways innervating the frontal cortex (fcx),
hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and other corticolimbic regions
(caldecott-hazard et al., 1991; maes & meltzer, 1995; willner, 1995;
feighner, 1999). nevertheless, the respective signi®cance of
serotonergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms in the
aetiology and management of depressive states remains unclear
(caldecott-hazard et al., 1991; willner, 1995; bremner et al., 1996;
graeff et al., 1996; leonard, 1997). thus, in addition to tricyclic
agents, which inhibit both serotonin (5-ht) and noradrenaline (na)
reuptake, selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitors (ssri), e.g. citalopram,
and selective na reuptake inhibitors, e.g.  xxxd3089xxx , are likewise
clinically effective (sambunaris et al., 1997; burrows et al., 1998;
goodnick & goldstein, 1998). further, many antidepressants elevate

fcx levels of da and, upon long-term administration, enhance
dopaminergic signalling in nucleus accumbens (tanda et al., 1994;
willner, 1995; ainsworth et al., 1998a,b; millan et al., 2000a).
certain `atypical' antidepressants are clinically active despite their
weak in¯uence upon monoamine reuptake (frazer, 1997; sperling &
demling, 1997; sambunaris et al., 1997). in this regard, mirtazapine
(sitsen & zivkov, 1998) has attracted attention because it may
possess an innovative mechanism of activity (de boer & ruigt, 1995;
davis & wilde, 1996; de boer, 1996). thus, mirtazapine enhances
hippocampal adrenergic transmission by blockade of inhibitory  xxxg82xxx  autoreceptors (gobbi et al., 1993; de boer et al., 1996; gobert
et al., 1997, 1998; kawahara et al., 1999). further, mirtazapine has
been proposed to increase hippocampal levels of 5-ht via two
interrelated mechanisms. first, (de boer et al., 1996), blockade of
inhibitory a2-ar heteroceptors on serotonergic terminals in the
hippocampus (tao & hjorth, 1992; gobbi et al., 1993; mongeau
et al., 1994). second, (haddjeri et al., 1996, 1997), blockade of  xxxg82xxx  autoreceptors, thereby facilitating adrenergic input to serotonergic neurons of raphe nuclei which possess excitatory a1-ars
(lejeune et al., 1994; rouquier et al., 1994; hjorth et al., 1995).

1080 m. j. millan et al.
further, because mirtazapine shows antagonist actions at 5-ht2a, 5ht2c and 5-ht3 receptors, it may speci®cally strengthen transmission at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors (berendsen & broekkamp,
1997; haddjeri et al., 1998; mcgrath et al., 1998), a role of which in
mediating antidepressant actions has been postulated (lucki et al.,
1994; schreiber et al., 1994; maes & meltzer, 1995; haddjeri et al.,
1998; millan et al., 1999).
while the serotonergic mechanism outlined above is appealing, a
recent preliminary communication reported that mirtazapine fails to
elevate extracellular levels of 5-ht in the hippocampus (bengtsson
et al., 1999). further, a2-ar antagonists do not consistently increase
corticolimbic serotonergic transmission (see discussion). on the
other hand, re¯ecting blockade of tonically active, inhibitory a2-ar
autoreceptors and heteroceptors, a2-ar antagonists consistently
enhance corticolimbic release of na, and frontocortical release of
dopamine (da), respectively (trendelenburg et al., 1994a; de boer
et al., 1996; gobert et al., 1998; hertel et al., 1999; millan et al.,
2000b). further, 5-ht2c receptors likewise tonically inhibit ascending adrenergic and dopaminergic pathways (prisco et al., 1994; di
matteo et al., 1998; di giovanni et al., 1999; gobert et al., 2000).
thus, blockade of a2-ar and 5-ht2c heteroceptors, in enhancing
corticolimbic adrenergic and frontocortical dopaminergic transmission, might, in theory, contribute to the antidepressant properties of
mirtazapine.
in light of the above, the present study examined the in¯uence (of
acute and chronic administration) of mirtazapine versus citalopram
upon corticolimbic serotonergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic
transmission. the following parameters were examined. first,
af®nities at 5-ht, da and na reuptake sites and at monoaminergic
receptors modulating corticolimbic monoaminergic transmission
(gobert et al., 1998; millan et al., 2000a). second, g-protein coupling
and phospholipase c activity at cloned, human (h)a2a-ars and h5ht2c receptors, respectively (gerhardt & van heerikhuizen, 1997;
jasper et al., 1997; newman-tancredi et al.. 1998). in addition,
antagonist actions of mirtazapine at these sites were evaluated in
functional models in vivo. third, extracellular levels of 5-ht, na and
da in single dialysis samples of fcx, dorsal hippocampus, nucleus
accumbens and striatum of freely moving rats. finally, electrical
activity of serotonergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic neurons
localized in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn), locus coeruleus (lc)
and ventral tegmental area (vta), respectively.

materials and methods
binding studies
the af®nities of mirtazapine and citalopram for native and cloned,
human dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic receptors and
reuptake sites were evaluated employing standard protocols summarized in table 1. non-linear, regression analysis of isotherms was
undertaken by prism software (graphpad software, san diego, ca,
usa) to yield inhibitory concentration (ic) values. these were
transformed into ki values according to cheng±prussof: ki = ic50/
(1 + l/kd), where l corresponds to the radioligand concentration and
kd to its dissociation constant.
antagonist properties at ha2a-ars
as described in detail previously (newman-tancredi et al., 1998), the
binding of guanosine-5¢-o-(3-[35s]thio)-triphosphate ([35s]-gtpgs,
0.1 nm, 1000 ci/mmol; nen, les ulis, france) at ha2a-ar receptors
expressed in cho cells was employed as a measure of the ef®cacy
with which mirtazapine interacts at these sites. mirtazapine was
evaluated both alone (agonist activity) and in the presence of a ®xed

concentration of na (antagonist activity). the buffer employed was
as follows: hepes (20 mm), nacl (100 mm), gdp (3 mm) and
 xxxd2534xxx  (3 mm). incubations were undertaken at a ph of 7.4 and a
temperature of 22 °c for 60 min. the ef®cacy of mirtazapine was
expressed relative to that of a maximally effective concentration of
na (10 mm, de®ned as 100%). for the antagonist studies, concentration±response curves of the blocking properties of mirtazapine were
analysed as described in newman-tancredi et al. (1998) in order to
yield kb values.
antagonist properties at h5-ht2c receptors
phospholipase c activity was monitored by measuring the decrease of
[3h]-phosphatidylinositol ([3h]-pi) levels in cell membranes. brie¯y,
h5-ht2c receptors expressed in cho cells were labelled with 2 mci/
ml of myo-[3h]-inositol for 24 h in serum-free ultracho medium
(bio whittaker, walkersville, md, usa). cells were then incubated
with receptor ligands at 37 °c for 20 min in krebs±licl buffer (in
mm): nah2po4, 15.6, ph 7; nacl, 120; kcl, 4.8;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; cacl2,
1.2; glucose, 0.6 % (w/v); bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0.04 (w/v); licl,
10. assays were stopped by addition of methanol±hcl (0.12 m) and
cells were kept for at least 2 h at ±20 °c before sonication and
®ltration through gf/b ®lters impregnated with 0.1% polyethyleneimine. radioactivity was determined by liquid-scintillation counting.
the ef®cacy of mirtazapine was expressed relative to that of a
maximally effective concentration of 5-ht (1 mm, de®ned as 100%).
for the antagonist studies, concentration±response curves of the
blocking properties of mirtazapine were analysed as described in
newman-tancredi et al. (1998) in order to yield kb values.
animals
these studies employed male wistar rats (200±300 g) or nmri mice
(22±25 g, iffa credo, l'arbresle, france). they were housed in
sawdust-lined cages with unrestricted access to food and water.
laboratory humidity was 60 6 5% and temperature 21 6 1 °c. lights
were on from 07.30 to 19.30 h. animals were adapted for at least
1 week to laboratory conditions prior to use. all animal use
procedures conformed to international european ethical standards
(86/609-eec) and the french national commitee (deâcret 87/848) for
the care and use of laboratory animals.
antagonist properties at a2-ars in vivo: blockade of uk14,304-induced antinociception
the hot-plate procedure for characterization of antinociceptive
properties was performed as described in detail previously (millan
et al., 1994). brie¯y, mice were placed onto the centre of a
circular, copper plate of 19 cm diameter and maintained at 55 °c.
the latency to lick either front paw was determined with a limit
of 60 s. vehicle or mirtazapine were administered s.c. 40 min, and
vehicle or the a2-ar agonist, uk-14,304 (0.31 mg/kg, s.c.), were
injected 30 min prior to determination of latencies. the per cent
inhibition
was
computed
as
follows:
100 3 {1 ±
[(mirtazapine + uk-14,304) ± (vehicle + vehicle)]/[(vehicle + uk14,304) ± (vehicle + vehicle)]}.
antagonist properties at 5-ht2c receptors in vivo: blockade of
ro 60 0175-induced penile erections (pe)
as described previously (millan et al., 1997), rats were individually
placed in transparent, plexiglass observation cages immediately
following mirtazapine or vehicle administration. thirty minutes later,
all animals received ro 60 0175 (1.25 mg/kg, s.c.), and pe were
measured over a further 30 min observation period.

monoamines and depression
antagonist properties at 5-ht2c receptors in vivo: blockade of
ro 60 0175-induced discriminative stimulus properties
the experimental procedure was described in detail previously
(<1000>dekeyne et al., 1999). brie¯y, rats were trained to
discriminate ro 60 0175 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline employing a
two-lever ®xed ratio 10, food-reinforced, operant design. training
sessions started 15 min after ro-60 0175 or saline injection, lasted
15 min and were performed daily, except weekends. the discriminative criterion consisted of 10 consecutive sessions with correct
responding. subsequently, test sessions were conducted on
wednesday and friday, whereas training sessions continued on the
other days. for testing, mirtazapine was administered s.c. 30 min
prior to ro 60 0175.
modulation of the electrical activity of dopaminergic,
adrenergic and serotonergic neurons in anaesthetized rats
techniques detailed previously (aghajanian et al., 1977; lejeune &
millan, 1998) were employed for determination of the in¯uence of
mirtazapine and citalopram upon the electrical activity of dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic perikarya localized in the vta,
lc and drn, respectively. rats were anaesthetized with chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. a
tungsten microelectrode was lowered into the vta, lc or drn.
coordinates were as follows according to the atlas of paxinos &
watson (1986). vta, ap = 5.5 from bregma, l = 0.7, h = ±7 to ±8.5
from dura; lc, ap = ±1.2 from zero, l = 1.2 and h = ±5.5 to ±6.5;
drn, ap = ±7 to ±8 from bregma, l = 0.0, h = ±5 to ±6.5.
dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic neurons were identi®ed
according to their waveform as previously (above citations), and
baseline recording undertaken for at least 5 min. one cell was
recorded in each animal. the in¯uence of drugs (dissolved in sterile
water and injected i.v. in a volume of 0.5 ml/kg) upon ®ring rate was
evaluated after administration in cumulative doses at intervals of 2±
3 min. in order to examine the mechanism underlying inhibition by
citalopram of serotonergic neurons, a single dose of citalopram was
injected (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) followed, 3 min later, by an injection of the
5-ht1a antagonist, way-100,635 (0.031 mg/kg, i.v.). drug effects
were characterized over 60 s at the time of peak action. spike2
software (ced, cambridge, uk) was used for signal acquisition and
off-line analysis. data are presented as per cent change from preinjection, basal values (de®ned as 0%).
in¯uence of drugs upon dialysate levels of da, na and 5-ht
in the fcx, dorsal hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and
striatum of freely moving rats
the protocol used for quanti®cation of da, na and 5-ht levels in
single dialysate samples of fcx, accumbens and striatum of freely
moving rats has been detailed elsewhere (gobert et al. 1998, 2000).
using the same procedure, we examined levels of na and 5-ht in a
single dialysate sample of the dorsal hippocampus with a guide
cannula implanted in rats under pentobarbital anaesthesia (60 mg/kg,
i.p.) at the following coordinates: ap = ±3.6 from bregma, l = 6 1.2
and h = ±2.3 from dura. all dialysis experiments were performed
5 days after placement of guide cannula. a cuprophane cma/11
probe, 2 mm length, 0.24 mm o.d. was lowered into position and
perfused at 1 ml/min with a phosphate-buffered solution of (in mm):
nacl, 147.2; kcl, 4; cacl2, 2.3 (ph 7.3). two hours after
implantation, samples were taken every 20 min and, following three
basal samples, mirtazapine, citalopram or vehicle was injected
subcutaneously and sampling pursued for 3 h. the in¯uence of drugs
and vehicle was expressed relative to basal values (de®ned as 0%).

1081

the assay sensitivity was ~ 0.1±0.2 pg per sample for da, na and 5ht in each case.
chronic studies
vehicle, mirtazapine or citalopram were administered s.c. to rats once
daily over a period of 2 weeks. the doses of mirtazapine and
citalopram were 10 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively. on the 15th day, the
in¯uence of an additional acute administration of vehicle, mirtazapine or citalopram at the same dose upon fcx levels of da, na and
5-ht was evaluated as described above. in addition, in a separate
group, their in¯uence upon the electrical activity of drn-localized 5ht neurons was examined as detailed above.
statistics
in the hot plate and pe procedures, data were evaluated by anova
followed by dunnett's test. in the drug discrimination procedure, the
percentage of rats selecting the drug lever was calculated and
compared by a fisher exact probability test to control training values
(100% drug lever selection). the inhibitory dose (id)50 plus 95%
con®dence limits (95% cl) and effective dose50 (95% cls) were
calculated as appropriate. in electrophysiological studies, data were
analysed by anova followed by newman±keuls test. in dialysis
studies, data were analysed by anova with sampling time as the
repeated within-subject factor.
drugs
drugs were dissolved in sterile water. for mirtazapine and ro 60
0175, a few drops of lactic acid were added and the ph adjusted
to as close to neutrality as possible (ph > 5.0). drug doses are in
terms of the base and, unless indicated, drugs were administered
subcutaneously. drug sources were as follows. uk-14,304 [5bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)quinoxaline, tartrate] was obtained from p®zer (orsay, france). (6)-mirtazapine, citalopram,
way-100,635 (n-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl}n-(2-pyridinyl) cyclo-hexanecarboxamide fumarate) and ro 60
0175 [2(s)-1-(6-chloro-5-¯uoro-1h-indol-1-yl)-2-propanamine fumarate] were synthesized by servier chemists (j.-l. peglion and
g. lavielle).

results
binding pro®les of mirtazapine and citalopram compared
citalopram displayed marked af®nity for 5-ht reuptake sites yet
negligible af®nity for na and da reuptake sites, while
mirtazapine was inactive at each of these (table 1). citalopram
showed low af®nity for all other sites examined. mirtazapine, on
the other hand, displayed signi®cant af®nity both for native, rat
a1-ars and for cloned, ha1a-ars. further, mirtazapine also
manifested marked af®nity for native, rat a2-ars, as well as
cloned ha2a-ars. its af®nity for rat a2-ars was ®vefold higher
than for their rat a1-ar counterparts, while its af®nity for ha2aars was fourfold higher than for ha1a-ars. the af®nity of
mirtazapine for cloned  xxxg2028xxx - and  xxxg2028xxx -ars was negligible.
mirtazapine showed low af®nity for native and cloned h5-ht1a
receptors, and weak af®nity for native and cloned h5-ht1b and
h5-ht1d receptors. however, its af®nity was marked at native
and cloned h5-ht2a, h5-ht2b and h5-ht2c receptors. likewise,
mirtazapine revealed pronounced af®nity for cloned h5-ht3
receptors. finally, the af®nity of mirtazapine for native and
cloned hd2 and hd3 receptors was negligible.

antagonist properties of mirtazapine at cloned ha2a-ars in
vitro
na elicited a concentration-dependent increase in [35s]-gtpgs
binding at cloned ha2a-ars transfected into cho cells, with a
pec50 of 6.5 and a maximal stimulation (10 mm) of threefold relative
to basal values, in line with our previous observations (fig. 1,
newman-tancredi et al., 1998; millan et al., 2000b). mirtazapine
concentration-dependently abolished the stimulatory in¯uence of na
(10 mm) with a pkb of 6.9. tested alone, mirtazapine did not modify
[35s]-gtpgs binding.
antagonist properties of mirtazapine at a2-ars in vivo
the a2-ar antagonist, uk-14,304, elicited a marked antinociception
in the hot-plate procedure and this action was dose-dependently
blocked by mirtazapine with an id50 (95% cl) of 6.9 (3.8±12.5) mg/
kg (fig. 1). administered alone, mirtazapine did not signi®cantly
modify basal latencies to respond (not shown).
antagonist properties at cloned h5-ht2c receptors in vitro
at cloned h5-ht2c receptors transfected into cho cells, 5-ht
concentration-dependently augmented the hydrolysis of [3h]-pi with
a pec50 of 8.8 (fig. 2). in a typical experiment, basal levels of
30.000 d.p.m. were reduced to 12.000 d.p.m. in the presence of a
maximal effective (1 mm) concentration of 5-ht (not shown).
mirtazapine, which did not itself modify levels of [3h]-pi,
concentration-dependently antagonized the action of 5-ht (100 nm)
with a pkb of 7.3.
antagonist properties of mirtazapine at 5-ht2c receptors
in vivo
the selective  xxxg1115xxx  agonist, ro 60 0175, elicited a robust
pe response in rats (fig. 2, millan et al., 1997). this action was dosedependently blocked by mirtazapine with an id50 (95% cl) of 0.7
(0.4±1.2) mg/kg. mirtazapine, administered alone, did not evoke a

signi®cant pe response (not shown). ro 60 0175 showed robust
discriminative stimulus properties (<1000>dekeyne et al., 1999) and
this effect was dose-dependently blocked by mirtazapine with an
ed50 (95% cl) of 0.10 (0.06±0.20) mg/kg. over this dose range,
mirtazapine had no effect upon response rates (not shown).
in¯uence of mirtazapine compared with citalopram upon
dialysate levels of 5-ht, na and da
citalopram elicited a pronounced and dose-dependent elevation in
extracellular levels of 5-ht in dialysates of the fcx of freely moving
rats (fig. 3). in contrast, citalopram exerted little in¯uence upon
levels of na and da, although at the highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg),
relative to vehicle, there was a modest and transient, signi®cant
increase in na levels (fig. 3). in distinction to citalopram,
mirtazapine failed to modify dialysate levels of 5-ht in fcx,
despite eliciting a marked, sustained and dose-dependent elevation in
levels of na and da (fig. 3). in the dorsal hippocampus, citalopram
elicited a selective increase in dialysate levels of 5-ht compared with
those of na, while mirtazapine selectively enhanced levels of na
compared with those of 5-ht (fig. 4). in the nucleus accumbens and
striatum, citalopram augmented levels of 5-ht but had no effect upon
levels of da (figs 5 and 6). on the other hand, in both the nucleus
accumbens and striatum, mirtazapine failed to modify levels of 5-ht
and, relative to vehicle, marginally increased levels of da in the
striatum (figs 5 and 6).
in¯uence of mirtazapine compared with citalopram upon
electrical activity of serotonergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic
neurons
citalopram dose-dependently inhibited the electrical activity of drn
serotonergic neurons with an id50 (95% cl) of 65.9 (21.5±206.0) mg/
kg, i.v. over the same dose range, citalopram exerted little in¯uence
upon the activity of adrenergic neurons in the lc (fig. 7). likewise,
the electrical activity of dopaminergic neurons of the vta was not
signi®cantly affected by citalopram (fig. 7). in contrast to citalopram,

citalopram + way-100,635 (n = 5) = +58.4 6 12.5%, p < 0.001.
chronic administration of citalopram and mirtazapine
following chronic (2 weeks) administration of citalopram (2.5 mg/kg,
s.c.), there was no signi®cant alteration in basal levels of na or da in
fcx dialysates compared with animals chronically treated with
vehicle (fig. 9), although 5-ht levels were slightly increased. the
facilitatory in¯uence of a further acute application of citalopram upon
fcx levels of 5-ht in chronic citalopram versus chronic vehicle
groups, was slightly, but signi®cantly attenuated (fig. 9). in chronic
citalopram-treated rats, there was no modi®cation of the basal ®ring
rate of drn serotonergic neurons (not shown) and the dose±response
curve for inhibition by citalopram was not modi®ed (fig. 10). the
long-term (2 weeks) administration of mirtazapine (10.0 mg/kg, s.c.)
did not modify basal levels of 5-ht or na but slightly increased
levels of da in dialysates of the fcx (fig. 9). the selective
facilitatory in¯uence of mirtazapine upon fcx levels of da and na
compared with 5-ht was not diminished by its long-term administration. indeed, its facilitation of na levels was slightly enhanced.
moreover, in chronic, mirtazapine-treated rats, the basal ®ring of
drn cells was not modi®ed (not shown), and there was still no
signi®cant effect of acute mirtazapine upon ®ring rate (fig. 10).

mirtazapine markedly, potently and dose-dependently enhanced the
®ring rate of both adrenergic and dopaminergic neurons (fig. 7), and
slightly, but not signi®cantly, tended to reduce the ®ring rate of
serotonergic neurons (fig. 7). moreover, as shown in fig. 8,
mirtazapine transformed the regular, basal ®ring rate of dopaminergic
neurons into a spike-bursting mode. the percentage of cells ®ring in
the burst mode increased from 28.2 6 9.2% (vehicle) to 56.2 6 10.5%
(mirtazapine, 63 mg/kg, i.v.), p < 0.01. the inhibitory effect of
citalopram on drn ®ring rate was abolished by the selective 5-

in con®rmation of previous studies (owens et al., 1997; tatsumi et al.
1997), citalopram displayed marked selectivity for 5-ht reuptake
sites, whereas mirtazapine showed only low af®nity (de boer, 1996;
tatsumi et al., 1997). however, mirtazapine manifested high af®nity
for cloned h5-ht2a, h5-ht2b, h5-ht2c and h5-ht3 receptors, as
well as ha1a- and ha2a-ars. these observations at speci®c, human
receptor subtypes are of importance in extending previous observations at native populations of receptors (de boer, 1996).
antagonist properties of mirtazapine at a2-ars have been shown
both centrally (blockade of the in¯uence of na upon the activity of
pyramidal cells in the hippocampus) and peripherally (blockade of
clonidine-induced midriasis) in rats (haddjeri et al., 1995; de boer,
1996). these observations are underpinned by the present demonstration that mirtazapine blocks antinociceptive actions of the a2-ar
agonist, uk-14,304, a response mediated by the a2a-ar subtype
(millan et al., 1994; hunter et al., 1997; lakhlani et al., 1997).
further, mirtazapine antagonized na-stimulated [35s]-gtpgs binding at cloned ha2a-ars, a response re¯ecting activation of gi/oproteins (jasper et al., 1997; newman-tancredi et al., 1998; millan
et al., 2000b). these antagonist properties of mirtazapine at a2a-ars
are of importance inasmuch as they are the principal a2-ar subtype
implicated in the inhibitory control of adrenergic, serotonergic and
dopaminergic pathways innervating the fcx and other forebrain
structures (millan et al., 1994; trendelenburg et al., 1994a,b; talley
et al., 1996; sallinen et al., 1997; gobert et al., 1998; callado &
stamford, 1999).
antagonism by mirtazapine of pe elicited by mcpp indicates
antagonist properties at central 5-ht2c receptors (de boer, 1996).
however, mcpp does not differentiate 5-ht2c from 5-ht2a/2b
receptors, so it is of signi®cance that mirtazapine similarly abolished
pe elicited by the selective 5-ht2c agonist, ro 60 0175 (millan et al.,
1997). further, 5-ht2c receptors mediate the discriminative stimulus
properties of ro 60 0175 (dekeyne et al., 1999), which were likewise

abolished by mirtazapine. these in vivo data are complemented by
the potent antagonist properties of mirtazapine at cloned h5-ht2c
receptors (fig. 2) which couple, via a gq g-protein, to phospholipase
c (gerhardt & van heerikhuizen, 1997).
in¯uence upon serotonergic transmission: dialysis studies
citalopram elevated dialysate levels of 5-ht versus da and na in
all structures irrespective of their principal source of serotonergic
input: fcx, nucleus accumbens and striatum from the drn; and
dorsal hippocampus from the median raphe nucleus (mrn) (vertes,
1991; kreiss & lucki, 1994; vertes et al., 1999). following chronic
citalopram treatment, in line with previous studies (invernizzi et al.,
1994; arborelius et al., 1996; gundlah et al., 1997), there was a mild
elevation in basal levels of 5-ht, and its acute facilitatory in¯uence
was not potentiated. these observations suggest little alteration in the
sensitivity of 5-ht1a autoreceptors. however, adaptive processes
following long-term ssri administration depend upon the precise
conditions of study (drug, dose, half-life, active metabolites, duration
of treatment, etc.), an issue discussed elsewhere (blier & de
montigny, 1994; hjorth & auerbach, 1994; le poul et al., 1995;
arborelius et al., 1996; artigas et al., 1996; invernizzi et al., 1996;
gundlah et al., 1997; kreiss & lucki, 1997).

in distinction to citalopram, mirtazapine failed to increase 5-ht
levels in freely moving rats in corticolimbic structures innervated by
the drn and/or mrn, upon acute and chronic (fcx) administration,
and over a broad dose range markedly elevating levels of da and
na. in analogy, bengtsson et al. (1999) observed a lack of in¯uence
of systemic or local administration of mirtazapine upon dialysate
levels of 5-ht in dorsal hippocampus and fcx. similarly, de boer
et al. (1996) reported that mirtazapine does not affect 5-ht levels in
the striatum. however, at doses of 2 and 5 mg/kg s.c., these latter
authors observed a modest, non dose-dependent (+80%) increase in
dialysate levels of 5-ht in the ventral hippocampus (de boer &
ruigt, 1995; de boer et al., 1996). it is important to consider reasons
underlying these apparently discrepant reports.
first, in the present study and that of bengtsson et al. (1999), 5-ht
levels were determined in the dorsal hippocampus, whereas de boer
et al. (1996) conducted studies in the ventral hippocampus. however,
bengtsson and hjorth (personal communication) observed that
mirtazapine also did not elevate levels of 5-ht in the ventral
hippocampus. further, employing an electrophysiological approach,
haddjeri et al. (1995) found that mirtazapine enhanced serotonergic
input onto ca3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus. thus,
differences between the present ®ndings and those of bengtsson et al.

(1999) compared with the observations of de boer et al. (1996) do
not re¯ect the study of different regions of the hippocampus.
second, while the dorsal hippocampus is innervated by the mrn,
the ventral hippocampus receives serotonergic input from the drn
(vertes, 1991; kreiss & lucki, 1994; vertes et al., 1999). however,
even in structures innervated solely by the drn ± striatum, nucleus
accumbens and fcx ± mirtazapine failed to elevate 5-ht levels (figs
3, 5 and 6; bengtsson et al., 1999).
third, in contrast to de boer et al. (1996), the high sensitivity of
our dialysis system permits quanti®cation of 5-ht levels without
addition of a ssri to the perfusate (gobert et al., 1998). this is of
signi®cance inasmuch as the elevation of basal 5-ht levels by ssris
may modify the actions of certain drug classes (kreiss et al., 1993).
however, bengtsson et al. (1999) similarly employed a ssri
suggesting that this is probably not a crucial factor.
fourth, in fact, bengtsson et al. (1999) used a low concentration of
citalopram (1 mm). in contrast, de boer et al. (1996) employed
¯uoxetine, a less selective ssri which, upon systemic administration,
markedly elevates dialysis levels of both 5-ht and na in the
hippocampus and fcx (jordan et al., 1994; gobert et al., 1997, 1998;
millan et al., 2000a). further, the perfusate concentration of ¯uoxetine
(50 mm) is far in excess of its ki for 5-ht (0.02 mm) and na (0.6 mm)
reuptake sites (owens et al., 1997; millan et al., 2000a), suggesting

that basal levels of 5-ht and na were raised. although na levels
were not quanti®ed by de boer et al. (1996), in support of this
assertion, their basal 5-ht levels were ~ 20-fold higher than herein. in
analogy, the conclusion of mongeau et al. (1993) that a2-ars in the
ventral hippocampus tonically inhibit 5-ht release was based
principally on stimulatory effects of a2-ar antagonists in the presence
of the na reuptake inhibitor, desipramine. an elevation of resting na
levels by reuptake inhibitors (de boer et al., 1996) is, thus, a likely
source of variation compared with the present work and that of
bengtsson et al. (1999). that is, in the presence of an elevated
extracellular level of na, there is a more pronounced adrenergic `tone'
at a2-ar receptors on serotonergic terminals available for blockade by
mirtazapine; hence, it increases 5-ht levels under such conditions.
fifth, irrespective of the use of reuptake inhibitors, resting
adrenergic tone may differ. the activity of adrenergic systems
re¯ects states of stress and arousal (aston-jones et al., 1991; bremner
et al., 1996; gobert et al., 1998; rosario & abercrombie, 1999).
while a 24-h recovery period after cannula implantation was used by
de boer et al. (1996), the herein-employed, 5-day period facilitates
studies under `resting' conditions. in addition, rats were extensively
adapted to manipulation in order to reduce the `stress' associated with
experimentation. overall, the present conditions favour a low, resting
adrenergic tone.

nevertheless, even a high adrenergic tone for de boer et al. (1996)
cannot provide a full explanation inasmuch as they reported that
idazoxan and  xxxd2637xxx , potent a2-ar antagonists, did not increase
hippocampal 5-ht levels. in this respect, the data of de boer et al.
(1996) parallel other studies in which  xxxd2637xxx , idazoxan and the
highly-selective a2-ar antagonists, atipamezole and ¯uparoxan,
failed to increase 5-ht levels in the hippocampus or fcx of
conscious rats (kreiss & lucki, 1995; haapalinna et al., 1997; gobert
et al., 1997, 1998; millan et al., 2000b). indeed, tonic a2-armediated control of cerebral 5-ht release and, correspondingly, the
in¯uence of a2-ar antagonists upon 5-ht levels, is variable (garratt
et al., 1991; tao & hjorth, 1992; yoshioka et al., 1995; kreiss &
lucki, 1995; gobert et al., 1997, 1998; hertel et al., 1998).
in¯uence of mirtazapine upon serotonergic transmission:
electrophysiological studies
citalopram (way100,635-reversibly) suppressed the ®ring of drn
serotonergic neurons; this action re¯ects the activation by 5-ht of
inhibitory, dendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors on serotonergic cell bodies
(arborelius et al., 1996; invernizzi et al., 1996; gundlah et al., 1997).
in distinction, mirtazapine failed to modify their ®ring rate.
(although the doses of citalopram and mirtazapine employed in
these electrophysiology studies probably correspond to those utilized

in dialysis work, in the absence of absolute measures of drug levels,
such assertions must be made cautiously.) the lack of effect of
mirtazapine on drn ®ring contrasts with the report by haddjeri et al.
(1996) of a dose-dependent, excitatory in¯uence of mirtazapine upon
the ®ring rate of drn serotonergic neurons ± an effect abolished by a
6-hydroxydopamine lesion of adrenergic neurons.
while it may be of signi®cance that the present study and that
of haddjeri et al. (1996) were performed in wistar and sprague±
dawley rats, respectively, it is important to consider evidence that
a2-ar blockade by mirtazapine can, indeed, enhance drn
activity.
first, hertel et al. (1998) and garratt et al. (1991) reported that
idazoxan enhances the ®ring rate of drn serotonergic neurons.
however, direct iontophoretic administration was not effective.
further, although freedman & aghajanian (1984) found that
idazoxan modestly excites the drn, this action was seen only in a
subpopulation of neurons, and a higher dose of idazoxan inhibited
drn ®ring ± probably due to its a1-ar antagonist actions. further, it
is possible that actions of idazoxan at imidazoline (i2) sites may be
involved in its facilitatory in¯uence upon drn activity (piletz &
halaris, 1994; parini et al., 1996). moreover, in contrast to idazoxan
(garratt et al., 1991; hertel et al., 1998), the highly selective a2-ar
antagonist, atipamezole, does not enhance corticolimbic synthesis or

release of 5-ht in conscious animals (haapalinna et al., 1997; gobert
et al., 1997, 1998).
second, there is a marked, tonic, excitatory control of drn ®ring
by a1-ars. correspondingly, a1-ar antagonists suppress the ®ring
of serotonergic cells in the drn and mrn (alojado et al., 1994;
lejeune et al., 1994; pan et al., 1994; rouquier et al., 1994; hjorth
et al., 1995), in parallel with a reduction in corticolimbic levels of 5ht (gobert et al., 1998). this pronounced a1-ar tone suggests that
any additional increase in a1-ar stimulation mediated by na is
liable to be modest. indeed, the excitatory actions of na at
serotonergic neurons in the drn are weak, variable and dependent
upon the iontophoretic current (gallagher & aghajanian, 1976).
moreover, additional inhibitory actions of na at a1-ar on drn
neurons ± mediated via a contrasting transduction mechanism ± have
been documented, complicating interpretation of its actions
(freedman & aghajanian, 1987). finally, the a1-ar agonists,
 xxxd1707xxx  and st-587, while relieving the suppressive in¯uence of
 xxxd3000xxx , do not themselves excite drn serotonergic neurons and, in
conscious animals, they fail to increase extracellular levels of 5-ht in
fcx, striatum or hippocampus (lejeune et al., 1994; gobert et al.,
1998).
third, haddjeri et al. (1996) showed an excitatory in¯uence of
mirtazapine upon the electrical activity of serotonergic neurons in the

drn rather than the mrn. now, according to rouquier et al. (1994),
 xxxd3000xxx  more markedly decreases 5-ht release in the hippocampus
(mrn-innervated) than in the striatum (drn-innervated). this
suggests that the tonic, a1-ar-mediated control of mrn-derived
serotonergic neurons projecting to the hippocampus may be even
higher than in its drn counterpart. thus, an excitatory in¯uence of
a2-ar antagonists upon mrn input to the hippocampus is less
probable than for the drn.
fourth, mirtazapine possesses marked af®nity for a1-ars (table 1;
de boer et al., 1996). indeed, its preference for a2- versus a1-ars
(and a2a- versus a1a-ars) herein was only fourfold, leaving little
margin for `low' doses of mirtazapine to block a2-ar receptors (and
increase na release onto a1-ars in the drn) compared with `high'
doses which would directly block the latter. nevertheless, the af®nity
of mirtazapine for rat a1b-ars, the most concentrated subtype in the
drn (day et al., 1997), remains to be evaluated.
adrenergic tone and the actions of mirtazapine
to summarize, the present observations agree with bengtsson et al.
(1999) and differ from de boer et al. (1996) and haddjeri et al.
(1996) in that they did not reveal a facilitatory in¯uence of
mirtazapine upon corticolimbic serotonergic transmission. one

ated ± adrenergic tone in the work of de boer et al. (1996). on the
other hand, the argument that mirtazapine excites serotonergic cell
bodies in the drn via indirect engagement of a1-ars therein is
questioned by the high tonic activity of adrenergic input to the
drn ± as well as the intrinsic a1-ar antagonist properties of
mirtazapine itself. nevertheless, the degree of adrenergic tone in
depressed patients cannot be speci®ed. the adrenergic de®cit theory
of depression suggests that this tone is low (leonard, 1997). in this
case, actions of mirtazapine at a2-ars controlling hippocampal 5-ht
release are particularly unlikely, whereas there is greater scope for the
activation of a1-ars on drn neurons. on the other hand, the
activation of cerebral adrenergic transmission by `stress' (astonjones et al., 1991; rosario & abercrombie, 1999) in susceptible
humans, in enhancing adrenergic tone, would decrease the likelihood
of a1-ar engagement in drn, but favour blockade by mirtazapine of
tonically active, hippocampal a2-ars.

in a single-dose study (0.25 mg/kg), mirtazapine enhanced the ®ring
rate of lc-localized adrenergic neurons (haddjeri et al., 1996), an
observation ampli®ed herein with a full dose±response relationship.
this action may be attributed to the antagonist properties of
mirtazapine at a2a-ar autoreceptors (vide supra), the principal
subtype principally involved in the modulation of adrenergic
transmission (talley et al., 1996; sallinen et al., 1997; gobert et al.,
1998; kawahara et al., 1999; callado & stamford, 1999). blockade of
a2a-ars similarly accounts for the enhancement by mirtazapine of
na levels in the fcx and hippocampus upon both acute and chronic
(fcx) administration (fig. 9). these data, analogous to other a2-ar
antagonists (thomas et al., 1994; gobert et al., 1997), are important
in extending measures of the in¯uence of mirtazapine upon the na
metabolite, dopac, in the ventral hippocampus (de boer et al.,
1996) to na itself. however, apart from a2a-ar blockade, the
probable signi®cance of antagonist actions of mirtazapine at 5-ht2c
receptors should be accentuated inasmuch as 5-ht2c receptors exert a
tonic, inhibitory in¯uence upon lc-derived, adrenergic pathways via
activation of gabaergic interneurons (done & sharp, 1994;
pompeiano et al., 1994; gobert et al., 1998, 2000; gorea & adrien,
1988).
facilitation of frontocortical dopaminergic transmission
mirtazapine exerted a pronounced elevation of da levels in fcx.
there are several, potential underlying mechanisms. first, extracellular da levels in fcx are synaptically cleared by da and na
reuptake sites (gresch et al., 1995). thus, a rise in fcx levels of da
may, at least partially, be secondary to an elevation in na levels.
second, dopaminergic projections to the fcx are subject to tonic
inhibition by a2a-ars on their terminals (trendelenburg et al.,
1994a; gobert et al., 1997, 1998; hertel et al., 1999); these are
probably blocked by mirtazapine. third, 5-ht2c receptors exert a
pronounced and tonic, inhibitory control upon mesocortical dopaminergic pathways (kelland & chiodo, 1996; millan et al., 1998;
gobert et al., 2000); blockade of 5-ht2c receptors by mirtazapine
probably contributes, then, to the increase in fcx levels of da.

monoamines and depression
5-ht2c receptors exert their inhibitory in¯uence upon mesocortical
dopaminergic transmission via excitation of inhibitory gabaergic
interneurons in the vta (morilak et al., 1993; pessia et al., 1994;
prisco et al., 1994; kelland & chiodo, 1996; di giovanni et al., 1999;
gobert et al., 2000). correspondingly, mirtazapine enhanced the
®ring rate of dopaminergic neurons in the vta and transformed

1091

`regular' ®ring cells into a `burst' mode. inasmuch as idazoxan and
yohimbine excite vta-localized dopaminergic neurons (grenhoff &
svensson, 1989; grenhoff et al., 1993), a potential role of a2a-ar
blockade might also be evoked in the activation of dopaminergic cell
bodies by mirtazapine. however, partial agonist actions of idazoxan
and yohimbine at 5-ht1a receptors may contribute to their excitation
of mesocortical dopaminergic neurons (millan et al., 2000b). thus,
the principle mode of action of mirtazapine is probably blockade of 5ht2c receptors.
the activity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways is likewise
suppressed by 5-ht2c receptors, but this tonic control may be less
pronounced than for mesocortical dopaminergic pathways (di matteo
et al., 1998; di giovanni et al., 1999; gobert et al., 2000). further,
striatal release of da is not prominently controlled by adrenergic
mechanisms (trendelenburg et al., 1994a; yavich et al., 1997; millan
et al., 2000a). there is also little evidence that a2-ars tonically
suppress da release in the nucleus accumbens (yavich et al., 1997).
further, although 5-ht2c receptors tonically reduce da release in
nucleus accumbens, this effect is less marked than in the fcx (di
matteo et al., 1998; di giovanni et al., 1999; gobert et al., 2000).
these observations probably explain the minor effect of mirtazapine
upon da levels in the nucleus accumbens and striatum.
signi®cance of reinforced corticolimbic adrenergic and
dopaminergic transmission
the hypofrontality associated with disruption of frontocortical
dopaminergic and adrenergic transmission is implicated in depressive
states (goodwin, 1997; soares & mann, 1997; roger et al., 1998;
millan et al., 2000a). indeed, in interaction with subcortical limbic
regions, e.g. the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, both
dopaminergic and adrenergic mechanisms in the fcx play a major
role in the control of mood and cognition (foote & aston-jones,
1995; arnsten, 1997; coull et al., 1997; goldman-rakic et al., 1997;
goodwin, 1997). clearly, then, the possible signi®cance of a
potentiation of dopaminergic and adrenergic input to the fcx in
the antidepressant actions of mirtazapine justi®es consideration
(tanda et al., 1994; millan et al., 2000a). moreover, the generalized
reinforcement of corticolimbic adrenergic activity by mirtazapine is
also of probable importance (caldecott-hazard et al., 1991; leonard,
1997).

as discussed above, the antagonist properties of mirtazapine at 5ht2c receptors may be of importance to its functional actions.
however, the precise role of  xxxg1115xxx  blockade in the control
of mood still requires elucidation. certain authors have suggested that
 xxxg1115xxx  agonists exert a positive in¯uence upon mood (jenck
et al., 1994; moreau et al., 1996). on the other hand, there is evidence
that a diminution in activity at 5-ht2c sites is associated with
antidepressant properties. first, in analogy to mirtazapine, several
other antidepressants, e.g. nefazodone, trazodone and  xxxd2637xxx ,

possess 5-ht2c antagonist properties (frazer, 1997). second, longterm antidepressant (ssri) treatment may result in a reduction of
tone at 5-ht2c receptors (hand et al., 1991; forster & fletcher, 1995;
deakin, 1996; quested et al., 1997; bristow et al., 2000). third, in
experimental models,  xxxg1115xxx  blockade is accompanied by
robust anxiolytic actions (kennett et al., 1996, 1997; griebel et al.,
1997). this is of particular interest as concerns the increasing use of
antidepressant agents in the long-term management of anxious (and
co-morbid anxiodepressive) states (rickels et al., 1993; rocca et al.,
1997; casacalenda & boulenger, 1998; lydiard, 1998). finally, there
is some evidence that the preferential 5-ht2c antagonist, ritanserin,
shows antidepressant properties in man (bersani et al., 1991; bakish
et al., 1993). nevertheless, clinical data concerning the actions of
selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists in depressed patients will be
required for a clearer assessment of the importance of 5-ht2c
receptor blockade in the management of depressive states.

summary and conclusions
employing a complementary electrophysiological and neurochemical
approach, and both acute and chronic administration, mirtazapine
elicited a robust and pronounced enhancement in the activity of
corticolimbic adrenergic and frontocortical dopaminergic pathways.
these actions may be attributed to its antagonist properties at
inhibitory, tonically active 5-ht2c receptors and a2a-ars, although
their relative importance remains to be elucidated. mirtazapine did not,
in contrast, facilitate cerebral serotonergic transmission herein, an
observation in agreement with the studies of bengtsson et al. (1999),
but in contrast to those of de boer et al. (1996) and haddjeri et al.
(1996). while differences in adrenergic tone are probably involved,
the precise reasons underlying these contrasting patterns of data
require further elucidation. nevertheless, all studies to date concur that
mirtazapine enhances adrenergic transmission. there is also a
consensus that mirtazapine is an effective and innovative antidepressant, and the present ®ndings should encourage further studies ± both
experimental and clinical ± of its mechanism(s) of action.
