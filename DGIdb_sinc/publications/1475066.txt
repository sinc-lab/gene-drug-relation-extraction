potential of memantine,  xxxd3456xxx , and atropine in preventing acute toxic myopathy induced by organophosphate nerve agents: soman, sarin, tabu...  male sprague-dawley rats when administered sc a sublethal dose of organophosphorus cholinesterase inhibitors such as the nerve agents, soman (100 micrograms/kg, sc), sarin (110 micrograms/kg, sc), tabun (200 micrograms/kg, sc), or vx (12 micrograms/kg, sc), developed seizures and severe muscle fasciculations within 15-20 min, lasting for 4-6 hr. marked inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache) and necrotic lesions in skeletal muscles such as soleus, extensor digitorum longus, and diaphragm were evident between 1-24 hr following injection. pretreatment with memantine hcl (mem, 18 mg/kg, sc) together with  xxxd247xxx  (ats, 16 mg/kg, sc), 60 min and 15 min, respectively, prior to nerve agents attenuated ache inhibition, prevented myonecrosis, and muscle fasciculations as well as other signs of cholinergic toxicity. pretreatment combining  xxxd3456xxx  (d-tc, 0.075 mg/kg, sc) and ats (16 mg/kg, sc) prevented the myonecrosis and fasciculation without protecting ache against inhibition by these nerve agents. neither mem, d-tc, nor ats in the concentration given interfered with the normal behavior of the rats. the role of d-tc and ats interaction with presynaptic receptors regulating ach release and mem's role in modulating neural hyperactivity as protective mechanisms are discussed.
