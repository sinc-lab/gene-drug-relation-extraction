abstract background:  xxxd2880xxx  (ptx) decreases necessity of cell energy and inflammatory reactions
via inhibition of 5 -nucleotidase (5 - xxxg1612xxx ). the aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of ptx into
the  xxxd2988xxx  solutions avoids myocardial inflammatory reactions and ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury
during extracorpereal circulation. methods: between december 1999 and february 2002, we operated 75
patients with the diagnoses of atrial septal defect (asd), ventricular septal defect (vsd), valve disease, and
coronary disease. the average age of patients was 42.4 and male–female ratio was 1 : 1.5. the patients were
divided into two groups, which were the study group (n = 40) and the control group (n = 35). we used
cold blood cardioplegia mixed with st. thomas’ hospital ii  xxxd2988xxx  solution for both of the groups. ptx
was added into the  xxxd2988xxx  solution (500 mg/l) in the study group. interleukin-6 (il-6),  xxxg562xxx 
(il-8), and tumor necrotisis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels in coronary sinus blood samples during cross-clamp time
(x-clamp) and after releasing of it and tissue tnf-alpha in the right atrial appendix biopsy material that was
taken after x-clamp were studied to compare the both groups. results: after releasing x-clamp, results
of blood tnf-alpha, il-6, and il-8 of both groups were statistically significant (p < 0.005). at the pathological
examination, we also observed that the amount of tissue tnf-alpha in the control group (66 ± 17.1) was much
higher than the study group (16.6 ± 5.9, p <0.005). conclusions: these results show that ptx may be added
into  xxxd2988xxx  solution to avoid the myocardial inflammation and i/r injury during open heart surgery.

during cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardium is
exposed to several types of insults such as ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury and inflammatory responses.1 these factors interact in an attempt to
increase each other’s damaging capacity, and tissue injury occurs as a result of a complex metabolic chain of
events.
newborns and children tolerate cardiac i/r injury
much better than adults.2 in the immature heart, the energy stores are enough after ischemic period because
there is a low activity of 5 -nucleotidase (5 - xxxg1612xxx ).3-5 in
the adult heart, the enzyme 5 - xxxg1612xxx  catalyzes the degradation of adenosine monophospate (amp) and inosine monoposphate (imp) nucleotides into their precursors.6,7  xxxd2880xxx  (ptx) avoids dephosphorylazation
of amp to adenosine and imp to inosine via inhibition
of 5 - xxxg1612xxx .2 ptx also decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines, have antiinflammatory properties, and decreases tissue injury by exerting its effect

at different steps of this metabolic chain interleukin-6
(il-6),  xxxg562xxx  (il-8), and tumor necrotisis factor-alpha
(tnf-alpha) appear as a reason of inflammatory response
which are also the early parameters for detecting the
i/r injury.2,8-10 in this study, we used these parameters
to investigate whether ptx decreases the inflammation
effect and i/r injury.
materials and methods
the study has been performed under the ethic organization of gaziantep university and patients.
between december 1999 and february 2002, we operated upon 75 patients with adult atrial septal defect
(asd), adult ventricular septal defect (vsd), rheumatic
heart valve disease, and coronary disease using cpb.
the average age of the patients and the male–female
ratio were 42.4 (17 to 72) and 1 : 1.5 (29/46), respectively. the patients were divided into two groups, i.e.,
the study group (n = 40) and control group (n = 35).
both groups had got no major risk factor as the diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking except high
cholesterol level. neither surgeon nor the other investigators knew the groups. the same surgeon using same

techniques operated upon both the groups. prime solution was composed of lactate ringer (20 cc/kg), sodium
bicarbonate (1 meq/kg), prednol (1 mg/kg), and mannitol (20 mg/kg) in both the groups. we used cold blood
cardioplegia mixed with st. thomas’ hospital ii  xxxd2988xxx  solution (st. thomas/blood = 14 ) in the control
group. ptx (500 mg/l) was added into this  xxxd2988xxx 
solution in the study group. the average extracorporeal
circulation time was 125 minutes in the study group and
115 minutes in the control group. the average x-clamp
time was 75 minutes in the study group and 80 minutes
in the control group.
the il-6, il-8, and blood tnf-alpha were studied to compare the groups. these parameters were investigated
in the coronary sinus blood samples, which were obtained using retrograde canula in 30th minute during
x-clamp and in 5th minute after releasing it.
the il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha levels were determined
with chemiluminescence enzyme immunometric assays on an immulite immunoassay analyser (immulite
il-6, il-8, tnf-alpha assays, dpc, los angeles, ca, usa).
in these assays, the chemiluminescent substrate a
phosphate ester of adamantyl dioxetane, undergoes
hydrolysis in the presence of alkaline phosphatase and
results in the sustained emission of light.
analytical sensitivity of il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha assays
was 1, 2, and 1.7 pg/ml, and lower reportable ranges
were 5, 5, and 4 pg/ml, respectively. control sera ilco
10009 and ilc0 20009 were included in each analytic
run. intra- and interassay precision performances of the
assays that were determined on 10 replicates in a single run and 20 different runs, respectively, yielded coefficients of variation within 3.4% to 8.8% at 13.3 and
31.4 pg/ml concentrations for il-6, at 117.0 and 584.0
pg/ml concentrations for il-8, and at 65.0 and 281.0
pg/ml concentrations for tnf-alpha.
to evaluate the tissue tnf-alpha level, the biopsy was
taken from the right atrial appendix where the venous
canula was inserted in both groups after the pump, and
all biopsies were kept in formalin.
the tissue samples were stained for tissue
tnf-alpha with immunohystochemical streptavidine-biotin
method. five micrometer tissue sections were placed

on the adhesive slides (poly-l- xxxd2528xxx , sigma no p 8920)
and microwaved with antigen retrieval solution for 10
minutes. the monoclonal antibodies to tnf-alpha (neomarkers ms 1073, usa) was used for immunohistochemical staining of the sections. streptavidin-biotin,
horseradish peroksidase method (dako, lsab 2, k
0675) and dab chromogene was used for immunohistochemical staining. the sections were washed with
phosphate buffer solution (pbs) to prevent drying. finally, mayer’s hematoxylin was used as counterstain.
to control the myocardial tissues stained, we used the
tonsil tissue macrophages that were recommended on
the data sheet of neomarkers ms 1073, also transsuctioned in the antigen retrival solutions in the same time
with the myocardial preparats.
we observed light and dark brown area in the stoplasmic tonsil tissue macrophages as the myocardial
tissue at the light microscopic examination. brown area
contained tissue tnf-alpha, and nucleus were stained with
blue and violet.
we also compared hemodynamic data, arrhythmia incidence, coagulation-bleeding time, daily drainage, and
myocardial perfusion syntigraphy that were examined
both pre- and postoperatively. postoperative myocardial perfusion syntigraphies of both groups were performed on the third day after operation.

results
in the evaluation of the results, we used nonparemetric wilcoxon test. the il-6, il-8, and blood tnf-alpha
levels of both groups measured during x-clamp were

not different (p > 0.05). but observed il-6, il-8, and
blood tnf-alpha levels of both groups after releasing xclamp were statistically different (p < 0.005) (figs. 1–3)
(table 1).
following pathological examination, it was observed
that the amount of tissue tnf-alpha of study group was
also much more lower than control group (figs. 4
and 5).
arrhythmia incidence of the study group was found
to be better than the control group, although there
was no difference in the myocardial perfusion syntigraphy, hemodynamic data, coagulation-bleeding time,
and daily drainage. arrhythmia observing ratio was 40%
and the arrhythmia types were atrial extrasistol, atrial
fibrillation, ventricular extrasistol, and ventricular tachicardy in the control group. the same ratio was 25% in
the study group. this result was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
conclusions
during a cardiopulmonary bypass operation, the
metabolites that are produced as results of inflammation and i/r injury, damage the myocardium. with the
activation of 5 - xxxg1612xxx  enzyme in the ischemia phase of
the tissue, atp is converted to amp and imp, adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine. meanwhile, ca++ accumulates within the cell due to the altered ion balance. during the reperfusion period, the reaction of
hypoxanthine with the accumulated ca++ results in
the formation of reactive oxygen metabolites within
the cell.5 reperfusion of the ischemic tissue increases
the concentrations of chemotactic factors, such as lipid
mediators, polypeptide mediators, and immune complexes.6,7 chemotactic factors attract monocytes, polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pnl), and macrophages to
the environment.
an inflammatory reaction occurs as a result of pnl
accumulation in the tissue. the pnls that migrate to

the tissue as a result of the inflammatory process initiate the tissue damage by triggering several reactions.11
migration of pnls is with increased endothelial damage and permeability.
pnls that accumulate in the tissue secrete
myeloperoxidase, which produces hydroxychloride
(hocl). hocl has a direct cytotoxic effect and by inactivating  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -protease inhibitor, it participates in the
production of collagenases and elastases from the
pnls.12-14
the pnls that are in the environment favor the secretion of proinflamatory cytokines such as il-6, il-8, and
tnf-alpha.15 in the study by türköz et al., it is reported that
ptx, by inhibiting the pnl activation in the lungs, prevented the accumulation of the cells, thereby reduced
the damage to the lungs by having exerted such an effect on the pnls.16 kleinschmidt et al. stated that ptx
could decrease endothelial damage and permeability.1
it also protects the mitochondria structures of the cell
at the same time.17
the animal and human myocardial studies have
demonstrated that high-energy phosphate depletion
during ischemia has been correlated with poor postischemic recovery of cardiac function.18,19 although myocytes retain the ability to salvage and resynthesize
high-energy phosphate compounds despite severe ischemia this resynthesis capability limited by purine precursors availability.19,20
the cardiac enzyme 5 - xxxg1612xxx  found in plasma membrane, cytosol, and lysosomes of myocytes, catalyzes
nucleotide breakdown by dephosphorylating amp to
adenosine and imp to inosine.6,7,21 both adenosine
and inosine are freely diffusable from mycocytes
and become unavailable for nucleotide resynthesis on
reperfusion washout.22 the break down of atp into diffusible forms during ischemia is a key factor limiting the
functional recovery of the myocardium following reperfusion. adenosine, when given during ischemia, has

been shown to enhance the recovery of myocardium
following ischemia and reperfusion.8
ptx exerts its effect by inhibiting the activity of 5 - xxxg1612xxx 
enzyme. it prevents the evolution of future metabolic
chains that have potential hazards, while preserving
the energy stores, which will be required at the time
of reperfusion. this shows us that ptx could be used
during cardiopulmonary bypass for the purpose of protecting the myocardium.2,8-10,15 ptx also inhibits the
production of proinflammatory cytokines, have antiinflammatory properties, and decreases tissue injury by
exerting its effect at different steps of this metabolic
chain,2 so that measuring the il-6, il-8, tnf-alpha are
parameters of inflammation and i/r injury.9,10,22-26 in
our study, to detect the effects of ptx, we used parameters such as il-6, il-8, blood and tissue tnf-alpha
levels.
yashiki sava et al. reported that in the inflammated
tissue, il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha levels have been increased
during i/r.9 various reports have been published concerning the cpb-caused enhancement of inflammatory
cytokine production. kawamura and steinberg reported
that il-6 levels increase during cpb and decrease after
the end of cpb.24,25 similar changes in levels of il-8
have also been reported by kawamura, finn, laouar
and their associates.24,26,27 cain, et al. have also supported the above trial reporting levels of tnf-alpha in their
study.10 inflammation and ischemic changes occur at
the beginning of cpbp and arrive the peak level within
20 minutes, recovery time start as soon as after relasing of x-clamp.28 these findings indicate that these
inflammatory cytokines involved in the acute-phase reactions serve as promoters of cpb-associated inflammation. that is why we took the coronary sinus blood
in the 30th minute during x-clamp and in the 5th minute
after releasing it. sliwa and associates reported that ptx
reduces high plasma concentrations of tnf-alpha and improves symptoms and left ventricular systolic function
in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.29 in
the levine’s study, it has been explained that adenosine pretreatment decreases i/r induced rat myocardial tnf-alpha.23 ptx also decreases endothelial injury and
leukocyte infiltration to vascular endothelium in cardiopulmonary bypass.30,31
the relationship of the increase of these cytokines to
cpb-associated injury of organs in the clinical situation
had only been reported by laouar and co-workers.27
they reported that il-8 levels were reduced by methylprednisolone.
in our study, ptx added into the  xxxd2988xxx  solution
not only reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines
and tnf-alpha in the coronary sinus blood but also reduced
accumulation of tnf-alpha in the myocardium. these results support our hypothesis that ptx decreases the inflammatory response of myocardium and provides lasting power to myocardium.
above reactions are formed in acute-phase, and their
results are observed preoperatively or on early postoperative time.23 that is why we observed that arrhythmia incidence of study group was much better than
control group preoperatively and in the early postoperative period. we also did not observe the difference be-

tween the myocardial perfusion syntigraphies of both
groups that were taken on the third postoperative day.
we investigated inflammatory reaction of myocardium
and i/r injury that occurred during cardiopulmonary bypass, so that myocardial syntigraphy might have not
shown the lesion because it was taken in the late period.
coagulation–bleeding time and daily drainage were
not different in both groups. szefner et al. also reported
that ptx does not increase the risk of bleeding and it
also does not change the coagulation and the bleeding
times.32
in conclusion, ptx can play an important role in the
prevention of myocardial damages that occur during
the cardiopulmonary bypass.
