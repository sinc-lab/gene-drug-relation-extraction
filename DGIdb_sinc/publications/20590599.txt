background and purpose: there are two important properties of receptor–ligand interactions: affinity (the ability of the
ligand to bind to the receptor) and efficacy (the ability of the receptor–ligand complex to induce a response). ligands are
classified as agonists or antagonists depending on whether or not they have efficacy. in theory, it is possible to develop selective
agonists based on selective affinity, selective intrinsic efficacy or both. this study examined the affinity and intrinsic efficacy of
31 b-adrenoceptor agonists at the three human b-adrenoceptors to determine whether the current agonists are subtype
selective because of affinity or intrinsic efficacy.
experimental approach: stable clonal cho-k1 cell lines, transfected with either the human b1, b2 or b3-adrenoceptor, were
used, and whole-cell [3h]-cgp 12177 radioligand binding and [3h]-camp accumulation were measured.
key results: several agonists were found to be highly subtype selective because of selective affinity (e.g. salmeterol and
 xxxd2155xxx , for the b2-adrenoceptor over the b1 or b3), while others (e.g.  xxxd2398xxx ) had little affinity–selectivity. however, the
intrinsic efficacy of salmeterol,  xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd2398xxx  was similar across all three receptor subtypes. other ligands (e.g.
denopamine for b1; clenbuterol, az 40140d, salbutamol for b2) were found to have subtype-selective intrinsic efficacy. several
ligands appeared to activate two agonist conformations of the b1- and b3-adrenoceptors.
conclusions and implications: there are agonists with subtype selectivity based upon both selective affinity and selective
intrinsic efficacy. therefore, there is scope to develop better selective agonists based upon both selective affinity and selective
intrinsic efficacy.

there are two important properties of receptor–ligand interactions: affinity (the ability of the ligand to bind to the receptor) and efficacy (the ability of the receptor–ligand complex to
induce a response; strange, 2008). ligands are classified as

agonists or antagonists depending on whether or not they
have efficacy (clarke and bond, 1998; strange, 2008). thus, a
neutral antagonist binds to a given receptor but does not
stimulate a response (i.e. it has affinity, but no efficacy). the
affinity of antagonist ligands can be measured directly from
radioligand binding or from antagonism of agonist responses
in functional assays (strange, 2008). thus, the selectivity of
antagonist drugs, either between receptors or between receptor subtypes, is relatively easily determined (e.g. büscher et al.,
1996; smith and teitler, 1999; hoffmann et al., 2004; baker,
2005a). subtype-selective antagonist drugs have been sought
for many clinical areas with the expected benefit that a high
target receptor selectivity increases clinical effectiveness while
reducing clinical side effects (clarke and bond, 1998).
in reality, many ligands considered as antagonists actually
do stimulate responses, either by reducing the basal response
( xxxd1422xxx  in systems with constitutive activity) or by
stimulating a small response on their own (partial agonist).
truly neutral antagonists are few and far between, and a great
many ‘antagonist’ drugs in clinical use are either inverse agonists or very weak partial agonists (e.g. baker et al., 2003a,b;
kenakin, 2004 and examples in this study).
measurements of agonist selectivity are more complex
because agonists bind (and so have affinity), as well as being
able to induce a response (efficacy; kenakin, 1999a). thus, the
selectivity for agonist ligands between receptors or receptor
subtypes depends upon these two variables, and it is theoretically possible to have subtype-selective agonists by different
mechanisms. a ligand with higher affinity for a given receptor
subtype would appear selective even if its efficacy was similar
across different subtypes. similarly, a ligand would appear as a
subtype-selective agonist if its efficacy at a certain receptor
subtype was significantly greater even if its affinity were the
same across the other subtypes.
agonist affinity can be measured in the same manner as
that for antagonist ligands (e.g. binding studies); however, the
response an agonist induces depends upon at least six factors:
affinity, efficacy, number of receptors present, efficiency of the
receptor–effector coupling, effector response measured and
any desensitization that occurs within the time-frame of the
measurement (kenakin, 1999a; 2002). many of these factors
alter between different cells, tissues and organisms, and
between responses measured within the same tissue. ligand
affinity and ligand efficacy are, however, considered to
depend upon the chemical interaction between the ligand
and receptor, and are thus considered to be independent of
the cells/tissues/organisms under study. therefore, this
chemical ability of a certain ligand to induce a response has
been termed ‘intrinsic efficacy’, and is a measure of molecular
efficacy for a given ligand at a given receptor, rather than at a
tissue or organism level (furchgott, 1966; clarke and bond,
1998).
intrinsic efficacy is therefore an important property, and
although direct measurements are difficult, relative intrinsic
efficacies can be compared across different agonists if the
other variables are controlled for. for example, using a stable
cell line or single tissue preparation, and measuring a single
response remove any tissue variables (including receptor
expression level), and thus the differences in the response
seen are due to those of ligand affinity and intrinsic efficacy.

thus, in a single system, partial agonists can be ranked in
order of efficacy by the proportion of the maximal response
they stimulate (kenakin, 1999a; strange, 2008). for full agonists, the intrinsic efficacy of ligands in the same system can
be compared by means of an ‘efficacy ratio’ (kd/ec50; furchgott, 1966; kenakin, 1982; 1999b; strange, 2008). for
example, a ligand with an affinity (kd) of 100 nm, but an
agonist response ec50 value of 1 nm has an intrinsic efficacy
ratio of 100. this ligand would have a higher intrinsic efficacy
than a ligand with a kd of 100 nm and an ec50 value of 10 nm
(ratio of 10), provided both ligands were measured in the
same system.
this study examines these two variables (affinity and intrinsic efficacy) for a range of ligands to determine whether the
agonist ligands currently available are selective because of
selective affinity, selective intrinsic efficacy or both. the three
human b-adrenoceptors (alexander et al., 2008) have been
chosen because they are all gs-coupled gpcrs, and therefore
identical responses (camp) can be measured, and there is a
large range of b-adrenoceptor agonist ligands available.

protein) or the human b3-adrenoceptor (790 fmol·mg-1
protein) were used throughout this study (baker, 2005a).
parent cho cells were also used (i.e. cho cells without the
transfected receptor). cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium nutrient mix f12 (dmem/f12) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine in a 37°c
humidified 5% co2 : 95% air atmosphere.
[3h]-cgp 12177 whole-cell binding
cells were grown to confluence in white-sided, clearbottomed 96-well view plates. [3h]-cgp 12177 whole-cell
binding was carried out the following day in a manner identical to that described in baker (2005a). briefly, the medium
was removed from each well, and 100 ml of serum-free
medium containing the competing ligand at twice the final
required concentration was added to each well followed
immediately by a fixed concentration of [3h]-cgp 12177. the
cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°c, 5% co2. the cells were
washed twice by the addition and removal of 200 ml 4°c
phosphate-buffered saline; 100 ml microscint 20 was added to
each well, a white sticky base applied to the bottom of the
plate and a sealant top applied to the top of the plate. the
plates were left at room temperature overnight in the dark,
and the plates were counted on a topcount at 21°c for 2 min
per well.
[3h]-camp accumulation
cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. the medium
was removed and the cells were pre-labelled with [3h]-adenine
by incubation for 2 h with 2 mci· xxxg1167xxx  [3h]-adenine in serumfree medium (0.5 ml per well). the [3h]-adenine was removed,
and each well was washed by the addition and removal of 1 ml
serum-free medium. then, 1 ml serum-free medium containing 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx  was added to each well, and the cells were
incubated for 15 min. agonist (in 10 ml serum-free medium)
was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for
10 min–5 h. the reaction was terminated by the addition of
50 ml concentrated hcl per well. the plates were then frozen,
thawed and [3h]-camp separated from other 3h-nucleotides by
sequential dowex and alumina column chromatography, as
previously described (donaldson et al., 1988).
data analysis
whole-cell binding. all data points on each binding curve
were performed in triplicate, and each 96-well plate also contained three to six determinations of total and non-specific
binding. non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm cgp 20712a or 1–10 mm propranolol for the
b1-adrenoceptor, 1 mm ici 118551 or 1–10 mm propranolol for
the b2-adrenoceptor and 10 mm propranolol for the
b3-adrenoceptor. in all cases where a kd value is stated, the
competing ligand completely inhibited the specific binding of
[3h]-cgp 12177.
one-site competition binding. a one-site sigmoidal binding
curve (equation 1) was then fitted to the data using graphpad
prism 2.01, and the ic50 was then determined as the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the specific binding.

where a is the concentration of the competing ligand, ic50 is
the concentration at which half of the specific binding of
[3h]-cgp 12177 has been inhibited and ns is the non-specific
binding.
from the ic50 value and the known concentration of radioligand ([3h]-cgp 12177 conc), a kd (concentration at which
half the receptors are bound by the competing ligand) value
was calculated using the equation:

kd =

(1 + [

[ 3 h] -cgp 12177 )

(2)

two-site competition binding. several of the responses were
best fitted to a two-site competition curve (e.g. figure 2c). in
these cases, equation 3 was used:

% inhibition of specific binding =

[ a] × n
[ a] × (100 − n )
+
([ a] + ic150 )
([ a] + ic250 )
(3)

where n is the percentage of site 1, [a] is the concentration of
agonist and ic150 and ic250 are the respective ic50 values for
the two agonist sites.
[3h]-camp accumulation. most agonist responses were best
described by a one-site sigmoidal concentration–response
curve (equation 4):

response =

emax × [ a]
ec50 + [ a]

(4)

where emax is the maximum response, [a] is the agonist concentration and ec50 is the concentration of agonist that produces 50% of the maximal response.
several of the responses were, however, best fitted to a
two-site concentration response – equation 5 (e.g. figure 5a):

% maximal stimulation =

[ a] × n
[ a] × (100 − n )
+
(5)
([ a] + ec150 )
([ a] + ec250 )

where n is the percentage of site 1, [a] is the concentration of
agonist and ec150 and ec250 are the respective ec50 values for
the two agonist sites.
 xxxd2398xxx  (10 mm) was included in all experiments, and
therefore all maximal responses are expressed as a percentage
of this maximum.
efficacy ratios. for comparative purposes, efficacy ratios were
calculated by dividing the kd value by the ec50 value for each
ligand as per method of furchgott (1966).

results
[3h]-cgp 12177 whole-cell binding
the kd values for [3h]-cgp 12177 have previously been determined in these cell lines as 0.42 nm for the b1-adrenoceptor,
0.17 nm for the b2-adrenoceptor and 109.2 nm for the
b3-adrenoceptor (baker, 2005a).

values represent mean ⫾ sem of n separate experiments. the binding of four ligands to the human b3-adrenoceptor was best described by a two-component curve.
in these instances, the log kd values are given for each component along with the percentage of the total inhibition that was represented by the first component.
ligands are arranged in order of b1 versus b2 selectivity.

h-cgp 12177 at concentrations from 0.34 to 4.65 nm was
used for experiments involving the b1- and b2-adrenoceptors,
and from 5.18 to 32.53 nm for the b3-adrenoceptor.
the affinity of ligands for the human b-adrenoceptors is
presented in table 1, arranged in order of selectivity for the b1over the b2-adrenoceptor (tables 1 and 2). thus, several compounds originally considered as antagonists were found to
have high affinity for the receptors, while as expected most
ligands generally considered as agonists had relatively low
affinity. table 2 shows the selectivity of these ligands for the
three adrenoceptors based on binding alone.  xxxd2704xxx  was

found to be the most selective ligand for the human
b1-adrenoceptor in this current set of ligands (table 2);
however, the neutral antagonist cgp 20712a has previously
been shown to have 501 times higher affinity for the b1- than
for the b2-adrenoceptor in this system (baker, 2005a). salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  were the most selective b2-compounds
(figure 1). there were several b3-selective compounds (e.g. az
40140d, l 755507, l 748337 and tak 677); however, careful
examination of their [3h]-cgp 12177 inhibitory responses
yielded an inhibition that was best described by a twocomponent curve (figure 2).

where the inhibition of [3h]-cgp 12177 binding curve was best described by two components (table 1), the selectivity ratio for the first component only is given.

remained constant over time for the great majority of ligands
tested including full and partial agonists (supporting information tables s2–s4; figure 3) as found previously (baker
et al., 2004). however, for some ligands, the log ec50 values
differed between 10 and 30 min (figure 4). for some ligands
[e.g. salmeterol,  xxxd2155xxx  and cgp 12177 (b2)], this is most
probably because of the slow onset of these ligands at this
receptor (lötvall, 2001; baker et al., 2002), and indeed the
degree of change reflects the known relative order of onset of
action (cote et al., 2009). the reason for the increase in
potency for all three catecholamines between 10 and 30 min
is not known; however, given this change for both the long
acting ligands and the catecholamines, 30 min was chosen as
the incubation time for investigation of majority of the other
ligands (tables 3–5).
the percentage maximum response obtained was the same
for the ligands at each receptor at each time-point. however,

the counts collected after 5 h agonist incubation were greater
than those after 30 min incubation, thus allowing a bigger
window to examine the small responses. weak partial agonists and those with a two-component agonist response
curves were therefore incubated for 5 h to allow more accurate measurement (with no change in either log ec50 values or
percentage maximum response obtained).
many of the agonists stimulated full (as compared to  xxxd2398xxx ) concentration–response curves. however, many
ligands often considered as ‘antagonists’ stimulated partial
agonist responses (e.g.  xxxd2704xxx , cyanopindolol,  xxxd431xxx ,
 xxxd2812xxx  and bucindolol) (tables 3–5, arranged in order of
‘efficacy ratio’ for each receptor). for the human b1- and
b3-adrenoceptors, several of these partial agonist responses
were found to best fit a two-component concentration–
response curve (e.g. figures 5 and 6). this is similar to previous findings which suggest that the first high-affinity

discussion
several recent studies have examined the selectivity (affinity)
of b-antagonists for the b-adrenoceptors in different recombinant cell systems, and concluded that many clinically available b-blockers are not very selective (smith and teitler, 1999;
schnabel et al., 2000; hoffmann et al., 2004; baker, 2005a).
this study set out to examine the binding and function of
b-adrenoceptor agonists, measured under similar conditions,
to determine if agonists are subtype selective and whether it
was affinity or intrinsic efficacy that made them so. wholecell techniques were used, as this is how agonists would
behave in the clinical situation (i.e. with gtp present in living
british journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1048–1061

cells). this probably means that measured kd values obtained
from binding represent the binding affinity for the basal r
state of the receptor (rather than the r* state; leff, 1995; leff
et al., 1997).
the affinity measurements can be compared across the
three cell lines, as affinity from ligand binding is a direct
measure. from these studies, it can be seen that several very
selective b2- and b3-agonists exist on the basis of affinity;
however, there are few b1-selective agonists. competition
binding curves were all best described by a one-site sigmoidal
response curve for the human b1- and b2-adrenoceptors;
however, az 40140d, l 755507, l 748337 and tak 677 were
found to have a two-component displacement curve (table 1;
figure 2). the human b3-receptor has previously been suggested to exist in at least two agonist conformations (baker,
2005b), and it may be that this represents binding to two
different agonist conformations of this receptor. the
b1-adrenoceptor also exists in at least two conformations (pak

this probably explains why [3h]-cgp 12177 at the concentrations used only demonstrated binding to one conformation at
the b1-adrenoceptor. as several gpcrs have allosteric functions, it is also possible that there is a degree of allosteric
interference from the radioligand or the competing agonist
affecting the binding of the other.

recent evidence has also shown that the functional
response measured from a given receptor–ligand interaction
can vary depending on which cellular response is being measured. for example, propranolol acts as an  xxxd1422xxx  at
the human b2-adrenoceptor by decreasing camp production
below basal, but at the same time stimulates the erk pathway
(e.g. azzi et al., 2003; baker et al., 2003b). thus, the binding of
a ligand (e.g. adrenaline) may generate a plethora of active
‘states’ of the receptor, some of which may be coupled to
different g-proteins or intracellular effector mechanisms (e.g.

b-adrenoceptor agonist selectivity
jg baker

b-arrestin), and these in turn may have different allosteric
influences on the receptor itself. as the human
b-adrenoceptors are all gs-coupled receptors, the robust,
gs-coupled, rapid upstream camp response was used as a
measure of functional efficacy in this study. as the whole-cell
binding assay and the camp accumulation assay were both
performed in the same confluent intact living cells, the ‘states’
of the receptor induced by the competing ligand (e.g. adrenaline) in the binding assay would be the same ‘states’ as those
induced by the same ligand measured in the camp assay.
however, the binding assay will only detect the state that
[3h]-cgp 12177 is able to bind to. thus, the [3h]-cgp 12177
binding assay might not detect all of the active states generated by the binding of the agonist (e.g. adrenaline). the camp
assay measured the response generated from the plethora of
states generated from, for example, adrenaline. so, although
adrenaline will generate the same plethora of states in both
assays, potentially, the group of states detected in the binding
assay might not overlap completely with the states that
induce the production of camp. there is however likely to be
substantial overlap as [3h]-cgp 12177 is completely displaceable by virtually all the ligands (table 1), and cgp 12177 itself
stimulates a camp response (supporting information
tables s2–s4).
when examining the camp responses, several things must
be considered before comparisons are made. three different
cell lines have been used (one for each receptor), and each has
a different receptor expression level and, because they are
different cell lines, will have different effector coupling efficiencies. direct comparisons of functional responses across
the three cell lines are therefore not possible. however, a rank
order of intrinsic efficacy can be determined from a ratio
between affinity (kd from binding) and the ec50 from the
functional response (furchgott, 1966; kenakin, 1982; 1999b;
strange, 2008). thus, at the b1-adrenoceptor,  xxxd2098xxx  (log kd
-5.04, log ec50 -7.53) has an ‘intrinsic efficacy ratio’ of 309
(log 2.49), and salbutamol has an intrinsic efficacy ratio of
33.9 (log 1.53). therefore,  xxxd2098xxx  has c. 10-fold more intrinsic efficacy at the human b1-adrenoceptor than salbutamol.
thus, although intrinsic efficacy has not been measured
directly, a meaningful measure has been obtained to allow
comparison between ligands.
tables 3–5 are arranged in order of intrinsic efficacy for each
receptor. at the top of the table are full agonists with the
highest intrinsic efficacy. as the intrinsic efficacy of the
ligands decreases, there comes a stage when they are no
longer efficacious enough to stimulate a maximum response.
the maximum responses then decrease until there is no
response at all (as for  xxxd2704xxx  at b2- and b3-receptors). here,
 xxxd2704xxx  is a neutral antagonist at these receptors in this
assay. this pattern is as would be predicted (kenakin, 1999b;
strange, 2008), but there are some notable exceptions (butoxamine and methoxyphenamine at b1, bucindolol at b2 and
 xxxd2812xxx  and bucindolol at b3).
in addition, the agonist concentration–response curves are
not always best described by a one-site sigmoidal response
curve. several agonist concentration–response curves at both
the human b1- and b3-adrenoceptors are best described by a
two-component response. this is similar to previous findings (walter et al., 1984; baker et al., 2003a; baker, 2005b)

1059

where both of these receptors (but as yet not the human
b2-adrenoceptor) have been described as having at least two
active agonist conformations (pak and fishman, 1996; granneman, 2001; arch, 2004; kaumann and molenaar, 2008).
interestingly, some compounds appear to bind to or induce
two conformations of the receptor, while others stimulate a
two-component response, and l 748337 is best described by
a two-component response in both binding and [3h]-camp
accumulation. ligands are known to have different affinities
and different efficacies for the two sites (agonist or antagonist; baker et al., 2003a; baker, 2005b,c), so the differences
probably represent ligands binding to the two components
with similar affinity, but one conformation being more
functionally active (efficacious) than the other and vice
versa.
finally, comparisons of the rank order of ligands for the
three different receptors provide information about relative
intrinsic efficacies.  xxxd2098xxx  is a full and efficacious agonist at
the b1-adrenoceptor, ranking third out of the agonists studied.
it was also a full agonist at the b2- and b3-adrenoceptors with
the highest intrinsic efficacy (i.e. top of tables 4 and 5, rank
1). thus,  xxxd2098xxx  is a full agonist with high intrinsic efficacy
across all three b-adrenoceptors. likewise, baam is a partial
agonist at all three receptors, with rankings of 37, 34 and 36
at b1, b2 and b3, respectively, and can therefore be said to have
low intrinsic efficacy at all three receptors.
salmeterol appears very selective for the human
b2-adrenoceptor in the camp assay (log ec50 values of -7.03,
-9.89 and -6.60 for b1, b2 and b3 respectively). this could be
due to either selective affinity or selective intrinsic efficacy for
the b2-adrenoceptor over the other subtypes, or a mixture of
both. the affinity measurements (log kd values of -5.73, -9.26
and -6.33 for b1, b2 and b3, respectively), show that salmeterol
has high affinity for the b2-adrenoceptor. the intrinsic efficacy
of the compound is relatively poor in all cases (rank order 22
at b1, 21 at b2 and 33 at b3). thus, overall, salmeterol is a
highly selective b2-adrenoceptor agonist because of its higher
b2-affinity and not because of higher b2-intrinsic efficacy. a
similar reasoning can be applied to  xxxd2155xxx , although this
agonist has higher intrinsic efficacy at all three receptors (rank
6, 8 and 5 at b1, b2 and b3). this is similar to the finding of
kenakin and beek (1980) where prenaterol was found to have
equal intrinsic efficacy at b1- and b2-adrenoceptors.
of the agonists studied here, there was a general trend that
those with highest intrinsic efficacy were so across all three
receptor subtypes (i.e. at the top of tables 3–5, e.g.  xxxd2098xxx ,
terbutaline,  xxxd2583xxx  and adrenaline), and those with
lower intrinsic efficacy likewise tended to have it across all
three receptors (bottom of the tables). thus, the approximate
rank order of ligands is similar across all three receptors.
however, in order to examine this further, the efficacy ratios
(log kd/log ec50) were plotted for the receptors. figure 7a
(affinity values) shows that salmeterol has high selectivity for
b2-adrenoceptors based on affinity, whereas denopamine, az
40140d and  xxxd2398xxx  have little affinity-based selectivity.
figure 7b (efficacy ratios) shows that  xxxd2398xxx  and salmeterol are equally efficacious at the human b1- and
b2-adrenoceptors. denopamine is the most selective ligand for
b1-receptors, with regard to intrinsic activity and efficacy, and

figure 7 (a) plot of log kd for compounds from table 1 for human
b1- versus human b2-adrenoceptors. the line is through the origin
and represents equal affinity, so compounds occurring to the right
and below are b2-selective. thus, salmeterol can be seen to be highly
b2-selective based on affinity, whereas  xxxd2398xxx , denopamine and
az 40140d have little selectivity based on affinity. (b) plot of efficacy
values (log kd/log ec50) for the same compounds (taken from
tables 3 and 4). the line is that of best fit – the slope is not 1 nor does
it go though the origin as this represents a function of efficacy (i.e.
differences in cell line which include receptor number, receptor–
effector coupling, etc.). denopamine can be seen to be b1-selective
based on efficacy, whereas az 40140d is b2-selective, and  xxxd2398xxx  and salmeterol were non-selective based on efficacy.

kd (affinity beta 1)

there are two current theories on the matter of efficacy:
conformational selection and conformational induction
(clarke and bond, 1998; hunyady et al., 2003).
conformational selection suggests that receptors spontaneously exist in basal (r) and pre-determined active forms [r* in
two-state (leff, 1995) and r** in three-state models (leff et al.,
1997)] in the cell membranes that are in equilibrium with
each other. agonists bind with greater affinity to r* (or r**)
over r, and therefore reset the equilibrium with more r*
present, and hence a response is generated. here, intrinsic
efficacy is explained on the basis of selective affinity where
‘intrinsic efficacy’ is actually the ratio of affinity for r* over r.
conformational (or agonist) induction suggests that receptors
are in a basal state in the cell membrane, and the binding of
the ligand creates the agonist r* state of the receptor. here,
efficacy is the ability of the ligand to change the receptor
conformation. this model allows for an infinite number of
active receptor states, but suggests that there is something
distinct about the chemical interaction that gives some molecules the receptor-activating property of intrinsic efficacy.
however, both models suggest that it should be possible to
develop agonist ligands that are selective because of selective
intrinsic efficacy.
in conclusion, therefore, agonist ligands can, in theory,
appear selective for different receptor subtypes for different
reasons: selective binding affinity or selective intrinsic
efficacy. this study shows that some b-adrenoceptor agonists
(e.g. salmeterol) are highly selective purely because of selective binding affinity. others have very similar affinity but
appear subtype selective because of a degree of selective
intrinsic efficacy. thus, it is possible to develop selective
ligands based on either affinity or intrinsic efficacy, and
there is therefore scope for the development of better, more
selective agonists with both of these properties.

are more selective for the b2-adrenoceptor than the b1adrenoceptor based on intrinsic activity and efficacy. although
difficult to directly compare, the selectivity based on affinity
appears to be greater than the selectivity based on efficacy.
