arsenite, the inorganic trivalent arsenic compound, is a potent human carcinogen with significant worldwide exposure
through natural contamination of food and drinking water (1).
epidemiological studies have shown that chronic arsenic exposure is associated with an increased incidence of skin, lung, and
bladder cancers (1, 2). at the present arsenic regulatory standard of 50 ppb in drinking water, issued by the united states
environmental protection agency in 1942, the cancer risk due
to arsenic contamination is estimated to be comparable with
that of environmental tobacco smoke or radon in homes (3). a
recent analysis conducted by the national academy of sciences
indicated that the risk of lung and bladder cancer from arsenic

in drinking water is several times higher than that estimated
by the environmental protection agency when it developed its
10-ppb standard (projected to go into effect in 2006). according
to the new analysis, at the arsenic standard of 10 ppb in
drinking water, the combined lifetime risk of lung and bladder
cancer is between 30 and 37 per 10,000 people (4). in fact,
⬃350,000 individuals in the united states drink water containing arsenic levels higher than 50 ppb (3). in many developing
countries, arsenic contamination in drinking water can be as
high as 1,800 ppb and represents a very serious threat to public
health (1, 5).
although epidemiological studies have long established that
arsenite is potently carcinogenic, the underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. two plausible models have been
proposed to explain the carcinogenic actions of arsenic. according to the first and more controversial model, arsenite would
cause genetic abnormalities affecting chromosome structure
without directly interacting with dna (6 – 8). in the second
model, arsenite is proposed to act as a tumor promoter (6, 9).
the latter hypothesis is supported by the findings that arsenite
can induce anchorage independence in human diploid fibroblasts (10), enhance cell proliferation in bladder epithelium in
mice (11), and potentiate the mutagenic effects of short wavelength ultraviolet (uvc) radiation in cultured cells (12–14).
consistent with the notion that arsenite acts on signaling
pathways that regulate cell proliferation, a number of proliferation-associated genes, notably the proto-oncogenes c-fos and
c-jun, have been found to be induced rapidly in response to
arsenite (9, 11, 15). both proto-oncogenes encode components of
the mitogen-inducible immediate-early transcription factor
ap-1 and have been implicated in promoting cell proliferation
by affecting g1 to s-phase progression. moreover, it is well
established that the abnormal expression of both c-fos and
c-jun can induce cell transformation (16). recently, c-jun induction in response to proliferative stimuli was shown further
to be critical for the down-regulation of both the  xxxg2313xxx  and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/
waf-1/ xxxg418xxx  (17). therefore, perturbation of the expression of
c-fos and c-jun by arsenic compounds is likely to play an important role in carcinogenesis.
the signal transduction pathways that regulate c-fos and
c-jun transcription have been thoroughly investigated. the mitogen-activated protein (map)1 kinase pathway plays a crucial
role in the induction of both c-fos and c-jun in response to many

although epidemiological studies have long established that inorganic arsenic is a potent human carcinogen, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. recent studies suggest that inorganic arsenic
may act as a tumor promoter by perturbing key signaling transduction pathways. we have shown previously
that arsenite can potently activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and induce the expression of proliferation-associated genes, including protooncogenes c-jun and c-fos. in order to elucidate further
the molecular mechanisms underlying its tumor-promoting properties, we investigated the signaling events
involved in arsenite-mediated induction of c-fos and  xxxg1222xxx . we found that induction of both c-fos and c-jun by
arsenite can be substantially inhibited by the mekselective inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx , suggesting that the erk
pathway is critically involved in their up-regulation.
interestingly, arsenite dramatically induced the phosphorylation and acetylation of histone h3 preceding the
induction of mrnas encoding c-fos and c-jun. finally,
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that
arsenite treatment markedly induced the phosphorylation/acetylation of histone h3 associated with the c-fos
and c-jun genes through an erk-dependent pathway.
our results strongly suggest that arsenic-triggered alterations in chromatin structure perturb specific gene
transcription, including that of proto-oncogenes c-jun
and c-fos, and may thereby contribute to the carcinogenic process.

c-fos and c-jun chromatin remodeling by arsenite

experimental procedures

cell culture and treatment—early passage wi-38 human diploid
fibroblast cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyclone, logan, ut).
subconfluent cultures were rendered quiescent by incubating the cells
in minimum essential medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for
36 h prior to treatment. sodium arsenite (sigma) and  xxxd3426xxx  a
(tsa, sigma) were directly added to the medium.  xxxd3462xxx  (promega,
madison, wi),  xxxd3177xxx  (sigma), sb202190 (calbiochem), pd169316
(calbiochem) and  xxxg1368xxx  inhibitor (p38 inh, calbiochem)
were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  and added to the medium to a final
concentration of 10 ␮m 15 min prior to treatment.
northern blot analysis—total rna was isolated with stat-60 (teltest b, friendswood, tx) and northern blot analysis performed as
described previously (23). messenger rnas encoding c-fos and c-jun
were detected using probes derived from either the human est clone
ai684077 or a cdna fragment of human c-jun kindly provided by j.
woodgett (see ref. 24), respectively. to monitor differences in loading
and transfer among samples, blots were stripped and rehybridized with
an end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the 18 s rrna.
antibodies, western blotting, and immunofluorescence—to analyze
the phosphorylation status of various map kinases, western blotting
was performed as described previously (23) using 20 ␮g of total cell
lysate. rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing phospho-p38, total p38,
and phospho- xxxd1355xxx /p42 erk map kinases were from cell signaling
(beverly, ma). a mouse monoclonal antibody against  xxxd1355xxx /p42 erk was
from transduction laboratories (lexington, ky). to detect the modification of histone h3, crude histone proteins were extracted using  xxxd3258xxx  (23) and then analyzed by western blotting using rabbit
polyclonal antibodies recognizing either phospho-histone h3 (ser(p)-10)
(cell signaling), phosphoacetyl-histone h3 (ser(p)-10/ac-lys-14, upstate biotechnology, inc., lake placid, ny), phospho-histone  xxxg1009xxx 
(p-ser-139, upstate biotechnology, inc.), acetyl-histone h3 (ac-lys-14,
upstate biotechnology, inc.), acetyl-histone h3 (ac-lys-9,14, upstate
biotechnology, inc.), or a rabbit antibody recognizing total histone h3
(cell signaling).
for the immunofluorescence studies, alexa 488-conjugated goat antirabbit and alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(molecular probes, eugene, or) were used according to the manufacturer’s specifications. phospho-histone h3 was detected using a rabbit
polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing phosphorylated (ser-10) histone h3 (cell signaling). total histone h3 was detected using a mouse
monoclonal antibody (25). dapi staining was performed as described
previously (26). samples were visualized by either fluorescence microscopy (carl zeiss, new york) or confocal microscopy (zeiss lsm-410

inverted confocal microscope equipped with a 63⫻ na 1.4 oil immersion
objective). the confocal pinhole was set to obtain a spatial resolution of
0.4 ␮m in the horizontal plane and 1 ␮m in the axial dimension. image
processing and presentation were done using matamorph 4.6.3 software (universal imaging, inc., west chester, pa).
erk,  xxxg1373xxx /3, and msk1 activity assays—msk1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a polyclonal antibody (upstate
biotechnology, inc.), and its activity was determined by assessing the
phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide (crosstide) in the presence of
[␥-32p]atp (23). erk activity was determined by immune complex
kinase assays using  xxxg1383xxx  (mbp, sigma) as a substrate
as described previously (26).  xxxg1373xxx /3 activity was determined by
immunocomplex kinase assays using recombinant  xxxg1104xxx  (25-kda heatshock protein, stressgen, vancouver, canada) as a substrate as described previously (27).
chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) and real time pcr—chromatin was cross-linked using formaldehyde and broken down to fragments with an average size of ⬃2 kbp through brief sonication according to clayton et al. (20). the resulting chromatin solution was divided
equally into four fractions that were subsequently used for isolating
input dna (fraction 1) or performing chip assays (fractions 2– 4).
chromatin solutions were first incubated for 2 h at 4 °c with 10 ␮l of
rabbit pre-immune serum or with 10 ␮l of purified antibody specifically
recognizing phospho-histone h3 (ser(p)-10) or 40 ␮l of purified antibody specifically recognizing phospho-acetylhistone h3 (ser(p)-10/aclys-14, upstate biotechnology, inc.). bovine  xxxg124xxx  (final concentration 200 ␮g/ml), sonicated ␭ phage dna (5 ␮g), and protein
a-sepharose beads (amersham biosciences) were added to the solutions and incubated overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °c. the beads
were washed extensively as described previously (23). the resulting
immunoprecipitates or input chromatin solutions were then incubated
with  xxxg1963xxx  (50 ␮g/ml) for 1 h at 37 °c and then digested for 16 h
using proteinase k (100 ␮g/ml). the input and immunoprecipitated
chromatin were incubated at 65 °c for ⱖ6 h to reverse the formaldehyde
cross-links. the dna was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 30 ␮l of water.
real time pcr was performed using sybr威 green pcr master mix
and geneamp威 5700 sequencing detection system (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) using the following parameters: 5 min at 50 °c,
10 min at 95 °c and then 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °c, 30 s),
annealing (60 °c, 30 s), and extension (72 °c, 30 s). primer pair
ggtctgcttccacgctttgcactgaattag and agcgcctttttacccttgtacggaaactg was used to amplify a 172-bp region in
the c-fos promoter. primer pair gggttgactggtagcagataagtgttgag and tctgggcagttagagagaaggtgaaaag was used to
amplify a 200-bp fragment in the human c-jun promoter. primer pair
ggcaaggtgaacgtggatgaagttggtg and ggagtggacagatccccaaaggactcaaag was used to amplify a 237-bp region in the
human ␤-globin gene.
after sybr green pcr amplification, data acquisition and subsequent data analyses were performed using the geneamp 5700 sequence
detection system (version 1.3). for all the amplifications described in
this paper, the threshold value of the ⌬rn was considered to be 0.5. the
pcr cycle where a statistically significant increase in the ⌬rn was first
detected is called the threshold cycle (ct). target dna copy number
and ct values are inversely related. the absolute levels of c-fos and
c-jun in the experimental samples were determined by extrapolating
the ct values from the standard curves of the genomic dna.
results

arsenite stimulates histone h3 phosphorylation/acetylation
and activates msk1—it has been shown that in mouse fibroblasts, expression of several oncogenes, including ha-rast24,
v-mos, and v-fes, leads to enhanced phosphorylation of histone
h3 (28). likewise, stimulation of cells with three well established tumor promoters, tpa, okadaic acid, and uvc, also
increased histone h3 phosphorylation (28 –30). recent studies
(20, 28, 31, 32) have also indicated that phosphorylation of
histone h3 is coupled to its acetylation, and such modifications
are critical for the induction of immediate-early genes in response to extracellular stimuli. to address whether arsenite
triggers histone h3 modifications, histone h3 phosphorylation
in normal human lung fibroblast wi-38 cells was examined by
immunofluorescence, using an antibody that recognizes phospho-histone h3 (ser(p)-10). compared with control cells, where

extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors and cellular stress
(18, 19). recent studies (20, 21) have indicated that growth
factors can stimulate nucleosomal histone h3 phosphorylation/
acetylation at the loci of both c-fos and c-jun through a map
kinase-dependent mechanism, thus providing an important
link between the signaling events initiated at the cell membrane and the modulation of gene transcription in the nucleus.
like growth factors, arsenite can also activate various map
kinase cascades, including those that culminate in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), c-jun
n-terminal kinase, and p38 (22). erk activation by arsenite is
primarily mediated by the  xxxg682xxx 
and the oncoprotein shc (15). in this report, we have extended
our early studies on the carcinogenic mechanisms of arsenite
and have investigated the chromatin modifications occurring at
the nucleosomes of c-fos and c-jun following arsenite stimulation. we report that arsenite induces rapid phosphorylation
and acetylation of histone h3, events that precede the induction of both c-fos and c-jun in normal human diploid fibroblasts.
by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays, we
demonstrate that the arsenite-triggered phosphoacetylation of
histone h3 on the c-fos and c-jun chromatin is primarily mediated by the erk map kinase cascade. our results support the
notion that arsenic compounds can induce chromatin remodeling leading to the altered expression of genes which, as illustrated by proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun, may contribute to
their carcinogenic effects.

c-fos and c-jun chromatin remodeling by arsenite

the level of phospho-histone h3 was low, arsenite triggered a
rapid increase of phospho-histone h3 in the nucleus. as shown
in fig. 1a, the levels of phospho-histone h3 after a 60-min
treatment with arsenite were comparable with those seen
after treatment with a combination of egf and  xxxd183xxx ,
shown previously (20) to enhance potently histone h3
phosphorylation.
egf-stimulated histone h3 phosphorylation is reportedly
restricted to a small subset of nucleosomes that are associated
with active gene transcription (20, 21, 31, 33, 34). likewise, in
drosophila salivary glands, heat shock significantly stimulates
histone h3 phosphorylation at a few loci where the heat shock
protein genes are located (35). to investigate whether arsenite
stimulates phosphorylation of histone h3 throughout the entire nucleus or only at a few loci, confocal microscopy was
performed. a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing both
phosphorylated and unphosphorylated histone h3 was used to
visualize all histone h3 proteins (fig. 1b). in unstimulated
cells, only a few loci were intensely stained by the phosphohistone h3 antibody (fig. 1b). by contrast, in cells stimulated
with egf ⫹  xxxd183xxx , phospho-histone h3 was markedly
elevated and displayed a punctate staining pattern in the nucleus (fig. 1b). as seen in the egf ⫹  xxxd183xxx  treatment

group, arsenite stimulation also resulted in a dramatic increase
in phospho-histone h3, revealing a similar punctate staining
pattern in the nucleus (fig. 1b). the marked difference between the staining patterns of phospho-histone h3 and total
histone h3 in arsenite-stimulated cells strongly suggests that
arsenite induces the phosphorylation of histone h3 at a subset
of nuclear loci (fig. 1b).
to examine further the effect of arsenite on histone h3
modification, histone proteins were extracted with  xxxd3258xxx 
from either untreated or arsenite-treated cells. histone h3
modification was examined by western blotting using antibodies specific for either phospho-histone h3 (ser(p)-10) or dually
modified histone h3 (ser(p)-10/ac-lys-14). arsenite treatment
led to increased histone h3 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. this modification was visible within 10 min after
the addition of arsenite into the medium and continued to
increase over the period studied (fig. 2a). phosphoacetyl-histone h3 increased in a time-dependent fashion with kinetics
similar to that of histone h3 phosphorylation (fig. 2a), supporting the notion that phosphorylation and acetylation of histone h3 are tightly coupled events (21). in contrast, bulk
levels of acetylated h3 did not significantly change after arsenite treatment (fig. 2a), presumably because acetylated h3 is
generally associated with actively transcribing chromatin,
whereas arsenite-regulated genes constitute only a small subset of the genome, so arsenite treatment did not greatly affect
total levels of acetylated h3, whereas tsa induced hyperacetylation of histone h3 (fig. 2a). to confirm the specificity of the
phosphoacetyl-h3 antibody on western blots, lysates from
tsa- and egf ⫹  xxxd183xxx -treated cells were included as
positive controls for both phospho-histone h3 and phosphoacetyl-h3 antibodies (fig. 2a), and only acetylation of histone h3 induced by tsa was not recognized by the anti-phosphoacetyl-h3 antibody. these results demonstrate the
presence of h3 histone that is dually modified by phosphorylation and acetylation (at ser-10 and lys-14, respectively) in
arsenite-treated cells. furthermore, to investigate whether arsenite-induced histone phosphorylation is specific for h3, a
rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing phospho-h1 (upstate
biotechnology, inc.) and a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing histone phospho- xxxg1009xxx  (phosphorylated at ser-139, upstate biotechnology, inc.) were used for western blot analysis.
 xxxd3241xxx -treated jurkat cells (0.5 ␮m, 4 h) were included as positive control of phospho- xxxg1009xxx . arsenite treatment did not have any effect on either histone h1 phosphorylation (data not shown) or histone h2a phosphorylation at
ser-139 (fig. 2a).
because arsenite is a well known activator of map kinases
erk and p38, we sought to assess whether activity of map
kinases was required for the observed histone h3 modifications. phosphoacetylation of histone h3 in arsenite-treated
cells was moderately inhibited in cells that were pretreated
with either the mek inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx  or the p38 inhibitor
 xxxd3177xxx  (fig. 2b). combination of both  xxxd3462xxx  and  xxxd3177xxx 
resulted in a more significant inhibition of histone modifications (fig. 2b). these observations suggest that arsenite-triggered map kinase activation contributes to the implementation of histone h3 modifications.
protein kinase msk1 lies downstream of p38 and erk and
can be activated by both mitogenic stimulation and stress (36).
recent studies (32) suggest that msk1 may play an important
role in mediating the phosphorylation of histone h3, thus serving as a link between the map kinase cascades and nucleosomal alterations. to examine whether msk1 could be involved
in histone h3 phosphorylation, we examined the kinetics of
msk1 activation following arsenite treatment. msk1 was im-

combined inhibitory treatment showing the greatest effect (fig.

susceptibility profiles toward the two map kinase inhibitors
support the hypothesis that msk1 plays a significant role in

c-fos and c-jun chromatin remodeling by arsenite

modulating histone h3 modification in response to arsenite.
in human diploid fibroblasts, arsenite induces c-fos and
c-jun expression through mechanisms partially dependent on
the erk pathway—to investigate whether histone h3 modification in response to arsenite may play a role in the induction
of proliferation-associated genes, we first examined the effect of
arsenite on c-fos and c-jun expression in wi-38 cells by northern blotting (fig. 3a). basal c-fos and c-jun mrna levels were
very low in unstimulated cells, and arsenite treatment potently
increased their abundance in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (fig. 3a). the kinetics of induction of mrnas encoding c-fos
and c-jun was delayed in comparison with that of histone h3
modification (compare figs. 1 and 2 with fig. 3).
the effects of arsenite on various map kinases in wi-38 cells
were examined by western blot analysis and immunocomplex
kinase assays. arsenite treatment resulted in a transient activation of the erk map kinases, as indicated by the time-dependent increase in phosphorylated erk (fig. 3b). this observation was confirmed by immunocomplex kinase assays,
showing that erk activity reached peak levels at about 10 min,
rapidly declining thereafter (fig. 3b). in contrast to the early
and transient erk activation, p38 activation was delayed, and
its activity was sustained throughout the period examined (fig.
3b). this observation was confirmed by immunocomplex kinase assays, showing that  xxxg1373xxx /3 activity was sustained throughout the period examined (fig. 3b).

(middle panel) and by immunocomplex kinase ( xxxg1373xxx /3) assays
using recombinant  xxxg1104xxx  (heat-shock protein of 25 kda) as a substrate

both inhibitors. total rna was analyzed by northern blotting. rna
loading was indicated by 18 s rrna.

induction of c-fos and c-jun, inhibitors  xxxd3462xxx  and  xxxd3177xxx 
were used, respectively.  xxxd3462xxx  completely abolished phosphorylation of the erk map kinases (fig. 4a) but had no effect on
p38 activation by arsenite (fig. 4b). interestingly,  xxxd3177xxx 
significantly augmented erk activity induced by arsenite (fig.
4a), suggesting that the p38 pathway antagonized the erk
pathway. the inhibition of the p38 pathway by  xxxd3177xxx  was
confirmed by the marked attenuation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of hsp27 (fig. 4b) and by the dramatic inhibition
of arsenite-stimulated  xxxg1373xxx /3 activity (fig. 4b).  xxxd3462xxx 
substantially inhibited c-fos and c-jun mrna induction by arsenite, reducing c-fos mrna levels by greater than 70% and
c-jun mrna levels by ⬃50% (fig. 4c). in contrast, the p38
inhibitor  xxxd3177xxx  neither inhibited c-fos expression nor affected c-jun induction by arsenite (fig. 4c). interestingly,

c-fos and c-jun chromatin remodeling by arsenite

 xxxd3177xxx  actually further enhanced arsenite-mediated induction of c-fos (fig. 4c), consistently with the observation that
 xxxd3177xxx  enhanced erk activation by arsenite (fig. 4a). the
combined effect of both  xxxd3462xxx  and  xxxd3177xxx  on c-fos and c-jun
mrna induction by arsenite was similar to that of  xxxd3462xxx  alone
(fig. 4c). taken together, these results indicate that erk
plays a prominent role in the induction of c-fos and c-jun
expression by arsenite in normal human fibroblasts.
the observation that  xxxd3177xxx  significantly augmented arsenite-induced erk activity was confirmed by immunocomplex
kinase assays using mbp as a substrate (fig. 5a), and by using
a panel of p38 inhibitors (sb202190, pd169316, and p38 inh),
which also augmented arsenite-induced erk activity (fig. 5a).
moreover, like  xxxd3177xxx , the other p38 inhibitors were also
capable of further enhancing arsenite-mediated induction of
c-fos but did not affect arsenite-mediated induction of c-jun
(fig. 5b). these observations further suggest that the p38
pathway antagonizes the erk pathway and erk-mediated
c-fos induction by arsenite in normal human fibroblasts.
transcriptional induction of c-fos and c-jun is associated
with phosphoacetylation of histone h3 at the c-fos and c-jun
chromatin sites—to examine whether arsenite stimulates histone h3 modification at the c-fos and c-jun loci, control and
arsenite-treated cells were treated with formaldehyde to crosslink chromatin and genomic dna. following solubilization
with sds and sonication, chip assays were carried out using
antibodies that specifically recognize either phospho-histone
h3 or phosphoacetyl-histone h3. genomic dna present in the
immunoprecipitates was extracted and analyzed by real time
pcr using primers specific for the amplification of the genes of
interest. real time pcr assays revealed a considerable increase in the levels of phosphorylated histone h3 on the c-fos
chromatin after arsenite treatment, reducing the ct value
(which represents the number of pcr cycles required to reach
a threshold set arbitrarily) from 33.1 to 29.4, which corresponds to a 9.8-fold increase in the amount of phospho-histone
h3 (fig. 6a). consistent with the notion that acetylation and
phosphorylation of histone h3 are tightly coupled events, arsenite treatment also resulted in a substantial increase in the
levels of phosphoacetyl-histone h3 on the c-fos chromatin, reducing ct from 32.2 to 28.7, which corresponds to a 8.6-fold
increase in the amount of phosphoacetyl-histone h3 (fig. 6a).
interestingly,  xxxd3462xxx  alone substantially inhibited both phosphorylation and phosphoacetylation of histone h3 at the c-fos
chromatin.  xxxd3177xxx  alone had no significant effect on histone
h3 modification at the c-fos locus (fig. 6a). combination of
 xxxd3177xxx  with  xxxd3462xxx  did not further reduce histone h3 modification at the c-fos locus, underscoring the notion that p38
does not play a significant role in arsenite-induced c-fos expression in these cells. the specificity of this assay was demonstrated both by the absence of c-fos amplification in the mock
immunoprecipitation samples (fig. 6, b and c, ab⫺) and by the
inability of arsenite to stimulate histone h3 modification at the
transcriptionally inactive ␤-globin locus (fig. 6, b and c).
these results support the view that arsenite promotes chromatin remodeling only at a subset of genes.
similarly, histone h3 modification at the c-jun locus was
examined. in response to arsenite treatment, the levels of phosphorylated and phosphoacetylated histone h3 on the c-jun
chromatin increased 14.9- and 6.9-fold, respectively (fig. 7a).
 xxxd3462xxx  strongly inhibited these modifications at the c-jun locus,
whereas  xxxd3177xxx  had no such effect (fig. 7a). moreover,
pre-immune serum did not bring down any c-jun chromatin, as
indicated by the absence of c-jun amplification from the mock
chip samples (fig. 7b, ab⫺). taken together, our results indicate that arsenite potently enhances histone h3 modification at

carcinogenic mechanisms of arsenic are not fully understood,
recent studies (3, 6, 9, 10, 15) strongly suggest that arsenic may
exert its carcinogenic effects by perturbing key signal trans-

kinase cascades and that arsenite-triggered erk activation is
initiated through the egf receptor and mediated by oncoproteins shc and ras (15, 22). to gain insight into downstream
mechanisms of action of this carcinogen, we have examined
arsenite-triggered signaling events at the chromatin level. we
found that arsenite treatment caused rapid phosphoacetylation

of histone h3, which preceded the induction of c-fos and c-jun.
by using pharmacological agents that selectively inhibit either
the erk or the  xxxg1368xxx  cascades, we demonstrate that
the erk pathway plays a primary role in mediating the induction of c-fos and c-jun by arsenite. through chip and quantitative real time pcr analyses, we show that arsenite treat-

with the expression of other genes likely regulated by arsenite
in a similar fashion. therefore, we propose that arsenite stimulates cell proliferation and promotes carcinogenesis, at least
in part, by modulating chromatin structure and perturbing the
expression of key proliferative genes.

ment enhances histone h3 phosphoacetylation at the loci of
both c-fos and c-jun via an erk-dependent mechanism. our
results provide a plausible mechanistic link between the arsenite-triggered activation of oncogenic events occurring at the cell
surface and the enhanced gene transcription in the nucleus. we
propose that arsenite promotes carcinogenesis, at least in part,
by causing specific alterations in chromatin structure that lead
to the increased transcription of critical proliferative genes.
the importance of the erk pathway in mediating c-fos and
c-jun induction by mitogenic stimuli is well established (18, 19,
37–39). our findings that arsenite induces the transcription of
both c-fos and c-jun through mechanisms primarily involving
the erk pathway reinforce the notion that arsenite may stimulate carcinogenesis by usurping pathways typically utilized by
growth factors. it should be pointed out that although erk is
involved in the induction of both c-fos and c-jun, it appears to be
more important for inducing c-fos expression. this is likely due
to the fact that the immediate-early induction of c-jun in the
absence of de novo protein synthesis is primarily mediated by
phosphorylation of  xxxg1222xxx  complexes composed
of c-jun and atf-2, a process that is primarily accomplished by
the c- xxxg1370xxx  pathway (18, 39, 40). our results are
consistent with the findings of huang et al. (41), who used transgenic mice carrying an ap-1-luciferase reporter construct to show
that activation of ap-1 in mouse epidermal cells by arsenite can
be blocked by the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx . interestingly, in
wi-38 cells, p38 does not play a positive role in the induction of
either c-fos or c-jun expression by arsenite (figs. 3–7), although it
does appear to play a role in the regulation of global histone h3
phosphoacetylation (fig. 2). our observations contradict previous
reports (42, 43) indicating that p38 can phosphorylate transcription factors critical for c-fos induction and is involved in c-fos
induction by  xxxd183xxx  and uv. this apparent discrepancy can
be explained by the observation that  xxxd3177xxx  augmented erk
activity stimulated by arsenite (fig. 3a). a similar augmentation
of erk activity by  xxxd3177xxx  has been reported (44) in human
neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. likewise,
 xxxd3177xxx  has been shown to potentiate the induction of c-fos and
c-jun by both egf and tpa (45). our results, along with those
reported by sheth et al. (44), suggest that p38 may have a negative effect on the erk pathway, although the exact mechanisms
involved remain unclear.
the most prominent finding in this study is that arsenite
potently stimulated histone h3 phosphoacetylation specifically
at the c-fos and c-jun chromatin (figs. 6 and 7). acetylation of
chromatin-associated histone h3 has long been linked with
increased gene transcription (46, 47). recent studies (21) indicate growth factor-mediated histone h3 acetylation is regulated by the erk pathway and is coupled to histone h3 phosphorylation. a number of oncoproteins such as h-ras, v-fes,
and v-mos, as well as several well established tumor promoters
including tpa, okadaic acid and uvc, can stimulate histone
h3 phosphorylation (28). histone h3 phosphorylation triggered by 400 ␮m arsenite is comparable with that triggered by
egf (fig. 1a). enhanced histone h3 phosphoacetylation can be
detected in cells exposed to arsenic levels as low as 2 ␮m
(although the response is not as rapid as that seen with higher
concentrations),2 a concentration that is comparable with that
measured in underground water in parts of the western united
states such as utah (48). the substantial increase in global
histone h3 phosphoacetylation is likely to have a profound
effect on the overall gene expression profile. indeed, the enhanced expression of c-fos and c-jun triggered by arsenite observed here probably only represents “the tip of the iceberg,”
