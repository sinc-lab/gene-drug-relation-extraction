background: arsenic contamination has become a major public health concern worldwide.
epidemiologic data show that long-term arsenic exposure results in the risk of skin cancer.
however, the mechanisms underlying carcinogenic effects of arsenite on skin remain to be studied.
objectives: in the present study we evaluated  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) expression, the signaling
pathways leading to cox-2 induction, and its antiapoptotic function in the response to arsenite
exposure in mouse epidermal jb6 cl41 cells.
methods: we used the luciferase reporter assay and western blots to determine cox-2 induction
by arsenite. we utilized dominant negative mutant, genetic knockout, gene knockdown, and gene
overexpression approaches to elucidate the signaling pathway involved in cox-2 induction and its
protective effect on cell apoptosis.
r esults : the induction of cox-2 by arsenite was inhibited in cl41 cells transfected with
ikkbeta-km, a dominant mutant inhibitor of kbeta (ikbeta) kinase (ikkbeta), and in ikkbeta-knockout
(ikkbeta–/–) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs). ikkbeta/nuclear factor kappab ( xxxg1559xxx ) pathway-mediated
cox-2 induction exerted an antiapoptotic effect on the cells exposed to arsenite because cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced in the cl41 cells transfected with ikkbeta-km or cox-2 small interference rna (sicox-2). in addition, ikkbeta–/– mefs stably transfected with cox-2 showed more
resistance to arsenite-induced apoptosis compared with the same control vector–transfected cells.
conclusions: these results demonstrate that arsenite exposure can induce cox-2 expression
through the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway, which thereby exerts an antiapoptotic effect in response to arsenite. in light of the importance of apoptosis evasion during carcinogenesis, we anticipate that cox-2
induction may be at least partially responsible for the carcinogenic effect of arsenite on skin.

contribute to carcinogenesis mainly by promoting cell proliferation and antagonizing cell
apoptosis (krysan et al. 2005; tsujii and
dubois 1995; wang et al. 2005).
the role of cox-2 in apoptosis resistance
and carcinogenesis suggests that cox-2 may
be involved in the regulation of apoptosis of
skin cells exposed to arsenite. therefore, in the
present study we examined the effect of arsenite
exposure on cox-2 expression in mouse epidermal jb6 cl41 cells, and we further investigated the role of cox-2 in apoptosis resistance
during arsenite exposure. the results showed
that exposure to arsenite caused significant
cox-2 expression through the inhibitor of
kappabeta (ikappabeta) kinase (ikkbeta)/nuclear factor kappab
( xxxg1559xxx ) pathway, which thereby played an
important role in antagonizing the apoptosis
induced by arsenite. these results suggest that
cox-2 induction in arsenite-exposed skin cells
may facilitate skin cancer development by conferring an apoptosis resistance and supporting
the survival of the cells with genetic alterations
that are usually eliminated by apoptosis.

materials and methods
arsenic contamination has become a major
public health concern worldwide, especially
in asia. epidemiologic data show that longterm arsenic exposure results in the risk of
various cancers [bettley and o’shea 1975;
international agency for research on cancer
(iarc) 1980; landolph 1994; nriagu 2002],
especially in the lung and skin via inhalation
and ingestion (landolph 1994). high arsenic
concentrations in drinking water (0.35–1.14
mg/l) caused increased risks of cancer of the
skin, bladder, kidney, lung, and colon
(national research council 1999). the skin
cancers associated with arsenite exposure
include bowen’s disease (carcinoma in situ),
basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (tseng et al. 1968; yu et al. 2006).
the mouse skin model of multistage carcinogenesis has demonstrated that cancer
development results from the coordination of
genetic mutation and alterations of epigenetic
factors, including the machineries regulating
cell proliferation and apoptosis (hecker
1987; zoumpourlis et al. 2003). acquiring
the capacity to evade apoptosis is a hallmark
of most cancers (hanahan and weinberg
2000). under normal circumstances, dnadamaged or mutated cells are eliminated by
apoptosis. acquired resistance to apoptosis is
a critical molecular event during carcinogenesis, and disruption of apoptosis has been
environmental health perspectives

shown to play a major role in tumor formation and malignant progression (hanahan
and weinberg 2000; hickman 2002).
whereas the induction of cell proliferation by
arsenite has been extensively studied, the
events implicated in regulating the apoptosis
of skin cells exposed to arsenite remain largely
unknown.
cyclooxygenase (cox), the rate-limiting
enzyme in the conversion of  xxxd208xxx 
to prostanoids (sheng et al. 2001; smith et al.
1996), exists as two distinct isoforms (feng
et al. 1993). cox-2 is an inducible immediate-early gene. its expression is low or nondetectable in most tissues, but it can be readily
induced in response to cell activation by
cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (feng et al. 1993; smith et al. 1996).
increasing evidence indicates that cox-2 is
related to skin cancer development. mice deficient in cox-2 develop 75% fewer tumors
than their wild type littermates when subjected to a 9,10-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/
 xxxd2925xxx  twostage chemical carcinogenesis protocol (tiano
et al. 2002). moreover, oral administration of
specific cox-2 inhibitors is effective in
reducing ultraviolet-b–induced skin carcinogenesis by up to 90% (fischer et al. 1999).
although the exact mechanisms remain to be
extensively investigated, cox-2 is thought to

after rinsing with pbs, the cells were resuspended in a solution with 0.1% triton x-100
and 0.1% sodium citrate for 5 min to increase
permeability of the cell membrane, and then
incubated with 50 µl tunel reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl

dna was visualized by flow cytometry using
the epics xl facs and expo 32 software.

results
arsenite exposure induced cox-2 expression
in cl41 cells through the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway. previous studies demonstrated that
arsenite exerts its carcinogenic effect mainly
by activating signal pathways and inducing
gene expression involved in the regulation of
cell proliferation and apoptosis (huang et al.
2004; pi et al. 2005; rossman 2003; yang
and frenkel 2002). cox-2, a key inducible
enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins,
has been related to inflammation, apoptosis,
and carcinogenesis (liu et al. 1998; tsujii
and dubois 1995; tsujii et al. 1997, 1998).
to determine whether cox-2 is also
involved in cell response to arsenite exposure,
we examined cox-2 induction by arsenite in

role of cox-2 induction via ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  in resistance to arsenite-induced apoptosis

mouse epidermal cl41 cells. as determined
by western blot analysis (figure 1a), arsenite
exposure caused a significant elevation of
cox-2 protein level. moreover, cl41 cells
exposed to arsenite for 12 hr showed a
marked induction of cox-2 transcription in
the gene reporter assay (figure 1b).
the promoter region of the cox-2 gene
contains a canonical tata box and multiple
putative transcriptional regulatory elements,
including  xxxg1559xxx , which has been indicated to
be activated in cl41 cells by arsenite exposure
(li et al. 2004). we investigated the potential
contribution of the  xxxg1559xxx  transcription factor
to cox-2 transcriptional induction by arsenite using the cox-2-luc reporter containing
full length (–1432/+59) or mutant  xxxg1559xxx 
binding sites (–223/–214) of the cox-2 gene
promoter. as shown in figure 1c, deletion of
 xxxg1559xxx  binding sites impaired arsenite-induced
cox-2 transcriptional induction. moreover,
the stable transfectants of cl41 cells harboring
ikkbeta-km, a dominant mutant of ikkbeta
(ouyang et al. 2006), and ikkbeta –/– mefs
were used to further confirm the requirement
of the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway for the induction
of cox-2 by arsenite. arsenite-induced
cox-2 expression was dramatically inhibited
in the ikkbeta-km-transfected cl41 cells, as
well as in ikkbeta –/– mefs, when compared
with control vector-transfected cl41 cells or
wild-type mefs (figure 1d, e). the basal
level of cox-2 varied at different time points,
which might be due to cell cycle progression
(figure 1d, e). collectively, these results indicate that arsenite can induce cox-2 expression at both protein and transcription levels
via an ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx –dependent pathway, suggesting that cox-2 is involved in cell
response to arsenite exposure.
cox-2 induction through the ikkbeta/
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway exerted an antiapoptotic effect
on cells exposed to arsenite. in view of the
importance of cox-2 in the regulation of cell
apoptotic response in some cells, we proposed
that the induction of cox-2 may also be
implicated in the regulation of cell apoptosis
upon arsenite exposure. based on the above
results that the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway was
required for cox-2 induction in the cells
exposed to arsenite, we examined the apoptosis
of cl41 cells transfected with ikkbeta-km after
the exposure to arsenite. the results obtained
from microscopic observation of cell morphology (figure 2a), dna content analysis by pi
staining followed by flow cytometry analysis
(figure 2b), and dna fragment detection by
tunel assay followed by flow cytometry
analysis (figure 2c) showed that the transfection of ikkbeta-km made cl41 cells much more
sensitive to apoptotic induction by arsenite.
to confirm the importance of cox-2 in
the regulation of apoptotic response after
arsenite exposure, we pretreated cl41 cells with
environmental health perspectives

ns398, an inhibitor of cox-2, and found
that it significantly sensitized the cells to arsenite-induced cell apoptosis (figure 3a, b), suggesting that cox-2 may be the mediator
responsible for the antiapoptotic effect. this
notion was further confirmed by the finding
that knockdown of endogenous cox-2
expression by its specific sirna rendered cl41
cells much more susceptible to cell apoptotic
induction by arsenite (figure 3c, d).
the role of cox-2 induction in protecting cells from apoptosis after arsenite exposure
was further verified by the finding that overexpression of cox-2 in ikkbeta–/– mefs made

(landolph 1994; nriagu 2002); skin lesions,
including skin cancers, are characteristic of

signal pathways, which thereby affects the
expression of genes involved in regulating the
machineries of the cell cycle and apoptosis
(huang et al. 2004; pi et al. 2005; rossman
2003; yang and frenkel 2002). in the present
study, we have addressed the events involved
in the regulation of apoptosis of cells exposed
to arsenite, and demonstrated that induction
of cox-2 expression through the ikkbeta/
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway plays a role in antagonizing
cell apoptosis caused by arsenite in mouse
epidermal cl41 cells.
the effect of arsenite on cox-2 expression depends on cell type and arsenite dosage.
arsenite stimulates cox-2 expression in
endothelial cells through activating ikk/ xxxg1559xxx 
and extracellular signal–regulated kinases,
respectively (trouba and germolec 2004; tsai
et al. 2002), whereas in a recent study, ding
et al. (2006) found that arsenite induces
cox-2 expression in human bronchial epithelial beas-2b cells through nfat (nuclear factor of activated t cells) rather than  xxxg1559xxx  and
 xxxg1222xxx . arsenite has been demonstrated to repress constitutive activation of
 xxxg1559xxx  and cox-2 expression in human acute
myeloid leukemia (hl-60) cells (han et al.
2005), and pretreatment of arsenite attenuates
benzo[a]pyrene cytotoxicity in a human lung
adenocarcinoma cells by decreasing  xxxg1884xxx  levels (ho and lee 2002). in the present study, we provide the first evidence that
arsenite can induce cox-2 expression through
the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway in mouse epidermal
cl41 cells.
although the detailed mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis remain largely undefined,
it is generally accepted that apoptosis evasion
is one of the hallmarks during cancer development (hanahan and weinberg 2000).
apoptosis plays a major role in developmental
biology, cellular population dynamics, and
disease states. apoptosis typically occurs when
cellular genetic damage exceeds the repair
capacity. the suppression of apoptosis, in the
face of significant genetic damage, could facilitate accumulation of aberrant cells and may be
a critical step in the pathogenesis of malignancy (abrams 2002; johnstone et al. 2002;
zornig et al. 2001). as a sensor of cellular
stress, p53 is a critical initiator of the apoptotic pathway (lowe and lin 2000). p53 protein accumulates in cells under stress, which
thereby promotes apoptosis mainly by activating the expression of proapoptotic bcl-2 family members (e.g., bax, bak, puma,  xxxg1783xxx )
and repressing antiapoptotic bcl-2 (b-cell
leukemia) proteins (bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx ) and
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (survivin)
(bartke et al. 2001; hoffman et al. 2002;
ryan et al. 2001; wu et al. 2001). the elimination of these damaged cells through apoptosis maintains genomic stability and prevents
tumorigenesis. because p53 mediates cell

516

cox-2 in the regulation of cell apoptosis, the
mechanisms are not well-defined. nonetheless,
there is evidence supporting that cox-2 may
interfere with p53-mediated cell apoptosis
(han et al. 2002) and regulate mitochondrialtriggered cell apoptosis (sun et al. 2002).
although the exact mechanisms require further

apoptosis and growth arrest, p53 mutation is
responsible for > 50% of cancer development
in humans. in the present study, we demonstrated that cox-2 plays an important role in
antagonizing cell apoptosis induced by arsenite
in mouse epidermal cells. although a large
body of evidence indicates the importance of

role of cox-2 induction via ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  in resistance to arsenite-induced apoptosis

investigation, the antiapoptotic effect of
cox-2 observed in the present study may
provide more strategies with cox-2 as the
target for skin cancer prevention and skin cancer therapy, especially in those countries with
high arsenite contamination in drinking water.
it is notable that the contributions of the
ikks/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway to carcinogen- induced
skin cancer remain controversial. ikkalpha has
been demonstrated to be an inhibitory factor
for the proliferation of skin epidermis (hu
et al. 1999, 2001; li et al. 1999) and overexpression of active p50 and p65  xxxg1559xxx  subunits in transgenic epithelium-produced
hypoplasia and growth inhibition (seitz et al.
1998). however, it has been reported that
the deletion of ikkbeta does not affect the
proliferation of skin epidermis (pasparakis
et al. 2002);  xxxg1561xxx  deficiency results in a

sustained  xxxg1559xxx  response and severe widespread dermatitis characterized by epidermal
hyperplasia in mice (klement et al. 1996).
budunova et al. (1999) demonstrated that
epidermal inflammation and hyperplasia play
a critical role in skin tumor promotion, and
 xxxg1559xxx  is one of the well-known mediators of
these effects. substances such as  xxxd2925xxx 
and okadaic acid, which are promoters of skin
cancer, are also strong inducers of the  xxxg1559xxx 
response in keratinocytes (budunova et al.
1999). in the present study, we demonstrated
that the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway is required for
cox-2 induction by arsenite, suggesting that
the ikkbeta/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway may contribute to
arsenite-induced carcinogenesis by protecting
cells from apoptosis through inducing
cox-2 expression. interestingly, we also
found that apoptosis of ikkbeta –/– mefs

(a) ikkbeta–/–(vector) and ikkbeta–/–(cox-2) cells were extracted with sds-sample buffer, and the cell extracts
were analyzed by western blot with antibodies against cox-2 or  xxxg861xxx . (b, c) ikkbeta–/–(vector) and
ikkbeta–/–(cox-2) were treated with 20 µm arsenite for 36 hr and photographed under microscopy (b);

induced by arsenite is affected largely by cell
density. high density of ikkbeta–/– mefs shows
much lower susceptibility to arsenite-induced
apoptosis (song et al. 2006). the mechanisms
are now under investigation in our laboratory.
in summary, we have demonstrated that
exposure of the cells to arsenite causes a significant cox-2 expression in an ikkbeta/
 xxxg1559xxx –dependent manner, which thereby
plays an important role in antagonizing apoptosis induced by arsenite. these results suggest that arsenite, as a carcinogen, may
facilitate skin cancer development by supporting the survival of the cells with genetic alterations, which is usually eliminated by
apoptosis. thus, inhibition of cox-2 may be
a promising approach for skin cancer prevention in those countries with severe arsenite
pollution in drinking water.
