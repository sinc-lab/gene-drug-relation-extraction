tyrosine residue in the central dna binding and religation
domain.(9 –12) more recently, a third cluster of mutations and
deletions has been described in the cooh-terminal region of
the enzyme, all of which result in the aberrant localization of
 xxxg2312xxx  alpha in the cytoplasm.(13 –25) the presence of a cytoplasmic enzyme provides a plausible explanation for the
resistance of  xxxg2312xxx  poisons, as it would result in the formation of fewer  xxxg2312xxx /dna complexes that could be stabilized
by  xxxg2312xxx -targeting drugs and, hence, reduce drug sensibility.
the first description of  xxxg2312xxx  poison resistance and topo
ii alpha cytoplasmic localization was found in the small-cell
lung cancer (sclc) cell line h69 / vp with resistance to
etoposide,(13,14) and later to several other  xxxg2312xxx  poison-resistant
cell lines representative from different tissues.(15–25) in all
these cell lines, deletions in the  xxxg2311xxx  gene around the
nucleotide 4267 conduce to an alternative splicing that is
translated into a truncated 160 kda  xxxg2312xxx  alpha with cytoplasmic localization. a remarkable finding of these studies is
that the truncation affected at least one of the two bipartite
nuclear localization signals (nls) present in the coohterminal region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha.(26) in these cells,  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha retains most of its catalytic activity intact, but a significant reduction in the nuclear enzyme concentration has been
used to explain the increase in  xxxg2312xxx  poison resistance.
in the present report, we characterized a non-small-cell lung
cancer (nsclc) cell line with innate resistance to etoposide.
this resistance could be associated with the expression of
 xxxg2312xxx  alpha mainly in the cytoplasmic region. iner-37
cells transcribe two  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrnas: 4.8 kb and 2.0 kb.
the large transcript appears to be translated into a truncated
protein product of 160 kda, where the more proximal
cooh-terminal nls1454 −1497 has been lost. these cells could
provide a valuable in vitro model to study the importance of
 xxxg2312xxx  alpha in the acquisition of atypical multidrug resistance as well as its role in tumoral progression.

topoisomerase (topo) ii alpha is a target for many chemotherapeutic agents in clinical use. in tumor cells resistant to  xxxg2312xxx  poisons,
there have been descriptions of quantitative and qualitative
alterations involved in this enzyme. more recently, the cytoplasmic
localization of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha has been described as a mechanism
to confer drug resistance. here, we report the characterization of
a human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line, iner-37, which
shows an innate resistance to etoposide. in this cell line,
etoposide resistance was directly associated with the expression
of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha resident mainly in the cytoplasmic region. at
the molecular level, iner-37 cells carry on a heterozygous gene
deletion, transcribing two different  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrnas: 4.8 kb
and 2.0 kb. the bigger 4.8 kb mrna (missing 1.3 kb of 3′′ mrna
and including the untranslated region) is translated into a
truncated cytoplasmic protein of approximately 160 kda. the
protein truncation affects at least 96 amino acids in the coohterminal region where the more proximal bipartite nuclear
localization signal is located. the iner-37 cell line is the first
cancer cell line reported with an innate mutation affecting the 3′′end region of the  xxxg2312xxx  alpha gene that confers a cytoplasmic
localization of the enzyme and therefore an increased resistance
to etoposide. (cancer sci 2005; 96: 774–783)

d

na topoisomerase (topo) ii alpha is a nuclear enzyme
of 170 kda that catalyzes the decatenation and the
unknotting of topologically linked dna circles and the
relaxation of supercoiled dna.(1) this enzyme is essential for
the viability of cells because it is involved in chromosome
segregation and is the major component of the nuclear matrix
and mitotic and meiotic chromosomes.(2)  xxxg2312xxx  alpha is a
major target for a variety of antineoplastic agents. epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide [vp16] ),  xxxd3309xxx  ( xxxd3309xxx ), aminocridines ( xxxd168xxx ), anthracyclines, anthracenediones,
doxorubicin,  xxxd1816xxx , mitoxantrone and  xxxd1800xxx ,
are examples of such agents and are collectively referred to
as  xxxg2312xxx  poisons. (3) these agents allow  xxxg2312xxx  to cleave
dna, and slow the religation steps catalyzed by the enzyme.
as a consequence, covalent  xxxg2312xxx  breaks accumulate in the
cell and produce cell death.(4)
resistance to  xxxg2312xxx -targeting drugs in drug-selected cell
lines has been associated with reduced expression of the topo
ii alpha enzyme. in addition, a number of point mutations or
deletions in  xxxg2312xxx  alpha have been described in resistant cell
lines. these mutations tend to be clustered in either the nh 2proximal atp-binding domain(5– 8) or near to the active site of

materials and methods
chemicals
etoposide ( xxxd2068xxx ) and  xxxd3309xxx  ( xxxd3309xxx ) were purchased
from bristol-meyers squibb (park avenue, ny, usa), doxorubicin was from columbia laboratories (livingston, nj,
usa), and  xxxd412xxx , atp, triton x-100 and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (pmsf) were purchased from sigma
chemical (st louis, mo, usa). the drugs were dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) as a stock (1 mm) and diluted to
the required concentrations in tissue culture medium.
cell culture
the human lung cancer cell line named iner-37 was
obtained from a pleural effusion of an untreated patient with
a diagnosis of nsclc. under cytological examination the
iner-37 cell line was identified as lung adenocarcinoma. in
vitro, iner-37 cells grew forming a well-defined monolayer
with a doubling time of 30 h (1.2 days). other human
nsclc cell lines used in this study were the iner-51 cells
and their clones vp-1 and psc-1, all of which were obtained in
our laboratory from a pleural effusion of a lung cancer patient.
the vp-1 cells are a mutant clone obtained by stepwise
exposition to increasing concentrations of etoposide, whereas
the psc-1 cells were selected with doxorubicin and sdz
 xxxd3488xxx  until obtaining a mutant clone nonexpressing p-gp.
the a427 cells (nsclc) and hela cells (cervical carcinoma)
were obtained from the attc reservoir. all the lung cancer
cell lines were grown in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids,
1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units / ml of
penicillin, 100 µg / ml of streptomycin. hela cells were
grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs. all cell lines
were grown in monolayer cultures at 37°c in a 5% co 2
humidified atmosphere.
cytotoxic assay and ic50 determination
the index of drug cytotoxicity (ic50) was determined by the
use of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (mtt) assay.(27) briefly, 7 × 103 cells/ well were
plated in a 96-well plate (corning incorporated life sciences,
acton, ma, usa) and drugs were added at different concentrations per well. after 72 h, the culture medium was retired
and mtt reagent dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) was added to reach a final concentration of 2 mg/ml.
after 4 h of incubation, the cells were washed carefully with
pbs and the crystals were dissolved by the addition of 100%
dmso for 20 min with occasional shaking. finally, absorbance,
at 540 nm, was measured using an automated microplate reader
(labsystem multiskan, helsinki, finland). in each experiment,
the drug determination was analyzed in six individual wells. cell
survival was estimated as a percentage of the corresponding
control. drug cytotoxicity was assayed by ic50, corresponding
to a 50% decrease in cell survival rate respective to non-drug
treated cultures.
preparation of nuclear extracts
nuclear extracts, for assays of enzyme activity, were
prepared from exponentially growing cells as described
previously.(28) briefly, 1–2 × 106 of iner-37 and hela cells
bautista de lucio and barrera-rodríguez

was pelleted at 800 g, followed by washing with pbs. the pellet
was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer a [50 mm nacl, 1 mm
kh2po4 (ph 6.8), 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm egta, 0.2 mm
dithiothreitol (dtt), 1 mm pmsf] and 9 ml of buffer b (buffer
a with 0.3% triton x-100) then incubated on ice for 10 min.
the pellet was washed with buffer a and nuclei were pelleted
at 1500 g. nuclei were resuspended in 500 µl of buffer a
and 500 µl of buffer c [50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 1 mm edta,
1 m nacl, 0.1 mm dtt, 1 mm pmsf] and the nuclei were
incubated on ice for 90 min and then were centrifuged at
15 000 g and resuspended in 50 µl of buffer a and 50 µl of
buffer b, and an equal volume of 87% glycerol. the protein
concentration was determined by the lowry–follin method.
phi-174 dna unknotting assay
catalytic activity was measured by unknotting of the phi-174
dna phage.(15) a total assay volume of 25 µl contained the
unknotting buffer [50 mm tris (ph 7.5), 85 mm kcl, 10 mm
mgcl2, 0.5 mm dtt, 0.5 mm edta, 30 µg / ml bovine
 xxxg124xxx , 1 mm atp], nuclear extract and 0.5 µg of the
phi-174 knotted dna. after incubation at 37°c for 30 min,
the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2.5 µl of 10%
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds) and 2.5 µl proteinase k (1 µg /µl;
sigma, st louis, mo, usa). samples were loaded on 1%
agarose gels and electrophoresed in tris-buffered edta,
then stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under
uv illumination using a polaroid camera (ds34; polaroid, santa
ana, ca, usa).
immunocytochemical staining
cell lines were grown on glass microscope slides in the
presence of the culture medium. immunostaining for  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha was performed with indirect immunoperoxidases using
a rabbit anti- xxxg2312xxx  alpha antibody (kindly provided by dr
leroy f. liu) at a dilution of 1:100. detection of primary
antibody was done with a detection system kit (vectastain,
elite abc kit, vector, # cat. pk6101; burlingame, ca, usa)
using a secondary goat anti-rabbit igg (h+l) linked to biotin
followed by incubation with streptavidin linked to horseradish
peroxidase. color development was accomplished with dab
substrate. slides were photographed with an optic microscope
(axioskop; carl zeiss, df, mexico) and the images were
digitalized using imagepro-plus software, version 4.0 (media
cybernetics, silver spring, md, usa).
preparation of cell extracts for western blot analysis
iner-37 and hela cells (1–2 × 106) were pelleted at 800 g and
washed with pbs. the pellet was resuspended in buffer d
[100 mm nacl, 50 mm kcl, 0.1 mm edta, 20 mm trishcl (ph 7.5), 0.1 mm pmsf, 10% glycerol, 0.1% nonidet
p-40, 0.1% triton x-100], and a protease inhibitor cocktail
containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulphonyl fluoride,
aprotinin, leupeptin,  xxxd3463xxx , peptatin a and e-64 (sigma).
samples were frozen and lyzed in liquid n2. sixty micrograms of total protein were electrophoresed (60 µg protein/
lane) in 7.5% sds-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred
onto nitrocellulose paper. the nitrocellulose strips were
incubated in a blocking buffer (3% non-fat dry milk, 0.02%
sodium azide in pbs containing 0.02% tween 20) for 60 min
at room temperature. transferred proteins were reacted with
cancer sci | november 2005 | vol. 96 | no. 11 | 775

two different goat polyclonal anti- xxxg2312xxx  alpha antibodies:
(a) recognizing an epitope mapping within an internal region
(s-20; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa, cal.
# cat. sc-5348); and (b) recognizing an epitope mapping
near the carboxyl terminus (k-19, santa cruz biotechnology,
cal. # cat. sc-5347). both antibodies were worked with
1:100 dilution (in pbs containing 0.02% tween-20 and 0.02%
sodium azide) overnight at 4°c. also, a polyclonal antibody
recognizing the last 16 residues of the cooh-terminal region
of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha (topogen, columbus, oh, usa, # cat 2011–1)
worked with a 1:1000 dilution. the reactivity of the primary
antibodies was visualized by incubation with a biotinylated
swine anti-goat-mouse-rabbit ig (multilink; dako, carpinteria,
ca, usa, # cat. e0453), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl western blotting detection system; amersham
biosciences, buckinghamshire, uk). mouse monoclonal
antibody anti-actin (zymed, san francisco, ca, usa, # cat.
03–3100) was used as control.
in vitro reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) assay
total rna was extracted from the cell lines with trizol reagent
(invitrogen, life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. single stranded cdna was
synthesized by reverse transcription from 5 µg of total rna
using superscript ii rnase h– reverse transcriptase and oligodt16−18 (invitrogen). the amplification was performed in a final
volume of 25 µl, containing 0.5 µl cdna, 50 pm of each
oligonucleotide primer, 30 µm of each dntps, 2.5 units of taq
dna polymerase, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 20 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.4)
and 50 mm kcl. amplification was carried out in a thermal
cycler (programmed thermal controller, model ptc-100; mj
research, watertown, ma, usa) for 35 cycles of denaturalization at 94°c for 1 min, annealing at 55–60°c for 2 min,
and polymerization at 72°c for 3 min. the sequences of
sense (s) and antisense (as) primers used were:  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
s: 5′-ctgaaggaagccctcaagaag-3′ (3728–3748 nt), as: 5′ggtcttaggtggactagcatc-3′ (4051–4071 nt); multidrug-resistance
related protein 1 (mrp1), s: 5′-tctctcccgacatgaccgagg-3′ (793 –
818 nt), as: 5′-ccaggaatatgatgccccgacttc-3′ (1063–1088 nt);
multidrug-resistance 1 (mdr-1), s: 5′-cccatcattgcaatagcagg-3′
(2596 –2615 nt), as: 5′-gttcaaacttctgctcctga-3′ (2733 –2752 nt);
glutathione s transferase (gst)-m1, s: 5′-gaactccctgaaaagctaaag3′ (442– 462 nt), as: 5′-gttgggctcaaatatacggtgg-3′ (551–573 nt);
glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ), s:
5′-tggggaaggtgaaggtcgga-3′ (40–59 nt), as: 5′gaaggggtcattgatggcaa-3′ (130–149 nt). three other pairs of
oligonucleotides were also used to analyze the  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha-3′-end region,(9) each one of them were identified
according to their position in the cdna sequence as
follows: fi (3021–3570 nt), fii (3519–4162 nt) and fiii
(4124–4771 nt). the pcr products were gel electrophoresed
and photographed.
northern blot analysis
ten micrograms/ line of total rna were separated on 1%
agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and blotted
onto hybond-n+ membrane (amersham biosciences) by
capillary transfer. for detection of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha, blots were
hybridized with a 293 nt cdna probe, obtained by rt-pcr
776

from hela cells, span 1246 –1539 nt, and labeled with [32palpha-ctp] using the random primers dna labeling system
(invitrogen). rna loading on gels was verified by comparing
28s and 18s rna stained with ethidium bromide. membranes
were exposed to kodak x-omat ar film (eastman kodak,
rochester, ny, usa) at −70°c.
3′′ race assay
rapid amplification of 3′-ends of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha cdna were
assayed using the system for rapid amplification of cdna ends
(3′-race) kit (invitrogen). briefly, first-strand cdnas were
synthesized from 5 µg of total rna using a 3′-race-rt
adapter primer 5′-aaggatccgtcgacatcgataatacgactcactataaggg
atttttttttttttttt-3′. first-round amplifications were generated
with the  xxxg2312xxx  alpha s primer 5′-ctgaaggaagccctcaagaag3′ (beginning at nt 3857) and as adapter primer 5′gacatcgataatacgac-3′, corresponding to the underlined region
in the 3′-race-rt adapter primer. each reaction mixture
contained 20 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.4), 2 mm mgcl2, 50 mm
kcl, 200 µm dntps, 0.1 units of taq dna polymerase and
200 nm each of the appropriate primers, developed in a final
volume of 25 µl. the pcr profile was as follows: one cycle
at 94°c for 1 min, 50°c for 1 min and 72°c for 4 min; and 35
cycles at 94°c for 1 min, 50°c for 1 min and 72°c for 3 min.

results
cytotoxicity assays
cytotoxicity assays using different drugs involved in the
multidrug resistant phenotype showed that iner-37 cells
displayed a higher resistance to etoposide compared to the
other three human lung cancer cell lines. the calculated value
of ic50 to etoposide was 92.9 µm, being 34.4-fold higher when
compared to iner-51 cells (2.7 µm), and 24- to 25-fold higher
when compared to psc-1 and a427 cell lines (3.8 and 3.7 µm,
respectively). in agreement with the higher etoposide resistance,
the ic50 values of iner-37 cells were similar to those displayed
by the etoposide-resistant cell line vp-1 (70.9 µm) (table 1).
a similar pattern of resistance was founded when iner-37
cells were treated with  xxxd3309xxx . for other anticancer drugs,
like doxorubicin, iner-37 displayed a more sensitive phenotype
(2.1 µm) than iner-51, vp-1 and psc-1 (4.4 µm, 71 µm
and 9.2 µm, respectively). a relative resistance was found to
 xxxd412xxx , but these cells were sensitive to cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracyl or methotrexate (data not shown).
analysis of mdr-related genes by rt-pcr
tumor cell lines with the etoposide-resistance phenotype often
show alterations in the nuclear enzyme  xxxg2312xxx  alpha, so we
decided to analyze the expression levels of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha as well
as other genes related to the acquisition of the drug-resistance
phenotype. rt-pcr amplification of cdna from iner-37 cells
using a pair of specific primers for  xxxg2312xxx  alpha gene (3728–
4051 nt) showed an amplification band of 343 bp corresponding to the anticipated fragment size and identical to the amplicon
obtained from cdna of hela cells (fig. 1a). no differences
in the intensity of bands were noted. further rt-pcr analysis
of other mdr-related genes identified that iner-37 cells
properly expressed  xxxg399xxx  and gst-m1 but no amplification
was seen for the mdr-1 transcript (fig. 1b).

range of nuclear protein concentrations, maintaining 80% of
the substrate unaltered at the maximal concentration of 6 µg
(fig. 2a). these results showed that iner-37 nuclei displayed
a decrease in the nuclear activity of topo type ii (4-fold), and
suggested a reduction in nuclear enzyme concentration or a
protein alteration affecting its catalytic activity, which could
be accountable for the etoposide resistance.
to obtain more information about enzyme alterations,
whole-cell extracts were also assayed. surprisingly, the
measurements of  xxxg2312xxx  activity in whole-cell extracts from
iner-37 cells showed comparable levels of enzymatic activity in the whole-cell extracts from hela cells, demonstrating
no alteration in  xxxg2312xxx  catalytic activity, but showing evidence of altered subcellular  xxxg2312xxx  localization (fig. 2b). in
all of these experiments, the  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor etoposide was
able to inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme equally in
hela cells and in iner-37 cells (data not shown).

micrograms of total rna were used to synthesized cdna and the

hela cells as a control and iner-37 cells. (b) multidrug-resistance
related protein 1 ( xxxg399xxx ), glutathione s transferase (gst)-m1 and

used as a positive control of expression of gst-m1, mrp1 and  xxxg10xxx , respectively. the expression of the glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) gene was used as a constitutive control for
the integrity of the rna molecules.

catalytic activity of  xxxg2312xxx 
a frequent alteration described in etoposide-resistant cell
lines is a reduction in the catalytic activity of the target
enzyme  xxxg2312xxx , so we decided to isolate nuclei from iner37 cells and the protein nuclear extracts were assayed by
its capacity to unknot the dna phage phi-174. due to the
difficulty of not having a suitable nuclear extract to be used
as a reference of enzymatic activity, we decided to use nuclei
from hela, as a lot is known about  xxxg2312xxx  in these cells. the
results displayed an almost linear unknotting activity of the
dna-phage, over a concentration range of 1– 6 µg when
nuclear protein extract from hela was used. however,
when nuclear proteins of the iner-37 cells were assayed, a
reduction in the activity was evident throughout the full

subcellular localization of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
several cancer cell lines have been described with altered
subcellular localization of topoisomerases, but a common
feature of all of them is the presence of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha in the
cytoplasmic region. to establish whether iner-37 cells display
the cytoplasmic phenotype, the iner-37 tumor cell line was
reacted with specific polyclonal antibodies recognizing topo
ii alpha (kindly provided by dr lf liu). figure 3 shows a
representative immunocytochemical analysis of iner-37
cells where the positivity of the antibody is mainly located in
the cytoplasmic region (fig. 3b – d). in contrast, hela cells
showed a fully nuclear staining (fig. 3a) these results
showed unequivocally that iner-37 cells express topo
ii alpha in the cytoplasmic region. thus, as it has been
described for other etoposide-resistant cell lines, etoposide
resistance of iner-37 cells may be associated with the
cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme.
analysis of the 3′′ region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna
a common feature in cytoplasmic  xxxg2312xxx  alpha cancer cell
lines is the occurrence of deletions or mutations in the 3′-end
region of the  xxxg2311xxx  alpha gene, which are reflected in the
size of the transcript as well as in the protein product.
therefore, rt-pcr analysis was performed over the 3′-end
region of the  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna, using three pairs of
oligonucleotides that spanned approximately the last 2 kb
(fig. 4a). no difference in the presence of amplicon sizes
between hela and iner-37 cells was seen when fragment i
(fi, 3021–3570 nt) and fragment ii (fii, 3519 – 4162 nt) were
analyzed. however, when fragment iii (fiii, 4124 – 4771 nt)

was amplified, no amplification band could be obtained,
strongly suggesting an alteration or deletion in the sequence
(fig. 4b).
with the aim of obtaining more evidence of alterations in
the 3′-end region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna, a rapid amplification of the 3′-end region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha cdna was assayed.
to perform the rt-pcr amplification, a 3′-primer located at
the 3857 nt (upstream of the as primer of fii), and as
matching 17 nt of the 3′-race adapter primer were used to
synthesize the cdna. the 3857– 4590 nt amplified fragment
contained part of the coding sequences together with the last
995 nt of the non-coding sequence of the 3′-untranslated
region (utr). the 3′race amplification of cdna obtained
from hela cells amplified a product of approximately
1800 bp. in iner-37 cells the cdna amplification showed a
smaller size product of 650 bp, revealing the loss of a large
cdna fragment. (fig. 4c).
total rna was also analyzed by northern blot using a
pcr-cdna probe of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha (1246– 1539 nt; atp
probe). two truncated mrnas species of 4.8 kb and 2.0 kb
in roughly equivalent amounts were obtained, each one of

them being shorter than the normal size of 6.1 – 6.3 kb predicted and found in hela cells (fig. 4d).
in summary, all these results showed that iner-37 cells
carry on a deletion in the 3′-end region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
mrna of approximately 1300 bp, which involved the coding
region as well as part of the 3′-utr. as the rt-pcr amplification with fii using a pair of oligonucleotides matched
within the nucleotides 3519–4162, we can localize the mrna
deletion downstream of 4162 nt, just near where other mrna
deletions have been found in other cell lines (fig. 5).
relative molecular mass 160 000 truncated  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
protein
because two mrna species (4.8 kb and 2.0 kb) are expressed
in iner-37 cells, we predicted that the larger size transcript
could be transcribed to become a protein product of approximately 1435 amino acids that migrates to give a coohterminal truncated protein of 160 kda. for the smaller
2.0 kb mrna, a protein product of 600 amino acids with a
molecular weight of 65 460 da, could be expected. three

fig. 6. western blot analysis of whole
extracts from iner-37 and hela cells. sixty
micrograms of cell extract protein from iner37 and hela cells were subjected to sodium
dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
and probed with the following antibodies:
two goat polyclonal anti-topoisomerase
(topo) ii alpha antibodies raised against an
internal epitope or recognizing an epitope
mapping near the carboxyl terminus were
worked at 1:100 dilution; a polyclonal
antibody that recognizes the last 16 residues
of the cooh-terminal region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
was used at 1:1000 dilution. to visualize the
reactivity of the antibodies, a biotinylated
swine anti-goat-mouse-rabbit igg, followed
by enhanced chemiluminescence were used.
actin was used as the reference control.

in the enzyme were used. while using an antibody
recognizing an epitope within the internal region of  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha (s-20; santa cruz biotechnology), it was possible to
identify a protein of approximately 160 kda, smaller than the
wild-type size product observed in hela cells (170 kda)
(fig. 6). no other bands were identified by this antibody. to
corroborate the cooh-terminal truncation, another antibody
which recognizes an epitope mapping near to the coohterminal region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha (k-19; santa cruz
biotechnology) was also employed. in this case, the antibody
was unable to identify the cooh-terminal truncated enzyme.
similar results were obtained when an anti- xxxg2312xxx  alpha
antibody capable of recognizing the last 16 amino acids in
the cooh-terminal region (topogen, colombus, oh, usa)
was used. thus, the protein analysis showed that iner-37
cells express a truncated protein of 160 kda, which have lost
at least 96 amino acids in the cooh-terminal region. as the
more proximal nls1454−1497 is localized in this region, our
data is in agreement with the presence of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha in the
cytoplasmic region.

discussion
cancer cells can develop resistance to  xxxg2312xxx  alpha inhibitors
by overexpressing drug efflux pumps like p-gp or mrps(29) or
by altering the amount or the form of the target enzyme
bautista de lucio and barrera-rodríguez

itself.  xxxg2312xxx  resistance also correlated with a decrement in
 xxxg2312xxx  alpha levels or with mutations in the protein that
reduce enzymatic activity.(30) additionally, the presence of
cytoplasmic  xxxg2312xxx  alpha has been mentioned as a plausible
explanation for the resistance of cells to  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
inhibitors.(13,15,19,22,23) in cancer cells, the mechanisms that
contribute to a cytoplasmic  xxxg2312xxx  alpha phenotype are
unclear. however, to date, seven human cancer cell lines
showing  xxxg2312xxx  alpha resident in the cytoplasmic region have
been described. these include three sclc cell lines (h209/
v6, h209/ vp and h69/ vp), two breast cancer cell lines
(t47d/ vp and mcf-7/ vp) and two of leukemic t-cell
lineage (hl60/ mx2 and cem). in all of these cells, the
 xxxg2311xxx  gene has been affected through various mechanisms,
including exonic extension through a splice site, alternative
splicing, insertions or deletions, which result in large
deletions in the cooh-terminal region of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha, and
consequently, the loss of a functional nls resident in this
region.(13 –25) this report describes the characterization of the
human nsclc line named iner-37, which shows an innate
resistance to etoposide. in this cell line, etoposide resistance
was directly associated with the expression of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha,
resident mainly in the cytoplasmic region. a more in-depth
analysis showed that iner-37 cells carry on a heterozygous
gene deletion, transcribing two sizes of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha
mrnas: 4.8 kb and 2.0 kb. the 4.8 kb major size mrna
cancer sci | november 2005 | vol. 96 | no. 11 | 781

(missing 1.3 kb and including the 3′-utr) is translated to a
truncated cytoplasmic protein of approximately 160 kda.
one of the major difficulties in describing drug resistance
in cancer cells is to acquire a point of reference to assign the
level of resistance. in several works, drug resistance is accurately determined because most of the cells tested had a wildtype drug-sensitive parental cell to compare with. to overcome this inconvenience in this work, iner-37 cells were
compared with a battery of lung cancer cell lines, one of them
an etoposide-resistant cell (vp-1). iner-37 cells showed an
increased resistance to epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide and
 xxxd3309xxx ), but no cross-resistance was found to doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, 5-flourouracyl or methotrexate. this pattern of resistance was in agreement with the lack of expression of mdr-1/ p-gp. transcripts for  xxxg399xxx  and gst-m1
were also expressed by iner-37 cells; however, no experiment was conduced to evaluate these systems, so we cannot
discard these mechanisms with etoposide resistance.
the cytoplasmic localization of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha is indicated
by mutations affecting the 3′-end region of the  xxxg2311xxx  gene
where two bipartite nls have been described (nls1259−1296
and nls1454 −1497), and disturbance of at least one of them
decreases the amount of enzyme translocated to the nucleus.(26)
to explain the presence of mutations in this region, mirski
et al. suggested the presence of a ‘hot spot’ into intron 33.(22)
alu sequences are present at this site, increasing the number
of recombination events in this region. thus, to date, almost
all the cancer cells lines with cytoplasmic  xxxg2312xxx  alpha show
alterations or deletions in this region, with the expression of
a truncated enzyme of 160 kda, where the final 109 amino
acids of the cooh-terminal region have been lost. in this
work, we found that iner-37 cells also express a truncated
protein (160 kda), where at least 96 amino acids of the
cooh-terminal region appears to be lost. the similarities
between our cell line and all of the others reported permit us
to assume that the cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme
obeys the lack of the more proximal nls1454 −1497.
of the cancer cell lines where the 3′-end region of  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha mrna is affected, iner-37 cells are most similar to
hl60/ mx2 cells, because both cell lines encompass a 1.3 kb
deletion, affecting the 3′-coding and 3′-utr expressing a
4.4 – 4.8 kb mrna. hl60/mx2 cells originate a deleted transcript using an altered mrna processing mechanism.(19,20)
unfortunately, we do not yet know if a similar mechanism
occurs in iner-37 cells, and as a consequence, this will be
an issue of future investigations. the iner-37 cells also
express a 2.0 kb  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna. for this transcript we
do not know the boundaries of the deletion. however, if this
small mrna is traduced, a truncated-protein product of
65 kda would be expected. this truncated protein would not
be immunologically detectable by the antibodies used in the
present study. nevertheless, it has been reported that truncation of 366 residues of the cooh-terminal led to full loss of
catalytic activity,(31) whereas the expression of the nh 2terminal fragments of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha are rapidly degraded.(32)
consequently, if the smaller 2.0 kb mrna is traduced, it will
produce a non-functional enzyme or an unstable protein.
it is well known that  xxxg2312xxx  alpha is a highly abundant
chromatin-associated protein and presumably the major
form regulating mitotic chromosome events.(33) in cancer
782

cells which express  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mostly outside the nucleus,
it has been mentioned that mitosis appeared to be entirely
sustained by cytosolic  xxxg2312xxx  alpha, which probably entered
the chromatin after breakdown of the nuclear envelope.
nevertheless, not all nuclear functions seem to be efficiently
compensate, for example, in h69/ vp cells, the karyotype is
highly polyploid, indicating that the cytoplasmic localization
of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha increases the rate of non-disjunction
events.(34) likewise, we found that iner-37 cells also
showed polyploidy with numerous acrocentric chromosomes
(data not shown). thus, the importance of maintaining topo
ii alpha in the nucleus, at least for chromosome condensation
and chromosome segregation, is evident.
an interesting observation is that all the cancer cell lines
with 3′-end mutations in the  xxxg2311xxx  gene were obtained by
stepwise selection to  xxxg2312xxx  poisons, with the unique exception of cem cells. this cell line, derived from a patient with
acute leukemia, shows a higher sensitivity to  xxxg2312xxx  poisons.(35) in our case, the iner-37 cells are the first evidence
in one human cell line where the spontaneous mutation
affecting the 3′-end region of the  xxxg2311xxx  gene results in the
acquisition of resistance to  xxxg2312xxx  poisons. whether the 3′end mutations account for drug resistance in vivo is not
known; however, it was published recently that cytoplasmic
localization of  xxxg2312xxx  alpha impacts on chemotherapeutic
treatment and clinical outcome in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.(36)
it is well known that  xxxg2312xxx  alpha is a multifunctional
enzyme involved in many cellular functions, including the g2
cell cycle checkpoint pathway. during the cell cycle,  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha mrna increases 15- to 16-fold during the late s phase,
peaks in g2/ m and rapidly decreases following mitosis.
in hela cells, these variations in  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna are
associated with significant changes in mrna stability.
recent evidence shows that  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna stability is
regulated by the interaction of the 3′-utr with redoxsensitive protein complexes.(37) therefore, deletions involving3′-utr mrna could confer a constitutive mrna expression
and alteration in the cell cycle. because iner-37 cells have
shown a  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna deletion (involving the 3′utr), it will be interesting to determine if a deregulated
stability of the  xxxg2312xxx  alpha mrna exists in these cells.
finally, an important consideration exists. because  xxxg2312xxx 
alpha has a vital role in cell function and evidence shows a
close interaction between  xxxg2312xxx  alpha and two important
cell cycle regulators (p53 and rb), it would be interesting to
ask if 3′-end mrna mutations that affect mrna stability
and, in consequence, cell cycle regulation, could be a key
step in the process of tumorigenesis for some tumors.
additionally, cells with these types of mutations might obtain
a second advantage over other tumor cells, yielding the
capacity to resist the cytotoxic action of  xxxg2312xxx  poisons.
