glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor blockade improves outcomes in diabetic patients presenting with unstable angina/non-st-elevation myocardial infarcti...  diabetic patients who present with unstable angina or non-st-elevation myocardial infarction suffer a substantially greater incidence of subsequent infarction or death compared with nondiabetic patients. the present study was undertaken to examine whether diabetic patients in the platelet receptor inhibition in ischemic syndrome management in patients limited by unstable signs and symptoms (prism-plus) study appeared to benefit from platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation by  xxxd3385xxx .
