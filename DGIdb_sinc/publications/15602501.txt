individual variability in responses to stimulant drugs may influence risk of stimulant abuse and treatment response. however, the genetic
determinants of this variability have yet to be elucidated. the  xxxg2149xxx  is an important site of amphetamine action.
therefore, the  xxxg2149xxx  gene ( xxxg2149xxx ) is a logical candidate gene to study. using a drug challenge approach, we tested for
association between  xxxg2149xxx  genotype and subjective responses to amphetamine in healthy adults. volunteers participated in a doubleblind, crossover design, randomly receiving placebo, 10 mg, and 20 mg oral d-amphetamine, and completed self-report measures on
subjective effects including anxiety and euphoria. subjects were genotyped for the  xxxg2149xxx  30 -untranslated region vntr polymorphism
and divided into groups based on genotype: homozygous for nine repeats (9/9, n ¼ 8), heterozygous (9/10, n ¼ 36) and homozygous
for 10 repeats (10/10, n ¼ 52). the effects of amphetamine on ratings of feel drug, anxiety, and euphoria were examined with
ancova. in 9/10 and 10/10 subjects, amphetamine produced its expected effects of increased euphoria, anxiety, and feel drug
(po0.01). however, in 9/9 subjects, the effects of amphetamine were indistinguishable from placebo, suggesting that the 9/9 genotype
has diminished subjective response to acute amphetamine. interestingly, recent findings also implicate the 9/9 genotype in decreased
therapeutic response to the stimulant methylphenidate in adhd children. the current findings have important implications for
understanding the genetic determinants of variability in stimulant response and risk of abuse.

introduction
individuals vary markedly in their subjective and behavioral
responses to stimulant drugs. variability has been reported
in clinical settings, such as in response to treatment for
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (spencer et al,
1996) and narcolepsy (mitler et al, 1993). individual
variability has also been reported in the mood-enhancing
effects of stimulants, which are thought to be linked to their
potential for abuse (brauer and de wit, 1996; de wit et al,
1986; gabbay, 2003). there are many potential sources of
this variability, including expectancies (mitchell et al, 1996),
personality (hutchison et al, 1999), psychiatric symptomatology (cesarec and nyman, 1985), sex, and menstrual cycle
phase (white et al, 2002). one further factor that is
receiving considerable attention recently is the possibility

that people vary in responses to drug because of genetic
variations in the function of proteins involved in neurotransmitter action (eg mattay et al, 2003).
a likely source of genetic variation influencing the effects
of amphetamine is in the dopamine system, where
amphetamine acts by altering transporter function, blocking reuptake, and causing reverse transport of intracellular
dopamine, as well as by inducing vesicular release of
dopamine (jones et al, 1998). several lines of evidence link
variations in responses to amphetamine to function of the
 xxxg2149xxx . for example, knockout mice lacking
the  xxxg2149xxx  show a reduced locomotor
response to amphetamine (spielewoy et al, 2001). in
humans, polymorphisms in the  xxxg2149xxx  gene
( xxxg2149xxx ) are associated with variations in both therapeutic
and adverse responses to other stimulants, such as cocaine
and methylphenidate (gelernter et al, 1994; kirley et al,
2003; stein et al, 2002).
 xxxg2149xxx  has a vntr polymorphism in the 30 -untranslated
region (30 -utr) (vandenbergh et al, 1992) that has been
shown to affect gene expression. although there have been
some conflicting reports (jacobsen et al, 2000; martinez
et al, 2001), the longer 10-repeat allele appears to cause
greater  xxxg2149xxx  expression than the nine-repeat allele (fuke

et al, 2001; heinz et al, 2000; mill et al, 2002). further, the
one study examining the nine-repeat homozygous genotype
separately found that this group had lower expression than
either 10-repeat homozygotes or 9/10 heterozygotes (mill
et al, 2002).
several studies have examined the relationship of the
30 -utr vntr polymorphism with response to stimulants.
gelernter et al (1994) reported that cocaine users with the
9/9 and 9/10 genotypes were more likely to experience
cocaine-induced paranoia than cocaine users with the 10/10
genotype. in most studies of response to methylphenidate in
adhd youth (kirley et al, 2003; loo et al, 2003; stein et al,
2002), the clinical response was poorer in patients with the
9/9 and 9/10 genotypes compared to the 10/10 genotype,
although two studies reported increased therapeutic response in the presence of nine-repeat alleles (roman et al,
2004; winsberg and comings, 1999). from these studies it is
not yet clear whether the nine-repeat or the 10-repeat allele
is dominant. notably, whereas most studies have grouped
individuals with any nine-repeat alleles together (ie 9/9 and
9/10) (kirley et al, 2003; loo et al, 2003; roman et al, 2004;
winsberg and comings, 1999), stein et al (2002) analyzed
the nine-repeat homozygotes separately, and found that this
group of adhd patients exhibited a substantially dampened response to increasing doses of methylphenidate
treatment, compared with either the 9/10 or 10/10 patients.
this calls into question the previous combining of 9/9 and
9/10 to match the sample size of the 10/10 sample. differing
results among studies could be due to different proportions
of 9/9 and 9/10 when the two are combined.
in the present study, we examined the interaction
between amphetamine and  xxxg2149xxx  30 -utr genotype using
single doses of d-amphetamine in healthy volunteers, under
highly controlled laboratory conditions. extraneous factors
such as expectancies, variations in subject characteristics,
environmental influences, and drug dosing were controlled,
and sensitive instruments were used to detect effects on a
range of outcome measures. based on the findings reviewed
above, we hypothesized that the 9/9 genotype at  xxxg2149xxx  30 utr would differ from other groups in their subjective
response to acute doses of amphetamine, but the direction
of the difference in response was not easy to predict.

materials and methods
subjects
healthy male and female volunteers (n ¼ 101), aged 18–35
years, were recruited by posters, advertisements, and wordof-mouth referrals. to reduce variability due to tolerance or
withdrawal from nicotine or caffeine, volunteers were
excluded if they smoked more than 10 cigarettes per week
or consumed more than three cups of coffee per day.
candidates underwent a structured clinical psychiatric
interview and a physical examination, and completed
several screening questionnaires. they also completed a
psychiatric symptom checklist (scl-90; (derogatis, 1983)),
the michigan alcoholism screening test (selzer, 1971), and
a health questionnaire with a detailed section on current
and lifetime drug use. all subjects obtained an electrocardiogram and received a physical examination by a
physician. volunteers were excluded if they had any current

medical condition requiring medication, any current or past
medical condition considered to be a contraindication for
amphetamine (eg hypertension, abnormal ekg), any
current axis i psychiatric disorder (american psychiatric
association, 1994, dsm iv), if they had been treated for a
substance use disorder or had a history of legal, personal or
employment problems related to drug use, if they had less
than a high school education, were not fluent in english, or
if they worked a night shift. women who were pregnant or
lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study
were excluded.

design
the study used a three-session crossover design, in which
each subject received placebo and d-amphetamine (10 and
20 mg), under double-blind conditions and in randomized
order. the subjective, physiological, and behavioral
effects of amphetamine were recorded over 4 h after drug
administration. all subjects were genotyped after all
subjects had completed the behavioral phase of the study.
genotyping was performed blind to all behavioral data.

procedure
subjects first attended an orientation session to provide
informed consent, practice tests, and questionnaires,
complete a personality questionnaire, and give a blood
sample for genotyping. subjects were instructed to abstain
from taking drugs, including alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine,
for 24 h before each session and to fast from midnight the
night before the sessions. subjects were tested individually,
and remained in a comfortably furnished room with
television and reading materials for the 4-h session.
subjective and behavioral tasks were administered via
computer. volunteers could watch emotionally neutral
movies and read during the sessions when measurements
were not being taken. the study was approved by the
institutional review board of the university of chicago
and was carried out in accordance with the helsinki
declaration of 1975.
the three sessions were conducted from 0900 to 1300, at
least 48 h apart. women were tested during the follicular
phase of their menstrual cycle because responses to
amphetamine are dampened during the luteal phase (white
et al, 2002). upon arrival in the laboratory for each session,
subjects provided urine and breath samples to confirm drug
and alcohol abstinence, and women were tested for
pregnancy. subjects were given a light meal (bagel with
cream cheese) to reduce stomach irritation from the drug.
they completed precapsule baseline measures including
subjective, behavioral, and physiologic measures. at 0930,
subjects ingested a capsule containing d-amphetamine (10
or 20 mg) or placebo with 100 ml of water. at 30, 60, 90, 150,
and 180 min after capsule ingestion, heart rate, blood
pressure, and temperature were measured, and subjects
completed ratings of drug effects and mood (see below). at
90 min after capsule ingestion, subjects completed two
behavioral tasks measuring impulsive behavior, which will
be reported elsewhere. at 1300, subjects left the laboratory.
previous studies in this laboratory indicate that the

return to near baseline levels within 4 h of oral administration. after completing the three sessions, subjects were
debriefed and paid.

dependent measures
subjective drug effects were assessed using three standardized instrumentsfthe drug effects questionnaire (deq),
the profile of mood states (poms; johanson and uhlenhuth, 1980; mcnair et al, 1971), and the 49-item addiction
research center inventory (arci; martin et al, 1971). the
deq consists of four visual analog scales (vas) on which
subjects rated whether they feel the drug, like the drug, feel
high, and want more. each scale consisted of a 100 mm line
labeled ‘no drug effect at all’ at one end and ‘strong effect’ at
the other (johanson and uhlenhuth, 1980). the poms
(johanson and uhlenhuth, 1980; mcnair et al, 1971) is a 72item adjective checklist with a scale sensitive to several
mood states, including anxiety, depression, vigor, fatigue,
friendliness, anger, elation, arousal, confusion, and positive
mood. the arci (martin et al, 1971) consists of true–false
questions designed to measure drug-specific effects on five
scales: the amphetamine (a) scale, which assesses effects of
amphetamine; the benzedrine group (bg) scale, an amphetamine-sensitive scale measuring intellectual efficiency and
energy; the morphine–benzedrine group (mbg) scale, a
measure of euphoria; the pentobarbital–chlorpromazine–
alcohol group (pcag) scale, which tests levels of sedation,
and the  xxxd2527xxx  (lsd) scale, a measure of
dysphoria and somatic complaints (foltin and fischman,
1991). from these questionnaires, the three primary
measures were selected to capture the prototypic effects of
amphetamine: the deq feel drug scale, the poms anxiety
scale, and the arci mbg (euphoria) scale.
physiological effects, including heart rate and blood
pressure, were measured before capsule administration
and at repeated intervals in the 4 h after the capsule as
described above.

genotyping
pcr was carried out in a 10 ml volume containing 50 ng of
genomic dna, 0.5 mm of each primer, one of which was 50
fluorescently labeled, 200 mm of each dntps, 1  pcr
buffer, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.3 u of dynazymet ext dna
polymerase (finnzymes oy, espoo, finland) and 0.5 m gcmelt (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa). primer sequences were

cycle included an initial denaturation at 961c for 12 min,
followed by 45 cycles consisting of 961c for 30 s, 681c for
45 s, and 721c for 3 min, with a final extension at 721c for
10 min. pcr products were separated on an abi prism

determined using genotyper software (version 3.7 nt)
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa).

9/10, and 10/10). of 101 study participants, one was
excluded because of a missing laboratory sample, and four
others because of having rare alleles. subjective measures
were compared for the three genotyped groups using
separate repeated-measure ancovas (spss 11.0) for each
of the outcome measures. genotype was the grouping
factor, baseline (predrug) scores were used as covariates,
and time (five time points after capsule ingestion) and dose
(0, 10, and 20 mg) were the two within-subjects factors. in
addition, separate one-way anovas were performed using
auc for all 96 subjects together to assess for the presence of
drug response on the primary outcomes when a drug main
effect was not apparent. this additional anova was
necessary in light of the small 9/9 group (n ¼ 8), which
limited the power of the initial analyses. all post hoc
analyses were conducted with independent samples t-test
(spss 11.0 and graphpad quickcalcs) or paired samples ttests as appropriate (spss 11.0). alpha was set at po0.05
(two-tailed) for all analyses.
demographic characteristics for the three groups were
compared using anova or w2 tests. for measures on which
the groups differed, pearson’s r correlations were conducted
for continuous data (current alcohol use) and independent
samples t-tests for dichotomous data (current marijuana
use), with difference in auc between placebo and each drug
dose as the dependent variables to determine whether these
differences contributed to the observed group differences in
outcome measures. in addition, baseline differences across
genotype groups on the three primary outcome measures
were assessed using one-way anova, with placebo trial
predrug score as the dependent measure.
hardy–weinberg equilibrium was analyzed using on-line
resources (http://www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/vetgen/_popgen/
genetik/applets/kitest.htm).

results

allele and genotype frequencies for nine- and 10- repeat
alleles are shown in table 1. four subjects were excluded
from the analyses because they had rare alleles (one with
seven-repeat allele; two with eight-repeat allele; one with
11-repeat allele, all heterozygous with a 10-repeat allele).
the blood sample for one subject was lost. one subject in
the 9/9 group was excluded from analysis on euphoria
because responses were consistently at the top of the scale,
indicating invalid reporting on this scale. the three
genotypes represented by the two most common alleles

table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of the 96
subjects included, grouped by genotype.
the three groups were similar on most demographic
measures including age, gender, and education. however,
consistent with kang et al (1999), none of the subjects in the
9/9 group were asian, whereas 2.8 and 19.2% of the 9/10
and 10/10 groups, respectively, were asian (po0.05). the
groups reported similar current drug use, except that the 9/
10 group reported significantly higher current use of alcohol
and marijuana (po0.05). in separate analyses, we found no
relationship between current alcohol or marijuana use and
responses to amphetamine on each of the three primary
outcome measures. baseline (ie precapsule) scores did not
differ across the genotype groups.

overall amphetamine effects
when data from all subjects were considered together,
amphetamine produced its expected effects on all three
primary outcome measures, with increased euphoria and
feel drug (po0.001, drug main effect from repeatedmeasures ancova), and increased anxiety (po0.02, oneway anova with auc). table 3 summarizes the measures
on which significant drug or group effects were obtained,
and shows that amphetamine significantly increased scores

on arci a, bg, and mbg scales; poms arousal, elation,
friendliness, positive mood, and vigor; and deq feel drug,
high, and want more; and decreased scores on sedation
(arci pcag scale) in the ancova analysis.
for most measures, the drug effects appeared by 60 min
and peaked between 90 and 120 min (see figure 2). on most
measures the effects were also dose-dependent.

genotype differences in drug effects
the effects of d-amphetamine on the three primary outcome
measures varied across genotype groups, although differences did not reach statistical significance on all measures
(table 3, figure 1). amphetamine increased ratings of feel
drug (deq) in the 9/10 and 10/10 groups but not in the 9/9
group. on this measure, the group  drug effect was
significant at po0.02, and post hoc comparisons revealed
significant drug response compared to placebo at both
doses for the 9/10 and 10/10 groups but not the 9/9 group
(po0.05 for low dose and po0.0005 for high dose for both
the 9/10 and 10/10 groups).
the results also suggest a similar pattern for anxiety and
euphoria. the group  drug interaction for anxiety trended
toward significance (po0.09), but no post hoc comparisons
were made because of failure to reach the 0.05 significance
level. however, visual inspection of the graph reveals a
pattern like that for feel drug, with diminished response in
the 9/9 group (figure 1).
in a similar manner, the group  drug interaction for
euphoria did not reach statistical significance, although
there was a significant drug main effect (po0.005). again,
the graph reflects a similar pattern of less response in the
9/9 group than in the 9/10 and 10/10 groups (figure 2). for
euphoria, one subject in the 9/9 group was excluded from
analyses because the responses were consistently at the
maximum of the scale throughout testing, indicating invalid
responding. owing to the already low sample size for the 9/9
group, this exclusion further reduced power to detect
differences. analysis of euphoria with this subject included
produced marginally lower p-values.
analysis of secondary subjective measures revealed two
significant group effects or interactions involving group
(table 3). first, the arci lsd scale had a group  drug
effect (po0.015). post hoc analyses demonstrated that
amphetamine (20 mg) increased lsd scores in the 10/10
group (po0.0005) but not the 9/10 or 9/9 groups (ns).
genotype groups also differed on the deq measure high.
although there were no interactions with group and drug,
visual inspection of the data and post hoc tests suggested
that amphetamine (20 mg) produced higher scores in the
10/10 group than this dose in the 9/10 group (po0.05 for
group effect and post hoc), while the groups did not differ in
scores at amphetamine (10 mg) or placebo. the responses of
the 9/9 group were intermediate between the 9/10 and 10/10
groups.
in the analysis of physiological measures, amphetamine
differentially increased diastolic blood pressure (dbp) with
a group  drug effect of po0.005. as with the primary
outcomes feel drug and anxiety, the effects of drug on dbp
were nonsignificant in the 9/9 group in contrast to the other
groups based on post hoc analyses (po0.01 for high-dose

systolic blood pressure or heart rate.
when ancova analyses of primary outcomes were
repeated with all asian subjects excluded, the results were
unchanged.

discussion
the primary finding of this study was that healthy
volunteers homozygous for the nine-repeat allele of  xxxg2149xxx 
exhibited a pattern of diminished responsiveness to the
subjective effects of acute amphetamine. this was especially
apparent on measures of global drug effect (feel drug),
feeling high, and a measure of dysphoria (arci lsd), and
it was also evident to a lesser extent on measures of anxiety
(poms; figure 1) and euphoria (arci mbg; figure 2).
subjects homozygous for the nine-repeat allele also
exhibited a diminished drug response on a physiological
measure, dbp. some differences detected may have resulted
from greater response of 10/10 subjects, but post hoc
comparisons and overall review of the results support the
presence of a particularly lower response in the 9/9 group.
apart from the apparent differences in responses to
amphetamine, the three genotyped groups also differed in
certain measures independent of drug administration. in
particular, the 9/10 group reported significantly higher
current alcohol and marijuana use than either of the other
two groups (table 1, po0.05), and the proportion of asian
subjects varied across the groups. there are several reasons
to believe that the differences in alcohol and marijuana use
were probably due to chance, and not related to our primary
findings. first, the higher drug use occurred in the 9/10
neuropsychopharmacology

group, whereas the differential responses to amphetamine
occurred in the 9/9 group. second, separate correlational
analysis showed that habitual use of alcohol and marijuana
was not related to responses to amphetamine, in the entire
sample. third, it is unusual for a strong genetic influence to
occur in only the heterozygous group. these considerations
make it unlikely that the differences in drug use contributed
to our findings. the differences in proportions of asians in
the three genotyped groups has been reported previously
(kang et al, 1999). a secondary analysis of primary
outcomes excluding all asians yielded identical results,
demonstrating that this ethnic variation did not influence
our findings.
if  xxxg2149xxx  genotype plays an important role in acute
responses to stimulant drugs, one may ask why the group
differences were not apparent on more of the outcome
measures. the genotype–behavior relationship may be
modest for several reasons. first, amphetamine acts on
several other neurotransmitter systems in addition to its
dopaminergic actions. thus, genetic variation in a single
receptor system is likely to account for only some of the
individual variability in its effects. second, the primary
outcome measures in the present study were self-reports of
mood and subjective states such as anxiety and feeling high,
which are typically associated with relatively high variability, both within and between subjects. therefore, the
magnitude of an effect of genotype must be large to
overcome this variability. third, the small number of
subjects (n ¼ 8) in the 9/9 group greatly diminished the
power to detect group differences, a problem made worse
for euphoria because of the exclusion of one 9/9 subject on
this measure. while the confounding effect of amphetamine’s multiple sites of action, the inherent variability of

figure 1 mean7sem scores on selected measures of drug effects, after
placebo, 10 mg, and 20 mg d-amphetamine in healthy volunteers, grouped
by  xxxg2149xxx  genotypes (x-axis). the number of subjects in each group was
9/9 (n ¼ 8), 9/10 (n ¼ 36), and 10/10 (n ¼ 52). the drug significantly
increased overall mean scores on each of these measures. visual inspection
of the means indicates that responses to d-amphetamine were attenuated
in the 9/9 group. *group  drug effect, po0.05.

subjective reports, and the small 9/9 sample size all limited
the power of our study, several significant genotype group
differences were found.
one compelling reason to believe that these results reflect
a true difference in drug effects between the groups is the
consistency of these findings with studies of methylphenidate in adhd patients. stein et al (2002) observed a
markedly diminished response to methylphenidate treatment in a prospective study of adhd children. while
methylphenidate dose-dependently reduced parental symptom ratings in 9/10 and 10/10 children, children with two
nine-repeat alleles had little therapeutic response. furthermore, two studies have reported lower response to
methylphenidate in adhd patients with the 9/9 genotypes
combined with the 9/10 genotypes using eeg measures
(loo et al, 2003) and parental report clinical measures
(kirley et al, 2003). the finding here of a similar pattern
using amphetamine supports the previous findings of
diminished response to stimulant action in nine-repeat
homozygotes. the  xxxg2149xxx  is an important
part of the therapeutic action of both methylphenidate and
amphetamine, and homozygosity for the 30 -utr polymorphism nine-repeat allele may predict therapeutic
nonresponse for both stimulants. although two other
studies have reported increased therapeutic response in
the presence of any nine-repeat alleles (roman et al, 2004;
winsberg and comings, 1999), studies such as these which
grouped the 9/9 genotypes together with the 9/10 genotypes
are difficult to interpret. variation in previous studies may
have been due to mixing of the 9/9 and 9/10 genotypes, and
future studies should avoid assumptions about the dominance of the nine- or 10-repeat allele.
the present findings may have implications for individual
differences in susceptibility to substance abuse. there is
evidence that individual differences in acute drug responses
(eg pleasurable vs nonpleasurable effects) are predictive of
drug use. for example, initially positive responses to opiates
or cannabis on first use have been linked to susceptibility to

use (fergusson et al, 2003; haertzen et al, 1983). although it
has been difficult to detect associations between  xxxg2149xxx  and
substance abuse or dependence (uhl et al, 2002), this may
be because the phenotype of drug abuse is multifactorial,
and many other nonbiological and nongenetic factors
contribute to the development of drug use. instead, the
endophenotype of acute drug response may be a more
sensitive measure of genetic determinants of abuse and
dependence. in the case of  xxxg2149xxx  and amphetamine, this
study supports a view that homozygosity for the nine-repeat
allele would likely confer protection from dependence on
amphetamine because of a lack of reactivity to the drug.
in this study, we have used a method combining acute
pharmacological challenge and genetic association to study
the genetic determinants of acute drug response. in addition
to the study of risk of addiction, this experimental method
may also be valuable for predicting therapeutic responses to
drugs, particularly when the drug has therapeutic value in
acute administration, as with stimulants. a similar
approach has been taken recently by mattay et al (2003),
who combined this drug challenge method with brain
imaging to show that the cognitive effects of an acute dose
of amphetamine were associated with  xxxg487xxx  genotype. this method may also be valuable for
the study of disease risk whenever an acute drug response is
an endophenotype for a disease, as in the case of addiction.
our results have important implications for future
analyses of the  xxxg2149xxx  30 -utr vntr. most prior studies
have grouped 9/9 and 9/10 subjects together because of the
low occurrence of the 9/9 genotype. however, our results
show the importance of analyzing 9/9 subjects separately.
this is particularly true since our results suggest that the
9/10 group respond more like the 10/10 group than the 9/9
group. thus, combining the 9/9 and 9/10 groups may mask
important differences unique to the 9/9 group. in other
words, the 10-repeat allele appears to behave as a dominant
allele with respect to acute stimulant response as supported
by the results reported here and by stein et al (2002).
paradoxically, the lack of a positive mood response to
stimulants may confer protection from stimulant abuse,
while increasing the risk of nonresponse to stimulant
treatment of adhd. this is consistent with the idea that
risk alleles for one phenotype (ie nonresponse to stimulant
treatment) may confer advantages in other contexts (ie
decreased liability to stimulant abuse).
it is important to consider several limitations of this
study. first, the main limitation of this study is the small
number in the 9/9 group, which limited the power to detect
significant group effects and interactions and lowered the
power of finding other effects in the ancova analyses. in
future studies, it may be preferable to identify sufficient
numbers of subjects with rare genotypes. second, the study
is limited by the selected population of subjects who were
included. it is not known whether these findings would
apply to other or more heterogeneous populations including other races and ethnicities. although the analysis
excluding asian subjects partly addresses this issue, the
problem of population stratification is another limitation of
the study. finally, although three primary outcome
measures were selected a priori, no additional correction
was made for multiple comparisons or multiple phenotypes
apart from the use of ancova.
neuropsychopharmacology

in summary, this study showed that amphetamine
produced smaller effects in individuals with a particular
 xxxg2149xxx  genotype. the results are highly consistent with
recent findings with a different stimulant, methylphenidate,
in a different subject population, adhd patients, and using
different outcome measures, clinical outcome. this convergence of findings across different experimental conditions provides a strong case for an important role for the
 xxxg2149xxx  genotype in stimulant drug response. more generally,
studies that clarify the genetic determinants of drug
response will improve our understanding of the factors
underlying complex drug effects such as addiction and
therapeutic response, and may ultimately allow us to predict
an individual’s response.
