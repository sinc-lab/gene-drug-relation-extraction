tnvoh,ement of histamine h~ receptor in the brains of schizophrenic patients was investigated using ~h- xxxd3050xxx  as a ligand. the specific ~h- xxxd3050xxx  binding in the
frontal cortex was saturable with the dissociation constant (kd) of about 0.6 llm and the
maximum number of binding sites (b .......) of 64 finot/mg protein. spec~c h~ antagonists,
 xxxd3050xxx  (ki = t.4 nm), prontethazbw (ki = t.4 nm),  xxxd1910xxx  (ki = 4. t

in the frontal cortex. representative scatchard analyses of ~he soec[[~c :h- xxxd3050xxx 
binding revealed changes resulting from a decrease in rec:eptor densin, but not in receptor

in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

introduction
histamine was first detected in brain tissue in 1943 (kwiatowski 1943). the peripheral
action of hi:~tamine has long been recognized and only recently has the function of this
amine as a neumtransmitter in the central nervous system been elucidated (lipinski et al
1973; schwartz et al 1980; hough 1988). hnmunohistochemicat analyses revealed evidence of the histaminergic neural system in the mammalian brain (wa~anabe et al 1984;
takeda et al t984; pollard a~d schwartz i987), including the human brain (panuta et al
1990). a variety of actions in the central nervous system were mediated by a pharmacologically distinct subclass of receptors, the h~,h2, and tt3 receptors (schwartz et al
1986). the h~ receptor is involved in physiological functions of sleep and wakefulness

from ~e dcp~ment of pharmacology (tn, tit. yk. nk° l~f) and the depm~tmentof psychiatry and neuretogy inn, tm).

(kalivas 1982), catalepsy (kamei et al 1983), and neuroendocrine regulation (jorgenson
et ai 1989). the psychoactive properties of the h~ antagonists have been examined for
medical purposes (adam and oswald 1986). in schizophrenic patients, sleep disturbance,
hyperarousal, changes in motor activity and eating and drinking disorders are often present.
most neuroleptics generally prescribed for schizophrenic patients have antihistaminic h~
properties (peroutka and snyder 1980; richelson and nelson 1984). all these findings
suggest possible involvement of the h~ receptor in the pathophysioiogy of schizophrenia.
we characterized and localized the h~ receptors in brains from schizophrenic patients
and searched for possible alterations, using 3h- xxxd3050xxx , a potent and specific radioligand for h~ receplors (hilt et al 1977; chang et al 1979a).
methods
brain tissue was obtained at autopsy on 18 japanese patients with chronic schizophrenia
(nine mc~, nine women; age at autopsy, 23.-83 yr; average, 62 yr). schizophrenia was
diagnosed by research psychiatrists based on dsm-ih-r criteria. among the 18 schizophrenic patients, nine were diagnosed as disorganized type (295.12), one as catatonic
(295.22), six as paranoid (295.32), and two as undifferentiated (295.92). ten schizophrenics had received neuroleptic medication just before death, and no medication had
been given to eight patients for at least two months before death (table i). eight among
ten medicated patients had been treated with the hz antagonist promethazine or with
antihistaminic neuroleptics (h0 such as chlorpromazine, thioridazine, and  xxxd3359xxx ,
and two patients had been treated with haloperidol alone, which has little antihistaminic
(hi) effect (peroutka and snyder 1980). for the controls, brains from subjects with no
history of neurological or psychiatric disorders were studied (eight men, five women; age
at autopsy, 35-84 yr; average, 60 yr). the causes of death in those control subjects were
from fatal hemorrhage, heart failure, retroperitoneal tumor, lung abscess, and a fall;
causes of death in the schizophrenic patients were heart failure, pneumonia, gastric cancer~
suffocation, cerebrovascuiar disease, ileus, and peritonitis.
at autopsy, the brains were dissected and stored at -75°(2. the inte~als between
death and autopsy were 3-36 hr (average 13.1 hr) for the schizophrenics and 2-22 hr
(average 8.3 hr) for the controls. there was no significant difference between controls
and schizophrenics with regard to age, sex, or the time interval from death to autopsy.
the brain tissues were weighed, homogenized in 20 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm na +k + n h c ~ n h ~ t ~ h!,¢¢~,- ph " ~ (at ~,

~..~,with a poiytron (kinematica pt-10; setting of 7.

drugs on 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding, a 10-rain preincubation at 37°c was carried out (burt
et al 1976). the resulting pellets were washed three times by repeated centrifugation and
resuspended in the same buffer. the preparations (about 1 mg protein/ml) were incubated
with 3h- xxxd3050xxx  (32.3 ci/mmol, new england nuclear, boston, ma) in !.5 ml of
the same buffer, for 25 rain at 25°c. the optimal assay conditions were obtained in
prelimina ~xperiments. the specific 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding to the h~ receptor was
defined as ti,e radioactivity bound after subtraction of the nonspecific binding determined
in the presence of 2 ~m triprolidine. for the saturation experiments, 3h- xxxd3050xxx 
concentrations were varied between 0.125 and 10 nm and other experiments were performed with 2 nm of the radioligand. after incubation, the mixture was rapidly passed

to the filter (bruns et al 1983). the filters were then rinsed three times with 8 ml of the
ice-cold buffer and the radioactivity on the dried filter was counted by liquid scintillation
spectrometry. the protein concenuation was determined by ~ c method of lowry et al
1951). statistical analysis was carried out, using the two-tailed student's t test.

results
the specific 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding to the frontal cortex reached equilibrium values
within 20 rain after incubation at 25°c. the specific binding increased linearly with a
protein concentration up to 4 mg/ml (data not shown). vve carried out the saturation
experiments on the frontal cortex obtained from five controls. the nonspecific binding
increased linearly, whereas the specific binding showed a typical saturation pattern (figure
1a). scatchard plots for the specific ~h- xxxd3050xxx  binding to the frontal cortex showed
a single component of the binding, with the dissociation constant (kd) of 0.6 nm and
the maximal number of binding sites ( b ~ ) of 64 fmol/mg protein (figure 1b). inhibition
of the specific component of the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding by various drugs was then
studied. the h~ antagonists  xxxd3050xxx  (ki = !.4 nm), promethazine (ki = !.4 nm),
 xxxd1910xxx  (ki = 4. ! n m ) , triprolidine (ki = 5.3 nm), and diphenhydramine (ki
= 35 nm) were potent competitors for the specific binding of 3h- xxxd3050xxx . on the
contrary, the h2 antagonist cimetidine (ki > 100000 nm) proved to be an extremely
weak competitor for the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding. histamine itself, with a ki of 22 ~m,
is substantially weaker than the h,~ antihistamines. these results are in good agreement
with data obtained on the bovine cerebral cortex (kubo et al 1987).
the specific 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding in control brains was unevenly distributed, with
the highest binding noted in the frontal cortex. percentages of the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding
in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and hypothalamus to the frontal cortex were 45%, 36%,
and 30%, respectively. in the thalamus, putarnen and globus pallidus, the specific 31-1mepyramine binding was lowest, being about 20% of the binding in the frontal cortex
(figure 2).
the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding (2 nm) in the frontal cortex from 18 schizophrenic patientg
was compared with findings in 13 control bra?,ns. there was a significant decrase in 3h-

there was large variation in the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding among the individual patients,
there was no significant correlation between 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding and the time interval

3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding was very low, but there were no specific clinical features such
as sleep disturbance and motor activity, which differed from findings in other samples.

discussion
we obtained evidence that 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binds to one distk~ct site in human brain
membranes. other investigators reported multiple binding sites in calf and guinea pig
brains (chang et al t97%; hadfietd et al 1983). the bn~ and kd values obtained in our
studies are consistent with those reported by chang et al (1979b). the specific 3hmepyramine binding in the human brain was unevenly localized and the distribution
pattern differed from that seen in other mammals. the highest binding was found in the
hypothalamus of rats (tran et al 1978; chang et al 1979b) and cats (taylor et al 1982),
and in the cerebellum of guinea pig (tran et ai 1978; chang et al 1979b). in humans,
monkeys (bielkiewicz and cook 1985), and calves (chang et al 1979b), the cerebral
cortex showed the highest binding. the reported distribution of the 3h- xxxd3050xxx 
binding in the human brain differs from our results. chang et al (1979b) stated that binding
to the cerebellum was about 10% of the value in the frontal cortex, whereas, in our study,
it was about 36% of the value in the frontal cortex. the binding activities reported by
chang et al are expressed as picomoles per gram wet weight tissue, whereas the values

t. nakai et al

|991 ;30:349--356

in our study are expressed as fentmoles per mg protein. because it is probable that the
protein concentration in the cerebellum is less than that in the frontal cortex, chang et
al may have underestimated binding activity in tile cerebellum. our results also differ
from the data using 3h-doxepine as a ligand (kanba and richelson 1984). the discrepancy
appears to come from the difference in assay condition and because 3h-doxepine binds
to a subclass of histamine h~ receptors (taylor and richelson 1982). the regional distribution of the specific 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding differs from that of the endogenous
histamine or  xxxg1040xxx  activity (lipinski et al 1973; barbin et al 1980) or
histamine-like immunoreactivities (panula et al 1990). in the case of gaba (enna et al
i975),  xxxg2328xxx  (burr and snyder 1975), serotonin (bennett and
snyder 1976). and ot-(u'prichard et al 1977) and 13-adrenergic re-ceptors (bylund and
snyder 1976), there are similar discrepancies between the regional distribution of neurotransmitter and receptor binding.
we found a significant reduction in the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding activity in the frontal
cortex of the brain from schizophrenic patients. scatchard analy~s revealed that the decreased binding was due to a decrease in the number of binding sites. the effect of residual
drugs on the binding can be ruled out as the membranes were washed thoroughly after 10
min preincubation at 37°(2 (burt et al 1976). second, the influence of the drug-free interval
on the binding could be disregarded as we found no significant difference in the binding
between on-drug and off-drug patients. in human subjects, the influence of long-term neuroleptic treatment on the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding remains unclear. in rats, chronic administration (6 months) of  xxxd3431xxx , a neuroleptic drug with an antihistaminic (h,) potency led to no change in the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding (theodorou et al 1981). treatment of
the mature guinea pig with  xxxd3050xxx  did not alter the b,,~ or kd value of 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding sites in membranes from different brain regions (hill et al 1981). t~'eating rat
pups with diphenhydramine or  xxxd3050xxx  increased the b,~,of the 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding sites in the whole brain an¢ in the hypothalamus, with no change in the kd (subramanian et al 198 t). thus the reduced density in 3h-mepyramire binding in the frontal cortex of
our schizophrenic patients doe~ not seem to be related to the effect of residual drugs in samples or to the influence of lcng-term ingestion of neuroleptics.
with the combination of immunohistochemistry, retrograde tracing experiments and lesion studies, histamine neurons have been shown to emanate from the magnocellular hypothalamic histamine perikarya and directly innervate large areas in the mammalian brain,
including that: of humans (takeda et al 1984; panula et al 1990). the highly divergent topography of the major histamine pathways is analogous to that of catecholamine mad serotonin and suggests a modulatory role of histamine in the release of these monoamines. histamine regulates the release of dopamine (philippu et al 1984, knigge et al 1986) whose
hyperactivity in neurotransmission at meso- xxxd1751xxx -limbic areas probably plays a key role
in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. down-regulatkm of the histamine h) rec~eptormay
relate to the hyperactive dopaminergic system in patients with schizophrenia.
