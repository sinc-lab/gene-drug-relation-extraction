abstract
administration of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-n-nitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx ) inhibits hepatic activities of  xxxg981xxx  (gr) comparably in both adult male fischer-344 (f344) and sprague–dawley (sd) rats in vivo.  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment greatly exacerbates
the hepatic necrosis caused by diquat in f344 rats, but does not similarly potentiate liver injury in sd rats. the primary purpose
of the present studies was to test the hypothesis that  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment would exhibit differences between the two strains in
inhibition of gr activities in hepatic subcellular compartments that would correlate with the differing effects on diquat-induced
hepatic necrosis. in the present studies, 16 h after administration of 80 mg/kg of  xxxd444xxx , gr activities in the hepatic homogenates
were 20–30% of activities in vehicle-treated controls. neither the extents of inhibition nor the gr activities in hepatic cytosol,
microsomes, mitochondria, or purified nuclei isolated by differential centrifugation were different between sd and f344 rats
treated with  xxxd444xxx . the results indicate that differences between sd and f344 rats in the effects of  xxxd444xxx  on susceptibilities to
diquat-induced hepatic necrosis are not readily attributable to compartmentally selective inhibition of gr. in addition, hepatic
o6 -alkylguanine-dna alkyltransferase (agt, mgmt) levels were almost completely depleted in  xxxd444xxx -treated rats of both
strains, thus indicating that mgmt-dependent pathways are unlikely to be critical determinants of the effects of  xxxd444xxx  on this
model of acute cell death mediated by reactive oxygen species in vivo.

responsible for expression of many toxicities and
human diseases (smith, 1992), but the specific molecular mechanisms have not been defined sufficiently
(smith, 1991). in efforts to elucidate the critical modifications and mechanisms of injury, particularly for
mechanisms that are potentially relevant in vivo, the
acute hepatic necrosis caused by administration of
diquat has been an exceptionally useful animal model
(blakeman et al., 1998; fu et al., 1999; rikans et al.,
1997; smith et al., 1985).
diquat administration elicits dose-dependent increases of biliary efflux of  xxxd2811xxx 
( xxxd2811xxx ), which serves as a useful biomarker of exposure to reactive oxygen species (gupta et al.,
2000; lauterburg et al., 1984; smith, 1987a,b). further, increased levels of  xxxd2811xxx  could contribute to
mechanisms of oxidant injury through thiol-disulfide
exchange reactions, resulting in s-thiolation of critical proteins (gilbert, 1995; jones et al., 2002;
smith and welty, 1999). the rates of biliary  xxxd2811xxx 
efflux in diquat-treated f344 rats were greater
than in sprague–dawley (sd) rats given equal
doses of diquat, which correlated with the greater
susceptibilities of f344 rats to hepatic necrosis by diquat. however, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-nnitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx )-pretreated sd rats given nonlethal doses of diquat produced  xxxd2811xxx  efflux rates
that greatly exceeded the rates observed in f344
rats given hepatotoxic doses of diquat, yet minimal hepatic necrosis was observed in the bcnupretreated sd rats treated with diquat (smith,
1987a). in contrast,  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment greatly exacerbated diquat-induced hepatic necrosis in f344
rats.
the effects of  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment on drug toxicities are most commonly attributed to inhibition of
 xxxg981xxx  (gr), an enzyme that functions
to reduce  xxxd2811xxx  back to gsh (kehrer, 1983; kehrer
et al., 1979; kehrer and paraidathathu, 1984; smith
et al., 1983). the  xxxd444xxx  pretreatments employed in
our previous studies of the effects of  xxxd444xxx  on diquat
hepatotoxicity in vivo (smith, 1987a) gave equivalent
(70–80%) extents of inhibition of hepatic gr activities in the two strains.
inhibition of gr would most logically affect
the ability of cells to maintain gsh concentrations at levels sufficient to sustain cell viability or
to limit increases in  xxxd2811xxx -driven s-thiolation of

proteins. depletion of hepatic gsh levels is observed in diquat-treated rats, but much greater decreases of hepatic gsh levels are tolerated without
loss of viability (mitchell et al., 1973). in addition, diquat-induced decreases in hepatic gsh levels
were not potentiated in  xxxd444xxx -pretreated animals
(smith, 1987a). further, measurable depletion of
hepatic protein thiol (psh) levels, as might be expected from accumulation of  xxxd2811xxx , has not been
observed with diquat, even in  xxxd444xxx -pretreated
rats, with the methods of analysis employed to date
(gupta et al., 1997; smith, 1987a; smith et al.,
1985).
an alternative hypothesis is that administration of
 xxxd444xxx  in vivo inhibits gr activities in hepatic subcellular compartments differentially in the two strains.
although the product of a single nuclear gene, gr activities are expressed in mitochondria and nuclei and
have been observed in association with subnuclear
structures that isolated with hepatic nucleoli (tamura
et al., 1996; rogers et al., 2002). the primary purpose of the present studies was to test the hypothesis
that potentiation by  xxxd444xxx  of diquat-induced hepatic
necrosis in f344, but not in sd rats, correlates with
subcellular compartmental selectivity in inhibition of
gr activities.
although  xxxd444xxx  does inhibit gr, the enhanced
cytotoxicities of other toxicants in  xxxd444xxx -pretreated
cells in vitro have correlated more closely with the
dna cross-links that  xxxd444xxx  forms than with inhibition of gr, unless the time between  xxxd444xxx  treatment and toxicant challenge is sufficient (12–24 h)
to allow for repair of the dna lesions, which is
more rapid than is recovery of gr activities (bodell
et al., 1986; tong et al., 1982). in the present studies, we therefore also tested the hypothesis that
differences in levels of a primary means of dna
repair,
dna-o6 -methylguanine:protein-l-cysteine
s-methyltransferase (mgmt), also called o6 -alkylguanine-dna alkyltransferase (agt), [ xxxg1404xxx ]
in  xxxd444xxx -treated f344 and sd rats would correlate
with susceptibilities to diquat-induced hepatic damage (cai et al., 2000; lim et al., 1999). evidence
supporting either of these working hypotheses would
have important implications for fundamental mechanisms of cell killing by reactive oxygen species
and for more focused uses of a clinically important
drug.

2. materials and methods

2.3. subcellular fractionation

2.1. reagents

fresh livers were homogenized in ice-cold 0.25 m
sucrose with a dounce homogenizer, seven strokes
with the loose pestle and then seven strokes with the
tight pestle, to make 10% (w/v) homogenates. after
tissue homogenization, 1 ml portions of the 10% homogenates were set aside as the whole homogenate
fractions. the remainders of the homogenates were
centrifuged at 900 × g for 20 min, to pellet the crude
nuclear fractions. the resulting supernatants were centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g for 20 min, to pellet the mitochondrial fractions, and the supernatants from this
higher speed spin were centrifuged at 105,000 × g
for 60 min. the resultant supernatants were collected
as the cytosolic fractions, and the pellets contained
the microsomal fractions. the pellets from the original 900 × g spins were resuspended in the original volumes of 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged again
900 × g for 20 min. the pellets thus obtained were
resuspended in 4 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, laid over 4 ml
of 2.3 m sucrose, and these samples were centrifuged
at 37,000 × g for 30 min. the pinkish materials forming a collar around the inside of the centrifuge tubes
were collected as the purified nuclear fractions of the
respective samples. the mitochondrial pellets were
washed similarly by resuspension in original volumes
of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose, followed by centrifugation
 xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g for 20 min. subcellular fractions were
resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, incubated with 0.1%
(v/v) triton x-100 on ice for 15 min prior to gr and
gpx activity assays and protein analyses.

 xxxd444xxx  was provided generously by bristol-myers
squibb. anti-mgmt antibody and recombinant
mgmt were prepared as described previously (lim
et al., 1999). gsh,  xxxd2811xxx , nadph, 5-5 -dithio-bis(2nitrobenzoic acid) dtnb,  xxxd2684xxx  (nem),
h2 o2, and bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). protein assay
reagent, laemmli buffer, and goat, anti-rabbit igg
(h + l)-hrp were purchased from bio-rad laboratories (hercules, ca). mouse monoclonal ␤-actin antibody was purchased from abcam (cambridge, uk),
and goat anti-mouse igg (h + l) was purchased from
gibco brl (gaithersburg, md).  xxxg981xxx  was purchased from roche applied science (indianapolis, in). ecl chemiluminescence reagents were
purchased from amersham lifesciences inc. (arlington heights, il). western reprobetm buffer was purchased from genotechnology inc. (st. louis, mo). all
other chemicals were purchased at the highest available quality through fisher scientific (pittsburgh, pa).
2.2. animal protocol
all animal study protocols were approved by the
iacuc at columbus children’s research institute.
adult (8 weeks of age) male sprague–dawley and
fischer-344 (f344) rats were purchased from harlan
sprague–dawley (indianapolis, in) and were maintained in the children’s research institute (cri)
vivarium in a temperature-controlled room on a 12 h
light/dark cycle. food and drinking water were available ad libitum. the animals were adapted for at least
5 days before study. rats were given either 80 mg/kg
of  xxxd444xxx  or equal volumes of corn oil, i.p. at 16 h
post dose, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and livers, lungs, and kidneys were removed.
portions of the tissues were weighed and placed in
ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose for homogenization and measurements of  xxxg981xxx  and glutathione
peroxidase (gpx) activities. the remaining tissues
were freeze-clamped with liquid nitrogen-cooled
aluminum blocks and stored at −80 ◦ c for measurements of glutathione (gsh) and  xxxd2811xxx 
( xxxd2811xxx ) concentrations.

2.4.  xxxg981xxx  activities
gr activities were assayed according to the method
of rogers et al. (2002). fifty microlitres of sample
were added to 200 ␮l of the assay mixture (0.1 m tris,
ph 8.0, 1.14 mm edta, 6.95 mm  xxxd2811xxx  in 0.1 m
tris, ph 7.0, and 0.26 mm nadph), and the rates of
change in absorbance at 340 nm were measured on a
microtiter plate reader (dynatech technologies inc.,
chantilly, va).
2.5. glutathione peroxidase activities
gpx activities were determined according to
the method of lawrence and burk (1976). fifty

222

k.s. jopperi-davis et al. / toxicology letters 147 (2004) 219–228

microlitres of sample were added to 200 ␮l of reaction mixture 1 (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer,
ph 7, 4 mm nan3 , 0.15 mm nadph, 1 u/ml
gr, and 5.26 mm gsh), allowed to incubate for
5 min at room temperature, and were mixed with
50 ␮l of 0.44 mm h2 o2 to initiate the reaction.
absorbances at 340 nm were recorded for 5 min,
and the activities were calculated from the rates
of change as ␮mol nadph oxidized per min.
rates obtained for blank reactions with enzyme
source and distilled water were subtracted from each
assay.
2.6. protein concentrations
protein concentrations were determined using the
biorad protein assay. twenty-five microlitres of the
triton x-100 supernatants were diluted with water as
needed and were mixed with 200 ␮l of dye (diluted
1:5), and the absorbances at 600 nm were measured
with a microtiter plate reader. the protein concentrations were calculated using experimentally derived standard curves constructed with bovine serum
albumin.
2.7. gsh concentrations
total gsh levels (tgsh = gsh + 2gssg) in
liver supernatants were measured by gr enzyme recycling methods as described by rogers and smith
(2003), rogers et al. (2000). a piece of frozen tissue was homogenized in 0.1 m napo4 , ph 7.4 and
5 mm edta (hb), to make 10% (w/v) homogenates,
which were incubated in 0.1% triton x-100 for
15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min
at 4 ◦ c. for tgsh determinations, 30 ␮l of the supernatants, diluted appropriately with water, were
mixed with 120 ␮l of hb, 50 ␮l of reaction mixture
1 (75 ␮l of gr (∼38 u); 313 ␮l of 10 mm dtnb,
and 4.38 ml of hb) and 50 ␮l of reaction mixture
2 (5 mg nadph in 5 ml of hb). the tgsh concentrations were determined from measurements of
rates of change in absorbance at 410 nm and calculated using experimentally derived standard curves
constructed with  xxxd2811xxx . gsh concentrations were
calculated by subtracting  xxxd2811xxx  levels from the tgsh
levels.

2.8.  xxxd2811xxx  concentrations
samples were homogenized as described above for
gsh, with the exception that 10 ␮l of 1 m nem was
added to the hb before addition of the frozen tissues.
homogenates were incubated in 0.1% triton x-100
for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min
at 4 ◦ c. pellets were discarded and 200 ␮l of the supernatants were loaded on c18 sep-pak cartridges
(waters, milford, ma, usa) and eluted with 800 ␮l
hb. two hundred microlitres of the eluents, diluted
appropriately with water, were mixed with 50 ␮l of reaction mixture 1 and 50 ␮l of reaction mixture 2, and
 xxxd2811xxx  concentrations were determined from rates of
change in absorbance at 410 nm, and calculated using
experimentally derived standard curves constructed
with  xxxd2811xxx .
2.9. western analyses
liver tissues (0.1 ± 0.01 g) from corn oil and
 xxxd444xxx -treated animals were homogenized with
teflon-glass in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose. the
resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g
for 15 min at 4 ◦ c. supernatants were decanted, and
protein concentrations were determined. liver supernatants were solubilized in laemmli buffer (2.5%
sds, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mmol/l tris, ph 6.8, 5%
2- xxxd26xxx ). after boiling for 5 min, equal
amounts (100 ␮g) of protein per sample were loaded
on 12% sds-polyacrylamide gels with 4% stacking
gels. a 2.5 ng sample of rmgmt protein was used
as a control. proteins were separated and transferred
onto sequi-blot pvdf membranes (0.2 ␮m, biorad;
hercules, ca). membranes were incubated overnight
at 4 ◦ c in tbs-t containing 5% milk. membranes
were then incubated for 2 h with a 1:200 dilution of
rabbit, anti-rat mgmt antibody. after three washes
with tbs-t, membranes were incubated with a
1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit igg (h + l)
hrp conjugate antibody for 1 h. the membranes
were washed three times with tbs-t and visualized
with ecl. membranes were stripped and reprobed
with anti-mouse ␤-actin antibody at a dilution of
1:5000 for 2 h. membranes were washed as described
above and incubated in goat anti-mouse igg (h + l)
hrp conjugate antibody for 1 h. membranes were
washed and visualized by ecl. band intensities were

quantitated using labworks imaging and analysis
software (upland, ca). mgmt band intensities were
normalized against the respective ␤-actin intensities.
2.10. statistics
data are expressed as mean ±s.e.m. data were analyzed with two-way anova, with dose and strain as
independent variables, and modified t-tests post hoc.
all analyses were performed using spss for windows
(spss version 10.0.5, chicago, il). statistical significance was attributed at p < 0.05. mgmt band intensities were evaluated for outliers using the grubb
test (graphpad, san diego, ca), which resulted in
one data point from each  xxxd444xxx -treated group (sd
and f344) indicated as outliers that were omitted from
subsequent analyses.

3. results
no animals died prior to anesthesia and exsanguination. gr activities were 10–15% greater in
homogenates from livers of control sd rats than
from f344 rats (fig. 1). gr activities in the hepatic
homogenates of the  xxxd444xxx -treated animals reflected
the uniform inhibition of 70–80% of normal gr activities, and neither the extents of inhibition nor the

223

homogenate gr activities were different between sd
and f344 rats treated with  xxxd444xxx . liver homogenate
gpx activities were not different between strains
and showed no effects of  xxxd444xxx  treatment (fig. 1b).
liver gsh concentrations were not different between
sd and f344 rats, and were greater in  xxxd444xxx -treated
animals than in controls (fig. 2a).  xxxd2811xxx  levels were
higher in the livers of the  xxxd444xxx -treated animals than
in the controls (fig. 2b), but were not different between strains, either in controls or in  xxxd444xxx -treated
animals. hepatic gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratios exhibited no
effects of dose or strain (data not shown).
overall, the effects of  xxxd444xxx  on gr activities in
the hepatic subcellular fractions examined were to
produce uniformly lower activities in both strains of
rats (fig. 3). in rats not treated with  xxxd444xxx , gr activities in the liver cytosolic fractions were slightly
higher in sd rats than in f344 rats. however, in the
 xxxd444xxx -treated animals, none of the fractional gr activities were different between sd and f344 rats. gr
activities in subcellular fractions of  xxxd444xxx -treated animals were inhibited uniformly by 72–85% of the
corresponding activities in the control animals (p <
0.001 for effect of  xxxd444xxx , but no difference between
strains), with the exception of the mitochondrial gr
activities, which were inhibited in sd and f344 rat livers by 62 and 53%, respectively. comparable extents
of inhibition of gr were observed in homogenates and

refinements.
hepatic gpx activities in subcellular fractions
showed some differences by strain or drug treatment,
specifically that gpx activities were lower in mitochondria from livers of control f344 rats than of

sd rats, and  xxxd444xxx  treatment resulted in lower gpx
activities in microsomal and cytosolic fractions from
treated than from control sd rats (fig. 4). however,
no differences in fractional gpx activities between

differences in protein levels between the two strains of
rats were indicated. the western analyses showed several immunoreactive bands in addition the ones matching the 26 kda molecular weight of the protein, but
densitometries were only assessed for the bands that
corresponded to the molecular weight of the recombinant protein. variability in the mgmt protein levels
was observed, but with the dose of  xxxd444xxx  employed,
the overall effect of the  xxxd444xxx  treatment was to diminish substantially the liver mgmt protein levels in
both the sd and f344 rats.

4. discussion
the present data do not support the working hypothesis that strain-dependent differences in inhibition of subcellular hepatic gr activities are likely to
account for the marked potentiation of diquat-induced
hepatic necrosis in f344 rats, but not in sd rats
(smith, 1987a). the data are derived from fractions
obtained by differential centrifugation of whole tissue
homogenates and are therefore subject to all of the
limitations inherent in such approaches, not the least
of which is that microsomes do not exist in intact

cells and tissues. however, we included data from
measurements made with microsomal fractions isolated in the tissue fractionation procedures employed
in our studies to provide a more complete coverage
of possible effects.
the limited extent of depletion of hepatic gsh
and the absence of measurable loss of psh contents
observed in animals given hepatotoxic doses of diquat (gupta et al., 1997; smith, 1987a; smith et al.,
1985) indicate that significant compartmentalization
of the critical effects are implicated, if gr is essential to antioxidant defense mechanisms through
reduction of  xxxd2811xxx . the analytical methods applied
to date to questions of psh status are heavily influenced by abundance of each protein assessed and
the numbers of thiol groups on each protein. target
proteins that are critical determinants of cell viability
during oxidant stresses are not necessarily the most
abundant proteins. identification of low-abundance
proteins for which changes in redox status may be
critical to cell viability will require substantial improvements in analytical methodologies and critical
application of experimental models of toxicity (lind
et al., 2002). preferential inhibition by  xxxd444xxx  of compartmental gr activities in correlation with increased

fig. 5. effects of  xxxd444xxx  on rat liver mgmt protein levels. supernatants (100 ␮g of protein) from 15,000×g spin of liver whole homogenates
were separated on 12% sds-polyacrylamide gels, with rmgmt (2.5 ng) as a positive control. proteins were transferred semidry onto
pvdf membranes and probed with a primary rabbit anti-rat mgmt antibody and a secondary hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody.
the band at ∼26 kda, corresponding to the expected size of the rmgmt, was quantified by ecl. membranes were stripped and re-probed
similarly with an anti-␤-actin antibody. densitometries of the mgmt bands were then normalized to the densitometries of their respective
␤-actin bands. data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m., n = 5–6 per group. (*) effect of dose, no effect of strain, no interaction. data

sensitivity to diquat-induced damage would have provided pharmacological clues for focusing efforts to
identify the putative critical targets, but this was not
observed.
we also considered the possibility that the differences between f344 and sd rats in their responses
to  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment and diquat challenge might be
mediated by strain differences in hepatic mgmt status. in addition to inhibition of gr,  xxxd444xxx  alkylates
dna, and chloroethylation of the o6 position of guanine residues can lead to interstrand and dna-protein
cross-linking reactions, which correlate with cytotoxic
effects (bodell et al., 1985; maze et al., 1996). removal of an o6 -alkyl group from deoxyguanosine by
mgmt is not a catalytic reaction, but stoichiometri-

cally alters the protein. thus, mgmt status is restored
by de novo synthesis of new protein. a correlation between effects of  xxxd444xxx  on mgmt status and on diquat
hepatotoxicity in the two strains of rats would have
suggested further investigation of dna alterations on
diquat-induced hepatic necrosis and would have implicated a greater fundamental importance of dna
modifications in other examples of oxidant-mediated
cell killing. we had previously observed no increase
in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine contents in hepatic dna
of f344 rats given hepatotoxic doses of diquat (gupta
et al., 1997), but diquat does cause increases in fragmentation of hepatic dna that could be detected prior

the evidence that reactive oxygen species and other
oxidants are important contributors to numerous disease processes and toxicities is strong. the specific
molecular transformations that are critical to mediating the biological responses associated with oxidant
damage have been elusive, but research in the area
continues to indicate that the toxicologically relevant
alterations appear to be far less simplistic and far
more specific than often has been assumed (smith,
1991).
