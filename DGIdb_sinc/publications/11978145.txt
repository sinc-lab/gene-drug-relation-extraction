current research in parkinson’s disease (pd) focuses on symptomatic therapy
and neuroprotective interventions. drugs that have been used for symptomatic
therapy are levodopa, usually combined with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, synthetic dopamine receptor agonists, centrally-acting antimuscarinic drugs,
amantadine,  xxxg1358xxx -b (mao-b) inhibitors and catechol-omethyltransferase (comt) inhibitors. drugs for which there is at least some
evidence for neuroprotective effect are certain dopamine agonists, amantadine
and mao-b inhibitors (selegiline).
levodopa remains the most effective drug for the treatment of pd. several
factors contribute to the complex clinical pharmacokinetics of levodopa: erratic
absorption, short half-life, peripheral o-methylation and facilitated transport
across the blood-brain barrier. in patients with response fluctuations to levodopa,
the concentration-effect curve becomes steeper and shifts to the right compared
with patients with stable response. pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling can affect decisions regarding therapeutic strategies.
the dopamine agonists include ergot derivatives (bromocriptine, pergolide,
 xxxd2498xxx  and cabergoline), non-ergoline derivatives (pramipexole,  xxxd3145xxx  and
piribedil) and apomorphine. most dopamine agonists have their specific pharmacological profile. they are used in monotherapy and as an adjunct to levodopa in
early and advanced pd.
few pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are available regarding centrally acting antimuscarinic drugs. they are characterised by rapid absorption
after oral intake, large volume of distribution and low clearance relative to hepatic
blood flow, with extensive metabolism.
the mechanism of action of amantadine remains elusive. it is well absorbed
and widely distributed. since elimination is primarily by renal clearance, accumulation of the drug can occur in patients with renal dysfunction and dosage
reduction must be envisaged.
the comt inhibitors  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  dose-dependently inhibit the
formation of the major metabolite of levodopa, 3-o-methyldopa, and improve
the bioavailability and reduce the clearance of levodopa without significantly
affecting its absorption. they are useful adjuncts to levodopa in patients with
end-of-dose fluctuations.
the mao-b inhibitor selegiline may have a dual effect: reducing the catabolism of dopamine and limiting the formation of neurotoxic free radicals. the

pharmacokinetics of selegiline are highly variable; it has low bioavailability and
large volume of distribution. the oral clearance is many-fold higher than the
hepatic blood flow and the drug is extensively metabolised into several metabolites, some of them being active.
despite the introduction of several new drugs to the antiparkinsonian armamentarium, no single best treatment exists for an individual patient with pd.
particularly in the advanced stage of the disease, treatment should be individually
tailored.

although apomorphine was first suggested for
the treatment of parkinsonism in 1884,[1] the introduction of atropine and scopolamine, at the end of
the nineteenth century, were the first attempts towards the palliative treatment of parkinson’s disease (pd). the belladonna-like agents have been
used for symptomatic relief since that time. in the
early 1950s, these natural alkaloids were replaced
by the synthetic centrally-acting antimuscarinic
drugs, which have a more favourable adverse effect
profile. however, these agents did not improve
symptoms such as akinesia and bradykinesia,
which were still the cause of major disability. the
discovery that levodopa (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl
 xxxd2428xxx dopa) reversed the parkinsonian syndrome induced by reserpine in animals, followed
by the mapping of the regional distribution of dopamine in human brain led, in the 1960s, to the
crucial observation of selective neostriatal dopamine deficiency in brain of patients with pd.[2]
this pivotal breakthrough led to the major advance
in palliative therapy for pd, dopamine replacement
therapy, and announced a modern era of understanding the role of dopamine in the brain. although the initial clinical trials used the less expensive racemic mixture of d,l-dopa,[3] it quickly
became clear that the active isomer, levodopa, was
much
more effective, without risking
granulocytopenia. at the same time bartholini et
al.[4] discovered that following inhibition of peripheral decarboxylase levodopa enhanced cerebral concentrations of catecholamines.
three decades after its introduction, levodopa is
still the mainstay of therapy for this disabling neurodegenerative disorder. in spite of this, many aspects of the pharmacology of levodopa remain unsolved, and long term adverse effects such as motor

response fluctuations (end-of-dose akinesia or
wearing-off phenomenon, ‘on-off’ fluctuations,
freezing, ‘early-morning’ dystonia and dyskinesias) and neuropsychiatric manifestations tend to
emerge during chronic treatment. central pharmacodynamic mechanisms such as reduced striatal
synthesis and storage of dopamine from exogenous
levodopa and subsensitisation of postsynaptic
dopaminergic receptors have been invoked in the
pathogenesis of these motor complications. these
problems have prompted the development of new
classes of antiparkinsonian drugs such as synthetic
dopamine receptor agonists, monoamine oxidaseb (mao-b) inhibitors and catechol-omethyltransferase (comt) inhibitors, which were
introduced in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, respectively. their chemical structures are depicted in
figure 1 and figure 2.
the purpose of this article is to review the available data on the clinical pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of established antiparkinsonian drugs as well as agents in the late stage of clinical development. pharmacodynamic effects discussed will be those relevant to pd patients rather
than those observed in volunteers (phase i studies).
analytical methods used for the quantification of
these compounds will be briefly discussed. the
mechanism of action of the various agents and
pharmacological management of pd have been extensively discussed elsewhere.[5,6]

the unique and complex pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic features of levodopa have been
the focus of substantial investigative attention.

precursor molecule, levodopa, is still the most effective therapeutic agent in the management of pd.
it is particularly effective for the most disabling
features of the disease, bradykinesia and rigidity,
while its effect on tremor is variable. levodopa is
a naturally occurring amino acid, which is not a
component of structural proteins. it has a major
role as immediate metabolic precursor for all catecholamines and is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways. the principal metabolic pathways
for levodopa are depicted in figure 3. rich dietary
sources of levodopa are the seedlings, pods, and
beans of the broad bean, vicia faba. ingestion of
the latter produces a substantial increase in plasma
levodopa levels with associated improvement in
motor performance in pd patients.[7]
1.1 analytical methods

ion-pair reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with electrochemical
detection is by far the most reliable, fastest and
most sensitive method for the determination and
quantification of levodopa, dopamine and their metabolites in biological fluids.[8,9] detection limits
in plasma for levodopa and 3-o-methyldopa (3omd) are in the 0.5 to 1.0 nmol/l and 4 to 10
nmol/l ranges, respectively.[9] gas chromatographymass spectroscopy (gc-ms)[10] is much more expensive and is only justified in those conditions
which necessitate absolute identification of any
of the 35 metabolites of levodopa [e.g. 3methoxytyramine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid (dopac) and homovanillic acid (hva)] in
biological tissues such as brain. [10]
as reported by rondelli et al.,[11] levodopa
methyl ester can be quantified in nanogram levels
from plasma by hplc with a coulometric detector
equipped with a dual-electrode system.

ganglia and nerves, and in epinephrine- and
norepinephrine-containing cells of the adrenal medulla. in the nigrostriatal neurons, the biotransformation of levodopa by the pyridoxine-dependent
enzyme  xxxg618xxx 
(alaad) to dopamine occurs very rapidly (figure
3). this enzyme is ubiquitous and nonspecific,
with particularly high activity in the stomach,
intestinal mucosa, liver, brain and its capillaries.[12] unlike  xxxg2276xxx , regulation
of alaad is not subjected to the intensity of
dopaminergic transmission.[13] in the adrenal
medulla and noradrenergic neurons in the central
nervous system, dopamine is converted by  xxxg608xxx  to norepinephrine.
comt is an extracellular, nonspecific enzyme
that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from
s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  to the 3-hydroxyl group
of many endogenous catechol substrates including
levodopa, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and even
accepts catechol steroids, alpha-methyldopa and apomorphine.[14] comt is widely distributed in humans, with highest activity in the mucosal layer of
the gastrointestinal tract, liver, brain and kidney.[15]
mao is a flavin-containing integral protein of
the outer mitochondrial membrane, which catalyses the oxidative deamination of neuractive and
vasoactive amines. it exists in two forms (mao-a
and -b), which differ from each other in substrate
preference, inhibitor specificity, tissue and cell distribution, and immunological properties.[16]  xxxg1357xxx  preferentially oxidises norepinephrine and indolamines and is irreversibly inactivated by
 xxxd1730xxx . in contrast, mao-b preferentially oxidises phenylethylamines and benzylamines, is irreversibly inactivated by  xxxd2850xxx  and selegiline,
and shows, in addition, an age-related increase
in its activity in different brain regions.[17]
radioligand studies reveal marked differences in
distribution and abundance of mao-a and  xxxg1358xxx  in the tissues investigated.[18] mao-a is expressed in neurons containing catecholamines and
is most abundant in certain brain areas e.g. locus
coeruleus, solitary tract nucleus, inferior olives and
numerous peripheral tissues including liver. in conclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

 xxxd2969xxx , mao-b is found in serotonin-containing
neurons and astrocytes and is most abundant in
structures such as ependyma, hippocampal formation, mammillary nuclei, posterior pituitary, pancreas and liver.
besides decarboxylation, other metabolic pathways for levodopa exist (figure 3). in the presence
of a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (pdi), levodopa is substantially inactivated by peripheral
comt, with only 5 to 10% of the administered
drug reaching the brain.[19] in view of this, the ratio
of mean plasma 3-omd to levodopa concentrations can range up to 14:1. the huge amounts of
3-omd formed are proportional to the average
daily ingestion of levodopa.[20] the metabolite, 3omd, is a large neutral amino acid with a long
half-life (15h). it crosses the blood-brain barrier
but does not bind to the dopamine receptor and has
no recognised intrinsic antiparkinsonian activity.
3-omd is taken up into monoamine neurons by a
transport system specific for alaads and competitively inhibits transport of levodopa and other
amino acids.[21] furthermore, 3-omd depletes allosteric regulation of the biopterin cofactor on activity of  xxxg2276xxx , the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine synthesis. this may perturb
the buffer action of endogenous levodopa synthesis
that stabilises the dopamine level in the brain.
the urinary metabolites of levodopa in the presence of a pdi have been quantified and indicate
that the fraction of levodopa metabolised by aromatic l-amino acid oxidase/transaminase is at
least as large as the fraction metabolised through
alaad.[22] in the csf of patients with pd, the
ratio 3-omd/hva was found to be approximately
1 : 15.[23] in contrast to dopamine, levodopa, dopac
and hva are less subject to sulphate conjugation
in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (csf). dopamine metabolites are rapidly excreted in the urine;
about 72% of a radioactively labelled dose administered as [14c]dopa to normal individuals is recovered within 24 hours.[24] dopac and hva account
for up to 50% of the administered dose.

1.3 pharmacokinetics

in modern clinical practice, levodopa is almost
invariably available in a fixed-combination formulation with a pdi, either carbidopa (1- alphamethyldopahydrazine) or benserazide [(+)-d,
l-seryl-(2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl)-hydrazine].
levodopa/carbidopa is formulated at the dose ratio of 10:1 or 4:1 (on a weight basis), and levodopa/benserazide at the dose ratio of 4:1 (weight
basis). both in animals and man, benserazide is
about 10 times more potent than carbidopa as a
pdi.[25] neither benserazide nor carbidopa, at
usual dosages, cross the blood-brain barrier. increasing the ratio of carbidopa to levodopa from
10:1 to 5:1 improves the tolerance to the adverse
effects of levodopa.[26] furthermore, the pdi increases the absorption of levodopa, as suggested
by: (i) the increase in peak serum concentration
(cmax); (ii) the decrease in the time to peak serum
concentration (tmax) [table i]; and (iii) the increase
(+21%) in the area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (auc) for levodopa, but without affecting the clinical performance.[27] the peripheral and
central pharmacokinetics of levodopa without pdi
have been extensively reviewed by cedarbaum.[27]
therefore this review will focus on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa combined with pdis.
the stomach has limited capacity for absorption
but may be an important site of decarboxylation of
levodopa. levodopa is absorbed 80 to 90% in the
proximal part of the small intestine by an active
saturable carrier system for large neutral amino
acids (e.g. histidine, phenylalanine, threonine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, valine and tryptophan).[31]
the rate of gastric emptying is the principal determinant in the disposition of levodopa. levodopa alters the pattern of gastric emptying in healthy volunteers, explaining its erratic absorption from the
gastrointestinal tract.[32] elderly patients with pd
(≥65 years) show increased auc (+28%) for levodopa after oral administration as a result of reduced
apparent oral clearance (–24%) of the drug.[33] furthermore, a higher incidence of multiple peak
plasma levodopa concentrations has been observed
in this subpopulation of patients.[34] gastric empclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

tying may be delayed by food (especially fat), resulting in a 3-fold increase in the tmax of levodopa.[35,36] levodopa should therefore be administered at least 30 minutes before meals. furthermore,
increased gastric acidity, concomitant use of antimuscarinic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants and
ferrous sulphate delay and/or reduce levodopa absorption.[36] diet rich in insoluble fibre[37] and the
benzamide derivative,  xxxd1708xxx , both seem to improve levodopa absorption and motor function.[38]
finally, exercise does not seem to have a consistent
influence on levodopa absorption.[39]
coadministration of levodopa plus carbidopa
results in an almost 2-fold increase in plasma levodopa elimination half-life (t1⁄2beta)[30,40] (table i) and
a 75% reduction in total daily levodopa dose required to produce clinical effects.[27] levodopa
disappears from the plasma by a biphasic process.
however, unlike the apparent volume of distribution, plasma levodopa clearance is significantly reduced in the presence of a pdi, [30,41] and
is age-dependent. [33] the peripheral pharmacokinetic properties of levodopa are not affected by
disease progression, indicating a predominantly
pharmacodynamic origin of motor complications.[40,41] however, the progression of the dopaminergic deficit and the short t1⁄2beta of levodopa, associated with large swings in plasma levodopa
concentrations, produced by immediate-release
preparations may be deleterious and may contrib© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ute to the occurrence of motor fluctuations.[40,42]
while insignificant in early pd, small changes in
levodopa disposition can dramatically contribute
to the therapeutic response in advanced stages of
the disease.[41]
recent studies in parkinsonian patients have revealed that oral protein loads reverse the therapeutic effect to orally,[43] intraduodenally[44] or intravenously[45] administered levodopa without reducing
the plasma levodopa concentrations. high plasma
large neutral amino acid levels result in the occurrence of parkinsonian symptoms, even in the presence of high plasma levodopa concentrations.
when these amino acids levels drop while plasma
levodopa concentrations are elevated, patients experience relief of parkinsonian symptoms. these
observations are consistent with the idea that competition occurs between large neutral amino acids
and levodopa for a common transport across the
blood-brain barrier.[21] the relatively small variation in plasma large neutral amino acids relative to
plasma levodopa indicates, however, that fluctuations in large neutral amino acids do not contribute to the fluctuating response to levodopa.[45]
dietary manipulations, including rescheduling
of protein intake or protein restriction (e.g. 0.8g of
protein/kg), can be a simple adjunct to the treatment of pd that can significantly prolong the
efficacy of levodopa therapy in certain fluctuating ‘end-stage’ patients.[46] the benefit of this

treatment is usually noted within a week of diet
initiation.
ventricular csf is a more reliable index of brain
levodopa pharmacokinetics than lumbar csf because of the lag between the rostral and caudal appearance of levodopa along the neuraxis.[47] ventricular csf pharmacokinetics of levodopa and its
metabolites have been studied in patients with advanced pd.[23,48] in these studies, csf levodopa
concentrations were 12% of those in plasma and
peak csf levodopa concentrations occurred 1 to 2
hours after peak plasma concentration of levodopa.
dopamine was found only in its sulfoconjugated
form. although plasma and csf pharmacokinetic
parameters (cmax, tmax and auc) for levodopa were
highly correlated, the time course of clinical improvement and worsening was more closely related
to the appearance and disappearance of both levodopa and dopamine sulfate in the csf. furthermore
csf levodopa concentrations correlated closely
with the onset of dyskinesia. csf 3-omd and hva
concentrations were relatively constant throughout
the administration interval and did not correlate either with plasma or csf levodopa concentrations
or with the development of clinical response or
dyskinesia.[23,49] lumbar csf monitoring revealed
that the ratio of dopamine to 3-omd was significantly shifted in favour of 3-omd in pd patients
with wearing-off compared with patients without
wearing-off.[50] in contrast, the concentrations of
levodopa, dopamine and hva were not different
between the two groups of patients. these results
suggest that even if 3-omd is related to the pathogenesis of wearing-off, it is not through competition with levodopa for uptake into the brain, but
through other unknown mechanisms within the
brain. the transient nature of the correlation between motor fluctuations, csf levodopa, and csf
dopamine sulfate observed is probably consistent
with suggestions that in patients with advanced pd
there is a diminished capacity to store dopamine
synthesised from exogenous levodopa.[48]

brain dopamine. hvain the csf may be derived from
3-omd by an alternative metabolic pathway (figure 3).
despite this, csf levels of hvacorrelate with the magnitude of response to levodopa. in levodopa-treated
patients, csf 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid and 3hydroxy-kynurenine concentrations show significant
positive correlations with levodopa doses.[51]
levodopa is also taken up into other peripheral
compartments, the largest being skeletal muscle.[52] unlike in plasma, a monoexponential decline is observed in skeletal muscle. compared
with values achieved after levodopa alone, pdi
pretreatment results in an increased (+128%) auc
in muscle and prolongs (+90%) the t1⁄2beta of levodopa
from this compartment. furthermore, carbidopa
enhances the accumulation of 3-omd and dopamine in skeletal muscle, but decreases that of
dopac. these data suggest that pdis have a
levodopa-sparing effect in skeletal muscle.
1.4 concentration-effect relationships

the degree of correlation between variations in
plasma levodopa concentrations and motor performance has been the subject of multiple reports.
four types of responses to levodopa have been
observed: the short-duration response (sdr),
long-duration response (ldr), negative response
and dyskinesias.[53] the sdr, which is measured
in minutes to hours, is positively correlated with
the pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa and is responsible for unpredictable fluctuations in motor
performance. the ldr is measured in days and is
detectable by the gradual increase in motor disability over several days following withdrawal of the
drug from parkinsonian patients treated long-term
with levodopa. the negative response is the deterioration of motor function, which can last from
minutes up to an hour and is most frequently observed as the sdr of levodopa or apomorphine disappears. finally, dyskinesias, which can present in
different forms, are a common complication of
long-term levodopa therapy. all these fluctuations
in motor performance are superimposed on a diurnal motor variation, which differs from normal circadian motor rhythms.[54] diurnal fluctuations in
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

sensitivity to levodopa or apomorphine have not
been reported.[40,54]
the sdr assessed by the response to a single
dose of levodopa is characterised by a number of
factors.[53] first, there is a plasma compartment
and central-effect compartment threshold concentration of levodopa required to obtain a clinical
response. secondly, there is a time lag between
peak plasma levodopa concentration and clinical
response, which outlasts the rise in plasma levodopa. thirdly, the magnitude of the clinical response follows a dichotomic (‘all or nothing’) response (i.e. the intensity of the motor response
cannot be further increased) after the threshold
concentration of levodopa is reached. fourthly, the
duration of the clinical response is linearly related
to the plasma concentration.
although the early stage of pd is characterised
by a flawed drug concentration-effect relationship,
disease progression reveals a close temporal relationship between the duration of motor response
and the plasma concentration of the drug.[55] the
magnitude of the clinical response is inversely related to the age of the patient but not to the duration
of the disease.[56] unlike that for dopamine agonists, the antiparkinsonian response latency for
levodopa diminishes as measures of disease severity advance.[42,55] in contrast, the duration of the
therapeutic response to levodopa, which is doseand concentration-dependent, is not influenced by
age.[41,56] dopamine agonists reduce the threshold
and shorten the time-lag between plasma levodopa
concentration and therapeutic response.[57]
disease progression is characterised by a number of pharmacodynamic changes.[58] the baseline
motor function in the absence of any drug (e0),
which correlates with disease duration, decreases
but with no decrease in the maximal therapeutic
response (emax), which means that the intrinsic activity remains preserved.[57,58] the levodopa concentration required to obtain 50% of e max (ec50)
progressively increases over the years and is at
least 2.5 times higher in fluctuating responders
compared with stable responders. a population

levodopa in patients with pd confirmed that disease severity (hoehn & yahr status) and duration
are important determinants of the pharmacodynamic parameters of levodopa.[59] this indicates
that a standard levodopa dose can maintain plasma
drug concentrations above therapeutic threshold
values for a shorter period of time in response
fluctuators; this also explains the reduced duration
of their motor response. in addition, the slope of
the levodopa dose-antiparkinsonian response
curve (hill coefficient) becomes gradually steeper
(indicating a higher degree of drug receptor occupancy required to obtain clinical response) and
shifts to the right with advancing pd (figure 4).
the latter indicates decreased potency (tolerance
to long term treatment probably due to receptor
desensitisation) of the drug for the nigrostriatal
dopaminergic system. change in the ec50 of levodopa demonstrates that alterations at the postsynaptic level are most likely responsible for this reduction in sdr.[42]
the equilibration half-life of levodopa between
plasma and effect-site concentration (t1⁄ xxxd1278xxx ), which
is considered to be a sensitive index of residual
nigrostriatal functionality and integrity, [55,57]
decreases dramatically with disease progression (t1⁄ xxxd1278xxx  was estimated at 2 to 3 hours in stable
responders and 0.4 hour in response fluctuators)
and disease severity.[60] the onset and duration of
motor response becomes shorter with disease progression.[55,61] the latter is explained by the positive correlation between t1⁄ xxxd1278xxx  and the duration of
the ‘all-or-nothing’ response. decreasing the t 1⁄ xxxd1278xxx 
shortens the duration of the motor response and
also alters the shape of the time-action curve, but
does not alter the concentration-response curve.
the reduction in levodopa t1⁄ xxxd1278xxx  values with disease
progression probably reflects changes in the nigrostriatal dopamine turnover, with loss of dopamine
storage capacity and disturbed synthesis and release mechanisms. studies indicate that during
long-term treatment with levodopa the ldr
might unfavourably influence the sdr, resulting
in reduction of both magnitude and duration of the
sdr.[62] moreover, in these conditions, no differclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

ence is observed between the sdr in patients with
mild and severe pd.
the ldr is common to most antiparkinsonian
agents and is found in mildly and severely affected
parkinsonian patients.[3] indeed, it is well known
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

that patients with early pd can be adequately controlled by pulse doses of levodopa (e.g. one dose
every other day or more). the onset of the ldr is
shortened by a faster rate of administration of levodopa. the latter does not, however, influence the
magnitude and duration of the ldr.[63] the ldr
is inversely related to disease severity and decays
more rapidly in more severely affected patients.[3]
it is estimated that the ldr contributes about 30%
to 50% of the total levodopa response in response
fluctuators. in contrast to the sdr, the ldr is the
translation of the functional ability of the central
dopaminergic system.[64]
it is postulated that the inhibitory effect of low
concentrations of striatal dopamine acting on dopamine receptors with an opposed activity, rather
than those stimulated by higher concentrations to
produce the sdr, are responsible for the negative
response.[65] this response is a characteristic feature in more advanced pd, probably because of the
prominence of the sdr, and may occur when the
plasma levodopa concentration reaches the vicinity
of emin. the strategy of administering frequent
small doses can add to the occurrence of unpredictable fluctuations in clinical response imposed
by pharmacokinetic factors.
dyskinesias are linked to the sdr: ‘off’ dystonia occur when plasma levodopa concentrations
are low and the sdr disappears; ‘peak-dose’ dystonia occurs during the sdr and ‘biphasic’ dyskinesia occurs as the sdr appears and again as it
disappears. although disease progression results in
a significant decrease in duration of motor response, duration of dyskinesias remains almost unchanged.[66] initially, the clinical response to levodopa outlasts the dyskinesia, but progressively
shortens to parallel the dyskinesia profile. the
threshold for ‘peak-dose’ dyskinesia and the sdr
is the same in parkinsonian fluctuators with dyskinesia.[66] similar to the sdr, the duration of dyskinesia is proportional to the plasma levodopa concentration and the magnitude (severity) of
dyskinesia is an ‘all or none’ response. unlike the
ec50 value for the motor effect, the ec50 for dyskinesia is not affected by disease progression.[58]
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

these data suggest that the motor and dyskinesia
effects of levodopa are mediated through two independent central pharmacological mechanisms.
1.5 long-acting preparations

since motor function in pd is critically dependent upon a constant rate of delivery of levodopa to
the striatal neurons, controlled-release levodopa/pdi preparations [levodopa/carbidopa cr4 ( xxxd2471xxx -4 ®)1 and levodopa/benserazide
hb-s (madopar hb-s®)] have proven to be excellent for controlling wearing-off, ‘early-morning’
dystonia and nocturnal akinesia. [5] however, sustained-release preparations are not effective in all
patients, and the lack of acute ‘switch-on’ response
(the so-called ‘kick-in’ phenomenon) might influence patients to return to the conventional preparations.
hb-s is transformed in the stomach to a mucoid
body, which delivers its content through a hydrated
layer by diffusion. cr-4 consists of a slowly dissolving polymeric matrix. long-term administration of cr-4 and hb-s in healthy volunteers reveals that both preparations are bioequivalent and
result in respectively, 54% and 38% decrease in
cmax of levodopa compared with conventional
levodopa preparations.[67-69] the bioavailability
decreases to about 50% to 60% when comparing
the long-acting preparations with their immediaterelease counterparts. furthermore, the increase in
tmax for both hb-s (+1.8 hours)[67] and cr-4 (+1.2
hours)[70] indicate that they both behave as true
slow-release preparations. a significant difference
was observed in fluctuation index [(cmax–
cmin)/cmean] between both controlled-release products to the advantage of cr-4. consistent with a
more potent decarboxylase inhibitory activity of
benserazide as compared with carbidopa, higher
3-omd concentrations were observed with madopar

a reduction in the average dose frequency (20 to
42% decrease) with an increase in the total daily
dosage of levodopa/pdi (+15% to +35%) compared with immediate-release levodopa/pdi.[70-72]
while ‘off’ time was significantly and consistently decreased (–44%) with sustained-release
levodopa/pdi, total ‘on’ time increased 5-fold
but at the expense of an increased incidence of
dyskinesias.[71] another clinical benefit is the
longer duration of action of each dose. the delayed
onset of clinical effect (50 to 60% increase in tmax),
particularly upon first arising in the morning, and
lack of sufficient peak effect are for many patients
unacceptable and very often lead to discontinuation of the treatment. however, this problem can
be easily rectified by adding immediate-release
levodopa as the first dose of the day together with
sustained-release levodopa.[5]
very few studies have compared the effect of
sustained-release levodopa preparations on long
term complications such as motor fluctuations and
dyskinesias. in a randomised double-blind multicentre study, a scandinavian group compared the
therapeutic effects of sustained-release madopar
hb-s® to standard levodopa/benserazide in 134
treatment-naive patients with pd over a period of
5 years.[72] no differences were observed as to the
mean daily dosage, the mean number of daily doses
or the use of bromocriptine. furthermore, no differences were observed in the incidence of motor
fluctuations or dyskinesia, which were 59 and
41%, respectively. similar findings were recently reported with the other controlled-release
formulation,  xxxd2471xxx -4®.[73] however, unlike in the levodopa/benserazide trial, only
20% of patients on immediate-release or controlled-release levodopa/carbidopa therapy experienced motor complications.
new sustained release preparations with dualrelease properties are under development and the
preliminary results look promising. the levodopa
pharmacokinetics of this dual-release formulation
(levodopa/benserazide) showed rapid absorption
(tmax 1.1 hour), followed by sustained plasma levodopa concentrations, similar to the conventional susclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

tained-release formulation.[74] following multipledose administration of the dual-release formulation,
the cmax and auc of levodopa were respectively,
90% and 40% higher compared with the conventional sustained-release formulation.
1.6 continuous administration

enteral and parenteral routes of levodopa administration have been explored and have proved
to be successful in reducing or preventing long
term motor complications. however, some degree
of tolerance develops with continuous infusion.[75]
in addition, continuous intravenous administration
of levodopa (2mg levodopa with 1mg ascorbic
acid) is impractical because of the low solubility
and poor stability of levodopa in aqueous solution
at physiological ph. sclerosis of peripheral veins
due to the acidity of the solution is one of the complications. furthermore, the more complex motor
fluctuations, such as diphasic dyskinesia and ‘onoff’ phenomenon, do not respond completely to
this type of treatment.[76] plasma levodopa concentrations providing optimal clinical response are
usually in the range between 1.5 and 8.0 mumol/l
(0.3 to 1.6 mg/l). however, plasma concentrations
higher than 10 mumol/l (2.0 mg/l) are required to
eliminate fluctuations completely.[41] despite the
maintenance of constant plasma levodopa concentrations, ‘off’ periods can be induced by meals. direct enteral infusion of levodopa in parkinsonian
patients with severe motor fluctuations has resulted
in significant functional improvement (increased
‘on’ periods, decrease in severity of dyskinesias).[77,78] the beneficial effects all seem to be related to the maintenance of stable plasma levodopa
concentrations.

troversy about the potential of levodopa to cause
toxic effects on nigrostriatal cells, thus potentiating
the progression of the disease, may be a reason to
delay initiation of levodopa treatment. indeed,
there is theoretical concern that normal metabolism
of exogenous levodopa, through mao or auto-oxidation, may increase oxidative stress by formation
of  xxxd2298xxx  and hydroxyl free radicals.[81] in pd, after loss of a substantial number of
nigral cells, those surviving cells increase their dopamine metabolism, and hence potentially increase
the risk of further degeneration (apoptosis).[81] finally, the progression of the neurodegenerative
process will gradually extend to other thalamic and
brainstem nuclei. however, there is no clinical or
experimental evidence indicating that levodopa accelerates neurodegeneration or causes permanent
impairment of cell function in a manner that would
result in irreversible adverse effects.[82] furthermore, it has been observed that the rate of deterioration is the same whether treatment is initiated
early or late in the course of the disease. moreover,
cedarbaum et al.[83] reported that the occurrence of
dyskinesias was higher in parkinsonian patients in
whom the initiation of levodopa therapy was delayed by more than 2 years following diagnosis,
compared with those in whom treatment was
started earlier. finally, early initiation of levodopa
therapy decreased the incidence of wearing-off
fluctuations in those patients who started levodopa
therapy within 3 years of the onset of pd compared
with those patients in whom levodopa was initiated
later in life.[84]
2. prodrugs of levodopa
in an effort to enhance the supply of levodopa
to the striatum, pharmacological modifications of
the levodopa molecule, for example carboxylated
esters of levodopa, have been developed (figure 1).
levodopa methyl ester is quickly and completely
hydrolysed by plasma esterases to levodopa and
methanol. to prevent the systemic accumulation of
 xxxd2154xxx  (a metabolite of methanol), patients
have to be concomitantly treated with  xxxd2146xxx  (2
mg/day).

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

intravenous infusion of levodopa methyl ester
provides plasma levodopa concentrations comparable to those during levodopa infusion, but plasma
3-omd concentrations are substantially higher
with the former.[85] the t1⁄2beta and volume of distribution of levodopa formed from the methyl ester
are considerably higher compared with values obtained after intravenous infusion of levodopa itself.
clinically, however, an intravenous bolus of levodopa methyl ester or levodopa produces the same
magnitude of clinical response. studies that compared an oral solution of levodopa methyl ester
with standard levodopa in a molar equivalent dose
showed that levodopa methyl ester produced more
rapid reversal of ‘off’-periods.[86]
levodopa ethyl ester (150 to 400mg subcutaneously or intramuscularly) might serve as rescue
therapy in parkinsonian patients with severe motor
fluctuations. the drug provides rapid and sustained elevations in plasma levodopa concentrations.[87]
3. dopamine agonists
the dopamine agonists can be divided structurally into ergoline derivatives (ergot alkaloids;
bromocriptine, pergolide,  xxxd2498xxx  and cabergoline), non-ergoline derivatives (pramipexole,
 xxxd3145xxx  and piribedil) and aporphines (apomorphine). most of these molecules have an
ethanolamine moiety incorporated within their
complex chemical structures (figure 2).
dopamine agonists are drugs acting directly to
stimulate dopamine receptors. there are at least
five distinct receptors for dopamine (d1 to d5), but
because of lack of selective agonists for each distinct receptor, they are usually classified as d1-like
(d1, d5) and d2-like (d2, d3, d4).[88] d1 receptors
are linked to adenylate cyclase and are located predominately at intrastriatal neurons. d2 receptors
are not linked to adenylate cyclase, or may even
inhibit its activity, and are located predominately
at axons of descending corticostriatal tracts. both
d1 and d2 receptors are thought to be postsynaptic.
d3 receptors are located partially pre- and postsynaptic.

277

postsynaptic  xxxg656xxx  stimulation is closely
associated with antiparkinsonian activity and presynaptic  xxxg656xxx  stimulation may have neuroprotective effects; however it is thought that optimal therapeutic response requires stimulation of
both d1 and d2 receptors.[89] indeed, the response to
a dopamine agonist on the d 2 receptors is
enhanced if d1 receptors have been stimulated previously.[89] stimulation of d1 receptors has, however, been linked to the development of dyskinesias.[90] most of the dopamine agonists
currently employed for the treatment of pd are d2
agonists with or without activity on d1 receptors.
the newer dopamine agonists  xxxd3145xxx  and
pramipexole show some selective agonistic activity at d3 receptors.[91] table iii summarises the affinity for monoamine and serotonin receptors of
various dopamine agonists.
dopamine agonists are thought to have some
distinct advantages over levodopa as agents to treat
pd. first, they do not require carrier-mediated
transport for absorption or entry into the brain and
thus are not influenced by the presence of food or
amino acids. they act directly on dopamine receptors and do not need storage in, biotransformation
by, or release from currently degenerating neurons.
dopamine agonists have long half-lives, which
should avoid the ‘off’ phenomena. they do not undergo oxidation and thus avoid the generation of
free radicals, which may be involved in neuronal
degeneration. lastly, some of the dopamine agonists are potent and lipid-soluble enough to be administered parenterally.
there has been continued interest in dopamine
agonists, either as monotherapy or as adjuvant
therapy to levodopa, particularly for their potential
to delay the occurrence of levodopa-induced late
motor adverse effects. in addition, interest in dopamine agonists has also focused on their potential
role in neuroprotection.[92] dopamine agonists
such as bromocriptine, pergolide,  xxxd3145xxx  and
pramipexole have been shown to act as free radical
scavengers against hydroxyl radicals,  xxxd2738xxx 
radicals and to have antioxidant effects.[92-94] the
latter might be exerted through stimulation of

indicate that apomorphine as well may exert

the following dose equivalents amongst dopamine agonists have been suggested: roughly
600mg of levodopa/pdi is equivalent to 30mg of
bromocriptine, 15mg of  xxxd3145xxx , 4.5mg of
pramipexole, 3mg of pergolide or 3mg of  xxxd2498xxx .
the pharmacokinetic properties of dopamine agonists are summarised in table iv.

in human plasma. [96] a reversed-phase hplc
method has also been developed for the determination and quantification of pramipexole,[109]
cabergoline[110] and piribedil.[111]
3.2 bromocriptine

bromocriptine was the first dopamine agonist to
be used worldwide as monotherapy and as add-on
therapy to levodopa in early and advanced pd. the
latter regimen employs doses of bromocriptine up
to 30 mg/day.

3.1 analytical methods
3.2.1 pharmacokinetic properties

radioimmunoassay (ria) has been successfully employed for the determination and quantification of bromocriptine and other structurally related ergolines (pergolide) in serum, with limits of
detection in the order of 170 pg/l.[98,104] other
techniques for the quantification of bromocriptine
have been reported: a mass spectrometric method
that provides an exceptionally selective and sensitive assay in the low ng/l range,[105] and a technique employing hplc.[106]
wolthers and colleagues[107] have described an
hplc assay with fluorescence detection for  xxxd2498xxx  with a detection limit of 20 ng/l in plasma. for
 xxxd3145xxx , the only quantitative assay described
has been lc-ms.[108] hplc with electrochemical
detection is the widely used method for the determination and quantification of apomorphine, with
detection limits in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 mug/l

bromocriptine is rapidly absorbed (about 28%
to 37% of the total dose) after oral administration.[98] it has a low systemic bioavailability, which
is explained by its extensive first-pass metabolism.
the drug remains detectable in the plasma up to
12 hours following discontinuation.[91] metabolites are excreted primarily (94 to 98%) in the bile
and faeces and 2 to 6% in the urine. only 3 to 6%
of the orally administered dose of bromocriptine is
excreted unchanged in the urine. none of the metabolites appear to be active. oxidation of the proline residue as part of the tricyclic peptide moiety
results in the formation of hydroxylates, which are
subjected to glucuronidation. bromocriptine enters
the brain quickly, with a half-life for uptake into
brain tissue of approximately 0.3 hours; 8% of the
drug crosses the blood-brain barrier.[112]

3.2.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

patients did not develop dyskinesias or wearing-off
failure until levodopa was added to their therapy.[115]
conflicting results have been reported with respect to the early use of bromocriptine (15 mg/day
or more) as adjunct to levodopa in delaying or preventing the onset of motor fluctuations.[116,117]
some studies, however, revealed that early use of
combined bromocriptine and levodopa decreased
the incidence of wearing-off (by 10 to 30%) and
dyskinesias (by 40%) and allowed the dose of levodopa to be reduced by up to 30% while providing
similar therapeutic response to levodopa
alone.[115,116]
lieberman and goldstein reviewed the clinical
trials of bromocriptine as adjunct to levodopa in
advanced pd.[113] across these studies, they noted
improvement in 60 to 70% of patients. furthermore, 60 to 80% of patients with motor fluctuations had improvement in ‘on’ time and reduction
in dyskinesia. in the majority of patients, the beneficial effects of bromocriptine waned after 3
years. again, these studies were characterised by a
large number of discontinuations (up to 40%) due
to adverse events.
the clinical efficacy and tolerability of bromocriptine have been compared with those of most
other dopamine agonists (pergolide,  xxxd2498xxx ,

no relationship has been discerned between the
plasma concentrations of bromocriptine and duration or magnitude of antiparkinsonian response. [113] following the intake of 12.5 to 25mg,
the initial antiparkinsonian response is observed
after 0.5 to 1.5 hours, is maximal at about 2 hours
and lasts about 4 hours.[113]
a large number of clinical trials have evaluated
bromocriptine in monotherapy or as adjunct to
levodopa in early pd. however, the results of these
trials were flawed by the limited number of patients, high discontinuation rates (20 to 50%), premature unblinding or other methodological problems. in addition, these pivotal studies are difficult
to compare with the currently used evaluation
scales. critical revaluation of these results indicated that bromocriptine had a modest antiparkinsonian efficacy, which was inferior to that of
levodopa, but treatment with bromocriptine resulted in significantly less dyskinesia and dystonia.[113,114] however, the large proportion of nonresponders (30%), high incidence of adverse
effects and loss of efficacy after 6 months limited
the use of bromocriptine monotherapy.[114,115] in
their 5-year study, hely et al. observed that less
than 10% of patients could be managed on bromocriptine alone for more than 3 years, but that these

be reported in the corresponding sections.
the major unwanted effects of bromocriptine
are dyskinesia (40%), mental changes including
hallucinations, paranoia and confusion (up to
30%), which are more severe than seen with levodopa, orthostatic hypotension (30%) and gastrointestinal disturbances, mainly nausea and vomiting
(up to 30%).[113,115,118] adverse effects seen after
long-term therapy with bromocriptine include fibrotic reactions similar to those seen with  xxxd2621xxx  and digital vasospasm, and occur in 2 to 5%
of treated patients.[119] uncommon adverse effects
of bromocriptine include increase in serum transaminase, nasal congestion, diplopia, sedation, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and cardiac arrhythmias.[118]
3.2.3 drug interactions

bromocriptine has been involved in drug interactions when administered with other agents (table
ii).[36] alcohol consumption has been reported to
increase the adverse effects of bromocriptine, possibly due to an increased sensitivity of dopamine
receptors.[120]
3.3 pergolide

pergolide is a synthetic ergoline, which derives
its therapeutic effect from agonist activity on d2
receptors.[101] it is also a partial agonist on d1 receptors and has an affinity for d3 receptors. pergolide is considered to be superior to bromocriptine
because of its pharmacokinetic parameters.
3.3.1 pharmacokinetic properties

following oral administration, approximately
55% of pergolide is absorbed.[101] the drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. pergolide partially inhibits cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 and
potently interacts with cyp2d6.[121] at least 10
inactive metabolites of pergolide have been detected in urine and faeces.[122] within 48 hours,
55% of the drug is eliminated by the urine and the
remainder by the faeces.

time to peak antiparkinsonian effect after administration is 60 to 120 minutes and lasts for several hours.[101] pergolide has been evaluated clinically as monotherapy in early pd and as adjunct to
levodopa therapy in advanced pd.
few studies, most of them non-blind trials, have
assessed the role of pergolide monotherapy in de
novo pd patients. in fact, only one multicentre,
randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of
pergolide monotherapy versus placebo has been reported (table v).[123] the pergolide group showed
a highly significant greater percentage of responders [defined as a 30% decrease in unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs) motor score
at end-point] compared with placebo. despite this,
a 6-month non-blind comparative study in de novo
pd patients revealed that pergolide monotherapy
(mean final dosage 2.8 mg/day) provided similar
symptomatic efficacy and incidence of adverse
events as levodopa (mean final dosage 435
mg/day).[124] wolters et al. treated 20 de novo patients with pergolide monotherapy (mean dosage
0.85 mg/day).[125] despite initial improvement the
benefit attributable to pergolide ultimately waned,
and at 30 months one-third of patients required
levodopa therapy.
in advanced pd, pergolide as adjunctive therapy
to levodopa has been shown to reduce motor fluctuations, and improve activities of daily living and
motor function (table v).[132] this multicentre, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study revealed in addition, that pergolide
had a significant levodopa-sparing effect. the high
rate of dyskinesia in the pergolide group was effectively controlled by reducing the levodopa/carbidopa dosage, at the end of the study resulting in
no significant difference in prevalence or severity
of dyskinesia compared with placebo recipients.
the long-term effects of pergolide as add-on to
levodopa in late-stage pd have also been evaluated. the data indicate that after a period of initial
improvement, which last for about 1 year, this beneficial effect fades slowly in many patients. only
one-fourth of patients had sustained improvement

for 2 years. across these studies, improvement of
‘on’ time seems to be consistent.[137,138] pergolide
has been recommended primarily in patients who
do not tolerate levodopa and as adjuvant therapy
when levodopa becomes less effective or gives
troublesome adverse effects. it has also been used
when patients no longer benefit from bromocriptine.[139]
several studies have compared responses to
bromocriptine and pergolide. lewitt et al.[140] reported similar responses to the two drugs. lieberman and colleagues[139] studied 25 patients who
were initially treated with bromocriptine and later
on switched to pergolide. they found that pergolide appeared to be more potent than bromocriptine
because of its greater effect (3.2 more hours of ‘on’
time per day) at a more advanced stage of the disease. goetz[141] studied 10 patients over 5 years.
the patients were maintained on bromocriptine until the efficacy waned, then switched to pergolide.
the investigators found that after 5 years on dopamine agonist all patients had improved. the peak
efficacy of the two drugs was similar, but pergolide
efficacy was longer lasting, resulting after 29
months of treatment in lower disability rates (17%
less) with pergolide compared with bromocriptine.
their third observation was that patients who failed
to respond to bromocriptine responded promptly to
pergolide. patients with advanced pd did not improve further after switching from bromocriptine
to pergolide.[142] meta-analysis of controlled studies of the adjunctive use of dopamine agonists has
shown pergolide superior to bromocriptine in reducing motor impairment and disability.[143] however insufficient evidence is available to draw any
conclusions regarding levodopa-induced motor
complications. furthermore, no significant differences between the agonists are seen in levodopa dosage reduction, discontinuations or adverse events.
the main adverse effects seen with pergolide
are dyskinesias (30%), hallucinations (10 to 20%),
gastrointestinal disturbances (10%), insomnia
(10%) and somnolence.[101] mild and transient
bradycardia and rare hepatotoxicity have been

deleu et al.

reported.[101,144] concomitant administration of
 xxxd1927xxx  may substantially improve tolerability.[123]
3.3.3 drug interactions

a severe hypotensive episode has been reported
within 4 hours of the first dose of pergolide in a
patient receiving chronic lisinopril treatment for
hypertension.[145] other interactions are summarised
in table ii.
3.4  xxxd2498xxx 

 xxxd2498xxx  acts by stimulating postsynaptic d2 receptors, with a higher affinity than bromocriptine
but similar to that of pergolide.[146] it is also a partial agonist on d1 receptors. in addition, it has a
high affinity for brainstem serotonin receptors. the
advantage of  xxxd2498xxx  is that it is highly soluble in
water or saline up to 1 mg/ml and, therefore, suitable for single intravenous bolus or ambulatory infusion pumps in conditions such as severe dyskinesias.[147] a novel approach being studied is
administration of  xxxd2498xxx  by dermal application,
which has been shown to increase the ‘on’ period.[148]
3.4.1 pharmacokinetic properties

unlike bromocriptine,  xxxd2498xxx  is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract.[100,149] both absorption and metabolism of
 xxxd2498xxx  are subject to high interindividual variability. the drug undergoes extensive and variable
first-pass hepatic metabolism. the drug exhibits a
dose-dependent first-pass effect, resulting in
higher bioavailability with increasing doses.[149]
following intravenous injection of  xxxd2498xxx , in
young and elderly healthy volunteers and parkinsonian patients, the plasma concentration declines
triphasically.[149]
the drug is almost completely cleared by the
liver, with the formation of over 15 inactive metabolites, followed by excretion in the urine.[149] the
metabolic pathway consists of mono-oxygenation
and n-de-ethylation and hydroxylation of the aromatic ring.[149] the apparent oral clearance seems
to increase (by 110%) after 2 to 4 weeks of treatclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

ment. ninety percent of metabolites are found in
the urine within 8 to 10 hours after intake of an oral
dose. only 0.05% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine in 24 hours.[100]
3.4.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

improvement of parkinsonian symptoms is observed within 5 minutes after intravenous administration of  xxxd2498xxx  (0.10 to 0.15 mg) and lasts for
up to 3 hours.[91] oral  xxxd2498xxx  has been evaluated
as monotherapy in early pd at dosages of 0.4 to 5
mg/day and also as add-on therapy to levodopa in
advanced pd.
in early pd, rinne[126] found that by 4 years less
than 20% of patients could be maintained on  xxxd2498xxx  alone (table v). despite this, in comparison
with levodopa alone, early combination therapy in
de novo pd patients significantly decreased the development of motor fluctuations while maintaining an equivalent therapeutic response. a 10-year
extension of his study confirmed these findings.[150]
 xxxd2498xxx  has been evaluated in 20 patients with
advanced pd who were no longer responding satisfactorily to levodopa, including 14 patients with
‘on-off’ phenomena (table v).[133] every patient
who completed the study improved significantly,
with a 35% decrease in total pd disability score.
five of 10 patients who received further treatment
with  xxxd2498xxx  for at least 1 year had no decline in
efficacy. in advanced pd, intravenous infusions of
 xxxd2498xxx  as add-on to levodopa can significantly reduce daily oscillations in motor performance without increase in dyskinesia.[151]
when used in combination with levodopa in patients with advanced pd,  xxxd2498xxx  is as effective in
reducing symptoms of pd (by 30% on columbia
university rating scale) and motor fluctuations
(by 70%) as bromocriptine.[152] although not significant, orthostatic hypotension was reported
much less in the  xxxd2498xxx  group (5%) compared
with bromocriptine-treated patients (21%). responses to  xxxd2498xxx  and pergolide as adjunct to
levodopa therapy were also studied in 28 patients
with advanced pd.[153] both drugs improved
symptoms and had comparable adverse reaction

283

profile; however, pergolide was more effective in
reducing oscillations.
adverse effects observed in patients treated
with oral  xxxd2498xxx  include nausea (10%), orthostatic
hypotension (5%), headache and drowsiness.[91,152]
parenteral administration of  xxxd2498xxx  is associated
with a high incidence of psychiatric adverse effects
(up to 50%), limiting its use.[154] the psychiatric
adverse effects may be due to the high affinity of
 xxxd2498xxx  for serotonin receptors.  xxxd1927xxx , a
peripherally acting dopamine antagonist, can be
used with  xxxd2498xxx  to control peripheral adverse effects.
3.4.3 drug interactions

the drug interactions for  xxxd2498xxx  appear to be
the same as those for bromocriptine (table ii).
however,  xxxd2498xxx  administered concomitantly
with  xxxd1927xxx  has resulted in paradoxical hypertensive effects and disappearance of orthostatic
hypotension. furthermore, atrial arrhythmias have
been observed during  xxxd2498xxx  infusion in patients
with advanced pd.[155]  xxxd1927xxx  apparently
blocks peripheral d2 receptors, preventing the action of  xxxd2498xxx .
3.5 apomorphine

apomorphine was the first dopamine agonist to
be tried as treatment for pd.[156] structurally it is a
derivative of the opioid morphine. it has a shortacting agonist action at d1 and d2 receptors and at
low doses it acts on presynaptic autoreceptors to
inhibit dopamine turnover.[156]
in early studies, apomorphine was given orally
and had to be administered in very large dosages
(160 to 600 mg/day) because of extensive firstpass metabolism and poor bioavailability.[157] oral
use of apomorphine was also limited by adverse
effects, especially nausea, vomiting and renal impairment.[157] because of its very high solubility in
water (up to 20 g/l), apomorphine has been found
to be suitable for parenteral use and was the first
antiparkinsonian drug to be administered subcutaneously, allowing use of doses that are not toxic to
the renal system.[158] apomorphine is used as adjunct to levodopa or as rescue therapy for severe
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

284

and levodopa-resistant ‘off’ periods during levodopa therapy. acute challenge with apomorphine
has been used to test dopaminergic responsiveness
in pd. the clinical response to apomorphine may
predict the effect of chronic levodopa therapy in
90% of pd patients.[156] tachyphylaxis and loss of
efficacy have not been observed with apomorphine
treatment. apomorphine has also been found to be
effective when administered intranasally, sublingually or rectally.[159,160]
3.5.1 pharmacokinetic properties

oral apomorphine is poorly absorbed and has a
bioavailability of less than 4%.[97] furthermore,
oral doses need to be 10 to 20 times the parenteral
dose to produce similar therapeutic response.[160]
the relative bioavailability of sublingual apomorphine decreases to 6% with the concomitant administration of  xxxd228xxx .[97] the auc is greater following sublingual administration of apomorphine
30mg than after 3mg subcutaneously, but large interindividual variations are observed.[97] the drug
is very lipophilic. plasma concentration-effect
studies following escalating doses of administered
apomorphine have revealed a therapeutic window
ranging between 28 and 56 nmol/l.
the disappearance of drug can be described by
a two-compartment model.[97] (auto)oxidation is
the main metabolic route besides glucuronidation
and sulfate conjugation, which both account for
10% of metabolic transformation. no active metabolites have been detected. total body clearance of
apomorphine exceeds the hepatic blood flow,
which suggests extrahepatic clearance. only 4% is
excreted unchanged in the urine.
3.5.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

following subcutaneous and sublingual administration of apomorphine, parkinsonian patients
with motor fluctuations respond with a latency to
effect of 5 to 20 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively.[161,162] the duration of the antiparkinsonian
action (0.5 hour in advanced pd compared with
almost 1 hour in early pd) and its efficacy half-life
after a single subcutaneous dose are inversely related to the stage of the disease.[97] this may confirm that mainly postsynaptic factors are involved.

deleu et al.

sublingual administration of a single dose provides
a longer duration of action (128 minutes). chronic
administration provides longer duration of action
(0.6 to 2.5 hours).[162]
apomorphine has been shown to be effective in
clinical trials. frankel et al.[161] studied 57 patients
for 16 months. in their studies, patients receiving
bolus apomorphine (2.2mg per injection, five injections daily) or continuous infusion, supplemented with bolus doses as necessary, had approximately 5-hour decreases in ‘off’ periods. twelve
patients continued the study for longer than 2 years.
only 7% of their patients had psychiatric reactions
during the study. the authors recommended apomorphine for patients with incapacitating ‘off’ periods unresponsive to oral therapy. additional studies have shown the beneficial effects of
apomorphine to be sustained up to 5 years.[163] in
general, apomorphine seems to be as effective as
 xxxd2498xxx  but with less risk of neuropsychiatric reactions.
the main adverse effects of apomorphine are
nausea and vomiting (up to 73% of patients), which
can be ameliorated by pretreatment with
 xxxd1927xxx . neuropsychiatric adverse effects occur with long-term use, but the incidence is lower
than with other dopamine agonists.[161] the drug
has been used in patients with severe neuropsychiatric reactions to other antiparkinsonian drugs.[164]
long term use of apomorphine can result in a significant increase (by 67%) in mean daily duration
of dyskinesia compared with placebo.[165] continuous subcutaneous infusion can cause local damage, such as subcutaneous nodules, but can be to
some extent prevented by careful attention to skin
care.
3.5.3 drug interactions

apomorphine appears to interfere with the absorption of levodopa, necessitating care in the timing of administration (table ii).[166] potentially, the
comt inhibitor  xxxd3395xxx  can increase plasma
apomorphine bioavailability by modifying its liver
catabolism.[167] whether this interaction is of any
clinical significance needs to be determined.

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

3.6 pramipexole

pramipexole is a synthetic aminobenzothiazole
derivative with selective actions on d2 receptors
and particularly with agonist activity on d3 receptors.[168] it is thought that its d3 selectivity is responsible for its activity as an antiparkinsonian
agent. it acts as an agonist on presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, decreasing the synthesis and
turnover of endogenous dopamine and thus decreasing oxidative stress.
3.6.1 pharmacokinetic properties

following oral administration, pramipexole is
readily absorbed.[168] pharmacokinetic properties
differ between men and women, with auc for each
dose level being 35 to 43% greater in women, mainly
because of a 24 to 27% lower oral clearance.
the drug undergoes minimal hepatic biotransformation and is excreted virtually unchanged in
the urine by the renal tubular secretion.[103] the
renal clearance of pramipexole accounts for approximately 80% of oral clearance.
3.6.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

the onset of action of pramipexole is observed
after 2 hours.[169] pramipexole has been assessed
clinically in patients with mild to moderate parkinsonian as monotherapy and also as add-on therapy
to levodopa in advanced pd.[170]
two large multicentre, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies assessed the efficacy of pramipexole as monotherapy in de novo pd.[127,171] the
first study, including 264 patients, was a dose-ranging
study that evaluated four doses of pramipexole (ranging from 1.5 to 6 mg/day) versus placebo. after a
6-week titration period, patients were maintained
for 4 weeks on the same dose. compared with placebo, those patients receiving pramipexole showed
20% improvement in total updrs score. results
also suggested that the treatment effects were
more pronounced in patients with worse updrs
scores at baseline. the 3mg dose group showed
the highest efficacy/tolerability ratio, with 92%
of patients completing the trial versus 98% in
placebo recipients. the study reported by shannon et al.[127] examined the efficacy of

pramipexole in 335 de novo pd patients and is
summarised in table v. recently, a large
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial compared the development of motor complications after pramipexole 0.5mg three times
daily versus levodopa/carbidopa monotherapy
(100/25mg three times daily). [172] at 94 weeks,
pramipexole monotherapy resulted in significantly
less development of motor fluctuations (28 vs 51%
in levodopa group). despite this, the mean improvement in total updrs score from baseline to
23.5 months was significantly greater in the levodopa group than in the pramipexole group (9.2 vs
4.5 points). somnolence was more common in
pramipexole-treated patients than in levodopatreated patients (32 vs 17%).
pramipexole has been evaluated in three large
multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled,
double-blind studies as adjunctive therapy in
patients with advanced pd and motor fluctuations. [131,134,173] the results of the largest and
perhaps the most important clinical trial [134] is
summarised in table v.
a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study
in advanced pd with wearing-off phenomenon
compared pramipexole (mean daily dose 3.4 mg)
with bromocriptine indirectly.[173] this 9-month
study involved 246 patients and was powered to
compare each dopamine agonist with placebo but
was not powered to show statistical differences between the pramipexole and bromocriptine groups.
according to comparison of the global clinical
assessment of efficacy between active treatment
groups, there was a trend to significance in favour
of pramipexole.
pramipexole has an adverse effect profile linked
to peripheral and central dopaminergic stimulation, amenable to tolerance through a slow titration
or the addition of  xxxd1927xxx  in sensitive patients. since the drug is a non-ergoline it does not
have the uncommon but problematic ergot-related
adverse effects of bromocriptine and pergolide.
across these studies, the following dose-related
adverse events have been reported in
pramipexole-treated patients: dyskinesia (40 to
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

286

60% vs 27 to 41% with placebo), dizziness (30 to
40% vs 21 to 32% with placebo), nausea (20 to 40%
vs 17 to 25% with placebo), orthostatic hypotension (20 to 40% vs 6 to 37% with placebo), insomnia (20 to 30% vs 13 to 22% with placebo), psychiatric reactions, especially visual hallucinations
(10 to 20% vs 2 to 13% with placebo), fatigue, headache, constipation, and somnolence.[127,131,134,171-173]
one disturbing effect of pramipexole recently
reported is the sudden onset of sleep.[174] this effect was reported in 19 cases, 14 of which were
driving at the time resulting in road traffic accidents in 9 of them. as a consequence, the manufacturers have issued a caution concerning the use of
pramipexole in patients who are driving or engaging in other activities where alertness is crucial.
3.6.3 drug interactions

pramipexole is devoid of any cyp interaction
and hence does not interfere with any drugs metabolised through that system.[121] other interactions
are described in table ii.
3.7  xxxd3145xxx 

 xxxd3145xxx , a newer dopamine agonist, is a substituted indole derivative. it has greater specificity
for the d2 family of receptors, stimulating especially d2 and d3.[175]
3.7.1 pharmacokinetic properties

in studies using 14c-labelled  xxxd3145xxx , absorption after oral administration proved to be high
(94%).[79]
unlike pramipexole,  xxxd3145xxx  is metabolised
extensively by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system (cyp1a2, cyp3a4 and cyp2d6).[121] the
n-despropyl metabolite is metabolised further to
form 7-hydroxy and carboxylic acid derivatives,
which are subsequently glucuronidated and excreted in the urine. 7-hydroxy- xxxd3145xxx  is the
only metabolite of  xxxd3145xxx  previously shown to
possess significant dopamine agonist activity in
vivo.
3.7.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

deleu et al.

of antiparkinsonian action and the time to maximum response is approximately 1 hour. the duration of the antiparkinsonian effect is about 16
hours.[176]  xxxd3145xxx  has been evaluated as monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate pd and
also as add-on therapy to levodopa in advanced pd.
one 6-month double-blind study of  xxxd3145xxx 
versus placebo in 241 de novo pd patients reported
24% improvement in updrs motor score in
 xxxd3145xxx -treated patients versus 3% improvement
in placebo recipients.[177] the mean daily dose of
 xxxd3145xxx  was 15.7 mg.  xxxd3145xxx -treated patients
required less supplementation with levodopa
(11%) than did placebo-treated controls (29%).
furthermore, 47% of  xxxd3145xxx  patients were responders compared with 20% in the placebo group.
 xxxd3145xxx  has also been compared with levodopa in a 5-year prospective randomised doubleblind parallel trial comprising 268 early pd patients (table v).[128] in this study, the primary
end-point occurrence of dyskinesia was significantly lower in the  xxxd3145xxx  group but similar to
the pramipexole/levodopa study; improvement as
assessed by updrs scores was better with levodopa. there were no differences observed with respect to adverse effects except for slightly increased
somnolence and hallucinations in the  xxxd3145xxx 
group. in those patients on  xxxd3145xxx  and requiring
levodopa rescue, a lower dosage of levodopa was
required compared with patients on levodopa alone
(427 vs 753 mg/day, respectively). withdrawal rates
were almost one-third in each group.
 xxxd3145xxx  has also shown promise as adjunct to
levodopa in advanced pd with wearing-off and
dyskinesia. a multicentre double-blind, placebocontrolled parallel, 6-month study reported on 149
parkinsonian patients (hoehn & yahr stage ii to
iv).[135] of these, 35% of the  xxxd3145xxx  and 13%
of the placebo-treated patients achieved the primary end-points, having a 20% or greater reduction
in ‘off’ time and decrease in dose of levodopa between baseline and final visit. the changes in secondary variables are summarised in table v. the
most frequently encountered adverse effects were
dyskinesias, which occurred before reduction in

levodopa. other adverse effects were similar for
 xxxd3145xxx  and placebo groups.
a further study compared the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd3145xxx  with that of bromocriptine after
3 years of treatment.[178] the study was designed
as a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study
in 335 patients with early pd requiring dopaminergic therapy. patients, treated with or without
selegiline, received either  xxxd3145xxx  or bromocriptine. in this study, patients taking  xxxd3145xxx   xxxd2531xxx 
alone showed a significant improvement in updrs
motor score of 31% compared with 22% in the
bromocriptine group (24mg) alone. serious adverse
effects were encountered in 3% of  xxxd3145xxx  patients and 6.6% of bromocriptine patients. it is
worth mentioning that almost one-third of the
 xxxd3145xxx -treated and half of the bromocriptinetreated patients withdrew from the study because
of adverse effects. the study revealed a negative
interaction between bromocriptine and selegiline
in that patients randomised to bromocriptine had a
smaller improvement in updrs motor score.
the adverse effects of  xxxd3145xxx  are similar to
those occurring with the other non-ergoline derivative, pramipexole.[176] nausea was reported in
41% of  xxxd3145xxx -treated patients compared with
25% in patients receiving bromocriptine.[178] similarly, the incidence of hallucinations (17%) was
higher with  xxxd3145xxx  compared with levodopa
(6%).[128] other reported adverse events include
dizziness, somnolence and postural hypotension.
as with other dopamine agonists,  xxxd1927xxx 
given concurrently alleviates some of the peripheral symptoms. similarly to pramipexole, sudden
irresistible attacks of sleep while driving have been
reported for  xxxd3145xxx .[174]
3.7.3 drug interactions

drugs such as ciprofloxacin, which is an inhibitor of cyp1a2, will increase  xxxd3145xxx  auc by
84% on average (table ii). estrogens will decrease
 xxxd3145xxx  clearance by about 36%.[79,121]

tors, binding to d2 and d3 with less affinity for
d1.[179] this receptor binding has been shown to be
long lasting, up to 72 hours.
3.8.1 pharmacokinetic properties

cabergoline is well absorbed after oral administration. in the dose range of 0.5 to 1.5 mg, the
pharmacokinetics of cabergoline are dose-independent.[99]
the drug undergoes extensive metabolism by
hydrolysis of the acylurea bond of the urea moiety
and is excreted in the bile and faeces. the extremely long half-life is an advantage in that the
drug needs to be administered only once daily and
should alleviate the problem of ‘off’ reactions. the
percentage of the administered dose of cabergoline
excreted in the urine is 1%.[99] its excretion seems
to be unaffected by food, age or renal or hepatic
disease.
3.8.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

cabergoline has been evaluated as monotherapy for early pd and also as add-on therapy to levodopa in advanced pd.
rinne et al. reported their findings in 412 de
novo pd patients who were randomised to receive
levodopa or cabergoline.[129] after 3 years of therapy, development of motor complications (the primary endpoint) was significantly less frequent in
patients treated with cabergoline than in levodopa
recipients (table v). although no percentages were
given for dyskinesia prevalence in those remaining
on monotherapy during the entire study, it was
stated that the relative risk of developing motor
complications during treatment with cabergoline
was more than 50% lower than with levodopa. adverse effects occurred in 31% of cabergoline
treated patients and 25% of those treated with levodopa. the wearing-off effect was the most frequently encountered motor complication. the authors concluded that beginning therapy with
cabergoline significantly delays the development
of serious motor complications.
marsden reviewed the findings of four studies
with cabergoline in patients with advanced pd
treated with levodopa.[180] compared with placebo
(two studies, including 225 patients), cabergoline
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

288

(2 to 10 mg/day) significantly decreased the amount
of ‘off’ time by 45% (vs 18%), the dose requirement for levodopa by 18% (vs 3%) and improved
updrs activities of daily living score by 23%
(vs 4%). the results of the most representative
study are summarised in table v.[136] the two remaining studies compared cabergoline with
bromocriptine and included 750 patients. cabergoline (0.5 to 6 mg/day) was at least as effective and
well tolerated as bromocriptine (5 to 40 mg/day)
with a tendency in favour of cabergoline for improvement in ‘off’ time and response rate. the once
daily administration of cabergoline also increased
the threshold for the development of dyskinesia.
the main adverse effects of cabergoline are gastrointestinal (such as nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia
and gastritis) and occur in one-third of patients.[129,136] other frequently encountered adverse effects of cabergoline include dizziness, hypotension and peripheral oedema. constrictive
pericarditis and pleuropulmonary disease are rare
complications.
3.8.3 drug interactions

in patients with de novo pd, the pharmacokinetic parameters of cabergoline are unmodified by
the adjunct of levodopa, except for tmax which is
significantly increased after levodopa (table
ii).[181] in patients with fluctuating pd, no modification of levodopa pharmacokinetics has been observed before or after cabergoline coadministration.
3.9 piribedil

piribedil is a d2/d3-selective non-ergoline dopamine agonist. in several animal models of pd,
piribedil showed significant activity against bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. recently, it was observed that long term administration of piribedil in
the mptp-treated marmoset induced a more potent
and sustained reversal of motor impairment with
less dyskinesia compared with levodopa.[182] data
indicate that unlike other dopamine agonists, in
vivo piribedil interacts with dopamine receptors in
the substantia nigra and nucleus accumbens but not
with those in the striatum.[102]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

deleu et al.

the first clinical experience with piribedil dates
back to the early 1970s. clinical interest was, however, lost because piribedil was thought to be effective mainly on parkinsonian tremor and to produce
a high incidence of peripheral adverse effects, particularly nausea which precluded long-term use in
certain patients. nevertheless, the drug was marketed in mexico, france and a few other european
countries as antiparkinsonian agent in adjunct to
levodopa and in monotherapy. recently, there has
been a renewed interest in the drug because of its
favourable therapeutic profile.[130]
3.9.1 pharmacokinetic properties

few data are available on the pharmacokinetic
properties of piribedil. piribedil has a low oral bioavailability due to an extensive first-pass metabolism. hepatic metabolism of piribedil (primarily
demethylation, p-hydroxylation, and n-oxidation)
results in several metabolites of which one, 1-(3,4dihydroxybenzyl) 4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine, is
pharmacologically active.[111] the metabolites are
excreted via the kidney. no unchanged parent compound is found in the urine.[183]
3.9.2 pharmacodynamic aspects

onset of the antiparkinsonian action is usually
observed 2 to 4 weeks after the initiation of the
therapy. piribedil has proven to be effective particularly for the treatment of tremor in pd.[184,185] recently, a 6-month randomised placebo-controlled
clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of piribedil as adjunct to levodopa in early pd (table v).[130] no direct
comparison is available between piribedil and other
dopamine agonists.
gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea,
vomiting, gastric discomfort, anorexia and constipation, are some of the most commonly encountered adverse effects. clinical trials indicated that
they were actually twice as common as in the
placebo group (44 vs 24% in placebo recipients).[130] nausea required some patients to take
piribedil concomitantly with meals or  xxxd1927xxx .[183] hepatic dysfunction, with increase in
serum alkaline phosphatase and transaminases, has
been reported. dizziness and headache are some of
the other reported adverse effects.

3.9.3 drug interactions

no data are available on the interaction profile
of this drug.
4. centrally-acting
antimuscarinic drugs
centrally-acting antimuscarinic drugs, such as
trihexyphenidyl (benzhexol), benztropine, biperiden,
orphenadrine and  xxxd3019xxx , continue to occupy
a place in the management of early pd. structurally, these compounds are analogues of atropine.
the regional distribution of muscarinic m1 and m2
receptors has been studied in the living human
brain in young and aged adult male volunteers using [n-methyl-11c]benztropine and high resolution
positron emission tomographic (pet) scan. an
age-related decline in muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding is observed in the frontal, parietal,
temporal and occipital cortices as well as the corpus striatum.[186] although the mechanism of action of this class of agents is most likely related to
blocking of the muscarinic receptors in the
striatum, a large body of data has shown that many
of these compounds function as potent inhibitors
of the presynaptic carrier-mediated dopamine
transport mechanism in which each dopamine molecule entering the nerve terminal via the carrier is
accompanied by two or more sodium ions and one
chloride ion.[187] in addition, these antiparkinsonian agents have potent agonist activity at the
noradrenergic synapse and some of them also possess n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) antagonist receptor activity, which is known to reverse akinesia
and/or potentiate the effects of levodopa in animal
models of pd. this class of drugs is useful for
treating patients with tremor-predominant pd.
 xxxd3019xxx  appears to have the most potent
nmda antagonistic activity followed by
biperiden, trihexyphenidyl and orphenadrine.[188,189] benztropine fails to show any nmda
antagonistic activity. the pharmacokinetic properties of centrally-acting antimuscarinic agents are
summarised in table vi.

4.1 trihexyphenidyl
4.1.1 analytical methods

serum concentrations of trihexyphenidyl have
been analysed using radioreceptor assay,[195] capillary gc[203] and ria.[196] the latter enables the
quantification of 7.8pg of trihexyphenidyl in
200mul of human plasma. recently, a lc-ms
method was developed with a limit of detection of
<0.1 mug/l, which is 7000 times lower than the detection limits achievable by a uv detection
method.[204]
4.1.2 pharmacokinetic properties

a summary of the main pharmacokinetic properties is given in table vi. the metabolism of
trihexyphenidyl is poorly understood. the major
metabolic pathway of trihexyphenidyl appears to
be hydroxylation of the alicyclic group. the drug
is eliminated 76% by renal excretion.[205] during
long-term treatment with trihexyphenidyl, elimination from the plasma fits a two-compartmental
model.
4.1.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

trihexyphenidyl was found in initial studies to
provide on average a 24% relief of all parkinsonian
symptoms in 76% of patients.[206] in a pet scan
study, takahashi et al.[207] evaluated motor disability and cognitive performance in de novo pd
patients prior to and after 5 to 11 weeks of
trihexyphenidyl 6 mg/day. after the end of the
treatment period, all pd patients improved on the
motor disability scale and no difference was found
with respect to their cognitive function. pet results indicated that at this stage of the disease
trihexyphenidyl inhibits the cortical cholinergic
system without affecting cognitive function.
guthrie et al.[208] performed a double-blind,
randomised study, in which indices of central
(memory, sedation) and peripheral (salivation, ratio of rr interval on electrocardiogram) muscarinic function were evaluated in 14 healthy volunteers who received trihexyphenidyl, biperiden and
placebo. trihexyphenidyl and biperiden consistently
reduced saliva production and increased the rr ratio.
in addition, trihexyphenidyl or biperiden affected

4.2 benztropine

benztropine, the most widely prescribed of the
centrally-acting antimuscarinic agents, is one of
the most potent inhibitors of presynaptic dopamine
reuptake. benztropine causes a dose-dependent inhibition of reuptake of dopamine in the nerve terminal area of the dopaminergic system.[209]
4.2.1 analytical methods

serum concentrations of benztropine in human
volunteers have been determined by selinger et al.
using hplc.[210] recently, he et al.[190] have developed a sensitive and specific ria for benztropine based on polyclonal antisera. the technique has
demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to measure
benztropine from 0.2 to 100 mug/l of human plasma
in a 200mul sample.
4.2.2 pharmacokinetic properties

few pharmacokinetic data are available for
benztropine (table vi). unlike the other centrallyacting antimuscarinic agents, benztropine is slowly

absorbed. after oral administration of benztropine,
eight phase i metabolites and four glucuronide conjugates have been identified in rat urine and
bile.[211] like most other centrally-acting antimuscarinic drugs, benztropine undergoes n-oxidation, n-dealkylation and ring hydroxylation.
4.2.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

the onset of action of benztropine is reported to
be 1 to 2 hours and a few minutes after oral administration and intramuscular injection, respectively.[27] in studies of both routes of administration, the action lasts 24 hours. the drug has a
greater sedative effect than most of the other antimuscarinic drugs. no pharmacodynamic studies
are available on this drug.
4.3 orphenadrine

orphenadrine is a diphenylmethane analogue of
diphenylhydramine with antimuscarinic, nmda
antagonistic and to a lesser extent antihistaminic
properties.[212] in our experience, the drug has a
profound beneficial effect on tremor with almost
no sedative and anticholinergic effects.
4.3.1 analytical methods

several analytical techniques have been described for the isolation and determination of alclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

kanolamine antihistamines like orphenadrine in
plasma, all of them based on gas-liquid chromatography (glc)[213] or gc-ms.[214] a more recent
technique developed by hattori et al.[215] uses seppak c18 cartridges for the isolation of the compound followed by capillary gc with surface
ionisation detection. the detection limit in the latter assay is in the range of 100 to 250 ng/l of body
fluid.

291

4.4.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

in healthy volunteers, autonomic effects (pupillary dilatation, visual near point, salivary secretion
and heart rate) are maximal within 0.3 hours of
intravenous administration and 1.3 hours of oral
administration and persist for 12 hours.[194] minor
cns effects (dizziness and sedation) are reported
15 minutes after intake and last about 1 hour. clinical data show that the antiparkinsonian effect
wears off after 3 to 5 hours.[27]

4.3.2 pharmacokinetic properties

absorption is slow after oral ingestion of the
drug (table vi).[193] the drug is metabolised via
n-demethylation, deamination and conjugation.[216] it has been found that orphenadrine decreases  xxxg583xxx  and cyp2d6 marker activity in
human liver microsomes by up to 45 to 57% and
80 to 90%, respectively.[217] furthermore the drug
also decreases to a lesser extent cyp1a2,
 xxxg582xxx , cyp3a4, and cyp2c19 marker activities. sixty percent of the drug is excreted through
the kidneys within 72 hours, only 8% as unmetabolised drug.
4.3.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

no clinical studies are available on the efficacy
of this drug.
4.4  xxxd3019xxx 
4.4.1 analytical methods

serum concentrations of  xxxd3019xxx  have
been assayed using glc[218] and capillary gc with
flame thermionic detection.[203] the latter technique provides the advantage of a high sensitivity
(50 to 100 ng/l). more recently, other techniques
have been developed including microbore
hplc.[219]
4.4.2 pharmacokinetic properties

whiteman et al.[194] studied the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3019xxx  10 mg after oral and intravenous administration to six healthy volunteers (table vi). as with trihexyphenidyl, the metabolism
of  xxxd3019xxx  is poorly understood. the major
metabolic pathway of  xxxd3019xxx  appears to be
hydroxylation of the alicyclic group.[220]

4.5 biperiden

biperiden can be given orally or by intravenous
injection. besides oral administration, 2.5 to 5mg
can be given by intramuscular or slow intravenous
injection up to three times daily.
4.5.1 analytical methods

gc[221] and radioreceptor assay[222] have been
used for the isolation and determination of
biperiden in human plasma. for both techniques,
the lower limits of detection in plasma are about
200 to 250 ng/l.
4.5.2 pharmacokinetic properties

biperiden as a slow-release formulation shows
much slower absorption than the immediate-release tablet; with the slow-release formulation a
first peak is seen approximately 4.5 hours after ingestion.[223] in all recipients a peak of about 1.0
mug/l is reached after 10 to 12 hours (table vi).
plasma concentrations for the slow-release formulation at 24 hours are around 0.5 mug/l, about
twice as high as those for the immediate-release
formulation.[191,223]
biperiden is metabolised by the liver; less than
1% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.
the disappearance of biperiden from the plasma is
biexponential.[192] biperiden is metabolised through
n-oxidation and n-dealkylation of the aliphatic tertiary amine moiety.
4.5.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

a recent pet scan study in healthy volunteers
revealed that muscarinic receptor occupancy by
biperiden was 10 to 45% in the frontal cortex at 3
hours after oral administration of 4mg of the drug.
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

292

in addition, the occupancy correlated well with the
plasma concentration of biperiden in a curvilinear
manner.[224] near-point accommodation, pupil size
and the secretion of saliva proved to be less affected by the slow-release formulation than by the
immediate-release tablet, or not affected at all.[223]
these manifestations were apparent between 2 and
7 hours and reached their maximum at 5 hours after
intake of the tablet.
one study indicated that biperiden was effective
in the reduction of tremor but was not able to suppress sebum secretion in pd patients.[225] an increase of sebum excretion rate is frequently observed in patients with parkinson’s disease. some
authors attribute it to the hyperactivity of the parasympathetic system and hence antimuscarinic
drugs could have a beneficial effect on it. however,
this was not demonstrated in this study. an acute
single-dose comparative study between subcutaneous apomorphine and intravenous biperiden
5mg revealed that both drugs were effective in
reducing tremor. however, unlike apomorphine,
biperiden had no effect on akinesia and rigidity.[226]
4.6 drug interactions

potentiation of anticholinergic activity leading
to central or peripheral adverse effects or toxicity
are summarised in table ii. the effects of
trihexyphenidyl 5mg on the absorption and pharmacokinetics of orally administered levodopa/carbidopa were studied in healthy volunteers. [227] after trihexyphenidyl administration, all volunteers
showed multiple plasma levodopa peaks.
trihexyphenidyl administration caused a 43% decrease in the cmax of the initial peak and a 22%
increase in the cmax of the second peak, but did not
affect the total auc of levodopa. trihexyphenidyl
reduced the initial phase of gastric emptying after
a dose of levodopa, resulting in a decrease in the
initial peak and a greater proportion of the dose
being absorbed subsequently following the second
phase (1 hour later) of gastric emptying. these
pharmacokinetic alterations could theoretically be
beneficial in advanced pd. similarly, chronic in© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

deleu et al.

take of orphenadrine led to a less predictable pattern of levodopa absorption.[228]
5. amantadine
amantadine is a synthetic tricyclic amine that
belongs to the class of aminoadamantanes (figure
1). originally introduced as prophylaxis for influenza a, the drug was later found to have an antiparkinsonian action.[229] in practice, the drug is
used in monotherapy or as add-on to levodopa/pdi
or dopamine receptor agonists in early and advanced pd.
the mechanism of action of amantadine is probably related to the enhancement of dopaminergic
transmission in addition to its mild antimuscarinic
activity.[230] furthermore, at ‘therapeutic’ (low micromolar) concentrations, amantadine inhibits,
in a noncompetitive way, the nmda receptormediated stimulation of acetylcholine release
from rat neostriatum in vitro. [231] this indicates
that, similar to centrally-acting antimuscarinic
drugs, the beneficial effects of amantadine may
be mediated, in part, by its neuroprotective nmda
antagonistic properties. there is some evidence that
the antiparkinsonian effect of amantadine may also
be mediated in part by stimulation of cerebral dopa
decarboxylase activity.[232] derivatives of amantadine such as memantine and rimantadine are currently under investigation for their antiparkinsonian potential. data look encouraging but warrant
further investigation.
5.1 analytical methods

zhou et al.[233] described a simple, highly sensitive and selective method for the determination of
amantadine in plasma and urine by using hplc
with fluorescence detection. the method involves
simultaneous extraction and derivatisation of biological fluids with a 9-fluoreneacetate solid-phase
derivatisation reagent.
5.2 pharmacokinetic properties

in healthy elderly volunteers, absorption of oral
amantadine is slow and variable (table i).[28] in
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

both healthy volunteers and parkinsonian patients,
steady-state plasma concentrations are usually
reached within 4 to 7 days.[28] pharmacokinetic
data indicate that the drug is extensively bound to
tissues, little drug being found in the circulation.[28] over the therapeutic range investigated, its
apparent volume of distribution is inversely related
to dose and accounts in part for a noteworthy dosedependent logarithmic increase in plasma concentration. administration schedules resulting in
plasma amantadine concentrations below 1 to 1.5
mg/l have been advised to prevent potential toxicity.[29] amantadine is only metabolised to a small
extent: 5 to 15% is metabolised by acetylation.[28]
the drug is almost entirely (90%) eliminated by
renal clearance, particularly renal tubular secretion. in view of this, dosage reduction is advised in
the elderly and patients with renal dysfunction to
avoid toxicity.
5.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

the onset of the antiparkinsonian effect is observed within 48 hours of the initiation of therapy.
some studies indicate a decline in efficacy after a few
months;[234] yet other studies reveal long-lasting
beneficial effect.[235,236] the drug seems to be more
effective than antimuscarinic drugs but less effective
than levodopa.[237,238] in monotherapy, two-thirds
of parkinsonian patients react with a global improvement of 20 to 40%.[236] no significant correlation has been found between plasma concentrations of amantadine (0.5 to 1.0 mg/l) and therapeutic
effects.[28]
a few double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
involving a small number of patients have demonstrated the potential of amantadine to reduce
levodopa-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations in patients with advanced pd.[239,240] these
studies indicated that amantadine reduces dyskinesia by about 50%, without affecting the magnitude of the motor response to oral levodopa or daily
‘off’ time. no tolerance develops to this antidyskinetic effect.[240]
the adverse effects of amantadine are usually
mild and transient, and include livedo reticularis,
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

293

ankle oedema, confusion, nightmares and peripheral antimuscarinic effects.[230] however, longterm use can result in reversible peripheral neuropathy.[241]
5.4 drug interactions

very few drug-drug interactions have been reported with amantadine and are summarised in table ii. in addition, amantadine can potentiate the
therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of anticholinergic
drugs and levodopa.
6.  xxxg487xxx 
inhibitors
when decarboxylation of levodopa is blocked
by a pdi, o-methylation becomes the most prominent pathway of levodopa catabolism and high
amounts of 3-omd accumulate.[58] however, it
seems unlikely that the accumulation of plasma 3omd contributes decisively to the pathogenesis of
motor fluctuations in pd, since no relationship has
been established between the short-term alterations or accumulation in circulating 3-omd concentrations and fluctuations in motor performance.[20] furthermore, the rate of appearance of
levodopa in the csf is not correlated with the fractional increase in csf 3-omd concentrations,[53]
which suggests that the availability of levodopa to
the brain is more affected by the rate of production
of 3-omd from levodopa in the periphery than by
competition for entry into the brain at the bloodbrain barrier. hence, the systemic pool of 3-omd
might potentially serve as an important sink for
exogenously administered levodopa, and comt
inhibitors might favourably influence levodopa
pharmacokinetics in plasma, skeletal muscle and
brain.[20,58]
comt inhibitors ( xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx )
cause potent, selective, reversible and dose-dependent inhibition of soluble comt in liver, kidney, small intestine and red blood cells.[19]  xxxd2000xxx  is a peripherally-acting comt
inhibitor, whereas  xxxd3395xxx  also inhibits omethylation in brain.[242] in vitro studies in primary
mesencephalic cultures from rats have shown that
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

comt inhibition attenuates levodopa toxicity on
dopaminergic neurons, and this is independent of
3-omd or s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx .[243]
comt inhibitors significantly prolong the antiparkinsonian response after single-dose and during
long-term levodopa administration in patients with
motor fluctuations.[244-247] additional long-term
studies are awaited to confirm the efficacy and
safety of comt inhibitors as adjuvants in the treatment of pd.
6.1 analytical methods

 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are nitrocatecholtype comt inhibitors. both compounds have been
assayed by hplc using an amperometric detector.[248]  xxxd3395xxx  in plasma has been quantified by
means of hplc with coulometric detection.[249]
detection limits for  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  in
human plasma vary between 1 and 10 mug/l. the
3-o-glucuronides of  xxxd2000xxx  and its (z)-isomer
can be quantified by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography.[250]
6.2  xxxd2000xxx 

in vitro studies on human tissue samples indicate that  xxxd2000xxx  has the highest inhibitory activity on duodenal comt and is more potent than
 xxxd3395xxx  in hepatic, duodenal, lung and kidney
tissue.[251] after a single dose of  xxxd2000xxx  200
mg, the comt activity fully recovers within 8
hours.  xxxd2000xxx  has no effect on central comt
activity.[242] however, pet scan studies in healthy
volunteers and parkinsonian patients reveal that
pretreatment with  xxxd2000xxx  200 to 800mg prior
to injection of 6-l-[18f]fluorodopa plus carbidopa
significantly increases circulating and striatal concentrations of fluorodopa compared with levodopa/pdi alone.[252]
6.2.1 pharmacokinetic properties

 xxxd2000xxx  [the (e)-isomer] is rapidly absorbed
after oral intake of a single dose (table vi). the
distribution half-life of oral  xxxd2000xxx  is in the
order of 0.3 hours.[197] higher cmax and tmax values
are observed in older patients.[198]  xxxd2000xxx  does

deleu et al.

not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence does
not achieve significant concentrations in the
brain.[19] furthermore, at therapeutic dosages,
chronic administration of  xxxd2000xxx  does not result in plasma accumulation. the combination of
levodopa/pdi with  xxxd2000xxx  does not significantly affect  xxxd2000xxx  pharmacokinetics. dosage reduction is recommended in patients with
liver impairment.
despite its catechol structure,  xxxd2000xxx  is not
a substrate for comt.  xxxd2000xxx  undergoes rapid
isomerisation in plasma and red blood cells to the
(z)-isomer which is the only phase i metabolite
found in human plasma.[253] the (z)-isomer has a
similar plasma-time profile to that of its parent
compound, but is present in low concentrations and
has no clinical comt inhibitory effect.[254] the
glucuronide conjugates of  xxxd2000xxx  and its (z)isomer are the principal metabolites and represent
about 70 and 25% of the urinary metabolites, respectively. a substantial proportion of a dose of
 xxxd2000xxx  appears to be eliminated via biliary excretion.[253] less than 10% of it is excreted unchanged in the urine over 8 hours. in healthy volunteers, the elimination of  xxxd2000xxx  after oral
administration of therapeutic doses is best described by two phases: the beta phase and gamma phase,
representing 90 and 10% of elimination, respectively.[197,198]
6.2.2 effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics
and metabolism

the comt-inhibiting actions of  xxxd2000xxx 
have profound effects on the peripheral absorption
and elimination of levodopa. in healthy volunteers[254] and parkinsonian patients,[198,199,255]
combined administration of  xxxd2000xxx  and levodopa/pdi significantly alter the auc and t1⁄2beta of
levodopa compared with levodopa/pdi alone, but
do not affect its cmax or tmax. this results in less
fluctuating concentrations of levodopa and, consequently, less peak dose toxicity in the form of dyskinesia and hallucinations.  xxxd2000xxx  increases the
auc of levodopa in a dose-dependent manner both
after acute (29 to 65% increase) and chronic (21% increase) administration of  xxxd2000xxx .[199,254,255]
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

dose-findingstudiesindicate that a single 200mg
dose of  xxxd2000xxx  is associated with optimal
pharmacokinetic effects on levodopa in parkinsonian patients with wearing-off phenomenon.[199]
despite a levodopa-sparing effect of 27%, longterm  xxxd2000xxx  treatment increases mean plasma
levodopa concentrations (+22%), interdose trough
concentrations (+29%) and interdose peak concentrations (+13%) in patients with pd.[255] a corresponding decrease in the auc of 3-omd and hva
of up to 45 to 60% and 21%, respectively, are observed during either acute or long-term administration of  xxxd2000xxx .[19] the acute or long-term coadministration of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg with
controlled-release levodopa/pdi increases significantly the auc of levodopa versus the controlled-release preparation alone in patients with pd
(by 36 and 33%, respectively).[256] repeated doses
of  xxxd2000xxx  (600 to 800 mg/day for 10 days) significantly increase the cmax of levodopa and prolong its t max to a greater extent when  xxxd2000xxx 
is given with controlled-release levodopa/pdi
than when the drug is given with immediaterelease levodopa/pdi. a population pharmacodynamic model of the dose-response study
showed that the concentration-effect curve of levodopa was not affected by  xxxd2000xxx , suggesting
that  xxxd2000xxx  acts only at the peripheral
level.[257]
6.3  xxxd3395xxx 

 xxxd3395xxx  is an inhibitor of both peripheral and
cerebral comt. pet scan studies in monkeys revealed that  xxxd3395xxx  was more effective than  xxxd2000xxx  in potentiating the effects of levodopa.[258]
6.3.1 pharmacokinetic properties

 xxxd3395xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of a single dose. the high bioavailability
of  xxxd3395xxx  and its low metabolic rate compared
with  xxxd2000xxx  explain why the former can be
administered on a three times daily basis, during
which  xxxd3395xxx  exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for doses up to 200mg.[19] population
pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the pharma© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

295

cokinetics of  xxxd3395xxx  are best described by a
two-compartment open model with first-order absorption.[200] accumulation of  xxxd3395xxx  has been
observed with doses of 400mg and greater, possibly as a result of decreased or saturated metabolic
clearance.[201] increase in unbound  xxxd3395xxx  due
to alterations in protein binding (hypoalbuminaemic state, hepatic failure, drug interactions) could
potentially result in adverse dopaminergic effects.
 xxxd3395xxx  has been quantified in csf and its concentration seems to be sufficient to inhibit comt
activity by about 75%.[259]
 xxxd3395xxx  has low first-pass metabolism. it is
almost completely metabolised in the liver before
excretion, and eliminated 60% by the kidney. patients with cirrhosis have a lower clearance and
volume of distribution than healthy individuals,
and it is therefore recommended to halve the dose
in patients with liver impairment.[260] the major
metabolite of  xxxd3395xxx  is an inactive glucuronide conjugate.  xxxd3395xxx  is itself a substrate of
comt, resulting in the formation of 3-omethyltolcapone. however plasma concentrations
of this metabolite are relatively low and only appear with supratherapeutic doses.[19] this metabolite has an t1⁄2beta of approximately 32 hours and does
not contribute to the inhibitory activity of the parent compound. another metabolite is the carboxylic acid compound produced via cyp3a4 and
 xxxg582xxx . only small amounts of the dose (0.5%)
are found unchanged in the urine (renal clearance
0.02 l/h).
6.3.2 effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics
and metabolism

similar to  xxxd2000xxx , concomitant administration of  xxxd3395xxx  and levodopa/pdi results in a
dose-dependent increase in auc of levodopa without significant change in the pharmacokinetic variables of levodopa absorption (cmax and tmax).[261]
in patients with advanced pd, a single 200mg dose
of  xxxd3395xxx  is associated with optimal pharmacokinetic effects on immediate-release levodopa.[261]
with all levodopa/carbidopa formulations,
 xxxd3395xxx  reduces the cmax and auc of 3-omd by
80 and 70%, respectively.[261] repeated doses of
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

296

 xxxd3395xxx  (200mg three times daily) result in a 6fold decrease in plasma 3-omd concentrations.[262] in clinical studies,  xxxd3395xxx  200 or
400mg increases the auc of levodopa by 32 to
81% compared with placebo.[19] after administration of  xxxd3395xxx  200mg, levodopa clearance is reduced by 38%, and its t1⁄2beta is increased by 32 to
78%. therefore, a levodopa dose reduction should
be advised during concomitant use of levodopa/pdi and  xxxd3395xxx . compared with levodopa/carbidopa treatment alone, the concomitant
administration of  xxxd3395xxx  results in significant
increase in levodopa and dopamine concentrations
and reduction in 3-omd concentration in csf.[262]
intriguingly, the clinical effects of  xxxd3395xxx  were
closely correlated with the reduction in 3-omd
concentration rather than with the increase in dopamine and levodopa concentrations in the csf.
6.4 pharmacodynamic aspects

maximal inhibition of comt for  xxxd2000xxx 
400 to 800 mg and  xxxd3395xxx  200 mg ranges from
48 to 82% and 80%, respectively, is achieved in 1
hour and is reversed within 8 hours.[197,263] the
level of comt inhibition correlates with plasma
 xxxd2000xxx  concentrations.[197,254] the clinical efficacy of comt inhibitors is observed within a few
days after initiation of the treatment.
the pharmacokinetic alterations induced by
comt inhibition result in a number of clinically
significant improvements in stable responders[264]
as well as in patients with motor fluctuations.[244,245] two large double-blind, randomised,
placebo-controlled studies evaluated the efficacy
of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg after long-term (24 weeks)
administration to patients with pd with motor fluctuations.[244,245] the results indicated that at 24
weeks the amount of awake time spent ‘on’ increased by 1.0 to 1.4 hour (5 to 15%) and ‘off’
decreased by 1.3 hours (18%) in  xxxd2000xxx  versus
placebo recipients. furthermore, the north american study indicated that the drug was more effective (‘on’ time increased by 10%) in patients with
smaller percentage ‘on’ time at baseline.[244] significant improvement (10%) with  xxxd2000xxx  com© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

deleu et al.

pared with placebo recipients was also observed in
magnitude of the levodopa effect, translated into
disability measured by the updrs activities of
daily living and motor scales.[244,245] similar results were reported for  xxxd3395xxx  100 or 200mg
three times daily, with decreases in daily ‘off’ time
varying between 2.0 and 2.3 hours (32%) with
100mg and 1.3 to 3.2 hours (19 to 48%) with
200mg,[265,266] and increase in daily ‘on’ time by
2.1 (100mg) or 2.3 hours (200mg).[265] across
these long-term studies the mean levodopa dosage
reduction for  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  was in the
order of 12% and 16 to 24%, respectively.[19] no
tachyphylaxis was observed during these long term
trials. few  xxxd3395xxx  studies have been able to
show improvement of parkinsonian symptoms and
quality of life by means of updrs.[267]
a non-blind comparative study between
 xxxd3395xxx  and bromocriptine 10mg three times
daily in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients did
not find any difference in ‘on/off’ time and motor
disability.[268] however there was a clear difference
in adverse effect profile favouring  xxxd3395xxx , and
 xxxd3395xxx  was easier and quicker to titrate compared with bromocriptine. there appeared to be no
advantage for combining comt inhibitors and
selegiline, which suggests that the efficacy of
comt inhibitors is mediated primarily through its
inhibition of peripheral comt activity and is
therefore dependent on concurrent use of exogenous levodopa.[269]
the adverse effects of comt inhibitors can be
classified into three groups: the first group is
largely related to increased dopaminergic stimulation, emergence or prolongation of dyskinesia being the most important one. since these dyskinesias
are levodopa-dependent, they can be overcome by
pre-emptive levodopa dosage reduction (by 20 to
30%) or increase in administration interval. other
adverse effects in this group include confusion,
hallucinations and psychosis in 8 to 10% of patients. the second group consists of non-dopaminergic adverse effects, including digestive symptoms (nausea, diarrhoea) in 16 to 18% of patients,
orthostatic hypotension (3%), urine discoloration
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

(yellow), and dizziness. the digestive symptoms
are relatively common, particularly with
 xxxd3395xxx .
the last, but probably the most important, group
of adverse effects includes alterations in liver function tests, which have resulted in a number of fatalities due to severe hepatotoxicity following  xxxd3395xxx 
exposure.[270] these life-threatening adverse effects
resulted in a revised labelling recommendation by
the us food and drug administration (fda) and
the manufacturer (roche) for the immediate withdrawal of treatment with  xxxd3395xxx  except for
those patients in whom the clinical benefits outweigh the risks.[271] recently, a panel of experts
reviewed the cases of  xxxd3395xxx -induced hepatotoxicity and all clinical trials on  xxxd3395xxx  and concluded that the risk of developing liver injury was
negligible with appropriate monitoring during the
first 6 months.[272] however, the drug remains suspended in canada and in most european markets.
another relative contraindication for  xxxd3395xxx  is
severe dyskinesia, since rhabdomyolysis can potentially occur. so far, hepatotoxicity has not been reported for  xxxd2000xxx .[273] since comt inhibitors are almost completely metabolised by the
liver, dosage adjustment is advocated in hepatic
impairment.
long-term administration of  xxxd2000xxx  does
not cause any clinically significant differences in
haemodynamic parameters during either rest or
exercise.[274,275] in addition, levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine remain unchanged, but
the pattern of their metabolism is altered at rest
and during exercise resulting in increased
plasma levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol
and dopac, and decreased plasma levels of 3methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol.[274,275]
with long-term use there might, however, be
another downside to the use of comt inhibitors
with added central effects such as  xxxd3395xxx . the
increase in dopamine levels through the inhibition
of central o-methylation results in an enhanced enzymatic oxidative deamination of dopamine with
the formation of dopac[276] and free oxygen radicals in neuronal and glial cells.[277] in addition to
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

297

these biochemical alterations, and as a secondary
consequence of inhibition of central o-methylation,  xxxd3395xxx  reduces the utilisation of its biological
methyl donor, s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx . there is
experimental evidence that this dose-dependent accumulation of s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  in the
striatum induces symptoms similar to those observed in pd, due to degeneration of the substantia
nigra and depletion of  xxxg2276xxx .
6.5 drug interactions

the effects of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  on the
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of levodopa
have been specifically addressed in previous sections. it is noteworthy that long-term administration of  xxxd3395xxx  200mg three times daily does not
affect the pharmacokinetics of carbidopa in parkinsonian patients treated with levodopa/carbidopa.[278] in contrast,  xxxd3395xxx  200mg three
times daily can increase plasma benserazide concentrations in parkinsonian patients, an effect
which appears to be dependent on the benserazide
dose.[279] the interaction is however of a kind that
will probably not represent any safety concern in
patients with pd treated with levodopa/benserazide. other interactions are summarised in table ii.
7. selegiline
mao-b inhibitors reduce catabolism of dopamine at the nerve terminals in the basal ganglia,
block the neuronal uptake of tyramine and inhibit
the release of norepinephrine from storage vesicles. in addition, they may have a neuroprotective
effect in pd because: (i) they have the potential to
limit the formation of highly neurotoxic hydroxyl
radicals (oh• ) derived from the enzymatic oxidation of dopamine in glial cells and neurons, causing
membrane lipid peroxidation and nigral cell death
and (ii) they inhibit the oxidation of mptp to 1methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mmp+) and prevent
the development of mptp-induced parkinsonism.[280]
selegiline and lazabemide are the two mao-b
inhibitors currently available. selegiline (n-propynylmetamphetamine) is a selective and irreversible
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

298

mao-b inhibitor; the l-isomer of the drug acts as
a suicide substrate for mao-b, the d-isomer being
25 times less active. lazabemide is a short-acting,
reversible, competitive mao-b inhibitor, which is
100-fold more selective than selegiline in inhibiting mao-b.[281] however, recent concerns about
the potential hepatotoxic effects of lazabemide
caused the manufacturer to halt the further development of the drug in pd.
clinically, selegiline can have symptomatic effects that may be explained by increased dopamine
availability or through its amphetamine metabolites. however, the precise mechanism for enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission is not clearly
understood, since mao-b in the striatum is predominantly localised in glia. evidence also exists
that selegiline possesses other properties, including trophic effects, independent of inhibition of
mao-b.[282]
since its amphetamine metabolites may have
central nervous stimulatory effects resulting in insomnia, an evening dose of selegiline is not recommended. other mao-b inhibitors, e.g. rasagiline,
which is five times more potent than selegiline in
preventing mptp-induced parkinsonism, are currently being evaluated.
7.1 analytical methods

several techniques have been developed for the
determination and quantification of selegiline and
its metabolites in human plasma. both hplc with
fluorescence detection[283] and capillary gc[284] offer sensitivity to minute quantities (0.5 mug/l).
more recently, a fluorimetric assay based on inhibition of rat brain mao-b in vitro by selegiline
extracted from human plasma has been described.[284] although very low selegiline concentrations (0.3 mug/l) can be detected by the method,
its major disadvantage is that it measures only
selegiline. other techniques, such as gc-ms,[285]
use stable isotopes as internal standards and result
in minimum quantifiable limits in the range of 0.1
to 0.3 mug/l for both selegiline and its metabolites.

7.2 pharmacokinetic properties

selegiline is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed into tissues including the brain.[202] the drug is highly lipid-soluble,
which explains its rapid penetration into the central
nervous system. selegiline is rapidly metabolised to
l-n-desmethyl-selegiline,  xxxd2589xxx  and
 xxxd163xxx , mainly in the liver by the microsomal
cyp system.[202] all three main metabolites are
found in human serum, csf, and urine, and lmethamphetamine accounts for most of the metabolite pool.  xxxd163xxx  is three to four times
less active than its d-isomer.[202] after intake of a
single oral dose of 5mg of selegiline, the cmax of
l-n-desmethyl-selegiline reaches 5-6 mug/l, of lmethamphetamine 6-7 mug/l and of  xxxd163xxx 
about 2 mug/l. the oral clearance of selegiline is
many-fold higher than liver blood flow (1.5
l/min), which indicates that extrahepatic elimination is involved. l-n-desmethyl-selegiline has an
t1⁄2beta of approximately 4 hours.[202] the other metabolites have half-lives of up to 20 hours. all metabolites are excreted mainly via urine. during a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study in healthy
volunteers receiving 10mg of selegiline once daily
for 8 days, steady state was reached by day 4 and the
auc of selegiline and l-n-desmethyl-selegiline
were increased 2.7-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively,
from day 1 to day 8.[286] however, in view of the
short t1⁄2beta of selegiline, accumulation is unlikely.
7.3 pharmacodynamic aspects

during oral treatment the peak response to
selegiline can be expected after 7 days, with mao
activity being reduced to less than 20% of the baseline value and the effect lasting for 1 to 3 days.[202]
in human brain, the half-life of recovery of  xxxg1358xxx  synthesis after selegiline withdrawal is approximately 40 days.[287] data seem to indicate that only
about 20% of central nervous system mao activity
is inhibited by selegiline, which might provide an
explanation of why the neuroprotective hypothesis
is questionable.
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

selegiline 5mg twice daily itself has a mild, albeit transient, beneficial antiparkinsonian effect
with 10% improvement of disability.[288] furthermore, in combination with levodopa/pdi, selegiline 5mg twice daily ameliorates the wearing-off
effect associated with prolonged levodopa therapy
in 50 to 70% of patients and allows for a 20 to 30%
reduction in the daily levodopa dose.[289-291]
the hypothesis that selegiline may have a beneficial effect on the natural course of pd was tested
in five prospective studies in de novo pd patients
who were not receiving levodopa/pdi.[288,292,293]
in all five studies, selegiline slowed the rate of
symptom development after 6 months and delayed
the need for levodopa/pdi by almost 50%. however this initial beneficial effect was not sustained[294] and the drug did not prevent the development of levodopa-related motor complications.[295]
furthermore, during re-evaluation of one of these
trials [the deprenyl and tocopherol antioxidative
therapy of parkinsonism (datatop) study], it
was concluded that this beneficial effect was symptomatic rather than protective.[296] indeed, although less biologically active than their d-isomers, the amphetamine metabolites might exert
some central acting stimulatory and antidepressant effects which may have contributed to some
of the symptomatic improvement. there are, nonetheless, indications that selegiline may influence
the rate of progression of the signs and symptoms
of pd through other than a symptomatic mechanism. a retrospective postmortem study demonstrated a greater preservation of dopaminergic neurons in selegiline-treated patients than in those not
treated with the drug.[297] furthermore, a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 101 untreated patients with mild pd
revealed that selegiline attenuated deterioration in
patients with early pd.[291] recent studies have
contradicted concerns about increased mortality in
pd patients treated with levodopa plus selegiline
compared with those treated with levodopa
alone.[298,299]
adverse effects with selegiline include nausea,
insomnia and hallucinations. when used concom© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

itantly with levodopa, it may exacerbate levodopainduced dyskinesias.
7.4 drug interactions

drug interactions of selegiline are summarised
in table ii. selegiline does not affect any of the
pharmacokinetic parameters of levodopa and does
not significantly alter the distribution or elimination of levodopa from plasma. at the recommended dosage (10 mg/day or less), selegiline selectively blocks mao-b and hence does not carry
dietary restrictions. at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/day
or higher, selegiline loses its selectivity and inhibits both mao-a and mao-b. inhibition of  xxxg1357xxx  in the gut wall then results in excessive absorption of tyramine, which can exacerbate the indirect
pressor effects of this dietary amine (‘cheese effect’). concomitant intake of food and selegiline
results in at least a 3-fold increase in the cmax and
auc of selegiline.[202]
in general, it is recommended to consider
bupropion, tricyclic antidepressants and trazodone
as choices in combination with selegiline, although
tricyclic antidepressants and trazodone may be reserved as second-line treatments. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine are used frequently for
treatment of depression in patients with pd. their
activating rather than sedating action is sometimes
highly desirable in patients with pd but has raised
some concern about worsening of parkinsonian
symptoms after fluoxetine treatment.[80] the interaction might be due to an inhibitory action of
fluoxetine on hepatic selegiline demethylation, resulting in higher concentrations of selegiline and
hence loss of mao-b specificity.
based upon a critical review of the literature,
morphine appears to be the narcotic analgesic of
choice in patients receiving mao-b inhibitors and
requiring emergency or elective surgery.[300]
8. conclusion
the armamentarium of antiparkinsonian drugs
keeps on growing. two new classes of antiparkinsonian drugs have been added to the formuclin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

300

lary over the last 15 years. despite concerns about
levodopa treatment accelerating the appearance
and increasing the amount of late motor complications, adding to the controversy about its neurotoxicity, levodopa in combination with a pdi remains
the most effective symptomatic agent in the management of functional disability in pd. the study
of the concentration-effect relationship of levodopa has therefore received considerable attention
over the past years, and such studies may help to
unravel the underlying pathophysiological process
governing the different levodopa-induced toxic responses as the disease progresses. furthermore,
these levodopa concentration-effect studies provide an estimate of disease severity and affect decisions regarding the different therapeutic options,
for example introduction of controlled-release formulations of levodopa/pdi or levodopa esters.
dopamine agonists are a heterogeneous class of
agents that increase the basal tone of the striatum.
the pharmacokinetic properties of ergot-derived
dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, pergolide,
 xxxd2498xxx  and cabergoline) vary substantially amongst
each other. despite this, their clinical effects and
adverse effects are broadly similar. for many of
these ergoline derivatives (bromocriptine, pergolide), data supporting their use as monotherapy in
de novo pd patients is limited and not conclusive.
subcutaneous apomorphine is largely reserved for
patients with intractable ‘off’ periods with levodopa. both  xxxd3145xxx  and pramipexole (nonergoline agonists) have similar pharmacokinetic
properties. their clinical efficacy is significantly
better than that of the ergot-derived dopamine agonists. as monotherapy in early pd, non-ergoline
dopamine agonists (pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx )
delay the need for levodopa therapy and are associated with a slower rate of developing dopaminergic motor complications. despite this, levodopa
is more potent in ameliorating pd disability (and
hence provides a better quality of life) and maintains its effectiveness much longer than any dopamine agonist. a potential neuroprotective effect for
most dopamine agonists has been postulated
through a variety of mechanisms. in combination

deleu et al.

with levodopa, dopamine agonists may potentiate
the dopaminergic adverse effects of levodopa and
may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesias, which can be controlled and reduced by lowering the levodopa dose. although well-tolerated
and devoid of ergot-specific adverse effects, nonergoline dopamine agonists have been associated
with sudden sleep attacks while driving. all these
factors need to be taken into consideration and may
affect decisions regarding therapeutic strategies
such as early or late initiation of levodopa and/or
dopamine agonists. therefore early combination
therapy with low dosage levodopa and dopamine
agonist may be justified. since the risk of developing levodopa-induced motor fluctuations is highest
in young-onset pd, in those patients dopamine agonists should be seriously considered as first-line
agents.
pharmacokinetic data on centrally-acting antimuscarinic drugs are scanty and mostly refer to
healthy young volunteers and are possibly misleading when transferred to an (elderly) parkinsonian
population. the few pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data available on centrally-acting antimuscarinic drugs indicate that this class of agents
has a very poor therapeutic index, with low efficacy and high toxicity. hence these agents are not
advocated as first-line drugs in elderly patients.
furthermore, the lack of pharmacokinetic information on these drugs with repeated administration to
steady-state emphasises the empirical nature of
their use in pd. in view of their efficacy on tremor,
they can be useful first-line agents in patients with
mild symptoms where tremor predominates.
the pharmacokinetics of amantadine have been
well documented. amantadine has a place as an
add-on drug to levodopa in the treatment of pd,
especially when bradykinesia is a problem. the renewed interest in this old drug comes from its potential to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
by increasing the bioavailability and prolonging the plasma t1⁄2beta of levodopa as well as by reducing the sizeable pool of 3-omd, comt inhibitors
( xxxd3395xxx  and  xxxd2000xxx ) combined with levodopa/pdi proved to be an asset to the therapy of
clin pharmacokinet 2002; 41 (4)

drugs used in parkinson’s disease

pd. pharmacokinetic differences between the two
inhibitors result in distinct dosage regimens:  xxxd2000xxx  must be given with every dose of levodopa while  xxxd3395xxx  can be given on a three times
daily basis. at comparable dosages,  xxxd3395xxx 
seems to be more potent than  xxxd2000xxx . in addition to their levodopa-sparing effect they extend
the duration of action of levodopa, prolong ‘on’
time and reduce ‘off’ time, and have a beneficial
effect on motor function compared with patients
not taking comt inhibitors. although not innovative, comt inhibitors are useful as an adjunct to
levodopa/pdi in those patients with moderate to
severe pd who cannot be stabilised on other combinations. besides dopaminergic adverse effects
(predominantly dyskinesias), which can be
avoided by reducing the levodopa dosage, hepatotoxicity has been of considerable concern, particularly for  xxxd3395xxx .
the antiparkinsonian effect of selegiline is
modest and transitory. long-term studies in early
pd indicate that the drug causes a mild delay in the
need for levodopa. these observations challenge
the real therapeutic value of selegiline. furthermore, there is still the controversy about the neuroprotective effect of the drug. recent data have
rebutted the claim that addition of selegiline to
levodopa treatment resulted in higher mortality.
despite the introduction of several new drugs to
the antiparkinsonian armamentarium, no single
best treatment exists to treat an individual patient
with pd. treatment should be individually tailored
considering the patient’s age, cognitive status, predominant symptoms and severity of impairment in
activities of daily living. undoubtedly, several
neurosurgical procedures (e.g. fetal cell transplantation, posteroventral pallidotomy and deep brain
stimulation) will gain ground and perhaps join the
therapeutic arena in this new millennium.
sleep attacks or excessive daytime sleepiness
often resulting in motor vehicle accidents have
been reported in patients treated with dopamine
agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline,  xxxd2498xxx , pergolide, piribedil,  xxxd3145xxx  and pramipexole) and
levodopa.[301,302] a recently performed meta-anal© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

301

ysis of randomised controlled trials[303] indicated
that pd patients receiving pramipexole or
 xxxd3145xxx  are at higher risk of experiencing somnolence and sleep attacks than patients taking placebo or levodopa alone. predictor risk factors are
increasing age, advanced disease and high-dose regimens.
