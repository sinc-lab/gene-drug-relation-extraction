participation of leukotriene c(4) in the regulation of suicidal erythrocyte death.  eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes, is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure at the erythrocyte surface. eryptosis is triggered by increase in cytosolic ca(2+) concentration upon energy depletion. the present study explored the involvement of leukotrienes. western blotting was employed to detect the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor  xxxg599xxx , competitive immune assay to determine leukotriene release from erythrocytes, fluo3 fluorescence to estimate cytosolic ca(2+) concentration, forward scatter to analyse cell volume and  xxxg166xxx -binding to disclose phosphatidylserine exposure. as a result, erythrocytes expressed the leukotriene receptor  xxxg599xxx . glucose depletion (24 hours) significantly increased the formation of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes c(4)/d(4)/e(4). leukotriene c(4) (10 nm) increased ca(2+) entry, decreased forward scatter, activated caspases 3 and 8, and stimulated  xxxg166xxx -binding. glucose depletion similarly increased  xxxg166xxx -binding, an effect significantly blunted in the presence of the leukotriene receptor antagonist  xxxd1702xxx  (1 microm) or the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor bw b70c (1 microm). in conclusion, upon energy depletion erythrocytes form leukotrienes, which in turn activate cation channels, leading to ca(2+) entry, cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling. cysteinyl-leukotrienes thus participate in the signaling of eryptosis during energy depletion.
