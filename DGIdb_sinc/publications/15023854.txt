1 atp-sensitive k þ channels (katp channels) are composed of pore-forming subunits (kir6.x) and
of regulatory subunits, the sulphonylurea receptors (surx). synthetic openers of katp channels form
a chemically heterogeneous class of compounds that are of interest in several therapeutic areas. we
have investigated the interaction of a novel dihydropyridine opener, a-312110 ((9r)-9-(4-fluoro-3iodophenyl)-2,3,5,9-tetrahydro-4h-pyrano[3,4-b]thieno [2,3-e]pyridin-8(7h)-one-1,1-dioxide), with
surs and kir6/sur channels in comparison to the cyanoguanidine opener p1075.
2 in the presence of 1 mm mgatp, a-312110 bound to sur2a (the sur in cardiac and skeletal
muscle) and to sur2b (smooth muscle) with ki values of 14 and 18 nm; the corresponding values for
p1075 were 16 and 9 nm, respectively. decreasing the mgatp concentration reduced the affinity of
a312110 binding to sur2a significantly more than that to sur2b; for p1075, the converse was true.
at  xxxg19xxx  (pancreatic b-cell), both openers showed little binding up to 100 mm.
3 in the presence of mgatp, both openers inhibited [3h] xxxd2215xxx  binding to the  xxxg20xxx 
subtypes in a biphasic manner. in the absence of mgatp, the high-affinity component of the
inhibition curves was absent.
4 in inside-out patches, the two openers activated the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b channels
with similar potency (b50 nm). both were almost 2  more efficacious in opening the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b
than the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channel.
5 the results show that the novel dihydropyridine a-312110 is a potent  xxxg1253xxx  opener with
binding and channel-opening properties similar to those of p1075.

introduction
atp-sensitive k þ (katp) channels are composed of poreforming subunits (kir6.x) and of sulphonylurea receptors
(surx), which serve as regulatory subunits (aguilar-bryan
et al., 1995; sakura et al., 1995). katp channels have a
tetradimeric architecture, (kir6.x)4(surx)4 (clement iv et al.,
1997; shyng & nichols, 1997). kir6.x and surx each are
encoded by two genes, giving rise to different subtypes.
additional complexity arises from alternative splicing of the
sur genes (hambrock et al. (2002b) and references therein).
a prominent example for this is given by the  xxxg20xxx  isoforms,
sur2a and sur2b, which differ in the use of the last exon
(inagaki et al., 1996; isomoto et al., 1996). different kir 6.x
and surx subtypes combine to form the katp channels in the

various tissues; the resulting channels differ in their pharmacological and biophysical properties (review: babenko et al.,
1998; gonoi & seino, 2000; seino & miki, 2003).
katp channels are gated by nucleotides; in particular,  xxxg1250xxx 
containing katp channels are closed by atp and opened by
mgadp. hence, these channels link the metabolic state of the
cell to membrane potential and cellular excitability (ashcroft
& ashcroft, 1990; seino & miki, 2003). in the pancreatic
b-cell,  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  channels close when plasma glucose
increases and thereby couple the early phase of insulin
secretion to the plasma glucose level (cook & hales, 1984;
seghers et al., 2000; seino & miki, 2003). in glucose-responsive
neurons in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the
channels close when glucose increases (ashford et al., 1990)
and affect glucose homeostasis (liss & roeper, 2001). in some
vascular beds, kir6.1/sur2b channels are activated by
camp-dependent phosphorylation and contribute to the

h. felsch et al

control vascular tone (quayle et al., 1997). in the urinary
bladder and other smooth muscle, opening of kir6.x/sur2b
channels exerts a spasmolytic effect (coghlan et al., 2001). in
neurons (mostly  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ) and in skeletal and cardiac
myocytes ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a), katp channels open in response to
ischaemia and hypoxia and help to preserve organ function
(fujita & kurachi, 2000; seino & miki, 2003).
the important role of katp channels in various tissues
makes these channels an attractive drug target, and, according
to the medical need, either opening or closing of the channel
may be required (lawson, 1996; coghlan et al., 2001). the best
known  xxxg1253xxx  modulators are the antidiabetic sulphonylureas and glinides that promote insulin secretion by binding to
 xxxg19xxx  and closing the channel in the pancreatic b-cell (sturgess
et al., 1985; proks et al., 2002; gribble & reimann, 2003).
 xxxg1253xxx  openers (kcos) also bind to sur and
activate the channel closed by atp. kcos generally prefer
kir6.1 sur2b, thereby inducing vasodilatation and hypotension as the predominant effects (lawson, 1996; quast,
1996). they belong to several chemically distinct families
including benzopyrans, cyanoguanidines, thioformamides and
dihydropyridines (edwards & weston, 1990; coghlan et al.,
2001).
very recently, the synthesis of a dihydropyridine, a-312110,
was reported, which has almost no affinity (4100 mm) for
l-type ca2 þ channels and which relaxes electrically stimulated
bladder strips from guinea-pig with ec50 ¼ 18.5 nm (davistaber et al., 2003). a-312110 carries an iodine and, after
radioiodination, was shown to specifically bind to katp
channels in membranes from guinea-pig heart and bladder,
with kd values of 5.8 and 4.9 nm, respectively. the high
affinity and high specific activity (2000 ci mmol1) make
[125i]a-312110 a very valuable addition to the other wellcharacterised radiolabelled openers, which are both tritiated,
for example, the cyanoguanidine [3h] p1075 (bray & quast,
1992; manley et al., 1993) and the benzopyran [3h]217-774
(manley et al., 2001). it was the aim of this study to compare
the binding and the channel-opening properties of a-312110 to
those of the standard cyanoguanidine opener p1075 in human
embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells expressing recombinant
surx and  xxxg1250xxx .

methods
cell culture and transfection
the mutant  xxxg20xxx  subtypes sur2a(y1206s) and 2b(y1206s)
were constructed from the respective murine  xxxg20xxx  clones
(sur2a: genbank d86037, and sur2b: genbank d86038;
isomoto et al., 1996), using the quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis system (stratagene, amsterdam, the netherlands) as described (hambrock et al., 2001). hek 293 cells
were cultured in minimum essential medium containing
glutamine and supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum
and 20 mg ml1  xxxd2193xxx  (hambrock et al., 1998). cells were
transfected with the mammalian expression vector pcdna 3.1
(invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) containing the coding
sequence of rat  xxxg19xxx  (genbank x97279) or the murine
 xxxg20xxx  clones mentioned above using lipofectamine and
optimem (invitrogen), and cell lines stably expressing these
proteins were generated as described (hambrock et al., 1998).

cells transiently coexpressing  xxxg20xxx  and murine  xxxg1250xxx 
(d50581; inagaki et al., 1996) were transfected with the
plasmids at a molar ratio of 1 : 1. in cotransfections prepared
for electrophysiological experiments, the pegfp-c1 vector
(clontech, palo alto, ca, u.s.a.), encoding for green
fluorescent protein, was added for identification of transfected
cells. at 2–4 days after transfection, cells were used for binding
studies and electrophysiological experiments.

membrane preparation and radioligand-binding
competition experiments
for cells stably expressing sur alone, the antibiotic was
withdrawn from the culture medium 3 days prior to membrane
preparation. membranes were prepared as described (hambrock et al., 1998). protein concentration was determined
according to lowry et al. (1951) using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as the standard.
for radioligand-binding competition experiments in the
absence/presence of mgatp, membranes were added to an
incubation buffer containing (in mm): hepes 5; nacl 139;
kcl 5; mgcl2 0/2.2; edta 1/0 and na2atp 0/1, and
supplemented with the radioligand ([3h]p1075 b3 nm or
[3h]gbc b2.2 nm) and (unlabelled) a-312110 or p1075. in
case of 3 mm mgatp in the incubation medium, mgcl2 was
reduced to 1 mm. after equilibrium was reached (25 min for
[3h]p1075 and 15 min for [3h]gbc), incubation was stopped
by diluting 0.3 ml aliquots (in triplicate) in 8 ml of ice-cold
quench solution (50 mm tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane,
154 mm nacl, ph 7.4). the bound and free ligand were
separated by rapid filtration over whatman gf/b filters,
washed twice with quench solution and counted for [3h] in the
presence of 6 ml of scintillant (ultima gold: packard,
meriden, ct, u.s.a.). nonspecific binding (bns) of
[3h]p1075/[3h]gbc was determined in presence of 10/100 mm
p1075 (hambrock et al., 2001) and was b10/25% of total
binding.

electrophysiological experiments
the patch-clamp technique was used in the inside-out
configuration, as described by hamill et al. (1981). patch
pipettes were drawn from borosilicate glass capillaries (gc
150t, harvard apparatus, edenbridge, u.k.) and heat
polished using a horizontal microelectrode puller (zeitz,
augsburg, germany). bath and pipette were filled with a high
k þ -ringer solution containing (in mm) kcl 142; nacl 2.8;
mgcl2 1; cacl2 1; d( þ )-glucose 11; hepes 10; titrated to ph
7.4 with naoh at 221c. filled pipettes had a resistance of 1.0–
1.5 mo. after excision of the patch, the pipette was moved in
front of a pipe with a high k þ -ringer solution containing (in
mm) kcl, 143; cacl2, 1; d( þ )-glucose, 11; hepes, 10;
egta, 5, titrated to ph 7.2 with naoh at 221c. mgcl2 was
added such that [mg2 þ ]free was 0.7 mm. openers were dissolved
as described below and added to the pipe solution. patches
were clamped to 50 mv. data were recorded with an epc 9
amplifier (heka, lambrecht, germany) using the ‘pulse’
software (heka). signals were filtered at 200 hz using the
four-pole bessel filter of the epc9 amplifier and sampled with
1 khz.

[3h]p1075 competition experiments

here, a denotes the extent (amplitude) of inhibition, n ( ¼ nh)
the hill coefficient and ic50 the midpoint of the curve with
pic50 ¼ log ic50; x is the concentration of the compound
under study with px ¼ log x. if necessary, two-component
analysis was used with nh ¼ 1 and a2 ¼ 100a1.
ic50 values were converted into inhibition constants, ki, by
correcting for the presence of the radioligand, l, according to
the cheng & prusoff (1973) equation
ki ¼ ic50 ð1 þ l=kd þ1 ;

ð2þ

where kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the
radioligand. in case of homologous competition experiments,
the inhibition constant ki is identical to the kd value. the
correction was always o2.0.
the concentration dependence of channel opening was
analysed using the ascending form of the hill equation and
taking all individual data points into account.
data are shown as means7s.e.m. fits of the equations to
the data were performed according to the method of least
squares using the programme sigmaplot 6.1 (spss science,
chicago, il, u.s.a.). individual binding experiments were
analysed and the parameters averaged assuming that amplitudes and pic50 values are normally distributed (christopoulos, 1998). in the text, kd/ki values are given, followed by
the 95% confidence interval in parentheses. when the decision
for the two-sites model was not obvious and the hill
coefficient was between 0.7 and 0.85, the fits to the one- and
the two-sites model were compared by fisher’s f-test and the
‘akaike minimum information criterion’, as described in quast
& mählmann (1982). in calculations involving two mean
values with standard errors, propagation of errors was taken
into account according to bevington (1969). significance of
differences between two (normally distributed) parameters was
assessed using the two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test.

materials and solutions
[3h]p1075 (specific activity 4.5 tbq (117 ci) mmol1) was
purchased from amersham buchler (braunschweig, germany)
and [3h] xxxd2215xxx  ([3h]gbc, specific activity 1.85 tbq
(50 ci) mmol1) from perkin-elmer life sciences (bad homburg, germany). the reagents and media used for cell culture
and transfection were from invitrogen. a-312110 was synthesised as described by carroll et al. (2001). p1075 was a kind
gift from leo pharmaceuticals, ballerup, denmark. gbc was
purchased from sigma (deisenhofen, germany) and na2atp
was from roche diagnostics (mannheim, germany). katp
channel modulators were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide/
ethanol (50%/50%, v v1) to give stock solutions of 0.1 m.
these were further diluted with the same solvent or with
incubation buffer to give final solvent concentrations o0.3%.
mg2 þ -free solutions (no mg2 þ added, contaminating
mg2 þ p10 mm (forestier & vivaudou, 1993; edta ¼ 1 or
5 mm) contained p10 nm [mg2 þ ]free (hambrock et al., 1998).
british journal of pharmacology vol 141 (7)

the interaction of a-312110 with sur2a was first investigated using the tritiated cyanoguanidine opener [3h]p1075.
high-affinity binding of openers to sur requires the presence
of mgatp (schwanstecher et al., 1992; quast et al., 1993;
dickinson et al., 1997; hambrock et al., 1998; schwanstecher
et al., 1998) and experiments were first conducted in the
presence of 1 mm mgatp, a saturating nucleotide concentration. figure 1a illustrates the inhibition of [3h]p1075 binding
to sur2a by a-312110. the inhibition curve was regular
(nh ¼ 1), reached completion and gave a ki value of 14 nm
(table 1). mgatp was then reduced to 3 mm, a manoeuvre
that decreased [3h]p1075 binding to 2171% of that obtained
with 1 mm mgatp (see legend to figure 1). the a-312110
inhibition curve was shifted to the right by a factor f ¼ 2.2
(figure 1a, table 1). analogous experiments were performed
with p1075 and the results are summarised in table 1. at 1 mm
mgatp, a kd value of 16 nm was determined and this was not
affected by the reduction in mgatp (comparison of pkd
values by t-test).

the akaike criterion.
*indicates a significant difference (po0.05) between the respective parameters for a-312110 and p1075.

the interaction of a-312110 with sur2b is shown in
figure 1b and table 1. the ki values obtained in the presence
of 1 and 0.003 mm mgatp differed slightly from those
determined for sur2a. reduction of mgatp reduced again
the specific binding of the radioligand and induced a small but
still significant rightward shift of the inhibition curve (f ¼ 1.3).
this shift was significantly smaller than that observed
for binding to sur2a (f ¼ 2.2; po0.05; comparison of
log f values), whereas the opposite was true for p1075
(table 1).

binding of a-312110 and p1075 to sur subtypes:
[3h]gbc inhibition experiments
the interaction of openers with sur can also be studied using
[3h]gbc as the radioligand; this gives additional information
since openers interfere with gbc binding by allosteric
inhibition (bray & quast, 1992; schwanstecher et al., 1992;
hambrock et al., 2002a). the low affinity of the  xxxg20xxx 
subtypes for gbc (kdb25–30 nm; hambrock et al., 2001;
stau et al., unpublished results) is, however, insufficient for
high-precision binding studies with this lipophilic radioligand.
we have therefore prepared  xxxg20xxx  mutants in which tyr in
position 1206 is replaced by ser, which is the corresponding
amino acid in  xxxg19xxx . this mutation increases the affinity of
the  xxxg20xxx  subtypes for gbc by b25  (toman et al., 2000) or
b10  (hambrock et al., 2001; stau et al., unpublished
results), while decreasing the opener affinity by less than 2 
(hambrock et al., 2001; russ et al., 2003; stau et al.,
unpublished results).
figure 2a illustrates the inhibition of [3h]gbc binding to
sur2a(ys) by a-312110. in the presence of 1 mm mgatp,

the inhibition curve was strongly biphasic. the high-affinity
component comprised 69% of the total inhibition with a ki
value of 8 nm; the low-affinity component (31%) had a ki
value of 3000 nm (table 1). in the absence of mgatp (no
atp, presence of 1 mm edta), the inhibition curve was
shifted rightwards and looked essentially homogeneous with
ki ¼ 1.1 mm; however, the hill coefficient of 0.7470.05
(o1.0;po0.001) suggested slight heterogeneity of the binding
sites. the fit to a two-sites model gave two components with ki
values of 360 and 6200 nm, respectively, and was statistically
equivalent to the hill fit (see table 1 for details). inspection of
table 1 shows that similar results were obtained with p1075: in
the presence of 1 mm mgatp, the inhibition curve was
strongly biphasic; in its absence, the curve was essentially
monophasic (nh ¼ 0.8970.05o1.0; po0.05) and could not be
broken down into two components.
it was also of interest to examine whether coexpression of
sur2a(ys) with  xxxg1250xxx  affected the allosteric interactions
between [3h]gbc and a-312110 binding. in the presence of
mgatp, the a-312110 inhibition curve was again biphasic
(table 1). coexpression shifted the high-affinity component
from 8 to 30 nm, whereas the low-affinity component and the
ratio of the amplitudes remained unchanged. in the absence of
mgatp, the a-312110 inhibition curve was now strictly
monophasic (nh ¼ 1.0 compared to 0.74 with sur2a(ys)
expressed alone) with a kd of 1.5 mm. this value was similar to
that found when the inhibition curve for sur2a(ys) alone
was analysed with a one-component hill model (table 1).
hence, both in the presence and absence of mgatp,
coexpression with  xxxg1250xxx  reduced the heterogeneity in the
interaction of a-312110 with sur2a(ys), apparent in the
[3h]gbc-binding studies.

figure 2 inhibition of [3h]gbc binding to  xxxg20xxx (ys) by
a-312110 in the presence of 1 and 0 mm mgatp. (a) sur2a(ys),
(b) sur2b(ys). data are means from four experiments and are
presented as % bs. at the [3h]gbc concentration of 2.2 nm, bs in
the absence of mgatp was 20478 and 370715 fmol mg–1 for
mutant sur2a and sur2b, respectively; mgatp (1 mm) reduced
bs to 6774/5773 for mutant sur2a/2b, respectively, without
affecting kd (hambrock et al., 2002a). for parameters, see table 1.

the analogous experiments using sur2b(ys) are shown in
figure 2b and the results are summarised in table 1. as with
sur2a(ys), the a-312110 and p1075 inhibition curves were
biphasic in the presence of 1 mm mgatp; in the absence of
mgatp, they were strictly monophasic. the respective ki
values were similar to those determined with sur2a(ys)
(table 1). a clear difference between  xxxg20xxx  subtypes was the
amplitude ratio of the biphasic inhibition curves: for both
openers, the high-affinity component was significantly smaller
for sur2b(ys) than for sur2a(ys).
in [3h]gbc-binding experiments using  xxxg19xxx  and in the
presence of mgatp, a-312110 did not show a significant
interaction with  xxxg19xxx ; p1075 was very week.

electrophysiological experiments
the channel-opening ability of the kcos was examined in
inside-out patches from hek cells expressing  xxxg1250xxx /sur2x
channels. experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mm
mgatp to keep the channel closed. figure 3 shows a
recording of a-312110 opening the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channel.
in this experiment, a-312110 was ineffective at 0.01 mm, but
elicited currents at 0.1 and 1 mm. the currents faded slowly
british journal of pharmacology vol 141 (7)

upon washout of the drug; in the absence of mgatp, fading
was accelerated (cf. gribble et al., 2000; reimann et al., 2000).
in the course of these experiments, it was observed that
mgatp (1 mm) inhibited  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels more
strongly thankir6.2/sur2b channels (see the legend of
figure 4 for details). figure 4 illustrates the concentrationdependent activation of the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2x channels by the
openers; the parameters of the activation curves are listed in
table 2. a-312110 and p1075 were of similar potency
(b50 nm) in activating the two channels. the maximum
effects (amplitudes) obtained from the hill fit showed that at
both channels p1075 was b20–30% more efficacious than
a312110 (table 2); however, if only the data in the saturation
region were considered (figure 4), this difference was not
maintained. it is also seen that both openers were b75% more
efficacious in activating the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b than the  xxxg1250xxx /
sur2a channel (efficacy ratios of 170721 and 184712% for
a-312110 and p1075, respectively; propagation of errors taken
into account).

discussion
affinity to sur subtypes
at saturating mgatp, the [3h]p1075–a-312110 inhibition
curves for sur2a and 2b were monophasic and gave the same
ki value (b15 nm); hence, in the binding step, the new opener
showed no selectivity for one of the  xxxg20xxx  subtypes. this
conclusion agrees with davis-taber et al. (2003), who
measured [125i]a-312110 binding in membranes from guineapig heart ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a) and bladder (kir6.x/sur2b) and
obtained kd values of 5.8 and 4.9 nm, respectively. the threefold difference in the kd (ki) values from the two studies
probably reflects differences in experimental conditions (e.g.
presence or absence of an atp-regenerating system and/or
native vs recombinant system, etc.). in contrast to a-312110,
p1075 showed a slight (btwo-fold) selectivity for sur2b over
sur2a. this agrees with results obtained in the recombinant

[3h]p1075, and thus reflected the true affinity of the openers
for the  xxxg20xxx  subtypes in the presence of mgatp. the ki
values of the low-affinity components agreed well with those
using [3h]gbc in the absence of mgatp. comparing the
inhibition of [3h]gbc binding to sur2b(ys) by a large
number of kcos, we recently found that cyanoguanidines,
benzopyrans and aprikalim showed this biphasic behaviour
and these openers were classified as ‘typical’ kcos; in
contrast, nicorandil, minoxidil sulphate and  xxxd1868xxx  were
monophasic (russ et al., 2003). this study shows that the
dihydropyridine a-312110 also belongs to the group of
‘typical’ kcos and that the biphasic [3h]gbc-opener inhibition curves, first observed with sur2b(ys) (hambrock et al.,
2001; hambrock et al., 2002a; russ et al., 2003), occur also
with sur2a(ys).

p1075

mgatp dependence

a312110

turning first to the [3h]p1075 experiments, we recall that highaffinity opener binding to sur requires the presence of
mgatp. binding of mgatp converts sur into a highaffinity state for openers (schwanstecher et al., 1998), in which
the sur-opener complex is stabilised by a decreased dissociation rate (gribble et al., 2000; reimann et al., 2000). sur
exhibits atpase activity and the two nucleotide-binding
domains of sur are linked by positive cooperativity and act
in concert (ueda et al., 1999; bienengraeber et al., 2000).
reducing mgatp from 1 mm to 3 mm decreased the binding of
[3h]p1075 (3 nm) to sur2a and 2b by 75–80%. this loss
reflects conversion of sur to the low-affinity state for openers
due to the lack of mgatp. the fraction of sur which can still
be labelled by [3h]p1075 is in a state different from that at high
mgatp, probably due to differences in occupation of the
nucleotide-binding domains by mgatp and its hydrolysis
products. considering sur2b, we have found that in this low
mgatp state the affinity of sur for openers is generally
reduced and that for blockers like gbc and phloxin b is
increased (hambrock et al., 2000). here we found that for
sur2b reduction of mgatp gave a smaller shift for a-312110
than for p1075 (1.3 vs 2.0), whereas for sur2a the opposite
was true (2.2 vs 1.3).
use of [3h]gbc as the radioligand offers the advantage that
opener binding can be monitored in the presence and the
complete absence of mgatp; the ki values under the two
conditions reflect the opener affinity of sur in these two
states. for sur2b(ys), we found for a-312110 a shift of 70
which is significantly lower than for p1075 (200; this study)
and that for the other ‘typical openers’ (b200; russ et al.,
2003). for sur2a(ys), the absence of mgatp increased the
ki values of a-312110 and p075 to a similar degree (140 vs 110,
respectively). taken together, the results show that reduction
of mgatp decreased the affinity of sur2b for a-312110
significantly less than for p1075 (and other typical kcos); for
sur2a, the [3h]p1075 experiments showed the converse.

quast, 1992; löffler-walz & quast, 1998; davis-taber et al.,
2003; all values at 371c). this discrepancy has generally been
observed with kcos (see, for example, schwanstecher et al.,
1998) and is aggravated if both binding and channel opening
are assessed at the same temperature (371c; quast et al., 1993).
it probably reflects the complex signal transduction within the
channel in which kco binding affects the atpase activity of
sur, thereby determining the channel activity (bienengraeber
et al., 2000; zingman et al., 2001). regarding the efficacies in
channel opening, the two openers were similar as well.
interestingly, both openers exhibited an almost two times
higher efficacy in activating the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b than the
sur2a channel, and this may be related to the stronger
inhibition of the  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a channels by mgatp (see also
reimann et al., 2000).

interaction of a-312110 and p1075 with surs

in conclusion, we have characterised here the binding and
channel-opening properties of a novel dihydropyridine kco,
a-312110, in comparison to the standard opener p1075, in
recombinant systems. the results show that a-312110 is a
potent kco with properties similar to those of p1075. the
new opener, which is available in radioiodinated form (davistaber et al., 2003), makes a welcome addition to the
chemically diverse group of  xxxg1253xxx  openers.
