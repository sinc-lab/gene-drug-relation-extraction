abstract
the molecular and pharmacological properties of adenosine receptors in the t24 human bladder epithelial carcinoma cell line were assessed by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), ca2+ flux, camp production and  xxxg562xxx  measurements. rt-pcr
experiments detected the presence of transcripts for the adenosine a1, a2a and a2b receptors but not for the adenosine a3 subtype. application of
specific adenosine receptor ligands resulted in concentration-dependent increases in intracellular calcium ([ca2+]i) with the following order of
potency and ec50 values: 5′-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (neca) (1153 ± 214) > 5′-(n-cyclopropyl)carboxamidoadenosine (cpca) (1436 ±
186) > adenosine (4823 ± 932). this rank order of potency is typical of adenosine a2b receptors. in addition, select adenosine receptor antagonists
n-(4-acetylphenyl)-2-[4-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-2,6 dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-1h-purin-8-yl)phenoxy] xxxd63xxx  (mrs 1706), 8-[4-[((4-cyano[2,6-]-phenyl)carbamoylmethyl)oxy]phenyl]-1,3-di(n-propyl)-xanthine (mrs 1754), 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (dpcpx), 1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine
(dpx), alloxazine, 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (csc), and theophylline blocked the neca-induced calcium responses. additionally, neca,
cpca, and adenosine stimulated camp formation with a rank order of potency characteristic of adenosine a2b receptors. the select adenosine
a2a antagonist, 5-amino-7-(phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c] pyrimidine (sch 58261) failed to antagonize the neca
response, whereas the potent and highly selective adenosine a2b antagonists mrs 1754 and mrs 1706 inhibited neca-stimulated camp
production. lastly, neca-induced  xxxg562xxx  secretion was inhibited by mrs 1754. taken together, these data indicate that [ca2+]i
accumulation and camp production as well as  xxxg562xxx  secretion is mediated through the  xxxg83xxx  in the t24 cell line.

1. introduction
adenosine, a product of atp catabolism, is released at sites
of tissue inflammation, injury, and ischemia. the endogenous
release of adenosine exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on
surrounding cells by decreasing the production of toxic oxygen
metabolites, inhibiting phagocytosis, and stimulating autacoid
secretion from various inflammatory cells (cronstein, 1994,
1995). in addition to an anti-inflammatory effect, adenosine has
the ability to regulate both peripheral and central pain signaling
via interaction with one of four different g protein-coupled
receptors (sawyork, 1998). these receptors have been classified

as adenosine a1, a2a, a2b and a3 based upon their molecular
and pharmacological properties. for example, in humans, the
adenosine a3, a1, and  xxxg82xxx  subtypes are activated at
submicromolar concentrations of adenosine (0.29 µm, 0.31µm,
and 0.73 µm, respectively) while the  xxxg83xxx  is
activated at a much higher physiological concentration of this
ligand (23.5 µm, fredholm et al., 2001b). this finding suggests
that the human adenosine a1, a2a, and a3 subtypes respond to
physiologic concentrations of adenosine, while the adenosine
 xxxg83xxx  requires a higher, pathophysiologic concentration
of this agonist for activation.
in addition to differences with respect to pharmacological
characteristics, adenosine receptor subtypes can be further
distinguished by their indirect effect on adenylate cyclase
activity. for example, the adenosine a1 and a3 receptors have

p.t. phelps et al. / european journal of pharmacology 536 (2006) 28–37

an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase activity and camp
production via signal transduction through pertussis toxinsensitive proteins (gi). in contrast, activation of adenosine a2a
and  xxxg83xxx  subtypes has a stimulatory effect on adenylate
cyclase and lead to an increase in camp accumulation (liu and
salter, 2005).
because of their widespread distribution, adenosine receptors
have been implicated in a vast array of biological and
physiological processes. binding of adenosine to the adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  produces analgesia, and this analgesic effect is lost in
knockout mice which lack the  xxxg81xxx  (johansson
et al., 2001). expression of the human  xxxg82xxx 
subtype is high in the central nervous system, spleen, thymus,
blood vessels, and platelets (peterfreund et al., 1996). recent
studies have shown that this receptor plays a critical role in the
degeneration of neuronal cells. in addition, there is also evidence
that adenosine a2a attenuates inflammatory responses incited by
the release of cytokines (armstrong et al., 2001; ohta and
sitkovsky, 2001). the human adenosine a2b receptors are
expressed at low levels in many tissue types, with high
expression seen in a few select tissues such as the large intestine,
urinary bladder, blood vessels, and mast cells (puffinbarger et
al., 1995). activation of adenosine a2b by adenosine leads to
mast cell degranulation, vasodilatation of blood vessels, and an
increase in production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and  xxxg562xxx  (mead et al., 2002; volpini et al., 2003).
the human adenosine  xxxg84xxx  message has been found in
both lung and liver tissue, with lower levels in aorta and brain
(salvatore et al., 1993). the adenosine  xxxg84xxx  subtype is
thought to be involved in locomotor activity (jacobson et al.,
1993), as well as modulating allergic responses, the latter
mediated via the release of histamine from mast cells
(ramkumar et al., 1993). thus, because of their ubiquitous
nature, adenosine receptors play important roles in a diverse
array of complex physiologic and pathological processes.
in the present study, we have examined the expression of the
adenosine receptor subtypes present in the t24 human urinary
bladder urothelial carcinoma cell line. this well-characterized
cell line is an excellent cellular model system for elucidating
molecular mechanisms associated with pathologic bladder
conditions such as interstitial cystitis (keay et al., 2004).
using a wide array of well established adenosine agonists and
antagonists as pharmacological tools, we identified the
 xxxg83xxx  as the predominant functional receptor
subtype in the t24 cell line. to our knowledge, this is the first
complete investigation and characterization of the adenosine
receptor subtypes to be performed in the t24 cell line. the data
generated from this study will provide information involving
the mechanisms associated in adenosine-mediated transmembrane signaling and its role in bladder function.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
the t24 bladder epithelial carcinoma cell line (atcc htb-4)
was purchased from american type culture collection (atcc,

29

manassas, va, usa) and cultured in mccoy's 5a medium with
1.5mm l-glutamine (atcc), supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (fbs, atcc), 100u/ml penicillin, 100µg/ml
streptomycin, and 2.5 µg/ml  xxxd164xxx  (all from gibco,
carlsbad, ca, usa). cells were maintained at 37°c and 5%
co2 in a humidified atmosphere.
2.2. rna extraction and cdna preparation
total rna was prepared from the t24 cell line using the
ambion totally rna kit (ambion, austin, tx, usa)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, 5 × 106
cells were processed in 1 ml volume of denaturing solution.
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol was then added to the cell
homogenate, and the rna was extracted from the aqueous
phase after the sample was spun at 14,000×g. the rna was reextracted in one starting volume of acid phenol/chloroform,
precipitated with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 20 µl sterile
rnase-free water. the rna quality was assessed by both gel
electrophoresis and absorbance ratios of 260nm/280nm. a
600pg aliquot of total rna from the t24 cell line was utilized
for rt-pcr and reverse-transcribed into cdna using the
superscript one-step rt-pcr with platinum taq kit (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca usa) in accordance with the manufacturer's
directions. in brief, the target rna was reverse-transcribed and
amplified in 25 µl of 2 × reaction mix [0.4 mm dntps, 2.4mm
 xxxd2534xxx ], containing 0.3 µm of primers and 2.5u of superscript
ii reverse transcriptase and platinum® taq dna polymerase,
to make a final volume of 50 µl. the reaction was carried out in
an automated dna thermal cycler (geneamp pcr system
9700, perkin elmer applied biosystems, foster city, ca,
usa) as follows: reverse transcription, 50 °c for 30 min, reverse
transcriptase inactivation, 94 °c for 2 min. then the first-strand
cdna was amplified by subjecting the mixture to 35 cycles of
pcr using the following conditions: denaturing at 94 °c for
30s, primer annealing at 58°c for 30s, primer extension at
68°c for 1.5 min and a final extension step at 72 °c for 7 min.
ten microliters of the pcr product was visualized on a 3%
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. oligonucleotide
primers for rt-pcr were designed according to the published
sequences for human adenosine receptors (genbank accession
numbers: human adenosine a1: xxxg81xxx ; human adenosine
a2a: xxxg82xxx ; human adenosine a2b: xxxg83xxx ; human
adenosine a3: xxxg84xxx ). the various primer pairs used for
the pcr reactions are shown in table 1. ß-actin was used as an
internal positive control.

from tocris (ellisville, mo, usa). 5-amino-7-(phenylethyl)2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c] pyrimidine
(sch 58261) was synthesized by the chemistry department
of schering-plough research institute (kenilworth, nj, usa).
all drugs were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and
stored at − 20.0 °c. the final concentration of dmso was less
than 0.1% (v/v) in all assays.
2.4. measurement of ca2+ via fluorometric imaging plate
reader (flipr)
t24 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well
into black-walled, clear-base 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated
plates (bd biosciences) in 100 mul of complete mccoy's 5a
media and incubated overnight at 37°c and 5% co2. on the
day of the experiment, the cells were incubated for 45 min at
37 °c in hank's  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) containing
10 mm hepes ph 7.4, 1% bsa, and 2.5 mm probenecid, with
the addition of 4 µm of the calcium indicator fluo-4am
(molecular probes, eugene, or, u.s.a.) which had been
solubilized in dmso and combined with an equal volume of a
20% pluronic acid solution per manufacturer's instructions
(molecular probes). the cells were washed three times in 200 µl
of the above mentioned hank's buffer (without fluo-4am) and
allowed to incubate for an additional 30 min at 37 °c in 100 µl of
pre-warmed buffer prior to the assay. the plates were then
placed into an flipr (molecular devices, sunnyvale ca,
usa) with a heated stage (37 °c) to monitor cell fluorescence
before and after the addition of various agonists and antagonists.
after addition of compound, change in fluorescence was
monitored for a period of 5min and maximal increase in
fluorescent signal was noted. antagonists were added to cells in
a volume of 50 µl via the flipr and allowed to incubate for
6 min prior to the addition of agonist. to assess activation,

responses were measured as the difference between the
maximum and minimum fluorescent signals obtained in each
well upon agonist addition. data are presented as the percentage
of the maximal response for each agonist. antagonist assay
responses were normalized for comparison based on maximal
signal generated (neca 700nm) upon addition of t24 cells.
2.5. camp measurement
camp production in t24 cells was assessed using a nonradioactive immunoassay obtained from meso scale discovery
(gathersburg, md, usa) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. in brief, t24 cells were cultured overnight in
mccoy's complete medium in the absence of serum. on the day
of the experiment, the cells were harvested using cell
dissociation buffer (gibco, carlsbad, ca, usa) and then
incubated at room temperature for 5 min with  xxxd3142xxx  (30 µm)
to block endogenous phosphodiesterase in assay buffer
provided with the kit. the cells were added at a density of
∼1 × 104 cells per well to 384 well plates precoated with camp
antibody and containing test compounds. camp was measured
according to manufacturer's instructions.
2.6. neca stimulation of  xxxg562xxx  secretion
production of  xxxg562xxx  in t24 cells was measured using
a sandwich immunoassay developed by meso scale discovery.
briefly, t24 cells (2 × 104) were seeded into 96-well plates 24 h
prior to the experiment and cultured as described previously.
neca was dissolved in hank's  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss)
supplemented with 20mm hepes (invitrogen) and added to the
cell culture at various concentrations for 4 h. the adenosine a2b
receptor antagonist studies were performed by pre-treating the
cells for 15 min in the presence of mrs 1754 (1µm) prior to the
addition of neca. cell supernatants were removed and stored
at − 20 °c prior to the detection of  xxxg562xxx . detection of
 xxxg562xxx  present in the cell medium was determined using
the meso scale discovery (msd) sector imager 6000
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.7. data analysis
data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. curve fitting and
calculation of both the ec50 and ic50 values were determined

using graphpad prism v3.02 (graphpad software, inc., ca,
usa).
3. results
3.1. expression of adenosine receptor total rna in t24 cells
using rt-pcr under optimized conditions with primer sets
specific for the four cloned adenosine receptor subtypes,
expression of adenosine receptors a1, a2a, a2b and a3 were
evaluated in the t24 cell line. at the total rna level, an
abundant amplicon was detected in t24 cells for the adenosine
a2a and a2b transcripts, with an  xxxg81xxx 
amplification product present at a marginally lower level (fig.
1). there was no detectable band for the adenosine a3
receptor transcript. all pcr products ran as single, discrete
bands when visualized on an agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide. these bands corresponded to the expected
size of pcr products for each adenosine receptor subtype (a1:
525 bp, a2a: 544bp, a2b: 491bp,  xxxg53xxx : 838 bp). additionally, negative controls lacking template total rna during
cdna synthesis did not yield pcr products. the internal
standard,  xxxg53xxx , was successfully reverse-transcribed, thus
the first strand cdnas were properly amplified under the pcr
conditions utilized.
3.2. pharmacological characterization of the t24 cell line
using flipr assay
to elucidate the activity of adenosine receptor subtypes in
the t24 cell line, functional analysis was carried out by
measuring agonist-evoked increases in [ca2+]i via the flipr
assay. in all, seven previously characterized adenosine agonists
were tested. of these, the addition of neca, cpca and
adenosine led to concentration-dependent increases in [ca2+]i
fluorescence in the t24 cell line and were full agonists (fig. 2).
the ec50 values corresponding to these three agonists tested are
listed in table 2. the rank order of potency obtained from the

fig. 2. comparison of adenosine agonists to stimulate [ca2+]i uptake in t24
cells. cells were dye-loaded with fluo-4am and [ca2+]i was measured before
and after the addition of each test compound using the flipr assay. the
calculated ec50 values for adenosine, cpca, and neca were 4823 ± 931.9nm,
1436 ± 186.2nm and 1153 ± 214.1nm, respectively. data are measured as peak
increase in fluorescence minus basal, and expressed relative to the maximum
response for neca for each experimental run. results are expressed in nm
concentrations as the mean ± s.e.m. of at least four separate experiments.

most potent agonist to the least potent was: neca (1153 ±
214nm) > cpca (1436 ± 186nm) > adenosine (4823 ± 932nm)
(table 2). this rank order of potency is consistent with results
obtained previously for the human  xxxg83xxx 
(patel et al., 2003). the response curves generated by these
agonists displayed similar kinetic profiles (data not shown) and
both neca and cpca were found to be full agonists when
compared to adenosine (fig. 2).
addition of other specific adenosine receptor agonists,
ccpa ( xxxg81xxx ), ab-meca (a3), ib-meca
(a3) and csg-21680 hydrochloride ( xxxg82xxx )
failed to stimulate any increase in [ca2+]i up to concentrations
of 50 µm (fig. 2 and data not shown). that there was no
measurable response in the t24 cell line upon addition of cgs
21680, an agonist with low potency at the human adenosine a2b
receptor subtype further supports that the calcium response in
these cells is mediated through the  xxxg83xxx 
(klotz et al., 1998).
the ability of various adenosine antagonists to inhibit a
neca-induced ca2+ response in t24 cells was analyzed using
the flipr assay. as shown in fig. 3, all five of the antagonists
tested were able to inhibit a neca (700 nm)-induced ca2+
response in a concentration-dependent manner. ic50 values and
order of potency ranking were as follows: mrs 1706 (53 ±

(2358 ± 647.7nm) > theophylline (4167 ± 500.6 nm) (table 3).
none of these antagonists displayed any agonist activity. the
most selective  xxxg83xxx  antagonist, mrs 1754
(kim et al., 2000), had an ic50 value of 57 ± 3.4 nm in the t24
cell line consistent with the published ic50 value reported for
the cloned human adenosine a2b subtype (fredholm et al.,
2001a). likewise, the activity of dpcpx (96.5 ± 20.1 nm) is
also characteristic of that reported for the human adenosine a2b
receptor (50 nm, fredholm et al., 2001a) and not for the
adenosine a1 subtype which has an ic50 value reported to be in
the low nanomolar range (3.9 nm, fredholm et al., 2001a). sch
58261, a selective adenosine a2a antagonist, had no significant
effect on neca-induced increases in intracellular calcium at
concentrations ranging from 500pm to 50µm (data not shown).
similar to the agonists tested, the activity of these antagonists
indicate that the adenosine-induced ca2+ response in t24 cells
is mediated through the  xxxg83xxx .

presence of adenosine, neca and cpca, a concentrationdependent elevation of camp accumulation was observed with
a rank order of potency of neca > cpca > adenosine (fig. 4,
table 4). nonlinear regression analysis gave ec50 values of
864 ± 71.6 nm for neca, 1905 ± 627nm for cpca and 4486 ±
820nm for adenosine. these potency values are consistent with
the pharmacology values of the  xxxg83xxx . the
highly selective adenosine a2a agonist, cgs 21680, failed to
elicit a significant camp response at concentrations up to
10µm (data not shown). the adenosine a3 specific agonists,
ib-meca and ab-meca, and chloro-ib-meca, were
unable to stimulate camp formation at concentrations up to
10µm (table 4 and data not shown).
in order to further define the functional role of adenosine
receptors in the characterization of t24 cells, we tested the
ability of specific adenosine receptor antagonists to block
stimulation of camp formation upon addition of neca
(700 nm). all adenosine antagonists tested significantly inhibited the production of camp in a concentration-dependent
manner with a rank order of potency of chpn (140 ± 20.8)
> sch 58261 (405 ± 112.1) > mrs 1754 (665 ± 64.4) > dpx
(803 ± 135) > dpcpx (821 ± 53.6) > mrs 1706 (1963 ± 422)
> theophylline (3967 ± 569) (table 4). taken together, these
results indicate that adenosine a2b is the only functional
adenosine receptor capable of stimulating camp production in
the t24 cell line (fig. 5).

3.3. effect of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on
camp production in t24 cells

3.4. neca stimulates  xxxg562xxx  production in the t24 cell
line
in this study, we wanted to determine whether treatment of
t24 cells with neca exerts a modulatory effect on interleukin8 secretion. to demonstrate this, cells were treated with
different concentrations of neca for 4 h and interleukin8 production was measured in the growth medium. neca
induced  xxxg562xxx  production in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 6). to further validate the role of adenosine
receptor function in neca-induced  xxxg562xxx  production,
cells were pre-incubated for 15min with mrs 1754 (1 µm), a
selective adenosine a2b antagonist prior to treatment with
neca. the addition of mrs 1754 caused a rightward shift of
the neca dose–response curve and a depression in the overall
 xxxg562xxx  production (fig. 6). these data support a role for
adenosine a2b receptors in neca-induced  xxxg562xxx  secretion in the t24 cell line.

the sensation of bladder fullness to sensory afferents via the
p2x3 receptor located on the surface of these nerve terminals
(burnstock, 2001). in addition to its sensory function, atp
release from the urothelium also has a motor component, in that
it stimulates contraction of detrusor muscle in both rat and
guinea pig tissues (king et al., 1997; burnstock, 1978).
interstitial cystitis is a chronic and painful inflammation of
the bladder urothelium characterized by urinary frequency and
urgency (curhan et al., 1999). urothelial cells cultured from
patients with interstitial cystitis demonstrate elevated levels of
atp release (birder et al., 2003). at these elevated levels, atp
serves as a sensory molecule and plays a direct role in
sensitizing the nociceptive afferents that innervate the urothelial
and suburothelial layer. it is this stimulation of the sensory
fibers that results in the subsequent pain and inflammation
associated with interstitial cystitis (sun et al., 2001). despite
these findings for atp, a relative lack of consideration has been
given to its breakdown product, adenosine. adenosine, formed
via the hydrolysis of atp released from the urothelium,
activates adenosine a1 receptors found in the suburothelial
presynaptic nerve endings. the engagement of adenosine with
the adenosine a1 receptors results in a decrease in adenylate
cyclase activity and subsequent inhibition of the release of
various neurotransmitters that function in the reduction of
nerve-mediated contraction (king et al., 1997). another
function of adenosine is the attenuation of rat and guinea pig
bladder muscle contraction. this effect occurs when adenosine
binds to the adenosine a2 receptors found on the surface of
detrusor myocytes (nicholls et al., 1992; king et al., 1997;
burnstock, 1978). these findings would suggest a role for
adenosine a1 and a2 receptors in the mechanisms associated
with normal bladder function.
the goal of the present study was to provide a conceptual
framework for the molecular mediators potentially involved in
interstitial cystitis by addressing the likely functional roles of
adenosine receptors in the human t24 bladder urothelial cell
line. in order to fully characterize the t24 cell line, we needed to

4. discussion
in this investigation, using a variety of functional assays, we
have provided a detailed pharmacological characterization of
the adenosine receptor subtypes in the human urothelial t24
cell line.
recently it has been reported that adenosine receptors
contribute in large part to the signaling mechanisms arising
from the extracellular degradation of atp to adenosine in the
bladder urothelium (fry et al., 2004). the urinary epithelium
(urothelium) functions as a protective barrier between the
bladder lumen and the underlying connective tissue and bladder
muscle (detrusor). it has been shown that the urothelium
functions as both a sensor and a responder to various types of
chemical and mechanical stimuli. in response to mechanical
stretch, bladder urothelial cells release chemical mediators such
as atp and  xxxd2738xxx  (no) from sensory neurons that
innervate the urothelium (sun et al., 2001, mumtaz et al., 2000).
the release of atp from the distended urothelium propagates

investigate the expression of each adenosine receptor subtype
present, as well as to assess the functional pharmacology of
each receptor using a variety of ligands as probes specific for
each receptor. to do this, we performed rt-pcr to examine the
expression of the human adenosine receptors subtypes, and, in
addition, we characterized the molecular pharmacology of this
cell line using the functional assays that measure changes in
both [ca2+]i and in camp production.
analysis of the t24 cells by rt-pcr revealed expression of
the adenosine a1, a2a and  xxxg83xxx  transcripts. expression
of the adenosine  xxxg84xxx  was not detected. because pcr
results do not necessarily correlate with the presence of a
functional adenosine receptor displayed on the cell surface, we
needed to further characterize the adenosine a1, a2a, and a2b
receptors in the t24 cell line using functional assays. the
adenosine receptor subtypes are functionally characterized by
their signaling mechanisms and their association with different
second messenger systems. the adenosine a1 and  xxxg84xxx 
subtypes modulate cellular functions by interacting with
pertussis toxin-sensitive gi and go proteins. this interaction
inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, resulting in a decrease in
camp formation (for review see fredholm et al., 2001a). both
adenosine a1 and adenosine a3 receptors may also mediate a
ca2+ signal through gi and betagamma-mediated pathways (dickenson
and hill, 1998; englert et al., 2002). in addition, adenosine a3
receptors can also signal through gq and subsequently activate
phospholipase c (plc). plc modulation results in an increase
in intracellular calcium levels (abbracchio et al., 1995). in
contrast, the adenosine a2a and  xxxg83xxx  subtypes couple to
the cholera toxin-sensitive gs proteins activating adenylate
cyclase which results in increased camp levels (ralevic and
burnstock, 1998). in some cell types stimulation of adenylate
cyclase by activated a2b receptors leads to an independent but
concomitant increase in the rise of intracellular calcium. this
increase in intracellular calcium is thought to be brought about
by the activation of a calcium channel by a cholera-toxin
sensitive g protein, after a requisite initial increase in
intracellular ca2+ (feoktisov et al., 1994). the association of
the  xxxg83xxx  with the gs protein is well known,
but recent studies also evidence a direct coupling between
adenosine a2b and the gq protein, which appears to be both cell
and tissue-type dependent (feoktistov and biaggioni, 1995;
linden et al., 1999). this later finding elucidates the mechanism
by which the  xxxg83xxx  modulates increases in
intracellular calcium levels, akin to the adenosine a1 and a3
receptors previously mentioned (fredholm et al., 2001b).
one of the key objectives in performing this pharmacological analysis was to characterize adenosine receptor function in
t24 cells using select pharmacological agonists specific for
each receptor. this can often be challenging in cell lines
expressing both adenosine a2a and a2b receptors, as there is no
selective agonist specific for the adenosine a2b subtype. this
difficulty can be overcome by using select agonists such as cgs
21680 which activates only the a2a subtype and can thereby
functionally distinguish between an adenosine a2a response
and adenosine a2b response. the flipr assay is a technique
which has become increasingly popular in assessing the

functional response of g protein-coupled receptors, such as
adenosine, in various cell types (porter et al., 1999). this
method is especially advantageous in discriminating between
the functional responses of receptors such as adenosine a2b and
a2a that are co-expressed and that signal predominantly
through both gs and gq. the adenosine analogue neca is a
potent a2b agonist, yet it is non-selective and will activate
adenosine a1, a2a and a3 receptors in addition to the adenosine
a2b subtype. using neca in combination with adenosine
receptor antagonists specific for adenosine a2b, a1, a2a, and
 xxxg84xxx  subtypes, we determined the relative functional
contribution of each receptor subtype, as measured by increases
in [ca2+]i using the flipr assay. treatment of t24 cells with
adenosine agonists revealed a rank order of potency of
neca > cpca > adenosine (table 2). these findings correlate
well with  xxxg83xxx  pharmacology as reported
previously for both recombinant and endogenous adenosine
a2b (feoktistov and biaggioni, 1993, 1998; mirabet et al.,
1997). the affinity values obtained for neca and adenosine
(1153 ± 214.1 nm, and 4823 ± 931.9 nm, respectively) are in
agreement with those reported for hek-293 cells transfected
with the human  xxxg83xxx  (1110 ± 240 nm, 6220 ±
960nm, patel et al., 2003). in addition, treatment of the cells
with cpca, a potent and selective  xxxg83xxx 
agonist, activated the receptor with an ec50 of 1436 ± 186.2 nm.
although the presence of total rna message for adenosine a1
and  xxxg82xxx  was detected in the t24 cell line, neither
ccpa nor cgs 21680 (specific for adenosine a1 and a2a,
respectively) were able to generate a [ca2+]i signal. absence of
stimulatory activity of cgs 21680 is characteristic of that
reported for  xxxg83xxx  subtypes, and is an
accepted indication of the absence of a functional adenosine
 xxxg82xxx  (lupica et al., 1990; feoktistov and biaggioni,
1993; pelletier et al., 2000).
to further investigate the pharmacologic properties of the
adenosine receptors in the t24 cells line, antagonist studies
were performed using the flipr assay. by inhibiting a neca
(700 nm)-evoked ca2+ response, dose–response curves were
generated in the presence or in the absence of adenosine
antagonists. in all, seven antagonists were tested and all
inhibited the neca-induced ca2+ responses in a concentrationdependent manner. the most potent of those tested were the
select adenosine a2b antagonists mrs 1706 and mrs 1754,
with ic50 values of 53 ± 5.8 nm and 57 ± 3.9nm, respectively.
the low nanomolar potency of these antagonists indicates that
adenosine a2b is the predominant receptor subtype responsible
for the inhibitory activity observed in response to neca. taken
together, our results from the flipr analysis suggest the
presence of a functional  xxxg83xxx  capable of
stimulating increases of intracellular calcium presumably via
direct interaction with the gq protein.
the activation of the adenosine a2a or a2b receptors is
traditionally associated with gs interaction resulting in camp
accumulation (bruns et al., 1986) whereas adenosine stimulation of adenosine a1 and a3 receptors has an inhibitory effect
on camp formation due to its association with gi. to further
characterize the adenosine receptor subtypes that are

p.t. phelps et al. / european journal of pharmacology 536 (2006) 28–37

functionally expressed in the t24 cell line, we evaluated the
effects of neca and other select adenosine agonists and
antagonists on cellular camp production. our results demonstrated that neca stimulated camp production more potently
than did adenosine or cgs 21680 (potency order: neca >
adenosine > cgs 21680). this rank order of potency is in
agreement with data generated from previous studies for the
 xxxg83xxx  subtype (feoktistov and biaggioni,
1998). the ec50 value for neca (864 ± 71.6) is similar to
estimates previously reported for the  xxxg83xxx 
cloned from human brain (alexander et al., 1996). the inability
of the selective adenosine a2a antagonist cgs 21680 to
significantly stimulate camp production at concentrations
below 10µm is commensurate with an inactive adenosine
 xxxg82xxx  (pelletier et al., 2000) and allows us to further
distinguish between the two adenosine a2 receptors coexpressed in this cell line. in addition, this data reveals that
despite the presence of an adenosine a2a transcript in the t24
cells, some post-translational events must occur which
modulate the amount of functional protein present. adenosine
induced camp formation with an ec50 value of 4485
± 819.5 nm. this low potency level further supports an
adenosine a2b response. under normal physiologic conditions,
adenosine concentrations are low (between 30 and 300 nm), and
adenosine a1 and a3 receptors are activated exclusively. but in
disease states such as ischemia, levels of adenosine rise from 10
to 1000 fold and stimulate adenosine a2b receptors (hagberg et
al., 1987; dux et al., 1990). the low potency value of adenosine
in the camp assay further supports an  xxxg83xxx 
profile (alexander et al., 1994).
review of the antagonist data also supports the conclusion
that adenosine a2b is the sole functional adenosine receptor
present in the t24 cell line. responses to a submaximally
effective concentration of neca (700 nm) were inhibited in the
t24 cell line by a variety of antagonists tested. the rank order
of potency was chpn > sch 58261 > mrs 1754 > dpx >
dpcpx > mrs 1706 > theophylline. sch 582621, an adenosine a2a-antagonist with low nanomolar potency (∼ 1nm at
human adenosine a2a, merighi et al., 2001) was completely
inactive in the ca2+ flux assay. we were, however, able to
observe antagonism in the camp assay (405 ± 112.1 nm). the
reason for this is not readily apparent, though by potency criteria,
sch 58261 is not acting as an adenosine a2a antagonist. these
results might be indicative of a more complex biology that is
beyond the scope of the current studies. despite these
differential findings, the overall rank order of potency for the
antagonists tested in the camp assay are consistent with the t24
cell line expressing an  xxxg83xxx  coupled
positively to adenylate cyclase through gs.
interstitial cystitis is a chronic disease of the bladder
urothelium with symptoms such as pelvic pain, urinary
frequency and urgency. it is characterized by an increase in
accumulation of many urine components including the
inflammatory cytokine  xxxg562xxx  (peters et al., 1999). in
mast cells and smooth muscle cells,  xxxg562xxx  release has
been shown to be mediated via the activation of adenosine a2b
receptors (feoktistov et al., 2003). using the t24 cell line as a

35

cellular model of human bladder urothelium, we investigated
the potential signaling roles of adenosine receptors associated
with  xxxg562xxx  production. our study demonstrated that
treatment of the t24 cell line for 4h with neca resulted in an
increase in  xxxg562xxx  production which was sensitive to the
adenosine a2b antagonist mrs 1754 (fig. 6), indicating that the
cytokine production was a2b-mediated.
adenosine is released from the bladder urothelium in
response to the inflammation associated with interstitial
cystitis, binding to adenosine a1 and a2 receptors located in
the both the bladder nerve membrane and in the detrusor
muscle (fry et al., 2004). to date, there has been no
pharmacological characterization of adenosine receptors in
the human bladder urothelium and this may be due in part to the
lack of potent agonists select for each subtype. for this reason,
we performed functional assays using non-selective adenosine
agonists in combination with potent adenosine a2b antagonists
as pharmacological tools to provide an alternate approach to
characterize the adenosine receptor subtypes in the t24 cell
line. upon examining ca2+, camp, and cytokine functional
responses in these cells, we determined that the endogenous
adenosine receptor linked to the release of these factors
exhibited the requisite agonist and antagonist properties
characteristic of the  xxxg83xxx  subtype. that all
of the functional responses generated in t24 cells were
mediated by the activation of the  xxxg83xxx 
illustrates the importance of this receptor subtype in the role of
urothelial function, and raises the possibility that adenosine a2b
receptors might be a useful target in future drug discovery.
antagonists generated against adenosine a2b receptors located
within the bladder detrusor muscle could have a role in
diminishing if not abolishing the extreme urinary frequency
associated with interstitial cystitis. by blocking adenosine a2b
receptors, the increase in urothelial-derived atp that accompanies interstitial cystitis would presumably fail to result in
detrusor overactivity. validation of the overall effect of
adenosine a2b inhibition and its role in bladder function awaits
further in vivo investigation and would serve to additionally
define the functional role of this receptor. taken together, our
results suggest that adenosine, through its interaction with the
 xxxg83xxx , may have a role in modulating
urothelial function and cytokine production in hypersensory
disorders of the bladder such as interstitial cystitis.
