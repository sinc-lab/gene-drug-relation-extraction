summary
histamine not only mediates immediate allergic reactions, it also regulates
cellular immune responses.  xxxg1081xxx  is the most recently identified histamine
receptor (hr). in the present study, we examined the in vitro effect of
histamine and  xxxg1081xxx  agonists on the responses of human t cells to purified protein derivative from mycobacterium tuberculosis (ppd) and to cry
j1, the major allergen of cryptomeria japonica pollen. dimaprit, clobenpropit and clozapine, which are  xxxg1081xxx  agonists, dose-dependently blocked
both ppd-induced interferon-c and cry j1-induced  xxxg1180xxx  production by both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and antigenspecific t-cell lines. however, the addition of thioperamide, an  xxxg1080xxx / xxxg1081xxx 
antagonist, as well as a mixture of d-chlropheniramine,  xxxd2082xxx  and
thioperamide, did not reverse the inhibition. pretreatment of pbmcs
with sq22536 and 8-bromoadenosine-30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphorothioate,
rp-isomer, had varying abilities to reverse the inhibitory effects of  xxxg1081xxx 
agonists, except for clobenpropit. moreover, the addition of  xxxg1081xxx  agonists
induced annexin-v expression on pbmcs, especially in  xxxg375xxx + and cd4+
cells. cdna microarray analysis revealed that, among 16 600 genes tested,
increased expression following treatment with clozapine was seen in 08%
of the genes, whereas decreased expression was seen in 30% of the genes.
these results suggest that  xxxg1081xxx  agonists inhibit antigen-specific human
t-cell responses, although  xxxg1081xxx  does not appear to be important for this
effect. in addition, the present study indicated that there may be orphan
receptors or hr subtypes which can bind dimaprit, clobenpropit and
clozapine, and that can exert an inhibitory effect on antigen-specific cellular responses via a camp/camp-dependent protein kinase-dependent,
apoptotic pathway.

introduction
histamine has numerous physiological effects, including
the induction of allergic responses and gastric acid secretion. these effects are mediated by several histamine receptors (hrs). to date, four subtypes ( xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx ,  xxxg1080xxx  and
 xxxg1081xxx ) of hrs have been identified and cloned. all belong

to the seven-transmembrane domain g-protein-coupled
receptor family, and coupled g proteins and subsequent
activated intracellular signals have been characterized.1 of
these,  xxxg1081xxx  was most recently identified, and this receptor
is expressed at high levels in mast cells and leucocytes.2,3
histamine not only mediates immediate airway hyperresponsiveness, but also regulates cellular immunity by

 xxxg1081xxx -agonistic compounds in ag-specific t-cell responses
controlling the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines, the expression of adhesion molecules,
and the migration of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils.1,4,5 the maturation and activity of dendritic cells
(dcs) is also affected by histamine.6 in addition, histamine regulates t-cell function.7,8 for example, histamine
can enhance t helper 1 (th1)-type responses by stimulating  xxxg1078xxx , whereas both th1- and t helper 2 (th2)-type
responses are negatively regulated by  xxxg1079xxx .7 at present,
there is one report that cd8+ t cells produce interleukin
(il)-16 in response to histamine activation of  xxxg1081xxx .9
however, despite the high expression of  xxxg1081xxx  on both
antigen-presenting cells and t cells, it is not known whether signals through  xxxg1081xxx  affect antigen-specific human
t-cell responses.3 therefore, in the present study, we
investigated the roles of  xxxg1081xxx  agonists in antigen-specific
human t-cell responses. the findings presented here may
help to identify new therapeutic approaches for using hr
agonists to treat allergic diseases.

materials and methods
antigen and reagents
the purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis (ppd) was purchased from nihon bcg seizo co.
(tokyo, japan). cry j1 was purified from the crude extracts
of cryptomeria japonica pollen using a well-established procedure.10 the protein concentration was determined using
a bicinchoninic acid assay (pierce, rockford, il), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. endotoxin contamination was considered to be negligible because of a negative
endospectm es test result (seikagaku kogyo corporation,
tokyo, japan). histamine was purchased from nacalai tesque inc. (kyoto, japan). 2-pyridylethylamine (2-pea;  xxxg1078xxx 
agonist) and 4-methylhistamine (4-mh;  xxxg1079xxx  agonist) were
provided by gsk (welwyn, garden city, uk). dimaprit
( xxxg1079xxx / xxxg1081xxx  agonist), clobenpropit ( xxxg1081xxx  agonist/ xxxg1080xxx  antagonist) and thioperamide ( xxxg1080xxx / xxxg1081xxx  antagonist) were
purchased from tocris (ellisville, mo). clozapine ( xxxg1081xxx 
agonist) was purchased from mp biomedicals (irvine, ca).
a-methylhistamine (a-mh;  xxxg1080xxx  agonist) was a gift from
professor j. c. schwartz (inserm, paris, france). d-chlropheniramine ( xxxg1078xxx  antagonist) and  xxxd2082xxx  ( xxxg1079xxx  antagonist) were provided by yamanouchi pharmaceutical co.
ltd. (tokyo, japan). sq22536 was purchased from sigma
(st louis, mo). rp-8-br-camp was purchased from biolog life science institute (bremen, germany).

obtained from each volunteer. twelve japanese subjects
(five men and seven women; age 20–52 years; mean age
395 years) with positive tuberculin skin tests, and 12
japanese patients (seven men and five women; age 19–
59 years; mean age 374 years) with japanese cedar pollinosis showing a positive skin scratch test to japanese cedar
pollen, were examined. pbmcs were isolated and cultured
as described previously.11 the culture medium used
throughout the study was rpmi-1640 (sigma) supplemented with 10% human ab serum (icn biomedicals, aurora,
oh), 100 u/ml of penicillin, 100 lg/ml of streptomycin
(sigma) and 20 mm l-glutamine (gibco brl, grand island,
ny). in brief, pbmcs (1 · 106/ml) were incubated in the
presence or absence of 2 lg/ml of ppd or 10 lg/ml of cry
j1, together with histamine and/or hr-selective agonists or
antagonists, for 72 hr in 24-well plates (corning inc.,
corning, ny) at 37 in a 5% co2/air mixture. to determine the involvement of adenylate cyclase and campdependent  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) in the action of hr
agonists, pbmcs were pretreated for 1 hr at 37 with 5 mm
sq22536 and 5 mm rp-8-br-camp, respectively.12 after
this incubation, the cells were washed twice with culture
medium and then cultured as described above.

generation and culture of antigen-specific t-cell lines
the cd4+ ppd– and cry j1-specific t-cell lines (tcls)
used were generated using a procedure described previously.10 in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (corning inc.), 2 · 104 tcl were mixed with 1 · 105
irradiated autologous pbmcs (pbmcx) as antigenpresenting cells (apcs). following this, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of antigen (ag), in
02 ml of culture medium, together with hr-selective
agonists, for 65 hr.
to determine adenylate cyclase activity, tcls and/or
apcs were incubated with sq22536 at 37 in 24-well
plates for 1 hr. following this, the cells were washed with
culture medium three times, after which they were mixed
and cultured in the same manner described above.

measurement of cytokine production
the levels of interferon-c (ifn-c),  xxxg1180xxx  and il-10 in culture supernatants were measured using opt eiatm sets
(bd biosciences, san jose, ca), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the detection limits for ifn-c,  xxxg1180xxx 
and il-10 in these assays were 20, 20 and 19 pg/ml,
respectively.

using an  xxxg166xxx -fitc apoptosis detection kiti (bd
biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
stained cells were analysed using a fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (facscan) with cellquest software (bd biosciences).

cdna microarray analysis
cdna microarray analysis was performed using intelligene
hs human expression chips, containing about 16 600
probe sets (takara, tokyo, japan). pbmc (1 · 106/ml)
were incubated with 2 lg/ml of ppd, in the presence or
absence of 100 lm clozapine, for 12 hr. total cellular rna
was extracted by the rneasytm mini kit (qiagen, tokyo,
japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. four
micrograms of total rna from pbmcs treated with
and without clozapine were labeled using the rna transcript surelabel core kit (takara) with cy-5 utp and
cy-3 utp (amersham bioscience corp., piscataway, nj),
respectively, in each paired case. labeled samples were
hybridized to intelligene hs human expression chips,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. after hybridization for 16 hr at 65, the slides were washed and then
scanned for cy-5 and cy-3 fluorescence using the affymetrix 428 scanner (affymetrix japan, tokyo, japan). the
signal intensity of hybridization was evaluated photometrically by the imagene computer program (biodiscovery
k. k., tokyo, japan). a gene expression ratio (cy-5/cy-3)
of > 20 and < 05 was considered significant.

real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
ppd- and cry j1-specific tcls were immediately soaked in
rnalatertm rna stabilization reagent (qiagen) and stored
at )30 until use. total cellular rna extraction, reverse
transcription to generate cdna, and real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were performed as
described previously.10 in brief, the assays were performed
using a geneamp 5700 sequence detection system
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca) with quantitect
sybr green pcr (qiagen). the pcr primer sequences
and product sizes were as follows:  xxxg1078xxx , forward 50 -aagt

( xxxg861xxx ), forward 50 -accacagtccatgccatcac-30
and reverse 50 -tccaccaccctgttgctgta-30 (452 bp).9
the expression level of  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx ,  xxxg1080xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx  was
estimated by dividing each signal into the signal for
268

 xxxg861xxx . as a positive control for  xxxg1080xxx , the testicular cell
line, nec14, was used.13

statistical analysis
statistical comparisons were performed by the non-parametric mann–whitney u-test and wilcoxon’s signed-rank
test. differences were considered significantly different at
a p-value of < 005. values are given as means ± standard
deviation (sd).

results
effect of histamine on ppd-induced ifn-c
production
pbmcs from subjects with positive tuberculin skin tests
produced ifn-c in response to ppd, whereas there was
negligible ifn-c production by pbmcs in the absence of
ppd. histamine inhibited the ppd-induced production of
ifn-c in a dose-dependent manner. typical results are
shown in fig. 1(a). using 12 subjects, the mean concentration of ifn-c induced by ppd was 10 479 ± 10 783 pg/ml.
ifn-c production was significantly inhibited to a mean of
4697 ± 4657 pg/ml (543 ± 358% inhibition; p ¼ 0010
by wilcoxon’s signed-rank test) upon exposure of the cells
to 100 lm histamine (fig. 1b). pbmcs did not produce
il-10 in response to ppd, and the addition of histamine
did not alter il-10 production (data not shown).

effect of hr-selective agonists on ppd-induced
ifn-c production
next, we examined the effect of hr-selective agonists on
ppd-induced ifn-c production.  xxxg1081xxx  agonists, including

dimaprit, clobenpropit and clozapine, inhibited ppdinduced ifn-c production in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 2). complete inhibition of ppd-induced ifn-c production was observed in the presence of 100 lm dimaprit

inhibition; p ¼ 0002), or clozapine (100% inhibition;

of ppd-induced ifn-c production, and partial inhibition
was observed using 100 lm 4-mh (636 ± 165% inhibition; p ¼ 0002) and a-mh (503 ± 350% inhibition;
p ¼ 0004) (fig. 3). none of the hr-related agonists

cells (apcs) and cultured with 2 lg/ml of ppd for 65 hr in the presence of 100 lm 2-pyridylethylamine (2-pea), 4-methylhistamine
(4-mh), alpha-methylhistamine (a-mh), dimaprit (dim), clobenpropit (cb) and clozapine (cz). following incubation, supernatant

induced il-10 production in ppd-stimulated pbmcs
(data not shown).
similar results were seen when we used ppd-specific
tcls, the more purified cell populations. we generated
five ppd-specific tcls from five donors. treatment with
2-pea, 4-mh and a-mh did not affect the ppd-specific
ifn-c production. however, treatment with dimaprit,
clozapine and clobenpropit strongly and dose-dependently
inhibited these responses (fig. 4).

effect of hr-selective antagonists on the inhibition
of ifn-c production by  xxxg1081xxx -selective agonists
to verify that the  xxxg1081xxx -selective agonists inhibit ppdspecific ifn-c production via  xxxg1081xxx , we examined the
influence of a panel of hr-specific antagonists. addition
of thioperamide, an antagonist of both  xxxg1081xxx  and  xxxg1080xxx ,
did not reverse the inhibition of ppd-induced ifn-c
production by either histamine or  xxxg1081xxx  agonists
(fig. 5a). furthermore, a mixture of d-chlorpheniramine,
 xxxd2082xxx  and thioperamide did not reverse the inhibition (fig. 5b). these results were seen in both high
responders (ifn-c production > 10 000 pg/ml) and low
responders (ifn-c production < 10 000 pg/ml) for ppdinduced ifn-c production (data not shown).

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were pretreated for
60 min with sq22536 (sq) or rp-8-br-camps (rp) and then incubated with 2 lg/ml of ppd and 100 lm histamine (a), dimaprit (b), clobenpropit (c), or clozapine (d). the results are expressed as the mean

0 lm (square), 01 lm (diamond) or 10 lm (circle) d-chlropheniramine,  xxxd2082xxx  and thioperamide. then, cells were incubated
with 2 lg/ml of purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis (ppd) and 100 lm histamine (his), dimaprit (dim), clobenpropit (cb), or clozapine (cz). results are presented as the mean
concentrations ± standard deviation (sd) from triplicate cultures.
data are representative of three separate experiments.

role of adenylate cyclase and apoptosis in histamine
suppression of ppd-induced ifn-c production
we examined whether the inhibition by histamine and
 xxxg1081xxx -selective agonists depends on the activity of ade270

nylate cyclase. pretreatment of pbmcs with sq22536, an
adenylate cyclase inhibitor, reversed the inhibition of
ppd-induced ifn-c production by histamine and dimaprit. furthermore, pretreatment with rp-8-br-camps, a
pka type 1 inhibitor, completely reversed the inhibition
by histamine and dimaprit (fig. 6a,b). pretreatment of
pbmc with sq22536 and rp-8-br-camps also reversed
the inhibition by clozapine (fig. 6d), but the effects were
weaker than observed for the reversal of inhibition by
histamine. however, a minimal effect of sq22536 and
rp-8-br-camps was seen on the effect of clopenpropit
(fig. 6c). these results were seen in both high and low
responders for ppd-induced ifn-c production (data not
shown). the addition of sq22536 or rp-8-br-camps
had no effect on the ifn-c production by pbmcs in
response to ppd alone (data not shown).
pretreatment of ppd-specific tcls alone with sq22536,
followed by coculture with intact apcs, partially suppressed inhibition of the ppd-specific ifn-c production by
dimaprit. similar suppression was observed when apcs
alone were pretreated with sq22536, followed by the coculture with intact tcls. however, pretreatment of both tcls
and apcs with sq22536 markedly reversed the inhibitory
effects of dimaprit on the ppd-specific response (fig. 7).
the addition of 100 lm dimaprit, clobenpropit, or
clozapine, but not of histamine, induced annexin-v
expression on pbmcs (fig. 8).  xxxg375xxx + cells were highly

ence or absence of clozapine. among 16 600 genes tested,
the amounts of mrna were unchanged in 962% of the
genes. however, the mrna levels of 08% of the genes
(such as  xxxg1384xxx ) were increased
(> 200%) in the presence of clozapine. on the contrary,
the mrna levels of 30% of the genes, such as ifn-c,
were decreased (< 50%) (table 1).

also induced annexin-v expression in cd4+ cells, but not
in cd8+ cells (data not shown).

mrna in pbmc following ppd stimulation in the pres 2007 blackwell publishing ltd, immunology, 121, 266–275

we examined the effect of hr-selective agonists on
human th2 responses. pbmcs from patients with japanese cedar pollinosis produced a comparable amount of
 xxxg1180xxx  in response to cry j1. the addition of 100 lm
2-pea, 4-mh or a-mh displayed no significant effect on
cry j1-induced  xxxg1180xxx  production. however,  xxxg1081xxx  agonists,
including dimaprit, clobenpropit and clozapine, significantly inhibited cry j1-induced  xxxg1180xxx  production (fig. 9).

expression of the four histamine receptors
on ag-specific tcls
finally, mrna expression of the four histamine receptors
was examined in five ppd- and five cry j1-specific tcls
by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rt–
pcr).  xxxg1080xxx  mrna expression was completely undetectable in all tcls. on the other hand,  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx 
mrna were clearly detected in most tcls (fig. 10).
using real-time pcr analysis, relative expression levels of
the four hrs were not observed to differ significantly
among cry j1- and ppd-specific tcls ( xxxg1078xxx , p ¼ 0117;
 xxxg1079xxx , p ¼ 0245;  xxxg1081xxx , p ¼ 0344; using the mann–whitney u-test). the expression levels of  xxxg1081xxx  in tcls were
lower than that of  xxxg1078xxx ; however, significantly increased
expression of the  xxxg1081xxx  was observed as compared to  xxxg1079xxx 
and  xxxg1080xxx  (fig. 11).

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated that histamine
inhibits ppd-induced ifn-c production in pbmcs.
several studies have investigated the regulatory role of
histamine on ifn-c production by t cells.7,8,14–16 lagier
et al. reported that histamine inhibits ifn-c production
by human th1-like t-cell clones (tccs) specific for
dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, whereas it did not have
a significant inhibitory effect on t helper 0 (th0)-like
tccs, and it had no effect on th2-like tccs stimulated
with phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) and a calcium ionophore.8 krouwels et al. reported that histamine
inhibited ifn-c production in 21 out of 52 human tccs
(40%), whereas ifn-c production was enhanced in eight
of the tccs (16%). also, histamine did not affect ifn-c
production in 23 tccs (44%) in response to plate-bound

 xxxd2676xxx  mab.14 in contrast, pretreatment with histamine does enhance ifn-c production in response to
plate-bound  xxxd2676xxx  mab in human th1 cells.7 furthermore, osna et al. showed that the effect of histamine
on ifn-c production was dependent on the stimulatory
signals.15
we investigated the ppd-induced human t-cell
responses to clarify whether histamine affects antigenspecific t-cell responses. our results are consistent with
previous reports. osna et al. reported that histamine upregulates il-10 production in murine splenocytes and
inhibits ifn-c production.16 in the current study, pbmcs
did not produce il-10 in response to ppd, and il-10
production was not induced in the presence of histamine,
suggesting that factors other than il-10 may be involved
in the inhibitory effect of histamine.
the  xxxg1081xxx  agonists dimaprit, clobenpropit and clozapine
all eliminated ppd-induced proliferation and ifn-c production in pbmcs.  xxxg1081xxx  is selectively expressed in cells of
haematopoietic lineage, including mast cells, eosinophils
and lymphocytes.3,17 physiological roles of  xxxg1081xxx  in mast
cells, eosinophils, neutrophils and dendritic cells have
been implied in recent years, but whether signals through
 xxxg1081xxx  can affect t-cell functions has not been determined.6,17–19 one report demonstrated that histamine

induces il-16 production by human cd8+ t cells
through  xxxg1079xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx .9 our results, using hr-related
agonists, suggest that signals through  xxxg1081xxx  may exert an
inhibitory role on antigen-specific t-cell responses. however, thioperamide, an  xxxg1080xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx  antagonist, did not
reverse the inhibition of ppd-induced ifn-c production
by either histamine or  xxxg1081xxx  agonists. thioperamide,
d-chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2082xxx , the hr antagonists
used in the present study, were confirmed to be functional in previous studies.20,21 this suggests that the
inhibitory effect of histamine and  xxxg1081xxx  agonists is not
mediated by  xxxg1081xxx . in addition, a mixture of d-chlropheniramine,  xxxd2082xxx  and thioperamide did not reverse
the inhibition by histamine, suggesting that the effect is
independent of  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx  and  xxxg1080xxx / xxxg1081xxx .
2-pea, an  xxxg1078xxx -selective agonist, did not affect ppdinduced ifn-c production. on the other hand, 4-mh, an
 xxxg1079xxx -selective agonist, partially inhibited its production.
it is known that histamine regulates cytokine production,
via  xxxg1079xxx , on t cells.8,14,15,22 in addition, histamine inhibits il-12 production by monocytes via  xxxg1079xxx .23 our finding that dimaprit, an  xxxg1079xxx  and  xxxg1081xxx  agonist, inhibited
ppd-induced ifn-c production, suggests that signals
through  xxxg1079xxx  may be involved in the inhibition. however, the inhibitory effect of either histamine or dimaprit

japanese cedar pollinosis were cultured with 10 lg/ml of cry j1, in
the presence or absence of 2-pyridylethylamine (2-pea), 4-methylhistamine (4-mh), alpha-methylhistamine (a-mh), dimaprit (dim),
clobenpropit (cb) or clozapine (cz), at 100 lm, for 72 hr. following
incubation, supernatant was collected and the concentrations of  xxxg1180xxx 
were determined in each sample using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). p-values were obtained using wilcoxon’s
signed-rank test.

the levels of  xxxg1078xxx ,  xxxg1079xxx ,  xxxg1080xxx ,  xxxg1081xxx  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

figure 11. comparison of the amounts of four histamine receptors
(hrs) among t-cell lines (tcls). the expression levels of four hrs
were determined in five cry j1-specific tcls (closed triangle) and in
five purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis (ppd)specific tcls (open circle) using real-time reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction (rt–pcr). each bar represents the
median expression level of each messenger. p-values were obtained
using wilcoxon’s signed-rank test.

the pretreatment of pbmcs with sq22536, an adenylate
cyclase inhibitor, and with rp-8-br-camps, a pka type 1
inhibitor, reversed the inhibition of ppd-induced ifn-c
production by histamine and  xxxg1081xxx  agonists. previous
reports demonstrated that 5 mm sq22536 and 5 mm rp8-br-camps reversed, almost completely, the inhibitory
effect of several compounds on human pbmc responses.12
these results suggest that  xxxg1081xxx  agonists, except for clobenpropit, inhibit ppd-induced ifn-c production by elevating
intracellular camp levels and activating pka. moreover,
results using ppd-specific tcls and apcs suggest that
 xxxg1081xxx  agonists may influence ppd-specific cellular responses
at both the t-cell and apc level. it is known that  xxxg1079xxx  activation causes an elevation of the intracellular camp level.24
in addition, pka plays a pivotal role in histamine-mediated
regulation of ifn-c production, especially via the stimulation of t-cell receptors.15 although dimaprit can act as an
 xxxg1079xxx  agonist, clozapine and clobenpropit cannot.25  xxxg1081xxx  is
coupled to gi/o, which leads to the inhibition of camp formation.26 this further supports the possibility that the
inhibitory effect of  xxxg1081xxx  agonists is not associated with typical  xxxg1081xxx  signaling. rather, signals similar to those mediated by  xxxg1079xxx  may participate in the inhibition. however,
we also observed that the inhibitory effect of either histamine or dimaprit was not reversed by  xxxd2082xxx , suggesting that  xxxg1079xxx  signaling had a negligible role in the
inhibition of ppd-induced ifn-c production. in addition,
the varied effect of sq22536 and rp-8-br-camps on ifn-c

production induced by different agonists may suggest the
presence of unidentified pleural receptors in the action of
agonists.
 xxxg375xxx + and cd4+ cells express annexin-v following
exposure to  xxxg1081xxx  agonists, suggesting that these compounds induce apoptosis in these cells. on the other
hand, cdna microarray analysis revealed that the changes
of mrna levels were seen in 08% of the genes tested,
such as  xxxg1384xxx , following the stimulation with  xxxg1081xxx  agonist (table 1), indicating that the
inhibitory effects of  xxxg1081xxx  agonists were not non-specific
or solely the result of an apoptotic effect. for example,
 xxxg1384xxx  has signal transducer activity and
it is involved in immunosuppression.27 thus, the suppressive role of  xxxg1081xxx  agonists may be associated with the activation of  xxxg1384xxx . in addition, histamine
did not induce the expression of annexin-v. these results
suggest that the inhibitory effect of  xxxg1081xxx  agonists is not
associated with the binding to classical hrs.
concentrations of histamine and  xxxg1081xxx  agonists ranging
from 10)5 to 10)4 m displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of ppd-induced ifn-c production by pbmcs.
although it was difficult to define precisely the histamine
concentration in the target organ, concentrations of histamine from 10)6 to 10)4 m have been reported to be comparable to those measured in tissues after mast cell
degranulation.28
in conclusion, we examined the effect of histamine and
 xxxg1081xxx  agonists on antigen-specific human t-cell responses.
 xxxg1081xxx  signaling is important for functions of other immune
cells, such as mast cell chemotaxis, eosinophil chemotaxis
and suppression of il-12 production by dendritic cells.3,29
 xxxg1081xxx  agonists inhibit ag-specific cytokine production; however, our investigations, using antagonists of  xxxg1081xxx  and
inhibitors of adenylate cyclase or pka, revealed that  xxxg1081xxx 
plays a negligible role in the inhibition. these results indicate that there may be a previously unidentified hr or
receptor subtype that can bind to dimaprit, clobenpropit
and clozapine and that can mediate the inhibition of antigen-induced cellular responses via a camp/pka-dependent, apoptotic pathway. more recently, lim et al. have
reclassified 4-mh as the most selective  xxxg1081xxx  agonist so far
at the  xxxg1081xxx .30 this seems to be relevant for understanding
the present results, suggesting a new orphan receptor. furthermore, our observations may provide the basis for novel
therapeutic approaches in the management of allergic and
autoimmune diseases.
