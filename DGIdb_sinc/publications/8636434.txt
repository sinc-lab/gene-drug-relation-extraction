therapy with oral  xxxd1732xxx  induces inhibition of the  xxxg1267xxx  and reduction of erythrocyte dehydration in patients with sickle cell disease.  pathologic water loss from sickle erythrocytes concentrates the abnormal hemoglobin and promotes sickling. the ca2+-activated k+ channel ( xxxg1267xxx ) contributes to this deleterious dehydration in vitro, and blockade of k+ and water loss via this channel could be a potential therapy in vivo. we treated five subjects who have sickle cell anemia with oral  xxxd1732xxx , a specific  xxxg1267xxx  inhibitor. patients were started on a dose of 10 mg  xxxd1732xxx /kg/d for one week. protocol design allowed the daily dose to be escalated by 10 mg/kg each week until significant changes in erythrocyte density and k+ transport were achieved. blood was sampled three times a week for hematological and chemical assays, erythrocyte density, cation content, and k+ transport. at dosages of 20 mg  xxxd1732xxx /kg/d, all subjects showed  xxxg1267xxx  inhibition, reduced erythrocyte dehydration, increased cell k+ content, and somewhat increased hemoglobin levels. adverse effects were limited to mild/moderate dysuria in all subjects, and a reversible increase in plasma  xxxg941xxx  and aspartic transaminase levels in two subjects treated with 30 mg  xxxd1732xxx /kg/d. this is the first in vivo evidence that the  xxxg1267xxx  causes dehydration of sickle erythrocytes, and that its pharmacologic inhibition provides a realistic antisickling strategy.
