carbamate esters*

we previously showed that the zinc metalloenzyme
carbonic anhydrases(ca i and i1 isozymes) bind “neutral” amides and relatedcompounds as anions through
coordination of their deprotonated amide nitrogen to
the active site zinc (rogers, j. i., mukherjee, j., and
khalifah, r. g . (1987)biochemistry 26,5672-5679).
urethan, the ethyl carbamate ester, was among such
compounds. the present study was designed to test
whether other n-unsubstituted carbamate esters
of
pharmacological interest (assedatives, hypnotics,anxiolytics, and skeletal muscle relaxants) were capable
of binding to ca in the same manner.we studied the
interaction of human ca i and i1 with urethan, phenyl
carbamate,  xxxd2053xxx , meprobamate, and  xxxd2598xxx . phenyl carbamate studies were greatly
complicated by its uncatalyzed hydrolysis via anelimination
mechanism to form cyanate, a powerful ca inhibitor.
i n general, the compounds display: 1) slow on-off inhibition binding kinetics inthe seconds range, 2)maximal inhibitor affinity at alkaline ph, and 3) characteristic three-band visible spectra of their complexes
with cobalt-substituted ca i. theseproperties are
shared with the previously studied amide inhibitors
and are taken asevidence that the deprotonated carbamate nitrogen coordinates to the active site metal
ion. ca i appeared to bind carbamate
esters more
tightly than ca 11, an unusual 1000-fold selectivity
being seen in the case
of  xxxd2598xxx . the inhibition
by these drugs is not sufficiently strong to implicate
ca i and i1 in their mechanism of action. however, it
does suggest the possible existence of previously unsuspected similarities between binding to ca and to
their physiological receptors or targets, particularly
the involvement of zinc.

common, open-angle glaucoma (maren et al., 1983; maren,
1991; sugrue et al., 1985; shepard et al., 1991; lippa, 1991).
a numberof homologous ca isozymes, designated i-vii, that
are differentially distributed in mammalian tissues have now
been identified (tashian, 1989; hewett-emmett and tashian,
1991). the design or discovery of isozyme-specific inhibitors
of ca would be of considerable use in elucidating the specific
physiological functions that may be unique to these various
ca isozymes (lindskog and wistrand, 1989).
the major human erythrocyte isozymes i and 11, which
differ nearly 10-fold in specific co, hydration activity (khalifah and silverman, 1991), show significant differencesin
inhibition (lindskog et al., 1971; maren and sanyal, 1983;
lindskog and wistrand, 1989). the lowerspecific activity
isozyme i binds anionic inhibitors some 100-fold more tightly
than ca i1 (lindskog et al., 1971; maren and sanyal, 1983).
the consequence of this has been emphasized by maren, who
noted that ca i is largely inhibited by physiological concentrations of chloride in erythrocytes (marenet al., 1976; chapman and maren, 1978). the ca-specific sulfonamide inhibitors of pharmacological interest inhibit isozymes i and i1
fairly similarly, with ca i1being a littlemore strongly affected
(maren and sanyal, 1983). in striking contrast, the very low
specific activity muscle ca i11 is nearly refractory to sulfonamides while being strongly inhibited by the anions (sanyal
et al., 1982; maren and sanyal, 1983). the understanding of
the molecular bases for these differential effects is enhanced
by the availability of crystal structures of the major isozymes
andtheir inhibitor complexes (eriksson and liljas, 1991;
eriksson et al., 1988a, 1988b;kannan et al., 1984; vidgren et
al., 1990) and by recent site-specific mutagenesis studies (behravan et al., 1989, 1990, 1991;lindskog et al., 1991; fierke et
al., 1991; nair et al., 1991; lograsso et al., 1991).
nearly all ca inhibitors bind at or close to the essential
metal ion of the active site (bertini and luchinat, 1983;
the zinc metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca)’ (ec lindskog, 1982, 1983). they usually substitute for the  xxxd2076xxx .2.1.1) is abundantly present in erythrocytes. however, it is changeable solvent ligand (water or hydroxide, depending on

sumed to bind
as neutral species (rogerset al., 1987; khalifah
et al., 1987). to our surprise, we found that the zinc ion of
ca i and i1 is readily able to deprotonate such weakly basic
groups (pk, near 14-15). 15n nmr unambiguously proved
that they can bind as the  xxxd2066xxx  anions at the zinc in a
strictly analogous fashion tosulfonamide binding (mukhejee
et al., 1987). thebinding of all thesecompounds to ca
displays characteristic p h profiles, on-off kinetics, and d-d
visible spectra with cobalt-substituted ca (rogers et al.,
1987). among such compoundswas urethan, the ethyl carbamateesteret-0-c(=o)nh2,
which is widely used as a n
anesthetic in small animalstudies.
in attempting to extend these studies,
we noted that many
homologues of urethan are pharmacologically active drugs
that have been used or are currently being
used as hypnotics,
sedatives, anxiolytics, and muscle relaxants (gilman et al.,
1985). table i lists some of these compounds taken from the
merck index (budavari, 1989). they all share the
basic r-oc(=o)nh2 structure that is
capable of coordinating the zinc
metal ion through a deprotonated nitrogen. however, they
encompass a great diversity in the alkyl ester side-chain
structure. the question thus arose
as to whether any orall of
these compounds could fit into theactive site of ca and bind
while coordinating to the zinc. we now report that ca can
indeedinteractinsimilarfashionwithrepresentative
nunsubstituted carbamate esters.t o our knowledge, no interaction with, or binding to, carbonic anhydrase hasbeen previously reported for these compounds, and no involvement
with metal ion coordination has been reported for them in
any biological system. furthermore, the major erythrocyte
isozymes i and i1 differ markedly in their affinity for these
compounds, possibly accounting for theprevious lack of recognition of their interaction withca. it should be emphasized
that the carbamate ester drug binding to ca i is not sufficiently strong to implicate this isozyme in their direct physiological modes of action. however, our results pose the intriguing questionof whether thereceptors or targetsfor these
drugs share similarities with the
ca active site, including the

i and 11

utilization of a zinc metal ion. mention should also be made
that the approaches developed in our present study are
clearly
applicable to establishing themode of binding of carbamoyl
phosphate to ca. this anionic carbamateesterhas
been
reported to inhibitca i, 11, and i11 equally well (carter et al.,
1984), but it is not
known whether it bindsthroughthe
phosphate group, as originally assumed, or through the
amide
group of the carbamate.

chemicals-ultrapure grade cobalt sulfate was a product of johnson-matthey. xxxd1593xxx  (sigma)was used asthe primary buffer
throughout the ph range studied, andthe ionic strength was always
maintained at 0.2 m using sodium or potassium sulfate.  xxxd2598xxx , meprobamate,urethan, and  xxxd2053xxx  were purchased from
sigma.phenyl carbamate waspurchasedfromaldrich.
its stock
solutions were freshly made up in slightly acidic water
to minimize
hydrolysis that is strongly catalyzed by primary or secondary amine
buffers. p-nitrophenylacetatewas obtained from sigma.the skeletal
structures of the carbamates studied here are shown
in fig. 1.
enzymes-human  xxxg287xxx  (formerly called isozyme
b) and i1 (formerly isozyme c) were prepared from freshly outdated
erythrocytes using the affinity chromatography method previously
described (khalifah et al., 1977) and were stored as slurries in saturated ammonium sulfate. apocarbonic anhydrase i was prepared by
the rapid pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylatemethod of hunt et al. (1975).
cobalt-substitutedca i ((co(ii)]cai) was preparedeither by dialysis
of the apoca against cobalt sulfate or by direct addition of a small
excess of cobalt sulfate, followed in both cases by extensive dialysis
against deionized water. cobaltincorporationwas checked by visible
spectroscopy usingthe intense acetazolamide complex(bertini et al,
1978).
spectrophotometry-all spectra were taken on a hp 8452a photodiode arrayspectrophotometer of 2-nm resolution that was
equipped with a hp 89090a temperature controller accessory. the

esterase actiuity assays-esterase activities of ca (verpoorte et
al., 1967; whitney, 1970) were carried out spectrophotometrically at
the isosbestic pointof 348 nm for thep-nitrophenollp-nitrophenolate

and small aliquots were added to initiate hydrolysis in buffered
enzyme or enzyme-inhibitor solutions that had been equilibrated at
25 "c for about 5 min, unless specified otherwise (see below). typical
concentrations for the assays were 0.20 mm for the ester, 5 p m for
ca i, and 2 p m for ca 11. final acetone concentration was less than
1%.

inhibition of the esterase activities of ca i and 11 by
carbamate esters- xxxd2598xxx , meprobamate, and  xxxd2053xxx  were all found to inhibit ca i at ph 8.0, with ki
values ranging from 70 p m for  xxxd2598xxx  to 14 mm for
meprobamate. column 2 of table i1 compares these results
with those of phenyl carbamate, discussed separately below,
and urethan (see also rogers et al. (1987)). the ph dependence of inhibition was studied further for  xxxd2598xxx  and
is given in fig. 2. it can be seen that binding is ph-dependent
and maximal at high ph, with an apparent pk, of 7.0 that is
attributed to the
active site ionization of the zinc-bound water
ligand that is presumably displaced by the inhibitor (rogers
et al., 1987).
in contrast to theappreciable affinity of these compounds
for ca i, the high activity ca i1 shows only weak inhibition
(column 3 of table 11).in thecase of  xxxd2053xxx , no inhibition
could be detected at the highest concentrations ( 6 mm) used.
in general, the ratio of affinities for the two isozymes ranges

determination of inhibition dissociation constants-k, values were

interaction of [co(ii)]ca i with phenylcarbamate-as
aromatic and heterocyclic sulfonamides are much stronger
inhibitors than alkyl sulfonamides (maren, 1967), we attempted tomeasure the inhibition of ca byphenyl carbamate.
inconsistent results were obtained when esterase inhibition
studies using 5-min incubations were compared with spectral
titration experiments on the cobalt-substituted enzyme that
were of variable duration. thesepuzzling results promptedus
to carry out detailed kinetic observations of the inhibition.
the use of [co(ii)]ca i was advantageous, since the spectral
changes that invariably accompany the ca inhibition could
be monitored.
fig. 3 shows that complex spectral changes accompany
inhibition when 0.1 mm [co(ii)]ca i is mixed with 0.6 mm
phenyl carbamate at ph 8. in the first 30 s, a rapid reaction
occurs with a half-time of about 4 s (fig. 3a, inset) resulting
in a complex with a spectrum showing three main bands at
520,568, and 614 nm. this change is accompanied by clearly
defined isosbestic points at 534,556, and 646 nm, as indicated
by the arrows in fig. 3a. following this, a slower change
occurs with a half-time of about 70 min (fig. 3b, inset) that
results in the formation of an inhibitor complex having a
more intense absorption in the 580-590 nm range. this slow
change is accompanied by new isosbestic points at about 518
and 614 nm (fig. 3b, arrows). the rates of the fast and the
slow reactions were both increased by about 50% by doubling
the phenyl carbamate concentration (data not shown), suggesting that theexplanation of the biphasic behavior was not
a slow intramolecular conformational change in the initial
inhibitor complex. it could be accounted for by the formation
of two distinct phenyl carbamate complexes, with a slower
reaction for the more tightly bound complex, but this was
deemed to be quite unlikely.
at this point, the stability of phenylcarbamate
was
checked, and it was found by uv absorbance at 270 nm that
phenyl carbamate hydrolyzed to release phenol under these
conditions with a half-time of about 575 min, i.e. an order of
magnitude slower than the slow phase of the reaction in fig.
3b. (note that separate control experiments failed to reveal
any catalysis of the phenyl carbamate hydrolysis by ca i.)
however, phenol is only a weak inhibitor of ca i (verpoorte

et al., 1967) and caused only slight spectral changes in [co(ii)]
ca i when added at 0.6 mm (data notshown). it thusbecame
apparent that the otherproduct of hydrolysis of phenyl carbamate was not carbamic acid (nh3 coz) but rather isocyanic acid. this is contrary to some assertions (march,1977)
but is consistent with early although indirect conclusions (cf.
dittert andhiguchi, 1967). cyanate is known to be a powerful
inhibitor of ca i, with an estimated kiof about 10 pm at this
ph (sanyal et al., 1983; maren and sanyal, 1983). the final
spectrum in fig. 3b indeed proved identical to thatproduced
by addition of cyanate alone (data not shown; cf. bertini et
al., 1978). we must thus conclude that the initial complex
formed is that between [co(ii)]ca i and phenyl carbamate,
and the latter
is slowly displaced by the more powerful cyanate
released by the slow hydrolysis of phenyl carbamate. kinetic
simulations using the diffeq (micromath, inc.) solver and
the additional association-dissociation rates discussed below
(cf. prabhananda et al., 1987) provided a full reproduction of
all the observations, including the dependence on the initial
phenyl carbamate concentration,

30 s after adding phenyl carbamate, the complex was dissociated by adding an excess of the powerful sulfonamide acetazolamide (diamox). the kinetic constants obtained are given
in table i11 and are compared with similar results for  xxxd2598xxx  and urethan.
inhibition of the esteraseactivities of ca i and 11 by phenyl
carbamate-the resolution of the kinetics complexities above
also made it possible to utilize the esterase activity to measure
the k, for phenyl carbamate. the time of incubation of
inhibitor with enzyme was carefully limited to 30 s before
initiating the esterase hydrolysis through addition of p-nitrophenylacetate, and theenzyme concentration was adjusted so
that the initial rates were rapidly determined. the ki values
obtained in this way for ca i and ca i1 are listed in table
11. excellent agreement can be seen between the spectroscopic
and esterase inhibition determinationof the k; for ca i.

liljas, 1991) reveals that it can readily accommodate the
roc(=o)nh--zn interaction in both
isozymes. however,the
metal coordination by itself is not usually sufficient to account
for the enormous stabilization seen (cf. sigel and martin,
1982). the inhibitor complexes ofca with sulfonamides
(vidgren et al., 1990) clearly suggest how additional interactions can lead to a chelate effect. zinc deprotonates one of
the 2 amidic hydrogens of the carbamate group (labeled 1 in
the phenyl carbamate structure in fig. 1). the remaining
amide proton (labeled 2) must form a strong hydrogen bond
to the oxygen of thr-199 side chain, whereas the carbonyl
oxygen (labeled 3) should form a hydrogen bond with the
main-chain peptide nh of the same residue, analogous to the
binding of the sulfonamido group of acetazolamide (vidgren
et al., 1990). this orientation places the ester oxygen (labeled
4 ) in van der waals contact with the c2h of the imidazole
ring of his-94, one of the three zinc ligands of ca, thus

perhaps the most intriguing in view of its severe conformathe results presented in the current study make it clear
that the binding mode of urethan can be generalized to nthr

in the proposed manner.  xxxd2598xxx  binding is illustrative in this regard. affinity is maximal at high ph, which is
consistent with either binding as the  xxxd2066xxx  anion to the
“acid” form (zinc-water) of the active site, or with binding as
the neutral compound to the basic (zinc-hydroxide) form of
the enzyme. only the former interpretation is consistent with
the slow on-off kinetics (table 111). it is important to note
that, in contrast,most anionic inhibitors of ca bind with rate
constants in the lo6 to lo9 m” s” range (maren, 1992;
prabhananda et al., 1987; king and burgen, 1976). the spectral changes seen in [co(ii)]ca i upon complexation clearly
indicate major changes in themetal ion environment consistent with coordination. indeed, the molar extinction coefficients are indicative of near tetrahedral environments (cf.

tional restrictions. it has a linear acetylenic protrusion (indicated by the arrow in fig. 1)in combination with a cyclohexyl side chain. it is quite remarkable that it does indeed fit
into the active site of ca i, for which it was obviously not
designed. molecular modeling suggests an extremely close fit,
and molecular mechanics studies should be better able to
distinguish why the tolerances are acceptable in ca i but
apparently not in ca 11. in this regard, carbamate inhibition
and molecular modeling studies onca i11 would beextremely
interesting, as its much smaller active site cavity (eriksson
and liljas, 1991) appears to only tolerate the binding of small
anions (sanyal et al., 1982; maren and sanyal, 1983). noca
111-specific inhibitors have been reported so far.
the findings reported in this studynaturally raise the
question of whether the binding of carbamate ester drugs to
ca has any pharmacological or physiological relevance. certainly for ca i and 11, a direct association appears highly
unlikely. the study of other ca isozymes, such as themuscle
ca 111, the membrane-bound ca iv, and any brain or central
nervous system ca would beneeded to generalize this conclusion. a more productive and intriguing question is whether
the binding mode seen for the inhibition of ca by the carbamate ester drugs may be relevant to whatever receptor(s) or
enzyme(s) they may bind to. these compounds are certainly
expected to interactwith the benzodiazepine or other gabaa
family of receptors (gilman et al., 1985; burt and kamatchi,
1991), but a unique receptor or target for them has not been
identified to our knowledge. our findings suggest directions
to investigate. most important in this regard is the possible
involvement of a zinc binding site for them. metal ion binding
in receptors is rare but not unprecedented (cunningham and
wells, 1991). smart (1992) has recently reported that zn2+
exhibits an antagonism ofgabaa-induced membrane currents, aneffect that is not blocked by several gabaa effectors,
and has speculated that it binds to  xxxg220xxx  of the closed
form of the receptor. it could well be that metalloenzyme or
metalloreceptor targets exist for carbamate esters, or that
znz+might enhance their physiological interactions. all the
pharmacologically active compounds showing the common
activities noted in table iare n-unsubstituted. alkylation of
the carbamate nitrogen is expected to interfere severely with
coordination to zinc. indeed, pocker and guilbert (1974) have
reported that n-substituted carbamate esters do not show
much affinity for ca 11. their studies, and ours on n-unsubstituted derivatives, also indicate that thereis no ca catalysis
of the hydrolysis of carbamate aryl esters ingeneral.
possible similarities between receptors or targets for nunsubstituted carbamate esters and ca suggest some reciprocal exploration. for example, ca-specific drugs or other ca
inhibitors, such as cyanate, may well interfere with or potentiate the physiological activity of such carbamate esters. we
do not know if such studies have ever been carried out. it is
interesting that acetazolamide and  xxxd2592xxx  do have
anti-convulsant activities (sharedwith at least one carbamate
ester shown in table i) that have led to their use for seizure
therapy (lindskog and wistrand, 1989; gilman et al., 1985).
the mode of this action is believed to be through the potentiation of the vasodilation activity of coz (saperstein et al.,
1984; gilman et al., 1985; cross et al., 1978). it is not known
whether this mechanism of action is relevant to thediscovery
that ca inhibitors may be effective new drugs for treatment
of essential tremor (muenter et al., 1991; koller, 1991). this
primary mode of action of the ca inhibitors does not preclude
their interacting with other receptors or targets.mention
should also be made of the interesting discovery of a carelated protein of unknown function that is selectively ex-

pressed in purkinje neurons (kato, 1990).
clearly, much remains to be discovered about the physiological actions of the various ca isozymes (dodgson et al.,
1991). the selective inhibition of the various isozymes would
be very useful in delineatingsuch functions. the extension of
our studies onthe carbamate esterscould be quite useful along
these lines. indeed,  xxxd2598xxx , with its apparent 1000fold preference for ca i over cai1 (table 11), may already
be unique among the non-ionic inhibitors of these isozymes.
selective inhibition of ca i has been of interest inmeasuring
the relative contribution of the individual ca isozymesin
erythrocytes and indetecting the ca i1 deficiency discovered
by sly (sly et al., 1983). bromopyruvate was successfully
utilized in such studies (jilka et al., 1985; conroy and maren,
1985; sundaram et al., 1986), as it selectively alkylates an
active site his-200 of ca i (gothe and nyman, 1972). however, the extreme reactivity of this compound toward thiols
andother functional groups makes its use impractical in
physiological studies, such as those that might require perfusion. this drawback is notshared by the unreactive and
neutral  xxxd2598xxx .
finally, mention should be made of the interesting discovery that ca is inhibited by an anionic carbamate ester. carter
et al. (1984) have found surprisingly that isozymes i, 11, and
i11 are equally inhibited by a naturally occurring metabolite,
carbamoyl phosphate, with an apparent ki of about 0.2 mm
at ph7.1 and 2 "c. however, the phdependence and kinetics
of this inhibition were not studied, so that it is not possible
to say whether it was bound through the phosphate group,
through the carbamate amide group, or through both. moreover, this compound readily hydrolyzes by an eliminationaddition mechanism to yield cyanate (allen and jones, 1964),
a complicating factor that we found above with phenyl carbamate. cyanate,unlike sulfonamides, is as equally inhibitory
ofcai11 as it is ofca i and i1 (maren and sanyal, 1983).
our present study clearly provides the methodology to elucidate all these aspects of the inhibition ofcaby carbamoyl
phosphate.
