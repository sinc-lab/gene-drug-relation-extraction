abstract—three novel metabolites of the angiotensin-ii (a-ii) receptor antagonist  xxxd3295xxx  have been identiﬁed in humans, and
the syntheses and pharmacologic proﬁling of these metabolites are reported. each metabolite bound the human a-ii receptor with
ic50s between 20 and 45 nm. the in vivo eﬀects of these compounds in attenuating the pressor response to angiotensin-ii challenge
in anesthetized rats were also investigated. an unsaturated diol metabolite exhibited in vivo eﬃcacy at intravenous doses of 1 and
3 mg/kg, while the other metabolites, both carboxylic acids, had no signiﬁcant eﬀect at the same doses. # 2002 elsevier science ltd.

the development of drugs that act by modulating the
renin–angiotensin system has produced a variety of
agents over the past two decades.1 the initial class of
compounds inhibited the enzymatic production of
angiotensin-ii by acting on angiotensin converting
enzyme (ace inhibitors),2 followed by compounds that
blocked the angiotensin-ii receptor.3 importantly, new
data concerning the eﬃcacy of these drugs continue to
be developed. for example, the recently published
hope trial indicated that ace inhibition was unexpectedly associated with reduced myocardial infarction,
and renoprotective eﬀects of a-ii antagonists independent of eﬀects on blood pressure have been reported in
diabetics.4 these reports indicate that this class of compounds will continue to be a focus of both basic
research and clinical studies.
we have previously reported the development of an
angiotensin-ii receptor antagonist,  xxxd3295xxx , that was
characterized preclinically using both in vitro and in
vivo assays in rodent.5 this agent progressed to clinical
trials, where analysis of plasma from individuals treated
with the compound revealed speciﬁc metabolites that
were proﬁled pharmacologically in an earlier publication.6 an example of one of these previously described
metabolites is compound 2 (fig. 1).

recently, three additional novel human plasma metabolites were isolated. these human metabolites were
oxidative products of  xxxd3295xxx  characterized by oxidation of one or both methyl groups with or without the
dihydropyridone ring oxidation. spectroscopic analysis
of these metabolites supported the proposed structures.
two of the metabolites were assigned the mono-carboxylic acid structures (3 and 4) and the third was
assigned the structure of the unsaturated diol (5) (fig.
1). for structure conﬁrmation, the purpose of this
research report is to describe the syntheses of these
metabolites, followed by their initial characterization in
vitro and in vivo. in order to proﬁle human metabolites,
the in vitro analysis has speciﬁcally utilized a wellcharacterized human primary cell culture system.7 in
vivo proﬁling was performed using standard rat pressor
assays.
metabolite 3 was synthesized directly from  xxxd3295xxx 
(1) in two steps (scheme 1). selenium dioxide oxidation
in aqueous dioxane aﬀorded the aldehyde (6). further
oxidation (benzeneseleninic acid,  xxxd2298xxx )
furnished the carboxylic acid (3). contrary to that
which was previously reported,5 when the selenium
dioxide oxidation reaction was carried out in anhydrous
dioxane as a solvent, the main product isolated was the
des-methyl pyridopyrimidine derivative (7) rather than
the aldehyde (6). compound 7 was erroneously reported
to be the aldehyde 6.5

 xxxd3295xxx  and its metabolites were tested for the inhibition of [125i]a-ii binding (at1 receptors). for the
determination of angiotensin-ii receptor binding by the
compounds, studies were performed in cultured human
preadipocytes. the test compounds were initially suspended in 100% dmso at a concentration of 10 mm,
then serially diluted with assay buﬀer to yield a ﬁnal
concentration from 107 to 109 m.11 results are shown

linear regression curve ﬁtting from data obtained from 2–3 separate
experiments.

on a heating pad (k-model 100, baxter laboratories),
and a longitudinal incision made on the neck to expose
the right carotid artery and jugular vein. the jugular
vein was cannulated with a saline ﬁlled polyethylene
catheter (pe 10) and used for intravenous drug infusion.
arterial pressure and heart rate were monitored via a
saline ﬁlled polyethylene catheter (pe 10) introduced
into the carotid artery and connected to a p23 id statham/gould pressure transducer. subcutaneous needles
were positioned in the limbs for ecg recordings. all
data outputs were recorded on a gould model 6600
series recorder with a po-ne-mah data acquisition system and displayed on a physiology platform crs800w/
crs400w recorder.

groups of rats (n=3–5 each). each rat was subjected to four separate
bolus injections of angiotensin-ii following the introduction of either
the vehicle or graded doses of  xxxd3295xxx  (1) (panel a), metabolite 3
(panel b), metabolite 4 (panel c) and metabolite 5 (panel d) (0.3, 1.0,
or 3.0 mg/kg, iv). data are presented as percent change (meansem)

respective treatment group.

metabolite 3
the experimental protocol for assessing in vivo a-ii
antagonist activity involved compound dosing followed
by measurement of the pressor response to a-ii challenge. each rat from an individual treatment group
(n=3–5) was initially dosed intravenously (iv) with
either vehicle (2% ethanol in saline solution) or test
compound (1, 3, 4, or 5). the test compounds were
administered initially at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (iv) followed 2 min later by angiotensin-ii challenge (3 mg/kg,
iv), and the maximal increase in mean arterial pressure
was recorded. twenty minutes later, baseline pressure
values were re-established and the next dose of test
compound (1.0 mg/kg, iv) was administered followed by
angiotensin-ii challenge. this regimen was repeated for
the 3.0 mg/kg dose for each test compound. all animals
were euthanized at the conclusion of the protocol.
each rat was randomly assigned to one of four drug
treatment groups in an eﬀort to evaluate the in vivo
pressor response to an angiotensin-ii challenge in the
presence of one of the test compounds listed above. a
dose–response protocol was established and the maximal
change in arterial pressure following angiotensin-ii was
recorded for each dose of the compound. the results were
represented as a percent change in maximal pressure
recorded before and after the angiotensin-ii challenge.

 xxxd3295xxx  (1)
there was a 32  0.2% increase in arterial pressure to an
angiotensin-ii challenge in the absence of any test compound in the group of rats assigned to this treatment
group. administration of  xxxd3295xxx  at doses of 1.0 and
3.0 mg/kg (iv) signiﬁcantly (p< 0.05) attenuated the
pressor response to angiotensin-ii (fig. 2, panel a).

there was a 38 7% increase in arterial pressure to an
angiotensin-ii challenge in the absence of any test compound in the group of rats assigned to this treatment
group. administration of metabolite 3 at doses of 0.3,
1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg (iv) did not attenuate the pressor
response to angiotensin-ii (fig. 2, panel b).

metabolite 4
there was a 41 4% increase in arterial pressure to an
angiotensin-ii challenge in the absence of any test compound in the group of rats assigned to this treatment
group. administration of metabolite 4 at doses of 0.3,
1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg (iv) failed to signiﬁcantly attenuate
the pressor response to angiotensin-ii (fig. 2, panel c).

metabolite 5
there was a 47 6% increase in arterial pressure to an
angiotensin-ii challenge in the absence of any test compound in the group of rats assigned to this treatment
group. administration of metabolite 5 at doses of 1.0
and 3.0 mg/kg (iv) signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) attenuated the
pressor response to angiotensin-ii. the 0.3 mg/kg dose
did not alter the pressor response to the bolus injection
of angiotensin-ii (fig. 2, panel d).
we describe the syntheses of three previously unidentiﬁed human metabolites of  xxxd3295xxx  (1) and their in
vitro inhibition of a-ii receptor binding in human cell
cultures. while all three metabolites bound the a-ii
receptor, the 2-carboxylic acid metabolite 4 showed the
greatest in vitro activity with an ic50 of 23  1.3 nm.

1970

h. m. elokdah et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 12 (2002) 1967–1971

the 4-carboxylic acid metabolite 3 and the bishydroxymethyl metabolite 5 were equipotent (ic50=
44 0.30 nm and ic50=44 0.54 nm, respectively).
however, in vivo testing of the three metabolites did not
yield parallel results. at test doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg (iv),
metabolite 5 produced a signiﬁcant attenuation of the
hypertensive response to a-ii challenge similar to that
observed for  xxxd3295xxx . metabolites 3 and 4 had no
signiﬁcant eﬀect at the same doses. these data indicate
that while all metabolites have similar in vitro inhibitory
activity, only the unsaturated diol exhibits in vivo
activity at the doses tested. future studies examining the
pharmacokinetics of each compound, including plasma
stability and protein binding, need to be undertaken to
better understand the diversity between in vitro and in
vivo results.

11. between passages 2 and 5, preadipocytes from the subcutaneous depot (zen-bio, research triangle park, nc, usa)
were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well.
cells were maintained in medium 199 supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (life technologies, grand island, ny, usa). the
experiment was initiated by aspirating the medium and rinsing
the cells twice with phenol red-free medium 199. the binding
assay was then begun by adding 160 ml of binding buﬀer
(50 mm tris, 5 mm mgcl2, 0.25% bovine  xxxg124xxx , ph
7.4; sigma, st. louis, mo), 20 ml of 10 mm unlabelled a-ii
(nonspeciﬁc binding), 20 ml of buﬀer (total binding), or 20 ml
of test compound. the cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by addition of 20 ml of 125i-[sar1,ile8]a-ii (amersham, arlington heights, il, usa). the
culture plate was shaken gently for 1 h at room temperature,
followed by aspiration of the medium. each well was rinsed
twice with 300 ml of the assay buﬀer, followed by addition of
100 ml of 0.5 m naoh/0.5% triton to solubilize the cells. the
radioactivity from each well was then determined in an
appropriate detector.
