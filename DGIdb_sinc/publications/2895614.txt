structure-activity relationship of organic nitrates for activation of  xxxg1587xxx .  the effect of different organic nitrates on the activity of soluble  xxxg1587xxx  prepared from rat liver was investigated. we found a close correlation between the number of nitrate ester groups and the potency of  xxxg1587xxx  activation. for  xxxd2032xxx  (etn, ec50 = 14.5 microm),  xxxd2741xxx  (gtn, ec50 = 60 microm), isoidide dinitrate (iidn, ec50 = 0.24 mm) and isosorbide-5-nitrate (is-5-n, ec50 = 1 mm), we were able to set up an equation by which the ec50 could be calculated from the number of nitrate groups per molecule. compared to these results, the effect of sterical factors and lipophilicity on organic nitrate-induced activation of  xxxg1587xxx  was small. however, there were still significant differences in the ec50 values for the cyclic mononitrates. isosorbide-2-nitrate (is-2-n, ec50 = 0.75 mm) was found to be more potent than the stereoisomeric isosorbide-5-nitrate. similarly, the cyclic dinitrates isomannide dinitrate (imdn, ec50 = 0.20 mm), isoidide dinitrate and  xxxd2402xxx  (isdn, ec50 = 0.28 mm) exhibited small but significant differences in their  xxxg1587xxx  stimulatory potency. two lipophilic ester derivatives of isosorbide-5-nitrate showed a 2-fold potency difference for vasodilation but were equipotent for activation of  xxxg1587xxx  (ec50 = 0.85 mm). also, the increase in lipophilicity due to esterification of the free hydroxylic group had no major influence on  xxxg1587xxx  activation by isosorbide-5-nitrate. these results demonstrate that in a cell-free system, the potency of organic nitrates for  xxxg1587xxx  activation is mainly determined by the number of nitrate groups. since organic nitrate-induced activation of  xxxg1587xxx  may involve the formation of  xxxd2738xxx  free radicals, it is conceivable that the differences in potency reflect a varying degree of  xxxd2738xxx  release from each compound tested.
