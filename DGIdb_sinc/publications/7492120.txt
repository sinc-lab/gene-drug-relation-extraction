the renal membrane dipeptidase ( xxxg649xxx ) inhibitor,  xxxd1693xxx , inhibits the bacterial metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme cpha.  the aeromonas hydrophila ae036 chromosome contains a cpha gene encoding a metallo-beta-lactamase which is highly active against carbapenem antibiotics such as imipenem. here we show that the cpha gene product shares inhibitory similarities with a mammalian zinc peptidase, membrane dipeptidase (mdp;  xxxg649xxx ). both enzymes are able to hydrolyze imipenem and are inhibited by  xxxd1693xxx . the active site similarities of these enzymes are not reflected in any significant primary sequence similarity.
