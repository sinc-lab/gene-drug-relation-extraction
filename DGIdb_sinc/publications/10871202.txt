type 2 diabetes and in lean and obese normal
subjects

low plasma fibrinolytic activity in association with
increased plasma  xxxg2058xxx 
(pai-1) levels has been linked to an increased risk of
atherosclerosis in obesity and type 2 diabetes. we
tested the hypothesis that troglitazone, which improves
insulin sensitivity and lowers plasma insulin levels in
insulin-resistant obese subjects and patients with
type 2 diabetes, would also lower circulating pai-1
antigen concentrations and activity. we assessed
insulin sensitivity (5-h, 80 mu · m–2 · min–1 hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and measured plasma pai-1
antigen and activities and tissue plasminogen activator
(tpa) in 14 patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 normal
control subjects (10 lean, 10 obese) before and after
3 months of treatment with troglitazone (600 mg/day).
at baseline, plasma pai-1 antigen levels after an overnight fast were significantly higher in the obese (33.5 ±
4.7 µg/l) and type 2 diabetic subjects (54.9 ± 6.3 µg/l)
than in the lean control subjects (16.3 ± 3.2 µg/l; p < 0.01
and p < 0.001, respectively). troglitazone decreased
plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic
patients (36.8 ± 5.0 µg/l; p < 0.001 vs. baseline), but the
reduction in the obese subjects did not reach statistical significance (baseline, 33.5 ± 4.7; after troglitazone,
25.6 ± 5.2 µg/l). changes in plasma pai-1 activity paralleled those of pai-1 antigen. the extent of the reduction in plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations in the diabetic patients after troglitazone correlated with the
reductions in fasting plasma insulin (r = 0.60, p < 0.05),
nonesterified fatty acid (r = 0.63, p < 0.02), and glucose
concentrations (r = 0.64, p < 0.02) but not with the
improvement in glucose disposal rates during the glucose clamps. three nonresponders to troglitazone with
respect to effects on insulin sensitivity and fasting
glucose and insulin levels also had no reduction in circulating pai-1. in conclusion, troglitazone enhances
fibrinolytic system activity in insulin-resistant type 2

a

ccelerated atherosclerosis is an important cause
of morbidity and mortality in insulin-resistant
obese subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes
(1,2). low fibrinolytic activity in blood is a wellrecognized major risk factor not only for thrombosis, but also
for atherosclerosis (3,4). deficient fibrinolysis is due primarily to increased concentrations in blood of  xxxg2058xxx  (pai-1), which rapidly binds to and inactivates
tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) (5). pai-1 concentrations
and activity are increased in obese subjects (6–8) and patients
with type 2 diabetes (8–13). the increases may contribute to
an excess risk of cardiovascular disease (4,12–14).
pai-1 levels correlate with a number of variables that
cosegregate in subjects with the insulin resistance syndrome
(15) including bmi, waist-to-hip ratio, and fasting plasma
insulin, triglyceride, and  xxxg175xxx  levels (4,6–10). the
relative contributions of the liver (16), vascular endothelial
cells (17,18), and adipocytes (19,20) to circulating pai-1 levels in health and disease states remain unclear. a key role for
adipose tissue in the elevated pai-1 levels of obesity and
type 2 diabetes is suggested by the finding of markedly
increased pai-1 mrna levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue
that correlate inversely with whole-body insulin sensitivity and
exhibit a diurnal variation similar to that of pai-1 in blood (20).
results of several studies suggest that hyperinsulinemia is
the primary determinant of elevated pai-1 in subjects with
obesity and type 2 diabetes (4,6,9). support for the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance
explained the elevated pai-1 levels came from studies showing that insulin increased pai-1 synthesis by hepatocytes (16)
and vascular endothelial cells (17,18). however, no increase
in plasma pai-1 is found following infusion of insulin under
euglycemic conditions in normal subjects (21–24). moreover,
intensive treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with insulin
lowered pai-1 in blood (10), implying that factors other than
insulin must be important as well. the finding that acute
hyperinsulinemia does increase plasma pai-1 levels in normal
subjects when plasma glucose, nonesterified  xxxd2154xxx 
(nefas), and triglyceride levels are increased concomitantly
(24) underscores the potential importance of interaction

effects of troglitazone on pai-1

between insulin and these other variables in influencing
pai-1 concentrations in blood.
troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, lowers blood glucose in
type 2 diabetic patients primarily by enhancing peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin (25–29). the insulin-sensitizing
action of troglitazone, seen also in insulin-resistant obese
nondiabetic subjects (29), is accompanied by a reduction in
fasting and postprandial insulin levels. thus, if chronic
hyperinsulinemia is an important determinant of elevated
pai-1 with obesity and type 2 diabetes, treatment with troglitazone should lower pai-1 in blood. such an effect would have
important clinical implications, particularly because treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with sulfonylureas increases
pai-1 (30). thus, troglitazone might be a particularly useful
adjunct to therapy in type 2 diabetes for reasons independent
of its glucose-lowering potential.
our aim was to examine the effects of treatment with
troglitazone on pai-1 and tpa antigen concentrations and
activity in blood in patients with type 2 diabetes and lean and
obese normal subjects. we examined the relationships
between changes in these variables and effects of troglitazone
on insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and blood lipids. in
view of the suggestion that adipocytes may be an important
source of pai-1 in obesity and type 2 diabetes (19,20) and the
profound effects of troglitazone on adipocyte gene expression
and metabolism (25,31,32), including an enhancement of
adipocyte sensitivity to insulin, we also examined the influence of troglitazone on the response of pai-1 in blood to a 5-h
infusion of insulin under euglycemic clamp conditions.
research design and methods
fourteen patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 normal control subjects (10 lean, bmi
< 2 7k g / m2, and 10 obese, bmi >27 kg/m2) participated in a study of the effects of
3 months of treatment with troglitazone on pai-i antigen levels and activity in blood.
normal glucose tolerance was verified in all the lean and obese nondiabetic subjects based on results with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. none of the control
subjects were taking any medication known to alter glucose tolerance. the clinical characteristics of the subjects are shown in table 1. none of the patients had
clinical evidence of long-term complications of diabetes. all subjects had normal
renal and liver function tests. six of the diabetic patients were being treated with
sulfonylureas, four with metformin, two with combination therapy with a sulfonylurea and either insulin or metformin, and two with diet alone. the diabetic
patients were asked to continue their usual diet but to discontinue the use of oral
hypoglycemic agents for at least 2 weeks before study. each subject underwent an
80 mu · m–2 · min–1 hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with measurement of
plasma lipids, insulin, pai-1, and tpa levels and activity at baseline and again after
3 months of treatment with 600 mg/day troglitazone. in 12 of the normal subjects
(6 lean, 6 obese) and 9 of the type 2 diabetic patients, blood for pai-1 and tpa antigen and activities was also obtained at the end of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamps before and after troglitazone to delineate the influence of troglitazone on
the response of these variables to a 5-h insulin stimulus.
the study was approved by the human subjects internal review board of the
university of california, san diego; written informed consent was obtained from
each subject.
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. studies were performed after a 10- to
12-h overnight fast. at 0300, an 18-gauge cannula was inserted into an antecubital
vein and a constant infusion of [3- 3h]glucose (0.25 µci/min) (new england
nuclear, boston, ma) was started. for blood sampling, a venous cannula was
inserted retrograde into a distal forearm vein, the hand being maintained in a hand
warmer at 70°c. after each blood sample was taken, this cannula was flushed with
0.15 mol/l nacl in water. after four basal blood samples were taken between 0800
and 0830 for estimation of plasma glucose concentration and specific activity and
serum insulin concentration, an intravenous infusion of insulin (humulin s; eli
lilly, indianapolis, in) diluted in 0.15 mol/l saline containing 1% wt/vol  xxxd100xxx  was begun at 80 mu · m–2 · min–1 from a harvard syringe pump. potassium
and phosphate were given intravenously to compensate for the intracellular
movement of these ions and to maintain normal blood levels. plasma glucose was
measured at 5-min intervals by the glucose oxidase method (ysi 2700 analyzer;
yellow springs instruments, yellow springs, oh) and the blood glucose level was

clamped at 5 mmol/l for 5 h by adjustment of the rate of infusion of a solution of
20% (wt/vol) glucose in water (33). the 20% glucose solution was labeled with
[3- 3h]glucose to maintain plasma glucose specific activities during the clamp
close to basal levels (33). blood samples for glucose concentration and specific
activity were taken every 20 min and for insulin concentrations every 30 min until
270 min, and then every 10 min until 300 min.
analytical procedures. plasma and infusate [3h]glucose specific activity were
determined as previously described (34). insulin was measured by a double-antibody technique (35). the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 6.8
and 7.9%, respectively. plasma nefas were determined with the use of an acylcoa oxidase–based colorimetric kit (nefa-c; wako, richmond, va) with intraand interassay coefficients of variation (cvs) of 2.4 and 3.3%.
tpa and pai-1 were measured in duplicate in edta plasma by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays with recombinant tpa (activase; genentech, south san
francisco, ca) used as a standard. although citrate is generally used as anticoagulant, edta plasma may be used for the assay of pai-1 and tpa (36); in our
laboratory, results with citrate and edta plasma, separated under the conditions
used in this study, are virtually identical. standard curves were obtained with
acidified pooled plasma spiked with tpa to provide a total range of detectable pai-1
activity of 40 arbitrary units (au)/ml. samples were assayed under identical conditions after dilution 40-fold with assay buffer (tris hcl, ph 8.3) containing 0.01%
vol/vol tween 80. standards and samples were pipetted into wells of an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay plate (nunc, roskilde, denmark) before addition of
the chromogenic substrate s-2251 (diapharma, west chester, oh) (final concentration 22 mg/l), plasminogen 104 u/l final (enzyme research laboratories, south
bend, in), cyanogen bromide fibrinogen fragments (30 mg/l final), and tpa 7 u/l
final. incubations were conducted at 37°c for 2.5 h, and plates were read in a spectrophotometer at 405 nm. the method detects active and latent forms of free
pai-1 and pai-1 complexed to plasminogen activators. the tpa method detects both
free and tpa complexed to pai-1. the cv of both procedures used was 9%.
calculation of glucose kinetics. in the basal state, rates of glucose appearance
(ra) and disappearance (rd) were calculated by dividing the [3-3h]glucose infusion rate by the plasma glucose specific activity (the mean of values in the four
basal plasma samples). during the clamp, total ra and rd were calculated from
the [3-3h]glucose data using the non–steady-state equations of steele (37). a distribution volume of 0.19 l/kg and a pool fraction of 0.5 were used in the calculation (38). in the diabetic patients, basal rd was corrected for urinary glucose excretion. hepatic glucose output was calculated by subtracting the exogenous glucose
infusion rate from the total ra.
statistical analysis. results are expressed as means ± se unless otherwise indicated. base 10 logarithmic transformation of plasma pai-1 activity and triglyceride
and fasting insulin levels was used to normalize their distributions. the significance
of differences within groups was tested by student’s paired t test and between
groups by analysis of variance followed by tukey’s multiple comparison test. correlations were sought by pearson’s least-squares method. a p value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

lean (4.9 ± 0.1 vs. 4.8 ± 0.1) and obese (5.1 ± 0.1 vs. 4.9 ±
0.1 mmol/l; ns) normal subjects. the small decline in serum
fructosamine levels in the diabetic patients with troglitazone
therapy did not reach statistical significance (baseline 258 ±
13, after troglitazone 239 ± 14 µmol/l; 0.05 < p < 0.1). plasma
fructosamine levels did not change with troglitazone therapy
in either normal control group.
plasma insulin and lipid levels. plasma insulin levels after
an overnight fast were significantly higher in the obese and
type 2 diabetic patients than in the lean control subjects
(both p < 0.001) but were not significantly different between
the diabetic and obese subjects (table 2). fasting insulin levels were lower after troglitazone in the diabetic (p < 0.05) and
obese (p < 0.02) subjects but were unchanged in the lean normal subjects (table 2).
plasma triglyceride levels were higher in the type 2 diabetic
patients than in the lean control subjects (p < 0.005)
(table 2), as were plasma nefas (p < 0.001). total cholesterol
did not differ between the groups, but hdl cholesterol was
lower in both the diabetic and obese subjects than in the
lean control subjects (table 2). troglitazone therapy in the diabetic patients was associated with a decrease in plasma
triglyceride and nefa levels (p < 0.05 and p < 0.02 vs. baseline, respectively) and an increase in hdl cholesterol (p <
0.005) (table 2). a small reduction in triglyceride levels was
also noted in the obese subjects (p < 0.05). no significant
change in any of the other lipid variables occurred in the
obese or lean normal subjects given troglitazone (table 2).
the extent of suppression of plasma nefa levels in the diabetic patients correlated with the improvement in glycemic
control as reflected by the reductions in fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.55, p < 0.05) and plasma fructosamine (r = 0.60,
p < 0.05) levels.
insulin sensitivity. mean plasma insulin levels during the
last 40 min of the glucose clamps were similar before and after
troglitazone and did not differ between groups (baseline:
lean 130 ± 10, obese 128 ± 7, diabetic 139 ± 7 mu/l; after troglitazone: lean 122 ± 8, obese 125 ± 7, diabetic, 120 ± 5 mu/l).
rd during the last 40 min of the first euglycemic clamps was
lower in the type 2 diabetic patients (3.76 ± 0.40 mg · kg–1 ·
min–1) than in the lean (11.14 ± 0.47 mg · kg–1 · min–1) or
obese (7.15 ± 0.66 mg · kg–1 · min–1) subjects (p < 0.001 for
both). rd during the last 40 min of the clamp was significantly increased after 3 months troglitazone therapy comdiabetes, vol. 49, april 2000

pared with baseline in both the type 2 diabetic patients
(5.25 ± 0.65 mg · kg–1 · min–1; p < 0.005) and obese subjects
(9.11 ± 0.79 mg · kg–1 · min–1; p < 0.005) but not in the lean subjects (baseline 11.14 ± 0.47, after troglitazone 10.61 ±
0.46mg · kg–1 · min–1). hepatic glucose output (hgo) was suppressed completely during the last 40 min of the clamp in the
lean control subjects (0.01 ± 0.13) and obese subjects (0.15 ±
0.19 mg · kg–1 · min–1); it was a little higher in the diabetic
patients (0.42 ± 0.11 mg · kg–1 · min–1; p < 0.05 vs. lean control
subjects). troglitazone had no significant effect on hgo during the glucose clamps in any of the groups.
plasma pai-1 and tpa antigen levels and activity.
plasma pai-1 antigen levels after an overnight fast (fig. 1)
were higher in the obese (33.5 ± 4.7 µg/l) and type 2 diabetic
(54.9 ± 6.3 µg/l) subjects than in the lean control subjects
(16.3 ± 3.2 µg/l; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) and
higher in the diabetic than the obese subjects (p < 0.05).
plasma pai-1 activity showed a similar pattern: the diabetic
patients had markedly increased plasma pai-1 activity in
comparison with the lean normal subjects, whereas plasma
pai-1 activity in the obese subjects was intermediate (fig. 1).
when the lean and obese groups were combined, plasma
pai-1 antigen levels correlated with bmi (r = 0.69, p < 0.001),
the common logarithm of fasting insulin levels (r = 0.68, p <
0.001), and fasting plasma nefa levels (r = 0.44, p < 0.05)
(fig. 2) but not significantly with the logarithm of fasting
plasma triglyceride levels (r = 0.34, ns) or insulin sensitivity
(rd at the end of the glucose clamps) (r = –0.41, ns). in the
diabetic patients, pai-1 antigen correlated with bmi (r = 0.72,
p < 0.005) but not significantly with fasting plasma insulin levels (r = 0.43, ns), plasma lipids, or insulin sensitivity (r = –0.28,
ns) (fig. 2) and was unrelated to baseline measures of
glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose, r = 0.28; hba1c, r =
0.10; fructosamine, r = 0.23, all ns).
plasma tpa antigen concentrations were higher in obese
(10.6 ± 1.0 µg/l) and type 2 diabetic (12.7 ± 0.4 µg/l) subjects than
in lean control subjects (5.8 ± 0.8 µg/l) (p < 0.001 for both) but
not significantly different between the obese and diabetic
groups (fig. 1). troglitazone therapy in the diabetic patients led
to a significant decrease in both plasma pai-1 antigen (54.9 ±
6.3 to 36.8 ± 5.0 µg/l; p < 0.001) and pai-1 activity (43.5 / 1.20
to 26.0 / 1.18; p < 0.005). in two of the diabetic patients, basal
pai-1 antigen concentrations showed either no change or
increased by 18 µg/l following troglitazone therapy. these two
patients may be regarded as nonresponders to troglitazone in

that their serum fructosamine levels increased by 37 and 33
µmol/l, respectively, their insulin sensitivity decreased by
~10%, and their fasting plasma insulin levels increased by 4 and
11 mu/l, respectively, compared with values at baseline. in
the obese subjects, the reduction in pai-1 antigen and activity
with troglitazone did not reach statistical significance (pai-1
antigen: 33.5 ± 4.7 to 25.6 ± 5.2 µg/l, pai-1 activity: 19.2 / 1.53
to 10.4 / 1.66 au/ml). this was due primarily to relatively
large increments in both of these variables in one subject in this
group. no change in either pai-1 antigen concentration or
pai-1 activity was seen with troglitazone therapy in the lean normal subjects (fig. 1). fasting plasma tpa antigen concentration
decreased with troglitazone therapy in both the diabetic and
obese subjects (fig. 1, both p < 0.001). however, from a stoichiometric point of view, the changes in pai-1 were much
more marked than those in tpa.
the decrease in plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations and
activity in the diabetic patients after troglitazone correlated
with the reduction in fasting plasma insulin levels (pai-1
antigen, r = 0.60, p < 0.05; pai-1 activity, r = 0.67, p < 0.01).
these relationships also held when the diabetic and obese
groups were combined (pai-1 antigen, r = 0.58, p < 0.005;
636

pai-1 activity, r = 0.60, p < 0.002). the extent of the fall in basal
pai-1 antigen levels with troglitazone therapy in the diabetic
patients also correlated with the extent of reduction of fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.64, p < 0.02) and fructosamine (r =
0.61, p < 0.02) levels and with the fall in plasma nefa levels
(r = 0.63, p < 0.02), but not with the reduction in plasma
triglyceride concentration or improvement in insulin sensitivity. although after troglitazone therapy plasma pai-1 antigen levels were not significantly correlated with the logarithm of the fasting plasma triglyceride levels, in either the
obese (r = 0.62, 0.05 < p < 0.10) or diabetic (r = 0.23, ns) subjects, plasma tpa levels were in both the obese (r = 0.75, p <
0.02) and diabetic (r = 0.59, p < 0.05) subjects.
effect of acute hyperinsulinemia with and without
troglitazone on plasma pai-1 and tpa levels. in the diabetic patients studied before troglitazone therapy, pai antigen
concentrations were lower at the end of the 5-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (38.9 ± 6.1 µg/l) than in the basal
state (53.6 ± 5.4 µg/l; p < 0.05). there was a corresponding
reduction in plasma pai-1 activity (42.4 / 1.22 to 9.6 /
1.47 au/ml; p < 0.001), but the small reduction in plasma tpa
antigen levels was not statistically significant (12.06 ± 0.50 to
11.13 ± 0.55 µg/l; ns). plasma pai-1 antigen and activity also
fell during the glucose clamps in the 12 normal subjects (6 lean
and 6 obese) in whom these measurements were made at the
end of the glucose clamps (pai-1 antigen, 26.0 ± 3.4 to 17.1 ±
2.9, p < 0.05; pai-1 activity, 8.7 / 1.55 to 1.5 / 1.48
au/ml; p < 0.001) (fig. 3). plasma tpa antigen, however, was
not significantly different in the normal subjects at the end of
glucose clamps (8.3 ± 1.2 µg/l) compared with basal levels
(8.9 ± 1.2 µg/l). whereas troglitazone lowered the basal pai-1
antigen and activity levels in the type 2 diabetic and obese normal subjects, it did not influence the response to the glucose
clamps in either the diabetic or normal subjects. thus,
plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations and activities at the end
of the glucose clamps were very similar before and after
treatment with troglitazone (fig. 3).
discussion

low plasma fibrinolytic activity in association with increased
plasma pai-1 levels has been linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis in obese subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes (4,5,14). in keeping with results in previous studies,
plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations and activity were
markedly increased in the diabetic patients we studied and to
a lesser extent in the obese nondiabetic subjects (fig. 1).
consistent with results from others (4,6–10), we found that
pai-1 levels in the nondiabetic subjects correlated with a
number of variables that cosegregate in subjects with the
insulin resistance syndrome, including bmi, fasting plasma
insulin, and nefa levels (fig. 2). a positive correlation
between plasma pai-1 levels and bmi was found also in the
diabetic patients (fig. 2).
the suggestion that chronic hyperinsulinemia in association with insulin resistance is the primary determinant of
elevated plasma pai-1 levels in obesity and type 2 diabetes
(4,6,9) prompted us to examine the influence of treatment
with troglitazone in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects on
plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations and activity. as
expected, troglitazone improved peripheral tissue insulin
sensitivity and lowered fasting plasma insulin levels in both
the type 2 diabetic patients and insulin-resistant obese nondiabetes, vol. 49, april 2000

nefa levels (c) and fasting plasma triglyceride levels (log scale) (d) in 10 lean normal subjects ( ), 10 obese subjects ( ), and 14 type 2
diabetic patients ( ). in the 20 nondiabetic subjects (- - -), pai-1 antigen was directly correlated with bmi (r = 0.69, p < 0.001), fasting insulin
(r = 0.68, p < 0.001), and fasting nefas (r = 0.44, p < 0.05). in the diabetic patients, pai-1 antigen correlated with bmi (r = 0.72, p < 0.005).
for all three groups combined (—), pai-1 antigen correlated with bmi (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), fasting plasma nefas (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), and
the common logarithms of fasting plasma insulin (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) and triglyceride levels (r = 0.38, p < 0.05).

diabetic subjects (table 2). in the diabetic patients, a 20%
reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels and a decrease in
fasting plasma nefa and triglyceride levels (table 2) were
seen. plasma pai-1 antigen and activity in the diabetic
patients after an overnight fast decreased by 33 and 40%,
respectively, after 3 months of treatment with troglitazone
compared with baseline values (fig. 1). plasma pai-1 antigen
and activity tended to fall as well in the obese nondiabetic subjects. the response in this group did not, however, reach statistical significance (0.1 < p < 0.05 for pai-1 antigen).
the increased plasma pai-1 antigen concentrations in the
diabetic and obese subjects were accompanied by increased
plasma tpa antigen. the latter decreased after troglitazone in
both the obese subjects and type 2 diabetic patients (fig. 1).
tpa antigen circulates in blood largely bound to pai-1. as
pai-1 levels increase, a higher proportion of tpa is com-

a

plexed with pai-1. the enzymatically inactive pai-1/tpa complexes are cleared more slowly than active, free tpa so that
total plasma tpa levels increase along with those of pai-1,
even though tpa activity falls (39). thus, tpa antigen concentrations are paradoxically inversely related to fibrinolytic
system activity (39). when plasma pai-1 levels decrease, the
clearance of tpa antigen is increased. this may explain the
fall in tpa antigen concentrations we observed after troglitazone. in type 2 diabetic patients treated intensively with continuous subcutaneous insulin, a similar reduction in tpa antigen levels accompanied the reduction in pai-1 levels (10).
glycemic control is generally not considered to be an
important determinant of plasma pai-1 concentrations
(4,10,30,40). the lack of any relationship between plasma
pai-1 antigen and activity levels and parameters of glycemic
control in the diabetic patients at baseline would support

effects of troglitazone on pai-1

this view. however, we did find that the decrease in pai-1 antigen levels with troglitazone (fig. 1) correlated with both the
extent of the fall in fasting plasma glucose concentration
(r = 0.64, p < 0.02) and the reduction in plasma fructosamine
levels (r = 0.61, p < 0.02). the extent to which plasma pai-1
antigen levels and activity were lowered after troglitazone in
the diabetic patients studied is comparable to that seen with
intensive insulin therapy (10), even though the improvement
in glycemic control in our diabetic patients was rather modest. this finding suggests that factors other than glycemic control play a role. improved glycemic control in the diabetic
patients was accompanied by lower plasma nefa levels and
an improved lipid profile, raising the possibility that the
reduction in lipid levels was a more proximate determinant
of the decline in plasma pai-1 antigen levels and activity.
indeed, the improvements in glycemic control and plasma
nefa levels were directly related, and the decline in plasma
nefa levels was found also to correlate with the reduction
in plasma pai-1 antigen levels (r = 0.63, p < 0.02). although
troglitazone led to a significant reduction in fasting plasma
triglyceride and increased hdl cholesterol levels in our subjects, none of these changes correlated with the reduction in
pai-1 antigen and activity levels.
consistent with a role for chronic hyperinsulinemia as a
determinant of the elevated plasma pai-1, we found that the
decline in plasma pai-1 antigen and activity with troglitazone was correlated with the extent of reduction in fasting
insulin levels in the diabetic patients (pai-1 antigen, r = 0.60,
p < 0.05; pai-1 activity, r = 0.67, p < 0.01). these relationships
also held in the diabetic and obese groups combined (r = 0.58,
p < 0.005, and r = 0.60, p < 0.002, respectively). our obese subjects had much lower fasting insulin levels than the obese
women with the polycystic ovary syndrome studied by
ehrmann et al. (41), which probably explains why troglitazone, which lowered fasting insulin levels by 66% in these
women, induced a more marked reduction in plasma pai-1
antigen levels and activity than in our obese subjects. our findings in the diabetic patients differ from those of sironi et al.
(42), who found no effect of 8 weeks troglitazone therapy on
plasma pai-1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. this difference is most likely due to their use of only 200 mg/day of
troglitazone, which had no significant effect on fasting
plasma insulin levels (42). the shorter duration of therapy
may also have been a factor, since the maximal insulinsparing effect of troglitazone may not be attained until
3–4 months of treatment (43).
the relative contributions made by the liver, adipose tissue,
and vascular endothelium to circulating pai-1 levels is
unclear. several studies have suggested that adipose tissue may
be an important source and play a role in the elevated pai-1
levels found in obesity and type 2 diabetes (19,20). increased
pai-1 mrna expression was found in subcutaneous adipose
tissue from obese and type 2 diabetic patients (20).
earlier studies suggested that visceral fat was particularly
important (19,44), with pai-1 production rates being higher
in visceral than subcutaneous adipocytes (19). however,
because subcutaneous adipocytes make a greater contribution to total fat mass, it is likely that both visceral and subcutaneous fat depots are important sources of circulating
pai-1. in addition to increasing skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, troglitazone has profound effects on adipose tissue
gene expression and metabolism (25,31,32). it was therefore
638

of interest to examine the influence of troglitazone on the
pai-1 response to acute hyperinsulinemia. consistent with
results in previous studies (21,23,24), pai-1 levels tended to
fall during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in the normal subjects and more strikingly in the diabetic patients with
elevated basal pai-1 levels. plasma pai-1 levels undergo a diurnal variation, with highest levels in the early morning and
lower levels in the afternoon (22,24,45,46). irrespective of
whether the fall in pai-1 levels during the glucose clamp was
a direct effect of insulin or in part due to this diurnal rhythm,
troglitazone did not influence the pai-1 response to the
clamps. thus, although basal pai-1 levels were lower after
3-month treatment with troglitazone, levels at the end of the
glucose clamps were unaffected (fig. 2).
it has been suggested that some of the beneficial effects of
troglitazone on cardiovascular risk factors may be independent of its insulin-sensitizing effects (25). our findings suggest
that the favorable effects on fibrinolytic system capacity are
linked intimately to increased insulin sensitivity for several
reasons. first, the reductions in plasma pai-1 levels were
related directly to reductions in plasma insulin, nefa, and glucose levels. second, the two diabetic patients in whom
glycemic control deteriorated, as evidenced by large
increases in serum fructosamine levels along with a small
reduction in insulin sensitivity and increase in fasting insulin
levels, exhibited either no change or an increase in plasma
pai-1. this suggests that nonresponders to troglitazone with
respect to insulin sensitivity and glycemic control are likely
to be nonresponders also with respect to improvement in fibrinolytic system capacity.
in conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate
that treatment with troglitazone enhances otherwise
markedly inhibited fibrinolytic system impairment in insulinresistant obese subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes by
enhancing insulin sensitivity.
