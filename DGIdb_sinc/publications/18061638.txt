introduction

progestins are a class of compounds that activate the  xxxg1737xxx , which plays a key role in female reproduction.
progestins have been used in a variety of gynecological disorders including endometriosis [1]. the major clinical effects
of progestins in humans are to transform the endometrium

into decidua and to inhibit ovulation. today, a wide variety of
progestins is available, ranging from those chemically derived
from progesterone and its counterpart retroprogesterone
to 19-nortestosterone derivatives [2,3]. medroxyprogesterone
acetate,  xxxd1957xxx , and  xxxd2751xxx  are representative derivatives of 17␣-hydroxy-progesterone, retroprogesterone, and 19-nortestosterone, respectively. as the adverse

s t e r o i d s 7 3 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 222–231

effect in the clinical use of progestins is related to their androgenic action, progestins without androgenic activity have been
developed recently [4–6].
dienogest, which is classiﬁed as a 4th generation progestin
based on its high speciﬁcity for the  xxxg1737xxx 
[7,8], has strong oral endometrial activity with no androgenic
activity [9–11]. dienogest is a so-called hybrid progestin, as
it has the chemical structure of 19-nortestosterone derivatives but also has characteristics of progesterone derivatives,
such as anti-androgenic activity [2]. dienogest has been tested
for the treatment of endometriosis in clinical trials. the
drug (2 mg/day) effectively diminished pain and endometriotic lesions with good tolerability [12], and was as effective as
 xxxd3445xxx  after laparoscopic surgery [13]. furthermore, a high
dose of dienogest (20 or 30 mg/day) was effective even against
stage iv endometriosis, and its side effects seemed to be favorable compared with those of other treatments [14]. dienogest
would be a good candidate for a medication of endometriosis,
of which the recurrence rate is high [15], because long-term
usage of gnrh analogues and  xxxd1806xxx  for the disease is contraindicated.
while the usefulness of dienogest in clinical practice has
been proven, there are still some gaps in our understanding
of its pharmacological proﬁle, which has been determined
largely through classical binding experiments and biological
assays [11,16–19]. from these data, the strong oral potency
of dienogest with respect to its endometrial activity is not
simply explained by its plasma concentration and binding
afﬁnity for the  xxxg1737xxx . whereas binding studies do not allow assessment of agonistic/antagonistic activity
or potency, the transactivation assay is reliable and able to
clarify the ambiguity of the binding assay by providing agonistic/antagonistic activity. although sobek et al. reported
transactivation activities of dienogest, their study was limited
to only in vitro activities of the drug toward progesterone and
glucocorticoid receptors [20]. therefore, there is a demand to
clarify the steroid  xxxg1603xxx  proﬁling of dienogest by
using this technique.
in this study, we investigated the hormonal activities of
dienogest by using the transactivation assay, and thereby
clariﬁed the agonistic/antagonistic activity and the potency
of the drug toward each steroid  xxxg1603xxx . we also
investigated the endometrial activity of dienogest and other
progestins in vivo and measured the plasma concentration
of the drugs in rabbits. then we attempted to explain in a
simple manner the strong endometrial activity of dienogest
in terms of its in vitro activities and its plasma concentration
in comparison with those of other progestins.

transfection and reporter gene assays

cos-1 cells were maintained in dmem medium supplemented with 10% fbs, penicillin (100 u/ml), and streptomycin
(100 ␮g/ml). the cells were harvested and suspended with
phenol red free-dmem medium supplemented with 10%
dcc-fbs, l-glutamine (4 mmol/l), penicillin (100 u/ml), and
streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml). for transient transfection, 1,500,000
cells were inoculated in a t75 ﬂask, and cultured overnight.

fig. 1 – structural formulae of dienogest, progesterone,  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2554xxx ,  xxxd1957xxx , and
 xxxd1806xxx . the molecular weight (mw) of each compound is also indicated below its structure.

the next day, a transfection mixture (expression vectors,
reporter vectors, and transit-cos reagent in opti-mem) was
added to the culture medium. after the cells had been incubated for 4 h, the medium was removed. the cells were then
washed with pbs and detached by use of trypsin-edta. they
were subsequently washed and suspended in assay medium,
and plated into a 96-well plate at a density of 5000 cells (100 ␮l)
per well. drugs dissolved in the assay medium (100 ␮l) were
added into each well immediately. to determine antagonistic
activity toward ar, gr, and mr, we added dht (10 nmol/l), dex
(10 nmol/l), and aldosterone (1 nmol/l), respectively. all assays
were performed in quadruplicate. the cells were incubated at
37 ◦ c in 95% air/5% co2 . after 18 h of incubation, the medium
were removed and the induced luciferase activity was measured by using a dual-glo luciferase assay system according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. relative luciferase unit (rlu)
was calculated by dividing the ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity by the
renilla luciferase activity in each well. all drug activities were
calculated by setting the maximum activity of the positive
control as 100% and the negative control as 0%. the competitor
concentration required for 50% activation or inhibition (ec50 )
was calculated by using linear regression.

2.4.

shbg and cbg binding

the shbg and cbg binding were measured by using a solidphase method [32]. shbg was absorbed onto a solid-phase
matrix of con a-sepharose over a 30-min incubation period
at room temperature. the ﬁnal concentration of shbg was
0.135 ␮g/ml of 30% (v/v) slurry of con a-sepharose in pbs.
aliquots (200 ␮l) of the shbg were incubated with 1 nmol/l 3 h-

testosterone together with various concentrations of the drugs
in duplicate. after 2 h of incubation at 37 ◦ c, the mixture was
ﬁltered through a glass ﬁlter to trap the radioligand bound to
shbg absorbed to con a-sepharose. the ﬁlter was washed
with cold pbs, and then the radioactivity was measured.
the cbg was likewise absorbed onto a solid-phase matrix
of con a-sepharose over a 30-min incubation period at room
temperature. the ﬁnal concentration of cbg was 0.280 ␮g/ml
of 30% (v/v) slurry of con a-sepharose in pbs. aliquots (200 ␮l)
of the cbg were incubated with 1 nmol/l 3 h-hydrocortisone
and various concentrations of drugs in duplicate. after 2 h of
incubation at 37 ◦ c, the mixture was ﬁltered through a glass
ﬁlter to trap the radioligand bound to the cbg absorbed on the
con a-sepharose. the ﬁlter was washed with cold pbs, after
which the radioactivity was measured.
concentrations of the drugs required for 50% displacement of the radioligand (ic50 ) were calculated by using linear
regression. relative binding afﬁnity (rba%) was calculated as
a percentile of the ic50 value of the positive control to that of
each drug.

2.5.

mcphail test in rabbits

the procedure used was a modiﬁcation of the method of
mcphail [33]. in brief, immature 7-week-old female rabbits
of the new zealand white strain (slc-nzw, japan slc inc.,
hamamatsu, japan) were used. the animals were injected
subcutaneously with 5 ␮g/kg of  xxxd2038xxx  in sesame
oil for 6 days. starting on the 7th day, the animals were
treated with progestins orally or progesterone subcutaneously
for 5 days (4 animals/group). progestins were suspended in
0.5% carboxymethylcellulose solution, and progesterone was

expression vector of each steroid  xxxg1603xxx  and a common luciferase reporter vector, pre2-tk-luc. progesterone
(p4), dienogest,  xxxd1957xxx  (dyg),  xxxd2751xxx  (nes),  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa), and  xxxd1806xxx  were added
to the medium, and cells were then incubated for 18 h. progesterone (p4), dihydro-testosterone (dht), or dexamethasone
(dex) was used as a positive control for each receptor. the percent activity was calculated by setting the maximum activity
of positive control as 100% and the activity of negative control as 0%. each point represents the mean ± s.d. of the percent
activity (four wells).

dissolved in sesame oil. on day 12, the animals were exsanguinated to death under anesthesia with pentobarbital. the
uteri were excised, and both the uterine horns were ﬁxed
with 10% buffered formalin. three portions of each horn were
dissected, embedded in parafﬁn, and were processed for standard hematoxylin–eosin staining. the six uterine sections per
animal were graded for the degree of endometrial transformation according to mcphail’s score. ed50 values for each drug
were determined as the dose required to induce endometrial change with a mcphail score of 2. on the last day of the
treatment, heparinized blood sample was collected from the
auricular vein 1 h after dosing. this time was chosen because
the concentration of drugs tested reached nearly their maximum at this time in a preliminary test. all the procedures were
approved by the laboratory animal committee of mochida
pharmaceutical.

2.6.
measurement of drug concentration in rabbit
plasma
progestins were extracted from plasma by using waters seppak vac  xxxg1857xxx  cartridges (waters, milford, ma). in brief, a
known amount of internal standard and pbs were added to
the plasma samples. the samples were applied to the cartridges preconditioned with methanol and water, and the
cartridges were washed with pbs, water, 20% acetonitrile,
and 70% methanol. progestins were eluted with acetonitrile,
and the eluants were evaporated to dryness. the residues
were dissolved in acetonitrile-water (4:6–6:4) and then injected
into a lc-ms-ms apparatus equipped with capcell pak c18
mg ii (3.0 mm × 75 mm; shiseido, tokyo, japan) for analysis.
a mobile phase gradient consisting of 5 mmol/l ammonium
acetate-acetonitrile was delivered at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml/min.

presence of active ligands, dihydrotestosterone (10 nmol/l) or aldosterone (1 nmol/l), respectively, as assessed by the
transactivation assay. cos-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression vector of each steroid  xxxg1603xxx  and
a common luciferase reporter vector, pre2-tk-luc. progesterone (p4), dienogest,  xxxd1957xxx  (dyg),  xxxd2751xxx  (nes),
 xxxd2554xxx  (mpa), and  xxxd1806xxx  were added, and cells were then incubated for 18 h. 4-hydroxyﬂutamide
(oh-ftd) and spironolactone was used as positive controls for ar and mr, respectively. the percent activity was calculated
by setting the activity when active ligand was added as 100% and the activity without active ligand as 0%. each point
represents the mean ± s.d. of the percent activity (four wells).

calibration curves were obtained by spiking blank plasma
samples with known amounts of a progestin and an internal
standard.

 xxxd2554xxx  (mpa) orally for 5 days (n = 4).
on day 11, the plasma were collected from the auricular
vein of the rabbits. the plasma samples were processed for
determination of the drug concentration. each point
represents a plasma concentration of the drug against the
dose used. the plasma samples from rabbits treated with
mpa (0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg) or dyg (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg), which
did not contain detectable level of the drugs
(mpa < 0.008 ng/ml, dyg < 0.04 ng/ml), were excluded from
the ﬁgure.

progestational activity in rabbits

the results of the mcphail test are shown in fig. 5. by
oral treatment, dienogest showed the most potent endometrial transformation activity followed by mpa, and dyg. nes
showed only partial endometrial transformation activity at
the dose of 0.05 mg/kg. the ed50 value of dienogest was
0.0042 mg/kg, while those values of mpa and dyg were 0.074
and 1.9 mg/kg, respectively.
fig. 6 shows the plasma concentration of progestins plotted
against the doses of the drugs used. all the plasma samples
from rabbits treated dienogest, nes, and the highest doses

some of the plasma samples from rabbits treated with low
doses of mpa (0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg) or dyg (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg)
did not contain detectable drug levels (mpa < 0.008 ng/ml,
dyg < 0.04 ng/ml). the plasma concentration of dienogest
reached 0.98 ng/ml at the dose of 0.003 mg/kg, whereas that

discussion

dienogest has been introduced as a strong oral progestin
with anti-androgenic property. we have conﬁrmed this proﬁle further by using the transactivation assay on human pr,
ar, gr, mr, er␣, and er␤ in vitro and the mcphail test in
rabbits. dienogest activated pr with ec50 values of 3.4 or
10.5 nmol/l. the potency of dienogest for this activation was
about 1/10 that of progesterone and is in accordance with
the results of previous binding studies in rats, rabbits, and
humans [11,18]. dienogest did not activate ar, gr, mr, er␣
or er␤ at the concentration of 3 × 10−6 mol/l. dienogest inhibited ar-mediated transcription with ec50 values of 420.6 and
775.0 nmol/l, but did not affect gr- or mr-mediated transcription. progesterone and dyg showed hormonal proﬁles similar
to those of dienogest, but both drugs showed antagonistic
activity toward mr also. in addition to pr, mpa activated ar
and gr, and nes activated ar, er␣, and er␤ with preference to
er␣ over er␤.  xxxd1806xxx  showed activation of ar and pr, with
preference to ar over pr. from these results, dienogest was
the most speciﬁc pr agonist tested in the present study.
in clinical use, the androgenic action of progestins is
thought to be related to adverse effects such as acne, hirsutism, and body weight gain as well as unfavorable effects
on carbohydrate metabolism [34–36] and lipid metabolism
[37–39].  xxxd1806xxx  caused over 40% reduction of hdl [37,38] and
a slight increase (14%) in ldl [37]. mpa caused a 29% decrease
in hdl during treatment of endometriosis [39]. in a clinical trial for endometriosis, whereas nes caused a signiﬁcant
decrease in hdl (>20%) and increase in ldl (>10%), dienogest
caused no signiﬁcant changes (only about 5%) [10]. in addition, treatment with dienogest caused no changes in glucose
level [40]. these reports seem to be in good accordance with
the agonistic activities of these progestins toward ar in our
study. therefore, the concept that progestins without androgenic action are advantageous in tolerability and suitable for
long-term use seems to be valid. besides activating ar, mpa
activated gr. the activation of gr by mpa is hypothetically
connected to increased hemostasis [41] and bone loss [42]. our
ﬁnding that nes had stronger estrogenic action on er␣ than
on er␤ is consistent with the result by larrea et al. [43]. as
will be discussed later, the estrogenic action of nes seemed
to have interfered with its progestational action. although
dyg, net, mpa, and dienogest showed very weak or no antimineralocorticoid activity compared to progesterone, there
have been few reports indicating adverse effects on electrolyte
excretion or blood pressure by these progestins so far. the use-

s t e r o i d s 7 3 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 222–231

fulness of progestins with anti-mineralocorticoid activity are
largely limited to current use of oral contraceptive with an
estrogenic component [44].
shbg and cbg are the transporter proteins that carry
and reserve steroid hormones in the plasma. shbg preferentially binds to testosterone, and cbg preferentially binds
to cortisol [45]. these proteins modify the hormonal activity and the pharmacodynamics of these drugs. for instance,
 xxxd1806xxx , besides its intrinsic androgenic activity, also exhibits
androgenic action via binding to shbg by increasing free
testosterone [46–48]. some progestins are reported to bind
shbg, and their actions seem to be mitigated because of a
lowered free fraction level [49]. in our study,  xxxd1806xxx  and nes
showed mild afﬁnity for shbg, whereas other progestins, i.e.,
dienogest, dyg, and mpa, showed weak afﬁnity, with their
rbas being less than 1%. for cbg binding, only  xxxd1806xxx  bound
to cbg, its rba being 59.3%, whereas the rbas for progestins
were less than 1%. this result is consistent with the results of
ottosson et al. [50]. collectively, the hormonal activity as well
as the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1806xxx  and nes would be affected
by the transporter proteins, but not in the case of dienogest,
dyg, and mpa.
in the mcphail test, dienogest showed a strong oral
progestational activity, as reported previously [9,11]. determination of the plasma concentration of progestins showed that
dienogest showed higher plasma concentrations than those
of the other progestins with higher doses, indicating the high
oral availability of the drug. as we expected, the estimated
plasma concentrations of dienogest and mpa at the doses of
their ed50 values in the mcphail test were very close to their
ec50 values to activate pr. thus, in vivo activities of these two
drugs were simply explained by applying the results of the
transactivation study. on the contrary, the plasma concentration of dyg at the dose of its ed50 value was much lower than
its ec50 value to activate pr. the plasma concentration of nes
at the dose of 0.05 mg/kg was much higher than its ec50 value
to activate pr. the bioavailability of dyg is known to be poor
in human. the plasma concentration of dyg was below the
detection limit (<1 ng/ml), whereas its metabolite was about
10 ng/ml in women after oral treatment with 10 mg of dyg [51].
it is probable that some metabolites of dyg had contributed to
progestational activity in vivo. although the oral pharmacokinetic proﬁle of nes was better than that of mpa or dyg, nes
did not induce full endometrial transformation in rabbits. the
reason for this insufﬁcient activity of nes is not clear, but it is
likely at least that its estrogenic action contributed to its lower
progestational activity. this is probable because we found that
simultaneous treatment with estrogen inhibited the action
of progesterone in the mcphail test in our preliminary study
(data not shown). the oral administration of progestins might
deteriorate their progestational action because of poor oral
pharmacokinetics proﬁle or their non-speciﬁc activity toward
steroid hormone receptors. the oral activity of dienogest only
appealed strikingly strong when compared with that of the
other progestins tested in this present study.
the mcphail test in rabbits has been widely used for
assessment and screening of progestins, because it has been
thought to have a good correlation with progestational action
in humans. in the case of dienogest, the dose (0.01 mg/kg)
at which dienogest induced an almost full response in rab-

229

bits is comparable to the dose (0.45 mg/day, 6.3 mg/cycle) for
full endometrial transformation in humans [10]. although the
ec50 values (10.5–3.4 nmol/l) of dienogest for pr were rather
high compared with those of other progestins, the reported
plasma concentration of dienogest (33.3 ng/ml, 107 nmol/l) in
humans was high enough to activate pr when female volunteers were treated with 1 mg dienogest twice orally [49].
even at the endometrial transformation dose (0.45 mg/day),
dienogest seems to have reached an adequate concentration.
the transformation doses of mpa, nes, and dyg in humans
were reported to be 80, 100–150 mg, and 150 mg/cycle, respectively [1]. the potency of dienogest in humans is 13–24 times
stronger than that of other progestins. this is in good accordance with the results we obtained using rabbits. thus, it
seems that the strong endometrial action of dienogest in
humans may also be explained by its oral pharmacokinetic
proﬁle, as well as its hormonal speciﬁcity.
in conclusion, our present study showed that dienogest is
a speciﬁc pr agonist with anti-androgenic activity. the strong
oral endometrial activity of dienogest is simply explained by
its good oral pharmacokinetic proﬁle and its potency in the
transactivation assay.
