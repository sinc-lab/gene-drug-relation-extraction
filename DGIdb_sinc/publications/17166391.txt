[routine chemotherapeutic drug treatment effectiveness predictive molecules and chemotherapeutic drug selection].  drug selection, the key for chemotherapy, is one of the most difficult decision-making in clinic for the treatment of malignant tumors. how to choose is undetermined. here a new strategy--predictive molecule-targeted chemotherapy (pmtc)--is put forward to choose relatively sensitive chemotherapeutic drugs and to avoid relatively resistant traditional drugs according to the expression of predictive molecules in individual tumor tissue. for example, paclitaxel is regarded as a relatively sensitive drug and may be chosen for the tumors with high expression of p53, while it is predicted as relatively resistant drug and should be avoided for the tumors with high expression of p-glycoprotein (p-gp). here, we reviewed the predictive values of a variety of molecules, such as p53, p-gp, topoisomerase-1, topoisomerase-2, msi, brca-1,  xxxg724xxx , fanc, hmhl1/2,  xxxg725xxx , bcl-2,  xxxg682xxx -2, mgmt, dihydropyridine dehydrogenase (dpd),  xxxg2366xxx  (ts),  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ), ras, bax,  xxxg365xxx , tubulin proteins, and so on, for the efficacy of some traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, such as platinum, oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,  xxxd1796xxx , methotrexate, 5- xxxd2134xxx ,  xxxd2188xxx , vincristine,  xxxd3515xxx   xxxd3516xxx , paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan,  xxxd3401xxx , and so on.
