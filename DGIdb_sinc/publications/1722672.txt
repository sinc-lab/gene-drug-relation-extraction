abstract--carbonyl
reduction was investigated in cytosolic and microsomal fractions of human liver
using the ketone  xxxd2633xxx  as a substrate. the cytosolic enzyme has a stronger preference for nadph
over nadh than the microsomal enzyme: the former shows only 14% of the nadph-supported
activity while the latter exhibits 36% activity with nadh.  xxxd285xxx  and quercitrin, the classic
inhibitors of carbonyl reductases, do not affect  xxxd2633xxx  reduction in either fraction.  xxxd1875xxx  and
indomethacin, the specific inhibitors of nad(p)h: quinone-oxidoreductase and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, respectively, only slightly decreased metyrapol formation. in contrast, sa-dihydrotestosterone,
the active form of the androgen steroid testosterone, inhibited  xxxd2633xxx  reduction very strongly in
the microsomal fractions and is postulated to be the physiological substrate of the enzyme. this resembles
the situation in mouse liver [e. maser and k. j. netter, biochem pharmacol38: 3049-3054.19891 where
microsomal  xxxd2633xxx  reductase was inhibited by steroids and the purified enzyme was demonstrated
to mediate androsterone oxidation. immunoblot analysis revealed antigenic cross-reaction of antibodies
against the 34 kda  xxxd2633xxx  reductase from mouse liver microsomes with the homologous protein in
human liver microsomes pointing to structural homologies between the respective enzymes of the two
species. these results-together
with previous findings, which have shown that there exist functional
as well as structural relationships between microsomal mouse liver  xxxd2633xxx  reductase and 3~
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from pseudomonas testosteroni (e. maser, u. oppermann and k. j.
netter, eurj pharmacol183: 1366,199oj-suggest that  xxxd2633xxx  reduction in human liver microsomes
might be catalysed by a microsomal hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

metabolic
reduction
is an important
step in
the biotransformation
of carbonyl group bearing
substrates in many mammalian and non-mammalian
tissues [l, 21. xenobiotic aromatic and aliphatic
aldehydes and ketones are often reduced to the
corresponding
alcohols prior to their further
metabolism and elimination. in addition, endogenous
substances such as prostaglandins
[3], biogenic
amines [4] and steroids [5,6] were shown to undergo
this step of metabolic reduction. the enzymes
involved in carbonyl reduction are summarized in
the family of carbonyl reductases, otherwise named
aldo-keto reductases [7], and share common features
such as monomeric structure (30-40 kda), cytosolic
subcellular localization and a cosubstrate specificity
for nadph. despite overall similarities they can
be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity
and their sensitivity to various inhibitors. thus,
barbiturate-sensitive
aldehyde reductases and quercitrin-sensitive
ketone
reductases
have been
described
[2].
furthermore,
enzymes
like
nad(p)h:quinone-oxidoreductase
(ec 1.6.99.2),
dihydrodiol
dehydrogenase
( xxxg630xxx .20) and
hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenases
(3a-, 3/3-, 17/s-)
might be involved in the metabolism of carbonyl
compounds or, as has been supposed, might even
be identical to enzymes described previously as
carbonyl reductases [8-131.
however, the number of distinct reductases in a
tissue and whether or not they are the same as

similar enzymes in other tissues is of particular
relevance with regard to the search for the
physiological role of these enzymes.
in previous investigations it has been shown that
 xxxd2633xxx  serves as a good model substrate for
studying reductive carbonyl metabolism [ 14,151
because it is almost exclusively reduced at its ketone
function rather than being oxidized at the nitrogen
of the two pyridine rings which would lead to
 xxxd2633xxx  n-oxides [16]. it was demonstrated that
 xxxd2633xxx  reduction occurs in various permanent
cell lines in culture thus emphasizing the essentiality
of this metabolic pathway [17]. kahl [18] first
reported the enzymatic reduction of the cytochrome
p450 inhibitor to the corresponding alcohol metabolite metyrapol by rat liver microsomes. accordingly,
a membrane bound  xxxd2633xxx  reductase (34 kda)
was purified from mouse liver microsomes [ 141 and,
besides being characterized as  xxxg72xxx   xxxg73xxx   xxxg74xxx   xxxg75xxx   xxxg110xxx   xxxg111xxx   xxxg183xxx ,
was demonstrated as being involved in physiological
steroid metabolism
[19]. moreover,
structural
and functional homologies were found between
 xxxd2633xxx  reductase from mouse liver microsomes
and 3cu-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
from p.
tesfosteroni [20].
in this study the situation in human liver was of
interest. we characterized  xxxd2633xxx  reduction in
human liver cytosol and microsomes using different
cosubstrates
as well as diagnostic
inhibitors,
in particular sdihydrotestosterone,
to obtain
information on the enzymes which might be involved.
in addition we checked human liver  xxxd2633xxx 
reducing enzymes for immunological

materialsand methods
materials. human liver microsomes and cytosol
from both sexes were kindly supplied by 0. pelkonen
(oulu, finland). they had been derived from legal
medical biopsies or from the livers of individuals
post mortem.  xxxd2633xxx  was purchased from fluka
ag (buchs, switzerland). enzymatic tests were
performed using nadh, nadp+, nadph, g-6p and g-6-p-dh from boehringer
mannheim
(mannheim, f.r.g.). for hplc, acetonitrile of
hplc-grade from e. merck (darmstadt, f.r.g.)
was used. for inhibitor studies quercitrin and
 xxxd1875xxx  were purchased from roth (karlsruhe,
f.r.g.);
scu-dihydrotestosterone
from aldrich
chemie (steinheim, f.r.g.); indomethacin from
the sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo, u.s.a.)
and sodium  xxxd285xxx  from e. merck. low molecular
weight markers were obtained from biorad (munich,
f.r.g.);  xxxd3215xxx  (sds*) from
fluka;
acrylamide,
methylenebisacrylamide,
4chloro-1-naphthol
and h202 from e. merck;
nitrocellulose from schleicher & schuell (dassel,

anti-rabbit igg
antibodies from dakopatts (hamburg, f.r.g.). all
other chemicals used in the experiments were reagent
grade and were obtained from commercial suppliers.
preparation of subcellular fractions. samples of
human livers were received within less than 1 hr
after medical biopsy or death of the individual and
homogenized immediately in 4 vol. of 20 mm trishcl buffer ph 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose and
1 mm edta, using a glass-teflon potter-elvehjem
homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged at
600g for 10 min to sediment the nuclei and cell
debris. the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at
10,000 g to sediment mitochondria. the supernatant
at this stage was centrifuged at 170,ooog for 1 hr
to sediment microsomes, finally giving a clear
cytoplasmic supernatant.
cytosols were dialysed
against 1000 vol. of a 50 mm sodium phosphate
buffer ph 7.4, to eliminate physiologically occurring
pyridine nucleotides. the microsomal pellet was
resuspended in the homogenizing buffer, giving a
protein concentration of 20 mg/ml.

cytosolic fractions of five individual livers was carried
out with a discontinuous system as described by
laemmli [22] using 10% acrylamide in the separating

containing 15 ,ug protein of the respective fraction.
preparation of antisera. the purification of the
microsomal  xxxd2633xxx  reductase from mouse liver,
immunization of rabbits and preparation of antisera
were carried out as described previously [15].

protein saturated nitrocellulose sheets. antigenantibody complexes were detected by peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies specific for rabbit
igg (dilution 1: 1000). these complexes were
visualized by the peroxidase reaction (chloronaphthol
method) [24].
enzyme assay. assay of  xxxd2633xxx  reduction
was performed by preincubating 60 pl of the enzyme
solution in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.4.
for inhibitor studies, 5 pl of the respective inhibitor
were added to a final concentration
of 1 mm.
inhibitors which were not sufficiently soluble in
buffer were dissolved in ethanol or 0.03 m naoh.
control velocities were determined in the presence
of appropriate quantities of the solvents. after the
preincubation
period of 3 min the reaction was
started by adding 5 ,ul of  xxxd2633xxx 
(final
concentration 1 mm, found to be saturating) and 5 pl
of the respective cosubstrate (final concentrations:

mixing 15 pl of the reaction sample with 45 pl of
ice-cold acetonitrile. the samples were centrifuged
for 6 min at 8ooog in the cold and 20 pl of the
supernatant were taken for the determination

figure 1 illustrates the specific activity and the

exceeding those of the respective microsomes

however,
considerable reduction of  xxxd2633xxx  also occurs
with nadh. whereas in dialysed cytosol this
accounts for only 14% compared to that occurring
with nadph, it came up to 36% in the microsomal
fractions. this may indicate that nadh can serve
as an alternative electron donor for  xxxd2633xxx 
reduction at least in microsomes.

in rabbits against the 34 kda  xxxd2633xxx  reductase
from mouse liver microsomes cross-reacted specifically with the homologous protein in human liver
microsomes in the same molecular weight region
(fig. 4), and did this in the same way as with the
respective mouse enzyme against which they were
originally raised [15]. these common antigenic
determinants point to structural homologies between
the microsomal  xxxd2633xxx  reductases in mouse
and human liver.
no cross-reaction occurred with any protein of
the respective cytoplasmic fractions indicating the
absence of common antigenic determinants.

found in earlier studies [14], 3.6fold. however, concerning cosubstrate dependence,
mouse [14] and human liver  xxxd2633xxx  reductases
seem to be very similar: whereas metyrapol formation
in cytosol shows a strong preference for nadph
that in the microsomes obviously occurs with nadh
also.
carbonyl reducing enzymes are in principle
cytosolic, monomeric (30-40 kda), nadph-dependent oxidoreductases
and were originally subinto
barbiturate-sensitive
aldehyde
classified
reductases and quercitrin-sensitive ketone reductases
[2]. in addition to these classic carbonyl reductases
other enzymes like dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (ec
1.3.1.20), nad(p)h : quinone-oxidoreductase
(ec
1.6.99.2) and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3~,
3/l- and 17/i-) were described as being involved in
carbonyl reduction or as even being identical to
enzymes described previously as carbonyl reductases
[g-13]. investigations on the sensitivity of  xxxd2633xxx 
reducing enzymes to diagnostic inhibitors have
shown that in mouse liver microsomes  xxxd2633xxx 
is reduced by an  xxxg72xxx   xxxg73xxx   xxxg74xxx   xxxg75xxx   xxxg110xxx   xxxg111xxx   xxxg183xxx  [14] and in the
respective cytosol by a ketone reductase [15].
moreover, the microsomal enzyme was purified to
homogeneity, showing a molecular weight of 34 kda
1141.
in this study the enzyme activity in both fractions
is not affected by barbiturate
or quercitrin.

carbonyl reduction in human liver
accordingly, following the classic inhibitor subclassification of carbonyl reductases in human liver
 xxxd2633xxx  is neither reduced by  xxxg72xxx   xxxg73xxx   xxxg74xxx   xxxg75xxx   xxxg110xxx   xxxg111xxx   xxxg183xxx 
or by ketone reductase. in cytosol  xxxd1875xxx , the
potent
inhibitor
of nad(p)h : quinone-oxidoreductase [26], and indomethacin,
the inhibitor
of dihydrodiol
dehydrogenase
[lo], moderately
decreased metyrapol
formation,
pointing to a
possible participation of the respective enzymes in
this reaction.
in human liver microsomes part of the reduction
of  xxxd2633xxx  seems likewise to be mediated by
nad(p)h : quinone-oxidoreductase
because of a
considerable inhibition by  xxxd1875xxx  [26]. surprisingly, metyrapol formation in this fraction is strongly
inhibited by scr-dihydrotestosterone,
the active
form of the androgen steroid testosterone.
5~
dihydrotestosterone,
therefore,
might be the
physiological substrate for the microsomal  xxxd2633xxx  reductase. this would resemble the situation
in mouse liver where metyrapol formation via
microsomal  xxxg72xxx   xxxg73xxx   xxxg74xxx   xxxg75xxx   xxxg110xxx   xxxg111xxx   xxxg183xxx  was inhibited by
steroids, suggesting the enzyme to be involved in
physiological steroid metabolism
[ 141. this was
finally confirmed with purified  xxxd2633xxx  reductase
in the case of androsterone oxidation [19,20].
for estimating immunological and thus structural
homologies
between
mouse and human liver
microsomal
 xxxd2633xxx 
reductases,
polyclonal
antibodies were raised against the purified mouse
liver enzyme. applying the immunoblot technique
the antibodies cross-reacted with only one single
protein band of human liver microsomes corresponding to the mouse liver enzyme in the 34 kda
molecular weight region. these common antigenic
determinants point to structural homologies between
the microsomal  xxxd2633xxx  reductases of mouse
and human liver origin.
structural as well as functional
relationships
between 3cu-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from p.
testosteroni and  xxxd2633xxx 
reductase from mouse
liver microsomes were found in previous investigations [19,20] where it was demonstrated that the
enzymes share features such as substrate specificity
for the xenobiotic  xxxd2633xxx 
and the steroid
androsterone;
dual cosubstrate
specificity for
nadph and nadh;
and common antigenic
determinants as revealed by immunoblot analysis.
however, further work on the carbonyl reducing
enzymes,
particularly
comparative
biochemical
studies in connection with steroid metabolism, is
needed in order to understand fully the function of
these enzymes.
in conclusion,  xxxd2633xxx , the diagnostic cytochrome p450 inhibitor, is reduced at its ketone
function to the corresponding alcohol metabolite
metyrapol in human liver cytosol and microsomes.
the reaction is mediated by carbonyl reductases
which do not follow the classic inhibitor subclassification of this enzyme family. nadph is the
more potent cosubstrate in both fractions, although
considerable enzyme activity in microsomes occurs
also with nadh. in addition to the functional
resemblances concerning cosubstrate dependence
and substrate
specificity there also seem to
exist structural homologies between microsomal

s97

 xxxd2633xxx  reducing enzymes from mouse and
human liver, and sdihydrotestosterone
is postulated to be the physiological substrate of the
microsomal  xxxd2633xxx  reductase from human liver.
