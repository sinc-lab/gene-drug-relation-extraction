abstract
calcitonin-family receptors comprise  xxxg321xxx -like receptor (cl) or  xxxg321xxx  and receptor activity-modifying
protein (ramp) pairings. calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp)
receptors are cl/ xxxg1926xxx , whereas  xxxg80xxx  (am) receptors are cl/ xxxg1927xxx  (am1 receptor) or cl/ xxxg1928xxx  ( xxxg1928xxx ).
amylin (amy) receptors are ramp hetero-oligomers with the
 xxxg321xxx  ( xxxg157xxx , amy2, and  xxxg159xxx , respectively).
how ramps change g protein-coupled receptor pharmacology is not fully understood. we exploited sequence differences
between  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  to identify individual residues
capable of altering receptor pharmacology. alignment of human ramps revealed eight residues that are conserved in
 xxxg1927xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  but are different in  xxxg1926xxx . we hypothesized that residues in  xxxg1927xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx , but not  xxxg1926xxx , are
responsible for making cl/ xxxg1927xxx  and cl/ xxxg1928xxx  am receptors. using site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced individual

the calcitonin peptide family, in humans, comprises calcitonin, amylin (amy), two forms of calcitonin gene-related
peptide (cgrp; ␣ and ␤) and  xxxg80xxx  (am). a second
version of am, a 47-amino acid peptide named intermedin
(imd) or am2, has been identified more recently (fig. 1a)

 xxxg1928xxx  residues into  xxxg1926xxx  and vice versa in these eight
positions. mutant or wild-type ramps were transfected into
cos7 cells with cl or the insert-negative form of the calcitonin
receptor [ct(a)]. agonist-stimulated camp production and cellsurface expression of constructs were measured. position 74 in
 xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  was critical for determining am potency
and affinity, and phe93 in  xxxg1926xxx  was an important contributor
to ␣cgrp potency at cgrp receptors. mutant ramp/ct(a)
receptor complexes displayed different phenotypes. it is noteworthy that  xxxg1926xxx  s103n and w74e mutations led to enhanced ramy potency, probably related to increased cellsurface expression of these complexes. this differs from the
effect on cl-based receptors where expression was unchanged. targeted substitution has emphasized the importance of position 74 in  xxxg1926xxx / xxxg1928xxx  as a key determinant of
am pharmacology.

(roh et al., 2004; takei et al., 2004). calcitonin-peptide family receptors are composed of g protein-coupled receptors and
receptor activity-modifying proteins (ramps) (poyner et al.,
2002). for example, am receptors are heteromers of the
 xxxg321xxx -like receptor (cl) with  xxxg1927xxx  (am1 receptors) or  xxxg1928xxx  (am2 receptors).  xxxg320xxx  receptors are
formed from cl/ xxxg1926xxx  complexes. in contrast, amy receptors comprise the  xxxg321xxx  with individual ramps
to generate  xxxg157xxx , amy2, and  xxxg159xxx  receptor subtypes.
pharmacological profiles have been determined for most of
these receptor complexes in heterologous expression systems
(christopoulos et al., 1999; nagoshi et al., 2002; hay et al.,
2003, 2005; kuwasako et al., 2003a; bailey and hay, 2006).

qi et al.

understanding the binding mechanism of the cgrp antagonist, bibn4096bs, in which trp74 in  xxxg1926xxx  plays a key
role in the very high-affinity binding and selectivity of this
compound for human  xxxg320xxx  receptors (mallee et al., 2002;
hay et al., 2003, 2006b; bailey and hay, 2006; salvatore et
al., 2006).  xxxg1928xxx -based am2 receptors are relatively insensitive to bibn4096bs antagonism but can be made more
sensitive by mutating the native  xxxd2431xxx  at position 74
to tryptophan (e74w) (hay et al., 2006b). it is interesting
that the e74w  xxxg1928xxx  mutant also has another deviation
from wild-type (wt) in that am potency is reduced at the
e74w  xxxg1928xxx  (hay et al., 2006b). moreover, cgrp
interactions with this receptor were not changed, suggesting
that this substitution disrupts a natural interaction site for
am but not cgrp.
sequence alignment of human ramps reveals that  xxxg1927xxx 
also has  xxxd2431xxx  at the equivalent position (glu101) to
glu74 in  xxxg1928xxx  (fig. 1b). this suggests that  xxxd2431xxx  is
an important amino acid in am receptors at this position and
perhaps helps to confer the greater affinity for am that these
receptors have over the  xxxg320xxx  receptor. it is interesting that
there are another seven positions in the n termini of human
ramps that fit this pattern (i.e., are the same in  xxxg1927xxx  and
 xxxg1928xxx  but different in  xxxg1926xxx ) (fig. 1b). therefore, in this
study, we hypothesized that these residues may play a role in
defining  xxxg1926xxx /cl as a cgrp receptor and  xxxg1927xxx /cl or
 xxxg1928xxx /cl as an am receptor.

materials and methods
dna constructs. human cl with an n-terminal hemagglutinin
(ha) epitope tag (ha-cl), human  xxxg1926xxx  with an n-terminal myc
tag (mycramp1), and human ramps 2 and 3 were kindly provided
by steven m. foord (glaxosmithkline, stevenage, uk) and have
been described previously (mclatchie et al., 1998). ha-tagged human ha-ct(a) was the leucine polymorphic variant (pham et al.,
2004). we used mycramp1 because its behavior has been shown to
be equivalent to that of wt  xxxg1926xxx  (mclatchie et al., 1998). however, epitope-tagged  xxxg1928xxx  constructs have significant differences
from wt  xxxg1928xxx  (m. udawela, unpublished data), and therefore
untagged  xxxg1928xxx  was used in this study.

studies. for example,  xxxg1926xxx - and  xxxg1928xxx -based receptors
expressed with cl (i.e.,  xxxg320xxx  and am2 receptors) show
reverse pharmacology (cgrp ⬎ am or am ⬎ cgrp, respectively) (hay et al., 2006a). on the other hand, intermedin, in
particular the short form (40 amino acids, imds), did not
discriminate between the three ramp/cl complexes (roh
et al., 2004; hay et al., 2005). such observations raise interesting questions about the features of the ramps, receptors, and the peptides that are important for their respective
pharmacology.
the mechanism of peptide interactions has been studied in
the most detail at cl/ramp-based receptors. for these receptors, the long n termini of the proteins seemingly act in
concert to provide binding sites for cgrp and am (hilairet et
al., 2001). studies involving  xxxg1926xxx /2 chimeras or  xxxg1926xxx 
truncation/deletion mutants indicate that the ramp n terminus is the major determinant of receptor pharmacology
(fraser et al., 1999; zumpe et al., 2000; steiner et al., 2002;
fitzsimmons et al., 2003, udawela et al., 2006).
deletion mutants or chimeras of ramps implicate human
 xxxg1927xxx  residues 86 to 92 in high-affinity am binding; in
human  xxxg1928xxx , it is the homologous residues 59 to 65
(kuwasako et al., 2001). in  xxxg1926xxx , the equivalent residues
(59 – 65) are also needed for high-affinity interactions with
cgrp and am (kuwasako et al., 2003b). however, alanine
scans of these regions in  xxxg1927xxx  showed that no single
amino acid substitution caused a significant perturbation of
camp production. data from chimeric ramps suggested that
the main am binding epitope in  xxxg1927xxx  was located between
residues 77 and 101, but several deletion mutants within this
region gave poor cell-surface expression, precluding further
analysis. in human  xxxg1926xxx , residues 41 to 45, 59 to 65, 67 to
71, and 91 to 103 were needed for high-affinity cgrp interactions. deletion of residues 78 to 80 and 88 to 90 allowed
camp production by cgrp but not by am (kuwasako et al.,
2003b).
although the ramp n terminus is clearly a key determinant of pharmacological selectivity, it has not been confirmed
whether the ramp provides the appropriate conformation to
the receptor for peptide binding or whether it provides direct
points of contact. however, there has been some success in

this method has been described previously (hay et al., 2006b; bailey
and hay, 2007). all primers were custom-synthesized by invitrogen
(carlsbad, ca). primer sequences are available on request.
cell culture and transfection. culture of cos7 cells was performed essentially as described previously (bailey and hay, 2006).
cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem)
supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5%
v/v penicillin/streptomycin and kept in a 37°c humidified 95% air/5%
co2 incubator. cells were plated into 96-well plates (camp/elisa)
or 175-cm2 flasks ([125i]ham13–52 binding) 1 day before transfection.
cells were transiently transfected using polyethylenimine as described in detail in a previous publication (bailey and hay, 2006).
plasmid dna was 250 ng in total per well of each 96-well plate or
160 ␮g per flask and was incubated with polyethylenimine in 5%
glucose for approximately 10 min before being added to complete
growth medium. cells were used for experimentation 36 to 48 h
later. for [125i]ramy binding (selected mycramp1 mutants), camp
and antibody binding experiments of the mutants e74d/e74q/e74k
am2 and e101w am1 and appropriate wt controls, cos7 cell culture, and transfection were as described previously (hay et al., 2005,
2006b).

brief, transfected cells were serum-deprived in dmem containing 1
mm isobutyl methylxanthine and 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  for 30
min before the addition of agonists and incubation at 37°c for 15

2005, 2006b), where camp content was assayed by amplified luminescent proximity homogenous assay (alpha) screen.
cell-based elisa and [125i]igg binding. in most experiments, elisa was used to measure the cell-surface expression of
ha-cl or mycramp1, depending on the primary antibody used, to
measure the expression of  xxxg320xxx  and am2 or  xxxg157xxx (a) receptor
complexes, respectively. this method is a modified form of that
published by versteeg et al. (2000). our modifications have been
published previously (bailey and hay, 2007). the myc antibody
(calbiochem, san diego, ca) was used at a dilution of 1:250. values
were normalized to wt expression levels as 100%. for e74d/e74q/
e74k am2 and e101w am1 complexes, cell-surface expression was
assessed by detecting [125i]igg (goat anti-mouse) bound to the
n-terminal ha tag on cl (hay et al., 2005, 2006b).
[125i]ramy binding. [125i]ramy binding was performed to evaluate ramy affinity of selected mutant receptor complexes. [125i]ramy
binding was undertaken on whole cells in 48-well plates as described
previously (hay et al., 2005, 2006b). the only modification was that
cells in the presence of 100,000 cpm of [125i]ramy in each well with
or without unlabeled ramy were incubated for 45 min at 37°c in a
co2 incubator.
membrane preparation. membranes of cells transfected with
mutant ramps e74w/w74e with cl were harvested as described
previously (bailey and hay, 2007). the only modification was that a
1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail (p8340; sigma, st. louis,
mo) was added to the membrane harvest buffer. in brief, cells
transfected and grown in two t-175 cm2 flasks for each transfection
mix were removed using a cell scraper and combined. the dislodged
cells were homogenized and centrifuged. the pellet was resuspended
and rehomogenized. a small aliquot was retained for protein content
assay, and the remainder was frozen at ⫺80°c.
[125i]ham13–52 binding. [125i]ham13–52 binding was performed
on the membrane preparations described above in duplicate in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes (bio plas inc., san rafael, ca). a dilution
series of nonradiolabeled ham was prepared in binding buffer (20 mm
hepes, 5 mm mgcl2 䡠 6h2o, 5 mm kcl, 10 mm nacl, 1 mm edtadisodium, ph 7.4, and 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ), giving final concentrations ranging from 10⫺6 (nonspecific binding) to 10⫺13 m (mutant
w74e) or 10⫺11 m (mutant e74w). [125i]ham13–52 was diluted with
binding buffer to allow approximately 30,000 cpm in 50 ␮l (⬃9.1 pm).
membranes were thawed on ice and rehomogenized with a glass homogenizer if the membranes were not an even suspension. a 50-␮l
diluted radiolabel, 50-␮l appropriate unlabeled competitor from the
dilution series or buffer (total binding), and 76- to 100-␮g membranes
were added to each assay tube in this order. the mixture was vortexed
briefly and incubated at 4°c for 30 min. the membranes were pelleted
in a bench-top microcentrifuge at 4°c for 5 min. the supernatants were
carefully removed, and the pellets were washed once with 500 ␮l of
ice-cold binding buffer. pellets were counted for ␥ radiation for 1 min.
data analysis and statistical procedures. data were analyzed using graphpad prism (versions 4.02 or 5.01; graphpad software inc., san diego, ca). camp data generated from the radioreceptor assay were normalized to the response obtained to 50 ␮m
 xxxd1742xxx  that was present as a control on each plate. the quantity of
camp generated from the alpha screen was calculated from the
raw data using a camp standard curve. camp data from both assays
were fitted to obtain pec50 and emax values using a four-parameter
logistic equation. for statistical analysis, pec50 and emax values
were compared between wt and mutant receptors using unpaired t
tests. expression values were compared using one-way analysis of
variance (anova) followed by dunnett’s multiple comparison test.
[125i]ham13–52 binding data (in counts per minute) were first converted to femtomoles of radiolabel bound per milligram of membrane
protein; specific binding was calculated for each data point that was
then fitted to obtain pic50 values. the maximum specific binding (in
femtomoles per milligram) for mutant versus wt receptors were
compared by unpaired t test. [125i]ramy binding data (on whole cells)
were expressed as specific binding, which was normalized to the

to elucidate the importance of residues conserved in
 xxxg1927xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  but not  xxxg1926xxx , the divergent  xxxg1926xxx 
residues were individually incorporated into  xxxg1928xxx .
 xxxg1928xxx  mutants containing individual  xxxg1926xxx  residues with ha-cl. as reported previously, e74w am2
receptors demonstrated a selective 8-fold reduction in am
potency relative to wt with no effect on cgrp potency (table 1) (hay et al., 2006b). seven other mutants were generated, incorporating other individual  xxxg1926xxx  residues into
 xxxg1928xxx  (as per the sequence alignment shown in fig. 1b).
the a89v substitution led to enhanced am potency (⬃4-fold)
but no significant change in h␣cgrp potency (table 1). no
other changes in function with either ham or h␣cgrp (table
1) were observed with the remaining six mutants.
expression of  xxxg1928xxx  complexes was assessed by
measuring ha-cl at the cell surface. both cl and ramp are
required for efficient cell-surface transportation of cgrp
and am receptor complexes, and thus ha-cl can be used a
surrogate marker for the expression of am2 receptors
(mclatchie et al., 1998). there was no change in expression
with any of the mutants except for a small reduction in the
level of d46v am2 receptors (fig. 2).

ramy and h␤cgrp was observed for e74w, i93f, and n103s
 xxxg159xxx (a) receptors (table 2 and fig. 3). however, no other
significant changes in potency were observed for either peptide with the other mutant receptors (table 2). this contrasts
with the  xxxg1928xxx , in which altered am potency was
seen with the a89v mutant and no change was observed with
the i93f and n103s mutants.
mycramp1 mutants containing individual  xxxg1928xxx 
residues with ha-cl. we subsequently examined the reciprocal mutations, in which the  xxxg1927xxx /3 amino acids were
substituted into mycramp1.
mutants in this series displayed several interesting behaviors. first, w74e mycramp1, which is the converse mutation to e74w  xxxg1928xxx , showed selectively enhanced am potency when expressed with ha-cl, exactly the opposite and
of a similar magnitude (⬃6-fold) to the reduced am potency
at e74w  xxxg1928xxx  (table 3 and fig. 4a, w74e compared with
e74w data in table 1). h␣cgrp potency was unchanged at
this mutant (table 3, fig. 4b). h␤cgrp was also equipotent
at w74e mycramp1 and wt mycramp1 (pec50 ⫾ s.e.m.;
10.8 ⫾ 0.12 versus 10.9 ⫾ 0.08, respectively, n ⫽ 3). it is
interesting that this reciprocal behavior was not observed
with the other mutant in this series that had altered am
potency, the a89v mutant. however, f93i mycramp1 displayed a reduction in h␣cgrp potency (table 3 and fig. 4d)
in the absence of any significant change in am potency (table 3 and fig. 4c). a34e mycramp1 exhibited a small but
significant increase in h␣cgrp potency (table 3). no other
mutations led to measurable changes in am or h␣cgrp
activity. furthermore, cell-surface expression of mutant receptor complexes in this series was unaltered compared with
wt mycramp1/ha-cl (fig. 5).
mycramp1 mutants containing individual  xxxg1928xxx 
residues with ha-ct(a). assay of cells cotransfected with
mycramp1 mutants and ha-ct(a) revealed observations different from those identified with ha-cl. four mutants
showed statistically significant differences in peptide response to wt when transfected with this receptor. w74e and

mutant.
further investigation of the role of residues at position 74 in  xxxg1926xxx /3. given the importance of position 74
in  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  for determining am potency, we
further investigated the contribution of the residue at this
position to peptide interactions by assaying two additional
forms of am: am15–52 and imd. am15–52, a truncated agonist
that lacks the first 14 amino acids, was assayed at both
w74e  xxxg320xxx  and e74w am2 receptors. at w74e  xxxg320xxx 
receptors, this agonist displayed enhanced potency [pec50 ⫾

s103n mycramp1-based receptors displayed a small enhancement of ramy potency (2- to 4-fold) but no significant
change in h␤cgrp potency (table 4). in contrast, v89a and
f93i mycramp1-based receptors were stimulated with
lower potency than wt receptors by both ramy and h␤cgrp
(table 4 and fig. 6). this trend was also seen with the e88l
mutant; however, only the reduction in h␤cgrp potency
achieved significance. the greatest reduction in peptide potency was observed with the f93i mutant, where pec50
values for both agonists approached those obtained at hact(a) expressed alone (table 4). the v89a phenotype was
intermediate between ha-ct(a) alone and wt  xxxg157xxx (a).
the expression of wt and mutant  xxxg157xxx (a) receptor complexes was detected by measuring mycramp1 expression at
the cell surface. unlike the expression pattern observed
when mutants were coexpressed with ha-cl, significant
reductions in expression were demonstrated with a34e,
e88l, v89a, and f93i mutants (fig. 7). s103n and w74e
mycramp1 expression was higher than wt mycramp1
when expressed with ha-ct(a) (fig. 7).
the binding affinity of w74e/e88l/v89a/f93i  xxxg157xxx (a) receptor complexes was also compared with wt  xxxg157xxx (a) in
[125i]ramy binding experiments (fig. 9a and table 5). specific [125i]ramy binding was approximately 2-fold higher in
w74e  xxxg157xxx (a) receptor-transfected cells than wt  xxxg157xxx (a)transfected cells with no change in affinity. binding of
[125i]ramy was lower at v89a and f93i mutants, both of
which showed a marked loss in affinity. e88l  xxxg157xxx (a) recep-

residue in  xxxg1927xxx  at the equivalent position to 74 in
 xxxg1926xxx /3 (e101w) to study the possible role of the residue in
 xxxg1927xxx . the function of wt or e101w expressed with
ha-cl or ha-ct(a) was assessed by measuring camp in
response to different agonists.
this mutation showed a detrimental effect on receptor
function when expressed with ha-cl. in three of four independent transfections, there was no significant stimulation
of camp response to am (1 pm to 1 ␮m; data not shown). a
weak response was observed in the fourth experiment: wt
am1 receptors stimulated camp with a pec50 value of 8.23
(basal camp, 8.52 ⫾ 0.85 nm; emax, 22.8 ⫾ 1.08; s.e.m. from
three experimental replicates), whereas the pec50 at e101w
am1 receptors was 6.86 (basal camp, 7.40 ⫾ 1.07 nm, emax,
13.7 ⫾ 1.49; s.e.m. from three experimental replicates).
weak stimulation of camp was also seen with both ␣cgrp
and ␤cgrp at this mutant (data not shown).
cell-surface expression of e101w and wt am1 was measured by detecting antibody binding to ha-cl. the expression level of e101w am1 receptors was equivalent to the
expression of ha-cl without ramp (fig. 10), consistent
with the lack of am response in these cells.
with ha-ct(a), no significant difference in ramy, h␣cgrp,
or h␤cgrp potency was observed between mutant e101w and
wt. the data are as follows (pec50 ⫾ s.e.m.): ramy: wt,

in this study, we explored the hypothesis that residues
conserved between  xxxg1927xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  but that are different in  xxxg1926xxx  contribute to definition of the pharmacology of
these receptors. specifically, we expected that  xxxg1926xxx  residues incorporated into  xxxg1928xxx  could result in reduced am
potency and/or enhanced cgrp potency, whereas  xxxg1928xxx 
residues incorporated into  xxxg1926xxx  could lead to enhanced
am potency and/or decreased cgrp potency. however, only
one of the substituted residues elicited the expected behavior
on peptide potency, suggesting that a more complex interplay
between ramp and the cl receptor is required for the reconstitution of specific peptide responses.
the most striking observations for an individual residue
substitution were seen for residue 74 of ramps 1 and 3. as
we have reported previously,  xxxg1928xxx -based receptors that
contained an e74w substitution displayed a selective reduction in am potency that was not seen with cgrp peptides
(hay et al., 2006b), suggesting that this residue may play a
key role in am peptide interaction. consistent with this, the
reciprocal substitution of w74e in  xxxg1926xxx -based  xxxg320xxx 
receptors led to a corresponding increase in am potency. this
was further confirmed by [125i]ham13–52 binding, where the
amount and affinity of binding were both reduced at e74w

[125i]ham13–52 at the w74e  xxxg320xxx  mutant than at wt (fig.

7.22 ⫾ 0.28 (n ⫽ 5); mutant, 7.73 ⫾ 0.24 (n ⫽ 5)], although
this was not statistically significant.
the effect of substitutions of the native  xxxd2431xxx  at
position 74 in  xxxg1928xxx  to lysine (e74k),  xxxd233xxx  (e74d),
and glutamine (e74q) on am response has been reported
previously (hay et al., 2006b). e74d showed no significant
change in am potency, whereas both e74q and e74k led to
only a small but significant decrease in am potency. here we
report h␣cgrp potencies at these three mutants expressed
with ha-cl and their surface expression. consistent with
the response from e74w am2, h␣cgrp potency was not
significantly changed with any of these mutants [pec50 ⫾

w74e  xxxg320xxx  receptors. the data may suggest that imd has
a different mode of interaction with the two receptors.
previous substitutions of glu74 in  xxxg1928xxx  to  xxxd233xxx ,
glutamine, or lysine revealed weak reductions in am potency
for e74q and e74k mutations, whereas the e74d-based
receptor was not significantly different from wt-based am2
receptors (hay et al., 2006). nonetheless, the e74w mutation
had the greatest effect on am potency, leading us to speculate that the large aromatic tryptophan may sterically hinder
am interaction with the receptor complex but that the charge
of the residue plays relatively little direct role in am binding
(hay et al., 2006b). consistent with the lack of e74w effect
on cgrp response, no effect on cgrp potency was observed
for any of the other mutants. it is noteworthy that whereas
substitution of trp74 in  xxxg1926xxx  does not alter cgrp potency, it is clear that this residue plays a key role in the
affinity of the small-molecule antagonist bibn4096bs for
 xxxg320xxx  receptors (mallee et al., 2002; hay et al., 2006b). this
may imply that although it is not directly involved in cgrp
interaction, the residue is nonetheless in close proximity to
the cgrp binding pharmacophore.
the equivalent position to 74  xxxg1926xxx /3 in  xxxg1927xxx  (glu101)
was also important for  xxxg1927xxx /cl receptor function and expression. mutant e101w am1 receptors generated essentially
no response in camp experiments with either am, ␣cgrp, or
␤cgrp. this generalized perturbation in function is probably
the result of almost complete loss of cell-surface expression of
this mutant receptor complex. glu101 may be directly or indi-

am2 but enhanced at w74e  xxxg320xxx . the reciprocal nature of
this effect, in the absence of alteration to cgrp potency, is
indicative of a direct interaction of residue 74 with am.
the nature of this interaction was further explored
through the use of other am peptides, am15–52 and the more
distantly related imd (or am2). both of these peptides exhibited behavior similar to that of the full-length am. this
provides insight into the residues of am likely to be involved
in interaction with glu74, eliminating a role for the n-terminal 14 amino acids. imd has only limited sequence identity with am (approximately 30% between am15–52 and imd;
fig. 1a), but the mutations affected the potency of both
peptides in a similar manner. this suggests that the peptide
residues that are conserved are integral to the interaction
with these receptors. in cos7 cells, we reported that imds
displayed equal potency across all ramp/cl complexes (hay
et al., 2005). others have also suggested that imds and imd
are nonselective agonists of ramp/cl combinations (roh et
al., 2004; takei et al., 2004), initially suggesting that their
binding is not influenced by the divergent residues across
different ramps. the specific influence of alteration to residue 74 in the current study indicates that the nature of imd
interaction with the receptors is more complex than originally believed. it is interesting that we found a significant
difference in imd potency between  xxxg320xxx  and am2 receptors in this study. furthermore, the reduction in imd potency at e74w am2 receptors was of a smaller magnitude
than the increased potency observed with this peptide at

the a89v  xxxg1928xxx  mutant also displayed interesting behavior with an increase in am potency in the absence of any
change in cgrp potency or expression of the receptor complex. however, no change in am or cgrp potency was observed with its reciprocal  xxxg1926xxx  mutant v89a. although
inconsistent with our original hypothesis, it is possible that
introduction of the branched side chain of valine enabled
interaction with other residues in close proximity to  xxxg1928xxx ,
leading to enhanced am binding or a small conformational
effect on the receptor complex. on the other hand, loss of this
side chain in  xxxg1926xxx  is apparently not detrimental to am/
cgrp interactions at  xxxg320xxx  receptors.
in addition to  xxxg1926xxx  w74e, a second  xxxg1926xxx  mutant
that incorporated a  xxxg1928xxx  residue, f93i, also elicited interbound

esting pharmacology. in this case, a decrease in cgrp potency was observed in the absence of any change in am
potency, although there was no reciprocal increase in cgrp
potency in the i93f-substituted  xxxg1928xxx -based receptor. in a
previous study, phe93 mutation to alanine led to decreased
cgrp binding and expression in the absence of a change in
potency (kuwasako et al., 2003b). we have speculated that
this is likely to reflect a role for phe93 in the interface
between cl and  xxxg1926xxx  rather than a specific effect on
binding of cgrp (hay et al., 2006a). in the current study,
with f93i, we saw changes in potency but not expression
with cl. it is possible that the bulkier isoleucine substitution
allowed maintenance of the cl/ramp interaction but had a
smaller conformational effect on the receptor complex, leading to a small change in cgrp binding. however, further
work is required to define the precise role of phe93 in

qi et al.

the striking effect of many of the mutations within
mycramp1 on its translocation to the cell surface by ct(a) is
in stark contrast to the lack of effect of these mutations on
the interaction of the cl with mutant mycramp1 (figs. 7
versus 5). it is noteworthy that the interaction of cl and
ramp is stabilized by receptor component protein (prado et
al., 2001), and this additional interaction may overcome
small effects on the direct  xxxg1926xxx /cl interface. for the
 xxxg321xxx , this may not be the case, leading to more
marked effects on ramp/ct(a) complex stability. this would
be consistent with the f93i mutation having only a weak
effect on  xxxg1926xxx /cl stability, whereas the more dramatic
f93a (kuwasako et al., 2003b) mutation leads to destabilization of the complex. however, it is also possible that the
interface used by cl and calcitonin receptors is significantly
different, leading to differing outcomes of individual mutations on the stability of receptor complexes.
in this study, two ramp residues played an important role
across both cl- and ct(a)-based receptors, 74 (tryptophan or
 xxxd2431xxx ) and 93 (phenylalanine or isoleucine). we were
intrigued to find that a  xxxd2431xxx  is conserved at position
74 in all  xxxg1928xxx  sequences from 11 species (supplementary
fig. 3) and in 10 of 11 species at the equivalent position (101)
in the  xxxg1927xxx  sequences (supplementary fig. 2), indicating
that this residue is of fundamental importance to these proteins. likewise, phe93 in  xxxg1926xxx  is conserved in 14 species
(supplementary fig. 1), suggesting that the impact of mutation of this residue to isoleucine to reduce cgrp potency is a
genuine effect.
in conclusion, individual ramp residues differing between
 xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1927xxx / xxxg1928xxx  seem to play only a limited
direct role in delineating the specificity of am and cgrp
interaction with ramp/cl complexes; the most dramatic
effect is the importance of residue 74 in am binding. this
study also reveals important yet contrasting roles for individual amino acids in the formation of functional amy
receptors.

 xxxg1926xxx /cl  xxxg320xxx  receptors. there were no other major
differences with the remaining mutations in this series.
in addition to exploring the effect of these targeted substitutions in  xxxg1926xxx  and  xxxg1928xxx  with cl, we coexpressed
these mutants with ct(a). in the set of  xxxg1928xxx  mutants
containing individual  xxxg1926xxx  residues, parallel reductions
in potency were observed for ␤cgrp and ramy at e74w
 xxxg1928xxx , i93f  xxxg1928xxx , and n103s  xxxg1928xxx . the generalized
perturbations in function may be related to altered expression; however, direct assessment of this was not possible
because both cmyc- and ha-tagging of  xxxg1928xxx  alters its
behavior relative to wt  xxxg1928xxx  (m. udawela, unpublished
data).
in the series of mycramp1 mutants containing  xxxg1928xxx 
residues expressed with ct(a), there were several interesting
findings. the results of the mutations were mixed, with some
specific changes in agonist potency and some general effects,
probably related to receptor expression. w74e mycramp1
and n103s mycramp1 both led to enhanced ramy potency.
this was paralleled by increased cell-surface expression of
the mutant mycramp1. although not reaching statistical
significance, there was also a trend toward increased ␤cgrp
potency for these mutants, suggesting that the augmented
peptide potency most likely relates to higher cell-surface
expression of these mutant ramp/ct(a) complexes. w74e
 xxxg157xxx (a) ramy binding was increased in the absence of a
change in affinity, supporting this conclusion.
likewise, the loss of ramy and ␤cgrp potency with the
v89a and f93i mutants was paralleled by significant loss of
cell-surface expression of the mutant mycramp1s, with the
magnitude of effect on receptor expression being paralleled
by the severity of effect on potency. these observations at the
v89a and f93i mutants were consistent with [125i]ramy
binding data, in which reductions in both specific binding
and affinity were seen. the e88l  xxxg157xxx (a) receptor displayed
a small reduction in specific [125i]ramy binding but no
change in amy affinity, and this was consistent with the
minimal effect of this mutation on amy or ␤cgrp potency.
however, antibody binding to the e88l mycramp1 was
markedly attenuated, suggesting that recognition of the myc
epitope may have been altered with this mutation.
