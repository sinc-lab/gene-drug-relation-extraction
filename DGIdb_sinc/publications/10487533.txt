stimulation of  xxxg2312xxx -mediated dna cleavage by an indazole analogue of  xxxd2514xxx .   xxxd2514xxx  is an antitumour drug used as an adjuvant in radiation therapy. the drug intercalates into dna and inhibits  xxxg2312xxx . an indazole analogue of  xxxd2514xxx  (ia-5) was examined for its ability to modulate  xxxg2312xxx -dna cleavable complex formation in vitro. the drug contains a methylbenzothiopyranoindazole chromophore instead of the methyl-thioxanthenone nucleus of  xxxd2514xxx . using a radiolabelled linear plasmid dna as a substrate, both  xxxd2514xxx  and the indazole analogue were shown to promote the cleavage of dna by human  xxxg2312xxx . sequencing experiments with different restriction fragments indicated that the indazole drug promoted dna cleavage primarily at sites having a c on the 3' side of the cleaved bond (-1 position). by contrast, in the same sequencing methodology  xxxd2514xxx  exerted a much weaker effect on  xxxg2312xxx . the sequence selectivity of ia-5 is reminiscent of that of the anticancer drug mitoxantrone and its anthrapyrazole analogue losoxantrone, which is structurally close to ia-5. binding to dna and  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition are two distinct processes contributing separately to the cytotoxic activity of the indazole drug.
