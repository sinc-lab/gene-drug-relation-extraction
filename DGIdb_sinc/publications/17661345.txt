abstract
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido), a tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
various neurological disorders. ido expression is induced
by ifn-g and leads to neurotoxicity by generating quinolinic acid. additionally, it inhibits the immune response
through both tryptophan depletion and generating other
tryptophan catabolites. il-4 and il-13 have been shown to
control ido expression by antagonizing the effects of ifn-g
in different cell types. here, we investigated the effects of
these cytokines on ido expression in microglia. interestingly, we observed that both il-4 and il-13 greatly
enhanced ifn-g-induced ido expression. however,  xxxg2424xxx  (wrs), which is coinduced with
ido by ifn-g, is downregulated by il-4 and il-13. the
effect of il-4 and il-13 was independent of stat-6. modulation of ido but not wrs was eliminated by inhibition of
protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) activity. the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathway further differentiated the
regulation of these two enzymes, as inhibiting the pi3k
pathway eliminated ifn-g induction of ido, whereas such
inhibition greatly enhanced wrs expression. these ﬁndings show discordance between modulations of expression
of two distinct enzymes utilizing tryptophan as a common
substrate, and raise the possibility of their involvement in
regulating immune responses in various neurological disorders. v 2007 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) is the ﬁrst and
rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of quinolinic acid
(quin) from tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway
outside of the liver. ido serves immunoregulatory as
well as tolerogenic functions (frumento et al., 2002;
munn et al., 1999, 2004; terness et al., 2002). activation
of ido leads to defects in various immunoregulatory
mechanisms, including the failure of immune surveillance of tumor cells (friberg et al., 2002; munn et al.,
2004), development of autoimmune conditions such as
multiple sclerosis and autoimmune diabetes (grohmann
et al., 2003; sakurai et al., 2002), and allogenic fetal
rejection (munn et al., 1998). by depleting the essential
amino acid tryptophan and generating tryptophan
catabolites, ido regulates immune responses by inhibic 2007

ting t-cell functions (frumento et al., 2002; meisel
et al., 2004; munn et al., 2004; terness et al., 2002).
in addition to its effects on the immune system, tryptophan catabolism also affects the central nervous system
(cns). in the brain, ido is primarily produced by activated macrophages and microglia. as tryptophan is the
precursor for the neurotransmitter serotonin, its idoinduced depletion can cause untoward psychological/psychiatric consequences leading to depression (widner et al.,
2000). during hiv infection, which also has cns consequences due to the presence of the virus–host interaction in the cns, the ido-mediated increased accumulation of tryptophan catabolites such as quin, has been
proposed to have a pathogenic role in inducing neuronal
death (bara et al., 2000; burudi et al., 2002; grant
et al., 2000; heyes et al., 1989, 1992; stone, 2001). in
addition to ido’s potential role in hiv-associated dementia, in alzheimer’s disease it has been shown that
the inﬂammatory cytokines and the amyloid b protein
ab 1-42 induce ido expression and production of quin
in neurotoxic concentrations by human macrophages
and microglia, leading to neuronal death (guillemin and
brew, 2002; guillemin et al., 2003).
tryptophan catabolism and depletion can be quite
detrimental to the host cells. although there are no alternative mechanisms which can rescue cells from quininduced cell death, tryptophan starvation can be prevented by another enzyme,  xxxg2424xxx 
(wrs), which is coinduced with ido (boasso et al., 2005)
by host cells as a self-protection mechanism. wrs catalyzes the attachment of tryptophan to its cognate transfer
rna molecule, with the resulting trp-trna complex used
for protein synthesis (fleckner et al., 1995; rubin et al.,
1991). thus, it provides a reservoir of tryptophan directly available for protein synthesis and protects the cells
from ido-induced tryptophan depletion by allowing them

to use limiting amounts of tryptophan during protein
synthesis (boasso et al., 2005; murray, 2003). parallel
induction of ido and wrs by ifn-g has been found in a
number of cell types (boasso et al., 2005; fleckner et al.,
1995; rubin et al., 1991; yoshida et al., 1981). on the
other hand, anti-inﬂammatory cytokines can antagonize
many cellular responses induced by ifn-g, including ido
induction (chaves et al., 2001; doherty et al., 1993; musso
et al., 1994; oswald et al., 1992; yuan et al., 1998), but
the effects on wrs are not as well studied.
the understanding of the dynamic interplay between
factors controlling ido and wrs in the cns is critical.
however, the data are scarce as to the mechanism
behind the regulation of ido and wrs in the brain. the
present study addresses this issue by evaluating the
ability of a stimulatory cytokine (ifn-g) and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines [il-4 and il-13, related cytokines that
share a common receptor component (kelly-welch et al.,
2003)] to regulate ido and wrs expression in mouse
primary microglia. the regulation of expression as well
as signaling mechanisms diverged for ido and wrs,
which can affect the host response to disease.
materials and methods
animals
stat-1 knock out (s1ko) mice were developed by dr.
robert schreiber and provided with his permission by
dr. iain campbell. the s1ko mice are on a mixed
c57bl/6 3 129 background, and f2 wild-type mice
between these strains were used for controls to ensure
lack of background effects. the stat-6 knock out
(s6ko) mice were obtained from the jackson laboratory
(bar harbor, me). the s6ko mice are on the balb/c
background, and wild-type balb/c mice were used for
their controls, as well as for all other experiments. mice
were bred and maintained in the scripps research
institute’s animal facility. all experiments were conducted under nih and the institutional animal care
and use committee guidelines for animal care and use.
cell culture and reagents
primary mouse microglia cultures were developed
from the brains of newborn to 2-day-old pups. brains
were carefully freed from meninges, followed by trituration in dmem containing trypsin and edta. following
a 20-min incubation at room temperature, trypsinization
was stopped by dilution with ﬁve times the volume of
dmem containing 10% fbs. the cells were centrifuged,
resuspended in hepes-buffered dmem containing 10%
fbs, penicillin–streptomycin– xxxd164xxx  (complete or
cdmem), and plated in 75-cm2 ﬂask. the following day,
media was replaced with cdmem containing 25 ng/ml
recombinant mouse gm-csf (peprotech, rocky hill,
nj) and incubated for 10 days. cells were then detached
by mild scraping and microglial cells were isolated using
 xxxg1206xxx  mac column separation as per the manufacturer’s protocol (miltenyi biotec, auburn, ca).
glia doi 10.1002/glia

the mouse microglial cell line eoc13.31 (crl-2468)
was purchased from the atcc (manassas, va) and was
cultured, as recommended by the supplier, in cdmem
containing 20% conditioned media from the ladmac
(crl-2420, also obtained from the atcc) cell line.
before cytokine treatments, cells (105 cells/ml) were
incubated in dmem containing 0.1% fbs for 48 h. the
cytokines were purchased from peprotech (rocky hill,
nj) and added simultaneously to the culture. the optimal doses of cytokines and the optimal time period for
maximal ido mrna expression were determined by calibration curves for both dose and time period. a stable
plateau of expression was found between 16 and 30 h,
and a 24-h stimulation period was chosen for assessing
levels of mrna expression. similarly a plateau was
found for ifn-g treatment at concentrations >6.25 ng/
ml, and at concentrations >10 ng/ml for il-4/il-13 cotreatment, thus 10 ng/ml was chosen for ifn-g and
24 ng/ml for il-4/il-13 to assess levels of mrna expression. neutralizing anti-mouse il-4 antisera was
obtained from r&d systems (minneapolis, mn).
 xxxd2523xxx ,  xxxd3536xxx  (calbiochem-novabiochem, la
jolla, ca), and okadaic acid (ag scientiﬁc, san diego,
ca) were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  and used as
described. all experiments were performed in triplicate.

facs and immunoﬂuorescence
for facs, microglial cells were suspended at 106
cells/ml in facs staining buffer (pbs containing 2%
fbs and 0.2% sodium azide), and stained with fitc-labeled anti  xxxg1206xxx  (bd bioscience, san jose, ca) for
20 min in dark at 4°c. suitable isotype controls were
used for calibration. cells were washed and resuspended
in staining buffer and processed through a facscan
ﬂow cytometer before analysis. for immunoﬂuorescence,
105 cells were plated on coverslips in a 24-well plate for
48 h. cells were ﬁxed for 25 min with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°c, washed with pbs, and permeabilized by adding 0.2% tween 20 in pbs. nonspeciﬁc binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 10%
goat serum in pbs containing 0.2% tween 20. to speciﬁcally stain microglia, neurons, and astrocytes in primary
cell cultures, cells were then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with dilutions of anti-iba-1 (wako, osaka,
japan) at 1:1,000, anti-microtubule associated protein-2
( xxxg1360xxx ; sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) at 1:500 or antiglial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (gfap; sigma-aldrich) at
1:500, respectively. after three washes, the cells were
treated with secondary polyclonal antibodies, alexafluor
488-conjugated goat anti rabbit (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) at 1:500 or rhodamine red-x conjugated goat antimouse igg (invitrogen) at 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. for ido protein expression, eoc13.31 cells were
incubated overnight with anti-ido antibody (alexis biochemicals, san diego, ca) (1:500) at 4°c, washed, and
incubated with secondary rhodamine red-x conjugated
goat anti-mouse igg (invitrogen) at 1:500 dilution. the
cells were then counterstained with ﬂuorescent nuclear

differential regulation of ido and wrs by il-4

stain 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi; sigmaaldrich). the coverslips containing cells were air-dried,
and mounted on glass microscope slides in vectashield
mounting media (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca).
images from coverslips were visualized and acquired
using a zeiss axiovert 200 inverted microscope at 53
magniﬁcation.

rna isolation and reverse transcription
total rna was extracted from the cell pellets. two microgram of rna was used for reverse transcription. for a 20
ll reaction, reverse transcription was carried out using the
superscript kit (invitrogen) for 1 h at 42°c, followed by 70°c
for 5 min to inactivate the rt reagents. rnase h (new england biolabs, beverly, ma) treatment was given at 37°c for
20 min. the rt product was then diluted with an equal volume of rnase and dnase free water.

measurement of ido activity
to monitor ido enzyme activity, cell supernatants
were assayed spectrophotometrically for the presence
of kynurenine (braun et al., 2005), the ﬁrst stable
catabolite downstream of ido. brieﬂy, eoc13.31 cells
were incubated without cytokines, or with 100 ng/ml
of ifn-g in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml of
il-4 for 96 h at 37°c. about 160 ll of the supernatants were incubated with 10 ll 30% tca at 50°c for
30 min, vortexed, and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for
5 min. then 100 ll of the supernatants were added to
an equal volume of ehrlich’s reagent (4% p-dimethyl
benzaldehyde in glacial acetic acid) in a 96-well microtiter plate. after 10 min, the optical density was measured at 492 nm using a victor3 plate reader (perkinelmer, waltham, ma). the concentration of kynurenine
in the unknowns was calculated by plotting a standard curve of deﬁned kynurenine concentrations
(0–1,000 lm).

western blot analysis
following cytokine treatments, the cells were washed
three times in ice-cold pbs, scraped, and lysed in icecold ripa lysis buffer [50 mm hepes buffer, sodium
orthovandate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm
naf, 1% triton x-100, 30 mm  xxxd2822xxx ,
1 mm pmsf, 13 complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(roche diagnostics, indianapolis, usa)]. after incubation for 30 min on ice, samples were centrifuged at
high speed for 15 min and supernatants collected. total
protein content was estimated using the biorad protein assay. an aliquot corresponding to 25 lg of total
protein of each sample was separated by sds-page
and transferred electrophoretically to hy-bondtm
pvdf membranes (invitrogen). nonspeciﬁc antibody
binding was blocked by either 5% bsa or nonfat dried
milk for 1 h at room temperature. immunoblotting was
carried out with antibodies against total stat-1 (bd
bioscience), pstat-1 tyr701 (bd bioscience), and
pstat-1 ser727 (biosource international, camarillo,
ca), and anti-actin (sigma) as a loading control, followed by secondary antibody (1:10,000 hrp conjugated
anti rabbit or anti mouse igg; invitrogen). blots were
developed with 1:1 solution of super signal west pico
chemiluminescent substrate and luminol/enhancer
(pierce, rockford, il).

quantitative real time pcr
speciﬁc rna transcripts (mrna) were quantiﬁed by
real time pcr using dual-labeled hydrolysis probes
(fam-tamra). the primers and probe sequences were
designed for mouse sequences using the genescript
online
tool
(https://www.genescript.com/ssi-bin/app/
primer) and obtained from eurogentec (san diego, ca).
the following primers and probes were used: ido-f (ga
gaaagccaaggaaatttttaagag, 0.6 lm), -r (gata
tatgcggagaacgtggaaa, 0.6 lm), probe (tgcgtg
actttgtggacccagacac, 0.4 lm); wrs-f (tccgagacaggacagatatcca, 0.6 lm), -r (cacgtcccttg
tcattctgaag, 0.6 lm), probe (cctcatcccgtgtgc
cattgagcc, 0.6 lm), and for 18s-f (cggctaccaca
tccaaggaa, 0.6 lm), -r (gctggaattaccgcgg
ct, 0.6 lm), probe (tgctggcaccagacttgccctc,
0.2 lm). to carry out quantitative real time pcr, 2 ll of
the (1:10) diluted cdna was used for assaying the
amount of 18s endogenous ribosomal rna, and 5 ll was
used for quantiﬁcation of ido as well as wrs mrna in
duplicates. the reaction utilized 12.5 ll of platinum
qpcr  xxxg2389xxx  supermix (invitrogen), yielding 0.75 u taq
dna polymerase, 20 mm tris-hcl, 50 mm kcl, 3 mm
mgcl2, and 200 lm of deoxynucleoside triphosphate. the
reaction mixture was brought to a ﬁnal concentration of
5 mm mgcl2. real time reaction was performed in 96well plate on a stratagene mx3000p real time machine
(stratagene, la jolla, ca). each assay was optimized by
titrating a range of primer and probe concentrations and
determining their cycle threshold (ct) values. the primer
and probe combinations that gave the lowest ct and best
ampliﬁcation plots were used for the ﬁnal analysis. the
reaction was run at an initial temperature of 95°c for
10 min and then at 95°c for 30 s, 55°c for 1 min, followed by 72°c for 30 s for 45 cycles. the optical signal
was recorded at the end of every 72°c extension step. ct
values were determined by the software according to the
optimization of the baseline. for computing the relative
amounts of ido and wrs in the samples, the average ct
of the primary signal for 18s was subtracted from that of
ido and wrs to give changes in cts (dct, a log2 scale).
a baseline dct of 25 was subtracted and the results multiplied by 21. in this manner, the degree of change in
gene expression was determined. relative units (2dct)
were calculated and used here as a measure of ido and
wrs mrna expression. the normalization of ido and
wrs with 18s controls for variation in the efﬁciency of

the functional activity of ido to convert tryptophan into
kynurenine. when il-4 was added to the culture along
with ifn-g, an average of 3.2-fold (p < 0.001) increase
in kynurenine concentration was observed when compared with that of the cells treated with ifn-g alone.
this shows that il-4 is an enhancer of ifn-g-induced
expression of ido at mrna, protein, as well as at the
functional activity level.

statistical analysis
signiﬁcance testing was done for treatments with at
least ﬁve biological replicates. otherwise descriptive statistics were generated. we tested this result across treatments (ifn-g vs. ifn-g plus il-4/il-13) using one tailed
paired t tests, and compared each treatment by marker
(ido vs. wrs) using one tailed unpaired t tests assuming
equal variance where the difference between means was
interpreted as signiﬁcant when p < 0.05. equality of variance was tested using an f test. all parametric tests
were done on the log10 transformed values.
results
il-4 increases ifn-c-induced ido
expression in microglia
using the eoc13.31 mouse microglia cell line, we ﬁrst
explored ifn-g induction of ido expression in microglia.
as expected from other studies on myeloid cells, ifn-g
induced the expression of ido mrna (fig. 1a). in the
presence of ifn-g, tgf-b decreased and  xxxg2296xxx 
increased ido expression (data not shown), consistent
with others’ results (kwidzinski et al., 2005; mackenzie
et al., 1999; robinson et al., 2003; yuan et al., 1998).
however, il-4, which has been reported to inhibit ido
expression in a number of cell types, increased ifn-ginduced ido expression (fig. 1b). this effect could be
completely abrogated by the addition of an antiserum
against il-4 (fig. 1c).
the effect of il-4 in potentiation of ifn-g-induced
ido expression was also observed at protein levels by
immunoﬂuorescence studies. compared with cells stimulated with ifn-g alone, a 1.9-fold increase was observed
in the number of cells with detectable ido protein
expression when il-4 was added in the culture along
with ifn-g (fig. 2). furthermore, il-4 also enhanced
glia doi 10.1002/glia

primary microglia
to further assess the mechanisms by which ido is regulated in microglia, we performed studies on primary mouse
microglia. our method of isolation of microglia from neonatal mouse brains, culture, and subsequent immunomagnetic puriﬁcation led to higher purity (as indicated by
facs staining) than other methods of isolation that were
tried (sedgwick et al., 1991). the purity of microglial cells
using this method was estimated to be 95% based on
detection with facs staining using anti  xxxg1206xxx  antibody
(fig. 3a). immunostaining of cultures (fig. 3b) using antibodies against microglia (anti-iba-1), astrocytes (antigfap), and neurons (anti- xxxg1360xxx , not shown) revealed
that contaminating cells were primarily astrocytes.
il-4 and il-13 enhance ifn-c-induced ido
expression, but reduce wrs expression
since il-13 shares many properties with il-4, we examined the effects of both il-4 and il-13 in regulating  xxxg1141xxx -induced ido expression in primary microglia. additionally, since wrs has been reported to be coinduced with
ido by ifn-g, its expression was studied in parallel. cultures of primary microglia were treated with ifn-g, il-4
or il-13, and ifn-g with or without il-4 or il-13. total
rna was isolated and analyzed for expression of ido and
wrs by quantitative real time pcr. neither il-4 nor il13 alone could induce ido or wrs, as mrna levels were
similar to those in untreated cells. treatment with ifn-g
alone greatly enhanced the expression of both ido and

wrs when compared with untreated cells. treatment of
ifn-g stimulated cells with il-4 or il-13 indeed consistently enhanced the expression of ifn-g-induced ido by
an average of twofold (n 5 6, p 5 0.0068) with il-4 and
3.2-fold with il-13 (n 5 7, p 5 0.0148) (figs. 4a,b). in
contrast, an average of threefold decrease was observed in
wrs expression when cells were treated with ifn-g plus
il-4 (n 5 6, p 5 0.0017) and 2.7-fold with ifn-g plus il13 (n 5 7, p 5 0.0004) when compared with treatment
with ifn-g alone (figs. 4c,d). this result reveals a differential modulation of ifn-g-induced expression of ido and
wrs genes by il-4/il-13 in microglia.
ifn-c utilizes stat-1, but il-4 and il-13 act
independently of  xxxg2217xxx , in modulating ido and

ifn-g can exert its effects on cells by binding to its receptor and activating the jak/stat-1 pathway for transcription of ifn-g responsive genes (bach et al., 1997).
we sought to determine whether ifn-g-mediated induction of ido and wrs and their modulation by il-4 or

il-13 is stat-1 dependent. microglia from stat-1
knock out (s1ko) mice were stimulated with ifn-g with
or without il-4 or il-13. in the absence of stat-1,
treatment with either ifn-g alone or in combination
with il-4 or il-13 could not alter the expression of ido
and wrs (figs. 5a,b). this indicates that in microglia
stat-1 is critical for ifn-g modulation of ido and wrs
expression.
stat-6 plays a central role in cellular functions mediated by il-4 and il-13. to assess whether stat-6 is
involved in il-4/il-13-mediated modulation of ido and
wrs expression, we evaluated ido and wrs expression
in the presence of il-4 or il-13 in primary microglia isolated from stat-6 knock out (s6ko) mice. the results
observed in s6ko mice were similar to that observed in

fig. 4. il-4 and il-13 enhance ifn-g-induced ido expression but
reduce wrs expression in mouse microglia. microglias were stimulated
with cytokines for 24 h and total rna was analyzed for ido (a, b) and
wrs (c, d) expression by real time rt-pcr. data are representative of

six independent experiments with il-4 and seven independent experiments with il-13 done in triplicate. ido expression in ifn-g stimulated
cells was signiﬁcantly increased by treatment with il-4 or il-13, whereas
ifn-g-stimulated wrs expression signiﬁcantly reduced by il-4 or il-13.

wild-type (wt) mice. in the absence of stat-6, il-4 still
consistently enhanced ifn-g-induced ido expression by
an average of 2.7-fold (n 5 6, p 5 0.0004) (fig. 5c) and
reduced wrs expression by 3.1-fold (n 5 6, p 5 0.0073)
(fig. 5d). similarly, il-13 enhanced ifn-g-induced ido
expression by an average of 3.7-fold (n 5 5, p 5 0.0184)
and reduced wrs expression by 3.7-fold (n 5 5, p 5
0.0239). thus, the il-4 and il-13 effects on ido and
wrs expression observed here are independent of  xxxg2217xxx  activation.

we therefore examined whether il-4 or il-13 converge
with ifn-g at the point of enhancing stat-1 phosphorylation, thus augmenting ido expression. the degree
of phosphorylation of both tyr 701 and ser 727 on
stat-1 was assessed by western blotting in the presence of ifn-g with or without il-4 or il-13 using stat1 phosphorylation-site speciﬁc antibodies in microglia
protein extracts from wt (fig. 6a) as well as s6ko
mice (fig. 6b). no difference in either tyr 701 or ser
727 phosphorylation of stat-1 was observed when cells
were treated with ifn-g with il-4 or il-13 when compared with ifn-g alone. therefore, il-4 and il-13 aid
ifn-g in upregulating ido expression by utilizing a
mechanism other than enhancing stat-1 phosphorylation.

il-4 and il-13 do not act by enhancing
stat-1 phosphorylation
binding of ifn-g to its receptor activates  xxxg1219xxx  and
 xxxg1220xxx  tyrosine kinases, which then phosphorylate tyrosine 701 on stat-1. consequently, stat-1 homodimers
are formed and bind to ifn-g-inducible promoters (darnell et al., 1994). additionally, stat-1 phosphorylation
on serine 727 also occurs and leads to a strong enhancement of the stat-1-induced transcription of ifn-g responsive genes (nguyen et al., 2001; wen et al., 1995).

differential regulation of ido and wrs by il-4

fig. 5. ifn-g utilizes stat-1 and il-4 act independent of stat-6 in
modulating ido and wrs expression. microglia from s1ko (a, b) and
s6ko (c, d) mice were stimulated with cytokines for 24 h and total
rna was analyzed for ido and wrs expression by real time rt-pcr.

results are representative of three independent experiments for s1ko
and six independent experiments for s6ko done in triplicate. in s6ko
mice, il-4 still signiﬁcantly increased ido and decreases wrs in  xxxg1141xxx -stimulated cells.

(nguyen et al., 2001). interestingly, il-4 and il-13 can
also activate the  xxxg1194xxx  substrate family of proteins, leading to activation of the pi3k (kelly-welch
et al., 2003). to assess the role of pi3k in effects of
il-4/il-13 on ifn-g-induced ido and wrs expression,
microglia were treated with the pi3k inhibitor
 xxxd2523xxx  (ly) prior to cytokine treatments. ifn-ginduced ido expression was decreased by ly an average
of 5.6-fold, and the low level of expression detected in
the presence of ly in ifn-g-stimulated cells was not
altered by the presence or absence of il-4, il-13, or
stat-6 (fig. 7a). in contrast, wrs expression was
enhanced by an average of 4.7-fold, and again this
enhancement was not signiﬁcantly altered in the presence or absence of il-4, il-13, or stat-6. to conﬁrm the
role of pi3k in these divergent effects, we further used
 xxxd3536xxx , another inhibitor of pi3k.  xxxd3536xxx 
indeed consistently reduced the expression of ifn-g-dependent ido an average of 2.3-fold, and enhanced wrs
expression an average of 2.5-fold (fig. 7b), and similar
to the results with ly, no additional effects were found

with il-4 or il-13, or in stat-6 knockouts. we note
that the magnitude of the effects of  xxxd3536xxx  on ido
and wrs were of lower levels than those found with ly,
and believe these are likely due to the relative instability of  xxxd3536xxx  in tissue culture conditions (vanhaesebroeck and waterﬁeld, 1999).
as with the stat-1 results earlier, we found that
pi3k is essential for induction of ido expression by
ifn-g. however these observations suggest that the
pi3k inhibition might activate an alternate pathway, or
likely release pi3k-mediated inhibition of different signaling pathway to modulate wrs expression.

il-4 acts through a protein phosphatase
pathway in potentiating ifn-c-induced
ido expression
although we found that both il-4 and il-13 act independent of stat-6, il-4 has also been found to alternatively act through other mechanisms such as map

kinase (mapk), nuclear factor kappa b (nfjb), and
protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a). inhibiting the p38
mapk and nfjb with pharmacological inhibitors
( xxxd3177xxx  and pdtc, respectively) did not lead to a
change in ido expression in the presence of ifn-g plus
il-4 (data not shown). however, in the presence of
pp2a inhibitor okadaic acid (oa), ifn-g plus il-4
induced ido expression was signiﬁcantly reduced by an
average of 3.5-fold (n 5 3, p 5 0.0010), whereas pp2a
inhibition did not signiﬁcantly affect ido expression in
the presence of ifn-g alone (fig. 8a). although oa can
also inhibit protein phosphatase 1 (pp1), at the concentration utilized here it is selective for pp2a (bialojan
and takai, 1988; ludowyke et al., 2000). thus, these
data are consistent with il-4 acting through pp2a in
potentiating ifn-g-induced ido expression. however,
no signiﬁcant change was observed in wrs expression
when microglia were treated with oa in the presence of
ifn-g alone or in conjunction with il-4 (fig. 8b), indicating that the pp2a pathway does not play a role in
the il-4 downregulation of wrs.

discussion
ido and wrs are the two enzymes that are involved
in tryptophan catabolism and its use in protein synthesis, respectively. both ido and wrs are ifn-g inducible
in a wide variety of cell types (fleckner et al., 1995;
rubin et al., 1991). thus, ifn-g exerts a dual effect on
tryptophan metabolism by increasing the rate of tryptophan degradation and by enhancing the ability of the
cell to use low amounts of tryptophan. the results from
the present study in mouse microglia are consistent
glia doi 10.1002/glia

with previous reports showing that the expression of
ido and wrs is upregulated by ifn-g. however, many
have reported that il-4 and il-13 antagonize the effects
of ifn-g (chaves et al., 2001; doherty et al., 1993;
musso et al., 1994; o’keefe et al., 1999; oswald et al.,
1992; yuan et al., 1998). in distinct contrast, here we
show for the ﬁrst time that in microglia, il-4 and il-13
modulate the expression of these enzymes in a distinct
fashion (summarized in figs. 9a,b). in the presence of
ifn-g, both il-4 and il-13 upregulated the expression
of ido but downregulated wrs expression. both cytokines acted in a stat-6 independent manner, and were
also independent of p38 mapk and nfjb. inhibition of
pp2a abrogated il-4-mediated potentiation of ido but
not the suppression of wrs, revealing one of the mechanisms of the observed effects. moreover, in this study,
we also demonstrated divergent effects of pi3k inhibition on the ifn-g-induced expression of ido and wrs,
as pi3k inhibition reduced ido but enhanced wrs
expression.
the antagonistic effects of various cytokines to ifn-g
on ido expression in ﬁbroblasts as well as the myeloid
lineage dendritic cells and monocytes have been
reported (chaves et al., 2001; doherty et al., 1993;
musso et al., 1994; yuan et al., 1998). however, the
effects of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines such as il-4 and
il-13 on the expression of ifn-g-induced ido and wrs
expression in primary microglia, the resident myeloid
cells of the cns that are involved in various pathological disorders of the brain, have not been previously evaluated. in contrast to previous reports in other cell types,
microglial cells responded uniquely, as both il-4 and il13 enhanced ifn-g-induced expression of ido.
in several brain disorders, such as hiv/siv encephalitis, there is an increase of ido in the brain, which is
linked to increased levels of ifn-g, likely expressed in
inﬁltrating t lymphocytes (burudi et al., 2002). il-4 and
il-13 expression has been found to be present in the
normal brain (szczepanik et al., 2001), and il-4 has
been found to have a role in the cns and other pathologies induced by shiv infection in macaques (buch et al.,
2004; dhillon et al., 2005). the cellular sources of il-4
and il-13 in the brain, however, are uncertain. in multiple sclerosis, il-4 expression is most prominent in astrocytes (hulshof et al., 2002), and in rodents, intracerebral
lps injection induces microglial il-13 expression (shin
et al., 2004). the sources of il-4 and il-13 in the brain
may also be type i helper and cytotoxic t cells (mosmann and sad, 1996). in the present study, il-4
enhanced the expression of ifn-g-induced ido both at
mrna and protein levels and also enhanced the functional activity of ido. although the level of expression
of ifn-g is the limiting factor in the context of ido
expression, it is tempting to speculate that the presence
of il-4 and/or il-13 could be potentiating factors that
prolong and exacerbate the effect of ifn-g on ido
induction leading to neurotoxicity and immunosuppression.
il-4 and il-13 both downregulated ifn-g-induced
wrs expression. as wrs is coinduced with ido, it has

been suggested that ido-expressing cells avoid the negative effects of ido-induced tryptophan depletion and
protect themselves from tryptophan self-starvation by
increasing the expression of wrs as a compensatory
mechanism (boasso et al., 2005; murray, 2003). our
results in microglia indeed showed upregulation of ido
and wrs by ifn-g. however, in the presence of il-4
and il-13, wrs expression decreased, while ido
increased. in pathologies where il-4 or il-13 would be
present, ifn-g-induced ido would be upregulated but
wrs would be downregulated. expression of ifn-g and
il-4 are found simultaneously in the brain in human
neurocysticercosis and mouse cryptocococcal meningoencephalitis (maffei et al., 2004; restrepo et al., 2001).
ido-expressing cells are indeed present in granulomatous inﬂammation (popov et al., 2006). since granuloma
formation allows for control of the pathogen, ido-medi-

ated t-cell inhibition can actually protect the host from
the untoward consequences of harmful immune reactivity (zganiacz et al., 2004). the discordance between the
il-4 and il-13 mediated enhancement of ido, but suppression of wrs may represent a mechanism by which
the immune system can still inhibit an infected cell.
although the enhanced ido expression leads to immune
inhibition, suppression of wrs leads to the cell’s inability to utilize the diminishing amounts of tryptophan,
thereby inhibiting needed protein synthesis.
to understand the mechanisms of these divergent
effects, we ﬁrst examined stat-1, central to mediating
the effects of ifn-g. in the absence of stat-1 there was
no induction of either gene indicating the involvement of
stat-1 in modulating ido and wrs expression. since
stat-1 was essential, we further investigated whether
il-4 or il-13 enhances stat-1 phosphorylation to

fig. 9. mechanistic overview of differential modulation of ido (a)
and wrs (b) by il-4 along with ifn-g in mouse microglia. binding of
ifn-g to its receptor leads to activation of stat-1, and this in turn
leads to transcription of ido and wrs genes. il-4 potentiates ido
expression but downregulates wrs expression in the presence of ifn-g
in a stat-6 independent manner. pp2a does not play a role in wrs
expression by ifn-g and/or il-4, however, inhibition of pp2a abrogates
il-4 upregulation of ifn-g-induced ido expression. ifn-g also utilizes
pi3k pathway in inducing ido expression as shown by ly and wm
(pi3k inhibitors). however, use of ly and wm enhances wrs expression unlike suppression of ido expression again showing differential
regulation of ido and wrs, two enzymes utilizing tryptophan as a
common substrate.

potentiate ido expression. however, both il-4 and il13 were not active in altering ifn-g-induced patterns of
stat-1 phosphorylation. second, we examined the role
of stat-6, the main signaling pathway triggered by il-4
and il-13. the data reported here reveal that the effects
of il-4 and il-13 on ifn-g-induced ido and wrs
expression were stat-6 independent.
the inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  and il-12 by il-4 in macrophages has been shown to be in part stat-6 independent, but the pathway has not been identiﬁed (levings
and schrader, 1999). another report showed that il-4
utilizes pp2a but not stat-6 in inhibition of tnf-ainduced formyl peptide receptor 2 expression (iribarren
et al., 2005). here we found that inhibition of pp2a signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of ido in the presence
of ifn-g plus il-4, but did not affect ido expression in
the presence of ifn-g alone. although the inhibitor
used, oa, is known to show selectivity for pp2a over its
other potential target, pp1, further studies are needed
to deﬁne the exact role of kinases and phosphatases in
the regulation of ido. a large body of evidence suggests
that pp2a acts at multiple points in the signal transduction cascade (gomez and spitzer, 1999). therefore, it is
possible that pp2a might be deactivating an inhibitory
factor in the pathway where il-4 converges with ifn-g
in potentiation of ido expression. on the other hand,
pp2a inhibition did not alter the expression of wrs
under the same conditions, indicating that the modulation of wrs expression by il-4 is independent of pp2a.
thus, this underlines the fact that il-4 differentially
regulates the expression of ido and wrs.
pi3k is an important factor in cell proliferation and
plays a crucial role in mediating survival signals in a
wide range of cells (ahmed et al., 1997; dudek et al.,
1997). ifn-g can also lead to activation of pi3k (hwang
glia doi 10.1002/glia

et al., 2004). inhibition of pi3k indeed prevented the
ifn-g-induced upregulation of ido, however, it accentuated the ifn-g-induced expression of wrs. few reports
show that inhibition of pi3k leads to enhanced gene
transcription. for example, pi3k inhibition led to
enhanced expression of urokinase-like plasminogen activator (mochizuki et al., 2002) and an increase in  xxxg1578xxx  production (pahan et al., 1999).
in our study, one possibility of enhanced wrs expression in the presence of pi3k inhibitors may be that the
inhibitors may be activating some other, yet undescribed, pathway for wrs induction, or they could more
likely be releasing a pi3k-mediated inhibition of
another signaling pathway to modulate wrs expression.
studies are underway to decipher the mechanism underlying these phenomena.
in conclusion, our data reveal the interplay between a
pro-inﬂammatory cytokine ifn-g, and the anti-inﬂammatory cytokines il-4 and il-13, as well as a role of
pi3k, in the differential regulation of ido and wrs
expression in microglia. the physiological beneﬁt of
inverse correlation between ido and wrs in a pathological condition might favor tryptophan catabolism in
infected cells, preventing their escape from immune
attack due to ido expression. thus, these pathways
may represent important therapeutic targets for treatment of neuroinﬂammatory diseases.
