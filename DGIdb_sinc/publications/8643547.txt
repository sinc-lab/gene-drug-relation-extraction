nant vaccinia virus (2). permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin provided the first demonstration that
monoamine substrates could be directly accumulated by an
intracellular compartment of nonneuroendocrine cells expressing this transporter in an atp-dependent fashion that
was sensitive to the specific inhibitors reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx ). the mrna for this transporter (now called
vmat2) was shown to be abundantly expressed in monoaminergic cell bodies of the central nervous system and also in the
stomach but not in the adrenal gland. independently, edwards
and colleagues (3) cloned a highly related  xxxg2099xxx  (formerly
named  xxxg2098xxx ) from a rat pheochromocytoma (pc12) cell line
based on its ability to confer resistance to n-methyl-4phenylpyridinium (mpp+) toxicity in transfected chinese hamster ovary cells by intracellular sequestration of the toxin.  xxxg2098xxx 
(now called  xxxg2098xxx ) was shown to be abundantly expressed in
the adrenal medulla but absent from the brain, and it displayed
low sensitivity to inhibition by  xxxd3330xxx . subsequently, the pharmacology and the tissue distribution of the two isoforms of the rat
vmats have been characterized in detail (4-8).
somewhat surpisingly, the neuronal vmat2 isoform has
been found to be abundantly expressed in the bovine adrenal
medulla (9-11). this observation suggested that important
species differences may exist in the expression of the  xxxg2099xxx 
isoforms in endocrine organs and neural tissues. because there
are in fact two human  xxxg2099xxx  isoforms (hvmat1 and hvmat2), we compared the distributions of the two isoforms in
the human neuroendocrine system and hvmat1 and hvmat2 transport properties in vitro to determine how differences in the properties of each transporter might explain the
differential uptake, action, and toxicity of neuropharmacological and neurotoxic agents in human.

a second isoform of the human vesicular
abstract
 xxxg2099xxx  (hvmat) has been cloned from a
pheochromocytoma cdna library. the contribution of the two
transporter isoforms to monoamine storage in human neuroendocrine tissues was examined with isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against hvmat1 and hvmat2. central,
peripheral, and enteric neurons express only vmat2.  xxxg2098xxx 
is expressed exclusively in neuroendocrine, including chromaffin and enterochromaffin, cells.  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 are
coexpressed in all chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.
vmat2 alone is expressed in histamine-storing enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. the
transport characteristics and pharmacology of each  xxxg2099xxx 
isoform have been directly compared after expression in
digitonin-permeabilized fibroblastic (cv-1) cells, providing
information about substrate feature recognition by each
transporter and the role of vesicular monoamine storage in
the mechanism of action of psychopharmacologic and neurotoxic agents in human. serotonin has a similar affinity for
both transporters. catecholamines exhibit a 3-fold higher
affinity, and histamine exhibits a 30-fold higher affinity, for
vmat2. reserpine and  xxxd2419xxx  are slightly more potent
inhibitors of vmat2-mediated transport than of vmat1mediated transport, whereas  xxxd3330xxx  binds to and inhibits only vmat2. n-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, phenylethylamine, amphetamine, and  xxxd2611xxx  are all more potent inhibitors of vmat2 than of
 xxxg2098xxx , whereas fenfluramine is a more potent inhibitor of
 xxxg2098xxx -mediated monamine transport than of vmat2mediated monoamine transport. the unique distributions of
hvmat1 and hvmat2 provide new markers for multiple
neuroendocrine lineages, and examination of their transport
properties provides mechanistic insights into the pharmacology and physiology of amine storage in cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous system function.

materials and methods
preparation of cdna library and cloning of hvmat1. an

oligo(dt)-primed, size-selected cdna library from a human

storage of monoamines in secretory organelles of neurons,
endocrine/paracrine cells, basophils, blood platelets, and mast
cells is critical for their regulated, physiological secretion.

pheochromocytoma was constructed in a modified t7 promoter
bearing plasmid expression vector, cdm7/amp (12). initially,
subdivisions were screened using a pcr-amplified and randomprimed 32p-labeled hvmat2 coding sequence probe at low
stringency as described (13), because it was expected that human
pheochromocytoma, like rat pc12 cells, would express only a

monoamine accumulation from the cytoplasm into storage
organelles is mediated by vesicular monoamine transporters
(vmats) with an absolute dependence on a vacuolar atpase-generated proton gradient to transport the cationic
amine substrates into the storage organelle in exchange for
protons (1).
recently, we cloned a  xxxg2099xxx  (formerly named mat) from
a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (rbl- xxxd2360xxx ) by functional
expression of t7 promoter-driven cdna sublibraries in cv-1
fibroblasts infected with t7 polymerase-expressing recombi-

 xxxg2098xxx  isoform. unexpectedly, a hvmat2 clone was obtained

from this library. the library was rescreened at low stringency
with a rat  xxxg2098xxx  probe that was cloned from a pc12 cdna
library (5), and a hvmat1 clone was obtained. dna sequencing
was performed on each strand of the dna, after subcloning of
overlapping fragments into puc18 as described (13).
characterization of the transport properties of hvmat1
and hvmat2. functional expression of hvmat1 and hvmat2 cdnas was performed using the vaccinia virus/
bacteriophage t7 hybrid system (14). the transport of [3h]serotonin (5ht) was performed in digitonin-permeabilized
cv-1 cells expressing the cdnas as described (4). the binding
of [3h]dihydrotetrabenazine (tbzoh) was performed by
addition of the radioligand to permeabilized fibroblasts exactly
as described for [3h]5ht. cells were washed twice with 1.25
ml of ice-cold intracellular medium, solubilized in 1 % sds,
and counted by scintillation counting.
generation of hvmat antibodies. peptides were synthesized from the predicted c-terminal sequences of hvmat1
and hvmat2 (rmyatqkptkefplgedsdeepdhee
and tqnniqsypigedeesesd, respectively) with an additional n-terminal cysteine residue through which coupling to
maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (pierce) was
accomplished after peptide purification by hplc (peninsula
laboratories). antibodies were generated by immunization of
new zealand white rabbits as described (5).
immunohistochemistry. human tissues were immersion-fixed
in bouin-hollande fixative, washed free of excess fixative in
alcohol, and embedded in paraffin for preparation of 7-,um
sections for staining. primary antibodies were used at 1:300010,000 dilution, and binding to antigen was visualized by application of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit anti-igg antibody, followed
by streptavidin-coupled peroxidase and incubation with peroxide
and diaminobenzidine as described (15). the primary rabbit
antisera used were: anti-hvmat1 #10 (1:2000-4000), antihvmat2 #80182 (1:2000-4000), anti-serotonin 43h37r

results
sequence analysis of the hvmatl cdna. the 2.7-kb
 xxxg2098xxx  cdna clone revealed an open reading frame of 1545
bp, predicting a protein of 526 amino acids. the amino acid
sequence of hvmat1 is shown in fig. 1. hvmat1 and
hvmat2 display an overall homology of 60%, with greatest
identity within the putative 12 transmembrane regions of these
proteins. three potential glycosylation sites are observed for
hvmat1 in contrast to four sites in vmat2 in a poorly
conserved reglon predicted to reside within the lumen of the
storage organelle. the cytoplasmic n and c termini are also
poorly conserved between  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 isoforms.
functional expression of hvmat1 and hvmat2 in digitonin-permeabilized cv-1 cells. hvmat1 and hvmat2
transported [3h]5ht with similar kinetics (fig. 24). in the
presence of atp, [3h]5ht uptake mediated by either isoform
reached similar maximal levels ('50 times greater than nonspecific uptake into mock-transfected cv-1 cells) by 10 min at
37°c. uptake was energy dependent (>80% atp dependent)
and was abolished by the proton-translocating ionophore
carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or by
the vacuolar h+-atpase inhibitor tri(n-butyl)tin. the transport process was saturable, with apparent affinity (km) for 5ht
of 1.3 ,m and 0.8 ,um and vm,,x values of 37 and 43 pmol/min
per 450,000 cells for  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2, respectively (fig.
2a, inset).
inhibition of transport by  xxxd3330xxx  is a key feature distinguishing
 xxxg2098xxx  from vmat2.  xxxd3330xxx  inhibited the uptake of [3h]5ht
by vmat2 with a k1 of '100 nm, whereas concentrations of
 xxxd3330xxx  as high as 20 ,um did not affect transport mediated by
 xxxg2098xxx  (fig. 2b). furthermore, only vmat2 showed significant binding of [3h]tbzoh (fig. 2b, inset). binding of

for 5ht (<2-fold difference), catecholamine substrates
showed -3-fold higher affinity for vmat2 than for  xxxg2098xxx ,
and histamine exhibited a 30-fold higher apparent affinity for
vmat2 than for  xxxg2098xxx .
the effect of various compounds to inhibit [3h]5ht uptake by
the  xxxg2099xxx  isoforms is shown in table 2. reserpine and  xxxd2419xxx  were potent inhibitors with the apparent affinity of both
compounds for vmat2 -3-fold higher than for  xxxg2098xxx .
the effect of various neuroactive and neurotoxic compounds to inhibit [3h]5ht uptake by hvmat1 and hvmat2
indicates that the absence of electron-donating substituents on
the aromatic ring of these compounds greatly increases their
differential effects (table 2). the false neurotransmitter phenylethylamine (pea) showed nearly a 10-fold higher affinity
for vmat2 than for  xxxg2098xxx . similarly, amphetamine displayed -20-fold higher affinity for vmat2 than for  xxxg2098xxx .
the effect of amphetamine was stereospecific, with the (+)
isoform about five times more potent than the (-) isoform to
inhibit uptake mediated by either  xxxg2098xxx  or vmat2. the
large differential effect of pea and both amphetamine stereoisomers was due largely to the reduced potency to inhibit
[3h]5ht uptake mediated by  xxxg2098xxx , compared with the
other compounds tested. the presence of the methylenedioxy
moiety on the aromatic ring in a racemic (+) mixture of
 xxxd2611xxx  (mdma) reduced the differential apparent affinity for  xxxg2098xxx  vs. vmat2 to that
observed with the catecholamines, with an overall 2-fold lower
apparent affinity for the transporters. the presence of a
trifluoromethyl group on the aromatic ring of (+) fenfluramine caused an opposite effect, in that  xxxg2098xxx  was about two
times more sensitive to inhibition than vmat2, with an
overall apparent affinity of fenfluramine for  xxxg2098xxx  greater
than that of the catecholamines. like pea, the neurotoxic
mpp+ showed -8-fold higher apparent affinity for vmat2
than for  xxxg2098xxx . the biogenic amine substrates were, however, considerably more potent for inhibition of [3h]5ht
uptake by either isoform than was mpp+.
specificity of hvmat1 and hvmat2 c-terminal peptide
antisera. the c-terminal anti-peptide antibodies against
 xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 were used to differentially stain vmat1and vmat2-expressing cv-1 cells in the presence and absence
of the peptides used to generate each antiserum, to ensure their
complete specificity before use in mapping the differential expression of each transporter isoform in the human nervous and
endocrine systems (fig. 3). based upon the characteristics of
[3h]5ht uptake by either  xxxg2099xxx  transporter isoform, equivalent
amounts of each protein can be expressed in cv-1 cells. only
 xxxg2098xxx -expressing cv-1 cells can be stained with antiserum
against  xxxg2098xxx . likewise, only vmat2-expressing cv-1 cells
can be stained with antiserum against vmat2. when antisera
are preincubated with 25 ,um peptides from which the antisera
were produced, specific staining was abolished (fig. 3).

hvmat1 staining in sympathetic ganglia was confined to
the small intensely fluorescent cells of peripheral sympathetic
ganglia (fig. 4c), whereas hvmat2 staining was observed in
the principal ganglion cells of the sympathetic nervous system
(fig. 4d). in the enteric nervous system, vmat2-positive,
5ht-containing cell bodies were detected in the myenteric
plexus (data not shown).
 xxxg2098xxx - and vmat2-specific antisera each stained virtually all chromaffin cells of the human adrenal medulla, indicating complete coexpression of both isoforms in the gland
(fig. 4 e and f). consistent with this observation, polyadenylated mrna extracted from human pheochromocytoma
demonstrated abundant expression of both  xxxg2098xxx  (3.0 kb)
and vmat2 (4.2 kb) transcripts upon northern blot hybridization (data not shown).
 xxxg2098xxx -positive paracrine cells were found only rarely in
the stomach (fig. 4g), whereas the chromogranin a-positive
enterochromaffin-like (ecl) cells of the oxyntic mucosa were
virtually all vmat2-positive (fig. 4h). in contrast, the majority of enterochromaffin (chromogranin a-positive) cells of
the small and large intestine were  xxxg2098xxx -positive (and
vmat2-negative), as shown for the duodenum (fig. 4 i and
j). in both stomach and duodenum the sympathetic nerve
terminals innervating blood vessels (fig. 4k) were invariably
vmat2-positive and  xxxg2098xxx -negative. vmat2, but not
 xxxg2098xxx , immunoreactivity was also prominent in endocrine
pancreas but was absent from exocrine pancreatic tissue (data
not shown).

discussion
the cloning of hvmat1 and hvmat2 has allowed characterization of "the pharmacology of the transporters and their
expression in cells that store biogenic amines in human tissues.
the expression of hvmat1 and hvmat2 is largely confined
to endocrine and neuronal cell populations, respectively. however, hvmat2 is also expressed in the ecl "histaminocytes"
in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, consistent with histamine's higher affinity for hvmat2 than hvmat1. vmat2
immunoreactivity is found in the histaminergic tuberomammillary neuronal cell bodies of the rat posterior hypothalamus
(7, 8). hvmat2 mrna has also previously been observed in
the human hypothalamus (17). furthermore, reserpinesensitive [3h]histamine transport by rat vmat2 is greater
than by rat  xxxg2098xxx  (8). thus, the affinity of histamine for
hvmat2 and the expression of hvmat2 in neurons and
endocrine cells that store and secrete histamine support the
notion that hvmat2 is the histamine vesicular transporter in
these cells.
over 50 years ago, it was shown that histamine was released
from the stomach during vagal stimulation and is involved in
the regulation of normal gastrosecretory function (18). identification of histaminocytes of the oxyntic mucosa in stomach
has been difficult, however, because of the reliance on antibodies directed to histamine itself (19). long-term inhibition
of gastric secretion by histamine receptor (h2) blockade or
proton secretion inhibitors results in ecl cell hyperplasia in
the gastric mucosa of the rat (20, 21). rindi and coworkers (22)
have pointed out an apparent increase in the number of cases
of chromogranin a-positive gastric ecl carcinomas within the
last decade in humans and speculated a link to chronic h2
receptor blocker treatment during this period. the identification of vmat2 as a "marker" for the ecl cells should greatly
facilitate investigation of this important cell population.
human sympathetic ganglion small intensely fluorescent
cells are  xxxg2098xxx -positive, and principal ganglion cells are
vmat2-positive, whereas chromaffin cells of the adrenal
medulla are both  xxxg2098xxx - and vmat2-positive. in contrast,
rodent chromaffin cells express predominantly  xxxg2098xxx  with
little expression of vmat2 (5, 7). because chromaffin cells

proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 93

(1996)

are believed to represent a non-endstage neuroendocrine
differentiation state (23), relatively subtle environmental differences in rodent and human adrenomedullary ontogenesis
may affect expression of vmat2 in chromaffin cells in these
two species. vmat2 expression may thus represent a useful
marker in the study of the sympathoadrenal lineage. likewise,
the characterization of the ontogeny and plasticity of the
hvmat2-expressing histaminocytes of the stomach and paracrine cells of the pancreas, and hvmat1-positive enterochromaffin cells of the digestive tract may provide insight into the
developmental and genetic regulation of  xxxg2098xxx  and
vmat2.
because  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 are expressed in all chromaffin cells of human adrenal medulla, both may be present on
chromaffin granules in both epinephrine- and norepinephrinestoring cells. transport into chromaffin granules may be more
efficient when vmat2 is expressed because the catecholamines have somewhat higher affinity for vmat2 than
 xxxg2098xxx . the possibilities of differential  xxxg2098xxx /vmat2
targeting to subpopulations of chromaffin granules, or differential targeting of  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 to chromaffin granules and synaptic-like microvesicles, in human adrenal medulla
remain open for investigation.
evaluation of the interactions of various amine-depleting
agents and neurotoxins with vmats provides insights into the
role of vesicular monoamine storage in the pharmacological
actions of these agents and structural features required for
their differential effects. reserpine and  xxxd2419xxx  potently
inhibit both hvmat1 and hvmat2 and define a high-affinity
monoamine uptake recognition site and a low-affinity monoamine binding site that may release amines into the vesicle
lumen, respectively (24, 25). like  xxxd2419xxx , [3h]tbzoh
binds to a low-affinity monoamine binding site of human and
bovine vmat2 (17,26). in contrast,  xxxd3330xxx  and [3h]tbzoh do
not interact with hvmat1 at all. the selective effect of  xxxd3330xxx 
on vmat2 may account for its efficacy in depleting central
monoamine stores in dyskinetic movement disorders (27).
indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines such as amphetamine and its substituted derivatives, mdma and fenfluramine, are known to be potent amine-releasing agents (28) and
particularly neurotoxic to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons of the central nervous system in rodents and primates
(29-32). the neuronal specificity of the amphetamines relies
on specific plasma membrane re-uptake transporters, which
selectively accumulate them into particular monoaminergic
nerve terminals. once inside the cell, these substrates compete
with monoamines for vesicular sequestration and ultimately
disrupt vesicular monoamine storage and hi electrochemical
gradients (30, 32-36). the potency of these compounds (,tm
range) and, in particular, the stereospecificity of the action of
amphetamine reported here, support a direct interaction with
vmat2 in vivo. although the potency of pea for vmat2 is
similar to that of the substituted amphetamines, the behavioral
and neurotoxic differences between these compounds may
relate to the presence of an a-methyl substituent on the
amphetamines that prevents degradation by monoamine oxidase (37). therefore, these compounds persist in the nerve
terminal and are more likely to release monoamines from
vesicular storage sites and exhaust metabolic energy in futile
maintenance of storage vesicle proton gradients. thus, their
intraneuronal actions, both psychopharmacologic and toxic,
may include the specific interaction of each agent with
vmat2.
the large decrease in potency (10- to 20-fold) of pea and
amphetamine compared with the moderate decrease seen with
the catecholamines and substituted amphetamines (2- to
4-fold) on [3h]5ht uptake mediated by  xxxg2098xxx  compared
with vmat2 suggest that the lack of strong electron-donating
substituents on the aromatic ring play an important role in the
differential apparent affinity for hvmat1 vs. hvmat2.

neurobiology: erickson et al.
decreased apparent affinity for  xxxg2098xxx  of substrates that lack
aromatic substituents is also exemplified by histamine, which
has a 30-fold lower apparent affinity for  xxxg2098xxx  than for
vmat2. interestingly, the presence of a trifluoromethyl moiety on the aromatic ring of (+) fenfluramine may impart the
selective increase in affinity for hvmat1 compared with
hvmat2 of this compound. the more potent stereoisomer
(+) dexfenf luramine, indicated as an anorectic drug, has
recently been shown to produce persistent deficits in serotonergic neuronal markers in the monkey central nervous system
when administered at relatively high doses (38). it may be
important to examine the effect of this drug on the hvmat1expressing enterochromaffin cells in the digestive tract characterized here.
mpp+ neurotoxicity is thought to be a useful model for
idiopathic parkinson's disease (39, 40). the transport of the
neurotoxin mpp+ into catecholaminergic neurons, in particular dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, by highaffinity plasma membrane re-uptake transporters results in
their degeneration (41). cell death is a result of accumulation
of mpp+ by mitochondria and ultimately inhibition of atp
synthesis (42). it has been demonstrated that sequestration of
mpp+ by chromaffin granules of adrenal medulla and pc12
cells protects these cells against the metabolic damage (42, 43).
the affinity of mpp+ for hvmat2 and the high level of
expression of hvmat2 in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra would suggest these neurons would also be
protected from mpp+. however, the metabolic and functional
compartmentation of the monoamines between vesicular and
cytoplasmic pools in dopaminergic vs. noradrenergic neurons
differ significantly (44). hence, a limited vesicular storage
capacity of dopaminergic synaptic vesicles, compared with
chromaffin"granules and noradrenergic dense-core granules,
may be insufficient to clear the cytoplasm of mpp+ in human
dopaminergic neurons and, therefore, render them more susceptible to neurotoxin damage.
