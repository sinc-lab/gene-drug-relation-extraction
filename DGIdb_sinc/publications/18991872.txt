dual dopamine (da)/serotonin (5-ht)–releasing agents are promising candidate medications for stimulant addiction and other disorders. however, certain 5-ht transporter
(sert) substrates are associated with development of idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension (ipah) and valvular heart disease (vhd). according to the “5-ht hypothesis,” sert substrates increase the risk for developing ipah and vhd by increasing
plasma 5-ht. to test this hypothesis directly, we determined the effects of acute and
chronic fenfluramine, and other sert ligands, on plasma 5-ht in male rats. for acute
treatments, rats received i.v. vehicle or test drug (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), and serial blood
samples were withdrawn. for chronic treatments, vehicle or test drug was infused via
osmotic minipump (3 and 10 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks. on the last day of infusion, rats received i.v. fenfluramine challenge (1 mg/kg), and serial blood samples were withdrawn.
plasma 5-ht was measured using ex vivo microdialysis in whole-blood samples. baseline plasma 5-ht was <1.0 nm. acute injection of fenfluramine or other sert substrates
caused large (up to 24-fold) dose-dependent increases in plasma 5-ht. chronic fenfluramine at 3 and 10 mg/kg/d produced 1.7- and 3.5-fold increases in baseline plasma
5-ht, while chronic fluoxetine had no effect. chronic infusions of fenfluramine or fluoxetine diminished the ability of acute fenfluramine to elevate dialysate 5-ht, and both
drugs markedly reduced whole-blood 5-ht. acute fenfluramine increases plasma 5-ht
to concentrations that are below the micromolar levels necessary to produce adverse
cardiovascular effects. chronic fenfluramine and fluoxetine have minimal effects on
plasma 5-ht, suggesting that the increased risk for ipah associated with fenfluramine
does not depend upon elevations in plasma 5-ht.

on public health through the spread of hiv1, hepatitis, and tuberculosis.2 despite the extent of stimulant abuse, development of medications to treat stimulant dependence has not
been successful.3 a number of investigators
have advocated the use of monoamine releasers [e.g., (+)-amphetamine] as “agonist”
therapies for stimulant dependence,4,5 and preclinical studies support this approach.6 negus
and mello,7 for example, demonstrated that
low doses of (+)-amphetamine decrease cocaine self-administration behavior in monkeys,

with minimal effects on food-maintained behavior. perhaps more importantly, grabowski
et al.8 and shearer et al.9 showed that a slowrelease preparation of (+)-amphetamine is an
effective treatment adjunct for reducing illicit cocaine use in cocaine-dependent human
patients.
one major impediment to the use of
amphetamine-type drugs as medications is
their high potential for abuse. a wealth of
information shows that transporter-mediated
release of dopamine (da) in the brain underlies the motor stimulant and addictive properties of drugs like amphetamine.10 we have
suggested the possibility of designing novel
monoamine releasers with reduced abuse potential: this could be accomplished by increasing potency at 5-ht transporters (sert) relative to potency at da transporters (dat).11
the rationale for this idea comes from the
knowledge that 5-ht-releasing agents like fenfluramine lack stimulant properties and are
not self-administered.12 additionally, fenfluramine antagonizes locomotor and rewarding
actions of da releasers.11,13,14 studies using coadministered phentermine and fenfluramine
demonstrate that simultaneous increases in extracellular 5-ht and da in the cns produce minimal motor activity14 and are not rewarding15 or reinforcing.16 furthermore, the
phentermine/fenfluramine mixture suppresses
cocaine self-administration in rodents and nonhuman primates.16,17 consistent with other
findings,18 the aforementioned data support the
hypothesis that elevations in synaptic 5-ht can
antagonize stimulant and reinforcing effects
mediated by elevations in synaptic da.19,20
two recent studies validate the hypothesis that 5-ht counteracts effects of da. in
one study, we identified a non-amphetamine
transporter substrate, pal-287 (1-napthyl-2aminopropane), which releases da and 5-ht
in vitro. systemic administration of pal-287 increases extracellular levels of da and 5-ht in
rat frontal cortex, with effects on 5-ht being
greater. pal-287 induces substantially less locomotor stimulation than (+)-amphetamine, a

269

drug which increases extracellular da much
more than 5-ht. pal-287 displays little or
no reinforcing properties in rhesus monkeys
trained to self-administer cocaine, while infusions of pal-287 produce dose-dependent
decreases in cocaine responding.21 in another
study, a series of amphetamine analogues was
tested for reinforcing potency and efficacy in
rhesus monkeys. all of the analogues have
equivalent substrate activity at dat, but vary
in potency at sert. among the compounds
tested, p- xxxd2589xxx  has the highest
potency at sert and displays the lowest reinforcing efficacy. these data support the notion
that 5-ht release can dampen reinforcing effects of concurrent da release.22
unfortunately, 5-ht-releasing agents are associated with a number of adverse effects of
their own.23 primarily on the basis of experience with fenfluramine, two cardiovascular side-effects must be addressed when 5ht releasers are developed as medications:
valvular heart disease (vhd) and idiopathic
pulmonary arterial hypertension (ipah). we
and others24,25 have reviewed the evidence
that fenfluramine-associated vhd is most
likely related to activation of  xxxg1114xxx  receptors located on heart valves. specifically, the
n -de-ethylated fenfluramine metabolite norfenfluramine is a potent and efficacious 5ht 2b agonist which causes mitogenesis. a role
for  xxxg1114xxx  receptors in vhd is supported
by data showing two medications that cause
this disease, carbergoline and pergolide, are
also  xxxg1114xxx  agonists (for review, see
roth25 ). further evidence for the  xxxg1114xxx  hypothesis comes from the work of
setola et al.,26 who demonstrated that 3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma),
and its n -demethylated metabolite 3,4methylenedioxyamphetamine (mda), are 5ht 2b receptor agonists that elicit prolonged
mitogenic responses in human valvular interstitial cells. as predicted by this study, chronic
mdma users are reported to display increased
valvular regurgitation when compared to control subjects.27

270

ipah is a rare and often fatal disease
of unknown etiology.28 epidemiologic data
show that fenfluramine, (+)-fenfluramine, and
aminorex are clearly associated with an increase in the occurrence of ipah.29,30 abenhaim et al.,30 for example, estimated that when
fenfluramine is taken for more than 3 months,
the risk of developing ipah is enhanced 23fold. results from a more recent study31 conducted in the united states demonstrate that
fenfluramine, but not phentermine, increases
the risk of ipah by about 7-fold. given that
ipah is usually an exceedingly rare disorder
with an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per million, several large studies would be needed to
accurately determine the risk posed by fenfluramine and (+)-fenfluramine. interestingly,
available evidence indicates that an “epidemic”
of ipah did not follow the widespread use of
fenfluramines in the 1990s.32 with the exception of a few isolated case reports,33,34 there
is currently no systematic evidence for an increased risk of ipah in patients receiving phentermine alone.
the mechanism by which fenfluramines increase the risk of developing ipah is not
known. fenfluramines evoke the release of 5ht from neurons by acting as sert substrates
that reverse the normal direction of transmitter flux.14 one prevailing hypothesis to explain fenfluramine-associated side-effects like
vhd35 and ipah36 is known as the “5-ht
hypothesis.” a key prediction of this hypothesis
is that fenfluramine increases plasma 5-ht to
concentrations sufficient to produce vasoconstriction and mitogenesis,37 which then leads to
the development of serious side-effects. despite
the importance of the 5-ht hypothesis for explaining the etiology of fenfluramine-associated
vhd and ipah, the effects of fenfluramine
and related agents on plasma 5-ht have received little attention. studies conducted in
the 1990s are not consistent with the 5-ht
hypothesis, since they show that acute fenfluramine does not increase plasma 5-ht in
rats,38 and chronic fenfluramine lowers blood
5-ht in humans (see rothman et al.39 and

annals of the new york academy of sciences

references therein). it is noteworthy that most
studies report plasma 5-ht levels at least 10
times higher than actual values (i.e., ∼1 nm),
perhaps reflecting the difficulties in preparing
plasma without platelet activation and subsequent 5-ht release.
given the uncertainties regarding the 5-ht
hypothesis, we developed a novel microdialysis
method to measure plasma levels of 5-ht in
whole-blood samples from conscious catheterized rats. the method involves careful acquisition and handling of blood samples to minimize
the chance of platelet activation or lysis.40,41
in this paper, we will review results obtained
using this method: we found that baseline
dialysate levels of 5-ht in blood range from
0.22 to 0.25 nm. when corrected for ∼25%
probe recovery, the calculated concentration of
plasma 5-ht ranges from 0.88 to 1.00 nm.
fenfluramine and other sert substrates evoke
transient dose-dependent increases in plasma
5-ht ranging from 4 to 24 nm. acute administration of fluoxetine, a sert uptake inhibitor, produces small but significant increases
in plasma 5-ht. we further observed that elevations in baseline plasma 5-ht produced by
chronic fenfluramine are well below the mum
levels necessary to produce cardiovascular sideeffects, suggesting that the 5-ht hypothesis can
not explain adverse actions of fenfluramines
and related drugs.41

methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (charles river
laboratories, wilmington, ma) weighing 350–
400 g were single-housed with food and water
freely available. rats were maintained in facilities accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal
care, and procedures were approved by the animal care and use committee of the national
institute on drug abuse (nida), intramural
research program (irp).

 xxxd2913xxx  (phentermine, fw = 185.7),
and pentobarbital sodium were obtained from
the nida, irp pharmacy.  xxxd2135xxx  (fluoxetine, fw = 345.8) was purchased from
spectrum chemical manufacturing company
(new brunswick, nj, usa). monochloroacetic
acid was obtained from mallinckrodt baker,
inc. (phillipsburg, nj, usa) and all other
reagents were obtained from sigma chemical
company (st. louis, mo, usa).
drug solutions for acute i.v. administration were prepared in sterile 0.9% nacl
(saline) solution immediately before use, and
doses are expressed as the salt. for filling osmotic minipumps, fenfluramine was dissolved
in saline to yield delivery of 3 or 10 mg/kg/d,
whereas fluoxetine was dissolved in a 50%
ethanol/0.9% saline (etoh/saline) vehicle to
yield delivery of 3 or 10 mg/kg/d. on the
day before implantation, minipumps were filled
with saline, etoh/saline, or appropriate drug
solution, and placed in a sterile saline bath at
37◦ c overnight.
surgical procedures
rats received sodium pentobarbital (60
mg/kg, i.p.) for surgical anesthesia. for acute
drug administration studies, i.v. catheters made
of silastic medical grade tubing (dow corning, midland, mi, usa) were inserted into
the right jugular vein and advanced to the
atrium according to published methods.42 for
chronic administration studies, i.v. catheters
were inserted into the right jugular vein as
noted above, and osmotic minipumps (alzet
model 2m l2 [14 days]; durect corp., cupertino, ca, usa) were implanted subcutaneously along the back, posterior to the base of

271

the shoulder blades. rats were allowed 1 week
to recover postoperatively prior to any other
procedures. in the acute studies, rats were used
in microdialysis experiments 8–10 days postoperatively. in the chronic studies, rats were
used in microdialysis experiments 14 days after
minipump implantation and were killed the following day. minipumps were removed and visually inspected to verify that they were empty.

in vivo drug administration
and microdialysis
on the day of microdialysis testing, rats were
moved from the vivarium to the testing room
in their home cages, and allowed to acclimate for 1 h. extension tubes were attached
to i.v. catheters, and 0.5 ml of heparin flush
(48 iu/ml in saline) was injected. blood samples (0.3 ml) were withdrawn into 1-ml syringes and transferred into 400-mul polypropylene vials chilled on ice. vials contained 20 mul
of heparin (1000 iu/ml in saline) as an anticoagulant. heparin flush was injected into rats
after each sample to maintain volume homeostasis. a 4 × 0.6 mm dialysis probe (mab
6; scipro, inc., sanborn, ny, usa) was immediately immersed in the chilled blood sample. ringer’s solution was pumped through the
probe at 1 mul/min, and each blood sample was dialyzed for 15 min to generate a
single dialysate sample. serial blood samples
were collected and dialyzed every 15 minutes.
dialysates were assayed for 5-ht and 5-hiaa
using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (hplcecd) as described below.
after 3–4 baseline samples were obtained
and dialyzed, drug treatments were administered through i.v. catheters. in the acute
studies, fenfluramine and other sert ligands
were administered as bolus injections of 0.3
or 1.0 mg/kg. saline was administered in a
volume of 1 ml/kg as a control, and separate control groups were included with each
sert drug tested. in the chronic studies, all

272

annals of the new york academy of sciences

rats received a challenge injection of fenfluramine, administered as a bolus injection of
1.0 mg/kg. blood samples were collected and
dialyzed every 15 min for 90 min post injection. probe recoveries were performed before
and after blood sampling using a 10-pg 5-ht
standard prepared in ringers’ solution.
analysis of 5-ht and 5-hiaa
in dialysates
aliquots of the dialysate (5 mul) were injected
onto a microbore hplc column (unijet, 100 ×
1 mm, 5 mum ods; bioanalytical systems, west
lafayette, in, usa) that was coupled to an
amperometric detector (model lc-4c, bas,
inc.). a glassy carbon electrode was set at a
potential of +650 mv relative to ag/agcl
reference. mobile phase consisted of 180 mum
na 2 edta, 150 mm monochloroacetic acid,
125 mm naoh, and 690 mum sodium octanesulfonic acid, with 7.5% meoh and 7.5%
ch 3 cn per liter of water (final ph = 3.15).
mobile phase was pumped through the column
at 60 mul/min (260d, syringe pump; teledyne
isco, lincoln, ne, usa). chromatographic
data were acquired online and exported to
a millennium software system (waters associates, milford, ma, usa) for peak amplification, integration, and analysis. the concentration of 5-ht and 5-hiaa in dialysate samples was compared to known standards, and
the lower limit of detection was 0.05 pg/5 mul
(∼0.048 nm) for both indoles.
measurement of blood 5-ht levels
in rats fitted with minipumps, blood samples (1.0 ml) were obtained via i.v. catheters at
7 and 13 days after pump implantation. blood
was transferred to glass tubes and allowed to
clot at room temperature. during clotting, the
vast majority of 5-ht stored in blood platelets
is released into the serum. therefore, we used
serum 5-ht as a measure of whole-blood 5ht. clotted blood was spun at 3,000 rpm for
10 min. serum was transferred to cryotubes
and stored at −80 ◦ c until analysis. serum

5-ht levels were determined using a commercially available double-antibody ria kit
(alpco diagnostics, salem, nh, usa). the
lower limit of assay sensitivity was 6.7 ng/ml,
and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was
6.10%.
measurement of blood fenfluramine
and fluoxetine levels
in rats fitted with minipumps, additional venous blood (1.5 ml) was obtained 13 days after
pump implantation to measure drug pharmacokinetics. this blood was transferred to cryotubes containing k 2 edta as an anticoagulant, calculated to give a final concentration of
1.8 mg/ml and stored at −80 ◦ c until analysis.
fenfluramine and norfenfluramine, or fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, were assayed in blood
by nms labs (willow grove, pa, usa) using gas chromatography. limits of quantitation were 10 ng/ml for fenfluramine and its
metabolite, and 20 ng/ml for fluoxetine and its
metabolite.
statistical analyses
for acute drug administration experiments,
the mean concentration of 5-ht determined
from two dialysate samples collected immediately before drug injection was considered
baseline. in this case, each rat served as its
own control, and dialysate levels of 5-ht are
mean ± sem expressed as percentage of preinjection baseline (% baseline, n = 6 rats/group).
for chronic drug administration experiments,
the mean concentration of 5-ht determined
from preinjection baseline samples collected
from all chronic saline rats (i.e., control for fenfluramine groups) or all chronic etoh/saline
rats (i.e., control for fluoxetine groups) was considered baseline. in this case, dialysate levels
of 5-ht are mean ± sem expressed as percentage of saline or etoh/saline baseline values (% baseline, n = 9 rats/group). for ria
data, serum 5-ht levels are mean ± sem expressed as percentage of saline or etoh/saline
control values (% control, n = 9 rats/group).

effects of acute drug administration
on plasma 5-ht
figure 1 shows the effects of acute i.v. drug
administration on peak plasma levels of 5-

ht, measured in the first 15-min sample collected post injection. the mean baseline level of
dialysate 5-ht was 0.22 ± 0.01 nm for all 108
rats used in the acute injection experiments.
when corrected for 25% probe recovery, true
baseline plasma 5-ht level was ∼0.88 nm.
all of the sert substrates produced significant dose-related elevations in dialysate
5-ht, except for phentermine, which increased dialysate 5-ht, but the effect did not
achieve statistical significance. fenfluramine
evoked significant increases in plasma 5-ht
(f [2,15] = 8.93, p < 0.001) that peaked
at 12- and 24-fold above baseline after 0.3

274

and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. the fenfluramineinduced rise in plasma 5-ht was transient, returning to baseline by 90 min post injection
(data not shown). administration of mdma
(f [2,15] = 11.39, p < 0.001) or methamphetamine (f [2,15] = 12.92, p < 0.001)
caused elevations in dialysate 5-ht comparable to effects of fenfluramine, with both
drug doses increasing 5-ht. amphetamine was
much less potent in this regard (f [2,15] = 4.24,
p < 0.05), and only the 1.0 mg/kg dose caused
a significant effect. acute administration of the
5-ht selective reuptake inhibitor (ssri) fluoxetine produced a smaller dose-dependent rise in
plasma 5-ht (f [2,15] = 21.45, p < 0.0001],
with 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg doses increasing 5-ht
levels 3.5- and 7-fold above baseline. dialysate
5-hiaa levels were not affected by any of the
sert ligands tested (data not shown).
the data depicted in figure 2 demonstrate
that effects of sert substrates on plasma 5ht are strongly correlated with their ability to
evoke efflux of [3 h]5-ht from synaptosomes
in vitro (pearson’s r = −0.946, p < 0.01). specifically, the peak effect of 1.0 mg/kg of each drug
on dialysate 5-ht was plotted against the corresponding ec 50 value for drug-induced release of neuronal [3 h]5-ht determined previously in our laboratory. of importance, the
significant negative correlation actually indicates a positive relationship, since ec 50 values
are inversely related to drug potency (i.e., low
ec 50 values indicate high potency). because
sert proteins expressed in platelets are identical to those expressed in neurons, these findings suggest that elevations in plasma 5-ht are
mediated via interactions of drugs with sert
proteins, most likely those expressed in blood
platelets.

dialysate 5-ht was 0.25 ± 0.05 nm for n = 9
rats. when corrected for 25% probe recovery,
the actual plasma 5-ht value was ∼1.00 nm.
chronic administration of fenfluramine for 14
days of osmotic minipump infusion significantly increased baseline dialysate 5-ht in
blood (f [2,24] = 6.58, p < 0.01). specifically,
fenfluramine elevated baseline 5-ht levels to
1.7- and 3.5-fold above chronic saline control
levels after 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg/d doses, respectively. chronic fenfluramine significantly
and dose-dependently reduced the ability of
acute i.v. fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) to increase
plasma 5-ht (f [2,24] = 3.69, p < 0.01). acute
administration of fenfluramine elevated extracellular 5-ht levels to 17-fold above baseline
in chronic saline control rats, as compared to
10- and 7-fold elevations after chronic exposure to 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg/d fenfluramine,
respectively.
in rats chronically exposed to etoh/saline
vehicle (i.e., vehicle for fluoxetine), baseline
dialysate 5-ht was 0.23 ± 0.03 nm for n =
9 rats, or plasma levels of ∼0.92 nm when
corrected for probe recovery. chronic administration of fluoxetine for 14 days of osmotic
minipump infusion did not change baseline

effects of chronic drug administration
on blood 5-ht
figure 4 demonstrates the effect of chronic
administration of fenfluramine or fluoxetine on

276

5-ht levels in whole blood. in rats chronically
exposed to saline for 7 days, the baseline control level of 5-ht in serum was 1439 ± 68
ng/ml (n = 9 rats). chronic administration
of fenfluramine significantly reduced blood 5ht (f [2,24] = 14.46, p < 0.001) to 60% of
saline control values, when measured 7 days
after minipump implantation. similar reductions were observed at day 13 (f [2,24] = 18.08,
p < 0.001). the fenfluramine-induced reduction in blood 5-ht was not dose-dependent,
indicating that the ability of fenfluramine to
deplete platelet 5-ht had already reached a
maximal effect at the 3 mg/kg/d dose. in
rats chronically exposed to etoh/saline vehicle for 7 days, the baseline control level of
5-ht in serum was 1516 ± 77 ng/ml (n = 9
rats). chronic fluoxetine dose-dependently and
significantly reduced blood 5-ht (f [2,24] =
75.71, p < 0.0001) to 60% (3 mg/kg/d) and
25% (10 mg/kg/d) of control, when measured
7 days after minipump implantation. this
fluoxetine-induced reduction in blood 5-ht
was sustained up to day 13 (f [2,24] = 57.91,
p < 0.0001).
as suggested by the correlation data in figure 2, acute effects of fenfluramine (and other
sert substrates) on plasma 5-ht most likely
involve sert-mediated release of 5-ht from
platelets.40 since the vast majority of blood 5ht is sequestered in platelets, we predicted that
peak increases in plasma 5-ht produced by
acute fenfluramine should be correlated with
blood 5-ht content. accordingly, the data in
figure 5 demonstrate that fenfluramine-evoked
increases in dialysate 5-ht are strongly and significantly correlated with blood 5-ht levels. in
rats chronically treated with fenfluramine, peak
dialysate 5-ht was positively correlated with
blood 5-ht (r = 0.495, p < 0.01). likewise, in
rats chronically treated with fluoxetine, this positive correlation was even stronger (r = 0.805,
p < 0.001). such correlative relationships indicate that the magnitude of fenfluramine-evoked
increases in plasma 5-ht is at least partially
dependent on platelet 5-ht levels available for
release.

blood levels of drugs and metabolites
we measured blood levels of fenfluramine,
fluoxetine, and their major metabolites after 13 days of chronic administration. blood
concentrations of fenfluramine increased significantly (p < 0.0001) from 55 ng/ml after the 3 mg/kg/d dose, to 212 ng/ml with
10 mg/kg/d. blood levels of norfenfluramine
also increased (p < 0.0001) from 19 to 115
ng/ml after the 3 and 10 mg/kg/d treatments. it should be noted that plasma levels
of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine in rats receiving 3 mg/kg/d fenfluramine are similar to

rothman et al.: serotonin (5-ht) transporter drugs and plasma 5-ht

those reported in humans taking daily doses of
60 mg fenfluramine.39
after 13 days of chronic administration
of fluoxetine, the fluoxetine blood concentration was significantly increased (p < 0.016)
from 11 ng/ml after the 3 mg/kg/d dose, to
113 ng/ml with the 10 mg/kg/d dose. similarly, blood levels of norfluoxetine were also
significantly increased (p < 0.0006) from 74
to 795 ng/ml with the 3 and 10 mg/kg/d
treatments. the plasma levels of fluoxetine
and norfluoxetine observed in rats receiving 10
mg/kg/d are similar to those reported in humans taking daily doses of 20 mg fluoxetine.43
discussion
in the present study, we examined the effects of fenfluramine and related sert ligands on concentrations of plasma 5-ht in
conscious catheterized rats. a major technical
challenge for these experiments was obtaining
plasma samples that were not contaminated
with platelet 5-ht. more than 99% of 5-ht
in blood is sequestered in platelets, and “free”
plasma 5-ht concentrations are maintained
at <1 nm by sert-mediated uptake of 5ht into platelets, lung endothelium, and other
cells.44 when plasma samples are prepared for
analysis, even minor perturbation of platelets
can cause activation or lysis, leading to massive
5-ht release.45 the ex vivo microdialysis technique that we developed40 avoids the problem
of platelet activation because blood samples
are obtained via indwelling catheters, gently
transferred to microvials, and not subjected to
centrifugation. we measured baseline dialysate
levels of 5-ht in blood ranging from 0.22 to
0.25 nm, which translates to actual plasma levels of 0.88 to 1.00 nm when corrected for 25%
probe recovery. the concentrations of plasma
5-ht that we measured in rats are similar to
those found in humans, which are typically
<1 nm.37 many investigations have reported
baseline plasma levels of 5-ht much higher
than 1 nm, and this likely reflects contami-

277

nation of plasma samples with 5-ht released
from platelets. for instance, a previous study
that examined the effect of chronic administration of (+)-fenfluramine on plasma 5-ht in
rats noted plasma levels 10 times higher than
normal.46 the results from studies reporting
baseline plasma 5-ht levels greater than 1 nm
should be interpreted with caution.
we found that acute i.v. administration of
fenfluramine or other sert substrates caused
dose-dependent elevations in plasma 5-ht
ranging from 4- to 24-fold above baseline
(fig. 1). the increases in plasma 5-ht were
transient and returned to normal within 60–
90 min. given that baseline 5-ht concentrations were around 1 nm, the peak concentrations reached 24 nm after i.v. injections of
potent sert substrates. of importance, druginduced elevations in plasma 5-ht are significantly correlated with the ability of drugs to
evoke release of [3 h]5-ht from synaptosomes
in vitro (fig. 2). fenfluramine, mdma, and
methamphetamine are known to release [3 h]5ht from neurons by a transporter-dependent
mechanism. since neurons and blood platelets
express identical sert proteins,47 our correlation data suggest the involvement of platelet
sert in mediating drug-induced elevations
in plasma 5-ht. early in vitro studies demonstrated that fenfluramine is capable of releasing radiolabeled 5-ht from platelets.48,49 we
have shown previously that in vitro incubation
of fenfluramine or other sert substrates with
rat blood will increase plasma 5-ht, confirming that the molecular machinery for elevating
plasma 5-ht is found in blood and does not
require other tissues.40 taken together, the findings demonstrate that fenfluramine and other
amphetamine analogues increase plasma 5-ht
by a mechanism involving sert-mediated release of 5-ht from platelets.
the elevations in plasma 5-ht produced by
acute administration of fenfluramine are below
the mum concentrations required to cause mitogenesis and vasoconstriction.50,51 additionally, acute effects of sert substrates described
here are probably not relevant to the use of

278

serotonergic medications, since we administered i.v. bolus injections rather than oral drug
doses. on the other hand, large increases in
plasma 5-ht might be clinically relevant in
circumstances where illicit sert substrates
like methamphetamine are self-administered
by the i.v. or smoked routes.52 in that case,
extremely high drug levels are present in the
bloodstream and could evoke substantial elevations in plasma 5-ht similar to, or greater
than, those shown here. a recent clinical study
reported that methamphetamine abuse is associated with a marked increase in the incidence
of ipah.53 while more investigation is required
to validate this observation, we have speculated
that sert proteins are involved in the mechanism of ipah associated with illicit methamphetamine use.54 it is well established that all
of the anorectic agents associated with ipah
in humans are amphetamine-type sert substrates,55 and methamphetamine is now added
to the list of potential causative agents.
from a medication development standpoint,
a more important question is whether chronic
administration of sert ligands will raise baseline concentrations of plasma 5-ht. to address
this question, fenfluramine or the ssri fluoxetine were administered for two weeks via
subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. we found
that chronic fenfluramine increased baseline
plasma concentrations of 5-ht by 1.7 and 3.5fold after 3 and 10 mg/kg/d doses, respectively (fig. 3). our findings agree with those
of eddahibi et al., who showed that chronic
fenfluramine administration elevates plasma 5ht to about five-fold in hypoxic rats.56 in
contrast, chronic fluoxetine had no effect on
plasma 5-ht, and this finding agrees with the
work of others.57 given that baseline concentrations of plasma 5-ht were around 1 nm,
actual increases in plasma 5-ht ranged from
2 to 4 nm after chronic fenfluramine. interestingly, chronic exposure to fenfluramine or
fluoxetine rendered rats less much sensitive to
the acute 5-ht-releasing properties of acute
fenfluramine. thus, chronic administration of
sert substrates or ssris serves to reduce

annals of the new york academy of sciences

the spikes in plasma 5-ht produced by acute
fenfluramine.
chronic administration of fenfluramine and
fluoxetine significantly depleted whole-blood 5ht, with the effects of fluoxetine being much
greater. these data agree with previous findings demonstrating that fenfluramine can reduce whole-blood 5-ht in rats,46 monkeys,58
and humans.59,60 likewise, chronic exposure to
fluoxetine is known to decrease whole-blood 5ht in rats57 and platelet 5-ht in humans.61,62
the correlation data in figure 5 show that
fenfluramine-induced increases in plasma 5ht are at least partially dependent on wholeblood levels of 5-ht. therefore, in rats chronically treated with fenfluramine, reductions in
evoked 5-ht release may be secondary to the
diminished pool of releasable 5-ht in platelets.
in rats chronically treated with fluoxetine the
situation is probably more complicated. in
these rats, reduction in evoked 5-ht release
could be secondary to depleted platelet 5-ht,
occupancy of platelet sert sites by fluoxetine
and its metabolite norfluoxetine, and downregulation of sert.63,64
our chronic administration data have potential clinical implications with regard to mechanisms of vhd and ipah. we are not aware
of any data showing that chronic administration of fenfluramine induces either vhd65
or ipah in rats.66 by contrast, experimental and pathologic elevations of blood 5-ht
can produce vhd with characteristic plaquelike encasement of valve leaflets in humans67
and rats.68 in particular, gustafsson et al. reported that chronic administration of highdose exogenous 5-ht produces vhd.68 in
that study, “free” 5-ht was measured using in
vivo microdialysis probes placed in the femoral
muscle. probe placement in peripheral veins
was not possible because of 5-ht-induced vasodilatation. nonetheless, interstitial concentrations of 5-ht in muscle were assumed to
reflect plasma 5-ht, but probably underestimated the actual nm concentration. free 5-ht
levels ranged from 580 nm to 974 nm when
corrected for 31% probe recovery, depending

rothman et al.: serotonin (5-ht) transporter drugs and plasma 5-ht

on the sampling time. these values are at least
100-fold higher than the 5-ht levels (∼4 nm)
observed after chronic fenfluramine treatment
in our study. gustafsson et al.68 also reported
that chronic administration of 5-ht increased
whole-blood 5-ht by 3-fold, from 6986 nm
to 21,236 nm. in our study, as expected on
the basis of previous work mentioned above,
chronic fenfluramine decreased whole blood 5ht by 40% at the 3- and 10-mg/kg/d doses
(fig. 4). these considerations support the hypothesis that chronic fenfluramine does not increase plasma or blood 5-ht to levels required
to cause vhd in the rat. it is important to note,
however, that gustafsson et al.68 did not determine the minimal dose of exogenous 5-ht required to produce vhd in rats, and this gap in
information warrants further investigation.
several studies report that carcinoid syndrome, a disease associated with vhd, causes
marked increases in platelet 5-ht. kema et al.69
reported that patients with midgut carcinoid tumors had median platelet 5-ht levels of 31.45
(nmol/109 platelets) as compared to 4.4 in normal controls (7.1-fold increase). in a later study,
the same group reported that patients with
midgut carcinoid tumors had median platelet
5-ht levels of 23.8 (nmol/109 platelets) as
compared to 3.4 in normal controls (7.0-fold increase).70 a similar 8.6-fold increase in platelet
5-ht was reported by others.71 robiolio et al.67
reported that patients with carcinoid syndrome
and vhd had higher serum and platelet 5-ht
levels than carcinoid patients without vhd.
the serum and platelet 5-ht levels in carcinoid patients with vhd were elevated 11.5fold and 6.6-fold, respectively, as compared to
normal controls. the large increases in platelet
and blood 5-ht observed in the carcinoid
syndrome and in the rat study conducted by
gustafsson et al.68 would be expected to produce correspondingly large increases in plasma
5-ht. in our study, chronic fenfluramine at a
dose (3 mg/kg/d) similar to that used therapeutically in humans, decreases blood 5-ht levels
by 40% and increases plasma 5-ht by less than
2-fold, supporting the hypothesis that chronic

279

fenfluramine does not increase plasma 5-ht
(or blood 5-ht) to a level reported to cause
vhd in the humans. these results are similar
to those observed in rats chronically exposed to
hypoxic conditions.56
viewed collectively, these findings are not
compatible with the so-called “5-ht hypothesis” of fenfluramine-associated vhd. this hypothesis postulates that fenfluramine increases
the risk of developing vhd by increasing
plasma levels of 5-ht.35,36 although the 5-ht
hypothesis may have been tenable as an explanation of fenfluramine-associated vhd at one
point, recent studies implicate drug-induced
activation of  xxxg1114xxx  receptors, rather than 5ht per se, in the pathogenesis of this disease.72
medications that are known to induce vhd
such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine,  xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine, pergolide, and cabergoline
share a common mechanism—namely, these
drugs or their major metabolites are potent and
efficacious  xxxg1114xxx  agonists.  xxxg1114xxx  receptors
are expressed on heart valve cells. when these
receptors are stimulated, cells undergo mitogenesis that leads to excessive growth, culminating in valvulopathy (for review, see roth25 ).
given the adverse effects associated with 5ht 2b receptor stimulation, future medication
development efforts should ensure that potential drug candidates are devoid of  xxxg1114xxx  agonist activity.
our chronic treatment data may have more
important relevance for hypotheses concerning
the etiology of ipah. epidemiologic studies indicate that fenfluramine increases the risk of
developing ipah.30,31 the 5-ht hypothesis is
also invoked as a potential pathogenic mechanism of fenfluramine-associated iaph.35,36
the pathogenesis of ipah is complex and difficult to study, especially given the rarity of the
disorder. nonetheless, numerous investigations
implicate the involvement of 5-ht and sert
proteins in the pathogenesis of ipah.36,73 this
hypothesis postulates that fenfluramine exposure increases the risk of developing ipah
by increasing plasma levels of 5-ht, which
then causes contraction of pulmonary arteries,

280

leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension and
hyperplasia of the small pulmonary arteries.
our data indicate that fenfluramine does not
increase plasma 5-ht to a high enough concentration to contract pulmonary arteries. our
microdialysis methods showed that chronic fenfluramine, but not chronic fluoxetine, increased
baseline plasma 5-ht by 2- to 4-fold, indicating that the 5-ht plasma concentration is
less than 5 nm (accounting for probe recovery). 5-ht provokes contraction of human pulmonary arteries with ec 50 values ranging from
100 nm to 10 mum.51 the threshold concentration for 5-ht-stimulated mitogenic responses
in cultured human pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cells (smcs) is about 10 nm,74,75 although much higher (∼100 nm) 5-ht concentrations are needed to stimulate mitogenic
responses in rat pulmonary artery smcs.76,77
thus, the concentrations of plasma 5-ht after chronic administration of fenfluramine are
below those required for adverse pulmonary effects. we cannot exclude the possibility that 2to 4-fold increases in plasma 5-ht produced
by chronic fenfluramine could be enough to
stimulate mitogenic responses in susceptible individuals and increase the risk of developing
ipah. however, this scenario seems unlikely
since treatment with lithium78 and mao inhibitors79 produces comparable elevations in
plasma 5-ht without increasing the risk for
ipah.
recent studies by eddahibi et al.73 focus
attention on 5-ht produced in lung endothelial cells as a critical player in smc hyperplasia and pathogenesis of ipah. these investigators reported that endothelial cells in
the pulmonary microvasculature synthesize 5ht, which is then released as a growth factor. it has been proposed that dysregulation
of 5-ht production in endothelial cells, along
with overexpression of sert by the pulmonary
artery smcs, contributes to the hyperplasia observed in ipah. immunohistochemical studies show that pulmonary microvascular endothelium do not express sert,73 suggesting
that fenfluramine could not release 5-ht from

annals of the new york academy of sciences

these cells. on the basis of the findings of eddahibi et al.,73 administration of the 5-ht precursor, l-5-hydroxytryptophan, would be predicted to increase 5-ht synthesis in pulmonary
endothelial cells since this compound bypasses
the rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. l-5-hydroxytryptophan is a commonly
used dietary supplement with a well-established
history of safety,80 and its use is not known to
increase the risk of ipah. although speculative, this observation suggests that an increase
in 5-ht synthesis in the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells may be necessary, but
not sufficient to increase the risk of ipah.
the mechanisms underlying fenfluramineassociated ipah in humans remain enigmatic.
one significant problem is that widely used animal models of ipah require the induction of
hypoxia, which is not a major contributing factor to the disease in human patients. furthermore, the etiology of fenfluramine-associated
ipah in humans may differ substantially from
that of non–drug-related ipah. despite these
caveats, recent research has provided alternatives to the “5-ht hypothesis” to explain how
fenfluramine might increase the risk of ipah.
for example, launay et al.81 have suggested that
activation of  xxxg1114xxx  receptors in the lung is
critical to the development of ipah in a hypoxic mouse model. since the fenfluramine
metabolite, norfenfluramine, is a potent and
selective  xxxg1114xxx  agonist,72 these findings provide a reasonable mechanism by which fenfluramine could increase the risk of ipah in
humans. arguing against this hypothesis is the
fact that other medications ( xxxd2621xxx , ergotamine, pergolide, cabergoline) known to produce vhd via activation of  xxxg1114xxx  receptors
are not associated with an increased risk of
ipah.
recent findings from our laboratory also
refute the role of  xxxg1114xxx  sites in anorecticassociated ipah.24 aminorex is a sert substrate that caused an epidemic of ipah in the
1960s,82 and case reports implicate the related
designer drug, 4-methylaminorex, as a potential cause of the disease.83 if  xxxg1114xxx  receptors

rothman et al.: serotonin (5-ht) transporter drugs and plasma 5-ht

are involved in the pathogenesis of aminorexassociated ipah, then aminorex should target  xxxg1114xxx  sites. while aminorex does interact with cloned human  xxxg1114xxx  receptors,
its potency for  xxxg1114xxx  activation
(870 nm) is 33 times weaker than its potency for ne release (26.4 nm). moreover,
the activity of aminorex at  xxxg1114xxx  sites is
nearly 50-fold less than the  xxxg1114xxx  agonist
(+)-norfenfluramine. chlorphentermine is a
substituted amphetamine analogue that causes
ipah in animal models, and this drug has negligible affinity for 5-ht 2 receptor subtypes.24
collectively, the data argue against an important role for  xxxg1114xxx  receptors in the pathogenesis of anorectic-associated ipah. on the
other hand, it seems feasible that metabolites of
aminorex or chlorphentermine may act more
potently at  xxxg1114xxx  receptors, and this possibility deserves to be examined.
nearly a decade ago, we suggested that
sert proteins play a pivotal role in the development of fenfluramine-associated ipah.55
specifically, we hypothesized that sert proteins serve as gateways for the accumulation of
fenfluramine, or other sert substrates, into
pulmonary smcs. once internalized, drug
molecules become trapped, intracellular drug
concentrations rise, and deleterious effects such
as mitogenesis ensue. a number of recent observations support our original “gateway hypothesis.” in the hypoxic mouse model of ipah,
enhanced expression of sert exacerbates mitogenesis in pulmonary smcs,77 whereas genetic deletion of sert has protective effects.84
pharmacologic blockade of sert sites by treatment with ssris can diminish the symptoms of ipah in experimental rodent models74,85 and in human patients.86 these data
verify the importance of sert in the development of ipah.66 other studies show that
(+)-fenfluramine is internalized into cells by a
sert-dependent mechanism, and the drug itself can stimulate mitogenesis via an intracellular 5-ht receptor-mediated mechanism.87
given that chronic exposure to fenfluramine
fails to elevate plasma 5-ht above low nm

281

concentrations in rats41 and humans,39 it seems
that fenfluramine and its metabolites are causing ipah, rather than 5-ht per se. thus, the
gateway hypothesis remains a tenable explanation for the mechanism underlying anorecticassociated ipah.
in summary, the data presented here show
that acute i.v. injections of sert substrates
can elevate plasma 5-ht into the low nm
range (∼24 nm). however, chronic administration of fenfluramine at therapeutically relevant doses produces only 2-fold elevations in
baseline plasma 5-ht and reduces the ability of acute fenfluramine to increase plasma
5-ht. these findings indicate that daily administration of fenfluramine in humans would
actually blunt fenfluramine-induced peaks in
plasma 5-ht. most importantly, the elevations
in baseline plasma 5-ht produced by chronic
fenfluramine are too low to induce adverse cardiovascular effects. thus, the “5-ht hypothesis” cannot explain the ability of fenfluramine
and other sert substrates to increase the risk
of vhd and ipah. in the case of vhd, activation of  xxxg1114xxx  receptors by norfenfluramine
is now considered a major factor causing the
disease. for ipah, the etiology is still unresolved, but sert-mediated internalization of
drug molecules is an attractive hypothesis that
deserves further inquiry. on the basis of the information available, we propose that new candidate medications targeting sert proteins
should: (1) be devoid of  xxxg1114xxx  agonist effects and (2) be non-amphetamine compounds to avoid the problems associated with
the phenylethylamine structure.
