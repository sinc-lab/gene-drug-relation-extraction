abstract-the kci contracted rat aorta is relaxed by  xxxd3017xxx ,
(&)-, (+)- and (-)- xxxd2957xxx . the relaxations to  xxxd3017xxx . but not
to (i)- xxxd2957xxx , were prevented by 1ci 118,551 at
m . the
relaxations to ( & )-pindolo1are, therefore, not due to [j-adrenoceptor agonism. at lo-’ m ici 118,551, (&)-, (+)-and (-)-pindolo1
were p2-adrenoceptor antagonists as they inhibited the relaxant
responses of the aorta to  xxxd3017xxx .
( f)-pindolo1 is classified as a p-adrenoceptor antagonist which
also exerts partial agonism at [hdrenoceptors (fitzgerald 1984).
p- adrenoceptor antagonists with partial agonism have the
potential to cause both vasodilation and vasoconstriction by
acting as agonists and antagonists at b-adrenoceptors, respectively. the vasodilator and vasoconstrictor activity of ( + ) - and
( -)-pindolo1 have not been determined. the present study has
examined the effects of (&)-. (+)- and (-)-pindolo1 on the rat
isolated aorta and their ability to cause a small relaxation of the
kci contracted preparation. the effects of  xxxd2316xxx  118,551 (a padrenoceptor antagonist) on these relaxations were also examined. finally, the effects of (&)-, (+)- and ( - ) -pindolo1 on the
relaxant responses of the rat aorta to  xxxd3017xxx  (a potent and
selective p2-adrenoceptor agonist, o’donnell & wanstall 1985)
were investigated.

materials and methods
male wistar rats (250-350 g) were stunned and exsanguinated.
the thoracic aorta was removed and placed in krebs solution.
all experiments were performed in the presence of a modified
krebs solution [composition (mm): nacl 116, kci 5.4. caclz
2.5, mgc12 1.2, nahp04 i .2, nahcoi 22.0. d-glucose 1 1.2, naz
edta 0.041 which was bubbled with 5% coz in oxygen at 37 c.
contractile responses were measured isometrically with force
displacement transducers (grass model fto 3c) and displayed
on a polygraph (grass model 79b). in each series ofexperiments,
the groups of individual values obtained were compared by
student’s paired t-test and were considered to be significantly
different when p<:0.05. mean values fs.e.m. were also
obtained.
a ring of rat aorta was suspended between stainless steel
hooks under 1 g tension in 5 ml organ baths containing krebs
solution. tissues were equilibrated for 30 rnin before exposure to
phenoxybenzamine at 5 x lo-’ m for 30 min to block ?adrenoceptors and extraneuronal uptake. tissues were washed
for 20 rnin and then contracted by 2 150 mg by the addition of
kci to the organ bath to give a final concentration of 2-3 x 10m . when the contraction was constant, three series of experiments were performed.
the effects of‘ xxxd2957xxx  alone compared with those ofprocaterol. a
cumulative challenge with  xxxd3017xxx , (*)-, (+)- or (-) xxxd2957xxx   xxxd1891xxx -9/10-8-10-5/10-4 m was made on a 4 min cycle.

undpindolol. a 10 min challenge to  xxxd3017xxx  or (k)-pindolo1 at
m was made. tissues were then washed for 60 rnin in the
absence or presence of ici 118,551  xxxd1891xxx - m before recontract-

ing the rat aorta with kci to a constant level and then repeating
the challenge to  xxxd3017xxx  or  xxxd2957xxx .
the efects of ici 118,551 and  xxxd2957xxx  on  xxxd3017xxx  response
curzvs. three successive challenges of the kci contracted aorta
with  xxxd3017xxx  produced identical relaxant curves (doggrell
1988). each aorta was initially given a cumulative 4 rnin cycle
challenge with  xxxd3017xxx  in the absence of drugs. tissues were
then equilibrated for 45 rnin in the presence of ici 118.551 or
 xxxd2957xxx  before the  xxxd3017xxx  challenge was repeated on the
recontracted aorta. tissues were then equilibrated for a further
45 min in the presence of a higher concentration of drug being
tested, before a third contraction with kci and challenge with
 xxxd3017xxx .
a.s.scs.sn~rnt u f ’ dutu. the maximal decrease in contractile response to each concentration of  xxxd3017xxx  or  xxxd2957xxx  was
measured. these relaxant responses were calculated as a percentage of the kci contraction. when successive  xxxd3017xxx 
relaxant curves were obtained. if the maximal relaxant responses
to  xxxd3017xxx  expressed as a percentage of the kci contraction
were not significantly different between curves, all the relaxant
responses were calculated as a percentage of the maximal
relaxant response to  xxxd3017xxx  i.e. normalized. for each
normalized concentration-response curve, a slope and pd2 value
was determined. the slope of the  xxxd3017xxx  response curve
(difference in percentage maximum of the responselunit of
logarithm molar concentration of  xxxd3017xxx ) and pd2 value
were computed by regression line analysis over the steepest part
of the response curve, which was usually between 20- 80% of the
maximum response. for each tissue, the ability of the drug to
alter responses to an agonist was expressed as the concentration
ratio at 50% relaxation (the antilogarithm of the difference
between the pd2 values in the presence and absence of the drug).
when the effects of a drug were apparently compatible with
competitive antagonism (i.e. there was no significant difference
between the slopes of the response curves but a significant
reduction in the pd2 values obtained after the addition of
antagonist) pa? values were determined. for each tissue a pa:
value was calculated from the formula p a ~ = p a , + l o g ( x - 1 )
where pa, is the negative logarithm of the molar concentration
of drug and x is the agonist concentration ratio at 50’%
relaxation.

was significantly more potent than ( f)- or (-)-pindolo1 as a p 2 adrenoceptor antagonist ( p i0.05).
( f)-pindolo1 decreases total peripheral resistance in man
(atterhog et al 1976; velasco et a1 1980). a study of the effect of
(+)-and (-)-pindolo1 on the dog isolated mesenteric artery has
shown that (+)- and (-)-pindolo1 are equieffective vasodilators
(clark & bertholet 1983). the present study, using the rat aorta,
confirms that (k)-,(+)- and (-)-pindolo1 are equipotent
vasorelaxants.
it has been suggested that the vasodilation observed with ( f) xxxd2957xxx  may be due to agonism a t /i>-adrenoceptors(fitzgerald
1984). however, clark & bertholet (1983) noted that the
evidence for this was incomplete and inconclusive. thus
although propranolol, a nonselective p-adrenoceptor antagonist, did inhibit the vasodilator action of  xxxd2957xxx  in the dog
mesenteric artery, the concentration required to produce a
measurable displacement of the dose-response curve for pindolo1 (i.e.
m propranolol) produced a much greater inhibition
of the responses to  xxxd2398xxx . 1ci 118,551 is a selective j2adrenoceptor antagonist having a pa2 of 8.7 at p 2 - (guinea-pig
trachea) and 7.0 at pi-adrenoceptors (guinea-pig atria, o'donnell & wanstall 1980). the rat aorta contains both pi- and p2adrenoceptors mediating relaxation with the pi-adrenoceptors
being the minor population (o'donnell & wanstall 1984).
 xxxd3017xxx  is a highly selective p2-adrenoceptor agonist which
relaxes the kci-contracted rat aorta (o'donnell & wanstall
1985, and this study). the present study illustrates that 1ci
118,551 inhibits the  xxxd3017xxx  response curves of the rat aorta
with a pa2 of 8.9. however, the relaxation to (f)- xxxd2957xxx  was
not prevented by pretreatment with ici 118,551 at
m, a
concentration that would produce antagonism at pi- and /i>adrenoceptors. consequently it is unlikely that these relaxations
