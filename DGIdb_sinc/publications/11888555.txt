abstract
the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor is targeted by several new antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine, and  xxxd3195xxx . we studied the effect of sb271046 [5-chloro-n-(4-methoxy-3- xxxd2960xxx -1-yl-phenyl)-3-methyl-2-benzothiophenesulfonamide], a specific  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist, in
three models for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia—d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and d-amphetamine- or phencyclidine
(pcp)-disrupted prepulse inhibition (ppi). we also tested this compound in a model for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, pcpdisrupted social interaction (sit) in rats. induction of side effects by this compound was evaluated by testing its potency to reduce
spontaneous motility, and to induce catalepsy in rats. the effect of sb-271046 was compared to clozapine in all models tested. this study
showed that sb-271046 had no beneficial effect in pcp-disrupted sit. however, sb-271046 dose-dependently normalised d-amphetaminedisrupted ppi, but did not reverse pcp-disrupted ppi. in addition, sb-271046 did not antagonise d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
thus, this specific  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist was associated with a clear positive outcome in only one model for the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia, and had no beneficial effect in the model for negative symptoms. consequently, it is clear that sb-271046 is not expected to
have an antipsychotic efficacy, at least when given as monotherapy. d 2002 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor is targeted by several second-generation antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine, and
 xxxd3195xxx  (roth et al., 1994; arnt and skarsfeldt, 1998), but
also by some classical antipsychotics (roth et al., 1994). in
in vitro assays, clozapine has been shown to down-regulate
the expression of the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor (frederick and meador-woodruff, 1999) and  xxxg1119xxx  receptor density (zhukovskaya and neumaier, 2000). this receptor is of additional
interest because of its specific expression in the cns
(monsma et al., 1993). immunohistological studies have
demonstrated that the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor is localised at the level
of the cortex (frontal and entorhinal), the nucleus accumbens, the striatum, and the hippocampus of rats (gérard et al.,
1997; hamon et al., 1999). this localisation suggests a
possible beneficial role for the treatment of schizophrenia.
however, the role per se of this receptor in the clinical action

of antipsychotics is still unknown (see, for review, branchek
and blackburn, 2000). pharmacological studies with compounds having a moderate affinity (pki = 7.3) for the  xxxg1119xxx 
receptor (ro 04-6790) (sleight et al., 1998) but poor brain
penetrability ( < 1%) (or studies with oligonucleotide antisense for the receptor) have suggested that this receptor
could be of interest for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions via its regulation of the activity of the cholinergic
system (bourson et al., 1995, 1998). studies with antisense
oligonucleotide technologies have also suggested that this
receptor could mediate anxiety responses (otano et al., 1999;
yoshioka et al., 1998), and could be involved in the regulation of body weight via modulation of feeding (bentley et
al., 1997). however, no preclinical studies have demonstrated the effect or lack of effects of a  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist
in models related to schizophrenia.
this lack of knowledge is largely due to a lack of potent
and selective  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonists. recently, however, smithkline beecham have generated series of  xxxg1119xxx 
receptor antagonists, sb-271046 [5-chloro-n-(4-methoxy-3piperazin-1-yl-phenyl)-3-methyl-2-benzothiophenesulfonamide], showing high affinity for the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor

(pki = 8.9) and a more than 200-fold selectivity over a panel
of related receptors (bromidge et al., 1999; routledge et al.,
2000). this compound has been proposed to act as a
cognitive enhancer (rogers et al., 1999). this is supported
by microdialysis studies showing that this compound
increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex
without affecting noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-ht levels
in the frontal cortex and striatum (dawson et al., 2000). this
compound has also been shown to dose-dependently
increase the threshold for generalized seizures in rats, and
has consequently also been considered to be of interest as an
anticonvulsant (routledge et al., 2000).
in order to clarify the potential role of a  xxxg1119xxx  receptor
antagonist for the treatment of schizophrenia, we studied the
effect of sb-271046 in three models related to positive
symptoms of schizophrenia, and which are considered predictive of antipsychotic action. d-amphetamine-induced
hyperactivity (arnt, 1995), and d-amphetamine- (feifel and
reza, 1999; paabøl andersen and pouzet, 2001) or phencyclidine (pcp)- (mansbach and geyer, 1989) antagonised
prepulse inhibition (ppi) in rats. we also tested this compound in a putative model for negative symptoms, pcpdisrupted social interaction (sit) in rats (corbett et al., 1995;
sams-dodd, 1995, 1996, 1998). side-effects potential was
evaluated by testing its ability to inhibit spontaneous motility, and to induce catalepsy in rats (arnt, 1982).
the effect of sb-271046 was compared to clozapine in
all models tested, since clozapine (as with olanzapine) has
one of the highest affinities for the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor of all
marketed antipsychotics (roth et al., 1994). the potential
role of a  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist for the treatment of
schizophrenia will be discussed.

2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
rats used in all experimental paradigms (except ppi)
were male wistar rats supplied by møllegor (denmark).
rats used in the ppi studies were supplied by charles river
(germany). animals were approximately 2 months old and
weighed approximately 250 –300 g when used in the ppi
and sit paradigms, but were generally 200 –250 g when
used in the catalepsy, motility, and d-amphetamine hyperactivity paradigms. animals were housed four per cage for
the motility, d-amphetamine hyperactivity, and catalepsy
paradigms, but two per cage for the sit and ppi paradigms.
they were housed in climate-controlled animal facilities
(temperature at 21 ± 2 °c and relative humidity at
60 ± 10%). animals were housed and studied under a
normal light– dark cycle (lights on: 06:00 – 18:00 h) with
free access to food and water, except for the pcp-disrupted
sit model, in which animals were under a reversed light–
dark cycle (lights on: 18:00 – 06:00 h). animals were
randomly divided into treatment and drug groups. all

procedures were in strict accordance with the danish
committee on care and use of laboratory animals.
2.2. material and experimental design
2.2.1. d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and motility
the test cages were macrolon type iii, high model
(42.5  26.5  18.5 cm) equipped with four infrared light
sources and photocells 4 cm above the bottom of the cages.
the d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity experiments
were run in normal light conditions in an undisturbed room.
the test substances were injected subcutaneously (sc) 30 min
before injection (sc) of d-amphetamine sulphate (0.5 mg/
kg). immediately after injection of d-amphetamine, the rats
were placed individually in test cages and locomotor activity was measured in 15 min intervals for 2 h. the motility
experiments were performed in identical cages, but located
in a dark room in order to obtain a better spontaneous
activity, and consequently optimal conditions to highlight
possible motor inhibition after administration of test substances. the test substances were injected subcutaneously
30 min before measuring motility for 15 min, which means
during the exploratory phase of rats.
2.2.2. ppi
the apparatus consisted of four startle chambers (mops
2b; metod och produkt, göteborg, sweden). each rat was
placed in a wire-mesh cage (18.5  7  6.5 cm) that was
suspended at one point to a piston within a stabilimeter in
such a way that this cage could move freely under the piston.
each cage was enclosed within an individual sound-insulated
box (52  42  38 cm). each movement of the piston was
converted to an analogue signal by an accelerometer. signals
were transferred to a computer using an analog-to-digital
converter from national instruments. custom-designed starwin software package from ellegaard systems (denmark)
ran the startle-stimuli schedules and the real-time data analysis. acoustic noise bursts were presented via two speakers
mounted 15 cm behind the cages. a background noise (62 or
70 db) was maintained throughout the session. startle
amplitude was defined as the maximal of one hundred
1-ms stabilimeter readings collected from stimulus onset.
the four cages were calibrated for equal sensitivity before
starting experimental sessions. stimulus consisted of a burst
of white noise superimposed to the background noise with a
rise time of less than 1 ms.
the pcp-disrupted ppi procedure was designed as follows. after a 10 min acclimatization with the background
sound on, eight startle pulses of 105 db broad band burst for
30 ms were presented to test for basal startle responsiveness.
then eight blocks of six different trial types were presented
to measure ppi. trials were presented pseudorandomly
throughout the session, i.e., pulse alone (105 db), prepulse
alone (77 db), prepulse followed by pulse (three trial types:
67 + 105 db; 72 + 105 db; 77 + 105 db) or no pulse. the
three different prepulses had an intensity of either 5, 10, or

b. pouzet et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 71 (2002) 635–643

637

15 db above the background sound (62 db) and a duration of
20 ms. the time interval between the prepulse offset and the
pulse onset was 60 ms. the intertrial period was constant and
lasted 15 s. the percentage ppi induced by each prepulse
intensity was calculated as: [100  (100  startle amplitude
on prepulse trial)/(startle amplitude on pulse alone trial)].
pcp (2 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected subcutaneously
10 min before starting acclimatization. compounds to be
tested were injected 15 min before pcp administration.
the d-amphetamine-disrupted ppi design differed for
some parameters. after a 5 min acclimatization period with
the background sound on, eight startle pulses of 120 db broad
band burst for 40 ms were presented to test for basal startle
responsiveness. the three different prepulses had an intensity
of either 4, 8, or 12 db above the background sound (70 db)
and a duration of 30 ms. the time interval between the
prepulse offset and the pulse onset was 100 ms. the intertrial
period was constant and lasted 15 s. d-amphetamine (2 mg/
kg) or vehicle was injected subcutaneously 25 min before
starting acclimatization. compounds to be tested were
injected 15 min before d-amphetamine administration.

or head movements, were also not considered cataleptic.
observation for catalepsy occurred once each hour during
the first 6 h, and once 24 h after dosing.

2.2.3. sit
the test was performed in an open arena (150  100 
40 cm). the behaviour of rats was recorded by a video
camera placed above the arena and connected to an s-vhs
video recorder. lighting in the room consisted of dark-red
diffused light. videos were analysed off-line by the ethovision programme (noldus, nl) in order to evaluate activity,
active, and passive sit of rats. sit is defined as the duration
during which animals have their centres of gravity less than
20 cm from each other. during each single trial, sit was
subsequently divided into an active and passive component
for each rat based upon whether the rat moved around in the
arena or was inactive (sams-dodd, 1996). the method
applied for this experiment is the same as the 3-day treatment
protocol described in detail elsewhere (sams-dodd, 1997).
to summarise shortly, 2 weeks after arrival in our facilities,
half of the rats within a drug group were dyed with black hair
colour except on the head. rats received a daily injection of
sb-271046 and pcp (2 mg/kg) for three consecutive days,
24 and 48 h before the last injection. subjects were tested on
the last day of injection, 45 min after the last two consecutive injections of sb-271046 and pcp. sit of rats was
measured for 10 min after placing two unfamiliar rats (one
white and one dyed black) in the open arena, on the same
wall side but at opposite corners. both rats received the same
drug treatment.

2.4.1. d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity
hyperactivity was analysed by two-way repeated measures anova consisting of a between-subjects factor of drug
(six levels for sb-271046: veh –veh; veh –amph; 0.60,
4.5, 9.0, and 18 mg/kg amph; seven levels for clozapine:
veh – veh; veh –amph; 0.31, 0.63, 1.3, 2.5, and 10 mg/
kg amph), and a within-subjects factor of time (8 bins of
15 min each). a post hoc analysis via fisher’s plsd was
performed to complete the analysis of activity between
groups, and of within time intervals. several replications
were performed with proper controls for this model and the
motility in order to define a full dose – response effect.
consequently, the population involved in the control groups
is larger than in the drug groups.

2.2.4. catalepsy
catalepsy was assessed on a vertical wire-mesh frame
(50  50 cm). mesh opening was 1  1 cm and mesh
diameter was 2 mm. animals were considered cataleptic
when they remained immobile during a period of 15 s. rats
showing muscle relaxation were not considered cataleptic.
rats that did not move their paws, but showed active body

2.3. drugs
phencyclidine hydrochloride was synthesized at h.
lundbeck and dissolved in 0.1 m  xxxd390xxx  acid
diluted in 0.9% nacl. d- xxxd163xxx  was supplied
by nomeco (copenhagen) and dissolved in 0.9% nacl. sb271046 hydrochloride was synthesised at h. lundbeck and
dissolved in water. clozapine was supplied courtesy of
novartis (basel) and dissolved in 0.1 m hcl diluted in
0.9% nacl. vehicle controls were always 0.9% nacl. all
compounds were injected at volumes of 5 ml/kg. all doses
are expressed in milligrams per kilogram, according to the
amount of free base, except for pcp and d-amphetamine,
which are expressed as their respective salts. all compounds
were administrated via subcutaneous route.
2.4. data analysis

2.4.2. motility
motility was analysed by one-way anova consisting of
a between-subjects factor of drug (five levels for sb-271046:
veh; 1.2, 4.5, 9.0, and 18 mg/kg; five levels for clozapine:
veh; 0.16, 0.63, 1.3, and 2.5 mg/kg). a post hoc analysis
via fisher’s plsd was performed to complete the analysis of
motility between groups.
2.4.3. d-amphetamine- or pcp-disrupted ppi
the startle amplitude was analysed by two-way anova
consisting of a between-subjects factor of treatment (two
levels: veh, and amph or pcp), and a between-subjects
factor of drug (three levels: veh; 2.3, and 9.0 mg/kg for
sb-271046, and veh; 2.5, 5.0, or 10 mg/kg for clozapine).
mean percentage ppi was analysed by three-way repeated
measures anova consisting of a between-subjects factor
of treatment, a between-subjects factor of drug, and a
within-subjects factor of three prepulse intensities. a post
hoc analysis via fisher’s plsd was performed to complete

638

b. pouzet et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 71 (2002) 635–643

the analysis of the startle amplitude and mean percent ppi
between groups.
2.4.4. pcp-disrupted sit
hyperactivity, active, and passive sit were analysed by
two-way anova consisting of a between-subjects factor of
treatment (two levels: veh and pcp) and a between-subjects
factor of drug (three levels: veh; 4.5 and 14 mg/kg for sb271046). a post hoc analysis via fisher’s lsd was performed to complete the analysis of hyperactivity and sit
between groups. clozapine was not tested in this model, since
its effects have already been extensively described via data
generated in our own laboratories (sams-dodd, 1996, 1998).
2.4.5. catalepsy
catalepsy was analysed by two-way repeated measures
anova consisting of a between-subjects factor of drug
(three levels for sb-271046: 4.5, 9.0, and 18 mg/kg; four
levels for clozapine: 2.5, 5.0, 10, and 20 mg/kg), and a
within-subjects factor of time (seven levels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 24 h).
all analyses were based on raw data and were calculated using the sigmastat (2.03) software system [except
ppi data, which were analysed using the statview (5.0)
software system].

3.2.2. clozapine
a significant main effect of drug [ f(4,31) = 6.62,

3.4. pcp-disrupted ppi
3.4.1. sb-271046
there was a significant ppi effect, as reflected in the
main effect of prepulse [ f(2,84) = 125.23, p < .001]. as
shown in fig. 7a, sb-271046 did not antagonise ( p’s >.40)
pcp-disrupted ppi [ f(1,42) = 31.92, p < .001]. as shown in
fig. 7b, startle amplitude was not affected by any of the
factors analysed ( p’s >.10).
3.4.2. clozapine
as shown in fig. 8a, there was a significant ppi effect,
as reflected in the main effect of prepulse [ f(2,76) = 38.37,
p < .001]. clozapine did not antagonise ( p’s >.55) the
disruptive effect of pcp [ f(1,38) = 14.40, p < .001]. as
shown in fig. 8b, startle amplitude was not affected by
any of the factors analysed (all p’s >.20).
3.5. pcp-disrupted sit
3.5.1. sb-271046

[ f(1,42) = 6.91, p < .02]. a post hoc analysis indicated a
significant difference only between vehicle and d-amphetamine groups in those animals receiving no treatment with
sb-271046 ( p < .005). further, sb-271046 (2.3; 9.0 mg/kg)
reversed the disruptive effect of d-amphetamine ( p < .05
and p < .001, respectively). as shown on fig. 5b, startle
amplitude was not affected by any of the factors analysed
(all p’s >.30).
3.3.2. clozapine
as shown in fig. 6a, there was a significant ppi effect,
as reflected in the main effect of prepulse [ f(2,84) = 45.51,
p < .001]. clozapine normalised d-amphetamine-disrupted
ppi, as reflected by the near-significant treatment  drug
interaction [ f(2,42) = 2.88, p =.067]. post hoc analysis
indicated a significant difference only between vehicle
and d-amphetamine groups in those animals receiving no
treatment with clozapine ( p < .001). both doses of clozapine reversed the disruptive effect of d -amphetamine
( p’s < .001). a main effect of treatment [ f(2,42) = 4.95,
p < .04] reflected that d-amphetamine increased the startle
amplitude of rats.

by a post hoc analysis, demonstrated that at 14 mg/kg,
sb-271046 enhanced this disruptive effect of pcp.

this is the first attempt to study the potential antipsychotic activity of a selective  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist.
sb-271046, which appears to be highly selective across a
broad range of receptor targets (bromidge et al., 1999;
routledge et al., 2000), has in this study a significant effect
in only one model known to be predictive of antipsychotic
action: d-amphetamine-disrupted ppi in rats (feifel and
reza, 1999; feifel et al., 1999b; paabøl andersen and
pouzet, 2001). the effect obtained on this model is similar
to the one obtained with clozapine in this study. disruption
of ppi by a dopamine enhancer is reversed by both classical
and second-generation antipsychotics (swerdlow and geyer,
1993; swerdlow et al., 1994; yamada et al., 1999). this
model can consequently be considered as predictive of a
general antipsychotic effect in the clinic (swerdlow and
geyer, 1993). however, in contrast to clozapine, sb-271046
did not reverse d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in
rats — another model considered to be predictive for a
general antipsychotic effect (arnt, 1995, 2000). consequently, the present results indicate some discrepancy
between these two results.
other compounds, such as oxytocin or  xxxd464xxx , have
been shown to antagonise d-amphetamine-disrupted ppi in
rats (see, for review, geyer et al., 2001). these compounds
are without confirmed antipsychotic effect in the clinic, but
show positive effects in other models that have been
investigated in this study such as nmda antagonistdisrupted ppi (feifel and reza, 1999) or d-amphetamineinduced hyperactivity (feifel et al., 1999a). this is not the
case with sb-271046, and it consequently suggests doubtful
antipsychotic-like effect of this compound. the dosedependent response of sb-271046 in the d-amphetamine –
ppi model is also somewhat contradictory to microdialysis
(dawson et al., 2000) and pharmacological (bourson et al.,
1998) studies showing that the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor is not
involved in dopaminergic transmission. however, other

642

microdialysis studies suggest that the  xxxg1119xxx  receptor may
interact with dopaminergic mechanisms in the rat medial
prefrontal cortex as antisense oligonucleotides partially
antagonised the fluoxetine-induced cortical dopamine
release (matsumoto et al., 1999). thus, we cannot exclude
the possibility that in cns structures involved in the ppi
phenomenon, sb-271046 may directly or indirectly regulate
dopaminergic function.
sb-271046 did not antagonise pcp-disrupted ppi. ppi
disruption produced by noncompetitive nmda antagonists
(mansbach and geyer, 1989) is of interest since this is
suggested to be specifically reversed by second-generation
antipsychotics (bakshi and geyer, 1995; bakshi et al., 1994;
yamada et al., 1999). on the other hand, controversial
effects in this model have also been claimed for clozapine
or risperidone (johansson et al., 1994; swerdlow et al.,
1996). in support of the studies conducted by johansson et
al. (1994), we could not observe any effect of clozapine in
this model. our results suggest that the effect of clozapine in
this rat model is weak (johansson et al., 1994) and variable
between laboratories (geyer et al., 2001). according to the
observed efficacy of risperidone in this model (pouzet et al.,
2002), we believe that we can exclude the possibility that a
problem occurred with the set-up of our equipment. the
reversal effect of sb-271046 on d-amphetamine-disrupted
ppi suggested that this compound could have an antipsychotic-like effect, but this compound showed a lack of effect
in pcp-disrupted ppi. moreover, this lack of effect versus
pcp is consistent with the lack of effect obtained with
sb-271046 in the d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity
model. thus, according to results obtained in these three
models, the probability that sb-271046 can, on its own,
treat positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients seems, as
previously suggested, weak.
with respect to the proposed model of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, i.e., pcp-disrupted sit in rats
(sams-dodd, 1995, 1997, 1998), sb-271046 did not show
any beneficial effect. moreover, when given at the highest
dose, it enhanced the disruptive effect of pcp on active sit.
given at the lower dose, sb-271046 reduced spontaneous
sit of rats, a finding apparently similar to that reported for
oligonucleotide antisense studies of sit in rats (hamon
et al., 1999; otano et al., 1999).
with regard to side effects, similarly to clozapine, sb271046 tested at 18 mg/kg (sc) did not induce catalepsy. as
this model is a predictor of extrapyramidal side effects
(arnt, 1982), it is unlikely that antagonism of the  xxxg1119xxx 
receptor would induce eps. sb-271046 did not reduce the
motility of rats either. this result is at variance with that
obtained using an alternative  xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonist, ro
04-6790. the latter compound has been shown to reduce the
motility of rats when given at high doses (bentley et al.,
1999). however, our results are consistent with those
observed following administration of antisense oligonucleotides in rats (bourson et al., 1995; hamon et al., 1999;
otano et al., 1999). these apparently conflicting results

could be explained on the basis of different experimental
conditions. bentley et al. (1999) tested animals under
normal light conditions, but we tested them in a dark room.
further, we failed to observe the ‘stretching’ effects in
response to sb-271046 that have been reported for both
ro 04-6790 (bentley et al., 1999; sleight et al., 1998) and
antisense nucleotide treatment (bourson et al., 1995).
the current study has demonstrated that an antipsychotic
action of sb-271046 is unlikely. this is consistent with a
previous study showing that sb-271046, in contrast to
clozapine, or haloperidol, did not enhance expression of
c-fos in dopamine nerve terminal regions (branchek and
blackburn, 2000; ireland et al., 1999). according to the
known specificity of this compound (bromidge et al., 1999;
routledge et al., 2000), it does not seem probable that
 xxxg1119xxx  receptor antagonists would have antipsychotic action
on their own. moreover, testing sb-271046 in combination
with the dopaminergic  xxxg656xxx  antagonist  xxxd3096xxx ,
or the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist mdl-100151 in another
model predictive of antipsychotic action pcp-induced
hyperactivity in mice (gleason and shannon, 1997), we
did not observe any enhancement of the beneficial effect of
these two compounds (unpublished data).
