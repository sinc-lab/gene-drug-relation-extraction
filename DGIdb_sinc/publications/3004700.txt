abstract
we recently reported trophic response of transplantante mouse colon
cancer cells (mc-26) to  xxxd2873xxx , in vivo, and demonstrated gastrin
receptors on mc-26 cells, in vitro. in the present study, growth of mc26 cells in mice, in response to  xxxd2873xxx , was studied in relation to
binding kinetics and capacity of  xxxg353xxx .  xxxg353xxx  levels
on mouse fundic and colonie membranes and on mc-26 cellular mem
branes were determined before mc-26 cell inoculation and designated as
day 0 levels. four groups of mice were next inoculated with mc-26 cells
and given injections of either  xxxd2873xxx  (treated) or normal saline
(control) for 10 or 15 days. at the end of the treatment periods, body,
tumor, fundic, and colon weights were noted and  xxxg353xxx  mea
sured. tumor and fundic weights increased significantly within 15 days
of  xxxd2873xxx  treatment, compared to control values. in control (nonpentagastrin treated) mice, the binding affinity of  xxxg353xxx  on
tumor membranes was significantly decreased and associated with the
complete loss of high-affinity  xxxg353xxx  (ad = <0.5 um) by day
is of tumor growth. on the other hand, both the binding affinity and
 xxxg353xxx  levels of tumor membranes were maintained at day 0
values by  xxxd2873xxx  treatment. endogenous gastrin was therefore
ineffective in maintaining high-affinity  xxxg353xxx  on control tumors.
a significant number of low-affinity gastrin-binding sites (aã²= >2 um)
appeared in control tumors by day 15, which could reflect rapid dedifferentiation or conformational changes of  xxxg353xxx  in the absence
of high levels of normal regulatory hormones. these studies demonstrate
that the trophic effects of gastrin on mc-26 cells are probably mediated
by its regulation and maintenance of the binding affinity and capacity of
 xxxg353xxx  on the cancer cells, in vivo.

introduction
carcinoma of the large bowel accounts for 14.7% of all
cancers and is one of the most common causes of death in both
men and women (1). one of the hormones that affects growth
of the mucosa! cells lining the gi4 tract is gastrin (2). a
biologically active analogue of gastrin, pc, has been shown to
stimulate dna and protein synthesis in duodenal and gastric
mucosa of rats (3). on the other hand, antrectomy, which
removes the major source of endogenous gastrin, results in
atrophy of the mucosa of the gastric fundus that can be reversed
by exogenous gastrin (4).
an increased incidence of cancers of the small and large
bowel, in response to dimethylhydrazine or azoxymethane, has
been shown in the rat, after small bowel resection, which is
known to result in elevated gastrin levels (5-7). in addition, we
have reported a significant increase in tumor weight and tumor
dna content of a iran splan table mouse colon cancer (mc-26),

mediated by  xxxd2873xxx  (9). these observations suggest that
proliferation of normal colorectal cells is a gastrin-dependent
process, and that growth of some colorectal and stomach cancer
may also be influenced by gastrin. other tumors arising from
hormone-responsive tissues, notably breast cancer, have been
treated successfully by endocrine-related procedures, when the
tumor has been shown to have specific receptors for the hor
mone! s) that stimulates growth of the tissue (10, 11). it may
not be beyond the realm of possibility to consider, in the future,
similar maneuvers to modify the growth of colon cancer.
gastrin is believed to act by way of specific membrane recep
tors in a manner similar to other peptide hormones. gr are
known to be present on the fundic mucosa of rats, dogs, and
rabbits (12-15). we have recently reported the presence of gr
on mc-26 cells in vitro (16, 17). in a preliminary communica
tion, we have reported the presence of gr in a significant
percentage of human cancers arising from the large bowel and
stomach (18). these findings suggest that the observed trophic
effect of gastrin may be mediated by its interaction with the
 xxxg353xxx  on gi cancer cells. in order to test this possi
bility, we have further examined the growth of mc-26 cells, in
vivo, in response to  xxxd2873xxx , in relation to levels of gr.
materials and methods
transplantation of mouse colon cancer cells in mice. a transplantable mouse colon cancer cell line, ct26, was obtained from mason
research laboratory (worcester, ma); from it, a tissue culture cell
line, mc-26, was established in our laboratory. a large number of these
cells were frozen in 10%  xxxd1896xxx  and were later thawed and
grown in tissue culture as needed. single-cell suspensions were inocu
lated into male balb/c mice (20-25 g). cancer cells (1 x 10*) were
injected s.c. in the flank, as this number was found to be sufficient to
produce cancer in all the animals tested so far, 90% of inoculated mice
survived for 21 days (data not presented).
treatment of animals. after the inoculation of the mice with mc-26
cells, mice were given injections i.p. of  xxxd2873xxx  (250 fig/kg body
weight) (treated group) or of saline (control group) 3 times a day. this
dose of pg was previously found to be optimal for stimulation of tumor
growth (9).
collection of tissue. at the end of the treatment period, which ranged
from 7-15 days postinoculation of mc-26 cells, the mice were decapi
tated. gastric fundus, colorectum, and s.c. tumors were quickly removed
from mice; placed in ice-cold 0.9% nacl solution; and washed exten
sively to remove all extraneous contamination. the tumors had welldefined margins and dissected from surrounding normal tissues without
difficulty. all tissues were removed by one individual who did not know
what variants had been given. all other steps were carried out at 4â°c
unless otherwise stated. tissues were then washed in buffer a (10 him
tris, 137 himnacl, 5 mm kc1, 2 himcacl2, 2.5 himmgci2, 0.25 m
sucrose, ph 7.4), containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (fraction v;
sigma), 0.1% soybean  xxxd207xxx  (worthington), and 0.1% bacitracin (sigma) (bsb). each tissue sample was blotted with whatman
no. 1 paper to remove excess buffer and weighed before and after
mucosa! scrapings. mucosa from the normal fundic and colorectal
portion of the alimentary tract was scraped on ice with an ice-cold glass
slide, and the scrapings were collected in storage vials kept on dry ice.
tumor and colon mucosa samples from 2-4 animals were pooled as
one sample, while fundic mucosa from 4-6 animals was pooled as one

sample and processed independently. each sample was given a code
number and processed in a double blind manner, so that the results
could be evaluated objectively. tissue samples thus collected were
stored at â€”70*cin an ultradeep freeze (reveo).

binding to cells. in a few experiments, the binding of gastrin to
membranes from mc-26 cellular membranes in suspension was mea
sured before inoculation of the cells into mice. the cells were plated at
an initial density of 1 x 10* cells/5 ml, in 60-mm tissue culture plates

preparation of membranes. frozen tissues were weighed and pulver
ized with a thermovac autopulverizer cooled in liquid nitrogen. the
resulting powder was homogenized in five volumes of buffer a plus
bsb, using a precooled polvi ron homogen i/or (pg-iost; brinkman
industries, westbury). the homogenate was filtered through a double
layer of cheese cloth, presoaked in ice-cold buffer a, and subjected to
200 x g 10 min centrifugaron to remove any cell debris. for the
preparation of total crude membrane fractions, the 200 x g 10-min
supernatant was subjected to 30,000 x g 45-min centrifugation in a
fixed-angle sm-24 rotor. pellets (30,000 x g, 45 min) were washed
once again with buffer a plus bsb and repelleted at 30,000 x g for 45
min. the pellet thus obtained was resuspended in buffer b [25 ihm4(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid, 2.5 him mgch, 5
mm kc1, 137 himnacl, 0.7 him nahpo4, 10 mm glucose, ph 7.4]
plus bsb, homogenized manually with a glass teflon homogenizer,
and processed for measurement of protein and gasi riti receptors.
gastrin-binding assay. synthetic human gastrin-17-i (bachern,
terranee, ca) was iodinated with iodo ( ion (pierce laboratory, il) as
we have previously described (17). briefly lodo-gen (5.8 nmol) in 10
.ul of chjcb was dried under nitrogen in a reaction tube. potassium
phosphate buffer (50 n\ of 0.5 m, ph 7.4), 5 n\ of 0.1 nhc1, and 1
nmol of gastrin were next added. the reaction tube was lightly tapped
for 6 min on ice, and the reaction was stopped with 100 /tl of 0.05 m
nii4ik'(>,. monoiodinated gastrin was next separated on an aniã³n

in normal growth medium. forty to 48 h after initial plating, at a time
when the maximum number of gastrin receptors were measurable (data
not shown), the cells were washed with hanks'  xxxd2988xxx 

exchange column, and the specific activity was calculated to be approx
imately 1500 dpm/fmol of gastrin. the biological activity of iodinated
gastrin molecules was determined as published (17) and found to be
similar to that of an equimolar concentration of noniodinated gastrin.
binding to membranes. aliquots of membrane suspension in buffer
b plus bsb, containing approximately 200 pg of protein, were used as
substrate in each tube. a multipoint saturation analysis (7-10 point
assay), using increasing concentrations of radiolabeled gastrin (0.010.5 um),with (nonspecific binding) or without (total binding) 1000-fold
excess of radioinert gastrin, was carried out, and the binding was
analyzed by a scatchard plot of the specific binding data (19). the
binding asssay was performed at 30â°cin a water bath for 30 min, which
was found optimal for measuring the maximum number of binding
sites (data not presented). at the end of the incubation, the binding
assay tubes were chilled on ice, and 100 â¿ilof ice-cold buffer b plus
bsb were added. the peptide hormone bound to the substrate was
separated from the excess, unbound hormone by filtration over cellulose
acetate filters (celotate; millipore) using mul tifili rat ion units (1225
sampling manifold; millipore). the membrane filters containing the
substrates were placed in a glass tube and counted in a gamma counter
(beckman model 5550, with 78% efficiency for 125icounting).

containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx , mechanically dislodged, and
transferred to conical centrifuge tubes. the cells were pelleted at 400
x g for 5 min and lysed with hypotonie te buffer 0.01 m tris, 0.005
m edta, ph 7.4, at 4â°cfor 2 h. the lysed cells were centrifuged at
800 x g for 10 min to pellet the intact nuclei, and the supernatant was
recentrifuged at 30,000 x g for 45 min to pellet the cellular membranes.
the membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer b plus bsb, and the
number of specific binding sites was measured in aliquots of it, as given
above.
other analytical procedures. protein and dna were measured by
the method of lowry et al, (20) and burton (21), respectively. statistical
differences in experimental parameters between the groups were ana
lyzed by the students r test, and values of p < 0.05 were used as
significant differences.

results
binding affinity and gr levels on mc-26 cellular mem
branes. before inoculation of the mc-26 cells in mice, the
numbers of specific gastrin binding sites (gr) were measured
on the membranes prepared from mc-26 cells, as given in
"materials and methods." the number of gr was found to be
50.0 â±12 fmol/mg of protein (table 1), which is similar to the
values (65 â±23 fmol/100 ng of dna) we have previously
reported for gr levels measured in monolayer cultures of mc26 cells, 3 days postplat ing (16). the binding affinity of gastrin
for the gastrin binding sites, derived from a scatchard plot of
the binding data (fig. 1), was also similar to values previously
reported (16).
binding affinity and gr levels on fundic and colonie mem
branes of control mice. at the time of mc-26 cell inoculation,
a group of control mice was decapitated, and the number of
gr was measured on the fundic and colonie membranes. the
total number of gr per mg of protein was calculated from a
scatchard plot of the binding data (fig. 1), and the results are
shown in table 1. significantly higher numbers of gr were
present on the normal membranes of both fundus and colon of
mice, the values being 10-15 times those observed on the rat
fundic membranes by us (17) and other workers (12, 13). we
were interested to find that the binding affinity of gastrin for

fig. 1. scatchard plot of specifically bound i2si-shg-17 to crude membranes
prepared from mc-26 cells, fundus, and colon on day 0, before inoculation into
balb/c mice. details are given in "materials and methods." amounts of
membrane protein used per assay point were 78 uv, for the mc-26 tumor cells,
156 mg for the fundus, and 245 â«igfor colon samples.  xxxg353xxx  levels
calculated from the scatchard plots were 32.6, 34.3, and 41.4 fmol/mg of protein
for tumor, fundus, and colon, respectively. each point is the mean of duplicate
observations from a representative experiment.

gr on the mc-26 cells was similar to that on the normal
colonie membranes (fig. 1).
effect of pg treatment on body and tumor weights and gr
levels. after inoculation of mc-26 cells, a viable tumor was
evident in 90% of the mice 10 days postinoculation. at this
point, a second group of control (not treated with pg) and a
group of treated (pg-treated) mice were decapitated. the body
weights of both the control and treated groups of mice, at day
10, were not significantly different from each other or from
that of mice on day 0 of cancer cell inoculation, (table 2).
tumor weights of treated mice, at day 10, although slightly
decreased (approximately 1.3 times) compared to those from
control mice, were not statistically significant.
the number of gr in both the treated and control groups of
animals is shown in table 1. the binding affinity and number
of gr on normal fundic and colonie membranes from the
treated and control groups of mice at day 10 were similar to
that observed at day 0, indicating that high circulating levels
of pg were without significant effect on normal cell gr levels.
on day 10, gr levels on mc-26 tumor cells, on the other
hand, were significantly reduced (approximately 80%) in the
control (non-pg-treated) mice and insignificantly increased in
the treated group, compared to day 0. the binding affinity of
gastrin for gr remained unchanged in the control and treated
tumor cells on day 10, compared to that on day 0. a repre
sentative scatchard plot of the specific gastrin-binding data
from control and treated mice on day 10 is shown in fig. 2.
this indicates that the number of gr on tumor cells, in vivo,
is acutely under gastrin control and requires the presence of

control*

high levels of gastrin to maintain the full complement of gr.
the endogenously produced gastrin is apparently insufficient
to maintain gr levels on the tumor cells in non-pg-treated
mice.
a third group of control and treated mice were sacrificed on
day 15 and were analyzed as described above for day 10 mice.
the body weights, once again, did not change significantly in
either the control or treated groups of mice on day 15 compared
to those of either day 0 or day 10 mice (table 2). the tumor
weights, on the other hand, demonstrated a significant increase
in the control and treated mice on day 15, compared to those
in the corresponding day 10 mice. the tumor weights of day
15-treated mice were, in addition, significantly higher compared
to those of day 15-control mice (table 2), indicating a positive
trophic effect of pg, at the dose given, within 15 days of
treatment.
by day 15, dramatic changes in the number of gr and the
binding affinity were apparent in the tumors of no ntrea tcd mice
(table 1; fig. 3). the binding affinity of gastrin for gr was
significantly decreased (approximately one-tenth) in the control
mice, at day 15, compared to that in all other groups. a
significantly high number of these low-affinity sites were, how
ever, measurable in the tumors of control mice at day 15. this
could indicate a possible degradation or conformã¢tional change
of the type of gastrin-binding sites being coded in the tumor
cells in the absence of pg. in the normal cells in rats, on the
other hand, a change in the binding affinity, on removal of
endogenous gastrin, has not been observed, although the num
ber of binding sites was reduced significantly (22).
in the pg-treated mice in the present study, the number and
affinity of gr were maintained in the tumor cells on day 15 at
levels similar to those observed at day 10 and day 0, indicating
that the rapid growth of the tumor did not alter the gr response
of the tumor cells to pg. the number of gr on the normal
fundic and colonie membranes was slightly increased at day 15
in the treated animals, compared to that at day 10 and day 0,
but the difference was not statistically significant. an absence
of significant effect of high levels of pg for 15 days on the
number of gr on normal cells indicates that either the exoge
nous pg did not reach the gi tract in appreciable amounts, or
the gr response of the normal cells cannot be increased beyond
the physiological level per cell but is decreased in the absence
of gastrin (22). the significant increase in the growth response
of normal tissues at day 15 in the presence of pg (table 2)
indicates that exogenous pg effectively reaches the gi tract but
results only in weight increases and not in gr levels per unit
of protein or unit of tissue weight.

full complement of binding sites. the reason for this new
acquisition of dependency on the trophic hormone, in vivo, is
not understood, since we have shown the maintenance of spe
cific gastrin-binding activity by the mc-26 cells in vitro, even
in the absence of any hormone in the culture medium (16).
similarly, the presence of receptors for gi hormones, such as
 xxxg2417xxx  (23-25), secretin, and  xxxd464xxx 
(26) on pancreatic, fundic, and colonie cancer cell lines in vitro
has been repeatedly shown in the absence of peptide hormones.
the tumor cells may rapidly dedifferentiate, in vivo, in the
absence of the sustaining hormones, which could explain the
present findings of a loss of binding affinity and concomitant
significant loss in the levels of high-affinity gastrin binding sites
within 15 days of growth in vivo.
in the presence of pg, however, the binding affinity and highaffinity gastrin-binding sites were maintained by the tumor cells
in vivo. this would explain the observed trophic response of
the tumors to pg in vivo. administration of pg to mice, 15
days after cancer cell inoculation, was ineffective in initiating
trophic response,5 further corroborating the possibility that loss
of binding affinity and high-affinity sites, within 15 days, in
vivo, makes the tumor independent of hormone action and
nonresponsive to pg. these studies may thus have future
clinical significance in the light of our knowledge in breast
cancer. breast cancers are known to be either hormone depend
ent or hormone independent, and only the former tumors
respond to endocrine manipulation by regression (27, 28).
recently, we have, in fact, observed a significant decrease in
the growth rate of mc-26 tumors in mice in the presence of
proglumide (an antigastrin drug) (29). in addition we have
observed a significant inhibition by proglumide of  xxxd2873xxx 
effects on both the growth and  xxxg353xxx  up-regulation
of mc-26 cells in vivo.f we thus speculate that, in the future,
it may be possible to identify hormone-dependent gi cancers
and, possibly, to treat them by a suitable endocrine regimen. a
word of caution, however, needs to be applied at this point.
these results, so far, are limited to our observations on only
one tumor cell line and may not apply to other gi cancer cell
lines from other animal models or human sources. studies
therefore need to be conducted on other gi cancer cell lines, in
a similar manner, before the precise role of gastrin in growth
control of gi cancers can be established.

fig. 3. scatchard plot of specifically bound 12*i-shg-17 to crude membranes
prepared from mc-26 cells taken from control and pg-treated mice at days 10
and 15 after cancer cell inoculation into mice. the scatchard plot of the specific
gastrin binding data to tumor membranes from pg-treated mice at day 10 is not
shown and was found to be similar to that shown for the day 15 pg-treated
group.the amounts of membrane protein used per assay point were 170 *tg for
day 10 control tumors, 195 pg of protein for day 15 pg-treated tumors, and
270 /ig of protein for day 15 control tumors.  xxxg353xxx  levels calculated
from the scatchard plots were 5.9,46.1, and 51.8 fmol/mg of protein for day 10
control tumors, day 15  xxxd2873xxx -treated tumors, and day 15 control tumors,
respectively. each point is the mean of duplicate observations from a representa
tive experiment.

these, the mc-26 cells, was found to be highly positive for the
presence of specific gastrin binding sites, with a high binding
affinity for gasfin [ka = 0.5 nm (16)]. in the present study, we
have further demonstrated that the specific gastrin-binding
capacity of the mc-26 cancer cells is maintained 10 days
postinoculation into mice, although at significantly reduced
levels. the gastrin-binding system of the cancer cells appears
to undergo a significant change, in vivo, and requires the pres
ence of high circulating levels of pg in order to maintain the
