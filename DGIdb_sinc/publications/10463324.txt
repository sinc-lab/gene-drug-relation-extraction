 xxxd3562xxx -induced growth hormone release in humans:
mediation by  xxxg1110xxx  receptors?

received: 16 december 1998 / final version: 11 march 1999

abstract rationale: effective neuroendocrine probes of
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor function may facilitate investigation of the role of these receptor subtypes in the
pathophysiology of depression and the mode of action of
antidepressant medication. objective: to investigate the
neuroendocrine profile of the 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonist,
 xxxd3562xxx , in healthy volunteers. methods: twelve
subjects entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
cross-over design study of  xxxd3562xxx  (5 mg orally).
blood samples were taken at 15-min intervals for assay
of prolactin and growth hormone. a further six healthy
men were recruited to an equivalent study to examine the
effect of  xxxd2419xxx  (a 5-ht receptor antagonist with
some preference for  xxxg1110xxx  over 5-ht1b receptors) on
the growth hormone response to  xxxd3562xxx . results:
 xxxd3562xxx  significantly increased plasma growth hormone but had no effect on plasma prolactin or oral temperature. the increase in growth hormone produced by
 xxxd3562xxx  was significantly attenuated by  xxxd2419xxx .
conclusions: we suggest that the ability of triptans such
as  xxxd3562xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  to increase
plasma growth hormone is mediated by their common
agonist activity at postsynaptic  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.

introduction
the release of various anterior pituitary hormones is under the control of serotonin (5-ht) neurones and hormonal responses to selective 5-ht ligands provides a
useful means of determining the sensitivity of distinct 5ht receptor subtypes in humans (cowen 1993). a number of drugs (collectively known as “triptans”) recently
introduced for the acute treatment of migraine have a

high affinity for human 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
(johnson et al. 1997).
measurement of the sensitivity of these receptors is of
interest because they may be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression as well as mediation of the effects of antidepressant drug treatment (briley and moret
1998). for example, desensitisation of presynaptic 5ht1b receptors on 5-ht nerve terminals may be involved in the ability of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors to increase 5-ht neurotransmission (moret and
briley 1990). in addition, administration of the selective
 xxxg1109xxx  antagonist sb-224289 increased 5-ht
release in the guinea-pig dentate gyrus, suggesting possible antidepressant activity (roberts et al. 1998).
a number of groups have found that acute administration of sumatriptan increases plasma growth hormone
(gh) in healthy men and women (facchinetti et al. 1994;
franceschini et al. 1994; herdman et al. 1994; boeles et
al. 1997). we also found that sumatriptan can lower plasma prolactin (prl), although this effect is less consistent
(herdman et al. 1994; whale and cowen 1998). recently, it has been noted that  xxxd3135xxx  can increase plasma
gh (sciberras et al. 1997). animal studies suggest that
5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists can cause hypothermia
(hagan et al. 1997), although such an effect has been
documented only rarely in humans (wing et al. 1996).
the purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of the 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonist  xxxd3562xxx 
(martin 1997) on plasma gh and prl and on oral temperature in healthy volunteers.  xxxd3562xxx  is of interest
to study because it has better brain penetration than
sumatriptan (sleight et al. 1990; martin 1997) and its
neuroendocrine effects might therefore be expected to be
elicited more reliably.

materials and methods
subjects and neuroendocrine testing
we studied 12 healthy subjects (six men and six women, mean age
34 years, range 18–46). on the basis of a semi-structured clinical

224
interview they were determined to have no personal history of
psychiatric disorder. they had taken no psychotropic medication
for at least 3 months. two women were taking the contraceptive
pill, and one was taking hormone replacement therapy. they gave
informed consent to the study which was approved by the local
ethics committee.
subjects were tested on two occasions, receiving either  xxxd3562xxx  (5 mg orally) or identical placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, balanced order design. test days were
separated by mean of 11.6 days (range 2–29). female subjects
were tested within the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle.
subjects were studied at midday after a 4-h fast when an indwelling venous cannula was inserted. after a 30-min rest period,  xxxd3562xxx  or placebo was administered and blood samples removed at 15-min intervals for the following 180 min. oral temperature was measured at 30-min intervals with a glass-mercury clinical thermometer which remained in situ for 10 min. subjects remained at rest throughout the test procedure.
in a subsequent study, we tested six male subjects (mean age
36 years, range 26–44) also at midday after a 4-h fast. each subject was studied on two occasions, receiving either  xxxd3562xxx 
5 mg plus  xxxd2419xxx  40 mg, or  xxxd3562xxx  5 mg plus placebo, in
a double-blind, cross-over, balanced order, design. plasma samples were taken as above except that  xxxd3562xxx  levels were measured at 30-min intervals.  xxxd2419xxx  or placebo were given
60 min before  xxxd3562xxx . test days were separated by a mean of
28.5 days (range 14–61). one subject took part in both of the
above investigations.

results
 xxxd3562xxx  was well tolerated and only transient, mild
drowsiness was reported. three subjects were excluded
from the gh analysis because at least one of their baseline gh measurements at time “0” exceeded 10 miu/l.
following  xxxd3562xxx , but not placebo, there was a
large increase in plasma gh (fig. 1). the anova
showed a significant main effect of occasion (f=14.27;
df=1,8; p=0.005) and time (f=5.49; df=4,29; p=0.003)
with a significant occasion by time interaction (f=5.62;
df=3,25; p=0.004). the peak gh response occurred between 60 and 120 min (fig. 1). in contrast,  xxxd3562xxx 
did not alter plasma prl levels relative to placebo (fig.
2). the anova showed no main effect of occasion

biochemical measurements
following blood collection, plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at –20°c. plasma prl and gh were measured using standard immunoradiometric assays (reagents provided by
netria, london, uk). the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of
variation of the prl assays over the range encompassed by the
standard curve were 4.8% and 2.4%. the corresponding values for
gh were 4.1% and 2.6%. following our usual practice we excluded from the analysis subjects with elevated levels (>10 miu/l ) of
gh at time “0”. plasma  xxxd3562xxx  levels were measured by a
high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) procedure
which utilised coulometric end-point detection, and solid phase
extraction (clement et al., in preparation).

statistical analysis
all analyses were carried out using ssps for windows (version
6.1). hormone and temperature responses were analysed using a
two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) with
“occasion” ( xxxd3562xxx  versus placebo) and “time” as the main
within subject factors. the huynh-feldt correction was used
where the assumption of sphericity was violated. adjusted degrees
of freedom are shown in the text. significant occasion by time interactions on the anova (p<0.05) were further assessed using
fisher’s test of least significant difference as a post-hoc test on individual time points. exploratory anovas showed no main or interactive effects of order of administration of  xxxd3562xxx  or placebo on the hormone responses (all p values >0.1). this factor
was therefore omitted from the subsequent analyses.  xxxd3562xxx 
levels were also assessed by anova with “occasion” ( xxxd2419xxx 
versus placebo) and “time” as within subject factors. plasma gh
responses were also measured as peak change from baseline and
area under the curve measured by the trapezoid method. these
two measures were highly correlated (r=0.95; p=0.001) and therefore only the peak gh measures are shown.

discussion

healthy men following administration of  xxxd3562xxx  (5 mg orally) with placebo (open squares) and  xxxd3562xxx  (5 mg orally)
with  xxxd2419xxx  (40 mg) (solid squares). subjects were tested on
two occasions in a double blind, cross-over design. growth
hormone levels are significantly lower after  xxxd2419xxx  (p=0.021
anova)

(f=0.14; df=1,11; p=0.72) but a significant effect of
time (f=9.19; df=3,30; p<0.001). however, there was no
occasion by time interaction (f=0.84; df=3,38; p=0.49).
similarly, there was no significant change in oral temperature following  xxxd3562xxx . this anova showed
no main effect of occasion (f=2.71; df=1,11; p=0.13), or
of time (f=1.47; df=4,41; p=0.23) and no occasion by
time interaction (f=1.39; df=5,51; p=0.25).
 xxxd3562xxx -induced gh responses were lower following  xxxd2419xxx  pretreatment (fig. 3). the anova
showed a main effect of occasion (f=11.07; df=1,5;
p=0.021) and time (f=5.89; df=3,16; p=0.007) but only
a trend to a significant occasion by time interaction
(f=2.61; df=4,18; p=0.074) the peak gh response to
 xxxd3562xxx  was significantly blunted following  xxxd2419xxx  (mean±sem 27.8±8.1 miu/l for  xxxd3562xxx 
alone and 16.1±7.3 miu/l for  xxxd3562xxx  with  xxxd2419xxx ; paired t-test, p=0.015). plasma  xxxd3562xxx 
levels tended to be lower after  xxxd2419xxx  treatment, although not significantly so. the anova of the  xxxd3562xxx  levels showed no main effect of occasion
(f=2.86; df=1,5; p=0.15) but a significant effect of time
(f=8.74; df=3,15; p=0.001). however, there was no occasion by time interaction (f=1.26; df=4,19; p=0.32).
mean±sem peak  xxxd3562xxx  levels following  xxxd2419xxx  were 4.35±1.1 µg/ml compared to 5.64±1.3
µg/ml after placebo; p=0.35). we included peak  xxxd3562xxx  levels as variable covariates in an anova comparing peak gh responses after  xxxd2419xxx  and placebo.
the reduction by  xxxd2419xxx  of  xxxd3562xxx -induced gh
release remained significant (f=7.88; df=1,4; p=0.048).
the regression of  xxxd3562xxx  levels on the gh response
was not significant (f=0.52; df=1,4; p=0.51).

we found that  xxxd3562xxx  increased plasma gh in healthy men and women but had no effect on plasma prolactin or body temperature. the gh response to  xxxd3562xxx  was blocked by  xxxd2419xxx , suggesting that it may be
mediated by  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (pauwels et al. 1996).
the ability of  xxxd3562xxx  to increase plasma gh is
also shared by sumatriptan and  xxxd3135xxx  (herdman et
al. 1994; sciberras et al. 1997). this suggests that the induction of gh release may be a class property of 5ht1b/1d receptor agonists.  xxxd3562xxx  has a better
blood-brain barrier penetration than sumatriptan (sleight
et al. 1990; martin 1997), which raises the possibility
that it may produce more reliable increases in plasma
gh.
comparison of  xxxd3562xxx  and sumatriptan in this
respect is difficult because of the problems of comparing
two drugs with somewhat differing receptor affinities as
well as contrasting pharmacokinetic properties. however, with these reservations we examined the gh response
to sumatriptan in healthy male and female volunteers
from four earlier studies at this laboratory (herdman et
al. 1994; wing et al. 1996; boeles et al. 1997; whale and
cowen 1998) as well as those described in two other investigations where results from healthy subjects were individually tabulated (yatham et al. 1997; cleare et al.
1998).
when all available studies are taken together, 25 of
49 subjects showed a gh response to sumatriptan greater
than 5 miu/l. in contrast, in the present study, 12 of
14 subjects had gh responses to  xxxd3562xxx  above this
threshold (p=0.02, chi-squared test). this provides tentative evidence that  xxxd3562xxx  may induce more reliable
gh release than sumatriptan.
the gh response to  xxxd3562xxx  was significantly
antagonised by pre-treatment with the 5-ht receptor antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx .  xxxd2419xxx  is primarily a  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist which also has alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. however, recent in vitro and in vivo
studies in animals suggest that it is also able to block the
human  xxxg1110xxx  receptor with some preference over the
 xxxg1109xxx  (pauwels et al. 1996). our findings
therefore tentatively suggest that the gh response to  xxxd3562xxx  is mediated by  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.
we cannot exclude the possibility, however, that some
other pharmacological property of  xxxd2419xxx  may be responsible for the attenuation of  xxxd3562xxx -induced gh
release. against this is the fact the  xxxd3562xxx  has no
significant affinity for the  xxxg1113xxx  (martin
1996). in addition,  xxxd2419xxx  did not antagonise the gh
response to insulin hypoglycaemia suggesting that it
does not produce a generalised reduction in stimulated
gh release (prescott et al 1984). another relevant factor
was that plasma levels of  xxxd3562xxx  tended to be lower
in combination with  xxxd2419xxx , although allowing for
this in a covariance analysis did not remove the significant effect on gh responses. however, this possible
pharmacokinetic effect of  xxxd2419xxx  as well as the small

226

number of subjects studied means that our conclusions
concerning the role of  xxxg1110xxx  receptors in zolmitriptaninduced gh release must remain tentative. hopefully future studies will be able to employ more selective
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonists to examine this question.
despite its effective stimulation of gh release we
found no effect of  xxxd3562xxx  on plasma prl. we have
previously found that administration of sumatriptan to
healthy men and women at midday lowers plasma prl
and have tentatively ascribed this effect to activation of
5-ht1b autoreceptors on 5-ht nerve terminals (herdman
et al. 1994; whale and cowen 1998). the fact that  xxxd3562xxx  failed to produce this effect could suggest that
an ability to lower plasma prl is an idiosyncrasy of
sumatriptan rather than a property of 5-ht1b/1d receptor
agonists in general. another possibility, however, is the
differential binding affinity of sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  for 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors. thus while  xxxd3562xxx  has a moderate preference for  xxxg1110xxx  over
5-ht1b receptors, sumatriptan has a more equal binding
affinity for the two receptor subtypes (martin 1997).
this raises the possibility that, at clinically used doses,
 xxxd3562xxx  does not produce sufficient activation of
5-ht1b receptors to lower plasma prl.
there have been few published reports on the effects
of triptans on body temperature, but in animal studies
there is evidence that activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1b
receptors causes hypothermia in guinea-pigs (hagan et
al. 1997). in one study we found a modest lowering of
oral temperature following sumatriptan administration
(wing et al. 1996). however, in the present study we
found no effect of  xxxd3562xxx , perhaps supporting the
proposal that at doses used to treat migraine,  xxxd3562xxx  does not activate 5-ht1b receptors in human brain.
in conclusion, our study supports the ability of
5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists to increase plasma gh in
humans and tentatively suggests that the pharmacological mechanism involves activation of  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors are located both postsynaptically
(bonaventure et al. 1997) and probably in the raphe nucleus where they function as autoreceptors (pineyro et al.
1995). because increases in 5-ht neurotransmission are
associated with increased gh release in humans we suggest that the gh response to  xxxd3562xxx  and other triptans is mediated via activation of postsynaptic  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors probably located in the hypothalamus.
