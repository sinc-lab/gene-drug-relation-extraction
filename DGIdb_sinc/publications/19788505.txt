allograft rejection is mainly driven by the production
of il-2, which expands t cells by linking the  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ) composed of three subunits: cd25,  xxxg1175xxx 
and  xxxg1176xxx .  xxxd1798xxx , widely used in immunosuppression, is a humanized anti-cd25 antibody that disrupts il-2 signaling by binding to cd25 and preventing
the assembly of the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx . here we show
that  xxxd1798xxx , while blocking the t-cell response
to il-2, increases cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell proliferative
response to the homeostatic cytokine  xxxg1183xxx . the il-7r
shares  xxxg1176xxx  with the  xxxg1175xxx  and blocking of cd25 by
 xxxd1798xxx  results in the enhanced formation of the
il-7r that in turn allows  xxxg1183xxx  to bind more efficiently
on the cell surface. the consequently increased il-7r
signaling boosts intracellular phosphorylated  xxxg2216xxx 
and t-cell proliferation. in addition, treatment with  xxxd1798xxx  delays the internalization of  xxxg1184xxx  upon  xxxg1183xxx 
treatment, retaining t-cell sensitivity to  xxxg1183xxx  for a prolonged time. this effect of  xxxd1798xxx  highlights the
redundancy of the cytokine system, which may influence t-cell proliferation in transplanted patients, and
provides information to improve future immunosuppressive strategies.

introduction
host immune response affects the survival of transplanted
allografts. without immunosuppressive agents, host t

cells expand under the influence of growth factors such
as il-2. clinical transplant protocols have now incorporated  xxxd1798xxx , a humanized monoclonal igg1 antibody
that contains the complementary-determining regions of
a murine monoclonal antibody raised against human il-2
receptor ( xxxg1175xxx ) a-chain (1). the  xxxg1175xxx  is composed of three
subunit chains: a- (cd25), b- ( xxxg1175xxx ) and c - ( xxxg1176xxx ).
cd25 binds to  xxxg1175xxx  and thereafter il-2 binds to the
cd25– xxxg1175xxx  heterodimer, after which  xxxg1176xxx  becomes
recruited to the  xxxg1173xxx / xxxg1174xxx  complex (2). signal transduction
is mainly mediated by  xxxg1176xxx  via phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the signal transducer and activator of
transcription 5 ( xxxg2216xxx ), eventually driving t cells into cell
cycle.  xxxd1798xxx  binds to cd25 preventing its association with  xxxg1175xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx  (3,4). although  xxxd1798xxx  is
effective and safe in clinical transplantation, several studies indicate that targeting the il-2– xxxg1175xxx  pathway may not
be sufficient to prevent graft rejection. for example, transplant recipient il-2 knockout mice reject islet allografts (5),
allogeneic splenocytes and vascularized cardiac allografts
(6). these findings suggest a redundancy of signaling pathways involved in t-cell activation and expansion, and raise
the possibility that other cytokines may be involved in allograft rejection.
 xxxg1183xxx  is gaining increasing interest as a  xxxg1173xxx  in immuno-compromised hosts, such as transplanted
patients undergoing immunosuppression. high levels of
circulating  xxxg1183xxx  (7) and  xxxg1183xxx  receptor (il-7r) high t cells (8)
have been implicated in allograft rejection. furthermore,
we have shown that  xxxg1183xxx  expands memory t cells in patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing islet transplantation
under immunosuppressive regimens that include induction
therapy with  xxxd1798xxx  (9). the il-7r is a heterodimer
consisting of an a-chain ( xxxg1184xxx ) and  xxxg1176xxx , both expressed at high levels on resting t cells. thus, it shares
cell surface  xxxg1176xxx  with the  xxxg1175xxx  complex. ligand binding
to receptors sharing  xxxg1176xxx  is thought to be influenced
by competition for available  xxxg1176xxx  (10). we hypothesized,
therefore, that  xxxd1798xxx , by preventing the assembly of
the  xxxg1175xxx  may increase the availability of  xxxg1176xxx  to form the
il-7r with  xxxg1184xxx , which in turn increases responsiveness
to  xxxg1183xxx . to test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of  xxxg1183xxx 
in the presence or absence of  xxxd1798xxx  on human cd4+
and cd8+ t cells.

materials and methods
cell isolation, purification and culture
sodium-heparinized peripheral venous blood samples were provided
through the courtesy of the centro transfusionale at san raffaele scientific institute and the drk blutspendedienst ost gmbh dresden with
informed consent and ethics committee approval. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density centrifugation over  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque
(amersham pharmacia biotech europe gmbh, germany) and washed twice
in phosphate buffered saline (pbs, biowhittaker–cambrex, east rutherford,
nj). cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were subsequently purified to >95% purity by
negative selection with magnetic beads according to manufacturer instructions (miltenyi biotech inc., auburn, ca). purified cd4+ and cd8+ t cells
were plated in 96 round-bottom plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in 200 ll of xvivo 15 (biowhittaker-cambrex) medium, supplemented with 10% human
serum ab (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo), from now on referred as culture
medium. for t-cell activation,  xxxd2676xxx /cd28-coupled beads (invitrogendynal, smestad oslo, norway) were used at 1:20 bead:t cell ratio.

cell staining and facs analysis
cells were stained using the following monoclonal antibodies from bdpharmingen (san diego, ca):  xxxd2676xxx  pe (clone hit-3a), anti-cd4 percp
(clone  xxxg1266xxx ), anti-cd8 percp (clone rpa-t8), anti- xxxg1184xxx  fitc (clone hil-7rm21), anti-cd25 pe (clone 2a3), anti-cd25 fitc (clone m-a251) and anticd132 biotin (clone tugh4). 7-aad (bd-pharmingen) was used to exclude
dead cells. lineage positive cells were acquired from each sample on facscalibur or lsr-ii flow cytometers. data were analyzed with the software
programs winmdi (stanford university, stanford, ca) or flowjo (treestar,
ashland, or).

carboxyl-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl
ester proliferation assay
proliferation was determined using the carboxyl-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (cfse, molecular probes; invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) dilution
assay as previously described (11). cells at 107 /ml in pbs were incubated
at 37◦ c for 10 min with 0.2 lm cfse. staining was terminated by adding
rpmi 1640 containing 5% pooled human ab serum at 4◦ c, followed by one
wash in pbs. stained cells were cultured in a standard 37◦ c co2 incubator
for 5 days. cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were treated with rhil-2 (20 u/ml) or
rhil-7 (10 ng/ml; biosource, bethesda, md) in the presence or absence of
20 lg/ml of  xxxd1798xxx  (roche, indianapolis, in).

 xxxg1183xxx  binding
 xxxg1183xxx  binding was measured using the  xxxg1183xxx  fluorokine kit according to manufacturer instructions (r&d system; minneapolis, mn). resting or activated
t cells were suspended in pbs at 4 × 106 cells/ml with or without  xxxd1798xxx  1 lg/ml and incubated with different concentrations (0, 1, 10,
100, 1000 and 2500 ng/ml) of biotinylated  xxxg1183xxx  for 1 h on ice. avidin-fitc
was added for an additional 30 min. finally, cells were washed in pbs and
analyzed by facs.

intracellular detection of phosphorylated (y694)  xxxg2216xxx 
detection of the phosphorylated form of  xxxg2216xxx  was performed by facs
using the anti-human phospho (y694)  xxxg2216xxx  alexa fluor 647 (clone 47, bdpharmingen) antibody. cells were incubated with  xxxd1798xxx  (20 lg/ml)
in culture medium. subsequently, il-2 (20 u/ml) and  xxxg1183xxx  (10 ng/ml) were
added for 5 min at 37◦ c. for  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation time-course studies,
cells (with or without 20 lg/ml  xxxd1798xxx ) were incubated with 10 ng/ml
 xxxg1183xxx  to induce  xxxg1184xxx  downregulation. at time points 0, 1, 6, 12, 24 and
48 h, additional 100 ng/ml  xxxg1183xxx  was added for 5 min and then cells were
processed as previously described (12). briefly, cells were fixed by adding
16% formaldehyde (sigma) directly into the culture medium to obtain a
final concentration of 1.5% formaldehyde, incubated in fixative for 10 min

2728

at room temperature and pelleted. permeabilization was performed by vigorous vortexing in 500 ll of ice-cold methanol and an additional 10 min
incubation at 4◦ c. cells were then washed in pbs containing 1% bsa
(staining buffer), resuspended at 106 /ml in staining buffer and incubated
with the anti-human phospho (y694)  xxxg2216xxx  alexa fluor 647 for 30 min at
room temperature. cells were washed twice in staining buffer and analyzed
by facs.

association of  xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx 
t cells were suspended in x-vivo 15 without serum and incubated with
or without  xxxd1798xxx  (20 lg/ml) for 15 min at 37◦ c.  xxxg1183xxx  (10 ng/ml) was
added to the cell culture for an additional 10 min. cells were washed twice in
pbs and cell pellets were frozen at −80◦ c, subsequently thawed and lysed
in 50 mm hepes, 150 mm nacl, 15 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm edta, 10% glycerol
and 1% triton x-100. for the detection of association of  xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx 
(figure 5a), cell lysates were incubated with anti- xxxg1184xxx  pe (mouse igg1 ,j,
clone hil-7r-m21, pe) on ice for 20 min. anti-mouse igg1 ,j,-coupled beads
(comp beads, bd-pharmingen) or uncoupled beads as control were added
to the lysates for 20 min on ice to bind the anti- xxxg1184xxx – xxxg1184xxx  complex to
the beads. association of  xxxg1176xxx  with  xxxg1184xxx  was detected after washing
beads in pbs containing bsa and incubation with biotinylated anti- xxxg1176xxx 
(rat igg2 ,j, clone tugh4) for 20 min on ice. beads were then incubated with
streptavidin-apc for 20 min at room temperature, washed and analyzed by
flow cytometry.

confocal microscopy
cd4+ t cells were first activated with  xxxd2676xxx /cd28-coupled beads
(invitrogen-dynal) at a 1:20 bead/t cell ratio for 48 h to increase cell cytoplasm content for improved resolution of intracellular imaging. beads
were removed and t cells were left resting for 5 days until  xxxg1184xxx  expression returned to prestimulation levels as assessed by facs analysis. t
cells were then treated with  xxxd1798xxx  (20 lg/ml) or culture medium
alone and subsequently  xxxg1183xxx  (20 ng/ml) was added. after 3 h of incubation with  xxxg1183xxx , cells were washed in pbs and stained with anti-human
cd4 percp (mouse igg1 ,j, clone  xxxg1266xxx ; bd-pharmingen) for 20 min on ice,
washed in 1% bsa/pbs and stained with alexa fluor 555 goat anti-mouse
igg (invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. 0.5 × 106 washed cd4-stained cells
were allowed to settle onto 12 mm poly-l-lysine coated cover slips (biocoat, bd-pharmingen), subsequently fixed in 3% formaldehyde/pbs and
permeabilized with 0.3% triton x/pbs. after blocking in 0.25% fish skin
gelatin/0.01% saponin/pbs (blocking buffer), cells were incubated for 1 h
with biotinylated anti-human  xxxg1184xxx  (mouse igg1 ,j, clone hil-7r-m21; bdpharmingen), washed in blocking buffer and stained with streptavidin conjugated alexa fluor 488 (invitrogen) for an additional hour. fluorescent dyes
alexa fluor 488 and 555 were detected with a leica sp5 inverse laser
scanning confocal microscope. analysis of  xxxg1184xxx  localization as compared
to cd4 position was performed by random selection of five fields for each
condition, containing approximately 10 cells each.

statistical analysis
to evaluate the effect of  xxxd1798xxx  on the expression of surface markers,
proliferation (cfse dilution) of t cells and  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation, data from
at least three separate donors tested in independent experiments were
compared using a two-tailed paired student’s t -test. a p-value <0.05 was
considered significant.

inhibited proliferation of cd3/cd28 bead activated t cells
(cd4+ : 40 ± 8% cd3/cd28 vs. 5 ± 4% cd3/cd28 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.03; cd8+ : 39 ± 9% cd3/cd28 vs. 6 ± 3%
cd3/cd28 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.03). as expected, the proliferative response to il-2 was inhibited by  xxxd1798xxx . in
2729

monti et al.

resting cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, the addition of 20 u/ml
il-2 induced a low proliferative response that was blocked
by  xxxd1798xxx  (cd4+ : 6 ± 2% il-2 vs. 1 ± 1% il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.01; cd8+ : 13 ± 4% il-2 vs. 1 ± 1%  xxxg1173xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.03). in activated t cells, the addition of  xxxd1798xxx  strongly inhibited il-2–mediated proliferation (cd4+ : 56 ± 10% il-2 vs. 10 ± 4% il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.04; cd8+ : 52 ± 11% il-2 vs. 10 ± 5%
il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.01). in contrast, addition of  xxxg1183xxx 
(10 ng/ml) to resting cd4+ and cd8+ t cells induced proliferation that was consistently enhanced by the addition
of  xxxd1798xxx  (cd4+ : 11 ± 4%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 20 ± 7%  xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.04; cd8+ : 11 ± 5%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 23 ± 6%
 xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.007). in activated t cells, proliferation was not further enhanced by addition of  xxxg1183xxx , but the
combination of  xxxg1183xxx  and  xxxd1798xxx  dramatically increased
proliferation (cd4+ : 43 ± 8%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 85 ± 6%  xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.003; cd8+ : 37 ± 9%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 73 ± 11%
 xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.004). thus,  xxxd1798xxx  inhibits il-2–
mediated t-cell proliferation but enhances  xxxg1183xxx –mediated
proliferation of resting and activated cd4+ and cd8+ t
cells.

 xxxd1798xxx  influences surface expression of cd25 but
not  xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx 
to understand whether the effect of  xxxd1798xxx  on the
t-cell response to  xxxg1183xxx  was due to changes in the surface
levels of the  xxxg1175xxx  or the il-7r, we measured surface expression of cd25,  xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx  in the presence of
 xxxd1798xxx . for the expression of cd25, a noncompeting
antibody clone (m-a251; figure 2a) was used.
as expected, cd25 was down-regulated in the presence
of  xxxd1798xxx  on activated cd4 t cells (mean fluorescence intensity, mfi: 143 ± 36 ctrl vs. 64 ± 23  xxxd1798xxx ,
p = 0.05) and activated cd8 t cells (mfi: 49 ± 11 ctrl vs.
23 ± 4  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.02). in resting t cells, cd25 was
mainly confined to a small subset of cd4+ t cells which
did not express  xxxg1184xxx , consistent with a regulatory t-cell
phenotype (14,15). this population was reduced in the
presence of  xxxd1798xxx  (percentage of cd4+ cd25+
among total cd4+ 2.3% ctrl vs. 0.2%  xxxd1798xxx ,
p = 0.02).
most resting cd4+ and cd8+ t cells express high levels of
 xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx  (figure 2b). the addition of  xxxd1798xxx 
to resting cd4+ t cells did not modify  xxxg1184xxx  (mfi: 52 ± 8
ctrl vs. 54 ± 10  xxxd1798xxx ) and  xxxg1176xxx  (mfi: 28 ± 4 ctrl
vs. 29 ± 6  xxxd1798xxx ) expression.  xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx 
expression on resting cd8+ t cells was also unaffected by
 xxxd1798xxx  ( xxxg1184xxx  mfi: 52 ± 5 ctrl vs. 53 ± 5  xxxd1798xxx ;
cd25 mfi 2.4 ± 0.6 ctrl vs. 2.3 ± 0.4  xxxd1798xxx ;  xxxg1176xxx 
mfi: 25 ± 7 ctrl vs. 25 ± 8  xxxd1798xxx ). on activation, both
cd4+ and cd8+ t cells consistently up-regulated  xxxg1176xxx 
whereas  xxxg1184xxx  was slightly down-regulated. again, the
presence of  xxxd1798xxx  did not affect activated cd4+ and
cd8+ t-cell expression of  xxxg1184xxx  (mfi cd4: 31 ± 5 ctrl
2730

vs. 33 ± 4  xxxd1798xxx ; cd8: mfi: 28 ± 4 ctrl vs. 27 ± 6
 xxxd1798xxx ) and  xxxg1176xxx  (mfi cd4: 31 ± 5 ctrl and 33 ± 6
 xxxd1798xxx ; mfi: 99 ± 13 ctrl vs. 93 ± 13  xxxd1798xxx ).

enhanced binding of  xxxg1183xxx  in the presence
of  xxxd1798xxx 
to assess whether the presence of  xxxd1798xxx  affects
the binding of  xxxg1183xxx  to the cell surface, t cells were incubated with  xxxg1183xxx  fitc in the presence or absence of
 xxxd1798xxx  (figure 3).  xxxg1183xxx  fitc preferentially bound to
cd3-gated  xxxg1184xxx + t cells in a dose-dependent manner
(figure 3a). the addition of  xxxd1798xxx  significantly increased the binding of  xxxg1183xxx -fitc on both resting and activated t cells (figure 3b). analysis of the data as fold increase suggests that, in the presence of  xxxd1798xxx , the
promotion of binding of  xxxg1183xxx  to the t-cell surface is inversely
proportional to the concentration of  xxxg1183xxx .
 xxxd1798xxx  promotes  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation
in the presence of  xxxg1183xxx 
il-7r signaling depends on the interactions of  xxxg1176xxx  with
tyrosine kinases  xxxg1221xxx  and the subsequent phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx . in resting cd4+ and cd8+ t cells,
levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  were low or undetectable and were unaffected by the presence of  xxxd1798xxx  (figure 4). stimulation of resting t cells with il-2 induced high amounts
of p- xxxg2216xxx , and this was markedly reduced in t cells pretreated with  xxxd1798xxx  (cd4+ t cells: 12 ± 4% il-2 vs.
2 ± 1% il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.03; cd8+ t cells: 10 ± 4%
il-2 vs. 0 ± 0% il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.04). similar results
were obtained for activated t cells (cd4+ t cells: 40 ± 9%
il-2 vs. 4 ± 3% il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.008; cd8+ t cells:
32 ± 7% il-2 vs. 4 ± 2% il-2 +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.05). in
contrast to il-2–stimulated t cells, stimulation of resting t
cells with  xxxg1183xxx  induced p- xxxg2216xxx  that was further enhanced
by the presence of  xxxd1798xxx  (cd4+ t cells: 21 ± 6%  xxxg1183xxx 
vs. 45 ± 14%  xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.06; cd8+ t cells:
16 ± 5%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 32 ± 11%  xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.04).
findings were similar in activated t cells (cd4+ t cells:
30 ± 8%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 53 ± 5%  xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx , p = 0.01;
cd8+ t cells: 24 ± 7%  xxxg1183xxx  vs. 49 ± 11%  xxxg1183xxx  +  xxxd1798xxx ,
p = 0.008). thus, the increased t-cell response to  xxxg1183xxx  appears to be a direct consequence of increased binding to
il-7r and signaling through  xxxg1176xxx .
 xxxd1798xxx  favors the association of  xxxg1184xxx 
and  xxxg1176xxx  to form the high-affinity il-7r
we have shown that  xxxd1798xxx  enhances the t-cell response to  xxxg1183xxx  and that this could be due to an increased
availability of  xxxg1176xxx  that associates with  xxxg1184xxx  to form
the high-affinity il-7r. to formally show this association,
we developed a coprecipitation assay to measure receptor association by flow cytometry (figure 5a, b).  xxxd1798xxx  did not significantly enhance the association of
 xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx  in resting t cells (mfi 15.5 ± 1.4
medium vs. 16.1 ± 2.0  xxxd1798xxx ; figure 5c). resting
t cells pretreated with  xxxg1183xxx  showed a reduction of  xxxg1176xxx

and  xxxg1183xxx  restored the presence of the  xxxg1184xxx – xxxg1176xxx  complex (mfi 14.2 ± 3.2, p = 0.08). the association of  xxxg1184xxx

and  xxxg1176xxx  appeared to be reduced in activated t cells
where the expression of  xxxg1184xxx  is partially down-regulated

 xxxd1798xxx  promotes response of t cells to  xxxg1183xxx 

to stabilize the surface expression of  xxxg1184xxx  over the 3-h
incubation period with the majority of  xxxg1184xxx  remaining on
the cell surface (figure 6a, lower panels).
to determine how long  xxxd1798xxx  could stabilize surface
 xxxg1184xxx  expression, a time-course experiment was performed (figure 6b right panels). in both cd4+ and cd8+
t cells, the addition of  xxxg1183xxx  induced rapid downregulation
of  xxxg1184xxx  within 1 h and for at least 48 h. pretreatment
of both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells with  xxxd1798xxx  strongly
delayed  xxxg1184xxx  downregulation. for at least 12 h after  xxxg1183xxx 
treatment, the level of surface  xxxg1184xxx  expression in cells
treated with  xxxg1183xxx  plus  xxxd1798xxx  remained above that observed in cells treated with  xxxg1183xxx  alone.  xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation was measured at the same time points (figure 6b left
panels) and, consistent with the downregulation of  xxxg1184xxx ,
 xxxg2216xxx  phosphorylation in response to  xxxg1183xxx  reached basal
levels significantly later in t cells treated with  xxxd1798xxx .
the expression of  xxxg1176xxx  was affected by neither  xxxg1183xxx  nor
 xxxd1798xxx  (not shown). these data suggest that the increased response of t cells to  xxxg1183xxx  and the increased presence of the high-affinity il-7r on t cells in the presence of
 xxxd1798xxx  are caused by a delay in the downregulation of
 xxxg1184xxx , thereby prolonging t-cell response time to  xxxg1183xxx .

this was partially restored by incubation with  xxxd1798xxx

 xxxd1798xxx  delays  xxxg1183xxx –induced downregulation
of  xxxg1184xxx  and prolongs response time to  xxxg1183xxx 
 xxxd1798xxx  increased the presence of the high-affinity  xxxg1184xxx  on the surface of t cells. as  xxxg1183xxx  is known to induce rapid
downregulation of  xxxg1184xxx , we asked whether the presence
of  xxxd1798xxx  could stabilize surface expression of  xxxg1184xxx .
laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to visualize
internalization of  xxxg1184xxx  (figure 6a). expression of  xxxg1184xxx 
was localized to the cell surface in untreated cells left in
culture for 3 h (figure 6a, top panels). three hours after
activation with 20 ng/ml of  xxxg1183xxx , the vast majority of  xxxg1184xxx 
was internalized (figure 6a, middle panels). addition of
20 ng/ml of  xxxg1183xxx  plus 20 lg/ml of  xxxd1798xxx  appeared

discussion
immunosuppressive protocols in transplantation include
the targeting of the il-2/ xxxg1175xxx  axis that is considered to
be the most important pathway for t-cell proliferation. we
show that targeting this pathway with the nondepleting
humanized monoclonal antibody  xxxd1798xxx  conversely
increases the t-cell responsiveness to the t-cell growth
factor  xxxg1183xxx , whose high-affinity il-7r shares the common
c -chain with the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx . hyper-responsiveness
results from increased and prolonged binding of  xxxg1183xxx  to
the high-affinity  xxxg1184xxx – xxxg1176xxx  complex in the presence
of  xxxd1798xxx . because  xxxg1183xxx –mediated t-cell expansion has
been suggested to be detrimental in a number of transplant
settings (7,9,16) and to hinder immune tolerance induction
(17), the findings are relevant to clinical protocols.
we studied cd4+ t cells and cd8+ t cells separately in
either a resting or an activated state, because both the
 xxxg1175xxx  and the il-7r can be differently expressed in each of
the two states. the effects of  xxxd1798xxx  on cd4+ and
cd8+ t-cell proliferation via the il-2/ xxxg1175xxx  axis were consistent with previous findings which show downregulation of
cd25 on t-cell blasts and inhibition of il-2/t cell receptor
induced proliferation and subsequent phosphorylation of
 xxxg2216xxx , a key mediator of  xxxg1176xxx  signal transduction (18).
the results with respect to  xxxg1183xxx  induced or amplified proliferation are novel and support the hypothesis that binding and response to  xxxg1183xxx  is stochastically dependent on
the availability of both  xxxg1184xxx  and  xxxg1176xxx  (10), and further
suggest that responsiveness to individual cytokines is dependent on  xxxg1176xxx  usage by other cytokines. we were

t cells were treated with both  xxxd1798xxx 
and subsequently  xxxg1183xxx , only  xxxg1183xxx , or left untouched (control). three hours after the
addition of  xxxg1183xxx , cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy for the localization pattern of  xxxg1184xxx  (green) in relation to surface
expressed cd4 (8). images are representative of three independent experiments.
(b) graphs show time-course surface expression of  xxxg1184xxx  (left panels) and  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation (right panels) on cd4+ (upper panels) and cd8+ (lower panels) cells.
t cells were either pretreated with  xxxd1798xxx  (filled circles) or untreated (open
circles) and subsequently stimulated with
 xxxg1183xxx . fluorescence is expressed as mfi on
the y-axis of each plot. statistical significance p < 0.05 (∗ ) and p < 0.01 (∗∗ ) and
standard deviation of four donors tested is
indicated for each dot pair.

able to demonstrate that in the presence of  xxxd1798xxx 
there was increased binding of  xxxg1183xxx  to activated cd4+ and
cd8+ t cells, increased phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx  and increased proliferation. we propose that this results from
a relative abundance of  xxxg1176xxx  which, in the absence of
cd25 blocking by antibody, would normally preferentially
form the cd25/ xxxg1175xxx / xxxg1176xxx  high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx  complex
on t-cell activation. in the presence of  xxxd1798xxx , this
complex does not form and the  xxxg1176xxx  is free to form the
high-affinity il-7r in the presence of  xxxg1183xxx .
an unexpected finding was that  xxxd1798xxx  treatment of
cells not only increased  xxxg1183xxx  binding and high-affinity il-7r
formation, but also affected  xxxg1184xxx  turnover. downregulation of surface  xxxg1184xxx  expression through internalization
was rapid after  xxxg1183xxx  engagement, but was substantially delayed in the presence of  xxxd1798xxx . this was observed
using a facs-based immunoprecipitation method and by
microscopy. the mechanism is unclear, but internalization
2734

appears to be limited to free  xxxg1184xxx , because surface expression of  xxxg1176xxx  was unaffected (figure 2). thus, it is
possible that  xxxg1184xxx  expression is modified by the availability of  xxxg1176xxx . therefore, we propose that the increased
proliferative response to  xxxg1183xxx  in the presence of  xxxd1798xxx 
is in part due to increased availability of both  xxxg1184xxx  and
 xxxg1176xxx .
our findings could be relevant to the clinical application of
 xxxd1798xxx . our in vitro studies used a  xxxd1798xxx  concentration (20 lg/ml) similar to therapeutic levels in patients (13). however, the overall cytokine milieu in vivo is
likely to differ to the in vitro environment and thus, the
presence of other cytokines that use the common c -chain
for signaling may buffer the il-2. we also have not shown
whether the phenomenon is unique to  xxxg1183xxx  or is extended
to il-4, il-9, il-13, il-15 and il-21 that also use the c -chain for
signaling. the importance of  xxxg1176xxx  signaling in leukocytes
is evident in x-linked  xxxg1176xxx

 xxxd1798xxx  promotes response of t cells to  xxxg1183xxx 

(x-scid) in humans, where t cells and nk cells fail to develop. on t cells, il-4, il-15 and il-21 are involved in tcell proliferation, homeostasis and polarization (19). thus,
blocking the  xxxg1175xxx  with  xxxd1798xxx  could potentially lead
to a diverse t-cell response and phenotype in situations
of lymphopenia, infection, allergy or autoimmunity. particularly relevant to our findings and the use of  xxxd1798xxx 
in clinical transplantation, is the role of  xxxg1183xxx –mediated tcell homeostatic proliferation as an alternative pathway for
t-cell expansion during lymphopenia. increased serum
concentration of  xxxg1183xxx  has been observed in patients with reduced t-cell counts in a number of pathological (viral infections such as measles and hiv) and iatrogenic (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunosuppression) conditions. in
clinical transplantation, elevated levels of  xxxg1183xxx  have been
correlated with the severity of graft vs. host disease (7),
for which anti- xxxg1183xxx  therapy has been proposed as a treatment (16). in solid organ transplantation, t cells with high
expression of  xxxg1184xxx  have been shown to infiltrate kidney and liver grafts (8). moreover, we have shown that
in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus undergoing islet
transplantation with  xxxd1798xxx  induction therapy,  xxxg1183xxx  promotes the expansion of autoreactive memory t cells (9).
thus, although  xxxd1798xxx  has been used to treat autoimmunity (20), it could theoretically exacerbate disease. the
cd4+ cd25+ t regulatory (treg) cells constitutively express
cd25, but low levels, if any, of  xxxg1184xxx  (14). according to
our data cd4+ cd25+ treg should not benefit from an increased response to  xxxg1183xxx  in the presence of  xxxd1798xxx .
however, we cannot exclude that  xxxd1798xxx  could render treg more sensitive to other c -chain cytokines such as
il-15, which has been shown to induce tregs (21).
this study demonstrates that  xxxd1798xxx , by preventing
association of the  xxxg1175xxx , can favor proliferation in response
to the homeostatic cytokine  xxxg1183xxx  which triggers an alternative t-cell proliferation pathway. the findings are shown
for  xxxg1183xxx , but could extend to other cytokines that use the
 xxxg1176xxx , and identify a potentially clinical relevant novel
mechanism of cytokine signaling modulation based on a
shift in  xxxg1176xxx  availability.
