abstract
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) including  xxxd3259xxx 
have shown potent chemopreventive and tumor regressive effects against
colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in the united
states. however, the mechanisms by which  xxxd3259xxx  inhibits tumor cell
growth are not completely understood. we previously reported that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (mek/
erk) signaling cascade in colorectal cancer cell lines at doses that induce
apoptosis, and inhibition of mek/erk activity with  xxxd3462xxx  is sufficient to
induce apoptotic cell death. to determine whether inhibition of mek/
erk activity is necessary for  xxxd3259xxx -induced apoptosis of human colon
cancer cells, stable transfectants were created that express an activated
 xxxg1361xxx  gene in ht29 cells. ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones displayed a 10- to
20-fold increase in  xxxg1361xxx  activity compared with control ht29-pcep4
clones. when compared with control ht29-pcep4 clones, ht29mek1(r4f) clones were resistant to both apoptosis and inhibition of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation induced by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. these results
suggest that inhibition of mek/erk signaling is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites.

ratory identified  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition as an apoptotic mechanism of
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites (8, 9).  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation and activity at times and doses consistent with apoptosis, and inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 with the selective  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,
 xxxd3462xxx , is sufficient to induce apoptosis of human colorectal cancer
cells (8). in this article, we extend these initial observations to show
that stable expression of a gene encoding a constitutively active form
of  xxxg1361xxx  blocks both  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition and apoptosis induced by
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites in ht29 cells. these results indicate that inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling is required for  xxxd3259xxx  metaboliteinduced apoptotic cell death in cultured human colon cancer cells
in vitro.

 xxxg1369xxx /2 mediates apoptosis by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites

results
stable expression of  xxxg1361xxx (r4f) constitutively activates
 xxxg1361xxx  activity in ht29 colon cancer cells. stable clones of
ht29 that express  xxxg1361xxx (r4f) were originally identified by western
blotting for expression of hemagluttinin-tagged  xxxg1361xxx (r4f). four
hemagluttinin-expressing clones were identified and additionally
characterized by a  xxxg1361xxx  in vitro kinase assay. the four ht29mek1(r4f) clones (clones-2, -7, -11, and -15) displayed 10- to
20-fold increased  xxxg1361xxx  kinase activity compared with three different
vector control ht29-pcep4 clones (-1, -11, and -12; fig. 1a). similar
results were obtained with an in vitro kinase assay for hemagluttinin
(data not shown), indicating that the increased  xxxg1361xxx  activity in the
ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones was caused by expression of hemagluttinin-tagged  xxxg1361xxx (r4f).
exogenous egf normally activates  xxxg1361xxx /2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in the
parental ht29 cell line (9). treatment of control ht29-pcep4 clones
with 10 ng/ml egf increased  xxxg1361xxx  activity 7- to 22-fold, as
measured by in vitro kinase activity against  xxxg1366xxx  substrate (fig. 1b).
in contrast, egf treatment did not increase the activity of  xxxg1361xxx  in
ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones, indicating that  xxxg1361xxx  was constitutively
activated.
expression of  xxxg1361xxx (r4f) blocks apoptosis by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. control ht29-pcep4 and ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones were
grown to confluency then treated with  xxxd3260xxx  or  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone, and apoptotic cell death was measured 3 days after drug
treatment. both parental ht29 cells (data not shown) and ht29pcep4 vector control cells displayed a dose-dependent increase in
apoptosis after treatment with either  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (fig. 2a) or
 xxxd3260xxx  (fig. 3a). in contrast, ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones
failed to undergo apoptosis at the same concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites. similar results were obtained in duplicate experiments
with each of the four ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones and three individual
ht29-pcep4 control clones, indicating that the resistance of ht29-

expression of  xxxg1361xxx (r4f) blocks inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. we examined cell lysates
from both control ht29-pcep4 and constitutively active ht29mek1(r4f) clones treated with concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites that induced apoptosis in parental ht29 and vector control
ht29-pcep4 clones. apoptotic concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone
(fig. 2b) and  xxxd3260xxx  (fig. 3b) inhibited the phosphorylation,
but not total protein expression, of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in control ht29-pcep
clones. at these same drug concentrations, however, ht29mek1(r4f) clones were resistant to downregulation of phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2. concentrations of  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites that induced
apoptotic cell death also caused cleavage of caspase-3 in ht29-pcep
but not ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones (fig. 2b; fig. 3b), consistent with
results obtained with the morphologic apoptosis assay (fig. 2a;
fig. 3a). similar results were obtained in duplicate experiments with
each of the four ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) and three ht29-pcep4 clones.

induce apoptosis (8, 9). in addition, treatment with the selective
 xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd3462xxx , induced apoptosis at doses that inhibited
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation for 24 to 72 hours, indicating that downregulation of mek/erk signaling is sufficient to induce apoptotic
cell death. furthermore,  xxxd3462xxx  potentiated apoptosis induced by
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites (8). in the current article, these observations are
extended to show that expression of the constitutively active
 xxxg1361xxx (r4f) gene increases  xxxg1361xxx  enzymatic activity in ht29 colon
cancer cells. expression of  xxxg1361xxx (r4f) in these cells blocks the
ability of  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites to both induce apoptosis and inhibit
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 therefore seems both
necessary and sufficient for the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  to induce apoptosis
in ht29 cells.
although we have consistently seen down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by
a variety of nonselective nsaids ( xxxd3260xxx , indomethacin,
and resveratrol) and related compounds in several different colon
cancer cell lines, including ht29, hct116, sw480, and hct15, not
all of the investigators have found down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by all
of the nsaids. elder et al. (11) reported that the selective cox-2
inhibitor ns-398 induced a sustained increase in  xxxg1369xxx /2 activity in
ht29 cells, and induction of  xxxg1369xxx /2 by nsaids has been reported
in colon (12) and pancreatic cancer cell lines (13). the reasons for
these differing results is not clear but could be because of structural

and functional differences between  xxxd3259xxx  and other nsaids, the
doses used, or the exact cell culture conditions and time points. it is
clear, however, that the ability of some nsaids and related compounds to down-regulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 is not unique to colon cancer cells.
for instance, the  xxxd3259xxx  derivative (z)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-(2furanyl)-indene-3-acetic acid inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in
ras-transformed madin-darby canine kidney cells from 4 to 24 hours
after drug treatment (14). similarly, the nsaids indomethacin and
ns-398 have been shown to suppress  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation in a549
human lung cancer cells (15) and inhibit  xxxg1366xxx  activity in rat primary
endothelial cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(16). this article is the first to show that  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition is required
for the apoptotic effects of  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2
may be an important mechanism for the chemopreventive effects of
specific nsaids.  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition represents an attractive target for
treatment and prevention of colorectal cancer and other cancers.
prior reports have indicated a requirement in  xxxd3259xxx -induced
apoptosis for protein kinase g–mediated activation of  xxxg1370xxx  (5), for
down-regulation of ␤-catenin (17), and for the presence of bax (17,
18). the results presented in this article add an unambiguous role for
the necessity of down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 for the apoptotic effects
of both  xxxd3260xxx  and sulfone. the alternative targets for  xxxd3259xxx  are currently being examined in ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) transfectants,
to determine whether these different pathways are related or independent apoptotic mechanisms of  xxxd3259xxx .
although activation of the mek/erk signaling cascade can protect
several cell types from apoptosis by various agents, the downstream
mechanisms are poorly understood. in some cell types, activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 results in transcriptional and posttranslational modulation of
several bcl-2 family proteins, including antiapoptotic (bcl-2 and
 xxxg251xxx ; refs. 19, 20) and proapoptotic (bad and bim; refs. 9, 21, 22).
mek/erk signaling may regulate mitochondrial events that lead to
activation of caspases. if true, the ht29- xxxg1361xxx (r4f) clones may be
generally resistant to apoptosis induced by any agent that requires the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and not specific to apoptosis by
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. although the mechanism by which  xxxg1361xxx  activation protects ht29 cells from cleavage of caspase-3 and apoptosis
by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites is unknown, we are currently investigating the
bcl-2 family of proteins and mitochondrial changes that lead to
caspase-3 activation by the apoptosome.
in conclusion, our results suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites induce
apoptosis of ht29 colon cancer cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2, and this inhibitory effect is both necessary and sufficient for
the apoptotic effect of these drugs on colon cancer cells. because
 xxxg1369xxx /2 is activated in many colon tumors in vivo (23), inhibition of
mek/erk signaling provides an attractive target for colorectal cancer prevention and treatment. this concept is supported by data
indicating that treatment with  xxxd1688xxx , an in vivo  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor, suppressed growth of colon 26 and ht29 xenografts in vivo (24),
and that  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitors can sensitize cancer cells to other anticancer agents in vitro (8, 13). although we have focused on the role
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 for the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx , other biochemical targets have been identified for  xxxd3259xxx  (4 –7, 18).  xxxd3259xxx 
may mediate its chemopreventive effects by multiple mechanisms and
represents a pharmacological tool to identify potential biochemical
targets against cancer cell survival. using combination therapy with
agents that specifically modulate relevant biochemical targets of  xxxd3259xxx , such as combining  xxxg1361xxx /2 and pde2/5 inhibitors, may take
advantage of synergistic growth inhibitory effects against cancer cells
and could reduce toxicity associated with chronic intake of nsaids
like  xxxd3259xxx . use of such targeted therapies would be useful for both
prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.
