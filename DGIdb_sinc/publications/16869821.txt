aims
to determine the cause of a genotype-phenotype discordancy for  xxxd59xxx 
sensitivity.
methods
a patient, highly sensitive to  xxxd59xxx , and previously determined to carry only
a single cyp2c9*3 allele, was genotyped for additional functionally defective alleles
in the cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genes. family members were also analyzed to trace the
pedigree.
results
the  xxxd59xxx -sensitive patient was found to possess, in addition to cyp2c9*3
allele, a cyp2c9*11 allele and the  xxxg2418xxx  aa diplotype which were all traced back
through the parental lines.
conclusions
 xxxd59xxx  sensitivity in this subject is the consequence of inheritance of multiple
functionally defective alleles in both the cyp2c9 and  xxxg2418xxx  genes. the study
provides additional data in support of diminished cyp2c9 activity due to the presence
of the rare *11 allele.

introduction

single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the
cyp2c9 gene, especially the cyp2c9*2 and
cyp2c9*3 variants which are common in european
populations, are linked to coumarin anticoagulant
sensitivity [1, 2]. recently, one of us (hht) reported a
case of  xxxd59xxx  sensitivity in a patient heterozygous at the cyp2c9 *3 locus [3]. this patient reached
stable anticoagulation at an  xxxd59xxx  dose of
<1 mg day−1, and exhibited oral clearances of (s) xxxd59xxx  and (r)- xxxd59xxx  that were 7%

and 53%, respectively, that of a cyp2c9 *1/*1 subject.
moreover, formation clearances for the major (s)-7hydroxy (s)-6-hydroxy and (r)-7-hydroxy  xxxd59xxx  metabolites were barely 10% of a cyp2c9*1
control population. in the absence of any evidence for
interfering comedications, this overt ‘poor metabolizer’
phenotype is much more characteristic of a cyp2c9*3
homozygote than one heterozygous for this variant
allele.
currently, some 25 coding region polymorphisms are
listed for cyp2c9 on the human p450 allele website

(http://www.imm.ki.se/cypalleles; accessed january 3,
2006), at least half of which are associated with diminished activity in vitro. in caucasians, cyp2c9*2 and
cyp2c9*3 occur at allele frequencies of 12% and 7%,
respectively [4], but many of the newer snps have allele
frequencies less than 1%, thereby making it difficult to
conduct in vivo studies that unequivocally establish
the clinical consequences of the mutation. genotypephenotype discordancies, however, provide a fertile
ground for both new snp discovery and functional
evaluation of rare p450 polymorphisms, as exemplified
by recent studies with both the cyp2d6 and cyp2c9
genes [5–7].
recently, genetic variations in the  xxxg2418xxx  gene
have emerged as a dominant factor in oral anticoagulant
response, contributing up to 30% of interindividual variability in dose requirements of warfarin and  xxxd59xxx  [8–10]. therefore, we re-analyzed dna from our
 xxxd59xxx -sensitive subject for additional functionally defective snps in cyp2c9 and also evaluated
his  xxxg2418xxx  genotype to attempt to gain insight into
this genotype-phenotype discordancy.
methods
subjects

the  xxxd59xxx -sensitive patient and his father,
mother and brother were recruited for the study. no
family members other than the index patient underwent
treatment with  xxxd59xxx . written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and institutional
approval was obtained from the human subjects committees at both the university of maastricht and the
university of washington.
genotyping

genomic dna was isolated from peripheral blood of
each subject and the cyp2c9*2, *3, *4, *5 and *11
alleles genotyped by published procedures [2], as well
as the  xxxg2418xxx  snps, g2653c, g3673a, t5808g,
c6009t, c6484t, g6853c and g9041a, that permit
 xxxg2418xxx  haplotype (h1-h9) and clade assignment (a
or b) in europeans [8, 11]. as described previously,
haplotypes h1 and h2 belong to clade a, while haplotypes h7, h8 and h9 are grouped together as clade b
[8].
results

we confirmed the presence of a single cyp2c9*3 allele
in the  xxxd59xxx  sensitive patient as reported previously [3]. moreover, we also identified this subject as
a carrier of the rarer cyp2c9*11 allele (figure 1, black

box). the family study provides evidence that these two
alleles are carried on different chromosomes, and so this
individual’s cyp2c9 status is that of a compound
cyp2c9 *3/*11 heterozygote (see figure 1). additionally, the patient was homozygous for the  xxxg2418xxx  a
clade (figure 1), a diplotype that occurs in ∼15% of
europeans [8].

discussion

the genotype-phenotype discordancy for this  xxxd59xxx -sensitive patient is resolved by the finding of an
additional functionally defective cyp2c9*11 allele,
compounded further by the  xxxg2418xxx  aa diplotype
known to associate with a low dose oral anticoagulant
phenotype. recent studies in multiple populations have
repeatedly established the importance of vkorc1regulatory polymorphisms to oral anticoagulant outcomes [8–10, 12–14]. indeed, we have found that
european-american warfarin patients that are homozygous for the less common  xxxg2418xxx  a clade require on
average a 45% lower dose than the population mean of
5.5 mg day−1 [8].
in contrast, the functional consequences of the
cyp2c9*11 allele are less well established. in vitro
studies with recombinant cyp2c9.11 expressed in e.
coli [15] and insect cells [11] are indicative of a defective enzyme. however, because cyp2c9*11 occurs at
only ∼2.0% allele frequency in subjects of african
descent and ∼0.7% in caucasians [11, 16, 17], and may
even be absent in japanese [17], in vivo studies have
been limited. allabi et al. reported reduced cyp2c9
activity in three *1/*11 beninese subjects towards

short report

phenytoin [18], but not losartan [19]. king et al.
reported a trend toward lower warfarin dose in three
european *1/*11 patients, but this did not reach statistical significance [20]. recently, takahashi & coworkers
[17] concluded that cyp2c9 *2/*3/*11 genotypes were
an independent covariate contributing to interpatient
variability in warfarin dose in caucasian patients. in a
separate study, we found that four *1/*11 europeanamerican warfarin patients required a 33% lower warfarin dose than wild-type subjects, and suggested that
the magnitude of the detrimental effect of the *11 allele
on cyp2c9 activity towards warfarin lay between that
of the well characterized *2 and *3 alleles [11]. the
results of the present investigation are consistent with a
similarly intermediate effect of the cyp2c9*11 allele
on  xxxd59xxx  metabolism.
in conclusion, this family’s genetic profile, for
both pharmacokinetic (cyp2c9) and pharmacodynamic ( xxxg2418xxx ) genes known to modulate patient
response to oral anticoagulants, is unusual on two
counts, both of which confer coumarin anticoagulant
sensitivity. firstly, there is a preponderance of
 xxxg2418xxx  haplotypes representing the a clade, the
minor of the two clades in european americans [8].
secondly, the family carries two, discrete, functionally defective cyp2c9 alleles, one of which
(cyp2c9*11) is a rare allele in europeans [11, 16,
17]. therefore, multiple genetic liabilities in different
susceptibility genes combine to explain the patient’s
 xxxd59xxx  sensitivity. this case study demonstrates the utility of a comprehensive pharmacogenomic approach targeting both  xxxg2418xxx  and
cyp2c9 for understanding sensitivity to coumarin
anticoagulants, and suggests further that cyp2c9*11
should be included in routine test panels for genotyping of oral anticoagulant patients.
