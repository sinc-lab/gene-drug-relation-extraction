abstract. in this study, we compared the effects of type i benzodiazepine receptor–selective
agonists (zolpidem,  xxxd3058xxx ) and type i / ii non-selective agonists (zopiclone, triazolam,
nitrazepam) with either an ultra-short action (zolpidem, zopiclone, triazolam) or long action
( xxxd3058xxx , nitrazepam) on motor coordination (rota-rod test) and muscle relaxation (traction
test) following the recovery from thiopental-induced anesthesia (20 mg / kg) in ddy mice.
zolpidem (3 mg / kg), zopiclone (6 mg / kg), and triazolam (0.3 mg / kg) similarly caused an
approximately 2-fold prolongation of the thiopental-induced anesthesia. nitrazepam (1 mg / kg)
and  xxxd3058xxx  (3 mg / kg) showed a 6- or 10-fold prolongation of the anesthesia, respectively.
zolpidem and zopiclone had no effect on the rota-rod and traction test. moreover, zolpidem did
not affect motor coordination and caused no muscle relaxation following the recovery from the
thiopental-induced anesthesia. however, zopiclone significantly impaired the motor coordination
at the beginning of the recovery. triazolam significantly impaired the motor coordination and
muscle relaxant activity by itself, and these impairments were markedly exacerbated after the
recovery from anesthesia. nitrazepam and  xxxd3058xxx  significantly impaired motor coordination,
and the impairments were exacerbated after the recovery. these results suggest that the profile
of recovery of motor coordination and muscle flaccidity after co-administration of
benzodiazepine-receptor agonists and thiopental is related to the half-life and selectivity for the
benzodiazepine-receptor subtypes.

studies have revealed that the impaired coordination and
balance induced by hypnotics or benzodiazepines are
associated with falls (1, 5). patient falls are an important
issue in risk management for hospitalized patients and
elderly people in nursing homes (6). such accidents may
lead to negative outcomes, such as injuries, prolonged
hospitalization, reduction in patients’ activities of daily
living, and increased medical expenses. previous studies
of benzodiazepine regimens, which may be associated
with a risk of adverse events, have produced conflicting
results. early investigations of benzodiazepines with
different elimination half-lives have suggested that longacting benzodiazepines are more likely to cause adverse
events than short-acting agents (7, 8). however, other
studies have found significantly greater risks of adverse

introduction
a meta-analysis suggested that short-acting hypnotics
may be effective for the short-term treatment of situational insomnia (1). however, despite their therapeutic
effectiveness, many hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepine derivative triazolam, cyclopyrrolone derivative
zopiclone, and imidazopyridine derivative zolpidem,
have some side effects, including impaired coordination
and balance, cognitive impairment, tolerance, and
dependence (2 – 4). in addition, a number of clinical

effects with the use of short-acting agents (1, 9). these
results indicate that falls are a complex phenomenon
with multifactorial causes such as age, health conditions,
and concomitant medications in the clinical settings.
therefore, studies using experimental animals are
important to clarify the pharmacological profile of
benzodiazepine-receptor agonists.
several benzodiazepine-receptor agonists with receptor subtypes or different elimination half-lives have been
developed. molecular biological studies have demonstrated that the gabaa receptor is a pentamer consisting
of subunits from at least five different families, of which
the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits are generally considered
necessary for modulation by benzodiazepine-receptor
agonists (10, 11). zolpidem and  xxxd3058xxx  bind
selectivity to type-i (omega1) benzodiazepine receptors
(gabaa-receptor subtypes  xxxg830xxx  containing subunits)
(12 – 14). type-ii (omega2) benzodiazepine receptors contain
 xxxg830xxx -,  xxxg831xxx -,  xxxg832xxx -, and  xxxg834xxx -subunits; and zopiclone, triazolam,
and nitrazepam are non-selective for types i and ii
benzodiazepine receptors (13, 15). the benzodiazepinereceptor agonists were also classified based on their
pharmacokinetic characteristics: ultra-short–acting (halflife <6 h) such as zolpidem, zopiclone, and triazolam;
short-acting (half-life 6 – 12 h); intermediate-acting
(half-life 12 – 24 h); and long-acting (half-life >24 h)
such as nitrazepam and  xxxd3058xxx  (16, 17).
previous studies have demonstrated the pharmacological actions of hypnotics at the time of sleep induction
and during sleep (18 – 22). for the evaluation of the side
effects of benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, rota-rod
and traction tests have been used as screening methods
for an impairment of motor coordination or muscle
relaxant effects in rodents (21). however, little is known
about their pharmacological actions just after awakening. on the other hand, thiopental is a rapidly acting
barbiturate and a single intravenous injection of thiopental produces only a brief period of hypnosis and
anesthesia (22). therefore, in this study, we applied the
thiopental-induced hypnosis to the evaluation of side
effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists after awakening.
in this study, we examined the effects of zolpidem,
zopiclone, triazolam,  xxxd3058xxx , and nitrazepam on the
impairment of motor coordination using the rota-rod
test and muscle relaxant activity using the traction test
during the recovery phase from thiopental-induced
anesthesia in mice.

20 – 30 g were used in all of the experiments. all of the
animals were housed in groups of five per plastic cage
(18 × 44 × 27 cm) in a room maintained at 22 ± 2°c
under a 12 / 12-h light / dark cycle with lights on at
7:00 am. the experimental protocol was conducted
according to the guidelines of the ethics review
committee for animal experimentation of ehime
university medical school.
drugs
the following drugs were used: zolpidem (astellas
pharmaceutical co., ltd., osaka), zopiclone (sanofiaventis co., ltd., tokyo), nitrazepam and triazolam
(sigma-aldrich, inc., st. louis, mo, usa),  xxxd3058xxx 
(mitsubishi pharma co., ltd., tokyo), and thiopental
sodium ( xxxd3354xxx ®; tanabe seiyaku co., osaka).
zopiclone, triazolam, nitrazepam, and  xxxd3058xxx  were
dissolved in 0.5% polypropylene glycol (ppg), and
zolpidem and thiopental sodium were dissolved in
physiological saline (0.9%  xxxd3213xxx ). the
thiopental sodium was injected intravenously, and the
hypnotics were injected intraperitoneally at a volume of
0.1 ml per 10 g body weight.

materials and methods

loss of righting reflex
the mice were injected with thiopental (20 mg / kg,
i.v.) in order to induce hypnosis, which was defined as a
loss of the righting reflex. in a preliminary study, we
investigated which doses of ultra-short acting hypnotics
with thiopental were required to induce a similar loss of
the righting reflex. zolpidem (3 and 10 mg / kg, i.p.),
zopiclone (3 and 6 mg / kg, i.p.), and triazolam (3 mg / kg,
i.p.) were administered 10 min before the injection of
thiopental, and the long-acting hypnotics, nitrazepam
(0.6 and 1 mg / kg, i.p.) and  xxxd3058xxx  (3 mg / kg, i.p.),
were administered 20 min before the injection of
thiopental. the control mice were administered
thiopental and vehicle containing the hypnotic solution
(saline or 0.5% ppg). loss of the righting reflex was
induced immediately after the injection of thiopental.
thereafter, the mice were placed in a v-shaped support
in the supine position until recovery under a heat lamp to
maintain normal temperature, and the duration of the
loss of the righting reflex was measured. in the rota-rod
and traction tests, the mice were administered zolpidem
(3 mg / kg, i.p.), zopiclone (6 mg / kg, i.p.), triazolam (0.3
mg / kg, i.p.) nitrazepam (1 mg / kg, i.p.), or  xxxd3058xxx 
(3 mg / kg, i.p.); and these tests were performed at 15, 30,
and 60 min after recovery from the loss of the righting
reflex.

traction apparatus (23). the forepaws of the mouse were
placed on the attached bar (2-mm diameter, 30-cm-long,
30-cm above the bench level) and the latency until
falling occurred was monitored for 60 s.
rota-rod test
the rota-rod test (24) has been used to assess motor
coordination and balance alterations in rodents. in this
study, we used a rotating rod (3-cm diameter) apparatus
(ugo basile, comerio, italy). the rota-rod test was
performed under accelerating conditions: each mouse
was placed on the rod rotating from 3 to 30 rpm over
3 min. the time the animal was able to maintain its
balance walking on top of the rod was measured. the
mice were given two trials with a maximum time of
180 s. prior to the start of all experiments, the riding
ability of the animals on the rota-rod was checked.
statistical analyses
the results obtained were expressed as the mean ±
s.e.m. a repeated measures analysis of variance (twoway anova) with drug factor and time factor was
used. whenever the drug factor or the interaction of drug
factor × time factor was significant, post hoc comparisons were performed with the dunnett test. the data
regarding the duration of the loss of the righting reflex
were analyzed using one-way anova followed by the
dunnett test. the significance level was set at p<0.05.
we used the jmp 5j (sas institute, cary, nc, usa)
statistical analysis software package.
results
table 1 shows the duration of the loss of the righting
reflex induced by the combination with thiopental
(20 mg / kg, i.v.) and hypnotics in mice. the ultra-short–
acting hypnotics, zolpidem (3 mg / kg, i.p.), zopiclone
(6 mg / kg, i.p.), and triazolam (0.3 mg / kg, i.p.), produced a slight but not significant prolongation of the
duration of the loss of the righting reflex induced by
thiopental; and the three hypnotics approximately 2-fold
prolonged the duration of the loss of the righting reflex
in a similar degree. however, zolpidem (10 mg/ kg, i.p.)
significantly (p<0.01) prolonged the duration of the loss
of the righting reflex. on the other hand, the long acting
hypnotics, nitrazepam (1 mg / kg, i.p.) and  xxxd3058xxx 
(3 mg / kg, i.p.), approximately 6- or 10-fold significantly prolonged the duration of the loss of the righting
reflex, respectively. however, there was no significant
difference in the duration of the loss of the righting
reflex between the two groups.

discussion
thiopental is an ultra-short–acting depressant of the
central nervous system, which induces hypnosis and
anesthesia. following the intravenous injection of
thiopental, the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes
unconsciousness. at 1 min, the drug attains a peak
concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the
brain. thereafter, the drug is distributed to the rest of the

282

m tanaka et al

body and the concentration is low enough in the brain
such that consciousness returns (22). however, both
drowsiness and staggering tend to still remain for as long
as 15 min after an individual regains consciousness (25).
therefore, in this study, we applied the thiopentalinduced sleep model to evaluate the side effects of
benzodiazepine-receptor agonists after awaking from
sleep. in the present study, the intravenous injection of
thiopental (20 mg / kg) produced a brief period of loss of
the righting reflex for about 2 min, and marked impairments of motor coordination and muscle relaxant
activity were observed just after recovery from the loss
of the righting reflex (data not shown). however, these
impairments completely disappeared 15 min after the
recovery of the righting reflex.
thiopental is a rapidly acting barbiturate (22). barbiturates and benzodiazepines are agonists for the
gabaa-receptor complex, and the combinations of
benzodiazepines with barbiturates exhibit synergistic
interactions (22, 26). on the other hand, the pharmacological relevance of the gabaa-receptor subtypes was
identified by using gene–knock-out mice, and alpha1gabaa receptors were found to mediate sedation,
anterograde amnesia, and seizure protection (27). alpha2gabaa receptors are highly specifically expressed in
the spinal cord, predominately in the superficial layer of
the dorsal horn and in motor neurons (28), with the latter
being most clearly implicated in muscle relaxation. the
in vivo [3h]flumazenil binding assays showed that
zopiclone, triazolam, and nitrazepam interact with high
affinity at both the type i (containing  xxxg830xxx -subunit) and
type ii (containing  xxxg830xxx -,  xxxg831xxx -,  xxxg832xxx -, and  xxxg834xxx -subunits)
benzodiazepine receptors, while the selectivity ratio of
zopiclone for the type i receptors was 2- to 6-fold more
potent than that of triazolam and nitrazepam, respectively (29, 30). in contrast, zolpidem and  xxxd3058xxx 
have been shown to have a high selectivity for type i
benzodiazepine receptors (13, 14). in the present study,
triazolam (0.3 mg / kg, i.p.) and nitrazepam (1 mg / kg,
i.p.) produced a slight but significant impairment of the
muscle relaxant action in the traction test. however,
the single administration of zolpidem (3 mg / kg i.p.),
 xxxd3058xxx  (3 mg / kg i.p.), and zopiclone (6 mg / kg i.p.)
did not produce any muscle relaxant action.
the potentiation of thiopental-induced anesthesia
has been used as a screening method for hypnotic action
in mice (31 – 33). in this study, ultra-short–acting
hypnotics, zolpidem (3 mg / kg), zopiclone (6 mg / kg),
and triazolam (0.3 mg / kg), approximately 2-fold
prolonged the duration of the loss of the righting reflex
induced by thiopental (20 mg / kg, i.v.) in a similar
degree. on the other hand, the long-acting agents,
nitrazepam (1 mg / kg) and  xxxd3058xxx  (3 mg / kg),

approximately 6- or 10-fold prolonged the duration of
the loss of the righting reflex, respectively.
the co-administration of triazolam and thiopental
markedly exacerbated the impairments of both motor
coordination and muscle relaxant activity in comparison
to triazolam alone. the co-administration of zopiclone
significantly impaired motor coordination in the beginning of the recovery from the loss of the righting reflex.
however, there was no significant effect on the muscle
relaxant action, suggesting a faster improvement of the
muscle relaxant action than the impairment of motor
coordination during the recovery from the loss of the
righting reflex. on the other hand, the co-administration
with zolpidem, which has high selectivity for type i
benzodiazepine receptors, did not have any effects on
either the rota-rod or the traction tests. these findings
indicated that zolpidem is short-acting and highly selective for type i benzodiazepine receptors and shows a
faster recovery from impairments of motor coordination
and muscle flaccidity induced by the co-administration
with thiopental.
regarding long-acting hypnotics, the co-administration of thiopental and  xxxd3058xxx  (type i benzodiazepine
receptor–selective agonist) or nitrazepam (type i / ii
non-selective agonist) produced marked impairments of
the motor coordination without muscle relaxant action,
and there is no significant difference in impairments of
motor coordination between nitrazepam and  xxxd3058xxx .
in addition, the impairments of motor coordination by
co-administration of long-acting hypnotics were
markedly more than those by the short-acting hypnotics,
except for triazolam. these results indicated that the
impairment of motor coordination during the recovery
phase from anesthesia might be related to the half-life of
hypnotics. however, further studies will be necessary,
since  xxxd3058xxx  caused a more prolonged duration of
the loss of the righting reflex induced by thiopental in
comparison to nitrazepam, but no significant difference
was observed between the two groups. taken together,
the results of the current study suggest that zolpidem
that is short-acting and highly selective for type i
benzodiazepine receptors shows faster recovery from
impairment of motor coordination induced by the coadministration with thiopental.
in the present study, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists
more markedly impaired motor coordination in the rotarod test than muscle relaxant activity in the traction test
during the recovery from the loss of the righting reflex
induced by thiopental. in this study, we examined the
muscle relaxant effects using the traction test, which
measures the grip strength of the fore paws. however,
there is a need to investigate the muscle relaxant activities of all four limbs using another method such as the

hypnotics and side effects

climbing test or inclined screen test (34). on the other
hand, one of the side effects of benzodiazepine-receptor
agonists is delirium (35) and this is thought to be
associated with falls (36). therefore, it is necessary to
examine the effect of benzodiazepine-receptor agonists
on the level of consciousness in order to achieve a more
detailed understanding of the factors that contribute to
prevent hypnotics-related falls in patients treated with
these drugs.
in summary, the major findings of the present study
were that the impairment of the movement disorder was
markedly exacerbated after the recovery from the loss of
the righting reflex induced by thiopental and that the
profile of recovery from the impairments in both motor
coordination and muscle flaccidity may be related to the
half-life of the hypnotics and their selectivity for type i
benzodiazepine receptors. further studies will be necessary to clarify the pharmacological profile of hypnotics
after awakening using another hypnotic model.
