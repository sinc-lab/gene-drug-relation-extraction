abstract
previous studies have demonstrated that the −141c ins/del and taqi a polymorphisms in the  xxxg656xxx  gene affect the density of the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx . the present study examines the correlation between these two polymorphisms and the therapeutic response to chlorpromazine,
a typical antipsychotic drug, in 135 inpatients with schizophrenia. clinical symptoms were evaluated using the brief psychiatry rating scale
(bprs) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with 300–600 mg/day of chlorpromazine.
our results show that genotyping −141c ins/del may help to predict the efficacy of chlorpromazine treatment (p = 0.01) due to the fact
that patients with no del allele showed greater improvement than those with del allele on the overall bprs (p = 0.03), and that, therefore,
the potential for therapy in patients with schizophrenia is related to the −141c ins/del polymorphism in the  xxxg656xxx  gene. however, no such
relationship was found for the taqi a polymorphism.

the variation in individual clinical response to psychotropic
drug treatment remains a critical problem in the management of seriously mentally ill patients. although a minority
of patients may experience complete symptom remission, a
large proportion of patients continues to experience significant psychiatric symptoms [9]. genetic factors are commonly
considered as the main cause of this phenomenon.
the therapeutic effect of typical neuroleptics is preferentially realized by antagonizing the dopamine receptor. in
particular, the clinical potency of the neuroleptic drugs has
been shown to be highly correlated with their ability to bind
the  xxxg656xxx  [17]. study with positron emission tomog∗

raphy (pet) has shown that  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is related to
the effect of antipsychotic therapy [10]. two studies show
 xxxg656xxx  density to be higher in depressive patients compared
with normal control subjects [3,23].
in recent years, there has been increased interest in studying the relationship between the  xxxg656xxx  gene and the etiology and treatment of schizophrenia. a study based on
the the japanese population found an association between
−141 c ins/del, the functional polymorphism of the promoter region in the  xxxg656xxx  gene and schizophrenia [1] and the
same polymorphism has been reported to have contributed to
schizophrenia in the swedish and portuguese populations,
respectively [16,22]. in addition, an in vitro study [7] shows
that the del allele of the −141c ins/del polymorphism is directly related to  xxxg656xxx  expression. consequently, this polymorphism is related to the medical effect of dopamine antag-

onists in schizophrenia [24] although some contrary results
have also been reported [14,18].
the polymorphism taqi a in the  xxxg656xxx  gene has also
been studied frequently in recent years. a1 allele in taqi a
has been found to contribute to  xxxg656xxx  density in the caudate nuclei [15] and striatum [27]. a significant decrease
in binding potential of the  xxxg656xxx  in subjects with a1
allele compared to those with no a1 allele has also been reported in a vivo study [19]. these studies have led to the
hypothesis that taqi a polymorphism contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia and to the therapeutic response to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenic patients. although many
follow-up studies have been conducted, the results are controversial. golimbet et al. [4] have demonstrated a possible linkage between schizophrenia and the taqi a polymorphism in sibling pairs. two other studies also support the
proposition that taqi a polymorphism may influence the individual response to antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol [21] and nemonapride [26] in schizophrenic patients
although other studies have failed to show this correlation
[25].
as the first antipsychotic drug used for schizophrenia,
chlorpromazine, a member of the phenothiazine group of
neuroleptics, was introduced in 1952 and is still being used
in some developing countries although it may produce relatively high extrapyramidal effects. like other antipsychotics,
chlorpromazine works primarily by blocking d2 receptors
and this action is commonly believed to be responsible for
controlling the symptoms of schizophrenia. it has a relatively
strong binding activity for the  xxxg656xxx  compared with
atypical neuroleptics.
in this study, we examine whether the  xxxg656xxx  gene
contributes to the therapeutic effect of chlorpromazine in
schizophrenia by investigating the potential genetic role of
the −141c ins/del and taqi a polymorphisms in the  xxxg656xxx 
gene.
all patients (mean age of onset 27.3 years, s.d. 9.2, and
42% female) were recruited from the shanghai mental health
center. every subject had two (or more) of the following characteristic symptoms: delusions; hallucinations; disorganized
speech; grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior; negative
symptoms, i.e. affective flattening, alogia, or avolition according to diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder, third edition, revised (dsm-iii-r). most of the subjects are first-episode patients but several of them are not.
however, it was the first time for all the patients to be treated
with chlorpromazine. no medication was given to them for
at least 1 month before this study. chlorpromazine, a typical
neuroleptic, was applied at a variant dose of 300–600 mg/day.
clinical symptoms were evaluated by the brief psychiatric
rating scale (bprs; overall and gorham, 1962), which covers the core part of panss, before and after 8 weeks of treatment. response was prospectively defined as bprs reduction of at least 50% after 8 weeks treatment. the diagnosis for
each patient was made independently by two fully qualified,
psychiatrists. the participating psychiatrists were given no

information on the genotype of the patients. informed consent was obtained from each patient.
two polymorphisms (−141c ins/del and taq i a) were
genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) with mvai and taqi
[5] enzymes, respectively. using vector nti suite 7, mvai
(takara) was chosen to digest the pcr product, yielding fragments of 333 and 233 bp in the presence of c ins/ins genotype and the single uncut 566 bp fragment in the presence of c
del/del genotype. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by a standard phenol extraction procedure. pcr amplification for a total of 25 ␮l reaction volume
containing 10 ng genomic dna, 1 u taq polymerase, 0.3 ␮l
of each primer(20 ␮m), 2.5 ␮l pcr buffer(10×, qiagen),
5 ␮l q-solution(5×, qiagen),and 2.0 ␮l dntps(each 2 mm)
was performed on gene amp 9700 therm cycler (pe applied biosystems, perkin-elmer). the pcr product digested
with restriction enzymes was separated by 2.0% agarose gel
electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide for uv
visualization.
we used the clump program to compare the differences
in genotype frequency of two polymorphisms between the
two groups. the reported p values were two tailed and
the limit of significance was set at 0.05. the calculation
of odds ratio (or) with 95% confidence interval was
conducted online at http://www.hutchon.freeserve.co.uk/
 xxxd2335xxx .htm. we also used an online calculator at http://
www.kursus.kvl.dk/shares/vetgen/ popgen/genetik/applets/
kitest.htm to test deviation from hardy–weinberg equilibrium in both groups.
genotype distributions showed no deviation from
hardy–weinberg equilibrium. the frequencies of ins and del
in our sample were 88.5 and 11.5%, which is the same as those
in the japanese population [24]. the frequencies of a1 and
a2 alleles were 48.5 and 51.5%, respectively. however, the
two previous studies [26,2] showed values of 34, 66, 48 and
52%, respectively. there was no significant difference of the
allele frequency in our sample compared to the japanese data.
no differences were found in age, proportions of gender, age
at onset, and bprs scores before treatment between the drug
responder and non-responder groups.
genotype frequencies of −141c ins/del and taqi a in
each group are shown in table 1. in this study, genotype
of −141c ins/del polymorphism was found to be significantly related to therapeutic effect in schizophrenia patients
(p = 0.01). additionally, the frequency of del was significantly higher in those patients who showed much less improvement in total bprs score compared with those showing
more improvement (p = 0.03). however, for the taqi a polymorphism, by contrast, no significant difference in genotype
was observed between the two groups (p = 0.99).
in total, 30–40% of patients with schizophrenia have to be
regarded as poor responders to antipsychotic treatment [8],
which creates problems in the therapy of schizophrenia. prediction of the therapeutic effect of antipsychotic drugs is the
key issue in selecting treatment for individual schizophrenic

patients, and a number of variables have been investigated
such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and other factors including age, gender, age at onset and duration of illness,
as summarized by suzuki et al. [26]. furthermore, a familial pattern of treatment response has been observed [13,20],
indicating that genetic factors may play a critical role in the
medical treatment of schizophrenia.
in the present study we investigated −141c ins/del and
taqi a in  xxxg656xxx , which have been identified as important candidate polymorphisms in the response to antipsychotic drugs.
our results showed that the patients with no del allele had a
significantly decreased bprs score compared to those with
del allele, but no significant difference in the bprs score
was detected between the patients with a1 allele and without a1 allele, suggesting that del allele in the −141c ins/del
polymorphism may play an important role in the treatment of
schizophrenia but not a1 allele in the taqi a polymorphism.
with regards to the −141c ins/del polymorphism, the
frequency of del allele is higher in non-responders than in
responders. individuals with no del allele had lower d2 striatal density [7]. del allele, therefore leads to higher density of
the  xxxg656xxx , and is thus less likely to be blocked by chlorpromazine. a direct pharmacogenetic study [24] also showed
that patients with no del allele showing anxiety-depression
symptoms experienced greater improvement than those with
del allele. this may be due to non-carriers of del allele having lower d2 density, which allows more efficient blockage
of  xxxg656xxx . studies of the taqi a polymorphism show that a1
allele is related to lower density of the  xxxg656xxx  [15,27,19]
but our study found no association between a1 allele and the
drug response in the therapy of schizophrenia, which is consistent with the reports from two other studies [11,25]. although some studies support the theory that a1 allele affects
density of the  xxxg656xxx  as mentioned above, its binding
potential is not affected by a1 allele [12], which may partly
explain the absence of correlation between a1 allele and drug
response. another study [28] using the diplotype consisting
of the −141c ins/del polymorphism and the taqi a polymorphism in the  xxxg656xxx  gene has shown the ins-a2/del-a1
may predict superior risperidone response in schizophrenic
patients. however, we have not done any diplotype analysis
because there was no linkage disequilibrium between these
two loci, a finding supported by other work [6]. in addition,
we didn’t do further assessment for subgroups of symptoms

due to the relatively small sample size to avoid the possible
decrease of statistical power.
in conclusion, our results show that del allele of the
−141c ins/del polymorphism may predict therapeutic response to chlorpromazine in schizophrenia probably due to
alteration of the  xxxg656xxx  density but that the a1 allele
of the taqi a polymorphism may have no such effect. these
findings show promise for clinical application if correlation
between these polymorphisms of the  xxxg656xxx  gene and drug
response can be confirmed by further study.
