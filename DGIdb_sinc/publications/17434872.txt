dimensional structures, and catalyze the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  (aa) to prostaglandin h2.  xxxd2517xxx  is a highly
selective cox-2 inhibitor that is weakly acidic and displays a
unique pharmacological profile that includes rapid absorbance
and a relatively short plasma half-life (1).  xxxd2517xxx  displays
a 500-fold greater selectivity for cox-2 than cox-1 in vivo (2)
and in clinical studies has shown a 3– 4-fold reduction in ulcer
complications versus classical nsaids (3, 4).  xxxd2517xxx  lacks
the tricyclic structure of the diarylheterocycle class of cox-2selective inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib and rofecoxib) and does not
contain a sulfonamide or sulfone group. instead,  xxxd2517xxx  is
a close structural analog of diclofenac (fig. 1). although  xxxd2517xxx  and diclofenac share structural similarities, they exhibit
large differences in the selectivity of cox-2 inhibition. the
molecular basis for this difference in the selectivity of cox
inhibition is not entirely understood.
previous crystal structures of cox enzymes with carboxylic
acid-containing nsaids reveal that the inhibitors are typically
positioned with their carboxylates coordinated to arg-120 and
their aromatic functional groups projecting up into the
cyclooxygenase active site (5, 6). however, a crystal structure of
diclofenac bound in the active site of cox-2 (fig. 2b) revealed
an inverted binding mode of the molecule with its carboxylic
acid moiety coordinated to ser-530 and tyr-385 (7). structureactivity studies have found that another distinctive binding
mode is exhibited by indomethacin, a nonselective nsaid that
is a time-dependent, functionally irreversible inhibitor of cox
enzymes (8). indomethacin binds in the cyclooxygenase active
site with its carboxylic acid group ion-pairing and hydrogenboding with arg-120 and tyr-355 (fig. 2a). in addition, its
2⬘-methyl group binds in a hydrophobic pocket composed of
ala-527, val-349, ser-530, and leu-531 (6). mutations of val349 in this methyl-binding pocket to alanine or leucine alter the
size of the pocket and lead to an increase or decrease in the
potency of indomethacin, respectively. the 2⬘-des-methyl analog of indomethacin does not inhibit cox-1 and is a very weak,
rapidly reversible inhibitor of cox-2 (8).
recently, the crystal structure of murine cox-2 with  xxxd2517xxx  was solved and revealed that  xxxd2517xxx  binds in an
inverted orientation similar to that of diclofenac (9). the carboxylate of  xxxd2517xxx  forms hydrogen-bonding interactions
with ser-530 and tyr-385 at the top of the active site. from this
crystal structure, it was proposed that the cox-2 selectivity of
 xxxd2517xxx  arises from the insertion of the methyl group on
the phenylacetic acid ring into a small groove provided by the
movement of leu-384 in the cox-2 active site. the movement

 xxxd2517xxx  is the first example of a marketed cox-2 inhibitor
of the arylacetic acid class, and it is reported to be the most selective
coxib in vivo. however, the molecular basis of its cox-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. using standard assays,  xxxd2517xxx  was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine cox-1
and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human cox-2. the
extent of cox-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested
that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. kinetic
studies with  xxxd2517xxx  demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human cox-2 that exhibited
at least two binding steps during inhibition. derivatives of  xxxd2517xxx  were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the
phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower
aniline ring. inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl
group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for cox-2 selectivity. the chemical identity and position of the substituents on the
lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and
extent of cox inhibition as well as cox-2 selectivity. mutation of
ser-530 to ala or val-349 to ala or leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human cox-2 and key  xxxd2517xxx 
analogs. interestingly, a val-349 to ile mutant was inhibited with
equal potency to human cox-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-,
or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of
 xxxd2517xxx , actually showed an increase in potency. taken
together with a recent crystal structure of a  xxxd2517xxx -cox-2
complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of
mutant cox-2s by  xxxd2517xxx  allows the definition of the molecular basis of cox-2 inhibition.

experimental procedures
materials and enzymes—the starting materials, ligands, and
catalysts for all chemical reactions were commercially available
and were purchased from sigma and alfa aesar (ward hill,
ma). the synthesis and purification of both methylated and
des-methyl  xxxd2517xxx  analogs was carried out as described in
the supplemental materials with only minor modifications to
the reaction conditions being necessary for individual compounds. the expression and purification of murine cox-2 and
human cox-2 from insect cells and of ovine cox-1 from ram
seminal vesicles was performed according to published methods (10). site-directed mutagenesis on murine cox-2 to generate v349a, v349i, v349l, and s530a mutants was performed as described by prusakiewicz et al. (8). [1-14c]aa was
purchased from perkinelmer life sciences.
synthesis and structural characterization of  xxxd2517xxx 
analogs—various 5⬘-methylated and des-methyl  xxxd2517xxx 
analogs were synthesized as described in the supplemental
materials (sections a and b) according to supplemental
schemes 1 and 2. following synthesis, the mass of the purified
product was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectra,
and the structure was confirmed by one-dimensional 1h nmr.
the purity of the product was assessed by high performance
liquid chromatography (hplc) using a light scattering detector. the chemical characterization of each  xxxd2517xxx  analog
is summarized in the supplemental materials (section c).

of this leucine residue is restricted in the cox-1 active site due
to the presence of bulky secondary shell residues behind leu384 (ile-525 and phe-503) that prevent the movement of this
residue with inhibitor bound. the corresponding secondary
shell residues are leu-525 in mcox-2 and val-525 in  xxxg1884xxx 
and leu-503 in both m/ xxxg1884xxx  enzymes. the crystal structure
failed to elucidate the precise binding sites of the halogens on
the lower aniline ring of  xxxd2517xxx , although it appears that
either atom could have accessibility to the small hydrophobic
pocket utilized by the 2⬘-methyl group of indomethacin (ala527, val-349, ser-530, and leu-531).
although the selectivity of  xxxd2517xxx  for cox-2 has been
determined in vivo and the crystal structure of lumiracoxibbound mcox-2 has been solved, structure-activity relationship studies (sars) have not been performed, and the chemical
and structural basis for the balance that exists between potency
and cox-2 selectivity remains unknown for this inhibitor.
therefore, we undertook the synthesis and characterization of
a number of  xxxd2517xxx  analogs in an attempt to uncover the
chemical determinants for selective cox-2 inhibition. in addition, the molecular basis for the selectivity of  xxxd2517xxx  was

dissociation of  xxxd2517xxx ; it exhibited rate constants of
0.0098 s⫺1 and 0.020 s⫺1 for  xxxg1884xxx  and mcox-2, respectively (fig. 4). these results corroborate the inhibition plateaus
(15% for mcox-2 and 50% for  xxxg1884xxx ) that were initially
observed with the ic50 screen and indicate a more rapid reversibility for the murine enzyme. diclofenac was tested in the same
assay and showed off-rates from murine and human cox-2 in
the range of 2 ⫻ 10⫺5 s⫺1, suggesting a much more tightly
bound inhibitor.
the kinetics of cox inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx —the
dependence of cox inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx  on time and
inhibitor concentration was determined by adding arachidonic
acid to wild-type cox preparations following preincubation
with inhibitor for various times. the decrease in substrate conversion at different inhibitor concentrations was plotted
against the preincubation times and fit to a single-exponential
decay with a plateau to determine a value for kobs. the dependence of kobs on inhibitor concentration is represented by equation 1, where ki corresponds to the inhibitor concentration that
yields a rate equal to half the limiting rate, and k2 represents the
limiting forward rate constant for inhibition (8). the reverse

and hplc analyses were performed on each of the  xxxd2517xxx 
analogs to confirm both the structure and purity of the compounds. the 1h nmr spectrum of each  xxxd2517xxx  derivative
was compared with previously published spectra where available (12, 13), and each of the analogs was shown by hplc analysis with evaporative light scattering detection to elute as a
single peak. the spectral characterization of each  xxxd2517xxx 
analog is provided in the supplemental materials.
evaluation of cox inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx —the
kinetic basis for  xxxd2517xxx  inhibition was determined. following a 3-min equilibration of purified, hematin-reconstituted m/ xxxg1884xxx  or ocox-1 at 37 °c,  xxxd2517xxx  and
[1-14c]aa were added simultaneously and incubated for 30 s.
no significant inhibition was observed over a wide range of
inhibitor and substrate concentrations, indicating that  xxxd2517xxx  is not a pure competitive inhibitor (supplemental materials, section d, fig. 1).
we next tested  xxxd2517xxx  against purified m/ xxxg1884xxx  and
ocox-1 using a standard time-dependent protocol designed to
determine ic50 values for enzyme inhibition. fig. 3a shows the
inhibition curve for  xxxd2517xxx  (compound 1).  xxxd2517xxx 
did not inhibit ocox-1 to any appreciable extent, consistent
with prior studies (14). unexpectedly, however,  xxxd2517xxx 
proved to be a poor inhibitor of both mcox-2 (⬃15% inhibition) and  xxxg1884xxx  (⬃50% inhibition). prior in vitro and in vivo
experiments with  xxxd2517xxx  have demonstrated that the
inhibitor exhibits slow, time-dependent inhibition of purified
 xxxg1884xxx  with a ki of 60 nm and ic50 values of 130 and 140 nm,
respectively, for the inhibition of cox-2 in cell-based assays
and human whole blood assays (14). in our study, the inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  activity plateaus at ⬃50% inhibition and
displays characteristics of a reversible inhibitor. although
the extent of inhibition of the human isoform is only 50%,
our results do support the fact that  xxxd2517xxx  exhibits
selectivity for  xxxg1884xxx  over cox-1, since no appreciable
inhibition of ocox-1 was observed even with very high concentrations of inhibitor (100 ␮m).
the standard ic50 assay described above uses levels of
 xxxd208xxx  (50 ␮m) that are well above saturation. thus, if
inhibition of m/ xxxg1884xxx  by  xxxd2517xxx  is readily reversible,
 xxxd2517xxx  would not be expected to strongly inhibit the cox
activity at high substrate concentrations. to probe the effect of
substrate concentration on enzyme inhibition, we incubated
 xxxd2517xxx  with different concentrations of murine or human
cox-2 for 3 min at 37 °c prior to the addition of [1-14c]aa
(6 –50 ␮m) for 30 s. fig. 3b shows that  xxxd2517xxx  competes
moderately with substrate at 50 ␮m aa but inhibits  xxxg1884xxx  to
nearly 100% at high inhibitor concentrations and low  xxxd208xxx  concentrations. fig. 3c shows a similar profile for  xxxd2517xxx  and mcox-2.  xxxd2517xxx  is a weaker inhibitor of the
murine enzyme, as demonstrated by the low extent of inhibition at 25 and 50 ␮m aa. in addition,  xxxd2517xxx  was not able
to fully inhibit mcox-2 even at the lowest substrate concentrations and highest inhibitor concentrations.
 xxxd2517xxx , at a concentration of 1 ␮m, was prebound to
purified enzymes for 3 min at 37 °c, followed by the addition of
 xxxd208xxx  at 50 ␮m for increasing times (30 s to 5 min). the
time course for oxidation of  xxxd208xxx  is a reflection of the

table 2 shows the kinetic parameters for the time- and
concentration-dependent inhibition of wild-type cox
enzymes by  xxxd2517xxx . the values for the inhibition of
 xxxg1884xxx  were in good agreement with previously reported values of ki (0.06 ␮m) and k2 (0.005 s⫺1) (14). since different experimental assays were used to determine the kinetic parameters
for cox inhibition, the present values of ki and k2 for  xxxd2517xxx  inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  are slightly higher (0.32 ␮m and
0.087 s⫺1) than the values noted above. as indicated by a plateau at 50% activity remaining in the ic50 curve, the time-dependent inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  by  xxxd2517xxx  resulted in a
measurable k⫺2 (0.0017 s⫺1), which indicated that the second
binding step was reversible. this k⫺2 is close to the off-rate for
 xxxd2517xxx  from  xxxg1884xxx  measured from the time course of
 xxxd208xxx  oxygenation described above (0.0098 s⫺1)
(fig. 4). not surprisingly, the kinetic parameters for the inhibition of murine cox-2 by  xxxd2517xxx  could not be determined
at either room temperature or 37 °c due to poor inhibition of
this enzyme by  xxxd2517xxx  at high  xxxd208xxx  concentrations. this is in agreement with the attempted ic50 determinajune 1, 2007 • volume 282 • number 22

tion for  xxxd2517xxx  inhibition of mcox-2 where a plateau was
reached at 85% remaining activity.
sar requirements for  xxxd2517xxx  potency and cox-2
selectivity—the cox-2 selectivity of  xxxd2517xxx  has been
attributed to the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring of
the inhibitor and its insertion into a small pocket around leu384, which is made accessible by small secondary shell residues
that exist only in cox-2 (9). the role of the halogen substituents on the lower aniline ring and the nature of their interactions with cox-1 or cox-2 has not been investigated. hypothetically, the fluorine or chlorine substituents of  xxxd2517xxx 
may also contribute to cox-2 selectivity and/or to the potency
of inhibition. purified and hematin-reconstituted  xxxg1884xxx ,
mcox-2, and ocox-1 were screened against  xxxd2517xxx  and
the various synthetic analogs (compounds 1–22; table 1) in our
standard time dependence ic50 assay. several compounds were
additionally screened in separate assays to rule out cox inhibition at low  xxxd208xxx  concentrations (data not shown).
fig. 5 shows the inhibition curves for diclofenac (a),  xxxd2517xxx  (b), and three  xxxd2517xxx  analogs (c–e) against purified
cox-1 and cox-2. as expected from previously reported
inhibition studies (7), diclofenac (compound 10) was a potent,
nonselective inhibitor of all three cyclooxygenase isoforms.
replacement of the hydrogen with a methyl group at the 5⬘-position on the phenylacetic acid ring of diclofenac yields compound 2. compound 2 appears to reversibly inhibit cox-1
(50% inhibition) but potently inhibits both mouse and human
cox-2 in a functionally irreversible manner (nearly 90% inhibition) with ic50 values of 63 and 47 nm, respectively (fig. 5d
and table 1). from these data, it appears that the addition of the
methyl group on the phenyl acetic acid ring of compound 2
introduces cox-2 selectivity. in support of this hypothesis, a
des-methyl  xxxd2517xxx  analog (compound 11) exhibits nonselective inhibition of all cox isoforms (fig. 5c) compared with
the selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibition demonstrated by compound 1.
a fluorine-to-chlorine substitution (compound 1 to compound
2) on the lower aniline ring significantly changes the potency of
cox inhibition. compound 1 inhibits  xxxg1884xxx  to only 50%,
whereas inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  by compound 2 results in nearly
90% inhibition (fig. 5, b and d). although diclofenac and compound 11 are both nonselective inhibitors, diclofenac demonstrates potent inhibition against all cox isoforms (⬃90%)
compared with its 6-fluoro counterpart (25– 40%), supporting a
role for the chemical substituents on the lower aniline ring in
the potent inhibition of cox (fig. 5, a and c). an additional
substitution at the para position on the aniline ring (compound 6) abrogates the cox-2 selectivity observed with
compound 2, suggesting that the precise positioning of substituents on the lower ring is required for selective inhibition
of cox-2 (fig. 5e).
replacement of the fluorine atom on  xxxd2517xxx  with
hydrogen to give the monochlorinated compound 3 negates
any of the  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity observed with  xxxd2517xxx  and
yields a compound that is a very poor inhibitor of all three cox
enzymes (table 1). the monofluorinated compound 4 and the
nonhalogenated compound 5 were similarly shown to be very
poor, nonselective cox-1/2 inhibitors in this assay. the desmethyl versions of these mono- or nonhalogenated derivatives

determinants of  xxxg1884xxx  inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx 

(compounds 12–14) showed identical results (table 1), suggesting that a 2,6 substitution on the lower aniline ring is
required for cox inhibition. however, derivatives that contained a 2,6-difluoro or 2-fluoro-6-methyl substitution did not
inhibit any of the cox isoforms (compounds 7, 8, 15, and 16).
interestingly, a 2-chloro-6-methyl (compounds 9 and 17) or
2,6-dimethyl (compound 20) substitution restored potent and
time-dependent cox inhibition. the addition of larger alkyl
groups, such as ethyl (compound 21) and isopropyl (compound
22), to the ortho positions on the lower aniline ring resulted in a
reduction of inhibitor potency (table 1). less potent inhibition
of cox also was observed with derivatives that contained a
trifluoromethyl substitution. combined, these data indicate
that a 2,6-dichloro, 2,6-dimethyl, or 2-chloro-6-methyl substitution is preferred for potent, time-dependent inhibition of
cox. in addition, our sar analysis corroborates the requirement for a methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring to generate cox-2 selectivity when there is an appropriate 2,6 substitution on the lower aniline ring. interestingly, a comparison
between the 2,6-difluoro (compound 7) and 2-fluoro-6-chloro
and (compound 1) substitution suggests a contributory role for

16384 journal of biological chemistry

the chlorine atom in cox-2 selectivity. compound 7 does not
inhibit cox, whereas  xxxd2517xxx  (compound 1) is selective
for  xxxg1884xxx  over ocox-1. this potential role for the chlorine
atom in selectivity is further supported by a comparison
between compounds 8 and 9 (a 2-fluoro-6-methyl substitution
versus a 2-chloro-6-methyl substitution). here again, the
replacement of a fluorine atom with a chlorine results in selective inhibition of cox-2.
inhibition of the s530a mutant by  xxxd2517xxx  analogs—
the crystal structure of diclofenac bound to mcox-2 shows
the inhibitor bound in an inverted orientation in the active site
with its carboxylate hydrogen-bonded to ser-530 and tyr-385
at the top of the active site (7). ser-530 also contributes to binding interactions in the small hydrophobic side pocket utilized
by the 2⬘-methyl group of indomethacin (ala-527, val-349, ser530, and leu-531). based on the assumption that  xxxd2517xxx 
binds in a similar orientation as diclofenac in the cox-2 active
site (9) and that ser-530 is critical for hydrogen bonding interactions between the inhibitor and protein, several  xxxd2517xxx 
analogs were screened in our standard inhibition assay against a
murine s530a mutant. fig. 6 shows a cox inhibition assay for

compounds 2 and 9 (2,6-dichloro- and 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted  xxxd2517xxx  derivatives) against both wild-type
mcox-2 and the s530a mutant. as expected, mutation of ser530 to alanine reduces both the potency and extent of inhibition
observed with the wild-type enzyme and compounds 2 and 9
(from 85% to 20 –30% inhibition). several additional inhibitors
were screened against the s530a mutant (diclofenac,  xxxd2517xxx , and compound 20; data not shown). in each case, the
mutation of ser-530 to ala abrogated the inhibition observed
with wild-type mcox-2. it is clear from these data that these
compounds are interacting with ser-530 and that this interaction is required for cox inhibition.
inhibition of val-349 mutants by  xxxd2517xxx  and analogs—
a small hydrophobic pocket exists in the active site of both
cox-1 and cox-2 that is composed of four residues (ala-527,
val-349, ser-530, and leu-531). the potent, time-dependent
inhibition of cox by indomethacin is attributed to the insertion of the 2⬘-methyl group of the inhibitor into this small side
pocket (8). mutation of val-349 to alanine increases the size of
the pocket and increases the potency of indomethacin 3-fold,
whereas mutation to leucine has the opposite effect on pocket
size and decreases the potency of the inhibitor by 16-fold. a
val-349 to isoleucine mutation resembles wild-type enzyme
(8). the crystal structure of  xxxd2517xxx  bound to mouse
cox-2 indicates that either the fluorine or chlorine substituent
on the lower aniline ring may be making contacts in this same
small hydrophobic pocket (9). to investigate the importance of
interactions of these chemical moieties with the small hydrophobic pocket, various  xxxd2517xxx  analogs were screened against
v349a, v349i, and v349l mutants in our standard cox inhibition assay, and kinetic parameters were determined for the timedependent inhibition of these enzymes by key inhibitors.
fig. 7 shows the results of a concentration-dependent inhibition assay in which the valine mutants were tested against
diclofenac (a),  xxxd2517xxx  (b), and several  xxxd2517xxx  analogs with key substitutions at the 2,6-position on the aniline
ring (c–e). mutation of valine to alanine at position 349
enlarges the size of the side pocket, but, unlike indomethacin
and v349a, a decrease in the potency of diclofenac was
observed against this mutant. a val-349 to leucine mutation
provides steric bulk and decreases the size of the hydrophobic
pocket, which abrogates any inhibition observed with diclofenac and mcox-2. interestingly, mutation of val-349 to isoleu-

cine results in an enzyme that exhibits equal potency with
diclofenac against wild-type cox-2 (table 3). similar results
were observed with compound 2 (fig. 7d), a diclofenac analog
with a methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring. perhaps the
most intriguing result was observed with  xxxd2517xxx  (fig. 7b)
and compound 11 (fig. 7c), a des-methyl  xxxd2517xxx  derivative. although both compounds were poor inhibitors of the
wild-type mcox-2 enzyme (less than 20% inhibition), the
potency of these inhibitors increased dramatically when
screened against the isoleucine mutant (table 3). as with
diclofenac, these compounds did not inhibit v349a or v349l
to a significant extent. from these data, it appears that there are
interactions between the residues in the small hydrophobic
pocket and these particular  xxxd2517xxx  analogs. it is possible
that the ability of the halogens to insert into this pocket may
determine the potency and extent of cox inhibition observed
with these inhibitors.
to understand more clearly the possibility of inhibitor-protein interactions in the side pocket, several additional  xxxd2517xxx  derivatives were screened against the val-349 mutants.
compound 15 (fig. 7e), a 2,6-difluoro-substituted analog, did
not demonstrate an increased potency against the v349i
mutant. this suggests that, at the minimum, a fluorine-chlorine
substitution is required at the 2,6-position on the aniline ring to
observe an increased potency with v349i. likewise, derivatives
of diclofenac and  xxxd2517xxx  that contained only a monosubstituted aniline ring did not inhibit the v349i mutant (table 3).
interestingly, 2-fluoro-6-methyl derivatives (compounds 8 and
16) resembled a monohalogenated or difluoro-substituted
inhibitory profile against the val-349 mutants, whereas
replacement of the fluorine atom with a chlorine atom to yield
compounds 9 and 17 generated 2-chloro-6-methyl derivatives
that demonstrated increased potency against the v349i enzyme
(table 3). the v349i mutant was resistant to inhibition by compound 22, a 2-methyl-6-isopropyl inhibitor, suggesting that the
steric bulk of the isopropyl group was restricting access to the
small hydrophobic side pocket. compound 21, a 2-methyl-6ethyl derivative, was the only inhibitor tested that showed activity against the v349a mutant with an ic50 of 167 nm compared
with wild-type enzyme (174 nm). these data indicated that an
ethyl substitution on the lower aniline ring would fill the
small hydrophobic binding pocket and inhibit v349a in a
manner similar to wild-type mcox-2. in agreement with
this hypothesis, a decrease in potency was observed with
compound 21 and the v349i mutant (891 nm), suggesting a
steric clash between the inhibitor and protein that leads to a
lower affinity interaction.
altogether, this sar analysis of  xxxd2517xxx  analogs with the
val-349 mutants suggests that a chlorine substituent is preferred on the lower aniline ring for potent inhibition of cox-2
and that a combination of f-cl, cl-cl, or cl-ch3 is allowed at
the 2,6-position to maintain potency. in addition, these data
imply that it is the chlorine atom on  xxxd2517xxx  that is making
binding interactions (perhaps through a halogen bond to the
hydroxyl of ser-530) in the small hydrophobic pocket that consists of val-349, ser-530, ala-527, and leu-531 and that this
interaction may be responsible for the potency of inhibition
observed with the various  xxxd2517xxx  analogs against cox,

whereas the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring determines selectivity.
the kinetics of cox inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx  analogs—
the dependence of cox inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx  analogs
on time and inhibitor concentration was determined as
described above for  xxxd2517xxx . supplemental fig. 2 and
fig. 8 show the kinetics of the time-dependent inhibition of
 xxxg1884xxx  and ocox-1 by compound 2. inhibition of the
cox enzymes by compound 2 proceeded rapidly, and plateaus were reached at short time points for the higher inhibitor concentrations. supplemental fig. 2 shows inhibition
time courses out to 30 min preincubation times from which
kobs values were obtained and plotted in secondary graphs to
determine kinetic constants. the time-dependent inhibition
curve for wild-type  xxxg1884xxx  approached 0% remaining
activity, indicating functionally irreversible inhibition of the
enzyme by compound 2. similar results were demonstrated
for wild-type mcox-2 (data not shown). inhibition of
ocox-1 by compound 2 approached a nonzero asymptote of
nearly 20% remaining activity at the highest inhibitor concentrations, indicating that the second step of binding was
moderately reversible. fig. 8 shows the rapid inhibition
kinetics of  xxxg1884xxx  (a) and ocox-1 (c) by compound 2 at

time points less than 2 min. for both wild-type human and
mouse cox-2, the y intercept of the secondary plot of kobs
versus inhibitor concentration was effectively zero (fig. 8b;
data not shown). in contrast, the secondary plot of data for
ocox-1 showed a nonzero y intercept (fig. 8d), which generated a measurable reverse rate constant for the second
binding step (k⫺2 ⫽ 0.0025 s⫺1). in comparison with indomethacin (ki ⫽ 7.9 ␮m and k2 ⫽ 0.052 s⫺1), a slow and
time-dependent nonselective inhibitor of cox (8), compound 2 exhibits an increased binding affinity and similar
forward rate constants for both mouse and human cox-2.
the cox-2 selectivity of compound 2 is most likely related
to the absence of a reverse rate constant for the second binding step in m/ xxxg1884xxx  compared with a measurable k⫺2 for
ocox-1 inhibition.

noted in table 2, mutation of val-349 to isoleucine did not
significantly alter ki and k2 for compound 2. as mentioned
previously, the time-dependent inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  by

discussion
diclofenac is a more potent inhibitor of cox-2 than  xxxd2517xxx , but it is also a much more potent inhibitor of cox-1 (fig.
5). neither compound is a pure competitive inhibitor of
cox-2, but rather both are time-dependent inhibitors that
exhibit a two-step mechanism of inhibition. diclofenac and
 xxxd2517xxx  differ significantly in the tightness of the inhibitorcox-2 complex. diclofenac exhibits a very slow dissociation
rate constant from the enzyme of ⬃2 ⫻ 10⫺5 s⫺1. in contrast,
 xxxd2517xxx  displays a rate constant for dissociation of
0.0017s⫺1. this relatively rapid dissociation is manifest by the
plateau in the ic50 curves at high inhibitor concentrations (figs.

ser-530 was shown to be required
for inhibition by  xxxd2517xxx  and
several key analogs. this is not surprising, since the crystal structures
of diclofenac- and lumiracoxibbound mcox-2 show the inhibitors
making hydrogen bonding interactions with tyr-385 and ser-530 at
the top of the active site (7, 9). ser530 also contributes to a small
hydrophobic binding pocket that is
composed of val-349, ala-527, and
leu-531. fig. 9 (a and c) shows
diclofenac bound to mcox-2 with

murine v349i by  xxxd2517xxx  was
slow, time-dependent, and functionally irreversible.
an interesting question is posed
as to why  xxxd2517xxx  is such a poor
inhibitor of wild-type mcox-2 and
yet potently and irreversibly inhibits
the v349i mutant. it seems likely
that the bulkier isoleucine residue
reduces the size of the small hydrophobic binding pocket and increases contacts in the pocket for
binding interactions between the
inhibitor and protein to occur. ile349 also may influence the movement and location of neighboring
residues or secondary shell residues
and could position the hydroxyl of
ser-530 closer to the chlorine atom
of  xxxd2517xxx  and strengthen a
halogen bond. as mentioned above,
our data suggest that chlorine is a
preferred substituent for potent
cox inhibition and may also influence cox-2 selectivity.
