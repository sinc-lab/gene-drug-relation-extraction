summary: to evaluate the significance of inborn metabolic disorders of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, 450 children with unspecific neurological symptoms were
comprehensively studied; 200 healthy children were recruited as controls. uracil and
thymine as well as their degradation products in urine were determined with an improved method based on reversed-phase hplc coupled with electrospray ionization
tandem mass spectrometry and detection by multiple-reaction monitoring using stableisotope-labelled reference compounds as internal standards.
from the results of the control group we established age-related reference ranges
of all pyrimidine degradation products. in the patient group, two children with  xxxg652xxx  ( xxxg652xxx ) deficiency were identified; one of these was
homozygous for the exon 14-skipping mutation of the  xxxg652xxx  gene. in addition, two
patients with high uracil, dihydrouracil and beta-ureidopropionate were found to have  xxxg1638xxx  deficiency. in the urine of 9 patients, beta-alanine was markedly
elevated owing to treatment with vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of  xxxg8xxx , which interferes with beta-alanine breakdown. four patients had exclusively high
levels of beta-aminoisobutyrate (beta-aib) due to a low activity of the d-beta-aib-pyruvate
aminotransferase, probably without clinical significance.
in conclusion, quantitative investigation of pyrimidine metabolites in children with
unexplained neurological symptoms, particularly epileptic seizures with or without
psychomotor retardation, can be recommended as a helpful tool for diagnosis in clinical

practice. sensitive methods and age-related reference ranges enable the detection of
partial enzyme deficiencies.
the pyrimidines thymine and uracil are catabolized by three consecutive enzymatic steps
in humans:  xxxg652xxx  ( xxxg652xxx ;  xxxg630xxx .2.),  xxxg653xxx 
( xxxg653xxx .) and beta-ureidopropionase (ec 3.5.1.6.) (figure 1). inborn errors in the pyrimidine degradation pathway have been reported to cause a wide variety of clinical presentations, which include failure to thrive, dysmorphic features or unspecific neurological
deficits (epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, muscular hypotonia or hypertonia, autism) (van gennip et al 1997). unfortunately, an unequivocal diagnosis of these
disorders by clinical features only failed since symptoms vary from severe retardation with
therapy refractory epilepsy to asymptomatic individuals (ohse et al 2002).
analysis of pyrimidines and the related metabolites in body fluids has been proposed as
a strategy for diagnosis (au et al 2003; kuhara et al 2003). since pyrimidine metabolites or
analogues are also used as therapeutic agents for oncological or antiviral therapies, definite
diagnosis prior to commencement of therapy is essential. a sensitive and specific method is
necessary for determining simultaneously all pyrimidine degradation products. almost all
methods described so far have been developed to quantify single metabolites only (asai et al
2000; bakkeren et al 1984; daves et al 1997; de abbreu et al 1982; van gennip et al 1992).
recently, a new hplc–tandem mass spectrometric (ms/ms) method for determination of
pyrimidine metabolites in urine has been established, but with the exception of detection
of beta-amino acids (ito et al 2000; van lenthe et al 2000). in the first stage of our project
we have substantially improved the analytical procedure using tandem mass spectrometry
(a) to determine comprehensively all metabolites including the amino acids beta-alanine and
beta-aminoisobutyrate and (b) to enhance significantly the sensitivity and precision of this
method. finally, pyrimidines and their metabolites were investigated in the urine of 450
children who suffered from unspecific neurological symptoms; 200 healthy children served
as an age matched control group (figure 2).

materials and methods
standards and chemicals: uracil, thymine, dihydrouracil (dhu), dihydrothymine (dht),
beta-ureidopropionate (beta-up), beta-alanine (beta-ala), beta-aminoisobutyrate (beta-aib), creatinine
and (2 h3 )creatinine were purchased from sigma (taufkirchen, germany). the internal
standards [13 c3 15 n]beta-ala and [2 h4 ]thymine were from aldrich (taufkirchen, germany);
[15 n2 ]uracil was from chemotrade (leipzig, germany). [2 h4 ]dhu, [2 h6 ]dht, [2 h4 ]betaup, beta-ureidoisobutyrate (beta-uib), [2 h6 ]beta-uib and [2 h6 ]beta-aib were obtained by chemical
synthesis as described (heinkele et al 2001). 2- xxxd3026xxx , acetic acid, ammonium hydroxide
and  xxxd2154xxx  were obtained from merck (darmstadt, germany).
urine samples: urine samples were collected from 450 children with unspecific neurological symptoms, including epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, muscle
weakness and autism as well as failure to thrive and dysmorphic features, who were not
primarily considered for investigation of disorders of the pyrimidine degradation pathway.

we asked the attending physician to fill in a form indicating what kind of neurological
and somatic symptoms had been observed in the patient and whether pathological laboratory parameters had been found. additionally, urine samples from 200 healthy children who
served as a control group were obtained from healthy brothers or sisters of patients and from
outpatients attending for reasons not interfering with pyrimidine metabolism (e.g. without

a similar age profile from newborn upto 18 years.
liquid urine samples were preserved with two drops of chloroform and then sent to our
laboratory at room temperature within 48 h. the urine samples were stored at −20◦ c until
analysis.

the study was approved by the ethical committee of the university of heidelberg and
informed consent was obtained from all parents or patients from both groups.
hplc-esi ms/ms analysis: urine was centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000g for 10 min to remove the
debris and diluted to 5 mmol/l creatinine or lower. diluted urine (200 µl) was added to
20 µl of the internal standard mixture (1000 µmol/l for [2 h4 ]dhu, 500 µmol/l for the
other internal standards) into a vial of a microtitre plate. the urine was then filtered through
a 96-well filtration plate (millipore multiscreen, 0.45 µm durapore membrane), dried, and
dissolved into 200 µl of the mobile phase; 35 µl was used for hplc-ms/ms analysis.
a pe series 200 hplc system (perkin elmer, germany) with gradient pump and autosampler was used. an aqua hplc column (250 × 2.0 mm; particle size 5 µm; c18 , 125 å, phenomenex) was used with a guard column (security guard; ods, 4 × 2.0 mm; phenomenex).
the mobile phases consisted of acetic acid (0.05 mol/l), first adjusted to ph 4.0 with nh4 oh
and then with addition of  xxxd2154xxx  up to ph 2.8 (a); and a–isopropanol, 1:1 by volume
(b). the elution gradient was as follows: 0–2 min, 0% b to 48% b; 2–7 min, 48% b to
60%; 7–7.1 min, 60% b to 100%; 7.1–8 min, 100% b; 8–8.1 min, 100% b to 100% a; then
equilibration with 100% a for 7 min. all gradients were linear; flow rate was 0.25 ml/min. a
splitter was used between the hplc column and the electrospray ionization (esi) source of
the mass spectrometer; 40–50 µl/min of eluate was introduced into the mass spectrometer.
a pe sciex api 365 triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (pe sciex, ontario,
canada) with an electrospray ion source was used in the positive-ion mode. nitrogen was
used as the nebulizing gas and as the collision gas; capillary voltage was set at 5000 v.
the mass spectrometer was operated in mrm (multiple reaction monitoring) mode with a
dwell time of 100 ms to detect specific transitions of precursor ions to product ions for each
analyte. ion transitions for each metabolite are listed in table 1. mass spectrometer settings
were optimized using a 100 µmol/l solution of each pyrimidine degradation product.
quantification and validation: calibration mixtures were prepared with a fixed amount
of internal standards and increasing concentrations of each substance of interest (0.1 up
to 1000 µmol/l). calibration curves were obtained by linear regression for the ratio of

against the concentration of the analyte.
the intra-assay variation of the method was established by measuring 10 times a native urine and a urine enriched with synthetic compounds at medium (100 µmol/l) concentration. the inter-assay variation was established with the same urines, measured in
five consecutive weeks. the results are listed in table 2. correct identification of deficiencies of the pyrimidine-degrading enzymes was confirmed with urine samples from
patients with established  xxxg652xxx  deficiency (mckusick 274270),
 xxxg653xxx  deficiency (mckusick 222748) and beta-ureidopropionase deficiency
(mckusick 606673) (data not shown).
genotyping: detection of the  xxxg652xxx ∗ 2a allele was performed by denaturing hplc as
described previously (fischer et al 2003).
statistical analysis: all values are presented as mean and standard deviation or as median
and range. median values were compared using the mann–whitney u-test. for comparison
among several groups, anova (kruskal–wallis test) was used with subsequent dunn’s
multiple comparison test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
deviations from gaussian distribution were tested using the kolmogorov–smirnov test;
p-values were calculated with the dallal and wilkinson approximation to lilliefors’ method
(american statistician 1986: 40, 294–296). all statistical testing was performed with graphpad prism version 2.0 (graphpad software inc., san diego, ca, usa).
results
pyrimidine degradation products (uracil, thymine, dhu, dht, beta-up, beta-uib, beta-ala, betaaib) and creatinine were investigated in the urine of 450 children with neurological abnormalities by reversed-phase hplc-esi-ms/ms. according to the information from the

attending physicians, developmental retardation (65%), epilepsy (39%) and muscular hypotonia (30%) were the predominant neurological features. additional somatic symptoms
such as microsomia (13%), ophthalmological diseases (11%) and dysmorphia (9%) were
reported less often (table 3). only in a minority were pathological laboratory parameters
found (elevated lactate 3.6%; high transaminases 2.4%; elevated ck 2.2%; hyperammonaemia 1.8%).
urine samples from 200 healthy children were analysed as a control group. both groups
had a similar age profile from newborn up to 18 years (patients, median 4.8 years; controls,
median 5.1 years). the results, expressed as µmol/mmol creatinine, are summarized in
table 4. all values show broad variability and they are not normally distributed, except for
uracil and dhu in the control group. for comparison of the patients with the control group,
the patients with clearly pathological values were excluded. significant differences were
observed for thymine, showing lower values for the patients ( p = 0.002), and for dhu,
with higher values for the patients ( p = 0.0065). all other pyrimidine metabolites were not
significantly different. creatinine concentration in urine was significantly lower in patients
than in controls ( p < 0.0001).
in the patient group, 17 children with highly elevated urinary excretion of pyrimidines
and/or metabolites were detected (table 5). two patients showed a urinary profile of  xxxg652xxx  ( xxxg652xxx ) deficiency with pathological concentrations of uracil
and thymine. in the first patient, homozygosity for the exon-14-skipping mutation of the
dihydroyrimidine dehydrogenase gene ( xxxg652xxx ∗ 2a/ ∗ 2a allele; table 5, patient 1) confirmed
the phenotypically established diagnosis of  xxxg652xxx  deficiency. the second patient showed
high values of uracil and thymine only during intermittent illness (acute inflammation of the
middle ear, gastroenteritis), whereas urinary concentrations for both were within the normal
range when he was well (table 5, patient 2). he was not a carrier of the exon-14-skipping
mutation. further molecular studies of the  xxxg652xxx  gene are in process.
clinically the first patient, a 3-year-old girl, presented with recurrent tonic seizures accompanied by absent responsiveness for 3–5 min, beginning at the age of 1 12 year. psychomotor
development was normal. the second patient is a 4-year-old boy who, beginning at the age
of 7 months, showed series of epileptic seizures during periods of fever and infection with
regression of reactivity and loss of motor skills. after such periods it took him a long time
to regain these abilities. he suffers from epilepsy with tonic-clonic as well as myoclonic
seizures, ataxic infantile cerebral palsy and severe psychomotor and speech retardation.
in addition, two patients with high levels of uracil, dhu and beta-up were found to have
 xxxg1638xxx  (otc) deficiency resulting in a high concentration of carbamyl

phosphate that cannot enter the urea cycle and is therefore degraded through the uracil pathway (figure 1). one of these patients is a 6-year-old boy with recurrent episodes of vomiting
and reduced consciousness. in an episode of gastroenteritis and unconsciousness an ammonia level of 448 µmol/l was diagnosed. subsequent diagnostic investigations showed
low levels of citrulline and arginine in tandem mass spectrometry amino acid profile and
a pathological profile in pyrimidine screening (table 5). mutational analysis revealed a
hemizygous r40h mutation. after initiation of specific metabolic therapy, uracil was still
elevated (72 µmol/mmol creatinine), whereas dhu was at a physiological level.
the other patient is a 9-year-old girl with psychomotor retardation, pigmentary retinitis,
nystagmus, hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent episodes of hyperammonaemia. previously,
an elevated uracil with a slight elevation of thymine led to the investigation of  xxxg652xxx 
activity in fibroblasts with normal results. in our screening, high levels of uracil, dhu
and beta-up were detected (table 5), whereas thymine, dht and beta-uib were in the normal
range. an allopurinol test was performed, which revealed pathologically elevated  xxxd2794xxx 
and orotidine before administration of allopurinol. after allopurinol, a massive increase of
 xxxd2794xxx  and orotidine was indicative of otc deficiency. the otc gene is located on
the short arm of chromosome x in the region 21.1. the gene responsible for pigmentary
retinitis is located in close proximity. therefore, a larger deletion in this region could
be responsible for the clinical combination of pigmentary retinitis and otc deficiency.
molecular investigations of the x chromosome are in progress.
nine patients were found to excrete markedly elevated beta-ala owing to treatment with
vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of the  xxxg8xxx , which interferes with breakdown of beta-ala.
in addition, 4 patients presented exclusively with highly elevated levels of beta-aib. deficiency of methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase was excluded by analysis of 3hydroxyisobutyrate, which showed normal values. in about 1% of the healthy population a
hyper-beta-aiburia is found due to low activity of the d-beta-aib-pyruvate aminotransferase,
probably without clinical significance.
when the influence of sex on the pyrimidine degradation pathway was investigated in
the control group, higher levels were detected in females for beta-up and beta-ala, but not
for uracil. no significant differences were found in the patient group. with regard to age,
all children were stratified into the following groups: 0 to 1 year (infancy = 143 patients,
56 controls); 2 to 5 years (toddlerhood and preschool = 151 patients, 61 controls); 6
to 10 years (school age = 99 patients, 54 controls); and 11 to 18 years (adolescence =
57 patients, 29 controls). statistically significant differences were found for both patients
and controls. in general, the excretion of pyrimidine metabolites in relation to creatinine
elimination decreased with increasing age. whereas the amounts of thymine, uracil and
their degradation products remain the same irrespective of age, the creatinine excretion
more than doubles (3.2 µmol/l in the first year versus 8.4 µmol/l at 11–18 years).
discussion
the frequency and clinical relevance of pyrimidine degradation disorders in children with
largely unspecific neurological abnormalities are as yet unknown. the overall number of
patients diagnosed worldwide is extremely low. this might be explained by the fact that

reliable analysis of pyrimidine metabolism is not commonly established and, therefore, is
presently available only in a few specialized laboratories. the first aim of our study was
to develop a sensitive and specific method that allows a selective and rapid screening for
these disorders. to assess the impact of metabolic screening for pyrimidine inborn errors,
urine samples were systematically investigated of 450 randomly selected children with
unspecific neurological symptoms in whom pyrimidine degradation disorders had not yet
been considered by the referring physician.
two children with a urine profile of  xxxg652xxx  deficiency were
detected in this population. in one of these patients,  xxxg652xxx  deficiency was confirmed by homozygosity for the exon-14-skipping mutation in the  xxxg652xxx 
gene. the second patient excreted similarly elevated levels of thymine and uracil in urine
only during intercurrent illnesses (table 5), but was not a carrier of the  xxxg652xxx ∗ 2a allele. interestingly, his clinically asymptomatic sister also excreted pathologically elevated
amounts of thymine and uracil at times of intercurrent infection. to investigate a possible intermediate form of  xxxg652xxx  deficiency, further molecular
investigations are in progress to identify known or novel mutations of the  xxxg652xxx  gene.
taken together, the urine profiles of both of these patients suggest that there is no correlation between the amount of uracil and thymine excretion and the severity of impairment. whereas the second patient with only intermittent episodes of pathological excretion is severely affected (e.g. series of epileptic seizures, loss of motor skills), the first
patient has developed age-appropriatly despite her epilepsy and continuous elevation of
pyrimidines.
moreover, some defects in pyrimidine metabolism may result in highly elevated levels
only under specific catabolic situations such as infectious episodes, possibly as a result
of higher breakdown of cells, increased metabolism and/or reduced activity of the salvage
system. it is not so far understood why these rapid changes of metabolite concentrations may
be associated with a more pronounced impairment of metabolic function and psychomotor
retardation.
in 2% of our patients we found moderate elevations of dhu (30–70 µmol/mmol creatinine) and dht (4–16 µmol/mmol creatinine) compared to reference values in healthy
controls (see table 4). it is interesting to note that kuhara and colleagues (2003) also found
only slightly elevated excretion of dhu and dht in patients with  xxxg653xxx 
deficiency, whereas other groups reported much higher levels in those patients (assmann
et al 1997; van kuilenburg et al 1998; wevers et al 1999). the explanation for this observation is still unknown, but systematic mutational screening for functionally relevant genetic
variants in the  xxxg653xxx  gene may bring more insight in the future.
no patient was identified with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency. this is not surprising since,
so far, only three patients with this defect have been published. one presented with hypotonia
and dystonic movements, the second patient is asymptomatic, and the third presented with
a febrile status epilepticus (assmann et al 1998, 2004; ohse et al 2002).
the finding of slight elevations of pyrimidine degradation products implies that a quantitative screening method and age-related reference ranges are indispensable for a reliable
identification of patients with defects of pyrimidine metabolism. we could not find any
causal relation between the pyrimidine catabolism disorders and the clinical presentation
despite the speculation that rapid changes in metabolite concentrations might cause greater

disturbances than constant levels. further studies are needed. since dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase and  xxxg653xxx  deficiency have been found in asymptomatic individuals, and since the symptomatic cases published are associated with a wide variety
of clinical symptoms, wider screening for these metabolic defects is necessary both to
determine the frequency in healthy and diseased patients and to provide more information
regarding the natural clinical course. for this purpose, it would be interesting to analyse urine
samples of diagnosed patients in various physiological states (e.g. catabolic and anabolic).
nevertheless, quantitative pyrimidine screening for children with unexplained neurological
symptoms, particularly epileptic seizures with or without psychomotor retardation, appears
to be justified.
otc deficiency is routinely detected by determination of amino acids in plasma and of
 xxxd2794xxx  in urine. it is coincidental that during collection of specimens from children with
unexplained neurological symptoms we identified two patients with otc deficiency. the
high amount of uracil may mistakenly tend to the diagnosis of  xxxg652xxx  deficiency; thus it
is of major importance to screen comprehensively for degradation products using different
methods (e.g. tandem ms amino acid profile). the accompanying hyperammonaemia should
always raise the suspicion of otc deficiency.
since the use of pyrimidine-containing agents is strongly contraindicated in patients
with complete enzyme deficiency because of severe side-effects (van gennip et al 1997;
van kuilenburg et al 2000) and possible fatal outcome (van kuilenburg et al 2001), an
unequivocal diagnosis is required before starting therapy. the methodology described could
prove very valuable for this purpose. homozygous deficiencies can easily be detected before
therapy, whereas heterozygous deficiencies can be ruled out after application of a testing
dose. table 6 lists examples of medications containing pyrimidines that would result in an
extra load on the degradation pathway. the effect may be more pronounced with drugs with
modifications in the pyrimidine moiety then with those modified in the sugar moiety.
it is advisable to relate the excretion of pyrimidine metabolites to the concentration of creatinine in urine. otherwise, discrimination between normal and pathological values becomes
difficult owing to the variability of creatinine in patients and controls. for instance, without
correlation of metabolite excretion to creatinine, higher pyrimidine metabolite levels would
be determined in controls than in patients. although the distributions of age and sex in our
patient and control groups were comparable, we found significantly lower creatinine levels in
patients. interestingly 8% of children suffered from a failure to thrive, 13% showed microsomia, and 30% were reported to have muscular hypotonia. these clinical symptoms are often
related to a lower body mass index, which may explain lower urinary creatinine levels in
the patient group. since all urine samples were preserved with chloroform before shipment
and creatinine is per se a very stable metabolite, exogenous alteration appears unlikely.
generally, when we compared levels of pyrimidine degradation products in patients and
controls, the median levels of dht and especially dhu were higher in patients. surprisingly,
thymine excretion is higher in controls, whereas uracil, beta-up, beta-uib, beta-ala and beta-aib
show equal concentrations in both groups. although the intra-assay cv for thymine is high
(nearly 20%), misinterpretation of data can be excluded since metabolic diseases with an
exclusive elevation of thymine are unknown.
quantitative investigations of pyrimidine metabolites in children with unexplained
neurological symptoms including epileptic seizures and psychomotor retardation can be

recommended as a useful tool for diagnosis in clinical practice. moreover, not only defects of the pyrimidine degradation pathway can be detected by the analysis of pyrimidine
metabolites. as demonstrated in the present paper, pathological values can also be associated with urea cycle defects, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency,
hyper-beta-aiburia, as well as with nonmetabolic disorders (e.g. serious infection) or use of
medications (e.g. vigabatrin).
