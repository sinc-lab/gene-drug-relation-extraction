the frequency and impact of allergic diseases are often underestimated.1 a key
facilitator of the allergic response is immunoglobulin e (ige) that is present on the
surface of mast cells and basophils.2 interaction of the allergen with ige and its receptor complex leads to activation of these cells and release of the substances, including
histamine, that cause allergic symptoms.2
because of the central role of histamine in allergic responses, many allergic
conditions are treated with antihistamines, including allergic rhinitis and urticaria.3,4
antihistamines have been in clinical use for .70 years, and the pharmacological
characteristics of these agents have been evolving over that time.5
the objective of this article is to review the current burden of allergic rhinitis and
urticaria in asia pacific, to briefly describe the evolution of antihistamine pharmacology, and to systematically review the pharmacological characteristics and clinical
results of  xxxd338xxx , a new antihistamine that is highly selective for the h1 histamine
receptor.

abstract: allergic rhinitis and urticaria are common allergic diseases that may have a major
negative impact on patients’ quality of life.  xxxd338xxx , a novel new-generation antihistamine
that is highly selective for the  xxxg1078xxx , has a rapid onset and prolonged duration
of action. this agent does not interact with the cytochrome p450 system and does not undergo
significant metabolism in humans, suggesting that it has very low potential for drug–drug
interactions, and does not require dose adjustment in renal impairment. as  xxxd338xxx  is not
metabolized and is excreted largely unchanged, hepatic impairment is not expected to increase
systemic exposure above the drug’s safety margin.  xxxd338xxx  has demonstrated similar efficacy to
cetirizine and  xxxd1846xxx  in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and, in a vienna chamber
study, a potentially longer duration of action than fexofenadine in patients with asymptomatic
seasonal allergic rhinitis. it has also shown significant efficacy (similar to that of cetirizine) and
safety in the long-term treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis.  xxxd338xxx  showed similar efficacy
to levocetirizine in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria and can be safely used at doses
of up to fourfold higher than standard dosage (80 mg once daily). the fourfold higher than
standard dose is specified as an acceptable second-line treatment option for urticaria in international guidelines.  xxxd338xxx  is generally well tolerated, both at standard and at supratherapeutic
doses, appears to have less sedative potential than other second-generation antihistamines, and
has no cardiotoxicity. based on its pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, and tolerability profile,
 xxxd338xxx  will be valuable in the management of allergic rhinitis and urticaria.

research methodology
for the systematic review of  xxxd338xxx  data, a pubmed search
was undertaken of all publications including “ xxxd338xxx ” in
the title and/or abstract. no date limits were applied. all
preclinical and clinical trials were assessed for inclusion in
the review. attention was preferentially given to randomized
controlled trials, with appropriate controls for variation and
bias (eg, placebo group, blinding).

burden of allergic diseases in asia
pacific
allergic rhinitis
allergic rhinitis is a symptomatic condition of the nose
caused by allergen exposure and ige-mediated inflammation.6
allergic rhinitis is defined as intermittent or persistent,
and its severity is classed as mild or moderate-to-severe.6
historically, symptoms of the condition were categorized as
occupational, seasonal, or perennial, but this classification is
now unsatisfactory because these categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.7 in 2001, the document “allergic
rhinitis and its impact on asthma” (aria) recommended
replacing the terms “seasonal” and “perennial” rhinitis by
intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis,
respectively.8 subsequently, “intermittent” and “persistent”
are not precisely synonymous with seasonal and perennial
allergic rhinitis.
allergic rhinitis is frequently encountered in primary
care. patients report that allergic rhinitis has a marked
detrimental effect on their sleep, social life, quality of life,
and attendance and functioning at school and work.6,9–11
another issue is that allergic rhinitis commonly coexists
with other forms or allergic disease. considerable clinical
and epidemiological evidence also exists of an association
between asthma and allergic rhinitis.12 it has been estimated
that up to 75% of patients with asthma have rhinitis9,10 and
that approximately one-third of patients with allergic rhinitis
have asthma.10 comorbid links between allergic rhinitis and
sinusitis, conjunctivitis, otitis media, and nasal polyposis
have been documented, although the extent of such links
remains unclear.12 the economic burden of allergic rhinitis
is frequently underrated, and indirect costs of the disorder
are extensive.6,13
allergic rhinitis is a worldwide health problem, with
a prevalence estimated at between 10% and 30%, and it
is associated with considerable morbidity.11 the disorder
is estimated to affect the lives of .500 million people
worldwide.6 the burden is particularly high and increasing
in asia pacific, where many people now live in crowded

cities with high levels of environmental pollution.14 the
allergies in asia pacific survey reported an adult prevalence of 9% across the region, with 63% of patients having
seasonal or intermittent allergies.11 however, the prevalence
of allergic rhinitis subtypes does differ between countries
in asia pacific. in several southeast asian surveys, ~70%
of patients with allergic rhinitis had persistent disease
and ~30% had intermittent symptoms,15,16 whereas in the
people’s republic of china, ~25% of patients with allergic
rhinitis had the persistent form and 75% had intermittent
disease.17

urticaria
another common disease is urticaria. patients with urticaria
typically develop wheals (hives), angioedema, or both.4,18
usually, about half of all patients with urticaria have
associated angioedema.19 if the condition has a duration
of ,6 weeks, it is acute. if it persists for .6 weeks, or
recurs, it is chronic. symptoms of the disorder may endure
for several months or years.20 the most frequent causes
of acute urticaria, which may affect up to 15%–25% of
all individuals at some stage in their lives, are viral infections (especially affecting the upper respiratory tract), food
allergies, and drug adverse reactions.18 physical effects,
systemic disease, or long-term infection may also lead to
urticaria/angioedema.20,21 in patients with chronic urticaria,
the condition is often idiopathic (ie, has no discernible cause
in ~55%–80% of cases); this is known as chronic spontaneous urticaria.19,22 the counterpart is chronic inducible
urticaria, which is caused by physical stimuli such as cold,
heat, sun, or pressure.4
unfortunately, there are limited data on the burden of
urticaria in asia pacific. internationally, chronic spontaneous urticaria is estimated to have a point prevalence
of ~0.5%–1.0%.1,23,24 the peak age of occurrence is usually
between 20 years and 40 years, and typical disease duration
is 1–5 years, although this can be greater in many cases.
as with allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria is a devastating
disorder that can have a major negative influence on a
patient’s quality of life, including vitality, sleep, mobility,
and social life.23,25–27 because of emotional distress, patients
with chronic spontaneous urticaria often have anxiety,
depression, and somatoform disorders.28 as a result, the
societal burden of the condition is great in terms of both
direct and indirect health care costs.23,26 the disorder is
often managed improperly, for example, with the repetitive use of oral corticosteroids that have significant safety
concerns.29

role of histamine and the h1
receptor subtype in ige-mediated
allergic diseases
histamine has a key role in the pathophysiology of allergic
inflammation.30 after exposure to an allergen, specific
antibodies of the ige type are produced in genetically predisposed individuals.30 these interact with receptors on the
surface of basophils and mast cells. the consequence is a
series of intracellular reactions culminating in exocytosis and
the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators
such as  xxxd2973xxx  and cytokines.4,30 various
drugs (eg, morphine) can also cause direct displacement of
histamine from its storage granules.30
the consequences of histamine release include receptormediated smooth muscle cell contraction in the gastrointestinal
and respiratory tracts, sensory nerve stimulation, vasodilation,
plasma extravasation, and cellular recruitment, for example, to
urticarial lesions.4,30 these effects lead to, among other things,
erythema, flushing, nasal congestion, and pruritus.30
besides its mediatory activity in the early allergic response,
histamine contributes to the late allergic response by stimulating the production of cellular adhesion molecules, class ii
antigens, and cytokines.30

four principal histamine receptor subtypes exist: h1,
h2, h3, and h4. these are g-protein-coupled receptors that
transfer extracellular signals via g proteins, which act as
intermediaries between cell surface receptors and intracellular second messengers (figure 1).5,30 h1 and h2 receptors are
widely distributed throughout the body, but the h3 subtype is
mainly located in the central nervous system (cns) and the
h4 subtype in hematopoietic tissues.30 the allergic response
is primarily mediated by the  xxxg1078xxx  subtype.
h1 receptors are ubiquitous and are found in the adrenal medulla, cns, endothelial and epithelial cells, heart,
immune cells, sensory nerves, and smooth muscle.30 in the
cns, most of the postsynaptic actions of histamine are mediated by h1 receptors.30 this leads to activity on sleep–wake
cycles and probably explains the sedative effects noted with
first-generation antihistamines that cross the blood–brain
barrier.21 via h1 receptors, histamine also causes smooth
muscle cell contraction in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and stimulation of sensory nerves. outcomes
include pruritus, sneezing, increased vascular permeability,
and edema.30
antihistamines are not structurally related to histamine
and are not competitive antagonists of histamine binding

figure 2 direct downregulation of allergic inflammation by h1 antihistamines.

to h1 receptors; rather, antihistamines bind to different
sites from histamine on h1 receptors.5 therefore, these
antihistamines are inverse agonists rather than receptor
antagonists.5,31,32 they are referred to as “h1 antihistamines”
rather than “histamine antagonists”.5
when h1 antihistamines are bound to h1 receptors, they
interfere with histamine action on sensory neurons and small
blood vessels, directly downregulating allergic inflammation
(figure 2). this downregulation also takes place indirectly
through transcription factor nuclear factor-kappab and through
calcium ion channels.33

history of antihistamines
histamine was discovered in 1907 by windaus and
vogt, after decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine.33–35
twenty years later, in 1927, emanuel identified histamine
as a constituent in normal tissues, notably the lungs,35 and in
1937, bovet and staub discovered antihistamines by demonstrating that synthesized agents could block the effects
of histamine.36 a few years later, in 1942, the first antihistamine, phenbenzamine (antergan), was introduced into
commercial use.5,33,34 this was closely followed by diphenhydramine,  xxxd375xxx , and chlorpheniramine in the
mid-1940s, promethazine later that decade, and hydroxyzine
in the 1950s.34,35

in 1957, daniel bovet received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his major therapeutic contribution.
more specifically, this was for his discoveries that synthesized
agents that inhibited the actions of various body substances,
particularly on the vascular and musculoskeletal systems.37
a key scientific discovery in the 1960s was that there
was more than one type of histamine receptor, and in 1966,
ash and schild suggested that the receptor blocked by antihistamines be called the  xxxg1078xxx , and agents blocking it
be called  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists.38
second-generation h1 antihistamines were introduced in
the 1980s. these agents represented a major enhancement
in antihistamine development because they had no or only
minimal sedative activity.5 furthermore, they were highly
selective for h1 receptors and were devoid of anticholinergic
activity.5 however, because of differences in drug specificity
for active transporter proteins (eg, p-glycoprotein [p-gp])
across the blood–brain barrier, some second-generation
agents may enter the cns to a greater extent than others.5,39
cetirizine,  xxxd1846xxx , and loratadine, especially at high
dosages, are potentially more sedating than fexofenadine
and levocetirizine.5,40
another major drawback for some second-generation
agents was documentation in the late 1990s of significant cardiotoxicity. that is,  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine were shown to
block the delayed rectifier k+ current (ikr), which is essential
for cardiac repolarization.5 this gave rise to the potential for
qt interval prolongation and life-threatening ventricular
arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes. such cardiotoxic
potential is now well established and has been extensively
reviewed.5 in most countries,  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine have
now been withdrawn from the market.4,5,41,42
the evolution of second-generation antihistamines was
essentially based on experimentation with, and modification
of, forerunning first-generation compounds. further modifications then led to the introduction of other second-generation
agents: for example, stereoselective investigation led to
levocetirizine, and the knowledge of metabolism pathway of
loratadine led to the development of  xxxd1846xxx . a recent
development is the dual platelet activator factor and  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist rupatadine,43 which undergoes
extensive hepatic metabolism to produce active metabolites,
including  xxxd1846xxx .43,44
however,  xxxd338xxx  (figure 3) is a novel, benzimidazole–piperidine derivative that is a highly selective h1
antihistamine.45,46 unlike certain other antihistamines, it is
a distinct chemical entity and not derived structurally from
other compounds in this class.32,47 it has been commercially
available internationally since march 2011.48

properties of the “ideal”
antihistamine
the aria guidelines stipulate that before a physician
prescribes pharmacotherapy, the following pertinent factors should be considered: the efficacy, safety and costeffectiveness of treatment, patient preference, the goals
of treatment, anticipated adherence to treatment, disease
severity, and control, as well as the presence of concurrent conditions.6 an extension of this is that the guidelines
also provide a detailed list of “properties that should be
met by oral h1-antihistamines” (table 1). fundamental
among these properties are potent and selective blocking
activity at h1 receptors, a rapid onset and long duration of
action, efficacy in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and against
all symptoms, including nasal obstruction, no interaction
with cytochrome p450 (cyp 450), no sedative activity or
cognitive or psychomotor impairment, no anticholinergic
activity, no cardiac safety concerns, and no potential for
tachyphylaxis.6
as outlined in the following sections,  xxxd338xxx  – as
a modern, second-generation h 1 antihistamine – has

 xxxd338xxx  pharmacology
preclinical trials
for any new chemical entity with potential for therapeutic
use, initial in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies are needed
to fully characterize the compound’s pharmacological profile. if efficacy is confirmed, and no major safety or toxicity
concerns are identified, progression can continue to phase i
clinical studies in healthy volunteers and then to phase ii–iii
clinical trials in the proposed indication.
with novel antihistamines (eg,  xxxd338xxx ), a specific goal
of in vitro studies is to confirm that the test agent has marked
selectivity – high affinity for histamine h1 receptors, but
minimal effects at receptors for other mediators and amines.39
thus,  xxxd338xxx  (inhibition constant [ki] 44 nm) was shown to
dose-dependently inhibit 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding to h1 receptors in the guinea pig cerebellum, with an affinity approximately threefold greater than that of cetirizine (ki 143 nm)
and fivefold greater than that of fexofenadine (ki 246 nm).49
similar findings were obtained in a human embryonic kidney
cell line (figure 4; ki 64 nm).49 additional in vitro trials
demonstrated that  xxxd338xxx  had no significant antagonist
activity at a diverse range of other receptors: h2, h3, and
h4, 5-ht2a, bradykinin b1, leukotriene d4, n-type voltagedependent calcium receptors, alpha1- and beta2-adrenoceptors, and
m1–m5 muscarinic receptors.39,49
in in vivo studies,  xxxd338xxx  showed antihistaminic activity
in various animal models and produced the following effects:

reduced microvascular leakage from guinea pig trachea and rat
dorsal skin, and reduced histamine-induced bronchospasm and
histamine- and compound 48/80-induced lethality in guinea
pigs.31,50 in these respects,  xxxd338xxx  had effects similar to those

other antiallergic effects of  xxxd338xxx  were demonstrated
in various rodent models. specifically,  xxxd338xxx  reduced
vascular permeability mediated by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats and reduced igg-dependent active cutaneous anaphylaxis. in mice,  xxxd338xxx  reduced ige-dependent
active cutaneous anaphylaxis and the passive arthus reaction
induced by ovine red blood cells.50 again, the magnitude of
these effects was similar to that produced by cetirizine and
superior to that produced by fexofenadine.50

 xxxd338xxx  bioavailability by 30%.48 therefore, it is recommended that  xxxd338xxx  be taken in the fasting state.48
as previously outlined, and as listed in aria guidelines,6
one of the key qualities of an ideal oral h1 antihistamine is
to have no interaction with cyp 450. however, some oral
h1 antihistamines (eg, loratadine, rupatadine) are extensively
transformed to active metabolites by the cyp system in
the liver. this creates significant potential for drug–drug
interactions.7 importantly,  xxxd338xxx  does not interact significantly, either as an inhibitor or as a inducer, with the cyp
enzyme system in vitro,53 and it does not undergo significant
metabolism in humans.48 approximately 95% of an oral
 xxxd338xxx  dose is excreted unchanged in the urine (28%) and
feces (67%).48 this elimination profile markedly reduces the
potential for metabolic drug–drug interactions.
oral  xxxd338xxx  can be administered to patients independently of glomerular filtration rate.54 no dosage adjustments
are needed in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal
impairment.54 however, in patients with moderate–severe
renal insufficiency who are being treated with p-gp inhibitors,
such as cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, ketoconazole,
or ritonavir,  xxxd338xxx  should not be administered; these
inhibitors may increase plasma  xxxd338xxx  levels and lead to
increased potential for adverse events.48
as this agent is not metabolized and is excreted largely
unchanged, hepatic impairment is not expected to increase
systemic exposure above the safety margin of the drug.55
therefore, no dosage adjustment is needed in patients with
hepatic impairment.48
 xxxd338xxx  is a substrate for several transporter proteins
in the p-gp and organic anion-transporter protein class.
these transporters have a significant influence on the

 xxxd338xxx  efficacy
the  xxxd338xxx  clinical trial program was designed before
the publication of the 2001 aria guidelines, so the patient
inclusion criteria were based on the former classification of
seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.

seasonal allergic rhinitis
in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trials in a total of 1,402 patients with seasonal
allergic rhinitis, the efficacy of  xxxd338xxx  was compared with
that of cetirizine57 and  xxxd1846xxx .58
in one trial,57 over a 2-week treatment period,  xxxd338xxx 
and cetirizine displayed similar efficacy: both compounds
significantly reduced total symptom score (tss = nasal
symptom score [nss] + nonnasal symptom score [nnss]),
relative to placebo.57 the percentage decrease from baseline
in nss (for nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and
itching) was significantly greater (p,0.001) with  xxxd338xxx 
(-42.4%) and cetirizine (-48.2%) than placebo (-26.9%).
the same was true for nnss (for ocular tearing, redness, and
itching): corresponding percentage changes from baseline
were -49.8%, -51.0%, and -27.6% (figure 6).57
in the other trial,58 similar results to the first study were
obtained for  xxxd338xxx  and  xxxd1846xxx  versus placebo over
a 2-week treatment period. regarding the primary study end
point – area under the curve of tss (auctss) – the mean
value was significantly lower (p,0.001) for  xxxd338xxx  (98.4)
and  xxxd1846xxx  (100.5) than for placebo (118.4).58
in a vienna challenge chamber study performed outside the pollen season in 75 individuals with asymptomatic
seasonal allergic rhinitis, an antihistamine or placebo was
administered immediately before allergen challenge. 56

pharmacokinetic profile of various drugs since p-gp can
be considered as an efflux pump, whereas organic aniontransporter proteins can facilitate drug uptake.55  xxxd338xxx  has
shown a high affinity for the p-gp efflux pump;55 this effect
restricts transit across the blood–brain barrier and limits the
potential for sedation.30,32
differences between the transporter protein-binding
profiles of second-generation antihistamines may explain
some of the substantial differences in clinical activity and
tolerability that exist between agents in this class (table 2).
further research in this area is clearly warranted. indeed,
transporter protein interactions might ultimately explain
important clinical differences, such as the potentially longer
duration of action for  xxxd338xxx  over fexofenadine.56

 xxxd338xxx  in allergic rhinitis and urticaria

a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted in europe, argentina, and south africa, compared
the efficacy of  xxxd338xxx  with that of cetirizine and placebo
over 4 weeks in 651 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis;
in an open-label, extension phase, 513 patients were treated
with  xxxd338xxx  20 mg once daily for 12 months,60 the longest
analysis to date with any antihistamine. there was no statistically significant difference between groups in auctss from
baseline to day 28.60 however, there was a region-specific
effect: primary efficacy was significantly better in the antihistamine versus placebo groups in europe and argentina
(p=0.039). conversely, no significant difference was evident
in south africa, where patients reported a relatively high
placebo response rate.60 during the open-label extension
phase,  xxxd338xxx  significantly reduced tss, nss, nss without
blocked symptoms, nnss, and constituent symptoms after
both the patients’ and investigators’ assessments.60 the longterm extension phase of this study also demonstrated that
 xxxd338xxx  was safe and well tolerated during extended use.60
the proven efficacy of  xxxd338xxx  in perennial allergic
rhinitis is important for physicians in the southeast asian
region, given the high proportion of patients who have persistent allergic rhinitis in this part of the world.15,16

urticaria
a 4-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study compared the efficacy of  xxxd338xxx  with that
of levocetirizine in a total of 525 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria.61  xxxd338xxx  and levocetirizine were similarly
effective and both significantly more effective than placebo
(p,0.001), in reducing mean tss (for pruritus severity,
number of wheals, and maximum size of wheals) over 2 weeks
and 4 weeks (figure 8).61 significantly greater improvements
than placebo were noted regarding reduction in dermatology
life quality index score:  xxxd338xxx  -9.45 (p,0.001), levocetirizine -8.94 (p,0.001), and placebo -5.93.61
 xxxd338xxx  is more effective than cetirizine at limiting the
early allergic response, according to the results of a study in
volunteers.62 volunteers received a single oral dose of  xxxd338xxx  20 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, or placebo, before provocation
of a cutaneous wheal and flare response. at 1.5 hours after
the provocation, there was significantly greater inhibition of the
wheal and flare response among those who received  xxxd338xxx 
than in those who received cetirizine or placebo (p,0.02).62

while spontaneous urticaria is the most common
form,23,63 ~25% of patients with urticaria have an inducible
form.  xxxd338xxx  has been evaluated at a range of doses, from
the recommended dose of 20 mg to four times this dosage (ie,
80 mg once daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, 7-day study in patients with acquired cold urticaria. a response rate (percentage of patients symptom free)
of 60% was obtained.64 the incidence of adverse events at
all  xxxd338xxx  doses (20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg) was similar to
placebo,64 demonstrating that  xxxd338xxx  is well tolerated even
at doses two or four times higher than the recommended daily
dose. further research is needed to demonstrate its efficacy
in other inducible forms of urticaria, which may include
urticaria induced by pressure, heat, sun exposure, exercise,
or contact with specific allergens.
the use of supratherapeutic doses of  xxxd338xxx  in the
study of patients with cold urticaria is consistent with international guideline recommendations. joint guidelines from
the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology
(eaaci), the global allergy and asthma european network
(ga2len), the european dermatology forum (edf), and
the world allergy organization (wao) now clearly stipulate
that “modern second generation h1-antihistamines are to be
used as first line treatment of urticaria.”4 in addition, these
guidelines recommend “a trial of up to fourfold dose of modern second generation h1-antihistamines as second-line in the
algorithm of treatment.”4 the aim of this recommendation
is to attain complete control of symptoms4 since more than
one-third of patients with chronic urticaria are refractory to
standard-dosage antihistamine therapy.11

a comparison of clinical trial data for second-generation
antihistamines in chronic urticaria suggests that this  xxxd338xxx  dosage (80 mg/d) is significantly more effective than
supratherapeutic dosages of  xxxd1846xxx  and levocetirizine
(figure 9).22 however, use of these compounds at four times
higher than standard doses is certain to raise safety concerns
among some physicians. for instance, the sedative potential
of cetirizine,  xxxd1846xxx , and loratadine will likely be
markedly greater than that of  xxxd338xxx , fexofenadine, and
levocetirizine.5,40 concerns at high dosage may also manifest
about the potential for qtc prolongation, particularly given
the unfavorable history of  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine.31
however,  xxxd338xxx  at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses
in healthy volunteers had no significant influence on ventricular repolarization.  xxxd338xxx  doses of 20 mg and 100 mg
had no clinically significant effect on qtc interval.  xxxd338xxx 
20 mg was also administered with ketoconazole and had no
effect on qtc interval when used in combination.42

 xxxd338xxx  safety
the safety database for  xxxd338xxx  comprises .5,000 individuals involved in well-designed clinical trials. a total
of .3,000 patients were treated with  xxxd338xxx , generally at a
dosage of 20 mg once daily for 2–4 weeks.39 the incidence of
treatment-related adverse events was not markedly different
between  xxxd338xxx  (12.7%), placebo (12.8%), and other antihistamines: cetirizine (14.3%),  xxxd1846xxx  (11.6%), and
levocetirizine (15.8%).39
in the pooled analysis of adverse events, the incidence of
treatment-related cns events was similar between  xxxd338xxx 
and placebo. headache and dizziness showed a similar
incidence between all active treatment and placebo groups.

somnolence occurred with a similar frequency in  xxxd338xxx 
(3.5%) and placebo recipients (2.9%). however, cetirizine was
associated with a significantly greater incidence of somnolence
(7.6%, p,0.001) than  xxxd338xxx  and levocetirizine with a significantly greater incidence (6.1%, p,0.05) than placebo.39
in a large-scale, randomized, double-blind study in a total
of 683 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis,  xxxd338xxx  versus
cetirizine was linked with a significantly smaller incidence
of all drug-related events (14.5% vs 24.6%, p#0.01), fatigue
(0.4% vs 4.8%, p#0.01), and somnolence (1.8% vs 7.5%).57
the clear implication from these data is that, in everyday
clinical practice,  xxxd338xxx  has a better safety profile and
therapeutic index than cetirizine.
high-dosage  xxxd338xxx  (40 mg or 80 mg once daily),
in line with eaaci/ga2len/edf/wao guidelines,4 has
demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of urticaria.64 in a
study in patients with acquired cold urticaria,  xxxd338xxx  was
well tolerated without evidence of an increased incidence of
sedation at doses up to 80 mg/day.64
the cns effects of  xxxd338xxx  80 mg were also evaluated
in healthy volunteers.65 although objective test results (d2
cancellation test, simple reaction time) revealed minor – yet
significant – impairment, high-dosage  xxxd338xxx  did not significantly alter subjective test results (visual analog scale score,
profile of mood states questionnaire score).65 the effects of
 xxxd338xxx  80 mg were equivalent to those of standard-dose
hydroxyzine.65

lack of sedation
in several studies utilizing an active control “arm” comprising the first-generation agent hydroxyzine, standard-dosage
 xxxd338xxx  (20 mg once daily) and higher-dosage  xxxd338xxx 
(40 mg once daily in one study66 and a single 80 mg dose in
another65) had no significant effects on various objective
measures of psychomotor and driving performance.65,66
moreover, when  xxxd338xxx  was administered concurrently
with lorazepam, the extent of psychomotor impairment
was similar to that when lorazepam was administered
alone.39 also, no interaction has been identified between
alcohol and standard-dosage  xxxd338xxx . objective testing
in a placebo-controlled trial revealed an extent of psychomotor impairment with  xxxd338xxx  20 mg + alcohol similar
to that noted after ingestion of alcohol alone, whereas
standard doses of either hydroxyzine or cetirizine exacerbated the impairing effects of alcohol on psychomotor
performance.65
a positron emission tomography study of brain  xxxg1078xxx  occupancy in 12 healthy volunteers revealed that this

parameter was close to zero for  xxxd338xxx  (-3.92%), and therefore similar to placebo. conversely, the first-generation agent
hydroxyzine had significantly greater occupancy (+54%).67,68
this confirms that  xxxd338xxx  has relatively limited potential to
cross the blood–brain barrier and interact with cns h1 receptors. based on published data for other agents, it appears that
 xxxd338xxx  has the lowest rate of brain  xxxg1078xxx  occupancy
of all the available antihistamines (table 3).67,69–73 therefore,
it has minimal capacity to cause cns adverse effects.

no qtc prolongation
the cardiac safety profile of  xxxd338xxx  was confirmed in various studies that included concurrent administration of the
cyp450/p-gp inhibitors ketoconazole, erythromycin, and
diltiazem and in detailed qt studies40,74 conducted in accordance with international conference on harmonization (ich)
guidelines. to date,  xxxd338xxx  is the only commercially available antihistamine that has been tested using the stringent ich
e/14 criteria for effects on qt interval. this study showed
no significant effect on qtc interval using these stringent
criteria.42,69 these studies confirmed that standard-dosage
 xxxd338xxx  has a good cardiac safety profile and that uptitration
of the  xxxd338xxx  dose to 220 mg, or administration of the drug
with cyp450 or p-gp inhibitors, does not alter this safety
profile.42,69 in clinical trials,  xxxd338xxx  was not associated with
any clinically relevant qtc interval prolongation.39

 xxxd338xxx  administration in children
the efficacy and safety of  xxxd338xxx  in children aged 12 years
or less, who frequently have allergic disorders, have not yet
been established. for registration of the adult formulation
of  xxxd338xxx , the clinical plan was developed to comply with
the european medicines agency guidelines and therefore
the cut off age is 12 years. however,  xxxd338xxx  has been

interest.

conclusion
currently, there are a number of unmet needs in the management of allergic conditions in asia pacific,14,75 with many
patients still experiencing sedation from the use of older
antihistamines.68 when second-generation h1 antihistamines were introduced in the 1980s, they revolutionized the
treatment of allergic disorders because of a lack of, or only
minimal, sedative potential.39
the proven efficacy and safety profile of  xxxd338xxx , its
low potential for cns impairment when coadministered
with alcohol or for metabolic drug–drug interactions, and no
need for dose adjustments confirm that this compound has
a forerunning place in therapy among second-generation h1
antihistamines in the management of urticaria and allergic
rhinitis, including allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (intermittent
and persistent).
