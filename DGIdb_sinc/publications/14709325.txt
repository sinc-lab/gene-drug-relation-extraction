abstract
in vivo microdialysis was used to monitor the effects of oral aripiprazole and olanzapine on basal extracellular concentrations of
dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), homovanillic acid (hva) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa) in the medial
prefrontal cortex and striatum of conscious, freely moving rats. acute aripiprazole administration did not affect dopamine output, but
produced moderate increases in dopac and hva concentrations, in medial prefrontal cortex or striatum of drug-naı̈ve rats. similarly,
aripiprazole did not affect dopamine output but produced moderate elevations in dopac and hva concentrations in the striatum of chronic
aripiprazole-pretreated rats. olanzapine produced comparatively larger elevations in dopamine, dopac, and hva in both regions, which, in
the striatum, were diminished after chronic olanzapine exposure. aripiprazole reduced extracellular 5-hiaa concentrations in the medial
prefrontal cortex and striatum of drug-naı̈ve rats, but not in chronic aripiprazole-pretreated rats. together, these data provide in vivo evidence
of aripiprazole-induced changes in forebrain dopaminergic and serotonergic function that may reflect its partial agonist activity at presynaptic
dopamine d2 and 5-ht1a receptors and antagonist activity at 5-ht2a receptors.

1. introduction
aripiprazole, 7-{4-[4-(2, 3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy}- xxxd1818xxx )-quinolinone, is a next generation atypical antipsychotic that is active against the
positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, has a
low propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms, causes minimal weight gain and sedation, and produces minimal or no
change in serum prolactin levels or qtc interval prolongation (kane et al., 2002). aripiprazole has a mechanism of
action that differs from all currently marketed typical and
atypical antipsychotics. unlike current antipsychotics,
which act as dopamine receptor antagonists, biochemically,
aripiprazole has been shown to be a potent, partial agonist at
members of the d2 family of dopamine receptors (inoue

et al., 1996; lawler et al., 1999). in vivo, aripiprazole
behaves as a dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonist in rodent
models of dopaminergic hyperactivity (e.g. inhibition of
apomorphine-induced stereotypy) and as a dopamine d2
receptor agonist in a model of dopaminergic hypoactivity
(blockade of increased dopamine synthesis in reserpinetreated rats) (kikuchi et al., 1995). aripiprazole also provokes and blocks yawning behavior in drug-naı̈ve and
apomorphine-treated rats, respectively (fujikawa et al.,
1996). taken together, these in vivo observations are
consistent with in vitro evidence that aripiprazole is a partial
agonist at dopamine d2 receptors (lawler et al., 1999;
burris et al., 2002). in addition, recent in vitro functional
assays have revealed that aripiprazole also interacts with 5ht receptor subtypes. in this respect, aripiprazole displays
potent, partial agonist activity at cloned human (jordan et
al., 2002a) and native rat hippocampal (jordan et al., 2002b)
5-ht1a receptors, and antagonist activity at rat 5-ht2a
receptors (mcquade et al., 2002).

the technique of in vivo microdialysis is commonly
used to investigate drug effects on rat brain extracellular
concentrations of neurotransmitters and their metabolites.
typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs most commonly
produce relatively large increases in dopamine and its
major metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(dopac) and homovanillic acid (hva), in either the
prefrontal cortex or striatum, or in both of these brain
regions (volonte et al., 1997; westerink et al., 1998;
cartmell et al., 2000; rayevsky et al., 1995; watanabe
and hagino, 1999). these antipsychotic-induced increases
in dopamine output and metabolism are in agreement with
the antagonist activities of these drugs at dopamine d2
receptors, and contrast with the inhibitory effects of
dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonists on dopamine output and
metabolism (millan et al., 2000). in comparison, despite in
vitro evidence that aripiprazole binds with high affinity to
dopamine d2 receptors in rat brain (kikuchi et al., 1995;
lawler et al., 1999), in the only in vivo microdialysis
study published to date on the effects of aripiprazole on
forebrain dopaminergic function, aripiprazole produced
changes in dopamine, dopac and hva that are neither
consistent with dopamine  xxxg656xxx  agonist or antagonist activity. rather, acute administration of aripiprazole
slightly inhibited dopamine output and moderately stimulated dopac and hva accumulation in rat prefrontal
cortex and striatum (semba et al., 1995), an overall profile
that is distinct amongst all other antipsychotic drugs and
which may represent a partial agonist activity of aripiprazole at dopamine d2 receptors. the present study used in
vivo microdialysis to confirm and extend upon the work
of semba et al. by examining the effects of aripiprazole on
basal extracellular concentrations of dopamine, dopac,
hva and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa), a major
metabolite of 5-ht that may be considered as an index of
serotonergic neuronal activity (stenfors et al., 1999).
concentrations were assessed in the medial prefrontal
cortex and striatum of conscious, unrestrained rats. measurements of 5-hiaa were included in this study to
provide in vivo evidence that aripiprazole is a partial
agonist at 5-ht1a receptors. aripiprazole was also studied
for its effects on striatal dopamine, dopac, hva and 5hiaa in rats receiving chronic aripiprazole treatment, to
determine whether potential changes in dopaminergic or
serotonergic sensitivity develop after repeated aripiprazole
exposure.

and water. all animals were adapted to the laboratory for
14 days prior to surgery, at which time they weighed 270–
330 g. the experimental protocol was approved and conducted in accordance with otsuka america pharmaceutical’s institutional animal care and use committee
(iacuc).
2.2. in vivo microdialysis
rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (65 mg/kg,
i.p.) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame (stoelting, wood
dale, il). a cma-11 guide cannula (cma-microdialysis,
acton, ma) was stereotaxically implanted into the dorsal
medial prefrontal cortex or central striatum. two days after
cannulation, a microdialysis probe (cma-12, 4 mm tip
length) was inserted into the guide cannula so that its tip
terminated in either the medial prefrontal cortex (ap= + 3.2
mm, lat = 0.6 mm, dv = 5.3 mm from dura) or
striatum (ap= + 1.2 mm, lat = 3.0 mm, dv = 7.2
mm from dura) using coordinates according to the atlas of
paxinos and watson (1998). each probe was continuously
perfused at 1 al/min with sterile artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(acsf) (1.2 mm na2hpo4, 0.27 mm nah2po4, 140 mm
nacl, 3 mm kcl, 2.5 mm cacl2, 7.2 mm glucose, ph
7.29) using a cma-102 microinfusion pump. animals were
individually housed for the duration of the experiment in a
raturnr animal system (bas, west lafayette, in) and
microdialysate samples were collected at 30 min intervals
(cma-142 microfraction collector) into silanized microvials
containing 5 al of 0.1n hcl to reduce oxidation of monoamines. vehicle and drug treatments were administered 5
h after microdialysis probe implantation and microdialysate
sampling continued for 3 h thereafter. a dissecting microscope was used to verify correct microdialysis probe placement at the end of each experiment.
2.3. drug treatments
all vehicle and drug treatments were administered by
oral gavage using a 5 ml/kg dose volume. rats received
either an acute administration of vehicle, aripiprazole (2, 10
and 40 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1, 10 and 20 mg/kg) or were
administered chronically with vehicle, aripiprazole (10 and
40 mg/kg) or olanzapine (20 mg/kg) daily for 21 consecutive days.
2.4. biochemical conditions

2. methods
2.1. animals and surgery
male sprague – dawley rats (charles river laboratories,
raleigh, nc) were housed under conditions of controlled
temperature (23 f 1 jc) and lighting (12-h light – dark
cycle, lights on at 0700 h), with unlimited access to food

an isocratic, high-performance liquid chromatography –
electrochemical detection (hplc –ecd) assay was used to
simultaneously quantitate dopamine, dopac, 5-hiaa and
hva in single 30-al samples of microdialysate. a commercial mobile phase (md-tm, esa, chelmsford, ma), containing 75 mm nah2po4, 1.7 mm 1-octanesulfonic acid
sodium salt, 25 am edta and 10% acetonitrile (adjusted to
ph 3.0 with phosphoric acid), was pumped at 0.4 ml/min

through an esa md-150 rp c-18 (150  4.6 mm, 3 am
ods) column. analyte detection was performed using an
esa coulochem ii multi-electrode detector equipped with
a 5014b microdialysis cell (first electrode set at 275 mv,
second electrode at 250 mv; guard cell = 500 mv). online
data capture was performed using waters millennium software version 3.20 for hplc.

microdialysates collected 21 h after rats were administered
their penultimate daily exposure to drug or vehicle. the
present hplc – ecd system was capable of measuring an
external standard of 5-ht dissolved in acsf, with a lower
limit of quantitation of 2.5 pg on column, although 5-ht
was unable to be reliably detected in microdialysate samples
and was therefore excluded from our analysis.

2.5. statistics

3.1. acute effects of aripiprazole in the medial prefrontal
cortex

statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05) (treatment  time) between vehicle and drug treatment effects
on post-treatment extracellular concentrations of dopamine,
dopac, hva and 5-hiaa in the medial prefrontal cortex
and striatum were established by repeated measures analysis
of variance. statistically significant differences between
vehicle and individual drug dose effects on cortical and
striatal dopamine, dopac, hva and 5-hiaa were revealed
by a post hoc dunnett’s multiple comparison test (dose 
time). all statistical analyses were performed using complete post-dose microdialysate data sets collected 30 –180
min post-dose.

acute administration of aripiprazole did not alter extracellular dopamine concentrations in the medial prefrontal
cortex (fig. 1a). however, aripiprazole induced significant
increases in medial prefrontal cortex dopac ( p < 0.001;
f = 9.65) and hva ( p < 0.01; f = 6.0) concentrations that
were accompanied by a significant inhibition of medial
prefrontal cortex 5-hiaa ( p < 0.0001; f = 21.3). post hoc
analysis revealed that these effects on dopac and hva
were significant at the 10 and 40 mg/kg doses of aripiprazole (fig. 1b,c), whereas a significant reduction in 5-hiaa
was only produced at a dose of 40 mg/kg (fig. 1d).

2.6. drugs

3.2. acute effects of aripiprazole in the striatum

aripiprazole and olanzapine were synthesized by otsuka
pharmaceutical (tokushima, japan). tragacanth gum and
hva were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). dopamine, 5-hiaa and dopac were purchased from rbi
(natick, ma). artificial csf (acsf) was filtered (0.2 am)
prior to use. all drugs were suspended in a 0.5% (w/v)
tragacanth gum-distilled water vehicle.

no statistically significant differences could be detected
between the effects of individual doses of aripiprazole and
vehicle upon striatal extracellular dopamine concentrations
(fig. 2a). aripiprazole treatment significantly elevated
extracellular levels of dopac ( p = 0.003; f = 7.4) in the
striatum, this effect being significantly different from vehicle at the 10 mg/kg dose only (fig. 2b). aripiprazole
treatment also produced a significant rise in extracellular
levels of hva ( p = 0.002; f = 8.1) that differed significantly from vehicle at the 10 and 40 mg/kg doses (fig. 2c).
acute administration of aripiprazole significantly inhibited
striatal extracellular 5-hiaa ( p < 0.0001; f = 17.8) concentrations and this effect was significant at all doses tested
(fig. 2d).

3. results
mean basal concentrations of dopamine, dopac, hva
and 5-hiaa were each significantly higher in microdialysates collected from the striatum than from the medial
prefrontal cortex in naı̈ve animals (table 1; p < 0.001,
mann –whitney rank sum test). chronic administration of
either aripiprazole or olanzapine did not produce a significant ( p>0.05, unpaired t-test) change in mean basal concentrations of dopamine, dopac, hva and 5-hiaa
compared with mean basal concentrations of these neurochemicals in rats chronically administered vehicle (table 2).
these mean basal concentrations were calculated from

3.3. acute effects of olanzapine in the medial prefrontal
cortex
acute administration of olanzapine produced a significant ( p < 0.0001; f = 19.8) increase in basal dopamine

mean basal concentrations of da, dopac, hva and 5-hiaa did not differ significantly ( p>0.05, unpaired t-test) between vehicle and drug treatment groups.

exposure to olanzapine also stimulated large dose-dependent
increases in extracellular concentrations of dopac ( p <
0.0001; f = 36.8; significant  xxxd1891xxx  and 20 mg/kg) and hva
( p = 0.0002; f = 12.7; significant at 1, 10 and 20 mg/kg)
(fig. 3b,c). in contrast, no significant changes in cortical
5-hiaa ( p < 0.10; f = 2.5) concentrations were detected
after acute administration of olanzapine (fig. 3d).
3.4. acute effects of olanzapine in the striatum
acute administration of olanzapine considerably elevated
striatal extracellular dopamine concentrations ( p < 0.0001;
f = 29.8) and this effect was significant at the 10 and 20 mg/
kg doses (fig. 4a). olanzapine also produced large dosedependent increases in concentrations of striatal dopac
( p < 0.0001; f = 23.7; fig. 4b) and hva ( p = 0.0006;
f = 10.5; fig. 4c) that were significant at all doses tested.

these effects of olanzapine were accompanied by a small
decrease in striatal 5-hiaa accumulation ( p < 0.0001;
f = 18.6), although this effect was only significant at the
lowest dose (1 mg/kg) tested (fig. 4d).
3.5. chronic effects of aripiprazole in the striatum
treatment with vehicle alone reduced extracellular dopamine in microdialysates collected from the striatum of rats
administered chronically with vehicle (fig. 5a). aripiprazole produced a comparatively weaker inhibitory effect on
striatal dopamine in the rats that had been administered
chronically with aripiprazole ( p = 0.01; f = 14.9; no significant difference between each dose of aripiprazole and
vehicle). in addition to this, aripiprazole produced increases
in extracellular dopac ( p = 0.005; f = 9.2; fig. 5b) and
hva ( p = 0.04; f = 4.5; fig. 5c) concentrations in striatal

3.6. chronic effects of olanzapine in the striatum
at the only dose tested (20 mg/kg), olanzapine produced
significant increases in striatal dopamine, dopac, hva
and 5-hiaa concentrations in microdialysate samples collected from rats that had been treated chronically with
olanzapine (fig. 5a –d).

4. discussion
the technique of in vivo brain microdialysis was used to
monitor the effects of orally administered aripiprazole and
olanzapine on basal extracellular concentrations of dopamine, dopac, hva and 5-hiaa in the medial prefrontal
cortex and striatum of conscious, freely moving rats. acute
administration of aripiprazole did not affect dopamine
output in either the medial prefrontal cortex or striatum of
drug-naı̈ve rats. in a previous microdialysis study when
aripiprazole was administered by intraperitoneal injection,
reductions in dopamine output in the medial prefrontal
cortex and striatum were observed in drug-naı̈ve rats
(semba et al., 1995). the present lack of effect of aripiprazole on forebrain dopamine output may be related to
pharmacokinetic differences resulting from the administration of aripiprazole by the oral rather than the intraperitoneal
route. nevertheless, both of these studies are in agreement
in that they did not detect increases in frontocortical
dopamine in response to aripiprazole. based upon the
effectiveness of aripiprazole against the negative symptoms
and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia (kane et al., 2002;
carson et al., 2002), these data challenge the view that
atypical antipsychotic drugs improve these symptoms of
schizophrenia by selectively increasing cortical dopamine
release. in addition, and in accordance with the findings of
semba et al., aripiprazole did produce moderate increases in
dopac and hva concentrations in the medial prefrontal
cortex and striatum of drug-naı̈ve rats. we also observed a
similar effect of aripiprazole in the striatum of rats that were
chronically treated with aripiprazole that might indicate that
long-term exposure to aripiprazole might not be expected to
induce tolerance in striatal dopaminergic metabolism. in
contrast with aripiprazole, acute administration with olanzapine produced relatively large dose-dependent increases in
extracellular concentrations of dopamine, dopac and hva
in both the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum, and these
effects of olanzapine on striatal dopamine and dopac
concentrations were diminished in rats chronically treated
with olanzapine. previous microdialysis studies have demonstrated similar effects of olanzapine on these biochemical
indices of forebrain dopaminergic function, which have
been attributed to the activity of olanzapine as an antagonist
at presynaptic dopamine d2 receptors (volonte et al., 1997;
li et al., 1998; westerink et al., 1998). aripiprazole also
dose-dependently reduced extracellular 5-hiaa concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum of drug-

51

naı̈ve rats in the current study. in contrast, aripiprazole had
no effect on extracellular concentrations of this metabolite
of 5-ht in the striatum of rats that had been chronically
treated with aripiprazole, suggesting that chronic exposure
to aripiprazole may induce a rapid functional desensitization
of somatodendritic 5-ht1a receptors, which has previously
been demonstrated for  xxxg1108xxx  agonists (kennett et
al., 1987; fuller and perry, 1989). aripiprazole has been
shown to behave as a potent, partial agonist at rat hippocampal 5-ht1a receptors (jordan et al., 2002b) and cloned
human 5-ht1a receptors (jordan et al., 2002a). in vivo
electrophysiological experiments have also shown that aripiprazole dose-dependently inhibits the activity of 5-htcontaining neurons in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus (sharp et
al., personal communication), an effect also produced by the
 xxxg1108xxx  partial agonist buspirone (millan et al.,
1992). collectively, these and the present data suggest that
aripiprazole activates presynaptic 5-ht1a receptors to reduce either the biosynthesis or release of 5-ht that in turn
would account for the inhibitory effects of aripiprazole on
forebrain extracellular 5-hiaa concentrations. further
microdialysis studies are required to confirm whether aripiprazole inhibits forebrain 5-ht output and whether the
effects of aripiprazole on forebrain serotonergic function
are specifically mediated by 5-ht1a receptors, as would be
determined by their sensitivity to the  xxxg1108xxx 
selective antagonist n-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide (way100635). in addition, in vitro experiments should also be
performed to test the alternative possibility that aripiprazole
may interfere with the enzymatic processes involved in the
biosynthesis or metabolism of 5-ht.
initial pharmacological evidence identified aripiprazole
as a mixed agonist/antagonist at pre- and postsynaptic
dopamine d2 receptors, respectively (kikuchi et al., 1995),
as previously also demonstrated for 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-nn-propylpiperidine (3-ppp), a partial agonist at dopamine d2
receptors (clark et al., 1985). additional data have since
accumulated to demonstrate that aripiprazole is also a partial
agonist at dopamine d2 receptors (fujikawa et al., 1996;
inoue et al., 1996; lawler et al., 1999). as a dopamine d2
receptor partial agonist, aripiprazole could be expected to act
as a functional agonist at presynaptic dopamine d2 receptors,
which have receptor reserve and low endogenous dopamine
tone, and as a functional antagonist at post-synaptic dopamine d2 receptors, which have little or no receptor reserve
and a relatively high endogenous dopamine tone (meller et
al., 1987; yokoo et al., 1988). based on this model, a partial
agonist activity of aripiprazole at presynaptic dopamine d2
receptors could account for its ability to produce no change
in dopamine while moderately increasing dopac and hva
in both the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum. these
effects of aripiprazole are intermediate between the relatively
large stimulatory and inhibitory effects typically produced
by dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonist and agonist drugs,
respectively, upon forebrain dopamine and its metabolites

(ferre and artigas, 1995; cartmell et al., 2000; rayevsky et
al., 1995; millan et al., 2000). indeed, a close inverse
correlation exists between the relative intrinsic activity of
drugs at dopamine d2 receptors and their corresponding
effects on striatal extracellular hva concentrations (lahti
et al., 1992), and based upon this relationship aripiprazole
would be predicted to behave as a partial agonist at dopamine
d2 receptors with a low relative intrinsic activity. alternatively, the current effects of aripiprazole on forebrain dopaminergic function may be explained by its combined activity
as a partial agonist at dopamine d2 receptors, a partial
agonist at 5-ht1a receptors, and an antagonist at 5-ht2a
receptors. in a manner similar to that believed to account for
the ability of other partial  xxxg1108xxx  agonist drugs to
produce increases in striatal dopac and hva (protais et al.,
1998; nomikos et al., 1992; ballarin et al., 1994; meltzer,
1999; millan et al., 2000), aripiprazole might activate  xxxg1108xxx  autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus to lower the
level of serotonergic tone on 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c heteroreceptors, which respectively exert excitatory and indirect
inhibitory effects on forebrain dopaminergic function. aripiprazole might also regulate dopaminergic metabolism by
acting directly as a competitive antagonist at 5-ht2a heteroreceptors. other antipsychotic drugs have been shown to
regulate cortical dopamine release via their combined antagonistic activities at dopamine d2 and 5-ht2a receptors
(ichikawa et al., 2001). in addition, aripiprazole has been
recently reported to behave as a partial agonist at dopamine
d3 receptors (shapiro et al., 2003), suggesting the present
effects of aripiprazole might partly be mediated through
dopamine d3 autoreceptors. however, it is uncertain as to
whether dopaminergic inhibitory autoreceptors are exclusively of the d2 or d3 subtype, or even whether dopamine d3
receptors primarily regulate dopamine release rather than
turnover (millan et al., 2000). while the present study clearly
demonstrates that the effects of aripiprazole on dopaminergic
metabolites are clearly distinct from those of all other
antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine (li et al., 1998),
additional experiments, using dopamine d2, d3 and 5-ht1a,
 xxxg1113xxx  selective compounds, are however warranted to interpret whether this unique profile of aripiprazole
is representative of its independent or collective activity at
dopamine d2, d3 or 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a receptors, all of which
appear to have the capacity to directly or indirectly regulate
dopaminergic neuronal function.
in the present study, administration of vehicle reduced
basal striatal dopamine output in microdialysates collected
from rats that had been chronically administered with
vehicle. the absence of a similar response in drug-naı̈ve
rats suggests this effect might represent an adaptive response of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system to the
effects of repeated oral gavage stress. this possible stress
effect was less prominent when aripiprazole was administered to rats that had been chronically exposed to aripiprazole. these possible effects of oral gavage stress require
further investigation, although they are not too surprising as

other acute stressors have been shown to modify the
sensitivity of the dopaminergic system to subsequent stress
or pharmacological challenge (fdez espejo and gil, 1997;
pani et al., 2000; pacchioni et al., 2002).
in summary, aripiprazole produced moderate increases in
basal dopac and hva concentrations in the medial
prefrontal cortex and striatum of rats that were drug-naı̈ve
and chronically exposed to aripiprazole. these modest
effects on forebrain dopaminergic metabolism, and the lack
of effect of individual aripiprazole doses on cortical and
striatal dopamine output may reflect a partial agonist activity of aripiprazole at presynaptic dopamine d2 receptors.
partial agonist activity of aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors
could indirectly contribute to these effects on forebrain
dopaminergic function and to its suppression of striatal 5hiaa in drug-naı̈ve rats but not in rats chronically treated
with aripiprazole. the results of the present study, together
with other data demonstrating that aripiprazole is a partial
agonist at dopamine d2 receptors, a partial agonist at  xxxg1108xxx  receptors, and an antagonist at 5-ht2a receptors,
suggest that aripiprazole may be best described as a dopamine – serotonin system stabilizer representing the first
member of a new generation of antipsychotic drugs (grady
et al., 2003). this preclinical profile is supportive of the
clinical efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia, including activity against both positive and negative symptoms with minimal risk of side effects such as
extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation or elevated prolactin
levels (carson et al., 2002; kane et al., 2002). further
microdialysis studies, using receptor-selective compounds,
are required to investigate the role(s) played by individual
subtypes of dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors in
mediating the effects of aripiprazole on forebrain dopaminergic and serotonergic function.
