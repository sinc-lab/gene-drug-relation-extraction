abstract objectives: to investigate the in vitro effects of detergent sclerosants on antithrombotic pathways.
materials and methods: proteins c, s and antithrombin (at) were assayed in normal plasma
treated with increasing concentrations of  xxxd3221xxx  (sts) and polidocanol
(pol).  xxxg1847xxx  (apc) was investigated by mixing normal plasmas with sclerosants
and testing with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) and dilute russell’s viper
venom time in the presence and absence of apc. the effect on  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ), heparin and
enoxaparin was investigated using chromogenic anti- xxxg741xxx  and aptt methods.
results: high concentration (>0.6%) sts significantly destroyed proteins c, s and at whereas
pol only caused a mild reduction in pc and at and a moderate (60%) reduction in ps levels.
sts potentiated the anticoagulant effect of apc while pol increased apc resistance. sts
mimicked at and demonstrated significant anti-xa and anti-iia activity. sts demonstrated
a similar anticoagulant profile to heparin but was 1000 weaker. it also significantly potentiated the anticoagulant effect of heparin while pol had less effect.
conclusion: sts and pol demonstrated quite distinct and sometimes opposite effects on the
antithrombotic mechanisms assayed. these effects were concentration-dependent and in
general, sts had the greatest effect on antithrombotic proteins.

sclerosants and antithrombotic mechanisms
coagulation inhibitors such as protein c (pc),  xxxg1850xxx  (ps),
antithrombin (at) and a number of endothelial surface
membrane components such as heparinoids play a critical
role in limiting the process of thrombus formation.1 these
antithrombotic proteins are dependent on the integrity of
the endothelium surrounding the focus of injury.2,3
by inducing vessel wall injury, detergent sclerosants might
be expected to initiate the same coagulation pathways that
ultimately lead to the generation of thrombin and formation
of a fibrin clot. given the detergent nature of these agents,
they might also be expected to destroy the endothelialdependent antithrombotic proteins and induce an overall
prothrombotic state. however, as previously demonstrated
by the authors, the interaction of these agents with blood
components is quite complex and sts in particular destroys
a number of clotting factors and demonstrates anticoagulant
activity at high concentrations.4,5
in this study, we investigated the effect of detergent
sclerosants on plasma coagulation inhibitors pc, ps and at
and studied their interaction with  xxxg1847xxx 
(apc), heparin, enoxaparin and  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ).

nsw, australia). human  xxxg1847xxx  (apc) was
acquired from hyphen biomed (neuville sur oise, france).
clotting tests were carried out on an acl300r (instrumentation laboratory, italy). the microplate reader used was
manufactured by titertek mcc, finland.

sample preparations
freeze dried samples were prepared by using normal plasma
spiked with sts and pol in siliconised glass vials, frozen
quickly at 50  c and then freeze dried under vacuum over
a period of 24 h. prior to testing, each vial was reconstituted
with 2 ml of water. the apc resistant plasma was prepared
using 3% alumina adsorbed porcine plasma (haematex
research laboratory) and 97% human plasma. samples were
processed immediately after preparation and reconstitution
to minimise time-dependent variations in results.

effect on protein c

materials and methods

pc was measured by the berichrom protein c assay (dade
behring, marburg, germany) which measures functionally
active protein c, using a chromogenic substrate.

sample collection

effect on  xxxg1850xxx 

fresh frozen normal plasma used for these studies was
derived from donor blood deemed unsuitable for clinical
indications. this was obtained from the australian red
cross blood transfusion service, sydney.

the functional (clotting) assays of ps measure the activity
of free ps, while the antigenic assays can measure free ps,
bound ps or total ps.6 we measured the antigenic levels of
free ps by the sta-liatest free  xxxg1850xxx  assay (diagnostica stago, asnieres, france); an immuno-turbidimetric
method utilising latex microparticles coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for free ps.

sclerosants and other compounds
sts was obtained as  xxxd3221xxx  3% from australian medical and
scientific limited (chatswood, nsw, australia).  xxxd3221xxx 
excipients include benzyl alcohol, dibasic sodium phosphate,
monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium hydroxide and
water for injection. pol was obtained as aethoxysklerol 3%
from chemische fabrik kreussler & co (gmbh, wiesbaden,
germany). aethoxysklerol excipients include ethanol, sodium
phosphate-dibasic dihydrate, potassium phosphate monobasic and water for injection. equivalent products in other
countries include  xxxd3221xxx  (bionichepharma, usa; sodium
tetradecyl sulphate, excipients include benzyl alcohol,
dibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate and/
or sodium hydroxide and water for injection) and sclerovein
(resinag ag, switzerland; polidocanol, excipients include
ethanol and chlorobutanolumhemihydricum). although these
products and their excipients are quite similar, the results of
this study are only applicable to the drugs tested and other
products should be assessed independently.
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) was obtained from bovogen
(melbourne, victoria, australia). unfractionated heparin was
obtained from astra zeneca (1000 iu/ml clinical grade, north
ryde, nsw, australia).  xxxd1997xxx  (enoxaparin) was obtained
from sanofi-aventis (macquarie park, nsw, australia). human
 xxxg741xxx  was obtained from enzyme research lab (in, usa)
and chromogenic substrate for  xxxg741xxx  (acetyl-d-cha-gly-argpna) was obtained from pentapharm (basel, switzerland).
platelin, intrinsin ls, intrinsin lr and drvvt-lr reagents
were donated by haematex research laboratory (hornsby,

effect on antithrombin
at was measured by the sta-stachrome  xxxg2056xxx  assay
(diagnostica stago) which measures functionally active at,
using a chromogenic substrate in freeze dried samples
containing increasing concentrations of sclerosants. this
method involves mixing the sample with excess thrombin
(at inactivates thrombin) in a heparin buffer and then
measuring the residual thrombin activity.
to investigate the apparent increase in at activity
induced by high concentration sts, freeze dried samples
containing 1.5% sts and 10% bsa (containing no plasma),
1.5% sts and hydrolysed gelatine (containing no plasma) and
1.5% sts in normal plasma were compared for at activity.
bsa is known to completely neutralise sts5 and hence any
apparent at activity due to sts should be inhibited by
albumin whereas any apparent at activity in samples containing sts and gelatine but no plasma, would be due to the
direct effect of sts on the thrombin used in this assay. these
were compared with control plasma containing 1.5% sts.

aptt-based assays
to determine the effects of sclerosants on apc, normal
plasma containing increasing levels of both sclerosants was

tested with and without apc present in calcium chloride and
aptt was measured. a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml of apc
was found to be necessary to prolong the aptt of normal
plasma significantly, thus demonstrating apc responsiveness. the aptt reagent used was mainly intrinsin ls.

protein c (%)

dilute russell’s viper venom (drvvt)-based assays
to evaluate the effect of sclerosants on apc resistance
(apcr) in normal and abnormal plasma more specifically,
apc resistant plasma was prepared by using 3% porcine
plasma/97% human plasma. porcine factor v (fv) is resistant to cleavage by human apc. normal and apc resistant
plasmas containing 0.15e0.25% sclerosants were premixed
with apc for 3 min, and then mixed with drvvt-lr reagent
and timed to clotting endpoints. ratios of clotting times
with apc to those without apc were derived. a ratio of 1.6
or less was defined as abnormal.

comparison with anticoagulant activity of heparin
this study was done to compare the anticoagulant activity
and dose response curve of heparin with detergent sclerosants. small volumes of heparin (10 u/ml stock solution)
or sclerosants were added to 0.3 ml volumes of normal
citrated plasma and tested for aptt at 20  c.

interaction with heparin
to assess the effect of sclerosants on the anticoagulant
properties of heparin, both drugs at various dilutions were
added to normal plasma with or without heparin and aptt
was measured. the aptt reagent used was platelin. a range
of heparin concentrations was selected to derive the
heparin sensitivity curve.7,8

normal plasma samples containing varying concentrations of
sts or pol and none or 0.2 iu/ml of unfractionated heparin
or enoxaparin (concentrations similar to those used therapeutically) were incubated with an equal volume (0.05 ml) of
 xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ) and then tested with chromogenic substrate
for  xxxg741xxx  activity. residual  xxxg741xxx  activity was assessed from
absorbance readings at 414 nm on a microplate reader. as
previously reported by the authors, there is an increase in
turbidity with concentrations of sts above 0.3% due to
precipitation of complexes between  xxxg175xxx  and
fibrinogen.4 the artefactual effect of turbidity on the optical
density was partially reduced by measuring the optical density
at a number of time points and subtracting the artefact.

down to 60%. at levels appeared to rise at sts concentrations above 0.6% (fig. 3). to investigate this apparent rise,
samples containing 1.5% sts and bsa or hydrolysed gelatine
(but no plasma) were tested in this system. sample containing bsa displayed no at activity due to neutralisation of
sts by bsa. samples containing hydrolysed gelatine and sts
produced further at activity indicating this activity to be
due to the direct effect of sts on thrombin.

sts prolonged aptt potentiating the anticoagulant activity
of apc, whereas pol had the opposite effect (fig. 4a,b).
pol at concentrations of 0.1% and above increased apcr
(i.e. reduced apcr ratio) whereas sts reduced apcr (i.e.
increased apcr ratio) (fig. 5).

direct effect of sts on thrombin mimicking the action of at. pol
caused a 20% reduction in at activity (n z 3; ,, sts; , pol).

above 0.1% rapidly decreased  xxxg741xxx  activity to low levels
similar to those achieved by heparin. high concentration sts
paradoxically demonstrated an increase in optical density
in this system when measuring  xxxg741xxx  chromogenic activity.
this is due to precipitation of  xxxg175xxx  and sts
complexes which generates turbidity.4 sts destroyed at at
concentrations above 0.3% hence the lack of difference
between samples with and without heparin or enoxaparin.
increasing levels of pol reduced the activity of  xxxg741xxx 
slightly in normal plasma and plasmas containing heparin or
enoxaparin (results not shown). however the difference
between the normal plasma and the heparin-containing
plasmas was maintained even at high pol levels indicating no
interference by pol in heparin-mediated inhibition of  xxxg741xxx .

endothelial surface membrane components such as heparinoids operate to maintain the patency of blood vessels
and the fluidity of the circulating blood. the ultimate aim
of sclerotherapy is to cause sclerosis of incompetent
superficial veins and perforators while having a negligible
effect on the underlying deep veins. hence the ideal sclerosant should have minimal disruptive effects on the

deep veins. the aim of this study was to investigate the in
vitro effects of the commonly used detergent sclerosants,
sts and pol, on plasma coagulation inhibitors pc, ps and
at. we also examined the interaction of these drugs with
therapeutic anticoagulants heparin and enoxaparin. clinicians should note that the sclerosant concentrations
reported here are the final active concentrations. once
injected, the sclerosant undergoes dilution and neutralisation by blood components and the final intravascular
concentration will not necessarily be the same as the initial
concentration.5
in this study, sts destroyed most antithrombotic
proteins at high concentrations while pol had less
destructive effects (table 1, fig. 7a,b). this is possibly due
to denaturation and unfolding of the protein molecules as
expected of potent detergents such as sts.9 sts at
concentrations higher than 0.6% significantly destroyed pc
whereas pol caused a 20% reduction. both agents reduced
ps levels quite significantly. only 40% of ps circulating in
plasma is free and the rest is bound to  xxxg284xxx  binding protein
(c4bp) with no apc cofactor activity.6,10 high concentration
pol caused a 60% reduction in free ps levels while sts
completely destroyed this protein. ps has lipid and steroid
binding domains and enhances the binding of apc to
phospholipid membranes.11e13 the destructive effect of
detergent sclerosants on ps could be due to their interaction with the lipid binding domain of ps, release of proteases from activated platelets14 or direct denaturation of
the protein molecule.
sclerotherapy with both sts and pol is associated with
necrosis presenting with a stellate or reticulate pattern.15
venoarteriolar reflex (var) vasospasm of accompanying
arterioles,16 and entry of sludge5 or direct entry of sclerosants from the injected veins into these arterial vessels
via open av shunts,17,18 have been proposed as mechanisms
underlying this complication. var sympathetic reflex due to
rapid dilation of the target vein can lead to vasospasm of
the associated arterioles. high pressure, high volume and
rapid injection of the sclerosant can trigger this sympathetic reflex. var vasospasm followed by a local deficiency
of proteins c and s induced by both sts and pol may
contribute to the thrombotic occlusion of these arterial
vessels leading to skin and tissue necrosis. two other
conditions with a similar pattern of ulceration, warfarin
necrosis and calciphylaxis, also present with underlying pc
or s deficiency.19,20
in this study, sts destroyed at almost completely at
concentrations above 0.3% but the apparent activity of at
was increased by sts concentrations above 0.6%. we
postulated this to be due to the inhibitory effect of sts on
thrombin as seen by prolongation of thrombin time.4 the
apparent rise in at activity at higher sts levels was
completely reversed by adding albumin (which binds sts)
but not by hydrolysed gelatine (which does not bind sts).
hence, high concentration sts mimicked the antithrombotic activity of at by direct inhibition of thrombin.
pol only caused a mild reduction in at levels.
sts demonstrated antithrombotic activity by significantly increasing the sensitivity of fva to the proteolytic
effect of apc. high concentration sts induces a true deficiency of fv, which is a precursor to fva, the main target of
apc.4 also rapid inactivation of fva by apc requires

negatively charged phospholipid membrane surfaces containing  xxxd1857xxx .21 this phospholipid surface is
normally provided by activated platelets, platelet derived
microparticles (pdmp) and damaged endothelial cells.22
low concentration sts activates platelets and releases
pdmp while higher concentrations would destroy platelets,
pdmp, endothelial cells and other cell membranes providing
the required phospholipid surfaces.4,5
pol by contrast demonstrated prothrombotic activity by
increasing apc resistance, as evident by both aptt and
drvvt assays. this effect was concentration-dependent
and higher concentrations of pol showed further inhibition
of apc activity. pol, a non-ionic detergent, possibly binds
to the phospholipid binding site of fva which would reduce
the sensitivity of fva to apc.
we compared the anticoagulant effect of the detergent
sclerosants with that of heparin. similar to heparin, sts
inhibited both thrombin and  xxxg741xxx  while pol did not
demonstrate a significant anticoagulant profile. sts was
about 1000 weaker than heparin on a direct concentration
basis but produced a similar dose response curve to heparin
although less linear. although heparin and sts appear to
have similar anticoagulant characteristics, they achieve
this activity through different mechanisms. heparin
requires at to function whereas the anticoagulant activity
of sts is due to direct destruction of clotting factors,
platelets and pdmp and is independent of at. in a later
experiment, sts potentiated the anticoagulant effect of
heparin whereas pol had a mild effect. sts works synergistically with heparin due to its direct inhibition of
thrombin and  xxxg741xxx .
we have previously shown a reduction in fx levels by
sts.4 here we investigated the effect of sts on  xxxg741xxx , the
active form of fx. sts reduced  xxxg741xxx  activity consistent with
the anticoagulant effect of sts on clotting tests.4 by

contrast, pol only slightly reduced  xxxg741xxx  activity.  xxxg741xxx  usually
occurs as part of the  xxxg741xxx  complex with fva.
this complex assembles on negatively charged phospholipid
membranes in the presence of calcium ions and catalyses
the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. based on our
present and previous studies, sts interferes with thrombin
generation by its direct inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  and fva.4 the antixa activity of sts is not due to potentiation of at as in this
study sts at high concentrations destroyed at.
our present finding that high concentration sts
destroyed pc, ps and at may appear contradictory to our
previous reports of the anticoagulant activity of this agent
in the same concentration range.4 in this study, sts in the
active concentration range of 0.1e0.3% showed very little
destructive effect on natural antithrombotic proteins but
these low concentrations activate the coagulation cascade
as previously shown by the authors.4 by contrast, if the final
active concentration of sts, after mixing with blood and
neutralisation, stays at 0.6% or higher, the agent will
effectively destroy key clotting factors, platelets and
pdmp4 and, as demonstrated in this study, most natural
antithrombotic proteins. although these pro- and antithrombotic effects may appear to neutralise each other, high
concentration sts in this study achieved a net anticoagulant profile, independent of natural antithrombotic pathways, as evident by its anti-xa, anti-iia, and anti-va
activity. these findings further confirm our previous report
of significant prolongation of all clotting times by high
concentration sts.4
similarly, pol in the active concentration range of 0.2e
0.4% demonstrates procoagulant activity as evident by
platelet activation, release of pdmp and shortening of
clotting times.4 high concentration pol (>0.6%) does not
significantly prolong most clotting times and in this study
even demonstrated some prothrombotic activity by

mechanisms. the effect demonstrated is at the point of entry of the sclerosant into the blood vessel and the immediate adjacent
area. high concentration sts (a) destroys platelets and the key clotting factors and hence aborts the coagulation cascade.
thrombin normally activates the antithrombotic pathway, but by destroying thrombin, pc, ps and at, high concentration sts also
effectively interrupts the natural antithrombotic pathways. high concentration sts demonstrates potent anti-xa, anti-iia and antiva activity, potentiating the anticoagulant effect of apc. pol (b) has a less disruptive effect on natural antithrombotic proteins but
increases apc resistance (tf,  xxxg748xxx ;  xxxg2266xxx ,  xxxg2266xxx ; pl, phospholipid; fvii,  xxxg750xxx ; pt,

sclerosants and antithrombotic mechanisms
increasing apc resistance, moderate reductions in ps levels
and mild reductions in pc and at.
the clinical relevance of these findings requires further
investigation in the context of the sclerosant’s concentration and its site of action. pc, ps, at and most other
antithrombotic proteins are dependent on the integrity of
the endothelial lining away from the primary focus of injury
(fig. 7a,b). activation of pc by thrombinethrombomodulin
complex and the binding of pc to the endothelial cell pc
receptor ( xxxg1848xxx ) require an intact endothelial cell
membrane.23,24 the final effect of the sclerosant on the
target vessel and its antithrombotic mechanisms will depend
on the degree of damage to the endothelium, the subsequent vasospasm and vessel wall approximation and the final
active intravascular concentration of the sclerosant. clinically, sclerosants are observed to enter the deep veins via
perforators or junctions. for high concentration sts to exert
an antithrombotic effect on the deep veins, it will have to
avoid sclerosing the exposed segment which means avoiding
contact with the vascular wall and its endothelial lining. this
is unlikely, however, as it requires small volumes of the high
concentration liquid agent to enter the deep veins via
laminar flow. immediate vessel wall approximation due to
vasospasm, turbulent flow due to fast delivery, rapid entry
of large volumes of the liquid agent as well as the use of the
foam format of the sclerosant will increase the exposure of
the detergent to the vascular wall causing endothelial cell
lysis which may lead to sclerotic occlusion of the exposed
segment of the deep vein. consistently, deep vein occlusion
has been reported to be more common in association with
foam sclerosants than liquid especially when high volumes of
foam have been used.25 therefore, the antithrombotic
activity of high concentration sts may not be clinically
useful as the same high concentrations, given adequate
vessel wall approximation, would cause partial or full sclerosis of the exposed vein segment.
this study had a number of limitations. firstly, due to its
in vitro nature, its clinical relevance needs to be established
by in vivo studies. although sts demonstrated more anticoagulant properties in vitro, it does not necessarily make
this drug safer than pol and the comparative incidence of
post-treatment dvt needs to be derived from clinical
studies. also, although we studied a number of key antithrombotic proteins, further work is required to investigate
the interaction of these agents with other members of the
antithrombotic pathway including  xxxg748xxx  pathway
inhibitor ( xxxg2266xxx ),  xxxg2277xxx  (tm),  xxxg1848xxx , prostacyclin
and heparinoids. finally, due to technical reasons, we only
investigated the liquid sclerosants in this study. the interaction of foam sclerosants with the antithrombotic system is
the subject of the authors’ in vivo studies.
in summary, sts and pol demonstrated quite distinct and
sometimes opposite effects on the antithrombotic mechanisms in vitro. high concentration sts demonstrated
significant anti-xa, anti-iia and anti-va activity but also had
the greatest destructive effect on antithrombotic proteins.
the clinical relevance of these findings is the subject of
further investigations by the authors.
