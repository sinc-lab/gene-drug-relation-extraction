1
the binding of some antidepressant drugs, including some new drugs of atypical structure ( xxxd2137xxx , iprindole, maprotiline,  xxxd2637xxx ,  xxxd2746xxx , tofenacine and viloxazine) to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain has been studied by displacement of [3h]-atropine.
2 many of the drugs are potent muscarinic antagonists.
3 some correlation can be made between the affinity for binding to the muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor and the incidence of anticholinergic side effects in clinical usage.

introduction

radio-ligand binding assays have proved very useful
for studying the interaction of neurotransmitters and
drugs with putative receptor sites in neuronal and
non-neuronal tissues (see for example birdsall &
hulme, 1976; snyder & bennett, 1976). in the case of
antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic class e.g.  xxxd156xxx , imipramine, the therapeutic effects may be
mediated via blockade of the nerve terminal noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) reuptake
sites (carlson, corrodi, fuxe & hokfelt, 1969a, b;
iversen, 1974); ligand binding experiments have
shown, however, that the drugs are also muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor antagonists (see for example
snyder & yamamura, 1977) and a-adrenoceptor antagonists (u'prichard, greenberg, sheehan & snyder,
1978). these studies offer a rationalization for the
anti-muscarinic side effects seen with the drugs as
well as the ability of the drugs to cause sedation and
hypotension (a-adrenoceptor blockade). these interactions may also contribute to the antidepressant
effects of these drugs (see janowsky, el-yousef, davis
& sekerke, 1973; u'prichard et al., 1978). in addition
many antidepressant drugs have been shown to block
histamine receptors in studies on histamine-sensitive
adenylate and guanylate cyclases (green & maayani,
1977; kanof & greengard, 1978; richelson, 1978).
the experiments on a-adrenoceptors, muscarinic,
and histamine receptors mentioned above were carried out mainly with antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic class or those which are  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx 
inhibitors, but several antidepressant drugs of different structural classes are now in clinical use e.g.  xxxd2137xxx , iprindole, maprotiline,  xxxd2637xxx ,  xxxd2746xxx , tofenacine, viloxazine. although these drugs are
0007-1188/80/030541-09 301.00

successful antidepressants they are reported to possess
varying abilities to block noradrenaline and 5-ht reuptake (pinder, brogden, speight & avery, 1977a, b;
sulser, vetulani & mobley, 1978) and so may elicit
their therapeutic effects through other mechanisms.
they are also reported to show varying degrees of
anticholinergic side effects (el-deiry, forrest & littmann, 1967; pinder et al., 1977a, b; kopera, 1978).
in the present paper we describe a study of the
binding of these atypical antidepressant drugs to rat
brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors using [3h]atropine as a radio-ligand. the results indicate that
the ability of a drug to block [3h]-atropine binding
in vitro can be used as a guide for the production of
anticholinergic side effects in vivo.

preparation of brain subcellular fraction (p2)

whole rat brains, obtained from male wistar rats
(250 to 300 g) killed by a sharp blow to the neck, were
*homogenized in ice cold sucrose solution (0.32 m,
9 ml/g wet wt. rat brain) with a teflon-glass homogenizer (0.18 mm radial clearance, 20 strokes). the
homogenate was centrifuged (1000 g, 12 min) and the
supernatant taken. this supernatant was centrifuged
(10,000 g, 30 min) to give a pellet (p2) which was
resuspended for use in assays in an ice cold hepes
(n - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - n'- 2 - ethane-sulphonic
acid-phosphate-saline buffer (6 ml/g original tissue
wet wt.; protein approx. 5 mg/ml). the buffer contained  xxxd3213xxx  (110 mm),  xxxd2988xxx

(5.3 mm), calcium chloride (1.8 mm),  xxxd2534xxx  (0.8 mm), sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate
(0.9 mm) glucose (25 mm), sucrose (50 mm) and
hepes (20 mm) adjusted to ph 7.4 with 1 m sodium
hydroxide solution; the osmolality was approx. 340
mosm. in some experiments a modified buffer was
used which had no hepes; the composition was
otherwise as stated above except that the sucrose was
increased to 70 mm to give an osmolality of approx.
320 mosm. the resuspended p2 preparation was
stored at -200c until required; storage for up to a
week did not result in significant loss of [3h]-atropine binding activity. the protein concentration was
determined by the method of lowry, rosebrough,
farr & randall (1951) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
a standard and for experimental samples employing a
precipitation step with ice cold trichloroethanoic acid
(100 g/l final).
binding studies

ligand binding was measured by a centrifugation
assay similar to that used by terenius (1974).
(±) [g-3h]-atropine (0.2 nm to 50 nm) or [3h]-imipramine (3 nm approx.) was incubated at 300c for 30
min in triplicate or quadruplicate with rat brain p2
preparation (1.0 mg/ml approx. final protein concentration) in a final volume of 1 ml in the above
hepes-phosphate-saline buffer in capped polypropylene centrifuge tubes (1.5 ml, sarstedt, leicester,
leics.). known concentrations of competing drugs
were added at the beginning of the incubation where
appropriate. the bound radioactivity was determined
by rapid centrifugation (14,000 g, 30 s) in a micro-

centrifuge (quickfit, supplied by northern media
supplies, hull, yorkshire) followed by superficial
washing of the pellet with a solution containing
 xxxd3213xxx  (150 mm) and sodium dihydrogen
orthophosphate (10 mm) at ph 7.4. the ends of the
tubes containing the pellet were cut off and placed in
10 ml of scintillant (triton x-100/xylene, 1:2 v/v with
0.6 g 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 0.012 g 1,4 bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl)benzene per 100 ml) in a counting vial.
the pellets were dispersed by vortex mixing and the
radioactivity determined on packard 3255 or 3375
liquid scintillation spectrometers in the external standard mode.
two types of experiment were performed using
[3h]-atropine: direct binding experiments where
specific (-_[3h]-atropine binding was assessed at
various free (-_[3h]-atropine concentrations and
displacement experiments where the binding due to a
fixed concentration of (-}[3h]-atropine was displaced by varying concentrations of an added drug.
in these experiments with atropine a relatively high
receptor site concentration (1 nm) was used so that
significant depletion of added (-)-[3h]-atropine

occurred for added concentrations of 2.5 nm or
less. consequently the free (-)[3h]-atropine concentration varied between assays with and without
added competing drug. therefore in displacement experiments, high concentrations (20 nm to 50 nm) of
(±) [3h]-atropine were added to each assay so that
as the drugs displaced the bound (-)-[3h]-atropine
the free (-}[3h]-atropine changed by less than 15%;
an average value for the free (-}[3h]-atropine concentration was used for calculations in displacement
experiments.
therefore a typical displacement experiment consisted of three sets of assays: (i) (±+ [3h]-atropine (20
nm to 50 nm) was incubated with p2 preparation, with
no further addition to define the sum of specifically
and non-specifically bound radioactivities. (ii) as in (i)
but with the addition of 20 gm (± )atropine (nonradioactive) to define the non-specifically bound
radioactivity (normally between 30% and 60% of total
binding). it is assumed that non-specific binding is the
same in all the assays. (iii) as in (i) but with a known
concentration of competing drug to determine the
degree of displacement of (-)[3h]-atropine binding.
for these displacement experiments the results
were calculated assuming that only the (- )isomer
of atropine was pharmacologically active (see for
example paton & rang, 1965) and that this isomer
represented half the added radioactivity in each
assay, half the non-specifically bound radioactivity
and all the specificially bound radioactivity. the free
(-}[3h]-atropine concentration was calculated by
subtraction for assays with and without excess displacing l'gand and an average taken. the concentrations of drugs required to displace 50% of the
specifically bound (-)-[3h]-atropine were determined from double reciprocal plots and hill plots and
the two values averaged. dissociation constants were
then calculated assuming simple competitive inhibition (using the average free (-)-[3h]-atropine concentration and a value for its dissociation constant of
0.455 nm).
in direct binding experiments two sets of assays
were performed: (i) varying concentrations of (±)[3h]-atropine (0.2 nm to 50 nm) were incubated with
p2 preparation to determine the sum of specifically
and non-specifically bound radioactivities. (ii) as in (i)
but with the addition of non radioactive (± )-atropine
(20 gm); in this assay only non-specifically bound
radioactivity was measured.
particularly at low added [3h]-atropine concentrations the free (-)[3h]-atropine concentrations
were different in sets (i) and (ii) because of the displacement of bound radioactivity in set (ii). since nonspecific binding is dependent on the free ligand concentration, the non specific binding measured in set
(ii) was not an accurate measure of the non specific
binding in set (i) so that the specific binding was not

antidepressant binding to muscarinic receptors

measured accurately by the difference between sets (i)
and (ii) (see also somoza & de feudis, 1978). this
problem was overcome in displacement experiments
by using a high added [3h]-atropine concentration
but for direct binding experiments this was not possible so a more laborious method was used to calculate
the specific binding in these studies. this is outlined
in the appendix. data for specifically bound and free
(-}[3h]-atropine were plotted as scatchard plots,
hill plots and double reciprocal plots and the average
value for the binding parameters was taken.

stability of [3h]-atropine by thin layer chromatography

(±+[3h]-atropine

(54 nm) was incubated with rat
brain p2 preparation as described above and the
bound radioactivity was recovered by centrifugation
(ten separate tubes were used). the pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml water per tube, amalgamated and
non radiolabelled (± )atropine (10 pl, 30 mm) added
and mixed. the ph was adjusted to 9.0 approximately
with sodium hydroxide solution and the solution was
extracted with chloroform (3 x 2.5 ml). where emulsions formed, the mixture could be separated into two
phases by centrifugation (1000 g, 5 min). the amalgamated chloroform extracts were dried over anhydrous
sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness under a
stream of nitrogen gas. the extract was dissolved in
chloroform and applied to a silica gel (merck kieselgel gf254, 0.3 mm) plate and chromatographed in
acetone/water/ammonia (8.75%):90/7/3 v/v. the spots
were located under ultra violet light and the plate was
divided into sections approximately 2 cm x 2 cm
along the track of the spot. these sections were
scraped off into counting vials containing 1 ml of
0.2 m  xxxd3213xxx  in 1 m hci and left for
10 min; 10 ml of scintillant (see above) was added to
each vial and the radioactivity determined. of the
bound radioactivity, 88% was recovered from the thin
layer plate and 95% of this chromatographed with
authentic atropine. therefore, no significant metabolism of the bound radioactive atropine appeared to
be occurring during the experiment. although this
experiment was concerned only with bound radioactivity, part of this bound [3h]-atropine was bound
non-specifically. since non-specific binding is contributed to by entrapment of liquid in the pellet this
shows that free atropine is also undergoing insignificant metabolism.

materials (±) [g-3h]-atropine (426 mci/mmol) and
[3h]-imipramine (21 ci/mmol) were obtained from
the radiochemical centre, amersham, bucks.  xxxd247xxx , bovine  xxxg124xxx  and n-2-hydroxyethyl piperazine-n'-2-ethanesulphonic acid were

poole, dorset. other chemicals were of the highest
purity available. the drugs used were generous gifts
from the following companies: beecham pharmaceuticals ltd., brentford, middlesex ( xxxd2637xxx  hydrochloride), brocades ltd., weybridge, surrey (tofenacine hydrochloride), ciba laboratories, horsham, w.
sussex (maprotiline hydrochloride), geigy pharmaceuticals, macclesfield, cheshire ( xxxd2338xxx , desipramine hydrochloride), hoechst u.k.

 xxxd2137xxx  hydrochloride), pfizer ltd., sandwich,
kent (doxepin hydrochloride), roche ltd., welwyn
garden city, herts. ( xxxd156xxx ) and wyeth laboratories, maidenhead, berks. (iprindole hydrochloride).
drugs were generally dissolved  xxxd1891xxx -2 m in assay
buffer and diluted appropriately for assays.  xxxd2637xxx 
hydrochloride was dissolved  xxxd1891xxx ' m in assay buffer
containing 0.5% ethanol and diluted appropriately.
the concentration of ethanol used did not affect binding of [3h]-atropine.

results

specific (-}[3h]-atropine binding was found to be
at equilibrium within 5 min ((±
+-[3h]-atropine 7 nk
results not shown) and assays were carried out for 30
min to ensure equilibration. no significant metabolism of the radio-ligand occurred during this period.
from direct binding experiments a dissociation constant of 4.55 x 10`0 m + 1.12 x 1010 m (mean
± s.d., 4 experiments) and a hill coefficient of
1.04 + 0.12 (mean ± s.d., 4 experiments) were determined. this is in agreement with the data of hulme,
birdsall, burgen & mehta (1978) on rat brain (kd
6.25 x 10-10 m; hill coefficient 0.92). it is possible
that the hepes buffer used in the present experiments might bind to the muscarinic receptor (see for
example, richelson, prendergast & divinetz-romero,
1978). accordingly, parallel p2 preparations were
made in the standard hepes-phosphate-saline buffer
and in a buffer containing identical concentrations of
ions but lacking hepes and containing slightly more
sucrose to maintain the osmolarity. direct binding
experiments with atropine gave the following binding
parameters in the hepes containing buffer: kd
5.39 x 1010 m, hill coefficient 1.0, number of sites
1.69 nmol/g protein and in the buffer lacking hepes:
kd 3.59 x 10-10 m, hill coefficient 1.2, number of
sites 1.46 nmol/g protein. clearly hepes has no profound effect on muscarinic binding but if the differences between dissociation constants are significant
then this indicates a dissociation constant at the muscarinic receptor for hepes of approx. 40 mm. this
would not affect the dissociation constants for ligands

figure i displacement of specifically bound ([3h]-atropine from rat brain membranes by  xxxd156xxx  (0), maprotiline (a) and viloxazine (o), was assayed
as described in the experimental section. zero %
specific binding was defined by the addition of 20 gm
(± )-atropine so that negative values of specific binding
refer to displacement of more bound [3h]-atropine
than that produced by 20 gm (± )atropine. all displacements are expressed as percentages of the total
specific binding. the average free (-)-[3h]-atropine
concentrations were 24.73 nm ( xxxd156xxx ); 12.47 nm
(maprotiline) and 12.60 nm (viloxazine). the curves
drawn for  xxxd156xxx  and maprotiline are theoretical
curves obtained by applying the law of mass action to
the formation of a bimolecular complex (half maximal
inhibition given by 1.9 x 106 m  xxxd156xxx  and
2.6 x 10' m maprotiline).

measured by displacement (see below) since all data
obtained in the same buffer systems.
various drugs were assayed for inhibition of
[3h]-atropine binding and representative displacement curves are shown in figure 1. most of the drugs
used displaced [3h]-atropine and dissociation constants are given in table 1; there is good agreement
with published data for  xxxd156xxx  and imipramine
(rehavi, maayani & sokolovsky, 1977) and for  xxxd2137xxx  (miller & hiley, 1974). hill coefficients were
determined where possible and these were mostly
close to unity, indicating that the drugs were probably
muscarinic antagonists according to the classification
of birdsall & hulme (1976). in some cases hill slopes
of greater than unity were observed; this may be
because at the higher concentrations of drug used, the
drugs were displacing some non specifically bound
[3h]-atropine as discussed below.
the data of figure 1 illustrate that some of the
drugs tested displaced more than 100% of the specifically bound [3h]-atropine as defined by 20 gm nonwere

radioactive (± )-atropine, suggesting that they are
displacing some non-specifically bound, non-receptor
associated radioactivity. for example 10' m imipramine displaced 26% of the non specifically bound
(± )-[3h]-atropine whereas 10' m atropine displaced only 10%. this may be because some of the
drugs tested e.g. imipramine and other tricyclic antidepressants are very lipophilic and partition strongly
into membrane or organic phases (see for example
leo, hansch & elkins, 1971). the inhibition of nonspecific binding was tested by an experiment where
[3h]-atropine binding in the absence (specific and
non-specific binding) and in the presence (non-specific
binding) of non-radioactive (± )-atropine (20 gm) was
displaced by increasing concentrations of imipramine
(figure 2). in the absence of 20 gm (±)atropine the
displacement data for imipramine concentrations up
to 3 x 10-5 m conform well to the theoretical curve
for combination of a ligand with a single class of
receptor sites: this presumably represents binding to
the muscarinic receptor. in the presence of atropine
no displacement occurs until imipramine concentrations of greater than 10-5 m are used and in this
range the data with and without 20 pm (±+atropine
are in good agreement. this shows that in this range
displacement of non-specifically bound [3h]-atropine
is occurring. therefore the imipramine displacement
curve (figure 2) may be adequately described as a
sum of displacement at muscarinic receptor sites (imipramine 10-5 m) and displacement of non-specifically bound atropine (imipramine . 10' m).
the binding of imipramine to brain membranes has
been studied by hunt, kannengiesser & raynaud
(1975) and weinstein, varon & roberts (1971) who
demonstrated low affinity binding sites. we have confirmed this and could find no reproducible high
affinity (kd < 3 x 10-8 m approx.) saturable binding
sites for imipramine. [3h]-imipramine (3 nm approx.)
binding was not significantly inhibited by atropine
(10 gm); significant binding to the muscarinic receptor
would not be expected under these conditions. high
concentrations of non-radiolabelled imipramine (10
jm to 1 mm) and other antidepressant drugs did, however, show inhibition (table 2). this is the same concentration range in which imipramine inhibited nonspecific atropine binding as well as showing effects on
various membrane bound enzymes e.g. adenylate
cyclase (palmer, 1976); atpase (roufogalis, 1975).
therefore this inhibition of imipramine binding is
likely to be due to non-specific drug-membrane interactions. the total binding of [3h]-imipramine is quite
high, however, considering that the binding is primarily low affinity; for example, at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and a total imipramine concentration of 3.2 ns, 41% of the [3h]-imipramine was
bound to the membrane pellet at equilibrium. therefore, although displacement of [3h]-imipramine by

antidepressant binding to muscarinic receptors

high concentrations (10 pm to 10 mm) of competing
drugs may not be physiologically relevant, the high
tissue binding of imipramine even at low concentrations may affect the uptake and elimination
characteristics of the drug. imipramine seems, then, to
bind to a large number of low affinity membrane
sites; this is probably associated with the lipophilicity
of the drug and contributes to the high tissue binding
of the drug. inhibition of [3h]-imipramine binding by
high imipramine concentrations is also probably due
to interaction at these sites. a small number of the
sites may also be occupied non-specifically by low
concentrations of [3h]-atropine. this contributes to
non specific atropine binding and competition for
these sites by high concentrations of imipramine leads
to the observed inhibition of non specific atropine
binding.
burgermeister, klein, nirenberg & witkop (1978)
have shown that local anaesthetics inhibit muscarinicreceptor ligand-binding in a non-competitive manner.
although it has been assumed that the tricyclic antidepressants are competitive muscarinic antagonists
because of the lipophilic nature of the drugs, it was
necessary to establish this. therefore direct [3h]atropine binding was assayed in the presence of different concentrations of imipramine (at concentrations
where it shows antimuscarinic effects only). the
results (figure 3) show that imipramine does not alter
the maximum number of [3h]-atropine binding sites;
a non-competitive model where imipramine decreases
the maximum number of receptor sites may be ruled

out so that the inhibition is most likely to be a
simple competitive one. assuming competitive-inhibition, a value of 1.68 x 10-7 m was calculated for the
dissociation constant of imipramine using the data of
figure 3. this is in very good agreement with the data
of table 1. an alternative model was considered
where imipramine inhibition was non-competitive but
led to an increased disssociation constant for [3h]atropine in the presence of imipramine and an unchanged total number of binding sites. however,
when this model was applied to the direct binding
data of figure 3 the dissociation constants derived
would not generate the data observed in displacement
experiments (e.g. figure 2) unless binding of atropine
and imipramine are mutually exclusive. consequently
imipramine and the other drugs tested are most likely
to be competitive antagonists.

discussion
most of the newer atypical antidepressant drugs
tested in this radio-ligand binding assay were muscarinic receptor antagonists. when the dissociation constants (kd) for all the drugs tested (table 1) were compared they were found to fall approximately into four
groups: (i)  xxxd156xxx  with the lowest kd and therefore highest affinity of the drugs tested for the muscarinic receptor; (ii) drugs with dissociation constants in
the 1 x 10' m to 7 x 10- m range: desipramine,
doxepin, imipramine, maprotiline,  xxxd2637xxx , tofena-

some of the drugs tested displaced non-specifically
bound [3h]-atropine and this was probably due to
their lipophilic nature. at high concentrations the
drugs form loose associations with membrane components and this may lead to displacement of nonreceptor associated [3h]-atropine from similar sites.
therefore, for imipramine the displacement curve
(figure 2) may be completely described as the sum of
two components: muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
binding (imipramine . 10-i m) and membrane associated displacement of non specific [3h]-atropine binding ( > io-i m imipramine).
there is good agreement between the dissociation
constants obtained here in a broken cell preparation
of brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and those
obtained by shein & smith (1978) for inhibition of
smooth muscle contraction by some of the drugs. this
confirms the findings of snyder & yamamura (1977)
that the receptors from brain and smooth muscle
show very similar ligand binding characteristics.
therefore binding of the drugs to brain muscarinic
receptors can be used to assess binding in other tissues where anticholinergic side effects occur. shein &
smith (1978) also observed apparent non-competitive
behaviour in some of the drugs at concentrations
above 10'- m: this may have been due to the nonspecific membrane effects observed in the present
studies.
there seems to be broad agreement between the
anti-muscarinic potencies of drugs determined from
the ability to inhibit [3h]-atropine binding and the
ability of drugs to produce anti-cholinergic side effects
in vivo (table 1). drugs with very low dissociation
constants e.g.  xxxd156xxx  show a high incidence of

antidepressant binding to muscarinic receptors
anticholinergic side effects whereas drugs which are
poor muscarinic ligands e.g. viloxazine show no anticholinergic side effects in clinical use. although production of side-effects depends on many factors like
the dosage, plasma levels of drug, tissue levels of drug,
drug accessibility, it appears that the in vitro radioligand binding assay can be used broadly to predict
the incidence of anticholinergic side effects in vivo.
therefore, it may be used, as suggested by snyder &
yamamura (1977) to judge which drug to prescribe in
certain situations where anticholinergic side effects
would be undesirable e.g. glaucoma; furthermore it is
a very simple test and could be used as a screening
technique for assessing anticholinergic potencies in
new drugs. from this standpoint the newer drugs
tested all showed reduced anticholinergic potency
relative to tricyclic antidepressants and so may be
preferable where anticholinergic side effects are undesirable.  xxxd2637xxx  is an exception to this correlation;
it is moderately potent in the [3h]-atropine displacement test but appears to show no anticholinergic side
effects in clinical use. this may be due to poor accessibility of the drug to the relevant area of tissue.
lastly, it has been suggested that the anticholinergic interaction of antidepressant drugs may contribute to their clinical potency (janowsky et al., 1973;
snyder & yamamura, 1977). some of the drugs tested
here e.g. viloxazine,  xxxd2746xxx  as well as the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors tested by snyder & yamamura (1977) are successful antidepressants but virtually devoid of anticholinergic interactions so that
binding to muscarinic receptors is not a prerequisite
for antidepressant activity.

n+ and n- must be equal because series a contains only non-specific binding and the free concentrations of both isomers must be the same; therefore

[3h]-imipramine binding was assayed as described in the text. the ic50 is the concentration of drug which gave
50% inhibition of specific [3h]-imipramine binding as defined by the difference between assays with and without
3 x 10-3 m non-radiolabelled imipramine. where lower limits are given this is an estimate based upon the
inhibition given by the highest drug concentration used.

n - = ba!2 and this enables fj- to be calculated
(eqn. 3). since the (+}isomer is pharmacologically
inactive n + and n + must be equal, allowing
(n; + s-) to be calculated from eqn. 2 and bb; hence
f- can be calculated from eqn. 4.
