a novel strategy for improving the treatment of depressive
illness is augmentation of antidepressants with a 5-ht11a
autoreceptor antagonist. however, trials using the
5-ht11a/␤-blocker  xxxd2957xxx  are proving inconsistent. we
report how positron emission tomography (pet) and in
vitro autoradiography can inform trials of antidepressant
augmentation. we show that in healthy volunteers, in vivo,
 xxxd2957xxx  (n ⫽ 10) and  xxxd2869xxx  (n ⫽ 4), but not tertatolol
(n ⫽ 4) occupy the human 5-ht1a receptors, at clinical
doses.  xxxd2957xxx , as well as the ␤-blockers  xxxd2869xxx  and
tertatolol, has high affinity for human 5-ht1a receptors in

post-mortem brain slices (n ⫽ 4).  xxxd2957xxx  shows preference
for 5-ht1a autoreceptors versus the post-synaptic receptors
both in vitro and in vivo. our data reveal that  xxxd2957xxx 
doses used in antidepressant trials so far are suboptimal for
significant occupancy at the 5-ht1a autoreceptor.
 xxxd2869xxx  or higher doses of  xxxd2957xxx  are candidates for
testing as antidepressant augmenting regimes in future
clinical trials. [neuropsychopharmacology 23:285–293,

ssris are increasingly used in the pharmacological treatment of depression. ssris specifically block 5-ht reuptake sites leading to an eventual increase of 5-ht in terminal synapses; an effect considered to be an important
component of antidepressant action (blier et al. 1990). ssris are better tolerated than less selective agents such as
tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) (anderson 1997), however, their efficacy is no greater (rudorfer and potter
1989) (≅70% of patients respond), and at least 2-3 weeks
of treatment is required for the appearance of meaningful therapeutic response (paykel and priest 1992).
preclinical studies suggest the inhibition of 5-ht reuptake by ssris, does not lead to increased 5-ht levels
in terminal synapses until an adaptive desensitization of
inhibitory 5-ht1a autoreceptors has occurred (blier et al.

0893-133x/00/$–see front matter
pii s0893-133x(00)00109-3

286 e.a. rabiner et al.

1990; chaput et al. 1986;chaput et al. 1991; de montigny
et al. 1990; hjorth and auerbach 1994). these autoreceptors, located on 5-ht neuronal cell bodies in the raphe
nuclei, inhibit 5-ht neurone firing, and hence 5-ht release in terminal synapses (vandermaelen et al. 1986;
adell and artigas 1991; invernizzi et al. 1992; sharp et al.
1989). thus, indirect 5-ht1a autoreceptor activation by
ssris (via elevated 5-ht in the raphe nuclei) may impair
the drug’s therapeutic efficacy until desensitization has
occurred. theoretically, co-administration of 5-ht1a autoreceptor antagonists (blocking the tonic inhibitory effect of 5-ht on the autoreceptor), together with ssris,
may decrease the time needed to achieve clinical benefit
and lead to a greater therapeutic effect (hjorth 1993;
artigas 1993). in the absence of selective  xxxg1108xxx 
antagonists for human use, therapeutic trials have been
conducted with  xxxd2957xxx , a ␤-blocker with nanomolar affinity for the human  xxxg1108xxx  in transfected cells
in culture (newman-tancredi et al. 1998). controlled
clinical trials have produced mixed results. four studies
demonstrated a beneficial effect of  xxxd2957xxx  augmentation of ssri treatment (zanardi et al. 1997; perez et al.
1997; bordet et al. 1998; maes et al. 1996), one study
showed a mixed response (tome et al. 1997), while three
studies failed to demonstrate any antidepressant benefit
(moreno et al. 1997; berman et al. 1997; perez et al. 1999).
the equivocal results of clinical studies raise several
questions about  xxxd2957xxx ’s proposed mechanism of action. firstly it is not clear whether the dose of  xxxd2957xxx 
used clinically (typically 2.5 mg thrice daily (tds)),
achieves a significant occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors in
the living human brain. secondly, emergent evidence
from preclinical studies indicates that  xxxd2957xxx , unlike
certain other ␤-blockers, may have 5-ht1a partial agonist
properties (hjorth and carlsson 1986; newman-tancredi
et al. 1998; clifford et al. 1998;gartside et al. 1999). partial
agonism could lead to an activation of 5-ht1a autoreceptors with subsequent decrease in 5-ht release in limbic
and cortical areas, opposite to the desired effect. and
thirdly, a dose of  xxxd2957xxx  which blocks the 5-ht 1a
autoreceptor might be expected to also block the postsynaptic  xxxg1108xxx , potentially counteracting any
antidepressant effect. post-synaptic 5-ht1a receptors are
located in cortical and limbic areas (peroutka 1985; pazos
et al. 1988), where they mediate the effects of 5-ht released from the nerve terminals (blier et al. 1990; chaput
et al. 1991; invernizzi et al. 1991; sinton and fallon 1988).
two other ␤-blockers,  xxxd2869xxx  and tertatolol, also
display nanomolar affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx  in
rodent brain (prisco et al. 1993; jolas et al. 1993; hjorth
and sharp 1993). in rat microdialysis studies  xxxd2869xxx 
and tertatolol reliably increase the levels of extracellular
5-ht, unlike  xxxd2957xxx  in some studies (gartside et al.
1999), when co-administered with an ssri. they may
therefore be more suitable than  xxxd2957xxx  as 5-ht1a autoreceptor antagonists for augmentation of ssris.

neuropsychopharmacology 2000–vol. 23, no. 3

in light of the above, the aims of the present study
were; to test the affinity of  xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxd2869xxx  and tertatolol at the 5-ht1a autoreceptor and post-synaptic receptor, in the postmortem human brain, and assess the
ability of clinical doses of these drugs to occupy the human 5-ht1a autoreceptor and post-synaptic receptor
sites in vivo.

materials and methods
subjects
eighteen healthy male volunteers (ages 27–54) were recruited by a newspaper advertisement. all subjects gave
informed consent. the study was approved by the imperial college school of medicine ethics committee and
the administration of radioactive substances advisory
committee. the volunteers were examined by a qualified
psychiatrist (ear) and a modified scid for dsm iv was
employed to exclude concurrent psychiatric illness. they
had a full physical examination, and were not on any concurrent medication. all subjects underwent two open
label [11c]way-100635 pet scans with a median interval
of eight days between the scans (range 4-258 days). the
first was a baseline scan while the second was conducted
following a single oral dose of one of the three ␤-blockers.
 xxxd2957xxx  scans were conducted two hours following
a 5-mg (n ⫽ 3), 10-mg (n ⫽ 4), or 20-mg (n ⫽ 3), dose of
(⫹/⫺) xxxd2957xxx  ( xxxd2957xxx , sandoz pharmaceuticals).  xxxd2869xxx  scans were conducted 3 hours following a 40mg (n ⫽ 2), or an 80-mg (n ⫽ 2) dose of (⫺) xxxd2869xxx 
(levotol, schwarz pharma). tertatolol scans were conducted 90 minutes following a 5-mg (n ⫽ 2), or a 10-mg
dose (n ⫽ 2) of (⫹/⫺)tertatolol (artex, servier). the
times of the scan were chosen to coincide with the tmax
of the drug in plasma ( xxxd2957xxx  1-3 hours,  xxxd2869xxx  2-4
hours, tertatolol 1-2 hours).

pet scan acquisition
pet scans were performed on an ecat 953b pet camera (cti/siemens, knoxville, tn, usa) (spinks et al.
1992) in three-dimensional mode with dual window
scatter correction (grootoonk et al. 1996). [11c]way100635 was prepared at the cyclotron unit by 11c-carboxylation of a grignard reagent (mccarron et al. 1996).
venous blood samples were taken for estimation of
plasma levels of the ␤-blocker at the time of injection of
radioligand (t ⫽ 0 seconds).

pet data analysis
the [11c]way-100635 pet scans were analyzed using a
reference tissue compartmental model, with the cerebellum as a reference tissue (lammertsma and hume
1996; gunn et al. 1998). the cerebellum was chosen as a

neuropsychopharmacology 2000–vol. 23, no. 3

reference tissue because it has an extremely low number of 5-ht1a receptors (hall et al. 1996). the reference
tissue model allows the estimation of relative ligand delivery (ri ⫽ k1 region of interest / k1 reference region) and
binding potential (bp ⫽ f2 bavail / kd, where f2 is the
“free fraction” of the radioligand in the tissue not specifically bound, bavail is the concentration of available
binding sites and kd is the equilibrium dissociation rate
constant of the radioligand (cunningham and lammertsma 1994)). the reference tissue model was applied
at the voxel level, using a basis function implementation
(gunn et al. 1997, 1998), and parametric maps of bp and
ri were generated. occupancy of the  xxxg1108xxx 
sites was inferred as a reduction of bp, and hence
bavail, under the assumption that f2 and kd remain constant for the two scans.
we examined the midbrain raphe nuclei (rn), a
small beaded structure consisting of serotonergic cell
bodies with a high concentration of pre-synaptic 5-ht 1a
autoreceptors. the rn is undetectable on mri but is
well defined on a [11c]way-100635 pet image. for this
reason the roi for the rn was defined manually on an
integral image (20-90 minutes) for each individual pet
scan. the resultant roi was then applied onto the bp
and ri images to generate the bp and ri values. these
values for the rn were assumed to be representative of
5-ht1a autoreceptor values.
cortical and limbic regions of interest (rois) were
defined on an averaged mri image in mni space (montreal neurological institute), to create a generic roi
map. a [11c]way-100635 template (meyer et al. 1999),
also in mni space, was warped onto each individual
[11c]way-100635 image, using spm96 (friston et al.
1991) normalization with 12 parameters. the transformation parameters were then applied to the roi map,
producing an individualized roi map for each subject.
the individualized roi map was applied to bp and r i
images to obtain regional values for these parameters.
this technique allowed us to examine 14 brain rois in
temporal, parietal, prefrontal and cingulate cortex,
which contain post-synaptic 5-ht1a receptors. a representative value for post-synaptic 5-ht1a receptors from
the mean bp in all post-synaptic regions, weighted for
the region size, was calculated. the individual cortical
and limbic regions were also examined as independent
regions to elicit regional variations in the post-synaptic
 xxxg1108xxx  occupancy.
a set of previously acquired test-retest data (analyzed as above) of 10 healthy volunteers (9 males and 1
female, median age 32, range 22–56, screened by a qualified psychiatrist to exclude psychiatric, or general
medical illness) scanned on two occasions with a median interval of 56 days (range 14-489 days), was used
as a control group in the subsequent statistical analysis.
 xxxg1108xxx  occupancy (as per equation 1) was calculated and compared to the differences in bp between

␤-blocker occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors 287

the two scans of the control group. the ri data were analyzed in a similar manner to the bp data [eq. (1)].

autoradiography
human brain tissue was obtained at autopsy from four
subjects (two men and two women, age 67 ⫾ 9 years,
post-mortem delay ⫽ 24.8 ⫾ 3.6 hours) with no reported neurological or psychiatric disorders. sequential
14-␮m cryostat sections from hippocampus and dorsal
raphe nucleus were thaw-mounted on to gelatinized
slides and stored at ⫺20⬚c until use. autoradiographic
procedure was modified from khawaja (1995). brain
sections were preincubated for 30 minutes in 50 mm
tris-hcl buffer (ph ⫽ 7.5), prior to incubation with or
without drug for two hours in 50 mm tris-hcl buffer
containing 10 ␮m  xxxd2850xxx  with 3 nm [3h]way-100635
(specific activity 80 ci/mmol, wyeth research uk ltd).
non-specific binding was determined using 10 mm unlabeled 5-ht. following incubation, sections were washed
2 x 2 minutes in ice-cold buffer, briefly dipped in deionized water at 4°c and air-dried. autoradiograms
were generated by opposing labelled tissues to tritiated
microscales and [3h]-sensitive film for six weeks (hyperfilm, amersham plc, uk). autoradiograms were quantified using a computerized image analysis system (mcid
system, image research, st. catherine’s, canada).

statistical analysis
occupancy results were analyzed by means of one way
anovas, for the autoreceptor and the post-synaptic
regions, with dose (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg), as the betweengroup factor. post hoc dunnett t-tests were performed to
assess the influence of dose on each region. differential
occupancy effects were analyzed by means of paired
students t-tests.

results
 xxxd2957xxx  achieves significant occupancy of the
 xxxg1108xxx 
both the 5-ht1a autoreceptor and the post-synaptic receptor sites showed a dose-dependent increase in 5-ht1a
receptor occupancy by  xxxd2957xxx  (figure 1 and table 1).
all post-synaptic regions showed similar levels of occupancy for a given dose, with a high correlation of occupancy between all post-synaptic regions (mean r ⫽ 0.93,
range: 0.77–0.99, for any two regions). further analysis
was therefore performed on an average of the post-synaptic  xxxg1108xxx  regions and the autoreceptor region (rn). there was a significant effect of  xxxd2957xxx  on

(f(3,16) ⫽ 15.201, p ⬍ .001). post hoc testing revealed that
both the 10-mg and the 20-mg doses, but not the 5-mg dose,
produced statistically significant occupancy of the 5-ht 1a
receptor in both regions (figure 1). there was no correlation between occupancy and duration of the betweenscan interval.
plasma  xxxd2957xxx  levels were available for nine of the
10 subjects who received  xxxd2957xxx . higher levels were
associated with increased  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy
apart from one outlier (table 1). we estimated the
chronic dosing regime of  xxxd2957xxx  required to achieve the
plasma levels, which were associated with autoreceptor
occupancy of at least 20 % in this study (plasma concentration that caused ⬎20% occupancy was ⬎12 ng/ml,
table 1). the equation, dose = c av v d tau ⁄ 1.44ft 1 ⁄ 2 (rowland and tozer 1980), gave an estimate of the dose of
 xxxd2957xxx  required to be given at an 8-hourly interval (␶),
to achieve steady state plasma levels (c␣␯) of 12 ng/ml.

over the full range of values for vd and t1/2, the dose
range for a 70 kg subject is 1.6–4.1 mg tds.
 xxxd2957xxx  had no significant effect on the relative delivery of radioligand to the region of interest, compared
to the reference region (analysis of ri values–autoreceptor region, f(3,16) ⫽ 0.491, p ⫽ .694, post-synaptic
region, f(3,16) ⫽ 1.166, p ⫽ .354).

 xxxd2957xxx  has a differential occupancy of
autoreceptor compared to post-synaptic receptor
sites in vivo
there was a differential occupancy by  xxxd2957xxx  of
5-ht1a autoreceptors compared to post-synaptic recep-

tors at the 10-mg dose (37% vs. 13% respectively, paired ttest t(3) ⫽ 19.224, p ⬍ 0.001, figure 1). this effect was not
seen at other doses (20-mg 39% vs. 46%, p ⫽ .245; 5-mg
10% vs. 5%, p ⫽ .576; control ⫺7% vs. ⫺6%, p ⫽ .881).
we estimated the maintenance dose of  xxxd2957xxx  required
for plasma levels, which were associated with high differential occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors (12-18 ng/ml,
table 1). using dose = c av v d tau ⁄ 1.44ft 1 ⁄ 2 as above, the
dose range for a 70 kg patient is 1.6-6.2 mg tds.

 xxxd2869xxx  but not tertatolol produces consistent
occupancy of the  xxxg1108xxx 
 xxxd2869xxx  at both the 40 mg and the 80 mg dose also
occupied 5-ht1a receptors in both autoreceptor and
post-synaptic receptor regions. at the doses tested (5
and 10 mg) tertatolol did not demonstrate consistent occupancy of the  xxxg1108xxx  at either site, with only
one subject at the higher dose, showing an effect (table
2). we saw no differential 5-ht1a autoreceptor to postsynaptic receptor occupancy at either of the  xxxd2869xxx 
doses examined.

 xxxd2957xxx  but not  xxxd2869xxx  or tertatolol displays
differential affinity for the 5-ht1a autoreceptor
compared to the post-synaptic receptor in vitro
 xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxd2869xxx  and tertatolol displayed high affinity for 5-ht1a binding sites in postmortem human
brain sections (table 3). given our in vivo results, and
the suggestion by romero (romero et al. 1996) that  xxxd2957xxx  preferentially affects autoreceptor versus postsynaptic  xxxg1108xxx  function, we estimated the affinity of  xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxd2869xxx  and tertatolol for the 5-ht1a
autoreceptor compared to post-synaptic receptor.  xxxd2957xxx , but not the other drugs displayed a difference in

discussion
 xxxd2957xxx  administered acutely to healthy subjects occupies the  xxxg1108xxx  in a dose dependent manner.
a 20 mg dose produced substantial 5-ht1a site occupancy (≅40%) at both the autoreceptor and the postsynaptic sites in limbic and cortical regions, consistent
with previous pilot studies (rabiner et al. 1998; andree
et al. 1999). congruent with our findings, oral doses of
30 mg  xxxd2957xxx  in man block both autoreceptor and
post-synaptic functional responses to the  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, buspirone (anderson and cowen 1992)
and flesinoxan (seletti et al. 1995). we observed no consistent occupancy at either the 5-ht1a autoreceptor or

the post-synaptic receptor by 5 mg of  xxxd2957xxx .  xxxd2957xxx 
levels ⬎ 12 ng/ml, in our study were associated with
autoreceptor occupancy of ⬎ 20%. the mean plasma
levels of  xxxd2957xxx  achieved in the reported clinical studies of 2.5 mg tds of  xxxd2957xxx , 7.0 ng/ml (artigas et al.
1997) and 9.9 ⫾ 5.1 ng/ml (perez et al. 1999), are in the
lower range of levels achieved by our subjects and
would be expected to produce low and/or variable occupancy of the 5-ht1a autoreceptor (table 1). a dose at
the lower end of the effective range for occupancy may
explain the variable results of controlled clinical trials.
our data, albeit in a small sample, and calculations suggest that a regimen of 5 mg tds may be required to produce consistent occupancy of the 5-ht1a autoreceptor
of about 20%. if a higher occupancy is needed to produce a clinically significant effect, then an even higher
dose of  xxxd2957xxx  would be required. interestingly a similar conclusion has been reached in an independent
study (m.laruelle, personal communication).
the differential occupancy  xxxd1891xxx  mg suggests that
 xxxd2957xxx  may have a higher affinity for the 5-ht1a autoreceptor compared to the post-synaptic receptor. although the number of subjects demonstrating this effect

is small, a similar differential occupancy was demonstrated in an independent study at another centre
(m.laruelle, personal communication). laruelle and colleagues found differential occupancy also at the higher
doses of  xxxd2957xxx , while we found no differential occupancy at the 20 mg dose. these findings are supported
by our autoradiographic data, which demonstrates a
slightly lower ki for  xxxd2957xxx  in the dorsal raphe nucleus, compared to the ca1 region of the hippocampus,
although a recent study failed to show this difference in
a similar sized sample (raurich et al. 1999). the methods
used in both studies were very similar. therefore the
discrepancy in results may be due to the small number
of subjects in both studies (n ⫽ 4). data from a larger
number of postmortem brains are required to confirm or
refute our in vitro results. an alternative explanation of
the differential occupancy at autoreceptors and postsynaptic receptors may be a difference of microenvironment, or a difference in the proportion of g-protein coupled/g-protein uncoupled receptors between the raphe
and cortical regions. interestingly, a 2-fold higher affinity of  xxxd2957xxx  for the 5-ht1a autoreceptor, compared to
post-synaptic receptor, was reported in a recent rat pet
study also using [11c]way-100635 (gunn et al. 1999; hirani et al. 1999). interestingly, we did not find a differential occupancy at the 20 mg dose, although only three
subjects were studied. in contrast with our study,
laruelle et al report a differential occupancy at the
higher doses (m. laruelle, personal communication).
differential occupancy may be of clinical importance. a dose of  xxxd2957xxx , which is able to preferentially
antagonize 5-ht1a autoreceptors, without blocking
post-synaptic sites, would facilitate ssri induced release of 5-ht into the synaptic cleft in cortical and limbic areas, without blocking post-synaptic 5-ht1a receptors that mediate the effects of 5-ht. the standard dose
of  xxxd2957xxx  used in clinical trials, 2.5 mg tds, lies in the
lower end of the range suggested by our calculations to
lead to high differential occupancy (1.6-6.2 mg tds).
in our small sample  xxxd2869xxx , but not tertatolol, in
clinically approved doses, achieved consistent occupancy of the  xxxg1108xxx  in humans in vivo despite
their similar affinities in vitro. the lack of consistent occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors by tertatolol may be due to
the low brain penetration by tertatolol (campbell et al.
1986). the only subject showing appreciable  xxxg1108xxx  occupancy had the highest plasma level of tertatolol. our occupancy data suggest  xxxd2869xxx  may be a
useful alternative 5-ht1a antagonist for further clinical
investigation, especially as it has been shown to augment 5-ht release when combined with an ssri (gartside et al. 1999). however, doses of  xxxd2869xxx  which
antagonize the 5-ht1a autoreceptor are also likely to
block the post-synaptic receptor, as there was no differential occupancy at the autoreceptor and ki were simi-

lar in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus on autoradiography (table 3).

conclusions
our in vitro results demonstrate that all three drugs
have a high affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx , with no
pronounced regional selectivity, although  xxxd2957xxx  displays a modest difference in affinity between the autoreceptor and post-synaptic receptor. our in vivo study
supports the theory that 5-ht1a autoreceptor site is an
important target in the central action of  xxxd2957xxx . a
dose higher than used currently will be required, if the
aim of  xxxd2957xxx  administration is to achieve consistent
autoreceptor occupancy. we observed a differential occupancy of autoreceptor compared to post-synaptic receptor sites at the 10-mg dose of  xxxd2957xxx , which is consistent with the modest difference in affinity found in our in
vitro study. overall, our study demonstrates the utility of
pet in directly testing novel sites of antidepressant drug
action, and supports the notion that the 5-ht1a autoreceptor is a candidate site for antidepressant drug action.
