abstract
 xxxd3435xxx  is a derivative of  xxxd3159xxx  with a well-established platelet aggregation inhibitory profile. its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties differ, however,
somewhat from those of  xxxd234xxx . a number of recent experimental and clinical
studies have shown that  xxxd3435xxx  is a potentially useful choice in the treatment and prophylaxis of brain ischemia because of its antithrombogenic as well as neuroprotective effects.
its antithrombogenic effect has been demonstrated at the clinical as well as at the experimental level, while its neuroprotective effect has been shown only in experimental
models. the drug interferes with thrombogenesis by inhibiting thromboxane synthesis and
increasing the levels of camp and  xxxd2738xxx . its neuroprotective action is the result of
its antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects in brain tissue. from a clinical standpoint
 xxxd3435xxx  is similar in efficacy to  xxxd234xxx  in preventing stroke, but has less adverse effects, especially it is less likely to cause bleeding. because of its pharmacodynamic properties and lower rate of adverse reactions,  xxxd3435xxx  may be a useful alternative to
 xxxd234xxx  in the prevention of stroke.

introduction
pharmacological approaches to the treatment of brain ischemia are based on two fundamental concepts:
a) avoidance of an initial (primary prevention) or subsequent thrombotic events (secondary prevention), since after the first stroke patients are more likely to have another
stroke. inhibitors of platelet aggregation are used as a preventive therapy, because
platelets are the first blood elements to be activated in arterial thrombosis (7,8).
b) protection of brain tissue from ischemic damage and avoidance of the spread of the
cell damage to the surrounding tissue (ischemic twilight zone). there is no consensus on

this point regarding how to best preserve brain function, i.e., which cytoprotective or neuroprotective drugs should be used (4,31).
 xxxd3435xxx  ( xxxd3435xxx ®, uriach & cia s.a., barcelona, spain) is a derivative of salicylic
acid with a well-established antiplatelet profile that differs from that of  xxxd234xxx 
(asa) in its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (26). a number of recent
experimental and clinical studies have shown that  xxxd3435xxx  is a potentially useful choice in
the treatment and prophylaxis of brain ischemia because of its antithrombogenic as well as
neuroprotective effects. its antithrombogenic properties have been demonstrated clinically
and experimentally, while its neuroprotective effects have been shown only in animal
models (1–3,33,34,42). in this article we review the most important features of  xxxd3435xxx ,
with particular attention to its effect on brain ischemia.

chemistry
the empirical formula of  xxxd3435xxx , or 2-(acetyloxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)- xxxd306xxx 
(fig. 1) is  xxxd3435xxx  and its molecular weight is 248.16. the drug is usually produced as
white crystals with a melting point of 110–112°c (26). although its chemical synthesis is
different from that of asa, it is structurally related to  xxxd3159xxx . it differs from the
latter in having a trifluoromethyl group in position 4. in humans  xxxd3435xxx  is metabolized
in the liver to 2-(hydroxyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)- xxxd306xxx  (htb) (fig. 1), htb differs
chemically from  xxxd3159xxx  (which is the metabolite of asa) in the same way as their
corresponding precursors.

pharmacokinetics
administration and absorption
 xxxd3435xxx  is administered orally. it is absorbed primarily in the small intestines and its
bioavailability in humans ranges from 83% to 100% (47,48).

distribution
once absorbed, 99% of  xxxd3435xxx  binds to plasma proteins in experimental animals as
well as in humans. it readily crosses organic barriers. however, because it binds exten-

sively to plasma proteins, its blood levels are always higher than tissue levels (43,44,47,48).
it has been recently found that the daily oral intake of 600 mg  xxxd3435xxx  led to htb levels
in the cerebrospinal fluid that had neuroprotective effects in experimental animals (57).

biotransformation and excretion
upon passage through the liver,  xxxd3435xxx  is deacetylated, forming htb as the main
active metabolite. in animals its excretion is mainly renal, with a urinary clearance of 60%
at 48 h after intake (43,44,49,52). in urine, free htb, glycine-conjugated htb, and an unidentified metabolite with greater polarity than htb (52) have been identified in addition
to unchanged  xxxd3435xxx .
the half-life of trifusal (900 mg p.o.) in healthy humans was found to be 0.5 ± 0.1 h,
while the half-life of htb was 34.3 ± 5.3 h. the cmax was 11.6 ± 1.6 ìg/ml for  xxxd3435xxx 
and 92.7 ± 17.1 ìg/ml for htb, renal clearance was 0.8 ± 0.2 l/h for  xxxd3435xxx  and 0.18 ±
0.04 l/h for htb, and tmax was 0.88 ± 0.26 h for  xxxd3435xxx  and 4.96 ± 1.37 h for htb. at
4 h after oral administration, plasma levels of  xxxd3435xxx  were undetectable (47–49). these
values illustrate the difference in plasma half-life between  xxxd3435xxx  (slightly longer than
30 min) and htb (nearly 35 h). in view of the antiplatelet activity of htb we will
comment below on some of the pharmacodynamic characteristics of this metabolite.
repeated doses of  xxxd3435xxx  (300 mg/8 h or 600 mg/12 h for 13 days) led to no significant difference in the area under the curve for plasma concentrations or plasma half-life
between single-dose and repeated dose regimens, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of
htb is linear. steady state for htb is reached after 8–10 days of treatment.

pharmacology
 xxxd3435xxx  has two major pharmacological effects: it affects platelet function and the
nervous tissue. in platelets it inhibits activation of thrombogenic mechanisms, while in the
nervous system it blocks the main biochemical pathways that lead to cell damage during
ischemia.

inhibition of platelet function
 xxxd3435xxx  inhibits platelet aggregation and interaction of platelets with subendothelium.
the antiplatelet effect of  xxxd3435xxx  has been documented in experimental animals and in
humans, in in vitro and ex vivo studies, and in in vivo models of thrombogenesis in animals (5,16–20,26,32).
the most direct experimental evidence of  xxxd3435xxx ’s antithrombotic effect comes from
studies in a model of brain ischemia induced by the intracarotid injection of arachidonic
acid to rats. these experiments showed a significant reduction in brain ischemia (caused
by formation of multiple small intravascular thrombi) after the chronic administration of
 xxxd3435xxx  (60% protection vs. 27% protection with an equivalent dose of asa) (32). other
methods have been also used to test the effect of drugs on thrombus formation in vivo. occlusion of brain arteries is followed by the formation of distal microthrombi. after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats,  xxxd3435xxx  (12.5 mg/kg orally) reduced microthrombus formation by 80%, whereas asa reduced this effect by 65% at a dose of
50 mg/kg orally, and by only 50% at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg. inhibition of the formation of
brain thrombi was also seen in rats after electrical stimulation of the carotid artery (38,39).

in humans  xxxd3435xxx  has been shown to have antiplatelet effects. it inhibited collagen- or
 xxxd208xxx -induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma more effectively than
adp-induced platelet aggregation. at 24 h after a single 900 mg dose of  xxxd3435xxx ,  xxxd208xxx -induced platelet aggregation was reduced by 44%, while the inhibition of platelet aggregation was nearly 100% after 3 days of treatment with this dose of  xxxd3435xxx . when
treatment was stopped, it took 8–10 days for platelet aggregation to recover (5). after 15
days of treatment in healthy volunteers with 600 mg/day of  xxxd3435xxx ,  xxxd208xxx -induced platelet aggregation was reduced by 74.9 ± 2.5% (16). similar results were obtained
in patients with diabetes (18,29).
aggregometry in platelet-rich plasma poses certain limitations to extrapolation of the
data obtained under in vivo conditions of platelet activation. to circumvent this drawback
and analyze platelet function in an environment that more closely replicates the blood
stream, a new method, electrical impedance aggregometry, was developed. the main advantage of this method is that it examines platelet function in the whole blood.  xxxd3435xxx 
has greater antiplatelet effect in whole blood in both healthy volunteers and patients with
diabetes. in healthy volunteers inhibition of platelet aggregation in blood was higher than
in platelet-rich plasma. even when adp was used to induce aggregation, the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd3435xxx  was 37 ± 3.7% after 15 days of treatment at 600 mg/day. such an effect
has not been reported for other  xxxd3159xxx  derivatives (18). in patients with diabetes
adp-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by 67.4 ± 1.1%, as compared to
46.1 ± 8.1% after treatment with asa at a dose of 400 mg/day (16,17).
different techniques have been used to study the effects of trifusal on the interactions
between circulating platelets and the arterial subendothelium, such as the baumgartner
perfusion chamber, in which blood circulates in contact with rabbit aorta subendothelium.
morphological analysis of the subendothelium can establish the percentage of platelets
adhered, and the percentage surface areas occupied by contacts (non-activated platelets),
adhesions (decreased camp levels) or aggregates (complete release of the granular contents and thromboxane synthesis). studies using this method showed that in healthy volunteers trifusal, at 600 mg/day, reduced the percentage of platelets retained in the sample by
90%, while at 400 mg/day asa reduced it by only 62%. the subendothelial surface occupied by aggregates was reduced by 89% with  xxxd3435xxx  and by 75% with asa. the most
notable finding was the reduction of the surface occupied by adhesions, 25% with  xxxd3435xxx 
versus only 3.2% with asa (19).

neuroprotective effect
independently of its antithrombotic effect,  xxxd3435xxx  acts directly on the nervous tissue to
reduce the damage caused by ischemic or cytotoxic insults. by oral administration at
30 mg/kg  xxxd3435xxx  reduced brain lesions caused by the intracerebral injection of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) (1,3). in addition, by chronic oral administration at 1, 10, or
50 mg/kg trifusal significantly reduced brain damage caused by anoxia-reoxygenation of
rat brain slices, diminishing the activity of ldh (an indirect indicator of brain cell death
in this experimental model) by 21, 42, and 47%, respectively (33).  xxxd234xxx 
had dose-dependent, but quantitatively lesser neuroprotective effect. at an antithrombotic
dose of 1 mg/kg/day p.o. aspirin did not significantly affect ldh activity, while  xxxd3435xxx ,
at the recommended antithrombotic dose of 10 mg/kg/day, inhibited ldh activity by
42%. similar differences between the two drugs were observed in their effects on the bio-

chemical pathways of brain damage (oxidative stress, prostaglandin accumulation and
 xxxd2738xxx  pathway, among others) (33).
studies of the neuroprotective effect of  xxxd3435xxx  and its metabolite htb consistently
showed that the effect of the latter is at least as intense, if not more so, than the effect of
 xxxd3435xxx , and that htb is consistently more effective than its  xxxd3159xxx  counterpart
(1,3,33,34).

mechanism of action
the effect of  xxxd3435xxx  on platelet aggregation and its neuroprotective effect are based on
separate but possibly interrelated mechanisms of action (fig. 2).

mechanism of platelet aggregation inhibitory activity
 xxxd3435xxx  irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (12,20) although its potency is lower
than that of asa. htb also inhibits cyclooxygenase, although its effect is weaker than
that of  xxxd3435xxx . however, unlike  xxxd3159xxx , htb potentiates the effect of  xxxd3435xxx  on
the enzyme.  xxxd3159xxx , on the other hand, has an antagonistic effect and competes with
asa for its binding to cyclooxygenase.

other activities have been also identified as potentially capable to complement the platelet aggregation inhibitory effect of  xxxd3435xxx :
1) htb-induced inhibition of platelet phosphodiesterase (ic50: 1 mm for htb and
5 mm for  xxxd3435xxx ) increases cytoplasmic levels of camp (30).
2) inhibition of vascular prostacyclin synthesis by  xxxd3435xxx  and htb (ic50: 339 ±
54 ìm for  xxxd3435xxx  and 4725 ± 523 ìm for htb). asa inhibits prostacyclin synthesis at
1000 times lower concentrations (ic50: 0.33 ± 0.05 ìm). the ic50 of htb for inhibition
of platelet aggregation in the whole blood was: 202 ± 15 ìm and of  xxxd3435xxx : 48.3 ±
3.3 ìm (20).
3) stimulation of the constitutive activity of no synthase (cnos) by trifusal and htb
and consequent increase in no production by endothelial cells and leucocytes.
this latter effect, together with the effects on prostacyclin synthesis and increased platelet camp levels, suggest that the platelet aggregation inhibitory effects of  xxxd3435xxx  and
htb may be mediated by the irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase.

mechanism of neuroprotective action
in the nervous tissue several sites of action of  xxxd3435xxx  and htb have been described
to account for the neuroprotective effect of these drugs. these sites of action are interrelated via biochemical pathways whose involvement in neuronal damage has been well
documented:
oxidative stress. in a model of brain anoxia-reoxygenation in rats,  xxxd3435xxx  and especially htb have a clear antioxidant effect. the antioxidant activity of  xxxd3435xxx  is qualitatively different from that of htb.  xxxd3435xxx  inhibits the excess lipid peroxidation that
results from anoxia-reoxygenation, while htb enhances the endogenous glutathione antioxidant system in addition to inhibiting lipid peroxidation (33,34).
accumulation of prostaglandins. by virtue of their cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity
 xxxd3435xxx  and htb decrease prostaglandin synthesis in brain tissue. the increase in prostaglandin synthesis that occurs as a result of brain anoxia-reoxygenation is inhibited by trifusal and htb to a greater extent than by asa (33).
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) pathway. excess production of no leads to formation of peroxynitrites, which are highly reactive radicals and neuronal toxins. as antioxidants,  xxxd3435xxx  and
htb substantially decrease the availability of free radicals. in addition, trifusal and htb
reduce the activity of  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) to a greater degree than asa
(33). this leads to reduction of the excessive formation of  xxxd2738xxx  by ischemic brain
tissue.
mediators of inflammation (fig. 3). the inhibition of inos activity by  xxxd3435xxx  is accompanied by inhibition of the inducible cyclooxygenase pathway (cox-2) (25), which is
activated in neurotoxic and neurodegenerative processes. this suggests that  xxxd3435xxx 
and/or htb may affect an upstream biochemical pathway involving mediators of tissue
inflammation. in fact, it was found that  xxxd3435xxx  and htb inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1â and tnfá in models of n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) neurotoxicity (1). this effects of  xxxd3435xxx  and htb appear to be mediated by inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b (nf-êb) synthesis and desensitization of neurons to the
effect of nf-êb (2,3,10,37). this antiinflammatory effect in brain tissue was recently proposed to be responsible for the  xxxd3435xxx -induced neuroprotection in an experimental model
of neurogegenerative diseases (59).

in summary,  xxxd3435xxx  and htb have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and to
have neuroprotective activity by acting on a number of biochemical pathways. these effects may be responsible for the prevention of clinical stroke by  xxxd3435xxx .

clinical efficacy
cerebrovascular diseases are the third most frequent cause of death in the usa. in
mediterranean countries, including spain, they constitute the most frequent cause of death
in women and the second most frequent cause of death in men (22).
although the treatment for acute stroke is well established, clinical trials continue to
provide new lines of evidence for the efficacy and safety of preventive therapy. the prevention of cerebral ischemia is currently based on the control and treatment of vascular
risk factors, inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients with atherothrombotic diseases of
small vessels, and oral anticoagulation in patients in prethrombotic state. carotid endarterectomy may be indicated in patients with atherothrombotic disease and more than 70%
stenosis. angioplasty can be used instead of surgery.

table 1 summarizes the major clinical trials with  xxxd3435xxx . the trials attempted to demonstrate prevention of cerebrovascular events by  xxxd3435xxx  as well as to evaluate its potential side effect, tendency to produce hemorrhage.

acute therapy
thrombolysis with  xxxd2925xxx  (rtpa) is the recommended therapy of acute cerebrovascular thrombosis and prompt treatment is of fundamental importance (4). continuous doppler transcranial monitoring in patients treated
with rtpa improves arterial recanalization rates. if brain hemorrhage can be ruled out,
asa, 300 mg, is recommended during the acute phase of cerebrovascular thrombosis
(53).
in general, the results of clinical trials with neuroprotective drugs have been negative
or have yielded low-quality evidence insufficient to recommend their routine use (4).
although neuroprotective activity of  xxxd3435xxx  has been shown in preclinical studies,
clinical trials to document this effect in humans have yet to be performed.

primary prevention
primary prevention of stroke is oriented toward modifiable or potentially modifiable
vascular risk factors, and is based on the use of antihypertensive (especially ace inhibitors) and anticoagulant drugs, which have been clearly demonstrated to be effective in the
therapy of cardioembolic stroke (31). antiplatelet drugs, particularly asa, have not been
found effective in primary prevention. moreover, these agents have been associated with
an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (35).
two recent studies compared trifusal alone or in combination with  xxxd59xxx  with
anticoagulant therapy alone in patients with atrial fibrillation. among the cardiopathies
likely to increase the risk of embolism, atrial fibrillation (af) is the most important risk
factor for stoke, that accounts for approximately half of all cardioembolic brain infarcts
(36).
the naspeaf study (national study for prevention of embolism in atrial fibrillation) (46) evaluated the efficacy of trifusal alone (600 mg/day),  xxxd59xxx  alone
(to maintain an international normalized ratio [inr] of 2–3) or  xxxd3435xxx  (600 mg/day) in
combination with  xxxd59xxx  (inr 1.25–2.4) in patients with chronic or paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. patients were randomized in this study depending on the risk of stroke as
intermediate risk (nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with no previous embolism) or high risk
(nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with antecedents of embolism or mitral stenosis with or
without previous embolism). all three treatment groups consisted of patients at intermediate risk, whereas in patients at high risk  xxxd59xxx  alone was compared with
 xxxd59xxx  in combination with  xxxd3435xxx . the primary study endpoint was a composite
of vascular death (occurring within 30 days after heart failure or a vascular event), transient ischemic attack (tia), nonfatal stroke or systemic embolism.
in the group of patients at intermediate risk the incidence of the primary endpoint was
significantly lower with the combined therapy than with  xxxd3435xxx  or  xxxd59xxx  alone
(0.92 vs. 3.82 vs. 2.70%, respectively, p < 0.05). in the group of patients at high risk,  xxxd3435xxx  in combination with  xxxd59xxx  significantly reduced rates of the primary endpoint (2.44 vs. 4.76%, p < 0.05).
another study compared the efficacy of  xxxd3435xxx  (600 mg/day) with that of  xxxd59xxx  (target inr 2–3) in patients who underwent valve replacement with a bioprosthetic

mitral or aortic valve. the principal endpoint of this study was thromboembolism, severe
hemorrhage or death related to valvular disease (9). there was no significant difference
between the two treatments in regard to the principal endpoint at 30 days after surgery.

secondary prevention
between 30% and 43% of all patients who have had a stroke will have a repeat episode
within the subsequent five years (41), and the risk is greatest during the first month following the first episode. likewise, the risk of cerebral infarction after a transient ischemic
attack (tia) is approximately 20% during the first month. patients with stroke or tia are
more likely to have an acute myocardial infarction or other vascular episode. for the
reasons explained above, secondary prevention is needed in these patients.
 xxxd234xxx  reduces the absolute risk of stroke, myocardial infarction or death
from vascular causes by 25% in comparison to placebo. in patients with antecedent stroke,
the risk of nonfatal stroke is reduced by 22% and that of vascular death by 14% (7).
however, a recent trial in women showed that asa (100 mg/day) reduced the risk of
stroke but not that of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (51). a recent metaanalysis of published studies established the dose of asa for antiplatelet therapy as
75–150 mg/day (8). although a number of studies have documented that lower doses of
asa appear to be effective and are unlikely to cause bleeding complications (23,24,56),
no clinical trials to date definitively demonstrated that lower doses of asa effectively
prevent cerebrovascular disease.
after publication of the clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients at risk of ischemic
events (caprie) study (11), the use of clopidogrel (antagonist of platelet adp receptors)
for the secondary prevention of stroke gained acceptance, especially in patients at high
risk for vascular events or in patients who tolerated asa poorly. combination of asa (inhibitor of platelet thromboxane pathway) and clopidogrel (antagonist of platelet adp receptor) has not been found to be superior to asa alone in the secondary prevention of
ischemic stroke in patients at high risk (21). moreover, this combination has been associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic adverse events than asa alone (60).
however, combination of asa with  xxxd1914xxx  (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) has been
found to be more effective in reducing stroke recurrence than monotherapy with either
drug (40).
two randomized, double-blind multicenter clinical trials of  xxxd3435xxx  compared to asa,
the tacip and tapirss studies (15,42), used as the principal endpoint a composite of
vascular death and nonfatal ischemic stroke. neither study demonstrated statistically significant differences between treatments in the principal endpoint. the incidence of significant vascular events was 12.4 to 28.8% in the group treated with asa, vs. 12.7 to 19.8%
in the group that received  xxxd3435xxx . however, patients treated with  xxxd3435xxx  had a lower incidence of hemorrhage (1.9–2.8 vs. 4.0–8.3%).
a recent meta-analysis (13) failed to detect any significant difference between  xxxd3435xxx 
and asa (odds ratio 1.02, 95% ci 0.83–1.26), except for a significant reduction in the risk
of fatal ischemic stroke in the group that received  xxxd3435xxx .
in long-term studies the efficacy of  xxxd3435xxx  was similar to that of asa, but the former
led to fewer bleeding complications (see below) (15,42).  xxxd3435xxx  can be, therefore, considered the antiplatelet drug of choice or an alternative to asa.

adverse reactions
the long-term administration of asa for the prevention and treatment of atherothrombosis in high-risk patients, even at low doses, increased the risk of severe extracranial
hemorrhage (mainly gastrointestinal bleeding) by approximately 50% (8,27). this is
equivalent to 1 or 2 severe hemorrhagic episodes per 1000 patients treated with low doses
of asa for 1 year, and 1–2 episodes of hemorrhagic stroke per 10,000 patients treated
(45). a meta-analysis of clinical trials that evaluated primary and secondary prophylaxis
with antiplatelet drugs showed an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients
treated with asa compared to placebo (odds ratio 2.8) (50). apparently, the presence of
hemorrhagic complications was related to the dose of asa, although this relationship was
not seen for intracranial bleeding, the risk of which appeared to be dose-independent (6).
information about the safety of  xxxd3435xxx , as compared to asa or  xxxd59xxx , comes
from four clinical trials and a meta-analysis. two trials (the tacip and tapirss studies)
involved patients with cerebral infarction (15,42), one trial (the naspeaf study) studied
 xxxd3435xxx  in thromboprophylaxis for atrial fibrillation (46) and one (the tim study) involved patients with myocardial infarction (14). the meta-analysis included clinical trials
in patients with stroke and myocardial infarction (13). in the clinical trials the rates of
withdrawal and the incidence of adverse events in patients treated with  xxxd3435xxx  did not
differ significantly from those for patients given asa.
 xxxd3435xxx  led to a significantly higher incidence of dyspepsia than asa, but to a lower
incidence of anemia and peptic ulcer (42). moreover, patients treated with  xxxd3435xxx  had a
lower risk of hemorrhage than those treated with asa (14,15,42,46).  xxxd3435xxx  was associated with significantly fewer episodes of cerebral hemorrhage (0.3% in patients treated
with  xxxd3435xxx  vs. 1.0% in patients treated with asa), and the reduction was also evident in
patients who received fibrinolytic therapy (14). the administration of  xxxd3435xxx  was associated with a significantly lower risk of severe hemorrhage in comparison to  xxxd59xxx  (inr 2–3) or to combination of the two drugs (inr 1.25–2.4); the incidence of this
event was 0.4, 1.8, and 0.9%, respectively, for each treatment (46).
the tapirss study showed that the bleeding was most commonly gastrointestinal,
and that the use of asa was associated with a greater risk of bleeding in comparison to
 xxxd3435xxx  (odds ratio 3.13, 95% ci 1.22–8.08) (15).
one of the findings of the meta-analysis by costa and colleagues was particularly notable. although the frequency of nonhemorrhagic adverse effects (abdominal pain, dyspepsia and peptic ulcer, among others) was significantly higher in patients treated with
 xxxd3435xxx , the incidence of hemorrhagic complications (fatal or nonfatal hemorrhagic
stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or severe systemic bleeding) was significantly lower than
in patients treated with asa (13).
because of concomitant conditions in patients with antecedent cerebral or cardiac
ischemia, antithrombotics are generally used together with other medications. this makes
it important to consider the possible interactions between drugs. unlike asa,  xxxd3435xxx  is
less likely to interfere with the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs (42), especially ace inhibitors (14,28). however, htb interacts with serum protein binding of various drugs to
the same degree as asa, so that precautions must be taken when trifusal is used in combination with anticoagulants (43,44).

final considerations
the adverse effects of antithrombotic therapy are often overlooked when medication is
chosen for the secondary prevention of stroke. however, the profile of adverse effects of
each drug needs to be considered, particularly with regard to gastrointestinal bleeding and
especially in older patients (58).
in comparison to asa,  xxxd3435xxx  is associated with a lower incidence of hemorrhagic
events. however, the dose of asa used in the studies reviewed here was higher than
300 mg/day, a dose substantially higher than currently recommended doses. there is,
therefore, a need for a clinical trial designed to compare the safety of  xxxd3435xxx  with that of
asa at currently recommended doses.
despite this reservation, we believe that  xxxd3435xxx  can play an important role in the antithrombotic therapy for stroke. its mechanism of action differs from that of asa and other
antiplatelet drugs, and this consideration, together with its potential neuroprotective effect
(demonstrated only in animal models) makes trifusal an attractive alternative to asa.
moreover, evidence published to date shows that the drug is both effective and safe.
 xxxd3435xxx  could thus be recommended for patients at high risk for hemorrhagic complications (especially older persons) and patients receiving fibrinolytic treatment. in addition,
 xxxd3435xxx  is a potentially attractive alternative for thromboembolic prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation in patients at moderate risk (as monotherapy or in combination with anticoagulants) or at high risk (in combination with anticoagulants). also, patients who are resistant
to asa may benefit by treatment with  xxxd3435xxx . additional clinical trials designed to test
the effectiveness of trifusal in different types of patients will be needed to determine the
place of  xxxd3435xxx  in the therapy or prevention of stroke and of other conditions associated
with brain ischemia.
