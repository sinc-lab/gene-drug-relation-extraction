anti-parkinsonian agents  xxxd3019xxx  and  xxxd2055xxx  alleviate thermal hyperalgesia in neuropathic rats.   xxxd3019xxx  and  xxxd2055xxx , widely used as anti-parkinsonian agents because of their anti-cholinergic action, are also known to have nmda antagonist properties. unlike other nmda antagonists, these agents-because of their anti-cholinergic action-are devoid of neurotoxic side effects. in the present study, we used a sciatic nerve ligation model that produces a hyperalgesic (neuropathic pain) state in adult rats to evaluate the ability of  xxxd3019xxx  or  xxxd2055xxx , either alone or in combination with an alpha(2) adrenergic agonist, to ameliorate neuropathic pain. we found that both  xxxd3019xxx  and  xxxd2055xxx  alleviated thermal hyperalgesia in a dose dependent manner; when a marginally effective dose of these agents was combined with an ineffective dose of an alpha(2) adrenergic agonist (clonidine or  xxxd2241xxx ), the combination therapy provided effective and long-lasting relief from neuropathic pain. in addition, the combination therapy was free from neurotoxic or behavioral side effects, and hyperactivity, a side effect associated with  xxxd3019xxx  monotherapy, was counteracted by clonidine.
