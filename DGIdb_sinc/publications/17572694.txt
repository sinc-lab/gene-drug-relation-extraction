background and purpose: stonefish (synanceia genus) are commonly found in shallow waters of the pacific and indian
oceans. the venom of stonefish is stored in the dorsal fine spines and contains a proteinaceous toxin, verrucotoxin (vtx). the
stings produced by the spines induce intense pain, respiratory weakness, damage to the cardiovascular system, convulsions
and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. although there are many studies on vtx, the mechanism(s) underlying the vtxmediated cardiotoxicity is not yet fully understood. the aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of ion channels in
cardiac tissue by vtx.
experimental approach: the effects of vtx on changes in the voltage or current in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes were
investigated using a patch clamp method.
key results: vtx (10 mg ml1) prolonged the action potential duration by 2.5-fold. vtx increased l-type ca2 þ currents (ica(l))
in a concentration-dependent manner with a ec50 value of 7 mg ml1 and a maximum increase of 3.1-fold. the non-selective
b-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mm) and the selective b1-adrenoceptor antagonist, cgp20712a (10 mm) each
abolished the effect of vtx (100 mg ml1) on ica(l). furthermore, the  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) antagonists  xxxd477xxx  (10 mm) and rp8-br-camps (30 mm) inhibited the effect of vtx on ica(l).
conclusions and implications: vtx modulates ca2 þ channel activity through the b-adrenoceptor-camp-pka pathway.

introduction
the stonefish synanceia verrucosa belongs to the genus
synanceia, which is commonly found in shallow waters of
the pacific and indian oceans. the venom of the stonefish is
a protein stored in the dorsal fine spines. the stings produced
by the spines induce intense pain, respiratory arrest, damage
to the cardiovascular system, convulsions and skeletal muscle
paralysis, sometimes leading to death (saunders, 1959; breton
et al., 2002; khoo, 2002). verrucotoxin (vtx), a tetrameric

glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 322 kda (garnier
et al., 1995), and a dimeric 166-kda protein (ueda et al., 2006)
have been isolated from the venom.
some previous studies have investigated the mechanism of
action of the venom or vtx on receptors and ion channels
(sauviat et al., 1995; garnier et al., 1997). at concentrations
below 3 mg ml1, the venom increased the peak contraction
of frog atrial fibres and this effect was suppressed by the
b-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (sauviat et al., 1995),
suggesting that vtx activates b-adrenoceptors. b-adrenoceptor stimulation is known to activate  xxxg1836xxx 
(pka) and phosphorylate ca2 þ channels, thereby increasing
the intracellular ca2 þ concentration. this increased intracellular ca2 þ concentration may provide one explanation
for the cardiac effects of vtx, as high concentrations of

k yazawa et al

ca2 þ can lead to arrhythmia or activate ca2 þ -activated
proteases. sauviat et al. (1995) also reported that crude
stonefish venom induces negative inotropic and chronotropic actions at concentrations above 5 mg ml1. the
mechanism underlying the biphasic actions of the venom
has not been fully elucidated. it has also been reported that
vtx may activate atp-sensitive potassium channels (garnier
et al., 1997). in addition, breton et al. (2002) reported that
vtx produces neurological disorders, including paralysis,
seizures and convulsions, that are not blocked by propranolol. thus, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of vtx
toxicity, especially its cardiotoxicity towards the mammalian
heart, have not yet been fully investigated. the aim of this
study was to elucidate the mechanism of the vtx-mediated
modulation of ion channels in guinea-pig ventricular
myocytes using a patch–clamp method. the results show
that vtx modulates ca2 þ channel activity through the
b-adrenoceptor–camp–pka pathway.

methods
animals and cell preparation
this study was conducted in accordance with the guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us
national institutes of health (nih publication no. 85–23,
revised 1996). in addition, the committee on animal
experimentation, kagoshima university, japan, granted
permission for the study.
single ventricular cells were obtained from adult guinea-pig
hearts using an enzymatic dissociation method (yazawa et al.,
1990). briefly, the guinea-pigs were anaesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (50 mg kg1, intraperitoneally) and the hearts
were removed. each heart was then mounted on a langendorff apparatus and perfused with nominally ca2 þ -free
tyrode solution containing collagenase (0.08%; yakult, japan)
at 371c. after 10 min of collagenase treatment, the enzyme
solution was washed with a storage solution (see below). the
ventricle was then cut into pieces, and the dispersed cells were
maintained in the storage solution at 41c until use.

solutions
the compositions of the external solutions were as follows:
the control tyrode solution contained (in mm): nacl, 135;
kcl, 5.4; cacl2, 1.8; mgcl2, 1.0; nah2po4, 0.33; hepes, 10.0;
glucose, 5.5; adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh. the ca2 þ -free
tyrode solution was made by omitting cacl2 from the
standard tyrode solution.
the storage solution contained (in mm): koh, 70; kcl, 40;
l- xxxd2431xxx , 50; taurine, 20; kh2po4, 20; mgcl2, 3;
glucose, 10; hepes, 10; egta, 0.5; adjusted to ph 7.2 with
koh.
the pipette solution for measurement of action potentials
and currents contained (in mm): k-aspartate, 110; kcl, 20;
mgcl2, 5; k2atp, 5; k2crp, 5; hepes, 5; egta, 10; cacl2, 1.43
(pca 8); adjusted to ph 7.2 with koh.
a stock solution of 8-bromoadenosine 30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphorothioate, rp-isomer (rp-8-br-camps), was prepared
in distilled water, stored at 201c and added to the pipette

solution at appropriate concentrations before use. a stock
solution of propranolol was prepared in distilled water, stored
at 41c and dissolved in tyrode solution before use. stock
solutions of  xxxd477xxx , nifedipine and [2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluormethyl2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]- xxxd2400xxx  methanesulphonate
(cgp20712a) were prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso)
and diluted 1000-fold in the perfusion solution (final
concentration of dmso: 0.1%). these drugs were purchased
from sigma-aldrich (st louis, mo, usa).

electrophysiological experiments
the whole-cell clamp technique used was essentially the
same as that described by hamill et al. (1981). a tight seal
was established on a cell superfused with tyrode solution,
and the perfusate was then changed to the test solution. the
resistance of the pipette filled with the internal solution was
2–4 mo. the voltage drop across the pipette resistance was
electrically compensated. data were recorded with a patch–
clamp amplifier (cez-2300; nihon koden, japan) filtered at
1 khz, and fed to a computer at a sampling rate of 1 khz. all
experiments were performed at 20–221c.

separation of crude venom
specimens of synanceia verrucosa (2.5–3.2 kg) originating
from okinawa island, japan, were maintained alive in a fish
tank in our laboratory. the stonefish were anaesthetized
with 0.04% phenoxyethanol in seawater and then decapitated to dissect the dorsal spines at their bases. the
integument sheath and tissue residing in the grooves of the
spines were removed and extracted with 150 mm nacl. after
centrifugation at 3000 g for 20 min, the resulting supernatant
was immediately lyophilized and stored at 801c until use.
the yield of crude venom was 18–24 mg kg1 fish. the
venom was diluted in tris (25 mm)-glycine (192 mm) buffer,
ph 8.4. the purity of vtx was evaluated by sds-page and
found to be 40–50%. the freeze-dried powder was dissolved
in tyrode solution on the day of the experiments.

statistical analysis
the results are expressed as means7s.e.m. statistical significance was determined by student’s t-test for paired data.
p-values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

results
effect of vtx on action potentials
we evaluated the effect of vtx on the action potentials of
guinea-pig ventricular cells. in the experiment shown in
figure 1, the action potentials were recorded under the
whole-cell patch–clamp condition. vtx (10 mg ml1) prolonged the action potential duration (apd) in a reversible
manner (figure 1, inset). the apd25, apd50 and apd90
values, representing the duration for 25, 50 and 90%
repolarization, respectively, increased from 204757 to
6767152 ms, from 305786 to 8337187 ms and from

347777 to 8677194 ms (po0.05), respectively (n ¼ 4). the
resting membrane potential (rmp) was not changed (from
84.070.8 to 82.070.6 mv; po0.1, n ¼ 4). on the other
hand, vtx (10 mg ml1) had no effect on the action potential
amplitude (125.074.5 vs 121.674.3 mv, n ¼ 4).

the action potential. therefore, we examined the effects of
vtx on ica(l) and other currents. the pca in the pipette was
fixed at 8, since ica(l) was reported to be modulated by the
intracellular calcium concentration (wu et al., 2001; lindegger and niggli, 2005). in the experiment shown in figure 2a,
superimposed currents were obtained by applying 500-ms
hyperpolarizing or depolarizing pulses from 40 mv, for
blocking sodium channel activity, to 20, 0 and 20 mv for
the upper panel and 140, 120 and 100 mv for the lower
panel at a rate of 10 s in the absence (left row), presence
(middle row) or wash out (right row) of 100 mg ml1 vtx.
the current to voltage (i–v) relationships in the control
sample and in the presence of 100 mg ml1 vtx are
illustrated in figure 2b. the increased inward currents were
blocked by 3 mm nifedipine, showing that the currents were
ica(l) (data not shown). vtx increased ica(l) and shifted the
negative slope region of ica(l) in the hyperpolarizing
direction. these effects of vtx were reversible and reproducible. although vtx increased the delayed outward k þ
currents at positive potentials (440 mv), these potentials
were scarcely involved in the main plateau phase for apd
prolongation (figure 1). vtx also slightly depolarized
the rmp (figure 1). to investigate the effect of vtx on
the inward rectifier k þ currents ( xxxg1160xxx   xxxg1267xxx ) that contributed to the
rmp, 100 mg ml1 vtx, a sub-maximum concentration for
ica(l) enhancement, was applied. vtx decreased  xxxg1160xxx   xxxg1267xxx  by
18.8710.2% (p ¼ 0.06, n ¼ 4) at 40 mv, a potential close
to the equilibrium potential of cl. this result indicates that
no statistical difference in the currents was observed at that
concentration. as a consequence, the subsequent experiments were mainly confined to studying the effects of vtx
on ica(l).
to confirm that the effects observed above were produced
by a venom protein, we examined the effect of vtx after
heating at 701c for 3 min, a condition known to denature

proteins, on ica(l). as shown in figure 3, heated vtx failed to
modulate ica(l), whereas ica(l) was increased by non-heated
vtx. on the other hand, noradrenaline (1 mm) heated under
the same conditions increased ica(l). these results were
further confirmed in four other cells and strongly support
the assumption that the increase in ica(l) was produced by
the venom protein vtx.
since the enhancement of ica(l) by vtx was notable in
figures 2 and 3, we examined the onset of the increase and
inactivation time course of ica(l) during the application of
vtx. in the experiment shown in figure 4, ica(l) was
recorded at 0 mv from a holding potential of 40 mv, with
a duration of 500 ms. ica(l) started to increase within 30 s

inactivation (figure 4, inset), consistent with the effect
produced by b-adrenergic stimulation.
next, we examined the concentration dependence of the
effects of vtx. ica(l) was measured upon depolarization from
40 to 0 mv at various concentrations of vtx and normalized to the values obtained in the absence of vtx. the
concentration–response relationship thus obtained is shown
in figure 5. the continuous curve represents the best fit of
the data using the hill equation with a hill coefficient of 1.
the threshold concentration of vtx for increasing ica(l) was
close to 1 mg ml1 and the maximum effect was obtained at
approximately 100 mg ml1. the normalized response of ica(l)
to 100 mg ml1 vtx was 3.1170.75 (n ¼ 4), and the halfmaximum concentration (ec50) was 8.5 mg ml1.
crude stonefish venom has been reported to activate
b-adrenoceptors in frog atrial fibres (sauviat et al., 1995).
to investigate whether the effect of vtx on ica(l) is mediated
by b-adrenoceptors, we examined the effect of propranolol, a
b-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the enhancement of ica(l) by
vtx (figure 6). although ica(l) tended to decline following
application of propranolol (1 mm), no clear enhancement of
ica(l) by vtx (10 or 100 mg ml1) was observed. b1-adrenoceptors, but not b2-adrenoceptors, are present on guinea-pig
ventricular myocytes. to clarify whether the effect of vtx on
ica(l) was mediated by b1-adrenoceptors, we examined
whether the b1-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp20712a suppressed the effect of vtx on ica(l). in the presence of
cgp20712a (10 mm), vtx (10 mg ml1) did not increase ica(l)
and the normalized current amplitude was 1.0570.04
(n ¼ 5). these results suggest that the effect of vtx on ica(l)
was mediated by b1-adrenoceptor stimulation.
the b1-adrenergic cascade has also been reported to
involve camp-dependent pka activation and phosphorylation of a substrate protein (endoh, 2006). therefore, we
examined whether vtx was able to increase ica(l) in the

mediated by vtx (8 mg ml1; approximately the ec50 value)
was markedly suppressed by  xxxd477xxx  (10 mm). the normalized
current amplitude was 1.0870.06 (n ¼ 4). since  xxxd477xxx  was
reported to have a b-adrenoceptor antagonistic effect (penn
et al., 1999), we also examined the effect of rp-8-br-camps,
another pka inhibitor without an adrenoceptor antagonistic
effect. the increased ica(l) mediated by vtx (8 mg ml1) was
markedly suppressed by rp-8-br-camps (30 mm). the normalized current amplitude was 1.0570.01 (n ¼ 4). these results
suggest that the effect of vtx on ica(l) was mediated by pka
stimulation via b1-adrenoceptors.

discussion
the major findings of the present study are as follows:
(1) vtx causes prolongation of the apd, with no change in
the rmp, in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes; (2) vtx
increases ica(l) in a concentration-dependent manner; and
(3) the effect of vtx on ica(l) is prevented by b-adrenoceptor
antagonists or pka inhibitors. taken together, these results
suggest that vtx modulation of ion channels is mediated by
the b-adrenoceptor–camp–pka pathway.
garnier et al. (1996) reported that stonefish venom
contains noradrenaline, and it was therefore possible that
residual noradrenaline in our venom may have modulated
the ion channels in our myocytes. however, we were able to
exclude this possibility because the effect of the venom on
ica(l) was inactivated by moderate heating at 701c for 3 min,
which is known to denature proteins, whereas noradrenaline
heated under the same conditions actually increased ica(l).
stonefish venom is able to induce positive inotropic and
chronotropic effects at concentrations below 3 mg ml1 and
has a negative inotropic effect and induces contractures at
concentrations above 5 mg ml1 (sauviat et al., 1995). these
results suggest that the venom has several characteristics for
modulating cardiac functions (for example, receptor modulation or direct actions on channels). however, the ionic
basis of these actions of the venom was not extensively
british journal of pharmacology (2007) 151 1198–1203

investigated in previous studies (sauviat et al., 1995; garnier
et al., 1996). in the current study, we examined the effects of
vtx on ion channels under the whole-cell clamp condition
in single myocytes. we found that ica(l) is modulated by vtx
through activation of b-adrenoceptors. there are several
similarities between vtx and b-adrenoceptor agonists
in their electrophysiological effects on cardiac ion channels:
(1) vtx increased ica(l) in a concentration-dependent manner
up to threefold, similar to the findings for isoproterenolinduced increases in ica (kameyama et al., 1985) and ik
(yazawa and kameyama, 1990); (2) the concentration–
response relationship for vtx (figure 5) showed a slope
factor of b1, similar to that for  xxxd2401xxx  vs ica
(kameyama et al., 1985); and (3) the current–voltage
relationship for ica(l) was shifted by vtx in the negative
direction (figure 2), is similar to the finding for  xxxd2401xxx 
vs ica(l) (findlay, 2002). in addition, the effect of vtx on
these currents was blocked by the b1-adrenoceptor antagonist cgp20712a and pka inhibitors  xxxd477xxx  and rp-8-brcamps. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that
vtx acts as a b1-adrenoceptor agonist and modulates ica(l)
through activation of the camp–pka pathway.
as vtx elicits contractures, it may have some additional
actions, because extensive b-adrenergic stimulation does not
generally induce contractures in cardiac muscle, due to the
activation of serca2a. it has also been reported that vtx may
activate the atp-sensitive potassium channels in frog atrial
muscle (garnier et al., 1997). although we did not observe such
an effect, we cannot rule out this possibility, because the
pipette solution was supplemented with atp and the atpsensitive potassium channels were therefore continuously
blocked. thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the
effects of vtx on other ion channels and transporters.
there are many toxins that act through receptor-mediated
stimulation. for example, crotalus durissus terrificus snake
venom was reported to induce anti-nociception mediated by
opioid receptors (giorgi et al., 1993). more recently, this
snake venom was shown to activate atp-sensitive potassium
channels by way of opioid receptors (picolo et al., 2003).
thus, these studies suggest that some macromolecules
derived from natural resources have the ability to stimulate
g protein-coupled receptors.
vtx is a 322-kda glycoprotein composed of two a subunits
(83 kda) and two b subunits (78 kda). the cdna for the vtx
b-subunit has been inferred from the presence of an identical
n-terminal sequence and 96% homology to a partial
sequence (506 amino acids) of the stonustoxin b-subunit
from synanceia horrida, which also has cardiovascular effects
(ghadessy et al., 1994). recently, neovtx, a dimeric 166-kda
protein, was purified from synanceia verrucosa and its
character differs considerably from that of vtx. the
sequence identity between the neovtx b-subunit and the
previously reported vtx b-subunit is 90% (ueda et al., 2006).
the effect of neovtx on cardiac function has not yet been
identified. from our present findings, we suggest that a
macromolecule within stonefish venom, such as vtx or
neovtx, can act as a b1-adrenoceptor agonist.
in the present study, vtx was found to activate ica(l)
through b1-adrenoceptor activation. to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report to describe that vtx may

verrucotoxin modulates cardiac calcium channels
k yazawa et al

act as a b-adrenoceptor agonist through the camp–pka
pathway. unfortunately, the amino-acid sequences of the
a-subunit and the binding region to b-adrenoceptors have
not yet been clarified and future studies should address these
interesting issues.
