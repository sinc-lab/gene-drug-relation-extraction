summary brain cyclooxygenases (cox), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin
synthesis, is rapidly and transiently induced by convulsions in hippocampal and
cortical neurons. previous studies have explored the protective effect of naproxen
(non-selective cox-inhibitor) or rofecoxib (selective cox-2 inhibitor) against chemical kindling in mice. with this background, the present study was designed to explore
the possible effect of  xxxd2727xxx  (a preferential cox-2 inhibitor) against pentylenetetrazol (ptz)-induced kindling epilepsy in mice. to induce kindling, ptz was injected
in a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 15 days.  xxxd2727xxx  (2.5
or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered each day 45 min before either ptz or vehicle
challenge. the intensity of kindling was assessed immediately after ptz administration according to a prevalidated scoring scale. on 16th day i.e. 24 h after the last dose
of ptz, animals were sacrificed and various biochemical parameters were assessed in
the whole brain. compared with normal control group, ptz-kindled mice had significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, nitrite, myeloperoxidase but had lower
levels of  xxxd2213xxx  in the whole brain homogenate. chronic treatment with
 xxxd2727xxx  (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in kindling
score and could play a role in controlling the accompanying biochemical alterations
due to ptz. these results suggested that  xxxd2727xxx , a preferential cox-2 inhibitor
offered neuroprotection against ptz-induced kindling in mice.

introduction
cyclooxygenase (cox) is a rate-limiting enzyme,
which catalyzes the metabolism of  xxxd208xxx 
to prostaglandins (pgs) and exists as two isoforms
i.e., cox-1 and cox-2. cox-2 is often referred to as
the inducible isoform of cox, as levels of cox-2
increase in response to several forms of stimulation
in various types of tissue. in contrast, the constitutive form of cox, cox-1, appears to be involved in
housekeeping cellular functions.1 recent evidences
have found the up-regulation of cox particularly
cox-2 isoform in various neurological disorders,
including stroke, alzheimerâ€™s, and epilepsy.2 the
functional significance of these enzymes in the
mammalian central nervous system is now being
actively explored, particularly in these neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric situations. studies
have suggested the increased expression of cox-2
isoform in the mouse brain exactly after electrical
kindling.3,4 the expression of cox-2 is known to
increase in the granule and the pyramidal cells of
the hippocampus (the brain area that participates in
seizure generation) following kindling.3 studies with
celecoxib, a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor, have
shown beneficial effects when given in combination
with phenytoin (a standard anti-epileptic drug)
against electroshock-induced convulsions.5 in a
recent study from our laboratory, we have established the neuroprotective action of naproxen, a
non-selective cox-inhibitor in experimental epilepsy,6 possibly due to inhibition of cox-2 isoform
rather than cox-1 isoform.7 in another study, the
protective effect of  xxxd2727xxx  against an acute
effect of ptz-induced convulsions was demonstrated.8 the antiepileptic action of  xxxd2727xxx  is
still arguable, but is speculated to work through
enhancing the g-amino butyric acid (gaba) neurotransmission.8 with this background, the present
study was designed to expound the effect of  xxxd2727xxx , a preferential cox-2 inhibitor, following ptzinduced kindling epilepsy and the different biochemical parameters associated with kindling were
also investigated.

materials and methods
animals
male albino mice (laka strain) weighing 22â€”30 g bred
in central animal house (cah) facility of panjab
university, chandigarh, were used. the animals were
housed under standard laboratory conditions and
maintained on natural light and dark cycle (lights
on at 07:00 h) and had free access to food and water.

a. dhir et al.
animals were acclimatized to laboratory conditions
before the experiment. each animal was used only
once. all the experiments were carried out between
09:00 and 15:00 h. the experimental protocols were
approved by institutional animal ethics committee
(iaec) and conducted according to the indian
national science academy (insa) guidelines for the
use and care of experimental animals.

chemical kindling in mice
pentylenetetrazol (ptz) was administered in a subconvulsant dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.) on alternate days
for a total period of 15 days. after each injection of
ptz, occurrence of central nervous system (cns)
excitation was noted for 10â€”15 min by observing the
animals in a plexiglass chamber (30 cm  24 cm 
22 cm). the intensity of behavioral seizures was
evaluated using a scoring scale as described below:





0 = no seizures;
1 = jerks;
2 = straubâ€™s tail;
3 = clonic convulsions.

cumulative kindling score (calculated by taking
the average of all the individual behavioral scores
and then dividing them with the number of animals)
was plotted against the duration of treatment.6,9,10
the degree of behavioral response increased progressively over the days until the animals exhibited
full motor seizures.
the following treatment groups were included:
 group 1: vehicle, p.o. (0.25%, w/v cmc) (daily for
15 days) + saline, i.p. (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th,
11th, 13th and 15th days).
 group 2: vehicle, p.o. (0.25%, w/v cmc) (daily for
15 days) + ptz, i.p. (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th,
13th and 15th days).
 group 3:  xxxd2727xxx  2.5 mg/kg, p.o. (daily for 15
days) + saline, i.p. (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th,
13th and 15th days).
 group 4:  xxxd2727xxx  5 mg/kg, p.o. (daily for 15
days) + saline, i.p. (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th,
13th and 15th days).
 group 5:  xxxd2727xxx  2.5 mg/kg, p.o. (daily for 15
days) + ptz, i.p. (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th,
13th and 15th days).
 group 6:  xxxd2727xxx  5 mg/kg, p.o. (daily for 15
days) + ptz, i.p. (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th,
13th and 15th days).
on 16th day animals were sacrificed and the brains
were removed for carrying out various biochemical
estimations. each group contains 6â€”8 animals.

 xxxd2727xxx  in epilepsy

drugs
the drugs used in the present study were obtained
from the following drug houses: ptz (sigma, usa),
 xxxd2727xxx  (panacea biotech ltd., india). ptz was
dissolved in normal saline and administered intraperitoneally.  xxxd2727xxx  was suspended in 0.25%
(w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (cmc) and administered orally 45 min before the injection of either
ptz or saline.

dissection and homogenization
on the 16th day of the study i.e. 24 h after the last
dose of ptz, animals were sacrificed by decapitation. the whole brain was removed, rinsed in isotonic saline and weighed. a 10% (w/v) tissue
homogenate was prepared with 0.1 m phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4). the post nuclear fraction was
obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at
12,000  g for 20 min, at 4 8c for enzyme assays.

lipid peroxidation assay
the quantitative measurement of lipid peroxidation
in the whole brain was done according to the method
of wills.11 the amount of malondialdehyde (mda)
formed was measured by the reaction with thiobarbituric acid at 532 nm using perkin-elmer lambda 20
spectrophotometer. the results were expressed as
nmol of mda/mg protein using the molar extinction
coefficient of chromophore (1.56  10 m 1 cm 1).

693
temperature for 10 min to yield a chromophore.
absorbance was read at 543 nm spectrophotometrically. the nitrite concentration was calculated from a
standard curve and expressed as micromolar per
milliliter.

myeloperoxidase activity
myeloperoxidase activity was determined by modified technique of bird et al.14 the supernatant
collected was mixed with o-phenylenediamine
(660 mg/ml in phosphate buffer) and 300 mm h2o2
was added to it initiate the reaction. absorbance
was measured at 492 nm at an interval of 30 s for
2 min. change in optical density/minute was calculated and results were expressed as % myeloperoxidase activity considering 100% myeloperoxidase
activity in the control group.

protein estimation
the protein content was measured according to the
method of lowry using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
standard.15

statistical analysis
results are expressed as mean  s.e.m. the significance of the difference in the responses between
treatment groups and control was determined by
one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by
dunnettâ€™s test. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

estimation of  xxxd2213xxx 
 xxxd2213xxx  in the whole brain was estimated according to the method of ellman.12 a
0.75 ml of homogenate was precipitated with
0.75 ml of 4% sulfosalicylic acid. the samples were
centrifuged at 1200  g for 15 min at 4 8c, the assay
mixture containing 0.5 ml of supernatant and 4.5 ml
of 0.01 m dtnb. the yellow color developed was
read immediately at 412 nm using perkin-elmer
lambda 20 spectrophotometer. the results were
expressed as nmol gsh per mg protein.

nitrite estimation
nitrite is the stable end product of no in vitro system.
accumulation of nitrite was measured in cell-free
supernatants from brain homogenate by spectrophotometer assay based on greiss reaction.13 briefly,
the supernatant of brain homogenate was mixed with
equal volume of greiss reagent (1% sulphanilamide/
0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride/
2.5% phosphoric acid) and incubated at room

results
effect of  xxxd2727xxx  (2.5 or 5 mg/kg p.o.)
on ptz-induced kindling in mice
repeated treatment of subconvulsive dose of ptz
(40 mg/kg, i.p.) on alternate days for a period of 15
days induced kindling in mice as revealed by progressive increase in kindling score. as can be
depicted from fig. 1, group 2 (vehicle + ptz)
showed the maximum kindling score on day 15. daily
treatment with  xxxd2727xxx  (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.)
(groups 5 and 6) before ptz for 15 days showed a
decrease in the mean kindling score (assessed on day
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 of the treatment) as
compared to only ptz control group (group 2)
(fig. 1).  xxxd2727xxx  decreased the mean kindling
score on the 1st day of ptz administration, suggesting that the basal levels of brain cyclooxygenase
plays an important role in the initiation of the first
seizure (fig. 1).

due to ptz-induced kindling thus providing for the
first evidence regarding its beneficial effects as a
neuroprotective agent in epilepsy.  xxxd2727xxx  is
reported to be highly selective against ovine cox2 enzyme, and at the concentrations attained in
vivo, it has little effects on cox-1 enzyme.16 the
dose of  xxxd2727xxx  was chosen according to our
previous studies,  xxxd2727xxx  at a dose of 2 mg/kg
was found to be effective in inhibiting prostaglandins synthesis in brain.8,17
kindling is a model of epilepsy and epileptogenesis. the repeated administration of a subconvulsant dose of ptz, a blocker of gabaa receptor
mediated cl channel18 produced a progressive
increase in convulsant activity, culminating in a
generalized seizures (chemical kindling) in animals.19 ptz-induced kindling is an experimental
model of epilepsy that shares many features in
common with electrical limbic kindling.20
the presence of prostaglandins in the mammalian
brain is well-documented21 and prostaglandins are
either directly or indirectly involved with neuronal
activity.22 a role of prostaglandins in seizures has
been reported, some being anticonvulsants while
the others proconvulsants. increased levels of  xxxg1073xxx 
and pge2 following ptz-induced seizures have been
reported.3  xxxd124xxx  and pge2 have excitatory effects on
the cerebral cortex, the area that plays an important role in the onset of seizure activity.  xxxd1902xxx  is the
predominant prostaglandin identified in the experimentally induced as well as spontaneous seizure
activity.23 it has been hypothetized that cox-inhibitors are neuroprotective against ptz-induced convulsions possibly acting via inhibiting the synthesis of
various proconvulsive prostaglandins. also pge2,
which is preferentially formed during the activity
of cox-2 rather than cox-1, could participate
through several mechanisms, including modulation
of glutamatergic neurotransmission.24 similarly, a

significantly higher level of cox-2 and prostaglandins
were reported in ipsilateral cerebral cortex following
kainic acid-induced convulsions,25 revealing the significant local effect of kainic acid toxicity. inhibition
of pg synthesis by using cox-inhibitors following
brain injury has been reported as neuroprotective
in experimental studies of focal ischemia in rats,
concussive brain injury in cats, preconcussioninduced neurotrauma in rats and in clinical neurosurgery.26
in an earlier study carried out in our laboratory, we
have shown that  xxxd2727xxx  is protective in acute
model of ptz-induced convulsions in mice, possibly
through its modulatory action on gabaergic neurotransmission.  xxxd2727xxx  increased the effect of diazepam or muscimol (gabaa agonists) and the effect
was sensitive to reversal by flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist).8 in another study,  xxxd2727xxx  was found to be neuroprotective in a model of
transient focal cerebral ischemia, which showed that
the drug was able to significantly reduce infarct
volume and improve functional recovery. these neuroprotective effects were also observed when treatment is delayed until even 24 h after the onset of
ischemia.27 therefore, these studies support the role
of  xxxd2727xxx  as neuroprotectant.
in the present study,  xxxd2727xxx  (groups 5 and 6)
reversed kindling phenomenon in mice indicating
the possibility of involvement of cox isoforms.
because  xxxd2727xxx  is effective in reversing the
kindling seizures, it may be speculated that the
cox-2 isoform is involved in the seizure paradigm.
it is hypothesized that cox enzyme induction leads
to an increase in various prostaglandins, particularly
pge2, which may facilitate the release of glutamate
from the nerve terminal and astrocytes.28 activation of cox may also lead to an increase in the free
radical production leading to oxidative stress, followed by apoptosis of gabaergic neurons, ending in
an epileptic discharges. in the present study,  xxxd2727xxx  partially reduced the ptz-induced kindling
score, and thus suggesting the involvement of other
receptor mechanisms in ptz-induced kindling.
further,  xxxd2727xxx  decreased the mean kindling
score on the 1st day of ptz administration, suggesting that the basal levels of brain cyclooxygenase
plays an important role in the initiation of the first
seizure.
there is little evidence that free radicals are
actively involved in the physiological processes during oxidative stress induced by convulsants.29 of all
the free radicals that can occur in vitro, the hydroxyl free radicals (oh) are considered to be the most
reactive and hazardous.10  xxxg1884xxx  is an
essential enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis from
 xxxd208xxx , during which considerable amount

696
of superoxide ions are produced. during pathological
conditions, superoxides and  xxxd2738xxx  (no) rapidly
form peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxin, causing
symptoms referred to as oxidative stress response.30
therefore, it was hypothesized that the inhibition of
the cox-isoforms by using various cox-inhibitors
could prevent ptz-induced oxidative stress.
previous studies have shown that both the administration of ptz dose that induces acute seizures and
the dose that induces kindling seizures in animals
are associated with increase in the extracellular
glutamate levels. one source of oh radicals is
the peroxy nitrite (onoo ), which is generated
by the spontaneous reaction of o2  and no. when
no synthesis is enhanced .the formation of oh  is
favored strongly thus initiating the process of lipid
peroxidation and formation of protein adducts,
which induces cell damage.31 myeloperoxidase
(mpo) activity is indicative of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes recruitment in the brain.
in our study, there was an increase in the brain
malondialdehyde levels (indicator of the lipid peroxidation due to free radicals) and thus formation of
free radicals due to pentylenetetrazol and furthermore  xxxd2727xxx  reversed this increase in lipid peroxidation levels.  xxxd2727xxx  also attenuated the
increased nitrite levels due to chronic pentylenetetrazol challenge and reversed the decrease reduced
glutathione levels suggesting the free radical
scavenging potential of  xxxd2727xxx . further, pretreatment with  xxxd2727xxx  also reversed the ptzinduced increase in brain myeloperoxidase activity,
thus confirming the hypothesis that the protective
effect of  xxxd2727xxx  against pentylenetetrazolinduced chemical kindling in mice is possibly via
the free radical scavenging property of the drug.
