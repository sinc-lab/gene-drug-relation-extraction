objective  xxxg99xxx -receptor blockers are an
established class of antihypertensive agents, but the
differences between individual members of the class are
largely unknown. the present study employed an animal
model to demonstrate  xxxg99xxx -receptor blockerspecific effects and to quantify these differences by
comparing two common agents, losartan and  xxxd3487xxx .
methods we measured the effects on  xxxg99xxx   xxxg101xxx -mediated renal cgmp by microdialysis in the
outer renal cortex in conscious normotensive, sodiumdepleted, 4-week-old sprague–dawley rats. rats (n ¼ 8)
were given equimolar and equidepressor doses of losartan
(0.02 mmol/kg) or  xxxd3487xxx  (0.02 mmol/kg) either
intravenously or orally. time was allowed for the
conversion of losartan into its active metabolite, exp 3174.
results both drugs had equal effects on blood pressure.
there were significantly greater increases in cgmp levels
after administration of  xxxd3487xxx  than of losartan with both
routes of administration. intravenous administration of
 xxxd3487xxx  led to a 69.1% increase in cgmp, versus a 10.3%
increase with losartan. five hours after oral administration
of  xxxd3487xxx , a 48% increase in cgmp was observed versus
a 10.9% increase with losartan. the increase after oral
administration of  xxxd3487xxx  was sustained 8 h after
administration, whereas the effect of losartan was not

introduction
the renin–angiotensin system constitutes a major hormonal cascade regulating fluid and electrolyte balance and
blood pressure, the principal effector of which is  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii). the actions of ang ii are mediated by
several receptors, the most important of these being the
subtype-1 (at1 ) and subtype-2 ( xxxg101xxx  ) receptors [1–3].
the vast majority of the physiological effects of ang ii are
mediated by the at1 -receptor, including vasoconstriction
and sodium retention. the development of specific ang
ii at1 -receptor blockers (arbs) such as losartan and
 xxxd3487xxx  has led to major improvements to the treatment
of hypertension, with reported high efficacy and low
incidence of adverse events, mostly related to the  xxxg100xxx  blockade [4–6].
in contrast, the function of the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor has not

sustained. the effects of losartan and  xxxd3487xxx  on cgmp
were completely inhibited by  xxxg101xxx  -receptor blockade.
conclusion the results indicate that at1 -receptor
blockade with  xxxd3487xxx  influences  xxxg101xxx  -receptor-mediated
 xxxg99xxx  responses to a greater extent than with
losartan, as quantified by renal interstitial fluid cgmp.

been as thoroughly investigated, in part because of its
lower density and organ-specific distribution. the signalling mechanisms of the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor include gprotein coupling, cgmp [ xxxd2738xxx  (no)] generation,
and activation of several phosphatases [7–9].  xxxg101xxx  stimulation leads to bradykinin-mediated no
release, vasodilation, apoptosis and inhibition of cell
proliferation. some cardiovascular therapeutic effects of
at1 -receptor blockade, such as decreases in left ventricular remodelling and improvements in cardiac function, are clearly mediated by the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor and by
kinin stimulation [10,11].
recent in vivo studies on the effects of the  xxxg101xxx  in the kidney indicate that the stimulation of
the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor increases renal medullary and cortical
interstitial cgmp by a bradykinin-dependent mechan-

ism [12–15]. similar observations were made by
gohlke et al. [16] in the aorta of stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rats infused with ang ii.
in view of the increasing knowledge of  xxxg101xxx  -receptormediated benefits, recognition has grown that the
specific characteristics of different arbs may influence
their clinical effects. one such parameter is the degree
of blockade of the at1 -receptor. at1 -receptor blockade
would inhibit the ang ii regulatory mechanism in the
juxtaglomerular cells and increase renin and ang ii
levels. this mechanism would be expected to increase
stimulation of the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor, resulting in possible
beneficial effects on blood pressure and renal function
[17].

viously described [12–14,23]. each end of single 0.5 cm
long, hollow fibre dialysis tubing (0.1 mm inner diameter; molecular mass cut-off, 10 000 da; hospal,
meyzieu, france) was inserted into a manually dilated
end of two 30 cm long (inflow and outflow) hollow
polyethylene tubes (0.12 mm inner diameter, 0.65 mm
outer diameter; bioanalytical systems, indianapolis,
indiana, usa). the distance between the ends of the
polyethylene tubes was 3 mm (dialysis area), and the
dialysis fibre was sealed in place within the polyethylene tubes with cyanoacrylic glue. the dead volume of
the dialysis tubing and outflow tube was 3.6 ml. the
microdialysis probe was sterilized by a gas sterilization
method.
in vitro microdialysis

differences between arbs have not been well studied.
differences in the degree of  xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation
arising from unique drug–receptor subtype interactions
have not been quantified. the present study used
an animal model to demonstrate arb-specific effects
and to quantify these differences by comparing two
common agents, losartan and  xxxd3487xxx , at doses that
equally prevented the pressor response to ang ii
administration. we measured the effects on  xxxg101xxx  -receptor-mediated renal cgmp in conscious 4-week-old
sprague–dawley rats. the cgmp levels were measured by microdialysis in the outer renal cortex. renal
cgmp is produced in response to several stimuli
including bradykinin, which is in turn released on  xxxg101xxx  stimulation [11,13,16].
in vivo losartan is converted into an active metabolite,
exp 3174 [18]. the current study was designed to
allow time for this conversion. the differences in
affinity for the at1 -receptor for  xxxd3487xxx , losartan and
exp 3174 have not been tested in identical systems
[19,20]. however, in at1 -receptor-transfected cho
cells, the ki value for exp 3174 was about one-third of
that for  xxxd3487xxx , and that of losartan was 10 times
higher than that of  xxxd3487xxx  [21]. to address this
question, we monitored changes in local renal ang ii
levels in response to losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  administration. comparable peripheral effects of the respective
arbs [22] were confirmed by demonstrating an equal
effect on blood pressure with each drug.

methods
all experiments were performed in accordance with the
national institutes of health guidelines for the care
and use of laboratory animals, and were approved
by the university of virginia animal care and use
committee.
in vivo renal microdialysis technique

for the determination of renal interstitial fluid (rif)
cgmp, we constructed a microdialysis probe as pre-

best recoveries in vitro for cgmp were observed with a
perfusion rate of 3 ìl/min, and were 48% for ang ii
[24] and 70% for cgmp [12]. a negligible amount of
cgmp sticks to the polyethylene tubes of the dialysis
probes, as demonstrated by the in vitro recovery of
[3 h]cgmp at 99.8% [12] and [131 i]ang ii at 99.5%.
animal preparation

experiments were conducted in conscious 4-week-old
female sprague–dawley rats (n ¼ 8) purchased from
harlan sprague–dawley inc. (harlan teklad, madison,
wisconsin, usa). with the rats under general anaesthesia with 80 mg/kg ketamine intramuscularly (i.m.) (fort
dodge laboratories, fort dodge, indiana, usa) and
8 mg/kg xylazine i.m. (animal health division, bayer,
shawnee, kansas, usa), the right and left kidneys were
exposed via a midline abdominal incision. the renal
capsule of each kidney was penetrated with a 31-gauge
needle that was tunnelled in the outer renal cortex
1 mm from the outer renal surface for 0.5 cm before it
exited by penetrating the capsule again. the tip of the
needle was inserted into one end of the dialysis probe,
and the needle was pulled together with the dialysis
tube until the dialysis fibre was situated in the renal
cortex. the inflow and outflow tubes of dialysis probes
were tunnelled subcutaneously through a bevel-tipped
stainless steel tube, and were exteriorized near the
interscapular region.
to obtain vascular access, a heparinized polyethylene
tube (pe 50; becton dickinson, sparks, maryland,
usa) was inserted into the right carotid artery. this
tube was flushed daily with 10% heparin in 5%
dextrose in water (d5 w), and was capped with a small
piece of copper wire. exterior ends of these tubes were
secured in place by suturing them to skin at the exit
site. the exteriorized portions of the tubes were placed
in a stainless steel spring to prevent the rats from
damaging them. rats were allowed 7 days to recover
and to acclimatize to the laboratory. rats were housed
under controlled conditions (temperature, 21  18c;

 xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation by  xxxd3487xxx  siragy et al.

humidity, 60  10%; lighting, 8–20 h) and given a
normal sodium diet. experiments were started at the
same time (0800 h) each day to avoid any diurnal
variation of the measured substances. for collection of
rif, the inflow tube was connected to a gas-tight
syringe filled with ringer’s solution and perfused at
3 ml/min. the effluent was collected from the outflow
tube for 30 min sample periods in non-heparinized
plastic tubes, and was stored at ÿ808c until assayed for
cgmp.
systolic blood pressure responses to ang ii alone or
combined with losartan or  xxxd3487xxx 

to evaluate the equipotency of the antihypertensive
effects of utilized doses of losartan and  xxxd3487xxx ,
systolic blood pressure (sbp) was monitored during 8 h
intravenous (i.v.) administration of ang ii at 0.1 ìg/min
alone and in combination with oral administration of
losartan at 0.02 mmol/kg [24] or  xxxd3487xxx  0.02 mmol/kg
[20], in conscious, normotensive, sodium-depleted rats
(n ¼ 8). as reported previously, animals were prewarmed to 308c and the average pressure from three
cuff inflations was used to determine the sbp response
[25]. the inhibition of the ang ii-induced rise in blood
pressure in normotensive, salt-replete rats is commonly
used to assess the degree of blockade of the renin–
angiotensin system and can be used as an index to
compare effectiveness of various receptor blockers [26].
monitoring of ang ii and cgmp after arb treatment

rif cgmp levels were monitored before and 1.5 h
after intravenous bolus injection of equimolar doses of
losartan (0.02 mmol/kg) or  xxxd3487xxx  (0.02 mmol/kg) in
all eight rats while consuming a low sodium diet (0.04%
nacl). after 1 week, the same animals were given the
same doses of losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  administered orally.
rif cgmp levels were measured before and 5 and 8 h
after administration of arb. all animals were given
both  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan. this study was repeated
after combined oral administration of the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor
blocker, pd 123319 (pd) (50 ìg/kg) individually or
combined with losartan or  xxxd3487xxx . the time points
for measurement of rif cgmp were selected to allow
time for losartan to be converted into its active
metabolite, exp 3174 [27]. in both assays, the doses of
arb used were selected to have comparable peripheral
effects, as manifested in an equal effect on sbp from
losartan and  xxxd3487xxx  administration.

assay and inter-assay cross-reactivities with other cyclic
nucleotides were , 0.01%.
statistical analysis

comparisons among pharmacological agents and controls were examined by analysis of variance, including a
repeated-measure term, using the general linear models
procedure of the statistical analysis system. multiple
comparisons of individual pairs of effect means were
conducted by using the least-squares methods of
pooled variance. data are expressed as mean  se.
statistical significance was identified at p , 0.05.

results
effects on blood pressure from losartan and  xxxd3487xxx 
administration

in sodium-replete, conscious rats (n ¼ 8), ang ii infusion (0.1 ìg/min) caused a significant increase in sbp
(fig. 1). equimolar doses of both losartan and  xxxd3487xxx 
(0.02 mmol/kg) inhibited the pressor response to exogenously administered ang ii to a similar extent (fig.
1). a similar oral treatment in sodium-depleted rats
(n ¼ 8) produced identical hypotensive effects (fig. 2).
these results confirmed that the doses of arb used
had comparable peripheral effects in this model
whether ang ii was infused or endogenous renin
angiotensin system was stimulated by a low sodium
diet. in contrast, there were no changes in blood
pressure during combined administration of arb and
pd (data not shown).
changes in rif cgmp levels in response to intravenous
arb or pd administration

intravenous  xxxd3487xxx  administration resulted in highly
significant increases in rif cgmp levels. after 1.5 h of
 xxxd3487xxx  treatment, cgmp levels had increased from
(2.34  0.66) 3 10ÿ3 to (3.79  0.59) 3 10ÿ3 nmol/ml
(fig. 3a); a 69.1% increase (p , 0.0001) (fig. 3b).
intravenous administration of losartan also induced
higher rif cgmp levels, but the increase was markedly less prominent than with  xxxd3487xxx  (p , 0.0001
between the two treatments). after 1.5 h of losartan
treatment, cgmp levels were (3.28  0.91) 3 10ÿ3
nmol/ml (fig. 3a), a 10.3% increase from the baseline
values of (2.97  1.10) 3 10ÿ3 nmol/ml (p , 0.05) (fig.
3b). intravenous administration of pd alone did not
change rif cgmp. combined administration of pd
and losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  prevented the increase in rif
cgmp levels that are seen during the at1 -receptor
blockade alone (fig. 3a,b).

analytical methods

sbp was measured at 30 min intervals in the tail, and
recorded values were averaged for each study period.
rif cgmp levels in dialysate samples were measured
using an enzyme immunoassay [15,24]. the assays have
sensitivity at 0.5 fmol/ml for ang ii, and 0.1 nmol/l for
cgmp and 100% specificity for both factors. the intra-

changes in rif ang ii and cgmp levels in response to oral
arb or pd administration

the rif ang ii level was 90  3.2 fmol/ml at baseline and increased to 234  7.0 fmol/ml (p , 0.05) at
5 h post-losartan treatment, and to 477  17.5 fmol/ml
(p , 0.001) 5 h post- xxxd3487xxx  treatment (fig. 4). at 8 h

rif ang ii was not statistically different from baseline
levels (102  4.1 fmol/ml) post-losartan, while the levels continued to be elevated at 399  7.7 fmol/ml
(p , 0.001) post- xxxd3487xxx  administration. oral administration of  xxxd3487xxx  led to similar increases in rif
cgmp levels as those seen with intravenous administra-

tion. five hours after oral administration (0.02 mmol),
rif cgmp levels were increased by 48.3% from
baseline (p , 0.001). this increase was sustained 8 h
after administration (46.6% increase from baseline;
p , 0.001) (fig. 5a,b). a marked difference to the
 xxxd3487xxx  effect was seen in the response to oral
administration of losartan (0.02 mmol). orally administered losartan caused only a 10.9% increase from
baseline after 5 h (from 1.84  0.11 to 2.04  0.12 nmol/
l). this increase was not statistically significant. moreover, this small increase observed was not sustained
and, 8 h after oral losartan administration, rif cgmp
values had reverted to baseline (fig. 5a,b). oral administration of pd alone did not cause significant changes
in rif cgmp. combined administration of pd and
losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  prevented the increase in rif
cgmp that was seen with losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  alone
(fig. 5a,b).

 xxxd3487xxx . the differences are seen as elevated rif
cgmp levels, which have been shown to increase on
 xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation via a bradykinin–no-dependent mechanism [12–15]. in rats on a low sodium diet,
in the presence of an  xxxg101xxx  -receptor antagonist, endogenously produced ang ii binds to the at1 -receptor
and there is no increase in cgmp production. however,
blockade of at1 is known dramatically to increase ang
ii production with concomitant increases in cgmp
levels [28].

the results reported here indicate that at1 -receptor
blockade by  xxxd3487xxx  is more potent than that of
losartan, which could be reflected in greater renin
stimulation and elevated local concentrations of ang ii
available for binding to the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor. both losartan
and  xxxd3487xxx  have very low affinities for the  xxxg101xxx  [18,29], and the differences in response to are
not likely to be attributable to any blockade of this
receptor. we did not determine circulating levels of
losartan and  xxxd3487xxx , respectively, but the extension
of inhibition of ang ii effects both in sodium-depleted
rats and in sodium-replete rats was similar by both
agents, which strongly indicates equipotent arb doses.
differences between arbs have been noted earlier,
notably in binding specificities, dissociation rates and in
affinities to receptors not related to the at1 -receptor
[29–31].  xxxd3487xxx  has about five-fold to 10-fold higher
in vitro affinity for the at1 -receptor subtype than
losartan [21,30,32], and about one-third the at1 affinity
of the losartan metabolite exp 3174 [21]. however,
few direct comparisons between agents have been
undertaken and differences in selectivity for the  xxxg100xxx  in vivo have not been assayed previously. the
present study employs rif ang ii as a marker of  xxxg100xxx  blockade and rif cgmp levels as a marker of
 xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation. rif cgmp increase is mediated via bradykinin and no release, and is abolished
by the administration of bradykinin b2 -receptor antagonist,  xxxd2317xxx  [15], or the no synthase inhibitor lname [14]. there is no additive effect on the inhibition of rif cgmp increase from co-administration of

pd123319 and l-name, indicating that the increase is
mediated solely by the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor.
effects on rif cgmp levels from losartan or  xxxd3487xxx 
administration have been observed previously and have
been shown to be associated with bradykinin-mediated
no release [12,14,15]. two major differences between
the arbs  xxxd3487xxx  and losartan were demonstrated in
the present study.  xxxd3487xxx  showed greater pharmacological efficacy in blocking the at1 -receptor, as indicated by a greater increase in rif ang ii levels and
greater stimulation of the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor than losartan.
 xxxd3487xxx  also displayed markedly longer duration of
 xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation. differences were observed
regardless of route of arb administration. intravenous
administration led to five-fold greater increases in rif
cgmp from baseline with  xxxd3487xxx  than with losartan.
oral administration of losartan had little effect on
cgmp levels, and 8 h after administration the levels
had reverted to baseline. all effects on rif cgmp
levels were independent of the effects on blood
pressure, which were similar for both arbs, with both
modes of administration. blocking the effects of losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  with pd confirms that their effects on
renal cgmp are mediated via stimulation of the  xxxg101xxx . interestingly, pd alone produced no effect on
cgmp release. this indicates that at1 stimulation by
the endogenously produced basal ang ii following
sodium depletion in the presence of  xxxg101xxx  blockade is
not responsible for the cgmp production.
 xxxg101xxx  -mediated release of cgmp only occurs subsequent
to blockade of the at1 -receptor and is presumably due
to a rise in the local concentration of ang ii following

blockade of the at1 -receptor. in this study, we did not
monitor changes in renal function during changes in
rif cgmp in response to losartan or  xxxd3487xxx  treatment. previously, we demonstrated blood pressure
hypersensitivity to ang ii and reduction in renal
sodium excretion in the  xxxg101xxx  -receptor null mouse [33]
that possesses low renal cgmp, or after reduction in
rif cgmp in the normal rat [34]. rif cgmp inhibits
renal tubular sodium absorption via a protein kinase g
independent of haemodynamic changes [34].
the result of the i.v. administration can be explained
by the lower at1 -receptor affinity and the rapid
association and dissociation rates of losartan. the halflife at the at1 -receptor is markedly shorter for losartan
than for  xxxd3487xxx  (in the range 1–5 min for losartan
versus 30–60 min for  xxxd3487xxx ) [21,29]. the dissociation of losartan from the at1 -receptor would free up
the receptor to titrate ang ii molecules, reducing levels
of circulating renin and  xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation.
explaining the difference in duration of action between
 xxxd3487xxx  and losartan after oral administration is less
straightforward. losartan is a prodrug that in vivo is
metabolized to the active metabolite, exp 3174 [18].
dissociation rates for exp 3174 (around 30 min) are
similar to those for  xxxd3487xxx  [21,29,35], and the two
compounds have similar half-lives in vivo [24,30,36].
peak plasma levels of exp 3174 are reached 2–4 h
after oral administration of losartan [27]. in our assays,
we allowed time after oral administration for this
conversion to occur; thus, the differences in cgmp
between pharmacological agents cannot be attributed
to a delay in onset of action for exp 3174 after

 xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation by  xxxd3487xxx  siragy et al.

conversion. hence, other factors must be taken into
consideration. a greater selectivity of  xxxd3487xxx  for the
at1 -receptor may be a possible explanation [21]. as
at1 -receptor blockade does not affect ang ii synthesis
and breakdown, in contrast to angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibition, the effect of blocking the  xxxg100xxx  will be to increase local levels of ang ii,
following the interruption of the regulatory feed-back
mechanism of the juxtaglomerular cells, leading to
stimulation of  xxxg101xxx  -receptors [17].
for obvious reasons, the assay described in the present
review cannot be used in man. consequently, the
degree to which the results can be extrapolated to man
is uncertain. in man, increased potency and slow
dissociation rate of  xxxd3487xxx  have been demonstrated
in healthy volunteers, indicating that although  xxxd3487xxx 
plasma levels decreased by 90% over 24 h, ang ii
inhibition decreased by only 40% over the same time
period [37]. this is in line with the long duration of
 xxxg101xxx  -receptor stimulation observed in our model, but
controlled studies in humans would be required to
compare the possible clinical effects of arbs.
