hypermethylation of specific dna sequences has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of mds. until recently,
treatment options have been few, high risk, and mostly
ineffective. new discoveries, particularly in the area of
stimulating remaining normal myeloid cells to resume
growth and differentiation, hold promise for safer treatment regimens and improved outcomes. among the
promising new agents are nucleoside analogues, such as
5- xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx , which reactivate tumor
suppressor gene transcription through effects on dna

introduction
the myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) is a hematologic
disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to
peripheral blood cytopenias and progressive bone marrow
failure. generally 35% to 40% of cases transform to acute
myelogenous leukemia (aml), and most patients die from
infection or bleeding. [1-4] although there is no national registry for diagnosis, it is estimated that 15,000 to 20,000 new
mds cases are diagnosed each year, primarily in patients
over 60 years of age, for an incidence of 15 to 50 per 100,000
per year. whether due to better diagnosis, altered classification, an aging population, or a true increase in incidence, the
frequency of mds has risen since 1980 [3]. statistics are also
confounded by changes in classification coincident with
advances in the understanding of disease mechanisms that
provide new methods of differentiating among similar clinical
appearances [3].
despite these recent events, progress has been slow with
regard to treatment. five-year disease-free survival rates range
from <10% to 60% for specific risk groups, as defined by one

of the more recent mds classification systems. thus, supportive care remains the standard of treatment [5].
clinical features
mds initially presents clinically with the subtle and
nondiagnostic signs and symptoms of anemia—weakness,
fatigue, palpitations, dizziness, headaches, irritability, as
well as increases in hemorrhage (petechiae, ecchymosis,
frank bleeding) and infection [6]. mds is characterized
morphologically by peripheral cytopenias involving normal
or increased cellularity of bone marrow, although there are
exceptions in which the typical finding is hypocellular marrow or myelofibrosis [3, 4]. such exceptions are not rare,
again exemplifying the heterogeneous nature of conditions
identified as mds [7].
pathophysiology of mds
mds originates from a multilineage hematopoietic progenitor that (in most, but apparently not all cases) is committed to the myeloid, erythroid, and platelet series [2, 5, 8]. mds

considerable progress has been made recently in
defining and understanding the diverse members of the
group of hematologic disorders now known as the
myelodysplastic syndrome (mds). new systems of classification, based on the latest cytogenetic methodologies,
have generated better prognostic data, and basic
research has more closely associated molecular mechanisms with clinical subgroups. the mechanisms underlying most cases of myelodysplasia appear to be an array
of chromosomal abnormalities leading to suppression of
normal myeloid cell differentiation and dominance of
abnormal, immature cells. the process is progressive
and is mediated by a variety of cytokines, potential loss

classifications
the three major international diagnostic classifications
are compared in table 1.
the french, american, and british (fab) classification
until quite recently, classification of mds was based
on a system published in 1982 by a cooperative group of
hematologists from france, america, and britain [12, 13].
the fab group used conventional morphologic differences
to separate acute leukemias into three lymphoblastic (l1,
figure 1. pathophysiology of
mds. this schematic illustrates
components that contribute to the
development of mds and their
relationships. mutations in critical
growth-regulating genes in the
hematopoietic progenitor cells
block the cells’ normal differentiation and maturation. cytokine
imbalances and aberrant signal
transduction that result from these
mutations in the affected myeloid
cells lead to accelerated apoptosis. abbreviations:  xxxg1170xxx  = interleukin-1beta; tgf-beta = transforming

l2, l3), six myeloid (m1-m6, defined by degree of differentiation and cell maturation), and five dysmyelopoietic
groupings [14]. in this latter category, two groups refractory anemia (ra) and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (rars) had ≤5% blasts while refractory anemia
with excess blasts (raeb) and refractory anemia with
excess blasts in transformation (raeb-t) described
patients with blasts 6% to 29%. chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (cmml) was also included [14].
international prognostic scoring system (ipss)
extraordinary progress in cytogenetic analytical methodology identified additional prognostic criteria to supplement
the fab classification. in 1997 a new international group
was convened to generate a classification system corresponding to current advances in technology. this group, the
international mds risk analysis workshop, combined cytogenetic, clinical, and outcome data from 816 patients with
primary mds to produce the ipss [15]. cytogenetic subgroups, percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts, and number
of cytopenias proved to be the major prognostic variables.
multivariate analysis defined four groups with clearly distinctive median rates of survival and of evolution to aml. the
cytogenic subgroups that fell into the low-risk category
included -y alone, del(5q) (same as –5q) alone, and del(20q).
the high-risk category included any patient whose karyotype
showed abnormalities in chromosome 7 and patients with
complex abnormalities (≥3 anomalies). two intermediate
categories emerged during analysis of the data [16].
world health organization (who) classification
in 2000 another classification system was published by a
working group of the who, relying more closely on the fab
system of conventional morphologic criteria but also considering cytogenetic markers [17]. data from 1,600 patients with

can be of primary etiology or can be a consequence of
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or exposure to environmental toxins. part of the observed increase in its incidence appears
to be related to wider use of high-dose chemotherapy regimens
with stem cell infusion. this contributes to further stem cell
damage beyond that which has accumulated from exposure to
prior conventional-dose chemotherapy [9].
a number of chromosomal abnormalities involving critical genes that control hematopoiesis can give rise to mds
[10]. these genetic events affect myeloid cell maturation,
resulting in peripheral cytopenia accompanied by the accumulation of immature myeloblasts in the marrow [7]. another
consequence of the underlying genetic aberrations is alteration in cytokine regulation and response to cytokines, leading to increased apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells
and aberrant hematopoiesis [11]. the pathophysiology of
mds is represented in figure 1.
genetic abnormalities or altered gene expression patterns have been identified in at least 50% of primary mds
patients and 80% of secondary cases. most of these involve
partial or complete deletions of chromosomes 5 or 7. partial
deletions of chromosomes 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, and 20, as well
as additions and translocations, are also found. multiple
aberrations are associated with a poorer prognosis [5].

primary mds were evaluated, expanding the fab system by
two categories, for a total of seven, all having a high degree of
correlation with prognosis. cmml was eliminated from the
who categories. ra was split into pure refractory anemia
(pra) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia
(rcmd). some conditions previously classified as rars
were placed in the pure sideroblastic anemia group, while those
with additional dysplastic features were put into the rcmd
category, along with refractory anemias without ringed sideroblasts. raeb was divided into raeb i and raeb ii, based
on medullary and peripheral blast counts. raeb-t was
included under aml. additionally, –5q was separated out as a
distinct entity, although its relatively benign nature prevails
only if the proportion of medullary blasts is below 5% [18].
these new risk-rating systems introduce a certain
amount of confusion into studies comparing previous and
current therapy, and no system has yet to earn universal

current treatment options
the treatment goals for mds are to prevent or delay
progression to aml, to prolong survival, and to improve the
quality of life. until recently, supportive care has been the
mainstay of therapy. even now, the older age of most
patients with mds argues against employing the newer
treatment regimens such as dose-intensive chemotherapy
and bone marrow transplantation [8].
to address the problem of hematopoietic dysfunction in
myelodysplastic syndromes, various growth factors have
been used to stimulate blood cell production. the use of these
agents in the treatment of mds is not without controversy,
however, as they have the potential to stimulate proliferation,
block apoptosis, and promote survival of both normal
hematopoietic cells and preleukemic cells [19]. among the
newer treatments available, erythropoietin is the most commonly used. it is well tolerated, although few ever achieve a
transfusion-free state [10, 19]. patients with low serum erythropoietin levels and minimal red cell transfusion need are
most likely to achieve favorable responses after erythropoietin treatment, but other mds patients respond poorly,
exhibiting response rates of 10% or less.
clinical trials of gm-csf have shown that it increases
circulating neutrophil counts in a majority of mds patients.
these promising results have unfortunately not translated
into increased patient survival rates [19]. clinical trials of gcsf have also demonstrated significant effects on neutrophil counts in patients with mds, but not to the extent of
treatment with gm-csf [8]. although both gm-csf and
g-csf are effective in improving neutrophil counts in
mds, randomized studies have failed to show a clear benefit from these agents, as both therapies induce thrombocytopenia [8]. in the only randomized trial, treatment with
g-csf was associated with reduced survival compared with
supportive care [20]. g-csf can increase the ineffectiveness
of erythropoietin in reducing anemia associated with mds
subtypes ra, rars, and raeb when given in combination
with erythropoietin, and the demonstrated response rates
have approached 40% [21].
thrombopoietic growth factors are being evaluated in
single-agent and combination therapy regimens for mds, to
counteract thrombocytopenia, a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in mds [22]. several factors have been shown
to stimulate platelet production in humans in a dose-dependent manner, namely, recombinant forms of the ligand for
 xxxg1442xxx  receptor present on cells of the megakaryocyte lineage, full-length recombinant human  xxxg2282xxx  and a

stage for a more accurate evaluation of the promising new
treatment modalities currently being tested [19].

[31]. these results led one investigator to test atg in 25
patients with hypoplastic mds. patients with this uncommon
variant include those with ra, rars, or raeb, as classified according to the fab system. a single course of atg
produced a response in two-thirds of ra patients, one-third
of raeb patients, and no rars patients, reflecting the
disparate nature of the conditions classified as mds [32].
dna methyltransferase inhibition
dna methylation recently has been shown to play a key
role in myelodysplasia. dna methyltransferase enzymatically methylates cytosine residues in newly synthesized
dna, thus maintaining the parental pattern. methylation
usually suppresses gene transcription as effectively as it suppresses gene deletion [33]. two nucleosides that affect this
process have produced promising clinical results in inducing
remissions: 5- xxxd253xxx , a ring analogue of cytidine, and
 xxxd1823xxx  (5-aza-2′- xxxd1836xxx ).  xxxd253xxx  is incorporated into dna, where it produces a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of dna methyltransferase activity [29].
newly synthesized dna is consequently hypomethylated,
resulting in expression of previously quiescent genes (fig. 2).
two genes,  xxxg422xxx  and its homologous neighbor
 xxxg421xxx 
p16 , are homozygously deleted in acute lymphocytic
leukemia and many other cancer cell lines. these two genes
are upstream regulators of the rb/p16 tumor suppressor
pathway. when they are still present, they are frequently
inactivated by methylation [34]. one of these,  xxxg422xxx , a
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is progressively more
hypermethylated in progressively higher-risk mds [35].
 xxxg422xxx  is actively transcribed in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta [36].
on a slightly larger scale, chromatin structure, which is
dependent upon histone chemistry, is a crucial factor in regulating transcription. alterations in histones, specifically
hypoacetylation, and the consequent chromatin remodeling,

truncated, pegylated form of the same molecule, and recombinant human  xxxg2282xxx 
[23]. the potential utility of these agents in mds is under
investigation [23]. the biology and clinical development of
thrombopoietic growth factors is discussed in the article by
dr. george demetri in this supplement [24].
clinical studies have also explored pleiotropic growth factors as a means of hematopoietic support in mds. interleukin3 and interleukin-6 have been evaluated for their effects on
enhancing platelet and neutrophil counts in mds patients, but
they have proven to be ineffective because of limited activity
and therapy-related toxicities [10, 19].  xxxg1162xxx  is the
only pleiotropic growth factor currently available commercially for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. studies exploring the value of  xxxg1162xxx  as a thrombopoietic support
agent in mds are ongoing.
for younger patients, allogeneic stem cell transplantation
has produced cure rates between 30% and 50%, albeit with a
high treatment-associated mortality (20%). patients with
raeb and raeb-t have high rates of relapse [25]. multiple
improvements in transplant technology, including the use of
peripheral blood stem cells and minitransplants, are in investigational stages. transplants carry the additional advantage
of exerting a graft-versus-tumor (or graft-versus-leukemia)
effect [26].
chemotherapy is designed to eliminate abnormal cells in
mds. standard induction therapy with an anthracycline and
 xxxd1790xxx  produces response in approximately 50% to 60%
of patients, but the relapse rate is 90% within a median duration of less than one year [2, 8, 15, 27]. these regimens are
also accompanied by significant toxicities and risk of mortality with considerable decrease in quality of life.
in a strategy similar to the cytokine therapy, several agents
expected to stimulate a return to normal growth and differentiation are under evaluation. these include anti-tumor necrosis
factor-alpha agents such as etanercept, infliximab, and  xxxd2880xxx . other agents such as ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone,
 xxxd1682xxx  analogues,  xxxd1896xxx , lipopolysaccharide,
glucocorticoids, lectins, nucleoside analogues, hemins, and
 xxxd2154xxx , are being tested as differentiating
agents [28].  xxxd2071xxx  both inhibit proliferation of malignant cells and promote differentiation of normal cells [29].
finally, experience with aplastic anemia in children has
identified an immune component in certain cases of marrow
failure. treatment with antithymocyte globulin (atg) and
cyclosporin has restored normal hematopoiesis in 55% to
77% of patients [30]. immune suppression has also improved
the outcome of bone marrow transplantation in patients with
mds and a variety of leukemias—high-dose atg reduced
the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease in 55 adults
without adverse effects or compromise of donor chimerism

this implies that histone deacetylase inhibitors may be useful

clinical studies with  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx 
in preliminary studies,  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  inhibition of dna methyltransferase has shown promise in treating
mds. in a study of 29 elderly patients with high-risk mds,
 xxxd1823xxx  produced complete remission in 29% of patients
and partial remissions in 18% of patients, median duration of
remission is 7.75 months. median survival in these patients
was 28 months [37]. in a single-arm phase i/ii trial in which
patients with raeb and raeb-t received a continuous infusion of  xxxd253xxx , 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days repeated every
month, 49% of patients responded, with 37% having trilineage responses, either complete or partial. complete remission occurred in 5 of the 43 patients and partial remission in
11. median survival for all patients was 13.3 months, and
median duration of remission was 14.7 months (table 2) [1].
(patients who did not respond after 4 months were discontinued from the study.) a subsequent study using subcutaneous
bolus injection of  xxxd253xxx  produced a response in 50% of
patients, with 27% having trilineage responses (table 2) [38].

these promising results led to a phase iii trial involving 191 patients in three arms: standard supportive care
(n = 92), subcutaneous  xxxd253xxx  (n = 99). the trial
design is illustrated in figure 3. the calgb reported
significant differences in complete remissions, partial
remissions, and “improved” categories between the  xxxd253xxx -treated group and the group receiving only supportive care (table 4) [39]. there was a low treatment-related
mortality (<1%). the median duration of response was 15
months. highly significant differences were noted in the
patients’ times on study before exiting the trial due to lack
of response, transformation to leukemia, low platelet count
(<20,000), or death. a statistical analysis of competing
variables demonstrated a significant difference in time to
aml or death for those treated initially with  xxxd253xxx  or
supportive care of 22 months versus 12 months (p =
0.0034). transformation to aml was 2.8-fold (p = 0.003)
greater in the supportive-care group than in the  xxxd253xxx 
group suggesting that  xxxd253xxx  can prevent transformation to acute leukemia. overall survival in the crossover
arm was not significantly different when all crossover
patients were counted in the supportive care arm and compared with patients receiving induction  xxxd253xxx  (18
months versus 14 months). a quality-of-life analysis
showed that patients treated initially with  xxxd253xxx  had a
significantly greater improvement over time in fatigue,
dyspnea, physical functioning, and physiological distress
compared with those receiving supportive care only. these
results are summarized in tables 3 and 4 [40].
