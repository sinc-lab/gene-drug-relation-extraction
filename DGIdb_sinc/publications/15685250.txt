objective: sibutramine, a serotonin and  xxxg2148xxx  inhibitor, is widely used as an adjunctive obesity
treatment. there have been concerns that norepinephrine reuptake inhibition with sibutramine could exacerbate arterial
hypertension.
design: combined analysis of two placebo-controlled trials.
subjects: the combined data set consisted of 1336 patients. of these patients, 966 were randomized to sibutramine and 370
were randomized to placebo.
measurements: body weight, blood pressure, heart rate (hr).
results: sibutramine reduced body weight regardless of basal blood pressure. in the complete set of patients, systolic blood
pressure did not change with either intervention over the 48-week period (0.1715.5 mmhg with sibutramine,
0.2715.2 mmhg with placebo, p ¼ 0.9). the change in diastolic blood pressure over the 48 week period was 0.379.5 mmhg
with sibutramine and 0.879.2 mmhg with placebo (p ¼ 0.049). the blood pressure response was not exacerbated in patients
with grade 1 or 2 hypertension or in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. sibutramine treatment caused a slight increase
in supine hr that was sustained throughout the studies.
conclusions: sibutramine treatment is unlikely to elicit a critical increase in blood pressure even in hypertensive patients.
however, blood pressure and hr should be monitored closely. in patients who experience a clinically significant and sustained
increase in blood pressure, the drug should probably be discontinued.

introduction
one-third of the adult population in the united states is
obese and has an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.1–3
although life-style treatments should be considered first,
most patients do not achieve and maintain sufficient weight
loss with diet and exercise alone.4 one possible therapeutic
approach is a combination of diet and exercise with
antiobesity medications. the serotonin and norepinephrine
uptake inhibitor sibutramine is a widely used antiobesity
drug.5–7 sibutramine mediates increased satiety, although a

mild increase in energy expenditure may also contribute to
weight loss.8 norepinephrine uptake inhibition with sibutramine in peripheral tissues could exacerbate arterial
hypertension through an increase in synaptic norepinephrine concentrations. indeed, when applied locally to peripheral tissues,  xxxg2148xxx  blockade increases
norepinephrine overflow.9 however, sibutramine is administered systemically. in the central nervous system,  xxxg2148xxx  blockade attenuates sympathetic
outflow through activation of alpha-2 adrenoreceptors.10
therefore, the systemic application of any norepinephrine
uptake-inhibiting drug is associated with complex and
opposing cardiovascular effects.11–14 for example, in normal-weight and normotensive young subjects, sibutramine
acutely increases resting blood pressure. yet, the drug
profoundly attenuates the pressor response to sympathetic
stimuli through a ‘clonidine-like’ sympatholytic effect.12 the

complex interaction of peripheral and central nervous
mechanisms makes it difficult to predict the cardiovascular
response to sibutramine in patients with altered sympathetic
activity, such as obese hypertensives.15 a recent post marketing surveillance study suggested a significant decrease in
blood pressure with sibutramine in obese hypertensives.16
we pooled data from two recent clinical trials to determine
the effect of sibutramine treatment on blood pressure in
obese subjects with different degrees of hypertension. obese
patients with hypertension up to a blood pressure of 180/
110 mmhg were routinely included. we reasoned that this
analysis would provide a unique opportunity to assess the
role of the  xxxg2148xxx  function in long-term
blood pressure regulation.

study design
the present study is an analysis of data pooled from the two
recently conducted multicenter trials kd9618 (interval
study) and kd9706 (sat).17,18 both were multi-center,
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trials with
treatment periods of 48 and 54 weeks, respectively. in both
studies, all patients were submitted to a nonpharmacological
treatment program. in kd9618, after a 1-month sibutramine
run-in period, patients were randomized to continuous
treatment with sibutramine 15 mg, interval treatment with
sibutramine 15 mg, or placebo treatment. patients were
randomized to continuous treatment, interval treatment,
and placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. kd9706 compared the effect of
continuous therapy with sibutramine 15 mg and placebo. in
this study, patients were randomized 1:1 to sibutramine and
to placebo.
the combined data set consisted of 1349 patients
(kd9618: 405 patient continuous sibutramine treatment,
395 interval sibutramine treatment, 201 placebo; kd9706:
174 continuous sibutramine, 174 placebo). due to grade 3
hypertension, 13 patients were excluded from the statistical
analysis. the analysis set consisted of 1336 patients (table 1).
of these patients, 966 were randomized to sibutramine and
370 were randomized to placebo. in the full set of patients,
274 (20.5%) were treated with antihypertensive medications
(32.6% in grade 1 hypertension, 43% in grade 2 hypertension). in this group, 171 were treated with angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or  xxxg100xxx  blockers, 58
with diuretics, 16 with beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, 71 with
calcium channel blockers, and 43 with other antihypertensive agents. written informed consent was obtained before
study entry. both studies were approved by local ethics
committees.

anthropometric measurements
body weight was measured at each study visit with a
precision of 0.1 kg on validated scales. during the measurement, patients wore light clothes and no shoes. body height,
international journal of obesity

waist circumference (determined in an upright standing
position of a normal breathing patient and measured
horizontally between the lower border of the ribs and the
upper border of the hip bones), and hip circumference
(largest circumference above the trochanter major) were
measured with a margin of 71 cm. body mass index was
calculated.

blood pressure measurements
blood pressure was determined in the seated position with
both feet on the ground using an appropriately sized brachial
cuff and a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer. after a
resting period of 5 min, three measurements were taken and
averaged. heart rate (hr) was determined by palpation of the
radial artery.

stratification
in our analysis, we stratified patients according to blood
pressure before start of the study drug. blood pressure was
graded according to the current guidelines of the european
society of hypertension.19 normotension was defined as
blood pressure of o140/90 mmhg, grade 1 hypertension as
blood pressure 140–159/90–99 mmhg, grade 2 hypertension
as blood pressure 160–179/100–109 mmhg, and grade 3
hypertension as blood pressure of z180/110 mmhg. in all,
12 patients had grade 3 hypertension at the onset of the
study, which was a specified exclusion criterion in both
protocols. they were excluded from the statistical analysis.
the presence of systolic blood pressure (sbp) z140 mmhg
and a diastolic blood pressure (dbp) o90 mmhg was defined
as isolated systolic hypertension. patients with isolated
systolic hypertension were analyzed separately.

statistical methods
if not otherwise indicated, data are presented as mean7s.d.
quantitative differences between treatment groups were

compared with u-tests. qualitative differences were analyzed
with w2 testing. we used an intention to treat analysis. the
last observation was carried forward. the combined analysis
was designed according to a method by whitehead and
whitehead.20 the weight change in the placebo group of
kd9618 (intervall) had to be adjusted for the weight change
in the sibutramine run-in period. in this group, patients’
body weight was adjusted beginning at week 4. in each of
these patients, weight reduction in the sibutramine run-in
period was replaced by the maximal weight reduction at any
time point of the placebo treatment phase (week 4–48).

results
study design
the overall dropout rate was 21.9% (n ¼ 204) with sibutramine and 31.4% (n ¼ 116) with placebo (po0.0001). the
major reason for this difference was poor efficacy and
noncompliance in the placebo group. treatment was
discontinued due to side effects in 5.5% of the sibutramine-treated patients and in 6.2% of the placebo-treated
patients.

body weight response
body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference
before treatment were similar in the placebo and in the
sibutramine group (table 2). hypertensive patients were
heavier than normotensive patients (table 3). sibutramine
treatment elicited a greater decrease in body weight than
placebo treatment. in the complete set of patients, weight
reduction was 8.077.2 kg (n ¼ 966) with sibutramine and
3.678.0 with placebo (n ¼ 370) over the 48-week period
(po0.0001). most of the weight change occurred during the
first 12 weeks (figure 1). in normotensives, body weight
decreased to 8.176.9 kg with sibutramine and 3.578.2 kg
with placebo (po0.0001). in grade 1 hypertensives, body
weight decreased to 7.778.0 kg with sibutramine and
3.778.0 kg with placebo (po0.0001). in grade 2 hypertensives, the weight reduction was 7.178.6 kg sibutramine
and only 1.576.9 kg with placebo (p ¼ 0.0007). in patients
with isolated systolic hypertension, body weight decreased
to 8.576.8 kg with sibutramine and 4.877.6 kg with placebo
(po0.0001). with sibutramine, body mass decreased
to 2.972.6 kg/m2 and waist circumference decreased
to 7.977.3 cm. with placebo, body mass decreased to
1.372.8 kg/m2 and waist circumference decreased to
5.077.9 cm (po0.0001 for the comparisons with sibutramine).

and in the different blood pressure classes are given in

three groups according to the hr at study entry ( xxxd1097xxx , 72–79,

each group (mean hr increase 2.2–3.3 bpm compared with
placebo). interestingly, in the terzile of patients with a heart
beat of z80 bpm at week 0, both in the sibutramine and in
the placebo group a decrease of the hr to 2.6711.1 and
5.9710.7 bpm could be observed at the end of the study
(po0.0009).

decreased 3.0727 mg/dl with sibutramine and 5.4729 mg/dl
with placebo (p ¼ 0.15).

discussion
as expected, sibutramine caused a significantly greater
weight loss than placebo.5,6,21,22 the beneficial effect on
body weight was similar in normotensive patients and in
patients with different degrees of hypertension. the reduction in body weight with sibutramine was not associated
with a critical change in sbp compared with placebo
international journal of obesity

regardless of the blood pressure class. however, the response
to sibutramine was variable. numerically, we found a
0.1 mmhg difference in sbp between sibutramine and
placebo. dbp was 1.1 mmhg greater with sibutramine
treatment than with placebo. the blood pressure response
was not augmented in hypertensive patients. these results
support the findings from smaller previous studies conducted in obese subjects with controlled hypertension.23,24
sibutramine treatment caused a slight increase in supine hr
that was sustained throughout the study. these findings may
provide some guidance for the clinical use of sibutramine.
furthermore, the data give important new insights into
 xxxg2148xxx  physiology.
sibutramine’s effects on blood pressure regulation in the
chronic treatment of obese patients differ from its acute
application in normal-weight subjects. with short-term
sibutramine application in healthy subjects, resting blood
pressure increases, whereas blood pressure during sympathetic stimulation decreases.12–14 the latter effect may be
related to a ‘clonidine-like’ sympatholytic effect of  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition in the brain.10–12,14 in
contrast, in the present study, chronic sibutramine treatment
in obese patients increased blood pressure slightly or not at
all. body weight reduction with chronic treatment is an
obvious difference between acute and long-term sibutramine
application. body weight reduction is known to decrease the
blood pressure.25–27 the sibutramine-induced weight loss
may have offset the direct effect of sibutramine on resting
blood pressure. chronic reduction in renal sympathetic
activity with  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition11 may
also be contributory. finally, the sympatholytic ‘clonidinelike’ effects of sibutramine on the sympathetic nervous
system might be more prominent in obese patients than in
young normal weight subjects. in a large subgroup of obese
patients, sympathetic activity is increased even at rest.15,28
our analysis has several limitations. the analysis was
retrospective. furthermore, body weight change, rather
blood pressure response, was the primary end point of both
included studies. we cannot exclude completely that blood
pressure measurements were less accurate than in a hypertension trial. another limitation is that the design of the
included studies differed substantially.17,18 in kd9618
(intervall),17 a subgroup of the sibutramine-treated patients
were not treated continuously (interval treatment). the
interval group was on active treatment in weeks 1–12, in
weeks 19–30, and in weeks 37–48. thus, at the end of both
trials that were included in our analysis, patients were on
their assigned medications. we used established statistical
methods to account for these methodological differences.
despite all these limitations, we believe that our findings
may have important clinical implications. for example, our
present analysis suggests that initiation of sibutramine
treatment is unlikely to elicit a critical increase in blood
pressure even in hypertensive patients. however, the
response can be variable. therefore, blood pressure and hr
should be monitored carefully during sibutramine treatment.

sibutramine and blood pressure
j jordan et al

515
in patients who experience a clinically significant and sustained increase in blood pressure, the drug should probably be discontinued. in a recent analysis of long-term
sibutramine studies (412 months), 1.1% of the sibutraminetreated patients and 0.6% of the placebo-treated patients
withdrew from the studies due to hypertension.29 we do not
have sufficient data on patients with grade iii hypertension.
sibutramine treatment cannot be recommended in this
group before blood pressure control is achieved with
antihypertensive medications.
in obese hypertensive patients, sibutramine may have to
be combined with antihypertensive medications. in acute
studies, the increase in hr and blood pressure with
sibutramine was completely reversed with beta adrenoreceptor blockade.12 however, beta-adrenoreceptor blockade also
diminished resting energy expenditure, which may attenuate weight loss.12 nonetheless, in chronic studies, sibutramine reduced body weight in obese hypertensive patients
treated with a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker.30 in the present
study, patients who were treated with either angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or  xxxg100xxx  blockers had a
similar weight loss response to sibutramine as patients who
were untreated. in our analysis, we did not see a major
difference in the blood pressure response to sibutramine in
patients with or without antihypertensive medications.
further prospective studies are needed to address this issue
and to define the ‘ideal’ antihypertensive for the combination therapy with sibutramine. the weight loss with
sibutramine leads to an improvement in the lipid profile,
glycemic control, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular
risk factors irrespective of baseline blood pressure levels.
prospective studies have been initiated to answer the
question whether the improvement of these cardiovascular
risk factors by sibutramine-induced weight loss is associated
with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
