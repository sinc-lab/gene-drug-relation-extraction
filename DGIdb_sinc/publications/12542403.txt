abstract
since its introduction more than 30 years ago, tamoxifen has been the most widely used endocrine
therapy for the treatment of women with advanced breast cancer. more recently, a number of
alternative endocrine treatments have been developed, including several selective  xxxg730xxx 
modulators (serms), aromatase inhibitors (ais) and, most recently,  xxxd2165xxx  (‘ xxxd2165xxx ’).
 xxxd2165xxx  is an  xxxg730xxx  (er) antagonist, which, unlike the serms, has no known agonist
(estrogenic) effect and downregulates the er protein. tamoxifen is effective and well tolerated,
although the non-steroidal ais, anastrozole and letrozole, are more effective treatments for advanced
disease than tamoxifen.  xxxd2165xxx  has recently gained us food and drug administration approval
for the treatment of  xxxg1603xxx -positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women
with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy. in two global phase iii clinical trials
 xxxd2165xxx  was at least as effective and as equally well tolerated as anastrozole for the treatment of
postmenopausal women with advanced and metastatic breast cancer. in a retrospective analysis of
the combined data from these trials, mean duration of response was signiﬁcantly greater for
 xxxd2165xxx  compared with anastrozole. these new hormonal treatments expand the choice of
endocrine therapy for women with advanced breast cancer and offer new options for sequencing and
combining treatments.

introduction
although important for normal physiological growth processes, estrogens are also known to play a signiﬁcant role in
the stimulation and growth of breast tumors (hulka 1996).
estrogens regulate cell growth and differentiation by binding
to speciﬁc receptors that are present in 50–80% of breast
tumors (brueggemeier 2001, johnston 2001). inhibition of
estrogen production or reducing the binding of estrogen to
the  xxxg730xxx  (er) have long been recognized as
rational target mechanisms for the development of therapeutic agents and have been clinically exploited for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (fuqua et al. 1992).
in an attempt to block the effects of estrogen, a number
of different hormonal agents have been developed for the
treatment of breast cancer. over the past 60 years, androgens,
progesterones and pharmacological doses of estrogens have
been used to treat breast malignancies (goldenberg et al.
1973, pritchard & sutherland 1989, espie 1994). although

these therapies have shown efﬁcacy in some women, they
are all poorly tolerated, limiting their acceptance and usage,
especially for the treatment of advanced disease where maintaining quality of life is a major objective of treatment (gill
et al. 1993).
over the past 30 years, tamoxifen, an antiestrogen that
competitively inhibits estrogen–er binding, has been the
most widely used endocrine therapy for the treatment of
breast cancer (buzdar 2001). tamoxifen provides effective
palliation in patients with advanced disease and, when used
as adjuvant therapy, produces signiﬁcant increases in both
disease-free and overall survival (fisher et al. 2001). tamoxifen exhibits both estrogen agonist and antagonist effects,
depending on its target tissue. in the breast, tamoxifen acts
primarily as an estrogen-antagonist, whereas in bone, liver,
and the uterus, it acts predominantly as an estrogen-agonist.
the estrogen-agonist properties of tamoxifen can generate
positive effects in some tissues: in blood it may help reduce
serum cholesterol, and in bone tamoxifen helps to maintain

bone mineral density (chang et al. 1996, powles
et al. 1996). in other tissues, however, the estrogen-agonist
effects of tamoxifen may lead to a number of unwanted side
effects such as an increased risk of endometrial cancer
(fisher et al. 1994). tamoxifen is clearly of signiﬁcant clinical value and provides an important therapeutic option. however, many patients, particularly those with advanced disease,
will experience disease progression and require further treatment options (wolf et al. 1993).
in the search for improved efﬁcacy over tamoxifen, and
for the provision of additional effective hormonal therapy
after progression on tamoxifen, a number of new antiestrogenic therapies have been developed. these include several
additional non-steroidal agents, collectively termed the selective er modulators (serms), that work in a similar way to
tamoxifen (dhingra 2001), non-steroidal and steroidal aromatase inhibitors (ais) that inhibit the synthesis of estrogen in
postmenopausal women (miller & dixon 2000), and most
recently,  xxxd2165xxx  (‘ xxxd2165xxx ’) a new er antagonist that
downregulates cellular levels of the er (howell et al. 2000).
these new endocrine therapies may offer the opportunity for
longer disease control in patients with advanced disease who
have progressed on tamoxifen.

light of the improved response rates produced by anastrozole
and letrozole compared with tamoxifen, ais are now becoming the agents of choice for ﬁrst-line treatment of advanced
breast cancer in postmenopausal women, relegating tamoxifen to a second- or possibly even third-line treatment option.
recently, the arimidex, tamoxifen, alone or in combination (atac) trial has compared anastrozole with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.
currently available data from over 9300 patients suggests
superiority of anastrozole over tamoxifen in terms of
improved disease-free survival. anastrozole alone was signiﬁcantly more effective than the combination of anastrozole
and tamoxifen (the atac trialists’ group 2002).

 xxxd2165xxx : preclinical data
 xxxg730xxx  downregulation

 xxxd3402xxx  (hayes et al. 1995), raloxifene (thiebaud &
secrest 2001),  xxxd2322xxx  (dowsett et al. 2000), and  xxxd1941xxx  (rauschning & pritchard 1994) are all antiestrogens
that, like tamoxifen, compete with estrogen for the er and
have been collectively termed serms. however, none of
these agents has demonstrated any therapeutic advantage
over tamoxifen. moreover, due to their similar modes of
action, patients who have previously been treated with
tamoxifen are likely to have developed cross-resistance to
these agents (lee et al. 2000).

 xxxd2165xxx  is the ﬁrst of a new type of er antagonist that
has no known agonist effects and that downregulates cellular
levels of the er protein (wakeling 2000). like tamoxifen,
 xxxd2165xxx  competitively binds to the er but with a much
greater afﬁnity than tamoxifen – approximately 89% that of
estradiol, compared with 2.5% for tamoxifen (wakeling &
bowler 1987, wakeling et al. 1991). unlike tamoxifen,  xxxd2165xxx  causes complete abrogation of estrogen-sensitive
gene transcription and therefore does not exhibit the agonist
effects commonly associated with serms (wakeling 2000).
 xxxd2165xxx  also exerts a number of additional effects on the
er that give rise to a more effective inhibition of the action
of estrogen on breast tissue. these include inhibition of er
dimerization (fawell et al. 1990), and reduced shuttling of
the er from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (dauvois et al.
1993). the  xxxd2165xxx –er complex is also thought to be
highly labile, leading to its rapid degradation and hence a
marked loss of cellular er (fawell et al. 1990). a schematic
diagram highlighting the different approaches to antiestrogen
therapy, ais, serms and  xxxd2165xxx , is shown in fig. 1.

aromatase inhibitors

pharmacology of  xxxd2165xxx 

aromatase inhibitors inhibit the enzyme (aromatase) that
drives the conversion of adrenal-derived androgen to estrogen in postmenopausal women. both the third-generation,
non-steroidal ais, anastrozole (‘arimidex’) and letrozole,
have efﬁcacy advantages over tamoxifen in postmenopausal
patients as ﬁrst-line therapy (bonneterre et al. 2000, nabholtz et al. 2000, mouridsen et al. 2001). anastrozole also
demonstrates a safety advantage over tamoxifen (bonneterre
et al. 2000). these ais are more effective than  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate after progression on tamoxifen (buzdar et al. 1998,
dombernowsky et al. 1998). exemestane, a third-generation
steroidal ai, has also shown survival beneﬁts over  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate as second-line therapy (kaufmann et al. 2000). in the

studies in immature female rats demonstrated that, unlike
tamoxifen,  xxxd2165xxx  had no uterotropic (estrogen-agonist)
activity; when  xxxd2165xxx  was co-administered with estradiol
or tamoxifen, it effectively blocked the uterotropic activity
of both of these agents in a dose-dependent and complete
manner. in pigtailed monkeys, sustained antiestrogenic
effects were apparent following a single parenteral dose of
 xxxd2165xxx  (wakeling et al. 1991). further observations from
this study showed that the oral antiuterotropic activity of  xxxd2165xxx  was one order of magnitude less than its parenteral
potency (wakeling et al. 1991).
further characterization of  xxxd2165xxx  was conducted in
ovariectomized adult female monkeys in order to provide an

seen following estrogen withdrawal (dukes et al. 1992).

morris and wakeling:  xxxd2165xxx 
the antitumor activity of  xxxd2165xxx  was ﬁrst demonstrated in two models of human breast cancer grown in nude
mice; the growth of xenografts of mcf-7 cells, supported by
continuous treatment with estradiol, was completely blocked
for at least 4 weeks following a single injection of 5 mg
 xxxd2165xxx . similar reductions of tumor growth were seen in
the br10 human tumor model (wakeling et al. 1991).
additional studies in nude mice carrying xenografts of
mcf-7 cells showed that  xxxd2165xxx  suppressed the growth
of established tumors for twice as long as treatment with
tamoxifen. tumor growth was also delayed to a greater
extent in  xxxd2165xxx -treated mice than in tamoxifen-treated
mice. tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors, which grew in nude
mice after long-term tamoxifen treatment, remained sensitive
to growth inhibition by  xxxd2165xxx , indicating that  xxxd2165xxx 
is likely to be effective in patients with acquired resistance
to tamoxifen.  xxxd2165xxx  was also more effective than
tamoxifen in reducing the expression of er and progesterone
receptor (pgr) (osborne et al. 1994, 1995).

human pharmacokinetics and biological
effects
in one study, pharmacokinetic analyses of two dose regimens
of  xxxd2165xxx  (250 mg) indicated that there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the area under the concentration–time curve
(auc) between a single 5 ml dose and 2 × 2.5 ml doses;
plasma concentration at 28 days (cmin) and the maximum
plasma  xxxd2165xxx  conentration (cmax) were also similar
between the two groups. plasma concentration–time proﬁles
and overall exposure to  xxxd2165xxx  were similar for both dose
regimens. the ratio of geometric means of auc0–28 for the
single 5 ml and the 2 × 2.5 ml doses (1.01; 95% conﬁdence
interval (ci) 0.68 to 1.51) showed there was no difference
between the treatment regimens (p = 0.94) (robertson 2000).
when given monthly,  xxxd2165xxx  plasma concentration proﬁles were similar for the two dose regimens, reaching steady
state after 3–6 doses. comparison with single-dose data
showed approximately a twofold accumulation. in another
study, both regimens of  xxxd2165xxx  were equally effective in
maintaining plasma  xxxd2165xxx  levels for at least 30 months
(erikstein et al. 2001).
over the past decade, the biological effects of  xxxd2165xxx 
have been evaluated in trials in postmenopausal women with
primary breast cancer. in a phase i/ii trial, 56 postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer were randomized
to treatment with seven daily doses of 6 mg or 18 mg of a
short-acting formulation of  xxxd2165xxx  contained in a  xxxd3034xxx -based vehicle, or observation. serum concentrations of  xxxd2165xxx  were found to be dose dependent and a
threefold accumulation of the drug occurred over the 7-day
period. a signiﬁcant decrease in expression of er and pgr
provided evidence of both er downregulation and of the
absence of an estrogen-like effect. reduced tumor cell pro-

270

liferation, indicated by reduced ki67 expression and reduced
expression of the estrogen-regulated protein ps2, was also
observed (defriend et al. 1994).
in a subsequent study, previously untreated postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer were randomized
to the following: a single i.m. injection of sustained-release
 xxxd2165xxx  50, 125, or 250 mg, continuous oral daily tamoxifen, or matching placebo for 14–21 days before surgery with
curative intent. analyses of post-surgical specimens showed
statistically signiﬁcant reductions in er expression at all
doses of  xxxd2165xxx  compared with placebo, and for  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg compared with tamoxifen (fig. 2).  xxxd2165xxx 
produced signiﬁcant dose-dependent reductions in ki67 compared with placebo, although there were no signiﬁcant differences in ki67 labeling between  xxxd2165xxx  and tamoxifen.
for pgr expression,  xxxd2165xxx  produced signiﬁcant
reductions at the 125 mg and 250 mg doses compared with
placebo. in contrast, tamoxifen produced a signiﬁcant
increase in pgr expression relative to placebo, a ﬁnding that
can be attributed to its partial agonist effects and conﬁrming
that  xxxd2165xxx  has a different mode of action to tamoxifen
(robertson et al. 2001). in an analysis of the single-dose
pharmacokinetics from this trial, cmax, cmin, and auc
increased proportionally with all doses of  xxxd2165xxx . the
er index was reduced by 32, 55, and 72% for 50, 125, and
250 mg  xxxd2165xxx  respectively, indicating a dose–response
relationship with respect to er downregulation (robertson
et al. 2000). given the time to steady state, there may be a
delay in attainment of maximal er downregulation, and
further clinical trials are planned to investigate whether use
of a loading dose of  xxxd2165xxx  may shorten the time to
steady state, thereby improving the potential for response.

clinical efﬁcacy in postmenopausal
women with tamoxifen-resistant
advanced breast cancer
phase i/ii trials
initial efﬁcacy data for  xxxd2165xxx  in postmenopausal
patients with tamoxifen-resistant advanced breast cancer
showed a clinical beneﬁt (cb) (complete response + partial
response + stable disease for a duration of ⭓ 24 weeks) of
69% with a median duration of response (dor) of 26 months
(howell et al. 1996). as predicted from preclinical data,
these ﬁndings demonstrated that  xxxd2165xxx  was not crossresistant with tamoxifen in the clinical setting.

phase iii trials
two phase iii trials (0020 and 0021) were conducted to
establish the efﬁcacy of  xxxd2165xxx  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced disease after progression
on prior endocrine therapy (howell et al. 2002, osborne

et al. 2002). the trials were prospectively designed to allow
combination of results. anastrozole, the ﬁrst of the new generation of non-steroidal ais to gain us food and drug
administration (fda) approval for the second-line treatment
of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women progressing on tamoxifen, was chosen as the comparator in these
trials. both trials compared  xxxd2165xxx  (250 mg/i.m., once/
monthly) with anastrozole (1 mg/orally, once/daily).
trial 0020 was a randomized, open-label trial conducted
in europe, south africa and australia in which  xxxd2165xxx 
was given as a 1 × 5 ml i.m. injection. in this trial, the objective response (or) rate was similar for  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole (20.7% vs 15.7% respectively; p = 0.20). median
time to progression (ttp), the primary endpoint, was 5.5
months for  xxxd2165xxx  and 5.1 months for anastrozole
(hazard ratio (hr) 0.98; 95.14% ci 0.80 to 1.21; p = 0.84)
(fig. 3a) and after an extended median follow-up of 22.6
months, median dor was 15.0 months for  xxxd2165xxx  and
14.5 months for anastrozole (fig. 4a) (howell et al. 2002).
trial 0021 was a double-blind, double-dummy study
conducted in north america in which patients were given
 xxxd2165xxx  as 2 × 2.5 ml i.m. injections. the or rate was
similar in both treatment arms (17.5%; p = 0.96). however,
the cb rate was higher for  xxxd2165xxx  compared with anastrozole (although this was not statistically signiﬁcant) (42.2%
vs 36.1% respectively; 95% ci -4.00% to 16.41%, p = 0.26).
median ttp was 5.4 months for  xxxd2165xxx  and 3.4 months

www.endocrinology.org

for anastrozole (hr 0.92; 95.14% ci 0.74 to 1.14; p = 0.43)
(fig. 3b). in responding patients, after an extended median
follow-up of 21.3 months, median dor was 19.0 months for
 xxxd2165xxx  and 10.8 months for anastrozole (fig. 4b)
(osborne et al. 2002).
the functional assessment of cancer therapy – breast
(fact-b) questionnaire (cella et al. 1993) is a sensitive
measure for evaluating physical, functional, social and
emotional well-being of the patient. using the fact-b questionnaire, both phase iii trials demonstrated that quality of
life (qol) during treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  was similar to
that during treatment with anastrozole.  xxxd2165xxx  and
anastrozole were equally well tolerated with a similar number
of adverse events (aes) in both treatment groups (howell et
al. 2002, osborne et al. 2002).
 xxxd2165xxx  may offer certain beneﬁts compared with
daily oral dosing regimens. as the injection is given monthly,
patients do not have to remember to take tablets between
clinic visits, which may offer enhanced patient compliance
when compared with oral administration.

combined analyses of phase iii trials
after a median follow-up of 15.1 months, analyses of the
combined data from both trials showed median ttp of 5.5
months and 4.1 months (hr 0.95; 95% ci 0.82 to 1.10; p =
0.48) and or rates of 19.2% and 16.5% for  xxxd2165xxx  and

(mauriac et al. 2002).

 xxxd2165xxx : future perspectives
in april 2002,  xxxd2165xxx  gained fda approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive
advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed

on prior antiestrogen therapy. this new hormonal therapy
will provide a valuable option for the treatment of hormonesensitive disease.
in a recently reported phase iii trial comparing  xxxd2165xxx  with tamoxifen for ﬁrst-line treatment of advanced

2002). in a retrospective subgroup of patients with both erpositive and pgr-positive tumors, ttp was 11.4 months for
 xxxd2165xxx  and 8.5 months for tamoxifen (hr 0.85; 95% ci,
0.63 to 1.15). in this subgroup, or rates favored  xxxd2165xxx 
over tamoxifen (44.3% vs 29.8% respectively; p = 0.019).
these data demonstrate that  xxxd2165xxx  is effective and well
tolerated in the ﬁrst-line setting; further investigation may be
required to better characterize the most appropriate ﬁrst-line
population in which  xxxd2165xxx  should be used.
the development of agents that are more effective than
tamoxifen in the treatment of postmenopausal women with
advanced breast cancer, may mean that tamoxifen will be
used as a later treatment option. at the same time, the use of
ais as ﬁrst-line therapy looks set to change the sequence of
hormonal therapy for advanced disease, which necessitates
re-assessment of the choice of second- and third-line therapies. in a retrospective analysis of 57 women with advanced
breast cancer who had progressed after achieving a cb on
 xxxd2165xxx  subsequent to response and progression on tamoxifen, third-line hormonal therapy with anastrozole and letrozole produced cb in approximately 47% of patients (vergote
2002). interestingly, responses were seen in patients who had
derived cb from  xxxd2165xxx  treatment and also in those who
had not. this suggests that patients who progress on  xxxd2165xxx  retain sensitivity to subsequent hormonal therapy.
investigations into the efﬁcacy of  xxxd2165xxx  after ais are
now essential and studies are underway to assess this; preliminary data have shown responses to  xxxd2165xxx  in postmenopausal patients who had previously been treated with
ais after progression on tamoxifen (perey et al. 2002).
combinations of antiestrogen therapy with other antiproliferative agents may prove to be effective in enhancing efﬁcacy in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. recent
preclinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer cell
lines that have developed resistance to  xxxd2165xxx  show an
increased dependence on  xxxg682xxx 
(egfr)-mediated signaling (mcclelland et al. 2001). these
cells are highly sensitive to growth inhibition by the egfrtyrosine kinase inhibitor (egfr-tki) geﬁtinib (‘iressa’
 xxxd2186xxx ), an effective inhibitor of cell proliferation (chan et
al. 2001). the combination of  xxxd2165xxx  with other therapies
with different modes of action, such as geﬁtinib, may thus
provide future possibilities for enhancing response rates in
breast cancer therapy.
 xxxd2165xxx  is an effective treatment option for postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic breast
cancer who have progressed on prior endocrine therapy. as
 xxxd2165xxx  is not cross-resistant with other endocrine agents
it may prolong the time in which treatment with welltolerated hormonal therapy is possible, thus delaying the
need for cytotoxic chemotherapy.  xxxd2165xxx  will therefore

274

be a valuable additional therapy to currently available options
for women with advanced breast cancer.
