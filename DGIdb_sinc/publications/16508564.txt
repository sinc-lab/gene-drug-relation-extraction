introduction
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibition has long been recognized as a preferred
site for blockade of the  xxxg1950xxx –angiotensin–aldosterone
system (raas). indeed, skeggs and his coworkers [1],
who first identified and named the  xxxg36xxx  (ace), pointed out in 1957 that as  xxxg1950xxx  is
the initial and rate-limiting step in the cascade that
blocking this step would be the most likely to succeed.
since that time, a series of remarkable studies have
provided proof of the principle that inhibiting the raas
cascade has enormous therapeutic implications [2–9].
ace inhibition has proven its worth in a wide variety
of cardiovascular and renal disorders, followed more
recently by the angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs).
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibition, despite its promise, was held back by
a number of technical problems. the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors
that were developed had limited bioavailability and
thus limited efficacy [10–12]. moreover, the cost of
synthesis was high, limiting the dose and thus therapeutic
efficacy. the past few years have seen the development
of a  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd113xxx , which has unambiguous
clinical promise. our goal in this paper is to review
what has been learned in the laboratory and clinic, and
to paint with broad strokes the clinical implications of
these observations. at this stage of the evolution of
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibition, it is tempting to speculate, and we
have. what is speculative in this review is clearly
labeled so.

 xxxg1950xxx  inhibition: the evolution
 xxxg1950xxx  is positioned as the first and rate-limiting enzymatic step in the raas cascade. cleavage of the leu10 –
val11 peptide bond of  xxxg99xxx  is the initiating

step toward the generation of the potent vasoconstrictor
 xxxg99xxx  (ang ii).  xxxg1950xxx  has a remarkably high
specificity for only one known substrate,  xxxg99xxx . in contrast, ace, in addition to angiotensin, recognizes many peptide substrates, such as bradykinin.
alterations in its bradykinin metabolic clearance may
evoke undesirable side effects.
intensive efforts have been devoted to the identification
and development of potent  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors. initial
attempts to inhibit  xxxg1950xxx  utilized  xxxg1950xxx  antibodies or
synthetic analogs of the prosegment of the  xxxg1950xxx  precursor [13]. early synthetic compounds were peptide
analogs of the n-terminal sequence of  xxxg99xxx 
and focused on the leu10 –val11 cleavage site [14].
important chemical modifications included replacement
of the scissile bond with statine, an amino acid found in
pepstatin. statine served as a transition state mimic of the
structural conformation of the scissile bond of  xxxg99xxx  following its binding to  xxxg1950xxx  [15].  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors underwent further chemical refinement as peptide
bonds were stabilized. one representative example is
cgp 29287 [16]. synthetic analogs progressively
improved by reducing overall molecular weight and
replacing labile bonds. these alterations led to the
identification of several potent inhibitors, including
 xxxd1990xxx  [17], cgp 38560 [18],  xxxd3095xxx  [19], zankiren
[20], ciprokiren [21] and terlakiren [22].
more recently, significant improvement in the design
of potent and selective inhibitors of  xxxg1950xxx  has been
achieved with the aid of molecular modeling and the
use of x-ray structure analysis (fig. 1).  xxxg1950xxx  contains

two b-sheet domains, with the active site residing in a
cleft between these two domains. each domain contributes one  xxxd233xxx  residue necessary for catalytic
activity. an important early example of a potent inhibitor
is cgp 38560 (ic50 ¼ 0.7 nmol/l) [18].
significant improvement in binding affinity resulted
from the discovery of compounds that were less lipophilic and that optimized the interaction at the
large hydrophobic surface of the s3–s1 pocket [23].
a key finding was the identification of a unique subpocket, denoted s3sp [24]. although cgp 38560 did
not utilize this cavity, newer chemical scaffolds that
were designed to occupy this pocket showed markedly
improved characteristics. this s3sp subsite is found
only in  xxxg1950xxx , thus providing a novel distinction amongst
the class of aspartyl proteases [23]. this seminal
observation led to the identification of  xxxd113xxx , an
inhibitor with greatly enhanced binding affinity for  xxxg1950xxx 
and selectivity over that of other aspartyl proteases
(fig. 1b).

 xxxd113xxx  is a transition-state mimetic with increased hydrophilicity (log p oct/water ¼ 2.45 at ph 7.4) compared
to previously described  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors [24].  xxxd113xxx 
is one of the most potent inhibitors of human  xxxg1950xxx 
disclosed to date (ic50 ¼ 0.6 nmol/l). while  xxxd113xxx  also
displays high affinity for primate  xxxg1950xxx , it is notably less
active against  xxxg1950xxx  from the dog, rat, rabbit, pig and cat
[24]. this species specificity imparts a significant challenge to the investigator attempting to demonstrate functional effects in vivo in animal test systems. nevertheless,
significant progress has been made through the use of
primate and genetically modified animal models.

benazepril, and the arb,  xxxd3487xxx , the angiotensin at1
receptor blocker, each given  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg orally.  xxxd113xxx 
reduced bp to a greater extent and with a longer duration
of action than benazepril or  xxxd3487xxx . repeat dosing of
 xxxd113xxx  for 8 days in the sodium-depleted, telemetered
marmoset resulted in dose-dependent and sustained bp
reductions [24].
plasma  xxxg1950xxx  concentration (prc) (table 1) was dosedependently (3 and 10 mg/kg) increased in marmosets
following administration of  xxxd113xxx , confirming substantial  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition [24].  xxxg1950xxx  rose within 2 h in the
marmoset and remained elevated for at least 24 h. plasma
 xxxg1950xxx  activity (pra), measured with the antibody trapping method, discussed below, was markedly suppressed
in marmosets for 24 h. peak drug levels of 1.42  1.29 and
5.48  2.22 (mol/l  xxxd113xxx  were achieved at 1.5 h after
oral doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, and declined
gradually over the course of 24 h [25].
the development of the double transgenic rat (dtgr),
harboring both the human  xxxg1950xxx  and the human  xxxg99xxx  genes, has provided an alternative to primate
models for the evaluation of  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors. these rats
develop a rapidly progressive hypertension with severe
organ damage at a young age, and do not live beyond the
seventh or eighth week of age [26].  xxxd113xxx  dosedependently lowered bp after oral administration in
dtgr with a tmax of 15 min.  xxxd113xxx  was equipotent
to enalaprilat and  xxxd3487xxx  after intravenous dosing, and
equi-effective to ace inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade following oral administration [27].  xxxd113xxx 
(0.3–10 mg/kg per day) administered subcutaneously
for 2 weeks to dtgr via osmotic minipump reduced
bp dose-dependently [28].  xxxd113xxx  infusions also
prolonged survival, reduced proteinuria and cardiac
hypertrophy, and significantly attenuated macrophage
infiltration into the heart and kidney [28].  xxxd113xxx  thus
may provide tissue protection through inhibition of ang
ii-mediated inflammatory events at the tissue level.

 xxxg1950xxx  receptor

several years ago, a specific  xxxg1950xxx  receptor was found on
mesangial cells in culture [33].  xxxg1950xxx  binds to this
receptor with high affinity (kd ¼ 400 pmol/l) and elicits
an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1)
antigen and an increase in [3h]thymidine incorporation,
without cell proliferation [33].  xxxg1950xxx  binding to mesangial cells is not attenuated by the addition of a  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitor, indicating that the  xxxg1950xxx  catalytic site is distinct
from the receptor binding site. subsequent studies disclosed that binding of  xxxg1950xxx  to this receptor resulted in a
fourfold increase in catalytic activity [34]. once bound,
 xxxg1950xxx  induced a series of intracellular events, including
the activation of the map kinases,  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx , and
these effects were not attributable to the generation of
ang ii. this receptor is expressed in the glomerular
mesangium and in the subendothelium of coronary and
renal arteries. it is tempting to speculate that this
enhanced catalytic activity may provoke further endorgan damage and that a  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor might afford
additional protection over that of other raas inhibitors.
even more interesting speculation involves the fact that
the same receptor also binds prorenin, and when prorenin
is bound, it has a  xxxg1950xxx -like action. as recently reviewed

inhibitors of the raas. for example, ace inhibition
combined with angiotensin receptor blockade over a wide
range of doses resulted in consistent synergistic antihypertensive effects in the spontaneously hypertensive rat
(shr) [29]. however, only additive effects were noted
with a similar combination in sodium-deplete, normotensive humans [30]. a reactive rise in the secretion of
 xxxg1950xxx  with a subsequent increase in ang ii levels in
plasma, perhaps derived through alternative enzymatic
pathways, has been cited as a possible explanation for the
shallow dose–response curve seen during chronic dosing
with an ace inhibitor [31]. recently, it has been shown
that a combination of  xxxd113xxx  with either an ace
inhibitor or an arb resulted in greater than additive
antihypertensive effects in shr [25], extending findings
with an earlier-generation  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor in the guineapig [32]. all of these studies assessed the effects of
combining single-site raas inhibitors at sub-maximal
doses. future studies should focus on the outcome of
adding a second single-site raas inhibitor on top of a
maximum dose of initial therapy. an important question
is whether or not additional benefits can be realized
beyond bp, such as greater end-organ protection.

[35], prorenin is a powerful predictor of microvascular
complications in diabetes mellitus, without a mechanistic
explanation. if the action of prorenin on the  xxxg1950xxx  receptor accounts for this relationship, the therapeutic potential of the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor is obvious [35].
biochemical differences between single-site
raas inhibitors

a host of possible mechanisms are cited to account for the
beneficial effects of raas inhibitors in cardiovascular
and renal therapy: included are the hemodynamic consequences of ang ii neutralization and the suppression of
the ang ii-dependent generation of growth-promoting
pro-inflammatory cytokines, free oxygen radicals and
fibrosis mediators in tissues. the various methods used
to inhibit the raas differ biochemically (table 2).
single-site raas inhibitors were designed mainly for
inhibition of both the circulating and tissue raas,
depending on primary target and distribution of the drug,
but alternative mechanisms may contribute. possibilities
include blockade of non-ace-dependent ang ii generation, bradykinin and ang(1–7) accumulation, and angiotensin type 2 ( xxxg101xxx )-receptor stimulation leading to
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) release.  xxxg100xxx  antagonists block the
effects of ang ii generated by pathways other than ace,
such as the chymotrypsin-like angiotensin-generating
enzyme (cage) [36] or chymase [37] . in some organs,
such as the kidneys [38], heart [39] or blood vessels [40],
there is continued ang ii generation in patients treated

table 2

with ace inhibitors. moreover, non-ace pathways may
be activated in some pathological situations. ace inhibitors induce the accumulation of vasodilator and natriuretic peptides such as bradykinin and ang(1–7) [32], and of
the hematological peptide acsdkp [41–46]. ace
inhibitors decrease bradykinin degradation, thereby activating the  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx , leading to the release of no,
prostacyclin and other potent endothelial-derived local
vasodilator substances [41], which may in turn increase
their short-term hemodynamic effect. during chronic
ace inhibition, increases in ang(1–7) levels may potentiate the vasodilator activity of bradykinin by stimulating
no release [42].  xxxg100xxx  antagonists stimulate potentially
functioning  xxxg101xxx  receptors, which may in itself trigger a
vasodilator and natriuretic cascade involving bradykinin,
no and  xxxd1274xxx  and other ang ii receptors, the
functions of which remain unclear [40–45]. little is
known about the physiological consequences of activating these receptors, but, if such activation should prove to
be deleterious, then  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors would clearly enjoy
clinical advantages over alternative raas inhibitors.

methodological limitations in the study of
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors
several methodological issues must be taken into account
when comparing raas inhibitors, amplifying the complexity of the various biochemical effects of these drugs
(table 3). these methodological aspects probably
account for the considerable variability observed in the

results of comparative studies. these issues include
intrinsic characteristics of the drugs, the model used to
investigate them, the end points used, the experimental
design and the method used to compare raas
inhibition intensity.
the in vitro characterization of an raas inhibitor is
insufficient, as the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug
(absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination)
has a major influence on the intensity and duration of
the inhibition. comparison of a single dose of two inhibitors of the raas provides little information unless there
is evidence to suggest that the doses used are supramaximal. whatever the selected end point, dose–response
curves should be plotted over a wide range of doses, to
define the minimum and maximum effective doses for
each inhibitor.
the participation of the raas in bp control, and in other
vascular, cardiac and renal functions, varies between
models and between individuals. age, genetic factors,
ethnicity, and the involvement of multiple biological
pathogenic factors influence raas status. sodium intake
is the most well-known environmental factor affecting
the status of the raas and thus individual susceptibility
to raas inhibition in humans: low sodium intake
stimulates  xxxg1950xxx , whereas a positive sodium balance
inhibits  xxxg1950xxx . the efficacy of raas inhibition depends
on raas status.
the end points (bp, proteinuria, cardiac mass, vascular
smooth muscle cell proliferation, glomerulosclerosis) may
be influenced differentially. if the objective of a trial is to
compare the cardiovascular/renal/cerebrovascular effect
of different raas inhibitors, the decrease in bp achieved
by the two drugs should be the same, measured by a
method that is accurate, precise and sensitive. this
condition clearly excludes casual bp measurement by
indirect methods in animals or humans.
the difficulties encountered when comparing parallel
groups of patients or animals treated with different
blockers of the raas can be minimized by using an
approach in which a second blocker is administered in

addition to a maximal dose of the first blocker. the main
problem with this method is unambiguous definition of
the maximum effective dose. a factorial design covering a
large range of doses of both drugs would be ideal.
the decrease in bp induced by a single dose of ace
inhibitor or  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor may be different from that
following repeated administration, as reported for both
ace inhibitors and  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors [46].
the link between physiological plasma ang ii concentrations and bp is not easy to document. first, low
picomolar plasma ang ii, which has a half-life of some
16 s, is difficult to measure reliably in the presence of
high concentrations of precursor and metabolite peptides
[47,48]. second, bp depends to a variable degree on
ang ii levels; this is not surprising, as poiseuille’s formula
defines bp as the product of blood volume and vascular
resistance, and both these factors are determined by
factors beyond ang ii. however, changes in bp are well
correlated with changes in plasma ang ii induced by
specific inhibition of  xxxg1950xxx  in monkeys [49], sheep [50],
healthy human subjects [51] or hypertensive patients [52]
(fig. 2). obviously, the basic hypothesis that changes in
bp are related to changes in plasma ang ii levels is more
readily observed under conditions of stimulated  xxxg1950xxx 
release, such as on low-salt diet, diuretic treatment, or in
renovascular hypertension, when bp appears to depend
primarily on ang ii-induced vasoconstriction, but it has
recently also been shown that efficient ang ii antagonism
decreases bp in normal human volunteers even after
massive salt-loading [53].
hormonal time profiles during  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition show
parallel dose-related decreases in pra and angiotensin
i (ang i) and ang ii levels, and a slightly delayed increase
in prc (fig. 3). based on accurately measured hormone
profiles and knowledge of the inhibition constant ki of a
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor, enzyme kinetic considerations allow the
calculation of the necessary or minimal plasma inhibitor
concentration for any hypothetical plasma  xxxg1950xxx  concentration to achieve a desired plasma ang ii level (fig. 4).
the corresponding formula for the calculation of the
generation rate of ang i (and ang ii) during  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibition assumes michaelis–menten kinetics for competitive inhibition and steady-state conditions. the
michaelis–menten constant km and the rate constant
kcat for  xxxg1950xxx , and the inhibitor constant ki of a given  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitor of interest, are known constants. the concentrations of the enzyme  xxxg1950xxx  (e) and its substrate  xxxg99xxx  (s) can be measured and consequently ang i
generation rate can be calculated for any inhibitor concentration. plasma ang i and ang ii concentrations are
directly related to this ang i generation rate (fig. 5) and it
is therefore possible to link plasma drug levels to plasma
ang ii concentrations. if the plasma ang ii levels are
related to bp, as postulated in the basic hypothesis and

fall in plasma ang ii concentrations and the maximal fall in mabp in 12 hypertensive patients during and following a 30-min infusion of the  xxxg1950xxx

within the following hour. in (b) it is shown that ang ii concentrations may control blood pressure in these patients. (reproduced with permission from

documented in the previous paragraph, the formula can
provide precise goals for the development of  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors as efficient antihypertensive agents.
misunderstood terminology and a crucial artifact

human active  xxxg1950xxx  is an aspartyl protease of 340 amino
acids and 40 000 dalton molecular weight with two
n-glycosylation sites. it is secreted by the renal juxtaglomerular granular epithelioid cells. it is synthesized
in the cells as prorenin and activated by cleavage of an nterminal prosegment of 43 amino acids. prorenin is also
secreted into the blood. total plasma  xxxg1950xxx  therefore
consists of prorenin and activated  xxxg1950xxx . the plasma
prorenin/active  xxxg1950xxx  ratio is normally about 9/1 and
varies in disease states and during pharmacological interventions. the term ‘active  xxxg1950xxx ’ is often misunderstood
or confused with the term ‘ xxxg1950xxx  activity’ which describes
the work of the enzyme (in pmoles of generated ang i per
ml plasma during an incubation period of 1 h at physiological conditions). it is therefore recommended to
describe the mass or concentration of ‘active  xxxg1950xxx ’ as
‘ xxxg1950xxx  (concentration)’ to distinguish it from ‘prorenin
(concentration)’ and to avoid the term ‘total  xxxg1950xxx ’
(table 1). under physiological conditions, and in the
presence of relatively high  xxxg99xxx  concentrations, prc and pra are well correlated, but during
specific  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition, pra is decreased whereas prc
is increased, because the juxtaglomerular cells secrete
more  xxxg1950xxx  in response to decreased ang ii levels, thus
adding to the potential for confusion.
as stated above, pra precisely determines plasma ang ii
concentrations. therefore, while  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors were
supposed to decrease ang ii levels and thereby bp, the
difficult direct measurement of ang ii levels was not

applied to screen  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors for efficacy. instead the
more convenient pra was often measured during the
first two decades of  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor research. alas,  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitors which suppressed pra for hours after a single
intravenous or oral administration often did not induce a
sustained bp decrease. at the end of the 1980s, based on
ang ii measurements which precisely predicted bp
effects of  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors, we discovered that the widely
used and otherwise reliable conventional pra measurements provided artifacts when used for  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor
testing [54] (fig. 6). bp and plasma ang ii levels
remained low in monkeys infused with  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor,
but they returned rapidly to baseline values when infusions were discontinued [49]; in contrast, conventionally
measured pra remained suppressed for hours after the
infusion of the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor. this discrepancy between
 xxxg1950xxx  activity and bp was not observed, when in the same
monkey plasmas,  xxxg1950xxx  activity was measured by the
antibody trapping technique [55]. similarly, and at the
same time (1988/89), two virtually identical clinical studies with the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor cgp 38560a provided
identical dose-dependent profiles for plasma ang ii
levels, but pra profiles matched ang ii profiles only
when measured with the trapping technique, while conventionally measured  xxxg1950xxx  activities remained, independent of the administered dose, fully suppressed for hours
after discontinuation of the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor infusion [56].
thus, in most laboratories worldwide, screening for  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitors had selected molecules of activity that was of
several orders of magnitude less than assumed. reliable
comparison of ic50s of different  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors, based on
the trapping technique for  xxxg1950xxx  activity and on ang ii
measurement, allowed the selection of  xxxd113xxx  for
further development, since it was among the most potent
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors identified.

the measurement of ang ii levels remains the standard
to quantitate efficacy of  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors. pra measured
by the antibody trapping technique is the next best
method by which to judge  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition. indirectly,
prc reflects the blockade of the raas, since reduced
ang ii effects withdraw the feedback inhibition of renal
 xxxg1950xxx  secretion. immunometric assays based on highaffinity antibodies measure all  xxxg1950xxx  molecules in plasma,
as the affinity of antibodies to the enzymatic active site of
 xxxg1950xxx  is higher than the affinity of any  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor, and
thus removes  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors from the active site during
assays [57]. thus, inhibited and uninhibited  xxxg1950xxx  molecules are ‘counted’. it remains to be shown that  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitors do not activate prorenin in vitro.

 xxxd113xxx  is a potent competitive  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor (ic50:
0.6 nmol/l) that binds strongly to  xxxg1950xxx , but much more
weakly to other related aspartic peptidases (affinity lower
by a factor of more than 104), and is highly specific for
human and primate  xxxg1950xxx . this high potency against
human  xxxg1950xxx  compensates for the low absolute bioavailability of the drug.

the single and multiple-dose oral pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd113xxx  have been investigated over the dose range
40–1800 mg in healthy male subjects: plasma concentrations of  xxxd113xxx  peak between 2 and 4 h after administration and mean terminal half-life is 23–36 h after the
administration of multiple doses.  xxxd113xxx  pharmacokinetics deviate from dose linearity, as indicated by the
results obtained for single and multiple once-daily
administrations over 1 week [58]. in the dose range
of  xxxd113xxx  investigated in healthy male subjects
(40–1800 mg), cmax, cmax,ss, auc0–1 and auct increase
over-proportionally with doses above 80 mg. consistent
with a half-life of approximately 30 h, exposure to  xxxd113xxx  increases following multiple once-daily administration (24-h intervals), with steady state reached after
approximately 7 days, on the basis of pre-dose plasma
concentrations and the terminal half-life of  xxxd113xxx .

obtained in the fasting state.
after the administration of a single intravenous infusion
of 20 mg  xxxd113xxx  over 20 min in healthy male subjects,
plasma clearance was found to be approximately 9 l/h, the
hepatic extraction ratio was approximately 10%, and the
distribution volume at steady state was approximately

 xxxd113xxx  (40–1800 mg) given orally [58], with only a
minor contribution of the hepatic first pass effect.  xxxd113xxx  binds moderately strongly to plasma proteins. in
humans, mean protein-binding levels of 49.5% were
recorded, with binding concentration-independent over
the range 10–500 ng/ml. finally, in vitro inhibition data

ang ii radioreceptor binding assay have been used to
assess the intensity and duration of raas inhibition by
ace inhibitors or arbs in humans [60,61]. vascular
reactivity after exogenous ang i and ang ii injections
is not relevant for  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition. plasma ang ii concentration increases in response to  xxxg100xxx  blockade, but decreases with inhibition of ace or  xxxg1950xxx 
(table 2) and remains difficult to measure in the low
picomolar range. pra measures the enzymatic activity of
active  xxxg1950xxx  in plasma. it increases in the presence of an
ace inhibitor or an  xxxg100xxx  antagonist but decreases dosedependently in response to  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors (table 2).
the increase in plasma immunoreactive active  xxxg1950xxx 
concentration is the most straightforward marker for
monitoring time-dependent raas inhibition after intake
of a  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor. prc is determined by an immunoradiometric assay measuring the number of active  xxxg1950xxx 
molecules independently of their enzymatic activity [57].

variation in the increase in prc reflects the intensity and
duration of ang ii system neutralization. the use of  xxxg1950xxx 
release as a sensitive plasma biomarker of acute raas
inhibition has several advantages: (1) it can be used for all
classes of inhibitors, including dual raas inhibition and
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors, provided that  xxxg1950xxx  concentration is
measured by immunoradiometric assay; (2) the range
of variation for this factor is large, at about two orders
of magnitude; (3) this marker has been shown to parallel
strictly the intensity of raas inhibition, as assessed by
in vitro ang ii receptor binding assays, and is as effective
for assessment of the degree of  xxxg100xxx  blockade as
in vivo assessment by exogenous ang ii injection; and (4)
this measurement is more precise than the measurement
of bp, another marker used to quantify the intensity of
raas inhibition, especially in normotensive subjects.
finally, the most sensitive and reliable marker for assessing  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition in vivo is calculation of the pra to
active  xxxg1950xxx  ratio corresponding to the rate of ang i
production in vivo expressed in ng ang i/h per pg of
 xxxg1950xxx  released [20].
proof of concept studies in normotensive
healthy subjects

precise quantification of the intensity of raas inhibition
by different raas inhibitors and of different doses of the
same blocker remains difficult. the raas-dependence
of bp is a major determinant of the pharmacodynamic

response to raas inhibitors, and the contribution of the
raas to bp varies in hypertensive patients, and is
strongly dependent on age, sodium intake and genetic
factors [63]. one approach for the comparison of raas
inhibitors, providing valuable information for dose-range
selection, is the use of strictly controlled conditions and
highly selected individuals (such as  xxxg1950xxx -dependent
normotensive subjects or hypertensive patients) for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling [64].
plasma ang ii suppression by orally administered
 xxxd113xxx  solution and comparison of pharmacodynamic
effects of  xxxd113xxx  with those of the ace inhibitor
enalapril in normal subjects on a normal sodium diet

nussberger et al. [58] showed, using a double-blind,
three-way crossover protocol in normotensive healthy
subjects with a sodium intake of 100 mmol/day, that
 xxxd113xxx  treatment for 8 days (40–640 mg in solution)
inhibited pra in a dose-dependent manner, suppressed
the production of plasma ang i and ang ii, decreased
plasma and urinary aldosterone concentrations and
increased plasma immunoreactive active  xxxg1950xxx  concentration. plasma  xxxd113xxx  concentrations increased overproportionally to the administered dose. the results
obtained suggested that the hormonal effects of a
160 mg dose of  xxxd113xxx  in solution were equivalent to
those of a 20 mg tablet of enalapril. bp and heart rate
were not significantly affected by  xxxd113xxx  or enalapril in
these normotensive subjects on a constant 100 mmol/day
sodium diet.  xxxd113xxx  and enalapril were found to have a
small acute natriuretic effect on the first day of treatment,
with no significant decrease observed following repeated
dosing.  xxxd113xxx  was well tolerated.
comparison of the hormonal and bp effects of  xxxd113xxx 
and the arb,  xxxd3487xxx , in sodium-depleted
normotensive subjects

as part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four-period crossover single oral dose study, performed in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive subjects
to investigate the effects of a combination of  xxxd113xxx  and
the arb,  xxxd3487xxx , azizi et al. [65] compared the hormonal and hemodynamic effects of a high dose (300 mg) of
 xxxd113xxx  in its final formulation (film-coated tablet) with
the standard antihypertensive dose (160 mg) of  xxxd3487xxx .
mild sodium depletion, which increases prc by a factor
of two to three, was used to amplify the  xxxg1950xxx  response to
 xxxg100xxx  blockade and to provide optimal conditions
for unmasking the  xxxg1950xxx -dependence of bp in normotensive subjects [30]. in the fasted state,  xxxd113xxx  300 mg
was found to decrease pra, ang i and ang ii levels for
48 h, whereas  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg increased them.  xxxd113xxx 
300 mg increased prc more strongly, and for much
longer, than  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg.  xxxd113xxx  also decreased
urinary aldosterone excretion for longer and had a similar
bp-lowering effect to  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg.  xxxd113xxx  and
 xxxd3487xxx  were both well tolerated.

phase ii clinical studies in hypertensive patients

stanton et al. [69] compared the 4-week bp-lowering
effects and safety of  xxxd113xxx  (37.5, 75, 150 and
300 mg once daily as oral capsules) with those of the
arb losartan (100 mg) in a randomized, double-blind,
parallel group study in 226 patients with mild to moderate
essential hypertension. dose-dependent decreases in
daytime ambulatory systolic bp and in pra were
observed in patients treated with  xxxd113xxx . as no placebo
was used, it was not possible to determine the minimum
effective dose; however,  xxxd113xxx  75, 150 and 300 mg
daily and losartan 100 mg daily did not differ in terms of
changes in ambulatory daytime systolic bp.
in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebocontrolled, active comparator, 8-week, parallel group trial
in 652 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension,
gradman et al. [70] compared the office, sitting diastolic
bp (dbp)-lowering effects at trough of  xxxd113xxx  (150, 300
or 600 mg daily) and the arb irbesartan 150 mg daily.
 xxxd113xxx  significantly decreased trough dbp at 8 weeks,
in a dose-dependent manner, but the dose–response
curve was flat (fig. 7). doses of  xxxd113xxx  exceeding
300 mg daily had a significantly greater antihypertensive
effect than irbesartan 150 mg, whereas  xxxd113xxx , 150 mg
had a similar effect to irbesartan 150 mg. in this phase ii
trial in hypertensive patients, the safety profile of  xxxd113xxx  was similar to those of the placebo and irbesartan.
to conclude these preliminary clinical studies,  xxxd113xxx ,
administered once daily, lowered bp to a similar extent or
more strongly than standard doses of established arbs.

patients, although a clear dose–response relationship for

the longer duration of raas inhibition by  xxxd113xxx  than
by  xxxd3487xxx  suggests that ang ii was more efficiently
blocked by the  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor than by the arb in the
kidneys. this beneficial effect of  xxxd113xxx  may be due to
a combination of the long plasma half-life of this molecule and its high affinity for human  xxxg1950xxx , which is in the
low nanomolar range. these characteristics of  xxxd113xxx 
may have important clinical implications.  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitors induce a stronger renal vasodilator response than
ace inhibitors in sodium-restricted healthy subjects
[30]. in circumstances in which ang ii generation within
the kidney is activated by pathways dependent on or
independent of, ace, such as in patients with diabetic
nephropathy [66], or in african-american hypertensives
on a high-salt diet [67], we would expect to see specific
renal benefits of  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition in renal tissue [68]
following administration of an orally active  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor.

 xxxd113xxx  was demonstrated by ambulatory bp monitoring
[69]. indeed, it has been extremely difficult to construct
dose–response curves relating bp response to the dose
of ace inhibitors and arbs. the extent to which bp
can be decreased by a maximal blockade of the  xxxg1950xxx –
angiotensin system (ras) varies considerably from one
hypertensive patient to another. the possible range of
decrease is very narrow in patients with low- xxxg1950xxx  profiles
and much wider in high- xxxg1950xxx  patients. in addition to the
between-subject heterogeneity of bp dependence on the
raas, a physiological phenomenon minimizes the bp
effect. this phenomenon is the counter-regulatory
increase in  xxxg1950xxx  release triggered by drugs disrupting
the ang ii– xxxg1950xxx  negative feedback loop. at the end of
each dosing interval, when the amount of competitive
inhibitor or antagonist on the enzyme (ace) or receptor
( xxxg100xxx ) is declining, this counter-regulation could
offset pharmacological inhibition of the raas. as with
ace inhibitors and arbs, the administration of a  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitor increases circulating and intrarenal enzyme
( xxxg1950xxx ) levels. in order to provide sustained inhibition
of  xxxg1950xxx  activity, a  xxxg1950xxx  inhibitor should, therefore, be
potent and have a very high affinity to  xxxg1950xxx , its dissociation rate (koff) should be slow and its plasma and
tissue concentrations should remain high long enough to
inhibit each new  xxxg1950xxx  molecule released into the bloodstream or kidney.

 xxxg1950xxx  inhibition with  xxxd113xxx  azizi et al. 253

hormonal effects of a combination of  xxxd113xxx  and
 xxxd3487xxx  in mildly sodium-depleted
normotensive subjects

numerous experimental and clinical studies have
suggested that a combination of currently available
ace inhibitors and arbs has additive or synergistic
effects on bp and on the prevention of cardiovascular
and renal lesions [71–73]. this may be because arbs
inhibit the effects of non-ace-dependent ang ii
production, or because ace inhibition has an impact
on bradykinin–no-related effects. however, the synergistic/additive effects of low doses of two different raas
inhibitors may be better explained by inhibition of the
biological effects of the reactive  xxxg1950xxx  release triggered
by single-site raas inhibition. compensatory  xxxg1950xxx 
release is proportional to the decrease in the amount
of ang ii generated or bound to the at1 receptors of
the renal juxtaglomerular cells. this counter-regulation
may be overcome by using higher than usual or repeated doses of single-site raas inhibitors [60], or by
neutralizing the biological effects of the counterbalancing rise in prc by means of a combined raas inhibition.
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, fourperiod crossover single oral dose study described above,
azizi et al. [65] investigated whether a combination of
 xxxd113xxx  (150 mg) and the arb  xxxd3487xxx  (80 mg), which
inhibit the raas at the first and last step, respectively,
resulted in a stronger inhibition of the raas and larger
decreases in aldosterone excretion than higher doses of
each raas inhibitor given alone ( xxxd113xxx  300 mg or
 xxxd3487xxx  160 mg). in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive subjects, the raas inhibition induced by this dose
of an arb antagonist was enhanced by inhibiting  xxxg1950xxx 
activity via the co-administration of  xxxd113xxx . under
conditions in which the pharmacokinetic parameters of
neither drug were modified when the drugs were combined, a combination of  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  prevented
the increase in pra, and in plasma ang i and ang ii
concentrations observed with  xxxd3487xxx  alone [65]. notably,  xxxd113xxx  suppressed pra throughout the 24 h after
dosing even though prc remained significantly elevated
throughout this period. this indicates that the reactive
rise in  xxxg1950xxx  does not compromise the ability of  xxxd113xxx 
to suppress raas activity throughout the dosing interval,
consistent with the long half-life of  xxxd113xxx  (approximately 30 h).
the enhanced raas inhibition generated by the
combined treatment at doses of 80 mg  xxxd3487xxx  and
150 mg  xxxd113xxx  resulted in larger effects on prc
and urinary aldosterone concentrations than did that
induced by the standard 160 mg dose of  xxxd3487xxx  in
monotherapy. the effects of the combination on
 xxxg1950xxx  and aldosterone concentrations appeared to be
similar to those of the high (300 mg) dose of  xxxd113xxx 

in monotherapy. after taking into account the nonproportionality of plasma  xxxd113xxx  concentrations with
respect to the dose administered, a synergistic effect
on prc and on the decrease in urinary aldosterone
excretion was observed when these doses of a  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitor ( xxxd113xxx  150 mg) and an arb ( xxxd3487xxx 
80 mg) were combined. in mildly sodium-depleted
normotensive subjects, combination therapy lowered
bp to a similar extent to higher doses of  xxxd113xxx  or
 xxxd3487xxx . this may be due to the limited range of bp
variations that can be detected in mildly sodiumdepleted normotensive subjects. it would therefore be
worthwhile investigating the effects on bp of treatments
combining various doses of  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  in
hypertensive patients.
combinations of two different blockers of the ras?

table 2 shows the biochemical consequences for the
raas cascade of the various combinations of raas
inhibitors. as with the dual raas inhibition generated
by combining an arb and an ace inhibitor [71], the
combination of two pharmacological agents inhibiting
the first and last steps of the raas ( xxxg1950xxx  and the at1
receptor, respectively), minimizes, or even overcomes
the ‘escape’ observed with single-site raas inhibition
at selected doses in an acute setting. azizi et al. [65]
have shown that disruption of ang ii– xxxg1950xxx  feedback by
a low-dose combination of  xxxd113xxx  and  xxxd3487xxx  is
similar to that achieved with a high dose of  xxxd113xxx 
but more marked than that achieved with the standard
dose of  xxxd3487xxx  (160 mg). combined raas inhibition
therefore makes it possible to use lower doses of each
component to achieve a more effective and long-lasting
raas inhibition. the question of the influence of
dose selection and dosing interval remains critical for
all raas inhibitors and their effects on bp and target
organ protection. the additive or synergistic effects
of such combinations are more evident at low doses
than at high doses [74]. an advantage of synergy or
additivity between two antihypertensive drugs is
that the doses of individual drugs may be reduced
to achieve the same therapeutic response.
in terms of safety, one theoretical price to be paid
for combining two raas inhibitors is the potential
hazards of a complete raas inhibition, especially in
situations in which bp and renal function are renindependent: in elderly or salt-depleted patients, patients
receiving cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, patients with
renal artery stenosis and patients placed under anesthesia. the risks of hyperkalemia and anemia may
also be increased, especially in patients with renal
insufficiency. finally, combinations including an ace
inhibitor will be subject to the specific side effects of
ace inhibition (cough, angioneurotic edema). a more
complete and rigorous assessment of these risks
is needed.

what does the future hold?
therapeutics involving raas interruption over the past
two or three decades has involved addressing the question of whether or not inhibiting the system reduced
morbidity and/or mortality in patients. in a wide range of
clinical problems well beyond what might have been
imagined when pharmacological blockade first became
possible, the answer has been yes. raas inhibition
improves natural history, reducing both morbidity and
mortality. we have entered a new era in which the
question is no longer whether inhibition helps, but rather
how we can optimize inhibition. the use of ace inhibitor/arb combinations, as one example, has been mentioned several times in this review. one major problem
with these studies involves the issue of dose: clearly, one
cannot add an arbitrary dose of an ace inhibitor to an
arbitrary dose of an arb and provide a clear indication of
optimization. the dose range for ace inhibitors is limited by their adverse effects, but this does not apply to
arbs. they are remarkably well tolerated and can be
used in doses far above those employed for bp control.
there are currently three ongoing trials comparing the
effects of standard doses with much higher doses of
 xxxd3487xxx  (640 mg), candesartan (128 mg) and irbesartan
(900 mg). we already know that these doses are very well
tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
proteinuria. should the results indicate that higher doses
do provide better protection, the entire ace inhibitor/
arb interaction area will have to be reviewed. yet
another alternative involves blocking aldosterone. there
is preliminary but compelling data to indicate that the
addition of an aldosterone antagonist to an ace inhibitor
or an arb will improve left ventricular function or
proteinuria substantially more than the ace inhibitor
or arb alone [75]. we will have to learn to deal with the
problem of hyperkalemia in this setting. one can add
 xxxg1950xxx  inhibition as the fourth new possibility that requires
exploration. acting at the rate-limiting step,  xxxg1950xxx  inhibition provides a very attractive alternative. presumably,
we will have to explore the issue of combinations of  xxxg1950xxx 
inhibitor with either an angiotensin-receptor blocker or
an ace inhibitor, as indicated earlier in this review.
the next decade will be interesting indeed. the outcome is likely to be improved therapeutics for a large
number of patients.
