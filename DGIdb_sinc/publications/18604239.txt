background and purpose: heterologous expression of a1, b2 and g2s(g1) subunits produces a mixed population of gabaa
receptors containing a1b2 or a1b2g2s(g1) subunits. gaba sensitivity (lower in receptors containing g1 or g2s subunits) and
the potentiation of gaba-activated chloride currents (igaba) by benzodiazepines (bzds) are dependent on g2s(g1)
incorporation. a variable g subunit incorporation may affect the estimation of igaba potentiation by bzds. we propose an
approach for estimation of  xxxd1459xxx  efficiency that accounts for mixed population of a1b2 and a1b2g2s(g1) receptors.
experimental approach: we investigated the relation between gaba sensitivity (ec50) and  xxxd1459xxx  modulation by analysing
triazolam-,  xxxd1731xxx - and midazolam-induced potentiation of igaba in xenopus oocytes under two-microelectrode voltage
clamp.
key results: plotting ec50 versus  xxxd1459xxx -induced shifts of gaba concentration-response curves (dec50( xxxd1459xxx )) of oocytes injected
with different amounts of a1, b2 and g2s(g1) crna (1:1:1–1:1:10) revealed a linear regression between g2s(g1)-mediated
reduction of gaba sensitivity (ec50) and dec50( xxxd1459xxx ). the slope factors of the regression were always higher for oocytes
expressing a1b2g1 subunit receptors (1.8±0.1 (triazolam), 1.6±0.1 ( xxxd1731xxx ), 2.3±0.2 (midazolam)) than for oocytes
expressing a1b2g2s receptors (1.4±0.1 (triazolam), 1.4±0.1 ( xxxd1731xxx ), 1.3±0.1 (midazolam)). mutant gabaa receptors
(a1b2-r207cg2s) with lower gaba sensitivity showed higher drug efficiencies (slope factors ¼ 1.1±0.1 (triazolam), 1.1±0.1
( xxxd1731xxx ), 1.2±0.1 (midazolam)).
conclusions and implications: regression analysis enabled the estimation of  xxxd1459xxx  efficiency when variable mixtures of a1b2
and a1b2g2s(g1) receptors are expressed and provided new insights into the g2s(g1) dependency of  xxxd1459xxx  action.

introduction
gaba ( xxxd2177xxx ) mediates fast inhibitory transmission by interacting with gaba type a (gabaa) receptors
in the central nervous system. these ligand-gated ion
channels are assembled from individual subunits forming a
pentameric structure. a total of 19 isoforms of mammalian
gabaa receptor subunits have been cloned: a1–6, b1–3, g1–3,
d, e, p, r1–3 and y (barnard et al., 1998; simon et al., 2004).
the subunit composition determines gaba sensitivity, sensitivity for benzodiazepines (bzds), barbiturates, neurosteroids
and anaesthetics (sieghart, 1995; hevers and luddens, 1998;
sigel, 2002; ernst et al., 2003, 2005) and also the gating
properties of gabaa receptors (feng et al., 2004; boileau
et al., 2003, 2005). the n-terminal parts of a- and b-subunits

participate in the formation of the two agonist sites (sigel
et al., 1992; amin and weiss, 1993; boileau and czajkowski,
1999; wagner and czajkowski, 2001; newell and czajkowski,
2003). gaba binding to these sites leads to pore opening.
bzds interact with amino-acid residues located at the
interface between a- and g-subunits (macdonald and barker,
1978; sigel and buhr, 1997). these drugs allosterically
modulate activation of gabaa receptors either by increasing
apparent affinity of at least one agonist-binding site
(gallager and tallman, 1983; serfozo and cash, 1992; lavoie
and twyman, 1996) or affecting the pore opening (baur and
sigel, 2005). gabaa receptors carry two gaba-binding sites
at the respective ab interfaces (see twyman et al., 1990). by
selective disruption of the one or the other of these sites in
concatenated gabaa receptors, it recently has been demonstrated (baur and sigel, 2005) that chloride currents were
potentiated by diazepam in both cases.
heterologous expression systems are the basis for drug
development and pharmacological characterization of

different gabaa receptor subtypes. transfection of mammalian cells or crna injection into xenopus oocytes with a1, b2
and g2 subunits may, however, result in different mixtures of
a1b2 and a1b2g2 receptors (baumann et al., 2001; boileau
et al., 2002, 2003), which complicates the unequivocal
estimation of potencies and efficiencies of bzds in heterologous expression systems. this problem can be partially
overcome by injecting larger amounts of g2 subunit crna
(boileau et al., 2002) or, alternatively, by making use of
concatenated gabaa receptor subunits (baumann et al.,
2002; minier and sigel, 2004; boileau et al., 2005).
we have previously reported that different efficiencies of
bzds to enhance chloride currents through gabaa receptors
comprising g1 or g2s subunits are related to their ability to
shift the gaba concentration–response curves towards
higher gaba sensitivities (khom et al., 2006). here we
analyse the relation between g-induced inhibition of gaba
sensitivity and gaba-induced chloride current (igaba)
potentiation by three bzds (triazolam,  xxxd1731xxx  and
midazolam) in oocytes expressing different populations of
a1b2 and a1b2g2s(g1) subunit receptors. correlation analysis
yielded regression lines with slope factors reflecting higher
drug efficiency in g2s than in g1 subunit-comprising
receptors. gaba sensitivity and igaba potentiation of
concatenated subunits (g2-b2-a1 and b2-a1) fitted the
regression lines of non-concatenated receptors supporting
the hypothesis that their lower gaba sensitivity is due to
complete g2s incorporation (rather than forced subunit
arrangement). a simulation supports the hypothesis that
even under conditions where a higher ratio of g2s crna
relative to a1 and b2 crna is injected oocytes contain a
significant population of a1b2 receptors.
smaller slope factors of the regression lines were estimated
for oocytes expressing receptors with lower gaba sensitivity
(mutant b2-r207c; wagner et al., 2004).

materials and methods
expression of gabaa receptors
stage v–vi oocytes from xenopus laevis were prepared and
crna was injected as previously described by khom et al.
(2006). female x. laevis (nasco, wi, usa) were anaesthetized by exposing them for 15 min to a 0.2% ms-222
(methanesulphonate salt of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester;
sandoz, germany) solution before surgically removing parts
of the ovaries. follicle membranes from isolated oocytes
were enzymically digested with 2 mg ml1 collagenase (type
1a; sigma, vienna, germany). synthesis of capped run-off
poly(a þ ) crna transcripts was obtained from linearized
cdna templates (pcmv vector). at 1 day after enzymatic
isolation, the oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water
treated with diethylpyrocarbonate (sigma) containing the
different rat crnas at a concentration of approximately 300–
3000 pg nl1 per subunit. the amount of crna was determined by means of a nanodrop nd-1000 (kisker-biotech,
steinfurt, germany). to ensure expression of the g-subunit
with different incorporation in the case of a1b2g1 and
a1b2g2s receptors crnas were mixed in a ratios: 1:1:1, 1:1:3
and 1:1:10. the double b2-23-a1 (b2-a1) and triple g2-26-

425

b2-23-a1 (g2-b2-a1) concatemers (kindly provided by e sigel)
and the b2-r207c mutant (kindly provided by c czajkowski)
have been described previously (baumann et al., 2001,
2002; wagner et al., 2004). oocytes were stored at 18 1c in
nd96 solution (methfessel et al., 1986). voltage clamp
measurements were performed between days 1 and 5 after
crna injection.

two-microelectrode voltage clamp studies
electrophysiological experiments were performed by the
two-microelectrode voltage clamp method making use of a
turbo tec 01c amplifier (npi electronic gmbh, tamm,
germany) at a holding potential of 70 mv. the bath
solution contained 90 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2,
1 mm cacl2 and 5 mm hepes (ph 7.4).

perfusion system
gaba was applied by means of an automated fast perfusion
system according to baburin et al. (2006). to elicit igaba the
chamber was perfused with 120 ml of gaba-containing
solution at volume rates of 300 ml s1. duration of washout
periods was extended from 3 to up to 20 min with increasing
concentrations of applied gaba to account for slow recovery
from increasing levels of desensitization (see khom et al.,
2007 for details).

analysing concentration–response curves
concentration–response curves were generated and the data
were fitted by non-linear regression analysis using origin
software (originlab corporation, northampton, ma, usa).
data were fitted to the equation: 1=ð1 þ ðec50 =gabaþnh þ,
where ec50 is the concentration of the gaba that induces
half-maximal gaba-evoked current and nh is the hill
coefficient.
concentration–response data for each oocyte were
normalized to the maximum control gaba current for
that oocyte. statistical significance was calculated using
unpaired student’s t-test with a confidence interval of
po0.05.

calculation of ec50 and dec50 of mixed population
the ec50 values and  xxxd1459xxx -induced shifts in gaba sensitivity
in oocytes expressing mixed receptor populations (different
fractions of high gaba sensitive a1b2 versus low-sensitive
a1b2g2s receptors) are described by the concentration–
response curves for each receptor population by:
rab ¼

ð1þ

and
rabg ¼

iabg nabg
1 þ ðec50;abg =½gabaþhabg

where rab and rabg are peak igaba currents (number of open
channels in each population) at a given gaba concentration,

iab and iabg, amplitudes of single channel currents, nab and
nabg are numbers of channels characterized by ec50,ab and
ec50,abg, midpoints of concentration–response curves, hab
and habg—hill coefficients.
the total normalized igaba is a weighted sum of partial
current responses:

where f is the fraction (0ofo1) of current through
g-containing gabaa receptors at saturating gaba concentrations: f ¼ (iabgnabg)/(iabnab þ iabgnabg).
under-application of a saturating concentration of  xxxd1459xxx 
the receptor population consists of two subpopulations:
(1) ab receptors with unchanged ec50,ab and hab
and
(2) modulated abg receptors with enhanced gaba sensitivity (midpoint, ec50,mod and hill coefficient, hmod):

the apparent midpoints of the gaba concentration–
response curves (ec50) for oocytes expressing a given
fractions (f) of a1b2g2s receptors and the shift of this curve
(dec50( xxxd1459xxx )) at saturating concentrations of triazolam,
 xxxd1731xxx  and midazolam can be obtained by varying
the fractions (f) from 0 to 1 by maximum likelihood.

chemicals
compounds were obtained from the following sources:
triazolam
(8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-4h-1,2,
4-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine; sigma),  xxxd1731xxx 
(5-(2-chlorophenyl)-7-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2h-thieno
[2,3-e][1,4] xxxd1866xxx -2-one; troponwerke, köln, germany),
midazolam (8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4h-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine; hoffmann la roche, basel,
switzerland).

results
modulation by bzds of chloride currents through gabaa
receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes is dependent on the
incorporation of a g-subunit (boileau et al., 2002). on the
one hand injection of increasing amounts of g-encoding
crna (that is, a1:b2:g2s ratios of 1:1:3 or 1:1:10) gradually
reduces gaba sensitivity and, on the other hand, the
increased fraction of a1b2g2s receptors results in an
increased igaba potentiation by bzds. to quantify the
relation between g-subunit-mediated inhibition of gaba
sensitivity and  xxxd1459xxx  action we have analysed modulation of
gaba-induced chloride currents (igaba) in a large population
of oocytes injected with different mixtures (1:1:1, 1:1:3,
1:1:10) of wild-type or mutated a1, b2 and g2s or g1 gabaa
receptor subunits, or g2-b2-a1/b2-a1 concatenated constructs.
british journal of pharmacology (2008) 155 424–433

triazolam,  xxxd1731xxx  and midazolam were chosen because
these drugs modulate gabaa receptors incorporating g2s
and g1 subunits that would allow us to compare their action
at different efficiencies.

modulation of igaba by bzds in oocytes expressing variable ratios
of a1b2 versus a1b2g1 or a1b2g2s receptors
figure 1a illustrates the effect of triazolam on the concentration–response curves of igaba through gabaa receptors in
oocytes injected with different ratios of crnas encoding for
a1, b2 and g2s subunits. a saturating concentration (1 mm) of
triazolam shifted the gaba concentration–response curves
leftwards without significant effects on the maximal
response. higher g2s expression and thus, presumably
higher g2s incorporation resulted in reduced gaba sensitivity and larger triazolam-induced shifts of the gaba ec50
values (dec50(triazolam): 16 mm (crna ratio a1:b2:g2s 1:1:1),
24 mm (1:1:3), 50 mm (1:1:10; figure 1a, see also legend to
figure 1 for individual ec50 values).
the typical pattern of igaba modulation of an oocyte
(a1:b2:g2s crna ratio 1:1:3) is illustrated in figure 1b.
triazolam enhanced igaba predominantly at low gaba
concentrations corresponding to ec510 (concentrations of
gaba that induce 5–10% of maximal gaba-evoked current)
and had almost no effects at a saturating gaba concentration. similar observations were made for a1b2g1 receptors
(figure 1c).

different efficiencies of igaba potentiation in oocytes expressing
a1b2g1 or a1b2g2s receptors
figure 1 illustrates that gaba potency (ec50) and igaba
modulation by triazolam were both dependent on the
amount of g2s (or g1) incorporation (see also boileau et al.,
2002). these experiments confirmed that apparent higher
g-expression and correspondingly lower gaba sensitivity
were always associated with larger  xxxd1459xxx -induced shifts of the
curves. in line with boileau et al. (2002, 2003) we observed a
higher gaba sensitivity at crna ratios 1:1:1 and 1:1:3
compared to 1:1:10. the range of gaba ec50s for a given
crna ratio reflected differences in g-incorporations.
ec50s of individual oocytes were plotted versus the bzdinduced shifts of the gaba concentration–response curves
(dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s; figure 2). for all three compounds applied at
saturating concentrations, we obtained a clear correlation
between ec50s and dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s. the slope factors for
oocytes expressing a1b2g1 subunit receptors (1.8±0.1
(triazolam; figure 2a), 1.6±0.1 ( xxxd1731xxx ; figure 2b)
and 2.3±0.2 (midazolam; figure 2c)) were always higher
than for oocytes expressing a1b2g2s receptors (1.4±0.1
(triazolam; figure 2d), 1.4±0.1 ( xxxd1731xxx ; figure 2e)
and 1.3±0.1 (midazolam; figure 2f)). the regression line
approached the ordinate in the range of the ec50 of a1b2
receptors. the data suggest that the slope factors may reflect
the efficiency of igaba potentiation for these compounds
(see table 1). for  xxxd1731xxx , we estimated similar slopes
for g1- and g2s-incorporating receptors (difference statistically not significant; p40.05) whereas for triazolam and

represents one experiment on one oocyte.

midazolam the slopes of the regression lines for the two
receptor subtypes were significantly different (po0.05).

pharmacological properties of concatenated subunits fit the
extrapolated regression lines
if the inhibition of gaba sensitivity caused by g-incorporation correlates with igaba potentiation, then complete
g-incorporation in concatenated subunits is expected to
result in larger ec50s. to test this hypothesis we first injected
higher amounts of g1 and g2s subunit crna (1:1:20; see
figure 3). we obtained, however, only a non-significant
(po0.05) further reduction in gaba sensitivity (a1b2g1:
ec50 ¼ 61±3 mm, n ¼ 4 and a1b2g2s: ec50 ¼ 62±4 mm, n ¼ 4,
see dashed lines in figure 3). next we expressed a mixture of
concatenated subunit constructs (g2-b2-a1 and b2-a1, 1:1
ratio; baumann et al., 2002) and analysed the gaba
concentration–response curves. figure 3 compares the mean
gaba concentration–response curves obtained for oocytes

injected with crnas for a1b2 (1:1, n ¼ 6), a1b2g1 (1:1:10,
n ¼ 24), a1b2g1 (1:1:20, n ¼ 4), a1b2g2s (1:1:10, n ¼ 27),
a1b2g2s (1:1:20, n ¼ 4) or concatenated g2-b2-a1/b2-a1
receptors (1:1, n ¼ 18). in line with previous studies
(baumann et al., 2002) oocytes expressing concatenated
subunits in xenopus oocytes displayed a lower gaba
sensitivity. the ec50 of concatenated subunits was substantially shifted to the right (ec50 ¼ 186±13 mm, n ¼ 18; figures
3 and 4). the ec50s and corresponding shifts of the
concentration–response curve (dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s) for all three
compounds are shown in figures 4a–c. when ec50s and
corresponding dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s were added to the graph shown
in figure 2 (figures 4d–f) they fitted the extended linear
correlation obtained for non-concatenated subunits.

high (a1b2) and a low (a1b2g2s) gaba sensitivity. the total
normalized igaba is the weighted sum of partial current
responses of the individual receptors and only a1b2g2s are
sensitive to bzds (see materials and methods). the simulated
curves are shown in figure 4 (solid lines). to calculate the
putative fractions of a1b2 and a1b2g2s receptors for oocytes
displaying different gaba sensitivities we made use of the
concentration of half-maximal activation of the simulated
curve of ab receptors (ec50,a1b2 ¼ 8±2 mm, n ¼ 6; see also sigel
and baur, 2000; baumann et al., 2001) and ec50,a1b2g2s
(186 mm) of concatenated receptors and corresponding hill
coefficients (ha1b2 ¼ 1.0, ha1b2g2s ¼ 1.3) from our experiments
(see figure 3).
the maximum likelihood fit of the ec50 versus
dec50 relation predicts 100% g2s incorporation for the
concatenated receptors (figures 4d–f). our calculations
suggest, however, that even at a 1:1:10 crna ratio the
fraction (f) of current through a1b2g2s receptors accounts
for only between 50 and 70% of the total current. if we
assume that the single channel currents through g incorporating receptors is n times larger than through a1b2 receptors,

presence of 1 mm triazolam (a), 10 mm  xxxd1731xxx  (b) and 10 mm midazolam (c). the corresponding ec50 values were: 158 mm (control), 34 mm
(triazolam); 150 mm (control), 60 mm ( xxxd1731xxx ); 132 mm (control), 43 mm (midazolam). ec50 values of the gaba concentration–response
curves of oocytes expressing concatenated subunit constructs (g2-b2-a1 and b2-a1 in 1:1 ratio) and dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s induced by (d) 1 mm
triazolam, (e) 10 mm  xxxd1731xxx  and (f) 10 mm midazolam were added to the regression lines from figures 2d–f. corresponding regression
lines (dashed) were taken from figures 2d–f and extended towards the values of the concatenated subunits. solid lines (d–f) represent the nonlinear fit of equations 1–5 (see materials and methods) by the maximal likelihood. calculated current fractions of g-incorporating receptors (0,
50, 70 and 100%) are indicated. each graph (a, b and c) and each data point (d, e and f) represent one experiment on one oocyte.

then the fraction (f) of g incorporating receptors is given by
f ¼ f/(nf(1n)).
this formula accounts for differences in single channel
conductance. the frequency of openings and mean open
time also influences mean conductance of both subpopulations. the equation describing concentration–response curve
used in our calculation (see materials and methods)
estimates the fraction of open channels that in turn reflects
the mean open time of single channels at different gaba
concentrations and thus accounts for differences in open
time. assuming a twofold greater single channel conductance for a1b2g2s receptors (that is, n ¼ 2, see angelotti and
macdonald, 1993; fisher and macdonald, 1997) and fe70%
would predict fe54%. in other words, our analysis suggests
that even under conditions where a1:b2:g2s were injected at
a ratio of 1:1:10 only about 50% of the expressed receptors
contain a g2s subunit. this may explain the large difference
in ec50s of concatenated and non-concatenated receptors
(even at a ratio of 1:1:20; figure 3).

relation between ec50 and dec50( xxxd1459xxx ) on a gabaa receptor
mutant with reduced gaba sensitivity
larger slope factors of g1- versus lower slope factors of g2scontaining receptors indicated that this parameter provides a
measure of drug efficiency. to further validate the sensitivity
of this parameter, we made use of a mutation (b2-r207c;
located in the gaba-binding site), known to induce a
reduction in gaba sensitivity (see also wagner and

expressing a1b2-r207cg2s receptors and shifts of these ec50
values (dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s) caused by three bzds is shown in
figures 6d–f. the regression lines approach the ec50 axis in a
range (460–587 mm; figures 6d–f) close to the ec50 of a1b2r207c receptors (figure 5a). figures 6a–c illustrate typical
shifts of the dose–response curves by a saturating concentration of triazolam (1 mm) for different a1:b2-r207c:g2s crna
ratios (1:1:1—dec50 ¼ 421 mm, (a); 1:1:3—dec50 ¼ 948 mm, (b)
and 1:1:10—dec50 ¼ 2900 mm, (c); see also legend to figure 6
for individual ec50 values). the slopes of regression lines were
1.1±0.1 (triazolam), 1.1±0.1 ( xxxd1731xxx ) and 1.2±0.1
(midazolam). interestingly, the three bzds enhanced igaba
at saturating gaba concentrations (10–100 mm) where peak
currents in wild-type receptors were hardly affected (compare
triazolam action in figures 1 and 6).

discussion
this study revealed a linear correlation between the
g-subunit-mediated suppression and  xxxd1459xxx -induced increase of
gaba sensitivity in a1b2g2s and a1b2g1 receptors. we made
use of a statistical approach because direct evaluation of this
relationship is complicated by variable g-incorporation even
under conditions where high ratios of g-subunit crna relative
to a1 and b2 are injected. injection of higher crna ratio of
a1:b2:g2s than 1:1:10 induced only a slight further reduction
in gaba sensitivity suggesting a non-linear relationship
british journal of pharmacology (2008) 155 424–433

between crna ratios and g-subunit incorporation (see 1:1:20
ratio in figure 3 and also boileau et al., 2002). we have
therefore induced different g-expression by injecting different
crna ratios and analysed the relation between g-mediated
inhibition and  xxxd1459xxx -induced enhancement of gaba
sensitivity.

slopes of regression lines are inversely related to  xxxd1459xxx  efficiency
an initially observed trend that larger  xxxd1459xxx  induced shifts of
the concentration–response curves (dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s) in oocytes
expressing larger fractions of g-subunit-containing receptors
(induced by injection of increasing amounts of crna
encoding for g-subunits, figure 1) was confirmed by correlation analysis (figure 2). the linear relationship between
ec50 values and dec50( xxxd1459xxx ) suggests that bzds reduce a
g-subunit-mediated inhibition of gaba sensitivity. a slope of
1.0 would correspond to complete elimination of a
g-subunit-induced inhibition of gaba sensitivity and bzds
would correspondingly shift the concentration–response
curve of a1b2g1(2s) receptors to the position of a1b2
receptors. the observation that the tested bzds never
increased gaba sensitivity to that or above that of a1b2
receptors indicates that these drugs only partially can
compensate for the g-subunit-induced inhibition.
the estimated slope factors ranged from 1.1±0.1 in a1b2r207cg2s (triazolam,  xxxd1731xxx ) to 2.3±0.2 (midazolam)
in a1b2g1 subunit receptors. to evaluate the significance of
the slopes we compared the slopes on oocytes expressing

a1b2g1 and a1b2g2s subunit receptors. the present results
support previously estimated maximal igaba potentiation
by midazolam (342±64%)4clotiazepam (260±27%)e
triazolam (253±12%) for oocytes expressing a1b2g2s receptors (khom et al., 2006) and indicate a reversed order of
regression slopes (midazolam: 1.3±0.1oclotiazepam:
1.4±0.1 ¼ triazolam: 1.4±0.1). furthermore, steeper slopes
of the regression lines for a1b2g1 compared to a1b2g2s
receptors specify that midazolam and to a lesser extent
triazolam and  xxxd1731xxx  increase gaba sensitivity less
efficiently in a1b2g1 than in a1b2g2s receptors (figure 2),
which confirms our previous studies (khom et al., 2006).
taken together our data suggest that the slopes of
the regression lines between dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s and ec50s are
inversely related to drug efficiency.
the described approach is time consuming as it requires
the injection of different crna ratios and the measurements
of a large number of concentration–response curves. our
experiments under different conditions (including different
bzds, g-subunits and a mutation in the  xxxg221xxx ; figures 2,
4 and 6) revealed, however, that the regression lines
intercept the y-axis close to the ec50 of a1b2 receptors. this
finding prompted us to evaluate the possibility to use the
y-intercept and three randomly selected data points (crna
ratio 1:1:10; figures 2d–f) for correlation analysis. the
simplified procedure yielded regression lines with slopes
that were statistically not significantly different from larger
data sets (data not shown).
the relevance of the slope factor was further evaluated
making use of the mutation b2-r207c that is known to
induce a more than 60-fold reduction in gaba sensitivity
(wagner et al., 2004). figure 5a illustrates that co-expression
of g2s decreased the gaba sensitivity analogously to
wild-type receptors (figure 3). the estimated slope factors
(1.1±0.1 (triazolam), 1.1±0.1 ( xxxd1731xxx ) and 1.2±0.1
(midazolam); figure 6) were always smaller than in wild type
(though only in the case of triazolam and  xxxd1731xxx  that
difference was significant, po0.05), suggesting even higher
 xxxd1459xxx  efficiencies compared to wild type.

concatenated receptor subunits fit the regression lines
forced g2 subunit incorporation in oocytes was previously
shown to be associated with a significant loss in gaba
sensitivity compared to oocytes injected with 1:1:10 crna
ratios (baumann et al., 2002; see also figure 3; but see baur
et al., 2006). here we show that the higher ec50s and
corresponding dec50( xxxd1459xxx )s of concatenated subunits fit the
predictions of the regression lines of non-concatenated
subunits (figures 4d–f, closed triangles). the mean ec50
of the concatenated g2-b2-a1/b2-a1 subunits (figure 3)
corresponds to the data of baumann et al. (2002). lower
gaba sensitivity and higher  xxxd1459xxx  efficiencies of concatenated subunits expressed in xenopus oocytes may accordingly result from more complete g-incorporation (rather
than from forced subunit arrangement or interactions). our
data suggest that the studied gabaa receptor composed of
two concatenated constructs may represent a model
of completely assembled receptor with intact gabaand  xxxd1459xxx -binding sites. this hypothesis (based on the

431

extrapolation of the regression line; figure 4) requires,
however, further studies.
these experimental data could be reproduced by a
mathematical model describing  xxxd1459xxx  modulation in oocytes
expressing different current fractions of high gaba sensitive
a1b2 versus low-sensitive a1b2g2s receptors. maximum
likelihood analysis predicted (in line with the experimental
observations) a linear relationship that enables the calculation of a putative fraction of a1b2g2s receptors at a given
ec50 and dec50( xxxd1459xxx ). this calculation had, however, to
account for the different single channel conductance of the
two receptor subtypes (angelotti and macdonald, 1993;
fisher and macdonald, 1997). interestingly these independent calculations reproduced not only the linear correlation
but predicted the expected 100% g2s incorporation for the
concatemers and thus would support the experimental
findings of the concatenated receptors and our conclusions.

percentage of a1b2g2 receptors in oocytes expressing these
subunits
boileau et al. (2002) have clearly demonstrated that injecting
higher ratios of g2 subunit crna results in a purer
population of a1b2g2 subunit receptors. in addition, they
observed a remarkable run-down of  xxxd1459xxx  modulation,
suggesting a decay of g2 subunit-incorporating receptors
over time after injection into oocytes that makes it difficult
to compare data from different labs. furthermore, small
changes in the applied effective gaba concentration
(usually between ec3 and ec10) can substantially affect the
apparent  xxxd1459xxx  efficiency, thus further confounding a calculation of the percentage of expressed a1b2g2s receptors. the
method suggested above for determining the slope of the
regression line, however, also allows the determination of
the percentage of a1b2g2s receptors. after correction for
single channel conductances (assuming a twofold difference
in the single channel conductance of a1b2 and a1b2g2s
receptors, angelotti and macdonald, 1993; fisher and
macdonald, 1997), a 70% current ratio would correspond
to about 50% of g2s subunit incorporation.
the regression slopes are independent from variations in
expression of a1b2 versus a1b2g2s(g1) fractions or variations
in experimental conditions (gaba concentration). the
statistical analysis described here is based on the different
shifts of the concentration–response curves and, therefore,
independent of these possible experimental errors. the low
percentage of a1b2g2s receptors formed under the conditions used indicate that at least in the xenopus oocyte system
(but not necessarily in other heterologous expression
systems or under native conditions) the efficiency of
assembly of a1b2 receptors might be comparable to or even
higher than that of a1b2g2s receptors, resulting in comparable amounts of a1b2 or a1b2g2s receptors even when high
concentrations of g-subunits are available.

implications for the mechanism of  xxxd1459xxx  action
the different shifts in the gaba concentration–response
curves for gabaa receptors with different subunit compositions or mutants can be interpreted in terms of a mechanism

estimating benzodiazepine efficiency
i baburin et al

where bzds increase the microscopic affinity of the gababinding site or, alternatively, by a mechanism where bzds
facilitate channel gating (for example, jones-davis et al.,
2005). the second scenario is supported by previous findings
suggesting that  xxxd1459xxx -like modulators enhance the amplitude
of the gaba response by stabilizing the open channel
conformation (downing et al., 2005; rusch and forman,
2005; campo-soria et al., 2006).
we are tempted to speculate that the  xxxd1459xxx -induced igaba
increase reflects an increase in gaba efficacy (as defined by
colquhoun, 1998) by a direct transduction of the  xxxd1459xxx  effect
to the channel region (akabas, 2004; ernst et al., 2005). an
increase of efficacy from apparent low level (for example, in
mutant b2-r207c or concatemers) could explain an increase
of the maximal gaba response (‘over-potentiation’ of the
bzds on the a1b2-r207cg2s isoform or concatenated
receptors) and a simultaneous shift of the concentration–response curve (figures 4a–c and 6a–c; colquhoun,
1998; downing et al., 2005; rusch and forman, 2005;
campo-soria et al., 2006). these theoretical considerations
need, however, more experimental validation including
the investigation of further mutations (for example, in
the putative gaba-binding site and/or pore region) and
the use of bzds with a broad range of efficiencies.
