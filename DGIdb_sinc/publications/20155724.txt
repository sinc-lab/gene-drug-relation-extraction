mtor inhibitor/proliferation signal inhibitors: entering or leaving the field?  the mammalian  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) is a highly conserved  xxxg1377xxx  that controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors, cellular energy and stress, and has pleiotropic effects. its blockade, by mtor inhibitors (mtor-is), such as sirolimus or  xxxd2072xxx , leads to antiproliferative effects.
