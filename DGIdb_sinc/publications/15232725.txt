new treatment options
for chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting

abstract significant progress has
been made in the development of
effective, convenient, and well-tolerated means to prevent nausea and
vomiting associated with cancer
chemotherapy (cinv). nevertheless,
a substantial minority of patients
continues to have suboptimal antiemetic control, and additional treatment approaches are needed. one
avenue of investigation being pursued involves the evaluation of a new
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist ( xxxd2834xxx ) that differs from available serotonin antagonists in its markedly
longer half-life (40 h) and greater
binding affinity for the type-three
serotonin receptor. analysis of
available clinical data demonstrates
that  xxxd2834xxx  is an active and
well tolerated new 5-ht3 antagonist.
additional studies incorporating
dexamethasone and repetitive-day
conventional 5-ht3 antagonist dosing will be necessary to definitively
determine the relative efficacy of

introduction
of the many advances that have been made in recent years
in the supportive management of patients with cancer,
improvement in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv) has been among the most gratifying. the most significant progress was realized during
the decade of the 1990’s. during that time, selective antagonists of the type three 5-hydroxytrytamine (5-ht3)
receptor were first introduced and quickly became the
cornerstone of antiemetic management [11, 12]. in addi-

 xxxd2834xxx  compared to available
agents. another very promising area
that moves beyond serotonin focuses
on  xxxg2240xxx  as a therapeutic target.  xxxg2240xxx  is a tachykinin found
in neurons in the brainstem. it is the
preferred ligand for the neurokinin-1
( xxxg234xxx ) receptor. preclinical studies
with selective  xxxg234xxx  antagonists have
demonstrated promising antiemetic
activity. subsequent clinical trials
with selective  xxxg234xxx  antagonists for
the prevention of cinv have validated the preclinical promise demonstrated with these agents. one
agent in this new therapeutic class
( xxxd203xxx ) recently received regulatory approval in the united states for
use in combination with a 5-ht3 antagonist and dexamethasone, defining
a new standard of care for highlyemetogenic chemotherapy.

tion, several clinical trials confirmed the value of combining corticosteroids with the 5-ht3 antagonists [13].
also, in an attempt to improve overall care by standardizing treatment approaches, evidence-based guidelines
were developed and widely disseminated [6, 23]. as a
consequence of these developments, clinicians for the first
time achieved the ability to prevent emesis in the majority
of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.
yet sometimes lost in all the excitement about the
therapeutic progress has been the observation that a substantial minority of patients continue to experience emesis.

grunberg et al [8]

many caregivers have the perception that chemotherapyinduced emesis is no longer a significant problem. a recent study documented the apparent disconnect between
clinicians outcome expectations and patient’s actual experience. grunberg et al. studied a cohort of patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy for the first
time [8]. all patients received a 5-ht3 antagonist, and
84% also received a corticosteroid. the physicians and
nurses of this patient cohort were asked, prior to initiating
chemotherapy, to estimate the control rates for acute and
delayed nausea and vomiting likely to be achieved. the
patient’s actual antiemetic outcomes were then assessed.
clinicians consistently overestimated control rates (table 1). the discrepancy was most evident for delayed
nausea and vomiting where the observed control was approximately 30% lower than the clinician estimates. this
study serves to illustrate the persistent need to further
improve the control of acute (<24 h postchemotherapy)
and especially delayed (>24 h postchemotherapy) emesis.
additional challenges include maintenance of efficacy
during multiple cycles of chemotherapy and improving
emesis control in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy.
effective new treatment approaches are needed.

new directions
second-generation  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
one avenue of investigation currently being pursued involves the evaluation of a new  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
( xxxd2834xxx ). the available first-generation 5-ht3 antagonists ( xxxd1924xxx , granisetron, ondansetron, and  xxxd3451xxx ) form the cornerstone of antiemetic therapy for
moderate-highly emetogenic chemotherapy. randomized
trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety for these agents [12]. available evidence suggests the
greatest efficacy of these agents is in the prevention of
acute emesis. they have been less effective in the delayed
setting [20].
 xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ) differs from available serotonin
antagonists in its markedly longer half-life (40 h) and
much greater binding affinity for the type-three serotonin
receptor [19]. in phase i and ii trials,  xxxd2834xxx  has
demonstrated significant antiemetic efficacy with emeto-

genic chemotherapy and a favorable toxicity profile [14].
three phase iii trials have been completed comparing
 xxxd2834xxx  to currently available 5-ht3 antagonists.
two trials with identical design in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy comparing  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and
0.75 mg to  xxxd1924xxx  and ondansetron have recently been
published [24, 25]. the third phase iii trial conducted with
highly emetogenic chemotherapy, also compared  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and 0.75 mg to ondansetron and was reported at the 2003 mascc annual meeting in berlin [1].
the primary endpoint in all three trials was complete response (no emesis/no rescue) in the 24 h after chemotherapy. a number of secondary endpoints, including efficacy in the delayed phase (days 2–5) as well as safety
were also assessed.
one moderately emetogenic trial was conducted in
north america and included 569 patients [24]. in this
study, both the 0.25 and 0.75 mg doses of  xxxd2834xxx 
resulted in superior control of acute and delayed emesis
compared to the comparator,  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg. acute
complete response rates were 63, 57.1, and 52.9% for
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, and  xxxd1924xxx  respectively. corresponding complete response
rates for delayed emesis were 54%, 56.6% and 38.7%
respectively. the differences between both  xxxd2834xxx 
doses and the control were significant only for the delayed phases. a small number of patients (5.4%) received
a corticosteroid in addition to the 5-ht3 antagonist preceding chemotherapy.
similar results were noted in the other moderately
emetogenic trial that was conducted in europe with 563
patients [25]. numerical superiority for both  xxxd2834xxx 
doses was noted for acute and delayed emesis compared to
the comparator, ondansetron 32 mg. acute complete response rates were 81, 73.5, and 68.6% for  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, and ondansetron respectively. the corresponding complete response rates for delayed emesis were 74.1, 64.6, and 55.1% respectively. the
differences were statistically significant for the 0.25 mg
dose of  xxxd2834xxx  in comparison to ondansetron for
control of acute and delayed emesis. no patient in the
european trial received corticosteroids. the pooled efficacy results for these two trials [17]. is displayed in fig. 1.
the third phase iii trial, conducted in north america
and europe, included 667 patients and required patients to

be receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (>80%
cisplatin-based) [1]. unlike the two other phase iii trials,
a majority of patients (67%) received corticosteroids prior
to chemotherapy. again, both the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg
 xxxd2834xxx  arms achieved higher control of acute and
delayed emesis than the ondansetron 32 mg comparator
arm. none of the differences in this trial reached statistical significance. acute complete response rates were
59.2, 65.5, and 57% for the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and
0.75 mg and 32 mg ondansetron arms respectively. the
corresponding complete response rates for delayed emesis
were 45.3, 48, and 38.9% respectively.
treatment was well tolerated in all three phase iii
trials with no significant differences in the frequency of
adverse events noted between either  xxxd2834xxx  dose or
the comparators. the most frequent adverse reactions
were as expected with 5-ht3 antagonists—mild headache
in approximately 10% of patients and constipation in
approximately 5% of patients.
analysis of available data would suggest  xxxd2834xxx 
is an active and well-tolerated new 5-ht3 antagonist. at a
minimum, it may offer advantages of convenience with
respect to current 5-ht3 antagonists given its ability to
improve control of delayed emesis following a single
intravenous dose prior to chemotherapy. additional studies incorporating dexamethasone and repetitive-day conventional  xxxg1116xxx -antagonist dosing will be necessary to define the relative efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx 
compared to available agents.
selective nk1 antagonists
another very promising area that moves beyond serotonin
involves focusing on  xxxg2240xxx  as a potential therapeutic target.  xxxg2240xxx  is a tachykinin found in neurons in the brainstem that mediates a number of biologic
effects [18]. it is the preferred ligand for the neurokinin-1

( xxxg234xxx ) receptor. preclinical studies with selective  xxxg234xxx 
antagonists have demonstrated promising antiemetic activity with a number of different emetic stimuli [22]. two
aspects of the preclinical investigations with the  xxxg234xxx 
antagonists were particularly provocative and differentiated these agents from the serotonin antagonists: (1) their
broad spectrum of antiemetic efficacy [9, 22] and (2) their
remarkable activity in delayed-emesis models [7]. subsequent clinical trials with a number of selective  xxxg234xxx 
antagonists (table 2) for the prevention of cinv have
validated the preclinical promise demonstrated with these
agents and shown their value when used in combination
with 5-ht3 antagonists and corticosteroids [10].
the most extensively evaluated nk1 antagonist to date
has been  xxxd203xxx . phase ii trials of  xxxd203xxx , all conducted with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, have demonstrated: (1) activity as a single agent [5], (2) addition to
a 5-ht3 antagonist and dexamethasone is substantially
more effective than the combination of 5-ht3 antagonist
and dexamethasone alone [3, 15], (3) superiority to placebo and dexamethasone in delayed emesis [3, 4, 15], and
(4) excellent tolerance.
on march 26, 2003,  xxxd203xxx  ( xxxd203xxx ) received
regulatory approval in the united states for use as an
antiemetic in combination with conventional agents for
highly emetogenic chemotherapy. the results of the two
identically designed phase iii trials on which approval
was based were presented at the 2003 meeting of the
american society of clinical oncology [21]. following
the meeting, final results of these trials have been published [16, 26]. patients received cisplatin >70 mg/m2.
the treatment schema for the trials is shown in fig. 2. all
patients received ondansetron 32 mg iv on day 1 prior to
cisplatin. patients on the investigational arm received in
addition dexamethasone 12 mg and  xxxd203xxx  125 mg,
both orally prior to chemotherapy on day 1. on days 2 and
3, they received 80 mg of  xxxd203xxx  and dexamethasone
8 mg daily on days 2–4. patients on the control arm received an  xxxd203xxx  placebo on days 1–3 and dexamethasone 20 mg on day 1 and 16 mg daily days 2–4. the
approximate 50% dose reduction of dexamethasone on
the  xxxd203xxx  arm was designed to compensate for the
anticipated differential dexamethasone exposure based on
the moderate inhibitory capacity of  xxxd203xxx  for the
cyp3a4 metabolic pathway. patients were followed for 5
days after chemotherapy for antiemetic response.

the primary endpoint was complete response (no
emesis, no use of rescue medication) for the entire
5-day study period. in the trial conducted in north
america and europe (protocol 052), 520 patients were
treated [26]. overall complete response was 73 and
52% in the  xxxd203xxx  and control arms respectively
(p<0.001). similar results were noted in the other phase
iii trial (protocol 054) conducted in south america with
523 patients treated [16]. although overall complete
response rates were lower, the magnitude of the difference between study arms was identical. complete response was obtained in 63 and 43% of patients on the
 xxxd203xxx  and control arms respectively in the 054 trial.
combined complete response for the two trials was
72.7% on the  xxxd203xxx  arms versus 52.3% on the control arms.
when complete response is broken down for the acute
and delayed periods in the two trials, the superiority of the
 xxxd203xxx  arms is noted in both phases (fig. 3). significantly better control of acute and delayed emesis was
noted in both trials on the  xxxd203xxx -containing arms.
therapy was well tolerated. the overall incidence of
adverse experiences was similar on the two arms. no
significant changes in the toxicity of concomitant therapies—cisplatin; chemotherapy, whether or not metabolized by cyp3a4; or glucocorticoids—was noted. patients were also allowed to continue in a blinded fashion
on protocol therapy for subsequent cycles of treatment up
to maximum of six. for patients able to continue treatment, efficacy appeared to be maintained and treatment
was well tolerated.

fig. 3 results of the two phase iii trials with  xxxd203xxx  in cisplatin-induced emesis. significantly higher rates of complete response for acute and delayed emesis were seen in both trials with
the  xxxd203xxx  arms compared to the control arms [21]

conclusions
continued new agent development over the past 5 years
has resulted in the opportunity to realize the first substantive advances in the management of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting in over a decade. the active
second-generation 5-ht3 antagonist  xxxd2834xxx  may
offer advantages over available 5-ht3 antagonists with
respect to convenience and improved control of delayed
emesis. phase iii trials conducted with this agent to date
have all consistently demonstrated numerical superiority
for  xxxd2834xxx  in comparison with the  xxxd1924xxx  and
ondansetron comparators for the control of acute and delayed emesis. these differences have been most evident
with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. whether these
differences will persist when corticosteroids are added
and studies are conducted with multiple-day conventional
5-ht3 antagonist dosing schedules remains to be seen.
whereas the relative value of  xxxd2834xxx  will be
defined in future trials, the introduction of the first nk1
antagonist,  xxxd203xxx , is a clear-cut treatment advance.
when used in combination with a 5-ht3 antagonist and
dexamethasone, a superior outcome is achieved with
highly emetogenic chemotherapy. many questions remain
on the optimal use of  xxxd203xxx  (combinations, schedules,
value with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy). additional trials are indicated.
