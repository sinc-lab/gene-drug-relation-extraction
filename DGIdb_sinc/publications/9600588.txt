agonist activity of lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  at cloned 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors

received: 19 september 1997 / final version: 31 october 1997

abstract evidence from studies with  xxxd163xxx  hallucinogens indicates that the 5ht2a receptor is the likely target for the initiation of events leading
to hallucinogenic activity associated with lsd and
related drugs. recently,  xxxd2498xxx  (a purported non-hallucinogenic congener of lsd) was reported to be a
potent antagonist at the 5ht2c receptor and an agonist at the 5ht2a receptor. lsd exhibited agonist
activity at both receptors. these data were interpreted
as indicating that the 5ht2c receptor might be the initiating site of action for hallucinogens. to test this
hypothesis, recombinant cells expressing 5ht2a and
5ht2c receptors were used to determine the actions of
lsd and  xxxd2498xxx . lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  were potent
partial agonists at 5ht2a receptors with ec50 values
of 7.2 nm and 17 nm, respectively. also, lsd and
 xxxd2498xxx  were partial agonists at 5ht2c receptors with
ec50 values of 27 nm and 94 nm, respectively. we
conclude that  xxxd2498xxx  and lsd have similar actions at
5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors in recombinant cells. as
agonist activity at brain 5ht2a receptors has been associated with hallucinogenic acitivity, these results indicate that  xxxd2498xxx  may possess hallucinogenic activity,
although the psychopharmacological e¤ects of  xxxd2498xxx

introduction
it is generally accepted that the 5ht2a receptor is
the site of action of the lsd-like hallucinogens,
including phenylisopropylamines such as dom
1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)2-aminopropane)
and tryptamine hallucinogens such as dmt (n,ndimethyltryptamine) (glennon et al. 1984; teitler
et al. 1988; obrien 1996). the 5ht2a receptor is a
member of the 5ht2 receptor sub-family, comprising
the 5ht2a, 5ht2b, and 5ht2c receptors, which are
g-protein coupled receptors linked to the inositol phosphate (ip) signal transduction system (conn et al. 1985,
1986; wainscott et al. 1993). the 5ht2a receptor is
found throughout the brain, with the highest density
of sites in the cerebral cortex (appel et al. 1990). the
5ht2a receptor displays high a¦nity for several
psychotropic drug classes including lsd-like hallucinogens and antipsychotics (glennon et al. 1984;
teitler et al. 1988; roth et al. 1994). there is a strong
correlation between the binding a¦nities of lsd-like
hallucinogenic drugs at the 5ht2a receptor and their
human hallucinogenic potencies. this pharmacological correlation as well as animal models of hallucinogenesis implicate the 5ht2a receptor as the lsd
receptor (glennon et al. 1984; teitler et al. 1988;
geyer and krebs 1994). lsd-like hallucinogenic
compounds act as agonists at the 5ht2a receptor, as

determined by signal transduction studies in which
ip production was measured (sanders-bush et al.
1991). it has also been shown that selective 5ht2
antagonists can reverse the electrophysiological e¤ects
of hallucinogens on the locus coerulus, and the
potencies of the hallucinogens in these electrophysiological studies correlated with their human hallucinogenic potencies (rasmussen and aghajanian
1986).
a recent study reported that the 5ht2c receptor may
be involved in the hallucinogenic process (sandersbush and breeding 1991). the 5ht2c and the 5ht2a
receptors have similar molecular and pharmacological
properties and have similar a¦nities for the  xxxd163xxx  hallucinogens as well as for lsd (teitler
et al. 1987). burris et al. (1991) compared the e¤ects
of lsd and a purported non-hallucinogenic congener
of lsd,  xxxd2498xxx  (a putative anti-parkinsonian agent),
at rat 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors. they reported that
lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  were agonists at the 5ht2a receptor,
whereas  xxxd2498xxx  acted as an antagonist and lsd acted
as an agonist at the 5ht2c receptor (burris et al. 1991).
assuming  xxxd2498xxx  to be non-hallucinogenic, these
authors concluded that the overall actions of  xxxd2498xxx 
and lsd at the 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors implicated the 5ht2c receptor as the site of action of lsd
and lsd-like drugs.
in order to investigate further the roles of the 5ht2a
and 5ht2c receptors in the hallucinogenic activity of
lsd and related drugs, recombinant cells speciþcally
expressing either the 5ht2a or the 5ht2c receptor
(teitler et al. 1990) were used to measure receptor-stimulated ip production by  xxxd2498xxx , lsd, dom and 5ht.
our experimental results indicate that lsd and  xxxd2498xxx 
are agonists at both the 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors,
and imply that  xxxd2498xxx  may possess hallucinogenic
activity, although the overall clinical literature does not
indicate such activity.

materials and methods
radioligand binding
binding studies were performed as described previously (teitler
et al. 1990). brießy, nih-3t3 cells stably transfected with the rat
5ht2a receptor (gf6 cells) were a generous gift from dr. david
julius. a-9 cells stably transfected with the rat 5ht2c receptor were
a generous gift from dr. beth ho¤man (j1 cells). cells were grown
to conßuence and suspended in 50 mm tris-hcl and centrifuged
at 12 000 g for 30 min. the pellet was resuspended in bu¤er and
centrifuged for 20 min. assays were performed in 50 mm trishcl, 0.5 mm edta, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.1 % ascorbate (ph 7.4).
3
h- xxxd2419xxx  (0.5 nm) was used to label the 5ht2a receptor.
3
h-mesulergine (2.0 nm) was used to label the 5ht2c receptor.
competition experiments were performed in triplicate in a 2.0 ml
volume and 10 µm  xxxd2419xxx  (5ht2a) and 1 µm mesulergine
(5ht2c) were used to determine non-speciþc binding. membranes
were incubated for 30 min at 37°c and then þltered on schleicher
and schuell (keene, n.h., usa) glass þber þlters (pre-soaked in
0.1 % polyethyleneimine), and washed with 10 ml bu¤er. the þlters

were counted in a liquid scintillation counter at a 40 % e¦ciency.
competition experiments were plotted and analyzed using
graphpad prism.

phosphatidylinositol metabolism assay
the pi metabolism assay used in the present studies was modiþed
from methods of berridge et al. (1982). twenty four plates were
seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells / well with cells stably transfected
with the 5ht2a or 5ht2c receptor. twenty four hours after
plating the cells, 0.25 µci 3h- xxxd2360xxx  was added and the cells
were incubated for 18 h in inositol-free, serum-free dmem
(gibco). cells were rinsed with pbs and then incubated in serumfree media with 10 mm licl and 10 µm  xxxd2850xxx  for 15 min. these
procedures have been shown to essentially eliminate residual 5ht
from the assay medium (barker et al. 1994). drugs were added to
the recombinant cells and incubated in serum-free and inositol-free
media for 30 min. the reactions were terminated by removing the
media and adding 0.25 ml stop solution (1 m koh, 7.6 mm naoh,
18 mm na borate, and 3.8 mm edta) and 0.25 ml of a neutralization solution (7.5 % hcl). samples were extracted with
methanol : chloroform (2 : 1) and loaded onto anion-exchange
columns (ag-1x8 formate resin; bio-rad). columns were washed
with 10 ml 5 mm  xxxd2360xxx  and 10 ml 5 mm sodium
borate / 60 mm sodium formate. 3h-inositol phosphates were eluted
with 3 ml 1 m ammonium formate / 100 mm  xxxd2154xxx . ecoscint
17 ml was added to each tube and counted in a liquid scintillation
counter at 40 % e¦ciency.
ki, ec50, ic50 values and concentration-response curves were
generated using graphpad prism. statistical analyses were done
using a students t-test.

results
radioligand binding studies show that lsd and
 xxxd2498xxx  have high a¦nity for 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors (table 1). preliminary experiments using 1 µm
concentrations of drugs indicated that lsd,  xxxd2498xxx 
and dom, a well-characterized  xxxd163xxx 
hallucinogen, possess agonist activity at the 5ht2a and
5ht2c receptors. at 1 µm lsd,  xxxd2498xxx , and dom
produced 5-fold, 4-fold and 14-fold increases, respectively, over basal ip levels at 5ht2a receptors (data not
shown). at 5ht2c receptors, lsd,  xxxd2498xxx  and dom
produced 3.6-fold, 2.3-fold and 10-fold increases,
respectively, in ip levels (data not shown). 5ht produced a 15-fold stimulation over basal levels at both
receptors. to characterize further the agonist activity
of lsd,  xxxd2498xxx , and dom, dose-response curves were
generated (fig. 1). lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  potently stimulated the 5ht2a receptor with ec50 values of 7 nm
and 17 nm, respectively and the 5ht2c receptor with
ec50 values of 27 nm and 94 nm, respectively
(table 1). 5ht stimulated 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors
with ec50 values of 61 nm and 77 nm, respectively.
figure 1 indicates that lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  are partial
agonists at 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors. lsd had an
e¦cacy of 32 % and 26 % at 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors, respectively (t-value, df 9.2,4; 12,4) (table 1).
similarly,  xxxd2498xxx  had an e¦cacy of 26 % and 17 % at

these studies were performed to determine the actions
of lsd,  xxxd2498xxx  (a purported non-hallucinogenic congener of lsd), and dom (an lsd-like) hallucinogenic  xxxd163xxx ) at 5ht2a and 5ht2c
receptors heterologously expressed in recombinant
mammalian cell lines. we took advantage of a recombinant cell line to obtain a system in which receptors
are expressed at a high density : thus the e¦cacy of
weak partial agonists that may be undetectable in other
systems is easily measurable in recombinant cells. lsd
and  xxxd2498xxx  were found to act similarly at 5ht2a and
5ht2c receptors, displaying partial agonist activity at
both receptors. dom displayed full agonist activity at
5ht2a receptors and close to full activity at 5ht2c
receptors, relative to the endogenous neurotransmitter
5ht. the key observation in this study was the agonist activity of  xxxd2498xxx  at the 5ht2c receptor, as a
previous report had indicated that  xxxd2498xxx  was an
antagonist at the 5ht2c receptor (burris et al. 1991).
the e¤ects of lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  we observed are consistent with the reports of partial agonist activity of
lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  at 5ht2a receptors in signal transduction measurements in primary cell cultures (burris
et al. 1991) and the partial agonist activity of lsd at
5ht2a receptors using electrophysiological techniques
(marek and aghajanian 1996).
burris et al. (1991) reported that  xxxd2498xxx  is an antagonist at 5ht2c receptors in rat choroid plexus epithelial cells. citing the accepted observation that  xxxd2498xxx 
does not produce the obvious hallucinogenic activity
associated with lsd and related hallucinogenic drugs
of abuse, they proposed that the pharmacological

proþle of lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  at the 5ht2a and 5ht2c
receptors indicated that the 5ht2c may be a more likely
candidate for the key receptor mediating the e¤ects
of lsd and lsd-like hallucinogens. our results
indicate that  xxxd2498xxx  has partial agonist activity
at the 5ht2c receptor, similar to that of lsd. the
observation that  xxxd2498xxx  could antagonize 5ht
stimulation of 5ht2c receptors is expected due to
the partial agonist activity of  xxxd2498xxx . it is well
established that partial agonists, especially those with

low e¦cacy such as  xxxd2498xxx , will antagonize the activity of full agonists. the important point is that our
studies indicate that  xxxd2498xxx  and lsd can display
partial agonist activity at both the 5ht2a and 5ht2c
receptors.
 xxxd2498xxx  is classiþed primarily as a dopamine receptor agonist, although it possesses agonist activity at
5ht2a, 5ht2c,  xxxg1108xxx , and adrenergic receptors.
 xxxd2498xxx  is occasionally used as an anti-parkinsonian
agent, due to its d2 dopamine receptor agonist actions
(gershanik et al. 1988). several studies have compared
the activity of  xxxd2498xxx  and lsd in whole animal
models.  xxxd2498xxx  has been generally regarded as nonhallucinogenic and has been reported to di¤er in its
actions in comparison to its hallucinogenic congener,
lsd. in drug discrimination studies, rats have been
reported to discriminate lsd from  xxxd2498xxx  in a twolever paradigm (white and appel 1982; winter 1994).
in studies in which  xxxd2498xxx  mimicked lsd in rats and
monkeys, it was proposed that dopamine receptors play
a predominant role in the drug stimulus e¤ects of
 xxxd2498xxx , and only a secondary role in the lsd cue
(holohean et al. 1982; nielsen 1985). in electrophysiological studies, lsd has been found to potentiate
the excitomodulatory e¤ect of 5ht on glutamic acidinduced excitations in the rat facial motor nucleus,
while  xxxd2498xxx  exhibited no potentiation of 5ht
(mccall and aghajanian 1980). di¤erences in the
pharmacological properties of lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  were
also apparent in locomotor activity studies where
 xxxd2498xxx  failed to mimic the e¤ects of lsd and resembled the activity produced by apomorphine (adams
and geyer 1985).
several drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that rats respond similarly upon the administration of lsd and  xxxd2498xxx , and in lsd-trained
monkeys,  xxxd2498xxx  can substitute for lsd (nielsen
1985; white 1986).  xxxd2498xxx , at low doses, has been
found partially to generalize to a dom stimulus,
which has been well characterized as a 5ht2a receptor response (glennon and hauck 1985). in whole
animal studies,  xxxd2498xxx  demonstrated 5ht2a agonist
activity (marini et al. 1981). also,  xxxd2498xxx  induces
a head-twitch response in rats and shrews (grano¤
et al. 1992; darmani et al. 1994), a well characterized
5ht2a receptor agonist-induced response. taken
together, these data suggest that  xxxd2498xxx  can mimic
lsd in some animal models. however, the psychopharmacological information on  xxxd2498xxx  do not
support classifying  xxxd2498xxx  as a hallucinogen, as there
is no substantial literature reporting acute lsd-like
e¤ects of this drug. there are a few reports that are
suggestive of some psychotomimetic activity of
 xxxd2498xxx , including visual hallucinations; dreamlike
feelings; and increased perception of external stimuli
(lewitt et al. 1982; nutt et al. 1985; todes 1986;
critchley et al. 1988; fernandez pardal et al. 1988;
gershanik et al. 1988; obeso et al. 1988; vaamende

413

et al. 1991). the prevailing sense is that these e¤ects
are associated with chronic dopamine receptor agonist
treatment, and are observed with other anti-parkinsonian regimens.
in summary, our data using recombinant cells
expressing 5ht2a or 5ht2c receptors indicate that
lsd and  xxxd2498xxx  are partial agonists at both receptors.
the reasons for a previous report indicating that
 xxxd2498xxx  was an antagonist at the 5ht2c receptor may
have to do with the system in which the studies were
performed, a primary culture derived from rat choroid
plexus (burris et al. 1991). due to a di¤erent stoichiometry of receptors and g-proteins that generally
exists in recombinant cells allowing for more e¦cient
coupling of the receptor and g-protein, weak partial
agonist e¤ects are readily observed. with the exception
of a few compounds, experimental data from recombinant cells have been consistent with studies from
choroid plexus. however, the e¤ects produced by lsd
and lsd-related hallucinogens in choroid plexus
epithelial cells and recombinant cells may di¤er from
the e¤ects of hallucinogens at neuronal 5ht2c receptors, due to the di¤erence in the cell biology of the two
systems. in more recent work, sandersbush and coworkers have observed 5ht2c agonist activity of
 xxxd2498xxx  in recombinant cells expressing 5ht2c receptors (personal communication). as the agonist activity
of  xxxd2498xxx  at the 5ht2a receptor and antagonist
activity at the 5ht2c receptor were interpreted as indicating that the 5ht2c receptor displayed a pharmacological proþle more consistent with the site-of-action
of lsd-like hallucinogens (burris et al. 1991), the agonist activity of  xxxd2498xxx  reported herein indicates that
the 5ht2a receptor remains a more likely candidate as
the key receptor triggering the hallucinogenic e¤ects of
lsd and related drugs. however, a contribution from
5ht2c receptors cannot be eliminated, based on the
information available at this time.
