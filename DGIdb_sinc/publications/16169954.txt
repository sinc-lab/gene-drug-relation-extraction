introduction
fluid-secreting epithelia must achieve high fluxes of cations,
anions, water and other solutes. a striking exemplar of such
transport is offered by the malpighian (renal) tubules of
insects, which, when maximally stimulated, are capable of
transporting their own cell volumes of fluid every 10·s – rates
unmatched elsewhere in biology (dow and davies, 2003;
maddrell, 1991). in insects, an apical plasma membrane vatpase energises a proton/alkali-metal cation exchanger,
thought to prefer potassium over sodium (wieczorek et al.,
1999). potassium enters the cell from the basolateral surface
through a combination of a ouabain-sensitive na+/k+-atpase
(torrie et al., 2004), a na+/k+/2cl– cotransporter (ianowski
and o’donnell, 2004) and barium-sensitive potassium
channels (beyenbach and masia, 2002; masia et al., 2000;
weltens et al., 1992); their relative importance may vary
between insects. present estimates suggest that, in drosophila,
each contributes approximately equally to the k+ flux (torrie
et al., 2004). at a transepithelial level, therefore, potassium

appears to be actively transported. the route for the passive
anion shunt is controversial; but in drosophila, it is regulated
by stellate cells (denholm et al., 2003; o’donnell et al., 1996;
radford et al., 2002); there is evidence that these cells also
contain aquaporins (dow et al., 1995; kaufmann et al., 2004),
so providing a low-resistance shunt pathway for both anions
and water.
drosophila melanogaster, despite its small size, offers unique
advantages for the study of epithelial physiology, and
accordingly, the molecular basis of d. melanogaster renal
function is now understood in considerable detail (dow and
davies, 2001, 2003). among the tools available to the
drosophila community is a comprehensive affymetrix
microarray, which allows gene expression to be studied
quantitatively over space and time. a recent such study,
comparing adult drosophila tubule with whole flies, identified
genes that are either abundantly expressed or highly enriched in
tubule (wang et al., 2004). thus, this study both identifies

candidate genes for known transport and signalling functions
and suggests new, previously unsuspected functions. among the
significant findings of this study was the observation that, of the
very large k+ channel gene family of drosophila, all three of
the inward rectifier drosophila genes (ir,  xxxg1251xxx  and irk3) were
both highly abundant and strongly enriched (to much greater
extents than any other k+ channels), clearly implicating inward
rectifier potassium channels (irks) in epithelial function.
mammalian irks form both homo- and hetero-tetramers
and are sensitive to barium and to the antidiabetic
sulphonylureas such as  xxxd2215xxx  (bryan and aguilarbryan, 1997). possible orthologues expressed in mammalian
kidney include kir6.x and kir1.x. these channels are often
associated with abc transporters, such as cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and
sulphonylurea receptor (sur), and complexes with these
receptors render the channels more sensitive to  xxxd2215xxx 
(ruknudin et al., 1998).
the highly upregulated expression pattern of the irks
prompted our investigation into the effect of sulphonylureas on
the malpighian tubules. not only do sulphonylureas inhibit
fluid secretion, but  xxxd2215xxx  blocks organic dye excretion
by the tubule, and  xxxd2215xxx  itself is both excreted and
modified by the tubule.

and drosophila corticotropin releasing factor-like peptide
(dcrf, dh; cabrero et al., 2002) were added at 60·min, then
the secretion rate recorded for a further hour. in this way, the
impact of sulphonylureas could be assessed both on resting and
maximally stimulated fluid secretion.

materials and methods
drosophila
oregon r flies were kept on standard medium in tubes at
25°c, 12·h:12·h photoperiod and 55% relative humidity. for
dissection, flies were anaesthetized by chilling on ice and
decapitated before dissecting out tubules in schneider’s
medium (invitrogen, paisley, scotland, uk). all chemicals
and drugs were obtained from sigma, unless otherwise stated.

in situ hybridization
tubules were dissected, fixed and subjected to in situ
hybridization according to published protocols (siviter et al.,
2000) and the berkeley drosophila genome project (bdgp)
96-well in situ protocol (http://www.fruitfly.org/about/
methods/rnainsitu.html). in situ probes were directed
towards the 3⬘ utr of each gene to minimise crosshybridisation between related genes. pcr products derived
from the 3⬘ utr of each gene were cloned into pbluescript or
pcrii vectors (invitrogen), and dig-labelled rna probes
were generated by in vitro transcription. adult tissues
comprising gut, testes, ovaries and malpighian tubules were
dissected in schneider’s medium (invitrogen) and placed into
wells of a millipore 96-well plate (magvn22 or magvs22)
with 100·␮l schneider’s medium. schneider’s medium was
removed using a vacuum pump, and postfix solution
[10·mmol·l–1 potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) containing
140·mmol·l–1 nacl, 0.1% tween 20 and 5% v/v formaldehyde]
was added for 20·min, followed by three washes with pbt
[10·mmol·l–1 potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) containing

secretion assay
fluid secretion assays were performed as described (dow et
al., 1994), taking readings every 10·min.  xxxd2215xxx  was
added after the tubule basal secretion rate had been measured
for 30·min. the secretion rate continued to be recorded for a
further hour. inhibition was calculated as the difference
between the basal rate (measured over the first 30·min) and the
secretion rate at 50·min. to study the effects of  xxxd2215xxx 
on neuropeptide-stimulated secretion,  xxxd2215xxx  was
added at 30·min, and the diuretic peptides drosophila
leucokinin ( xxxg604xxx ; radford et al., 2002; terhzaz et al., 1999)

real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr)
qpcr was performed as described previously (mcgettigan
et al., 2005). briefly, mrna was prepared from 7-day-old
oregon r flies or their tubules using qiagen rnaeasy column,
following the manufacturer’s methods (qiagen, crawley, west
sussex, uk). reverse transcription was carried out using
superscript ii (invitrogen) using oligo-dt primer. for each
sample, 500·ng of cdna was added to 25·␮l of sybr green
reaction mix (finnzymes, gri, braintree, essex) and
appropriate primers (table·1). an opticon 2 thermocycler (mj
research, now bio-rad, hemel hempstead, herts, uk) was set
as follows; the recommended 15·min hotstart taq activation
time, then 40 cycles of (denaturing at 94°c for 30·s, annealing
for 30·s at primer-dependent temperature, 30·s of extension at
72°c, and 10·s absorption reading at 80°c), followed by a 5·min
final extension at 72°c and a melting curve from 70°c to 90°c.
the ribosomal rp49 gene was used as a standard in all
experiments. data were then expressed as fold difference of
tubule cdna compared with whole fly cdna (± s.e.m.).

care to seal the wells with parafilmtm to prevent evaporation.
following hybridisation, the samples were washed four times

100·mmol·l–1 nacl, 50·mmol·l–1 mgcl2] for 5·min then
repeated again. the colour reaction was initiated by the
addition of dig detection buffer + 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl

10·min–2·h at room temperature. development was stopped
with extensive washing with pbt containing 50·mmol·l–1

on slides with 70% glycerol and viewed on an axioscope
microscope equipped with an axiocam imaging system (zeiss,
welwyn garden city, uk).
confocal imaging
tubules were dissected and mounted on poly-lysine-coated
slides in schneider’s medium.  xxxd2215xxx  labelled with
texas red (molecular probes, now invitrogen) was added to
a final concentration of 0.1·mmol·l–1. a time series was
generated under fluorescence with a zeiss 510 meta confocal
system. all images were taken at the same
gain and exposure and processed using
axiovision 3.0.6 software.

secretion assays, performed as described
above. secreted fluid was collected for 1·h, the

(fisher scientific uk, loughborough, leicestershire, uk).
transport ratios were calculated as the ratio of specific
activities of secreted drop: reservoir bubble (values >1 thus
imply concentration of the label by the tubule).

a fuji phosphorimager.

results
qpcr measurement of expression levels of drosophila irks
although microarray data provide a valuable first-pass
survey of gene expression levels, it is prudent to validate array
‘hits’ independently before engaging in detailed study. the
mean ratio results from qpcr analysis (table·2) showed that
all three irk-encoding genes were enriched in tubule,
compared with whole fly, cdna, confirming previous
affymetrix microarray results (wang et al., 2004). while the
actual values produced from the qpcr and affymetrix mas5
analyses differ slightly, the relative levels between the genes
are maintained; this represents further validation of the
microarray dataset beyond the 12 genes originally subjected to
qpcr (wang et al., 2004).
one of these genes,  xxxg1251xxx , was known to have two splice
forms (fig.·1), although the affymetrix probes (against the 3⬘
end of the mrna) would not have distinguished them. qpcr
measurement allowed the identification of  xxxg1251xxx -ra as the
major transcript (table·1). these results also suggested the
presence of an additional splice form, verified by cloning and
sequencing the pcr product. this new splice form, which will
be denoted rc, has an extra 21 bases prior to the translated
region of the ra splice form (fig.·1). it appears to be a low-

irk3 (table·2), there was widespread expression in all regions
except the initial and transitional segments of the anterior
tubules; interestingly, the equivalent regions of the posterior
tubules stained throughout (fig.·4). additionally, within the

this ratio is approximate, because a quantitative real-time pcr

the principal cell being the major route for active potassium
flux through the tubule: v-atpases are also highly enriched in

this cell type (sözen et al., 1997), as in another dipteran, aedes
aegypti (weng et al., 2003). irk3 was also observed in
developing oocytes (fig.·4f).
the other two genes gave fainter signals, but both were still
clearly expressed in tubule principal cells. however, ir was
most abundantly expressed in the ureter (fig.·2), whereas  xxxg1251xxx 
was most abundant in spermatheca (fig.·3a). it is thus
clear that, although all genes contribute to main segment
function, ir and irk3 are also found in lower tubule, a region
associated with fluid reabsorption (o’donnell and maddrell,
1995). irks may thus play a role both in secretion and
reabsorption in distinct spatial regions of the tubule. as the
genes are extensively co-expressed in the tubule, and as irks
can form hetero-tetramers, there is a possibility that the
properties of the channels in vivo may not resemble those
measured by heterologous expression in vitro (doring et al.,
2002).
as the electrochemical gradient at the apical membrane does
not favour net k+ secretion (beyenbach et al., 2000), it is also
likely that irks will be located on the basolateral membrane.
could they then constitute a major route for k+ entry?

inward rectifier potassium channels in drosophila 3777

sur may not be associated with irks in tubule
diflubenzuron is a competitor for  xxxd2215xxx  binding
to sur in drosophila (abo-elghar et al., 2004). in secretion
assays where diflubenzuron was added, followed 30·min
later by  xxxd2215xxx , no change in secretion rate was
observed (fig.·7). inhibition by  xxxd2215xxx  was
unaffected, suggesting that  xxxd2215xxx  is not binding to
sur. microarray results (wang et al., 2004) showed that
sur was not abundant in the malpighian tubule; however,
it was envisaged that there might be a functional homologue.
the results from the diflubenzuron and ic50 experiments
suggest that the irk channels in the tubule do not form
complexes similar to the kir6.x/sur complexes in
mammals, although they do not exclude the possibility that
 xxxd2215xxx  is acting on a target distinct from irk, such
as cftr. however, no drosophila orthologues for cftr
were identified in a survey of drosophila abc transporters
(dean et al., 2001).
amaranth secretion is inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx 
amaranth, an innocuous red food dye, was observed to be
concentrated in secreted fluid (maddrell and gardiner, 1975)
and is widely used to help view the secreted bubbles in
secretion assays (dow et al., 1994); however, the mechanism
of active amaranth secretion is unknown. during the secretion
assay, amaranth transport was observed to be inhibited by
 xxxd2215xxx . amaranth transport was abolished after 35·min

sulphonylureas block fluid secretion
the cardinal inhibitors of irks are the antidiabetic
sulphonylureas such as  xxxd2215xxx  (inagaki et al., 1996).
consistent with a major role for irks in tubule, fluid secretion
was found to be inhibited by sulphonylureas.  xxxd2215xxx 
inhibited fluid secretion with an ic50 of 0.78±0.03·mmol·l–1
(fig.·5). maximal inhibition was observed 20–40·min after the
drug was added, depending on concentration. the ic50 value
is comparable with those found in mammalian  xxxg1249xxx  channels
in the absence of sur2b (konstas et al., 2002) and tenebrio
molitor tubules (wiehart et al., 2003).
to characterize the sulphonylurea sensitivity of the tubule
further,  xxxd3394xxx , minoxidil and  xxxd1868xxx  were also tested
and shown to inhibit secretion (fig.·6). approximate ic50
values for these drugs were estimated as 5·mmol·l–1,
0.01·mmol·l–1 and 0.1·mmol·l–1, respectively.  xxxd3394xxx  has
a lower binding efficiency to surs than  xxxd2215xxx 
(dorschner et al., 1999) and is often shown to require
approximately 10 times the concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  in
order to produce the same effects. although minoxidil is a
 xxxg1232xxx  activator, it has also been shown to decrease
urine produce in humans (wang, 2003), as was found here. it
is thus clear that tubule secretion is inhibited by a range of
sulphonylureas, with very similar pharmacology to humans.
on balance, however, the relatively high ic50s suggest that
either the tubule irks are of the lower affinity class that do
not need to associate closely with an sur or that there are
additional targets for sulphonylureas in tubule.

when the concentration of  xxxd2215xxx  was greater than
0.1·mmol·l–1, and some inhibition was observed above
0.01·mmol·l–1 (fig.·8). inhibition of amaranth transport thus
occurs at  xxxd2215xxx  concentrations tenfold lower than the
ic50 for  xxxd2215xxx  action on fluid secretion, and so shows
that the two effects are independent actions of  xxxd2215xxx .
 xxxd2215xxx  was further found to block orange r and
phenol red transport (data not shown). the inhibition of
amaranth transport suggested that  xxxd2215xxx  may be
preferentially transported via the same mechanism as
amaranth.
further secretion assays demonstrated that phenol red and
amaranth did not impact on the inhibition of fluid secretion by
 xxxd2215xxx . in secretion assays where no dye was added to
the reservoir bubble, the reduction of secretion caused by
 xxxd2215xxx  was not significantly different (fig.·9).
 xxxd2215xxx  is both transported and metabolized by tubule
the serendipitous observation that  xxxd2215xxx  blocked
the transport of a wide range of organic dyes by tubule
suggested a second action of sulphonylureas in tubule; an
impact on organic solute transporters. we hypothesized that
this might reflect competition for the same excretory

transporters; tubules are known to express a huge repertoire of
broad-specificity solute transporters (wang et al., 2004).
accordingly, possible transport of  xxxd2215xxx  was observed
using confocal microscopy. the fluorescent  xxxd2215xxx 
appeared initially to adhere to the basolateral membrane,
before entering the cells (fig.·10). the fluorescent
 xxxd2215xxx  was observed in the cytoplasm of the principal
cells; this occurs along the length of the tubule. the basolateral
border between the principal cell and stellate cells also showed
up clearly. there was a particularly strong signal from the
initial segment of the anterior tubules, a region that does not
contribute to fluid secretion (o’donnell and maddrell, 1995)
but that actively excretes calcium (dube et al., 2000). at the
urethra, fluorescent secreted bubbles were visible.
the nature of the  xxxd2215xxx  transport was investigated
further using i125-labelled  xxxd2215xxx . measurements of the
radioactivity in the secreted drops and reservoir bubbles
revealed that the level of radioactivity was approximately 8fold higher than the bathing solution in the secreted drops
across all  xxxd2215xxx  concentrations investigated
(fig.·11b). the rate of secretion rose with the  xxxd2215xxx 
concentration (fig.·11a). the rate and ratio measurements
show that  xxxd2215xxx  transport certainly occurs and that the
mechanism was saturated at the highest concentration we were

transport across an adverse electrochemical gradient. however,

fig.·8.  xxxd2215xxx  blocks amaranth transport. eight tubules were arranged radially for classical (ramsay) secretion assays (dow et al., 1994):
the bathing drops are just out of shot. droplets were collected every 10·min, and so the colour of the droplets provides a correlate of real-time
amaranth transport. (a) secreted drops before  xxxd2215xxx  was added. (b) secreted droplets 35·min after  xxxd2215xxx  was added to the final

bubbles was 2·␮mol·l–1.

 xxxd2215xxx  inhibition mimics the effect of k+-free saline
 xxxd2215xxx , although a classical inhibitor of irks, has
also been shown to act on a wide range of targets. for example,
it blocks abc transporters other than sur, such as cftr
(zhang et al., 2004). it has been argued to affect l-type
calcium channels and the na+/k+-atpase (lee and lee, 2005)
and to induce a chloride conductance in mitochondria that
collapses the inner membrane potential (fernandes et al.,
2004). so, it is premature to ascribe the potent inhibition of
tubule secretion by  xxxd2215xxx  to blockade of irks.
however, our confidence is increased by the fact that a range
of sulphonylureas, and not just  xxxd2215xxx , are effective
(fig.·6). is it possible to go further?
the effects of  xxxd2215xxx  were compared with exposure
of the tubule to k+-free saline. drosophila tubule secretion has
been reported to persist for some hours in k+-free saline
(linton and o’donnell, 1999), so if the action of  xxxd2215xxx 
was at a site distinct from irks, then secretion in k+-free saline
should still be sensitive to  xxxd2215xxx . however, in our
experiments, k+-free saline led to a total inhibition of fluid
secretion, with a time course very similar to that of
 xxxd2215xxx  addition, and so  xxxd2215xxx  has no further
effect on tubules in k+-free saline (fig.·12). we thus consider
that the action of  xxxd2215xxx  is consistent with a run-down
of cellular k+, similar to that produced by removing external
k+, although, given the multiple potential targets of
 xxxd2215xxx , we cannot rule out more complex possibilities.
discussion
microarray analysis is a potent tool, but all the more so when
it directs downstream functional analysis. fortunately, the
drosophila renal tubule is an ideal tissue for such study.

fig.·9. anionic dyes do not impact on  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition of
fluid secretion. classical secretion assays were performed in normal
medium or with the addition of phenol red (2⫻10–5·mol·l–1) or
amaranth (2⫻10–5·mol·l–1).  xxxd2215xxx  (final concentration
10–4·mol·l–1) was added after 30·min. secretion rates are shown as
means ± s.e.m. (n=6).

microarray analysis clearly implicated irks in tubule function,
and this paper has confirmed the abundance and enrichment of
mrnas for all three drosophila irks and further localised
them to the principal cell, which is known to be the site of
active electrogenic cation transport. this builds on previous in
situ data, which have variously described ir as widely
expressed (maclean et al., 2002), especially in embryonic
salivary gland, and localises  xxxg1251xxx  to embryonic hindgut and
irk3 to embryonic malpighian tubules (doring et al., 2002).
our data show that, in adults, all three irks are present in
tubule. as irks form both homo- and hetero-tetramers (bryan
and aguilar-bryan, 1997), there is thus ample scope for
sophistication in tubule k+ channel expression. interestingly,
the three irks show overlapping, but distinct, patterns of
expression; irk3 is expressed in main segment principal cells
and lower tubule, implying a role in both fluid secretion and
reabsorption.

 xxxd2215xxx  transport in specific areas of the tubule: (e) urethra; (f) surface of the main segment, showing the stellate cells; (g) main segment;
(h) initial segment of anterior tubule. images a–d were taken 40·min after the addition of 0.1·mmol·l–1 tr- xxxd2215xxx . images i–l were
taken of the same regions of the tubule as e–h but were not exposed to tr- xxxd2215xxx . the same detector gain (0.01) and off-set amplification
(500) were used for all images. tubule diameters can be taken as 35·␮m throughout.

as would be expected, fluid secretion was shown to be
sensitive to a wide range of the antidiabetic sulphonylureas that
are selective inhibitors of irks in vertebrates. the sensitivity
to these drugs, however, was not sufficiently high to suggest
that these irks are associated with drosophila sur or a
related  xxxg22xxx ; in support of this, a known inhibitor
of drosophila sur had no effect on fluid secretion. however,
it was possible to completely inhibit fluid secretion with
sulphonylureas (fig.·6), whereas inhibitors of na+/k+-atpase
and na+/k+/2cl– co-transport achieve only partial inhibition of
fluid secretion (ianowski and o’donnell, 2004; torrie et al.,
2004), and so, with this broad panel of selective inhibitors, we
can confidently assert a major role for irks in tubule.

do irks participate in basolateral entry of k+?
the extraordinary abundance of mrna for ir,  xxxg1251xxx  and irk3
in tubule (wang et al., 2004; table·2) suggests an important
role for these channels. the sulphonylurea pharmacology,
although less conclusive, shows a similar effect to k+-free
saline, suggesting a possible role for irks in the entry step.
this is consistent with many models for tubule function, in
which basolateral k+ channels have featured (beyenbach et al.,
2000; dow and davies, 2003; wiehart et al., 2003). however,
important basolateral roles have also been shown both for
na+/k+/2cl– co-transport and the na+/k+-atpase (ianowski
and o’donnell, 2004; torrie et al., 2004), and a small (9·mv)
outward electrochemical gradient for k+ has been shown for

the basolateral membrane of resting drosophila tubule
(ianowski and o’donnell, 2004). can this conflicting data be
reconciled? we suggest that irks play only a minor role in
basal secretion: their rectification properties imply that they are

unlikely to let much k+ out, down its electrochemical gradient.
however, when the tubule is maximally stimulated, and the
apical electrogenic v-atpase is driving k+ exit across the
apical membrane, we suggest that basolateral irks allow k+
entry to support the active apical membrane. irks could thus
be seen as adaptations to facilitate the remarkably high per-cell
secretion rates that seem to be characteristic of insect tubules
(dow and davies, 2003; maddrell, 1991). consistent with this,
all the sulphonylureas showed a more marked effect on
stimulated, rather than basal, fluid secretion (fig.·6).
transport and metabolism of  xxxd2215xxx 
we also observed two novel effects of  xxxd2215xxx : (1)
the tubule itself both excretes and modifies the compound and
(2)  xxxd2215xxx  inhibits the excretion of a range of organic
dyes. although the sulphonylureas are valuable human
therapeutic agents, the molecular mechanisms of their
clearance are not understood in detail; for example, it is not
clear whether sur is itself a sulphonylurea transporter.
however, our results may impinge on clearance mechanisms.
although we did not rigorously show competition between
these solutes, it would be a very plausible explanation, and this
paper does identify a range of interesting dyes that may help
in such studies.
demonstration of  xxxd2215xxx  transport further raises the
possibility that the apparent ic50s for sulphonylureas may be
distorted by rapid removal from the basolateral membrane
infoldings of the principal cell, as has been shown for ouabain

the journal of experimental biology

3782 j. m. evans and others
(torrie et al., 2004). this would have the effect of protecting
basolateral irks by only exposing them to a concentration of
sulphonylureas that was significantly lower than the
macroscopic bath concentration, thus producing anomalously
high ic50s. we have not yet identified an inhibitor of
 xxxd2215xxx  transport, so we cannot unmask a higher affinity
effect of  xxxd2215xxx , as was possible for ouabain (torrie et
al., 2004). we must thus be cautious about asserting an
accurate ic50 for  xxxd2215xxx ; this will need to be established
by heterologous expression in culture, where such confounding
elements do not appear.
phylogenetic scope of the model
comparison of the drosophila and anopheles genome
projects reveal that irks are very similar between these
dipteran species; indeed, there appears to have been a gene
expansion in anopheles (mccormack, 2003).  xxxd2215xxx 
sensitivity (at relatively high concentrations: 5·mmol·l–1) has
also been documented in tenebrio molitor, a beetle (wiehart
et al., 2003). in tenebrio, the effect of  xxxd2215xxx  was
similar to that of barium, another characteristic of irks.
barium sensitivity has also been widely documented in tubules
of drosophila (ianowski and o’donnell, 2004; wessing et al.,
1993), the locust schistocerca gregaria (hyde et al., 2001) and
the yellow fever mosquito, aedes aegypti (beyenbach and
masia, 2002) consistent with this, drosophila irks reveal
weak barium sensitivity when expressed heterologously in s2
cells (doring et al., 2002). our results, showing sensitivity of
fluid secretion to a spectrum of sulphonylurea antidiabetics,
and localising all three irks to the same cell type as the apical
v-atpase, may thus have broad scope.
