1 the present study investigated the electrophysiological eects of songorine (1 ± 100 mm), an alkaloid
occurring in plants of the aconitum genus, in rat hippocampal slices.
2 songorine (10 ± 100 mm) evoked a concentration-dependent increase in the amplitude of the
orthodromic population spike and in the slope of the ®eld e.p.s.p. the enhancement was long-lasting
and was not reversed by up to 90 min of washout. songorine failed to aect size and shape of the
presynaptic ®ber spike which represents the compound action potential of the schaer collaterals. this
indicates that enhancement of the synaptic response is no consequence of an increased aerent
excitability.
3 the antidromically evoked population spike was not aected by songorine at concentrations up to
100 mm suggesting that the enhancement of the orthodromic population spike and of the ®eld e.p.s.p.
was not due to an increase in pyramidal cell excitability.
4 the input-output curve for the postsynaptic population spike was shifted to the left implying that a
presynaptic ®ber spike of the same size elicited a larger postsynaptic response, indicating a decrease in
threshold for generation of the population spike.
5 the songorine-evoked increase in excitability was not aected by the nmda receptor antagonist, dap5. however, the eect of songorine was completely abolished by the selective  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist sulpiride (0.1 mm) as well as by haloperidol (10 mm) and was mimicked by application of the
dopamine releaser, amantadine (100 mm). in contrast, the selective  xxxg655xxx  antagonist, sch23390,
did not block the action of songorine.
6 the results indicate that the plant alkaloid songorine enhances excitatory synaptic transmission which
may be due to an agonistic action at d2 receptors.

introduction
songorine is a c20 diterpenoid alkaloid from plants of the
aconitum genus. preparations of aconitum roots are employed
in chinese and japanese medicine as antirheumatics,
analgesics, anaesthetics, and in the treatment of various
neurological disorders (bisset, 1981, han & chen, 1988). the
pharmacological eects are attributed to several diterpenoid
alkaloids, some of which have been isolated in the past (hikino
et al., 1979, han & chen, 1988). songorine was ®rst isolated
from aconitum soongaricum. it is the 12-keto analog of
napelline, which fails to aect neuronal excitability, whereas
its structural analog, 1-benzoylnapelline inhibits neuronal
excitability in rat hippocampal slices (ameri, 1997a). it has
been reported from in vivo studies that the physiological eects
of songorine dier from those of other diterpenoid alkaloids,
for although cardiovascular activity is seen at high doses, the
most noticeable eects are on cns activity (benn & jacyno,
1983). songorine has been shown to exhibit stimulant eects
on the cns (tulyaganov et al., 1978). it has been reported that
subcutaneous administration of 50 ± 100 mg kg71 of songorine
to cats resulted in a stereotypic rocking motion of the head
(benn & jacyno, 1983). furthermore, it has been shown that
the sedative eect of the dopamine receptor antagonist
bulbocapnine is antagonized by songorine (tulyaganov et al.,
1978). with a ld50 of 142.5 mg kg71 (mice, i.v.) the toxicity of
songorine appears to be relatively low (benn & jacyno, 1983).
the aim of the present study was to investigate (1) if
songorine aects neuronal activity in rat hippocampal slices

and (2) if the dopaminergic system contributes to these eects.
a further objective of the present study was to determine
whether songorine acts at a presynaptic or postsynaptic site in
the hippocampal slice.
previous studies have shown that the hippocampus
receives rich dopaminergic innervation from the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (meador-woodru et al., 1991,
1994), and receptor-binding, molecular cloning and in situ
hybridization studies have ascertained the presence in the
hippocampus of both d1 and d2 subtypes of dopaminergic
receptors (kohler et al., 1991; meador-woodru et al.,
1991; mansour et al., 1992). although the eects of
dopamine in the hippocampus are predominantly inhibitory
and result in elevation of spike threshold and slower ®ring
rates (pockett, 1985; malenka & nicoll, 1986; beretta et al.,
1990), dopamine can produce both inhibitory and excitatory
eects on neuronal activity mediated by dopamine d1 and
d2 receptors, respectively. at low concentrations, dopamine
predominantly binds to the  xxxg656xxx  to induce
depolarization accompanied by an increase in the spontaneous ®ring rate and increase in the amplitude of population
spike (gribko & ashe, 1984; smialowski & bijak, 1987;
hsu, 1996; wang et al., 1997). at high concentrations,
dopamine binds to both dopamine d1 and d2 receptors to
evoke a dominant inhibition of spontaneous ®ring of action
potential and hyperpolarization mediated by dopamine d1
receptors.

in the present study, extracellular recordings of stimulusevoked population spikes and ®eld excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (®eld e.p.s.ps.) were studied as a physiological
measure of the pharmacological response to songorine. to
distinguish between pre- and postsynaptic site of action of
songorine the paired-pulse facilitation method was employed.
when a synapse is activated twice with a short interval between
each stimulus, the second response at most synapses, including
excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, is facilitated. this
phenomen is attributed to an increase in the amount of
transmitter release in response to the second stimulus, and
there is strong evidence that residual ca2+ from the ®rst
presynaptic volley increases the probability of transmitter
release to a second volley (hess et al., 1987; zucker, 1989;
debanne et al., 1996). therefore, paired-pulse facilitation is
considered to be an example of purely presynaptic plasticity.
the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation is decreased when
transmitter release is enhanced. no change in the magnitude of
paired-pulse facilitation is consistent with a postsynaptic site of
action (zucker 1989).

methods
brain slice preparation
experiments were performed on hippocampal slices from male
wistar rats (150 ± 180 g). the rats were deeply anaesthetized
with ether and killed by rapid decapitation. the brains were
quickly removed from the skulls and the hippocampus of one
hemisphere was isolated. slices of 400 mm thickness were cut
transversely to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus by use
of a mcilwain tissue chopper. immediately after cutting, one
slice was transferred into a submerged brain slice recording
chamber, where it was continuously perfused with warmed
(328c) acsf at a ¯ow rate of 3 ± 4 ml min71 and held down
on a nylon net by a u-shaped piece of ¯attened platinum wire.
the other slices were maintained at room temperature in an
incubation chamber. the standard acsf was continuously
gassed with a mixture of 95% o2 and 5% co2 and contained
(in mm): nacl 124, kcl 3, nah2po4 1.25, nahco3 26, cacl2
2.5,  xxxd2534xxx  2, glucose 10 at a ph of 7.4.

stimulation and recording
the experimental protocol always included a recovery period
of 1 h after slice preparation. for recordings of stimulusevoked population spikes and ®eld e.p.s.ps, the recording
electrodes were placed in stratum pyramidale and stratum
radiatum of area ca1, respectively. the electrodes were pulled
on a bb-ch-pc electrode puller (mecanex s.a., swiss) from
1.5 mm borosilicate glass and ®lled with 3 m nacl (resistance
5 ± 10 mo). a concentric bipolar stainless steel electrode with
0.25 mm outer diameter (rhodes medical instruments,
u.s.a.) was positioned into the schaer collaterals (i.e. near
the junction of ca1 and ca2 stratum radiatum) or in the
alveus for orthodromic and antidromic activation of ca1
pyramidal neurons, respectively. extracellular stimuli were
rectangular current pulses of 200 ms in duration delivered every
15 s through a digitally controlled stimulus isolation unit
(axon instruments, u.s.a.). at the beginning of each
experiment, the stimulus intensity was adjusted until the
responses to electrical stimulation were about 50% of the
maximal response. in some experiments, stimulus pulses were
delivered in pairs with an interval of 20, 40 and 80 ms between
the stimuli and an interpair interval of 30 s. the response of

effects of songorine

the ®rst stimulus of the pair was used to assess the eect of
songorine on synaptic transmission and the ratio of the second
response to the ®rst was used to assess its eects on pairedpulse facilitation. responses evoked by each 10 consecutive
stimulus pulses were averaged. the signal from the recording
electrode was ampli®ed by means of a dp 301 ampli®er
(warner instruments, u.s.a.). analog data were digitized and
analysed using the data acquisition and analysis software
tida (heka electronic, germany).
only the data of those hippocampal slices have been
included into the present study which showed normal ®eld
potentials (i.e. no second population spike at maximal
stimulation intensity) in response to electrical activation of
schaer collaterals in standard acsf. furthermore, the
amplitudes of the population spikes had to be stable during
a control period of at least 30 min prior to the application of
drugs. during this control period dierences in spike
amplitude had to be below 5%.

drugs
songorine (latoxan, rosans, france) was dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) to give stock solutions of 1 mm.
haloperidol was purchased from sigma (deisenhofen,
germany) and d- xxxd1353xxx , sch-2330- and sulpiride were
purchased from rbi biotrend chemicals (cologne, germany)
and were dissolved in dmso to give stock solutions of 10 mm.
 xxxd136xxx  (sigma, deisenhofen, germany)
was dissolved in distilled water. control experiments have
revealed that the highest ®nal dmso concentration (0.1%) did
not aect any of the measured parameters. these solutions
were diluted with acsf to reach the desired concentrations
and gassed before being perfused into the bathing medium. all
drugs were delivered through the perfusion medium. in all
experiments, each drug application was preceded by a control
period of at least 30 min. in some cases the application of
songorine was preceded by a 30 min application of an
antagonist.

data analysis
mean data are reported as mean+standard deviation (s.d.).
comparisons of the eects of drug treatments (normalized as
percent of control) between groups of slices were performed
using student's t-test for dierences between two independent
means. the statistical signi®cance of the dierence of the
amplitude of the electrophysiological responses prior to and
following the administration of a drug was assessed with the
paired student's t-test. in both cases, dierences were
considered statistically signi®cant when p40.05. the amplitude of the population spike which appears as a large negative
wave superimposed on a positive-going epsp was determined
as the length of a vertical line, drawn from the minimum of the
population spike to the line that joined the two positive peaks
of the ®eld response.

results
eect of songorine on schaer collateral-commissural
synaptic transmission
the eects of songorine on the orthodromic and antidromic
population spike recorded in ca1 stratum pyramidale was
investigated at concentrations between 1 ± 100 mm. at concentrations ranging from 10 ± 100 mm, songorine signi®cantly

a. ameri

increased the orthodromic population spike during 30 min
application in a concentration-dependent manner (table 1,
figure 1). the eect of songorine developed gradually,
reaching a steady-state value in about 20 min. the enhancement of the postsynaptic population spike was long-lasting and
was not reversed by up to 90 min of washout. one mechanism
which could account for the increase in the amplitude of the
postsynaptic population spike is that more presynaptic ®bers
are activated in the presence of songorine than in control. the
excitability of the aerent ®bers (schaer collaterals) innervating the ca1 pyramidal neurons is expressed by the amplitude
of the presynaptic ®ber spike preceding the postsynaptic
population spike. the presynaptic ®ber spike (aerent volley)
represents the compound action potential of the schaer
collaterals and is elicited by their electrical stimulation
(dunwiddie, 1986). however, as shown in figure 1b, the
amplitude of the presynaptic ®ber spike was not aected by the
alkaloid. moreover, the eect of songorine on the antidromically evoked population spike was investigated to determine
whether the drug acts by increasing pyramidal cell excitability.
as shown in figure 2, songorine (10 ± 100 mm) failed to alter
the amplitude of the antidromically evoked population spike
(n=7) indicating a lack of eect on cell excitability.
in order to examine if the eect of songorine is dependent
on stimulation intensity, the input-output relationship for the
orthodromic response was determined. for this purpose,
electrical stimuli of increasing intensity were applied to the
schaer collaterals and the amplitudes of the according
presynaptic ®ber spikes and the postsynaptic population spikes
were measured at control and at the end of a 30 min
application of two dierent concentrations of the alkaloid and
plotted as function of the stimulus-intensity (figure 3). the
input-output curve (figure 3a) indicate that there is no
obvious change in ®ber excitability after application of
songorine as determined by recording the size of the
presynaptic ®ber spike. figure 3b shows that the amplitude
of the postsynaptic spike increased with stimulation intensity
until a maximum was attained. in all slices tested (n=7),
songorine (10 and 30 mm) exerted a concentration-dependent
shift to the left of the curves. the shift to the left means that a
presynaptic ®ber spike of the same size elicited a larger
postsynaptic response, indicating a decrease in threshold for
generation of the population spike.
in order to further investigate whether the enhancement in
the size of the postsynaptic population spike is due to an
increase in transmitter release at the dendrites of the ca1
pyramidal cells, recordings of ®eld e.p.s.ps were performed in

the dendrite region of area ca1 (figure 4). the ®eld e.p.s.p.
re¯ects synaptic currents in the dendrites of the pyramidal
neurones as a result of the action of neurotransmitters. after
30 min of application, the slope of the ®eld e.p.s.p. was
increased by songorine (30 mm) to 121.2+4.1% of control
(n=7, p40.001). the enhancement of the ®eld e.p.s.p. did not
dier signi®cantly from the action of songorine on the
postsynaptic population spike.

paired-pulse facilitation
the shift to the left of the input-output curve (figure 3b) raises
the question of whether the enhancement of the postsynaptic
population spike evoked by songorine occurs presynaptically
or postsynaptically. in order to determine if pre- or
postsynaptic mechanisms underly the increase in the amplitude
of the postsynaptic population spike observed during
application of songorine, the eects of this compound on
paired-pulse facilitation were investigated. paired-pulse facilitation of neurotransmission has been attributed to a
presynaptic process in response to a second stimulus which

triggers a proportionally larger amount of transmitter release

assumed that a decrease in the ratio of the second pulse to the
®rst pulse response (p2/p1) indicates an increase in release
probability. on the other hand, manipulations that depress

transmitter release usually increase the magnitude of p2/p1
(hess et al., 1987; manabe et al., 1993; schulz et al., 1994). if
the songorine-induced enhancement of the orthodromic
population spike involves a presynaptic mechanism of action,
it will be associated with an alteration of the magnitude of p2/
p1. alternatively, if songorine enhances the orthodromic
response by another type of mechanism (e.g. by increasing
the sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors), then presynaptic
events should be relatively unaected. this hypothesis was
tested by comparing the magnitude of p2/p1 before and after

treatment of the slices with songorine (30 mm). in the present
experiments, paired-pulse stimulus induced population spikes
were evoked with stimulus intervals of 20, 40 and 80 ms. at
control, i.e. prior to the application of songorine, the second
response was always larger than the response to the ®rst
stimulus. maximum values of facilitation were achieved with a
stimulus interval of 40 ms. figure 5a shows population
responses to a pair of stimuli with a stimulus interval of
40 ms. using paired stimuli delivered with a 40 ms stimulus
interval, population spikes displayed facilitation of
180.3+12% of control (n=8) when evoked in this manner.

bath application of 30 mm songorine increases the response to
the ®rst stimulus, but decreases the magnitude of this pairedpulse facilitation in all slices tested (132.3+8.4% of control,
n=8). the results from eight experiments for all three stimulus
intervals tested are summarized in figure 5b. however,
recently, it has been shown that the magnitude of paired-pulse
facilitation decreased when the response to the ®rst stimulus
increased (debanne et al., 1996). in order to investigate if the
relative reduction in amplitude of the second spike is due to the
eect of songorine on the response to the ®rst stimulus, further
experiments (n=7) were performed. at the end of the
songorine application, the stimulation intensity was decreased
to return the amplitude of the population spike to its control
value in order to counteract the direct enhancing eect of
songorine on the ®rst spike. at these conditions, however, the
paired-pulse facilitation observed after application of songorine (30 mm) was not signi®cantly reduced (figure 5c and d).
this result suggests that songorine is not likely to act on the
presynaptic site to modulate the transmitter release mechanism
in the ca1 region of rat hippocampus.

antagonist bulbocapnine (tulyaganov et al., 1978), a next
series of experiments was designed, in order to investigate
whether the action of songorine in rat hippocampal ca1
region involves the dopaminergic system. for this purpose,
selective dopaminergic receptor antagonists as well as
amantadine, a dopamine releasing agent, were used to block
or to mimic, respectively, the excitatory eect of songorine.
sch-23390 was used as a selective  xxxg655xxx 
antagonist. the results of these experiments are summarized in
table 1. when sch-23390 (0.1 mm) was applied 30 min prior
to the application of songorine (30 mm), the songorine-induced
sustained enhancement of the postsynaptic population spike
was not altered (figure 6). however, as shown in figure 7, the
selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonist sulpiride (0.1 mm)
completely blocked the enhancement of the orthodromic
population spike induced by 30 mm songorine. moreover, the
dopamine d2/ xxxg655xxx  antagonist haloperidol (10 mm)
abolished the songorine induced eect. there was on eect
of the dopamine receptor antagonists tested in the present
study, when applied prior to songorine.
amantadine, a dopamine releaser, was employed at
concentrations from 1, 10 and 100 mm. bath application of
10 mm amantadine resulted in an increase in spike amplitude to
108.5+2% of control (n=5, p40.01), bath application of

100 mm enhanced the spike amplitude to 119.3+4% of control
(n=7, p40.001). both magnitude of eect of amantadine and
its time-course (figure 8) resembled the action of 10 mm
songorine.

eect of the nmda receptor antagonist d- xxxd1353xxx  on the
songorine-induced eect
as shown in figures 1 and 4, the songorine-induced
enhancement of the orthodromic population spike and the
®eld e.p.s.p. was sustained still after washout of the alkaloid. it
is well known that most forms of long-lasting plasticity in
hippocampal ca1 region require the activation of n-methyld-aspartate (nmda) receptors for their induction (malenka
& nicoll, 1993; bear & abraham, 1996). in order to examine a
possible involvement of nmda receptors in the action of
songorine, a further set of experiments was performed with the
nmda receptor antagonist d- xxxd1353xxx . coapplication of d- xxxd1353xxx 
(10 mm) with 30 mm songorine failed to block the enhancement
of the spike amplitude evoked by the alkaloid (table 1).

discussion
the aim of the present study was to investigate the eects of
the plant alkaloid songorine on central neurons. previously, it

has been reported that songorine has a stimulatory action in
vivo which is likely to involve the dopaminergic system
(tulyaganov et al., 1978; benn & jacyno, 1983).
the present ®ndings provide electrophysiological evidence
that songorine produced a concentration-dependent increase
in the amplitude of the orthodromic population spike and the
®eld e.p.s.p. the enhancement was neither due to an increased
aerent input nor to an enhancement of pyramidal cell
excitability as indicated by the lack of eect on the presynaptic
®ber spike and antidromic population spike, respectively. the
songorine-induced potentiation far outlasted the period of
songorine application and did not require the activation of
nmda receptors, because the enhancement of the spike
amplitude was not abolished by coapplication of the nmda
receptor antagonist d- xxxd1353xxx . due to its excitatory eect, the
action of songorine diers markedly from the action of other
aconitum alkaloids which have been reported recently to
inhibit ca1 excitability (ameri et al., 1997a,b).
in accordance with the above mentioned in vivo studies, the
present ®ndings provide evidence for an involvement of the
dopaminergic system in the eects of songorine. the eects of
songorine were speci®cally antagonized by the selective
 xxxg656xxx  antagonist sulpiride as well as by the
d2/ xxxg655xxx  antagonist haloperidol. in contrast, the
selective  xxxg655xxx  antagonist possessed no signi®cant
inhibitory eect on the sustained enhancement of the
orthodromic population spike evoked by songorine. these
results imply that the alkaloid songorine may act as a
 xxxg656xxx  agonist. furthermore, the ®nding that
the eects of songorine were mimicked by the dopamine
releaser, amantadine, provides additional evidence that the
dopaminergic system is involved in the action of this drug.
these ®ndings are in line with previous ®ndings of tulyaganov
et al. (1978) who have reported that songorine has stimulant
eects in the cns and demonstrated that the sedative eect of
the dopamine d2/ xxxg655xxx  antagonist bulbocapnine is
antagonized by songorine (tulyaganov et al., 1978).
dopamine mediates its eects in mammalian brain through
®ve subtypes of dopaminergic receptors, (d1-d2). dopamine
d1-like receptors (d1 and d5) have been shown to couple to
stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, whereas d2-like
receptors (d2-d4) inhibit this enzyme activity (stoof &
kebabian, 1984; andersen et al., 1990; silbey & monsma,
1992; o'dowd, 1993). all ®ve of the known dopamine receptor
subtypes are expressed in the hippocampus (meador-woodru
et al., 1994) which receives a strong dopaminergic innervation
from the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. dopamine has
both excitatory and inhibitory eects on neuronal excitability

depending on the receptor subtype activated. previously, it has
been demonstrated that dopamine evokes an excitatory
response in rat hippocampal ca1 region which is long-lasting
and which is antagonized by the  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist sulpiride and haloperidol, but not by the d1
receptor antagonist sch-23390 (smialowski & bijak, 1987).
it is still unknown if songorine binds to dopamine receptors, in
particular the  xxxg656xxx .
in the present study, songorine was shown to have no
discernible eect on the shape or size of the presynaptic ®ber
spike, indicating that changes in presynaptic axonal excitability cannot account for the action of songorine on the
postsynaptic population spike. this is supported by the inputoutput curves which revealed that an increase in the number of
presynaptic ®bers activated do not account for the synaptic
enhancement. it is suggested, therefore, that the central eect
of songorine may be a result of either an enhancement of
transmitter release or a result of a postsynaptic action, and it is
unlikely to be due to an increase in axonal excitability.
as demonstrated in figure 3b, songorine caused a shift to
the left of the input-output curve, which means that a
presynaptic ®ber spike of the same size elicited a much larger
postsynaptic response. these results indicate that there is an
additional increase in synaptic eciency during applications of
songorine. schaer collateral-commissural synaptic transmission may have been enhanced by presynaptic or postsynaptic
mechanisms. in order to investigate if songorine potentiates
synaptic transmission at a presynaptic site paired-pulse
stimulation experiments were performed. paired-pulse facilitation, in which the second response to two closely spaced
stimuli is enhanced, has been studied at a number of synapses
and has been attributed to an increase in transmitter release
(hess et al., 1987; zucker, 1989; debanne et al., 1996), and
manipulations which are known to have a presynaptic action
aect the magnitude of the paired-pulse facilitation (muller et
al., 1988). however, debanne et al. (1996) have shown that the
magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation is in¯uenced by the
stimulation intensity. although songorine apparently reduced
the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, it has been shown in
the present study that this eect was due to the enhancing
eect of the alkaloid on the response to the ®rst stimulus. with
respect to the two main ®ndings of the present study (1) the
lack of eect on paired-pulse facilitation by songorine and (2)
the block of action of songorine by the selective  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist sulpiride, it is concluded that this drug does not
seem to evoke its excitatory action by stimulating presynaptic
neurotransmitter release, but rather by activating dopamine d2
receptors.
