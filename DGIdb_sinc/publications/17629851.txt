selectins are adhesion receptors that participate in inflammation and tumor cell
metastasis. the anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of heparins have been
related partly to their ability to interact with p- and l-selectin. the recent findings that
various heparins differ in antimetastatic activity were explained by differences in their
p- and l-selectin binding ability. to obtain data to illustrate the binding characteristics,
we detected for the first time the binding kinetics and affinity of the two low molecular
weight heparins (lmwhs) enoxaparin and  xxxd2690xxx , and of the unfractionated heparin
liquemin n to p- and l-selectin using a quartz crystal microbalance biosensor. enoxaparin and  xxxd2690xxx  behave nearly identical in their binding affinity to both  xxxg2049xxx 
(kd 4.60  10 6 m versus 7.61  10 6 m) and l-selectin (kd 2.01  10 6 m versus
2.84  10 6 m). liquemin n displayed slightly higher affinities to both selectins
(kd 6.07  10 7 m versus 1.07  10 7 m). the differences are caused by a higher
association rate compared with that of the lmwhs. these data support recent findings of
antimetastatic activities, but illustrate that the intrinsic selectin binding does not entirely
reflect the antimetastatic activities in vivo.

hree recent prospective clinical trials and a
post hoc analysis of the clot (randomized comparison of lmwh versus oral anticoagulant therapy for
the prevention of venous thromboembolism in
patients with cancer) study suggest that low molecular
weight heparins (lmwhs) prolong the survival in
patients with advanced malignancy; in particular,
patients with better prognosis benefit from lmwh
therapy.1–5 these clinical data are in line with the
experimentally shown antimetastatic activity of heparins.6,7 however, there are still many unanswered
questions, including those about the mechanism of
the antimetastatic activity of heparins. among the

manifold biological effects of heparins, their ability
to bind to both p- and l-selectin may contribute
considerably to its anti-inflammatory and also antimetastatic activity.8–11
selectins are carbohydrate-binding receptors involved in the leukocyte recruitment during the cellular
immune response.12 although l-selectin is expressed
constitutively on several types of leukocytes,  xxxg2049xxx 
is stored in granula in endothelial cells and platelets,
and rapidly mobilized to the surface upon various
stimuli.13 tumor cells have been shown to express
l- and  xxxg2049xxx  ligands that enable them to interact
with the endothelium, platelets, and leukocytes during

abstract

ability of heparins to bind with p- and l-selectin/simonis et al

 xxxg2049xxx , but not with their in vitro p- and l-selectin
binding kinetics. this emphasizes the importance of
several steps of the in vivo processing of heparins as
factors affecting the activity.

experimental procedures
materials
recombinant human  xxxg2049xxx –fc chimera and l-selectin–fc chimera were purchased from r&d systems
(wiesbaden, germany). purified mouse immunoglobulin g (igg) 1-kappa was purchased from becton dickinson gmbh (heidelberg, germany). bovine serum
albumin (bsa) and cyanuric chloride were from sigma
(deisenhofen, germany). 6-mercaptohexan-1-ol was
purchased from fluka (neu-ulm, germany), and
chloroform was from riedel-de haen (seelze, germany).
all salts and buffers were of analytical grade.
sulfated polysaccharides

ufh was supplied as liquemin n 5000 (lot no.
f002611; 5000 iu/0.5 ml; average molecular weight
[mw], 15 kd). lmwhs were supplied as enoxaparinsodium ( xxxd1997xxx ; sanofi-aventis germany gmbh,
frankfurt am main, germany; ch.-b. 92012; 2000
iu/0.2 ml; average mw, 4.5 kd) and nadroparincalcium ( xxxd2690xxx ; glaxosmithkline gmbh & co.
kg, munich, germany; ch.-b. 53283; 1900 iu/0.2
ml; average mw, 4.5 kd).
preparation of the quartz crystal surface

quartz crystals were cleaned using piranha solution
(h2o2 concentrate/h2so4 concentrate 1:3) and subsequently rinsed with demineralized water. this procedure
was repeated three times. the quartz crystals were rinsed
with ethanol (96% vol/vd) and dried under a stream of
synthetic air. the cleaned quartz crystals were added to a
1 mm chloroform solution of 6-mercaptohexan-1-ol.
after 12 hours at room temperature (rt), a thiolfunctionalized monolayer was formed. the quartz crystals
were rinsed briefly with ethanol and dried under a stream
of synthetic air. then the quartz crystals were put into a
chloroform solution of cyanuric chloride (1% mass/vd) for
2 hours at rt, again followed by ethanol washing and
drying. the cyanuric chloride acted as a reactive linker
onto the immobilized 6-mercaptohexan-1-ol for coupling
the  xxxg2049xxx –fc chimera. a solution of 20 ml
 xxxg2049xxx –fc-chimera in phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs; 0.2 mg/ml) and 20 ml borate buffer (ph 8.8)
was pipetted onto the upper gold surface of the quartz
sensors. after 2 hours at rt, the quartz crystals were
rinsed with demineralized water and dried under a stream
of air. for blank experiments, a solution of 20 ml bsa
(20% mass/vd) in water was used instead of the
 xxxg2049xxx –fc chimera solution.

the metastatic process.14–16 the involvement of selectins in metastasis could be confirmed in several animal
experiments by the finding of reduced metastasis using
selectin antibodies or selectin-deficient animals, respectively.14–17 in wild-type animals unfractionated heparin
(ufh) also exhibited antimetastatic activity. however,
in selectin-knockout mice, it did not further reduce
metastasis formation.16–19 therefore, p- and l-selectin
appear to be the main molecular targets for heparin
effects.
given that there are considerable structural differences between ufh and lmwh, and also between
the various lmwhs, the question arises whether they
also differ in their antimetastatic activity. two recent
studies focused on a comparison of the inhibitory
capacity of different heparins in experimental metastasis
in mice.20,21 in both studies the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux that corresponds to the antithrombinbinding site of heparin did not show an antimetastatic
effect, nor did it bind to  xxxg2049xxx . given that the
synthetic heparin derivative fondaparinux did not show
any antimetastatic effect, an independence of antimetastatic effects from the anticoagulant activities was
pointed out. furthermore, deviations in the activities
of heparins were reflected in functional assays on the
inhibition of tumor cell binding. the different capacities
were related to structural inhomogeneities and size
fractionation.
selectins are unique receptors with respect to
their rapid bond formation. these peculiarities of the
binding kinetics are also supposed to apply to selectin–
heparin interactions because both heparins and the
physiological ligands are glucans. the aim of this study
was to examine whether heparins with different selectinantagonizing capacities also display derivations in the
binding kinetics to p- and l-selectin. for this purpose,
we selected two lmwhs (enoxaparin and  xxxd2690xxx )
and the ufh liquemin n (hoffman-la-roche ag,
grenzach-wyhlen, germany) that showed differences
in antimetastatic activity in a recent study.21
the quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) biosensor is a mass-sensitive transducer that is based on the
piezoelectric properties of quartz crystals. an electrical
excitation induces an oscillation of the quartz sensors.
given that the resonance frequency of these oscillations
correlates with the mass load on its surface,22 changes in
mass can be detected in real time by monitoring of the
frequency shifts.
we provide the first direct measurement of
affinity and kinetics of fractionated heparins to both
p- and l-selectin compared with ufh. the results
confirm the impact of selectin-antagonizing action on
antimetastatic activity insofar as the ufh with the
highest activity displayed the strongest binding. the
different antimetastatic activities of the two lmwhs
did correlate with their functional inhibition of

qcm measurements

qcm measurements were performed with a liquilab21 quartz crystal microbalance (ifak e.v., barleben,
germany). measurement chambers consist of polycarbonate and have a chamber volume of 100 ml. a
peristaltic pump ensured the transport of the substance
solutions to the quartz crystal surface under constant
flow conditions. quartz crystals with 10 mhz resonance frequency (14 mm diameter) were supplied by
ifak e.v. the coated quartz crystals were inserted into
the measurement chambers. pbs buffer with ca2 þ
(1 mm) and mg2 þ (1 mm) was used for the flow.
the experiments were performed under a flow rate
of 270 mlmin–1. this flow rate corresponds roughly
to a shear rate of 5 second–1. the quartz crystals
were equilibrated under flow for 30 minutes leading
to a constant resonance frequency. the indicated
concentrations of ufh or lmwhs were added
under constant flow conditions. the change of frequency was monitored in real time using the appropriate software.
calculation of the kinetic data

the kinetic data were calculated from the monitored
frequency curves. the calculation required a first-order
kinetic of the binding of the different heparins to l- and
 xxxg2049xxx . this was controlled by analyzing different
concentrations of the compounds. a 1:1 binding of the
compounds to the selectins was obtained in a low molar
range. in this range of different concentrations the
monitored frequency curves led to identical kinetic
data. the lowest concentration of this range was selected
for the experiments.
the association rate (on-rate, kon) was calculated
from the descending part of the curve according to
equation 1. df is the measured frequency change at
the time t, [a] is the concentration of the injected
heparin. fmax is the maximum frequency change of the
completely loaded quartz crystal. t0 is the time when the
decrease of the frequency begins.

results and discussion
application of the biosensor system for pand l-selectin binding kinetics
the mass sensitivity of a qcm biosensor is based on the
correlation between the mass loaded on the sensor surface, induced by biological binding processes, and the
changes in the resonance frequency of the sensor. to
obtain specific binding and recognition processes, the
biofunctionalization of the sensor surface is an essential
prerequisite. therefore, we immobilized  xxxg2049xxx –
fc-chimera or l-selectin–fc-chimera chemically on
the surface. according to validation experiments, 4 mg
of each selectin was considered optimal with respect to
the selectin amount/binding ratio. the accessibility of
immobilized selectins was confirmed using selectin antibodies, which displayed strong and significant binding
compared with nonspecific igg (data not shown).
the binding of compounds from the flow medium onto the selectin-functionalized quartz surface can
be observed in real time following the frequency shifts, as
illustrated in fig. 1.
after the resonance frequency was equilibrated
under flow of pure medium, medium containing the test
compound was injected into the system. binding of the
compound led to a decrease in frequency to a minimum

after the maximum change of frequency is
achieved, rinsing with pbs leads to a frequency increase.
this increase permits the calculation of the dissociation
rate (off-rate, koff), according to equation 2, where f0 is
the frequency value at t0. t0 is the point in time when the
increase of frequency begins. f is the frequency value at
the point in time t.

that represents the equilibrium of binding. replacement
of the compound solution by pure medium led to the
dissociation of bound compounds. the dissociation is
reflected in a certain frequency increase and the course of
frequency changes allows the calculation of the kinetic
binding constants according to equations 1 to 3.

binding kinetics of ufh to p- and l-selectin
liquemin n was shown to possess a significant pselectin–antagonizing capacity in our previous in vitro
studies on the inhibition of cell rolling.23 no experimental data exist for this ufh with respect to
l-selectin binding. other ufhs have been described
to generally bind to l-selectin. although different ufh
preparations may vary in their structural composition
and in their biological activities,24 binding of liquemin
n to l-selectin could be anticipated.
to apply the established qcm system for the
detection of binding kinetics of liquemin n to p- and
l-selectin, we first evaluated the optimal heparin concentration. in the clinical application as antithrombotics,
ufh is dosed in international units (iu), reflecting
their respective in vitro anticoagulant activity. although
it was shown that the anticoagulant activity is not
correlated with other biological activities, such as selectin inhibition, heparin was either used on mass basis or
according to international units for several selectin
studies.16,18,20,23–25 qcm is a mass-sensitive technique
and therefore exact gravimetric comparisons should be
maintained. however, detection of binding kinetic has
the obvious advantage of being independent of concentrations, as long as a 1:1 binding stoichiometry according
to the langmuir absorption model is assured. we
analyzed the kinetic binding behavior of different concentrations ranging from 1.28  10 6 m (17 mg/ml) to
1.28  10 5 m
(170 mg/ml) considering the
indicated average mw for calculating the molar concentrations. all ufh concentrations within this range
displayed similar koff values. higher amounts than 67
mg/ml tended to lower the kon. the lower kon values
indicate that not all of the heparin molecules bind to the
immobilized selectins adequately. in this case, equation
1 cannot be applied properly to calculate kon.
therefore, we used a concentration of
2.56  10 6 m (33 mg/ml) liquemin n for the
p- and l-selectin binding experiments. the obtained
kinetic binding data are summarized in table 1.

the kd values of 6.07  10  7 m and
1.06  10 7 m, respectively, illustrate that liquemin n
binds with high affinity to both p- and l-selectin. these
data confirm numerous approaches to use heparin as a
selectin inhibitor in inflammation and tumor metastasis.26,27 the affinity of liquemin n to l-selectin is even
higher than that to  xxxg2049xxx , and results from both a
faster association (on-rate) and a slower dissociation (offrate). considering the differences in binding kinetics of
p- and l-selectin toward their respective physiological
ligands, one could not have anticipated these findings.28,29 however, the  xxxg2049xxx  affinity of liquemin
n is consistent with the data recently presented by wang
et al,30 the only published data of heparin–selectin binding kinetics. the authors analyzed the interaction of
soluble  xxxg2049xxx  with bsa-conjugated heparin, immobilized on the chip sensor surface of a surface plasmon
resonance. the off-rate of 3.15  10 3second–1 described by wang et al is close to our findings. the 10-fold
higher on-rate might be explained by differences in the
experimental setup (i.e., the immobilization of heparin as
described by wang et al30 versus the use of immobilized
selectin in our approach). the resulting affinity of
1.15  10 7 m is lower than our findings (6.07  10 7
m) due to the differences in the on-rate.
nevertheless, both the data of wang et al30 and
our data demonstrate that ufh binds with strong
affinity in the high nanomolar range to both p- and
l-selectin. the potential as selectin inhibitor results
from the much slower off-rate compared with the
physiological ligands.

p- and l-selectin binding kinetics of two
different lmwhs
each of the clinically applied lmwhs is produced by its
own procedure. this leads to certain differences in their
respective structural composition that may have implications for their activity profile.31 various lmwhs
have been investigated in several selectin-related experiments, but data on binding affinity that would allow a
real comparison between the selectin binding potencies
of ufh and the class of lmwhs and between those of
different lmwhs do not exist. we selected enoxaparin
and  xxxd2690xxx  for our binding studies. in a recent study,
enoxaparin was found to be less active than  xxxd3379xxx 
and  xxxd1805xxx  in binding l-selectin. in binding pselectin, it was less active than  xxxd3379xxx  as well, but

as active as  xxxd1805xxx .20 furthermore, enoxaparin was
reported to be inferior to  xxxd2690xxx  in both binding pselectin and reducing the experimental lung metastasis of
melanoma cells in mice.21
to apply the qcm technique for the lmwh
detection, we first optimized the concentration of the
compound needed for the binding detection. a concentration of 100 mg/ml was considered optimal. this
appears sensible with respect to the mw and to the
used concentration of liquemin n. the binding kinetic
data of both lmwhs to p- and l-selectin are summarized in table 2.
it is evident that both lmwhs display nearly
identical binding characteristics. as already detected for
liquemin n, the lmwhs bind slightly better to
l-selectin than to  xxxg2049xxx . the affinity increase is
driven mainly by a slower off-rate from l-selectin than
from  xxxg2049xxx . the general binding affinity of both
lmwhs is lower compared with ufh. the reason is
expressed markedly in the approximately 5-fold slower
on-rates of the lmwhs. this might be explained by
the slightly lower charge density of lmwhs and/or
their lower chain length compared with ufh. both
factors result in a lower total number of negative charges
per molecule as potential contact points to  xxxg2049xxx .
moreover, this is in line with our previous finding that
charge density is the dominant factor for selectin binding.23 in summary, the data illustrate that the two
lmwhs used in this study represent equally active
potent p- and l-selectin inhibitors, and that slight
binding differences compared with ufh can be
explained by structural parameters.

conclusions
this study provides for the first time kinetic binding
constants and affinity data of two lmwhs and one
ufh to both p- and l-selectin. the data confirm that
all three heparins represent potent inhibitors that are
active in a low micromolar or high nanomolar range,
respectively. the similar p- and l-selectin binding
characteristics of each of the heparins demonstrate that
the two receptors have identical structural requirements
to those of their inhibitors. the data emphasize the

importance of considering the binding kinetics, given
that the slightly increased affinity of ufh compared
with lmwh can be explained clearly by a higher
association tendency toward the receptors. the higher
binding affinity of ufh versus lmwh is reflected in
various cell binding assays, and lmwhs with higher
mw and charge density, such as  xxxd3379xxx , were shown
to increase the selectin binding ability.20 the two recent
studies comparing the antimetastatic activities of different heparins found that ufh slightly exceeded the
effects of the selected lmwhs.20,21 our data confirm
these findings and emphasize the role of selectin inhibition for reducing cancer cell metastasis. however, the
intrinsic binding ability of different lmwhs in vitro
does not necessarily correlate with the antimetastatic
activity. the in vivo effects obviously are influenced by
several additional factors, such as pharmacodynamics or
biodistribution, which might result from structural differences other than mw and charge density between
them. this could explain why we found absolute identical affinities of  xxxd2690xxx  and enoxaparin to p- and
l-selectin, although both products displayed differences
in the recent antimetastatic experiments.21
to conclude, several heparins represent very potent inhibitors of both p- and l-selectin. this characteristic is influenced strongly by structural parameters and
results clearly from beneficial binding kinetics, such as
much slower off-rates compared with the physiological
ligands. these findings emphasize the hypothesis that
the antimetastatic activity of heparins is based dominantly on inhibition of p- and l-selectin. however, the
selectin binding kinetics cannot be correlated directly
with antimetastatic activity in all cases. obviously, structural differences between distinct heparin preparations
may have no influence on a single pharmacodynamic
effect, but may have implications for the overall in vivo
effects as the result of a very complex process.
