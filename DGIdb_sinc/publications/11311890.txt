beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation selectively inhibits il-12p40 release in microglia.  the cytokine  xxxg1164xxx  (il-12) is mainly produced in response to bacterial or parasitic infections. we examined the capacity of mouse brain microglia to release il-12 forms upon challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and studied its modulation by sympathomimetics. lps evoked the release of il-12p40 whereas the heterodimeric form, il-12p70 was virtually undetectable. sympathomimetics such as salbutamol dose-dependently inhibited il-12p40 release, whereas the production of il-6,  xxxg2296xxx  and mip-1alpha was only marginally influenced. the inhibitory effect of salbutamol could be abolished by beta-antagonists, such as  xxxd2812xxx . the camp-elevating agent  xxxd1742xxx  could mimic the effects of beta-agonists, indicating that il-12p40 release inhibition involves intracellular camp accumulation. while microglial il-12p40 may play a role in the regulation of il-12p70 bioactivity, microglial release is itself modulated by il-12p70. recombinant il-12p70 was found to enhance the lps-evoked release of mip-1alpha and to have a biphasic effect on both  xxxg2296xxx  and mip-1alpha with release augmentation at lower and attenuation at higher doses. finally, no functional correlation was found between the release of il-12p40 and the induction of  xxxg1232xxx  potassium channels, another marker of microglial activation. taken together, beta(2)-adrenoreceptor-mediated effects on microglial cyto- and chemokine release via camp accumulation could modulate inflammatory cascades during bacterial infections.
