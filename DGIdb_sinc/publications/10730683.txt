orlistat, a weight-loss agent with a novel mechanism of action, recently was
approved by the food and drug administration for the treatment of obesity.
it inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the gastrointestinal
tract to decrease systemic absorption of dietary fat. in several trials lasting up
to 2 years, orlistat was more effective than diet alone for weight reduction and
maintenance of lost weight. orlistat treatment also results in modest
improvements in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure,
and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. the major adverse effects are
gastrointestinal, usually occur early in therapy, and tend to decrease with
continued treatment. because orlistat may decrease the absorption of fatsoluble vitamins, a standard multiple-vitamin supplement is recommended
daily during therapy to prevent abnormalities in vitamin serum
concentrations. the potential for severe gastrointestinal discomfort and the
modest degree of weight loss may limit the agent’s clinical utility. its longterm safety and effectiveness for weight maintenance, cost-effectiveness of
treatment, and overall reduction in obesity-related morbidity and mortality
remain to be determined.

summary and conclusion

obesity is a chronic condition that affects
approximately one-third of the united states
population. 1, 2 its prevalence has increased
dramatically over the past 2 decades, and it has
been identified as the second most common
factor contributing to preventable death in the
country.2, 3 obesity is a primary risk factor for
the development of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and other cardiovascular
disorders.4, 5 it also plays a role in the development
of gallbladder disease, degenerative joint disease,
respiratory disorders, and certain types of
cancers.4, 5 as a result, the economic burden of
the condition is substantial. in 1995 the total
economic cost of obesity-associated disease in the

orlistat for management of obesity heck et al
united states was estimated to be $99.2 billion.6
clinical guidelines for identifying, evaluating,
and treating overweight and obese adults were
developed by a panel of experts convened by the
national institutes of health. 7 according to
these guidelines, diet therapy, increased physical
activity, and behavioral modification remain the
mainstays of treatment. however, it was
recognized that pharmacologic agents approved
for long-term therapy may be useful adjuncts to
diet and exercise for patients with a body mass
index (bmi) of 30 kg/m2 or more, and for those
with a bmi above 27 kg/m2 who have concomitant
obesity-related risk factors or diseases.7 two
drugs, orlistat and sibutramine, are approved by
the food and drug administration (fda) for
long-term therapy of obesity.8 orlistat (xenical;
roche pharmaceuticals, nutley, nj), was granted
approval in march 1999 for obesity management,
including weight loss and weight maintenance.9
this agent has a novel gastrointestinal mechanism
of action and is the first available antiobesity
agent that does not primarily alter neurotransmitter
concentrations in the central nervous system.
chemistry
the structural formula of orlistat [(s)-2formylamino-4-methyl-pentanoic acid (s)-1[[(2s,3s)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]dodecyl ester] is shown in figure 1. the drug’s
chemical formula is c 29 h 53 no 5 . it is a
diastereomeric molecule with four chiral centers
and a molecular weight of 495.7.
clinical pharmacology
orlistat is a potent, specific, irreversible
inhibitor of pancreatic and gastric lipases. also
known as  xxxd2792xxx , it is a chemically
synthesized derivative of  xxxd2792xxx , which is
naturally produced by streptomyces toxytricini.10,
11
it exerts its pharmacologic activity by forming
a covalent bond with the active serine site of

gastric and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the
gastrointestinal tract. this action prevents these
enzymes from hydrolyzing dietary fat (in the
form of triglycerides) into absorbable free fatty
acids and monoglycerols. 11–13 undigested
triglycerides are eliminated by the fecal route.
lipase inhibition induced by orlistat decreases
systemic absorption of dietary fat, thereby
contributing to caloric deficit. the agent does
not appear to inhibit the activity of other
pancreatic enzymes, such as  xxxg1759xxx ,
amylase, or trypsin.10
data from pharmacokinetic studies using
radiolabeled orlistat in both non-obese and obese
individuals indicate that the drug is not appreciably absorbed into the systemic circulation.9, 14,
15
after single oral doses of 14c-orlistat 50 or 360
mg, maximum plasma concentrations of total
radioactivity occurred within approximately 8
hours.14, 15 at the time of peak total radioactivity,
plasma concentrations of orlistat were below the
detectable assay limit of 5 ng/ml. 9, 14, 15 in
multiple-dose studies, using a more sensitive
assay with a lower limit of detection equal to
0.20 ng/ml, detection of orlistat in human plasma
was infrequent, with low measurable concentrations ranging from 0.20–8.8 ng/ml.16, 17 there
was also no evidence of drug accumulation in
patients treated with a dosage of 120 mg 3
times/day for up to 2 years.17 thus all of orlistat’s
pharmacologic actions are believed to be exerted
in the gastrointestinal tract.
metabolism of the agent appears to occur in
the gastrointestinal wall.9 based on data from
studies of radiolabeled orlistat in obese patients,
two major metabolites were identified, m1, with
a hydrolyzed 4-member lactone ring, and m3, m1
with the n-formal leucine moiety cleaved. 15
these metabolites accounted for approximately
42% of total radioactivity in plasma, with mean
concentrations of 26 ng/ml and 108 ng/ml for m1
and m3, respectively, 2–4 hours after drug
administration. the primary metabolite, m1, has
a relatively short half-life of approximately 3
hours; the half-life of m3 is approximately13
hours.9, 15 both m1 and m3 contain an open blactone ring in their chemical structures. due to
their very low plasma concentrations, and given
data indicating that the b-lactone ring is required
for lipase inhibition, they are considered to be
pharmacologically inactive.9, 15, 17
orlistat is excreted almost completely by the
fecal route.15 after an oral dose of 14c-orlistat
360 mg in normal-weight and obese subjects,
approximately 97% of drug was recovered in

272

pharmacotherapy volume 20, number 3, 2000

feces, with 83% as unchanged drug.15 less than
2% was recovered in urine, and complete
excretion of total radioactivity occurred 3–5 days
after administration.15
clinical efficacy
short-term trials
several short-term trials evaluating the efficacy
of the drug for promoting weight loss in obese
adults showed it to be safe and more effective
than diet alone.18–24 these trials ranged in length
from 6 weeks to 6 months, and all patients who
received orlistat also were instructed to follow a
hypocaloric diet with less than 30% of calories
derived from fat. as expected, the most common
adverse effects associated with orlistat were
gastrointestinal. results of short-term studies are
shown in table 1.19–21, 23, 25
long-term trials
analysis of pooled data from five studies
involving over 3000 subjects showed that
orlistat-treated patients lost approximately 9% of
body weight after 1 year of treatment, compared
with 5.8% in placebo-treated patients. total
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)
were significantly reduced, and diastolic blood
pressure and fasting insulin and glucose
concentrations decreased in orlistat-treated
patients. 25 the agent’s effects on lipoprotein
concentrations appeared to be greater than
expected for the degree of weight loss.
two large, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trials administered the drug for
up to 2 years. both studies, one conducted in the
united states and the other in europe, were
similar in design. the former compared orlistat
with placebo for weight loss and weight
maintenance in 892 obese patients (average
weight 100 kg, average bmi 36 kg/m2) who were
otherwise healthy.26 during a 4-week, singleblind, placebo lead-in period the subjects were
instructed to consume an approximately 500kcal/day caloric-deficit diet that provided 30% of
total daily calories in the form of fat. patients
with compliance of at least 70% (determined by
capsule counts) were stratified according to
initial weight loss (< 2 kg, ≥ 2 kg); 668 were
randomized to receive orlistat 120 mg and 224 to
receive placebo 3 times/day with meals for 1 year.
the hypocaloric diet was continued throughout
the first year of the study. at the end of the year,
orlistat-treated patients who achieved 70%

compliance were re-randomized to receive
orlistat 60 mg, orlistat 120 mg, or placebo 3
times/day for an additional year; placebo-treated
patients continued to receive placebo. in an
effort to stabilize body weight, the dietary intake
of all subjects was modified from a hypocaloric
diet to a weight-maintenance diet for the second
year. all patients were required to attend dietary
counseling and behavior modification sessions 4
times/year. the primary end point was change in
body weight. secondary end points included
serum concentrations of total cholesterol, ldl,
high-density lipoprotein (hdl), triglycerides,
fasting glucose, and insulin, as well as decreases
in standing waist circumference and blood
pressure. fat-soluble vitamin serum concentrations and prothrombin time (to assess vitamin
k status) also were evaluated.
during the 4-week placebo lead-in, patients
lost approximately 2.3 kg and had 8% decreases
in total cholesterol and ldl. at the end of 1
year, 59% (133) of patients in the placebo group
and 69% (458) of orlistat-treated patients
remained in the study. reasons for withdrawal
were similar between groups. orlistat-treated
patients lost an average of 8.8 kg, which was
statistically greater than the mean 5.8-kg loss in
the placebo group (p<0.001). in addition, 65.5%
and 38.9% of orlistat-treated patients experienced
greater than 5% and greater than 10% reductions
in baseline (before placebo lead-in) body weight,
respectively, whereas only 43.6% and 24.8% of
the placebo group achieved these degrees of
weight loss.
by the end of 2 years, patients in both groups
had regained some weight, but those who
received orlistat 120 mg regained significantly
less (35.2% regain) than those who received 60
mg (51.3%) or placebo (63.4%). thirty-four
percent of patients treated with the higher dosage
of orlistat for 2 years maintained a weight loss of
greater than 10% from baseline, compared with
17% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.02).
compared with total cholesterol measured at the
end of the 4-week placebo lead-in, values
increased in all groups at the end of the second
year. however, patients who received orlistat 120
mg had significantly smaller increases in total
cholesterol than those who received placebo (191
mg/dl increased to 195 mg/dl vs 193 mg/dl
increased to 201 mg/dl, p<0.001). similarly, after
the placebo lead-in, fasting serum glucose
concentrations did not increase as much in
subjects taking orlistat 120 mg as in the placebo
group (101 mg/dl increased to 102 mg/dl vs 101

essentially unchanged. mean waist circumference decreased significantly in the orlistattreated group (placebo 2.38 cm, orlistat 4.52 cm,
p<0.05).26
the total number of adverse events was similar
between groups; however, the orlistat group
reported gastrointestinal events more frequently.
for example, 79% of these patients, compared
with 59% of those who received placebo,
reported at least one gastrointestinal adverse
event. these were flatus with discharge (40.1%),
oily spotting (32.7%), fecal urgency (29.7%),
fatty or oily stool (19.8%), oily evacuation
(14.3%), fecal incontinence (11.8%), and
increased defecation (11.1%). these events were
reported to be of mild to moderate intensity and
decreased during the second year of treatment.
vitamin supplementation was provided for
patients in whom serum vitamin concentrations
fell below the standard reference range, which
included 14.1% of patients receiving orlistat 120
mg and 6.5% of those receiving placebo.26
subjects in the second study included 688
patients (average bmi 36 kg/m2, average weight
99 kg) seen at obesity treatment centers
throughout europe.27 after completing a 4-week
placebo lead-in phase and receiving instructions
to follow a hypocaloric diet, 345 patients were
randomized to receive orlistat 120 mg and 343
placebo for 1 year. patients from both groups
were re-randomized at the end of the first year
either to continue the same regimen or to receive
the alternative treatment for an additional year.
diet was modified for weight maintenance during
the second year.
weight loss after 1 year of treatment with
orlistat was slightly greater than that in the
former study. these patients lost an average of
10.3 kg compared with 6.1 kg in the placebo
group (p<0.001). nine percent of orlistat-treated
patients, compared with 2% in the placebo group,
lost more than 20% of their initial body weight,
and 29.5% lost between 10% and 20% compared
with 15.6% in the placebo group. at the end of
the trial, 57% of patients who received orlistat for
2 consecutive years maintained a weight loss of
greater than 5% from baseline (before placebo
lead-in). weight regain for orlistat-treated
patients who were switched to placebo during
the second year was significantly greater than
that for patients who continued active treatment
(mean difference 2.4 kg, p<0.001). as was
observed in the united states trial, both groups
experienced significant decreases in total
cholesterol and ldl during the placebo lead-in.

patients who received placebo for 2 consecutive
years had gradual increases in total cholesterol
and ldl toward baseline concentrations, and
those who received orlistat maintained significant
reductions at the end of year 2. mean total
cholesterol concentrations in the orlistat-treated
group were 223 mg/dl at baseline, 208 mg/dl at
the time of randomization, and 205.3 mg/dl at
the end of year 2; respective mean ldl values
were 147.7, 137.3, and 133.8 mg/dl. there were
no significant changes in hdl levels. blood
pressure was reduced significantly in the orlistat
group compared with the placebo group after 2
years, but the effect size was small. mean
diastolic and systolic blood pressures for the
orlistat treatment groups were 133 and 85 mm
hg at baseline, compared with 132 and 85 mm
hg in the placebo group, 129 and 83 mm hg at
the time of randomization, compared with 128
and 85 mm hg in the placebo group, and 127
and 80 mm hg at the end of the trial, compared
with 129 and 82 mm hg in the placebo group.
overall withdrawal rates were larger in the
placebo group (83 patients) than in the orlistat
group (61 patients). however, withdrawals due
to gastrointestinal adverse events were more
common with orlistat-treated patients (3.5% vs
0.6%). in general, adverse effects and vitamin
replacement requirements were similar to those
reported in the united states trial.
results of these two clinical trials provide
evidence that orlistat is more effective than
placebo in promoting and maintaining weight
loss. however, several factors should be
considered when formulating clinical decisions
based on these data. the drug’s effects on body
weight may be different in general clinical
practice than in research trials. patients enrolled
in the trials were exposed to extensive and
continuous dietary counseling and behavioral
modification. such resources are believed to
have a substantial impact on overall weight loss
but may not be readily available or consistently
applied in most clinical settings. subjects in
these trials were selected for their adherence to
therapy during a 4-week lead-in period.
selection for adherence again was applied after 1
year of treatment, when subjects were rerandomized. thus, the weight losses reported in
the studies represent an ideal, and actual weight
loss might be considerably smaller when orlistat
is taken in the absence of organized behavioral
modification and without subject selection. total
weight loss was reported from the beginning of
the 4-week placebo lead-in period. the best

orlistat for management of obesity heck et al
adherence to dietary restrictions, and thus the
most rapid weight loss, generally occurs in the
first month of therapy. therefore, weight
reductions that can be attributed to orlistat alone
may be smaller than reported in these studies.
however, it should be noted that the change from
a hypocaloric to a maintenance diet may have
contributed to weight regain during the second
year of these studies.
orlistat may not benefit all patients. weight
loss in these studies was highly variable. in both
studies weight loss was reported as means ±
standard error of the mean (sem), thereby giving
the appearance of minimal variability. conversion
of data to means ± standard deviation (sd) more
clearly indicates the extent of weight lost. for
example, when sem is converted to sd, the
range of weight loss at the end of year 1 changed
from 8.76 ± 0.37 kg to 8.76 ± 9.48 kg in the
united states trial.26 this suggests that some
patients responded more favorably to orlistat
than others. characteristics of patients who may
be more likely to respond have not been
identified. although gastrointestinal adverse
effects in both studies were mild or moderate in
severity, some patients may be unwilling to
tolerate them, as they are more common and
more severe early in treatment, before substantial
weight has been lost. in the united states study,
the 1-year dropout rate due to adverse effects in
patients receiving orlistat was 9.1% compared
with only 4.0% in the placebo group.26
the results of these trials may be confounded
by possible unblinding of treatment groups due
to the gastrointestinal effects associated with
orlistat. in the united states trial, 4.9% of
patients in the placebo group dropped out during
the first year due to “treatment failure,” whereas
only 0.9% of orlistat-treated patients withdrew
for this reason.
the drug’s long-term health benefits are
unclear, as are benefits accrued from modest
reductions in weight. after 2 years of continuous
therapy, patients lost an average of 4.5% of initial
body weight (~ 4 kg).26 although modest weight
reductions (5–10%) were reported to improve
obesity-related risk factors, 28 the effect on
mortality remains to be determined.
type 2 diabetes
the agent’s effect on weight loss and glycemic
control in 322 patients with type 2 diabetes was
evaluated in a 57-week, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial. 29 patients

275

(average bmi 34 kg/m2, body weight 99 kg) with
an average hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) of 8.1%, who
were stabilized with either  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd2204xxx ,
underwent a 5-week placebo lead-in period with
a hypocaloric diet, after which 163 were
randomized to receive orlistat 120 mg and 159
were randomized to receive placebo 3 times/day
for 57 weeks. the primary outcome measure was
body weight; secondary outcome measures were
glycemic control, lipid concentrations, and waist
circumference.
at the end of the 5-week placebo lead-in, both
groups experienced a weight reduction of
approximately 2 kg and a decrease in fasting
glucose concentrations of 17–20 mg/dl. after 57
weeks of treatment, patients who received orlistat
had substantially more weight loss from baseline
(6.19 vs 4.31 kg, p<0.001), with 48.8% losing 5%
or more of baseline weight, compared with 22.6%
for those receiving placebo (p<0.001). fasting
blood glucose remained relatively constant at the
end of 57 weeks (0.36 mg/dl decrease) in the
orlistat group, whereas patients in the placebo
group had a mean increase of 9.7 mg/dl
(p<0.001). orlistat-treated patients with baseline
blood glucose concentrations greater than 140
mg/dl experienced the greatest benefit (mean
decrease 8.4 mg/dl). they also had significantly
greater reductions in hba 1c concentrations
(mean decrease 0.28% vs 0.18%, p<0.001), with
patients having baseline hba1c concentrations
above 8% showing the greatest benefit (mean
decrease 0.53%). the average dosages of
 xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2204xxx  also decreased by 23% in
orlistat-treated patients compared with 9% in the
placebo group (p=0.0019).29
adverse effects, withdrawal rates, and vitamin
supplementation requirements were similar to
those reported previously.26, 27, 29 orlistat was
effective in reducing weight and improving
glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
weight loss is often more difficult for diabetic
patients to achieve because several pharmacologic treatments (sulfonylureas, insulin) may
result in increased weight. 30 therefore, as
expected, the weight loss achieved with orlistat
in these patients was not as large as that in
otherwise healthy obese patients.26, 27, 29 it may be
argued that the improvement in glycemic control
was merely a result of weight loss. however, the
placebo group experienced an average weight
loss of 4 kg at the end of the 57 weeks, and this
was accompanied by increases in both fasting
blood glucose and hba1c concentrations. this
suggests that orlistat may have an added effect

276

pharmacotherapy volume 20, number 3, 2000

above that of diet alone in improving glycemic
control. a long-term trial to assess its role in
preventing the development of type 2 diabetes in
obese patients is under way.
weight maintenance
the utility of orlistat for weight maintenance
after conventional dieting was examined in a 1year study of obese subjects who were able to
lose 8% or more of their initial body weight with
a 6-month hypocaloric diet. 31 during the 6month weight-reduction period, 1313 otherwise
healthy obese subjects (bmi 28–43 kg/m2) were
instructed to consume a hypocaloric diet (based
on individually calculated basal metabolic rates
to achieve an energy deficit of 1480 kj/day) and
received extensive dietary counseling, behavioral
modification therapy, and encouragement to
increase physical activity. of the 729 subjects
who reached the predetermined weight loss goal,
181 were randomized to receive orlistat 120 mg,
173 to receive orlistat 60 mg, 187 to receive
orlistat 30 mg, and 188 to receive placebo 3
times/day with meals for a year. metabolic
requirements were assessed for all patients, and a
maintenance diet designed to prevent further
weight loss and minimize weight regain was
developed for the remainder of the study. dietary
counseling and behavioral modification were
continued.
the average amount of weight loss during the
6-month diet phase was 10 kg among all groups.
during the ensuing year, all groups experienced
weight regain. subjects who received orlistat 120
mg regained the least amount (32.5%), which
was statistically significant compared with
placebo (56% regain, p<0.001). those who
received orlistat 30 mg had an average regain of
53.3% from the time of randomization, and the
60-mg group regained 47.2%, consistent with a
positive dose-response relationship. total
cholesterol and ldl remained 5–7% lower than
baseline in all subjects treated with orlistat but
increased in those receiving placebo. the group
taking orlistat 120 mg recorded the greatest
decreases in total cholesterol (8%) and ldl (7%)
after 52 weeks. there were no significant
differences among groups in hdl, blood
pressure, or waist circumference. the safety and
tolerability profile of orlistat was similar to that
reported in previous trials.26, 27, 29, 31
results of this study suggest that orlistat 120
mg 3 times/day minimizes weight regain after
conventional diet therapy. as with previous

studies, these results may have been affected by
the change to a maintenance diet. more
favorable results may have been obtained if a
hypocaloric diet were continued for longer than
6 months. the large number of patients (584)
who were unable to achieve the desired weightreduction goal with diet alone emphasizes the
need for additional obesity-management options.
drug interactions
as many overweight or obese patients may be
taking concomitant drugs for obesity-related
comorbidities, it is important to consider the
potential for drug interactions with orlistat.
given that orlistat is minimally absorbed,
however, the potential for clinically significant
systemic interactions appears to be low. several
crossover studies conducted in small numbers of
normal healthy volunteers showed that orlistat
does not markedly affect the pharmacokinetics of
oral contraceptives, warfarin, phenytoin, digoxin,
 xxxd2215xxx , atenolol, furosemide, nifedipine,
 xxxd2722xxx  tablets, captopril, or
ethanol. 32–40 however, it did enhance the
bioavailability and pharmacologic effect of
pravastatin.9 the extent and clinical significance
of this interaction remains to be determined, and
the potential for drug interactions due to the
pharmacologic actions of orlistat in the
gastrointestinal tract requires further study.
although not well studied, the effect of dieting
and dietary modification on the disposition of
certain agents should be considered.
adverse effects
gastrointestinal
safety data were collected from more than 5000
patients who were treated with orlistat during
clinical trials. 9 major adverse effects are
gastrointestinal and are related to the agent’s
pharmacologic effect as a lipase inhibitor. the
most common complaints are abdominal
discomfort, liquid stools, soft stools, oily rectal
spotting, flatulence and flatus with discharge,
fecal urgency, fatty or oily stools, increased
defecation, and fecal incontinence.9, 26, 27, 29, 31 at
least one of these symptoms occurred in up to
95% of orlistat-treated patients during clinical
trials.26, 27, 29, 31, 40 however, most were mild to
moderate and did not persist for more than 4
weeks; they usually occurred within the first
week of therapy and decreased with continued
treatment.9, 40

orlistat for management of obesity heck et al
because the drug is expected to decrease the
amount of free  xxxd2154xxx  present in the
gastrointestinal lumen by approximately 30%,
theoretically it may impair gallbladder motility
and predispose patients to stone formation. in
one single-dose study in adults, it did not affect
gallbladder motility.41 however, the long-term
effects on motility and possible sludge or
gallstone formation are unknown. safety
concerns also have been raised about the
potential for the development of colon cancer,
osteoporosis, renal oxalate stones, and vitamin
deficiency associated with long-term orlistatinduced steatorrhea.42–44 postmarketing studies
are necessary to evaluate the potential for these
serious long-term adverse effects.
fat-soluble vitamin absorption
orlistat inhibits pancreatic carboxylester
lipase, the enzyme necessary for hydrolysis of
vitamin esters and absorption of fat-soluble
vitamins.9, 12, 13 during clinical trials, it decreased
fat-soluble vitamin absorption.9, 26, 27, 29, 31 the
effect is most notable with vitamins d and e and
b-carotene.9, 40 neither absorption of  xxxd3105xxx 
nor steady-state serum concentrations of retinol
appear to be significantly affected after long-term
treatment.45 in addition, although vitamin k1
concentrations were not monitored during
clinical trials, no significant alterations in
prothrombin times were observed in orlistattreated subjects. 26, 27, 29, 31 the drug, however,
does decrease the absorption of  xxxd3521xxx  and
steady-state  xxxd3521xxx  plasma concentrations
significantly. 9, 40, 45 during clinical trials atocopherol concentrations decreased in orlistattreated patients; however, plasma concentrations
did not often fall below the standard reference
range, and low values were corrected with
 xxxd3521xxx  supplementation.26, 27, 29, 31
vitamin d concentrations have decreased with
long-term orlistat treatment. after 2 years of
therapy, subjects had an 8% decrease in 25hydroxy-d concentrations. calcium and
 xxxg1885xxx  concentrations were
unchanged. as with  xxxd3521xxx , 25-hydroxy-d
concentrations remained within the normal
reference range when vitamin d was
supplemented. 9, 40 orlistat also decreases
absorption of b-carotene by approximately
30%. 46 in clinical trials, this decrease was
ameliorated by multivitamin supplementation.26,
27
thus, a daily standard multiple-vitamin
supplement is recommended during orlistat

277

therapy to prevent abnormalities in vitamin
serum concentrations.9
breast cancer risk
in pooled data from all clinical trials evaluating
orlistat, 12 cases of breast cancer were found in
orlistat-treated women, compared with 2 cases in
those who received placebo.40, 47 most tumors
were identified within 6 months of starting
treatment and were sufficiently large at the time
of detection that orlistat was an unlikely cause.
however, because of fda concerns that the drug,
in some way, might stimulate the growth of
preexisting neoplasms, an extensive retrospective
analysis was conducted in an effort to interpret
these findings. evaluation of histologic tumor
data from each case by an independent expert
revealed significant heterogeneity among
samples, as well as evidence of cancer in situ and
lymph node metastases, suggesting that the
development of cancerous cells predated treatment with orlistat. in more recent, prospective
studies, one breast neoplasm was diagnosed in an
orlistat-treated woman and six in placebo-treated
women.48 based on this information, and in view
of the drug’s minimal systemic absorption, it was
concluded that these finding were most likely the
result of chance.40, 47
dosage and administration
orlistat is approved for obesity management,
both weight loss and weight maintenance, in
patients with an initial bmi 30 kg/m2 or greater
and for those with bmi 27 kg/m2 or greater who
have other weight-related risk factors. 9 the
lowest, maximum-effect dosage is 120 mg 3
times/day, which inhibits approximately onethird of ingested dietary fat. therefore, the
recommended dosage is 120 mg 3 times/day
during or up to 1 hour after each fat-containing
meal. if a meal does not contain fat or if the
patient skips a meal, the dose may be omitted.9
the agent should be taken with a low-calorie diet
containing less than 30% of calories from fat.
patients should be cautioned that taking it with a
high-fat diet may result in increased
gastrointestinal adverse effects. patients also
should be instructed to take a multiple vitamin at
least 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking
orlistat.9 because systemic absorption of orlistat
is negligible, no dosage adjustments are
necessary for patients with impaired end-organ
function. the drug is not approved for children
or adolescents under age 16 years, and no studies

278

pharmacotherapy volume 20, number 3, 2000

of its benefits or risks in the pediatric population
have been reported. orlistat is available as 120mg capsules, and the average wholesale price for
90 capsules is $118.80.49
summary and conclusion
orlistat is the first antiobesity agent to be
approved in the united states that exerts its full
pharmacologic effects in the gastrointestinal tract
and does not primarily alter central nervous
system neurotransmitters. by inhibiting gastric
and pancreatic lipases in the lumen of the
gastrointestinal tract, it can prevent absorption of
nearly one-third of dietary fat. when combined
with diet and behavior modification, it results in
significantly more weight loss than placebo and
induces modest improvements in lipid profile,
glucose control, and blood pressure. orlistat may
influence dietary choices because consumption of
high-fat meals with the drug can lead to more
severe gastrointestinal adverse effects. whereas it
appears to have a favorable safety profile,
additional studies are necessary to evaluate its
long-term safety and potential for interactions
with other agents. available data suggest that, in
selected patients, orlistat may be an effective
adjunct to diet and exercise for the management
of obesity. although its modest weight reduction
may benefit obese patients, its efficacy for weight
maintenance and effect on obesity-related morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.
lacking data with respect to long-term clinical
outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and impact on
quality of life, coupled with the necessity to take
the drug 3 times/day and potentially bothersome
adverse effects, may limit its clinical utility.
orlistat should be used as monotherapy for
obesity, as no trials have reported its safety and
efficacy in combination with anorexiant drugs.
