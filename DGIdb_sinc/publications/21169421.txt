abstract
vitamin d compounds regulate pth at the transcriptional level, presumably via binding to the  xxxg2412xxx  (vdr),
but the exact mechanism is presently unclear. we recently reported that the several vitamin d prohormones with low
vdr affinity suppressed pth, even when their activation was inhibited, raising the possibility that their actions may be
vdr independent. to test this hypothesis, we developed a novel organ culture that allowed the assessment of activities
of the prohormones on pth release from wild-type and vdr-null thyroparathyroid explants. the cultures remained
viable with respect to pth release for at least 2 weeks. full suppression of pth by the native vitamin d hormone,
 xxxd408xxx  [1a,25 (oh)2d3], required 2 days, consistent with a transcriptional mechanism, and was
reversible, indicating that reduced pth was not attributable to cell death. inhibition of pth release by 1a,25 (oh)2d3 and
two prohormones, 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 and 1a-hydroxyvitamin d2, was observed in explants from wild-type mice but not
in those from vdr-null mice. these findings 1) are the first direct demonstration of the role of the vdr in regulation of
pth by 1a,25(oh)2d3, 2) confirm that the suppressive actions of the vitamin d prohormones are mediated by the vdr,
and 3) introduce a novel organ culture model that allows the ex vivo study of the function of parathyroid glands from
transgenic animals.

introduction
the parathyroid glands play a central role in calcium
homeostasis. a drop in serum calcium triggers the
release of pth, which enhances renal calcium
reabsorption and bone calcium mobilization. pth
also stimulates the renal synthesis and release of
 xxxd408xxx  [1a,25(oh)2d3], which
increases intestinal calcium absorption. restoration of
calcium levels reduces pth release by inhibiting
exocytosis, promoting pth peptide degradation, and
destabilizing pth mrna. pth is also suppressed via a
feedback loop in which 1a,25(oh)2d3 blocks pth gene
transcription.
the mechanism for transrepression of the pth gene
by 1a,25(oh)2d3 remains controversial. at least three
distinct mechanisms have been proposed, but none
have been tested directly in parathyroid cells. the first
model proposes that 1a,25(oh)2d3-bound vitamin d
receptor (vdr) binds to a negative vitamin d response
element (vdre) in the human pth promoter,
although the binding partner, if present, is not retinoid
x receptor as is often seen with positive vdres (mackey
et al. 1996). the second model proposes a more classical
mechanism involving liganded vdr and rxr binding
to a dr3-type element (two direct repeats of consensus

3-base elements separated by a 3-base spacer); this
element is found in the rat and chick pth promoters
and was shown to act as a negative element in some, but
not all, cell types, but has not been tested in parathyroid
cells (koszewski et al. 1999). more recently, a third
model was proposed in which liganded vdr binds to
and inactivates a positive effector (vitamin d interacting
receptor or vdir) of pth gene transcription, with no
binding of the vdr to dna (murayama et al. 2004).
furthermore, although all of the mechanisms assume
that the repression by 1a,25(oh)2d3 is mediated by the
vdr, this has not been demonstrated directly in
parathyroid cells with the native gene.
we recently reported direct suppression of pth by
several vitamin d prohormones (or prodrugs) which
lack key hydroxyl groups necessary for high affinity
vdr binding (brown et al. 2006, ritter et al. 2006). the
prodrugs 25(oh)d3 (calcidiol) and 1a(oh)d2 ( xxxd1935xxx ) retained full suppressive activity when their
‘activation’ by hydroxylases was blocked with cytochrome
p450 inhibitors. the basis for the retention of pth
suppression is not clear, but several possibilities may be
entertained. the prodrugs may accumulate in parathyroid cells to higher levels than 1a,25(oh)2d3, which could
overcome their lower vdr affinities. it is also possible that
the protocols for measuring vdr affinities in vitro may

not reflect the vdr affinities in the cells. at present,
we cannot exclude the involvement of a unique receptor
that mediates the direct actions of the prodrugs on pth
gene transcription. the existence of multiple receptors
for vitamin d compounds was suggested by the studies
of panda et al. (2004), who found that the very high
levels of 1a,25(oh)2d3 in vdr knockout mice suppressed
parathyroid growth; the receptor involved has not
been identified.
in the present study, we test the hypothesis that the
direct suppression of pth by 1a(oh)d 2 and
25(oh)d3 is independent of the vdr. in vivo studies
would not be informative since the prohormones would
be activated. therefore, we established a novel organ
culture model utilizing thyroparathyroid explants from
wild-type and vdr-null mice to determine the role of the
receptor in the inhibition of pth gene expression by
1a(oh)d2 and 25(oh)d3.

a vdrk/c breeding pair (b6.129s4-vdrtm1mbd/j) was
purchased from jackson laboratory (bar harbor, me,

of 500 and 382 bp for the mutant and wild-type alleles,
respectively. to prevent parathyroid hyperplasia,
vdrk/k mice were maintained on a diet containing

which was collected after 24 h for a baseline pth level.
tptgs were then treated with vehicle (0.1% ethanol)
or 100 nm 1a,25(oh)2d3, 25(oh)d3, or 1a(oh)d2,
and daily collections of medium were continued. in
initial studies, 1a,25(oh)2d3 was removed after 2 days
of treatment to determine the reversibility of the
suppression.

results
characterization of cultured mouse tptgs

organ culture of mouse tptgs has not been reported
previously. therefore, we established the stability of the
system with respect to pth secretion. pth secretion
was maintained over a 2-week period, and the rate of
pth release consistently increased slightly during the
cultures. as shown in fig. 1, a 2-day treatment with
1a,25(oh)2d3 reduced pth secretion by over 90%.
the slow rate of suppression is consistent with a
transcriptional repression and relatively long half-life
of pth mrna (ritter et al. 2008). note that the
reduction in pth continued for 24 h after washout of
the 1a,25(oh)2d3. pth release returned to basal levels
over several days, confirming that the reduction in pth
was not attributable to cell death. these findings
illustrate the utility of the tptg organ model to study
parathyroid gland function.

discussion
transcriptional control of pth expression by
1a,25(oh)2d3 has been demonstrated in cell culture
(russell et al. 1986, russell & sherwood 1987) and
in vivo (silver et al. 1986), but the exact mechanism
remains controversial (mackey et al. 1996, koszewski
et al. 1999, murayama et al. 2004). none of the
transcriptional mechanisms have been confirmed in
parathyroid cells, and direct involvement of the vdr
has not been demonstrated. in the current study, we

parathyroid gland function ex vivo. for the first time, we
provide proof of the requirement of the vdr for
repression of pth by 1a,25(oh)2d3.
previous studies from our group found that vitamin d
prohormones can directly suppress pth in bovine
parathyroid cell culture. 1a(oh)d2, which has 600
times lower affinity for the vdr than 1a,25(oh)2d3
(okamura & zhu 1997), was shown to suppress pth
secretion and pth mrna in bovine parathyroid
cultures, even when activation to 1a,25(oh)2d2 or
1a,24(oh)2d2 was blocked by the cytochrome p450
inhibitor ketoconazole (brown et al. 2006). similarly,
25(oh)d3, which also has 600 times lower affinity than
1a,25(oh)2d3 for the vdr (norman et al. 2001),
suppressed pth in cultured bovine parathyroid cells
when its activation to 1a,25(oh)2d3 was inhibited by
 xxxd1732xxx  (ritter et al. 2006). the explanation for
these surprising findings was unclear, but one possibility was that the control of pth expression by
25(oh)d3 and 1a(oh)d2 is mediated by another
receptor. this hypothesis was tested using cultured
tptgs from vdr knockout and wild-type mice. the
results revealed unequivocally that regulation of pth
by these two ‘precursors’ requires the vdr.
the mechanism for the direct effect of the two
prohormones remains to be elucidated. it is possible
that the equilibrium binding method used to measure
vdr affinity may not accurately reflect the dynamic
situation within the cell. for example, 25(oh)d3 and
1a(oh)d2 may dissociate from the vdr during the
separation of bound and free ligand in the assay, causing
an underestimation of the interaction that would occur
in vivo or in cell culture where the concentrations of
the compounds would be constant. another possibility is
that the two compounds, which are more hydrophobic
than 1a,25(oh)2d3, may be sequestered at high enough
concentrations within the cells to overcome the weaker
vdr affinity. this hypothesis is consistent with preliminary findings that cellular uptake of 1a(oh)d2 is
much higher than that of 1a,24(oh)2d2 (cs ritter &
aj brown 2006, unpublished data). the explanation for
the higher cellular and nuclear content of 1a(oh)d2 is
unclear, but the intracellular vitamin d-binding proteins,
 xxxg1102xxx  (adams et al. 2004) and  xxxg242xxx  (chun et al. 2007),
have been shown to play a role in cellular distribution
of vitamin d compounds and may enhance the activities
of the prohormones relative to 1a,25(oh)2d3. other
explanations, such as differential recruitment of transcriptional co-regulators, cannot be excluded.
as illustrated by the current study, thyroparathyroid
organ culture from transgenic mice provides a useful
model for studying the effects of genetic modifications
on parathyroid gland function ex vivo. in vivo
approaches are limited in their interpretation because
disruptions that affect pth will be subject to feedback
by calcium and vitamin d, making it difficult to identify

primary and secondary effects. our findings demonstrate that pth release is stable over several days and is
regulated by vitamin d compounds. the potential
utility of this model to study parathyroid hyperplasia is
under investigation.
