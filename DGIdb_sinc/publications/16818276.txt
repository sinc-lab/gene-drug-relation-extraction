expression of human  xxxg2131xxx  (hent1) and its correlation with gemcitabine uptake and cytotoxicity in mantle cell lymp...  nucleoside transporters might play a relevant role in the intracellular targeting of many nucleoside analogs used in anticancer therapy. two gene families (slc28 and slc29) encode the two types of human nucleoside transporters, concentrative nucleoside transporter (cnt) and equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ent) proteins. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) cells express both slc28- and slc29-related mrna, although transport function seems to be mostly related to ent-type transporters. here we have analyzed the role of nucleoside transporters in nucleoside-derived drug bioavailability and action in mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) cells.
