abstract
recently, tissue segment binding method with a hydrophilic radioligand [3h]-cgp12177 was developed to detect plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors
in rat heart (horinouchi et al., 2006). in the present study, propranolol (40 mg kg− 1 day− 1), atenolol (40 mg kg− 1 day− 1) and  xxxd329xxx  (200 mg
kg− 1 day− 1) were administered to rats for 6 weeks, and the changes of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors and their mrna expression in rat ventricle
were examined. chronic administration of propranolol increased the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors but decreased the  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors without changing total
amount of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors. atenolol increased both plasma membrane  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors, whereas  xxxd329xxx  had no
effect on the beta-adrenoceptor density and their subtype proportions. in contrast, the density of beta-adrenoceptors detected in conventional homogenate
binding study was extremely low (approximately 60% of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors detected with the tissue segment binding method)
and the effects of chronic administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were not necessarily in accord with those at the plasma membrane
beta-adrenoceptors. the mrna levels of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors were not altered by propranolol treatment, while  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor mrna
significantly decreased after administration of atenolol or  xxxd329xxx  without changing the level of  xxxg92xxx  mrna. the present binding
study with intact tissue segments clearly shows that the plasma membrane  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors of rat heart, in contrast to the homogenate
binding sites and the mrna levels, are differently affected by chronic treatment with three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; up- and down-regulations of
 xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors, respectively, by propranolol, and up-regulation of both the subtypes by atenolol, but no significant change in both the
subtypes by  xxxd329xxx .

introduction
beta-adrenoceptors have important roles in cardiac function
and are one of therapeutic target molecules in cardiovascular
diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias and
angina. many beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have been clinically
used for the therapy of those diseases. however, since cardiac
beta-adrenoceptors change dynamically, the effects of beta-adreno-

ceptor antagonists have been thought not to be constant during
their chronic treatment (brodde and michel, 1999; madden
et al., 2006). up-regulation is defined as an increase in the
number of receptor and is one of the receptor-mediated adaptation well observed upon antagonist therapy (haeusler, 1990).
up-regulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors has been recognized
clinically as well as in experimental animal studies, but the
reports are conflicting. for example, chronic treatment with
propranolol increased the number of beta-adrenoceptors in rat
heart (glaubiger and lefkowitz, 1977), but such up-regulation
was not observed in several other studies (baker and potter,
1980; baker and katovich, 1982). thus, the changes of cardiac
beta-adrenoceptor in beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy remain
controversial, in spite of its clinical significance.

cardiac beta-adrenoceptors have been so far measured in
radioligand binding assays using homogenates or microsomal
fractions of heart muscle (tsuchihashi et al., 1989; sarsero
et al., 1998). however, the conventional homogenate binding
method may produce a change in receptor environment which
may cause receptor disintegration and/or deformation and a
significant loss of receptor yield (hiraizumi-hiraoka et al.,
2004; tanaka et al., 2004). in addition, surface and intracellular receptors cannot be separately identified after homogenization. in order to overcome these problems, we recently
developed the intact tissue segment binding method (muramatsu et al., 2005) and demonstrated in the rat hearts that
combination of this tissue segment binding method and a
hydrophilic radioligand, [3h]-cgp12177, enables a more precise quantitation of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors (horinouchi et al., 2006).
in the present study, we examined the effects on plasma
membrane beta-adrenoceptors of rat hearts of the chronic treatment with three different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists which
have been used clinically; propranolol ( xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx 
nonselective, reiter, 2004), atenolol ( xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor selective,
reiter, 2004) and  xxxd329xxx  ( xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoceptor selective,
frishman et al., 1988).
methods
animals
male wistar rats weighing 250–300 g (charles river japan,
inc., yokohama, japan) were used in the present study. animals
were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on 8:00 a.m.;
lights off 8:00 p.m.) and had free access to standard laboratory
food and tap water. the room temperature and relative air
humidity were regulated at 21–25 °c and 40–70%, respectively. the present study was performed according to the guidelines
for animal experiments, university of fukui (which is accredited by the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and
technology, japan).
drug treatment
the drug treatment was essentially the same as that described
previously (takita et al., 1993; 1995). briefly, propranolol,
atenolol, and  xxxd329xxx  were dissolved with tap water, and
given ad lib. the daily consumption of propranolol, atenolol
and  xxxd329xxx  was estimated to be 40, 40 and 200 mg kg− 1
day− 1, respectively, based on a mean intake of 35 ml day− 1 of
water for a 250-g rat. the systemic effects of these drugs and
doses were described previously (takita et al., 1993; 1995). in
preliminary studies, the treatment period of beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists was changed from 1 to 3 or 6 weeks and the effects
were examined. however, since any changes in the binding
parameters for beta-adrenoceptors were not observed after 1- and
3-week treatments, the administration period of 6 weeks was
chosen in the present study. one day after withdrawal of the
treatment, the rats were sacrificed and were used in binding and
mrna experiments.

tissue isolation
the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg kg− 1) and killed by cervical
dislocation. the heart was rapidly excised and atria, cardiac
valves, great vessels and fat were carefully removed. isolated
ventricle was placed in a modified krebs–henseleit solution of
the following composition (in mm): nacl, 120.7; kcl, 5.9;
mgcl2·6h2o, 1.2; cacl2·2h2o, 2.0; nah2po4·2h2o, 1.2;
nahco3, 25.5 and d-(+)-glucose, 11.5. the modified krebs–
henseleit solution was oxygenated continuously with a mixture
of 95% o2 and 5% co2 and maintained at 4 °c (ph = 7.4).
tissue segment binding experiments
tissue segment binding experiments were carried out
according to the method as described previously (horinouchi
et al., 2006). briefly, isolated ventricle was cut into small pieces
under a stereoscopic microscope. usually, 30 or more pieces
were prepared from one rat. the remaining ventricle was used
for homogenate binding studies. each piece was incubated at
4 °c in 1 ml of krebs' incubation buffer with [3h]-cgp12177
for 24 h. the composition of krebs' incubation buffer was
essentially the same as a modified krebs–henseleit solution,
except the nahco3 concentration was reduced to 10.5 mm to
adjust ph to 7.4 in air. the osmolarity of krebs' incubation
buffer was adjusted by adding nacl.
in saturation binding experiments, 50–2000 pm [ 3 h]cgp12177 was used in the absence or presence of 1 mum
(±)-propranolol to define nonspecific binding. to determine the
relative fraction of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors, competition binding experiments were conducted by using a single concentration
of [3h]-cgp12177 (200 pm), with a selective  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor
antagonist, ici-89,406 in 12 concentrations ranging from 10 pm
to 3 mum. after incubation, the pieces of tissue were gently
blotted and rinsed during vortexing for 1 min with 2 ml incubation buffer at 4 °c. the pieces were then blotted and solubilized in 0.3 m naoh solution to estimate the radioactivity and
protein content. experiments were done in duplicate at each
concentration of radioligand for a binding-saturation experiment, or at each concentration of competing ligand for bindingcompetition experiments. radioactivity was counted in a liquid
scintillation counter (lc-3500; aloka co. ltd., tokyo, japan)
using a water-miscible scintillation fluid (ultima gold™,
packard bioscience, groningen, netherlands). the protein
content in each tube was measured (bradford, 1976), and the
specific binding was determined by subtracting the radioactivity
bound per mg protein in the presence of 1 mum (±)-propranolol
from total radioactivity bound for mg protein.
crude homogenate binding experiments
crude homogenate binding experiment was carried out as
described previously (horinouchi et al., 2006). the rat ventricle
was minced with scissors and homogenized in 30 volumes (w/v)
of ice-cold tris/mg2+ assay buffer (composition in mm: tris–
hcl, 50; egta, 5; edta, 1; mgcl2, 4;  xxxd228xxx , 1 and

phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.5; ph 7.4) containing protease
inhibitors (complete™, edta-free tablet, roche diagnostics,
penzberg, germany), using polytron homogenizer. the homogenate was directly used for homogenate binding experiments.
the homogenates were incubated with [3h]-cgp12177 in
the absence or presence of ici-89,406 in a final volume of 1 ml
incubation buffer for 120 min at 37 °c. nonspecific binding
of [3h]-cgp12177 was determined with 1 mum (±)-propranolol.
assay was terminated by rapid filtration over whatman gf/c
filters presoaked with 0.3% polyethylenimine using a brandel
cell harvester, and filters were rapidly washed with 3 × 5 ml
aliquots of ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4).
the resulting filters were dried and the radioactivity retained
on filter paper was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
maximum binding capacity was represented in the same way as
tissue segment assay, where the protein content in the homogenates was measured as total tissue protein.

san diego, calif., u.s.a.). equilibrium dissociation constants
(kd) and binding site maximum (bmax) were derived from the
fitted saturation curves. competition binding data with ici89,406 were fitted well by a two-site model, and the proportions
of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors as well as ic50 values (concentrations producing 50% displacement of specific [3h]-cgp12177
binding) were calculated. the density of beta-adrenoceptors in rat
ventricle was represented as binding capacity per milligram of
total protein for each (bmax: femtomoles per milligram of total
protein).
data are presented as means ± s.e.m. and n refers to the
number of experiments. the significance of the difference
between mean values was evaluated with graphpad prism™
(version 3.00) by student's unpaired t-test. statistical significance was accepted at the p b 0.05 level.

measurement of beta-adrenoceptor mrna

the following drugs were used in the present study:
 xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride (nippon chemiphar co., ltd., tokyo,
japan); ici-89,406, (±)-propranolol hydrochloride (nacalai
tesque, kyoto, japan); atenolol, l- xxxd228xxx , phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (sigma-aldrich co., st. louis, mo., u.s.a.);
[3h]-(−)-cgp12177 (specific activity: 48.0 ci/mmol) (amersham biosciences, amersham place little chalfont, buckinghamshire, u.k.). all other chemicals used were of analytical
grade. the stock solution (10 mm) of ici-89,406 was prepared
in 99.5% ethanol, and then diluted with a modified krebs–
henseleit solution or binding buffer.

total rna was isolated from rat ventricles with or without
treatment of propranolol, atenolol, and  xxxd329xxx  using an
rneasy fibrous tissue mini kit (qiagen k.k., tokyo, japan)
according to the protocol. the isolated rna was reverse transcribed using the superscript™ preamplification system (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and the resultant first-strand cdna
was used for quantitative pcr. primers were designed and synthesized according to the published sequences of cdna encoding
rat  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx , and  xxxg53xxx  as an internal control.
the sequences of pcr primer pairs used were as follows:

the quantitative pcr was performed using a sybr green
pcr master mix kit (applied biosystems, foster city, u.s.a.)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. the thermal cycle
protocol used was as follows: 95 °c for 10 min, 45 cycles of
pcr (94 °c for 30 s, 60 °c for 15 s and 72 °c for 60 s, for beta1adrenoceptor and  xxxg53xxx ; 94 °c for 30 s, 50 °c for 30 s and
72 °c for 60 s, for  xxxg92xxx ) using a programmable
thermal cycler (prism7700, applied biosystems). the pcr
products were confirmed by a single band on electrophoresis
and of the single melting temperature. the  xxxg53xxx  gene was
used as an internal control for normalization of the data.
expression level of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx  mrnas was
represented as a ratio to  xxxg53xxx .
data analysis
saturation and competition binding data were analyzed by
non-linear regression using commercially available software

tissue segment binding experiments
to detect plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle
selectively, the tissue segment binding experiments with a
hydrophilic radioligand [3h]-cgp12177 were first carried out.
the binding-saturation isotherm revealed a single population of
plasma membrane binding sites with a high affinity, which was
not changed by chronic administration of propranolol, atenolol
and  xxxd329xxx  (table 1). this means that the binding affinity
for [3h]-cgp12177 of plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors was
not affected by the chronic treatment with the antagonists for
6 weeks, further suggesting that the residual drugs which might
be contaminated in the isolated tissues did not significantly affect
the binding assay. however, the density of [3h]-cgp12177
binding sites (bmax) was increased by 34% in atenolol-administered rat ventricle, although no significant difference in the
bmax values was seen in propranolol- or  xxxd329xxx -treated rats.
the proportions of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors were determined
in the competition experiments with ici-89,406 (a selective
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist). ici-89,406 showed 1600 times
higher affinity for plasma membrane  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors than
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors in rat ventricular segments (pki = 9.5 and 6.3,
respectively). these affinities for ici-89,406 were also not
affected by chronic administration of three antagonists (data
not shown). the proportions of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors were

rats were treated with propranolol (40 mg kg− 1 day− 1), atenolol (40 mg kg− 1
day− 1) or  xxxd329xxx  (200 mg kg− 1 day− 1) for 6 weeks. binding experiments with
tissue segments and homogenates were carried out in the ventricle isolated from
each rat. proportions of nonspecific binding were less than 45% and 25% at

respectively. n: number of experiments. pkd: negative logarithm of dissociation

56 and 44% in control rat ventricle, respectively. after chronic
treatment with propranolol, the proportion changed to 85% for
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor and to 15% for  xxxg92xxx , respectively.
chronic administration of atenolol caused no significant change
in the proportions of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors, thus the
absolute values of both subtypes increased in atenolol-treated
rats because the density of total beta-adrenoceptors was significantly increased (fig. 1a, table 1). chronic treatment with
 xxxd329xxx  had no significant effect on the proportions of beta1and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors.

homogenates did not change after chronic administration of
three tested antagonists (fig. 1b, table 1).
quantitative rt/pcr
since beta-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle were differently
changed after chronic administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists,  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx  mrnas were measured by
quantitative rt/pcr and the expression levels were normalized
against  xxxg53xxx , a house keeping gene. in general, the expression
level of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor mrna was approximately 340 times
higher than that of  xxxg92xxx  mrna in rat ventricle (fig.
2). chronic treatment with atenolol and  xxxd329xxx  produced
a significant decrease in the expression level of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor
mrna but propranolol caused no change in  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor
mrna level. the level of  xxxg92xxx  mrna was not
affected by the treatment with three tested antagonists (fig. 2).
discussion
recently we demonstrated that the plasma membrane
beta-adrenoceptors of rat ventricle can be identified by the
tissue segment binding assay with a hydrophilic radioligand
[3h]-cgp12177 (horinouchi et al., 2006). the present study
with the segment binding method clearly shows that the plasma

crude homogenate binding experiments
to detect total (surface and intracellular) beta-adrenoceptors, the
rat ventricle was homogenized and the conventional binding
experiments were carried out. as shown in table 1, pkd values
for [3h]-cgp12177 were not different either between the treatments of different drugs or between homogenate and tissue
segment assays, indicating that the residual drugs in the isolated
tissues did not significantly affect the [3h]-cgp12177 binding.
however, the density of beta-adrenoceptors in the homogenates
was significantly lower than the plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors detected in the tissue segments: for example, 23 ± 1 fmol/
mg protein of the homogenates and 39 ± 2 fmol/mg protein of
the tissue segments in control rats (p b 0.01). this means that
a significant loss was caused in beta-adrenoceptors detected
by homogenate binding assay. although the estimate in the
homogenates is considered to include both surface and intracellular receptors, it is uncertain which receptors are associated with the dramatic loss (horinouchi et al., 2006). under
such binding conditions, the maximal binding capacity of
beta-adrenoceptors was slightly increased in atenolol- and  xxxd329xxx -treated rats but not in propranolol-treated rats (table 1).
however, the proportions of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors in the

membrane beta-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle were differently
affected by chronic administration of three beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists. atenolol increased plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors, whereas no change in maximal binding capacity of
plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors was produced by propranolol or  xxxd329xxx  treatment. competition studies furthermore
revealed the occurrence of subtype-specific regulation for
plasma membrane  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors. especially, a drastic increase in  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor and the concomitant reduction
of  xxxg92xxx  were observed in propranolol-treated
rats, suggesting that the rat heart may become dominant
for  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor following chronic administration of propranolol. on the other hand, plasma membrane  xxxg836xxx - and beta2adrenoceptors both were significantly increased by atenolol
without altering their proportions, and no change in both the
subtypes was seen in  xxxd329xxx -treated rats. these different
changes in plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors after chronic
treatment with different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be
relevant to the different responses and efficacies observed in the
antagonist therapy (brodde and michel, 1999; bouzamondo
et al., 2001; madden et al., 2006).
the changes in plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors observed in tissue segment binding experiments are summarized in table 2, together with the results obtained in the

403

homogenate binding experiments and with mrna. since the
expression levels of  xxxg836xxx - and  xxxg92xxx  mrnas did
not change in parallel with the amounts of plasma membrane
beta-adrenoceptors, it is likely that various processes are involved
in the expression and maintenance of beta-adrenoceptors at the
plasma membrane and that the processes may be differently
affected by chronic treatment with three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. for example, chronic treatment with atenolol evoked an
increase in the protein level as mentioned above but decreased
the mrna level of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors. such discrepancy between
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor density and its mrna level was also reported in
a recent paper, where up-regulation of  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors was not
related to an increase in its mrna in the patients supported by
ventricular assist devises (milting et al., 2006). the stability and
fate of beta-adrenoceptors in vivo and the effects of chronic treatment with various antagonists should be clarified in more detail.
many receptors including beta-adrenoceptors are distributed in
not only surface but also intracellular sites (chalothorn et al.,
2002; dupre et al., 2006), and the receptors of both sites can
be detected by homogenate binding method. however, we
previously showed that homogenization causes a significant
loss of receptor yield in several native tissues, even though the
binding buffers were the same as or different from that used in
tissue segment binding assay (hiraizumi-hiraoka et al., 2004,
tanaka et al., 2004, muramatsu et al., 2005; morishima et al.,
2007). such a yield loss was confirmed in the present rat hearts;
total beta-adrenoceptors detected in homogenates were only 60%
of the plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors detected in intact
tissue segments. as described previously, homogenization and
fractionation did not produce the protein loss (horinouchi et al.,
2006). therefore, we consider that the difference in the maximal
binding capacity between tissue segments and homogenates is
due to a loss in receptors following homogenization, probably
caused by a structural modification resulting from the change
in receptor environment such as disruption of cytoskeleton or
dissociation from co-localizing proteins (hiraizumi-hiraoka
et al., 2004, tanaka et al., 2004, muramatsu et al., 2005;
morishima et al., 2007). thus, we must pay very careful attention to the results obtained by the conventional binding assay
with homogenates or microsomal fractions. this yield loss may
in part explain the conflicting results reported in beta-adrenoceptor
studies (glaubiger and lefkowitz, 1977; baker and potter,

even under such underestimated conditions, a small but significant increase in beta-adrenoceptors was detected in the homogenates of  xxxd329xxx - or atenolol-treated rats. this up-regulation
might reflect an increase in intracellular beta-adrenoceptors.
in summary, the tissue segment binding assay with a hydrophilic radioligand [3h]-cgp12177 clearly shows that plasma
membrane  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors in rat heart are up-regulated by
propranolol and atenolol but not  xxxd329xxx . the estimation of
plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors by tissue segment binding
assay may be useful for evaluation of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist
therapy.
