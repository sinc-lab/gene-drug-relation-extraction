abstract— xxxd3404xxx  is a loop diuretic that is effective at low once-daily doses in the treatment of arterial hypertension.
because its antihypertensive mechanism of action may not be based entirely on the elimination of salt and water from
the body, a vasodilator effect of this drug can be considered. in the present study, the ability of different concentrations
of  xxxd3404xxx  to modify  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii)–induced vascular responses was examined, with the use of an organ bath
system, in endothelium-denuded aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats. ang ii–induced increases of
intracellular free calcium concentration ([ca21]i) were also examined by image analysis in cultured vascular smooth
muscle cells (vsmcs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats. a dose-response curve to ang ii was plotted for
cumulative concentrations (from 1029 to 1026 mol/l) in endothelium-denuded aortic rings (pd257.560.3). isometric
contraction induced by a submaximal concentration of ang ii (1027 mol/l) was reduced in a dose-dependent way by
 xxxd3404xxx  (ic5050.560.04 mmol/l). incubation of vsmcs with different concentrations of ang ii (from 10210 to 1026
mol/l) resulted in a dose-dependent rise of [ca21]i (pd257.560.3). the stimulatory effect of [ca21]i induced by a
submaximal concentration of ang ii (1027 mol/l) was blocked by  xxxd3404xxx  (ic5050.560.3 nmol/l). our findings
suggest that  xxxd3404xxx  blocks the vasoconstrictor action of ang ii in vitro. this action can be related to the ability of
 xxxd3404xxx  to block the increase of [ca21]i induced by ang ii in vsmcs. it is proposed that these actions might be
involved in the antihypertensive effect of  xxxd3404xxx  observed in vivo. (hypertension. 1999;34:138-143.)

ecent long-term clinical studies have demonstrated the
beneficial effects of low-dose diuretics in reducing
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the treatment of
hypertension.1,2 therefore, diuretics continue to be recommended as first-line agents in the treatment of hypertension.3
it has been suggested that the long-term antihypertensive
effectiveness of diuretics is due to its ability to reduce
peripheral resistance through a direct arteriolar vasodilator
action.4 animal experiments have shown that diuretics reduce
the vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictor agonists like
norepinephrine and  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii).5,6 in addition, in
hypertensive patients it was shown that long-term use of
diuretics desensitizes the vasculature in its response to endogenous vasoconstrictor hormones.7
 xxxd3404xxx  is a pyridil sulfonil urea class compound
whose chemical structure places it between loop diuretics and
cl2 channel blockers.8 the main tubular site of action of
 xxxd3404xxx  is the ascending limb of the loop of henle, where
it interacts with the na1, 2cl2, k1 cotransporter localized in
the luminal surface.8,9 by this interaction, at high doses,

 xxxd3404xxx  inhibits nacl reabsorption which provokes diuresis.10  xxxd3404xxx  is used as a first-line therapy in hypertension,
and the results of several prospective therapeutic trials demonstrate that this compound reduces blood pressure at dosages that
do not result in documented natriuresis.11–13 therefore, the
antihypertensive mechanism of action of  xxxd3404xxx  may be
based not only on the elimination of salt and water from the
body, but also on an arterial vasodilator action. this possibility
is in agreement with previous in vivo and in vitro experiments
showing that loop diuretics, such as furosemide,14,15 and cl2
channel blockers, such as diphenylamine-2-carboxylate,16,17 exert vasorelaxation effects.
therefore, we hypothesized that  xxxd3404xxx  exerts a vasorelaxation effect by interfering with the vascular actions of
ang ii. to test this hypothesis we examined the in vitro
effects of  xxxd3404xxx  on both ang ii–induced isometric
contraction in aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive
rats (shr) and ang ii–induced intracellular free calcium
concentration ([ca21]i) transients in cultured vascular smooth
muscle cells (vsmc) from the aorta of shr.

methods
animals
the study was performed with 30-week-old male shr obtained from
rcc biotechnology & animal breeding (fullinsdorf, switzerland).
the rats were housed in cages maintained in a humidity- and
temperature-controlled room and fed a standard diet. they had
access to tap water ad libitum. the investigation was performed
according to the european community guidelines for animal ethical
care and use of laboratory animals (directive 86/609). before the rats
were euthanized by decapitation, the systolic blood pressure was
measured by the standard tail-cuff method. recorded systolic blood
pressure values were in agreement with those previously described in
this animal model at this age (21465 mm hg, mean6sem of
15 rats).18

preparation of isolated endothelium-denuded
aortic rings
the thoracic aorta was removed immediately after euthanization,
cleaned, and placed into krebs-heinseleit solution of the following
composition (mol/l): 118.4 nacl, 4.74 kcl, 1.18  xxxd2534xxx , oz7 h2o,
1.19 kh2po4, 2.52 cacl2z2h2o, 25 nahco3, 11.5 glucose. the
endothelium of the aorta was removed by gently rubbing the intimal
surface with the tip of a small steel probe. the aorta was cut into ring
segments (2 to 3 mm in length, 6 per rat) that were placed in a vessel
containing 10 ml of krebs-heinseleit solution oxygenated with a
95% o2, 5% co2 mixture and maintained at 37°c in a thermostated
bath (le 13206 thermostate, letica scientific instruments). two
stainless steel wires were inserted into the vascular lumen; 1 was
anchored to a stationary support, and the other was connected to a
force-displacement isometric transducer (tri 110, letica scientific).
changes in isometric forces were analyzed and recorded by an
isolated organs data acquisition program (proto5, letica scientific
instruments). the rings were incubated to equilibration at a resting
tension of 2g for 60 minutes, with buffer changes every 15 minutes
during this period. the lack of a functional endothelium was
confirmed by demonstrating the complete absence of relaxation
induced by acetylcholine (1025 mol/l) in norepinephrine (1027
mol/l)-precontracted aortic rings. the rings were then washed and
stretched, if necessary, until a stable baseline force was obtained.
after equilibration, each ring was exposed to 120 mmol/l kcl to test
the contractile response of the tissue.

study of vasoactive responses
cumulative concentration-response curves for the response to 1029
to 1026 mol/l ang ii were obtained in order to determine a
concentration of submaximal contraction and the pd2 value. in a
second group of experiments, the aortic rings were incubated for 30
minutes with different concentrations of  xxxd3404xxx , furosemide, and
irbesartan (10210, 1028, 1026 mol/l). after the incubation, a contraction induced by a submaximal concentration of ang ii was tested.
each preparation was exposed to only 1 concentration of the drugs
used and only to a single concentration of the agonist, to avoid
possible receptor desensitization. one aortic ring per rat was reserved to obtain control responses (100%) in the presence of the
solvent.

cell isolation and culture
primary vsmcs were obtained from the thoracic aorta of adult shr
and cultured by the tissue explants method in accordance with
previously published procedures.19 briefly, the smooth muscle tissue
was longitudinally opened and cut in small pieces that were grown in
plastic 6-well plates and maintained at 37°c in a humidified
incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% co2. tissue explants
were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium containing
20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic (10 000 u/ml
 xxxd2871xxx  sodium, 10 000 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 25
mg/ml  xxxd164xxx  as  xxxd164xxx  r in 0.85% saline). when
vsmcs began to emerge from the explants, they were subcultured
with 0.05% trypsin to a 25 cm2 flask. after the first subculture, cells

were subcultured every week and reached confluence in 5 to 6 days.
the medium was changed initially after 24 hours and then every 3 to
4 days. the culture was continued up to 8 passages with 5% fetal
bovine serum and antibiotic. immunocytochemical characterization
of isolated vsmcs was performed on primary cultures by use
of specific antibodies against smooth muscle specific a-actin
(dako ltd).

measurement of [ca21]i in vsmcs
measurement of [ca21]i was performed with nonconfluent cultures of
vsmcs grown on 12 mm round coverslips that were rendered
quiescent by deprivation of serum for 48 hours. afterward, each
coverslip was incubated in a humidified incubator for 45 minutes
with fura-2-am, 4 mmol/l dissolved in dmso with 0.02% pluronic
acid. unincorporated fura-2 was removed by giving each coverslip
two 15-minute washes in modified hanks’ buffer (mmol/l: 137
nacl, 4.2 nahco3, 3 na2hpo4, 5.4 kcl, 0.4 kh2po4, 1.3 cacl2, 0.5
mgcl2, 10 glucose, and 5 hepes, ph 7.4). coverslips with fura-2
loaded vsmcs were placed in a perfusion chamber with 200 ml of
modified hanks’ buffer in a thermostatically controlled stage heater
on top of the stage of an inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence with a 340 n.a. 1.3 oil immersion objective (diaphot,
nikon) and attached to an image analysis system (magiscal applied
imaging). excitation light for fluorescence was provided by a
100-watt xenon lamp, with double and alternating excitatory wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) and a single emission wavelength (510
nm). on binding ca21, fura-2 exhibits an absorption shift from 340
nm to 380 nm that can be monitored by measuring emission at
510 nm. the [ca21]i was calculated as previously described by
grynkiewicz et al.20

study of [ca21]i responses

the effects of various concentrations of ang ii (10210 to 1026 mol/l)
were examined in 4 to 6 experiments per concentration. after a 10
minute period to equilibrate the preparation, 40 ml of the appropriate
ang ii concentration was added to the buffer. basal and ang
ii–stimulated [ca21]i were measured in single cells. to avoid
possible desensitization, repetitive determinations were not made.
the effects of  xxxd3404xxx , furosemide, and irbesartan on ang
ii– evoked [ca21]i responses were also determined. for these experiments, the cells were preincubated for 10 minutes with each drug at
3 concentrations (10210, 1028, 1026 mol/l). then, ang ii was added,
and the [ca21]i transients were measured. to test their effects in
vitro, all drugs were weighed and dissolved in water or in dmso on
the day of the experiment.

statistical analysis
values are given as mean6sem. statistical differences between
mean values were determined with 1-way anova followed by
student-newman-keuls test. when the number of data was less than
10, the statistical analysis was performed with mann-whitney u test.
a p value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
concentration-response curves were fitted by nonlinear regression,
and a concentration giving 50% of the maximal response (ec50) was
determined and pd2 calculated as 2log ec50 (mol).

results
responses to ang ii in endothelium-denuded
aortic rings
ang ii evoked concentration-dependent increases in vascular
tone in aortic rings from shr (figure 1a). the calculated pd2
value was 7.560.3. on the basis of these concentrationresponse curves, a concentration of 1027 mol/l was chosen to
carry out the next experiments, because this concentration is
critically located on the curve. different levels of maximal
tension were obtained either by stepwise cumulative addition
of ang ii or by the addition of a single concentration of ang

responses during the cumulative concentration-response
curve in this tissue.

effects of  xxxd3404xxx  on ang ii–induced
responses in endothelium-denuded aortic rings
the ability of  xxxd3404xxx  to induce relaxation of norepinephrine-precontracted rings was tested. the percentage of relaxation (40%) induced by  xxxd3404xxx  in rings from shr was
observed only at a high concentration (1024 mol/l); it was
considered to be a nonspecific response and probably caused
by the solvent, as previously suggested by others.21
 xxxd3404xxx  inhibited, in a dose-dependent way, the vasoconstriction induced by ang ii (1027 mol/l) in aortic rings
from shr, ic5050.560.04 mmol/l (figure 1b). the inhibition of ang ii–induced contractile response almost reached
50% at 1026 mol/l  xxxd3404xxx  (table). as figure 2 shows, a
single concentration of ang ii (1027 mol/l) caused a prompt
and brief contraction of the aortic rings from shr with a
maximum value of 116.6610 mg (n522). this value was
reached 2 or 3 minutes after the beginning of incubation with
the agonist (figure 2a). a 30 minute period of incubation
with  xxxd3404xxx  (1026 mol/l) significantly inhibited the ang
ii–induced vasoconstriction (figure 2b).

figure 3a shows the concentration-response curves to ang ii
in vsmcs from adult shr. the basal [ca21]i was determined
in 139 cells (8366 nmol/l). these data are the average of all
cells studied in the presence of 1.3 mmol/l ca21 in the
bathing medium. ang ii increased the [ca21]i in vsmcs from
shr in a dose-dependent way (figure 3a). the calculated
pd2 value was 7.560.3. a concentration of 1027 mol/l of
ang ii was chosen to carry out the next experiments, because
it induced a submaximal effect (663669 nmol/l, n510).
both the resting [ca21]i values and the ang ii–induced
increase in [ca21]i obtained here are in agreement with those
reported for vsmcs from shr.19,22

effects of  xxxd3404xxx  on ang ii–induced [ca21]i
responses in vsmcs
 xxxd3404xxx  inhibited the ang ii–induced [ca21]i stimulation
in a dose-dependent way, ic5050.0460.01 nmol/l (figure
3b). the inhibitory effect was nearly 80% at 1026 mol/l
 xxxd3404xxx  (table) and was independent of the cell passage.
the variations of [ca21]i are shown as changes on a color
scale (figure 4). in basal conditions, cells are seen in blue.
upon stimulation with ang ii, a rapid rise in [ca21]i occurred
that reached its maximum in 10 seconds (yellow-red color),
declined rapidly within 30 to 40 seconds, and then gradually
decreased in the next 1 to 2 minutes to near resting values
(figure 5). vsmcs from shr incubated with 1026 mol/l of
 xxxd3404xxx  did not show the response of [ca21]i to ang ii
1027 mol/l (figure 4b).

effects of furosemide and irbesartan on ang
ii–induced vascular responses
furosemide and irbesartan inhibited, in a dose-dependent
way, the vasoconstriction induced by ang ii (1027 m) in
aortic rings from shr (table). whereas irbesartan inhibited
the ang ii–induced [ca21]i stimulation in a dose-dependent
way, furosemide did not exert any effect on this parameter
(table).

recording shows tension variation through time.

discussion
the main finding of the current study is that pharmacological
concentrations of  xxxd3404xxx  inhibit ang ii–induced fast
contraction in endothelium-denuded aortic rings from shr.
furthermore, we did observe that pharmacological concentrations of  xxxd3404xxx  block ang ii–induced rapid increase in
[ca21]i in cultured vsmcs of the aorta from shr.
central to the direct vasoconstrictor action of ang ii on
smooth muscle is its capacity to increase [ca21]i. following
the interaction with the ang ii type 1 receptor (at1), ang ii
mobilizes ca21 by releasing ca21 sequestered intracellularly
and by increasing ca21 influx from the extracellular compartment. the former event may occur by way of phosphoinositide turnover, and the latter may occur in association with
voltage-sensitive ca21 channels.23,24 as a consequence,
[ca21]i increases and contraction in vsmcs ensues. the
occurrence of this sequence of events is confirmed by our

results with the at1 antagonist irbesartan. because of its
physicochemical properties, it is unlikely that  xxxd3404xxx 
directly antagonizes the binding of ang ii to the at1 in
vsmcs.25 therefore, other mechanisms may be influenced
by the drug.
sodium and other ions influence ang ii binding and,
therefore, modulate hormone-receptor signaling.26 the na1,
2cl2, k1 cotransport system is but one of several means by
which na1 transport regulates ang ii–receptor interaction.
an na1/h1 antiporter, an na1/ca1 antiporter, and an na1
channel have also been described.27,28  xxxd3404xxx  might
inhibit the na1, 2cl2, k1 cotransport system in vsmcs as it
does in tubular cells.29,30 thus, the blockade of this cotransporter would reduce the cytosolic na1 activity, and this, in
turn, would interfere with ang ii–at1 signaling in vsmcs.
this is further supported by our observation that another
inhibitor of the cotransporter, furosemide, also interferes with
the vasoconstrictor activity of ang ii. interestingly, the
activity of the na1, 2cl2, k1 cotransport system has been
reported to be abnormally increased in vsmcs31 and erythrocytes32 from shr. furthermore, it has been found that
 xxxd3404xxx  derivatives, which inhibit the activity of the na1,
2cl2, k1 cotransport system, prevent the development of
hypertension in shr.33 whether the cotransporter abnormality is also present in vsmcs from hypertensive patients, as it
is in erythrocytes from them,34 and whether this can be

the digital imaging processor. the fluorescence changes were
clearly visualized by the camera. the 340/380 nm fura-2–associated fluorescence ratio on a pixel by pixel basis was calculated
and used as [ca21]i measure. the recordings were obtained

corrected by  xxxd3404xxx  and other loop diuretics in vivo
deserve further investigation.
unlike furosemide and other loop diuretics, the chemical
structure of  xxxd3404xxx  is similar to that of the cl2 channel
blockers. it has recently been described that ang ii stimulates
the opening of cl2 channels in vsmcs resulting in a cl2
efflux and consequent membrane depolarization.16 this process would drive the opening of voltage-gated ca21 channels,
ca21 influx, and vasoconstriction.35 it has been shown that
 xxxd3404xxx  inhibits cl2 conductance in epithelial cells.10
interestingly, sulfonic derivatives have been shown to block
cl2 channels in vsmcs from the rat aorta.36 our observation
that  xxxd3404xxx  inhibits ang ii–induced [ca21]i increase in
vsmcs more potently than does furosemide suggests that the

time course of ang ii–induced [ca21]i increase in the absence

*p,0.01 vs curve obtained in presence of  xxxd3404xxx .

blockade of cl2 channels may be an additional mechanism
involved in the ability of  xxxd3404xxx  to interfere with the
vasoactive actions of ang ii.
results presented here indicate that  xxxd3404xxx  alone is not
able to induce relaxation of precontracted endotheliumdenuded aortic rings from shr. because the endothelium
was removed in our preparation, this finding does not exclude
the possibility that  xxxd3404xxx  exerts a direct vasorelaxation
effect on the intact wall. this is supported by previous
experiments which show that  xxxd3404xxx  increased the content of cgmp in vsmcs of the aorta from renal hypertensive
rats.37 in addition,  xxxd3404xxx  has been shown to enhance
prostacyclin secretion in primary cultured human endothelial
cells.38
in summary, the results of the present study presented here
indicate that  xxxd3404xxx  inhibits ang ii–induced contraction
of aortic strips from shr. our findings also suggest that
 xxxd3404xxx  interferes with ang ii– dependent mechanisms
which lead to the stimulation of [ca21]i in vsmcs. further
experiments are necessary to make the roles of cl2 channels
and/or the na1, 2cl2, k1 cotransporter in these vascular
actions of  xxxd3404xxx  more precise. the in vitro data presented here may add further information to the in vivo antihypertensive effects of nonnatriuretic dosages of  xxxd3404xxx .
