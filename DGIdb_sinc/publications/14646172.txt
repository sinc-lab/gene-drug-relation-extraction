to find new prostanoid fp-receptor agonists possessing potent ocular-hypotensive effects with minimal side
effects, we evaluated the agonistic activities of newly synthesized prostaglandin f2a derivatives for the prostanoid
fp-receptor both in vitro and in vivo. the iris constrictions induced by the derivatives and their effects on
melanin content were examined using cat isolated iris sphincters and cultured b16 melanoma cells, respectively.
the effects of derivative ester forms on miosis and intraocular pressure (iop) were evaluated in cats and
cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. of these derivatives, 6 out of 12 compounds were more potent iris constrictors, with ec50 values of 0.6 to 9.4 nm, than a carboxylic acid of  xxxd2446xxx  (ec50513.6 nm). a carboxylic acid of
 xxxd2446xxx  (100 m m) significantly increased the melanin content of cultured b16 melanoma cells, but some 15,15difluoro derivatives, such as afp-157 and afp-172, did not. topically applied  xxxd3274xxx , afp-169 and afp-175
(isopropyl ester, methyl ester and ethyl ester forms, respectively, of afp-172) induced miosis in cats more potently than  xxxd2446xxx .  xxxd3274xxx  (0.0005%) reduced iop to the same extent as 0.005%  xxxd2446xxx  (for at least
8 h). these findings indicate that 15,15-difluoroprostaglandin f2a derivatives, especially  xxxd3274xxx , have more potent prostanoid fp-receptor agonistic activities than  xxxd2446xxx . hence,  xxxd3274xxx  may be worthy of further evaluation as an ocular-hypotensive agent.
key words fluoroprostaglandin f2a derivative; glaucoma; intraocular pressure; prostanoid fp agonistic activity

an elevated intraocular pressure (iop) is one of the risk
factors for the development of glaucoma. recent prospective
epidermal studies in the united states indicate that if iop is
lowered below 12 mmhg,1) or by more than 30% from the
baseline iop in patients with normal-tension glaucoma,2)
the progress of the visual field defect can be delayed.
prostaglandin (pg) derivatives exert ocular-hypotensive effects through stimulation of prostanoid receptors (fp, dp, ip
etc.) and possibly by activation of signal-transduction systems such as intracellular ca21 and  xxxd1773xxx .3—6) one of
the most potent  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives at reducing iop is
 xxxd2446xxx , a selective prostanoid fp-receptor agonist, and
this drug has been successfully developed as an anti-glaucoma agent.7) recently, another selective prostanoid fp-receptor agonist,  xxxd3414xxx , was launched in the united states
and other countries.8) because of their potent, long-lasting
ocular-hypotensive effects, prostanoid fp-receptor agonists
are widely used for the treatment of glaucoma.
however, clinical use over several years has revealed the
existence of patients who do not respond well to  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives.9,10) in addition, long-term application of  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives causes chronic adverse effects, such as iris/skin
pigmentation, eyelash growth, and so on.10—19) the  xxxd1902xxx  derivative-induced eye colour change is most likely due to
an increased amount of melanin within iris stroma
melanocytes.20—22) these adverse effects may be related to
the stimulation of prostanoid fp receptors in the eye.3)
to judge from the accumulating findings relating to
 xxxd2446xxx  and other  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives, prostanoid fp-receptor agonists are among the most promising ocular-hypotensive agents. to try to find prostanoid fp-receptor agonists that might be more potent at inducing an iop reduction
while causing fewer or weaker side effects than  xxxd2446xxx ,
we synthesized new  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives and evaluated their

materials and methods
materials prostarumon® f injection 1000 (1 mg/ml
 xxxd1902xxx  ) was obtained from ono pharmaceutical co., ltd.
(osaka, japan), while  xxxd1729xxx  was from cayman chemical co. (ann arbor, mi, u.s.a.).  xxxd2446xxx  free acid,
 xxxd2446xxx , and free acid and ester forms of various  xxxd1902xxx 
derivatives (table 1) were synthesized by asahi glass co.,
ltd. (tokyo, japan). the reagents used for cell culture were
obtained as follows: all tissue-culture media, antibiotics, supplements and trypsin-edta (life technologies, new york,
ny, u.s.a.); fetal bovine serum (sanko junyaku, tokyo,
japan); bicinchonianate (bca) protein-assay reagent®
(pierce, rockford, il, u.s.a.); synthetic melanin (sigma, st.
louis, mo, u.s.a.).
constriction of the isolated iris sphincter in cats a
functional prostanoid fp-receptor-affinity assay was performed using iris sphincter muscles isolated from cat eyes.23)
this tissue expresses predominantly prostanoid fp
receptors.24,25) male european cats (charles river japan,
kanagawa, japan) weighing from 2.5 to 5.0 kg were sacrificed by injection of intravenous sodium pentobarbital
(dainippon pharmaceutical co., ltd., osaka, japan). the
eyes were immediately enucleated and placed into modified
krebs–henseleit solution. the iris sphincter muscles were
prepared and cut in half, then suspended in modified
krebs–henseleit solution in a thermostatically controlled
(37 °c) 20 ml organ bath aerated with 95% o2 and 5% co2.

solution was 133 nacl, 16.1 nahco3, 4.7 kcl, 2.4 cacl2,
1.4 nah2po4, 1.0 mgcl2 and 7.8 glucose. a resting tension
of 100 mg was applied. after baseline tension had been established (following equilibration for at least 60 min), the
maximum constriction of the iris sphincter muscle was measured after dosing with  xxxd1902xxx  at 1 m m. then, the constrictions were measured after cumulative dosing with the various
 xxxd1902xxx  derivatives. force transducers (fd pickup, tb-612t,
nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) for the measurement of isometric constriction were connected to a polygraph for registration of the response. the  xxxd1902xxx  -derivative-induced constriction was expressed as a percentage of the 1 m m  xxxd1902xxx  induced constriction, which was taken as 100% constriction.
concentration-response data were subjected to regression
analysis to determine the concentration which shows 50%
constriction (ec50).

melanin content of cultured b16-f10 melanoma cells
melanin content was measured according to the method of
siegrist and eberle.26) murine b16-f10 melanoma cells
(teikyo university, kanagawa, japan) were maintained in
minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acid
solution, penicillin (50 u/ml, life technologies) and streptomycin (50 mg/ml, life technologies) at 37 °c in a humid atmosphere of 5% co2/95% air. the cells were seeded at a
density of 2.03103 cells/ml in 24-well culture plates containing the culture medium described above. after preincubation
of the cells under the above conditions for 24 h, a given
 xxxd1902xxx  derivative was added to the medium at various desired
concentrations. forty-eight hours later, the medium was
changed for an identical medium containing the same concentration of the same  xxxd1902xxx  derivative. then, all culture
plates were incubated for 48 h (total incubation time was
96 h). after the incubation, all culture plates were used for
assays of melanin content. duplicate 200 m l samples of culture medium were taken and placed into a 96-well immunoplate. after removal of the culture medium, cells were
washed twice with pbs(2), then sonicated in 0.1 n naoh
containing 10% triton x-100. duplicate 200 m l samples of
the cell lysate were placed into a 96-well immunoplate. the
absorbance of the culture medium and the cell lysate were
measured at 415 nm at the same time as those of a series of
doubling dilutions of a synthetic melanin standard. the
melanin contents of the culture medium and cell lysate were
calculated with the aid of an analytical curve for melanin
standard solution. the amount of proteins in the cell lysate
was measured, employing bca protein-assay reagent®.
changes in melanin content were calculated using the following equation and expressed as a percentage of the amount
of melanin in the absence of  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives.

pupillary diameter in cats topical application of
prostanoid fp-receptor agonists has been reported to produce
a dose-related miotic effect in the cat.27) the miotic effects of
the  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives were examined in male european cats
(charles river japan; weight, 3.0 to 3.5 kg) anaesthetized by
intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (sankyo,
tokyo, japan)  xxxd2274xxx .0—9.0 mg/kg.  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives were administered in 50 m l aliquots to one eye in each animal, with
vehicle (also 50 m l) being simultaneously administered to the
contralateral eye. then, the two eyes in each cat were photographed 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 24 h later. pupil diameter (pd)
was measured horizontally across the width of the pupil on
the photograph using an electrical pupillary ruler (mitutoyo

december 2003

co., kanagawa, japan). changes in pd in the  xxxd1902xxx  derivative-treated eyes were expressed as a percentage of the pd of
the contralateral vehicle-treated eye in order to normalize the
effects of systemic anaesthesia on pd.
intraocular pressure in conscious monkeys the iopreducing effects of  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives were examined in 6 ocular-normotensive cynomolgus monkeys (keary, osaka,
japan) weighing from 2.0 to 6.0 kg (3 to 8 years old, male).
the animals had been trained to accept restraint in monkey
chairs, instillation of eye drops and iop measurement using a
pneumatonometer (model 30-classic; solan, fl, u.s.a.)
before this experiment. a given  xxxd1902xxx  derivative was topically applied in one 20 m l aliquot to one eye, with vehicle
(20 m l) being administered to the contralateral eye. iop was
measured using a pneumatonometer under corneal anaesthesia with 0.4%  xxxd300xxx  hydrochloride (santen, osaka,
japan). iop measurements were performed 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h
after topical application of  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives and vehicle.
all cats and monkeys used were treated in accordance
with the arvo statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.
statistical analysis all data are presented as the
mean6standard error. statistical significance was assessed
using a student’s t-test or an analysis of variance (anova)
followed by dunnett’s multiple-comparison test. p,0.05 was
considered statistically significant in each form of analysis.
results
constriction in isolated cat iris sphincters the
 xxxd1902xxx  -derivatives-induced constrictions observed in isolated
cat iris sphincters are shown in table 2. a carboxylic acid of
 xxxd2446xxx  induced constriction with an ec50 value of
13.6 nm.  xxxd1729xxx  and several other  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives
were more powerful with ec50 values of 0.5 to 9.4 nm. the
introduction of fluorine atom(s) to the 15-position (afps120, 157, 159, 162, 164 and 172) preserved the constrictor
activity of  xxxd1729xxx . afp-159, which possesses a fluorine
atom at the 15-position, was less potent than afp-162, which
possesses two fluorine atoms at the same position. the introduction of a chloro group to the meta-position of the benzene
ring of afps-162 and 172 (yielding afp-157 and 164, respectively) reduced the prostanoid fp-receptor functional activities. the rank order of constrictor potencies for the various fluoro  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives was as follows: 15,15-difluoro16-phenoxy.15,15-difluoro-16-(3-chlorophenoxy)513,14dihydro 15,15-difluoro-16-phenoxy.15-fluoro-16-phenoxy5
carboxylic acid of  xxxd2446xxx . the introduction of chloro or
cf3 groups to the 19 and/or 21-position of  xxxd1729xxx  resulted in weaker prostanoid fp-receptor functional activities
than that of  xxxd1729xxx . the 16-phenyl-substituted types of
 xxxd1902xxx  derivatives [16-(m-tolyl) (afp-103) and 15-fluoro-16(m-tolyl) (afp-105)] induced constriction, but their effects
were weaker than that of the carboxylic acid of  xxxd2446xxx .

the effects of  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives on the melanin content of
cultured b16-f10 melanoma cells are shown in table 3. a

fig. 1. afps-172, 157 and 162 were chosen as the basic
structures for this experiment on the basis of the in vitro experiments. topical application of  xxxd2446xxx  at 0.001 to
0.01% induced a miosis, with pupillary diameter decreasing
to approximately 20% of control. afp-170 (afp-157 methyl

miosis of about the same magnitude as  xxxd2446xxx . on the
other hand, afp-169, 175 and 168 (methyl ester, ethyl ester

discussion
we synthesized new  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives and investigated
their prostanoid fp-receptor-mediated functional activities
both in vitro and in vivo. in our in vitro experiments, 15monofluoro derivatives caused constriction of the cat isolated

iris sphincter, suggesting that exchanging the 15-hydroxy
group for fluorine preserves prostanoid fp-agonistic activities, in keeping with the findings on 15-monofluoro  xxxd1902xxx 
published by nigamatov et al.28) furthermore, we found that
15,15-difluoro derivatives (namely, afps-162, 164, 157 and
172) also retained the iris constrictor activity. when the iris
constrictor activities of a mono-fluoro derivative (afp-159)
and a difluoro derivative (afp-162) were compared, afp162 was found to be the more potent of the two (table 2). interestingly, 15,15-difluoro derivatives, such as afp-172 and
afp-157, did not increase the melanin content of cultured
b16-f10 melanoma cells, although a carboxylic acid of
 xxxd2446xxx  did, as reported by other investigators.29) taken
together, these observations suggest that fluorine atom(s) in
the 15-position of the structure contributes, at least in part, to
increase the  xxxg1878xxx -related activities and to reduce the
side effects such as melanogenesis.
for our in vivo experiments we used esterified 15,15-difluoro derivatives, which induced stronger constrictions in the
cat iris sphincter than a carboxylic acid of  xxxd2446xxx , because the ester forms of  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives are well known to
improve the corneal permeability of the free-acid forms of
the derivatives.30) when topically applied, the methyl ester
forms of afps-162, 157 and 172 each induced a significant
miosis in cats in a dose-dependent manner. their effects at
inducing miosis seemed to be consistent with their in vitro
activities. although the in vitro activities of afps-162 and
157 were 6 to 7 times greater than that of a carboxylic acid of
 xxxd2446xxx  (table 2), this was not the case in the in vivo experiment (fig. 1). however, the methyl, ethyl and isopropyl
ester forms of afp-172 (each at 0.0001%) reduced pupillary
diameter in the cat eye to the same extent as 0.001%
 xxxd2446xxx . a similar relationship was observed in the iop
experiment, in which the ocular-hypotensive effect of
0.0005%  xxxd3274xxx  (a isopropyl ester form of afp-172) was
equivalent to that of 0.005%  xxxd2446xxx  in conscious ocularnormotensive monkeys (fig. 2). these results indicate that
15,15-difluoro  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives can exhibit potent prostanoid
fp-receptor agonistic activities in the eye.
 xxxd1902xxx  -derivative
ophthalmic
solutions,
including
 xxxd2446xxx  solution, have been reported to cause an iris
colour change and dark skin around the eye as side effects.11—20) in cultured melanoma cells, a carboxylic acid of
 xxxd2446xxx  has been reported to increase melanogenesis31)
and the results obtained in the present study confirm this report. however, the stimulatory effects on melanin content in
cultured b16-f10 melanoma cells in our experiment did not
correlate with the prostanoid fp-receptor agonistic activities
of the 15,15-difluoro derivatives. the mechanism underlying
this phenomenon remains to be revealed, but the lack of stimulatory effects of 15,15-difluoro derivatives on melanin content in these cultured cells may mean that topical application
of the ester types of the derivatives may cause pigmentation
less frequently or less severely than  xxxd2446xxx . future longterm topical-application studies with 15,15-difluoro derivatives in monkeys and/or in the clinic will be required to test
this idea.
in conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo findings indicate
that the new 15-monofluoro and 15,15-difluoro  xxxd1902xxx  derivatives tested here have potent prostanoid fp-agonistic activities with minimal side effects. these derivatives are worthy
