abstract. previous studies had indicated that the effects of  xxxd1806xxx  on rat peripheral
tissues were mediated through both androgen and estrogen receptors. the purpose of
this study was to examine the role of androgen and estrogen receptors in  xxxd1806xxx 
suppression of luteinizing hormone (lh) in the rat. the  xxxg730xxx  antagonist,
ly 156758, partially antagonized the suppressed levels of lh observed 3-5 hr after
administration of  xxxd1806xxx  to ovariectomized rats. in contrast, the  xxxg183xxx 
antagonist,  xxxd2143xxx , had no effect on suppressed lh levels 3-5 hr after  xxxd1806xxx , but
did partially reverse the inhibition of lh 24 hr after  xxxd1806xxx  administrationto ovariectomized rats.  xxxd1806xxx  also increased pituitary  xxxg1737xxx  levels, an estrogensensitive end point. these data indicate that the suppressed levels of lh following
 xxxd1806xxx  treatment resulted from the functional activation of both androgen and estrogen
receptors.

he pharmacologic profile of  xxxd1806xxx  has been the
subject of several studies and vanes depending
on the species and route of drug administration.
in the rat,  xxxd1806xxx  has been shown to be both androgenic and antigonadotropic (1,2). a report demonstrating that the luteinizing hormone (lh) inhibitory effects
of  xxxd1806xxx  were partially antagonized or absent in both
 xxxd2143xxx -treated male rats and in androgen receptordeficient rats indicated that the antigonadotropic effect
was androgen-receptor mediated ( 3 ) .
there have been conflicting reports regarding the
interaction of  xxxd1806xxx  with the  xxxg730xxx . for
example,  xxxd1806xxx  did not bind to the  xxxg730xxx 
in vitro (4-6) but was reported to increase accumulation
of estrogen receptors in pituitary cell nuclei of ovariectomized (ovx) rats (5). the authors of the latter study
suggested that  xxxd1806xxx  interacted with pituitary or hy-

pothalamic estrogen receptors to inhibit gonadotropin
production or release. recently, we reported that  xxxd1806xxx  induced estrogen-specific responses in the rat but
these effects were partially or wholly masked by the
inherent androgenic activity of the drug (7). when the
androgenic activity was antagonized with an antiandrogen such as  xxxd2143xxx , the estrogenic effects (vaginal
keratinization and increased uterine  xxxg1737xxx  levels) were fully expressed. we suggested that,
while the androgenic and estrogenic effects of  xxxd1806xxx 
are antagonistic in peripheral target tissues, they may
be complementary with regard to the inhibition of
gonadotropin secretion at the level of the hypothalamus
or pituitary (7). the purpose of this study was to
examine the role of androgen and estrogen receptors in
 xxxd1806xxx  suppression of lh in the rat.
materials and methods
adult ovx sprague-dawley rats weighing 220240 g were obtained from taconic farms, inc., germantown, ny, and utilized 7 days after castration. the
rats were maintained in temperature- and light-controlled rooms at approximately 24°c and 12 hr of light
(lights on at 0600). animals were provided chow and
tap water ad libitum.  xxxd1806xxx  was administered orally
by gavage at a dose of 400 mg/kg.  xxxd2143xxx  was

administered either orally (40 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (50 mg/kg). the  xxxg730xxx  antagonist, ly
156758 (10 mg/kg),  xxxd2038xxx  (8 pg/kg), and
testosterone (25 mg/kg) were injected subcutaneously.
all compounds were administered in a vehicle of
ethano1:cottonseed oil ( 1 :9 v/v) in a volume of either
10 ml/kg orally or 1 ml/kg subcutaneously.
 xxxd1806xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx  were synthesized at sterling
research group, rensselaer, ny. ly 156758 ( xxxd3074xxx ) was donated by eli lilly co., indianapolis, in.
 xxxd2038xxx  and testosterone were purchased
from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo.
blood samples were obtained from rats either via
jugular vein puncture under light ether anesthesia or
by collection of trunk blood after decapitation. blood
samples were allowed to clot at room temperature,
centrifuged (looog for 15 min), and the serum was
collected and stored frozen at -20°c until it was assayed
for lh content.
lh radioimmunoassay. serum lh levels were
measured by double antibody radioimmunoassay. reagents for the rat lh (rlh) radioimmunoassay were
obtained from the following sources: rlh reference
standard, highly purified rlh for iodination, and rlh
antiserum were either provided by dr. salvatore raiti
at niaddk or purchased from dr. a. f. parlow,
pituitary hormones and antisera center, harbourucla medical center, torrence, ca. rabbit y-globulin and anti-rabbit y-globulin (goat) were purchased
from antibodies incorporated, davis, ca. iodination
(i2’i) of highly purified rlh was performed by dr.
george butterstein, union college, schenectady, ny.
serum lh levels are expressed as nanograms of
niaddk rlh-rp-2/ml. intra- and interassay coefficient of variations ranged from 3.4 to 9.5% for the
former and 7.4 to 10.7% for the latter.
 xxxg1737xxx  assay. all procedures
relating to the quantification of rat pituitary cytosol
 xxxg1737xxx  (pgr) levels were accomplished
at 0-4°c and represent a modification of a previously
reported method (7) as described below in brief. pituitaries were homogenized (approximately 20 mg tissue/
ml) in temdg buffer ( 10 m m tris(hydroxymethy1)
aminomethane, 2 m m na,-edta, 20 mm sodium
molybdate, 2 m m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, ph 7.4)
using a motor-driven ground glass homogenizer and
centrifuged at 50,ooog for 1 hr. aliquots of the supernatants (cytosol fraction) were incubated with 10 nm
[ 17,rnethyl-3h]r5020 (87 ci/mm; new england nuclear corp., boston, ma) in either the absence (total
binding) or presence of a 200-fold molar excess of
unlabeled r5020 (nonspecific binding) for 3 hr. following the incubation period, a suspension of dextrancoated charcoal (1 % charcoal, 0.05% dextran t-70)
was added to the ligand-cytosol preparation and incubated for 10 min. the charcoal bound [3h]r5020 was

removed by centrifugation (1500g for 10 min) and the
supernatant (protein-bound [3h]r5020) counted using
a packard model 4640 scintillation counter, packard
instrument co., downers grove, il. the data are
expressed as fmol [3h]r5020 specific binding (total
minus nonspecific) per mg of cytosol protein. cytosol
protein concentration was determined using the bradford protein assay (8) with bovine y-globulin as the
protein standard.
statistics. statistical comparisons between treatment means for lh data were made using either student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance. after
finding a significant f value by analysis of variance, a
newman-keuls test was applied with the aid of a computer program (9) to determine differences between
pairs of means. treatment means for pituitary pgr
content were compared using dunnett’s test.
results
preliminary studies demonstrated that  xxxd1806xxx 
suppressed circulating lh levels in ovx rats when
administered orally at doses ranging from 25 to 400
mg/kg. the magnitude and duration of lh suppression
following a single, oral administration of  xxxd1806xxx  was
dose related. a dose of 400 mg/kg  xxxd1806xxx  was most
consistent in producing a significant inhibition of lh
within 3 hr of treatment and having an effect that lasted
at least 24 hr (fig. 1). hence, only data from rats treated
with this dose was included in this report. at both 3 hr
and 5 hr after a single dose of  xxxd1806xxx , the antiestrogen,
ly 156758, partially antagonized the drug-induced

suppression of lh (fig. 1); when given alone, ly
156758 had no effect on lh levels 3 and 5 hr later. ly
156758 did not antagonize the reduced levels of lh
observed 24 hr after  xxxd1806xxx  treatment. perhaps because the antiestrogen itself significantly reduced lh
levels at this time point.
a study illustrating the effect of  xxxd2143xxx  on the
suppression of lh after a single dose of  xxxd1806xxx  is
shown in figure 2.  xxxd2143xxx  (40 mg/kg orally) was
administered twice, 18 hr and 1 hr prior to medication
with  xxxd1806xxx .  xxxd2143xxx  did not antagonize the
suppression of lh observed at either 3 hr (fig. 2) or 5
hr (data not shown) after treatment with  xxxd1806xxx  (400
mg/kg). however,  xxxd2143xxx  did reverse the inhibition
of lh seen 24 hr after  xxxd1806xxx  treatment (fig. 2). a
number of experiments were performed in which  xxxd2143xxx  was administered by different routes (oral and
subcutaneous), at various doses (40- 100 mg/kg), and
at various times before or after a single  xxxd1806xxx  treatment. however, in each case we were unsuccessful in
antagonizing the early (3 or 5 hr) suppression of lh by
 xxxd1806xxx  (data not shown).
the effects of daily administration of  xxxd1806xxx  and
 xxxd2143xxx  for 9 consecutive days on serum lh are
shown in figure 3. serum lh levels progressively declined over several days in  xxxd1806xxx -treated ovx rats
and reached a minimum of less than 1 ng/ml after 36 days of treatment.  xxxd2143xxx  (50 mg/kg sc) partially
antagonized the lh suppressive effects of  xxxd1806xxx . similar results were obtained when this experiment was

significant effect on pituitary cytosol pgr levels.
discussion
we recently reported that orally administered  xxxd1806xxx  activated both androgen and estrogen receptormediated effects in the rat (7). although the intrinsic
androgenic activity partially or fully inhibited the
expression of the estrogenic effects of  xxxd1806xxx  in pe-

lh

ripheral target tissues, we suggested that these two components of the drug’s activity profile would probably
act together to lower circulating lh levels.
the concept of a dual lh inhibitory mechanism
is supported by results of the present study showing
that ly 156758 partially reversed the early (3- to 5-hr)
lh inhibitory effects of a single  xxxd1806xxx  treatment.
however, since the antiestrogen itself reduced lh levels
24 hr after injection, it was not possible to determine
whether the inhibition of lh by  xxxd1806xxx  at this time
point was mediated by the  xxxg730xxx . thus,
these experiments suggest that the early effects of  xxxd1806xxx  on lh are, at least partially, mediated by the
 xxxg730xxx . the fact that  xxxd1806xxx  increased pituitary cytosol pgr levels (an estrogen specific effect)
in the present study provides further evidence that
estrogen receptors are functionally activated following
oral administration of  xxxd1806xxx .
we found no evidence that the early (3- to 5-hr)
inhibitory effects of  xxxd1806xxx  on lh were androgen
receptor mediated. the early suppressive effects of  xxxd1806xxx  on lh were not reversed, even when the animals
(and hence their androgen receptors) were given  xxxd2143xxx  twice daily for 4 days prior to  xxxd1806xxx  treatment
(data not shown). at a later time period, however, the
 xxxg183xxx  appeared to play a partial role in the
suppression of lh by  xxxd1806xxx . in most experiments,
 xxxd2143xxx  weakly antagonized the reduced levels of lh
observed 24 hr after a single  xxxd1806xxx  treatment. the
effect of  xxxd2143xxx  was small and reached statistical
significance in most, but not all, experiments. the weak
antagonism by  xxxd2143xxx  was also evident in ovx rats
medicated daily for 9 days. in these experiments,  xxxd1806xxx  suppressed lh to successively lower levels until an
apparent minimum was reached on day 9. although
 xxxd2143xxx  partially reversed the effects of  xxxd1806xxx  on
some of the early days, eventually the antiandrogen had
no effect on the complete inhibition of lh by  xxxd1806xxx .
this result has been observed repeatedly in experiments
using both adult ovx rats and castrated adult male
rats treated with  xxxd1806xxx  and  xxxd2143xxx  for 9 consecutive days. a partial reversal of  xxxd1806xxx -induced suppression of lh by  xxxd2143xxx  has also been reported in
castrated stanley-gumbreck male rats ( 3 ) . taken together, the results of these studies suggest that administration of  xxxd1806xxx  resulted in activation of both androgen and  xxxg730xxx -mediated events which
led to a suppression of lh. it should be noted that
these interpretations are based on the assumption that
ly 156758 and  xxxd2143xxx  are acting solely as estrogen
or androgen antagonists and are not affecting the phar-

macology or metabolism of  xxxd1806xxx  in some unknown
manner.
previous studies have suggested that orally administered  xxxd1806xxx  may activate  xxxg730xxx -mediated events in the rat. for example,  xxxd1806xxx  has been
reported to increase the accumulation of estrogen receptors in pituitary cell nuclei (9,induce vaginal keratinization in the presence of an antiandrogen (7), and
increase uterine cytosol pgr levels (7). furthermore,
ly 156758 was shown to attenuate the uterotropic
effect of  xxxd1806xxx  (7). it is noteworthy that, in vitro,
 xxxd1806xxx  does not bind the rat  xxxg730xxx  (4-6).
this fact suggests that orally administered  xxxd1806xxx  may
be metabolized to one or more compounds that subsequently activate  xxxg730xxx -mediated events.
this study demonstrated that an early phase of lh
inhibition following oral administration of  xxxd1806xxx  was
partially reversed by the antiestrogen, ly 156758. in
contrast, the suppression of lh seen 24 hr after  xxxd1806xxx 
administration was attenuated by  xxxd2143xxx , indicating
that this effect was, at least partially, mediated by
activation of the  xxxg183xxx . it is likely that, at
any given time point, the suppression of lh by  xxxd1806xxx 
was not mediated exclusively by either estrogen or
androgen receptors, but rather, a combination of both.
