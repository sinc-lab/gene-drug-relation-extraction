understanding the mechanism of action and the pharmacokinetic properties
of vasodilatory drugs facilitates optimal use in clinical practice. it should be kept
in mind that a drug belongs to a class but is a distinct entity, sometimes derived
from a prototype to achieve a specific effect. the most common pharmacokinetic
drug improvement is the development of a drug with a half-life sufficiently long
to allow an adequate once-daily dosage. developing a controlled release preparation can increase the apparent half-life of a drug. altering the molecular structure may also increase the half-life of a prototype drug. another desirable
improvement is increasing the specificity of a drug, which may result in fewer
adverse effects, or more efficacy at the target site. this is especially important
for vasodilatory drugs which may be administered over decades for the treatment
of hypertension, which usually does not interfere with subjective well-being.
compliance is greatly increased with once-daily dosing.

kirsten et al.

vasodilatory agents cause relaxation by either a decrease in cytoplasmic calcium, an increase in  xxxd2738xxx  (no) or by inhibiting myosin light chain kinase.
they are divided into 9 classes: calcium antagonists,  xxxg1232xxx  openers,
ace inhibitors, angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists, alpha-adrenergic and imidazole
receptor antagonists,  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, eicosanoids and no donors.
despite chemical differences, the pharmacokinetic properties of calcium antagonists are similar. absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is high, with all
substances undergoing considerable first-pass metabolism by the liver, resulting
in low bioavailability and pronounced individual variation in pharmacokinetics.
renal impairment has little effect on pharmacokinetics since renal elimination of
these agents is minimal. except for the newer drugs of the dihydropyridine type,
amlodipine,  xxxd2092xxx , isradipine,  xxxd2726xxx ,  xxxd2734xxx  and  xxxd2737xxx , the
half-life of calcium antagonists is short. maintaining an effective drug concentration for the remainder of these agents requires multiple daily dosing, in some
cases even with controlled release formulations. however, a coat-core preparation of nifedipine has been developed to allow once-daily administration. adverse
effects are directly correlated to the potency of the individual calcium antagonist.
treatment with the  xxxg1232xxx  opener  xxxd2649xxx  is reserved for patients with moderately severe to severe hypertension which is refractory to other
treatment.  xxxd1868xxx  and hydralazine are chiefly used to treat severe hypertensive
emergencies, primary pulmonary and malignant hypertension and in severe preeclampsia.
ace inhibitors prevent conversion of angiotensin-i to angiotensin-ii and are
most effective when renin production is increased. since ace is identical to
kininase-ii, which inactivates the potent endogenous vasodilator bradykinin, ace
inhibition causes a reduction in bradykinin degradation. ace inhibitors exert
cardioprotective and cardioreparative effects by preventing and reversing cardiac
fibrosis and ventricular hypertrophy in animal models. the predominant elimination pathway of most ace inhibitors is via renal excretion. therefore, renal
impairment is associated with reduced elimination and a dosage reduction of 25
to 50% is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
separating angiotensin-ii inhibition from bradykinin potentiation has been the
goal in developing angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists. the incidence of adverse
effects of such an agent, losartan, is comparable to that encountered with placebo
treatment, and the troublesome cough associated with ace inhibitors is absent.

the contractile potential of vascular smooth
muscle is calcium dependent. increasing evidence
indicates that vasodilatory agents ultimately cause
relaxation by either reducing the cytoplasmic calcium level of the vascular smooth muscle cells[1-3]
or interfering with the mechanisms linking calcium
with the contractile machinery. investigators have
shown that a factor which desensitises vascular
endothelial cells to calcium is another way leading
to vasodilation.[4,5] though direct action of vaso© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

dilatory agents on the contractile machinery of the
smooth muscle cell has been shown to take place,
the contractile mechanism is so highly calcium
dependent, such that even ‘direct’ action on the
contractile machinery is likely to be calcium dependent.
four modes of reducing the cytoplasmic calcium
level in the cell are shown in figure 1, as well as
proposals by which calcium depletion may be induced by different drug types.

high cytoplasmic cellular calcium levels cause
vascular smooth muscle contraction via calciumcalmodulin and myosin light chain kinase, enabling
myosin to interact with actin, thereby initiating
contraction. at low cytoplasmic calcium levels,
contraction cannot occur. ‘direct’ vasodilatory influence on the contractile machinery takes place
through  xxxd2738xxx  (no),[6] the intracellular second-messenger cgmp or by inhibiting myosin
light chain kinase via camp-dependent protein
kinase. high no levels result in relaxation. whatever the target site, all vasodilatory drugs cause
either a decrease in cytoplasmic calcium, an increase
in no or inhibit myosin light chain kinase.[7] nine
clinically important drug types with vasodilatory
action aim at different target sites (table i).
the pharmacokinetics for each drug type of the
most frequently prescribed vasodilatory drugs in
germany in 1994[8] are described in some detail,
generally in the order of prescription frequency.

1. calcium antagonists
the most commonly employed calcium antagonists/channel blockers can be divided into 3 subtypes according to chemical structure. verapamil and
its derivative, gallopamil, are phenylalkylamines,
diltiazem is a benzothiazepine and nifedipine and
its many derivatives are dihydropyridines.
despite chemical differences, the pharmacokinetic properties of the calcium antagonists are

similar (table ii). absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is high, with all substances undergoing
considerable first-pass metabolism by the liver,
resulting in low bioavailability[10] and extremely
pronounced individual variation in pharmacokinetics.[11] reduced presystemic elimination (decreased
intrinsic clearance), old age or hepatic impairment
(including decreased hepatic blood flow) will increase plasma concentrations of calcium antagonists.[12]
drugs or food that affect hepatic blood flow or
drug metabolic capacity possess predictable interaction potential. renal impairment has little effect
on pharmacokinetic characteristics of calcium
antagonists since renal elimination is minimal.
except for the newer drugs of the dihydropyridine type, amlodipine,  xxxd2092xxx , isradipine,  xxxd2726xxx ,  xxxd2734xxx  and  xxxd2737xxx , the t1⁄2 of the
calcium antagonists is relatively short.[12] maintaining an effective drug concentration for the remainder of the calcium antagonists requires multiple
daily doses, in some cases even when administering a controlled release form.
the likelihood of compliance (good if the drug
has a long t1⁄2 allowing single daily dosing, poor
with a short t1⁄2 requiring multiple daily dosing),[13]
the potential for interaction with other drugs and
adverse effects are important considerations in pre© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

scription practice. the decision about which drug
to prescribe varies from patient to patient after reviewing the aforementioned factors and weighing
individual circumstances.
most of the calcium antagonists have one or
more chiral centres. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drug enantiomers are different. for example, equimolarly absorbed d- and lverapamil change their relative concentrations in
vivo because l-verapamil has a higher first-pass
effect (80 vs 50%) than d-verapamil, a higher vd
(6.4 vs 2.7 l/kg), higher clearance (18.3 vs 10.2
ml/min/kg), a shorter t1⁄2 (4.8 vs 4.1h) and lower
protein binding (89 vs 93.6%).[14] this results in a
decrease of the negative chronotropic and inotropic
effect of l-verapamil in favour of the vasodilatory
effect of both enantiomers. after intravenous (iv)
verapamil administration, the relative amount of
l-verapamil remains higher than after oral administration, resulting in more adverse effects such as
bradycardia, heart block or heart failure. two recent reviews describe stereochemical aspects.[15,16]
verapamil and diltiazem inhibit the hepatic
metabolism of numerous drugs. this characteristic
can be exploited positively (reduction of dose), but
if not taken into account, clinically significant drug
interactions may occur. though specific interactions have been identified, the potential for interclin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

action with any drug undergoing oxidative hepatic
metabolism should be considered when prescribing verapamil or diltiazem. nifedipine has little or
no effect on the hepatic metabolism of other drugs,
making interactions with other drugs less likely.[17]
however, the short t1⁄2 of nifedipine makes multiple
daily doses of even most controlled release forms
necessary, which may hinder compliance.
the successor drugs of nifedipine, such as amlodipine,  xxxd2092xxx , isradipine,  xxxd2726xxx , or
 xxxd2737xxx  have a longer t1⁄2, allowing single daily
dosing. a coat-core preparation of nifedipine has
been developed which allows single daily dosing.[18]
nifedipine is distributed throughout the hydrophillic polymerised coat, which dissolves layer by
layer over 6 to 8 hours. the nifedipine contained
in the core is released more quickly, avoiding the
decrease below therapeutically effective concentrations, observed with other controlled release nifedipine preparations. clinical problems and adverse effects associated with nifedipine occur in
17 to 20% of patients, in 8 to 10% of patients receiving verapamil and in 2 to 5% of patients receiving
diltiazem.[10,19,20] these incidences are directly
correlated to the potency of the drugs.

1.1 nifedipine

coronary heart disease, hypertension,[21-23] raynaud’s disease[24] and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy[25] are indications for the use of nifedipine.
arterial smooth muscle and resistance vessels are
the main target sites.
nifedipine is available in capsule (5, 10, 20mg),
tablet (5, 10, 20mg) and controlled release tablet
(20mg) form. for coronary disease, capsules or
tablets are administered 3 times daily, controlled
release tablets twice daily. for hypertension and
raynaud’s disease, the 5mg dose is not generally
employed. otherwise administration is the same as
for coronary heart disease. to control a hypertensive crisis, a capsule is bitten and the contents swallowed. intracoronary nifedipine is administered in
a dose of 5mg over 4 to 8 hours.
in acutely hypertensive patients the effects of
nifedipine 10mg sublingually are seen in 1 to 5
minutes, with peak effects in 20 to 30 minutes and
antihypertensive effects lasting 4 to 5 hours.[26]
orally administered nifedipine is absorbed
throughout the gastrointestinal tract, with absorption mainly taking place in the upper small intestine. although orally administered nifedipine is
clin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

462

almost completely absorbed, systemic availability
is only approximately 50%, due to first-pass metabolism.[27,28]
typical plasma concentrations range from 10
to 200 mug/l, with a lowest therapeutic plasma concentration to decrease diastolic blood pressure (bp)
of 10 to 15 mug/l. even with pooled data, poor correlation between nifedipine plasma concentration
and antihypertensive efficacy has been observed.[29]
the large differences in peak plasma concentrations (cmax) and in areas under the curve (auc)
after oral administration are due to interindividual
variation in the first-pass effect.[27-29] the protein
binding of nifedipine is up to 98%, due to the lipophilic character of the drug. the vd during steadystate is 0.77 l/kg.[28] the terminal t1⁄2 ranges from
1.9 hours for a 10mg tablet to 15.2 hours for a 20mg
controlled release tablet.
nifedipine is metabolised in the liver to inactive
metabolites. the total clearance of nifedipine and
its metabolites is about 6.4 ml/min/kg [28] or 7
ml/min/kg.[29] another source gives a value of 10
ml/min/kg.[30]
dose adjustment of nifedipine is not required in
renal failure.[13,31,32] although lower plasma concentrations of nifedipine have been observed in
haemodialysis patients, these differences are not
considered significant.[33] cirrhotic patients have
shown a 4-fold increase in the elimination t1⁄2 of
nifedipine and a 2-fold increase in auc. these patients are at increased risk for accumulation and
potential toxicity, so that dose reduction should be
considered.[34]
nifedipine has been detected in fetal cord blood
and amniotic fluid. it is embryotoxic in animal
experiments and is therefore contraindicated during pregnancy. however, one study has shown that
nifedipine caused less fetal distress than dihydralazine, when employed in patients with severe preeclampsia between 27 to 35 weeks gestation.[35] the
terminal elimination t1⁄2 of nifedipine is shorter in
pregnancy-induced hypertension.[36] nifedipine reduces platelet thromboxane a2 production, thought
to be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy, without changing aggregation.[37]

nifedipine enters breast milk. however, it has been
estimated that an infant would ingest only 3% of
the weight adjusted maternal dose.[38] no damage
to an infant has ever been reported.
nifedipine has been used in paediatric malignant hypertension.[21-23] plasma clearance of nifedipine decreases with age. geriatric patients have
shown 36% increases in cmax and 70% greater average plasma concentrations, when compared to
younger patients. hypotensive effects and adverse
reactions are exaggerated in older patients, [39-41]
making vigilant monitoring compulsory and dose
reduction sometimes necessary.
flushing, headache, feeling of heat in lower
extremities and nausea are frequent adverse effects.
dizziness, fatigue, paraesthesia, reflex tachycardia
and ankle oedema are occasional adverse effects.
severe adverse drug reactions (hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure) increase with advanced
age (risk for 70 year old patients about 1.1%).[19]
because of additive vasodilating effects, combining nifedipine and  xxxd3000xxx  results in marked hypotension. nifedipine and diltiazem enhance the
antihypertensive effect and increase nifedipine
plasma concentrations.[41] the plasma digoxin concentration may be increased.[42,43] quinidine concentration may decrease, with disproportionate
increase after nifedipine withdrawal.[42] theophylline plasma concentration can increase or decrease.[17] the reason for this discrepancy has not
yet been clarified. cimetidine and ranitidine cause
increased nifedipine concentrations with augmented
bp reduction.[42]
1.2 verapamil

indications for the use of verapamil include:
coronary heart disease, hypertension, raynaud’s disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal
supraventricular reentry tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation or flutter except in wolff-parkinson-white
syndrome (risk of ventricular tachycardia). the
main target sites are arterial smooth muscle, resistance vessels, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal
tissues.

verapamil is available in tablet form of 40, 80,
120, 160mg, to be administered 3 to 4 times daily
for antianginal therapy, 2 to 3 times daily for antihypertensive therapy.[44] controlled release tablets
of 120, 180, 240mg verapamil are administered
once daily.[44,45] because of a marked increase in
the vd (5.6 l/kg) obese patients require higher
doses of iv verapamil than patients with normal
weight (4.1 l/kg).[46] typical verapamil plasma
concentrations range from 80 to 400 mug/l.[14,47] a
significant relationship between verapamil plasma
concentrations and a prolonged pr interval, as an
easily measurable pharmacodynamic parameter,
has been established.[48,49] the antihypertensive
ec50 (concentration producing 50% of maximal
bp response) after oral administration of verapamil is 40 mug/l. above 100 mug/l the pr interval is
more than 10% prolonged.[50] the total systemic
clearance approaches liver blood flow.[14]
verapamil is metabolised mainly in the liver
with a typical elimination t1⁄2 of approximately 5
hours.[50,51] after a single oral dose the bioavailability is only about 24%.[51] significantly higher
bioavailability can be achieved by administration
in the evening (2200h), rather than in the morning
(0800h).[52] food intake shows little effect on the
antihypertensive efficacy.[53] a high intra-individual
biological variability in verapamil pharmacokinetics complicates bioequivalence assessment and
may lead to erroneous conclusions about observed
differences of measured values.[54]
the protein binding of verapamil is approximately 90% and is not concentration dependent.
the renal clearance is 15 ml/min/kg. [52] dose
adjustment in renal failure patients is not necessary.[55,56] liver cirrhosis decreases total systemic
clearance and increases the oral bioavailability of
verapamil. the pharmacodynamic response is altered in patients with hepatic disease[14] and the
dose of verapamil should consequently be reduced.[57,58]
no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects of verapamil have been reported during pregnancy. verapamil has been employed in pre-eclampsia without
affecting uteroplacental or umbilical artery resis© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

tance.[59] fetal supraventricular tachycardia has been
treated with a combination of digoxin and verapamil.[60] the drug has been used as a hypotensive
and tocolytic agent during pregnancy.[61] it is excreted in milk in concentrations equivalent to those
found in maternal serum. treatment of nursing
mothers should be avoided,[52,61] since alternatives
are available.
children may be treated with verapamil. reports about pharmacokinetics in the elderly show
varied results. some studies found no significant
effect of age on the pharmacokinetic profile. [62,63]
however, other reports list higher oral bioavailability and prolonged t1⁄2 values in older patients.[64]
pharmacokinetics are more variable in older than
in younger patients. careful clinical evaluation is
therefore suggested.[62,63] the antihypertensive response in elderly patients to dose increases of verapamil was 20% of that in younger patients.[64,65]
no age-related gradient for severe adverse drug reactions could be established.[19]
flushing and headache are typical adverse effects of verapamil. occasionally, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, paraesthesia or ankle oedema
may occur. due to myocardial depression, verapamil is contraindicated in patients with sinus node
disease and unstable atrioventricular block. combining verapamil with beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic
agents and inhaled anaesthetics may lead to enhanced cardiovascular effects such as av block,
bradycardia, hypotension or heart failure.[66-69] iv
beta-blockers should not be administered to patients
receiving verapamil.[70] the clearance of the lipophilic beta-blockers propranolol and metoprolol is
affected by verapamil.
verapamil may increase the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents.[71] verapamil increases
the serum concentration of digitalis,[43,72] cyclosporin[73] and theophylline.[74] therefore, digoxin
doses should be adjusted by determining the serum
concentration and reducing accordingly if verapamil is coadministered.[75] coadministration of
verapamil and quinidine increases serum concentrations of quinidine and increases the t1⁄2 of veraclin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

464

pamil.[76] verapamil inhibits the oxidation of quinidine.
concomitant verapamil and carbamazepine administration may cause increased carbamazepine
plasma concentrations and increased neurotoxicity.[77] serum concentrations of verapamil are reduced with rifampicin (rifampin), phenytoin and
phenobarbital.[78] rifampicin decreases bioavailability and increases the oral clearance of verapamil
by preferentially inducing prehepatic cytochrome
p450 (cyp) enzymes.[79] serum concentrations of
lithium may be reduced, but the sensitivity to and
neurotoxicity of lithium may be increased.[80] an
increase in verapamil serum concentration is possible with concomitant cimetidine use.[81] patients
with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy have
developed hypotension and pulmonary oedema
with concomitant use of quinidine. [76] additive
effects of verapamil with other antihypertensive
agents should be considered.[82-84]
gallopamil is a methoxyderivative of verapamil
and has similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.[85-87]
1.3 diltiazem

the indications for use of diltiazem are coronary heart disease, hypertension, paroxysmal supraventricular re-entry tachycardia and atrial fibrillation or flutter except in wolff-parkinson-white
syndrome (risk of ventricular tachycardia). diltiazem holds a position of intermediate specificity
between nifedipine and verapamil on vascular
smooth muscle and heart. recently, a significant
dose-dependent decrease in coronary vascular resistance has been demonstrated.[88]
diltiazem is available in tablet form (60 and
120mg 3 times daily) for coronary heart disease or
antihypertensive therapy. controlled release tablets
90, 120, 180, 240mg are administered twice daily.
recently, a 300mg controlled release capsule, administered once daily, has been introduced. [89]
diltiazem is metabolised mainly in the liver with
a typical elimination t1⁄2 of around 5 hours. the absolute bioavailability in healthy individuals is 35 to
40%.[89] typical plasma concentrations range from
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

kirsten et al.

50 to 300 mug/l. the ec50 for prolongation of the
pr interval has been reported at 82 mug/l. plasma
protein binding is about 82% and vd is 3 to 6 l/kg.[90-92]
the systemic plasma clearance in healthy volunteers
is 11.8 ml/min/kg.[92] this value decreases more
than 2-fold with multiple doses.[14] there is a strong
relation between plasma diltiazem concentration
and percent heart rate reduction.[93]
the pharmacokinetic profile of diltiazem in patients with severe renal failure is similar to that in
patients with normal renal function. since the apparent plasma t1⁄2 is hardly influenced by renal failure, drug dose adjustment need not be initiated.[94]
the pharmacokinetics in patients undergoing
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis do not
differ from those in healthy volunteers.[95] somewhat higher plasma concentrations in patients with
chronic renal failure suggest altered distribution
processes.[96] higher risk of adverse effects can be
expected if an abnormality of hepatic function is
present.[97] the drug dose must be reduced in patients with hepatic disease.[98]
during pregnancy and lactation the same caution must be exercised in administering diltiazem
as for verapamil. diltiazem has been used as a hypotensive and tocolytic agent during pregnancy.[59]
children may be treated with diltiazem. for children with primary pulmonary hypertension, calcium
antagonists, including diltiazem, have been shown
to be the most effective agents.[99] pharmacokinetics are not changed with age.[14] in patients aged
over 65 years the bioavailability is increased. a
precautionary initial daily dose of less than 300mg
seems advisable.[89]
adverse effects associated with diltiazem are
less frequent than those encountered with verapamil. typical adverse effects are headache, dizziness, fatigue, paraesthesia and ankle oedema. interactions with other drugs are much the same as
described for verapamil.[17,42] both calcium antagonists decrease digoxin and  xxxd192xxx  ( xxxd192xxx )
metabolism, which results in increases in plasma
concentrations of these drugs. carbamazepine concentrations in patients rise when diltiazem is added.
nifedipine should preferably be prescribed for paclin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

vasodilators: part i

tients with seizure disorders, since this calcium
antagonist has less apparent effects on hepatic oxidative enzymes.[17]
cyclosporin blood clearance decreases from 18
to 11 ml/min/kg after diltiazem treatment. a 28%
reduction in the cyclosporin dose requirement is
of clear benefit to renal transplant patients.[100]
diltiazem also counteracts the deleterious effect of
cyclosporin on the renal vascular system, thought
to be caused by calcium overload as a consequence
of chronically augmented calcium influx.[101]
1.4  xxxd2737xxx 

the indications for  xxxd2737xxx  use are the
same as those for nifedipine.  xxxd2737xxx , unlike
diltiazem, verapamil or nifedipine does not alter
conduction through the sinus or av nodes.[102] nor
do significant changes in pq, qrs, qt intervals
or av conduction occur.[103]
 xxxd2737xxx  is available in tablet form (10 and
20mg), and is administered once or twice daily to
treat mild to moderate hypertension. the initial
dose is usually 10mg once daily, titrated over several weeks to a maximum of 40 mg/day in 1 or 2
doses.[104,105] a  xxxd2649xxx  containing 5mg  xxxd2737xxx  is also available for iv administration to treat
hypertensive crisis.
cmax for  xxxd2737xxx  is reached after 1.5 hours.
however, clinical effects with onset of activity 2
hours after administration do not correlate well with
plasma concentrations.[106] the plasma concentration to achieve a 10% reduction of bp is about 5
mug/l.[107] oral bioavailability is 16 to 20%, plasma
protein binding is 98% and vd is 5.4 l/kg. hepatic
first-pass metabolism takes place. all metabolites
are inactive (the dihydropyridine ring is essential
for activity).[104] less than 0.1% is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine.[106] the clearance is 21
ml/min/kg. patients with low pretreatment plasma
renin activity are more likely to respond well to
 xxxd2737xxx  therapy than patients with high plasma
renin activity.[104]
although t1⁄2 and cmax increase, dose adjustment
in patients with renal insufficiency is not necessary.[108-110] the terminal t1⁄2 (around 4 hours[107,111])

in dialysis patients is similar to that in patients with
normal renal function.[112] patients with hepatic failure have shown 2- to 3-fold increase in auc.[113,114]
due to enhanced bioavailability, a reduced dose of
5 to 10mg daily is recommended.[115]
 xxxd2737xxx  is contraindicated during pregnancy (embryotoxic in animal studies). the drug
appears in breast milk and should not be used during breast feeding.
 xxxd2737xxx  was found effective and safe in
treating resistant hypertension in 25 infants and
children.[116] a relationship between age and the
apparent plasma elimination t1⁄2 of  xxxd2737xxx  was
not observed.
contrasting reports about pharmacokinetics in
the aged have been published. kendall[117] has reported no differences in the young and the old. goa
and sorkin[104] have reported 3 times higher bioavailability and cmax in older patients. slower
elimination of  xxxd2737xxx  and higher plasma concentrations in the elderly may allow single daily
dosing of  xxxd2737xxx .[118]
the most frequently noted adverse effects of
 xxxd2737xxx  are headache, oedema, dizziness, fatigue, flushing and polyuria.[119] as with other calcium antagonists, coadministration of drugs dependent on hepatic metabolism, high degree of protein
binding and renal tubular excretion can cause altered plasma concentrations. although contrary
observations have been described, caution should
be exercised with additional administration of
 xxxd2737xxx  to digoxin-treated patients, and digitalis toxicity can occur.
1.5  xxxd2092xxx 

essential hypertension and coronary heart disease are indications for the use of  xxxd2092xxx .  xxxd2092xxx  acts 100 times more effectively on peripheral vessels than it does on myocardial tissue, [120]
making it an appropriate once-daily treatment for
hypertension.
 xxxd2092xxx  does not affect the pq interval[121,122]
and the function of the av and sa nodes.[123] the
negative inotropic effect of nifedipine or verapamil
is not observed with  xxxd2092xxx .[124] patients with
clin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

466

angina pectoris can benefit from  xxxd2092xxx  therapy,[125] since the drug dilates coronary arteries. [126]
mild natriuresis and diuresis have been observed,
without affecting potassium status.[127]
 xxxd2092xxx  is available in controlled release tablet form (2.5, 5 and 10mg). it is administered once
daily, and it is advisable to begin treatment with the
lowest dose, particularly in older patients. the oral
bioavailability is 16%.[128] the t1⁄2 of  xxxd2092xxx  is
11.4 hours. a hydrophillic gel matrix insures slow,
steady drug release, preventing high plasma concentrations. subsequent, sudden bp reduction, which
in turn may induce reflex tachycardia, and partly
compensate for the bp reduction,[129] is therefore
prevented.
a direct relationship between plasma  xxxd2092xxx 
concentration and antihypertensive effect has been
observed.[130] effective plasma concentrations for
reduction of diastolic bp range from 1 to 50
mug/l,[128,131,132] of which more than 99% is bound
to plasma proteins. the ec50 for diastolic bp reduction is 3 mug/l.[128] the vd is 10 l/kg and clearance 12 ml/min/kg.
renal disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2092xxx .[133,134] no dose adjustment
seems necessary in these patients. a disturbance in
hepatic function, either through hepatic failure or
through reduced hepatic circulation, due to uncompensated cardiac insufficiency, makes dose reduction necessary.
as has been observed for all dihydropyridines,
 xxxd2092xxx  also has caused fetal phalangeal defects
in animal studies. danielsson et al.[135] suggest that
the defects are not related to chemical structure
since nifedipine,  xxxd2737xxx ,  xxxd2092xxx  and
hydralazine administered to pregnant rabbits all
caused such defects. rather, a decrease in uteroplacental blood flow caused by these potent antihypertensive agents leads to excessive hypotension. this
is thought to be the most probable mechanism leading to the defects.[135]  xxxd2092xxx  appears in breast
milk and a breast-fed infant will ingest small quantities of the drug. experience with the risk for the
infant has not been gathered.

kirsten et al.

in a small group of renal transplant children,
pharmacokinetics were comparable to those for young
adults.[136] the t1⁄2 of  xxxd2092xxx  in older hypertonic
patients is 15 hours, 25 to 40% longer than normal.
the cmax of  xxxd2092xxx  increases with increasing
age. in the elderly, altered  xxxd2092xxx  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics lead to heightened
antihypertensive response.[137,138] dose reduction
should be considered.
oedema, flushing and headache are the most commonly reported adverse effects of  xxxd2092xxx . [139]
occasionally, stomach complaints, tachycardia
and dizziness are also reported.
the high vascular selectivity of  xxxd2092xxx  allows combination with beta-blockers.[140] the bp reduction induced by  xxxd2092xxx  can be increased by
concomitant administration of other antihypertensive drugs as well as tricyclic antidepressants.
concomitant administration of cimetidine or
erythromycin can result in increased plasma concentrations of  xxxd2092xxx . drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or barbiturates which, through enzyme induction in the liver cyp system, can lead
to a lower plasma concentration, make an increase
in the  xxxd2092xxx  dose necessary. in cyclosporintreated renal transplant recipients,  xxxd2092xxx  has
shown beneficial effects on bp, renal haemodynamics and renal sodium and water handling.[141,142]
cyclosporin may interfere with the metabolism of
 xxxd2092xxx  by inhibition of the activity of cyp, and
result in a highly variable pharmacokinetic profile
for  xxxd2092xxx .[127,143]
the dihydropyridine type of drug acts primarily
on vascular smooth muscle, verapamil acts mainly
on the heart and diltiazem shows intermediate
specificity. as a result, the dihydropyridines generally cause reflex tachycardia while verapamil,
gallopamil and diltiazem do not. both verapamil
and diltiazem directly slow the heart by acting on
the pacemaker.[10] verapamil and diltiazem show
tocolytic and hypotensive effects in pregnancy-induced hypertension. the dihydropyridines cannot
be used during pregnancy with the same impunity.

1.6 other calcium antagonists

in recent years new calcium antagonists have
been developed with the objective of reducing adverse effects and allowing once or twice daily administration. these second generation calcium antagonists have a longer elimination t1⁄2. some of the
newer dihydropyridines exhibit special features.
 xxxd2728xxx , selective for cerebral vasculature,
is used to prevent cerebral vasospasm following
subarachnoidal haemorrhage.[144,145] however, this
drug may not be administered to patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery.[146]
amlodipine and  xxxd2092xxx  have a much longer
t1⁄2 than other dihydropyridines and can be given
once daily.[147-150,128] less reflex tachycardia is observed with amlodipine than with nifedipine, possibly because the long t1⁄2 insures steady plasma
concentrations.[151-153] studies with  xxxd2092xxx  have
shown favourable haemodynamic effects in patients
with congestive heart failure.[154,155]
 xxxd2718xxx [156-158] causes less reduction in
myocardial contractility.[156,158]  xxxd2726xxx [159-161]
is vasoselective and shows no negative inotropic,
chronotropic or dromotropic effects.[162]  xxxd2734xxx  is useful in patients with concomitant coronary
disease.[163-167] isradipine has negative chronotropic effects and does not interfere with the av
node.[168,169]
2.  xxxg1232xxx  openers
and hydralazine
 xxxg1232xxx  openers cause potassium
channels in smooth muscle cells to open, permitting potassium efflux which causes hyperpolarisation and relaxation.[170] the  xxxg1232xxx 
openers  xxxd2649xxx  and  xxxd1868xxx  are known to activate atp-sensitive potassium channels. though
the mechanism of action of hydralazine has yet to
be elucidated, its site of action and therapeutic
properties are similar to proven  xxxg1232xxx 
openers, making its inclusion into the class of  xxxg1232xxx  openers reasonable.[171]

 xxxd2649xxx  acts primarily on arterioles. the absence of venous vasodilation leads to increased
venous return and a subsequent rise in heart rate,
cardiac output, cardiopulmonary blood volume
and pulmonary artery pressure.[172] additionally,
sodium and water are retained by the kidneys,
oedema often occurs and congestive heart failure
may occur. these adverse effects of the drug necessitate comedication with a diuretic and a drug
to control tachycardia, such as a beta-blocker.
hypertrichosis occurs in nearly all patients
treated for more than 4 weeks with  xxxd2649xxx .[173-175]
many female patients refuse to continue treatment
because of this adverse effect. in cases where  xxxd2649xxx  is the only medication which can control the
hypertension, cosmetic solutions to hypertrichosis
must be addressed to prevent reactive depression.[176]
many trials have shown that  xxxd2649xxx  can be
effectively employed to treat the most severe and
resistant forms of hypertension in adults and children. the drug has been used successfully in patients with severe uncontrollable hypertension,
while on maintenance haemodialysis, as an alternative to bilateral nephrectomy.[177,178] as opposed
to most antihypertensive medication,  xxxd2649xxx 
does not reduce left ventricular mass.[179]
the pharmacokinetic parameters of this group
of agents and hydralazine are shown in table iii.
2.1  xxxd2649xxx 

treatment with  xxxd2649xxx  is reserved for patients
with moderately severe to severe hypertension
which is refractory to other treatment. the drug acts
primarily on arterioles and has little effect on
venous capacitance vessels.[180] therefore, significant orthostatic hypotension is unlikely to occur.[181]
 xxxd2649xxx  is available as 2.5 and 10mg tablets.
the dose, ranging from 5 to 40mg (maximum
100mg), is given once or twice daily.
approximately 95% of a dose is absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract.[182] cmax is reached 30 to
60 minutes after administration.[183] effective plasma concentrations range from 20 to 100 mug/l.[180]

tion and bp response has been observed. the vd
is 2.7 l/kg. the drug is over 90% metabolised by
the liver into substances with considerably less
antihypertensive activity than  xxxd2649xxx  itself. the
elimination t1⁄2 is approximately 3 hours, but the
biological activity is longer (up to 75 hours after
administration)[184-186] making single daily dosing
possible.  xxxd2649xxx  does not pass the blood-brain
barrier.[187] it is almost exclusively excreted by the
kidneys. the clearance is 24 ml/min/kg. [175] only
1 to 3% is excreted in faeces.[184,185]
in renal insufficiency elimination is delayed[188]
and faecal excretion may increase to about 20%.[189]
 xxxd2649xxx  should be administered after dialysis,
since it is readily dialysable.[188] dialysis patients
require lower doses than non-dialysis patients.[183]
 xxxd2649xxx  increases liver blood flow. the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2649xxx  are not effected by hepatic
failure.
the benefits of  xxxd2649xxx  during pregnancy must
be carefully weighed against potential risk to the
unborn child.  xxxd2649xxx  appears in breast milk so
that breast feeding should be avoided during treatment.
a dose between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg is recommended in paediatric use. dose titration is advisable. there is no contraindication for the use of
 xxxd2649xxx  in the elderly.
adverse effects of  xxxd2649xxx  treatment are salt
and water retention, tachycardia, flattened and inverted t wave (often), angina, pericarditis (4%),
pericardial effusion (seldom), formation of antinuclear antibodies, stevens-johnson syndrome and
hypertrichosis (common). hypertrichosis has been
positively exploited by developing a topical application for treating male baldness. severe ortho© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

or alpha-blockers (except for chiefly or completely
selective  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -receptor blockers). neuroleptic drugs
can potentiate the antihypertensive efficacy of  xxxd2649xxx .
2.2  xxxd1868xxx  and hydralazine

 xxxd1868xxx  and hydralazine are chiefly used in
treating severe hypertensive emergencies, primary
pulmonary and malignant hypertension and in severe pre-eclampsia.[190-193] hydralazine is also administered to patients with chronic heart failure
to prevent the tolerance to haemodynamic effects
of nitrates,[194] though ace inhibitors are generally
favoured.[195,196] the effective plasma concentration to reduce mean bp by 20% is 35 mg/l for
 xxxd1868xxx  and 100 mug/l for hydralazine.[197,198] the
clearance for  xxxd1868xxx  is 0.06 ml/min/kg[197,199]
and 56 ml/min/kg for hydralazine.[198,200]
an adverse effect of hydralazine and  xxxd1868xxx 
is hyperglycaemia.[201] this adverse effect may be
useful for treatment of hyperinsulinism.[202] hydralazine can induce hepatitis,[203,204] lupus-like
syndrome,[205] and glomerulonephritis.[206] druginduced production of autoantibodies provides evidence of an autoimmune basis for these adverse
effects.[207]
3. ace inhibitors
ace inhibitors prevent conversion of angiotensin-i to the powerful vasoconstrictor, angiotensinii, and are most effective when renin production is
increased.[7] the most important biological function of  xxxg99xxx  is the direct vasoconstrictive
clin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

vasodilators: part i

action on arterioles. additionally, aldosterone secretion is stimulated, increasing bp by salt and
water retention. the sympathetic nervous system
is stimulated as well, and catecholamines are released.[208,209]
high sodium intake during ace inhibitor treatment may negate the bp lowering effect of the drug
and reduce efficacy in patients with coronary insufficiency. regular serum potassium measurement is advised during ace inhibitor treatment to
avoid high or low levels, depending on concomitant medication.
since ace is identical with kininase-ii, which
inactivates the potent endogenous vasodilator bradykinin,[210] ace inhibition causes an obligatory
reduction in bradykinin degradation. the absolute
contraindications to concomitant ace inhibitor
use, dialysis with poly(acrylonitrile, sodium-2-methallylsulfonate)-high-flux-membranes (for example ‘an 69’) or ldl aphoresis with dextransulfate
or desensitising with insect poisons, are due to the
potentiation of anaphylactic reactions.[211] potentiation occurs through blocked catabolism of bradykinin by ace inhibitors. ace inhibitor treated patients must be informed that exposure to insect
poisons or related allergens is a potential danger.
when captopril, the first ace inhibitor, was introduced, adverse effects such as rash, taste disturbance, neutropenia and severe proteinuria were
encountered. these have been attributed both to a
sulfhydryl group on the molecule and overdosage.
initially, captopril was administered 3 times daily
because of the relatively short apparent t1⁄2 of approximately 2 hours. however, the antihypertensive action is much longer, suggesting that the
concentration of the ace inhibitor in local tissues,
rather than in plasma, may more accurately relate
to the reduction in bp.[212,213]
generally, a single daily dose of all ace inhibitors, including captopril, is as effective as twice
daily doses. in second generation ace inhibitors
without the sulfhydryl group, these adverse effects
are absent.[7] good subjective tolerance of the ace
inhibitors is characteristic, aside from the persistent  xxxd1861xxx  which occurs in 10% of patients and

very rare, life-threatening adverse effects. insulin
resistance has been shown to be decreased with
ace inhibitors. the progression of renal insufficiency has also been shown to be more effectively
slowed by ace inhibition than with other antihypertensive drugs.[214]
the use of an angiotensin receptor antagonist
may circumvent the persistent  xxxd1861xxx , thought
to be caused by bradykinin accumulation, which
occurs in about 10%[215] of patients treated with an
ace inhibitor. however, it has also been argued
that some of the beneficial effects of ace inhibitors, such as reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, may be bradykinin mediated.[216,217]
ace inhibitors have been shown to exert cardioprotective[218] and cardioreparative[219] effects
by preventing and reversing cardiac fibrosis and
ventricular hypertrophy in animal models. several
large-scale studies have shown that the mortality
over 3.5 years after coronary infarct could be reduced by 20% with ace inhibitors.[220,221] studies
have shown that the choice of ace inhibitor is not
important in infarct-related heart failure.[222]
the predominant elimination pathway of most
ace inhibitors is excretion via the kidney. therefore, renal impairment is associated with reduced
elimination. the different pharmacokinetic parameters of the ace inhibitors (table iv) can influence the choice of ace inhibitor in patients with
renal failure and in patients undergoing haemodialysis.[223]
lisinopril and cilazaprilat accumulate (increase
in cmax and t1⁄2) in patients with renal failure. fosinopril is excreted to a large extent via the hepatobiliary pathway and does not accumulate in patients with renal failure. captopril, enalapril and
enalaprilat exhibit high elimination fractions by
haemodialysis, necessitating a supplemental dose
after dialysis.  xxxd3063xxx  and  xxxd1694xxx  are poorly
eliminated by haemodialysis.[224,225] for most ace
inhibitors a dosage reduction of 25 to 50% is recommended in patients with moderate to severe
impairment of renal function.[223] a small but significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate is
seen in patients with heart failure treated with ace

inhibitors. increase of renal blood flow counteracts
this decrease.[226] pharmacokinetic drug interactions with ace inhibitors have been summarised
in a recent review.[227]
benazepril,  xxxd1694xxx , enalapril, fosinopril,
perindopril,  xxxd3063xxx , ramipril and  xxxd3409xxx  are
all prodrugs designed to improve absorption from
the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolised in the
liver to the active substance. captopril and lisinopril are not prodrugs.
3.1 captopril

hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure are indications for the use of captopril. the
main action is a reduction of vascular resistance in
arteriolar and venous capacity vessels (balanced
action on preload and afterload) resulting in increased cardiac index.
captopril is available in 12.5, 25 and 50mg tablet form. once-daily administration for patients
with hypertension or chronic congestive heart failure has been shown to be as effective as twice daily
administration. the effective plasma concentration
(complete inhibition of ace) is about 50 mug/l.[228]
captopril is excreted largely unchanged in the
urine.[229] the renal clearance is 12 ml/min/kg. approximately 70% of an oral dose of captopril is
absorbed and the absolute bioavailability is about
60%.[230] food intake decreases the bioavailability
by 25 to 50%.[231] reported elimination t1⁄2 values
differ between 0.7 and 2.2 hours.
the pharmacokinetics of captopril in patients
with cardiovascular disease are within the range

reported for healthy individuals,[228] as are the
pharmacokinetics in the aged,[232] unless there is
concomitant moderate to severe renal insufficiency. patients with congestive heart failure have
also shown no difference in mean pharmacokinetic
parameters. however, there is considerable variability in some individuals, making dose titration
necessary.[233]
careful dose reduction is required in patients
with renal impairment, according to the degree of
renal failure.[234] mean clearance of captopril during dialysis ranges from 4.8[235] to 7.2 l/h[236] depending on the dialysis filter employed. elimination of captopril is not affected by reduced liver
function.
captopril should not be used in all 3 trimesters
of pregnancy, because of a high degree of fetal morbidity and even mortality.[237] only about 0.7% of
the captopril serum concentration appears in the
breast milk of lactating women.[238] if the dose can
be kept low, treatment does not pose enough risk
to preclude breast feeding.
effects of captopril in infants with congestive
heart failure are beneficial.[239] age alone is not a
reason to alter dosage schedules. treatment of
chronic heart failure in the very old with a twice
daily 25mg captopril dose is useful.[240] only substantial renal deficits of more than 35% have pharmacokinetic implications.[232]
the most commonly cited adverse effects are
rash, dysgeusia, hypotensive symptoms (dizziness,
vertigo), taste disturbance and proteinuria. cough
appears to be a class-related effect. angioneurotic
oedema and neutropenia are serious adverse effects

which occur rarely. no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions with hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide ( xxxd2167xxx ), procainamide,
allopurinol, antacids, probenecid, cimetidine or
digoxin have been established.[228] concomitant
administration of indomethacin reduces the antihypertensive effect of captopril and antacids reduce its bioavailability.[241]
3.2 enalapril

the indications for enalapril use include hypertension and chronic heart failure. enalapril, like
other ace inhibitors, lowers peripheral vascular
resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.
enalapril is available in 2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg
tablet form. the initial dosage in patients with
normal renal function is 5 mg/day, and 2.5 mg/day
in patients with a creatinine clearance (clcr) less
than 30 ml/min. the dose can be doubled at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks, depending on response, to a
maximum of 40 mg/day.
enalapril was designed as a prodrug to improve
the availability of the active ace inhibitor enalaprilat, which is poorly absorbed.[242] about 60%
of an oral dose of enalapril is absorbed.[243] food
intake does not influence the bioavailability of
enalapril.[244] the ec50 for ace inhibition is 5 to
20 mug/l. the vd is 1.7 l/kg.[245] the initial phase
elimination t1⁄2 is about 5 hours and the prolonged
terminal t1⁄2 is 30 to 35 hours.
enalaprilat is eliminated through the complementary pathways of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.[246] the renal clearance after multiple oral doses of captopril is 4.9 ml/min/kg.[245,247]
data suggest that renal impairment corresponds
with an increase in nonrenal excretion.[248] the
drug can accumulate in patients with moderate to
severe renal impairment. lower doses or less frequent dosing may be indicated in these patients.[248,249] the drug is removed effectively by
haemodialysis.[250]
reversible deterioration of renal function has
been reported in a few patients and is more frequent if hydrochlorothiazide is given concurrently
with enalapril. in patients with hepatic dysfunc© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

tion, conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat may be
delayed. however, hepatic dysfunction due to
compensated liver cirrhosis does not alter biotransformation of the drug in a clinically significant
manner.[251]
there are no studies about safety in pregnant
women. because animal studies have revealed
increased fetal lethality and retarded growth of newborn rats, ace inhibitors should not be employed.[237]
if the dose can be kept low, treatment does not pose
enough risk to preclude breast feeding.
published experience with enalapril is limited
in paediatric practice. so far no significant adverse
effects have been reported.[252] administration
should be restricted to therapy resistant cases. cmax
and auc of enalaprilat are increased in elderly
healthy volunteers compared with young volunteers. however, the only significant difference was
the protein bound amount which, in the elderly,
was approximately half that in the young. as is
often the case, the standard deviation for many of
the pharmacokinetic values in the elderly was
higher than that encountered in the young.[253]
therefore, some dosage adjustment based on clcr
may be necessary in the elderly.[254]
enalapril is well tolerated in the majority of patients. most cited adverse effects are cough (about
10%), tachycardia, palpitations, vertigo, dizziness,
headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, hypotension, angina
and taste disturbances. angioneurotic oedema occurs rarely. no interference with other antihypertensive drugs, digoxin, warfarin, cimetidine or
ibuprofen have been reported. hyperuricaemic
and hypokalaemic properties of thiazide diuretics
are attenuated.[243] combination with potassiumsparing diuretics can provoke hyperkalaemia.
3.3 ramipril

ramipril is an alternative ace inhibitor for use
in patients with hypertension or congestive heart
failure. the drug reduces vascular resistance in
arteriolar and venous capacity vessels by decreasing angiotensin-ii and aldosterone.
ramipril is available in 1.25, 2.5 and 5mg tablet
form. the antihypertensive efficacy of ramipril 5
clin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

472

to 10mg once daily is comparable to a single daily
dose of enalapril 10 to 20mg or captopril 50mg
twice daily.[245] the recommended starting dosage
is 2.5mg once daily. about half of nonresponders
may reach a supine and standing diastolic bp of
90mm hg or less, after addition of either a thiazide
or  xxxd2966xxx  (6mg).
ramipril and ramiprilat are eliminated by both
the liver (one-third) and the kidneys (remainder).[255]
mean cmax is reached in about 1 (ramipril) and 3
hours (ramiprilat).[256] effective plasma concentrations (ec50) for inhibition of ace range from 1 to
10 mug/l. a prolonged terminal excretion phase reflects tight binding of ramiprilat to serum ace
with slow elimination from this site. the t1⁄2 after
once-daily administration ranges from 13 to 17
hours.[257,258] the renal clearance, which for ramiprilat appears to approximate total clearance, is
about 1.1 ml/min/kg.[258] coadministration of food
does not appear to affect the bioavailability of ramiprilat.[259] the binding to human serum proteins is
73% for ramipril and 56% for ramiprilat.[255]
in patients with renal insufficiency cmax and
auc are dependent on clcr.[260,261] dosage reduction is therefore necessary in renal insufficiency. dialysis patients or patients with primary
hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with
ramipril. impaired liver function decelerates metabolism of ramipril, resulting in markedly elevated
plasma concentrations of ramipril. dosage reduction is necessary.
ramipril should not be used during pregnancy.
breast-feeding women should not be treated with
ramipril due to lack of data.
use of ramipril in paediatric practice is not recommended because of lack of experience. when
compared to young volunteers, the mean cmax in
elderly individuals was doubled after ramipril
20mg[262] and increased by about 20% after ramipril 10mg.[263]
adverse effects of ramipril are similar to those
encountered with captopril and enalapril. most frequently reported adverse effects are nausea, dizziness, headache and fatigue. class specific symptoms are cough, rash, gastrointestinal disorders,

hypotension, taste disturbances and angioneurotic
oedema.
interactions are almost identical to those encountered with enalapril.[264,265] potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene) or
potassium supplements increase the risk of hyperkalaemia.
3.4 lisinopril

indications for the use of lisinopril are hypertension and cardiac insufficiency. arterial and venous
vasodilation occur through inhibition of ace. in
one study a 10- to 12-week treatment period with
lisinopril caused a reduction in the left ventricular
muscle mass by 12% in patients with hypertension.[266]
lisinopril is available in 2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg
tablet form. a multicentre study has shown that a
single daily dose of lisinopril is more effective (exercise tests) than an equivalent 3 times daily dose
of captopril.[267]
lisinopril does not possess a sulfhydryl group
and is practically not metabolised:[247,268] 30% is
excreted in urine and 70% in faeces. the mean
renal clearance is 4.2 ml/min/kg.[269] drug intake
during meals does not influence the oral bioavailability of 25%.[268,270] in patients with cardiac insufficiency, the bioavailability of lisinopril is 16%
less than in volunteers.[271] however, the reduced
resorption and bioavailability in these patients is
compensated for by reduced renal clearance.[271,268]
the ec50 for ace inhibition is 27 mug/l. the
effective t1⁄2 in healthy volunteers averages 12 hours
despite a terminal serum t1⁄2 of approximately 40
hours.[268] in patients with renal insufficiency the
t1⁄2 and cmax are dependent on clcr. the t1⁄2 ranges
from 12.7 hours and cmax from 11.8 mug/l with a
clcr above 75 ml/min to a t1⁄2 of 54.3 hours and a
cmax of 48.7 mug/l with a clcr of 10 to 30
ml/min.[272] dose reduction is therefore necessary
in renal insufficiency.[273] dialysis patients or patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not
be treated with lisinopril. chronic hepatitis, caused
by lisinopril, and cholestatic effects have been reported.[274,275]
clin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

vasodilators: part i

lisinopril is contraindicated during pregnancy.
breast-feeding women should not be treated with
lisinopril due to lack of experience.
paediatric use is not advisable because of lack
of data. in the elderly, lisinopril plasma concentrations are higher and renal clearance lower than in
young persons.[269,276]
the most frequently noted adverse effects are
headache, dizziness, fatigue, cough, nausea, rash,
diarrhoea and hypotension. lisinopril is well tolerated in most patients. no pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed between lisinopril and
 xxxd2215xxx  ( xxxd2215xxx ), lovastatin, nifedipine,
propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide or digoxin.[276-280]
3.5  xxxd3063xxx 

indications for the use of  xxxd3063xxx  are essential
hypertension and cardiac insufficiency.[281,282] vascular resistance in arteriolar and venous capacity
vessels is reduced by decreasing angiotensin-ii and
aldosterone.
 xxxd3063xxx  is available in tablets of 5, 10 and
20mg. single daily dosing is as effective as double
daily dosing. at a plasma concentration of 1.5 mug/l
plasma ace is inhibited by 50%.[281]  xxxd3063xxx  is
hydrolysed to the active drug, quinaprilat.[283] the
apparent elimination t1⁄2 is 2.2 hours, the terminal
t1⁄2 is 26 hours. the long terminal t1⁄2 is the result of
slow dissociation of the drug from its target site,
ace,[284] and most correctly mirrors the biological
effectiveness of the drug. accumulation does not
occur.
the renal clearance is approximately 2 ml/min/
kg.[281] a clcr less than 40 ml/min slows the excretion of quinaprilat. therefore, renal insufficiency requires dose adjustment (starting dose
2.5mg), according to the clcr. however, even in
patients with severe renal insufficiency, steadystate is reached within 1 day and accumulation
does not occur.[284]
 xxxd3063xxx  is tolerated in patients maintained on
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.[285,286]
the pharmacokinetic profile in these patients is
similar to that in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. dialysate excretion is negligible. quin© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

april should not be administered during dialysis or
haemofiltration, especially with polyacryl-nitrilmethallylsulfonate-high-flux membranes (risk of
anaphylactic reaction). the plasma concentration
of  xxxd3063xxx  is increased in patients with liver cirrhosis and that of quinaprilat decreased. patients
with primary hepatic disease or insufficiency
should not be treated with  xxxd3063xxx .
 xxxd3063xxx  should not be used during pregnancy.
breast-feeding women should not be treated with
 xxxd3063xxx . paediatric use is also not recommended.
slow hydrolysation, combined with a decrease in
clcr, as encountered in older patients, may lead to
higher quinaprilat concentrations[287] and require
dose reduction.[288] a starting dosage of 5 mg/day
is advised in patients older than 65 years.
the most often reported adverse effects are dizziness, headache, cough, hypotension, fatigue and
exanthema. there were no differences between
younger and older patients.[289] no interactions between  xxxd3063xxx  and digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide,
cimetidine, propranolol or  xxxd2911xxx  have
been reported. the resorption of tetracyline is reduced dose dependently. lithium plasma concentrations increase. the action of alcohol (ethanol) is
more pronounced.
black patients, as a group, do not respond well
to ace inhibitors as monotherapy, though there are
exceptions. when hydrochlorothiazide is added to
the treatment, these patients respond as well as nonblack patients.[290] calcium antagonists are more
likely to be an effective first-line therapy than ace
inhibitors in black patients, patients with high salt
intake, in patients with angina or raynaud’s disease. ace inhibitors are preferred in patients with
low salt intake, in patients with congestive heart
failure and in combination with a diuretic.[291]
4. angiotensin-ii receptor antagonists
from a pharmacodynamic standpoint, the bradykinin potentiating effect of ace inhibitors makes
them ‘combination’ drugs. though some of the
beneficial effects of ace inhibitors may be due to
bradykinin potentiation, some undesirable adverse
effects and hypotension at initiation of treatclin pharmacokinet 1998 jun; 34 (6)

474

kirsten et al.

ment[210] are also attributed to the additional vasodilatory effects of bradykinin. separating angiotensin-ii inhibition from bradykinin potentiation
has been the goal in developing an angiotensin-il
receptor antagonist.[292]
hypertensive agents generally cause reduction
in left ventricular mass, and ace inhibitors have
been shown to be most effective in this regard.[219]
considering that angiotensin-ii exerts a proliferative effect on cardiac tissue,[293] blocking that effect with an angiotensin-ii receptor antagonist such
as losartan should also result in a reduction of left
ventricular mass in hypertensive patients. animal
models have shown this to be the case.[294-296]
whether an angiotensin-ii receptor antagonist is as
effective as ace inhibitors in reducing cardiac
mass remains to be investigated.
a slow bp reduction occurs generally without
initial hypotension[297] after initiation of treatment.
the incidence of undesirable adverse effects is
comparable to that encountered with placebo treatment.[298] salt and/or volume deficiency must be
corrected before initiation of therapy. pharmacokinetic data for losartan, the prototype agent of this
class, are summarised in table v.
4.1 losartan

crozier et al.[298] demonstrated that patients
with chronic heart failure (nyha ii and iii) show
improved haemodynamics after treatment with
losartan (50mg once daily), undiminished after 12
weeks of therapy. the treatment was well tolerated
with infrequent hypotension, and no cough was observed.
losartan should not be used in patients with
primary hyperaldosteronism, in patients with aorta
or mitral valve stenosis or in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. the main action of losar-

tan is blockade of the angiotensin-ii  xxxg100xxx ,
which causes inhibition of vasoconstriction and
decreased synthesis of aldosterone. development
of antagonists against the  xxxg101xxx  receptor subtype,
whose pathophysiological role still has not been
elucidated, is in progress.[299] also, an angiotensinii antagonist which exhibits potent and equal affinity for human at1 and  xxxg101xxx  receptor subtypes has
been discovered.[300]
losartan is available as a 50mg tablet and is
administered once daily for essential hypertension.
food intake does not influence absorption of the
drug. the oral bioavailability of losartan is 33%.
losartan is metabolised to an active oxidative metabolite which has a longer t1⁄2 than losartan.[301]
after oral or iv administration of losartan the conversion to the active metabolite is 14%.[302] the
plasma protein binding for losartan is almost 99%
and the active metabolite is 99.7% bound.[303]
mean cmax is approximately 300 mug/l and the ec50
to decrease mean bp is 32 mug/l.[304] though the
plasma concentration of losartan in women was
twice that found in men, there were no differences
in efficacy and safety.[305,306] the vd is 34l for
losartan and 10l for the active metabolite. the terminal t1⁄2 for losartan is 2 hours, for the active metabolite between 6 and 9 hours.[307]
the excretion is one-third urinary and two-thirds
biliary. the mean plasma clearance of losartan after
iv administration was 8.1 ml/min/kg. the mean
renal clearance was 0.92 ml/min/kg.[302] whereas
renal excretion is only a minor elimination pathway for losartan, 55% of the active metabolite is
renally excreted. though the renal clearance of the
active metabolite also decreases with renal impairment, the steady state auc does not increase with
increasing degrees of renal insufficiency. therefore, dose adjustment is not necessary in patients

with renal insufficiency.[308] losartan is not removed by dialysis. the drug should not be employed in patients with renal artery stenosis (double-sided) or stenosis in a singly occurring kidney
or after transplantation. the active metabolite level
of losartan has been found to be 1.7 times higher
in patients with alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis,
and lack of experience in this patient group prohibits general use.
losartan should not be used during pregnancy,
and breast feeding is a contraindication.
children should not be treated with losartan. pharmacokinetics are not changed in older patients.[309]
serum  xxxd3472xxx  levels have fallen significantly
during losartan treatment in older patients, as has
been observed in healthy volunteers.[310]
vertigo, exanthema, orthostatic dysfunction,
angioneurotic oedema and upper respiratory infections have been reported as adverse effects. dry
cough occurs significantly less often during losartan treatment than during ace inhibitor treatment.[311]
cimetidine increases the bioavailability of losartan but not of the active metabolite.[312] losartan does not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin.[313] potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone,
amiloride, triamterene) or potassium supplement
increase the risk of hyperkalaemia.
