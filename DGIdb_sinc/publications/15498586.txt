abstract evidence has accumulated that some of the  xxxg99xxx   xxxg100xxx  antagonists have insulin-sensitizing property.
we thus examined the eﬀect of  xxxd3303xxx  on insulin action
using 3t3-l1 adipocytes. with standard diﬀerentiation inducers,
a higher dose of  xxxd3303xxx  eﬀectively facilitated diﬀerentiation
of 3t3-l1 preadipocytes. treatment of both diﬀerentiating
adipocytes and fully diﬀerentiated adipocytes with  xxxd3303xxx 
caused a dose-dependent increase in mrna levels for pparc
target genes such as ap2 and adiponectin. by contrast,  xxxd3303xxx  attenuated 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1
mrna level in diﬀerentiated adipocytes. of note, we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that  xxxd3303xxx  augmented glut4
protein expression and 2-deoxy glucose uptake both in basal and
insulin-stimulated state of adipocytes, which may contribute, at
least partly, to its insulin-sensitizing ability.

1. introduction
functional abnormalities in adipocytes have been implicated
in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic
syndrome [1]. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c
(pparc), a nuclear receptor abundantly expressed in adipocytes, plays a pivotal role in adipocyte diﬀerentiation, function
and distribution through regulating a wide variety of target
genes [2]. actually, synthetic ligands for pparc, thiazolidinedione derivatives (tzds), have proven to be eﬀective for the
treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes in humans [3,4].
although tzds such as pioglitazone [5] and rosiglitazone [6]
are widely employed in clinical practice, in some cases, these
compounds cause adverse eﬀects such as ﬂuid retention, peripheral edema and heart failure [7].
a number of clinical trials have suggested that angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or  xxxg99xxx   xxxg100xxx 
antagonists (or  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers, arbs) can

improve insulin sensitivity and signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of newly occurred type 2 diabetes in patients with hypertension [8,9]. however, the mechanism whereby blockade
of renin–angiotensin system enhances whole body insulin
sensitivity has not been fully elucidated so far [10,11]. very
recently, it has been reported that a clinically used arb,  xxxd3303xxx , shares a structural similarity with pioglitazone and
can serve as a partial agonist of pparc [12,13]. the work
demonstrated that  xxxd3303xxx  uniquely augmented the expression of established pparc target genes including ap2
(fabp4), cd36, and acetyl  xxxd1739xxx  carboxylase (acc) in
murine and human adipocytes and murine myocytes [12] as
well as induced adipogenesis in 3t3-l1 preadipocytes [12].
furthermore, data have shown that orally-administered  xxxd3303xxx  improved glucose and lipid homeostasis in rats fed
high-fat and high-carbohydrate diet [12]. however, underlying
mechanism responsible for insulin-sensitizing eﬀects by  xxxd3303xxx  has not been fully addressed. moreover, systemic administration experiments would not be enough to clarify the
exact action site of  xxxd3303xxx  in terms of improvement of fuel
homeostasis.
in this context, the present study was designed to elucidate
the eﬀect of  xxxd3303xxx  on insulin action using 3t3-l1
adipocytes. we here show that  xxxd3303xxx  coordinately regulates mrna expression of insulin-sensitizing hormone,
adiponectin [14,15] and insulin resistance-inducing enzyme,
11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-hsd1) [16,17],
which may favor adipocytes with insulin sensitization. we also
demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that  xxxd3303xxx  augments
glut4 protein expression and 2-deoxy glucose uptake in
3t3-l1 adipocytes, providing evidence that  xxxd3303xxx  exerts
its insulin-sensitizing eﬀects directly on adipocytes.

were purchased from nacalai tesque, inc. (kyoto, japan). dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle’s medium (dmem), calf serum (cs) and fetal bovine serum (fbs) were from invitrogen corp. (carlsbad, ca, usa).
ecl plus western detecting kit was purchased from amersham biosciences corp. (piscataway, nj, usa).
2.2. cell culture and oil red o staining
3t3-l1 cells (kindly provided by dr. h. green and dr. m. morikawa, harvard medical school, boston, ma, usa) were cultured
and diﬀerentiated into adipocytes as described previously [18]. brieﬂy,
cells were grown for 2 days post-conﬂuence (referred as day 0) in 10%
cs/dmem. diﬀerentiation was induced with 10% fbs/dmem containing 0.5 mm ib, 0.25 lm dx and 1 lg/ml insulin for 2 days. the
cells were then incubated in 10% fbs/dmem with insulin for 2 days
and maintained hereafter with 10% fbs/dmem to day 8.  xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx  and pioglitazone were dissolved in dmso and added to
media within 0.1% of volume. medium was changed every other day.
at day 8, the cells were washed with pbs twice, ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h and then stained with 0.6% (w/v) oil red o solution
(60% isopropanol, 40% water) for 2 h at room temperature. cells were
then washed with water to remove unbound dye. stained oil red o
was eluted with isopropanol and quantiﬁed by measuring the optical
absorbance at 510 nm [19].
2.3. northern blot analyses and quantitative real time pcr
during the course of adipose diﬀerentiation, all compounds including dmso (vehicle) were added to media on day 2 (diﬀerentiating
state) or on day 8 (mature adipocyte) for 24 h. although insulin was
added to media from day 2 to day 3, media without insulin were used
in case of extracting rna on day 3. after 24 h incubation, total rna
of 3t3-l1 cells was prepared using trizol reagent (invitrogen). to
determine mouse ap2 and adiponectin mrna expression levels, equal
amount of total rna (20 lg/each lane) was electrophorased, transferred and northern blot hybridization was performed as described
previously [20]. for quantitative rt-pcr assay, cdna was prepared
from total rna using superscript first-strand synthesis system
(invitrogen). to determine 11b-hsd1 mrna levels, these probe and
primers were employed [21]: probe (50 fam-cgtcatctcctccttggctgggaatamra-30 ), forward (50 -agcagagcaatggcagcat-30 ) and reverse (50 gagcaatcataggctgggtca-30 ). taqman pcr was performed using abi
prism 7700 sequence detection system as instructed by manufacturer
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). results were normalized
to endogenous control 18s mrna concentrations.
2.4. western blot analyses
cells were washed twice with ice-cold pbs and harvested in a lysis
buﬀer (10 mm tris–hcl, 1 mm edta, 255 mm sucrose, 1% (v/v)
nonidet p-40, 1 mm pmsf and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin at ph 7.4). after
centrifugation, supernatants were normalized for protein concentration via bradford method and subjected to immunoblotting. western
blot analyses were performed using anti-polyclonal glut4 antibody
(santa cruz biotechnology, california, ca, usa) as reported previously [22].
2.5. 2-deoxy glucose uptake assay
cells were treated with 0.1% dmso,  xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx  or
pioglitazone throughout the course of diﬀerentiation. on day 8, glucose transport by monolayer of 3t3-ll adipocytes was assessed by the
uptake of 2-deoxy-l -[3 h]glucose (perkin elmer life sciences, boston,
ma, usa) as reported previously [20].
2.6. statistical analyses
the data are presented as means  s.e.m. student’s t test was used
to compare the data between the vehicle (dmso) and treated group.
diﬀerences were accepted as signiﬁcant at p < 0:05 level.

3. results
3.1.  xxxd3303xxx  facilitates lipid accumulation in 3t3-l1
adipocytes
to explore the potential eﬀect of  xxxd3303xxx  on adipogenesis, 3t3-l1 preadipocytes were diﬀerentiated with  xxxd3303xxx 
in addition to standard diﬀerentiation inducers (i.e., ib, dx

fig. 1. eﬀect of  xxxd3303xxx  on adipose diﬀerentiation of 3t3-l1 cells.
 xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx  and pioglitazone were dissolved in dmso
(vehicle) and added to media from the start of diﬀerentiation (day 0) to
mature adipocyte (day 8). (a) diﬀerentiated adipocytes were ﬁxed and
stained with oil red o at day 8. macroscopic and microscopic pictures
(magnitude 50) of cells are shown. (b) lipid accumulation was assessed by the quantiﬁcation of od510 in destained oil red o with
isopropanol.  xxxd3303xxx  signiﬁcantly facilitated adipogenesis in a
concentration of 1 lm (17  6% increase) and 10 lm (17  5% increase). data are expressed as means  s.e.m. from triplicate experiments. **p < 0:01 (student’s t test) compared with vehicle (v) treated

and insulin) [18]. as shown in fig. 1, higher doses (1 and 10
lm) of  xxxd3303xxx  facilitated diﬀerentiation of 3t3-l1 cells,
whereas a lower dose (0.1 lm) did not. on the contrary,  xxxd3487xxx  had no eﬀect on adipogenesis even with a concentration
of 10 lm. these data were well in agreement with previous
report [12]. also, consistent with previous reports [23,24],
pioglitazone facilitated the diﬀerentiation of preadipocytes
with a concentration of 1 lm.
3.2.  xxxd3303xxx  regulates a line of pparc target genes
to elucidate regulation of pparc downstream genes by
 xxxd3303xxx  in adipocytes, compounds were added to diﬀerentiation media on day 2 (fig. 2) or on day 8 (fig. 3) for 24 h.
by addition of 10 lm  xxxd3303xxx  from day 2 to day 3 (differentiating state), mrna levels of ap2 and adiponectin were
increased about 2.4  0.1-fold (p < 0:01) and 2.2  0.1-fold
(p < 0:01) compared to vehicle (dmso) treatment, respectively (fig. 2a and b). noteworthy is that such an increase in

analyses of ap2 (a) and adiponectin (b) were performed. quantiﬁcation of relative mrna expression was shown. (c) speciﬁc mrna for

mrna level was in a dose-dependent manner. on the other
hand,  xxxd3487xxx  did not augment mrna expression of ap2
and adiponectin. the level of mrna for 11b-hsd1, which
has been shown to increase by 500-fold during diﬀerentiation
of 3t3-l1 cells [25], was not changed by  xxxd3303xxx ,  xxxd3487xxx 
or pioglitazone (fig. 2c).
when arbs were added to media after cells were diﬀerentiated into adipocytes, ap2 and adiponectin mrna levels were

also elevated only by 10 lm  xxxd3303xxx  (2.2  0.1-fold
(p < 0:01) and 2.1  0.1-fold (p < 0:01), respectively), whereas
 xxxd3487xxx  did not exert such eﬀects (fig. 3a and b). in diﬀerentiated adipocytes, gene expression of 11b-hsd1, known to
be downregulated by pparc ligand [25], was signiﬁcantly
decreased by 10 lm  xxxd3303xxx  (0.6  0.1-fold (p < 0:01)), but
not by  xxxd3487xxx  (fig. 3c).

3.3. eﬀect of  xxxd3303xxx  on 2-deoxy glucose transport in
3t3-l1 adipocytes
to examine a potential impact of  xxxd3303xxx  on glucose
transport in diﬀerentiated 3t3-l1 adipocytes, 2-deoxy glucose
(2-dg) uptake assay was performed. although treatment with
 xxxd3487xxx  did not aﬀect 2-dg uptake even with a concentration of 10 lm,  xxxd3303xxx  signiﬁcantly increased glucose uptake. even in the absence of insulin (fig. 4a), 1 and 10 lm
 xxxd3303xxx  signiﬁcantly augmented 2-dg uptake in adipocytes by 1.9  0.2-fold (p < 0:05) and 3.0  0.2-fold (p < 0:01),
respectively. in the presence of 1 lm insulin (fig. 4b), 1 and 10
lm  xxxd3303xxx  also signiﬁcantly augmented glucose uptake
by 1.7  0.2-fold (p < 0:05) and 2.7  0.5-fold (p < 0:01),
respectively.
3.4.  xxxd3303xxx  increases glut4 protein level in 3t3-l1
adipocytes
based on our result that  xxxd3303xxx  has a robust eﬀect on
glucose uptake, we next assessed its impact on glut4 protein
expression. western blot analyses showed that, when cells were
diﬀerentiated with 1 or 10 lm of  xxxd3303xxx , glut4 protein
was signiﬁcantly increased compared to dmso treatment

fig. 5.  xxxd3303xxx  signiﬁcantly increases glut4 protein expression
in 3t3-l1 adipocytes. cells were treated with compounds throughout
the course of diﬀerentiation. on day 8, total cell lysates were prepared
and equal amount of protein (5 lg) was subjected to western blotting.
quantiﬁcation of relative protein expression was plotted. data are

(1.4  0.1-fold, or 1.3  0.1-fold, p < 0:05, respectively)
(fig. 5). in contrast,  xxxd3487xxx  did not augment glut4 protein expression even with a concentration of 10 lm.

4. discussion

fig. 4.  xxxd3303xxx  increases glucose transport in 3t3-l1 adipocytes.
cells were treated with compounds throughout the course of adipocyte
diﬀerentiation (day 0–day 8). 2-dg uptake was measured in the absence (a) or presence (b) of 1 lm insulin.  xxxd3303xxx  signiﬁcantly
augmented 2-dg uptake in a dose-dependent manner. data are presented as means  s.e.m. from quadruplicate experiments. *p < 0:05,

we here demonstrate that  xxxd3303xxx  dose-dependently
augments glut4 protein expression and 2-deoxy glucose
uptake both in basal and insulin-stimulated state of 3t3-l1
adipocytes. the potency of such insulin-sensitizing eﬀects is
comparable to that seen in pioglitazone-treated cells and is not
observed in cells treated with  xxxd3487xxx . to the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report providing evidence that  xxxd3303xxx  exerts its insulin-sensitizing eﬀects directly on
adipocytes. consistent with our data, previous reports have
shown that tzds augment glut4 protein expression and
glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes [23,24,26,27]. although
several mechanisms are involved in the molecular control of
glut4 expression by tzds [28–30], the result allows us to
speculate that  xxxd3303xxx  induces glut4 expression and
subsequent glucose uptake, at least in part, via pparc activation in adipocytes.
a line of evidence has suggested that the activation of the
renin–angiotensin system impairs early steps of  xxxg1194xxx  signaling such as tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1194xxx  substrate 1 or activation of  xxxg1743xxx -kinase both in vivo and
in vitro [31,32]. on the other hand, it has been shown that
chronic  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonism via clinically employed arb, irbesartan increases muscle glut4 protein
levels in zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats [33]. taken together, it is
tempting to speculate that the blockade of  xxxg99xxx  receptor signaling might exert metabolically beneﬁcial eﬀects in
adipocytes. nevertheless in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic
mouse,  xxxd3487xxx  has been shown to enhance glut4 translocation to plasma membrane [34], no reports have shown that
arbs increase glut4 protein expression and subsequent

496

glucose uptake in adipocytes. in this context, our data provide
evidence that  xxxd3303xxx  is the case.
it has been widely recognized that pparc expressing in
‘‘extra-adipose’’ tissues such as macrophage, colon, liver,
skeletal muscle, pancreatic b cells or pituitary cells is also involved in a line of pathologic conditions including type 2 diabetes, steatosis, atherosclerosis and cancer [35,36]. moreover,
 xxxg99xxx   xxxg100xxx  has been shown to express in a
wide variety of tissues including adipocytes [37–39]. thus, an
entire picture of the in vivo mechanism whereby  xxxd3303xxx 
improves glucose homeostasis must await further investigation. however, our results suggest that adipocytes are one
of the major sites of action for  xxxd3303xxx  in terms of fuel
metabolism.
a growing body of evidence has suggested that pparc
agonists have the strong potential to correct functional abnormalities in adipocytes including amelioration of dysregulation in adipocytokine release (see [1] for review). a prototype
of adipocytokines, adiponectin, has been recognized as a fatcell derived insulin-sensitizing hormone [14,15]. our data
demonstrate that, in both diﬀerentiating and diﬀerentiated
3t3-l1 adipocytes,  xxxd3303xxx  augments mrna expression
of adiponectin in a dose-dependent manner, which may also
contribute to metabolically-beneﬁcial eﬀects of  xxxd3303xxx .
furthermore, the present study demonstrates that, in differentiated adipocytes,  xxxd3303xxx  substantially decreases
mrna level for 11b-hsd1, an intracellular glucocorticoid
reactivating enzyme [16,17]. evidence has accumulated that
locally-enhanced action of glucocorticoid in adipocytes, mediated by exaggerated activation of 11b-hsd1, plays an important role in adipocyte dysfunction and adipocytokine
dysregulation [16,17,40,41]. taken together, it is reasonable to
speculate that  xxxd3303xxx -induced decrease in the mrna level
for 11b-hsd1 favors adipocytes with insulin sensitization. it is
known that gene expression of 11b-hsd1 is markedly induced
( by 500-fold) during the course of adipose diﬀerentiation
[25], which may explain, at least in part, why we failed to
observe the decrease in mrna level for 11b-hsd1 by  xxxd3303xxx  in diﬀerentiating adipocytes.
in summary, the present study ﬁrst provides evidence that
 xxxd3303xxx  enhances glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes,
accompanied by an increase in glut4 expression. coordinated regulation of mrna expressions for adiponectin and
11b-hsd1 in adipocytes may also be beneﬁcial for insulinsensitizing eﬀects by  xxxd3303xxx . our data provide a fresh
insight into improved therapeutic approaches to treat type 2
diabetes, hypertension with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.
