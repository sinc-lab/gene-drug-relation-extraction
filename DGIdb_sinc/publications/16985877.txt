selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators to prevent treatment-related osteoporosis.  the intended therapeutic effect of  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) agonists is hypogonadism, which is a leading cause of osteoporosis in men. consistent with this observation, gnrh agonists decrease bone mineral density and increase fracture risk in men with prostate cancer. gnrh agonists markedly decrease serum levels of both testosterone and estrogen. estrogens play a central role in homeostasis of the normal male skeleton, and the available evidence suggests that estrogen deficiency rather than testosterone deficiency accounts for the adverse skeletal effects of gnrh agonists. the central role of estrogens in male bone metabolism provides a strong rationale to evaluate selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators for prevention of treatment-related osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer. preliminary evidence suggests that both raloxifene and  xxxd3402xxx  increase bone mineral density in gnrh agonist-treated men. an ongoing pivotal study will evaluate the effects of  xxxd3402xxx  on fractures and other complications of gnrh agonists in men with prostate cancer.
