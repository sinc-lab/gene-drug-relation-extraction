abstract
5- xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas), the first enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway, catalyses the pyridoxal 5v-phosphatedependent condensation between glycine and succinyl-coa to yield 5- xxxd148xxx  ( xxxd148xxx ). a three-dimensional
structural model of rhodobacter spheroides alas has been constructed and used to identify amino acid residues at the active site that are
likely to be important for the recognition of glycine, the only amino acid substrate. several residues have been investigated by site-directed
mutagenesis and enzyme variants have been generated that are able to use alanine, serine or threonine. a three-dimensional structure model
of 5- xxxd148xxx  synthase from human erythrocytes (alas 2) has also been constructed and used to map a range of naturally
occurring human mutants that give rise to x-linked sideroblastic anemia. a number of these anemias respond favourably to  xxxd3049xxx 
(pyridoxine) therapy, whereas others are either partially responsive or completely refractory. detailed investigations with selected human
mutants have highlighted the importance of arginine-517 that is implicated in glycine carboxyl group binding.

1. introduction
in animals, fungi and some photosynthetic bacteria, the
heme macrocylic ring is biosynthesised in a pathway comprising eight enzymes [1]. the first of these enzymes, 5aminolevulinic acid synthase (alas) ( xxxg122xxx   xxxg123xxx ), catalyses the reaction between glycine and succinyl-coa to give
the 2- xxxd3471xxx , 5- xxxd148xxx  (for reviews, see
refs. [2,3]). in plants and some bacteria, 5- xxxd148xxx 
acid is generated by an alternative pathway from glutamate
[4], but the other seven reactions from 5- xxxd148xxx 
to heme are thought to be common to all living systems.
alas requires pyridoxal 5v-phosphate for activity and
belongs to a small family of related enzymes that all catalyse
cuc bond formation (or cleavage) between an amino acid
and an acyl-coa substrate with the release of coa and the

formation of an enzyme-bound 2-amino-3-ketoacid intermediate. decarboxylation of this intermediate, followed by
reprotonation, leads to the formation of a 2- xxxd3471xxx 
product that is finally released from the enzyme. other
members of the family include 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
synthase [5], serine  xxxd2832xxx  transferase [6] and 2-amino3- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase [7]. the identification and
sequencing of dna specifying all four of these synthases
has revealed a large number of invariant and conserved
residues, some of which are common to all classes of
pyridoxal 5v-phosphate-dependent enzymes [8]. the role
of several of these residues has been investigated using
recombinant murine alas. for instance, the catalytic
lysine responsible for the covalent attachment of pyridoxal
5v-phosphate has been identified as lysine-313 [9], the
sequence of amino acids from residues 141 – 151 (hgagaggtrni) has been shown to play a key role in cofactor
binding [10] and arginine-439 has been implicated in
glycine carboxyl recognition [11].

the x-ray structures of two of the family of 2- xxxd3471xxx  synthases have been determined, namely, those of 8amino-7-oxononanoate synthase [12] and 2-amino- xxxd64xxx :coa ligase [13]. these enzymes exhibit 33%
identity at the amino acid level but exhibit a remarkable
similarity at the three-dimensional level. of particular
prominence are two histidines that are located on each side
of the pyridoxal 5v-phosphate cofactor and which appear to
be unique to this family of enzymes. several other invariant
residues contribute to a complex hydrogen bonding network
within the active site. other residues near the active site are
conspicuous by their differences within the 2- xxxd3471xxx 
synthase family but are invariant or highly conserved in
each of the individual family members. several of these
residues are thought to be important in determining substrate specificity. for instance, at position 83 (r. spheroides
alas numbering), threonine (or valine) is found in the
enzymes that use glycine as a substrate but this is substituted
by the smaller serine residue in 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
synthase. the nature of the residues at positions 115 and
216 also appear to reflect the size of the amino acid
substrate. when alanine or serine is the substrate, positions
115 and 216 tend to be the less bulky residues, glycine and
alanine, respectively. when a smaller substrate, such as
glycine is involved, these positions are usually occupied
by residues with more bulky side chains such as valine,
cysteine or serine. the first part of this paper discusses the
effects of site-directed mutations at these three positions to
investigate their importance in substrate specificity.
in humans, deficiency of alas leads to a variety of xlinked sideroblastic anemia that has been actively studied
by the research groups of bottomley et al. [14] and may
and bishop [15]. some patients with this inherited disease
respond favourably to  xxxd3049xxx  (pyridoxine) therapy,
whereas other individuals may be only partially responsive
or even completely refractory. to gain more insight into
the structural consequences of human mutations that cause
x-linked sideroblastic anemias, we have constructed a
three-dimensional structure model of human erythroid 5aminolevulinic acid synthase ( xxxg123xxx ) and used it to map
a range of naturally occurring human mutations. in particular, the location of the individual mutation with respect to
the cofactor, pyridoxal 5v-phosphate, has been addressed.
in addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we have
investigated the importance of an invariant arginine-517
(human erythroid numbering) that is proposed to play a
key role in binding the carboxyl group of the amino acid
substrate, glycine.

2. methods
2.1. structure modeling
sequences of enzymes under study were obtained from
the swiss-prot database. the coordinates for the struc-

ture of escherichia coli 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase
were kindly provided by dmitriy alexeev (edinburgh university). the coordinates of e. coli 2-amino  xxxd64xxx 
ligase were obtained from the pdb database i.d. code ifc4.
sequence alignments between 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
synthase and alas and alignments between 2-amino-3oxobutyrate coa ligase and alas were carried out using
the programme clustlw [16]. the initial alas model
based on both 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase and 2amino  xxxd64xxx  ligase structures were generated using
programme modeller 6v2. the initial sequence alignment was adjusted to improve the modeling result and
further rounds of alignment and modeling were carried out
to optimise the model. the final model was subjected to
evaluation by the programme procheck [17].
2.2. isolation and assay of alass
recombinant alas (hema) from rhodobacter spheroides was expressed in e. coli and isolated according to bolt
et al. [18]. the specific activity of the purified enzyme was
13.0 ı̀mol/h/mg protein. mutations were introduced using a
pcr method [19]. human recombinant alas and mutants
were expressed in (his)6 tagged form in e. coli and isolated
according to bottomley [20]. the specific activity of the
purified human recombinant enzyme was 2.4 ı̀mol/h/mg
protein. determination of enzyme activity was carried out
by using a coupled continuous assay in which the substratedependent release of coenzyme-a was monitored by the
formation of nadh using either pyruvate dehydrogenase
[21] or 2- xxxg1627xxx  [22].

3. results and discussion
3.1. substrate specificity studies with alas from r.
spheroides
the model of the r. spheroides 5- xxxd148xxx 
synthase, based on the structures of 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase and 4-amino- xxxd64xxx :coa ligase, is
shown in fig. 1. the position of amino acid residues that are
invariant in all four 2- xxxd3471xxx  synthases are essentially
superimposible; however, it was evident that other residues
in the active site, such as threonine 83, alanine 115 and
valine 216, although highly conserved in all 5- xxxd148xxx  synthases, differed in other members of the family.
these residues are shown in fig. 2.
the fact that in the enzymes that use a larger amino acid
substrate than alas, these residues are more often than not
exchanged for a smaller residue, suggested that they could
play a role in substrate recognition and binding. for
instance, in 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthases, which use
alanine as a substrate, the amino acid at positions 83 and
115 are serine and glycine, respectively. in serine  xxxd2832xxx 
transferase, serine or proline or threonine is found equiv-

fig. 1. three-dimensional structure of the r. spheroides alas dimer. the structure was modeled on two closely related enzymes, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
synthase [12] and 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  ligase [13] as described in methods. for a detailed discussion of the structure, these references should be consulted.

alent to position 83 and glycine is at 115. in alas, where
the substrate is glycine, larger residue is found at position
115. table 1 summarises the amino acids found at the
equivalent positions in all members of this enzyme family.
in alas, positions 118 and 243 may also be involved in a
compensatory way.
to test the possibility that one or more of these residues
had a role in amino acid substrate selection, mutants at each
of these three positions were generated including t83a,
t83s, a115g and v216a as well as the double mutants
a115g/v216a and t83s/a115g. all mutant enzymes were
purified to homogeneity and their properties were investigated by spectroscopic and kinetic analysis.
initial rate determinations with the purified mutant
enzymes revealed that v216a and a115g/v216a had very
low activity (0.07% and 0.01%, respectively) compared

with the activity of the wild-type enzyme. thus, valine must
be essential for reasons of enzyme stability. the a115g
single mutant was 13.6% active and t83a was 10.3%
active. the t83s mutant and the double mutant, t83s/
a115g, were the most interesting because not only did they
possess activity similar or higher to that of the wild type but
were able to use amino acid substrates other than glycine.
for instance, whereas the wild-type enzyme showed a rigid
specificity for glycine (fig. 3a), the t83s mutant preferred
threonine as a substrate but could also use serine, alanine
and glycine (fig. 3b). the t83s/a115g double mutant
preferred serine but was also able to use alanine, threonine
and glycine. there was also an indication from kinetic
analysis (fig. 3b) that product release may be affected
adversely by some of the mutations. despite this broadening
of substrate specificity, larger or polar amino acids such as
glutamate were not accepted as a substrate. interestingly, all
mutants with altered substrate specificity maintained a rigid
stereochemical preference, using only l- and not d-amino
acids (data not shown).

the main conclusion from this work is that residue 83
plays a key role in amino acid substrate recognition. the
situation is not simple, however, because more subtle factors
that probably involve the entire protein structure contribute
to ensuring that only a single amino acid substrate is
selected by the active site.
3.2. modeling the human erythroid alas
a model of human erythroid alas was constructed,
based on the structures of 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase and 4-amino- xxxd64xxx :coa ligase, and is shown
in fig. 4. most of the mutants that lead to x-linked
sideroblastic anemias [14,15,20] have been mapped onto
this model. the mutations all involve invariant or highly
conserved residues and represent all the exons from the
catalytic core of the human erythroid gene (exons 5-11).
3.3. structure – function relationships in mutant human
erythroid alass
one of the most interesting aspects of human mutations
in alas is the observation that some patients with defective enzyme respond to well to  xxxd3049xxx  therapy and, in
some cases, anemia is reversed. other patients are refractory
to pyridoxine therapy, with some showing only a partial
response. the availability of a reliable model for human
erythroid alas has allowed an exploration of any structural basis for the clinical observations with respect to
pyridoxine therapy. it is quite clear that some mutants, such
as those involving substrate binding residues or catalytic
group, would be inactive under all conditions and refractory
to pyridoxine therapy. examples of these are r227c and
r517c. the model shows that arginine-227 forms key
subunit – subunit interaction and that arginine-517 is an
active site residue and likely to be essential for binding
the substrate, glycine, through its carboxyl-group. human
mutations that are only partially responsive to pyridoxine
therapy are more often than not on the periphery of the
enzyme, with the exception of y199h. interestingly, mutations that are located in the vicinity of the pyridoxal 5vphosphate binding site such as m426v, g291s and t388s
exhibit a nearly complete response to pyridoxine therapy. in
some cases (k299q), the response is complete. thus,
whereas, there is no direct relationship between the location
of the mutations and the effect on the enzyme activity, a
trend is evident that mutations near the pyridoxal 5v-phosphate binding are more responsive to pyridoxine therapy.
the results from in vitro experiments also support this
premise.

3.4. the role of arginine-517 in glycine carboxyl group
binding in human erythroid alas
studies on the murine erythroid enzyme have highlighted
the possibility that arginine-517 (human erythroid number-

ing) is responsible for binding the carboxyl group of
glycine. site-directed mutation of the equivalent residue
arginine-439 to several other amino acids in the murine
enzyme removed all enzyme activity with the exception of a
lysine mutant that retained over 50% of the native activity
[11]. significantly, a natural human mutation at the equivalent position in the human erythroid enzyme, r517c, is
completely refractory to pyridoxine therapy [14,15]. to
investigate the importance of arginine-517 in the human
enzyme, mutants r517l and r517k were generated. the
r517c mutant was completely inactive (see also refs.
[14,15]) but the r517k mutant showed 5% activity when
compared to the native enzyme. modeling glycine into the
active site of human erythroid alas (fig. 5) indicates that
when bound through a schiff base to the catalytic lysine, the
guanidino group of arginine-517 is well placed to interact
with the carboxyl group of glycine. the involvement of
arginine-517 in binding glycine explains why the r517c
mutant is inactive in vitro and is refractory to pyridoxine
therapy in vivo.

3.5. conclusions
despite having small crystals of human erythroid alas,
it has not yet been possible to obtain a reliable x-ray data set
and an interim modeling strategy has therefore been adopted. using structures of the closely related enzymes, 8amino-7-oxononanoate synthase and 2-amino- xxxd64xxx 
coa ligase, models of alass from the photosynthetic
bacterium r. spheroides and from the human erythroid
system have been generated. the bacterial model has been
used to identify residues that may specify amino acid
substrate recognition. mutagenesis of threonine 83 to serine
has produced a mutant in which the specificity of the
enzyme to glycine has been severely compromised, with
threonine becoming the best substrate. however, the mutant
was unable to recognise threonine as its sole substrate and
showed broader substrate tolerance. the double mutant
t83s/a115g was more active than the wild type but again
lacked specificity. the human erythroid enzyme model was
used to map the mutations that result in x-linked side-

roblastic anemia and to explore the molecular basis for
pyridoxine responsiveness. a trend was observed that
patients with mutations in the vicinity of the cofactor binding site appear to be more responsive to pyridoxine, as long
as the residue involved is not an essential catalytic group.
the role of pyridoxal 5v-phosphate is likely to be one of
stabilizators of the enzyme where the affinity of the cofactor
is reduced by the mutator. the findings in these experiments
suggest that both models are reliable and make a useful
additional source of information for investigating structure –
function relationships in the enzyme.
