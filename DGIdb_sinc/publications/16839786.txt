a procedure for inducing sustained hyperlipemia in rats by administration of a surfactant.   xxxd3458xxx  ( xxxd3458xxx ) is a non-ionic detergent that inhibits  xxxg1337xxx  and thereby raises levels of serum lipids. it is used frequently for acute studies on lipids in rats but not for subacute or chronic studies. in the present work, we found that  xxxd3458xxx  must be injected intravenously three times each week in order to have high and sustained levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides for 1, 2, or 3 weeks. these results make it possible to extend the use of  xxxd3458xxx  into chronic studies of hyperlipemia and vascular disease.
