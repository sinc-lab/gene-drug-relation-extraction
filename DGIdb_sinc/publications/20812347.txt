background: chondrosarcoma represents the second most common primary malignant bone tumor causing significant morbidity due to local
recurrence and limited treatment options. conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has been proven to be largely ineffective to this sarcoma. here we
report that sorafenib is effective in growth inhibition of chondrosarcoma cell lines in vitro.
methods: chondrosarcoma cell lines (sw1353 and crl7891) were treated with sorafenib. flow cytometry, dapi assay, and western blotting
were employed to determine the effects of sorafenib in inhibitory proliferation and induce apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells in vitro.
results: the results showed that sorafenib effectively inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells, which was concurrent
with inhibition of the expression of phospho-mek and phospho-erk. further more the expression levels of  xxxg366xxx , rb and anti-apoptotic
proteins  xxxg251xxx  and  xxxg1388xxx  significantly reduced, but no changes in bcl-2 and bax. we although detected the expression of akt, jnk, p38 and their
respective phosphoprotein, but did not found meaningful changes.
conclusions: our findings demonstrate that sorafenib inhibited the ras/ xxxg268xxx   xxxg1924xxx /mapk pathway in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in
chondrosarcoma cell lines sw1353 and crl7891 and suggest that sorafenib may be a new therapeutic option for patients with chondrosarcoma.

introduction

materials and methods

chondrosarcoma, as the second most common spindle cell sarcoma
of bone, represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that are
characterized by the formation of cartilage matrix [1]. majority of
these tumors grow slowly and are resistant to conventional chemo- and
radiotherapy. wide surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment
for localized diseases [2]. the clinical challenges of these localized
tumors are to prevent recurrence and to find better treatment options
for unresectable or metastatic diseases [3]. however, the treatment
of advanced, metastatic disease is particularly challenging given the
recognition that conventional chemotherapy has been proven to be
largely ineffective.
recent accumulating evidence suggests that the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) pathway is often up-regulated in cancer cells
and represents an attractive target for development of anti-cancer
drugs [4]. mapks, as the important regulators, play important
roles in apoptosis and proliferation and dysregulation of the mapk
pathway is associated with tumor development and progression [5].
the up-regulation of mapk pathway has been proved taking part
in migration and collagen production of chondrosarcoma [6–8]. so
down-regulation of mapk pathway may be appropriate alternate
therapy for chondrosarcoma patients.
sorafenib (nexavar,  xxxd3226xxx ) is a small molecule, multikinase inhibitor that has been previously shown to inhibit  xxxg268xxx   xxxg1924xxx /mek/
erk pathway [9]. subsequent molecular studies suggest that sorafenib
is also a potent inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including
 xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1710xxx , and  xxxg802xxx  [10]. there is evidence show that
sorafenib inhibit tumor proliferation in tumor cell lines and several
human tumor xenograft models [11,12]; however, the anti-tumor effect
of sorafenib on chondrosarcoma has not been studied so far. in this
investigation, we studied the induction apoptosis and inhibition of cell
proliferation of sorafenib on chondrosarcoma cell lines sw1353 and
crl7891 in vitro through the  xxxg268xxx   xxxg1924xxx /mek/erk pathway.

technologies, chantilly, va). the cell viability was expressed as the
percentage of absorbance in cells with sorafenib treatment versus
the control group. results were expressed as means  sd values of
triplicates derived from at least three independent experiments.

apoptosis analysis by flow cytometer
apoptotic cells were measured with  xxxg166xxx /fitc kit (bd
biosciences, sparks, md) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. after compound treatment, cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry. there were 1  106 cells collected, then washed with 48c
precooling pbs two times, and then the cells were resuspended in
500 ml of binding buffer. five microliters of  xxxg166xxx -fitc solution
and 10 ml pi (1 mg/ml) were added to these cells at 378c for 30 min
away from the light. using flow cytometry to detect apoptosis through
channels two and three, ten thousand cells were examined for
determination.

dapi assay
cells with morphological changes indicative of cell death by
apoptosis were identified and quantified by fluorescence microscopy
after staining with 40,6-diamidino-2-pheny-lindole (dapi). apoptotic
nuclei were identified by condensed chromatin as well as nuclear
fragmentation.

western blotting
cells were plated 24 hr before treatment. then sorafenib were added
at the given concentrations, and after 24 hr cells were washed with cold
pbs and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris–hcl,
ph 7.4, 2 mm edta, 1% np-40) containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(amresco, solon, oh). lysates were then incubated at 48c for 20 min
and centrifuged 20 min at 12,000g/min. protein concentrations were
quantified using the bca assay. equal amounts of total protein (30–
40 mg per lane) were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels by standard
 xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–
page), equal amounts of total protein (30–50 mg per lane) were
resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels by using standard sds–page
techniques, then transferred onto a pvdf membrane (0.45 mm,

results
sorafenib inhibits chondrosarcoma cell proliferation
in order to investigate the effect of sorafenib on inhibition of
proliferation of chondrosarcoma, we exposed sw1353 and crl7891
cells to drug from 1 to 15 mm for 24 hr. mtt assays demonstrated that
sorafenib exerted a dose- and time-dependent cell growth inhibition of
sw1353 and crl7891 cells. the dose–response curves are shown
in figure 1a. the average ic50s for sorafenib of sw1353 and
crl7891 were 5.302 and 4.124 mm, respectively. then the timedependent cell proliferation inhibition of sorafenib on sw1353 and
crl7891 cells were shown in figure 1b. cells were treated with drug
of 5 mm for 24 hr and cell viability reduced 47.2  3.4% and 55.3 
4.2%, respectively.

sorafenib down-regulation of  xxxg366xxx  and
rb in chondrosarcoma cells
 xxxg366xxx  proto-oncogene is an important regulator of g1 to sphase transition and an important cofactor for several transcription
factors in numerous cell types [13,14]. rb is a tumor suppressor protein
that plays important roles in the checkpoint of cell cycle [15]. in order
to determine whether sorafenib inhibited the expression of cyclin
d1 and rb in chondrosarcoma cell lines, we treated sw1353 and

crl7891 cells with 0, 1, 5, 10 mm sorafenib for 12 hr. both of the two
proteins showed significant dose-dependent reduction, as confirmed by
western blotting analysis (fig. 2).

sorafenib causes strongly apoptotic death in ss cells
in our assay, apoptosis was detected by facs analysis using
 xxxg166xxx  and pi. as shown in figure 3, the four quadrants in each
panel correspond, respectively, to: necrotic cells (upper left), apoptotic
late cells (upper right), apoptotic early cells (lower right), viable
cells (lower left). ten hours after treatment with sorafenib, the
results confirmed a dose-dependent apoptotic effect of sorafenib on
chondrosarcoma cells.
further dapi staining confirmed that sorafenib induced a dosedependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells, as shown in
figure 4. cells were treated with 0, 1, 5, 10 mm drug for 24 hr then
nuclei of the cells were stained with dapi. the control cells exhibited
intact nuclei, but sorafenib-treated cells showed significant nuclear
fragmentation, which is a typical marker of apoptosis. the induction of
apoptotic cell death was accompanied by characteristic morphological
and structural changes, including a condensed and fragmented nuclear
structure and decreased cell size.

sorafenib inhibits mapk signaling pathway in
chondrosarcoma cells
to correlate growth inhibition and apoptotic induction with
sorafenib therapy, we examined the expression of mapk pathway
by western blotting. for these studies, the chondrosarcoma cell
lines were treated with 0, 1, 5, 10 mm for 12 hr and examined
the inhibition of the phosphorylation of these proteins. the results
of western blotting showed that sorafenib inhibited p-mek and p-erk
dose-dependently (fig. 5), whereas it had no significant effect on the
phosphorylation of akt, jnk, and p38 (fig. 6).

effect of sorafenib on the expression of pro-apoptotic
protein bax, anti-apoptotic proteins
bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx , and  xxxg1388xxx 
it has been reported previously that sorafenib down-regulates  xxxg1388xxx 
by proteasome-mediated degradation [16], thus we studied whether
sorafenib has similar effects in chondrosarcoma cell lines. because cell
death is regulated by the balance between pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways, we also detected the pro-apoptotic protein bax
and anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx . as shown in figure 7,
after treated with sorafenib for 12 hr, there were no changes on
expression of bcl-2 or bax. however there were significant inhibition
of  xxxg251xxx  and  xxxg1388xxx .

discussion
chondrosarcoma is the second most common spindle cell sarcoma
of bone. majority of these tumors display a poor response to
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. wide surgical resection, as the
mainstay of treatment for localized disease, has received excellent
local control. however unresectable or metastatic disease remains the
primary problem limiting survival [2]. thus new treatment methods are
needed.
in this study, we firstly investigated the mapk signaling pathway of
chondrosarcoma after sorafenib treatment. the mapk signal transduction pathway has been attributed to many oncogenic disorders.
mapks include extracellular signal-regulating kinase (erk), p38
mapk, and  xxxg1222xxx  n-terminal protein kinase (jnk). and these kinases
play important roles in cell differentiation, growth and development.
so targeted these pathways can have remarkable effects [17–19].
sorafenib (nexavar,  xxxd3226xxx ), a potent oral inhibitor of
mapk pathway, was effective in the treatment of a variety of human
cancers [11,12]. and we have studied the effect of sorafenib on
synovial sarcoma [20]. in this article we showed the results from
in vitro studies of sorafenib on chondrosarcoma.

fig. 5. sorafenib inhibits  xxxg268xxx   xxxg1924xxx /mek/erk signaling in sw1353 (a) and crl7891 (b) cells. cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of sorafenib for 12 hr.
our experiments indicated that chondrosarcoma cells were
sensitive to sorafenib in vitro. as shown in our studies, sorafenib
inhibited the ras/ xxxg268xxx   xxxg1924xxx /mapk pathway in a dose-dependent fashion
in chondrosarcoma cell lines sw1353 and crl7891. this appeared
to be due to the down-regulation of p-mek and p-erk, and inhibition
of  xxxg366xxx  and rb. however, our results indicated that sorafenib
had no significant effects on the expression of p-akt, p-jnk, and
p-p38.
as the mapk signal pathway implicated in the cell proliferation,
apoptosis and survival, we tested effects of sorafenib on chondrosarcoma cells’ proliferation and apoptosis. the effect of sorafenib on
the inhibition of proliferation was measured by mtt assay. and the
results proved that, in vitro, sorafenib inhibited the growth of
chondrosarcoma cell lines sw1353 and crl7891 in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. to observe the effect of sorafenib on the
induction of cell apoptosis, we performed the apoptosis analysis by
flow cytometer and dapi assay. cell apoptosis analysis revealed that

after treatment with sorafenib, both sw1353 and crl7891 cells
revealed concentration-dependent apoptosis.
as the cell death was determined by the pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins, we detected the bcl-2 protein family, which played
a central role in the control of apoptosis [21], in sw1353 and crl7891
cells after sorafenib treatment. in our study, there were no significant
changes in the expression of bax and bcl-2 proteins after treatment
sw1353 and crl7891 cells with sorafenib for 24 hr in vitro. however
there were dose-dependent down-regulation of  xxxg251xxx  and  xxxg1388xxx 
proteins, which confirmed our previous report [20]. these results
suggested that sorafenib induced apoptosis in human chondrosarcoma
cell lines sw1353 and crl7891 through the down-regulating of proapoptotic proteins  xxxg251xxx  and  xxxg1388xxx .
in conclusion, we demonstrated that sorafenib was an effective
potential chemotherapeutic agent for the inhibition proliferation
and induction apoptosis of chondrosarcoma cells. although further
research is needed to determine the molecular changes that occur

fig. 7. sorafenib down-regulates  xxxg1388xxx  and  xxxg251xxx  levels in sw1353 (a) and crl7891 (b) cells, but has little effect on expression of bcl-2 or
bax. b-actin was used as an internal control.
outside of the mapk pathway, the effectiveness of sorafenib on
chondrosarcoma cells in vitro was associated with the down-regulation
of the  xxxg268xxx   xxxg1924xxx /mek/erk pathway. thus, in this article we proved that
sorafenib, as the mapk kinase inhibitor, had effective anti-tumor
activity to chondrosarcoma cells in vitro. and these results made
sorafenib a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of patients
with chondrosarcoma.
