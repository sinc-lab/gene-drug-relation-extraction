the aminoacylase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of  xxxd68xxx  (nac) was identified
as  xxxg59xxx  i after purification by column chromatography and electrophoretic analysis. rat
kidney cytosol was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the proteins were
separated by ion-exchange column chromatography, gel-filtration column chromatography, and
hydrophobic interaction column chromatography.  xxxg59xxx  activity with nac and n-acetyl-lmethionine (nam), a known substrate for  xxxg59xxx  i, as substrates coeluted during all
chromatographic steps.  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed
that the protein was purified to near homogeneity and had  xxxg220xxx  mr of 43 000, which is
identical with the mr of  xxxg59xxx  i from porcine kidney and bovine liver. n-butylmalonic acid
was a slow-binding inhibitor of  xxxg59xxx  i and inhibited the deacetylation of nac with a ki of
192 ( 27 µm. these results show that  xxxg59xxx  i catalyzes the deacetylation of nac. the
 xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of a range of s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines, their carbon and
oxygen analogues, and the selenium analogue of nam was also studied with porcine kidney
 xxxg59xxx  i. the specific activity of the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of these substrates
was related to their calculated molar volumes and log p values. the s-alkyl-n-acetyl-lcysteines with short (c0-c3) and unbranched s-alkyl substituents were good  xxxg59xxx  i
substrates, whereas the s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines with long (>c3) and branched s-alkyl
substituents were poor  xxxg59xxx  i substrates. the carbon and oxygen analogues of s-methyln- xxxd68xxx  and the carbon analogue of s-ethyl- xxxd68xxx  were poor  xxxg59xxx 
i substrates, whereas the selenium analogue of nam was a good  xxxg59xxx  i substrate.

introduction
 xxxg2020xxx  is an antioxidant with chemopreventive and
therapeutic effects and is used clinically for the management of acetaminophen toxicity (1, 2) and congestive and
obstructive lung disorders (3, 4). nac may act directly
as an antioxidant (5) or may serve as a l-cysteine prodrug
and, thereby, support glutathione synthesis (1). although nac has been proposed for the therapy of hiv-1
infections (6), treatment of patients with aids with nac
failed to increase glutathione concentrations in plasma
or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (7). nac is
deacetylated in isolated hepatocytes and supports glutathione synthesis in these cells (8). also, human endothelial cells, rat lung, intestinal, and liver homogenates, and human liver homogenates catalyze the
deacetylation of nac (9, 10).
the deacylation of n-acyl-l-amino acids is catalyzed
by aminoacylases (for a review, see ref 11). several

aminoacylases have been identified:  xxxg59xxx  i ( xxxg59xxx ,
n-acylamino acid hydrolase),  xxxg201xxx  (ec 3.5.1.15,
n-acetyl- xxxd233xxx  amidohydrolase), acyllysine  xxxg59xxx 
(ec 3.5.17, n-acetyl-l-lysine amidohydrolase), and  xxxg60xxx .  xxxg59xxx  i shows a preference for aliphatic
n-acyl-r-amino acids.  xxxg201xxx  and acyllysine
 xxxg59xxx  are selective for n-acetyl- xxxd233xxx  and nacetyl-l-lysine, respectively.  xxxg60xxx  shows a preference for n-acyl aromatic amino acids (12).
 xxxg59xxx  i is well-characterized. renal  xxxg59xxx  i is a
zinc-containing, homodimeric protein with  xxxg220xxx  mr
of 43 000 (13). human and porcine cdnas encoding the
complete amino acid sequence of  xxxg59xxx  i have been
reported (14-16).  xxxg60xxx  has not been studied in
detail. a rat liver deacetylase with a substrate selectivity
similar to that of  xxxg60xxx  has been reported (17).
acylases i and iii may catalyze the observed hydrolysis
of xenobiotic-derived mercapturates (s-substituted-nacetyl-l-cysteines) in vivo in rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs
and by rabbit, rat, and guinea pig kidney and liver tissue
extracts (18). the mercapturates of several haloalkenederived, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and mutagenic cysteine
s-conjugates are deacetylated in vivo in rats and by rat
kidney cytosol and isolated renal proximal-tubular cells
(19-21).
the present experiments were designed to identify and
characterize the aminoacylase that catalyzes the deacetylation of nac and to study the effects of substrate

structure on  xxxg59xxx  i activity. an enzyme purified from
rat kidney, which was the rat ortholog of pig kidney
 xxxg59xxx  i, catalyzed the deacetylation of nac and nam.
studies on the effects of increasing both the chain length
and the degree of branching of the s-alkyl substituent
as well as replacement of sulfur with oxygen, carbon, or
selenium showed that enzyme activity was related to the
calculated molar volumes and log p values of the substrates. finally, the  xxxg59xxx -catalyzed deacetylation of
haloalkene-derived mercapturates of nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and mutagenic cysteine s-conjugates was studied.

enzyme purification. kidneys from male sprague-dawley rats (pel-freeze, rogers, ar) were homogenized in 50 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) at 4 °c. all purification
steps were performed at 4 °c. the homogenate was centrifuged
at 9000g, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100000g to
obtain the cytosolic fraction. solid ammonium sulfate was
added to the cytosol to 50% saturation, and the mixture was
stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 9000g for 25 min. the
precipitated proteins were dissolved in a minimum volume of
10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and dialyzed
against the same buffer for 24 h. the dialyzed protein solution
was concentrated to 32 ml in an amicon ultrafiltration cell and
applied to a deae-cellulose column (5.0 × 32 cm; express iond, whatman, hillsboro, or) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the column was eluted with 700
ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and then
with a linear gradient of 10-200 mm potassium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4). eluate fractions (8.2 ml) were collected and
assayed for protein concentrations and enzyme activities. fractions with the highest activity were combined and concentrated
in an amicon ultrafiltration cell, and 42 ml of the concentrated
fraction was applied to a sephacryl s-200 hr (5.0 × 40 cm;
pharmacia, piscataway, nj) column equilibrated with 10 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4); the column was eluted
with the same buffer. eluate fractions (4 ml) were collected
and assayed for protein concentrations and enzyme activities.
fractions with the highest activities were combined and concentrated in an amicon ultrafiltration cell, and 5 ml of the
concentrated fraction was applied to a phenyl-sepharose column
[1.5 × 8 cm; phenyl sepharose 6 fast flow (low substitution),
pharmacia, piscataway, nj] equilibrated with 50 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) containing 1.7 m (nh4)2so4. proteins
were eluted first with three column volumes of the column
equilibration buffer and then with three column volumes of 50
mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0). eluate fractions (1
ml) were collected and assayed for protein concentrations and
enzyme activities and were analyzed by sds-page (10%
acrylamide). proteins were visualized by coomassie blue staining. the purified  xxxg59xxx  was stored at 4 °c for 1 month without
significant loss of  xxxg59xxx  activity. protein concentrations were
determined by the method of bradford (34) with bovine serum
albumin as the standard.
activity assays.  xxxg59xxx  i activity was determined by
measuring the formation of deacetylated l-amino acids. lmethionine formed by the deacetylation of nam was determined
by reaction with fluorescamine (35). the reaction mixture (1

ml) contained 0.1-0.5 ml of protein solution and 2 µmol of
substrate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the
reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °c for 1 h, and the reaction
was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 20% trichloroacetic
acid. the mixture was allowed to stand for 10 min in an ice
bath and then centrifuged (500g, 10 min). a sample (40 µl) of
the supernatant was added to 3.6 ml of 50 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), and the volume was brought to 4
ml by the addition of water. fluorescamine (300 µl of a
solution containing 10 mg of fluorescamine dissolved in 33 ml
of acetone) was added to the sample, and the fluorescence
intensity (390-nm excitation, 475-nm emission) was measured
immediately with a perkin-elmer ls-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer (norwalk, ct). a standard curve was prepared with
 xxxd2595xxx .
l-cysteine formed by the deacetylation of nac was determined by reaction with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (36).
(the thiol groups in l-cysteine and nac interfered with the
fluorescamine assay.) the deacetylation reaction was performed
as described for nam. a sample (200 µl) of the supernatant
was added to 2.8 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph
7.4). 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (0.5 ml of a 0.07%
solution in the assay buffer) was added to the sample, and the
mixture was incubated at 50 °c for 30 min. the reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the absorbance
at 420 nm was measured with a perkin-elmer lambda 3a
spectrophotometer (norwalk, ct).
 xxxg59xxx  i activity with nac, nam, s-methyl-, s-ethyl-, s-npropyl-, s-isopropyl-, s-n-butyl-, s-isobutyl-, and s-tert-butyln-acetyl-l-cysteines, n-acetyl- xxxd2756xxx , n-acetyll- xxxd2755xxx , n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx , o-methyln-acetyl-dl-serine, s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx ,
s-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx , and s-(2bromo-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx  was determined
with commercially available porcine kidney  xxxg59xxx  i. the
reaction mixtures contained 3.5 units of  xxxg59xxx  i and 4 µmol
of substrate in a final volume of 1 ml of 50 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the reaction mixtures containing
nac, nam, s-methyl-, s-ethyl-, and s-n-propyl-n-acetyl-lcysteines, n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx , s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx , s-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-nacetyl-l-cysteine, and s-(2-bromo-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-n-acetyll-cysteine were incubated for 30 min at 37 °c, and the reaction
mixtures containing s-isopropyl-, s-n-butyl-, s-isobutyl-, and
s-tert-butyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines, n-acetyl-l-2-aminopentanoic
acid, n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx , and o-methyl-n-acetyldl-serine were incubated for 1 h at 37 °c. the amounts of
l-amino acids formed were measured as described above.
kinetic analyses. the kinetics of the deacetylation of nac,
nam, s-methyl-, s-ethyl-, and s-n-propyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines,
and n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx  was studied with commercially
available porcine kidney  xxxg59xxx  i. for the determination of
the km and vmax, the reaction mixtures contained 3.5 units of
 xxxg59xxx  i and 1.0-16.0 mm substrate in a final volume of 1 ml
of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the reaction
mixtures were incubated at 37 °c for 10 min, and the amounts
of l-amino acids formed were measured as described above.
experiments were performed in triplicate. the km and vmax
were computed by fitting the data to the michaelis-menten
equation with the ez-fit program (perrella scientific, inc.,
conyers, ga).
the inhibition of the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of nac
by n-butylmalonic acid was also studied. the reaction mixtures
contained 53 units of pig kidney  xxxg59xxx  i, 2 mm nac, and 0,
0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mm n-butylmalonic acid in 5 ml of 50 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4); reactions were started by
addition of enzyme. the reaction mixtures were incubated at
37 °c, and 50-µl samples were withdrawn at 3-min intervals
and added to 2.95 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer
(ph 7.4). the amount of l-cysteine formed was quantified as
described above. experiments were performed in triplicate. ki
values were determined from the progress curves as described

 xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed hydrolysis of n-acetyl-l-cysteines

chem. res. toxicol., vol. 11, no. 7, 1998 803

by morrison et al. (37). the progress curves were fitted to a
one-step mechanism for reversible, slow-binding inhibition,
which is described by the equation: p ) vst + (vo - vs)(1 e-kt)/k. kinetic constants were computed by the ez-fit program.
the inhibition of the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of nam
by the sulfur-lacking analogue n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx 
was also studied. the reaction mixtures (1 ml) contained nam
(1-10 mm), 3.5 units of pig kidney  xxxg59xxx  i, and 1, 2, 4, or 6
mm n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx  in 50 mm potassium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) and were incubated at 37 °c for 20
min. the amounts of  xxxd2595xxx  formed were measured as
described earlier. experiments were performed in triplicate.
the data were analyzed by the ez-fit program.
calculations. the log p and molar refractivity (cmr) were
calculated as described by hansch and leo (38). the molar
volumes were calculated as molar refractivity, which is a sum

s-isopropyl- xxxd68xxx  ≈ s-isobutyl-n-acetyl-lcysteine. no deacetylation of s-tert-butyl-n-acetyl-lcysteine was detected. the  xxxg59xxx  i specific activities
with nam and s-ethyl- xxxd68xxx  were similar.
 xxxg59xxx  i activity with n-acetyl-l-2-aminopentanoic
acid and o-methyl-n-acetyl-dl-serine, the carbon and

oxygen analogues of s-methyl- xxxd68xxx , was
lower than with s-methyl- xxxd68xxx . no deacetylation of the n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx , the carbon
analogue of s-ethyl- xxxd68xxx , was detected.
furthermore, n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx  inhibited
the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of nam with a ki
of 2.02 ( 0.33 mm. the analysis of the inhibition data
showed that n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx  was a
competitive inhibitor of the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of nam (data not shown). also,  xxxg59xxx  i activity
with n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx , the selenium analogue
of nam, was lower than with nam.
a plot of  xxxg59xxx  i specific activity against calculated
molar volumes (figure 4a) showed that the hydrolysis
of s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines with straight-chain salkyl substituents increased with increasing molar volume (nac < s-methyl- xxxd68xxx  < s-ethyl-nacetyl-l-cysteine) and then decreased with further
increases in molar volumes (s-n-propyl- xxxd68xxx  > s-n-butyl- xxxd68xxx ). for the s-alkyln-acetyl-l-cysteines with branched-chain s-alkyl substituents,  xxxg59xxx  i activity decreased with increases in
the degree of branching of the side chain, even though
the substrates with branched-chain s-alkyl substituents
had identical calculated molar volumes as their straightchain analogues. thus, s-n-propyl- xxxd68xxx 
and s-isopropyl- xxxd68xxx  had identical calculated molar volumes, but  xxxg59xxx  i activity with sisopropyl- xxxd68xxx  was lower than activity
with s-n-propyl- xxxd68xxx . similarly, s-n-butyl- xxxd68xxx , s-isobutyl- xxxd68xxx , and
s-tert-butyl- xxxd68xxx  had identical calculated
molar volumes, but  xxxg59xxx  i activity with s-isobutyl-nacetyl-l-cysteine was lower than with s-n-butyl-n-acetyll-cysteine; activity with s-tert-butyl- xxxd68xxx 
was not detected.  xxxg59xxx  i activity with o-methyl-nacetyl-dl-serine, n-acetyl- xxxd2756xxx , and
n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx  was lower than with
sulfur-containing analogues even though their calculated
molar volumes were lower.
a plot of  xxxg59xxx  i specific activity against calculated
log p values showed a trend similar to that observed with
calculated molar volumes of s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines
with unbranched s-alkyl substituents (figure 5a). sisopropyl- xxxd68xxx , s-isobutyl- xxxd68xxx , and s-tert-butyl- xxxd68xxx  had lower log
p values than their corresponding unbranched analogues,
but their rates of deacetylation were also lower.  xxxg59xxx 
i activity with o-methyl-n-acetyl-dl-serine and n-acetyll-2-aminopentanoic acid was lower than with the sulfurcontaining analogue even though their calculated log p
values were lower and higher, respectively. also,  xxxg59xxx 
i activity with n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx  was lower
than with sulfur-containing analogue even though its
calculated log p value was higher.

inhibition at substrate concentrations > 4 mm.

discussion
these results demonstrate that the deacetylation of
nac is catalyzed by  xxxg59xxx  i. the enzyme catalyzing
the deacetylation of nac that was purified from rat
kidney was similar to  xxxg59xxx  i from porcine kidney (39)
and bovine liver (40): both  xxxg59xxx  i and the enzyme
isolated in the present study had  xxxg220xxx  mr of
approximately 43 000, and both enzymes catalyzed the
hydrolysis of nac and nam. the km and vmax for the
deacetylation of nac were 4.4 mm and 44.7 µmol/mg of
protein/min, respectively. with nam as the substrate,
a km of 2 mm has been reported for  xxxg59xxx  i (39).
n-butylmalonic acid is a transition-state analogue of
 xxxg59xxx  i substrates and is a slow-binding inhibitor of

 xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed hydrolysis of n-acetyl-l-cysteines

the porcine kidney  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of
nam (41). n-butylmalonic acid was also a slow-binding
inhibitor of the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of nac.
although the catalytic activities ascribed to  xxxg59xxx  i
are well-known, the physiological role of  xxxg59xxx  i is
poorly understood. it has been proposed that  xxxg59xxx  i
may participate in the salvage of n-acetylated amino
acids (40, 42).  xxxg59xxx  i also catalyzes the hydrolysis of
some n-acyl dipeptides (43). the activity of  xxxg59xxx  i
with a range of n-acyl-l-amino acids has been studied,
and it has been shown that the electronegativity of the
acyl group has a prominent effect on  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed
deacetylation reactions (44, 45).
the present studies show that the length and degree
of branching of the n-acyl-l-amino acid side chain also
have prominent effects on  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation reactions. s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines with short
(c0-c3) and unbranched s-alkyl substituents were good
 xxxg59xxx  i substrates, whereas the s-alkyl-n-acetyl-lcysteines with long (>c3) and branched s-alkyl substituents were poor  xxxg59xxx  i substrates. the effect of chain
length and degree of branching of the s-alkyl substituent
on  xxxg59xxx  i activity were related to calculated molar
volumes. the data show that for substrates with unbranched s-alkyl substituents with chain lengths of c0c3,  xxxg59xxx  i activity increased with increasing calculated
molar volumes and then decreased with increasing
calculated molar volumes for substrates with chain
lengths >c3. the s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines with
branched s-alkyl substituents were poor  xxxg59xxx  i substrates irrespective of their calculated molar volumes.
the relationship between  xxxg59xxx  i activity and calculated molar volumes indicates that the substrate binding
site may be a relatively short and narrow pocket that
cannot accommodate branched s-alkyl substituents and
larger calculated molar volumes (chain length > c3). a
similar relationship between  xxxg59xxx  i activity and
calculated molar volumes was not observed with n-acetyll-2-aminopentanoic acid, o-methyl-n-acetyl-dl-serine,
and n-acetyl- xxxd2755xxx , which were poor
 xxxg59xxx  i substrates even though their calculated molar
volumes were lower than those of the corresponding
sulfur analogues. the observation that n-acetyl-l-2aminohexanoic acid is a competitive inhibitor of the
 xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of nam indicates that
it binds to the enzyme but is not deacetylated by  xxxg59xxx 
i. n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx , the selenium analogue
of nam, has a slightly higher calculated molar volume
than nam and was a fairly good  xxxg59xxx  i substrate.
thus, the presence of sulfur or selenium in the side chain
of the n-acetyl-l-amino acid facilitates  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed
deacetylations.
the  xxxg59xxx  i specific activity was also related to
calculated log p values. the relationship between  xxxg59xxx  i specific activity and log p for nac and the s-alkyln-acetyl-l-cysteines with unbranched s-alkyl substituents was similar to that observed with  xxxg59xxx  i specific
activity and calculated molar volumes. the s-alkyl-nacetyl-l-cysteines with branched s-alkyl substituents,
s-isopropyl- xxxd68xxx , s-isobutyl-n-acetyl-lcysteine, and s-tert-butyl- xxxd68xxx , had lower
log p values than their corresponding unbranched analogues but were poorer  xxxg59xxx  i susbtrates. furthermore, o-methyl-n-acetyl-dl-serine and n-acetyl-l-2aminopentanoic acid had lower and higher log p values,
respectively, than the corresponding sulfur analogues but

chem. res. toxicol., vol. 11, no. 7, 1998 807

were poorer  xxxg59xxx  i susbstrates. also, n-acetyl-l-2aminohexanoic acid had a higher log p value than its
corresponding sulfur analogue but was a poorer  xxxg59xxx 
i substrate. it should be noted, however, that the log p
values were calculated for un-ionized substrates, but
ionization of the substrate is essential for binding
(46, 47).
the in vivo and in vitro deacetylation of mercapturates
of nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and mutagenic cysteine sconjugates has been observed (19, 21), but the role of
 xxxg59xxx  i in these reactions has not been established. the
 xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of mercapturates affords cysteine s-conjugates that may undergo beta-lyasedependent bioactivation (20, 32). the present study
shows that s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx , s-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx ,
and s-(2-bromo-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx 
were substrates for  xxxg59xxx  i. indeed, the specific activity
of the  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation of these haloalkene-derived  xxxd68xxx  s-conjugates was higher
than that of halogen-lacking s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines.
the calculated molar volume of s-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx  was similar to that of s-ethyln- xxxd68xxx  and n-acetyl- xxxd2595xxx , but its
rate of deacetylation was about 5-fold higher. also, the
calculated molar volume of s-(2-bromo-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)- xxxd68xxx  was similar to that of s-isobutyl- and s-tert-butyl- xxxd68xxx , but its rate of
deacetylation was about 30-fold higher than that of
s-isobutyl- xxxd68xxx  and s-tert-butyl-n-acetyll-cysteine did not undergo deacetylation. furthermore,
the calculated log p values of the haloalkene-derived
 xxxd68xxx  s-conjugates were considerably higher
than the log p values of the s-alkyl-n-acetyl-l-cysteines,
although within the series their rates of deacetylation
decreased with increasing log p values. the relationship
between  xxxg59xxx  i specific activity and log p values for
the haloalkene-derived n-acetyl-l-cysteines indicates
that hydrophobicity may be important for substrate
binding, but the results obtained in the present study
need to be extended to establish a relationship between
calculated molar volumes or log p values and rates of
deacetylation. these results also indicate that  xxxg59xxx  i
plays an important role in the beta-lyase-dependent bioactivation of haloalkenes and, therefore, contributes to the
conjugation-dependent toxicity of haloalkenes.
although these results indicate a relationship between
 xxxg59xxx  i activity and calculated molar volumes, more
data are needed determine whether calculated molar
volumes may be used to predict  xxxg59xxx  i activity with
n-acyl-l-amino acids. also, the finding that  xxxg59xxx  i
catalyzes the deacetylation of nac combined with the
knowledge that the electronegativity of the acyl group
has a prominent effect on  xxxg59xxx  i-catalyzed deacetylation reactions may be exploited for the design of more
effective l-cysteine prodrugs. immunohistochemical studies show that  xxxg59xxx  i is localized in the proximal tubule
of the kidney (48). this selective localization of  xxxg59xxx 
i may be used to target l-cysteine prodrugs to that region
of the kidney. thus, additional structure-activity studies are warranted that may lead to the design of n-acyll-cysteines that may be targeted for delivery of l-cysteine
to specific tissues at effective rates.
finally, the finding that  xxxg59xxx  i catalyzes the deacetylation of n-acetylseleno- xxxd2595xxx  indicates that the
n-acetyl derivatives of the se-substituted-selenocysteine

808 chem. res. toxicol., vol. 11, no. 7, 1998

conjugates may also be deacetylated by  xxxg59xxx  i and that
structure-activity relationships similar to those observed
with the s-substituted-n-acetyl-l-cysteines may be observed. se-substituted-selenocysteine conjugates have
been proposed as potential prodrugs to target antitumor
agents to the kidney (49), and the cytotoxicity of several
se-substituted-selenocysteine conjugates has been studied (50). further studies are warranted to study the
targeting and efficacy of se-substituted-n-acetylselenocysteine conjugates as potential antitumor agents.
