tribute to hemostasis by regulating the assembly of clotting
and fibrinolytic proteases (1). in addition to negatively charged
phospholipids (1), this process is contributed by a variety of
structurally and evolutionarily unrelated cell surface receptors. these include receptors for  xxxg1847xxx / xxxg1847xxx  (2), fibrinolytic protein urokinase (3), and coagulation zymogens/proteases thrombin (4), factors viia (5),
xii (6), ix/ixa (7), x (8), and xa (9). protease receptors are also
potent signaling molecules, regulating the generation of second
messengers (10, 11), gene transcription and cytokine release
(12, 13), cell proliferation (6, 14 –16), and inflammatory (17) or
anti-inflammatory responses (18).
effector cell protease receptor-1 ( xxxg264xxx )1 functions as a receptor for  xxxg741xxx  on leukocytes (9) and endothelial cells (19),
thus enhancing factor v/va-independent prothrombin activation and leukocyte costimulation (17). on activated platelets,
 xxxg264xxx - xxxg741xxx  interaction contributes to membrane assembly of the  xxxg741xxx  complex (20). for the procoagulant
potential of  xxxg741xxx  in vivo (21) and its mitogenic activity on
endothelium and smooth muscle cells (15, 16),  xxxg741xxx -cellular interactions may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of
vascular injury (22).
in this study, we sought to investigate the structure-function
requirements of  xxxg264xxx - xxxg741xxx  interaction and the receptor
specificity for the active protease versus the zymogen  xxxg741xxx .
using synthetic peptides, a recombinant  xxxg752xxx /x chimera,
and a sequence-specific antibody, we found that the interconnecting egf sequence leu83-phe84-thr85-arg86-lys87-leu88(gly) in  xxxg741xxx  mediates ligand binding to  xxxg264xxx  and becomes surface exposed only after zymogen activation.
experimental procedures

proteins and protein labeling—the experimental procedures for the
isolation and characterization of human plasma factors ix and x and
the generation of the corresponding active proteases ixa and xa have
been reported (8). aliquots of  xxxg741xxx  purchased from calbiochem or
haematologic technologies inc. (essex junction, vt) gave indistinguishable results in binding assays and thrombin generation experiments. dansyl-glu-gly-arg (degr)-chlomethylketone  xxxg741xxx  and
human prothrombin were purchased from haematologic technologies
and calbiochem, respectively.  xxxg741xxx  active site inhibitors tap and
nap5 (23), and napc2, which recognizes a  xxxg741xxx  exosite involved in
zymogen activation by  xxxg748xxx -factor viia, were generously provided by dr. g. vlasuk (corvas international, san diego, ca). a library

binding of  xxxg741xxx  to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) is contributed by effector cell protease receptor-1 ( xxxg264xxx ). the structural requirements of
this recognition were investigated.  xxxg741xxx  or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) glu-gly-arg-(degr)-chloromethylketone- xxxg741xxx  bound indistinguishably to huvec and
 xxxg264xxx  transfectants, and inhibited equally well the
binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx  to these cells. similarly, factor
xa active site inhibitors tap or nap5 did not reduce
ligand binding to  xxxg264xxx . a  xxxg741xxx  peptide duplicating
the inter-egf sequence leu83-phe84-thr85-arg86-lys87leu 88 -(gly) inhibited factor v/va-independent prothrombin activation by huvec and blocked binding of
125
i- xxxg741xxx  to these cells in a dose-dependent manner
(ic50 ; 20 – 40 mm). in contrast, none of the other  xxxg741xxx 
peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-egf
sequence in scrambled order was effective. a recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the  xxxg741xxx  sequence leu83-leu88 within a  xxxg752xxx  backbone inhibited binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx  to huvec and  xxxg264xxx 
transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant  xxxg752xxx  or plasma ixa had no effect. an antibody generated against the  xxxg741xxx  peptide 83– 88, and
designated jc15, inhibited 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding to
huvec. the jc15 antibody bound to  xxxg741xxx  and the
recombinant ix/x83– 88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors x or ixa was observed. furthermore, binding of
125
i- xxxg741xxx  to immobilized jc15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled  xxxg741xxx , but not by comparable
concentrations of factors x or ixa. these findings identify the inter-egf sequence leu83-leu88 in  xxxg741xxx  as a
novel recognition site for  xxxg264xxx , and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope.
this interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of  xxxg741xxx  to cellular assembly of coagulation and
vascular injury.

 xxxg741xxx  cell binding site

gla analysis of recombinant proteins—analysis of  xxxd1246xxx  content (gla analysis) was performed essentially as described by price (32). ten mg of protein were subjected to alkaline
hydrolysis in 2 m koh for 20 h at 110 °c. hydrolyzed amino acids were
titrated to a ph of 7.0 with perchloric acid and centrifuged to remove
precipitate. supernatants were separated by high performance liquid
chromatography on a dc-4a cation exchange resin column (dionex,
sunnyvale, ca) using an elution buffer of lithium citrate, ph 2.0. amino
acids were detected by post-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde buffer and quantitated by fluorescence spectrophotometry (excitation wavelength 340 nm, 418 nm cut-off filter) using a recording
integrator. purified  xxxd1246xxx  and  xxxd233xxx  (sigma)
were used as standards, and samples were compared with a control
sample (plasma-derived  xxxg741xxx , enzyme research labs, south bend,
in). moles of purified protein were determined from the aspartate/
asparagine peak. determinations were performed in duplicate, and
results are reported as an average.
binding studies—huvec were isolated by collagenase treatment
and maintained in dmem tissue culture medium (biowhittaker), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and  xxxg786xxx , plated onto gelatinized 48-well tissue culture
plates (costar corp., cambridge, ma) at a density of 4 3 104 cells/well,
and cultured for 2– 4 d prior to the assay. cells were washed twice with
serum-free rpmi 1640 and incubated in a total volume of 300 ml with
2.5 mm cacl2 and 10.8 nm 125i- xxxg741xxx  in the presence or in the
absence of increasing concentrations (0.1–1 mm) of unlabeled competitors, factors xa, ixa, or degr-xa. for competition experiments with
recombinant  xxxg752xxx  or the ix/x83– 88 chimera, 5.43 nm 125i- xxxg741xxx 
was used. after a 15-min incubation at 22 °c, cells were washed three
times in serum-free medium and solubilized in 10% sds, and radioactivity associated with the cell monolayer under the various conditions
tested was determined in a g counter. in parallel experiments, cho
cells transiently transfected with the  xxxg264xxx  cdna (29) were detached
by phosphate-buffered saline-edta, ph 7.4, washed, diluted to 2.0 3
106/ml in serum-free rpmi 1640 medium, and mixed in a total volume
of 300 ml with 10.8 nm 125i- xxxg741xxx  in the presence or in the absence
of the various competitors, as described above. after a 15-min incubation at 22 °c, cell surface-bound radioactivity was separated from free
by centrifugation of 200-ml aliquots of each incubation reaction through
a mixture of silicone oil (dow corning, new bedford, ma) at 14,000 3
g for 5 min and counted in a g counter. in another series of experiments,
10.8 nm aliquots of 125i- xxxg741xxx  were preincubated with increasing
concentrations (1–500 nm) of the  xxxg741xxx -specific inhibitors tap (23),
nap5, or napc2 for 15 min at 22 °c, before addition to huvec or
 xxxg264xxx  transfectants and determination of specific binding, as described
above. for antibody neutralization experiments, 10.8 nm aliquots of
125
i- xxxg741xxx  were preincubated with increasing concentrations of control non immune rabbit igg (zymed laboratories, san francisco, ca) or
sequence-specific jc15 antibody (see below), for 15 min at 22 °c before
addition to huvec monolayers and determination of specific binding.
for all experiments nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of
a 100 –150-fold molar excess of unlabeled  xxxg741xxx  added at the start of
the incubation and was subtracted from the total to calculate net
specific binding (29). for peptide inhibition experiments, increasing
concentrations (0.1–500 mm) of the various  xxxg741xxx -derived peptides or
their variants (24) were preincubated with huvec monolayers in
serum-free rpmi 1640 medium for 20 min at 22 °c before addition of
10.8 nm 125i- xxxg741xxx  and determination of specific binding, as described above.
thrombin generation—huvec monolayers in 96-well plates were
preincubated in a total volume of 100 ml of serum-free rpmi 1640 with
100 mm concentrations of the various  xxxg741xxx -derived synthetic peptides for 20 min at 22 °c. cells were mixed with 138 mm prothrombin,
1.2 mm cacl2, and 43 nm  xxxg741xxx  for 5 min at 22 °c. thrombin
generation under the various conditions tested was quantitated by
hydrolysis of the thrombin-sensitive chromogenic substrate s-2238
(chromogenix, molndal, sweden) at a405 (29) and converted to thrombin concentrations (nanomolar) using a standard curve constructed
with serial increasing concentrations of bovine thrombin. in another
series of experiments, stable  xxxg264xxx  transfectants or huvec were
mixed with increasing concentrations (0.1–200 mm) of the  xxxg741xxx -derived peptides 83– 88, its control scrambled variant, or the -cooh
terminus egf peptide (gly)-his101-glu102-glu103-gln104-asn105-ser106val107-val108-(gly), for 20 min at 22 °c, before addition of  xxxg741xxx  (43
nm) and prothrombin (138 nm), and determination of s-2238 hydrolysis.
background hydrolysis of s-2238 in the absence of prothrombin (8 –
14%) was subtracted to calculate specific thrombin cleavage (29). the
suboptimal concentration of prothrombin of 138 nm used in these ex-

phe-thr-(gly)-arg-leu-leu (residues in parentheses added to the natural sequence), was synthesized and characterized previously (24).
 xxxg741xxx  numbering was according to fung et al. (25). aliquots (2.1–5.4
mm) of  xxxg741xxx  or degr- xxxg741xxx  were radiolabeled with 125i-na
(amersham corp.) by the iodo-gen method (26) to a specific activity
of 0.4 –1 mci/mg of protein, with separation of free from protein-bound
radioactivity by gel filtration on a sephadex g-25 column pre-equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline, ph 7.4, and collection of 0.5 ml
fractions. both unlabeled  xxxg741xxx  and 125i- xxxg741xxx  indistinguishably
cleaved the  xxxg741xxx -sensitive chromogenic substrate s-2222.
construction of a recombinant  xxxg752xxx /x83– 88 chimera—a recombinant chimeric  xxxg752xxx /x molecule was genetically engineered in
which the interconnecting egf sequence leu-asp-val-thr of  xxxg752xxx 
was exchanged for the corresponding region in  xxxg741xxx  (25), containing
the sequence leu-phe-thr-arg-lys-leu. preliminary experiments demonstrated that  xxxg752xxx  or ixa did not inhibit binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx 
to  xxxg264xxx  transfectants, thus demonstrating the suitability of  xxxg752xxx 
as an unrelated frame to characterize  xxxg264xxx  ligand recognition. the
cdna encoding the  xxxg752xxx /x 83– 88 chimera was produced by overlapping polymerase chain reaction using vent dna polymerase (new
england biolabs, beverly, ma), as described previously (27), using the
full-length sequence of human  xxxg752xxx  in the pcmv5 vector (28) as a
template. in a first round of amplification, two dna fragments were
generated by polymerase chain reaction, one containing the nucleotide
sequence of the  xxxg741xxx  83– 88 peptide at the 39 end (452 base pairs),
and a second one containing the same sequence at the 59 end (539 base
pairs). the two fragments were annealed at the overlapping site corresponding to the  xxxg741xxx  sequence 83– 88, and used as a template for a
second round of amplification. the resulting polymerase chain reaction
product of 973 base pairs was digested with bglii and mlui and directionally subcloned into the pcmv5 vector, containing the  xxxg752xxx 
sequence. the correct insertion of the  xxxg741xxx  83– 88 sequence into the
 xxxg752xxx  framework was confirmed by dna sequencing.
transfection experiments and purification of recombinant coagulation proteins—subconfluent cultures of chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells were transfected with 15 mg of an  xxxg264xxx  cdna clone in the
mammalian cell expression vector pcdna3 (invitrogen, san diego, ca)
by electroporation, as described elsewhere (29). after a 48-h culture at
37 °c, cells were washed, suspended in serum-free dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (dmem) (biowhittaker, walkersville, md) to a final
concentration of 5 3 106/ml, and analyzed for 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding or
factor v/va-independent prothrombin activation (29), as described below. clonal cho cells stably transfected with the  xxxg264xxx  cdna in
prc/cmv were characterized previously (9). for production of chimeric
coagulation proteins, human embryonic kidney 293 cells (american
type culture collection, rockville, md) were grown in dmem (biowhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. six mg of
pcmv5 vector containing the wild-type  xxxg752xxx  cdna or the factor
ix/x83– 88 chimera cdna and 0.6 mg of psv2-neo were used to cotransfect subconfluent cultures of 293 cells, using a lipofectamine
reagent (life technologies, inc.). after a 48-h culture at 37 °c, cells
were diluted 1:10 and 1:20 and grown in 1:1 ratio of dmem and f-12
tissue culture medium in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx ,
life technologies, inc.). two weeks later, the surviving colonies were
transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates, grown to confluency at
37 °c, and screened for  xxxg752xxx  expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously (30). a single clone expressing
high levels of recombinant protein was expanded into roller bottles for
large scale production of recombinant  xxxg752xxx  in dmem-f-12 medium, supplemented with insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite and 6
mg/ml  xxxd3522xxx , with collection of the conditioned medium every 24 h.
for purification of recombinant  xxxg752xxx  or the  xxxg752xxx /x83– 88 chimera, conditioned medium from the various cultures was filtered
through a 0.22-mm sterile filter (millipore corp.) to remove cellular
debris, diluted in buffer containing 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.2, 5 mm
 xxxd302xxx , 5 mm edta, and applied to a q-sepharose column (pharmacia biotech, inc.). after washes in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.2, 60 mm
nacl, and 1 mm  xxxd302xxx , bound proteins were eluted in 20 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.2, 700 mm nacl, 1 mm  xxxd302xxx . the eluted material was then applied to a second column containing the  xxxg752xxx 
conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody a-7 (31). the affinity matrix was washed in 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl, and 20 mm
mgcl2, before elution of recombinant wild-type  xxxg752xxx  or the factor
ix/x83– 88 chimera with 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl, and 20
mm edta. purity of the eluted material was assessed by sds-gel
electrophoresis followed by silver staining. both recombinant  xxxg752xxx 
and the  xxxg752xxx /x83– 88 chimera were tested in competition experiments of 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding to  xxxg264xxx -expressing cells.

catalytic active site-independent binding of  xxxg741xxx  to
 xxxg264xxx —previous studies demonstrated that  xxxg264xxx  bound  xxxg741xxx  but not the zymogen  xxxg741xxx  (9). a potential requirement of  xxxg741xxx  proteolytic activity in ligand binding to
 xxxg264xxx  was investigated.  xxxg741xxx  active site inhibitors tap,
nap5 (23), or napc2, did not reduce 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding to
huvec or  xxxg264xxx  transfectants (table i). similarly, catalytically inactive degr- xxxg741xxx  inhibited binding of 125i-factor
xa to huvec (19) in a concentration-dependent reaction,
quantitatively indistinguishable from that observed with the
active protease (fig. 1a). consistent with these data, 125idegr- xxxg741xxx  bound specifically to huvec, in a reaction
inhibited equally well by increasing molar excess of  xxxg741xxx  or

synthetic peptidyl mimicry of the  xxxg264xxx  binding site on
 xxxg741xxx —screening of  xxxg741xxx  sequences (24) revealed that
a synthetic peptide corresponding to the inter-egf region
leu83-phe84-thr85-arg86-lys87-leu88-(gly) inhibited huvec
prothrombin activation in the absence of factor v/va by ;80%
(fig. 2). with the exception of the  xxxg741xxx  sequence 366 –375,
which produced only a partial and variable reduction in
huvec prothrombin activation, none of the other  xxxg741xxx 
peptides tested, including antagonists of  xxxg741xxx  binding to
mac-1 (24), were effective under the same experimental conditions (fig. 2). a potential mimicry of  xxxg264xxx - xxxg741xxx  interaction by the inter-egf sequence leu83-leu88 was investigated.
increasing concentrations of the  xxxg741xxx  peptide 83– 88 inhibited prothrombin activation on huvec (fig. 3a) or  xxxg264xxx 
transfectants (not shown) in a concentration-dependent manner with ic50 ; 20 – 40 mm (fig. 3a). in contrast, a control
peptide with the 83– 88 sequence in scrambled order kft(g)rll, or the  xxxg741xxx  -cooh terminus egf sequence (gly)his101-glu102-glu103-gln104-asn105-ser106-val107-val108-(gly),

periments is nonsaturating for the system, and has been used for
comparison with previous data obtained with other epr-11 cells (9). no
specific thrombin generation was detected in the absence of cells, under
the same experimental conditions (not shown).
production and characterization of sequence-specific jc15 antibody—a sequence-specific antibody was generated in a rabbit by multiple subcutaneous injections in complete freund’s adjuvant of 100 mg
of the inter-egf  xxxg741xxx  peptide lftrkl(g) preparatively coupled to
keyhole limpet hemocyanin. after a 4-week interval, animals were
boosted with subcutaneous injection of 100 mg of peptide in incomplete
freund’s adjuvant and sequentially boosted and bled at alternate
weeks. rabbit immunoglobulin fractions of the relevant serum, designated jc15, were purified by affinity chromatography on protein asepharose and used for inhibition of 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding to epr-1expressing cells, as described above. the recognition specificity of jc15
antibody was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
ninety-six well plastic microtiter plates (costar corp., cambridge, ma)
were coated with 0.21 mm factors ixa, x, and xa, or the ix/x83– 88
chimera in tris-buffered saline (tbs), ph 7.4, in a total volume of 100
ml for 18 h at 4 °c. after washes in tbs, ph 7.4, wells were post-coated
with 3% gelatin (sigma) in tbs, ph 7.4, for 60 min at 37 °c, and mixed
with increasing concentrations (1.25–50 mg/ml) of control non immune
rabbit igg or jc15 antibody in tbs, ph 7.4, containing 0.05% tween-20
plus 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma) for 90 min at 37 °c. after
washes, binding of the primary antibody was revealed by addition of a
1:4000 dilution of biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg (zymed) for 1 h
at 37 °c followed by washes in tbs, ph 7.4, and addition of a 1:1000
dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin reagent
(zymed) and  xxxd2822xxx  for 30 min at 37 °c, with determination of absorbance at a405. in another series of experiments, 96well plastic microtiter plates were coated with 50 mg/ml aliquots of jc15
antibody in tbs, ph 7.4. after washes and post-coating with 3% gelatin, wells were further incubated with 5.4 nm 125i- xxxg741xxx  in the
presence or in the absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled
factors x, xa, or ixa. after a 45 min incubation at 37 °c, wells were
washed in tbs, ph 7.4, and extracted in 10% sds, and radioactivity
was determined in a g counter.

sistent with the requirement of  xxxg264xxx - xxxg741xxx  interaction
for prothrombin activation (29), binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx  to
huvec was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the
 xxxg741xxx  peptide 83– 88, but not by the 83– 88 control scrambled
peptide, nor by the -cooh terminus egf peptide 101–108
(fig. 3b). the higher peptide concentrations required to inhibit
 xxxg741xxx -huvec interaction as compared with prothrombin
activation (fig. 3) suggests heterogeneity in ligand binding,
potentially comprising both functional ( xxxg264xxx -mediated) and
nonfunctional cellular associations. in control experiments, increasing concentrations (1–200 mm) of  xxxg741xxx  peptides 83– 88
or 101–108 did not reduce  xxxg741xxx - or thrombin-dependent
hydrolysis of s-2222 and s-2238, respectively, ruling out a
potential substrate competition mechanism for inhibition of
cell prothrombin activation (not shown).
molecular characterization of the  xxxg264xxx  ligand binding
site—a recombinant chimeric molecule containing the  xxxg741xxx 
inter-egf sequence 83– 88 was engineered into the framework
of  xxxg752xxx , purified by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography, and tested in gain-of-function experiments for inhibition of 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding to  xxxg264xxx -expressing cells. gla
analysis of the  xxxg752xxx /x83– 88 chimera showed a gla content
similar to that of control plasma-derived protein (9.1 mol of
gla/mol of protein for the recombinant chimeric protein and 7.9
mol of gla/mol of protein for plasma-derived  xxxg741xxx ). under
these experimental conditions, binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx  to
huvec (fig. 4a) or  xxxg264xxx  transfectants (fig. 4b) was dosedependently inhibited by increasing molar excess of unlabeled
 xxxg752xxx /x83– 88 chimera, in a reaction quantitatively indistinguishable from that observed with unlabeled  xxxg741xxx  (fig.
4). in contrast, comparable concentrations of unlabeled recombinant  xxxg752xxx , or plasma-derived ixa, did not decrease binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx  to  xxxg264xxx -expressing cells (fig. 4). in another series of experiments, a sequence-specific antibody,
designated jc15, was generated against the  xxxg741xxx  peptide
83– 88 and tested for inhibition of  xxxg264xxx - xxxg741xxx  interaction.
as shown in fig. 5, preincubation of 125i- xxxg741xxx  with jc15
antibody resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of ligand bind-

bound to immobilized  xxxg741xxx  or the recombinant ix/x83– 88
chimera in a concentration-dependent fashion, while no specific
reactivity with factor ixa or the zymogen  xxxg741xxx  was observed, under the same experimental conditions (fig. 6a). in
control experiments, comparable concentrations of non immune rabbit igg did not bind to immobilized  xxxg741xxx  (fig.
6a). second, binding of 125i- xxxg741xxx  to immobilized jc15 was
competitively inhibited by molar excess of  xxxg741xxx  in a
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 6b), while comparable
doses of factor ixa or the zymogen  xxxg741xxx  did not significantly
reduce 125i- xxxg741xxx  binding to jc15-coated plates (fig. 6b).

 xxxg264xxx . this conclusion was based on synthetic peptidyl mimicry, gain-of-function of a recombinant  xxxg752xxx /x chimera, and
neutralization experiments with a sequence-specific antibody.
moreover,  xxxg264xxx  ligand binding could be recapitulated by catalytically inactive  xxxg741xxx , thus ruling out a potential requirement of local proteolysis for receptor recognition. finally, competition studies with the sequence-specific jc15 antibody
suggested that the inter-egf 83– 88 region was not accessible
in the zymogen  xxxg741xxx , but became surface-exposed in the
active protease.
binding of  xxxg741xxx  to  xxxg264xxx  is one of several receptormediated associations between coagulation/fibrinolytic proteases and vascular cells (2– 4, 6, 33, 34). in addition to the
paradigm of protease-activated receptors (4, 33), these interactions can also be mediated by specific structural requirements,
as exemplified by the receptor-binding sequences in the egflike modules of urokinase (35), and factor xii (6). our observations propose an unexpected role for the short inter-egf
sequence 83– 88 in mediating docking of  xxxg741xxx  to  xxxg264xxx  and
imparting specificity for ligand binding, at least with two different mechanisms. first, the unique structural features of this

inter-egf region, with two unique charged residues lys86 and
arg87, and its high degree of flexibility (36), as opposed to its
“locked” conformation in factor ixa (37), could determine the
ability of  xxxg264xxx  to bind  xxxg741xxx , but not an homologous
protease, i.e. factor ixa. secondly, the accessibility of this interacting motif in  xxxg741xxx  but not in  xxxg741xxx  could dictate the
selective recognition of  xxxg264xxx  for the active protease, and not
for the zymogen  xxxg741xxx .
the idea that zymogen activation may result in conformational changes with exposure of selective neo-antigenic
epitopes has been proposed earlier. keyt et al. (38) proposed
that  xxxg741xxx  activation resulted in conformational transitions
in the heavy chain, as well as metal ion-dependent transitions
in the heavy and light chains. conformational remodeling of
the protease domain upon  xxxg741xxx  activation was also demonstrated by persson et al. (39) using domain-specific f(ab9)2 and
 xxxg741xxx -derived tryptic fragments. similar observations were
reported for factors ixab and x upon ca21 binding to the gla
module (40, 41). our competition experiments with the jc15
antibody provide evidence for an additional activation-dependent conformational transition in the light chain of  xxxg741xxx ,
specifically targeted to the inter-egf 83– 88 sequence. alternatively, this domain may become physically unmasked by the
release of the  xxxg741xxx  activation peptide during zymogen activation (1). interestingly, the  xxxg752xxx /x83– 88 chimera inhibited ligand binding to  xxxg264xxx  without requiring zymogen activation. the ability of the jc15 antibody to recognize this
recombinant protein indistinguishably from native  xxxg741xxx 
suggested that the chimeric insertion produced per se conformational changes and surface exposure of the inter-egf
region.
current experimental evidence demonstrates that protease
receptors initiate multiple cellular signaling pathways. factor
xa, in particular, has been implicated in endothelial, vascular
smooth muscle cell, and leukocyte activation and proliferation
mechanisms (15–17), of potential relevance for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and vascular diseases (22). although the
data presented here identify the inter-egf sequence in factor
xa as mediating ligand binding to huvec, additional requirements may be involved in post-receptor occupancy events of

incubation at 22 °c as described in fig. 1. one hundred percent 125ifactor xa-specific binding was 0.23 6 0.05 nm. data are the mean 6 s.e.

downstream signal transduction events and effector responses
(19).
in summary, we have identified the inter-egf peptide in
 xxxg741xxx  as a novel, activation-dependent sequence for receptor-mediated assembly of coagulation on vascular cells. antagonists with similar specificity may be beneficial at targeting
 xxxg741xxx -dependent cellular effector functions in vascular injury and atherosclerosis (21, 22).

data suggest a cooperative model of  xxxg741xxx  binding to vascular cell  xxxg264xxx , potentially involving an initial gla-dependent
contact stabilized by an high affinity recognition of the interegf sequence 83– 88, and followed by an as yet unidentified
step of local proteolysis by cell surface-bound  xxxg741xxx  for
