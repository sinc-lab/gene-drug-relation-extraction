the potential of  xxxd142xxx : from cytoprotectant to therapeutic agent.   xxxd142xxx  is an inorganic thiophosphate cytoprotective agent known chemically as ethanethiol, 2-&#91;(3-aminopropyl)amino&#93;dihydrogen phosphate. it is a pro-drug of free thiol that may act as a scavenger of free radicals generated in tissues exposed to cytotoxic drugs, and binds to reactive metabolites of such drugs.  xxxd142xxx  was originally developed as a radioprotective agent in a classified nuclear warfare project. following declassification of the project it was evaluated as a cytoprotective agent against toxicity of the alkylating drugs and cisplatin. in fact, pretreatment with  xxxd142xxx  was well tolerated and reduced the cumulative hematologic, renal and neurological toxicity associated with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and vinblastine therapy of advanced and metastatic solid tumors. the objective of this review is to focus the importance of  xxxd142xxx  as a myeloprotective and cytoprotective drug during treatment with chemotherapeutics, presenting the most recent results, and to discuss the application of  xxxd142xxx  in the therapy of myelodysplastic syndromes.
