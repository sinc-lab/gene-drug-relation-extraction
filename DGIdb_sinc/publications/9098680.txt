abstract
several experiments were conducted to study the effects of established or potential antiparkinsonian drugs on the tremulous jaw
movements induced by the anticholinesterase tacrine ž9-amino- xxxd3270xxx  hydrochloride.. in the first group of four
experiments, separate groups of animals that received 2.5 or 5.0 mgrkg tacrine showed a dose-dependent decrease in tremulous jaw
movements following co-administration of the non-selective dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine, the full dopamine d 2 receptor
agonist bromocriptine, and the full  xxxg655xxx  agonist apb ž ržq.-6-bromo-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1 h-3-benzazepine.. co-administration of the partial  xxxg655xxx  agonist skf 38393 ž ržq.-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1h-benzazepine; 7.5–30.0 mgrkg. did not reduce tremulous jaw movements produced by 2.5 or 5.0 mgrkg tacrine. in
animals treated with 2.5 mgrkg tacrine, co-administration of skf 38393 resulted in a dose-related trend towards a potentiation of
tremulous jaw movements. in the second group of experiments, all rats received 2.5 mgrkg tacrine. the dopamine precursor l-dopa
žl-3, xxxd2471xxx ., the dopamine and norepinephrine releasing agent amantadine, and the muscarinic receptor antagonist
benztropine all reduced tremulous jaw movements induced by 2.5 mgrkg tacrine. across all experiments, it was noted that apomorphine,
bromocriptine and benztropine were more potent than amantadine and l-dopa. these results are broadly consistent with the therapeutic
doses of these agents noted in the clinical literature. the results of these experiments indicate that tremulous jaw movements in rats may
be a useful model for evaluating potential antiparkinsonian agents. q 1997 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
considerable evidence indicates that cholinergic systems are involved in idiopathic and drug-induced parkinsonism žduvoisin, 1967; marsden et al., 1975; acquilonius, 1980.. muscarinic receptor antagonists frequently are
used as treatments for neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism
žmarsden et al., 1975; mcevoy, 1983.. several studies
have shown that cholinomimetic drugs can induce or exacerbate parkinsonian symptoms in humans. muscarinic receptor agonists have been shown to enhance parkinsonism
žnoring et al., 1984.. the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
physostigmine was shown to worsen symptoms of idiopathic parkinson’s disease žduvoisin, 1967.. physostigmine also has been shown to exacerbate ‘rabbit syndrome’,
which is a neuroleptic-induced perioral tremor žweiss et
al., 1980.. the anticholinesterase tacrine žcognex., which

is used to treat alzheimer’s disease, can lead to the
production of parkinsonian side-effects such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor žott and lannon, 1992; keltner,
1994.. ott and lannon ž1992. demonstrated that tacrineinduced parkinsonism could be ameliorated by  xxxd2471xxx  žl-dopa..
one of the motor effects of cholinomimetics in rats is
the induction of tremulous jaw movements žalso known as
‘ vacuous jaw movements’ or ‘ vacuous’, or ‘purposeless’
chewing.. tremulous jaw movements are rapid vertical
deflections of the lower jaw that resemble chewing, but are
not directed at any particular object; these movements are
induced by centrally acting muscarinic receptor agonists
and anticholinesterases žrupniak et al., 1983; salamone et
al., 1986; stewart et al., 1988; levin et al., 1989; salamone et al., 1990; collins et al., 1991, 1993; baskin et al.,
1994; carriero et al., 1996; mayorga et al., 1996.. more
recently, the anticholinesterase tacrine has been shown to
induce a dose-related increase in tremulous jaw move-

ments in the range of 2.5–10.0 mgrkg žmayorga et al.,
1996.. these movements were reduced by systemic or
ventrolateral striatal microinjection of scopolamine
žmayorga et al., 1996.. slow motion videotape analysis
showed that the local frequency of tacrine-induced jaw
movements peaked in the range of 3–6.6 hz žmayorga et
al., 1996., which is consistent with the tremor frequency
that is observed in parkinsonian patients žadams and
victor, 1981.. thus, it has been suggested that tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements share some characteristics with human parkinsonian tremor žcarriero et al.,
1996; mayorga et al., 1996..
one of the ways in which tremulous jaw movements
resemble human parkinsonism is that, in both cases, there
is an interaction between dopamine and acetylcholine.
several lines of evidence indicate that dopamine and
acetylcholine systems interact to affect motor control
žacquilonius, 1980; duvoisin, 1967; bartholini, 1987.. as
well as being produced by cholinomimetics, jaw movements that resemble chewing are induced by dopamine
receptor antagonists, and by pharmacological and neurotoxic depletion of dopamine žrupniak et al., 1983; jicha
and salamone, 1991; baskin and salamone, 1993; steinpreis et al., 1993; steinpreis and salamone, 1993; finn et
al., 1996.. haloperidol-induced jaw movements were enhanced by both pilocarpine and physostigmine žrupniak et
al., 1983.. the chewing-like jaw movements produced by
haloperidol were also decreased by scopolamine žrupniak
et al., 1983; steinpreis et al., 1993.. reserpine plus a low,
presynaptic dose of apomorphine led to tremulous jaw
movements in the same frequency range as tacrine-induced
movements; these movements were suppressed by co-administration of scopolamine žsalamone and baskin, 1996..
conversely, the jaw movements produced by pilocarpine
were reduced by the non-selective dopamine agonist apomorphine žstewart et al., 1988..
it was of interest in the present study to determine if
antiparkinsonian drugs would be effective at reducing
tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements. two groups of
experiments were conducted. in the first group of experiments, apomorphine žlees, 1993., the full dopamine d 1
receptor agonist ržq.-6-bromo-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1 h-3-benzazepine žapb; skf
82958; o’boyle et al., 1989., and the full dopamine d 2
receptor agonist bromocriptine were studied. although the
partial dopamine d 1 receptor agonist skf 38393 ž ržq.2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1h-benzazepine.
has been reported to be ineffective at reducing parkinsonian symptoms in monkeys žclose et al., 1990. and humans žbraun et al., 1987. it was also evaluated to validate
the present animal model. for the first group of experiments, two doses of tacrine ž2.5 and 5.0 mgrkg. were
used to induce tremulous jaw movements. doses of apomorphine, apb, bromocriptine, or skf 38393 were co-administered with the low or high dose of tacrine and the
effects upon tremulous jaw movements were evaluated.

based upon the results of the first group of experiments, a
single dose of tacrine ž2.5 mgrkg. was used for the
evaluation of additional drugs in the second group of
experiments. the catecholamine releasing agent amantadine and the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist
benztropine have antiparkinsonian effects in non-human
primates and humans; these drugs were evaluated along
with l-dopa for their effects on tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements.

2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
a total of 164 male sprague-dawley rats žharlan
sprague-dawley. weighing between 300–400 g were used
in the present study. these animals were group housed in a
colony maintained at 238c which was on a 12-h lightrdark
cycle žlights on 07:00 h.. water and food were available
ad libitum. all rats were cared for according to university
guidelines.
2.2. drugs
tacrine ž9-amino- xxxd3270xxx  hydrochloride., apomorphine hydrochloride, and l-dopa žl3, xxxd2471xxx . were obtained from sigma
žst. louis, mo, usa..  xxxd136xxx , benztropine mesylate, bromocriptine žžq.-bromocriptine
methanesulfonate., apb žskf 82958 or ž".-chloro-apb
hbr. and skf 38393 žž".-skf 38393 hydrochloride.
were obtained from research biochemicals international
žboston, ma, usa.. all drugs were dissolved in 0.1%
ascorbate obtained from fisher žfair lawn, nj, usa..
amantadine, apomorphine, and benztropine were injected
in volumes of 1.0 mlrkg. apb was injected at 2.0 mlrkg.
bromocriptine, l-dopa, and skf 38393 were dissolved
in volumes of 6.0 mlrkg. with the exception of the
l-dopa experiment, all drug treatments were given in a
single injection that combined tacrine and one of the doses
of other drugs. with l-dopa, different doses of l-dopa
or injections of vehicle were made in a separate injection
given 50 min before tacrine.
2.3. behaõioral procedures
although a number of different drug treatments were
studied, all rats received an i.p. injection that contained
tacrine, either alone or in combination with another drug.
immediately after injection of tacrine, rats were placed in
an elevated plexiglas observation box ž28 = 28 = 28 cm,
with a wire mesh floor. for a 10 min habituation period.
all rats were observed for a 5-min period, 10–15 min after
tacrine injection. an observer blind to treatment recorded
the number of tremulous jaw movements, yawns, and rears

m.s. cousins et al.r european journal of pharmacology 322 (1997) 137–145

with mechanical hand counters and noted the occurrence
of stereotypy že.g., repetitive tongue protrusions, licking or
gnawing.. tremulous jaw movements were defined as
rapid vertical deflections of the lower jaw that resembled
chewing but were not directed at any apparent physical
stimulus. yawns were defined as a gradual opening of the
mouth, with a brief pause in the fully open position,
ending with a rapid closure that was more rapid than the
initial opening. if an animal was observed to groom or
exhibit directed chewing, there was a 5 s time-out period
during which tremulous jaw movements or yawns were not
counted. rears were counted when both forepaws were
vertical to the horizontal plane of the top of the rear paws.
2.4. experiments
in the first four experiments, the effects of apomorphine, bromocriptine, skf 38393 and apb on tacrine-induced jaw movements were assessed. separate groups of
rats were used for each of the four drug experiments, and
within each experiment, separate groups of rats were assigned to receive either 2.5 or 5.0 mgrkg of tacrine in
order to induce tremulous jaw movements. the numbers of
rats assigned to each experiment were as follows: apomorphine ž n s 9, n s 10, with low and high dose of tacrine,
respectively., bromocriptine ž n s 18, n s 18., skf 38393
ž n s 18, n s 17, respectively., or apb ž n s 18, n s 14,
respectively.. in addition to receiving one dose of tacrine
alone, each rat also received injections of tacrine plus the
dopamine agonist being assessed. the following doses
were used: apomorphine ž0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mgrkg.,
bromocriptine ž5.0, 10.0, 20.0 mgrkg., skf 38393 ž7.5,
15.0, 30.0 mgrkg., or apb ž0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mgrkg.. within
each of the four experiments, every rat received four drug
treatments ži.e., one dose of tacrine alone, and the same
dose of tacrine plus a low, middle, or high challenge dose
of dopamine agonist., once a week for 4 weeks in a
randomly varied order. thus, each experiment in this first
group of four had a 2 = 4 design žtwo tacrine doses with
separate groups, and four different drug treatments within
each group..
in the second phase of this investigation, three experiments were conducted to study the ability of amantadine,
benztropine and l-dopa to reverse the effects of 2.5
mgrkg tacrine on jaw movements. as in the first four
experiments, separate groups of rats were used to assess
each drug žamantadine, n s 18; benztropine, n s 9; ldopa, n s 15.. in addition to receiving one dose of 2.5
mgrkg tacrine alone, each rat also received injections of
tacrine plus three doses of either amantadine ž15.0, 30.0,
60.0 mgrkg., benztropine ž2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mgrkg., or
l-dopa ž50.0, 100.0, 200.0 mgrkg.. for all three experiments, each rat received one of the four drug treatments
ži.e., tacrine alone, or tacrine plus a low, middle, or high
challenge dose of the other drug. once a week for 4 weeks
in a randomly varied order.

2.5. data analysis
the seven experiments were analyzed separately. in the
first four experiments, tremulous jaw movements were
analyzed by a 2 = 4 žtacrine dose = dose of co-administered drug. factorial analysis of variance žanova. with
repeated measures on drug dose žsystat version 5.0,
evanston, il, usa.. for the last three experiments, tremulous jaw movements were analyzed by a repeated measures anova with four levels žtacrine alone and tacrine
plus three doses of the other drug.. planned comparisons
žkeppel, 1982. were made between the tacrine-alone condition and each of the three drug conditions in which
another drug was co-administered with tacrine. in the first
four experiments, if there was no significant interaction
then the 2.5 and 5.0 mgrkg tacrine groups were combined
for the planned comparisons. single degree of freedom
linear contrasts were also conducted žsystat, version 5.0..
significance was determined at the 5% significance level.
because their was very little yawning or rearing behavior,
these data were not analyzed.

had less than 20 tremulous jaw movements. in contrast,
none of the other challenge drugs had greater than 10% of
the observations with less than 20 tremulous jaw movements ž10% of apb observations, 8% of skf 38393, 7%
of l-dopa, 4% of amantadine and 4% of bromocriptine..

4. discussion
consistent with previous reports, the anticholinesterase
tacrine produced high levels of jaw movement activity
žcarriero et al., 1996; mayorga et al., 1996.. skf 38393
was ineffective at reducing tremulous jaw movements, and
instead produced a trend towards an increase in the tremulous jaw movements induced by the lower dose of tacrine.
these results are consistent with previous work showing
that skf 38393 failed to suppress  xxxd2950xxx induced
vacuous chewing žlevin et al., 1989., and that skf 38393
also is capable of producing low levels of jaw movement
activity žrosengarten et al., 1993; but see also murray and
waddington, 1989.. apomorphine, apb, bromocriptine,
amantadine, benztropine and l-dopa all reduced tacrineinduced tremulous jaw movements in a dose-dependent
manner. apomorphine, benztropine and bromocriptine were
much more potent than amantadine and l-dopa for reducing tacrine-induced jaw movements. this pattern of relative potency is similar to the pattern shown in the clinical
usage of these antiparkinsonian drugs žoertel and dodel,
1995.. therefore, several different antiparkinsonian drugs,
with a variety of different pharmacological actions, all
were effective at reducing tremulous jaw movements produced by tacrine.
the present data are consistent with previous work that
examined cholinomimetic-induced tremulous jaw movements. in the present study, the centrally acting muscarinic
receptor antagonist benztropine was shown to block
tacrine-induced jaw movements. several previous reports
have demonstrated that the jaw movements induced by
pilocarpine, physostigmine, or tacrine can be reduced by
the centrally acting muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, but
not by methyl scopolamine žrupniak et al., 1983; salamone et al., 1986; stewart et al., 1989; mayorga et al.,
1996.. furthermore, local injections of either scopolamine,
methyl scopolamine, or atropine into the ventrolateral
neostriatum have been shown to block the tremulous jaw
movements induced by tacrine, physostigmine, carbachol,
or pilocarpine žkelley et al., 1989; salamone et al., 1990;
kikuchi de beltran et al., 1992; mayorga et al., 1996..
taken together, these data indicate that cholinomimetics
produce tremulous jaw movements by stimulation of central muscarinic receptors, which are likely to be located in
the ventrolateral portion of the neostriatum. additionally,
the present results provide further evidence of acetylcholinerdopamine interactions in the production of tremulous jaw movements. using the cholinergic receptor agonist pilocarpine, stewart et al. ž1988. had determined that

tremulous jaw movements can be reduced by apomorphine
co-administration. the present study confirmed these findings with apomorphine, and extended them to include
some additional dopamine receptor agonists.
in the parkinsonian drug literature, there has been debate for some time about the relative effectiveness of d 1
and d 2 stimulation for producing antiparkinsonian effects.
it is well known that non-selective dopamine receptor
agonists, such as apomorphine, can have antiparkinsonian
effects žlees, 1993.. moreover, drugs that are somewhat
d 2 selective, such as bromocriptine, also are effective
antiparkinsonian agents žlang, 1987.. the first widely
studied dopamine d 1 receptor agonist, skf 38393, was
assessed in clinical studies and found to be ineffective for
the treatment of parkinson’s disease žbraun et al., 1987..
this pattern of results suggested that the critical pharmacological characteristic of an antiparkinsonian drug was
dopamine d 2 receptor agonism. however, there are several problems with that conclusion. skf 38393 is only a
partial agonist, with moderate efficacy for stimulating
camp production žwatts et al., 1993.. more recently, a
new generation of dopamine d 1 receptor agonists, such as
dihydrexine, skf 81297 and apb, have been tested in
dopamine-depleted primate models of parkinsonism. these
studies suggest that antiparkinsonian effects can be
achieved by dopamine d 1 receptor agonists žtaylor et al.,
1991; blanchet et al., 1993; vermulen et al., 1993, 1994.,
including apb žakai et al., 1995; gnanalingham et al.,
1995.. the present results confirm and extend these findings, in that skf 38393 was shown to be ineffective at
reversing tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements, yet
the full agonist apb significantly reduced these movements. thus, evidence suggests that either dopamine d 1 or
d 2 receptor agonists can have some antiparkinsonian activity. because some anatomical evidence suggests that
dopamine d 1 and d 2 receptors are localized on distinct
populations of striatal cells, the present results suggest that
dopaminergic modulation of either the ‘direct’ or the ‘indirect’ pathway can produce therapeutic effects in parkinson’s disease žsee young and penney, 1993; alexander et
al., 1990; dichiara et al., 1994.. additional work in both
primates and rodents should focus on the ability of
dopamine receptor agonists of various types to produce
antiparkinsonian effects, so that the critical pharmacological characteristics of the therapeutic effects of these drugs
can be determined.
the neurochemical basis of dopamine receptor agonistinduced reversal of tremulous jaw movements is uncertain.
it has been suggested that dopamine receptor agonists that
decrease the activity of adenylate cyclase would be effective at reducing tremulous jaw movements induced by
cholinomimetics žlevin et al., 1989.. according this view,
the inability of skf 38393 to antagonize tremulous jaw
movements may be related to the d 1-mediated stimulation
of camp production by this drug žizenwasser and katz,
1993.. however, there does not appear to be a simple

m.s. cousins et al.r european journal of pharmacology 322 (1997) 137–145

relation between camp production and cholinomimetic-induced tremulous jaw movements. first of all, there is
conflicting evidence about the effects of bromocriptine and
apomorphine on camp production žgumulka et al., 1976;
battaglia et al., 1985; onali et al., 1985; memo et al.,
1986.. in addition, although dopamine d 1 receptor stimulation is typically seen as activating postsynaptic camp
activity žkebabian and calne, 1979; izenwasser and katz,
1993., dopamine d 1 receptor stimulation can also be uncoupled from camp production žandersen and nielsen,
1986; mailman et al., 1986.. some evidence indicates that
there may be two types of dopamine d 1 receptor, one that
activates adenylate cyclase and one that acts through some
other mechanism žrosengarten et al., 1993; deveney and
waddington, 1995.. it is important to consider that the full
 xxxg655xxx  agonist apb is more efficacious
than skf 38393 at stimulating camp production žo’boyle
et al., 1989; izenwasser and katz, 1993., yet apb actually
decreases tacrine-induced jaw movements. muscarinic receptor agonists are highly effective at inducing tremulous
jaw movements, despite the fact that they decrease camp
production žmckinney et al., 1989.. thus, it remains
unclear if the modulation of cholinomimetic-induced jaw
movements is dependent upon camp mechanisms, or upon
the action of some other second messenger system. the
effect of dopamine receptor agonists on second messenger
activity in the presence of muscarinic stimulation is not
known, and future research should focus upon this type of
neurochemical interaction between dopamine and acetylcholine systems.
when considering the reduction of tacrine-induced jaw
movements by antiparkinsonian drugs, it may also be
useful to consider the effects of dopamine d 1 and d 2
receptor agonists upon in vivo striatal acetylcholine function. cholinergic stimulation is known to induce parkinsonian symptoms, and evidence indicates that dopamine
antagonism or depletions can enhance striatal acetylcholine
release ždeboer et al., 1993.. thus, it is possible that
parkinsonian symptoms are induced by enhanced cholinergic function, and that antiparkinsonian effects of dopamine
receptor agonists could be occurring because these drugs
reduce acetylcholine release. consistent with the present
data, systemic administration of apomorphine žstadler et
al., 1973; guyenet et al., 1974., and bromocriptine ždeboer et al., 1993., have been shown to decrease striatal
extracellular acetylcholine levels. also consistent with the
present data is the finding that under physiological conditions, the partial dopamine d 1 receptor agonist skf 38393
can increase striatal acetylcholine release, whereas the
dopamine d 2 receptor agonist quinpirole decreases striatal
acetylcholine release ždeboer and abercrombie, 1996..
the effects of apb or amantadine upon striatal acetylcholine release have not been evaluated, and future research is needed to evaluate the effects of dopamine
receptor agonists on extracellular acetylcholine in the presence of tacrine. nevertheless, there are some problems in

143

attempting to find a direct relation between striatal acetylcholine activity and tremulous jaw movements. there is
conflicting evidence about the effects of apomorphine on
striatal acetylcholine release žbertorelli and consolo, 1990..
l-dopa, which was effective at reducing tacrine-induced
jaw movements, actually tends to increase striatal acetylcholine levels ždeboer et al., 1993.. also, evidence indicates that reserpine, which can induce tremulous jaw
movements, decreases rather than increases striatal acetylcholine release žbertorelli et al., 1992; imperato et al.,
1994.. thus, as in the case of second messenger production, there is not a clear relation between striatal acetylcholine release and tremulous jaw movements. it is possible that there are several different neurochemical effects
that lead to tremulous jaw movements, and not all of them
are directly dependent upon acetylcholine release. moreover, it is possible that some antiparkinsonian treatments
act to modulate cholinergic transmission, whereas other
treatments have their therapeutic effects via different actions.
in summary, tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements
can be suppressed by antiparkinsonian agents. l-dopa,
apomorphine, amantadine, bromocriptine, apb, and benztropine were effective at reducing tremulous jaw movements produced by tacrine. skf 38393, which is not an
effective treatment for parkinson’s disease, did not reduce
tacrine-induced jaw movements. although l-dopa is the
most widely used therapy and has been used against
parkinsonian tremor in alzheimer’s patients žott and lannon, 1992., it is not without its disadvantages. future
research involving tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements in rats can be used to investigate additional antiparkinsonian treatments such as other dopamine receptor
agonists, as well as antagonists at acetylcholine, serotonin,
and excitatory amino acid receptors žklockgether et al.,
1991; lees, 1993; dichiara et al., 1994; lange and
riederer, 1994..
