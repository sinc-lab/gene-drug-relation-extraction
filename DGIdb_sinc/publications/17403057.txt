summary
 xxxd105xxx , a recombinant leucocyte function-associated antigen-3 ( xxxg395xxx )/
igg1 fusion protein approved for the treatment of psoriasis, is reported
to reduce selectively the numbers of circulating cd4+ cd45ro+ and
cd8+ cd45ro+ t cells, while sparing the naive cells. the purpose of the
present study was to elucidate further the effect of  xxxd105xxx  on various circulating lymphocyte subsets. sixteen patients, 12 with chronic plaque psoriasis
and four with pustular psoriasis, received  xxxd105xxx  7·5 mg once weekly for
12 weeks. blood samples collected at study entry and after 12 weeks of treatment were analysed by four-colour flow cytometry. there were statistically
significant reductions in the total number of conventional memory
(cd45ra– cd27+) and effector (cd45ra– cd27– or cd45ra+ cd27–) t
cells, including cd4+ and cd8+ t cells expressing cd161 and cd8+ t cells
expressing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (cla). natural killer
(nk) t cells were also reduced significantly, while no statistically significant
changes were seen in nk cells and cd4+ cd25high cells. the affected subpopulations were all characterized by a high expression of  xxxg377xxx . however,
cd4+ cd25low, and cd4+ cla+ cells, which also expressed relative high levels
of  xxxg377xxx , were not reduced significantly. our results suggest a heterogeneous
effect of  xxxd105xxx  on the circulating memory t cell population, indicating that
high expression of  xxxg377xxx  may not, by itself, be sufficient to explain the reduction in cell count for a specific subpopulation.

introduction
 xxxd105xxx  is a recombinant leucocyte function-associated
antigen-3 ( xxxg395xxx )/igg1 fusion protein (amevive, biogen,
cambridge, uk) designed to bind to  xxxg377xxx  molecules on t
cells via the  xxxg395xxx  part and to  xxxg775xxx  on accessory cells via
the fc part, thereby mediating t cell apoptosis [1]. in large
clinical trials,  xxxd105xxx  has been shown to produce significant clinical improvements in patients with chronic plaque
psoriasis and to reduce circulating levels of cd4+ and cd8+
memory t cells, while sparing the naive populations [2–6].
adding to the growing body of evidence that t cells with a
memory or activated phenotype are pathogenic in psoriasis,
the selective reduction in memory cells found in these
studies, which has been explained by an up-regulation of
 xxxg377xxx  compared to naive cells [7–10], was well correlated with
clinical efficacy. however, as memory/activated t cells make
up a large and heterogeneous population, the detailed
phenotype and functional nature of the true pathogenic

immunocyte in psoriasis still remains to be established.
among several possible candidates, special interest has been
concentrating on t cells expressing the cutaneous
lymphocyte-associated antigen (cla) or other homing or
chemokine receptors that may guide these cells to the psoriatic lesions [11,12]. other studies have focused on the role of
regulatory t cells and t cells expressing natural killer (nk)
cell markers [13–15]. the latter includes (1) nk t cells,
which are cd1d-restricted t cells that express certain nk
cell markers variably, and (2) non-cd1d-restricted t cells
expressing natural killer cell receptors such as cd94, cd158
and cd161, sometimes referred to as nk t-like cells [16].
in the present study, we wished to characterize further the
effect of  xxxd105xxx  on various subpopulations of memory
t lymphocytes, and to clarify whether certain other subsets, in
particular skin-homing lymphocytes, nk t, nk t-like cells
and cd4+ cd25+ cells, were affected. also, we were interested
to analyse the correlation between the surface expression of
 xxxg377xxx , assessed by median fluorescent intensity (mfi), and

the reduction in cell count for the relevant lymphocyte
subsets.

materials and methods
patients and ethics
sixteen patients (age 33–74 years, mean 53), 12 with chronic
plaque psoriasis and four with pustular psoriasis, were
enrolled into the study. nine of the patients had not been
receiving systemic therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to entry
in the study. in the plaque psoriasis group, where five
patients also had psoriasis arthritis, three patients received
15–17·5 mg methotrexate (mtx) weekly at study entry and
continued this treatment, while two other patients continued
treatment with 3–4 mg/kg cyclosporin daily. in the pustular
psoriasis group, one patient continued treatment with mtx,
while another patient continued treatment with both mtx
and cyclosporin. all patients received 7·5 mg  xxxd105xxx 
(amevive) intravenously once weekly for 12 weeks. in the
plaque psoriasis group, psoriasis area and severity index
(pasi) evaluations were performed at baseline and once
weekly during treatment, and patients were classified as
responders (pasi score reduction ⱖ50%) or non-responders
(pasi score reduction < 50%), respectively. the study protocol was approved by the scientific ethical committee for
copenhagen county (kf 01–162) and conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki v. all subjects gave
written informed consent.

peripheral blood samples

fitc, anti-cd45ro-pe, anti-cd62l-pe, anti-ccr7af647, anti-cla-fitc, anti-va24-pe, anti-vb11-fitc and
6b11-pe. anti-va24-pe and anti-vb11-fitc were purchased from immunotech (marseille, france). all other antibodies were purchased from bd biosciences pharmingen
(san jose, ca, usa).

flow cytometry analysis
thawed cryopreserved aliquots were washed twice in
phosphate buffered saline (pbs) and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies following the
manufacturer’s protocol. after incubation at 4°c in the dark
for 30 min, cells were washed with pbs and analysed by
four-colour flow cytometry on a fluorescence activated cell
sorter (facsaria) apparatus (bd biosciences) using facs
diva software. cells isolated from pretreatment samples and
from samples obtained after 12 weeks of treatment from
each individual patient were analysed in the same run.
for detection of major lymphocyte subsets a minimum of
10 000 events were collected for each sample, while at least
250 000 events were collected to ensure possible detection of
nk t cells. samples were gated on lymphocytes using
forward and side light-scatter parameters and a cd45/cd14
antibody combination (leucogate) was used to establish this
gate (i.e. lymphocytes identified as cd45bright cd14negative
cells). the lymphocyte purity within the gate was checked by
the lymphosum (sum of cd3+ cells,  xxxg375xxx + cells and cd3–
 xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx + cd56+ cells), and samples with < 85% purity and/or
< 90% recovery were excluded from analysis. absolute
counts of the analysed lymphocyte subsets were calculated
by multiplying the specific subset percentage by the absolute
lymphocyte count determined from the edta-containing
samples analysed on a sysmex xe2100 (sysmex corporation, kobe, japan).

blood samples were obtained from each subject just prior to
the first dose of  xxxd105xxx  (baseline) and after 12 weeks of
treatment. venous blood was collected into heparin and
ethylemediamine tetraacetic acid (edta) anti-coagulant
vacutainers for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmc) and analysis of haematology parameters,
respectively. pmbc were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over lymphoprep (axis-shield, oslo, norway)
and cryopreserved in medium containing rpmi-1640
(50%), serum (30%), and dimethylsulphoxide (dmso,
20%). the average viability of pbmc after thawing was
approximately 95%.

data are presented as mean ⫾ standard error of the mean
(s.e.m.). the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank sum test
was used to analyse differences in paired data. spearman’s
correlation test was used to access the relationship between
variables, where appropriate. results with p-values < 0·05
were considered significant.

statistical analysis

identification of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry
we used the combination of anti-cd45ra and anti-cd27 to
distinguish between naive (cd45ra+ cd27+), conventional
memory (cd45ra– cd27+), effector (cd45ra– cd27–) and
terminally differentiated effector (cd45ra+ cd27–) t cells.
in agreement with previous reports, the latter subpopulation
of terminally differentiated t cells was found exclusively

 xxxd105xxx -induced changes in circulating lymphocyte subpopulations

among cd8+ cells. naive and memory t cells, as well as
terminally differentiated cd8+ cells and effector cd4+ cells,
all separated into distinct populations. in contrast, effector
cd8+ cells, which were generally few in number or even
missing, appeared as a less well-defined population and were
excluded from further analysis.
we also attempted to characterize naive and memory
subpopulations with combinations of anti-cd45ra with
anti-ccr7 and anti-cd62l. however, anti-ccr7 generally
showed very poor staining, while staining with anti-cd62l
did not provide fully reproducible results, as a fraction of
cd45ra positive cells in some samples apparently lost their
expression of cd62l during the freezing/thawing procedure, a problem that has been reported by others [17]. as
expected, cla, cd161 and cd25, like cd45ra and cd27,
displayed a continuum of expression that did not resolve
into distinct positive and negative populations. thus, for
these markers, demarcation of positive cells was based only
on comparison with the isotype control. among cd4+ cells,
all three markers were found exclusively on cd45ro+ t cells,
while within cd8+ cells a minor proportion of the cla+ and
cd161+ cells were also found among cd45ro– cells, probably td cells, but further characterization of these subsets
with other memory/effector markers was not performed. in
the case of cd25, we used the gating strategy described by
lundgren and co-workers, which is based on comparison
with the expression of cd25 on cd8+ t cells, to discriminate
cd4+cd25high from cd4+ cd25low t cells [18]. the cla+
and cd161+ t cells represented predominantly different cell
populations, as the vast majority of cla+ cells were negative
for cd161+ and vice versa (i.e. less than 0·5% were
cla+ cd161+).
type 1 nk t cells were identified by combinations of anticd3 with anti-vb11 and anti-va24. however, distinct
populations (> 10 events) of type 1 nk t cells could be
demonstrated clearly in only seven of 16 patients, where they
comprised about 0·07% (range 0·01–0·16%) of the total
peripheral lymphocytes at study entry. this lack of detectable nk t cells in nine patients was not due to poor staining
with the antibodies used, as cd3+ va24+ cells and
cd3+ vb11+ cells were seen in all patients, both constituting
around 0·5% of the total lymphocyte population. in addition, we obtained similar results using a combination of
 xxxd2676xxx  and monoclonal antibody (moab) 6b11, the latter
of which recognizes the conserved region of va24–ja18 t
cell receptor (tcr).

expression of  xxxg377xxx  on lymphocyte subsets
the level of  xxxg377xxx  expression at baseline for each examined
lymphocyte subpopulation, as assessed by the mfi, is shown
in table 1.
 xxxg377xxx  expression was significantly higher on memory t
cells compared to naive cells, within both cd4+ (in 16 of 16
patients; p < 0·0001) and cd8+ (in 15 of 16 patients;

p = 0·0017). however, while effector cd4+ cells had even
higher  xxxg377xxx  expression compared to memory cd4+ cells
(p < 0·0005), there was no difference between memory cells,
effector cells and td cells within the cd8+ population.
as circulating t cells expressing cd25, cla or cd161
probably belong exclusively to the memory/effector cell
population, it was not surprising that the expression of  xxxg377xxx 
on subsets expressing one of these markers was closer to that
of memory/effector cells than to that of naive cells
(p < 0·0001). the expression of  xxxg377xxx  on cd4+ cd25low cells,
being similar to that of cd4+ memory cells, was on average
slightly higher than on cd4+ cd25high cells (p = 0·0155).
on average, approximately 70% of nk cells expressed
 xxxg377xxx , but with considerable variability between subjects
(range 30–100%), and the level of  xxxg377xxx  expression on these
cells was only about half the value of that for the average t
cells.
for the seven patients in whom type 1 nk t cells could be
detected, the  xxxg377xxx  expression on these cells was not different
from that of memory cd4+ cells.
following  xxxd105xxx  treatment all examined lymphocyte
subsets, except for b cells, showed on average a significant
decrease in  xxxg377xxx  signal of 25·2 ⫾ 1·1% (p < 0·0001). there
was some variation in this decrease between the different
subsets (range 15–32%) and a substantial variation between
individuals (range -25% to 60%), but it was not correlated
with changes in cell count for any of the examined subsets.
one possible explanation for this change and for the difference between subjects could be that variations in  xxxd105xxx 
concentration in the blood at the time of blood sample
drawing causes a more or less effective binding of  xxxd105xxx 
that could hinder sterically the binding of fluorochromelabelled anti- xxxg377xxx .

changes in major lymphocyte subsets
only minor changes were seen in the percentages of total t
cells, cd4+ cells, cd8+ cells, b cells and nk cells following
treatment with  xxxd105xxx  (data not shown). in 14 of 16
patients, total lymphocyte counts were reduced significantly,
which was accounted for primarily by a significant decrease
in t cells affecting both cd4+ and cd8+ cells (table 1). the
reduction in cd8+ cells was correlated with the reduction in
cd4+ cells (r = 0·6794, p = 0·038), with cd8+ being slightly
more affected (p = 0·0273). no statistically significant
changes were observed for nk cells. in contrast, b cells
showed an unexpected decrease which was, however, not
statistically significant when patients receiving mtx in addition to  xxxd105xxx  were excluded from analysis.

changes in naive and memory t lymphocyte subsets
following treatment with  xxxd105xxx  there was a significant
enrichment in the proportion of naive cells (8–10%) within
both cd4+ and cd8+, with a corresponding decrease in the

the relative expression of  xxxg377xxx  for each subpopulation was assessed as the median fluorescent intensity (mfi) ratio (mfi of cells staining positive
for allophycocyanin-conjugated anti- xxxg377xxx /mfi of isotype). the reduction in total cell count was calculated as: [total cell count at baseline - total count
after 12 weeks of treatment with  xxxd105xxx )/total cell count at baseline ¥ (100)]. positive values denote reduction in cell count, negative values denote an
increase. all data are expressed as mean ⫾ standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). values for all included patients (n = 16, except for natural killer (nk) t
cells where n = 7) in the study protocol are shown in bold type. values for patients treated with  xxxd105xxx  only (n = 9) are shown in brackets. the
wilcoxon signed-rank test p-values for the reduction in cell count are specified.

proportion of memory/effector cells. however, there was a
moderate reduction in the absolute number of naive cd8+
cells that did reach statistical significance, whereas no significant change for cd4+ cells in the absolute number of naive
cells was observed (table 1). another difference between
cd4+ and cd8+ cells was a more pronounced decrease in the
absolute number for effector cd4+ cells than for memory
cd4+ cells (p = 0·0005), whereas the reductions in memory
cells and td cells were more similar for cd8+ cells. similarly,
in experiments where effective staining with anti-cd62l was
obtained, cd4+ with an ‘effector memory’ phenotype
(cd45ra– cd62l–) were more affected than cells with a
‘central memory’ (cd45ra– cd62l+) phenotype while
there was no difference between cd45ra- cd62l- and
cd45ra- cd62l+ cd8 cells (data not shown).

addition to  xxxd105xxx  (table 1). an apparent difference was
seen for b cells and for naive cd4+ and cd8+ cells, as these
subsets had lower pretreatment values and seemed to be
more affected in the group of patients who received mtx
(data not shown). of the two patients who received
cyclosporin in addition to  xxxd105xxx , one had generally higher
reductions, whereas the other had generally lower reductions
compared to the means for the respective subsets of lymphocytes in patients receiving  xxxd105xxx  only. however, patient
numbers in these treatment groups were too small to
perform statistical analysis.

clinical observations

although t cells expressing cd25low, cd161 or cla all
belong to the memory/effector pool, subsets expressing one
of these markers were not affected equally. hence, neither
cd4+ cd25low nor cd4+ cla+ cells showed statistically significant changes in percentages (data not shown) or absolute
counts following treatment (table 1). by contrast, cd4+ and
cd8+ t cells expressing cd161 and cd8+ cla+ decreased
significantly in absolute numbers.

 xxxd105xxx  was generally well tolerated and only minor
adverse effects were observed. in the plaque psoriasis group
reductions in pasi score during the 12 weeks of treatment
ranged from 0 to 93% (mean 46 ⫾ 10%), with six of 12
being responders (pasi score reduction > 50%). the pasi
score showed no statistically significant correlation with the
reductions in any of the investigated lymphocyte subpopulations (data not shown). in the group of patients with
pustular psoriasis, only one patient showed clinical improvements during the treatment course. none of the five patients
with psoriasis arthritis experienced improvement in joint
symptoms.

changes in cd4+ cd25high and nk t cells

discussion

as shown in table 1, there was a significant reduction in the
absolute number of type 1 nk t cells, whereas the smaller
reduction in absolute numbers of cd4+ cd25high did not
reach statistically significance.

consistent with previous reports, our data show that
memory populations of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells are reduced
significantly in response to  xxxd105xxx  therapy, whereas naive
cells are affected only slightly (cd8+ cells) or practically
unchanged (cd4+ cells). the aim of the present study was to
characterize further the effect of  xxxd105xxx  on the memory/
effector t cell compartment in peripheral blood. to this end,
cd45ra and cd27 were used as the primary combination to
identify naive, conventional memory, effector and terminally
differentiated effector cells. using this combination, the
main findings were that within cd4+ cells, the effector
subpopulation (cd45ra– cd27–) was even more affected
than conventional memory cells (cd45ra– cd27+), whereas
within cd8+ cells, terminally differentiated effector cells
(td; cd45ra+ cd27–) and memory cells were affected
equally. although the use of cryopreserved cells impeded
reliable staining with cd62l, some successful experiments
nevertheless showed the same tendency; that is, cd45ra–
62l– cells (‘effector memory’) were more affected
than cd45ra- cd62l+ cells (‘central memory’) within
cd4+ cells, while there was no difference between
cd45ra+ cd62l– and cd45ra– cd62l+ cells within cd8+
cells. however, a direct comparison between cd4+ and cd8+
cells on this issue is difficult, as many reported data have
emphasized the complexity of memory t cells and the difficulties in finding useful markers to distinguish memory and

correlation between  xxxg377xxx  expression and reductions
in cell counts
from the data presented in table 1 it appears that for a
specific lymphocyte subset there was a good correlation
between the average  xxxg377xxx  expression and the average reduction in absolute cell count, except for cd4+ cd25low and
cd4+ cla+ t cells, which were not reduced significantly
despite a relative high  xxxg377xxx  expression. however, the correlation was not strong when analysed for pools of naive,
memory and effector subsets within cd4+ or cd8+ cells,
respectively (fig. 1), and did not reach statistical significance
when analysed within each single subset (data not shown),
except for the cd8+ cla+ cells (p = 0·0142).

overall, the changes in the various lymphocyte subsets
showed rather similar patterns when patients receiving no
other systemic therapy than  xxxd105xxx  were compared with
patients continuing treatment with mtx or cyclosporin in

effector functions (reviewed in [19]). hence, the impact of
the obvious difference with the markers used here, the occurrence of cd45ra+ cd27– (equivalent to cd45ra+ cd62l–)
cells almost exclusively within cd8+ cells, is not understood
fully and may reflect differences between cd4+ and cd8+
cells in the differentiation pathway from naive to memory/
effector cells. nevertheless, td cd8+ cells are thought to be
antigen-primed, so their existence is a main reason why discrimination between naive and memory cells based solely on
the cd45 isoform expression has been proved to be unreliable. td cd8+ cells are present in large numbers in some
individuals, in health and disease, and are of interest because
‘effector’ t cells, in particular within cd8+ cells, have been
suggested to play a key role in psoriasis. meanwhile, the t
cells which have been found to dominate the lymphocyte
infiltration in psoriasis plaques are often referred to as ‘effec28

tor memory’ cells although, to our knowledge, the use of that
term has so far been based only on the demonstration of t
cells expressing cd45ro+ and/or markers of activation such
as cd25, and not on further characterization by other effector or memory phenotypic markers.
next, we were interested to see if we could differentiate
further the effect of  xxxd105xxx  on separate subpopulations
within the memory/effector t cell compartment and to see if
other lymphocyte phenotypes that might play a role in the
pathogenesis of psoriasis, specifically nk, nk t and
cd4+ cd25+ cells, were affected. although t cells expressing
the activation marker cd25low or the cutaneous homingreceptor cla all belong to the memory/effector pool and
have been found in increased numbers in psoriatic lesions
[10–12], they were not affected equally by  xxxd105xxx . thus,
whereas cd8+ cla+ cells decreased significantly in absolute

 xxxd105xxx -induced changes in circulating lymphocyte subpopulations

numbers, neither cd4+ cd25low nor cd4+ cla+ cells
showed statistically significant changes in percentages or
absolute counts following treatment. it is noteworthy that
one study has demonstrated a correlation between disease
severity in psoriasis patients and the frequency of
cd8+ cla+, but not cd4+ cla+ cells [20].
nk cells and t cells expressing nk cell markers have also
been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
as some nk cells express  xxxg377xxx  they might be targets for
 xxxd105xxx , although the death of target cells caused by  xxxd105xxx  is, paradoxically, in itself nk cell-mediated [21].
however, we observed no significant changes in the nk cell
population, in agreement with previously reported data [3].
in contrast, within both cd4+ and cd8+ subsets, we found
that t cells expressing the nk marker cd161 were reduced in
parallel to memory and/or effector t cells. in concordance
with this these cells expressed cd45ro, indicating that they
were part of the memory/effector population, as has been
suggested previously by others [22]. of note, t cells expressing nk markers such as cd161, some in combination with
vb11 but not va24, have been found in psoriasis plaques
[14], but it has become clear in recent years that only a very
small fraction of t cells expressing nk cell markers are true
so-called type 1 or type 2 nk t cells [16]. we were able to
demonstrate cells only with the cd3+ va24+ vb11+ phenotype, generally accepted to be type 1 nk t cells, in approximately half the patients; that is, in the other half of patients
they comprised less than 0·01% of the t cell population.
regulatory t cells [cd4+ cd25high ctla+  xxxg813xxx 
(foxp3)high] represent another lymphocyte population that
has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis [15], but in contrast to type 1 nk t cells,
cd4+ cd25high cells were unaffected by  xxxd105xxx  in our study.
it is obvious to assume that the differential effect on the
various lymphocyte subsets found herein can be explained
by differences in the cell surface expression of  xxxg377xxx . indeed,
our results, using mfi as a relative measure of  xxxg377xxx  surface
expression, confirm that  xxxg377xxx  is up-regulated on conventional memory cells compared with naive cells [8,10] and in
addition demonstrates that, within cd4+ cells,  xxxg377xxx  expression is even higher on effector cells than on memory cells. we
actually observed a weak but statistically significant correlation between the reductions in absolute count and the
pretreatment expression of  xxxg377xxx  when the analysis was performed for pools of naive, memory and effector subsets
within cd4+ and cd8+ cells, respectively. moreover, cd8+
cells, which on average had a higher level of  xxxg377xxx  expression
compared to cd4+ cells, were also more affected by  xxxd105xxx 
whereas, for example, nk cells, which had a level of  xxxg377xxx 
expression that was only about half that for the average t
cells, were not significantly reduced. hence,  xxxd105xxx  might
simply target cells with a  xxxg377xxx  expression over a certain
threshold. however, some observations in our study did not
comply with this assumption. first, cd4+ cells expressing
cla or cd25 were not reduced significantly despite a  xxxg377xxx 

expression similar to that of other memory cd4+ cells. secondly, for each identified subset, the correlation between the
sometimes highly variable levels of  xxxg377xxx  expression and the
corresponding change in cell count for each subject did not
reach statistical significance. thirdly, the differences in  xxxg377xxx 
expression between cell subsets that decreased and subsets
that were unaffected after  xxxd105xxx  treatment seemed, in
some cases, to be small. for instance,  xxxg377xxx  expression was
‘only’ 30% higher on memory cd4+ cells compared to naive
cells. these observations indicate that factors other than high
 xxxg377xxx  expression might also be important for the susceptibility to  xxxd105xxx , such as the differential expression of fas
antigen on naive/memory t cell subpopulations, as suggested by others [21].
the limitations of our study include the relative small
number of patients, the inclusion of patients with different
forms of psoriasis and the inclusion of seven patients in
whom maintenance therapy with mtx and/or cyclosporin
were continued. however, it was beyond the scope of this
study to look specifically at the clinical response of  xxxd105xxx 
in psoriasis and the possible correlation of this response with
changes in specific lymphocyte subpopulations. although
such correlations could provide important clues to the
pathophysiology of psoriasis, they would certainly have to be
combined with data from the skin to complete the picture, as
changes in the peripheral circulation may not necessarily
mirror those in the psoriatic lesions [23]. in fact, the local
action of  xxxd105xxx  in the affected skin may be complicated by
a variety of immunoregulatory factors such as possible
expression of  xxxg775xxx  on keratinocytes induced by
interferon-g [24].
the treatment with mtx and/or cyclosporin may have
affected the action of  xxxd105xxx . thus, mtx have been found
to reduce the number of cd4+ and cd8+ cells expressing
cla in psoriasis patients [25] and the number of b cells in
patients with lupus erythematosus [26], whereas cyclosporin
has been found to reduce the number of cd4+ cla+ cells,
but not cd8+ cla+ cells, in children with atopic dermatitis
[27]. however, except for the pretreatment values and the
affection of b cells and naive t cells in the group of patients
who were treated with mtx, we found similar patterns in the
response to  xxxd105xxx  regardless of whether or not the
patients were treated with mtx and/or cyclosporin. this
justified pooling the data from all the included patients,
although we cannot exclude the possibility that for certain
subsets these drugs may have affected susceptibility to
 xxxd105xxx .
in summary, this study has evaluated the effect of  xxxd105xxx  on a variety of circulating lymphocyte subsets hypothesized to play a role in psoriasis and/or other diseases with an
autoimmune pathogenesis and has demonstrated a differentiated effect on specific subsets within the memory/effector
compartment of t cells. the results suggest that the effect
of  xxxd105xxx  may be more complex than simply a matter
of reducing the number of cd45ro+ cells with a high level
