abstract: tacrolimus inhibits lymphocyte responses by blocking calciumdependent signalling pathways important in il-2 generation.  xxxd1798xxx , a
humanized monoclonal antibody, binds with high aﬃnity to the tac subunit
of the  xxxg1175xxx  complex. we reasoned therefore that the absence of  xxxg1174xxx  should permit lower doses of tacrolimus and thereby less toxicity.
twenty-eight patients were randomized and followed for 6 months: group
1, high dose (hd) tacrolimus (trough 12–17 ng/ml; n ¼ 13); group 2, low
dose (ld) tacrolimus (trough 5–10 ng/ml; n ¼ 15). all patients received
 xxxd1798xxx  induction (2 mg/kg) on days 0 and 14,  xxxd2677xxx 
(2 g/d except for one patient who received 1 g) and rapid prednisone taper.
serious infections were minimal in both groups. hospitalizations, for various reasons, were hd (n ¼ 12) and ld (n ¼ 6). all patients and grafts
survived for the 6-month study period. there was one rejection episode in a
non-compliant patient at 101 d. ld tacrolimus appears equally eﬀective as
hd tacrolimus in preventing rejection episodes and may be associated with
fewer adverse events.

tacrolimus (prografò) is an immunosuppressive
agent that inhibits lymphocyte responses by blocking t cell receptor-mediated, calcium-dependent
signalling pathways in a dose-dependent manner
(1). the results from a multicentre concentrationranging trial of prografò, using three dosing levels,
found that high dose (hd) prografò was most
eﬀective in preventing early rejection; however,
there was increased toxicity (2). the low dose (ld)
group had less toxicity but higher rejection rates.
 xxxd1798xxx  (zenapaxò) is an  xxxg1175xxx 
antagonist that binds with high aﬃnity to the tac
subunit of the  xxxg1175xxx  complex (3). we have
used zenapaxò with the majority of our transplant
patients since early spring 1998. our observations,
like those of our predecessors, have been decreased
rejection episodes in prografò-treated patients
(2) and essentially no side-eﬀects/toxicity from
zenapaxò (4, 5). we reasoned that the absence of

 xxxg1175xxx  should minimize the need for il-2 inhibition
by prografò, thereby allowing lower prografò
doses and less toxicity.
based on our clinical experience, we developed a
two-arm study to determine if lower doses of
prografò would be equally eﬀective as higher
doses when used with zenapaxò induction in
de novo kidney transplant recipients. the hypothesis was that there would be no diﬀerence in the
number of rejection episodes between the two
dosing groups.
patients and methods

all de novo kidney transplant patients who were
qualiﬁed, based on the inclusion-exclusion criteria,
were approached for enrolment. the inclusion
criteria were adults who received a cadaveric or
living donation kidney, ﬁrst or second transplant,

and had panel reactive antibodies (pra) less than
50%. exclusion criteria were patients receiving
multiple organs, hiv+, history of malignancy
except basal-cell skin cancer, pregnant/lactating, or
tacrolimus or erythromycin sensitive. there were
45 patients screened and 30 patients who signed
informed consent documents were enrolled in the
study. the 30 patients were randomly assigned to
one of two groups, using a coin toss: group 1 (hd,
trough 12–17 ng/ml; n ¼ 14) and group 2 (ld,
trough 5–10 ng/ml; n ¼ 16). group 1 was comprised of seven african american (aa) males, six
non-african american (naa) males and one naa
female. group 2 was comprised of nine aa males,
four aa females, two naa males and one naa
female. based on the number of hla mismatches
(one or more mismatches), all patients in the hd
group were at risk for rejection; whereas, 14 of the
16 ld group patients were at high risk for
rejection.
donor source in the hd group was four
cadaveric and 10 living donations; and in the ld
group there were nine cadaveric and seven living
donations. among the 30 enrolled patients, 20
were aa and 10 were naa. there were more
cadaveric donors in the ld group and more aas;
theoretically this group would be at higher risk for
rejection (table 1).
within 72 h of enrolment, two patients needed
to be withdrawn from study. among the hd group
of patients, there was one hyperacute rejection
episode resulting in graft loss. a second patient
was withdrawn for technical reasons from the ld
group. both patients were naa males. consequently there were 28 patients for analysis: 13 in
the hd group and 15 in the ld group.
all patients were followed for 6 months posttransplant. data were collected on the number of
rejection episodes, days to ﬁrst rejection episode,
serious adverse events (hypertension, hyperglycaemia, re-hospitalization, serious infections excluding
uti, malignancy), quality of renal function (serum
creatinine level, estimated creatinine clearance) and
patient and graft survival.

results

recognizing the diﬃculty in maintaining the
patients within a group target range, data were
also collected on the number of times a patient was
either within or outside their respective prografò
trough levels. the prografò levels at pod 7, pod
30, pod 90 and pod 180 for the hd group and
the ld group were 13.5 ± 4.9 vs. 9.2 ± 3.3
( p ¼ 0.01); 15.2 ± 4.9 vs. 12.6 ± 6.2 ( p ¼ 0.11,
ns); 12.6 ± 5.5 vs. 9.2 ± 2.5 ( p ¼ 0.03); and
11.0 ± 3.7 vs. 9.4 ± 2.9 ( p ¼ 0.12). the overall
prografò levels for the hd and ld groups were
13.6 ± 5.14
and
10.4 ± 4.06
respectively
( p ¼ 0.0001). none of the patients in either group
was consistently within their respective target
range; noting however, that the ratio of in-trough
to out-of-trough was better maintained for the ld
group (seven of 15 were within trough level more
than outside trough level, compared with four of
13 in the hd group). there were no diﬀerences
between the groups by race. the ratios of in-trough
to out-of-trough by dosing group and race is given
in table 2.
the prografò–zenapaxò combination essentially prevented rejection activity in the ﬁrst 6
months post-transplant. there was only one acute
rejection episode and it was in the ld group
(n ¼ 13) ) 101 d post-transplant in a noncompliant patient who did not have detectable
prografò levels. the patient subsequently lost the
graft at 8 months post-transplant from total drug
non-compliance. there were no other rejection
episodes in the ld group, and there were no other

graft losses. among the hd group (n ¼ 15) there
were no rejection episodes and no graft losses.
the number of serious infections, excluding the
urinary tract, also was minimal in both the hd and
the ld groups. among the hd patients, one
female naa patient had two infections: pneumonia/bronchitis and cmv. whereas in the ld
group, two patients had one infection: a female
naa had a gastrointestinal infection from
h. pylori, a male naa had a cmv infection.
there was one case of malignancy in the hd
group, which occurred after the 6-month follow-up
period. acute mylogenous leukaemia was diagnosed in a naa male 261 d post-transplant. no
occurrences of malignancy were found in the ld
group. patient survival was 100% for both groups.
two patients in the hd group were switched
from prografò to neoralò within the ﬁrst 6
months post-transplant because of hyperglycaemia; one of them developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus. in addition three other patients in the
hd group had an episode of hyperglycaemia.
none of the ld group of patients had their
immunosuppression changed. within the ld
group three patients experienced hyperglycaemia;
all of these patients were aa. kidney function
(average serum creatinine, estimated creatinine
clearance) for the hd and ld groups are given
in table 3. urine protein was assessed; however,
urine protein/creatinine ratios were not calculated
because of the paucity of patients in either group
that had protein in their urine. in the hd group,
ﬁve, one and no patients had urine protein at 1, 3
and 6 months, respectively, post-transplant. in the
ld group, six, four and four patients had urine
protein at 1, 3 and 6 months, respectively, posttransplant. among the six ld group patients with
urine protein at 1 month, only two had urine
protein at all three time periods. essentially there
were no clinical diﬀerences between the two
groups.
kidney function also was assessed using cytodiagnostic urinalysis (cdu) at months 1, 3 and 6
post-transplant. none of the patients in the hd
group had cdu results indicative of rejection at

32

any of the three time points; however, four patients
at month 1, three patients at month 3, and two
patients at month 6 post-transplant had cdu
results that were consistent with tubular injury. in
the ld group, one patient at each of the time
points had cdu results consistent with rejection
and corresponding to an increase in that patient’s
serum creatinine; and cdu results indicative of
tubular injury were found for one patient at month
1, and three patients at months 3 and 6 posttransplant. none of those diﬀerences is statistically
signiﬁcant.
there were 12 hospitalizations, from various
causes, in the hd group and six in the ld group.
the causes for the hospitalization in the hd group
varied, with seven of the 12 being unrelated to
either the transplant procedure or immunosuppression (e.g. stent removal, haemorrhoidectomy,
suture granuloma). the remaining ﬁve hospitalizations were for infection (n ¼ 3) and diabetes
(n ¼ 2). in the ld group, three of the six hospitalizations were not related to either the transplant
procedure or immunosuppression (renal stenosis,
dvt, pulmonary oedema), whereas the remaining
three were for infection (n ¼ 1), gi bleeding
(n ¼ 1) and nausea/vomiting (n ¼ 1).
discussion

ld prografò, on a zenapaxò background, appears
to be as eﬀective as hd prografò in preventing
clinical rejection episodes. side-eﬀects may also be
less, but there were too few patients to draw a
deﬁnitive conclusion. patient and graft survivals
were comparable between groups.
