chembl is an open data database containing binding, functional and admet information for a large
number of drug-like bioactive compounds. these
data are manually abstracted from the primary published literature on a regular basis, then further
curated and standardized to maximize their quality
and utility across a wide range of chemical biology
and drug-discovery research problems. currently,
the database contains 5.4 million bioactivity measurements for more than 1 million compounds and
5200 protein targets. access is available through a
web-based interface, data downloads and web services at: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb.
introduction
a wealth of information on the activity of small molecules
and biotherapeutics exists in the literature, and access to
this information can enable many types of drug discovery
analysis and decision making. for example: selection
of tool compounds for probing targets or pathways of
interest; identiﬁcation of potential off-target activities of
compounds which may pose safety concerns, explain
existing side effects or suggest new applications for old
compounds; analysis of structure–activity relationships
(sar) for a compound series of interest; assessment of
in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
and toxicity (admet) properties; or construction of predictive models for use in selection of compounds potentially active against a new target (1–5). access to this
information is especially important due to the continuing
shift in fundamental research on disease mechanisms from
the private to public sectors.

however, bioactivity data published in journal articles
are usually found in a relatively unstructured format and
are labour-intensive to search and extract. for example,
compound structures are frequently depicted only as
images and are not therefore searchable, protein targets
may be referred to by a variety of synonyms or abbreviations with no reference to any database identiﬁers, and
details of assays may be included only in supplementary
data or by reference to previous publications. in addition,
there is not currently any requirement by most journals for
authors to deposit small-molecule assay results in public
databases (as is the case for sequence, protein structure
and gene expression data). historically, therefore, the
majority of the published small-molecule bioactivity data
have only been readily available via commercial products.
in recent years, in response to the growing demand for
open access to this kind of information, a variety of
public-domain bioactivity resources have been developed.
pubchem bioassay (6) and chembank (7) are large
archival databases providing access to millions of deposited screening results, typically from high-throughput
screening (hts) experiments. a number of other primary
resources extract bioactivity data from literature, but tend
to focus on particular thematic areas, and primarily on
binding afﬁnity information. for example, bindingdb
contains quantitative binding constants manually extracted from publications, focusing chieﬂy on proteins that
are considered to be potential drug targets (8). pdbbind
(9), binding moad (10) and afﬁndb (11) contain binding afﬁnity information for protein–ligand complexes
found in the protein data bank (pdb, 12). pdsp ki
database stores screening data from the national
institute of mental health’s psychoactive drug
screening program (13). brenda provides binding constants for enzymes (14), iuphar contains ligand information for receptors and ion channels (15), while glida

data content
data extraction and curation
the core activity data in the chembl database are
manually extracted from the full text of peer-reviewed scientiﬁc publications in a variety of journals, such as journal
of medicinal chemistry, bioorganic medicinal chemistry
letters and journal of natural products. the set of journals covered is by no means comprehensive, but is selected
to capture the greatest quantity of high-quality data in a
cost, and time-effective manner. from each publication,
details of the compounds tested, the assays performed and
any target information for these assays are abstracted.
structures for small molecules are drawn in full, in
machine-readable format, despite the structure often being
provided as a scaffold and a list of r-group substituents,
or referred to only by name in the original publication.
information about the particular salt form tested is also
captured, where available, although this is often inconsistent in the literature. before loading to the database, structures are checked for potential problems (e.g. unusual
valence on atoms, incorrect structures for common compounds/drugs), then normalized according to a set of
rules, to ensure consistency in representation (e.g. compounds are neutralized by protonating/deprotonating
acids and bases to ensure a formal charge of zero where
possible). preferred representations are used for certain
common groups (e.g. sugars, sulphoxides and nitroxides).
some chemical structures are typically only reported in an
implicit format, and this is checked and assigned on registration—for example, the stereochemistry of the steroid
framework is invariably not published, but is assumed to
be that of the naturally occurring conﬁguration, unless
otherwise deﬁned. common salts are also stripped from
the extracted compounds, and both the salt form and the
parent compound are entered into the database. this
allows users to view all data associated with the same parent compound, regardless of the salt form tested, while
still retaining the salt information if required.

details of all types of assays performed are extracted
from each publication, including binding assays (measuring the interaction of the compound with the target
directly), functional assays (often measuring indirect effects of the compound on a pathway, system or whole
organism) and admet assays (measuring pharmacokinetic properties of the compound, interaction with key
metabolic enzymes or toxic effects on cells/tissues). the
activity endpoints measured in these assays are recorded
with the values and units as given in the paper, but for the
purposes of improved querying are also standardized,
where possible, to convert them to a preferred unit of
measurement for a given activity type (e.g. ic50 values
are displayed in nm, rather than mm/mm/m, half-life is
reported in hours rather than minutes/days/weeks). this
enables the user to more easily compare data across different assays.
to maximize the utility of bioactivity data, the targets
of assays need to be represented robustly and consistently,
in a manner independent of the various adopted names
and synonyms used across different sources. to this end,
detailed manual annotation of targets is carried out within
chembl. where the intended molecular target of an
assay is reported in a publication, this information is extracted, together with associated details of the relevant organism in which the assay was performed (or the organism
from which the protein/cell-line was derived for an in vitro
assay). target assignments are carefully checked by our
curators, and corrected where necessary, then further
annotated where any ambiguity exists. for example, for
an in vitro binding assay, it is often possible to determine
the precise protein target with which the compound is
interacting and assign a single relevant protein to the
assay. however, in other cases this may not be possible.
for example, an assay may describe interaction of a
compound with a target which is known to be a protein/
biomolecular complex (e.g. ribosomes, gaba-a receptors or integrins). in this case, several protein subunits
may be assigned to the assay, but a ‘complex’ ﬁeld in
the database is used to record the fact that these
proteins are associated as a speciﬁc protein complex. in
other cases, the assay performed may not allow elucidation of the precise protein subtypes with which a
compound is interacting (e.g. cell/tissue-based assays
where several closely related subtypes of the protein are
likely to be expressed, or those reported prior to the discovery of particular receptor/enzyme subtypes). again,
the assay may therefore be mapped to each of the possible
protein targets, but a ‘multi’ ﬁeld in the database records
the fact that it is not clear whether the compound is interacting non-speciﬁcally with all of these proteins, and consequently less conﬁdence should be placed in these
assignments.
in many cases, such as whole organism-based phenotypic assays, it is not possible to unambiguously determine
the protein target that is responsible for the observed
effect of the compound. in these cases, the assay will be
mapped to a chembl target representing the nonmolecular system on which an effect is observed. for
example, an assay measuring the cytotoxicity of a
compound against the human breast carcinoma-derived

downloaded from http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ at stanford university on may 3, 2012

(16) and gpcrdb (17) provide information speciﬁcally
for g-protein-coupled receptors. other resources, such
as drugbank, provide detailed annotation around
the properties and mechanism of action of approved
drugs (18).
however, in order to make informed decisions in drug
discovery or to design experiments to probe a biological
system with chemical tools, it is important to consider not
only the binding afﬁnity of a compound for its target, but
also its selectivity, efﬁcacy in functional assays or disease
models and the likely admet properties of the compound. moreover, researchers need the ability to intelligently cluster relevant information across studies (based
on target or compound similarities, for example) and to
integrate data across therapeutic areas. chembl aims to
bridge this gap by providing broad coverage across a
diverse set of targets, organisms and bioactivity measurements reported in the scientiﬁc literature, together with a
range of user-friendly search capabilities (19).

approved drugs
in addition to literature-derived data, chembl also contains structures and annotation for food and drug
administration (fda)-approved drugs. for each drug
entry, any information about approved products (from
the fda orange book, 21) including their trade names,
administration routes, dosage information and approval
dates is included in the database. structures for novel drug
ingredients are manually assigned, and for protein therapeutics, amino-acid sequences may be included, where
available. each drug is also annotated according to the
drug type (synthetic small molecule, natural productderived small molecule, antibody, protein, oligosaccharide, oligonucleotide, inorganic etc.), whether there are
‘black box’ safety warnings associated with a product
containing that active ingredient, whether it is a known
prodrug, the earliest approval date (where known),
whether it is dosed as a deﬁned single stereoisomer or
racemic mixture, and whether it has a therapeutic application (as opposed to imaging/diagnostic agents, additives
etc.). this information allows users of the bioactivity data
to assess whether a compound of interest is an approved
drug and is therefore likely to have an advantageous
safety/pharmacokinetic proﬁle or be orally bioavailable,
for example.
data model
the most important entity types within chembl are
documents (from which the data are extracted), compounds (substances that have been tested for their bioactivity), assays (individual experiments that have been
carried out to assess bioactivity) and targets (the proteins
or systems being monitored by an assay). each extracted
document has a list of associated compound records and
assays, which are linked together by activities (i.e. the
actual endpoints measured in the assay with their types,
values and units).
since the same compound may have been tested multiple
times in different assays and publications, the compound
records are collapsed, based on structure, to form a nonredundant molecule dictionary. standard iupac
chemical identiﬁer (inchi) representation (22) is used to

determine which compounds are identical and which
should be registered with new identiﬁers. in general, the
standard inchi representation distinguishes stereoisomers
of a compound, but not tautomers. hence, stereoisomers
will be given unique identiﬁers, but tautomers will not. we
have taken the view that although a particular binding
interaction may involve a speciﬁc ionization or tautomer
state, in a biological assay, there will be interconversion
and equilibration across these forms. a smaller number of
protein therapeutics and substances with undeﬁned structures are also included in the molecule dictionary.
additional information is then associated with the
entries in this table, such as structure representations,
calculated properties, synonyms, drug information and
parent–salt relationships.
similarly, a non-redundant target dictionary stores a list
of the proteins, nucleic acids, subcellular fractions,
cell-lines, tissues and organisms that are subject to investigation. each assay is then mapped to one or more entries
in this dictionary, as described above. further information, such as protein family classiﬁcation, is also linked
to the target dictionary.
each record in the documents, assays, molecule dictionary
and target dictionary tables is assigned a unique chembl
identiﬁer, which takes the form of a ‘chembl’ preﬁx
followed immediately by an integer (e.g.  xxxd234xxx  is
the compound aspirin, chembl210 is the human b-2
adrenergic receptor target). in addition, external identiﬁers are recorded for these entities where possible. for
example, all small molecule compounds with deﬁned structures are assigned chebi identiﬁers (23) and standard
inchikeys. where data are taken from other resources,
the original identiﬁers are also retained (e.g. sids and
aids for pubchem substances and assays, het codes
for pdbe ligands). pubmed identiﬁers or digital object
identiﬁers (dois) are stored for documents (20,24).
protein targets are represented by primary accessions within the uniprot protein database (25), and organism targets
are assigned ncbi taxonomy ids and names.
data exchange
the pubchem bioassay database accepts deposited results
from many laboratories and screening centres and contains
a large quantity of data, primarily from high-throughput
screening experiments, measuring inhibition of a target by
large numbers of compounds, often at a single compound
concentration. as such, the number of data points within
pubchem is huge, but a very small proportion of these
represent compounds with dose–response measurements
(e.g. ic50, ki) of an afﬁnity likely to speciﬁcally perturb
a biological system. in contrast, due to extraction from
published pharmacology and drug discovery literature,
chembl contains a much larger proportion of active
compounds identiﬁed using dose–response assays. the
number of distinct protein targets with dose–response
measurements recorded in pubchem is also smaller (currently fewer than 700 proteins, compared with more than
4000 in chembl). however, there are also novel protein
targets in pubchem that are not currently included in
chembl. therefore, the types of data reported in

mcf-7 cells would be mapped to a chembl cell-line
target representing mcf-7. an in vitro assay measuring
inhibition of growth of mycobacterium tuberculosis would
be mapped to a chembl organism target representing
m. tuberculosis. this allows users to easily retrieve information about other assays performed on the same systems,
even though the underlying mechanism of action of the
compounds might be different. protein targets are further
classiﬁed into a manually curated family hierarchy,
according to nomenclature commonly used by drug
discovery scientists (e.g. ligand-based classiﬁcation of
g-protein-coupled receptors, division of enzymes into
proteases/kinases/phosphatases etc.), and organisms are
classiﬁed according to a simpliﬁed subset of the ncbi
taxonomic structure (20). this also allows data to be
queried at a higher level (e.g. for all protein kinases or
mycobacterium species).

nucleic acids research, 2012, vol. 40, database issue

pubchem and chembl are distinct and complementary.
to maximise the utility of the two data sets to users, we
have worked with the pubchem group to develop a data
exchange mechanism. all chembl literature-derived
assays are now included in pubchem bioassay, and a
subset of pubchem assays (conﬁrmatory and panel assays
with dose–response endpoints) have been loaded into
chembl. assays from pubchem are clearly marked,
both on the chembl interface and in the database, allowing users to easily determine where data have originated,
while beneﬁting from being able to retrieve more information through a single point of access.
similarly, compounds and binding measurements from
chembl have been integrated into bindingdb, and the
reciprocal incorporation of bindingdb data into
chembl is planned.

release 11 of the chembl database contains information extracted from more than 42 500 publications,
together with several deposited datasets, and data drawn
from other databases (table 1). in total, there are more
than 1 million distinct compound structures represented
in the database, with 5.4 million activity values from more
than 580 000 assays. these assays are mapped to 8200
targets, including 5200 proteins (of which 2388 are
human).
data access
the chembl interface
the chembl database is accessible via a simple, userfriendly interface at: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb.
this interface allows users to search for compounds, targets or assays of interest in a variety of ways.
for example, users wishing to retrieve potential tool
compounds for a target of interest can perform a
keyword search of the database using a protein name,
synonym, uniprot accession or chembl target identiﬁer
of interest. alternatively, targets can be browsed according to protein family (e.g. to retrieve all chemokine receptors), or organism (e.g. to retrieve all plasmodium
falciparum
targets).
since
the
database
only

includes protein targets for which bioactivity data are
available, users can also perform a blast search of the
chembl target dictionary with a protein sequence of
interest. this can be useful to identify closely related
proteins with activity data, even if the sequence of
interest is not represented in the database (e.g. activity
data for a mouse orthologue of a human target).
having retrieved a target, or multiple targets, of interest,
a simple drop-down menu allows users to display all
associated bioactivity data, or to ﬁlter the available data
to select activity types of interest (for example to include
only ic50 and ki measurements below a given concentration threshold, or only certain admet endpoints, see
supplementary figure 1). the resulting bioactivity table
gives details of each compound that was tested (together
with the particular salt form used in the assay), the
measured activity type, value and units, a description of
the assay, details of the target (including the organism)
and, importantly, a link to the publication from which
the data have been extracted. data from this view can
be exported as a text ﬁle or spread sheet for further
analysis.
alternatively, users may have a particular compound of
interest and wish to retrieve potency, selectivity or
admet information for this, or closely related compounds. again, users can search for compounds using a
keyword search with names/synonyms or chembl identiﬁers. however, a more effective strategy will often be to
search by compound structure. the interface provides a
choice of several different drawing tools (26), allowing
users to sketch in a structure or substructure of interest
(figure 1). a compound similarity or substructure search
of the database (implemented using the accelrys direct
oracle cartridge: http://accelrys.com/products/informatics/cheminformatics/accelrys-direct.html) can then be
carried out to retrieve chembl compounds similar to,
or containing, the input structure.
having retrieved a list of compounds of interest, a
variety of calculated properties such as molecular
weight, calculated lipophilicity (alogp, 27) and polar
surface area (28) can be viewed and ﬁltered via a graphical
display. this may be useful to restrict the set of compounds to those that are likely to have appropriate

while the chembl interface provides the functionality
required for many common use-cases, some users may
prefer to download the database and query it locally (for
use in large-scale data mining, to integrate with their own
proprietary data, or due to data security policies around
the use of chemical structures at their institutions, for
example). each release of chembl is freely available
from our ftp site in a variety of formats, including
oracle, mysql, an sd ﬁle of compound structures and
a fasta ﬁle of the target sequences, under a creative
commons attribution-sharealike 3.0 unported license
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0).
in addition, a set of restful web services is provided
(together with sample java, perl and python clients), to
allow programmatic retrieval of chembl data in xml
or json formats (see https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/ws
for more details).
finally, to allow greater interoperability of the chembl
data with molecular interaction and pathway data (e.g. for
annotation of pathways with chemical tools), a subset of
the database (compounds active in binding assays against
protein targets) is available in psi-mitab 2.5 format (30)
via psicquic web services (31).
