abstract: type ii diabetes is a heterogeneous disease where environment and genetics are important factors for the expression of the disease. the high cost for treating complications of diabetes is a burden for public health systems and governments worldwide. type ii diabetes has been causing debilitation worldwide for many decades, and a single drug that safely treats the disease has yet to be discovered.
sulfonylureas, biguanides, -glucosidase, meglitinides, dpp-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat type ii diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs. in this article we present
the pros and cons of the six classes and discuss some of the latest advances towards the development of new drugs for the treatment of
type ii diabetes.

introduction
the rising number of obese patients has become a major concern for public health systems, especially in the united states. genetic changes did not accompany the ensuing increase in food
availability. while in the past, life cycled from feast to famine,
today an abundance of food coupled with a sedentary life style has
lead to a dramatic caloric imbalance that exceeds the compensatory
capabilities of the liporegulatory systems [1]. as a result the growing overweight population in societies worldwide is facing all the
problems that come with obesity such as type ii diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. the price for having a growing obese popula

people will have the disease [6]. more than 80 % of the patients
have the non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) or
type ii diabetes. the importance of good glycemic control is
shown by the statistics. in 2002 the u.s. government spent $132
billion on diabetes treatment [7]. the high cost of the disease is a
consequence of its chronic complications. in the u.s, diabetes is the
leading cause of blindness among adults [8]. diabetes is responsible
for 43% of dialysis or transplantation. diabetic patients are 2 to 6
fold more likely to have heart disease, 2 to 4 fold more likely to
have a stroke and 15 to 40 fold more likely to undergo amputations
[9]. some clinicians consider type ii diabetes a cardiovascular
disease. research shows that the risk of coronary disease is accen-

tion is high and the worst is yet to come. it was estimated that one
in three americans babies born in 2000 will have type ii diabetes
[2], and these babies will overwhelm the health care system in the
near future. the micro and macrovascular complications caused by
the disease contribute to the deaths caused by cardiovascular problems, the leading cause of death in the u.s. once treated as a single
disease, now doctors are aware that type ii diabetes can be just the
peak of an iceberg of metabolic disorders. in this article we briefly
review the six classes of oral hypoglycemic agents available in the
u.s market and provide some information on their effects on insulin resistance and the cardiovascular system.
type ii diabetes is a chronic, multifactor, metabolic disorder
characterized by hyperglycemia as a consequence of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the liver and peripheral tissues.
in the united states 18.2 million people suffer from diabetes,
and it’s estimated that one third of them have not been diagnosed
[3]. diabetes is a major and growing public health problem
throughout the world [4]. diabetes affects an estimated 200 million
people worldwide [5]. it is estimated that by 2025, 300 million

tuated in type ii diabetes patients. support for this information is
that patients with type ii diabetes without prior myocardial infarction (mi) or acute myocardial infarction (ami) have a similar risk
of having a cardiac event as patients without type ii diabetes but
who are known to have an underlying coronary disease [10].
although type ii diabetes has existed for hundreds of years, its
primary etiology is unknown, although scientists agree that insulin
resistance is a fundamental component of the etiology of the disease. insulin resistance is a condition in which the tissue is unable
to absorb and metabolize glucose in response to insulin. several
lines of evidence link insulin resistance and type ii diabetes: presence of insulin resistance 10-20 years before the appearance of the
disease [11, 12] and insulin resistance is consistently found in patients with type ii diabetes [12, 13]. the presence of insulin resistance is the best predictor of whether or not a person will develop
type ii diabetes [11, 12]. insulin resistance can be a consequence
of genetic abnormalities in molecules involved in insulin action and
obesity.
studies have shown a close relationship between obesity and
type ii diabetes. it is known that 80% of niddm patients are
obese [14] and that loss of weight increases insulin sensitivity by
the tissues. the association of the disease with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension is known as collectively as metabolic syn© 2008 bentham science publishers ltd.

drome, and the cluster of these abnormalities greatly increases the
risk of cardiovascular diseases [15]. some of the components of
metabolic syndrome are summarized below.
although metabolic syndrome had characteristically been
prevalent in industrialized (western) countries in general, this syndrome has now inundated less developed nations, especially in the
middle east, and southeastern asia. in the u.s. around 47 million
adults have metabolic syndrome. this number continues to rise due
to the increasing number of obese youth. the cost of cardiovascular
disease for the government was around $351 billion in 2003 [16].
diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome, according to the
u.s. national cholesterol education program adult treatment
panel iii (atp iii), are defined as an individual having at least 3 of
the following 5 clinical parameters:





waist circumference  40 inches for men or 35 inches for women
triglycerides  150mg/dl
hdl cholesterol  40mg/dl for men or  50mg/dl for women
blood pressure  130/85 mm hg



fasting glucose  110 mg/dl

chart 2. parameters for the detection of the metabolic syndrome.

the five criteria selected above to identify individuals with
metabolic syndrome will not be discussed in this paper. for a comprehensive discussion of metabolic syndrome criteria as they stratify in various societies, the reader is referred to grundy and co
workers [17].
although the parameters included in the atp iii described a
person who is most likely obese and obesity is one of the leading
causes of metabolic syndrome, being thin does not prevent metabolic disease. statistics show that 18% of men and 22% of women
who are normal weight or slightly overweight have metabolic syndrome [18]. recent research has shown that the relationship between waist circumference and metabolic syndrome is variable in
different populations. thus, in 2005 the international diabetes fed-

mizuno et al.

eration (idf) proposed that thresholds be adjusted for different
ethnic groups. thresholds for americans remain the same as the
one define by the atp iii panel, but thresholds for groups with a
propensity for insulin resistance as asian americans are lower [17].
a sedentary lifestyle, coupled with a high fat diet (fast food), are
part of the environmental factors that lead to development of the set
of disorders described in chart 1. environment plays an important
role in the development of metabolic disorders. for example, the
pima indians of arizona have a high caloric intake and live a sedentary lifestyle, which has resulted in obesity and a high occurrence
of type ii diabetes, while the pima indians who live in the mountains of mexico have a low caloric intake and an intensely active
lifestyle, which has resulted in a low incidence of obesity and type
ii diabetes [19]. studies have revealed that age is an important factor. the probability of developing metabolic syndrome increases
from 25% in the 30s to 40% in the 60s [18]. among the abnormalities of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance is what concerns
doctors the most.
in the united states there are six classes of oral agents available
to improve glycemic control in type ii diabetic patients (fig. 1)
[20]. sulfonylureas, biguanides, -glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides, dpp-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are used as monotherapy, but combined therapy is also common and has proven to be
equally effective. the advantages of having six different classes of
drugs to treat one disease are undeniable. flexibility is one major
advantage since therapy can be adjusted to the patient. however,
studies have shown that most of the oral hypoglycemic agents can
not maintain normal levels of blood glucose for an extended period
of time. in addition, thiazolidinediones and biguanides are the two
classes that target insulin resistance, a major feature of type ii
diabetes.
obesity and insulin resistance
adipocytes are one of the most sensitive cells in response to the
presence of insulin. insulin promotes triglyceride storage in adipo-

cytes by several mechanisms, including 1) fostering the maturation
of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes, 2) stimulating glucose transport
and triglyceride synthesis in mature adipocytes, and 3) inhibiting
lipolysis [21]. thus insulin stimulates the body to store fat, and
tissues with too much fat (as in an obese person) produce less insulin receptors and are more resistant to insulin. to compensate for
the decreased action of insulin, the pancreas will produce and release more insulin into circulation which will store more fat, creating a vicious cycle. the cycle will be active until the -cells die
from exhaustion.
large epidemiological studies show that insulin resistance is
probably related to the content of body fat. support for this information comes from the fact that the risk of insulin resistance increases from the very lean to the very obese, clearly suggesting that
the amount of body fat has an effect on insulin resistance [21]. publications over the past 15 years indicate that more important than
obesity is the type of fat accumulated in the body. technologically
advanced instruments such as computerized tomography, made
possible the study of the importance of regional adipose accumulation in the development of type ii diabetes and cardiovascular
diseases [22-25]. studies concluded that visceral fat located in the
upper body is the most dangerous. excess visceral fat is associated
with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance
in the presence or absence of obesity [26-29]. different from subcutaneous fat, visceral fat is more easily mobilized and richer in tumor
necrosis factor (tnf)-, one of the main cytokines involved in
insulin resistance. tnf- belongs to a class of cytokines released
by adipose tissue known as adipokines. tnf- is highly expressed
table 1.

in the enlarged adipose tissue from all rodent models as well as
obese humans [30-32]. the cytokine decreased insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake both in vivo and in adipose cells in vitro [33, 34].
the mechanism by which tnf- stimulates insulin resistance is
related to its ability to inhibit the activity of the  xxxg1194xxx 
 xxxg2198xxx , since absence of tnf- or its action in obese animals increases the activity of the  xxxg1194xxx  [33].
studies have shown that insulin resistance is a consequence of
obesity and has more than one component. an example of this is
the role that glucose transport plays in the development of insulin
resistance [35-37]. thus, a reduced number of glucose transporters
may contribute to the insulin resistance seen in type ii diabetic
patients.  xxxg2135xxx  is the principal glucose transporter in the body,
and experiments have shown that the number of transporters is
reduced in the adipose tissue of animals with obesity and type ii
diabetes [37] and in humans with type ii diabetes [38-41]. similar
expression of  xxxg2135xxx  was found in adipose tissue of obese patients with and without type ii diabetes but with a similar body
mass index [42]. moreover, there is a negative correlation between
abdominal fat accumulation and the number of  xxxg2135xxx  suggesting
that obesity may be responsible for the decreased expression of
 xxxg2135xxx  in adipocyte tissue of type 2 diabetic individuals.
treatment strategies
patients with a1c of 7% should be advised to initiate or

trition and a sedentary lifestyle. thus, when lifestyle changes are
insufficient to control glucose levels, patients are evaluated for oral
hypoglycemic agents. usually treatment starts with monotherapy
using metformin or a secretagogue. if glycemic control is not
achieved, a second class of drugs is introduced. the most common
combination is sulfonylurea and metformin, sulfonylurea and alphaglucosidase inhibitors, and sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones
(tzd)s. if glycemic levels are still uncontrolled, a third class is
introduced, or an intermediate or long acting basal insulin is added,
the patient switches to insulin or consults a diabetes specialist team
[4].
after 1995 there has been rapid development of new classes of
anti-diabetic agents, but until 1995, sulfonylureas were the only
class of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat type ii diabetes
in the u.s. more than 50% of patients were treated only with sulfonylurea, 40% were treated with insulin, and a small percentage
was treated with a combination of sulfonylureas and insulin [4].
there are six classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs currently
available on the u.s. market for the treatment of type ii diabetes
(table 1).
insulin was the first therapeutic agent used for the treatment of
diabetes. it was discovered in the 1920s and is still utilized in the
therapy of type ii diabetes, either alone, or more often in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs. in 1939 fda (food and drug
administration) started approving insulin products. since its approval, bovine, porcine and  xxxd2364xxx  are available for diabetes
treatment. however, in 1999, bovine-derived insulin was suspended
for clinical use in the u.s due to concerns about the transmission of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. current insulin preparations are
shown in table 2 [4]. besides the several classes of therapeutic
agents available today, none can regulate blood glucose levels as
well as insulin. however in patients with type ii diabetes in which
insulin resistance is present, hyperglycemia is only overcome with
high levels of insulin. such levels could cause death of the patient
due to hypoglycemia resulting from exercise or missing a meal.

oral hypoglycemic agents
sulfonylureas
sulfonylureas (fig. 2) were introduced in the 1950s and have
been the main class of antidiabetic drugs used for type ii diabetes
treatment. sulfonylureas exhibit their hypoglycemic action by
stimulating insulin secretion from -cells [44]. treatment with sulfonylureas is only effective in patients who do not lack endogenous
insulin. insulin release is a result of the depolarization of -cells
due to enhanced calcium flux caused by the interaction between the
sulfonylurea and -cell membranes [45]. because of their long halflife and increased risk of hypoglycemia, which is difficult to reverse
and usually requires hospitalization, prescription of the first generation of sulfonylureas ( xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd65xxx ,  xxxd3392xxx , and
 xxxd1678xxx ) is no longer recommended in the u.s. whereas,
second generation, including  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx 
[46] are more potent on a mg/mg basis, patients treated with these
sulfonylureas had their insulin levels reduced to pretreatment levels.
these sulfonylureas are used more often to control glucose levels
[47-49].
extrapancreatic effects of sulfonylureas may also contribute to
their therapeutic effects. sulfonylureas increase the number of insulin receptors on hepatic membranes of mice [50] and fibroblasts
[51]. the increase in the number of insulin receptors may be related
to their ability to inhibit transglutaminase, an enzyme involved in
receptor-mediated endocytosis of insulin [52]. in 1984, in an 18
month study involving 17 niddm patients, kolterman concluded
that  xxxd2215xxx  increases insulin secretion, increases adipocyte
insulin binding after 18 months, enhances the peripheral effect of
insulin and reduces basal glucose output from the liver [53]. these
different physiological effects combined add to the hypoglycemic
activity of this class of drug. it has been proposed that sulfonylureas
may decrease insulin resistance [54, 55]. of particular interest is the
recent finding that several sulfonylureas and glinides exhibit
ppar agonistic activity at concentrations used during pharmacological treatment. when tested for ppar activation,  xxxd2203xxx 
induced the transcriptional activity of the receptor in hek 293
cells, was shown to bind directly to ppar in a competitive manner
to rosiglitazone, and induced adipose differentiation of 3t3-f442a
cells.  xxxd2215xxx  showed similar effects towards ppar, and
both drugs act as ppar agonists whose potencies were 16-25% of
pioglitazone [56]. the most active compound was  xxxd2205xxx  which
showed the same potency as pioglitazone at inducing ppar target
gene expression [57]. considering that insulin resistance is the major component in the development of type ii diabetes, this effect
has a positive impact on the treatment of the disease. sulfonylureas
are less expensive compared with other oral hypoglycemic agents
and are the first choice for early onset diabetes or for patients that
have contraindications for other hypoglycemic agents [16]. therapeutic effects are reached with half of the maximal recommended
dose for these drugs, and sulfonylureas do not affect lipid levels or
blood pressure. the efficacy of these drugs has been recognized for
years, and it decreases a1c between 1-2% [58]. however, sulfonylurea is ineffective in 10-20% of the niddm patients [59]. the
major adverse effect is hypoglycemia [60], but the degree depends
on the agent, and it may be based on receptor binding profiles.  xxxd2215xxx , the agent with the higher incidence of hypoglycemia [58,
61, 62] showed an increased duration of binding to the receptor
resulting in fasting hyperinsulinemia. on the other hand, this rate of
hyperinsulinemia is not seen with other agents in this class. another
explanation for hypoglycemia is the greater suppression of hepatic
glucose production caused by this  xxxd2215xxx  [63]. hypoglycemia
occurs in about 2 to 4% of the patients, and because elderly are
more susceptible to hypoglycemia [62, 64-66], short acting sulfonylurea is recommended. the long half life of  xxxd1678xxx  may
result in accumulation leading to precipitous hypoglycemia, especially in elders [67]. another well known side effect is weight gain.

it has been reported that patients gain around 2kg to 5kg upon initiation of treatment with sulfonylureas. given the association of
obesity and insulin resistance, this side effect is problematic, mainly
in a group that is already overweight [55, 60, 68, 69]. considering
the connection between hyperinsulinemia and cardiovascular disease, the university groups diabetes program (ugdp) study suggested that sulfonylureas use may increase cardiovascular events
[58] and morbidity [70, 71]. however the study has been widely
criticized [72, 73] and the united kingdom prospective diabetes
study (ukpds) results demonstrated no increased incidence of
coronary artery disease in patients undergoing treatment with sulfonylureas [60].
meglitinides
meglitinides (fig. 3) are known as non-sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues.  xxxd3098xxx  was the first in this class to be introduced
onto the market in 1998, followed by  xxxd2702xxx  in 2001. these
agents stimulate release of insulin from the -cell by binding to a
different receptor than sulfonylureas. meglitinides promote insulin
release by inhibiting potassium efflux via closure of atp-regulated
k+ channels [74, 75]. this result in depolarization of the cell and
opening of voltage-dependent ca++ channels, which increases influx
of calcium into the -cell and releases insulin [74]. the efficacy of
 xxxd3098xxx  is similar to sulfonylureas [76, 77], decreasing the a1c
value by 1.7% to 1.8% [78, 79]. when compared to  xxxd2215xxx ,
 xxxd3098xxx  showed a faster and greater increase in plasma insulin
levels leading to a faster decrease in glycemic levels [80, 81].  xxxd3098xxx  stimulates insulin release in a glucose sensitive manner.
the delivery of insulin at the beginning of a meal rapidly inhibits
hepatic production, and because of the short action, less insulin is

released decreasing the risk of hypoglycemia during the postprandial phase [82]. because less insulin is released hyperinsulinemia is decreased, and there are no risks of cardiovascular failures
reported in treatments with glinides. the meal-related dose allows
patients to have a flexible meal schedule without the risk of hypoglycemia. elderly patients and those with renal insufficiency are
good patients for this medicine since 90% of  xxxd3098xxx  is recovered in the feces. glinides have no effect on plasma lipid levels. a
common adverse effect is hypoglycemia due to its fast onset of
action. weight gain (5-6 lbs) [83] is a critical side effect considering this group of patients. another disadvantage of glinides is the
multiple daily doses required.
 xxxd3098xxx  and  xxxd2702xxx  also bind to ppar and displace
the standard ligand in the competitor binding assay. among the
tested glinides,  xxxd3098xxx  showed the best results for activation of
ppar in a cell-based transactivation assay, and  xxxd2702xxx  significantly enhanced ppar induced target gene expression [57].
the degrees to which these agents activate ppar may, in part,
explain differences in their efficacy and safety profiles. this unique
group of agents may provide insight into the design and development of novel antidiabetic drugs, which could potentially enhance
both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.
biguanides
the biguanides (fig. 4) were also introduced in the late 1950s.
the only available drug in the u.s belonging to this class is metformin; an active compound found in french lilacs and has been
used as a traditional medicine for years in europe. the precise
mechanism of action of biguanides is not completely understood.

fig. (4). chemical structures of biguanides.

however metformin shows hypoglycemic effects by decreasing
hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhancing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues [84]. the latter effect is related to improved insulin
sensitivity in the muscles associated with reduction of circulating
free fatty acid levels [85, 86]. clinical trial reports showed that
metformin therapy decreases the a1c value by 1.5 to 2%. thus,
metformin and sulfonylureas are equally effective in reducing a1c
in type ii diabetes patients. this class of drugs appears to act at
several sites as seen by the different physiological effects when
biguanides are administered including: increased peripheral glucose
utilization [87], decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis [88] and decreased intestinal glucose absorption [89].
unlike sulfonylureas, the hypoglycemic effect of biguanides is
independent from the insulin concentration in the body. the advantages of metformin for the treatment of type ii diabetes itself and
as part of metabolic syndrome are many. metformin is the only oral
hypoglycemic agent to reduce macrovascular complications in a
large scale prospective study--the ukpds [90]. the improved cardiovascular risk factor may be related to its mechanism of action.
different from sulfonylureas that improve glycemic control through
stimulation of insulin release by the  cells, metformin actually
enhances insulin action [58], which provides a cardiovascular advantage. recent studies also reported improvement of endothelial
function [91]. considering the deleterious contribution of dyslipidemia to cardiovascular complications, metformin reduces triglyceride and ldl levels by 10% to 15% [92-96] and also reduces
plasma free fatty acid levels and free fatty acid oxidation [95-97].
hdl cholesterol remains unchanged or slightly increases under
metformin treatment [92, 93, 95, 96, 98, 99]. recently, reports
show that the beneficial lipid lowering effect of metformin is mediated through activation of amp-activated protein kinase (ampk).
ampk is a major cellular regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism
and activation by metformin resulted in stimulation of fatty acid
oxidation and suppression of lipogenic enzymes. studies have
shown that ampk activation is required for inhibition of hepatic
gluconeogenesis by metformin [100]. an important advantage of
metformin is the appetite-suppressive action that promotes weight
loss [58]. unlike other hypoglycemic agents that promote weight
gain, metformin does not increase insulin resistance in patients with
type ii diabetes. a very serious, but rare, side effect of metformin
is lactic acidosis. side effects occur in 20-30% of patients and include: abdominal discomfort and diarrhea [94, 101], but this problem can be solved with accommodation of the patient to the therapy

or by slowing titration. less than 4% to 5% of patients are unable to
tolerate metformin therapy. monotherapy of metformin does not
cause hypoglycemia unless used in combination with sulfonylurea.
in 1977 the use of  xxxd2903xxx  was suspended in many countries due to its association with fatal lactic acidosis [5]. this fact
contributed to the late approval of biguanides in the usa where
metformin was launched only in 1995. the side effects of biguanides occur in about 60% of patients [102]. lactic acidosis is not
only a result of the drug but also from the accumulation of the drug
when administered to patients with renal insufficiency [103].
in 1957 the ugdp began a study to evaluate the two available
classes (sulfonylureas and biguanides) of oral hypoglycemic agents.
the study revealed that glucose levels were controlled only in the
group treated with insulin, and the risk of cardiovascular death was
twice among patients treated with  xxxd2903xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx  than
those patients treated with insulin or placebo [102]. studies done by
the biometric society [104] concluded that in this case, the baseline
differences among the groups (age, blood glucose, cardiovascular
risk factors and use of other drugs), could not account for the increase in cardiovascular deaths. additional support was revealed by
the study of 2,500 patients at the joslin clinic [105]. patients
treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 5 years have
increased death rates. in a study with 184 patients, those treated
with oral hypoglycemic agents had an increased frequency of myocardial infarction (19.7%) compared with those treated with diet
(9.5%) [106]. besides the voluminous data available, opinion is still
divided regarding the efficacy of the use of sulfonylureas and
biguanides. while sulfonylureas have continued to grow after the
ugdp study, the same can not be said about biguanides. the irreversible lactic acidosis of patients treated with biguanides hindered
the clinical use of this class of drugs. to address the serious effects
of the use of biguanides, some criteria were defined to increase the
safety of its use [107]. thus, biguanides are not recommended for:
1) patients over 60 years, 2) use in the presence of accompanying
cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease or infections, 3) conditions
that can accumulate lactate (shock states, ketoacidosis, surgery,
alcoholism etc).
- glucosidase inhibitors
acarbose (fig. 5), an -glucosidase inhibitor, was introduced in
1996. it is a pseudotetrasaccharide with a maltose unit linked to an
acarviosine unit in the active part of the molecule. the acarviosine

moiety has a nitrogen linkage that is responsible for the high affinity towards the -glucosidase [108]. this -glucosidase inhibitor
competes with oligosaccharides for the catalytic enzymes [109,
110]. acarbose inhibits the breakdown of oligosaccharides and
disaccharides into monosaccharides.
the inhibition of these enzymes slows absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine, due to a reduced postprandial rise in
blood glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels [74, 111]. delay in the
absorption of glucose is advantageous because it allows the -cells
time to increase insulin secretion thus reducing the entry of glucose
into the circulation. -glucosidase inhibitors do not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. acarbose is less effective than
sulfonylureas and metformin, reducing a1c by only 0.7-1% [112118]. they are effective either as monotherapy or in combination
with other oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. the advantage of
-glucosidase inhibitors is that they act locally in the intestine,
without a systemic effect. for this reason acarbose is very suitable
for use in elderly diabetic patients. these agents do not cause
weight gain or hypoglycemia. in addition, a study using these
agents showed a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension [119]. - glucosidase inhibitors showed a modest decrease
in plasma triglyceride levels [112, 116].
the cost of -glucosidase inhibitors is about twice that of sulfonylureas but less than metformin [16]. patients should be advised
to take pure glucose to treat low blood sugar since these agents
inhibit catalysis of oligosaccharides. adverse effects occur in
around 30% of patients. the most common are flatulence, diarrhea
and abdominal pain. these sides effects are due to intracolonic
fermentation of carbohydrates that are not absorbed in the small
bowel, which results in production of gas [108]. these side effects
are responsible for therapy discontinuation by 25-45% of patients
[119, 120]. sides effects can be reduced by lowering the doses [75],
administration with food (acarbose must be taken with the first
portion of food to be effective) and individual accommodation with
the therapy [121]. acarbose, when administered in combination
with sulfonylurea or diet, was shown to improve glycemic control
in niddm patients [122].
the benefits of sulfonylureas, metformin, acarbose, insulin and
meglitinides in the treatment of type ii diabetes are well documented. however these classes of drugs have a modest contribution
against the progression of the disease and its chronic vascular complications [123-125]. the ukpds reported that the glucose levels
in 50% of the drug-treated type ii diabetes patients were poorly
controlled after 6 years of therapy [123]. it is clear that there is a
need for development of new classes of antihyperglycemic agents,
used as monotherapy or in combination with the existing oral hypoglycemics for treatment of type ii diabetes.
thiazolidinediones
the antihyperglycemic potential of thiazolidinediones (tzds)
was discovered in the early 1980s (table 3). the first drug belonging to this class was ciglitazone, discovered by takeda during the
efforts of the company to synthesize a triglyceride-lowering agent
based on  xxxd1724xxx . ciglitazone enhances insulin action without
stimulating insulin secretion [126]. troglitazone followed in 1988

(sankyo). incorporated into the chemical structure was an tocopherol moiety that researchers believed would add to the molecule a lipid peroxide-lowering activity that seems to be high in diabetic patients [127, 128]. in 1997, troglitazone was launched in the
u.s market to treat type ii diabetes, but in 2000 it was voluntarily
removed from the market due to its association with liver toxicity
[129, 130].
rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were launched in 1999. tzds
are insulin sensitizer agents that decrease plasma glucose, insulin,
and triglyceride levels considerably in ob/ob mouse, db/db mouse,
kk mouse, and zucker fat rats [126, 131]. the hypoglycemic effects of tzds are not limited to genetically generate diabetic animals only.
anti-hyperglycemic activity is seen also in diet-induced animal
models of insulin resistance (fructose fat rat [132] and fat fed rat
[133, 134]). these data suggest that tzds improve insulin sensitivity regardless of the origin of the disease. tzds are peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor gamma (ppar) agonists. they
reduce plasma triclycerides and increase hdl cholesterol levels
[135-138]. however ldl levels tend to rise under tzd therapy
[135, 136, 139] but to a larger size that is less atherogenic.
binding of tzds into ppar causes a conformational change
in the ppar-rxr complex which activates a co-receptor that
leads to transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. ppar activation by tzds improves insulin sensitivity
and insulin resistance which results in increased uptake of glucose
in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue and reduction
of liver glucose output (fig. 6) [16, 21, 90, 140-143]. the decreased
gluconeogenesis in the liver seen during activation of ppar by
tzds is due to a decrease in activity of fructose-1,6-biphosphatase
[144, 145]. studies support that tzds inhibit gluconeogenesis and
glucogenolysis by activating camp phosphodiesterases and by
inhibiting ca++ influx [146]. in vitro studies have demonstrated that
the increased glucose transport in adipocytes and skeletal muscle
has been attributed to increased production of glucose transporters
 xxxg2133xxx  and  xxxg2135xxx  and translocation of  xxxg2135xxx  into the plasma
membrane [147]. tzds also increase lipogenesis and fatty acid
uptake in adipocytes and promote the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. all these effects work together for the
antihyperglycemic activity presented by tzds.
glitazones modestly reduce plasma glucose levels and decrease
a1c by 0.5-1.4%. up to 12 weeks of treatment with tzds are required to achieve therapeutic effects, enforcing the hypothesis that
changes in gene transcription are part of the mechanisms of these
agents. a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (fpg) is not seen for 2
or 4 weeks and, patients that do not respond to the treatment within
8 weeks should have their dose increased.
results from a diabetes outcome progression trial (adopt)
showed that tzds were more efficient in controlling glycemic levels than others agents. the risk of monotherapy failure after 5 years
of treatment was 32% lower for rosiglitazone versus metformin and
63% lower for rosiglitazone versus  xxxd2215xxx  [148].
the most severe adverse effect is hepatoxicity [130], but it is
not clear whether the hepatoxicity is mediated by ppar activation
or by a particular mechanism of troglitazone because neither

pioglitazone or rosiglitazone have shown liver toxicity. intense
liver function monitoring has to be done periodically while patients
undergo treatment with tzds. anemia, weight gain, and edema are
the major complications regarding this class of drugs. weight gain
and edema are very critical side effects in this particular group of
patients. weight gain is an undesirable effect because of the association between obesity and insulin resistance, and it worsens the

condition of an already obese group. however adiposity occurs
with redistribution of fat from visceral to subcutaneous which is
less deleterious than visceral associated with insulin resistance.
edema can promote heart failure. research has discovered some
potential pathophysiological causes for the ppar activation dependent edema: vasodilatation, increased renal sodium absorption,
increased plasma volume and reflex sympathetic activation [149].

reviews http://www.annualreviews.org".

insulin has vasodilator activities but also stimulates the production
of  xxxg674xxx , a potent vasoconstrictor [150]. activation of
ppar inhibits the expression of  xxxg674xxx  genes, thus the
vasodilator effect of insulin is pronounced, and the body becomes
more susceptible to fluid retention and edema. however this hypothesis needs to be proven. recently it was discovered in mice that
a ppar dependent pathway in the regulation of sodium transport
in the collecting ducts that underlies tzds induced fluid retention.
when mice with collecting ducts knocked out of ppar was generated it was observed that these animals were resistant to rosiglitazone-induced increases in body weight and plasma fluid expansion
[151]. the deletion of the receptor in collecting ducts decreased
renal na+ avidity, but when collecting ducts are treated with tzds
it increases amiloride-sensitive na+ absorption through a ppar
dependent pathway, which could be a potential cause for thiazolidinedione-induced fluid retention [152]. the anemia issue is
unclear, and may to some extent be delusional because tzd full
agonists can cause up to a 15% intravascular expansion. around
20% to 25% of patients do not respond to tzd treatment due to
insufficient levels of insulin. the cost of these drugs is considerably
higher when compared with other available oral hypoglycemic
agents.
the cardiovascular safety profile of tzds is very controversial.
while there is some evidence that supports the cardiovascular
safety of this class of drugs, others raised concerns regarding the
increased risk of cardiovascular diseases presented by tzds. a
recent meta-analysis done by nissen et al. [153] showed an increased risk of myocardial infarction and deaths from cardiovascular diseases in patients treated with rosiglitazone compared to a
control group. in addition, muraglitazar, a dual ppar/ agonist
was not approved by the fda due to its cardiovascular safety profile. patients treated with muraglitazar presented increased myocardial infarction during phases 2 and 3 of clinical trials [154]. development of the drug was discontinued by the manufacturer. myocar-

dial infarction, strokes and deaths occurred in 1.47% of the muraglitazar treated group versus 0.67% of the control group [154].
the meta-analysis had important limitations mentioned by the
author. the trial was not originally designed to explore the cardiovascular outcomes, many of the trials were small and short term,
and the confidence intervals for the odds ratios for myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular diseases were wide. besides,
a meta-analysis is less convincing than a large prospective trial
designed specifically to explore the cardiovascular outcome. despite the limitations, the meta-analysis raised concerns for the use
of thiazolidinediones.
in response to the concerns raised by the meta-analysis, the
rosiglitazone evaluated for cardiac outcomes and regulation of
glycemia in diabetes (record) study has published an interim
analysis. record is a long term, multicenter, randomized, open
label [155] designed to assess the cardiovascular outcomes in type
ii diabetes patients treated with rosiglitazone plus metformin or
sulfonylureas [156] with outcomes in patients treated with metformin plus sulfonylureas. although the record study is ongoing, thus having limited statistical power, the authors felt the need
to publish interim data in regard to the recent safety concerns involving rosiglitazone. record results for acute myocardial infarction showed that the difference between the rosiglitazone group
and the control group was not statistically significant. for deaths
from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke, the
rosiglitazone group did not differ significantly from the control
group [156]. however, patients in the rosiglitazone group presented
a higher risk of congestive heart failure compare to the control
group. the record study concluded that there was no evidence
of any increased mortality from any cause in patients treated with
rosiglitazone. the data is inconclusive regarding whether treatment
with rosiglitazone leads to a higher risk of myocardial infarction
compared to the control group.

70 current medicinal chemistry, 2008 vol. 15, no. 1

the proactive (prospective pioglitazone clinical trial in
macrovascular events) study results revealed that in relevance to
the primary end point that include coronary and peripheral vascular
events there was a non-statistically significant 10% reduction in the
hazard ratio. however pioglitazone reduced the composite of all
case mortality, non fatal myocardial infarction, and strokes in patients with type ii diabetes who had a high risk for macrovascular
events [157].
the advantage of this class of drugs is their mechanism of action. they decrease glucose levels by increasing insulin sensitivity
by the peripheral tissues. this treats the problem of insulin resistance, a condition that plays a big role in the pathogenesis of type
ii diabetes. for this reason tzds differs from other oral hypoglycemics and serves as an advancement in the treatment of type ii
diabetes.
unfortunately the well known side effects of full agonists such
as the glitazones aggravate the condition of a diabetic patient. in an
attempt to eliminate the weight gain caused by tzds, researchers
have been putting effort into the development of ppar/ dual
agonists. fibrates, a known class of ppar agonists, decrease serum triglyceride levels, increase hdl levels, and improve glucose
tolerance in type ii diabetes [158, 159]. the idea of a ppar/
agonist is very attractive because the combined activity of a dual
agonist may reduce weight gain associated with ppar activation
through the simultaneous stimulation of lipid oxidation and decreased adiposity seen when ppar is activated. thus  xxxd3072xxx ,
muraglitazar and tesaglitazar were developed, among others. although these compounds showed ppar and  activity by lowering
plasma triglycerides and cholesterol in high cholesterol fed rats and
by improving insulin resistance respectively, no biological data is
available on weight gain caused by these compounds.
over the last several years the search has shifted towards partial
ppar agonists/antagonists, also termed selective ppar modulators (spparms). research shows that analogous to full agonists,
partial agonists also have the ability to improve insulin resistance.
a moderate reduction in ppar activity by heterozygous ppar
deficiency decreases the triglycerides (tg) content of white adipose
tissue (wat), skeletal muscle, and liver due to increased leptin
expression and an increase in fatty acid combustion and a decrease
in lipogenesis, ameliorating high fatty diet-induced obesity and
insulin resistance [160]. the search for partial agonists was also
supported by the relationship seen among ppar activity, insulin
sensitivity and adipogenesis. the correlation between insulin sensitivity and ppar activity is bell-shaped [161], while adipogenesis
and ppar activity have a linear correlation. therefore insulin
sensitization reaches its maximum at suboptimal activation of
ppar, while adipogenesis is greatest at the highest ppar activity. based on this correlation, modulation of ppar rather than
activating it may be more efficient for the treatment of metabolic
disorders like type ii diabetes.
the concept of spparms is based on the differential recruitment of cofactors (coactivators or corepressors), to the receptor
resulting in tissue and promoter-selective expression of a favorable
panel of target genes [161, 162]. coactivators can be beneficial or
adverse factors regarding their insulin sensitizing (e.g.  xxxg1510xxx   xxxg2198xxx ) versus pro-adipogenic (e.g.  xxxg1511xxx / xxxg1511xxx ) actions [161-168].
some compounds have already been reported in the literature as
spparms. pa-082 [169] displayed a partial agonism in biochemical and cell-based transactivation assays. it also antagonized
rosiglitazone-driven transactivation and triglycerides accumulation
of c3h10t1/2 cells. f- xxxd2460xxx  [170] improved insulin sensitivity in
several models of diabetic mice and has low adipogenic effects.
berger et al. [171]reported a non tzd partial agonist (ntzdpa)
that decreased hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia with reduced
weight gain and adipose depot size. thus, spparms hold the

hope to disconnect insulin sensitivity from triglyceride storage and
develop a drug with safer profiles.
dpp-4 inhibitors
the last class of oral antihyperglycemic drugs to be introduced
onto the market was the dpp-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors.
dpp-4 is a proline specific dipeptidyl aminopeptidase [172, 173]
widely expressed in many tissues such as the liver, lung, kidney,
intestinal brush border membranes, lymphocytes, and endothelial
cells [174, 175]. this enzyme regulates the levels of several gastrointestinal hormones in the body including glucagon-like peptide
(glp-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip).
glp-1 has several beneficial effects for blood glucose control such
as stimulation of insulin secretion [176], inhibition of glucagon
secretion [177, 178], and delaying gastric emptying [179]. however
glp-1 is rapidly degraded by dpp-4. these findings resulted in a
race among several companies to identify glp-1 analogs and  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors. thus, sitagliptin (fig. 7), the first dpp-4 inhibitor was
discovered by merck and was approved in 2006 for the treatment of
type ii diabetes. sitagliptin is highly selective (>2,600 fold over
dpp-8 or dpp-9 [180]. results of a1c changes from the end of
phase iii trials showed that therapy with 100 mg of sitagliptin once
a day were -0.6% in the 18 week trial [181] and -0.79% in the 24
week trial [182]. advantages of this class of drugs are: 1) glp-1
stimulates insulin release in a dose-dependent manner decreasing
the risk of hypoglycemia, 2) absence of weight gain [183] and 3)
restoration of  cell function through stimulation of cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [184, 185]. the effect of sitagliptin
on insulin resistance was inconclusive during clinical trials. while
used as monotherapy [181, 182] or in combination with pioglitazone [186] it did not improve insulin resistance. nevertheless when
it was administered with metformin it significantly improved insulin resistance [187]. cardiovascular effects were not available. no
serious adverse effects have been seen in patients taking sitagliptin
despite the large number of dpp-4 substrates [188-190]. in phase
iii trials nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections occurred in 5.2% and 6.3% of patients, respectively. headache occurred in 5.1% in the combination therapy with pioglitazone[191].
clinical trial data revealed that sitagliptin is well tolerated at doses
of 100mg once daily either as monotherapy or in combination with
metformin and pioglitazone without hypoglycemia and weight gain
[192]. clinical trials are ongoing to further characterize the efficacy
and safety of sitagliptin in patients with type ii diabetes [193].

combination therapy
because type ii diabetes is a progressive disease, long term
glycemic control cannot be maintained, and patients will require
addition of different agents. research shows that in 50% of patients, glycemic control cannot be achieved with monotherapy after
3 years, and after 9 years this number decreases to 25% [194]. in
addition, only a very small percentage of patients can achieve normal blood glucose levels with monotherapy using agents with lower
hypoglycemic effects like tzds and acarbose. clinical trials of
each combination therapy have demonstrated an additive reduction
of a1c.
the most common combination is sulfonylurea plus metformin.
both, the addition of sulfonylurea to metformin therapy [195, 196]
or addition of metformin to sulfonylurea therapy [196, 197] have

type 2 diabetes and oral antihyperglycemic drugs

demonstrated an additive and similar glucose-lowering effect. two
fixed dose formulations with tzds/metformin have recently been
approved in u.s. rosiglitazone/metformin (avandamet [198])
showed superior a1c and fasting plasma glucose lowering effects
than metformin monotherapy in a 24 week, double blind study.
most frequent side effects were upper respiratory tract infections,
diarrhea and headache [198]. pioglitazone/metformin (actoplus
met [199]) was more effective for glycemic and lipid control than
metformin plus placebo. avandamet and  xxxd2958xxx  had
similar hypoglycemic efficacy in a 12 month trial.  xxxd2958xxx 
side effects included edema and headache [199]. a triple combination therapy study confirmed that addition of rosiglitazone to
 xxxd2203xxx  and metformin improved glycemic control [200], but it
has not been officially approved by the fda. if combination therapy fails to attain glycemic control, insulin should be used as monotherapy [201] or in combination with oral hypoglycemic agents
[141, 202].
new alternatives
several new alternatives are being pursued as potentials for the
development of new classes of hypoglycemic agents. as discussed
earlier in this paper the effects of glp-1 are very beneficial, however this peptide is rapidly degraded by dpp-4. thus alternatively
to inhibition of dpp-4, development of dpp-4 resistant glp-1
analogs is also a possible approach. two drugs belonging to this
class are available in the market to treat type ii diabetes. exenatide, a peptide isolated from lizard venom [203] was approved
by the fda in april, 2005. the half life of this drug is around 3
hours, and increased post-prandial insulin and decreased glucagon
levels were detected in patients undergoing treatment with exenatide. a1c was reduced by 0.78% with no additional effect on
hypoglycemia, while weight loss of approximately 2.8 kg occurred.
common side effects included nausea, vomiting or diarrhea [204206].
 xxxd2495xxx  shares 97% sequence analogy with native glp-1
but is a synthetic analog with a half life of about 10-14 hours after
subcutaneous injection [207, 208]. it decreases fasting and postprandial glucose, reduces a1c by 1.75% and stimulates modest
weight loss [209, 210]. gastrointestinal side effects were common.
lee et al. [211] found a potent anthraquinone natural product
that greatly inhibits (ic50= 5nm) hepatic-6-phosphatase translocase
( xxxd1292xxx  t1). several others natural products have been identified as
specific  xxxd1292xxx  t1 inhibitors [212-214]. glucose-6-phosphate is a
common intermediate for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and
it is hydrolyzed to glucose and phosphate in the liver by the g6pase
complex. inhibition of this enzyme resulted in a decrease in the rate
of glucose release by hepatocytes and inhibited 40% of the glucagon’s stimulated glucose production [211].
development of glycogen phosphorylase (gp) inhibitors are
also being sought as therapeutics for type ii diabetes. gp is the
main regulatory enzyme in the liver responsible for the control of
glucose levels. gp inhibitors could suppress glucose production
from glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis [215-217]. the best non
glucose derived inhibitor of this enzyme is cp526423 (ic50= 6nm)
from pfizer [218]. some glucose analogs and iminosugar are also
available and showed good glycogenolysis inhibitory effects [219,
220].
the hypothesis that inhibition of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 could decrease glucose production has been explored.
glucocorticoids oppose the insulin action in peripheral tissues and
increase hepatic glucose output. thus, inhibition of this enzyme
constitutes a potential target for glucose control in diabetic patients.
in an experiment where bvt.2733, a selective inhibitor of 11hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 was given to hyperglycemic
kkay mice, the levels of blood glucose and serum insulin were
lowered [221].

current medicinal chemistry, 2008 vol. 15, no. 1

71

protein  xxxg1893xxx  ( xxxg1893xxx ) also emerged as a
target in 2000. since then several companies have developed programs for the discovery of  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  inhibitors.
the inhibitors of  xxxg1893xxx  increase insulin sensitivity by blocking the
phosphatase actions leading to an enhanced phosphorylation state
of the insulin receptors kinase. two independent studies revealed
that  xxxg1893xxx  knockout mice presented improved glycemic control,
enhanced insulin sensitivity and resistance to weight gain on a high
fat diet [222, 223]. ptb1b inhibitors lowered blood glucose levels
when administered to kkay mice [224]. despite the discovery of
several inhibitors, a compound with good potency and pharmacokinetic profiles remains to be discovered.
in summary, it is clear that there is urgency for the discovery of
a new class of drugs for the treatment of type ii diabetes. the six
classes available today to treat the disease have limitations that
need to be overcome, and sitagliptin is too new to know the long
term safety profiles of this drug. sitagliptin, introduced in the market in 2006, was the last drug launched and did not rule out the use
of the first oral anti-hyperglycemic drug represented by sulfonylureas. in fact, sulfonylureas, discovered in the fifties, are still the
most prescribed class of anti-diabetic drugs. it took 40 years to
market tzds since sulfonylurea was available for treatment. will it
take 40 more years until we see in the market a new drug that safely
treats type ii diabetes?
