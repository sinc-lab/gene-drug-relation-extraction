abstract the purpose of this study was to ascertain if effects of halothane and  xxxd3197xxx 
(0.18–1.45 mac) on the magnitude of the rise in intracellular calcium ([ca2+]i with ~90s
hypoxia (measured using indo-1 dye) in rat pup carotid body type i glomus cells. paralleled
their known effects on the human hypoxic ventilatory response, where halothane is more
depressive. we also assessed these agents’ effect on [ca2+]i response to 100 mm k+. halothane depressed the [ca2+]i transient in hypoxia more than  xxxd3197xxx  (p = 0.036). both
agents also depressed the [ca2+]i response to k+ – halothane more than  xxxd3197xxx 
(p = 0.004). these actions reflect their known influence on human hypoxic ventilatory response, consistent with the notion that the cellular process underlies the whole-body effect.
the responses to k+, which depolarises the cell membrane, indicates that in addition to a
putative effect on k+ channels, voltage-activated ca2+ channels may also be involved in the
anaesthetic effect.

1 introduction
even at ~0.1 minimum alveolar concentration (mac), volatile anaesthetics depress
the human ventilatory response to hypoxia by ~50% (pandit 2002). however, different agents have different potencies: halothane is the most depressive;  xxxd3197xxx 
one of the least (pandit 2002). buckler et al. described a background task-like k+
channel in the carotid body glomus (type i) cell that is sensitive to hypoxia and halothane (buckler et al. 2000). these channels are important in determining resting
membrane potential, and the reduction of their open probability by hypoxia results in
depolarisation of the cell and voltage gated ca2+-influx. if this channel responds
similarly with other volatile anaesthetics, it would make a compelling case that it
underlies the mechanisms involved in the effect of all volatile anaesthetics on the
human chemoreflex response. it is therefore important to establish if anaesthetic
depresses glomus cell hypoxic response and further, if the variation in anaesthetic
effect known in humans is reflected in a similar variation in effect at the glomus cell
(e.g. if halothane is the most depressive at cell level, and  xxxd3197xxx  less so).

2 methods
experiments were performed on glomus cells enzymatically isolated from neonatal
sprague dawley rat pups (10–13 days old), as described elsewhere (buckler et al.
2000) and plated out onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. cells were
loaded with indo-1 by incubation with 2.5 mum indo 1-am and [ca2+]i measured by
fluorescence. tyrode solution was equilibrated with 5% co2 in air (‘euoxia’), or
with 5% co2 in n2 (‘hypoxia’), and both with a range of anaesthetic doses. each
experimental period consisted of alternating 90 s exposures to these solutions.
in experiments on the response to 100 mm k+, all experiments were conducted
with background euoxic gas, with or without anaesthetic, and exposures were of ~30
s duration. the anaesthetics used for this part of the experiment were either 2% halothane (1.81 mac) or 5%  xxxd3197xxx  (2 mac).
the magnitude of the rise in [ca2+]i was the ‘ca2+ -transient’ and the ratio of
these magnitudes with and without anesthetic (i.e., ca2+ -transient with anaesthetic /
ca2+ -transient without anaesthetic) represented the anaesthetic effect. thus the ratio
would be 1.0 if anaesthetic had no effect; if anaesthetic abolished the response to
hypoxia or k+completely, the ratio would be zero. we averaged the ratios obtained at
each concentration of anaesthetic to obtain the mean for that concentration, separately for each of the two agents. the statistical significance of differences between
the means of the ratios was assessed using factorial analysis of variance with post
hoc student t-tests with bonferroni’s correction.

3 results
figures 1 and 2 show the contrasting effects of halothane and  xxxd3197xxx  on [ca2+]i
with hypoxia: the former is more depressive. figure 3 confirms this effect over the
whole dose range examined. anova confirmed that the effect of halothane was
significant over all doses (p < 0.001), and that it differed from  xxxd3197xxx  (p =
0.036), whose effect was significant at only its highest dose (p = 0.001). similarly,
agents showed contrasting effects on the response to high k+, with both agents depressing the response (p < 0.001), but halothane again exhibiting a somewhat more
depressive effect (60% vs 70%; p = 0.004).

4 discussion
our result is probably the first demonstration that volatile anaesthetics can attenuate
glomus cell activity. these effects on the hypoxic response vary with concentration
for both agents and these effects on hypoxic response and high k+ response differ for
the two agents, with halothane attenuating the responses more than  xxxd3197xxx .
our observations in single cells are consistent with previous reports on the effects
of these agents on respiratory chemoreflexes in animals (pandit 2007) and in humans
(pandit 2002). this makes it very tempting to conclude that the anaesthetic effects on

type i cell activity that we report underlie their effects on whole-body hypoxic ventilatory response (i.e., the primary site of action of anaesthetic when depressing the
hypoxic response in humans is at the carotid body).
if this is the case, then it is possible that halothane, as previously reported, may
exert its effect via the hypoxia- acid- anesthetic-sensitive task-like k+ channel
(buckler et al. 2000), and this may be true for  xxxd3197xxx  (with the implication
being that the affinity and/or the efficacy of these two agents differ for this channel).
our results justify the need to assess this possibility more directly using voltage
clamp techniques. a recent report indicated that 1 mac of agent potentiated the
 xxxg1258xxx  mediated current in fisher rat thyroid epithelial monolayer preparations in
the order halothane >  xxxd1993xxx  >  xxxd1844xxx  > nitrous oxide (cotten and miller
2006), the same order of potency as in humans (pandit 2002).
we discovered that both halothane and  xxxd3197xxx  also reduce the [ca2+]i response to high k+-induced membrane depolarization which inactivates most known
k+ channels but not the activity of the voltage-gated ca2+ channels (overholt and
prabhakar 1997). halothane, and to a lesser extent  xxxd3197xxx , may also interfere
with these: there is evidence that voltage-gated ca2+ channels are inhibited by anaesthetic agents in neural (overholt and prabhakar 1997) and cardiac (dolphin 2006)
tissue, although little is currently known about their interaction with anaesthetics in
the carotid body.
future studies should extend our observations to acid or co2 stimuli and the
effect of other anaesthetics (e.g., isoflurane or intravenous agents) on glomus cell
responses. it would further be important to establish if the effects we describe for
volatile anaesthetics are mediated by differential sensitivity of the hypoxia- and
anaesthetic sensitive task-like k+ channel to various agents, or if other mechanisms (such as voltage-gated ca2+ channels) are more important.
