abstract rationale:  xxxd3562xxx  is an anti-migraine
agent with action at 5-ht1b/d receptors. it penetrates into
the central nervous system and, like other 5-ht1b/d agonists, its pharmacotherapeutic profile may include significant anti-aggressive effects. objectives: to examine
whether  xxxd3562xxx  has potential anti-aggressive effects
by studying two kinds of aggressive behavior in mice –
species-typical and aggression under the influence of alcohol. a second objective was to study whether pre- or
post-synaptic receptors mediate these anti-aggressive effects. methods: initially, the anti-aggressive effects of
 xxxd3562xxx  were studied in male cfw mice during
5-min resident–intruder confrontations. to confirm the
 xxxg1109xxx  as a critical site of action for the antiaggressive effects, the  xxxd3562xxx  dose–effect determinations were repeated after pretreatment with gr
127935 (10 mg/kg, i.p.). in further experiments, mice
were treated concurrently with alcohol (1.0 g/kg, p.o.)
and  xxxd3562xxx  (1–30 mg/kg, i.p.) in order to compare
the effects of this agonist on species-typical and alcoholheightened aggression. finally, mice were infused with
the neurotoxin 5,7-dht (10 µg) into the raphé area to
eliminate somatodendritic and presynaptic autoreceptors.
the anti-aggressive effects of  xxxd3562xxx  (17 mg/kg,
i.p.) or cp-94,253 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were assessed 10 days
after the lesion, and levels of 5-ht and 5-hiaa were
measured in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
results:  xxxd3562xxx  exerted behaviorally specific antiaggressive effects. the reduction in aggression was antagonized by gr 127935, indicated by a rightward shift
in the dose–effect curves of  xxxd3562xxx , showing the

specificity for the 5-ht1b receptors.  xxxd3562xxx  also
decreased alcohol-heightened aggression with equal efficacy. the anti-aggressive effects of cp-94,253 and  xxxd3562xxx  remained unaltered by 5,7-dht lesions that
depleted cortical and hippocampal 5-ht by 60–80%.
conclusions:  xxxd3562xxx  proved to be an effective and
behaviorally specific anti-aggressive agent in situations
that engender moderate and alcohol-heightened levels of
aggression. these effects are potentially due to activation of post-synaptic 5-ht1b/d receptors.

introduction
clinical and pre-clinical evidence has consistently pointed to brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) as a
critical component in the neurobiological mechanisms
for aggressive behavior. across multiple species, levels
of tryptophan in blood and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid
(5-hiaa) in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) are often inversely correlated with the propensity to be violent and to engage in impulsive behavior (valzelli and garattini 1968;
virkkunen 1979; linnoila et al. 1983, 1989; virkkunen
et al. 1994; cleare and bond 1995; higley et al. 1996;
higley and bennett 1999). selective 5-ht agonists reduce aggression in animals, suggesting that these agents
may have therapeutic potential for managing violent offenders (olivier et al. 1989; mos et al. 1993; sanchez et
al. 1993; miczek et al. 1998a; fish et al. 1999; for review see schreiber and devry 1993; miczek et al.
1995).
among the 5-ht receptor subtypes that have been
identified through molecular cloning techniques, the
5-ht1b receptors appear to be particularly relevant to aggressive behavior, as agonists at this site reduce aggression without impairing locomotor behavior in mice and
rats (olivier et al. 1989; sijbesma et al. 1991; sanchez et

132

al. 1996; fish et al. 1999; sekinda et al. 1999). the selective  xxxg1109xxx  agonist, cp-94,253, has also
been shown to be capable of reducing very high levels of
aggressive behavior, levels in excess of species-typical
norms (fish et al. 1999). furthermore, anpirtoline, another piperidine derivative with 5-ht1b agonist effects,
decreases intense aggression without compromising motor functions (miczek and de almeida 2001).
the triptans are a family of  xxxg1109xxx  agonists
that have been used clinically for the treatment of migraine (goadsby 1998). while many of these agonists
exert primary actions on vascular receptors,  xxxd3562xxx 
penetrates into the central nervous system more easily
than other triptans due to its lipophilic properties
(proietti-cecchini et al. 1997; hargreaves and shepheard
1999). centrally mediated effects of  xxxd3562xxx  on
growth hormone levels have been seen in patients with
obsessive compulsive disorder (whale et al. 1999), but
the behavioral effects of  xxxd3562xxx  in laboratory animals have not been systematically studied. given the
current clinical use of  xxxd3562xxx , it is important to determine other potential applications. one objective of the
present study was to examine the effects of  xxxd3562xxx 
on aggressive behavior in male mice. to more thoroughly characterize the efficacy of  xxxd3562xxx , two kinds
of aggressive behavior were studied – species-typical aggression and heightened aggression under the influence
of alcohol.
the effects of alcohol on aggression are largely dependent on the amount of alcohol and the individual’s
behavioral history and vulnerability. large amounts of
alcohol are sedative and decrease aggression (krsiak and
borgesova 1973; lagerspetz and ekqvist 1978; smoothy
et al. 1982). however, low to moderate amounts of alcohol can engender very large increases in aggressive behavior, but only in certain vulnerable individuals (van
erp and miczek 1997; miczek et al. 1998b). in outbred
rats and mice, a subgroup of about 25% consistently becomes very aggressive while under the influence of alcohol; these animals are referred to as aha (alcoholheightened aggressors) (miczek et al. 1992, 1998b; van
erp and miczek 1997). most mice and rats, however, do
not consistently become more aggressive after alcohol;
these individuals are referred to as ana (alcohol-nonheightened aggressors). alcohol-heightened aggression
has been shown to be more sensitive to the anti-aggressive effects of the 5-ht1b agonist cp-94,253 than alcohol-non-heightened aggression (fish et al. 1999). the
demonstration that  xxxd3562xxx  reduces aggression after
alcohol would strengthen the clinical potential of this
compound because most acts of aggression and violence
in humans are related to alcohol use (miczek et al. 1994;
roizen 1996). if  xxxd3562xxx  is effective in those mice
that are highly aggressive after alcohol, it would support
the hypothesis that 5-ht1b receptors are of significance,
presumably indirectly, in the aggression-heightening effects of alcohol (fish et al. 1999).
the mouse and rat 5-ht1b receptors are functionally
homologous to the human 5- ht1b receptor, differing by

a single amino acid (adham et al. 1992; oksenberg et al.
1992; price et al. 1996; schlicker et al. 1997). the receptors are coupled to gi/o proteins and are located both preand post-synaptically in the basal ganglia, striatum, and
frontal cortex, as well as in the raphé nuclei (boschert et
al. 1994; davidson and stamford 1995). activation of
pre-synaptic 5-ht1b receptors decreases extracellular
concentrations of 5-ht in the cortex, ventral hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus (roberts et al. 1997;
knobelman et al. 2000).
evidence from studies with the 5-ht1b/d receptor antagonist gr 127935 points to the  xxxg1109xxx  as the
relevant site of action for reversing anti-aggressive, antidepressant, locomotor stimulating and anxiolytic-like effects, as well as the effects on dopamine and serotonin
neurotransmission by agonists acting at the  xxxg1109xxx  in rodents (miczek and barry 1977; bell et al.
1995; o’neill et al. 1996, 1997; parsons et al. 1998; fish
et al. 1999, 2000; fletcher and korth 1999; sarhan et al.
1999; knobelman et al. 2000). however, the precise pool
of 5-ht1b receptors that is critical for the specific behavioral and physiological effects of these agonist drugs remains unknown. some evidence with mixed 5-ht1b agonists points to post-synaptic receptors as mediating the
anorectic, anti-aggressive, and locomotor-stimulating
effects (kennett et al. 1987; oberlander et al. 1987;
fernandez-guasti and escalante 1991; sijbesma et al.
1991). to address whether the effects of  xxxd3562xxx  and
cp-94,253 are preferentially mediated by pre- or postsynaptic receptors, the median effective doses of these
drugs were studied in mice after degeneration of 5-htcontaining neurons via injection of 5,7-dht into the
raphé nuclei. if the efficacy of  xxxd3562xxx  or cp-94,253
were diminished after the neurochemical lesion, it would
indicate that pre-synaptic receptors are involved in the
anti-aggressive effects of these drugs.

methods
subjects
adult male cfw mice (charles river laboratories, wilmington,
mass.), weighing approximately 25 g on arrival, were housed in
clear polycarbonate cages (28×17×14 cm) with wood-chip bedding and wire lids through which purina rodent chow and water
were freely available. mice (n=50) were housed as “residents”
with females of the same strain. each cage contained a male and
female pair. additional male cfw mice (n=100) were housed in
groups of ten and served as “intruder” mice. the mice acclimated
to the laboratory for 3–5 weeks before behavioral testing. all mice
were housed in a controlled vivarium maintained at 22±1°c with
30–40% humidity on a 12-h:12-h photocycle. all procedures followed the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (national research council 1996) and were approved by the animal
care and use committee at tufts university.
apparatus and measurements
the behavior of the mice was recorded via a low-lux video camera
and a standard video cassette recorder. salient aggressive and nonaggressive behaviors were scored by a trained observer using the

133
custom-designed data acquisition system similar to that in previously described methods (miczek 1982). the behavioral acts comprised the following aggressive elements: anogenital contact with
the intruder, pursuit, sideways threat, bite, and tail rattle, as well
as the following non-aggressive elements: grooming, walking, and
rearing. intra-observer reliability for encoding these behaviors was
calculated using the spearman correlation coefficient and ranged
from 0.85 for the duration of walking to 0.98 for the frequency of
attack bites.
drugs
 xxxd3562xxx  [(s)-4-[[3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1h-indol-5-yl]methyl]-2-oxazolidinone); astrazeneca pharmaceuticals limited,
london, england] and gr 127935 [n-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1piperazinyl)phenyl]-2-methyl-4'-(methyl-1,2,4-oxadiozol-3-yl)[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide; glaxo research and development
ltd., london, england] were suspended with the aid of sonication
in 20% and 10% bcd (hydroxypropyl-betacyclodextrin), respectively. cp-94,253 [(3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-5-propoxypirolo[3,2-b]pyridine); charles pfizer, groton, ct] was dissolved with the aid of sonication in a vehicle of 5% tween 80, 5%
dmso ( xxxd1896xxx ), and 90% distilled water.  xxxd3562xxx , cp-94,253, and gr 127935 were administered i.p. in a volume of 1 ml/100 g body weight. 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate [3-(2-aminoethyl)-1h-indole-5,7-diol creatinine sulfate; research biochemicals international, natick, mass.] was dissolved in 0.9% physiological saline with 0.1%  xxxd228xxx  and
injected locally into the raphé area (for injection parameters see
below). the alcohol solution was prepared by diluting 100% alcohol (aaper alcohol co., shelbyvile, ky.) to 10.0% (w/v) with
distilled water and was administered orally in a volume of
1 ml/100 g body weight. for anesthesia, avertin (2–2-2 tribromoethanol; sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo.) was dissolved in tertamyl alcohol and diluted with saline to 40 mg/ml and administered i.p. in a volume of 1 ml/100 g body weight.
experimental procedures
resident–intruder confrontations
the first phase ensured that all mice achieved stable levels of aggression toward an intruder (miczek and o’donnell 1978). after
the females and pups were removed from the home cage, an intruder mouse was introduced. tests lasted for 5 min after the first
attack bite or for 5 min if the mouse did not bite. by the tenth confrontation, the frequency of attack bites stabilized around a baseline level of aggression of about 25 attack bites. for the next 2–4
tests, the residents were habituated to either an i.p. or a p.o. injection, depending on the specific experiment. during all aggression
experiments, the mice were tested twice a week, with a minimum
of 72 h between each test session. all encounters were conducted
between 0900 hours and 1300 hours, and the behaviors were analyzed at a later date. new intruders were introduced after approximately ten confrontations. vehicle trials were repeated if the frequency of attack bites was lower than ten or less than 20% of
baseline.
 xxxd3562xxx  dose–effect and antagonism by gr 127935
eighteen mice were used to determine the effects of  xxxd3562xxx 
(3–30 mg/kg) on aggressive behavior. different doses of  xxxd3562xxx  were administered in a counterbalanced sequence 15 min
before the confrontation with the intruder. each drug test alternated with a vehicle test. fifteen mice were used to determine the effect of pre-treatment with gr 127935 (10.0 mg/kg) on the
dose–effect curve for  xxxd3562xxx  (10–56.0 mg/kg). gr 127935
was administered 30 min prior to  xxxd3562xxx , and all tests occurred 15 min after the administration of  xxxd3562xxx .

effects of  xxxd3562xxx  and alcohol on aggression
a separate group of mice (n=32) was used to determine whether
 xxxd3562xxx  could also reduce the high levels of aggression that
can occur after the administration of a moderate dose of alcohol
(i.e., 1.0 g/kg). this dose of alcohol was selected because previous
experiments showed that it was the most effective in increasing
aggression toward an intruder in the largest number of mice
(miczek et al. 1993, 1998b). to distinguish mice that consistently
showed large increases in aggressive behavior from those that did
not, the effects of 1.0 g/kg alcohol were determined four times and
compared with the interspersed four vehicle control tests. if the
average number of attack bites after alcohol exceeded the vehicle
baseline by at least 2 sd, based on a statistical outlier criterion
(barnett and lewis 1984), then the mouse was considered an
aha. all other mice were considered ana. following categorization of aha and ana mice,  xxxd3562xxx  (3–17 mg/kg) was administered to these mice immediately following an injection with
alcohol (1.0 g/kg). the doses of 1.0 mg/kg and 30.0 mg/kg  xxxd3562xxx  were administered to subgroups of mice (n=14 and n=18,
respectively). the remaining doses of  xxxd3562xxx  were administered in a counterbalanced sequence and each drug test was altered
with a vehicle test. aggression tests occurred 15 min after administration of both drugs.
lesion with 5,7 dht
surgery. mice from the previous studies were randomly assigned
to the 5,7-dht lesion subgroup (n=13) and to the vehicle-treated
subgroup (n=12). desimipramine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 20 min before the neurotoxin injection to protect catecholaminergic neurons. after anesthesia, the mice were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus with a mouse frame adapter (david kopf;
tujunga, calif.). freshly dissolved 5,7-dht (10 µg in 2 µl sterile
saline, containing 0.1%  xxxd228xxx ) was infused into the dorsal
raphé at the following coordinates: 4.48 mm posterior to bregma;
2.75 mm below the dura mater (franklin and paxinos 1997). the
solution was delivered at a rate of 0.5 µl/min for 4 min, through a
30-g stainless-steel cannula connected to a microinfusion pump.
sham-operated, vehicle-injected mice were used for comparison in
all experimental conditions. four weeks later, parts of the frontal
cortex and hippocampus were removed for later analysis of 5-ht
and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-hiaa) as described below.
aggression tests. ten days after surgery, the anti-aggressive effects
of  xxxd3562xxx  (17 mg/kg) and cp-94,253 (10 mg/kg) were tested.
 xxxd3562xxx , cp-94,253, and their respective vehicles were administered in a counterbalanced sequence 15 min before an aggressive confrontation. aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors
were analyzed as described above.
measurement of 5-ht and 5-hiaa. the mice were decapitated
and their brains were removed from the skull on an ice-cooled
block. frontal cortex and hippocampus were dissected, and the
samples were frozen in dry ice and stored at –70°c. for the assay,
the tissue samples were weighed, 200 ml of homogenization
solution [0.1 m phosphate buffer and 0.0001% ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid (edta)] was added, and then they were homogenized by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 12 min.
supernatants were collected and the concentrations of 5-ht and
5-hiaa were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with electrochemical detection. the hplc mobile phase (0.1 m phosphate buffer, 5% acetonitrile, 0.0001%
edta, ph 3.4) was pumped through a reverse-phase 4.6×
50.00-mm column (rainin, woburn, mass.) at a flow rate of
0.8 ml/min. the amount of 5-ht and 5-hiaa was quantified from
their respective peak heights on the chromatogram obtained from
an internal standard of  xxxd70xxx .

data analysis
all data for the dose–effect and antagonism experiments were analyzed using a one-way repeated-measure analysis of variance
(anova) and, when appropriate, dunnett’s post-hoc tests were
used with vehicle values as the common control. the effect of gr
127935 alone compared with vehicle was analyzed using a paired
t-test. the ed50 value was defined as the dose of  xxxd3562xxx  that
produced a 50% reduction in behavior relative to the baseline and
was calculated using linear regression. non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals were considered as statistically different. the data for the alcohol and  xxxd3562xxx  interaction study were also analyzed using a one-way repeated-measures anova. however,
when appropriate, dunnett’s post-hoc tests were run with average
alcohol values as the common control. the magnitude of the effect
of alcohol on aggressive behavior within and between aha and
ana mice was analyzed using t-tests. the effects of 1 mg/kg and
30 mg/kg  xxxd3562xxx  with 1.0 g/kg ethanol were analyzed using
a paired t-test, since these treatments were added in a subgroup of
animals only. the behavioral data from the 5,7-dht experiment
were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures anova and,
when appropriate, student newman-keuls as a post-hoc test. the
alpha level was set at 0.05. t-tests were used to compare sham and
lesion levels of 5-ht and 5-hiaa in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. a bonferroni adjustment corrected for multiple comparisons. the level for these comparisons was set at 0.0125.

results
all “residents” engaged in stable levels of species-typical aggression throughout all phases of this study. on average, these mice attacked the intruders with short latencies (i.e., 1–10 s), high frequencies (approximately 25),
and low inter-trial variability (<20%).
 xxxd3562xxx  dose–effect and antagonism by gr 127935
aggression
 xxxd3562xxx  significantly decreased the frequency of attack bites (f4,17=38.95, p<0.001) and sideways threats
(f4,17=14.17, p<0.001) at the 3.0–30.0 mg/kg doses, and
tail rattles (f4,17=5.96, p<0.001) at the doses of 5.6–
17 mg/kg (fig. 1 and table 1). when administered alone,
gr 127935 significantly decreased the frequency of pursuit (t14=2.16, p<0.048) but did not affect other aggressive behaviors. when administered prior to  xxxd3562xxx ,
gr 127935 produced a significant rightward shift in the
bite frequency dose–effect curve of  xxxd3562xxx  (fig. 1).
the ed50 values and 95% confidence intervals (ci95) for
the effects of  xxxd3562xxx  on bite and threat frequency
were 5.64 mg/kg (2.52, 9.05) and 11.2 mg/kg (4.56,
25.56). in the presence of gr 127935, the ed50 and ci95
values were 20.47 mg/kg (14.6, 26.97) and 22.02 mg/kg
(15.26, 28.50) for gr 127935, respectively. in the presence of gr 127935 (10 mg/kg), 10.0–56.0 mg/kg  xxxd3562xxx  was necessary to decrease the frequency of attack
bite (f3,14=68.21, p<0.0001) and sideways threats
(f3,14=56.91, p<0.0001; fig. 1; table 1). the frequency
of tail rattles (f3,14=18.80, p<0.001) was significantly
decreased at the doses of 30 mg/kg and 56 mg/kg, and

the frequency of pursuit (f3,14=3.66, p<0.02) was decreased at the dose of 56 mg/kg (table 1).
locomotor behavior
the effects of  xxxd3562xxx  were specific to aggression as
the durations of walking, rearing, and grooming were not
significantly altered by these doses of  xxxd3562xxx  (table 1). however, when administered after pre-treatment
with gr 127935, the highest dose of  xxxd3562xxx 
(56.0 mg/kg) decreased the duration of walking (f3,14=
3.76, p=0.018; table 1). gr 127935 alone did not affect
any of the locomotor behaviors (table 1).
behavioral effects of alcohol
twelve of thirty-two mice were determined to be ahas,
because the frequency of attack bites after alcohol exceeded the individual's vehicle baseline by 2 sd (fig. 2).

the mice (n=20) that did not demonstrate this degree of
enhanced aggression were termed ana. while under the
influence of alcohol, both the aha and ana mice demonstrated a significantly heightened level of attack bites
(aha t11=9.39, p<0.001; ana t19=4.83, p<0.0001)
and sideways threats (aha t11=7.72, p<0.001; ana
t19=4.20, p<0.001; fig. 3 and table 2), although the increase was significantly larger in aha than ana mice
(t30=4.49, p<0.001; fig. 3). in the aha mice, alcohol
increased the frequency of pursuit (t11=2.42, p<0.034;
table 2) and the duration of walking (t11=2.96, p<0.013;
table 2).

effects of  xxxd3562xxx  and alcohol on aggression
fig. 2 differences in the response to orally administered alcohol
(1.0 g/kg) are indicated by the change in attack frequency of each
individual mouse when compared with its vehicle control level.
the vertical bars represent the change in attack frequency expressed as standard deviations from the average vehicle control
level for each individual. if the number of attacks exceeded the individual’s vehicle control by two standard deviations or more,
then the mouse was considered to exhibit alcohol-heightened aggression (aha); mice whose aggressive behavior did not meet this
criterion were considered to be non-heightened (ana)

the effects of  xxxd3562xxx  on measures of aggression after alcohol were similar between aha and ana mice.
administration of  xxxd3562xxx  dose dependently decreased alcohol-heightened aggression as indicated by
the frequency of attack bites (aha f4,11=21.60,
p<0.001; ana f4,19=26.80, p<0.001; fig. 3) and sideways threats (aha f4,11=9.47, p<0.001; ana f4,19=
13.92, p<0.001) at the doses of 3–17 mg/kg. the fre-

relation between the degree of 5-ht depletion and the
frequency of attack bites. administration of cp-94,253
(10 mg/kg) significantly decreased the duration of rearing when compared with the sham group (table 4). administration of  xxxd3562xxx  (17 mg/kg) significantly increased the duration of grooming and decreased walking
(table 4).

discussion
aggression is effectively reduced by the administration
of agonists with activity at 5-ht1b receptors (olivier et
al. 1989; sijbesma et al. 1991; sanchez et al. 1993; fish
et al. 1999). the present studies extend these antiaggressive effects to  xxxd3562xxx , a 5-ht1b/1d receptor
agonist used clinically to treat migraine.  xxxd3562xxx  did
not induce motor impairment or stimulation, indicating a
high degree of behavioral specificity. moreover,  xxxd3562xxx ’s anti-aggressive effects are likely mediated by
5-ht1b/1d receptors, because the 5-ht1b/1d receptor antagonist gr 127935 blocked the effects of  xxxd3562xxx .
destruction of the 5-ht-containing neurons in the raphé
area did not alter the anti-aggressive effects of  xxxd3562xxx , suggesting the involvement of post-synaptic receptors.
the remarkable degree of behavioral specificity observed after treatment with  xxxd3562xxx  appears to characterize other  xxxg1109xxx  agonists such as the arylpiperidines cp-94,253 and anpirtoline (fish et al. 1999;
miczek and de almeida 2001). these agents decrease
the salient elements of murine aggressive behavior (i.e.,
sideways threats, attack bites, and tail rattles) without
significant effects on non-aggressive motor behaviors including walking, rearing, and grooming. this lack of
motor impairment distinguishes 5-ht1b agonists from
most 5-ht1a agonists, such as 8-oh-dpat and flesinoxan, and partial agonists such as buspirone, ipsapirone, and gepirone. these latter agents reduce aggression
by inhibiting motor routines that are necessary to perform social behaviors (mcmillen et al. 1988; olivier et
al. 1989, 1994; mos et al. 1993; sanchez et al. 1993; de
almeida and lucion 1994, 1997; miczek et al. 1998a).
however, the recently developed  xxxg1108xxx  agonists alnespirone and s-15535 may have more specific
anti-aggressive effects in rats (de boer et al. 1999,
2000). studies with 5-ht1a and 5-ht1b knockout mice
also display a number of contrasting behavioral phenotypes (saudou et al. 1994; brunner et al. 1999; zhuang
et al. 1999).
at recombinant human 5-ht1 receptors,  xxxd3562xxx 
is one of the more selective agents, having a greater affinity for 5-ht1b receptors than for 5-ht1a receptors
(pki=9.08 vs 6.93; pauwels et al. 1997).  xxxd3562xxx 
also displays a high affinity for  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
(pki=9.66), but there is a relatively small number of
 xxxg1110xxx  binding sites in rodents (bruinvels et al. 1993;
hoyer et al. 1994). so far, there is no evidence that implicates the  xxxg1110xxx  receptors in the neurobiological con-

 xxxd3105xxx  of aggression. this type of receptor has begun to be
considered as a pharmacotherapeutic target in psychiatric
and other disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and
depression (fuller 1991; chopin et al. 1994). evidence
for the  xxxg1109xxx  as the critical site of action for
 xxxd3562xxx  derives from the fact that administration of
gr 127935, an antagonist with high affinity (about
10 nm) for 5-ht1b/d receptors (skingle et al. 1996), produced a rightward shift in the dose–effect curve for  xxxd3562xxx . gr 127935 has also been shown to antagonize the effects of 5-ht1b agonists on a variety of behavioral and physiological endpoints (o’neill et al. 1996;
pauwels et al. 1997; maurel et al. 1998; parsons et al.
1998; fish et al. 1999, 2000; fletcher and korth 1999;
harrison et al. 1999; knobelman et al. 2000). in the
present experiment and other pilot experiments, when
administered alone and across a range of doses, gr
127935 had no effect on aggressive or locomotor behaviors in adult mice or ultrasonic vocalizations in mouse
pups, suggesting that gr 127935 is not acting as a partial agonist (miczek et al. unpublished data, fish et al.
1999, 2000).
evidence suggests that 5-ht1b receptors are involved
in many of the effects of alcohol. administration of
 xxxg1109xxx  agonists decreases alcohol intake
(maurel et al. 1999; tomkins and o’neill 2000) and can
substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol (grant et al. 1997; maurel et al. 1998). mice lacking
the  xxxg1109xxx  gene consume more alcohol than
wild-type mice and are more sensitive to some of the
ataxic effects of alcohol (crabbe et al. 1996; boehm et
al. 2000; but see crabbe et al. 1999b; bouwknecht et al.
2000). using quantitative trait loci analysis in bxd recombinant inbred mice, the  xxxg1109xxx  gene has
been identified as a potential candidate gene for alcohol
preference (crabbe et al. 1999a). polymorphisms in the
 xxxg1109xxx  gene have also been linked to antisocial
personality and alcoholism in humans (lappalainen et
al. 1998; but see huang et al. 1999). additionally, the
 xxxg1109xxx  agonist cp-94,253 decreases the aggression-heightening effects of alcohol at doses lower than
those necessary to reduce species-typical aggression
(fish et al. 1999). unlike cp-94,253,  xxxd3562xxx  did
not differentially affect alcohol-heightened aggression.
although both compounds act primarily at 5-ht1b receptors, it is possible that activity at other receptor subtypes may account for this differential pattern of effects.
the selective anti-aggressive effects of  xxxg1109xxx  agonists have consistently been shown, but evidence
on whether this occurs via pre- or postsynaptic receptor
mechanisms is conflicting. support for presynaptic
sites of action primarily derives from studies demonstrating that  xxxg1109xxx  agonists reduce 5-ht release
(roberts et al. 1997; knobelman et al. 2000). however,
post-synaptic sites of action have been implicated by the
observations that 5,7-dht lesions of the raphé nuclei or
para-chlorophenylalanine (pcpa) synthesis inhibition
did not alter the anti-aggressive effects of eltoprazine,
the anorectic effects of ru 24969, or the inhibitory ef-

139

fects of n-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (tfmpp)
on sexual behavior (kennett et al. 1987; fernandezguasti and escalante 1991; sijbesma et al. 1991).
neurotoxic destruction of the 5-ht neurons by
5,7-dht often reduces aggression in mice and rats
(pöschlova et al. 1976; file and deakin 1980; matte 1982;
sijbesma et al. 1991; johansson et al. 1999). in the present
study, the baseline levels of aggression were not affected
by the 5,7-dht lesion, possibly due to the animals’ extensive experience with aggressive behavior prior to the lesion. after lesions of the presynaptic and somatodentric
receptors with 5,7-dht,  xxxd3562xxx  and cp-94,253 were
still capable of decreasing aggressive behavior. this observation suggests that the anti-aggressive effects of  xxxd3562xxx  and cp-94,253 do not require the integrity of
the 5-ht neurons. the present neurotoxic lesions in mice
spared approximately 20–40% of the ascending 5-ht neurons, and the contribution of pre-synaptic sites to the antiaggressive effects cannot be eliminated completely. furthermore, the present 2-µl infusions of 5,7-dht caused an
anatomically widespread degeneration of 5-ht neurons
that receive innervation from the dorsal or median raphé
nuclei. it is also possible that the 5,7-dht depletion alters
the sensitivity of post-synaptic 5-ht1b receptors, and this
may compensate for the reduced pre-synaptic actions of
 xxxd3562xxx  and cp-94,253. studies with 5,7-dht have
shown alterations in the sensitivity of the 5-ht1a and
5-ht1b receptors after the neurotoxic lesion (oberlander
et al. 1987; sijbesma et al. 1991; dugar and lakoski
1997; van de kar et al. 1998). receptor upregulation
is one hypothesis for increased sensitivity following
5,7-dht lesions (weissmann et al. 1986; oberlander et al.
1987; sijbesma et al. 1991; frankfurt et al. 1993, 1994;
manrique et al. 1994), although other changes, such as in
signal transduction pathways, are also probable mechanisms. in addition to the currently used doses, studies with
further doses of cp-94,253 provided no evidence for a
possible leftward shift in dose–effect curves (nikulina,
unpublished observations), as otherwise suggested by
studies with the mixed 5-ht1a/1b agonist eltoprazine
(sijbesma et al. 1991).
given the evolutionary diversity of aggressive behavior and 5-ht receptor subtypes, it will be important to
investigate the effects of  xxxg1109xxx  agonists in different types of aggression and in primates. another important experiment is to evaluate the role of pre- and
post-synaptic 5-ht1b receptors via microinjection of selective agonists and antagonists into putative sites of action such as the dorsal raphé, pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area. studies with the
mixed 5-ht1a/1b agonist eltoprazine suggest that the
postsynaptic  xxxg1109xxx  modulates offensive aggression in male rats (mos et al. 1992, 1993). if the antiaggressive effects of  xxxd3562xxx  and cp-94,253 are indeed due to action at post-synaptic receptors, then identifying the interactions with other neurotransmitter systems, possibly  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) and dopamine, could determine the mechanisms through which
 xxxg1109xxx  agonists specifically decrease aggres-

sive behaviors. since the gabaa receptor represents a
site through which alcohol heightens aggression (weerts
et al. 1993; fish et al. 2001), the serotonergic modulation
of gaba activity may be particularly critical.
