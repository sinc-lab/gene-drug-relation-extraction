pyridine nucleotide flux and glutathione oxidation
in the cultured rat conceptus

abstract — it is proposed that protection of the developing embryo from chemical and environmental insults that
produces oxidative stress requires a proper glutathione (gsh) and pyridine nucleotide status in both the embryo
and extra-embryonic membranes. modulation of pyridine nucleotide flux {nad(h) and nad(p)h} in the visceral
yolk sac (vys) by the thiol oxidants diamide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tbh) was studied in real time using
microfiberoptic sensors in gd 10 rat conceptuses. consecutive 5-min exposures to 125- and 250-mm diamide
resulted in a fluorescence decrease of 14 and 32 arbitrary fluorescence units (afu). an additional consecutive
exposure to 500-mm diamide caused an attenuated decrease followed by a rebound increase of 22 afu.
consecutive 5-min exposures to tbh at 250 and 500 mm produced fluorescence decreases similar to that of 500
mm diamide, but the decreases were attenuated at 1000 mm. however, there was variability in the rebound
increase. a 5-min exposure to tbh (500 mm) alone caused a fluorescence decrease of 14 afu followed by a
rebound increase of 8 afu. the rate of fluorescence decrease was attenuated by 50% with pretreatment with the
 xxxg981xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx -rd) inhibitor,  xxxd444xxx  (1,3, bis(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea), indicating that the
decrease in surface fluorescence was probably attributable to a decrease in nadph. decreases in fluorescence,
observed from the surface of the vys, correlated with decreases in gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratios in the embryos and the
vys. after exposure to tbh, gsh levels in conceptuses decreased at the end of 5 and 15 min, with a
corresponding increase in  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) at the end of 3, 5, and 15 min. our results demonstrate
that the increased production of  xxxd2811xxx  on exposure to thiol oxidants correlates with a decrease in the reduced
pyridine nucleotide, implying the presence of an active  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway in the conceptus during organogenesis, and implicating an important role of the pyridine nucleotides in the restoration of gsh homeostasis in the
developing rat conceptus during organogenesis. © 1999 elsevier science inc.

peroxides and in the termination of lipid peroxidation. in
the process, gsh is oxidized to  xxxd2811xxx 
( xxxd2811xxx ).  xxxd2811xxx  is then reduced to gsh by  xxxd2811xxx -rd,
which uses nadph as a reducing cofactor (2).
alterations in gsh status are implicated in the
embryotoxicity and dysmorphogenesis elicited by several drugs and chemicals in the organogenesis-stage rat
conceptus (3– 8). accumulation of chemicals, their bioactivation to reactive intermediates, and subsequent detoxification, especially under conditions of oxidative
stress, result in depletion of gsh pools via oxidation to
 xxxd2811xxx  or formation of gsh adducts (9). given the
antioxidant effects of gsh, its restoration becomes
critical in the protection of conceptuses during chemical
induced oxidative stress. as mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, one of the key enzymes responsible for the
maintenance of the reduced form of gsh is the
 xxxd2811xxx -rd enzyme. experiments in our laboratory have
demonstrated the presence of  xxxd2811xxx -rd in the conceptus
in which the enzyme activity is 6 to 8 times higher in the
visceral yolk sac (vys) than in the corresponding
embryo (9). further, inhibition of  xxxd2811xxx -rd by  xxxd444xxx 

introduction
glutathione (gsh) is a predominant endogenous intracellular thiol composed of the amino acids glutamate,
cysteine, and glycine. gsh is found in high concentrations in most animal, plant, and bacterial cells. a notable
function of gsh is in cellular protection against free
radicals and reactive oxygen intermediates (1). several
important enzymes use gsh as a cofactor or cosubstrate
for the purposes of cellular protection and for normal
processing of endogenous substrates. of these, glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) serves an important function
in the protection against oxygen radicals and organic

reproductive toxicology

has been shown to enhance the embryotoxicity elicited
by chemical agents both in vivo and in vitro (9,10). the
activity of  xxxd2811xxx -rd, to a large extent, is dependent on
the availability of the cofactor nadph (11). processes
that decrease the availability of nadph can, in turn,
affect gsh levels leading to toxicity, by preventing
reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  and other forms of oxidized gsh
(12). nadph, nadh, and their oxidized forms belong
to a pool of pyridine nucleotides and are vital for most
catabolic and anabolic functions (13). in normally aerobic tissues such as the liver, nad(h) is found predominantly in the oxidized form, whereas nadp(h) remains
in the reduced form (14,15). although both nadh and
nadph arise from the transfer of electrons to h2
accompanying catabolic processes, nadh is involved in
oxidative phosphorylation and nadph as a reducing
equivalent for numerous biosynthetic reactions including
lipid biosynthesis. the reduced forms of the pyridine
nucleotides emit fluorescence at excitation/emission
wavelengths of 366/455 nm, whereas the oxidized forms
do not.
an alteration in the redox ratio of the pyridine
nucleotides can affect a large number of metabolic
reactions and may be essential to the mechanism of
irreversible cell injury (16). for example, it has been
shown in hepatocytes that an alteration in redox status of
pyridine nucleotides caused by chemicals leads to cytotoxicity (17–19). although a great deal of work has been
conducted to address the effects of chemicals on the
redox status of gsh and/or pyridine nucleotides in adult
cell types, very little is known about these redox changes
in the developing conceptus, especially during conditions
of oxidative stress. the rodent vys has been demonstrated to have a high metabolic and detoxication capacity and is believed to contain cytochrome p450s that also
involve the flux of the pyridine nucleotides. an alteration
in vys functions may adversely affect the embryo by
limiting the supply of precursors and/or cofactors needed
for specific biochemical reactions. we believe that a
dynamic relationship exists between the embryo and its
extra-embryonic membranes and this relationship may
be critical in determining consequences of exposure to
chemicals. therefore, the goal of this study was to
investigate how the pyridine nucleotide flux as measured
from the surface of the vys correlates with changes in
thiol status during chemical exposure in the conceptus
and to determine how these changes affect normal
development in vitro.
in the present study, we have used two model thiol
oxidants, diamide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tbh).
they were chosen on the basis of their different abilities
to oxidize gsh and possibly cause subsequent alterations in pyridine nucleotides. diamide oxidizes gsh to
 xxxd2811xxx  directly without the concomitant formation of

volume 13, number 3, 1999

radicals (20). in addition to its effects on thiol levels,
diamide has also been shown to be embryotoxic in the
organogenesis-stage rat embryo (9). tert-butyl hydroperoxide has been shown to be metabolized by gsh-px to
 xxxd3319xxx  within isolated rat hepatocytes.
this reaction consumes gsh, generating  xxxd2811xxx , which
is reduced to gsh by  xxxd2811xxx -rd, a reaction accompanied
by the oxidation of nadph to nadp1 (12,21,22).
whereas the effects of diamide on morphology and thiol
status in the organogenesis-stage rat conceptus have been
studied and are well documented, the effects of tbh on
the developing conceptus have not been examined.
furthermore, the effects of these model thiol oxidants on
the pyridine nucleotide flux in the organogenesis-stage
rat conceptuses have not been studied. information about
pyridine nucleotides is important because these coenzymes regulate the oxidation reduction activities of the
cell (23). a fundamental question to be answered is
whether changes in pyridine nucleotide flux and gsh
oxidation differ as a result of gsh oxidation per se
(caused by diamide) or as a result of enzymatic gsh
oxidation by gsh-px (tbh). we wanted to determine
whether the changes in the redox status of gsh and
pyridine nucleotides play a role in dysmorphogenesis
caused by chemicals. we believe that an understanding
of the pyridine nucleotide flux during thiol oxidation and
its role in maintaining adequate levels of gsh during
oxidative/chemical insult will provide an indispensable
foundation for the mechanistic understanding of embryotoxicity and dysmorphogenesis.
to better understand the changes in pyridine nucleotide flux, we used a microfiberoptic perifusion system
(mfop) developed by thorsrud and harris (24) as
adapted from ji, lemasters, and thurman (25). this
system is capable of detecting chemical-induced alterations in the pyridine nucleotide status in real time
(24,26). presently, we can monitor the fluorescence of
the reduced pyridine nucleotides from the surface of the
vys. we are currently working on a technology to
monitor the fluorescence from the surface of the vys
and the embryo proper simultaneously. the basic principle of mfop involves the illumination of the surface of
the vys by optical fibers, which excite the reduced
forms of the pyridine nucleotides, causing them to emit
fluorescence (24). we used this noninvasive real time
fluorometric method to study the effects of these two
thiol oxidants on the redox status of the rat conceptus
during organogenesis. to correlate the qualitative
changes in pyridine nucleotide flux caused by tbh with
thiol oxidation, we used a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) method to measure gsh and
 xxxd2811xxx , both in the embryo and the vys. we believe that
biochemical alterations in the vys may ultimately affect
the integrity of the embryo. the effects of diamide on

nad(p)h flux and gsh oxidation ● s. s. akella

thiol status have been studied previously and are not
included in this study. finally, we chose concentrations
that caused dysmorphogenic effects in the organogenesis-stage rat conceptus without significantly affecting
viability, to have a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms that underlie dysmorphogenesis.
materials and methods
animals
time-mated primagravida sprague dawley rats
were used in all experiments. animals were obtained on
day 7 to 9 of gestation from the university of michigan
p-30 core laboratory and maintained in the animal room
until explantation. all animals had access to food and
water ad libitum and were maintained on a 12-h light,
12-h dark cycle. pregnancy was confirmed the following
morning by the presence of a sperm-positive vaginal
smear and that day was considered as day 0 of gestation.
chemicals
diamide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). 1,3,
bis-(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea was obtained from
bristol myers (syracuse, ny). hanks’ balanced salt
solution (hbss) and earle’s  xxxd2988xxx 
(ebss) were purchased from life technologies brl
(grand island, ny). the buffers were prepared as
previously described (24).
whole rat embryo culture
dams were anesthetized with ether on gd 10,
which is midgestation for rats and is the period during
which organogenesis takes place. blood was collected
from the abdominal aorta, centrifuged, and  xxxd187xxx  and
the clot removed. serum obtained was then heat inactivated at 55°c for 30 min for use in the culture medium.
uteri were removed from the dams and placed in a sterile
plastic dish containing sterile hanks  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) adjusted to ph 7.4 by sodium bicarbonate
(7.5% w/v). each implantation site was removed from
the uterus and the decidua and riechert’s membrane
were removed to allow the conceptus (which includes the
embryo, the vys, and the amnion) to expand as it grows
in the culture medium. the conceptuses used in each
experiment were carefully selected to be at the same
stage of development having open neural tubes, dorsal
flexure, and approximately 10 to 14 somites. conceptuses were cultured in 100-ml culture bottles in medium
consisting of 33% heat inactivated serum and sterile
hbss with potassium  xxxd2871xxx  (100 iu/ml) and
streptomycin (50 mg/ml) in a total medium volume of
10 ml. the culture medium was previously warmed and

saturated with 20% o2: 5% co2: 75% n2. chemicals
were added directly to the culture medium.
dose response and morphologic assessment
morphologic assessment was performed under the
dissecting microscope on the afternoon of gd 11. the
conceptuses had been in culture medium for 24 to 26 h.
viability was determined by observing the presence of a
heartbeat and an active vitelline yolk sac circulation.
only viable conceptuses were used for subsequent morphologic and biochemical analyses. the conceptuses
were evaluated for growth parameters such as crown–
rump length, degree of axial rotation, closure of neural
tube, and other obvious dysmorphogenic effects. after
the morphological assessments, the embryos and the
vys were separated and stored at 270°c for subsequent
protein/dna or biochemical analysis.
rat conceptuses were exposed to 250, 500, and
1000 mm tbh for 5 min and 500 mm tbh for 15 min in
the culture medium. these concentrations were chosen
based on a preliminary literature search (12,27,28),
where studies were performed using cell cultures. we
have, however, adapted these concentrations and/or exposure periods for use in our whole embryo culture
systems. for subsequent studies, 500 mm was chosen
because it caused dysmorphogenesis without significantly affecting viability of the conceptuses after an
acute exposure. after exposure to the chemicals, the
conceptuses were removed from the medium, washed
free of the chemical, and grown in fresh culture medium
for 24 h at which time they were evaluated for morphologic changes and malformations, as described previously (9).
the conceptuses were exposed to 25 mm  xxxd444xxx  (a
concentration that has been shown to cause maximum
inhibition of  xxxd2811xxx -rd activity without significantly
affecting the viability of the conceptuses) in the culture
medium for 2 h. conceptuses were then washed free of
the chemical and reintroduced in fresh culture medium
where they were exposed to tbh (500 mm). conceptuses
were subsequently washed and cultured in fresh media
for 24 h, at which time they were assessed for morphologic effects.
determination of protein and dna
frozen tissues (embryos and the vys) were thawed
and ultrasonically disrupted before analysis. protein
content was determined using the method of bradford
(29) as modified for use with a 96-well plate and
analyzed in a microtitre plate spectrophotometer. each
well contained 15 ml tissue homogenate and 200 ml
protein reagent (biorad protein reagent, 1:5 dilution). a
standard curve was prepared in the same manner using
the appropriate amount of protein standard (bovine

206

reproductive toxicology

plasma gamma globulin or bovine  xxxg124xxx ) in a
15-ml volume. dna was determined using the method
of labarca and paigen (30).
microfiberoptic perifusion system (mfop)
the development and construction of the mfop
system is described by thorsrud and harris (24). the
basic principle involves placing the tip of a fiberoptic
sensor on the surface of the vys to monitor the
endogenous fluorescence signal from nad(p)h at an
excitation/emission spectrum of 366/455 nm in real time.
before fluorescence monitoring, the conceptuses were
maintained in rat whole embryo culture as described
previously (24). just before fiberoptic evaluation a conceptus was carefully removed from culture and placed in
the mfop chamber. baseline fluorescence readings were
obtained during a 15-min equilibration period, after
which a manually controlled t-valve was used to switch
to the test solutions (diamide and tbh) for 5 min. after
exposure to the chemical, the apparatus was switched
back to control perifusate (ebss). the exposure to the
chemicals was limited to 5 min because we were interested in evaluating acute exposures. moreover, the perifusion system would not sustain the conceptus for long
periods. for  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment, the conceptuses were
exposed to  xxxd444xxx  25 mm for 2 h in culture medium.
they were subsequently introduced into the mfop
chamber and exposed to tbh as described in the previous
section. the fluorescence signal was measured in arbitrary fluorescence units (afu) (1 afu 5 1 mm length
on the strip chart recorder). afus were measured and
standardized to a 1-mm per 30 mvolt deflection on the
chart paper.
hplc analysis of gsh and  xxxd2811xxx 
sample preparation. gestational day 10 (somite
number 10 to 15) rat conceptuses were grown using
standard culture conditions for 1 h at 37°c. treatment
groups were exposed to either (a)  xxxd444xxx  25 mm for 2 h,
(b)  xxxd444xxx  (2-h pretreatment) and tbh 500 mm (5 min),
(c) tbh (250, 500, and 1000 mm) alone for 5 min, or (d)
500 mm tbh alone for 3 and 15 min. the concentrations
and exposure periods chosen for the gsh analysis were
similar to those used in the mfop system. four embryos
or vyss were stored in 400 ml of 200 mm  xxxd390xxx  acid buffer and frozen at 270°c for further
analysis. care was taken to ensure that conceptuses of
similar developmental stage were grouped together.
oxidized and reduced thiols were measured by
hplc after monobromobimane (mbbr) derivatization
(31). thawed embryos and vys were homogenized by
ultrasonic disruption. an equal volume of 4 m sodium
methane sulfonate was added and protein was precipi-

volume 13, number 3, 1999

tated by centrifugation. the supernatant was removed.
half of the supernatant was transferred to a new microfuge tube containing hepps buffer (to bring the ph
to 8.0). these samples were used to measure the naturally reduced form of gsh. the other half of the
supernatant was transferred to a new microfuge tube
containing 3.5 mm dtt in hepps. these tubes were
incubated in a circulating water bath at 37°c for 30 min.
these samples were used to measure total reduced gsh.
the calculated difference between the two results represents the  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) in the sample.
monobromobimane (mbbr) was then added to a final
concentration of 0.2 mm and the reaction was allowed to
proceed for 20 min in the dark at room temperature.
finally, 400 mm msa was added to acidify the samples,
which were then stored in the dark at 270°c until hplc
analysis. the thiol values were calculated as pmol gsh
or  xxxd2811xxx /embryo or vys.
statistical analysis
for parametric data, statistical differences between
control and treatment groups were determined using
analysis of variance (anova). wherever appropriate,
student’s t-test, dunn’s test or tukey’s test was used to
determine differences between groups. for nonparametric data, statistical differences between control and treatment groups were determined using chi square or fisher
exact tests. differences were considered statistically
significant when p , 0.05.
results
morphology and viability assessment of gd 11.5
conceptuses was conducted with conceptuses exposed to
tbh for 5 min on gd 10.5 and grown in culture medium
for 24 h. tert-butyl hydroperoxide (1000 mm) reduced
viability to 52%, whereas 250 and 500 mm tbh did not
affect viability significantly (table 1). tert-butyl hydroperoxide (250, 500, and 1000 mm) also caused a
disruption in the normal dorsal-to-ventral axial rotation,
usually seen during this stage of development, with
effects most prominent at 1000 mm. tert-butyl hydroperoxide at any concentration investigated did not adversely
affect neural tube closure in the embryo, although it
caused a decrease in crown rump length at 500 mm. in
our experiments,  xxxd444xxx  treatment did not significantly
affect the viability of the embryos. in fact,  xxxd444xxx  when
combined with tbh (1000 mm) increased viability when
compared with tbh alone.  xxxd444xxx , when administered
alone, significantly increased the incidence of abnormal
flexure in the conceptuses. on the contrary, when combined with tbh it did not affect the normal dorsal-toventral axial rotation significantly and was beneficial
when compared with tbh (1000 mm) alone. 1,3, bis-(2

a

chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea pretreatment did not affect the
closure of the neural tubes in the embryos, although it
reduced crown rump lengths significantly when given in
combination with tbh (500 mm and 1000 mm). all
treatment groups exhibited prosencephalic hypoplasia
and reduced blood circulation in the vyss. the morphologic effects of a 15-min exposure to tbh were similar to
a 5-min exposure (results not shown).
conceptuses exposed to tbh (250, 500 and 1000
mm) for 5 min exhibited decreases in protein and dna
content after 24 h of culture (table 2). tert-butyl hydroperoxide (500 mm) caused 17% decreases in protein
in both embryo and vys, and was further reduced after
exposure to 1000 mm tbh in the embryo. significant
decreases in dna were seen in the embryo at 250 and
1000 mm tbh and in the vys at 1000 mm tbh. when
conceptuses were incubated in the presence of tbh for
15 min, no significant differences were noted from the
5-min response except for a 30 to 45% decrease in vys
protein and dna. for clarity, only the 5-min protein and
dna data are shown in table 2. when given alone, a 2-h
exposure to  xxxd444xxx  decreased protein and dna content
in the embryos. the vyss were not affected. however
when given in combination with a 5-min exposure to
tbh (250 mm), dna was decreased significantly in the
embryos and the vyss with respect to controls (23 and
26%, respectively). 1,3, bis-(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea with tbh (500 mm) decreased protein by 25%
and 16% in embryos and dna by 40% and 18% in the
vyss. the effects of  xxxd444xxx  with tbh (1000 mm) were
more pronounced. protein contents in embryos decreased

a

by 40% and 57%, whereas dna contents decreased by
18% and 32% with respect to controls.
based on the dose response data, a concentration of
500 mm tbh was selected for subsequent studies as it
produced dysmorphogenic effects in the organogenesisstage rat conceptus without affecting its viability.
the mfop system was used to qualitatively assess
the effects of diamide and tbh on the pyridine nucleotide
flux. two types of studies were employed using the
mfop system. in the first study the conceptuses were
exposed to the lowest concentration of diamide or tbh
used for 5 min and the effects were recorded. once the
readings/tracings approached pre-exposure levels or if a
steady baseline was obtained, the conceptus was exposed
to the next higher concentration of the chemical for 5
min. diamide at 125 and 250 mm caused a decrease in
fluorescence by 14 and 32 afu in gd 10 embryos. an
additional exposure to 500 mm diamide caused a smaller
decrease followed by a 20-afu increase in fluorescence
(figure 1). tert-butyl hydroperoxide (250 and 500 mm)
produced a decrease by 12 and 6 afu. unlike diamide,
the rebound increase was observed at the lowest concentration itself; the fluorescence effects were greatly attenuated at 1000 mm (figure 2). thus while the decrease in
fluorescence caused by diamide and tbh were qualitatively similar, there was variability in the rebound
increase.
in the second study, exposure to tbh (500 mm)
alone and the effects of  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment on tbh were
evaluated. the latter experiment was performed to de-

termine the role of the  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway in the regeneration of gsh on exposure to a thiol oxidant. tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (500 mm) caused a decrease in fluorescence by 14 afu followed by a rebound increase by 8
afu (figure 3). 1,3, bis-(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea
pretreatment attenuated this decrease in fluorescence
from 14 afu to 6 afu (figure 4). the effects of  xxxd444xxx 
pretreatment on the increase in fluorescence were variable. in some conceptuses  xxxd444xxx  did not seem to affect
the rebound increase caused by tbh, whereas in others it
inhibited the increase in fluorescence. the mfop data
are summarized in table 3.
to assess the relationship between altered pyridine
nucleotides and gsh status, conceptuses were exposed
to tbh (500 mm) (a concentration that was chosen based
on dose response studies) in culture and samples were
analyzed for oxidized and reduced thiol levels 3, 5, and
15 min after exposure. the effects of diamide, with and
without  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment, on gsh have been studied

and documented (9) and thus were not included in our
experiments. gd 10 control embryos and vyss had
634 6 65 and 616 6 65 pmol gsh respectively. there
was a significant decrease in gsh concentrations when
the conceptuses were treated with tbh (500 mm). in the
embryos, gsh values dropped by 31%, 32%, and 45%
with respect to controls at 3, 5, and 15 min respectively.
the effects in the vys were more pronounced. gsh
values dropped by 41%, 55%, and 58% with respect to
controls at 3, 5, and 15 min respectively (figure 5).
conceptuses were also analyzed for  xxxd2811xxx 
( xxxd2811xxx ) levels (figure 6). control gd 10 embryos and
vyss had low but more greatly variable  xxxd2811xxx  levels
(89 6 56 and 79 6 58 pmol respectively). these levels
increased when the conceptuses were exposed to tbh.
the pattern of increase varied in the embryos and vyss.
the embryos showed a steady increase in  xxxd2811xxx  with
increasing exposures to tbh. at the end of 3 min,  xxxd2811xxx 
values were not different from controls. the values

15 min. in the vys, however,  xxxd2811xxx  values increased by
250% with respect to control at the end of 3 min. at the
end of 5 min the  xxxd2811xxx  values were still higher than
controls but were only 16% higher than controls. at the
end of 15 min, the values again increased by 310% with
respect to controls. the redox ratio (gsh/ xxxd2811xxx ) decreased with increasing exposures to tbh. control embryos and vyss had a ratio of 7 (figure 7). this ratio
dropped by 90% with respect to controls at the end of a
15-min exposure to tbh. the effect of  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment with tbh (500 mm) on gsh levels was studied in
gd 10 conceptuses. 1,3, bis-(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea caused a decrease in gsh very similar to that
produced by tbh alone. conceptuses were also exposed
to  xxxd444xxx  and tbh or tbh alone on gd 10 and cultured
for 24 h in a chemical-free medium.  xxxd2213xxx 
levels in tbh-treated conceptuses at the end of 24 h were
comparable with controls. however,  xxxd444xxx  pretreatment
caused a sustained decrease in gsh in embryos (figure

discussion
although tbh has been shown to be a thiol and
nadph oxidant in various cell types (12,32), its effect
on the developing conceptus has not been studied. a
preliminary dose response evaluation in our laboratory
revealed that a 5-min exposure to 500 mm tbh caused
dysmorphogenic effects in gd 10 to 11 conceptuses
without significantly affecting their viability. this con-

centration of tbh also caused a decrease in fluorescence
in isolated hepatocytes that was attributed to the use of
nadph by the  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway (12). in our mfop
experiments, both tbh and diamide produced a reproducible decrease in fluorescence followed by a subsequent increase. we hypothesized that since tbh and
diamide are gsh oxidants, this decrease in fluorescence
in the vys was attributable to an activation of the
 xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway (thereby using nadph) to regener-

volume 13, number 3, 1999

ate gsh from  xxxd2811xxx . our results with diamide confirm
and extend previous findings where diamide at 250 and
500 mm concentrations caused rapid depletion of gsh
(50% of control) and a significant increase in  xxxd2811xxx  (9).
moreover, inhibition of  xxxd2811xxx -rd activity by  xxxd444xxx  in
the conceptuses before diamide addition further reduced
gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratios and potentiated embryotoxicity, implying the importance of utilization of nadph for the
regeneration of gsh during diamide exposure (9). gsh/
 xxxd2811xxx  ratios in adult tissues such as the rat liver and
kidney, and maternal mouse liver were found to be 14,
40, and 38, respectively (33). when compared with these
adult tissues, the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio in the rat conceptus is
quite low. thus, even a small pertubation in this ratio by
toxicants may have long-lasting effects. therefore, the
restoration of gsh homeostasis becomes important during chemical exposure. we also used  xxxd444xxx  in our
experiments to establish the contribution of a nadphdependent  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway during gsh oxidation by
tbh. pretreatment with  xxxd444xxx  significantly attenuated
the decrease in fluorescence caused by tbh alone,
implicating the activation of  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathways during
gsh oxidation by tbh in the developing conceptus. the
sequence of events observed from the surface of the vys
by the mfop system is consistent with changes in
reduced and oxidized thiol levels measured in the conceptus upon exposure to tbh. glutathione levels decreased with respect to controls in the embryos and
vyss, with the maximum decrease observed at 15 min.
there was a corresponding increase in  xxxd2811xxx . to determine if acute exposures to tbh caused longer term
changes in thiol status, gd 10 conceptuses were exposed
to tbh and cultured for 24 h in a chemical-free medium.

conceptuses. embryos and vyss were exposed to  xxxd444xxx  for
2 h followed by tbh (500 mm) for 5 min on gd 10. embryos
and vyss were subsequently washed and cultured in fresh
media for 24 h. values represent mean 6 sem. asterisks
indicate a significant difference from control values (p , 0.05).

glutathione levels in the embryos and vyss, measured
after 24 h, were comparable to controls indicating an
extended augmentation of gsh stores. in contrast,
 xxxd444xxx  pretreatment on gd 10 did not replenish gsh
stores in the embryos after 24 h. 1,3, bis-(2 chloroethyl)1-nitrosourea, by inhibiting  xxxd2811xxx -rd, probably prevented the utilization of nadph and hence the regeneration of gsh from its oxidized form in the embryo.
during gsh oxidation, both de novo gsh synthesis and
 xxxd2811xxx  reduction by  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway are important in
maintaining gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  redox status. whereas the decreased levels of gsh in the embryo on gd 11 after
 xxxd444xxx  pretreatment can be attributed to slower de novo
synthesis (3), decreased amounts of  xxxd2811xxx -rd enzyme in
the embryo compared to vys may also be a contributing
factor. in fact, the embryo has approximately seven times
less  xxxd2811xxx -rd activity than the vys (9). the effects of
 xxxd444xxx  pretreatment on  xxxd2811xxx  levels were not determined. based on our hypothesis, it would be reasonable
to assume that  xxxd444xxx  would cause a further increase in
 xxxd2811xxx  as compared to tbh alone. although  xxxd444xxx 
pretreatment caused a sustained decrease in gsh in
embryos on gd 11, it did not potentiate the toxicity of
tbh, contrary to published literature (21). in fact,  xxxd444xxx 
in combination with tbh (1000 mm) increased viability
and decreased rotation defects when compared to tbh
alone. at this point, we do not understand this paradox
and the mechanistic implications of this observation.
whereas there is a decrease in gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio on
exposure to  xxxd444xxx , there is a subsequent increase in
nadph. it is possible that this increased availability of
nadph after  xxxd2811xxx -rd inhibition by  xxxd444xxx  is contributing to the decreased toxicity.

both diamide and tbh caused a rebound increase in
surface fluorescence after the initial decrease was observed. we believe that the variability in the magnitude
of increase may be due to the different mechanisms of
action of the two chemicals. one of the explanations for
the increase is a rise in nadh subsequent to mitochondrial dysfunction upon exposure to an oxidant. we
observe such an increase in fluorescence in the vys
when we make the conceptuses hypoxic and/or when we
expose them to cyanide (24,26). diamide directly oxidizes gsh and does not consume oxygen. tbh, on the
other hand, is metabolized through a peroxidative mechanism and consumes oxygen during the course of its
metabolism, making the conceptus hypoxic. this difference may explain why we observe a rebound increase
with the lowest concentration of tbh while we observe
this rebound only with the highest concentration of
diamide. the increase in fluorescence can also be attributable to nadph or a combination of nadh and
nadph. because the mfop cannot distinguish between
fluorescence patterns of nadh and nadph, we propose to measure the pyridine nucleotides quantitatively
to establish causality.
we have several hypotheses to explain the increase
in fluorescence. the increase can be attributable to
activation of pathways leading to reduction of nadp1.
one of the pathways responsible for this reaction is the
pentose phosphate pathway (ppp). this pathway is
stimulated in tissues exposed to oxidants such as diamide,  xxxd2298xxx , and tbh (1,9,12). although
the presence of an active ppp has been demonstrated in
the rat conceptus (9,34), the effects of chemicals on this
pathway have not been explored in great detail. in
addition to the ppp, other possible pathways responsible
for the reduction of nadp1 during chemical-induced
oxidative stress include the malate and isocitrate shuttles
(11). although the presence of these pathways has not
yet been demonstrated in the organogenesis-stage rat
conceptus, we suggest that one of the critical functions of
the conceptus in supporting the metabolism of chemicals
such as tbh and other gsh oxidants and, at the same
time, avoiding cell injury, may be an ability to maintain
adequate supplies of nadph. it remains to be seen,
however, which pathway is used by the conceptus during
chemical insult in an effort to generate nadph and
through  xxxd2811xxx -rd, maintain gsh levels.
measurement of pyridine nucleotides in gd 10 and
11 vyss revealed that the predominant pyridine nucleotide on both days was nad1, whereas nadph/
nadp1 was relatively low on gd 10 (26). activation of
nadph dependent  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathway to restore gsh
levels can quickly deplete nadph stores. this depletion
may be of significance in the gd 10 conceptus where
low levels of nadp1 may be the limiting factor in the

212

reproductive toxicology

generation of nadph. the conceptus will then have to
rely on new synthesis of nadp1. nad1 kinase catalyzes the synthesis of nadp1 (which is subsequently
reduced) by the atp-linked phosphorylation of nad1.
nad1 kinase is the only known enzyme that catalyzes
the biochemical reaction for the synthesis of nadp1 and
its activity has been demonstrated in the adult rodent
liver and sea urchin eggs immediately after fertilization
(35–37). nad1 kinase may play a vital role in the
regulation of pyridine nucleotides in the developing
conceptus and thus its measurement in the organogenesis
stage embryo during chemical induced oxidative stress
might provide useful insights into the generation and use
of pyridine nucleotides during chemical insult.
as mentioned earlier in this section, the increase in
fluorescence can also be attributed to an increase in
nadh as a consequence of a disruption in mitochondrial
function and an alteration in oxidative phosphorylation
leading to decreased energy production. to determine if
there was a disturbance in energy production during an
acute exposure, the conceptuses were evaluated for
alterations in atp levels. the atp levels in the embryos
and vys after a 5-min and a 15-min exposure to tbh
were not significantly different from the controls (results
not shown). this finding indicates that a short-term
exposure does not compromise energy functions in the
conceptus. alternately, it is possible that while atp
levels do not change drastically in whole conceptuses,
the levels in the mitochondria might be altered suggesting a disruption in oxidative phosphorylation. imberti et
al. (27) demonstrated that a low concentration of tbh (25
to 50 mm) inhibited mitochondrial atp generation in
hepatocytes with consequent cellular atp depletion.
further, 100 mm tbh affected mitochondrial membrane
potential within 10 min. it is thus reasonable to expect
that at the concentration of tbh that we used, mitochondrial function might be affected within as little as 5 min.
our results demonstrate that while diamide and tbh
oxidize gsh by different mechanisms, both chemicals
cause the subsequent oxidation of nadph through the
activity of  xxxd2811xxx -rd pathways in an effort to maintain
gsh homeostasis. the changes in the pyridine nucleotide flux observed in the vys correlate with the perturbation of thiol status both in the embryo and vys. we do
not know whether the dysmorphogenic effects seen in
the embryo are a direct consequence of the biochemical
changes that occur in the embryo and vys. however,
our results do suggest that the dynamic relationship
between the embryo and the vys maybe critical in
determining consequences of exposure to chemicals.
future experiments will be conducted to better define the
role of pyridine nucleotides in maintaining thiol levels
and its importance during chemical-induced oxidative
stress in the conceptus during organogenesis.
