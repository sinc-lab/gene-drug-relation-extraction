interferon treatment of renal cell carcinoma. current status and future prospects.  studies with various  xxxg1137xxx  preparations, including interferons induced in human leukocytes,  xxxd2367xxx ,  xxxd2365xxx , and  xxxd2366xxx , have all provided evidence for modest but reproducible antitumor activity in advanced renal cell carcinoma. review of the data suggests that maximal response rates are achieved when  xxxg1137xxx  is administered within a fairly restricted range of moderate to high doses, whereas extremely low or extremely high dosage regimens appear less likely to induce therapeutic response. preliminary evidence suggests that interferons beta and gamma may also induce regression of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. recent in vitro and animal studies have shown that combinations of  xxxg1141xxx  with  xxxg1137xxx  or  xxxg1140xxx , produce synergistic biologic activities, suggesting that the various interferons may have different pathways of action related to agent-specific cellular receptors. possible interactions of different interferon species given concurrently to patients with renal cell carcinoma are under investigation, as are combinations of  xxxg1137xxx  with chemotherapeutic agents. despite in vitro data suggesting enhanced antiproliferative activity for the combination of  xxxg1137xxx  and vinblastine, most clinical studies of this combination have proved to be no more effective than  xxxg1137xxx  alone, but they have provided evidence of increased toxicity. the recent identification and purification of other biologically active cytokines, such as  xxxg2296xxx  and interleukin-2, and of monoclonal antibodies that recognize unique cell surface antigens on renal carcinoma cells, provide exciting possibilities for combination regimens with various interferon species.
