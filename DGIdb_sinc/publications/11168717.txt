aims: the aim of this work was to demonstrate that strains of lactobacillus may be able to
produce putrescine and  xxxd94xxx  from one of the major amino acids present in fruit juices and
wine, arginine, and from amino acid-derived ornithine.
methods and results: biogenic amines were determined by hplc. their production in the
culture medium was similar under both microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions. the
presence of mn2+ had a minimal in¯uence on the results, whereas the addition of pyridoxal
phosphate increased amine production 10-fold. lactobacillus hilgardii x1b, isolated from wine,
was able to degrade arginine by two pathways: arginine deiminase and  xxxg232xxx .
the isolate was able to produce putrescine from ornithine and from  xxxd94xxx . lactobacillus
plantarum strains n4 and n8, isolated from orange, utilized arginine via the arginine deiminase
system. only the n4 strain was able to produce putrescine from ornithine.
conclusions: it has been demonstrated that lact. hilgardii x1b is able to produce the most
important biogenic amine found in wine, putrescine, and also  xxxd94xxx  from arginine and
ornithine, and that lactobacillus plantarum, considered to be an innocuous spoilage microorganism in fruit juices, is able to produce amines.
signi®cance and impact of the study: the results have signi®cance in relation to food
poisoning caused by beverages that have been contaminated with biogenic amines.

introduction
biogenic amines, low molecular weight organic bases, can be
formed and degraded as a result of normal metabolic activity
in animals, plants and micro-organisms. these amines occur
in a wide variety of foods, such ®sh products, meat, cheese,
wine and other fermented foods (vidal-carou et al. 1990;
izquierdo-pulido et al. 1994). the amines are usually
produced in foods by decarboxylation of amino acids
(halaâsz et al. 1994). amino acids are naturally present in
grapes, representing 30±40% of the total wine nitrogen.
amine production has been associated with protective
mechanisms of micro-organisms against an acidic environment (vandekerckove 1977). toxicological problems may
result from the ingestion of foods containing relatively high
levels of biogenic amines, and may provoke hypertensive
crises in patients treated with monoaminoxidase inhibitors drugs (maoi). putrescine and  xxxd94xxx  have been

described as potentiators that enhance the toxicity of
histamine to humans by depressing histamine oxidation
(taylor 1986). in addition, putrescine and  xxxd94xxx  may
originate carcinogenic nitrosamines in the presence of
1 nitrites (hotchkiss et al. 1977; vandekerckove 1977).
halaâsz et al. (1994) reported preliminary results suggesting
that a positive correlation exists between the micro¯ora and
the putrescine concentration in vegetables.
lactic acid bacteria able to grow in acidic fruit juice and
wine are generally recognized as safe. however, the
metabolic activity of the lactic acid bacteria involved may
also give rise to the formation of biogenic amines. the
potential of selected strains to produce the biogenic amines
 xxxd94xxx  and putrescine from the arginine, and its amino
acid derivative, ornithine, needs to be investigated.
some lactic acid bacteria are known to degrade l-arginine
(manca de nadra et al. 1981, 1982, 1986, 1988), one of the
major amino acids found in orange and grape juices and
wines. in addition, manca de nadra et al. (1997, 1999)
reported that the protease produced by oenococcus
oeni, isolated from argentinean wine, is effective on the

nitrogenous macromolecular fraction of white and red wines,
and that arginine is quantitatively one of the most important
amino acids obtained by protease activity.
in previous papers, it was determined that arginine
metabolism in lactobacillus plantarum n4 and n8 strains
2 isolated from orange juice (arena et al. 1999a), and
lactobacillus hilgardii x1b isolated form wine (arena et al.
3 1999b), takes place via the arginine deiminase pathway
(adi). the arginase±urease system was not detected.
arginine could be decomposed to putrescine via citrulline
4 and ornithine, or could be decarboxylated to  xxxd94xxx ,
forming putrescine directly or via n-carbamoylputrescine.
in this study, the ability of lactobacillus strains, isolated
from orange and grape juices, to produce amines from
arginine and ornithine precursors was examined. the
pathway for putrescine and  xxxd94xxx  production was also
investigated.
materials and methods
organisms
lactobacillus hilgardii x1b was isolated from argentinean
wine (strasser de saad and manca de nadra 1987).
lactobacillus plantarum strains n4 and n8 were isolated
from orange (arena et al. 1996).
media, growth conditions and culture procedures
moeller's decarboxylase medium was used as the basal
medium (bm). the bm contained, in g l±1: 5, peptone
(oxoid); 3, yeast extract (oxoid); 1, glucose (oxoid); 0á005,
pyridoxal-5-phosphate (sigma); and 0á016, bromocresol
purple (sigma) as the ph dye indicator.
amino acid decarboxylation was tested by adding to bm
1 g l±1 of either l-arginine-hydrochloride (sigma), or l(+)ornithine-monohydrochloride (merck). the effect of mn2+
was tested by adding 0á03 g l±1 mnso4 (sigma). the media
were adjusted to ph 6á5 with naoh and sterilized at 121°c
for 15 min.  xxxd94xxx  and putrescine were from sigma.
the strains were pre-cultured in bm and then inoculated
into experimental media at 5 ´ 107 cells ml±1. these cultures were incubated statically at 30°c for 10 days under
microaerophilic or anaerobic (by overlaying with paraf®n)
conditions.
analytical methods
the concentration of amino acids was measured as described
previously (arena et al. 1999a,b). biogenic amines were
determined by a liquid chromatographic method as described by eerola et al. (1993). some additional changes were
made, such as the inclusion of one more biogenic amine

159

( xxxd94xxx ).  xxxd94xxx  eluted between cadaverine and histamine. the solvents used for the separation were solvent a:
0á1 m ammonium acetate and solvent b: acetonitrile.
solvent gradient conditions began with 50% b and ended
with 90% b in 19 min. the total run time was 35 min
including the washing time. washing was essential to
maintain column performance. the samples were derivatized prior to column injection as follows. dansyl derivatives were generated with the addition of 100 ll 2n sodium
hydroxide solution, 150 ll saturated sodium bicarbonate
and dansyl chloride solution (5 mg dansyl chloride in 0á5 ml
acetone). the reaction mixture was incubated at 40°c for
45 min. after incubation, the residual dansyl chloride was
removed by addition of 50 ll ammonia. after 20 min, the
sample was adjusted to 2á5 ml with acetonitrile and then
®ltered with a 0á22 lm ®lter. chromatographic separation
5 was performed on an o.d.s2 column (phenomenex,
torrance, usa) 300 nm long ´ 4á6 nm i.d. the precolumn derivatization and the column apparatus were at
40°c. the ¯ow rate was 1 ml min±1 and the column ef¯uent
was monitored at 254 nm using a gilson 118 (gilson
6 medical electronics, middleton, usa). 1,7-diaminoheptane
was used as internal standard for quanti®cation.
statistical analysis
to validate the methods, the student's test was used.
three replicate determinations were carried out.
results
biogenic amine production from arginine and ornithine by
lact. hilgardii x1b and lact. plantarum n4 and n8 strains is
shown in table 1. the concentration of amino acids has an
effect on the overall formation of biogenic amines. a
concentration of 1 g l±1 of amino acid was selected as in
wine, amounts from 0á1 to 2á3 g l±1 are generally available
for lab metabolism. lactobacillus hilgardii x1b produced
 xxxd94xxx  and putrescine from arginine and ornithine.
lactobacillus plantarum n4 and n8 strains did not produce
 xxxd94xxx  from arginine or ornithine. only the n4 strain was
able to produce putrescine from arginine and ornithine at a
lower concentration than that produced by lact. hilgardii
x1b in the same conditions.
table 2 shows the correlation between arginine consumption by lactobacillus strains and citrulline, ornithine and
biogenic amine excretion into the medium. during growth
of lact. hilgardii x1b, arginine concentration declined while
citrulline, ornithine and biogenic amines increased. after
10 days of incubation at 30°c, 85á4 and 90% of total
arginine present in the medium was consumed under
microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. at
the same time, citrulline and ornithine (via the adi

biogenic amine excretion into the medium. after 10 days of
incubation of lact. hilgardii x1b, ornithine concentration
declined signi®cantly while biogenic amines increased; 77
and 71á3% of the total ornithine present in the medium was
consumed under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions,
respectively. at the same time, citrulline and arginine
(anabolic system; bringel et al. 1997), and  xxxd94xxx  and
putrescine (by decarboxylation) were formed. under
microaerophilic conditions, 20á3% of ornithine consumed
was transformed into citrulline and 10á4% was transformed
into arginine; under anaerobic conditions, the percent of
recovery was 35á1 and 23á6 for citrulline and arginine,
respectively. the arginine produced from ornithine was the
 xxxd94xxx  precursor. the production of biogenic amines
from ornithine under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions was 64á3 and 40á9%.
lactobacillus plantarum n4 consumed 35á9 and 32á9%
of ornithine under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, and was recovered as citrulline, 43á2

respectively.
only 4 and 2á7% of the initial ornithine concentration was
consumed by lact. plantarum n8 strain under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. no biogenic
amines were produced.

discussion
biogenic amine formation is a protective mechanism
for bacteria against acidic environments. according to
masson et al. (1996), ph measurement seems to give a
satisfactory indication of biogenic amine production by
lab. lactobacillus hilgardii x1b and lact. plantarum n4
strain may have adapted to the fruit juice environment,
inducing the cells to protect themselves against the acidic
environment by producing amines.
the capacity of lact. hilgardii x1b to produce biogenic
amines has been demonstrated. independently of microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions, lact. hilgardii x1b produces
 xxxd94xxx  and putrescine in high concentrations. putrescine
is formed by the decarboxylation of either ornithine or
arginine into  xxxd94xxx , which is then converted into
putrescine either directly or indirectly via carbamoylputrescine. lactobacillus hilgardii x1b produces 192±323 mg l±1 of
putrescine under anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions
respectively. putrescine is the most abundant biogenic amine
in wines. amounts of 15±20 and 20±30 mg l±1 in white and
red wines, respectively, are able to produce an important
diminution in sensorial quality. amines are present at higher
concentrations in red wine than in white wine. it is thought
that red wine has a great diversity of amine-producing
micro-organisms such as lab, due to the process of
fermentation. many authors have attributed the formation of
amines to yeast and malolactic or other lab (baucom and
8 tabacchi 1986). previously, buteau et al. (1984) questioned
the formation of biogenic amines to be the result of the
controlled malolactic ¯ora action; they attributed it mainly
to the yeast action. sou¯eros et al. (1998) suggest that during
malolactic fermentation carried out by indigenous lab, the
concentration of biogenic amines increases. according to
andersson (1988), only small amounts of biogenic amines
could be detected in fermentation products following
inoculation of vegetables with lact. plantarum. from the
present results, it can be assumed that lact. plantarum n8
did not represent a hazard for amine production in orange

juice, but lact. plantarum n4 produced putrescine from
arginine and ornithine (0á6±4á4% of turnover). consistent
with these results, straub et al. (1995) reported that low
amounts of putrescine were formed by a few strains of lact.
plantarum (1á0±4á4% of turnover). on the other hand,
9 leuschner and hammes (1999) reported that lact. plantarum isolated from natee is unable to produce putrescine.
in conclusion, lactobacillus strains are considered to be
generally safe. however, it has been demonstrated that lact.
hilgardii x1b isolated from wine, and lact. plantarum n4
strain usually considered as an innocuous spoilage organism
in fruit juices, are able to produce biogenic amines from one
of the major amino acids found in fruit juices and wine,
arginine and its amino acid-derived ornithine.
