abstract
a  xxxg89xxx  to niacin ( xxxd2715xxx ) was identiﬁed recently but the physiological/pharmacological role of the
receptor remains poorly deﬁned. we present our studies to demonstrate that  xxxg1026xxx , but not  xxxg1027xxx , binds niacin at high aﬃnities
and eﬀectively mediates gi signaling events in human embryonic kidney hek293 cells as well as in 3t3l1 adipocytes expressing
 xxxg1026xxx . furthermore,  xxxg1026xxx , but not  xxxg1027xxx , expressed in diﬀerentiated 3t3l1 adipocytes eﬀectively mediated inhibition of
lipolysis by niacin. our results provided direct evidence indicating that  xxxg1026xxx , but not  xxxg1027xxx , was suﬃcient to mediate anti-lipolytic eﬀect of niacin in adipose tissue.

niacin is one of the most prescribed medications for
the treatment of dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease. it is currently the most eﬀective agent in elevating
hdl cholesterol while also lowering ldl cholesterol
and plasma triglycerides. its eﬀective use is limited by
its side-eﬀects, most notably ﬂushing [1]. in addition,
the mechanisms behind its lipid eﬃcacy have remained
obscure. several reports published early and also in recent years suggested multiple potential mechanisms that
would contribute to the lipid modulating eﬀects, including the reduction of hepatic uptake of hdl particle [2],
inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (dgat) [3],
and inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue [4].
biochemical studies of niacin eﬀects in rat membranes
suggested the presence of a  xxxg89xxx

in rat membranes of adipose tissue and spleen [5]. the
receptor was isolated independently by several groups
with diﬀerent nomenclatures [6–8]. wise et al. [6] initially reported that  xxxg1026xxx  binds to niacin at relatively
high aﬃnity (ki  95.8 nm) and appears to mediate gi
signaling. its close homolog,  xxxg1027xxx  which is 96% identical to  xxxg1026xxx  and with a 24 amino acid extension at
its carboxyl terminus, is a low aﬃnity receptor to niacin
(ki  1 mm) [6]. tunaru et al. [8], however, described
 xxxg1027xxx  as the niacin receptor (ki  55.6 nm) and
puma-g as the mouse ortholog of  xxxg1027xxx . soga et al.
[7] had similar ﬁndings as wise et al., however, they
named the receptor as hm74b. the physiological role
of the receptor has not been clearly deﬁned and awaits
further investigation. to be consistent with the original
report by wise et al., we have chosen to use  xxxg1026xxx  as
the name for the receptor in this report. here, we present
our data to show that niacin eﬀectively mediates inhibition of lipolysis in diﬀerentiated 3t3l1 cells expressing

the human receptor  xxxg1026xxx , but not its homolog,
 xxxg1027xxx . our results suggest  xxxg1026xxx  could play a significant role in mediating adipocyte lipolysis under physiological conditions in humans.

methods
cloning of  xxxg1026xxx ,  xxxg1027xxx , puma-g, and rat niacin receptor.
human  xxxg1026xxx ,  xxxg1027xxx , and puma-g were cloned with a pair of
primers amplifying the gene from its genomic or cdna sequence
(forward primer 5 0 -ggaagaattcttgctggagcattcactag
gcga gg-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -aattctcgagtgcggtca
caccttgcaaccagtc-3 0 ) and subsequent subcloning to pgemt
vector (promega). rat niacin receptor was isolated based on a
degenerative pcr cloning strategy. sequences were conﬁrmed and
subclones in expression vectors (pcdna3.1, invitrogen, carlsbad, ca)
or retroviruses expressing the receptors under the control of cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter were used to generate stable clones in
hek293 cells or 3t3l1 cells for further studies.
expression of  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx . an rpa probe was designed to
detect both receptors (with the primer sets 5 0 -gga aga att ctt
gct gga gca ttc cac tag  xxxg873xxx  agg, 3 0 -aat tct cga
 xxxg889xxx  cgg tca cac ctt gca acc agt c).
the respective length of the protected fragments when using this
probe is 350 base pairs for  xxxg1026xxx  and 225 base pairs for  xxxg1027xxx .
cellular localization of  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx . to construct aminoterminal green ﬂuorescent fusion proteins of  xxxg1026xxx  or  xxxg1027xxx ,
pegfp-c2 (for  xxxg1026xxx ) or pegfp-c1 (for  xxxg1027xxx ) vector (clontech)
was digested with sacii and smai and the linear vector was then gel
puriﬁed. a sacii, hincii fragment containing  xxxg1026xxx  or  xxxg1027xxx  was
then ligated to pegfp-c2 and sequenced. cho-k1 cells were seeded
to 4-well cover slides (nunc lab-tek ii) and incubated overnight in 3/
1 (dme/f12) + 10% fbs. the cells were approximately 75% conﬂuent at the time of transfection. 1.0 lg of dna was combined with
lipofectamine 2000 (10 ll) in optimem (invitrogen) and incubated at
room temperature for 20 min before the reaction mix was added to the
cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 °c in a co2 incubator. the media
were then aspirated and replaced with growth media (3/1 + 10% fbs).
after 24 h, 10 lg/ml  xxxd2284xxx  was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min to stain the nucleus. cells were then subjected to
confocal microscopic analysis.
niacin binding. the preparation of cell membranes and the binding
assay were performed according to the procedure by lorenzen et al.
[5], with small modiﬁcations. brieﬂy, pellets of cells were homogenized
and the membrane preparations were used immediately in the experiment. aliquots of membrane preparation were incubated with
[3h]niacin at the desired concentrations and the binding was assessed
with a ﬁlter-binding assay.
camp measurement by ampliﬁed luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (alpha screening). intracellular camp was measured
using the alphascreen camp assay kit from perkin-elmer life sciences according to the manufacturerõs directions. brieﬂy, anti-camp
biotin acceptor beads and streptavidin donor beads were brought into
proximity by speciﬁc biological interactions. on laser excitation at
680 nm, the ambient oxygen on acceptor beads was converted to singlet state by a photosensitizer in the donor beads. the singlet oxygen
reacted with a chemiluminescer in the proximity acceptor beads to
generate energy. the energy was then transferred to ﬂuorophores in
the same beads to emit light at 520–620 nm. presence of camp competed with acceptor and donor interaction and thus reduced the light
intensity emitted from donor beads, which enabled the amount of
camp in each sample to be calculated.
hek293 or nih-3t3l1 cells were stably transfected with receptors. cells were plated in t75 ﬂask 1 day before experiment to reach

fig. 1. (a) ectopic expression of human  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  in 293
cells. total rnas were prepared from hek293 cells expressing  xxxg1026xxx 
or  xxxg1027xxx  and subjected to the rnase protection assay. protected
fragments of diﬀerent sizes were indicated. a  xxxg798xxx  probe was used
as a control. (b) cellular localization of  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  in chinese
hamster ovary (cho-k1) cells. green ﬂuorescent fusion proteins were
made as described in methods. dna constructs were transiently
transfected into cho-k1 cells and the cellular localization of  xxxg1026xxx 
(a) and  xxxg1027xxx  (b) was examined by confocal microscope. the nucleus of
the cells was counterstained with  xxxd2284xxx . (c) niacin binding to
 xxxg1026xxx . membranes from hek293 cells expressing  xxxg1026xxx  were
prepared and a ﬁlter-binding assay was used to assess the binding aﬃnity
of niacin to the receptor as described in methods.

80–90% conﬂuent. 5000 cells, biotinylated-camp at 3 nm and designated compounds were incubated in low-volume 96-well plate for 1 h
at room temperature in the dark. then 0.4–0.5 lg of anti-camp
acceptor beads and streptavidin donor beads in lysis buﬀer were mixed
to the reaction and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
signal was then measured on the alpha quest instrument from
packard bioscience.
measurement of lipolysis in adipocytes. conﬂuent 3t3l1 preadipocytes were diﬀerentiated and the diﬀerentiated cells were serum
starved for 16 h before the supernatants were collected for glycerol
measurement using sigma glycerol reagent (cat # f6428) after niacin
treatment. each test was run in triplicate wells.

results and discussion
 xxxg1026xxx  has been reported as a high aﬃnity niacin
receptor and  xxxg1027xxx  as a low aﬃnity receptor [6].
puma-g [9] is a mouse ortholog and a rat receptor has
also been reported [7,6,8]. we cloned these receptors
and generated stable lines in hek293 cells. the expression of  xxxg1026xxx  and  xxxg1027xxx  was conﬁrmed with an
rnase protection assay (fig. 1a). to investigate the cellular distribution of the receptors, amino-terminal gfp
fusion proteins were made and the cellular localization
was examined with confocal microscopy. in cho-k1
cells, the gfp- xxxg1026xxx  displayed a pattern of membrane-associated distribution including plasma membrane (fig. 1b, a). gfp- xxxg1027xxx  appeared in every
compartment of the cells including plasma membrane
as well (fig. 1b, b). the binding of  xxxg1026xxx  to niacin
was corroborated, as shown in fig. 1c. the km value
for niacin binding to  xxxg1026xxx  is about 200 nm with
membranes prepared from the hek293 cell line. the
 xxxg1026xxx  from humans, mouse, and rat eﬀectively bound
to niacin while  xxxg1027xxx  did not demonstrate speciﬁc binding despite comparable levels of expression (table 1 and
fig. 1). measurement of intracellular camp levels in
hek293 cells (see methods) upon niacin treatment indicated that  xxxg1026xxx  mediated the reduction of intracellular camp levels with an ec50 value of about 50 nm
(fig. 2), suggesting a gi coupled intracellular signal
transduction event in mammalian cells.
we then used the retroviral constructs and generated
clones expressing human  xxxg1026xxx  or  xxxg1027xxx  in 3t3l1

731

preadipocytes. the expression of  xxxg1026xxx  or  xxxg1027xxx 
was corroborated with rpa (data not shown). after
the cells were induced to diﬀerentiate into adipocytes,
we were unable to detect endogenous puma-g expression in the 3t3l1 adipocytes by rpa (data not shown).
 xxxd1742xxx  addition to these cells resulted in concentration-dependent increase in intracellular camp levels as
was measured by alpha screening (fig. 3a). niacin
at 1 or 10 lm led to a signiﬁcant right shift of the curves,
suggesting the inhibition of intracellular camp production. if  xxxd1742xxx  was used at 1 lm ﬁxed concentration,
niacin concentration dependently reduced intracellular
camp levels (fig. 3b). we then measured the lipolysis
rate in these cells upon niacin addition. niacin had virtually no eﬀect in either native 3t3l1 cells or cells
expressing  xxxg1027xxx . however, in cells expressing
 xxxg1026xxx , concentration-dependent inhibition of lipolysis
was observed with close to 100% inhibition of lipolysis
(fig. 3c).
collectively, these results demonstrate that  xxxg1026xxx ,
but not  xxxg1027xxx , acts as a  xxxg89xxx  that

fig. 2.  xxxg1026xxx  mediates gi signaling in hek293 cells. cells were
treated with  xxxd1742xxx  and/or niacin for 1 h at room temperature and
intracellular camp levels in hek293 cells expressing  xxxg1026xxx  were
measured by alpha screening as described in methods. the alpha
screening light units are inversely correlated with intracellular camp
levels.

fig. 3. (a) niacin inhibits  xxxd1742xxx -induced intracellular camp levels through  xxxg1026xxx  in 3t3 adipocytes. 3t3l1 preadipocytes expressing
receptors were diﬀerentiated and intracellular camp in 3t3l1 adipocytes was measured similarly as in hek293 cells. (b) niacin mediates inhibition
of lipolysis in 3t3 adipocytes through  xxxg1026xxx . cells were diﬀerentiated as described in (a) and niacin was used to treat the cells for 1 h before
lipolysis was measured as described in methods. similar experiments were repeated for more than three times.

mediates niacin-induced reduction of intracellular
camp levels and inhibition of lipolysis. although the
molecular basis of niacin eﬀect on dyslipidemia remains
to be further explored, our study provides evidence to
suggest that  xxxg1026xxx  is likely a functional receptor that
mediates eﬀects of niacin on lipolysis and plasma-free
 xxxd2154xxx  in humans.
