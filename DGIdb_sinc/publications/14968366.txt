abstract  xxxd105xxx , a  xxxg395xxx /igg1 fusion protein, interferes with the activation and proliferation of t cells by
binding to the  xxxg377xxx  receptor on their surfaces. the clinical
efficacy of this drug has been demonstrated in chronic
plaque psoriasis. we performed a single-center, open-label
study to investigate the immunohistochemical effects in
psoriatic lesional skin. a group of 11 patients with plaque
psoriasis all received 12 weekly doses of 7.5 mg  xxxd105xxx 
intravenously. skin biopsies were obtained at baseline and
on days 8, 43 and 92, and were evaluated by digital image
analysis after immunohistochemical staining. after completion of treatment, 8 out of the 11 patients experienced a
reduction in pasi of 50% or more compared to baseline.
immunohistochemical analysis displayed a gradual decrease
in the number of cutaneous t cells during therapy, with a
significant reduction in epidermal cd8+ cells and dermal
cd4+ cells on day 92. patients with a reduction in pasi of
50% or more after therapy had a clearance of effector/
memory t cells from the epidermis, in contrast to patients
with a reduction in pasi of less than 50%. these findings
support the hypothesis that effector/memory t cells play a
prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and that
 xxxd105xxx  is capable of reducing these cells in lesional psoriatic skin.

introduction
psoriasis is a common dermatological inflammatory disorder affecting about 2% of the caucasian population. in the
last two decades the cell infiltrate of psoriatic skin lesions
has been investigated extensively (bjerke 1982; bjerke et
al. 1978; bos et al. 1983; schlaak et al. 1994). lesions are
characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation with abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, dermal vascular proliferation, and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the
epidermis and papillary dermis. the inflammatory infiltrate is primarily composed of cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes, expressing cd45ro on the surface, indicating their
effector/memory status (bos et al. 1989; morganroth et al.
1991). a substantial proportion of the infiltrating t cells
also express markers such as the  xxxg1174xxx   xxxg1175xxx 
(cd25) and hla-dr, indicating respectively early and
mid-to-late activation (bos et al. 1983; baker et al. 1984;
gottlieb et al. 1986; ferenczi et al. 2000). the beneficial
effects of specific t-cell targeted therapies such as  xxxd1781xxx  and dab389il-2 toxin, support the key role
for t lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (baker
et al. 1987; gottlieb et al. 1992; gottlieb et al. 1995).
since the current therapeutic arsenal is not very specific, new immunomodulating drugs have been produced
to treat patients with psoriasis. one of these new drugs is
 xxxd105xxx , a recombinant human  xxxg395xxx /igg1 fusion protein designed to inhibit the interaction between  xxxg377xxx  and
its ligand, leukocyte-function-associated antigen type 3
( xxxg395xxx ).  xxxg395xxx  is expressed on many cell types, including antigen-presenting cells.  xxxg377xxx  is weakly expressed on
natural killer cells and on naive (cd45ro–) t cells, but
is strongly upregulated on effector/memory (cd45ro+)
t cells upon activation (sanders et al. 1988; wallace and
beverley 1990). the  xxxg395xxx / xxxg377xxx  interaction provides a
costimulatory signal during the activation of t cells both
by directly signaling t cells, and by enhancing the adhe-

466

sive interaction of t cells and antigen-presenting cells
(dustin et al. 1987; springer et al. 1987; june et al. 1990;
danielian et al. 1991). the  xxxg395xxx  part of  xxxd105xxx  binds
to the  xxxg377xxx  receptor on t cells and interferes with t-cell
activation and proliferation (miller et al. 1993; majeau et
al. 1994). a recent study has also indicated an important
role for the igg domain of  xxxd105xxx , which interacts with
fcgammar type iii+ cells (e.g. natural killer cells and macrophages) to induce selective apoptosis of sensitive  xxxg377xxx +
cells (da silva et al. 2002). since  xxxg377xxx  is upregulated on
effector/memory (cd45ro+) t cells,  xxxd105xxx  is thought
to induce a selective reduction in these cells. this mechanism has recently been confirmed in in vitro studies
(cooper et al. 2003).
clinical data on the efficacy of  xxxd105xxx  therapy have
been collected in phase ii and iii multicenter trials. in a
recently reported placebo-controlled clinical trial,  xxxd105xxx 
was administered to patients with chronic plaque psoriasis
once a week for 12 consecutive weeks.  xxxd105xxx  proved
to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment, and clinical improvement was sustained after the 12-week treatment period. a selective reduction was observed in the
cd45ro+ t cell subpopulation in the peripheral blood
during  xxxd105xxx  therapy (ellis and krueger 2001). still,
only fragmentary information is available on the effects of
 xxxd105xxx  therapy on the inflammatory infiltrate in lesional
skin of patients with psoriasis. kobayashi et al. have reported that clinical improvement of psoriasis resulting
from  xxxd105xxx  treatment correlates with a reduction in
epidermal  xxxg1141xxx -producing t cells (kobayashi et al. 2001).
krueger et al. have reported a reversal of k16 expression
in lesional epidermis in 8 of 13 patients with plaque psoriasis treated with  xxxd105xxx  for 12 weeks (krueger et al.
2002). this response was accompanied by a reduction in
epidermal hyperplasia and a reduction in mean t cell
counts, predominantly epidermal cd8+ and cd103+ (epithelial homing) t cells. these results indicate a therapeutic
selectivity of  xxxd105xxx  on the major t cell subsets found
in the epidermis.
by investigating the changes in immunological cells
and molecules in the dermal and epidermal compartment
accompanying  xxxd105xxx -induced resolution of psoriatic
lesions, we aimed to elucidate the relative contribution of
different cellular elements in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. in the present study we focused on the changes in different t-lymphocyte subsets, activation markers and adhesion molecules in lesional skin of patients with plaque
psoriasis treated with  xxxd105xxx . we found a reduction in
the number of epidermal effector/memory t cells, which
correlated with clinical improvement. reductions were
present in both cd4+ and cd8+ epidermal t cells. we also
observed a reduction in the presence of activation markers
on t cells and a decreased expression of the adhesion molecule icam-1 after 12 weeks of  xxxd105xxx  treatment, indicating a downregulation of inflammation.

materials and methods
study design and patients
this open-label, fixed-dose, single-center study was conducted
in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, diagnosed at least
12 months prior to dosing. participants had at least two representative psoriatic plaques. patients with erythrodermic, guttate or generalized pustular psoriasis, or with a serious local or systemic infection within 3 months prior to dosing were excluded. prior to the
first dose, there was a washout phase of 4 weeks for systemic
retinoids, systemic fumarates, systemic steroids, methotrexate,  xxxd1781xxx , azathioprine,  xxxd3352xxx , investigational drugs,
phototherapy (including artificial tanning beds) and high potency
topical corticosteroids. in addition, there was a washout period of
2 weeks for moderate potency topical corticosteroids, vitamin d
analogues or topical retinoids, keratolytics and coal tar (other than
for scalp, palms, groin and/or soles of the feet). all patients were
naive to  xxxd105xxx . patients who met the entry criteria received
7.5 mg  xxxd105xxx  by i.v. bolus once a week for a total of 12 consecutive weeks and subsequently entered a follow-up period for
12 weeks. the protocol was reviewed and approved by the medical
ethical committee and all patients gave their written informed consent before enrollment. the study was conducted according to the
principles of the declaration of helsinki.
clinical efficacy assessments
the severity of psoriasis was assessed by the psoriasis area and
severity index (pasi) and total body area (tba) at baseline, on
days 15, 29, 43, 57 and 78 during the treatment period, and on days
92 (i.e. 2 weeks after the last dose), 106, 134 and 162 during the
follow-up period.
biopsies
at baseline and on days 8, 43 and 92, 4-mm punch biopsies were
taken from the inside border of a target psoriatic plaque under local lidocaine/adrenaline anesthesia. all biopsies of each individual
patient were taken from the same target lesion, separated by at least
1–2 cm. after being coded randomly, the biopsies were immediately embedded in tissuetek oct compound (sakura finetek europe, zoeterwoude, the netherlands), snap-frozen by immersion in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°c until processing. cryostat sections were cut at 5 µm, mounted on glass slides (star frost adhesive slides; knittelgläser, braunschweig, germany), air-dried at
room temperature, wrapped in aluminum foil, and stored at –80°c
until staining. all sections were processed in a single staining session for each primary antibody.
single-staining procedures
after fixation in 100% acetone for 10 min at 4°c, and blocking of
endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.1% sodium azide and 0.3%
 xxxd2298xxx  in tris-buffered saline (tbs) for 20 min, the sections were incubated for 15 min in 10% normal goat serum in tbs.
next, the sections were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody
in 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa; sigma-chemical, st. louis,
mo.) in tbs. the following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies were used: fitc-conjugated  xxxd2676xxx  (clone sk 7; becton
dickinson, san jose, calif.), anti-cd4 ( xxxg1266xxx ; becton dickinson),
anti-cd8 (sk1; becton dickinson), anti-cd45ro (opd4; dako,
glostrup denmark), anti-cd45ra (4kb5; dako), anti-icam-1
(bbig-l1; r&d systems, minneapolis, minn.), anti- xxxg2048xxx 
(68–5h11; becton dickinson), and anti- xxxg2406xxx  (51-10c9; becton
dickinson). after rinsing with tbs, sections were further incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (dako) or,

467
in the case of cd3 staining, with rabbit-anti-fitc (dako) in 10%
normal human serum (nhs) in tbs for 30 min. following a wash
step with tbs, sections were incubated with streptavidin conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase (hrp; dako) or, in the case of cd3
staining, with hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (dako), in
1% bsa in tbs for 30 min. after a final rinse with tbs, the hrp
activity was visualized as an orange-red color by incubation with
3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (aec; sigma-aldrich). sections were
counterstained with mayer’s hematoxylin and mounted in glycerin-gelatin (dako).
double-staining procedures
in the double-staining experiments we used fitc-conjugated anticd3 (becton dickinson) together with either anti-hla-dr (l243;
becton dickinson) or anti-cd25 (act-1; dako) antibodies. after
inhibition of the endogenous peroxidase activity and blocking nonspecific binding sites with 10% normal goat serum in tbs, the sections were incubated with the first primary antibody (anti-hla-dr
or anti-cd25) for 1 h at room temperature.
for the cd3/hla-dr staining, the sections were rinsed with
tbs, and incubated with goat anti-mouse peroxidase-labeled antibody (dako) in 10% nhs in tbs 30 min. after rinsing with tbs
again, a second blocking for nonspecific binding sites was performed with 10% normal mouse serum in tbs. next, sections were
incubated with fitc-conjugated  xxxd2676xxx  in 1% bsa in tbs for
1 h, then washed with tbs and incubated with rabbit anti-fitc in
10% nhs in tbs for 30 min. subsequently they were incubated
with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody (dako).
after a final rinse with tbs, the phosphatase activity was visualized using fast blue salt (sigma), resulting in a blue color. to visualize the peroxidase activity, aec was used to give a red color.
for the cd3/cd25 staining, the sections were rinsed with tbs,
and successively incubated with goat anti-mouse biotin-labeled antibody (dako) in 10% nhs in tbs for 30 min, hrp-conjugated
streptavidin (dako) in 1% bsa in tbs for 30 min, 10% normal
mouse serum in tbs to block nonspecific binding sites, fitc-conjugated  xxxd2676xxx  in 1% bsa in tbs for 1 h, rabbit anti-fitc in
10% nhs in tbs for 30 min, and finally goat anti-rabbit alkaline
phosphatase-labeled antibody (dako). after a final rinse with tbs,
the phosphatase and peroxidase activity were visualized as above.

peripheral blood measurements
the number of cd45ro+ t lymphocytes in peripheral blood was
quantified by flow cytometric analyses at each study visit.
statistical analysis
spss 10.1.4 for windows (spss, chicago, ill.) was used for statistical analysis. the results are expressed as medians and range.
to determine the significance of differences between the baseline
and subsequent values the wilcoxon-signed rank’s test was used.
all statistical tests were two-sided; p values less than 0.05 were
considered to be significant. the spearman’s rank correlation test
was used to determine correlations between different variables.

results
 xxxd105xxx  treatment reduces clinical signs
of disease activity during the treatment period
nine males and two females were included in the study.
their median age was 45 years (range 35–70 years ), their
median pasi at baseline was 11.7 (range 1.6–39.2) and
their median tba was 15% (range 1–55%). all patients
had a longstanding history of psoriasis; the median duration
was 20 years (range 10–40 years). ten out of the 11 patients
had a history of systemic treatment, including methotrexate (ten patients), uvb (three patients) and cyclosporine
a (one patient). all patients finished the 12-week treatment
without the need for concomitant medication and without
major side effects. during the subsequent 12-week followup period, after the day-92 biopsy, four patients started
topical therapy and three patients started systemic therapy
because of worsening of psoriatic lesions or arthritis.
after 4 weeks of treatment a decrease in median pasi
was noticeable that was sustained throughout the treatment period (fig. 1). on day 92, 2 weeks after the last dose,

digital image analysis
all single-stained sections were randomly coded and analyzed by
digital image analysis by a blinded observer. from each section a
representative region of 1.45×1.45 mm, including epidermis and
dermis, was captured and digitized, and divided in 20 separate highpower fields. subsequently, sections were examined using a specialized algorithm written in the program language quips operating
a qwin-based (qwin pro v2.4, leica, cambridge, uk) computerassisted color video image analysis system (kraan et al. 2000).
cellular-stained sections were separately counted for epidermal
and dermal region. epidermal counts were expressed as positive
cells per millimeter; dermal counts were expressed as positive cells
per millimeter squared. the presence of adhesion molecules was expressed as integrated optical density (iod) per millimeter squared.
each biopsy was analyzed in triplicate to minimize random variation in infiltration.
manual quantification
double-stained sections were manually counted by two independent blinded observers. using a 0.5×0.5 mm ocular grid and at
×200 magnification, single red, single blue, and double-positive cells
were counted in the entire section. the epidermal and dermal regions were separately counted. the results are expressed as the number of double-positive cells per millimeter (epidermis) or per millimeter squared (dermis).

median tba was reduced from 15% (range 1–55%) at
baseline to 10% (range 1–70%) on day 92.
 xxxd105xxx  treatment reduces psoriasis lesional
t-cell numbers
both epidermal and dermal t-cell numbers decreased during  xxxd105xxx  treatment (table 1). the median epidermal
t-cell number was decreased by 31% on day 92, and the

median dermal t cell number was decreased by 35% on
day 92 (p≤0.05). there was a gradual reduction in epidermal thickness throughout the treatment period from 45 µm
(range 29–70 µm) at baseline to 36 µm (26–64 µm) on day 92.
 xxxd105xxx  treatment decreases the number
of both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in psoriatic lesional skin
in the epidermis, the gradual reduction in the number of
cd8+ cells reached statistical significance on day 92
(table 1). there was also a decrease in the number of epidermal cd4+ cells during therapy, but this reduction did
not reach statistical significance. in the dermis, there was a
significant decrease in the number of cd4+ cells on day 92.
the decrease in the number of dermal cd8+ cells did not

469

reach statistical significance. changes per patient in the
number of cd4+ and cd8+ cells are shown in fig. 2. reductions in the number of both epidermal cd4+ cells and
epidermal cd8+ cells correlated with the reduction in epidermal thickness (rho=0.64, p=0.035; rho=0.68, p=0.022,
respectively). the median epidermal cd4+/cd8+ ratio increased from 1.8 (range 0.1–73) at baseline to 2.9 (range
0.3–79) on day 92 (p<0.02). the median dermal cd4+/
cd8+ ratio (baseline ratio 5.8, range 2.9–273) did not
change significantly during therapy.

although not statistically significant, we did observe a
more profound reduction in the number of epidermal and
dermal cd4+ and cd8+ cells in the high-response group
(pasi reduction on day 92 50% or more from baseline)
compared to the low-response group (pasi reduction less
than 50%).
 xxxd105xxx -induced reduction in the number

a substantial proportion of the lesional t cells were effector/memory (cd45ro+) t cells. the number of naive
t cells present in the lesions was insignificant, at baseline
the median number of cd45ra+ cells in the epidermis
was 0 (range 0–3) and the median number of dermal
cd45ra+ cells was 1 (range 0–7). as early as day 8, a
decrease of 67% could be noticed in the median number
of cd45ro+ cells in the epidermis, which was sustained
throughout the treatment period (fig. 3). the number of
dermal cd45ro+ cells was initially increased on day 8,
but had decreased by 35% on day 43 and by 73% on
day 92. representative immunohistochemical stainings

there was a significant difference in response of memory/effector t cells between patients with a high clinical
response at day 92 (pasi reduction 50% or more, n=3) and
patients with a low or absent clinical response (pasi reduction less than 50%, n=8). in high-responding patients
a clearing of epidermal memory/effector t cells had occurred by day 92. in patients with a lower or absent clinical response, the median memory/effector t cell number
in the epidermis had increased (p≤0.05). in addition, the
number of dermal cd45ro+ cells on day 92 showed a significantly greater decrease in the high-responding patients
than in the low-responding patients (90% reduction vs 41%
reduction, p≤0.02). these different responses of the two
groups of patients were also paralleled by a greater reduction in cd45ro+ t cells in the peripheral blood in hightable 2 results of immunohistochemical double-staining

after the start of  xxxd105xxx  treatment, there was a gradual
reduction in the number of epidermal cd25+ t cells
(table 2). on day 92, there was a 42% decrease compared
to baseline (p<0.05). a change in the number of dermal
cd25+ t cells was not seen until day 92, when there was a
45% decrease from baseline (p<0.05). the median number
of epidermal hla-dr+ t cells at baseline was 23 (3–56),
decreasing by 48% on day 8 and by 61% on day 92
(p<0.02). the number of dermal hla-dr+ also decreased
significantly after  xxxd105xxx  therapy (table 2). although
not statistically significant, the reduction in the number of
activated t cells in the epidermis and dermis was more
profound in high-responding patients than it was in lowresponding patients.
we also looked at the percentage of cd25+ t cells in
relation the total number of t cells. at baseline, 59% of
the number of epidermal t cells were cd25+ and 57% of
the t cells were hla-dr+. after 12 weeks of treatment,
these percentages had not changed significantly, due to a
decrease in both non-activated t cells and activated t cells.

tistically significant, presumably due to the small number
of patients. there was a gradual reduction in expression
of  xxxg2048xxx  from the start of therapy until day 43. however, on day 92 the level of expression was equal to the
baseline level. apparently, the expression of  xxxg2048xxx 
is not directly correlated with the number of t cells in lesional skin. the expression of  xxxg2406xxx  (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) did not change significantly during
therapy.

discussion
the data presented here suggest that the t-cell population
in lesional psoriatic skin is affected by intravenously administered  xxxd105xxx  therapy. we observed a reduction in
the number of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell subsets in the epidermis as early as 8 days after the first dose of  xxxd105xxx ,
whereas reductions in both t-cell subsets in the dermis were
not observed until day 43. not all results were statistically
significant, which might be explained by the limited number of patients participating in the study and the wide interpatient variability. also, because of the open-label character of the study we were not able to compare the immunohistochemical data with results from placebo-treated
patients. however, the consistent reductions in the immunological markers show a trend towards downregulation of
inflammation that cannot be explained by expectation bias
or regression to the mean, and are likely to be a result of
 xxxd105xxx  therapy. the interpatient variability was bypassed
by using patients as their own control.
although the role of cd4+ t cells and cd8+ t cells in
psoriasis has been investigated in numerous studies, the
individual contribution of both subsets to the pathogenesis
and clearance of psoriatic lesions has not yet been fully
elucidated. there have been several reports describing a
preponderance of cytotoxic cd8+ t cells in lesional epidermis (bos et al. 1983; hammar et al. 1984; bos et al.
1989; austin et al. 1998), but this observation could not
be confirmed in our study, as cd4+ cells were predominant over cd8+ cells in both epidermis and dermis. a previous study has demonstrated that  xxxd105xxx  targets both
cd4+ and cd8+ effector/memory t cells in peripheral
blood (ellis and krueger 2001). we demonstrated that
 xxxd105xxx  targets both subsets in lesional skin as well, but
nevertheless we found an increase in the cd4+/cd8+ ratio
in the epidermis during therapy. this agrees with reports
that a reduction in disease severity is correlated with depletion of epidermal cd8+ t cells (baker et al. 1987; vallat et al. 1994; krueger et al. 1995).
 xxxd105xxx  is thought to affect predominantly the
cd45ro+ (effector/memory) t-cell population, because
these cells have a high expression of  xxxg377xxx  on their surfaces. cooper et al. have shown that  xxxd105xxx  selectively
promotes nk cell-mediated deletion of cd45r0+ human
t cells in vitro (cooper et al. 2003). in addition, ellis and
krueger have shown that a reduction in memory t cells in
peripheral blood induced by  xxxd105xxx  treatment is correlated with clinical improvement (ellis and krueger 2001).

our own study not only confirmed these observations but,
perhaps more importantly, also suggested that a correlation exists between a reduction in effector/memory t cells
in lesional psoriatic epidermis and improvement in clinical symptoms. even after one dose of  xxxd105xxx  a decrease
in epidermal effector/memory t cells could be observed,
which preceded clinical improvement. these findings support the concept that effector/memory t cells have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and demonstrate
that  xxxd105xxx  is capable of reducing effector/memory t cells
in lesional skin. in addition, an association between a reduction in the effector t cell population in peripheral blood
and synovial tissue and improvement of clinical signs of
psoriatic arthritis during  xxxd105xxx  therapy has been reported recently (kraan et al. 2002). however, our observations should be confirmed in a larger group of high-responding patients before definite conclusions can be drawn.
the two activation-associated molecules investigated
in this study are known to be expressed during early activation (cd25) and late activation (hla-dr) of t cells
(ferenczi et al. 2000). the presence of both molecules at
baseline on most epidermal and dermal t cells supports
the hypothesis of persistent t-cell activation in skin lesions of psoriasis patients. the reduction in both markers
during  xxxd105xxx  therapy indicates a reduction in t-cell activation in both epidermis and dermis. however, besides
reducing activated t cells,  xxxd105xxx  treatment also reduced
the number of non-activated (hla-dr–/cd25–) t cells,
suggesting that the effect of this drug on t cells is not
completely related to the state of activation of t cells. this
could be either a direct result of  xxxd105xxx , or due to the
overall downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and costimulatory molecules reducing
the total number of t cells migrating to the inflamed area.
it has been reported that  xxxd105xxx  has a long-lasting effect, with patients treated with  xxxd105xxx  having a median
time to relapse (i.e. patients no longer clear or almost clear)
of 306 days (ellis and krueger 2001). this long-lasting
remission cannot be explained just by a reduced capacity
for t cells to be activated. we think it would be more likely
that the long-lasting effect of  xxxd105xxx  is due to the selective reduction in memory/effector t cells in lesional skin,
supposedly by an apoptotic mechanism (da silva 2002).
also, the reduced expression of icam-1 observed in this
study, although not statistically significant, might inhibit
the migration of t cells into the inflamed area and the subsequent activation. icam-1 is expressed on a variety of
cytokine-stimulated cells, including endothelial cells, antigen-presenting cells and keratinocytes, and binds to its ligand lfa-1 on t cells (wawryk et al. 1989). icam-1 facilitates the trans-endothelial migration of t cells and the
adhesion of t cells to keratinocytes, and is thought to provide costimulatory signals necessary for t-cell activation.
expression of icam-1 is related to progression of local
immune responses (dustin and springer 1991; gottlieb et
al. 2002). possibly the downregulation of icam-1 after
 xxxd105xxx  therapy is caused by a decreased release of cytokines such as tnf-alpha,  xxxg1141xxx  and il-1 that induce icam
expression (griffiths et al. 1989; uyemura et al. 1993).

we observed substantial interindividual variations in the
clinical and immunohistochemical response to  xxxd105xxx ,
which could not be explained by disease severity or disease duration. at the present time it is not clear why some
patients do not respond well to  xxxd105xxx  therapy. it is already known that different subgroups exist among psoriasis patients. henseler and christophers have reported a
more severe disease course and a stronger influence of genetic factors in patients with early-onset psoriasis compared to late-onset psoriasis (henseler and christophers
2001). recently these observations have been confirmed
by reich et al, who reported that promoter polymorphisms
of the genes encoding tnf- alpha and  xxxg1170xxx  are associated
with different subtypes of psoriasis, characterized by early
and late disease onset, respectively (reich et al. 2002).
concerning the possible involvement of polymorphisms,
the variability in response to  xxxd105xxx  might be due to
heterogeneity in  xxxg377xxx  or fcgammar type iii among patients.
perhaps future clinical trials, supported by further immunohistochemical analysis, could identify patient subpopulations that are likely to respond to  xxxd105xxx  therapy.
in conclusion, the results presented here indicate that
 xxxd105xxx  reduces signs of inflammation in lesional psoriatic skin. by the different observations made in this study,
we can assume that multiple mechanisms of action of  xxxd105xxx  are likely. first, clinical improvement in high-responding patients induced by  xxxd105xxx  treatment was associated with a clearance of effector/memory t cells from
lesional psoriatic epidermis, possibly caused by an apoptotic mechanism. second, the decrease in the expression
of activation markers might indicate a diminution of t-cell
activation in lesional skin, with resulting decreases in proinflammatory cytokines.
