abstract
hepatic stellate cells (hsc) play an essential role in fibrogenesis. many stimuli cause hsc to activate, lose their  xxxd3105xxx  and produce
collagen. it is unclear whether  xxxd3105xxx  loss causes activation, potentiates it or is simply an event in the cascade of activation changes.
we determine if exogenous retinoids prevent the activation of freshly isolated rat hsc activated by plating on plastic. we also determine if
retinoids: (1) reverse hsc activation; (2) maintain/restore hsc intracellular retinoid levels; (3) maintain expression of hsc nuclear receptors
for  xxxd3417xxx  (rar) in hsc that are becoming activated or are chronically activated.
markers of activation in freshly isolated hsc were decreased by either retinol or  xxxd3417xxx  without increases in hsc retinoid concentration. mrna levels for rar-␣, rar-␤ and rar-␥, the nuclear receptors for  xxxd3417xxx , decreased during activation of freshly isolated
hsc even with retinoid supplementation. rar-␣, rar-␤ and rar-␥ mrna and rar-␤ protein was undetectable in chronically activated
hsc and remained absent after  xxxd3417xxx  supplementation. activation markers in chronically activated hsc were only slightly decreased
after retinoid exposure.
we conclude that exposure of hsc to extracellular retinoids diminishes some markers of activation but does not prevent hsc activation.

1. introduction
hepatic stellate cells (hsc) play an essential role in the
fibrogenesis seen following a variety of hepatic insults. current dogma is that hsc (formerly known as ito cells, vitamin
a storing cells or lipocytes) are responsible for the majority
of production of the extracellular matrix seen in hepatic fibrosis. in their native state in healthy liver, hsc are in a dormant
or quiescent state, characterized by storage of large amounts
of  xxxd3105xxx , little or no proliferation and a round cell morphology. under a multitude of stimuli, hsc become activated
and lose their  xxxd3105xxx , change morphology to a fibroblas∗ corresponding author. present address: division of gastroenterology

tic shape and begin to produce collagen (mainly types i and
iv). one the most intriguing stimuli that cause this activation is the exposure of hsc to particular components of the
extracellular matrix. for instance if hsc are isolated from
liver in a quiescent state and plated on glass or plastic, they
rapidly (over 2–5 days) lose their  xxxd3105xxx  and subsequently
become activated [1–3].
the loss of  xxxd3105xxx  during activation of hsc has been
noted for many years [4–7]. however, it is unclear whether
 xxxd3105xxx  loss causes activation, potentiates it or is simply an
event in the cascade of changes that occur during activation.
 xxxd3105xxx  signaling controls a variety of biochemical and
nuclear processes [5,8–11]. previous work has demonstrated
two families of nuclear receptors for  xxxd3417xxx  (the most
physiologically active derivative of  xxxd3105xxx ):  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors (rar’s) and retinoid x receptors (rxr’s). ohata
et al. [8] demonstrated that hsc from cholestatic rats had
suppressed expression of both rar-␤ and rxr-␣. it has

226

m.t. milliano, b.a. luxon / hepatology research 33 (2005) 225–233

also been shown that different forms of  xxxd3417xxx  affect
hsc differentially.  xxxd3417xxx  inhibited procollagens types i, iii and iv while 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  increased
procollagen mrna levels. these authors also showed that
effects of different forms of  xxxd3417xxx  were time dependent
with inhibition of hsc proliferation occurring maximally
after 120 h of exposure to 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx . finally all
trans- xxxd3417xxx  lowered mrna levels for a multitude of
ecm proteins.  xxxg1418xxx  ( xxxg1418xxx ) is downregulated by  xxxd3417xxx  although this effect is dependent on
which cell type is being investigated [12]. it is possible that
even a modest lack of ligand (e.g.,  xxxd3417xxx ) could result
in a significant down-regulation of hsc rar’s and interfere
with retinoid signal transduction, leading to cell proliferation
and transformation of hsc to an activated state.
in this paper, we determine if exogenous retinoids (either
in the form of retinol or  xxxd3417xxx ) would prevent or minimize the activation of freshly isolated rat hsc. we also
determine if media supplementation with retinoids would (1)
return chronically activated hsc to the quiescent state; (2)
maintain/restore hsc intracellular retinoid levels; (3) maintain expression of hsc rar’s in rat hsc that were becoming
activated or were chronically activated.
our results show that hsc exposed to exogenous retinoids
(supplied as 1 and 100 ␮m retinol or 1 ␮m  xxxd3417xxx ) did
not demonstrate toxicity based on desmin levels, cell morphology, trypan blue exclusion or fluorescent dye exclusion.
markers of activation in freshly isolated hsc were significantly decreased in hsc exposed to either retinol or retinoic
acid for 7 days but had a similar decrease in the intracellular retinoid concentration compared to unsupplemented
hsc. nuclear expression of the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors
decreased dramatically during activation of freshly isolated
hsc even with supplementation of retinoids. rar-␣, rar␤ and rar-␥ mrna and rar-␤ protein was undetectable
in chronically activated cells and remained absent even after
supplementation with  xxxd3417xxx . markers of activation
(␣-sma expression and cell proliferation) in chronically activated hsc were slightly but not significantly decreased after
exposure to retinoids for 7 days but did not decrease to levels
seen in freshly isolated quiescent hsc.

2. materials and methods

mouse antibody conjugated with biotin was purchased from
sigma. a monoclonal hamster antibody to rat ␣-sma was
purchased from pharmingen (san diego, ca). desmin levels were detected using monoclonal antibody to rat desmin
(sigma) [3]. secondary anti-hamster antibodies were from
sigma. primers used to measure rar-␣, rar-␤, rar-␥,
18s and  xxxg861xxx  mrna by real time reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) were purchased from
invitrogen (carlsbad, ca). all other reagents were of the
highest grade commercially available.
2.2. hepatic stellate cell isolation
hepatic stellate cells (hsc) were isolated from male
sprague–dawley rats by a density gradient centrifugation
technique [13,3]. all hsc were maintained in ham’s dmem
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing penicillin
(100 u/ml) and streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml).
2.3. experimental design
freshly isolated hsc were harvested and plated on 6 well
plastic culture dishes, 2 × 106 hsc/well, in ham’s dmem
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum with or without
retinoids (retinol 1 or 100 ␮m;  xxxd3417xxx  1 ␮m). retinoids
were solubilized in 100% ethanol before being added to hsc
media. chronically activated hsc were passed (10–20 passages) on uncoated plastic dishes in ham’s dmem with 10%
fetal calf serum and remained in an activated state [13]. these
passaged hsc were phenotypically similar to chronically
activated hsc that had not been passaged as has been shown
by other investigators [13,1,14,15]. on day 0, these chronically activated hsc were harvested and replated on 6 well
plastic culture dishes, 2 × 106 hsc/well, in ham’s dmem
with the retinoid doses as above.
morphology was assessed by phase contrast microscopy
and viability by trypan blue exclusion and fluorescent dye
exclusion (live/deadtm assay, molecular probes, eugene,
or). hsc samples for ␣-sma, desmin and total protein were
harvested with lysis buffer [16]. cell samples for retinoid
content were removed with trypsin into fresh ham’s dmem.
hsc were harvested at day 0, 3, 5, 7 and, in some cases,
day 10. control hsc, both freshly isolated and passaged,
were plated under identical conditions except they were not
exposed to retinoids but were exposed to etoh vehicle.

2.1. sources of materials
2.4. measurement of intracellular retinoid content
retinol, retinal,  xxxd3417xxx ,  xxxd3105xxx  and retinol
palmitate were obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo). ham’s
dmem was purchased from gibco (grand island, ny).
hplc solvents (acetonitrile, methanol and dichloromethane)
were purchased from sigma. 3 h-thymidine (specific activity 6.7 ci/mmole) was from new england nuclear (boston,
ma). mouse monoclonal antibody against the nuclear
 xxxg1932xxx  (rar-␤) was from affinity bioreagents, inc. (product number  xxxd3382xxx -811). secondary igg anti-

 xxxd3417xxx , retinol and  xxxd3105xxx  levels were
determined by reverse phase hplc using a c18 (5 ␮m)
column. as suggested by ramm [1] and blomhoff [17]
the mobile phase was acetonitrile:methanol:dichloromethane
(70:15:15, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. uv absorbance
was detected at 325 nm using a waters hplc model 501
(waters, milford, ma). after hsc were harvested, the cells
were denatured with an equal volume of  xxxd102xxx ,

fig. 1. (a) retinoid levels in freshly isolated hepatic stellate cells. hsc were isolated and plated on plastic and exposed to retinol (1 ␮m) or control conditions.
retinoid levels expressed as retinol equivalents were determined by hplc as described in text. there was a progressive drop in retinoid levels in hsc as
they became activated that was not influenced by retinol supplementation. error bars are s.e.m.’s from 8 to 10 measurements. * p < 0.05 compared to day 0
results. hplc analysis of retinoids: labeled peaks indicate the elution times of the indicated retinoids as confirmed by pure standards. the predominant peak
was  xxxd3105xxx  (2.53 min) with smaller amounts of retinol (1.1 min) and  xxxd3417xxx  (0.62 min). the additional peaks that eluted at 2.10 and 2.98 min
were not identified but other studies suggest that these may be other retinol esters such as stearate or  xxxd2777xxx . (b) retinoid levels in chronically activated hepatic

isolated hsc. exposure to retinol or  xxxd3417xxx  did not increase retinoid levels. error bars are s.e.m.’s from 9 to 10 measurements.

extracted into hexane and evaporated to residue. the residue
was suspended in the hplc mobile phase (volume 20 ␮l)
immediately prior to injection onto the column. the unknown
peaks from cell samples were identified using pure chromatographic standards of  xxxd3417xxx , retinal, retinol, retinol
palmitate and retinol stearate (see fig. 1a, inset). retinoid
levels (defined as retinol plus  xxxd3105xxx ) were converted to retinol equivalents [18,1].
2.5. measurement of cell proliferation
cell proliferation was determined by measuring 3 hthymidine incorporation [16]. hsc were labeled using 3 hthymidine (2 ␮ci/ml) for 24 h. hsc were then washed with
pbs and  xxxd102xxx  and allowed to dry. hsc were prepared for scintillation counting using 1 ml 0.33n hcl and
counted in scintisafe (fischer chemical, st. louis, mo)
on a taurus liquid scintillation counter. total cell protein
was determined by the method of bradford [19]. results are
expressed as dpm per micro gram of total cell protein.

2.6. measurement of  xxxg1932xxx  protein expression
at 0, 3, 5 and 7 days, hsc were trypsinized and prepared
for western blotting following the method of ali et al. [20].
nuclear protein was isolated using the protocol of schreiber
[21]. after loading 15 ␮g of nuclear protein, electrophoresis
was done on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. prestained molecular weight markers (sigma) were loaded in adjacent lanes.
blots were developed and chemiluminescence was detected
by ecl (amersham, arlington, il). the band corresponding
to a molecular size of 52 kda was quantified by densitometry
as rar-␤ protein.
2.7. measurement of  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx  mrna
at 0, 3, 5 and 7 days, hsc were trypsinized and total
mrna isolated by a commercially available kit (stat-60,
tel test, inc.). mrna for rar-␣, rar-␤ and rar-␥ was
determined using real time pcr (rt-pcr) with primers as
suggested previously [5,15]. northern blot analysis was also

228

m.t. milliano, b.a. luxon / hepatology research 33 (2005) 225–233

used to quantify mrna for rar-␤. northern blot analysis
was done after loading 15 ␮g of total rna per lane onto
1% denaturing agarose gel. bands for rar-␤ were visualized using a 919 bp probe (cdna probe was a gift from dr.
pierre chambon, paris, france) that had been biotinylated.
measurements of mrna made using rt-pcr for rar-␣,
rar-␤ and rar-␥ were normalized to mrna for 18s or
 xxxg861xxx  [5,8,11].
2.8. measurement of alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin
at 0, 3, 5 and 7 days, hsc were trypsinized and prepared
for western blotting. after loading 10 ␮g of cell protein, electrophoresis was done on 8% polyacrylamide gel. ␣-sma was
measured using a monoclonal hamster antibody to rat ␣-sma
[3]. desmin levels were detected using monoclonal antibody
to rat desmin [3]. chemiluminescence was detected by ecl.
2.9. statistical methods
results of multiple measurements (between 6 and 15
measurements) in a particular experimental condition are
expressed as means ± s.e.m. anova was used to determine
the significance of differences between experimental groups.
p-values <0.05 were taken to be statistically significant. the
specific number of replications of a particular experimental
condition is listed in each figure legend.

3. results
3.1. intracellular retinoid concentration
retinol,  xxxd3417xxx  and  xxxd3105xxx  levels were
determined by reverse phase hplc. the  xxxd3417xxx , retinol
and retinol esters peaks corresponding to the standards were
well defined (see fig. 1a, inset). the predominant peak of
hsc intracellular retinoid eluted identically with the palmitate ester (2.53 min). two small peaks that eluted at 2.10
and 2.98 min were not consistently identified in all samples. these corresponded to the retinol esters formed with
stearate and  xxxd2777xxx  [22]. the concentrations of retinol or
 xxxd3417xxx  in the bathing medium were unchanged from
their nominal value in treated culture dishes. no extracellular
retinoids could be detected in the media from unsupplemented (control) culture dishes. the total retinoid content
of hsc is expressed as retinol equivalents [17]. to this end,
the concentration of  xxxd3105xxx  was converted to retinol
equivalents and added to retinol results [1]. the total retinoid
content is expressed as nanograms per well.
in freshly isolated hsc, supplementation with 1 ␮m
retinol did not decrease the loss of  xxxd3105xxx  compared to
control hsc (80 ± 22 ng/well versus 75 ± 31 ng/well at day 7
and 15 ± 10 ng/well versus 19 ± 5 ng/well at day 10, p > 0.5,
control versus treated at each time point). nearly all (>95%)
of the retinol was esterified, most of it (>85%) conjugated to

palmitate. in contrast, chronically activated hsc had dramatically diminished retinol content compared to freshly isolated
cells. supplementation with either retinol or  xxxd3417xxx  did
not change the intracellular retinol content even after 7 days
of exposure (fig. 1b).
3.2. retinoid toxicity
hsc showed no toxicity to either retinol or  xxxd3417xxx 
at the concentrations used in these experiments as judged by
trypan dye exclusion, desmin production or fluorescent dye
exclusion (data not shown). this is consistent with previous
work demonstrating that retinoids were not toxic to hsc at
concentrations less than 100 ␮m [4,23].
3.3. effect of retinoid exposure on activation of freshly
isolated hsc
expression of ␣-sma was used as a marker of hsc
activation. freshly isolated hsc showed minimal, if any,
expression of ␣-sma. freshly isolated hsc plated on plastic
became activated in 5–7 days as detected by an increase in
␣-sma expression, increased proliferation, loss of intracellular  xxxd3105xxx  and change to a “fibroblast-like” morphology
[13,16]. this transformation was complete by 7 days in control hsc. the time course of activation has been previously
demonstrated [23]. freshly isolated hsc exposed to either
retinol (1 or 100 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) had decreased
expression of ␣-sma after 5 or 7 days of culture (p < 0.05
at days 5 and 7, fig. 2a). retinol (1 ␮m) and  xxxd3417xxx 
(1 ␮m) decreased freshly isolated hsc cell proliferation as
measured by 3 h-thymidine incorporation (fig. 3a).
3.4. effect of retinoids on chronically activated hsc
chronically activated hsc expressed abundant ␣-sma
protein as expected [1,3]. over 7 days in culture, no significant changes in morphology or ␣-sma expression occurred
in activated hsc exposed to control media. exposure to
retinol (either 1 or 100 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) did not
produce a statistically significant decrease in ␣-sma production although levels of ␣-sma tended to be slightly less
(fig. 2b). retinol (1 ␮m) and  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) decreased
cell proliferation only slightly as measured by 3 h-thymidine
incorporation (fig. 3b). the changes were not statistically
significant. this is consistent with previous results showing
that retinoids have a non-specific anti-proliferative effect on
a variety of cell lines [23,24].
3.5. hsc levels of mrna for nuclear  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors  xxxg1931xxx ,  xxxg1932xxx  and  xxxg1933xxx 
mrna for the three rar’s was measured by rt-pcr
and the results normalized for the mrna for  xxxg861xxx  or
18s.  xxxg861xxx  and 18s mrna levels did not change with
either activation or exposure to retinoids. freshly isolated

retinol (1 or 100 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m). ␣-sma expression was determined at days 0, 3, 5 and 7 by western blotting. hsc exposed to control media
had significantly higher ␣-sma at day 7 compared to day 0. exposure to either retinol or  xxxd3417xxx  caused significantly less ␣-sma expression by day 7.
error bars are s.e.m.’s from 10 to 12 measurements; ** p < 0.05 compared to day 0 results and * p < 0.05 compared to control at day 7. (b) effect of retinoids
on ␣-smooth muscle actin levels in chronically activated hepatic stellate cells. chronically activated hsc were replated at day 0 and exposed to either control
media, retinol (1 or 100 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m). ␣-sma was determined by western blotting at days 0, 3, 5 and 7. exposure to  xxxd3417xxx  caused a
modest decrease in ␣-sma expression at day 7 compared to hsc exposed to control media. this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). error
bars are s.e.m.’s from six to seven measurements.

hsc contained mrna for each of the three rar’s but by day
3, the mrna levels for all three were dramatically diminished
(fig. 4). the loss of mrna for the three rar’s continued
and, by day 7, mrna levels were less than 5% of day 0
values. supplementation with  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) did not
prevent the loss of mrna for rar’s.
3.6. hsc expression of nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptor
 xxxg1932xxx 
western analysis of nuclear protein extracted from freshly
isolated hsc contained significant amounts of the beta
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar-␤) (fig. 5a). hsc cultured on
plastic had essentially no detectable rar-␤ by day 7. exposure of hsc to retinol (1 or 100 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m)
for 7 days did not reverse the loss of rar-␤ receptor expression. expression of  xxxg861xxx  was not significantly different
between retinol or  xxxd3417xxx  treated cells and control hsc
at any time point.
chronically activated hsc had no detectable rar-␤ protein detectable by western analysis (data not shown) nor
detectable mrna for rar-␣ rar-␤ or rar-␥ (fig. 5b,
inset). treatment of chronically activated hsc with retinoic

acid (1 ␮m) for 7 days did not reverse the loss of rar mrna
nor restore rar-␤ protein expression (data not shown).

4. discussion
the observation that hepatic stellate cells rapidly lose their
retinol stores as they become activated has raised the issue
of whether the decrease in retinoid content initiates hsc
activation, whether it is a result of activation and whether
supplementation of hsc with various retinoids might potentially suppress hsc activation. although this postulate has
been studied for nearly a decade, the answer is not completely
known [2].
previous work has emphasized retinol loss from hsc’s.
troen et al. [25,26] documented greater than a 100-fold
decrease in retinol content after hsc were cultured for 14
days. attempts at replenishing intracellular retinol content
were unsuccessful and troen concluded that activated hsc
have lost the capacity to esterify retinol and store retinoids as
esters. the mechanism responsible for this inability to store
retinoids has remained elusive. weiner et al. [5] reported that
hsc lost expression of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors, as well as

media, retinol (1 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m). cell proliferation was determined by thymidine incorporation at days 0, 3, 5 and 7. hsc exposed to retinoids
had significantly less proliferation by day 7 but not at other time points. (b) effect of retinoids on proliferation of chronically activated hepatic stellate cells.
chronically activated hsc were replated on plastic and exposed to control media, retinol (1 ␮m) or  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m). cell proliferation was determined by
thymidine incorporation at days 0, 3, 5 and 7. hsc exposed to retinoids had no difference in proliferation compared to control hsc at any time points. error
bars are s.e.m.’s from five to six measurements.

their respective mrna’s as the hsc became activated. others have demonstrated a decrease in expression of the rar-␤,
rxr-␣ and rare receptors [27,8]. in contrast, weiner et al.
[5] found that cultured activated hsc contained undetectable
rar-␤ mrna or protein, but after treatment with retinoic
acid, began to produce mrna for rar-␤. in addition, they

documented that activated hsc isolated from fibrotic livers
also had no rar-␤. under these conditions, they felt that the
hsc were retinoid-unresponsive, and hence remained perpetually activated.
our data provides data on the retinoid responsiveness
of both freshly isolated hsc as they become activated and

(inset). results at day 3, 5, 7 and 10 are expressed as a fraction of day 0 after normalization for gadph mrna. freshly isolated hsc rapidly lost mrna

chronically activated hsc. we suggest that under certain circumstances recently activated hsc are not in an irreversible
state of retinoid unresponsiveness. rather, we hypothesize
that retinoid treatment can potentially decrease the activation
of freshly isolated hsc. however, this effect seems to be
temporary as retinoids can not prevent the loss of rar’s.
4.1. effect of retinoid supplementation on hsc
activation
the effects of retinol and  xxxd3417xxx  on hsc activation
demonstrate that both of these retinoids have a significant
effect upon freshly isolated hsc. markers of activation such

as ␣-sma expression and cell proliferation were diminished
in freshly isolated hsc exposed to retinoids. as demonstrated previously [4,23],  xxxd3417xxx  was a more potent
inhibitor of hsc activation than retinol. if binding of the
nuclear receptors for  xxxd3417xxx  were not important, one
would not anticipate such a profound difference in retinoid
effectiveness. retinol and the retinol esters are the endogenous storage substances that are normally present in hsc.
the mechanism by which retinol or the retinoid esters influence hsc activation remains elusive. extracellular retinoic
acid is rapidly taken up by hsc, binds to cellular retinoic
acid binding protein ( xxxg1938xxx ) and is transported to the nucleus
[17,28,2].  xxxd3417xxx  was essentially undetectable in hsc

232

m.t. milliano, b.a. luxon / hepatology research 33 (2005) 225–233

cytosol even in hsc supplemented with extracellular retinoic
acid. in contrast, exposure to extracellular retinol did increase
the intracellular content of retinol esters. hence, the mechanism of shuttling of  xxxd3417xxx  which is bound to cellular
 xxxd3417xxx  binding protein to the nucleus and its interaction
with the nuclear binding receptors is likely to be a key feature
in the action of  xxxd3417xxx . hence, we suggest that retinoic
acid has the in vivo capacity of reducing the activation of
freshly isolated hsc through specific nuclear interactions
not involving other forms of retinoids.
4.2. other nuclear  xxxd3417xxx  receptors
other nuclear receptors exist for  xxxd3417xxx  including
the rxr-␣, rxr-␤ and rxr-␥ [8,29]. we have focused on
rar-␣, rar-␤, and rar-␥ because others have shown that
these are the most selective of the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors [30].
it is not possible to confidently extrapolate our findings for
rar-␣, rar-␤, and rar-␥ to the other nuclear receptors.
however, based on previous work in other cell lines [8,29],
results obtained with rar-␣, rar-␤, and rar-␥ are typical
of all the nuclear receptors.
4.3. summary
our results show that hsc exposed to exogenous retinoids
(supplied as 1 and 100 ␮m retinol or 1 ␮m  xxxd3417xxx )
did not demonstrate toxicity based on desmin levels, cell
morphology, trypan blue exclusion or fluorescent dye exclusion. activation of freshly isolated hsc was significantly
decreased in hsc exposed to either retinol or  xxxd3417xxx 
with little or no increase in the intracellular retinoid concentration. nuclear expression of the  xxxd3417xxx  receptors decreased dramatically during activation of freshly isolated hsc even with supplementation of retinoids. rar-␤
was undetectable in chronically activated cells and remained
absent even after supplementation with  xxxd3417xxx . markers of activation (␣-sma expression and cell proliferation) in
chronically activated hsc were only slightly decreased after
exposure to retinoids for 7 days and did not decrease to levels seen in freshly isolated quiescent hsc. we interpret this
finding as consistent with chronically activated hsc being
“retinoid unresponsive” [5].
