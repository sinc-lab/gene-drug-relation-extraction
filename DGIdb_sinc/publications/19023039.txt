pharmacological characterization of  xxxg1664xxx  currents expressed in mammalian cells.  pannexin (panx) 1 is a widely expressed protein that shares structural, but not amino acid, homology with gap junction proteins, the connexins.  xxxg1664xxx  does not form gap junctions in mammalian cells, but it may function as a plasma membrane hemichannel. little is known of the pharmacological properties of  xxxg1664xxx  expression in mammalian cells. here, we identify three variants in the human  xxxg1664xxx  gene. we expressed these variants and mouse  xxxg1664xxx  in mammalian cells and compared  xxxg1664xxx -induced currents. all human  xxxg1664xxx  variants and the mouse  xxxg1664xxx  showed identical protein expression levels, localization patterns, and functional properties, although the frequency of functional expression was species-dependent.  xxxg1664xxx  currents were independent of changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium or phospholipase c transduction. we found compounds that inhibited  xxxg1664xxx  currents with a rank order of potency:  xxxd433xxx  > disodium 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (dids) approximately disodium 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2'-disulfonate approximately 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) xxxd306xxx  > indanyloxyacetic acid 94 >> probenecid >>  xxxd2122xxx  =  xxxd2723xxx . triphosphate nucleotides (atp, gtp, and utp) rapidly and reversibly inhibited  xxxg1664xxx  currents via mechanism(s) independent of purine receptors. when  xxxg1664xxx  was coexpressed with purinergic p2x(7) receptor (p2x(7)r), dids was found to act as a p2x(7)r antagonist to inhibit atp-evoked currents, but none of the other compounds inhibited p2x(7)r currents. this is the first detailed pharmacological characterization of  xxxg1664xxx -mediated currents in mammalian cells and sheds new, although contradictory, light on the hypothesis that  xxxg1664xxx  acts as a hemichannel to allow passage of large molecules in response to p2x(7)r activation.
