patients have been described previously (9). the seventh
patient was a 17-year-old woman with candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, addison disease, gonadal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. normal goat serum was obtained from dakopatts
(glostrup, denmark), and a specific rabbit serum against
 xxxg618xxx  ( xxxg618xxx ,  xxxg618xxx )
(anti- xxxg618xxx ) was purchased from biogenesis (poole, dorset,
u.k.).
construction of rinm 5f cdna library. the licl/urea
method (11) was used to prepare total cellular rna from the
rat insulinoma cell line rinm 5f. cells were cultured in ham's
f12 medium (nord vacc, skarholmen, sweden) supplemented
with nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal calf serum (fcs;
biochrom, berlin). poly(a)+ rna was purified with oligotex-dt (qiagen, chatsworth, ca). cdna was synthesized and
the library in the a zap ii vector was constructed according
to instructions of the supplier (stratagene), except for size
fractionation of the cdna, which was performed on a continuous 5-20%  xxxd2987xxx  gradient. five milliliters of
gradient was overlaid with 100 ,ul of 10 mm tris hcl and 1 mm
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), ph 7.4, containing
the synthesized cdna. after centrifugation for 3 hr at 50,000
rpm (230,000 x g) in an sw 50.1 rotor (beckman) at 22°c,
0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by electrophoresis
in a 1.0% agarose gel. fractions containing cdnas larger than
1000 bp were pooled and ligated into a zap ii. the completed
library, containing 4.5 x 106 recombinant clones, was amplified once.
immunoscreening of the library. we plated 5 x 105 plaqueforming units (pfu) of the amplified library on escherichia coli
xl-1 at a density of 350 pfu/cm2. after 3.5 hr of culture at
42°c, plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters (hybond
c, amersham) previously soaked with 10 mm isopropyl f-dthiogalactopyranoside (iptg; sigma) and cultured for another 3.5 hr at 37°c. the filters were carefully removed from
the plates and washed in 15 ml of 20 mm tris-hcl, ph
7.5/0.1% gelatin/0.05% tween-20 (tbs-gt) three times for
5 min. nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 15 ml of
1% gelatin in 20 mm tris hcl, ph 7.5, for 1 hr, after which the
filters were washed in tbs-gt as above. to reduce unspecific
binding of the secondary antibody during color development,
the filters were incubated with normal goat serum at a dilution
of 1/1000 in tbs-gt for 30 min. after a third wash cycle,
filters were incubated overnight with sera diluted 1/5000 in
tbs-gt, from one of the patients. filters were washed in 20
mm tris hci, ph 7.5, supplemented with 0.1% gelatin and
then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat
anti- xxxd2207xxx  for 1.5 hr prior to color development with a
p-nitrobluetetrazolium chloride (nbt)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-

abstract
different autoantigens are thought to be
involved in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, and they may account for the variation in the clinical
presentation of the disease. sera from patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type i contain autoantibodies
against the 13-cell proteins  xxxg913xxx  and an
unrelated 51-kda antigen. by screening of an expression
library derived from rat insulinoma cells, we have identified
the 51-kda protein as  xxxg618xxx 
( xxxg618xxx ). in addition to the previously published fulllength cdna, forms coding for a truncated and an alternatively spliced version were identified. aromatic l-amino acid
decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxylation of l-5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and that of l-3, xxxd2471xxx  to dopamine. interestingly,  xxxd3047xxx  is the
cofactor of both  xxxg618xxx  and
 xxxg913xxx . the biological significance of the
neurotransmitters produced by the two enzymes in the 18 cells
remains largely unknown.

the cell-specific destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic ,b cells in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( xxxg1193xxx ) is
mediated by autoimmune mechanisms.  xxxg913xxx  (gad), an enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of y- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) from glutamate, has been identified as
a major autoantigen (1). autoantibodies against this enzyme
are present in up to 80% of the patients with  xxxg1193xxx  (2, 3), and
prediabetic individuals often exhibit reactivity against gad
before the appearance of any clinical manifestations of the
disease (4). patients with  xxxg1193xxx  are prone to develop autoimmunity against other organs-e.g., addison disease and
graves disease (5). in the rare disease autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type i (aps i), an autoimmune attack
against the parathyroid glands, the adrenal glands, and the
gonads begins in childhood (6), whereas  xxxg1193xxx  may occur at
a higher age (5, 6). nonendocrine symptoms-e.g., chronic
mucocutaneous candidiasis, chronic active hepatitis, alopecia,
vitiligo, and malabsorption-are also frequent manifestations
of the disease (6). in the adrenal cortex (7) and gonads (8),
cytochrome p450 side-chain cleavage enzyme-the catalyst of
the rate-limiting step in the steroid synthesis-is the major
autoantigen. gad is recognized in the insulin-producing f3
cells by a majority of sera from aps i patients (9, 10). in
addition, strong reactivity against a 51-kda protein of previously unknown identity has been observed in all aps i sera
examined (9). the 51-kda protein has now been identified by
immunoscreening of a cdna library constructed from a rat
insulinoma cell line.t

immunoprecipitation. rinm 5f cells, transfected cos
cells, and isolated islets were washed twice in methionine-free
rpmi 1640 medium and then cultured for 6 hr in a medium
supplemented with [35s]methionine (>1100 ci/mmol; amersham; 1 ci = 37 gbq). after washing in nonradioactive
medium as above, cells and islets were lysed for 1 hr at 4°c in
a buffer of 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.2/1.0% triton x-100
(eastman kodak)/2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(pmsf; sigma)/20 mm nacl/1% trasylol (bayer, leverkusen, germany). insoluble membrane debris was removed
by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm (350,000 x g) in a tla-100.2
rotor (beckman) for 15 min. immunoprecipitations and sds/
page were performed as described previously (14).

indoyl phosphate/toluidine (bcip) system (bio-rad). positive
clones were rescreened until pure isolates were obtained.
dna sequence analysis. the nucleotide sequence of positive cdna clones was determined by the dideoxynucleotide
method (12) after subcloning into m13 derivatives. sequence
analysis was performed with the applied biosystems automatic dna sequenator 373a, using t7 dna polymerase
(sequenase) with either -21m13 dye primer (applied biosystems) or unlabeled synthesized internal primers (scandinavian
gene synthesis, koping, sweden) together with dye terminators (applied biosystems).
recombinant  xxxg618xxx . clone 3.1 was ligated into the not i
and kpn i sites of the pbk-cmv vector (stratagene) for
transient expression in cos cells. cos cells (2 x 106) were
cultured to 80% confluence, harvested by trypsin treatment,
washed twice in 10 ml of dulbecco's modified eagle's medium
(dmem; biochrom) buffered with 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, and
finally resuspended in 200 1.l of the same medium. fifty
micrograms of vector was added to the cells. after incubation
on ice for 10 min, electroporation was performed with a
bio-rad genepulser at 200 v and 500 mf. the cells were
incubated on ice for another 10 min and then seeded in dmem
containing 10% fcs. after 48 hr of culture, the cells were used
in immunoprecipitation experiments.
isolation of islets of langerhans. islets of langerhans from
wistar-furth rats were manually isolated after collagenase digestion (13) and cultured for 48 hr in rpmi 1640 medium (biochrom)
containing 11 mm glucose prior to metabolic labeling.

results
identification of the 51-kda antigen as  xxxg618xxx . a cdna
library from rinm sf rat insulinoma cells constructed in a
zap ii was screened with high-titer sera (1/5000 dilutions)
from patients with aps i. four positive clones were identified
and rescreened until pure isolates were obtained. nucleotide
sequence analyses revealed that all clones coded for the
 xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzyme  xxxg618xxx . clones 3.1
and 5.1 were identical to the reported full-length cdna (15)
coding for a protein of 480 amino acids with a calculated
molecular mass of 54 kda, whereas clones 10.5 and 10.7
corresponded to forms not previously described (fig. 1). clone
10.5 had a unique 3' untranslated sequence downstream of an

in-frame stop codon at position 1004 (codon 315), giving rise
to a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 35 kda. clone
10.7 was a splice variant coding for a protein in which the five
terminal amino acids in the protein coded for by clone 3.1/5.1
were replaced by eight different ones (fig. 1).
immunoprecipitation of rat islet and rinm 5f lysates.
immunoprecipitations of isolated [35s]methionine-labeled islets of langerhans from rats were performed to establish
whether the 51-kda protein and  xxxg618xxx  were identical. all
sera from patients with aps i precipitated a 51-kda protein
which comigrated with  xxxg618xxx  precipitated by a specific
anti- xxxg618xxx  serum (fig. 2 left). in accordance with previous
data (9), a majority of the sera (5 of 7) also precipitated a
doublet of approximately 65 kda corresponding to gad.
furthermore, when a lysate from rinm sf cells was precleared with the specific anti- xxxg618xxx  serum, the ability of
patient sera to subsequently immunoprecipitate the 51-kda
autoantigen was abolished (fig. 2 right).
immunoprecipitation of recombinant  xxxg618xxx . to confirm
the identity of the 51-kda protein, clone 3.1 was ligated into
the pbk-cmv vector. after transient expression in cos cells,
all aps i sera immunoprecipitated  xxxg618xxx  (fig. 3, lanes a, c,
e, and g), while no reactivity was detected in cos cells
transfected with the empty vector (fig. 3, lanes b, d, f, and h).
identical results were obtained with the alternatively spliced
cdna clone 10.7, whereas the truncated clone 10.5 gave no
immunoprecipitate at the predicted position around 35 kda
(not shown). sera from 20 patients with  xxxg1193xxx  of recent onset,
3 patients with stiff man syndrome, and 20 healthy blood
donors did not immunoprecipitate  xxxg618xxx  (not shown).

and around the  xxxd3047xxx -binding site, asp-prohis-lys (17). the fact that no relation between reactivities
against  xxxg618xxx  and gad was found in individual patients and
the observation that an anti- xxxg618xxx  antibody did not crossreact with gad indicate that there was no cross-reactivity
between gad autoantibodies and  xxxg618xxx .
 xxxg618xxx  catalyzes the decarboxylation of aromatic l-amino
acids, notably l-3, xxxd2471xxx  (dopa) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-ht), which are intermediates in the synthesis of catecholamine and indolamine neurotransmitters
(18). in drosophila melanogaster two different forms of  xxxg618xxx 
have been described, one in the nervous system and the other
in the hypoderm (19). neuronal and nonneuronal forms of the
enzyme have also been observed in the rat (20), with a unique
5' untranslated sequence in the neuronal form. we have now
found evidence that additional isoforms of the protein may be
present in 3 cells, namely a splice variant in which the five final
carboxyl-terminal amino acids are replaced by eight new ones
and a truncated form with a calculated molecular mass of 35
kda. it remains to be established whether the truncated form
is a naturally occurring protein. at present we cannot rule out
the possibility that the cdna coding for this predicted form

organ (16). in the present work we show that  xxxg618xxx , in
addition to gad, is a major autoantigen in , cells in aps i.
interestingly, both gad and  xxxg618xxx  are pyridoxal phosphatedependent enzymes producing neurotransmitters by catalyzing
the decarboxylation of amino acids. sequence comparison
between the enzymes has shown low overall sequence similarity (17), except for short stretches of sequence identity at

represents a cloning artifact. our findings may explain the
reported biochemical data suggesting the existence of  xxxg618xxx 
isoforms with preference for dopa and 5-ht (21). apart from
being present in the ,3 cells and other cells capable of amine
precursor uptake and decarboxylation, including the enterochromaffin cells of the intestine,  xxxg618xxx  is also found in the
liver and kidney (22, 23). its presence in the liver and enterochromaffin cells of the intestine may explain the hepatitis and
malabsorption seen in aps i patients. interestingly, tyrosinase
has recently been reported to be an autoantigen in autoimmune vitiligo, which is part of the aps i syndrome (24). this
enzyme, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, oxidizes dopa to dopa quinone. we found no reactivity
against  xxxg618xxx  in a small group of patients with  xxxg1193xxx .
however, subgroups with such reactivity may exist-e.g.,
 xxxg1193xxx  patients with neuropathy, liver affection (25), or other
organ-specific autoimmune manifestations.
the functional importance of neurotransmitters produced
by the  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes gad and
 xxxg618xxx  in pancreatic 1b cells is unclear. it has been suggested
that gaba, as part of the gaba cycle, may represent means
by which the cell can utilize glutamate as a reserve energy
source (26). dopamine and serotonin produced by  xxxg618xxx 
could be involved in the regulation of insulin synthesis and
secretion (27). it may also be speculated that  xxxg618xxx  may
decarboxylate unknown regulator molecules (28).
gad and  xxxg618xxx  are both intracellular enzymes. gad is
mainly found in synaptic-like small vesicles (slmv; ref. 29),
whereas  xxxg618xxx  is located in the cytosol (30). since antibodies
are directed against antigens on the cell surface, it is unclear
how autoantibodies against the intracellular enzymes gad
and  xxxg618xxx  could be participating in the pathogenesis of
 xxxg1193xxx . peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients with
 xxxg1193xxx  have been demonstrated to proliferate in vitro on
exposure to gad (31, 32), indicating a role of cell-mediated
immunity. even though it has been suggested that the initial
lesion is likely to be t-cell mediated and the presence of

autoantibodies merely reflects 13-cell destruction, as markers
of the disease, it cannot be ruled out that autoantibodies do
take part in the pathogenesis of  xxxg1193xxx .
it has recently been observed that amino acids 250-273 of
gad 65 show sequence similarity with amino acids 28-50 of
the coxsackievirus b protein p2-c (33, 34). it was proposed
that, as a result of this molecular mimicry, cross-reactive t-cell
proliferation will occur, leading to autoimmune destruction of
the ,b cells. however, we have not been able to find any
evidence of molecular mimicry between  xxxg618xxx  and any
known microorganism upon search of protein data bases.
the fact that  xxxg618xxx  and gad, two important enzymes for
the generation of neurotransmitters, act as autoantigens in the
islets of langerhans underlines the neuron-like nature of the
13 cells. in the central nervous system the blood-brain barrier
seems to protect these enzymes from an immune attack, except
in the rare cases of stiff man syndrome, where autoantibodies
against gad are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (35).
when, as in the 3 cell,  xxxg618xxx  or gad is not protected by any
barrier, autoaggressive responses may develop more easily.
