abstract.
melatonin acts both as a hormone of the pineal gland and
as a local regulator molecule in various tissues. quantities
of total tissue melatonin exceed those released from the
pineal. with regard to this dual role, to the orchestrating,
systemic action on various target tissues, melatonin is
highly pleiotropic. numerous secondary effects result from
the control of the circadian pacemaker and, in seasonal
breeders, of the hypothalamic/pituitary hormonal axes. in
mammals, various binding sites for melatonin have been
identified, the membrane receptors mt1 and mt2, which are
of utmost chronobiological importance, ror and rzr
isoforms as nuclear receptors from the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor
superfamily,  xxxg1593xxx , calmodulin,  xxxg323xxx ,
and mitochondrial binding sites. the g protein-coupled
receptors (gpcrs) mt1 and mt2 are capable of parallel or

alternate signaling via different ga subforms, in particular,
gai2/3 and  xxxg923xxx , and via gbc, as well. multiple signaling can
lead to the activation of different cascades and/or ion
channels. melatonin frequently decreases camp, but also
activates phospholipase c and protein kinase c, acts via the
map kinase and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase/akt pathways, modulates large
conductance ca2þ-activated kþ and voltage-gated ca2þ
channels. mt1 and mt2 can form homo and heterodimers,
and mt1 interacts with other proteins in the plasma
membrane, such as an orphan gpcr, gpr50, and the pdz
domain scaffolding protein mupp1, effects which negatively
or positively influence signaling capacity. cross-talks
between different signaling pathways, including influences
of the membrane receptors on nuclear binding sites, are
discussed.

1. introduction
the indoleamine melatonin ( xxxd2559xxx )
has become known as the hormone of the pineal gland,
which conveys the signal ‘‘darkness,’’ a function that is
related to both circadian and seasonal time measurement
and includes chronobiotic effects, that is, the capacity of
phase shifting, in a feedback loop, the circadian pacemaker,
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) [1–3]. these actions are
relatively well-understood, notwithstanding the necessity of
clarification of some details. however, melatonin is not a
hormone alone [4–6]. this indoleamine is additionally
secreted via the pineal recess to the cerebrospinal fluid, in
initial concentrations much higher than those released to
the blood [7,8]. it is also produced in numerous extrapineal
tissues and cells, such as retina, gastrointestinal tract, bone
marrow, leukocytes, membraneous cochlea, harderian gland,

and, perhaps, also skin and brain areas [3–6,9,10]. in mammals, its overall amounts found in tissues exceed by orders
of magnitude those present in the pineal and in the circulation. from the extrapineal sites, it is either only poorly
released or, as in the case of the gastrointestinal tract, it
can be secreted in high amounts as a postprandial surge,
however, without profound chronobiological consequences
[6,9,10]. melatonin can be also taken up from the food and
undergoes enterohepatic cycling [10,11]. one may notice in
this context that melatonin is not only found in vertebrates,
but also is present in various, phylogenetically distant taxa,
including bacteria, algae, plants, fungi, and invertebrate animals [12–14]. it may even act as a phytohormone in various
plants [15,16]. although the nonvertebrate melatonin shall
not be in the focus of this article, the wide distribution
among organisms sheds light on a multiplicity of functions,
which is also reflected by enormous differences in concentrations reported for the various species. in mammals, the
pleiotropy of melatonin can be related to different levels of
action, namely, (i) to distribution and density of receptors
and other binding sites in the various tissues and cell types,
(ii) to parallel or alternate signaling via different g proteins
controlled by membrane-bound receptors, (iii) to multiple,
183

structurally divergent binding sites of different subcellular
localization and, presumably, also (iv) to actions of melatonin metabolites formed in tissue-specific pathways. signaling
mechanisms and the levels of pleiotropy will be discussed in
this overview, with particular reference to mammals.

2. orchestrating hormone and local
 xxxg748xxx 
before going into the details of the signaling mechanisms, it
seems necessary to perceive the different roles that melatonin
plays in a mammalian body. the classical one—of utmost
physiological relevance—is that of a chemical mediator of
darkness [1–4]. basis is the rhythmic synthesis and release of
melatonin from the pineal gland, to both the blood and the
cerebrospinal fluid [1–4,7,8]. in its function as a hormone, it is
arriving rhythmically at practically every tissue and cell.
responses will, of course, largely depend on the presence of
receptors and other binding sites, but, additionally, interactions with reactive intermediates not requiring receptors have
been assumed [3,6,12,17–19]. by virtue of its amphiphilicity,
melatonin can easily cross membranes and, therefore, enter
cells, so that actions may be expected which are independent
of membrane receptors. the high-amplitude circadian rhythm
of circulating melatonin can, thus, be ‘‘sensed’’ by many cells,
even if they are devoid of classical membrane receptors for
this hormone, which act via g protein-mediated signaling
mechanisms. therefore, a representation of the dark phase
within the photoperiodic cycle seems to be possible in numerous places of the mammalian body. nevertheless, membrane
receptors for melatonin are present in many tissues, including,
for example, vasculature, immune cells, and various vegetative
organs [4,20]. the marked chronobiological, receptor-mediated
effects exerted at the levels of peripheral tissues and cells can
either consist of direct up or downregulations of enzymes,
genes, and ion channels, or may cause synchronization of peripheral circadian oscillators present in numerous cells. these
peripheral actions have to be discriminated from effects of
melatonin on the central circadian pacemaker, the scn, and,
in seasonal breeders, on reproduction-related hypothalamic
and hypophyseal structures, in particular, median eminence
and pars tuberalis. very high densities of membrane receptors
have been found in both the scn [20–24] and the pars tuberalis [22,24,25]. as will be discussed later in detail, the effects
via membrane receptors in the scn are responsible for the socalled chronobiotic actions, that is, phase-shifting at the circadian pakemaker scn, with profound secondary effects on
‘‘slave’’ rhythms under control of this hypothalamic area.
however, melatonin’s role cannot be solely seen under
the aforementioned aspects. because of relatively high
amounts outside the pineal and retina, another intermediate
brain-derived structure, a view on the chronobiology of tissue melatonin reveals that the amplitudes of melatonin
rhythms in several organs are much lower than in the circulation or can be even virtually absent [6,10,19,26]. this
holds, in particular, for the gut and the harderian gland.
anyway, the transmission of dark signals seems to be rather
184

unlikely in organs such as bone marrow or gastrointestinal
tract. again, the conclusion has to be that melatonin plays
additional roles in these tissues. however, it would be too
simple to just assume that this additional role were exclusively direct radical scavenging, since, in stoichiometric
terms, melatonin quantities would be frequently insufficient.
alternately, a role of tissue melatonin as a source of bioactive metabolites, which can be also formed to a certain
extent by nonenzymatic mechanisms, should be taken into
consideration [6,10,19,26]. moreover, the antioxidant properties of melatonin, which may be particularly important in tissues rich in this indoleamine, are based on multiple actions.
some of them involve signaling and gene expression, while
others seem to be exerted by interactions with enzymes, ion
channels or electron transport. collectively, these effects
may predominantly serve radical avoidance rather than
detoxification of radicals already formed [19,26].
in conclusion, the pleiotropy of melatonin is not only
reflected by the existence of numerous target organs, but
also by its formation in extrapineal sites, by low or almost
absent circadian dynamcis in some tissues, indicating additional noncircadian functions, by formation of bioactive
metabolites, and by specific subcellular actions, for example,
in mitochondria, which exceed the usual spectrum of hormonal signaling [4,6]. although roles and signaling mechanisms
of tissue melatonin are poorly understood to date, it seems
that the coexistence of endo, para, auto, and intracrine
actions of melatonin [5] goes beyond local feedback effects
common to other hormones, which are mostly mediated by
the same receptors, or variants of them, as found in the respective target organs. additional binding sites different
from membrane receptors may be of importance in the case
of tissue melatonin. moreover, melatonin displays as remarkable contextual diversity of functions, reaching from the control of circadian pacemakers and hypothalamic/pituitary axes
to, for example, vasomotor effects, various facets of immunomodulation, antioxidant actions including expression of
genes relevant to redox metabolism, direct and indirect antiapoptotic effects, interference with no signaling, other antiexcitatory actions via ion channels and neurotransmitter systems, and modulation of mitochondrial electron flux.

3. membrane receptors
membrane receptors of melatonin were identified in the pioneering work by reppert et al., who first cloned a receptor
from xenopus melanocytes and who later found homologs in
other vertebrate species [27–29]. in mammals, two receptor
subtypes are present, mt1 and mt2 (in earlier terminology
called mel1a and mel1b) [20–24,28,29]. the original terminology is sometimes maintained in studies on nonmammalian
vertebrates or in comparative work, because a third melatonin receptor type is present in these organisms, mel1c, to
which no denomination corresponding to mt1 or mt2 is
allowed, for formal reasons of nomenclature. because of its
absence in mammals, this third receptor subtype shall not
be discussed here in detail. only the hint shall be given that
biofactors

functionally different isoforms of mel1c have been described,
which deviate in signaling and cause decreases in cyclic
gmp [30].
mt1 and mt2 are typical g protein-coupled receptors
(gpcrs) of 350 and 362 amino acids, respectively, with the
characteristic seven transmembrane domains [20,27,28,
31,32]. glycosylation sites have been detected in the n-terminal region and, more importantly, the fourth intracellular
loops of either receptor contain palmitoylatable cystein residues [33], and the c-terminal domains putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinases a and c as well as casein kinases 1 and 2 [20]. although receptor desensitization has
been repeatedly discussed, for example, in the context of
limited melatoninergic actions on sleep [34], relatively few
studies have dealt with the analysis of downregulation, and
have usually been conducted in transfected cells [33,35,36].
a recent study using site-directed mutagenesis [33] showed
that neither the replacement of the palmitoylation site by alanine nor the truncation of the c-terminal domain containing
the phosphorylation sites altered receptor affinity. however,
the presence of both the lipid anchor and the c-terminal tail
were required for g protein interaction, as judged from the
lack of the camp response. the phosphorylation, but not the
palmitoylation sites were required for internalization, indicating the usual internalization process via phosphorylation and
b-arrestin binding. internalization of mt2 was also demonstrated in immortalized scn2.2 cells [36], an effect relevant
to circadian phase shifting as discussed next. in these
experiments, recovery from the melatonin-induced decrease
in surface-exposed mt2 receptors required about 8 hours, a
time span that may be related to the duration of a night.
mt1 was reported to be less efficiently internalized than mt2
[37], an effect which may be of functional significance, but
this study had been conducted in transfected cho cells, so
the relevance for major sites of action such as the scn
remains to be further clarified.
mt1 and mt2 differ in their affinities to the natural
ligand. for the human receptors, ki values of 80.7 and 383
pm, respectively, have been determined [38]. this is in the
range of that found in other species, although sometimes
higher inhibition or dissociation constants have been
reported [39].
mt1 and mt2 are found in numerous places, and all
chronobiotic effects via the scn are mediated by these two
receptors [20,29,40]. in this pacemaker, melatonin affects,
under both in vivo and in vitro conditions, circadian phase,
and amplitude. phase-shifting is preferentially exerted via
mt2, whereas neuronal firing is acutely suppressed through
mt1 [20,29,40,41]. however, the two receptor subtypes are
complementary in their actions and can, to a limited extent,
mutually substitute for each other. in the extreme, one of
these receptors can be exceptionally missing, as shown in
two siberian hamsters, phodopus sungorus and ph. campbelli [42], which lack active mt2 receptors.
the actions of melatonin on the circadian pacemaker
scn represent a feedback loop involved in the readjustment
of the oscillator, since the mammalian pineal gland itself is
under control of the scn. signaling mechanisms of melatomelatonin signaling

nin have been most thoroughly studied in this pacemaker.
the classical effect on both receptors is transmitted by pertussis toxin-sensitive gi proteins (fig. 1), which cause a
decrease in camp, followed by declines in pka activity and
creb phosphorylation [20,29,43,44]. the inhibition of
adenylyl cyclase is not only evident in purely experimental
situations, like counteraction of  xxxd1742xxx -induced rises
[20,43], but also in a context physiologically relevant to the
scn, namely, the antagonism to pituitary adenylyl cyclase
activating peptide ( xxxg70xxx )-induced stimulation of adenylyl
cyclase and creb phosphorylation [29,45]. interestingly,
melatonin failed to suppress the  xxxg70xxx  response of pcreb
formation in aging mice [45], which indicates a loss of functional sensitivity of the scn to the indoleamine.
mt1 and mt2 have been detected in many tissues,
such as retina, other brain areas, choroid plexus, cerebral
and peripheral vasculature, harderian gland, reproductive
organs including myometrium, and adrenal cortex [20,46].
despite low expression levels in some of these tissues, the
ample distribution of the membrane receptors indicates melatonin responsiveness of numerous peripheral organs [46].
the most frequently involved a subforms are ai2 and ai3
[39,47,48]. although ai-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase represents a prominent and most frequently observed
effect, signaling via mt1 and mt2 can, in fact, be more complex [4,20,43,44]. parallel signaling through different g protein subforms and also bc heterodimers (fig. 1) has been
observed in various tissues or cells, and even alternate signaling seems to exist in some cases. however, one should
be aware that signal transduction via different g protein subforms is strongly cell type-specific and depends on the
expression of the numerous variants of a subunits, and also
on availability of their downstream interaction partners.
therefore, studies in transfected cells in vitro can only identify a spectrum of possibilities, but not the physiologically
relevant route in a specific cell type in vivo. moreover, overexpression of a receptor upon transfection enhances the
probability of interaction with other partners including less
abundant g proteins.
in the mammalian scn, multiple signaling should, at
least, be relevant in the case of mt2. in addition to the
known decline in camp, mt2 activation caused rises in pkc,
which were blocked by the mt2-selective antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetraline (4p-pdot) and required for the
phase shift of the circadian rhythm [40]. corresponding
results concerning the rises of pkc in relation to phase
advances had been previously obtained [49]. later, the findings on mt2-dependent pkc activation were confirmed in
immortalized scn2.2 cells [32]. pkc activation should not be
the consequence of decreases in camp, but rather be based
on other effects of g protein subunits. several g proteindependent activation mechanisms are possible, some of
them involving phospholipase c (plc) [50], in particular, isoforms of plcb or, perhaps, plcg. this may be conveyed either by ai coupling to plc subforms, which would be in line
with the observed sensitivity to pertussis toxin, or alternately, by another a subform, such as aq. the third possibility would consist in plc activation by bc (fig. 1). finally,

various pathways, which are not collectively present in every target cell. moreover, mt1- and mt2-dependent signaling
pathways, which are only partially identical, are combined, because of possible heterodimerization and uncertainties
concerning several cell types (for known differences see current text). additional routes or interconnections are likely
to exist. in particular, parallel signaling within the map kinase route, exceeding the mentioned  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway, has
been omitted. dotted lines refer to assumed pathways, which deserve further substantiation in the tissues. roles of

biofactors

indirect effects via g protein-dependent opening ion channels might lead to rises in pkc activity at the membrane.
in fact, melatonin-induced effects via aq or via bc on
plc b isoforms, and also pertussin toxin-sensitive opening
of potassium channels have been observed in other tissues
or transfected cells. in rat uterine myocytes, parallel signaling through gi and gq was demonstrated indirectly, by studying the opening of large-conductance ca2þ-activated kþ
channels (bkca) [51]. a pertussis toxin-sensitive effect on
channel opening was antagonized by  xxxd2401xxx  and,
thus, mediated by ai via decreases on camp and pka activity, whereas a pertussis toxin-insensitive effect, presumably
mediated by aq, was blocked by the plc inhibitor u-73122.
blockade of bkca was also reported to inhibit the vasoconstrictor action of melatonin in cerebral and caudal arteries
[20,52,53]. however, in one of the original studies [54], neither changes in camp nor in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis were induced by melatonin, so that
authors assumed actions via ca2þ influx. inward rectifier kþ
channels (kir channels) were also concluded to serve as targets of melatonin receptors. in the xenopus oocyte system
[55] and in transfected att20 cells [56],  xxxg1252xxx  and 3.2 were
shown to be activated by mt1, via a pertussis toxin-sensitive
mechanism that involves presumably bc, since these heterodimers are known to directly couple to kir channels. modulation of ca2þ channels by melatonin, as observed in the rat
pituitary, may be likewise mediated by bc [56]. site-directed
mutagenesis in mt1 allowed a dissection of camp downregulation and coupling to kir3 channels [56]. high external kþ,
in turn, opens voltage-dependent ca2þ channels, an effect
which is inhibited by melatonin. again, point mutations of
mt1 analyzed in transfected att20 cells showed a loss of inhibition. however, the inhibition of voltage-gated ca2þ channels was only partially blocked by pertussis toxin, so that
parallel signaling by different g proteins seems likely [56].
these findings on mt1 signaling towards kir and calcium
channels are of high potential importance because they can
presumably explain the mt1-mediated suppressive effects of
melatonin on neuronal firing in the scn, where these channels are expressed.
parallel signaling involving other g proteins, such as
gq/g11, go, gz, or g16, has been observed in various studies
using transfected cells (hek293, cos-7, cho cells), although
some findings concerning go and gz may be ambiguous. collectively, these data show that both melatonin receptors can
multiply interact with various, pertussis toxin-sensitive as
well as -insensitive g proteins [4,39,47,48,57–60]. although
parallel signaling per se is, therefore, beyond doubt, many
details concerning the various a subforms are awaiting further substantiation in the tissues.
parallel signal transduction leads, in turn, to a host of
secondary effects, especially when ca2þ levels are involved.
activations of plc and pkc, and also bc dimers released
from gi, stimulate the map kinase pathway ( xxxg1361xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /
2, c- xxxg1370xxx  ¼ jnk), and additional effects via
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) and its downstream elements (e.g., akt ¼ pkb) as well as further modulation of various transcription factors are possible. however, the situamelatonin signaling

tion is insofar more complicated as erk can also be
activated via b-arrestin 2 bound to the phosphorylated receptor, as shown for many gpcrs [61]. the complex signaling network can include further interactions between, for
example, jnk and pi3k, as well as activation of pi3k by bc,
among other possibilities. in fact, various of these secondary
consequences have been reported [4,58,60]. contrary to
stimulations of cell proliferation, as could be expected from
activation of the map kinase pathway, decreases of phospho-akt by melatonin have been related to antiproliferative
effects in huvecs [62]. with regard to the possible and cell
type-dependent complexity of the signaling pathways and
their interconnections, much more information is required
for relevant tissues in vivo, and generalizations should be
avoided in the present state of knowledge.
another potentially important aspect of melatonin signaling concerns effects on cgmp. although rises in cgmp
have been repeatedly observed (summarized in ref. 48), and
despite assumptions concerning the involvement of cgmp
phosphodiesterase, a gap is still existing concerning the
direct demonstration of the responsible mechanism.
increases of cgmp were assumed to enhance calcium uptake
through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels [49,63], effects
which would have numerous further consequences. on the
other hand, mt2-mediated decreases in cgmp have been
also described, especially when antagonizing the accumulation caused by  xxxd2388xxx  in insulinoma b cells [64]. although
these findings may be highly relevant for understanding the
inhibition of insulin secretion by melatonin, such findings, as
in any other cases of cgmp downregulation, would require
clarification concerning the inhibition of no synthases. in
other studies, this has been addressed, but in an investigation on the inhibition of vascular bradykinin-induced rises in
no and cgmp, neither mt1, mt2 nor the melatonin binding
protein  xxxg1593xxx  were apparently involved [65].
the complexity of melatonin signaling through its
membrane receptors is still worth of further detailed studies.
it can even reveal previously unexpected effects, in which
signaling pathways originating from mt1 and mt2 turn out to
be antagonistic. in the vascular system, mt1 activation
causes a pertussis toxin-sensitive vasoconstriction, perhaps
involving bkca channels as discussed above, whereas mt2
exerts vasodilator effects [4,20].
a newly emerging field of melatonin membrane receptors is that of their interactions with proteins other than g
proteins, protein kinases and phosphatases controlling c-terminal phosphorylation or b-arrestin binding to these sites
(fig. 2). a recent study showed an interaction between the
c-tail of mt1—but not that of mt2—and the pdz domain protein mupp1 (pdz ¼  xxxg642xxx /drosophila disc large/ xxxg2286xxx 
homology; mupp1 ¼ multi-pdz domain protein 1) [66]. both
proteins are expressed in the ovine pars tuberalis. among
the 13 pdz domains present in mupp1, pdz10 is obviously
responsible for functional interaction with the c-tail. binding
of mupp1 to mt1 did not alter localization or trafficking, but
its disruption, by coexpression of pdz fragments in hek293
cells, abolished the camp response and gradually diminished erk phosphorylation, which should have been
187

fig. 2. gpcr dimerizations of the melatonin membrane receptors and interaction with the multi-pdz domain
scaffolding protein mupp1. with regard to experiences with other gpcrs, additional, cell type-specific
heterodimerizations seem possible, but have not been demonstrated. heterodimers with inhibitory gpcrs or orphan
analogs should prevent internalization, but this process may be affected by interaction with other, noninhibitory
gpcrs, too.

stimulated by bc, so that mupp1 seems to be required for
high-affinity binding of gi to mt1. another area of prospective significance is that of heterodimerization with other g
protein-coupled receptors (fig. 2). this phenomenon has
been reported for numerous gpcrs and, moreover, relatively
many members of this family are still orphan receptors and
may exert regulatory effects on other gpcrs. heterodimerization between mt1 and mt2 has been observed, as well as
homodimerization of mt1 and, to a lesser extent of mt2 [67],
but is has been debated to what extent this may represent
overexpression artifacts in transfected cells. nevertheless,
both homo and heterodimerizations of gpcrs, and even formation of oligomer arrays are common phenomena, which
are, however, only partially understood in their consequences, for example, for ligand affinity and internalization. in
some cases, heterodimerizations are functionally obligatory,
such as in the gabab and various taste receptors [68]. with
regard to the melatonin receptors, this is, however, an open
field, which requires further attention. the melatonin-associated receptor gpr50 was shown to heterodimerize with mt1,
but not mt2 (fig. 2), thereby abolishing high-affinity agonist
binding and g protein coupling [69]. according to that study,
the c-terminal domain of gpr50 was required for the interaction with mt1, although dimerizations of gpcrs are usually
mediated by interactions of transmembrane helices (iv and
v, plus additional forces involving i and ii). gpr50 is still
classified as an orphan receptor, but is has meanwhile been
shown to be an ortholog of mel1c [70] and to be downregulated by short-days in the third ventricle ependymal layer of
188

siberian hamsters [71], a finding indicating physiological significance in seasonality. in principle, numerous further possibilities of heterodimerization with other gpcrs may exist,
including their orphans, a field worth of future investigation.

4. the other binding sites
much less is known about the other melatonin binding sites,
although they may be of particular importance for tissue
melatonin. a melatonin binding protein that was originally
suspected to represent another membrane receptor, and already named mt3, finally turned out to be a primarily cytosolic enzyme,  xxxg1593xxx  (¼  xxxg1593xxx  ¼ nrh:quinone
oxidoreductase 2 ¼  xxxg1593xxx ; nrh ¼ dihydronicotinamide riboside) [72,73]. although several hypotheses have been forwarded, the function of melatonin at this enzyme is not
really understood. despite the development of several synthetic ligands for this binding site and the description of various effects [4,6], the lack of a known signaling pathway
does not allow mechanistic conclusions.
nuclear binding sites of melatonin have been a matter
of considerable debate. numerous publications have dealt
with melatonin-binding transcription factors belonging to the
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor superfamily, in particular, rora1,
rora2,  xxxg1971xxx , and  xxxg1972xxx  [3,74,75]. their classification as nuclear receptors seems meanwhile justified, although their affinity to melatonin is lower (kd values in the lower nanomolar range). a synthetic ligand, cgp 52608 [74], has been
biofactors

repeatedly used for identifying effects by these nuclear proteins. rora1 and rora2 seem to be involved in some
aspects of immune modulation, and  xxxg1972xxx  is expressed in
the central nervous system, including the pineal gland [3]. in
the context of melatonin’s protective actions,  xxxg1971xxx  was
assumed to mediate upregulations of antioxidant enzymes
[76]. although response elements for these transcription factors have been identified [77,78], and although transactivation in reporter assays has been demonstrated [79], most of
the studies have been restricted to the demonstration of
ror/rzr expression, or to rather global effects of cgp
52608, so that the information on specific up or downregulation of individual genes has remained remarkably scarce.
 xxxg1971xxx  leads to the suppression of  xxxg147xxx  expression
in b lymphocytes [80]. recently,  xxxg1971xxx  was shown to upregulate  xxxg1048xxx  (hypoxia-inducible factor 1a) expression [81], an
effect which may go beyond the mere response to hypoxia
and could be linked to antioxidant actions, because of  xxxg1048xxx  modulation by free radicals. another effect of potential
importance was reported for the scn, in which  xxxg1971xxx  was
related to the upregulation of the bmal1 gene [78], that is, a
clock gene playing an essential role in the cellular circadian
oscillator. whether this action is also involved in melatonininduced phase shifting remains to be analyzed in detail. heterodimerization, which is not uncommon with other retinoid
receptors, and interference with other transcription factors
have not been fully addressed for the melatonin-binding
ror/rzr isoforms. an earlier article [77] described binding
of dimers of the coup-tf transcription factor to the ror/
rzr response element. in summary, it seems that the full
spectrum and physiological meaning of ror/rzr receptors
are awaiting more detailed investigation und future
clarification.
as another melatonin-binding protein, calmodulin
(cam) was described. with regard to its numerous functions
as  xxxg220xxx  and regulator of several protein kinases and
other enzymes, an interaction with melatonin would be of
considerable significance, if the affinity were sufficient.
although earlier studies indicated that melatonin binding
could occur at elevated physiological concentrations [82,83],
more recent determinations speak for a much lower affinity
[84,85]. thus, it remains open whether some important melatonin effects previously ascribed to interference with cam,
such as inhibitions of cam kinase ii [86] and of neuronal no
synthase [87], are indirectly caused via other signaling
mechanisms, for example, starting from membrane receptors, or whether an indispensable player modulating affinity
has been missing in the recent determinations.
another calcium-binding protein,  xxxg323xxx , was also
reported to represent a melatonin-binding protein [88]. in
the same study, two other, functionally not yet characterized
nuclear binding proteins, one of them with homology to  xxxg323xxx , were also described as putative binding sites. the
relevance of these proteins in melatonin signaling remains
to be identified. finally, two mitochondrial binding sites have
been identified. one of them exhibits only a relatively low
affinity (ic50 ¼ 0.8 lm) and is associated with the inhibition
of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a melatomelatonin signaling

nin effect preventing apoptosis [89]. for the other one, a
much higher affinity was determined (kd ¼ 150 pm) (data by
m. pappolla and b. poeggeler, cited in ref. 6).displacement
studies with capsaicin and dopamine indicated localization
at the amphipathic ramp of complex i in the electron transport chain [90]. this speaks for a modulatory role of melatonin at this bottleneck for electron flux, and the major site of
electron leakage as well, but details will have to be worked
out.

5. conclusion
although the multiple signaling pathways of melatonin,
along with their cell type-specific consequences for the respective regulatory endpoints, may already appear highly
complex, one should be aware that the pleiotropy of melatonin’s actions is not yet fully described on that basis. the
section on parallel signaling had already indicated that the
cascades may be sometimes crosslinked, so that a single
protein kinase or a transcription factor may be activated by
mechanisms starting from different regulator molecules,
such as ga variants, bc dimers, b-arrestin, or ion channels.
the precise interconnections widely remain to be clarified.
this complexity will be even higher, if different pathways are
cross-talking to each other, which may occur at different levels. at the receptor level, this may start with heterodimerization. cross-talks may even occur between entirely different
receptor types for the same hormone, such as membrane
and nuclear receptors of melatonin. a recent study on t lymphocytes and jurkat cells indicated that the  xxxg1476xxx 
stimulates  xxxg1971xxx  expression [91]. should this turn out to be
a more general effect found in other cells, too, numerous, to
date poorly understood, results might become explained.
with regard to the orchestrating function of melatonin,
this indoleamine regulates the formation and secretion of
numerous other hormones, and also acts antagonistic or
synergistic to them in common target cells. not only crosstalks between signaling mechanisms, but also countless secondary effects via changes in other hormone concentrations
should result, a field exceeding by far the scope of this
review. the same holds for interactions with different neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and  xxxg259xxx  systems in
the central nervous system, in which several interconnections with potential consequences for neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and aging have become apparent
[92]. this network seems to comprise nonhepatic metabolites of melatonin, some of which are bioactive agents, too,
such as 5-methoxytryptamine,  xxxd70xxx —which is
not only precursor but also metabolite of melatonin—n1-acetyl-n2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (afmk) and n1-acetyl-5methoxykynuramine (amk) (summarized in refs. 4, 6, and
92).although many details remain to be identified, especially
concerning the respective signaling cascades of the metabolites, such findings again shed light on the exceptional pleiotropy of melatonin, which exceeds receptor distribution and
parallely or alternately activated g proteins.
