abstract
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (atc) remains one of the
most lethal human cancers. we hypothesized that
sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the  xxxg268xxx , vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-b kinase, would decrease tumor
growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic model of atc.
the in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of
sorafenib on atc cell lines were examined. to study the
in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic atc tumors in
nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg
daily. intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. the effect of sorafenib on survival of
the mice was also studied. sorafenib inhibited the in vitro
proliferation of atc cell lines. sorafenib also significantly
inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer.
as result, the growth of orthotopic atc xenografts was
reduced and the survival of the test animals was
improved. sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity
in an orthotopic xenograft model of atc via a potent

antiangiogenic effect. the antiangiogenic effects of
sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not
depend on the  xxxg268xxx  mutational status of thyroid tumors.
given the lack of curative options for patients with atc,
sorafenib warrants further study as a therapeutic agent
against atc. [mol cancer ther 2007;6(6):1785 – 92]

introduction
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (atc), which accounts for
1.6% of all thyroid cancers, is one of the most aggressive
human malignancies (1, 2). the average length of survival
following diagnosis is only 4 to 6 months (2, 3), and the
disease is usually well advanced by the time of diagnosis,
as evidenced by the average presenting tumor size of
f8 cm. ninety percent of patients with atc have
extraglandular spread at the time of diagnosis, and 75%
of the patients will develop distant metastasis during their
disease course (4, 5). because atc is such a lethal disease,
all cases of atc are staged by the american joint
commission on cancer as stage iv, regardless of tumor
size, cervical lymph node status, or metastatic status (6).
the treatment of atc is frequently multimodal, and it
remains controversial whether primary chemotherapy/
radiotherapy results in longer survival than primary
surgical intervention. regardless, it is clear that no effective
therapeutic regimen currently exists for atc. this may be
due in part to the rarity of this disease but largely reflects
the inadequacy of the available treatment options and
suggests an urgent need for development of novel
treatment strategies.
targeted molecular therapy and antiangiogenic therapy
are rapidly becoming accepted as established anticancer
treatment strategies and have shown promising results in
several types of cancer (7). sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor produced by bayer pharmaceutical corp., has both
direct antitumor and antiangiogenic properties (8). these
effects are mediated in part through inhibition of the  xxxg268xxx 
kinase. in addition to the direct antitumor activity of
sorafenib, it has also been shown to have antiangiogenic
properties via the inhibition of vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor-2 ( xxxg1274xxx ) and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor-h ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -h) transmembrane
receptor kinases. the effects of antiangiogenic compounds, such as  xxxd86xxx  and  xxxd3496xxx , on thyroid cancer
have been examined previously by several authors, and
this approach has been suggested to be a valid anticancer
strategy (9 – 11). the antitumor effects of sorafenib have
been studied in a s.c. xenograft model of thyroid cancer.
however, the effects of sorafenib have not been studied
in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. this is an
important issue as the use of an orthotopic model would

1786 antiangiogenic therapy of atc with sorafenib

allow the evaluation of sorafenib against the endothelium
of the thyroid gland.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the
antitumor mechanism of sorafenib using an orthotopic model
of atc in nude mice. in this study, we found that sorafenib
exerts in vitro and in vivo cytostatic effects on thyroid
carcinoma cells. more importantly, we found that administration of sorafenib significantly inhibited the angiogenesis
and growth of orthotopic atc xenografts in nude mice and
significantly improved the survival of the test animals.

materials and methods
animals
male athymic nude mice, ages 8 to 12 weeks, were
purchased from the animal production area of the national
cancer institute-frederick cancer research and development center. the mice were housed and maintained in
laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions in facilities approved by the assessment and
accreditation of laboratory animal care in accordance
with current regulations and standards of the u.s.
department of agriculture, the u.s. department of health
and human services, and the nih. the mice were used in
accordance with the animal care and use guidelines of
the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center
under a protocol approved by the institutional animal
care and use committee.
cell lines and culture conditions
atc cell lines aro, dro,  xxxd2602xxx , hth-74, and k-18 were
used. cell lines aro, dro, and  xxxd2602xxx  carry the brafv600e
mutation, whereas the cell lines hth-74 and k-18 carry wildtype  xxxg268xxx . the cells were grown in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, sodium
pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. adherent monolayer cultures were maintained on plastic and incubated at
37jc in 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air. the cultures were
free of mycoplasma species. the cultures were maintained
no longer than 12 weeks after recovery from frozen stocks.
reagents
sorafenib was generously provided by bayer pharmaceutical. for in vitro administration, sorafenib was dissolved in dmso (sigma-aldrich corp.) to a concentration
of 10 mmol/l and further diluted to appropriate final
concentration in rpmi 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum.
dmso in the final solution did not exceed 0.2% (v/v).
for in vivo testing, sorafenib was dissolved in cremophor
el/ethanol (50:50; sigma cremophor el, 95% ethanol) at
4 concentration. this 4 solution was prepared fresh
every 4 days. final dosing concentration was prepared by
diluting the 4 solution to 1 with sterile water. the
1 solution was prepared just before it was given to the
mice.  xxxd3027xxx  iodide and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide were both purchased
from sigma-aldrich.
effects of sorafenib on proliferation of atc cell lines
to examine the ability of sorafenib to inhibit the
proliferation of atc cell lines in vitro, we used a 3-(4,5-

dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide –
based assay. two thousand cells per well were grown in
rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in
96-well tissue culture plates. after 24 h, the cells were
treated with various concentrations of sorafenib (up to
10 amol/l) in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 2% fetal
bovine serum. because of the concern that the dmso in the
sorafenib preparation could affect the experiments, the
concentration of dmso in all the wells was standardized
and kept below 0.2% (v/v). to measure the number of
metabolically active cells after a 3-day incubation period,
we used a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay measured by a 96-well microtiter plate
reader (mr-5000; dynatech laboratories, inc.) at an
absorbance of 570 nm. these experiments were done at
least in triplicates.
effect of sorafenib on the apoptosis of atc cell
lines
to measure cell death, atc cell lines were plated at a
density of 2  105 per well in 38-mm2 six-well plates
(costar) and maintained for 24 h before treatment with
sorafenib. after 24 h, sorafenib was added in various
concentrations in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 2% fetal
bovine serum. the concentrations of dmso in all the wells
were adjusted to a common concentration that was always
kept below 0.2% (v/v). after 48 h of treatment with
sorafenib, cell death was measured using  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
staining of hypodiploid dna. the treated cells were
resuspended in a nicoletti buffer (50 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% triton x-100) for 20 min
at 4jc. cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry, and
the sub-g0-g1 fraction was measured. these experiments
were done at least in triplicates.
western immunoblotting
to show that sorafenib is able to inhibit the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase(mek) and
mapk in vitro, western immunoblotting was done. dro
cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and
then incubated with sorafenib for 2 h at concentrations
ranging from 0.1 to 15 amol/l before the addition of
 xxxg681xxx  (30 ng/ml) for 15 min. the cells
were then washed with pbs, and lysis buffer was added
[1% triton x-100, 20 mmol/l tris (ph 8.0), 137 mmol/l
 xxxd3213xxx , 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mmol/l edta,
1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mmol/l
aprotinin-leupeptin- xxxd207xxx , 2 mmol/l sodium
orthovanadate]. the cells were scraped and centrifuged to
remove insoluble proteins. the samples were diluted
in sample buffer [10% sds, 0.5 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph
6.8), 1 mol/l dtt, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% bromphenol
blue] and boiled. the proteins (50 ag) were resolved by
page and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. the membranes were blocked with 5%
(w/v) nonfat milk and 0.1% tween 20 (v/v) in tbs
and probed with the following antibodies: rabbit anti –
phosphorylated mek (pmek) antibody (1:2,000; cell
signaling), rabbit anti – phosphorylated mapk (pmapk)

antibody (1:3,000; cell signaling), rabbit anti-mek antibody (1:3,000; cell signaling), and mouse anti-mapk
mouse antibody (1:2,000; cell signaling). goat anti-rabbit
igg antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and
anti-mouse igg antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (amersham life science, inc.) were used (1:3,000) as
the secondary antibodies. protein bands were visualized
using the enhanced chemiluminescence plus western
blotting detection system (amersham life science).
in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic atc xenografts in nude mice
orthotopic xenografts in nude mice were established as
described previously (12). briefly, dro cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures by trypsinization and
washed; 5  105 dro cells in a volume of 5 al were
injected into the right thyroid lobe of each mouse. the
tumors were allowed to develop for the next 4 days. the
mice were then randomized into four groups (12 mice in
each group) that received the following interventions: (a)
untreated group, (b) 250 al of 1 solvent (cremophor el/
ethanol/water; 12.5:12.5:75) via p.o. gavage daily, (c)
sorafenib, 40 mg/kg, via p.o. gavage daily, or (d) sorafenib,
80 mg/kg, via p.o. gavage daily.
the mice were treated for 16 days and weighed twice
weekly. after the treatment period, the mice were killed by
co2 asphyxiation, and necropsy was done. at the time of
necropsy, the tumors were measured in all three dimensions. the volumes of the tumors were calculated using the
formula v = 4 / 3(k)xyz, where x, y, and z represent the
radius of the tumor in each dimension. the percentage
of tumor inhibition was calculated according to the formula
[1
(t / c)]  100, where t and c represent the mean
tumor volumes of the treatment group and the control
group, respectively.
effects of sorafenib on the survival of nude mice
bearing orthotopic atc xenografts
orthotopic atc xenografts were established in nude mice
as described above. four days after the tumor cell injection,
the mice were randomized into four groups (10 mice in each
group): (a) untreated group, (b) placebo group treated
with 250 al of 1 solvent via p.o. gavage daily, (c) sorafenib, 30 mg/kg, via p.o. gavage daily, and (d) sorafenib,
60 mg/kg, via p.o. gavage daily. the mice were weighed
twice weekly and killed if they lost >20% of their body
weight or seemed moribund. the mice were treated for
42 days.
immunohistochemical analysis of murine tumor
tissue sections
immunohistochemical analysis was done with the
following antibodies: rabbit anti-pmek (1:100), mouse
anti –  xxxg1681xxx  (pcna; 1:200;
dakocytomation), rabbit anti – phosphorylated  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -h
(ppdgfr-h; 1:100; santa cruz biotechnology), rabbit anti –
phosphorylated  xxxg1274xxx  (pvegfr-2; tyrosine 1045; santa
cruz biotechnology), and rat anti-mouse  xxxg1724xxx  (1:800;
pharmingen) antibodies; goat anti-rat antibody conjugated
to alexa fluor 594; and goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alexa fluor 448. in addition, terminal deoxynu-

cleotidyl transferase – mediated dutp nick end labeling
(tunel) staining was used to ascertain any intratumoral
apoptosis.
for pcna and pmek staining, paraffin-embedded
sections were first dewaxed in xylene. excess xylene was
removed by washing the slides in ethanol. after treating
the tissue with pepsin for 20 min at 37jc, the slides were
washed with pbs. endogenous blocking was done with 3%
 xxxd2298xxx  followed by protein blocking using 5%
horse serum with 1% goat serum (protein-blocking solution). the primary antibodies were then added for 18 h at
4jc. the slides were then washed with pbs, blocked again
with protein-blocking solution for 1 h, and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase – conjugated antirabbit antibody at
1:200 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. the slides were
washed again in pbs thrice and then incubated with 3,3¶diaminobenzidine for 10 min. after the excess 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine was washed off, counterstaining was done
with gill’s #3 hematoxylin.
to determine the degree of tumor angiogenesis, the
tumor sections were stained for  xxxg1724xxx . frozen tumors were
sectioned (8 – 10 micron thick), mounted on positively
charged superfrost slides (fisher scientific), air dried for
30 min, and fixed in cold acetone for 10 min. the slides
were washed thrice with pbs (ph 7.5), blocked for 20 min
at room temperature in protein-blocking solution, and
incubated with rat anti-mouse  xxxg1724xxx  antibody for 18 h at
4jc. the samples were then washed with pbs and blocked
with protein-blocking solution for 10 min. following the
blocking step, the slides were incubated with goat anti-rat
horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature.
positive staining was then visualized by incubating the
slides in 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine chromogen. after the
excess 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine was washed off, counterstaining was done with gill’s #3 hematoxylin.
for double staining with  xxxg1724xxx -ppdgfr-h, cd31pvegfr-2, and  xxxg1724xxx -tunel, the frozen tumors were
cut and fixed as described above. the slides were blocked
for 20 min at room temperature in protein-blocking
solution and incubated with rat anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibody for
18 h at 4jc. the slides were then washed with pbs, blocked
with protein-blocking solution for 10 min, and incubated
with anti-rat antibody conjugated to alexa fluor 594 for
1 h at room temperature. for  xxxg1724xxx -ppdgfr-h and cd31pvegfr-2 double staining, the slides were then washed in
pbs, blocked with the protein-blocking solution, and
incubated with either anti-ppdgfr-h or anti-pvegfr-2
antibody for 18 h at 4jc. after incubation, the slides were
washed in pbs, blocked with the blocking solution for
10 min, and incubated with alexa fluor 448 – conjugated
antirabbit antibody for 1 h. the slides were then counterstained with 300 ag/ml hoechst stain for 1 to 2 min at
room temperature and mounted using propyl gallate.
for  xxxg1724xxx -tunel double staining, tunel staining was
done on slides already labeled with anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibody, as
described above. tunel staining was done using an apoptosis detection kit (promega) with the following modifications: tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde

(methanol free) for 10 min at room temperature, washed
twice with pbs for 5 min, and then incubated with 0.2%
triton x-100 for 15 min at room temperature. then, the
tissue sections were incubated with reaction buffer containing 44 al equilibration buffer, 5 al nucleotide mix, and 1 al
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase at 37jc for 1 h. the
reaction was terminated by immersing the samples in 2
scc for 15 min. the samples were then washed with pbs to
remove unincorporated fluorescein-dutp and mounted
using propyl gallate.
immunofluorescence microscopy was done using a zeiss
axioplan 2 microscope (carl zeiss) equipped with a 100watt hbo mercury bulb and filter sets (chroma, inc.) to
individually capture red and blue fluorescent images.
images were captured using a c5810 hamamatsu color
chilled three-chip charge-coupled device camera (hamamatsu photonics k.k.) and digitized using optimas
imaging software (media cybernetics). the 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine – stained paraffin sections were examined using a
microphot-fx microscope (nikon) equipped with a threechip charge-coupled device color video camera (model
dxc990; sony corp.).
 xxxg1724xxx  and pcna staining were quantified using computer-assisted image analysis with image pro plus software
(media cybernetics). the image analysis was done on four
random 0.159-mm2 fields (magnification, 100) per slide
from a total of six to seven slides per group. pmek staining
was quantified by counting the number of intensely stained
cells on four random 0.159-mm2 fields (magnification,
100) per slide. the total number of cells was also counted
in each field, and the number of intensely stained cells was
expressed as a percentage of the total cell number. the
photomontages were prepared using photoshop software
(adobe systems, inc.).

results
sorafenib inhibits the in vitro proliferation of atc cell
lines
we first examined the antiproliferative effects of sorafenib
on five atc cell lines, three of which carry the brafv600e
mutation (aro, dro, and  xxxd2602xxx ). the ic50 for inhibition of
proliferation was in the range of 2 to 6 amol/l for all the
atc cell lines examined (fig. 1a). in particular, two atc
cell lines, aro and dro, showed the highest sensitivity to
sorafenib, with the maximal inhibitory effect (f80%)
achieved at 3 amol/l. although three of the atc cell lines
studied carry the brafv600e mutation, we were unable to
establish a definite correlation between the sensitivity of
thyroid carcinoma cell lines to the antiproliferative effects of
sorafenib and the presence of the brafv600e mutation.
sorafenib induces apoptosis of atc cell lines
in vitro
in general, thyroid carcinoma cell lines were not very
sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by sorafenib
(fig. 1b). the atc cell line dro was most sensitive to
the proapoptotic effects of sorafenib at a ic50 of 6 amol/l,
with the maximal effect of 60% apoptosis occurring at a
ic50 of 7.5 amol/l. the other cell lines did not show

again, we did not observe a definite correlation between
the sensitivity of the cell lines to sorafenib and the presence

sorafenib inhibits the phosphorylation of mek and
mapk in vitro in the atc cell line dro
using western blotting techniques, we examined the
ability of sorafenib to inhibit the phosphorylation of kinases
that are downstream of  xxxg268xxx  kinase in the signal transduction pathway (fig. 1c). because the cell line that we selected,
dro, also expresses  xxxg1274xxx , we also examined the ability
of sorafenib to inhibit the autophosphorylation of  xxxg1274xxx .
in this cell line, mapk and mek both showed constitutive
phosphorylation in the absence of stimulation with  xxxg681xxx . however, stimulation with epidermal
growth factor caused a moderate increase in both mek and
mapk phosphorylation. sorafenib was able to inhibit the
phosphorylation of mek, but complete inhibition required
relatively high concentrations (>10 amol/l). the phosphorylation of mapk was even less efficient, with residual
phosphorylation of mapk detectable even after 15 amol/l
sorafenib. however, complete inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx 
autophosphorylation occurred with 5 amol/l sorafenib.
in vivo antitumor activity of sorafenib in orthotopic
atc xenografts
orthotopic atc xenografts were established in athymic
nude mice with the atc cell line dro. after a 16-day

treatment period, the mice were sacrificed and the tumor
volumes were measured. sorafenib significantly inhibited
the growth of orthotopic atc xenografts when used at
both 40 and 80 mg/kg (fig. 2a and b). when compared
with the untreated group, mice treated with 40 and
80 mg/kg sorafenib showed 63% and 93% inhibition of
tumor growth, respectively. these reductions in tumor
volume were statistically significant when compared with
both the untreated and placebo-treated groups (p < 0.05).
sorafenib improves the survival of nude mice bearing orthotopic atc xenografts
nude mice bearing orthotopic atc xenografts were
treated with placebo only, 30 mg/kg sorafenib, or
60 mg/kg sorafenib. the mice in the control group and
the placebo group had a 100% mortality rate by days 21 and
25, respectively (fig. 3). the median survival durations for
the control, placebo, 30 mg/kg, and 60 mg/kg groups were
17, 17, 36, and 40 days, respectively. the differences in
survival between the treatment groups and the control
groups were statistically significant when compared using
the log-rank test (p < 0.001).
sorafenib inhibits the phosphorylation of mek and
cellular proliferation in an orthotopic atc xenograft
to assess the degree of  xxxg268xxx  kinase inhibition by
sorafenib, immunohistochemical staining for pmek was
done in the orthotopic atc xenografts. the difference in
the percentage of pmek-positive cells between the untreated and placebo-treated groups was not statistically
significant. the tumor sections from mice treated with 40
and 80 mg/kg sorafenib showed moderate decreases in the
percentage of pmek-positive cells of f28% and 48%,
respectively (fig. 4a). the tumor sections were also stained
for pcna to ascertain the degree of cellular proliferation.
pcna staining intensity did not differ significantly in the
placebo-treated group and the untreated group. however,
in tumor sections from mice treated with 40 and 80 mg/kg
sorafenib, pcna staining intensity decreased by 39% and

sorafenib inhibits angiogenesis in orthotopic atc
xenografts
immunohistochemical staining for  xxxg1724xxx  was done to
determine the effect of sorafenib on tumor angiogenesis.
treatment with 40 and 80 mg/kg sorafenib resulted in
significant decreases in tumor microvessel density of
f67% and 84%, respectively, compared with the control
group (p < 0.05). furthermore, the microvessels in control
tumors were often dilated and tortuous in their histologic
appearance. the microvasculature of tumors treated with
sorafenib, however, was smaller in caliber, with a statistically significant decrease in the mean microvessel diameter
(p < 0.05; fig. 5a – c).
double staining for  xxxg1724xxx -tunel was done on the tumor
specimens to assess the presence of endothelial apoptosis.

the control and placebo-treated tumors did not show any
endothelial apoptosis. however, treatment with both
40 and 80 mg/kg sorafenib resulted in significant induction
of apoptosis by tumor endothelial cells (fig. 5a). to

endothelial cell – expressed  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -h, double
staining techniques against  xxxg1724xxx -pvegfr-2 and cd31ppdgfr-h were done. tumors from control mice or mice
treated with placebo showed strong colabeling of fluorescent red  xxxg1724xxx  staining specific for endothelial cells, with
fluorescent green staining of pvegfr-2. likewise, colabeling of fluorescent red for endothelial cells with fluorescent
green for ppdgfr-h staining was shown in tumors from
control and placebo-treated mice. in contrast, autophosphorylation of endothelial cell – expressed  xxxg1274xxx  and
 xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -h was significantly suppressed in tumors of mice
treated with sorafenib (fig. 5a).

discussion
in the present study, we studied the in vitro and in vivo
effects of sorafenib on atc. first, sorafenib was shown to
exert a cytostatic effect on atc cell lines in vitro at a
concentration that is within plasma concentration shown in
clinical trials (13). however, we could not show a correlation
between  xxxg268xxx  mutational status and sensitivity to sorafenib. the administration of sorafenib to nude mice bearing
orthotopic atc xenografts resulted in the inhibition of
growth in the tumor xenografts and prolonged the survival
of the test animals. despite the significant growth inhibition,

tumors from mice treated with sorafenib only showed
moderated decrease in the level of pmek. the administration of sorafenib, however, did result in a significant
decrease in the angiogenesis of orthotopic tumor xenografts.
the antitumor effects of specific  xxxg268xxx  inhibition have
been shown previously using rna interference (9).
however, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that
sorafenib may induce its antiproliferative effects via the
inhibition of other targets in addition to  xxxg268xxx  kinase. the
specificity profile of sorafenib shows that it is a multikinase
inhibitor (8), and it has also been shown by carlomagno

1792 antiangiogenic therapy of atc with sorafenib

et al. (14) to inhibit the ret  xxxg2198xxx . the oncologic
importance of ret in the pathogenesis of medullary and
papillary thyroid cancer has been well established. its role
in atc, however, remains to be elucidated, and it is
unclear whether inhibition of ret by sorafenib accounts for
the antitumor activity shown in this study.
the in vivo administration of sorafenib resulted in a significant reduction in the growth of orthotopic xenografts yet
resulted in only a moderate in vivo reduction in  xxxg268xxx  kinase
activity (as assayed by pmek staining). on the other hand,
sorafenib efficiently inhibited the activation of endothelial
cell– expressed  xxxg1274xxx  and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -h tyrosine kinases,
induced significant endothelial apoptosis, and decreased
tumor microvessel density. the magnitude of the antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggests that its overall antitumor
effects may be due to its antiangiogenic properties rather
than its inhibition of the  xxxg268xxx  kinase. taken together, our
data suggest that sorafenib is primarily an antiangiogenic
agent when used in our orthotopic model of thyroid
carcinoma.
it is well established that there is significant variability in
the phenotypes of endothelial cells from various organs
(15). the antitumor effects of sorafenib in thyroid carcinoma have been shown previously by salvatore et al. using a
s.c. xenograft model (9). however, that study did not
examine the effects of sorafenib on tumor angiogenesis,
perhaps owing to the possibility that the endothelia of the
subcutis and the thyroid gland may differ in their
susceptibility to various antiangiogenic compounds. the
significant antiangiogenic response induced by sorafenib in
our orthotopic model suggests that the endothelium of the
thyroid gland is highly susceptible to this compound. if
sorafenib is to be considered primarily an antiangiogenic
agent when used against thyroid carcinomas, then its
indication for use may not depend on the  xxxg268xxx  mutational
status of these tumors.
in our in vivo study, an atc cell line carrying the
brafv600e mutation was used to establish the orthotopic
xenografts in nude mice. we did not examine the
effectiveness of sorafenib against xenografts carrying
wild-type  xxxg268xxx , as these atc cell lines show low
tumorigenicity in nude mice. however, our in vitro observations suggest that the antiproliferative effects of sorafenib do not correlate with  xxxg268xxx  mutational status. the
predominantly antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib also
make it likely that this compound will be effective against
thyroid carcinomas regardless of the  xxxg268xxx  mutational
status. last, we used relatively high doses of sorafenib in
this study to provide proof of principal that sorafenib can
be an effective  xxxg482xxx . it is likely that the
magnitude of antitumor and antiangiogenic effects observed in this study may not be replicated in clinical
settings. therefore, these observations should be taken into
consideration in the application of our data to any future
clinical studies.
several clinical trials are in progress with sorafenib
against various tumor types, including melanoma, renal
cell carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma (16 – 20). in

contrast to the multitude of clinical trials of sorafenib
against various solid tumors, interest in clinical trials
pertaining to atc remains low. patients with atc,
however, have few therapeutic options, with most of these
being palliative. the data presented in this study suggest
that sorafenib is a valid therapeutic agent in the treatment
of atc that warrants further investigation.
