abstract: mouse  xxxg2204xxx  (msr) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes
the biosynthesis of the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor coagonist  xxxd5xxx  in the brain. furthermore, msr
catalyzes beta-elimination of serine and l-serine-o-sulfate into pyruvate. the biological significance of this
beta-elimination activity and the factors influencing msr substrate and reaction specificity, which are crucial
for prospective inhibitor design, are poorly understood. using a bacterial expression system and atpagarose affinity chromatography, we have generated a pure and active recombinant msr and investigated
its substrate and reaction specificity in vitro by analyzing a systematic series of compounds derived from
 xxxd3193xxx  and l-serine-o-sulfate. the analysis revealed several competitive inhibitors of serine racemization
including glycine (ki ) 1.63 mm), several dicarboxylic acids including malonate (ki ) 0.077 mm), and
l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate (ki ) 0.049 mm). the latter compound represents the most effective inhibitor
of sr reported to date. a simple inversion of the beta-carbon configuration of the compound yields an
excellent beta-elimination substrate l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate. inhibition analysis indicates that racemization
and beta-elimination activities of msr reside at the same active site. while the racemization activity is
specific to serine, the beta-elimination activity has a broader specificity for l-amino acids with a suitable
leaving group at the beta-carbon and optimal spatial orientation of the r-carboxyl and leaving groups. the
possible implications of our observations for inhibitor design, regulation of activity, and function of msr
are discussed.

all known living organisms use l-amino acids as building
blocks for ribosomal proteosynthesis. while d-amino acids
occur commonly in bacteria, which synthesize and use them,
for example, during cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis,
they were considered not to have a role in higher organisms.
however, research during the past decade has consistently
revealed significant levels of  xxxd5xxx  in mouse and rat brains
(1, 2), and  xxxd5xxx  has been found to act as a coagonist at
the “glycine site” of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)1
subtype of l-glutamate receptors occurring in the mammalian
central nervous system (cns) (3-5). nmda receptor
signaling is crucial for many physiological processes in
mammals including brain development, learning, and memory

(6-8). overactivation of nmda receptors leads to neuronal
death and contributes to postischemic brain damage and
neuropathologies. importantly, pharmacological blockers of
the glycine site are protective in animal models of stroke
(7).  xxxd5xxx  and glycine bind to the regulatory glycine site
of nmda receptors with similar affinity, and their relative
importance for physiological coactivation of nmda receptors is still a matter of debate (reviewed in refs 6 and 7).
glycine is present in high intracellular concentration in all
cells, and its extracellular concentrations in mammalian cns
are buffered by several specific transporters.  xxxd5xxx  cns
levels are particularly high before and shortly after birth and
decline in adulthood (9). it is possible that both  xxxd5xxx  and
gly are physiologically relevant for coactivation of nmda
receptors with a distinct spatiotemporal pattern.
the origin of  xxxd5xxx  in mammals was unclear until serine
racemase, which catalyzes direct conversion of  xxxd3193xxx  to
 xxxd5xxx , was isolated from rat brain (10). its orthologues
displaying similar enzymatic properties were also found in
mouse and human (11, 12), and it has been suggested to be
responsible for  xxxd5xxx  biosynthesis in vivo. mouse serine
racemase (msr) is a unique pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp)
enzyme whose activity is dependent on divalent cations and
stimulated by atp and, to a lesser extent, by adp, gtp,
and other nucleoside triphosphates (13, 14). it forms dimers

and tetramers in solution with a monomer molecular mass
of about 37 kda (15, 16). we and others previously observed
that msr not only racemizes serine but it also converts
l-serine and l-serine-o-sulfate into pyruvate via its beta-elimination activity (13, 14, 16). the l-serine-o-sulfate beta-elimination activity of msr is about 2 orders of magnitude higher
than both its serine racemization and beta-elimination activities
(17). however, the factors regulating the reaction specificity
of msr and the physiological significance of its beta-elimination activity in vivo remain poorly understood.
in this work we aim to analyze substrate and reaction
specificity of msr and to define the structural features
important for the high-affinity binding of a ligand to serine
racemase. to this end, we developed a prokaryotic expression
system for msr, employed a novel application of cofactor
affinity chromatography, and, using thereby highly purified
and active recombinant enzyme, carried out inhibition
analysis of a series of systematically varied l-serine and
l-serine o-sulfate derivatives. among these, we identified
several competitive inhibitors and several beta-elimination
substrates.
materials and methods
dna cloning and protein expression. our escherichia
coli expression system for msr employs the arabinoseinducible pmpm vector series (18). due to the presence of
both ncoi and ecori sites within the msr coding sequence,
these sites could not be used for cloning of the 5′-end of
msr into pmpm-a4. therefore, the ncoi site in pmpma4 was mutated to ndei by pcr mutagenesis. the pmpma4 vector omega-interposon part was amplified using
oligonucleotide primers 5′-gtgaaaggaggaattccatatggctctagagctttatgc-3′ and 5′-cgttctgatttaatctgtatcaggc-3′ and back-inserted into
pmpm-a4 via ecori and xhoi restriction sites to yield
pmpm-a4-2. the mouse  xxxg2204xxx  gene [genbank
nucleotide accession number af148321 (12)] was pcramplified using oligonucleotides 5′-gacccacatatgtgtgctcagtactgcatc-3′ and 5′-tccccgcggctcgagttattaaacagaaaccgtctggta-3′ and inserted
into pmpm-a4-2 via ndei and xhoi restriction sites to yield
the expression construct pks-msr. the dna sequence of
the insert was verified by automated dna sequencing using
bigdye3.0 (amersham).
recombinant msr was expressed in e. coli mc1061 (19)
using nutrient-rich turbo medium (athena enzyme systems,
baltimore, md). briefly, calcium chloride competent bacteria
were transformed by pks-msr, plated onto lb agar plates
containing ampicilin (100 µg/ml), and incubated at 37 °c
for 18 h. the resulting colonies were washed off the plates
and inoculated into the prewarmed growth medium containing ampicilin (100 µg/ml) to an od600 of ∼0.05. cultures
were grown at 37 °c, 300 rpm, in an orbital shaker (new
brunswick scientific). intensive aeration of the culture during
the expression experiment was required for high msr
expression. when the culture density reached od600 ) 0.8,
msr expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm
l-arabinose (sigma). after 5 h of induction bacteria were
harvested by centrifugation (10000g, 10 min, 4 °c) and
stored at -70 °c.

pellets of induced bacteria were suspended in qa buffer [20

homogenizer at 3 ml/g of cell paste, supplemented with 1
mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and the complete
edta-free protease inhibitor mix (roche molecular biochemicals), and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml chicken egg
lysozyme and 0.05% (w/v) sodium  xxxd1835xxx  for 30 min
at room temperature. after the addition of 10 mm mgcl2
and dnase i (roche molecular biochemicals) to 10 µg/ml
and 30 min incubation at room temperature, the cell
suspension was sonicated on ice 3 × 20 s with 20 s intervals
between cycles. the resulting crude lysate was centrifuged
at 20000g for 30 min at 4 °c. the supernatant was loaded
onto a phenyl-sepharose fastflow (pharmacia) column
preequilibrated in qa buffer. after being washed with three
column volumes of qa buffer, msr was eluted with 50%
(v/v) ethylene glycol in qa buffer, ph 7.0. the eluate was
immediately diluted with an equal volume of qa buffer and
applied to a q-sepharose fastflow (pharmacia) column
preequilibrated in qa buffer. after being washed with five
column volumes of qa buffer, msr was eluted in a linear
salt gradient generated by qb buffer [20 mm triethanolamine
hydrochloride-naoh, ph 7.0, 0.5 m nacl, 1 mm mgcl2,
20 µm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 0.1 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and
0.02% (w/v) nan3] at approximately 220-320 mm sodium
chloride. the msr-containing fractions (whose intensively
yellow color is an indication of bound pyridoxal 5′phosphate) were concentrated 10-fold using centriprep
concentrators (millipore), diluted with qa buffer, reconcentrated 10-fold, and applied to the atp-agarose (sigma)
column preequilibrated in qa buffer. the bound msr was
eluted by 2 column volumes of 2 mm atp in qa buffer,
concentrated to approximately 0.5 mg/ml as determined by
the bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad laboratories gmbh,
munich, germany), dialyzed three times against 200 volumes
of qa buffer at 4 °c, and stored at -70 °c. concentration
of pure msr was determined by quantitative amino acid
analysis. the enzyme sample was hydrolyzed for 20 h in
vacuo with 6 m hcl containing 3% phenol, dried, and
analyzed using a biochrom 20 amino acid analyzer (pharmacia biotech) with ninhydrin detection of eluted amino
acids.
activity assays. enzymatic activities of msr were analyzed in a ph 8.0 reaction buffer containing 100 mm
hepes-naoh, 10 µm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 1 mm
mgcl2, 5 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 1 mm atp. reactions
typically proceeded for 30 min at 37 °c. as msr is unstable
below ph 5 and easily precipitates (unpublished observations), the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 µl
of 1.875 m hclo4 to 100 µl of the reaction mixture. after
centrifugation (15000g, 10 min, room temperature), the
solution was neutralized by the addition of 20 µl of 1.875
m koh and incubated on ice for 10 min, and the kclo4
precipitate was separated by centrifugation. for analysis of
amino acid racemization, 10 µl of 5 mm glycine was added
as an internal standard to the neutralized supernatant, and
the amino acid mixture was derivatized by 1-fluoro-2,4dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide [marfey’s reagent (20, 21)]
and resolved using reversed-phase hplc as described (16).
formation of 2-oxo acids was determined either by
spectrophotometric assay of nadh depletion accompanying

substrate specificity of  xxxg2204xxx 
their reduction to 2-hydroxy acids by lactate dehydrogenase
and nadh (14) or by derivatization of reaction mixtures
with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (13). the derivatization of
50 µl of the reaction mixture by 50 µl of the dinitrophenylhydrazine solution was performed in the presence of 900
µl of 50% (v/v) methanol at room temperature for 10 min.
dinitrophenylhydrazones of r-oxo acids were resolved using
reversed-phase hplc on zorbax extend c18 (agilent
technologies) in a gradient of 40-85% methanol in 50 mm
tetrabutylammonium hydroxide adjusted to ph 4.3 by
ultrapure acetic acid and detected by uv absorption at 366
nm (22). in this system, 2-oxo acids yielded stable patterns
of more derivatives, and their quantification was based on
the sum of the resulting peaks.
enzyme kinetics. the steady-state initial velocities of
enzyme reactions were determined by end point measurement
of product. the dependence of initial velocities on initial
substrate concentration was fitted into the michaelis-menten
equation by nonlinear regression using grafit program,
version 5 (erithacus software ltd., surrey, u.k.).
computational details. all calculations were carried out
with turbomole 5.6 software (23). the geometry optimizations were performed using a density-functional (dft) (24,
25), tzvp basis set (26). the calculations were expedited
by the resolution-of-identity (ri-j) approximation (27, 28)
and carried out in a dielectric continuum ( ) 80, i.e.,
representing water), using the conductor-like screening model
(cosmo) (29-31).
results
preparation of recombinant msr: atp affinity chromatography. to study substrate specificity and inhibition of
mouse  xxxg2204xxx  (msr), we have constructed an e.
coli expression system using arabinose-inducible expression
vector pmpm_a4omega (18). recombinant msr was expressed
in e. coli as described in materials and methods. after cell
lysis, msr was isolated from the soluble fraction of the cell
lysate using hydrophobic and anion-exchange chromatography to yield an msr-enriched fraction (figure 1a, lane
qs). this preparation was purified to homogeneity using
atp affinity chromatography that we developed on the basis
of the observation that atp binds and activates msr with a
half-maximal activatory concentration ([mgatp]0.5) of 3-4
µm without being hydrolyzed (13, 14). we tested msr
binding to three commercially available atp-agarose supports, which differ in the site of attachment of the atp
moiety to the agarose support. the c8-linked atp-agarose
(figure 1b) was by far most efficient, followed by the n6linked one, whereas the 2′,3′-oh-linked atp-agarose did
not bind msr at all (data not shown). the binding of msr
to the c8-linked atp-agarose was inhibited by 0.5 m nacl,
and it was therefore essential for the efficiency of the atp
affinity chromatography to keep the ionic strength below 100
mm. specific elution of msr from the affinity column was
achieved by elution with 2 mm atp. thereby, purified msr
was homogeneous on an overloaded sds-page (figure
1a, lane aa). the overall yield was about 2 mg of pure
msr/l of bacterial culture.
automated n-terminal edman degradation analysis revealed that met1 and cys2 were removed from the recombinant msr by e. coli enzymes, presumably by methionine

aminopeptidase, which has been shown to effectively remove
the second amino acid after the initiator methionine if the
third amino acid is small (gly, ala, ser) (32). maldi mass
spectrometry of dialyzed pure msr yielded a single molecular mass peak at 36121.2 da. this value corresponds well
to the predicted molecular mass of the ala3 to val339 fragment
of msr, 36123.6 da, showing that no c-terminal proteolytic
cleavage took place in e. coli. aggregation state analysis
by gel permeation chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that the enzyme forms dimers and
tetramers in solution (data not shown), as found previously
for both the native msr (13) and a recombinant msr from
different expression systems (15). the minor n-terminal
trimming of our recombinant msr thus did not significantly
affect its oligomerization properties.
kinetic characterization of the recombinant msr. to
compare the enzymatic properties of our purified recombinant
msr to those of the native enzyme and recombinant enzymes
produced in other systems, we analyzed its enzymatic activity
using the previously described substrates  xxxd3193xxx ,  xxxd5xxx , and
 xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate (11, 17). the analysis was carried out under
1 mm mgatp, which might best reflect the in vivo
conditions in glial cells (33), and at ph 8.0. the pure
recombinant msr was stable following at least four freeze-

and 1 mm mgatp at 37 °c as described under materials and methods.
the kinetic parameters of known msr substrates undergoing racemization or beta-elimination were determined by nonlinear regression fitting
of initial reaction rates into the michaelis-menten equation. values
are represented as the mean ( sem.

thaw cycles, and it preserved full activity during 5 h
incubation in the assay buffer at 37 °c (data not shown).
on the basis of these observations and the application of a
bioaffinity purification step, we assumed that the purified
msr preparation contained only active species, and we
considered its analytical concentration as determined by
amino acid analysis identical to the concentration of active
msr needed for kcat calculation. a representative michaelismenten kinetics hyperbolic plot showing dependence of the
initial reaction rates of  xxxd3193xxx  racemization on the initial  xxxd3193xxx 
concentration is depicted in figure 1c. likewise, we have
determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for racemization and beta-elimination of  xxxd3193xxx ,  xxxd5xxx , and  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate
(table 1). racemization was assayed by chemical modification of the reaction mixture by n-r-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-l-alanine amide (marfey’s reagent) and hplc separation
of the resulting diastereoisomers. pyruvate concentration was
determined either by spectrophotometric assay of nadh
depletion accompanying the reduction of pyruvate to lactate
by lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and nadh ( xxxd3193xxx -osulfate,  xxxd3193xxx ) or by dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization
and hplc analysis ( xxxd5xxx ,  xxxd3193xxx ).
it is evident that  xxxd3193xxx  displays nearly equal km values
for both racemization and beta-elimination. in contrast, the km
values for  xxxd5xxx  racemization and beta-elimination are significantly different, and the kcat of  xxxd5xxx  beta-elimination is an order
of magnitude lower than that of its racemization. in
particular, the km value of  xxxd5xxx  beta-elimination is comparable
to the km values for  xxxd3193xxx  racemization and beta-elimination,
while the km value for  xxxd5xxx  racemization is about four times
higher. while  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate is effectively beta-eliminated by
msr, its racemization was not observed. the substrate
selectivity constant (kcat/km) for  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate beta-elimination
is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of any
reaction involving serine, and the apparent affinity of l-sero-sulfate for the enzyme (km) is 1 order of magnitude higher
than that of serine. therefore, we asked which substrate
features are responsible for its high affinity for the enzyme
active site, which substrate features determine the reaction
specificity of msr, and whether the racemization and
beta-elimination activites reside in a single active site or separate
active sites within msr oligomers.
specificity mapping of active site ligand binding to msr.
to analyze the substrate and reaction specificity of serine
racemase, we studied a panel of systematically modified
compounds derived from the two known substrates,  xxxd3193xxx 
and  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate, and quantified their ability to interfere
with  xxxd3193xxx  racemization. the structures of selected com-

were 5 mm. group i is comprised of serine derivatives, group ii
includes derivatives and analogues of  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate, and group
iii represents variations of the group ii skeleton devoid of the
r-amino group. the compounds found to act as msr substrates or
competitive inhibitors are denoted s and ci, respectively.

pounds were grouped into three subsets. group i compounds
can be described as  xxxd3193xxx  derivatives in which individual
functional groups such as -oh, -ch2-oh, -cooh, and
-nh2 were removed or replaced to yield different derivatives. likewise, group ii compounds represent  xxxd3193xxx -osulfate derivatives with the -oso3h group replaced by its
structural analogues. finally, group iii compounds represent
structural and configurational variations of the group ii
skeleton devoid of the r-amino group.
all compounds were first prescreened for inhibition of
 xxxd3193xxx  racemization, as we assumed that those interacting with
the active site of msr, whether inhibitors or substrates, will
inhibit  xxxd3193xxx  racemization in proportion to the magnitude of
their binding affinity. the tested compounds and  xxxd3193xxx  were
equimolar at 5 mm, which is slightly higher than the km of
 xxxd3193xxx  (3.8 mm in the conditions used, table 1). in this setup,
the assay is sensitive to inhibitors with an affinity comparable
to or better than that of  xxxd3193xxx . the primary results of the
ligand prescreening are summarized in figure 2.
a few compounds (acetate, ethanolamine, and  xxxd5xxx -ophosphate) activated msr by 10-15%, but this effect was
considered weak and was not analyzed further. the compounds that inhibited  xxxd3193xxx  racemization by a factor of 3 or
more relative to the control, which would correspond to a
ki of ∼1-2 mm in the case of competitive inhibition (as
estimated from the experimental setup, kinetic parameters
of  xxxd3193xxx  racemization, and a competitive inhibition model),
were further analyzed for their inhibition mechanism and
inhibitory constants.
using lineweaver-burk analysis, glycine (figure 3a),
 xxxd1788xxx -s-sulfate, l- xxxd231xxx  xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate
(figure 3a), meso-tartrate, dihydroxyfumarate, maleate, and
malonate were found to be competitive inhibitors of  xxxd3193xxx 
racemization (denoted ci in figure 2), and their ki values
are summarized in table 2.

figure 3: compounds inhibiting  xxxd3193xxx  racemization by a factor of 3 or more relative to the control were analyzed by for their mode of
inhibition and their inhibitory constants. (a) the lineweaver-burk plot for glycine and l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate is shown as an
example. (b) the steady-state kinetic parameters of the compounds acting as msr substrates were determined by nonlinear regression from
hyperbolic plots. a representative plot for l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate is shown. kinetic constants are summarized in table 3. (c)  xxxd3193xxx 
racemization and elimination occur at the same active site. the eadie-hofstee plot shows that l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate is a competitive
inhibitor of  xxxd3193xxx  elimination. measurements were carried out at ph 8.0, 10 µm plp, 1 mm mgatp, and 5 mm dtt.

other inhibiting compounds shown in figure 2 are
expected to be weaker but competitive as well because they
are all structurally similar to the competitive inhibitors listed
in table 2. some of the interacting compounds shown in
figure 2 are in fact substrates of the enzyme. their inhibitory
activities are only indicative and cannot be directly compared
since the compounds are being eliminated during the analysis
and their concentration does not remain constant. the kinetic
constants of those compounds are summarized in table 3
(see below).
a minimal ligand: glycine is a competitive inhibitor of
msr. the analysis of  xxxd3193xxx  derivatives (group i compounds,
figure 2) shows that the replacement of the hydroxyl group
from the beta-carbon of  xxxd3193xxx  by the electronegative -cl atom
preserves binding to msr, but only in the case of the
l-isomer. its replacement by a less electronegative and less
polar -sh group to yield  xxxd1788xxx  diminishes the affinity of
the compound to msr.  xxxd1788xxx  does not interact with msr
under these conditions. furthermore, when the beta-hydroxyl
group of  xxxd3193xxx  is removed to yield  xxxd2428xxx , the inhibition of
msr is virtually lost. however, removal of the beta-carbon of
the inert  xxxd2428xxx  results in competitively inhibiting gly with
a ki value of 1.64 mm (table 2). the removal of the
r-amino group of glycine, its replacement by a hydroxyl,
or removal of its carboxyl group prevents binding of the
resulting acetate,  xxxd2219xxx , and ethanolamine, respectively,
whereas replacement of the r-amino group by an oxo group,
as in glyoxylate, preserves some binding. it is intriguing that

the smallest and ubiquitous amino acid glycine binds msr
with such a relatively high affinity. assuming that substrate
binding to a plp-dependent enzyme is faster than any
subsequent catalytic steps (34), we can approximate the  xxxd3193xxx 
substrate dissociation constant ks by its michaelis constant
km (35, 36). under this assumption, glycine would have
about 2.4-fold higher affinity for msr than  xxxd3193xxx .
l- xxxd2033xxx - and l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartates: a highaffinity msr inhibitor and an efficient substrate differing
in a single carbon configuration. for group ii, all substitutions to the terminal -o-so3h group of  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate
decrease the inhibitory properties of the compounds (figure
2), and the d-isomers of the studied  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate analogues
do not inhibit  xxxd3193xxx  racemization under these conditions at
all. the cysteine analogues of  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate,  xxxd1788xxx -ssulfate and its derivatives l-cysteinesulfinate and l-homocysteate, are stronger inhibitors of msr than those l-sero-sulfate derivatives in which the whole terminal sulfo group
is substituted by a phospho, acetyl, or a carboxymethyl group
to yield  xxxd3193xxx -o-phosphate,  xxxd3193xxx -o-acetate, and  xxxd2431xxx ,
respectively. interestingly,  xxxd1788xxx -s-sulfate is not a substrate
for elimination by msr.
although  xxxd2431xxx  inhibits msr weakly, its one methylene
shorter analogues,  xxxd233xxx  and  xxxd231xxx , are significantly stronger
inhibitors.
the addition of a beta-hydroxyl group to  xxxd233xxx  (to partially
mimic the natural substrate  xxxd3193xxx ) yields hydroxyaspartate,
a molecule with two chiral centers and four diastereoisomers.

more relative to control (figure 2) were subjected to lineweaverburk plot analysis, and all were found to be competitive. measurements

while l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (2s,3s) inhibits  xxxd3193xxx 
racemization moderately and d-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate
(2r,3r) shows no significant synergistic effect in our assay
(figure 2), the l- xxxd2033xxx  isomer of 3-hydroxyaspartate
(2s,3r) is the strongest competitive inhibitor of  xxxd3193xxx 
racemization among all analyzed compounds (ki ) 0.049
mm, figure 3a and table 2) and the strongest competitive
inhibitor of msr described so far. its affinity to msr is
approximately 30 times higher than that of glycine and about
80 times higher than the affinity of the natural substrate  xxxd3193xxx 
(compare tables 2 and 1). the fact that l- xxxd2033xxx -3hydroxyaspartate is a stereoisomer of an efficient beta-elimination substrate and it is a competitive inhibitor of both  xxxd3193xxx 
racemization and elimination (figure 3c) suggests that the
racemization and beta-elimination occur at the same active site.
msr is competitively inhibited by three- and fourcarbon dicarboxylates. to explore in detail the conformational requirements of a dicarboxylate ligand for binding to
msr, we analyzed a systematic series of dicarboxylic acids
for their ability to inhibit msr (figure 2, group iii). these
compounds lack the r-amino group and as such are not

střı́šovský et al.
substrates of msr in racemization or beta-elimination reactions.
it seems that if hydroxyl substituents are present at carbons
2 and 3, the (r,s) isomer of the compound exhibits the
highest affinity for msr. this is documented by the three
isomers of tartaric acid. while l-tartrate (r,r), which is
isosteric with d-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate, virtually does not
inhibit msr, d-tartrate (s,s), an isostere of l-threo-3hydroxyaspartate, is a medium-strength inhibitor in our assay
(figure 2) and meso-tartrate (r,s), which sterically corresponds to  xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate, is the highest affinity
inhibitor of the tartrate series (ki ) 0.66 mm; see table 2).
dihydroxyfumarate, which exists in aqueous solution as
2(rs)-hydroxy-3-oxo- xxxd3251xxx  and is stereochemically related to meso-tartrate, shows strong competitive
inhibition (ki ) 0.69 mm). it must be mentioned that the
replacement of the r-amino group in l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate (ki ) 0.049 mm) by an isosteric hydroxyl, as
occurs in meso-tartrate, reduces the affinity for msr by an
order of magnitude (ki ) 0.66 mm). the presence of only
a single hydroxy or amino substituent at carbon 2 does not
seem to improve binding to the active site of msr, since
succinate inhibits msr to the same extent as l-malate and
oxalacetate and even more potently than d-malate,  xxxd231xxx ,
or  xxxd233xxx  (figure 2).
next, we analyzed a series of conformationally restricted
dicarboxylates. interestingly, while fumarate (trans-butenedioic acid) is a very weak inihibitor of msr, maleate (cisbutenedioic acid) is a strong competitive inhibitor (ki ) 0.55
mm) and malonate ( xxxd2537xxx ) has an even higher
affinity than maleate (ki ) 0.071 mm). the fact that oxalate
inhibits msr even more weakly than fumarate demonstrates
that although chelation of  xxxd2531xxx  by dicarboxylates
might contribute to msr inhibition, it is definitely not the
main factor, since oxalate, the strongest chelator (36), is the
least efficient inhibitor of the series. we propose that the
mutual spatial orientation of the two carboxyl groups in a
dicarboxylate contributes more to msr binding affinity than
do the functional amino and hydroxy groups at the carbon
backbone of the compound.
msr beta-elimination activity is specific to l-amino acids
with an electronegative beta-carbon substituent. while several
compounds from the analyzed set were found to be competitive inhibitors of  xxxd3193xxx  racemization, only the compounds
having an r-amino group in the l-configuration and a
suitable leaving group at their beta-carbon could act as msr
substrates (figure 2). whereas beta-cl- xxxd2428xxx ,  xxxd3361xxx , and
l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate are efficiently beta-eliminated to
pyruvate, 2- xxxd64xxx , and oxalacetate, respectively (see
table 3), only threonine undergoes epimerization ( xxxd3361xxx  to
d-allo-thr and d-thr to l-allo-thr). however, the initial rates
of  xxxd3361xxx  racemization are less than 10% of those of its
beta-elimination, which prohibits accurate determination of
steady-state kinetic parameters of the former process. the
d-isomers of the studied amino acids were not converted to
the corresponding 2-oxo acids at a measurable rate with the
exception of  xxxd5xxx .
comparison of the kinetic parameters for beta-elimination
of beta-cl- xxxd2428xxx ,  xxxd3361xxx , and l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (table
3) with those of the  xxxd3193xxx  and  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate beta-elimination
reactions (table 1) suggests that the kcat of the beta-elimination
reaction increases in proportion to the stability of the anion
that is released from the beta-carbon and the electrophilicity

of the beta-carbon (kcat for  xxxd3193xxx  < beta-cl- xxxd2428xxx  <  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate
< l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate). this correlation between kcat
values and beta-carbon electrophilicity/leaving group stability
might reflect the thermodynamics of the catalyzed chemical
reaction. the specificity of the enzyme reaction is further
influenced by the proper alignment of the substrate carbon
backbone with the enzyme active site (compare kcat for  xxxd3193xxx 
<  xxxd3361xxx  < l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate in table 3). l-threo3-hydroxyaspartate conversion to oxalacetate has the highest
kcat of all substrates analyzed: about 23 times higher than
that of  xxxd3193xxx  to pyruvate and two times higher than that of
 xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate to pyruvate elimination. interestingly, a
simple switch of the beta-hydroxyl configuration in l-3hydroxyaspartate transforms the beta-elimination substrate
l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate into l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate, the strongest competitive inhibitor described to date.
qualitative structural characteristics of msr ligands. to
explore the stereochemical relationships between the individual msr ligands, we used quantum chemical calculations
to obtain equilibrium geometries for the series of conformationally restricted dicarboxylates (figure 4) as well as for
msr substrates l- xxxd3193xxx serine-o-sulfate, l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate, and  xxxd3361xxx  and the inhibitor l-erythro3-hydroxyaspartate (figure 5). all of the reported optimized

structures correspond to the protonation states at ph 7, i.e.,
carboxylates deprotonated and amino group protonated
(nh3+). the equilibrium geometries correspond to an aqueous environment, as they were optimized in the dielectric
cavity with r ) 80, which is a necessary prerequisite for
obtaining the stable zwitterionic forms [such structures tend
to neutralize in in vacuo calculations, forming (nh2, cooh)
tautomers]. although the minimized structures reflect the
lowest energy conformations of free compounds in water
and do not take into account the interaction with the enzyme,
some valid observations can be made.
from the structural analysis of the studied conformationally restricted dicarboxylates, it is evident that for efficient
binding to msr the optimal distance between carboxyl
carbons is represented by malonate (2.60 å) and maleate
(3.16 å) (compare table 2 and figure 4). other dicarboxylates can adopt their conformation accordingly, e.g., succinate
(compare figure 2), but it will always be at certain energetic
cost unless the molecule is inherently structurally constrained
in a favorable way, as is the case of maleate and malonate.
a high degree of similarity between l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (2s,3s) and  xxxd3361xxx  (2s,3r) can be seen in
the equilibrium conformations of msr substrates (figure 5).
except for the presence of a carboxylate group in l-threo3-hydroxyaspartate, the structures are virtually identical,
which can explain why they are both msr substrates.
however, the presence of the second carboxylate in l-threo3-hydroxyaspartate (in place of a methyl group in  xxxd3361xxx )
probably ensures a higher affinity for msr (compare km’s
in table 2). interestingly, the equilibrium conformation of
the inhibitor l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate (2s,3r) significantly differs from that of its threo isomer. in the former,
both of its carboxylates participate in two strong hydrogen
bonds: one interacts with the oh group and the other with
the nh3+ group. in contrast to l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate
(2s,3s), all three atoms (x-h‚‚‚y) in the two strong
intramolecular hydrogen bonds of l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate (2s,3r) are in their optimal positions. as a
consequence, it is thermodynamically more stable by 33 kj/
mol and has more restricted conformational flexibility (or
higher rigidity) than the substrate, l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate
(2s,3s). the lower thermochemical stability of l-threo-3hydroxyaspartate (2s,3s) can be considered as a favorable

13098 biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 39, 2005
factor for the beta-elimination reaction. since beta-elimination of
both isomers would result in optically inactive compounds,
the excess internal energy of approximately 30 kj/mol in
favor of (2s,3s) isomers can be used as the driving force
for the enzymatic reaction.
discussion
recent findings suggest that mouse  xxxg2204xxx  is a
bifunctional enzyme that produces both  xxxd5xxx  and pyruvate
from  xxxd3193xxx  in vivo, the latter activity being higher than the
former (13, 14, 16, 33). the biological significance of this
phenomenon and its relevance for the physiological role of
msr are unclear. to obtain a better insight into msr
catalysis and its regulation, we generated recombinant mouse
 xxxg2204xxx  of high purity and specific activity and
investigated in detail its substrate and reaction specificity in
vitro.
while the km value for  xxxd3193xxx  racemization of our
recombinant msr corresponds well to values obtained by
other researchers using recombinant msr from different
sources, its kcat value is about 20-fold higher than for purified
recombinant msr produced in bacteria or mammalian cells
(33). this difference could be attributed partly to application
of our newly developed atp affinity chromatography that
enriched the msr preparation in the species of native fold
and intact atp binding site and partly to different assay
conditions used in the study of foltyn et al. (33), which was
carried out in the absence of reducing agents and at neutral
ph. in those conditions msr is much less active than at ph
8.0 and in the presence of sh-reducing agents, the environment in which our measurements were conducted (10, 13,
16). furthermore, since msr activity is stimulated by atp
(13, 14), we conducted all of our kinetic experiments in the
presence of saturating concentrations of mgatp, as this may
closely resemble physiological conditions (33).
the substrate and inhibitor specificity analysis in this
report shows that glycine, which lacks any side chain, is a
competitive inhibitor of msr with approximately 2-fold
higher affinity to msr than the natural substrate l-serine
(tables 1 and 2). furthermore, several dicarboxylates, which
lack an r-amino group, are even stronger competitive
inhibitors than glycine itself. both findings are consistent
with a recent report of dunlop and neidle (38), who found
that glycine,  xxxd233xxx ,  xxxd231xxx , and oxalacetate
competitively inhibit  xxxd3193xxx  racemization by native msr
isolated from mouse brain. our work extends these observations by showing that oxalacetate is the product of l-threo3-hydroxyaspartate beta-elimination and that three- to fourcarbon dicarboxylates are moderate to strong msr ligands,
depending on the spatial distance of the two carboxyl groups
and their conformational flexibility (figure 2, table 2). in
previous work by others, the inhibition of msr by glycine,
 xxxd233xxx , and asparagine was not observed, while strong
inhibition by l-lysine and cysteine was reported (15, 17). in
contrast, we reproducibly observed only weak inhibition by
l-cysteine (figure 2) and no inhibition by l-lysine (not
shown), which is, however, consistent with recent reports
using native msr isolated from brain (13, 38). glycine
inhibition might be important for msr activity regulation
in vivo since glycine is found in astrocytes at relatively high
concentrations of about 3-6 mm (39, 40), which would be

střı́šovský et al.
sufficient to significantly inhibit  xxxg2204xxx  activity. a
possible solution to this apparent incongruity would be that
 xxxg2204xxx  and glycine show different compartmentation
within the astrocyte cytosol.
our analyses suggest that the beta-elimination activity of
msr is specific to l-amino acids containing an electronegative substituent at the beta-carbon and that it is always higher
than the racemization activity toward a given substrate.
whereas we observe efficient beta-elimination of  xxxd3193xxx , beta-cll-ala,  xxxd3361xxx ,  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate, and l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate, the d-isomers of these amino acids were not beta-eliminated with the exception of  xxxd5xxx . however, its beta-elimination
is 7.5-fold less efficient than that of  xxxd3193xxx  (kcat/km, table
1), and it is the only d-isomer of the above-mentioned amino
acids that shows comparable racemization and beta-elimination
rates. furthermore, both racemization and beta-elimination
activities are competitively inhibited by l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate (figure 3a,c). it is therefore conceivable that the
low level of pyruvate formed from  xxxd5xxx  might originate
from beta-elimination of  xxxd3193xxx  produced from  xxxd5xxx  by its
racemization. this model would still be consistent with the
conclusion of foltyn et al., who recently reported that serine
racemase decreases  xxxd5xxx  levels in vivo by  xxxd5xxx  beta-elimination to pyruvate (33).
there are several examples of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
(plp) dependent enzymes that act on amino acids and display
ambiguous reaction specificities. in the plp-dependent
enzymes the common initial reaction intermediate, the
external aldimine, may undergo isomerization and destabilization at different sites, which results in different reaction
specificities (34, 41). for example, r-amino acid decarboxylases can catalyze transaminations (42), aspartate aminotransferase racemization (43), tryptophan synthase has been shown
to catalyze racemization and transamination (44), and glycine
hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzes r-decarboxylation (45),
transamination, and racemization (46) as side reactions.
however, the side reactions of plp-dependent enzymes are
typically about 1-2 or more orders of magnitude slower than
the “main” reaction. this is not the case with msr, with
which the beta-elimination activity toward all known substrates
is either comparable to ( xxxd3193xxx ) or higher than the racemization activity. the high beta-elimination activity of msr
corresponds to its significant sequence similarity to serine/
threonine dehydratases and less significant similarity to other
racemases (12). proteins showing sequence similarity to msr
also occur in organisms that do not even have nmda
receptors such as saccharomyces cerevisiae or arabidopsis
thaliana. interestingly, the msr homologue from s. cerevisiae was shown to have an l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate
dehydratase activity but failed to racemize serine (47).
it is not clear what the physiological significance of msr
beta-elimination activity is. it is likely of no importance for
energy metabolism, as glycolysis produces approximately
1000 times more pyruvate than could be produced by msr
[based on the observed turnover of  xxxd5xxx  in brain (38)]. it
has been recently suggested that the beta-eliminase activity of
msr could regulate intracellular  xxxd5xxx  levels in vivo by
balancing the rates of its synthesis from  xxxd3193xxx  and degradation into pyruvate (33). considering that  xxxd5xxx  beta-elimination
activity of msr is about 1 order of magnitude lower than
 xxxd3193xxx  beta-elimination activity in our experiments, appreciable
 xxxd5xxx  degradation, be it through direct beta-elimination of  xxxd5xxx 

substrate specificity of  xxxg2204xxx 
or through its racemization and subsequent beta-elimination of
 xxxd3193xxx  (the racemization product), could only be observed if
the  xxxd5xxx  concentration locally approaches or exceeds that
of  xxxd3193xxx . this model again implies the necessity of a
particular compartmentation of msr within the cytosol. it
is intriguing that msr is expressed also in liver (12), where
no  xxxd5xxx  is needed for neurotransmission and where high
levels of  xxxg602xxx  ( xxxg602xxx ) activity are present
(48). conceivably, the role of the msr in liver might be
degradatory, relying on its beta-elimination activity of  xxxd5xxx 
or other amino acids related to l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate.
the role of hydroxyaspartates in vivo remains unknown.
there are reports based on amino acid analysis and thinlayer chromatography that describe high concentrations of
hydroxyaspartate in the cerebrospinal fluid of human patients,
but the exact stereochemistry of the compound was not
determined (49, 50). an enzymatically active isolate from
rabbit skeletal muscle that catalyzes the synthesis of l-erythro3-hydroxyaspartate from dihydroxyfumarate and l-glutamate
(51) has been reported. l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate has been
used in neurobiology as a competitive inhibitor of lglutamate high-affinity transporters (52). when exogenously
added to neocortical minislices, it can accumulate within the
 xxxd233xxx  and  xxxd2431xxx  secretion pool and be secreted in a
potassium- and calcium-dependent manner (53). it has been
observed that in vivo a local administration of l-threo-3hydroxyaspartate together with malonate induces rigidity in
rats and damages neurons in some parts of the brain (54).
exogenously added l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate apparently
inhibits the inward transport of  xxxd2431xxx  from extracellular space
and thus causes glutamate excitotoxicity and subsequent
damage to adjacent neurons. we cannot exclude the presence
of endogenous l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate in vivo. if that
was the case, it would be attractive to speculate that
glutamate signaling in the cns might be modulated by this
endogenous glutamate transport inhibitor.  xxxg2204xxx 
would then have a dual role in this scheme: producing a
coactivator of nmda receptors,  xxxd5xxx , and downregulating the levels of l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate, an inhibitor
of glutamate retrotransport, to prevent glutamate excitotoxicity.
our inhibitor analysis reveals that the most important
structural feature for binding to msr is the presence of two
adjacent carboxylates with optimal c-c distances of 2.63.2 å. the presence of an r-amino group and a beta-hydroxyl
or another suitable leaving group at the beta-carbon further
increases the affinity of the ligand for msr and is necessary
to make a compound a  xxxg2204xxx  substrate. interestingly, inversion of configuration at the beta-carbon transforms
the most efficient beta-elimination substrate, l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (table 3), into the most potent competitive inhibitor
of sr, the l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate (table 2). it has to
be pointed out that malonate is almost as potent an inhibitor
as l- xxxd2033xxx -3-hydroxyaspartate even though it does not have
an r-amino group.
these structural considerations are only qualitative, and
the interactions of the compounds with the enzyme may
thermodynamically compensate for the internal stabilization
effects predicted by quantum chemical calculations. we
propose that binding to msr constrains the position of the
two carboxylate groups of a hydroxyaspartate diastereoisomer
in a close proximity (as seen in maleate and malonate) and

biochemistry, vol. 44, no. 39, 2005 13099
the r-amino group becomes fixed in the external aldimine
formed with plp. as a consequence, the l-threo and
l- xxxd2033xxx  isomers of 3-hydroxyaspartate have their beta-hydroxyl pointing in different directions when bound to the
enzyme, and only the l-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate beta-hydroxyl
is suitably juxtapositioned to an active site residue to enable
catalysis. this model could have significant implications for
prospective msr inhibitor design.
