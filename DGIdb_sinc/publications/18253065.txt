(5 mg/kg, i.p.) exerted barely additive interactions with all

abstract
this study focused on the evaluation of interactions between mrz 2/576 (8-chloro-4-hydroxy-1-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridazino(4,5-b)quinoline-5-oxide choline salt), an n -methyl- d -aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist acting at the
nmda receptor/glycineb site and four newer antiepileptic
drugs ( xxxd2090xxx , lamotrigine,  xxxd2809xxx , and topiramate) in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure model. results indicate that mrz 2/576 administered intraperitoneally,
5 min before the test, exerted a clear-cut anticonvulsant effect in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice and its
ed50 value was 13.71 (11.95–15.73) mg/kg. in the subthreshold method, mrz 2/576 (administered intraperitoneally, at a
subthreshold dose of 5 mg/kg) significantly enhanced the
anticonvulsant action of  xxxd2090xxx ,  xxxd2809xxx  and topiramate, by reducing their ed50 values from 73.0 to 53.8 mg/
kg (p ! 0.05) for  xxxd2090xxx , from 10.77 to 7.48 mg/kg (p !
0.05) for  xxxd2809xxx , and from 49.3 to 28.7 mg/kg (p !
0.01) for topiramate. in contrast, mrz 2/576 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) did
not significantly affect the antiseizure effects of lamotrigine
in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice. isobolographic transformation of data revealed that mrz 2/576

monotherapy in epilepsy remains the preferred method in the treatment of epileptic patients. however, there
are still around 30% of epileptic patients who are refractory to the applied monotherapy with current frontline
antiepileptic drugs, and novel treatment options are required for these patients to suppress their seizure attacks
[1, 2]. one of the methods used in the treatment of patients with refractory epilepsy is polytherapy (with two
or more antiepileptic drugs) [3]. on the other hand, experimental research studies focused on the elaboration of
novel antiepileptic drugs with unique antiseizure profiles
or novel formulations of available antiepileptic drugs.
generally, to suppress seizures in both experimental and
clinical conditions, one should activate gabaergic inhibitory neurotransmission and/or suppress the excitatory amino acid neurotransmission in the brain [4]. the

enhance the anticonvulsant properties of newer antiepileptic drugs against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice, as well as to determine the characteristics
of interactions between drugs.

materials and methods
animals and experimental conditions
adult male swiss mice (weighing 22–26 g) that were kept in
colony cages with free access to food and tap water, under standardized housing conditions (natural light-dark cycle, temperature of 23 8 1 ° c, relative humidity of 55 8 5%), were used. after
7 days of adaptation to laboratory conditions, the animals were
randomly assigned to experimental groups comprising 8 mice
each. each mouse was used only once and all tests were performed
between 08: 00 and 15: 00 h. procedures involving animals and
their care were conducted in accordance with current european
community and polish legislation on animal experimentation.
additionally, all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering
and to use only the number of animals necessary to produce reliable scientific data. the experimental procedures described here
were approved by the local ethics committee at the medical university of lublin (license no. 46/2006) and complied with the
european communities council directive of november 24, 1986
(86/609/eec).
drugs
the following drugs were used: mrz 2/576 (8-chloro-4-hydroxy-1-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridazino(4,5-b)quinoline-5-oxide
choline salt – kindly donated by merz pharmaceuticals gmbh,
frankfurt am main, germany),  xxxd2090xxx  ( xxxd2090xxx , schering
plough, levallois-perret, france), lamotrigine (lamictal, glaxowellcome, kent, uk),  xxxd2809xxx  (trileptal, novartis pharma
ag, basel, switzerland), and topiramate (topamax, cilag ag,
schaffhausen, switzerland). all drugs, except for mrz 2/576, were
suspended in a 1% solution of tween 80 (sigma, st. louis, mo.,
usa) in sterile saline, whereas mrz 2/576 was dissolved in sterile
saline. the drugs were administered intraperitoneally, as a single
injection, in a volume of 5 ml/kg body weight. fresh drug solutions
were prepared on each day of experimentation and administered
as follows:  xxxd2090xxx , lamotrigine, and topiramate were administered 60 min,  xxxd2809xxx  – 30 min, and mrz 2/576 – 5 min
before the electroconvulsions. route of intraperitoneal administration and pretreatment times of the drugs were based on information about their biological activity from the literature [6, 8] and
confirmed in our previous studies [10]. noteworthy: these pretreatment times refer to the peak of maximum anticonvulsant activity of newer antiepileptic drugs used in this study.
maximal electroconvulsions
electroconvulsions were produced by means of an alternating
current (0.2 s stimulus duration, 50 hz, maximum stimulation
voltage of 500 v) delivered via earclip electrodes by a rodent
shocker generator (type 221, hugo sachs elektronik, freiburg,
germany). the electrical system of the stimulator was self-adjustable so that changes in impedance did not result in alterations of
current intensity (i.e., the system provides constant current stim-

drugs are related either to the enhancement of gabaergic neurotransmission through the activation of gabaa
receptor ionophore complex (benzodiazepines and phenobarbital) or the increase in gaba content into the synaptic clefts (vigabatrin and tiagabine) [4]. on the other
hand, some antiepileptic drugs are able to suppress excitatory amino acid neurotransmission through the interaction with n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda), ␣-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa),
or kainate receptors (topiramate, phenobarbital,  xxxd2090xxx ) [5]. at present, the discovery of novel substances
active in the suppression of seizures through the blockade
of nmda and/or ampa/kainate receptors, resulted in
the elaboration of mrz 2/576 (8-chloro-4-hydroxy-1oxo-1,2-dihydropyridazino(4,5-b)quinoline-5-oxide
choline salt), belonging to a novel class of nmda receptor/glycineb site antagonists [6, 7]. mrz 2/576 binds with
nanomolar affinity to the glycineb site of the nmda receptor complex and thus reduces responses to nmda [6].
the duration of the anticonvulsant action of mrz 2/576
is rather short and the peak to maximum anticonvulsant
effect has been noted 5–7 min after its intraperitoneal
administration [6].
previously, it has been documented that mrz 2/576
potentiated the antiseizure effects of four conventional
antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate), as well as  xxxd2809xxx  in the
maximal electroshock-induced seizure test in mice [8].
moreover, mrz 2/576 produced a clear-cut anticonvulsant action in nmr mice subjected to the maximal electroshock-induced seizures, with an ed50 value of 20.8
(15.2–28.4) mg/kg [7]. noteworthy: the maximal electroshock induced seizures are thought to be an experimental model of tonic-clonic seizures and, to a certain extent, of partial convulsions with or without secondary
generalization in man [9]. this animal model is designated as a screen allowing determination of the anticonvulsant properties of drugs and substances which are
able to suppress tonic-clonic seizures in epileptic patients [9].
considering the above-mentioned facts it was of pivotal importance to determine the anticonvulsant profile
of mrz 2/576 administered alone and in combination
with four newer antiepileptic drugs in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice. in this study, the interactions of mrz 2/576 with  xxxd2090xxx , topiramate, lamotrigine, and  xxxd2809xxx  were assessed with both the subthreshold method and isobolographic transformation.
the present study attempted to test the ability of the
nmda receptor/glycineb site antagonist mrz 2/576 to

maximal electroshock seizure threshold test
to evaluate the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions, at
least four groups of mice receiving vehicle, consisting of 8 animals
per group, were challenged with electroshocks of various intensities to yield 10–30, 30–50, 50–70, and 70–90% of animals with seizures. then, a current intensity-response relationship curve was
constructed for control animals, according to a log-probit method
by litchfield and wilcoxon [11], from which a median current
strength (cs50 in ma) was calculated. the cs50 value represents
the current intensity required to induce tonic hindlimb extension
in 50% of the mice challenged. afterwards, after administration
of a single dose of mrz 2/576 to four other groups of animals, the
mice were subjected to electroconvulsions (each group with a constant current intensity), similarly as the control animals. the
threshold for maximal electroconvulsions was recorded for four
different doses of mrz 2/576: 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg. each cs50
value was determined in novel experimental groups of animals,
and each mouse was subjected only once to the threshold evaluation procedure (electroshock stimulation). thus, there were no
multiple electroconvulsive stimulations in mice. subsequently, the
percentage of increase in cs50 values for animals injected with increasing doses of mrz 2/576 over the control (vehicle-treated animals) was calculated. the experimental procedure has been described in more detail in our earlier studies [12–14].
maximal electroshock seizure test
the protective activity of mrz 2/576 and the newer antiepileptic drugs ( xxxd2090xxx , lamotrigine,  xxxd2809xxx  and topiramate) was determined as their median effective doses (ed50 values in mg/kg) against maximal electroshock-induced seizures
(fixed current intensity of 25 ma). the animals were administered with different drug doses so as to obtain a variable percentage of protection in the maximal electroshock seizure test, allowing construction of a dose-response relationship curve for each
drug administered alone, according to litchfield and wilcoxon
[11]. each ed50 value represents the dose of a drug required to
protect half of the animals tested against maximal electroshock
seizures. similarly, the anticonvulsant activity of a mixture of an
antiepileptic drug with a constant subthreshold dose of mrz
2/576 was evaluated and expressed as ed50 corresponding to the
dose of an antiepileptic drug necessary to protect 50% of mice
against tonic hindlimb extension in the maximal electroshock
seizure test. this experimental procedure has been described in
detail in our earlier studies [10, 14].
isobolographic transformation
the isobolographic analysis is an experimental method applied to determine pharmacological interactions among drugs
[15, 16]. theoretically, the isobolographic analysis distinguishes
five most important types of interactions: additivity, supra-additivity (synergy), indifference, sub-additivity (relative antagonism)
and infra-additivity (absolute antagonism) [15, 17]. undoubtedly,
isobolography is a universal method which may be experimen-

mrz 2/576 and newer antiepileptic
drugs in the mes test

tally used for the examination of interactions among drugs exerting the same effect(s) [15, 16].
isobolographic transformation of data from the subthreshold
method was based on the evaluation of interaction produced by
two-drug mixture according to loewe [17]. theoretically, two
drugs co-applied at the respective fractions of their ed50 values
exert additive interaction if the sum of their fractions is equal to
1 [17]. the calculation of the respective ed50 fractions was performed according to the equation of additivity, as follows: x/x +
y/y = 1, where x and y are doses of the first and second drug in
the mixture, x and y are the ed50 values of the drugs administered alone, and x/x and y/y are fractions of the respective ed50
values present in the mixture. thus, mrz 2/576 at a dose of 5 mg/
kg was transformed to its ed50 fraction, which was 5/13.7 = 0.365.
the ed50 fraction of newer antiepileptic drugs in mixture was
calculated by dividing the ed50 value of an antiepileptic drug in
combination with mrz 2/576 by the ed50 value of the antiepileptic drug administered alone. finally, summing the ed50 fractions
of both drugs (i.e., the fractions of mrz 2/576 and the respective
antiepileptic drug) present in mixture, one determines, in approximation, the isobolographic characteristic of interaction between the investigated antiepileptic drugs. noteworthy: additivity is indicated if the sum of the respective ed50 fractions is between the values of 0.7 and 1.3 [18, 19]. supra-additivity (synergy)
is present if the sum of ed50 fractions is !0.7, and sub-additivity
(antagonism) is evident if the sum of ed50 fractions is 11.3 [18,
19]. this experimental procedure has been described in detail in
our earlier studies [20–22].
the isobolographic transformation of data provided us with
information about the characteristics of interactions between
drugs, especially if one of the drugs in the mixture is applied at a
constant subthreshold dose (mrz 2/576). because the method of
isobolographic analysis is considered as the ‘gold standard’ in the
detection of interactions between drugs in both experimental
studies on animals and clinical settings [16, 23], we applied the
isobolographic transformation of data to examine and classify interactions between newer antiepileptic drugs and mrz 2/576 in
the maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice [for more details, see 22].
statistics
both cs50 and ed50 values with their 95% confidence limits
were calculated by computer log-probit analysis according to litchfield and wilcoxon [11]. subsequently, the respective 95% confidence limits were transformed to standard errors of the mean
(sem) as described previously [13, 14]. statistical analysis of data
from both electroconvulsive tests was performed with one-way
analysis of variance (anova) followed by the post-hoc tukeykramer test for multiple comparisons. differences among values
were considered statistically significant if p ! 0.05.

the compound at doses of 7.5 and 10 mg/kg markedly
increased the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice
from 5.50 ma (control) to 7.31 ma (p ! 0.05), and 8.43
ma (p ! 0.001), respectively (table 1). in contrast, mrz
2/576 administered at lower doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg did
not significantly alter the threshold in experimental animals, although a slight increase in the cs50 values from
5.50 ma (control) to 6.07 and 6.24 ma, respectively, was
documented (table 1).
effects of mrz 2/576 on the protective action
of newer antiepileptic drugs in the maximal
electroshock-induced seizure model –
a subthreshold method
the investigated newer antiepileptic drugs ( xxxd2090xxx ,
lamotrigine,  xxxd2809xxx  and topiramate) administered alone exhibited a clear-cut anticonvulsant activity
in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice and
their ed50 values are presented in table 2. when mrz
2/576 at 5 mg/kg was co-administered with  xxxd2090xxx , it
262

pharmacology 2008;81:259–265

significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant effect of the
latter drug against maximal electroshock-induced seizures by reducing its ed50 value from 73.0 to 53.8 mg/kg
(p ! 0.05; table 2). in contrast, mrz 2/576 at the lower
dose of 2.5 mg/kg did not significantly potentiate the antiseizure activity of  xxxd2090xxx , although a reduction in its
ed50 value was observed in the maximal electroshock
seizure test (from 73.0 to 67.0 mg/kg; table 2). in the case
of  xxxd2809xxx , mrz 2/576 at a dose of 5 mg/kg significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant action of  xxxd2809xxx  by reducing its ed50 value from 10.77 to 7.48
mg/kg (p ! 0.05; table 2). however, mrz 2/576 administered systemically (i.p.) at the lower dose of 2.5 mg/kg did
not significantly affect the antiseizure potential of  xxxd2809xxx  in the maximal electroshock seizure test in
mice, although the agent reduced its ed50 value from
10.77 to 8.71 mg/kg (table 2). with respect to topiramate,
it was found that mrz 2/576 at 5 mg/kg markedly potentiated the anticonvulsant action of topiramate by reducing its ed50 value from 49.3 to 28.7 mg/kg (p ! 0.01, table 2). mrz 2/576 administered intraperitoneally at 2.5
and 1.25 mg/kg also decreased the ed50 of topiramate in
the maximal electroshock seizure test, however the results did not attain statistical significance with the posthoc tukey-kramer test (table 2). the assessment of the
antiseizure action of lamotrigine in combination with
mrz 2/576 revealed that the nmda receptor/glycineb
site antagonist (administered intraperitoneally, at subthreshold doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg), did not significantly alter the antiseizure action of lamotrigine in the maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice (table 2).
isobolographic transformation of data from the
subthreshold method
isobolographic transformation revealed that all investigated combinations of mrz 2/576 with newer antiepileptic drugs were additive in the maximal electroshock seizure test (table 2). the calculated fractions of ed50 values
for mrz 2/576 and newer antiepileptic drugs ranged between 0.853 (for the combination of mrz 2/576 at 2.5 mg/
kg with topiramate at 33.1 mg/kg) and 1.102 (for the combination of mrz 2/576 at 5 mg/kg with  xxxd2090xxx  at 53.8
mg/kg), indicating the additive interactions (table 2).

here we showed that mrz 2/576 increased, in a dosedependent manner, the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in experimental animals. our results are in

mrz 2/576/ed50 value of the antiepileptic drug administered
alone [17]. fractions of mrz 2/576 were calculated by dividing the
constant doses of the drug present in mixture by the ed50 value
of mrz 2/576 administered alone. n = total number of animals
used at doses whose expected anticonvulsant effects ranged between 4 and 6 probits; sem = standard error of the mean of ed50;
a = additive characteristic of interactions between the studied
drugs. additivity was corroborated if the sum of respective fractions was between the border values of 0.7 and 1.3 [18, 19]. for
more details, see luszczki and czuczwar [22].
a p < 0.05 and b p < 0.01 vs. the respective control group ( xxxd2090xxx  + saline-,  xxxd2809xxx  + saline-, or topiramate + salinetreated animals).

agreement with those documented earlier, showing that
mrz 2/576 at 5 mg/kg had no impact on the threshold
and the drug at a dose of 10 mg/kg, significantly increased
the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice [8]. moreover, it has been documented that mrz 2/576 potentiated
the anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine, phenytoin,
phenobarbital valproate and  xxxd2809xxx  in the maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice [8]. in this
study, we have extended those findings by the evaluation

of anticonvulsant effects of topiramate, lamotrigine and
 xxxd2090xxx  in combination with mrz 2/576 in the maximal electroshock seizure test. furthermore, a comparison of results obtained for the combination of mrz 2/576
with  xxxd2809xxx  was performed. with the subthreshold method we observed that mrz 2/576 (at 5 mg/kg)
enhanced the antiseizure action of  xxxd2090xxx ,  xxxd2809xxx  and topiramate, but not that of lamotrigine in the
maximal electroshock seizure test in mice. the isobolo-

formation assesses the effects produced by a two-drug
mixture (mrz 2/576 co-administered with one of the
tested antiepileptic drugs) and classifies interactions exerted by the mixture. in contrast, the subthreshold method evaluates the effects produced only by antiepileptic
drugs, totally neglecting the effects exerted by mrz 2/576
used at subthreshold doses. because drugs in mixture
usually exert interactions (whose nature may be synergistic, additive or antagonistic), the isobolographic transformation is superior over the subthreshold method in the
detection of the anticonvulsant effects exerted by drugs
in mixture.
this study clearly shows that isobolographic transformation of data can be readily utilized in preclinical studies during the search for agents possessing the anticonvulsant properties in vivo. in our opinion, the procedure
of isobolographic transformation of data can be applied
as a paradigm in preclinical studies allowing assessment
of the profile of interactions between the investigated
drugs. the isobolographic transformation of data introduced to experimental studies as a standard procedure
can help in preselection of agents or compounds that interact synergistically with established antiepileptic drugs.
such a preselection may substantially contribute to a
more efficacious combination of antiepileptic drugs in
further clinical settings. quite recently, a comparative
study has revealed a close correlation between the antiseizure effects of two-drug mixtures of antiepileptic
drugs in patients with refractory epilepsy and those determined in preclinical studies on animals [3]. it has been
found that some antiepileptic drug combinations, efficacious in clinical settings in suppressing seizure attacks in
epileptic patients, were also favorable (synergistic) in experimental models of epilepsy in rodents [3]. since a close
correlation exists between some antiepileptic drug combinations in terms of their favorable effects in both clinical and preclinical studies, each experimental method allowing selection of synergistic interactions in preclinical
studies is of pivotal importance for further clinical settings. thus, the incorporation of isobolographic transformation of data to preclinical experimental methodology might be helpful in searching for advantageous
antiepileptic drug combinations, offering synergistic interactions.
previously, with isobolographic transformation of
data, it has been reported that the combinations of  xxxd2809xxx  with carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin,
valproate and clonazepam produced additive interactions in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice
[22]. similarly, additivity was reported for the combinaluszczki /danysz /czuczwar

graphic transformation of data revealed that the observed
interactions of mrz 2/576 combined with  xxxd2090xxx ,  xxxd2809xxx , lamotrigine and topiramate were additive
in the maximal electroshock seizure test.
noteworthy in our study is that statistical analysis of
data for multiple comparisons was performed with oneway anova followed by the post-hoc tukey-kramer
test, whereas the results presented earlier were compared
separately with litchfield and wilcoxon method [8]. as
documented previously, the use of the log-probit method
only to statistically analyze experimental data may not be
as precise and adequate as one expects, especially when
performing several comparisons [12]. therefore, we proposed the application of the log-probit method only to
special experiments [12].
moreover, the present study indicated that mrz 2/576
possessed a clear-cut anticonvulsant action in the maximal electroshock seizure test and its ed50 value was 13.7
(12.0–15.7) mg/kg. this finding is congruous with a previous report showing that mrz 2/576 suppressed maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice with an ed50
value of 20.8 (15.2–28.4) mg/kg [7].
it is noteworthy that the test evaluating the threshold
for electroconvulsions in mice is more sensitive than the
maximal electroshock-induced seizure test in the detection of anticonvulsant properties of agents or potentially
favorable antiepileptic drugs that could be used in clinical practice. for instance, some antiepileptic drugs (i.e.,
 xxxd2466xxx , gabapentin, vigabatrin, and tiagabine) are
virtually ineffective in the maximal electroshock-induced seizure test [24], although they significantly increase the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice and
simultaneously these drugs are effective in epileptic patients with refractory partial seizures with or without
secondary generalization [25]. in our opinion, the application of the threshold for electroconvulsions and maximal electroshock-induced seizure tests in mice was appropriate, especially in light of the fact that both seizure
tests were used to determine the antiseizure effects of the
investigated substance (mrz 2/576).
it should be stressed that in the present study the same
experimental data were analyzed independently with two
diverse methods. the first method was based on the evaluation of effects produced by newer antiepileptic drugs
co-administered with mrz 2/576 at subthreshold doses
(sub-effective doses, which by themselves did not affect
the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice). the second
method was based on the isobolographic analysis of interactions between mrz 2/576 and newer antiepileptic
drugs. it should be stressed that the isobolographic trans-

tions of riluzole with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and valproate in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice [20]. in contrast, the combinations of
 xxxd2090xxx  with valproate, phenobarbital, clonazepam
and  xxxd2056xxx  in the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure model exerted antagonistic interactions with isobolographic transformation of data, although the subthreshold method indicated that antiepileptic drugs potentiated their anticonvulsant effects in mice [21].
finally, one can conclude that mrz 2/576 additively
cooperates with  xxxd2090xxx , lamotrigine,  xxxd2809xxx 
and topiramate in terms of suppression of maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice. the isobolographic
transformation of data should be included in preclinical

screening tests to analyze interaction profiles of combined drugs with respect to their anticonvulsant effects
and to elicit some favorable combinations of antiepileptic
drugs, offering synergistic interactions as regards seizure
suppression.
