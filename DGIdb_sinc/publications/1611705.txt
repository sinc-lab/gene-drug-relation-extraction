effect of  xxxd2341xxx  on  xxxg2296xxx  production in endotoxic shock.   xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) is a macrophage-derived mediator responsible for many of the pathophysiologic manifestations of endotoxic shock. we now demonstrate that  xxxd2341xxx , a noncatechol inotrope, strongly inhibits lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf production at concentrations readily achieved in vivo. this inhibition is apparent in murine macrophages, in macrophage cell lines, in vivo, and in cell lines containing a reporter gene construct that substitutes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) coding sequence for the tnf coding sequence and introns. inhibition by  xxxd2341xxx  (like inhibition by  xxxd2880xxx ) is manifested at the level of mrna accumulation, in contrast to inhibition caused by dexamethasone. combined application of dexamethasone and  xxxd2341xxx  caused additive inhibition of tnf biosynthesis in vitro. furthermore, treatment of mice with  xxxd2341xxx  immediately prior to endotoxin challenge led to significantly improved survival. these findings suggest that  xxxd2341xxx  possesses antiinflammatory as well as inotropic properties that may make it an appropriate agent for use in septic shock or other serious bacterial infections. abrupt removal of  xxxd2341xxx  or  xxxd2880xxx  from the culture medium prior to lps stimulation, however, caused significantly augmented tnf production. therefore,  xxxd2341xxx  and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also enhance sensitivity to lps during a period of time following discontinuation of therapy.
