summary
 xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism ( xxxg1475xxx 
c677t) is an established determinant of homocysteine plasma
level (t-hcys) while its association with coronary artery disease
(cad) seems to be more limited. in contrast, the association of
the substitutions a2756g of  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr), a66g of
 xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) and c776g of transcobalamin (tcn) to both t-hcys and cad needs to be evaluated
further.the objective was to evaluate the association of these
polymorphisms with t-hcys and cad in a french population.
we investigated the individual and combined effects of these
polymorphisms and of  xxxd1771xxx  and folates with t-hcys in
530 cad patients and 248 matched healthy controls. t-hcys
was higher in the cad group than in controls (11.8 vs 10.4 µm,
p<0.0001) and in carriers of  xxxg1480xxx  aa and  xxxg1475xxx  677tt than in

introduction
homocysteine is a non-protein forming, sulphur amino acid that
results from the demethylation of the essential amino acid methionine (fig. 1). hyperhomocysteinemia was first described in
premature coronary artery disease (1) and later as a possible independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and thromboembolism
(2–5). plasma homocysteine (t-hcys) level depends on micronutrients, mainly folates and  xxxd1771xxx , (4) and on single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes from target enzymes:  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ) (5),  xxxg1479xxx 
(mtr) (6), and  xxxg1479xxx  reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ) (7).

those carrying the most frequent allele of both polymorphisms
(13.8 vs 11.4 µm, p=0.0102 and 12.5 vs 11.0 mm, p=0.0065 respectively).the frequency of  xxxg1480xxx  a allele was higher in cad
patients than in controls (0.48 [95% ci: 0.44–0.52] vs 0.38 [95%
ci: 0.32–0.44], p=0.0081) while no difference was observed for
 xxxg1475xxx  677t frequency. in multivariate analysis, t-hcys > median and mtrraa genotype were two significant independent predictors of cad with respective odds ratios of 3.1 (95 % ci:
1.8–5.1, p<0.0001) and 4.5 (95% ci: 1.5–13.1, p=0.0051). in conclusion, in contrast to north europe studies,  xxxg1480xxx  aa genotype
is a genetic determinant of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia
associated with cad in a french population without vitamin
fortification.

 xxxg1475xxx  catalyses the synthesis of methyletetrahydrofolate, the
methyl donor of homocysteine and mtr,  xxxg1480xxx  are two key
enzymes for the synthesis of methionine by remethylation of
homocysteine. a genetic polymorphism in the transcobalamin
gene (tcn) is another genetic trait that may influence homocysteine metabolism (8).
the c677t genetic polymorphism in the  xxxg1475xxx  gene, leading to a substitution of an alanine residue for a valine in the
amino acid consensus sequence, was found to be associated with
a thermo-labile variant of the enzyme with a reduced activity (9).
several epidemiological, as well as biochemical studies described an association of either homozygosity for the c677t mu-

tation or increased t-hcys with the risk for coronary artery disease (cad) (10–12). nevertheless, a number of subsequent
studies have produced conflicting results, suggesting complex
interactions between environmental and genetic factors (13–16).
two other single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified
in  xxxg1475xxx , a1298c and a silent mutation t1317c (17). double
heterozygous 677 ct/1298 ac genotypes of  xxxg1475xxx  are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, particularly in patients with
low folate blood level (18). the polymorphisms of mtr and
 xxxg1480xxx  and that of tcn may theoretically influence the cellular
metabolism and blood transport of  xxxd1771xxx , respectively.
however, the a2756g genotype of mtr is not related to hyperhomocysteinemia, despite a hypothetical reduced catalytic activity (19, 20). conflicting data have been reported on the association of mtr a2756g and  xxxg1480xxx  a66g polymorphisms with the
risk of cad. transcobalamin (tc) is the critical transporter that
delivers  xxxd1771xxx  to peripheral tissues, and heterozygosity
for the tcn c776g polymorphism has been associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (8). this polymorphism was not associated
with thrombotic diseases in a recent case control study from italy
(21). finally, the combined effect of  xxxg1475xxx , mtr and  xxxg1480xxx 
and tcn polymorphisms on the risk of cad has never been
evaluated.
objectives
to evalute the association of polymorphisms related to the metabolism of  xxxd1771xxx  in blood and cells with homocysteine
and cad in a french population.

methods
patients and controls
a case-control study was carried out on a total of 778 subjects,
including 530 cad patients recruited in two departments of
cardiology, and 248 healthy volunteers from a centre of preventive medicine. all individuals were french of european origin.
the protocol of this study was approved by the local ethic committees, and every subject included gave written consent.
the cad group comprised angiographically-documented
patients, with >50 % stenosis of at least one of the major coronary or peripheral vessels. exclusion criteria were recent (less
than 6 months) acute events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, history of viral myopericarditis, renal failure (creatinine >20 mg/l) or acute congestive heart failure. the main
clinical characteristics of the patients are given in table 1. the
control group comprised healthy volunteers with no known coronary or peripheral artery disease. controls matched the individuals of the cad group for age and sex.
none of the subjects from the control or the cad patients
group received any treatment or  xxxd2716xxx  supplementation that
could influence  xxxd1771xxx , folate or homocysteine metabolism.

figure 1: the metabolic chart of homocysteine and the
enzymes involved in the activated methyl cycle,  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ),  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr)
and mtr reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ). homocysteine is either converted into
methionine by re-methylation or degraded into cystathionine by transsulfuration. tetrahydrofolate (thf) and methylene-tetrahydrofolate
(ch2-thf) are the substrates of two branch points of the folate cycle.
transcobalamin (tc) is a binding protein which delivers dietary vitamin
b12 to cells.  xxxd1771xxx  and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (ch3-thf) are
the co-factor and the co-substrate of mtr, respectively. the cobalt of
 xxxd1771xxx  is reduced from cob ii to cob i by  xxxg1480xxx  in order to allow
the formation of methylcobalamin in the catalytic cycle of mtr.

statistical methods
categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages,
and continuous variables as means ± sd, median, 25th and 75th
interquartils. for categorical variables, a continuity-corrected
chi-square test was used to assess differences. for continuous
variables, a mann-whitney u-test or a kruskal-wallis test were
employed. a multiple linear regression analysis was used to
evaluate the significant independent determinants of t-hcys. the
significance, odds ratios (or) and 95 % confidence interval of
independent categorical and continuous variables regarding the
risk of cad were determined by multivariate stepwise logistic
regression analysis using a model that included age, sex and the
variables that had a p-value <0.10 in univariate analyses. the
stepwise considered only the variables with p-value <0.10 as residual independent determinants. a p-value lower than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. data were prospectively collected
and analyzed using the statview 5 software for windows (sas
institute, berkley, california, usa) and the spss 10.0 software
for windows (spss, paris, france).

results
age and sex
there was no significant difference in sex ratio between the patients and control groups, with 386 (72.8 %, 95% ci: 0.69 – 0.76)
males in the cad group compared with 190 (76.6 %, 95% ci:
0.71 – 0.81) in the control group (p=0.2621). the mean ages of
the two groups were 58.6±12.9 and 60.3±11.3 years, respectively
(p=0.1118).
homocysteine, folate and b12 levels
male subjects had higher homocysteine levels (median [interquartiles]: 11.7 [9.5 – 14.8 µm] ) than female subjects (9.9 [7.5
– 13.9 µm], p < 0.0001), in the whole population. plasma t-hcys
levels were higher in cad patients than in control group (11.8
[9.0 – 15.3] vs 10.4, [8.7 – 12.5] µm, p <0.0001); when stratifying the comparison according to sex, the difference remained
significant only for male (11.7 [9.5 –14.8 µm] ) vs 9.9 [7.5 – 13.9
µm] ), p <0.0001). the folate level was lower in the cad group
than in the control group (7.8 [4.8 – 12.3] vs 13.0 [10.0 – 16.2]
nm, respectively, p <0.0001). conversely,  xxxd1771xxx  level was
higher in the cad group than in controls (320.0 [240.7 – 430.0]
pm vs 264.0 [174.7 – 371.5] pm, p<0.0001). the plasma level of
both vitamins was not influenced by sex. in univariate regression
analysis, t-hcys levels was weakly and negatively associated
with  xxxd1771xxx  (spearman correlation coefficient = –0.08,
p=0.0416) but not with folate (p=0.2985).

influence of  xxxg1475xxx , mtr,  xxxg1480xxx  and tcn polymorphisms on the levels of homocysteine, folate and  xxxd1771xxx 
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t and  xxxg1480xxx  a66g were the two polymorphisms
significantly associated with an increased t-hcys in the whole
population (table 3). the carriers of mttrr 66aa had a
1.2-fold higher t-hcys than those carrying another  xxxg1480xxx  genotype (13.8 [9.9–16.9] vs 11.4 [9.0–14.5] µm, p=0.0102). those
carrying the  xxxg1475xxx  677tt had also an increased t-hcys (12.5
[9.9–16.6] vs 11.0 [8.9–14.3] µm, p=0.0065) and a decreased
folate level (8.2 [4.5–12.5] vs 9.4 [5.6–13.8] µm, p=0.0230).
when stratifying the analyses in function of cad, the association of  xxxg1480xxx  with t-hcys remained significant in controls
(p=0.0298) but not in the cad group (p=0.1881); the same observation was made with  xxxg1475xxx  c677t (p=0.0030 and
p=0.1237 in controls and cad, respectively). neither the
 xxxg1475xxx  haplotypes of the c677t and a1298c polymorphisms
nor the gene-gene combinations of the different polymorphisms
had any significant influence on t-hcys, folates and  xxxd1771xxx 
levels.
association of t-hcys,  xxxg1475xxx , mtr,  xxxg1480xxx  and tcn
polymorphisms with the risk of cad
we estimated by multivariate logistic regression analysis the association of cad risk with the increased level of homocysteine
and of the genetic polymorphisms (table 4). we included age,
sex,  xxxd1771xxx , folate and  xxxg1480xxx  polymorphism in the model
since the latter was the single determinant associated with cad
in univariate analysis. t-hcys (> median) and  xxxg1480xxx  aa carriers

were the two significant independent predictors of cad risk
(table 4).

discussion
our study confirmed the association of  xxxg1475xxx  with t-hcys that
has been observed in many studies but we found no influence on
cad risk as previously shown in a meta-analysis by brattström
et al. (15). another meta-analysis concluded that the three
 xxxg1475xxx  c677t genotypes conferred a different level of cad
risk (11). in agreement with a previous study, we found no increase of combined alleles 677t and 1298 c in our cad patients
(tables 2, 3) (24). the odds ratio of t-hcys/cad association estimated in our study was consistent with that reported in other
case control studies and higher than that estimated in two cohort
studies (25–26).
we investigated the association of mtr,  xxxg1480xxx  and tcn,
three polymorphisms related to  xxxd1771xxx  metabolism, with
t-hcys and cad in a french population that received neither folate fortification nor  xxxd2716xxx  supplementation. previous
studies performed in north america and north europe have produced conflicting conclusions (6, 26–29). a lowering effect of
the mtr a2756g variant on t-hcys has been reported with varying results (20, 30) and the evaluation of an association of this
polymorphism with cad risk also produced conflicting results.
we failed to find an association of the a2756g polymorphism of
mtr with either t-hcys or cad risk. three studies did not find
any association with cad despite an association of mtr 2756
ag and gg genotypes with a reduced t-hcys in healthy subjects
(6, 30, 31). a japanese study failed to find any association with
t-hcys and cad (20). in contrast, a study from australia showed
an interaction between the mtr 2756g allele and lifelong smoking dose in relation with the severity of cad (27) and a dutch
study reported a 4-fold increased risk of cad in 2756gg carriers, compared to the aa genotype (19). an apparently opposite
picture was found by hyndman et al. (29) who reported that heterozygosity for the mtr 2756g variant reduced secondary vascular events.  xxxg1480xxx  a66g polymorphism emerges as a potential
contributor to moderate hyperhomocyteinemia.  xxxg1480xxx  catalyzes the regeneration in a reduced form of methylcobalamin, a
cofactor of  xxxg1479xxx , during its catalytic cycle. con-

the genotype distributions of  xxxg1475xxx , mtr,  xxxg1480xxx  and tcn

even more discernible when considering the  xxxg1480xxx  66aa genotype, with a frequency 2.4-fold higher in cad patients
(p=0.0044).

sistent with our findings, gaughan et al. (31) reported a significantly higher homocysteine concentration in aa carriers of a
population of young men from north ireland, compared to carriers of the two other genotypes. similar to our study, they found
that the influence on t-hcys was independent of the combination
of  xxxg1480xxx  66aa genotype with other genotypes of  xxxg1475xxx  and
mtr. in contrast, vaugh et al. (33) showed that coexistence of
 xxxg1475xxx  677 tt/ xxxg1480xxx  ag genotype may exacerbate the effect
of  xxxg1475xxx  on homocysteine level and kluijtmans et al. (34)
found a high homocysteine level in gg carriers. other investigators did not detect a different homocysteine concentration
among  xxxg1480xxx  a66g genotypes (35). few case control studies
have investigated the association of  xxxg1480xxx  with cad risk, which
also produces contrasting results. in north america, the gg genotype was at risk in a series of relatively young cad patients
angiographically documented while no association was found in
a larger sample that had a broader age range (36–37). finally, the
apparent discrepancies may be possibly explained by differences
in the sample populations such as ethnic origin and dietary intake
of folate due to either fortified food and/or vitamin supplementation. a recent study in 452 young adults evaluated that genetic
factors contributed to 9% of the variance of t-hcys, to be compared with the 35% estimated for low folate and  xxxd1771xxx 
(34). to our knowledge, the present study is the only one performed in europe that excluded cases with either fortification or
supplementation. in our population,  xxxd1771xxx , but not folate,
correlated significantly with t-hcys. similar data were recently
produced in subjects supplemented with folate, indicating that
dependency of t-hcys on folate diminishes in subjects with folate repletion, whereas  xxxd1771xxx  became a more significant
determinant (37). our study was performed in france, an area

where the folate dietary intake of the population seems to be
better than in north europe (38–40). in addition, the comparison
with other studies from north america is also conditioned by the
recent increase of dietary folate in these countries where the fortification of cereals with folate has been introduced.
the influence of tcn 776 g allele on the cellular availability
of  xxxd1771xxx  has been documented by a weak increased blood
level of homocysteine and of methylmalonic acid in caucasians
(8, 41). however, this influence on t-hcys has been inconstantly
found in other small series of caucasians (21, 42).  xxxg2255xxx  776 g
allele decreases the transcription level and the cellular and plasma concentration of transcobalamin, the carrier protein which
delivers  xxxd1771xxx  to cells (8). one study found no association
of this polymorphism with cad risk in 130 dutch patients angiographically documented (42). another study found no association with thrombotic events in 155 consecutive patients from
italy (21). our study agreed with these data since we found no influence on t-hcys and no association with cad risk.
in conclusion, investigating the potential influence on t-hcys
of three polymorphisms related to cellular and blood metabolism
of  xxxd1771xxx , we found a significant association of  xxxg1480xxx 
a66g polymorphism with t-hcys and cad risk in a folate-repleted french population without folate fortification and vitamin
b supplementation. these results contrasted with previous
evaluations in populations from north america and north europe, suggesting that these risks may be conditioned by folate
and/or  xxxd1771xxx  status.
