abstract  xxxg946xxx  ( xxxg946xxx ) is an ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme, but
the exact expression pattern in mammalian tissues is still
unknown. the expression and cellular localization of
 xxxg946xxx  mrna were examined in male mice using real
time-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization
techniques. the rank order of  xxxg946xxx  mrna expression
across tissues exhibiting substantial levels of expression
was:testes  heart > cerebrum ‡ ileum > stomach =
liver = jejunum ‡ epididymis. in testes,  xxxg946xxx  mrna
was highly expressed in spermiogenic cells and leydig
cells. the signal was also expressed in the molecular layer,
purkinje cell layer, and white matter of cerebellum, the
pituicytes of neurohypophysis, the parafollicular cells and
follicular basement membrane of thyroid, the exocrine
portion of pancreas, the tubular epithelium of kidney, the

in the gastrointestinal tract,  xxxg946xxx  mrna expression was
mainly observed in the keratinized surface epithelium of
forestomach, the submucosal glands and serosa layers, and
further the paneth cells of intestines.  xxxg946xxx  mrna
appeared to be ubiquitously expressed in the parenchyma
of heart, liver, and lung. these results indicate that  xxxg946xxx 
exhibits a cell- and tissue-specific expression pattern in
mice.

introduction
reactive oxygen species (ros) are continuously generated during aerobic metabolism and can affect a number
of cellular functions. high levels of ros can result in
oxidative stress, including lipid peroxidation, dna
breakage, protein degradation, and enzyme inactivation
(rhee 1999; gutteridge and halliwell 2000). under
normal physiological conditions, the accumulation of
ros is prevented by endogenous antioxidants such as
superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase
(gpx)/glutathione/ xxxg981xxx , and thioredoxin
peroxidase/thioredoxin/ xxxg1826xxx  (mccord
1985).
selenium (se) is an essential micronutrient for mammals
because it is required to synthesize the amino acid selenocysteine that is necessary for the synthesis of selenoproteins (low and berry 1996; rayman 2000). the family of
gpx enzymes comprises several distinct mammalian
selenoproteins that catalyze the reduction of peroxides

123

238

generated by ros. cytosolic gpx (cgpx or  xxxg943xxx ), which
was the first discovered mammalian selenoprotein, has
been shown to be expressed in almost all tissues (mills
1957; flohe et al. 1973). in contrast, gastrointestinal gpx
( xxxg944xxx  or  xxxg944xxx ) is expressed predominantly in the liver,
intestine, and colon (chu and esworthy 1995). plasma gpx
(pgpx or  xxxg945xxx ) is found mainly in milk, plasma, kidney,
and alveolar fluid of the lung (takahashi et al. 1987;
avissar et al. 1994). gpx6 is only expressed in the olfactory epithelium in human (kryukov et al. 2003). the
 xxxg946xxx 
( xxxg946xxx  or  xxxg946xxx ) has been shown to be widely expressed
in several cell lines and rat tissues (imai et al. 1995);
however, tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns of
 xxxg946xxx  in mice has not been examined.
 xxxg946xxx  is the only known intracellular enzymatic
antioxidant that can directly reduce phospholipids and
cholesterol hydroperoxides in membranes and low-density
lipoproteins (ldl) (ursini et al. 1985; thomas et al.
1990). three isoforms of  xxxg946xxx  (cytosolic, mitochondrial,
and nuclear) have been shown to be derived from a single
gene on murine chromosome 10 (knopp et al. 1999) and to
be involved in a variety of cellular mechanisms, including
signal transduction, differentiation, inflammation, and
apoptosis (brigelius-flohe and flohe 2003; imai and
nakagawa 2003; nakagawa 2004). in addition,  xxxg946xxx 
also appears to be required for sperm maturation (ursini
et al. 1999; diaconu et al. 2006) and embryonic development in mice (imai et al. 2003; yant et al. 2003).
to our knowledge, tissue- and cell-specific expression
patterns of  xxxg946xxx  have not been examined in mice. the
aim of this study was to quantify relative expression levels
and to identify the specific cellular localization of  xxxg946xxx 
mrna in different tissues from male mice. the expression
of  xxxg946xxx  mrna in normal tissues might help elucidate
specific physiological roles of this widely-distributed
protein.

materials and methods
animals
male icr mice (9 weeks old; biogenomics co., seoul,
korea) were housed in polycarbonate cages in a wellventilated room maintained at 21 ± 2c and 55 ± 10%
relative humidity on a 12-h light/dark cycle. mice were fed
standard mouse chow (samyang ltd., incheon, korea) and
provided tap water ad libitum. all procedures were conducted in compliance with ‘‘guide for care and use of
animals’’ (chungbuk national university animal care
committee according to nih #86-23).

tissue preparation
mice were sacrificed under pentobarbital anesthesia. tissues were dissected and immediately frozen at –70c for
rna extraction. total rna was extracted from brain,
hypophysis, thyroid gland, thymus, heart, lung, liver,
spleen, kidney, adrenal glands, testes, epididymis, prostate
gland, pancreas, stomach, muscle, small intestine, and large
intestine. for hematoxylin and eosin staining and in situ
hybridization studies, organs were fixed with bouin’s
fixative for 24 h before sectioning.
total rna extraction and reverse transcription (rt)
total rna was isolated from mouse tissues using a trizol
reagent (invitrogen, ny, usa) according to the manufacturer’s manual. total rna concentration was determined by uv absorbance. five lg of total rna was
reverse transcribed using pd(n)6 primers and the first-strand
cdna synthesis reagents (amersham biosciences, uk).
real time-pcr
quantitative pcr reactions were performed using the
taqman universal pcr master mix kit (applied biosystems, ca, usa). amplification of  xxxg946xxx  cdna was
performed using a model 7500 real time pcr system by
assay on demand # mm00515041 (applied bioscience).
the taqman probe was fam labeled. each pcr program
started with ung (uracil-n-glycosylase) incubation at
50c for 2 min, followed by incubation at 95c for
10 min. reactions were 40 cycles using a denaturation
temperature of 95c for 15 s and an annealing and extension temperature of 60c for 1 min. data were acquired
and analyzed with a 7500 system sds software (version
1.3.1.21). amplification kinetics were recorded in real-time
mode as sigmoid process curves, for which the fluorescence was plotted against the number of amplification
cycles.  xxxg861xxx  mrna was used as an internal standard
(assay on demand #4352932e, applied bioscience) to
normalize expression of the target transcripts. relative
ratios of  xxxg946xxx  mrna to  xxxg861xxx  mrna, which precisely quantify the expression levels of target genes in
various tissues, were calculated using the standard curves.
data were analyzed for the duplicates of three independent
runs from 3 mice (means ± sd).
in situ hybridization
to prepare rna probes for in situ hybridization, a pcrii
vector (invitrogen, usa) containing a mouse  xxxg946xxx 
cdna clone (accession number: nm_008162, s1–as2
fragment; 461 bp) was linearized with bamhi or ecorv

restriction enzymes. digoxigenin (dig; roche, germany)labeled sense or antisense riboprobes for  xxxg946xxx  were
obtained by in vitro transcription in the presence of t7 or
sp6 rna polymerase (promega, usa) at 37c for
120 min. in situ hybridization for tissue sections was performed as described previously (baek et al. 2005). tissue
sections were placed on rnase-free glass slides and
deparaffinized. the sections were incubated in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) containing 10 lg/ml of proteinase k
at 37c for 10 min and treated with 4% paraformaldehyde
in pbs for 15 min, 0.2 m hcl for 10 min, and 0.25 %
acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine (ph 8.0) for
15 min. the hybridization reaction was carried out at 57c
for 17 h with 50 ll of hybridization mix on each section.
tissue sections were rinsed and incubated with fluoresceinconjugated anti-dig antibody diluted 1:2,000 in a blocking
agent (roche, germany) at 4c for 12 h. following washes
in pbs containing 0.2% tween 20, sections were
counterstained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide for nuclear staining
(sigma, usa). the slides were washed in pbs for 20 min
and coverslipped with gelvatol. slides were observed under
a confocal laser scanning microscope (bio-rad, usa).

expression level of  xxxg946xxx  mrna in tissues
as determined by quantitative rt-pcr,  xxxg946xxx  mrna
was expressed in all tissues studied (fig. 1). the highest
level of  xxxg946xxx  expression was found in testes, although
much lower levels were found in other reproductive tissues
(fig. 1). in neuronal tissues,  xxxg946xxx  mrna levels were

highest in the cerebrum and relatively lower in the cerebellum and hypophysis. in the gastrointestinal tract,
 xxxg946xxx  mrna was the highest level in the ileum, followed
by the stomach and jejunum (fig. 1). very low expression
was observed in the spleen and thymus (data not shown).
the rank order of  xxxg946xxx  mrna expression across the
tissues with the highest levels of expression was:
testes  heart > cerebrum ‡ ileum > stomach =
liver = jejunum ‡ epididymis.
cell- and tissue-specific localization of  xxxg946xxx  mrna
in the testes,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was observed in the leydig
cells and in spermatids and late spermatocytes at various
stages of spermatogenesis, whereas it was not detected in
spermatogonia and early spermatocytes (fig. 2a).  xxxg946xxx 
mrna was expressed in almost all areas of the cerebellum
examined, including the molecular layer, white matter, and
purkinje cell layer (fig. 2b). in the hypophysis,  xxxg946xxx 
mrna was expressed in the pituicytes of the neurohypophysis, but not in the adenohypophysis (fig. 2c). in the
thyroid, expression was primarily observed in parafollicular cells with comparably lower expression in basement
membrane of follicular cells (fig. 2d).  xxxg946xxx  mrna was
highly expressed in the smooth muscle cells of elastic
arteries (fig. 2e). in thymus,  xxxg946xxx  mrna expression
was detected in the cortex, but less so in the medulla
(fig. 2e).  xxxg946xxx  mrna appeared to be ubiquitously
expressed in the heart (fig. 2f).
in the lung,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was broadly expressed in
parenchyma of the lung (fig. 3a).  xxxg946xxx  mrna was
detected in cells of the parenchyma of the liver, including
hepatocytes and kupffer cells (fig. 3b). in spleen, low

levels of  xxxg946xxx  mrna were detected in the reticular
cells of red pulp, whereas no  xxxg946xxx  mrna was detected
in the lymphoid follicles of white pulp (fig. 3c). in
pancreas,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was primarily expressed in the
exocrine portion of the pancreas and in the epithelium of
intercalated and interlobular ducts, and was not expressed
in the islets of langherans (fig. 3d). in kidney,  xxxg946xxx 
mrna was more highly expressed in the tubular epithelium of the cortex than the medulla (fig. 3e). in the
epididymis,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was primarily expressed in
the ductular epithelium and smooth muscle cells (data not
shown).
in the forestomach of the gastrointestinal tract,  xxxg946xxx 
mrna was expressed in muscularis externa and keratinized surface epithelium of the mucosa (fig. 4a). relatively low expression of  xxxg946xxx  mrna was observed in
the mucosa and serosa layers of the duodenum, whereas
higher expression was observed in the jejunum and ileum,
particularly in the paneth cells (fig. 4b–d).  xxxg946xxx 
mrna was also detected in the mucosa and serosa layer of
colon (fig. 4e), and rectum (fig. 4f). in addition, there
were no apparent signals on the sections using dig-labeled
 xxxg946xxx  sense probe (data not shown).

discussion
free radicals and ros are byproducts of aerobic metabolism that, in sufficiently high amounts, can result in a state
of oxidative stress that is damaging to cells and tissues. a
number of studies have demonstrated that increased free
radical or ros production, or decreased antioxidant
defenses, are closely associated with alterations in gene
expression; an effect that is observed in several tissues
from phylogenetically diverse organisms (allen and balin
1988; rhee 1999). in this study, we found that although
 xxxg946xxx  mrna is widely expressed in most organs of
10-week-old male mice, cell- and tissue-specific expression
patterns of  xxxg946xxx  mrna exist.
quantitative rt-pcr showed that  xxxg946xxx  mrna levels
were approximately 100 times higher in testes than in
prostate. this is consistent with previous studies that have
shown that  xxxg946xxx  mrna levels were highest in the testes
of humans and rats (imai et al. 1995; diaconu et al. 2006).
together, these findings suggest that  xxxg946xxx  might have
functions in addition to its antioxidant potential in the
testes. in rats, testicular  xxxg946xxx  mrna levels are absent
after hypophysectomy and are partially restored by

gonadotropin treatment (roveri et al. 1992).  xxxg946xxx 
mrna expression in mouse testes is first observed at
3 weeks of age, highly increased at 8 weeks, and remains
high until mice are 80 weeks old. previous in situ evidence
has suggested that  xxxg946xxx  mrna was expressed stagespecifically during spermatogenesis (nam et al. 1998). in
this study,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was observed in late spermatocytes, spermatids, and interstitial leydig cells of the
testes, which supports the notion that  xxxg946xxx  plays an
essential role in male fertility. recently, we demonstrated
that estradiol could also increase  xxxg946xxx  mrna expression in male reproductive organs (nam et al. 2003).
the generation of  xxxd2298xxx  appears to be the
rate-limiting step in thyroid hormone synthesis and is
regulated through the action of  xxxd3368xxx  via a complex network of interacting, second-messenger systems (raspe et al. 1991; kimura et al. 1995). in
the present study,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was expressed in parafollicular cells and basement membrane of follicular cells
of the thyroid gland. these findings suggest that  xxxg946xxx 
might serve as a general regulator of endocrine activity
(e.g., in the testes and thyroid).
in mice, ros are detected in brain regions and specific
neuronal cells (quick and dugan 2001). oxidative stress

and the generation of ros are strongly implicated in a
number of neuronal diseases, including stroke and
cerebrovascular disease, alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s
disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (loh et al. 2006).
the brain consumes a disproportionate amount (20%) of
the body’s oxygen for its relatively small weight (2%), it is
enriched in readily peroxidizable  xxxd2154xxx , and it is not
particularly enriched in antioxidant defenses (floyd and
carney 1992). in addition some parts of the brain such as
the cerebellum are specifically susceptible to oxidative
stress inducers such as methyl mercury (sarafian and
verity 1991). previous studies have shown that  xxxg946xxx 
mrna is expressed in developing mouse brain (schneider
et al. 2006) and is predominantly localized in the inner
membrane of mitochondria in rat brain (panfili et al. 1991).
here we show that  xxxg946xxx  mrna is highly expressed in
the molecular and purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum.
these findings suggest that  xxxg946xxx  might act as an
important antioxidant in the brain.
in this study,  xxxg946xxx  was also highly expressed in the
smooth muscle cells of arteries, lung, and epididymis. in
humans, low plasma se levels have been associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including
coronary atherosclerosis. in addition, endothelial cells of

human coronary artery that are pretreated with sodium
selenite at low doses (5–40 nm) have been shown to be
more resistant to oxidative damage induced by t-butyl
hydroperoxide or photogenerated oxidized low-density
lipoprotein than cells grown in se-deficient medium
(miller et al. 2001). smooth muscle cells are known to take
up oxidized ldl by a particular receptor referred to as the
scavenger receptor (pitas 1990). overexpression of  xxxg946xxx 
inhibits hydroperoxide-induced oxidation and affects oxidized ldl-mediated proliferation of smooth muscle cells
(brigelius-flohe et al., 2000). these findings strongly
support the notion that  xxxg946xxx  modulates lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in smooth muscle cells.
the expression of  xxxg946xxx  mrna in the tubular epithelium of renal cortex was higher than that in the medulla.
also,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was diffusely expressed in the
parenchyma of the liver, including hepatocytes and kupffer
cells. ischemia-reperfusion (ir) injury is a multifactorial
process triggered when the liver or other organs are transiently subjected to reduced blood supply followed by
reperfusion. ir injury often damages the hepatocyte and
sinusoidal endothelial cells in the liver (selzner et al. 2003)
and the proximal convoluted tubules of kidney (aragno

123

et al. 2003). these results suggest that  xxxg946xxx  might be
involved in the body’s response to ir injury
in this study,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was primarily expressed in
the muscularis externa and the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the stomach. recently, we demonstrated that in mouse embryos, cgpx mrna was expressed
in the glandular region and surface epithelium of the
stomach and intestinal villae of the small intestines (baek
et al. 2005). damage in the mucosal epithelium can result
in a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea and electrolytic imbalance (potten and loeffler 1990). in the gastrointestinal tract, ros-induced endothelial dysfunction is
considered to be an important cellular mechanism in
indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal injury (yoshikawa
et al. 1993), as well as in the colonic inflammation
associated with ulcerative colitis (sedghi et al. 1993).
drew et al. (2005) reported that cgpx was ubiquitously
distributed in the colon with the exception of the luminal
epithelium, where  xxxg944xxx  was expressed. in this study,
 xxxg946xxx  mrna was ubiquitously expressed in the intestines, including the luminal epithelium. also,  xxxg946xxx  was
highly expressed in the paneth cells of the jejunum and the
ileum. paneth cells are pyramidal epithelial cells found at

j mol hist (2007) 38:237–244

the base of the crypts of lieberkühn in the small intestines.
these cells can be distinguished by their large, eosinophilic
secretory granules. it is well known that degranulation of
paneth cells provides protection against ingested infectious
microbes. paneth cell granules contain a variety of
antimicrobial peptides and proteins, including lysozyme
(mason and taylor 1975) and secretory  xxxg1759xxx 
(harwig et al. 1995) that are commonly recognized as
important effectors of intestinal immunity. future studies
to further define the function and regulation of  xxxg946xxx  in
paneth cells will enhance our understanding of normal
small intestine physiology and will likely contribute to a
better understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory
and infectious diseases of the intestine.
in conclusion,  xxxg946xxx  mrna was expressed in all
mouse tissues studied. particularly high levels of expression were observed in the testes, brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract; tissues that would be expected to be
exposed to high levels of ros and free radicals. these
results suggest that  xxxg946xxx  plays a role as antioxidant
enzyme in most tissues of male mice. further studies will
likely clarify the precise relationship between expression of
 xxxg946xxx  and ros-mediated cell dysfunction or damage.
