involvement of the  xxxg1805xxx  in regulating long-chain acyl-coa thioesterases.  long-chain acyl-coa thioesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-coas to the corresponding free fatty acid and coa. we recently cloned four members of a novel multi-gene family of peroxisome proliferator-induced genes encoding cytosolic (cte-i), mitochondrial (mte-i), and peroxisomal (pte-ia and pte-ib) acyl-coa thioesterases (hunt et al. 1999. j. biol. chem. 274: 34317-34326). as the  xxxg1805xxx  ( xxxg1805xxx ) plays a central role in regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism, we examined the involvement of this receptor in regulation of the thioesterases, particularly cte-i and mte-i. northern blot analysis shows that the induction of these thioesterases by  xxxd1724xxx  is mediated through a strictly  xxxg1805xxx -dependent mechanism. all four acyl-coa thioesterases are induced at mrna level by fasting and using  xxxg1805xxx -null mice, it is evident that the increase in cte-i due to fasting is mainly independent of the  xxxg1805xxx  in liver and heart. the cte-i gene responds rapidly to fasting, with induction of mrna and protein evident after 6 h. this fasting effect is rapidly reversible, with cte-i mrna returning almost to control levels after 3 h refeeding, and being further repressed to 20% of control after 9 h refeeding. although cte-i mrna shows a low basal expression in liver, it can be suppressed 90% by feeding a fat-free diet. these data demonstrate that the nutritional regulation of the thioesterases involves the  xxxg1805xxx  and other signaling pathways responsible for activation and repression. putative physiological functions for the acyl-coa thioesterases are discussed.
