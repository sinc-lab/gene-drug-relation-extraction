context: a common haplotype of the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) gene has been associated with
increased susceptibility to coronary heart disease (chd). whether this haplotype predisposes to
heart failure (hf) is unknown.
objective: the objective of the study was to determine whether gr haplotype 3 is associated with
hf and whether this association is explained by low-grade inflammation ( xxxg520xxx ).
design: in a prospective cohort study, participants were genotyped for common gr gene polymorphisms (er22/23ek, bcli c/g, n363s, 9␤ a/g). haplotype analyses were conducted.
setting: the study was conducted at one university medical center, two veterans affairs medical
centers, and nine public health clinics.
patients: patients included 526 white outpatients with stable chd.
main outcome measures: echocardiographic evidence of ventricular dysfunction, self-reported
heart failure, and subsequent hospitalization for heart failure were measured.
results: after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and body mass index, participants with two copies
of haplotype 3 were more likely than those with 0 or 1 copy to report heart failure [hazard ratio
(hr) 4.15, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.5–11.3, p ⬍ 0.01], have systolic dysfunction (left ventricular
ejection fraction ⬍50%) (hr 3.0, 95% ci 0.9 –9.9, p ⫽ 0.07), and be hospitalized for hf during a mean
follow-up of 6 yr (hr 3.0, 95% ci 1.3–7.0, p ⫽ 0.01). these associations were attenuated after
adjustment for higher  xxxg520xxx  levels in patients with two copies of haplotype 3.
conclusions: we found that the gr gene haplotype 3 was associated with prevalent hf, systolic
dysfunction, and subsequent hf hospitalization in patients with chd. this association was partly
mediated by low-grade inflammation. (j clin endocrinol metab 95: 2885–2891, 2010)

a

s mortality from coronary heart disease (chd) improves in the acute setting, improving care and outcomes for those with stable chd assumes greater importance for public health. avoiding hospitalization for heart
failure (hf) is an important goal for this population, and

understanding predictors of hf is the first step toward
targeted prevention measures. hf appears to result not
only from cardiac overload or injury but also from a complex interplay among genetic, neurohormonal, inflammatory, and biochemical alterations (1).

(1).  xxxg520xxx  (crp), a plasma protein synthesized by the liver, is a sensitive and dynamic systemic
marker of inflammation. its concentration in the circulation can increase by up to 10,000-fold during acute responses to serious infection or major tissue damage. longterm circulating concentrations of crp show a similar
year-to-year consistency within individuals to levels of
some more extensively studied risk factors such as blood
cholesterol concentration and blood pressure. in recent
years, crp has been studied as a potential marker of more
subtle and persistent systemic alterations that may be
loosely called low-grade inflammation.
in this study, we sought to examine the association of
gr gene haplotype 3 with self-reported hf, ventricular
dysfunction, and subsequent hf hospitalization and determine the extent to which any association between haplotype 3 and hf was explained by low-grade inflammation. we evaluated a sample of 526 white patients with
stable chd who were enrolled in the heart and soul
study. based on previous reports, we hypothesized that

individual haplotype assignments for the four polymorphisms were estimated using phase (17). only haplotypes with
a frequency greater than 1% were included in the analyses. linkage disequilibrium among the four variants was expressed as d⬘
and r2 using haploview (massachusetts institute of technology/
harvard broad institute, cambridge, ma). for each haplotype,
three combinations were distinguished as carrying no, one, or
two copies of the haplotype as in previous studies (8, 18).

crp
participants were instructed to fast for 12 h (except for medication, which they were able to take with water) and not to smoke
for 5 h before their study appointment. plasma and serum samples
were stored at ⫺70 c for measurement of crp. the laboratory
technicians who assayed the inflammatory markers were blinded to
the results of genotyping and hf. we used the integra high-sensitivity assay (roche, indianapolis, in) or (owing to a change in the
laboratory) the extended range assay (beckman, palo alto, ca) to
measure crp as described previously (19). results from these two
assays were highly correlated (r ⫽ 0.99 in 185 participants). the
roche integra high-sensitivity crp assay has an interassay coefficient of variation of 3.2%, and the lowest detectable measurement
of this assay is 0.25 mg/liter. the beckman extended range highsensitivity crp assay has an interassay coefficient of variation of
less than 6.7%, an intraassay coefficient of variation of less than
6.2%, and a reportable range of 0.20 –1140 mg/liter.

il-6
il-6 is a  xxxg1173xxx  produced by t cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and other cells. one of its main functions is to stimulate
synthesis of plasma proteins involved in acute phase responses. we
used the quantikine hs il-6 immunoassay (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) to determine the concentration of il-6 from edta
plasma. the interassay coefficient of variation is 6.5–9.6%, and the
intraassay coefficient of variation is 6.9 –7.8%.

twenty-four-hour urinary cortisol
details regarding collecting 24-h urinary cortisol have been
published previously (20). in brief, patients were instructed to
collect all urine for 24 h between the end of their study appointment and the time when a researcher visited their house the next
day. research personnel arrived at patient homes exactly 24 h
after their appointment to ensure accurately timed specimens
and enhance compliance with the protocol. if subjects were unable to collect all urine for any reason or had urinary incontinence, their samples were deemed inadequate and no urinary
cortisol data were recorded for these subjects.

diastolic and systolic function
at baseline, all participants underwent resting echocardiography using an acuson sequoia ultrasound system (mountain view,
ca). we obtained standard two-dimensional views and performed
planimetry with a computerized digitization system to determine
left ventricular ejection fraction. we categorized participants as
having diastolic dysfunction if their mitral inflow ratio of peak early-to-late diastolic filling velocity was more than 0.75 and if the
velocity time integral in their pulmonary vein was greater during
diastole than during systole (21). systolic dysfunction was defined
as a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%.

hf
baseline
self-reported heart failure was determined by asking participants, “has a doctor or nurse had ever told you that you have
congestive heart failure?”

follow-up
we conducted annual telephone follow-up interviews with
participants (or their proxy) to ask about hospitalizations. if any
participant or proxy reported a hospitalization, we retrieved the
medical records, and they were reviewed by two independent and
blinded physician adjudicators. if both adjudicators agreed on
the outcome classification, it was binding. if there was disagreement, they conferred, reconsidered their classification, and requested consultation from a third, blinded adjudicator as necessary. the outcome of interest, hf hospitalization, was defined
as hospitalization for a clinical syndrome with more than two of
the following: paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, increased jugular venous pressure, pulmonary rales, third heart
sound, cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, or pulmonary edema on
chest x-ray, as determined by the adjudicators from reviewing
medical records. these clinical signs and symptoms must have
represented a clear change from the normal clinical state of the
patient and been accompanied by either failing cardiac output or
peripheral or pulmonary edema. in addition to all the hospital
records, supportive documentation of decreased cardiac index,
increasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreasing oxygen saturation, and end-organ hypoperfusion, if available, were
included in adjudication (11).

other variables
age, sex, smoking, and medical history were determined by
self-report. body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. the waist circumference was measured midway between the lower rib margin
and the iliac crest. the hip circumference was measured at the
level of the greater trochanters. the waist to hip ratio (whr)
was calculated as the waist circumference divided by the hip
circumference. participants were instructed to bring their medication bottles to the study appointment, and study personnel
recorded all current medications. medications were categorized
using epocrates rx (san mateo, ca).

statistical analysis
the goals of this study were to examine the association of gr
gene haplotype 3 with self-reported hf, ventricular dysfunction,
and subsequent hf hospitalization and evaluate the extent to
which the association between haplotype 3 and hf is explained
by low-grade inflammation (crp). because the proportion of
participants with the combined hf outcome (systolic dysfunction, self-reported hf, or hf hospitalization) was identical in
patients with no or one copy of haplotype 3, we combined these
into one group for the analyses.
differences in baseline characteristics between patients with
two copies of gr gene haplotype 3 and those who had no or one
copy were compared using univariate anova for continuous
variables and ␹2 tests for dichotomous variables. crp and il-6
were log transformed because they did not have a normal
distribution. we used ␹2 tests to examine the distribution of
established crp cutoff categories indicating low (ⱕ3 mg/li-

cardiovascular risk (22) among carriers of no, one, and two
copies of haplotype 3.
we used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for the
cross-sectional association of haplotype 3 status with self-reported hf and ventricular dysfunction. we estimated the risk of
hf hospitalization associated with gr haplotype 3 using cox
proportional hazards models. we computed odds ratios and hazard ratios with 95% confidence interval in multivariate models:
unadjusted (model 1), adjusted for age and sex (model 2), adjusted for model 2 and body mass index (model 3), adjusted for
model 3 and smoking (model 4), and adjusted for model 4 and
low-grade inflammation (crp). we tested for interactions of
haplotype 3 with age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and crp.
all analyses were performed using statistical analysis software (version 9; sas institute, cary, nc).

results
among the 595 white participants, successful genotyping
for all four polymorphisms was achieved (and haplotypes
estimated) in 526 participants. reasons for missing genotypes included nonavailability of dna and genotyping
errors. the genotype distributions for the four polymorphisms did not deviate significantly from hardy-weinberg-equilibrium (all p ⬎ 0.4).
haplotypes
the observed haplotype structure (fig. 1) corresponded to those previously reported (5, 8, 9, 23–25). the

haplotype with the highest frequency (haplotype 1,
41.4%) consisted of the major alleles of the four singlenucleotide polymorphisms (snps). haplotype 2 (34.8%)
was characterized by the minor g allele of the bcli polymorphism. three of the four polymorphisms were found
to be mutually exclusive; only the minor codon 23 a allele
was always present in combination with the minor 9␤ g
allele (haplotype 4, 3.8%). however, the g allele of the
exon 9␤ snp was also observed independently from
er22/23ek (haplotype 3, 17.9%). the minor a allele of
the n363s snp was present in haplotype 5 (2.1%).
characteristics of participants
of the 526 participants, 17 had two copies of haplotype
3, 154 had one copy, and 355 had no copies. as compared
with homozygous carriers, those with no or one copy of
haplotype 3 had similar baseline characteristics with the
exception of smoking and the possible exception of higher
body mass index and whr (table 1). patients with two
copies of the haplotype 3 risk allele also had higher log
crp levels (table 1). this association persisted after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking
(1.4 ⫾ 0.31 vs. 0.70 ⫾ 0.06; p ⫽ 0.03).
furthermore, the distribution of established crp
cutoff categories indicating low (ⱕ3 mg/liter), moderate (⬍3 and ⬍10 mg/liter), and high (⬎10 mg/l) cardiovascular risk differed among genotypes (␹2 test, p ⫽
0.02, fig. 2).

haplotype 3 was associated with numerically but nonsignificantly higher 24-h urinary cortisol levels (table 1,

hf
among homozygous haplotype 3 carriers, eight of 17
(47%) had self-reported hf compared with 82 of 509
(16%) of those who had no or one copy of haplotype 3
(fig. 3 and table 2). furthermore, four of 17 of homozygotes (24%) presented with systolic dysfunction according to echocardiography compared with 52 of 509 (10%)
of those not homozygous for haplotype 3 (fig. 3 and table

when outcomes were combined, participants homozygous for haplotype 3 had a 4-fold increased odds of developing any hf outcome (self-reported heart failure, ventricular dysfunction, hospitalization for heart failure) (fig.
3 and table 2).
supplemental table 1 depicts the results separately for
each group (two copies of haplotype 3 vs. one copy, two

role of crp
after adjustment for higher crp levels among patients
with two copies of the haplotype 3 allele, the association
of haplotype 3 with self-reported hf, systolic dysfunction,
and subsequent hospitalization for hf was partly attenuated (table 2).

discussion
in a prospective cohort study of white patients with stable
chd, we found that having two copies of the gr gene
haplotype 3 was associated with self-reported hf, systolic
dysfunction, and subsequent hospitalization for hf during 6 yr of follow-up. after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and body mass index, participants with two copies of
haplotype 3 were three to four times more likely to have
hf than those with no or one copy. the association between gr haplotype 3 and hf appeared to be at least
partly explained by greater low-grade inflammation in patients with two copies of haplotype 3.
previous studies found that gr haplotype 3 increases
the risk of chd, but the association between gr haplotype 3 and hf has not been previously evaluated. the
rotterdam study demonstrated an increased risk of chd
and myocardial infarction for gr haplotype 3 homozygotes in a population-based sample (8). another recent
study showed that gr haplotype 3 is associated with chd
in men with  xxxg1318xxx  (9). our findings add to this growing literature by demonstrating that
the risk of hf associated with being homozygous for gr
haplotype 3 is of a comparable magnitude with other established cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes (26).
furthermore, we replicated findings from the rotterdam study of increased crp in homozygotes of gr haplotype 3. thus, it seems likely that the mechanism by
which gr haplotype 3 increases risk for chd and hf
includes inflammatory processes. indeed, in our study the
association between gr haplotype 3 and hf was markedly reduced after adjustment for crp.

the 9␤ g allele, present in haplotype 3, is a plausible
candidate for increased inflammatory activity because it
leads to relative glucocorticoid resistance, i.e. reduced glucocorticoid sensitivity. this has been shown by functional
studies that revealed a stabilizing effect of this variant on
gr␤ mrna in vitro, possibly leading to enhanced expression of gr␤ protein (27). gr␤ is one of several gr
protein isoforms and is generated through an alternative
splicing pathway. in contrast to the functionally active and
most abundant isoform gr␣ (28), gr␤ is unable to bind
ligand and is transcriptionally inactive.
consistent with the hypothesis of glucocorticoid resistance associated with polymorphism 9␤ a/g, i.e. diminished glucocorticoid sensitivity, two studies found an association between this polymorphism and lower blood
pressure in european-americans (29) and a smaller whr
and more favorable lipid profile in european women (30).
there is now ample evidence that glucocorticoids can have
unfavorable effects on metabolism and blood pressure (2).
thus, a more favorable lipid profile and body composition
is a plausible result of reduced glucocorticoid sensitivity.
however, including our findings, three studies have now
independently demonstrated an increased risk for cardiovascular disease associated with haplotype 3 in a population-based sample, in men with  xxxg1318xxx  and in patients with chronic chd (8, 9). thus, it
appears that the disadvantage of increased inflammatory
activity associated with relative glucocorticoid resistance
through the 9␤ a/g polymorphism outweigh potential
beneficial effects on metabolism, blood pressure, and body
composition.
several limitations should be considered. only 17 participants in our sample were homozygous for haplotype 3,
limiting our power to detect small to medium effects. we
did not find an association of haplotype 3 with 24-h urinary cortisol secretion, although homozygous haplotype 3
carriers had numerically greater values.
our results were obtained in white participants with
existing coronary heart disease, 85% of them being males.

thus, we cannot exclude that our results may not be applicable to other populations. it is noteworthy that one of
the earlier studies found an association of haplotype 3
with chd in men but not women (9). furthermore, a
sex-specific effect of the 9␤ a/g polymorphism was found
in basal cortisol values (31) and the cortisol response to
psychosocial stress (24). again, in men, but not women,
carriers of the 9␤ a/g polymorphism displayed greater
basal cortisol and greater cortisol responses to stress compared with noncarriers. it appears that the 9␤ a/g polymorphism has stronger effects in men compared with
women. future studies should systematically explore sex
effects of the 9␤ a/g polymorphism. sensitivity to glucocorticoid differs not only among individuals but also in
different tissues (muscle, fat, liver, brain, etc.). therefore,
a limitation of our study is that we did not perform ex vivo
studies examining differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity
among several tissues.
in summary, we found that a common haplotype of the
gr gene, which includes the minor allele of the 9␤ a/g
polymorphism (haplotype 3), is associated with hf. the
association between gr haplotype 3 and hf was partly
mediated by crp. thus, variation in the glucocorticoid
receptor gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of hf,
presumably involving inflammatory processes.
