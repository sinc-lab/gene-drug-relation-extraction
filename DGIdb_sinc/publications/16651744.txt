ginkgetin, a biflavonoid from  xxxd2199xxx  leaves (ginkgoaceae), was previously demonstrated to inhibit
 xxxg1759xxx  and to suppress proinflammatory gene expression such as  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) and
 xxxg1578xxx . in this study, the effects of ginkgetin were examined on an animal model of
chronic skin inflammation and proinflammatory gene expression. when topically applied to icr mouse ear,
ginkgetin (20—80 m g/ear/treatment) inhibited ear edema (22.8—30.5%) and  xxxd1903xxx  production
(30.2—31.1%) induced by multiple treatment of  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa) for 7 consecutive
days. by histological comparison, ginkgetin was also found to reduce epidermal hyperplasia. the expression of
proinflammatory gene, interleukin-1b , was suppressed by ginkgetin. from the results, it is suggested that
ginkgetin may be beneficial against chronic skin inflammatory disorders like atopic dermatitis.

although the etiology of chronic skin inflammatory disorders including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (ad) is not
clearly understood, many studies have shown that various
proinflammatory enzymes/cytokines play an important role
in these inflammatory diseases. for example, phospholipase
a2 (pla2) was highly expressed in some psoriatic tissues.1)
in addition to lipoxygenase products,2) cyclooxygenase
(cox) and prostaglandins (pg) were involved in dermal inflammation and skin wound healing.3,4) moreover, it was
found that high concentrations of cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor (tnf)-a , and adhesion molecules, including
intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1, were deeply involved in the regional site of chronic skin inflammation.5,6)
recent studies have also indicated that inducible  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase (inos) may be associated with psoriasis, and its
reaction product, no, is involved in various skin disorders.7,8)
therefore, it is reasonably thought that an interference of
activity and/or expression of these proinflammatory molecules may result in attenuation of chronic skin inflammatory
syndromes, and the agents acting on these points may give
beneficial effects.
biflavonoids are flavonoid–flavonoid dimers and some
of them possess anti-inflammatory activity. for instance, several biflavonoids including amentoflavone, ginkgetin and
isoginkgetin inhibited histamine release.9) amentoflavone
and tetrahydroamentoflavone were found to inhibit cox-1
and/or cox-2.10,11) some biflavonoids were revealed to suppress the expression of proinflammatory molecules such as
cox-2 and inos.12,13) these previous investigations have
shown the potential of certain biflavonoids for anti-inflammatory agents. in particular, ginkgetin (fig. 1) mainly found in
 xxxd2199xxx  leaves (ginkgoaceae) was previously demonstrated as an inhibitor of group iia  xxxg1760xxx  inhibitor14) and
cpla2.15) in addition, ginkgetin was reported to suppress
cox-2 expression from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-treated
macrophages without affecting cox-2 activity, and in vivo
study has also revealed that ginkgetin inhibited cox-2
expression and pge2 production from mouse skin induced
by 3-d treatment of  xxxd2925xxx

(tpa).16) all these findings strongly suggest that ginkgetin
may show an inhibition against inflammatory disorders, especially skin inflammation by topical application. thus, for
further characterization of the pharmacological property, the
effects of ginkgetin were examined on an animal model of
chronic skin inflammation and proinflammatory gene expression in the present investigation.
materials and methods
chemicals tpa and prednisolone were obtained from
sigma-aldrich co. (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.). ginkgetin was
isolated from the methanol extract of  xxxd2199xxx  leaves
according to the previously described procedure.17) the purity was 95% based on hplc analysis.
animals male icr mice (4 weeks, specific pathogenfree) were obtained from orient co. (korea). animals were
fed with laboratory chow (purina korea) and water ad libitum. they were acclimatized in an animal facility (knu)
under the conditions of 20—22 °c, 40—60% relative humidity and 12 h/12 h (light/dark) cycle at least 7 d prior to experiment.
chronic skin inflammation on day of the experiment
(day 1), tpa (1 m g/20 m l acetone) was applied to the inner
and outer surfaces of mouse ear for inducing a chronic type
of skin inflammation according to the original procedure18)
with some modification. test compounds dissolved in oilbased vehicle were topically applied to the same site (20 m l)
at 1 and 12 h after tpa treatment. tpa-treated control group
only received tpa and vehicle. on day 2—6, the same treat-

ment regimen was carried out with tpa and test compounds.
on day 7, tpa was applied, and one hour later, test compounds were treated. three randomly selected mice/group
were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 3 h after final treatment of test compounds. ears were removed and stored in
rna stabilization reagent (qiagen, germany) at 20 °c for
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
analysis. for determination of anti-inflammatory activity, ear
thickness of the remaining five mice/group was measured
using an engineering gauge (mitutoyo, japan) 5 h after final
treatment of test compounds. immediately after, in order to
determine pge2 concentration and to prepare histological
samples, ears were removed. for evaluation of the effects on
normal skin, test compounds in the vehicle were treated topically to ears of mice using the same treatment schedule as
above without tpa treatment. in this case, the control group
received acetone and vehicle only. after 7 d, ear thickness of
the test compound-treated groups was measured, but no
noticeable difference was observed between the treated and
the control groups.
rt-pcr analysis after cutting into small pieces, ear
samples were homogenized in rlt buffer containing 1%
b - xxxd26xxx  for 30 s using polytron homogenizer.
total rna was extracted using rneasy mini kit (qiagen) according to the supplier’s protocol. the concentration of rna
content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260
and 280 nm. cdnas were synthesized using rt reaction at
42 °c, 50 min and 99 °c, 5 min in gene cycler thermal cycler (bio-rad). primers were synthesized on the basis of the
repeated mouse cdna sequence for cox-1, cox-2, interleukin-1b (il-1b ),  xxxg2296xxx  , inos, icam-1, fibronectin and
g3pdh. the primer sequences used for pcr were as follows: cox-1 sense, 5-tgc atg tgg ctg tgg atg

bromide staining for 10 min. the band density was quantified
by densitometric scanning using sigmagel (version 1.0, jandel sci.). the signal intensities were normalized by comparison with that of g3pdh and represented as relative ratios.

cedure.16) in brief, the biopsies were obtained by 4 mm punch
from four randomly selected ear samples/group. then, they
were homogenized in 100 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm edta and 10 m m indomethacin. after centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 min, 50 mm of citrate buffer (ph 3.5)
was added to the supernatant. the mixture was centrifuged
again at 2500 g for 10 min. the resulting supernatant was applied to a 6 ml sep-pak c18 cartridge (waters associate,
u.s.a.) and eluted with 5 ml ethyl acetate containing 1%
methanol. the eluent was dried under n2 stream and pge2
concentration was measured with an elisa kit (cayman
chem.) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
histology ear samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with
haematoxylin and eosin (h&e) based on the standard procedures.
statistical analysis all results were represented as
arithmetic means.d. one-way anova and student’s
t-tests were used for evaluation of a statistical significance.
results
seven day multiple treatment of tpa on icr mouse ear
induced a chronic type of skin inflammation, characterized
by edema, epidermal hyperplasia and infiltration of inflammatory cells (figs. 2a, b). by histological comparison,
ginkgetin was found to considerably reduce these responses
(fig. 2c). prednisolone used as a reference drug reduced
these responses more profoundly (fig. 2d). when the ear
thickness was measured, more than twice increase was observed compared with those of non-treated mice (0.475
0.031 mm from 0.2060.005 mm) (fig. 3). by topical application, ginkgetin significantly inhibited ear edema (22.8,
30.5% inhibition at 20, 80 m g/ear/treatment, respectively)
(fig. 3a). prednisolone (10 m g/ear/treatment) showed potent
inhibition of ear edema (66.3%). using the ear biopsies, pg
levels were checked. as expected, tpa treatment drastically
increased pge2 concentration in the lesion (24.82.1 ng/
biopsy) from the basal level (3.40.3 ng/biopsy). ginkgetin
moderately reduced pge2 concentration (30.2—31.1%),
while prednisolone showed a slightly higher inhibition of
pge2 production (36.5%).
for elucidating the effects on proinflammatory gene expression, rt-pcr was employed using the ear biopsies. tpa
treatment considerably induced the expression of cox-2 and
il-1b genes (fig. 4). other inducible genes of icam-1 and
 xxxg2296xxx  were very weakly induced whereas inos mrna was
not detected. the constitutive genes, cox-1 and fibronectin,
were constantly expressed as expected, but there was some
increase of mrna expression by 7-d tpa treatment. under
this condition, ginkgetin dose-dependently inhibited il-1b
expression among the inducible genes tested, but not statistically significant (16.6, 50.9% inhibition at low and high dose
treatment, respectively). cox-2 expression was weakly
reduced only by high dose treatment of ginkgetin (13.7% inhibition). the changes of icam-1 and  xxxg2296xxx  gene expression by ginkgetin were not meaningful since expression levels of these two genes were too low. on the other hand, prednisolone potently inhibited cox-2 and il-1b expression
(75.7, 95.7% inhibition, respectively).
for toxicity evaluation, ginkgetin was applied to the dorsal

area of skh-1 hairless mice (400 m g/mouse/d, 5 d a week).
after 3 months, any apparent toxicity including appearance
difference and differences of body weights and major organ
weights was not found (data not shown). all these findings
indicate that ginkgetin possesses inhibitory activity against
chronic skin inflammation and may be safely used in long-

this investigation has clearly proven that ginkgetin inhibited the inflammatory responses of an animal model of
chronic skin inflammation. depending on animal models of
skin inflammation employed, there are substantial differences
in the nature of inflammation produced. for instance, phenoltreated contact dermatitis in mice produced an acute inflammation accompanied by dermal edema, and an animal model
of delayed hypersensitivity induced an infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lesion.19,20) multiple tpa treatment used
in this study, on the other hand, provoked the characteristic
changes such as edema and epidermal keratinocyte proliferation. these results were well matched with other’s finding.21)
in particular, ginkgetin reduced the epidermal hyperplasia.
previously, it was found that multiple treatment of tpa for
3 consecutive days (3-d model) potently induced several
proinflammatory genes including cox-2, il-1b ,  xxxg2296xxx  and
icam-1 on icr mouse ear.22) compared to 3-d model,
cox-2 mrna expression was weaker, and the degree of
cox-2 and il-1b expression had larger variation within the
animals of the same group. the expression levels of icam-1
and  xxxg2296xxx  expression were minimum in 7-d model, while
il-1b gene expression was prominent on both models. it is
thought that a shift to chronic response in 7-d model from 3d model may provide these changes, suggesting that il-1b
expression is likely more important than those of cox-2,
icam-1 and  xxxg2296xxx  . ginkgetin was found to inhibit il-1b
expression. however, it is not certain why there was some increase of cox-1 and fibronectin mrna levels by tpa treat-

needs to be further elucidated.
to present, there is a difficulty to successfully treat chronic
skin inflammatory disorders. therefore, it is desirable to develop anti-inflammatory agents having different cellular action mechanism(s) from those of conventional drugs such as
topical steroids. in this respect, ginkgetin has a potential for
new anti-inflammatory agent since this compound is a multifunctional agent, attenuating proinflammatory gene expression as well as inhibiting pla2. ginkgetin may be beneficial
against chronic skin inflammatory disorders such as ad by
topical application.

ment with/without ginkgetin.
especially, on 3-d model, ginkgetin clearly reduced cox2 induction and pge2 production in the skin lesion.22) on the
contrary, in the present 7-d model, ginkgetin did not show
the meaningful reduction of cox-2 expression. furthermore,
ginkgetin was previously found to show no effect on cox-1
and cox-2 activities.16) therefore, an inhibition of cox-2
expression or cox activity may not be responsible for the reduction of pge2 concentration by ginkgetin treatment. instead, it is speculated that the some reduction of pge2 concentration may be at least partly due to pla2 inhibition
and/or inhibition of il-1b expression by ginkgetin. this
speculation may be supported by the previous finding that the
certain biflavonoids including ginkgetin were revealed as
pla2 inhibitors.14,15,23) it is also known that il-1b enhances
prostanoid production.24,25) but the detailed mechanism
