endocrine therapy is first-line therapy for patients with  xxxg730xxx —positive or  xxxg1737xxx —positive metastatic breast cancer. commonly
used endocrine therapies are tamoxifen,  xxxd2557xxx  acetate, and aromatase
inhibitors. although tamoxifen and  xxxd2557xxx  acetate have a favorable thera-
peutic profile, there are risks associated with these agents. with tamoxifen, the
partial agonist property can lead to thromboembolic events. an important
adverse event of  xxxd2557xxx  acetate is weight gain and fluid retention in some
patients. the aromatase inhibitors are currently used as second-line therapy
after tamoxifen failure. a recent study showed that anastrozole, an aromatase
inhibitor, is as effective or even superior to tamoxifen when used as a first-line
therapy. however, not all patients will respond to currently available therapies.
a new class of drug, the  xxxg730xxx  downregulators, has been devel-
oped.  xxxd2165xxx , the first agent in this new class, not only induces the degra-
dation of the  xxxg730xxx  but also is an estrogen antagonist; further, its
lack of agonist activity provides a better safety profile. two phase ill trials have
proven that  xxxd2165xxx  is at least as effective as anastrozole in postmenopausal
women with advanced breast cancer.  xxxd2165xxx  is an effective and safe
endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women who have failed prior endocrine

therapy.

 

ge introduction

of response to endocrine therapy is the presence of estrogen

n patients with breast cancer, the most important predictor
receptors (er) on the tumor. the majority of breast

tumors are er-positive (er+).! progesterone receptors (pgr)
are also important because a minor percentage of tumors are
pgr-positive (pgr+) even though er cannot be detected.
research has shown that er and pgr status can predict
response to endocrine therapy (table 1).?2 patients whose

tumors are positive for both er and pgr have the greatest like-
lihood of responding to endocrine therapy. in patients with
metastatic disease that is er+ or pgr+ and not aggressive,
especially those who are asymptomatic and/or elderly,
endocrine therapy is the preferred first-line therapy of
choice.34 because patients who initially responded to one
endocrine agent and have subsequent disease progression may
still respond to another agent from a different class,>'° a trial
of sequential endocrine therapy may be used before initiating
chemotherapy. commonly used endocrine therapies in
sequential treatments include tamoxifen,  xxxd2557xxx  acetate,
and aromatase inhibitors (als).

tamoxifen

tamoxifen is one of the most widely used selective estrogen
receptor modulators (serms). rather than decreasing the cir-
culating levels of estrogen, tamoxifen inhibits its activity.!!
tamoxifen is considered to be the agent of choice in both pre-
menopausal and postmenopausal women with hormone recep-
tor-positive metastatic breast cancer.!? a prospective study of
nearly 400 women showed that menopausal status and the
presence or absence of er or pgr determined whether the dis-
ease would respond well to tamoxifen.!3 premenopausal
women with er+ tumors had an overall response rate (or,
defined as complete response [cr], partial response [pr], or
stable disease [sd] for greater than 6 months) of 24%, versus
an 86% response rate among postmenopausal women whose
tumors were strongly positive for er and pgr. women with
er+/pgr— tumors had a slight but still significant and clin-
ically substantial benefit.'%

tamoxifen, like the other serms  xxxd3402xxx  and ralox-
ifene, is a partial agonist of the receptor in certain other tissues,
particularly bone, liver, and endometrium. this partial estro-
genic activity has both beneficial and detrimental conse-
quences. tamoxifen has been shown to increase or at least
density in

women, !*:!5 and has a favorable effect on serum lipids.!° some

maintain bone mineral postmenopausal
trials have demonstrated a lower incidence of cardiovascular
events among patients receiving tamoxifen!”!8; however, the
breast cancer prevention trial (bcpt)!° did not corroborate
this finding. although a rare finding, tamoxifen is associated
with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events!??°

(relative risk 1.5 to 3.2 in the bcpt). thromboembolism is

endocrine therapies for breast cancer

 

more likely to occur in postmenopausal women and is the
most worrisome adverse effect of tamoxifen in patients with
metastatic breast cancer. long-term use (5 years) of the agent
is associated with a statistically higher risk (p < .00001) of
endometrial lesions, such as low-grade glandular hyperplasia
and polyps, compared with untreated patients.?!

 xxxd2557xxx 

 xxxd2557xxx  acetate, a progestin, has equal response rates of 37%
when compared with tamoxifen in randomized trials.?7.?3
other research has shown  xxxd2557xxx  to be a viable option for
patients with advanced breast cancer that is unresponsive to
tamoxifen, even more so than a course of chemotherapy in
women believed to be hormone insensitive.24 weight gain is
one of the more important adverse reactions associated with
 xxxd2557xxx , occurring in up to 50% of patients.!? patients who
experience weight gain may also have some fluid retention.
however, weight gain may be a beneficial side effect in patients
who experience cancer-induced wasting or cachexia. other
adverse reactions to  xxxd2557xxx  include hot flashes (< 10%)
and vaginal bleeding (5% to 10%) either during therapy or at
discontinuation.

although both  xxxd2557xxx  and tamoxifen have been remark-
ably successful in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, the
adverse effects associated with their use have fueled the quest
for new treatment strategies in metastatic breast cancer, includ-
ing the als and the “pure” antiestrogens.

aromatase inhibitors

als are used in postmenopausal women with advanced breast
cancer. in this patient population, the principal source of cir-
culating estrogens is from the conversion of adrenal and ovar-
ian androgens (ie, androstenedione and testosterone) to estro-
gens (ie, estrone and estradiol) by aromatase in the peripheral
tissues. by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme and preventing the
conversion to estrogen, the estrogen level is decreased. the
early ai  xxxd147xxx , due to its nonselective inhibition
of steroid hormones and associated toxicities (eg, adrenal
insufficiency, lethargy),?° has very limited use.

newer generation als with an improved safety profile
include the nonsteroidal anastrozole, letrozole, and steroidal
exemestane. anastrozole and letrozole have a similar steroidal
chemical structure and bind reversibly to the aromatase
enzyme. exemestane binds irreversibly to the binding site of
the enzyme. these agents selectively inhibit the aromatase
enzyme and do not have the toxicities of earlier nonselective
als and are very well tolerated.

when first introduced, als were indicated as second-line
hormonal therapy.>79!%2¢28 in patients who have failed
prior tamoxifen therapy, the selective aromatase inhibitors
(sais) anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole have demon-
strated significant antitumor activity. patients have been able
to achieve a clinical benefit ranging from approximately 25%
to more than 40% and a response rate of approximately 15%

although the sais were initially used as second-line ther-
apy, recent evidence has demonstrated that these agents, when
used as first-line therapy, are at least as effective as tamoxifen
if not superior (table 3).3°-33 in a randomized double-blinded
multicenter study comparing anastrozole (1 mg/d) to tamox-
 xxxd2315xxx  (20 mg/d), anastrozole was found to be as effective as
tamoxifen in terms of overall response (21% vs 17% of
patients, respectively).3! however, a clinical benefit (cr + pr
+ sd = 24 weeks) of 59% was achieved among the anastro-
zole-treated patients, which was significantly higher than the
46% rate noted in tamoxifen-treated patients (2-sided p <
.01). time to disease progression (ttp) was also significantly
longer in patients who received anastrozole than in those who
were given tamoxifen (11.1 vs 5.6 months; 2-sided p = .005).
both drugs were well tolerated, although patients who
received tamoxifen experienced more thromboembolic events
(8.2% vs 4.1%) and vaginal bleeding (3.8% vs 1.2%) than
those who received anastrozole.3!

similar results have been demonstrated with other sais. a
study of 907 postmenopausal women with metastatic breast
cancer comparing letrozole to tamoxifen as first-line therapy
showed that letrozole was significantly superior to tamoxifen
in terms of ttp (44 weeks vs 26 weeks) and reduced the risk

m pure antiestrogen—estrogen
receptor downregulator

pure antiestrogens are true and absolute antagonists of estro-
gen because they are chemically similar to estrogen and bind
directly to er, rendering these receptors completely nonfunc-
tional (figure 1), yet they have no estrogenic effects of their
own.>4 of the compounds initially developed in this class, ful-
vestrant is the purest er antagonist, with high-affinity binding
to the er approaching that of 17a-estradiol.34+-3¢

when a pure antiestrogen binds to the er, besides acting as
a blocker to prevent the estrogen from binding,  xxxd2165xxx  also
degrades the er protein.?7 in a clinical study, administration
of  xxxd2165xxx  resulted in significant reductions in the tumor
expression of er.3® reduction in cellular levels of er protein
is known as er downregulation. downregulation of the er by
pure antiestrogens is now recognized as a unique and an

important component to the mechanism of action of this class
of compounds. as such, they are becoming known as estrogen
receptor downregulators (er downregulators).

the er downregulators, notably  xxxd2165xxx , represent a
new class of endocrine agents with distinctly different modes
of action compared with the serms. in animal studies, ful-
vestrant demonstrated a longer duration of tumor suppression
compared with tamoxifen and had significant tumor suppres-
sion activity in tamoxifen-resistant tumors.3?4° in addition, as

 

 

a pure antiestrogen,  xxxd2165xxx , in contrast to tamoxifen, does
not have any agonistic activity on the endometrium (unpub-
lished data, astrazeneca pharmaceuticals, lp, 2001). further-
more,  xxxd2165xxx  does not cross the blood-brain barrier! and,
therefore, may not induce hot flashes to the same degree as
tamoxifen.

research indicates that  xxxd2165xxx  can be used in the treat-
ment of metastatic breast cancer. in an early phase i/ii trial,
 xxxd2165xxx  was administered to 19 postmenopausal tamoxifen-
resistant women with advanced breast cancer.42 overall, clini-
cal benefit was achieved in 69% of the patients. partial
responses of 3 to 20 months’ duration were seen in 7 patients
(37%) on  xxxd2165xxx , and 6 patients (32%) had stable disease
with a duration of 9 to = 23 months. no hot flashes were
noted.

two recently completed phase iii randomized multicenter
trials, 1 in europe and 1 in north america, compared the effi-
cacy and safety of  xxxd2165xxx  administered once monthly by
intramuscular injection with that of anastrozole given daily by
oral administration in postmenopausal women with advanced
breast cancer who developed progressive disease with prior
endocrine therapy.4? the primary endpoint was ttp; sec-
ondary endpoints were or (cr + pr) rate, duration of
response (dor), and tolerability. median follow-up time was
14.6 months (european study) and 17.0 months (north
american study), with disease progression occurring in 83% of
randomized patients. efficacy endpoints are listed in table 4.
overall,  xxxd2165xxx  was at least as effective as anastrozole in
terms of ttr or, and clinical benefit in both studies. in
responders from the north american study, the median dor
was longer for  xxxd2165xxx -treated patients (19.3 months vs
10.5 months for anastrozole-treated patients). the longer
dor with  xxxd2165xxx , however, was not seen in the european
study and will require further validation.

both drugs had similar tolerability profiles and were essen-
tially well tolerated, with the most common adverse reactions
being mild hot flashes and gastrointestinal disturbances. less
common side effects included vaginitis, thromboembolic
events, arthralgia, arthrosis, urinary tract infections, and joint
disorders. the incidence of therapy discontinuation due to a
drug-related adverse event was 0.9% for  xxxd2165xxx  and 1.2%
for anastrozole.  xxxd2165xxx  is the first er downregulator
proven to be at least as effective as anastrozole in post-
menopausal women with advanced breast cancer, noteworthy

on the basis of currently available clinical data,  xxxd2165xxx  can
be integrated into the sequence of endocrine therapies after
failure of tamoxifen or an al (figure 2), although many ques-

tions remain unanswered regarding the appropriate sequence

of endocrine therapies. future trials will assess the long-term

safety of  xxxd2165xxx  in postmenopausal women with metasta-
tic carcinoma of the breast. an ongoing trial is studying ful-
vestrant versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy. other studies

are examining the efficacy and optimal dose of  xxxd2165xxx  for

treating premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.

finally, a large-scale trial of  xxxd2165xxx  for adjuvant therapy of

early breast cancer has entered into the planning stages.
