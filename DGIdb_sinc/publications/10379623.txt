naltrexone and beta-funaltrexamine antagonism of the antinociceptive
and response rate-decreasing effects of morphine,  xxxd1864xxx ,
and  xxxd3031xxx 
received: 14 august 1998 / final version: 4 december 1998

abstract rationale: patterns of competitive and insurmountable antagonism provide important data to guide
the classification and characterization of different types
of opioid agonists as well as infer the mechanism of action for agonists. objective: experiments with the competitive antagonist, naltrexone, and the insurmountable
antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-fna), were conducted
to determine whether the antinociceptive and rate-decreasing effects of the opioid agonists  xxxd1864xxx  and dpropoxyphene are 1) mediated through µ opioid receptors in rats, and 2) differ from morphine with respect to
relative efficacy. methods: the rat tail-withdrawal assay
was used to measure antinociception and a fixed ratio 20
(fr20) schedule of food delivery was used to measure
rate suppression. results: naltrexone (0.01–1.0 mg/kg)
was approximately equipotent as an antagonist of the antinociceptive and rate-decreasing effects of both morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  and as an antagonist of the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd3031xxx . naltrexone failed to
block the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx . betafna (5 and 10 mg/kg) also antagonized the antinociceptive and rate-decreasing effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  as well as the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd3031xxx . beta-fna failed to produce a dose-dependent antagonism of the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx .
conclusions: these data suggest that the antinociceptive
effects of morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  and
the rate-decreasing effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  are
mediated through µ opioid receptors. overall, high doses
of beta-fna produced a greater degree of antagonism of
the behavioral effects of  xxxd1864xxx  than morphine or

 xxxd3031xxx , confirming other reports that  xxxd1864xxx 
is a lower efficacy agonist than morphine. additionally,
the degree of antagonism produced by beta-fna was greater for the antinociceptive effects of all three compounds
than for the rate-decreasing effects.

introduction
experiments with competitive and insurmountable antagonists provide important data to guide the classification and characterization of different types of opioid agonists and to infer mechanisms of action for these agonists. for example, experiments with competitive antagonists show that the behavioral effects of different opioid
agonists such as morphine, u50,488, and bw373u86
are mediated through different opioid receptor types
(dykstra et al. 1988; negus et al. 1993). additionally,
experiments with competitive antagonists provide evidence that some classes of opioid agonists produce discriminative-stimulus, rate-decreasing, and antinociceptive effects through a common, presumably µ, opioid receptor (walker et al. 1994). experiments with insurmountable antagonists such as beta-funaltrexamine (betafna) can provide data on the relative efficacy of opioid
agonists (zimmerman et al. 1987; adams et al. 1990;
pitts et al. 1996; morgan and picker 1998). if a larger
dose of beta-fna is required to decrease the maximum effects produced by morphine than  xxxd1864xxx , it can be inferred that  xxxd1864xxx  requires a larger fraction of the receptor population available to produce effects than morphine.
the purpose of the present series of experiments was
to use competitive and insurmountable antagonists to
compare the receptor selectivity and relative efficacy of
two opioid agonists,  xxxd3031xxx  and  xxxd1864xxx . although  xxxd3031xxx  and  xxxd1864xxx  are used clinically,
relatively little is known about their behavioral pharma-

46

cology. the radioligand binding profiles for  xxxd3031xxx  and  xxxd1864xxx  are similar in that both reveal an approximately 10-fold selectivity of µ over  xxxg1632xxx  subtypes and a 30-fold selectivity of µ over kappa opioid
receptor subtypes (neil 1984; o’brien and benfield
1989; chen et al. 1993; yoburn et al. 1995). both  xxxd3031xxx  and  xxxd1864xxx  produce morphine-like antinociception in a number of assays (malis et al. 1975;
hayes et al. 1987a; tiano et al. 1998) as well as morphine-like discriminative stimulus effects (shannon and
holtzman 1977; overton and batta 1979; young et al.
1992). early characterization indicates that  xxxd3031xxx ’s relative efficacy as an agonist is similar to that
of morphine and higher than that of buprenorphine (martin et al. 1976; hayes et al. 1987b). in contrast, observations in animal (malis et al. 1975; rowlingson et al.
1983; young et al. 1984) and human subjects (romagnoli and keats 1984; o’brien and benfield 1989;
zacny et al. 1992; strain et al. 1996) indicate that  xxxd1864xxx  has lower efficacy that morphine.
although reports indicate that  xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  produce their behavioral effects through the
same opioid receptor subtype as morphine, there is also
evidence to suggest differences among these agonists.
for example, several studies indicate that the doses of an
opioid antagonist required to block the antinociceptive,
rate-decreasing, or discriminative-stimulus effects of  xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  are similar to the doses required to block the effects of morphine (nickander et al.
1977; lehman and peterson 1978). nevertheless, other
studies (gal and difazio 1984) indicate that opioid antagonists are less potent in blocking these effects of  xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  than morphine (neil and
terenius 1981; schaefer and holtzman 1981; picker et
al. 1993). other reports indicate that opioid antagonists
are ineffective in blocking the rate-decreasing effects of
 xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  (leander 1979; picker
1997). moreover,  xxxd3031xxx  reveals very little
cross-tolerance to morphine (neil 1982) or supersensitivity to naltrexone (paronis and holtzman 1992; yoburn et
al. 1995) in antinociceptive assays, suggesting that other
opioid receptors or non-opioid receptors may be involved in some of  xxxd3031xxx ’s effects.
in order to examine these differences further, the ratedecreasing and antinociceptive effects of  xxxd1864xxx  and dpropoxyphene were examined alone and in combination
with the competitive antagonist naltrexone and the insurmountable antagonist, beta-fna. beta-fna is a highly-selective, long-lasting µ-receptor  xxxd3249xxx  that has
been used in both antinociceptive and scheduled-controlled responding assays to make inferences about the
relative efficacy of opioid agonists (zimmerman et al.
1987; adams et al. 1990; pitts et al. 1996b). operant and
reflexive behavioral endpoints were chosen to increase
the generality of the conclusions. antinociception, as the
reflexive measure, is a clinically relevant, behavioral
endpoint that is extremely sensitive to opioid as well as
non-opioid activity. schedule-controlled responding, as
the operant measure, is also sensitive to both opioid and

non-opioid activity and can be used to assess a drug’s selectivity over a behaviorally active range of doses (cf.
negus et al. 1993).

materials and methods
subjects
forty-six male, long-evans rats weighing 300–360 g were used.
rats were housed individually in a humidity- and temperaturecontrolled room under a 12-h light/dark cycle. rats were fed a daily ration of 20–25 g to maintain body weights and were given continuous access to water. testing of individual rats occurred approximately once a week in the tail-withdrawal assay and once or
twice a week in the schedule-controlled responding assay. the rats
in the tail-withdrawal experiments were habituated to the restraint
tubes and the testing room on two occasions before drug testing
began.
apparatus
in the tail-withdrawal assay, six rodent restraint tubes were used.
a precision model 182 water bath maintained water temperature
at approximately 80°c. water temperatures of 40 and 55°c were
obtained by mixing water from the water bath with tap water in a
wide-mouth thermos (diameter=11 cm). water temperature was
measured with a vwr digital thermometer model 100 a and
tail-withdrawal latency was measured with a hand-operated digital
stopwatch with a time resolution of 1/100 s.
in the schedule-controlled responding assay, experiments took
place in eight standard rat operant-conditioning chambers (gerbrands model g7322) enclosed in ventilated sound-attenuating cubicles. each chamber was equipped with two response levers
mounted 13 cm apart and 9 cm above the floor. two stimulus
lamps were located 7 cm above each lever. only the left lever and
stimulus lights were used in the present experiments. a food receptacle was centered 6 cm below the two levers. a sonalert tone
generator was mounted behind the front panel and two houselights
were located on the ceiling above the rear wall. white noise was
present within each chamber and throughout the room. experimental events were programmed and data were collected using a
microcomputer controlled by software and interfacing supplied by
med associates, inc. (georgia, vt., usa).
tail-withdrawal procedure
thirty-six rats were used in the tail-withdrawal procedure. antinociceptive testing occurred within a 4-h time period, between 10
a.m. and 2 p.m. rats were placed into the restraining tubes with
their tails hanging freely. the last 5–10 cm of the tail was immersed into either 40° or 55°c water, and the latency for tail withdrawal was measured. a 15-s cut-off time was imposed to prevent
tissue damage. the first three test trials were conducted with 40°c
water. if a rat removed its tail from the 40°c water on more than
one test trial, that rat did not continue in the experimental session
(one rat was removed from one control morphine experiment). after the first test periods with 40°c water, single tail-withdrawal latencies from 55°c water were obtained for each rat. a 2-min interval occurred between each test trial.
after control values were obtained, the first drug injection was
administered. fifteen minutes later, latencies from both 40°c and
55°c water were redetermined during a 10-min testing period.
each temperature was presented once, in random order, with a 2min interval between stimulus presentations. at the conclusion of
the 10-min testing period, a second drug injection occurred which
increased total dose by 0.25–0.50 log unit. fifteen minutes later,
tail-withdrawal latencies were redetermined from 40°c and 55°c
water. this cumulative-dosing procedure was terminated when

47
tail-withdrawal latencies reached maximum effect (15 s) in 55°c
water, the solubility limits of a compound were reached, or other
effects interfered with the measurements (i.e. convulsions, death).
in the antagonism experiments, three morphine or  xxxd1864xxx 
control dose-response curves were obtained in two groups of seven rats. thereafter, on a weekly basis, a morphine or  xxxd1864xxx  cumulative dose-response curve was redetermined, in the presence
of a dose of naltrexone, as described above. the effects of naltrexone alone were tested in the first component of the experiment.
two weeks after the last naltrexone experiment, a control dose-response curve was determined for morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  in the respective groups and was similar to previous control dose-response
curves. next, 5.0 mg/kg beta-fna was administered 24 h prior to the
redetermination of the morphine or  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response curve.
morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  were tested once a week in the respective
groups until the dose-response curves were not significantly different than the initial control dose-response curves (approximately
4 weeks). next, 10 mg/kg beta-fna was administered 24 h prior to
the redetermination of the morphine or  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response
curve.
the naltrexone and beta-fna experiments with  xxxd3031xxx 
were conducted in a modified-groups design because preliminary
tests in the scheduled-controlled responding assay (see below) revealed that lesions at the site of injection, convulsions, and/or
death were observed in some rats approximately 12 h after testing
with  xxxd3031xxx . thus, although two  xxxd3031xxx  control
dose-response curves were tested in all rats, some rats participated
in only one naltrexone or beta-fna experiment. in the antagonism
experiments in which high doses of  xxxd3031xxx  were administered, the rats were typically euthanized immediately after the
tests. when relatively low doses of  xxxd3031xxx  were used, as
in the 0.01 mg/kg naltrexone experiment, lethality was not observed. therefore, these rats also received a dose of beta-fna 2
weeks later. other details of the antagonism experiments were as
described above.
schedule-controlled responding procedure
ten experimentally naive rats were trained to press the left lever
under an fr1 schedule of food presentation. when the stimulus
lamps above the lever were lit, each lever press resulted in the delivery of a 45 mg noyes pellet. whenever a pellet was delivered,
the houselight dimmed briefly and a tone was sounded. once the
rats were pressing the lever reliably, the response requirement was
increased gradually over several sessions to an fr20. when response rates stabilized under the fr20 schedule, the rats were
trained in a multiple fr20 timeout (to) 10-min schedule. in this
schedule, the chamber was dark and lever presses had no programmed consequences during the to component. each fr20
component ended after 5 min or the delivery of the tenth food pellet, whichever occurred first. if ten food pellets were earned before 5 min, the chamber was darkened until the initiation of the
next to component; lever presses during this period had no programmed consequences. each session began with the fr20 component and the to and fr20 components alternated thereafter.
sessions ended after the completion of five to seven fr20 components and were conducted 5 days per week.
when response rates stabilized under the multiple schedule,
dose-response curves for morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  were determined using a cumulative-dosing procedure. under this procedure, the lowest dose of a drug was administered.
ten minutes later, the first fr20 component began. at the conclusion of the 5-min fr20 component, the rat was removed from the
chamber and injected with a second drug dose which increased the
total dose by 0.25–0.50 log units. ten minutes later, the second
fr20 component began. this cumulative-dosing procedure continued until a cumulative dose was reached that decreased response rates to fewer than 0.2 responses/s, the solubility limits of
a drug were reached, or other effects of a drug interfered with the
measurements (i.e. convulsions, death). cumulative dose tests
generally occurred on tuesdays and fridays and vehicle injections
were given before each component on thursdays.

in the naltrexone and beta-fna antagonism studies, a total of ten
rats were used throughout the experiments. two or three morphine
or  xxxd1864xxx  control dose-response curves were determined in subsets of six to eight rats (naltrexone) or five rats (beta-fna). two dpropoxyphene control dose-response curves were determined in
subsets of three to five rats. naltrexone was administered and the
rate-decreasing effects of naltrexone alone were tested in the first
component of the experiment. thereafter, the agonist cumulative
dose-response curve was redetermined, in the presence of naltrexone, as described above. the effects of three doses of naltrexone
were examined over the course of 2 or 3 weeks. in the beta-fna experiments, a dose of 5.0 or 10 mg/kg beta-fna was administered and
the rate-decreasing effects of beta-fna alone were tested for five
components. the next day, 24 h after the beta-fna injection, the agonist dose-response curves were redetermined. rats in these experiments received multiple injections of naltrexone and/or betafna over the course of 1 year. a rat was not tested after a naltrexone or beta-fna experiment with the next dose of naltrexone or betafna unless the agonist dose-response curves were not significantly different than the initial control dose-response curves.
data analysis
tail-withdrawal latencies following drug administration were converted into percent maximum effect by the formula:
maximum effect =

test latency − control latency
×100
(15 sec − control latency)

each rat served as its own control. a value of 0% maximum effect
was assigned if tail-withdrawal latencies were less than the control
latency. in the scheduled-controlled responding assay, the rate of
responding (responses/s) was determined for an individual rat by
dividing the total number of responses in a component by the time
spent in the component. the effects of agonists alone or in combination with the antagonists on rates of responding are expressed as
a percentage of saline control rates collected 1–3 days prior to the
test. control data were pooled for individual rats and then averaged into a group mean for both the tail-withdrawal and schedulecontrolled responding assays.
the dose of each drug that produced 50% maximal effect or a
50% reduction in response rate (ed50 values) was determined for
each individual rat by linear regression using at least three points
of the ascending (tail-withdrawal assay) or descending (scheduledcontrolled responding assay) portions of the dose-response curves.
individual ed50 values were then averaged to obtain group ed50
values and 95% cl. in the antagonism experiments, naltrexone
apparent pa2 values were determined using schild regressions as
previously described (arunlakshana and schild 1959) and with
drug doses substituted for drug concentrations (takemori 1974)
using the program from tallarida and murray (1987). specifically,
in this case, the apparent pa2 value is defined as the negative logarithm of the molar dose of antagonist that produces a two-fold
shift to the right in the agonist dose-response curve. slopes from
the schild regression were considered to be significantly different
from unity if the 95% cl of the slope did not include –1. to determine significance in the beta-fna experiments, control individual
ed50 values were compared to beta-fna individual ed50 values using a paired student’s t-test (graphpad instat, v2.05a). analysis
of covariance of multiple regression lines was used to determine
whether the slopes of the linear portions of the dose-response
curves were different (graphpad prism v1.03). the level of significance was set at p<0.05 for all analyses.
drugs
the following drugs were examined:  xxxd2670xxx  and beta-funaltrexamine hydrochloride (supplied by the national institute on
drug abuse, rockville, md., usa),  xxxd1864xxx  hydrochloride (astra pharmaceutical products, inc., westborough, mass., usa), dpropoxyphene and naltrexone hydrochloride (research biochemi-

48
cals inc., natick, mass., usa). all injections were administered
sc in the dorsal flank in a volume of 0.5–2.0 ml/kg. doses are expressed in terms of the salt.
experimental subjects
the rats used in this study were maintained in accordance with the
guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of
the university of north carolina and the “guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals” (institute of laboratory animal resources, national academy press 1996; nih publication no. 8523, revised 1985).

results
naltrexone antagonism studies
prior to naltrexone pretreatment, cumulative doses of
morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  each produced
dose-dependent increases in tail-withdrawal latency (fig.
1, top panels). morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx 
also produced dose-dependent decreases in response rate
(fig. 1, bottom panels). naltrexone produced a dose-dependent, surmountable antagonism of the antinociceptive
and rate-decreasing effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx .
naltrexone also antagonized the antinociceptive effects
of  xxxd3031xxx  although  xxxd3031xxx  did not
produce a maximal antinociceptive effect when combined with a dose of 1.0 mg/kg naltrexone. although low
doses of naltrexone (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) shifted the dpropoxyphene dose-response curve rightward in the
scheduled-controlled responding procedure, 1.0 mg/kg
naltrexone produced a smaller shift in the  xxxd3031xxx  dose-response curve than 0.1 mg/kg naltrexone.
low doses of naltrexone blocked the convulsant and lethal effects of intermediate doses of  xxxd3031xxx  observed in 30% of the rats 12 h after testing in the sched-

uled-controlled responding assay. all agonist dose-response curves obtained for morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and dpropoxyphene in combination with naltrexone were parallel to the initial dose-response curves for morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  alone in both procedures.
linear schild regressions (fig. 2) and apparent pa2
analysis (table 1) revealed naltrexone’s potency as an
antagonist of the antinociceptive and rate-decreasing effects of morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx . naltrexone was approximately equipotent (i.e., the 95% cl
of the apparent pa2 values overlapped) as an antagonist
of the antinociceptive and rate-decreasing effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  and as an antagonist of the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd3031xxx . a schild regression
for naltrexone in combination with  xxxd3031xxx 
could not be determined because the effects of naltrexone were not dose-dependent (fig. 1). the slopes of the
schild regressions that were not different from unity
were constrained to –1 and the constrained apparent pa2
values for naltrexone were determined. the constrained
apparent pa2 values were not significantly different than
the unconstrained values.

beta-fna antagonism studies
prior to beta-fna pretreatment, cumulative doses of morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  each produced
dose-dependent increases in tail-withdrawal latency (fig.
3, top panels) similar to those increases observed in the
naltrexone experiments (fig. 1, top panels). pretreatment
with 5.0 mg/kg beta-fna produced approximately 5- and
6-fold shifts in the morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response
curves, respectively (fig. 3, top panels; table 2). increasing the pretreatment dose to 10 mg/kg beta-fna produced a larger degree of antagonism: 20- and 90-fold
shifts in the morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response
curves, respectively. pretreatment doses of 5.0 and 10
mg/kg beta-fna produced approximately 2- and 6-fold
shifts in the  xxxd3031xxx  dose-response curves, respectively, although the shift after 10 mg/kg beta-fna was
not significant. after 5.0 mg/kg beta-fna, a maximum ef-

in the schedule-controlled responding assay, morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  also produced
dose-dependent decreases in response rate (fig. 3, bottom panels), similar to those decreases observed in earlier experiments (fig. 1, bottom panels). beta-fna (5.0 and
10 mg/kg) alone failed to alter response rate when tested
after 15 min, 120 min, or 24 h (data not shown). pretreatment with 5.0 mg/kg beta-fna produced a 5-fold shift
in the  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response curve. this dose of betafna failed to alter significantly the  xxxd3031xxx 
dose-response curve and was not tested in combination
with morphine. increasing the pretreatment dose to 10
mg/kg beta-fna produced approximately 6- and 4-fold
shifts in the morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response
curves, respectively, although the shift in the  xxxd1864xxx 
dose-response curve was not significant. a dose of 10
mg/kg beta-fna did not significantly alter the  xxxd3031xxx  dose-response curve. all agonist dose-response
curves obtained for morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and  xxxd3031xxx  in combination with beta-fna were parallel to the
initial dose-response curves for morphine,  xxxd1864xxx , and
 xxxd3031xxx  alone in both procedures.

discussion
in the present series of experiments, the receptor selectivity of  xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  was characterized
by comparing in vivo pa2 values obtained for  xxxd1864xxx 
and  xxxd3031xxx  to those obtained for morphine in
two behavioral preparations. naltrexone was approximately equipotent as an antagonist of the antinociceptive
and rate-decreasing effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx 
and of the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd3031xxx ,
suggesting that these opioids produce these effects

7.3–8.5 for naltrexone are similar to values obtained for
naltrexone in other studies using behavioral preparations
such as tail-withdrawal (7.2–8.4), drug discrimination
(7.3–7.8), and scheduled-controlled responding (7.1–7.9)
(young et al. 1992; walker et al. 1994; pitts et al. 1996).
it is important to note, however, that the schild regression slope for naltrexone as an antagonist of the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd1864xxx  was significantly different than unity. when examining the schild plot for naltrexone in combination with  xxxd1864xxx , the shallow slope
of this regression is predominantly due to a smaller than
predicted shift in the  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response curve after
the high dose of naltrexone. this observation suggests
that additional receptors may be involved in  xxxd1864xxx ’s
antinociceptive effects or that a non-equilibrium steady
state exists between naltrexone,  xxxd1864xxx , and presumably the µ opioid receptors (cf. kenakin 1997). previous
studies using the same assay but conducted in spraguedawley rats revealed a similar apparent pa2 value for
naltrexone in combination with  xxxd1864xxx  to that value
obtained in the present study with long evans rats. in

of the schild regression included unity (e. a. walker,
unpublished observations). it is unlikely that the deviation from unity for the schild regression for naltrexone
and  xxxd1864xxx  is due to species differences. a more plausible explanation probably lies in the inherent variability
associated with quantifying the antagonism of the behavioral effects of low efficacy agonists (e.g., koek and
woods 1989).
the observation that naltrexone failed to antagonize
the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx  in a dosedependent manner suggests that either other receptors
are involved in this behavioral effect or that the toxicity
of  xxxd3031xxx  may have limited the degree of antagonism observed. clearly,  xxxd3031xxx  has affinity
for other opioid receptors (neil 1984; chen et al. 1993;
yoburn et al. 1995), suggesting the rate-decreasing effects may be mediated through a combination of opioid
and perhaps non-opioid mechanisms. the toxicity of dpropoxyphene also may have limited the degree of antagonism produced by naltrexone. this compound occasionally produced lesions at the site of injection, which
may be a result of the local anesthetic properties of dpropoxyphene (nickander et al. 1977). also, the ld50
for  xxxd3031xxx  in rats was within the range of a
control  xxxd3031xxx  dose-response curve (emmerson
et al. 1971), resulting in death for 30% of the scheduledcontrolled responding rats approximately 12 h after testing. therefore, a modified-groups design was adopted
and the number of exposures to  xxxd3031xxx  was reduced for an individual subject. interestingly, while naltrexone and beta-fna failed to dose-dependently block the
rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx , these antagonists blocked the lethal effects of intermediate and high
doses of  xxxd3031xxx . other studies have demonstrated that naloxone pretreatment or morphine chronic
treatment reversed the acute lethality produced by  xxxd3031xxx  (nickander et al. 1977). pentobarbital but not
naloxone prevented convulsions induced by  xxxd3031xxx  in rodents without altering the threshold dose for
lethality (fiut et al. 1966). these data, as well as the observations from the present experiments, suggest that the
acute lethal effects but not the convulsant effects of dpropoxyphene may be mediated by opioid receptors in
rodents. other opioid effects of  xxxd3031xxx  in humans or animals that are reversed by opioid antagonists
include sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hypotension, and respiratory depression. the other effects of
 xxxd3031xxx  in humans or animals that are not reversed by opioid antagonists, and therefore most likely
non-opioid effects, include tremors, central nervous
system stimulation, and cardiac depression (nickander et
al. 1984).
a number of studies have shown that the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx  or lower efficacy
opioid agonists are not blocked by opioid antagonists
(e.g., leander and mcmillan 1977; izenwasser et al.
1996; picker 1997). whether an opioid antagonist will
block the rate-decreasing effects of an agonist may depend on species or strain tested. for example, neither

naloxone nor naltrexone blocked the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd1864xxx  or  xxxd3031xxx  in pigeons (leander
1979; picker 1997); however, in the present study, naltrexone clearly antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of
 xxxd1864xxx  in long-evans rats. similarly, the rate-decreasing effects of nalbuphine usually are not antagonized by
opioid antagonists in sprague-dawley rats or in pigeons
(walker and young 1993; gerak and france 1996; picker et al. 1996); however, naltrexone has been shown to
antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of nalbuphine in
long-evans rats (pitts et al. 1996). perhaps the relevant
difference between these experiments is not the species
or strains per se but rather the potency of the agonist in a
given species or a given type of behavioral assay. for example, the doses of  xxxd1864xxx  that decreased response
rates in the present study (1 mg/kg) are slightly lower
than those that have been shown to decrease response
rates in a pigeon drug discrimination procedure (3.2 and
10 mg/kg) (picker 1997). other studies indicated that
nalbuphine is far more potent when responding was
maintained under an fr30 schedule of food delivery
(pitts et al. 1996) than when responding is maintained
under an fr20 schedule in the same strain of rats (m. a.
smith, personal communication). large differences in
potency such as these may determine the extent to which
an opioid antagonist can alter the rate-decreasing effects
of opioids, especially those that may have multiple opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action at very high
doses.
the results from the beta-fna antagonism experiments
paralleled the results obtained in the naltrexone antagonism experiments in a number of ways. first, beta-fna antagonized both the antinociceptive and rate-decreasing
effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  as well as the antinociceptive effects of  xxxd3031xxx , further supporting the
hypothesis that these effects are mediated through µ opioid receptors. second, the pattern of antagonism produced by beta-fna in blocking  xxxd3031xxx ’s rate-decreasing effects was similar to the pattern observed in
the naltrexone experiments. that is, whereas a low dose
of beta-fna (5.0 mg/kg) blocked the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx , a higher dose of beta-fna (10
mg/kg) was ineffective. an examination of data from individual rats reveals that the dose of 5.0 mg/kg beta-fna
produced a modest antagonism of  xxxd3031xxx  in all
rats. in contrast, the 10 mg/kg dose of beta-fna produced
complete antagonism in two rats and no antagonism in
another two rats. this variability in the susceptibility of
individual rats to beta-fna antagonism was not observed
with  xxxd1864xxx  or morphine.
since higher doses of beta-fna (40 mg/kg) have been
shown to block other effects of  xxxd3031xxx  (hayes
et al. 1987b), it is possible that larger doses of beta-fna
would have completely antagonized the rate-decreasing
effects of  xxxd3031xxx  in all of the rats. if higher
doses of beta-fna were tested in the present experiments
and these doses blocked the effects of  xxxd3031xxx ,
 xxxd3031xxx  would be considered a higher efficacy
agonist than morphine or  xxxd1864xxx . however, definitive

52

conclusions about  xxxd3031xxx ’s relative efficacy
must be postponed because the results regarding the receptor selectivity of  xxxd3031xxx  were not straightforward. nevertheless,  xxxd3031xxx  is probably not
higher efficacy than morphine because  xxxd3031xxx 
is a poor substitute for morphine in addicts and pronounced abstinence is not observed after chronic administration of  xxxd3031xxx  (fraser and isbell 1960).
investigators have postulated that an insurmountable
antagonist will produce a downward shift in the dose-response curve for a low efficacy agonist at doses lower
than those that produce downward shifts in the dose-response curves of high efficacy agonists (adams et al.
1990; burke et al. 1994). this hypothesis is based on the
notion that low efficacy agonists require a larger available fraction of the receptor population to produce a
maximum effect (sosnowski and yaksh 1990). therefore, lower efficacy agonists should be more susceptible
to decreases in the receptor population produced by betafna than higher efficacy agonists. for example, in a
similar scheduled-controlled responding experiment, 5.0
mg/kg beta-fna altered the slope of the dose-response
curve for nalorphine but not butorphanol or fentanyl,suggesting nalorphine is a lower efficacy agonist than butorphanol or fentanyl (pitts et al. 1996). in the present experiment, however, beta-fna failed to produce any significant downward shifts or any significant changes in slope
in the agonist dose-response curves, suggesting that the
efficacy differences among these agonists cannot be detected under these experimental conditions. in the same
tail-withdrawal procedure as that used in the present experiment, pretreatment with 5.0 mg/kg beta-fna in
sprague-dawley rats produced both a rightward and
downward shift in the  xxxd1864xxx  dose-response curve.
this same dose of beta-fna was ineffective in antagonizing the effects of a number of other opioid agonists ( xxxd2070xxx , l-methadone, morphine, and buprenorphine),
further supporting the notion that  xxxd1864xxx  is a lower efficacy agonist than these agonists (tiano et al. 1998).
other experiments have demonstrated efficacy differences between  xxxd1864xxx  and morphine in both humans
and animals (young et al. 1984; o’brien and benfield
1989; strain et al. 1996). these data illustrate the importance of examining a series of agonists in combination
with an insurmountable antagonist in a variety of behavioral preparations in order to describe the rank order of
agonist relative efficacy.
the degree of antagonism produced by equal doses of
beta-fna in the tail-withdrawal assay was greater than in the
schedule-controlled responding assay. for example, a dose
of 10 mg/kg beta-fna produced a 3- and 20-fold greater antagonism of the antinociceptive effects of morphine and
 xxxd1864xxx , respectively, than of the rate-decreasing effects.
similarly, other studies have shown that the antinociceptive effects of opioid agonists are blocked by lower doses
of an insurmountable agonist such as beta-fna or clocinnamox than are the rate-decreasing effects (butelman
et al. 1996; zernig et al. 1994; walker et al. 1996, 1998).
these observations suggest that the tail-withdrawal assay
may require more activated functional µ receptors for a

given effect than this scheduled-controlled responding assay. therefore, agonists, especially lower efficacy agonists, might be more susceptible to beta-fna antagonism in
the tail-withdrawal assay than the scheduled-controlled responding assay under the present schedule conditions.
in conclusion, the opioid antagonists naltrexone and betafna dose-dependently antagonized the antinociceptive
effects of morphine,  xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  and
the rate-decreasing effects of morphine and  xxxd1864xxx .
these data suggest that these effects of morphine,  xxxd1864xxx  and  xxxd3031xxx  are mediated through µ opioid
receptors whereas the rate-decreasing effects of  xxxd3031xxx  are probably not mediated through µ opioid
receptors. furthermore, the observation that beta-fna produced a greater antagonism of the behavioral effects of
 xxxd1864xxx  than morphine or  xxxd3031xxx  suggests that
 xxxd1864xxx  is a lower efficacy agonist than morphine. firm
conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of  xxxd3031xxx  compared to morphine and  xxxd1864xxx  in these two
behavioral procedures cannot be made at the present time
due to the variability across the procedures in the effectiveness of naltrexone and beta-fna as antagonists.
