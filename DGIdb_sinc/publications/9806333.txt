1 the eects of the 5-ht2a/2c agonist dob, the selective 5-ht1a agonist ndo 008 (3-dipropylamino5-hydroxychroman), and the two enantiomers of the selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat (r(+)-8-ohdpat and s(7)-8-oh-dpat) were studied in a step-through passive avoidance (pa) test in the male
rat.
2 the 5-ht1a agonists injected prior to training (conditioning) produced a dose-dependent impairment
of pa retention when examined 24 h later. r(+)-8-oh-dpat was four times more eective than s(7)8-oh-dpat to cause an impairment of pa retention. both ndo 008 and the two enantiomers of 8oh-dpat induced the serotonin syndrome at the dose range that produced inhibition of the pa
response, thus, indicating activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors.
3 neither ndo 008 nor r(+)-8-oh-dpat induced head-twitches, a behavioural response attributed
to stimulation of postsynaptic 5-ht2a receptors. in contrast, dob induced head-twitches at the
0.01 mg kg71 dose while a 200 times higher dose was required to produce a signi®cant impairment of pa
retention.
4 the impairment of pa retention induced by both ndo 008 and r(+)-8-oh-dpat was fully
blocked by the active s(+)- enantiomer of the selective 5-ht1a antagonist way 100135 and the mixed
5-ht1a/b-adrenoceptor antagonist l(7)- xxxd123xxx . in contrast, the mixed 5-ht2a/2c antagonists
 xxxd2419xxx  and pirenperone were found to be ineective. moreover, the b2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici
118551, the b1-antagonist metoprolol as well as the mixed b-adrenoceptor blocker d(+)- xxxd123xxx  all
failed to modify the de®cit of pa retention by ndo 008 and r(+)-8-oh-dpat. none of the 5-ht1a or
5-ht2a/2c receptor antagonists tested or the b-blockers altered pa retention by themselves.
5 a 3 day pretreatment procedure (200+100+100 mg kg71) with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor
p-chlorophenylalanine (pcpa) did not alter pa retention and did not prevent the inhibitory action of
the 5-ht1a agonists, indicating that their eects on pa do not depend on endogenous 5-ht.
6 the eects of ndo 008 on pa were also studied using a state-dependent learning paradigm. ndo
008 was found to produce a disruption of pa when given either prior to training or retention or both
prior to training and retention but it failed to aect pa retention when given immediately after training.
7 these ®ndings indicate that the de®cit of passive avoidance retention induced by the 5-ht1a agonists
is mainly a result of stimulation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors but not 5-ht2a receptors. the 5-ht1a
receptor stimulation appears to interfere with learning processes operating at both acquisition and
retrieval.

introduction
at least 14 types of mammalian serotonin (5-ht) receptors
have been isolated and classi®ed into seven major families
(5-ht1 to 5-ht7) according to pharmacological, transductional and structural criteria (hoyer et al., 1994; hoyer &
martin, 1997). in view of this receptor multiplicity, the
potential role of the 5-ht receptor subtypes in behavioural
and physiological functions has been studied extensively
(saxena, 1995; villalon & terron, 1995).
earlier studies showed that changes in serotonergic
transmission in the brain could markedly modify aversive
conditioning in the rat. for instance, treatments which
increase serotonergic (5-ht) activity in the brain were reported
to induce a marked impairment of active and passive

avoidance (pa) learning (oègren, 1982, 1985b, 1986a, b). the
impairment of pa by p-chloroamphetamine (pca) appeared
to be related to 5-ht release and subsequent activation of 5ht1-like receptors but not 5-ht2-like receptors (oègren, 1985b,
1986b).
the development of selective 5-ht ligands has made it
possible to investigate the involvement of the  xxxg1108xxx 
subtype in pa. the selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-oh-dpat
given subcutaneously (s.c.) prior to pa training was found to
produce a dose-dependent impairment of retention in the rat
when examined 24 h later (carli et al., 1992; riekkinen, 1994).
importantly, this impairment did not seem to be related to
unspeci®c eects of 8-oh-dpat on behavioural performance
(carli et al., 1992). however, it is noteworthy that the racemic
form of 8-oh-dpat has been used as the `prototypical' agent
in the investigation of 5-ht1a receptors in most pharmacological studies. relatively few studies have exploited the
dierences in the biological activities of the two enantiomers
of 8-oh-dpat, i.e. r(+)-8-oh-dpat and s(7)-8-ohdpat (arvidsson et al., 1981, 1984; hjorth et al., 1982). the

500

i. misane et al

enantiomers of 8-oh-dpat have been reported to dier in
their activities in a number of in vitro and in vivo assays, e.g.
5-ht1a and dopamine receptor binding studies (bjoèrk et al.,
1989; lejeune et al., 1997),  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl
cyclase model (corn®eld et al., 1991; foreman et al., 1995),
inhibition of ®ring rate both in the dorsal raphe (lejeune et al.,
1997) and the ca3 area of the dorsal hippocampus (hadrava
et al., 1996), hypothermia (bjoèrk et al., 1989; hadrava et al.,
1996; yu et al., 1996) and pa (jackson et al., 1994).
8-oh-dpat which belongs to the chemical class of
tetralins (thorberg et al., 1987; liu et al., 1993; yu et al.,
1993; foreman et al., 1995; lejeune et al., 1997) has been
studied extensively because of its 5-ht1a agonistic properties.
chroman derivatives have received much less attention,
although in vitro studies have indicated that compounds like
5-meo-dpac and 5-oh-dpac (also known as ndo 008)
have high anities and selectivity for 5-ht1a receptors
(cossery et al., 1987; thorberg et al., 1987). little information
exists on the in vivo activity of chromans including their
behavioural eects. in this context, ndo 008 seems to be of
particular interest as a pharmacological tool since it is
chemically related to 8-oh-dpat (ndo 008 is a monohydroxy derivative of 8-oh-dpat) (thorberg et al., 1987).
the objective of the present study was to examine further
the involvement of  xxxg1108xxx  mechanisms in the
regulation of the pa response in the rat. the eects of the
two 5-ht1a agonists 8-oh-dpat (8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin; r(+)- and s(7)-enantiomers, respectively)
(arvidsson et al., 1981; hjorth et al., 1982; middlemiss &
fozard, 1983; hoyer et al., 1985) and ndo 008 (3dipropylamino-5-hydroxychroman) (thorberg et al., 1987)
were compared with those of the 5-ht2a/2c agonist dob (1(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane) (glennon
et al., 1984; titeler et al., 1985; titeler & lyon, 1987). in
addition, the possible cointeraction of 5-ht1a receptors and badrenoceptors in the modulation of pa behaviour was
examined. to analyse whether the eects of the 5-ht1a
agonists on pa were mediated via stimulation of pre- or
postsynaptic receptors, the serotonin syndrome (tricklebank
et al., 1984; berendsen et al., 1989; blanchard et al., 1993) was
scored in the pa procedure. in addition, we investigated if the
eects of ndo 008 and r(+)-8-oh-dpat were modulated
by pretreatment with the 5-ht synthesis inhibitor pchlorophenylalanine (pcpa). to examine the involvement of
5-ht2a versus 5-ht1a receptors in the modulation of pa
behaviour, the eectiveness of 5-ht agonists to induce headtwitches was tested, since this behavioural response is mediated
via stimulation of the postsynaptic 5-ht2a receptors (oègren et
al., 1982; peroutka & snyder, 1982). the possible involvement
of state-dependent learning (overton, 1966) in the pa
retention was assessed using ndo 008.
parts of this work have been presented in preliminary form
at the 19th annual meeting of the european brain and
behavioural society, 1987 (novi sad, yugoslavia) (johansson
et al., 1988).

methods
animals
adult male sprague-dawley rats (b & k universal ab,
sollentuna, sweden) weighing 260 ± 320 g were used in the
passive avoidance studies and rats weighing 150 ± 165 g in the
head-twitch tests, respectively. the animals were allowed at
least 1 week of adaptation in the standard maintenance

the  xxxg1108xxx  involvement in passive avoidance

facilities before the beginning of the experiments. the rats were
housed in macrolon1 cages, each cage containing 2 ± 6 animals
and maintained at an ambient room temperature (21+18c). a
12 h light/dark schedule was used throughout the experiment
and animals had free access to standard lab chow (ewos r36,
ewos ab, soèdertaèlje, sweden) and tap water up to the time of
the experiments. an habituation period of approximately
60 min to the environmental conditions of the experimental
room always preceded any experimental procedure.

passive avoidance (pa) and behavioural observations
pa was conducted as described in detail earlier (oègren,
1985b; 1986a). brie¯y, a modi®ed shuttle-box with two
communicating (sliding door built into the separating wall)
compartments of equal size and a stainless steel bar ¯oor was
used. the right-hand compartment (shock compartment) was
painted black to obtain a dark chamber. the left-hand
compartment was illuminated by a bulb installed on the top
plexiglass cover. the entire experiment was carried out by the
same experimenter.
training was conducted in a single session (day 1) during
the light phase (09 : 00 ± 16 : 00 h) of a 12 h day/night cycle.
the animals (n=6 ± 10, for details, see figure legends) were
treated with the test compounds as described below. after the
selected time interval following injection (day 1), rats were
placed into the light compartment (with no access to the dark
compartment) and allowed to explore for 3 min.
during the exploration phase in the pa apparatus, the
behaviour of the animals was assessed and the presence or
absence of the components of the serotonin (5-ht) syndrome
(¯at body posture, lower lip retraction, reciprocal forepaw
treading, head weaving, hind-limb abduction and tremor)
(tricklebank et al., 1984; berendsen et al., 1989) and the
rearing frequency were noted. a more detailed behavioural
analysis was performed in the ndo 008 and dob doseresponse studies. the serotonin (5-ht syndrome) was
quanti®ed using a ranked intensity scale where: 0=absent,
1=equivocal, 2=present, 3=intense. in these studies rearing
was scored by counting the number of full rearings (move of
the body through the vertical plane).
when 3 min expired, the sliding door was automatically
opened by pressing a pedal and the rats were allowed to cross
over into the dark compartment. once the rats had entered the
dark compartment with all four feet, the sliding door was
automatically shut and an unescapable, constant current,
scrambled shock (5 s duration, 0.065 w) was delivered
through the grid ¯oor. latency to cross into the dark
compartment (training latency) was recorded. few rats failed
to move into the dark compartment within 300 s (cut-o
latency). in this case the door was reopened and the rats were
gently moved by the experimenter into the dark compartment,
where they received the foot-shock. after the shock, the rats
were immediately removed from the pa apparatus.
retention was tested 24 h later (day 2). the animals were
placed into the light (safe) compartment, with access to the
dark one (within 15 s) for a period of 300 s. the latency to
cross into the dark compartment with all four feet was
automatically measured (retention latency).
in most of the experiments, the drugs were injected prior to
the training session. a separate experiment was designed to
study the action of ndo 008 on pa retention in a statedependent learning paradigm. this paradigm was used since it
is well established that the drug-state at training and testing
can markedly in¯uence retention performance in aversive
learning tasks (overton, 1966). thus, the animal may only be

i. misane et al

able to retrieve the memory at the time of retention testing
when the same drug-treatment is given both prior to
acquisition and retention testing. therefore, the compound
was administered either prior to training (day 1) or prior to
retention (day 2) or both prior to training and retention (day 1
and 2). in addition, a group of rats also received ndo 008
immediately after training to investigate possible eects on
memory consolidation.

head-twitches
in a separate experiment the ability of the 5-ht agonists to
induce head-twitches was studied. the head-twitch response is
a component of the 5-ht syndrome and is well-documented as
an in vivo model of postsynaptic  xxxg1113xxx  function
(oègren et al., 1982; peroutka & snyder, 1982).
the rats were placed in macrolon1 cages of the same size as
their home cages. each cage contained six rats from each
treatment group. the animals were injected with r(+)-8-ohdpat, ndo 008 or dob and placed back into the same cage.
the number of head-twitches were counted for a total period
of 20 min (10 ± 30 min post-injection) as described previously
(oègren et al., 1982).

drugs
the following compounds were used in the present study: 3dipropylamino-5-hydroxychroman hydrochloride, ndo 008
(astra arcus ab, soèdertaèlje, sweden); two enantiomers of 8hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide, r(+)-8oh-dpat and s(7)-8-oh-dpat, respectively (kindly
supplied by dr lars erik arvidsson, department of organic
pharmaceutical chemistry, university of uppsala, sweden);
s(+) - n - tert - butyl-3-(4 - (2-methoxyphenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl-2phenylpropionamide dihydrochloride, s(+)-way 100135
(wyeth research, taplow, u.k.); d(+)- xxxd123xxx  hydrogen
tartrate monohydrate (haèssle, moèlndal, sweden); l(7) xxxd123xxx  hydrogen tartrate monohydrate (haèssle, moèlndal,
sweden); (+)-1-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride, dob (synthesized by dr lennart
florvall, astra arcus ab, soèdertaèlje, sweden); dl(+)-pchlorophenylalanine, pcpa (labkemi, stockholm, sweden);
 xxxd2419xxx  (jansen, beerse, belgium); pirenperone
(janssen, beerse, belgium); metoprolol tartrate (haèssle,
moèlndal, sweden); ici 118551 hydrochloride (ici, maccles®eld, u.k.).
all the drugs with the exception of pirenperone,  xxxd2419xxx 
and pcpa were dissolved in saline (nacl 0.9%). pirenperone
and  xxxd2419xxx  were dissolved in a few drops of acetic acid and
distilled water and the ph was adjusted to 5.5. the test-drugs
were administered s.c. or i.p. (as indicated in the figure
legends) in volumes of 2 ml kg71 or 5 ml kg71, respectively.
the 5-ht agonists ndo 008, r(+)- and s(7)-8-oh-dpat
and dob were administered 10 min before pa training (if not
otherwise indicated). with respect to the combination studies,
the dierent receptor antagonists were administered at the
following times before pa training:  xxxd2419xxx  at 20 min,
s(+)-way 100135 at 30 min and ici 118551, metoprolol,
pirenperone, and d(+)- and l(7)- xxxd123xxx  at 40 min. all
the control rats received saline (nacl 0.9%) injections and
they were run concurrently with drug-treated groups. pcpa
was suspended in 1%  xxxd2609xxx  and administered for
three consecutive days at the doses 200 mg kg71 on the ®rst
day and 100 mg kg71 on the second and third days (for
method description, see oègren, 1985a). the animals were
exposed to pa training one day after the last pcpa injection.

statistics
the data obtained in the passive avoidance studies including
the counts of rearing were analysed using kruskal-wallis nonparametric anova. post hoc testing with pair-wise comparisons between control groups and drug-treated groups were
performed by mann-whitney u-test using the bonferronicorrection for multiple comparisons. head-twitch data were
analysed by parametric one-way anova followed by
dunnett's t-test (kirk, 1968). a probability level of p50.05
was accepted as statistically signi®cant. corresponding levels
of probability considered for their signi®cance in the passive
avoidance and head-twitch studies are shown in the figures.

results
dose-related eects of 5-ht1a agonists on pa retention
figure 1 shows that when tested 24 h after training, the
retention latencies in the saline-treated control groups were
very high indicating that the animals had acquired the task. in
contrast, rats treated with the r(+)- (figure 1a) and s(7)enantiomers (figure 1b) of 8-oh-dpat prior to training
displayed a dose-related decrease in retention latencies
(kruskal-wallis anova: h(7)=39.0; p50.001 for r(+)-8oh-dpat and h(5)=23.5; p50.001 for s(7)-8-oh-dpat,
respectively). r(+)-8-oh-dpat was about four times more
active than s(7)-8-oh-dpat, producing a signi®cant eect
from the 0.06 mg kg71 dose (p50.05, mann-whitney u-test)
while s(7)-8-oh-dpat was eective from the 0.25 mg kg71
dose (p50.02).
neither r(+)-8-oh-dpat nor s(7)-8-oh-dpat affected the training latency in crossing to the dark compartment
on day 1 (table 1).
similarly to the enantiomers of 8-oh-dpat, ndo 008
induced a dose-related impairment of pa retention:
h(4)=25.1; p50.001. a signi®cant eect was found from the
0.25 mg kg71 dose (p50.002) (figure 2). no signi®cant
dierences were found between control and ndo 008-treated
rats with regard to the training latencies (table 1).
based on the dose-response experiments, the 0.13 mg kg71
dose of r(+)-8-oh-dpat and the 0.25 and 0.5 mg kg71
doses of ndo 008 were chosen for all subsequent interaction
studies in the pa test.

eects of the 5-ht1a antagonists, b-adrenoceptor
antagonists and 5-ht2a/2c antagonists in counteracting
impairment of pa induced by 5-ht1a agonists
neither d(+)- xxxd123xxx  (non-selective b1, b2 and b3 receptor
blocker) (4 ± 8 mg kg71, s.c.); l(7)- xxxd123xxx  (non-selective
b-adrenoceptor/ xxxg1108xxx  antagonist) (4 ± 8 mg kg71,
s.c.) nor s(+)-way 100135 (selective  xxxg1108xxx 
antagonist) (1 ± 10 mg kg71, s.c.) when injected prior to
training, signi®cantly aected pa retention by themselves
(data not shown).
pretreatment with s(+)-way 100135 (3 and 10 mg kg71)
completely blocked the de®cit of pa caused by r(+)-8-ohdpat (0.13 mg kg71, s.c.) (figure 3a). similarly, l(7) xxxd123xxx  (4 mg kg71) fully antagonized the impairment of
pa by both r(+)-8-oh-dpat (0.13 mg kg71) and ndo 008
(0.25 and 0.5 mg kg71, s.c.) (figure 3b). in contrast, the

502

i. misane et al

d(+)-form of  xxxd123xxx  failed to attenuate the disruptive
eects of ndo 008 (0.5 mg kg71) (figure 3b).
figure 4 shows that neither the b1-selective antagonist
metoprolol (4 mg kg71, i.p.), the b2-selective antagonist ici
118551 (4 mg kg71, i.p.) nor the 5-ht2a/2c nonselective
antagonists  xxxd2419xxx  (1 mg kg71, i.p.) and pirenperone
(0.1 mg kg71, i.p.) antagonized the impairment of pa retention
by ndo 008 (0.5 mg kg71) when administered prior to pa
training. in addition,  xxxd2419xxx  (1 mg kg71) did not attenuate
the inhibitory eects of r(+)-8-oh-dpat (0.13 mg kg71)
(figure 4). none of b-adrenergic or 5-ht2a/2c antagonists
tested had any signi®cant eect on pa retention by themselves.

eects of pcpa-induced brain 5-ht depletion on the
impairment of pa retention induced by ndo 008 and
r(+)-8-oh-dpat
figure 5 shows that the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor
pcpa by itself (200+100+100 mg kg71, i.p., for three

the  xxxg1108xxx  involvement in passive avoidance

consecutive days) did not aect pa retention. the impairment
of pa caused by ndo 008 (0.5 mg kg71, s.c.) or r(+)-8-ohdpat (0.13 mg kg71, s.c.) was not modi®ed by pcpapretreatment.

role of 5-ht2a receptors in pa and head-twitch
response
figure 6 shows that dob (0.1 ± 2.0 mg kg71, s.c.) injected
prior to training induced an impairment of pa retention only
at the highest dose tested (2.0 mg kg71) (p50.01) without
aecting pa training latency (table 1).
the eect of dob on pa retention was compared with its
ability to induce head-twitches. dob (0.0025 ± 0.1 mg kg71)
induced a dose-related increase in number of head-twitches:
f(6,35)=14.7, p50.005. the minimum eective dose revealed
in these studies was 0.01 mg kg71 (p50.01, dunnett's t-test),
(figure 7a), i.e. 200 fold lower than the dose which disrupted
pa retention. neither r(+)-8-oh-dpat (0.1 ± 1.0 mg kg71)
nor ndo 008 (0.25 ± 5.0 mg kg71) induced head-twitches at
the dose range which impaired pa retention (figure 7b).

evaluation of state-dependent learning in pa
the eects of ndo 008 (0.5 mg kg71, s.c.) were examined in a
state-dependent learning paradigm. kruskal-wallis anova
revealed signi®cant main eect of ndo 008-treatment for the
pa retention: h(4)=26.6; p50.002. the de®cit of pa
retention was seen in animals treated with ndo 008 both
prior to training or prior to retention as well as prior to both
training and retention (figure 8). on the other hand, when
injected immediately after training, ndo 008 did not aect
retention.

behavioural observations in pa

figure 1 the dose-related eects of the two enantiomers of 8-ohdpat on passive avoidance (pa) retention in the rat. r(+)-8-ohdpat (0.03 ± 2.0 mg kg71, s.c.) (a) and s(7)-8-oh-dpat (0.13 ±
2.0 mg kg71, s.c.) (b) were administered 10 min before the training
session (exposure to unescapable foot-shock). the retention test was
performed 24 h later. vertical bars represent medians of retention
latencies. maximal time of latency was set at 300 s (cut-o time). the
statistical analysis was performed by kruskal-wallis anova.
pairwise comparisons with a corresponding saline control group
were made using mann-whitney u-test with the bonferronicorrection for multiple comparisons (*p50.05, **p50.02,
***p50.002, n=8).

both, r(+)-8-oh-dpat (0.03 ± 2.0 mg kg71, s.c.) and s(7)8-oh-dpat (0.13 ± 2.0 mg kg71, s.c.) injected 10 min prior
to the observation period in the pa apparatus induced a
dose-related development of the 5-ht syndrome. the ®rst
signs of 5-ht syndrome (lower lip retraction, ¯at body
posture, reciprocal forepaw treading) were noted at the
0.06 mg kg71 and 0.13 mg kg71 doses of r(+)- and s(7)-8oh-dpat, respectively. all the components of 5-ht
syndrome (lower lip retraction, reciprocal forepaw treading,
head weaving, ¯at body posture and hind limb abduction)
but not tremor were present from the 0.13 mg kg71 dose of
r(+)-8-oh-dpat and 0.25 mg kg71 dose of s(7)-8-ohdpat. the further increase in doses resulted in aggravation
of 5-ht syndrome symptomology. a progressive decrease in
cage-supported rearing up to complete abolishment and
increase in forward locomotion correlated with the severity
of the 5-ht syndrome and was seen at the same dose-range.
the lowest 0.03 mg kg71 dose of r(+)-8-oh-dpat failed
to produce visually detectable signs of the 5-ht syndrome
and it did not alter rearing. a quantitative analysis of 5-ht
syndrome and rearing was performed in the dose-response
studies of ndo 008 (0.1 ± 1.0 mg kg71, s.c.) and dob (0.1 ±
2.0 mg kg71, s.c.) as presented in table 2.
the threshold-dose of ndo 008 to induce the 5-ht
syndrome was 0.25 mg kg71. scores close to maximum for all
the components of the 5-ht syndrome (except tremor) were
found at the 0.5 ± 1.0 mg kg71 dose-range of ndo 008. in
addition, a dose-related decrease in rearing up to complete
abolishment was seen in the ndo 008-treated animals from
the 0.25 mg kg71 dose (table 2).

the 5-ht agonists were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 10 min prior to pa training. the values shown are median durations
(corresponding interquartile ranges (iqr) shown in parentheses). statistical analysis was performed by kruskal-wallis anova (hratios shown). mann-whitney u-test with the bonferroni-correction (n=6±10) was used to compare the dierent treatments of 5-ht
agonists versus corresponding saline controls (0). p values not shown because of their non-signi®cance (n.s.:p40.05). for details, see

agonists or dob demonstrated an increase in arousal (startle
response to sudden noise). the threshold doses were as
follows: 0.13 mg kg71 for r(+)-8-oh-dpat; 0.5 mg kg71
for s(7)-8-oh-dpat; 0.25 mg kg71 for ndo 008 and
2.0 mg kg71 dob.
in combination studies, the 5-ht syndrome was blocked by
s(+)-way 100135 (3 ± 10 mg kg71) and l(7)- xxxd123xxx 
(4 mg kg71) but not by d(+)- xxxd123xxx  (4 mg kg71),

figure 2 the dose-related eects of ndo 008 on pa retention in
the rat. rats were injected with ndo 008 (0.1 ± 1.0 mg kg71, s.c.)
10 min before the training session. the retention test was performed
24 h later. vertical bars represent medians of retention latencies
(***p50.002 versus saline control group, n=6). for details of
statistical analysis and general information, see legend to figure 1.

dob induced the 5-ht syndrome from the 1.0 mg kg71
dose. unlike ndo 008, lower lip retraction was not seen and
head-weaving was occasional in dob-treated animals. tremor
and a marked decrease of locomotor activity was noted at the
highest dose of dob (2.0 mg kg71). in addition, respiration
was heavy and forced and some of the rats chewed vacuously
(1.0 and 2.0 mg kg71 doses). dob also reduced the number of
rearings and a signi®cant eect was found at the lowest
0.1 mg kg71 dose (p50.05, mann-whitney u-test) (table 2).
in addition, the animals treated with any of the 5-ht1a

in agreement with earlier reports (carli et al., 1992; jackson et
al., 1994; riekkinen, 1994), the selective 5-ht1a-receptor
agonist 8-oh-dpat (both r(+)- and s(7)-enantiomers)
administered prior to training produced a dose-dependent
impairment of pa retention when tested 24 h later. the doseresponse curves clearly indicated that r(+)-8-oh-dpat was
about four times more eective than s(7)-8-oh-dpat.
however, these dierences could not be directly related to
changes in preference for the dark compartment since none of
enantiomers aected the training latency (day 1). another
potent and selective 5-ht1a agonist, the chroman analogue
ndo 008, which is chemically related to 8-oh-dpat
(thorberg et al., 1987), also had disruptive eects on pa
retention.
since drug-states at both training and retention tests are
known to in¯uence subsequent retention performance in
aversive learning tasks (overton, 1966), the eects of ndo
008 were examined in a state-dependent learning paradigm.
ndo 008 was found to impair pa retrieval when given prior
to retention. on the other hand, direct eects of ndo 008 on
memory consolidation does not seem likely since post-training
administration of ndo 008 did not aect pa retention when
tested 24 h later. interestingly, our ®ndings are only partly in
agreement with previously reported data (carli et al., 1992;
riekkinen, 1994) showing that 8-oh-dpat produced a
marked de®cit of pa retention when administered before

504

training or retention but also when injected after training
(post-training injections varied from 0 ± 30 min). however,
according to a recent report (carli et al., 1993), impairment of
pa retention was found following pre-training but not posttraining (5 min) administration of 8-oh-dpat into the ca1
region of the dorsal hippocampus. taken together, the
present data indicate that stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors
results in interference with acquisition processes important for
avoidance learning and with the processing of information
from short- to long-term memory. activation of 5-ht1a
receptors, on the other hand, appears not to interfere with the
post-trial consolidation processes. however, 5-ht1a receptors
appear to be involved in memory retrieval of an aversive
experience.
a major problem in studying the role of 5-ht in aversive
learning and memory is that changes in 5-ht neurotransmission can alter sensorimotor reactivity (davis et al., 1980). it is
well-documented that 5-ht1a agonists induce multiple
behavioural eects, e.g. modulate both general locomotor

activity (dourish et al., 1985; curzon, 1990; evenden &
angeby-moller, 1990), nociceptive thresholds (hamon et al.,
1990) and elicit a characteristic behavioural syndrome (5-ht
syndrome) (tricklebank et al., 1984; berendsen et al., 1989;
blanchard et al., 1993). therefore, it is quite possible that these
factors may interfere with learning performance (oègren,
1985b) by alteration of sensory input at the initial stage of
information processing. changes in nociceptive thresholds, e.g.
¯inch and jump threshold elicited by electric shock, have been
reported to be reduced at the doses of 8-oh-dpat producing
impairment of pa (carli et al., 1992). however, alterations in
shock-sensitivity (or rather its expression, i.e. reactivity to
shock) are not likely to explain the present results. thus, it was
observed that the animals reacted to the shock, mostly by a
¯inch response or by moving, sometimes vocalizing. it should
be emphasized that the shock used in the present study was
scrambled and its level was well above the threshold for a
¯inch response (withdrawal of forepaws from the grid ¯oor).
moreover, the increased startle-response was observed at the
high doses of r(+)- and s(7)-8-oh-dpat and ndo 008
which induced both a loss of pa retention and a progressive
development of the 5-ht syndrome. these observations
suggest that the actual perception of shock might be increased
rather than suppressed by 5-ht1a agonists.
the present data have provided strong evidence for the view
that both 8-oh dpat and ndo 008 produced their eects on
pa via stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors. both the non-selective
b-adrenoceptor/5-ht1a antagonist l(7)- xxxd123xxx  (nahorski
& willcocks, 1983; middlemiss et al., 1985, 1986) and the
selective  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist s(+)-way 100135
(fletcher et al., 1993) completely blocked the impairment of

pa retention and the 5-ht behavioural syndrome as well as
the decrease in the rearing induced by ndo 008 and r(+)-8oh-dpat. interestingly, the blockade of 5-ht1a receptors by
l(7)- xxxd123xxx  and s(+)-way 100135 itself failed to
produce any signi®cant changes in retention suggesting that
the 5-ht1a receptors play a permissive role in this behavioural
task. consistent with the above interpretation, the 5-ht2a/2c
antagonists,  xxxd2419xxx  and pirenperone (leysen et al., 1982;
1984; pawlowski et al., 1983; hoyer et al., 1994), both given at
doses which blocked brain 5-ht2a/2c receptor actions in vivo
(oègren, 1986b), failed to reverse the actions of ndo 008 and
8-oh-dpat. therefore, 5-ht1a receptors rather than 5-ht2a
receptors seem to be involved in the modulation of pa. this
conclusion was further corroborated by the results obtained
with dob, a non-selective 5-ht2a/2c receptor agonist
(glennon et al., 1984; titeler et al., 1985; titeler & lyon,
1987). dob was found to be very eective in inducing headtwitches, a response attributed to postsynaptic 5-ht2a
receptor stimulation (oègren et al., 1982; peroutka & snyder,
1982) from the 0.01 mg kg71 dose while a 200 fold higher dose
was needed to induce impairment of pa retention. however,
this impairment might be due to the observed toxic eects of
dob or the hallucinogenic properties of the compound
(martin & sloan, 1986; glennon et al., 1992). the possible
role of the 5-ht2c receptors in the inhibitory action of dob
awaits further studies.
8-oh-dpat is a relatively selective 5-ht1a agonist with at
least ten times higher anity for the  xxxg1108xxx  than for
any other receptor type according to the available radioligandbinding data (hoyer et al., 1994). recent results show that
8-oh-dpat also possesses a relatively high anity for the

cloned rat and human 5-ht7 receptors (ruat et al., 1993;
boess & martin, 1994;  xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1997). therefore, an
involvement of this receptor subtype in the actions of 8-ohdpat could be hypothesized but seems unlikely. firstly,
s(+)-way 100135, which completely antagonized the 8-ohdpat-induced impairment in the pa task, has a negligible
anity for the 5-ht7 receptor (hoyer et al., 1994; routledge,

selective 5-ht2a/2c antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  with a slightly lower
anity for the 5-ht7 receptor than 8-oh-dpat (hoyer et al.,
1994) did not counteract the inhibitory eect of r(+)-8-ohdpat in the pa test.
many 5-ht1a ligands currently used as pharmacological
tools also have notable anities for b-adrenoceptors (hjorth &
carlsson, 1986; sanchez et al., 1996). however, in these studies
none of the antagonists with a preferential binding to badrenoceptors, i.e. the b1-selective antagonist metoprolol or
the b2-selective antagonist ici 118551 (nahorski & willcocks,
1983; bylund et al., 1994; hieble et al., 1995; ruolo et al.,
1995) or d(+)- xxxd123xxx  (b-adrenoceptor blocker nearly
equipotent at (b1, b2, and b3 sites) (middlemiss, 1986)
antagonized the eects of either r(+)-8-oh-dpat or ndo
008. the importance of the relative selectivity for 5-ht1a
receptors over b-adrenoceptors was illustrated by l(7) xxxd123xxx .
the role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic 5-ht1a
receptors in the disruptive actions of ndo 008 and 8-ohdpat in pa are of particular importance for the analysis of
mechanisms underlying aversive conditioning. some investigators have suggested that the eects of 5-ht1a agonists on
aversive learning processes such as licking suppression or
conditioned emotional responses (cer) (schreiber & de vry,
1993) or the anticon¯ict action of 8-oh-dpat (engel et al.,
1984) are related to stimulation of presynaptic 5-ht1a
receptors. the present data, on the other hand, support the
view that the impaired pa retention caused by the 5-ht1a
receptor agonists is mainly due to stimulation of postsynaptic
5-ht1a receptors. firstly, both ndo 008 and 8-oh-dpat
induced the 5-ht syndrome indicative of a stimulation of
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors (goodwin et al., 1987; curzon,
1990) at the dose range at which they inhibited pa.
furthermore, s(+)-way 100135 completely antagonized
both the impairment of pa retention and the 5-ht syndrome
induced by r(+)-8-oh-dpat. secondly, inhibition of 5-ht
synthesis by pcpa did not have any signi®cant eect on pa.
pcpa markedly reduces the pool of available 5-ht in the
presynaptic neurones (koe & weissman, 1966). thus, the
treatment paradigm with pcpa used in the present study has
been reported to result in about 80 ± 90% 5-ht depletion in
the rat brain (oègren, 1985b). in the present study pretreatment

the 5-ht syndrome was scored and number of rearings was counted in the pa apparatus during a 3 min exploration period prior to
training (day 1). the 5-ht agonists were administered subcutaneously (s.c.) 10 min prior to observations (n=6±9 animals/group).
intensity scores of 5-ht syndrome were as follows: 0=absent, 1=equivocal, 2=present and 3=intense. the presented values for the
5-ht syndrome and rearing are medians (for rearing corresponding interquartile ranges (iqr) shown in parentheses). statistical
analysis for rearing was performed by kruskal-wallis anova: h(4)=22.1, p50.002 and h(3)=24.7, p50.002 for ndo 008- and

i. misane et al

with pcpa attenuated neither the 5-ht syndrome nor the
de®cit of pa induced by ndo 008 or r(+)-8-oh-dpat.
therefore, reduced impulse ¯ow and/or diminished 5-ht
availability resulting from any presynaptic action of ndo 008
or 8-oh-dpat on serotonergic neurones appears not to be
sucient to alter pa retention.
however, the contribution of the presynaptic 5-ht receptor
mechanisms (5-ht1a-related or non-related) in the regulation
of pa behaviour requires further analysis. it cannot be
excluded that the inhibitory action of 8-oh-dpat on pa
also involves the recently discovered 5-ht1a binding sites
(5-ht1alow sites), apparently localized on the presynaptic
5-ht terminals both in the hippocampus and cortex
(nenonene et al., 1994). these 5-ht1a binding sites which are
recognized by 8-oh-dpat must be distinguished from
classical postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors (5-ht1ahigh sites).
thus, these novel 5-ht1alow sites are not aected by pcpa,
but `disappear' following pca-induced destruction of 5-ht
terminals (nenonene et al., 1994). these particular binding
sites must also be distinguished from 5-ht terminal
autoreceptors of the 5-ht1b type (martin & sanders-bush,
1982; hartig et al., 1996) which are little aected by 8-ohdpat or ndo 008 (hoyer et al., 1985, 1994; engel et al.,
1986).
consistent with previous data on 5-ht receptor activity in
vivo (arvidsson et al., 1981; 1984; bjoèrk et al., 1989; corn®eld
et al., 1991; hadrava et al., 1996), the two enantiomers of
8-oh-dpat diered, since r(+)-8-oh-dpat was about
four times more eective than s(7)-8-oh-dpat to impair
pa retention. this dierence in eectiveness is in agreement
with electrophysiological studies showing that the r(+)enantiomer is 2 ± 3 times more potent than s(7)-8-oh-dpat
in suppressing the neuronal ®ring both at the level of the dorsal
raphe (lejeune et al., 1997) and in the dorsal hippocampus
(ca3 area) (hadrava et al., 1996), thus indicating a greater

507

agonistic activity of r(+)-8-oh-dpat. since receptor
binding studies have revealed no signi®cant dierences of the
two enantiomers in terms of their anity for the 5-ht1a
receptor (lejeune et al., 1997), a role of stereoselectivity in
their intrinsic activity and coupling to g-proteins must be
considered (bjoèrk et al., 1989; corn®eld et al., 1991).
interestingly, the r(+)-and s(7)- enantiomers of 8-ohdpat have been shown to behave as full and partial agonists,
respectively, in inhibiting  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production at postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in the hippocampus
(corn®eld et al., 1991; foreman et al., 1995). however,
recently both enantiomers of 8-oh-dpat have been reported
to act as partial agonists in antagonizing the eect of 5-ht at
the postsynaptic hippocampal ca3 neurones (hadrava et al.,
1996). therefore, it is possible that the dierent biological
activities of the r(+)- and s(7)-isomers of 8-oh-dpat
re¯ect variations in the  xxxg1108xxx  coupling to multiple
g-proteins.
taken together, the present data indicate that the de®cit of
pa retention induced by the 5-ht1a agonists is due to
stimulation of the postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors. the 5-ht1a
receptor stimulation appears to interfere with learning
processes operating at both acquisition and retrieval.
