abstract
the molecular interaction of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  with the l3-cell sulfonylurea receptor was investigated
by kinetic and steady state binding as well as photoaffinity labeling. the novel sulfonylurea,  xxxd2203xxx , exhibits a
significantly higher exchange rate with the sulfonylurea receptor but a 2.5-3 fold lower binding affinity compared to
 xxxd2215xxx . [3h] xxxd2203xxx  was specifically incorporated into a 65-kda polypeptide under conditions which led
to predominant labeling of a 140-kda protein by [3h] xxxd2215xxx . labeling of the 140-kda protein by
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  was inhibited by unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  and, vice versa,  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited labeling of the
65-kda protein by [3h] xxxd2203xxx . the 65-kda protein was also specifically photolabeled by the sulfonylurea
[1251]35623, whereas an 4-azidobenzoyl derivative of  xxxd2215xxx , n r[3h]33055, exclusively labeled a 33-kda
protein. solubilization of l3-cell tumor membranes led to a shift of specific [3h] xxxd2215xxx -binding from the
140-kda to the 65-kda protein, exclusively and to an increased labeling of the 65-kda protein by [3h] xxxd2203xxx .
the labeling of a unique protein is in agreement with similar kd-values for binding to the sulfonylurea receptor
measured for both sulfonylureas upon solubilization of l3-cell membranes. photoaffinity labeling of intact cultured
l3-ceus led also to labeling of a 140-kda protein by [3h] xxxd2215xxx  and of a 65-kda protein by [3hlglimepiride.
these studies suggest that the l3-cell sulfonylurea receptor consists of at least two protein subunits of m t 140000 and
65000 which bind sulfonylureas of different structure with different binding affinities and kinetic parameters.
furthermore, the exchange rate of a sulfonylurea determines the insulin releasing activity in vitro more closely than
the binding affinity.

stimulation of insulin release from the pancreas.
according to the present view sulfonylurea drugs
bind to a specific receptor at the plasma membrane of the insulin-secreting f3-cell leading to an
inhibition of an atp-dependent kt-channel
[1-5]. whether the sulfonylurea receptor is identical with the atp-dependent kt-channel is discussed controversially. the inhibition of k +-efflux

and the resulting cell depolarization opens voltage-dependent ca 2 + -channels and the resulting
increase of intracellular cal + -levels finally triggers the secretion of insulin ([6-8], fig. 1). it is
generally accepted that all sulfonylurea drugs interact with a common receptor in the f3-cell
membrane [9] and that the binding affinity of
sulfonylureas to the f3-cell sulfonylurea receptor
is directly proportional to their half-inhibition of
the katp-channel, to their insulin-releasing activity as well as to their hypoglycemic potential in
vivo [4,9-12].  xxxd2203xxx  cblamaryl) is a new
hypoglycemic agent for the treatment of niddm
(fig. 2). despite a 2-3 fold higher blood glucose
lowering potency in humans and dogs compared
to  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2203xxx  at equipotent concentrations leads to a significantly lower insulin
secretion [13]. in the isolated rat pancreas however,  xxxd2203xxx  released more insulin than
 xxxd2215xxx . whether this higher insulin-releasing activity of  xxxd2203xxx  in the rat is reflected in
the interaction with the rat f3-cell sulfonylurea
receptor on a molecular level we performed binding studies and photoaffinity labeling experiments

2. results and discussion
2.1. characterization of the binding of  xxxd2203xxx 
and  xxxd2215xxx  to the {3-cell sulfonylurea receptor

competitive binding studies of sulfonylureas
with plasma membranes from f3-cell tumors or
rinm5f cells as well as with intact rinm5f cells
demonstrated that lower concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx  compared to  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx 
were necessary to displace both, radiolabeled
 xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx  from the f3-cell
sulfonylurea receptor (fig. 3). this indicates an
apparent lower affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  to the sulfonylurea receptor compared to  xxxd2215xxx .
thus, the higher insulin secretion in isolated rat
pancreas cannot be explained by a higher binding
affinity of  xxxd2203xxx  to the sulfonylurea receptor. we therefore investigated whether
 xxxd2203xxx  and glibenclarnide have different receptor binding kinetics. the affinity of a ligand to

its receptor - measured by the dissociation constant of the ligand-receptor-complex - can be
viewed as a ratio between the velocity constants
of receptor dissociationt -k off ) and receptor association(-k on)[14].  xxxd2203xxx  associates 2.5-3 fold
quicker to the f3-cell sulfonylurea receptor than
 xxxd2215xxx .  xxxd2203xxx  also dissociates 8-9
fold quicker from the receptor than  xxxd2215xxx 
([15], fig. 4). the ratios of the velocity constants
for dissociation and association koff/k on therefore directly reflect the differences in the dissociation constants k 0 of both drugs for the {3-cell
sulfonylurea receptor. scatchard plots derived
from steady state saturation experiments were
curve-linear for both compounds suggesting the
existence of both high- and low-affinity sites for
 xxxd2203xxx  as well as for  xxxd2215xxx  (fig. 5).
competitive scatchard analysis, however, where
unlabeled  xxxd2215xxx  was used to displace radiolabeled  xxxd2203xxx  and vice versa unlabeled
 xxxd2203xxx  to displace radiolabeled glibenc1amide, resulted in non-linear concavely shaped
plots which indicate different high-affinity binding
sites for  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  at the

{3-cell membrane.
2.2. photoaffinity labeling of the {3-cell sulfonylurea
receptor
further evidence for different receptor sites of
 xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  in pancreatic {3-cell
membranes were obtained from photoaffinity
labeling studies. for the identification of the respective binding sites by photoaffinity labeling a
covalent crosslinking between the ligands and
their binding sites upon irradiation with ultraviolet light must occur. to investigate the usefulness
of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  for photoaffinity
labeling, their covalent crosslinking to their carrier protein in blood - albumin, upon irradiation
with monochromatic light was investigated. irradiation of radiolabeled  xxxd2203xxx  or  xxxd2215xxx  revealed a similar wavelength dependence for photocrosslinking into proteins [16] indicating a similar photochemical mechanism of
covalent crosslinking to proteins. the use of the
drugs [0 h] xxxd2203xxx  and [oh]glibendamide itself for direct photoaffinity labeling studies has
advantages toward classical photoaffinity labeling

incubated for 45 min at 2yc with 2 nm [3h] xxxd2203xxx  (left panel) or 2 nm [3h] xxxd2215xxx  (right panel) in the absence and the
presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd3394xxx . afterwards, the suspensions were
rapidly filtered through whatman of if filters and radioactivity retained on the membranes was measured by liquid scintillation
counting [15]. corrections were made for unspecific binding by measuring [3h]sulfonylurea binding in the presence of 2 j-lm
unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  or  xxxd2215xxx , respectively. specific binding was calculated as difference between total and non-specific
binding.

with chemically modified ligands. the physiological interactions of the respective drugs with their
specific receptors are not at all disturbed, whereas
the introduction of further photolabile groups for
photocrosslinking such as aromatic azido groups
into these drugs might change the normal molecular interaction of these ligands with their receptors carrying the risk of misinterpretations of the
real interactions.
photoaffinity labeling of f3-cell membranes with
radiolabeled  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx 
showed quite different labeling patterns. with
[3h] xxxd2215xxx  an incorporation of the probe
into two membrane polypeptides of m, 140000
and 33000 occured ([17], fig. 6, right panel). in
contrast, [3h] xxxd2203xxx  led to a covalent modification predominantly of only one polypeptide of
m, 65000 whereas the 140-kda  xxxd2215xxx 
binding protein was not labeled (fig. 6, left panel).

in order to elucidate whether these binding proteins for  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  are also
physiologically involved in the binding of sulfonylureas, photolabeling experiments with intact
rinm5f cells were performed. as with f3-cell
membranes,  xxxd2203xxx  was incorporated exclusively into a 65-kda protein and  xxxd2215xxx 
into a 140-kda protein demonstrating that also in
intact f3-cells,  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  have
access to different binding proteins. the specificity of these binding proteins was investigated by
competition labeling experiments where increasing concentrations of unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  or
 xxxd2215xxx  are present during photoaffinity
labeling either with [3h] xxxd2203xxx  or
[3h] xxxd2215xxx , respectively. the labeling of
the 140-kda  xxxd2215xxx  binding protein was
concentration-dependently inhibited by both,
 xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2203xxx , despite the fact

140-kda  xxxd2215xxx  binding protein (fig. 7).
vice versa, the labeling of the 65-kda  xxxd2203xxx 
binding protein was also concentration-dependently inhibited by  xxxd2203xxx  and other sulfonylureas such as  xxxd2215xxx  or  xxxd3394xxx  despite the fact that  xxxd2215xxx  does not directly
bind to the 65-kda  xxxd2203xxx  binding protein
(fig. 8).
further insights into the structure of the ,b-cell
sulfonylurea receptor were obtained with additional photolabile derivatives of sulfonylureas (fig.
9).

of

iodinated 35 623, led - as  xxxd2203xxx  - to an
exclusive labeling of the 65-kda protein (fig. 10,
left panel) whereas with the azidobenzoyl-derivative of  xxxd2215xxx  an exclusive labeling of a
33-kda protein was obtained (fig. 10, right panel).
the labeling of the 65-kda protein could be
inhibited by other sulfonylureas whereas the
labeling of the 33-kda protein was only slightly
inhibited at millimolar concentrations of sulfonylure as suggesting that the 33-kda protein is not a
specific sulfonylurea binding protein. the 2-hydroxy-5-iodo-derivative of  xxxd2215xxx  used by
aguilar-bryan [18] led to the specific labeling of
polypeptides of m r 140 kda, 65 kda, 55 kda and
30 kda, the 140-kda polypeptide being mostly
labeled. the polypeptides of m r 140 kda, 65 kda

fig. 10. photoaffinity labeling of j3-cell membranes with the photolabile sulfonylureas [1251]35623 and [3h]n3,33055. j3-cell tumor
membranes (500 f-lg of protein) were incubated at 20°c for 15 min either with 27.6 nm p25i]35623 (left panel) or 51 nm

and the distribution of radiolabeled polypeptides was determined by autoradiography (p25i]35623) or by liquid scintillation counting

and 55 kda could be inhibited by  xxxd2215xxx 
and the 140-kda polypeptide was identified as the
putative sulfonylurea high affinity binding site
[18]. the introduction of a further aromatic azido
group into this molecule led to the labeling of a
variety of proteins. polypeptides of m, 160-175
kda, 92 kda, 64 kda, 55 kda, 38 kda, 31 kda, 29
kda and 20 kda were labeled; in the presence of
unlabeled  xxxd2215xxx , the labeling of the polypeptides of m, 160-175 kda and 38-kda was
inhibited [19]. the labeling of such a great number of membrane proteins by a high-affinity ligand suggests considerable unspecific labeling of
membrane proteins caused by long-living
nitrene-interm ediates. nevertheless,
schwanstecher and coworkers claim a 38-kda polypeptide as the high affinity sulfonylurea receptor [19].
a comparison of the labeling patterns shows
that the photoprobes containing a cyclohexylamino moiety preferably label the 140-kda protein. in contrast, the compounds preferably labeling the 65-kda protein contain a 4-trans-methylcyclohexylamino residue. this small structural
difference as is evident from the space-filling
models of these compounds (fig. 11) seems to
direct binding of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  to
the 65-kda or the 140-kda protein, respectively.
2.3. effect of membrane solubilisation on receptor
binding and photoaffinity labeling
these findings from photolabeling studies are
in accordance with the hypothesis that the sulfonylurea receptor consists at least of two protein
subunits of m, 140 kda and 65 kda which interact with each other in a cooperative manner.
sulfonylureas of different structure may have
different access to these subunits embedded in
the f3-cell plasma membrane. to study the putative interaction of different sulfonylurea binding
sites the effect of solubilisation of the f3-cell
membrane on binding of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  to the sulfonylurea receptor was investigated. the non-linear concavely shaped curves in
the competitive scatchard plots were converted
into linear ones upon solubilization (fig. 12). this
suggests the disruption of the co operative interaction between the  xxxd2203xxx  and the  xxxd2215xxx  binding sites. analysis of the receptor

fig. 11. space-filling models of the sulfonylureas  xxxd2203xxx ,
 xxxd2215xxx  n,-33055 and 1-35623

binding kinetics revealed that the binding affinity
of  xxxd2203xxx  increased up to the value for
 xxxd2215xxx , due to changes of the association
and dissociation kinetics, shown for association in
fig. 13. in contrast, receptor binding kinetics of
 xxxd2215xxx  remained largely unaffected upon
solubilization (fig. 13). solubilization of the f3-cell
membrane dramatically changed the photoaffinity
labeling behaviour of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx . the labeling of the 65-kda protein by

fig. 12. effect of solubilization of j3-cell membranes on competitive scatchard analysis of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  binding to
the sulfonylurea receptor. intact rin m5f cell membranes (upper panels) or solubilized rinm5f membranes (lower panels) (200
ja-g of protein each) were incubated at 20°c for 60 min either 0.5 nm [3h] xxxd2203xxx  (left panels) or 0.5 nm [3h] xxxd2215xxx 
(right panels) in the presence of 0.1-100 nm unlabeled  xxxd2203xxx  or  xxxd2215xxx . protein-associated radioactivity was
determined either by rapid filtration (intact membranes) or precipitation of solubilized proteins with  xxxd2982xxx  prior to
filtration and subsequent liquid scintillation counting.

[3h] xxxd2203xxx  was greatly increased upon solubilization and no additional proteins were labeled
(fig. 14, left panel). this indicates either an increased access of  xxxd2203xxx  to the 65-kda protein such as binding from the inner face of the
plasma membrane and/or a tremendous increase
of the affinity to the 65-kda protein as suggested
by the binding studies. in contrast, the 140-kda
 xxxd2215xxx  binding protein was no longer
labeled after solubilization; instead a nearly exclusive incorporation of the photoprobe into the
65-kda protein occured indicating a shift of
glibenciamide binding from the 140-kda to the
65-kda protein (fig. 14, right panel).
3. conclusions

1. that  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  displace

each other from specific binding to the l3-cell
membrane showing non-linear competitive
scatchard plots,
2. that  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  bind to
distinct binding proteins during photoaffinity
labeling,
3. that the labeling of the  xxxd2203xxx  binding
protein of m, 65 kda is inhibited by glibenciamide and vice versa the labeling of the
glibenciamide binding protein of m, 140 kda
by  xxxd2203xxx  by a mechanism different from
direct ligand competition,
4. that the non-linear competitive scatchard
plots are converted into linear ones upon
membrane solubilization
suggest that in the rat l3-cell:

fig. 13. effect of solubilization of [3-cell membranes on the binding kinetics of  xxxd2203xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  to the sulfonylurea
receptor. association of 2 nm [3hlglimepiride or 2 nm [3h] xxxd2215xxx  to intact j3-cell tumor membranes (upper panel) or
solubilized j3-cell tumor membranes (lower panel) (l00 j.lg of protein each) was measured after the indicated incubation periods.

protein subunits. the 140-kda and 65-kda
subunit bind sulfonylureas with different
binding affinities and different kinetic
parameters.
2. the exchange rate of a sulfonylurea also determines the insulin-releasing activity in vitro.
3. upon solubilization the 140-kda subunit
looses its binding affinity for sulfonylureas
whereas the binding affinity to the 65-kda
protein is increased (fig. 15).
whether the sulfonylurea receptor is identical
with the katp-channel was discussed controversially over the years. recent findings, however,
strongly suggest that the katp-channel and the
sulfonylurea receptor are distinct proteins.
ashford and coworkers [20- 22] demonstrated an uncoupling of the sulfonylurea
receptor binding and the k +-channel activity
by several lines of evidence.
ashford and coworkers reported the expression cloning of a rat heart katp-channel, a

protein of 417 amino acids [23]. in northern
blot analysis with reduced hybridization
stringency, an additional band was detected
in .£3-cells. the cloned channels were activated by k + -channel openers such as  xxxd1868xxx , whereas  xxxd2215xxx  had no effect on
channel activity strongly suggesting the nonidentity of the sulfonylurea receptor and the
k"'tp-channel.
what is known about the hitherto characterized
sulfonylurea binding proteins? from the putative
protein components of the sulfonylurea receptor
a partial sequencing of the n-terminal 350 amino
acids of the 140-kda subunit was reported. according to the work of bryan and coworkers [24]
this protein has no homology to hitherto known
transporters and channels and shows 5 membrane
spanning domains in the n-terminal 350 amino
acids. the 65-kda protein is the specific binding
site for  xxxd2203xxx  and becomes the major sulfonylurea binding site after solubilization [16]. a
38-kda protein was claimed as the sulfonylurea

with 30.76 nm [3hlglimepiride or 48.3 nm eh) xxxd2215xxx  in the dark and subsequently irradiated at 254 nm for 2 min.
afterwards, membrane proteins were separated by sds-page. the distribution of 3h-radioactivity along the gels was determined

receptor by schwanstecher and panten [19]. by
shaw and coworkers a 33-kda  xxxd2215xxx 
binding protein was purified on a  xxxd2215xxx 
affinity column and identified as  xxxg1739xxx  being noncompetitively inhibited by
 xxxd2215xxx  [25]. a 55 kda  xxxd2215xxx  binding protein was identified as  xxxg323xxx  [25].
the role of these sulfonylurea binding proteins
in the regulation of j3-cell katp-channels must be
clarified by co-expression of the respective channel proteins and the different sulfonylurea binding proteins.

for the expression of a putative intrinsic k+ channel activity of the sulfonylurea receptor, these
preliminary observations more likely confirm the
conclusions drawn from our studies that the sulfonylurea binding proteints) and the k+ channel
of the pancreatic j3-cell are different entities.

note added in proof
during the course of manuscript processing the
cdna sequence of the  xxxd2215xxx  binding protein from hamster and rat have been published
(aguilar-bryan, l., nichols, e.g., wechsler, s.w.,
clement iv, j.p., gonzalez, g., herrera-sosa, h.,
nguy, k., bryan, j., and nelson, d.a. (1995) science 268, 423-426). they encode proteins of m r
177 kda which are approx. 98% identical and
possess one potential glycosylation site, 13 transmembrane domains and two nucleotide binding
folds. they apparently belong to the growing
family of atp-binding cassette proteins which
includes the multi drug resistance proteins. transient expression of the cdnas in cosm6 cells
led to the appearance of a 140-kda polypeptide
which could be photolabeled with iodinated
 xxxd2215xxx  as well as of specific binding of
sulfonylureas to isolated membranes. both photolabeling and binding was inhibited in the presence of excess of unlabeled sulfonylureas with the
typical ranking order. these data convincingly
demonstrate that the cloned cdnas encode functional sulfonylurea binding proteins. interestingly,
injection of in vitro transcribed mrna coding for
the binding protein into xenopus oocytes failed
to induce new k ~ currents during patch clamp
analysis. while one cannot exclude that xenopus
oocytes do not represent an adequate background
