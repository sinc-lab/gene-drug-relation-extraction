1 in this study we have evaluated the possible contribution of acetylcholine release in histamine-induced
contractions of guinea-pig large and small intestinal smooth muscle. moreover, the presence of the histamine receptor types involved in smooth muscle relaxations and inhibition of electrically-induced twitches
was studied by use of several selective agents.
2 histamine-induced contractions appeared to be a pure h1-receptor-mediated effect. responses were
not attenuated by the presence of 0.1 ,um atropine and were competitively and stereoselectively inhibited
by the two enantiomers of chlorpheniramine with pa2 values of 6.73 + 0.08, 7.30 + 0.06, 6.93 + 0.03 and
7.19 + 0.04 for the l-isomer and 8.63 + 0.09, 8.85 + 0.09, 9.01 + 0.16 and 8.98 + 0.11 for the d-isomer in
the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, respectively.
3 there appeared to be a marked regional difference in sensitivity to histamine. in ileal and jejunal
preparations pd2 values of 6.24 + 0.06 (n = 22) and 6.37 + 0.07 (n = 22) were found, whereas the pd2
values in the duodenum and colon were 5.55 + 0.05 (n = 36) and 5.68 + 0.06 (n = 31) respectively.
4 this regional difference in sensitivity to histamine was not due to variations in receptor affinity since
pa2 values for the two enantiomers of chlorpheniramine did not differ markedly among the four tested
preparations. since a similar variation in sensitivity was found for  xxxd2586xxx , it is likely that the signal
transfer mechanism in guinea-pig ileum and jejunum is more efficient than in the duodenum and colon.
5 the h2-agonists dimaprit and impromidine relaxed  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted (Â± 70% of maximum
contraction) intestine at high concentrations (pd2 values of 3.79 + 0.03 and 4.44 + 0.09 for the jejunum).
these relaxations could not be antagonized by 0.1 fm tiotidine,  xxxd2082xxx  or mifentidine and were
observed in all parts of the intestine investigated.
6 the dimaprit analogues nordimaprit and homodimaprit (inactive at h2-receptors) were equipotent in
relaxing the  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted smooth muscle. since several h2-antagonists were also able to
produce relaxations, we do not consider these relaxations to be mediated by a h2-receptor subtype, but to
be due to some nonspecific effects at the high concentrations used.
7 the histamine receptor involved in the inhibition of electrically-induced contractions in the presence of
atropine could be classified as an h3-receptor effect. in all parts of the intestine the h3-agonist r-amethylhistamine inhibited the twitches with pd2 values ranging from 8.10 + 0.06 (ileum) to 8.27 + 0.03
(colon). this effect was competitively antagonized with the selective h3-antagonist thioperamine (pa2
values are 8.09 + 0.07, 8.13 + 0.05, 8.15 + 0.04 and 8.36 + 0.04 in duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon,
respectively.
8 the guinea-pig intestine is a suitable preparation for the evaluation of either h1- or h3-receptor
effects. h2-receptors, causing smooth muscle relaxation appear not to be present in our preparations. at
high concentrations of h2-receptor agents (agonists and antagonists) relaxations might be observed, due
to unknown nonspecific effects.

introduction
in their original paper, describing the subclassification of histamine receptors into h1- and h2-receptors, ash & schild
(1966) used the in vitro contraction of guinea-pig isolated
ileum as a test system for h1-receptor activity. although the
intestinal preparation has become a very valuable tool for the
screening of hl-receptor selective drugs, the original notion of
guinea-pig ileum as an h1-receptor preparation (ash &
schild, 1966) has been complicated by the outcome of several
investigations.
it has been suggested that the contractile effects of histamine on guinea-pig ileum are partly dependent on a
tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of acetylcholine (rubenstein &
cohen, 1985). moreover, using selective h2-receptor agents
barker & ebersole (1982) reported the presence of
h2-receptors on guinea-pig myenteric plexus neurones, mediating the release of acetylcholine. to complicate the situation
even more, bertaccini & zappia (1981) described the presence
of an h2-receptor subtype on guinea-pig duodenum, mediating relaxations of precontracted muscle. h2-receptor agonists, like dimaprit, impromidine and clonidine (also an

a2-agonist), caused relaxations with a potency lower than that
usually found for e.g. the positive chronotropic effect on
guinea-pig right atrium (bertaccini & zappia, 1981). the
relaxations could however not be inhibited by the
h2-antagonists  xxxd2622xxx , cimetidine, ranitidine or oxmetidine, nor by tetrodotoxin, propranolol or  xxxd2914xxx 
(bertaccini & zappia, 1981). moreover, fjalland (1979) also
suggested the existence of an h2-receptor subtype in guineapig ileum because histamine was shown to suppress
electrically-induced twitches of ileal smooth muscle, although
the order of potency of h2-antagonists in inhibiting this
action of histamine did not correlate with the known activity
of the compounds at the h2-receptor of guinea-pig right
atrium (fjalland, 1979). recently the classification of histamine receptors has been extended (arrang et al., 1983) and the
presence of an h3-receptor, which is involved in the regulation
of neurotransmitter release in both brain and peripheral
tissues (timmerman, 1990), is currently accepted. since some
h2-antagonists can also act as h3-antagonists (schwartz et al.,
1986) the findings of fjalland (1979) were re-evaluated by
trzeciakowski (1987) and from the latter study it was concluded that the observed inhibition of the electrically-induced

180 r. leurs et al.

twitches was due to an h3-receptor-mediated reduction of
acetylcholine release (trzeciakowski, 1987). previously it has
been reported that histamine could also inhibit electricallyinduced twitches of guinea-pig ileum in the presence of atropine (ambache & zar, 1970; ambache et al., 1970). based
upon the inhibitory action of burimamide ambache et al.
(1973) also suggested the involvement of an h2-receptor
subtype. however, a pharmacological characterization of this
effect in view of the currently accepted histamine receptor subclassification has not been provided.
in the present study we examined several of the problems
outlined above, using highly selective histamine receptor
agonists and antagonists. in both small and large intestine of
the guinea-pig we investigated the possible indirect contractile
effects of histamine (rubenstein & cohen, 1985), the existence
of an h2-receptor subtype, possibly mediating relaxations
(bertaccini & zappia, 1981), and the inhibition of electricallyinduced twitches of the intestinal smooth muscle in the presence of atropine, as originally described by ambache & zar
(1970).

methods

tissue bath studies
male guinea-pigs (350-450g) were killed by a blow on the
head. small and large intestine were immediately excised and
placed in krebs-buffer (composition mm: nacl 117.5, kci 5.6,
 xxxd2534xxx  1.18, cacl2 2.5, nah2po4 1.28, nahco3 25 and
glucose 5.5). the first 12cm of the small intestine was taken as
duodenum and the middle portion was used as jejunum. the
portion of the small intestine that lies 5-15 cm from the ileocaecal valve was considered to be the ileum. the colonic
smooth muscle was taken from the ascending colon. intestinal
smooth muscle strips (10mm long, 2mm wide) were prepared
by cutting the intestine in the longitudinal direction; the
mucosa was not removed. muscle strips were mounted in
20ml krebs buffer, continuously gassed with 95% 02:5%
co2 and maintained at 370c. contractions were recorded isotonically under 0.4 g tension with a hugo sachs hebelmessvorsatz (tl-2)/hf-modem (hugo sachs electronik,
hugstetten, west germany) connected to a pen-recorder.
after equilibration for at least 45min, with replacement of
fresh krebs-buffer every 10min. cumulative dose-response
curves for histamine or  xxxd2586xxx  were recorded using
half-log increments in agonist concentration in the organ bath
until stable responses towards the contractile agent used were
obtained.
to investigate the effect of the smooth muscle relaxants,
smooth muscle strips were contracted to 70-80% of the
maximal  xxxd2586xxx  or histamine response, using single
doses. in some experiments muscle strips were contracted with
40mm kcl. this concentration of kci also yielded 70-80% of
the maximal  xxxd2586xxx  response. the smooth muscle
relaxants were subsequently added cumulatively.
in some experiments the muscle strips were mounted
between two platinum electrodes. rectangular-wave electrical
pulses (grass stimulator s-88, grass instruments co., quincy,
u.s.a.) were delivered to the preparations at a frequency of
50hz and 0.5 ms duration in 10-pulse trains every 33s.
muscle strips were stimulated supramaximally (50 v).
antagonists were usually equilibrated for 5 min after which
contractile or relaxant responses were retested; this period of
time was usually sufficient to reach equilibrium as shown by
schild slope values that did not deviate from unity. for the
antagonists atropine and d-chlorpheniramine, concentrations
of 3, 10, 30 and 100 nm were tested, whereas for lchlorpheniramine, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3pm concentrations were
used. thioperamide was tested at concentrations of 30, 100
and 300 nm. antagonistic activity (pa2) was determined by use
of a schild-plot.

statistics
all data shown are expressed as mean + s.e.mean. ec5o
values were transformed to logarithmic values (pd2 values) for
calculation of a mean value and statistical comparison. tissue
preparations from at least three different animals were used
for each drug treatment. statistical analysis was carried out
with student's t test; p values <0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference.

chemicals
histamine dihydrochloride, procaine hydrochloride, 4aminopyridine, cimetidine and  xxxd247xxx  were purchased from sigma chemical company ltd. (st. louis,
u.s.a.). ranitidine hydrochloride and tetraethylammonium
chloride were obtained from research biochemicals incorporated (natick, u.s.a.). gifts of  xxxd2082xxx  (merck sharp &
dohme), tiotidine (imperial chemical industries), mifentidine
(de angeli), thioperamide, r-a-methylhistamine maleate (dr
j.-c. schwartz, centre paul broca de l'inserm, paris),
impromidine trihydrochloride (smith kline & french), 2amino - 6 - dimethylamino - 4,5,6,7 - tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole
(snd 861 c12, boehringer ingelheim), d- and l-chlorpheniramine (dr a.j. beld, catholic university nijmegen, the
netherlands) and pinacidil (leo pharmaceuticals) are gratefully acknowleged. dimaprit dihydrobromide, nordimaprit
dihydrobromide and homodimaprit dihydrobromide were
taken from laboratory stock (sterk et al., 1984). all other
reagents were of analytical grade.

results
histamine contracts smooth muscle of guinea-pig large and
small intestine in a concentration-dependent way. there
appeared to be a significant difference in sensitivity of the
various intestinal preparations to histamine (table 1). ileal
and jejunal smooth muscle have an approximately equal
sensitivity to histamine, but are almost 5 fold more sensitive
than the duodenal and colonic preparations under the present
conditions (table 1). similar observations were made for the
muscarinic agent  xxxd2586xxx , which was also more potent
in contracting ileal and jejunal smooth muscle than duodenal
and colonic preparations (table 1).
the histamine-induced contractions were competitively
inhibited by the two chlorpheniramine enantiomers. schildslope values did not significantly differ from unity (table 2). in
all tissue preparations the d-isomer of this h,-antagonist
appeared to be the most potent agent (50-80 fold more active
than the l-isomer, table 2). the contractions elicited by  xxxd2586xxx  were competitively antagonized by atropine; schild
slope values did not deviate significantly from unity (table 2).
based on the results of the antagonism of methacholineinduced contractions a concentration of 0.1 m atropine was
chosen for the subsequent experiments, which were undertaken to elucidate a possible indirect contractile mechanism
for histamine. as can be seen in table 1, there was no indication of a contribution of histamine-induced acetylcholine
release to the observed contractions of intestinal smooth
muscle after histamine application. the pd2 values for histamine in the parts of guinea-pig intestine examined were not
influenced by the presence of 0.1 jm atropine under our
experimental conditions (table 1). also the maximal response
to histamine was not attenuated in the presence of atropine
(table 1).
to study the presence of an h2-receptor subtype mediating
relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle, we extended the original study of bertaccini & zappia (1981). as can be seen in
figure 1, dimaprit induced relaxation of methacholineprecontracted duodenal muscle strips. however, the potency
of dimaprit was rather weak. high concentrations of dimaprit
as well as of impromidine were necessary to relax the intesti-

h1-, h2- and h3-receptors in guinea-pig intestine

nal smooth muscle completely (figure 1, table 3, table 4). we
also tried to antagonize this relaxant effect of dimaprit with
the h2-antagonists tiotidine, mifentidine and  xxxd2082xxx . in
concentrations that can be expected to inhibit h2-receptor
responses (0.1 pm) none of these h2-antagonists affected the
dimaprit-induced relaxations of guinea-pig duodenum. to
characterize the receptor subtype involved more clearly, two
dimaprit analogues, devoid of h2-receptor activity, were
examined. both nordimaprit and homodimaprit were able to
relax the  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted duodenum completely
and were equipotent with dimaprit (figure 1). the pd2 values
for the relaxations of the duodenum were 3.34 + 0.12 (n = 9),

3.42 + 0.05 (n = 4) and 3.28 + 0.11 (n = 4) for dimaprit,
homodimaprit and nordimaprit respectively.
these findings were not confined to guinea-pig duodenum.
dimaprit was able to relax  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted
muscle strips of guinea-pig ileum as well as jejunum and colon
with similar potency (table 3). homodimaprit proved to be as
effective as dimaprit in this respect (table 3). guinea-pig colon
was the least sensitive to dimaprit and homodimaprit; contractions were not completely relaxed in this preparation
(table 3). moreover, dimaprit was also able to relax
 xxxd2586xxx -precontracted rat jejunal muscle strips (pd2 =
3.60 + 0.09, n = 2).

another dimaprit analogue, snd 861 c12, which comprises
the complete structure of dimaprit in a cyclic molecule,
behaved as a weak competitive h2-antagonist against the
positive chronotropic actions of histamine on guinea-pig right
atrium (pa2 = 5.49 + 0.16, n = 2, unpublished data from our
laboratory). nevertheless, despite its h2-antagonistic properties this compound was 10 fold more potent than dimaprit in
relaxing  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted jejunal smooth muscle
strips (table 4). several other h2-antagonists were also evaluated for their relaxant activity. cimetidine, tiotidine, mifentidine and  xxxd2082xxx  all appeared to be relaxing agents with a
potency comparable to dimaprit (table 4).
dimaprit not only relaxed  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted
intestinal smooth muscle but also relaxed jejunal strips precontracted with 1yum histamine. the pd2 value for relaxing
these contractions was 3.83 + 0.23 (n = 5). this value was not
significantly different from the pd2 values for the relaxation of
 xxxd2586xxx -precontracted preparations (table 4). yet, if
jejunal muscle strips were precontracted with kci, using a
concentration leading to an approximately similar contraction
to that obtained with 1 m  xxxd2586xxx , most of the histamine receptor agonists and antagonists were not able to relax
the smooth muscle. only at the highest tested concentrations
(usually 3 mm) some small relaxations were sometimes noticed.
also the  xxxg1232xxx  opener, pinacidil, was more
potent in relaxing  xxxd2586xxx -precontracted preparations
(pd2 = 5.12 + 0.12, n = 10) compared with 40 mm kclprecontracted jejunal muscle strips (pd2 = 3.93 + 0.08,
n
11) (figure 2). pinacidil concentration-dependently inhibited the spontaneous activity of the jejunal preparations. in
contrast the  xxxg1232xxx  blockers tetraethylammonium
(tea, 0.3-10mm), procaine (0.3-10mm) and  xxxd1804xxx 
(0.1 mm) concentration-dependently increased the amplitude of
the basal rhythmic activity. spontaneous activity induced by
mm tea was, depending on the preparation, completely
reduced by 5-20pm pinacidil (figure 3). however, none of the
tested compounds affected basal jejunal activity and neither
dimaprit (figure 3) nor tiotidine could inhibit tea-induced
spontaneous activity at a concentration of 1 mm.

h1-, h2- and h3-receptors in guinea-pig intestine

intestine induced an atropine-resistant spasm, which consisted
of several components (figure 4a). stimulation of colonic
muscle strips resulted in a biphasic pattern: first a fast relaxation, which was followed by a rather slowly developing contraction (figure 4b). in the present study we used the highly
selective and potent h3-receptor agonist r-a-methylhistamine
to modulate the observed responses. the h3-agonist was able
to reduce the twitch height of the muscle strips at concentrations of 30nm; maximal effect was usually noticed at a 0.3pm
concentration of r-a-methylhistamine (figures 4 and 5). in
the experiments with the colonic muscle strips only the contractile component of the response was modulated by r-amethylhistamine (figure 4b). the pd2 value for r-a-methylhistamine did not differ markedly among the four preparations tested and was approximately 8.15 in all intestinal
tissues (table 5). the observed contractions could be inhibited
by 60-70% with r-a-methylhistamine (figure 5, table 5).
the inhibitory effects of r-a-methylhistamine were competitively inhibited by the highly selective h3-receptor antagonist
thioperamide (figure 5 inset). the potency of this compound
was similar in all preparations; a pa2 value of approximately
8.2 was found for all tissues (table 5). the schild-slope values
did not deviate from unity in the various preparations (table
5).

discussion
the stimulatory action of histamine on intestinal smooth
muscle has been known since the initial work of dale &
laidlaw (1910, 1911). the development of the classical antihistamines and the observation that the histamine-induced
effects on rat isolated uterus were refractory to inhibition by
these drugs led to the hypothesis that histamine acted via at
least two distinct receptor populations (ash & schild, 1966).
after the discovery of burimamide (black et al., 1972) and
related h2-antagonists, this initial subclassification into h1and h2-receptors was widely accepted.
recently a new histamine receptor subtype has been
described. the histamine h3-receptor has been shown to affect
[3h]-histamine release from preloaded rat brain slices after
potassium-depolarization (arrang et al., 1983) or electrical
stimulation (van der werf et al., 1987). this new receptor
subtype shows remarkably different pharmacological characteristics; highly selective agonists (r-a-methylhistamine) and
antagonists (thioperamide) have already been described
(arrang et al., 1987). due to the development of these selective
h3-receptor agents, investigations on the possible physiological role of the h3-receptor have been conducted. it is now
becoming clear that the h3-receptor forms a general presynaptic regulatory system, which is not restricted to the brain
(timmerman, 1990).
although the guinea-pig ileum was the first tissue used as
an hl-receptor preparation (ash & schild, 1966), there are
now several reports indicating that histamine can act via
several histamine receptor subtypes in the intestinal preparation. histamine contracts both ileal longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layer via activation of h l-receptors
(barker, 1985; yamanaka & kitamura, 1987), but can probably also relax circular muscle via an h2-receptor-induced

hyperpolarization of the membrane (yamanaka & kitamura,
1987). besides, h2-receptor agonists have been reported to be
both contractile and relaxant agents of guinea-pig intestinal
longitudinal smooth muscle (bertaccini & zappia, 1981;
barker & ebersole, 1985). dimaprit has been reported to
release acetylcholine from guinea-pig ileum myenteric plexus
neurones in a tiotidine-sensitive manner (barker & ebersole,
1985), whereas acetylcholine release is also reported to contribute to the histamine-mediated contraction of the longitudinal smooth muscle (rubenstein & cohen, 1985).
in the present study such a contribution of acetylcholine
could not be found in any of the intestinal preparations tested.
histamine proved to be a potent contractile agent, but the
pd, value for histamine was not affected by the presence of
0.1 fm atropine. based upon the measured pa2 values for atropine against  xxxd2586xxx -induced responses (8.44-8.85), it
can be concluded that in our preparations, 0.1 gm atropine is a
suitable concentration for the study to a contribution of
acetylcholine release to the histamine-mediated contractions.
such a contribution is therefore rather unlikely.
finally, the histamine-induced contractions were competitively and stereoselectively antagonized by the two stereoisomers of the hl-receptor antagonist chlorpheniramine. the
pa2 values for the two stereoisomers correspond well with
their reported affinity for the h1-receptor (hill & young,
1980) and do not differ markedly among the different intestinal preparations. these data suggest that the histamineinduced contraction is only due to the activation of
h1-receptors. based upon the pa2 values of the
h1-antagonists, there appeared to be no marked regional
variation in h1-receptor affinity. previously similar findings
have been reported by barker (1985) for guinea-pig ileum and
colon. in contrast to the pa2 values for the h1-receptor, a
remarkable regional variation in sensitivity to histamine was
noticed among the four preparations tested. this difference
might be due to differences in h1-receptor density or the
stimulus transfer mechanism. since  xxxd2586xxx -induced
responses show a similar variation in sensitivity we assume
that in contrast to the duodenum and colon, the guinea-pig
ileum and jejunum possess an efficient stimulus transfer
mechanism leading to a receptor reserve.
as already mentioned, it has been reported that
h2-receptor agonists can relax duodenal longitudinal smooth
muscle (bertaccini & zappia, 1981). according to these
authors, the relaxations could not be antagonized by a
number of h2-antagonists such as cimetidine,  xxxd2622xxx , ranitidine and oxmetidine and it was therefore suggested that they
were mediated by an h2-receptor subtype (bertaccini &
zappia, 1981). in the present study these relaxations were
observed in guinea-pig ileum, jejunum, colon and rat jejunum
and several agents acting on histamine receptors were used for
a more detailed pharmacological characterization. the recently developed h2-receptor antagonists  xxxd2082xxx , mifentidine
and tiotidine were all unable to antagonize the dimapritinduced relaxations. besides dimaprit, impromidine also
relaxed the precontracted intestinal muscle at relatively high
concentrations. the length of the alkyl chain in dimaprit is
rather essential for h2-receptor agonistic activity as both nordimaprit and homodimaprit possess hardly any h2-receptor
activity (ganellin, 1982). yet, these two compounds are
approximately equipotent with dimaprit in relaxing the
guinea-pig duodenum. moreover, snd 861 c12, which comprises the structure of dimaprit in a cyclic molecule, is the
most potent relaxant agent observed in this study. nevertheless, this compound is devoid of any h2-agonistic activity and
behaves even as a weak competitive h2-receptor antagonist
against histamine-induced positive chronotropic effects in
guinea-pig right atrium (pa2 = 5.49). moreover, other
h2-receptor antagonists also proved to be able to relax intestinal smooth muscle at high concentrations. based on these
results, the presence of an h2-receptor subtype, involved in
smooth muscle relaxation, seems rather unlikely. despite their
activity at the h2-receptor (agonist, antagonist or inactive) all

tested compounds were able to produce relaxations of visceral
smooth muscle. since a2-adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine and
 xxxd3393xxx ) are also relaxant agents in this preparation
(bertaccini & zappia, 1981) the observed effects are probably
related to a nonspecific effect at the high concentrations used.
in this study it was observed that muscle strips, when precontracted with kcl, were rather resistant to relaxation by
agents acting on histamine receptors. this might indicate that
the observed relaxations are due to an action at the potassium
channels in the plasma membrane. it has been shown that
some recently developed smooth muscle relaxants act via the
opening of potassium channels (weir & weston, 1986). these
drugs have been reported to be able to relax vascular pulmonary and also intestinal smooth muscle (matsui et al.,
1986; weir & weston, 1986; buchheit & bertholet, 1988;
mellemkjaer et al., 1989). the  xxxg1232xxx  opener,
pinacidil, bears some structural similarity to some h2-receptor
antagonists and indeed proved to be more effective in relaxing
 xxxd2586xxx -precontracted muscle strips than kciprecontracted preparations. however, pinacidil also
concentration-dependently inhibited jejunal spontaneous
motility. this activity is not shared by any of the agents acting
on histamine receptors. the inhibition of basal motor activity
can probably be related to interference with the potassium
channels, since similar findings have been published for
another  xxxg1232xxx  opener, cromakalim (buchheit &
bertholet, 1988). moreover, in the present study, several  xxxg1232xxx  blockers (tetraethylammonium, 4aminopyridine, procaine) proved to enhance the intestinal
motility. this effect could be inhibited by pinacidil, but was
not affected by dimaprit or tiotidine. these data indicate that
intereference at the level of potassium channels cannot explain
the relaxant effects of the agents acting on histamine receptors. the mechanism of action involved therefore remains to
be elucidated.
finally we studied the involvement of the h3-receptor in
the inhibitory response of histamine on electrically stimulated
intestinal smooth muscle strips (fjalland, 1979; ambache &
zar, 1970; ambache et al., 1970; 1973). based on the inhibitory effects of burimamide, this effect was suggested to be
mediated by an h2-receptor subtype (ambache et al., 1973;
fjalland, 1979). recently trzeciakowski (1987) showed that
under conditions of electrical stimulation, that release acetylcholine, the histamine-induced inhibition could be denoted as
an h3-receptor effect. however, the myenteric plexus contains
a rather heterogenous neuronal population, which might
release various substances (sternini, 1988). besides acetylcholine, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, several neuropeptides and excitatory aminoacids are probably also
involved in the regulation and modulation of intestinal motility (sternini, 1988; nemeth & gullikson, 1989; shannon &
sawyer, 1989). indeed, ambache & freeman (1968) observed
that tetanic stimulation of guinea-pig ileum produced a contraction due to the release of a non-cholinergic substance(s)
from the myenteric plexus. the nature of the contractile
substance(s) is not clear yet, but is now under investigation in
our laboratory. the contractions after tetanic stimulation (in
the presence of o.1 um atropine) were reduced by histamine
(ambache et al., 1970; ambache & zar, 1970) via a suggested
h2-receptor subtype (ambache et al., 1973). by use of the
highly selective h3-receptor agonist r-a-methylhistamine,
twitch responses in the presence of 0.1 um atropine could be
inhibited in all intestinal preparations. these effects are effectively and competitively antagonized by thioperamide, a
highly selective h3-receptor antagonist. the pa2 values for
this compound correlate well with previous findings (arrang
et al., 1987) and do not differ among the preparations tested,
indicating a homogeneous population of h3-receptors in the
intestinal tract. these receptors appear to modulate the
release of acetylcholine (trzeciakowski, 1987), but can also
inhibit the release of other non-cholinergic contractile substances. the h3-receptor appears therefore to be a rather
general regulatory mechanism in the intestine.

hl-,
in conclusion, our study indicates that the guinea-pig intestine contracts in response to histamine via a pure
hl-receptor-activated mechanism. in the preparations we
used, no contribution of acetylcholine release was observed.
at high concentrations of certain histamine agonists and
antagonists relaxation of the smooth muscle unrelated to
h2-receptor stimulation occurs via a yet unidentified nonspe-

h2- and h3-receptors in guinea-pig intestine

cific action. moreover, in all parts of the intestine
h3-receptors appear to be present. besides acetylcholine,
release of unidentified, non-cholinergic substances are also
inhibited via h3-receptor stimulation. the intestinal smooth
muscle might therefore be a suitable preparation for the evaluation of either h,-receptor or h3-receptor effects.
