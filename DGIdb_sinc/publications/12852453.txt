determination of simvastatin-derived  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors in biomatrices using an automated enzyme inhibition assay with radioactivity dete...  a robust, automated enzyme inhibition assay method was developed and validated for the determination of  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitory activities in plasma and urine samples following simvastatin (sv) administration. the assay was performed on tecan genesis 150 and 200 systems equipped with 8-probe and 96-well plates. plasma samples containing  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors were treated with acetonitrile for protein precipitation before being incubated with  xxxg1060xxx , [14c]-hmg-coa, and nadph for a fixed length of time at a fixed temperature. the product, [14c]-mevalonic acid, was lactonized and separated from excess substrate via a small ion exchange resin column, and radioactivity was counted on a scintillation counter.  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitors were measured before and after base hydrolysis. the two values obtained for each sample are referred to as 'active' and 'total'  xxxg1060xxx  inhibitor concentrations. simvastatin acid (sva), the beta-hydroxy acid of sv, was used as a standard to generate a calibration curve of  xxxg1060xxx  activity versus sva concentration (ng/ml). three calibration ranges, 0.4-20, 2-50, and 50, 100 ng/ml, in human and animal plasma and urine were validated. the assay precision was less than 8.5%, cv in plasma and less than 10.4% in urine. the assay accuracy was 93.6-103.0 and 98.1-103.9% for the 0.4 20 and 2-50 ng/ml calibration ranges, respectively, in human plasma, and was 97.3-105.1, 94.4- 105.2, and 90.2-95.7%, for calibration range 5-100 ng/ml in rat plasma, dog plasma and human urine, respectively.
