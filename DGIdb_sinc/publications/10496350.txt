summary mechanisms of resistance to  xxxd3077xxx  include increased  xxxg2366xxx  activity, as well as reduced intracellular drug
uptake and polyglutamation. however, little is known about other mechanisms of resistance, such as a possible protection against tomudexinduced apoptosis mediated by bcl-2. we transfected the mda-mb-435 human breast cancer cell line, which is characterized by a mutated
p53 gene, with cdna of the bcl-2 gene and generated two clones (mda-bcl4 and mda-bcl7) characterized by bcl-2 expression twofold and
fourfold that observed in the control cell clone (mdaneo). a concomitant overexpression of p21wafl was also detected in the mda-bcl7 clone.
the mda-bcl4 clone was three times more resistant to a 24-h  xxxd3077xxx  exposure than the mdaneo clone, whereas the mda-bcl7 clone was
as sensitive to  xxxd3077xxx  as the control cell clone. a lower sensitivity of the mda-bcl4 clone than mdaneo and mda-bcl7 clones to 5-fluorouracil
and gemcitabine was also observed. no significant difference was noted in the susceptibility of clones to  xxxd2120xxx  and methothrexate.
basal levels of  xxxg2366xxx  activity were superimposable in the three clones.  xxxd3077xxx  induced a marked accumulation of cells in
the s phase in all the clones. however, an apoptotic hypodiploid dna peak and the characteristic nuclear morphology of apoptosis were
observed only in the mda-bcl7 clone after exposure to  xxxd3077xxx . no difference in the treatment-induced modulation of proteins involved in
cell cycle progression ( xxxg365xxx ,  xxxg410xxx , prb,  xxxg668xxx ) and apoptosis (bcl-2, bax) was observed in the three clones. the only exception was that
the expression of p21wafl in the mda-bcl4 clone was inducible at a  xxxd3077xxx  concentration much higher than that required to induce the protein
in the other clones. overall, the results indicate that bcl-2 and p21wafl proteins concur in determining the cellular profile of sensitivity/resistance
to  xxxd3077xxx .

 xxxd3077xxx  (tdx), a quinazoline folate analogue, is a pure inhibitor
of  xxxg2366xxx  (ts), the enzyme which catalyses the
methylation of  xxxd1838xxx , using 5,10methylene-tetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor, to  xxxd3364xxx 
monophosphate, an essential precursor of dna synthesis
(jackman et al, 1991a; jackman and calvert, 1995; rustum et al,
1997). tdx structurally resembles the physiological folates and
requires an active transmembrane transport system. specifically,
the drug can be internalized via both the reduced folate carrier
(which also transports methotrexate) and the membrane-associated
 xxxg807xxx  (westerhof et al, 1995; pinard et al, 1996).
the drug is metabolized to polyglutamate forms, which are more
potent as inhibitors of ts and are more slowly effluxed from cells
than the unmetabolized monoglutamate compound (jackman et al,
1993). panadero et al (1995) showed that tdx induced extensive
fragmentation of genomic dna and newly synthesized dna in
hct-8 ileocaecal adenocarcinoma cells and that the effect was
correlated with an increase in the deoxyuridine triphosphate pool
and a concomitant decrease in the  xxxd3364xxx  triphosphate
pool.
tdx has shown activity in a variety of cell lines of different
human tumour histotypes (jackman et al, 1995a; kelland et al,

1995) and in animal tumour models (jackman et al, 1991b). the
drug has also demonstrated clinical benefits in terms of higher
response rates and lower toxicity than obtained with 5-fluorouracil
(5-fu) plus  xxxd2462xxx  in patients with advanced colorectal cancer
(cunningham et al, 1995). it is now currently used in the clinical
treatment of such tumour type, alone or in combination with other
agents including 5-fu (infusion and bolus),  xxxd2923xxx 
and topoisomerase inhibitors (van cutsem, 1997; blackledge,
1998). moreover, tdx has demonstrated encouraging activity
against ovarian, non-small-cell lung, pancreatic and breast cancer
(smith et al, 1996; judson, 1997).
since the major limitation to the successful use of chemotherapeutic agents is the development of clinical resistance, it is important to identify the potential mechanisms of resistance to tdx in
tumour cells. several biochemical determinants of resistance to
tdx have been investigated, including decreased drug uptake by
the reduced folate/methotrexate carrier, impaired intracellular
polyglutamation and increased ts levels (freemantle et al, 1995;
jackman et al, 1995b; lu et al, 1995; drake et al, 1996).
conversely, little is known about other potential mechanisms of
resistance to tdx, such as a possible protection against tdxinduced apoptosis mediated by bcl-2. to address this issue, we
transfected the p53 mutant mda-mb-435 breast cancer cell line
with cdna of the bcl-2 gene and assessed the sensitivity profile to
tdx in two selected clones with different expression of bcl-2
and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21wafl proteins. a
different sensitivity to tdx, in terms of cell survival and susceptibility to undergo apoptosis, was observed in the different clones.

bcl-2 and p21wafl as determinants of  xxxd3077xxx  sensitivity 253

in order to elucidate such differences, we analysed the effects of
tdx on proteins involved in the control of cell cycle progression
(mainly g1 to s phase) and apoptosis. in parallel, sensitivity of
cell clones to other antimetabolites or drugs with different action
mechanisms was also assessed.

cell lines and transfection procedures
the mda-mb-435 human breast cancer cell line used in the study
is characterized by a mutated p53 gene (266gga→gaa)
(o’connor et al, 1997). the bcl-2 gene under the control of the
ssfv promoter inserted into the native ltr-sv neo vector
(kindly provided by dr sj korsmeyer, washington university, st
louis, mo, usa) was introduced into mda-mb-435 cells using
lipofectamine (gibco-brl, gaithersburg, md, usa) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. mda-mb-435 cells (4 × 105) were
plated in 100-mm dishes; the next day they were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and overlaid with serum-free
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) ham’s f-12
(gibco) containing 10 µg linearized bcl-2 expression or control
vector dna and 20 µl lipofectamine. after 16 h, medium was
replaced with dmem/ham’s f-12 containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs; gibco) for 5 h, followed by incubation in
dmem/ham’s f-12 containing 5% fbs for 24 h. stable
transfectants were selected in the presence of 900 µg ml–1  xxxg418xxx 
(geneticine, gibco). after 15–18 days, 40 resistant colonies
containing bcl-2-expressing vector or the vector alone were
harvested and tested for bcl-2 expression by western blot analysis.
overall, three clones were selected: mdaneo (control vector),
mda-bcl4 and mda-bcl7 (bcl-2 transfectants).
chemicals
doxorubicin (pharmacia-upjohn, uppsala, sweden) was
dissolved in normal saline solution. taxol (sigma chemical co.,
st louis, mo, usa) was stored as a 200 µmol µl–1 stock solution
in dimethyl sulphoxide and then reconstituted and diluted in sterile
water to obtain a solvent concentration of less than 0.25%.
 xxxd2120xxx  (9-beta-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine-5′ monophosphate, fludara, kindly supplied by shering, berlin, germany)
was reconstituted in pbs. gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine, kindly supplied by eli lilly, indianapolis, in, usa) was
reconstituted in sterile water. 5-fu ( xxxd2134xxx , roche, basel,
switzerland) and methotrexate (lederle, cyanamid, aprilia (lt),
italy) were diluted in sterile water. tdx ( xxxd3077xxx , [n-(5-[n-(3,4dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-n-methylamino]2-thenoyl)- xxxd2431xxx ], kindly supplied by zeneca,
pharmaceuticals, macclesfield, uk), was dissolved in 0.1 m
sodium bicarbonate, ph 8.3, at a concentration of 200 µg ml–1 and
diluted in dmem/ham’s f-12 medium.
cell proliferation studies
the mda-mb-435 parental cell line, the mdaneo clone (transfected with ltr-sv neo vector alone) and bcl-2 transfectants
(mda-bcl4 and mda-bcl7) were cultured in dmem/ham’s f-12
medium lacking  xxxg418xxx , supplemented with 5% fbs. after
harvesting in the logarithmic growth phase, cells were seeded in

6-well plates and treated with varying doses of taxol,  xxxd2120xxx ,
gemcitabine, 5-fu, methotrexate and tdx for 24 h, or doxorubicin
for 1 h. exposure times to different drugs were chosen according to
the treatment times used in previous studies (silvestrini et al, 1993).
at the end of treatment, adherent cells were washed with pbs and
incubated at 37°c in a 5% carbon dioxide humidified atmosphere
for 3 days. cells were then trypsinized and counted in a particle
counter (coulter counter, coulter electronics, luton, uk). the
percentages of adherent viable cells were determined by the trypan
blue dye exclusion test. viability always exceeded 95%. each
experimental sample was run in triplicate. the results were
expressed as the total number of adherent cells in treated samples
compared with control samples. in vitro activities of different drugs
were expressed in terms of concentrations able to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% (ic50).
ts catalytic activity assay
the assay proposed by van der wilt et al (1992) was used with
some modifications. briefly, 10 × 106 cells were suspended in
0.8 ml of ice-cold assay buffer containing 200 mm tris–hcl,
20 mm  xxxd26xxx , 100 mm naf and 15 mm cytidine-5′monophosphate (ph 7.4). cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm. the supernatants containing the enzyme
(enzyme suspensions) were split into two parts for protein content
determination and ts catalytic activity assay. the ts catalytic
activity assay was carried out with 10 µl of enzyme suspensions
(in different dilutions), 5 µl n5,n10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
and 10 µl of [5-3h]-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate (10-µm
final concentration). reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min
at 37°c and stopped by addition of 50 µl ice-cold 35% trichloroacetic acid and 250 µl 10% neutral activated charcoal. after
centrifugation, radioactivity present in 150 µl of supernatant was
determined by liquid scintillation counting. ts activity was
expressed as 3h release (pmol h–1 10–6 cells) produced during the
conversion of [3h] xxxd1838xxx  to 3h2o.
flow cytometric analysis
immediately after a 24-h tdx exposure, or after an additional 8
and 24 h in drug-free medium, samples of 1 × 106 cells were fixed
in 70% ethanol. before analysis, cells were washed in pbs and
stained with a solution containing 50 µg ml–1  xxxd3027xxx  iodide,
50 mg ml–1 rnaase, and 0.05% np40 for 30 min at 4°c and then
analysed with a facscan flow cytometer (becton dickinson,
sunnyvale, ca, usa). an aliquot of each sample was also
analysed under fluorescence microscopy for evaluation of nuclear
morphology. the cell cycle distribution was evaluated on dna
plots by cellfit software according to the sobr model (becton
dickinson).
immunohistochemistry
after trypsinization of exponentially growing clones, samples of
cell suspensions were seeded onto glass slides, air-dried and immediately fixed in formalin for 3 min. fixed cells were rehydrated
with pbs and labelled with the monoclonal antibody anti-p21wafl
(clone dcs 60.2; neomarkers, freemont, ca, usa). antibody
binding to cells was evidenced by the biotin–streptavidin alkaline
phosphatase technique.

cell lysis and immunoblotting
cells were lysed in 1% nonidet p-40, prepared in pbs containing
10 µg ml–1 leupeptin, 10 µg ml–1 aprotinin, 1 mm  xxxd502xxx , 1 mm
na3vo4, 1mm nappo4 and 10 mm naf. cell lysates were clarified
(15 min, 15 000 rpm), and the resultant supernatants were used for
protein analysis. total cellular lysate (100 µg) was dissolved in 2 ×
sample loading buffer (2%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 5% 2mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 60 mm m tris, ph 6.8, and
0.0025% bromophenol), separated on 12% sds-polyacrylamide
gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. filters were blocked in pbs
with 5% skim milk and then incubated overnight with the primary
monoclonal antibody anti-prb (retinoblastoma protein), anti-bax,
anti-bcl-2, anti  xxxg668xxx , anti- xxxg365xxx  and anti- xxxg410xxx  (santa cruz
biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa), anti-p21wafl (oncogene
science, cambridge, ma, usa) or anti-ts (kindly supplied by dr
pg johnston, queen’s university, belfast, ireland). filters were
then incubated with the secondary antibody antimouse or
antirabbit ig horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody
(amersham, buckinghamshire, uk). bound antibody was
detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting
detection system (amersham). an anti-pcna (proliferating cell
nuclear antigen) monoclonal antibody (santa cruz biotechnology)
was used on each blot to ensure equal loading of protein on the gel.

and mda-bcl7, tdx was used at a concentration of 8 µm, which
is the ic50 of the two clones. for mda-bcl4, besides the 8 µm
concentration, the specific ic50 of the clone (25 µm) was also used.
immediately after a 24-h treatment with 8 µm of tdx, a very
slight accumulation of cells in the s phase was observed in all
three clones. such accumulations became more evident 48 h after
beginning the tdx treatment, when most of the cells were
arrested in the s phase. the extent of the accumulation was superimposable in the clones independently of the different cytotoxic
effects induced by the drug. moreover, a marked decrease in the
g2/m cell fraction, consistent with an inhibition of dttp synthesis
induced by tdx, was observed in mdaneo and mda-bcl4 clones.
in the mda-bcl4 clone, exposure to 25 µm of tdx induced a
slight accumulation of cells in the g0/1 phase 24 h and 32 h after
beginning the tdx treatment, followed by a marked accumulation
of cells in the s phase, to an extent similar to that observed with
the 8-µm tdx treatment.
to investigate at a molecular level possible differences in the
events that regulate progression through the s phase, we analysed
the effects of 8 µm tdx treatment on prb,  xxxg668xxx ,  xxxg365xxx  and
 xxxg410xxx  protein expression. an increase in  xxxg668xxx ,  xxxg365xxx  and  xxxg410xxx 
levels was observed in all cell clones, whereas no treatmentinduced modulation of prb expression and phosphorylation was
observed (figure 3).

the parental mda-mb-435 cell line and the control transfectant
mdaneo clone showed very low and similar levels of bcl-2 expression, whereas mda-bcl4 and mda-bcl7 clones were characterized by bcl-2 expression twofold and fourfold (as evaluated by
densitometric analysis of immunoblotting) that observed in
mdaneo and mda-mb-435 cells (figure 1). no difference was
observed in any of the three clones and the parental cell line as
regards the expression of p53 and bax proteins. conversely, an
overexpression of p21wafl protein was observed in mda-bcl7
(figure 1). specially, the level of p21wafl in the mda-bcl7 clone
was twofold that observed in mdaneo cells. p21wafl results obtained
by western blotting were also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (figure 2). analysis of the logarithmic growth rate of bcl-2transfected clones and of the clone transfected with the control
vector indicated a doubling time of approximately 20 h for all the
cell lines (table 1). moreover, similar basal catalytic activities of
ts were observed in mdaneo, mda-bcl4 and mda-bcl7.
as regards sensitivity to different anticancer agents (table 2),
the three clones showed similar susceptibility to the antimetabolite
 xxxd2120xxx  and drugs with other mechanisms of action such as
doxorubicin and taxol, as indicated by the superimposable ic50
values. the mda-bcl4 clone was slightly, although not significantly, less sensitive than mdaneo and mda-bcl7 clones to
methotrexate. moreover, the mda-bcl4 clone was significantly
more resistant to 5-fu, gemcitabine (p < 0.025) and tdx
(p < 0.01) than the other two clones.

mda-bcl7

flow cytometric analysis of the three clones exposed to 8 µm tdx
showed that 48 h after beginning the treatment, approximately
14% of mda-bcl7 cells exhibited a hypodiploid dna content.
such a pre-g1 apoptotic cell peak was not observed in mda-bcl4
or in cells transfected with the control vector (figure 4). in addition, evaluation by fluorescence microscopy of cell clones stained
with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide confirmed the presence of cells with the
characteristic nuclear morphology of apoptosis only in the

mda-bcl7 clone (figure 5). in order to elucidate the pathway of
tdx-induced programmed cell death, the effect of treatment on
proteins involved in the onset of apoptosis was assessed. as shown
in figure 6, no appreciable modulation of bax or bcl-2 protein
expression, or in the bcl-2 phosphorylation status, was observed in
any of the three clones. conversely, an induction of p21wafl expression was found after exposure to 8 µm tdx in mdaneo and mdabcl7 but not in the mda-bcl4 clone. such an increase was
maximal at 48 h after beginning the tdx treatment. in the mdabcl4 clone, a marked induction of the p21wafl protein became
apparent when cells were treated with the highest (25 µm) tdx
concentration (figure 7).
effect of tdx on ts expression
finally, to verify whether or not tdx differentially affected the
expression of its target enzyme, thus influencing cellular sensitivity

to the drug, we analysed the expression in ts protein after treatment with 8 µm tdx. as shown in figure 8, an increase of ts
expression was appreciable in all cell clones to a similar extent.

tdx is a specific inhibitor of ts and has demonstrated its activity
in many solid tumours in experimental systems. moreover, among
novel ts inhibitors, tdx is furthest along in its clinical development (van cutsem, 1997). due to increasing clinical interest in the
drug, it is important to identify possible mechanisms of inherent or
acquired resistance, other than the well-known classical biochemical mechanisms of resistance to antimetabolites (kinsella et al,
1997).
the present study investigated the role of bcl-2 and p21wafl
proteins in the response of human breast cancer cell clones to tdx.

with cdna of the bcl-2 gene. two clones (mda-bcl4 and mdabcl7), both characterized by bcl-2 expression respectively twofold
and fourfold that observed in the control cell clone tranfected with
c-dna of the neomycin-resistance gene alone (mdaneo), were
generated. the three clones were similar in growth profile, basal
ts activity and expression, and expression of p53 and bax, whereas
in the mda-bcl7 clone an induction of p21wafl concomitant to bcl-2
overexpression was observed.
analysis of the chemosensitivity profiles of the three cell clones
showed a similar sensitivity towards the antimetabolite  xxxd2120xxx .
however, the mda-bcl4 clone was more resistant than mdaneo and
mda-bcl7 clones to other antimetabolites such as gemcitabine,
5-fu and methotrexate, and particularly resistant (threefold) to
tdx. overall, it emerged that transfection of cells with bcl-2
reduced sensitivity to tdx and that such resistance was not evident
in cells that concomitantly overexpressed p21wafl. such results are in
agreement with the work of fisher et al (1993), who reported that
burkitt’s lymphoma cells transfected with bcl-2 showed an
increased cell viability and a concomitant reduction of apoptosis,
compared to control cells, after treatment with the antimetabolite
 xxxd2117xxx  and quinazoline-based ts inhibitors such as
 xxxd1260xxx  and ici m247496. similarly to our results, the authors also
showed that cell cycle and ts level and activity were not altered by
transfection of lymphoma cells with bcl-2.
the results of cross-resistance studies support the possibility
that in the mda-bcl4 clone there is a polyglutamation defect or a
reduced uptake of the drug, since methotrexate, which shares the
same carrier with tdx and also undergoes polyglutamation,
showed a reduced activity in the clone. however, such a hypoth-

esis does not completely explain the higher resistance to tdx than
to methotrexate observed in the clone. moreover, we can exclude
that the partial cross-resistance of tdx and 5-fu in the mdabcl4 clone is due to ts alterations, since in the clone the basal
activity of ts was similar to that of mdaneo and mda-bcl7.
a finding that deserves further investigation is that tdx resistance was completely overcome in the mda-bcl7 clone overexpressing concomitantly bcl-2 and p21wafl. p21wafl, which was
originally identified as an inhibitor of  xxxg410xxx ,  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg407xxx  kinase
complexes (xiong et al, 1993), is a transcriptional target of p53
and is strongly induced by dna damage in cells expressing functional p53 (el-deiry et al, 1994). however, its activation can also
occur independently of p53 (russo et al, 1993; sheikh, 1994). in
the presence of functional prb, p21wafl inhibits the activity of
cyclin d– xxxg411xxx ,  xxxg365xxx – xxxg410xxx  and cyclin e– xxxg410xxx  complexes,
thereby increasing the level of hypophosphorylated prb, which in
turn associates with  xxxg668xxx  and arrests the cells in g1 phase
(chellappan et al, 1991; ikeda et al, 1996). moreover, p21wafl is
involved in tumour growth suppression and cellular response to
dna damage (chen et al, 1995; garthenhaus et al, 1995). we
therefore investigated whether differences in tdx sensitivity
could be supported by differences in cell cycle perturbations

induced by tdx treatment. the ts inhibitor caused a marked
accumulation of cells in the s phase, which was superimposible in
all three clones. moreover, in the mda-bcl4 clone, tdx resistance could not be ascribed to a different interference of the drug
on the cell cycle, since comparable s phase cell accumulations
were observed after treatment with two drug concentrations (8 and
25 µm), which induced different cytotoxic effects.
at a molecular level, tdx induced increases in  xxxg668xxx ,  xxxg365xxx 
and  xxxg410xxx  levels as cells progressed and accumulated in the s
phase, whereas prb expression and phosphorylation did not show
any change as a function of tdx treatment. although a direct
comparison between the data obtained in the different clones by
using a non-equitoxic tdx concentration cannot be made, the
superimposable patterns of protein modulation observed suggest
that the levels of such proteins are not responsible for the different
sensitivity to tdx but that they merely reflect a drug-induced cell
cycle perturbation which is consistent in the three clones. a timedependent increase in ts protein was similarly observed in all the
three clones after tdx exposure. ts overexpression could be due
to the transactivation by  xxxg668xxx  of the ts gene, which is required
for entry of cells in the s phase (sherr, 1996), or, alternatively, to a
cellular effort to overcome the cytotoxic stress induced by tdx by
increasing the production of its target enzyme.
since bcl-2 (kroemer, 1997) and p21wafl (el-deiry, 1994) are
involved in the apoptotic process, a possibility is that a different

induction and regulation of apoptosis could be responsible for
tdx resistance in the mda-bcl4 clone and for restoring tdx
sensitivity in the mda-bcl7 clone. flow cytometric analysis
evidenced a pre-g1 apoptotic cell peak only in the mda-bcl7
clone 48 h after beginning tdx treatment, and morphologic
analysis confirmed the presence of apoptotic cells only in this
clone. however, since the analysis was performed only at a
constant tdx concentration, which produced different cytotoxic
effects in the two cell clones, on the basis of our data it is not
possible to establish that a lower susceptibility to undergo apoptosis was responsible for resistance to tdx in the mda-bcl4
clone.
as regards the effect of tdx on the expression of proteins
involved in the onset of apoptosis, no change was observed in  xxxg250xxx  and bax compared to basal levels of control, whereas an induction of p21wafl was observed in the two clones with similar
sensitivity to tdx, mdaneo and mda-bcl7, but not in the mdabcl4-resistant clone. in fact, in the latter clone, a higher tdx
concentration was necessary to produce an appreciable induction
of p21wafl. we could hypothesize that enhanced basal expression
and inducibility of p21wafl was able to overcome the anti-apoptotic
effect of bcl-2 and to restore the sensitivity to tdx in mda-bcl7.
our results are in agreement with the findings of li et al (1997),
who showed that in saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, lacking p53 and
prb, overexpression of p21wafl increased sensitivity to tdx,
methotrexate and doxorubicin by increasing the extent of apoptosis. the overexpression of p21wafl reduced  xxxg365xxx -associated
kinase activity and resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of
 xxxg668xxx  and increased  xxxg668xxx  binding activity. such events lead to
an enhanced s–g2 cell cycle delay and increased susceptibility to
apoptosis. since in our experimental models no effect of p21wafl
overexpression on the duration of the s phase block was observed,
we hypothesize that the pathway described by li et al (1997) could
be different from that followed by our clones.
overall, our results suggest that bcl-2 and p21wafl proteins
concur in determining the profile of sensitivity/resistance of
mda-mb-435 breast cancer cells to tdx. the reacquisition of
tdx sensitivity in the mda-bcl7 clone could be mediated, at least

in part, by overexpression of p21wafl and susceptibility of cells to
undergo apoptosis. several studies have shown that overexpression of p21wafl alone can induce apoptosis following transfection
(sheikh et al, 1995; prabhu et al, 1996). however, the role of
p21wafl in the apoptosis process is still controversial. studies are
warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
bcl-2 and p21wafl are involved in tdx cytotoxic activity and
apoptosis.
