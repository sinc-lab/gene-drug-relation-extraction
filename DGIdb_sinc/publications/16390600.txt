introduction
oral mucositis is a direct result of cytotoxic chemotherapy on the rapidly dividing cells of the oral
epithelium, resulting in atrophy, erythema and ulceration.1 while oral mucositis can occur with almost any
type of chemotherapy, it is universal and typically
severe in individuals receiving high dose chemotherapy requiring stem cell support. in two retroaddress correspondence and reprint requests to jill kolesar,

a treatment option for patients who are at high risk
for oral mucositis, specifically patients with
hematological malignancies receiving stem cell
transplantation (sct). in a phase iii study of these
patients, the overall incidence of world health
organization (who) grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis
was significantly reduced in the  xxxd2829xxx  group
( xxxd2829xxx 63% versus placebo98%, p b0.001).
among the patients who experienced who
grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis the average duration
of this grade of mucositis in the  xxxd2829xxx  group
was six days compared with nine days in the
placebo group (p b0.001). common adverse
effects of  xxxd2829xxx  include pruritis, erythema,
mouth and tongue disorders, and taste alterations. j oncol pharm practice (2005) 11:

eat, talk or sleep. in addition, oral mucositis with
ulceration may result in an increased risk of infection,
increased hospitalizations, and increased risk of
treatment failure and rarely, death. using the oral
mucositis assessment scale (omas), a validated tool
for assessing mucositis, sonis et al. 6 found that a one
point increase in score on the scale was significantly
correlated with an additional day of fever (p b0.01),
a 2.1-fold increase in infection (p b0.01), an additional 2.7 days of  xxxd3210xxx  (tpn)
(p b0.0001), an additional 2.6 days of injectable
narcotic therapy (p b0.0001), an additional 2.6 days
in the hospital (p b0.01), an additional us$25405 in
hospital charges (p b0.0001) and a 3.9-fold increase
in 100-day mortality (p b0.01). using the university
of nebraska oral assessment score (mucpeak), a
different validated tool for assessing mucositis, rapoport et al. 7 found that severe oral mucositis (defined
as a mucpeak score of 18 or higher) was correlated
with positive blood cultures (severe mucositis 60%
versus lack of severe mucositis 30%, p0.001) and
transplant-related mortality (severe mucositis24%
versus. lack of severe mucositis4%, p0.001).
until recently, there was no standard approach for
the prevention of oral mucositis following high-dose
chemotherapy with or without tbi in patients undergoing sct. low-level laser therapy (lllt) (level of
evidence, ii; grade of recommendation b) showed
some promise, however, it has not been extensively
studied and it requires expensive equipment and
specialized training.8 according to peterson and
cariello,9 investigators have tried many other interventions to prevent or treat oral mucositis including:
prostaglandins, antioxidants, nutritional supplements, growth factors, cytokines, anti-cytokines,
anti-inflammatory agents, antimicrobial agents,
rinses, oral care, and topical anesthetics. none of
these agents, however, has shown a consistent
benefit in reducing the incidence or the severity of
oral mucositis.
keratinocyte growth factor (kgf) is a growth
factor specific for epithelial cells that was first
isolated from a human embryonic lung fibroblast
cell line by rubin et al. 10 kgf belongs to a family of
growth factors called the fibroblast growth factor
family 7 ( xxxd2829xxx ) and serves as a paracrine factor in
mesenchymal-epithelial communication.11 when
kgf acts on epithelial cells, it has been found to
play an important role in epithelial cell proliferation,
migration, and morphogenesis. specifically in the
gastrointestinal tract, kgf promotes proliferation.
in rats, a six-day infusion of kgf significantly
increased the weight of stomach and small intestinal

tissue.12 recently, interest has been expressed in the
use of kgf as a cytoprotective agent due to its ability
to promote thickening of the oral epithelium.13 in a
mouse model of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, pretreatment with kgf protected against
mucosal injury and mortality.14
 xxxd2829xxx  (kepivancetm) is a recombinant form of
human kgf (rhukgf) produced in escherichia
coli.15 in  xxxd2829xxx , the first 23 n-terminal amino
acids found in endogenous kgf were deleted in order
to make the protein product more stable.  xxxd2829xxx 
was approved by the us food and drug administration in december 2004 to decrease the incidence and
duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with
hematologic malignancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell support.
although the food and drug administration has
only approved  xxxd2829xxx  for use in bmt in the
treatment of hematological malignancies, it is currently under investigation for use in other therapies
causing mucosal injury including colorectal cancer
chemotherapy regimens and head and neck radiation.

pharmacology
kgf binds to a splice variant of fibroblast growth
factor receptor 2 ( xxxg787xxx ) known as the kgf receptor
( xxxg792xxx ).16 epithelial tissues are the only tissue type
known to express  xxxg792xxx . when kgf binds to  xxxg792xxx 
in the oral mucosa it acts through a  xxxg2198xxx 
mediated pathway to enhance cell proliferation.
some cancers of epithelial origin have been found
to express  xxxg792xxx . this has raised concern that kgf
may stimulate proliferation of epithelial tumors. an in
vitro study of the effect of rhukgf on proliferation
of human epithelial tumor cells that expressed kgfrs
found that one of eight tumor samples showed
significant stimulation of proliferation.17 initial development of  xxxd2829xxx  has been limited to hematological malignancies as they do not express kgfrs and
are not a risk for tumor stimulation by kgf.

pharmacokinetics
in a phase 1 study of normal volunteers receiving
doses of  xxxd2829xxx  ranging from 0.2 20 mcg/kg,
serum concentration time profiles were found to be
triphasic.18 initially, a rapid distribution phase was
followed by a redistribution phase lasting from
1 6 hours post dose which was followed by a loglinear elimination phase.

radtke and kolesar:  xxxd2829xxx  for oral mucositis in patients with hematologic malignancies

according the manufacturer,15 following a single
intravenous dose of 60 mcg/kg of  xxxd2829xxx  total
body clearance (cl) appeared to be 2- to 4- fold
higher and volume of distribution at steady state (vss)
appeared to be 2-fold higher in cancer patients than
in healthy subjects. the elimination half-life (t1/2)
averaged 4.5 hours, ranging from 3.3 hours to
5.7 hours, and was found to be similar between
healthy subjects and cancer patients. no accumulation of  xxxd2829xxx  was noted after three consecutive
daily doses of 20 and 40 mcg/kg in healthy volunteers
or 60 mcg/kg in patients with cancer.

clinical efficacy

mucositis the average duration of this grade of
mucositis in the  xxxd2829xxx  group was six days
compared with nine days in the placebo group
(p b0.001). when all patients were considered,
regardless of occurrence of mucositis, the duration
of who grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis was significantly
(p b0.001) shorter for the  xxxd2829xxx  group (three
days) when compared with placebo (nine days). the
overall incidence of who grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis
was also significantly reduced in the  xxxd2829xxx  group
( xxxd2829xxx  63% versus placebo 98%, p b0.001).
the investigators also found, that when compared
with placebo,  xxxd2829xxx  was associated with better
outcomes such as: reductions in patient-reported
soreness of the mouth and throat (area-under-thecurve score  xxxd2829xxx  29.0 versus placebo46.8,
p b0.001), use of opioid analgesics (morphine
equivalents  xxxd2829xxx  212 mg versus placebo
535 mg, p b0.001), and incidence of use of parenteral nutrition ( xxxd2829xxx 31% versus placebo 
55%, p b0.001). the investigators concluded that
 xxxd2829xxx  significantly reduced the duration and
severity of oral mucositis and improved clinical
outcomes. adverse events were similar in the two
groups, and most were attributable to the underlying
cancer, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or tbi. adverse
events occurring 5% or more frequently in the
 xxxd2829xxx  group compared to the placebo group
included rash, pruritis, erythema, mouth and tongue
disorders, and taste alterations and were mild and
transient. no patients withdrew from the study for
 xxxd2829xxx  toxicity.

after successful phase i and ii testing, spielberger
and colleagues19 conducted a a multi-center, doubleblind, phase iii study to determine the efficacy of
 xxxd2829xxx  in the prevention of oral mucositis in
patients with hematological cancers undergoing conditioning therapy consisting of fractionated tbi and
high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous
hematopoietic sct. in the trial 212 patients were
enrolled with 106 patients randomized to receive
60 mcg/kg per day of  xxxd2829xxx  intravenously for
three consecutive days starting three days before tbi
and an additional three consecutive days after transplantation for a total treatment course of six doses.
another 106 patients were randomized to receive
placebo intravenously on the same time schedule as
the treatment group. patients who were enrolled in
the study were at least 18 years of age, had a
karnofsky performance-status score of at least 70,
and had adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and
hepatic function, as determined by institutional
guidelines. the conditioning regimen consisted of
tbi that totaled 1200 cgy and was delivered in 6, 8,
or 10 fractions over a period of three or four days.
chemotherapy consisted of 60 mg/kg of etoposide
intravenously and 100 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide.
patients were evaluated for oral mucositis beginning
eight days prior to transplantation and continuing for
28 days after transplantation or until symptoms of
oral mucositis returned to a world health organization (who) grade 0, 1, 2, or 3. the single primary
endpoint of the study was the duration of who grade
3 (inability to swallow solid food) or who grade 4
(no form of alimentation possible) oral mucositis. the
investigators found a significant difference in this
primary endpoint when the  xxxd2829xxx  treatment
group was compared with placebo. among the
patients who experienced who grade 3 or 4 oral

other indications under investigation
further studies to evaluate the use of  xxxd2829xxx  in
other patient populations are ongoing.20  23 a phase
ii study of  xxxd2829xxx  was conducted in patients with
advanced colorectal cancer who were receiving
chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and  xxxd2462xxx .
the investigators saw a significant decrease, when
compared with placebo, in the incidence of who
grades 2, 3, and 4 mucositis as well as the duration of
oral mucositis in the  xxxd2829xxx  treatment group.21
another phase ii study of  xxxd2829xxx  was conducted
in head and neck cancer patients treated with either
standard (srt) or hyperfractionated irradiation (hrt)
and concurrent chemotherapy.23 the study showed
that  xxxd2829xxx  shortened the duration and lowered
the grade of oral mucositis only in the hrt and
concurrent chemotherapy patients. while initial
studies are promising, given the possibility of  xxxd2829xxx  stimulating tumor growth, further study, including the effect of  xxxd2829xxx  on survival, is required.

adverse effects
all adverse events associated with  xxxd2829xxx  administration occurred at rates similar to those of placebo.
the most commonly reported adverse events that
occurred with a higher incidence in patients treated
with  xxxd2829xxx  were skin toxicities, oral toxicities,
dysesthesias, and pain arthralgias.15 skin toxicities
included rash (62% versus placebo 50%), pruritis
(35% versus placebo 24%), and erythema (32% versus
placebo 22%). oral toxicities included mouth
or tongue thickness or discoloration (17% versus
placebo 8%) and altered taste (16% versus placebo
8%). dysesthesias including hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, and paresthesia occurred in 12% of
patients treated with  xxxd2829xxx  and 7% of placebo
patients. arthralgias occurred in 10% of patients
treated with  xxxd2829xxx  and 5% of placebo patients.
other common adverse reactions in patients treated
with  xxxd2829xxx  include edema (28% versus placebo
21%), pain (16% versus placebo 11%), and fever (39%
versus placebo 34%). elevated serum lipase (28%
 xxxd2829xxx  versus 23% placebo) and elevated serum
amylase (62%  xxxd2829xxx  versus 54% placebo) were
also reported. the most commonly reported serious
adverse events were fever, gastrointestinal events or
respiratory events.
 xxxd2829xxx  has not been studied in patients with
hepatic or renal insufficiency or in patients with
pulmonary disease.15 in a rat model, administration
of rhukgf caused proliferation of bronchiolar and
alveolar epithelial cells. these changes transiently
altered pulmonary function by reducing tidal volume,
increasing respiratory rate, and promoting symptoms
associated with restrictive or obstructive defects.24
 xxxd2829xxx  has not been studied in pediatric
populations, geriatric populations, or in pregnant or
nursing women.15
no formal drug drug interaction studies have been
conducted with  xxxd2829xxx .15 kgf, however, is part of
a family of growth factors produced by stromal cells
which are characterized by their ability to bind to
heparin.10 the manufacturer recommends rinsing iv
lines with saline before and after  xxxd2829xxx  administration if heparin is being used to maintain the line.15
/

dosage, administration and cost
the manufacturer recommends giving  xxxd2829xxx 
as an intravenous bolus injection at a dosage of
60 mcg/kg per day iv bolus for three consecutive
days before (the third dose should be within 24 to

48 hours of starting myelotoxic therapy) and three
consecutive days after myelotoxic therapy (first of
these doses should be administered after, but on the
same day of hematopoietic stem cell infusion and at
least four days after the final dose of the initial dosing
sequence); a total of six doses is given. according to
the manufacturer, administering  xxxd2829xxx  within
24 hours of chemotherapy can result in an increased
sensitivity of rapidly dividing epithelial cells to the
cytotoxic agent. for this reason,  xxxd2829xxx  should
not be administered for 24 hours before, for 24 hours
after, or during the infusion of myelotoxic chemotherapy to avoid increasing the severity and the
duration of oral mucositis.15
 xxxd2829xxx  is supplied as 6.25 mg single-dose vial
of lyophilized powder that should be reconstituted
by addition of 1.2 ml of sterile water for injection,
usp, to give a final concentration of 5 mg/ml.15
contents of the vial should be swirled gently during
dissolution but should not be shaken.  xxxd2829xxx 
should be protected from light at all times. after
reconstitution  xxxd2829xxx  should be used immediately
or can be stored in the refrigerator in its carton for up
to 24 hours. if  xxxd2829xxx  is refrigerated it may be
allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum
of one hour before injection. the reconstituted
 xxxd2829xxx  solution should not be filtered either
during preparation or administration.
the average wholesale price (awp) for each
6.25 mg (1.2 ml) single-dose vial of  xxxd2829xxx  is
us$1650.00.25 estimated treatment cost for a single
course of therapy (six doses) is us$9900.00.

conclusion
prior to the introduction of  xxxd2829xxx , treatment
of mucositis consisted primarily of frequent oral
care (atraumatic cleaning and lubrication) combined
with symptomatic therapy for relief of pain and
inflammation. while frequent oral care is still
a mainstay of mucositis prevention,  xxxd2829xxx  is
the first agent to show a substantial benefit in
the prevention of oral mucositis and shortened
duration of oral mucositis caused by high-dose
chemotherapy and radiation treatment in patients
undergoing sct when compared to placebo. in
addition,  xxxd2829xxx  is well-tolerated.  xxxd2829xxx  has
the potential to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and
expense associated with sct as well as to improve
patient quality of life.
