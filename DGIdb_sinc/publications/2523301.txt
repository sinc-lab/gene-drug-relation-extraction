summary
synopsis

loratadine is a long acting antihistamine which has a high selectivity for peripheral
histamine hs-receptors and lacks the central nervous system depressant effects often associated with someofthe older antihistamines. results from controlled clinical trials have
shown that loratadine (usually jomg once daily) is a well-tolerated and effective antihistamine which willbe beneficial in patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.
it was found to be significantly superior to placebo, faster acting than  xxxd236xxx  and as
effective as usualdosages of terfenadine, clemastine,  xxxd2572xxx  and  xxxd255xxx  in eliciting reliefof symptoms. importantly, loratadine is associated with a lower incidence of
sedation than  xxxd255xxx , clemastine, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2572xxx .
thus, loratadine, with its convenience of once daily administration, will be a useful
addition to those drugs currently available for the treatment ofpatients with allergic diseases in whom a histamine hi-receptor antagonist is indicated. indeed, it is likelytofind
a place as one ofthe newer 'agents of choice' in this setting.

pharmacodynamic studies

loratadine is a potent, long acting antihistamine which has a high selectivity for
peripheral histamine hi-receptors and low affinity for hi-receptors in the cns in vitro
or in vivo. the drug displays little activity at acetylcholine or ai-adrenergic receptors,
and is inactive in animal models of assessing anticholinergic effects. loratadine penetrates poorly into the cns.
standard tests of antihistaminic activity in guinea-pigs have shown a greater potency
for loratadine than for comparator drugs such as terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx , promethazine
and diphenhydramine, with longer lasting effects (for 18 to 24 hours with loratadine vs
6 to 8 hours with  xxxd255xxx  or terfenadine). in man, suppression of wheal response to
intradermally injected histamine was greater with loratadine than with placebo or chlorpheniramine. the magnitude and duration of the response were dose related.
antiallergic activity has been demonstrated by loratadine in animal models in vivo.
in addition, the drug suppressed histamine release from rat mast cells.
a few psychomotor performance studies in small numbers of subjects have shown
that, in keeping with its lack of affinity for cns receptors, loratadine in doses up to 40mg
does not impair psychomotor function or potentiate the central effects of drugs such as
ethanol or diazepam.

pharmacokinetic studies

loratadine is rapidly absorbed after singie-dose oral administration, with peak plasma
concentrations of 5, ii and 26 /lgfl occurring i to 1.5 hours after the ingestion of 10,
20 and 40mg capsules, respectively; thus, for these doses loratadine pharmacokinetics
are not dose dependent, but dose proportional. similar results were obtained when 40mg
capsules were given once daily for 10 days to 12 healthy volunteers, indicating little
accumulation of loratadine with multiple once-daily administration.
the chief metabolite of loratadine, descarboethoxy-ioratadine (dcl), is pharmacologically active. similar to the parent compound, the pharmacokinetics of dcl are not
significantly altered by multiple dosing. although tissue distribution studies ofloratadine
in humans have not yet been published, singie-dose studies have reported elimination
half-lives of 8 to ii and 17 to 24 hours for loratadine and dcl, respectively. similar
values of 14 and 19 hours, respectively, were documented following multiple once daily
administration for 10 days. loratadine is secreted into breast milk but the amount is
minimal.
loratadine undergoes rapid and extensive biotransformation in humans with large
oral clearance values of 12 and 9 l/h/kg reported after singie-dose oral administration
of 20 and 40mg capsules in healthy volunteers, respectively. renal impairment and
haemodialysis, and administration to geriatric volunteers, appear to have no effect on
the disposition kinetics of both loratadine and dcl. in patients with alcoholic liver

disease the half-lives of loratadine and del are longer, but generally within the range
observed in a population of normal subjects.
therapeutic trials

loratadine has been evaluated in studies involving patients with allergic rhinitis (seasonal and perennial), acute coryza and chronic idiopathic urticaria. in short term clinical
trials in patients with seasonal rhinitis loratadine (usually iomg once daily) was found
to be as effective as  xxxd2281xxx  e hi-receptor antagonists such as terfenadine, c1emastine,
 xxxd2572xxx  and  xxxd255xxx , and to be quicker acting than  xxxd236xxx , as assessed by
global evaluation of symptom resolution. a dose of 5 to iomg once daily was shown to
be as effective as chlorpheniramine 2 to 4mg twice daily in 231 children aged from 6 to
12 years. loratadine iomg once daily was also as effective as terfenadine 60mg twice
daily and c1emastine img twice daily iii patients with perennial allergic rhinitis treated
for up to 6 months ; complaints of nasal stuffiness, postnasal drainage and nasal discharge
were reduced by approximately 50% in these clinical trials.
.
a combination tablet containing loratad ine 5mg and pseudoephedrine 120mg (administered twice daily) was significantly more effective (p < 0.05 to < 0.01) than its
individual components and placebo in relieving symptoms in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. similarly, the combination at the same dosage was significantly (p < 0.05)
better than placebo in relieving symptoms such as rhinorrhoea, nasal stuffiness, nasal
patency, nasal discharge, sneezing and hyperaemia in a 5-day double-blind clinical trial
involving 283 patients with acute head colds (coryza).
loratadine iomgonce daily produced significantly greater symptomatic improvement
(itching, erythema and hives) in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria than did placebo. furthermore, it tended to be more effective than terfenadine 60mg twice daily in
such patients treated for 28 days.

adverse effects

in studies reported thus far loratadine 5, 10 or 40mg once daily has been extremely
well tolerated and seemed to cause a lower incidence of sedation/somnolence than  xxxd255xxx , c1emastine, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2572xxx , administered at their usual dosages. indeed, in these studies loratadine did not appear to cause a significant increase in
adverse effects compared with placebo, was not associated with an increased frequency
of anticholinergic effects and did not induce any clinically significant changes in laboratory test indices.

dosage and administration

the recommended adult dosage of loratadine is 10mg once daily while that of the
combination tablet (ioratadine 5mg plus pseudoephedrine 120mg) is i tablet twice daily.

1. pharmacodynamic studies

loratadine is a potent, long acting antihistamine which is relatively specific for peripheral histamine hi-receptors, penetrates poorly into the cns
and thus lacks central nervous system (ens) depressant effects. structurally the drug is related to
 xxxd255xxx  (fig.i), with a neutral carbamate group
replacing  xxxd255xxx 's basic tertiary amino group and
a chloro group added to the benzocycloheptapyridine ring system.

1.1 receptor binding characteristics

1.1.1 hi-histamine receptors
in vitro loratadine binds selectively to peripheral histamine hi-receptors, displaying little or
no affinity for cns receptors. in competitively displacing 3h- xxxd3050xxx  binding, loratadine exhibited a 3-fold greater affinity for hi-receptor sites
in guinea-pig lung in vitro (k, = 35 nmol/l) than
in cerebral cortex (k, = 118 nmol/l; p < 0.05). in
this study loratadine was the only antihistamine
tested that showed a measurable difference in affinity for these sites; terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx , me-

promethazine (p < 0.05 between loratadine and
each drug) [barnett et al. 1984].
similarly, no anticholinergic effects have been
observed with loratadine as measured by the physostigmine lethality test in mice, and by the lack
of mydriasis in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys administered loratadine in doses much greater than
those required for antihistaminic activity (barnett
et al. 1984).
1.2 antihistaminic activity

quitazine and chlorpheniramine demonstrated no
significant differences in selectivity (ahn & barnett
1986).
however, technical difficulties in performing
binding experiments in vitro preclude any definite
conclusions as regards the relative selectivities of
the various compounds tested. indeed, an in vivo
experiment conducted in mice revealed that loratadine , terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  in antihistaminic doses did not significantly inhibit binding of
3h- xxxd3050xxx  to brain membranes (values of 6.2,
8.0 and 17.2%inhibition, respectively). in contrast,
chlorpheniramine,  xxxd255xxx , diphenhydramine and
promethazine were found to bind significantly to
ens receptors in this model (barnett et al. 1984).
in a study in rats administered loratadine 8 mg/
kg, no significant levels of radioactivity were found
in the brain or spinal cord (kneutner 1987), which
may account in part for its lack of effect at cns
receptors.

1.1.2 other receptors
loratadine possesses only weak affinity for aadrenoreceptors or acetylcholine receptors. the icso
value of loratadine in inhibiting binding of the aadrenoceptor antagonist wb 4101 was 64 /lmol/l,
compared with 21 /lmol/l for terfenadine, 4.9
/lmol/l for diphenhydramine and 0.32 /lmol/l for

1.2.1 animal studies
in animal models assessing antihistamine activity loratadine exhibited potent, long lasting effects.
the 50%effective dose (eo50) was reported as 0.19
and 1.3 mg/kg in standard tests including protection against histamine-induced lethality in guineapigs, and inhibition of histamine-induced paw oedema in mice (barnett et al. 1984;villani et al. 1986).
the eo 50 value (0.19 mg/kg) obtained for loratadine in the guinea-pig model was significantly less
(p < 0.05) than the values for diphenhydramine
(e0 50 = 8.0 mg/kg), promethazine (e050 = 0.43
mg/kg), terfenadine (e050 = 0.81 rug/kg) or  xxxd236xxx  (e0 50 = 0.62 mg/kg), indicating greater antihistaminic potency for loratadine than for the reference antihistamines in this model. antihistaminic
effects persisted for 18 to 24 hours after loratadine
administration, compared with 6 to 8 hours following  xxxd255xxx  and terfenadine use (barnett et
al. 1984; kneutner 1987).
1.2.2 human studies
wheal response to intradermally injected histamine (2/lg), a standard model of antihistamine activity , is suppressed by loratadine. some degree of
inhibition is evident within 1 or 2 hours of oral
administration, and maximal inhibitory effects occur within 2 to 4 hours (batenhorst et al. 1986;
kassem et al. 1988; roman et al. 1986).
both the magnitude and the duration of wheal
suppression are related to loratadine dose. kassem
et al. (1985) reported that in healthy volunteers the
average percentage of inhibition of wheal over a
48-hour period was 35%, 45%, 51% and 67% after

1.3 antiserotonin activity
loratadine was a more potent inhibitor of serotonin-induced bronchospasm in guinea-pigs than
was terfenadine (edso = 1.8 mg/kg vs 20 mg/kg)
[kreutner et al. 1987].

time (days)

fig. 2. suppression of wheal response to histamine in 60 volunteers given either placebo (~) , loratadine 10mg (_), 20mg (a),
40mg (e) or chlorpheniramine  xxxd2531xxx  (0) once daily for 28 days
(after roman et al. 1986). values are expressed as areas under
the curve (0 to 12 hours) [auco-12] for mean daily adjusted wheal
area.

loratadine 10, 20, 40 and 80mg, respectively. similarly, the duration of response increased from 12
hours after loratadine iomg, to 48 hours after loratad ine 40 and 80mg. these findings are in agreement with the observations of roman et al. (1986),
in a study of 60 healthy volunteers, that areas under the wheal area (mean daily adjusted values)time curves were reduced as loratadine dosage increased (fig. 2).
the inhibitory effect of loratadine on histamine-induced wheal formation is significantly
greater than that of placebo (kassem et al. 1988),
and in general has exceeded the effect of chlorpheniramine in comparative studies. batenhorst et
al. (1986) found that a single oral dose of loratadine 160mg inhibited wheal formation more than
did placebo (p < 0.003) over a 24-hour observation
period, whereas chlorpheniramine 4mg was superior to placebo only at 2, 3 and 8 hours after
administration. throughout a 28Â·day study conducted by roman et al. (1986), loratadine 40mg
daily suppressed wheal formation more effectively
than chlorpheniramine  xxxd2531xxx  once daily. furthermore, there was no development of tachyphylaxis
during the 4 weeks of loratadine administration.

loratadine administered orally exhibits antiallergic activity when assessed in animal models of
allergy. the drug inhibited bronchospasm induced
by histamine (edso = 0.19 mg/kg) and by specific
antigen (edso = 0.40 mg/kg) in guinea-pigs, and
suppressed changes in lung resistance and dynamic
lung compliance in rats with bronchospasm provoked by allergic anaphylaxis. in all test models
loratadine was more potent than terfenadine, which
had edso values of 1.8 mg/kg and 1.7 mg/kg, respectively, for histamine and antigen-induced
bronchospasm (kreutner et al. 1987).
antiallergic activity of loratadine has also been
reported in studies in humans using skin prick tests
(skassa-brociek et al. 1988b) and nasal challenge
methods (bousquet et al. 1988). loratadine was reported to have greater antiallergic activity than terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  in these trials; however,
insufficient details of methodology or results were
available from the published abstracts to confirm
this, or to judge the contribution of the antihistaminie activity to the effect.
1.5 mast cell mediator release

histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells
stimulated by con a or ionophore a23187 was
suppressed by loratadine (icso=12 to 13 umol/l).
in addition, the release of histamine, and leukotriene c4 from con a stimulated cloned murine
mast cells was inhibited by loratadine, as was the
uptake of 4sca++ (kreutner et al. 1987). temple
and mccluskey (1988) found that loratadine 1 to
20 jlmol/l inhibited antigen- and calcium iono. phore-induced release of leukotrienes, but not histamine, from human lung fragments.

loratadine: a preliminary review

1.6 central nervous system activity,
psychomotor performance and
sedation studies
in various animal models assessing cns effects,
including the sleep-waking cycle in the cat (ongini
et al. 1987) and standard tests of drug effects on
behavioural, neurological and autonomic function
in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys (barnett et al.
1984), loratadine displayed no significant activity
at doses much higher than those required for antihistaminic activity.
loratadine 10 or 20mg administered to small
numbers of healthy volunteers for 1 to 4 days in
general did not reduce psychomotor performance,
as measured by sleep latency, symbol copying, digit
symbol substitution, dynamic visual acuity tests or
driving performance, compared with placebo
(bradley & nicholson 1987; gaillard et al. 1988;
riedel et al, 1987; roth et al. 1987). there . was a
small but statistically significant (p < 0.03) increase in error scores of a continuous memory task
after both loratadine 10mg and terfenadine 60mg
in the study by gaillard et al. (1988), but both drugs
caused less deterioration than clemastine lrng in
the tracking test. the 40mg dose of loratadine was
found to cause a greater degree of impairment than
placebo, but this was not a consistent finding and
was still much less than that produced by triprolidine 10mg (bradley & nicholson 1987) or di- Â·
phenhydramine 50mg (roth et al. 1987).
preliminary findings in mice indicating that loratadine does not potentiate the effects of centrally
acting drugs such as diazepam, ethanol and barbiturates (iorio et al. 1986) have also been demonstrated in humans. in healthy volunteers, the
concomitant administration of loratadine 10 or
40mg and alcohol 0.75 to 1.07 g/kg bodyweight did
not impair psychomotor performance assessed by
subjective or objective tests, including driving performance, further than did placebo plus alcohol
(moser et al. 1986; riedel et al. 1987). in comparison, there was significant subjective, but not objective, impairment reported with terfenadine 60mg
plus alcohol, and both types of evaluation showed
deterioration in performance with clemastine img

47

in the study by moser et al. (1986), but there was
no deleterious effect of terfenadine in the study by
riedel et al. ,(1987). concomitant intake of loratadine 10mg with diazepam 5mg was shown not
to affect subjects' performance or reaction time and
tracking tests (gaillard et al. 1988).

2. pharmacokinetic studies
pharmacokinetic studies investigating the disposition of loratadine in humans have included
healthy adults, geriatric volunteers and patients with
renal impairment and alcoholic liver disease; in
addition, the excretion of the drug in human breast
milk has been reported. however, adequate tissue
distribution and biotransformation studies are
lacking. in addition, the full extent to which loratadine is absorbed in humans has not yet been
established and thus studies involving the intravenous administration of the drug would be helpful in this regard.
.the pharmacokinetic studies described below
have all examined single-dose loratadine kinetics
with the exception of the trial conducted by radwanski et al. (1987), in which the drug was given
once daily for 10 days. radioimmunoassay and
high-performance liquid chromatography, with detection limits of 0.3 p.gfl and 0.6 p.gjl, respectively, have been used to quantitate loratadine and
its chief metabolite, descarboethoxy-ioratadine
(dcl), in plasma, respectively (radwanski et al.
1987).
2.1 absorption
in man , loratadine is rapidly absorbed after oral
administration (hilbert et al. i987a,b; i988a,b;
katchen et al. 1985; radwanski et al. 1987). a linear relationship was demonstrated between loratadine dose and both the maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (avc) [hilbert et al.
1987b). loratadine capsules of 10, 20 and 40mg,
given as single oral doses to 12 healthy volunteers,
produced cmax values of 4.7, 10.8 and 26.1 p.gfl,

1987b. with permission).

when measured 1.5, 1 and 1.2 hours after dosing
(t max) , respectively (fig. 3). there were no differences in dose-adjusted avcs among the 3 dosage
regimens. when given as a single-dose liquid solution of 40mg, loratadine produced a cmax of 21
!j.g/l i hour after administration (katchen et al.
1985).
radwanski et al. (1987) investigated the kinetics
of loratadine following administration of 40mg
capsules once daily for 10 days in 12 healthy adults.
as in the single-dose studies reported above, loratadine was rapidly absorbed with cmax values on
days i and 10 of 21.3 and 27.1 !j.g/l, respectively.
these concentrations were reached at t max values
of 1.6 hours (first dose) and 1.4 hours (tenth dose).
steady-state plasma loratadine concentrations were
achieved by the fifth day, with avcs ranging from
80 to 96 !j.g/l â¢ h from the fifth to the tenth day of
administration. there was little accumulation of
loratadine in this multiple once-daily dosage study.
the major metabolite of loratadine, dcl, is
pharmacologically active (data on file, schering
corporation). when oralloratadine capsules of 10,
20 and 40mg were given in single-dose fashion to

12 healthy adults, cmax and t max values for del
were 4 !j.g/l at 3.7 hours, 9.9 !j.g/l at 1.5 hours and
16.0 !j.g/l at 2.0 hours (hilbert et al. 1987b; fig. 4). :
the multiple-dose study performed by radwanski
et al. (1987) also demonstrated that dcl is rapidly
formed, with a cmax of 17.4 !j.g/l occurring 2.9
hours post-dose on day 1 and a cmax value of 28.6
!j.g/l 3.0 hours post-dose on day 10. avc values
at steady-state (days 5 through 10) ranged from 349
to 421 !j.g/lÂ·h. thus, this study appeared to demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of loratadine
and dcl are not significantly altered following
administration of loratadine 40mg once daily for
10 days. in addition, the rapid absorption of loratadine and formation of dcl appears to be consistent with the reported onset of action of loratadine, which also occurs 1 to 2 hours after
administration (roman et al. 1986; section 1.2.2).
2.2 distribution

phasic disappearance of the drug from plasma, with
distribution half-lives (t'h j of 1.02 and 3.8 hours
for loratadine and dcl, respectively. similarly, a
single-dose study by katchen et al. (1985) reported
t'l", for loratadine to range between i and 2 hours
after oral administration of a 40mg s6iution. hilbert et al. (1987b) documented a mean t'h" value
of 0.9 hours after single-dose administration of both
20 and 40mg loratadine capsules and in this study ,
t'h" for dcl was 2.1 and 3.5 hours following
administration of loratadine 20 and 40mg, respectively.
to date , tissue distribution studies ofloratadine
in humans have not been published, although the
large clearance values following oral administration (section 2.3) of loratadine suggest extensive
distribution as well as extensive metabolism of the
drug in humans (hilbert et al. i987b). however,
specific data to document this are lacking. in
plasma from male volunteers, loratadine is 97 to
99% bound to plasma proteins, whereas dcl is 73
to 76% bound (data on file, schering corporation).

2.2.1 excretion in breast milk
hilbert et al. (1988b) measured the secretion of
loratadine and dcl into the breast milk of 6
healthy non-pregnant lactating volunteers given a
single 40mg oral capsule of loratadine, the results,
showing that the pharmacokinetics of loratadine
and dcl in lactating women were similar to those
reported in male volunteers (hilbert et al. 1987b;
radwanski et al. 1987), suggested little or no pharmacokinetic differences in loratadine disposition
due to patient sex or lactation. the breast milk
concentration of both loratadine and dcl paralleled its plasma concentrations, and cumulative
data indicated that after a single loratadine dose
the maximum amount of drug was excreted into
breast milk within 8 hours. furthermore, the loratadine and dcl milk: plasma concentration ratios were very close to i at all times, suggesting
that both compounds are primarily excreted into
breast milk by passive diffusion. the total amount
of loratadine and dcl excreted was minimal: after
48 hours , only 0.029% of the total loratadine and
dcl dose was excreted into breast milk.

2.3 elimination
single-dose studies have yielded elimination
half-lives (t'l' p) for loratadine and dcl of 8 to ii
and 17 to 24 hours , respectively (hilbert et al.
1987a,b). similarly, multiple administration for 10
days in 12 healthy subjects (40mg capsules given
orally once daily) resulted in elimination half-lives
of 14.4 and 18.7 hours, respectively (radwanski et
al. 1987).
loratadine undergoes rapid (section 2.1) and
extensive biotransformation in humans. large apparent clearance values of 12.1 and 8.5 lib/kg have
been reported after single-dose oral administration
of 20 and 40mg oral capsules of the drug in 12
healthy adults (hilbert et al. 1987b). in addition,
following administration of a 14c-ioratadine oral
solution of 40mg to healthy subjects most plasma
radioactivity was composed of conjugates of metabolites of dcl, and the radioactivity cleared with
a half-life of 46 hours - a rate similar to that at
which radioactivity was excreted in the urine. highperformance liquid chromatography analysis of the
radioactivity in the urine showed that only small
fractions were loratadine and dcl, while a larger
fraction was tentatively identified as hydroxy-dcl
(katchen et al. 1985).
2.4 effect of renal function on
pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetics of loratadine and subsequently formed dcl were investigated in a singledose study in 6 healthy subjects (group 1), 6 adults
with severe renal impairment (group 2) and 6
haemodialysis patients (group 3), given loratadine
40mg capsules orally (hilbert et al. i987a). although there was a large intersubject variability in
ave and c max data , differences in absorption
parameters among the 3 groups for loratadine, and
for the formation of dcl, were not significant.
similarly, a plot of oralloratadine clearance against
creatinine clearance yielded no significant correlation. hence, elimination half-lives for loratadine
of 8.7, 7.6 and 8.6 hours and for dcl of 18.2,23.9
and 14.9 hours were reported for the subjects in

loratadine: a preliminary review

groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. the authors also
investigated whether loratadine was cleared by
haemodialysis: group 3 subjects received another
oralloratadine 40mg capsule 7 days after receiving
the first dose. no differences between arterial and
venous loratadine or dcl plasma concentrations
were measured during dialysis, and no loratadine
and only very little dcl was found in the dialysate. thus, renal impairment and haemodialysis
appear to have negligible effects on the disposition
kinetics of either loratadine or dcl.
2.5 effect of alcoholic liver disease on
pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetics of loratadine and dcl
were investigated in 7 adults with alcoholic liver
disease. the elimination half-lives ofloratadine and
dcl in these subjects were longer, but generally
within the range observed in a population of normal subjects (data on file, schering corporation).

50

derly were similar to those observed in young
volunteers. in view of the large interindividual
variations, regardless of age, the small differences
in the pharmacokinetics ofloratadine seen between
the geriatric and the young population would not
appear to be of clinical significance.

3. therapeutic trials
the therapeutic efficacy of loratadine has been
investigated in allergic rhinitis, both seasonal and
perennial, acute coryza (common cold) and chronic
idiopathic urticaria. the majority of studies have
been reported to be well controlled (usually multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled comparisons with standard antihistamines) and have involved relatively large numbers of patients,
although some, presented in abstract form , supplied few details regarding clinical trial design. in
virtually all the stud ies reported to date, efficacy
was only assessed by subjective evaluation of
symptomatic improvement.

2.6 effect of age on pharmacokinetics
3.1 seasonal allergic rhinitis
the effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of
loratadine and dcl were investigated by hilbert
et al. (1988a) in 12 healthy volunteers aged 66 to
74 years given a single oral capsule of loratadine
40mg. loratadine was rapidly absorbed (cmax and
t max values were 50.5 /-lg/l and 1.5 hours, respectively), and the c max of dcl (28 /-lg/l) occurred
at a t max of 2.9 hours . avc studies indicated that
loratadine and dcl were almost completely eliminated from the plasma within 60 hours and 120
hours, respectively, while mean distribution and
elimination half-lives for loratadine and dcl were
1.5 and 18.2 hours , and 2.8 and 17.4 hours , respectively. the clearance of loratadine was 4.5 l/
h/kg .
thus, the above study reported that the elimination half-life of'loratadine in a geriatric population after a single 40mg oral dose was somewhat
higher than that observed in young (hilbert et al.
1987b) volunteers, and that there was a trend towards a lower clearance of the drug in the elderly.
however, the pharmacokinetics of dcl in the el-

ina double-blind study comparing loratadine
10 and 20mg, the drug was found to have a rapid
onset ofaction (approximately 27 minutes) with all
patients experiencing symptomatic relief within 45
minutes (roman 1988). after 5 days' treatment
total symptom scores were reduced by 70 to 74%
from baseline values and there was no apparent
difference between the 2 dosages.
results from short term studies (2 weeks' duration) comparing loratadine with alternative antihistamines and with placebo are summarised in
table i. except for the study of katelaris (1986),
the clinical trials summarised in table i were placebo-controlled and in each one loratadine 5, 10
or 40mg once daily, and the comparator hi-receptor antagonist in most cases, proved to be statistically significantly superior to placebo in relieving
symptoms of seasonal rhinitis. in these studies , loratadine was found to have a more rapid onset of
action than  xxxd236xxx  l omg once daily (kaminszczik et al. 1986; oei et al. 1987) and was as effec-

loratadine: a preliminary review

tive as traditional hi-histamine receptor antagonists such as  xxxd255xxx  img twice daily (katelaris
1986), chlorpheniramine 2 to 4mg twice daily
(meltzer 1987), c1emastine img twice daily (dockhom et al. 1987; irander et al. 1988; kemp et al.
i987a),  xxxd2572xxx  5mg twice daily (bruttmann
& pedrali 1985; skassa-brociek et al. 1988a) and
terfenadine 60mg twice daily (bedard et al. 1985;
bruttmann & pedrali 1987; gutkowski et al. 1988;
horak et al. 1988; passaleva & ricci 1988). central
nervous system side effects such as sedation and
somnolence occurred less frequently with loratadine than with  xxxd255xxx , chlorpheniramine, c1emastine and  xxxd2572xxx .
loratadine iomg once daily was as effective as
c1emastine img twice daily in reducing total symptoms and nasal symptoms as evaluated by physicians in 321 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis
(dockhom et al. 1987). indeed , in this placebocontrolled double-blind clinical trial loratadine
produced significantly greater relief of total nasal
symptoms and total symptoms (p < 0.05) after 7
days' treatment than did c1emastine (fig. 5). in another appropriately reported well-controlled clinical
trial, loratadine 40mg once daily and terfenadine

60mg twice daily were found to be equally effective
and well tolerated in 70 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (bruttmann & pedrali 1987). overall
good to excellent therapeutic response was documented in 14 of 23 loratadine-treated patients and
in 18 of 24 treated with terfenadine. gutkowski
and associates (1988) reported similar results with
loratadine 40mg once daily and teifenadine 60mg
twice daily in a double-b lind study involving 280
patients with ragweed hayfever; 48 of 91 loratadine-treated patients and 32 of 88 terfenadinetreated patients achieved a good to excellent response as measured by physicians' global evaluation. additionally, a lower dosage of loratadine
(i0mg once daily) was found to be as effective as
terfenadine 60mg twice daily in relieving nasal and
non-nasal symptoms in 256 patients with seasonal
rhinitis (horak et al. 1988). in this study, 58 of 87
loratadine-treated patients and 58 of 89 terfenadine-treated patients exhibited a good to excellent
therapeutic response compared with only 13 of 80
placebo-treated patients (p < 0.01 for both drugs
vs placebo).

loratadine: a preliminary review

rhinitis there has also been a report concerning its
use in children with seasonal rhinitis (meltzer 1987;
table i). in this mult icentre double-blind clinical
trial loratadine 5 to 10mg once daily and chlorpheniramine 2 to 4mg twice daily were equally efficacious in 231 children aged 6 to 12 years. however, at the end of the 2-week study loratadine lomg
once daily was significantly more effective than
chlorpheniramine 4mg twice daily and placebo in
children weighing > 30kg. furthermore, loratadine
tended to cause a lower incidence of sedation than
chlorpheniramine (i % vs 3%).
3.1.1 loratadine in combination with
pseudoephedrine
in addition to those studies described above in
which loratadine was used as monotherapy in
patients with seasonal rhinitis, there have been a
small number of reports evaluating the effectiveness of a combination tablet containing loratadine
5mg and the decongestant pseudoephedrine 120mg
(banov 1987; dockhorn et al. 1988; hebert et al.
1988; storms et al. 1988). the results from these
clinical trials have been very encouraging and, in
a 14-day multicentre double-blind study involving
417 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, the
combination tablet administered twice daily was
found to produce a statistically significant improvement in total symptom scores (p ~ 0.01) and
overall global evaluation (p < 0.01) compared with
its components and placebo administered in similar regimens (fig. 6; hebert et al. 1987, 1988). similarly, over a 4-week period, loratadine 5mg plus
pseudoephedrine 120mg administered twice daily
to 170 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis sig-'
nificantly improved (p < 0.05) both nasal and nonnasal symptoms compared with placebo (n = 81)
in a multicentre double-blind clinical trial. there
was no difference in the incidence of somnolence
between the 2 groups (grossman et al. 1987).

rhinitis treated with the same drug regimens for 28
days . in this latter study loratadine was found to
have a faster onset of action.
in another multicentre study , loratadine iomg
once daily and clemastine 1mg twice daily were
equally efficacious in relieving symptoms over a 6month period in 453 patients with perennial rhinitis (friedman 1987; pleskow 1987). in this study
clemastine caused a significantly higher incidence
of side effects compared with loratadine. notably,
sedation occurred in 26% of the clemastine group
but in only 7% of the loratadine group (p > 0.01).
in the above clinical trials loratadine 10mg once
daily produced an approximate 50% reduction in
the number of complaints of nasal stuffiness, postnasal drainage and nasal discharge (friedman
1987).
3.3 acute coryza (common cold)
in a multicentre placebo-controlled clinical trial
involving 283 patients with acute head colds loratadine 5mg plus pseudoephedrine 120mg was
shown to be effective in providing prompt symptomatic relief (connell 1987). compared with pla-

cebo, the combination product attained a significantl y better overall rating by both physicians (p
< 0.05) and patients (p < 0.05) and improved
symptoms such as nasal patency, rhinorrhoea, nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, sneezing and hyperaemia at some stage during the 5-day study. side
effects were infrequent and were generally equally
distributed between the 2 groups , although insomnia (4% vs 2%), nervousness (6% vs 3%) and dry
mouth (9% vs 2%) occurred more frequently with
the combination product than with placebo.
3.4 chronic urticaria
urticaria is a relatively common dermatological
condition which can be acute or chronic in nature;
chronic disease occurs far less frequently but is the
form most often seen by the dermatologist.
because of their ability to relieve the classic
symptoms of urticaria, particularly severe itching,
antihistamines have been a mainstay in the management of the disease . recently, adequate doses
of non-sedating drugs such as terfenadine and
 xxxd236xxx  have found considerable use (marks &
rawlins 1987).
loratadine has been evaluated in a number of
single- and multicentre double-blind clinical trials
conducted in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. loratadine 10mg once daily, as might be
expected, produced marked or complete relief of
symptoms in significantly more patients than placebo (48 vs 20% on day 7 and 59 vs 37% on day
28) in a 4-week clinical trial involving 153 patients
with chronic idiopathic urticaria (monroe et al.
1988; pleskow 1987). similar results in favour of
loratadine iomg once daily compared with placebo
were recorded in a 4 week double-blind clinical trial
involving 30 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (bernstein & bernstein 1988). furthermore,
pedrali and bruttmann (1986) found that loratadine iomg once daily elicited significantly greater
relief from symptoms of chronic urticaria and a
much lower treatment failure rate than terfenadine
60mg twice daily or placebo in a small number of
patients (n = 44) treated for 28 days. paul (1988)
also reported that loratadine 10mg once daily gave

loratadine: a preliminary review

complete symptomatic relief in more patients with
chronic urticaria than did terfenadine 60mg twice
daily (64 vs 52%) in a 28-day placebo-controlled
study. however, in the largest studies involving 172
patients (plaskow 1987) and 100 patients (solo et
al. 1987), loratadine iomg once daily and terfenadine 60mg twice daily were similarly effective over
a 28-day period and both drugs were significantly
superior to placebo .

4. adverse effects
friedman (1987) collated results from over 2,500
patients treated with loratadine, including 1,000
with perennial allergic rhinitis or allergic skin disorders who received the drug for up to 6 months,
and found it to be very well tolerated. sedation was
documented in 8% of loratadine-treated patients,
8% of those receiving terfenadine and in 6% of the
placebo group ; the highest incidence rate was 21%
and was observed in the group of patients treated
with c1emastine. furthermore, in the clinical trials
reported in section 3, loratadine 5, 10 or 40mg once
daily was at least as well tolerated as terfenadine
60mg twice daily (bedard et al. 1985; bruttmann
& pedrali 1987; horak et al. 1987; pleskow 1987)
and  xxxd236xxx  l omg once daily (bousquet 1987;
kaminszczik et al. 1986; oei et al. 1987), and appeared to cause a lower incidence of sedation/somnolence than  xxxd255xxx  img twice daily (katelaris
1986), c1emastine i mg twice daily (dockhorn et al.
1987; friedman 1987; kemp et al. 1987a,b; pleskow 1987), chlorpheniramine 2 to 4mg twice daily
(meltzer 1987), and  xxxd2572xxx  5mg twice daily
(bruttmann & pedrali 1985). additionally, many
of these studies were placebo-controlled and no
statistically significant differences in tolerability
were reported between the loratadine and placebo
groups. anticholinergic effects which have frequently occurred during treatment with traditional
antihistamines have not been a problem in clinical
studies involving loratadine. one patient treated
with loratadine 10mg once daily discontinued
therapy because of urticaria and angioedema (katelaris 1986). in those clinical trials which have

55

performed routine laboratory tests no clinically significant changes have been reported.

5. dosage and administration
the recommended adult dosage of loratadine is
iomg once daily. no paediatric dosage instructions
are currently available, although results from
clinical trials indicate that for children aged 6 to
12 years a dosage of 5 to 10mg once daily is appropriate (see section 3.1). a combination tablet
containing loratadine 5mg and pseudoephedrine
120mg is available and the recommended dosage
is i tablet to be taken twice daily in adults.

6. place of loratadine in therapy
antihistamines have traditionally been employed in the management of clinical allergic conditions such as seasonal and perennial allergic
rhinitis and conjunctivitis, urticaria and angioedema. some of the older more established agents
have produced adverse effects, notably cns (sedation) and anticholinergic in nature, which have
imposed a significant limitation on their usefulness. however, in recent years newer antihistamines such as terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  have
evolved and have been associated with much lower
incidences of adverse reactions (for reviews see
dockhorn & shellenberger 1987; friedman 1987;
richards et al. 1984; sorkin & heel 1985). it is
against this background that loratadine has been
developed and should be evaluated.
pharmacodynamic studies have confirmed that
loratadine is a potent, long acting antihistamine
which is selective for peripheral histamine hi-receptors and lacks the cns depressant effects that
occur with older antihistamines. preliminary indications from clinical trials published thus far
provide convincing evidence that loratadine is a
well tolerated and effective antihistamine which will
be beneficial in patients with allergic rhinitis and
chronic urticaria. in controlled comparative studies, loratadine administered once daily was significantly more effective than placebo, faster acting
than  xxxd236xxx  and as effective as other histamine

loratadine: a prelim ina ry review

h i-receptor antagonists such as terfenadine, clemastine ,  xxxd2572xxx  and  xxxd255xxx  administered
in their usual dosages. importantly, loratadine did
not appear to cause a significant increase in any
adverse reactions compared with placebo and was
associated with a lower incidence of sedation/
somnolence than  xxxd255xxx , clemastine, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd2572xxx . in this respect loratad ine
seemed to be equivalent to  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine.
thus , barring unexpected findings with wider
clinical use, loratadi ne may well become one of the
newer antihistamines 'of choice' for many patients
with allergic rhiniti s, chronic urticaria or other
conditions for which a histam ine h i-receptor antagonist is advocated .
