abstract
fatty acid synthetic metabolism is abnormally elevated in tumor cells,
and pharmacological inhibitors of the anabolic enzyme  xxxg765xxx 
(fas), including the natural product  xxxd463xxx  and the novel synthetic
compound c75, are selective inhibitors of tumor cell growth. we have
recently reported that these two fas inhibitors both produce rapid,
potent inhibition of dna replication and s-phase progression in human
cancer cells, as well as apoptotic death. here we report an additional
characterization of the cellular response to fas inhibition. rko colon
carcinoma cells were selected for study because they undergo little apoptosis within the first 24 h after fas inhibition. instead, rko cells
exhibited a biphasic stress response with a transient accumulation in s
and g2 at 4 and 8 h that corresponds to a marked reduction in cyclin aand b1-associated kinase activities, and then by accumulation of p53 and
p21 proteins at 16 and 24 h and growth arrest in g1 and g2. the response
of rko cells to fas inhibition resembled a genotoxic stress response, but
dna damage did not appear to be an important downstream effect of fas
inhibition, because none was detected using the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) to assess dna damage. p53 function is
probably important in protecting rko cells from fas inhibition because,
similar to many other tumor lines, rko cells expressing a dominant
negative mutant p53 gene underwent extensive apoptosis within 24 h after
fas inhibition. sensitization of cells to fas inhibitors by the loss of p53
raises the possibility that these agents may be clinically useful against
malignancies carrying p53 mutations. whereas induction of apoptosis
appeared related to accumulation of the substrate, malonyl-coa, after
fas inhibition, the cytostatic effects were independent of malonyl-coa
accumulation and may have resulted from product depletion.

introduction
fas,3 (e.c. 2.3.1.85) is the major biosynthetic enzyme for the
synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx  from small carbon substrates. fas is a
multifunctional enzyme that performs seven sequential reactions to
convert acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa to palmitate. elevated expression of fas and abnormally active endogenous fatty acid synthetic
metabolism are frequent phenotypic alterations in many human cancers, including carcinomas of breast, prostate, endometrium, and
colon (1–5). the function(s) that active fatty acid synthesis provides
for tumor cells appears linked to proliferation, and the bulk of endogenously synthesized  xxxd2154xxx  are incorporated into membrane
lipids by proliferating tumor cells (4, 6, 7). endogenous fatty acid
synthetic activity occurs in tumors despite available dietary fatty acid,
which down-regulates the pathway in most normal tissues (8 –10).
the biological basis for this phenotypic alteration is not clear.
however, altered fatty acid metabolism represents a novel target for
anti-metabolite therapy because pharmacological inhibition of fas is

selectively cytotoxic for tumor cells, triggering their programmed cell
death (11, 12). the cytotoxic mechanism of fas inhibition appears to
result from accumulation of the committed substrate, malonyl-coa,
or from related biochemical consequences of the inhibition of an
active metabolic pathway, inasmuch as pathway down-regulation
before fas inhibition rescues tumor cell survival (13). to gain
additional insight into the biological role of the fatty acid synthetic
pathway for tumor cells and the nature of the growth inhibition
resulting from the inhibition of fas, we have examined the cellular
events that follow inhibition of fas and precede cell death.
two chemically distinct inhibitors of fas were studied in parallel
to provide a generic picture of the consequences of the loss of fas
function.  xxxd463xxx , (2r, 3s)-2,3-epoxy-4-oxo-7,10-trans, transdodecadienamide, a natural product of cephalosporium caerulens, is
a specific inhibitor of fas enzymes across a broad phylogenetic
spectrum (14 –16).  xxxd463xxx  irreversibly inhibits fas by binding
covalently to the active site cysteine of the ␤ keto acyl synthase
moiety, which performs the condensation reaction between the elongating fatty acid chain and each successive acetyl or malonyl residue.
in saccharomyces cerevisiae, a point mutation in fas that confers a
30-fold reduction in affinity of the enzyme for  xxxd463xxx  also abolishes the growth inhibitory effects of the drug accordingly, demonstrating that fas is a critical target for cytotoxic effects of the drug
(17). recently we have synthesized a novel small-molecule inhibitor
of fas, an ␣-methylene-␥-butyrolactone with a c7 hydrocarbon side
chain, called c75, with comparable inhibitory effects on fatty acid
synthesis (18).
we have recently reported that fas inhibitors produce rapid,
profound blocks of dna replication and s-phase progression in
human cancer cells (19). fatty acid synthesis inhibition occurred
within 30 min and dna synthesis inhibition occurred within 90 min
of drug exposure, and induction of apoptosis followed several hours
later. the suppressive effect of fatty acid synthesis inhibition on dna
replication was indirect, because expression of certain viral oncogenes
alleviated it. here, we report a additional characterization of the
cellular response to fas inhibition. rko colon carcinoma cells were
selected for study because they undergo little apoptosis within the first
24 h after fas inhibition. instead, rko cells exhibit a biphasic stress
response marked by early loss of s phase and g2 cyclin-dependent
kinase activity and the subsequent accumulation of p53 and p21
proteins, which may protect rko cells from the cytotoxic effects of
fas inhibition.

were added from 5 mg/ml stock solutions; the final concentration of dmso in
cultures was ⱕ0.2%.
flow cytometry and detection of apoptosis. cells were exposed to
 xxxd463xxx  or c75 for the indicated doses and time intervals and then detached
from plastic with trypsin for flow cytometry analysis. apoptosis and dna
content were measured concurrently by multiparameter flow cytometry using
a facstarplus flow cytometer equipped with argon and krypton lasers (becton
dickinson). apoptosis was quantified using 10 ␮g/ml merocyanine 540 (sigma), which detects altered plasma membrane phospholipid packing that occurs
early in apoptosis (19, 22–24). merocyanine 540-positive cells were identified
using 488-nm excitation from an argon laser and a 575-nm df26 bandpass
filter for collection of events with increased red fluorescence. dna content
was simultaneously measured from cells stained with 10 ␮m hoechst 33342
(ho33342; molecular probes). cells treated with ho33342 were excited with
350 –356-nm light from a krypton laser, and emitted light was collected using
a 467-nm df22 bandpass filter. data were collected and analyzed using
cellquest software (becton dickinson). determination of the percentages of
cells in g1, s and g2-m was done with multicycle software (phoenix flow
systems). figures show representative results of at least two independently
performed experiments.
brdurd detection by laser scanning cytometry. dual-parameter detection of brdurd labeling and dna content was performed using a laser
scanning cytometer (compucyte corp.). cell cultures were pulse-labeled for
20 min with 10 ␮m brdurd and chased for the indicated times in the absence
or presence of drug, then detached from plastic with trypsin,  xxxd102xxx fixed, and
applied to glass slides. cells were subjected to standard heat-induced epitope
retrieval (dako) before staining with anti-brdurd antibody (dako) and
fitc-conjugated goat antimouse antibody (caltag, dako autostainer).
dna content was assessed after staining with 0.5%  xxxd3027xxx . data
were collected and analyzed using wincyte software (compucyte corp.).
immunoprecipitation and immunocomplex-kinase assay. rko cells
(5 ⫻ 106/100-mm plate) were treated with 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd463xxx  or c75 for the
indicated time intervals. the control cells received equivalent amounts of
dmso. after drug treatment, the plates were washed once and lysed with
immunoprecipitation buffer [150 mm tris (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl, 1% triton
x-100, 0.5% np40, 1 mm ethyleneglyco-bis-tetraacetic acid, 0.2 mm sodium
vanadate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. protein concentration
was measured using the bca protein assay kit (pierce). one hundred ␮g of
protein from each sample were incubated at 4°c for 1 h with 1 ␮g of primary
antibody (antihuman  xxxg365xxx  rabbit polyclonal antibody or antihuman cyclin
b1 monoclonal antibody; santa cruz) and then overnight after the addition of
protein a or protein g-sepharose (santa cruz). the immunoprecipitates were
washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with kinase buffer [10

mm tris (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl, and 0.5 mm dtt] and
resuspended in 40 ␮l of kinase buffer containing 1 ␮g of histone h1, 25 ␮m
of atp, and 2.5 ␮ci of ␥-32p-atp. after a 30-min incubation at 30°c, the
reaction was terminated by adding 40 ␮l of 2⫻ laemmli sample buffer.
samples were resolved by electrophoresis through 12% sds-polyacrylamide
gels and quantitated on a storm 820 system (molecular dynamics). all
samples were run in duplicate, and each experiment was performed at least
twice. means and standard errors of one representative experiment are shown
in fig. 3b.
immunoblot analysis. one million cells/60-mm plate were treated with
10 ␮g/ml  xxxd463xxx  or c75 in duplicate for the indicated time intervals; control
cells received equivalent amounts of dmso. after drug treatment, cells were
lysed with 200 ␮l laemmli sample buffer and boiled. ten ␮l of each lysate per
lane was separated by sds-page, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed
to antibodies against p53 (pab1801; oncogene research products), p21 (6b6;
pharmingen), or actin (i-19; santa cruz), and then horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat antimouse or rabbit antigoat antibody (pierce), enhanced
chemiluminescence (amersham), and autoradiography.
determination of fatty acid synthesis pathway activity. cells were
plated at 5 ⫻ 104/well in 1 ml in 24-well plates and incubated overnight. fatty
acid synthesis was assayed with a 2-h pulse of [u-14c]acetic acid, 1 ␮ ci/well,
before folch extraction and scintillation counting (6). for determination of
residual pathway activity after fas inhibitor exposure (fig. 7b), a 3-h pulse of
u-[14c]acetic acid, 1 ␮ci/well, was performed after 2 h of drug exposure. all
determinations were in triplicate. data are presented as mean values, with bars
showing the se. calculations and graphing were performed in prism 2.0
(graphpad).
clonogenic assays. subconfluent cells were exposed to the indicated drug
concentrations for 6 h, then detached from plastic with trypsin, counted, and
replated for colony formation. clones were fixed, stained with crystal violet
(0.1%; sigma) and counted 1 week later. data are presented as mean values,
with bars showing the se. calculations and graphing were performed in prism
2.0 (graphpad).
single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. mcf7 breast cancer
cells were treated with  xxxd463xxx  or c75 for 3 h at doses bracketing 75%
survival at 24 h. all experiments were repeated three times, and duplicate
slides from each experiment were prepared and scored.
the comet assay was performed under alkaline conditions, essentially as
described (25), with some modifications. in brief, cells were suspended in
0.5% low-melting point agarose (lma; trevigen) and spread on glass microscope slides precoated with 1% normal agarose. after immersion in lysis
solution (trevigen) at 4°c for a minimum period of 1 h to remove cellular
proteins, the slides were immersed in electrophoresis buffer [300 mm naoh,

results
fas inhibitors induce delays in cell cycle progression. recent
studies of the role of endogenous fatty acid synthesis in tumor cell
biology suggested linkage of fatty acid synthesis to proliferation (6, 7,
26), and the  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors  xxxd463xxx  and c75 to
suppressed dna synthesis and inhibited s phase progression (19).
additional investigation by flow cytometric analysis of serial samples
taken after fas inhibition demonstrated a biphasic effect on the cell
cycle progression of rko colon carcinoma cells (fig. 1). when
proliferating cells were exposed to 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd463xxx , there was a
redistribution of cells into s phase and g2-m during the early time
points, at 5 and 8 h, compatible with inhibited progression through
these cell cycle phases. later, at 16 and 24 h, the s-phase fraction
decreased substantially, with a redistribution of cells into g1 and
g2-m. this effect was characteristic of both  xxxd463xxx  and c75 treatment on rko cells, as well as on other cell lines that had limited
apoptotic responses to fas inhibitors (not shown).
a similar experiment measured cell cycle progression by pulse/
chase labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (brdurd, fig. 2). the progress of brdurd pulse-labeled rko cells through the cell cycle was
monitored over 24 h without inhibition of fas, or during exposure to
 xxxd463xxx  (10 ␮g/ml) or c75 (10 ␮g/ml). a 20-min exposure of
proliferating cells to brdurd labeled the s-phase population at time 0.
chase samples were collected at 4, 8, 16, and 24 h. in control cultures
(fig. 2a), the brdurd-labeled population progressed through g2-m,
first reappearing in the g1 population in the 8-h chase sample. by
16 h, the brdurd-labeled population was in g1 and s phase again,
indicating a complete cell cycle traverse time of approximately 16 h
for rko cells. by 24 h, labeled and unlabeled populations were
distributed throughout the cell cycle, indicating continued progression
and loss of synchronization (not shown). rko cells treated with fas

inhibitors demonstrated substantial delays in cell cycle progression
that corresponded with the flow cytometry single-parameter cell cycle
results (fig. 1). the  xxxd463xxx -treated samples are shown in fig. 2b;
c75-treated populations exhibited a similar response (not shown). the
treated 8-h chase sample showed no brdurd-labeled cells yet reappearing in g1, which was in agreement with our observation, seen in
fig. 1, that cells redistribute into the s and g2-m phases. by 16 h,
most of the brdurd-labeled cells had reentered g1, but very few had
entered s phase, and by 24 h most cells, labeled and unlabeled, were
in g1 or g2-m and were still synchronized, indicating that cell cycle
progression had slowed down substantially.
fas inhibitors induce inhibition of s phase and g2 cdk
activity during the early period of exposure. cell cycle progression is regulated through the sequential activation and inactivation of

activity during the early period of exposure. after rko cells were exposed to fas
inhibitors for the indicated time periods,  xxxg365xxx - and cyclin b1-associated kinase
activities were determined by an immunocomplex-kinase assay.

growth inhibition by  xxxg765xxx  inhibitors

fig. 4. accumulation of p53 and p21 is induced in rko colon carcinoma cells by
pharmacological inhibitors of fas. cells were treated with  xxxd463xxx  (10 ␮g/ml; a) or c75
(10 ␮g/ml; b) for the stated exposure times and analyzed by immunoblotting for p53 and
p21 protein content using actin as an internal control.

fas (fig. 4). p53 and p21 protein levels were unchanged or decreased
during the early period of fas-inhibitor exposure. however, treatment with 10 ␮g/ml of either  xxxd463xxx  or c75 induced accumulation
of p53 and p21 protein at 16 and 24 h in rko cells (fig. 4). of note,
p21 mrna levels did not show increases of the same magnitude,
suggesting a translational and/or posttranslational mechanism(s) regulating p21 accumulation (not shown).
to determine whether significant dna damage occurred after
fas-inhibitor exposure, alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was performed on mcf7 breast cancer cells after exposure
to concentrations of  xxxd463xxx  and c75 that resulted in 75% survival
(fig. 5). this assay detects dna strand breaks and a spectrum of
alkali-labile dna damage at low levels (25, 29). neither  xxxd463xxx 
nor c75 induced olive tail moments over background values for
untreated control cells, indicating that dna damage was not induced
by either agent at doses previously shown to induce inhibition of dna
synthesis and to reduce clonogenic activity (13, 19). this suggests that
c75 and  xxxd463xxx  induced cytotoxic, not genotoxic, damage to cells in
an assay that under similar conditions readily detected dna damage
induced by 5 cgy of ␥ irradiation or 25 ␮m h2o2. a similar absence
of dna damage was seen after drug treatment of gm1310b human
lymphoblasts (not shown).
loss of p53 function substantially increased the sensitivity of
tumor cells to fas inhibitors. inhibition of fas induced p53 and
p21 protein accumulation and g1/g2 redistribution in rko cells,
which have an intact p53 pathway (and in other cell lines with
wild-type p53, not shown). however, many tumor lines with p53
mutations undergo apoptosis within 24 h of exposure to fas inhibitors (19). we therefore sought to determine the effect of p53 function
on survival after fas inhibition by comparing two pairs of isogenic
cell lines with wild-type and altered p53 function. rko cells were

c75-treated mcf7 breast carcinoma cells were subjected to alkaline single cell gel
electrophoresis (comet assay). olive tail moment indicates electrophoretic mobility of
dna induced by dna damage. lymphoblasts exposed to 0 or 1 gy ␥ irradiation had
olive tail moments of 0.9 ⫾ 0.3 and 7.1 ⫾ 0.8 in this experiment. exposure to 5 cgy ␥
irradiation typically produces an olive-tail moment of twice the control.

cdks that, in turn, phosphorylate key regulatory proteins (27). cyclin
a/ xxxg410xxx  complex activity is required for efficient dna replication, and
the activity of complexes containing  xxxg407xxx  and cyclins a and b is
required for passage through g2 and mitosis. the effect of fas
inhibitors on the activity of cyclin/cdk complexes in rko cells was
determined in a time-course analysis. as shown (fig. 3), the kinase
activity associated with immunoprecipitated complexes containing
 xxxg365xxx  decreased to ⬍40% of control levels at 4 and 8 h after
exposure to either  xxxd463xxx  or c75, then increased moderately at later
time points. the kinase activity associated with immunoprecipitated
cyclin b decreased to ⬍5% of control levels by 4 and 8 h after
exposure to either  xxxd463xxx  or c75, then increased to ⬎80% of control
levels at 16 and 24 h. these changes in s and g2 cdk activity
correlated well with the biphasic pattern of cell cycle distribution
demonstrated in fig. 1 and 2. immunoblots of  xxxg365xxx  and b levels
performed in parallel with the experiment in fig. 3 demonstrate that,
unlike the associated kinase activities, the cyclin levels do not decrease until 24 h (not shown).
fas inhibitors induce p53 and p21 accumulation, but not
dna damage. the delays in cell cycle progression, with redistribution of cells into g1 and g2 after fas inhibition, were suggestive of
cell cycle checkpoint activation by the  xxxg2313xxx , which
occurs after genotoxic or other cellular stresses (28). accumulation of
p53 protein, and the p53-regulated cdk-inhibitor p21waf1/ xxxg418xxx , were
assayed by immunoblotting in a parallel time course after inhibition of

rendered p53-mutant by stable transfection with a dominant-negative
mutant p53 gene (rko-p53); the human breast carcinoma cell line
mcf7 was rendered p53-deficient by constitutive expression of the
human papilloma virus 16 e6 gene (mcf7-e6; 21). the loss of p53
function sensitized rko and mcf7 cells to the cytotoxic effect of
fas inhibition. there was a large, dose-dependent increase in apoptosis after  xxxd463xxx  exposure in rko-p53 cells compared with the
parent rko line (fig. 6). the cell cycle distribution of the nonapoptotic (lower boxes) and apoptotic (upper boxes) subpopulations
of rko cells after 24 h of exposure to 5 or 10 ␮g/ml  xxxd463xxx  was
determined by multiparameter flow cytometry. cell cycle position
(dna content) was determined with ho33342 dye, and apoptosis was
detected by bright staining with merocyanine 540 (mc540), which
detects conformational changes in the plasma membrane that occur
early during apoptosis (22–24). the validity of mc540 staining as a
measure of entry into apoptosis has been confirmed in our experimental system by evaluation of morphology, change in light scatter

parameters, and tunel dna end-labeling in parallel experiments
(refs. 13 and 19 and data not shown). entry into apoptosis after fas
inhibition by  xxxd463xxx  occurred from g1, s, and g2-m without
increased sensitivity in any subpopulation. apoptosis with lack of cell
cycle phase specificity was typical of many experiments with several
cell lines (not shown). the fatty acid synthetic pathway activity in
these paired lines was very similar, so loss of p53 function had no
discernable effect on fatty acid synthesis level (fig. 7a). and the fas
inhibitors produced comparable reduction of pathway activity in the
paired lines (fig. 7b; refs. 13 and 19). a similar apoptotic response
was seen with three independent rko-p53 clones and with mcf7-e6,
and was seen after exposure to c75 (fig. 7, c and e, and data not
shown). the cytotoxic effects of the fas inhibitors on these paired
lines were also tested by clonogenic assay (fig. 7, d and f). comparison of the two cytotoxicity assays shows that inhibition of fas
causes a reduction in the number of clonable rko and mcf7 cells
that is not detected by the apoptosis assay. the clonogenic assay

probably detects subpopulations undergoing growth arrest and potentially other growth-inhibitory processes in addition to those undergoing rapid apoptosis. however, it appears that the early apoptosis
associated with loss of p53 function illustrated in fig. 6 reduces
further the clonable fraction, resulting in sensitivity to fas inhibitors
that is comparable with that seen with other lines bearing naturally
occurring p53 mutations (sw480 colon carcinoma and skbr3 breast
carcinoma cells).
fas inhibitor-induced growth arrest is independent of
malonyl-coa accumulation. accumulation of malonyl-coa, the
committed substrate for fatty acid synthesis, is likely to participate in
the cytotoxicity of fas inhibition, inasmuch as down-regulation of
malonyl-coa production alleviated the toxicity of  xxxd463xxx  and c75
and substantially reduced the apoptotic fraction at 24 h (13). to
determine the role of malonyl-coa accumulation in delaying cell
cycle progression, rko cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after
8 or 24 h of fas inhibitor exposure, without or with pretreatment for
1 h with the acetyl-coa carboxylase inhibitor, tofa, which blocks
the carboxylation of acetyl-coa to form malonyl-coa (fig. 8). cells
pretreated with tofa, and then with  xxxd463xxx  or c75, showed similar
or greater cell cycle delays than cells exposed only to the fas
inhibitors. of note, however, tofa pretreatment did rescue fas
inhibitor-mediated apoptosis in rko-p53 cells, similar to earlier
results (ref. 13 and not shown), indicating that the effects of fas
inhibitors on cell cycle progression are distinct from those mediating
apoptotic cell death.
discussion
the biphasic stress response to fas inhibition may result
from lipid product depletion. the kinetics of the response of rko
cells to fas inhibition illustrated in figs. 1– 4 suggests the rapid onset
of a stress response. this response is characterized by a marked
reduction in  xxxg365xxx - and b-associated kinase activities, an early
suppression of dna replication, and an accumulation of cells in the
s and g2 phases during the first 8 h of drug exposure, and then by
enhanced expression of p53 and p21 proteins, and growth arrest in g1

although malonyl-coa accumulation appears involved in triggering apoptosis after fas inhibition, the growth arrest stress response
produced by fas inhibition may be attributable to altered lipid
production, because acetyl-coa carboxylase inhibition did not relieve
it. most of the  xxxd2154xxx  produced by tumor cells are incorporated
into membrane phospholipids, and phospholipid synthesis is inhibited
when fatty acid synthesis is inhibited (6, 7). phospholipid biosynthesis
is greatest during the g1 and s phases, with doubling of the membrane
mass occurring during s phase in preparation for cell division (30). it
is possible, therefore, that limitation of phospholipid synthesis during
the s phase affects dna replication, or independently triggers late
cell cycle delays similar to the premitotic checkpoints of yeast (31,

32). notably, two ether lipids that specifically inhibit ctp: xxxd2929xxx  cytidylyltransferase, an important enzyme in phospholipid
synthesis, produce similar g2-m delays and are selectively cytotoxic
to transformed cells (33). studies in lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes
have shown a requirement for active fatty acid synthesis at the time of
cell division, either for simple mitosis or for sporulation (34). the
defects in these systems appear related to chromatin configuration or
to the transcriptional activation of key genes. in the fas inhibition
system discussed here, however, the specific mechanisms whereby
 xxxg365xxx - and b-associated kinase activities decrease in rko cells
remain to be studied in detail.
role of  xxxg2313xxx  in the response to fas inhibitors. the observation that fas inhibitors induced the accumulation
of p53 and p21 proteins suggested that dna damage might be
occurring, either as a direct effect of the drugs on the dna molecule,
or as a downstream effect of fas inhibition. however, several other
observations argue against dna damage. first, the toxic effect of
 xxxd463xxx  was found to be dependent on its ability to inhibit fas in
yeast, thus ruling out a significant direct effect of  xxxd463xxx  on dna
(17). second, toxicity in tumor cells is modulated by alterations in
pathway activity and substrate levels (13, 19). finally, no dna
damage was detected using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet)
screening assay, which has been shown to be very sensitive in detecting low levels of dna damage. consistent with these observations,
no differences were detected in the sensitivity to fas inhibitors of
cells deficient in atm (mutated in ataxia telangectasia) versus controls (not shown).
whereas the first and most extensively studied function described
for the tumor suppressor protein p53 was the induction of growth
arrest and apoptosis after dna damage (20, 35–37), more recently,
important roles for p53 have been recognized in the cellular responses
to a variety of nongenotoxic metabolic stresses, including hypoxia,
acidosis, and perturbations of rna and protein synthesis (38 – 43).
the current study indicates that perturbation of fatty acid synthesis
also belongs on the list of metabolic stresses regulated by p53.
the decision between apoptosis and growth arrest after fas inhibition clearly is influenced by p53 function. because constitutive fatty
acid synthesis activity and inhibitor effects were similar between the
paired parental and p53 deficient cells, it is unlikely that levels of
malonyl-coa accumulation were substantially different. the ability
of the cell to survive malonyl-coa accumulation may be greater in
cells with intact p53. the relatively low fatty acid synthesis pathway
activity of rko cells (less malonyl-coa) combined with intact p53
function may underlie the minimal apoptosis produced by fas inhibitors in rko cells and in various nontransformed cells.4 it is likely
that induction of p21 promotes growth arrest and exerts a protective
effect after fas inhibition, as it has been shown to do in a variety of
4

other stress paradigms (44). the triggering of apoptosis after fas
inhibition is very rapid, and probably occurs before p21 induction.
fas inhibitors triggered comparable apoptotic responses in the majority of tumor lines with mutant p53 status that we have studied. the
predominant pattern of sensitization by loss of p53 function suggests
that endogenous fatty acid synthesis will hold special appeal as an
experimental therapeutic target. fas inhibitors combine the target
specificity for cancer cells afforded by both elevated fatty acid synthesis and the loss of p53 function.
