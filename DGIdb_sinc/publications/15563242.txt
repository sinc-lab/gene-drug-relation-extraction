abstract

 xxxd3284xxx  [ xxxd3284xxx ,  xxxd3284xxx ,  xxxd3284xxx ™,  xxxd3284xxx ] is a novel
synthetic retinoid that is in development with nippon shinyaku as a potential
treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (apl) and is pending approval in
japan.  xxxd3284xxx  was being developed by shionogi in japan but the company
subsequently discontinued its involvement. various nonindustrial sources, such as
the university of tokyo, japan, have also played a role in the development of
 xxxd3284xxx .
nippon shinyaku has licensed the rights to  xxxd3284xxx  from toko pharmaceutical industries for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, according
to nippon shinyaku’s june 2004 pipeline update. however it is unclear when
toko pharmaceutical industries acquired rights to the compound.

1. profile
1.1 pharmacokinetics

two patients with relapse of acute promyelocytic
leukaemia previously treated with all-trans retinoic
acid were treated with oral  xxxd3284xxx , starting at
6 mg/m2/day. during administration of  xxxd3284xxx , serum levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol were increased to 564 mg/dl and 7.8 mmol/
l in patient 1, and 302 mg/dl and 5.67 mmol/l in
patient 2, respectively.[1]
1.2 adverse events

oral formulation: in a study in two patients with
relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia, both developed hyperlipidaemia, and headache occurred in
one shortly after cessation of treatment with
 xxxd3284xxx . both had been previously treated with
all-trans  xxxd3417xxx . the patients received oral
 xxxd3284xxx  starting at 6 mg/m2/day.[1] one of

24 patients developed  xxxd3417xxx  syndrome
(characterised by fever, dyspnoea, low arterial oxygen levels and diffuse opaque pulmonary shadows)
after  xxxd3284xxx  therapy. one patient developed
leucocytosis with a wbc count of 51.2 × 105/l and
three others developed moderate leucocytosis. sixteen patients developed hypertriglyceridaemia and
15 developed hypercholesterolaemia. the adverse
events associated with  xxxd3284xxx  therapy were
generally milder than those experienced by patients
during tretinoin therapy. patients received oral
 xxxd3284xxx  6 mg/m2/day. therapy continued until
complete remission was achieved; the dosage of
 xxxd3284xxx  was increased to 9 mg/m2/day after
2 weeks if a satisfactory response had not been
achieved and decreased to 3 mg/m2/day or discontinued if serious adverse events occurred.[2]
topical
formulation:
 xxxd3284xxx 
0.002–0.008% applied once daily for 5 days was
only found to be irritating to the skin in one of 20
patients with psoriasis vulgaris. that patient re-

preclinical studies: in the assay system involving
chorioallantoic membranes of growing chick embryos,  xxxd3284xxx  was shown to have anti-angiogenic activity. the results suggested that
 xxxd3284xxx  may have potential for the treatment of
angiogenesis-dependent disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis and
solid tumours.[5]

in rats with collagen-induced arthritis,

levels of anti-type ii collagen antibody, whereas
isotretinoin 10–100 mg/kg/day po did not.

1.4 therapeutic trials
1.4.1 cancer

two patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic
leukaemia previously treated with all-trans retinoic
acid, were treated with oral  xxxd3284xxx  starting at
6 mg/m2/day. in both patients, pancytopenia gradually resolved without an increase in leukaemic cells,
and differentiation of leukaemic cells was observed
morphologically in bone marrow. both patients
achieved complete remission on days 52 and 38 of
treatment, respectively, without treatment with other
antileukaemic agents. another case was reported of
two patients with relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia previously treated with all-trans retinoic
acid who achieved complete remission with
 xxxd3284xxx  treatment on days 48 and 22, respectively.[1] fourteen of 24 patients with relapsed acute
promyelocytic leukaemia achieved a complete remission a median of 41 days after the start of
 xxxd3284xxx  therapy. among the 10 patients who

did not achieve a complete remission, three showed
disease progression and seven showed either no
disease progression or some improvement in their
condition. among the patients who achieved complete remission, five went on to receive allogeneic
bone marrow transplantation; they were all still in
complete remission 14 months later. two patients
relapsed and the remaining seven received additional chemotherapy and were still in complete remission 14 months later. all patients had initially
achieved complete remission with tretinoin therapy
± chemotherapy and subsequently relapsed. they
received oral  xxxd3284xxx  6 mg/m2/day. therapy
continued until complete remission was achieved;
the dosage of  xxxd3284xxx  was increased to 9 mg/

not been achieved and decreased to 3 mg/m2/day or
discontinued if serious adverse events occurred.[2]
1.4.2 skin disorders

dosage and administration: the optimum concentration for topical  xxxd3284xxx  applied once daily for 3 weeks was found to be 0.008% in a dosefinding study involving 20 patients with psoriasis
vulgaris.[8]
therapeutic trials: 52.9% of patients with
psoriasis vulgaris ‘markedly remitted’ according to
a global improvement rating of skin condition after
treatment with  xxxd3284xxx  0.008% ointment, com-

pared with 47.1% with 0.005% ointment, 29.4%
with 0.002% ointment, and 18.8% with ointment
base. there were no consistent results with ‘fairly
remitted’ results.[8]
