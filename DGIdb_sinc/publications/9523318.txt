purpose. upon glucocorticoid stimulation, human mononuclear leuco-
cytes express an antigen, rm3/1, which characterizes a subpopulation
of human monocytes and macrophages evolving in late phase of
inflammation. we investigated biochemical properties of the rm3/1
antigen and correlations between antigen expression and glucocorti-
coid potency.

methods. biochemical properties were analyzed after solubilization by
immunoaffinity methods and sds-page.

results. induction of the rm3/1 antigen is a  xxxg1601xxx 
mediated process, in contrast, inflammatory mediators such as lps or
tpa were not able to upregulate rm3/1 expression. after sds-page,
the antigen appeared as a 130 kda (nonreduced)/150 kda (reduced)
glycoprotein with a 25 kda n-linked glycoportion. the interdepen-
dence between antigen density and glucocorticoid efficacy was
assessed by calculation of relative antigen expression induced by dex-
amethasone,  xxxd2145xxx , budesonide, triamcinolone ace-
tonide,  xxxd2126xxx , beclomethasone, prednisolone and triamcinolone.
relative antigen expression was significantly correlated with the rela-
tive receptor affinity of the glucocorticoid.

conclusions. we described biochemical properties of the glucocorti-
coid-induced protein rm3/1. though the precise role of the rm3/1
antigen in the antiinflammatory process is not fully understood yet, an
useful application of the induced expression could already be demon-
strated for pre-clinical screening of glucocorticoid potency.

 

key words: glucocorticoids; rm3/1 antigen; human monocytes;
glycoprotein; receptor affinity.

introduction

glucocorticoids exhibit antiinflammatory and immuno-
suppressive actions by induction or suppression of gene
transcription (1,2). they can inhibit the transcription of  xxxd2315xxx -
matory cytokines (3,4) or initiate the expression of antiinflam-
atory proteins (5~7). there are more proteins or mediators
described which are repressed rather than induced by  xxxd1751xxx -
steroids. yet, those proteins which are expressed upon gluco-
corticoid stimulation might mediate antiinflammatory effects.

research paper

observed glucocorticoid effects vary among different
compounds. high clinical efficacy is generally related to a high
specific binding affinity of the corticosteroid to its receptor and
this is mainly determined by the lipophilicity of the glucocorti-
coid. whether glucocorticoid-induced expression of potentially
antiinflammatory proteins in monocytes also mirrors the
potency of the substance needs to be elucidated.

monocytes and macrophages are an interesting cell sys-
tem to study glucocorticoid effects because they have a key
position in the inflammatory process (8) and in modulation of
responses of the immune system (9). peripheral blood mono-
cytes, which are precursors of tissue macrophages, form a het-
erogeneous population which exerts a great variety of
physiological and pathological functions (10).

we previously described the generation of a monoclonal
antibody (rm3/1) directed against a subpopulation of mono-
cytes in human peripheral blood (11). the antigen is presented
on the surface of 15-30% of freshly isolated monocytes of
healthy donors and is induced by glucocorticoids in vitro. after
48 hrs incubation with dexamethasone more than 90% of the
monocytes express the rm3/1 antigen. injection of glucocorti-
coids into primates (12) or human volunteers (13) resulted in an
increase of rm3/1 positive blood monocytes up to 80% within
6 hrs.

monocytes expressing the rm3/1 antigen are also present
in acute and chronic inflammation. during experimental gin-
givitis (14) and under allergic contact eczema (11) rm3/1
monocytes/macrophages appeared preferentially in the late
inflammatory phase. thus, it was concluded that this subpopu-
lation of monocytes/macrophages could display anti-inflamma-
tory properties. indeed, the secretion of proteins with
anti-inflammatory properties by rm3/1 positive macrophages
were recently described (7,15).

aim of the present study was the biochemical characteri-
zation of the rm3/i antigen and to reveal a possible correlation
between glucocorticoid-induced rm3/1 expression and the
potency of glucocorticoids.

materials and methods

stimulants and radiochemicals

dexamethasone and prednisolone were purchased from
merck (darmstadt, germany), fluticasone-17-propionate,
beclomethasone and ru486 were generous gifts from glaxo
group research (greenford, england), budesonide was pur-
chased from ab draco (lund, sweden), triamcinolone and tri-
amcinolone acetonide from cyanamid (wolfratshausen,
germany).

lps from e. coli (type 055: b5), cycloheximide, actino-
mycine d, pma (12-0-tetradodecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)
and  xxxd3027xxx  were purchased from sigma (deisen-
hofen, germany). radiolabelled 7>h-mannose, *h-glucosamin
and *h-galactose were purchased from amersham (braun-
schweig, germany).

antibodies

the monoclonal antibody rm3/1 was previously gener-
ated and characterized by our group (11). the fitc (floures-

296
monocyte glycoprotein induced by glucocorticoids

cein-isothiocyanat) and alkaline phosphatase-labelled sec-
ondary antibody goat-anti mouse igg, and the control mouse
igg, were purchased from dianova (hamburg, germany).

isolation of blood monocytes

monocytes were isolated from pooled buffy coats (blut-
bank miinster, germany) by  xxxd3253xxx -paque (pharmacia, freiburg,
germany) and subsequent percoll (pharmacia) density gradient
centrifugation. the monocytes purity was >90%. monocytes
were cultured at a density of 2 x 10° cells/ml in hydrophobic
teflon bags (heraeus, hanau, germany) in mccoy’ xxxg1865xxx  medium
(biochrom, berlin, germany) supplemented with 15% fetal calf
serum.

stimulation of monocytes

monocytes for biochemical characterization of the rm3/1
antigen were cultivated for 2 days in presence of 107? m dex-
amethasone or 10-8 m  xxxd2145xxx . stimulation with
lps was performed for 1 day at a concentration of 1 ug/ml,
stimulation with cycloheximide and actinomycine d for 16 hrs
at a concentration of 2 ug/ml and 0.75 ug/ml, respectively,
stimulation with pma for 1 hr at a concentration of 0.3 ng/ml.

facs-analysis

for indirect immunofluorescence analysis, monocytes
were washed with cold phosphate buffered saline (pbs, ph
7.4) and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumine (bsa) for
30 min at 4°c. then cells were washed and incubated with opti-
mal antibody concentration (5-10 [g/ml) for 45 min at 4°c.
mouse igg, was included as isotype control. subsequently,
monocytes were washed with pbs and incubated with fitc-
labeled secondary antibody goat-anti mouse igg, in 1% bsa
for 30 min at 4°c.  xxxd3027xxx  (1mm in pbs) was added
for the last 2 min of incubation to determine cell viability and
exclusion of dead cells. the fluorescence intensity of 10* vital
cells was measured by facs (fluorescence activated cell
sorter)-analysis (facscan, becton dickinson, heidelberg,
germany). the parameters used were 488 nm excitation wave-
length, 250 mw and logarithmic amplification. the antigen
density and the number of rm3/1 positive cells corrected for
isotype control were obtained from the main fluorescence chan-
nel at 510-530 nm using lysis software (becton dickinson).

isolation of the rm3/1 antigen

cell lysis was performed by nitrogen decompression after
20 min (30 bar at 4°c). after centrifugation to separate cell
nuclei, cell membrane pellet was solubilized in 0.5% triton x-
114 containing 1 mm pmsf for 15 min at 4°c, after 30 min at
37°c phase separation occured (16) and the lower, detergent-
rich phase containing hydrophobic membrane proteins was col-
lected.

alternatively, in later experiments, cells were lysed and
solubilized in a one-step procedure. monocytes were incubated
with 1-10 mm  xxxd502xxx ™ (boehringer mannheim,
germany) and octylthioglucopyranoside (sigma) at a protein
detergent ratio of 0.2 for 30 min at room temperature under gen-
tle rotation. after centrifugation the supernatant was collected.

297

immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography

the detergent-rich phase was incubated for 1 hr at room
temperature with 100 ug rabbit igg (pierce, sankt augustin,
germany) to block nonspecific binding to igg antibodies.
rabbit igg was removed by incubation with 30 ul [gg-binding
protein g sepharose (protein g sepharose fast flow, pharmacia
lkb, freiburg, germany) for 1 hr at room temperature. protein
g sepharose was removed by centrifugation and supernatant
was incubated with rm3/1 antibody for 16 hrs at 4°c under
gentle shaking. subsequently, 30 pl protein g sepharose was
added and samples were incubated for another 1 hr at room tem-
perature. the incubation mixture was pelleted and the pellet was
washed twice with pbs containing 0.5% (v/v) nonidet p-40
(sigma) and twice with pbs. the pellet was used for sds-
page. for affinity chromatography, 1 mg of rm3/1 antibody
was coupled to cyanbromide activated sepharose (pharmacia
lkb) according to manufacturer’s protocol. after incubation
with a crude cell extract, rm3/1 antigen was eluted from the
affinity column with 0.2 m glycine-hcl, ph 2.5. the eluate was
immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m tris (ph 8.5).

sds-page (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)

proteins were separated by sds-page under reducing
conditions according to laemmli (17) using a 8% running gel.
for nonreducing conditions,  xxxd26xxx  or dtt (both
sigma) were omitted. protein bands were either stained with
0.1% coomassie blue (r 250, sigma) or with silver staining
according to manufacturer’s protocol (sigma).

deglycosylation

detergent-rich phase was prepurified by gel filtration chro-
matography with a sephadex g25 (pharmacia lkb) column
(70 cm length, inner diameter 3 cm). proteins were eluted with
0.2 m ammonia acetate solution (ph 7.3). protein containing
fractions were concentrated by lyophilization and reconstituted
in incubation buffer for glycosidases. reaction volume for all
incubations with glycosidases was 100 ul, 0.02 % sodium azide
was included in all reaction mixtures. for deglycosylation with
n-glycosidase (pngase f, boehringer mannheim), 50 ul pro-
tein extract was denatured by heating for 2 min at 100°c with 40
mm phosphate buffer ph 7.5, 0.1 m edta, 5% mercapto-
ethanol and 0.5% sds (all sigma). subsequently, 1.25% of
octylthioglucosid and 5 u n-glycosidase was added to result in
a final volume of 100 ul. for deglycosylation with o-glycosi-
dase (boehringer mannheim), protein extract was incubated
with 0.1 m sodium citrate/phosphate buffer ph 6.0, 100 pg/ml
bsa and 5 mu o-glycosidase. for deglycosylation with siali-
dase (neuraminidase, boehringer mannheim), protein extract
was incubated with 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer ph 5.0 and
0.2 u sialidase. incubations were carried out at 37°c for 16 hrs.
reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of sam-
ple buffer and heating at 95 °c for 5 min. shift in protein bands
were detected by sds-page and coomassie staining.

metabolic labelling with 7h-monosaccharides

samples of 108 monocytes were incubated in 50 ml
medium containing dexamethasone (10-? m) and each 250 pci
298

3h-mannose, *h-glucosamin and *h-galactose overnight at
37°c. cells were washed, lysed and immunoprecipitated. after
sds-page radioactive proteins were detected by autoradio-

graphy.
results
characterization of the rm3/1 antigen

the monocyte surface epitope which is recognized by the
rm3/1 antibody was assumed to have protein character. to
demonstrate that rm3/1 expression is dependent on protein
synthesis,  xxxd1800xxx  d—an inhibitor of rna polymerase—
and cycloheximide—an inhibitor of translocation at eucaryotic
ribosomes—were incubated with monocytes and rm3/1 anti-
gen density of 10‘ vital cells was quantified by facscan analy-
sis, corrected for isotype control (figure 1). both inhibitors of
protein synthesis reduced rm3/1 antigen expression statisti-
cally significantly (paired t-test, p < 0.05).

after solubilization of equal numbers of glucocorticoid
stimulated and nonstimulated monocytes and sds-page of
the crude cell extract, a complex pattern of multiple proteins
with molecular weights smaller than 120 kda could be seen
(figure 2, lane 2: nonstimulated, lane 3: stimulated cells). few
proteins with molecular weights higher than 120 kda could be
identified on the gel, two prominent bands at approximately
150 (see arrow) and 170 kda which are less expressed in the
nonstimulated cells, can be found in the cell extract of stimu-
lated monocytes. after prepurification of the crude cell extract
via sephadex g25 gel filtration chromatography (lane 4: non-
stimulated, lane 5: glucocorticoid stimulated monocytes) the

mark the migration distance of the rm3/1 antigen under reducing
(150 kda) and nonreducing (130 kda) conditions. monocytes were
stimulated with 10-° m  xxxd2145xxx .

pattern of bands changed only slightly, a high molecular weight
protein at 220 kda is absent after this preparation. affinity
chromatography of the crude cell extract (lane 6: nonstimu-
lated, lane 7: stimulated cells) revealed that the band at 150 kda
(arrow) is bound by the rm3/1 antibody. the protein at 220 kda
is bound nonspecifically by the antibody which could be
seen with control mouse igg, affinity chromatography (not
shown). the protein eluate from the affinity column was also
chromatographed under nonreducing conditions (lane 8). a
shift in the molecular weight was observed, in the absence of
reducing agents the protein had an apparent molecular weight
of 125 kda.

to confirm that the prominent band around 150 kda was
affiliated to a single protein, a two-dimensional electrophoresis
was performed. the 150 kda band was found to be a single pro-
tein with an ip of 5.5 (data not shown).

posttranslational modification of membrane proteins are a
common, most often they are n-glycosylated. thus, the rm3/1
antigen was analyzed for putative glycoportions (figure 3).
therefore, the rm3/1 antigen was deglycosylated by incuba-
tion with n- and o-glycosidase (lanes 3 and 4) and sialidase
(lane 5). after sds-page, a band shift of 25-30 kda was
detectable after incubation with n-glycosidase (arrow) com-
pared to control (lane 2, arrow), whereas o-glycosidase did not
cause any shifts. incubation with sialidase caused a very slight
shift so that the presence of some sialylated carbohydrates can-
not be totally excluded. incubation of the monocyte extract
with combinations of o-glycosidase and sialidase (lane 6) or n-
and o-glycosidase and sialidase (lane 7) resulted in no further
shifts. metabolic labelling with *h-mannose, 7h-glucosamine
and *h-galactose was performed to verify the presence of a gly-
can structure in the rm3/1 antigen. after incubation of the
monocytes with a mixture of 7h-mannose, *h-glucosamine and

3h-galactose, the rm3/1 antigen was solubilized and immuno-
precipitated. sds-page revealed bands after immunoprecipita-
tion with the rm3/1 antibody, but not with control mouse igg,
antibody (figure 4). no bands were detectable after immuno-
precipitation with the rm3/1 antibody in the culture super-
natant (lane 1). in the contrary, clear bands were seen after
immunoprecipitation with the rm3/1 antibody of lysed mono-
cytes after nitrogen decompression (lane 2) or triton x-114
solubilization (lane 3).

induction of the rm3/1 antigen

the rm3/i antigen expression was inducible by glucocor-
ticoids. time course of early surface expression on human
monocytes was determined by indirect fluorescence analysis
(figure 6). number of positive monocytes and antigen density
increased significantly after 16 hrs. the antigen density and the
number of positive cells always showed a high correlation with
a coefficient of correlation of r = 0.974. optimal dexametha-
sone concentration for stimulation was 10-7 m (data not
shown).

to confirm that the rm3/1 induction is a glucocorticoid
receptor-related effect, monocytes were coincubated with the
glucocorticoid antagonist, ru486 and dexamethasone (figure
5). control monocytes exhibited a statistically significant
increase in antigen density after stimulation with 10-’ m dex-
amethasone. when the glucocorticoid antagonist ru486 was
added to the culture medium at a concentration of 10 m, a
clear inhibition of the rm3/1 expression resulted, again statis-
tically significant versus stimulated control. at equimolar con-
centrations of agonist and antagonist we observed a slight, but

nist overcomes antagonistic effects and there is no difference to
stimulated control cells. significance of treatment effects was
calculated with one-factorial anova and subsequent fisher
plsd test.

the influence of inflammatory activators—compared to
the influence of the antiinflammatory glucocorticoids—on
rm3/1 antigen expression was determined by incubation of
pma and lps with monocytes. after pma treatment the num-
ber of positive cells was statistically significantly reduced
(paired t-test, p < 0.05) whereas lps had no effect on rm3/1
expression compared to nontreated control cells (figure 7).

correlation of rm3/1 antigen induction and relative
receptor affinity of glucocorticoids

for determination of antigen expression peripheral blood
monocytes were incubated for one day with nine different glu-
cocorticoids with known relative receptor affinity (rra)
(18-20). various concentrations were used for each glucocorti-
coid, antigen expression was evaluated by facscan analysis.

results of relative antigen expression are given in table i.
three series of experiments were performed and, although
rae varies in terms of absolute values, rank order of glucocor-

r= 0.995 and r = 0.989, respectively.

discussion

the rm3/1 antigen is a membrane glycoprotein found on
human monocytes and macrophages. it is constitutively present
on 15-30% of circulating blood monocytes (11) and it is sig-
nificantly induced by glucocorticoids. the rm3/1 expression is
dependent on protein synthesis as we could demonstrate with
inhibition experiments with  xxxd1800xxx  d and cycloheximide.

the rm3/1 protein could be solubilized with nonionic
detergents which is typical for integral membrane proteins.
sds-page revealed an apparent molecular weight of about
130 kda (unreduced) and 150 kda (reduced conditions). this
migration behavior suggests the presence of several intramole-
cular disulfide bonds. the intrachain disulfide bonds might
retain the protein in a more compact configuration which can
migrate faster electrophoretically (22).

the rm3/1 antigen is extensively glycosylated posttrans-
lationally, about 17% of the molecular weight are contributed by
the oligosaccharide. the glycoportion consists predominantly of
n-glycans, however, presence of sialic acids cannot be
excluded. glycoproteins which are n-glycosylated have a com-
mon core structure consisting of b- xxxd2589xxx -acetylgalactosamin-

(1 —> 4)-b-d-acetylgalactosamin-(1 — 4)-b-d-mannose-(1 — 6)
and (1 — 3)-a-d-mannose (23). this core structure is further
modified with additional mannose carbohydrates to result in
high mannose-type oligosaccharides, with additional mannose,
n- xxxd2683xxx , galactose and sialic acid residues to result
in hybrid-type oligosaccharides or with n- xxxd2683xxx ,
galactose and sialic acid residues to result in complex-type
oligosaccharides. metabolic labelling revealed that at least the
monosaccharides mannose, galactose and glucosamine are com-
ponents of the glycoportion, thus supporting the presence of the
n-glycan core structure in the rm3/1 antigen. antigen density
and number of rm3/1 positive cells manifested that early
expression starts after 16 hrs. previous time course studies
showed that the peak expression of the rm3/1 antigen is after
about 2-3 days in culture (11). the early expression kinetics are
typical for glucocorticoid-induced effects at the molecular level.
glucocorticoid-induced up-regulation of il-6 receptors on
endothelial cells peaked after 15 hrs (24). clear cut effects in up-
regulation of gm-csf receptor expression on monocytes
induced by glucocorticoids was seen after 3 days (25). however,
induction of rna synthesis by glucocorticoids may occur fast,
within 4 hrs (26).

it could be now demonstrated that the induction of the
expression is a  xxxg1601xxx -mediated mechanism
which could be inhibited by the glucocorticoid antagonist,
ru486. the observation that 15-30% of human monocytes
are rm3/1 positive without stimulation could thus be the
result of endogenous stimulation by hydrocortisone. there is
obviously a close relationship of rm3/1 expression and the
antiinflammatory process (8,13,14). these previous observa-
tions are underlined by the finding that the appearance of the
rm3/1 antigen is not related to the activation process of mono-
cytes/ macrophages: pma downregulated the rm3/1 antigen
and bacterial lps was lacking an effect on rm3/1 antigen
expression.

recently, a contribution of this antigen in the adhesion
process of monocytes to activated endothelial cells was shown
(27). the now described characteristics of this glycoprotein,
carrying a substantial n-glycan portion, supports the notice that
it is involved in the adhesion process since adhesion is often
mediated by n-glycosylated proteins (28,29). the precise func-
tion of the rm3/1 membrane protein is still under investigation.
however, the expression of this antigen was already found to
be a very useful model system for testing synthetic glucocorti-
coids. clinical glucocorticoid effects vary among different
compounds, which can be mainly ascribed to the specific bind-
ing affinity of the corticosteroid to its receptor. relative recep-
tor affinity of glucocorticoids can be evaluated from in vitro
binding tests with receptor containing cytosol (20,30,31).
experiments for determination of rras are usually performed
with isolated and stabilized cytosolic receptors. neither the glu-
cocorticoid diffusion into the cell is part of the rra calculation
nor the time to initiate a dna downstream effect. a conven-
tional clinical approach for glucocorticoid screening is the skin
blanching test (32). several factors besides the glucocorticoid
affinity to its receptor influence the outcome of this approach
such as the type of vehicle used, the status of the skin or the
absorption rate. thus, this test system evaluates both pharma-
cokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a corticosteroid.
this is valuable for assessment of glucocorticoids meant for
dermal application, but may be misleading for mucous mem-
branes in case of nasal or pulmonary application where a pro-
nounced resorption phase is absent. for these types of
application the rm3/1 model system is much more suitable
because it mirrors pharmacodynamic glucocorticoid effects
without preceeding pharmacokinetic events. now, it could be
shown that rm3/1 glycoprotein expression is dependent on
glucocorticoid concentration and also highly correlated to the
relative affinity (rra) of the glucocorticoid to its receptor.
consequently, the very potent  xxxd2145xxx  induced.
antigen expression at very low concentrations, whereas pred-
nisolone influenced protein expression if present at high con-
centrations only. it has to be notified that only the poorly active
beclomethasone, but not beclomethasone-17, 21-dipropionate
(bdp, rra 53) or its potent metabolite beclomethasone-17-
monopropionate (17-bmp, rra 1345), were tested because
bdp and 17-bmp were not stable under incubation conditions
and the addition of an esterase inhibitor was lethal for the
monocytes. although the results of single relative protein
expression experiments varied up to 2-fold, the resulting rank-
ing of the glucocorticoids was highly reproducible. this rank-
ing, also shown by the rra experiments, is also found for
clinical efficacy of these corticosteroids (33).

therefore, the rm3/1 expression may be a useful in vitro
model to screen the potency of glucocorticoids, or to evaluate
antagonistic effects. using glucocorticoid-induced protein
expression in monocytes as a natural model system, the gluco-
corticoid uptake as well as the effect of the glucocorticoid-
receptor interaction—the production of the potentially
antiinflammatory rm3/1 glycoprotein—can be measured. this
system has even advantages over analogous methods which
could be used, such as monitoring the reduced secretion of
inflammatory mediators upon glucocorticoid addition. with the
rm3/1 system it is not necessary to stimulate the monocytes
first with inflammatory agents like lps to measure a subsequent
302

glucocorticoid effect since the rm3/1 is directly induced by glu-
cocorticoids. the rm3/1 antigen—as a membrane protein—can
be measured easily by antibody labelling and subsequent
facscan analysis. thus, this test system mimics parts of gluco-
corticoid action in vivo and is suitable for preclinical screening.
