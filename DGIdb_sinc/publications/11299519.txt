mutations in the folliclestimulating hormone-beta (fsh)
and  xxxg815xxx  genes in mice
and humans
lawrence c. layman, m.d.

abstract—follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), a dimeric glycoprotein synthesized in the
anterior pituitary gland, is important for the production of sex steroids and gametes. fshbeta (fsh) and  xxxg815xxx  ( xxxg815xxx ) knockout mice display impaired ovarian follicular
development and infertility in females and small testes, oligospermia, and fertility in males.
humans with fsh gene mutations tend to have a more severe phenotype than those with
 xxxg815xxx  gene mutations, although infertility and varying degrees of impaired sex steroid production occur in both types of mutations. data from human and mouse mutations in the
fsh and  xxxg815xxx  genes suggest that fsh is necessary for normal pubertal development and
fertility in males and females.

fsh structure and proposed
mechanism of action in the
ovary and testis
the pituitary gonadotropin follicle-stimulating
hormone (fsh) is a dimeric glycoprotein that interacts with its membrane-bound receptor to produce
biologic effects. following binding to the  xxxg815xxx  ( xxxg815xxx ), a heptahelical g protein–coupled

receptor, intracellular events are initiated that include the production of second messenger cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  (camp).1 subsequently,
 xxxg1836xxx  is produced and stimulates phosphorylation of proteins that mediate fsh events.1
well-accepted functions of fsh include ovarian follicular development and estradiol production in females and the regulation of sertoli cell action and
probably spermatogenesis in males. fsh is essen-

animal models of fsh deficiency:
fsh and  xxxg815xxx  knockout mice
fsh knockout mice demonstrate low levels
of fsh with sterility in females but fertility
in males
the creation of the fsh knockout mouse provided an in vivo model with which to study endocrinologic and reproductive effects of deficient
fsh (table 1).2 female homozygous fsh knockout mice, as expected, had low serum fsh levels
and were sterile because of impaired ovarian follicular development.2 upon histologic examination of the ovary, most follicles were primordial or
primary, although occasional degenerating antral
follicles were observed. serum estradiol was normal in these mice despite unmeasurable serum
fsh levels, which is somewhat surprising because
fsh is the principal stimulating factor of estradiol
secretion. male homozygous fsh knockout mice
had normal levels of serum testosterone but had
small testes and oligospermia. these male mice
demonstrated fertility, suggesting that fsh is not
absolutely essential for fertility.2 the endocrinologic and reproductive deficits of the fsh knockout mice were completely reversed by introducing
the human wild-type fsh transgene into the
fsh-deficient background of the homozygous
fsh knockout mouse.3

 xxxg815xxx  knockout mice exhibit elevated levels
of fsh with sterility in females and reduced
fertility in males
targeted knockout of the mouse  xxxg815xxx  produces
a phenotype similar to that of the fsh knockout
mouse (table 1) except that serum fsh levels are
elevated.4 homozygous female  xxxg815xxx  knockout
mice had normal estradiol levels, immature follicles (primordial, primary, secondary), and sterility,
and homozygous male  xxxg815xxx  knockout mice had
decreased testicular size, low testosterone, and
oligospermia. like the fsh knockout male, the
 xxxg815xxx  knockout male was fertile, although fertility
was impaired and testosterone was low.

human models of fsh deficiency:
fsh and  xxxg815xxx  mutations
 xxxd2285xxx  gene mutations cause low
levels of fsh, hypogonadism, and sterility
in both sexes
naturally occurring fsh mutations have been
described in a small number of humans with isolated fsh deficiency (tables 2 and 3).5–9 three reported females with fsh gene mutations presented with absent breast development, low fsh
and estradiol, high  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  (lh), and
sterility (table 2).5,6,8 one patient (with a val61x
mutation) had primordial and primary follicles
upon ovarian biopsy and conceived after she was
treated with exogenous fsh.5 these investigators
predicted that the 2-base-pair (bp) frameshift deletion (val61x) would change amino acids 61 to 86,

this mutation was predicted to interfere with
dimer formation and receptor binding, although no
in vitro studies were performed to support their
hypothesis. the first well-characterized case of isolated fsh deficiency, a female described in the
early 1970s, was also later found to have the same
2-bp deletion (val61x).8
one of the females with fsh deficiency and pubertal delay demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys51gly missense mutation inherited
from her father and the previously described
val61x mutation inherited from her mother (fig.
1).6 in vitro analysis confirmed the presumptive effects of these mutations on fsh function. both mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis,
cloned into a vector containing both the -subunit
and fsh, and stably transfected into chinese
hamster ovary (cho) cells, and the medium was
assayed for both immuno-fsh (i-fsh) and bioactive fsh (b-fsh) levels. measurable i-fsh and bfsh were observed for the wild-type fsh gene,
but both i-fsh and b-fsh were completely absent
for both the cys51gly and val61x mutations. although the precise mechanism was not determined, it is likely that dimer formation and secretion were both impaired.6

this patient with compound heterozygous fsh
mutations provided some interesting information
about fsh action in humans. the proband had absent puberty, undetectable fsh, elevated lh levels
(30 to 40 miu/ml), and antral follicles on ultrasonography. when gonadotropins were measured
every 10 minutes overnight, fsh was undetectable
and mean lh levels were 46 miu/ml with
nine pulses in 11 hours (pulse amplitude of
15 miu/ml).10 this pattern of elevated lh/fsh
ratio is reminiscent of that for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos), but testosterone
was in the low normal range (15 to 25 ng/dl) in the
proband with isolated fsh deficiency in contrast to
women with pcos. these findings suggested that
fsh might be necessary for normal lh-induced
androgen production by the theca cells.
to investigate the effect of fsh on androgen production, the proband had oral contraceptives discontinued for 1 month. she was given human
 xxxd2228xxx  (hcg) alone, and 1 month
later fsh and then hcg 24 hours later.11 steroid intermediates and androgens were measured before
and after each dose of gonadotropin. when only
hcg was administered, steroid intermediates increased but testosterone levels were not elevated.
in the following month when fsh was administered, estradiol and inhibin b levels increased as ex-

these findings provide further support to the idea
that the two-cell, two-gonadotropin theory is perhaps too simplistic to explain ovarian steroid production. fsh appears to be necessary for normal
thecal androgen production, suggesting that fsh
induces certain growth factors, inhibin b, or lhdependent enzymes such as  xxxg573xxx .
two different fsh gene mutations have been
identified in males with isolated fsh deficiency
(table 3). the first male with a cys82arg missense
mutation (not analyzed in vitro) had normal puberty but was azoospermic, a predictable phenotype for fsh gene mutations.7 surprisingly, a
male homozygous for the previously described
val61x nonsense mutation had no evidence of puberty, low testosterone, small testes, and azoospermia.9 contrary to the observations from the knockout mice, these findings suggested that fsh was
essential for spermatogenesis in human males, and
if the mutation was severe, androgen production,

mutations in the fsh and  xxxg815xxx  genes—layman

knockout mice and human gene
mutations: similarities
and differences
although the phenotypes of mouse and human
fsh and  xxxg815xxx  gene mutations are similar, certain
differences also exist. female fsh and  xxxg815xxx 
knockout mice exhibit sterility with defects in ovarian follicular development,2 as do humans with
fsh gene mutations.5,6,8 however, these mice
have normal levels of estradiol,2 whereas humans

uniformly have low, menopausal levels.5,6,8 fsh
knockout mice have primordial and primary follicles with an occasional degenerating antral
follicle.2  xxxg815xxx  knockout mice have primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. two human females
had only primordial and primary follicles, and another had evidence of multiple antral follicles on
ultrasonography.
perhaps the most striking differences are seen in
males. fsh and  xxxg815xxx  knockout mice have
oligospermia and fertility,2 whereas both human
fsh-deficient males have azoospermia and sterility (confirmed by molecular analysis).7,9 there have
been no studies examining the prevalence of fsh
gene mutations in oligospermic males, although
the gene is a likely candidate for this condition on
the basis of the evidence presented. in addition, depending on the severity of the mutation, puberty
may be completely absent or normal in human
males with fsh gene mutations.7,9 the observation that an fsh-deficient male had deficient testosterone levels, as did male homozygous  xxxg815xxx 
knockout mice, suggests that fsh may have a role
in lh-mediated androgen production.

mary amenorrhea, elevated gonadotropins, and
antral follicles on ultrasonography had compound
heterozygous  xxxg815xxx  mutations.17 the asp224val in
the extracellular domain inhibited ligand binding,
whereas the leu601val in the third extracellular
loop affected signal transduction but not binding.17
the prevalence of  xxxg815xxx  gene mutations has been
addressed in several studies. the finnish mutation
(ala189val) is common in finland (1% of females
are heterozygotes)12,18 but was seen in only 1 in
1200 in switzerland, 0 in 1100 in denmark, and 0 in
540 in singapore.18 when studied in women with
premature ovarian failure, the finnish allele was
not identified in any north american females with
premature ovarian failure (n = 35).19 several  xxxg815xxx 
polymorphisms have also been identified but have
not been demonstrated to cause hypergonadotropic hypogonadism20,21 or pcos21 in humans.
to date, one inactivating  xxxg815xxx  gene mutation
(finnish ala189val mutation) has been identified in
males (table 3). pubertal development and testosterone levels are normal, but the testes are small
and there is a wide range of sperm concentrations,
from less than 1 to greater than 20 million/ml (normal defined as  20 million/ml).14 in general,
the phenotypic effects of  xxxg815xxx  gene mutations do
not seem to be as severe as those of the ligand
-subunit. the functional studies of the finnish
mutations support these findings, because the mutant receptors have normal binding affinity and are
merely decreased in number.12 thus, an elevated
fsh level may be able to compensate partly for impaired receptor function. several polymorphisms
have also been identified in males, but they were
present in both fertile and infertile men.22
one activating  xxxg815xxx  mutation has been reported in a male who underwent a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for a pituitary adenoma
but who maintained normal semen parameters despite low gonadotropins postoperatively.15 he had
an asp567gly missense mutation that increased
camp 1.5-fold. unfortunately, no family members
were available, so the inheritance of this mutant,
constitutively active  xxxg815xxx  could not be determined.

conclusions
mouse knockouts and human mutations for
fsh and the  xxxg815xxx  support the following potential actions of fsh in pubertal development and reproduction. in females, fsh is necessary for follicular development beyond the antral stage, estradiol
production, normal puberty, and fertility. in males,
fsh is required for testicular development and
normal concentrations of sperm, but it may also be
important for normal androgen production and puberty. however, it remains to be determined why
estradiol levels are low in the fsh and  xxxg815xxx 
knockout mice and why male knockout mice are
fertile but humans are azoospermic. future studies
are needed to address these differences, which
could be species specific or dependent on the severity of the mutant peptide.
