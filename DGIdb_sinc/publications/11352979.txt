secretion of hepatocyte apob is inhibited by the flavonoids, naringenin and  xxxd2272xxx , via reduced activity and expression of  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx  and mtp.  the citrus flavonoids, naringenin and  xxxd2272xxx , lower plasma cholesterol in vivo. however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. the ability of these flavonoids to modulate  xxxg175xxx  (apob) secretion and cellular cholesterol homeostasis was determined in the human hepatoma cell line, hepg2. apob accumulation in the media decreased in a dose-dependent manner following 24-h incubations with naringenin (up to 82%, p < 0.00001) or  xxxd2272xxx  (up to 74%, p < 0.002). decreased apob secretion was associated with reduced cellular cholesteryl ester mass. cholesterol esterification was decreased, dose-dependently, up to 84% (p < 0.0001) at flavonoid concentrations of 200 microm. neither flavonoid demonstrated selective inhibition of either form of acyl coa:cholesterol acyltransferase ( xxxg2184xxx ) as determined using cho cells stably transfected with either  xxxg2184xxx  or  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx . however, in hepg2 cells,  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx  mrna was selectively decreased (- 50%, p < 0.001) by both flavonoids, whereas  xxxg2184xxx  mrna was unaffected. in addition, naringenin and  xxxd2272xxx  decreased both the activity (- 20% to - 40%, p < 0.00004) and expression (- 30% to - 40%, p < 0.02) of  xxxg1481xxx  (mtp). both flavonoids caused a 5- to 7-fold increase (p < 0.02) in low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor mrna, which resulted in a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in uptake and degradation of (125)i-ldl. we conclude that both naringenin and  xxxd2272xxx  decrease the availability of lipids for assembly of apob-containing lipoproteins, an effect mediated by 1) reduced activities of  xxxg2184xxx  and  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx , 2) a selective decrease in  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx  expression, and 3) reduced mtp activity. together with an enhanced expression of the  xxxg1318xxx , these mechanisms may explain the hypocholesterolemic properties of the citrus flavonoids.
