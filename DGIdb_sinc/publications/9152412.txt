 xxxd1903xxx  production dependent upon  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  and its contradictory modulation by  xxxd248xxx  in rat peritoneal ma...  rat peritoneal macrophages were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide or dexamethasone to inhibit the induction of cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 protein synthesis. thereafter, when the macrophages were incubated in the presence of  xxxd208xxx , pge2 production was increased. western blot analysis demonstrated that cox-2 protein levels were low and were not affected by  xxxd208xxx  treatment. cox-1 protein levels were not affected by  xxxd208xxx  treatment either. the cox-2 inhibitors ns-398 and  xxxd2727xxx  only slightly inhibited pge2 production, whereas the cox-1/cox-2 inhibitors indomethacin,  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd3311xxx  strongly inhibited pge2 production. this suggests that under these conditions, pge2 production is dependent on cox-1. after the macrophages were treated with aspirin to inactivate existing cox-1 and cox-2, however, treatment with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate increased pge2 production. furthermore, cox-2 protein levels were markedly increased by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment, whereas cox-1 protein levels did not change. in this case, both the cox-2 and the cox-1/ cox-2 inhibitors inhibited pge2 production. this suggest that under these conditions, pge2 production is dependent on cox-2. effects of  xxxd248xxx  on cox-1-dependent and cox-2-dependent pge2 production were examined. we found that  xxxd248xxx  stimulated cox-1-dependent pge2 production but inhibited cox-2-dependent pge2 production in a concentration-dependent manner. the latter effect was found to be due to the inhibition of cox-2 protein induction. these findings might explain the mechanism of the antirheumatic and anti-inflammatory activities of  xxxd248xxx .
