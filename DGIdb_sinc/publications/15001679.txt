application of mri-based partial-volume correction to the analysis of pet images of mu-opioid receptors using statistical parametric mapping.  the accurate quantification of brain radioactivity concentration is limited by the spatial resolution of the pet scanner for structures smaller than 2-3 times the resolution. in the presence of enlarged cerebrospinal fluid spaces or regions of cortical neuronal loss, a significant underestimation of gray-matter radioactivity concentration due to the resulting partial-volume averaging can potentially occur. to recover the true radioactivity concentration from pet data, algorithms that use the high-resolution anatomic information provided by mri have been developed. their effect on pet quantification has been assessed using regions of interest and non-operator-dependent voxel-based analyses such as statistical parametric mapping (spm), although the mechanisms that lead to an improvement in pet quantification after partial-volume correction (pvc), compared with no pvc, have not been addressed.
