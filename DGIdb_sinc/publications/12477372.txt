summary
abstract

 xxxd3314xxx , an orally and topically active antimycotic agent, inhibits the biosynthesis of the principal sterol in
fungi, ergosterol, at the level of  xxxg2197xxx .  xxxg2197xxx  inhibition results in ergosterol-depleted
fungal cell membranes (fungistatic effect) and the toxic accumulation of intracellular squalene (fungicidal
effect).  xxxd3314xxx  has demonstrated excellent fungicidal activity against the dermatophytes and variable activity against yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds in vitro.
following oral administration,  xxxd3314xxx  is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed to body tissues including the poorly perfused nail matrix. nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations are detected within 1 week after starting
therapy and persist for at least 30 weeks after the completion of treatment.
randomized, double-blind trials showed oral  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day for 12 or 16 weeks was more efficacious
than itraconazole, fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx  in dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toenails. in particular,
at 72 weeks’ follow-up, the multicenter, multinational, l.i.on. (lamisil® vs itraconazole in onychomycosis)
study found that mycologic cure rates (76 vs 38% of patients after 12 weeks’ treatment; 81 vs 49% of recipients
after 16 weeks’ therapy) and complete cure rates were approximately twice as high after  xxxd3314xxx  treatment
than after itraconazole (3 or 4 cycles of 400 mg/day for 1 week repeated every 4 weeks) in patients with toenail
mycosis. furthermore, the l.i.on. icelandic extension study demonstrated that  xxxd3314xxx  was more clinically
effective than intermittent itraconazole to a statistically significant extent at 5-year follow-up.  xxxd3314xxx 
produced a superior complete cure rate (35 vs 14%), mycologic cure rate (46 vs 13%) and clinical cure rate (42
vs 18%) to that of itraconazole. the mycologic and clinical relapse rates were 23% and 21% in the  xxxd3314xxx 
group, respectively, compared with 53% and 48% in the itraconazole group.
in comparative clinical trials, oral  xxxd3314xxx  had a better tolerability profile than  xxxd2235xxx  and a comparable profile to that of itraconazole or fluconazole. post marketing surveillance confirmed  xxxd3314xxx ’s good
tolerability profile. adverse events were experienced by 10.5% of  xxxd3314xxx  recipients, with gastrointestinal
complaints being the most common. unlike the azoles,  xxxd3314xxx  has a low potential for drug-drug interactions.
most pharmacoeconomic evaluations have shown that the greater clinical effectiveness of oral  xxxd3314xxx 
in dermatophyte onychomycosis translates into a cost-effectiveness ratio superior to that of itraconazole,
fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx .
conclusion: oral  xxxd3314xxx  has demonstrated greater effectiveness than itraconazole, fluconazole and
 xxxd2235xxx  in randomized trials involving patients with onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. the drug
is generally well tolerated and has a low potential for drug interactions. therefore,  xxxd3314xxx  is the treatment
of choice for dermatophyte onychomycosis.

pharmacodynamic
properties

 xxxd3314xxx  is an orally and topically active, synthetic, allylamine, which passively diffuses into the poorly
perfused target tissues of the nail matrix.  xxxd3314xxx  inhibits the biosynthesis of the principal sterol in fungi,
ergosterol, at the level of  xxxg2197xxx .  xxxg2197xxx  inhibition results in ergosterol-depleted fungal
cell membranes (fungistatic effect) and the toxic accumulation of intracellular squalene (fungicidal effect).
 xxxd3314xxx  is selectively toxic because fungal  xxxg2197xxx  is at least 1000 times more sensitive than the
mammalian counterpart.
there have been a few case reports of resistance to  xxxd3314xxx  in clinical isolates of dermatophytes, although
the incidence of these remains rare. in addition, several candida albicans isolates have shown reduced susceptibility to  xxxd3314xxx  that may be caused by an over-expression of multidrug efflux transporter genes.
despite the use of many in vitro techniques,  xxxd3314xxx  has consistently produced excellent in vitro activity
against a wide range of dermatophytes with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values typically ranging
from 0.0015 to 0.01 mg/l (112 isolates).  xxxd3314xxx  exhibited a primarily fungicidal effect on 39 dermatophytes
with a geometric mean mic and minimum fungicidal concentration value of 0.004 mg/l (mic range 0.003 to
0.006 mg/l).
 xxxd3314xxx  exhibited potent activity against a range of dermatophyte species but the drug had higher and
more variable mics against pathogenic yeasts.  xxxd3314xxx  activity was measured against yeasts derived from
350 fresh clinical isolates from north and south america using the approved national committee for clinical
and laboratory standards broth macrodilution assay.  xxxd3314xxx  mic50 and mic90 values against 259 isolates
of c. albicans were 1.0 and 4.0 mg/l, respectively (mic range 0.03 to 128 mg/l). although 16 isolates had
 xxxd3314xxx  mics higher than 8 mg/l, 90% of mics were within a 0.25 to 4 mg/l range.
the mic ranges of  xxxd3314xxx  against a range of non-dermatophyte molds were as follows: scytalidium
dimidiatum, 0.06 to 0.12 mg/l; s. hyalinum, 0.25 mg/l; scopulariopsis brevicaulis, 0.5 to 2.0 mg/l; acremonium spp., 0.25 to 8.0 mg/l; and aspergillus spp., 0.03 to 0.25 mg/l.

pharmacokinetic
properties

in healthy volunteers and patients with onychomycosis, oral  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day) exhibits predictable
pharmacokinetics that can be described by a three-compartment model. a single dose of  xxxd3314xxx  250mg
achieves peak plasma concentrations (cmax) of ≈0.8 to 1.5 mg/l within 1.3 to 2 hours (tmax). the concomitant
intake of food delayed tmax and slightly elevated cmax, resulting in a modestly increased area under the plasma
concentration-time curve (auc). in healthy volunteers and patients with onychomycosis, a multiple-dosage
regimen of  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day increased cmax values by ≈25% and auc values by ≈ 2-fold at steady state.
 xxxd3314xxx  is rapidly delivered to the poorly perfused tissues of the nail, stratum corneum, hair and dermisepidermis. nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations are detected within 1 week after starting therapy and persist for at
least 30 weeks after the completion of treatment.
 xxxd3314xxx  undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformations, primarily phase i oxidation reactions. phase ii
conjugation reactions render the oxidated metabolites more hydrophilic and facilitate elimination by urinary
excretion. compared with azole metabolism,  xxxd3314xxx  metabolism utilizes a small fraction of hepatic cytochrome p450 (cyp) capacity (>60 vs ≤5%). the initial elimination half-life (t1/2beta ≈ 16 to 26 hours) is shorter
than the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2gamma ≈90 hours) after a single dose. t1/2gamma was 22 days in patients who
received 4 weeks of  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day. approximately 70 to 80% of a  xxxd3314xxx  dose is excreted in the
urine (as metabolites) with the remainder being eliminated via the feces. total plasma clearance of  xxxd3314xxx 
is 76 l/h in healthy volunteers.
unlike the azoles,  xxxd3314xxx  has a low potential for affecting the metabolism of other drugs because it has
affinity for ≤5% of liver cyp. however,  xxxd3314xxx  is a potent cyp2d6 inhibitor and will affect the pharmacokinetic profile of other drugs that are substrates for this enzyme (e.g. thioridazine, desipramine, nortriptyline,
paroxetine, venlafaxine, codeine and dextromethorphan) and the cardiovascular drugs metoprolol,  xxxd1991xxx ,
 xxxd2113xxx , propafenone and  xxxd2635xxx . in an open-label, randomized, crossover study involving 12 healthy
volunteers, pretreatment with oral  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day for 4 days) increased the auc of theophylline (after
a 5 mg/kg oral dose) by 16% (p = 0.03). post marketing surveillance could not detect any drug interaction signals
with oral antidiabetic agents,  xxxd236xxx , terfenadine and cimetidine. individual volunteer studies have failed
to detect clinically significant interactions between oral  xxxd3314xxx  250mg and warfarin 30mg, digoxin 0.75mg
or terfenadine 60mg twice daily. in contrast to the azoles,  xxxd3314xxx  250mg does not affect the time course of
midazolam or triazolam or interact with protease inhibitors. studies in healthy male volunteers (n = 20) and
organ transplant recipients with tinea unguium (n = 11) suggest that the coadministration of  xxxd3314xxx  250
mg/day has little effect on cyclosporin pharmacokinetics.  xxxd3314xxx  clearance may be decreased when
coadministered with cimetidine and increased by rifampin (rifampicin).

therapeutic use

randomized, double-blind trials have shown oral  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day for 12 or 16 weeks) to be more
effective than intermittent (3 or 4 cycles of 400 mg/day for 1 week every 4 weeks) or continuous (200 mg/day
for 12 or 16 weeks) itraconazole and fluconazole (150 mg/week for 12 or 24 weeks) in dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toenails. importantly, the complete, mycologic and clinical cure rates of  xxxd3314xxx  continued
to increase after the completion of therapy.
the multicenter, multinational, l.i.on. (lamisil® vs itraconazole in onychomycosis) study found that the
12-week (and 16-week)  xxxd3314xxx  treatment regimen achieved complete and mycologic cure rates of 46%
(55%) and 76% (81%), respectively, at the 72-week follow-up. the corresponding rates in the 3-month (and
4-month) itraconazole treatment group (400 mg/day for 1 week repeated every 4 weeks) were 23% (26%) and
38% (49%). all cure rates were higher in the  xxxd3314xxx  group than in the itraconazole group to a statistically
significant extent (p < 0.01 for all comparisons).
in addition, the randomized, double-blind, l.i.on. (lamisil® vs itraconazole in onychomycosis) icelandic
extension study (l.i.on.i.e.s.) found that  xxxd3314xxx  produced a greater complete cure rate (35 vs 14%, p <
0.005), mycologic cure rate (46 vs 13%, p < 0.001) and clinical cure rate (42 vs 18%, p < 0.0024) than intermittent
itraconazole in the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis at 5-year follow-up. the mycologic relapse rates
were 23% in the  xxxd3314xxx  group compared with 53% in the itraconazole group (p < 0.01). the clinical relapse
rate was 21% and 48% in the  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole groups, respectively (p < 0.05). all patients (n = 72)
in the l.i.on.i.e.s. who required a second treatment course received  xxxd3314xxx , irrespective of whether they
had received  xxxd3314xxx  or itraconazole initially. importantly, 72% of these recipients achieved a complete cure.
a meta-analysis of 26 published articles reported that oral  xxxd3314xxx  produced a disease-free toenail (normalappearing nail plus mycologic cure) in approximately 35 to 50% of patients with onychomycosis compared with
25 to 40% of itraconazole recipients. limited data suggest that oral  xxxd3314xxx  has good efficacy in the treatment
of dermatophyte onychomycosis in patients with concomitant systemic disease.

darkes et al.

 xxxd3314xxx  is not well studied in onychomycosis involving yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds; notably
though, ≈90% of fungal nail infections are caused by dermatophyte infections. comparative (placebo-controlled)
and noncomparative data suggest that  xxxd3314xxx  has efficacy in non-dermatophyte onychomycosis but further
comparative studies involving the azoles are required to confirm these observations.
tolerability

in comparative studies, oral  xxxd3314xxx  had a better tolerability profile than  xxxd2235xxx  and a comparable
profile to that of itraconazole or fluconazole. there is a rare incidence (<1 in 1000 and >1 in 10 000 exposures)
of serious hepatic reactions and a very rare incidence (<1 in 10 000 exposures) of serious hematologic and
dermatologic reactions associated with oral  xxxd3314xxx  treatment.
oral  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day was well tolerated in a large post marketing surveillance study involving
>25 000 recipients treated for a median duration of 12 weeks. the percentage of patients who experienced
adverse events was 10.5%; 4.9, 2.3 and 3.3% of patients experienced gastrointestinal, dermatologic and other
events, respectively. slightly more than half (55.9%) of all adverse events were considered by investigators to
be possibly or probably related to  xxxd3314xxx  treatment. the adverse events tended to be reversible. the study
found that approximately half of those who reported adverse events terminated  xxxd3314xxx  treatment prematurely
(5.3% of patients). treatment terminations were primarily due to gastrointestinal disorders (2.7% of patients).

pharmacoeconomic
considerations

most pharmacoeconomic evaluations have shown that the greater clinical effectiveness of oral  xxxd3314xxx  in
treating dermatophyte onychomycosis translates into a cost-effectiveness ratio superior to that of itraconazole,
fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx . in particular, pharmacoeconomic analysis based on clinical results of a randomized, double-blind trial showed that  xxxd3314xxx  had a lower cost-per-patient-cured ratio and produced a greater
number of disease-free days than intermittent itraconazole despite the tolerability comparison being skewed in
favor of itraconazole (1998 costs).

 xxxd3314xxx  hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail
due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium) and for the treatment of other superficial mycoses.
the usual adult dosage of  xxxd3314xxx  for the treatment of tinea unguium of the fingernail and toenail is 250
mg/day for 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. in most countries,  xxxd3314xxx  has not been licensed to treat onychomycosis in children.  xxxd3314xxx  is not recommended in patients with chronic or active liver disease. there is
no evidence to suggest that dosage adjustment is required in the elderly. however, a dosage adjustment may be
required in patients who receive concomitant cimetidine or rifampin. fingernails are usually re-evaluated 18
weeks or longer, and toenails are re-evaluated 6 to 9 months or longer, after completion of therapy. clinical
benefit is optimal some months after the completion of treatment and corresponds to the time required for healthy
nail outgrowth. some patients may benefit from extended and/or repeated courses of  xxxd3314xxx  therapy.

1. introduction
onychomycosis is a general term used to describe a fungal
infection of the nail unit caused by dermatophytes, yeasts or nondermatophyte molds.[1-3] microbiologically, onychomycosis is
differentiated from tinea unguium, which refers to nail plate invasion by dermatophytes only.[4] indeed, the dermatophytes are
responsible for most cases of onychomycosis. approximately
90% of fungal nail infections are caused by dermatophyte infections.[5-8]
the overall estimated prevalence of onychomycosis is between 3 and 8%.[3] there is a greater prevalence of this infection
in patients with diabetes mellitus (26%),[9] in immunocompromised patients (11 to 67%)[10] and in people over 60 years of age
(30%).[10] in the uk, the estimated incidence of onychomycosis
is 4.8 per 1000 adults,[11] and the estimated prevalence is 2.8% for
men and 2.6% for women.[11] the disease accounts for ≈50% of
all nail disorders.[12-14] toenail infections are diagnosed several

times more frequently than fingernail infections.[11,15] the incidence of onychomycosis is increasing partly because of the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus, the spread of hiv, the
increasing use of immunosuppressants and the growing number
of elderly people in the population.[16] in fact, the annual cost of
onychomycosis was higher than $us43 million (year of costing
unavailable) in us medicare patients older than 65 years of
age.[12]
onychomycosis is often accompanied by tinea pedis.[17] it is
possible that onychomycosis is caused by a concomitant tinea
pedis infection that has spread into the nail plate.[3,18-21] because
a warm, damp microenvironment provides ideal growing conditions for many fungi, it is not surprising that the use of communal
swimming pools, showers and changing rooms[17,22] as well as the
use of occlusive footwear[23] are risk factors for tinea pedis and,
therefore, onychomycosis.
left untreated, onychomycosis is a long-lasting disease,[24]

 xxxd3314xxx 

which rarely resolves spontaneously.[3] it has a physically and
psychologically deleterious effect on patients who regard the infection as an embarrassment.[19,25] onychomycosis reduces quality of life by causing physical pain and disrupting lifestyles, especially the sporting activities of athletes.[12,25-27] the disease
negatively effects high-risk groups (e.g. patients with diabetes
mellitus) by increasing the risk of further physical and functional
deterioration.[21] furthermore, the disease can be easily transmitted from an infected patient to family members.[28] figure 1 shows
an example of toenail onychomycosis.
 xxxd3314xxx , an orally and topically active antimycotic agent,
was first marketed in 1991 in the uk and is the most recent oral drug
to be licensed for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis.
previous reviews have highlighted the use of oral and topical
 xxxd3314xxx  in superficial mycoses.[29,30] the aim of this article is
to provide a comprehensive review of the clinical pharmacology
of oral  xxxd3314xxx  in the treatment of onychomycosis in adults.
strategies for the management of onychomycosis have been reviewed elsewhere[1,15,19,28,31,32] and are discussed in section 8.

2. pharmacodynamic properties
 xxxd3314xxx  is a synthetic allylamine, which was developed
by chemical modification of naftifine in 1979 with the findings
of the synthesis first published in 1984.[33] discovered serendipitously, naftifine demonstrated antifungal activity[34] but was suitable for topical use only. however, an intense derivatization program (>1000 analogs) based on this prototype led to the
development of  xxxd3314xxx , an orally and topically active antimycotic with potent in vitro activity against a wide range of fungi
(section 2.2).[35]  xxxd3314xxx  is structurally distinct from other

coloration, thickening and deformity.

clinically relevant antimycotic agents, featuring a naphthalene
ring system that displays an acetylene function conjugated with
an allylamine function (figure 2).[33]

2.1 mechanism of action and resistance issues

 xxxd3314xxx  exerts its antimycotic effects by inhibiting fungal
sterol biosynthesis to a greater extent than mammalian sterol biosynthesis. it does so by reversibly inhibiting the membrane-bound
enzyme  xxxg2197xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner.[36-38] in the absence of  xxxd3314xxx ,  xxxg2197xxx  converts squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene, which is then cyclized to
lanosterol by other enzymes.[39] lanosterol is converted to cholesterol and/or ergosterol, the amount of formation of each depending on the species of cell. crucially,  xxxd3314xxx -induced inhibition of  xxxg2197xxx  is qualitatively and quantitatively
different between fungal and mammalian cells.
lineweaver-burke analyses have shown  xxxd3314xxx  to display non-competitive kinetics with fungal  xxxg2197xxx  but
competitive kinetics with its mammalian counterpart over a range
of squalene concentrations.[33,37] moreover, the dissociation constant (ki) of the fungal enzyme- xxxd3314xxx  complex is three orders of magnitude lower than for corresponding mammalian complexes.[37] ki values of 0.03, 0.04 and 77 mug/l were reported for
enzyme derived from candida albicans, c. parapsilosis and rat
liver cell-free extracts, respectively.[37] therefore, the greater sensitivity of fungal than mammalian  xxxg2197xxx  for  xxxd3314xxx  accounts for the allylamine’s selective toxicity.
figure 3 illustrates the  xxxd3314xxx  sensitivity of a variety of
squalene epoxidases isolated from fungal species implicated in
onychomycosis.[38]  xxxg2197xxx  sensitivity is expressed as
the concentration of drug required to inhibit sterol biosynthesis
by 95% (ic95). interestingly, the ic95 values for  xxxg2197xxx 
derived from the dermatophytes are at least one order of magnitude lower than those derived from candida species, which is
reflected in the corresponding  xxxd3314xxx  minimum inhibitory
concentrations (mics) against both fungal species (section 2.2).[38]
the consequences of  xxxg2197xxx  inhibition are 2fold.[40] the effect of  xxxd3314xxx -induced ergosterol depletion
from fungal cell membranes is fungistatic. a more dramatic consequence of  xxxg2197xxx  inhibition is the intracellular accumulation of its substrate, squalene, which exerts a fungicidal
effect[41] by perturbing phospholipid membranes.[42,43] although
 xxxd3314xxx  exerts a fungicidal effect against dermatophytes and
the yeast c. parapsilosis, only a fungistatic effect is exerted
against most strains of c. albicans (section 2.2).[41] when  xxxd3314xxx  binding affinities for  xxxg2197xxx  were related to
its corresponding mic values against a variety of fungal species,

genes.[48] over expression in c. albicans and saccharomyces
cerevisiae of the cdr1 and cdr2 genes, and of the benr gene,
has conferred resistance to  xxxd3314xxx  in vitro.[49] furthermore,
knockout of the cdr1 gene rendered c. albicans hypersusceptible to  xxxd3314xxx .[49] therefore, some pathogenic fungi appear to
have the potential to develop resistance to  xxxd3314xxx  but these
mechanisms have yet to evolve into a clinical problem.

two different fungal populations were identified.[41] complete
growth inhibition of one population is achieved at  xxxd3314xxx 
concentrations that cause only a partial inhibition of squalene
epoxidase. it is argued that these fungi experience the  xxxd3440xxx  effects
of  xxxd3314xxx . however, complete  xxxg2197xxx  inhibition
is required to prevent fungal growth (fungistatic effect) of the
second population.
azoles also prevent cellular sterol production, and do so by
inhibiting the heme protein cytochrome p450 (cyp)-dependent
14alpha-demethylase.[44] the inhibition leads to the accumulation of
14alpha-methylated sterols that can still penetrate membranes but
cause structural abnormalities. this accounts, at least in part, for
the fungistatic properties of azoles. certainly against the dermatophytes, it appears that the difference in sensitivity between
fungal and mammalian cyp-dependent 14alpha-demethylase for
azoles is not as clinically exploitable as the difference between
fungal and mammalian  xxxg2197xxx  for  xxxd3314xxx . however, other ‘necessary conditions’[45] (e.g. intrinsic physiological
factors unique to each strain of fungi)[41] also determine fungal
susceptibility to antimycotic agents. the molecular modes of action of  xxxd3314xxx  and the azoles dictate their clinical (section 4),
metabolic (section 3.3) and drug-interaction (section 3.5) profiles.
although the incidence of resistance to  xxxd3314xxx  appears
to be rare, recently there have been two case reports of resistance
to  xxxd3314xxx  in dermatophytes.[46,47] in addition, several c. albicans isolates have reduced susceptibility to  xxxd3314xxx  that may
be caused by an over expression of multidrug efflux transporter

2.2 in vitro activity

the anthropophilic dermatophytes are responsible for ≈90%
of toenail[5-8] (figure 4) and ≈50% of fingernail[6] infections.
dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds may be the
sole agents of disease or be associated with each other in the
pathological process.[2,6,50-53] in decreasing order by incidence,
trichophyton rubrum, t. mentagrophytes and epidermophyton
floccosum are the principal dermatophytes isolated from nail infections in many parts of europe and north america.[2] c. albicans is the dominant species of yeast involved.[52] of the 35
non-dermatophyte molds that can cause onychomycosis,[2]
scopulariopsis spp. and scytalidium spp. are the most frequent
pathogens implicated.[6,54]
in this review, in vitro antifungal activity refers to the mics
and minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) determined by
agar and broth dilution techniques. the mic is an absolute value
and is defined as the lowest concentration of antifungal tested that
prevents fungal growth during a defined period of incubation

(from ≈2 to 7 days) at ≈30 to 35°c.[55,56] according to the method
used, the endpoint may be defined as complete or partial (e.g. 80%)
inhibition of fungal growth. the mfc is also an absolute value
and is defined as the lowest concentration of antifungal tested that
eradicates viable fungal growth, generally defined as reduction
of the viable count of the inoculum by at least 99.9%.[55] an
antimycotic is fungicidal in vitro when the mic is equivalent to
the mfc (mfc/mic ≤4).[55,57] in vitro fungistatic activity is defined as the ratio of mfc/mic >4.[55] to date, all of the aforementioned terms are loosely defined in the literature and require
standardization.
large variations in mics for antifungal agents have been
reported; these variations have been attributed to unstandardized
methodological factors, rendering mic comparisons across studies inappropriate.[56] nevertheless,  xxxd3314xxx  mic and mfc results have been consistent against the dermatophytes. although
approved quality control guidelines have been recommended by
the national committee for clinical laboratory standards
(nccls) for the yeasts,[58,59] the standardization of antifungal
susceptibility testing of the slow-growing molds is currently in
development.[60-63] although it is important to relate all mic values to  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations that are clinically achievable
within target tissues (section 3.2), in vitro results represent an

cause many ‘sufficient conditions’[45] are unaccountable (e.g.
host factors). furthermore, many in vitro studies measure an antimycotic’s inhibitory effects on actively growing fungi whereas
these pathogens are largely dormant in vivo.[50] direct correlations between in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy are, therefore,
lacking.
2.2.1 dermatophytes

 xxxd3314xxx  has demonstrated excellent in vitro activity
against a wide range of dermatophytes with mic values typically
ranging from 0.0015 to 0.01 mg/l [64] (extensively reviewed by
ryder and leitner[65]). figure 5 illustrates the  xxxd3314xxx  mic
results against dermatophytes in one of the largest studies (n =
112 isolates).[64]
fungal cell morphology and incubation time has a modest
effect on the mic and mfc results for  xxxd3314xxx .[61] after a
48-hour  xxxd3314xxx  incubation time, no growth of the conidial or
hyphal forms of microsporum canis were observed. after 72 and
96 hours, respectively, the mic results for  xxxd3314xxx  against the
conidial form were <0.004 and 0.004 mg/l compared with 0.004
and 0.008 mg/l against the hyphal form. the corresponding mic
values against t. tonsurans were 0.016 (against conidia) and
0.031 (against hyphae) for both incubation periods. the  xxxd3314xxx  mfc values against m. canis (conidia vs hyphae) over 24-,
48- and 72-hour incubations were 0.016 vs 0.008 mg/l, 1.0 vs
am j clin dermatol 2003; 4 (1)

46

darkes et al.

0.075 mg/l and 2.0 vs 5.0 mg/l, respectively. the corresponding
mfc values against t. tonsurans were 0.016 mg/l vs no growth,
0.016 vs 0.031 mg/l and 0.016 vs 0.031 mg/l.
a us study demonstrated that oatmeal cereal agar provides
an effective growth medium for dermatophytes to produce conidia and, therefore, facilitates the preparation of isolates of uniform morphology for susceptibility testing.[62] using this growth
medium, 217 dermatophytes (obtained from nail or hair specimens) were tested for  xxxd3314xxx  susceptibility.  xxxd3314xxx  demonstrated excellent activity against inocula (103 conidia/ml) of t.
rubrum (mic90 0.002 mg/l), t. mentagrophytes (mic90 0.001
mg/l), t. tonsurans (mic90 0.008 mg/l), m. canis (mic90 0.03
mg/l) and e. floccosum (mic90 0.015 mg/l).[62]
the mics of  xxxd3314xxx  against 50 dermatophyte strains isolated from skin, nail and hair specimens were measured using
agar macrodilution and broth microdilution tests.[63] when the
agar macrodilution method was used, the  xxxd3314xxx  mic90 value
was 0.2 mg/l against all dermatophytes includingt. rubrum (mic
range 0.02 to 0.2 mg/l), t. mentagrophytes (mic range 0.1 to 0.2
mg/l), t. quinckeanum (one isolate) and m. canis (one isolate).
when the broth microdilution test was used, the  xxxd3314xxx 
mic90 values were consistently lower for all isolates. the mic90
values against t. rubrum and t. mentagrophytes were both 0.01
mg/l (mic range 0.001 to 0.01 mg/l) compared with mic90

values of 0.001 mg/l against each strain of t. quinckeanum and
m. canis.
 xxxd3314xxx  exhibited a primarily fungicidal effect on 39
dermatophytes with a geometric mean mic and mfc value of
0.004 mg/l (mic range 0.003 to 0.006 mg/l).[66] a separate study
showed  xxxd3314xxx  was fungicidal against t. rubrum (mic and
mfc both 0.0076 mg/l), but not t. mentagrophytes (mic 0.0039
mg/l, mfc 4.0 mg/l) after 72 hours of incubation.[57] however,
 xxxd3314xxx  was fungicidal against t. mentagrophytes after 48
hours of incubation. in addition, time-kill studies demonstrated
that  xxxd3314xxx  may have time-dependent fungicidal activity
against t. mentagrophytes.[57] cell death was evident within 3
hours after exposure to  xxxd3314xxx  and ≈40 to 50% of the hyphae
appeared to have died after 6 to 7 hours.  xxxd3314xxx  also demonstrated a post-antibiotic effect period of ≈6 to 12 hours against t.
rubrum and t. mentagrophytes at their mics.[57]
2.2.2 yeasts

although  xxxd3314xxx  exhibited potent activity against a
range of dermatophyte species, the drug had higher and more
variable mics against pathogenic yeasts.[67] using the approved
nccls broth macrodilution assay,[58]  xxxd3314xxx  activity was
measured against yeasts derived from 350 fresh clinical isolates
from north and south america.[67]  xxxd3314xxx  mic50 and mic90
values against 259 isolates of c. albicans were 1.0 and 4.0 mg/l,
respectively (mic range 0.03 to >128 mg/l). although, 16 isolates had  xxxd3314xxx  mics higher than 8 mg/l, 90% of mics
were within a 0.25 to 4 mg/l range. figure 6 illustrates  xxxd3314xxx 
mic50 values against several species of candida.
an austrian study found that  xxxd3314xxx  had mic50 and mic95
values of 25 and 50 mg/l, respectively, against c. albicans derived from 78 clinical isolates (mic range 6.25 to 100 mg/l).[64]
 xxxd3314xxx  demonstrated greater potency against c. parapsilosis
(n = 20 isolates) with mic50 and mic95 values of 0.28 and 2.92 mg/l
(mic range 0.1 to 3.13 mg/l). indeed,  xxxd3314xxx  was fungicidal
toward c. parapsilosis but fungistatic toward c. albicans.[64]
in a us study,  xxxd3314xxx  mic values against three strains
of c. parapsilosis (n = 11 isolates) ranged from 0.25 to 1.0
mg/l.[68] the mfc/mic ratio ranged from 1 to 16, indicating that
 xxxd3314xxx  has fungistatic rather than fungicidal activity against
these particular strains. against c. lusitaniae (n = 3 isolates) and
c. rugosa (n = 2 isolates), respectively,  xxxd3314xxx  had an mic
range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/l and ≤0.125 mg/l. c. rugosa, in particular, appeared to be highly susceptible.
against 30 strains of c. albicans that had reduced susceptibility to azoles, the in vitro combination of  xxxd3314xxx  with
fluconazole or itraconazole was more effective than  xxxd3314xxx 
alone.[69]  xxxd3314xxx  mic50 and mic90 values were 8.0 and >8.0

mean of the  xxxd3314xxx  mic (from 8.4 to 1.7 mg/l, p = 0.0001)
and the fluconazole mic (from 11.8 to 2.9 mg/l, p = 0.002) was

reductions and 57% of the reductions were additive interactions.

2.3 ex vivo activity

a significant amount of preclinical research has measured
the effects of antimycotics in human stratum corneum infections[71] but there is a paucity of data concerning their effects in
experimental nail infections. this type of simulation may model
the in vivo pharmacodynamics of antifungal agents better than in
vitro dilution techniques. corneofungimetry experiments showed
that  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole were equally effective against
dermatophytes. however, c. albicans was more susceptible to
itraconazole than  xxxd3314xxx .[50]
the antifungal activity of  xxxd3314xxx  was assessed in a developmental ex vivo model of nail invasion by dermatophytes,
yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds.[72] healthy nail specimens
were inoculated with fungal suspensions and incubated at 28°c.
growth of t. mentagrophytes was first visible after 7 days compared with the non-dermatophyte molds, which first appeared at
about 4 days. growth of c. albicans was visible at the end of the
7-day incubation period. a 7-day incubation period with  xxxd3314xxx 
(1 mg/l) completely inhibited the growth of t. mentagrophytes
and partially inhibited the growth of c. albicans, s. brevicaulis,
a. versicolor or fusarium.

3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd3314xxx  has been extensively reviewed previously[29,73-75] and is summarized in table i.

3.1 absorption
2.2.3 non-dermatophyte molds

the mic ranges of  xxxd3314xxx  against a range of nondermatophyte molds were as follows: scytalidium dimidiatum,
0.06 to 0.12 mg/l; s. hyalinum, 0.25 mg/l; scopulariopsis
brevicaulis, 0.5 to 2.0 mg/l; acremonium spp., 0.25 to 8.0 mg/l;
and aspergillus spp., 0.03 to 0.25 mg/l.[66] an earlier study found
that  xxxd3314xxx  (then called sf 86-327) had the same mic50 and
mic90 values against aspergillus flavus (≤0.06 mg/l) and an
mic50 and mic90 value of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively,
against a. fumigatus.[70]
 xxxd3314xxx  exhibited fungicidal activity against a. fumigatus
and s. brevicaulis (both mics 0.8 mg/l).[64] five days after the
addition of  xxxd3314xxx  at their mic, at least a 3 log10 reduction

following the oral administration a single dose of  xxxd3314xxx 
250mg, peak plasma concentrations (cmax) of ≈0.8 to 1.5 mg/l
are achieved within 1.3 to 2 hours (tmax). although  xxxd3314xxx  is
well absorbed (≥70%)[81] by a first-order process at therapeutic
doses,[77] bioavailability is 47% because of first-pass hepatic extraction.[24] bioavailability of  xxxd3314xxx  is further reduced by
intense binding to serum proteins (≈94%).[80] the area under the
plasma concentration-time curve (auc) is modestly increased by
the concomitant intake of food, which causes small delays in tmax
and slightly elevated cmax values.[82] in healthy volunteers and
patients with onychomycosis, a multiple-dosage regimen of  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day increased cmax values by ≈25% and auc
values by ≈2-fold at steady state.[24,76,83]

3.2 distribution

 xxxd3314xxx  is widely distributed to poorly perfused body
tissues and body fluids including the nail, stratum corneum, hair
and dermis-epidermis,[84,85] and breast milk.[86] less than 8% of
the total drug is present in blood cells.[79]
in 12 patients with onychomycosis,  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day
for up to 48 weeks) was first detected in distal nail clippings 3 to
18 weeks [mean 7.8 weeks, standard deviation (sd) ±4.4] after
starting treatment.[87] mean nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations ranged
from 0.25 to 0.55 ng/mg and the kinetic profile of the drug was
similar in affected and unaffected nails. the early detection of
 xxxd3314xxx  in the distal nail clippings suggests that the drug rapidly diffuses throughout the nail plate rather than advancing with
newly formed nail tissue. nails became negative for fungi on
microscopy after week 29 (sd ±15.6) and negative on culture
from week 7 (sd ±9.9).[87]
in a separate study by the same investigators,  xxxd3314xxx 
(250 mg/day for up to 3 months) was detected in 6 of 12 and 11
of 12 patients at week 4 and 12, respectively.[88] nail  xxxd3314xxx 
concentrations ranged from 0.10 to 2.89 ng/mg (mean range 0.3
to 0.6 ng/mg) and nail concentrations at week 12 did not exceed
those at week 4, indicating that steady state conditions were
achieved.
in 12 healthy male volunteers who received oral  xxxd3314xxx 
(250 mg/day for 4 weeks), a maximum nail concentration of 0.39
ng/mg nail was observed 1 day after the completion of therapy.[84]
moreover, a nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentration of 0.09 ng/mg was

measured 55 days after therapy had stopped. a more recent study
detected  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day) within 1 week of starting oral
therapy.[89] maximum nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations were 0.52
and 1.01 ng/mg at week 18 for patients who received 6 and 12
weeks of treatment, respectively.  xxxd3314xxx  was detected in the
nails 30 weeks (6 weeks of treatment) and 36 weeks (12 weeks
of treatment) after the completion of therapy (range 0.19 to 0.28
ng/mg). as a result of the aforementioned experimental findings,
the original 6- to 12-month  xxxd3314xxx  treatment regimen was
reduced to 6 weeks for fingernail mycosis and 12 weeks for toenail mycosis (section 7).
the non-specific binding of  xxxd3314xxx  to human serum proteins (particularly albumin and high- and low-density lipoproteins) reduces the ability of the drug to inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in vitro.[80] however, the extensive protein binding is
advantageous in vivo because it provides ‘sink’ conditions. protein binding (as well as the systemic circulation) maintains a large
concentration gradient across the gastrointestinal membranes,
thereby ensuring extensive drug absorption. moreover, plasma
proteins (and adipose tissue) act as a ‘ xxxd3314xxx  reservoir’ providing free drug to the systemic circulation over long time periods. free  xxxd3314xxx  passively diffuses into poorly perfused tissues from the circulation down a concentration gradient until
steady state conditions are reached. therefore, ‘sink’ conditions
facilitate the accumulation of  xxxd3314xxx  in poorly perfused tissues such as the nail plate where the antimycotic exerts its pharmacodynamic effects (section 2).
a typical peak nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentration (0.5 to 1.5
ng/mg) is similar to that of itraconazole (0.5 to 1.0 ng/mg).[28]
nail  xxxd3314xxx  concentrations are several orders of magnitude
higher than its mfcs for the dermatophytes (0.004 mug/ml) but the
nail itraconazole concentrations are similar to its mfc values (0.6
mug/ml). however, direct comparisons of nail drug concentrations
with mic (and mfc) values are difficult because these antimycotics
are solutes in two structurally different solvent systems; namely
a solid solution (nail matrix) and a semi-solid/liquid (agar/broth)
solution. nevertheless,  xxxd3314xxx ’s greater in vitro activity (on a per
mole basis) coupled with its in vivo distribution profile provides the
best explanation for its superior clinical effectiveness (section 4).

 xxxd3314xxx  undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformations,
primarily phase i oxidation reactions.[79] phase ii conjugation
reactions render the oxidated metabolites more hydrophilic and
facilitate elimination by urinary excretion. of the 15  xxxd3314xxx 
metabolites identified, the n-demethylation and monohydroxy
derivatives are the major metabolites identified in human plasma.[79]
am j clin dermatol 2003; 4 (1)

 xxxd3314xxx 

none of the metabolites identified have the antifungal activity of
 xxxd3314xxx .[24] compared with azole metabolism,  xxxd3314xxx  metabolism utilizes a small fraction of hepatic cyp capacity (>60
vs ≤5%).[90]
analysis of the [14c]- xxxd3314xxx  plasma concentration-time
curve revealed that the drug’s pharmacokinetics are best described by a three-compartment model.[81] after a single oral dose
of  xxxd3314xxx  250mg, there is a rapid absorption half-life (t1⁄2abs)
of 0.8 to 1.2 hours followed by two elimination phases (table i).
the initial elimination half-life (t1⁄2beta ≈16 to 26 hours)[77-79] is
shorter than the terminal elimination half-life (t1⁄2gamma ≈90 hours).[81]
t1⁄2beta probably represents elimination from the central compartments whereas t1⁄2gamma may represent the slow elimination from adipose tissue and nails. t1⁄2gamma was 22 days in patients who received 4
weeks of  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day.[78]
approximately 80% of a  xxxd3314xxx  dose is excreted in the
urine (as metabolites) with the remainder being eliminated via the
feces (table i).[24,81] total plasma clearance of  xxxd3314xxx  is 76
l/h in healthy volunteers.
3.4 special patient populations

because  xxxd3314xxx  undergoes extensive hepatic biotransformations, it is not unexpected that the drug has a reduced velocity of elimination in recipients who have liver dysfunction.
cmax, tmax, t1⁄2abs, t1⁄2gamma and volume of distribution at steady state
were similar in patients with liver dysfunction to those of healthy
volunteers but total  xxxd3314xxx  clearance was decreased (75.5 vs
49.5 l/h).[79] the auc of  xxxd3314xxx  was greater in patients with
liver dysfunction than in healthy volunteers (6.4 vs 3.6 mg • h/l).
the demethyl metabolite auc to  xxxd3314xxx  auc ratio was reduced from 1.3 in healthy volunteers to 0.4 in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 7).
the t1/2beta of  xxxd3314xxx  was longer (23.8 vs 16.4 hours) and
the total  xxxd3314xxx  clearance rate was lower (36.2 vs 75.5 l/h)
in patients with renal dysfunction compared with healthy volunteers.[79] consequently, the auc of  xxxd3314xxx  was greater in
patients with renal impairment (9.0 vs 3.6 mg • h/l). renal insufficiency may increase the systemic exposure of  xxxd3314xxx  by
secondary effects on liver function. reduced urinary excretion of
the carboxylic acid metabolite may compete with  xxxd3314xxx  for
hepatic demethylation isoenzymes.[79]
3.5 drug interactions

unlike the azoles,  xxxd3314xxx  has a low potential for affecting the metabolism of other drugs (see section 2.1) because it has
affinity for ≤5% of cyp enzymes of the liver.[90,91] however,
 xxxd3314xxx  is a potent cyp2d6 inhibitor and affects the pharma© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

cokinetic profile of other drugs that are substrates for this enzyme.[91-93] cyp2d6 substrates include a variety of psychopharmacologic agents (e.g. thioridazine, desipramine, nortriptyline,
paroxetine, venlafaxine, codeine and dextromethorphan) and cardiovascular drugs (metoprolol,  xxxd1991xxx ,  xxxd2113xxx , propafenone
and  xxxd2635xxx ).[94] occasionally, the effect of  xxxd3314xxx  on tricyclic antidepressant pharmacokinetics has been accompanied by
evidence of toxicity (e.g. fatigue, vertigo, loss of energy and appetite).[95-97] cyp2d6 represents only 1.5% of total human hepatic cyp and is not accountable for the complete metabolism of
all aforementioned drugs.
coadministration of  xxxd3314xxx  with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine inhibited the cyp2d6 metabolism of desipramine in 12 healthy volunteers who were identified as extensive
metabolisers of this cyp enzyme.[98] there were marked increases in cmax (19 vs 36 mug/l) and auc (482 vs 2383 mug • h/l)
values for desipramine, whereas those of its metabolite were reduced.
 xxxd3314xxx  appears to slightly impair the metabolism of the
xanthines via the cyp1a2 pathway.[99,100] in a non-blind, randomized, crossover study involving 12 healthy volunteers, pretreatment with oral  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day for 4 days) increased
the auc of theophylline (after a 5 mg/kg oral dose) by 16% (p =
0.03).[99]
data analyses from a post marketing surveillance study[101]
of 25 884 patients who received  xxxd3314xxx  could not detect any
drug interaction signals[102] with other coadministered drugs.
some  xxxd3314xxx  recipients in this study received concomitant
oral antidiabetic agents,  xxxd236xxx , terfenadine and cimetidine.
volunteer studies have failed to detect clinically significant
interactions between oral  xxxd3314xxx  250mg and warfarin 30mg,[103]
digoxin 0.75mg[104] or terfenadine 60mg twice daily.[105] in contrast to the azoles,  xxxd3314xxx  250mg does not affect the time
course of midazolam[106] or triazolam;[107] both of these benzodiazepine hypnotics are hepatically metabolized via cyp3a4.
studies in healthy male volunteers (n = 20)[108] and organ
transplant recipients with tinea unguium (n = 11)[109] suggest that
the coadministration of  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day has little effect
on cyclosporin pharmacokinetics. both studies detected a small
reduction in the auc for cyclosporin.
in healthy volunteers, the auc of  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day)
was increased from 4.1 to 5.5 mg • h/l by cimetidine (400mg twice
daily) but reduced to 2.0 mg • h/l by rifampin (600 mg/day).[79]
this study showed that the clearance of  xxxd3314xxx  alone was
71.8 l/h compared with 50.1 and 148.1 l/h when the drug was
given with cimetidine and rifampin, respectively.
in contrast to the azoles, no drug interactions between  xxxd3314xxx  and protease inhibitors in patients with hiv have been

reported to date. all currently available protease inhibitors are
inhibitors of cyp3a4.[110] in vitro studies with human liver
microsomes found that  xxxd3314xxx  does not inhibit the metabolism of  xxxd3394xxx ,  xxxd2054xxx  and ethoxycoumarin.[24]

4. therapeutic use
this section describes the efficacy of oral  xxxd3314xxx  (250
mg/day) in clinical trials involving patients with a positive diagnosis for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, yeasts or nondermatophyte molds. most studies focused on toenail onychomycosis. the main inclusion/exclusion criteria were:
• a clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis confirmed by culture
and microscopic examination of potassium hydroxide (koh)
wet mount preparations of nail clippings;[3,32]
• cessation of topical and systemic antimycotics at least 1 and
3 months, respectively, before randomization;
• age 18 years and over;
• normal hepatic and renal function;
• otherwise good health with no indication of systemic disease;
• pregnant or breast-feeding women were excluded from trial
entry;
• women of child-bearing age used reliable contraceptive
methods until the study drugs were stopped.
the clinical trials measured  xxxd3314xxx  efficacy based on
evaluative mycologic tests (culture and direct microscopy) and
clinical response to treatment. individually, both methods have
their limitations. mycologic tests can be insufficiently sensitive and
selective. approximately 30 to 50% of nail clippings test positive
on microscopy but negative in culture because fungi at the distal
end of the nail unit are dead.[3,111] nail samples from the proximal
area of infection, which would contain viable pathogenic fungi,
are inconvenient to collect. in fact, given the complex ecological
environment of micro-organisms, it is difficult to confirm that the
fungus observed under the microscope is of the same species that
grew in culture.[32] the converse situation can also arise when poorly
collected nail clippings lead to a false-negative result.[3,112] because nails have no regenerative power, it takes longer for dead
hyphae to ‘grow out’ with the nail than it does for antimycotics
to kill the pathogenic fungi. therefore, mycologic cure rates based
on microscopy tend to be lower than rates based on culture. a
mycologic cure based on both techniques is desirable.
two main methods were used to determine the clinical response to treatment, both of which were subjective. clinical disease activity (e.g. onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and
discoloration and thickening of the nail)[111] was graded according to a four-point scale (i.e. 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate,
3 = severe). the second method quantified comparative efficacy
by observing and recording the outward movement of a scratch

(scored with a file and etched with permanent ink before randomization) between infected and normal areas of a ‘target’ nail (usually the big toe) at each follow-up visit. some trials reported a
global clinical evaluation that was determined by combining the
two clinical response data sets.
trial endpoints derived from laboratory tests and/or clinical
examination included mycologic cure (negative mycology as determined by negative microscopy and negative culture), clinical
efficacy (negative mycology with no or minimal signs or symptoms of infection), clinical cure (100% normal-looking nail) and
complete cure (negative mycology plus clinical cure). the mycologic cure rate was measured at the end of treatment and/or at the
end of follow-up. clinical cure rates were measured at the end of
follow-up. a follow-up period of at least 12 months from the start
of treatment is desirable because this is the time needed for a
toenail to grow out.[28] extended durations of follow-up take into
account one of the most important parameters of therapeutic response, the relapse/re-infection rate. although a follow-up period
that extends beyond 2 years makes differentiating between relapse and re-infection difficult,[11] valuable data can still be collected because onychomycosis is a recalcitrant disease.[3,32] not
only does mycologic cure always precede clinical cure, its rate
tends to be higher than the clinical cure rate. therefore, it is not
uncommon for patients to experience a mycological cure but not
a clinical cure.

4.1 dermatophyte infections

randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies of  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day for 3 to 6 months) produced mycologic cure rates
of between 40 and 90% in evaluable patients depending on follow-up duration.[113-116] increasing the dosage to 500mg once
daily for 16 weeks[112] or extending the duration of treatment to
12 months[117] did not appear to correspond to higher complete
cure rates. a shortened treatment duration of 6 weeks was adequate for treating onychomycosis of the fingers but not for treating infected toes.[1,118,119]
three randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated that  xxxd3314xxx  was more effective than  xxxd2235xxx  in treating
dermatophyte onychomycosis,[120-122] which has been verified by
a meta-analysis[123] of two of these studies.[120,121] in one of the
trials (n = 195), the cure rate (negative mycology plus continuous
growth of uninfected nail) at the 72-week follow-up in patients
who received  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day for 24 weeks) was 60%
compared with 39% in patients who received  xxxd2235xxx  (1000
mg/day for 48 weeks) [2p = 0.006].[120] indeed, a meta analysis
of 26 published articles reported that  xxxd3314xxx  produced a disease-free toenail (normal-appearing nail plus mycologic cure) in
am j clin dermatol 2003; 4 (1)

 xxxd3314xxx 

approximately 35 to 50% of patients.[124] these data were confirmed in a critical review of the long-term efficacy of antifungals
that indicated that  xxxd3314xxx  was the most effective agent.[125]
meta-analysis data published as part of two pharmacoeconomic
evaluations (section 6) found that  xxxd3314xxx  achieved a mycologic cure rate of 74% (95% ci 60.2 to 87.7%)[126] and 80.2%.[127]
this section of the review describes the clinical efficacy of
 xxxd3314xxx  and the comparator agents itraconazole and fluconazole
in patients with a positive diagnosis for onychomycosis caused
by dermatophytes. all trials were double-blind and doubledummy, with the exception of one single-blind study.[128] consistent with the epidemiologic data presented in section 2.2, most
infections (>80%) were caused by t. rubrum. most studies focused on toenail mycosis.
4.1.1 comparisons with azole agents

the efficacy of  xxxd3314xxx  in phase iii trials is summarized
in table ii. although  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day was constant
throughout the trials, investigators have assessed itraconazole as
an intermittent (400 mg/day for 1 week repeated every 4 weeks)
or continuous (200 mg/day for 12 weeks) dosage regimen. the
duration of treatment for each drug was 12 or 16 weeks. randomized, double-blind trials have shown oral  xxxd3314xxx  to be more
effective than intermittent or continuous itraconazole and
fluconazole (150 mg/week for 12 or 24 weeks) in dermatophyte
onychomycosis of the toenails. importantly, the complete, mycologic and clinical cure rates of  xxxd3314xxx  continued to increase
after the completion of therapy.
comparisons with intermittent itraconazole

the lamisil® vs itraconazole in onychomycosis (l.i.on.)
study found  xxxd3314xxx  (administered for 12 or 16 weeks) to be
more effective than intermittent itraconazole (3 or 4 cycles of 400
mg/day for 1 week repeated every 4 weeks) in the treatment of
toenail mycosis.[129] the trial involved 35 centers in six european
countries (finland, germany, iceland, italy, the netherlands and
the uk) and had a follow-up period of 72 weeks. for all patients,
the mean number of infected toenails at baseline was 5.8 (sd 2.8)
and the mean percentage of target nail involvement was 70.4%
(sd 26.6%). the mean duration of the current disease episode
was 10.6 years (sd 9.5 years). these baseline demographics were
equivalent across all four treatment groups.
at follow-up, complete cure rates (p ≤ 0.0044) and mycologic cure rates (p < 0.0001) were approximately twice as high
for  xxxd3314xxx  regimens compared with the itraconazole regimens (table ii).[129] in addition, both  xxxd3314xxx  groups had
higher clinical cure rates than those of the itraconazole groups [54
vs 32% (12-week regimens) and 60 vs 32% (16-week regimens),
all p ≤ 0.0022]. the clinical effectiveness (mycologic cure plus

≥5mm of new, clear toenail growth) of both  xxxd3314xxx  regimens
were also superior to each of the itraconazole regimens [66 vs
28% (12-week regimens) and 71 vs 34% (16-week regimens), all
p < 0.0001]. the l.i.on. study found that the rates of complete,
mycologic and clinical cures continued to increase beyond week
48 in the  xxxd3314xxx  groups but not in the itraconazole groups. in
terms of global assessment, considerably more physicians and
patients scored the  xxxd3314xxx  therapy as good or very good compared with itraconazole therapy. this result is supported by a
multicenter, open-label study that found a greater ease and convenience of treatment score (80.3 ± 1.4 vs 73.5 ± 2.0, p = 0.008)
as well as greater overall patient satisfaction score (80.6 ± 2.3 vs
68.5 ± 3.2, p = 0.003) in the  xxxd3314xxx  group than in the
itraconazole group.[137] there was no statistically significant difference in patient compliance between the two groups.
the 5-year blinded l.i.on. icelandic extension study[130]
(l.i.on.i.e.s.) demonstrated that  xxxd3314xxx  was more effective
than itraconazole in treating toenail mycosis. the trial involved
three centers in iceland and followed-up the icelandic population
of the original l.i.on. trial[129] from month 18 onwards. the
median duration of follow-up was 54 months (range 8 to 58
months). the mean percentage of nail involvement was 77 and
76% in the  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole groups, respectively. epidemiologic outcomes were calculated using the intention-totreat study population as the denominator. the primary endpoint
was mycologic cure (microscopy and culture) at follow-up without the requirement of secondary intervention. the secondary
endpoint was clinical cure without secondary intervention, and
mycologic and clinical relapse rates. a mycologic relapse was
defined as a patient who had achieved mycologic cure at month
12, but became mycologically positive at any timepoint thereafter. a clinical relapse was defined as a patient who achieved clinical cure at month 18 but showed clinical signs of infection at any
timepoint thereafter.
because of the smaller number of patients at the start of the
extension study (at 18 months follow-up), the populations within
the  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole groups were merged to give a
two-armed study. the similar cure rates at 18 months for each
 xxxd3314xxx  group and each itraconazole group justified the decision (table ii).[129]
at the end of follow-up, the  xxxd3314xxx  group had considerably higher complete (35 vs 14% of patients; p < 0.005), mycologic (46 vs 13%; p < 0.001) and clinical (42 vs 18%; p < 0.002)
cure rates than the itraconazole group.[130] figure 7 portrays the
mycologic cure rates from month 18 to 54, which is influenced
by two simultaneous processes; the long-term therapeutic benefits of both drugs and their respective relapse rates. the mycologic cure rates increased between month 12 and month 18 in both

of 25) of patients originally treated with  xxxd3314xxx  and 77% (36
of 47) of those initially treated with itraconazole.
a retrospective analysis of the l.i.on.[129] and l.i.on. icelandic extension study found several prognostic factors that influence mycological cure at 72 weeks.[130,138] compared with
negative cultures at week 12 and 24, respectively, positive cultures approximately doubled and tripled the odds of mycological
failure at week 72. patients who had positive microscopy at week
24 were approximately three times more likely than those with a
negative microscopy to be mycological failures at week 72.
the results of the 4-year blinded l.i.on. finnish extension
study[131] support the findings of the icelandic extension
study.[130] namely,  xxxd3314xxx  for 16 weeks was more effective
than  xxxd3314xxx  for 12 weeks and both itraconazole treatment

regimens (table ii). unlike the icelandic extension study, the
finnish study did not combine data sets. although the results
support the findings of the l.i.on.i.e.s., the data were collected
from small sample sizes and any treatment differences cannot be
considered as statistically robust.
an randomized, single-blind study showed similar response
rates with  xxxd3314xxx  (administered for 12 weeks) and intermittent itraconazole (3 cycles of 400 mg/day for 1 week repeated
every 4 weeks) for toenail mycosis in patients >60 (mean 68)
years of age (table ii).[128] clinical efficacy was observed in 31
of 50 patients receiving  xxxd3314xxx  (62.0%, 95% ci 55.1 to
68.9%) compared with 31 of 51 patients receiving itraconazole
(60.8%, 95% ci 53.9 to 67.6%). risk factors for poor prognosis
included total dystrophic nails or greater than 70% disease involvement, lateral onychomycosis, thickened nail plate (>2mm),
longitudinal spike and dermatophytoma. fewer  xxxd3314xxx  patients (26%) than itraconazole patients (45%) received an extra 4

than a double-blind study like those discussed above.
comparisons with continuous itraconazole

table ii shows a wide range of mycologic and complete cure
rates for each antimycotic that can be explained by the variable
durations of treatment and follow-up. of the two trials[133,134] that
reported complete cure rates at follow-up, only one comparison
achieved statistical significance and was in favor of  xxxd3314xxx  (37.7
vs 23.2%, p = 0.004, 95% ci of difference 4.62 to 24.3%).[133]
at follow-up,  xxxd3314xxx  demonstrated higher mycologic
cure rates than continuous itraconazole (200 mg/day) across three
randomized, double-blind trials[132,133,135] but a fourth[134] failed
to reach statistical significance. at follow-up, the range of mycologic cure rates for  xxxd3314xxx  was 56 to 95% compared with 46
to 84% for itraconazole. as expected, the percentage of patients
with negative culture was higher than the percentage with negative microscopy for both treatments.[133,134]  xxxd3314xxx  demonstrated higher rates of negative microscopy (77.9 vs 55.4%, p <
0.0001) and negative culture (84.0 vs 64.3%, p < 0.0001) than
itraconazole.[133] the mean time taken to achieve negative culture
for the  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole groups was, respectively, 8.5
(sd 6.6) and 11.6 (sd 9.1) weeks (2p < 0.05).[132] the rate of
reinfection was 1.6% (1 of 64 patients) and 1.4% (1 of 70) in the
 xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole groups, respectively.[135]
when minimal symptoms or clinical improvement were factored in to the global clinical evaluation, an advantage in favor of
 xxxd3314xxx  was reported by de backer et al.[133] (76.2 vs 58.1%,
p = 0.001, 95% ci of difference 8.2 to 27.9%) and honeyman et
al.[135] (96.9 vs 82.8%, p < 0.02). however, degreef et al.[134]
could not detect a statistically significant difference between  xxxd3314xxx  (38.9%) and itraconazole (42.8%) for the global clinical
evaluation.
although  xxxd3314xxx  markedly improved the signs and
symptoms of disease activity,[132-135] this parameter alone proved
insensitive in differentiating between the two drugs. nevertheless,  xxxd3314xxx  (vs itraconazole) reduced mean global symptom
scores from 5.8 to 1.9 (vs 5.5 to 2.2)[132] and produced clinical
cure rates of 57.8% (vs 62.9%)[135] at follow-up. in particular,
both drugs improved onycholysis by ≈80%[134] with one study
reporting that  xxxd3314xxx  caused a greater improvement than
itraconazole for this clinical feature (raw data not reported, p =
0.001).[133]
growth in the length of unaffected nail at follow-up (figure
8) was greater with  xxxd3314xxx  than itraconazole in two[132,133] of
the three[135] studies. interestingly, de backer et al.[133] reported
that their results were statistically significant for the big toenail
only and not for the small target nails. the area of nail plate

creased by the end of follow-up in both treatment groups.[132,134]
in particular, the mean percentage area per nail was reduced from
44 to 9% in the  xxxd3314xxx  group compared with a fall of 53 to
13% in the itraconazole group.[134] in the same study, the mean
number of affected nails fell from 5.2 to 1.3 and 5.3 to 1.7 in the
 xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole groups, respectively.
comparisons with fluconazole

to date, one randomized, double-blind study has compared
the efficacy of  xxxd3314xxx  (administered for 12 weeks) with
fluconazole (150 mg/week for 12 or 24 weeks) [table ii].[136] this
trial was conducted in six centers in finland over a period of 60
weeks. patients with mycologically confirmed toenail or fingernail mycosis were eligible for treatment.
at follow-up, complete (p < 0.0001) and mycologic cure
rates (p < 0.001) were considerably higher in the  xxxd3314xxx 
group than in the fluconazole groups (table ii). in addition, the
length of unaffected nail growth in the  xxxd3314xxx  group continued to increase throughout the study in the  xxxd3314xxx  group but
not in the fluconazole groups. unaffected nail growth started to
recede at week 24 in patients who received fluconazole for 12
weeks and at week 36 in patients who received fluconazole for
24 weeks. at follow-up, the length of unaffected nail growth in
the  xxxd3314xxx  group was 7.5mm compared with 3.5 and 5.0mm
in the fluconazole 12- and 24-week groups, respectively (estimated from graph). interestingly, considerably fewer patients in
the  xxxd3314xxx  group (11%) than in the fluconazole groups (39
and 56%) showed no signs of clinical improvement.
4.1.2 in patients with diabetes or immunocompromised patients

table iii summarizes the results of several small, noncomparative trials of  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day for 6 to 16 weeks in
patients with aids[139] or who were hiv positive,[140] had diabetes mellitus[141-143] or had received a renal transplant.[144] outcomes were variable, with mycologic cure rates at follow-up (20
to 72 weeks) ranging from 30 to 89% (table iii), clinical cure rates
ranging from 37 to 81% (table iii) and healthy nail growth was
an additional 6.4 to 9mm from baseline.
the lowest mycologic cure rate (30%) was obtained in a
small sample (n = 10) of caucasian men who were hiv positive.[140] in an abstract report, clinical and mycologic cure rates
and relapse rates at week 72 were statistically equivalent in patients with or without diabetes mellitus.[142] mycologic cure rates
for fingernail and toenail were identical at follow-up (table iii)
in patients with renal transplants, although the number of patients
in the fingernail mycosis group was small (n = 7).[144]
although these results suggest that  xxxd3314xxx  may be effective in these patient groups, the sample sizes are too small and the
study design insufficient to make reliable conclusions.

4.2 in yeast and non-dermatophyte mold infections

 xxxd3314xxx  is not as well studied in onychomycosis involving non-dermatophytes. there has been one randomized, doubleblind study published to date as well as several small and/or noncomparative trials. the most frequent causes of nail mycoses
were the yeasts c. albicans and c. parapsilosis and the mold s.
brevicaulis.
an early randomized, double-blind trial (n = 27) found that
treatment with  xxxd3314xxx  for 12 weeks offered no statistically
significant advantage over placebo in chronic paronychia or candida onychomycosis.[145] few patients had a mycologic cure and
most improvements were subjective changes in signs and symptoms of disease activity. however, a larger, randomized, placebocontrolled study (n = 97) found that  xxxd3314xxx  for 12 and 24
weeks produced a complete cure in, respectively, 12 of 31 (39%)
and 13 of 33 (39%) patients with candidal and nondermatophyte
onychomycosis at week 96.[146] in contrast, placebo for 24 weeks
produced a complete cure in 0 of 32 patients at follow-up. similarly, the  xxxd3314xxx  12- and 24-week regimens produced higher
mycologic cure rates (74 and 73%) than placebo (23%).
a noncomparative, multicenter study conducted in germany
(n = 65) assessed the effectiveness of a 48-week treatment course of
 xxxd3314xxx  in patients with distal subungual onychomycosis of the
fingernails and/or toenails caused by yeasts and non-dermatophyte

molds.[147] at the end of the treatment phase, cure rates (clinical
plus mycologic) of 52% (24 of 46) were achieved in the toenail
group compared with 65% (17 of 26) in the fingernail group. also
at the end of treatment, 74% (34 of 46) of toenail and 77% (20 of
26) of fingernail infections were mycologically cured. in particular,  xxxd3314xxx  produced a mycologic cure rate in, respectively,
70, 85 and 43% of c. albicans, c. parapsilosis and s. brevicaulis
infections. of the 33 toenail cases and 17 fingernail cases that
were followed-up 6 months after completing therapy, 63 and 85%
of cases remained virtually or completely cured, respectively.
in a noncomparative study conducted in israel involving 20
evaluable patients with candida nail infections, a 16-week course
of  xxxd3314xxx  produced a complete cure of the target nail in 12
patients at the 48-week follow-up.[148] a mycologic cure with
marked improvement (>90% improvement) was observed in two
patients and five showed moderate improvement (>50% to <90%).
there was one treatment failure (<50% improvement). overall,
58 of 75 (77%) infected fingernails and 85 of 126 (67.5%) infected toenails were cured.
5. tolerability
5.1 clinical trials

clinical trials have also shown oral  xxxd3314xxx  to be well
tolerated. pooled data from three placebo-controlled trials are
illustrated in figure 9.[149]  xxxd3314xxx  was not only more effective
in treating onychomycosis than  xxxd2235xxx  but also associated
with fewer adverse events (11 vs 29%).[122]
adverse events data from the l.i.on. study[129] suggested
that both continuous  xxxd3314xxx  and intermittent itraconazole
treatment regimens (table ii) had similar tolerability profiles.
similarly, continuous  xxxd3314xxx  and intermittent itraconazole
were well tolerated in a trial involving elderly patients.[128] in this
trial, all adverse events were mild and reversible. adverse events
were reported in 5 of 50 and 8 of 52 patients who received  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole, respectively. all trial participants completed follow-up.
although the absolute incidence of adverse events associated
with continuous  xxxd3314xxx  and continuous itraconazole varied
across trials, the relative incidence of adverse events within each
trial were similar for both drugs.[132-134] for example, bräutigam
et al.[132] estimated that the adverse events rate that was probably
related to  xxxd3314xxx  (n = 81) was 6% compared with 9% for
itraconazole (n = 78). three  xxxd3314xxx  patients and four
itraconazole patients withdrew from this study because of adverse
events. one patient in each group withdrew because of increases
in liver enzyme activity; two patients from each group withdrew

56

darkes et al.

because of gastrointestinal complaints; and one patient in the
itraconazole group withdrew because of paresthesia.
the frequency and severity of adverse events did not appear
to differ between patients who received  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day
for 12 weeks) and those who received fluconazole (150 mg/week
for 12 or 24 weeks).[136] a total of 65 adverse events were reported
in the  xxxd3314xxx  (n = 48) group compared with 90 and 75 events
in the fluconazole 12-week (n = 45) and 24-week (n = 44) groups,
respectively. one of the three  xxxd3314xxx  recipients who experienced transient taste disturbance withdrew from the study. in the
fluconazole 12-week group, one patient withdrew because of constipation and depression. in the fluconazole 24-week group, one
patient withdrew because of a raised serum  xxxg941xxx  level and one withdrew because of nausea and diarrhea.
one of 21 patients with aids receiving  xxxd3314xxx  developed a moderate gastric pain[139] and 1 of 17 patients who were
hiv-positive discontinued  xxxd3314xxx  treatment after developing
a drug rash.[140] two of 32 patients with diabetes mellitus reported
three mild to moderate adverse events with  xxxd3314xxx  use.[141]
transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts have also
been reported in placebo-controlled clinical trials; the clinical
relevance of these decreases is unknown (see section 7).[149] in these
trials, 8 of 465 patients (1.7%) receiving  xxxd3314xxx  experienced
a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (<1000 cells/mm3) versus 2.2% (3 of 137 patients) of those in the placebo groups.[149]
5.2 postmarketing surveillance

the tolerability of oral, continuous  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day
(median treatment duration 12 weeks) in general medical practice
was assessed in four open, prospective, uncontrolled, postmarketing surveillance studies involving 25 884 patients with superficial mycoses.[101,102] the large number of patients in this study

allowed for the detection of rare (<1 in 1000 and >1 in 10 000
exposures)[102] adverse events associated with  xxxd3314xxx . the
causal relationship between adverse event and  xxxd3314xxx  was
assessed and classified according to the who definitions.[150,151]
the adverse events were reported by physicians from the four
participating countries. the percentage of patients who experienced adverse events was 10.5%; 4.9, 2.3 and 3.3% of patients
experienced gastrointestinal, dermatologic and other events, respectively. slightly more than half (55.9%) of all adverse events
were considered by investigators to be possibly or probably related to  xxxd3314xxx  treatment. the adverse events tended to be
reversible. the most common gastrointestinal complaints were
nausea (1.3% of patients), diarrhea (0.8%), abdominal pain (0.8%)
and dyspepsia (0.6%). the most common skin complaints were
rash (0.9% of patients), pruritus (0.3%), urticaria (0.3%) and eczema (0.2%). the study also reported adverse events involving
the central nervous system (primarily headache) [1.2% of patients],
respiratory system (1.0%) and musculoskeletal system (0.8%).
perversion of taste (0.4% of patients) usually occurred during the
first week of therapy and loss of taste (0.3%) tended to appear
after 4 to 8 weeks. taste loss was experienced twice as often in
women as in men.[101]
of the 5890 patients aged 60 years or over, 756 (12.8%)
experienced 1039 adverse events of which 52.8% were probably
or possibly related to  xxxd3314xxx . the overall incidence rate and
profile of adverse events in the elderly were similar to those of
the general study population. a total of 65 serious adverse events
were experienced by 59 (1.0%) elderly patients but only three
events were considered by the investigators to be possibly or
probably related to  xxxd3314xxx  treatment.[101]
the study detected very rare adverse events (<1 in 10 000
exposures) including two (0.008%) cases each of severe rash (toxi-

coderma and erythema multiforme) and cholestatic hepatic dysfunction.[102] two cases of reversible thrombocytopenia developed that were considered to be possibly related to  xxxd3314xxx .
the estimated incidence of severe neutropenia, including agranulocytosis, is 1 in 400 000 patients receiving  xxxd3314xxx  but less
severe forms may be more common.[152] numerous case reports
of adverse events involving  xxxd3314xxx  (and itraconazole and
fluconazole) therapy have been elegantly reviewed by gupta and
shear,[102] and suhonen and neuvonen.[152] in most instances of
liver dysfunction reported in association with  xxxd3314xxx  use, the
patients had serious underlying systemic conditions and the event
had an uncertain causal relationship with the drug.[24] however,
very rare cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant,
have been reported in association with  xxxd3314xxx  treatment.[149]
postmarketing surveillance[101] found that approximately
half of those who reported adverse events terminated  xxxd3314xxx 
treatment prematurely (5.3% of patients). treatment terminations
were primarily due to gastrointestinal disorders (2.7% of patients). there were 24 (0.09%) deaths during the study; none were
considered to be related to  xxxd3314xxx  treatment.
6. pharmacoeconomic considerations
numerous and extensive economic evaluations[153-159] of
antimycotic treatment in dermatophyte onychomycosis suggest

that oral  xxxd3314xxx  is more cost effective than itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx  (reviewed by joish and
armstrong[16]).
using a model based on the clinical results of the multinational l.i.on. study,[129]  xxxd3314xxx  was more cost effective than
intermittent itraconazole for the treatment of dermatophyte toenail mycosis.[153] only direct medical costs for each of the four
treatment arms (section 4.1.1 and table ii) were assessed; therefore, the analyses were performed from a healthcare system perspective. treatment effectiveness was measured in terms of the
complete cure rate and the number of disease-free days over 72
weeks. treatment costs were recorded for each patient and included routine medical management (e.g. laboratory tests, drug
costs), adverse events, treatment failure and disease relapse. of
note, adverse events data did not include patients who received
comedications that are known to interact with itraconazole.
therefore, the tolerability comparison was skewed in favor of
itraconazole. the cost of each antimycotic treatment regimen was
calculated using retail prices (1998 costs) in the six participating
countries (finland, germany, iceland, italy, the netherlands and
the uk). because the treatment of onychomycosis was similar in
the six countries with respect to their overall medical resource
consumption, calculating the costs depended only on applying
country-specific cost estimates to the data. the estimates were
am j clin dermatol 2003; 4 (1)

58

based upon expert opinion and input from l.i.on. study investigators. cost-effectiveness point estimates and confidence intervals were calculated using a repeated resampling (bootstrap)
method.[153]
the mean treatment costs per patient for  xxxd3314xxx  (250
mg/day for 12 weeks) were lower than the costs for intermittent
itraconazole (three cycles of 400 mg/day for 1 week repeated
every 4 weeks) in all countries except finland. compared with
the costs associated with 16-week intermittent itraconazole, the
costs associated with 16-week continuous  xxxd3314xxx  were similar in four countries (iceland, italy, the netherlands and the uk),
lower in germany and higher in finland. routine medical management costs of onychomycosis were similar for both drugs but
intermittent itraconazole was associated with increased costs due
to treatment failures and disease relapses. the acquisition cost of
each antimycotic was the single largest contributor of all routine
medical management and treatment failure management costs.[153]
not only did  xxxd3314xxx  patients achieve higher complete
cure rates than intermittent itraconazole (table ii), they also averaged more disease-free days (12-week regimens, 95.7 vs 55.5
days; 16-week regimens 114.8 vs 58.5 days). therefore, the
greater clinical effectiveness of  xxxd3314xxx  coupled with similar
routine medical management costs ensured that it was a more
cost-effective option. in all countries except finland, the 12-week
 xxxd3314xxx  course was the cheapest option and its cost-per-patient-cured ratio was indexed at 1.0. this reference value showed
that the 12- and 16-week  xxxd3314xxx  treatment regimens had a
lower average cost-per-patient-cured ratio than the corresponding
itraconazole regimens (all p < 0.05). furthermore, the average costper-patient-cured ratio was lower for the 16-week  xxxd3314xxx  regimen than the 12-week itraconazole regimen in all countries except finland (p < 0.05).
in all six countries, the cost-per-patient-cured ratios for the
 xxxd3314xxx  regimens were statistically equivalent. although the
16-week  xxxd3314xxx  regimen was more clinically effective than
the 12-week regimen, the additional costs were not offset by the
additional benefits, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio of eur1674 per additional complete cure (or eur8.2 per
additional disease-free day). sensitivity analysis showed that  xxxd3314xxx  remained more cost effective than itraconazole despite
increasing the number of physician visits or laboratory tests by
>300%.[153]
using the pharmacoeconomic analysis model (pecan), a
13-country cost-effectiveness study found that  xxxd3314xxx  was
the most cost-effective option for the treatment of both fingernail
and toenail mycosis in all 13 countries, whereas  xxxd2235xxx  was
the least cost effective (table iv).[154] the study was conducted
from a government payer perspective and the model used a clin© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

darkes et al.

ical decision analysis tool to represent the outcomes associated
with onychomycosis treatment. worldwide meta-analyses of clinical data were used as pharmacoeconomic model inputs. the expected cost-of-therapy analysis included the cost-of-regimen
analysis (e.g. drug acquisition and administration costs) and the
event rate probabilities of fungal nail disease sequelae (e.g. success and relapse rates). the drug therapy with the lowest costs per
disease free days (i.e.  xxxd3314xxx ) was given a ratio of 1 and the
ratios for the comparator agents were determined against this
value ($us; year of costing not reported).
the findings of the multinational study were supported by a
us study,[155] which used similar methodology. from a thirdparty payer perspective, the us study demonstrated that  xxxd3314xxx  had the lowest cost per mycologic cure after one treatment
regimen for both toenail ($us791) and fingernail ($us454) infections. the costs of treating toenail (and fingernail) mycosis for
the comparator drugs were as follows: itraconazole $us1535
($us767);  xxxd2235xxx  $us2385 ($us837); and ketoconazole
$us10 025 ($us1512). furthermore,  xxxd3314xxx  had the lowest
overall expected cost per patient for both toenail and fingernail
mycosis (us$977 and us$550, respectively) compared with
itraconazole ($us1588 and $us894),  xxxd2235xxx  ($us1543 and
$us822) and ketoconazole ($us2359 and $us1287). however,
the year in which costs were valued were not reported.
the base-case analysis of a more recent us study, which also
used meta-analysis of clinical data as pharmacoeconomic model
inputs, found that intermittent itraconazole had the lowest cost
per mycologic cure ($us991) from a third-party payer perspective [1997 values].[126]  xxxd3314xxx  had the second lowest cost per
mycologic cure ($us1125) followed by fluconazole ($us1506),
continuous itraconazole ($us1877) and  xxxd2235xxx  ($us8089).
the respective cost per symptom-free days in rank order were as
follows: intermittent itraconazole $us1.26;  xxxd3314xxx  $us1.28;
fluconazole $us2.12; continuous itraconazole $us2.18; and
 xxxd2235xxx  $us7.05.[126] the base-case analysis of a german
study (of similar methodology) also found that intermittent
itraconazole (dm1107 per successful treatment) had a modestly
lower cost-effectiveness ratio than  xxxd3314xxx  (dm1224 per successful treatment) from a healthcare payer perspective.[127] the
year in which costs were valued was not reported. however, unlike the other studies, both of these economic evaluations used
meta-analysis data showing intermittent itraconazole to be of
similar efficacy to  xxxd3314xxx , which is not consistent with the
l.i.on. study (section 4.1.1).[129-131] furthermore sensitivity
analyses indicated that the cost-effectiveness ratios for  xxxd3314xxx  or intermittent itraconazole were similar.[127]

pharmacoeconomic analysis, the drug therapy with the lowest costs per disease free days (i.e.  xxxd3314xxx ) was given a ratio of 1 and the ratios for the
comparators were determined against this value ($us; year of costing not reported).[154] the lower the cost-effectiveness ratio, the more effective the therapy
is in relation to costs. all values were estimated from a graph

studies[132,133] (see section 4.1.1 and table ii) found that  xxxd3314xxx 
250 mg/day was more cost effective than continuous itraconazole
200 mg/day in patients with toenail onychomycosis.[156] the total
cost of  xxxd3314xxx  therapy ranged from $us697.55 to 699.11
compared with $us1216.40 to 1218.80 for itraconazole therapy.
relative to  xxxd3314xxx , which was assigned a cost-effectiveness
ratio of 1.0, the cost-effectiveness ratio of itraconazole in the two
studies were 1.62[132] and 1.58.[133]

 xxxd3314xxx  hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail due to derm© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

atophytes (tinea unguium)[24] and for the treatment of other superficial mycoses (including tinea pedis, cruris and corporis)
when considered appropriate (reviewed by mcclellan et al.[29]).
the usual adult dosage of  xxxd3314xxx  for the treatment of
tinea unguium of the fingernail and toenail is 250 mg/day for 6
and 12 weeks, respectively.[24] in most countries,  xxxd3314xxx  is not
licensed to treat onychomycosis in children because its efficacy and
tolerability has not been established in this patient group. there is
no evidence to suggest that dosage adjustment is required in the
elderly. however, a dosage adjustment may be required in patients who receive concomitant cimetidine or rifampicin (section
3.5).

fingernails are usually re-evaluated 18 weeks or longer, and
toenails are re-evaluated 6 to 9 months or longer, after completion of therapy. the optimal clinical benefit is observed some
months after the completion of treatment and corresponds to the
time required for healthy nail outgrowth.[24] some patients may
benefit from extended and/or repeated courses of  xxxd3314xxx  therapy.[160]
before  xxxd3314xxx  is prescribed, liver function should be assessed and serum transaminase levels should be measured. patients should be warned to report immediately to their physician
any symptoms of liver disease (e.g. persistent nausea, anorexia,
fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark
urine or pale stools). treatment with  xxxd3314xxx  should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of hepatic injury
develops. the severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome
may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease and
 xxxd3314xxx  is not recommended in these patients. in addition,
 xxxd3314xxx  has not been adequately studied in patients with renal
dysfunction [creatinine clearance ≤3 l/h (or 50 ml/min)].[24]
 xxxd3314xxx  is also associated with transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (section 5.1).[149] therefore, physicians
should consider monitoring full blood counts in patients with
known or suspected immunodeficiency who take  xxxd3314xxx  for
longer than 6 weeks. because isolated cases of severe neutropenia
have been reported with  xxxd3314xxx  therapy, a full blood count
should be obtained if there are clinical signs and symptoms of
secondary infection. if the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3,
 xxxd3314xxx  should be discontinued and supportive management
started.[24]
 xxxd3314xxx  hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to  xxxd3314xxx  or any ingredient within
the formulation. if progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with
 xxxd3314xxx  should be discontinued.  xxxd3314xxx  is classed arbitrarily
in pregnancy category b. although animal studies have revealed
no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus,  xxxd3314xxx 
treatment for tinea unguium should be postponed until after pregnancy is complete.  xxxd3314xxx  therapy should also be avoided in
nursing mothers because of the presence of the drug in breast
milk.[24]
there are only limited data regarding overdosage with  xxxd3314xxx . up to 5g (20 times the therapeutic daily dose) of  xxxd3314xxx  has been ingested without inducing serious adverse reactions. the clinical signs and symptoms of overdosage include
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, frequent urination and headache.[24]

8. place of  xxxd3314xxx  in the management
of onychomycosis
once a diagnosis of onychomycosis has been confirmed, it
is important to consider the cost effectiveness of treatment.[161]
traditional management of onychomycosis, which included mechanical, chemical and/or surgical intervention,[13] was short in
duration but associated with a high probability of failure.[161] topical preparations such as  xxxd3380xxx  28% w/v solution and
amorolfine 5% w/v nail varnish may be used for early, mild onychomycosis in up to two nails but only when less than half of the
nail plate is involved and when the nail bed is minimally affected.[161] however, topical therapies have been disappointing in
tinea unguium, particularly when nails are severely affected.[162]
until 1991, oral  xxxd2235xxx  500 mg/day and oral ketoconazole 200 mg/day for 4 to 6 months (fingernails) or for 10 to 18
months (toenails) were the agents of choice in onychomycosis.[13]
 xxxd2235xxx  therapy, in particular, has a long treatment duration
and is characterized by limited efficacy, high disease relapse rates
and numerous drug interactions.[163,164] however, unlike  xxxd3314xxx ,  xxxd2235xxx  is licensed for use to treat children with onychomycosis.[165] ketoconazole therapy is also associated with numerous
drug interactions as well as rare but severe hepatotoxicity.[166]
over the last 10 years,  xxxd3314xxx [113-116] and the triazole
itraconazole[167] have proved more effective than the traditional
treatment regimens. randomized, placebo-controlled trial data,
which were supported by nail  xxxd3314xxx  kinetic data (section
3.2),[88,89] showed  xxxd3314xxx  250 mg/day for 6 weeks (fingernails) or 12 weeks (toenails) to be the optimum dosage regimen.
not only was  xxxd3314xxx  more clinically efficacious than
 xxxd2235xxx  for dermatophyte onychomycosis,[120-122] its better
tolerability profile and relatively short treatment duration improved patient compliance. a subsequent meta-analysis of 26
published articles reported that  xxxd3314xxx  produced a diseasefree toenail (normal-appearing nail plus mycologic cure) in approximately 35 to 50% of patients compared with 25 to 40% of
itraconazole recipients.[124]
comparative data have clearly shown oral  xxxd3314xxx  (250
mg/day for 12 weeks) to be more effective than intermittent (3 or
4 cycles of 400 mg/day for 1 week every 4 weeks) or continuous
(200 mg/day) itraconazole and fluconazole (150 mg/week for 12
or 24 weeks) in dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toenails (section 4.1.1). importantly, the l.i.on. study[129] found that the rates
of complete, mycologic and clinical cures continued to increase
after the completion of therapy in the  xxxd3314xxx  groups but not
in the itraconazole groups. these data are supported by results
from a meta analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials indicating that mycological cure rates at 11 and 12 months favored
continuous treatment with  xxxd3314xxx  (250 mg/day for 12 weeks)
am j clin dermatol 2003; 4 (1)

 xxxd3314xxx 

versus that with continuous itraconazole (200 mg/day for 12
weeks) [risk difference –0.23; 95% confidence intervals –0.32 to
–0.15].[168]
furthermore, the 5-year blinded l.i.on. icelandic extension
study[130] demonstrated that  xxxd3314xxx  produced greater rates of
complete cure, mycologic cure and clinical cure than intermittent
itraconazole (section 4.1.1). at follow-up, the mycologic and clinical
relapse rates were considerably lower in the  xxxd3314xxx  group
compared with the itraconazole group. because onychomycosis
is a long-term, difficult-to-treat disease, these results not only
confirm the greater clinical efficacy of  xxxd3314xxx  but also confirm its greater therapeutic effectiveness in the community setting. importantly, of the patients who received  xxxd3314xxx  as secondary intervention after an initial treatment with  xxxd3314xxx  or
itraconazole, 72% of both groups had a complete cure.
one cause of treatment failure may be the biological status
of the fungi.[32] patients who do not respond to an additional
treatment course of  xxxd3314xxx  or itraconazole may require more
individualized management (e.g. ‘boosted oral antifungal therapy’ and ‘boosted antifungal topical therapy’).[50] these therapies
involve a topical application of a piece of sabouraud’s agar to
transform resting fungal cells (arthroconidia) into growing hyphae, which are more sensitive to the static and  xxxd3440xxx  effects of
antimycotic agents.  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole have shown
synergistic antifungal activity in vitro[69] against yeast (section
2.2). limited data suggest that  xxxd3314xxx  has good efficacy in
immunocompromised patients, those with diabetes mellitus and
patients with renal transplants.
although  xxxd3314xxx  is the treatment of choice in tinea unguium, intermittent or continuous itraconazole is preferred in onychomycosis caused by yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds.[3,170] a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with nondermatophyte and mixed nondermatophyte toenail onychomycosis demonstrated that  xxxd3314xxx  for 24 weeks was no more effective than a 12-week course and that both  xxxd3314xxx  regimens
were more effective than placebo.[146] itraconazole is also the agent
of choice in more extensive mixed nail infections.[3] however,
only a small proportion of fungal nail infections are caused by
organisms other than dermatophytes (see section 2.2 and figure
4). comparative data involving patients with both types of infection are required to assess the relative clinical efficacies of both
agents.
 xxxd3314xxx , itraconazole and fluconazole have good tolerability profiles. accurate comparisons of adverse effects data
between  xxxd3314xxx , itraconazole and fluconazole are difficult
but limited comparative data indicate equivalent tolerabilities.[128,129,132-134,136] the percentage of patients receiving  xxxd3314xxx  who experienced adverse events was 10.5% in a large

post marketing surveillance study.[101] similarly, a prescriptionevent monitoring study involving 13 645 recipients of itraconazole
found that the drug had an excellent tolerability profile.[171] indeed, most adverse events associated with itraconazole treatment
were caused by the primary fungal infection. all three antimycotics have been associated with rare incidences of serious liver
problems.[101,165,172] with respect to  xxxd3314xxx  and itraconazole,
there are insufficient data at present to compare their hepatotoxicity profiles.[173] the us food and drug administration states
that there is a small but real risk of developing congestive heart
failure associated with the use of itraconazole.[173] accordingly,
itraconazole should not be administered for the treatment of onychomycosis in patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction.[174]
itraconazole and fluconazole have been associated with
drug-drug interactions that, to date, have not been reported for
 xxxd3314xxx  (section 3.5). the coadministration of itraconazole
with  xxxd236xxx  or terfenadine (unlicensed in the us) is contraindicated because of the rare incidence of adverse cardiovascular
events. the azoles not only have a high binding affinity for fungal
cyp enzyme-dependent 14alpha-demethylase (section 2.1) but also
bind to other cyp enzymes in the liver to a clinically significant
extent. in particular, itraconazole is metabolized via the cyp3a4
isoenzyme system (section 2.1). comedications that are substrates
for this enzyme will result in elevated plasma levels of those
medications, which has led to serious adverse events in some
cases. therefore,  xxxd1708xxx , oral midazolam,  xxxd2956xxx , quinidine,
dofetilide, triazolam and  xxxg1060xxx 
inhibitors (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin) are contraindicated with
itraconazole.[175] fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of cyp2c9.[94]
therefore, clinically significant drug interactions between
fluconazole and the sulfonylureas, phenytoin, warfarin, losartan
and cyclosporin have been reported, which may require therapeutic drug monitoring.[176]
most pharmacoeconomic evaluations have shown that the
greater clinical effectiveness of  xxxd3314xxx  in treating dermatophyte onychomycosis translates into a better cost-effectiveness than
itraconazole, fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx  (section 6). in particular, pharmacoeconomic analysis based on the clinical results of
the l.i.on. study[129] showed that  xxxd3314xxx  had a lower cost-perpatient-cured ratio and produced a greater number of disease-free
days than intermittent itraconazole despite the tolerability comparison being skewed in favor of itraconazole (1998 costs).[153]
conclusions:  xxxd3314xxx  has demonstrated greater effectiveness than itraconazole, fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx  in randomized trials involving patients with onychomycosis caused by
dermatophytes. the drug is generally well tolerated and has a low
potential for drug interactions. most multinational pharmacoeconomic evaluations indicate that  xxxd3314xxx  is a more cost-effective

option than itraconazole, fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx . therefore,
 xxxd3314xxx  is the treatment of choice for dermatophyte onychomycosis.
