surfactant is an apically-secreted surface-active material containing
primarily disaturated phosphatidylcholine (dsptdcho) that is released from alveolar epithelia into the alveolus. surfactant deficiency is an important aspect of inflammatory lung disease and
may result from extravasation of serum lipoproteins into the alveolus. we investigated whether one bioactive component of modified
lipoproteins, oxysterols, might reduce surfactant ptdcho availability by altering its trafficking. the oxysterol, 22-hydroxycholesterol
(22hc), in combination with its obligate partner, 9  xxxd2404xxx 
(ra), decreased surfactant ptdcho levels, in part, by stimulating
basolateral phospholipid export in murine lung epithelia. 22hc/
ra stimulated basolateral ptdcho efflux in cells via transcriptional
activation of the  xxxg9xxx  ( xxxg9xxx ) gene.
this effect was mediated by a  xxxg1057xxx  locus within the  xxxg9xxx  promoter.  xxxg9xxx  knockdown studies using  xxxg9xxx  sirna or the  xxxg9xxx 
inhibitor,  xxxd2215xxx , selectively attenuated 22hc/ra-driven basolateral ptdcho efflux. 22hc/ra significantly increased export of
ptdcho molecular species containing saturated (16:0) fatty-acyl species typical of dsptdcho. overexpression of  xxxg9xxx  mimicked 22hc/
ra effects by increasing cellular ptdcho efflux, whereas mutagenesis of  xxxg9xxx  at trp590 attenuated ptdcho release. the results indicate the existence of an oxysterol-activated basolateral exit pathway
for surfactant that might impact the availability of phospholipid
destined for apical secretion.

pulmonary surfactant is an essential mixture containing primarily disaturated phosphatidylcholine (dsptdcho) and key hydrophobic proteins that provide stability to alveoli by lowering
surface tension. surfactant is synthesized within polarized alveolar type ii epithelia and packaged within lamellar bodies, an
intracellular storage form of surfactant, before secretion into
the alveolar lumen via a well recognized apical secretory route.
deficiency of surfactant dsptdcho contributes to the pathogenesis of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a disorder characterized by leakage of serum proteins into the alveolus resulting
in severe respiratory compromise (1, 2). recent studies by us and
others suggest that cholesterol-enriched low-density lipoproteins
are important components of serum that accumulate in the alveolus, become oxidized, and have the ability to modify surfactant
biophysical activity or impair dsptdcho synthesis within alveolar type ii epithelia (3, 4).
oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol that are
important constituents of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl).

oxysterols are present in human lung and possess potent biological properties regulating diverse processes (5). oxysterols control expression of several lipogenic genes via binding to liver x
receptors (lxr), members of the nuclear receptor superfamily
(6). as a prerequisite for nuclear transduction of oxysterol signaling, lxr receptors form heterodimers with the obligate partner
9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rxr) that binds to lxr/rxr response elements within target genes (6).
one recognized target of lxr/rxr ligands is the atpbinding cassette transporter ( xxxg22xxx ) family of transmembrane proteins. the  xxxg9xxx 
( xxxg9xxx ) gene is oxysterol-regulated and involved in the efflux
of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol from the plasma membrane (7–9). transactivation of the  xxxg9xxx  promoter by lxr/
rxr ligands results in expression of the transporter within the
membrane triggering efflux of lipids to suitable acceptor proteins
such as  xxxg173xxx  and high-density lipoproteins (hdl) (10–12).
presumably lxr/rxr induction of  xxxg9xxx  functions as an
exquisite control mechanism to eliminate excess cellular lipids
in reverse cholesterol transport.
mutations within  xxxg9xxx  have been etiologically linked to
a severe hdl deficiency syndrome, tangier’s disease, a disorder
characterized by premature atherosclerosis, organomegaly, ocular disease, and extensive cellular deposition of cholesterol. although coexisting pulmonary disease has not been reported thus
far,  xxxg9xxx  knockout mice have prominent pulmonary pathology. these mice die from respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and widespread alveolar atelectasis. alveolar type ii
epithelial cells in  xxxg9xxx -deficient mice exhibit scant, aberrant
lamellar bodies with marked accumulation of lipid within type
ii cells (13). recently, another member of the abc family,
abca3, was identified within lamellar bodies of alveolar epithelia (14, 15). this suggests that abca3 might be involved in the
packaging of surfactant dsptdcho that is destined for apical
export into the alveolar lumen. however, the precise role of
abc transporters within these organelles, and perhaps more
importantly, the purported role of “reverse” or basolateral lipid
surfactant efflux in alveolar cells, is largely unknown. the identification of abc transporters in alveolar epithelia coupled with
phenotypic defects in murine models lacking  xxxg9xxx  led us to
hypothesize that this transporter might be involved in surfactant
pc trafficking.
in this study we investigated a surfactant phospholipid efflux
pathway in response to lxr/rxr ligands in alveolar epithelia.
we observed that lxr/rxr agonists diminish cellular ptdcho
levels, in part, by triggering  xxxg9xxx -mediated basolateral phospholipid efflux. cellular  xxxg9xxx  overexpression increased
ptdcho export, and lxr/rxr agonists led to the elimination
of ptdcho molecular species typical of surfactant. the data suggest that  xxxg9xxx  might serve as a regulatable lipid sensor involved in modulating overall surfactant lipid pool size in lung
epithelia.

cell culture
mle cells were maintained in hite’s medium with 2% fetal bovine
serum (fbs) at 37⬚c in atmosphere containing 5% co2. after reaching
70% confluence, the cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin with 0.1%
edta and plated onto either 12-well or 60-mm tissue culture dishes.
after incubation overnight, the medium was removed and the cells
rinsed three times with pbs, then incubated with hite’s medium alone
(control medium) or in combination with various amounts of 22hc (25
␮m) with or without 9-cis ra (1 ␮m) containing 20 ␮g/ml hdl or
 xxxg173xxx  (the ptdcho acceptor) for up to 24 h. in some studies, cells
were exposed to the  xxxg9xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2215xxx  (250 ␮m) for 1 h
before addition of 22hc and 9-cis ra. cells lysates were prepared by
brief sonication in buffer a (150 mm nacl, 50 mm tris, 1.0 mm
edta, 2 mm dtt, 0.025% sodium azide, 1 mm pmsf, ph 7.4) at 4⬚c.

detection of murine  xxxg9xxx  transcripts using real-time
pcr analysis
total cellular rna from mle cells was obtained using tri-reagent.
taqman reverse transcription reagents (applied biosystems) were used
to generate cdna from cellular rna. real-time pcr was then performed on cdna using the applied biosystems 7,700 real-time pcr
instrument and the sybr green pcr master mix.  xxxg9xxx  transcript
detection primers were: 5⬘-act agt gcc aag ttg ctc ag-3⬘, and 5⬘-ctg ggt
tag aga gat gca ca-3⬘. taqman rodent 18s was used as the internal
control using the following primers: 5⬘-taa gtc cct gcc ctt tgt aca ca-3⬘,
and 3⬘ primer 5⬘-gat ccg agg gcc tca cta aac-3⬘.

cloning of the human  xxxg9xxx  promoter
a 948-bp fragment of the proximal 5⬘ flanking sequence of human
 xxxg9xxx  (af275948, ⫺707/⫹241 [12]) was generated using pcr using
the sense primer: 5⬘-gac tcg agc agt aag atg ttc ctc tcg-3⬘ and antisense
primer: 5⬘-aga tct gtc act gga gag cct ctt acc-3⬘. the cloned fragment
included the proximal 5⬘ flanking region, transcription start sites and
up to 241 nt of the first exon, containing the tata box and the  xxxg1057xxx 
element (12). this fragment was purified and directionally cloned into
pcr4-topo, and plasmids mini-preps verified by dna sequencing;
the fragment was then directionally cloned into  xxxg2041xxx  basic using bglii/
kpni sites, generating  xxxg2041xxx -abca1948. a 644-bp human  xxxg9xxx  core
promoter fragment (af258623, ⫺618/⫹26 [17]) was also generated
using the same pcr procedure using the sense primer 5⬘-gac tcg agc
agt aag atg ttc ctc tcg-3⬘ and antisense primer 5⬘-aga tct tac tat cgg tca

region, the transcription start site, and up to 26 nt of the first exon
corresponding to the 5⬘ untranslated region of the human  xxxg9xxx 
transcript but lacked the  xxxg1057xxx  element (17).

cloning of murine  xxxg9xxx 

cells were cultured in hite’s medium (control medium), or medium
containing agonists for up to 24 h. total cellular lipids were extracted,
ptdcho resolved using thin layer chromatography (tlc), and ptdcho
mass was assayed by measuring lipid phosphorus content (16). for
ptdcho efflux, cells were cultured either in 60-mm dishes or plated at
a density of 90,000 cells within the upper chamber of 24-mm transwell
dishes for 3 d in hite’s medium containing 2% fbs to generate confluent
monolayers. cells were rinsed twice with serum-free hite’s medium
before pulsing cells with 1 ␮ci [methyl 3h]-choline chloride for 18 h in
the presence or absence of 22hc (25 ␮m) with 9-cis ra (1 ␮m) and
20 ␮g/ml of hdl for 24 h. lipids were extracted from medium in the
apical or basolateral compartment and processed for ptdcho analysis
using tlc and scintillation counting (3).

the cdna encoding the open reading frame (orf) for mouse  xxxg9xxx 
gene (ncbi accession no. nm013454) was generated using mouse liver
cdna as a template, using three sets of primers: for cloning of fragment
1, sense primer: 5-ggtaccgccatgccgtctgcaggaac-3 and antisense primer:
5-ggatccacccacgaaggccaag-3; for fragment 2, sense primer: 5-gggatgcaga
gaaagctgtctg-3 and antisense primer: 5-g acacgaggacgtcgacagagg-3; for
fragment 3, sense primer: 5-cctctgtcgacgtcctcgtgtc-3 and antisense
primer: 5-tctagacctttcattcaccctgtgtg-3 in a two-step pcr amplification
using advantage 2 cdna polymerase under the following reaction
conditions: 94⬚c 2 min; 94⬚c 30 s, 68⬚c 3 min, 25 cycles. amplification
resulted in generation of three pcr fragments, ⵑ 3 kb, ⵑ 1.8 kb, and
ⵑ 2 kb in size. these fragments were purified using the geneclean2
kit, cloned into pcr4-topo, and plasmids minipreps prepared. after
verification by dna sequencing, a clone of fragment 1 was digested
by kpn1/bamh1; fragment 2 by bamh1/ xxxg942xxx ; and fragment 3 by  xxxg942xxx /
xba1; digestion products were purified and ligated into a pcdna3.1v5-his-b expression vector previously digested with kpn1/xba1, generating pcdna- xxxg9xxx  containing full-length  xxxg9xxx . the construct
was verified by partial dna sequencing.

synthesis of sirna

construction of a murine  xxxg9xxx  mutant

rna from mouse liver and kidney were isolated using tri-reagent
and transcribed into cdna with superscript iii rnase h- reverse transcriptase. rt from the two tissues was pooled and used for pcr.
primers containing t7 promoter and mouse  xxxg9xxx  (accession no.
x75926.1, shown as underlined text) sequences were used to synthesize
a 467 bp pcr product (sense primer 5⬘-taa tac gac tca cta tag gga gag
aat ggg caa ttc gca aac t-3⬘, antisense primer 5⬘-taa tac gac tca cta tag
gga gat tcc cgg aaa cgc aag tc-3⬘). a quantity of 100 nm of each primer
was used in the pcr mixture. pcr conditions were 95⬚c for 10 min
followed by 40 cycles of 94⬚c for 30 s, 65⬚c for 1 min, 75⬚c for 2 min
and a final extension step at 75⬚c for 10 min. this product was then
used to synthesize dsrna followed by sirna using the silencer sirna
cocktail kit.

a single aminoterminal  xxxg9xxx  mutant (abca1w590s, where trp590
was mutated to ser590 [18]) was generated using the quikchange2 xl
site-directed mutagenesis kit. the oligonucleotides used were: gaaga
tatgcgctatgtctcgggcggcttcgcctacttgc (sense) and gcaagtaggcgaagccgcccga
gacatag gcatatcttc (antisense), and pcdna- xxxg9xxx  plasmid dna as a

95⬚c for 50 s, 60⬚c for 50 s, and 68⬚c for 13 min, then extended for 7
min at 68⬚c. the construct was verified by partial dna sequencing.

hite’s medium containing 100 nm sirna and 0.65 ␮l fugene6 reagent.
after 4 h, the apical medium was diluted with 1 ml of hite’s medium.
all media contained 20 ␮g/ml hdl. apical and basal medium was
collected 24 h later and analyzed for efflux of ptdcho.
for expression of full-length or mutant  xxxg9xxx , cells were transfected with 2–4 ␮g of full-length  xxxg9xxx  plasmid and pulsed with 3hcholine the last 2–4 h of incubation before harvest. for analysis of
 xxxg9xxx  promoter activity, cells were plated into 12-well tissue culture
dishes and allowed to reach ⵑ 70% confluence before transient transfection. transfections were performed for 2 h in serum-free medium using
fugene 6 and 0.75 ␮g/well of  xxxg2041xxx - xxxg9xxx  plasmid. cells were cotransfected 0.25 ␮g/well of psv-␤-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency. cell lysates were harvested in reporter lysis buffer for
analysis of luciferase and ␤-galactosidase activities.

lipids were extracted from cell lysates (1 mg protein) according to the
method of bligh and dyer (19). lipids were resolved using tlc and
samples that co-migrated with ptdcho standard were scraped from the

results
lxr/rxr agonists decrease ptdcho

incubation of mle cells with 22hc and 9-cis ra significantly
decreased the mass of ptdcho by 31% within mle cells (n ⫽
12, p ⬍ 0.05, figure 1a). we next investigated if these effects
were associated with increased ptdcho efflux (figure 1b). murine
lung epithelia constitutively secreted ptdcho into the medium, a
process that was stimulated ⵑ 4-fold by 22hc and 9-cis ra when
cultured on plastic dishes (figure 1b).

we investigated if 22hc and 9-cis ra increased ptdcho efflux
by increasing  xxxg9xxx  levels. 22hc and 9-cis ra uniformly
produced a robust increase in cellular levels of  xxxg9xxx  protein
between 3 and 48 h of analysis (figures 2a and 2b). in these
studies we used a commercially available  xxxg9xxx  antibody

tection of the desired product was made by demonstrating selective induction of  xxxg9xxx  protein by 22hc and 9-cis ra coupled
with a predicted molecular mass of ⵑ 200 kd (figure 2c). realtime pcr revealed that these ligands produced a 3- to 5-fold
increase in expression of the  xxxg9xxx  transcript (figure 3a).
these findings suggest that lxr/rxr agonists transcriptionally
activate the  xxxg9xxx  gene. the  xxxg9xxx  gene is activated by an
lxr/rxr-dependent pathway via binding of 22hc and 9-cis
ra ligands to lxr and rxr nuclear heterodimers, respectively, resulting in transactivaton of its promoter within a specific
response motif ( xxxg1057xxx  locus). to examine this in lung epithelia,
we cloned two fragments of the  xxxg9xxx  promoter (abca1644
and abca1948), coupled them to a reporter gene, and performed
transient transfections to assess transcriptional regulatory activity. the abca1644 construct lacks a  xxxg1057xxx  element, whereas the
abca1948 fragment contains this response element. as shown
in figures 3b and 3c, the lxr/rxr ligands selectively activated
abca1948 promoter activity but did not stimulate abca1644
activity. thus, oxysterols induce  xxxg9xxx  by a  xxxg1057xxx  dependent
pathway in lung epithelia.
lxr/rxr agonists stimulate ptdcho efflux

to separate apical from basolateral secretion, we cultured cells
in transwell dishes (figure 4a). under stimulatory conditions
using 22hc and 9-cis ra, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase in
apical (figure 4a, inset) and basolateral efflux of ptdcho from

cells (figure 4a). interestingly, only agonist-induced basolateral
ptdcho efflux was blocked by  xxxd2215xxx , an  xxxg9xxx  inhibitor
(figure 4a).
as a complementary approach, we transfected cells with
sirna to  xxxg9xxx  (figures 4b–4d). cells were labeled with
[methyl 3h]-choline with or without 22hc and 9-cis ra for
24 h, and basolateral or apical medium was initially removed for
analysis of ptdcho efflux. cells were then rinsed and transfected
with  xxxg9xxx  sirna for an additional 24 h devoid of 22hc and
9-cis ra in the medium. immunoblotting at 48 h confirmed that
 xxxg9xxx  sirna, unlike scrambled sirna, reduced levels of
 xxxg9xxx  protein without altering ␤-actin levels compared with
control (figure 4b). analysis of [methyl 3h]-ptdcho efflux within
the basolateral or apical medium at 24 h confirmed that 22hc
and 9-cis ra significantly stimulated phospholipid release (figures 4c and 4d). assays conducted on basolateral medium (figure 4c) at 48 h revealed that 22hc and 9-cis ra still produced
nearly a 60% increase in ptdcho efflux above control (p ⫽ 0.07);
moreover, exposure to  xxxg9xxx  sirna totally blocked agonistinduced basolateral ptdcho efflux (p ⬍ 0.05). in contrast,
 xxxg9xxx  sirna did not attenuate 22hc and 9-cis ra stimulation of the apical ptdcho export pathway (figure 4d). together,
the data suggest that alveolar lung epithelia harbor an oxysterolsensitive basolateral atp-binding cassette transporter involved
in phospholipid export. these effects of 22hc and 9-cis ra on
ptdcho efflux results in diminished availability of surfactant
phospholipids.
upregulation of  xxxg9xxx  increases ptdcho efflux selectively

to examine if  xxxg9xxx  directly stimulates ptdcho export within
alveolar epithelia, we transiently expressed full-length  xxxg9xxx 
in mle cells. we also examined whether 22hc/9-cis ra selectively eliminated ptdcho species distinct from dsptdcho. as
shown in figures 5a and 5b, transient transfection of cells resulted in increased immunoreactive  xxxg9xxx  content. the efflux
of total ptdcho increased ⵑ 2-fold after  xxxg9xxx  expression
compared with untransfected cells (figure 5c). moreover, expression of an  xxxg9xxx  construct harboring a mutation at trp590
resulted in partial loss of efflux activity as it was only 65% as
active as wild-type  xxxg9xxx  (figure 5d).
in separate studies, murine lung epithelia were cultured in
serum- and fatty acid–free medium containing the lipid acceptor,
apo ai, in the presence or absence of 22hc/9-cis ra. after
stimulation, medium was harvested, lipids extracted, ptdcho
isolated using tlc, and processed for analysis of fatty acid
molecular species using glc. cells were observed to constitutively release ptdcho into the medium containing high levels
of the polyunsaturates (20:4/20:1), monounsaturates (18:1), and
saturated species (16:0/18:0). moreover, upregulation of  xxxg9xxx 
by 22hc and 9-cis ra tended to decrease linoleic acid (18:2)
efflux and significantly increase in export of ptdcho species
containing saturated (16:0) molecular species into the medium
(table 1). the results suggest that both genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of  xxxg9xxx  activity can result in the export
of ptdcho from lung epithelia, and that oxysterols selectively
trigger elimination of surfactant-associated phospholipids.

discussion
these results provide evidence of a viable  xxxg9xxx -mediated basolateral export pathway for surfactant ptdcho in polarized alveolar
epithelia under transcriptional control by oxysterols. we used
pharmacologic and genetic strategies to modulate  xxxg9xxx  activity
providing evidence in support of a functional  xxxg9xxx  transporter
in lung epithelia. the data further show that oxysterol-activation
of  xxxg9xxx  results in export of saturated ptdcho species typical

of surfactant films. the pathophysiologic significance of these
studies is that in acute lung injury, leakage of circulating ldl
into the alveolus under an oxidant stress results in formation of
oxidatively modified particles (ox-ldl) containing oxysterols
(3, 4). ox-ldl not only decrease surfactant synthesis (3), but
the present results suggest that bioactive components within
ldl might also impact cellular phospholipid levels by modulating release of surfactant-like ptdcho species via basolateral alveolar export. ultimately, this could lead to diminished pools of
surfactant needed to maintain alveolar stability.
the existence of a constitutively active basolateral ptdcho
efflux route provides additional complexity to the existing model
whereby surfactant ptdcho is synthesized, stored, and released
from the alveolar type ii epithelium. the classic secretory pathway for ptdcho involves biosynthesis within the cytoplasmic
compartment, packaging into lamellar bodies with other surfactant apoproteins, and agonist-induced apical secretion into the
alveolar lumen. once within the alveolus, the surfactant film
undergoes significant modification morphologically and biochemically; apical re-uptake of both lipid and protein components is well described (22). the current results show constitutive
and inducible apical and basolateral release of ptdcho from
alveolar cells; oxysterol-stimulated apical release might be mediated by second messengers well recognized in surfactant lipid
secretion such as protein kinase c (23). consistent with this,
apically-stimulated ptdcho export by 22hc and 9-cis ra was
partially blocked by the protein kinase c inhibitor, sphingosine
(data not shown). on the other hand, it is plausible that different
members of the abc family export ptdcho apically, whereas
basolateral phospholipid efflux is  xxxg9xxx -mediated. in this re-

gard, several other abc pumps are targets for 22hc and 9-cis
ra (24). moreover, these half-transporters, such as abcg5
and abcg8, have recently been identified in apical membranes
within polarized epithelia (25). thus, our data in figure 4 showing oxysterol stimulation of apical ptdcho secretion that is not
blocked by  xxxg9xxx  sirna is in line with distinct pathways
involved in apical surfactant lipid secretion catalyzed perhaps
by other abc transport pumps.
the identification of a basolateral surfactant lipid efflux pathway in alveolar cells that is lxr/rxr- regulated appears to be
driven by  xxxg9xxx  as this route, but not the apical pathway, was
 xxxd2215xxx  sensitive (figure 4). by using an mrna silencing
approach, we were also able to selectively inhibit this basolateral
efflux pathway, demonstrating that  xxxg9xxx  is a functionally
relevant and likely polarized protein within alveolar epithelia
presumably involved in reverse lipid transport. in the process of
preparation of this manuscript, bortnick and coworkers recently
demonstrated existence of an lxr/rxr-sensitive  xxxg9xxx  protein in rodent alveolar epithelia, leading the authors to hypothesize that  xxxg9xxx  might partake in lung cholesterol homeostasis
(26). although  xxxg9xxx  is a well characterized cholesterol exporter, some studies suggest that phospholipids may be primary
substrates for  xxxg9xxx  (27, 28). our studies are distinct from
that of bortnick and colleagues and from those of others in that
we pursued a complementary hypothesis that  xxxg9xxx  activation
might selectively release ptdcho basolaterally, with varying molecular composition. this was achieved by using a transwell system to allow biochemical analysis of both apical and basolateral
pathways. to our knowledge, these data are the first showing
the molecular species of ptdcho released in response to  xxxg9xxx

activation. murine lung cells released large amounts of polyunsaturates, monounsaturates, and saturated species to apo ai
under native conditions (table 1). this fatty acid profile is not
consistent with highly conserved mammalian surfactant, but is
suggestive of ptdcho species observed in serum and within rodent type ii epithelia (29, 30). further, the results might indicate
a novel role for  xxxg9xxx  or other related efflux pumps such as
multidrug-resistant glycoproteins in enriching type ii epithelia

with dsptdcho by eliminating unsaturated ptdcho. in contrast
to this baseline pattern of efflux, 22hc/9-cis ra increased export
of 16:0 ptdcho species to apo ai, suggesting that agonist-induced
activation of  xxxg9xxx  might contribute significantly to trafficking
of surfactant-associated phospholipids. overall, these data suggest that  xxxg9xxx  functions in a capacity to eliminate excess
phospholipid from type ii epithelia. this might simply be a
mechanism by which alveolar cells tightly control steady-state
ptdcho content, or a means to avoid cellular lipotoxicity as
observed elseware (31); however, the prospect that  xxxg9xxx  is
a basolateral exporter of nonsurfactant phospholipids allowing
for these cells to acquire the type ii cell lipophenotype is an
attractive possibility but will require comparative analysis with
other epithelia and as well as within primary type ii cell isolates.
to investigate the structural basis for lung epithelial ptdcho
efflux, we engineered a point mutation within  xxxg9xxx  at trp590
and expressed this variant in mle cells. there are over thirty
 xxxg9xxx  mutations in patients with tangier’s disease, but recent
loss-of-function studies suggest that such mutations within the
first extracellular loop of the transporter’s primary structure
results in markedly attenuated phospholipid efflux (18, 32, 33).
accordingly, the abca1590 construct compared with control was
observed to exhibit significantly lower rates of ptdcho efflux in
mle cells. however, in lung epithelia this mutation alone did
not completely abolish or drastically eliminate ptdcho efflux as
observed elsewhere (18); this raises the possibility that additional
sites or distinct hydrophobic domains within  xxxg9xxx  might confer activity or exhibit differential binding affinities for various
ptdcho species.
our studies do not define the relative contribution of  xxxg9xxx 
mediated basolateral lipid efflux of ptdcho to the overall model
of surfactant secretion and recycling, but presumably, a delicate
balance between apical and basolateral export, when perturbed,
might impact the cellular reserve of surfactant lipid. another related flipase, abca3, is exclusively detected in lung lamellar bodies
and thus might complement  xxxg9xxx  activity providing a level of
redundancy or coordinate intracellular transport of phospholipid
destined for apical export (14, 15). the fact that targeted disruption
of the  xxxg9xxx  gene in mice results in respiratory failure, reduced
serum phospholipids, and striking accumulation of lipid within
type ii cells provides support to the supposition that  xxxg9xxx 
might regulate surfactant trafficking in vivo. (13). although alveolar ptdcho levels were not measured in this study, the results
are consistent with our data showing that manipulation of
 xxxg9xxx  expression in lung epithelia can significantly regulate
surfactant ptdcho balance. in this regard, 22hc/9-cis ra treatment led to increased transporter expression and basolateral
efflux of ptdcho resulting in decreased phospholipid mass.
finally, lxr/rxr ligand activation of  xxxg9xxx  transporter
activity clearly resulted from increased gene transcription as
evidenced by our protein, mrna, and transfectional studies
using  xxxg9xxx  promoter–reporter constructs. to date, the char-

agassandian, mathur, zhou, et al.: oxysterols regulate surfactant efflux

acterization and regulation of two distinct proximal promoters
for  xxxg9xxx  has been reported (28, 34). our abca1644 construct
harbors a weak tata box, lacks a  xxxg1057xxx  element, and shows
weak activity. a larger promoter fragment (abca1948) was also
cloned in view of studies suggesting different transcription initiation sites (35). this construct harbors a tata box and a  xxxg1057xxx 
element that appears to confer more robust core activity (35, 36).
indeed, transactivation of  xxxg9xxx  in alveolar cells by 22hc
and 9-cis ra was dependent on the  xxxg1057xxx  locus within the
proximal 5⬘ flanking region of the gene. further studies on the
role of oxysterols in  xxxg9xxx  transcriptional activation using
promoter-reporter mice or other suitable in vivo models will be
important in clarifying the contribution of these efflux pumps
to surfactant metabolism.
