1 the aim of the present study was to examine the eects of chronic infusion of the long-acting
agonist salmeterol on pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor function in sprague-dawley rats in vivo and to
elucidate the molecular basis of any altered state.
2 systemic administration of rats with salmeterol for 7 days compromised the ability of salmeterol
and  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2), given acutely by the intravenous route, to protect against achinduced bronchoconstriction when compared to rats treated identically with vehicle.
3 b1- and b2-adrenoceptor density was signi®cantly reduced in lung membranes harvested from
salmeterol-treated animals, which was associated with impaired salmeterol- and pge2-induced cyclic
amp accumulation ex vivo.
4 three variants of gsa that migrated as 42, 44 and 52 kda peptides on sds polyacrylamide gels
were detected in lung membranes prepared from both groups of rats but the intensity of each
isoform was markedly reduced in rats that received salmeterol.
5 the activity of cytosolic, but not membrane-associated, g-protein receptor-coupled kinase was
elevated in the lung of salmeterol-treated rats when compared to vehicle-treated animals.
6 the ability of salmeterol, administered systemically, to protect the airways of untreated rats
against ach-induced bronchoconstriction was short-acting (to *45 min), which contrasts with its
long-acting nature when given to asthmatic subjects by inhalation.
7 these results indicate that chronic treatment of rats with salmeterol results in heterologous
desensitization of pulmonary gs-coupled receptors. in light of previous data obtained in rats treated
chronically with salbutamol, we propose that a primary mechanism responsible for this eect is a
reduction in membrane-associated gsa. the short-acting nature of salmeterol, when administered
systemically, and the reduction in b-adrenoceptor number may be due to metabolism to a
biologically-active, short-acting and non-selective b-adrenoceptor agonist.

introduction
repeated administration of high-dose b2-adrenoceptor
agonists renders susceptible individuals tolerant to their
bene®cial eects in asthma. with regard to long-acting
agonists, there is evidence that tolerance develops both to
their dilator and protective eects in the airways. lipworth
and colleagues (newnham et al., 1994; 1995) have reported
that 4 weeks treatment of asthmatic subjects with inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol produced a rightwards shift in

& lung institute, imperial college school of medicine, dovehouse
street, london sw3 6ly, u.k. e-mail: m.giembycz@ ic.ac.uk

the bronchodilator dose-response curve for both agonists.
this state of tolerance was re¯ected in terms of a decrease in
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and forced
expiratory ¯ow at 25% and 75% of vital capacity
(fef25 ± 75), indicating that subsensitivity of b2-adrenoceptors to salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  had occurred in the large
and small airways. equally, tolerance to the protective eect
of salmeterol against  xxxd2586xxx - and exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction has been documented in mild to
moderate asthmatic subjects after chronic administration
(boulet et al., 1998; cheung et al., 1992; drotar et al., 1998;
simons et al., 1997).

p.a. finney et al

the molecular aetiology of b2-adrenoceptor sub-sensitivity
in asthma is unclear. airways resected from asthmatic
patients fail to relax normally to  xxxd2398xxx , supporting a
possible defect in b-adrenoceptor function (bai et al., 1992;
cerrina et al., 1986; goldie et al., 1986), although it is
equivocal whether this is the result of treatment or a
consequence of the disease process itself. nevertheless,
down-regulation of b-adrenoceptor number in lung and
airways smooth muscle has been reported in animals given
 xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline chronically by infusion
(nerme et al., 1990; nishikawa et al., 1993; 1994) and this
is associated with a reduced functional responsiveness
towards b-adrenoceptor agonists ex vivo (nerme et al.,
1990; nishikawa et al., 1994). thus, it is possible that
compromised bronchodilatation and loss of protection
against various bronchoconstrictor challenges in humans is
due, at least in part, to pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor
desensitization.
two major molecular mechanisms have been delineated in
isolated cells that result in short-term b2-adrenoceptor
desensitization. one of these promotes homologous refractoriness and involves the uncoupling of the agonist-occupied
form of the receptor from the stimulatory guanine
nucleotide binding protein, gs, by mechanisms that require
phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at the
carboxy-terminus of the agonist-occupied receptor (fredericks et al., 1996; premont et al., 1995). this reaction can be
catalysed by at least three members of the g-protein
receptor-coupled kinase (grk) superfamily family, including  xxxg970xxx  and  xxxg971xxx  (krupnick & benovic, 1998; premont
et al., 1995). the subsequent binding of b-arrestin, a soluble
protein that prevents further coupling to gs (lohse et al.,
1990), then halts signalling through the receptor. short-term
desensitization is also eected by  xxxd1773xxx -dependent
protein kinase (pka) following phosphorylation of serine
and threonine residues present within the third intracellular
loop of the protein in response to an increase in intracellular
 xxxd1773xxx  (lohse et al., 1990). in contrast, prolonged
periods of desensitization can involve physical internalization
and subsequent degradation of receptors (lohse, 1993) due
to an inhibition of transcription and/or increased posttranscriptional processing of b2-adrenoceptor mrna
(lohse, 1993; mayor et al., 1998). in addition, another
less-well characterized process is a reduction of membraneassociated gsa (milligan, 1993), although the functional
relevance of this process has not been rigorously explored in
vitro or in vivo.
although desensitization of g-protein-coupled receptors
(gpcr) has been studied extensively, most of the information to date has been gathered from cultured cell systems
and the extent to which this applies to the in vivo situation
is little investigated. here we describe pulmonary b2adrenoceptor desensitization in rats treated chronically with
the long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol and have
investigated the molecular aetiology of this altered state.
although little is known of the regulation of the b2adrenoceptor in the rat, it was selected for two reasons.
first, the rat is relatively more steroid-sensitive than other
small laboratory animals such as the guinea-pig (hirshman
& downes, 1985). second, we have shown previously that
glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, protect against
pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor desensitization in the rat in vivo

methods
animals and surgery
male sprague-dawley rats (charles river ltd, kent) of
275 ± 300 g body weight were housed in a temperaturecontrolled (218c) environment with food and water available
ad libitum. animals were sedated with 2% v v71 hypnorm
(0.3 ml kg71) and implanted sub-cutaneously with osmotic
mini pumps (alzet model 2001) delivering salmeterol
(10 mg kg71 h71) or vehicle (0.1% glacial acetic acid in
phosphate-buered saline) for 7 days as described previously
(finney et al., 2000). the dose of salmeterol is approximately
25% of the dose of salbutamol used in patients hospitalized
with acute severe asthma (bohn et al., 1984; cheong et al.,
1988; cluzel et al., 1990; o'driscoll et al., 1988) and is based
on equivalence studies in human asthmatic subjects, where a
weight-for-weight dose ratio for salmeterol:salbutamol of 1 : 4
was found (higham et al., 1997). salmeterol was given as an
infusion to allow a comparison with a previous study where
desensitization of pulmonary b2-adrenoceptors was induced
in rats treated systemically with salbutamol (finney et al.,
2000).

instrumentation of rats for measurement of airway
mechanics
each rat was anaesthetized with urethane and the left carotid
artery and left jugular vein were cannulated for measuring
changes in blood pressure and for the injection of drugs
respectively. the trachea was cannulated and the animal
ventilated at constant volume with a pump operating at 75
strokes per minute. changes in respiratory insuation
pressure were measured using a modi®cation of the method
described by konzett & roèssler (1940) as described in finney
et al. (2000).

assessment of pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor desensitization
in vivo
vehicle- and salmeterol-treated rats were given ach
(500 mg kg71 i.v, bolus) every 5 min to establish a constant
degree of bronchoconstriction. when airway function had
normalized (15 min after last dose of ach), a submaximal
concentration of salmeterol (100 mg kg71 i.v. bolus) was
administered and the magnitude of ach-induced bronchoconstriction was reassessed 5 min later. an identical protocol
was used to assess the potential bronchoprotective eect of
pge2 (300 mg kg71 i.v. bolus).

quantification of b-adrenoceptor number in lung
membranes
lung membranes were prepared according to mak et al.
(1995) and nishikawa et al. (1993), and total, b1- and b2adrenoceptor density (bmax) and the anity (kd) of [125i]iodocyanopindolol ([125i]-icyp) was determined as described
previously (finney et al., 2000).

p.a. finney et al

measurement of steady-state b1- and b2-adrenoceptor
mrna levels
total rna was isolated from lung as described by
chomczynski & sacchi (1987) and the abundance of b1and b2-adrenoceptor mrna transcripts estimated by northern blot analysis. samples of denatured mrna (20 mg
lane71) were size fractionated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde
gels containing 20 mm mops (ph 7), 5 mm sodium acetate
and 1 mm edta, and transferred to hybond-n+ membranes (amersham) by capillary action using 206 standard
sodium citrate (ssc; 16 scc, 150 mm nacl, 15 mm sodium
citrate, ph 7). the rna was permanently ®xed to the
membranes using a uv stratalinker 2400 (stratagene,
cambridge).
random primer labelling was carried out with the 851 bp
smai/pvuii and 439 bp i fragments from the human b1and b2-adrenoceptor cdnas respectively using [a-32p]dctp. a 1272 bp psti fragment from the rat  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) cdna was
used as a `house-keeping' gene. pre-hybridization and
hybridization were carried out at 428c with the probes
labelled to approximately 1.56106 c.p.m. ml71 in buer a
(50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 50% formamide, 26 ssc, 56
denhardt's solution, 0.1% sds, 5 mm edta, 250 mg ml71
denatured salmon sperm dna). after hybridization, the
blots were washed to a stringency of 0.16 scc/0.1% sds
at 658c and exposed to kodak x-omat ®lm at 7808c
for 1 to 4 days. the autoradiograms were quanti®ed by
laser-scanning densitometry and expressed as a ratio to
 xxxg861xxx .

ex vivo  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation studies
lung was chopped (*5 mm3) and equilibrated for 30 min at
378c in oxygenating (95% o2/5% co2) krebs-henseleit (ks)
solution (in mm: 118 nacl, 5.9 kcl, 1.2  xxxd2534xxx .7h2o, 1.2
nah2po4.2h2o, 2.5 cacl2.6h2o, 10 glucose, 25 nahco3)
containing 10 mm indomethacin. tissue was incubated for
30 min in the presence of  xxxd2388xxx  (100 mm), and salmeterol
(1 mm) or pge2 (1 mm) was added for 5 min. tissue was
removed from the kh solution, blotted on absorbent paper,
immersed in liquid n2 and stored at 7808c. when required
the  xxxd1773xxx  content was extracted from the lung and
measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously
(finney et al., 2000; seybold et al., 1998).

measurement of grk activity
cytosolic and particulate grk was prepared from rat lung
according to benovic et al. (1987) and grk activity was
determined immediately by the method of mayor et al.
(1987).

western immunoblot analyses
frozen lung was homogenized, denatured and subjected to
electrophoresis on 10% sds/tris polyacrylamide gels as
described previously (finney et al., 2000). proteins were
transferred onto hybond nitrocellulose paper and blocked
overnight in 10 mm  xxxd3449xxx /0.05% tween 20 containing
5% skimmed milk. membranes were then incubated at 258c

for 1 h with a rabbit polyclonal antibody speci®c to either
gsa, gb or the b2-adrenoceptor diluted 1 : 1000, 1 : 1000 and
1 : 750 respectively. membranes were washed, incubated with
a donkey, anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
antibody and treated with ecl reagent according to the
manufacturer's instructions. proteins were visualized by
exposure of the membranes to kodak x-omat ®lm and
quanti®ed by laser-scanning densitometry.

protein estimation
protein was measured using a biorad kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

drugs and analytical reagents
salmeterol was provided by glaxowellcome (stevenage,
hertfordshire, u.k.). ecl reagent, horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody and [a32p]-dctp and [125i]icyp (speci®c activities 43000 ci mmol71 and 2000 ci mmol71 respectively) were supplied by amersham international
(amersham, buckinghamshire, u.k.). antibodies against gsa
and gb were purchased from nen/dupont (code nei 805
and nei 808 respectively) and the b2-adrenoceptor antibody
was from santa cruz (sc # 569). all other reagents were from
sigma (poole, dorset, u.k.).

results
repeated administration of ach (500 mg kg71 i.v. *ed50) to
saline- and salmeterol-treated rats provoked bronchoconstriction that was highly reproducible over 60 min (data not
shown). the resting mean arterial blood pressure was not

between

(76.1+3.7 mmhg, n=28)- and salmeterol (77.9+8.2 mmhg,

of ach (500 mg kg71) evoked a depressor response in both
groups of rats of equivalent magnitude (vehicle:
34.4+1.5 mmhg, n=28; salmeterol: 29.1+3.1 mmhg,
n=28, p40.05).

effect of chronic treatment of rats with salmeterol on the
ability of salmeterol and pge2 to protect against
ach-induced bronchoconstriction
intravenous administration of salmeterol (100 mg kg71 bolus)
or pge2 (300 mg kg71 bolus) to vehicle-treated rats signi®cantly reduced (by 44 and 32% respectively) the
magnitude of ach-induced bronchoconstriction whereas in
the salmeterol-treated group of animals no signi®cant
protection was observed with either agonist indicating that
the desensitization was heterologous (figure 1a,b; table 1).
in none of the experiments did salmeterol or pge2 aect
resting airways tone.

effect of chronic treatment of rats with salmeterol on
b1- and b2-adrenoceptor density and mrna expression
in lung
chronic treatment of rats with salmeterol (10 mg kg71 h71)
produced a signi®cant (*70%) reduction in b-adrenoceptor
density when compared to naõè ve animals, without aecting
the anity of the non-selective ligand, [125i]-icyp (table 2).
in the presence of selective antagonists it was established that
salmeterol reduced b1- and b2-adrenoceptor number by 50
and 70% respectively but did not alter the kd of [125i]-icyp
for either receptor subtype (table 2). to determine whether
the in vivo binding of salmeterol to an `exosite' within the b2adrenoceptor reduced, arti®cially, the total number of
binding sites available to [125i]-icyp ex vivo, b2-adrenoceptor
protein in the lung from both groups of animals was
measured by western blotting. consistent with the radioligand binding data, chronic treatment of rats with
salmeterol reduced b2-adrenoceptor protein in lung membritish journal of pharmacology vol 132 (6)

branes by *50% (figure 2). despite the reduction in
receptor expression at day 7, the steady state level of b1and b2-adrenoceptor mrna transcripts was unchanged in

to determine if down-regulation of b-adrenoceptor number
was accompanied by compromised signal transduction, the
ability of salmeterol to increase  xxxd1773xxx  mass in lung
parenchyma was assessed ex vivo. no signi®cant dierence in
the basal  xxxd1773xxx  content was detected between lung
excised from either group of animals (figure 4). however,
salmeterol (1 mm)-induced  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation was

western blotting was performed to determine if the
compromised ability of salmeterol to elevate the cyclic
amp content in lung taken from salmeterol-treated rats
was associated with a reduction in the expression of gsa
(figure 5). a primary antibody raised against an epitope at
the carboxy-terminus of the a-subunit of gs, identi®ed three
bands in lung membranes prepared from vehicle-treated rats
that migrated as 42, 44 and 52 kda peptides on sds
polyacrylamide gels. treatment of rats for 7 days with
salmeterol signi®cantly reduced the intensity of each of these
bands by between 45 and 70% (figure 5a,b). a primary
antibody raised against an epitope at the carboxy-terminus of
the common b-subunit of heterotrimeric gtp-binding
proteins, detected a single 35 kda band in lung membranes
prepared from vehicle-treated rats. however, unlike gsa
variants, gb was not altered in lung taken from salmeteroltreated animals (data not shown). western blotting failed to
detect gsa or gb subunits in the cytosolic fraction of lung
tissue taken from either group of animals at day 7.

discussion
systemic infusion of salmeterol to rats for 7 days promoted
pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor desensitization that was seen
both at the functional and molecular level. this ®nding is
consistent with a number of previous studies where
desensitization of b2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation has
been demonstrated ex vivo in tracheae and lung taken from
rats treated chronically with  xxxd2398xxx  and noradrenaline
(avner & noland, 1978; nishikawa et al., 1994), and in vivo
in rats given salbutamol (finney et al., 2000). signi®cantly,
the anti-spasmogenic activity of pge2, which relaxes rat
tracheae through  xxxg1875xxx -like prostanoid receptors (lydford &
mckechnie, 1994), was also impaired indicating that the
desensitization was heterologous. although this mode of
desensitization is poorly documented in vivo, it has been
observed in the lung and heart of rats given salbutamol
(finney et al., 2000) and  xxxd2398xxx  (zeiders et al., 1997)
respectively.
many processes can eect desensitization of b2-adrenoceptors and, as the molecular aetiology of long-term subsensitivity in vivo is largely unexplored, several mechanisms were
investigated.

down-regulation of b2-adrenoceptor number
systemic treatment of rats with salmeterol produced a
marked (70%) reduction in pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor
british journal of pharmacology vol 132 (6)

density relative to animals that received vehicle. these
results agree with a previous study where rats were
treated chronically with salbutamol (finney et al., 2000),
but the degree of receptor down-regulation eected by
salmeterol was much greater. the reason for this
disparity is currently unclear. one explanation is that
the decrease in bmax may have been over-estimated due
to pseudo-irreversible in vivo binding of salmeterol to the
`exosite' within the b2-adrenoceptor, which would reduce
the total number of binding sites available to [125i]-icyp
ex vivo. however, this possibility seems unlikely
as a comparable (52%) reduction in b2-adrenoceptor
protein was found in lung membranes by western
analysis.
the results of the present and a previous study (finney et
al., 2000) are consistent with the concept that chronic
exposure of animals to b2-adrenoceptor agonists eects
tolerance by stimulating the internalization and degradation
of the cognate receptors (lohse, 1993). although destabilization of b2-adrenoceptor mrna can account for this eect,
there was no evidence for a reduction in mrna transcripts
in the lung of salmeterol-treated rats at day 7. this was
unexpected and contrary to previous in vivo experiments
performed in rats and guinea-pigs given  xxxd2398xxx  (mak
et al., 1995; nishikawa et al., 1993) and noradrenaline
(nishikawa et al., 1994) respectively. at least three
explanations could account for this discrepancy. first, the
ecacy and selectivity of salmeterol, noradrenaline and
 xxxd2398xxx  dier between b-adrenoceptor subtypes, which
may in¯uence the magnitude and kinetics of mrna
degradation. second, b-adrenoceptor expression and function vary between strains of rat (van liefde et al., 1994).
thus, mrna in the lung of sprague-dawley rats treated
with salmeterol (this study) may be degraded relatively
rapidly and recover to steady-state levels by day 7 when
compared to wistar rats treated identically with  xxxd2398xxx

gsa and desensitization of b2-adrenoceptors in vivo

1267

figure 5 eect of chronic systemic treatment of rats with salmeterol on gsa expression in lung membranes. rats were treated with
salmeterol (10 mg kg71 h71) or vehicle for 7 days and the expression of membrane-associated gsa variants was measured by western
blotting. (a,b) show representative blot and a bar charts of the mean data (+s.e.mean of six determinations) respectively. equal
loading was con®rmed by staining of the gels with coomassie blue (not shown). *p50.05, signi®cant reduction in gsa variant
expression.

(mak et al., 1995; nishikawa et al., 1993). third, salmeterol
may down-regulate pulmonary b2-adrenoceptors in spraguedawley rats by a process unrelated to mrna destabilization.
while tolerance to salmeterol could be due to the
reduction in pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor density, other
processes must be involved, as pge2-induced responses
were also impaired. indeed, the desensitization of salmeterol-induced  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation in lung ex vivo
was very similar in magnitude to that produced in the
lung of salbutamol-treated rats (finney et al., 2000), which
would not be expected if b2-adrenoceptor down-regulation
was the only determinant of tolerance. in addition,
heterologous desensitization may have resulted, at least in
part, from down-regulation/uncoupling of the  xxxg1875xxx -like
receptor. although the mechanism by which this could
occur is unclear, pka is an unlikely eector as activation
of this enzyme by salbutamol was signi®cantly impaired in

lung taken from salbutamol-treated rats (finney et al.,
2000).

activation of grks
phosphorylation of gpcrs by grks can promote desensitization. however, grk activity was not elevated in lung
membranes prepared from salmeterol- (this study) or
salbutamol-treated rats (finney et al., 2000), which is
consistent with grk-induced receptor phosphorylation being
a short-term process. moreover, as grks eect homologous
desensitization it is dicult to envisage how this process
could also inhibit pge2-induced responses. in contrast,
cytosolic grk activity was signi®cantly increased in the
lung of salmeterol-treated rats, in agreement with a previous
study where salbutamol was used (finney et al., 2000), which
may be due to increased  xxxg970xxx  gene transcription and/or
mrna stability (iaccarino et al., 1998).

p.a. finney et al

gsa and desensitization of b2-adrenoceptors in vivo

chronic exposure, by degradation of gsa (milligan, 1993).
the results presented herein are consistent with the
degradation theory as the reduction in membrane-associated
gsa was not associated with a commensurate increase of gsa
in the cytosol at day 7.
a critical question that arises from the present study is
whether a 45 to 70% reduction in gsa is sucient to eect
tolerance to salmeterol. as discussed previously (finney et
al., 2000) evidence provided by paulssen et al. (1992) suggests
that changes in gsa expression can, indeed, aect signalling
through gpcrs in an agonist-dependent manner.

duration of action of intravenous salmeterol

figure 6 duration of action of intravenous salmeterol in rats.
naõè ve rats were given ach (500 mg kg71, i.v.) and changes in
over¯ow pressure were measured. when basal lung function was reestablished salmeterol (100 mg kg71 i.v.; bolus) was given and 5, 10,
15, 30, 45 and 60 min later the magnitude of ach-induced
bronchoconstriction was measured. at 65 min salmeterol
(100 mg kg71 i.v.; bolus) was given again and the protection against
the original bronchoconstrictor response was measured. data points
represent the mean+s.e.mean of six independent determinations.

down-regulation of gsa
heterologous desensitization gpcrs can be accounted for by
a reduction in the abundance of membrane-associated gsa
(milligan, 1993). indeed, three molecular weight species of
gsa were detected in rat lung membranes as reported
previously (finney et al., 2000) but the expression was
signi®cantly reduced in tissue taken from those animals that
received salmeterol. further support for this mechanism
derives from a previous study where chronic treatment of rats
with salbutamol reduced the ability of cholera toxin to
increase the  xxxd1773xxx  content in lung ex vivo (finney et
al., 2000). moreover, the bronchoprotective eect of  xxxd1742xxx 
and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor,  xxxd2388xxx , was preserved in rats treated chronically with
salbutamol providing further evidence that the site of
desensitization is upstream of adenylyl cyclase (finney et
al., 2000). mechanistically, down-regulation of gsa would
blunt the ability of salmeterol, and other agonists (e.g. pge2)
that utilize the same pool of gsa, to activate adenylyl cyclase
and protect the airways against ach-induced bronchoconstriction. a similar explanation is suggested for the impaired
activation of adenylyl cyclase by  xxxd2398xxx  and glucagon
ex vivo in cardiac membranes puri®ed from rats treated
chronically with  xxxd2398xxx  (zeiders et al., 1997).
down-regulation of gsa could be eected by at least three
mechanisms (discussed in finney et al., 2000) including
decreased gsa gene transcription, destabilization of gsa
mrna transcripts or redistribution/degradation of membrane-associated gsa. in cell-based experiments there is
strong evidence that b-adrenoceptor agonists promote the
translocation of gsa from the membrane to a cytosolic pool
(ransnas et al., 1989; wedegaertner et al., 1996) by a process
that involves depalmitoylation of the protein (wedegaertner
& bourne, 1994; loisel et al., 1999). this is followed, after
british journal of pharmacology vol 132 (6)

an unexpected observation of the present investigation was
the short-acting behaviour of salmeterol when given to rats
by the intravenous route that was not the result of acute b2adrenoceptor desensitization. if the duration of action of
salmeterol is to be explained by binding to an exosite (green
et al., 1996; rong et al., 1999) then this should be
independent of the route of administration. thus, other
mechanisms must account for this dierence. one possibility
is that salmeterol was rapidly metabolized to a shorter-acting
molecule that retained anity and ecacy at the b2adrenoceptor. this situation would be in contrast to
administration by inhalation where salmeterol's high lipophilicity would ensure that it is rapidly absorbed and retained in
the airways; indeed, bronchoprotection eected by inhaled
salmeterol in asthmatic subjects persists for more than 12 h
(rabe et al., 1993). previous studies in rats have established
that salmeterol is cleared predominantly by metabolism and
at least two, albeit minor, products can be formed by odealkylation of the phenalkyloxalkyl `tail' that, theoretically
could be short-acting (manchee et al., 1993). in our own
preliminary studies we have found that following bolus
intravenous administration of salmeterol to sprague-dawley
rats, the circulating level fell rapidly due to the combined
eects of a very high volume of distribution (previously
estimated at 42 ml min71 kg71) and metabolism with products resulting from o-dealkylation detected (authors'
unpublished observations). metabolism of salmeterol could
also account for the unanticipated reduction in pulmonary
b1-adrenoceptor density after chronic treatment if these odealkylated metabolites are agonists at both b1- and b2adrenoceptor subtypes. alternatively, the down-regulation of
b1-adrenoceptors might simply re¯ect the weak agonist
activity of salmeterol at this subtype (ball et al., 1991; roux
et al., 1996).

conclusion
chronic systemic treatment of rats with salmeterol produced
pulmonary b2-adrenoceptor desensitization. although several
processes could contribute to this eect, the heterologous
nature of the desensitization and the results of a previous
investigation with salbutamol (finney et al., 2000) where the
bronchoprotective eect of  xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx  were
preserved, suggest that a primary molecular aetiology is a
reduction in the abundance of membrane-associated gsa. as
salmeterol is a partial agonist on many tissues the marked
reduction in b2-adrenoceptor density may also have contributed to desensitization. it is important to appreciate that

p.a. finney et al

these experiments were performed with healthy rats and the
relevance of the ®ndings to patients with asthma is unknown.
however, evidence that asthma, itself, does not predispose to
b2-adrenoceptor desensitization has been presented (penn et
al., 1996). thus, down-regulation of gsa may be pertinent to
the treatment of asthma where susceptible individuals become
tolerant to the bene®cial eects of salmeterol or high doses of
short-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonists such as salbutamol.
