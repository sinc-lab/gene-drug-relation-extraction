abstract—n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (11), and a group of analogues possessing an appropriately substituted-phenyl
substituent (4-f, 2,4-f2, 4-so2me, 4-ochme2) attached to its c-4, or c-5 position, were synthesized for evaluation as selective
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors. in vitro cox-1/cox-2 inhibition studies showed that 11 is a more potent inhibitor
(cox-1 ic50 = 0.06 lm; cox-2 ic50 = 0.25 lm) than aspirin (cox-1 ic50 = 0.35 lm; cox-2 ic50 = 2.4 lm), and like aspirin
[cox-2 selectivity index (s.i.) = 0.14], 11 is a nonselective cox-2 inhibitor (cox-2 s.i. = 0.23). regioisomers having a 2,4-diﬂuorophenyl substituent attached to the c-4 (cox-2 ic50 = 0.087 lm; cox-2 s.i. >1149), or c-5 (cox-2 ic50 = 0.77 lm, si > 130),
position of 11 exhibited the most potent and selective cox-2 inhibitory activity relative to the reference drug celecoxib (cox-1
ic50 = 33.1 lm; cox-2 ic50 = 0.07 lm; cox-2 s.i. = 472). n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (11, ed50 = 49 mg/kg), and
its c-4 2,4-diﬂuorophenyl derivative (ed50 = 91 mg/kg), exhibited superior antiinﬂammatory activity (oral dosing) in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay compared to aspirin (ed50 = 129 mg/kg). these latter compounds exhibited comparable analgesic activity to the reference drug diﬂunisal, and  xxxd2565xxx  activity compared to aspirin, in a 4% nacl-induced abdominal
constriction assay. a molecular modeling (docking) study indicated that the so2nhcoch3 substituent present in n-acetyl-2-carboxy-4-(2,4-ﬂuorophenyl)benzenesulfonamide, like the acetoxy substituent in aspirin, is suitably positioned to acetylate the ser530
hydroxyl group in the cox-2 primary binding site. the results of this study indicate that the so2nhcoch3 pharmacophore present in n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamides is a suitable bioisostere for the acetoxy (ocome) group in aspirin.

1. introduction
the complex biological actions exhibited by the simple
salicylate class of compounds have attracted on-going
attention for more than 100 years. in this context, the
moderately active antiinﬂammatory and nonnarcotic
analgesic agent  xxxd234xxx  (aspirin, 1) continues
to be a frequent ﬁrst choice drug in the treatment of
some arthritic disorders (see structure in fig. 1). however, these beneﬁcial actions of aspirin may also be
accompanied by adverse eﬀects that include tinnitus,
hypersensitization, and contraindicated gastrointestinal
irritation, bleeding and/or ulceration.1 the ability of
aspirin to inhibit blood platelet aggregation is now
viewed as a clinically useful prophylactic action that

can reduce the incidence of thrombus formation in individuals with cardiovascular disease. the search for a
clinical replacement for aspirin resulted in the development of the nonacetylating  xxxd3159xxx  derivative
diﬂunisal (2) that is a more potent antiinﬂammatory
and analgesic agent with a longer duration of action that
is less ulcerogenic than aspirin.2 the subsequent discovery3,4 that there are two cyclooxygenase isozymes  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 provided the basis for the drug design concept that selective cox-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib5
elicit eﬀective antiinﬂammatory activity devoid of the
ulcerogenic eﬀect associated with the use of nonsteroidal
antiinﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin that
inhibit both cox-1 and cox-2. aspirin is a unique
nonselective cox inhibitor due to its ability to acetylate
the ser530 hydroxyl group in the primary cox binding
site of cox-1 and cox-2. in this regard, aspirin is a
10- to 100-fold more potent inhibitor of cox-1 relative
to cox-2.6 acetylation of the weakly nucleophilic oh
of ser530 by aspirin is thought to result from initial binding of its cooh to the arg120 residue near the mouth
of the cox binding site, which positions the ortho-acetoxy moiety in close proximity to the ser530 oh, which
it acetylates. some of aspirins beneﬁcial therapeutic
eﬀects arise from acetylation of cox-2, whereas its
antithrombotic and ulcerogenic eﬀects result from
acetylation of cox-1. these observations were
exploited in the design of the aspirin analogue o-(acetoxyphenyl)hept-2-ynyl sulﬁde (aphs, 3) that is a selective cox-2 inhibitor.7 in an earlier study, we reported a
novel class of isomeric acetoxy analogues of rofecoxib
(4), which are potent and selective cox-2 inhibitors
that, like aspirin, have the potential to acetylate the
cox-2 isozyme.8

appropriately substituted-phenyl substituent attached

2. chemistry
n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (11) was synthesized using a two-step reaction sequence that involved n-acetylation of 2-methylbenzenesulfonamide
(9) followed by oxidation of the aryl c-2 methyl substituent using kmno4 in 0.5 n aqueous naoh as illustrated in scheme 1. the target n-acetyl-2carboxybenzenesulfonamides (19a–d, 20a–e) having a
variety (r1 = h, f, so2me, ochme2; r2 = h, f) of
substituted-phenyl substituents at the c-4 or c-5 positions were prepared using a palladium-catalyzed suzuki
cross-coupling reaction according to the reaction sequence shown in scheme 2. chlorosulfonation of 3bromotoluene (12a), and 4-bromotoluene (12b), at
0 c followed by amminolysis using aqueous ammonium hydroxide in dioxane aﬀorded the respective sulfonamide (14a,b) in good yield. the subsequent
acetylation of 14a,b yielded the corresponding

it is known that the so2nhcoch3 moiety is a 105–106
more reactive acetylating agent of enzyme serine
hydroxyls than simple amides.9 in a recent study, it
was shown that the incorporation of a para-n-acetylsulfonamido substituent on the c-3 phenyl ring of the
rofecoxib regioisomer (5) provided a highly potent and
selective cox-2 inhibitor that has the potential to acetylate the cox-2 isozyme.10 after acetylation of the
cox-2 ser530 oh by compound 5, compound (6) having a free so2nh2 compound would be released that
could also exhibit cox-2 inhibitory activity. this rationale is based on observation that the water soluble nonnarcotic analgesic agent  xxxd2849xxx  sodium (7)11 is a
prodrug to the selective cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd3481xxx 
(8).12 accordingly, the so2nhcoch3 pharmacophore
could serve the dual role of acetylation agent and prodrug. as part of our on-going research program to design selective cox-2 inhibitors, we describe herein the
synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel group of
n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamides possessing an

n-acetyl-4-(or 5-)bromo-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide
(15a,b). the suzuki cross-coupling reaction13,14 between
an aryl bromide (15a,b) and a substituted-phenylboronic
acid (16) in the presence of 2 m aqueous  xxxd3212xxx  in tetrahydrofuran, using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) as a catalyst, aﬀorded the
respective biaryl derivative (17, 18). subsequent oxidation of the c-2 methyl aryl substituent present in 17
and 18 using kmno4 in 0.5 n aqueous naoh at
60 c for 6 h yielded the desired c-4 (19), or c-5 (20)
substituted-phenyl derivative of n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide. methylation of the 2-carboxy
compound 20d followed by reacetylation furnished 2methoxycarbonyl-5-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)benzenesulfonamide (21).it was necessary to reacetylate the sulfonamide substituent since it undergoes n-deacetylation

(11) is a more potent inhibitor of cox-1 and cox-2
[cox-1 ic50 = 0.06 lm; cox-2 ic50 = 0.25 lm;
cox-2 selectivity index (s.i.) = 0.23] than aspirin
(cox-1 ic50 = 0.35 lm; cox-2 ic50 = 2.4 lm;  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  s.i. = 0.14). introduction of a c-4 phenyl substituent
(19a) increased cox-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity (cox-1 ic50 = 0.33 lm; cox-2 ic50 = 0.03 lm,
s.i. = 10). in contrast, incorporation of a c-5 phenyl
substituent (20a) did not appreciably change cox-1
inhibitory activity but cox-2 inhibitory activity and
selectivity was decreased (cox-1 ic50 = 0.03 lm;
cox-2 ic50 = 1.2 lm; cox-2 s.i. = 0.02). the point
of attachment of a 4-ﬂuorophenyl substituent is a determinant of selectivity since the c-4 compound (19b)
selectively inhibits cox-1, whereas the c-5 regioisomer
(20b) is a selective cox-2 inhibitor. similarly, the c-4 4methanesulfonylphenyl regioisomer (19d) was a selective
cox-1 inhibitor, while the c-5 regioisomer (20d) was a
selective cox-2 inhibitor. on the other hand, placement
of a 2,4-diﬂuorophenyl substituent at either the c-4 pocox-2
sition
(19c,
cox-2
ic50 = 0.087 lm;
s.i. = >1149), or c-5 position (20c, cox-2
ic50 = 0.77 lm; cox-2 s.i. = >130) provided compounds with superior cox-2 selectivity with the c-4
diﬂuorophenyl regioisomer (19c) being a ninefold more
potent and selective cox-2 inhibitor than the c-5 regioisomer (20c). accordingly, n-acetyl-2-carboxy-4-(2,4diﬂuorophenyl)benzenesulfonamide (19c) (i) is a signiﬁcantly more potent and selective cox-2 inhibitor than
the reference drug aspirin (cox-1 ic50 > 0.35 lm;
cox-2 ic50 = 2.4 lm; cox-2 s.i. = 0.14), and (ii) a
slightly less potent but more selective cox-2 inhibitor
than celecoxib (cox-1 ic50 = 33.1 lm; cox-2
ic50 = 0.07 lm, s.i. = 472). other structure–activity

3. results and discussion
a group of n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamides
possessing an appropriately substituted-phenyl substituent attached to its c-4, or c-5, position were designed to
determine (i) whether the n-acetylsulfonamido moiety
(11) is a suitable bioisostere of the acetoxy substituent
in aspirin (1), and (ii) if a substituted-phenyl moiety attached to the c-4 or c-5 position of the parent 2-carboxybenzenesulfonamido ring will provide the additional
steric size required to confer cox-2 selectivity. in vitro
cox-1/cox-2 inhibition studies (see data in table 1)
showed that n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide

relationships acquired show that (i) introduction of a c5 4-isopropoxyphenyl substituent (20e) abolishes both
cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitory activity (ic50 values
>100 lm), and (ii) a c-2 carboxyl substituent is essential
since its elaboration (20d) to a c-2 methoxycarbonyl
substituent (21) destroys both cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitory activity.
a molecular modeling experiment was carried out to
determine the binding interactions of n-acetyl-2-carboxy-4-(2,4-diﬂuorophenyl)benzenesulfonamide (19c) in
the cox-2 binding site (fig. 2). the parent aromatic ring
possessing the c-2 carboxyl and n-acetylsulfonamido
substituents was oriented such that the carboxylic acid
moiety is positioned near the mouth of cox-2 binding
site where it forms a salt bridge (electrostatic interaction)
with the guanidino group of arg120 (distance < 3 å). the
n-acetylsulfonamido-substituent is located in a region
comprised of nonpolar amino acids such as ala527,
val349, leu359, leu531, and leu117. interestingly, the
c@o of the so2nhcome substituent forms a favorable
hydrogen bonding interaction with the oh of tyr355
close to the mouth of cox-2 channel (distance = 1.7 å).
the distance between the oh of ser530, which is the acetylation site for aspirin, and c@o of the so2nhcome
moiety is about 7.03 å. these observations suggest that
the so2nhcome moiety present in 19c is suitably orientated to potentially acetylate (covalent bond formation)
ser530 present in the cox-2 isozyme.
the 2,4-diﬂuorophenyl ring present in 19c is oriented toward the cox-2 secondary pocket in the vicinity of amino

acid residues val523, asp515, arg513, gln192, thr94, and
his90 (fig. 2). in this context, the distance between 4-ﬂuoro atom of the 2,4-diﬂuorophenyl ring and the nh2
(guanidino group) of arg513 is about 5.64 å, and it is
positioned about 5.90 å from the nh2 of gln192. the
2-ﬂuoro atom of the 2,4-diﬂuoro-phenyl ring is positioned near thr94, gly354, and tyr355 (distance < 5 å)
close to the entrance of the cox-2 secondary pocket.
pharmacological studies were carried out to assess the in
vivo antiinﬂammatory and analgesic activities of n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide (11), and some of the
most potent and selective cox-2 inhibitors (19c, 20b,
and 20c), based on in vitro enzyme inhibition data (see
data in table 2). in the carrageenan-induced rat paw
edema assay model, the parent compound 11 was the
most potent antiinﬂammatory agent (ed50 = 49 mg/kg)
within this group of compounds at 3 h postdrug administration (oral dose). this high in vivo antiinﬂammatory
activity shown by 11, relative to 19c, 20b, and 20c, is
attributed to the fact that 11 inhibits both cox-1 and
cox-2 whereas the latter compounds inhibit only
cox-2. credence for this explanation is based on observation that the more potent and selective in vitro cox-2
inhibitor n-acetyl-2-carboxy-4-(2,4-diﬂuorophenyl)benzenesulfonamide (19c) is a less potent antiinﬂammatory
agent in vivo (ed50 = 91 mg/kg, oral dose) than 11
(ed50 = 49 mg/kg, oral dose). these structure–
activity data indicate that the so2nhcome moiety
present in 11 is a suitable bioisostere, with respect to
antiinﬂammatory activity, of the acetoxy (ocome)

4. conclusions
in vitro cox-1/cox-2 isozyme inhibition, and in vivo
antiinﬂammatory and analgesic, data acquired for this
novel class of n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamides
showed that (i) the so2nhcoch3 moiety is a suitable
bioisostere of the oac substituent present in aspirin, (ii)
incorporation of a 2,4-diﬂuorophenyl substituent at the
c-4 position of n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide
provided the most potent (ic50 = 0.087 lm) and selective (s.i. >1149) inhibition of cox-2, and that this compound could serve as a useful probe to study the
function and catalytic activity of the cox-2 isozyme,
and (iii) a compound, which inhibits both cox-1 and
cox-2 such as n-acetyl-2-carboxybenzenesulfonamide
exhibits superior in vivo antiinﬂammatory activity relative to compounds that are more potent and selective
inhibitors of cox-2.

5.33. n-acetyl-2-methoxycarbonyl-5-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)benzenesulfonamide (21)
concentrated h2so4 (1.3 ml) was added dropwise at
ice-bath temperature to a stirred solution of 20d
(100 mg, 0.25 mmol) in methanol (15 ml). the reaction
mixture was reﬂuxed for 24 h, cooled to 25 c, and
ch2cl2 (100 ml) was added. this solution was washed
with water (30 ml), the organic fraction was dried
(na2so4), and the solvent was removed in vacuo to provide a white solid. this solid was acetylated in situ, following the procedure described previously for the
synthesis of compound 10, to aﬀord a crude product,
which was crystallized from hexanes–acetone to yield
the target product 21 as pale yellow crystals (80 mg,
77%); mp 217–218 c; ir (ﬁlm): 1721 (c@o), 1597,
