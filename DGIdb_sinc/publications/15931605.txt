abstract
alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the hgd gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2
dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (hga).  xxxd2735xxx , an
inhibitor of the enzyme  xxxg1071xxx , can drastically reduce urinary excretion of hga in individuals with
alkaptonuria. we investigated the safety and the hga-depleting efficacy of  xxxd2735xxx  in an open-label, single-center study of 9
alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. each patient received  xxxd2735xxx  in
incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months.  xxxd2735xxx  reduced
urinary hga levels from an average of 4.0 f 1.8 (sd) g/day to 0.2 f 0.2 g/day ( p b .001). the average plasma tyrosine concentration,
initially 68 f 18 lmol/l, rose to 760 f 181 lmol/l ( p b .001). during the final week of the study, 5 patients adhered to a proteinrestricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 f 167 to 603 f 114 lmol/l. six of the 7 patients who
received  xxxd2735xxx  for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no
signs of corneal toxicity. adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and
elevation of liver transaminase levels. we conclude that low-dose  xxxd2735xxx  effectively reduced urinary hga levels in patients with
alkaptonuria. future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of  xxxd2735xxx  in preventing joint deterioration and
providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.

1. introduction
alkaptonuria, an autosomal recessive disorder with an
incidence of approximately 1 in a million live births [1,2],
results from mutations in the gene hgd, which codes for an
essential hepatic enzyme, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase
[3-5]. this enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway
converts homogentisic acid (hga) to maleylacetoacetic
acid; the enzyme deficiency results in massive urinary
excretion of hga and accumulation of this compound in
the tissue of affected individuals. the urine turns dark upon

standing due to oxidation of hga to benzoquinones, which
form melanin-like polymers. these compounds bind preferentially to connective tissue, causing ochronosis, with its
darkening of ear cartilage, sclera, and bone, its arthritis and
joint destruction, and its cardiac valve disease [1,2].
treatment with  xxxd228xxx  to enhance hga degradation
has not proven helpful [6]. dietary therapy restricting
phenylalanine and tyrosine is difficult to maintain and has
had no demonstrable efficacy in improving the symptoms of
alkaptonuria, although long-term controlled clinical trials
have not been performed [1].
another possible approach to reducing hga production
involves the administration of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3cyclohexanedione, or  xxxd2735xxx  [7], a compound that inhibits  xxxg1071xxx 

720

p. suwannarat et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 54 (2005) 719 – 728

( xxxg1071xxx ), the enzyme that produces hga (fig. 1).
 xxxd2735xxx  is currently approved by the food and drug
administration for the treatment of tyrosinemia type i, a rare
disease caused by deficiency of  xxxg759xxx  and resulting in liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma,
and renal tubular dysfunction in infants and children [8].
 xxxd2735xxx  decreases the formation of toxic, oxidizing
metabolites in tyrosinemia type i children and constitutes
the treatment of choice for this otherwise fatal disease
[9,10]. in 2 patients with alkaptonuria, low-dose  xxxd2735xxx 
reduced the urinary excretion of hga by 69% or more [2].
however, plasma tyrosine concentrations rose significantly,
creating a risk of corneal crystal formation, corneal
epithelial damage, and photophobia.
in the present study, we examined the safety of
administering  xxxd2735xxx  at a dosage adequate to reduce
urinary hga excretion, typically 2 to 9 g/day in alkaptonuria patients [1,2], to 0.5 g/day or less. we hypothesized
that such a significant reduction, if maintained for years,
might retard the progression of joint disease in alkaptonuria
patients. we also incorporated a week of reduced dietary
protein into our protocol, to determine whether restriction of
tyrosine and phenylalanine would lower plasma tyrosine
levels in  xxxd2735xxx -treated patients. these investigations
were performed to provide a basis for future clinical trials of
 xxxd2735xxx  for the joint disease of alkaptonuria.

2.1. patients
nine patients (4 male and 5 female; aged 35-69 years)
were enrolled in an open-label clinical protocol to investigate the safety and hga-reducing efficacy of oral  xxxd2735xxx 
in alkaptonuria patients. the protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of the national human genome
research institute, and all patients gave written informed
consent. all patients were previously enrolled in a clinical
protocol to study the natural history of alkaptonuria. the
diagnosis of alkaptonuria in our 9 patients was based upon
the finding of urinary hga excretion in the range of 1.9 to
9.0 g/day (normal, 10-100 mg/day).
2.2. exclusion criteria
patients with keratopathy, current contact lens use, or
uncontrolled glaucoma were excluded from the study.
additional exclusion criteria included a history of myocardial infarction or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, tachycardia, bradycardia, left
bundle branch block, and chest radiographic abnormalities.
patients with history of pulmonary insufficiency, psychiatric
illness that interfered with compliance or communication,
current malignancy, open skin lesions, and uncontrolled
hypertension were not eligible. also excluded were patients
with significant anemia, thrombocytopenia or leucopenia,
hypokalemia, elevated serum creatinine, transaminase, or
creatine kinase levels, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, abnormal thyroid function tests, and plasma
tyrosine levels greater than 150 lmol/l.

individuals eligible for this study were admitted to the
warren g. magnuson clinical center at the national
institutes of health for an initial period of up to 4 weeks.
at the beginning of this period, baseline laboratory values,
electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, renal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and evaluations by
physical medicine and ophthalmology were obtained.  xxxd2735xxx , provided by swedish orphan international ab under
investigational new drug exemption #46865, was initiated
at an oral dose of 0.35 mg bid (approximately 0.01 mg/kg per
day) for 8 days. if the day-7 urinary hga excretion were less
than 0.5 g/day, the patient would be discharged on that dose;
otherwise, the  xxxd2735xxx  dose was increased to 1.05 mg bid
(approximately 0.03 mg/kg per day). if the day-15 hga
excretion were less than 0.5 g/day, no change in the dose
would be made; otherwise, the dose would be increased to a
dose of 4 mg bid (0.1 mg/kg per day). once an individual
reached his or her maintenance dose of  xxxd2735xxx , he or she
was discharged to maintain that dosage for up to 15 weeks;
during the last week of treatment, patients were placed on a
low protein diet of 40 g/day. patients returned to the nih
clinical center for weekly ophthalmologic examinations,

p. suwannarat et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 54 (2005) 719 – 728

24-hour urine collections for hga measurement, and serial
blood collections for laboratory analyses, including a
complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum
electrolytes and creatinine, liver function and mineral panels,
plasma amino acids, and  xxxd2735xxx  levels.
this protocol initially called for cessation of the clinical
trial if 3 serious adverse events occurred, regardless of
whether these events were considered related to  xxxd2735xxx 
use. a serious adverse event was defined by medical and
laboratory parameters determined a priori, including corneal
pain that interfered with daily living, new neurological or
cardiac involvement, a severe skin rash, serum alt greater
than 70 u/l, hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl, white blood cell
count less than 2.5 kg/ll, or serum potassium less than 3.0
or greater than 5.4 meq/l. the investigators met weekly
with a medical monitor not involved in the study to discuss
safety issues and help determine what should be considered
a serious adverse event.
2.4. rehabilitation analyses and measurements
all patients received a systematic musculoskeletal examination, consisting of joint and soft tissue assessment. axial
and large joints were palpated for pain, standard range of
motion (rom), and presence of effusion. quantitative spine
flexion (schober’s test) [11,12] was performed on all patients.
small joints of hands and feet were evaluated by inspection
and palpation. joint alignment abnormalities were noted.
each patient was issued a set of self-administered
questionnaires including the sf-36 (a general health survey)
[13,14], the human activity profile, the health assessment
questionnaire, and the fatigue assessment instrument. a
careful musculoskeletal history was obtained documenting
specifics of work and leisure activity, as well as injuries and
surgical procedures.
2.5. homogentisic acid assay
urinary hga levels were measured according to the
spectrophotometric method of lustberg et al [15], with
linearity in the range of 6 to 60 lmol/l. plasma hga was
measured using an hplc method developed for swedish
orphan international ab by aai deutschland gmbh & co
kg, neu-ulm, germany. briefly, 200 ll of plasma, 20 ll of
85% phosphoric acid, and 50 ll of internal standard (3,4dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 10 lg/ml) were mixed by
vortexing and 20 ll of 60% perchloric acid was added.
after 15 minutes  xxxd1891xxx  8c, the sample was centrifuged and
10 ll of 2 mol/l  xxxd228xxx  was added to 100 ll of the
supernatant. the extract was injected onto an hplc ultrasphere ods column ( beckman, fullerton, calif ) attached to
an spd-6a ultraviolet detector (shimadzu, kyoto, japan).
absorbance, measured at 286 nm, was linear with hga
concentration between 0.25 and 50.0 lg/ml.
2.6. plasma amino acid assay
plasma amino acid analyses were carried out using a
biochrom 30 (biochrom ltd, cambridge, england) cation-

721

exchange amino acid analyzer with post– column ninhydrin
detection [16].
2.7. plasma  xxxd2735xxx  assay
plasma  xxxd2735xxx  was quantified by liquid chromatography– electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry as
previously described [17], with linearity in the range of 0 to
152 lmol/l. these analyses were performed by the
biochemical genetics laboratory, children’s hospital and
regional medical center, seattle, wash.
2.8. dietary analyses
subjects were mailed detailed instructions to keep
baseline 3-day food records before their initial protocol
admission. throughout the 3- to 4-month treatment phase,
subjects continued to keep 2-day food records weekly while
they remained on a regular, ad libitum diet. a trained
dietitian reviewed all food records weekly for accuracy and
completeness, in person with each subject. for the last week
of the study, subjects were placed on a protein-restricted
diet (40 g/day); during this time, daily food records were
collected. food records (ie, those collected at baseline, 6
selected days during the treatment phase while on  xxxd2735xxx 
1.05 mg bid, and 3 days during the protein-restricted week)
were analyzed using the nutrition data system for
research software version 4.06/34, developed by the
nutrition coordinating center, university of minnesota,
minneapolis, minn [18].
3. results
3.1. patients
at baseline, the 9 patients under investigation had
elevated urinary hga excretion, normal plasma tyrosine
concentrations, and variable joint and aortic valve involvement (table 1). all patients continued to take medications
prescribed for preexisting conditions in addition to  xxxd2735xxx . of the 9 patients, 4 exited the study before its
conclusion, after 71, 5, 5, and 32 days, and 5 completed the
entire study, including the final week of a low-protein diet
(fig. 2). all patients required the first increment in
 xxxd2735xxx  dosing (from 0.35 to 1.05 mg bid), but no patient
required a second increment to reduce urinary hga
excretion below 0.5 g/day. the occurrence of 3 serious
adverse events in the first 5 patients, regardless of whether
or not they were related to nitisione use, necessitated halting
the study, in accordance with study requirements established
a priori. after a 9-week hiatus to allow a review of these
complications, enrollment was reinitiated for patients 6
through 9.
3.2. urinary homogentisic acid excretion
baseline daily urinary hga excretion before treatment
with  xxxd2735xxx  averaged 4.0 f 1.8 (sd) g/day (normal,
10-100 mg/day). after receiving  xxxd2735xxx  at a dose of

0.35 mg bid for 7 days, 7 patients exhibited a mean urinary
hga excretion of 1.4 f 1.0 g/day (fig. 3). in addition to
these 7 individuals, patients 4 and 5 also received the lowest
dose of  xxxd2735xxx , but for only 5 days. in patient 4, this
produced a 62% reduction in urinary hga excretion, from
3.4 to 1.3 g/day. in patient 5, it resulted in a 43% reduction
in urinary hga, from 2.8 to 1.6 g/day. all 9 patients
maintained a level of daily hga excretion above 0.5 g/day
while receiving 0.35 mg of  xxxd2735xxx  twice daily. for
7 patients, the  xxxd2735xxx  dosage was increased on day 8 to
1.05 mg bid; the mean urinary excretion of hga on day 15
was 0.23 f 0.09 g (fig. 3). the 7 patients were maintained
on the 1.05-mg bid dosage of  xxxd2735xxx  for 25 to 94 days.
during this time, the overall urinary hga levels averaged
223 f 238 mg/day on a regular diet (fig. 3). five patients
participated in the week-long low-protein diet, and all 5
exhibited lower urinary hga levels during this period,
with a mean of 124 f 42 mg/day.
3.3. plasma hga results
plasma hga levels were assayed in patients 1 to 3, 6, 8,
and 9. in patients 1 and 3, the plasma hga level was below
the limit of detection (0.25 lg/ml) even at baseline. all the
remaining patients had detectable concentrations of plasma
hga at baseline (ie, 0.47, 2.62, 1.25, 2.53 lg/ml in patients

the mean plasma tyrosine level at baseline on a regular
diet was 68 f 18 (sd) lmol/l (normal, 35-90 lmol/l), but

3.6. clinical and laboratory safety parameters
clinical and laboratory findings at baseline and at
specific times after starting  xxxd2735xxx  treatment are shown
in table 3. no signs of ocular toxicity were noted on weekly
ophthalmologic examinations in any of the patients.
neurological examinations were normal throughout the
treatment protocol, and mri scans of the brain before and
after treatment were normal. laboratory measures of
hematological, renal, hepatic, endocrine, and muscle function remained normal throughout the study. the high plasma
tyrosine concentrations resulting from  xxxd2735xxx  treatment
were not associated with changes in blood pressure or heart
rate (table 3). of the 7 patients receiving  xxxd2735xxx  at
1.05 mg bid, all noticed that their urine no longer darkened
on standing.
3.7. adverse events
four serious adverse events occurred and are described
below.
1. on day 38 of treatment, patient 1 experienced
vomiting and right flank pain. repeated abdominal
ct scans over the next 3 days revealed right and left
hydroureter and hydronephrosis, and the patient
passed several black kidney stones. a larger stone
was removed from the left ureter under cystoscopy
with lithotripsy on day 76. a temporary stent was

placed. with ongoing review of this case by the
medical monitor and the irb, the patient was
maintained on  xxxd2735xxx  treatment throughout the
course of these events.
2. patient 3 had a history of long-standing aortic stenosis
as a complication of her alkaptonuria. during the tenth
week of  xxxd2735xxx  treatment, she complained of
decreased activity tolerance and presyncopy. an
echocardiogram on day 74 of treatment showed critical
aortic stenosis with calcification of the aortic valve and
the mitral annulus. however, these results were
essentially unchanged compared with her echocardiographic findings upon enrollment. her electrocardiogram was also unchanged, and no orthostatic
alterations in blood pressure were apparent. nevertheless, based upon the subjective findings, cardiac
catheterization was performed and the patient’s aortic
valve was repaired. coronary artery bypass grafting
was performed at the same time. the operation
necessitated discontinuation of  xxxd2735xxx  after
10 weeks of treatment.
3. patient 4 had normal liver function tests upon
enrollment, with a serum ast of 31 u/l and alt of
34 u/l. two days after starting  xxxd2735xxx  (0.35 mg
bid), his ast was 49 u/l and his alt 46 u/l. by day
5, his ast was 75 u/l and alt 95 u/l. the bilirubin
and alkaline phosphatase, as well as all other blood
studies and the physical examination, remained
unchanged. because of protocol specifications classifying an alt greater than 70 u/l as a severe adverse
event, the patient was terminated from the protocol.
serum liver function values peaked on day 8 (alt
117 u/l, ast 94 u/l) and returned to normal 3 weeks

later. infectious causes of hepatitis were excluded, and
the serum creatine kinase, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, and  xxxg520xxx  remained normal. the
serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase was mildly
elevated at 95 u/l (normal, 11-52). the patient had
a history of heavy alcohol use in the past. although he
denied current alcohol use, he was receiving several
other potentially hepatotoxic medications including
lovastatin, ibuprofen, omeprazole, and oxycodone/
acetaminophen.
4. patient 7 entered the  xxxd2735xxx  protocol with an alt of
25 u/l and an ast of 16 u/l. serum liver enzymes
remained low until day 32, when the alt was 144 u/l
and the ast 58 u/l. the serum gamma–glutamyltranspeptidase and alkaline phosphatase were never
elevated, and other laboratory studies remained normal.  xxxd2735xxx  was discontinued on day 32 because
the protocol then considered an alt greater than
100 u/l to represent severe toxicity. alt levels
returned to normal within 1 week after stopping the
medication. the patient had a past history of heavy
alcohol and drug use. he was also receiving a variety
of medications at the time of the adverse event,
including oxycodone/acetaminophen, docusate sodium,  xxxd3159xxx ,  xxxd2145xxx /salmeterol inhalation powder, fluticasone
nasal spray, and albuterol. he had completed a course
of azithromycin for an episode of acute bronchitis
2 days before the elevation in transaminases.
3.8. dietary analysis
mean dietary protein at baseline and during the
maintenance phase of the study while patients had an

p. suwannarat et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 54 (2005) 719 – 728

unrestricted diet was 80.2 g/day; the median intake was
62.6 g/day (n = 7). all patients ingested more than 40 g of
protein daily. the subset of patients who adhered to a
restricted protein diet for the last week of the study had a
mean protein intake of 57.6 g/day while on a regular diet and
33 g/day while on the low-protein diet (table 3). the average
intakes of phenylalanine and tyrosine were 3.5 and 2.9 g/day,
respectively, on a regular diet and 1.4 and 1.2 g/day,
respectively, on the restricted protein diet.
3.9. individual patients
patient 1, a 53-year-old woman, passed bilateral renal
stones after 5 weeks of treatment (see adverse event 1) and
developed transient mild elevations in hepatic transaminase
levels (alt 60 u/l, normal 6-41; ast 46 u/l, normal 9-34)
after 10 weeks of treatment with  xxxd2735xxx  (1.05 mg bid).
the transaminase values returned to normal without intervention. despite the renal lithiasis, this patient continued to
receive  xxxd2735xxx  for 13 weeks, including the final week on a
protein restricted diet. during the study, this patient reported
a generalized improvement in rom and a decrease in joint
pain. quantitative spine flexion (schober’s test) showed an
improvement in rom from 10.5 to 11.4 cm. on musculoskeletal examination, the patient showed an increase in
shoulder external rotation on the right from 628 to 748 and on
the left from 568 to 728. these increases are clinically
significant and likely to result in functional improvement.
patient 2, a 50-year-old woman, noticed that her skin was
drier than usual, although her physical examination was
normal. she also noticed decreased pigmentation of her
cerumen after 3 weeks of high dose  xxxd2735xxx  treatment.
this patient completed 14 weeks of  xxxd2735xxx , including a
final week of dietary protein restriction. she experienced
decreased pain in her back and decreased pain medication
requirements. she also reported improved energy levels
while receiving  xxxd2735xxx .
patient 3, a 69-year-old woman, underwent aortic valve
repair during the course of the protocol (see adverse event
2), causing discontinuation of  xxxd2735xxx  after 10 weeks of
treatment. she complained of dry, flaky skin, and physical
examination revealed several erythematous scaling lesions
which improved with moisturizing lotion. she also reported
flatulence and occasional loose stools that improved after
stopping  xxxd2735xxx . liver transaminase levels were mildly
and transiently elevated (alt 48 u/l; ast 45 u/l). this
patient reported improved rom and decreased pain levels.
she also had decreased pain medication requirements and
reported improved energy levels.
patient 4, a 46-year-old man, developed elevated
transaminase levels (alt 95 u/l, ast 75 u/l) after
receiving  xxxd2735xxx , 0.35 mg bid, for 5 days (see adverse
event 3), and  xxxd2735xxx  was discontinued immediately.
patient 5, a 41-year-old man, was enrolled at the same
time as patient 4. he did not develop an adverse event
related to  xxxd2735xxx . however, because of the occurrence of
the study’s third adverse event in patient 4, the protocol was

725

temporarily suspended and patient 5 was required to stop
 xxxd2735xxx  treatment. after amendments were made to the
protocol, this patient was not able to return to the nih to
resume the study.
patient 6, a 64-year-old woman, developed mild anemia in
the middle of the study and responded well to iron
supplementation. she completed 13 weeks of  xxxd2735xxx 
therapy, including a final week on a protein restricted diet.
this patient reported decreased pain and improved rom in
her back and major joints. she also had decreased pain
medication requirements. schober’s test showed an improvement in the range of spine flexion from 13.0 to 13.3 cm. on
musculoskeletal examination, the patient showed an increase
in knee flexion rom from 1058 to 1128 on the right and from
1008 to 1138 on the left. the patient’s left knee flexion
contracture also decreased from 78 to 08. the increase in knee
extension is clinically significant.
patient 7, a 35-year-old man, developed elevated transaminase levels on day 32 of treatment, at which point
 xxxd2735xxx  was discontinued and not restarted (see adverse
event 4). he reported decreased levels of pain throughout his
back, hips, and knees, and improved rom along with
decreased pain medication requirements. schober’s test
showed an improvement in the rom from 12.4 to 13.4 cm.
on musculoskeletal examination, the patient showed an
increase in shoulder internal rotation from 488 bilaterally to
full rom on the right and 678 on the left, and an increase in
shoulder external rotation from 628 to 748 on the right and
from 568 to 728 on the left. however, the patient also showed
a clinically significant decrease in knee flexion from 1308
bilaterally to 928 on the right and 1058 on the left.
patient 8, a 55-year-old woman, developed mild anemia
after approximately 1 month on study. the anemia
improved with iron supplementation. she also had elevated
transaminase levels after 8 weeks of  xxxd2735xxx , with peak
levels at 11 weeks (alt 55 u/l; ast 43 u/l). this patient
completed 15 weeks of  xxxd2735xxx , including the final week
on a protein restricted diet. she reported decreased pain in
her large joints, lower back, and cervical area during
treatment with  xxxd2735xxx .
patient 9, a 44-year-old man, completed 15 weeks of
 xxxd2735xxx  including a final week on a protein-restricted diet.
he reported no change in his level of pain or mobility during
 xxxd2735xxx  treatment. schober’s test showed a decrease in the
range of spine flexion from 13.2 to 12.2 cm. the patient had
an epidural lumbar spine injection of cortisone because of a
history of chronic, diffuse thoracic, and lumbosacral spine
pain. on musculoskeletal examination, the patient showed a
clinically significant increase in shoulder external rotation
from 708 to 908 bilaterally.
4. discussion
the devastating clinical repercussions of alkaptonuria
include the destruction of vertebral disks, major joints, and
cardiac valves, the formation of renal and prostatic stones,

726

p. suwannarat et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 54 (2005) 719 – 728

and calcification of the coronary arteries [1]. progressive
degenerative arthritis (ochronosis) of the spine and large
appendicular joints often leads to progressive impairments,
such as kyphosis, arthritis, and loss of motion often
requiring joint replacement. the combination of aging and
these impairments frequently lead to progressive functional
decline in daily routines and ambulation difficulties [19,20].
disability, especially in those who are in the sixth decade,
often necessitates a change in vocational status and
avocational activity.
for these complications, which require 5 to 6 decades to
develop [2], the only available treatments are symptomatic
(ie, joint and valve replacements and surgical removal of
stones). no therapy directed at the basic metabolic defect,
whether  xxxd228xxx  or dietary protein restriction, has
proven beneficial in controlling the insidious accumulation
of hga and its oxidation byproducts within the tissues of
alkaptonuria patients.
theoretically,  xxxd2735xxx  administration should address the
basic problem in alkaptonuria by inhibiting the production of
hga via the tyrosine degradation pathway (fig. 1). practically,  xxxd2735xxx  must first be shown safe and effective in this
regard, and an appropriate dosage regimen must be determined. fortunately, substantial experience exists with  xxxd2735xxx  use, albeit largely in children with tyrosinemia type i, a
fatal liver disease due to deficiency of an enzyme in the distal
portion of the tyrosine degradation pathway (fig. 1).
since 1992,  xxxd2735xxx  has proven well-tolerated for
short- and long-term use in tyrosinemia type i at a dosage
of approximately 1 mg/kg per day [9]. however,  xxxd2735xxx 
operates several steps before the basic defect in tyrosinemia type i. because  xxxd2735xxx  inhibits the very reaction
that produces hga, a lower dosage may suffice. in fact,
our incremental dosing scheme revealed that as little as
0.03 mg/kg per day (2.1 mg/day) uniformly and reproducibly reduced urinary hga by 94% to approximately
220 mg/day (fig. 3). at the same time, plasma hga fell
below the limit of detectability in all 4 patients who had
detectable levels at baseline. if high hga concentrations in
alkaptonuric joints are achieved by high circulating hga
levels, the lowering of plasma hga levels by  xxxd2735xxx 
provides critical support for the value of this drug in
treating alkaptonuric joint disease. furthermore, the salutary
effects of treatment were achieved at plasma  xxxd2735xxx 
levels of 1.4 lmol/l compared with the levels of 50 to
60 lmol/l achieved in tyrosinemia type i patients [17]. we
employed twice daily dosing because that regimen was used
in tyrosinemia type i, but a single daily dose should be
sufficient. single-dose half-time data obtained in normal
adult volunteers have indicated prolonged effects of the drug,
with a t 1/2 of 54 hours [21], and plasma  xxxd2735xxx  concentrations plateaued in our patients between weeks 1 and 12 on
1.05 mg bid.
a difficult question arose regarding whether to restrict the
protein intake of alkaptonuria patients receiving  xxxd2735xxx .
patients with tyrosinemia type i observe a phenylalanine and

tyrosine-restricted diet during  xxxd2735xxx  treatment to minimize the elevation of plasma tyrosine, with a target plasma
tyrosine concentration less than 400 lmol/l [8]. complying
with this restricted diet is extremely difficult, especially when
started in adulthood. nevertheless, we wanted to know how
much a mild protein restriction would lower plasma tyrosine
levels in our alkaptonuria patients, in case such a regimen
would be useful in the future. in 5 alkaptonuria patients
treated with  xxxd2735xxx , protein restriction during the last
week of treatment did reduce plasma tyrosine levels, from
755 to 603 lmol/l. although all patients showed a reduction
in their tyrosinemia, only patient 9 achieved plasma tyrosine
levels in the 400 lmol/l range (table 3). furthermore, most
of the patients had reported some difficulty adhering to the
restricted diet.
a rare but important complication of  xxxd2735xxx  use is
ophthalmic irritation. affected patients experience itching,
burning, photophobia, corneal damage, and, rarely, corneal
crystal formation. these symptoms resolve within a few days
of strict limitation of phenylalanine and tyrosine intake [22].
the ophthalmic involvement is considered related to
elevated plasma tyrosine levels, based upon experience in
other hypertyrosinemic states. a keratopathy accompanies
elevated plasma tyrosine levels in humans with tyrosinemia
type ii, due to  xxxg2250xxx  deficiency (fig. 1).
in such patients, with initial tyrosine concentrations between
734 and 2826 lmol/l, ophthalmic findings resolved with
dietary restriction of tyrosine sufficient to reduce tyrosine
levels to 280 to 879 lmol/l [23]. on the other hand, some
tyrosinemic states lack ophthalmic involvement. persons
with tyrosinemia type iii, which results from  xxxg1071xxx 
deficiency (fig. 1), have plasma tyrosine levels of 500 to
1300 lmol/l but no ophthalmic complications [24]. in a
series of 11 patients with tyrosinemia type i, treated with
 xxxd2735xxx  and a low tyrosine diet, median plasma tyrosine
levels ranged between 206 and 900 lmol/l; the highest level
was 1410 lmol/l. in this group, no patient developed ocular
symptoms and ophthalmic examinations were normal [22].
in our series of patients with alkaptonuria, treated with
 xxxd2735xxx  for 3 to 4 months, there were no ocular complications observed on weekly ophthalmic examinations. this
was true despite elevated mean plasma tyrosine levels of 472
to 901 lmol/l (table 2) and no dietary restriction.
the absence of ocular complications in our patients
could occur for several reasons. a possible explanation is
that we did not study enough patients for a long enough time
to see the toxicity of hypertyrosinemia. in addition, the
plasma tyrosine levels in our patients may not have been as
high, chronically, as in tyrosinemia type i patients experiencing corneal irritation. another possibility is that the low
dose of  xxxd2735xxx  we employed, and the low plasma levels
achieved, may have reflected low concentrations of  xxxd2735xxx  in corneal epithelial cells, where local tyrosine
production could potentially cause the keratopathy. finally,
our adult patients may be less susceptible than children to
keratopathies related to high plasma tyrosine levels.

p. suwannarat et al. / metabolism clinical and experimental 54 (2005) 719 – 728

another potential side effect of  xxxd2735xxx  consists of the
development of neurological problems related to hypertyrosinemia. this has been proposed because  xxxd2735xxx 
blocks  xxxg1071xxx , deficiency of which results in tyrosinemia
type iii, a disorder possibly associated with neurological
problems [8]. however, none of our patients developed any
neurological complications, and mri scans of the brain
before and after the treatment regimen were normal (table 3).
in addition, there were no clinical or laboratory abnormalities
attributable to  xxxd2735xxx  therapy.
although there appeared to be no serious hypertyrosinemia-related side effects in this study, there were 4 severe
adverse events. these bore different degrees of relatedness
to the  xxxd2735xxx  treatment. we think that the passing of
renal stones in patient 1, already present as a complication
of alkaptonuria itself, could have been related to  xxxd2735xxx 
treatment. it is possible that the decrease in urinary hga
concentration attendant to  xxxd2735xxx  treatment led to the
dissolution of already present calculi and resulted in their
passage. this could be considered both an adverse event and
a long-term benefit of  xxxd2735xxx  therapy.
the worsening of aortic stenosis symptoms in patient 3 is
unlikely to be related to  xxxd2735xxx  treatment. no objective
signs of disease progression were appreciated, and the
patient’s presence in a hospital setting, with attention to
medical complications, may have prompted this patient to
recognize her long-standing symptoms.
we cannot eliminate the possibility that the elevations in
serum transaminases seen in our patients were related to
 xxxd2735xxx  treatment. two patients, 4 and 7, had approximately 2- to 3-fold elevations, consistent with the range for
btransaminitisq [25,26]; both had a strong history of alcohol
use in the past. both were also receiving multiple
medications, some of which have known or potential
hepatotoxicity. several other patients reported mild alcohol
intake during the course of treatment and were on similar
types of medications, including statins. none of these
patients had severe elevations of alt or ast. in addition,
3 patients (1, 3, and 8) developed mild transient elevations
of alt and ast. we consider that the transaminase
elevations seen in our patients were likely multifactorial
effects related to prior liver damage and concomitant
medications use, exacerbated by  xxxd2735xxx .
mild adverse events may or may not have been related to
 xxxd2735xxx  use. these included anemia which resolved with
iron supplementation and the development of dry skin with
areas of scaling. we note that individuals with tyrosinemia
type ii, in addition to ocular findings, have skin manifestations. these include painful hyperkeratotic plaques on the
palms, soles, and plantar surface of the digits [8]. the
lesions in our patient were not painful and were not
localized to the hands and feet, suggesting that they were
likely unrelated to the hypertyrosinemia.
subjective salutary effects included decreased joint
pain and medication requirements and improved mobility
in 6 patients. incidental findings were recognition of a

727

normal colored urine on standing and lighter cerumen in
7 patients.
in conclusion,  xxxd2735xxx  at a dosage of 1.05 mg bid
reduced by 94% the urinary homogentisic acid excretion of
patients with alkaptonuria. four of 4 patients with detectable
plasma hga at baseline had undetectable hga after
 xxxd2735xxx  treatment; this effect was associated with increased
plasma tyrosine levels, but minimal toxic effects. specifically, ophthalmic and neurological complications did not occur
during short-term therapy without dietary protein restriction.
however, 2 patients with other risk factors for hepatotoxicity
exhibited transiently elevated serum transaminase levels. it
remains to be determined whether reducing daily hga
production to approximately 200 mg is sufficient to retard
progression of ochronosis in alkaptonuria patients. longterm clinical studies are planned to delineate the benefits of
 xxxd2735xxx  in reducing arthritis and other complications of
alkaptonuria. close monitoring of treated individuals, with
special attention to hepatotoxicity, will be critical to
determine the full spectrum of side effects.
