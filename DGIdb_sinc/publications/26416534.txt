abstract
background and objectives  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò ( xxxd2443xxx  depot in the usa) has demonstrated anti-tumor
activity and control of the symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in patients with neuroendocrine
tumors. the objectives of this study were to describe the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò administered
4-weekly by deep subcutaneous injections of 60, 90, or
120 mg in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (gep-nets), to quantify the magnitude of
inter-patient variability (ipv), and to identify those patient
characteristics that impact on pharmacokinetics.
methods analyses were based on pooled data from
clinical trials. a total of 1541 serum concentrations from
290 patients were analyzed simultaneously by the population approach using nonmemò version 7.2. covariates
evaluated included demographics, renal and hepatic function markers, and disease-related parameters.
results serum profiles were described by a one-compartment disposition model in which the absorption process

was characterized by two parallel pathways following firstand zero-order kinetics. the estimated apparent volume of
distribution was 18.3 l. the estimated apparent total
serum clearance for a typical 74 kg patient was 513 l/day,
representing a substantial difference in clearance in this
population of patients with respect to healthy volunteers
that could not be explained by any of the covariates tested.
body weight was the only covariate to show a statistically
significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profile, but due to
the overlap between the pharmacokinetic profiles of
patients with lower or higher body weights the effect of
body weight on clearance was not considered clinically
relevant. the ipv was low for clearance (27 %) and
moderate to high for volume of distribution (150 %) and
the absorption constant (61 %).
conclusions using two mechanisms of absorption, the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò were well-described in patients with gep-net. none of the patient
characteristics tested were of clinical relevance to potential
dose adjustment in clinical practice.

key points
a population pk model for  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò has
been established in patients with
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
elimination of  xxxd2443xxx  in this type of patient
population is reduced compared to healthy
volunteers and patients with acromegaly.
body weight showed statistical effect of the apparent
total clearance which was not considered clinically
relevant.

1 background
somatostatin analogs are the treatment of choice for hormonerelated syndromes associated with functioning neuroendocrine tumors (nets), such as carcinoid syndrome.  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò (known as  xxxd2443xxx  depot in the usa) is a
synthetic octapeptide analog of somatostatin with a longer
half-life than the native molecule and with selectivity for
somatostatin receptor (sstr) 2 and, to a lesser extent,
sstr 5 [1].  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò was launched in the uk in
2001 and is now approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for indications including acromegaly and clinical
symptoms associated with nets, and also for improvement of
progression-free survival in patients with unresectable, wellor moderately differentiated, and locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic nets (gep-nets) [2].
the pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò
in healthy volunteers and patients with acromegaly have
been reported previously [3]. this formulation, subcutaneously injected, acts as depot providing a slow and controlled release over 4 weeks with 60–70 % absolute
bioavailability (f). the apparent volume of distribution
(vd/f) and the total clearance were estimated to be 15 l
and 23 l/h, respectively, and were not modified by repeat
dosing.  xxxd2443xxx  is thought to be eliminated mainly by
renal metabolism and biliary excretion, and the renal serum
clearance of  xxxd2443xxx  was found to be reduced in patients
with severe chronic renal insufficiency when compared
with healthy subjects [4].
to date, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò in
patients with functioning and non-functioning gep-nets has
not been reported. such evaluation is essential for both dose
adjustment and a complete understanding of clinical response
to treatment. the objectives of the current analysis were to
describe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of deep subcutaneous injections of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò administered as 60,
90, or 120 mg every 4 weeks in patients with functioning and
non-functioning gep-nets, to quantify the degree of interpatient variability (ipv) in the pharmacokinetic parameters,
and to identify patient characteristics that may influence the
pharmacokinetic properties. data from four clinical studies of
patients with gep-nets were pooled to determine the influence of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and
disease parameters on the ipv of the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2443xxx  autogelò in this patient population.

use—good clinical practice (ich–gcp) and local legislation. all studies were performed in accordance with the
declaration of helsinki and were approved by the institutional
review board of the ethics committee at each study site.
2.1 overview of clinical study designs
2.1.1 study 1: clarinet
clarinet (controlled study of  xxxd2443xxx  antiproliferative response in neuroendocrine tumors) [5] was a
phase iii, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study conducted over 96 weeks in 204 patients at 48 centers worldwide;  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg was administered every 4 weeks in patients with non-functioning
gep-nets.
serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations were measured at (1)
baseline; (2) 4 weeks before first drug administration; (3)
between the first and second injections (between week 1 and
week 4): patients were randomized 1:1 to either (a) two
blood samples at 4 h (range 2–12 h) and 7 days (range
6–8 days) after drug administration or (b) two blood samples
at 3 days (range 2–4 days) and 14 days (range 12–16 days)
after drug administration; (4) between the sixth and seventh
injections (between week 20 and week 24) using the same
schedule as described in (3); and (5) prior to drug administration at all treatment period visits including completion or
withdrawal. putative anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies were measured at weeks 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96.
2.1.2 study 2: elect
elect [6] was a phase iii–iv 48-week study consisting of
a 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
phase in which  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg or placebo was
administered, followed by a 32-week initial open-label
phase in which all patients received  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò.
patients with gastrointestinal nets and a history of carcinoid syndrome (n = 115) were randomly allocated to
study drug or placebo at 39 centers worldwide.
serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations and putative anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies were measured at week 16 before and
4 h (±2 h) after drug administration, at week 20 before
drug administration, and at the end of the initial open-label
phase (week 48).
2.1.3 study 3

2 methods
all patients provided written informed consent consistent with
the international conference on harmonization of technical
requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human

a phase ii, single-arm, open-label study was conducted at
17 spanish centers [7]. patients (n = 30) with progressive
functioning/non-functioning gastrointestinal, pancreatic,
and lung nets received  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg every
4 weeks over b92 weeks, to a maximum of 23 injections.

population pk analysis of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò

serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations and putative anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies were measured before drug administration and every 12 weeks from week 8 to week 92.
2.1.4 study 4
an open-label, dose-titration study was conducted in
patients with symptomatic carcinoid nets (n = 71) [8].
 xxxd2443xxx  autogelò was given at titrated doses every
4 weeks over 6 months: the first two injections were of
90 mg, after which the dose was increased to 120 mg in
patients who did not respond to treatment and decreased to
60 mg in those who did respond. patients on 120 mg
remained at that dose, others continued the titration scheme
until study end.
serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations were measured before
drug administration and every 4 weeks from week 4 to
week 24.
2.2 bio-analytical method
serum  xxxd2443xxx  was measured by using a validated
radioimmunoassay[4] with a lower limit of quantification
of 0.078 ng/ml, overall precision (inter- and intra-assay)
and reproducibility expressed as percentage coefficient of
variation (cv) of 2.3–13.6 %, and a cv of 6.2–13.2 % for
concentrations in the range 0.1–10 ng/ml. accuracy was
[89 %. when stored at -20 °c, serum  xxxd2443xxx  was
stable for 28 months.
2.3 study population
all patients providing at least one valid serum concentration and receiving active treatment with  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò were included in the analysis.
covariates included in the population pharmacokinetic
analysis were age,  xxxg941xxx  (spgt), serum
albumin (alb), anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies, aspartate
aminotransferase (sgot), body weight (bw), body mass
index (bmi), creatinine clearance (clcr) calculated using
the cockroft-gault expression, ethnicity (race), functioning/non-functioning classification of the endocrine
tumor (fntc), gender (sex), total bilirubin (bili), cholecystectomy (cyst), and primary tumor location (tloc).
2.4 population pharmacokinetic model building
data were transformed logarithmically and nonmemò
version 7.2 [9] software (icon development solutions,
ellicott city, md, usa), using first-order conditional
estimation and the interaction option, was used to fit
all serum concentration data simultaneously. model
development was performed in three steps: (1) a base

population model, defined as a population model providing
proper data description without incorporating covariates,
was built; (2) the covariate model was developed by
selecting those patient characteristics that showed significant impact on the model parameters; and (3) the selected
model was evaluated.
ipv was modeled exponentially. non-diagonal elements of
the x variance–covariance matrix were also considered. as
full pharmacokinetic profiles were not obtained in all studies
at every visit, inter-occasion variability was not considered.
residual variability was modeled considering an additive
error in the logarithmic domain of the transformed data.
2.4.1 model selection criteria
selection between models was based on the evaluation of
different statistical and graphical criteria: precision of
parameter estimates obtained from the analysis of 1000
bootstrap datasets using the software perl-speaks-nonmem (psn) [10], goodness-of-fit plots, and minimum
value of the objective function value provided by
nonmemò and approximately equal to -2 9 log (likelihood) (-2ll). differences between two hierarchical
(nested) models were compared with a chi squared (v2)
distribution in which a decrease of 3.84, 6.63, 7.88, or
11.87 points in -2ll was considered significant at the 5, 1,
0.5, and 0.1 % levels for one extra parameter in the model,
respectively. non-nested models were compared using the
akaike information criteria (aic) [11] calculated as 2ll ? 2 9 np, where np is the number of parameters in
the model. the model with the lowest value of aic, given
the precision of model parameters and an adequate
description of the data, was selected.
2.4.2 base population model
because of the complex absorption profile of  xxxd2443xxx  in
healthy volunteers [3], the initial model consisted of an
absorption model including two input parallel mechanisms
accounting for first- and zero-order rate input processes each
associated with a corresponding latency time. other
absorption models including two parallel first-order processes, or simpler models such as the zero- or first-order input
models were also explored. drug disposition was described
by compartmental models parameterized in apparent volumes of distribution and elimination clearances.
2.4.3 covariate model development
covariate selection was performed using the stepwise
covariate modeling (scm) implemented in the psn software [10]. significance levels were set to 0.05 and 0.005
for the forward inclusion and backward deletion

n. buil-bruna et al.

approaches, respectively. the stepwise modeling selection
approach was performed with the covariate information
gathered at baseline. for those covariates that changed
during the period of the study and were significant in the
scm, the impact of that change on pharmacokinetics was
evaluated [12].
2.4.4 final model evaluation
the final model was challenged to determine whether
further simplification was possible, or if there were aspects
that could be improved. parameter precision was evaluated
by performing 1000 non-parametric bootstrap analyses
using psn [10] and xpose [13].
the selected model was evaluated by performing predictive checks based on computer simulation exercises. a
total of 500 datasets with the same study design characteristics as the original were simulated. the 2.5th, 50th, and
97.5th percentiles of the simulated observations in each
dataset were computed for all time intervals and the 95 %
prediction interval of each calculated percentile was
obtained and plotted against the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th
percentiles obtained from the raw data.
individual serum concentrations were simulated and the
following pharmacokinetic descriptors were obtained:
maximum serum concentration (cmax), minimum serum
concentration (cmin), average serum concentration within
the dosing interval (cavg), and the area under the serum
concentration–time curve (auc) within the dosing interval
at steady state (aucs).
the summary statistics of the pharmacokinetic
descriptors defined above were performed for the whole
population and sub-categories of the population: (1) body
weight b62, c70 to b77, and c89 kg; (2) gender. those
three categories were chosen as they correspond to the
20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles of the weight distribution
in the studied population.

open-label phase) and 45 in the open-label phase randomized to placebo], and 30 patients (study 3) received
 xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg, corresponding to 793, 286,
and 111 serum samples, respectively. in the dose-titration
study (study 4), a total of 71 patients received the 60 mg
(n = 17), 90 mg (n = 67), and/or 120 mg (n = 46) doses
from which 57, 148, and 146 corresponding serum concentration values were derived.
eleven serum  xxxd2443xxx  samples obtained from six
patients revealed the presence of anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies
at concentrations of  xxxd2443xxx  of 4.7–8.19 ng/ml.
figure 1 shows individual serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentration as a function of time for each clinical trial. no outliers
were identified.
3.2 covariates tested for significance
covariates tested for significance are listed in table 1. a
number of patients were missing information for bw (2),
clcr (2), and bmi (86). bmi was not tested for significant
covariate effects. for the two patients with bw and clcr
values missing, covariate effects were ignored. the three
non-continuous covariates tested were sex, fntc, and
tloc. as the majority of the patients were white, race
was not tested as a significant covariate.
most continuous covariates changed for individual
subjects over the course of the studies. the cv was calculated for each continuous covariate, and varied up to
108 % (bili).
exploratory analysis of the covariates revealed that, as
expected, there were apparent correlations between bw
and clcr, and between age and clcr (data not shown).
the number of patients with normal renal function
([90 ml/min) was 130, while the number of patients with
mild (60–89 ml/min), moderate (30–59 ml/min), or severe (\30 ml/min) renal impairment was 100, 58, and 2,
respectively.

3.3.1 base population model
3.1 description of the data
patients received a median (range) of 24 (1–24), 18 (2–74),
12 (2–12), and 24 (4–46)  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò injections in
studies 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. analyses were performed on 1541 serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentration values
from 290 patients. the number of samples per patient
ranged from 1 to 11, with mean values ranging approximately from three to eight samples between the different
clinical trials.
a total of 101 (study 1), 104 [study 2; comprising 59 in
the double-blind phase (56 of whom continued to the initial

attempts to model the absorption process using zero-, first-,
or two parallel first-order inputs yielded a poorer description of the data than the model based on two parallel
mechanisms representing first- and zero-order rate input
processes (p \ 0.001). inclusion of the latency times
associated with each input mechanism did not improve the
fit significantly (p [ 0.05).
as drug disposition was described equally well by the
one-compartment model and the more complex two-compartment model (p [ 0.05), the former was selected for
further development. the structure of the population

pharmacokinetic model selected for  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò is
represented schematically in fig. 2.
ipv was included on the first-order rate constant of
absorption (ka), the vd/f, apparent total serum clearance
(cl/f), and the fraction of the dose absorbed following the
first-order rate process (f1). the fraction of the absorbed
dose following a zero-order process (f2) was calculated as
1 - f1. inclusion of ipv on f and on the parameter representing the duration of the zero-order rate input process
(d0) did not affect the results significantly (p [ 0.05).
similar results were obtained when the non-diagonal elements of the x variance–covariance matrix were estimated
(p [ 0.05).
typical estimates corresponding to f1 and f2 were 98.5
and 1.5 %, respectively. the zero-order rate process takes
place during the first 2.96 days after injection, and the firstorder input process occurs slowly with a ka of
0.0161 day-1, corresponding to a half-life of 43.6 days.
cl/f and vd/f were 516 l/day and 20.2 l, respectively.
the estimates of ipv were 2.5 % (f1), 61 % (ka), 33 %
(cl/f), and 142 % (vd/f).

for some parameters (vd/f, ka, and f1) in the model the
percentage shrinkage was high ([20 %), indicating that the
empirical bayes estimates were not informative [14]. no
major trends were identified in the goodness-of-fit plots and
parameters were estimated with high precision (data not
shown).
3.3.2 covariate model selection
the set of covariates tested for each parameter in the model
were: (1) cl/f * sex, age, bw, sgpt, sgot, bili,
alb, clcr, tloc, fctn; (2) vd/f * sex, age, bw,
bili, alb, tloc, fctn; (3) ka * sex, age, bw; and
(4) f1 * sex, age, bw. these choices were based on
standard pharmacokinetic principles taking into account
route of administration. for continuous covariates, both
linear and non-linear relationships were explored.
the selected full covariate model obtained in the forward-inclusion approach comprised the following covariate
effects: (1) bw and sex on f1; and (2) bw, tloc, age,
and bili on cl/f.

for the effects of sex on f1, the final covariate model
provided estimates of f1 for males and females of 0.974
and 0.994, respectively, which has a negligible effect on f1
but a large impact on f2 [2.6 9 10-2 (males), 6 9 10-3
(females)], the derived parameter governing cmax values.
bw rather than clcr was selected for cl/f; although
both covariates were highly correlated, the dataset contained 14 clcr values [150 ml/min (these were probably
non-physiological).
the covariate effects of bili and age were not significant (p [ 0.05) once the covariate tloc was removed
from the model, but the effect of bw on cl/f continued to
be significant (p \ 0.001).
changes in bw during the study were accounted for by
using the approach suggested by wählby et al. [12]. the
value of -2ll was reduced by 7.96 points, but there was
no reduction in ipv and the remaining parameters
remained unchanged. the dose of  xxxd2443xxx  administered
appeared to have no effect on cl/f (p [ 0.05). estimates
of cl/f for the 60 and 90 mg doses were increased by 13
and 24 %, respectively, when compared with the 120 mg
dose, indicating the absence of a monotonic relationship
between cl/f and dose. however, the number of patients
receiving 60 and 90 mg was far lower than the number
receiving the 120 mg dose of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò.
table 2 lists the corresponding estimates of the model
parameters. goodness-of-fit plots are shown in electronic
supplementary material figure s1.
according to the selected model, the mean vd/f was
18.3 l (no effects of covariates were found for vd/f). the
mean cl/f was 513 l/day for a 74 kg subject, and the
mean ka was 0.0159 day-1, corresponding to an absorption

half-life of 43.6 days. ipv of cl/f decreased from 33 to
27 % in comparison with the base population model when
bw measured at the beginning of the study was included as
a covariate. incorporation of sex effects on f1 reduced the
ipv of f1 from 2.5 to 1.05 %. the ipv value that is
marginal with respect to f1 has a non-negligible impact on
individual differences in f2. ipv was moderate for all
parameters with the exception of vd/f. typical population
estimates of the different parameters were very similar
between the base model and the final model.
results of the bootstrap analysis indicated that all
parameters in the model were estimated with adequate
precision. g-shrinkage values were [20 % and the eshrinkage was 17.5 %. one explanation for the high
shrinkage percentage values is that there were few datapoints in two of the clinical trials evaluated. the substantial
shrinkage values reported in table 2 indicate that (1)
empirical bayes estimates should not be used to drive the
covariate selection process; and (2) the individual predictions versus observations plot is uninformative, and other
type of model diagnostics are advisable.
figure 3 shows the results of the prediction-corrected
visual predictive checks. the model performs adequately in
capturing the central trend and the spread of the data for
each of the clinical trials. individual  xxxd2443xxx  serum
concentration profiles for a sample of patients from each of
the four clinical trials are shown in electronic supplementary material figure s2.
the relationship between conditional weighted residuals
and individual covariate values is illustrated in electronic
supplementary material figure s3, demonstrating the
absence of trends when bw and sex were incorporated as
selected covariates for cl/f and f1 in the final model.
3.4 exploration of covariate effects
figure 4 explores the covariate effects of bw and sex on
serum  xxxd2443xxx  profiles during a 1-year treatment period
with 4-weekly  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg. the plot predicts a high degree of overlap between the panels. the
impact of sex on the serum profiles is minor, whereas bw
has a greater effect. the values of the weights chosen in
this simulation exercise correspond to the 2.5th, 50th, and
97.5th percentiles of the weight distribution in males and
females.
figure 5a shows the pharmacokinetic profiles for those
patients who were positive for anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies.
the profiles were superimposed on the 5th and 95th percentiles of the remaining patient population. the resulting
graphic confirms that the presence of anti- xxxd2443xxx  antibodies have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile.
race effects were not tested during the pharmacokinetic
model building process. however, an overlay of the 90 %

prediction interval of the pharmacokinetic timeline with the
concentrations observed in asian and black/african
american patients is shown in fig. 5b. most of the serum
 xxxd2443xxx  concentrations lay within the 90 % prediction
interval calculated using the serum pharmacokinetic profiles obtained in white patients. finally, fig. 6a, b shows
the median and 95 % prediction intervals of the serum
concentration profiles from 1000 simulated patients
(n = 500 females) after a single dose or assuming
4-weekly subcutaneous administration of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg.
3.5 pharmacokinetic descriptors
table 3 shows the summary statistics for the calculated
pharmacokinetic descriptors for the overall population
stratified by the corresponding categories in the two
selected covariates. with respect to bw, typical cmax and
aucs were decreased by 35 % in patients over 89 years of
age compared with patients younger than 62 years. cmax
and aucs were decreased by approximately 15 % in
females compared with males.

4 discussion
we have used a population pharmacokinetic model to
describe the serum concentration–time profiles of  xxxd2443xxx  following subcutaneous injection of  xxxd2443xxx 
autogelò in patients with functioning and non-functioning
nets. the selected model consists of an absorption process characterized by simultaneous first- and zero-order
rate input, and a one-compartment model to account for
disposition of the drug in the body. this type of absorption
model is commonly used when characterizing extendedrelease formulations [15, 16]. previously, in healthy volunteers, the first-order rate constant of absorption was
modeled to decrease exponentially as a function of the
natural logarithm of time, implying a faster value at early
times after dosing [3]. using time as a covariate affecting a
pharmacokinetic process has limitations, e.g., at the time to
simulate profiles after multiple dosing. in the current
analysis, we present a model in which time effects are
substituted by a more elaborate absorption model. the
faster initial absorption rate is now represented by the zeroorder process lasting 2.96 days.

patients positive for  xxxd2443xxx  antibodies (filled red circles) and
b corresponding to asian (n = 10) and black/african american
(n = 10) patients (filled black circles and filled orange circles,
respectively). the dashed blue lines show the 5th and 95th percentiles
of the observed  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations in the remaining patient
population

most of the (unknown) fraction of the absorbed dose
followed the first-order process (99.4 % in females, 97 %
in males), with a typical absorption half-life of 43.6 days.
such a long half-life implies flip-flop kinetics, but the
model-derived typical value for elimination half-life calvd =f
culated as 0:693  cl
was 0.59 h. this apparent dis=f

crepancy can be explained by the fact that the sampling
schedule adopted in study a allowed the capture of the
rapid decline in serum concentration (just after the zeroorder input process finished [typically 2.96 days after
administration]), as observed in several of the individual
profiles shown in electronic supplementary material figure s2. the decline of serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations was
also rapid following intravenous administration to healthy
volunteers (estimated elimination half-life 0.45 h) [3].
assuming that f is similar between healthy volunteers
and patients with functioning and non-functioning nets
(approximately 70 %) [3], the cl/f and vd/f are
359.1 l/day and 12.81 l for patients with nets, respectively. when compared with cl/f and vd/f estimates
reported for healthy volunteers (554 l/day and 15.1 l,
respectively) [3], it is evident that although the distribution
properties of  xxxd2443xxx  appear to be unaltered between
healthy volunteers and patients with functioning and nonfunctioning nets, elimination seems to be impaired in the
latter. it has to be taken into consideration that although in
the current analysis a one-compartment model was selected

to describe drug disposition, a three-compartment model is
closer to the true disposition characteristics, based on the
analysis performed in healthy volunteers with an extensive
sampling design. in the current scenario, more information
on the adme (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
excretion) properties would have been gained if rich sampling or single-dose studies data had been available at the
time of analysis. the 35 % decrease in cl/f in patients
with nets cannot be explained by differences in clcr.
half of the patient population in the current evaluation had
clcr values within the normal range, and clcr did not
show significant covariate effects. a nets-related
impaired active secretion process might explain the
reduced clearance; however, we are not aware of any literature data supporting that hypothesis.
interestingly, the variability in cl/f and in ka was
similar to that reported in healthy volunteers; on the other
hand, the variability obtained for vd/f was much greater
(150 vs. 23 %). the reason for this may be that in the
current model the three compartments (one central and two
peripheral) identified in the analysis of healthy volunteers
data were combined into a single one, and part of the
variability in the absorption process is reflected in vd/
f (note that variability in the duration of the zero-order
input process could not be estimated).
figure 6c shows serum  xxxd2443xxx  concentrations over
time at steady state. the plots were constructed by simulating 1000 profiles (500 males, 500 females, each group of
equivalent median weight) and summarizing the results as
the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles. simulations were
performed using the population estimates reported for
healthy volunteers [3] and those listed in table 2. the
spread of the data appears to be similar between the two
populations, but exposure is greater in patients due to the
lower rate of elimination. the concentration plateau seen in
the profiles representing patients with nets is due to the
zero-order absorption process lasting for 3 days.
none of the covariates tested showed statistically significant effects, with the exception of baseline bw which
influenced cl/f and the effects of gender on f1. the effect
of gender on f1 may be due to differences in the adipose
layer at the injection site of in female patients, in addition
to differences in perfusion at the subcutaneous level. it is
worth noting that gender effects were not identified in the
pharmacokinetic analysis performed in healthy volunteers.
gender effects on f1 should not be interpreted as differences in f between females and males: gender was found
to affect f1, providing estimates of f1 for males and
females of 0.97 and 0.994, respectively. bioavailability is
not modified by gender; differences are in the fractions of
the absorbed dose that use the first- or zero-order rate input
processes. our results indicate that in females the contribution of the zero-order process to drug input is lower than

(middle curves), and 97.5th (upper curves) percentiles from 1000
simulated patients (n = 500 females). the dosing schedule used in
the simulation exercise was  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg administered
subcutaneously every 4 weeks

in males, explaining the higher maximal predicted concentrations seen in males in the simulated profiles represented in fig. 4.
an increase in total drug clearance as the result of
increasing body weight is a common finding in pharmacokinetics. cl/f was found to increase by 30 % for a
weight of 104 kg (95th percentile) and to decrease by 23 %
for a weight of 51 kg (5th percentile) with respect to
median weight of 74 kg. as with the results of the effects
of body weight and gender on the pharmacokinetic

characteristics of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò, the values of auc
and serum concentrations appear to be slightly reduced in
the male population as compared with females (table 3).
however, this difference was not considered to be clinically relevant and no dose adjustment of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò based on weight is necessary since once the 95 %
confidence interval of the aucs values corresponding to
patients weighing between 62 and 89 kg (159–346 lgday/
l) was calculated, it was found that the percentages of
patients weighing\62 or[89 kg with aucs values greater

variables that are linked to hepatic function (bil, alb,
sgot, sgpt) were part of the covariate analysis and were
not found to be significant. however, calculation of the
child-pugh score was not possible and so we were not able
to predict the hepatic impairment status of the patients. for
this reason, patients with hepatic impairment were not
evaluated in this pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis. only two patients with severe renal impairment were
treated with  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò.

schedules such as  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò 120 mg every
2 weeks may be justified.
pharmacokinetic parameters for the whole gep-net
population could be described and no impact on the  xxxd2443xxx  pharmacokinetic profile could be identified in terms
of renal impairment clcr, bili, alb, sgpt, sgot,
location of primary tumor, age, presence of anti- xxxd2443xxx 
antibodies, and symptomatic/asymptomatic characteristics

5 conclusions
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò were assessed using a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data
from 290 patients with functioning/non-functioning gepnets pooled from four clinical trials.  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò
was administered as multiple deep subcutaneous injections
every 4 weeks at a dose of 120 mg in the majority of
patients.
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2443xxx  autogelò have been
described with a model containing two mechanisms of
absorption (first- and zero-order) and one compartment
model describing disposition of the drug in the body. the
vd/f was 18.3 l. the cl/f was 513 l/day for a 74 kg
patient, representing a substantial difference in clearance in
this population of patients with respect to healthy volunteers that could not be explained by any of the covariates
tested. the remaining ipv (not explained by covariates
effects) was 27 % for cl/f, 150 % for vd/f, 61 % for ka,
and 1 % for f1.
body weight had a moderate effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2443xxx .  xxxd2443xxx  cl/f was found
to increase by 30 % for a weight of 104 kg (95th percentile) and to decrease by 23 % for a weight of 51 kg (5th
percentile), suggesting that evaluation of additional dosing
