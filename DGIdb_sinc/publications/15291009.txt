the pharmacology and mechanisms of
action of new generation,
non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents

abstract

the new generation hypnotic drugs, zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon, are at least
as efficacious in the clinic as benzodiazepines and may offer advantages in terms of
safety. these drugs act through the bz binding sites associated with gabaa
receptors, but show some differences from benzodiazepines in pharmacological
effects and mechanisms of action. of particular interest is the finding that zolpidem
shows a wide separation between doses producing sedative effects and those giving
rise to other behavioural actions, and induces less tolerance and dependence than
benzodiazepines. zolpidem also demonstrates selectivity for gabaa receptors
containing æ1 subunits. recent studies using genetically modified mice have
confirmed that receptors containing  xxxg830xxx  subunits play a particularly important
role in mediating sedative activity, thus providing an explanation for the pharmacological profile of zolpidem.

1. introduction
when benzodiazepines were introduced, some
four decades ago, as a treatment for insomnia, they
represented a major advance in the therapy of this
disorder. benzodiazepines are effective hypnotic
agents and are much safer than drugs used
previously, such as barbiturates. however, benzodiazepines are not devoid of undesirable effects,
and chronic treatment can lead to tolerance and
dependence. considerable efforts have consequently been expended in the search for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs that have more
selective profiles and fewer side effects, while
acting through similar neural mechanisms to
benzodiazepines. three such drugs, zolpidem,
zopiclone and zaleplon, have been developed and
introduced into medical practice in recent years.

2. pharmacology of new generation
hypnotic drugs
it is interesting to note that the search for new
hypnotic drugs, which are as effective as benzodiazepines but with a better safety profile, was
focused on drugs that had similar mechanisms of
action to the benzodiazepines, showing affinity for
the so-called benzodiazepine or bz receptor. the
three new generation hypnotic drugs that have
reached the market so far, zolpidem, zopiclone and
zaleplon, all promote sleep by enhancing the
activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gaba,
at its receptors in the brain, but laboratory research
indicates clear differences in their pharmacological
[1–3]
their
profiles and mechanisms of action.
clinical profiles are also quite distinct.
zopiclone is a drug with a short or intermediate

sanger

[2]

duration of action, associated with its elimination
half-life. it is clearly an effective hypnotic drug; it
both induces and maintains sleep, increases sleep
duration, and appears to have reduced residual
effects. zolpidem has a shorter duration of action,
it also induces and maintains sleep, and many
clinical studies have shown that it has no residual
effects the day after it has been used. zaleplon is a
little different, as it is an ultra-short-acting compound with an extremely short duration of
[4]
action. for this reason, it is recommended for
sleep induction and not for sleep maintenance.
in rats, single doses of all three drugs significantly increased slow-wave sleep over a period of
at least 3 hours. however, major differences were
seen between zolpidem and zopiclone with respect
to their dose–response curves for hypnotic effects
relative to muscle-relaxant and anticonvulsant

effects in mice. with benzodiazepines, these
curves typically tend to be somewhat superimposed, as shown in figure 1, and with zopiclone the
picture is rather similar. in contrast, with zolpidem
the sedative effect occurs at much lower doses than
the other pharmacological effects, so that the
dose–response curve for sedation is displaced
relative to the other curves. similarly, in rats,
zolpidem shows a greater separation between
sedative and muscle-relaxant doses than zaleplon,
[5]
whereas zolpiclone shows no separation.
these results are interesting in two respects.
first, they show that zolpidem has a preferential
sedative or hypnotic effect. second, and just as
importantly, they indicate that the traditional
explanation for the relative displacement of the
dose–response curves for different phamacological
effects with benzodiazepines, namely that these

effects occur at different levels of receptor occupation, cannot be correct. in terms of this hypothesis,
it would not be possible for any molecule to
produce the type of pattern seen with zolpidem. so
another hypothesis had to be sought.
another important aspect of the pharmacology
of all hypnotic drugs is, of course, what happens
with repeated administration. there is much
concern with benzodiazepines that repeated administration may give rise to pharmacological
tolerance, in other words, the pharmacological
effects seen at the beginning of the administration
of the drug may wear off. at certain dose levels,
physiological dependence, indicated by a withdrawal syndrome on treatment discontinuation,
may also occur. this has been demonstrated in
the clinic and in the laboratory. published data
indicate that zolpidem (figure 2), zopiclone and
zaleplon all induce less pharmacological tolerance
[6]
than benzodiazepines in experimental animals.
results showing less physical dependence and
fewer withdrawal symptoms with zolpidem (figure
3) and zopiclone in experimental animals, relative
[7,8]
to benzodiazepines, have also been published.

3. mechanism of action of new
generation hypnotic drugs
all the new generation hypnotic drugs act at the
so-called benzodiazepine receptor, also known as
the bz receptor or the omega receptor. this site of
action is associated with the gabaa subtype of
gaba receptors in the cns. gaba is the main
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian
cns, and in addition to the binding site for gaba
itself, the gabaa receptor includes binding sites
for several other types of compound, including the
barbiturates and the benzodiazepines as well as the
new generation hypnotic drugs. however, in vitro
receptor binding experiments using tissue taken
from different areas of the rat cns gave very
[9]
different results for the three drugs. zolpidem
showed an approximately ninefold greater affinity
for receptors in the cerebellum ( xxxd367xxx  receptors)
than for receptors in the spinal cord (bz2 receptors). there was a somewhat lesser difference in
affinity with zaleplon, but no significant difference
with zopiclone, which in this respect resembles
benzodiazepines. the results of in vivo experib

ments were similar. in such studies, rats were
treated with a radioactive bz receptor ligand,
flumazenil, and then with zolpidem, zopiclone or
zaleplon. comparison of the displacement curves
plotted for different brain areas revealed the
receptor selectivity of each drug. with zopiclone,
all the curves were superimposed, indicating the
same degree of displacement in all brain areas.
with zaleplon, there was a slight separation of the
curves relative to one another. by far the greatest
separation was seen with zolpidem, again demon[9]
strating its selectivity for  xxxd367xxx  receptors.
recent work in molecular pharmacology has
provided an explanation of what these pharmacological data actually mean both in structural and in
functional terms. gabaa receptors have a pentameric form, comprising five protein subunits
surrounding the ion channel. these protein subunits include a variety of subtypes, known as æ, ,
ª, etc., and each of these has different isoforms, so
there are æ1 , æ2 , æ3 , etc. subunits, for example.
what this signifies is that gabaa receptors in the
cns can in principle comprise a very wide variety
of different structures. it is also known now that the

subtypes of bz receptors defined pharmacologically as  xxxd367xxx  and bz2 correspond to gabaa
receptors with different structures.  xxxd367xxx  receptors
correspond to gabaa receptors containing æ1
subunits, whereas the bz2 receptors form a more
heterogeneous category, because they seem to
correspond to gabaa receptors containing either
[10,11]
æ2 or æ3 or æ5 subunits.
the value of this type of knowledge is that the
subtypes of gabaa receptors can be used to study
the mechanism of action of hypnotic and other
drugs in much more detail in biochemical or
electrophysiological experiments. it is impossible
to produce preparations with pure receptors containing particular subunits using native tissue taken
from experimental animals, but this is quite
feasible using molecular biology techniques. in
practice, genetic material is introduced into cells
that do not normally express gabaa receptors at
all, in order to force these tissues to express
particular protein subunits and therefore create
gabaa receptors with different structures. these
cells can then be used for receptor binding or
electrophysiological experiments. table i shows

data from graham[16]

the results of receptor binding experiments using
recombinant gabaa receptors made up of different combinations of æ,  and ª subunits. with
zopiclone, as with the two benzodiazepines tested,
the receptor affinity measured by ligand displacement is similar whatever the structure of the
gabaa receptors, in other words, there is practically no receptor selectivity. zolpidem, in contrast,
has a high affinity for gabaa receptors containing the æ1 subunit, 10 times less affinity for
receptors containing an æ2 subunit combined with
1 and ª2 subunits, and in the case of receptors
containing the æ5 subunit, no biologically signifi[1]
cant affinity. similar receptor binding experiments comparing zolpidem, zopiclone and
zaleplon indicated that zaleplon also has a higher
affinity for certain gabaa receptor subtypes, but
its selectivity was less than that of zolpidem.
these results lead to the hypothesis that the
hypnotic effects of all drugs binding to bz
receptors, including both benzodiazepines and
new generation hypnotic drugs, are mediated via
activity at gabaa receptors containing the æ1
subunit in the cns. until recently, it was only
possible to study this hypothesis using the technique described above and with electrophysiologi[5]
however, it has now become
cal methods.
possible to investigate this more directly, using
genetically modified mice. at least two laboratories have succeeded in creating mutant mice,

known as knock-in mice, by introducing a mutation
in their genome such that their gabaa receptors,
containing specific subunits, such as the æ1 æ2 or
æ3 subunit, are no longer sensitive to drugs acting
at the bz site. by studying the pharmacology of
these drugs in such knock-in mice, it is possible to
check which effects are maintained and which
effects are lost, and therefore to test hypotheses
[12]
such as that described above. the results of one
such experiment are illustrated in figure 4.
this experiment measured the effects of diazepam on two parameters, muscle relaxation (horizontal wire test) and sedation (motor activity), in
control, wild-type mice and in mutant mice in
which gabaa receptors containing æ1 subunits
were no longer sensitive to bz receptor ligands but
all other gabaa receptor subtypes were unchanged. with regard to muscle relaxation, the
effect of diazepam was the same in both wild-type
and mutant mice. in contrast, although diazepam
showed its typical sedative effect in wild-type
mice, this effect was completely lost in the
[12]
this is a very good
genetically modified mice.
test of the hypothesis that the sedative or hypnotic
effect of both benzodiazepines and the new
generation drugs are mediated through gabaa
receptors containing the æ1 subunit. in contrast,
other effects associated with certain hypnotic
drugs, such as muscle relaxation, are probably
not mediated via gabaa receptors containing the
æ1 subunit. furthermore, there is now some
evidence to indicate that the anxiolytic effects of
bz receptor ligands are mediated via gabaa
receptors containing the æ2 subunit, based on the
results of experiments with similar results to those
[13]
similar experiments with
described above.
zolpidem also showed that the sedative effects are
mediated through gabaa receptors containing the
[14]
æ1 subunit.
4. conclusions
on the basis of the ingenious and sophisticated
experiments described above, it can now be stated
with a fair amount of certainty that the sedative
effects of all drugs acting at the so-called bz

receptors are mediated via activity at gabaa
receptors containing the æ1 subunit. with regard to
the different new generation drugs, the following
conclusions can be drawn. zaleplon has a benzodiazepine-like profile in experimental animals,
although it appears to have a reduced propensity
to induce tolerance relative to benzodiazepines,
and it shows some selectivity for  xxxd367xxx  receptors, i.e.
gabaa receptors with æ1 subunits. zopiclone also
has a benzodiazepine-like pharmacological profile,
and shows no selectivity for different subtypes of
bz receptors or gabaa receptors, although its
mechanism of action may not be identical to that of
[15]
finally, zolpidem is
the benzodiazepines.
clearly a  xxxd367xxx  -selective compound, in other words,
a compound showing a degree of selectivity for
gabaa receptors containing æ1 subunits. in
comparison with both benzodiazepines and the
other new generation hypnotic drugs currently
available, zolpidem acts more selectively on the
receptors mediating the hypnotic effects of all
these drugs.
