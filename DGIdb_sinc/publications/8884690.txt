abstract
the nodose ganglion contains the cell bodies of afferent nerves which convey predominantly sensory information from the viscera to
the central nervous system (cns). autoradiographic studies show binding sites for [3-adrenoceptor ligands are present on sections of the
rat nodose ganglion and also on the corresponding inferior vagal ganglion in humans, indicating the presence of [3-adrenoceptors in these
ganglia. since prolonged stimulation of [3-adrenoceptors in rats with the nonselective [3-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2398xxx  (400
p.g kg i day i s.c.) for 14 days results in desensitisation and/or down-regulation of receptors in peripheral tissues, such as heart, kidney
and blood vessels, the effects of this treatment on the ]3-adrenoceptor population on the nodose ganglion have been examined. using
[t25i]- xxxd2957xxx  as a radioligand, autoradiographic studies revealed that specific binding was reduced by 74% in ganglia from
 xxxd2398xxx -pretreated rats compared to that in ganglia from vehicle-pretreated rats, demonstrating down-regulation of receptors by
 xxxd2398xxx . [ j251]- xxxd2957xxx  binding was sensitive to inhibition by ici 118,551 (selective [32-adrenoceptor antagonist) but not to atenolol
(selective [3~-adrenoceptor antagonist), indicating receptors are predominantly of the 132-adrenoceptor subtype. no change in binding was
apparent over the vagus nerve. the nodose ganglion appears to be an additional site at which [32-adrenoceptors may be down-regulated in
vivo, possibly interfering with normal baro-, chemo- and sensory reflexes.

1. introduction
prolonged agonist stimulation of 13-adrenoceptors results in their desensitisation or down-regulation. the extent
of the reduced receptor response which is often, but not
always, accompanied by a reduction in receptor number
[22] varies between agonists, duration of exposure, target
tissue and receptor subtype.
for example, chronic infusion of  xxxd2398xxx , a nonselective [3-adrenoceptor agonist into guinea-pigs results in a
marked loss of [32-adrenoceptors from cardiac conducting
tissue, surrounding myocardium and aortic smooth muscle.
the effects on [3~-adrenoceptors are less pronounced; receptor density is reduced in the conducting regions but is
unchanged over the myocardium [16,22]. this preferential
loss of i32-adrenoceptors compared to 13~-adrenoceptors in
the heart has also been demonstrated using ventricular
membrane preparations from  xxxd2398xxx -pretreated rats

[i 1,19,23]. chronic treatment of rats with  xxxd2957xxx  or
 xxxd458xxx  ([3-adrenoceptor antagonists with partial agonist
activity) results in a reduced density of [32-adrenoceptors
in ventricular membrane preparations while the [31-adrenoceptor density is increased [19].
direct infusion of  xxxd2398xxx  into the right lateral
ventricle of rat brain produces a decrease in [32-adrenoce ptor density in many but not all subcortical areas and
cerebellum, while 131-adrenoceptor density is relatively
unchanged [21]. infusion of noradrenaline (s.c. for 14
days) reduces [3j-adrenoceptors in renal cortical membranes to a greater extent than 132-adrenoceptors, while the
reverse is true for adrenaline pretreatment;  xxxd2398xxx 
pretreatment reduces both receptor subtypes to a similar
extent [25]. in peripheral blood vessels such as the rat
pulmonary artery [14], 13~-adrenoceptors are reported to be
more susceptible than [32-adrenoceptors to desensitisation
a n d / o r down-regulation in response to chronic  xxxd2398xxx  administration.

exposure involves uncoupling of the receptor from its
second messenger system (desensitisation) [26] and internalisation (downregulation) [27]. differences in response
to  xxxd2398xxx , which has a similar potency at both 13adrenoceptor subtypes [15] may be related to the degree of
receptor occupation by locally released agonist which may
in turn affect the relative turnover rates of receptors in the
cell membrane [18,20]. alternatively, the number of phosphorylation sites on the receptors may make one subtype
more or less susceptible to desenitisation and/or downregulation [9].
previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated 132adrenoceptor binding sites on the rat nodose ganglion and
human inferior vagal ganglion [12]. these ganglia contain
the cell bodies of afferent nerves which relay peripheral
baro-, chemo- and sensory information to the central nervous system (cns). as such, they represent a target at
which peripherally acting drugs may modulate centrally
mediated reflexes. the aim of the present study was to
observe if changes in the 13-adrenoceptor population on the
rat nodose ganglion occurred after chronic exposure to the
nonselective 13-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd2398xxx , using autoradiographic techniques with the radioligand [125i] xxxd2957xxx .

2. methods

2.1. lsoprenaline pretreatment
surgery and experiments were preformed in accordance
with the prevention of cruelty to animals act 1986, under
the guidelines of the code of practice for the care and use
of animals for experimental purposes in australia. ten
sprague-dawley rats (male, 250-350 g) were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (30 mg kg -1 , i.p.) and
 xxxd2482xxx  (20 mgkg -l, s.c.), and mini-pumps (alzet,
model 2002) implanted as previously described [16]. rats
received 400 ixg (-)- xxxd2398xxx -hc1 kg- 1 hr- 1 or an
equivalent dose of vehicle (1 mm hci) for 2 weeks. rats
were then anaesthetized with co 2 (20%/80% 0 2) and
bled. both nodose ganglia were removed, embedded in
tissue tek (oct, miles diagnostics), frozen in liquid
nitrogen-cooled isopentane and stored at -80°c. (-)- xxxd2398xxx  was purchased from sigma, usa.

2.2. autoradiography
frozen sections (6 ixm) were cut, thaw-mounted onto
gelatin/chrome alum-coated glass microscope slides and
stored at -24°c. s(-)- xxxd2957xxx  (research biochemicals,
usa) was radioiodinated with na125i (2000 cimmo1-1)
using the chloramine t method and purified using paper
chromatography as previously described [1]. the specificity of this ligand for 13-adrenoceptors has been previously characterised [2]. preliminary experiments using

13

slide-mounted sections found specific binding was optimal
at 40 min incubation at room temperature (21-23°c).
before incubation, slides were washed at room temperature
(2 × 5 min) in 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  containing 10 mm
mgci 2 (ph 7.5) to remove endogenous ligands. slides
were then incubated in the above buffer containing 240
pm [125i]- xxxd2957xxx  for 40 min at room temperature. nonspecific binding was determined by co-incubation with 10
i~m propranolol. atenolol (10 txm) and ici 118,551 (3
nm) were used to distinguish binding to 13v and 132-adrenoceptor subtypes respectively. after incubation, slides were
washed in buffer (5 min, room temperature), rinsed in
distilled water and dried in a stream of warm air. to
preserve histology, tissue was fixed in paraformaldehyde
vapour (45 min, 60°c). the bound radioligand was detected by apposing slides along with [125i]-microscales
(amersham), to x-ray film (kodak xar-5). ici 118,551,
atenolol and propranolol were gifts from imperial chemical industries, uk.

2.3. data analysis
quantification of [~25i]- xxxd2957xxx  binding to ganglia and
vagus nerve was achieved using an mcid m4 image
analyser (imaging research, canada). under constant illumination, optical density readings were obtained for x-ray
film images for the microscales and a standard third degree
polynomial curve of relative optical density (rod) versus
dpm mm-2 generated. measurements of the ganglia were
taken from between the site of entry of the superior
laryngeal nerve (seen in fig. 1a) and the connection of the
inferior pharyngeal nerve, they fell within the standard
curve range, and were tabulated as dpm mm-2. students
t-test was used to compare binding over tissue from vehicle- and  xxxd2398xxx -pretreated rats (unpaired variables),
and also the effect of drugs on binding (paired variables).

3. results

[tzsi]- xxxd2957xxx  bound to sections of nodose ganglia and
was displaced almost totally by 10 i~m propranolol (fig. 1
a, b). binding was differentially localised over the body
of the ganglia with greater binding seen over the nerve
fibres compared to the cell bodies. nerve fibres in the
associated vagus and superior laryngeal nerves were also
densely labelled (fig. 1 a). sections of ganglia from rats
pretreated with  xxxd2398xxx  showed a visible loss of
[125i]- xxxd2957xxx  binding from both fibres and cell bodies of
the ganglia, but not from the associated vagus nerve (fig.
1 c,d).
x-ray film images of the ganglia were measured separate from the vagus nerve by densitometry (table 1). in
vehicle-pretreated rats, specific binding (defined using the
nonselective antagonist propranolol 10 ~m) was found to
be 84 + 2% (values taken from 3-6 sections (1-3 slides)

found to be 51 + 8% (values taken from 3-6 sections of

4. discussion

4.1. [32-adrenoceptors in nodose ganglia

fig. 1. binding of [ 125i]- xxxd2957xxx  to sections of nodose ganglia taken from
a vehicle- (a, b) and an  xxxd2398xxx -pretreated rat (c), demonstrated
using x-ray film as a photographic negative. total binding (a, c):
nonspecific binding (b) defined by 10 ~zm propranolol; histology of
ganglia shown in d. differential binding is seen over the cell bodies (cb)
and nerve fibres (nf). note decrease in total binding over ganglia (g) but
not over the vagus nerve (v) after chronic  xxxd2398xxx  infusion, sin =
superior laryngeal nerve. stain = thionin; scale bar = 600 ~m.

the current study has demonstrated specific [125i] xxxd2957xxx  binding to [32-adrenoceptors (ici l18,551-sensitive) in the nodose ganglion and vagus nerve of the rat.
these receptors may be synthesized in the ganglion and
then transported to central nerve terminals or to the periphery via the vagus nerve [12]. this is consistent with the
observation that noradrenaline directly stimulates baroreceptor nerve endings, modulating their sensitivity to mechanical stimulation [17,29].
pretreatment of rats with  xxxd2398xxx  (400
ixgkg ~hr-~ for 2 weeks) resulted in a 74% loss of
specific [~25i]- xxxd2957xxx  binding from [32-adrenoceptors over
the nodose ganglion. this reduction was primarily due to a
60% loss of total binding, exacerbated by a significant
increase in nonspecific binding.
the decrease in [~25i]- xxxd2957xxx  binding may be due to a
decrease in the number of viable receptors a n d / o r a
decrease in affinity of the 132-adrenoceptors for the ligand.
previous quantitative studies using iodinated  xxxd2957xxx  to
measure changes in [3-adrenoceptors in  xxxd2398xxx -pretreated tissues have shown receptor density is reduced,
while affinity is unchanged [21,23]. while [3-adrenoceptor
affinity can decrease without a change in receptor number
[21,22], it is more likely that the loss of binding observed
in this study is due to a reduced number of viable receptors.

4.2. vagus nerve
due to its hydrophilic nature,  xxxd2398xxx  cannot access the cns. consequently, chronic pretreatment of animals results in desensitisation or down-regulation of peripheral adrenoceptors only. no change of [125i]- xxxd2957xxx 
binding was apparent over the vagus nerve. this would
indicate that binding was associated with parasympathetic
efferent fibres whose cell bodies are located centrally in
the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus ambiguus in the brainstem [30] and as such are inaccessible to
circulating  xxxd2398xxx . alternatively, binding may be over
afferent fibres and was unaffected by circulating  xxxd2398xxx  due to the relative rates of synthesis or uncoupling
of receptors [20] and/or amount of local agonist present
[18].

4.3. desensitisation \ downregulation of  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors
13-adrenoceptors appear to be dynamic; residing in an
active state on the cell surface where they can activate
adenylate cyclase, and also within intracellular compartments, unable to bind effector molecules [24]. prolonged
exposure of 13-adrenoceptors to a 13-agonist results in
desensitisation i.e., an altered cellular response due to
uncoupling of the receptor from its second messenger
system [26]. the process is thought to involve phosphorylation of the receptor by two enzymes; [3-adrenergic receptor kinase (13-ark) [3] or camp-dependant protein kinase
(ca.pk) [4]. a third enzyme, 13-arrestin is involved with
uncoupling the receptor from the g protein [ 13]. internalisation of the uncoupled but intact receptor [27] results in
down-regulation, i.e., a decrease in the number of receptors on the cell surface [26]. receptors may later be
recycled to the cell surface upon removal of the agonist
stimulus [24]. several studies have retrieved internalised
receptors in a light vesicle fraction from normal and
desensitised tissue [24,26]. prolonged exposure of tissues
to  xxxd2398xxx  may also reduce the level and expression of
13-adrenoceptor mrna, maintaining the reduction in cell
surface receptors [8].

4.4. chronic catecholamine exposure
results of this study are in agreement with previous
work showing a decrease in 13-adrenoceptors after chronic
 xxxd2398xxx -pretreatment. in particular, our results correlate with the loss of 132- (more so than 131) adrenoceptors
from neural tissue in cardiac conducting regions of the rat
[10] and guinea-pig heart [16,22] and cns [21].
clinically, high levels of circulating catecholamines are
found in human plasma following acute myocardial infarction [6] and in congestive heart failure [7]. in the failing
human heart, 13-adrenoceptors undergo in vivo desensitisation; contractile responses to 13-adrenoceptor agonists in

15

vitro are decreased and binding studies show a reduction in
13-adrenoceptor density [5,18].
the exact mechanism of what may be a cardioprotectire response [28] is not understood. while the level of
circulating catecholamines is increased, local myocardial
catecholamine stores may be depleted [18].

4.5. role of sympathetic innervation
the high level of noradrenaline seen in heart failure is
thought to arise from altered patterns of sympathetic innervation or stimulation of sympathetic reflexes [7,18]. the
nodose ganglion contains the cell bodies of sensory nerves
that form the afferent arm of the baro- and other peripheral
reflexes and thus is probably involved in initiating changes
in catecholamine levels seen in heart failure and hypertension. antagonists to 13-adrenoceptors (b-blockers) are
widely used to treat hypertension despite a persistent lack
of understanding into their exact mechanism of action.
13-adrenoceptors synthesised in the nodose ganglion and
transported centrally may regulate release of neurotransmitters, possibly glutamate from afferent nerves [ 12]. these
receptors appear to be subject to in vivo down-regulation,
possibly interfering with normal baro-, chemo- and sensory
reflexes. extending this further, the nodose ganglion is a
possible target for peripherally acting drugs to modulate
sympathetic output by centrally controlled mechanisms.
