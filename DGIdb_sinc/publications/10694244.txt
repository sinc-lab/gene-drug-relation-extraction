1 the eect of troglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug with insulin-sensitizing action, on antigeninduced production of leukotriene (lt) b4, c4 and e4 and  xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx ) was examined
in dinitrophenol (dnp)-speci®c immunoglobulin e (ige)-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  mast cells following
stimulation by the antigen, dnp-conjugated human  xxxg124xxx . levels of ltb4, c4 and e4 and
 xxxg1073xxx  in the conditioned medium were enzyme-immunoassayed.
2 troglitazone inhibited the antigen-induced production of ltb4, c4 and e4 and the potency of
the inhibition was comparable to that of  xxxd3554xxx , a speci®c inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) and
a clinically used anti-asthmatic drug. neither troglitazone nor  xxxd3554xxx  aected antigen-induced
production of  xxxg1073xxx ,  xxxd208xxx  release from membrane phospholipids and degranulation.
3 troglitazone inhibited ltb4 production by the supernatant fraction of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cell lysate with
similar potency to  xxxd3554xxx , suggesting that troglitazone inhibits lt production by direct inhibition
of  xxxg147xxx  activity.
4 furthermore, it was shown that troglitazone as well as  xxxd3554xxx  inhibited ltb4 production in
a23187-stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils.
5 these ®ndings suggest that troglitazone inhibits antigen-induced lt production in the igesensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells and a23187-stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils by direct inhibition of 5lox activity.

introduction
troglitazone
((+)-5-[4-(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-ylmethoxy)benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione) is an antidiabetic reagent which is capable of improving insulin
resistance in diabetic patients (suter et al., 1992; nolan et al.,
1994). the chemical structure of troglitazone is composed of
two components, a thiazolidinedione ring and a chroman ring.
thiazolidinediones that contain the thiazolidine ring have
recently been demonstrated to be ligands of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)-g, one of the isoforms
of a group of transcription factors that regulates gene
expression of enzymes associated with lipid homeostasis
(lehmann et al., 1995; willson et al., 1996). ppar-g ligands
have recently been demonstrated to inhibit production of
in¯ammatory cytokines in human monocytes (jiang et al.,
1998) and activation of mouse macrophages (ricote et al.,
1998). on the other hand, a chroman ring is a component of
 xxxd3521xxx  that shows anti-oxidant activity.  xxxd3521xxx  also
inhibits  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) activity, with the ic50 of 5 mm
(reddanna et al., 1985).

leukotriene (lt) c4 and prostaglandin (pg) d2 by antigen
stimulation after sensitization with immunoglobulin e (ige)
(lin et al., 1991; westcott et al., 1996; hamasaki et al., 1999).
using ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells, the eect of troglitazone
on antigen-induced production of ltb4, c4 and e4 and  xxxg1073xxx 
were examined and compared with those of  xxxd3554xxx , an
inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx  and clinically used for the treatment of
asthma (dahlen et al., 1998). the eects of troglitazone and
 xxxd3554xxx  on antigen-induced production of  xxxg1073xxx  and
degranulation in ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells were also
examined. furthermore, to analyse the mechanism of action
of troglitazone, the eect of troglitazone on ltb4 production
in a cell-free system of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells and on a23187-induced
ltb4 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils were also
examined.

methods
rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cell culture and treatment with drugs
rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells (american type culture collection, manassas,
va, u.s.a.) were suspended at a concentration of 56105 cells
ml71 in eagle's minimum essential medium (emem, nissui

seiyaku, tokyo, japan) containing 10% (v v71) foetal bovine
serum (fbs, dainippon pharmaceutical co., osaka, japan),
 xxxd2871xxx  (18 mg ml71), streptomycin sulfate
(50 mg ml71) (meiji seika, tokyo, japan) and 0.1% (v v71)
conditioned medium of dinitrophenol (dnp)-speci®c igeproducing hybridoma (kindly supplied from dr kazutaka
maeyama at ehime university, ehime, japan) and 1.0 ml of
the cell suspension was poured into each well of a 12-well
cluster dish (costar, cambridge, ma, u.s.a.).
to examine the eects of drugs, the cells were preincubated
with troglitazone (sankyo co., tokyo, japan) or  xxxd3554xxx 
(kindly supplied from abbott laboratories, abbott park, il,
u.s.a.) for 2 h before the antigen challenge. the cells were then
washed and incubated for the periods indicated in piperazinen,n'-bis(2-ethanesulphonic acid) (pipes) buer (in mm:
pipes 6.25, nacl 30, kcl 1.25, glucose 5.6, mgcl2 1.4, naoh
40, and 0.5 g ml71 bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa), ph 7.2)
containing dnp-conjugated human  xxxg124xxx  (dnphsa, sigma chemical co., st. louis, mi, u.s.a.) (hirasawa et
al., 1995) and with or without various concentrations of
troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx . drugs were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide and added to the medium. final concentration of the
vehicle was adjusted to 0.001% (v v71).
after treatment with drugs, the viability of the cells were
examined by the ability of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase to cleave 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide to the blue compound formazan
(kobayashi et al., 1994); no cytotoxic eect was observed
(data not shown).

determination of levels of ltb4, c4 and e4 and  xxxg1073xxx  in
the conditioned medium
after incubation, the conditioned medium was collected,
centrifuged at 15006g and 48c for 5 min, and the supernatant
was used for the determination of ltb4, c4 and e4 and  xxxg1073xxx .
levels of ltb4, c4 and e4 and  xxxg1073xxx  in the conditioned
medium were determined using each enzyme-immunoassay
(eia) kit (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi, u.s.a.)
(pradelles et al., 1990). accuracy tests and linearity tests using
each eia kit revealed that levels of each  xxxd208xxx 
metabolite in the conditioned medium could be determined
without prior extraction and puri®cation. the assay limit for
each  xxxd208xxx  metabolite is as follows; 5.5 pg ml71 for
ltb4, 8.0 pg ml71 for ltc4, 5.6 pg ml71 for lte4, and
7.0 pg ml71 for  xxxg1073xxx . the cross-reactivity of each antibody to
other  xxxd208xxx  metabolites was less than 0.001%.
troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx  at the concentrations examined in
the experiments did not aect the determination of levels of
each  xxxd208xxx  metabolite.

determination of the release of radioactivity from
[3h]- xxxd208xxx -labelled rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells (2.56105 cells) were incubated for 18 h at 378c
in 0.5 ml medium containing dnp-speci®c ige and [3h]arachidonic
acid
(2.7 kbq,
speci®c
radioactivity
2.5 tbq mmol71, nen life science products, boston, ma,
u.s.a.). then, 50 ml of medium containing drugs was added to
each well, and further incubated for 2 h at 378c. cells were
then washed and incubated for 15 min at 378c in 0.5 ml of
pipes buer containing dnp-hsa (50 ng ml71) and the
corresponding concentrations of drugs. before the antigen
challenge, the cells in each well of one group were lysed with
0.5 ml of 0.1% (v v71) solution of triton x-100 in emem and
total radioactivity incorporated in the cells was determined.
british journal of pharmacology, vol 129 (2)

inhibition of lt production by troglitazone

released radioactivity in the conditioned medium was
determined and expressed as per cent of total radioactivity
incorporated in the cells.

determination of the degranulation of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
degranulation of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells was determined as hexosaminidase release into the conditioned medium (hirasawa et al.,
1995). ten microliters of 1 mm of p-nitrophenyl n-acetyl b-dglucosamide (sigma chemical co.) solution in 0.1 m citrate
buer (0.1 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m  xxxd1710xxx , ph 4.5) was
added to 10 ml of the conditioned medium and incubated at
378c for 1 h. then, 250 ml of 0.1 m  xxxd3212xxx  buer
(0.1 m nahco3, 0.1 m na2co3, ph 10.0) was added to stop
the reaction and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured.
before the antigen challenge, the cells in each well of one group
were lysed with 1.0 ml of 0.1% (v v71) solution of triton x100 in water, and total amount of hexosaminidase in the cells
before the antigen challenge was determined. degranulation of
the cells was expressed as follows; degranulation (%)=(total
amount of hexosaminidase in the conditioned medium after
the antigen challenge)6(total amount of hexosaminidase in
the cells before the antigen challenge)716100.

determination of ltb4 production by 20,0006g
supernatant of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells (2.56107 cells) were harvested by trypsinization, suspended in 500 ml of buer i (in mm: bes 10, pipes 10
and edta 1, ph 6.8) and lysed by sonication (carter et al.,
1991). the lysate was centrifuged at 20,0006g and 48c for
20 min. a 12.5 ml aliquot of the supernatant fraction (6.9 mg
protein) was preincubated for 2 h at 378c with 12.5 ml of
buer i containing troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx . then, 50 ml of
assay buer (in mm: bes 10, pipes 10, edta 1, cacl2 0.7,
and nacl 100, ph 6.8) containing troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx  was
added and reactions were initiated by addition of 3 ml of
aqueous nh4oh (0.028%, v v71) containing 1 mmol of
 xxxd208xxx  (sigma chemical co.). reactions were
terminated after 30 min by acidi®cation with hcl to ph 3.5.
pge2 (sigma chemical co.) (40 pg in 100 ml) was added for
the correction of recovery. the supernatant was mixed with
675 ml of water-glacial acetic acid (98.3 : 1.7, v v71) and applied
on a sep-pak c18 cartridge (waters, milford, ma, u.s.a.).
the columns were then sequentially washed with 5 ml each of
the following mixtures of methanol:water:glacial acetic acid
(33 : 66 : 1, 70 : 30 : 0.1, and 100 : 0 : 0, v v71) and the eluant of
70% methanol was collected into the siliconized glass tube.
the eluant was evaporated under the vacuum condition,
reconstituted in 1.25 ml of pipes buer, and concentrations
of ltb4 were determined using eia kit (cayman chemical).
the recovery during the extraction procedure was corrected by
the amount of pge2 in the ®nal fraction determined by
radioimmunoassay (ohuchi et al., 1985).

polymorphonuclear leucocyte culture and treatment with
drugs
male sprague-dawley strain rats, speci®c pathogen-free
(charles river japan, kanagawa, japan), were used. the rats
were treated in accordance with procedures approved by the
animal ethics committee of the graduate school of
pharmaceutical sciences, tohoku university, sendai, japan.
rat peritoneal neutrophils were harvested 16 h after intraperitoneal injection of 40 ml of ca2+-free krebs-ringer solution
containing 1% (w v71) casein (casein from milk, vitamin-free,

wako pure chemicals, osaka, japan) which had been
sterilized by autoclaving at 1218c for 15 min (edamatsu et
al., 1997). the peritoneal cells were washed twice with ca2+free phosphate-buered saline (pbs, ph 7.4) and ®nally
suspended in rpmi 1640 medium (nissui seiyaku) containing
0.25% (w v71) bsa (sigma chemical co.) at 56105 cells ml71.
the purity of neutrophils was more than 97% as assessed by
may-gruènwald-giemsa staining.
rat peritoneal neutrophils (16106 cells) were preincubated
for 2 h at 378c in 2 ml of emem containing 10% (v v71) fbs
and various concentrations of troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx  (®nal
concentrations of each drug were 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mm). after
three washes, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 378c in
2 ml of pipes buer containing a23187 (1 mm) and the
corresponding concentrations of troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx .
concentrations of ltb4 in the conditioned medium were
determined using eia kit (cayman chemical).
after treatment with drugs, the viability of the cells were
examined (kobayashi et al., 1994); no cytotoxic eect was
observed (data not shown).

statistical analysis
results were analysed for statistical signi®cance by one-way
anova followed by dunnett's test for multiple comparisons
and student's t-test for unpaired observations.

results
stimulation by the antigen of eicosanoid production in
rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
the ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells were incubated at 378c for
15 min in the presence of the various concentrations of the
antigen dnp-hsa, and levels of ltb4, c4 and e4 and  xxxg1073xxx 
in the conditioned medium were determined. without antigen
stimulation, cells did not produce detectable amount of each
eicosanoid (figure 1a). when the cells were incubated in
medium containing the antigen at concentrations of
50 ng ml71 or greater, levels of each eicosanoid in the
conditioned medium at 15 min were increased. the eect
reached a maximum at a concentration of 100 ng ml71 (figure
1a). in subsequent experiments, cells were stimulated with
dnp-hsa at a concentration of 50 ng ml71. the nonsentizied rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells with ige did not produce detectable
amount of each eicosanoid by the antigen (50 ± 200 ng ml71) at
30 min (data not shown).

time course of the antigen-induced eicosanoid production
in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
when the ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells were incubated in
medium containing 50 ng ml71 of dnp-hsa, levels of ltb4
and c4 in the conditioned medium were increased timedependently until 30 min after the antigen challenge, and
decreased thereafter (figure 1b). in contrast, levels of lte4
and  xxxg1073xxx  were increased until 60 min (figure 1b). in
subsequent experiments, levels of each eicosanoid were
determined 30 min after antigen challenge.

eects of preincubation time with troglitazone on the
antigen-induced production of ltc4 in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
the ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells were preincubated at 378c
for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min in the presence of 1 mm

detectable amount.

troglitazone, washed and incubated at 378c for 30 min in
the presence of the antigen dnp-hsa (50 ng ml71) and
1 mm of troglitazone. as shown in figure 2, ltc4
production was signi®cantly inhibited following 15 min
preincubation, and the inhibitory eect of troglitazone was
increased time-dependently till 2 h, at which time maximum
inhibition was noted (figure 2). therefore, in the following
experiments, ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells were preincubated for 2 h in the presence of drugs, washed, and
incubated for 30 min in medium containing the antigen
dnp-hsa (50 ng ml71) and corresponding concentrations
of drugs.
as shown in table 1, troglitazone inhibited the antigeninduced production of ltb4, c4 and e4 in a concentrationdependent manner.  xxxd3554xxx , a  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor, also inhibited
the antigen-induced production of ltb4, c4 and e4 concentration-dependently (table 1). ic50 values of troglitazone for the

0.35+0.09 and 0.34+0.05 mm, respectively (means+s.e.mean
from four independent determinations).
both troglitazone and  xxxd3554xxx  did not inhibit antigeninduced  xxxg1073xxx  production (table 1).

eects of troglitazone on the antigen-induced
 xxxd208xxx  release in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
the release of radioactivity from [3h]-arachidonic acidlabelled rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells at 15 min was signi®cantly increased
by the antigen challenge (table 2). treatment with
troglitazone at 1 mm did not aect the antigen-induced
release of radioactivity (table 2).  xxxd3554xxx  at 1 mm also did
not aect antigen-induced release of radioactivity (table 2).
the release of radioactivity from non-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx 
cells with ige was not increased signi®cantly by the antigen
(50 ng ml71) at 15 min (1.63+0.55, mean+s.e.mean from
four wells).

inhibition of lt production by troglitazone

eects of troglitazone on the antigen-induced
degranulation of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
the antigen challenge increased the release of hexosaminidase
from the cells when determined 15 min after antigen challenge
(table 3). in the presence of troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx  at 0.01 to
1 mm, antigen-induced degranulation was not inhibited (table
3). the release of hexosaminidase from non-sensitized rbl2h3 cells with ige was not increased signi®cantly by the
antigen (50 ng ml71) at 15 min (0.27+0.04, mean+s.e.mean
from four wells).

eects of troglitazone on ltb4 production by 20,0006g
supernatant of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
to avoid the in¯uence of the  xxxg147xxx  activating protein
(flap), eects of troglitazone on the ltb4 production by
the cytosol fraction of the intact rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells were
examined. as shown in figure 3, troglitazone inhibited ltb4
production by the supernatant fraction of the cell lysate in a
concentration-dependent manner. the ic50 was calculated to
be 0.38+0.04 mm (mean+s.e.mean from four independent
determinations).  xxxd3554xxx , a  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor, also inhibited
ltb4 production in a concentration-dependent manner, and
the ic50 was calculated to be 0.34+0.05 mm (mean+s.e.mean
from four independent determinations). these ®ndings
indicate that troglitazone directly inhibits  xxxg147xxx  enzyme as
 xxxd3554xxx  does.

lysate was centrifuged at 20,0006g and 48c for 20 min. an aliquot
of the supernatant fraction was preincubated for 2 h at 378c in the
presence of the indicated concentrations of troglitazone or  xxxd3554xxx ,
and further incubated for 30 min at 378c in the presence of
 xxxd208xxx  (1 mm). ltb4 produced is expressed as ng ltb4
per 1 mg protein. values are the means+s.e.mean from four samples.

eects of troglitazone on a23187-induced ltb4

to show that the eect of troglitazone is not speci®c to
antigen-induced lt production in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells, eects of
troglitazone on a23187-induced ltb4 production by rat
peritoneal neutrophils were examined. as shown in figure 4,
ltb4 production by rat peritoneal neutrophils was increased
by 1 mm a23187, and troglitazone inhibited a23187-induced
ltb4 production in a concentration-dependent manner. the
ic50 was calculated to be 0.35+0.05 mm (mean+s.e.mean
from four determinations).  xxxd3554xxx  also inhibited a23187induced ltb4 production in a concentration-dependent
manner, and the ic50 was calculated to be 0.30+0.04 mm
(mean+s.e.mean from four determinations). these ®ndings
indicate that troglitazone inhibits lt production in neutrophils as well as in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells.

discussion
in this study, we have determined the pro®le of antigeninduced lt production in ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells. the
antigen dnp-hsa (50 ng ml71) prominently increased the
production of ltb4, c4 and e4 and  xxxg1073xxx  (figure 1), the
release of [3h]- xxxd208xxx  (table 2), and cell degranulation (table 3). over the period from 30 to 60 min after antigen
stimulation, concentrations of ltb4 were decreased probably
due to o-oxidation (shak & goldstein, 1984), because the
antibody to ltb4 used in our experiment does not cross-react
with 20-carboxy ltb4 (less than 0.001%). however, at
present, there is no report suggesting that rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells
express the speci®c cytochrome p-450 responsible for ooxidation of ltb4. concentrations of ltc4 were also
decreased during this period but concentrations of lte4 were
increased slightly, suggesting that ltc4 was metabolized to
ltd4 and lte4 by g-glutamyl transpeptidase and g-glutamyl
transdipeptidase, respectively (andersen et al., 1982; orning et
al., 1982). in the present study, we could not determine
concentrations of ltd4, because a ltd4-speci®c antibody is
not available. the decrease in ltc4 levels in the conditioned
medium during the incubation period has also been reported in
mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells; c-kit ligand-induced
increase in ltc4 levels in the conditioned medium reached a
maximum  xxxd1891xxx  min and declined thereafter (murakami et al.,
1995).
we have demonstrated that troglitazone inhibits the
antigen-induced increase in the production of ltb4, c4 and
e4 in ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells (figure 2, tables 1 and 2).
the potency of the inhibitory eect of troglitazone was
comparable to that of  xxxd3554xxx , an anti-asthmatic drug and a
speci®c  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor (carter et al., 1991; dahlen et al.,
1998; tan, 1998).
because troglitazone did not aect antigen-induced  xxxg1073xxx 
production (table 1) and the release of [3h]- xxxd208xxx 
from membrane phospholipids (table 2), we suggest that
troglitazone does not inhibit cyclo-oxygenase and  xxxg1759xxx , respectively.
an inhibitory eect of troglitazone and  xxxd3554xxx  on ltb4
production was also observed in the 20,0006g supernatant
fraction of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells (figure 3), suggesting that
troglitazone inhibits  xxxg147xxx  directly. however, we cannot
exclude the possibility that troglitazone inhibits  xxxg1346xxx

hydrolase (gut et al., 1987) or glutathione-s-transferase which
metabolizes  xxxg1346xxx  into ltc4 (bach et al., 1984). as we used
the 20,0006g supernatant fraction of rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells, an eect
of troglitazone on flap, the activity of which is observed in
the nuclear fraction (woods et al., 1993), can be excluded. our
observation that the ic50 for ltb4 synthesis resembles that for
inhibition of ltc4 synthesis suggests that troglitazone inhibits
 xxxg147xxx , a common upstream enzyme for ltb4 and ltc4
synthesis. troglitazone also inhibited a23187-stimulated ltb4
production in rat peritoneal neutrophils (figure 4). this
®nding indicated that inhibition of lt production is not
speci®c to antigen-stimulated rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells.
the chemical structure of troglitazone is composed of a
thiazolidinedione ring and a chroman ring. ppar-g ligands,
including troglitazone, inhibit  xxxd2738xxx  (no) production
and induction of no synthase in macrophage-like cell lines
(ricote et al., 1998), and the ic50 of troglitazone for no
production is greater than 10 mm. ppar-g ligands also inhibit
the tumour promoter-induced production of  xxxg2296xxx  in human
monocytes, and the ic50 of troglitazone for  xxxg2296xxx  production
is 10 mm (jiang et al., 1998). ppar-g is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue and in the immune system in adult rats
(braissant et al., 1996), but it remains to be clari®ed whether
ppar-g is expressed in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells. because ic50s for the
inhibition of no production and  xxxg2296xxx  production are higher
than those for the inhibition of the antigen-induced lt
production in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells, it is possible that the inhibition
of the antigen-induced lt production by troglitazone is not
expressed through ppar-g, but is due to a direct eect on 5-

inhibition of lt production by troglitazone

lox. staels et al. (1998) demonstrated that  xxxd3147xxx , a
ppar-g-speci®c thiazolidinedione, inhibited neither il-1induced 6-keto-pgf1a production nor cyclo-oxygenase-2
protein induction in human aortic smooth muscle cells. no
eect of the ppar-g agonist  xxxd3147xxx  on il-1-induced 6keto-pgf1a production (staels et al., 1998) was noted similar
to our ®nding that troglitazone showed no eect on antigeninduced  xxxg1073xxx  production (table 1).
the lack of eect of both troglitazone and  xxxd3554xxx  on
antigen-induced degranulation of ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx 
cells (table 3) suggests that the concomitantly produced lts
do not play signi®cant roles in mast cell degranulation.
loi et al. (1997) reported that after oral administration of
troglitazone 400 mg every morning for 15 days to patients with
type ii diabetes, mean steady-state plasma cmax of troglitazone
reached 1.54 mg ml71. this concentration of troglitazone is
equivalent to 3.49 mm, and is sucient to inhibit lt
production in rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells.
in conclusion, troglitazone inhibited antigen-induced lt
production in ige-sensitized rbl- xxxd2360xxx  cells and a23187stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils as potently as  xxxd3554xxx ,
an anti-asthmatic drug and a speci®c inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx .
