abstract
 xxxg1507xxx  is a  xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycan thought to be involved in the modulation of cell adhesion and migration. its
sequence has been determined previously in rat and mouse (rauch et al., 1992. cloning and primary structure of  xxxg1507xxx , a
developmentally regulated, aggregating,  xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycan of the brain. j. biol. chem. 267, 19536–19547; rauch
et al., 1995. structure and chromosomal location of the mouse  xxxg1507xxx  gene. genomics 28, 405–410). we describe here the
complete coding sequence of the human  xxxg1507xxx  mrna, known as  xxxg1507xxx , as well as mapping data, expression analysis, and
genomic structure. a cdna known as cp-1 was initially sequenced as part of a gene discovery project focused on characterizing
chromosome 19-specific cdnas. sequence homology searches indicated close homology to the mouse and rat proteoglycan,
 xxxg1507xxx  (genbank accession nos x84727 and m97161). northern analysis identified a brain-specific transcript of approx.
7.5 kb. a longer cdna clone, gt-5, was obtained, fine-mapped to the physical map of chromosome 19 by hybridization to a
chromosome-specific cosmid library, and sequenced. full coding sequence of the mrna indicates a 3963 bp open reading frame
corresponding to a 1321 amino acid protein, similar to the protein length found in mouse and rat. the amino acid sequence of
human  xxxg1507xxx  shows 63% identity with both the mouse and rat sequences. finally, genomic sequencing of a cosmid containing
the complete  xxxg1507xxx  gene was performed to determine the genomic structure of the gene, which spans approx. 41 kb, and is
transcribed in the telomere to centromere orientation. © 1998 published by elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

development of nervous tissue. it belongs to a family of
 xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycans whose primary structure includes an immunoglobulin domain followed by a
series of tandem repeats at the n-terminus, and one or
two  xxxg681xxx -like domains, a lectin-like
domain, and a regulatory protein-like sequence at the
c-terminus. the internal portion of each proteoglycan
has no homology with any of the other proteoglycans.
various members of this family, which also include
 xxxg33xxx ,  xxxg2407xxx , and brevican, are thought to play
an important role in the inhibition of neural crest cell
migration and may serve as a barrier in the migration
of axons (oakley and tosney, 1991; snow et al., 1990a,b;
pindzola et al., 1993).  xxxg1507xxx  has previously been
shown to interact with specific molecules involved in
cell adhesion and migration (grumet et al., 1993, 1994;
milev et al., 1996), including three neuronally expressed
cell adhesion molecules (n-cam, ng–cam, and
tag-1/axonin-1) as well as an extracellular matrix
protein (tenascin). all of these molecules colocalize with

 xxxg1507xxx  (grumet et al., 1993, 1994; milev et al., 1996).
in addition,  xxxg1507xxx  has been shown to bind directly
to neurons (grumet et al., 1993) and to inhibit neurite
growth (friedlander et al., 1994).
 xxxg1507xxx  is under tight developmental regulation
with respect to immunocytochemical localization,
molecular size, and concentration in the cell.
immunocytochemical studies have shown that  xxxg1507xxx 
is expressed predominantly in the prospective white
matter and is absent from the external granule cell layer
in a 7 day postnatal rat cerebellum (rauch et al., 1991;
grumet et al., 1993). however, in an adult brain,
expression is highest in the molecular layer and completely absent in the white matter. the molecular weight
also appears to be developmentally regulated. in the
fetus, the predominant species is a 245 kda (after
removal of  xxxd1687xxx  chains) protein representing the full coding sequence of  xxxg1507xxx .  xxxd2274xxx  days
postnatal, a mixture of two forms is present, with
molecular weights of 150 kda and 245 kda. the major
species present in the adult brain is the 150 kda form,
which appears to be the result of in vivo proteolytic
processing of the larger form (rauch et al., 1992; meyerputtlitz et al., 1995). this smaller form represents the
c-terminal portion of the complete protein. finally,
studies in rat show that concentration of the  xxxg1507xxx 
protein decreases during development, from 20% of the
total  xxxd1687xxx  proteoglycan protein  xxxd2274xxx  days
postnatal to 6% in adult tissue ( rauch et al., 1991).
this paper describes the coding sequence, chromosomal localization, expression analysis by northern blot,
and genomic structure of the human  xxxg1507xxx  gene,
 xxxg1507xxx . this protein shows significant homology at the
n-terminal and c-terminal ends, as well as a limited
homology within the central region, with both mouse
and rat  xxxg1507xxx  protein. northern analysis indicates
a transcript of approx. 7.5 kb with brain-specific expression. the mrna encodes a protein containing 1321
amino acids, as well as 2.3 kb of 3∞ untranslated region.
we have mapped  xxxg1507xxx  to chromosome 19p12-13.1,
in a region previously shown to be syntenic with mouse
chromosome 8.

2. materials and methods
2.1. isolation of cdnas
the 1.4 kb cp-1 cdna was isolated from a normalized infant brain cdna library (soares et al., 1994) as
part of a chromosome 19-specific cdna selection experiment. in an attempt to find a full-length cdna, the
genetrapper kit (life technologies, gaithersberg,
md) was used according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol and custom primers designed from the
cp-1 sequence. from this experiment, a 5.0 kb cdna

referred to as gt-5 was isolated from a non-normalized
adult brain cdna library (life technologies
no. 10418-010) which partially overlapped the original
1.4 kb cp-1 cdna. further genetrapper experiments
yielded no larger clones. screening of 106 clones from a
random-primed adult brain cdna library yielded no
clones giving additional 5∞ sequence. finally, 5∞-race
(clontech, palo alto, ca) experiments were attempted
using primers race1 (5∞-ctttgggaccacgcagcat-3∞) and race2 (5∞-ccaagggggaccaaaacag-3∞) on whole brain cdna
(marathon-ready cdna, clontech) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. no clones giving additional sequence were obtained using any of these
methods.
2.2. northern blot analysis
northern blot analysis was performed using three
blots: human multiple tissue i (clontech no. 7760-1:
heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, pancreas); human brain i (clontech no. 7758-1:
amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, subthalamic
nucleus, thalamus); and human fetal i (clontech
no. 7761-1: brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung).
approximately 2 mg of polya+ rna was loaded onto
each lane. identical probes were made by pcr using
32p-dctp and vector primers t7 and sp6 to amplify
the gt-5 cdna insert containing exons 7–15 and
the 3∞ utr of  xxxg1507xxx . hybridization was performed
as described above. filters were exposed to
phosphorimager cassettes (molecular dynamics,
sunnyvale, ca) for 5 days and image analysis was
performed using the storm 860 (molecular dynamics).
2.3. mapping to chromosome 19
a chromosome 19-specific cosmid library was prepared from flow-sorted hamster–human hybrid dna at
lawrence livermore national laboratory (llnl) as
part of the national gene library project as described
previously (de jong et al., 1989). clones from this
library have been randomly arrayed and spotted onto
nylon filters using the hewlett-packard orca
(copeland and lennon, 1994). to prepare the probe,
the gt-5 cdna insert was released from the vector by
digestion with noti and sali. the insert was randomlabeled with 32p-dctp (prime-it ii, stratagene), purified
with a g-50 spin column ( worthington biochemical, la
jolla, ca), and blocked with human cot-i dna (life
technologies, lakewood, nj ). hybridization was overnight at 65°c, with the composition of the hybridization
solution as follows: 0.6 m nacl; 10 mm edta; 50 mm
tris (ph 7.4); 10%  xxxd1860xxx ; 2% sds; and 0.1%
sodium pyrophosphate. washes were also performed at

c.k. prange et al. / gene 221 (1998) 199–205

65°c as follows: one rinse in 2×ssc, 1% sds followed
by two 30 min washes in 0.2×ssc, 1% sds. filters
were exposed to phophorimager cassettes (molecular
dynamics) and analyzed with the storm 860 (molecular
dynamics). 25 cosmid clones were positive for the gt-5
probe. ecori fingerprinting data (carrano et al., 1989)
indicated that 22 of the 25 positive clones overlap in a
contiguous stretch of genomic sequence spanning 948 kb
(ashworth et al., 1995). multiple clones in this contig
have been independently mapped to the region of
19p12-13.1 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish ).
2.4. dna sequencing and analysis
the gt-5 cdna clone was sequenced using a yeast
ty1-based transposon system (perkin elmer – applied
biosystems division, foster city, ca) and the prism
dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (perkin elmer –
applied biosystems division) with custom primers
sd118 (5∞-cattggatgctgagaattcg-3∞) and
sd119 (5∞-gccgtctatcctgcttgc-3∞). samples
were run on a 377 (perkin elmer – applied biosystems
division) and sequence was analyzed using the
sequencher software package (gene codes corporation,
ann arbor, mi ).
2.5. establishment of transcript orientation
two identical ecori southern blots were prepared
from nine of the cosmids positive in the initial screening.
separate probes were made by pcr using custom oligos
designed from the 5∞ and 3∞ ends of the gt-5 cdna
and hybridized as described above. the resulting positive
fragments were compared with the ecori map of the
cosmids to determine the orientation of the transcript.
2.6. determination of exon/intron boundaries
two subclone libraries were made from one cosmid
(33494) which was predicted to contain  xxxg1507xxx  in its
entirety. cosmid dna was isolated with a
qiagen-500 (qiagen gmbh, germany) maxi-prep
and cut by sau3a partial digestion. the digest was
separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and
the region corresponding to 0.5–3 kb was isolated and
gel-purified ( eluquik, schleicher & schuell, keene,
nh ). ten nanograms of the resulting dna was ligated
into bamhi-cut m13 vector treated with cip
(boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in ) and
transfected into xl-2 blue competent cells (stratagene).
a plasmid library was constructed from a different
aliquot of the same cosmid dna. dna was digested
in separate reactions with bamhi, sau3ai, bglii, and
bcli, run on a 1% agarose gel, and the region corresponding to 1.0–3.5 kb was size-selected. dna was gelpurified ( eluquik, schleicher & schuell ) and cloned

201

into bamhi-digested pbluescript ks− and transformed
into dh10b cells (life technologies). clones from both
libraries were amplified by pcr using vector primers to
check for inserts >500 bp. dna was isolated from all
clones with suitable inserts (qiaprep-8 m13 or
qiawell-8 plasmid kit, qiagen ) and sequenced as
described above. in addition, some sequences from a
nebulized m13 library from adjacent cosmid 14150 were
analyzed for exon sequence. assembly was performed
with the sequencher software package (gene codes
corporation). cdna sequence from mouse and human
was compared with the assembled genomic sequence to
predict exon/intron boundaries. in addition, the mouse
cdna sequence was used to identify the remaining
1.3 kb of open reading frame from human genomic
sequence.

3. results
3.1. sequence analysis and exon/intron structure
the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0 kb gt-5 clone was
determined using the dye-terminator kit from abi. this
sequence, in addition to the genomic sequencing
described above, yielded 6310 bp corresponding to the
entire coding sequence and 3∞ utr of human  xxxg1507xxx 
(genbank accession no. af026547). the open reading
frame consists of 3963 bp corresponding to a 1321 amino
acid protein.
 xxxg1507xxx  spans at least 41 kb of genomic sequence as
determined by the ecori map of the region, and consists
of 14 exons which include the entire coding region and
the 3∞ utr ( table 1). the mouse gene contains an
additional exon in the 5∞ untranslated region which has
not been identified to date in humans. in order to avoid
confusion, we have maintained the same numbering for
each exon as in the mouse. therefore our numbering
starts at exon 2. we were unable to find a cdna clone
containing exons 1–6 after performing additional
genetrapper experiments, screening of a randomprimed brain cdna library, 5∞-race experiments, and
scanning of an additional 12 kb of upstream genomic
sequence.
 xxxg1507xxx  contains the characteristic n-terminal and
c-terminal domains which share homology with other
known proteoglycans, as well as a central, non-homologous region (fig. 1). the n-terminal region is made up
of an immunoglobulin domain, represented by exon 3
(amino acids 25–158), and a series of hyaluronic acidbinding tandem repeats in exons 4–6 (amino acids
159–357). this region shares 92% protein identity with
both mouse and rat  xxxg1507xxx , and at least 50% amino
acid identity with various other proteoglycan family
members from different species, including monkey,
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cow, pig, and chicken. exons 7

and 8 (amino acids 358–1007) represent the central,
non-homologous portion of the gene, with no significant
homologies found in the database with the exception of
57% (exon 7) and 29% (exon 8) amino acid identity
with both the mouse and rat  xxxg1507xxx  proteins. the
c-terminal region is made up of an epidermal growth
factor-like domain represented by exons 9 and 10 (amino
acids 1008–1083), a lectin-like domain in exons 11–13
(amino acids 1084–1211), and a complement regulatorylike domain in exon 14 (amino acids 1212–1265). as
can be expected, this entire region shows significant
levels of homology to the proteoglycan family members,
including 92% protein identity with the other neurocans
and approx. 72% amino acid similarity with proteoglycans from other species.
3.2. expression analysis
the results of the northern analysis suggest that the
 xxxg1507xxx  transcript is brain-specific (fig. 2), although
other nervous tissues were not tested. the 7.5 kb transcript is observed in both adult and fetal tissues, and in
all brain regions tested. these results are similar to those
determined previously in mouse and rat which estimate
the mrna size at approx. 7.5 kb, with expression
confined to brain and nervous tissues. scanning of
dbest using the  xxxg1507xxx  sequence reveals multiple
cdnas which are highly likely to be derived from this
transcript. these cdna clones originate from a variety
of normalized and non-normalized brain tissues, including fetal (eight clones), infant (four clones), and adult
brain (three clones) and a multiple-sclerosis brain (one
clone). as in mouse, no clones originating from a tissue

other than brain were found to have sequences derived
from the  xxxg1507xxx  transcript.
3.3. mapping of  xxxg1507xxx 
 xxxg1507xxx  maps to a well-characterized region of human
chromosome 19 (fig. 3). an ecori digest map, which
includes the cosmids positive for the  xxxg1507xxx  gene by
hybridization, spans nearly 1 mb of 19p12-13.1
(ashworth et al., 1995). this map allowed us to localize
 xxxg1507xxx  to specific ecori fragments and therefore to
determine its transcriptional orientation, with the 5∞ end
telomeric. transcriptional orientation is from telomere
to centromere;  xxxg1507xxx  is flanked on the telomeric side
by mef2b and on the centromeric side by a cluster of
zinc finger genes. additional transcripts which have been
mapped to this region include comp, uba52, ell,
several trapped exons, and anonymous ests derived
from image clones.

4. discussion
in this study we have sequenced and characterized
the human  xxxg1507xxx  gene,  xxxg1507xxx , and mapped it to
chromosome 19p12-13.1. study of its primary structure
reveals a similarity to other known proteoglycans, most
significantly with mouse and rat  xxxg1507xxx . all known
members of the proteoglycan family display a high
degree of homology with each other at the n-terminal
and c-terminal regions of the protein. functionally, it
has been shown that the n-terminal region, and specifically the tandem repeats, is involved in the mediation

of binding to  xxxd2289xxx  (rauch et al., 1991, 1992).
this binding, thought to prevent cell migration, is
interrupted by the proteolytic processing of  xxxg1507xxx ,
resulting in a truncated protein containing only the
c-terminal region which is unable to bind hyaluronic
acid. it has been shown previously that conservation of
key amino acids necessary for this binding is exhibited
in all proteoglycans (perkins et al., 1991; rauch et al.,
1992), supporting the evolutionary importance of this
function in the process of neuronal differentiation. the

human  xxxg1507xxx  protein displays the same amino acid
conservation, suggesting that it too plays a similar role
in cell migration and development of nervous tissue.
the brain- and nervous-tissue specificity displayed by
 xxxg1507xxx  marks it as a potential candidate for neurological disease. although no diseases have been mapped to
human chromosome 19p12-13.1 for which the gene
remains uncloned, there are several mouse mutants
which localize to mouse chromosome 8 in the region
conserved with human 19p12-13.1. the mouse  xxxg1507xxx 

c.k. prange et al. / gene 221 (1998) 199–205

gene has previously been mapped between the microsatellite markers d8mit29 and d8mit78 (rauch et al.,
1995). as of release 1.0 of jackson laboratory’s mouse
genome informatics [ the jackson laboratory, bar
harbor, me, february 1998. world wide web ( url:
http://www.informatics.jax.org/)], the mutant showing
the best correlation with the reported position of mouse
 xxxg1507xxx  is referred to as quinky (q), a semi-dominant
mutation characterized by circling and/or shaking behavior, as well as skeletal, tail, and inner-ear defects. in
addition to quinky, other mutants mapping close to this
region include proportional dwarf ( pdw), oligosyndactylism (os), adrenocortical dysplasia (acd), and hook (hk).
further mapping of these mouse loci relative to the
mouse  xxxg1507xxx  gene as well as mutation analysis will
be needed to test the possible role of  xxxg1507xxx  in these
disorders.
