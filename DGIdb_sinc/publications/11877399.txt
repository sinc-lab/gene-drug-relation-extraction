serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ;1  xxxg2069xxx ) is a
plp-dependent enzyme that plays a central role in the onecarbon metabolism. it catalyzes the reversible inter-conversion
of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylene
tetrahydrofolate, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of purine, thymidine, choline, and methionine (1, 2). in addition to
this physiological reaction,  xxxg2069xxx  has also been shown to cat* this work was supported by the indian council of medical research, new delhi, india. this is central drug research institute

alyze thf-independent aldolytic cleavage, decarboxylation,
racemization, and transamination reactions (3). the importance of  xxxg2069xxx  in dna synthesis coupled with the observed
high level of enzyme activity in rapidly proliferating cells has
focused attention on  xxxg2069xxx  as a potential target for the development of anticancer and antimicrobial agents (4 – 6).
several mechanisms have been proposed for the hydroxymethyl transfer, the most favored being the retroaldol cleavage
(7, 8). the crystal structures of human liver  xxxg2069xxx  (hcshmt)
and rabbit liver  xxxg2069xxx  (rcshmt) and escherichia coli  xxxg2069xxx 
(eshmt) as well as murine cytoplasmic  xxxg2069xxx  (mcshmt)
have been reported (9 –12). the structure of a reduced form of
rcshmt representing a gem diamine equivalent has also been
reported (10). although these structures have provided a
wealth of information regarding the architecture of the enzyme, active site, and residues involved in substrate binding
and catalysis, several aspects of  xxxg2069xxx  catalytic mechanism
remain uncertain (7, 13). a detailed comparison and analysis of
several structures of the enzyme corresponding to different
intermediate steps and in complex with various substrates,
substrate analogs, and product analogs are required to unravel
the finer molecular details of the catalytic mechanism. furthermore, it would be better if these structures could be compared from the same enzyme to eliminate the ambiguities
arising from differences in sequence, crystallization conditions,
and crystal packing. in this paper we describe and compare the
crystal structures of  xxxg2069xxx  from bacillus stearothermophilus
(bsshmt) in its internal aldimine form, external aldimine
form with bound serine and glycine, and as a ternary complex
with glycine and fthf. although the structures of the internal
aldimine form and ternary complex have been reported earlier
(9 –12), the external aldimine form with bound serine and glycine are presented in this paper for the first time. a detailed
analysis of bsshmt structures and a comparison with previously reported structures allows an accurate determination of
conformational changes in protein structure, orientation of the
plp ring, and key amino acid residues during different stages
of catalysis. an analysis of these results provides structural
evidence for a direct transfer mechanism for the  xxxg2069xxx  catalyzed reaction.
experimental procedures

overexpression and purification—the  xxxg2069xxx  gene was pcr-amplified from b. stearothermophilus genomic dna using the following primers: sense primer, 5⬘-gggggagctacatatgaactacttgccac-3⬘,
and antisense primer, 5⬘-gagcggaaacggatccgtcaaagcggcgac-3⬘, containing ndei and bamhi restriction sites (underlined nucleotides). the primers were designed using the sequence of  xxxg2069xxx  gene
from b. stearothermophilus available in the data base (genbanktm

serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( xxxg2069xxx ), a member
of the ␣-class of  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes, catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine to
glycine and tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. we present here the crystal structures of the
native enzyme and its complexes with serine, glycine,
glycine, and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (fthf) from bacillus stearothermophilus. the first structure of the serine-bound form of  xxxg2069xxx  allows identification of residues involved in serine binding and catalysis. the
 xxxg2069xxx -serine complex does not show any significant
conformational change compared with the native enzyme, contrary to that expected for a conversion from an
“open” to “closed” form of the enzyme. however, the
ternary complex with fthf and glycine shows the reported conformational changes. in contrast to the escherichia coli enzyme, this complex shows asymmetric
binding of the fthf to the two monomers within the
dimer in a way similar to the murine  xxxg2069xxx . comparison
of the ternary complex with the native enzyme reveals
the structural basis for the conformational change and
asymmetric binding of fthf. the four structures presented here correspond to the various reaction intermediates of the catalytic pathway and provide evidence for
a direct displacement mechanism for the hydroxymethyl transfer rather than a retroaldol cleavage.

results

 xxxg2069xxx  structure—the final model of bsshmt consists of
405 (1– 405) residues, including the n-terminal methionine.
seventeen residues were inserted at the c terminus due to the
cloning strategy employed. these residues were not visible in
the electron density map and, consequently, were not included
in the final model. the overall fold of the native enzyme is very
similar to that of other known  xxxg2069xxx  structures and other
plp-dependent enzymes of the ␣-class, such as aspartate aminotransferase. briefly, the monomer fold comprises two major
domains, the n-terminal domain (residues 1–279) and a cterminal domain (280 – 405). the n-terminal domain can be
further divided into two sub-domains, a small n-terminal subdomain (residues 1– 80) and a larger plp binding domain (residues 81–279). the small n-terminal domain comprises three

and bamhi and cloned into prset c vector at the same sites. the
clones were screened by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing. the resulting plasmid designated pr bsshmt was transferred into
e. coli bl21(de3) plyss strain. a single colony was inoculated into 50
ml of lb medium containing 50 ␮g/ml ampicillin and grown overnight
at 30 °c. these cells were used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth
medium containing 50 ␮g/ml ampicillin. after 4 h of growth at 30 °c,
the cells were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. the isopropyl-1-thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells
were harvested, resuspended in buffer a (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 1 mm
edta, 1 mm  xxxd26xxx ), and sonicated. the supernatant was
loaded on a monoq column equilibrated with buffer a. the protein was
eluted using a linear gradient with buffer a containing 1 m nacl. the
fractions containing the protein were pooled and loaded on a phenyl
superose column equilibrated with buffer a containing 1 m ammonium
sulfate. the protein was eluted using the same buffer without ammonium sulfate. the fractions containing the protein were pooled and
precipitated using ammonium sulfate (65% saturation). the pellet was
resuspended in buffer b (100 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.5, 0.2 mm edta,
5 mm  xxxd26xxx , 100 mm nacl) and further purified on a
superdex-200 (amersham biosciences) gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer b. peak fractions corresponding to the dimer were
pooled and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using a 50-kda cutoff centricon
(amicon).
crystallization— xxxg2069xxx  protein crystals were grown by hanging drop
vapor diffusion method at 25 °c. protein crystals were obtained by
mixing 4 ␮l of protein solution with 4 ␮l of reservoir solution containing
100 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.5, 0.2 mm edta, 5 mm  xxxd26xxx ,
50% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. crystals started appearing within 4 –5
days and grew to a maximum size in 5–10 days.  xxxg2069xxx  crystals complexed with serine and glycine were obtained under the same condition
as that of the native protein, except that the reservoir solution contained additional 10 mm serine or glycine. the ternary complex crystal
of  xxxg2069xxx  with glycine and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (sigma) were obtained by adding fthf to the protein solution (2 mm final concentration) and 10 mm glycine to the reservoir solution. the hanging drops
were incubated for 3 h at 18 –20 °c and subsequently transferred to
room temperature (25 °c).
x-ray diffraction data collection and processing—crystals were
soaked for a few seconds in a harvesting solution containing 100 mm
hepes buffer, ph 7.5, 0.2 mm edta, 5 mm  xxxd26xxx , 50%
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 25% glycerol and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream (oxford cryosystems) at 100 k. x-ray diffraction data were
collected on a rigaku ru-300 x-ray generator using mar345 image
plate detector. the hkl suite was used for data reduction and scaling
(14). the native crystals as well as the serine and glycine complex
crystals belonged to the space group p21212 with one monomer in the
asymmetric unit. these crystals diffracted to better than a 2 å resolution. final data sets were collected to a 1.93 å resolution. the ternary
complex crystals with glycine and fthf belonged to the space group
p21 with a dimer in the asymmetric unit and diffracted poorly compared
with the native crystals. the final data set was collected to a resolution
of 2.7 å. details of cell dimensions and data collection statistics for the
native and various complex crystals are shown in table i.
structure determination and model building—initially the struc-

ture of the internal aldimine form (native form) was determined by
molecular replacement technique. a  xxxd2428xxx  model of the structure
of e. coli  xxxg2069xxx , which shows a sequence identity of 60.8% with the
bsshmt sequence, served as an excellent search model (protein data
bank entry 1df0). the final model was composed of residues 5– 403 of
the e. coli structure, modified by omission of residues 243–245 corresponding to insertion in the e. coli sequence, based on sequence alignments using clustalw (15). rotation and translation searches were
made using the ccp4 (16) program amore (17). best solutions were
obtained using the data between 10 and 3 å of resolution. the transformed model was subjected to rigid body refinement using the program
xplor (18). the n- and c-terminal domains (residues 5–280 and
281– 403) of the model were refined independently during rigid body
refinement. the phases were improved and extended to 1.93 å of
resolution by solvent flattening using the program dm (19). these
phases were used to calculate a 2fo ⫺ fc map and visualized using the
graphics program turbo-frodo (20). the map was readily interpretable, and the electron density for the plp cofactor, which was omitted
from the model, was clearly visible. most of the side chains were built
into the map, and the model was refined using maximum likelihood
positional refinement in refmac, with restrained temperature factors
(21). after each cycle of refinement, manual rebuilding was performed
wherever necessary, and previously undefined side chains were built
into the electron density map. the plp molecule from the eshmt
structure was manually adjusted and built into the electron density
map. solvent molecules were added during final cycles of refinement.
the crystallographic free r-factor (22) was monitored at each stage to
prevent model bias. the quality of the structure was evaluated using
the ramachandran plot and the program procheck (23). statistics
on the final model are presented in table i.
the electron density maps for the serine and glycine complex crystals
were computed using data to a 1.93 å resolution from these crystals and
refined phases from the native  xxxg2069xxx  model without plp and solvent
molecules. the models for the serine- and glycine-bound form were
subsequently refined in the same manner as the native form. the model
for the ternary form with bound glycine and fthf was obtained by
molecular replacement searches using the native form as the search
model. the two monomers in the asymmetric unit were subjected to
rigid body refinement before manual model building and subsequent
refinement. strict non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (tight restraints for main chain and medium restraints for the side chain) were
applied during refinement. the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were gradually reduced and completely relaxed during the final
round of refinement. although one of the subunits showed a good
electron density for the bound fthf molecule, the other subunit revealed a much weaker density for the fthf, and there was no appreciable density for the monoglutamate side chain. initially the fthf
molecule from the e. coli structure was manually adjusted and built
into the electron density map for the subunit, showing good density for
the bound fthf. during the final stages of refinement, part of the
fthf molecule (without the monoglutamate side chain) for the other
subunit was also included in the model.
comparison of the bsshmt structures and earlier reported structures were carried out by manual superposition followed by rigid body
refinement option in turbo-frodo as well as with the ccp4 program lsqkab. differences between the structures were detected visually and by calculating the distances between corresponding c␣ atoms.
differences in the orientation of the plp ring were calculated using the
ccp4 program geomcalc.

␣-helices and one ␤-strand, whereas the larger n-terminal
domain folds into an ␣␤␣ structure consisting of a sevenstranded mixed ␤-sheet flanked by ␣-helices on both sides. the
c-terminal domain folds into an ␣␤ sandwich. all the shmts
studied to date are either homodimers or homotetramers, the
dimer being the minimum structure necessary for the catalytic
activity. the four known structures of  xxxg2069xxx  (hc-, rc-, mc-, and
eshmt) are all reported to be tetramers, although the quaternary organization of eshmt structure is different from the
mammalian  xxxg2069xxx  structures (9 –12). in contrast, the quaternary structure of bsshmt is a dimer. the crystallographic
asymmetric unit consists of a monomer, and the two monomers

of the dimer are related by the crystallographic symmetry. no
tetrameric contacts are visible in the crystal structure. this is
consistent with the gel filtration experiments (data not shown),
which shows that the protein elutes at a position corresponding
to a dimer. the overall structure of the bsshmt is depicted in
fig. 1.
serine and glycine external aldimine complexes—the
structures of the serine and glycine complexes of bsshmt are
virtually identical to that of the native enzyme except for local
conformational changes involving the plp ring and side-chain
atoms in the active site region. when compared with the native
structure, the serine and glycine complexes show a root mean

square deviation of 0.11 and 0.13 å, respectively, over the 405
superposed c␣ atoms. several studies have suggested that
 xxxg2069xxx  undergoes a conformational change upon binding of
substrates with a 3-hydroxyl group, resembling the transition
that occurs in aspartate aminotransferase from an “open” to
“closed” form on binding of the aspartate or 2-methylaspartate
substrates (24 –26). thermal stability of the  xxxg2069xxx  increases
upon binding of serine, and this change in thermal stability of
the enzyme has been attributed to a conformational change in
 xxxg2069xxx , like that in aspartate aminotransferase (27–30). the
crystal structures of mcshmt and eshmt complexed to gly-

cine and fthf indeed show a conformational change compared
with the unliganded hc- and rcshmt structures. however, the
observed conformational changes have been largely attributed
to the binding of the amino acid substrate (11). the structures
of serine and glycine aldimine forms of bsshmt clearly show
that the amino acid substrate binding alone does not induce
significant conformational changes in the protein. the conformational changes observed earlier could be a result of fthf
binding. the reported thermal stability of the enzyme is most
likely due to the interaction of the serine with the enzyme,
particularly those that bridge the two monomers of the dimer,
and filling the active site cavity.
the electron density for the bound amino acid substrates was
very clear, allowing the substrate to be placed unambiguously.
the electron density around the bound serine substrate is
shown in fig. 2. the plp ring in the serine complex rotates by
⬃24° (primarily around the c5-c5⬘ bond) compared with its
internal aldimine form (fig. 3). a similar rotation of the plp
ring has been reported for aspartate aminotransferase (⬃25°)
and between the reduced and unreduced forms of rcshmt
structures (31, 32, 10). in contrast, only a small rotation of the
plp ring (⬃8°) has been reported in the e. coli ternary complex
structure relative to the unliganded hc- and rcshmt structures (11). however, the plp ring in the e. coli structure shows
a rotation of about 21° compared with the native form of
bsshmt. the orientation of the plp is very similar between
the two external aldimine forms of the bsshmt, except for
minor movements in the serine complex, to accommodate the

additional interactions due to the hydroxyl group of the serine.
the bound serine substrate makes several interactions with
both the monomers of the protein. the bound glycine shows
exactly the same interactions, except for those formed by the
hydroxyl group of the serine. the hydroxyl group of serine is in
close proximity of the carboxylate group of glub53 (2.5 å). it is
also within hydrogen-bonding distance from the imidazole
group of hisa122 (2.80 å). the carboxylate group of serine
forms a tight ion pair with arga357. in addition, one of the
oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group also interacts with the
imidazole of hisa200, and the other can form hydrogen bonds
with the side chains of sera31 and tyrb61. an interesting
conformational change observed is that of tyr-61 (fig. 3). in
the native structure, the side chain of tyrb61 is within hydrogen-bonding distance from arga357 (2.72 å), away from
glub53 (5 å). however, in the serine complex, it flips toward
glub53, away from arga357, presumably due to the interaction of the substrate carboxylate group with arga357. this
conformational change leads to new interaction of tyrb61 with
glub53 and serine carboxylate group and brings the hydroxyl
group of tyrb61 close to the c␤ of serine (2.81 å).
the ternary complex—the ternary complex of bsshmt
with bound glycine and fthf shows small but significant
conformational changes compared with the native structure,
similar to that observed in the structures of mc- and eshmt
(11, 12). a remarkable feature of the ternary complex structure
of bsshmt is the lack of structural symmetry and differences
in the fthf interaction between the two monomers of the
dimer. although one of the monomers showed a strong density
for the fthf molecule (monomer a), the other monomer revealed a much weaker density, and there was no appreciable
density for the monoglutamate part of the molecule in that

monomer (monomer b; see “discussion”).
the first clue toward the asymmetry between the two monomers came from the breakdown of orthorhombic symmetry in
the crystals of the ternary complex. the crystals of the native
and aldimine forms belong to the orthorhombic system with a
monomer in the asymmetric unit, whereas the ternary complex
crystals belong to the monoclinic system, with a dimer in the
asymmetric unit, although the cell dimensions were not very
different from the other three forms (table i). when compared
with the native form, both the monomers of the ternary complex show movements in the c-terminal domain (residues 280 –
405) and parts of the n-terminal domain, particularly around
the active site region. the difference between the two monomers of the dimer in the ternary complex appear to be mainly
in the extent of these movements. a comparison of the monomer a (showing good density for fthf) of the bsshmt ternary
complex to the native structure shows a difference of about 4°
in the hinge angle between the n- and c-terminal domains,
whereas this difference is only 2.5° in the monomer b.
a superposition of the monomer a of the bsshmt ternary
complex with the native structure is shown in fig. 4. apart
from an overall movement of the c-terminal domain, the ternary complex structure reveals most obvious differences in the
region of residues 315–330 and 342–352 of the c-terminal

structures of the ternary complexes of the mc- and eshmt (11,

with the carboxylate group of glycine substrate appears to
cause a small movement in this region, which is further enhanced by the overall movement of the c-terminal domain. the
exocyclic nitrogen of the pteridine ring of fthf interacts with
the main chain carbonyl oxygens of the residues leu-117, gly120, and gly-121, inducing a small movement in the region
114 –119. the position of the loop region 342–352 appears to be
important for the fthf binding. the major difference between
the two monomers of bsshmt appears to be in this loop region.
the structural basis for the conformational change in the protein as well as the asymmetric binding of the fthf will be
discussed in the next section.
the bound fthf molecule is involved in several interactions
with the protein. briefly, the carboxylate group of glu-53 interacts with the formyl oxygen atom and the n10 atom of the
fthf. the side chain of asn-341 is within hydrogen-bonding
distance from n1 and n8 atoms of the pteridine ring. the c2
amino group of fthf interacts with the main chain carbonyl
oxygen atoms of residues leu-117, gly-120, and gly-121. the
main chain carbonyl oxygen of the residue gly-121 and the
amide group of the residue leu-123 forms hydrogen bonds with
the n3 and o4 atoms of fthf molecule. the p-aminobenzoic
acid moiety of the fthf stacks against the side chain of tyr60. the monoglutamate part of the molecule makes only one
significant interaction with the hydroxyl group of ser-349 (only
in monomer a). a stereo view of the fthf binding site is
shown in fig. 5, and details of the interactions made by fthf
in both the monomers are presented in table ii. the overall

position and orientation of fthf molecule in bsshmt is similar to that in the e. coli structure. between the two monomers
of bsshmt, the pteridine ring and the phenyl ring of the fthf
reveal small displacements, and there was no density for the
monoglutamate part of the fthf in the monomer b. the
average temperature factor associated with the fthf in monomer b (⬃45) was higher when compared with that in monomer a (⬃37). furthermore, the interactions of fthf in monomer b are much weaker compared with those in monomer a
(table ii).
plp binding site—details of interactions made by the plp
in the four structures of bsshmt are presented in table iii.
the overall environment of the plp, including the interacting
protein ligand groups and the ring stacking histidine, is very
similar to that found in the known  xxxg2069xxx  structures (9 –12). it
is clear from table iii that these interactions are mostly conserved during different intermediate steps of the catalytic cycle. the interaction of the n⑀ atom of the lys-226 with the
thr-223 is particularly interesting. the thr-223 (226 in eshmt) has been implicated in stabilizing the external aldimine
form based on mutational studies (33), which was further confirmed by the crystal structures. in the external aldimine structures of bsshmt, lys-226 forms strong hydrogen-bonding interaction with this residue (2.89 å), similar to that in the
eshmt structure. however, in the ternary complex, this interaction is much weaker, particularly in the monomer b (3.17 å),
and instead, a stronger interaction is made between lys-226
and tyrb51 (2.8 å). tyr-51 appears to play a role in the con-

discussion

structural basis for the conformational changes and asymmetric binding of the fthf—the crystal structures of the
ternary complexes of e. coli, murine, and bsshmt clearly
establish a small but significant conformational change in the
protein compared with the native form, similar to those observed in aspartate aminotransferase (11, 12, 34). in all three
structures, the c-terminal domain moves relative to the nterminal domain, and most obvious differences are observed in
the loop region 342–352 (390 – 400 in mcshmt, around 350 in

eshmt). the position of this loop appears to be important for
the binding of the folate cofactor. although it was suggested in
the mcshmt structure that the binding of the folate induces a
shift in this region, the structural requirement for such a
movement was unclear (12). a superposition of the ternary
complex of bsshmt with the native form reveals that the side
chain of phe-351 in the native structure sterically prevents the
monoglutamate side chain of the fthf from binding in that
position unless the loop is moved away from that region (fig.
6). the monoglutamate side chain of the fthf molecule in the
bsshmt (monomer a) occupies the same position as the side
chain of phe-351 in the native structure, necessitating a move-

residue has been implicated in plp binding rather than proton
abstraction (37). the most favored conformation for this type of
cleavage reaction is an antiperiplanar geometry of the atoms
involved in electron movement (38). however, the geometry at
the c␤ atom of the serine substrate in the external aldimine
complex of bsshmt is not antiperiplanar, instead showing a
n-c␣-c␤-o␥ dihedral angle of 40°, which is not most favorable
for the retroaldol cleavage. thus, the lack of suitable base for
proton abstraction as well as the unfavorable conformation of
the bound serine suggests the need to consider alternative
mechanisms for catalysis more seriously.
the absence of a cysteine residue in close proximity of the
active site clearly rules out the possibility of a thiohemiacetal
mechanism, which involves nucleophilic attack of a cysteine
residue on the ␤-carbon of the serine. another possible mechanism is the direct displacement of the c␣ bond of the serine
aldimine by the phenolate ion of the tyr-61 residue, leading to
the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate. as discussed earlier, tyr-61 residue undergoes a conformational change upon
serine binding and approaches the c␤ atom of the serine (2.8
å). however, this type of nucleophilic substitution mechanism
(sn2 attack) requires that the nucleophile attacks the carbon
atom from the side opposite bond to the leaving group at an
angle roughly 180° to the carbon bond of the leaving group (39).
the hydroxyl group of tyr-61 in bsshmt makes an angle
c␣-c␤-o of 94°, which is orthogonal to the carbon bond of the
leaving group and, therefore, not favorable for such a mechanism. furthermore, mutation analysis of the corresponding
residue in the eshmt as well as sheep liver cytosolic  xxxg2069xxx  do
not suggest the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate (36, 40).
however, the structures of the bsshmt with serine and ternary
complex favors a direct attack of the thf on the serine aldimine
(direct displacement mechanism; scheme ii). assuming no further changes in the position or conformation of the bound serine,
a superposition of the serine and ternary complex structures
reveals a distance of 2.5 å between the n5 atom of fthf and the
␤-carbon of the serine, optimal for a nucleophilic attack. furthermore, the angle for nucleophilic attack in this model (as determined by the angle n5-c␤-c␣) is ⬃135°. both the distance and
angle are appropriate for a direct attack by the n5 atom of thf
at the ␤-carbon of the serine aldimine. taken together, these
results appear to favor a direct displacement mechanism for the
conversion of serine to glycine by  xxxg2069xxx . however, the thfindependent cleavage of other ␤-hydroxyamino acids could still
proceed by a retroaldol cleavage mechanism.

ment of this region away from the monoglutamate binding site.
the interaction of asn-341 with n1 and n8 atoms of the pteridine ring appears to facilitate the shift in this loop position.
the spectral and titration calorimetric studies on the rcshmt have indicated that the ternary complex of the enzyme
with glycine and fthf exists in equilibrium consisting of
quinonoid, external aldimine, and gem diamine forms (3, 25,
35), which is confirmed by the crystal structure of the mcshmt
(12). in the mcshmt structure, the two obligate dimers forming the tetramer reveal asymmetric binding of the fthf, and
a loop region (b154-b160) has been implicated in this (12). in
contrast, all the active sites of the two dimers in the eshmt
appear to bind glycine and fthf in a very similar manner (11).
the differences in the fthf binding properties of the murine
and e. coli  xxxg2069xxx  has been attributed to the tetrameric nature
of the mammalian enzyme and critical residues in the tetrameric contact region, which are lacking in the e. coli enzyme
(12). the bsshmt ternary complex exhibits asymmetric binding of fthf despite being a dimeric enzyme and lacking the
residues corresponding to the loop region 154 –160 in the murine structure. the most likely candidate causing the asymmetric binding of fthf in bsshmt appears to be the stacking
interaction of the imidazole ring of his-108 from the two monomers at the dimer interface of the molecule (fig. 7). the binding of the folate cofactor results in a small shift in the region
114 –119. this movement could be transmitted to the same
region of the other subunit via the stacking interaction of the
his108 from the two monomers. in other words the displacement in the region 114 –119 of the monomer a prevents a
similar movement in the monomer b, affecting the binding of
fthf in the monomer b. in the mcshmt structure, a similar
stacking interaction was observed involving his-135 residues
(equivalent of his-108) belonging to the two dimers (a-c, b-d)
of the tetramer. it is interesting to note that although the
asymmetry is found between the two monomers of the dimer of
bsshmt, it is observed between the two obligate dimers of the
mcshmt. in eshmt on the other hand, which does not exhibit
asymmetry in fthf binding, the residue corresponding to
his-108 is a proline (p112), and consequently, no stacking
interaction is observed in that structure.
mechanistic implications—several reaction mechanisms
have been proposed for the cleavage and transfer of the hydoxymethyl group of serine, the favored mechanism being the
retroaldol cleavage (7). the retroaldol cleavage mechanism
(scheme i) requires a catalytic base to abstract a proton from
the ␥-hydroxyl group of serine and a favorable conformation of
the bound substrate for the cleavage reaction to occur. the
structure of bsshmt serine complex reveals two possible candidates for the base, which abstracts a proton from the hydroxyl group of the serine. the side chain carboxylate of glu-53
and the imidazole group of his-122 (stacking with plp) are in
close proximity of the hydroxyl group of the serine. the side
chain carboxylate of glu-53 has been reported to be in its acid
form (protonated), not the conjugated base, in the crystal structure of eshmt (11). the interaction of glu-53 in the structure
of bsshmt further confirms this observation. the glu-53 interacts with 5-formyl oxygen of fthf in the ternary complex
and with immobilized water molecules in the native glycine
aldimine as well as in the ternary complex structures of
bsshmt, indicating that it is in its protonated form. mutation
of the equivalent residue in scshmt (e74q) has suggested that
this residue is not involved in proton abstraction (36). if glu-53
is in a protonated state, then the only other candidate for the
base involved in proton abstraction is his-122. a substantial
amount of activity is retained upon mutation of the corresponding residue in sheep liver cytosolic  xxxg2069xxx  (h147n), and this
