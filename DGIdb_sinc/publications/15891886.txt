cyclooxygenase inhibitors modulate nk activities that control
metastatic disease

abstract cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibitors have demonstrated eﬃcacy in models of human cancer but the
relevant mechanisms have not all been elucidated. both
cox-dependent as well as cox-independent mechanisms
have been implicated. using a syngeneic model of metastatic breast cancer, we have investigated the eﬀect of
cox inhibitors on nk functions that are critical to the
control of metastatic disease. nk recognition of target
cells is governed by a balance of activating and inhibiting receptors that bind ligands including mhc class i.
we now show that treatment of tumor cells with the
nonselective cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor indomethacin or
the selective cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib leads to decreased expression of the mhc class i molecules ld and
kd . downregulated class i expression is associated with
concomitant increased sensitivity to nk cell-mediated
lysis. both cox inhibitors limit tumor metastasis and
this therapeutic eﬀect is dependent on nk but not t cell
function. antimetastatic activity is also lost in the absence of interferon- c (ifn-c). both cox inhibitors also
suppress local tumor growth of subcutaneously implanted mammary tumor cells in immune competent
balb/cbyj mice. this therapeutic activity is lost in the
absence of either cd4+ or cd8+ t cells, but is not
compromised by the loss of nk activity. thus, the
mechanism of tumor inhibition diﬀers in the context of
local versus metastatic disease. taken together, these
ﬁndings are consistent with a mechanism not previously
described, whereby cox inhibitors may relieve mhcmediated inhibition of nk cytotoxicity leading to recognition and lysis of metastatic tumor cells.

introduction
we have reported that nonselective (indomethacin) and
selective (celecoxib, sc560) cyclooxygenase inhibitors
limit growth and metastasis of highly aggressive murine
mammary carcinomas [11]. many mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the therapeutic eﬀects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (coxibs) demonstrated against
many tumor types. evidence for direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, blockade of cell cycle progression,
induction of apoptosis and indirect eﬀects on tumor
angiogenesis, have been reported [9, 16–18, 28]. using a
syngeneic murine model of metastatic breast cancer, we
asked whether some of the beneﬁcial eﬀects of coxibs are
attributable to modulation of tumor-protective immune
mechanisms. the current report indicates that immune
eﬀector mechanisms contribute to therapeutic eﬀects of
coxibs, but the critical eﬀector cell is context-dependent.
we provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which
coxibs modulate nk recognition leading to enhanced
tumor cell lysis.

sodium bicarbonate and 0.1 mm nonessential amino

injected into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic immune

(jackson laboratories, bar harbor, me, usa), and
immune compromised c.b-17/icrcrl-balb/scid/br
and c.b-17/icrcrl-balb/scid/beige (charles river
laboratories, wilmington, ma, usa) female mice. for
experimental metastasis assays, 3 · 105 tumor cells were
injected into the lateral tail vein, and 21 days later, the
mice were sacriﬁced and pulmonary metastases were
quantiﬁed.
cox inhibitor treatments
the selective cox-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, was a generous
gift of pharmacia (st. louis, mo, usa). the dual cox
inhibitor, indomethacin, was purchased from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis). both drugs were dissolved in a
solution of  xxxd2609xxx  (0.5%) and tween 20
(0.025%) and administered by oral gavage twice/day to
achieve a dose of 5/mg/kg/day (celecoxib) or 1 mg/kg/
day (indomethacin). control animals were gavaged daily
with vehicle. to determine the direct eﬀect of cox
inhibitors on tumor cells, in the absence of host eﬀects,
410.4 cells were cultured in the presence of indomethacin, celecoxib (1.0 lm) dmso or ethanol for 48 h,
washed, and 3·105 viable tumor cells were injected into
the tail vein of untreated mice. no further drug treatments were carried out.
antibody depletion
to deplete nk cells, mice were injected with rabbit
asialogm1 ganglioside antibody (20 ll, wako bioproducts, richmond, va, usa). cd4+ and cd8+
cells were depleted with rat hybridoma supernatants
(500 ll atcc 2.43 and atcc  xxxd955xxx .5, respectively,
atcc, rockville, md, usa). control animals were
treated with normal rabbit serum (asialogm1) or normal rat ig (cd4, cd8 depletions). all antibody treatments were administered 1 day prior to and either
3 days (metastasis assays) or 7 days (mammary fat pad
tumors) after tumor introduction. these protocols deplete approximately 50% of non-mhc-restricted tumor
cell lysis; approximately 50% of cd4+ t cells and 90%
of cd8+ cells spleen cells are depleted as indicated by
ﬂow cytometry.
flow cytometry
tumor cells were cultured in optimem medium for
48 h in the presence of cox inhibitors or appropriate
vehicle for 48 h and stained for mhc class i as described previously [12]. cells were reacted with antibody
to h-2l d (clone 30-5-7) or h-2k d (clone sf1-1.1.1).
secondary antibody was ﬂuorescein-conjugated goatanti-mouse igg (bd biosciences pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa). fluorescence analyzed by facscan ﬂow
cytometer.

nk cytotoxicity assays
assays were carried out as described in ref. 12. tumor
target cells were labeled with [3 h] proline, washed and
plated in 96-well ﬂat-bottom microtiter plates in the
presence of cox inhibitors at the indicated concentrations. after a further 48 h, single cell suspensions of
spleen eﬀector cells from normal balb/cbyj female mice
(stimulated with 100 lg of poly-ic ip 24 h prior to
sacriﬁce) were added at a 100:1 eﬀector to target ratio.
lytic activity is linear using ratios of 1:10, 1:50 or 1:100.
after a further 18 h incubation, nonadherent cells were
aspirated, and radioactivity in the remaining adherent
cells was determined. cytotoxicity was determined as: %
cytotoxicity = 1 (cpm remaining in experimental well/
cpm remaining in medium control well)·100.

results
therapeutic activity of cox inhibition has been examined in a number of rodent models [10,11, 17, 19, 22, 25,
27]. these studies have implicated several mechanisms of
therapeutic action including tumor cell apoptosis, and
inhibition of both proliferation and angiogenesis. suppressive eﬀects of the cox-2 product, pge2, on immune
eﬀector cells are also well documented [3, 4]. nevertheless,
the precise mechanisms by which cox inhibitors limit
tumor growth are not entirely elucidated. we determined
the eﬀect of cox inhibitors on tumor metastasis and
examined the requirements for immune eﬀector populations in control of metastatic dissemination. in order to
isolate eﬀects of cox inhibitors on tumor cells, we pretreated 410.4 mammary tumor cells with cox inhibitors
prior to intravenous administration of tumor cells into
either immune competent balb/cbyj mice, or immune
incompetent severe combined immune deﬁcient scid
mice, nk-depleted mice or mice lacking interferon-c
(ifn- c). pretreatment of 410.4 tumor cells with indo
(1 lm), prior to intravenous injection of tumor cells, resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of experimental metastases (55% inhibition) (fig. 1a). indo was
still eﬀective at controlling metastases in scid mice
lacking mature t and b cell function. the ability of indo
to limit tumor metastases was, however, completely
abrogated in mice lacking either nk function or ifn-c.
likewise, treatment with celecoxib (1.0 lm) resulted in a
38% decrease in lung metastases (fig. 1b). like indo, the
therapeutic eﬀect of celecoxib was compromised in either
nk-depleted or ifn-c-depleted mice. thus, nk function
is critical to the mechanism by which coxibs control
metastatic dissemination.

balb/cbyj, balb/scid, or balb/ifnc -/- mice as well as balb/cbyj
mice treated with asialogm1 antibody (nk-/-). b tumor cells

to examine potential mechanisms by which coxibs
and nk interact, we determined the eﬀect of coxibs on
nk-mediated lysis of mammary tumor cells. labeled
410.4 target cells were cultured in the presence of indo
or celecoxib for 48 h, spleen cells from normal mice were
added to tumor targets and tumor cell lysis was analyzed. figure 2a shows that vehicle-treated 410.4 cells
are relatively resistant to non-mhc restricted cytotoxicity, however, the addition of either indo (fig. 2a) or
celecoxib (fig. 2b) resulted in statistically signiﬁcant
increased lytic activity in a dose-dependent manner.
coxibs induce apoptosis of many cells and the apparent
increased nk-lytic sensitivity could have resulted from
direct apoptosis of the tumor target cell. this is an unlikely mechanism, however, since these cells have been
shown to be resistant to apoptosis-induction by coxibs
[13]. furthermore, lytic activity indicated in the ﬁgure is
corrected for spontaneous killing in the absence of

eﬀector cells and thus reﬂects a true increase in lysis
mediated by immune eﬀector cells.
the immunosuppressive role of the cyclooxygenase
product pge2 on nk activities is documented [4, 15]. it
is not surprising, therefore, that in the presence of indo
or celecoxib, increased nk lytic activity is observed.
this data is consistent with a model in which tumorpge2 directly suppresses nk function. we considered
the possibility that intrinsic properties of the tumor cells
were also changed, rendering the cells more sensitive to
nk-mediated killing. activation of nk recognition and
target cell lysis is mediated by loss of mhc class i
expression [24]. we tested the hypothesis that coxibs
might modulate expression of mhc class i molecules on
tumor target cells. we cultured 410.4 tumor cells in the
presence of increasing concentrations of indo or celecoxib and examined mhc class i expression by ﬂow
cytometry. figure 2c shows that treatment of 410.4 cells
with indo or celecoxib (2d) resulted in partial loss of
expression of mhc class i at the ld locus in a dosedependent manner. downregulation at the kd locus was
also observed. treatment with celecoxib at 5,10, 15 or
20 lm reduced mhc kd by 1, 4, 7 and 25%, respectively. thus, celecoxib aﬀected the expression of both
loci, but the eﬀect on ld expression was more pronounced. to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that
coxibs can modulate mhc class i expression.
to rule out nonspeciﬁc eﬀects of coxibs on mhc
expression, we determined if addition of exogenous
pge2 could reverse the coxib-mediated suppression of
class i expression. cells were treated with indo (20.0 or
40.0 lm) and pge2 (1.0 or 10 lm) was also added to
some cultures. in the presence of indo alone, mhc kd
was decreased in comparison to vehicle-treated control
cells (fig. 3). when pge2 was added to indo-treated
cells, mhc expression was restored to vehicle control
levels. thus, exogenous pge2 was able to reverse the
indo-mediated decrease in mhc class i expression.
similarly, downregulation of mhc expression by celecoxib was completely reversed when cells were also
exposed to ifn-c (100 units/ml) for 24 h (data not
shown).
immune eﬀector mechanisms that control tumor
behavior can diﬀer depending on whether local tumor
growth or metastatic dissemination is considered. thus,
nk cells are clearly important to coxib-mediated control of metastasis. we considered the possibility that
diﬀerent eﬀector cells control local disease. to examine
the potential contribution of immune function to the
observed therapeutic eﬀects of cox inhibitors on local
tumor growth, we transplanted 5·105 of line 410.4 tumor cells to immunologically competent balb/cbyj mice
or to immunodeﬁcient balb/scid or balb/scid/beige
female mice. therapeutic eﬃcacy of indo and celecoxib
was compared in these three strains of mice. drugs or
vehicle control were administered by oral gavage until
day 28. figure 4 shows that administration of either
drug resulted in statistically signiﬁcant inhibition of
tumor size in immune-competent balb/cbyj mice in

comparison with vehicle-treated controls. indo or celecoxib-mediated tumor growth inhibition was completely lost in animals lacking t and b lymphocyte
eﬀector functions (scid) or mice with an additional loss
of nk cell function (scid/beige).
to further examine the role of t cell subsets and to
more directly investigate the role of nk cells, the therapeutic activity of indo was evaluated in balb/cbyj mice
depleted of cd4+ or cd8+ cells or nk cells (fig. 5).
depletion of either cd4+ or cd8+ cells compromised
the tumor growth inhibition mediated by indo, whereas
loss of nk activity had no apparent eﬀect on therapeutic activity. in contrast to control of metastatic disease, these two experiments implicate a role for t
lymphocytes in the mechanism by which coxibs limit

growth of locally growing tumors, but indicate that this
therapeutic eﬀect is not dependent on nk function.

discussion
high cox-2 expression is a common feature of many
tumors including those of the breast [1, 21, 26]. it has
been known for many years that increased cox activity,
in the form of prostaglandin synthesis and, more recently, expression of the cox-2 protein, is associated
with more aggressive disease and increased likelihood of
metastatic disease [1, 21]. furthermore, epidemiological
evidence supports a protective role for nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs in breast cancer incidence [6–8].
these ﬁndings have resulted in the initiation of a number
of clinical trials in breast, as well as other cancers, to
evaluate eﬃcacy of cox-2 inhibitors.
we have shown that, in a murine model that mimics
metastatic human breast cancer, high cox-2 expression
and enzymatic activity are associated with more
tumorigenic and metastatic behavior [2, 14]. these tumors also express the cox-1 isoform, and we reported
that selective cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitors, as well as a
dual cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor, reduce tumor size and
inhibit metastasis [11]. other laboratories have also

shown the protective eﬀects of cox inhibitors both in
preventing tumor induction and inhibiting growth of
transplanted tumors [10, 17, 19, 22, 27]. those studies
have implicated several mechanisms underlying the
therapeutic eﬀects. direct eﬀects of cox inhibitors on
tumor cells have been demonstrated including inhibition
of proliferation [9] and induction of apoptosis [16].

either vehicle, indomethacin (indo) or celecoxib (cele) at a dosage
of 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg/day, respectively. tumor diameters were

other studies support an indirect eﬀect of cox inhibitors on tumor angiogenesis [17, 18, 22, 28].
we now demonstrate a role for immune eﬀector cells
in coxib-mediated tumor inhibition. using both celldepletion and genetic approaches, we show that control
of local tumor growth depends on both cd4+ and
cd8+ t cells, but not nk cells. although nk cells
appeared not to be important to the mechanism by
which coxibs control local tumor growth, it was
important to examine the role of nk cells in a model of
metastatic disease. we had shown previously, and conﬁrm here, that pretreatment of 410.4 tumor cells with
sublethal concentrations of indo, celecoxib or ns398,
prior to intravenous introduction into immune competent mice, reduced the number of lung tumor colonies by
50–89% [11]. the current results show that control of
metastatic disease by cox inhibitors is dependent on
both nk function and ifn-c, but, in contrast to local
disease, does not require functional t cells. thus, coxibs
are eﬀective at controlling local tumors as well as metastatic disease, but the critical eﬀector cell depends on
the tumor site.
cox inhibitor-mediated control of tumor growth has
been reported in other tumor models [10, 15, 17, 27].
some of these studies were carried out using xenotransplants in immune-incompetent hosts. those studies
have identiﬁed apoptosis induction and inhibition of
tumor angiogenesis as critical therapeutic mechanisms.
the current studies identify additional immune-dependent mechanisms. the relative dependence on immunologic versus nonimmunologic mechanisms many vary
for diﬀerent model systems. models in which tumor
inhibition is achieved by other mechanisms typically

986

employ higher doses of celecoxib (25 mg/kg) which may
be necessary to reveal immune-independent mechanisms. in the current study, sub-optimal drug doses were
used that do not result in complete tumor inhibition but
may unmask previously unappreciated immune-dependent mechanisms. furthermore, both cox-dependent
and cox-independent eﬀects of cox inhibitors have
been described. it will be interesting to determine if
cox-independent therapeutic eﬀects are also independent of immune eﬀector mechansisms.
recently, the mechanisms by which nk cells recognize
and kill tumor targets have been clariﬁed [24]. through a
repertoire of receptors, nk cells receive both stimulatory
and inhibitory signals from ligands expressed on the potential target cell. inhibitory signals are mediated by
binding of mhc molecules, expressed on the target cell, to
cognate inhibitory receptors on the nk eﬀector cells. the
current data reports the novel ﬁnding that two cox
inhibitors downregulate expression of mhc class i molecules (ld and kd) on tumor cells. the reversal of the
mhc class i downregulation by exogenous pge2 indicates that the eﬀect of cox inhibitors on class i is
cox-dependent. decreased mhc class i expression is
associated with increased nk-mediated lysis. these data
suggest an additional mechanism whereby cox inhibitors can enhance nk-mediated lysis. by decreasing the
expression of inhibitory signals mediated by mhc class i,
nk cells are activated to lyse tumor cell targets. this study
also shows that ifn-c is critical to controlling metastasis
by cox inhibitors. ifn-c modulates many functions
including nk activities. consistent with our ﬁndings, a
recent report shows that pge2 suppresses ifn-c synthesis by nk cells [29]. the ﬁnding that ifn- c can upregulate mhc class i appears to conﬂict with the mechanism
of nk activation proposed in this study. although further
studies will be required to resolve this issue, it is possible
that the role of ifn-c is context-dependent. thus, ifn-c
may be required at the site of nk activation in peripheral
sites, but does not aﬀect mhc expression at the tumor
site. our studies and earlier work from other laboratories
[4, 15] implicate nk cells as important targets of cox
therapy. there is increasing evidence that dendritic cells
are also important targets of pge2-mediated immune
suppression [5, 20, 23, 30]. those ﬁndings have obvious
implications for the induction of tumor-speciﬁc t cellmediated immunologic responses. thus, tumor-pge2 has
eﬀects on both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune
responses.
these ﬁndings add to the growing body of evidence
that coxibs have therapeutic activity in models of human
cancer. they expand our knowledge by showing that, in
addition to direct eﬀects of coxibs on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and indirect eﬀects on tumor
angiogenesis, coxibs also modulate protective antitumor
immune eﬀector functions leading to control of tumor
growth and metastasis. further elucidation of the relevant mechanisms will be important in the design of
combination therapies employing immune-based and
cox-targeted strategies.
