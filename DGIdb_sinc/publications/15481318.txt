treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum
with infliximab in crohn’s disease
mark s. sapienza, md, sidney cohen, md, and anthony j. dimarino, md

pyoderma gangrenosum (pg) is an ulcerating noninfectious disease of the skin seen in 1 to 5% of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease. the pathogenesis of pg has yet to be determined but may
be related to abnormal t cell responses and the production of tnf-alpha, a powerful proinflammatory
cytokine. infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tnf-alpha, has been approved for the treatment
of crohn’s disease. we present four patients with pg treated with infliximab for fistulizing crohn’s
in whom complete healing of pg was achieved. four patients with active fistulizing crohn’s disease
and pg were treated. all patients were females ranging in age from 48 to 60 years, with a mean
age of 54 years. three of four patients had pg lesions located on the lower extremities; one patient
had peristomal disease. all patients had at least colonic involvement of their crohn’s. the patients
received either a single infusion or a series of three 5 mg/kg infliximab infusions. all four patients
demonstrated rapid healing of pg within 4 weeks of the first infusion of infliximab. pg healing
followed improvement in bowel disease. complete resolution without recurrence was noted in all
patients. rapid resolution of pg was noted in four female patients with fistulizing crohn’s disease
treated with infliximab. healing was complete, without recurrence. the anti-tnf-alpha properties of
infliximab suggest that healing may be mediated by the drug’s effect on cytokine pathways, perhaps
by blunted t cell activation early in the inflammatory cascade. we suggest an independent effect of
infliximab on pg.

pyoderma gangrenosum (pg) is an ulcerating noninfectious disease of the skin seen in 1 to 5% of patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). originally described
as more common in ulcerative colitis than in crohn’s disease, the incidences are now equal. approximately onethird of patients with pg will have underlying ibd but the
disease can be associated with other systemic illnesses
(1, 2).
brunsting et al. first reported five cases with small,
discrete pustules that evolved into ulcerating lesions (3).

of erythema and eventually necrose and ulcerate, forming a characteristic violaceous border. the ulcers may
contain fistulous tracts and necrotic debris and are often
exquisitely tender.
pyoderma can involve any part of the skin but usually
affects the lower extremities with either single or multiple
lesions that can involve an entire limb. the disease shares
with behcet’s syndrome the property of pathergy, which
is the advancement or development of new ulcerations at
sites of mild trauma. the ulcers may eventually heal with a
characteristic appearance described as cribiform scarring
(1, 4).
effective therapy has been achieved by treating the underlying illness and providing aggressive local care. in the
following series of four patients with fistulizing crohn’s
disease the response of pg to treatment with infliximab is
reported.

results
the clinical characteristics of these four female patients
are listed in table 1. all patients had fistulizing crohn’s
disease with varying stages of activity as evidenced by
the crohn’s disease activity index (cdai) (5). with the
exception of patient 1, the index patient, all the patients
had relatively mild crohn’s disease. all patients showed
dramatic improvement after one infusion of infliximab
(5 mg/kg).
table 2 lists the response to treatment and any additional treatments patients were already receiving. patient
1 had the most active disease and required two additional
infliximab infusions. all pg lesions eventually healed
completely.
the photographs in figure 1 represent the various pg
lesions in the patient with the most severe involvement
(no. 1). the pg lesions involved the extremities, the
perianal region, and the abdomen. all pg sites healed
completely.
discussion
the present report describes marked improvement of
pg in four female patients with crohn’s disease.
the name, pyoderma gangrenosum, reflects the historical view of this disease as an infectious process but the
characteristic pustular lesions are essentially sterile. the
histopathologic findings in cases of ulcerative pg reveal
a central neutrophilic infiltrate with a predominance of
lymphocytes extending toward the periphery of the ulcers. recent attention has focused on the role of abnormal
t cell responses and abnormal “neutrophil trafficking”
(1, 6, 7).
the etiology of the disease remains to be elucidated.
the disease is rare, with 180 reported cases diagnosed in

a 53-year period at the mayo clinic (8). the incidence may
be increasing due to increased awareness and the wide use
of immunosuppresion. pg tends to occur with a slightly
greater propensity in women as shown in this report and
usually involves adults, with a peak incidence from 20 to
49 years.
though any part of the skin can be involved, the lower
extremities, and sometimes an entire limb, are usually involved. the diagnosis is made clinically and should be
one of exclusion. the lesions are often mistaken as infections but do not heal with antibiotics (9–13). peristomal
pg is a rare variant in patients with ibd who have a stoma
(14, 15).
the treatment of pg involves management of the underlying systemic illness. the mainstay of therapy has
been corticosteroids. dapsone has been used as a steroid
sparing drug. topical treatments with corticosteroids may
be effective in localized disease. other agents reported to
have limited success are topical disodium  xxxd1763xxx ,
 xxxd1665xxx , and  xxxd2375xxx  (16).
improvement has also been noted after proctocolectomy in cases of ulcerative colitis (17), but the disease
may recur after surgery. cyclosporine may be effective
in severe cases but its systemic use is limited by nephrotoxicity. cyclosporine has also been used topically or injected into the lesions (18, 19). intralesional injections
have been discouraged because of severe pain. thalidomide has also emerged as a treatment option. thalidomide
has been shown to inhibit tnf-alpha production and chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells (20–23).
tnf-alpha functions as a proinflammatory cytokine. it
functions early in the inflammatory cascade and is released by macrophages, monocytes, and activated t cells.
its function in patients with ibd, particularly crohn’s disease, has been demonstrated in numerous animal models,

fig 1. response of pyoderma gangrenosum in patient 1 after three infusions of infliximab. infliximab (5 mg/kg) was infused at time 0, 2 weeks,
and 6 weeks. photos show pretreatment, 2 weeks after the first infusion, 4 weeks after the second infusion, and 12 weeks after the third infusion.
all lesions showed a rapid response, with healing and reepitheliazation.

in which tnf-alpha mrna has been shown to be upregulated in bowel mucosa with colitis. furthermore, tnf-alpha
knockout mice that do not produce tnf-alpha have histologic
improvement in their bowel mucosa.
in recent years, infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tnf-alpha, has been used in crohn’s disease. the antibody targets tnf-alpha, neutralizes it with a high specificity,
and results in decreased tissue inflammation. crohn’s patients treated with anti-tnf-alpha exhibited sequential downregulation of tnf-alpha and  xxxg1141xxx  in tissue mucosa
(24, 25).
this report demonstrates, a dramatic response of pg
lesions of four patients with crohn’s disease when treated
with infliximab. to date no published study has looked at
the role of infliximab in the treatment of pg. it is possible
that the rapid response to infliximab in these patients is
the result of blunted t cell activation early in the inflammatory cascade. this may lead to a decrease in neutrophil
infiltration and tissue destruction. though it is possible to
implicate corticosteroids in the response of some of these

1456

patients, the rapidity of the response was felt to be too dramatic to account for it alone. though the response with
infliximab was dramatic, it is not known if the response is
from a direct effect of the drug on pg or if it is secondary
to the treatment of the underlying crohn’s disease.
the four patients in the current report show considerable similarity. all patients were women with chronic
fistulizing crohn’s disease. the pg was heterogeneous in
that it varied in location and severity. in all cases the healing was rapid and complete with infliximab. dramatic improvement or full resolution was seen with one treatment.
in short-term follow-up, recurrences have not been noted.
it is premature to recommend infliximab as the primary
therapy in pg in association with crohn’s disease. more
experience is required to judge therapeutic options. failure
to heal and recurrence rates need to be noted. the sporadic,
heterogeneous character and possibility of extension of
disease make placebo-controlled trials unlikely. this is
especially so with other effective therapies available such
as corticosteroids.

treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with infliximab

the similarities in the bowel and skin in response to infliximab may be a clue to common pathogenetic processes.
presently our understanding of the relationship between
ibd and its extraintestinal manifestations is unknown.
pg seen with other conditions such as lymphoproliferative diseases, sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus,
and chronic active hepatitis, pg in patients receiving immunosuppression, and the idiopathic variety may respond
differently (26). infliximab was effective only in those patients with underlying crohn’s disease as illustrated in this
report. pg seen in these other conditions may be bullous
or vegetative, involving the upper extremities, and may be
quite distinct from the ulcerative or pustular forms seen in
crohn’s disease.
