mechanism of the haemostatic
effect of  xxxd2050xxx  in
the injection sclerotherapy for
oesophageai varices
changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis were investigated in 20 patients
with oesophageal varices, who underwent endoscopic injection
sclerotherapy ( e i s ) with 5 per cent  xxxd2050xxx  (eo),by means of
serial determination of plasmafibrinopeptide a ( f p a )andfibrinopeptide
bp15-42 (bp15-42). one hour after the completion of eis, the value of
f p a was significantly increased to 38.1 f11.1,ngfml (mean ks.e.m.)
from a pre-els value of 7.1+1*4 nglml (p<o.oi) and it gradually
returned to normal range by 48 h after eis. a very similar change was
observed in the value of bp15-42 ( p < 0.01). these observations indicated
that eis provokes transient activation of coagulation andfibrinolysis. in
vitro studies, however, revealed that eo inhibits fibrin clot formation
because of the ca2+-chelating ability of its constituent ethanolamine,
although  xxxd2777xxx  or benzyl alcohol exhibited procoagulant activity in f p a
formation in vitro. nevertheless, ah external application of eo or  xxxd2777xxx 
over decapsulized kidney of rat resulted in a signijicant accumulation of
251-labelled jibrin( xxxd2046xxx ). from these results it was suggested that
intravascular injection of e o , which exerts an inhibitory e f j c t on
coagulation in vitro, activates the local coagulation system. the
activation may be accelerated by an acute inflammatory process provoked
by  xxxd2777xxx , which is supported by such clinical manifestations as mild fever,
retrosternal pain leukocytosis and an increase in plasma fibrinogen level
which was observed in all during the period.

since crafoord and frenckner' first reported endoscopic
injection sclerotherapy (eis) for oesophageal varices in 1939,
this technique has been advocated with excellent results' - * in
many countries. the haemostatic effect of this method has been
thought to be due to thrombi formation in addition to tissue
necrosis and inflammation6,'. nevertheless, the precise
mechanism of the haemostatic effect of eis has not yet been fully
elucidated, although the formation of thrombi in the very early
stage after the injection has been documented in autopsy
studies6*'.
in our institution, eis with 5 per cent  xxxd2050xxx 
(eo) has been successfully performed to control rebleeding from
oesophageal varices,
without
knowing the
exact
pharmacological action of the sclerosant. therefore, the present
clinical and experimental studies were conducted to elucidate
the mechanism of the haemostatic effect of eo used in eis.

half an hour before the procedure. eis was performed without tracheal
intubation except in one patient who showed a marked pharyngeal
reflex. a sengstaken-blakemore (s-b) tube was gently introduced
before the endoscopic examination to evacuate gastric contents and to
control variceal flow from the stomach. the endoscope used was
olympus b-3 (tokyo, japan) attached with a balloon for proximal
compressiod a 20g disposable flexible needle was used for the
injection. the sclerosant eo was composed of  xxxd2777xxx  (4.23g),
ethanolamine (0.91 g) and benzyl alcohol (2 per cent) in 100 ml distilled
water; an average of 19.4ml was injected per case ranging from 10 to
27 ml. just before the injection, the distal and proximal venous flow was
controlled by inflating the s-b balloon and the balloon attached to the
fibrescope. the sclerosant was injected into varices just above the
oesophagogastric junction'.

procedure of eis
all patients were given by intramuscular injection  xxxd247xxx 
(0.5 mg), hyoscine hydrobromide (20 mg) and pentazocine (30 mg)

determination of  xxxg784xxx  (fpa) and fibrinopeptide bp15-42
(bbzs-42)
venous blood was collected by the two syringe technique into a 5 ml
plastic syringe containing one tenth volume of 0.15 m nacl solution
containing 1000units/ml heparin and lo00 units/ml aprotinin. then the
plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 20009 (4"c, 15 min). the
plasma was defibrinated by ethanol (50 per cent, final concentration)
and then diluted five-fold with 0.05 m  xxxd3449xxx  (containing 0.1 m naci,
0.01 m edta, 0.1 per cent sodium azide, ph 7.8) to reduce the
concentration of ethanol. the diluted plasma was subjected to
radioimmunoassay of fpa and bb15-42. the radioimmunoassay of
fpa and bb15-42 was performed basically according to the method of
nossel and youngerg.'' and kudryk and blomback" with some
modifications. a rapid separation of free antigen from antibody bound
antigen was performed by the two antibody method, using
polyethyleneglycol'2. standard peptides and antiserum were obtained
from imco, sweden. goat anti-rabbit antiserum was obtained from
eiken co., japan. labelling of fpa and bb15-42 with na'"i
(amersham, japan) was carried out by the chloramine t method' '.
the values of fpa and bb15-42 thus obtained in healthy subjects

patients and methods
patients
serial studies were conducted in 20 consecutive patients with
oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis, who were admitted to the
second department of surgery, osaka university hospital in 1984 and
1985. there were 16 men and 4 women in the series and mean age was
50.5 & 6.4 years (mean f s.d.) ranging from 41 to 62 years old. fourteen
patients were child's grade a, five were grade b and one was grade c. all
patients suffered from at least one episode of bleeding due to ruptured
varices. of 20 patients, 17 received eis for the first time and the rest for
the second time.

were 4.0 k2.1 and 3.0 k2.1 ng/ml, respectively (mean s.d., n = 50). in 20
cases of the present study, serial sampling was performed before and 1
hour, i, 2, and 3 days after eis.
other laboratory tests
other laboratory tests such as prothrombin time (pt, per cent),
activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), normotest@(nyegaard,
norway), plasma fibrinogen, fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ) degradation products (fdp)
and complete blood cell count were performed in the central
laboratory of the university hospital. the above coagulation tests
were determined by an automated coagulometer using commercially
available reagents. plasma fibrinogen was determined by thrombin
clotting time. fdp was measured semiquantitatively by latex particle
aggregation. normal ranges are as follows: pt, 80-120 (per cent);
aptt, 20 35 (s); antithrombin-111, 80 120 (per cent); normotest@,
70- 150 (per cent); fibrinogen, 150- 350 (mg/dl).

in vitro study on eo and its constituents
the effect of eo and its constituents on blood coagulation was studied
by means of recalcification clotting time (rct) and fpa formation.
rct was performed using either fresh citrated whole blood or pooled
plasma as substrates. the clotting end point of whole blood rct and
plasma rct was recorded by the manual hook method and automated
clotek@system (hyland, usa), respectively. for determination of fpa
formed in vitro, 250 pl fresh citrated blood was incubated with 50 pi eo
or its constituent in a siliconized glass tube at 37Â°c for 1 min and the
reaction was started by addition of 100 pl 15 mm caci,. at designated
times, the reaction was terminated by addition of 100 p1 100mm edta
and 500 pl of chilled ethanol. and the supernatant of the mixture was
subjected to the radioimmunoassay as described above.

changes in other laboratory tests following e i s

as shown in figure 2, the prothrombin value was significantly
decreased (p<oo5) from the pre-eis value of 59.3k3.0 to
51.9 & 2.4 per cent at one day after eis, there was a downward
trend in the value of antithrombin 111 and normotest@at one
day after eis but the differences were not statistically significant.
no changes were observed in the value of aptt, fdp and
count of erythrocytes, platelets. significant leukocytosis was
noted at day 1 and 2 after eis. the plasma fibrinogen level
gradually increased to 307.9 22.6 mg/dl at day 3 from pre-eis
values of 252.5 & 18.3 mg/dl.

animal experiments
the following animal experiment was conducted by modifying a
previously reported methcd14. after anaesthetizing a male wistar rat, a
jugular vein was cannulated and both kidneys were exposed without
compromising blood flow. then a small calibre gamma detector was
placed on a sheet of gauze covering decapsulized kidney. '251-labelled
fibrinogen (8 pci, green cross co., japan) was injected through the
catheter along with 200 mg/kg of trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid ( xxxd3410xxx ), which was given to prevent the activation
of fibrinolysis. the accumulation of radioactivity in each kidney
was continuously monitored after eo or its constituents were applied to
the kidney by soaking into the gauze.

and recalcification time was measured. the results are
summarized in table 1.addition of eo or ethanolamine alone to
the citrated whole blood resulted in significant prolongation of
the clotting time, while addition of  xxxd2777xxx  or benzyl alcohol alone
to whole blood or plasma resulted in slight shortening of the
clotting time. a more marked anticoagulant effect of eo or
ethanolamine was observed when it was added to plasma, as the
degree of coagulation process by recalcification was more
marked in whole blood than in plasma due to the well-known
cell-surface mediated acceleration of coagulation.
effect of eo and its constituents on in vitro formation of f p a

to investigate further the effect of e o on coagulation, the effect
of eo and its constituents on in uitro fpa formation was
determined. as in figure 3a fpa formation of citrated whole
blood upon addition of cac1, was inhibited markedly by
ethanolamine, but was accelerated in the presence of  xxxd2777xxx  or
benzyl alcohol. the amount of fpa formed in citrated whole
blood by addition of the varied amount of cac1, was studied in
the presence or absence of ethanolamine. as shown in figure 3b,
the inhibitory effect was overcome by increasing the amount of
 xxxg2125xxx ,, suggesting possible chelation of ca2 by ethanolamine.

an external application of e o to the decapsulized kidney
resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of '"i
radioactivity. a typical recording of ''1 radioactivity is
shown in figure 4. ninety minutes after the infusion of 1251labelled fibrinogen, both kidneys were harvested under
perfusion with saline containing heparin and the radioactivity in
each kidney was determined by y-counter. the radioactivity of
the kidney treated by eo was 144 f38 per cent (mean s.d.,
n = s), 100 per cent being that in control kidney. the difference
was statistically significant ( p <0.05).the similar increase in the
radioactivity was observed in the kidney treated by  xxxd2777xxx  alone,
while no such effect was obtained when it was treated by
ethanolamine alone.

to investigate the systemic effect of the injected sclerosant on
coagulation and fibrinolysis, we have utilized ria
determination of two fibrinopeptides, fpa and bp15-42.the
former is liberated from fibrinogen by the action of t h r ~ m b i n ' , ' ~
and the latter by the action of plasmin". as the direct
measurement of thrombin or plasmin formed in uiuo has been
found to be impossible due to enzyme-inhibitor complex
formation, the measurement of the fibrinopeptides is the only
sensitive method available at present for the detection of in uiuo
activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. the conventional
coagulation time was not sensitive enough to detect mild
hypercoagulability, nor f d p is sensitive to detect fibrinolysis.
in our 20 cases of eis, there were slight changes in the value
of pt, normotest@and at-i11 after eis. as pre-eis values of
these tests were already abnormal due to liver cirrhosis, it would
be difficult to draw any conclusion by the above findings on
possible activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis by eis.
however, employing the radioimmunoassay of fibrinopeptides,
it was possible to demonstrate clearly the transient activation of
coagulation and fibrinolysis after eis. it was speculated that two
possible mechanisms might be involved in the activation by eis,
one is the direct activation of coagulation by e o and another is
the activation secondary to inflammatory reaction by the
s ~ l e r o s a n t ~ ~the
~ ' ~ .latter possibility is supported by
leukocytosis, mild fever, retrosternal pain and increased
fibrinogen as acute phase protein. then, we proceeded to
determine the direct effect of e o and its constituents on
coagulation. it was a great surprise to observe that eo prolongs
clotting time and inhibits in uitro fpa formation.
more detailed studies using respective constituents, however,
revealed that the anticoagulant effect of e o was due to the
presence of ethanolamine, which chelates ca2 necessary for
coagulation. ethanolamine has been used as a solubilizer of
 xxxd2777xxx  in this particular sclerosant and its anticoagulant effect by
chelation has never been reported until now. however,  xxxd2777xxx

promoted in uitro formation of fpa, and it thereby might
activate the coagulation directly in uiuo, if ethanolamine was
absorbed in tissue'
attempts were made to simulate the effect of eis in uiuo by
applying eo or  xxxd2777xxx  directly to decapsulized kidney, where
continuous monitoring of the radioactivity of '251-labelled
fibrinogen was performed as reported previously. it was difficult
to quantify the result, but application of eo or  xxxd2777xxx  triggered
the accumulation of the radioactivity.
these observations suggest that the sclerosant may directly
activate coagulation in uiuo, although there was no doubt about
occurrence of the local inflammatory reaction, which in part
contributed to clot formation by the activation of hageman
factor as well as of release of tissue factorlg. it may not be
appropriate to draw any conclusion as to which mechanism
primarily accounted for the proved haemostatic effect of eis but
it is apparent that activation of coagulation takes place
immediately after eis, followed by the gradual inflammatory
response as shown in the present study by transient elevation of
fpa and gradual increase of fibrinogen as the marker of
inflammation.
