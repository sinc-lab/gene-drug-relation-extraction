dose-dependent inhibition of platelet  xxxg1883xxx  and monocyte  xxxg1884xxx  by  xxxd2561xxx  in healthy subjects.  we evaluated whether therapeutic blood levels of  xxxd2561xxx  are associated with selective inhibition of monocyte cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 in vitro and ex vivo. concentration-response curves for the inhibition of monocyte cox-2 and platelet cox-1 were obtained in vitro after the incubation of  xxxd2561xxx  with whole blood samples. moreover, 11 healthy volunteers received placebo or 7.5 or 15 mg/day  xxxd2561xxx , each treatment for 7 consecutive days, according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. before dosing and 24 h after the seventh dose of each regimen, heparinized whole blood samples were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (10 microgram/ml) for 24 h at 37 degrees c, and  xxxd1903xxx  was measured in plasma as an index of monocyte cox-2 activity. the production of thromboxane b2 in whole blood allowed to clot at 37 degrees c for 60 min was assessed as an index of platelet cox-1 activity. the administration of placebo did not significantly affect plasma  xxxd1903xxx  (21. 3 +/- 7.5 versus 19.1 +/- 4 ng/ml, mean +/- s.d., n = 11) or serum thromboxane b2 (426 +/- 167 versus 425 +/- 150 ng/ml) levels. in contrast, the administration of 7.5 and 15 mg of  xxxd2561xxx  caused dose-dependent reductions in monocyte cox-2 activity by 51% and 70%, respectively, and in platelet cox-1 activity by 25% and 35%, respectively. although the ic50 value of  xxxd2561xxx  for inhibition of cox-1 was 10-fold higher than the ic50 value of cox-2 in vitro, this biochemical selectivity was inadequate to clearly separate the effects of  xxxd2561xxx  on the two isozymes after oral dosing as a function of the daily dose and interindividual variation in steady-state plasma levels.
