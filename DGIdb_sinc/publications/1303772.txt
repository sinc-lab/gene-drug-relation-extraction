[effect of loratadine--selective antagonist of histamine (h1) receptor--on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in atopic asthmatics].  the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of loratadine on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction. the study was performed in 7 asthmatic patients with sensitivity to dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 4 women and 3 men. aged from 19 to 37 years. the allergen inhalatory--challenge test was performed according to chai et al. early phase of dermatophagoides pteronyssinus--induced bronchoconstriction appeared in all examined patients, but late phase of bronchial obstruction was observed only in 3 persons. 30 mg orally administered of loratadine have no protect effect on early phase of allergen--induced bronchoconstriction. after loratadine ingestion the late phase of this bronchial obstruction disappeared.
