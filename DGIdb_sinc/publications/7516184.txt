abstract:  xxxg2297xxx  is a secreted 35-kda glycoprotein, inducible by tnf and il-1. the n-terminal portion
of  xxxg2297xxx  shows sequence homology to members of the  xxxg1018xxx  family of hyaluronan binding
proteins. the c-terminal half of  xxxg2297xxx  contains a so-called c u b domain, characteristic for developmentally
regulated proteins. high levels of  xxxg2297xxx  protein are found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and some other arthritic diseases. here we show that  xxxg2297xxx  readily formed a complex with a
protein present in human, bovine, rabbit, and mouse serum. this complex was stable during sds-page
under reducing conditions, and in the presence of 8 m urea. the protein that binds  xxxg2297xxx  was purified
from human serum and identified as inter-a-inhibitor (iai)by n-terminal microsequencing. microsequencing
of the complex itself revealed the presence of  xxxg2297xxx  and two of the three polypeptide chains of iai ( xxxg151xxx 
and  xxxg2057xxx ). experiments with recombinant  xxxg2297xxx  and iai purified from human serum showed that the
 xxxg2297xxx /iai complex is rapidly formed even in the apparent absence of other proteins at 37 "c, but not a t
4 oc. the t s g - 6 i i a i complex was cleaved by  xxxd1687xxx  abc lyase, suggesting that cross-linking
by  xxxd1687xxx  is required for the stability of the complex. although the functional consequences
of t s g - 6 / i a i complex formation are presently unknown, the fact that  xxxg2297xxx  forms similar complexes with
i a i from several animal species indicates that the components involved in this interaction are conserved
in evolution.

 xxxg2297xxx  (tnf-stimulated gene 6) codes for a secretory 35kda glycoprotein that is a member of the hyaladherin family
of hyaluronan binding proteins (lee et al., 1992;toole, 1991).
 xxxg2297xxx  was originally discovered by differential screening of
a cdna library from tnf-stimulated human diploid fibroblasts (lee et al., 1990). sequencing of the cdna revealed
an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 277 amino
acids including a cleavable signal peptide (lee et al., 1992).
in its n-terminal half, the predicted amino acid sequence
shows 3 6 4 0 % homology to members of the hyaladherin family
of proteins that includes the lymphocyte homing/hyaluronan
receptor cd44,  xxxg1018xxx , and the proteoglycan
core proteins  xxxg33xxx  and  xxxg2407xxx  (lee et al., 1992). the
c-terminal half of  xxxg2297xxx  shares 30% sequence homology
with the a chain of complement component c l r . this
homology region forms a so-called cub domain which is a
motif found in proteins involved in developmental processes
(bork & beckmann, 1993). two n-glycosylation consensus
sequences are present in  xxxg2297xxx , and the presence of n-linked
carbohydrate was experimentally confirmed (lee et al., 1992).
like other hyaladherins,  xxxg2297xxx  protein binds specifically to
hyaluronan.  xxxg2297xxx  expression is tightly regulated, with its
transcription in fibroblasts rapidly activated by stimulation
with the proinflammatory cytokines il-1 or  xxxg2296xxx  (lee et
al., 1990, 1993). high levels of  xxxg2297xxx  protein were found
in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and

some other forms of arthritis, whereas no  xxxg2297xxx  protein was
detected in synovial fluids from normal human joints (wisniewski et al., 1993). in addition, synovipcytes from the joints
of rheumatoid arthritis patients showed constitutive  xxxg2297xxx 
expression that was further upregulated by il-1 and tnf,
cytokines that are regularly found in the rheumatoid synovial
fluid and tissue (wisniewski et al., 1993).
western blot analysis with antibodies to  xxxg2297xxx  protein
revealed,in addition to the 35-kda band, an unexpected second
band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 120
kda (lee et al., 1992; wisniewski et al., 1992, 1993). (this
second band characteristically appeared as a doublet, with a
major component of 120kda and a less regularly detectable
130-kda component.) although the nature of what appeared
to be a high molecular weight form of  xxxg2297xxx  protein was not
understood, we noted that this form was regularly detected
by western blots in supernatants from tsg-producingcultures
maintained in serum-containing medium, but not in serumfree medium. this observation led to the notion that the 120kda band may represent a stable complex of  xxxg2297xxx  with a
serum protein (wisniewski et al., 1992, 1993). the presence
of the 120-kda band was also demonstrated in synovial fluids
from arthritis patients (wisniewski et al., 1993).
inter-a-inhibitor ( i d ) ' is a member of a family of closely
related serum proteins with  xxxg745xxx  inhibitory activity,
consisting of iai, pre-a-inhibitor (pai), and inter-a-like
inhibitor (iali) (enghild et al., 1989; gebhard et al., 1990;
rouet et al., 1992). the protease inhibitory activity of these
proteins resides exclusively in a polypeptide chain termed

 xxxg151xxx  (gebhard et al., 1989, 1990) that is shared by all
members of this family. the different proteins are formed by
the linkage of  xxxg151xxx  to one or two of three heavy chains
(hc1,  xxxg2057xxx , hc3) which show 38-54s amino acid sequence
homology to each other (bourguignon et al., 1993). iai
consists of  xxxg151xxx  linked to both hc1 and  xxxg2057xxx ,  xxxd2211xxx  consists
of  xxxg151xxx  linked to hc3, and iali is a complex of  xxxg151xxx 
with  xxxg2057xxx  (enghild et al., 1989; gebhard et al., 1990; rouet
et al., 1992). a chondroitin 4-sulfate chain whose reducing
end is linked to serlo of  xxxg151xxx  (enghild et al., 1991; chirat
et al., 1991) cross-linksthe polypeptide chains of thesecomplex
protein molecules, which are all stable in sds-page under
reducing conditions. here we show that the earlier recognized
120-kda complex reactive with antibodies to  xxxg2297xxx  protein
(lee et al., 1992; wisniewski et al., 1992, 1993) consists of
 xxxg2297xxx  and components of iai, cross-linked by a glycosaminoglycan chain.
experimental procedures
materials. chrondroitin sulfate abc lyase from proteus
vulgaris (ec 4.2.2.4) and  xxxd2289xxx  lyase from streptomyces hyalurolyticus (ec 4.2.2.1) were purchased from
sigma, rabbit anti-human i a i immunoglobulin was from dako
(glostrup, denmark), and [ys]methionine/ [%]cysteine
(tran3wabel)was purchased from icn. immunoprecipitin
(sac) was from gibco brl, and ex-cell 300 and excell 400 medium was from j r h biosciences (lenexa, ks).
albumin removal affini-filters were from affinity technology, new brunswick, nj, centricon-10 concentrators were
from amicon, and pvdf membranes (immobilon-p) were
from millipore. fplc equipment and separation matrices
were from pharmacia. all other chemicals were purchased
from commercial suppliers and were of analytical or molecular
biology grade.
production and purification of recombinant human
 xxxg2297xxx  protein. recombinant autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus (genus baculovirus) containing human
 xxxg2297xxx  cdna (wisniewski et al., 1992) was used for the
infection of  xxxd102xxx  insect cells from trichoplusia ni (btitn-5b1-4; purchased from invitrogen, san diego, ca). for
high-level expression and purification of  xxxg2297xxx  protein, tn5b insect cells were grown in serum-free ex-cell 400
medium. the cell culture medium was replaced 24 h after
inoculation of -70-80771 confluent cultures with recombinant
virus and collected again 48 h later. for purification of  xxxg2297xxx 
protein, cleared culture supernatant was directly loaded on a
monos (hr5/5) column equilibrated with 20 mm mes, ph
6.5. bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient (20 ml)
from 0 to 1 m nacl in 20 mm mes, ph 6.5. fractions
containing the bulk of  xxxg2297xxx  protein (0.45-0.65 m nacl)
were pooled, concentrated in centricon- 10 units, and applied
onto a superdex 75 (hr10/30) column equilibrated with 20
mm mes, ph 6.5,0.5 m  xxxg2020xxx . this resulted in the recovery
of 195% pure  xxxg2297xxx  protein as judged by silver staining of
sds-page gels. about 1 pg of pure protein was recovered
per 1 ml of culture supernatant. microsequencing of the
purified  xxxg2297xxx  protein established trpl* as the n-terminus
of the mature secreted glycoprotein (data not shown and table
2), which is in good agreement with the predicted cleavage
site of the signal peptide sequence (von heijne, 1984, 1985).
analysis of t s g - 6 binding to carrier protein. to
determine the presence of  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein, samples to
be analyzed were mixed with an equal volume of tsg-6containing serum-free supernatants of tn-5b insect cells
infected with recombinant baculovirus and incubated at 37

wisniewski et al.
oc for 30-60 min. (purified  xxxg2297xxx  protein was used in some
experiments, as indicated.) thereafter, the mixtures were
analyzed for the presence of the 120-kda complex by western
blotting with purified rabbit antibody to  xxxg2297xxx  as described
earlier (wisniewski et al., 1993). for detectionof iai epitopes
by western blotting, membranes were incubated with a rabbit
anti-human iai antibody (dako) at a 1:2000 dilution for 1
h.
immunoprecipitation. human hepg2 hepatoma cells
producing i a i constitutively (bourguignon et al., 1989) were
grown in serum-free ex-cell 300 medium. [3ss]methionine (tran3%-1abel) was added to about 75% confluent hepg2
cell cultures in a 25 cm2 flask (500 pci/culture), and the
culture supernatant was collected after 24 h. the 35s-labeled
hepg2 culture supernatant (300 pl) was incubated with 16
pg of purified recombinant  xxxg2297xxx  protein or with buffer for
1 h at 37 oc. samples were precleared with 150 pl of 10%
sac (heat-killed, formalin-fixed staphylococcus aureus).
rabbit anti- xxxg2297xxx  antiserum or preimmune serum from the
same rabbit (5 pl) was added to the supernatants and
incubated for 3 h at 37 oc. thereafter, 150 pl of 10% sac
was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed
3 times with 1 ml of 20 mm tris, ph 7.5,0.5 m nacl, 0.02%
tween-20. pellets were resuspended in 40 pl of sds-page
sample buffer (reducing) and incubated for 3 min in a boiling
water bath. the supernatants were removed and analyzed by
sds-page on 10% paa gels and fluorography.
partial purification of the  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein from
human serum for n - terminal microsequencing. protein
precipitated between 40% and 55% saturation with ammonium
sulfate from 40 ml of fresh human serum was dissolved in
10 ml of pbs and dialyzed against 50 mm kh2po4, ph 7.0,
50 mm  xxxg2020xxx . four aliquots were passed through affinifilter cartridges for albumin removal (affinity technology).
each cartridge was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer and
eluted with 5 ml of 50 mm kh2p04, ph 7.0, 0.5m nacl.
the eluates of four cartridges were pooled, dialyzed against
20 mm tris, ph 7.5,50 mm  xxxg2020xxx , and loaded on a monoq
column (hr5/5, pharmacia) using a pharmacia fplc
system. protein was eluted with a linear gradient (16 ml)
from 50 mm to 1 m nacl in 50 mm tris, ph 7.5. fractions
containing  xxxg2297xxx  binding activity were pooled and concentrated in centricon-10 units to a final volume of 200 r l . this
material was further separated by fplc on a superdex 200
column (hr10/30). the column was equilibrated with 50
mm na2hp04, ph 7.0,150 mm nacl and run at a flow rate
of 0.5ml/min. fractions containing  xxxg2297xxx  binding activity
were pooled and concentrated in centricon- 10 units. the
material was further separated by sds-page under reducing
conditions on a 4-1 5% paa gel and transferred in methanolfree transfer buffer at 200 ma for 1 h to a pvdf membrane.
staining with coomassie blue r250 revealed only one protein
band greater than 200 kda which was used for microsequencing.
purification of iaifrom human serum. i a i was purified
from human serum according to salier et al. (1980), with
some modifications. fplc on q sepharose fast flow was
used instead of deae-sephacel chromatography. chelating
sepharose fast flow was used for zinc chelate chromatography. phenyl superose was used for hydrophobic chromatography, and superdex 200 was used for size-exclusion
chromatography instead of sephacryl-300. the iairecovered
was essentially pure as judged by sds-page and silver
staining.

results
binding of  xxxg2297xxx  protein to a prorein present in mammalionsera andinsupernaronts ofhuman hepg2 heparoma
cells. western blot analysis of serum-free culture supernatants of tn-5b insect cells infected with recombinant
baculouirus encoding human  xxxg2297xxx  revealed the presence of
a 32-kda band reactive with antibody to  xxxg2297xxx  (figure i ,
lane 1). recombinant human  xxxg2297xxx  protein produced in
insect cells migratessomewhat faster than the35-kdatsg-6
protein from human cells (wisniewski et al., 1993; data not
shown) possibly due to a different extent of glycosylation. a
second band recognized by antibody against  xxxg2297xxx , with the
apparent molecular mass of 29 kda, probably represents
unglycosylated  xxxg2297xxx  protein. when  xxxg2297xxx -containing
culture supernatants were incubated at 37 "c in the presence
offetal bovineserum (lane3),mouseserum (lane7),orserumfree culture supernatant of human hepgz hepatoma cells

complex of  xxxg2297xxx  with a distinct protein, and not a  xxxg2297xxx 
oligomer whose formation is promoted by serum, weemployed
immunoprecipitation. when a supernatant from hepg2 cells
cultured in serum-free medium in the presence of ['?simethionine wasincubated with unlabeled purified recombinant
 xxxg2297xxx  protein and immunoprecipitated with a rabbit antiserum totsg-6, a labeled 120-kda molecule was precipitated
(figure 2). this immunoprecipitation was specific because
incubation with preimmune serum from the same rabbit or
incubation of 3ss-labeledhepg2 supernatants with immune
serum in the absence of  xxxg2297xxx  protein failed to precipitate
a labeled 120-kda molecule. ["simethionine incorporation
into a molecule specifically recognized by an antibody totsg-6
indicates that the 120-kda molecule is indeed a complex of
 xxxg2297xxx  protein with another distinct protein that is constitutively produced and secreted by human hepgz cells.
partial purification and fdenrification of the  xxxg2297xxx 
bindingproteinfrom humanserum. fractionation of normal
human serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation showed that
proteins precipitated between 40% and 55% saturation
contained most of the  xxxg2297xxx  binding activity, although
significant binding was also detected in the fraction precipitated at an ammonium sulfate saturation of 40% (data not
shown). the purification procedure used for the isolation of
the binding protein and the western blot-based assay used for
the detection of  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein are described under
experimental procedures. during affini-filter chromatography, most of the  xxxg2297xxx  binding activity eluted at 0.5 m
nacl together with residualalbumin (data not shown). fplc
on a monoq column proved to be very efficient for further
purification of the  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein. sds-page
followed by silver staining revealed that incubation of fractions
from monoq-fplc with recombinant  xxxg2297xxx  protein resulted
in the partial disappearance of a >200-kda band and the
appearanceofa new bandat 120 kda (figure3). this finding
suggests that the human  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein is greater
than 200 kda in size and hence considerably greater than its
complex with  xxxg2297xxx . during fplc on superdex 200, the
 xxxg2297xxx  binding protein eluted with a retention volume
corresponding to a molecular mass of about 270 kda.

about so-fold before sds-page which was performed on
4-15% paa gradient gels or 8% paa gels under reducing
conditions. proteins were transferred electrophoretically to
pvdf membranes. cbb staining revealed the presence of
only one band greater than 200 kda which was cut for
microsequencing.
microsequencing of the  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein resulted in
double signals for the first five cycles and one signal for each
of the following seven cycles. comparison of the resulting
sequences with sequences stored in proteindatabases revealed
that they identify 2 of the 3 chains of the human inter-a(trypsin) inhibitor (lal): the  xxxg151xxx  chain of la1 was
represented by its 12 n-terminal amino acids whereas the
heavy chain 2 ( xxxg2057xxx ) was represented by its 5 n-terminal
amino acids (table i). it is noteworthy that serio of the
 xxxg151xxx  chain could not be identified. no signals corresponding to the heavy chain 1 (hci) of i d were retrieved. the
microsequencingdata along with the molecular massof -250
kda (determined by sds-page) indicate that the  xxxg2297xxx 
binding protein is ial. rather than inli whose molecular mass
is 130-140 kda (enghild et al., 1989; rouet et al., 1992).
subsequent microsequencing of another preparation of lal
purified from humanserumallowed theidentificationof hci
besides  xxxg2057xxx  and  xxxg151xxx . however, the detected amount of
hci wassubstantially lower thanthat ofthetwootherchains

equimolarratios (table 2). interestingly, serloofthebikunin
chain, which was not detectable during microsequencing of
101 (see table i). was found in an equimolar amount in the
tsg-6iiai complex. the unexpected appearance of a serine
residue in position iocould reflect the presenceofanadditional
chain or partial modification of one or more n-termini. a
less likely possibility is that ser'o of the  xxxg151xxx  chain, which
is glycosylated in ial, might become deglycosylated in the
process of tsg-6ilal complex formation.
the srable cross-link in the tsg-6iial complex is
prouided by a glycosaminoglycan chain. the stability of
the 120-kda tsg-61lal complex during sds-page under
reducing conditions raises the question of the nature of the
interaction between  xxxg2297xxx  and the other components of the
complex. addition of 8 m urea before sds-page did not
affect the 120-kda complex (figure 6). the effect of
treatment with 8 m guanidine hydrochloride could not be
fully evaluated because the detectability of both the  xxxg2297xxx 
band and the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex in western blots was
significantly diminished. however, the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex
was still detectable after treatment with 8 m guanidine
hydrochloride (data not shown). taken together, these data
reflect the high stability of the tsg-6ilai complex, and the
formation of a covalent bond cannot be ruled out.
i t is known that the three polypeptide chains of la1 are
cross-linked by a  xxxd1687xxx  chain (enghild et al.,
1989; jessen etal., 1988: balduyck etal., 1989). it has been
shown that  xxxg151xxx ,  xxxg2057xxx  of ial1, and hc3 of p a l are
covalently bound tochondroitin4-sulfate (enghild etal., 1989,
1991, 1993). to determine if cross-linking via chondroitin
sulfate is also required for the stability of the  xxxg2297xxx /iai
complex, purified  xxxg2297xxx  protein and la1 were first incubated

the formation of rhe tsc-6/ial complex. in order to

 xxxg2297xxx  protein or la1 separately, purified  xxxg2297xxx  protein and
purified iai from human serum wereincubated with a limited
amount of chondroitinase for 16 h and then mixed with
untreated la1 or  xxxg2297xxx  protein, respectively. western blotting
revealed that la1 preincubated with  xxxd1687xxx  abc
lyase was no longer able to form a complex with untreated
 xxxg2297xxx  protein (figure 8). on the other hand, pretreatment
with chondroitinase had little effect on the ability of  xxxg2297xxx 
protein to react with untreated la1 (figure 8). a slight
decrease of the amount of tsg-6iiai complex formed by
chondroitinase-pretreated  xxxg2297xxx  (figure 8) can beexplained
by carry-over of the enzyme into the final  xxxg2297xxx -iai
incubation mixture because the chondroitinase could not be
selectively inactivated. limiting chondroitinase activity to
the necessary minimum was essential in this experiment in

7428 biochemistry, vol. 33, no. 23, 1994
order to prevent iai inactivation during the final incubation.
this finding suggests that i d , but not  xxxg2297xxx  protein, has a
chondroitinase-sensitivestructure required for the formation
of the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex.
discussion
we showed earlier that  xxxg2297xxx  synthesis is rapidly induced
in human diploid fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells after stimulation with the inflammatory cytokines t n f
and il-1 (lee et al., 1990, 1992; wisniewski et al., 1993).
the affinity of  xxxg2297xxx  protein for hyaluronan suggests a
possible association with the extracellular matrix and cartilage
(leeet al., 1992). highlevelsoftsg-6proteininthesynovial
fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and constitutive
 xxxg2297xxx  expression by cultured synovial cells from rheumatoid
joints in vitro that was further enhanced by t n f and il-1,
suggested a role for  xxxg2297xxx  in inflammatory diseases of
connective tissueandcartilage (wisniewski et al., 1993). little
is known, however, about the actions of  xxxg2297xxx  at the molecular
or cellular level. here we show that recombinant human
 xxxg2297xxx  protein is readily incorporated into a stable 120-kda
complex if incubated with human, fetal bovine, rabbit, or mouse
serum. isolation and microsequencing of the human  xxxg2297xxx 
binding protein allowed its identification as iai, an extensively
studied serum protein.
iai is a complex protein in which the  xxxg151xxx  chain is linked
to hc1 and  xxxg2057xxx  (enghild et al., 1989; gebhard et al., 1990;
rouet et al., 1992). yet, sequence analysis of the  xxxg2297xxx 
binding protein purified from human serum revealed only the
 xxxg151xxx  chain and  xxxg2057xxx  (table l ) , and no indication for the
presence of hc1 was obtained. subsequent sequencing of
another preparation of iai purified from human serum resulted
in the detection of very weak signals for the sequence of h c 1,
corresponding to about one-tenth of the other two chains on
a molar basis. other investigators who reported n-terminal
sequencing data for i a i also received incomplete and divergent
sequences for hc1 when sequencing the unmodified i a i
molecule (enghild et al., 1989; jessen et al., 1988; malki et
al., 1992). nevertheless, little doubt exists that the  xxxg2297xxx 
binding protein is iai because i a i is the only member of this
protein family with a molecular mass greater than 200 kda.
iali, which consists of  xxxg151xxx  and  xxxg2057xxx , the two chains we
detected by microsequencing, has a molecular mass of only
130-140 kda (enghild et al., 1989; rouet et al., 1992). in
addition, we found that purified i a i forms what appears to
be the same 120-kda complex with  xxxg2297xxx  protein as whole
serum (figures 4 and 5 ) . while there is no doubt that i a i
is the  xxxg2297xxx  binding protein we have isolated, it is possible
that iali or  xxxd2211xxx  also can bind  xxxg2297xxx  protein.
evidence that the reaction between  xxxg2297xxx  and la1 indeed
yields a complex of  xxxg2297xxx  with one or more polypeptide chains
of i a i is provided by the immunoprecipitation data (figure
2). further information about the composition of the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex is derived from western blot analysis. antisera
specific for either  xxxg2297xxx  protein or iai detected a 120-kda
band newly formed upon incubation of  xxxg2297xxx  protein and
iai with each other (figure 5 ) , suggesting the presence of
 xxxg2297xxx  and i a i epitopes in the complex. this was confirmed
by microsequencing of the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex (table 2)
which revealed the presence of three chains:  xxxg2297xxx  protein,
 xxxg151xxx , and  xxxg2057xxx . the signals of all three chains are
represented in nearly equimolar amounts, suggesting that the
complex contains one of each polypeptide chain. no signals
corresponding to h c 1 could be detected. the molecular mass
of the complex is surprisingly low if one considers the molecular

wisniewski et al.
masses of the incorporated polypeptides.  xxxg2057xxx  has a molecular
mass of 70 kda (enghild et al., 1989), the reported molecular
mass of  xxxg151xxx  is 26-70 kda depending on the extent of
glycosylation (gebhard et al., 1990; rouet et al., 1992), and
that of recombinant  xxxg2297xxx  protein is 32 kda. the fact that
the apparent molecular mass of the 120-kda complex is less
than the sum of its components suggests that some additional
modifications, such as deglycosylation or limited proteolytic
cleavage, might take place. alternatively, changes of thegross
structure of the complex due to incorporation of  xxxg2297xxx  could
have a substantial effect on its apparent molecular mass.
the unusual stability of the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex raises the
question of the nature of the bonds linking its components.
the resistance of the complex to boiling in 2% sds and 5%
@- xxxd26xxx  as well as to 8 m urea makes any
noncovalent hydrophobic or hydrophilic bond unlikely. in
addition, the strict temperature dependence of  xxxg2297xxx /iai
complex formation (figure 4) suggests that the reaction
involves an activated transition state and supports the notion
that a covalent bond is formed. however, an unusually stable
noncovalent association of  xxxg2297xxx  with the glycosaminoglycan
chain of the complex cannot be ruled out. the polypeptide
chains of iai are cross-linked by a chondroitin 4-sulfate chain
(enghild et al., 1989; jessen et al., 1988; balduyck et al.,
1989). the sensitivity of the  xxxg2297xxx /iai complex to  xxxd1687xxx  abc lyase (figure 7) and the inability of
chondroitinase-pretreated i a i to form the complex (figure
8) suggest that the chondroitin 4-sulfate chain cross-linking
the polypeptide chains of iai is also required for the formation
of the 120-kda complex. it has been shown that the
chondroitin 4-sulfate chain of i a i is bound to ser'o of  xxxg151xxx 
via a common gal-gal-xyl oligosaccharide (enghild et al.,
1989, 1991; chirat et al., 1991). an unusual ester bond has
been shown to cross-link the a-carboxylic group of the  xxxg2057xxx 
c-terminal asp648of iali to c-6 of an internal n-acetylgalactosamine of the chondroitin 4-sulfate chain (enghild et
al., 1993). a similar bond cross-links the c-terminal asp6**
of hc3 to chondroitin 4-sulfate in  xxxd2211xxx  (enghild et al., 1991,
1993). analysis of the cdnas of the three heavy chains
showed that all have the conserved consensus sequence
vxxdphfii, supposed to determine the cleavage site for
the c-terminal propeptide (bourguignon et al., 1993) after
the  xxxd233xxx  residue. this cleavage generates the free
a-carboxylic groupof the now c-terminal asparticacid residue
which forms the ester bond to an internal n-acetylgalactosamine of chondroitin 4-sulfate, two reactions that may be
closely coupled. interestingly,  xxxg2297xxx  also features a core of
the consensus sequence vxxdp249. hence, it is conceivable
that  xxxg2297xxx  forms a direct covalent bond to the chondroitin
4-sulfate chain of iai. additional studies are required to
determine the molecular structures formed and the exact
nature of the interactions leading to the formation of the
exceedingly stable tsg-6iiai complex.
although the trypsin-inhibitory activity of i a i has been
known for a long time (heide et al., 1965), little is known
about the functions of the different members of the iai family.
however, disease-associated presence in various tissues and
fluctuations seen in the serum levels of i a i and iai-related
proteins suggest an involvement in pathologic processes.
daveau et al. (1993) reported a distinct pattern of changes
in serum concentrations of the different members of the i a i
family during acute inflammation. proteins identical with,
or closely related to, the bikuninchain of iai have been detected
in the stroma and the surrounding connective tissue of
malignant tumors (yoshida et al., 1989), in brain tissue of

stable complex of  xxxg2297xxx  with inter-a-inhibitor
patients with alzheimer’s disease (yoshida et al., 1991), and
in serum and urine of patients with inflammatory disease,
cancer, and leukemias (rudman et al., 1976; franck &
pedersen, 1983; chawla et al., 1990). a link between i a i and
rheumatoid arthritis was suggested over 20 years ago when
becker and sandson (1971) found i a i associated with
hyaluronan in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, whereas no i a i was detectable in control synovial
fluids. this finding was confirmed and extended to show that
i a i associates in vitro with hyaluronan isolated from the
synovial fluid of healthy subjects (hutadilok et al., 1988).
huang et al. (1993) showed recently that in the presence of
serum the two heavy chains of i a i become covalently associated
with hyaluronan.
the possible functional implications of complex formation
between  xxxg2297xxx  and i a i are still elusive. though  xxxg2297xxx  has
been detected in human serum, it is most prominent at sites
of local inflammation (wisniewski et al., 1993; and unpublished results). therefore,  xxxg2297xxx /iai interaction probably
occurs most readily at inflammatory sites such as the synovial
tissue in rheumatoid arthritis, where both  xxxg2297xxx  and i a i are
found at high concentrations together with hyaluronan.
indeed, synovial fluids from arthritis patients contained both
the free 35-kda form and the 120-kda complexed form of
 xxxg2297xxx  protein (wisniewski et al., 1993). recently, the rabbit
homologue of  xxxg2297xxx  has been cloned and characterized as
a developmentally regulated protein (feng & liau, 1993),
supporting the idea that  xxxg2297xxx  might play a role in
developmental processes. tissue remodeling could be the
common denominator of  xxxg2297xxx  association with developmental and inflammatory processes. the fact that human
 xxxg2297xxx  forms complexes of equal size with i a i from different
mammalian species indicates that the molecular structures
involved in the interaction are well conserved among mammals,
perhaps reflecting selective pressure due to functional and
structural constraints.
