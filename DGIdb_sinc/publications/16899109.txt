abstract

more of patients with mtx naïve/early ra do not achieve
50% or better clinical improvement in established disease.
this unmet need for effective interventions in ra clearly
mandates further research, especially when the objective,
today, is clinical remission. nonresponsiveness to tnf
blockade and/or residual disease activity, as well as the
continuing, albeit slower progression of joint damage in a
proportion of patients treated with tnf inhibitors suggest
that tnf is not the sole responsible biological target in the
disease process, and therefore further novel agents and novel
strategies are needed.

the therapeutic success of biological agents, especially the
 xxxg2296xxx  (tnf) inhibitors, has opened a new chapter
in the book of therapies for rheumatoid arthritis. nevertheless, more
than 50% of patients may not respond by > 50% improvement.
new compounds have recently entered the treatment arena. one
of these is rituximab, which depletes b cells, and another,
 xxxd52xxx , interferes with t-cell co-stimulation. however, although
these agents may be effective in a number of patients who fail to
respond to tnf blockade, they only rarely induce remission and
overall 50% response rates do not exceed those with the tnf
inhibitors. among the major proinflammatory cytokines, il-6 plays a
pleiotropic role both in terms of activating the inflammatory
response and osteoclastogenesis. here, we review recent phase ii
trials of  xxxd3388xxx , a humanized anti-il-6 receptor antibody that
achieves a significant therapeutic response rate.

introduction
severe manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (ra), particularly
rapidly progressive and severe disability but also vasculitis and
amyloidosis, have become rare. this is attributable to progress
made over recent decades in treatment strategies that
effectively suppress disease activity. we have learned to use
traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs early and
intensively, especially methotrexate (mtx), which is considered
the ‘gold standard’ of care for patients with ra. however, the
responses of patients with ra to treatment with so-called
standard disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as mtx,
alone or in combination, is suboptimal in a significant
proportion of patients [1]. the more recently developed
biological agents, when used in combination with mtx, yield
better clinical responses in mtx refractory or naïve patients; for
example, as many as 75% of patients treated with an antitumour necrosis factor (tnf) biological drug were reported to
exhibit clinical responses [2]. moreover, the tnf blockers have
particular efficacy in inhibiting progression of joint damage.
despite the undoubted benefits attributable to current
biological targeted interventions, in most studies 50% or

the ideal profile for a new drug is one that targets a
molecule or a cell population that is involved in pathogenesis, with equivalent (or better) efficacy compared with
existing therapies in terms of effect on signs and symptoms
and progression of joint damage, and with a safety profile
similar to or better than that of current treatments. also, it
may be possible to combine drugs that target more than one
molecule and pathogenic pathway to increase efficacy
further.
following the revolution created by the three tnf blockers
already licensed for treatment of ra, new agents have been
or are being developed, for example  xxxd52xxx  and rituximab,
and new il-1 and tnf inhibitors.  xxxd52xxx  interferes with
t cell costimulation [3] and rituximab depletes b cells and
thus interferes with autoantibody production and antigen
presentation [4]. these and other approaches could be
useful for treating anti-tnf nonresponders (for review [5]). an
important cytokine with significant involvement in the
immunoinflammatory response, namely il-6, is the subject of
the present review.
il-6 is expressed in a large proportion of cells in rheumatoid
synovial tissue but not in osteoarthritis [6,7]. it has been
shown that tnf levels are twice as high in ra as in psoriatic
arthritis and 9-10 times higher in ra than in osteoarthritis [8];

this is also true of il-6. similarly, serum levels of il-6 in tnf
transgenic animals (tnf-knockout mice) are considerably
elevated, and these animals have progressive and
aggressively destructive arthritis [9]. in accordance with
these observations, tnf blockade reduces il-6 serum levels
[10], indicating an inter-relationship between these cytokines.
it is important to note, however, that this is a downstream
effect and that tnf blockade does not directly block the
activity of il-6.
other articles in this supplement report the pleiotropic
activities of il-6, all of which are characteristic of ra. il-6
binds either to a membrane-bound il-6 receptor or to a
soluble receptor [11]. when il-6 binds to the soluble
receptor, it is not neutralized but can continue to signal via
gp130 [11]. this signalling process is inhibited by antibodies
to the il-6 receptor.  xxxd3388xxx  is a humanized antibody that
binds both to soluble and to membrane-bound il-6 receptor.
it blocks the receptor complex, leading to prevention of all
transmembrane signalling by il-6 [11].

clinical data
two phase ii studies, conducted in japan [12] and europe
[13], have already been completed.
japanese data
this study involved three infusions every 4 weeks at a dose of
either 4 or 8 mg/kg, with an end-point at 4 weeks after the
third infusion. the baseline characteristics of the study
groups are shown in table 1 [12].

the results of the study show that an american college of
rheumatology (acr)20 response at the 8 mg/kg dose of
 xxxd3388xxx  was achieved in the 80% range, as compared with
page 2 of 4
(page number not for citation purposes)

a placebo response of 20%; at the 4 mg/kg dose the acr20
response was in the 50% range. likewise, the acr50 scores
were numerically higher than in the placebo group (approximately 40% for the 8 mg/kg dose), and an acr70 was
achieved by approximately 15%, with no response in the
placebo group [12].
il-6 has effect on  xxxg520xxx  (crp), an acute-phase
reactant produced by the liver, and a clear dose response
was discerned after 4 weeks. crp was normalized in the
8 mg/kg dose group, and in the 4 mg/kg dose group there
was significant reduction but not normalization, suggesting
that 8 mg/kg was the more effective dose. a similar result
was found for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
european data (the charisma study)
this charisma study [13] included patients who had been
treated with mtx but still had active disease despite mtx
therapy. the study design is shown in figure 1.

baseline demographics were similar between the
groups, with no statistically significant differences
demographic data show that the participants all

(das28)

the results for monotherapy revealed that the 2 mg/kg dose
was not effective and the 4 mg/kg was effective, but the best
results for monotherapy were seen with the 8 mg/kg dose,
with a 63% acr20 response, a 41% acr50 response and
a 16% acr70 response [13]. however, when  xxxd3388xxx 
was added to mtx, there was a 74% acr20 response, a
53% acr50 and 37% acr70 response for the 8 mg/kg
dose group. this was approximately twice as high as in the

monotherapy and combination dose groups, in which there
was no plateau to the das28 response by the end of the
study.

safety data
adverse events must be expected with use of a biological
agent, especially those related to blockade of the target and
its physiological activities. blocking il-6 led to increases in
liver enzymes as well as serum lipid levels. elevations in lipid
levels may occur, with rapid interference with the inflammatory response [14]. this is reflected by the abrupt
decrease in crp levels. the lipid abnormalities are not
necessarily an adverse event because the atherogenic index
in the charisma trial was essentially unchanged. changes
in lipid levels have been observed with other anti-inflammatory
drugs and with other biologics. during  xxxd3388xxx  therapy,
reduction in neutrophils was observed with neutropenia in a
small proportion of patients [13].
charisma study design. four week stabilization on a fixed dose of
methotrexate was followed by randomization into seven parallel arms
[13]. intravenous infusions were administered at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12,
and observations were recorded every other week through to 20 weeks.

placebo (plus mtx) group. thus,  xxxd3388xxx  monotherapy is
effective, and its combination with mtx has even greater
efficacy.
essentially, similar data were seen using the das28 score
rather than the acr response criteria. furthermore, there
may be sustained effects, as demonstrated for 8 mg/kg

interfering with the immune system often increases the risk for
infections, as has been observed with tnf-blocking therapies,
and this has also been observed with il-6 inhibition. in the
european study [13] there were also two cases of sepsis not
otherwise specified (in the 8 mg/kg combination group); this
potential tendency must be monitored and investigated further
in the context of phase iii trials.
because  xxxd3388xxx  is a humanized antibody, immunogenicity and infusion reactions were expected and have been
observed. in the european charisma study [13], for
example, five severe hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid/allergic)
reactions were observed, but these were exclusively in the
low-dose monotherapy groups.

conclusion
il-6 is an important proinflammatory cytokine and is
importantly involved in the pathogenesis of ra. blocking the
il-6 receptor with  xxxd3388xxx  leads to significant improvement in signs and symptoms, and leads to reduction in and
almost normalization of the acute-phase response.
the results of currently completed studies indicate that
 xxxd3388xxx  treatment (as monotherapy or combination therapy)
has a safety pattern consistent with that of other biological and
immunosuppressive therapies. large-scale phase iii studies are
currently ongoing in both asian and caucasian populations in
an attempt to confirm the reported clinical findings, to analyze
the effects of  xxxd3388xxx  on radiographic progression, and to
assess the full safety profile of this new compound.
