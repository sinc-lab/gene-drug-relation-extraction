abstract after heterologous expression in escherichia coli, the
azotobacter vinelandii rhodanese rhda is puriﬁed in a persulfurated form (rhda-ssh). we identiﬁed l -cysteine as the most
eﬀective sulfur source in producing rhda-ssh. an e. coli soluble extract was required for in vitro persulfuration of rhda, and
the addition of pyridoxal-5 0 -phosphate increased rhda-ssh
production, indicating a likely involvement of a cysteine desulfurase. we were able to show the formation of a covalent complex
between  xxxg1562xxx  and rhda. by combining a time-course ﬂuorescence assay and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated
the transfer of sulfur from e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  to rhda.

1. introduction
rhodaneses (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, e.c.
2.8.1.1) are widespread enzymes that in vitro catalyze the
transfer of a sulfane sulfur atom from thiosulfate to cyanide
via a protein-bound persulﬁde group. they are either composed of a single catalytic rhodanese domain, or are a fusion
of two rhodanese domains, with the c-terminal domain containing the putative catalytic cysteine [1–6]. the biological role
of rhodaneses is still largely debated, and the observed abundance of potentially functional rhodanese-like proteins also
within the same genome (pfam accession number:
pf00581; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam/) suggests
their involvement in distinct biological processes. proposed
functions for rhodaneses include cyanide detoxiﬁcation, formation of prosthetic groups in iron–sulfur cluster proteins,
and sulfur transfer for thiamine, thiouridine or molybdopterin
biosynthesis [7–11]. cellular sulfur traﬃcking requires specialized systems to avoid production of sulfur in a toxic form, and
formation of persulﬁde groups on a protein scaﬀold represents
a biological strategy to sequester sulfur in an activated form
for biosynthetic purposes [12–16].

azotobacter vinelandii rhda [17] appears to be a unique
member of the rhodanese homology superfamily [1,18,19].
the rhda active-site motif (hcqthhr) is not currently
found in rhodanese-like proteins, and generates an unusually
strong positive electrostatic ﬁeld [1] that favors stabilization
of a persulﬁde bond on the catalytic cysteine residue
(cys230), the only cysteine residue in this protein. after heterologous expression in escherichia coli, a. vinelandii rhda is
puriﬁed in a mixture of persulfurated rhda (rhda-ssh)
and of the sulfane sulfur-deprived rhda. the presence of
these forms can be assessed by 15n nmr spectroscopy [20],
as well as by intrinsic ﬂuorescence measurements on the isolated protein [18], and by mass spectrometry [21]. the observation that these forms were found in variable ratios after
overexpressions of rhda in rich medium (lb), prompted us
to investigate the nature of the sulfur source for rhda-ssh
production in e. coli.
in the present work, rhda was expressed in e. coli in
minimal medium to determine the nature of the sulfur
sources used for producing rhda-ssh. we found that l cysteine was the most eﬀective sulfur source. addition of
pyridoxal-5 0 -phosphate (plp) to the e. coli cell extracts increased the production of rhda-ssh in vitro, suggesting
the involvement of plp-dependent cysteine desulfurases
[16], such as  xxxg1562xxx , in this process. indeed, by combining
mass spectrometry analysis and a time-course ﬂuorescence
assay, we demonstrated that e. coli  xxxg1562xxx  can eﬃciently transfer sulfur to rhda. the formation of a rhda– xxxg1562xxx  complex,
under deﬁned interaction conditions, suggests molecular recognition between the sulfur donor  xxxg1562xxx  and the acceptor
rhda.

2. materials and methods
2.1. bacterial strains, cell culture, and treatments
overexpression of his-tagged rhda was carried out in e. coli
bl21[prep4, pqer1] [18]. to deﬁne the sulfur source for rhda persulfuration, cells were grown in 100 ml of m9 minimal medium [22]
supplemented with basal medium eagleõs vitamin solution (10 ml/l,
bme, sigma–aldrich) and antibiotics according to the plasmid
requirements. when the culture reached a600 0.6, the medium was replaced with fresh m9-bme medium supplemented with 1 mm iptg,
2 mm l- leucine, 2 mm l- isoleucine and 2 mm of the selected sulfur
source ( xxxd2534xxx , l- methionine, l- cysteine or thiosulfate). the possible
toxicity of cysteine was by-passed by addition of 2 mm l -leucine and

2 mm l -isoleucine [23]. after 4-h growth, the cells were harvested by
centrifugation (5000 · g, 15 min) and washed in 100 ml water. cell-free
extracts were always obtained as previously described [24].
2.2. protein preparations
overespressed his-tagged rhda was puriﬁed by ni-nta aﬃnity
chromatography [24], and gelﬁltered using a g25 column equilibrated
in 50 mm tris–hcl, 100 mm nacl (ph 8). sulfane sulfur-deprived
rhda was prepared by incubating puriﬁed rhda with a 10-fold molar
excess of kcn for 15 min at room temperature, and by removing excess kcn by gelﬁltration. cys230-blocked rhda (rhda-mbbr) was
obtained by incubation of 156 lm sulfane sulfur-deprived rhda in
50 mm tris–hcl, 100 mm nacl buﬀer (ph 8) with 5 mm monobromobimane (mbbr, thiolyte, calbiochem, darmstadt, germany). after
2 h in the dark at room temperature with continuous stirring, the reaction mixture was gelﬁltered on a g-25 sephadex column. the binding
of mbbr to rhda was assessed by ﬂuorescence [25]. recombinant  xxxg1562xxx 
was puriﬁed from bl21(de3) e. coli strain harboring psl209 [11].
the persulﬁde form of  xxxg1562xxx  ( xxxg1562xxx -ssh) was prepared by incubation
of  xxxg1562xxx  with an excess of l -cysteine for 5 min at 4 c. for the puriﬁcation of  xxxg1562xxx -ssh, the incubation mixture was gelﬁltered using a pd10
column (ge healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.2.
protein concentration was determined by the method of bradford
[26].
2.3. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms)
sulfane sulfur-deprived rhda (20 lm) was incubated overnight at
room temperature with 2 lm  xxxg1562xxx  and 2 mm l- cysteine in 50 mm
tris–hcl 100 mm nacl (ph 8). after the incubation, the buﬀer was
exchanged with 5 mm ammonium acetate, and 1–3 ll aliquots were diluted 1:1 with methanol, made 10 lm in  xxxd2154xxx , and applied to
nanospray gold-coated glass capillaries placed orthogonally in front
of the entrance hole of a qtof2 mass spectrometer (micromass, manchester, uk). approximately 1000 v were applied to the capillary and
the resulting multiple charge ions were separated by the time-of-ﬂight
analyzer. the raw spectra were deconvoluted using the max. xxxg2131xxx  software package (micromass).
2.4. maldi/tof peptide mass ﬁngerprinting
protein bands were cut out from a 1d sds-gel, reduced and carboxamidomethylated, and then subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. the
resulting peptides were extracted, desalted using ziptip devices (millipore, bedford, usa) and analyzed by maldi/tof-ms using a bruker ultraﬂex time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer (bruker daltonics,
bremen, germany).
2.5. spectroscopic characterization
fluorescence measurements were carried out in a perkin–elmer ls50 instrument, and data were analyzed as previously described [18].
the following formula was used to calculate the extent of rhda persulfuration:
rhda-ssh ð%þ ¼

f cn  f 0
 100;
f cn  f thio

where f0 is the intrinsic ﬂuorescence (kexc = 280 nm; kem = 340 nm) of
the isolated rhda, fcn and fthio the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of the protein after cyanide and thiosulfate addition, respectively.

fig. 1. analysis of rhda persulfuration. the ﬁgures of extent of
rhda persulfuration were calculated for all experiments by the
sequential ﬂuorescence measurements depicted in the inset: to 6 lm
rhda (full line) was added either kcn (0.25 mm; dashed line) or
na2s2o3 (1.5 mm; dotted line). (a) data from four sets of separated
growth experiments with the addition of the indicated sulfur sources
(bars indicate standard deviation). rhda from cultures grown in the
presence of the selected sulfur source was puriﬁed from cell-free
extracts using a batch procedure of nickel-aﬃnity chromatography.
the aﬃnity-bound rhda recovered by elution with 300 mm imidazole
in 50 mm tris–hcl, 300 mm nacl buﬀer (ph 8) was used for the
ﬂuorescence measurements. (b) 100 lm rhda in 300 ll 50 mm tris–
hcl, 300 mm nacl (ph 8) was incubated 2 h at 30 c in the presence
of 2 mm l -cysteine (2), with addition of 50 lg of e. coli (mg1655
strain) protein extract in the absence (3), and in the presence of 10 lm
plp (4). untreated rhda is shown as control (1). before ﬂuorescence
measurements the mixtures were gel-ﬁltered. bars indicate standard
deviation from three independent experiments.

3. results
3.1. production of rhda in the persulfurated form
heterologous expression of a. vinelandii rhda in e. coli
in a minimal medium containing either sulfate, l -methionine,
l -cysteine and thiosulfate as sulfur source resulted in diﬀerent levels of rhda-ssh (fig. 1a). the level of rhda persulfuration was determined by sequential ﬂuorometric
measurements, as depicted in the inset to fig. 1a. among
the sulfur sources tested, l -cysteine was most eﬀective in
increasing rhda-ssh production, followed by thiosulfate

(the sulfane sulfur donor to rhda in the in vitro catalyzed
reaction).
we tested whether l -cysteine can act as direct sulfane sulfur
donor to puriﬁed rhda [24] in the presence and in the absence
of other cellular components. as shown in fig. 1b, the presence
of the e. coli soluble extract is required for rhda persulfuration in vitro (fig. 1b; cfr 2 vs. 3). addition of pyridoxal-5 0 phosphate (plp) to the reaction mixture further improved
the yield of rhda-ssh (fig. 1b; 4), indicating that the reaction

6788

f. forlani et al. / febs letters 579 (2005) 6786–6790

was catalyzed by one of the plp-dependent cysteine desulfurases present in e. coli [16].
3.2. sulfur transfer from  xxxg1562xxx  to rhda
at least three diﬀerent cysteine desulfurases have been identiﬁed so far in e. coli, namely  xxxg1562xxx , csda and sufs [16]. considering that in the a. vinelandii genome an  xxxg1562xxx -like protein
(in addition to the  xxxg1562xxx  protein coded by the nif operon) has
been identiﬁed and characterized, and that a mutation in  xxxg1562xxx 
is lethal in this organism [27], we focused our attention on the
molecular interaction between rhda and e. coli  xxxg1562xxx . e. coli
and a. vinelandii  xxxg1562xxx  show a sequence identity of 74%, and
share the same consensus sequence (ssgsacts) around the
catalytic cysteine [16].
to study the sulfur transfer from  xxxg1562xxx  to rhda in vitro we
developed a time-course ﬂuorescence assay to monitor changes
of rhda intrinsic ﬂuorescence in various reaction mixtures in
the presence of 12 mm l -cysteine, a substrate concentration in
the range of that used in standard activity assay for cysteine
desulfurases [28]. clear changes of rhda ﬂuorescence were detected in the presence of  xxxg1562xxx  and l -cysteine (fig. 2, full line),
but not when l -cysteine was omitted (fig. 2, dashed-dotted
line). in this latter case, the rhda ﬂuorescence decreased only
after the addition of thiosulfate. when rhda was treated with
l -cysteine and bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa), no change in
ﬂuorescence was observed, and again a decrease in ﬂuorescence was only observed after the addition of thiosulfate
(fig. 2, dotted line).
monobromobimane (mbbr) was used to block the reactive
cys230 in rhda, thus producing rhda-mbbr with less than
2% residual thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity. no
ﬂuorescence changes were measured on rhda-mbbr also after
the addition of thiosulfate (fig. 2, dashed line).
after incubation of rhda with  xxxg1562xxx  and l -cysteine for 350 s,
the extent of rhda persulfuration was determined to be 72%.
considering that in our experimental system the acceptor
rhda was present in a 5-fold molar excess over  xxxg1562xxx , it seems
that  xxxg1562xxx  was able to perform multiple cycles of sulfur transfer.
eighty percent persulfuration of rhda was obtained after

fig. 2. time-course ﬂuorescence measurements. the intrinsic ﬂuorescence changes (kexc = 280 nm, kem = 340 nm) following the addition of
0.4 lm puriﬁed  xxxg1562xxx  were monitored in 1 ml of 50 mm tris–hcl,
100 mm nacl, ph 8, containing: 2 lm sulfane sulfur-deprived rhda,
either in the absence (dashed-dotted line) or in the presence of 12 mm
l -cysteine (full line); 2 lm rhda-mbbr in the presence of 12 mm l cysteine (dashed line). as a control: 0.4 lm bsa (instead of  xxxg1562xxx ) was
added to sulfane sulfur-deprived rhda in the presence of 12 mm l cysteine (dotted line). addition of  xxxg1562xxx  or bsa is denoted by (*),
whereas addition of 0.5 mm na2s2o3 by (#).

deconvoluted esi spectra of: rhda and  xxxg1562xxx  in the presence of l cysteine (a), rhda after incubation with 0.1 mm na2s2o3 (b), sulfane

cysteine residue of rhda can be readily observed by a mass increase of
32 da characteristic of the persulﬁde loaded protein.

incubation with equimolar amounts of persulfurated iscsssh, without the addition of extra l -cysteine (data not
shown), ruling out the involvement of non-protein thiols during the sulfur transfer process to rhda.
the transfer of sulfane sulfur from  xxxg1562xxx  to rhda was conﬁrmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (esi-ms) (fig. 3).
the mass spectra of rhda upon incubation with  xxxg1562xxx  in the
presence of l -cysteine (fig. 3a) show a main species at
31 083 da, revealing an increase of 32 da over the molecular
mass of cyanide-treated rhda (31 051 da, fig. 3c). the
31 083 da species was also seen after incubation of rhda with
thiosulfate (fig. 3b). the additional peak approximately
19 da up mass (fig. 3a) can be explained by the presence of
+
nhþ
4 and/or na adducts in the less concentrated sample.
3.3. inter-protein complex formation upon interaction between
 xxxg1562xxx  and rhda
when equimolar amounts of rhda and  xxxg1562xxx  were incubated
overnight, and then separated by sds–page under notreducing conditions, a protein band of mr 80 000 was observed
(fig. 4, lane 1). western blot analysis revealed that this protein
band was recognized by anti-rhda antibody (not shown).
ms-peptide mapping of the tryptic peptides obtained after
in-gel digestion from the gel slice showed that the protein band
of mr 80 000 was indeed a complex between rhda and  xxxg1562xxx 
(data not shown). all major signals obtained after maldi/
tof ﬁngerprinting could be assigned to peptides originating
either from rhda or  xxxg1562xxx , unequivocally demonstrating the
presence of a complex of both proteins in the gel band. formation of the rhda– xxxg1562xxx  complex did not occur when rhdambbr replaced rhda (fig. 4, lane 4). the inter-protein

samples, incubated overnight at 25 c and resolved by sds–page
without the use of 2- xxxd26xxx , contained: 15 lm rhda and
15 lm  xxxg1562xxx  previously incubated in the absence (lane 1) and in the
presence of l -cysteine (0.75 mm: lane 6; 1.5 mm: lane 7; 3 mm: lane 8;
6 mm: lane 9; 12 mm: lane 10); rhda-mbbr and  xxxg1562xxx  (lane 4). runs
of the individual protein in the absence of l -cysteine are also shown
(lane 2: rhda; lane 3:  xxxg1562xxx ; lane 5: rhda-mbbr). the gel was stained
with coomassie blue. interprotein complexes are identiﬁed as: ++,
( xxxg1562xxx )2; *+,  xxxg1562xxx /rhda complex; **, (rhda)2; +,  xxxg1562xxx ; *, rhda. mr,
denotes the position of the molecular weight standards.

complex formation was dependent on the l -cysteine concentration present during the interaction of rhda with  xxxg1562xxx . as
shown in fig. 4 (lanes 6–10), the rhda– xxxg1562xxx  complex was detected only at l -cysteine concentration lower than 0.8 mm.

under these conditions sulfane sulfur loading of rhda via cysteine desulfurase reaction could be limited, but formation of
the hetero-complex indicated an intimate contact between
the interacting proteins, representing the ﬁrst step in the sulfur
exchange process. l -cysteine concentrations higher than
0.8 mm likely favor sulfur transfer to rhda, and the release
of rhda-ssh.
the in vivo substrate(s) of rhda-ssh are thus far not identiﬁed, but in vitro investigations demonstrated that rhda-ssh
can function as sulfur carrier to deliver sulfur in an ‘‘activated’’
form for 2fe–2s cluster synthesis [21]. the present investigation indicates a role of the rhodanese rhda in assisting elemental sulfur mobilization (mediated by cysteine desulfurase), thus
minimizing the loss of sulfur to cellular reductants [15], and
maintaining, in conditions of high sulfur mobilization, the sulfur in a protected/activated (and non-toxic) form. although
our results were obtained in an ‘‘heterologous system’’, they
provide novel insights for deﬁning the cellular function of
rhodaneses, that cannot be limited to cyanide scavenging in
view of their broad distribution and of recurrence within the
same genome.

4. discussion
in the present study, a suitable model system to address the
origin of the persulﬁde sulfur on rhodaneses was exploited,
taking advantage of the ability of a. vinelandii rhda to form
a stable persulﬁde sulfur on its catalytic cys230 [18,20]. e. coli
contains eight rhodanese-like proteins showing a variety of
amino acid residues around the catalytic cysteine. a transient
persulﬁde intermediate is detectable in both glpe and ssea,
the two e. coli sulfurtransferases structurally and functionally
characterized so far [3,4,29]. the failure to purify these proteins in a stable persulfurated form under standard conditions
could depend on the lack of a positively charged active-site, a
feature recognized to stabilize persulﬁde groups [30], or to the
presence of highly speciﬁc or highly reactive sulfur-acceptor
proteins in the homologous expression system.
the ﬂuorometric changes detectable during the formation of
persulfurated rhda were used here to monitor the transfer of
sulfane sulfur from  xxxg1562xxx  to rhda. for the ﬁrst time experimental evidence (including ms data) was provided for a rhodanese functioning as a direct acceptor of the sulfane sulfur
present on a cysteine desulfurase. so far, cysteine desulfurases
were shown to be involved in fe–s cluster biosynthesis, and to
provide the sulfur for thionucleosides in trna, and for biosynthesis of thiamine, biotin,  xxxd2494xxx , and molybdopterin
[16]. in addition, their involvement in intracellular iron
homeostasis and in the biosynthesis of selenoproteins has been
suggested [16].
molecular interaction between rhda and  xxxg1562xxx  was shown
here by the formation of a covalent complex between the
two proteins, an observation that supports speciﬁc recognition
during the sulfur exchange process [13–15,31]. in the case of
the  xxxg1562xxx /rhda interaction, protein–protein complex formation
was observed at l -cysteine concentration lower than 0.8 mm.
