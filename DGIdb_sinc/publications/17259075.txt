abstract
aspirin (asa) inhibits cycloxygenase-1 and modifies cycloxygenase-2 ( xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx ) by acetylation at ser530 , leading to a shift from
production of pgh2 , the precursor of prostaglandin, to 15-r-hete which is converted by  xxxg147xxx  to 15-epi-lipoxin a4
(15-epi-lxa4), a potent anti-inflammatory mediator. both atorvastatin (atv) and pioglitazone (pio) increase  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  expression. atv activates  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  by s-nitrosylation at cys526 to produce 15-epi-lxa4 and 6-keto-pgf1␣ (the stable metabolite of
pgi2 ). we assessed the effect of asa on the myocardial production of 15-epi-lxa4 and pgi2 after induction by lipopolysaccharide (lps) or pio + atv. sprague–dawley rats were pretreated with: control; asa 10 mg/kg; asa 50 mg/kg; lps alone;
lps + asa 10 mg/kg; lps + asa 50 mg/kg; lps + asa 200 mg/kg; pio (10 mg/kg/d) + atv (10 mg/kg/d); pio + atv + asa
10 mg/kg; pio + atv + asa 50 mg/kg; pio + atv + asa 50 mg/kg + 1400 w, a specific inos inhibitor; or pio + atv + 1400 w.
asa alone had no effect on myocardial 15-epi-lxa4. lps increased 15-epi-lxa4 and 6-keto-pgf1␣ levels. asa (50 mg/kg and
200 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg) augmented the lps effect on 15-epi-lxa4 but attenuated the effect on 6-keto-pgf1␣ . pio + atv
increased 15-epi-lxa4 and 6-keto-pgf1␣ levels. asa and 1400 w attenuated the effects of pio + atv on 15-epi-lxa4 and 6-ketopgf1␣ . however, when both asa and 1400 w were administered with pio + atv, there was a marked increase in 15-epi-lxa4,
whereas the production of 6-keto-pgf1␣ was attenuated. in conclusion,  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  acetylation by asa shifts enzyme from producing
6-keto-pgf1␣ to 15-epi-lxa4. in contrast, s-nitrosylation by pio + asa augments the production of both 15-epi-lxa4 and 6keto-pgf1␣ . however, when  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is both acetylated and s-nitrosylated, it is inactivated. we suggest potential adverse interactions
among statins, thiazolidinediones, and high-dose asa.

1. introduction
the role of aspirin [asa] in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is well established [1,2].
asa blocks cycloxygenase-1 [ xxxg1883xxx ] and thus, the production of prostaglandin and thromboxane. recent studies
have suggested that asa also modifies  xxxg1884xxx  [ xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx ] by acetylation at the ser530 near the active enzyme
site. acetylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  restricts access of  xxxd208xxx  to the catalytic core, leading to incomplete reaction
that results in the production of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15-r-hete] rather than pgh2 [the precursor of all
prostaglandins] [3–5]. 15-r-hete in turn is converted by  xxxg147xxx  to 15(r)-epi-lipoxin a4 [(5s,6r,15r)-5,6,15trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-1 1-ciseicosatetraenoic acid] [15-epi-lxa4], also called aspirin-triggered lipoxin [atl]
(fig. 1) [3,4]. 15-epi-lxa4 serves as a local anti-inflammatory mediator involved in protean and diverse human
diseases including airway inflammation and asthma, arthritis, graft versus host disease, and multiple cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, periodontal and renal diseases [4,6,7]. it has been found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
other than aspirin and selective  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors are unable to generate 15-epi-lxa4 [3]. moreover, selective  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx 
inhibitors prevent 15-epi-lxa4 generation by asa [8].

asa alone does not upregulate  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  expression, unless it causes direct damage leading to inflammatory response
such as gastritis [6]. on the contrary, asa has been shown to suppress  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  expression [9]. in inflammatory models
(peritonitis or pleuritis) for the induction of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx , high-doses of asa [125–200 mg/kg] augment 15-epi-lxa4
production [10,11]. however, in normal human volunteers low-dose asa increases 15-epi-lxa4 production more
than a high-dose treatment. chiang has reported that blood levels of 15-epi-lxa4 are greater after treatment with asa
81 mg/d than with 325 mg/d. at 650 mg/d, asa does not increase 15-epi-lxa4 at all [12]. in contrast, the inhibition
of thromboxane production is dose-dependent, reflecting a dose-dependent inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  [12]. it is plausible that
higher asa doses completely inhibit  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  activity, whereas lower doses shift activity from pgh2 to 15-r-hete
production. furthermore, the functional status of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  following asa administration may depend on the asa to
 xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  ratio. thus, in inflammatory models with robust  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  induction there would be a need for high-doses of
asa to shift enzyme activity, whereas in models without inflammation (i.e., normal volunteers), a low-dose would be
sufficient and a high-dose of asa would block  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  completely.
we have recently shown that pioglitazone [pio] [5-[[4-[2-(5-ethylpyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]thiazolidine2,4-dione] and atorvastatin [atv] [7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(1-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-(phenylcarbamoyl)-1hpyrrol-1-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy- xxxd2269xxx ] increase myocardial levels of 15-epi-lxa4 [13]. fig. 1 shows the structure
of pio, atv and asa. both pio [14] and atv [15,16] increase the expression and activity of cytosolic  xxxg1759xxx  [ xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  ] and  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  in the rat heart. we [16] and kim [17] have shown that  xxxg1578xxx 
(inos) activates  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  by s-nitrosylation. s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  occurs on all its 13 cysteine residues; however,
only s-nitrosylation of cys526 is responsible for  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  activation, as assessed by  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2 ) production [17]. we have shown that inos, induced by atv, s-nitrosylates  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  [16]. however, it is not clear how pio
activates  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx , as it does not augment inos expression and calcium-independent  xxxd2738xxx  synthase activity [16].
in contrast to asa, pio [14] and atv [14–16] increase the production of both pgi2 (prostacyclin) and pge2 . it is
still unclear how atv and pio alter  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  activity to produce 15-r-hete in addition to pgh2 (the precursor of
prostaglandins).
another  xxxd208xxx  product with potent anti-inflammatory effects is lipoxin a4 [5s,6r,15s-trihydroxy7e,9e,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid] (fig. 1) [4]. lipoxin a4 is produced by several pathways: (1) conversion
of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (generated from  xxxd208xxx  by 15-lipoxygenase) by  xxxg147xxx ; (2)
conversion of leukotrienes (produced from  xxxd208xxx  by  xxxg147xxx ) by 12-lipoxygenase; (3) interaction
between cytochrome p-450 (leading to production of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid from  xxxd208xxx ) and
 xxxg147xxx  (in the liver) [18]. we have shown that pio and atv produces minimal change in myocardial lipoxin
a4 levels [13]. however, lipopolysaccharide [lps] may trigger lipoxin a4 production, and this stimulation be affected
by asa if it is produced via cytochrome p-450 [18].
many patients are receiving both asa and a statin. in addition, increasingly diabetic patients are receiving thiazolidinediones in combination with asa and statins. the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of different
doses of asa on the myocardial production of 15-epi-lxa4, lipoxin a4 , pge2 and pgi2 by  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  that was induced
by either an inflammatory stimulation [lps injection] or non-inflammatory stimulation [pio + atv].

hearts. asa was dissolved in water and administered by oral gavage 8 h before harvesting the hearts. atv and pio
were administered by oral gavage once daily for 3 days; last dose was administered 16 h before harvesting the hearts.
about 1400 w [1 mg/kg] was administered i.v. 15 min before harvesting the hearts.
all hearts were analyzed for myocardial 15-epi-lxa4, lipoxin a4 , 6-keto-pgf1␣ [the stable metabolite of pgi2 ]
and pge2 levels.
2.3. elisa
the hearts were rapidly explanted, rinsed in cold pbs [ph 7.4], containing 0.16 mg/ml heparin to remove red
blood cells and clots, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 ◦ c. for 15-epi-lxa4 and lipoxin a4 determination,
myocardial samples from the anterior left ventricular wall were homogenized in ethanol [5 ml/g] and centrifuged at
10,000 g x15 min at 4 ◦ c. the supernatant was diluted wit water and acidified to ph 3.5 with 1 n hcl. the sample was
loaded into c-18 sep-pak light column [waters corporation, milford, ma] and washed with 1 ml of water followed
by 1 ml of petroleum ether. the sample was eluted with 2 ml of methyl formate. the methyl formate was evaporated
with n2 and the residue was dissolved in extraction buffer. we followed the manufacturer instruction of the elisa
kits.
for myocardial 6-keto-pgf1␣ and pge2 levels myocardial samples were homogenized in ripa lysis buffer with
10% proteinase inhibitor [sigma] and centrifuged. the supernatants were collected and stored on ice. measurement
of 6-keto-pgf1␣ and pge2 were performed following the manufacturer instruction of the elisa kits.

2.4. biotin switch assay
s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  was determined with the biotin switch method, as has been previously described [16].
myocardial samples from the left ventricular wall of rats treated with lps [group 4] and pio + atv [group 8] were
homogenized with hen buffer [25 mm hepes (ph 7.7)-0.1 mm edta-0.01 mm necuproine]. the supernatant containing membrane fragments and the cytosolic protein was recovered. the samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 ◦ c
with blocking solution containing hen buffer, 0.1% sds, and 20 mm  xxxd2684xxx  [nem] to block free thiols.
lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 xg for 10 min at 4 ◦ c. cold acetone was added to precipitate the proteins. the
pellets were resuspended in hen buffer with 1% sds, with 20 mm sodium ascorbate added to decompose the sno
bonds. the resulting free thiols in the sample were reacted with 0.05 mm biotinylating agent, biocytin [mpb] for 30 min
at room temperature. the excess mpb was removed by additional protein precipitation in cold acetone.  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  was
immunoprecipitated with anti- xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  polyclonal antibody. immunoprecipitates were washed three times with hen
buffer and resuspended in 50 ␮l of hen containing laemmli sample buffer, boiled at 95 ◦ c for 5 min, loaded on
10% acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. the biotinylated  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  protein was detected with horseradish
peroxidase-linked streptavidin. all procedures up to biotinylation were performed in the dark. the membranes were
stripped with a stripping buffer and blotted again with anti- xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  antibodies. the signal densities of the biotinylated
 xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  and total  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  were quantified by an image-scanning densitometer and the ratio of the densities was calculated
for each animal.
2.5. materials

atv [pfizer pharmaceuticals, new york, ny]. asa and 1400 w (c10 h15 n3 ) were purchased from sigma [st. louis,
mo]. elisa kits for 15-epi-lxa4 and lipoxin a4 were purchased from oxford biomedical research [oxford, mi]
and for 6-keto-pgf1␣ and pge2 from cayman chemicals [ann arbor, mi]. polyclonal anti- xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  antibodies were
purchased from cayman chemicals, n-(3-maleimidopropionyl) biocytin [mpb] from molecular probes [eugene, or],

3. results
3.1. the effect of asa on  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  induced by lps
asa alone [10 and 50 mg/kg] had no effect on myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels (fig. 3a). lps increased myocardial
15-epi-lxa4. asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg did not significantly alter the lps effect on 15-epi-lxa4 induction [p = 0.08 versus
lps alone]. however, asa at 50 [p < 0.001 versus lps alone] and 200 mg/kg [p < 0.001 versus lps alone] augmented
the lps induction of 15-epi-lxa4.
asa  xxxd1891xxx  and 50 mg/kg did not affect myocardial lipoxin a4 . lps caused a small increase in myocardial lipoxin
a4 levels (fig. 3b). asa  xxxd1891xxx  and 50 mg/kg did not alter the lps effect. however, at 200 mg/kg asa augmented the
effect of lps [p < 0.001 versus each of the other groups].
asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg did not affect myocardial 6-keto-pgf1␣ levels (p = 0.48)(fig. 3c). however, at 50 mg/kg, asa had
a small but significant effect (p = 0.001 versus the control group). lps significantly increased myocardial 6-keto-pgf1␣
levels (p < 0.001 versus the control group). asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg (p < 0.001 versus lps alone), 50 mg/kg (p < 0.001 versus
lps alone), and 200 mg/kg (p < 0.001 versus lps alone) attenuated the effect of lps in a dose-dependent manner.

asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg and 50 mg/kg did not significantly affect myocardial pge2 levels compared to the control group
(fig. 3d). lps caused a significant increase in myocardial pge2 levels (p < 0.001 versus control). asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg
(p < 0.001 versus lps alone), 50 mg/kg (p < 0.001 versus lps alone), and 200 mg/kg (p < 0.001 versus lps alone)
significantly attenuated the effect of lps.
3.2. the effect of asa on  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  induced by pio + atv
pio + atv significantly increased myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels. in contrast to the effect of asa on  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx 
induced by lps, asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg attenuated and at 50 mg/kg completely blocked the effect of pio + atv (fig. 4a).
in addition, 1400 w alone partially blocked the effect of pio + atv. however, when both asa 50 mg/kg and 1400 w
were administered to rats pretreated with pio + atv, myocardial levels of 15-epi-lxa4 increased to a greater extent
than when pio + atv were administered alone.
pio + atv caused a small increase in myocardial lipoxin a4 levels (fig. 4b). asa and 1400 w alone or in combination did not attenuate the effect of pio + atv.
pio + atv significantly increased myocardial 6-keto-pgf1␣ levels (fig. 4c). both 1400 w and asa  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg
and 50 mg/kg attenuated this effect. the combination of asa 50 mg/kg with 1400 w also partially blocked the effect
of pio + atv.
pio + atv significantly increased myocardial pge2 levels (fig. 4d). asa 10 mg/kg attenuated this effect, whereas
asa 50 mg/kg, 1400 w and their combination completely blocked the effect of pio + atv.
3.3. s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx 
in order to estimate the degree of s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx , induced by either pio + atv or lps, we used the biotin
switch assay (fig. 5). the assay shows a higher ratio of the signal density of the biotinylated  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  to total  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  in the

pio + atv treated rats than in the lps treated rats, suggesting that a larger percentage of the  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is s-nitrosylated
in the pio + atv group than in the lps group.
4. discussion
we have found asa to have opposite effects on lps and pio + atv induction of myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels.
in rats pretreated with lps, asa caused a dose-dependent increase in myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels. on the other
hand, in rats pretreated with pio + atv, asa inhibited the induction of 15-epi-lxa4. in contrast, in both models,
asa inhibited the increase in myocardial 6-keto-pgf1␣ and pge2 in a dose-dependent fashion.
15-epi-lxa4 is produced from 15-r-hete by  xxxg147xxx . using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
we have demonstrated that both  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  and  xxxg147xxx  are expressed in the rat myocardium [13]. it has been
reported that 15-r-hete is produced by  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  that is acetylated by asa at ser530 [3–5]. another potential source of
15-r-hete is cytochrome p-450 [18,19]. this pathway has been described in the liver [18,19] and in the human lung
adenocarcinoma cell line [a549] [20], but not in rat epidermal microsomes [21]. however, in contrast to acetylated
 xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  that is producing only 15-r-hete, cytochrome p-450 produces both 15-r-hete (that is converted to 15-epilxa4 by  xxxg147xxx ) and 15-s-hete (that is converted to lipoxin a4 by  xxxg147xxx ) [18]. thus, if produced
via cytochrome p-450, an equal increase in both lipoxin a4 and 15-epi-lxa4 is expected. in rats treated with lps we
observed an increase in both lipoxin a4 and 15-epi-lxa4 (fig. 3). asa at high-dose [200 mg/kg], but not  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg
and 50 mg/kg, augmented this effect. this finding may favor a cytochrome p-450 origin of 15-r-hete production.

fig. 5. (a) biotin switch assay showing s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  in both the pio + atv treated rats (n = 4) and lps-treated rats (n = 4). signal
intensity is stronger in the pio + atv group than in the lps group. (b) immunoblotting with  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  after stripping the membranes, showing the
precipitate in both the pio + atv and lps group contained  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx . signal intensity in the lps group is stronger than in the pio + atv group,
suggesting greater induction of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  by lps than by pio + atv. (c) the ratio of biotinylated  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  to total  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  signal density is higher in the
pio + atv group than in the lps group.

however, in a model of lps-induced peritonitis, chiang et al. have shown that a cytochrome p-450 inhibitor did
not prevent 15-epi-lxa4 formation by asa (125 mg/kg), suggesting that cytochrome p-450 does not significantly
contribute to the formation of 15-epi-lxa4 in their model [10]. thus, the lps-induction of lipoxin a4 production is
likely to be mediated by an interaction between  xxxg147xxx  with 15-lipoxygenase and 12-lipoxygenase [4,22].
in contrast, in rats pretreated with pio + atv, we saw an increase in 15-epi-lxa4, without a concomitant increase
in lipoxin a4 , suggesting that 15-r-hete is generated by  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  and not cytochrome p-450. we have previously
shown that both pio and atv increase myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels, without a significant effect on lipoxin a4
levels [13]. this dose-dependent augmentation by both pio and atv was seen after 3-days of treatment with oral 5
and 10 mg/kg/d, but not with 2 mg/kg/d [13]. myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels were significantly higher in rats treated
with pio (10 mg/kg/d) + atv [10 mg/kg/d] than in rats treated with each drug alone. both atv and pio augment
the expression and activity of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  [13,14]. the effect of pio + atv on myocardial 15-epi-lxa4 levels is blocked
by  xxxd3481xxx  [a specific  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor] and  xxxd3554xxx  [a specific  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor] [13], supporting the
production of 15-epi-lxa4 by the  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx -  xxxg147xxx  pathway.
the different effect of asa on  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  induced by pio + atv versus lps may be explained by the percentage of snitrosylation of the enzyme. the “biotin switch” assay clearly shows that a greater percentage of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is s-nitrosylated
in rats treated with pio + atv than in the lps treated rats (fig. 5). we have previously shown that atv activates
 xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  via inos-mediated s-nitrosylation [16]. intravenous administration of 1400 w at the same dose that we used
in the present study, blocks the augmentation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  activity by a 3-day pretreatment with atv [10 mg/kg/d] [16].
using the “biotin switch” assay, we have demonstrated that the atv-mediated s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is no longer
apparent 15 min after 1400 w administration [16], suggesting that s-nitrosylation is reversible. in the present study we
have found that 1400 w blocked the induction of 15-epi-lxa4 by pio + atv, indicating that s-nitrosylation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx 
is needed for 15-epi-lxa4 production.
in inflammatory model [peritonitis and pleuritis in previous studies [10,11], and lps in the present experiment
(fig. 3a)] asa augments 15-epi-lxa4 production. in contrast, in rats pretreated with pio + atv asa blocked the
production of 15-epi-lxa4 (fig. 4a). we cannot exclude the possibility that asa has a completely different effect
on  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  of inflammatory cells and that of the myocardium. it might be that in the lps treated rats asa affected

the  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  of inflammatory cells recruited into the heart, whereas in the pio and atv treated rats the effect is on the
myocardial  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx .
the activation of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  by s-nitrosylation (at least for the production of pge2 ) occurs at cys526 [17]. this site is
in close proximity to the site where asa acetylates  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  (ser530 ) [3–5]. we hypothesize that when  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is both
s-nitrosylated and acetylated, the channel within the enzyme is blocked and  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is inactivated. indeed, although
both asa 50 mg/kg and 1400 w blocked the effect of pio + atv when given separately; when 1400 w was given
to rats pretreated with pio + atv and asa 50 mg/kg, myocardial levels of 15-epi-lxa4 significantly increased, and
were significantly higher than in the group of pio + atv alone group (fig. 4a). our explanation is that removal of
the s-nitrosyl group from cys526 reactivated  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  to produce solely 15-epi-lxa4. then, when the  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  molecules
were not nitrosylated, asa could have a full effect.
when  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is neither acetylated nor nitrosylated, the enzyme is inactive. indeed myocardial levels of pge2 and
15-epi-lxa4 in the rats treated with pio + atv and 1400 w without asa, were comparable to the control group
(fig. 4). interestingly, in this group myocardial 6-keto-pgf1␣ was higher than in the controls. we have previously
shown that atv upregulates pgi2 synthase expression and activity [15]. thus, it is possible that pgi2 is produced,
at least in part, by an interaction between  xxxg1883xxx  and pgi2 synthase. when asa is added to  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  that is already
s-nitrosylated (by pio + atv), the production of both pgh2 [and therefore, pgi2 and pge2 ] and 15-epi-lxa4 is
decreased, supporting our hypothesis that both acetylation and nitrosylation block the enzyme completely. when
 xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is only acetylated, without nitrosylation, the enzyme produces 15-r-hete and therefore 15-epi-lxa4, but
not pgh2 and prostaglandins. thus, when asa is added to animals pretreated with lps, acetylation of the nons-nitrosylated  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  molecules activates them to produce 15-epi-lxa4. in contrast, when most of the  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  is
s-nitrosylated, as occurred in the pio + atv treated animals, the net effect of asa is to completely block the activity
of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx .
we have shown that both pio and atv augment the production of 15-epi-lxa4 in the rat heart. it is still unknown
if these agents augment the production of 15-epi-lxa4 in other tissues, including blood vessels. hence, it is unclear
whether this is a general phenomenon, or unique to the heart. nevertheless, our findings suggest complex interactions
on activation/inactivation pattern of  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx . our data also suggest potential adverse interactions among statins, thiazolidinediones, and high-dose asa. as mentioned above, the induction of 15-epi-lxa4 was greater with aspirin at
81 mg/d than with 325 mg/d in normal human volunteers. at 650 mg/d aspirin did not increase 15-epi-lxa4 at all
[12]. currently, there are no data showing that thiazolidinediones and statins, in doses used in the clinical setting,
augment the production of 15-epi-lxa4 in humans. however, we have previously shown that atv blood levels 16 h
after a third oral dose of atv 10 mg/kg/d (as was used in the present study) are comparable to that seen in humans
treated with atv 80 mg/d [13]. thus, it is possible that such interactions concerning the anti-inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic effects of these drugs exist in the clinical setting. however, in humans the anti-platelet effects of asa,
the lipid-lowering and other pleiotropic effects of statins, and the insulin sensitizing and ppar-␥ activating effects of
thiazolidinediones may surpass the interactions on  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  activity and 15-epi-lxa4 and prostaglandins production.
further studies are needed to explore these potential interactions.
