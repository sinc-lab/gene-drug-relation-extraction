anti– xxxg1180xxx  ( xxxd2570xxx )
therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes

background:  xxxg1180xxx  is a cytokine critically involved in regulating
several aspects of eosinophils including their production, activation, and tissue recruitment. as such,  xxxg1180xxx  may be involved
in the pathogenesis of hypereosinophilic syndromes, a group of
poorly treated diverse disorders characterized by sustained
peripheral blood and/or tissue eosinophilia.
objective: we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a
humanized blocking monoclonal antibody against  xxxg1180xxx 
( xxxd2570xxx ) in patients with several forms of hypereosinophilic syndromes.
methods: we performed an open-label trial of anti– xxxg1180xxx  in which
3 intravenous doses (10 mg/kg, maximum 750 mg) were administered at 4-week intervals to 4 patients with hypereosinophilic syndromes (defined by peripheral blood and/or tissue eosinophilia).
the effects of treatment on safety, eosinophil levels (in peripheral
blood and/or diseased tissue), pulmonary function, and quality of
life were measured over a 28-week period.
results: anti– xxxg1180xxx  was well tolerated in all patients and lowered peripheral blood eosinophil counts despite ongoing systemic glucocorticoid therapy. the decline in circulating
eosinophil counts was sustained for at least 12 weeks after the
last dose of anti– xxxg1180xxx . in addition, anti– xxxg1180xxx  improved clinical
and quality of life measurements. in one patient with striking
tissue eosinophilia (eosinophilic esophagitis), anti– xxxg1180xxx  resulted in a 10-fold reduction in tissue eosinophil levels.
conclusions: these results suggest that anti– xxxg1180xxx  is safe, effective in lowering eosinophil levels, and has potential glucocorticoid-sparing effects in patients with a variety of hyper-

eosinophilic syndromes. as such, anti– xxxg1180xxx  may have significant therapeutic potential for hypereosinophilic syndromes.

hypereosinophilic syndromes (hes) encompass
diverse disorders defined by the accumulation of a large
number of eosinophils in the blood and/or tissues. these
disorders include the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (ihes), which is characterized by elevated levels
of blood eosinophils (>1500 eosinophils/µl) and the
involvement of multiple organs as well as tissue-specific
disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis (ee).1-4 the
ihes typically involves the heart, lung, and skin, whereas ee is part of a series of gastrointestinal-specific
eosinophilic disorders that appear to be occurring with
increasing incidence.4 patients with ee usually have
symptoms that mimic gastroesophageal reflux disease
(gerd), but the disease is primarily resistant to typical
anti-gerd therapy.5 accordingly, the pathogenesis
appears to be markedly different from gerd in that the
esophagus has much higher levels of eosinophils compared with gerd, ph probes are typically normal in ee,
and there is a higher prevalence of the male sex in ee.
additionally, ee is strongly associated with atopic disease; most patients have ige sensitization to a variety of
food and inhaled allergens and coexisting asthma.4
interleukin (il)-5 is a cytokine that has been demonstrated to regulate a variety of processes associated with
eosinophils.6 these include antigen-induced eosinophilia, bone marrow release of eosinophils, eosinophil tissue
survival, and eosinophil activation. based on these properties, primarily demonstrated in rodents, neutralizing
antibodies against murine  xxxg1180xxx  were generated and
shown to be safe and effective in lowering eosinophil
blood and tissue levels in models of asthma and parasitic
infection.7 subsequently, humanized neutralizing antibodies against human  xxxg1180xxx  have been developed, and
early clinical trials in patients with asthma have shown
that anti– xxxg1180xxx  is safe and effective at lowering blood and
sputum eosinophil levels but does not produce the desirable effect on asthma outcome measures.8-10 anti– xxxg1180xxx

may be particularly useful for the treatment of diseases
such as hes, which generally have much higher levels of
eosinophils in the blood and/or tissue compared with
asthma.1 notably,  xxxg1180xxx  has been shown to be overproduced in some patients with ihes and ee11,12 and
involved in the pathogenesis of experimental ee in
mice.13 at present, patients with ihes are often treated
with a variety of potentially toxic and often only partially
effective medications such as glucocorticoids, hydroxyurea, and interferon-alpha. patients with ee are often treated
with allergen avoidance, topical or systemic glucocorticoids, and a variety of anti-gerd medications, but these
approaches are often not successful. more recently, the
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2333xxx  has been
shown to be useful in certain subsets of hes, particularly the myeloproliferative variants resulting from the
fusion of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha
( xxxg1709xxx ) and fip1-like 1 (fip1l1) genes.14,15 based
on the need to develop more effective and safe treatments
for hes, we aimed to test the safety and efficacy of
anti– xxxg1180xxx  in these diseases. because the effect of
anti– xxxg1180xxx  in patients with hes had not been previously
studied and it remained possible that anti– xxxg1180xxx  could be
toxic in patients with markedly elevated levels of
eosinophils, we designed an open-label phase i/ii trial,
designed to primarily assess the safety of this new therapeutic approach.

methods
after local institutional review board and fda approval and
informed consent was obtained, patients with hes involving peripheral blood and/or tissue eosinophilia (18 to 65 years old) were monitored (by complete blood counts and physical examination) at 2- to
4-week intervals for a period of 28 weeks. patients were also evaluated by pulmonary function testing, electrocardiograms, and
echocardiograms at weeks 0, 8, and 20. it is important to note that
the entry criteria for this study permitted enrollment of patients with
severe eosinophilic tissue disease (in the absence of peripheral blood
eosinophilia). as such, for the purposes of this study, patients with
hes included patients with ihes as well as ee. patients with severe
end-organ damage defined as grade iii/iv toxicity on the national
cancer institute clinical toxicity criteria (ctc) were excluded
except for those with stable congestive heart failure. during the runin period (weeks 0 to 8), patients with a history of ihes had their
antieosinophil therapy (eg, glucocorticoids) reduced until eosinophil
levels increased 2-fold over baseline and/or until the absolute
eosinophil levels were >750 cells/µl. the antieosinophil therapy
was gingerly reduced at 2-week intervals, on a case-by-case basis, to
avoid exacerbation of clinical symptoms. this provided reassurance

j allergy clin immunol

that the disease was not in remission and allowed the development of
a moderate eosinophilia for assessment of the efficacy of anti– xxxg1180xxx .
at 8 weeks, patients were intravenously treated with anti– xxxg1180xxx 
( xxxd2570xxx  [ xxxd2570xxx ], provided by glaxosmithkline,
research triangle park, nc) at a dose of 10 mg/kg (maximum, 750
mg), and this was repeated twice at 4-week intervals. after week 8,
patients did not have their conventional (preexisting) antieosinophil
therapy modified. at week 8, before the first infusion, plasma  xxxg1180xxx 
levels and mononuclear cell production of  xxxg1180xxx  (48-hour supernatant
after pha stimulation) was determined (by opteia elisa kit,
according to the manufacturer [bd biosciences pharmingen, san
diego, calif]). the safety of anti– xxxg1180xxx  was determined by recording
all adverse events and scoring them according to the ctc. the
national cancer institute ctc was developed for use in adverse
drug experience reporting to the fda and for publications (see
http:// xxxd3432xxx .info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html for complete information
on the ctc). quality of life (qol) parameters were measured at 2to 4-week intervals, using the validated short form health questionnaire sf-36, and reported as general health scores.16

results
patient 1 was a 48-year-old woman with a 10-year history of ihes with biopsy-proven involvement of the
lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin (eosinophilic cellulitis). her treatment had been primarily oral methylprednisolone and methotrexate with previous trials of
hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, and phototherapy. at the time
of the study, her gastrointestinal symptoms were inactive
and her main target organs were the skin and lungs. during the initial 8 weeks of the protocol, she had an exacerbation of cellulitis requiring escalation of therapy
(methylprednisolone and methotrexate). because of the
medical need to increase therapy, the blood eosinophil
count at week 8 was low.
patient 2 was a 55-year-old man with a 2-year history of
ihes primarily involving biopsy-proven eosinophilic
pneumonia, cellulitis (inactive at the time of study), and
sinusitis/nasal polyposis. he had been treated primarily
with oral prednisone and hydroxyurea. his past medical
history is notable for atopic asthma and rhinitis and
myocardial infarction at the age of 40 years. during weeks
0 to 8, his antieosinophil therapy was not adjusted because
his blood eosinophil counts were already >750 cells/µl.
patient 3 was a 40-year-old woman with a 3-year history of ihes who initially presented with biopsy-proven
acute eosinophilic cardiomyopathy (14 days after commencing l-tryptophan); after stabilization, she had lowgrade congestive heart failure (new york heart association class i; her ejection fraction was 50% at baseline)
and asthma. she has been maintained on oral prednisone
and cardiac medications. during weeks 0 to 8, her
antieosinophil therapy (prednisone) was reduced by a
total of 2.5 mg every other day, which allowed her blood
eosinophil counts to increase >750 cells/µl.
patient 4 was an 18-year-old man who presented with
a diagnosis of ee at 17 years of age. he had a lifelong
history of dysphagia, progressive inability to swallow
solid foods, and was primarily maintained on a liquid
diet. his initial upper endoscopy revealed severe
esophageal narrowing (stricture), marked esophageal

study. after anti– xxxg1180xxx , eosinophil levels plummeted for
the duration of the study. patients reported progressive
improvements in their specific symptoms during the
duration of the study. for example, patient 1 had
improvement in skin pruritis and induration; patient 2
reported remarkable improvement in nasal congestion,
polyposis on physical examination, constitutional symptoms, and exercise tolerance. there were also improvements noted in fev1 measurements and objective qol
measurements (table i). notably, patient 4 reported a
remarkable advancement in his diet; for the first time in
many years he was able to advance his diet and was now
able to swallow solid foods. in addition, before the study,
he was vomiting 3 to 4 times per week because of dysphagia, but after 3 doses of anti– xxxg1180xxx , this was no longer
occurring. subsequently, a repeat endoscopic evaluation
at week 20 revealed that the esophagus was grossly less
narrow and inflamed; this was confirmed by an improved

esophagram (data not shown). importantly, his esophagus contained markedly reduced levels of tissue
eosinophils compared with his pre–anti– xxxg1180xxx  biopsy
specimen. representative photomicrographs of his
esophageal biopsies are shown in fig 2. notably, his
pre–anti– xxxg1180xxx  biopsy samples, consistent with biopsy
samples taken on 3 prior occasions (data not shown), had
abundant eosinophils and free eosinophil granules
detected throughout the hyperplastic mucosa (fig 2, a).
however, after anti– xxxg1180xxx  therapy, only scattered
eosinophils were present in the mucosa (fig 2, b). quantitative analysis of his esophageal biopsy specimens
revealed a statistically significant, >10-fold decrease in
the mean number of tissue eosinophils (fig 3). there was
also a decrease in the maximum number of eosinophils
detected in any high-power field (hpf); before therapy
(week 8), the maximum eosinophil count exceeded 200
cells/hpf, whereas after  xxxg1180xxx , the maximum number was
38 (and this was only noted in a surface exudate).
responsiveness to anti– xxxg1180xxx  occurred in the patients with
both normal and elevated production of  xxxg1180xxx  (table i).
there were no drug-associated adverse events except for
fatigue associated with the first 2 infusions in patient 2
and recurrent infusion-associated headaches in patient 4,
who had a history of headaches.

discussion
in summary, we have shown that anti– xxxg1180xxx  appears to
be safe in 4 patients with diverse manifestations of hes.
in addition, several disease parameters appear to be
improved by anti– xxxg1180xxx  therapy, including peripheral blood

eosinophil counts in all patients, fev1 measurements, a
variety of clinical symptoms, qol measurements, and tissue eosinophilia in 1 patient. however, since this study is
an open-label, noncontrolled trial, definitive proof that
anti– xxxg1180xxx  is responsible for these improvements cannot be
ensured. nevertheless, it is notable that 3 of these patients
(1 through 3) normally maintain an abnormal level of
blood eosinophils, especially at the relatively low doses of
antieosinophil therapy that they were taking between
weeks 8 and 28. furthermore, the decline in blood
eosinophils was noted at week 10 (right after anti– xxxg1180xxx )
and was maintained for the duration of the study, strongly
supporting a causal association between anti– xxxg1180xxx  and the
decrease in blood eosinophilia.
the ability of anti– xxxg1180xxx  to lower peripheral blood
eosinophilia in the 3 patients already taking concurrent
glucocorticoids (table i) suggests that anti– xxxg1180xxx  may
have a steroid-sparing effect in this disease. the profound decline in tissue eosinophilia in patient 4 compared with the only modest decrease of lung eosinophils
in asthmatic patients after anti–il-59 suggests that this
agent may provide relatively more tissue effectiveness in
patients with hes than with asthma. at present, patients
with ee and other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders
have limited medical options (except for glucocorticoids).4 this highlights the importance of further examining the efficacy of anti– xxxg1180xxx  for this series of poorly
treated gastrointestinal diseases. although only one of
the studied patients had detectable increases in  xxxg1180xxx  production (table i), the ability of anti– xxxg1180xxx  to lower
eosinophils in all patients supports a contributory role for
 xxxg1180xxx  in regulating eosinophilia despite the primary
pathogenesis of hes. it will be interesting to determine
the utility of anti– xxxg1180xxx  in patients with hes who harbor
the fip1l1- xxxg1709xxx  fusion gene; notably, patients 1
through 3 did not have a detectable fip1l1- xxxg1709xxx 
gene fusion as assessed by nested reverse-transcriptase
pcr from blood rna (y. yamada and m. e. rothenberg, unpublished results). collectively, these preliminary results suggest that anti– xxxg1180xxx  may have clinical utility for hes, raising the need to further evaluate this compound for these disorders.
