article abstract—objective: to assess early visual impairment related to vigabatrin prospectively in patients with and
without visual symptoms. background: vigabatrin acts as an inhibitor of gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) transaminase. gaba-induced ion transport changes in the retinal pigment epithelium have been described. the electro-oculogram
(eog) is a clinical test that reflects photoreceptor and pigment epithelium function. patients and methods: of the 22
consecutive patients presenting with a history of partial seizures currently treated with vigabatrin, 20 were included in
the study. a complete clinical ophthalmologic and neurologic examination was performed, including static 100-point
perimetry, eog, and electroretinogram (erg). results: in 14 of 20 patients, the light/dark ratio (arden ratio) of the
standard eog was reduced in at least one eye. the a- and b-wave amplitudes and implicit time of the erg were within
the normal range in all patients; however, erg oscillatory potentials could not be recorded in 10 patients. twelve patients
had visual field constriction; five complained of visual symptoms. the most severe visual impairment was observed in
patients treated with both vigabatrin and valproate. conclusions: there is some evidence of outer retinal dysfunction in
the patients treated with vigabatrin. eog, a more sensitive diagnostic tool than erg for screening vigabatrin-treated
patients, also appears to be more specific.

vigabatrin is an antiepileptic drug (aed) that inhibits gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) transaminase,
increasing gaba levels in the brain and retina.1 experimental studies of neurotoxicity indicate that, in
some species treated with vigabatrin, optic tract
damage is present.2 however, a clinical, prospective,
multicenter study evaluating visual evoked potentials did not find any abnormalities,3 suggesting that
vigabatrin is safe in humans. by june 1997, however, visual field abnormalities had been reported
in 92 of a total estimated number of 140,000
vigabatrin-treated patients.4 in all documented
cases,4-10 visual field constriction appeared to be the
common feature. perimetry provides a sensitive procedure for assessing visual function, but interpretation of
therapy-related changes in patients with symptomatic
partial epilepsy is difficult, because visual field abnormalities may be linked to cortical lesions.4 providing
clinicians with additional tools for visual screening of
patients would enable early and accurate diagnosis of
preperimetric impairment.
although pathophysiologic mechanisms remain
unclear, there appears to be some electrophysiologic
evidence for midretinal photoreceptor dysfunction in
patients treated with vigabatrin11 and presenting
with visual complaints. however, the function of the
retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) could also be primarily modified by increased retinal gaba levels, as
it has been demonstrated in vitro.12 in clinical electrophysiology, the electro-oculogram (eog) repre-

sents the major test for evaluating the rpe and the
rpe-photoreceptor outer segment complex.
the purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate whether the eog might provide an additional
diagnostic tool for screening visual functional impairment in patients treated by vigabatrin alone or
in association with other aed.
patients and methods. patients. all consecutive patients were diagnosed with partial seizures and were on
vigabatrin therapy for more than 6 months. patients with
any additional underlying disease that could interfere with
the interpretation of the electrophysiologic results were
excluded from the study. other aed that had been discontinued for more than 6 months were not considered when
evaluating the results.
methods. a complete routine ophthalmologic examination was performed in all patients. visual acuity was determined on a chart first described in the early treatment
of diabetic retinopathy study. anterior segment biomicroscopy and applanation tonometry were performed prior
to mydriasis. diagnostic mydriasis was obtained by local
instillation of  xxxd3450xxx  1% and epinephrine 10%. retinal
biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopic examination of
the retina were performed. two perimetric procedures were
done: a static 100-point 2-db suprathreshold perimetry and a
kinetic goldmann-based computer-assisted visual field examination (moniteur ophtalmologique, lille, france). in kinetic
perimetry, four isopters were tested: 1) the peripheral
isopter (iii 4e goldmann equivalent) was presented at a
speed of 10 °/sec; 2) the two medium isopters, at 5 °/sec (iii
1b and ii 1b goldmann equivalent, respectively); 3) the

central isopter (ii 1d goldmann equivalent); and 4) blind
spot detection (iii 4e goldmann equivalent) at 1 °/sec. visual fields with false positive responses of more than 15%,
false negative responses, or a rate of fixation loss of more
than 20% were not considered for analysis. in addition,
fixation was constantly monitored by an infrared camera
and visualized on a television screen. based on the mean
defect and evaluated by static perimetry, the visual fields
were classified as normal if the mean defect was below 2.5
db, as mildly constricted if the mean defect was between
2.75 db and 5 db, and as severely constricted if the mean
defect was above 5 db.
eog measured the variation of the standing potential
of the eye between light (500 cd/m2) and dark conditions in
accordance with the standards of the international society
for clinical electrophysiology of vision (iscev).13 the patient was instructed to perform target triggered saccades
(in the dark, mean luminance of the target: 40 cd/m2). the
ratio between the light peak and the dark trough (arden
ratio) was determined in both eyes of each patient. in the
laboratory, the lower normal limit of the arden ratio was
at 190%. for this study, patients with an arden ratio below 185% in one eye were considered to have an abnormal
eog. electroretinography (erg) in scotopic (darkadapted) and photopic (daylight) conditions was performed
in accordance with the iscev guidelines using unipolar
corneal electrodes.14 the rod response, maximal response,
oscillatory potentials, single flash cone response, and
flicker responses were recorded subsequently.

linear regression was used to investigate the possibility
of a linear relationship between mean defect determined
by static perimetry and the eog arden ratio. one patient
with hemianopsia and one unable to perform perimetry
were excluded. this analysis was conducted separately for
each eye on a base of 18 patients.
results. a summary of the results is presented in the
table. twenty-two consecutive patients, 11 male and 11
female, with a mean age of 32.7 6 13.8 years (range, 8 to
65), all treated with vigabatrin for more than 6 months,
were screened for the current study.
twenty were included and two were excluded because of
underlying diseases. one male patient had ocular hypertension and pericentral glaucomatous visual field defects,
which would have interfered with the observed perimetric
changes due to vigabatrin therapy. one female patient was
excluded because of underlying diabetic retinopathy
treated by laser, which could modify the results of the
eog. thus, the analysis was conducted on a base of 20
patients.
the mean duration of treatment with vigabatrin was
12 6 4.2 months (range, 10 to 60). all patients had a
history of partial seizures at the time of presentation
(mean duration of follow-up, 22.3 6 19.3 months). three
patients were treated with vigabatrin alone, 16 with vigabatrin and carbamazepine, 2 with vigabatrin and valproate,
and 1 with a combination of vigabatrin, carbamazepine, and
valproate.

figure 1. normal electro-oculogram in
patient 6 (top); abnormal electrooculogram in patient 17 (bottom).

the mean dosages of vigabatrin, carbamazepine, and
valproate were 2,769 6 832 mg (range, 1,500 to 4,000),
1,300 6 424 mg (range, 200 to 1,600), and 1,500 6 866 mg
(range, 500 to 2,000), respectively.
visual symptoms. of the 20 study patients, 5 presented with a history of visual disturbance: two reported
visual field constriction and three had blurred vision. the
remaining 15 patients did not have any visual symptoms.
psychophysical results. visual acuity. visual acuity
was found to be normal at 20/20 in 32 eyes, 20/25 in 3,
20/30 in 4, and 20/100 in 1 eye presenting with amblyopia.
visual field testing. in patient 1, the visual field examination was unreliable in one eye owing to a high rate of
fixation loss. in the other eye, fixation loss was less than
20%, which was nevertheless much higher than in the
other patients, all of whom had reliable visual field results.
therefore, the visual fields of patient 1 were not considered for analysis. five of the 19 patients presented with
severe bilateral visual field constriction. three patients
had bilateral mild constriction; mild visual field constriction was found in only one eye in three additional patients.
one patient had hemianopsia, which could be related to
occipital head injury. in seven patients, no visual field
changes could be detected.
of the 12 patients with visual field constriction, 5 had
visual symptoms. two patients complained of a peripheral
constriction; the other three described their symptoms as
visual blurring.
of the 19 patients who had visual field tests, 11 (58%) had
characteristic visual field constriction in at least one eye.
electrophysiologic tests. electro-oculography. marked
impairment of eog findings could be identified in 14 patients, bilaterally in 13 and unilaterally in 1 (figure 1). the
five patients with severe visual field constriction (excluding the patient with hemianopsia and a normal eog) had
markedly abnormal eog results. thus, major visual field
impairment appeared to be related to a lower eog arden
ratio. however, the reduced eog arden ratio was not necessarily linked to the severity of visual field constriction:
patient 2 had a normal visual field and an eog arden
ratio of 151 in both eyes, whereas patient 17 had severe

visual field constriction and eog arden ratios of 148 and
145. in addition, no linear relationship between static perimetry mean defect and eog arden ratio could be demonstrated (figure 2).
electroretinography. no amplitude or implicit time
changes of a- and b-wave responses were found in any
patient. erg oscillatory potentials (op) were impaired in
both eyes in 10 patients (figure 3); 8 had low eog arden
ratios and 2 had a normal eog. all other erg recordings
in photopic and scotopic conditions were found to be normal in all patients.
results in patients treated with a combination of vigabatrin and valproate. all three patients treated with valproate associated with vigabatrin had visual complaints,
compared with 2 out of 10 patients receiving vigabatrin
alone or a combination of carbamazepine and vigabatrin.
two patients treated with valproate and vigabatrin had a
severe peripheral constriction; the third could not perform
a visual field. among the four patients treated with vigabatrin alone, only one presented with severe visual field
constriction. all three patients currently treated with valproate had abnormal eog recordings.

discussion. in the current study of 20 consecutive
patients treated with vigabatrin for more than 6
months, retinal electrophysiologic impairment could
be demonstrated in 17 patients (85%), consisting of
reduced eog arden ratios (7 patients), altered oscillatory potentials (2 patients), or abnormalities in
both electrophysiologic tests (8 patients). however,
only 12 patients had visual field impairment and
among them only 5 complained of visual disturbance.
eog appeared to be the most sensitive test: abnormal results were found in 14 of 20 patients (70%).
eog arden ratio was clearly below 185% in one eye
of one patient and in both eyes of 13 patients.
the majority of reports of vigabatrin-associated
visual changes do not mention eog testing. harding
reported subnormal eog findings in two cases.4
the most severe visual impairments could be

found in the patients treated with valproate, who all
reported visual symptoms. in addition, these patients demonstrated low eog arden ratios, and in
two out of three patients, no erg op responses
could be recorded. in contrast, only a small percentage of patients not on valproate therapy reported
visual disturbance.
this possible implication of valproate in association with vigabatrin also appeared in the reports of
eke5 and wilson,6 each of whom reported one severe
case. in these patients, vigabatrin and valproate
were associated with marked impairment of eog
findings and structural changes at the level of the
rpe. global retinal function as tested by erg appeared to be normal or subnormal in those patients.
eog is the major test for evaluating the rpe and
the rpe-photoreceptor outer segment complex in patients receiving vigabatrin, even in cases without visual complaints. however, it is not necessarily linked
to visual field constriction.
rpe is actively implicated in generation of the
eog potential. the reduced eog response could be
related to the existence of a gaba transporter located on the apical membrane (subretinal side) of the
rpe,12 as vigabatrin has proven experimentally to

increase gaba levels within the subretinal space.1
as spatial distribution of retinal ionic currents are
not homogenous,15 gaba-induced electrophysiologic
changes might occur predominantly in the peripheral pigment epithelium, thus disturbing peripheral
photoreceptor function. this might account for peripheral visual field loss found in patients treated
with vigabatrin. the hypothesis of primary involvement of the rpe is supported by the association of
normal erg (excepting erg op) and abnormal
eog findings, as encountered in best’s vitelliform
macular dystrophy.16
erg op were not recordable in 50% of patients.
op appear as oscillations on the ascending portion of
the b-wave of the erg (see figure 2). they are believed to be related to the highly gabaergic amacrine cells. they are found to be altered in diseases
affecting the midretinal layers, such as diabetes,17
but also in patients treated only with carbamazepine.4 among our patients, altered erg op was the
only abnormal erg finding detected. in a recent series of 38 patients treated with vigabatrin,11 4 patients with visual symptoms were found to have
abnormal erg oscillatory responses suggestive of
midretinal dysfunction. patients without visual

symptoms were not evaluated. among the 20 current
patients, 5 presented with visual symptoms, no erg
op could be recorded in 4, and in 1 patient, erg op
were found to be normal. asymptomatic patients also
had abnormal clinical, perimetric, and electrophysiologic findings. in all 20 consecutive patients treated
with vigabatrin, either one of the performed visual
fields or electrophysiologic examinations were found
to be pathologic. among the seven patients with abnormal erg op, only four had visual complaints.
although the number of patients included may be too
small to draw general conclusions, testing only
symptomatic patients appears to be insufficient to
detect early retinal changes.
vigabatrin is a useful aed, but our study and
previous reports suggest that it can lead to significant visual impairment. from a physiologic point of
view, there is no reason why the effects of gaba on
the midretinal layers and on the rpe should not be
reversible. a combined effect of increased retinal
concentration of gaba either with a direct toxicity
of vigabatrin or other aed (e.g., valproate) should be
considered as a possible mechanism. the question
remains at what stage of visual impairment discontinuing vigabatrin is indicated. another option
would be to first discontinue other medications such
as valproate in patients with multitherapy regimens.
our results seem to indicate that combination therapy is more toxic than therapy with vigabatrin alone.
the question of reversibility of the observed
changes remains. as mentioned, eog changes could
precede severe visual field impairment in some
cases. a larger population sample and a thorough
long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate the predictive value of the electrophysiologic tests for the
further course of visual impairment.
