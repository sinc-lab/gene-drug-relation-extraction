hemolysis and hemoglobinemia contribute to serious clinical sequelae in hemolytic disorders. in paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria (pnh) patients, hemolysis can contribute to thromboembolism
(te), the most feared complication in pnh,
and the leading cause of disease-related
deaths. we evaluated whether long-term
treatment with the complement inhibitor
eculizumab reduces the rate of te in
patients with pnh. clinical trial participants included all patients in the 3 eculizumab pnh clinical studies, which recruited patients between 2002 and 2005
(n ⴝ 195); patients from these studies

continued treatment in the current multinational open-label extension study.
thromboembolism rate with eculizumab
treatment was compared with the pretreatment rate in the same patients. the te
event rate with eculizumab treatment was
1.07 events/100 patient-years compared
with 7.37 events/100 patient-years
(p < .001) prior to eculizumab treatment
(relative reduction, 85%; absolute reduction, 6.3 te events/100 patient-years). with
equalization of the duration of exposure
before and during treatment for each patient, te events were reduced from
39 events before eculizumab to 3 events

during eculizumab (p < .001). the te event
rate in antithrombotic-treated patients
(n ⴝ 103) was reduced from 10.61 to 0.62
events/100 patient-years with eculizumab
treatment (p < .001). these results show
that eculizumab treatment reduces the
risk of clinical thromboembolism in patients with pnh. this study is registered

introduction
intravascular hemolysis and cell-free plasma hemoglobin have been
implicated in the serious clinical sequelae of various hemolytic disorders.1 hemolysis is the primary clinical manifestation of the uncommon
disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh) and has been
shown to result in chronic disabling morbidities including anemia,
severe fatigue, difficulty in functioning, pain, and thrombosis, all of
which have a major effect on the patient’s quality of life.1-5 paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria is defined by the acquired genetic deficiency
of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)–linked proteins from the surface
of blood cells. the absence of gpi-linked complement regulatory
proteins on pnh erythrocytes renders them susceptible to terminal
complement-mediated hemolysis.
hemolysis most likely contributes to thromboembolism (te) in
pnh, as patients with larger pnh clones have a higher incidence of
te and events have been temporally associated with increased
hemolysis.6-10 although the mechanism is not fully understood,
hemolysis has been implicated in the initiation of platelet
activation and aggregation.1 additional in vitro studies have
suggested that complement may directly activate platelets from
pnh patients.11,12

thromboembolism is the leading cause of mortality in patients
with pnh,2,3,13-17 and an initial thrombotic event increases the
relative risk of death in pnh 5- to 10-fold.15,17 retrospective
studies suggest that, in non-asian patients, te accounts for
approximately 40% to 67% of deaths with known causes.13-17
further, 29% to 44% of patients with pnh have been reported to
suffer from at least one te event in the course of their disease.13-16
in a retrospective study of 67 high-risk patients with pnh not
taking prophylactic anticoagulants, the te rate was estimated at
3.7 events per 100 patient-years (19 te events in 511.5 patientyears), while 0 te events in 117.8 patient-years was observed in a
heterogeneous group of 39 patients with pnh treated with anticoagulants as primary prophylaxis.8 however, in other reports, new
te events as well as progression of existing te have been observed
in patients with pnh, despite the use of anticoagulants and/or
antiplatelet agents.7,14 the risk for fatal hemorrhage in patients with
pnh is significant, in part due to the frequent occurrence of
thrombocytopenia.8,14

terminal complement complex (also called the membrane attack
complex or mac) during complement activation. in clinical
studies to date, eculizumab treatment reduced hemolysis and
improved anemia, fatigue, and quality of life in patients with
pnh.18,19 in this report, we evaluate the effect of long-term
treatment with eculizumab on the prespecified clinical outcome of
te on an intention-to-treat basis in a multinational phase 3
open-label extension study that enrolled patients from 3 independent eculizumab pnh clinical studies (n ⫽ 195). we explore the
robustness of the effect of eculizumab treatment on te in
subgroup analyses.

patients and methods
study design and patients
the number of te events and the incidence rates were determined in
patients from 3 independent parent clinical studies (the phase 2 pilot study
and its extensions,19 the phase 3 triumph study,18 and the phase 3
shepherd study20) and the common phase 3 extension study. all of the
protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each center,
and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the declaration of
helsinki from all patients.
the open-label 12-week phase 2 pilot study was conducted in
11 patients at 2 study centers in the united kingdom.19 patients who
completed the pilot study were eligible to enroll in a one-year extension
study followed by a 2-year extension study. patients 18 years or older who
had received at least 4 red cell transfusions in the previous 12 months and
had a pnh type iii erythrocyte population of at least 10% were eligible to
enroll in the pilot study. patients who were taking stable doses of
immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporin), warfarin, and iron supplements were permitted to continue them during the study. eculizumab was
dosed at 600 mg via intravenous infusion every 7 days for 4 doses, 900 mg
7 days later, and 900 mg every 14 days as a maintenance dose.
the double-blind placebo-controlled 26-week phase 3 efficacy and
safety study (triumph) was conducted in 87 patients in the united states,
europe, australia, and canada.18 patients 18 years or older, with at least
4 red cell transfusions in the previous 12 months, a pnh type iii erythrocyte
population of at least 10% or higher, platelet count of at least 100 ⫻ 109/l
or higher, and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) level of 1.5 times or more of
the upper limit of normal were eligible to enroll. exclusion criteria were
previously described.18 patients who were taking stable doses of immunosuppressive drugs, anticoagulants, and iron supplements were permitted to
continue them during the study. patients were centrally randomized (1:1)
and stratified according to red cell units transfused in the past year to
receive either placebo or eculizumab. study medication was dosed as
follows: eculizumab (600 mg) or placebo via intravenous infusion every
7 (⫾ 2) days for 4 doses; eculizumab (900 mg) or placebo via intravenous
infusion 7 (⫾ 2) days later; followed by a maintenance dose of eculizumab
(900 mg) or placebo via intravenous infusion every 14 (⫾ 2) days, for a
total of 26 weeks of treatment.
the open-label 52-week phase 3 study (shepherd) was conducted in
97 patients in the united states, europe, australia, and canada. patient
characteristics were similar to those of patients treated in triumph except
that the pretreatment transfusion eligibility was adjusted to one or more red
cell transfusions in the previous 24 months and the minimum platelet count
requirement was lowered to 30 ⫻ 109/l; all patients received the identical
eculizumab dose as in the triumph study.
the common open-label 102-week phase 3 extension study is an
ongoing study in which a total of 187 patients have enrolled following
completion of the parent clinical studies (195 patients were enrolled in
parent studies). placebo-treated triumph patients entering the phase 3
extension study received the same eculizumab regimen outlined for the
triumph and shepherd studies. eculizumab-treated patients from the
pilot, triumph, or shepherd studies that entered the phase 3 extension
study continued to receive the 900-mg maintenance dose of eculizumab.
doses of immunosuppressive drugs, anticoagulants, and iron supplements
could be altered at the discretion of the treating physician.

outcome measures
for patients enrolling in the triumph, shepherd, and common phase 3
extension studies, each of the respective protocols specified that all adverse
events and past medical histories were to be evaluated by the principal
investigator to identify clinical te events as defined by the same major
adverse vascular event (mave) criteria in all studies. for each study, the
protocol specified that the principal investigator record the description,
location, method of diagnosis, date of diagnosis, and date resolved for each
thrombosis/mave event in preidentified case report form fields for events
both prior to and during eculizumab treatment. because of the diverse
anatomic locations of thromboses in patients with pnh, multiple diagnostic
tests were used. at least 73% (91/124) of pretreatment maves were
objectively identified, and the most frequent tests were ultrasound, computed tomography (ct) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (mri), and
angiogram. events classified as mave included thrombophlebitis/deep
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, cerebrovascular accident, amputation, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina, renal
vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis,
gangrene, acute peripheral vascular occlusion, sudden death, and a category
for other events. all adverse and past medical history events for patients
enrolling in the pilot study were also evaluated in the same manner, and the
mave criteria were retrospectively applied. all maves were independently source verified. the intention-to-treat analysis was based on all
195 patients who enrolled in all 3 parent clinical studies. the pretreatment
patient-years included the period extending from the earlier of the date of
the diagnosis of pnh or the first thrombotic event to first eculizumab
treatment. pre-eculizumab treatment te events included all events in all
patients prior to enrollment in each of the studies (and during placebo
treatment in triumph). the eculizumab treatment te events included all
events during the period commencing from the first eculizumab dose in the
parent studies until the earlier of the follow-up after the last dose of
eculizumab in the parent or extension studies or the database lock in
november 2006. for the determination of te events in patients receiving
chronic antithrombotic agents, the anatomical therapeutic chemical
classification system was used to identify relevant chronic therapies
including anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents.21
statistical analysis
for each type of te event and for the total group of events collected in the
thrombosis record case report form, the incidence rate was tabulated. rate
of thrombosis per patient year for the pre-eculizumab and the eculizumab
treatment periods was analyzed for the overall patient population and for
each parent clinical study.
te event rates for pre-eculizumab and eculizumab treatment periods
were calculated as the total number of te events divided by the time in
years on a per patient basis. wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the
prespecified analysis on an intention-to-treat basis and for all subanalyses of
the differences between the pre-eculizumab and eculizumab treatment te
events and incidence rates.

consistently reduced hemolysis to near normal levels in patients
from all parent clinical studies, while placebo treatment in the
triumph study showed no effect (figure 1). subsequent eculizumab treatment of placebo-treated patients also resulted in a rapid
and sustained reduction in hemolysis.
prior to receiving eculizumab, application of the specified
mave criteria to the evaluation of medical history events identified 124 te events in the 195 study patients. pretreatment te
events in the study group occurred in both venous (85%) and
arterial (15%) sites (table 2). the most common sites of venous
thrombosis were lower extremity deep veins (18.5%), mesenteric/
splenic veins (18.5%), and hepatic/portal veins (16.9%), while the
most common site of arterial thrombosis was cerebrovascular
accident/transient ischemic attack (13.7%).
main outcome measure. to determine the effect of treatment
with eculizumab on the incidence of te events in pnh, the te
event rates in patients with and without eculizumab treatment were
compared. eculizumab treatment resulted in a reduction in the te
event rate in each of the individual clinical studies (table 3). the
prespecified overall te event rate was reduced from 7.37 events
per 100 patient-years (124 total events) before eculizumab treatment to 1.07 events per 100 patient-years (3 total events) with
eculizumab treatment in the same patients (p ⬍ .001). this represented a relative reduction of 85% and an absolute reduction of 6.3
te events per 100 patient-years. the te event rate in placebotreated patients from the double-blind placebo-controlled triumph study increased from 2.34 events per 100 patient-years
before entering the study to 4.38 events per 100 patient-years
during the 6-month period of placebo treatment.

figure 1. levels of lactate dehydrogenase during
treatment with eculizumab. mean levels of lactate
dehydrogenase reflect the degree of hemolysis in each of
the parent clinical studies from baseline to week 52. the
dashed line indicates the upper limit of the normal range
for lactate dehydrogenase (normal range, 103 to 223 u
per liter). values from the pilot study were normalized to
that of the triumph and shepherd studies and
include data from the subsequent one-year extension
study. in eculizumab-treated patients, the mean level of
lactate dehydrogenase was rapidly reduced to just above
the upper limit of the normal range. in the placebo group,
the mean level of lactate dehydrogenase remained highly
elevated. the arrow depicts the transition of placebotreated patients in triumph to eculizumab treatment in
the phase 3 extension study at which time levels of
lactate dehydrogenase rapidly reduced to near normal
values.

to eliminate a potential bias arising from an unexpected change
in the number of te events immediately preceding trial entry and to
adjust for the difference between the number of patient-years
accumulated in the pre-eculizumab versus the eculizumab treatment periods, the duration of exposure before and during treatment
was equalized for each patient. compared with the number of te
events before treatment, eculizumab treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the overall number of te events from 39 to
3 (p ⬍ .001; table 4). this represented a relative reduction of 92%.
to determine the pre-eculizumab te event rate immediately
preceding eculizumab treatment, the period 12 months before
treatment was examined; the te event rate during this period in the
overall patient population was 17.21 te events per 100 patientyears (191.8 total patient-years), indicating an increase in rate
nearer to initiation of the eculizumab studies.
patients receiving antithrombotics. to evaluate the potential
impact of antithrombotic therapy on te event rates with and
without eculizumab treatment, the te event rate in patients treated
with antithrombotic agents was examined. compared with the
pre-eculizumab te event rate in antithrombotic-treated patients,
eculizumab treatment resulted in a reduction in the te event rate in
each of the individual clinical studies and a significant reduction in
the overall te event rate (table 5). the te event rate in patients
receiving antithrombotics was 10.61 events per 100 patientyears before eculizumab and was reduced to 0.62 events per
100 patient-years in the same patients during eculizumab treatment
(p ⬍ .001). this represented a relative reduction of 94% and an
absolute reduction of 9.99 te events per 100 patient-years. when

discussion
intravascular hemolysis and the release of red blood cell hemoglobin have been linked to the occurrence of thrombosis and other
serious morbidities in various hemolytic disorders.1 thromboembolism is a serious and life-threatening complication in pnh and the
single most frequent cause of death in patients. prospective
analysis of patient data pooled from 3 clinical studies and a
common extension study enabled us to carry out a comparison of
the te event rate in nontreated and in eculizumab-treated patients
with pnh. this analysis demonstrates that eculizumab treatment
resulted in a dramatic reduction in the te event rate from 7.37 to
1.07 te events per 100 patient-years. the reduction in the number
of te events and the te incidence rates with eculizumab were
robust and were not diminished in several clinically relevant
sensitivity analyses. interestingly, te events in this study occurred
in both venous and arterial systems as has been previously

described,7,13,17 confirming that te is not restricted to the venous
system in pnh.
the te event rate without eculizumab of 7.37 events per
100 patient-years in our patient population, which comprised
195 patients, is more than twice that of the te event rate published
previously for 67 high-risk patients in a single-center descriptive
study.8 the current te event assessment was systematic, protocol
specified, and performed on a multicenter, multinational, and
controlled basis. while most patients in the current study had large
populations of pnh granulocytes, te was also observed before
eculizumab in patients who would be expected to have less severe
disease with smaller pnh cell populations (⬍ 50%), as has been
previously reported.7,8 the observed variability in the preeculizumab te event rates among the individual studies may be
related in part to the different inclusion criteria. for example, the
higher pretreatment te event rate in the shepherd study could
reflect inclusion of patients with lower platelet counts that may be
due to defective hematopoiesis or platelet consumption as a result
of hypersplenism associated with previous thrombosis in the portal
system.22 despite heterogeneity in the individual prestudy te event
rates, eculizumab treatment consistently resulted in a marked
reduction in this rate in each individual study. it is important to note
that the te event rate was higher in the 12-month period
immediately preceding eculizumab treatment. the increasing te
event rate of 17.21 events per 100 patient-years observed in the
study population immediately prior to trial enrollment may indicate
that the overall event rate of 7.37 te events per 100 patient-years
may have been diminished due to the loss of patients who had
suffered fatal te events and did not survive to enroll in the clinical
trials or the progression of underlying disease.
the observed reduction of te events during eculizumab
treatment is unlikely to be due to improvements in patient care or
more aggressive antithrombotic therapy leading up to and during
the clinical studies since the te event rate did not decrease in the
period of time immediately preceding study enrollment or during
the study in placebo-treated patients. the pre-eculizumab te event
rate during the 12-month period just prior to study initiation was
markedly elevated, reaching a rate of 17.21 events per 100
patient-years. in addition, the te event rate in placebo-treated
patients from the double-blind placebo-controlled triumph
study increased from 2.34 events per 100 patient-years before
entering the study to 4.38 events per 100 patient-years during the
6-month evaluation period. further, initiation of antithrombotic
therapy during eculizumab treatment did not contribute to the

observed reduction in te events; only 3 of 195 patients commenced antithrombotic treatment after eculizumab initiation.
three te events occurred in patients during eculizumab
treatment: a deep vein thrombosis occurred after 1 year of
eculizumab therapy in an anticoagulated patient with no history of
te; a pulmonary embolism occurred within 2 months of starting
eculizumab therapy in a nonanticoagulated patient with a history of
2 previous te events (pulmonary embolism and deep vein
thrombosis); and a deep vein thrombosis occurred within 6 months
of starting eculizumab therapy in a nonanticoagulated patient with
a history of 1 te event (deep vein thrombosis). hemolysis was
effectively controlled in all 3 patients during eculizumab treatment.
anticoagulation is commonly used in patients with pnh who
have a history of thrombosis and has been proposed as a prophylaxis for higher risk patients.2,8 however, physicians have reported
new te events and advancing te in patients with pnh while on
antithrombotics.7,8,14 in addition, hemorrhagic adverse events are a
significant risk of chronic anticoagulant therapy particularly as
some patients are thrombocytopenic, and therefore primary prophylaxis may be contraindicated in this patient population. chronic
anticoagulation was shown to be associated with an overall risk of
7.6 bleeding complications per 100 patient-years with the risk
increasing to 11.0 bleeding complications per 100 patient-years
during the first 90 days of treatment.23 the risk for hemorrhage
with anticoagulant therapy in patients with pnh has been reported
to be approximately 5% or higher, including fatal hemorrhage.8,14
in the present study, the pre-eculizumab te event rate remained
elevated in patients treated either therapeutically or prophylactically with antithrombotics, such as warfarin, suggesting that such
therapies were not adequate to prevent te in this patient population. by contrast, chronic administration of eculizumab, a therapy
that targets the underlying hemolysis in pnh, significantly reduced
the overall te event rate. whether anticoagulants can be reduced or
eliminated in patients with pnh receiving eculizumab is the
subject of future investigation. further, while eculizumab discontinuation in 16 study patients has not been associated with
hemolysis above pretreatment levels and concomitant thrombosis,
patients should be monitored following eculizumab
discontinuation.24
the pretreatment te event rate was elevated, and substantial
improvement with eculizumab was observed, even in patients who
would be expected to have less severe disease. the te event rate
was reduced from 10.76 events per 100 patient-years before
treatment to 2.88 events per 100 patient-years during eculizumab in
patients with lower levels of baseline hemolysis (lowest pretreatment ldh quartile). similarly, the te event rate was reduced from

4.87 events per 100 patient-years before treatment to 0.00 events
per 100 patient-years during eculizumab in patients with minimal
pretreatment anemia (0 or 1 transfusion in the year prior to
eculizumab treatment). taken together, these data demonstrate that
thrombotic risk is elevated in patients who would be expected to
have less severe disease and the benefit of eculizumab in this
patient population is maintained.
hemolysis is characteristic of various hemolytic diseases and
has been reported to contribute to serious clinical consequences. in
patients with pnh, thromboembolic events have been linked to
hemolysis, potentially through the buildup of cell-free plasma
hemoglobin.1,6-9 the effect of free hemoglobin on platelet function
and hypercoagulability and the recognized increase in thrombotic
tendencies in pnh may be largely due to its ability to scavenge
 xxxd2738xxx .25-32 other potential mechanisms of thrombosis in pnh
include the generation of procoagulant platelet microvesicles due
to the absence of the terminal complement inhibitor cd59, and the
interaction of red cell microvesicles and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor.11,12,33,34 terminal complement inhibition
with eculizumab would be expected to have a beneficial effect on
te occurring through any of these mechanisms.
the current findings show that long-term administration of
eculizumab, in a diverse population of patients, including patients
who would be expected to have less severe disease, substantially
reduces the risk of thrombosis. in clinical studies to date, eculizumab therapy has controlled hemolysis, improved anemia and
quality of life, and appeared to be safe and well tolerated.18,19,35
considering that thrombosis has been demonstrated to cause the
majority of deaths in pnh, it is reasonable to expect that
eculizumab treatment, by decreasing the risk of thrombosis, may
increase the life expectancy of these patients.
