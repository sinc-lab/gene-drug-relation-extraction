abstract: the kringle 2 (k2) module of human  xxxg1775xxx  (pgn) binds l-lysine and analogous
zwitterionic compounds, such as the antifibrinolytic agent trans-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
(amcha). far-uv cd and nmr spectra reveal little conformational change in k2 upon ligand binding.
however, retarded 1h-2h isotope exchange kinetics induced by amcha indicate stabilization of the
k2 conformation by the ligand. assessment of secondary structure content from cd spectra yields ∼26%
beta-strand, ∼13% beta-turn, ∼15% 31-helix, and ∼6% 310-helix. the nmr solution conformation of the k2
domain complexed to amcha has been determined [heavy atom rmsd ) 0.49 ( 0.09 å (backbone) and
1.02 ( 0.08 å (all)]. the k2 molecule has overall dimensions of ∼34.5 å × ∼33.4 å × ∼22.7 å.
analogous with the polypeptide outline of homologous domains, k2 contains three short antiparallel
beta-sheets (paired strands 15-16/20-21, 24-25/48-49, and 62-64/72-74) and four defined beta-turns
(residues 6-9, 16-19, 53-56, and 67-70). consistent with the cd analysis, albeit novel in the context
of kringle folding, the nmr structure reveals an unpaired beta-strand structured by residues 30-32, a turn
of 310-helix comprising residues 38-41, and a 31-helix for residues 21-24 and 74-79. we also identify
alignable 31-helices in previously reported homologous kringle structures. rather high order parameter s2
values (〈s2〉 ∼ 0.85 ( 0.04) characterize the k2 backbone dynamics. the lowest flexibility is observed
for the two inner loop segments of residues 51-63 and 63-75 (〈s2〉 ∼ 0.86-0.87 ( 0.03). overhauser
connectivities reveal close hydrophobic contacts of the ligand ring with side chains of tyr36, trp62, phe64,
trp72, and leu74. in most k2 structures, the n atom of amcha places itself ∼3.9 and ∼4.4 å from the
anionic groups of glu57 and asp55, respectively, while its carboxylate group, h-bonded to the tyr36 side
chain oheta, ion-pairs the arg71 guanidinium group. consistent with the preference of k2 for binding
5-aminopentanoic acid over  xxxd146xxx , the positions of the ionic centers within the k2 binding
site approach each other ∼1 å closer relative to what is observed in lysine binding sites of homologous
pgn modules.

 xxxg1775xxx  (plm)1 and its proenzyme,  xxxg1775xxx  (pgn),
interact noncovalently with a variety of proteins, including
the substrates fibrin and fibrinogen (1), the inhibitor r2antiplasmin (2), the histidine-rich glycoprotein (3), and
 xxxg2278xxx  (4). these interactions are mediated via
lysine binding sites (lbs) in the kringle modules of pgn. in
addition, complexation of lysyl-type ligands relaxes the
compact conformation of the pgn molecule (reviewed in ref
5). therefore, kringles play crucial roles both in substrate
recognition by and in determining the conformation of pgn,
thus regulating its susceptibility to proteinase activators. in
addition, pgn binding sites have been identified on surfaces
of a number of cells such as platelets and endothelial cells
(6, 7). in this context, the isolated modules kringle 1 (k1),
k2, k3, k4, and k5 variously exhibit inhibitor activity,
similar to that of  xxxg1775xxx , against basic fibroblast growth

75 disulfide bond pattern.2 structure elucidation of ligandcomplexed kringle modules (14-18) as well as ligandbinding experiments with wild-type (wt) (19-22) and sitespecific mutated domains (23-25) have led to the localization
of amino acid residues relevant for the interaction with
dipolar, lysyl-type ligands. in particular, it is now well
established that in k1, k2, k4, and k5 the ligand’s amino
group ion-pairs acidic residues at positions 55 and 57 while
its carboxylate group variously interacts with arg71 (k1 and
k4), arg35 (k1), or lys35 (k4). in k3, a lys residue occupies
position 57; as a consequence, k3 does not interact with
lysine-type zwitterions (26, 27). furthermore, the ligand
hydrocarbon moiety establishes van der waals contact with
aromatic residues phe36 (k1 and k5), trp62, tyr64/phe64, and
tyr72/trp72 (k1, k4, and k5), thus stabilizing the interaction.
all the homologous lysine-binding kringles bind the pgn
n-terminal loop segment, implying potential role(s) in
determining the macrostructure of glu1-pgn (28, 29).
however, with regard to their selectivity for linear omega-aminocarboxylic acids, k1, k4, and k5 exhibit the strongest
affinity for  xxxd146xxx  (6-aha), while k2 shows
a preference for 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-apa), an analogue
with a shorter hydrocarbon chain (30). this suggests a
structurally different array of residues at the k2 lbs.
the pgn k2 and k3 domains stand out among homologous
motifs found in kringle-containing proteins in that they are
cross-linked via a disulfide bond which involves cys residues
at positions 4 (k2) and 43 (k3). this generates a k2+3
“supermodule” (27) in which one kringle has the ability to
bind lysine (k2) while the other does not (k3), hinting at a
unique, as yet uncharacterized, functionality for the coupled
pair. in this paper, the solution conformation of the pgn k2
complexed to the antifibrinolytic drug trans-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (amcha) is described, novel
nmr evidence for a direct involvement of the glu57 and
arg71 side chains in ligand complexation is presented, the
occurrence of 31-helix is reported, and the k2 backbone
dynamics are discussed. our study represents a first step
toward a functional-structural characterization of the k2+3
supermodule and of interactions between the two domains.

reported elsewhere (26, 30). 15n labeling of the domain was
achieved in m9 medium (ph 7.4) supplemented with 5 mg
of fecl3‚6h2o, 1 mg of thiamine, and 10 g of glucose per
liter (31). for 13c labeling, 2 g of [13c6]-d-glucose (99 at. %
13c, isotec inc., miamisburg, oh) was employed per liter.
the purity and correct folding of the isolated r-k2 were
verified by sds-page and 1h nmr spectroscopy, respectively.
cd analysis of k2. circular dichroism (cd) spectra were
acquired at 37 °c on a jasco j-715 spectropolarimeter using
a 0.5 cm cell. r-k2 was dissolved at a concentration of 2.25
µm and the ph adjusted to 5.13. spectra were recorded in
the 178-260 nm wavelength range and averaged over five
scans at a speed of 20 nm/min and 0.5 nm resolution. spectra
in the presence of amcha were recorded with a 200-fold
molar excess of ligand. k2 secondary structure content was
assessed with the program cdsstr version 1.8 (32).
nmr sample preparation. unlabeled or 15n-enriched r-k2
was dissolved in 300 µl of 90% 1h2o/10% 2h2o (99.996
at. % 2h, isotec inc.) at a concentration of ∼3.2 mm. in the
case of the 13c-labeled protein, the concentration was ∼1.2
mm. the ph* was adjusted to 5.12 by addition of 2hoac
or nao2h. to study the amcha-complexed k2, ligand was
added to protein samples to achieve a 1:3 r-k2:amcha
molar concentration ratio.
nmr spectroscopy and data processing. data from all
nmr experiments were recorded in quadrature, at 37 °c,
on bruker avance drx spectrometers equipped with tripleresonance z-gradient probes. homonuclear two-dimensional
spectra were acquired at 600 mhz using tppi. for cosy
(33) and double-quantum-filtered cosy (34) experiments,
water suppression was achieved by selective low-power
irradiation during the 0.8 s relaxation delay between scans.
data from tocsy experiments were recorded with mlev17,
isotropic mixing times (taumix) of 35 and 75 ms (35). data
from noesy experiments (36) were collected with six taumix
values, set within the range of 60-350 ms. for both noesy
and tocsy, the 3-9-19 pulse sequence with gradients was
used for water suppression (37). data were processed with
felix version 95 (molecular simulations inc., san diego,
ca). time domain data in t1 were zero-filled to 4k data
points; resolution enhancement was accomplished via straight
(cosy) or 45°-shifted squared (tocsy and noesy) sinebell window functions along both dimensions.
15n-edited nmr spectra were acquired at 500 mhz. a
sensitivity-enhanced version of the two-dimensional 1h15n hsqc experiment (38) was carried out according to ref
39. water suppression was achieved with gradients via the
3-9-19 pulse sequence. linear prediction to 256 complex
points was implemented along t1; 45°-shifted squared sinebell window functions were applied along both t1 and t2. 15nedited noesy-hsqc spectra (40, 41) were acquired with
taumix of 75 and 150 ms and 15n-edited tocsy-hsqc spectra
(42) with mlev17, taumixs of 35 and 75 ms. data were
collected in the phase-sensitive mode using tppi for t1 (1h)
and echo/antiecho-tppi gradient selection (43) for t2 (15n).
15n-edited hnha (44) and hnhb spectra (45,46) were
acquired in the states phase-sensitive mode along both t1
(1h) and t2 (15n).
13c- and 15n-edited spectra were recorded at 600 mhz.
quadrature in t1 (1h and 13c) and t2 (15n) of the hnca (47,
48), hn(co)ca (49), and hcc(co)nh (50-52) experi-

 xxxg1775xxx  kringle 2 structure and dynamics
ments was achieved via the states-tppi and echo/antiechotppi gradient selection mode, respectively. data from the
latter experiment were recorded with taumix of 12 and 20 ms
via the dipsi-2 scheme (53) for 13c isotropic mixing. the
waltz-16 scheme (54) was used in all experiments for
15n decoupling during acquisition. three-dimensional data
were linearly predicted to 128 (t1) and 64 (t2) complex points,
respectively, and 45°- or 60°-shifted (hnha, hnhb)
squared sine-bell functions were applied along all three
dimensions. the matrix size for three-dimensional spectra
was 512 × 512 × 128. 1h chemical shifts are referred to
the tsp resonance using  xxxd1904xxx  as the internal standard
(55). 13c and 15n chemical shifts also are relative to tsp
(56).
hydrogen exchange experiments. 1h-2h exchange kinetics of backbone amide protons was monitored by recording
a series of 1h-15n hsqc spectra at 22 °c at various times
after dissolving the sample in 2h2o, ph* 5.12. intervals
between spectra were initially 40 min (10 spectra) and were
extended to 165 min (last 10 spectra). additional data were
acquired after 7 and 14 days.
torsion angle restraints and stereospecific assignment.
values for hn-hr spin-spin coupling constants (3jhnr)
were obtained from the hnha experiment via analysis of
diagonal to cross-peak intensity ratios (44). to 3jhnr values
of g8 (22 residues) and e6 hz (22 residues), phi torsion angles
were assigned to lie within ranges of -160° to -80° and
-90° to -30°, respectively (57, 58). stereospecific assignments of hbeta protons and identification of 35 chi1 torsion angles
were achieved on the basis of 3jrbeta and 3jnbeta data extracted
from cosy and hnhb experiments, respectively, and hrhbeta and hn-etabeta nuomicronepsilon intensities obtained from a (twodimensional) noesy spectrum with a taumix of 120 ms.
interproton distance restraints. noe connectivities (2093)
were assigned in two-dimensional noesy experiments with
the k2-amcha complex. among these, 1320 unambiguously assigned intra-k2 noesy cross-peaks were selected
and interproton distances3 estimated from the buildup of
spectra recorded at taumix of 60 and 90 ms, calibrated according
to fixed interproton distances. a total of 568 intraresidue,
295 sequential, 119 short-range (1 < |i - j| < 5), and 338
long-range (5 e |i - j|) distance restraints were thus obtained
(figure 1a). upper and lower limits were set at (20% of
the calculated distance, respectively. an upper limit of 6 å
was set for distances derived from cross-peaks that could
be observed only with long taumix (250 and 350 ms). thirteen
supplementary distance restraints were introduced to account
for seven backbone co‚‚‚hn h-bonds involving residues
located in beta-sheet regions. twenty-eight intermolecular k2amcha distance constraints were derived from noesy
spectra recorded for k2 in the presence of 3- and 15-fold
molar ligand excesses.
structure calculation. structures were computed using
x-plor 3.851 (59) according to a distance geometry/
regularization protocol (60, 61). starting from noe data for
the k2-amcha complex, 150 k2 substructures were
generated using the x-plor force field “parallhdg.pro”
which imposes idealized covalent geometry. chirality and
planarity were introduced during 4.5 ps of high-temperature
3 among these, 196 are backbone-backbone, 612 backbone-side
chain, and 512 side chain-side chain.

reference, the k2 secondary structure is outlined at the top.

(1500 k) molecular dynamics (md) simulation. further
conformational space was sampled by simulated annealing
over a period of 6 ps and stepwise temperature changes from
1500 to 100 k. the latter was followed by 200 steps of
energy minimization (em). a square-well potential was used
for the noe energy; the vdw energy was modeled by a repel
function of a variable force constant. in the first round of
structure refinement, noes accounting for disulfide bonds
were introduced by setting the sgamma‚‚‚sgamma distance between
paired cys residues to 2.02 å. a 6 ps md trajectory was
calculated during which the temperature was lowered from
1000 to 100 k, followed by 200 steps of em. after the sgamma
atoms had been linked covalently, the refinement protocol
was repeated via a 6 ps md run that involved cooling from
600 to 100 k. good convergence was indicated by the heavy
atom rmsds for all residues within the kringle proper, namely,
within the stretch of cys1-cys80: 0.96 ( 0.10 å (for the
backbone, 0.43 ( 0.09 å), relative to the mean (table 1).
the structure of the k2-amcha complex was computed
on the basis of 28 intermolecular noe distance constraints
(table 2), introduced after interactively docking the ligand
in the vicinity of the k2 lbs within the generated kringle
structures described above. md calculations were carried out
for 3 ps as described above. the force field incorporated
energy terms for bonds, angles, impropers, noes, dihedrals,
and h-bonds as well as 28 intermolecular noes. electrostatic
and vdw interactions were modeled by switching functions
effective at a radius between 5 and 9 å. the structures were

distances calculated from the slopes of noesy cross-peak buildups
determined from noesy spectra with taumix of 60 and 90 ms. intraresidue
trp indole ring protons and gly hr2- xxxd2729xxx  noe buildups were used
for calibration. noesy spectra were acquired at amcha:k2 molar
ratios of 3:1 and 15:1.

powell energy minimized in 600 steps. except for one, the
convergence of the calculated structures was closely similar
to those computed for the k2 structure when ignoring noes
to the ligand (table 1).
further refinement was achieved using the charmm 23.2
program and charmm22 force field (quanta96 software
package, molecular simulations inc.). after 500 steps of
adopted-basis newton-raphson em, a 0.96 ps md run was
implemented during which the temperature changed from
600 to ∼0 k, followed by another round of em. active
energy terms were the same as in the x-plor calculation.
seventy-five structures were selected on the basis of their
total energy value and ramachandran plot, and subjected to
another round of md/em calculations. in the subsequent,
final md/em run, further improvement of the ramachandran
phi versus psi map resulted for 20 structures selected on the
basis of their total energy via a statistical analysis using
programs procheck-nmr version 3.4.4 (62), molmol
version 2.6 (63), and x-plor 3.851. among these, 61.3%

of the residues fell in the energetically most favored, 35.9%
in the additionally allowed, 2.8% in the generously allowed,
and none in the disallowed areas (62).
figure 1b illustrates the average rmsd sequence profile of
backbone and all heavy atoms. in the final charmm md/
em run, the upper and lower limits of the distance restraints
were set by adding and subtracting, respectively, 30% of the
estimated distance. for the noe distance and the experimental dihedral angle restraints, rmsds amount to 0.062 (
0.005 å and 0.66 ( 0.55°, respectively (table 1). while
the covalent geometry of the structures was not strictly
conserved with the charmm22 force field, as indicated
by an increased rmsd for bonds, angles, and impropers from
their idealized values (table 1), all the structures exhibit a
large negative lennard-jones energy (average of -371.6 (
6.7 kcal mol-1), indicative of favorable nonbonded contacts.
analysis of secondary structure was assisted by use of the
program xtlsstr (64). all calculations were carried out on
a silicon graphics o2 workstation equipped with a mips
r5000 processor.
backbone dynamics. dynamic behavior was assessed by
measuring 15n t1 and t2 relaxation, as well as the heteronuclear 1h-15n noe (xnoe) of amide nh groups. experiments were performed at 500 mhz as described previously
(65). for the evaluation of t1, nine tau delays were applied
ranging from 5 to 1503 ms; for t2, 12 tau delays between 16
and 490 ms were applied. the delay between scans was set
to 1.2 and 5 s in the t1/t2 and xnoe experiments,
respectively. the t1 and t2 relaxation data were fitted to
exponential decay curves using felix version 97 (molecular
simulations inc.). 1h-15n noes were obtained from the
peak height ratios of two 1h-saturated and two unsaturated
xnoe experiments. relaxation data were analyzed on the
basis of the extended model-free approach (66, 67) and the
model-free version 3.0 software (68). the effective isotropic
rotation correlation time, tauc, was estimated from the averaged
r2/r1 ratio. five models were tested against the experimental
data optimizing the following free parameters: (1) generalized order parameter s2, (2) s2 and the internal time scale
parameter taue, (3) s2 and the chemical exchange parameter

hnca (figure 2) experiments. except for pro imino and
the thr-4, ser-3, and tyr36 amide groups, all backbone 1h
and 15n resonances were assigned (figure 3). side chain 1h
signals were sorted via two-dimensional tocsy, cosy,
three-dimensional 1h-15n tocsy-hsqc, and hcc(co)nh experiments. aromatic and his imidazole spin systems
had been identified previously (30). resonance assignments
are provided as supporting information.
the hdelta resonances of pro residues at positions 38, 42,
54, 61, 68, and 78 yielded characteristic noesy cross-peaks
with the hr resonances of their corresponding preceding
residues. for pro residues at positions 42, 54, and 61,
additional hdelta-hn(i-1) noes were identified. such patterns
are indicative of a trans conformation for the x-pro peptide
bonds. in the case of pro30, an noe between its hr and the
hn of ser29 was detected, whereas a connectivity between
ser29 backbone protons and the pro30 hdelta was not apparent,
consistent with a cis ser29-pro30 peptide bond.
amcha binding. among several small molecule zwitterionic ligands, amcha exhibits the strongest interaction
with the pgn k2 (ka ∼ 7.2 mm-1) (30). hsqc spectra reveal
amcha-induced shifts of k2 backbone and side chain 1h15n resonances, with the segment asp55-leu58 being the
most sensitive to ligand binding (figure 3). noteworthy is
the fact that asp55 and glu57 nhs display ∆deltah values of
∼0.34 and ∼0.26 ppm and ∆deltan values of ∼1.46 and ∼1.65
ppm, respectively. neighboring residues arg56 and leu58 also
exhibit significantly perturbed resonances: ∆deltah ∼ 0.20 and
0.39 ppm and ∆deltan ∼ 0.77 and 2.81 ppm, respectively. other
residues exhibiting distinct amcha-induced resonance

biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 48, 1999 15745
shifts are glu7, cys22, ala32, his33, ile37, and leu74 (|∆deltah|
> 0.13 or |∆deltan| > 0.4 ppm).
as for side chains, the trp62 and trp72 aromatic nh1
resonances are markedly perturbed by amcha: ∆deltah ∼ 0.64
and 0.23 ppm and ∆deltan ∼ 0.14 and 0.42 ppm, respectively.
most interestingly, ∆deltah ∼ 1.07 ppm and ∆deltan ∼ 0.87 ppm
are observed for the arg71 nh resonances.
hydrogen exchange. the kinetics of k2 1h-2h exchange
was monitored via two-dimensional 1h-15n hsqc experiments. in the absence of ligand, 29 nh cross-peaks remained
in the spectrum 8 h after dissolving the protein in 2h2o (ph*
5.12 and 22 °c), including the trp25 nh1 (table 3). after
an additional 80 h, 11 remained, five being rather weak. in
the presence of amcha, 29 backbone amide nh crosspeaks exhibited considerable intensities after 8 h (table 3).
nh signals from trp25, asn53, and trp62 side chains also
remained detectable. after 186 h, 22 cross-peaks were still
visible in the hsqc spectrum, which was reduced to 17
within the following 144 h. the latter stemmed all from
backbone amides except for the one which arises from the
trp25 nh1. the generalized retardation of the exchange
kinetics induced by amcha indicates that the ligand
stabilizes the k2 structure.
cd analysis. far-uv cd spectra of k2 in the absence
and presence of ligand (figure 4) reveal close conformational
similarity between ligand-free and amcha-complexed k2.
the negative ellipticity near 200 nm is evidence for irregular
coil structures and distorted or short beta-strands (69). within
the 212-236 nm range, the positive ellipticity is indicative
of coil structure. secondary structure content was estimated
via the variable selection method (32). for the uncomplexed
k2, the analysis yielded ∼23% beta-strand, ∼14% beta-turns,
∼14% 31-helix, and ∼6% 310-helix. this is comparable to
∼26% antiparallel beta-strand, ∼13% beta-turns, ∼15% 31-helix,
and ∼6% 310-helix derived for the amcha-bound k2. no
r-helix was content was indicated for either.
kringle 2 structure. superposed backbone structures are
illustrated in figure 5a. the backbone heavy atom rmsd
profile (figure 1b) reveals that residues in the vicinity of
cys22, cys51, and cys63 are the better defined ones. the latter
participate in the cys22-cys63 and cys51-cys75 disulfide
bridges, where the cys63 and cys75 sgamma atoms are separated
by ∼3.1 å and those from cys22 and cys51 by ∼4.7 å. these
two cystines are buried within the kringle core and juxtapose
at an angle of ∼70° relative to each other, thus constraining
the domain to a compact folding. the resulting structure has
dimensions of ∼34.5 å × ∼33.4 å × ∼22.7 å.
the domain disulfide pattern and backbone folding defines
seven loops conformed by residues cys1-ile13, ser14-cys22,
cys22-tyr36, ile37-cys51, cys51-cys63, cys63-cys75, and
cys75-cys80. high structural resolution is obtained for the
loop segments of residues cys22-tyr36, cys51-cys63, and
cys63-cys75, with backbone rmsds in the range of 0.310.35 å. the least defined area of the molecule is the cys1ile13 loop, with a backbone rmsd of 0.71 ( 0.18 å. this is
consistent with the finding that the tyr9 aromatic protons
exhibit multiple sets of nmr resonances, a reflection of a
slow, local conformational exchange, as previously observed
for the pgn k1 and k4 (16, 70), the tpa k2 (14), and the
upa kringle (71). ser14-cys22, ile37-cys51, and cys75-cys80

loops exhibit an intermediate level of definition (rmsd ∼
0.39-0.52 å).
pairwise alignment of the n, cr, and c′ backbone skeleton
of k2 against those reported for the k1, k4, and k5 crystal
structures (15, 17, 72) yields averaged rmsds of ∼1.54,
∼1.63, and ∼1.58 å, respectively (figure 6). a most
conspicuous difference is for the his3-ser5 stretches. in k2,

the segment contains cys4 (mutated to gly in our r-k2),
which forms an interkringle disulfide bond with cys43 of
k3. thus, it is noteworthy that in the r-k2 that is investigated,
the gly4  xxxd2729xxx  is exposed, which would suggest a similar
situation for the cys4 side chain in k2, available for
generating the interkringle cysteine bridge in the k2+3
supermodule. furthermore, the segment of residues lys40-

 xxxg1775xxx  kringle 2 structure and dynamics

biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 48, 1999 15747
characterized by short hr(i)-hn(i+2,i+3) and hr(i)-hsc(i+3)
distances (76), a 310-helix turn, outlined by residues pro38phe41, was identified from the noesy data. this concurs
with the cd analysis which suggests a 310-helix content of
∼6%.

figure 4: far-uv cd spectra of kringle 2: ligand free (a) and in
the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of amcha (b). spectra
were recorded on a 2.25 µm r-k2 solution in 1h2o at ph 5.13 and
37 °c. each spectrum represents an average of five scans.

asn43 in k2 shows a more open conformation than the
corresponding segment in k1, k4, and k5. interestingly, the
backbone dynamics analysis (discussed below) points to
increased mobility for the phe41 site, which would imply a
relatively higher flexibility for this stretch.
three short antiparallel beta-sheets are found in k2 on the
basis of backbone atom 1h-1h noes.4 these pair strands
lys15-thr16 to leu20-glu21, ala24-trp25 to lys48-asn49,
and trp62-phe64 to trp72-leu74 which are composed of
two-, two-, and three-residue pairs, respectively (figure 5b).
beta-sheet amides are characterized by spin-spin couplings
(3jhnr) of g7 (58), as determined for residues 15, 16, 20,
49, 62, and 73 (figure 7). in k2, ∼80% of the 13cr
resonances arising from beta-sheet residues exhibit characteristic
high-field shifts, consistent with statistical criteria (73).
expectedly, residues within the beta-sheets also exhibit retarded
peptidyl amide 1h-2h exchange rates (figure 7). thus, in
the pgn k2, about 18% of the sequence is in beta-sheets. an
unpaired beta-strand, structured by the pro30-ala32 segment,
is variously identified in 12 of the 20 structures. when
combined, the nmr structural data compare reasonably well
with the ∼26% beta-strand content estimated from the far-uv
cd spectra.
poly(pro)ii-like 31-helix, also indicated by the cd data,
was identified in k2 on the basis of two criteria: (a) phii ∼
-78° and psii ∼ 149° (74) and (b) 100° < taui < 140° and
-150° < zetai < -80° (75), where taui and zetai, respectively, are
defined as the virtual bond angle cr(i-1)-cr(i)-cr(i+1)
and the virtual dihedral angle o(i-1)dc(i-1)-c(i)do(i).
on this basis, the computed nmr structures reveal 31-helix
for segments glu21-ala24 and leu74-arg79, with short
stretches tyr50-cys51, arg59-pro61, and phe64-thr65 that
also satisfy the criteria listed above.
4 noesy connectivities which confirm the first beta-sheet were
identified between proton pairs lys15 hr and cys22 hn, lys15 hr and
glu21 hr, thr16 hn and glu21 hr, and thr16 hn and leu20 hn. the
second beta-sheet involves a total of four residues; however, the structure
yields only two noe connectivities: between ala24 hr and asn49 hr
and between trp25 hn and asn49 hr. the third beta-sheet displays the
following noe connectivities: between trp62 hr and cys75 hn,
between trp62 hr and leu74 hr, between cys63 hn and leu74 hr,
between cys63 hn and glu73 hn, between phe64 hr and glu73 hn,
betweeen thr65 hn and trp72 hr, and between thr65 hn and arg71 hn.

hydrogen bond network. the largest beta-sheet (figure 5b),
which spans residues trp62-phe64 and trp72-leu74, is
stabilized by the following backbone-backbone h-bond
bridges: cys63-nh‚‚‚oc-glu73, thr65-nh‚‚‚oc-arg71, glu73nh‚‚‚oc-cys63, and cys75-nh‚‚‚oc-pro61. the sheet exhibits a right-handed twist similar to what is observed for
the tpa k2 (14) or the upa kringle (71). the two remaining
beta-structures are each comprised of only four residues, and
characterized by similar spatial orientations, being aligned
in the same plane. backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds
ser14-co‚‚‚hn-cys22 and thr16-nh‚‚‚oc-leu20 pair segments lys15-thr16 and leu20-glu21 in an antiparallel
beta-sheet. the sheet involving residues ala24-trp25 and
lys48-asn49 is rather sketchy, as only one h-bond, between
the peptidyl nh of trp25 and the lys48 carbonyl, can be
identified. all h-bonded amide nhs in beta-sheets exhibit
retarded 1h-2h exchange (figure 7).
beta-sheets of residues 62-64 paired to 72-74 and 15-16
paired to 20-21 are positioned quasi orthogonal relative to
each other and connect via a thr16-hgamma1‚‚‚o-glu73 h-bond,
as found in pgn k4 and tpa k2 (77, 78). additional
backbone-backbone h-bonds exist between the met17 nh
and the leu74 co, identified in the pgn k1, k4, and k5 and
tpa k2 and, common to all pgn kringles, between gln23
and phe64, neighboring the cys22-cys63 bridge (17, 72, 77,
78). unobserved in homologous kringles is the k2 h-bond
between the ser18 ohgamma and the glu73 o. in contrast, while
in pgn k1 lys15 interacts with asp76 (16), only one of the
20 k2 structures displays h-bonding between the two side
chains.
the 310-helix turn involves h-bonds between co(i) and
nh(i+3), specifically between ile37-co‚‚‚hn-lys40 and pro38co‚‚‚hn-phe41, the former also identified in the pgn k1
and k5 (17, 72). pro38 satisfies the 310-helix criterion of
displaying a phi of about -49° and a psi of about -26°,
whereas the following two residues exhibit increasing
deviations from the idealized values. in the pgn k1amcha complex (17), tpa k2 (78), and the upa kringle
(71), short helices of about one to two turns have been
identified which, when compared against k2, are shifted
downstream by two to four residues. four beta-turns are
indicated,5 encompassing segments gly6-tyr9 (1), thr16gly19 (2), asn53-arg56 (3), and asp67-lys70 (4), characterized by a co(i)‚‚‚hn(i+3) hydrogen bond. these h-bonds and
beta-turns are also observed in the pgn k1, k4, and k5, except
for the h-bond between residues 53 and 56, which is missing
in k4 (17, 72, 77).

the figures were generated with the program molmol-2.6 (63).

the trp25 nh1, which exhibits the slowest 1h-2h
exchange kinetics among trp indole groups in k2, is
h-bonded to the tyr50 co, while its backbone nh h-bonds
the lys48 co. the two h-bonds are also found in pgn k1,
k4, and k5 and the tpa k2. furthermore, the trp62 nh1 is
h-bonded to the asp55 codelta, whereas the corresponding group
of trp72 is not involved in h-bond formation, consistent with
its fast 1h-2h exchange.
hydrophobic core and binding site. the k2 ligand
binding site was identified on the basis of 28 unambiguous
kringle-ligand noes (figure 8a and table 2). the ligand
is in close vdw contact with the aromatic rings of trp62 and
trp72, oriented at ∼75° relative to each other (figure 8b,c).
in the k2 1h nmr spectrum, the trp72 indole hzeta3 resonance
appears at 6.43 ppm, while in the pgn k4 and tpa k2
spectra, the equivalent signals exhibit distinct high-field shifts
(5.03 and 5.51 ppm, respectively) (14, 79). in both the pgn

k4 and tpa k2, position 74 is occupied by a tyr residue
whose ring hdelta and h protons are separated from the trp72
hzeta3 by ∼3.7-4.7 å, the tyr74 aromatic ring inducing highfield shifts on the trp72 hzeta3 resonance. in contrast, k2 carries
a leu residue at position 74, also close to the trp72 hzeta3.
thus, the k2 trp72 indole spectrum is typical of an exposed,
“random coil” trp side chain.
tyr36 exhibits noe connectivities to trp25, trp62, and
phe64. the latter, in turn, interacts with the trp25, tyr36, trp62,
and trp72 side chains, with trp25 exhibiting noe connectivity to trp62. thus, trp25, buried within the k2 structure,
expectedly does not exhibit overhauser connectivities to the
ligand. likewise, leu46, whose delta-methyl resonances exhibit
a high-field shift (-0.85 and 0.48 ppm), a fingerprint of a
proper kringle fold, is not in contact with the ligand. noe
connectivities between the leu46 hdelta1 and hdelta2 and the trp25
indole ring and phe41 side chain localizes the strictly

molecular dynamics. 15n magnetic relaxation and 1h15n noe data for the k2 backbone amides are summarized
in figure 10. within the k2 structure proper (residues cys1cys80), the average t1 and t2 are 0.40 and 0.16 s, respectively.6 in the 1h-15n xnoe experiment, residues exhibiting
the most pronounced response to proton rf saturation are
glu-2, glu-1, cys1, lys47, arg56, ile77, arg79, and thr81. in
the case of side chain nh groups, the (folded) cross-peaks
from arg residues 56 and 79 change the sign in the proton
saturation experiment, consistent with high mobility, whereas
arg52, arg59, and arg71 exhibit weaker responses (intensity
ratios of 0.63, 0.14, and 0.60, respectively), suggesting a
degree of immobilization.
magnetic relaxation experiments with the k2-amcha
complex were analyzed according to the extended modelfree approach (66, 67). from the data, a tauc of ∼4.49 ns was
estimated. in general, most residues within the k2 sequence
exhibit backbone order parameters s2 in the range of 0.80.9, indicative of a structurally well defined domain. chemical exchange terms rex were fitted for residues c22, h31,
6

within the kringle proper, the residues with t1 values exceeding
the average are ser5 (0.43 s), lys12 (0.42 s), glu21 (0.44 s), ser27 (0.44
s), his31 (0.42 s), phe41 (0.43 s), lys47 (0.48 s), asn53 (0.42 s), asn69
(0.42 s), lys70 (0.44 s), and ile77 (0.50 s). residues with t2 values
distinctly larger than those of their neighbors are ser5 (0.18 s), glu21
(0.19 s), lys47 (0.20 s), lys70 (0.19 s), and ile77 (0.23 s), while
significantly short t2 values characterize residues his31 (0.08 s), his33
(0.1 s), and ile37, thr65, and thr66 (0.12 s). expectedly, larger t1 (t2)
values result for residues within the glu-2-glu-1-cys1 n-terminal tail
as well as for the c-terminus, thr81: glu-2, 0.58(0.38) s; glu-1,
0.50(0.28) s; cys1, 0.46(0.22) s; and thr81, 0.47(0.24) s.

h33, i37, t65, t66, and w72. excluding n- and c-terminal
tails (0.45 < s2 < 0.61), the overall generalized order
parameter for k2 is 0.85 ( 0.04. for residues within the
asn69-lys70 and asp76-cys80 segments, relatively lower
values of s2 are determined (〈s2〉 ∼ 0.79 and 0.76, respectively; lys70 0.76, ile77 0.66, and arg79 0.76). additional k2
residues characterized by relatively low order parameters are
cys1 (0.71), ser5 (0.79), lys12 (0.80), glu21 (0.76), ser27
(0.78), phe41 (0.77), and lys47 (0.69). within the loops (seven
total), 〈s2〉 ranges between 0.78 and 0.87. the least mobile
peptide segments (picosecond time scale) are those encompassing the two inner disulfide bonds (〈s2〉 ∼ 0.86-0.87 (
0.03): loops 51-63 and 63-75.
similarly, segments participating in antiparallel beta-sheets
are characterized by low mobility. thus, paired stretches 1516 to 20-21, 24-25 to 48-49, and 62-64 to 72-74 exhibit
high 〈s2〉 values, namely, ∼0.84, ∼0.87, and ∼0.89, respectively. the latter beta-sheet includes trp62, the residue exhibiting
the highest backbone s2 in k2 (∼0.95 ( 0.014). two
backbone amide h-bonds are observed between arg52 and
trp62 which might restrict its mobility. these results are in
line with the assessment that trp62 can contribute significantly to the stability of the native kringle conformation (83).
the alternating high and low values of s2 for the cys63asp67 segment reflect localized h-bonding. the more ordered
cys63, thr65, and asp67 nh groups bind glu73 and arg71
backbone co groups and thr65 ogamma1, respectively, whereas
the phe64 and thr66 nhs exhibit no h-bonding. amide nh
groups of key residues at the binding site ionic centers (asp55,
glu57, and arg71) generally are endowed with low mobility
(s2 ∼ 0.88, 0.86, and 0.91, respectively). residues with
relatively unordered backbone peptidyl bonds such as ser5,
glu21, lys47, and ile77 are characterized by non-h-bonded
amide nh groups.
in case of side chains, s2 values of ∼0.79 are obtained
for trp25 and trp62 nh1 groups, somewhat higher than that
for trp72 (0.72). these s2 values are consistent with the trp25
and trp62 nh1 groups being internally h-bonded and
exhibiting retarded 1h-2h exchange in 2h2o. the s2 values
of the arg52, arg59, and arg71 nh groups, which show a
positive peak intensity ratio in the xnoe experiment, were
determined to be 0.75, 0.46, and 0.64, respectively. it is likely
that the values reflect the extent of h-bonding; in the 20
calculated final structures, arg52 nh interacts with asn45
co (in 14 out of 20 structures), the arg59 nh is h-bonded
to cys75 co (5 out of 20), and the nh of arg71 is h-bonded
to the ligand’s carboxylate group (11 out of 20). the latter
result would be consistent with the mobility of the arg71
side chain decreasing upon ligand complexation.
discussion
the structures of ligand-complexed tpa k2, pgn k1, k4,
and k5 have been characterized by nmr and x-ray
crystallographic methods (14-17, 87). from these studies,
the binding site has been identified as being configured by
residues 35, 36, 55-57, 62-64, and 71-74 (19, 71, 72, 77,
78, 88). backbone alignment of pgn k1, k2, k4, and k5
(figure 6) shows that the four lysine-binding kringles in pgn
exhibit similar overall foldings. on the other hand, the
reported (30) noe connectivities between 6-aha and k2
indicate close van der waals contacts of the ligand with the

6 hz), half-filled (6 hz e 3jhnr e 8 hz), and filled (3jhnr > 8 hz) circles. peptidyl amide protons, yielding cross-peaks in the 1h-15n
hsqc experiment 8 and 186 h after dissolving r-k2 in 2h2o, are classified as being of medium (m) and slow (s) exchange rates, respectively.

aromatic side chain rings of residues tyr36, trp62, phe64, and
trp72, in agreement with those previously measured between
various ligands and the homologous kringles. therefore,
other specific differences in the constellation of residues at
the lbs are expected to modulate their relative affinities
toward small zwitterionic ligands (30). by reference to the
homologues, the putative pgn k2 binding site exhibits (a) a
glu instead of an asp residue at position 57, (b) a basic
residue, arg56, between asp55 and glu57, and (c) a lack of a
basic residue at position 35. furthermore, k2 is devoid of
tyr74 (replaced by leu74) which in the homologous pgn
kringles stabilizes the orientation of the aromatic ring of
residue 72 at the lbs.
the antifibrinolytic agent amcha, among the most potent
kringle ligands, is characterized by the following equilibrium
association constants: ka > 300 mm-1 for pgn k1 (84),
∼159 mm-1 for pgn k4 (85), ∼44.2 mm-1 for pgn k5 (25,
30), and ∼69.4 mm-1 for tpa k2 (86). by comparison, the
affinity of the pgn k2 for amcha (ka ∼ 7.3 mm-1) is
relatively low (30). the 1h-15n hsqc experiments (figure
3) reveal that it is the asp55-leu58 peptide backbone segment

that exhibits the highest response to amcha binding (figure
9). within this segment, the leu58 amide resonances display
the most pronounced ligand-induced shift, echoing perturbation of the glu57 deltacoo-, to which it is h-bonded. these
effects are consistent with the canonical kringle lbs model,
which attributes key roles to the acidic residues at positions
55 and 57 in the interaction with ligand (81). backbone
amides of lbs residues such as trp62, phe64, arg71, and trp72
are less affected by the ligand, in line with structural
stabilization within a beta-sheet. revealing close proximity of
k2 aromatic rings to the ligand, indole group nhs of trp62
and trp72 are substantially perturbed by amcha.
the modeled electrostatic surface potential of the ligand
binding site is shown in figure 8d. a noesy cross-peak
linking the amcha h32 to the glu57 hbeta (figure 8a)
constrains the ligand’s amino group to becoming positioned
within ionic interaction distance with the carboxylate group
of asp55 and glu57 (figure 8b). in the 20 k2 structures, the
cationic amcha amino group results placed either close
to the glu57 delta-carboxylate group (12 out of 20), close to the
asp55 gamma-carboxylate group (4 out of 20), or between the two

anionic groups (4 out of 20). thus, on average, the applied
force field would place the amcha n atom relatively closer
to the coo- group of glu57 (∼3.9 å) than to that of asp55
(∼4.4 å) which, in turn, is h-bonded to trp62 h1. on the
basis of chemical modification experiments, ligand preference
for the anionic side chain at position 57 had been indicated

for k4 by patthy and co-workers (82). in addition, the glu
occupancy of position 57 results in the side chain carboxylate
group showing a relatively lower degree of alignment along
the longitudinal axis of the binding site than is the case for
the asp57 side chain in the homologous pgn kringles, which
would lead to an entropically less favorable interaction with

the ligand’s cationic group. also, the crystallographic
structures of ligand-complexed k1 and k4 show the asp55
and asp57 cgamma atoms to be separated by ∼5.2 å, while in the
k2 nmr structure, the corresponding asp55-glu57 cgamma-cdelta
distance is ∼5.7 å.
in the homologous pgn kringles, an electrostatically neutral
residue occupies position 56, i.e., sandwiched between asp55
and asp57. in k2, the arg56 guanidinium group is poised to
ion-pair the glu7 deltacoo-. coincidentally, as revealed by the
hsqc experiment (figure 3), the glu7 nh is sensitive to
the presence of amcha. hence, the arg56 cationic locus,
although electrostatically might weaken the interaction with
ligand, is unlikely to directly interfere with the binding. as
shown elsewhere (30), a double arg56gly/glu57asp mutation only marginally increases the affinity of k2 for ligand.
the hsqc experiment (figure 3) is consistent with the
trp62 and trp72 indole rings interacting with amcha.
concurrently, the spectra provide novel unambiguous evidence for the arg71 guanidinium group mediating ligand
binding, as previously claimed for the pgn k1 and k4 (15,
16, 82). the drastic shift of the k2 arg71 nh 1h and 15n
resonances to low fields (notice that the arg71 nh crosspeak is folded along delta1) concurs with the generation of a
significant h-bond, purportedly via electrostatic interaction
of the arg71 cationic group with the carboxylate group
(distances to neta and n of ∼3.0 and ∼4.1 å, respectively;
figure 8b) of the ligand which, in turn, is also h-bonded to
tyr36 oheta. finally, the positive electrostatic potential at the
southern end of the lysine binding site is further strengthened
by an alignment of the his31 and his33 imidazole groups,

the latter stacked against the phe64 (tyr64 in k1) aromatic
ring.
the negative and positive ionic centers of the binding site
position themselves ∼1 å closer in k2 than in the homologous k1 or k4. conceivably, this may be related to the arg71
side chain in k2 not being restricted by an h-bond to the
backbone co of the position 32 residue or by electrostatic
repulsion from a basic side chain at position 35, as is the
case for arg71 in k1 and k4. thus, while in the k1amcha complex the arg71 neta2 is separated from asp55 and
asp57 odelta atoms by ∼10.0 and ∼12.1 å, respectively, and
in the k4-6aha complex by ∼9.4 and ∼12.5 å, respectively, somewhat shorter distances, ∼8.3 and ∼10.8 å,
respectively, result between the corresponding atoms in the
k2-amcha complex. this would be consistent with the
anomalous preference of k2 for 5-apa over 6-aha, a onemethylene unit (∼1.14 å) longer ligand (30).
paralleling what is observed for amcha, the ligand nracetyl-l-lysine exhibits ∼40-fold weaker interaction for the
pgn k2 (ka ∼ 0.96 mm-1) than for k1 and k4 (ka ∼ 41
and 37 mm-1, respectively). in contrast, nr-acetyl-l-lysine
methyl ester, which lacks a free carboxylate group, exhibits
similar binding affinities for k1, k2, and k4 (ka ∼ 0.16,
0.1, and 0.2 mm-1, respectively) (30). thus, when compared
against those of the pgn k1 and k4, the interaction of k2

with zwitterionic ligands is suggested also to be weakened
by a less supportive ion pairing configuration of the cationic
center at the binding site (figure 8b-d). indeed, besides the
different orientation of the arg71 guanidino group in both
k1 and k4, in these kringles the positive electrostatic
potential is boosted by the contribution of the arg35 (k1) or
lys35 (k4) side chains.
an unforeseen result stemming from this study is the
uncovering of significant 31-helix in the structure of human
pgn k2. the extended left-handed 31-helix motif, with three
residues per turn, is not characterized by a pattern of internal
h-bonds as the peptidyl n-h and cdo bonds project

biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 48, 1999 15753
outward. hence, recognition of 31-helix by visual inspection
of the structure is cumbersome, which explains the infrequent
identification of such helices in reported protein structures
(74, 89). furthermore, direct assessment of 31-helix structure
from homonuclear 1h noe connectivity criteria may in
general prove to be difficult to accomplish; as measured from
a computer-generated model of (poly)ala in a 31-helix
conformation, the closest interproton distances are as
follows: dhn(i)-hn(i+1) ) 4.69 å, dhn(i)-hr(i+1) ) 5.56 å,
dhr(i)- hn(i+1) ) 2.15 å, dhr(i)-hr(i+1) ) 4.32 å, dhr(i)-hbeta(i+1)
) 4.05 å, and dhbeta(i)-hbeta(i+1) ) 4.82 å. it follows that the only
interproton distances shorter than 6 å are sequential and,
therefore, not particularly informative. in contrast, the faruv cd spectrum, being most sensitive to secondary
structure, readily detects 31-helix regularity (75).
cd spectroscopy has been found useful for a qualitative
assessment of kringle beta-structure content (90, 91). a
significant presence of 31-helix in the structure of human
pgn k2 was indicated from analysis of the far-uv cd
spectra of k2 (figure 4) using cdsstr, a recently released
computer program (32). the cd results motivated us to reexamine the atomic coordinates of the 20 selected k2 nmr
structures via an objective search (89). this led us to
identifying segments glu21-ala24 and leu74-arg79, as well
as dipeptide stretches tyr50-cys51, arg59-pro61, and phe64thr65, as consistently satisfying the criteria for 31-helix
(figure 11).
since 31-helix had been ignored in the secondary structure
analysis of previous nmr and x-ray crystallographic models
of kringles, prompted by the cd analysis of k2, we have
inspected reported structures of pgn (16, 17, 72, 77, 92),
apolipoprotein(a) (93),  xxxg1044xxx  (94), and
prothrombin kringles (95, 96), which are available from the
brookhaven protein data bank, as these modules belong to
the same family (78, 81). using xtlsstr (89), we find that
the homologous three-dimensional structures also exhibit
closely alignable segments which share with the pgn k2 31helix characteristics. from inspection of figure 12, it is
apparent that 31-helical segments tend to cluster around cys

residues 22, 51, 63, 75, and 80, with stretches of residues
20-24 and 74-80 statistically contributing most of the 31helix content. from this analysis, we are led to conclude
that 31-helix indeed is an important component of kringle
secondary structure, to the extent that in the human prothrombin k2 22.8% of the sequence configures 31-helices,
surpassing its 17.7% beta-sheet content.
despite the structural constraints imposed by the cys51cys75 and cys1-cys80 bridges, the segment of residues 7580 is the least ordered within the k2 structure (〈s2〉 ∼ 0.78
( 0.05). coincidentally, this stretch contains most of the
leu74-arg79 31-helix, in agreement with the assessment that
31-helices are intrinsically flexible and prone to dynamically
interconvert to other types of secondary structure (74). thus,
one may ponder whether some sort of “accordion” stretch
or compression dynamics at this disulfide-bridged segment
may not reflect a functional adaptability of kringle modules
to interact with macrosubstrate ligands, such as fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ),
receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins.
conclusions
the pgn k2+3 construct is evolutionary conserved all the
way from lamprey to man (97). this points to the k2+3
supermodule as fulfilling a crucial role in determining the
biological function of pgn. the research reported here
focuses on characterizing the structure and overall molecular
dynamics of the k2 component of k2+3. the combined faruv cd and nmr spectroscopic approach has proven to be
most informative for a quantitative assessment of secondary
and tertiary structural components. as we demonstrate, it is
thanks to the cd evidence that significant 31-helix presence
in the k2 domain was uncovered. this ought to be relevant
both for the analysis of future kringle structures and, in
general, for the visualization of novel protein foldings. the
nmr solution structure of k2 suggests that the lower affinity
of k2 for zwitterionic ligands is due to the shorter longitudinal axial dimension of the k2 lbs rather than to the
presence of a basic residue at position 56 or of a glu instead
of an asp residue at position 57. combined with previously
reported mutagenesis studies, our study reveals that functional differences among homologous domains can result
from subtle structural factors that transmit through the global
conformation since conservative amino acid residue replacements can effectively modulate the relative affinities for
specific ligands in ways that cannot be directly predicted on
the basis of standard assumptions for the local buildup of
the binding site.
