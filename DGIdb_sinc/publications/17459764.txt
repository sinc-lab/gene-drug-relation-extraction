abstract
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufa) n-3 inhibit inflammation, in vivo and in vitro in keratinocytes. we examined in hacat keratinocyte cell
line whether  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) a n-3 pufa, gamma-linoleic acid (gla) a n-6 pufa, and arachidic acid a saturated fatty acid,
modulate expression of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2), an enzyme pivotal to skin inflammation and reparation. we demonstrate that only treatment
of hacat with gla and epa or a  xxxg1807xxx  ligand (roziglitazone), induced cox-2 expression (protein and mrna). moreover stimulation of
cox-2 promoter activity was increased by those pufas or rosiglitazone. the inhibitory effects of  xxxd1216xxx  and t0070907 ( xxxg1807xxx  antagonists),
on cox-2 expression and on stimulation of cox-2 promoter activity by epa and gla suggest that  xxxg1807xxx  is implicated in cox-2 induction.
finally, pla2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl  xxxd3217xxx  blocked the pufa effects on cox-2 induction, promoter activity and arachidonic
acid mobilization suggesting involvement of aa metabolites in ppar activation. these findings demonstrate that n-3 and n-6 pufa increased
 xxxg1807xxx  activity is necessary for the cox-2 induction in hacat human keratinocyte cells. given the anti-inflammatory properties of epa, we
suggest that induction of cox-2 in keratinocytes may be important in the anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism of action of pufas n-3
or n-6.

1. introduction
keratinocytes which are the predominant cell population in
the epidermis can respond to various types of injuries and
produce inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and
prostaglandins, chemotactic factors, adhesion molecules and
growth factors [1]. it is the case in contact hypersensitivity,
topic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis [2]. in other

injuries, keratinocytes can become hyperproliferative e.g. in
wound healing [3], or they can become both inflammatory and
hyperproliferative in diseases such as psoriasis [4].
keratinocytes are a source of prostaglandins [5] which
influence human keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation
[6,7].
cyclooxygenases (cox-1 and cox-2) catalyze a rate-limiting step in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes
from  xxxd208xxx  [8]. cox-1 is constitutively expressed in
a wide variety of cells including keratinocytes. this isozyme is
responsible for the physiological concentrations of prostaglandins needed to maintain cellular homeostasis and platelet
aggregation. in contrast, cox-2 is a highly inducible gene that
is normally absent from cells but can be expressed in many
tissues or cells including keratinocytes in response to injury,

inflammation, and/or cellular activation [9–11]. cox-2 is
considered as a pro-inflammatory enzyme and a chief target for
the treatment of inflammatory diseases. in contrast, several
studies present evidence that this enzyme possesses the ability
under certain conditions to resolve inflammation (review in
[12]). this anti-inflammatory property of cox-2 is associated
with the presence of  xxxg1073xxx  and its metabolites the cyclopentenone prostaglandins pgj2 and 15-deoxy-delta12–14-pgj2
(15d-pgj2) [13–15].
recently, novel mediators generated from n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas)  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and
docosahexaenoic acid that displayed potent bioactions were first
identified in inflammatory exudates during the resolving phase
of acute inflammation [16] and in tissues enriched with
docosahexaenoic acid [17]. the trivial names resolvin
(resolution phase interaction products) and docosatrienes were
introduced for the bioactive compounds belonging to these
novel series because they demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory
and immunoregulatory actions.
extensive research indicates that n-3 pufas are involved in
the reduction inflammation and participate to the prevention of
certain chronic diseases such as heart disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, ulcerative colitis and skin disorders whereas n-6 fatty
acids tend to promote inflammation [18]. several in vivo and
in vitro studies designed to examine the mechanism of action
of n-3 pufas to reduce inflammatory processes suggest that
n-3  xxxd2154xxx  could act by reducing the generation of prostaglandins derived from the  xxxd208xxx  ( xxxd208xxx , n-6) and
other inflammatory mediators by cells following inflammatory stimulus. the original view that n-3 pufas exert antiinflammatory effects by antagonising  xxxd208xxx  metabolism is probably not the only mechanism since some
prostaglandins such as cyclopentenone prostaglandins
derived from  xxxd208xxx  have anti-inflammatory properties [12–15]. furthermore, it is established that a deficit of
n-6 essential  xxxd2154xxx  (linoleic acid and/or gamma-linolenic
acid) may be linked to inflammation of the skin such as atopic
eczema [19].
it has been shown that pufas and certain of their oxidized
products are able to bind and activate all three peroxisomal
proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) isoforms alpha, beta/delta and gamma
[20]. the ppars are nuclear hormone receptors and ligandactivated transcription factors that regulate target gene expression by binding to specific peroxisome proliferator-response
elements (ppres) [21]. ppars have been demonstrated to be
key regulators of lipid metabolism and associated with genes
that affect insulin action. recent studies suggested that all three
ppars isoforms also play a pivotal role in the regulation of
cellular proliferation and participate in the regulation of
inflammatory response. furthermore, several evidences suggest
that the cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15d-pgj2, which functions as an endogenous ligand for  xxxg1807xxx  [22,23] would
attenuate the  xxxg1559xxx  mediated transcriptional activation of
many pro-inflammatory genes by  xxxg1807xxx -dependent and
 xxxg1807xxx -independent mechanisms [12,24].
there are several reports suggesting a reciprocal interaction
between cox-2 expression and  xxxg1807xxx  signaling. induction of

577

cox-2 by 15d-pgj2 was reported in immortalized epithelial
and colorectal cancer cells [25,26]. the induction of cox-2
expression by  xxxg1807xxx  agonists has also been shown in monocytes [27] and in human synovial fibroblasts [28]. more
recently, it has been shown that uvb irradiation of keratinocytes augmented cox-2 expression via  xxxg1807xxx  activation [29].
in contrast, other studies have found that  xxxg1807xxx  ligands
(ciglitazone, troglitazone, and 15d-pgj2) inhibited ap-1mediated transcriptional activation of cox-2 in human
epithelial cells [30] and in cervical cancer cells [31] and blocked
serum-induced cox-2 expression in prostate cancer cells [32].
furthermore 15d-pgj2 suppressed cox-2 expression in fetal
hepatocytes [33].
given that n-3 and n-6 pufas seem to modulate differently
skin inflammation and that cox-2 expression is involved
during activation and resolution of inflammatory processes, we
evaluated the effects of pufa n-3, epa, and pufa n-6, gla
on cox-2 gene and protein expression in keratinocytes. our
work shows that pufas n-3 and n-6 but not saturated fatty acid
increase cox-2 expression in human hacat keratinocytes cell
line and that these inductions were mediated by  xxxg1807xxx 
activation via a cpla2 pathway.

2.2. cell culture
hacat cells (passages 35–40) [36] were grown in dmem 10% fcs in
37 °c, 5% co2. for the experiment, cells were plated in 24 wells with dmem
1% fcs for western blot and rt-pcr. cells were seeded one night before
stimulation for western blot or rt-pcr. for transfection experiments, cells
were plated in 12 wells in dmem without serum during transfection. inhibitors
 xxxd1216xxx  (1 mum) and  xxxd2603xxx  (10 mum) (or vehicle in the control groups) were
added 1 h before stimulation with  xxxd2154xxx .

2.3. analysis of cox-2 and  xxxg1807xxx  expressions by western blot
after stimulation, cells were washed twice with pbs at room temperature
and lysed in laemmli buffer [37]. samples were loaded on a 10% sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membrane. after blocking with 5% of fat-free milk, membranes were probed
with cox-2 antibody (1/200) or  xxxg1807xxx  antibody (1/5000), washed and
incubated again with a species specific polyclonal antibody labeled with
horseradish peroxidase (hrp). to reveal cox-2 we used an anti-mouse igg (1/
1000) for 1 h at room temperature and to  xxxg1807xxx  an anti-rabbit igg (1/5000).
membranes were then incubated with the west pico chemoluminescent
substrate and exposed to film before development. for  xxxg53xxx  analysis, the
blot was stripped at room temperature for 30 min with a stripping buffer (2% v/v
sds; 62.5 mm tris–hcl; 100 mm  xxxd26xxx ), washed 5 times and
reprobed with a goat polyclonal antibody directed against  xxxg53xxx  (1/1000).
membranes were then washed and incubated with an anti-goat hrp conjugated
(1/10000). the immune complex was revealed using a chemiluminescence
system as described before. the resulting bands on the exposed films were
quantitated by image station using the software morphostar (imstar, paris,
france). histograms represent the ratio of cox-2/ xxxg53xxx  and the control is 100.
 xxxg53xxx  served as internal standard.

2.4. reverse transcription and real-time pcr of cox-2
we used a reverse transcription, comparative real-time pcr method where
we quantified the transcripts of an endogenous gene ( xxxg53xxx ) as an rna
internal standard. rna extraction was done by using trizol reagent and it was
then purified using the chloroform/isopropanol/ethanol procedure according to
invitrogen instructions. reverse transcription was performed by first-strand
cdna synthesis kit (promega, charbonnières les bains, france) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, rna samples were first incubated with oligodt and then we introduced a mix that contained amv reverse transcriptase and
dntp. after 90 mn of incubation at 42 °c, we stopped polymerization. a realtime hot-start pcr was performed for cox-2 and  xxxg53xxx  cdna with the lc
faststart dna master sybr green i kit (roche diagnostics, meylan, france)
in a light-cycler® system (roche diagnostics) following roche instructions.
for specific and efficient amplification, we had previously performed
experiment to optimise mgcl2 and primer concentration. our mixture contains
4 mm of mgcl2 and 0.5 mum of each primer for a total volume of 20 mul. the
cycling conditions used were as follows: 95 °c for 8 min to activate the fast
start taq dna followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 68 °c for 30 s for
cox-2 and  xxxg53xxx . the primers were designed with the primer express
software (applied biosystems). pcr for  xxxg53xxx  and cox-2 were done in the
same run. the primers were : 5′-cctcaccctgaagtacccca-3′ (sens) and
5′-tgccagattttctccatgtcg-3′ (antisens) for  xxxg53xxx . 5′-gaatcattcaccaggcaaattg-3′ (sens) and 5′-tttctgtactgcgggtggaac-3′
(antisens) for cox-2.
real-time pcr data are represented as ct values, where ct was defined as
the crossing threshold of pcr by light-cycler® system. for calculating relative
quantification of cox-2 mrna expression, we have used the following
procedure. deltactcox-2 = ctsample − ctvehicle. deltactbeta-actin = ctsample − ctvehicle. then,
deltadeltact represented the difference between deltact  xxxg53xxx  and deltact cox-2
calculated by the formula deltadeltact = deltactbeta-actin − deltactcox-2. finally, the n-fold
differential expression of cox-2 mrna samples compared to the vehicle was
expressed as 2deltadeltact.
to examine the linearity of the assay, a serial dilution of the control sample
was used. the linearity of the mrna concentrations versus ct values of the

pcr reaction in the serial diluted samples was calculated by linear regression
analysis (y = 3.44x − 26.92). the ct values change proportionally according to
the serial dilution of the sample. the correlation coefficient of the mrna
concentration and ct value (r2 = 0.98) indicates that the quantity of mrna is
adequately represented by the ct value and validates the calculation of the
2deltadeltact.

2.5. transient transfection and reporter gene assays
the day prior to transfection, hacat cells were seeded in 12-well plates.
cells (10–20% of confluence) were transiently transfected in a serum-free
medium for 18 h using fugene 6. the ratio of dna:fugene was 1:3 with a dna
amount of 2 mug. cells were transfected with different plasmid reporter constructs
containing the 1.4 kb cox-2 promoter fragment or the minimal cox-2
promoter or the ppar responsive element (ppre) and the beta-galactosidase
expression vector to normalise transfection experiment.
cells were lysed 24 h later to measure reporter activities, according
promega’s instructions. luciferase values were normalised to beta-galactosidase
activity and fold activation was calculated. luciferase and beta-galactosidase
activity were measured with the wallac 1420 victor2™.

2.6.  xxxd208xxx  mobilization study
to evaluate  xxxd208xxx  mobilization from phosphatidylcholine (pc)
after fatty acid treatment, hacat cells were labeled by addition of [3h]
 xxxd208xxx  (amersham; 1 muci/ml), in culture medium with 1% (v/v) fcs
for 18 h at 37 °c under an atmosphere of 5% co2. at the end of the
incorporation course, [3h]  xxxd208xxx  was removed by washing monolayer
cells three times with pbs, and cells were pretreated or not with  xxxd2603xxx  (10 mum)
a pla2 inhibitor for 1 h before addition of appropriate  xxxd2154xxx  (20 ng/ml).
the study of the [3h]  xxxd208xxx  mobilization process was performed
after 1 h of culture with or without  xxxd2154xxx  by analysing [3h] aa into cellular
lipids. the cellular lipids were extracted twice with hexan/isopropanol (3:2, v/v),
evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and the residues were dissolved in
chloroform and analysed by thin layer chromatography as described [38].
briefly, the lipid extract was applied to lk-6-df whatman 20 × 20 silica-gel
plates previously heated for 1 h at 100 °c. the plates were run up to 10 cm with
chloroform/methanol/water/triethylamine (30:34:8:35, v/v) to separate the
phospholipids and were dried. they were then run again in the same direction
for a further 6 cm with petroleum ether/ xxxd2052xxx /acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v) to
separate the cholesteryl esters and neutral lipids and free fatty acid. the
radioactive metabolites were identified using a berthold tlc scanner and were
quantified by beta scintillation counting using a 1217 rackbeta counter (lkb).

2.7. fluorescence imaging confocal microscopy
hacat cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates
at 5 × 104 cells/well. cells were cultured 24 h and stimulated for 1 h with pufas,
arachidic acid and rosiglitazone for  xxxg1807xxx  localization.
cells were washed twice with pbs and fixed in ice-cold pbs containing 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min. cells were washed twice with pbs, permeabilized
in ice-cold pbs containing 0.5% triton x-100 for 15 min, and blocked in pbs
containing 10% fbs and 0.1% triton x-100 for an additional 30 min at 37 °c
and rinsed in pbs. the fixed cells were incubated with anti  xxxg1807xxx  (1:50)
antibody for 16 hr at 4 °c. the cells were washed three times with pbs
containing 0.5% triton x-100 and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-mouse igg antibody (jackson immuno research) at 1:50 in pbs
containing 1% fbs and 0.5% triton x-100 for 1 h at 37 °c. nuclei were stained
with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide  xxxd1891xxx  mug/ml. after three washes with pbs, the treated
cells were covered with glass slips using perma fluor. the slides were examined
using a zeiss lsm510 laser scanning confocal microscopy to determine the
cellular localization of  xxxg1807xxx .

2.8. statistical analysis
for western blot analysis, sds-page gels were from a representative
experiment composed of three separate experiments. a statistical analysis of

g. chêne et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1771 (2007) 576–589
gels from these three independent experiments was performed. numerized data
of the expression of cox-2 in keratinocytes were expressed as percentage
relative to numerized data of the cox-2 / xxxg53xxx  bands of treated keratinocytes
relative to the numerical value of the cox-2 / xxxg53xxx  bands of untreated
keratinocytes. these data were presented as mean ± standard error (sem) of
three independent experiments. the effect of treatments was considered
significant when the confidence interval of the data did not include the
reference value 100.
concerning the studies of rt real-time pcr and of transfection of the cox-2
reporter gene, results were expressed respectively as 2deltadeltact and as percent over
control of luciferase/beta-gal activities and were mean ± sem of three independent
experiments. statistical analysis was performed using an analysis of variance
followed by bonferroni/dunnett’s test. for all these statistical analysis, p < 0.05
was considered as the level of statistical significance.

3. results
3.1. pufas, gamma-linoleic acid (gla) and eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa) induced cox-2 expression in hacat cells
in order to determine the effects of gamma-linoleic acid
(gla, n-6 pufa),  xxxd2318xxx  (epa-n-3 pufa) and
arachidic acid a c20 saturated fatty acid, on the cox-2
expression, we tested three different doses of these  xxxd2154xxx 
(2, 10 and 20 mug/ml) during 24 h on the keratinocyte cell line,
hacat. the cox-2 protein level was evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-cox-2 antibody. fig. 1a shows that only

fig. 1. cox-2 protein and mrna are increased by the pufas, epa and gla. hacat cells were split in 24 wells plate at 3 × 105 cells /well. (a) after a night for
adhesion, cells were cultured during 24 h in presence or absence of different doses of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas),  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and gammalinoleic acid (gla) or saturated fatty acid (sfa) arachidic acid (ar.a), (at 2, 10 and 20 mug/ml) or pma + a23187 (pma/a23) (at 0.5/1 mum) and cells were lysed with
100 mul of laemmli buffer. 20 mul of each sample were used for the western blot. cox-2 and  xxxg53xxx  expressions were measured by western blot using anti-cox-2
antibody and anti- xxxg53xxx  antibody as described in materials and methods. the histogram represents numerical data of cox-2/ xxxg53xxx  issued from the quantification of
bands as described in materials and methods and were presented as mean ± standard error (sem) of the three independent experiments. the effect of treatments was
considered significant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01), when the confidence interval of the data did not include the reference value 100. the immunoblot is representative of
three separate experiments. (b) after a night for adhesion, cells were cultured during 4 h in presence or absence of different doses of  xxxd2154xxx  (2, 10 and 20 mug/ml) or
pma/a23 (0.5/1 mum). rna isolation, rt real-time pcr and mrna relative level were performed as described in materials and methods.  xxxg53xxx  served as internal
standard. histogram represents the mean of 2deltadeltact ± standard error (sem) of the three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 (**p < 0.01) indicates a significant
difference as compared with control group without treatment.

gla and epa are able to increase the level of cox-2 in a dosedependent manner. the inductions of cox-2 were 150% to
400% for the induction with epa and 250% to 500% for the
induction with gla. in the same experimental conditions
pma/a23187 induced cox-2 expression (350%). in contrast,
the saturated 20-carbon fatty acid arachidic acid, has no effect
on cox-2 expression pattern. we also evaluated the cox-2
mrna level by real time rt-pcr using the lightcycler and
sybr® green i fluorogenic dye. the mrna was extracted 4 h
after treatment of hacat cells with the  xxxd2154xxx . fig. 1b
shows that epa and gla increase the mrna level in a dosedependent manner while the arachidic acid has no significant
effect. gla at high concentration (20 mug/ml) produces a
comparable effect on cox-2 mrna level that pma/a23187.
3.2. pufas-induced cox-2 expression in hacat cells is
transcription dependent
to determine whether epa and gla regulate cox-2
expression at transcriptional level and to understand the
signalling pathway implicated, hacat cells were transiently
transfected with cox-2 promoter/luciferase construct (−1432/
+ 59) [34] then treated with ar.a, epa or gla (20 mug/ml) for
24 h. as shown in fig. 2a, epa and gla, strongly increased
cox-2 promoter activity. epa stimulated cox-2 promoter
activity by 7-fold and gla by 6-fold, while ar.a produced a

fig. 2. pufas, epa and gla stimulates promoter activity of cox-2 gene.
hacat cells were plated  xxxd1891xxx –20% of confluence in 12 well plates 1 day before
transfection. cells were transiently transfected with fugene 6. the ratio of dna:
fugene was 1:3 with a dna amount of 2 mug. cells were transfected with the
1.4 kb cox-2 promoter fragment (a) or 0.3 kb cox-2 fragment (b) and betagalactosidase expression vector. during transfection, cells were cultured with
dmem only. after 18 h, medium was removed and the hacat cells were
stimulated by unsaturated or saturated  xxxd2154xxx   xxxd2318xxx  (epa),
gamma-linoleic acid (gla) or arachidic acid (ar.a) at 20 mug/ml with dmem
supplemented with 1% fcs. cells were lysed 24 h later to measure reporter
activities, according to the manufacturer's instructions. the promoter activity
was expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity to beta-gal activity. the mean of
luciferase activity for the control was about 122 556 for the 1.4 kb fragment and
about 98 655 for the 0.3 kb fragment. histogram represents the mean of relative
reporter gene activities ± standard error (sem) for three independent experiments. **p < 0.01 indicates a significant difference as compared with control
group (tem) without treatment.

marginal unsignificant effect. these results show that cox-2 is
transcriptionally induced by epa and gla.
the promoter of cox-2 has been described to contain sp1,
 xxxg1559xxx , nf- xxxg1181xxx  and cre elements in the region (− 270/+ 59)
relative to the transcription start site (tss). transfection of
hacat cells with the cox-2 (− 327/+ 59) reporter construct
showed no significant induction of cox-2 promoter activity by
epa and gla (fig. 2b), suggesting that the response elements
responsible for pufa response on cox-2 promoter are located
in the region (− 1432/−327) relative to the tss.
3.3. pufas-induced cox-2 expression in hacat cells is
mediated via  xxxg1807xxx  activation
previous articles have concluded that  xxxg1807xxx  activated cox-2
expression in particular in keratinocytes [29]. to study the
involvement of this nuclear receptor in the induction of cox-2
gene expression in our model, we first analysed the expression of
 xxxg1807xxx  in hacat cells. hacat cells express both  xxxg1807xxx  mrna
(data not shown) and protein as shown by western blot analysis
(fig. 3c). in order to determine whether  xxxg1807xxx  is functional in
hacat cells, transient transfection experiments were performed
in which the cells were transfected with the ppre-luc construct
[35] and treated with epa, gla and ar.a (20 mug/ml) or
rosiglitazone (10 mum). epa led to a 4-fold induction in luciferase,
while gla and rosiglitazone led to a significant 2.5-fold
induction in luciferase activity and ar.a has no effect (fig. 3a).
confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis with pufatreated hacat cells for 1 h was also carried out to evaluate the
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  by treatment with epa or gla. the cells
were stained for  xxxg1807xxx  with a specific anti-human  xxxg1807xxx 
antibody that recognizes both ppargamma1 and  xxxg842xxx  isoforms and an
fitc-conjugated anti-goat igg antibody (green) and for dna
with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (red). the merged pictures show that
 xxxg1807xxx  was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm in
hacat cells (fig. 3b). when the cells were treated with either
epa or gla (20 mug/ml) or rosiglitazone (10 mum) a  xxxg1807xxx 
activator (fig. 3b),  xxxg1807xxx  translocated to the nucleus where the
colocalization of  xxxg1807xxx  and dna is evidenced by the yellow
color in the nuclei (fig. 3b). in contrast, with ar.a (20 mug/ml),
 xxxg1807xxx  staining was observed only in the cytoplasm.
to see whether  xxxg1807xxx  can activate endogenous cox-2
expression in hacat cells, western blots were done to study the
effect of rosiglitazone a  xxxg1807xxx  ligand on cox-2 protein
expression after 24 h. rosiglitazone, led to a induction of cox-2
protein in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 4a). the figs. 4b and c
show that rosiglitazone increases cox-2 mrna level in hacat
cells and promoter activity of cox-2 gene in hacat cells
transiently transfected with a cox-2 full-length promoter/
luciferase construct (− 1432/+ 59). in contrast, l165041 a
pparbeta/delta ligand did not modify cox-2 mrna expression
and promoter activity of cox-2 gene.

 xxxd1216xxx  inhibit the inductive effect of epa and gla on
cox-2 expression (fig. 6a).  xxxd1216xxx  had no significant effect
on cox-2 expression with ar.a (fig. 6a).
furthermore, as shown in fig. 6b, the specific  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonist  xxxd1216xxx  at 1 mum nearly completely blocked
(inhibitions ranged from 80 to 96%) the luciferase responses
of hacat cells transiently transfected with a cox-2 full-length
promoter/luciferase construct (− 1432/+ 59) induced by epa
and gla (at 20 mug/ml).  xxxd1216xxx  alone did not modify the

luciferase expression. therefore,  xxxd1216xxx  a specific  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonist, may act as a transcriptional inhibitor of cox-2
induction in hacat cells. these results, which are consistent
with the above conclusions, suggest that epa and gla were
able to regulate cox-2 transcription through  xxxg1807xxx  in these
cells.

revealed a role of this transcription factor on this promoter
region.
3.4. cpla2 inhibition blocks cox-2 expression
in a previous report we demonstrated that induction of
macrophage mannose receptor by a  xxxg1807xxx -dependent mechanism is inhibited by methyl arachidonyl  xxxd3217xxx 
( xxxd2603xxx , an inhibitor of cytosolic pla2 isoforms) [39]. to
explore the coupling between pla2 activation and cox-2
induction and to reveal a role of these pufa in the generation of
endogenous ligands for  xxxg1807xxx  via cytosolic pla2, we studied
the effect of  xxxd2603xxx  (10 mum) on cox-2 protein expression, as
well as on cox-2 gene promoter activation. we show that
 xxxd2603xxx  does not have any significant effect on cox-2
expression in un-treated hacat cells fig. 6a). using the
conditions described above we show that inhibition of cpla2
by  xxxd2603xxx  significantly reduced cox-2 protein expression in
the pufa-treated hacat cells (fig. 6a) and inhibited cox-2

gene promoter activation by epa and gla of hacat cells
transiently transfected with cox-2 promoter/luciferase construct (− 1432/+ 59) (fig. 6b). fig. 7 shows that  xxxd2603xxx  did not
modify cox-2 mrna overexpression in hacat cells (fig. 7a)
and cox-2 gene promoter activation of hacat cells transiently
transfected with a cox-2 full-length promoter/luciferase
construct (fig. 5b) induced by rosiglitazone, these results
suggest that cytosolic pla2 is required for cox-2 induction by
pufa and that this induction may depend on a specific
eicosanoid production.
to evaluate whether pufa triggers pla2 activation, we
investigated  xxxd208xxx  mobilization among phospholipids in [h3] xxxd208xxx  labeled hacat cells. after 18 h of
prelabeling, the majority of the radioactivity was recovered in
phosphatidylcholine (30%) followed, in decreasing order, by
phosphatidylinositol (24%), phosphatidylethanolamine (16%),
and phosphatidylserine (8%). the total radioactivity in the
phosphatidylcholine fraction was significantly decreased during
1 h incubation with pufa (fig. 8), demonstrating that pufas

584

g. chêne et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1771 (2007) 576–589

induced  xxxd208xxx  mobilization.  xxxd2603xxx , a specific
inhibitor of cytosolic pla2, strongly inhibited this pufainduced [h3] xxxd208xxx  mobilization from phosphatidylcholine (fig. 8). these results imply that a related
 xxxd2603xxx -sensitive pla2 is responsible for pufa-mediated
 xxxd208xxx  mobilization.
4. discussion

fig. 6. the induction of cox-2 expression by pufas was inhibited by  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonists and by pla2 inhibitor. (a) cells were split in 24 well plates at 3 × 105
cells /well. after a night for adhesion,  xxxd1216xxx  gw (1 mum), a  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonist or  xxxd2603xxx  (10 mum) a pla2 inhibitor were added to the culture

of each sample were used for the western blot. cox-2 and  xxxg53xxx  expressions
were measured by western blot using anti-cox-2 antibody and anti- xxxg53xxx 
antibody as described in materials and methods. the histogram represents
numerical data of cox-2/ xxxg53xxx  issued from the quantification of bands as
described in materials and methods and were presented as mean ± standard error
(sem) of the three independent experiments. the effect of treatments was
considered significant (**p < 0.01), when the confidence interval of the data did
not include the reference value 100. the immunoblot is representative of three
separate experiments. (b) hacat cells were plated  xxxd1891xxx –20% of confluence in
12 well plates 1 day before transfection. cells were transiently transfected with
fugene 6. the ratio of dna:fugene was 1:3 with a dna amount of 2 mug. cells
were transfected with a luciferase (luc) reporter plasmid for 1.4 kb cox-2
promoter fragment and beta-galactosidase expression vector. during the 18 h of
transfection, cells were cultured with dmem only. after 18 h, the culture
medium was changed by dmem supplemented with 1% fcs and  xxxd1216xxx 
gw (1 mum) or  xxxd2603xxx  (10 mum) were added to the culture medium 1 h before the
unsaturated or saturated  xxxd2154xxx  (20 mug/ml)  xxxd2318xxx  (epa),
gamma-linoleic acid (gla) or arachidic acid (ar.a). cells were lysed 24 h later
to measure reporter activities, according to the manufacturer's instructions. the
promoter activity was expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity to beta-gal
activity. histogram represents the mean of relative reporter gene activities

in this study, we show that epa (n-3 pufa) and gla (n-6
pufa) treatments induced cox-2 expression in the human
keratinocyte cell line, hacat. assays for transcriptional activity
based on the cox-2 promoter sequences driving luciferase
reporter gene provide evidence of regulation at the transcriptional level. using both  xxxg1807xxx  and pparbeta/delta ligands,
respectively rosiglitazone and l165041, and specific  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonists  xxxd1216xxx  and t0070907, we demonstrated that
 xxxg1807xxx  activation was necessary for this pufa-induced cox-2
overexpression.
the three ppar subtypes ( xxxg1805xxx , pparbeta/delta, and  xxxg1807xxx )
are expressed in mouse epidermis during fetal development and
shortly after birth. ppars expression becomes undetectable in
the interfollicular epidermis [40]. interestingly, mice model
experiments established that during wound healing,  xxxg1805xxx  and
pparbeta are required for rapid re-epithelialization where  xxxg1805xxx 
was shown to be important during the initial inflammatory
phase and pparbeta was shown to play a pivotal role for cell
migration and survival during re-epithelialization [40–42]. in
human skin all ppar subtypes are expressed also in the adult
interfollicular epidermis with pparbeta being by far the most
abundantly expressed ppar subtype [43–45]. furthermore,
treatment of normal human keratinocytes in vitro with a
pparbeta-selective ligand induces expression of keratinocyte
differentiation marker genes suggesting that pparbeta plays a role
in differentiation of human keratinocytes [45]. the present
studies and other demonstrated presence of  xxxg1807xxx  mrna and
functional protein in human keratinocyte [29,46,47]. recently,
it has been shown that, both in human and mice keratinocytes
 xxxg1807xxx  activation mediates also keratinocytes differentiation
[47].
other investigations have shown that pufas and prostanoids
that are, respectively, substrates and products of cox activities,
trigger gene expression via ppar activation [48,49]. cox-2
expression is also induced by  xxxg1807xxx  ligands [26,50,51] and it
has been suggested that this is mediated via a ppre in the cox2 promoter region [26]. in our study, we used the previously
described cox-2 promoter/reporter construct [34], which does
not have any ppre identified. we showed that the 5′-flanking
sequence − 1432/− 327 upstream from the transcription start site
of this cox-2 promoter construct was necessary for pufas to
induce its activity. using the embl clustalw software, we
characterized a new ppre site within the cox-2 promoter
region at position which matches the consensus site (9/12). this
putative ppre is located at position − 1070 to − 1058 from tss :
5′-tggtca c acctca-3′ in the sequence data bank available
under accession number d28235. further research are necessary
to identify whether this putative ppre in the cox-2 gene is

functional and plays a significant role in gene expression of
cox-2 in keratinocytes. the likelihood that the observed
induction of cox-2 in the hacat cells by pufas involves
transcriptional regulation by  xxxg1807xxx  was substantiated by
both the reporter promoter construct analysis and through the
use of  xxxg1807xxx  and pparbeta/delta agonists and of  xxxg1807xxx  antagonists,  xxxd1216xxx  and t0070907, [52,53].  xxxg1807xxx  involvement in the mechanism of action of pufas was also suggested
by the induction of luciferase activity in cells transfected with
ppre-luc.
we show by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis
that in unstimulated keratinocytes,  xxxg1807xxx  was localized
predominantly in the peri-nuclear region and the cytoplasm.
treatment of keratinocytes with pufa or rosiglitazone, a
 xxxg1807xxx  ligand [54] caused  xxxg1807xxx  to become nuclear-localized;
in contrast, with ar.a,  xxxg1807xxx  staining was observed only in the
cytoplasm. these data agree with the data in the literature that
show that in endothelial cells the three isoforms of the ppar
family are translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus upon
binding with ligand such as 15d-pgj2 [55]. also, recently, it
was shown in epithelial cells that 5- xxxd153xxx 
increased  xxxg1807xxx  expression, promoted its translocation from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and induced a modification of its
conformation permitting the recruitment of coactivators and the

activation of a peroxisome-proliferator response element-driven
gene [56]. so, this ability of pufa to induce nuclear
localization of  xxxg1807xxx  in keratinocytes could be an initial step
in  xxxg1807xxx  activation. however, other fluorescence imaging
studies in living cells show that ppars in the absence of ligand,
diffuse in the nucleus and, in that case, the mobility of the
ppars was reduced upon ligand binding, most probably by
enhancing interactions with cofactors and chromatin [57]. so, it
is possible that the cellular localization of  xxxg1807xxx  an its nuclear
translocation correspond to a cell-specific behavior.
the literature shows contradictory results on the effect of
 xxxg1807xxx  agonists on cox-2 expression with results suggesting
that  xxxg1807xxx  agonists suppress cox-2 expression after pma,
lps, or  xxxg2296xxx  stimulation in various cells such
as, breast cancer cells and macrophages [30,58,59], or that
 xxxg1807xxx  activation induce cox-2 expression in monocytes [27],
epithelial cells [29], synovial fibroblasts [28], and colon cancer
cells [26,59]. these divergent results may be due to differences
in mechanisms of  xxxg1807xxx  activation.  xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear
receptor/transcriptional factor belonging to the steroid receptor
family that requires ligand binding for activation. after binding
a ligand, it forms a heterodimer with 9-cis- xxxd3417xxx /retinoid
x receptor, migrates to the nucleus, binds to a ppar response
element and then recruit co-factors that are necessary to activate

or inhibit transcription of selected genes. the nature of the
ligand could induce the recruitment of different co-activators
and co-repressors complexes that would lead to opposite
transcriptional outcomes [60,61]. moreover, the studies that
showed  xxxg1807xxx -mediated cox-2 repression were performed in
stimulated cells while the studies that showed  xxxg1807xxx -mediated
cox-2 expression were performed in untreated cells. thus, the
basal status of cox-2 promoter, including the presence of
cofactors and the conformation of chromatin, could play a major
role in the activity of  xxxg1807xxx .
many studies have shown that increased cox-2 expression
is dependent on cpla2 activation [62] and that this enzyme
expression is inhibited by the group iv cpla2 inhibitor methyl
arachidonyl  xxxd3217xxx  ( xxxd2603xxx ), [63]. cpla2 is the
rate-limiting key enzyme in the liberation of the arachidonic
acid from membrane phospholipids.  xxxd208xxx  metabolites represent the natural ligands for  xxxg1807xxx  activation, it has
been demonstrated that activity of cpla2 played an important
role in the regulation of  xxxg1807xxx  mediated gene transcription in
human airway epithelial cells [64]. we previously reported
inhibitor effect of  xxxd2603xxx  on the regulation of  xxxg1807xxx  mediated
gene transcription of macrophage mannose receptor by a th2
cytokine il-13 [39]. here, we establish that  xxxg1807xxx  activation
is linked to cytosolic pla2 in the chain of events triggered by
pufas and lead to cox-2 expression. first, in cells transfected
with the cox-2 reporter gene, the cpla2 inhibitor  xxxd2603xxx 
inhibited reporter gene expression induced by pufas but not by
rosiglitazone. second, treatment of cells with pufas or
rosiglitazone increased cellular cox-2 protein levels and only
the effect of pufas was inhibited by coincubation with  xxxd2603xxx .

finally, treatments of hacat cells with pufas stimulate pla2
to promote  xxxd208xxx  mobilization from phosphatidylcholine. it is known that  xxxd208xxx  is subsequently
converted into eicosanoids among which the 15d-pgj2 is an
endogenous  xxxg1807xxx  ligand. these results are also consistent
with those previously reported by pawliczak et al. [65] which
demonstrate in human lung cells that cpla2 has an influence on
cox-2 gene and protein expression at least in part through
 xxxg1807xxx  activation.
an important result of our study is that exposure of hacat
cells to saturated fatty acid (arachidic acid, c20:0) has no effect
on pla2 activation,  xxxd208xxx  mobilization,  xxxg1807xxx 
activation and cox-2 induction. these results suggest that
these fatty acid effects on this  xxxg1807xxx  activation pathway were
dependent on the degree of unsaturation but independent of n-3
or n-6 family of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . similar results have
been described in neutrophils where epa and gpa promoted
the release of  xxxd208xxx  (in a time- and dose-dependent
manner), [66], while saturated acids such as octadecanoic
( xxxd3244xxx ;  xxxd3244xxx ) and eicosanoic (arachidic acid) acids had
no significant effect.
the biological significance of cox-2 induction in keratinocytes is unclear. cox-2 induction can be rapidly and transiently
stimulated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
il-1 and tnf-alpha, as well as by other factors, including endotoxin, hypoxia, ischemia,  xxxg681xxx , and  xxxg2269xxx .
following acute ultraviolet exposure, cox-2 expression was
predominantly induced in vivo in human skin [67] as well as in
vitro in keratinocytes cell lines in particular in hacat [68].
moreover, it has been recently shown in human epithelial cell
lines kb that the  xxxg1807xxx  system is implicated in the induction of
cox-2 expression by uvb radiation [29]. this induction of
cox-2 expression by uv radiation was coincident with an
increase in keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis [69]. the
data obtained after inhibition of cox-2 with selective cox-2
inhibitors suggest that cox-2 expression is probably necessary
for keratinocyte survival and proliferation occurring after acute
ultraviolet irradiation. analysis of cell cycle-associated proteins
revealed that prostaglandins produced by cox-2 are important
in the early steps of tissue repair and regeneration in particular in
cutaneous wound healing [70].
many studies have addressed the importance of cox-2
induction in skin inflammation or tumor promotion. the
consequences of increased cox-2 expression in inflammation
are complex. they can be protective or deleterious according to
the balance between the proinflammatory and the antiinflammatory effects of prostanoids produced by various cell
types under different circumstances. thus cox-2 could be a
bifunctional regulator of inflammatory processes. indeed, a
number of recent studies show that cox-2 also plays a
physiological role in several body functions. more recent data
show that cox-2 is induced during the resolution of an
inflammatory response, and leads to the production of antiinflammatory ( xxxg1073xxx  and pgf2alpha), but not proinflammatory
prostaglandins; inhibition of cox-2 at this point thus results in
persistence of the inflammation [14,71–73]. in fact, the pathophysiological role of cox-2 (pro- or anti-inflammatory) is much

g. chêne et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1771 (2007) 576–589

more complex than heretofore appreciated and this enzyme may
exert either beneficial or deleterious effects depending on the
intensity of its induction, the pathophysiological situation, and
the ability of specific cells to metabolize pgh2 produced by
cox-2 into pgs cytoprotective or which play an role in inflammation and tissue injury.
recent results published by storey et al. [74] show that in
hacat keratinocyte cell line, epa reduce basal secretion of
il-8 and ultraviolet b- and  xxxg2296xxx -induced il-8 release whereas
 xxxd2777xxx  (a mono-unsaturated fatty acid) has no influence on
il-8 release in the same cell line. so, epa which induce cox-2
expression in hacat cell line also inhibits the production of
uvb- and tnf-alpha-induced il-8 in these skin cells. based
on these results, we suggest that induction of cox-2 into
keratinocytes may be important in the photoprotective and other
anti-inflammatory effects conferred by preventive treatments by
the n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx .
in summary, the present study shows that gla (n-6 pufa)
like epa (n-3 pufa) induce cox-2 expression in hacat cell
line mediated by  xxxg1807xxx  activation via a pla2 pathway. given
the well-described beneficial effects of epa in various cell types,
we propose, despite the extensive literature documenting a
deleterious role of cox-2 activity in various pathophysiological
conditions, that the induction of this enzyme by pufa n-3 like n6 in keratinocytes, may exert beneficial protective and antiinflammatory effects. it has been shown recently that  xxxg1807xxx 
might be a useful intracellular target for the treatment of psoriasis
and inflammatory skin diseases [75,76]. thus, further studies are
needed to assess the relationship between cox-2 and  xxxg1807xxx 
activation in these epidermal disorders characterized by
inflammation, hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation.
