terfenadine (seldane®) is a potent and selective histamine hi
receptor antagonist in asthmatic airways13

introduction

.lung tissue is one of the richest sources
of histamine in humans (1); most of the
histamine is localized in the secretory
granules of mast cells (2). allergen challenge of isolated asthmatic lung and airway tissue stimulates the release of appreciable amounts of histamine by an
ige-dependent mechanism (3). thus,
histamine has been proposed as a
preformed mediator contributing to airflow obstruction in asthma. after bronchial provocation with inhaled allergen,
the early (4) and late bronchoconstrictor responses are associated with increased plasma concentrations of histamine (5). increased circulating histamine
concentrations have also been reported
in association with spontaneous attacks
of asthma (6). as an inflammatory mediator, histamine has wide-ranging effects
on the airways. constriction of smooth
muscle occurs both directly (7) and by
stimulation of vagal reflexes through an
interaction with ht receptors (8). histamine affects the pulmonary vasculature
by both h t and h2 receptors, h t mediating vasoconstriction, and h2 vasodilation
(9). other h 2 effects of histamine in the
airways are controversial, but include increased lung permeability (10-12) and
stimulation of leukocyte chemokinesis
(13). in animal studies, there is evidence
to suggest that  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists
enhance airway responsiveness to histamine (14) but in humans, the effects of
h2 antagonists in the airways has been
equivocal (15, 16).
with the discovery of drugs that antagonize histamine at its ht receptors, a
number of early clinical trials were carried out to assess the effects of orally administered hj receptor antagonists in
asthma, but only a small number
reported any clinical benefit (17). however, interest in ht receptor anatgonists
in asthma was renewed when it was shown
that intravenously administered chlorpheniramine produced bronchodilation
in patients with asthma (18). more re-

summary terfenadine (seldane®) is a new, highly potent h, histamine receptor antagonist that
in clinically effective doses is free of side effects. because the low potency and specificity of many
hi receptor antagonists have made it dif icult to define the precise role of histamine as a bronchoconstrictor mediator in asthma we have used terfenadine to define the degree and selectivity of h,
blockade that can be achieved in asthmatic airways. in a double-blind study, 9 asthmatic patients
received placebo or terfenadine 60,120, and 180 mg on separate daysfollowed3 h later by bronchial
provocation with increasing concentrations of either histamine or  xxxd2586xxx . terfenadine at 60,
120, and 180 mg produced significant bronchodilation with increases in fev, above baseline of
9.0, 9.5, and 10%, respectively (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.01). all 3 doses of terfenadine displaced
the histamine-fevi concentration response curves in a parallel fashion to the right in all subjects.
when the degree of protection against histamine is expressed as a concentration ratio, terfenadine
60,120, and 180 mg displaced the response curves by factors of 14.8 ± 4.6, 22.9 ± 6.7, and 34.3
± 8.4. in contrast to its effect on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, terfenadine failed to protect the airways against the constrictor effect of inhaled  xxxd2586xxx . thus, terfenadine is a much
more potent and selective hi receptor antagonist in asthmatic airways than previously available
antihistamines and should provide a powerful tool to define the contribution of histamine as a bronchoconstrictor mediator in asthma.

cently, hi antagonists inhaled as aerosols
have been shown to cause moderate bronchodilation (19, 20) and to offer some
protection against bronchoconstriction
induced by provocation with histamine
(21, 22), allergen (23), and exercise (24).
it is not known, however, whether bronchodilation is specific to the antagonism
of hi receptors or is the result of some
other pharmacologic property of these
drugs, such as antagonism of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors (23).
controversy over the effects of the
older hi antagonists on asthmatic airways are compounded by their lack of
efficacy, nonspecificity, and, at high
doses, unacceptable side effects. terfenadine (seldane®) is a highly potent and
selective hj histamine antagonist that has
been shown to be free from significant
side effects (25-27). terfenadine therefore permits a high degree of histamine
hi blockade to be achieved in humans.
to evaluate the efficacy and specificity
of terfenadine as an hi antagonist in the
airways of asthmatic subjects, we have
carried out a double-blind, placebocontrolled study in which the protective
effects of 3 doses of terfenadine, 60,120,
and 180 mg, were compared against bronchoconstriction provoked by histamine
and  xxxd2586xxx .

methods

nine patients (4 men and 5 women with a
mean age of 42 ± 4.2 yr) with mild asthma
were studied. seven patients were atopic,
demonstrating a greater than 3-mm wheal after skin prick tests to at least 2 common allergens. they had a mean fevt of 2.93 ± 0.3
l (78.5 ± 5.4% predicted), and a geometric
mean provocation concentration of  xxxd2586xxx  causing a 20% fall in fevt (pqofev,)
of 0.38 (range, 0.12 to 1.38 mg/ml). their
asthma was normally controlled by a combination of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoreceptor agonists and
inhaled corticosteroids. beta-adrenoreceptor
agonists were stopped 12 h before each study
day, but inhaled steroids were continued as
prescribed. none of the patients were
smokers. the study was approved by the
southampton hospitals and university ethical committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.
the study was carried out in 2 phases. during the first phase, patients attended on 4 sep(received in original form march 4, 1986 and in

arate occasions at the same time each day.
after a 15-min rest period, 2 baseline measurements of fev! were made 5 minutes apart
using a dry wedge spirometer (vitalograph,
buckingham, uk). on each occasion the
highest value of 3 recordings was used for
analysis. patients then received in random order one of the following treatments by mouth
in the form of identical tablets: placebo, terfenadine 60, 120, 180 mg. after medication,
measurements of fevi were recorded at
hourly intervals for 3 h followed by an inhalation challenge with histamine modified from
the method described by chai and coworkers (28). solutions were nebulized from a starting volume of 3 ml in an inspiron nebulizer
(cr bard international, pennywell industrial
estate, sunderland, uk), driven by compressed air at 8 l/min. under these conditions the nebulizer output was 1 ml/min, and
the mass median particle diameter was 4.7 n
(29). patients were instructed to inhale the
nebulized solution in 5 breaths from end-tidal
volume to maximal inspiratory capacity. subjects first inhaled 5 breaths of 0.9% sodium
chloride followed by measurements of fevj
after 3 min. if the fev! did not fall by more
than 10% of the starting baseline, histamine
challenge was undertaken. doubling concentrations of histamine acid phosphate (0.03 to
32 mg/ml, 0.1 to 104 mm/l) were administered by aerosol, and fevj was measured
3 min after each inhalation. the histamine
concentration was progressively increased until fev! had fallen by more then 20% from
the postsaline value.
fifteen minutes before bronchial provocation with histamine was carried out, skin prick
tests to doubling concentrations of histamine
acid phosphate (4 to 128 mg/ml, 13 to 104
mm/l) were performed. the wheal size at
each concentration was measured after 10 min
by planimetry (30).
during the second phase of the trial the
patients were seen on 4 separate days, 3 h after taking terfenadine 60, 120, or 180 mg or
matched placebo, and the provocation study
was repeated as described for phase 1 but
replacing the histamine with  xxxd2586xxx 
(0.03 to 8 mg/ml, 0.15 to 40.8 mm/l) as the
provocation agonist.
analysis of results
in phase i (histamine challenge), baseline
fevi values were assessed by analysis of variance. for each of the 4 treatment groups, linear regression analysis was carried out on the
fev! values recorded at hourly intervals after dosing, and the slopes thus derived were
compared using analysis of variance. the variation between the groups was further investigated by the newman-keuls procedure. in
phase ii ( xxxd2586xxx  challenge), the baseline values of fevi 3 h after treatment were
similarly compared. after placebo and terfenadine, the fev, response to each concentration of histamine or  xxxd2586xxx  was expressed as a percentage of the postsaline baseline, and values were plotted against the
cumulative agonist concentration on a loga-

rithmic scale. the provocation concentration
of each agonist causing a 20% fall in fevt
(pc20fev) was derived from the linear portion of the concentration response curve by
linear interpolation. histamine- and  xxxd2586xxx -concentration response curves after
the various treatments were analyzed by the
method of fieller (31) to determine if any of
the responses departed significantly from parallel. any protective effect of terfenadine
against the airway effects of histamine and
 xxxd2586xxx  were expressed as a concentration ratio: pc20 value after terfenadine/pc20
value after placebo. differences in concentration ratios between individual terfenadine
doses were assessed by analysis of variance
and the newman-keuls procedure. the histamine skin prick tests were measured as the
total wheal area and compared on each of
the treatment days using the same test. for
individual subjects on each treatment day,
wheal size was plotted against histamine concentration on a logarithmic scale, and
whenever possible the concentration of histamine producing a 20-mm2 wheal (sw20) was
derived by least-squares linear regression. it
was possible to obtain this value only for
placebo and the lowest dose of terfenadine,
and these values were then compared between
treatments usings student's t test for paired
data.
results
in phase 1, no significant differences
were observed between the baseline fe vi
values before administration of placebo
or terfenadine on any of the study days.
however, the rate of change in fevi was

greater after each dose of terfenadine, so
that 2 h after treatment, each of the 3
doses of terfenadine, 60,120, and 180 mg,
produced a small but significant increase
in fevj, amounting to 9.0, 9.5, and
10.0%, respectively (table 1).
after placebo, histamine caused
concentration-related falls in fevi in all
subjects, with a geometric mean pc 20
value of 0.59 mg/ml (range, 0.2 to 1.6).
after each dose of terfenadine, inhaled
histamine also caused concentrationrelated bronchoconstriction. however, in
all subjects and with each terfenadine
dose, the concentration response curves
did not significantly depart from parallel and were displaced to the right (figure 1). the calculated mean concentration ratios with histamine for terfenadine
60,120, and 180 mg, were 14.8 ± 4.6,22.9
± 6.7, and 34.3 ± 8.4%, respectively (figure 2). terfenadine 180 mg was significantly more effective than was 60 mg in
protecting the airways against histamine
(p < 0.05).
after placebo, histamine caused a
concentration-related increase in wheal
area. the 3 doses of terfenadine inhibited
the skin wheal response to histamine,
achieving mean reductions in wheal area
of 46 ± 9.7, 69 ± 10, and 84 ± 8%,
respectively (table 2). terfenadine 180 mg
was significantly more effective than was
the 60 mg dose (p < 0.01). values of sw20
were significantly greater after terfena-

antagonist. metabolite 2 is devoid of any
antihistamine activity.
in addition to protecting against
histamine-induced bronchoconstriction,
terfenadine was shown in the present
study to have bronchodilator activity,
which confirms previous findings (35).
herxheimer (36) was the first to suggest
that antihistamines may have bronchodilator properties by showing that chlorpheniramine when administered intravenously increased the ventilatory function
of asthmatic patients. this observation
was rigorously confirmed by popa (18).
relaxation of basal bronchial tone has
also been reported with inhaled chlorpheniramine (20) and clemastine (19).
the mechanism of bronchodilation
mediated by the older antihistamines is
open to question since many of these
preparations had other pharmacologic
activities including antagonism of muscarinic cholinergic (23), alpha-adrenergic
(37), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors
(38). animal studies both in vivo and in
vitro have shown that terfenadine is free
from these effects at therapeutically relevent tissue concentrations (39) and is also
nonsedative (40,41). in the present study,
bronchodilatation was unlikely to have
resulted from an anticholinergic effect of
terfenadine or its metabolites since we
were unable to demonstrate any effect of
this drug, using a dose as high as 180 mg,
on bronchoconstriction provoked by the
muscarinic cholinergic agonist  xxxd2586xxx . although significant, the degree
of bronchodilatation demonstrated with
terfenadine was small (9 to 10%). this
might reflect our choice of subjects with
mild asthma whose mean baseline pulmonary function was 84% of predicted
and might also explain why a dose response on baseline airway caliber was not
seen (table 2). indeed, both popa (18) and
eiser and associates (16) have shown that
the bronchorelaxant effect of hx receptor antagonists is inversely related to the
severity of the initial bronchoconstriction.
it is well recognized that a drug that
alters baseline airway caliber influences
the position of a constrictor dose response, with an increase in airway caliber affording protection and a decrease
exacerbating agonist-induced bronchoconstriction (42). in the present study,
we have applied the principle suggested
by cheung and coworkers (43) of normalizing the agonist constrictor response
to the postdrug baseline, which removes
the influence of baseline airway caliber
itself on the constrictor response. in the
present study, this was illustrated by the

184

rafferty and holgate

lack of effect of terfenadine-induced
bronchodilation on the position of the
 xxxd2586xxx  response curve (figure 1).
another advantage of normalizing bronchoconstrictor dose-response curves is
that with a change in baseline airway caliber achieved with a drug such as terfenadine, subsequent agonist concentration
response curves do not significantly depart from parallel. it is this feature that
enables the position of the curves to be
described as pc 20 values and drug
potency expressed in terms of a concentration ratio. it should be noted, however, that a drug that produces a parallel
shift of an airway-concentration effect
curve in vivo does not imply a competitive activity on specific receptors of airway smooth muscle, since functional antagonism, for example, produced by a b2receptor antagonist, will have similar effects. in the present study, it is highly
likely that the capacity of terfenadine to
displace the airway caliber-concentration
response curves was mediated through a
specific effect on the hi receptor since
no functional effect was achieved with
this drug when the independent constrictor agonist  xxxd2586xxx  was used.
in conclusion, terfenadine is a potent
and selective antagonist of histamine's
spasmogenic effect on asthmatic airways,
which, when given orally in a dose of 180
mg, is approximately 12, 7, and 2 times
more potent than orally administered
chlorpheniramine 8 mg (23), clemastine
1 mg (44), or  xxxd236xxx  10 mg (45). although it is widely stated that ht receptor antagonists have no role to play in
the treatment of asthma (46), the present and related studies (45, 47) suggest
that this view should be reappraised in
the light of hi antihistamines, such as
terfenadine, which are available with high
potency, specificity, and therapeutic ratios when compared with the older preparations on which statements relating to
asthma therapy were made.
