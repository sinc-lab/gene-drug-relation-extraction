implications of amylin receptor agonism
integrated neurohormonal mechanisms and therapeutic applications
jonathan d. roth, phd; holly maier, phd; steve chen, md; barbara l. roland, phd

a

mylin receptor agonism is emerging as part of an integrated neurohormonal therapeutic approach for managing diabetes mellitus (dm) and body weight.  xxxd2994xxx 
acetate, an analogue of the pancreatic hormone amylin, has been studied in the united
states as an antihyperglycemic agent in patients with type 1 or type 2 dm treated with
mealtime insulin.1 further clinical testing of  xxxd2994xxx  in subjects with obesity demonstrated
that  xxxd2994xxx  monotherapy induced significant, sustained, and dose-dependent weight loss.2
recent clinical observations point to its compatibility as a combination therapy with the hormone
leptin, eliciting double-digit weight loss in patients with overweight and obesity.3 herein, we link
amylin activation of central neural circuits to these therapeutic effects, and we speculate on other
potential therapeutic applications of amylin receptor agonism.
physiologic effects
of amylin
amylin is a 37–amino acid peptide hormone cosecreted with insulin from pancreatic ␤ cells. in rodents and humans,
plasma amylin concentrations rapidly rise
several-fold in response to meals, with a
diurnal profile that is almost superimposable on that of insulin.1 the physiologic
effects of amylin receptor agonism
include (1) decreased food intake, 1,4
(2) slowing of the rate of gastric emptying,1,5 and (3) reduction of postprandial
glucagon release in a glucose-dependent
manner.1,6 through these mechanisms,
amylin receptor agonism reduces the rate
of glucose entry into the bloodstream after meals to better match the ability of insulin to dispose of blood glucose.
amylin binding sites
and neuronal activation
on secretion into the circulation, amylin
binds with high affinity to receptors in the
central nervous system (figure). within
the brain, amylin-specific receptors, which

are composed of the  xxxg321xxx 
partnered with individual receptormodifying proteins, are located in the
nucleus accumbens, the dorsal raphe, and
the hindbrain area postrema.7 there is evidence of specific binding of amylin to receptors located in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal raphe,7 but, because these
areas reside within the blood-brain barrier, it is unlikely that their cognate ligand is circulating amylin. the role of these
binding sites remains to be elucidated.
the amylin neural circuit
area postrema
the area postrema (figure), which lacks
a blood-brain barrier, has a pivotal role in
mediating the physiologic effects of amylin by receiving and integrating peripheral meal-related signals. 8 approximately 90% of neurons in the area
postrema that express amylin-specific receptors also express glucose-sensing receptors.9 in a rat model, lesions in the area
postrema reduced the anorexigenic and
gastric emptying effects of peripherally administered amylin, identifying the area
postrema as an essential location for amy-

lin activity.10,11 similarly, blockade
of endogenous amylin in the area
postrema via central administration of the selective amylin antagonist ac187 increased food intake
and reversed the anorexigenic effects of peripherally administered
amylin. 12 the amylin antagonist
ac187 also raised glucagon concentrations, accelerated gastric emptying of liquids, and increased glycemia after an oral nutrient challenge,
consistent with a central role of amylin in regulating nutrient intake and
use.13

whereas the hindbrain area postrema clearly contains the “firstorder” set of neurons that transduce
the effects of peripheral amylin, amylin affects other areas of the brain via
well-established neural pathways. major reciprocal projections exist between the area postrema, the adjacent nucleus of the solitary tract, and
the lateral parabrachial nucleus
(figure).8 in turn, the lateral parabrachial nucleus projects to the central nucleus of the amygdala.14 these
nuclei seem to be sequentially stimulated (as measured by c-fos, a marker
of neuronal activation) in response to
amylin receptor stimulation in the
area postrema, collectively mediating the anorexigenic effects of amylin. lesions of the area postrema abolish neuronal activation in the lateral
parabrachial nucleus and the central
nucleus of the amygdala,12,15 whereas
lesions of the lateral parabrachial
nucleus abrogate signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala following amylin administration.16
hypothalamus
the importance of amylin in modulating hypothalamic responses to nutritional status and other weight regulatory signals has been established in
several nonclinical studies in lean or
diet-induced obese rodents. in shortterm investigations in lean animals,
peripheral amylin injection reversed fasting-induced c-fos expression in the lateral hypothalamic
area,12 mirroring the effects of refeeding, and downregulated the expres-

outside the blood-brain barrier and contains neurons that are directly activated by peripheral amylin,
propagating signals to the adjacent nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral parabrachial nucleus, and the
central nucleus of the amygdala. lesions in the area postrema abrogate the anorexigenic effects of
amylin, as well as amylin-induced c-fos expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral
parabrachial nucleus, and the central nucleus of the amygdala. while binding is evident in other regions
residing within the blood-brain barrier using ex vivo autoradiography, the cognate ligand for these
binding sites remains to be elucidated. effects of amylin-dependent neuronal activation include reduced
hunger signals, modulation of fasting-induced lateral hypothalamic activation, augmentation of leptin
signaling in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and potential antianxiolytic properties.

sion of lateral hypothalamic orexigenic genes.17 these effects are likely
indirect because amylin binding has
not been reported in this nucleus.18
the anorexigenic effects of amylin
may also include cross-talk with hypothalamic histaminergic signaling
pathways because histaminergic receptor blockade within the ventromedial hypothalamus blunted the anorexigenic effects of amylin.19 finally,
the short-term satiating effect of peripheral amylin was enhanced by central administration of the adiposity
signals leptin or insulin, which act in
the hypothalamus to reduce feeding.20 in diet-induced obese leptinresistant rats, the effects of peripheral amylin treatment were consistent
with enhanced central responsiveness to leptin. amylin-mediated
weight loss (but not caloric restriction) was associated with increased
 xxxg1801xxx  gene expression (a downstream target of leptin
and the precursor of the anorectic ␣msh) within the arcuate nucleus.21 in
addition, whereas vehicle-treated
diet-induced obese rats have diminished hypothalamic leptin signaling, pretreatment with amylin (but
not caloric restriction) for 1 week re-

ventromedial hypothalamus.3
other regions of the brain
it is possible that pharmacologic levels of amylin engage additional neural circuits. rich amylin binding has
been demonstrated in the nucleus
accumbens, a key brain region mediating food reward, suggesting that
amylin signaling may influence hedonic responses to food.22 consistent with this hypothesis, food
choice experiments showed that intake of highly palatable (high-fat or
high-sucrose) foods was selectively
decreased during short- and longterm amylin treatments. 23 however, it is unlikely that endogenous
circulating levels of amylin cross the
blood-brain barrier to directly activate this nucleus. the mechanism of
the role of amylin in food reward remains to be explored.
in summary, these preclinical
findings demonstrate a role for amylin receptor agonism in regulating
blood glucose concentrations and in
integrating feeding-, gut-, and taste-

the integrated information to upstream nuclei involved in energy
balance and possibly mediates food
reward.
current and potential
therapeutic applications
the ability of amylin to stimulate key
neural circuits involved in blood glucose regulation and food intake led
to the investigation of amylin analogues as treatments for metabolic
diseases. herein, we highlight how
amylin-dependent activation of
neural circuits can be leveraged in
the treatment of dm and potentially in obesity and neuropsychiatric diseases.
diabetes mellitus
diabetes mellitus is characterized by
hyperglycemia resulting from defects in the secretion or action of
multiple hormones, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, and glucagonlike peptide 1. dysfunction of pancreatic ␤ cells is a core defect in dm
that results in reduced (type 2 dm)
or absent (type 1 dm) secretion of
insulin and amylin in response to
food intake. insulin therapy is a common treatment for patients with dm.
however, many patients who use insulin are unable to maintain adequate glycemic control perhaps in
part because of the continued dysregulation of other hormones such
as amylin.
 xxxd2994xxx , an analogue of human amylin, was developed to overcome several physicochemical properties that make human amylin
unsuitable for pharmacologic delivery. by mimicking the aforementioned neurohormonal actions of
amylin,  xxxd2994xxx  complements
the actions of insulin by regulating
the presence of glucose in the circulation via slowed gastric emptying, reduced food intake, and decreased postprandial glucagon
secretion. 1 in clinical investigations of patients with type 1 or type
2 dm,  xxxd2994xxx  reduced glycated hemoglobin and postprandial glucose excursions with a concomitant reduction in insulin
dosage, improving overall glycemic control compared with insulin

treatment alone.1 in addition,  xxxd2994xxx  treatment generally led to
weight loss, while insulin treatment tended to promote weight
gain.1 the most frequent treatmentemergent adverse events with  xxxd2994xxx  use were mild to moderate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and
nausea, which decreased over time.
collectively, findings from these
studies suggest that  xxxd2994xxx  in
combination with insulin provides
a physiologic approach to the treatment of dm by mimicking the effects of amylin.
obesity
results of preclinical investigations suggest that amylin may be
useful for treating obesity.24 amylin administered peripherally to rodents decreased meal size and increased the ratio of postmeal interval
to meal size (a measure of satiety in
humans) without any indication of
malaise (kaolin intake, locomotor activity, or taste aversion).23,24 reductions in food intake and body weight
have been maintained for up to 11
weeks of treatment with continuous peripheral amylin administration in rat models of diet-induced
obesity.23 the weight-reducing effects of amylin are dose dependent,
are not associated with compensatory decreases in energy expenditure, and are attributed to the loss
of fat mass with relative preservation of lean mass.3,21,23,25 whereas reduced food intake is the predominant mechanism of overall weight
loss, pair-feeding investigations demonstrate that amylin-treated rats lose
more fat than would be predicted
due to caloric restriction alone.21
these preclinical findings with
amylin, along with the observation
that  xxxd2994xxx  therapy reduced
body weight in patients with insulintreated dm, pointed to its potential
clinical usefulness as an antiobesity agent. in subjects with obesity,
 xxxd2994xxx  elicited significant
weight loss in the absence of lifestyle intervention.26,27 when used in
conjunction with lifestyle intervention,  xxxd2994xxx  use led to greater
initial weight loss compared with
placebo (ⱕ5.7% vs 2.6% at 4
months) and longer maintenance of
weight loss (ⱕ7.9% vs 1.1% at 12

(reprinted) arch  xxxd122xxx  / vol 66 (no. 3), mar 2009
308

months).2 the most common adverse event in these studies was mild
to moderate nausea, which decreased over time.
monotherapies that target a single
aspect of the multihormonal dysregulation associated with obesity may be
limited in efficacy by compensatory
mechanisms that favor weight maintenance and regain. for example,
weight loss and energy restriction (as
encountered during dieting or with
drug treatment) trigger a cascade of
events to defend body weight, including a fall in leptin level (due to
fat loss), decreased sympathetic
nervous system activity, increased
muscle work efficiency, reduced energy expenditure and metabolic rate,
increased hunger, and decreased satiety and fullness.28 there is a growing consensus that overcoming these
compensatory mechanisms will require combination therapies that target multiple mechanisms regulating
body weight. our translational obesity research program has recently explored the following 2 combinatorial strategies: (1) amylin-leptin
agonism to harness short-term satiety and long-term adiposity signaling and (2) amylin receptor agonism combined with approved smallmolecule anorectics that act via
classic neurotransmitter systems.
preclinical studies demonstrated
synergistic weight and fat loss when
amylin was coadministered with leptin in rats with diet-induced obesity3,29 and additive weight loss when
amylin was coadministered with the
small-molecule anorectics sibutramine hydrochloride or  xxxd2913xxx .30 in a randomized double-blind clinical proof-ofconcept study 3 in subjects with
overweight and obesity, coadministration of  xxxd2630xxx  and  xxxd2994xxx  acetate for 20 weeks (after a
4-week lead-in treatment period with
 xxxd2994xxx  alone) elicited significantly more weight loss (approximately 13%) than either treatment
alone. in a randomized 24-week
single-blind study31 (only the subjects were blinded to study medication), the combination of  xxxd2994xxx  with sibutramine or phentermine
significantly increased weight loss
(approximately 11 kg) compared
with  xxxd2994xxx  monotherapy (approximately 4 kg). the safety pro-

files in both of these studies were consistent with those of the individual
treatments, suggesting that targeting multiple pathways through the
combination of an amylin agonist and
centrally acting anorectic agents may
lead to enhanced weight loss without the emergence of unexpected adverse events. together, the findings
of these studies suggest that a combinatorial approach that includes  xxxd2994xxx  may successfully override
the central nervous system mechanisms for defending body weight.
neuropsychiatric disease
amylin activation of central neural
circuits may also have therapeutic
potential in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. it is increasingly clear that the neural circuitry
modulating energy homeostasis
interacts and even overlaps with circuits involved in cognition, reward, and stress.32 hence, the peptides and proteins propagating these
signals may have beneficial emotional or behavioral effects, as well
as effects on metabolic (or energyrelated) processes.
in preclinical studies, amylin receptor agonism has recently been associated with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. long-term stress
triggers a dietary imbalance that increases palatable feeding and visceral obesity through resetting of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis.33,34 when standard chow and
sucrose were made freely available
to rats, amylin administration not
only decreased preference for sucrose but also prevented stressinduced sucrose consumption fol-

lowing restraint stress.35 in models
of depression and anxiety, amylin
decreased immobility in the forced
swim test, reduced marble burying,
increased the number of crossings in
the 4-plate test, and attenuated the
hyperthermic response to restraint
stress, which was blocked following lesioning of the area postrema. 36,37 furthermore, stressinduced c-fos activation in central
circuits was reduced with amylin
treatment.36 although these intriguing preclinical observations require clinical validation, they suggest that the integrated mechanisms
of amylin may improve metabolic
and behavioral processes.
conclusions
the direct and indirect effects of
amylin receptor agonism are summarized in the table. in addition to
its known therapeutic effects on glycemic control in patients with type
1 or type 2 dm using insulin, amylin receptor agonism is emerging as
a novel potential therapy for obesity as monotherapy or in combination therapy. it is increasingly clear
that activation of the amylin neural
circuit may have usefulness beyond the treatment of metabolic diseases. nonclinical evidence suggests therapeutic potential of amylin
in neuropsychiatric diseases. further research on amylin receptor
agonism in several other therapeutic areas is clearly warranted. recent efforts to develop additional
amylin analogues have indicated that
it is possible to enhance specific
amylin actions. for example, the
amylin analogue ac2307 was re-

cently shown to be more potent
and to elicit greater weight loss
relative to native amylin in nonclinical investigations.38 to what
extent specific amylin actions can
be individually optimized to treat
various disease states remains to be
determined.
