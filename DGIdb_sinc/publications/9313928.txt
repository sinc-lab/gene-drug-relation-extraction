1 eight types and subtypes of the mouse prostanoid receptor, the prostaglandin d (dp) receptor, the
prostaglandin f (fp) receptor, the prostaglandin i (ip) receptor, the thromboxane a (tp) receptor and
the ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  subtypes of the  xxxd1903xxx  receptor, were stably expressed in chinese
hamster ovary cells. their ligand binding characteristics were examined with thirty two prostanoids and
their analogues by determining the ki values from the displacement curves of radioligand binding to the
respective receptors.
2 the dp, ip and tp receptors showed high ligand binding speci®city and only bound their own
putative ligands with high anity such as  xxxg1073xxx , bw245c and bw868c for dp, cicaprost,  xxxd2331xxx  and
isocabacyclin for ip, and s-145, i-bop and gr 32191 for tp.
3 the  xxxg1878xxx  bound  xxxd1902xxx  and ¯uprostenol with ki values of 3 ± 4 nm. in addition,  xxxg1073xxx , 17phenyl-pge2, sta2, i-bop, pge2 and m&bá-28767 bound to this receptor with ki values less than
100 nm.
4 the  xxxg1872xxx  bound 17-phenyl-pge2, sulprostone and  xxxd2331xxx  in addition to pge2 and  xxxd124xxx ,
with ki values of 14 ± 36 nm. 16,16-dimethyl-pge2 and two putative ep1 antagonists, ah6809 and sc19220, did not show any signi®cant binding to this receptor. m&b-28767, a putative ep3 agonist, and
misoprostol, a putative  xxxg1873xxx /ep3 agonist, also bound to this receptor with ki values of 120 nm.
5 the  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors showed similar binding pro®les. they bound 16,16-dimethyl pge2 and
11-deoxy- xxxd124xxx  in addition to pge2 and  xxxd124xxx . the two receptors were discriminated by butaprost, ah13205 and ah-6809 that bound to the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor but not to the  xxxg1875xxx , and by 1-oh- xxxd124xxx  that
bound to the  xxxg1875xxx  but not to the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor.
6 the  xxxg1874xxx  showed the broadest binding pro®le, and bound sulprostone, m&b-28767,
gr63799x, 11-deoxy- xxxd124xxx , 16,16-dimethyl-pge2 and 17-phenyl-pge2, in addition to pge2 and  xxxd124xxx ,
with ki values of 0.6 ± 3.7 nm. in addition, three ip ligands,  xxxd2331xxx , carbacyclin and isocarbacyclin, and
one tp ligand, sta2, bound to this receptor with ki values comparable to the ki values of these
compounds for the ip and tp receptors, respectively.
7 8-epi- xxxd1902xxx  showed only weak binding to the ip, tp, fp,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1874xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mm
concentration.

introduction
prostanoids, which consist of prostaglandins and thromboxanes are metabolites of  xxxd208xxx  (samuelsson et al.,
1978), and exert a variety of actions in the body through
binding to speci®c cell surface receptors. the prostanoid receptors include the dp, ep, fp, ip and tp receptors, which
preferentially bind prostaglandin d (pgd), pge, pgf, pgi
and thromboxane a (txa), respectively. moreover, the ep
receptor has four subtypes, the ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors. these receptors have been characterized pharmacologically by comparing the potencies of agonists or antagonists in
various tissue preparations from dierent species (coleman et
al., 1990; 1994b). for example, the ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx 
receptors have been characterized in the guinea-pig ileum, cat
trachea, chick ileum and piglet saphenous vein, respectively
(coleman et al., 1994a). however, these preparations usually
contain more than one type or subtype of these receptors, and
it is well known that prostanoids and their analogues often act
on several types or subtypes of receptors (coleman et al.,
1990). thus, it is usually dicult to evaluate the potencies of

various compounds for a particular type of receptor in a tissue
preparation. the ligand binding characteristics of the prostanoid receptors have also been studied biochemically by using
radiolabelled prostanoids in various tissues. however, the expression levels of these receptors are low in many preparations.
this, in addition to the expression of multiple types and subtypes of receptors, sometimes hinders the accurate evaluation
of their ligand binding speci®cities. it is also known that there
is species dierence in both the ligand sensitivities and the
tissue distribution of the prostanoid receptors. for example,
the  xxxg2253xxx  of rabbits diers from that of man, cats, and
canines in its response to two agonists, cta2 and pta2 (burke
et al., 1983), and to an antagonist, ono-11120 (narumiya et
al., 1986). it has also been found that prostanoid-induced
bronchocontraction is mediated by dierent types or subtypes
of receptors in dierent species. it is mediated by the ep1 and
tp receptors in the guinea-pig, by the fp and tp receptors in
the dog, and by the  xxxg2253xxx  only in man (for a review see
coleman et al., 1990). these species dierences further complicate the characterization of these receptors.
we have cloned eight types and subtypes of the mouse
prostanoid receptor (sugimoto et al., 1992; 1994; namba et al.,

218

m. kiriyama et al

1992; 1994; honda et al., 1993; watabe et al., 1993; hirata et
al., 1994; katsuyama et al., 1995). this has enabled the
homogeneous expression of each type of receptor of the same
species at a high expression level, and has made the systematic
analysis of the ligand binding characteristics of the prostanoid
receptors possible. in this study, we have examined the ligand
binding speci®cities of mouse prostanoid receptors stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells by use of thirty
two prostanoids and their analogues. we have also analysed
the binding of an isoprostane, 8-epi- xxxd1902xxx , to these receptors.
8-epi- xxxd1902xxx  is a representative member of the recently identi®ed isoeicosanoids (morrow et al., 1990; 1994). although 8epi- xxxd1902xxx  has been shown to exhibit biological activities such
as vasoconstriction, the mitogenesis of smooth muscle cells and
the inhibition of platelet aggregation (takahashi et al., 1992;
morrow et al., 1992; fukunaga et al., 1993), it remains unclear
whether this compound acts on prostanoid receptors.

methods
stable expression of the prostanoid receptors and ligand
binding assay
the cho cell lines stably expressing the dp, ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3,
 xxxg1875xxx  and  xxxg1879xxx  have been described previously (sugimoto
et al., 1992; watabe et al., 1993; hirata et al., 1994; namba et
al., 1994; nishigaki et al., 1995; katsuyama et al., 1995). the
establishment of the cell lines expressing the tp and fp receptors was performed as previously described (sugimoto et
al., 1992). brie¯y, a 2.4 kb ecori fragment of the  xxxg1878xxx 
cdna (sugimoto et al., 1994) or an ecori fragment of the tp
receptor cdna ml36 (namba et al., 1992) were subcloned
into pdkcr-dhfr, an eukaryotic expression vector containing
a mouse  xxxg631xxx  gene as the selection marker.
the plasmids were then transfected into cho-dhfr7 cells de®cient in  xxxg631xxx  activity by the lipofection
method. cell populations expressing the fp or  xxxg2253xxx 
together with  xxxg631xxx  were selected in amodi®cation of eagle's medium (a-mem) lacking ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. clonal cell lines expressing
each receptor were then isolated by single-cell cloning.
each line of cho cells was cultured to near con¯uency in amem containing 10% foetal calf serum. after the cells were
washed with dulbecco's phosphate buered saline without
divalent cations (pbs(7)), they were harvested with pbs(7)
containing 5 mm edta. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 25 mm
tris.hcl, ph 7.5, 10 mm mgcl2 1 mm edta and 0.1 mm
phenylmethylsulphonyl ¯uoride. the membranes were prepared as previously described (namba et al., 1994). the tp,
ip, dp, fp receptors and the four subtypes of the ep receptors
were assayed as [3h]-s-145, [3h]- xxxd2331xxx , [3h]- xxxg1073xxx , [3h] xxxd1902xxx  and [3h]-pge2 binding activities, respectively. scatchard analyses were performed in an assay mixture containing
25 mm tris.hcl, ph 7.0, 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta, 0.1 mm
phenylmethylsulphonyl ¯uoride, 100 mg protein of each cho
cell membrane and various concentrations of the respective
radioligands in a total volume of 200 ml. nonspeci®c binding
was determined as the binding in the presence of over 500 fold
excess of non-labelled ligand over the respective radioligand.
incubation was carried out at 308c for 60 min except for the
experiments with membranes expressing the dp receptor; these
experiments were performed at 48c for 120 min, because incubation at 308c caused high nonspeci®c binding of [3h] xxxg1073xxx  to this membrane (hirata et al., 1994). incubation was
terminated by the addition of ice-cold 5 mm tris hcl, ph 7.0.
the mixture was ®ltered in vacuo through a whatman gf/c
®lter. the ®lter was washed with the above buer ®ve times,
except for the assay of the  xxxg1872xxx  binding, which was
washed twice. the radioactivity on the ®lter was then determined in triton-toluene scintillator (ushikubi et al., 1989). in
the displacement experiments, various concentrations of

binding specificities of the prostanoid receptors

compounds were included in the assay mixture in the presence
of each radioligand, which was used at concentrations two fold
over the kd value obtained from the scatchard analysis.

data analysis and presentation
the radioligand binding data were analysed by prism ii, a
computer programme (graphpad software, inc., san diego,
u.s.a.). each data point derived from at least three separate
experiments was analysed. the kd and bmax values were determined by scatchard analyses. the displacement of the
radioligand binding to each receptor was then examined for
thirty two prostanoids and their analogues. competitive
binding curves were constructed on log concentration scales of
these compounds, and the hill slopes were calculated. the ki
values were calculated from the log (ic50) from the equation:
ki=ic50/(1+[l]/kd), where [l] and kd are the concentration
and dissociation constant of the radioligand, respectively
(cheng & pruso, 1973), and are expressed as the mean with
95% con®dence intervals. for some compounds, which did not
have enough data showing over 50% displacement for the
computer analysis, the displacement curves were constructed
manually, and the ki values were calculated from the ic50
values obtained from these curves. for these compounds
which did not show over 50% displacement at a 10 mm concentration, the percent displacement at this concentration was
shown.

(mean+s.e.mean; n=3). the expression level of each prostanoid receptor was 700+8, 200+8, 610+31, 715+18,
275+10, 620+8, 610+13 and 5500+290 fmol mg71 protein
for the dp, ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3,  xxxg1875xxx , fp, ip and tp receptors,
respectively. the kd values obtained corresponded well to
values obtained previously (sugimoto et al., 1992; 1994;
namba et al., 1992; 1994; honda et al., 1993; watabe et al.,
1993; hirata et al., 1994; katsuyama et al., 1995), and the
receptor expression levels were high enough to evaluate their
ligand binding speci®cities by displacement experiments. the
displacement experiments were performed at least three
times for each receptor, and then analysed. a summarized
analysis for the  xxxg2253xxx  is shown in figure 2. a log(ic50) value with 95% con®dence intervals was then determined from each displacement curve, and a ki value with
95% con®dence intervals was calculated. these results are
summarized for the eight types and subtypes of receptor in
table 1. the % displacement at a 10 mm concentration is
shown for those compounds which displaced less than 50%
of the radioligand binding at this concentration (table 2).
hill slopes were also obtained from the displacement curves,
and are shown in table 3. most of them were around 0.8,
suggesting slight negative co-operativity, which may be due
to inappropriate g-protein coupling as suggested by neubig
et al. (1985).

prismii to examine the appropriateness of the scatchard
analysis. as shown in figure 1 for the  xxxg2253xxx , the

the rank order of anity of ligands for the dp receptor was
pgd24bw868c, bw245c4sta2. their ki values were 21,
220, 250 and 1600 nm, respectively (table 1). the dp receptor
showed high anity only for  xxxg1073xxx  and the anities for
bw868c and bw245c were relatively low. this diers from
the properties described for the cloned human dp receptor,
which bound both compounds with almost the same anities
as for  xxxg1073xxx  (boie et al., 1995). in the rabbit jugular vein,
bw686c showed a pkb of 8.7 for bw245c-induced relaxation
(giles et al., 1989). these results may re¯ect species dierences
in the dp receptor.
 xxxg1073xxx  bound to the  xxxg1878xxx  with an anity comparable
to that for the dp receptor; a ki value of 47 nm (table 1). this
indicates that  xxxg1073xxx  may act on the  xxxg1878xxx . in fact,
 xxxg1073xxx -induced bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized dog
has been suggested to be mediated by the  xxxg1878xxx  (cole-

the data are presented for ligands which displaced over 50% of their respective radiogland  xxxd1891xxx  mm. the values indicate ki values with

ono13014carbacyclin4411-deoxy- xxxd124xxx . their ki values
were 10, 11, 15, 16, 33, 47, 110 and 1000 nm, respectively
(table 1). this is in good agreement with the reported rank
order of potency of ligands, cicaprost, iloprost4carbacylin, on
platelets from several species (armstrong et al., 1989). high
anities of isocarbacyclin,  xxxd319xxx  and ono-1301 for the
receptor have already been described (kajikawa et al., 1989;
tanaka et al., 1995; yamasaki et al., 1995).
interestingly, all of the ip ligands used in this study bound
to the  xxxg1874xxx  with ki values ranging from 22 to 740 nm
(table 1). among these ligands,  xxxd2331xxx , carbacyclin and
isocarbacyclin showed anities comparable to those found for
the  xxxg1879xxx . this result suggests the possibility that ip ligands act on this receptor. in fact, carbacyclin was shown to
act on the  xxxg1874xxx  (sonnenburg & smith, 1988). only
 xxxd2331xxx  also bound to the  xxxg1872xxx  (table 1); the actions
of this compound on the  xxxg1872xxx  have been obtained
previously (dong et al., 1986).

the  xxxg2253xxx  and tp ligands
the rank order of anity of ligands for the  xxxg2253xxx  was ibop, s-1454gr32191, sq29548, sta24u-46619. their ki
values were 0.56, 0.68, 12, 13, 14 and 67 nm, respectively
(table 1). this rank order and ki values correspond well to
those found previously. for example, morinelli et al. (1989)
obtained the rank order of i-bop4sq295484sta24u46619, with respective ic50 values of 2.2, 4.7, 17, 62 nm in
ligand binding competition experiments on human platelets.
other ligands known to act on other types of prostanoid receptor had no anity for this receptor, except for m&b-28767,
which showed anity for the  xxxg2253xxx . m&b-28767 bound
to the receptor with a ki value of 1300 nm. it has been found

that  xxxg1073xxx  and  xxxd1902xxx -induced bronchoconstriction in man is
mediated by the  xxxg2253xxx  (coleman et al., 1989). it has also
been found that  xxxd1902xxx  and pge2 contract the rat aortic ring
via the  xxxg2253xxx  (dorn et al., 1992). however,  xxxg1073xxx ,
 xxxd1902xxx  and pge2 showed no anity for the  xxxg2253xxx  in the
mouse.
thus, the  xxxg2253xxx  is quite speci®c for the putative tp
ligands. on the other hand, sta2 bound to the ep3,  xxxg1873xxx  and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors with ki values of 23, 220 and 350 nm, respectively (table 1). i-bop bound to the fp, ep3 and  xxxg1873xxx  receptors with ki values of 100, 100 and 220 nm, respectively (table
1). although tp ligands have not been shown to act on these
receptors, this result should be taken into consideration when
performing experiments with these compounds.

the  xxxg1878xxx  and fp ligands
the  xxxg1878xxx  bound only  xxxd1902xxx  and ¯uprostenol with high
anity; their ki values were 3.4 and 3.7 nm, respectively. some
prostanoids can cross-react with this receptor, but with at least
a ten fold lesser anity than the two compounds along with a
rank order of  xxxg1073xxx , 17-phenyl-pge2,4sta2, i-bop, pge2,
m&bá-28767416, 16-dimethyl-pge2, sulprostone4u-46619,
19r(oh)-pge2. their ki values were 47, 60, 97, 100, 100, 124,
350, 580, 1000 and 1000 nm, respectively (table 1). the ®nding
that a variety of non-fp ligands showed relatively high binding
anities for this receptor indicates that the ligand binding
speci®city of the  xxxg1878xxx  is broader than previously suspected.
on the other hand,  xxxd1902xxx  bound to the ep3 and ep1 receptors with ki values of 75 and 1300 nm, respectively. fluprostenol bound only to the  xxxg1878xxx , indicating the high
selectivity of this ligand.

the  xxxg1872xxx  and ep ligands
the rank order of anity for the  xxxg1872xxx  was 17phenyl-pge2, pge2, sulprostone, iloprost4pge14misoprostol, m&b-28767411-deoxy-pge14pgf2a. their ki values were 14, 20, 21, 21, 36, 120, 120, 600 and 1300 nm,
respectively (table 1). some ep agonists such as 16,16-dimethyl-pge2, gr-63799x, butaprost, 1-oh- xxxd124xxx  and ah
13205 did not show any signi®cant binding to this receptor.
sc-19220 and ah-6809, known as antagonists for the ep1
receptor, showed no anity for the mouse  xxxg1872xxx ; this
suggests that there are species dierences. this result is
important when subtypes of the ep receptor in mouse tissues are examined, because these compounds are frequently
used to determine if a pge action is mediated by the ep1
receptor. although 17-phenyl-pge2 is considered to be a
relatively speci®c agonist for the  xxxg1872xxx , it bound to
the  xxxg1874xxx  with higher anity than that to the ep1
receptor (table 1).

the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor and ep ligands
the rank order of anity of the ep ligands for the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor was  xxxd124xxx , pge2, 16, 16-dimethyl-pge2411-deoxypge14butaprost4ah13205, misoprostol4ah-6809. their
ki values were 10, 12, 17, 45, 110, 240, 250 and 350 nm, respectively (table 1). in addition, this receptor bound two tp
ligands, i-bop and sta2, and one ip ligand, isocarbacyclin,
with low anity; their ki values were 220, 220 and 1000 nm,
respectively. 19r(oh)-pge2 was shown to be a speci®c agonist for the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor (woodward et al., 1993). however,
this ligand showed no anity for the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor, and had
only weak anity for the  xxxg1878xxx . butaprost showed af®nity only to the  xxxg1873xxx  receptor, indicating its high selectivity for

this receptor. no signi®cant binding was observed with other
ep agonists such as 17-phenyl-pge2, sulprostone, m&b28767, gr-63799x or 1-oh- xxxd124xxx .

the  xxxg1874xxx  and ep ligands
the  xxxg1874xxx  bound most of the ep ligands used in this
study with a rank order of anity of sulprostone, m&b-28767,
pge2,  xxxd124xxx , 11-deoxy- xxxd124xxx , gr63799x, 16,16-dimethylpge2, 17-phenyl-pge24misoprostol, ah1320541-ohpge1. their ki values were 0.60, 0.68, 0.85, 1.1, 1.5, 1.9, 1.9,
3.7, 67, 82 and 330 nm, respectively (table 1). in addition, this
receptor bound three ip ligands,  xxxd2331xxx , carbacyclin and
isocarbacyclin, and one tp ligand, sta2, with ki values
comparable to ki values of these ligands for their respective
receptors. the  xxxg1874xxx  also bound two other ip ligands,
 xxxd319xxx  and cicaprost, with ki values of 110 and 170 nm,
respectively. furthermore, it bound  xxxd1902xxx , i-bop and  xxxg1073xxx 
with ki values of 75, 100 and 280 nm, respectively. these
®ndings are in good agreement with the agonist order of potency of some of these compounds in rabbit cortical collecting
tubule cells, pge2,  xxxd124xxx , 16,16-dimethyl-pge24carbacyclin,
pgf2a4pgd2 (sonnenburg & smith, 1988). although sulprostone, m&b-28767, 16,16-dimethyl-pge2 and 11-deoxypge1 also bound to other receptors, they showed the highest
anities for this receptor (table 1). sulprostone showed anities for both ep1 and fp receptors. m&b-28767, which is
known to be an ep1 and  xxxg1874xxx  agonist, also bound to
the  xxxg1878xxx  with a ki value of 124 nm. 11-deoxy- xxxd124xxx 
showed anities to the  xxxg1873xxx ,  xxxg1875xxx  and fp receptors. misoprostol, known as an  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1874xxx  agonist, showed ki
values of 120, 250, 67 and 67 nm for the ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx 
receptor, respectively (table 1). ah13205, a known  xxxg1873xxx  agonist, also bound to the  xxxg1874xxx  with better anity. gr-

63799x, on the other hand, showed high anity only to the
 xxxg1874xxx , indicating its high selectivity for this receptor.

the  xxxg1875xxx  and ep ligands
the rank order of anity of the ligands for the  xxxg1875xxx 
was pge2, pge1411-deoxy- xxxd124xxx , 16, 16-dimethyl-pge2,
misoprostol41-oh- xxxd124xxx , gr-63799x, m&bá-28767417phenyl-pge2. their ki values were 1.9, 2.1, 23, 43, 67, 190,
480, 500 and 1000 nm, respectively (table 1). this rank order
is in good agreement with previous ®ndings. for example, the
rank order of potency was pge244misoprostol4gr63799x44ah13205 for the  xxxg1875xxx  in the foetal rabbit
ductus arteriosus, and the equieective molar ratios of these
ligands were 1, 145, 685 and 4100,000, respectively (smith et
al., 1994). these same values for the mouse  xxxg1875xxx  were
1, 59, 294 and 42000, respectively (table 1). in addition to
these ep ligands, sta2 bound to this receptor with a ki value
of 350 nm.

binding of 8-epi- xxxd1902xxx  to the prostanoid receptors
8-epi- xxxd1902xxx  has been shown to have several biological actions
and the addition of a  xxxg2253xxx  antagonist was found to
block some of its actions (fukunaga et al., 1993; pratico et al.,
1996). we analysed the anity of 8-epi- xxxd1902xxx  for the prostanoid receptors by examining its activity in displacing radioligand binding on each receptor. 8-epi- xxxd1902xxx ,  xxxd1891xxx  mm,
displaced only less than 50% of the bound radioligands from
some receptors (table 2). thus, the anity of 8-epi- xxxd1902xxx  for
the prostanoid receptors was much lower than the prostanoids
themselves and their analogues.
in this study, we used cho cells stably expressing each of
the cloned prostanoid receptors, and characterized the binding
properties of eight types and subtypes of the prostanoid receptor to 32 prostanoids and their analogues. of the eight
types and subtypes of receptor, the dp, ip and tp receptors
showed strict ligand binding speci®city; they only bound their
own putative ligands. these ligands also generally showed selective binding to their own receptors, although some of the ip
ligands bound to the ep3 and ep1 receptors, a tp ligand,
sta2, bound to the  xxxg1874xxx , and  xxxg1073xxx  to the  xxxg1878xxx . the  xxxg1878xxx  showed a little wider binding pro®le,
and bound  xxxg1073xxx , pge2 and sta2 with ki values of 47 ±
100 nm. among the ep receptors, the ep1,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors showed relatively strict ligand binding speci®cities in
that they bound almost only ep ligands, though most of these

binding specificities of the prostanoid receptors

223

ligands bound to more than one subtype of the ep receptor.
on the other hand, the  xxxg1874xxx  showed a very broad
ligand binding pro®le, ranging from ip and tp ligands to ep
ligands. these binding properties of the prostanoid receptors
may re¯ect their molecular evolution. toh et al. (1995) suggested that the primitive form of the prostanoid receptor is the
receptor for pge2 involved in  xxxd1773xxx  metabolism, from
which three clusters of receptors have evolved. the ®rst cluster
is composed only of the  xxxg1874xxx , the second of the dp,
 xxxg1873xxx ,  xxxg1875xxx  and ip receptors, and the third of the ep1, fp and tp
receptors. the versatile binding property of the  xxxg1874xxx 
found in this study and its multiple signal transduction pathways created by alternative splicing (namba et al., 1993)
suggest that the  xxxg1874xxx  may re¯ect the general properties
of the ancestral prostaglandin receptor.
the present study examined only the binding characteristics
of the prostanoids and their analogues to the prostanoid receptors, and did not examine their functional potencies. although the rank order of binding anities for some of the
compounds identi®ed in this study is in good agreement with
their rank order of potency in some systems, it is expected that
the two rank orders will dissociate in some instances as already
shown for pge2 and m&b-28767 on the  xxxg1874xxx . although these two compounds show almost identical binding
anities, the m&b compound was one hundred times more
potent in inhibiting the  xxxd1773xxx  response than pge2
(narumiya et al., 1993). these points will be clari®ed by future
studies, especially for those compounds that bind to receptors
other than their own, as demonstrated in this study.
in conclusion, we have used an expression system for cloned
prostanoid receptors and performed a systematic analysis of
their ligand binding speci®cities. this study has revealed a
broad array of their ligand binding properties, some of which
were not known before. this information can be utilized in
analysing prostanoid actions in various systems and the expression system used here could contribute to the screening
and development of potent and selective prostanoid agonists
and antagonists.
