abstract

 xxxd3094xxx  ( xxxd3094xxx ™), a fentanyl derivative, is an ultra-short acting, nonspecific
esterase-metabolised, selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, with a pharmacodynamic profile typical of opioid analgesic agents. notably, the esterase linkage in
 xxxd3094xxx  results in a unique and favourable pharmacokinetic profile for this
class of agent.
adjunctive intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  during general anaesthesia is an effective
and generally well tolerated opioid analgesic in a broad spectrum of patients,
including adults and paediatric patients, undergoing several types of surgical
procedures in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.  xxxd3094xxx  is efficacious
in combination with intravenous or volatile hypnotic agents, with these regimens
generally being at least as effective as fentanyl- or alfentanil-containing regimens
in terms of attenuation of haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic intraoperative
responses, and postoperative recovery parameters. the rapid offset of action and
short context-sensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx , irrespective of the duration of the
infusion, makes the drug a valuable opioid analgesic option for use during
balanced general inhalational or total intravenous anaesthesia where rapid, titratable, intense analgesia of variable duration, and a fast and predictable recovery are
required.

1. pharmacological profile
 xxxd3094xxx  ( xxxd3094xxx ™)2, a selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, demonstrates typical opioid agonist
effects, including analgesia,[1-4] respiratory depres-

sion[5-7] and haemodynamic effects[8-10] (e.g. decreased heart rate and blood pressure). in terms of
analgesic intensity, the lack of response to surgical incision and management of intraoperative
stress,  xxxd3094xxx  exhibited similar potency to

fentanyl[10-12] and appeared to be 16- to 70-fold[13,14]
more potent than alfentanil in adult healthy volunteers and surgical patients. naloxone,[10-12] but not
norbinaltorphimine,[12] antagonised the effects of
 xxxd3094xxx . in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients, haemodynamic effects were not associated with the release of
histamine.[15] the drug has a rapid onset of analgesic
action (1 minute) and fast offset of action (3–10
minutes vs 5–20, 20–30 and 180–240 minutes, respectively, with alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine).[5,9,10,16,17]  xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced no clinically relevant effects on intraocular or
intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity or cerebral
capacity.[18-25] in association with volatile or intravenous anaesthetic agents,  xxxd3094xxx  demonstrates typical opioid-induced hypnotic sparing effects.[26-31] the primary metabolite of  xxxd3094xxx 
(gr90291) exhibits ≈300- to 4600-fold less activity
than the parent compound.[13,32,33]
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  exhibits a linear, dosedependent pharmacokinetic profile in surgical patients and in healthy volunteers.[5,34,35] the drug is
rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the
body (mean volume of distribution at steady state
[vdss] 260–415 ml/kg) and is ≈70% bound to plasma proteins.[36]  xxxd3094xxx  rapidly crosses the placental barrier, but is quickly metabolised and/or
redistributed in the neonate.[37] the drug readily
crosses the blood-brain barrier.[35]
 xxxd3094xxx  is rapidly (mean terminal elimination half-life [t1/2beta] ≈10 minutes) and extensively
metabolised by nonspecific blood and tissue esterases to the relatively inactive carboxylic acid metabolite gr90291.[13,35,38,39] this metabolite is eliminated mainly (≥88% of the dose) in the urine,[5,39] with
mean t1/2beta values ranging from 88.1 to 137.4 minutes
following bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx  2–30 mug/
kg.[35] the mean clearance (cl) rate of  xxxd3094xxx 
exceeded the average hepatic blood flow by ≈3- to
4-fold.[35] the pharmacokinetic profile of
 xxxd3094xxx  is unlikely to be affected by inherited or
acquired deficiencies in plasma cholinesterases.[36]
the context-sensitive half-time of  xxxd3094xxx  was

of other mu-opioid receptor agonists.[5,17,34,35,40]
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients had similar mean vd of the
central compartment (vdc) and distribution half-life
values to those of alfentanil recipients; however, the
mean cl value was ≈5-fold greater and the mean
t1/2beta was ≈6-fold shorter with  xxxd3094xxx  treatment
(no statistical data reported).[5]
there were no clinically relevant differences in
the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug in those with
renal or hepatic impairment,[38,41-44] or based on gender.[45] during the hypothermic phase (core body
temperature 28–30°c) of cardiopulmonary bypass,
the mean clearance of  xxxd3094xxx  was reduced by
≈20%.[46] in surgical patients aged 0 to <18 years,
after correction for bodyweight, there were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters
of  xxxd3094xxx  in these recipients versus those in
adults.[47] between the age of 20 and 85 years, vdc
and cl values decrease by ≈25% and 33% in
healthy adult volunteers,[45] requiring a 50% reduction in the initial and subsequent doses of
 xxxd3094xxx  in those >65 years of age.[39] these
pharmacokinetic parameters are also reduced by
about one-third in obese versus lean patients;[48]
reductions in dose in obese recipients should be
based on the patient’s ideal bodyweight.[39]
2. therapeutic efficacy
intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  in combination with
volatile or intravenous hypnotic agents provided
effective analgesia and attenuated responses to various stimuli during the induction and/or maintenance
of general anaesthesia in a broad spectrum of surgical patients in several comparative, randomised
clinical trials. as per therapeutic recommendations,
bolus doses of  xxxd3094xxx  were typically 0.5–1 mug/
kg, with infusion rates of 0.2–0.5 mug/kg/min; higher
infusion rates (1–2 mug/kg/min) were used in patients
undergoing ‘fast-track’ coronary artery bypass graft
surgery (cabg).
during induction of anaesthesia in adult patients
undergoing various surgical procedures,  xxxd3094xxx  attenuated the stress response to intubation, and
facilitated endotracheal intubation without a muscle
relaxant.[49-55]  xxxd3094xxx  also facilitated laryngecns drugs 2005; 19 (12)

(tiva).[56] in morbidly obese patients,  xxxd3094xxx 
was as effective as alfentanil or fentanyl in blunting
the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation
using propofol-based tiva.[57]
in surgical patients,  xxxd3094xxx -containing regimens were generally at least as effective as fentanyland alfentanil-containing regimens during the induction and/or maintenance of balanced general
anaesthesia, as assessed by various intraoperative
responses and postoperative recovery parameters.[58-60] for instance, in a large (≈2500 inpatients
and outpatients) single-blind trial, relative to
fentanyl recipients,  xxxd3094xxx -treated patients responded to verbal commands faster (after both inpatient and outpatient surgery) and, after day surgery,
recovered faster and were discharged from hospital
sooner.[60] notably, haemodynamic profiles in response to intraoperative stimuli were generally better and postoperative functional abilities improved
at a faster rate in  xxxd3094xxx  than fentanyl recipients.[60] in a large double-blind trial, significantly
fewer  xxxd3094xxx  than alfentanil recipients responded to intraoperative surgical stimuli (primary
endpoint), intubation or skin incision.[58] typically,
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced effective analgesia and attenuation of intraoperative responses
irrespective of their age (including paediatric[61-66]
and elderly[67,68] patients), bodyweight,[69] the degree
of renal or hepatic impairment,[70] type (e.g. major
abdominal surgery,[58,59,62,66] cabg,[71-75] neurosurgery,[76-79] ear, nose and throat,[63,64] or opthalmic[65]
surgery) and duration of surgery being undertaken,
whether the drug was combined with intravenous[80-83] or volatile hypnotic agents,[80,82,83] or
whether the drug was used in the inpatient[60] or
outpatient[60,84,85] setting. limited data also suggested that intravenous  xxxd3094xxx  was an effective
opioid analgesic during caesarean section, with
generally no significant difference in apgar or neurologic and adaptive capacity scores at most timepoints in neonates born to mothers receiving a
 xxxd3094xxx - versus a fentanyl-based anaesthetic
regimen in a small single-blind trial.[86]

3. tolerability
bolus doses and/or infusions of intravenous
 xxxd3094xxx  were generally well tolerated as a component of induction-[50,80,87] and maintenance-regimens[58,63-66,73,74,77,80,81,83,84] for general anaesthesia
in adults and children undergoing surgery. common
adverse events associated with  xxxd3094xxx  treatment during the perioperative period, such as muscle rigidity (0–8%), bradycardia (2–12%), hypotension (6–30%), nausea (12–47%), vomiting (3–33%)
and shivering (6–26%), are typical of those reported
with all mu-opioid receptor agonists and resolved
rapidly upon discontinuation of the drug or reduction in the infusion rate and/or with appropriate
treatment.[58,65,66,73,74,77,80,81,83,84]
the nature of adverse events occurring in
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients was generally similar to that
seen in fentanyl recipients,[73,74,77,88] although hypotension occurred significantly more frequently in
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients (inpatients [18% vs 7%], outpatients [9% vs 3%]) in a large (n = 2438) singleblind trial.[88] a significantly higher percentage of
 xxxd3094xxx  recipients experienced at least one
drug-related adverse event in the overall population
(21% vs 11% of fentanyl recipients) and in subgroup
analyses of inpatients (34% vs 16%) and outpatients
(26% vs 9%).[88] there were no between-group differences in the intensity of these adverse events,
with 3% of patients in each group experiencing at
least one severe adverse event.[88] there was no
intergroup difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea in either patient populations, although
postoperative vomiting occurred significantly more
frequently in  xxxd3094xxx  recipients undergoing
outpatient surgery (15.5% vs 12.5%).[60]
there was no between-group difference in the
nature of treatment-related adverse events in
 xxxd3094xxx  groups compared with alfentanil
groups, although some individual events occurred
with a higher incidence.[58,65,66,78,84] eighty-two percent of  xxxd3094xxx  recipients and 75% of alfentanil
recipients experienced at least one adverse event in
the largest trial (n = 234), with a significantly higher
incidence of hypotension (30% vs 10% of patients)
