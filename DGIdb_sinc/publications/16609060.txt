chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations in
advanced melanoma
keith t. flaherty

abstract

for three decades, clinical trials with chemotherapy in melanoma have failed to show superiority of
any one regimen over another.  xxxd1796xxx  remains the only ‘‘standard’’agent.with response rates
of <10% and median progression-free survival of 2 months or less in contemporary trials, there
is a need to improve systemic therapy. combination chemotherapy is associated with higher
response rates than single-agent therapy but this has not translated into improved survival. an
increasing number of potential therapeutic targets have been identified. for some, pharmacologic
inhibitors are available, including sorafenib for braf, farnesyltransferase inhibitors for  xxxg1605xxx ,
 xxxd2856xxx  for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase,
rapamycin analogues for  xxxg1478xxx , and agents that inhibit either vascular
endothelial growth factor or its receptors. several multitargeted kinase inhibitors have potency
against the fibroblast growth factor receptor, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.
small-molecule inhibitors of c-met and akt are in preclinical development. another class of agents
indirectly affect aberrant signaling, including inhibitors of chaperones and proteasomes. several
targeted agents seem to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in preclinical models.
the mechanism by which signaling inhibition might synergize with chemotherapy requires more
study so that rational combinations move forward. very few targeted agents have been studied
rigorously in this fashion.

the

effect of systemic therapy on survival for patients with
advanced melanoma remains unproven. combination regimens, containing multiple chemotherapeutic agents, multiple
biological agents, or both, have not improved survival compared with single-agent therapy (1). the best-studied singleagent chemotherapies for melanoma have objective response
rates of <20%, with complete responses observed in <5% of
cases (2).
for the purposes of this article, the term chemotherapy is
intended to include drugs that induce cell death by interfering
with a vital cellular structure or process. admittedly, the line
between targeted therapy and chemotherapy is increasingly
blurred as we dissect the mechanisms of chemotherapy and
some of the newer agents. the most logically consistent definition of targeted therapies might be those agents for which the
molecular target was known as the compound was selected
from drug screens. even this discriminator is flawed but it
serves as a point of departure for the following commentary.
although one can speculate about rational combinations of
targeted therapy with chemotherapy, a thorough preclinical
evaluation is rarely done to justify a particular drug develop-

ment program. in fact, most current clinical trials in melanoma,
combining a novel targeted agent with a chemotherapeutic
agent, use  xxxd1796xxx . this is neither the most rational nor
the most efficacious approach to build new and more useful
combinations. it would be preferable to have a combination of
agents for which the selection is scientifically grounded. not all
chemotherapies cause the same intracellular consequences,
allowing for the possibility that the signaling effects of
nontargeted chemotherapy could be used to advantage in
combination with certain targeted signaling inhibitors.

targeting antiapoptotic mediators
bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx , ‘‘ xxxg2432xxx ,’’ and nearly
all members of the bh3-only class of antiapoptotic proteins
have been reported as overabundant in melanoma and may
confer resistance to chemotherapy (3). it is not clear that any
one antiapoptotic protein functions as a master suppressor of
apoptosis in melanoma. therefore, the therapeutic value of
inhibiting a single member of this large protein family in
melanoma is a matter of speculation.
oblimersen, an antisense oligonucleotide against bcl-2
mrna, has been tested extensively in clinical trials. this agent
had been shown preclinically to down-regulate bcl-2 mrna
and to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. in a phase
1/2 trial among patients with advanced melanoma, the downregulation of bcl-2 in tumor biopsy specimens was shown for
most patients (4). data from this small trial were the basis for a
phase 3 trial among 771 patients with metastatic melanoma
(5). the failure of this trial to show a survival advantage by
the addition of bcl-2 antisense to  xxxd1796xxx  compared with

chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations

 xxxd1796xxx  alone leaves more questions than answers. was the
amount of bcl-2 down-regulation shown in the phase 1/2 trial
sufficient to provide the anticipated sensitization to chemotherapy? is there a subpopulation of melanoma patients for
whom this strategy would be of particular value? lacking the
ability to answer these questions with clinical data or
correlative study of the patients’ tumors, one is left to conclude
that the drug is ineffective and that the target may be invalid.
the latter would require the demonstration that more complete
inhibition of bcl-2 lacks chemosensitizing activity. as inhibitors of other antiapoptotic proteins, including  xxxg251xxx , are
developed clinically, some of the questions raised by the bcl-2
antisense trials will reappear.

targeting oncogenes and downstream signaling
pathways
in the shadow of the success with imatinib in chronic
myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors,
melanoma awaits effective molecularly targeted therapy. the
question that remains unanswered is whether melanoma is
more like chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor or more like the prevalent cancers that lack a
defining somatic genetic event. braf is the most frequently
mutated oncogene identified to date in melanoma, present in
60% to 70% of cases (table 1; ref. 6). this serine-threonine
kinase mediates signaling through the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) pathway. immediately upstream of
braf is  xxxg1605xxx , which is mutated and constitutively activated in
another 15% of melanomas (7). given that the two events are
mutually exclusive, a striking 75% to 85% of melanomas harbor an activating mutation in this pathway. the less frequent
activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (15%)
and amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (20%) leave the mapk as a deserving focus of targeted
therapy strategies (8, 9). soon after braf mutations were
described in metastatic melanoma, a similarly high frequency
of braf mutations was reported in benign nevi (10). the
therapeutic value of agents that target the mapk pathway is still
uncertain.  xxxg1605xxx  inhibition remains a therapeutic challenge.
the only clinical agents used to date that affect ras activity are
the farnesyltransferase inhibitors. these agents impair the
posttranslational modification of the ras proteins and prevent
their membrane localization, which is required for signaling
activity (11). clearly, farnesylation is not a process that is
limited to the ras proteins; thus, this class of agents is surely
limited by lack of specificity. nonetheless, in preclinical models
and in limited correlative studies in clinical trials, there is
evidence that ras activity is impaired by farnesyltransferase

inhibitors (12). in pancreatic cancer, where kras mutations are
present in 95% of cases, farnesyltransferase inhibitors have
little, if any, activity (13). yet to be determined is whether more
effective ras inhibition would produce more significant antitumor effects. the therapeutic value of farnesyltransferase
inhibitors is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 trial. combination studies with farnesyltransferase inhibitors and chemotherapy in an  xxxg1605xxx  mutant population seem justified by
preclinical data (14).
because activating mutations in braf allow the kinase to
remain constitutively active irrespective of upstream  xxxg1605xxx 
activity,  xxxg1605xxx  is an unattractive target in braf mutant melanoma. raf inhibition is a focus of several ongoing clinical
trials, but significant gaps in our knowledge exist. the only
agent with braf inhibitory activity that has reached clinical
trials is sorafenib. this agent was selected for clinical development before braf was identified as an oncogene relevant to
melanoma and is most potent against craf (15). nonetheless,
the homology in the atp binding sites of the raf kinases
provides for potent cross-reactivity against braf. even later in
the clinical development of sorafenib, it was found to be a
potent inhibitor of  xxxg2413xxx  receptors.
its activity against braf remains the focus of interest in the
context of melanoma.
in preclinical models, depletion of mutant braf with rna
interference in melanoma cells that harbor the mutation
inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in cell culture (16).
however, this same method of depleting braf fails to entirely
abrogate the growth capacity of these same cells when xenografted into an immunodeficient mouse (17). these data suggest that in a tumor environment more representative of the
human disease, melanomas that harbor braf mutations have
accessory signaling pathways that can sustain growth. nonetheless, in these experiments, the melanoma cells deprived of
mutant braf grew less rapidly than unaltered melanoma cells.
although small interfering rna experiments are a precise
method of interrogating a therapeutic target, they poorly represent the effects of pharmacologic inhibition.
in melanoma cell lines, sorafenib induces cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis (18). the activity of the mapk is clearly inhibited.
mirroring the small interfering rna data, however, sorafenib
administration to an immunodeficient mouse bearing a mutant
braf melanoma xenograft only slows tumor growth compared
with controls. fewer animal studies have addressed the
question of whether sorafenib is effectively blocking the mapk
pathway while failing to regress the xenografts.
in clinical trials, single-agent sorafenib has been associated
with few objective responses and a modest degree of tumor
stabilization (19). the rationale for combining sorafenib with
chemotherapy derives from preclinical studies conducted
in vitro and in animal models. sorafenib has been shown to
synergize with the proapoptotic stimulus adaphostin in a broad
range of tumor cell lines (20). likewise, sorafenib enhances the
activity of a broad range of chemotherapeutics in xenograft
models. relatively little investigation of this interaction has
been conducted in melanoma models but some evidence of
chemotherapy sensitization has been reported (18).
two clinical trials combining sorafenib with chemotherapy
are completed or in progress. rigorous preclinical studies to
identify the most appropriate chemotherapy partner for sorafenib have not been conducted. the most extensively evaluated

combination has been that of sorafenib with carboplatin and
paclitaxel (21). these two chemotherapy agents have long been
known to induce synergistic results in nonmelanoma models
and enhancement of the activity of each agent by sorafenib has
been observed in nonmelanoma models. in a large, single-arm
phase 2 trial, this regimen was associated with an objective
response rate and progression-free survival that far exceeds that
reported in similarly large trials of other agents in melanoma.
considering that most patients in this trial had progressed
during prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease, the results
of this trial are encouraging.
how this regimen addresses the therapeutic value of braf
inhibition remains unclear. the clinical outcome of patients
with braf mutations was nearly identical to that of patients
without braf mutations in their tumors. this has led some to
speculate that the enhancement of chemotherapy effects by
sorafenib might derive from its effect on factors other than
braf. the likely antiangiogenic effect of vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor inhibition is one obvious consideration.
we have thus studied the effect of single-agent sorafenib on
mapk pathway activity and tumor perfusion as a surrogate for
antiangiogenic effect (22, 23). among a subset of patients who
underwent serial tumor biopsies or dynamic contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging, we found evidence that the mapk
pathway is inhibited and tumor perfusion is significantly
decreased. thus, both mechanisms seem manifest. further
study is required to determine which one predominates and in
which subpopulation of patients. with more intensive correlative studies, the next generation of clinical trials with sorafenib
should shed more light on this area.
a randomized phase 3 trial comparing this regimen with
the chemotherapy agents alone is currently under way. this
double-blind trial among 800 patients with metastatic melanoma will definitively address the contribution of sorafenib to
this chemotherapy. in parallel, a phase 2/3 trial combining
sorafenib with  xxxd1796xxx  is ongoing. as with the carboplatin
and paclitaxel regimen, there is no scientific basis on which this
doublet is founded. in a preliminary report of the ongoing trial,
the objective response rate seems to exceed that expected for
 xxxd1796xxx  alone (7). a randomized trial comparing sorafenib
and  xxxd1796xxx  to  xxxd1796xxx  alone is currently accruing
patients. these two randomized trials are well powered and
should establish or refute this combination chemotherapy
strategy.
considering the preclinical data summarized herein and the
clinical experience to date, it is uncertain whether agents that target
braf more specifically and more potently will be of greater or
lesser value. with these open questions remaining from the
development of sorafenib, such agents are soon to enter the clinic.
an alternative strategy to targeting braf is the inhibition of
mek (mapk/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase), the
immediate downstream signaling component in the mapk
pathway. preclinical data support the induction of apoptosis
in vitro and xenograft growth inhibition in vivo (25). the only
clinical evidence in melanoma comes from a recently reported
phase 1 trial of  xxxd2856xxx  in which melanoma patients were
well represented (26). serial biopsies were attempted on all
patients to investigate target inhibition. nearly all patients had
nearly complete inhibition of the mapk pathway. yet only 2 of
27 melanoma patients showed objective responses. whereas
the data are very immature, lacking even braf mutation status

clin cancer res 2006;12(7 suppl) apri 1, 2006

of the patients, one is left with the preliminary conclusion that
inhibiting mapk/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
will be insufficient to alter the natural history of the majority of
melanoma patients. a single-agent phase 2 trial is under way
and includes patients with melanoma. based on preclinical
data, the combination of mek inhibition with chemotherapy is
justified (25) but remains to be clinically investigated.
the clinical experience with inhibitors of mammalian target
of rapamycin, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
h as single agents have not yielded objective responses in the
context of phase 2 trials.  xxxd3307xxx , a selective inhibitor of
 xxxg1478xxx , was associated with little
evidence of clinical activity in melanoma (27). nonetheless,
this agent and other rapamycin analogues have been shown to
affect their targets in vivo. the lack of single-agent antitumor
efficacy does not preclude a chemotherapy-enhancing effect,
which is suggested by preclinical studies.  xxxd2333xxx  is
an agent that is potent against both c-kit and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor h, targets that are worthy of study based
on preclinical evidence (28, 29). single-agent imatinib was
not associated with significant activity in phase 2 trials in
melanoma (30). again, the value of this agent in combination
with chemotherapy is unknown. unlike other agents discussed
in this review, imatinib seems to have limited capacity for
combination with chemotherapy due to an enhancement of
myelosuppression presumably derived from c-kit inhibition.
inhibitors of c-met, akt, and the fibroblast growth factor
receptor are well justified for clinical investigation based on
their role in melanoma biology (31 – 33). inhibitors of these
signaling mediators are in preclinical development and, in
the case of fibroblast growth factor receptor, early clinical
development. no data exist about their clinical utility in
melanoma.

indirect strategies for targeting aberrant
signaling
the inhibition of protein chaperones and proteasomes is a
distinct area of clinical investigation. it is more difficult to
justify the rationale for these agents as specific melanoma
therapies. however, there is evidence that inhibition of heat
shock proteins and proteasomes can inhibit the growth of
melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo (34, 35).
the  xxxd2187xxx  derivatives 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17demethoxy- xxxd2187xxx  are currently in clinical development
for numerous types of cancer, but experience in melanoma is
lacking. given the fact that heat shock protein 90, the primary
target of these agents, is involved in the posttranslational
modification of numerous client proteins, their therapeutic
index in melanoma remains difficult to predict. although it has
been speculated that heat shock protein 90 inhibition might
selectively target mutant braf for degradation, there is
evidence both in support of and against this hypothesis (34).
the proteasome inhibitor bortezimib has been studied
preclinically in melanoma and seems to enhance the cytotoxicity of temozolomide in vitro and in vivo (35). in melanoma
and in other tumors, evidence suggests that the indirect effects
of this agent on nf-nb correlate with the antitumor effects of
this agent (36, 37). it is clear that nf-nb inhibition is a target
of therapeutic interest in melanoma but it is unclear whether

chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations

bortezimib acts via this mechanism. although temozolomide
may not be a rational partner for this agent, data are sufficiently
promising to warrant clinical investigation and a phase 1/2 trial
of this combination is ongoing.

conclusions
the list of potential therapeutic targets in melanoma is
growing at a faster pace than the clinical development of agents
against them. faced with a backlog of agents and somewhat
limited resources for conducting thorough clinical investigations, the selection of agents and regimens with strong
preclinical rationale must take precedence over empirical
motivations. confronted with apparent biological relevance of
mapk pathway mutations in melanoma, efforts to target this
signaling axis deserve increased focus. the preclinical and early
clinical data suggest that this single pathway may not be the
achilles heel of the disease. perhaps melanoma will never be
found to have such a susceptible point of intervention as
gastrointestinal stromal tumor and chronic myelogenous
leukemia. chemotherapy serves as the readily available and,
at this time, best-justified partner for signaling inhibition in the
current generation of trials. the choice of chemotherapy
partners for targeted therapy requires a rigorous preclinical
justification as the empirical choice of  xxxd1796xxx  or temozolomide may neglect important mechanistic interactions. whereas this strategy is being validated or refuted, the hope that
signaling inhibitors can be combined with each other toward a
greater therapeutic effect remains and will require the attention
of the next generation. the exploration of targeted therapy
combinations is limited by legal and regulatory impediments.
given the unique ability of the cancer therapeutics evaluation
program to sponsor such trials, it is imperative that emerging
targeted agents be included in the cancer therapeutics
evaluation program portfolio.

open discussion
dr. atkins: do you want to comment about the correlative
science plans for the intergroup trial with sorafenib that’s going
forward?
dr. flaherty: a total of 800 patients are going to be
randomized into this trial: 400 to carboplatin-taxol alone
and 400 to sorafenib with the chemotherapy. we get to study
what chemotherapy does or doesn’t do and in whom it does
and doesn’t work. harriet kluger at yale is using a tissue
microarray-based method, wherein a small piece of a paraffinembedded tumor will be taken to look at a diverse array of
protein and phospo-protein markers. we’re going to be looking
at proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. we’re going to be
looking at  xxxg2413xxx  pathway elements
and predictors of outcome. what we’ve also proposed, and

we’ve just got a score that’s going to require at least one
revision to get funded, is a genetic study looking at the known
players:  xxxg1605xxx , braf, and the tumor suppressors pten, p16,
and  xxxg169xxx . we will look for mutation, amplification, and
then loss of the tumor suppressors, in particular.
dr. sosman: do you treat only patients with the target or do
you go in with an open mind but make sure you treat patients
with the target?
dr. flaherty: failing a compelling treatment for the other
group, we feel you should keep it open and then make sure that
you’re able to determine who the people are who have the
target and who don’t. since it’s common to have a braf
mutation, you can interrogate that population with 400
patients on one arm of the study. understanding the relevance
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition and
braf wild-type melanoma needs to be the focus.
dr. atkins: what do you think is the mechanism of the
increased sensitivity to chemotherapy in the b-raf wild-type
versus a b-raf mutant melanoma population?
dr. flaherty: gavin robertson has published data suggesting
that braf mutations (this is, again, in cell lines and so has yet to
be validated) would be associated with a greater angiogenic
drive. there is higher  xxxg2413xxx 
production in vitro. we would like to determine in our tumor
samples if there is a relationship between braf mutation and
higher immature fraction of vessels and other things that we
think are more believable statements of angiogenesis. i would
have expected the braf mutant tumors and probably the  xxxg1605xxx 
mutant tumors as well to have more robust responses, but
maybe not if they’ve got such a drive to angiogenesis.
dr. atkins: todd golub’s model had two different classes
of melanomas; one of these groups was microphthalmiaassociated transcription factor driven. i’m not sure how that
would relate to mutations in braf. if you could analyze and
divide into those two subsets, would you think there would
be one that would be more sensitive to braf inhibition than
the other? would that be worth looking at in the context of
these targeted therapies, as well as immunotherapy?
dr. haluska: that is a specific weakness of array experiments.
they look at expression patterns but that is relatively
disconnected from either activating mutations or tumor
suppressor loss. neither of those is shown in the analyses.
often, there is no independent classic genetics that allows one
to look at the known involved genes in concert. curiously, in
franco marincola’s fine needle aspirations, one of the
prominently identified genes was pten, which usually doesn’t
come up with the others. but the short answer to your question
is, i don’t know.
dr. elder: one mechanism for activating the pathway is
extracellular autocrine loop receptor  xxxg2198xxx  signaling.
there are data from meenhard herlyn’s lab that this is actually
active in the mutated state as well (38).
