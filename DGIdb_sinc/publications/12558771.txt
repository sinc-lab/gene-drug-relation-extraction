ergotamine and dihydroergotamine:
history, pharmacology, and efficacy
stephen d. silberstein, md, facp; douglas c. mccrory, md

ergotamine and dihydroergotamine share structural similarities with the adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurotransmitters. as a result, they have wide-ranging effects on the physiologic processes that they mediate. ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are highly potent at the 5-ht 1b and  xxxg1110xxx   xxxd2022xxx  receptors and,
as a consequence, the plasma concentrations that are necessary to produce the appropriate therapeutic and physiologic effects are very low. the broad spectrum of activity at other monoamine receptors is responsible for their
side effect profile (dysphoria, nausea, emesis, unnecessary vascular effects). both ergotamine and dihydroergotamine have sustained vasoconstrictor actions. in acute migraine treatment, their mechanisms of action involve constricting the pain-producing intracranial extracerebral blood vessels at the 5-ht 1b receptors and inhibiting the
trigeminal neurotransmission at the peripheral and central 5-ht 1d receptors. the scientific evidence for efficacy is
stronger for dihydroergotamine than for ergotamine. their wide use is based on long-term experience.

both e and dhe have pronounced activity at monoaminergic receptors; their  xxxd2022xxx  efficacy is
probably due to their agonist activity at 5-ht1b,
 xxxg1110xxx , and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors. their side effect profiles are secondary to their agonist activity at 5-ht1a,
5-ht2a, and dopamine d2 receptors. the pharmacologic specificity of the ergot alkaloids can be significantly increased if their dosages and plasma concentrations are carefully controlled.
the vasoconstrictor action of e and dhe was
long believed to be the basis of their clinical effects.
however, recent advances in the understanding of the
pathophysiology and pharmacology of migraine suggest that their inhibitory effects on trigeminal nerves
(blocking neurogenic inflammation in peripheral
meningeal tissues and nociceptive neuronal transmission centrally in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis) may
also contribute to their  xxxd2022xxx  efficacy.1

efficacy; in some systems they are agonists while in

(dhe) is a semisynthetic, hydrogenated ergot alkaloid, synthesized by reducing an unsaturated bond in

resulted in an ergot derivative with greater alphaadrenergic antagonist activity and reduced vasoconstrictor and emetic potential. dihydroergotamine has

both oral and rectal preparations (cafergot,  xxxd404xxx ).
caffeine is widely believed to improve the absorption
and effectiveness of e. dihydroergotamine has long
been available as a parenteral preparation, suitable
for intravenous (iv), intramuscular (im), or subcutaneous (sc) administration and is now available as an
intranasal (in) formulation. the american academy
of neurology and a european consensus have published recommendations on e use.2,3
we review the history of e and dhe, their receptor pharmacology,  xxxd2022xxx  mechanisms of
action, efficacy, and adverse events. we attempt to answer several questions. first, are ergot drugs, alone or
in combination with other agents, effective in treating
acute migraine head pain? are the various e combination drugs more efficacious than e alone in treating
acute migraine head pain or its associated nausea and
vomiting? are there important differences among
the combinations in these respects? finally, how do
ergots and e-containing combinations compare with
other alternative treatments for migraine?

history
the earliest reports on the use of ergot in the
treatment of migraine were those of von eulenburg
of germany in 1883,4 thomson of the united states
in 1894,5 and campbell of england in 1894.6 the first
pure ergot alkaloid, e (trade name  xxxd2022xxx ), was
isolated by stoll in 1920.6  xxxd2022xxx  was used primarily in obstetrics and gynecology to control postpartum hemorrhage until 1925, when rothlin successfully treated a case of severe and intractable migraine
with an sc injection of et.7 this resulted in e becoming the cornerstone of migraine treatment. ergotamine’s migraine indication was pursued vigorously by various researchers over the following decades
and,8,9 due to its potent vasoconstrictor properties, reinforced the belief in a vascular origin for migraine.10,11 lennox in boston and others independently conducted the first controlled studies of et in
1934.10 lennox also showed that injected e was more
effective than oral e, thus confirming the poor oral
bioavailability of these compounds.12 ergotamine, despite having been the classic treatment for migraine
headache for the past 5 decades, has several drawbacks. first, absorption is erratic for both oral and

145
rectal forms. second, significant side effects (nausea,
vomiting, and peripheral vasoconstriction) are common, and ergotism may result from prolonged use,
excessive doses, or even therapeutic doses in sensitive individuals. finally, prolonged or excessive use
of e and most acute headache medications may lead
to a cycle of drug tolerance and dependence.
dihydroergotamine was synthesized (using hydrogenation [reduction] of the double bond at the 910 position of the ergoline ring of e) by stoll and
hofmann in 1943.13 dihydroergotamine was originally envisaged as an antihypertensive agent, but it
was later shown to be highly effective in treating migraine. dihydroergotamine was first used to treat migraine in 1945 by horton, peters, and blumenthal at
the mayo clinic.14-17 in 1986, raskin and callaham reconfirmed the effectiveness of dhe for both intermittent and intractable migraine.18,19 the use of dhe
was reviewed by scott in 1992.20 in 1997, a nasal spray
version was approved for use in migraine.20
both dhe and et are effective for the acute
treatment of migraine, but dhe has fewer side effects. dihydroergotamine is less nauseant and emetic
than e (a considerable advantage in view of the nausea and vomiting associated with migraine) and has
considerably less vasoconstrictor effects. dihydroergotamine also appears to be relatively free of the
risk of chronic rebound headaches that is associated
with most acute migraine treatment. indeed, since
dhe is much less of a vasoconstrictor than e but has
comparable  xxxd2022xxx  efficacy, it has been suggested that other mechanisms must be involved in its
 xxxd2022xxx  effects.21,22

pharmacokinetics of ergotamine
and dihydroergotamine
ergotamine and dhe have low bioavailability
and are subject to substantial (greater than 90%)
first-pass metabolism by the liver following oral administration; as a result very little of the unchanged
parent drug reaches the systemic circulation.23-26 however, several of the metabolites of e and dhe have
biologic activity similar to that of the parent drug and
are often present in concentrations several times
higher than that of the parent compound.27,28 ergotamine and dhe are strongly sequestered by tissues,

which could contribute to the persistence of biologic
effects well after the parent drug or metabolites can
no longer be detected in plasma.25,29 table 1 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of e and dhe
obtained in studies with normal volunteers.1
 xxxd2022xxx  is rapidly but incompletely
and variably absorbed after oral (approximately 1%),
rectal (1% to 2%), or im (47%) administration.23,24,30
peak plasma levels are attained approximately 1
hour after oral or rectal administration.23,31 plasma
levels are highest following rectal administration.31
caffeine enhances the absorption of et following
oral administration.32
little is known about the tissue distribution of e
in humans. the drug is apparently distributed into
the cerebrospinal fluid.33 following oral or iv administration in rats, e is distributed in high concentrations in the liver and lung and in lower concentrations
in the kidney, heart, and brain.34 ergotamine is extensively metabolized by the liver. following oral administration, it is rapidly cleared from the blood by
first-pass hepatic metabolism. ergotamine and its
metabolites are excreted principally in the feces via
biliary elimination (greater than 90%).33 only a small
amount of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine.35
a second peak plasma concentration has been observed in some studies after about 48 hours, which
suggests enterohepatic recirculation.26 elimination of
e follows a biphasic pattern, with mean half-lives of
approximately 10 minutes and 3.4 hours.31
dihydroergotamine.—dihydroergotamine mesylate has very low oral bioavailability (less than 1%),

less than that of et due to a high first-pass metabolism and incomplete drug passage across the gastrointestinal mucosa.36 the absolute bioavailability of
intramuscular dhe is 100%.37 the absolute bioavailability of dhe following in administration is approximately 40%.37,38 peak plasma levels occur approximately 1 to 2 minutes after iv administration,
24 minutes after im administration, and 30 to 60 minutes after in administration. intranasal dhe administration, which avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism,
delivers adequate plasma concentrations of the drug
and eliminates the need for parenteral administration.34 little is known about the tissue distribution of
dhe in humans. following oral or iv administration
in rats, dhe is distributed in high concentrations in
the liver, lung, and kidney and in lower concentrations in the stomach, intestine, and brain.34 like e,
dhe is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the
liver. only 6% to 7% of an im dose is excreted in the
urine. the major route of elimination is the feces following biliary excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites. dihydroergotamine has many metabolites;
only those that retain the essential ring structures of
the ergot alkaloids (the ergoline ring and the peptide
side chain) are active. the major metabolite is 8-oh
dhe which is present at a concentration 5 to 7 times
greater than that of dhe. the pharmacologic effects
of the active metabolites are qualitatively similar to
those of the parent compound.27 dihydroergotamine
is eliminated in a biphasic manner, with mean halflives of approximately 0.7 to 1 and 10 to 13 hours.37,38
the long half-life may account for the low headache
recurrence rate observed in dhe-treated patients.
the pharmacokinetics of dhe are summarized in
table 1.

receptor pharmacology
of ergotamine and
dihydroergotamine
there are multiple 5-ht receptors that have varied
biologic effects.39 at least 7 classes and 14 5-ht receptor subtypes exist. all 5-ht receptors are linked
to g proteins, except for the  xxxg1116xxx , which is
linked to an ion channel. ergotamine and dhe have
high affinity for the 5-ht1a, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx , and  xxxg1112xxx ,
5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor subtypes. they

have low affinity for the  xxxg1111xxx  receptor. in addition,
they bind to receptors in the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems (table 2). it is likely that the beneficial effects of e and dhe arise from their agonist
properties at 5-ht1b, 5-htid, and perhaps 5-htif receptors that lead to meningeal vasoconstriction and
trigeminal inhibition.
the unwanted side effects of e and dhe probably arise from actions at central 5-htla receptors
(nausea and dysphoria) and dopamine d2 receptors
(nausea and vomiting). ergotamine and dhe have
complex inhibitory or excitatory actions at vascular
adrenergic receptors and have agonist activity at constrictor 5-ht2a receptors. these actions may underlie
their peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. both dhe
and e can cause vasoconstriction by stimulating alphaadrenergic and 5-ht2a receptors, although e is a
much more potent vasoconstrictor than dhe.38,40
both can antagonize the actions of norepinephrine
(ne) and 5-ht.41 both are venoconstrictors via their
action on alpha-adrenoceptors.42,43 the interactions
between either e or dhe and ne depend upon receptor reserve and vasomotor tone, showing both
agonist and antagonist effects in different vascular
beds.44,45 the peripheral vascular effects of e are
more pronounced than the selective 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonist (triptans), since the triptans do not have
activity at adrenergic and 5-ht2a receptors.

 xxxd2022xxx  actions
proposed mechanisms include constriction of
large capacitance arteries, closure of arteriovenous
anastomoses, inhibition of neurogenic inflammation,
and blockade of transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis.39,46,47 an initial hypothesis was that e
and dhe targeted the cerebral vasculature, based on
the belief that migraine was a vascular disorder. lauritzen and olesen measured serial cerebral blood
flow (cbf) during migraine utilizing xenon 133 with
single photon emission computed tomography.48
they found that cbf decreases during migraine with
aura, but does not change in migraine without aura.
while the aura developed, cbf progressively decreased as a wave of spreading oligemia, which began
in the occipital cortex, moved forward at a rate of 2 to
3 mm per minute. these blood flow changes are consistent with a primary neuronal event causing secondary vascular changes. no change in cbf occurs after
et or dhe administration.49,50 while particular vascular beds may be idiosyncratically affected, the consensus is that cbf is not significantly altered by et
or dhe and their effect in migraine is independent
of any change in cbf.49-51
constriction of meningeal arteries.—it has been
suggested that the headache of migraine could result
from dilation of the large pain-producing conductance intracranial arteries and its relief from their

148
constriction. since the resistance vessels would not be
affected, there is no marked change in cbf. while
balloon inflation of the middle cerebral artery produces focal headache, the relevance of this painful
experimental vasodilation to migraine is uncertain.
indeed, dilation of the middle cerebral artery during
a migraine attack is not a consistent finding using
transcranial laser doppler techniques and migraine is
not relieved by all vasoconstrictors that are active in
the middle meningeal vessels (eg, ne). nonetheless,
the 5-ht1 agonists such as e and dhe (and the triptans) constrict meningeal blood vessels through their
agonist activity at the 5-ht1b receptors that are preferentially expressed in intracranial extracerebral arteries; this could contribute to their pharmacologic action by decreasing activation of perivascular trigeminal
sensory nerves.52

cardiovascular safety profile
ergotamine and dhe can constrict coronary
blood vessels through actions at 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a
receptors that are present on coronary artery smooth
muscle. there are more 5-ht1b receptors in the
meningeal arteries than there are in the coronary arteries, and so the ergots retain selectivity for cranial
over coronary blood vessels. the affinity of the ergots at constrictor 5-ht2a receptors is at least 20-fold
lower than the affinity at  xxxd2022xxx  5-ht1b and
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors, giving a therapeutic window (see
table 3). all current and prospective serotonin 5ht1 agonist  xxxd2022xxx  drugs, including the triptans, e, and dhe, contract coronary artery ring segments in vitro but all are partial agonists compared to
the endogenous ligand, serotonin, and all have similar minimal effects at clinically relevant concentrations. however, the contractile response to e and dhe
is prolonged relative to the newer  xxxd3263xxx  5-ht1b/1d receptor selective  xxxd2022xxx  agents.53
inhibition of neurogenic inflammation.—the
trigeminal nerve innervates the cranial blood vessels.
the trigeminal sensory c fibers contain the neurokinins  xxxg2240xxx  (sp),  xxxg2240xxx , and calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp). experimental stimulation of the trigeminal nerve causes release of sp,
cgrp, and  xxxg2240xxx  from the sensory c fibers
and a delta fibers, resulting in neurogenic inflamma-

february 2003
tion and meningeal vasodilation.54 the released neuropeptides interact with mast cells (further releasing
histamine) and with the blood vessel wall, producing
dilation, plasma extravasation, platelet activation,
and sterile inflammation. this sterile inflammatory
process is believed to sensitize nerve fibers to respond to previously innocuous stimuli such as blood
vessel pulsations.
the ergot alkaloids inhibit the trigeminal sensory
nerves through prejunctional  xxxg1110xxx  receptors, thereby
blocking the release of vasoactive neuropeptide mediators (sp, cgrp) that could produce or exacerbate the
pain and vasodilation of migraine.55 administration
of dhe prevents sp-mediated neurogenic plasma
protein extravasation in the dura mater55 and cgrpmediated neurogenic vasodilation in the meningeal
arteries (d. williamson, personal communication).1
inhibition of these effects is due to inhibition of
trigeminal c and a delta fibers, respectively. elevated cgrp levels have consistently been found in
human jugular blood during a migraine attack, and 5ht1 agonists such as dhe and sumatriptan abort the
headache and reduce cgrp to control levels.56
inhibition of transmission in the trigeminal pathway.—in cats, dhe has been shown to distribute
into the nuclei in the brain stem and spinal cord that
are closely involved with pain transmission and modulation.57 dihydroergotamine blocks electrical and
metabolic activation of second-order trigeminal sensory relay neurons resulting from trigeminal nerve
stimulation.58 the  xxxd2022xxx  action of ergot alkaloids, including e and dhe, may also involve effects
on other receptors and nuclei within the central nervous system, since the headache recurrence rates appear to be lower with these older agents compared to
the newer 5-ht1b/1d receptor selective  xxxd3263xxx  drugs.
the receptor basis for this effect is not known, but could
involve inhibitory actions in brain stem monoaminergic
nuclei that are thought to be activated during a migraine
attack and may be involved in the pathophysiology of
the disease as central migraine “generator” regions.

headache
medical subject heading (mesh) term “headache”
(exploded) and a previously published strategy for
identifying randomized controlled trials in the january
1966 to december 1996 medline database.59
other computerized bibliographic databases, textbooks, and experts were also utilized. selection criteria
included all english-language controlled trials involving patients with acute migraine headache in which at
least one treatment offered was a drug treatment.
the complete, detailed methods used in conducting this review, undertaken by duke university and
the american academy of neurology under contract
to the agency for healthcare research and quality
(formerly agency for healthcare policy and research), have been published elsewhere.60,61 the analysis of trials of ergot alkaloids is a subset of these reports. we also include recent material not in the
agency for healthcare policy and research report.
data extraction.—data were abstracted onto
specially designed forms by specially trained research
assistants and overread by experienced clinicians
with statistical expertise. published outcome data was
recorded based on the number of patients obtaining
 xxxd234xxx  according to an a priori definition of
at least a 50% reduction in pain severity. results
were recorded and used to calculate an odds ratio for
 xxxd234xxx . measures of pain severity reported
as group means (and standard deviations) were used to
calculate standardized mean differences (or effect
sizes). where similar trials provided data, meta-analysis
of efficacy measures was performed. the identity and
rates of adverse events were recorded and statistically compared.
data synthesis.—the literature search identified 24 publications reporting on 25 controlled trials
of ergot alkaloids for the acute treatment of migraine.17,62-84 one publication reported the results of 3
separate trials (referred to in this report as study 1,
study 2, and study 3).17 three publications were excluded from the efficacy and adverse events analyses.
waters was an abstract of the study more fully described in waters.82,83 gerber et al and sheftell et al
were abstracts that described ongoing trials,65,79 but
did not report any results. thus, our analysis included
21 publications reporting on 23 separate controlled
trials.

155
the 23 trials analyzed here included numerous
different treatment comparisons involving e, e-containing compounds, or ergostine-containing compounds.
comparisons with placebo included 5 trials of et, 3
trials of e plus caffeine, and single trials of e plus caffeine plus  xxxd1774xxx  (migwell), e plus caffeine plus
pentobarbital plus bellafoline (cafergot pb), e plus
caffeine plus  xxxd392xxx  plus belladonna alkaloids
(cafergot compound), and ergostine plus caffeine.
comparisons among the various ergot agents (e,
e-containing compounds, or ergostine-containing
compounds) were as follows: e plus metoclopramide
versus e ( placebo) (2 trials, 3 comparisons); e plus
metoclopramide (one dose versus another) (1 trial);
e plus caffeine versus ergostine plus caffeine (1 trial);
e plus caffeine plus  xxxd1774xxx  versus e plus caffeine
plus belladonna alkaloids plus  xxxd2898xxx  (1
trial); e plus caffeine plus pentobarbital plus bellafoline versus e plus caffeine (1 trial); e plus caffeine
plus compliance training versus e plus caffeine (1
trial), and et versus dhe nasal spray. ergotamine
or e combinations were compared with nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids [aspirin,  xxxd2423xxx , naproxen sodium, and pirprofen and tolfenamic
acid]), opiate analgesics (doleron [dextropropoxyphene
compound], doleron novum, migraleve [acetaminophen plus codeine phosphate plus  xxxd378xxx 
plus dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate]), midrin,
sumatriptan, metoclopramide, and relaxation plus
biofeedback (tables 3 and 4).
efficacy of  xxxd2022xxx .—five trials, all
of crossover design, compared et with placebo.17,62,69,73,83
four used an orally administered dose of e;62,69,73,83 one
used e in a rectal suppository form.73 doses ranged
from 1 mg to 5 mg.17,69 the outcomes analyzed, time
points used, and number of headaches treated varied
considerably from trial to trial
placebo-controlled trials of et range from finding no effect to finding large differences favoring
e.17,69,73,83 only 3 studies provided sufficient information to calculate a quantitative estimate of the efficacy of et compared to placebo; 1 of these suggested
clinically important benefits from et. the striking
results reported by ostfeld might be explained by the
large dose of e,17 a dose that is rarely used because of
the dose-related adverse effects (no data were re-

156
ported on adverse events in the trial). the 3 trials differed in the dose of et used, the route of administration, and the definition of migraine used for inclusion;
therefore, meta-analysis of these estimates was not
attempted.
efficacy of ergotamine-containing compounds.—
three trials compared the combination of et plus
caffeine with placebo.63,77,78 one used the proprietary
preparation. the three cafergot trials provided very
meager data on pain outcomes and nothing that could
be used to calculate an odds ratio or effect size.63  xxxd2022xxx  plus caffeine combinations failed to
demonstrate significant differences in  xxxd234xxx  compared with placebo. two additional etcontaining proprietary combinations (cafergot compound and cafergot pb) were found to be superior to
placebo and, in the case of cafergot pb, superior to
et plus caffeine alone. however, another combination of et plus caffeine plus  xxxd1774xxx  (migwell) was
not found to be any better than placebo in treating
nausea.
comparisons among ergotamine preparations.—
one study found cafergot pb superior to cafergot in
relieving migraine head pain severity.63 ergotamine
plus metoclopramide was found to improve headache
duration in one study and to reduce nausea in another when compared to et alone.66,80 otherwise, no
significant differences were shown among et, cafergot, cafergot compound, and ergostine.
comparisons with other acute migraine drugs.—
three trials using similar protocols and drug dosages
compared et with aspirin.67-69 two of 3 comparisons
of et with aspirin alone found et significantly better
in terms of  xxxd234xxx . however, et was not significantly different from 2 aspirin-containing compound drugs (doleron and doleron novum), 3
nsaids ( xxxd2423xxx , naproxen, tolfenamic acid),
metoclopramide, or an  xxxd2395xxx  combination
(midrin/ xxxd2395xxx ). however, only 1 of these mostly
small negative trials ruled out the possibility of a clinically significant benefit to et in comparison to the
alternative drug.73
ergotamine plus caffeine was not significantly
different from dhe nasal spray or naproxen, but it did
prove inferior to oral sumatriptan and an  xxxd2395xxx  combination (midrin) in reducing headache se-

february 2003
verity. cafergot compound was not significantly different from pirprofen in complete  xxxd234xxx  at
30 minutes. the et plus caffeine plus  xxxd1774xxx  combination (migwell or migril) was shown to be worse
than naproxen sodium but not significantly different
from migraleve at reducing headache severity.
not included on the agency for healthcare policy and research report is the combination of et
plus metoclopramide appeared to reduce headache
duration compared with metoclopramide alone. the
combination of calcium carbasalate (equivalent to
900 mg aspirin) plus metoclopramide (10 mg) was superior to a rather small dose of 1 mg e plus 100 mg
caffeine and  xxxd1976xxx  40 mg and 80 mg,85 which was
superior to  xxxd2037xxx  mg plus caffeine.86 in a recent randomized, crossover, double-blind trial including 251
patients, published so far only on the internet,87 e
plus caffeine suppositories (2 mg plus 100 mg) were
superior to 25-mg sumatriptan suppositories, with response rates of 73% and 63% after 2 hours, respectively. headache recurrence occurred more frequently
in sumatriptan- (22%) than in e- (11%) treated patients. however, slightly but not significantly more patients preferred sumatriptan suppositories (44%) to e
suppositories (36%) because of the side effect profile.
adverse effects of  xxxd2022xxx  and combinations.—short-term adverse effects associated with
e were consistently demonstrated among the trials
reporting adverse events. nausea and vomiting were
the most commonly observed adverse events. ergotamine and e-containing combinations consistently
demonstrated a higher incidence of adverse events
than placebo or comparator drugs, including sumatriptan,  xxxd2395xxx  combination, nsaids, and dextropropoxyphene compounds. the combination of e
plus metoclopramide did appear to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting compared with e
alone.

intranasal dihydroergotamine
the literature review identified 13 publications
describing 12 separate controlled trials. nine trials included comparisons of dhe nasal spray with placebo
for the acute treatment of migraine. three of these
trials tested 2 different doses of dhe against placebo.88-90 one trial compared dhe nasal spray with

headache
the proprietary formulation,70 cafergot (e 1 mg plus
caffeine 100 mg), and one compared dhe with sc
sumatriptan.91 in general, however, doses and treatment protocols used in the 9 placebo-controlled trials
were generally similar, so that results should be comparable across trials.
four of the above comparisons with placebo
provided effect size estimates suitable for metaanalysis.90,92-94 we chose the effect size for the higher
dose of dhe (1 to 4 mg) in the paiva et al study,90 because that dose was closer to the doses used in the
other trials. the effect size estimates from the 4 trials
were not heterogeneous ( 2  0.257, 3 df, p  .46),
and the estimate obtained by combining them was
0.34 (0.10 to 0.57), indicating a statistically significant
effect in favor of dhe. the summary effect size is
comparable in magnitude with the results reported in
the dhe nasal spray multicenter investigators trial,92
which found a difference of 0.4 points (on a 5-point
scale) in mean 2-hour  xxxd234xxx  scores between
dhe and placebo.
dichotomous  xxxd234xxx  data were consistent with these results in 2 trials, 1 positive and 1 just
missing statistical significance.88,95 four additional trials reported p values only, but did not permit calculation of efficacy parameters.
three comparisons of different doses of dhe
were inconclusive.—in the only two studies comparing dhe nasal spray with other active treatments, no
significant difference was observed between dhe
and cafergot for  xxxd234xxx , and sc sumatriptan
was found to be significantly better than dhe at providing  xxxd234xxx  and complete relief at 2 hours.
short-term prevention.—a single trial examined the question of whether a 2-mg dose of intranasal
dhe,95 administered during the migraine prodrome,
would effectively prevent an attack. ninety-one patients completed the crossover and were included in
the efficacy analysis. thirty-six percent (33 patients)
had no migraine attack following treatment with
dhe, compared with 26% (24 patients) with no attack following treatment with placebo. the investigators’ analysis found this difference to be significant
(p.05). we were not able to calculate an odds ratio
or effect size for this outcome on the basis of the data
reported in the study.

159
adverse events.—adverse events reported in
association with dhe were generally mild to moderate and were clearly related to the in route of administration. only 3 of the included placebo-controlled trials reported data that permitted comparison of the
overall proportion of patients reporting adverse events
with dhe nasal spray and with placebo.89,93,94 krause
and bleicher89 reported data only on those adverse
events that were considered by the investigators to be
drug related. of 14 patients using a total dhe dose
of 1 to 2 mg (2 to 4 sprays), only 1 (7%) reported any
drug-related reactions, compared with 5 of 15 patients (33%) using a lower dose of dhe (0.5 to 1 mg,
2 to 4 sprays), and no patients using placebo. the difference between the lower dose of dhe (0.5 to 1 mg)
and placebo was statistically significant, but the differences between the higher dose of dhe and placebo and between the 2 dhe doses, were not. the
remaining 2 trials found similar differences in the
overall proportion of patients using dhe and placebo who reported adverse events (20% versus 7%
and 29% versus 11%, respectively),93,94 though the
difference was statistically significant only for ziegler
et al.94
two trials included treatment arms in which patients used a dose of dhe higher than 2 mg. in gallagher’s study,96 the incidence of the most commonly
reported adverse events was slightly higher with a
3-mg dose of dhe than with a 2-mg dose. the only
trial that permitted patients to administer up to 4 mg
of dhe did not report any detailed information
about adverse events.90 the rate of adverse events
was similar to that observed with cafergot in 1 comparative study and significantly lower than that observed with sc sumatriptan in another. in the single
crossover trial comparing dhe with cafergot,70 37
adverse events were reported with dhe and 52 with
cafergot. nausea and vomiting were considered adverse events in this trial. ten patients reported 1 or
both of these symptoms while using dhe, compared
with 19 on cafergot. one patient withdrew from the
trial due to severe vomiting 15 minutes after dhe
administration; 1 withdrew due to severe nausea and
vomiting 2 hours after taking cafergot.
the only trial comparing dhe nasal spray with
sc sumatriptan reported that a significantly smaller

160
percentage of patients reported adverse events with
dhe than with sumatriptan (22% vs 43%).91
in general, the adverse events reported in association with dhe use were described by investigators
as mild or moderate in nature. by far the most common events reported were nasal congestion or irritation, throat irritation, unpleasant taste, and other local reactions related to the route of administration.

intravenous and intramuscular
dihydroergotamine
the literature review identified 8 publications reporting on 8 separate controlled trials of parenteral
dhe. six of the 8 trials used an iv formulation of
dhe,19,97-100 one used dhe in sc form,101 and one
used an im formulation of the drug.102 the trial involving intramuscular dhe was excluded from our analysis because it did not report any pain outcomes.102
two of the 7 included trials permitted comparison of dhe with placebo,19,99 3 compared dhe with
opiate analgesics,97,100,103 and 1 trial each compared
dhe with chlorpromazine (iv),98 sumatriptan,101
lidocaine (iv),98 and dexamethasone (iv).99 two
small placebo-controlled trials described in this report do not clearly establish whether intravenous
dhe is effective or ineffective for the treatment of
acute migraine. one found that dhe plus metoclopramide was significantly better than placebo at returning patients to normal functioning within 30 minutes, but our analysis did not confirm this result. the
other found no significant difference between dhe
and placebo for headache severity at 60 minutes, but
used a relatively low dose of dhe (0.75 mg) and did
not control for between-group differences in pretreatment headache severity.
perhaps the strongest evidence supporting dhe
is the single large trial comparing subcutaneous dhe
with sumatriptan, a treatment whose efficacy is firmly
supported by multiple, large, randomized, controlled
trials. though this trial showed that sumatriptan was
significantly better than dhe at providing headache
relief at 1 hour (78% of patients versus 57%) and 2
hours (85% versus 73%),101 it found that there was no
significant difference between the 2 treatments at
later time points (3, 4, and 24 hours). the trial also

february 2003
demonstrated that sumatriptan was associated with a
significantly higher headache recurrence rate (45%
of patients versus 18%). thus, although dhe appears to provide relief from head pain less quickly
than sumatriptan, it may lead to superior outcomes
over a 24-hour period for a large proportion of patients.
two of three small trials comparing intravenous
dhe with im meperidine suggest that dhe was significantly better at relieving head pain at 30 and 60
minutes.97,103 the third trial found no significant difference between the 2 treatments,100 but used a low
dose of dhe (0.5 mg versus 1 mg). individual small
trials of intravenous dhe versus butorphanol (im),
chlorpromazine (iv), lidocaine (iv), and dexamethasone (iv) provided very limited information.

conclusions
place of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine in
migraine management.—the quality standards subcommittee (qss) of the american academy of neurology (aan) developed a practice parameter which
summarized the results from the 4 evidence-based reviews on the management of patients with migraine:
specifically, acute, preventive, and nonpharmacologic
treatments for migraine, and the role of neuroimaging in patients with headache.104-109
diagnosis and treatment of migraine.—the 1988
international headache society classification of headache is the basis for headache classification in the international classification of diseases (icd-10b).110
migraine is a chronic condition with recurrent episodic attacks. its characteristics vary among patients
and often among attacks in a single patient. migraine
varies in frequency, duration, and disability among
sufferers and between attacks. it is appropriate to
link the intensity of care with the level of disability
and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting (stratified care) for the acute treatment of symptoms of an
ongoing attack. it is not appropriate to continue ineffective or poorly tolerated medication in a sequential
and arbitrary manner (step care). treatment choice
depends on the frequency and severity of attacks, the
presence and degree of temporary disability, and associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
consider the patient’s response to, and tolerance for,

headache
specific medications. consider comorbidity/coexisting
conditions. coexisting conditions (such as heart disease, pregnancy, and uncontrolled hypertension)
need to be ascertained as they may limit treatment
choices.
goals of acute migraine treatment.—(1) treat
attacks rapidly and consistently without recurrence;
(2) restore the patient’s ability to function; (3) minimize the use of backup and rescue medications (a rescue medication is used at home when other treatments fail and permits the patient to achieve relief
without the discomfort and expense of a visit to the
physician’s office or emergency department); (4) optimize self-care and reduce subsequent use of resources; (5) be cost-effective for overall management;
and (6) have minimal or no adverse events.
to meet these goals: use migraine-specific agents
(triptans, dhe, e) in patients with moderate or severe migraine or whose mild-to-moderate headaches
respond poorly to nsaids or combinations such as
aspirin plus acetaminophen plus caffeine. failure to
use an effective treatment promptly may increase
pain, disability, and the impact of the headache. select a nonoral route of administration for patients
with migraine associated with severe nausea or vomiting. antiemetics should not be restricted to patients
who are vomiting or likely to vomit. nausea itself is
one of the most aversive and disabling symptoms of a
migraine attack and should be treated appropriately.
consider a self-administered rescue medication for
patients with severe migraines that do not respond to
(or fail) other treatments. guard against medicationoveruse headache (“rebound headache” or “druginduced headache”). frequent use of acute medications (e [not dhe], opiates, triptans, simple analgesics,
and mixed analgesics containing  xxxd392xxx , caffeine, or
 xxxd2395xxx ) is generally thought to cause medication-overuse headache. many experts limit acute
therapy to 2 headache days per week on a regular basis. patients with medication overuse should use preventive therapy.
ergot alkaloids and derivatives.— ergotamine
(orally/rectally, and caffeine combination) may be
considered in the treatment of selected patients with
moderate-to-severe migraine. many small clinical trials
provide evidence about the effectiveness of e and e

161
combinations. nausea and vomiting were the most
commonly observed short-term adverse effects associated with e among the trials reporting adverse events.
the combination of e plus metoclopramide reduces
the incidence of nausea and vomiting compared with e
alone; their use should be considered for treating selected patients who have moderate-to-severe migraine. patients with very long attacks or with frequent
headache recurrence may be especially suited for e, as
headache recurrence is probably less likely with e.3
dihydroergotamine nasal spray.—dihydroergotamine nasal spray is safe and effective for the
treatment of acute migraine attacks and should be
considered for use in patients with moderate-tosevere migraine. because of their inability to tolerate
or take oral medications, patients with nausea and
vomiting may be given intranasal dhe. initial treatment with dhe nasal spray is a reasonable choice
when the headache is moderate to severe or an adequate trial of nsaids or other nonopiate analgesics
has failed to provide adequate relief in the past.
dihydroergotamine sc/iv/im and nasal spray
may be given to patients with nausea and vomiting.
dihydroergotamine sc, im, and nasal spray are reasonable initial treatment choices when the headache
is moderate to severe, or in migraine of any severity
when nonspecific medication has failed to provide
adequate relief in the past.
subcutaneous, intravenous, or intramuscular
dihydroergotamine.—intramuscular or subcutaneous
dhe may be considered in patients with moderate-tosevere migraine. parenteral antinauseants are often
used with it as adjunctive symptomatic treatments,
which complicates the assessment of the efficacy of
dhe. clinical opinion suggests that subcutaneous
dhe is relatively safe and effective when compared
with other migraine therapies, and subcutaneous
dhe has fewer adverse events than when delivered
iv. because of their inability to tolerate or take oral
medication, patients with nausea and vomiting may
be given sc, iv, or intramuscular dhe. initial treatment with subcutaneous or intramuscular dhe is a
reasonable choice when the headache is moderate to
severe or an adequate trial of nsaids or other nonopiate analgesics has failed to provide adequate relief
in the past.

162
intravenous dihydroergotamine plus intravenous
antiemetics.—intravenous dhe plus iv antiemetics
is an appropriate treatment choice for patients with
severe migraine. they have been shown to be effective and moderately safe in the treatment of moderateto-severe migraine, compared with parenteral opiates. repetitive intravenous dhe plus antiemetics
is considered an appropriate treatment choice for
patients with status migrainosus and chronic daily
headache.
 xxxd2022xxx  and dhe can also be used
parenterally for the prophylaxis of menstrual migraine and can be used for the prevention of cluster
headache.111,112
