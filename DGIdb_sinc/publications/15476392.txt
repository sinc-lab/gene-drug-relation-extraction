abstract:  xxxg1626xxx  (odc) is an obligate homodimer that catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′phosphate-dependent decarboxylation of  xxxd2793xxx  to putrescine, a vital step in polyamine biosynthesis.
a previous mutagenic analysis of the odc dimer interface identified several residues that were distant
from the active site yet had a greater impact on catalytic activity than on dimer stability [myers, d. p.,
et al. (2001) biochemistry 40, 13230-13236]. to better understand the basis of this phenomenon, the
structure of the trypanosoma brucei odc mutant k294a was determined to 2.15 å resolution in complex
with the substrate analogue d-ornithine. this residue is distant from the reactive center (>10 å from the
plp schiff base), and its mutation reduced catalytic efficiency by 3 kcal/mol. the x-ray structure
demonstrates that the mutation increases the disorder of residues leu-166-ala-172 (lys-169 loop), which
normally form interactions with lys-294 across the dimer interface. in turn, the lys-169 loop forms
interactions with the active site, suggesting that the reduced catalytic efficiency is mediated by the decreased
stability of this loop. the extent of disorder varies in the four lys-169 loops in the asymmetric unit,
suggesting that the mutation has led to an increase in the population of inactive conformations. the structure
also reveals that the mutation has affected the nature of the ligand-bound species. each of the four active
sites contains unusual ligands. the electron density suggests one active site contains a gem-diamine
intermediate with d-ornithine; the second has density consistent with a tetrahedral adduct with glycine,
and the remaining two contain tetrahedral adducts of plp, lys-69, and water (or hydroxide). these data
also suggest that the structure is less constrained in the mutant enzyme. the observation of a gem-diamine
intermediate provides insight into the conformational changes that occur during the odc catalytic cycle.

 xxxg1626xxx  (odc)1 catalyzes the decarboxylation of  xxxd2793xxx  (l-orn) to the diamine putrescine (put),
a crucial step in polyamine biosynthesis (1-4). cells that
are depleted of polyamines undergo growth arrest and do
not progress through the cell cycle. because of the importance of polyamines to cell growth, odc has been investigated as a therapeutic target for a number of proliferative
diseases. most notably, odc has proven to be an effective
target in the treatment of african sleeping sickness, a fatal
tropical disease.
odc is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme
that is a member of the fold type iii plp family, which
includes alanine racemase (5-8). these enzymes are obligate
homodimers, and the active site is formed at the dimer

interface between the n-terminal beta/r-barrel domain of one
subunit and the c-terminal, beta-barrel domain of the second
subunit (figure 1). the n-terminal domain contains an active
site lys residue (lys-69) that binds plp through a schiff
base (internal aldimine). substrate binding displaces this
interaction through a series of steps that include the formation
of (1) a noncovalent michaelis complex, (2) a tetrahedral
gem-diamine intermediate, and (3) the schiff base (external
aldimine) between l-orn and plp. once l-orn is bound as
a schiff base, the conjugated pi system of plp facilitates
decarboxylation (9). decarboxylation is followed by protonation and product release, which is rate-limiting, regenerating the internal aldimine (10). previous structural analysis
has provided evidence for the schiff base species between
plp and lys-69 [uncomplexed native enzyme (8)] and for
the schiff base species with the product putrescine and with
substrate analogues [d-orn and  xxxd1972xxx  (11, 12)].
odc buries a significant amount of surface area (2775
å2) along the dimer interface (8). ala-scanning mutagenesis
of residues in the trypanosoma brucei odc dimer interface
suggested that the energetic contribution of these residues
to dimerization was distributed across the interface such that
mutation of any single residue had little impact on dimerization (13). in contrast, the analysis demonstrated that a
number of dimer interface residues are instead important for
odc activity, and this finding extended to a subset of

with d-orn and lys-69, which has not previously been
observed. model building suggests that, due to steric
constraints upon binding, the gem-diamine with l-orn
substrate will be analogous to the diamine with d-orn, and
thus, the structure reveals how the bond between the substrate
rnu group and the c4′ atom of plp starts perpendicular to
the plane of the plp before rotating to form a planar system
with plp. comparisons with the structure of native odc
with an internal aldimine (8) and odc in complex with the
product put (odc/put) (11) reveal further conformational
changes that take place during the catalytic cycle.

residues that were distant from the active site. thus, the dimer
interface of odc is optimized to promote catalysis and not
to maximize the protein-protein interaction.
one of the largest effects on catalytic activity caused by
the mutation of a distant site, dimer interface residue occurred
at lys-294, located more than 10 å from the active site
cofactor and ligands (13). lys-294 is located within the
beta-sheet domain where it forms hydrogen bond and salt bridge
interactions across the dimer interface with residues from
the beta/r-barrel domain of the opposite monomer (figure 1).
approximately 90 å2 of solvent-accessible surface area from
this residue is buried upon odc dimerization (13). interestingly, while this residue is conserved in the most closely
related homologues to t. brucei odc (e.g., mammalian and
frog), it is not an invariant residue, suggesting that its function
is linked to sequence context.
to understand the structural basis for the mutational effects
on odc activity from this long-range interaction, we have
determined the x-ray structure of k294a odc bound to
the substrate analogue d-ornithine (d-orn) to 2.15 å resolution. the loop from leu-166 to ala-172 (lys-169 loop),
which forms hydrogen bonding interactions with lys-294
in wild-type odc, is destabilized and becomes more
disordered. this primary feature apparently renders the active
site more permissive, as up to three different complexes are
observed at the four different active sites in these crystals.
the most interesting is the tetrahedral gem-diamine of plp

odc expression and purification. the creation of the
k294a t. brucei odc mutant was described previously (13).
the mutant protein was purified as described for wild-type
odc (8, 11, 14). for crystallization, the his tag was removed
by tev protease digestion as described previously (15).
steady-state assays of odc activity. the steady-state rates
were measured over a range of enzyme and substrate
concentrations at 37 °c, in the presence of excess free plp
(0.2 mm) using a previously described (14) enzyme-linked
spectrophotometric assay that is based on the co2 detection
kit (sigma diagnostics, st. louis, mo). enzyme and
substrate levels were as follows: for k294a odc, [e] )
50-400 nm and [s] ) 3-87.5 mm, and for wild-type odc,
[e] 10-40 nm and [l-orn] ) 0.2-6 mm. to determine an
apparent binding affinity for plp, the concentration of free
plp (0-0.16 mm) was varied at a fixed l-orn concentration
(50 mm) and the activity of the mutant (200 nm) or wildtype odc (50 nm) measured. the concentration dependencies of the decarboxylation rates were fitted to eq 1

hepes (ph 7.5), 100 mm nacl, 0.5 mm 2- xxxd26xxx ,
and 0.02 mm plp at 20 °c (13)] differ from those in the

data collection and processing. diffraction data were
collected at beamline 19-id (sbc-cat) at the advanced
photon source (argonne national laboratory, argonne, il).
data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the hkl2000
program package (16). data processing statistics are summarized in table 1.
structure determination and refinement. the coordinates
of a dimer from the t. brucei k69a odc structure
complexed with  xxxd1972xxx  (8) (pdb entry 2tod), with  xxxd1972xxx ,
waters, and the side chains for lys-294 and cys-360
removed, were used as a search model to calculate initial
phases by molecular replacement using amore (17). the
model for k294a odc was built in o version 6.2.2 (18)
and refined utilizing data collected between 35 and 2.15 å
until an rfree of 32 was reached using cns (19). additional
rounds of refinement were conducted using refmac 5 (ccp4)
(20, 21) to take advantage of the use of tls parameters (22).
an identical set of test flags was maintained in reflection
files between cns and ccp4 programs. water molecules
were added using both cns and refmac5 and edited in o.
medium noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were kept
for initial rounds of refinement, and released for several
rounds, and then restraints were added again for the
remainder of the refinement. procheck (23) confirmed
that no peptide torsion angles in our k294a odc model
were found in disallowed regions of a ramachandran plot,
while 1086 of 1198 non-glycine and non-proline residues
fall within the most favored regions. final refinement
statistics were calculated in cns and are listed in table 1.
determination of the overall root-mean-square deviation. coordinates from the structures of k294a odc, odc
complexed with putrescine (odc/put) (pdb entry 1f3t) (11),
or k69a odc complexed with  xxxd1972xxx  (k69a odc/ xxxd1972xxx )
(8) (pdb entry 2tod) were edited to include only shared
amino acid residues 37-157, 171-296, 312-340, and 350408, and then they were superimposed as either monomers
or dimers in insightii (accelrys). the rms deviation for each
residue was obtained in cns. the main chain rmsd was
calculated by averaging over all residues.

odc (200 nm) or (b) wild-type odc (50 nm) over a range of
plp concentrations. plots were created using sigmaplot 2001 (spss
inc.). data are shown as filled circles. the k294a odc data have
been fit to eq 1, and the fit is rendered as a solid line.

collection of uv-vis spectra for wild-type and k294a
odc with and without putrescine or d-orn. uv-vis spectra
(250-500 nm) for wild-type (60 µm) and k294a odc (200
µm) were collected in hepes (150 mm, ph 8) at room
temperature with or without putrescine or d-orn (50 mm,
ph 8). enzyme was first desalted into fresh buffer to
eliminate any excess free plp. after spectral scans had been
taken, k294a odc (with or without putrescine) was
centrifuged using a centricon ym-10 ultrafiltration device
(mw cutoff of 10 000) (millipore corp., bedford, ma), and
the flow through (less than half of the starting volume) was
analyzed spectrally to assess plp dissociation. less than 2%
of the plp dissociated from unliganded k294a odc and
less than 20% in the presence of putrescine.
results
steady-state analysis of k294a odc activity. the effect
of free plp on odc activity was determined under steadystate conditions using 50 mm l-orn and either k294a odc
(200 nm) or wild-type odc (50 nm). while nearly maximal
activity is observed for wild-type odc in the absence of
free plp, a clear titration of k294a odc activity is observed
as the concentration of free plp is increased (figure 2). a
fit of these data yielded an apparent km for plp of 36 µm
for k294a odc, a 240-fold increase over the km for plp
in the wild-type enzyme (previously reported to be 0.15 µm)
(24). the value for k294a odc is similar to that observed
for r277a mutant odc; this residue forms a salt bridge

with the phosphate moiety of plp (24). these data suggest
that the affinity for plp has been altered in this mutant.
the steady-state kinetic parameters kcat and km (for l-orn)
were determined for both wild-type (20-40 nm) and k294a
odc (150-300 nm) in the presence of 200 µm free plp,
which is saturating for both enzymes (table 2). the kcat
measured for k294a odc (3.5 s-1) is 4-fold lower and the
value for km (43 mm) 114-fold higher than the corresponding
parameters for wild-type odc. values of kcat and km for
k294a and wild-type odc have been reported previously
but under conditions where free plp was limiting [50 µm
(13)].
at lower enzyme concentrations (50-150 nm), the kcat
for k294a odc had a small but reproducible dependence
on enzyme concentration (data not shown), suggesting that
the dimer may not be fully stable under the assay conditions.
however, the effect was not sufficiently significant to utilize
the kinetic analysis to derive a kd for dimerization. steadystate kinetic data were thus collected at enzyme concentrations above 150 nm to ensure full dimer formation under
assay conditions. for the wild-type enzyme, no enzyme
concentration dependence on kcat is observed above 20 nm.
previous analysis of dimer formation for k294a odc by
analytical ultracentrifugation suggested that the kd for dimer
formation was not significantly affected (13). differences
in salt and temperature conditions may account for the
observed disparity in dimerization between these two experimental methods.
crystallization, data collection, and structure determination. the molecular structure of t. brucei k294a odc
was determined using space group p212121 (a ) 67.5 å, b
) 152.4 å, and c ) 155.0 å) to 2.15 å resolution. the
final model contains four monomers in the asymmetric unit
(which are labeled a-d), in the form of two homodimers,
containing a total of 1414 amino acid residues, four plp
molecules, and 260 water molecules. chains a and b form
the first dimer in the asymmetric unit, and chains c and d
compose the second. the r-factor is 24.4% with an rfree of
27.9% for data between 35 and 2.15 å (table 1). these
r-factors are similar to those observed for previous t. brucei
odc structures, and the relatively high rfree is probably due
to the high percentage of disorder (20%) and unmodeled
differences between the subunits, especially in these disordered regions. the refinement yielded interpretable density
(minimally) for amino acid residues 37-157, 169-296, and
312-408 for all monomers, with the exceptions that density
for residues 345-348 of monomer b could not be interpreted. additionally, while weak density for residues 169
and 170 for monomer a was observed, positions and
orientations for these residues could not be determined
unambiguously, so they were omitted from the final coordinates. monomer d had additional definable density at the

biochemistry, vol. 43, no. 41, 2004 12993
n-terminus, for residues 14-30, and monomer b had
additional density for residues 409-420 at the c-terminus.
different adducts occupy the four active sites. the
electron density in the active sites of the k294a odc
structure suggests that they are differentially occupied with
d-orn, glycine, or water. the active site at the interface
between the beta/r-barrel of monomer b and the beta-sheet
domain of monomer a (defined as active site b) contains
density that unambiguously can be assigned to a complex
with a d-orn molecule, bound in a gem-diamine to plp,
with lys-69. this active site will be discussed in greater
detail below and will be the active site region used in
structural comparisons throughout this paper. within the
same dimer, active site a shows density that is consistent
with a molecule of glycine (used as an additive in the crystal
conditions), bound in a tetrahedral adduct with lys-69 and
plp (gem-diamine). strong density is observed for the rn,
cr, and coo moieties of gly, while no density is observed
that would indicate the presence of a side chain in this active
site. attempts made to refine the structure with a d-orn in
the a active site resulted in the appearance of negative
density in a 2fo - fc map. thus, the ligand was modeled as
a gly. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that this
active site contains d-orn, and that density for the side chain
is missing due to partial disorder or multiple occupancy.
active sites in the second dimer, c and d possess no large
adducts to plp. however, positive density in the fo - fc
map observed at the c4′ position of plp, opposite from lys69 (data not shown), suggests that plp exists as a carbinolamine (the tetrahedral adduct that includes lys-69 and
hydroxide). plp-tetrahedral carbinolamine has been observed
spectrally in solution at high ph (25).
d-orn gem-diamine, active site b. in active site b, d-orn
is bound as a tetrahedral adduct among lys-69, plp, and
d-orn (figures 3 and 4). the d-orn is near the surface of
odc on the opposite side of the plp with respect to lys69. significant conformational differences are present between the gem-diamine and the external aldimine. in the
gem-diamine structure, the rn group of d-orn forms a
h-bond with the side chain of his-197 (3.3 å from n2 of
his-197). in the external aldimine (such as with odc/put),
the rn atom of the substrate is in the plane of the plp,
forming interactions with the phenolic oxygen of plp, which
positions it away from his-197 (figures 4 and 5) (11). in
the external aldimine structure, the positioning of these
groups leads to the formation of a conjugated pi system more
planar than that observed for the gem-diamine.
there are other conformational differences local to the
gem-diamine as well. cys-360, which has been observed in
two different conformations in various odc structures, is
observed in multiple conformations in this structure. in the
active site that contains d-orn (b) and in active site c, it is
positioned in the “down” conformation pointing away from
d-orn. this is the conformation observed previously in native
odc (8) and in an inhibited odc complex with d-orn
(odc/d-orn/ xxxg418xxx ) (12). in active sites a and d, cys-360
is in the “up” conformation pointing toward the plp, which
is the position previously observed for the product complex
structures (8, 11). density for cys-360 residues modeled in
the up orientation was weak, and it is possible that these
cys-360 residues exist in more than one orientation, and that
the observed density is an average of this partial occupancy.

ala-294 site at the dimer interface. the k294a mutation
induces increased disorder in a loop forming the subunit
interface and active site. in native odc, lys-294, which
belongs to strand c2b (figure 1), bridges the homodimer
(figure 6) by binding to two loops in the beta/r-barrel from
the opposite monomer, the lys-169 loop, and a loop
containing asp-134. the lys-169 loop is a locus of disorder
in the various t. brucei odc structures that have been
determined. n of the lys-294 side chain forms hydrogen
bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of lys-169 and the
side chain oxygens (gammao) of asp-134 from the opposite
monomer. asp-134 in turn forms hydrogen bond interactions
with phe-170, further stabilizing the lys-169 loop. the
position of these residues is mainly unaltered in the ala-

294 structure. however, the loop containing lys-169 becomes more disordered in the mutant. residues val-158arg-165 are disordered in all five t. brucei odc structures
that have been determined (table 3), but in the mutant, leu166 and ser-167 are also disordered in all four monomers.
disorder of leu-166 and ser-167 was also previously
observed in the odc/d-orn/ xxxg418xxx  structure (12). finally, the
disorder observed near active site a is more extensive than
in the other monomers; the locus of the gly adduct, val168, lys-169, and phe-170 are also in weak density,
suggesting that the mutation has relaxed the protein, allowing
it to more readily adapt multiple conformations. the absence
of the lys-294 side chain h-bond with the backbone carbonyl
of lys-169 is likely a contributing factor in this disorder.

secondary structure and carbon atoms are colored orange or yellow. plp and d-orn carbon atoms are colored black. plp and ligand are

black and white coil denote disordered regions and are drawn to connect ordered residues of odc/put.

the disorder in the lys-169 loop is likely to explain the
structural basis for the reduced catalytic activity of the mutant
enzyme. residues that become disordered in the loop either
are involved directly in the active site or form interactions
with important catalytic residues. first, on the basis of its
position in the odc/put structure, leu-166 is within 4.5 å
of the carboxylate of d-orn in the k294a odc gem-diamine
structure. modeling suggests that it will also be near the
carboxylate of l-orn in the gem-diamine, but not the schiff
base structure, and thus, it could potentially be involved in
direct interactions with the substrate during the catalytic
cycle. second, other residues in the loop have second-shell
interactions with the active site. lys-169 forms hydrogen
bonding interactions across the dimer interface with four

residues [gly-357 (3 å), thr-359 (2.5 å), asp-361 (3.2 å),
and asp-364 (3.3 å)] in the “catalytic loop”, and phe-170
(3.3 å) is within van der waals distance of the carbonyl of
cys-360 (figure 6). asp-361 interacts directly with ligand
(figures 4 and 5), and is essential for substrate binding, while
evidence suggests that cys-360 is a catalytic base (11, 26).
interestingly, the effects of mutation of either lys-169 or
phe-170 to ala on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme
are similar to that for the k294a mutant [kcat/km is reduced
by 3-4 kcal/mol (13)].
structural comparison between k294a and wild-type
odc and other odc complexes. outside of the increased
disorder of the lys-169-loop, conformational differences
between k294a odc and wild-type odc are small and

a amino acid residues from two internal regions that are found to
be disordered in t. brucei odc structures are listed for each chain.
k294a odc refers to the structure reported in this paper, odc/put
the structure of wild-type odc in complex with odc’s reaction product
putrescine (11), and odc/d-orn/ xxxg418xxx  the structure of wild-type odc
in complex with d-orn and  xxxg418xxx  (12). native odc is the wild-type,
unliganded odc (8), and k69a odc/ xxxd1972xxx  refers to the structure of
a k69a mutant odc that has been irreversibly inactivated with
 xxxd2430xxx  ( xxxd1972xxx ) (8).

distributed throughout the protein. the rmsds were below
0.25 å for superposition of individual domains, below 0.3
for superposition of monomers (k294a vs wild-type odc/
put), and below 0.43 å for superposition of dimers. the
differences in these numbers are due to slight domain and
subunit rotations. similar results were obtained when k294a
odc was superimposed with k69a odc/ xxxd1972xxx . to
determine where the largest conformational changes occurred
relative to the mutation, we analyzed the conformational
change within a single subunit by superimposing the cterminal domains of k294a odc with the wild-type native
odc structure (pdb entry 1qu4, superimposed). in this
alignment, the n-terminal domains show the greatest rmsd,
a reflection of a slight domain rotation between the structures
(figure 7). some discrete sites also show greater variation.
these spikes largely occur at sites of conformational changes
observed previously in odc and in surface loops. conformational differences were observed at similar loci between
odc/put and native odc (empty), with a correlation
coefficient of 0.3 for changes within individual domains
(correlation coefficient calculated as the average value of
the cosine of the angle between the shift vectors for cr atoms
of k294a odc - native odc vs odc/put - native odc).
comparison of uv-vis spectra for k294a and wild-type
odc with or without the product. the spectral properties
of the plp cofactor provide insight into the electronic and
tautomeric states of the cofactor (27). to assess the state of
ligation of k294a in solution, uv-vis spectra were
measured for product (put) complexes of k294a and wildtype odc (figure 8). both the native and putrescinecomplexed, wild-type enzyme exhibit comparable spectra,
with 340 nm absorption maxima and a significant 420 nm
peak due to the internal and external aldimine. unliganded
k294a odc has similar spectra. the spectrum of putrescinebound k294a is very different, with a larger maximum at
415 nm and almost no peak at 335 nm. similar spectra were
obtained with and without d-orn (data not shown). subtracting the flow-through spectra after ultrafilitration from the

k294a odc spectra does not significantly affect the size
of the observed change, indicating that the dramatic shift in
the maximum is not due to plp dissociation. these results
provide additional evidence that the k294a mutation alters
the liganded active site structure. however, the spectrum with
a large maximum at 420 nm is still characteristic of an sp2
hybridized (c4′) schiff base species. in contrast, a gem-

diamine exhibits sp3 hybridization about c4′, and a sp3hybridized species typically has a strong spectral maximum
around 340 nm (27); thus, the data suggest that the gemdiamine observed in the x-ray structure of the mutant is not
well-populated in solution.

observation of the gem-diamine intermediate of d-orn on
k294a odc is the first structural evidence of a reaction
intermediate that forms along the pathway between the
internal and external aldimine species. comparison of the
orientation of d-orn in the k294a structure with that of put
in the odc/put structure demonstrates that a significant
rotation must occur for the ligand to reposition from the gemdiamine to the catalytically competent schiff base structure
(figures 4 and 5). the c4′ (plp)-rn (d-orn) bond of the
gem-diamine in the k294a odc structure is perpendicular
to the plane of the plp ring, whereas the c4′ (plp)-rn
(put) bond of the external aldimine in the odc/put structure
is parallel to the plp ring. a rotation of nearly 90° about
the c4-c4′ bond of plp is required to build the extended
conjugated system thought to facilitate decarboxylation (9).
the position of d-orn in the gem-diamine places rn of
d-orn within 3 å of a his-197 side chain n2. this hydrogen
bond is broken as the schiff base forms, and it is replaced
by the hydrogen bond to the c3 hydroxyl of plp. the
proximity of rn of his-197 in the gem-diamine structure
suggests that his-197 may be the general acid that abstracts
a proton from the gem-diamine intermediate, prior to
formation of the external aldimine.
the observed position of d-orn is very likely to be the
initial binding site for the natural substrate l-orn. model
building suggests that l-orn would initially bind similarly
(relative to plp) to d-orn with the c4′ (plp)-rn (orn)
bond perpendicular to the plp ring. this binding mode
would place both the l- and d-orn carboxylates on the
solvent-exposed side of the odc active site (away from lys69), although with different orientations with respect to plp.
as the c4′-rn bond rotates to form the interaction between
rn and the plp phenolic oxygen moiety, the carboxylate
of l-orn is predicted to swing into the back of the active
site pocket toward lys-69 and phe-297. previous mutagenic
data demonstrated that phe-297 is essential for decarboxylation, supporting this orientation for the schiff base with
l-orn (36). the repositioned carboxylate of d-orn remains
on the solvent-exposed active site face and, as observed in
the odc/d-orn/ xxxg418xxx  structure (12). in addition, d-orn does
not come into full alignment with the conjugated plp system
of plp, explaining its poor reactivity as a substrate.
how the mutation of lys-294 affects the conformational
stability of the active site is less clear. the structure of
k294a odc is not different at the site of mutation. instead,
an order-disorder transition occurs in the lys-169 loop, to
which k294 is bound in wild-type odc, and the extent of
this disorder varies for the four monomers in the asymmetric
unit. the lys-169 loop contains leu-166 which, while
disordered in the mutant structure, is positioned within 4.5
å of d-orn on the basis of its location in the putrescinebound structure. on the basis of modeling, this residue is
also predicted to form interactions with the carboxylate of
l-orn in the gem-diamine, but not the schiff base structure.
further, lys-169 which is also disordered in one active site
in the mutant structure forms h-bond interactions with asp361, a residue involved in substrate binding (26). thus, we
conclude that the main effect of the mutation on activity is
mediated by changes in the stability of the lys-169 loop,
which are propagated to the active site loop that contains
both asp-361 and the potential catalytic base, cys-360 (11).
disorder of an active site loop was also observed as a

discussion
a number of studies have demonstrated that essential
functional residues in an enzyme are not limited to those
residues that are in direct contact with substrates or ligands
[e.g., odc (13), trypsin (28),  xxxg631xxx  (2931), and  xxxg2366xxx  (32-34)]. the structural
basis for these effects is not well understood but has been
postulated to involve conformational changes and alterations
in protein dynamics (32, 33). for many enzymes, amino acid
residues that form the protein interface between subunits not
only function to stabilize the oligomeric structure but also
may contribute to the formation of the active site. this is
the case for odc, where the active sites are formed at the
subunit interface. a number of residues in the dimer interface
of odc, including lys-294, contribute long-range interactions that promote efficient catalysis (13). mutation of lys294, in particular, increases the km for both l-orn and plp,
reducing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. additional
evidence that the mutation affects the active site environment
comes from the observation that the spectral properties of
plp in complex with substrate analogues or products are
significantly altered. characterization of the x-ray structure
of t. brucei k294a odc confirms that the active site
structure has been perturbed by this mutation and suggests
that subtle changes in the stability of key regions of the
protein may account for the catalytic effects.
the ligands observed bound to the active site in the crystal
structure of k294a odc are highly unusual. all four active
sites contain tetrahedral species at c4′ of plp, with two
containing a tetrahedral water, one apparently containing a
glycine, and the fourth containing d-orn, a stereoisomer of
the natural substrate l-orn. tetrahedral species among lys69, plp, and the ligand have not been previously observed
in the odc active site, as all previous structures (native,
d-orn/ xxxg418xxx , putrescine, or  xxxd1972xxx ) contained schiff base
species in the active site (8, 11, 12). the finding that the
tetrahedral adducts are stable in the mutant structure suggests
that the active site conformation has been altered by the
mutation. importantly, in comparison with the structure of
wild-type odc internal aldimine structure, no conformational
change occurs in the position of plp upon formation of this
adduct, suggesting the observed intermediate is a functional
species (8). the gem-diamine is normally a transient binding
intermediate that is not competent for decarboxylation; thus,
its greater stability could in part account for the reduced
catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzyme. however, on the
basis of the spectral analysis, it appears that only a fraction
of k294a odc exists as a gem-diamine species in solution,
and we have preferentially crystallized this conformer. a
gem-diamine intermediate has previously been observed in
a native structure of another plp-dependent enzyme, lhistidinol phosphate aminotransferase (35). in this case, the
gem-diamine formation was attributed to the inability of
substrate-soaked crystals to undergo productive binding.
the structure reveals several aspects of the mechanism of
action and the conformational changes that occur in odc.

12998 biochemistry, vol. 43, no. 41, 2004
possible mechanism of allosteric inhibition of odc by the
noncompetitive inhibitor  xxxg418xxx  (24). small conformational
changes also occur throughout the molecule (<0.5 å rmsd
for the main chain compared with the wild type; figure 1).
these conformational changes correlate somewhat with those
observed in comparisons of wild-type odc to ligand-bound
odcs, suggesting that they are determined by the fold and
not by the mutation.
the flexibility in the lys-169 loop in odc may be an
essential component of the catalytic cycle that is linked to
structural changes in the cys-360 loop. cys-360 has been
observed in two conformations in the available odc
structures, and it is one of the few structural changes that
have been correlated with ligand binding (8, 11, 12). it is
typically positioned away from the active site (up position)
in unliganded structures and in the inhibited complex with
d-orn (odc/d-orn/ xxxg418xxx ) (12), and toward (down position)
the active site in structures containing decarboxylated ligands,
suggesting these conformational changes are linked to the
odc catalytic cycle (12). in the k294a odc structure, the
position of cys-360 is variable depending on the subunit and
it is observed in both the up (active sties a and d) (cys
side chain oriented toward substrate and plp) and down
(active sites b and c) (oriented away) position. the structural
data for the k294a odc mutant suggest that these residues,
minimally including lys-294, lys-169, and cys-360, are part
of a network of residues organized to undertake concerted
motion during the catalytic cycle. mutation of lys-294
increases the flexibility of the adjacent lys-294 and lys169 loops, allowing more conformational states to be
populated, fewer of which are catalytically competent. in
support, an ensemble of conformations are suggested by the
finding that the disorder in the lys-169 loops varies for the
four monomers in the asymmetric unit, and by the fact that
the four active sites contain different unusual ligand structures
and different conformers of cys-360. thus, by promoting
disorder at the interface, this mutation allows the energy of
the reaction coordinate to be dissipated unproductively,
unlinking the residues in the pathway that participate in the
concerted conformational changes needed for efficient
catalysis.
residues that are energetically coupled to each other in
the function of proteins have been identified by the observation of co-evolution of amino acid changes (37, 38).
interestingly, lys-294 is not an invariant residue in odc. it
is conserved only in those sequences that branch most closely
to t. brucei odc by phylogenetic analysis (e.g., mammalian,
frog, and drosophila odcs). however, the position is likely
to play the same role in all structures, and sequence changes
at position 294 are likely to be paired with conserved changes
at other positions in the protein.
the normal function of odc (and any enzyme) is to
channel the substrate-plp complex through the correct
reaction pathway, and odc is able to bind reaction intermediates and products, thus promoting catalysis. here we
have a glimpse of how very subtle changes in the active site,
induced by mutations in a third-shell residue, amino acid
lys-294, can lead to a loss of catalytic efficiency. lys-294
may be important for stabilizing the odc active site in a
catalytically productive conformation, or it may play a role
in concerted dynamic motion required to traverse the
complex reaction pathway in an energetically favorable way.
