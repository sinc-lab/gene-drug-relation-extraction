abstract
we previously reported that  xxxg2417xxx  (vip) promoted synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (pc) in alveolar type ii (atii) cells.
but the intracellular mechanism for this effect was unknown. in this work, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathway for vip
promoted synthesis of pc, the major lipid component of pulmonary surfactant (ps), by using an antagonist of vip receptors, inhibitor of protein
kinase c (pkc) and antisense oligonucleotides (as-odn) for c-fos oncogene. our results showed that: ① [d-p-cl-phe(6)-leu(17)]-vip
(10− 6 mol/l), an antagonist of vip receptors, could decrease the quantity of [3h] choline incorporation, microsomal  xxxd2929xxx 
cytidylyltransferase (cct) mrna expression and cct activity induced by vip (10− 8 mol/l) in cultured lung explants to the control levels; ②
vip (10− 8 mol/l) upregulated c-fos protein expression in atii cells. as-odn for c-fos oncogene (9 × 10− 6 mol/l) could block the elevation of
[3h] choline incorporation, microsomal cct mrna expression and cct activity induced by vip in cultured lung explants and in atii cells; ③
h7 (10− 5 mol/l), a pkc inhibitor could also reduce vip induced [3h] choline incorporation, microsomal cct mrna expression and cct activity
in cultured lung explants and in atii cells. these results demonstrated that vip receptors, pkc and c-fos protein played important roles in the
signaling pathway through which vip promoted the synthesis of pc.

1. introduction
 xxxg2417xxx  (vip) is the capital neurotransmitter or neuromodulator of the inhibitory non-adrenergic noncholinergic nervous system in the lungs [1]. it has been discovered that vip influences many aspects of pulmonary
functions, such as dilating pulmonary vessels, relaxing airway
smooth muscle, stimulating the secretion of mucus from tracheal
submucosal glands, protecting airway epithelium against
apoptosis, suppressing proinflammatory cytokines release by
macrophages and lymphocytes and ameliorating lung injury
induced by oxidation [2]. pulmonary surfactant (ps), which is
secreted by alveolar type ii (atii) cells, is a lipoprotein complex
on the alveolar surface. the major component of ps is lipids

which make up 85%–90% of total ps weight. while phospholipids make up 80%–90% of total lipids weight, phosphatidylcholine (pc) makes up 70%–80% of phospholipids weight. ps
reduces the surface tension at the air–water interface and
stabilizes the alveoli during expiration. surfactant deficiency or
dysfunction is associated with occurrence and development of
many pulmonary diseases, such as neonate respiratory distress
syndrome (nrds), acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ards), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases
[3]. it is of great interest to know whether vip played a role in the
regulation of ps homeostasis in the lungs.
we previously reported that vip upregulated synthesis of pc,
the major phospholipids component of ps by enhancing the
activity of  xxxd2929xxx  cytidylyltransferase (cct) in atii
cells [4]. but the intracellular signal transduction pathway for this
remained elusive. tams jw et al. once reported that after binding
to its receptors, vip could regulate functional activities of target

cells through multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways,
such as camp-dependent protein kinase pathway and phospholipase c-protein kinase c (pkc) pathway [5]. in this work, we
investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathway for
enhanced synthesis of pulmonary surfactant phospholipids
mediated by vip in lung explants culture system and elucidated
the regulatory mechanism of vip on the synthesis of ps.

rats were anesthetized with ethyl carbamate (1 g/kg). the
chest was opened under sterile conditions and blood in the
lungs was rushed away with 0.9% nacl by pulmonary artery
intubation. isolated lungs were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and
washed 3 times with ice-cold dmem. twenty to thirty pieces of
lung explants were placed onto a sterile filter paper resting on a
stainless steel mesh in each well of a six-well plate, and cultured
with serum free dmem (adding 105 u/l penicillin and 100 mg/

collected after being cultured further for 2 to 16 h and washed 3
times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and then
lung explants homogenates were made on ice. the protein
quantity was determined by lowry's method. the total lipids in
the homogenates were extracted twice with chloroform:methanol (2:1, vol:vol), dried under nitrogen gas and then resuspended in 200 mul chloroform. the quantity of [3h] choline

dissolving 45 nmol odn in 100 mul dmem medium and buffer
b was made by mixing 20 mul lipofectamine with 100 mul dmem
medium. the odn–lipofactamine complex was formed by
combining buffers a and b, and standing at room temperature

(hema, china). after adjusting to the gray value of the control, the
mean values of each group were calculated. three independent
experimental results were statistically analyzed.

deep brown staining particles could be clearly seen in the nuclei
of atii cells (fig. 1). [d-p-cl-phe(6)-leu(17)]-vip

enhancing effect of vip on c-fos expression (p b 0.05) (figs. 2
and 3).
3.2.2. as-odn of c-fos oncogene blocked vip induced c-fos

the enhancing effect of vip on c-fos expression could be
abolished if lung explants were pretreated with as-odn of c-fos
oncogene (9 × 10− 6 mol/l) for 8 h (p b 0.01) (figs. 2 and 3). but
no such effect could be seen if lung explants were pretreated with
the same amount of s-odn of c-fos oncogene. adding
lipofectamine alone to the lung explants has no influence on cfos protein expression (p b 0.01) (figs. 2 and 3).

for 8 h. but this effect could not been seen if lung explants were
pretreated with the control s-odn of c-fos oncogene. adding
lipofectamine alone to the lung explants has no influence on

results demonstrated that the quantity of c-fos expression in
atii cells was significantly enhanced after pretreatment of lung

lung explants (p b 0.01) (fig. 4) and in atii cells (p b 0.05)
(figs. 5 and 6). this demonstrated that pkc was an upstream
messenger (before c-fos expression) in the intracellular signal
transduction pathway for vip promoted pc synthesis.
4. discussion
vip, released by vip positive fibers, is an extracellular signal
molecule in the lungs. the normal vip concentration in serum
is around 10− 11 mol/l [13]. vip is relatively abundant in the
lungs, as vip positive nerve fibers are widely distributed at
airway smooth muscle layer, tracheal submucosal glands and
wells of pulmonary vessels and bronchi. vip causes pulmonary
blood vessel and airway dilation in vitro with an ed50 of
approximately 10− 8 mol/l [14]. vip in blood is hydrolyzed
quickly with a half-life of only 0.4–1 min. in the present study,
the vip concentration of 10− 8 mol/l was employed.
when vip binds to its receptors on the surface of numerous
kinds of cells in the lungs, intracellular signal transduction
pathway will be induced. with the passage of this signal
transduction cascade, expression patterns of many genes will be
modulated and various physiological changes occur. vpac1
and vpac2 are two major subtypes of vip receptors both of
which have been found in the lungs [15]. in this work, we
demonstrated that the enhancing effect of vip on c-fos protein
expression, [methyl-3h]choline incorporation, lung explants
microsomal cct activity, cct mrna expression in lung
explants and atii cells could be blocked to the control levels by
[d-p-cl-phe(6)-leu(17)]-vip (10− 6 mol/l), an antagonist of
vip receptors (p b 0.05 or p b 0.01) (table 1; figs. 4, 5 and 6).
this confirmed that the enhancing effect of vip on pc synthesis
is mediated through vip receptors. at present, the signal
transduction pathways that regulate ps secretion have been
systemically studied. three major ones have been found till
now, which are activated adenylate cyclase that elevates the
intracellular camp level, phospholipase c that activates pkc
and elevated plasma ca2+ concentration that activates ca2+dependent protein kinase [16]. but little is known about the
signal transduction pathway that regulates ps phospholipids
synthesis. our laboratory previously reported that pkc and cfos protein played very important roles in et-1 induced pc (the
major component of ps) synthesis in in vitro cultured atii cells
[17]. the possible roles of pkc and c-fos protein in vip
induced pc synthesis were investigated in this work.
the c-fos oncogene was an immediate to early gene in the
signal transduction pathway. their transcription can be induced
rapidly by exogenous stimulations and in an hour their
transcription summit will be reached. after modification
(phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine), the translated
protein c-fos enters the nucleus and conjugates with another
oncogene product c-jun and forms the  xxxg1222xxx  ( xxxg1222xxx ), which is a transcription activator. ap-1 as the third
messenger can bind to ap-1 sites on many target genes through
their leu zip domain and regulate expression patterns of target
genes [18]. moody et al. reported that vip could upregulate c-

123

fos oncogene expression through its receptor mediation [19].
bakovic et al. found that there were four ap-1 binding sites
within the cct gene transcription-starting site (− 240 to
+35 bp) [20]. the major route for synthesis of pc is through
the cdp–choline pathway by which choline forms cdp–
choline by the sequential action of  xxxg445xxx  and ctp:
phospho-choline cytidylyltransferase (cct), and then cdp–
choline reacts with diacylgycerol and generates pc [21]. so the
quantity of [methyl-3h]choline incorporation is commonly used
as an index which reflects the variation of ps synthesis. cct is
the rate-limiting enzyme and regulatory site of pc's biosynthesis, and determines the synthesis rate of pc [22]. in our
previously work we have reported that vip upregulated the
activity of cct in atii cells [4]. in this work we further
demonstrated that vip elevated c-fos protein expression in
atii cells (p b 0.05) (figs. 2 and 3). this suggested that vip
might upregulate cct mrna transcription through ap-1
mediation, which finally led to enhanced pc synthesis. to
verify this hypothesis, as-odn of c-fos oncogene was used
to block its expression. the results demonstrated that the
enhancing effect of vip on c-fos protein expression (p b 0.05)
(figs. 2 and 3), quantity of [methyl-3h]choline incorporation
(p b 0.01) (table 1), lung explants microsomal cct activity
(p b 0.05) (table 1), cct mrna expression in lung explants
(p b 0.05) (fig. 4) and in atii cells (p b 0.05) (figs. 5 and 6)
could be blocked by as-odn of c-fos oncogene. but no such
effect could be found if the control s-odn was used. this
proved that c-fos protein was an important messenger in vip
enhanced expression of cct and synthesis of pc.
pkc, ca2+ and camp represent three different signal transduction pathways that regulate the expression of c-fos oncogene
[23]. schafer et al. reported that pituitary adenylate cyclase
activating peptide ( xxxg70xxx ), an analogy of vip, elevated c-fos
oncogene expression in pancreatic carcinoma cells by activating
pkc [24]. kiss also found that  xxxd2925xxx , a pkc agonist,
could enhance cct activity and pc synthesis, while cct
activity and pc synthesis would decline to the control level
when pkc activation was inhibited [25]. these results strongly
suggested that pkc might play a role in vip enhanced c-fos
expression and pc synthesis. when blocking pkc activity with
h7, we also found that the vip enhanced c-fos expression
(p b 0.05) (figs. 2 and 3), cct mrna level (p b 0.05) (figs. 4, 5
and 6), cct activity and pc synthesis (p b 0.05) (table 1)
declined to the control levels. this demonstrated that pkc was
the upstream messenger for vip enhanced c-fos expression,
cct activity and pc synthesis.
in conclusion, our results in this work demonstrated that
when binding to its receptors on the surface of atii cells, vip
activates pkc and elevates c-fos protein expression. and then
the transcriptional factor formed by c-fos protein and another
oncogene product c-jun bound to the ap-1 sites within the cct
gene transcription-starting site, which led to elevated cct
transcription and cct activity. this finally promoted pc
synthesis. our work shed the first light on the regulatory
mechanism of vip on the synthesis of ps and would provide
valuable clues for clinically using vip to cure lung lesions
caused by ps deficiency or dysfunction.
