aroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh) is enough
of a tongue-twister for patients and doctors alike and we
all teach the students that pnh is a disorder characterized by the triad of intravascular hemolysis, venous thrombosis and cytopenias.1-3 but in this journal, founded by adolfo
ferrata in the twenties, it seems appropriate to remember
that, in the italian literature, the full name coined for pnh in
1928 by ettore marchiafava was even more articulate: paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria with perpetual haemosiderinuria.4
the last qualification is not trivial, because even today the
accesses of hemoglobinuria, most distressing for the patient,
may tend to obscure the fact that in pnh hemolysis goes on
all the time: macroscopic hemoglobinuria merely reflects its
exacerbations.5
that in pnh hemolysis was complement-dependent has
also been known for a long time (figure 1): indeed, the acidified serum (or ham-dacie) test, based on complement-mediated lysis of pnh cells in vitro, has for half a century been the
gold standard for the diagnosis of pnh,7, 8 until flow cytometry came into its own.9, 10 therefore stopping hemolysis by
blocking complement was a logical idea: it did not seem easy
to achieve this safely in vivo. but the idea has become a reality through the advances of biotechnology, when alexion
developed a humanized anti- xxxg285xxx  monoclonal antibody,
eculizumab,11 which has proved highly effective in the control
of intravascular hemolysis in patients with pnh:12-14 a huge
step forward in the treatment of a disorder that until now
could be cured only by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.15-17
pnh is associated with the most vicious acquired thrombophilic state known to medicine, with nearly one-half of
untreated patients sooner or later affected: the consequences
are potentially devastating,5, 18-20 and it is humbling to admit
that we still don’t know the mechanism.21 there are two main
questions: (a) what triggers a major thrombotic event in an
individual patient, sometimes years into the course of the disease; (b) why are about one-half of the patients spared this
complication. until we know the answers to these questions,
they pose a difficult management problem. if a patient with
pnh is not given anti-coagulant prophylaxis, there is a significant risk that sooner or later that patient may develop a serious thrombotic complication.5, 22-24 on the other hand, if all
patients with pnh are given anticoagulant prophylaxis the
added burden is significant: in addition, it is unnecessary for
one-half of them, it does not completely prevent thrombosis,
and it entails the risk of serious hemorrhage.25 in view of this,
it has come as an added bonus that patients on eculizumab
therapy have a substantially lower risk of thrombosis.26
in this issue of haematologica, a paper by gerard socié’s

p

group27 deals with how eculizumab may influence venous
thrombosis in pnh, and peter hillmen’s group provide data28
on the recently developed notion29 that pnh patients on
eculizumab show evidence of extravascular hemolysis, which
may be an important determinant of the clinical response to
this new therapy.
socié et al. have systematically investigated patients on
eculizumab and they have found that, compared to pre-treatment values, they tend to have lower levels of coagulation factors such as von willebrandt factor, of by-products of coagulation such as d-dimers, and also of endothelial cell molecules
such as vcam. these findings do not resolve the issue as to
whether eculizumab prevents thrombosis indirectly by curbing intravascular hemolysis (which perhaps triggers thrombosis through the release of thromboplastin-like substances), or
whether it acts directly by blocking  xxxg285xxx  (which in turn might
activate platelets and/or the coagulation pathway)30.
however, the data provide evidence that in patients on
eculizumab there are changes in objective parameters that
may correlate with the risk of thrombosis, and this may also
help to unravel the puzzle of thrombophilia in pnh.
the paper by hillmen et al.28 reports that in 21 out of 31
pnh patients on eculizumab the direct antiglobulin test (dat)
was positive for c3 on  xxxd187xxx  (one was also weakly positive
for igg), whereas only one had been dat-positive before
treatment; in contrast, out of 39 pnh patients not on
eculizumab only 2 were dat-positive for c3. these data are
a clear confirmation of published work on a separate series of
pnh patients29 which had shown that: (i) the c3-positive red
cells belong entirely to the pnh red cell population; (b) the
proportion of c3-positive  xxxd187xxx  correlated with the reticulocyte count; (iii) some patients with a high proportion of c3positive  xxxd187xxx  had decreased in vivo survival of 51cr-labeled
 xxxd187xxx  with excess counts on spleen and liver, proving formally that they have extravascular hemolysis. hillmen et al.
provide further confirmation that these findings have important clinical implications: indeed, the mean hemoglobin level
was significantly higher in patients who, on eculizumab,
remained dat-negative. moreover, of the patients who
remained dat-negative only one (10%) has needed blood
transfusion, whereas of those who developed a positive c3
dat on eculizumab, 76% have needed at least one blood
transfusion.
these data illustrate a leitmotiv in the history of medicine:
any new therapy, even when it proves remarkably successful,
as is the case for eculizumab, may have limitations; at the
same time, a new therapy can give us new insights into the
pathophysiology of the disease it treats. with respect to the
risk of thrombosis, it is unlikely that a prospective clinical trial

523

may be conducted. therefore, it will be important to confirm the current notion that eculizumab is protective,26, 31
whatever the mechanism, by independent datasets with
sufficient longitudinal follow-up. in addition, in the case of
a patient on eculizumab who has had a previous thrombotic event, a tricky problem is whether prophylactic anticoagulation32 can or ought to be discontinued. again, it is
unlikely that this issue will be addressed by an ad hoc clinical trial; however, observation of patients in whom anticoagulation has been withdrawn because of hemorrhagic
complications may provide hints for an educated case by
case clinical decision.

as for opsonization of gpi(-)  xxxd187xxx  by c3, this is probably favored by  xxxg394xxx  deficiency. in untreated patients
with pnh, the  xxxd187xxx  that have bound c3 will selectively activate  xxxg285xxx  and will hence succumb to the membrane
attack complex (mac). for this reason we practically
never see a positive dat in a newly diagnosed pnh
patient (figure 1b). in contrast, once  xxxg285xxx  is blocked by
eculizumab, gpi(-) c3-coated  xxxd187xxx  have a chance to
accumulate, and they will become prey to phagocytosis by
macrophages (figure 1c). thus, it is likely that the phenomenon of c3 binding is simply being unmasked by
eculizumab; but the consequent extravascular hemolysis is

figure 1. the complement cascade regulation and erythrocytes. (a) normal erythrocytes
are protected from complement activation and subsequent hemolysis by  xxxg394xxx  and
cd59. these two proteins,
being gpi-linked, are missing
from the surface of pnh red
cells as a result of a somatic
mutation of the x-linked pig-a
gene, that encodes a protein
required for an early step of the
gpi molecule biosynthesis.6 (b)
in the steady state, pnh erythrocytes suffer from spontaneous (tick-over) complement
activation, with consequent
intravascular
hemolysis
through formation of the mac;
exacerbated hemolysis will
result from activation of extra
complement through the classical pathway. (c) on eculizumab,
pnh erythrocytes are protected
from hemolysis from the inhibition of  xxxg285xxx  cleavage; however,
upstream complement activation may lead to c3 opsonization and possible extravascular
hemolysis. here “c3 convertase” represents either the
c3bbb complex (alternative
pathway) or the c4b2a complex (classical and lectin pathways).

really a new phenomenon. since the majority of patients
on eculizumab have a persistent (though usually mild)
reticulocytosis, this phenomenon is probably the rule
rather than the exception: however, fortunately in many
cases it seems to have little or no clinical relevance.
the very trial that proved the success of eculizumab in
pnh patients with severe hemolysis produced a dichotomy between those who became transfusion-independent
and those who did not.13, 14 it seems likely that this dichotomy results at least to a large extent from how many of their
pnh  xxxd187xxx  bind c3 and we must find out what factors
influence the quantity and/or quality of this binding. in this
respect, a major question is how to manage c3-mediated
extravascular hemolysis in those patients in whom this creates a clinical problem, especially in view of the attendant
risk of iron overload, a complication previously unknown
in pnh. it is questionable whether corticosteroids might
be effective but many patients with pnh have already suffered from the side effects of chronic administration of
these agents, and it would not be desirable to subject them
to these once again. other forms of immunosuppression
and intravenous ig may or may not work but they would
certainly be an added burden. splenectomy has been
reported effective in one patient33 but since it increases the
risk of infection and thrombosis one would never recommend it as a standard measure. speculative approaches for
the future might include: (a) targeting the complement cascade upstream of  xxxg285xxx ; (b) interfering with the interactions
between c3-opsonized  xxxd187xxx  and macrophages; (c) targeting the interaction between c3 and the  xxxd187xxx  themselves. in this respect, one of us has reported recently34 that
tt30, a recombinant human protein consisting of the
fusion of the ic3b/c3d-binding region of complement
receptor 2 with the functional domains of the complement
regulator factor h, is able to prevent hemolysis of pnh red
cells in vitro. in essence, tt30 seems to surrogate the function of  xxxg394xxx , lacking on pnh  xxxd187xxx , by inhibiting c3
activation and deposition on  xxxd187xxx , thus blocking the
formation and activity on their surface of the c3 convertase. of course, it is unlikely that we can safely get rid of
complement altogether, and it remains to be seen whether
such modes of complement blockade will be as safe as
blocking just  xxxg285xxx .
in conclusion, with the introduction of eculizumab in the
first decade of this century we have for the first time a specific medicine for pnh. for many patients this has meant
having pnh without hemoglobinuria, without numerous
unpleasant symptoms, without depending on blood transfusion, and with a much reduced risk of venous thrombosis. for the rest of the patients, in the next decade we have
to find out how best to control extravascular hemolysis.
for all patients, we are still left with the challenge of developing a form of medical treatment that will not only control but actually eradicate pnh.

lonal hematopoiesis is a key feature of myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpn), a hematopoietic stem
cell disorder comprising three disease entities:
polycythemia vera (pv), essential thrombocytosis (et)
and primary myelofibrosis (pmf). although the clinical
characteristics of these three diseases are quite distinct,
they do share genetic mutations that drive clonal myeloproliferation, which is their common defining feature.
continual technological advances have led to the identification of increasing numbers of genetic defects in mpn
patients. in this issue of haematologica, stegelmann et al.1
present their results from a genome-wide singlenucleotide polymorphism (snp) profiling study in a large
cohort of mpn patients that significantly furthers our
understanding of the molecular causes and diversity of
mpn.

genetic defects driving clonality in myeloproliferative
neoplasms
the identification of activating mutations in the gene
coding for the  xxxg2198xxx  jak2 (jak2-v617f and
jak2 exon 12 mutations) in almost all pv patients and in
a large percentage of et and pmf patients,2-7 led to a
series of follow-up studies to investigate their functional
consequences.8 nevertheless, how a single mutation can
contribute to the pathogenesis of three phenotypically

526

distinct disease entities is still largely unclear. one study,
using a jak2-v617f transgenic mouse model, suggested
that the disease phenotype could be determined by the
ratio of mutant jak2 to wild-type protein.9 however,
there is growing evidence for a more complex mechanism
of mpn phenotype initiation. observations of strain-specific differences in jak2-v617f-associated disease phenotypes between balb/c and c57bl/6 mice suggest an
involvement of germ line features in the resultant phenotype.8 however, besides jak2 mutations and other oncogenic events targeting the jak-stat pathway (such as
mutations in the mpl gene, coding for the  xxxg2282xxx  receptor and truncations of the  xxxg718xxx ),8 there are still many uncharacterized somatic cytogenetic lesions present within the mpn clone, harboring a
series of candidates for both the induction of clonal
expansion and the mpn phenotype decision.

classical cytogenetic methods made it possible to detect
large genetic aberrations in patients with specific diseases
which revealed cytogenetic lesions usually containing a
large number of genes. recurrent defects found in mpn,
such as the deletions on chromosome 20q (del20q) and
13q (del13q), are thought to harbor important tumor sup-
