the first case of an infant with intractable seizures controlled by

birth.2 the onset of seizures is often in the first few hours after birth
but in

some cases

may not present for

days or rarely weeks after

birth. very rarely, atypical cases may have onset of seizures up to
2 years of age.3 some clinicians have suggested that the late onset

seizures to

intrauterine fetal movements that are dysrhythmic without other

signs of spontaneous activity seen on abdominal ultrasound.6 in
addition to seizures, symptoms at onset in infants may include
poor peripheral perfusion, hypothermia, abdominal distention,
and vomiting.
the diagnosis of pyridoxine-dependent seizures is often
delayed and is probably underdiagnosed .4,7 pyridoxine dependency

developmental milestones for walking and talking are present in
66% of patients. visual and motor impairments are very common .3
delayed development, especially in speech and expressive language, is also common. oral motor dyspraxia and dystonia with later

case report
our patient was previously described as an infant.l9 a male was born to

a

28-year-old gravida 2, para 1 mother at 38 weeks’ gestation. pregnancy and
delivery were uncomplicated. fetal movements were normal. prenatal vitamins containing 4 mg of pyridoxine were taken daily during the second
and third trimesters. 19 apgar scores were 9 at 1 and 5 minutes after birth,
and resuscitation or oxygen was not required.
shortly after birth, the infant became irritable. within 24 hours, grunting respiration was noted. at 24 hours of age, seizures began, characteristic of mouthing movements and multifocal myoclonic jerks. this seizure
activity was unresponsive to anticonvulsants. at 40 hours of age, pyridoxine was given and moments later seizure activity ceased. an extensive
metabolic work-up was normal. at a later date, pyridoxine was discontinued and 1 day later, myoclonic jerks were noted. pyridoxine was then
restarted.

at age 15 years, the patient continues to require pyridoxine. he also
has seizures that may be independent of the pyridoxine dependency and
are partially responsive to anticonvulsants. currently, he is being treated
with both pyridoxine and anticonvulsants. he has been taking  xxxd3049xxx 
200 mg 6 times per day, gabapentin 420 mg tid, topiramate 25 mg bid, and
 xxxd3485xxx  sprinkles 1000 mg per day. the patient has had globally delayed
developmental milestones. as an infant and preschooler, he had marked interpersonal avoidance. until age 4, he would relate to other individuals primarily
as objects. by age 5, he had not acquired any language. he had developed
a preferred preoccupation in which he would turn himself in a counterclockwise direction while humming and rhythmically shaking objects from
his hand. also at age 5, he was given a 3-month empirical trial of magnesium lactate as per the recommendations of martineau et al, in conjunction
with his anticonvulsant doses of pyridoxine. 20 our target was to ameliorate
autistic symptomatology and possibly his seizure disorder as well. we
observed no substantive change in either of these conditions. at age 15, he
is noncommunicative. he uses less than 10 words. he has had severe and
persistent behavior problems. he is heavily involved in self-stimulation. he
performs aerophagia and breath-holding activities several hundred times
per day. he is unable to perform simple self-care tasks and has been oppositional and destructive at times. additionally, he hits his head, hits his ears,
and scratches his neck. he has

numerous

complex rituals. an electroen-

cephalogram at the age of 15 failed to show a specific clinical correlation
of epileptiform activity with either aerophagia or breath holding. however,
a video-linked electroencephalogram has not been completed.

his adaptive behaviors on the vineland adaptive behavior scale were
communication, 11 months; daily living skills, 23 months; and socialization,
10 months, with an adaptive behavior composite level of 15 months. his iq
is below 30. on the autism behavior checklist, he has a score of 91, placing
him in the severe range of autistic disorder. his greatest impairments were
in sensory, social, and self-help skills.
his mother’s father has a sister who is mentally retarded without
autistic features and without seizures. there is no other family history of
seizures or of developmental disabilities.
his current diagnoses are autistic disorder, severe mental retardation,
seizure disorder, and pyridoxine dependency.

an ardent proponent of such a link is riniland.30~31 the existence
a link has been challenged more than once.32,33 at age 5,
patient already had been on what would be considered megadoses of pyridoxine for his seizures, with no apparent benefit to
his autism. the addition of magnesium likewise produced no benefit. on the other hand, it could be argued that whatever factor led
to an incomplete response to pyridoxine in his seizure disorder
also mitigated any potential therapeutic effect or preventive effect

pyridoxine dependency is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder
that causes a severe seizure disorder of prenatal or neonatal onset.
these seizures do not usually respond to anticonvulsants but cease
within minutes following parenteral administration of pyridoxine.

how-

previously reported as a common outcome in patients with pyridoxine-dependent seizures. our patient exhibited a rather striking
high-frequency pattern of self-stimulatory, stereotypic breath-holding spells, in addition to aerophagia and self-injurious behavior. as
other cases of pyridoxine-dependent seizures and autism come to
light, it will be interesting to note if stereotypic breath holding is
a common accompaniment. additional studies will be necessary
to determine if pyridoxine-dependent seizures and pyridoxineresponsive seizures have a single genotype or if phenotype variance
is associated with multiple genotypes. in patients like the one
described above, improved understanding of this relationship
would enhance both diagnosis and treatment of patients with
more complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

ever, nabbout et al suggest that onset of seizures in the prenatal period may be associated with poor developmental outcomes.’7

in addition to seizures, the neurobehavioral phenotype of the

some complications related to use of pyridoxine have been
reported. toxicity with megadoses (2 to 6 grams per day) taken for
conditions unrelated to pyridoxine-dependent seizures can result
in peripheral sensory impairment, ataxia, and widespread nonspecific axonal degeneration.21 in animal studies, there have been
reports of reduced spermatogenesis, decreased sperm motility,
and decrease in testis weight associated with high-dose vitamin b66

case report

4-year-old girl diagnosed with neurofibromatosis-1 at 2 years of age had
developed right optic pathway glioma and after having a total 5500 cgy dose
of radiotherapy was free of her tumor. two years later, she came to the emergency department with complaints of headache, nausea, convulsions, and
left hemiparesis. she had developed marked psychomotor retardation
within the past 6 months and had had a similar left hemiplegic attack 5
months previously, which had resolved without any neurologic sequelae.
physical examination revealed an unconscious, mute girl unable to
walk, with a muscle power of 1/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right upper extremities. she also had left central facial paralysis, hyperactive deep tendon
reflexes, and a babinski reflex of the left lower extremity. more than 10 cafe
au lait spots larger than 1 cm were scattered over her body.
laboratory examinations, including complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; chest radiography; serum glucose, urea, and creatinine ; serum transaminase activities; serum c reactive protein, and tests
for coagulation disorders, were all within normal ranges. cranial computed tomography (ct) revealed multiple low-density areas in the right
frontal, temporal, and occipital areas consistent with cerebral infarctions.
cranial ct also detected cerebral atrophy of the right temporoparietooccipital areas, and ventricular dilation. cranial magnetic resonance angiography showed the obliteration of the right carotid artery and flow
disturbances and wall irregularities at the narrowed distal portion of the
left carotid artery (figure 1a and b). hexamethylpropylenamine oxime cerebral single photon emission computed tomographic imaging revealed absent
perfusion of the right and decreased perfusion of the left hemisphere.
renal angiography and abdominal ultrasonography were within normal
limits. electroencephalography showed increased slow-wave activity.
