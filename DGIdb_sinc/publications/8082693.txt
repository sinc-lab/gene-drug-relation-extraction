abstract

in the present work, the effects of neurotransmitter antagonists on theophylline-induced changes in body temperature were
investigated. intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a low dose of theohylline (25 mg/kg) induced slight hyperthermia, while high
doses (75 and 100 mg/kg) induced hypothermia. the hypothermic effect of theophylline was decreased by pretreatment of
animals with the dopamine d 2 receptor antagonists sulpiride (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) and  xxxd2956xxx  (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg i.p.),
the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg i.p.) and the 5-ht receptor antagonist metergoline (0.25 mg/kg
i.p.). however, the dopamine d 1 receptor antagonist sch 23390 (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p.), the a-adrenoceptor antagonist
phenoxybenzamine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg i.p.) and the/3-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) did not alter the
theophylline response. in reserpinized mice, theophylline caused a dose-dependent rise in body temperature. the response was
blocked in animals pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and atropine. single treatment of animals with either sch
23390 or sulpiride, and also with a combination of the two drugs, decreased the hyperthermia induced by theophylline in
reserpinized mice.  xxxd2956xxx  or metergoline did not have any effect in this respect. these data suggest that the hypothermic
response to theophylline may be mediated through dopaminergic, cholinergic and serotonergic mechanisms. the hyperthermic
action of theophylline in reserpinized animals may be mediated through dopaminergic, cholinergic and adrenergic systems.
overall it seems likely that theophylline interacts with modulatory mechanisms involved in thermoregulation.
key words: theophylline; dopamine receptor antagonist; reserpine; temperature; (mouse)

1. introduction

central nervous system and peripheral autonomic
mechanisms are involved in the thermoregulation of
mammals. central monoamines appear to play important roles in the regulation of body temperature. in
general, serotonin and the catecholamines have been
associated with heat production and heat loss (schlosberg, 1983). methylxanthines have numerous actions
on a variety of physiological systems, some of which
have already been shown to be involved in thermoregulation. the brain levels of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) a n d / o r 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the
major breakdown product of serotonin) in rodents are
significantly elevated following the administration of
caffeine, theophylline or  xxxd150xxx  (berkowitz and

spector, 1971; paalzow and paalzow, 1974; curzon and
fernando, 1976; schlosberg et al., 1981). some evidence suggests that these agents increase the turnover
of norepinephrine (berkowitz et al., 1970; corrodi et
al., 1972; waldeck, 1971). whether the alkaloids increase or decrease the turnover of dopamine may be
related to the drug dose (corrodi et al., 1972; paalzow
and paalzow, 1974; waldeck, 1971). methylxanthines
elicit an increase in neurotransmitter release (waldeck,
1971; stone, 1981; dunwiddie, 1985) which is thought
to be the result of antagonism of the inhibitory effects
of endogenous adenosine (harms et al., 1978, 1979).
since a number of central and peripheral sites of
action of methylxanthines include some of the underlying mechanisms concerned with body temperature regulation, one would expect these alkaloids to have specific effects on thermoregulation.
there are reports showing that moderate to high
doses of theophylline and caffeine induce hypothermia

in rats (berkowitz et al., 1971; estler, 1979; schlosberg,
1983; spindel et al., 1983; pohorecky et al., 1989;
kalhorn et al., 1990) and mice (carney et al., 1985;
durcan and morgan, 1991, 1992). however, low doses
of theophylline and caffeine have been reported to
raise body temperature in rats (thithapanda et al.,
1972; lin et al., 1980; schlosberg, 1983). in the present
study, the mechanism(s) involved in the body temperature changes induced by theophylline have been investigated.

2. material

and method

(schering, italy), sulpiride (delagrange),  xxxd2956xxx 
(janssen), propranolol (ici), phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride (skf), metergoline (pharmitalia), reserpine
(ciba-geigy) and  xxxd247xxx  (e. merck). the
drugs were dissolved in physiological saline except reserpine, sulpiride,  xxxd2956xxx  and sch 23390 which
were dissolved in a drop of acetic acid and then diluted
with saline. the drugs were prepared immediately before injection and were administered in volume of 10
ml/kg. the pretreatment time and the doses of antagonists were made as in our previous studies (zarrindast
and abolfathi-araghi, 1992; zarrindast and tabatabai,
1992). all the drugs were injected intraperitoneally
(i.p.).

2.1. subjects
male swiss albino mice from the pasteur institute
(iran), weighing 22-28 g, were used for all experiments. the animals were housed ten per cage at an
ambient temperature (24 + 2°c) with free access to
food and water. they were kept on a 12-h light/dark
schedule. each animal was only used once.
2. 2. temperature recording
on the day of the experiment, the mice were housed
individually in experimental cages (at 24 + 2°c) and
allowed to acclimatize for 1 h before drug injection.
during this period, body temperature was measured at
10 min intervals in order to exclude the effect of
handling and thermistor probe on animal temperature.
body temperature was measured with a rectal thermistor probe (light lab, brighton, uk; sensitivity 0.1°c)
inserted into the rectum to a depth of 2 cm. the data
are presented as changes in rectal temperature from
the basal values. basal values are those taken immediately before theophylline administration (time 0) after
saline or antagonist injection. when saline or theophylline was used alone, the basal values are the values
taken immediately before the administration of saline
or theophylline (time 0). experiments took place between 8.00 and 14.00 h.

4. discussion

our present results indicate that theophylline, depending on the doses employed, changes the body
temperature of mice. low doses of the drug tend to
induce hyperthermia, while high doses cause hypothermia. the results are in agreement with those obtained
by others who reported hyperthermia with low doses of
methylxanthines (thithapanda et al., 1972; lin et al.,
1980; schlosberg, 1983) or hypothermia with high doses
(berkowitz et al., 1971; estler, 1979; schlosberg, 1983;
spindel et al., 1983; carney et al., 1985; pohorecky et
al., 1989; kalhorn et al., 1990; durcan and morgan,
1991, 1992) in mice and rats.
it is well known that theophylline has an antagonistic effect on adenosine receptors (daly, 1982; bruns et
al., 1986). adenosine a 1 receptor activation has been
suggested to inhibit the dopamine release in the brain
(wood et al., 1989) and thus theophylline as an adenosine receptor antagonist may release dopamine. the
dopamine release elicited by theophylline (lin et al.,
1980) and the hypothermia elicited by dopamine agonists (zarrindast and tabatabai, 1992) have been reported previously. since the dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonists  xxxd2956xxx  (christensen et al., 1984; morley
et al., 1987) and sulpiride (di chiara et al., 1976; stool
and kebabian, 1984) decreased the hypothermic effect
of theophylline, indirect dopaminergic mechanisms may
be involved. however, there are reports indicating that
 xxxd2956xxx  (estler, 1979) and haloperidol (durcan and
morgan, 1992) do not significantly influence the hypothermia induced by caffeine. the involvement of
presynaptic dopamine d 2 receptors in hypothermia
was proposed in our previous study (zarrindast and
tabatabai, 1992). therefore, the involvement of presynaptic d 2 dopaminergic mechanisms in the theophylline-evoked hypothermic response seems likely.
in the present study, high doses of sulpiride failed to
prevent the theophylline-induced hypothermia and
when employed alone tended to decrease the body
temperature, although the latter response was not significant. postsynaptic dopamine d 2 receptors have
been shown to be involved in hyperthermia (zarrindast
and tabatabai, 1992). high doses of sulpiride may
block postsynaptic dopamine d 2 receptors and in turn
decreases body temperature by masking the endogenous dopamine response and may even block the
dopaminergic effect of theophylline, which may be
involved in hyperthermia. this can change the thermoregulatory balance causing a hypothermic response.

therefore this may be a reason for the failure of high
doses of sulpiride to block the hypothermia induced by
theophylline. however, more experiments are required.
since the dopamine d~ receptor antagonist sch 23390
(hyttel, 1984) did not alter the decrease in body temperature induced by theophylline, the involvement of
dopamine 91 receptor is excluded in this respect. this
is also consistent with our previous results (zarrindast
and tabatabai, 1992).
atropine also reduced the hypothermic effect of
theophylline, and therefore the involvement of cholinergic mechanisms cannot be excluded. adenosine receptors have been shown to regulate the release of
acetylcholine (brown et al., 1990), and this may be an
explanation for the atropine effect. the hypothermic
effect of theophylline was decreased by metergoline in
the present experiments; however, the effect of caffeine was not altered by the 5-ht receptor antagonist
(durcan and morgan, 1992). therefore the role of a
serotonergic mechanism should be investigated further
in this respect. since propranolol and phenoxybenzamine did not alter the hypothermic effect of theophylline, a role of the adrenergic system is excluded.
these results are in agreement with those of durcan
and morgan (1992). theophylline is also a phosphodiesterase inhibitor at high doses (choi et al., 1988). this
mechanism may be involved in the theophylline response. the role of phosphodiesterase inhibition in the
hypothermic action of methylxanthines proposed by
others (durcan and morgan, 1991-1992) also supports
this hypothesis. theophylline raised body temperature
in reserpine-treated mice, which may emphasize the
indirect aminergic involvement in this respect. this
effect of reserpine also shows that the integrity of
dopaminergic neurons is required for the hypothermic
effect of theophylline. the rise in body temperature
induced by theophylline in reserpinized mice was decreased by both the dopamine d 1 receptor antagonist
sch 23390 and the dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist
sulpiride alone and by a combination of both antagonists. thus one may expect that the hyperthermic response of theophylline is mediated through dopamine
mechanisms. since the animals were reserpinized, the
effect of theophylline may be mediated either by a
indirect amphetamine-like mechanism, through release
of dopamine from the newly synthesized dopamine
pool (kuczenski, 1983; rebec, 1987) or by a direct
dopaminergic effect (arbuthnott et al., 1974; fuxe and
ungerstedt, 1974; fredholm et al., 1976) which may be
involved in the modulation of thermoregulation. however, some authors indicate that methylxanthines have
direct dopamine agonist activity (watanabe et al., 1981;
herrera-marschitz et al., 1988, casas et al., 1989). in
our present work, a selective dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonist,  xxxd2956xxx  (christensen et al., 1984), did not
decrease the hyperthermia induced by theophylline in

m.-r. zarrindast, m.-r. heidari / european journal of pharmacology 257 (1994) 13-20

reserpine-treated animals. the difference between the
antagonistic effects of  xxxd2956xxx  and sulpiride has been
shown previously.  xxxd2956xxx  decreases the effect of
both bromocriptine and quinpirole on feeding, while
sulpiride decreases the response of quinpirole, but not
that of bromocriptine (zarrindast et al., 1991).
considering the possible involvement of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in hyperthermia (zarrindast
and tabatabai, 1992), the failure of  xxxd2956xxx  to prevent theophylline-evoked hypothermia may indicate
that the drug exerts a presynaptic dopamine d 2 receptor antagonistic effect rather than a postsynaptic one.
other antagonists, atropine, phenoxybenzamine and
propranolol, also blocked the hyperthermic effect of
theophylline in reserpinized mice, which may indicate
that cholinergic and adrenergic systems are partly responsible for this effect of theophylline. since metergoline did not alter the hyperthermic effect of theophylline, the role of serotonergic systems can be excluded
in the response. considering the possible amphetamine-like properties of theophylline and blockade of theophylline-induced hyperthermia by adrenergic antagonists in reserpinized animals, our results may
be in agreement with the proposed mechanism of action of methylxanthines to increase the synthesis and
levels of brain monoamines (snyder and waldeck, 1974;
schlosberg et al., 1981). finally, more studies are
needed to evaluate the possible influence of a change
in locomotion on the theophylline response. as the
high doses of theophylline used in the present work
usually calmed the animals, one could speculate that
part of the hypothermia is due to a decrease in locomotion. however, sulpiride, which itself decreases locomotion, prevented the hypothermia induced by
theophylline. thus more studies are required to clarify
the exact influence of locomotion on the theophylline
effect.
