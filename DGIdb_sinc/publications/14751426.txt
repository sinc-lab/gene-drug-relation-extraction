abstract
purpose: the goal of the present study was to determine the effects of clozapine (cloz) and its metabolites norclozapine (norcloz) and
clozapine-n-oxide (cloz-n-oxide) on the  xxxg1113xxx  system on the levels of protein and gene expression in in vitro systems of primary
cortical cells of the rat and human hippocampal shs5y5 neuroblastoma cells. methods: clinically relevant concentrations of cloz (200/400
ng/ml) and its metabolites (200 ng/ml) were used for the examination of the effects of cloz and its metabolites on serotoninergic 5-ht2
receptor parameters (density, affinity and mrna levels) as well as on  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx ) mrna levels
in primary cortical cells of the rat after treatment for 24 h under in vitro conditions. to compare the results to human cells, we also measured
treatment-induced changes in 5-ht2 and  xxxg861xxx  mrna levels in human hippocampal shs5y5 cells. results: a significant decrease was
found in primary cortical cells for  xxxg1113xxx  density (cloz 200/cloz 400/norcloz 200 and cloz-n-oxide 200 vs. control) and 5-ht2a
receptor mrna levels (cloz 200 vs. control).  xxxg1113xxx  mrna levels were also significantly reduced (norcloz 200 vs. control) in
shs5y5 cells.  xxxg861xxx  mrna levels were not affected. conclusions: the results of the present study show that cloz and norcloz induce
significant alterations on the  xxxg1113xxx  system in primary cortical cells of the rat and in human hippocampal cells.

1. introduction
the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine (cloz) exerts
several actions on the serotoninergic system (ase et al., 1999;
buckland et al., 1997; matsubara and meltzer, 1989). blood
levels of serotonin were found to be significantly increased in
cloz-treated young schizophrenic patients compared with
young schizophrenic patients treated with conventional antipsychotics (schulz et al., 1997). ichikawa et al. (1998)
reported that cloz and risperidone significantly increased
extracellular serotonin concentrations in the rat medial frontal
cortex and in the nucleus accumbens, whereas olanzapine,

haloperidol failed to induce significant effects in either
region. however, long-term treatment with cloz decreased
serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in
the striatum of rats with similar trends in cortex and hippocampus (burnet et al., 1996a). in other animal trials performed on rodents, treatment with cloz for 21 days resulted in
an increase of serotonin in the ventral hippocampus, ventral
caudal neostriatum and nucleus raphe dorsalis but in a
decrease in the mediodorsal and laterodorsal neostriatum as
well as in the substantia nigra (ase et al., 1999). there are
some results that indicate that norclozapine (norcloz) is the
neurobiologically active metabolite of cloz (guitton et al.,
1998). moreover, norcloz, but not clozapine-n-oxide (clozn-oxide), has the same  xxxg656xxx  affinity as cloz (odou et
al., 1996). regarding  xxxg1113xxx  affinity, cloz has about
the same affinity as norcloz (seeman, 1993).
because many, although heterogeneous, alterations of
this system have been found in schizophrenic patients
(burnet et al., 1996b; dean et al., 1996; grace, 2000;

298

joseph et al., 1979; joyce et al., 1993), serotoninergic
parameters seem to be relevant for the pathogenesis and
also for the treatment of schizophrenia. overall, the 5-ht2
receptor seems to be an important serotoninergic receptor
for the etiology and the therapy of various psychiatric
disorders (peroutka, 1998; sanders-bush, 1998).
willins et al. (1997) demonstrated that 5-ht2a receptors
are expressed in pyramidal cells and interneurons in the rat
cortex. these 5-ht2a receptors are down-regulated following single or chronic cloz administration. a single administration of cloz (20 mg/kg) induced a decrease in 5-ht2
receptor density, while no changes were seen concerning the
affinity (matsubara and meltzer, 1989). in another study,
burnet et al. (1996a) demonstrated a decrease of 5-ht2a
receptor mrna levels and density of the  xxxg1113xxx 
after treatment with cloz (25 mg/kg/day) for 14 days.
buckland et al. (1997) found a decrease in  xxxg1113xxx 
mrna levels in some brain regions after treatment with
cloz (10 mg/kg/day) for 32 days. moreover, treatment of
rats with cloz for 7 days induced an increase in intracellular
 xxxg1113xxx -like immunoreactivity in pyramidal neurons while causing a decrease in the labeling of apical
dendrites in the medial prefrontal cortex. in contrast, treatment with haloperidol did not induce such a redistribution of
5-ht2a receptors in pyramidal neurons in the medial
prefrontal cortex, pointing to a specific effect of the atypical
antipsychotic cloz (willins et al., 1999). all these investigations have been performed in vivo.
overall, the detailed actions of cloz and its metabolites
on neuronal and especially serotoninergic components in the
brain are still quite unclear. the authors therefore used for
the first time an in vitro approach with systems of primary
cortical cells of the rat and human hippocampal shs5y5
cells to determine the effects of the atypical antipsychotic
cloz and its metabolites on the  xxxg1113xxx  on the level
of protein (density and affinity) and on the level of gene
expression (mrna).

2. methods
2.1. preparation and incubation of cortex cells and shs5y5
neuroblastoma cells
cortical brain cultures were derived from the brains of
embryonic day 18 fetal rats by microdissection. dissociated
cells were plated at a density of 4  106 cells in 24-well
plates (nunc, wiesbaden, germany; vedder et al., 1993).
cultures were fed twice a week with start v medium
(seromed, berlin, germany) and used for the experiments at
days 7 and 8 of culture.
human hippocampal shs5y5 neuroblastoma cells were
received from prof. mennel (department of neuropathology, philipps-university, marburg, germany) and cultured in
rpmi 1640 medium (buffalo, ny) supplemented with 15%
fetal calf serum (fcs; sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, ger-

many) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (seromed).
for experiments, 2  105 shs5y5 cells were plated in petri
dishes.
for experiments, cultures were incubated with 10 ml
start v medium for 24 h. the medium contained different concentrations of cloz (200/400 ng/ml), norcloz (200
ng/ml) and cloz-n-oxide (200 ng/ml; novartis, nürnberg,
germany), respectively. the pure medium served as a
control. after the incubation time, two washing steps were
performed and the supernatant was discharged. cells for the
determination of mrna were dissolved in trizol (life
technologies, frederick, md, usa). for the determination
of  xxxg1113xxx  binding, cells were washed twice with
10 ml gaintner wash buffer and sampled in gaintner
original buffer (gaintner et al., 1962) for the measurement
of the  xxxg1113xxx  density (bmax) and affinity (kd). all
samples were subsequently frozen in 80 jc.
2.2. measurement of  xxxg1113xxx  density and affinity
 xxxg1113xxx  density (bmax) and affinity (kd) were
determined using [3h]lsd (nen, zaventem, belgium) as
receptor agonist (schreiber et al., 1997). the specific
binding (sb) of [3h]lsd was assessed using five different
ligand concentrations both in the presence and in the
absence of the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist spiperone (600
nm) as a cold displacer. fifty microliters of each concentration were added to 500 al of the cortex cell suspension
and incubated in gaintner buffer at 37 jc for 2 h. adding
ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx  and filtration through a cell harvester
terminated the binding. then, the filters were superfused
with scintillation liquid for another 4 h before the radioactivity was quantified. sb was calculated by subtracting
nonspecific binding (nsb) from total binding at each
radioligand concentration. for further calculation of data,
michaelis –menten and lineweaver –burk analyses were
performed (schreiber et al., 1997; thomas et al., 1987).
protein concentrations were measured with a bca protein
kit from pierce (rockford, il, usa; bollag et al., 1996)
and samples were adjusted for equal protein levels. no
significant differences of protein levels between the various
treatments were detected.
2.3. extraction and quantification of mrna by reverse
transcriptase (rt)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
methods
after defrosting of the samples, mrna was extracted
according to standard methods (peqlab extraction kit,
peqlab, erlangen, germany). the amounts of extracted
mrna were quantified by established optical methods at
a260/a280 (genequant ii, pharmacia biotech, freiburg,
germany) and structural integrity was determined by
agarose gel electrophoresis (1.0% agarose, gibco-brl,
dreieich, germany). equivalent amounts of mrna were
used for the reaction with rt (superscript ii rnase h

were performed as post hoc tests. the statistics were
carried out using sigmastat software (jandel scientific,

as in shs5y5 cells for 5-ht2a (40 cycles) and  xxxg861xxx 
(28 cycles). amplification products were subjected to gel
electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels. semiquantitative
determination was achieved by digitization of gels with
a polaroid video system (rothaar and schroeder, heidelberg, germany) and further densitometric evaluation with
the bio-1d program (vilbert lourmat, marne la vallée,
france). the results are expressed in percentages of the
respective control condition. the samples were analyzed
in parallel for  xxxg861xxx  to exclude variations in the pcr
amplification and the quantification process (vedder et
al., 1999).

in the present study in primary cortical cells of the rat and
in human hippocampal cells, we investigated the serotoninergic  xxxg1113xxx  system after incubation with cloz and
its metabolites. the serotoninergic parameters examined
consisted of the 5-ht2 density and affinity as well as 5ht2a receptor mrna levels. to compare the results to
human cells, we also measured  xxxg1113xxx  mrna
levels in hippocampal shs5y5 cells. levels of  xxxg861xxx 
were used as controls to detect possible differences in the
treatment, sampling and pcr process. as shown, no relevant changes were detected in the course of the studies.

p. heiser et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 28 (2004) 297–302

subsequently,  xxxg1113xxx  rna changes were analyzed separately.
for the experiments, we used cloz in concentrations of
200 and 400 ng/ml and cloz-n-oxide/norcloz in concentrations of 200 ng/ml. these concentrations were used
because in clinical practice serum levels of cloz and its
metabolites are usually between 100 and 400 ng/ml (abidargham et al., 1997; ohuoha et al., 1993; remschmidt
et al., 1994; schulz et al., 1997), although data from animal
experiments point to somewhat higher brain levels in
relation to serum levels (baldessarini et al., 1993).
the results of the present study show that cloz and its
metabolites norcloz and cloz-n-oxide lead to significant
alterations in some of the parameters examined in our system.
significant effects were detected for  xxxg1113xxx 
density, which was decreased by all treatments under investigation (cloz 200 and 400, norcloz and cloz-n-oxide 200)
compared with the control condition. this basically confirms
the results of an earlier in vivo study. matsubara and meltzer
(1989) reported the down-regulation of binding sites in the
rat cerebral cortex following a single injection of cloz. this
is characteristic for some but not all atypical antipsychotics.
regarding the  xxxg1113xxx  affinity (kd), no significant
treatment effects were detected. this again is in line with the
in vivo results of matsubara and meltzer (1989).
with regard to  xxxg1113xxx  mrna levels in primary
cortical cells of the rat, a significant reduction of about 25%
could be demonstrated for cloz 200 compared with the
control conditions. the decrease is in line with previous in
vivo studies. treatment of rats with cloz (10 mg/kg/day) for
32 days resulted in a 15 – 40% decrease of 5-ht2a mrna
levels in hippocampus, brainstem and midbrain (buckland
et al., 1997). fourteen days of cloz administration (25 mg/
kg/day) decreased 5-ht2a mrna levels and the density of
5-ht2a receptors in the cingulate and frontal cortex but not
in the piriform cortex of rats (burnet et al., 1996a).
our results on the treatment-induced changes of 5-ht2a
receptor mrna levels in human hippocampal shs5y5
cells showed a significant decrease of about 50% in the
cells incubated with norcloz 200, the active metabolite of
cloz. the reason for this result might be an uptake and the
metabolization of the drugs in these cells. such a mechanism with a specific rank order (norcloz>cloz>cloz-noxide) has been described for cells of blood origin (henning
et al., 2002a) and for artificial cells of neuronal and glial
origin (henning et al., 2002b). in these systems, the active
transport was saturable as well as energy and temperature
dependent. our group has demonstrated that in hippocampal
neuronal ht22 cells, the drug concentrations are also
reduced in the media in the same rank order (norcloz>
cloz>cloz-n-oxide; heiser et al., 2003), suggesting that
this mechanism might be also valid for shs5y5 cells but
not for primary rat cortical cells. additionally, our experiments showed cloz-induced changes in the main metabolizing enzyme of cloz, cyp1a2, in hippocampal neuronal
ht22 cells (heiser et al., 2003). although not examined,

301

this enzyme is also present in shs5y5 cells. overall, these
results strongly suggest that cloz is metabolized in neuronal
and glial cells including shs5y5 cells and leads to respective changes in  xxxg1113xxx  parameters.
compared with dopamine d2 receptors, the affinity of
cloz to human cloned 5-ht2a receptors is about 17-fold
higher (seeman, 2002), suggesting an important function of
this effect in the actions of the atypical neuroleptic in
contrast to the classical neuroleptics with a preferential
d2 affinity. this has also been demonstrated in clinical
studies, revealing an occupancy of the  xxxg1113xxx  in
cloz-treated patients with schizophrenia of 89% compared
with a  xxxg656xxx  occupancy of 47% (farde et al., 1994).
moreover, the binding of a selective ligand to the 5-ht2a
receptor (135i-5-i-r91150) is significantly lower in cloztreated schizophrenic patients than in healthy controls as
demonstrated in a spect imaging protocol using the
cortex/cerebellum ratio (travis et al., 1998). lundberg
et al. (1996) could also show a high affinity of cloz to
the 5-ht2 receptors in the human frontal cortical region of
healthy volunteers using a pet study design. similar
results could be obtained by investigating postmortem
human brains (hall et al., 1995).
according to with our data, it is indeed likely that a
treatment with cloz will not only affect the affinity of the 5ht2 system but also lead to changes on the transcriptional
level in the brain.

5. conclusions
taken together, the results of the present study showed
that cloz and its metabolites induce significant alterations
on the  xxxg1113xxx  in primary cortical cells of the rat and
in human hippocampal cells, extending the in vivo results
including the human studies in patients with schizophrenia.
thus, the in vitro systems are useful to further characterize
the pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effects of
cloz and its metabolites on  xxxg1113xxx  parameters in
the brain.
