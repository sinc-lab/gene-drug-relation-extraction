voltage-dependent ion channels control electrical activity
in the human heart. the activation of voltage-dependent na⫹
and ca2⫹ channels leads to excitation and contraction of the
myocardium, whereas repolarization is largely controlled by
the activity of voltage-dependent k⫹ channels. several voltage-dependent k⫹ channels exist in the human myocardium.
the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) encodes the
k⫹ channel that carries the rapid component of the delayed
rectifier current (ikr) in the human heart (sanguinetti et al.,
1995; trudeau et al., 1995). herg channel activity contributes to cardiac repolarization and is an important determinant of the qt interval on the electrocardiogram (ecg).
mutations in herg leading to a reduction in its activity are

vation parameters or on channel inactivation processes.
rpr260243 displayed no activator-like effects on other voltagedependent ion channels, including the closely related  xxxg1248xxx  k⫹
channel. rpr260243 enhanced the delayed rectifier current in
guinea pig myocytes but, when administered alone, had little
effect on action potential parameters in these cells. however,
rpr260243 completely reversed the action potential-prolonging
effects of dofetilide in this preparation. using the langendorff
heart method, we found that 5 ␮m rpr260243 increased t-wave
amplitude, prolonged the pr interval, and shortened the qt interval. we believe rpr260243 represents the first known herg
channel activator and that the drug works primarily by inhibiting
channel closure, leading to a persistent herg channel current
upon repolarization. compounds like rpr260243 will be useful for
studying the physiological role of herg and may one day find use
in treating cardiac disease.

responsible for the type 2 form of congenital long qt syndrome (curran et al., 1995) and can lead to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.
it is now well established that many drugs can specifically
block the herg channel, leading to a condition known as
acquired long qt syndrome. in this case, drugs, usually as a
side effect, inhibit herg, leading to qt prolongation on the
ecg and to the development of the life-threatening ventricular
arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes. indeed, a staggering
array of drugs including antihistamines, antibiotics, and antipsychotics are known to produce acquired long qt syndrome
via a specific inhibition of herg (pearlstein et al., 2003; redfern et al., 2003). despite extensive pharmacological study, no
activators of herg have yet been documented. the present
report describes the in vitro electrophysiological effects of the
first herg channel activator, rpr260243.

abstract
many drugs inhibit the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg)
cardiac k⫹ channel. this leads to action potential prolongation on
the cellular level, a prolongation of the qt interval on the electrocardiogram, and sometimes cardiac arrhythmia. to date, no activators of this channel have been reported. here, we describe the
in vitro electrophysiological effects of (3r,4r)-4-[3-(6-methoxyquinolin-4-yl)-3-oxo-propyl]-1-[3-(2,3,5-trifluoro-phenyl)-prop-2ynyl]-piperidine-3-carboxylic acid (rpr260243), a novel activator
of herg. using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that
rpr260243 dramatically slowed current deactivation when applied to cells stably expressing herg. the effects of rpr260243
on herg channel deactivation were temperature- and voltagedependent and occurred over the concentration range of 1 to 30
␮m. rpr260243-modified herg currents were inhibited by
dofetilide (ic50 ⫽ 58 nm). rpr260243 had little effect on herg
current amplitude and no significant effects on steady-state acti-

cell culture and isolation. chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells
(american type culture collection, manassas, va) were stably
transfected with the cdna encoding the herg cardiac k⫹ channel
as described previously (rampe et al., 1997). cells were grown in
ham’s f-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
500 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) in an atmosphere of 95%
air/5% co2.  xxxg1268xxx  and mink were cloned from human heart and
stably expressed in cho cells as described previously (kang et al.,
2000). the cdna encoding  xxxg2028xxx , the human na⫹ channel, was
stably transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (american
type culture collection) as described previously (kuryshev et al.,
2000). the cdna encoding the  xxxg1248xxx  human brain k⫹ channel was
transiently transfected into cho cells using lipofectamine plus
reagent kit (invitrogen) as reported previously (kang et al., 2001).
single ventricular myocytes were isolated from guinea pigs and
were used to record action potentials, ikr, and ca2⫹ channel currents. single ventricular myocytes were isolated from guinea pigs
using a method modified from that described by salata et al. (1995).
in brief, male guinea pigs (hartley) were anesthetized with 5%
isoflurane (baxter healthcare corporation, deerfield, il) in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (1:1). then a thoracotomy was
performed, and the heart was removed and immediately transferred
to oxygenated (100% o2) cold saline. the heart was perfused retrogradely  xxxd1891xxx  ml/min through the aorta with an oxygenated ca2⫹-

free saline at 37°c in three stages: first with standard ca2⫹-free
saline for 5 min, then with the same solution containing 280 u/ml
type ii collagenase (worthington biochemicals, freehold, nj) plus
0.75 u/ml type xiv protease (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) for 8
min, and finally with saline containing 0.2 mm cacl2 for an additional 7 min. the left ventricle was cut into small pieces and was
gently shaken at room temperature for approximately 5 min to
disperse single myocytes. the isolated myocytes were then maintained  xxxd1891xxx °c for electrophysiological recording within 4 to 5 h after
isolation.
patch-clamp recording. all ionic currents were recorded using
the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (hamill et
al., 1981). electrodes (2–4 m⍀ resistance) were made from tw150f
glass capillary tubes (wpi, sarasota, fl). for all k⫹ channel recordings, electrodes were filled with the following solution: 120 mm
potassium aspartate, 20 mm kcl, 4 mm na2atp, 5 mm hepes, and
1 mm mgcl2, ph 7.2, with koh. the external solution contained 130
mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 2.8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm
hepes, 10 mm glucose, and 1 mm cacl2, ph 7.4, with naoh. the
internal and external solutions for na⫹ and ca2⫹ channel recordings
have been described previously (kang et al., 2004). all ionic currents
were recorded using an axopatch 200b amplifier (axon instruments
inc., union city, ca). spontaneous rundown of herg currents
averaged approximately 10% over the course of 10-min recording.
currents were analyzed using the pclamp suite of software (axon

and 0.05 mm na2 edta. the hearts were paced at 3 hz via a pair of
bipolar electrodes on the right atrium at a site close to the sinoatrial
node using a 1-ms pulse that was 20% above the threshold voltage.
ecg waveforms were recorded and analyzed using silver chloride
electrodes, as described by zabel et al. (1995), and an ecg amplifier
and recording software (buxco electronics, wilmington, nc). the
hearts were set up and allowed to equilibrate for 2 to 3 h before
testing. control ecg tracings were then recorded for 20 min followed
by perfusion of the heart with rpr260243 for an additional 20 min.
five ecg waveforms were analyzed for pr interval, qrs duration,
qt interval, and t-wave amplitude at 5-min intervals. the data
were then averaged and expressed as the mean ⫾ s.e.m., and
statistical comparisons were made using a paired student’s t test
with p values of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.

during the course of screening compounds for herg channel-blocking activity, we came across a compound known as
rpr260243 that displayed peculiar effects on herg channel
currents. figure 1 illustrates these effects in cho cells stably transfected with herg. cells were held at ⫺80 mv, and

and b, respectively. the peak tail currents upon return to ⫺80 mv were
normalized to the last pulse in the absence of drug and are plotted in fig.

respectively (n ⫽ 5; r2 ⫽ 0.99). after the addition of 10 ␮m
rpr260243, tail current decay was slowed, with ␶f and ␶s
measuring 637 ⫾ 122 and 12,706 ⫾ 1513 ms, respectively
(n ⫽ 5; r2 ⫽ 0.96). indeed, it took approximately 2 min for the
currents to return to the prepulse holding potential. examples of the fits to the tail currents are illustrated in fig. 1c.
the effect of rpr260243 on herg channel deactivation was
voltage-dependent. the slow time constants observed in the
tail currents after exposure to 10 ␮m rpr260243 measured
5638 ⫾ 909 and 2402 ⫾ 298 ms when cells were returned to
⫺100 and ⫺120 mv, respectively (n ⫽ 4). the slow time
constants in the presence of drug are plotted as a function of
voltage in fig. 1c (inset). because increasing temperature
greatly speeds both activation and deactivation of herg, we
repeated the experiment described for fig. 1b at 37°c (fig.
1d). as was the case for the room-temperature recordings,
current amplitude measured at the end of the ⫹20 mv depolarizing pulse was not significantly altered in the presence of
the drug and measured 11 ⫾ 9% higher than the predrug
value (p ⬎ 0.05, paired t test). in the absence of drug, herg
tails currents measured at ⫺80 mv were fit to a biexponential function. ␶f and ␶s measured 28 ⫾ 2 and 107 ⫾ 4 ms,
respectively (n ⫽ 6; r2 ⫽ 0.98). after the addition of 10 ␮m
rpr260243, tail current decay was again dramatically
slowed, although not to the extent observed at room temperature. tail currents in the presence of rpr260243 decayed
with a fast time constant measuring 207 ⫾ 58 ms and a slow
time constant measuring 2176 ⫾ 169 ms (n ⫽ 6; r2 ⫽ 0.95).
tail currents took approximately 5 s to fully decay.
figure 2 shows the concentration-response relationship for
rpr260243 on herg. cells were held at ⫺80 mv, and 2-s
depolarizations to ⫹20 mv were applied every 30 s followed
by repolarization of the cells to ⫺50 mv. currents were
recorded at room temperature. immediately after the ⫺50
mv step, the cells were hyperpolarized to ⫺120 mv for 10 s.
figure 2a illustrates the effects of rpr260243 on these
herg currents. the most obvious effect of the drug was to
produce a slowing of current deactivation. this effect is illustrated by plotting the slow time constants of deactivation
measured at ⫺120 mv as a function of drug concentration
(fig. 2b). drug effects were observed over the concentration
range of 1 to 30 ␮m.
to further ensure that the currents evoked by rpr260243
were carried through herg, we explored the interaction of
the potent and selective herg channel antagonist dofetilide
with rpr260243. using the pulse protocol used in fig. 2, we
stimulated the herg channel with 10 ␮m rpr260243 (fig.
3a). as expected, this treatment resulted in the removal of
current deactivation at ⫺50 mv along with a slight increase
in tail current amplitude. these rpr260243-stimulated tail
currents were inhibited by dofetilide in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 3b). the ic50 values for dofetilide inhibition of
rpr260243-modified currents measured 58 nm (34 –98 nm,
95% confidence limits). this value was somewhat higher
than the 11 nm ic50 value that we have reported previously
for dofetilide inhibition of herg (kang et al., 2004). although dofetilide abolished current through these channels,
it did not reverse the effects of rpr260243 on tail current
decay.
from the data in fig. 1d, it seemed that rpr260243
slowed the time to peak current upon depolarization from
⫺80 to ⫹20 mv. to examine this further, we conducted an

repolarization to ⫺50 mv to produce large, slowly deactivating tail currents characteristic of herg (sanguinetti et al.,
1995). the pulses were delivered at 30-s intervals. upon
addition of rpr260243 (10 ␮m), herg tail currents failed to
decay, and a large persistent current developed, making further recordings difficult (fig. 1a). this response was completely reversible upon washing the cell with drug-free solution for several minutes. figure 1b illustrates the
mechanism underlying these findings. in these experiments,
cells were held at ⫺80 mv and depolarized to ⫹20 mv for 2 s.
the cells were then returned to ⫺80 mv, and the tail currents were observed for approximately 40 s. once control
currents were recorded, 10 ␮m rpr260243 was added to the
cells for 3 min without pulsing. we observed no increase in
the holding current during this time. after the drug had
washed in, we delivered one more depolarizing step. we
found that rpr260243 had no significant effect on the initial
current amplitude recorded at ⫹20 mv. currents measured
at the end of the ⫹20-mv depolarizing pulses were increased
by an average of 15 ⫾ 9% after exposure to 10 ␮m
rpr260243 (p ⬎ 0.05, paired t test; n ⫽ 5). however, a
consistent and dramatic slowing of current deactivation at
⫺80 mv was observed. under control conditions, tail current
decay was fit to a biexponential function. fast and slow time
constants (␶f and ␶s) measured 129 ⫾ 15 and 534 ⫾ 60 ms,

manner similar to that described previously for herg
(smith et al., 1996; spector et al., 1996; walker et al., 1999).
to assess the effects of rpr260243 on recovery from inactivation, cells were depolarized to ⫹30 mv for 500 ms at room
temperature. cells were then returned to ⫺100, ⫺90, or ⫺80
mv for 100 ms to generate inward tail currents. recovery
from inactivation was determined by fitting the initial rising
phase of these tail currents, before deactivation occurred, to
a single exponential function. figure 6a shows the tail currents obtained in the presence and absence of 10 ␮m
rpr260243. figure 6b plots the time constants measured in
these experiments in the presence and absence of drug.
rpr260243 produced no significant effect on the rate of
recovery from inactivation at these potentials (p ⬎ 0.05,
paired t test). to examine the voltage dependence of inactivation, cells were depolarized for 1 s to ⫹30 mv. this was
followed by 20-ms pulses to potentials between ⫺110 and
⫹30 mv followed by a second 200-ms step to ⫹30 mv. the
amplitudes of the peak currents elicited by the second step to
⫹30 mv, in the absence and presence of drug, were then
determined. the currents were normalized to the first pulse
obtained in the absence of drug (i.e., after the ⫺110-mv step),
and the v0.5 and k of the curves were calculated. in the
absence of drug, v0.5 and k measured ⫺70 mv (⫺79 to ⫺62
mv, 95% cl) and ⫺25 (⫺29 to ⫺21, 95% cl), respectively.
after the addition of 10 ␮m rpr260243, v0.5 and k measured
⫺69 mv (⫺75 to ⫺62 mv, 95% cl) and ⫺25 (⫺28 to ⫺21,
95% cl), respectively.
figure 7 examines the effects of rpr260243 recorded at
different pulse frequencies. in these experiments cells, were
depolarized for 300 ms to ⫹20 mv from a holding potential of
⫺80 mv at 37°c. thirty such pulses were delivered at 1 hz in
the absence of drug (fig. 7a, inset). after this, rpr260243
was added to the cells for approximately 3 min without
pulsing. after this equilibration period, cell were again stimulated for 30 s at a rate of 1 hz. we found that the effects of

envelope of tails test (trudeau et al., 1995). in this experiment, tail currents were generated at ⫺80 mv after the
application of voltage steps of increasing duration to ⫹20 mv
at a temperature of 37°c. currents in the absence and presence of 10 ␮m rpr260243 are shown in fig. 4, a and b,
respectively. peak tail currents were normalized to the value
obtained for the last pulse under control conditions. these
normalized values were then fitted with a single exponential
and are plotted in fig. 4c. the time constant measured in the
absence of drug measured 60 ms (49 –70 ms, 95% cl). this
value was increased to 91 ms (75–107 ms, 95% cl) in the
presence of 10 ␮m rpr260243.
we next examined the effects of rpr260243 over a wide
range of test potentials. in these experiments, cells were held at
⫺80 mv, and currents were elicited by 2-s depolarizing pulses
to potentials ranging from ⫺50 to ⫹30 mv in 10-mv increments. the membrane potential was then returned to ⫺80 mv,
and the peak tail currents were measured and used to construct
steady-state activation curves. these experiments were carried
out at 37°c. current traces in the absence and presence of 10
␮m rpr260243 are shown in fig. 5, a and b, respectively.
rpr260243 produced long-lasting tail currents upon repolarization of the cells to ⫺80 mv. otherwise, the drug produced
only minor effects on the current waveforms, including a small
slowing of activation, especially at more depolarized potentials,
and an approximately 10 to 20% increase in current amplitude
when measured at the end of the depolarizing step (fig. 5c).
the drug did not significantly alter the steady-state activation
curve generated from the peak tail currents. under control
conditions, the midpoint (v0.5) and the slope (k) of the curve
measured ⫺28 mv (⫺30 to ⫺27 mv, 95% cl) and 8.0 (6.8 –9.2,
95% cl), respectively. after the addition of 10 ␮m rpr260243,
v0.5 and k measured ⫺27 mv (⫺29 to ⫺24 mv, 95% cl) and 9.3
(7.1–11.5, 95% cl), respectively.

both the rising time of the current and current deactivation
were slowed in the presence of the drug compared with control. all 30 traces obtained at a 1-hz frequency in the presence of drug are shown in fig. 7b. in addition to this pulse
train, we also examined the effects of the drug at stimulation
frequencies of 0.5 and 0.1 hz. currents obtained at these
frequencies are shown for comparison in fig. 7, c and d. we
observed no differences in the effects of the drug at these
various stimulation rates, with the exception of the fact that
the 0.1-hz rate was sufficiently slow to allow for channel
closure between pulses.
we also studied the effects rpr260243 on other voltagedependent ion channels. figure 8 shows the effects of

rpr260243 on the human cardiac na⫹ channel, the  xxxg1268xxx /mink cardiac k⫹ channel, the l-type ca2⫹ channel
recorded from guinea pig myocytes, and the human brain k⫹
channel  xxxg1248xxx . rpr260243 had no significant effects on the
human cardiac na⫹ channel or on  xxxg1268xxx /mink at concentrations up to 30 ␮m (fig. 8, a and b). rpr260243 was a
weak inhibitor of the l-type ca2⫹ channel, producing 10 ⫾ 3
and 30 ⫾ 6% inhibition  xxxd1891xxx  and 30 ␮m, respectively (fig.
8c; n ⫽ 5– 6). unlike its effects on herg, rpr260243 failed
to demonstrate any agonist-like effects on the  xxxg1248xxx  k⫹ channel, despite the fact that  xxxg1248xxx  is in the same family as herg
(warmke and ganetzky, 1994). in fact, rpr260243 was an
antagonist of  xxxg1248xxx , inhibiting peak tail currents measured at
⫺100 mv by 42 ⫾ 8 and 68 ⫾ 5% at concentrations 10 and 30
␮m, respectively (fig. 8d; n ⫽ 6).
figure 9 shows the effects of rpr260243 on ikr and action
potentials recorded from guinea pig myocytes. to record ikr,
myocytes were held at ⫺50 mv and depolarized every 5 s for
300 ms to ⫹10 mv. the cells were then returned to ⫺50 mv,
and outward tail currents were recorded. the experiments
were conducted at 37°c and used the same external and
internal solutions used for the cloned herg channel studies.
as was the case with the cloned herg channel, ikr deactivation was slowed by the addition of 10 and 30 ␮m
rpr260243, resulting in a nondeactivating current under
these conditions (fig. 9a). this effect was completely abolished when 1 ␮m dofetilide was further added to the cells
(fig. 9a). peak dofetilide-sensitive tail currents measured
46 ⫾ 6 pa under control conditions and 78 ⫾ 9 and 95 ⫾ 11
pa after the addition of 10 and 30 ␮m rpr260243, respectively. to record action potentials, myocytes were stimulated
at a rate of 1 hz, and the resting membrane potential (rmp),
action potential amplitude (apa), and the action potential
duration at 50% and 90% repolarization (apd50 and apd90,
respectively) were recorded. typical action potential recordings in the absence and presence of rpr260243 are shown in
fig. 9b. rpr260243 (1–30 ␮m) had no effect on rmp or apa.
rpr260243 at concentrations up to 10 ␮m also had no significant effect on apd50 or adp90. only at 30 ␮m did
rpr260243 change action potential duration, shortening
both apd50 and apd90 by 12 ⫾ 3% (p ⬍ 0.05, paired t test;
n ⫽ 6). however, the effects of rpr260243 on action potential
duration were more pronounced in the presence of dofetilide.
apd90 was increased by 23 ⫾ 5% (n ⫽ 6) by the addition of 10
nm dofetilide. this prolongation in apd90 was reversed in a
dose-dependent manner with the addition of rpr260243
(3–30 ␮m; fig. 9, c and d). similar results were obtained for
apd50 (data not shown).
we also examined the effects of rpr260243 on the ecg
waveform measured in guinea pig hearts in vitro using the
langendorff method. the hearts were allowed to stabilize for
2 to 3 h after which time control ecg traces were recorded
for 20 min. rpr260243 (5 ␮m) was then added to the perfusate, and ecgs were recorded for an additional 20 min.
rpr260243 had multiple effects on the ecg waveform. most
prominent was a large increase in t-wave amplitude that
began immediately after drug exposure and continued
throughout the recording time. compared with control tracings, t-wave amplitude increased by a maximum of 82 ⫹ 24%
(n ⫽ 6) after the addition of rpr260243 (fig. 10a). qrs
duration was unaffected by the drug (fig. 10b). other
changes in the ecg waveform included an 11 ⫾ 3% prolon-

gation in the pr interval (fig. 10c) and a 6 ⫾ 1% reduction
in the qt interval (fig. 10d). because some of these effects
are similar to those produced by elevated extracellular k⫹

levels, we examined the effects of increased levels of extracellular k⫹ on the ecg recordings. when extracellular k⫹

as a rule, small-molecule activators of voltage-dependent
ion channels are rare. for example, despite decades of intensive pharmacological study of cardiac na⫹ and ca2⫹ channels, only a handful of activators of these proteins are known
to exist. drugs that activate voltage-dependent ion channels
can work through many different mechanisms. for example,
by promoting long-lasting channel openings, certain dihydropyridines and benzoylpyrroles enhance l-type ca2⫹ channel
currents and prolong tail current decay (lacerda and brown,
1989; rampe et al., 1993). piperazine derivatives typified by
dpi 201–106 effectively enhance na⫹ currents by removing
channel inactivation (nilius et al., 1987). all of these compounds display marked effects on cardiac function and have
been valuable tools for exploring the contribution of these
channels to cardiac physiology. like cardiac na⫹ and ca2⫹
channels, the pharmacology of the herg cardiac k⫹ channel
is the subject of intense study. inhibition of the herg channel leads to prolongation of the action potential duration, qt
interval prolongation, and the development of torsades de
pointes ventricular arrhythmia. it is now clear that a wide
variety of drugs from numerous structural and pharmacological classes act as antagonists of the channel (pearlstein et
al., 2003; redfern et al., 2003). although many antagonists of
herg are known, to date, no activators of this channel have

been reported. the present study describes some of the in
vitro electrophysiological effects of what we believe to be the
first known activator of herg, rpr260243.
the most obvious effect of rpr260243 that we observed on
herg channel currents was a dramatic slowing of deactivation. this effect was voltage- and temperature-dependent,
being less pronounced at more hyperpolarized potentials or
at elevated temperature. even so, tail currents required
many seconds to completely decay even at ⫺120 mv (room
temperature) or at ⫺80 mv at physiological temperature.
the drug also produced a slowly rising current component
upon depolarization that was evident by the change in the
slope in the envelope of tails test. this test and the “first
pulse” effect observed in fig. 7 suggest that the drug accesses
the herg channel quickly upon depolarization. some increase in herg current amplitude could be seen in the
presence of drug, but this effect was small (10 –20% increase)
and not consistently observed. once herg currents were
modified by the addition of rpr260243, they could be blocked
by nanomolar concentrations of dofetilide. rpr260243 had
no significant effect on steady-state activation or on the recovery from inactivation or the voltage-dependence of inactivation. in terms of specificity, rpr260243 displayed no activator-like properties on a variety of other voltage-dependent
ion channels, including the closely related  xxxg1248xxx  k⫹ channel.
taken together, these results suggest that rpr260243 is an
activator of the herg cardiac k⫹ channel and that the drug
seems to work mainly by slowing closure of the herg channel once it has opened. however, we do not exclude additional
mechanisms of action and believe that more studies, includ-

pharmacological activation of herg

the amplitude of the t wave. this was accompanied by some
shortening of the qt interval and a small prolongation in pr
interval. the changes observed in the t-wave amplitude and
the qt interval suggest that the drug can modify repolarization in the intact heart. because some of these ecg findings
are similar to those observed under conditions of high extracellular k⫹, we compared the effects of rpr260243 to those
produced by 10 mm extracellular k⫹ in this preparation.
elevated k⫹ is known to enhance the activity of herg by
reducing channel inactivation and/or relieving channel block
by extracellular na⫹ (wang et al., 1996; mullins et al., 2002).
administration of 10 mm k⫹ to the hearts also produced an
increase in t-wave amplitude but to a lesser extent than that
seen with rpr260243. elevated k⫹ shortened the qt interval to a lesser extent and prolonged the pr interval to a
greater extent than did the administration of rpr260243.
unlike rpr260243, extracellular k⫹ also significantly prolonged the qrs duration. we believe that rpr260243 administration more specifically highlights the effects of ikr
activation on the ecg, whereas the effects of elevated extracellular k⫹ represent not only an enhancement of ikr, but
also multiple other effects including membrane depolarization. it is interesting that increasing serum k⫹ levels has
been shown to improve repolarization parameters in patients
who suffer from congenital long qt syndrome caused by
herg mutations (compton et al., 1996; etheridge et al.,
2003). provided that at least some functional herg chan-

ing single-channel analyses, are necessary to fully explore all
the molecular properties of this new and unique class of drug.
in addition to its effects on the cloned herg channel, we
also examined the actions of rpr260243 on native ikr and on
action potentials, both recorded from guinea pig myocytes.
like its effects on the cloned herg channel, rpr260243
slowed deactivation of ikr, producing a persistent outward
current component. rpr260243 alone had only modest effects on action potential parameters. the only significant
effect we observed was a small shortening of action potential
duration at the highest concentration tested (30 ␮m). because multiple ionic currents contribute to the action potential in these cells, it is possible that the particular actions of
rpr260243 on ikr are, by themselves, insufficient to dramatically alter the action potential waveform. however, the effects of rpr260243 were more pronounced when it was administered in addition to the ikr-blocker dofetilide. in this
case, the 23% prolongation observed with dofetilide treatment alone was completely reversed, in a dose-dependent
manner, by further additions of rpr260243 (3–30 ␮m).
these results suggest that pharmacological activation of
herg/ikr may be a useful mechanism for reversing the
acquired long qt syndrome that is a side effect of certain
medications.
we used the langendorff heart method to examine the
effects of rpr260243 on the ecg waveform in the intact
heart. the most pronounced effect of the drug was to enhance

nels are present, it is possible that herg agonists could one
day be used to treat congenital long qt syndrome via a
specific modulation of herg. drugs such as rpr260243 may
be especially useful in those patients in whom specific herg
mutations result in accelerated channel deactivation (chen
et al., 1999).
in summary, rpr260243 is a prototype for a new class of
compounds, herg channel agonists. we believe that
rpr260243 will be a valuable new tool for studying the structural, biophysical, and physiological properties of the herg
cardiac k⫹ channel. the drug seems to slow the open-to-close
transition of the channel, resulting in dramatically prolonged
tail currents during repolarization. in cardiac myocytes,
rpr260243 can reverse the effects of dofetilide on the action
potential. in the intact heart, the drug shortens the qt interval
and enhances t-wave amplitude on the ecg. it is therefore
possible that herg channel activators could also someday find
use in the treatment of repolarization disorders in the heart,
including acquired long qt syndrome, congenital long qt syndrome, and heart failure.
