abstract
lf 16-0687 ž1-ww2,4-dichloro-3-wwž2,4-dimethylquinolin-8-yl.oxyx methylxphenylxsulfonylx-n-w3-ww4-žaminoiminomethyl.phenylx carbonylaminoxpropylx-2ž s .-pyrrolidinecarboxamide. has been selected from a large-scale medicinal chemistry
program for further development. in competition binding studies using w3 hxbradykinin žbk., lf 16-0687 bound to the
human, rat and guinea-pig recombinant b 2 receptor expressed in cho cells giving k i values of 0.67 nm, 1.74 nm and 1.37
nm, respectively. it also bound to the native bk b 2 receptor from human umbilical vein žhuv., rat uterus žru. and
guinea-pig ileum žgpi. giving k i values of 0.89 nm, 0.28 nm and 0.98 nm, respectively. it inhibited bk-induced ip1, ip2
and ip3 formation in int407 cells yielding p k b values of 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7, respectively. in isolated organs experiments, lf
16-0687 behaved as a competitive antagonist of bk-mediated contractions giving p a 2 values of 9.1 in huv, 7.7 in ru and
9.1 in gpi. binding and functional studies performed over 40 different receptors revealed that lf 16-0687 was selective for
the bk b 2 receptor. a continuous intravenous infusion of lf 16-0687 antagonized in a dose-dependent manner and with a
rapid onset of action bk-induced hypotensive response. subcutaneous administration of lf 16-0687 at 1.1 mmolrkg to rats
markedly reduced bk-induced edema of the stomach žy69%., duodenum žy65%. and pancreas žy56%.. q 1999 elsevier

different components of ips were separated and
measured as previously described žpaquet et al.,
1999..
2.2. isolated organs experiments
human umbilical vein žhuv., rat uterus žru.
and gpi were isolated, prepared and set up in organ
baths as previously reported in detail žpruneau et al.,
1995, 1998a, 1999; paquet et al., 1999.. lf 16-0687
or its respective vehicle was added at various concentrations 15 min before cumulative addition of
bk.
2.3. in õiõo experiments
effects of lf 16-0687 against bk-induced hypotensive response was evaluated in anesthetized rats
according to the previously described method
žpruneau et al., 1999..
male sprague–dawley rats ž80–100 g. were used
for bk-induced edema experiments. catheters were

implanted in both right and left jugular veins for
evans blue dye injection and bk infusion, respectively. evans blue dye ž20 mgrkg. was injected as a
bolus and 5 min later bk ž0.56 nmolrkgrmin. was
infused for 20 min. lf 16-0687 ž1.1 mmolrkg. or its
vehicle žsaline. were given subcutaneously 60 min
before starting bk infusion. at the end of bk infusion, 40 ml of saline was infused through the ascending aorta and the animals were sacrificed. the whole
stomach, duodenum and pancreas were then dissected out, carefully dried up, weighed and desiccated for 16 h in a vacuum oven at 608c, weighed
again and incubated in formaldehyde for 24 h at
558c. the evans blue dye content of tissues was
calculated from a standard calibration spectrophotometric curve.

we have successfully established cell lines stably
expressing the human, rat and guinea-pig b 2 receptor which bound w3 hxbk giving k d values of 0.64
" 0.08 nm ž n s 9., 0.46 " 0.09 nm ž n s 6. and
0.09 " 0.04 nm ž n s 4., and bmax of 2283 " 325,
2265 " 526 and 1492 " 301 fmolrmg protein, respectively. in corresponding cell membrane preparations, lf 16-0687 competed with w3 hxbk giving
calculated k i values of 0.67 " 022 nm ž n s 4.,
1.74 " 0.68 nm ž n s 3. and 1.37 " 0.32 nm ž n s 4.
for the recombinant human, rat and guinea-pig b 2
receptor, respectively žsee fig. 2..
binding characteristics of w3 hxbk to membrane
preparations of huv, ru and gpi have been described in details žpruneau et al., 1998a, 1999.. lf
16-0687 inhibited the binding of w3 hxbk giving k i

selectivity of lf 16-0687 was further assessed by
testing in 40 receptor binding, two enzyme and eight
ion channel assays. lf 16-0687 at 1 mm had no
significant effect in this battery of assays, except for
the human muscarinic m 2 and m 1 receptor binding
assay in which it had an ic 50 of 0.30 mm and 0.46
mm, respectively.
3.3. functional assays
bk increased in a concentration-dependent manner the production of ips in int407 cells žfig. 3..

lf 16-0687 at 100 nm markedly shifted to the right
response-curves to bk without significantly affecting the maximum. calculated p k b values of lf
16-0687 were 8.5 " 0.1 ž n s 3., 8.6 " 0.1 ž n s 3.

respectively. schild plot slopes were not different
from unity.
in the anesthetized rat, bk produced a short-lasting decrease of arterial blood pressure. a continuous
intravenous infusion of lf 16-0687 antagonized in a
dose-dependent manner the hypotensive response to

bk žfig. 5.. interestingly, the maximum inhibitory
effect was obtained 5 min after the beginning of

4. discussion
in the present study, we have shown that lf
16-0687 is one of the most potent non-peptide antagonist of the human b 2 receptor so far described. this
compound did not bind to the b 1 receptor or to a
range of other g-protein coupled receptors, with the
exception of muscarinic m 2 and m 1 receptors for
which a moderate binding affinity of lf 16-0687

was noted. we also showed that the compound
antagonized bk-mediated responses in vivo.
kinins are active fragments produced by enzymatic cleavage of large precursors, kininogens, which
are circulating proteins activated in a number of
pathophysiological situations. in this respect, kinins
are considered as important mediators of inflammation žbhoola et al., 1992; hall, 1992.. most of the
acute proinflammatory effects of kinins including
vasodilatation, increase of vascular permeability, activation and sensitization of primary afferent c- and
ad-fibers are mediated by b 2 receptors žfor review,
see bhoola et al., 1992; dray and bevan, 1993;
walker et al., 1995.. this may explain the outstanding efforts made to discover potent and selective b 2
receptor antagonists. in this regard, hoe 140 žd-argwhyp 3, thi 5, d-tic 7, oic 8 x-bk. has long been considered as the gold-standard b 2 receptor antagonist.
recently, the pharmacological profile of novel potent
non-peptide b 2 receptor antagonists, fr173657
žaramori et al., 1997; asano et al., 1997., fr167344
žaramori et al., 1997; inamura et al., 1997. and
fr165649 žasano et al., 1998. was disclosed.
fr167344 was described as an orally active and
long-acting b 2 receptor antagonist žinamura et al.,
1997..
bk dilates the cerebral vasculature in an endothelium-dependent manner žsobey et al., 1997. and
opens the blood brain barrier žbbb. žwahl et al.,

experiments.

1993.. in addition, all the components of the
kallikrein–kinin system have been identified in the
brain žwalker et al., 1995. and b 2 receptors appear
widely distributed in neurons from specific brain
areas, as well as in astrocytes žhosli
¨ and hosli,
¨
1993; raidoo and bhoola, 1997.. targeting cerebral
edema secondary to traumatic brain injury žtbi. as a
potential therapeutic application, we have been
searching for novel non-peptide bk b 2 receptor
antagonists. they need to display a high potency and
selectivity for the receptor, exhibit a short onset of
action, be sufficiently soluble for intravenous administration, and potentially able to cross the bbb. the
first prototype compound was lf 16-0335 which had
a k i value of 0.84 nm for the cloned human b 2
receptor and a p a 2 value of 8.3 in the huv contracted by bk and therefore, partially fulfilled the
above-criteria žpruneau et al., 1998a.. in the present
study, we report the pharmacological profile of lf
16-0687 which is approximately nine times more
potent than lf 16-0335 inhibiting functional responses mediated by human and guinea-pig b 2 receptors žpruneau et al., 1998a, 1999..
lf 16-0687 was also independently evaluated for
its effects against brain edema in an animal model of
tbi. in a preliminary account of these results
žpruneau et al., 1998b., we showed that a continuous
infusion of lf 16-0687, starting 1 h after closed
head trauma in rats, reduced by 64% the increase of
water content in the injured hemisphere measured 24
h later. although it is not known yet if lf 16-0687
crossed the bbb, these results, taken together with
those from the literature, favor an important detrimental role of bk in the formation of brain edema
following head injury. additional experimental studies are underway to further evaluate the potential
value of lf 16-0687 as a novel therapeutic approach
of tbi.
