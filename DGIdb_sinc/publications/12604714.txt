abstract
the present study aimed to identify selective  xxxg183xxx  modulators (sarms) with in vivo pharmacological activity.
we examined the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activity of
four chiral, nonsteroidal sarms synthesized in our laboratories.
in the in vitro assays, these compounds demonstrated moderate to high  xxxg183xxx  (ar) binding affinity, with ki
values ranging from 4 to 37 nm, and three of the compounds
efficaciously stimulated ar-mediated reporter gene expression. the compounds were then administered subcutaneously
to castrated rats to appraise their in vivo pharmacological activity. androgenic activity was evaluated by the ability of these
compounds to maintain the weights of prostate and seminal
vesicle, whereas levator ani muscle weight was used as a
measure of anabolic activity. the maximal response (emax) and
dose for half-maximal effect (ed50) were determined for each

endogenous androgens play crucial physiological roles in
establishing and maintaining the male phenotype (george
and wilson, 1986; mooradian et al., 1987). their actions are
essential for the differentiation and growth of male reproductive organs, initiation and regulation of spermatogenesis,
and control of male sexual behavior. in addition, androgens
are important for the development of male characteristics in
certain extragenital structures such as muscle, bone, hair,
larynx, skin, lipid tissue, and kidney (takeda et al., 1990). in
females, the precise physiological roles of androgens are not
completely understood, but the age-related decline in circulating androgen levels has been linked to symptoms such as
decreased libido and sexuality, lack of vigor, diminished well
the in vivo studies reported herein were supported by a grant from gtx,

compound and compared with that observed for testosterone
propionate (tp). compounds s-1 and s-4 demonstrated in vivo
androgenic and anabolic activity, whereas compounds s-2 and
s-3 did not. the activities of s-1 and s-4 were tissue-selective
in that both compounds stimulated the anabolic organs more
than the androgenic organs. these two compounds were less
potent and efficacious than tp in androgenic activity, but their
anabolic activity was similar to or greater than that of tp.
neither s-1 nor s-4 caused significant luteinizing hormone or
follicle stimulating hormone suppression at doses near the
ed50 value. thus, compounds s-1 and s-4 were identified as
sarms with potent and tissue-selective in vivo pharmacological activity, and represent the first members of a new class of
sarms with selective anabolic effects.

synthesized steroidal androgens, due to their ability to
mimic the actions of their endogenous counterparts, have
been used clinically as valuable therapeutic agents to target
a variety of male and female disorders resulting from androgen deficiency. the principle clinical indication of androgens
is as replacement therapy for hypogonadal men (conway et
al., 1988; wu, 1992). other documented clinical uses of androgens include delayed puberty in boys, anemias, primary
osteoporosis, hereditary angioneurotic edema, endometriosis,
 xxxg730xxx -positive breast cancer, and muscular diseases (wu, 1992; bagatell and bremner, 1996; nieschlag,
1996; bhasin and tenover, 1997). also, androgens have been
investigated as hormone replacement therapy for aging men
and for regulation of male fertility (wu, 1992; tenover, 1997).
since the discovery of the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in the 1930s, a variety of androgen preparations have
been introduced and tested clinically. unfortunately, virtu-

ally all currently available androgen preparations have severe limitations (wu, 1992; bhasin and bremner, 1997). unmodified testosterone is impractical for oral administration
due to its low systematic bioavailability (handelsman et al.,
1990). testosterone esters (e.g.,  xxxd3327xxx  and
 xxxd3326xxx ) are presently the most widely used
testosterone preparations, usually administered by intramuscular injection in oil vehicles (snyder and lawrence,
1980; velazquez and bellabarba arata, 1998). a prolonged
duration of action is achievable with these esters. however,
they produce highly variable testosterone levels. 17␣-alkylated testosterones (e.g., methyltestosterone and  xxxd2806xxx ) can be given orally. nevertheless, they often cause
unacceptable hepatotoxicity and are less efficacious; hence,
they are not recommended for long-term androgen therapy
(heywood et al., 1977; ishak and zimmerman, 1987;
velazquez and bellabarba arata, 1998). another common
concern about steroidal androgens is the undesirable effects
resulting from the cross-reactivity of the androgens or their
in vivo metabolites with steroid receptors other than the
 xxxg183xxx  (ar) (wilson et al., 1980; bhasin and
bremner, 1997).
during studies with affinity ligands for the ar, our group
discovered a group of nonsteroidal androgens that are structural derivatives of  xxxd334xxx  and hydroxyflutamide, two
known antiandrogens (dalton et al., 1998; mukherjee et al.,
1999). other laboratories have also reported the identification of nonsteroidal compounds that possess androgen activity (dalton et al., 1998; hamann et al., 1999; negro-vilar,
1999). the discovery of these nonsteroidal androgens offers
an opportunity for the development of a new generation of
selective  xxxg183xxx  modulators (sarms) superior to
current steroidal androgens. theoretically, sarms are advantageous over their steroidal counterparts in that they can
obtain better receptor selectivity and allow greater flexibility
in structural modification. thus, sarms can potentially
avoid the undesirable effects caused by receptor cross-reactivity and achieve superior pharmacokinetic properties.
subsequent to our initial discovery of several nonsteroidal
androgens, our laboratories designed and synthesized multiple series of nonsteroidal compounds, and explored the structure-activity relationships for androgenic and anabolic activities, both in vitro and in vivo (he et al., 2002; yin et al.,
2003a,b). according to results from these structure-activity
relationship studies, we designed a group of novel nonsteroidal compounds (fig. 1) that were structurally optimized. we
report herein the results of our studies to examine the in
vitro ar binding affinity and the androgenic and anabolic
activities of these new compounds in an animal model. two
potent and tissue-selective sarms were identified from
these structurally similar compounds, and they are members
of a promising new class of drug candidates for further development.

materials and methods
materials. the s-isomers of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the
r-isomer of compound 1 were synthesized in our laboratories (synthetic procedures will be reported separately). the purities of these
compounds were greater than 99%, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography.  xxxd3327xxx  (tp),  xxxd2982xxx  300 (peg 300, reagent grade), and  xxxd1896xxx 

(reagent grade) were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo).
 xxxd102xxx  was purchased from aaper alcohol and chemical
(shelbyville, ky). alzet osmotic pumps (model 2002) were purchased
from alza (palo alto, ca).
in vitro pharmacological activity. cytosolic ar was prepared
from ventral prostates of castrated male sprague-dawley rats (about
250 g). the binding affinity of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the ar
preparation was determined and analyzed as described previously
(mukherjee et al., 1996, 1999). the ability of the compounds to
influence ar-mediated transcriptional activation was examined using a cotransfection system, as described previously (yin et al.,
2003a). transcriptional activation was measured using a single concentration (10 nm) of the indicated compound and reported as a
percentage of the transcriptional activation observed for 1 nm dht.
animals. male sprague-dawley rats, weighing 90 to 100 g, were
purchased from harlan bioproducts for science (indianapolis, in).
the animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food
and water available ad libitum. the animal protocol was reviewed
and approved by the institutional laboratory animal care and use
committee of the ohio state university.
study design. animals were randomly distributed into 30
groups, with five rats per group. treatment groups are described in
table 1. one day before the start of drug treatment, animals in
groups 2 through 30 were surgically castrated. after 24 h of recovery,
alzet osmotic pumps (model 2002) prefilled with a designated solution (table 1) were implanted subcutaneously in the scapular region
of castrated animals. drug solutions used to fill the osmotic pumps
were prepared using aseptic techniques. for solutions of nonsteroidal compounds and low-dose (0.1 mg/day or lower) solutions of tp,
drugs were first dissolved in minimal amounts of ethanol and then
diluted to final concentrations with peg 300 (this vehicle is designated as vehicle 1). because higher doses of tp could not be completely solubilized in the above-mentioned vehicle, tp solutions for
0.3, 0.5, and 0.75 mg/day were prepared by dissolving the drug in a
mixture of ethanol and  xxxd1896xxx  and adjusting with peg
300 to the desired final volume (this vehicle was designated as

vehicle 2). due to the limited solubility of tp, two osmotic pumps
were used in each animal to deliver tp at 0.5 and 0.75 mg/day. one
osmotic pump was used in each animal for other groups.
after 14 days of drug treatment, rats were weighed, anesthetized,
and sacrificed. blood samples were collected by venipuncture of the
abdominal aorta. for each animal, a whole blood sample and a serum
sample were used for complete blood count and chemistry profile
analyses, and a portion of the blood was centrifuged to prepare
plasma. plasma samples from selected groups were analyzed for
fsh, lh, gh, ast-sgot, alt-sgpt, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride. plasma samples for these analyses were
collected from a separate group of animals in the case of the tptreated groups, using dose rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mg/day.
the ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver,
kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed; cleared of extraneous tissue; weighed; and placed in vials containing 10% neutral
buffered formalin. preserved tissues were subjected to histopathological analysis. osmotic pumps were removed from animals to check
for correct pump operation.
data analyses. the weights of all organs were normalized to
body weight, and analyzed for any statistically significant differences between groups using single-factor anova with the ␣ value
set a priori at p ⬍ 0.05. the weights of prostates and seminal vesicles
were used as indices for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the
levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.
statistical analyses of parameters from complete blood count or
serum chemical profiling, wherever applicable, were performed by
single-factor anova with the ␣ value set a priori at p ⬍ 0.05. for
compounds demonstrating full-range dose-response relationships in
any of the measured parameters, the maximal response produced by
the compound (emax) and the dose rate that induced 50% of the
maximal response (ed50) were obtained by nonlinear regression
analysis using winnonlin (version 3.1; pharsight corporation,
mountain view, ca) and the sigmoid emax model. the emax value
indicated the efficacy of each compound, whereas the ed50 indicated
its potency. the relative efficacy of each compound to tp was defined
as the ratio of (emax of the compound) to (emax of tp). the relative
potency was defined as the ratio of (ed50 of tp) to (ed50 of the
compound).

the in vitro ar binding of the r-isomer of compound 1
(designated as r-1) and the s-isomers of compounds 1, 2, 3,
and 4 (designated as s-1, s-2, s-3, and s-4, respectively) was
examined with a radioligand competitive binding assay. r-1
demonstrated poor ar binding affinity (ki ⫽ 225 ⫾ 15 nm),
whereas s-1, s-2, s-3, and s-4 bound to the ar with moderate to high affinity, with ki values ranging from 4 to 37 nm
(fig. 1). next, the ability of these compounds to stimulate
ar-mediated transcription was determined in an in vitro
cotransfection system. at a concentration of 10 nm, compounds s-3 and s-4 stimulated ar-mediated transcription to
75 and 93%, respectively, of that observed for 1 nm dht,
whereas compounds s-1 and s-2 demonstrated lesser stimulation (i.e., 43 and 9.7%, respectively). given previous studies
in our laboratories demonstrating that in vitro cotransfection
models poorly predict in vivo pharmacological activity (yin et
al., 2003a), we then examined the androgenic and anabolic
activities of these nonsteroidal compounds in a castrated rat
model after 14 days of drug administration. r-1 was included
as a negative control. tp, at increasing doses, was used as
the positive control for anabolic and androgenic effects.

prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle in castrated rats were 6.2, 8.1, and 40.9%, respectively, of those in
intact animals. the reduction in masses of these androgentargeted organs in castrated animals is the result of ablation
of endogenous androgen production (saksena and
chaudhury, 1970). exogenous administration of tp, an androgenic and anabolic steroid, increased weights of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle in castrated
rats (fig. 2). the increases in organ weights induced by tp
were dose rate-dependent.
figure 3 shows that  xxxd3553xxx -1 had no significant effect
on prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle in castrated animals at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/day, but significantly stimulated the growth of these organs at higher doses. the
weights of prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle
were maximally restored by s-1 to 14.9, 13.4, and 74.3%,
respectively, of those in intact animals. the ed50 values of
s-1 in prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle, as
obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of dose-response

elevations in organ weights by s-1 demonstrated its androgenic and anabolic activities in animals. in comparison to tp,
corresponding dose rates of s-1 induced significantly smaller
increases in the weight of the prostate and seminal vesicles
but a similar degree of increase in levator ani muscle weight
(compare fig. 2a with 3a). this result denoted the tissue
selective androgenic and anabolic activity of s-1 in rats. the
selectivity was also demonstrated by its relative efficacy compared with tp (table 2). the relative efficacy in maintaining
levator ani muscle weight was 0.72, much higher than the
relative efficacies in maintaining prostate and seminal vesicle weights, which were less than 0.20.
despite their high ar binding affinity, compounds s-2 and
s-3 failed to exert any significant effect on the weights of
prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle in castrated animals, with dose rates up to 1 mg/day (fig. 4). this
suggests that rapid metabolism or clearance of these compounds led to lower plasma concentrations of these drugs,
and thus no pharmacological activity. likewise, compound
r-1 (the stereoisomer of s-1), at 1 mg/day, produced no apparent effect on the weights of prostate, seminal vesicles, and
levator ani muscle in castrated animals, demonstrating the
stereoselective pharmacological action of these compounds.
 xxxd3553xxx -4 (fig. 5) caused dose-dependent stimulation
of growth in prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle, with their weights in castrated animals being maximally
promoted to 33.8, 28.2, and 101% of intact controls, respectively. nonlinear regression analysis of dose-response relationships showed that the ed50 values of s-4 were 0.43 ⫾
0.01, 0.55 ⫾ 0.02, and 0.14 ⫾ 0.01 mg/day in prostate, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle, respectively (fig. 5b;
table 2), corresponding to 1.62, 2.07, and 0.53 mg/kg, respectively, based on the mean body weight of s-4-treated animals
at the end of the study. these results clearly revealed the
androgenic and anabolic activities of s-4 in animals. in particular, s-4 exhibited potent and efficacious anabolic activity,
as indicated by its ability to fully maintain the levator ani
muscle weight in castrated animals at the same level as
intact controls, at a dose rate as low as 0.3 mg/day (fig. 5a).
the relative potency and efficacy of s-4 in androgenic tissues
were less than 0.3 and 0.4, respectively, compared with 1 for
tp, whereas its relative potency and efficacy in the levator
ani muscle was 1.07 and 0.97, respectively, compared with 1
for tp (table 2).
table 2 compares the androgenic and anabolic activities of
s-1 and s-4, two compounds that exhibited in vivo functional
activity in the present study, with those of tp. the efficacy
for androgenic activity of s-4 (as indicated by relative efficacies in prostate and seminal vesicle) was about twice that of
s-1, but the potency for androgenic activity (as indicated by
relative potencies in prostate and seminal vesicle) was similar between these two compounds. as to anabolic activity,
s-4 displayed much higher efficacy (as indicated by relative
efficacy in levator ani muscle) and 2-fold greater potency (as
indicated by relative potency in levator ani muscle) than s-1.
these results suggest the greater selectivity of s-4 toward
the anabolic target organ.
we also determined the serum levels of lh and fsh in
animals that received s-1 and s-4, and compared them with
the levels of these hormones observed in the intact, castrated,
or tp-treated animals. as shown in table 3, castration led to
a significant elevation in fsh and lh levels, compared with

intact animals. tp showed no dose-dependent effect on castration-induced change in fsh, but partially inhibited the
castration-induced increase in lh levels at higher doses. the
activities of s-4 on lh and fsh were similar to those produced by tp. s-1 and s-4 partially suppressed lh production
at dose rates of 0.5 mg/day or higher. however, it is important to note that s-1 and s-4 did not suppress lh production
at the dose levels needed to produce the desired pharmacological effects in the levator ani muscle or prostate. interestingly, s-1 also partially suppressed fsh production at dose
rates of 0.5 mg/day or higher. the fsh suppression noted at
higher doses of s-1 suggested that this compound might
interact with other steroid receptors, most probably progesterone receptors, in addition to the ar. although statistically
significant differences were noted in some instances, gh,
ast-sgot, alt-sgpt, and serum lipids (including cholesterol, high-density liprotein, and triglyceride) were all within
normal ranges for drug-treated animals. no drug- or doserelated changes in these indices were observed.
we also examined the effects of all compounds on total
body weight and the weights of a variety of nonreproductive
organs, including liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and lungs of
treated animals. none of the compounds led to a dose-related
change in these weights (data not shown). to further check

compounds, complete diagnostic hematology studies of compound-treated animals were also performed. no drug- or

manifested no acute toxicity during treatment.

and efficacious nonsteroidal androgens that are structurally
related to antiandrogen pharmacophores (yin et al., 2003a).
however, in vivo studies in a rat model with one of these
nonsteroidal androgens, acetothiolutamide, failed to show
androgenic activity (yin et al., 2003b). subsequent pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies in rats demonstrated that
the lack of in vivo androgenic activity of acetothiolutamide in
the pharmacology study was caused by its insufficient
plasma exposure, which in turn resulted from its extensive
hepatic degradation. also, we found that oxidation at the
sulfur linkage position was one major metabolic pathway for
acetothiolutamide in rats, and that this oxidation likely produced deactivated or even antagonizing metabolites (yin et
al., 2003b). considering these facts, we proposed to modify
the linkage sulfur atom to block the oxidation at this position,
thereby reducing the overall hepatic metabolism. as a result,
a series of novel molecules that carry an ether linkage instead of a thio linkage in the structure were designed and
synthesized. the present studies demonstrated that two of
these ether-bearing molecules, s-1 and s-4, were androgen
receptor modulators with tissue-selective activity in animals.
despite structural similarities, this series of ether-carrying compounds exhibited diverse in vitro and in vivo activity
profiles. the s-isomers of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 displayed
moderate to high binding affinity for the ar, whereas the
r-isomer of compound 1 had poor receptor binding. this
finding was consistent with our previous observation regarding the stereoselective ar binding of nonsteroidal ligands
(mukherjee et al., 1996, 1999). compounds s-1, s-3, and s-4
were further characterized as ar agonists with the in vitro
cotransfection assay. the failure of s-2, a moderate ar
binder, to stimulate ar-mediated gene transcription confirmed our previous finding that high receptor binding affinity is a prerequisite for agonist activity (yin et al., 2003a).
when tested in the castrated rat model, s-1 and s-4 demonstrated potent in vivo functional activity, and compounds s-2
and s-3 were inactive. specifically, s-4 produced the greatest

1339

androgenic and anabolic activity in animals, with anabolic
activity greater than that of tp. s-1 had a similar degree of
anabolic activity as tp, but had much less androgenic activity. interestingly, the ed50 values for s-1 in prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle were approximately the
same (i.e., about 0.4 mg/day), whereas s-4 demonstrated
more than 2-fold greater potency in levator ani muscle compared with prostate and seminal vesicle, as indicated by the
ed50 values (table 2). the distinction in functional activities
in vivo among the four structurally related compounds could
be caused by difference in any of numerous factors, including
intrinsic activity, in vivo disposition and metabolism, or intracellular signaling pathway. further studies to explore the
physicochemical, physiological, and cellular/molecular determinants for nonsteroidal androgenic and anabolic activity
will lead to insights into the mechanism of action of these
nonsteroidal agents, and thereby provide a basis for future
structural optimization.
the in vitro cotransfection assay is generally regarded as a
valuable tool for screening of nonsteroidal ar ligands. with
this assay, compounds s-1, s-3, and s-4 were successfully
identified as potential ar agonists. however, as demonstrated in the animal study, s-3 did not show any measurable
in vivo functional activity. thus, the observation of in vitro
agonist activity in the cotransfection assay can be but is not
always predictive of in vivo activity. the pharmacological
activity in vivo is determined not only by the ability of the
compound to interact with the receptor, but also limited by
complicated factors governing the accessibility of the compound to the effect site, such as disposition and metabolism.
to fully predict the in vivo behavior and understand the
structure-activity relationships, it is necessary to perform
further studies examining the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the compound. as a result of these and other studies,
we abandoned use of the in vitro cotransfection assay in favor
of in vivo pharmacologic assessment for discovery of sarms.
the tissue-selective anabolic activity exhibited by s-1 and
s-4 validated the feasibility of developing sarms as a new
generation of androgens. the possible mechanisms underlying the tissue-selectivity of these agents could be tissuespecific recruitment of cofactors/corepressors during the ar
signaling pathway, or very likely for our nonsteroidal ligands, their distinct in vivo disposition from testosterone and
its ester derivatives. the effects of testosterone in certain
tissues, including most accessory reproductive organs and
skin, are amplified through local conversion to dht, the
more potent bioactive form, by 5␣-reductase (mooradian et
al., 1987). nevertheless, testosterone exerts direct effects in
the testis, skeletal muscles, and bone (mukherjee et al.,
1996). for nonsteroidal ligands, their actions in accessory
reproductive organs such as prostate would not be amplified
as they are for testosterone; therefore, such a nonsteroidal
androgen with equivalent activity to testosterone on bone
and muscle would likely have less activity on prostate or
other accessory reproductive organs than testosterone.
compounds s-1 and s-4 are the first nonsteroidal androgens with in vivo functional activity among our series of
compounds. more significantly, the discovery of these two in
vivo functional drug candidates represents a major progress
toward the development of therapeutically useful sarms.
sarms, like the clinically available selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators, would offer unique therapeutic advantages

1340

yin et al.

over their steroidal counterparts. the tissue selectivity of
these agents offers an exciting opportunity to differentially
regulate the androgen effects in various target tissues, thus
minimizing the interference to normal physiological processes while targeting desirable therapeutic goals. for example, sarms with potent anabolic activity but minimal androgenic activity would be ideal for the treatment of patients
who bear muscular diseases (such as sarcopenia or traumainduced muscle wasting) but are contraindicated for androgenic stimuli (such as for aging population or prostate cancer
patients). in perspective, not only could sarms be used as
superior alternatives to current steroidal androgens in therapy of male hypogonadism but also they could expand the
scope of androgen therapy to include wasting syndromes,
aging-related disorders due to declined androgen levels, male
fertility regulation, and other androgen deficiency-related
diseases.
in summary, the present studies examined the in vitro and
in vivo activity profiles of a series of novel nonsteroidal ar
ligands, among which two were identified as in vivo functional androgens with selective anabolic activity. these
sarms, with many advantages over current steroidal androgen preparations, implicate potential therapeutic significance in a scope of androgen-deficiency related disorders.
continued studies in our laboratories will focus on preclinical
and clinical development of identified sarms and further
optimization of chemical structures based on understanding
the mechanisms underlying nonsteroidal androgenic and anabolic activities.
