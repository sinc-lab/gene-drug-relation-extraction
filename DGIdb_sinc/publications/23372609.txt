abstract: orally active, selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde 5,  xxxd1274xxx 
pde), such as sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are currently the first-choice treatment
options for the clinical management of erectile dysfunction (ed) of various etiologies and
severities. however, a significant number of patients remain dissatisfied with the available
therapies due a lack of efficacy or discomfort arising from adverse events. several new pde5
inhibitors, among which are  xxxd250xxx  ( xxxd250xxx ), lodenafil, mirodenafil,  xxxd3464xxx , slx-2101,
jnj-10280205 and jnj-10287069, have recently been approved and introduced into the
market or are in the final stages of their clinical development.  xxxd250xxx  (marketed in the us
under the brand name stendratm) has been developed by vivus inc. (mountain view, ca,
usa) and has recently received approval from the us food and drug administration (fda)
for use in the treatment of male ed. the drug has demonstrated improved selectivity for
pde5, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a fast onset of action and a plasma
half-life that is comparable to sildenfil and vardenafil. in phase ii and phase iii clinical trials
that included a large number of patients,  xxxd250xxx  has been shown to be effective and well
tolerated. owing to its favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile,  xxxd250xxx  is
considered as a promising new option in the treatment of ed. the present article summarizes
the initial data and clinical key properties of  xxxd250xxx .

introduction
erectile dysfunction (ed), one of the most common sexual disturbances in the adult male, is
defined as a man’s consistent or recurrent inability to attain and/or maintain penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance
[montorsi et al. 2010]. according to epidemiologic studies in this field, such as the massachusetts
male aging study and the cologne male survey,
which surveyed several thousands of males aged
between 30 and 80 years, the overall prevalence of
ed is approximately 20–40% at 40 years of age
and 70% at 70 years [feldman et al. 1994; braun
et al. 2000]. as the proportion of the elderly population is continuously increasing, it has been
estimated that in 2025 an estimated number of
320 million men will be affected by ed, many of
them are expected to seek medical therapy to
treat this condition [aytac et al. 1999]. the discovery of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and  xxxd1274xxx  as

the pivotal signaling molecules in the process of
penile smooth muscle relaxation was a scientific
landmark and has led to the identification of
drugs that are able to elevate intracellular levels of
 xxxd1274xxx , such as the no donor drugs sodium
nitroprusside (snp), nitroglycerine and linsidomine (sin-1). to date, the use of selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5, cyclic
gmp pde), for example, sildenafil, vardenafil
and tadalafil, in the treatment of ed has gained
widespread acceptance in the field of urology and
is considered the first-line strategy to target ed
[kalsi and kell, 2004]. pde5 inhibitors are characterized as nonhydrolyzable analogs to cyclic
gmp that counteract the degradation of this
cyclic nucleotide by competitive binding to the
catalytic site of the pde5, thereby enhancing the
relaxation brought about by no and  xxxd1274xxx 
of penile erectile tissue. the efficacy of sildenafil,
vardenafil and tadalafil has been evaluated in

figure 1. structural formula of  xxxd250xxx . in order
to bind effectively to the catalytic site of the pde5,
a selective inhibitor has to comprise three major
structural principles: a guanine-like base, a riboseor desoxyribose-like system and, finally, a phosphate
diester-like bond. in the  xxxd250xxx  molecule, the
central structure is formed by a nitrogen derivative
of a pyrimidine carboxamide where the nitrogen
atom of the amide is bound to a pyrimidinylmethyl
group. it seems likely that the ribose (sugar)phosphate component is represented by a cyclic
chloromethoxybenzylamino structure; in this case,
the cl-atom and the methoxy ligand resemble the
phosphate group seen in, for example, sildenafil and
vardenafil.

various clinical trials involving a broad spectrum of male subjects with different causes of
ed, including psychogenic ed, as well as
patients with concomitant diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and histories of spinal cord injury
or pelvic surgery (radical cystectomy/prostatectomy). in all trials, men receiving a pde5 inhibitor reported erections sufficient for sexual
intercourse more often than did those who
received placebo; the overall response rates have
been reported at 60–80% [kalsi and kell, 2004].
common adverse events include headache
(10–16%), flushing (5–12%), dyspepsia (4–
12%), nasal congestion (1–10%) and dizziness
(2–3%). in view of the significant number of
patients who remain dissatisfied with the available therapies due to a lack of efficacy or discomfort arising from adverse events, the development
of new pde5 inhibitors with an enhanced selectivity for pde5, a faster onset of action, improved
oral bioavailability and an extended duration of
drug action persists as an important topic and is
being pursued vigorously. currently,  xxxd250xxx 
(originally developed by mitsubishi tanabe
pharma corp., yokohama, japan, under the
substance code  xxxd250xxx ), jnj-10280205, jnj10287069, lodenafil, mirodenafil, slx-2101 and
 xxxd3464xxx  are under development for future use in
the treatment of ed [qiu et al. 2006;
hatzimouratidis and hatzichristou, 2008; eardley
et al. 2010]. some of these drugs have already
entered into the clinical stage of testing ( xxxd250xxx ,

lodenafil and mirodenafil) or have already been
approved in some countries by the drug authorities in charge and are now being offered to
patients ( xxxd3464xxx ). this review focuses on
 xxxd250xxx , a new, highly selective, an orally active
pde5 inhibitor that has recently completed
the final phase of clinical development by
vivus inc. (mountain view, ca, usa).
 xxxd250xxx  has been characterized as a pyrimidine
derivative (chemical name: 4-[(3-chloro-4-methoxybenzyl)amino]-2-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1pyrrolidinyl]-n-(2-pyrimidinylmethyl)-5
-pyrimidinecarboxamide;(s)-2-(2-hydroxymethyl1-pyrrolidinyl)-4-(3-chloro-4-methoxybenzy­
lamino)-5-[(2-pyrimidinylmethyl)carbamoyl]
pyrimidine, molecular weight = 483.95 d) that
exists as a single enantiomer (= one stereoisomer
only with no nonsuperposable mirror image of
itself) with the ability to rotate plane-polarized
light to the left (known as s-stereochemistry).
the chemical structure of  xxxd250xxx  is different
from the standard (nucleo)base/sugar/phosphate
diester model of sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil. therefore,  xxxd250xxx  can bind to the catalytic
site of pde5 independent of the spatial orientation of the molecule. this unique property
may significantly increase the affinity towards
the target enzyme pde5 and, thus, the clinical
efficacy of the drug.
basic research findings
the inhibitory activities of  xxxd250xxx  on various
pde isoenzymes were tested in preclinical studies
and compared with those of sildenafil, vardenafil
and tadalafil.  xxxd250xxx  strongly inhibits pde5 in a
competitive manner; with a half-maximal concentration (ic50) of 5.2 nm, the drug is a 100-fold
more potent for pde5 than for pde6, the pde
isoenzyme that is found exclusively in the retina
where it is responsible for the mechanism of phototransduction.  xxxd250xxx  shows higher selectivity
for pde5 versus pde6 (120-fold) than sildenafil
(16-fold) and vardenafil (21-fold), its selectivity
for pde5 versus pde1 ( xxxd1773xxx / xxxd1274xxx 
pde, dependent on calcium and calmodulin) is
greater than 10,000-fold (sildenafil: 380-fold; vardenafil: 1000-fold). in contrast to tadalafil, considerable inhibition by  xxxd250xxx  of pde11 (cyclic
amp/ xxxd1274xxx  pde, predominantly found in
testis, prostate and striated muscle) was not registered (selectivity for pde5 versus pde11:
>19,000-fold; tadalafil: 25-fold). these findings
imply that  xxxd250xxx  has little tendency to cause
visual disturbances (blue vision) and myalgia,

adverse effects reported by patients who are on
sildenafil or tadalafil, respectively. in in vivo animal studies, the effects of  xxxd250xxx  and sildenafil
on retinal function were examined by means of
electroretinogram recordings. at pharmacologically relevant doses, the drug was less likely to
affect retinal function than sildenafil, thereby providing further evidence for a significant reduction
of the nonspecific inhibition of pde6 by  xxxd250xxx 
[mochida et al. 2006]. in the anesthetized dog
model,  xxxd250xxx , administered either intravenously (i.v.; 3–300 µg/kg) or intraduodenally (i.d.;
0.1–1 mg/kg), has been shown to potentiate in a
dose-dependent manner penile tumescence (as
measured by means of the increase in intracavernous pressure) brought about by electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerves of the animals [kotera et al.
2012]. the efficacy of the drug was equivalent to
that of sildenafil: the percentages of enhancement by  xxxd250xxx  and sildenafil at maximum drug
concentrations were 325% and 304% (i.v.), and
415% and 358% (i.d.), respectively. after i.v.
administration, the 200% effective dose of  xxxd250xxx  was 37.5 mug/kg (sildenafil: 34.6 mug/kg), the
respective dose given i.d. amounted to 151.7 mug/kg
(sildenafil: 79.0 mug/kg) at peak time (= time to peak
response). the time to peak response was 10 min
with  xxxd250xxx  and 30 min with sildenafil, indicating a more rapid onset of the  xxxd250xxx  action. the
hypotensive response to the intravenous administration of  xxxd250xxx  (300 µg/kg/min) was weaker
than the drop in blood pressure registered after
the application of the same dose of sildenafil (–12
mmhg versus –22 mmhg, respectively). after
intraduodenal administration (0.1–1 mg/kg), the
potentiation by  xxxd250xxx  of the hypotension induced
by nitroglycerin was significantly less pronounced
than the effect exerted by sildenafil (peak area
under curve at maximum concentration: 146% for
 xxxd250xxx , 207% for sildenafil) [mochida et al. 2006].
clinical key data
 xxxd250xxx , administered in doses of 50 to 200 mg
(maximum dose), is rapidly absorbed, the median
time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax)
is 30–45 min in the fasting state and 1 h 20 min
when the drug is taken together with a high fat
meal. owing to clearance by the hepatic metabolism,  xxxd250xxx  is degraded into two major metabolites, designated as m4 and m16. the m4
metabolite accounts for approximately 23% of the
parent compound and 4% of its pharmacologic
activity, with an in vitro inhibitory potency for
pde5 of 18% of that of  xxxd250xxx . the m16

metabolite, accounting for approximately 29% of
the parent compound, is inactive against pde5.
in phase i settings to investigate the tolerability
and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug,
 xxxd250xxx  was shown to be rapidly absorbed after
oral administration, with a tmax of approximately
35–45 min. with regard to the elimination time
from the plasma, discordant data have been presented: the apparent t1/2 was estimated within a
range from 1 h 10 min to 1 h 20 min to a maximum of 5 h, as well as even 11 h (sildenafil: 3–4 h;
vardenafil: 4–5 h; tadalafil: 17.5 h). although
these values were similar among the different dose
units administered to the volunteers in the respective studies (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg), it remains
to be elucidated whether or not the t1/2 can be
considered a pharmacokinetic property that distinguishes  xxxd250xxx  from, for example, sildenafil
and vardenafil [allison et al. 2011; jung et al.
2010; peterson and swearingen, 2006]. the drug
was well tolerated, with headache and facial flushing being the most common adverse events demonstrated (4–11%). it was shown that the daily
administration of 200 mg  xxxd250xxx  for 14 days did
not result in a significant accumulation in the
plasma. this observation was regardless of the
dosage regimen, namely once or twice daily.
the safety and clinical efficacy of  xxxd250xxx  were
evaluated in several phase ii and iii trials involving a large number of male subjects with various
causes of ed. in a double-blind, randomized,
crossover, at-home phase ii trial in a cohort of 83
patients (mean age 52 years) with mild to moderate ed of a mean duration of 58 months,  xxxd250xxx 
at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg induced
significantly greater penile rigidity, as measured
by means of rigiscan®, than did placebo.
responses to  xxxd250xxx  were similar to or greater
than those to 50 mg sildenafil citrate. both drugs
induced erections sufficient to achieve vaginal
penetration in approximately 80% of the attempts
within an average time of 20 min; however, the
peak response to  xxxd250xxx  occurred within 20–40
min after administration, while the peak response
to sildenafil occurred in the median (60–80 min)
or late (100–120 min) time window [hellstrom
et al. 2012]. this provides further evidence that
 xxxd250xxx  is rapidly absorbed, with a fast onset of
drug action.
a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, paralleldesign phase ii trial assessed the efficacy and safety
of different doses of  xxxd250xxx . after a 4-week nontreatment run-in period, 284 men (aged 32–70 years)

table 1. randomized, placebo-controlled phase ii and iii clinical trials investigating the efficacy of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitor  xxxd250xxx  in patients
with mild to severe erectile dysfunction. treatment period in all trials listed was 12 weeks (after a 4-week nontreatment run-in period). for the clinical key data
presented by zhao et al. [2012], see the text.

therapeutic advances in urology 5 (1)
with mild to moderate ed were randomly assigned
to treatment for 12 weeks with placebo or  xxxd250xxx 
at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 300 mg. the
mean duration of ed was 66.7 months, 87% of the
subjects had used oral ed medications prior to their
enrollment in the study. subjects were instructed to
take the drug 30 min before the initiation of sexual
activities. primary efficacy outcomes included questions 2 and 3 of the sexual encounter profile (sep)
(sep 2 = the percentage of sexual attempts in which
subjects were able to achieve vaginal penetration; sep
3 = the percentage of sexual attempts in which subjects
were able to maintain erections long enough for successful
completion of intercourse) and the erectile function
(ef) domain score of the international index of
erectile function (iief) questionnaire. all primary outcome parameters were significantly
improved at all doses.  xxxd250xxx  induced erections sufficient for vaginal penetration on 76%, 79%, 80%
and 84% of the attempts for the 50 mg, 100 mg,
200 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively (placebo
60%). sep 3 rates were 54%, 59%, 62% and 64%
for the 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg doses,
respectively (versus 28% of attempts in the placebo
group) [kaufman and dietrich, 2006].
a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase iii study assessed the efficacy and safety of 100 mg and 200 mg of  xxxd250xxx 
in 200 patients (mean age 56 years, mean duration of ed ≥ 6 months) with so-called generalized
ed of varying etiologies. iief-ef domain scores
at the time of enrollment were: ≤10 = severe: 20%
of patients; 11–16 = moderate: 48% of patients;
17–25 = mild: 32% of patients. 40% of the subjects had used oral ed medications prior to the
study. after a 4-week run-in period, subjects were
assigned to treatment for 12 weeks with placebo
or  xxxd250xxx  (taken 30 min before the initiation of
sexual activities). there was no restriction on
alcohol or food intake. the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the iief-ef domain
score; secondary efficacy parameters were sep 2
and sep 3, potential shift to normal ef domain
score (≥26), and the response to the global
assessment questionnaire ( xxxg923xxx , has the treatment you have been taking improved your erections?).
 xxxd250xxx  was significantly superior to placebo for
all primary and secondary outcome parameters.
no significant differences were observed between
the two dose units. after 12 weeks of treatment,
iief-ef domain scores were shifted from 15.2 to
23.7 points with 100 mg  xxxd250xxx  and from 14.1
to 22.9 points with 200 mg (placebo: 14.5 to 18
points) [zhao et al. 2012]. surprisingly, the

authors present data from their study indicating
that, in the group of patients who were on  xxxd250xxx , the response rates indicating successful vaginal
penetration (sep 2) were lower (27% and 29%,
respectively, versus 15.7% in the placebo group)
than the sep 3 rates (increase to 54.3% after 12
weeks at 100 mg and 55.3% at 200 mg versus
25.8% for placebo). unfortunately, the manuscript does not provide any guidance to help the
reader to understand these data. one possible
explanation might be that the authors (i) took, by
mistake, sep 3 for sep 2 and vice versa or (ii) the
sep2 data given are likely to indicate negative
attempts (failure) than positive response rates.
however, the improvements in the orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction and
overall satisfaction scores also favored  xxxd250xxx 
over placebo. with regard to the efficacy of the
drug, no significant differences were observed
between patients who had previous pde5 inhibitor experiences and those who did not (pde5
inhibitor-naive). the adverse events seen were in
general mild to moderate in severity and attenuated after termination of treatment.
in another multicenter, double-blind, phase iii
trial, 646 men with mild to severe ed were randomized to either  xxxd250xxx  (50 mg, 100 mg or
200 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. subjects had an
average age of 56 years, with an average duration
of their ed of 79.3 months and an average iief
domain score of 12.7 points. a total of 73% of the
subjects surveyed had a history of previous oral
ed treatment. primary efficacy outcomes were
the improvement in erectile function as measured
by sep 2 and sep 3 and improvements in the
iief-ef domain score. secondary outcome
parameters were changes in the responses regarding the other iief domains (orgasmic function,
sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction and overall
satisfaction), determination of the proportion
of subjects with a normalized iief-ef domain
score, as well as an analysis of the number of successful intercourse attempts at various times postdosage. the 50 mg dose was inferior to the 100
and 200 mg doses, while the efficacy of 100 and
200 mg of  xxxd250xxx  were similar. at the end of the
treatment period, sep 2 rates had increased from
45% to 64% (50 mg), 47% to 74% (100 mg) and
48% to 77% (200 mg), while success rates in the
placebo group had improved from 47% to 54%.
the sep 3 rates increased from 13% to 41%
(50 mg), 14% to 57% (100 mg) and 12% to 57%
(200 mg) versus 13% to 27% in the placebo group.
the iief-ef domain score demonstrated signifi-

cant improvements from 12.6 to 18.1
(50 mg), 12.6 to 20.9 (100 mg) and 12.8 to 22.2
(200 mg). changes in other domains of the iief
(orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction) also significantly
favored  xxxd250xxx  over placebo.  xxxd250xxx  in doses of
50, 100 and 200 mg normalized the iief-ef
domain score in 12% (50 mg), 29% (100 mg) and
31% (200 mg) of subjects with severe ed, 19%,
43% and 46% with moderate ed, and in 35%,
52% and 57% of those with mild ed, respectively.
out of the total of 300 sexual attempts for sexual intercourse that were made within 15 min
after dosage, 64–71% were successful in the
 xxxd250xxx  group in comparison with 27% in the
placebo group. the number of successful
attempts occurring at 15–30 min, 30–45 min,
2–4 hours and 4–6 hours post-dosing were also
significantly higher in comparison with placebo.
interestingly, of the 80 sexual attempts occurring >6 hours post-dosage, 59–83% were successful with  xxxd250xxx  (placebo: 25%). rates of
discontinuation from the  xxxd250xxx  dose groups
due to adverse events were between only 1.9%
and 3.7% [goldstein et al. 2012b].
the efficacy of  xxxd250xxx  was also evaluated in socalled difficult-to-treat cohorts, including ed
patients with comorbid diabetes, as well as individuals following radical prostatectomy due to
localized cancer. in 390 men with ed and
comorbid diabetes,  xxxd250xxx , administered in
doses of 100 or 200 mg, significantly improved
all primary endpoints: sep 2, sep 3 and the
iief-ef domain score. sep 2 rates increased
from 32% to 54% and 42% to 63% for the 100
and 200 mg doses, respectively. in the placebo
group, success rates increased from 36% to 42%.
sep 3 rates were enhanced from 8% to 34%
(with the 100 mg dose) and 40% (with the
200 mg dose) versus 10 % up to 20% with placebo. mean changes in the iief-ef domain were
4.6 and 5.4 points for 100 and 200 mg doses,
respectively (placebo: 1.9 points). successful intercourses were also reported from subjects who
conducted attempts at <15 min and >6 hours
post-dosing [goldstein et al. 2012a].
in another study, 298 men with mild to severe
ed, who had undergone bilateral nerve-sparing
radical prostatectomy, were randomized to either
 xxxd250xxx  100 or 200 mg or placebo for 12 weeks.
the average duration of ed prior to the inclusion
in the study was 19 months post-surgery. a total
of 72% of the subjects had severe ed at baseline.

primary endpoints included improvements in
sep 2, sep 3 and the iief-ef domain score. a
total of 252 subjects completed the study. in comparison with placebo, both doses of  xxxd250xxx  significantly improved all primary endpoints. at the
end of treatment, sep 2 rates had increased from
17% to 32% and 20% to 41% with the 100 and
200 mg doses, respectively (placebo: 0%). sep 3
rates were enhanced from 5% to 23% (with
100 mg of  xxxd250xxx ) and 26% (with 200 mg) (placebo group: from 4% to 9%). mean changes in the
iief-ef domain were 3.5 points and 5.2 points
with 100 and 200 mg doses, respectively (placebo:
0.1 points). among the  xxxd250xxx  treatment groups,
one-third to one-half of all intercourse attempts
conducted at ≤15 min and ≤30 min, respectively,
after administration of the drug were successful.
the observation that efficacy rates were relatively
low in the difficult-to-treat populations is well in
agreement with the hypothesis that the action of
all pde5 inhibitors requires unimpaired neuronal
input into the corpus cavernosum as well as intact
vascular/cavernous endothelial structures
[mulhall et al. 2012].
an open-label extension study of the two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase iii trials, as mentioned above,
has evaluated the safety and efficacy of  xxxd250xxx 
over a period of up to 52 weeks. a total of 712
subjects with mild to severe ed with or without
comorbid diabetes were enrolled and subjected to
100 mg of  xxxd250xxx . there was no restriction with
regard to the intake of the drug together with food
or alcohol; patients who were on alpha-blocker
medication were not excluded from the study.
increase to 200 mg or decrease to 50 mg was permitted if necessary to increase efficacy or to
improve tolerability. the mean duration of ed
was 76 months, 32% of the subjects had diabetes
mellitus type 1 or 2, and 38% of the subjects had
severe ed at baseline. a total of 493 subjects
completed at least 26 weeks on active treatment
and 153 subjects completed ≥52 weeks; 75% of
patients increased their dose to 200 mg. primary
endpoints were improvements in sep 2, sep 3
and the iief-ef domain score. during treatment, the sep 2 rate increased from 44% to
83.3% with 100 mg only (147 subjects) and to
79.4% in those who escalated the dose from
100 to 200 mg (535 subjects). corresponding
results for sep 3 rates were 67.7% (baseline:
13.3%) in the 100 mg group and 66.3% (baseline: 11.4%) in the dose escalation group. mean

changes in the iief-ef domain were 8.6 and
10.8 points with 100 mg and 100/200 mg, respectively. a total of 84% of sexual attempts were
made within 60 min after dosing, with 79.6% of
the successful intercourses reported as early as
15 min. in some subjects, the erectogenic effect
of the drug was sustained beyond 6 h [belkoff
et al. 2011]. there were no serious drug-related
adverse events. not surprisingly, the drop-out
rate due to adverse events was <3%.
protocols to assess the hemodynamic effects of
the co-administration of  xxxd250xxx  with glyceryl
trinitrate (gtn) were also carried out using a
double-blind, cross-over design. a total of 106
healthy males, aged 30–60 years, were randomly
given at separate visits placebo, 200 mg  xxxd250xxx 
and 100 mg sildenafil, and the systolic blood
pressure (sbp) and heart rate (hr) measured.
when administered 12 h prior to nitrate,  xxxd250xxx  had no considerable effect on sbp or hr.
clinically significant drops in sbp (30 mmhg or
more) were seen in 11 subjects following placebo,
14 subjects following  xxxd250xxx  and 28 subjects following sildenafil. in comparison with sildenafil, the
co-administration of  xxxd250xxx  and gtn resulted in
smaller changes in sbp and hr, a shorter duration of interaction, and fewer subjects with significant hypotension events. thus,  xxxd250xxx 
might be a preferable ed medication for those
patients who are using nitrates [nehra et al.
2006].
conclusion
when compared with the other pde5 inhibitors
that have been made available to the international
markets,  xxxd250xxx  has a unique selectivity profile,
resulting in a favorable in vitro and in vivo potency
and fast onset of action. penile erection occurs
between 20 and 40 min after dosage, and successful intercourse has been observed even as early as
15 min after administration of the drug. moreover,
 xxxd250xxx  is associated with low rates of hemodynamic side effects and a shorter duration of
interaction in combination with no-releasing
drugs, such as  xxxd2741xxx . the faster onset
of action and sustained duration of the erectogenic
effect of the drug could be associated with more
spontaneous sexual activity for ed patients and
their female partners. the cumulative data also
suggest that  xxxd250xxx  might be a particularly suitable medication for patients with ed and comorbid cardiovascular diseases who are on nitrates.
