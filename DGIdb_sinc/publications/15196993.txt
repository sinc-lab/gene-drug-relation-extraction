abstract
cystathionine b-synthase catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine in a  xxxd3047xxx 
(plp)-dependent reaction. the human enzyme contains a single heme per monomer that is bound in an n-terminal 69 amino acid
extension that is missing from the otherwise highly homologous yeast enzyme. the heme dominates the uv–visible spectrum and
obscures kinetic characterization of the plp-bound reaction intermediates. in this study, we have engineered a hemeless mutant of
human cystathionine b-synthase by deletion of the n-terminal 69 amino acids. the resulting variant displays 40% of the activity
seen with the wild type enzyme, binds stoichiometric amounts of plp, and permits spectral characterization of plp-based intermediates. the enzyme as isolated exhibits an absorption maximum at 412 nm corresponding to a protonated internal aldimine.
addition of serine shifts the kmax to 420 nm (assigned as the external aldimine) with a broad shoulder between 450 and 500 nm
(assigned as the aminoacrylate intermediate). addition of the product, cystathionine, also leads to formation of an external aldimine
(420 nm). homocysteine elicits a red shift (and a decrease in absorption) in the spectrum from 412 to 424 nm and an increase in
absorption at 330 nm, presumably due to formation of a dead-end complex. mutation of  xxxd1682xxx , the residue that forms the schiﬀ
base, to alanine results in a 103 -fold decrease in activity, which increases 2-fold in the presence of an exogenous base, ethylamine.
spectral shifts (412 ! 420 nm) consistent with the formation of external aldimines are observed in the presence of serine or cystathionine, but an aminoacrylate intermediate is not formed at detectable levels. these results are consistent with an additional role
for  xxxd1682xxx  as a general base in the reaction catalyzed by human cystathionine b-synthase.

two classes of cystathionine b-synthases can be distinguished in nature. in mammals, such as rat [1] and human [2], the enzyme contains an additional cofactor,
iron  xxxd3037xxx , whereas the yeast [3] and protozoan enzyme from trypanosoma cruzi [4] lack heme.
the mammalian cystathionine b-synthases have an 70
amino acid long n-terminal extension which constitutes
the binding domain for this cofactor [5] (fig. 1). interestingly, the cystathionine b-synthases from dictyostelium and drosophila have a shorter n-terminal extension
in which the cysteine and histidine residues corresponding to the heme ligands in the human enzyme
appear to be conserved (fig. 1). this suggests that cystathionine b-synthase in the slime mold and fruit ﬂy are
hemeproteins, a prediction that awaits biochemical

evaluation. it also suggests that the poorly structured
heme domain is an early evolutionary innovation in the
crown group that arose before the separation of animals
and the slime mold.
the catalytic core of the protein, which is immediately downstream of the heme-binding site, is highly
conserved among the diﬀerent cystathionine b-synthases
and is homologous to other members of the b- or fold ii
family of plp enzymes such as o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase [6,7]. indeed, the crystal structures of
o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase and of the catalytic core of
cystathionine b-synthase reveal remarkable conservation of active site residues [5,8]. in the human enzyme,

 xxxd1682xxx  is the residue that forms a schiﬀ base with the plp
[9]. this lysine residue and the adjoining sequence are
highly conserved in all cystathionine b-synthases
(fig. 1). the c-terminal domain of the mammalian enzymes constitutes an allosteric domain and  xxxd3156xxx , a
positive eﬀector, binds in this region [10]. deletion of the
c-terminal 143 amino acids leads to highly active enzyme [11,12], which exists as a dimer rather than as an
assembly of tetramers, and is no longer responsive to
 xxxd3156xxx  [13].
the heme in human cystathionine b-synthase is
bound by a loop, in what is an unusual heme domain
that donates the two axial ligands,  xxxd1484xxx  and h65 [5,14].

the heme is spectroscopically distinct and has soret
absorption peaks at 428 and 448 nm in the ferric and
ferrous states, respectively. it is very inert to exchange of
the endogenous ligands by exogenous agents in the ferric
state. however, in the ferrous state, the heme complexes
with no, co, and isonitriles [15–17]. binding of no
and co is accompanied by inhibition of enzyme activity
while a change in the redox state from ferric to ferrous
results in a modest 2-fold decrease in activity [18].
these observations are consistent with a regulatory role
for the heme in cystathionine b-synthase.
two major pathways exist for removal of homocysteine, which is toxic at elevated levels and is correlated
with cardiovascular diseases [19], neural tube defects
[20], and alzheimerõs disease [21]. the transmethylation
pathway converts homocysteine to methionine; and the
transsulfuration pathway converts homocysteine to
cystathionine and thereon to cysteine and represents the
only avenue for the catabolic removal of homocysteine.
mutations in the cystathionine b-synthase gene are the
single most common cause of hereditary homocystinuria, an inborn metabolic disorder, which is characterized
by severely elevated levels of plasma homocysteine [22].
mental retardation, ecotopia lentis, skeletal abnormalities, and thrombotic vascular diseases are the common
clinical phenotypes associated with cystathionine bsynthase deﬁciency.
 apart in the
the heme and plp cofactors are 20 a
structure of the c-terminally truncated dimeric form of
the protein [5,23]. the heme was not expected to be
catalytically essential in the human enzyme since the
highly homologous but hemeless yeast enzyme catalyzes
the same overall reaction with similar steady-state kinetic parameters [3,24]. the mechanism of human cys-

tathionine b-synthase is predicted to involve the
intermediacy of plp-bound species in analogy with
other enzymes catalyzing b-replacement reactions
(fig. 2). the presence of heme in human cystathionine
b-synthase dominates the electronic absorption spectrum and masks the plp absorption spectrum rendering
impossible, direct observation of plp-bound catalytic
intermediates. although the yeast and human enzymes
catalyze the same overall reaction, the detailed kinetics
appear to be diﬀerent based on comparisons between the
kinetic characterization of the yeast enzyme, in which an
aminoacrylate intermediate is seen in the presence of
serine [25,26] and the human enzyme, where this intermediate does not appear to accumulate to a signiﬁcant
extent as determined by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy [13]
and poor tritium exchange from the a-carbon of serine
in the absence of homocysteine [27].
in the crystalline state, the human enzyme loses its
heme when the ferrous form is exposed to carbon
monoxide [28]. although the catalytic activity of this
hemeless enzyme was not measured, exposure of the
crystals to serine led to formation of an aminoacrylate
species [28]. when both serine and homocysteine (the
latter in slight excess) were added to the hemeless crystals, a spectrum similar to that of the internal aldimine
was observed. while these data suggested retention of
enzyme activity in the absence of heme, product formation was not monitored and other properties of the
enzyme such as responsiveness to the allosteric eﬀector,
 xxxd3156xxx , and reactivity toward cystathionine were not
characterized.
in this study, we have created the cbs-dn69 deletion
(hemeless) mutant lacking the entire heme binding sequence, to visualize the plp-bound intermediates by

uv–visible spectroscopy. in addition, we have mutated
the active site residue,  xxxd1682xxx , which forms a schiﬀ base
with plp, to alanine in the full-length and hemeless
variants to evaluate its role as a general base that catalyzes aminoacrylate formation. the hemeless variant is
active, but surprisingly, the deletion reverses the responsiveness of the resulting enzyme to the allosteric
regulator,  xxxd3156xxx , indicating interactions between the
n- and c-terminal domains are important in the regulation of the human enzyme. the k119a mutation results in a 103 -fold decrease in activity compared to the
full-length enzyme and results in spectral changes in the
hemeless background that are consistent with its role as
a general base in the reaction cycle.

addition, 50 lm plp was added to all buﬀers during
puriﬁcation except in the last anion exchange chromatography step. enzyme activity was measured using
[14 c]serine as described previously [18]. protein concentration was determined by the bradford method,
using reagents from bio-rad, and bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
the ph dependence of the hemeless enzyme activity
was measured using the standard radiolabeled assay,
except that 250 mm  xxxd1593xxx  buﬀer ranging
from ph 6.86 to 9.96 was employed. the ph dependence of the wild type enzyme in the same buﬀer was
determined for comparison.

materials and methods
materials
serine, plp, iptg, and d ,l -homocysteine were
purchased from sigma. [14 c]serine (158 mci/mmol) was
purchased from amersham. gst sepharose and qsepharose (fast ﬂow) were purchased from pharmacia.

the plp concentration was determined by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy as described previously [15]. brieﬂy,
the protein bound plp was released with 5 mm nh2 oh
and the ﬂuorescence emission of the plp oxime was
detected at 446 nm following excitation at 353 nm. a
standard curve was generated with samples of known
plp concentration which was established using
e295 ¼ 5.1 mm1 cm1 in 0.1 n hcl.

construction of mutants
the cbs-dn69 mutant was constructed using the
quick change kit (stratagene)-based strategy to create
an additional sali site at the 69th amino acid as described previously [23]. the quick change kit (stratagene) was employed to introduce the k119a mutation
using the parent pgex4t1/hcbs plasmid as template
and the following two primers:
sense: 50 :gcgggcgggagcgtggccgaccgc
atcagcctg
antisense: 50 :caggctgatgcggtcggccacg
ctcccgcccgc
the k119a mutation was introduced into the cbsdn69 hemeless variant by site directed mutagenesis using the quick change kit from stratagene and the
above primers. the template for mutagenesis was
pgex4t1/hcbs-dn69. the sequences of all plasmid
constructs used in this study were veriﬁed by nucleotide
sequence determination at the genomics core facility
at the university of nebraska, lincoln.
protein puriﬁcation and enzyme assays
the hemeless variants (containing  xxxd1682xxx  or k119a)
as well as full-length k119a cystathionine b-synthase
were expressed as fusion proteins with a gst tag at the
n-termini of the proteins and puriﬁed following limited
thrombin digestion as described previously [18]. to
minimize proteolysis of the fusion protein in cells during
the post induction period, growth was continued for

results and discussion
expression and puriﬁcation of mutant proteins
the hemeless dn69 variant was expressed as a gstfusion protein. however, expression of the fusion protein at 25 °c resulted in signiﬁcant proteolysis in the
sonicate and accumulation of the gst but not the cystathionine b-synthase portion of the fusion. this problem was alleviated by expression at 15 °c instead of
25 °c following induction with iptg. the puriﬁcation
protocol reported for wild type enzyme was employed
for all three mutants, and yielded 2 mg of dn69,
0.5 mg of dn69/k119a, and 5 mg of the full-length
k119a mutant per liter of culture.
activity and cofactor content of the hemeless dn69
mutant
the dn69 mutant retains catalytic activity and exhibits a speciﬁc activity of 58  9 lmol h1 mg1 of
protein at 37 °c (table 1). this represents 40% of the
activity seen with the full-length enzyme under the same
conditions, i.e., in the absence of the allosteric activator,
 xxxd3156xxx . wild type cystathionine b-synthase exhibits a
bell-shaped dependence of enzyme activity on ph with
inﬂection points  xxxd2274xxx .9  0.2 and 8.8  0.2, respectively,
as reported previously [18]. the ph dependence of the
dn69 mutant is similar and it exhibits pka s of 7.9  0.1

and 10.0  0.2, respectively (not shown). however, in
contrast to wild type enzyme which displays a 2-fold
decrease in enzyme activity in the presence of reductants, viz., titanium citrate, the hemeless mutant is redox
insensitive under the same conditions [23].
deletion of the n-terminal extension yields a variant
that does not, as expected, bind heme and is yellow
(kmax ¼ 412 nm) rather than red, when concentrated,
consistent with the presence of plp but not heme
(fig. 3). fluorimetric determination of the plp content
reveals the presence of stoichiometric plp per monomer
in preparations in which plp was added to the lysis
buﬀer during cell wall disruption and in all the elution
buﬀers except in the ﬁnal anion exchange chromatography step (not shown).
allosteric regulation of dn69 by  xxxd3156xxx 
the c-terminal regulatory domain of cystathionine
b-synthase exhibits intrasteric control and inhibits the
activity of the wild type enzyme [11]. deletion of this
domain relieves autoinhibition, as does binding of the
allosteric regulator,  xxxd3156xxx , which activates the enzyme 2-fold [11,18]. therefore, binding of  xxxd3156xxx 

appears to bring about a conformational change that
alters the interaction between the catalytic domain and
the c-terminal regulatory domain. several mutations in
the c-terminal domain that are correlated with
hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia alleviate intrasteric
inhibition apparently by stabilizing the activated conformation even in the absence of  xxxd3156xxx  [29,30].
surprisingly, the dn69 mutant is inhibited 1.5-fold
by  xxxd3156xxx  (table 1). this reversal in behavior with
respect to the wild type enzyme suggests that in the
absence of the heme extension, the regulatory domain
may be displaced from the catalytic domain thereby
mimicking the activated conformation. binding of
 xxxd3156xxx  to this enzyme form stabilizes a conformer that
exhibits repressed enzyme activity. interestingly, mutations of the cysteine ligand to the heme, c52a, and
c52s, show a similar degree of inhibition by  xxxd3156xxx 
(ojha and banerjee, unpublished data). these results
provide evidence for interaction between the n-terminal
heme extension domain and the c-terminal regulatory
domain, which modulates activity of the catalytic core
of human cystathionine b-synthase. structural insight
into the organization of the full-length enzyme is presently unavailable because crystal structures of only the
catalytic domain missing the c-terminal regulatory domain have been reported [5,23].
a model for communication between the heme domain and
the active site
although the heme and plp cofactors are bound
 apart in the structure of the c-terminal truncated
20 a
enzyme [5,23], several lines of evidence reveal communication between these two distant sites. first, a change
in oxidation state of the heme inﬂuences the chemical
shift of the phosphorus resonance of plp in the 31 p
nmr spectrum [31]. second, mutation of heme ligands
alters the ph proﬁles of the resulting enzymes. both  xxxd1484xxx 
and h65 mutants display sigmoidal dependencies of
activity on ph and titrate with a single pka versus a bellshaped dependence and two pka s in wild type enzyme
[14]. third, the plp saturation in the heme ligand mutants and in dn69 is low when plp is not added to

r. evande et al. / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 427 (2004) 188–196

buﬀers during puriﬁcation. this indicates that perturbations in or loss of the heme domain weaken binding of
plp in the active site. fourth, binding of exogenous
ligands such as co and no or reduction of the heme
inhibits enzyme activity [15,16]. together, these observations reveal that changes in the heme domain are
transmitted to the active site.
these results may be rationalized based on the
structure of the dimeric catalytic core of human cystathionine b-synthase (fig. 4).  xxxd1484xxx , which is an axial ligand to heme, is hydrogen bonded to r266. the
residues extending from r266 to t257 lie in an a helix
that extends to the active site of the protein. the phosphate group of plp is anchored electrostatically via
interactions with t257 and t260. mutation of  xxxd1484xxx  is
predicted to disrupt the interaction between r266 and
 xxxd1484xxx , which could be transmitted to residues t257 and
t260 at the other end of the helix. this in turn could
alter the interaction between the phosphate group and
residues t257 and t260 resulting in weaker plp binding. interestingly, mutations in r266 and t257 are
correlated with hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia and

activity and cofactor content of k119a variants
introduction of the k119a mutation in the fulllength enzyme results in a 103 -fold decrease in enzyme
activity as compared to wild type enzyme (table 2).
surprisingly, the speciﬁc activities of the k119a mutants in the full-length (0.3 lmol h1 mg1 ) and dn69
(0.7 lmol h1 mg1 ) backgrounds are similar, although
the parent full-length enzyme exhibits a 2.7-fold higher
activity than the parent dn69 variant (table 1). to test
whether an exogenous base can compensate for the
k119a mutation, the speciﬁc activities of the k1119a
mutants were determined in the presence of 20 mm
ethylamine. both were enhanced 2-fold (table 2). partial
rescue by amines has been reported in lysine mutants of
other plp enzymes and has been most extensively and
elegantly characterized in aspartate aminotransferase
[32,33]. in the latter enzyme, exogenous primary amines
were shown to functionally replace the active site lysine
and their catalytic eﬃcacy was correlated to their basicity and molecular volume [33].
uv–visible absorption spectroscopy of dn69

fig. 4. a close-up of the structure of cystathionine b-synthase showing
a potential structural bridge between the heme and plp cofactors. the
heme ligand,  xxxd1484xxx , is hydrogen bonded to r266 located at the other end
of the helix from t260 and t257, which make hydrogen bonding
contacts with the phosphate group of plp. changes in the heme
pocket may be communicated to the active site via this pathway. the
ﬁgure was generated from pdb ﬁle 1m54.

the dn69 mutant as isolated exhibits absorption
maxima at 412 nm and a broad shoulder at 330 nm
(fig. 3), which are assigned as the ketoenamine and
enolimine tautomers of the internal aldimine, respectively. addition of serine results in a red shift in the
412 nm band to 420 nm, which is assigned as the external
aldimine between substrate and plp (fig. 5a). in addition, a broad absorption band between 460 and
510 nm is observed in the presence of serine and is assigned as the a-aminoacrylate intermediate. with yeast
cystathionine b-synthase, addition of serine converts the
internal aldimine to a 460 nm-absorbing aminoacrylate
intermediate [25,26]. the predominance of the external
aldimine rather than the aminoacrylate species in the
dn69 mutant is consistent with ﬂuorescence data on the
full-length human enzyme, which revealed formation of
the external aldimine (major) and the aminoacrylate

intermediate (minor) in the presence of serine [13]. additionally, formation of only low levels of aminoacrylate
in the presence of serine alone is indicated by the low
level of tritium released from the a-carbon of serine in
the absence of the second substrate, homocysteine, in rat
cystathionine b-synthase [27].
the decrease in absorption at 412 nm was used to
determine the binding constant for serine and found to
be 0.85  0.04 mm (table 1). this value is comparable
to the kd of 1.5  0.3 mm reported for the yeast enzyme
[26]. binding of cystathionine results in a shift in the
412 nm band to 420 nm and to an increase in absorption,
but long wavelength absorption corresponding to the
presence of the aminoacrylate is not observed (fig. 5b).
the 420 nm absorption peak is assigned as the external
aldimine of cystathionine. this is in contrast to the behavior of yeast cystathionine b-synthase, where the
aminoacrylate intermediate rather than the external aldimine accumulates in the presence of cystathionine. in
the forward reaction catalyzed by the yeast enzyme, the
transient formation of the external aldimine of cystathionine with an absorption maximum of 420 nm is
observed under presteady state conditions [26]. the kd
for cystathionine for the dn69 mutant is 1.2  0.2 mm

and is comparable to the kd of 1.6  0.3 mm reported
for the yeast enzyme [26].
addition of homocysteine to the dn69 mutant elicits
a red shift in the 412 nm band to 424 nm accompanied
by a decrease in absorption at that wavelength and an
increase in absorption at 330 nm with an isosbestic point
at 350 nm (fig. 5c). observation of these spectral
changes is unexpected and suggests formation of a deadend complex with homocysteine. the kd for homocysteine is 8.8  1.3 mm, which is signiﬁcantly higher than
the corresponding value for the yeast enzyme
(0.68  0.3 mm) measured under catalytic turnover
conditions [26]. l -cysteine forms a stable thiazolidine
complex with serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which
exhibits an absorption maximum at 330 nm [34]. based
on the similar spectroscopic change observed with cystathionine b-synthase, it is possible that a tetrahydrothiazine complex [35] is formed in human cystathionine
b-synthase in the presence of high concentrations of
homocysteine. alternatively, the 330 nm absorption
could represent a gem–diamine complex or arise from an
abortive transamination to form pmp, or it could represent an external aldimine, which is in the enolimine
tautomeric form.

of the parent dn69 enzyme, has an absorption maximum at 412 nm (fig. 6a). this is surprising since  xxxd1682xxx 
forms a schiﬀ base with plp in human cystathionine bsynthase and its mutation to alanine should result in the
presence of a plp aldehyde rather than an aldimine in
the active site. indeed, an aldehyde has been seen in
other plp enzymes in which the active site lysine has
been mutated [36,37]. however, mutation of the schiﬀ
base-forming lysine in o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase led
to isolation of enzyme in which methionine was bound

195

as an external aldimine to the plp [38,39]. given the
similarity between this enzyme and cystathionine bsynthase, we speculate that an amino acid such as methionine may be bound to the plp in the k119a mutant
of cystathionine b-synthase. however, our attempts to
isolate the putative external aldimine (by reduction with
sodium borohydride followed by hplc separation) and
to identify the compound by mass spectroscopy were
not successful. in o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, binding
of methionine to the k41a mutant induces a closed
conformation and renders the external aldimine resistant to reduction by sodium borohydride [38].
addition of serine results in an increase in absorption
and a red shift from 412 to 420 nm (fig. 6a). in contrast
to the parent dn69 enzyme, long wavelength absorption
in the 450–500 nm region corresponding the aminoacrylate intermediate is not observed in the k119a mutant
and provides circumstantial evidence for the role of
 xxxd1682xxx  as a general base. the kd for serine for the dn69/
k119a mutant is 4.2  0.8 mm (table 2). for comparison, the spectrum of free plp aldehyde in the same
buﬀer has an absorption maximum at 385 nm with a
shoulder at 330 nm and addition of serine results in a
spectrum with absorption maxima at 290, 320, and
400 nm (not shown).
addition of cystathionine to the dn69/k119a mutant also results in an increase in absorption and a shift
of the absorption maximum to 420 nm (fig. 6b), which
is assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine. the
kd for cystathionine is estimated to be 1.3  0.2 mm and
is similar to that of the parent dn69 enzyme (table 2).
addition of homocysteine results in a decrease in the
intensity of the 412 nm peak and an increase in the
330 nm absorption with an isosbestic point at 350 nm
(not shown). the kd for homocysteine is estimated to be
2.6  0.4 mm (table 2). as with the parent enzyme, the
330 nm absorption band formed in the presence of homocysteine is tentatively assigned to a tetrahydrothiazine complex with plp, although other possibilities,
discussed above, have not been ruled out.
conclusions

fig. 6. uv–visible absorption spectra of cbs- xxxd69xxx /k119a in the
presence of serine and cystathionine. varying concentrations of the
indicated amino acid were added to cbs- xxxd69xxx / xxxd1682xxx  (0.1 mg/ml) in
50 mm potassium phosphate buﬀer, ph 7.4. (a) l -serine ranging in
concentration from 0 to 14 mm was added and the lines from bottom
to top represent spectra in the presence of 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.7, and 3.9 mm
serine, respectively. only a subset of spectra is shown for clarity. (b)
cystathionine was added to cbs- xxxd69xxx / xxxd1682xxx  (0.3 mg/ml) in 50 mm
potassium phosphate buﬀer, ph 7.4, and ranged in concentration from
0 to 4.75 mm, with the lines from bottom to top indicating spectra in
the presence of 0, 0.7, 1.8, 2.8, and 4.0 mm cystathionine, respectively.
insets show binding isotherms in which the changes in absorption at
412 or 420 nm are plotted against the concentration of the respective
amino acids.

construction of a hemeless variant of human cystathionine b-synthase has permitted direct visualization of
plp-bound intermediates and provided insights into
domain interactions important for eﬀecting allosteric
regulation. in contrast to the wild type enzyme,  xxxd3156xxx 
functions as an allosteric inhibitor in the hemeless mutant, which suggests that the n- and c-termini interact
in the tertiary structure of the protein. loss of the heme
domain is accompanied by retention of 40% of the activity seen with wild type enzyme and establishes the
nonessentiality of the heme for catalytic turnover in the
human enzyme. availability of this mutant facilitates
uv–visible spectroscopic analysis of the reaction

intermediates in the human enzyme. accumulation of
the external aldimines of serine and cystathionine in
human cystathionine b-synthase contrasts with accumulation of the aminoacrylate intermediates in the yeast
enzyme in the presence of these two amino acids [3,25].
addition of serine results in the formation of a minor
species with an absorption band between 450 and
510 nm, which is assigned as the aminoacrylate intermediate. mutation of the active site  xxxd1682xxx  residue to
alanine results in a 103 -fold decrease in enzyme activity
which is enhanced 2-fold by provision of an exogenous
base, ethylamine. introduction of the k119a mutation
results in spectroscopic diﬀerences that are apparent in
the uv–visible absorption spectra of the dn69 and the
dn69/k119a enzymes. importantly, the aminoacrylate
species observed with the parent dn69 enzyme is not
seen in the  xxxd1682xxx  mutant. taken together, these results
are consistent with the role of  xxxd1682xxx  as a general base
that promotes deprotonation of the external aldimine of
serine to form the aminoacrylate intermediate.
