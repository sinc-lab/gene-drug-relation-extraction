both  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic and d(1)-dopaminergic neurotransmissions are involved in phenylpropanolamine-mediated feeding suppression in mice.  the anorectic action of phenylpropanolamine (ppa) has been attributed to the activation of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  adrenoceptors. it is unknown whether dopamine (da) receptor subtype was involved in this action. with a treating dose higher than those used in previous reports and a testing period mainly in the dark phase of a circadian rhythm, we found that da-ergic transmission was also involved in ppa anorexia. pretreatment of  xxxd2914xxx  or  xxxd3000xxx  could partly block ppa-induced anorexia, confirming the involvement of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  adrenoceptor subtype. in addition, pretreatment of haloperidol or sch 23390 could also partly block ppa anorexia, revealing the involvement of d(1) receptor subtype. moreover, co-administration of  xxxd3000xxx  and sch 23390 could completely block ppa anorexia, confirming the co-involvement of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  and d(1) receptor subtypes. these findings suggested that both subtypes of  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  adrenoceptor and d(1) receptor were involved in the anorectic action of ppa.
