the rates of intracellular protein degradation, of identically labelled populations of proteins,
were compared in hepatocytes cultured at 37 (on an adsorbed collagen layer) and in cells
preserved on gelatin gels  xxxd1891xxx c. the half-lives of the long-lived proteins were 35.48.6 h
(n=4) and 692.9216.9 h (n=4) respectively. proteolysis was substantially decreased  xxxd1891xxx c
but the rate of decrease remained constant. hepatocytes rapidly removed resorufin from the
culture medium. the resorufin was not being conjugated or accumulated within the cells.
 xxxd1875xxx , a potent inhibitor of  xxxg521xxx , at high concentration (500 ) caused
only a 72% decrease in the utilization of resorufin. the microsomal detoxifying enzyme,
cytochrome p-450 1a1 remained at a constant level in the preserved hepatocyte monolayers.
the results of this study strongly favour storing hepatocytes  xxxd1891xxx c rather than at 4 or 37c.

introduction
the phenotype of an organism or cell is the outward expression of the proteins that it contains. it
is well recognized that protein synthesis and protein degradation are of equal importance in maintaining the steady state levels of proteins in cells.
(blommaart et al., 1997), although proteins are
synthesized by a single general process intracellular
protein degradation involves multiple mechanisms.
the relative importance of the latter mechanisms is
cell type specific. in the non-dividing, diﬀerentiated
liver cells, all protein degradation essentially occurs
in the lysosomes (mortimore and ward, 1981)
whilst in dividing undiﬀerentiated cells the process
occurs mainly in the cytosol (bigelow et al., 1981).
a major problem with hepatocyte culture is that
the cells undergo phenotypic changes (bissell and
guzelian, 1980). in previous reports we have demonstrated that hepatocytes can be preserved as
monolayers on gelatin gels at low temperatures
(evans, 1994a, 1995). below 15c autophagy is
inhibited (seglen, 1987) and, since hepatic protein
degradation appears to largely involve this process,
phenotypic changes could be minimized by a pre1065–6995/99/020117+08 $30.00/0

vention of potential remodelling. protein degradation is a valuable indicator of sustained cell
viability (evans, 1994b), however, it has not been
measured over an extended time in hepatocytes
cultured at low temperatures due to their poor
stability (stefanovich et al., 1995). moreover, continued proteolysis has been suggested as a reason
for the restricted viability of liver organs at low
temperatures (calmus et al., 1995).
in this study the eﬀect of hypothermic preservation of hepatocytes on the degradation of labelled
proteins was compared with that of identically
labelled proteins degraded in hepatocytes at 37c
(on an adsorbed collagen layer).
a major drawback to using cultured hepatocytes
in toxicity testing has been the rapid decrease
(holme et al., 1983) and alteration in the isoenzyme
profile of cytochrome p-450 (stewart et al., 1985;
turner et al., 1988). the decrease has been
reported to result from a more rapid degradation
or an inactivation of the enzyme (newman et al.,
1982; paine, 1990) while the altered isoenzyme
pattern reflects phenotypic change (fry et al.,
1995). low temperature dramatically limits the
movement of membrane bound proteins (belzer
 1999 academic press

118

and southard, 1988). in the present investigation
the eﬀect of hypothermic preservation on the level
of a single membrane bound protein, cytochrome
p-450 1a1, was determined since maintenance of
distinct proteins would be invaluable for many
purposes.
materials and methods
preparation and culture of hepatocytes
hepatocytes were prepared as described previously
(evans, 1981; evans and mayer, 1982). the culture
medium was leibovitz l-15 medium (ph 7.4) supplemented with glucose (8.3 m), hepes (25 m),
insulin (0.8 g/ml), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated newborn calf serum and  xxxd2193xxx  (50 g/ml). the
hepatocytes were cultured on one of three diﬀerent
plates as indicated in the text. the first, gelatin gel
supports, were prepared on corning culture plates
(60-mm diameter) as described previously except
that the nacl (0.154 ) was replaced by leibovitz
l-15 medium (ph 7.4) supplemented with glucose
(8.3 m), hepes (25 m),  xxxd2193xxx  (50 g/ml)
and when appropriate, in protein degradation
experiments leucine (10 m). the second type of
plates were collagen-(type iii calf skin) coated
corning plates (60-mm diameter) as described previously (evans and mayer, 1983). the third type of
plates involved the cells being cultured directly on
primaria culture dishes (60-mm diameter, falcon).
labelling of hepatocytes with -[4, 5-3h] leucine
primaria plates were used. hepatocytes (3.0106
cells) were plated out in 3 ml leucine-free l-15
medium (ph 7.4) containing hepes (25 m), glucose (8.3 m), insulin (0.8 g/ml), dexamethasone
(10 6 ),  xxxd2193xxx  (50 g/ml) and 10% v/v heatinactivated newborn calf serum. the dishes were
placed in a humidified 37c incubator for 1.5 h to
allow cell attachment. the medium was changed
and supplemented with -[4, 5-3h] leucine (9 ci/
plate).
measurement of rates of intracellular protein
degradation
sixteen hours after adding the -[4, 5-3h] leucine
the medium on the plates was removed. the plates
were washed twice with leucine-supplemented cell
culture medium to remove unincorporated [3h] leucine and to allow the turnover of short-lived proteins (evans and mayer, 1982). each wash entailed

cell biology international, vol. 23, no. 2, 1999

replacing the culture medium on the plates with
3 ml leibovitz l-15 medium (ph 7.4) containing
hepes (25 m), glucose (8.3 m), insulin (0.8 g/
ml), dexamethasone (10 6 ),  xxxd2193xxx  (50 g/
ml), 10% v/v heat-inactivated newborn calf serum
and leucine (10 m). the plates were then returned
to the 37c-incubator for 4 h. following the second
wash the labelled cells were detached from the
dishes by trypsin (trypsin (0.5%) edta (0.2%) in
nacl (0.9%)). the hepatocytes were readily
detached and 1.5 ml of the wash medium was added
to each dish. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 50g for 3 min. the plates were washed
with a further 1.5 ml of wash medium which was
added to the cell pellets. the resuspended cells were
recentrifuged and subsequently washed twice more.
the hepatocytes were resuspended in the same
medium and passed through a nylon gauze
(500 m). the cells were diluted with the leucinesupplemented culture medium to give 106 cells/ml.
the labelled detached hepatocytes (3 ml) were
added to the collagen-coated and to the gelatin gel
plates. the plates were incubated at 20c for 2 h to
allow the cells to attach to the dishes. the medium
was changed and the hepatocytes placed in incubators at 37c for the collagen coated and  xxxd1891xxx c for
the gelatin plates. the medium on the collagencoated plates was changed at 24 h intervals. the
medium on the gelatin plates was not changed
during the experiment. at the times indicated in the
figure legends plates were harvested for analyses.
metabolism of resorufin by hepatocyte monolayers
initially it was intended to assay cytochrome p-450
1a1 by the appearance of resorufin formed from
ethoxyresorufin (burke et al., 1985). however,
initial experiments repeatedly failed to detect resorufin formation in the presence or absence of
 xxxd1875xxx  (10 ). this prompted an investigation
of the metabolism of resorufin at the cell density
being used in these experiments. resorufin was
dissolved in dmso and added to leibovitz l-15
medium (ph 7.4) to give final concentrations of
10  and 1% for resorufin and dmso respectively.  xxxd1875xxx  (0.1 ) was dissolved in 0.2 
naoh. an appropriate volume of the stock solution was added to leibovitz l-15 medium (ph 7.4)
containing glucose (8.3 m), hepes (25 m) and
 xxxd2193xxx  ( 50 g/ml). the  xxxd1875xxx  was
dissolved in the medium by warming at 37c.
concentrations up to 200  dissolved completely.
 xxxd1875xxx  (500 ) was used as a suspension.
the medium on the hepatocyte monolayers
(3106 cells) was replaced with 3 ml of

medium containing resorufin xxxd1875xxx . at
5 min intervals the plates and supernatants were
harvested.
the metabolism of resorufin was followed by
two diﬀerent procedures. first, the distinctive
absorption of resorufin was recorded as a function
of time (klotz et al., 1984). the second method
involved measuring the fluorescence of resorufin
with a filter fluorimeter. since live cells were being
used to determine the fate of resorufin, conjugation
with glucuronic acid or sulphate was a distinct
possibility so quenching the fluorescence (donato
et al., 1993). therefore, samples were deconjugated. this was carried out by a modification of the
method of donato et al. (1993). essentially 0.25 ml
of 0.1  sodium acetate buﬀer (ph 4.5) containing
-glucuronidase (156 fishman units) and arylsulphatase (894 roy units) was added to 0.75 ml of
the respective culture supernatants. the resulting
mixture was incubated at 37c for 2 h. the reaction
was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ethanol.

the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
15 mins and the fluorescence of the supernatants
determined.
ethoxyresorufin deacylase activity
this was measured by the decrease in absorbance
in the cell culture medium (482 nm) when the cells
were incubated with ethoxyresorufin (hammond
and strobel, 1992). the ethoxyresorufin was initially dissolved in dmso, prior to adding it to
leibovitz l-15 medium (ph 7.4) containing glucose (8.3 m), hepes (25 m) and  xxxd2193xxx 
(50 g/ml). the final concentration of ethoxyresorufin and dmso were 8  and 1%, respectively.
at the times indicated, the medium was removed
from the hepatocyte monolayer. the plates were
washed with 1 ml l-15 medium (ph 7.4) containing
glucose (8.3 m), hepes (25 m) and  xxxd2193xxx 
(50 g/ml). the ethoxyresorufin deacylase assay
was initiated by adding 3 ml of the ethoxyresorufin
containing medium to the plates. all measurements
were made xxxd1875xxx  (10 ). the reaction was

cell harvesting
the various culture media were removed from the
plates and stored at 20c. the hepatocytes on
the collagen-coated plates were washed with 1 ml
potassium phosphate buﬀer (0.1 ; ph 7.6) and the
cells harvested by scraping into 0.5 ml of the same
buﬀer. any cells remaining on the plates were
scraped into a further 0.5 ml of the same buﬀer.
the cell suspensions were frozen at 20c. the
labelled hepatocytes on the gelatin dishes were
collected by adding 3 ml fresh leucine-containing
medium to the plates. the monolayers were placed
in a 37c incubator to allow the gelatin to dissolve.
after 20 min the plates were removed from the
incubator and gently swirled. the resulting cell
suspensions were centrifuged at 100g for 5 min.
the plates were scraped twice with 0.5 ml potassium phosphate buﬀer (0.1 ; ph 7.6). these solutions were added to the cell pellets. hepatocyte
monolayers used for determining the metabolism
of resorufin or ethoxyresorufin deacylase activity
were washed with 1 ml of kcl (0.15 ) in tris–hcl
buﬀer (50 m; ph 7.4). the plates were then stored
at 20c.
other analyses
samples were thawed and the cell suspensions
disrupted by sonication (210 s bursts at an amplitude setting of 6 m peak to peak). protein and
the activity of lactate dehydrogenase were determined (evans, 1981). trichloroacetic acid-soluble
and insoluble [3h] leucine were both measured as
described previously (evans and mayer, 1983).

ensures that the degradation of the same population of proteins is being observed, enabling a direct
comparison of the treatments. the extended chase
period prior to starting the measurement ensures
that the atypical, short-lived proteins, do not
contribute to the observed degradation rates
(evans and mayer, 1982). the half-lives of the
labelled proteins are 35.48.6 h (n=4) and
692.9216.9 h (n=4) for the cells at 37 and 10c
respectively. clearly, culture  xxxd1891xxx c has greatly
reduced the rate of proteolysis, presumably by
suppressing autophagy which is inhibited below
15c (seglen 1987).
figures 1 and 2 show that the radioactivity
released from the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble
forms could be accounted for completely by the
radioactivity recovered in the trichloroacetic acidsoluble fraction. cell death was therefore minimal
under both sets of conditions. this was verified by

total protein measurements which showed that the
cells were in a steady state of protein metabolism at
37c with only a marginal decrease in protein
content  xxxd1891xxx c (4.20.8%; n=5) at the end of the
experiment.
the functional integrity of hepatocytes cannot be
determined using a single test since the tests
measure diﬀerent criteria (fry and hammond,
1993). protein synthesis (incorporation of radioactive amino acids into proteins) can give a good
indication of the metabolic competence of cells
(evans, 1994a) but the time over which such
measurements can be made is limited and a plateau, due to isotope dilution or turnover, may be
reached before the detrimental nature of the treatment under investigation has been recognized.
moreover, during the initial stages such measurements are biased towards studying the synthesis of
short half-life proteins which are not representative
of most of the proteins of the cell (99%) which have
relatively long half-lives (mortimore and ward
1981). protein degradation is an energy requiring
process which as shown in the present study can be
measured for an extended time. as shown in figure
2 the rate of protein degradation  xxxd1891xxx c remains
unchanged throughout the culture demonstrating
that detrimental eﬀects do not appear over this
time span.
long-term liver preservation, prior to organ
transplantation is diﬃcult. while low temperature
is routinely used to slow the metabolic rate the
precise temperature remains uncertain. the whole
organ is too complex to resolve the cause of the
detrimental eﬀects, presently limiting storage to
24–48 h (jamieson et al., 1988). the problem can
be investigated by the study of isolated cells. hepatocyte suspensions at 4c have a limited viability
(vreugdenhil et al., 1992). similarly stefanovich
et al. (1995) have shown that hepatocyte monolayers sandwiched in collagen gels (and established
at 37c) rapidly lose their function and exhibit bleb
formation at 4c. brief culture at 4c is known to
depolymerize the microtubules of the cytoskeleton
(feldmann, 1989). the sustained viability of hepatocytes on gelatin gels  xxxd1891xxx c seen in the present
work and earlier studies (evans, 1994a, 1995)
strongly suggests that 10c may be a preferred
temperature for liver preservation.
the rapid decrease in cytochrome p-450 levels in
hepatocytes cultured at 37c occurs due to a rapid
degradation of these enzymes associated with a
complete absence of their synthesis (newman et al.,
1982; paine, 1990).  xxxd1891xxx  the movement of membrane proteins would be minimal (belzer and
southard, 1988) so that the degradation of these

proteins should be inhibited even more than that of
general labelled proteins. in order to test this the
activity of a microsomal detoxifying enzyme, cytochrome p-450 1a1, was measured as a function of
the preservation time. cytochrome p-450 1a1 was
determined by measuring the ethoxyresorufin deacylase activity (burke et al., 1985; donato et al.,
1993). the latter reaction can be measured either
by the appearance of the product resorufin or by
the disappearance of the substrate ethoxyresorufin
(hammond and strobel, 1992). preliminary
attempts to measure product formation were
unsuccessful in this study. lubet et al. (1985)
reported that resorufin was not detected in s9
supernatants due to its reduction by the enzyme
 xxxg521xxx .  xxxd1875xxx  (10 ) prevented this reaction. the utilization of resorufin by
intact cells has not been reported. resorufin has a
very characteristic absorption maximum at 572 nm.

of two separate cell preparations.

figure 3 shows the disappearance of resorufin
(10 ) from the culture medium due to processing
by hepatocyte monolayers (3.0106 cells/plate).
 xxxd1875xxx  (10 ) inhibited the fall in resorufin
levels by only 21%. the rapidity of resorufin
utilization explains why resorufin could not be
detected when ethoxyresorufin (8 ) was incubated with the cells. the loss of resorufin was not
due to its conjugation reactions (donato et al.,
1993) since incubation with arylsulphatase and
-glucuronidase (fig. 4) failed to regenerate resorufin. resorufin is being further metabolized by the
cells. the contribution of  xxxg521xxx 
to this process was investigated by increasing the
concentration of  xxxd1875xxx . as shown in figure 5
the maximum inhibiting eﬀect of  xxxd1875xxx 
(200 ) was 72%. it was possible that the residual
metabolism of resorufin was due to conjugation
reactions. however, deconjugation of the cell culture medium from hepatocytes treated with either
200  or 500   xxxd1875xxx  failed to produce
resorufin.

previously hammond and strobel (1992)
reported that although a human colon tumour cell
line, ht-29, demonstrated ethoxyresorufin deacylase activity in its microsomes the production of
resorufin in intact cells could not be demonstrated.
they proposed that a defect in uptake, further
metabolism by  xxxg521xxx  or other
metabolic systems might explain this paradox.
ethoxyresorufin has an absorption maximum at
482 nm, allowing the reaction catalysed by
ethoxyresosrufin deacylase to be monitored by the
decrease in substrate concentration.
diﬀerence spectra (fig. 6) showed that ethoxyresorufin was being removed from the medium at a
linear rate and could not be detected within the
cells, indicating that it had been metabolized.
moreover, resorufin and its potential conjugates of
sulphate and glucuronic acid could not be detected
in the cells, showing that the absence of resorufin in
the medium was not a consequence of it being
retained within the hepatocytes.

leibovitz l-15 medium, which was used to preserve the cells in the current investigation is highly
enriched with amino acids. tyrosine levels are
substantially elevated over other cell culture media.
the inhibitor  xxxd1875xxx  is known to bind to a
tyrosine residue in  xxxg521xxx  (ma
et al., 1992). it is possible that the incomplete
inhibition of resorufin metabolism in the cultured
cells was due to competing tyrosine in the culture
medium. alternatively, other cytosolic quinone
reductases, more refractile to  xxxd1875xxx  have been
reported to metabolize quinones (wermuth, 1981).
the eﬀect of preservation time on ethoxyresorufin deacylase activity, judged by substrate utilization, is shown in figure 7. the level of activity is
preserved throughout the time analysed. consequently the preservation has prevented the usual
enhanced degradation of this system seen at 37c.
the mechanism by which this is accomplished is
unclear since the degradation is reported not to
involve overt autophagy (paine, 1990). it is possible that restricted movement prevents cytochrome
p-450 1a1 coming into contact with its degrada-
