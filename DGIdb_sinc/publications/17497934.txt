abstract: the adenylate-forming enzymes, including acyl-coa synthetases, the adenylation domains of
non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps), and firefly luciferase, perform two half-reactions in a pingpong mechanism. we have proposed a domain alternation mechanism for these enzymes whereby, upon
completion of the initial adenylation reaction, the c-terminal domain of these enzymes undergoes a 140°
rotation to perform the second thioester-forming half-reaction. structural and kinetic data of mutant enzymes
support this hypothesis. we present here mutations to salmonella enterica  xxxg51xxx  (acs)
and test the ability of the enzymes to catalyze the complete reaction and the adenylation half-reaction.
substitution of lys609 with alanine results in an enzyme that is unable to catalyze the adenylate reaction,
while the gly524 to leucine substitution is unable to catalyze the complete reaction yet catalyzes the
adenylation half-reaction with activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme. the positions of these two
residues, which are located on the mobile c-terminal domain, strongly support the domain alternation
hypothesis. we also present steady-state kinetic data of putative substrate-binding residues and demonstrate
that no single residue plays a dominant role in dictating coa binding. we have also created two mutations
in the active site to alter the acyl substrate specificity. finally, the crystallographic structures of wild-type
acs and mutants r194a, r584a, r584e, k609a, and v386a are presented to support the biochemical
analysis.

the adenylate-forming superfamily is composed of a
diverse group of enzymes that utilize atp and an acyl- or
aryl-carboxylate to form an adenylate intermediate. the
superfamily consists of three subfamilies: the acyl- or arylcoa synthetases (also called ligases), the adenylation
domains of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (nrpss1)
(1-3), and the firefly luciferases. between the subfamilies
there is 20% to 40% sequence homology (4, 5). the acyladenylate intermediate usually reacts with the pantetheine
thiol of an acyl carrier protein or coa to form a thioester.
in the case of the firefly luciferase subfamily, however, the
adenylate reacts in an oxidative decarboxylation to yield an

activated carbonyl that decomposes to emit light. the average
size of these enzymes is 500-700 amino acids in length.
the structures of several family members demonstrate that
the enzymes contain a large 400-550 residue n-terminal
domain and a smaller ∼130 residue c-terminal domain.
the 72 kda  xxxg51xxx  (acs, ec 6.2.1.1) from
salmonella enterica is part of the adenylate-forming superfamily (6). this enzyme allows bacteria to use acetate as a
sole carbon and energy source. in low acetate concentrations,
acs is responsible for acetyl-coa synthesis, while at higher
concentrations, acetyl-coa production is carried about by
acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase (7). synthesis of
acetyl-coa is carried out in two steps. in the first halfreaction acs combines acetate with atp to form an acyladenylate. in the second half-reaction, the thiol of coa
attacks the acyl carbon displacing the amp leaving group
to form the product acetyl-coa (scheme 1).

structure/function studies of acs

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 22, 2007 6537

scheme 1

members of the adenylate-forming superfamily contain ten
regions of highly conserved residues that have been named
a1-a10 (2). a conserved residue, part of the a8 region,
forms a hinge that bridges the n-terminus to the c-terminus
of these enzymes (6). this conserved hinge residue is usually
an  xxxd233xxx  (asp517 for acs); however, a lysine residue
has also been observed (8). the a10 conserved region
contains a lysine at the c-terminus of the adenylate-forming
enzymes with a consensus sequence of pxxxxgk (lys609
in acs). this residue is known to be important for the
adenylate-forming half-reaction based upon kinetic studies
of propionyl-coa synthetase and firefly luciferase (9, 10).
the a5 conserved sequence of ygxte is found at the atp
binding pocket, which can be seen in the 4-chlorobenzoate:
coa ligase/synthetase (cbal) (11),  xxxd2901xxx  (12), and firefly
luciferase (8) structures. in acs, this sequence is modified
to w413wqte; trp413 is orientated away from the active
site, while trp414 truncates the acyl binding pocket, accommodating the small acyl substrate acetate. finally, there
is a highly conserved region with the consensus sequence
of (s/t)(s/t/g)g(s/t)(s/t)gxpkg (thr264-gly273 of
acs). this glycine- and ser/thr-rich sequence of the a3
region is thought to play a role in orientating the three
phosphates of atp prior to the first half-reaction (13) in a
manner that is somewhat analogous to the walker p-loop of
certain nucleotide hydrolases (14).
the conserved hinge residue is proposed to be the pivot
point for a c-terminal rotation of ∼140° allowing for both
half-reaction to occur (6). this domain alternation hypothesis
arises from biochemical and crystallographic studies of a
number of adenylate-forming enzyme. the three-dimensional

structures of  xxxd2901xxx  (12), dhbe (15), cbal (11), and
eukaryotic acs (16) have been solved in the proposed
adenylate-forming conformation. firefly luciferase has been
solved in the adenylate forming conformation (17), as well
as in an intermediate conformation of unknown significance
(8). prokaryotic acs (6) was solved with the c-terminus
rotated ∼140° and in the presence of coa relative to the
orientation seen in the original  xxxd2901xxx  structure.
we present here a series of structural and functional studies
of site-directed mutants of acs. residues from both the nand c-terminal domains were chosen to explore the impact
of side chain substitution on the steady-state kinetics of atp
and coa. in addition to residues that interact with the coa,
we have also mutated the hinge  xxxd233xxx  residue of the
a8 region to glycine and proline in an attempt to increase
and decrease, respectively, the conformational flexibility of
this residue. finally, in light of the relative promiscuity of
the members of this family to recognize multiple acyl
containing substrates (9, 18, 19), several residues were
mutated to alter the acyl substrate specificity. crystallographic structures of the ligand bound wild-type enzyme,
as well as the r194a, r584a, r584e, k609a, and v386a
mutant proteins, are also presented.

provided by dr. alex horswill and dr. jorge escalantesemerena (9). nadh, sodium acetate, pyruvate, coa, amp,
hepps, btp, and hepps, as well as  xxxg107xxx , pyruvate
kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, used in the coupled

enzyme assay, were from sigma-aldrich (milwaukee, wi).
the 32p-ppi was obtained from perkin-elmer life sciences
(shelton, ct). tcep was from hampton research (aliso
viejo, ca).  xxxd2982xxx  (8000 mw) was from fluka
(milwaukee, wi).
acs mutagenesis. mutations were made to wild-type acs/
ptyb1 construct (6), using the quikchange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca). mutagenic
primers were designed to introduce silent restriction sites
for preliminary identification of mutants. plasmid sequences
were confirmed to contain the mutation by dna sequencing
of the acs gene at roswell park cancer institute, buffalo,
ny.
expression and purification of wild-type acs and mutants. wild-type and mutant acs proteins were purified as
reported previously (6). lb containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin
was inoculated with bl21(de3) cells harboring the expression plasmid and grown overnight at 37 °c in a shaker. the
25 ml culture was used to inoculate a 1 l flask. cells were
grown at 16 °c. at mid log phase (od600 ) 0.6) cells were
induced with 1 mm iptg and allowed to grow for 1215 h. cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80 °c until needed. purification
was achieved utilizing the impact protein purification
system (new england biolabs, ipswich, ma). acs is
produced as a c-terminal fusion protein with a chitin-binding
domain, joined by a modified intein that is susceptible to
thiol-dependent cleavage (20). the protein is adsorbed to a
chitin affinity column and incubated for 40 h at 4 °c on
column with 30 mm dtt. following thiol-dependent
cleavage of the chitin binding domain-intein fusion protein,
the 652-residue protein with no extra residues derived from
the expression vector is eluted from the column. after
purification, protein was dialyzed to 10 mm epps (ph 8.0)
and 0.2 mm tcep. wild-type and mutant proteins were then
concentrated to >10 mg/ml and frozen as small aliquots in
liquid n2 until needed (21).
kinetic determination of apparent km, kcat, and kcat/km.
a nadh consumption assay (9) was used which contained
50 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.5, 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm tcep,
3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units of  xxxg107xxx , 1 unit
of pyruvate kinase, 1.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and
0.1 mm nadh. in this assay, the production of amp is
detected through coupled assays with  xxxg107xxx , which
catalyzes the production of 2 adp molecules from amp
and atp, pyruvate kinase, which converts phosphoenolpyruvate and adp to pyruvate and atp, and lactate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate to lactate with the oxidation
of nadh to nad+. the loss of nadh is monitored with
340 of 6220 m-1 min-1. apparent kinetic constants were
determined by varying one substrate while holding the
remaining two constant. to determine kinetic constants for
atp, coa and acetate were held constant at 1.0 mm and
20 mm, respectively, and atp was varied from 5 to
1000 µm. to determine kinetics for coa, atp and acetate
were held constant at 2.5 mm and 20 mm, and coa was
varied from 50 to 800 µm. assays were preincubated at
37 °c in disposable cuvettes in an agilent 8453 spectrophotometer with a circulating water jacket. the reaction was
initialized with 0.052 µm wild-type acs or 0.104 µm mutant
acs. acs proteins were diluted in 250 mm hepes buffer,
ph 7.5 before assay measurement. the reaction was moni-

using the program dynafit (22).
km, kcat, and kcat/km determination for acetate, propionate,
and glycine. the same coupled assay was used to determine
the kinetic constants for acetate, propionate, and glycine.
atp and coa were held constant at 2.5 mm and 1.5 mm,
respectively, while acetate varied from 0.5 mm to 5 mm,
propionate varied from 0.5 mm to 5 mm, and glycine varied
from 1 mm to 15 mm. the reaction was initialized with
0.005 µm wild-type acs, v386a, or v310d. proteins were
diluted in 250 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.5 before assay
measurements.
pyrophosphate exchange assay. the pyrophosphateexchange assay was used to measure the activity of the
adenylate-forming half-reaction by monitoring the incorporation of 32p-labeled pyrophosphate into atp through cycles
of the reversible adenylation half-reaction (23). the reaction
contained 2 mm atp, 0.2 mm nappi, 5 mm acetate,
50 mm hepes (ph 8.0), 100 mm nacl, 10 mm mgcl2,
and 1.5 µci/ml of 32ppi. the reaction was initialized with
10 µm enzyme and allowed to incubate at 37 °c for 10 min.
the reaction was quenched with a solution containing 1.2%
active charcoal, 0.1 m unlabeled ppi, and 0.35 m perchloric
acid. the charcoal pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of
h2o and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of h2o for scintillation counting. counts were converted to µmol/min/mg using
a standard curve of known activity. each assay was
performed with five replicates along with a control for
background.
crystallization of wild-type acs and mutant acs. crystals
were grown via the vapor diffusion method using 6-15%
peg 8000, 9-13% ethylene glycol, and 50 mm btp,
ph 6.5. wild-type acs was incubated with 1 mm of amp,
coa, and acetate prior to setup. 1 mm each of propyl-amp,
coa, and tcep was added to the mutant protein sample
before setup. crystals were cryoprotected by transferring
through three solutions containing increasing amounts of
ethylene glycol (14%, 18%, 24%) for approximately 1 min
each. the final cryoprotectant solution contained 25% peg
8000, 24% ethylene glycol, and 50 mm btp (ph 6.5). each
cryoprotectant solution contained 1.25 mm of ligand.
crystallographic data collection and data refinement.
data collection for wild-type acs and the mutants r194a
and v386a were collected at the national synchrotron light
source at brookhaven national laboratory at beamlines x4a
(r194a) and x12c (wild-type and v386a). data for mutants
r584a, r584e, and k609a were collected at the cornell
high energy synchrotron source beamline f2. two crystal
forms were identified from identical crystallization conditions, the monoclinic form observed in our original structure
(6) and a new orthorhombic form. both crystal forms
contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. all data
were processed with hkl2000 (24), except for the r584a
mutant crystals, which were processed with mosflm and
scala (25, 26), and converted from intensities to structure
factors with truncate of the ccp4 package (25). all
structures were solved by molecular replacement using
molrep (27) of the ccp4 package using the wild-type acs
(1pg4) structure as a search model with all non-protein atoms
removed. refinement of all structures was performed with
refmac5 (28) using weighted individual atomic b-factors.
manual model building was performed with turbo (29)

structure/function studies of acs
and coot (30). water molecules were included into
spherical or nearly spherical difference density that made
chemically plausible interactions with protein atoms or
neighboring waters. near the completion of refinement, tls
anisotropic refinement (31) was included for the n- and
c-terminal domains, which was monitored by a drop in the
rfree value. the final models all are missing the n-terminal
four or five residues and the c-terminal five or six residues
and contain one disordered loop at positions 623 through
633; the density of this disordered loop was of variable
quality, and the exact number of omitted residues varied from
two to ten. this loop and the disorder at the n- and c-termini
were also observed to be disordered in the original structure
(6).
results
to explore the effects of specific residues on the activity
of acs, a series of point mutations were constructed. mutant
enzymes were purified and subjected to steady-state kinetics
to determine apparent kinetic constants for atp and coa.
additionally, the effect of several mutations on the adenylation half-reaction was examined with the ppi-exchange
assay. the apparent kcat and km values for both atp and
coa are similar to constants that have been observed
previously for both prpe and cbal (9, 13).
mutation in lys609 from the c-terminal domain. previous
studies suggested that the lysine of the a10 region is
catalytically responsible for the first half-reaction (9, 10).
this lysine has been observed in structures of the adenylateforming conformation of  xxxd2901xxx  (12), dhbe (15), and luciferase (17) to interact with the r-phosphate of the
adenylate. s. enterica acs shares this conserved lysine at
position 609. mutation of this lysine in prpe has been shown
to block specifically the adenylation half-reaction while
leaving the thioester-forming half-reaction unaffected (9).
the acs enzyme from s. enterica (32) and mouse (33) have
been shown to be regulated by acetylation of this c-terminal
lysine; the enzyme is activated by the activity of a deacetylase
of the sirtuin family. a mutation from a lysine to an alanine
at position 609 was created in acs. no detectable activity
was observed for this mutant of acs in steady-state kinetic
experiments. the ability of this enzyme to catalyze the
adenylation half-reaction was determined with ppi-exchange
assay (see below).
mutations in residues that interact with coa or play a
role in stabilization of the thioester-forming conformation.
the previous structural characterization of acs in the
thioester-forming conformation in the presence of propylamp and coa (6) was used to identify residues that interact
with coa (figure 1) and perhaps stabilize the second halfreaction conformation. these residues were targeted for
analysis by site-directed mutagenesis. the results for the
kinetics are shown in table 1.
arg194 and arg584 interact with the coa 3′-phosphate
(6); these residues were mutated to alanine and glutamate.
the kcat values for the enzymes containing each of the four
mutations are reduced by roughly a factor of 2. the km
values for atp are reduced in each protein by an equivalent
amount resulting in no change in kcat/km with respect to atp.
the apparent kinetic constants for coa, however, show an
increase in km for coa ranging from 2- to 3-fold for the

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 22, 2007 6539
arg194 mutations and 7- to 8-fold for the arg584 mutations.
at limiting coa concentrations, the rates of kcat/km are
reduced as much as 20-fold.
acs contains an arg526 residue that is located on the
c-terminal domain on the loop joining a two-stranded
antiparallel beta-sheet that follows the asp517 hinge residue;
this arg is part of the a8 region and is highly conserved
although not to the same degree as the hinge residue
(asp517) and gly524. in the proposed thioester-forming
conformation, the arg526 forms an ionic interaction with
the highly conserved glu417 of the n-terminal domain
(figure 1a). in the crystal structure (6), the side chain also
interacts with the phosphate of the adenylate intermediate.
although arg526 does not interact directly with the coa,
we thought that it may stabilize the thioester-forming
conformation through the interaction with glu417. the
r526a mutation results in a 2-fold reduction in the apparent
kcat values for both atp and coa, and a 9.5-fold reduction
in kcat/km for coa.
two residues were identified that abut the channel that
the pantetheine group of coa occupies when bound. the
mutations made to these residues were designed to fill this
channel to prevent coa binding. the mutation of ala357 to
a valine exhibited only limited effects on coa binding with
a reduced kcat/km for coa by 6.3-fold. thus, the pantetheine
group of coa can still pass through the tunnel in the presence
of the larger side chain at position ala357.
a more dramatic result was observed with the second
mutation at the pantetheine binding tunnel. gly524 is
universally conserved in the a8 region of adenylate-forming
enzymes, occurring on a loop that follows the hinge between
the n- and c-terminal domains. the beta-alanine portion of
coa passes below the gly524 cr position (figure 1a).
gly524 was mutated to a serine and to a leucine to add
increasingly larger side chains that might affect coa binding.
the g524s mutation had little effect on the apparent kinetic
constants for atp. in contrast, the kcat for coa was reduced
by a factor of 2 and, more significantly, the kcat/km was
reduced by nearly 20-fold, resulting in an increase in km of
nearly 9-fold. increasing the size of the side chain at this
position with the g524l mutation reduced activity below
detectable levels. as with the k609a mutation, this enzyme
was analyzed further to determine its ability to catalyze the
adenylation half-reaction (see below).
mutations that targeted the hinge residue. comparing
the structures of adenylate-forming enzymes in both conformations, a change in the backbone torsional angles is
observed at a conserved residue located between the n- and
c-terminal domains (6, 11). two mutations were made to
the hinge residue of the a8 region. a d517p mutation was
made that would increase the rigidity of this hinge, and a
d517g mutation was made to increase the conformational
flexibility of the hinge area. both mutant proteins exhibited
activity (table 1). again, the effects on the atp kinetic
constants were more limited than the effects on coa. the
kcat values changed by only 2-fold. interestingly, the effects
on the km for atp of the d517g mutant suggest that the
c-terminal domain may have difficulty adopting a stable
conformation for the adenylation half-reaction. the kinetics
with coa demonstrate that the proline and glycine mutant
enzymes are able to catalyze the second half-reaction,
however the affinity for coa is reduced in both mutant

figure 1: active site interactions of acs. the structure of the wild-type acs enzyme determined in the presence of propyl-amp and coa
(1pg4) and amino acids that form the active site pocket are shown. (a) the orientation of propyl-amp bound to acs in the thioesterforming conformation illustrates residues that interact that interact with the nucleotide. interactions made to the nucleotide include arg526
and arg515, which interact with the phosphate group. the acetate binding pocket is formed by the three side chains of val310, val386,
and trp414 (shown in green). (b) the coa binding site. the nucleotide of coa binds at the surface of the protein and the pantetheine
group leads in to the adenylate site through a tunnel that is bordered by ala357 and gly524, two residues that were mutated to contain
bulkier side chains. arg584 was positioned to interact with the coa 3′ phosphate. arg194 was oriented away from the phosphate but could
interact through a torsional rotation.

enzymes. the d517p mutant protein has the lowest kcat/km
value observed for coa.
pyrophosphate exchange assay on hinge and inactive
mutants. to examine which half-reaction was more dramatically affected by the mutations, we used the ppi-exchange
assay to further examine several mutant enzymes (table 2).
the k609a mutation showed no activity with the ppiexchange assay, while g524l, d517p, and d517g all
showed activity similar to wild-type acs. of note, the g524l
mutation, which showed no activity using the nadh
consumption assay, can quite readily catalyze the adenylation
half-reaction, demonstrating that the g524l mutation is
disrupting only the second half-reaction, most likely by
occluding the pantetheine tunnel.
substrate specificity studies. the acetate binding pocket
of acs (figure 1a) is formed by three residues, val310,
val386, and trp414 (6). we examined whether we could

alter the substrate specificity of acs by targeted mutation of
these residues. bacterial propionyl-coa synthetases (9)
contain an alanine in place of val386 but retain the other
two acyl pocket residues. we thus constructed a v386a
mutant to attempt to alter the specific activity of acs toward
propionate. the v386a mutation decreased the catalytic
efficiency for acetate and more than doubled its catalytic
efficiency for propionate (table 3). thus, the single mutation
of v386a switches the substrate preference from acetate to
propionate.
analysis of the amino acid binding pockets of nrps
adenylation domains (12, 34) identifies a conserved aspartic
acid that interacts with the substrate r-amino group. the
homologous residue in acs is val310, which forms part of
the acetate binding pocket. we replaced val310 of acs with
 xxxd233xxx  to create an enzyme that might accommodate
the amino acid glycine as an acyl substrate. the v310d

mutation increased the catalytic efficiency for acetate while
the catalytic efficiency of this mutant enzyme for glycine
remained similar to that of wild-type. this mutation is
thus unable to improve the acs activity with an r-amino
acid.
structural determination of wild-type and mutant acs.
to supplement the kinetic analyses and demonstrate that no
large-scale structural rearrangements have occurred, the
proteins were used in crysallographic studies. a new wildtype crystal structure was obtained along with the structures
of the r194a, r584a, r584e, k609a, and v386a mutant
enzymes. suitable crystals of the remaining proteins were
not obtained; because all of the other mutant proteins retain
activity in either the complete or ppi-exchange assay, we
believe that the failure to obtain crystals does not result from
large-scale structural changes or improper protein folding.
the structures, obtained in two crystals forms, all are in the
proposed thioester-forming conformation. the crystals diffract to moderate resolution (table 4), and the molecular
models refined with good geometry and statistics (table 5).
whereas the prior acs crystal structure was determined
with coa and propyl-amp, the current wild-type protein
was incubated with acetate, amp, and coa to attempt to
trap an adenylate-like complex. despite repeated efforts, we
have never been able to crystallize the bacterial acs enzyme
in the adenylate-forming conformation; the yeast acs
enzyme, which exhibits 45% sequence identity with the
bacterial enzyme, was determined in the adenylate-forming
conformation by jogl and tong (16).
the crystals of the mutant proteins were grown in the
presence of propyl-amp and coa. ligand density is shown
in figure 2. as was observed in the original structure (6),
the density of the coa demonstrates that the cofactor is very

well-ordered at the nucleotide; however, the pantetheine
moiety is not well-ordered. in the omit maps generated for
the wild-type (figure 2a) and the k609a (figure 2c)
structures, density is present for the pantetheine although it
is not continuous at a level of 2.5sigma. in the v386a mutant
(figure 2b), there is no significant density for the pantetheine
group at a contour level of 2.5sigma although the coa nucleotide
is well-ordered.
the new wild-type structure superimposes with the original
structure (6) with an rmsd for all cr positions of 0.37 å
over all 637 residues. acetate was present in the active site
and was modeled with one oxygen interacting with the
phosphate oxygen. at the 2.6 å resolution of the wild-type
structure, the precise orientation of the acetate molecule and
the positions of the methyl group and the non-interacting
oxygen atom are unclear.
the mutant structures are all very similar to the original
structure, exhibiting the proposed thioester-forming conformation (figure 3). the rmsd values of the mutants vs the
new wild-type structures for all cr positions (ranging from
a total of 633-638 atoms for the different comparisons)
range from 0.19 to 0.37 å. the density for all mutant residues
is unequivocal. (it should be noted that the solvent exposed
side chain of lys609 of the a10 region is disordered in all
acs structures and thus cannot be used to confirm the k609a
mutation.) the v386a mutant illustrates how the larger
binding pocket is able to accommodate the propyl side chain
(figure 4). the propyl group of the inhibitor bound in the
active site adopts a more extended conformation with the
torsion angle of 172° around the c1-c2 bond. in contrast,
in the wild-type structures, this torsion angle is 32°,
demonstrating that the propyl group adopts a more compact
orientation to fit into the active site.
structures were also determined for the r194a, r584a,
and r584e mutant enzymes. although coa was included
in the crystallization and cryoprotection solutions, no significant density was observed for the coa ligands. the
propyl-amp, in contrast, was well-ordered in all three
mutants (figure 2). although all three mutant enzymes can
bind coa, as evidenced by the activitysalbeit reducedsin
the steady-state kinetics, the affinity of these enzymes is

discussion
we have proposed that the adenylate-forming enzymes
adopt two different conformations to catalyze the two halfreactions. in the domain alternation hypothesis, the members
of this family are believed to adopt the conformation seen
in the crystal structures of  xxxd2901xxx  (12), cbal (11), and yeast
acs (16), among others (15, 17) during the catalysis of the
initial adenylation half-reaction. the c-terminal domain of
these enzymes then rotates by ∼140° around the hinge
residue (at asp517 in acs) to adopt a second conformation

for the second half-reaction. this thioester-forming conformation has been observed in the bacterial acs structures as
well as in a long-chain acyl-coa synthetase structure (35).
that this thioester-forming conformation has now been
observed in a second crystal form of acs strongly suggests
that the conformation is not stabilized by crystal contacts
but rather represents a stable protein conformation that is
likely part of the reaction mechanism.
the biochemical analysis of several mutant enzymes
strongly supports our hypothesis of the conformational
change. in particular, the k609a and g524l mutants that
are located on opposite faces of the mobile c-terminal
domain specifically affect the different half-reactions. both
mutants are completely inactive when assayed for the full

structure/function studies of acs

mutants as well. neighboring protein atoms, including arg191, which interacts with the 5′ diphosphate of coa, are labeled in panels a and

reaction. the k609a mutant, however, is defective in the
adenylation half-reaction while the g524l mutant is able to
catalyze the ppi-exchange assay quite effectively, suggesting
that the defect in the complete reaction occurs in the
thioester-forming half-reaction. gly524, part of the a8
region, is universally conserved in the adenylate-forming
enzymes. in the crystal structures that have been determined
in the adenylate-forming conformation, the gly524 residue
is 25-30 å from the active site. this clearly supports the
need for the c-terminal domain to rotate into the position
observed in the acs structure during the thioester-forming
half-reaction.
additional studies by us and others have also identified
mutations on the c-terminal domains of adenylate-forming
enzymes that specifically affect the individual half-reactions.
mutation of the lys609 homologue in prpe was shown
biochemically to be inhibited for the adenylation half-reaction
while the thioester-forming half-reaction occurred with near
wild-type activity (9). branchini and colleagues have shown

that mutations in lys529 (10) and lys434 (36) of firefly
luciferase can specifically disrupt the adenylation and oxidative decarboxylation half-reactions, respectively. while the
lys529 residue is homologous to lys609 of acs, lys434 of
luciferase is homologous to asn521 of acs. this residue is
located within the a8 region that follows the hinge residue
at asp517. while asn521 of acs does not make any direct
contacts to ligands at the acs active site, the side chain of
this residue is positioned 5.4 å from the ribose ring oxygen.
the lys434 residue in firefly luciferase therefore appears
to play a role in the second half-reaction upon adopting the
conformation observed in the acs structures. for the nrps
adenylation domain subfamily, we have also recently shown
that a poorly conserved residue in the a8 region of the
c-terminal domain can be mutated to specifically affect one
half-reaction (37). arg437 of the self-standing adenylation
domain ente was mutated to an  xxxd233xxx  and assayed
in both the ppi-exchange assay and the complete transfer of
the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate substrate to the pantetheine co-

factor of the acyl-carrier protein of entb. while activity of
the complete reaction was severely compromised, the mutant
was still able to catalyze the adenylation half-reaction. this
arg437 residue precedes the universally conserved glycine
residue (gly524 of acs). together with the results presented
here for g524l of acs, the a8 region that forms a twostranded loop that follows the hinge residue has now been
shown in all three subfamilies of the adenylate-forming
enzymes to be involved specifically in the second halfreaction.
analysis of the original structure of acs (6) demonstrated
that arg194 and arg584 of acs interact with the 3′-phosphate
of coa, while gly524 and ala357 border the pantetheine
tunnel. finally, arg526 was proposed to stablize the thioesterforming conformation by its interactions with glu417 and
the adenylate phosphate. we mutated these residues to
investigate their roles in steady-state kinetics with respect
to atp and coa. with the exception of g524l, which had
no detectable activity, all mutations caused a ∼2-fold
reduction in kcat with no effect on kcat/km with respect to
atp. the kcat values for coa were similarly reduced by ∼2fold and kcat/km values were reduced by 5- to 20-fold,
reflecting a slower rate at limiting coa concentrations. the
reduced affinity for coa demonstrates a role for these
residues in binding coa or stabilizing the thioester-forming
conformation.
while it is always difficult to make any quantitative
conclusions from the presence or absence of ligands in a
crystallographic study, it is worth noting that although coa
was maintained at constant concentration in all of the proteins
studied, no density was observed for the coa molecule in
the three arg mutant enzymes. although the coa molecule
was not observed, it can bind at some level as the enzymes
retain activity. the long-chain acyl-coa synthetase also was
crystallized in the thioester-forming conformation, and, in
that case as well, coa was not modeled into the crystal
structure (35). coa was, however, included in the crystallizations  xxxd1891xxx  mm raising the possibility that for this enzyme,
as for the arg mutants of acs, coa bound with sufficient
occupancy to drive the conformational change, yet not with
a high enough occupancy to be seen in the electron density.
interestingly, arginine residues at 191, 194, and 584, which
all interact with the coa phosphates, are not part of the a1a10 conserved motifs (2) and are not conserved even within
the acyl- and aryl-coa subfamily of the adenylate-forming
enzymes. this raises the possiblity that different residues
may be involved in binding the phosphates of coa or the
peptidyl-carrier protein bound phosphopantetheine.
the d517g and d517p mutants were designed to examine
the hinge residue by increasing flexibility and increasing
rigidity respectively. the d517g mutation reduced the
catalytic efficiency for both substrates and was the only
mutation studied that increased the km for atp. this
mutation may thus have reduced conformational stability and
may be compromised in stably adopting either conformation.
while the catalytic efficiency for d517p for both substrates
was reduced, we note that the apparent km values were
reduced for atp and increased for coa. the phi, psi angles of
the hinge residue asp402 are -72.4°, -15.7° in the cbal
crystal structure (11), which was solved in the adenylateforming conformation. in contrast, the phi, psi angles for
asp517 of acs were -103.6° and -170.9° in the thioester-

structure/function studies of acs

forming conformation. as the backbone phi angle of proline
residues are constrained to -60° ( 20°, the d517p mutant
likely has difficulty adopting the second half-reaction
conformation resulting in a higher km for coa and a lower
km for atp. a similar result was obtained with the
homologue 4-chlorobenzoate-coa ligase. (wu, reger, gulick, and dunaway-mariano, in preparation.)
our attempts at changing the specificity of the acetate
binding pocket of acs were mixed. we were able to improve
the preference of the enzyme for propionate over acetate with
a single mutation of val386 to alanine. the structure of this
mutant enzyme bound to the propyl-amp ligand demonstrates that, while the propyl group adopts a more constrained orientation in the wild-type enzyme, the increase in
the size of the acyl substrate binding pocket allows the
propyl moiety to bind in an extended conformation. the
v386a mutation was one of several mutations made in an
acs homologue from methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus (18). the v388a mutation of the mt- xxxg47xxx 
protein conferred similar improvements in the activity with
propionate; the increased binding pocket, however, was not
sufficiently large to accommodate butyrate as the catalytic
efficiency dropped by a factor of 20 with the additional
methylene group into the acyl substrate. this study further
examined the substrate specificity by mutating additional
residues in the acetate-binding pocket to accommodate such
substrates as butyrate, valerate, and hexanoate. as we had
noted in the comparison of the structures of different
adenylate-forming enzymes (11), the trp414 of acs forms
one wall of the acyl-substrate binding pocket. replacement
of this trp with a gly opened the binding pocket of the mtacs1 enzyme to function with acyl substrates as large as
octanoate (18).
in contrast to the success with the v386a mutation, the
v310d mutation did not confer a catalytic preference for
the amino acid glycine. indeed, the catalytic efficiency with
acetate improved slightly with this mutation. the inability
to utilize glycine as a substrate more efficiently most likely
failed because the pocket was not large enough to accommodate both the larger asp side chain and the larger glycine
substrate. the failure of the v310d mutant to catalyze the
reaction with glycine suggests that further studies are needed
to understand the relationship between substrate and the
substrate-binding pocket.
