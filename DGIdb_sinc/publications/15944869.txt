paradoxical effect of sibutramine
on autonomic cardiovascular regulation
in obese hypertensive patients
sibutramine and blood pressure

■ abstract background sibutramine, a serotonin and  xxxg2148xxx  blocker, is a
common adjunctive obesity treatment. acute studies in healthy subjects suggested that an inhibitory
central nervous mechanism might
attenuate the peripheral stimulatory effect on the sympathetic nervous system. this notion has not
been tested in overweight and
obese patients. methods we conducted a randomized, controlled
clinical study in hypertensive patients with bmi ≥ 27 to < 40 kg/m2.
after 4 week placebo run-in period
patients were randomized to four
different antihypertensive treatments or placebo. after 4 weeks of
antihypertensive therapy, patients
were additionally treated with
sibutramine 15 mg o. d. for 3
months. patients underwent cardiovascular autonomic reflex testing and a graded head-up tilt test at
the end of each phase. results
mean body weight decreased from
98.5 ± 4 to 94.7 ± 4 kg (p < 0.05) between end of placebo run-in and
end of sibutramine treatment.

introduction
one third of the adult population in the united states is
obese and has an increased cardiovascular risk [18, 23,
24]. since most patients do not achieve and maintain
sufficient weight loss with diet and exercise alone, a

supine blood pressure was
154 ± 3/80 ± 2, 145 ± 3/76 ± 2 and
150 ± 3/79 ± 2 mmhg at the end of
placebo run-in, after antihypertensive titration (ns) and end of sibutramine treatment (ns), respectively. blood pressure was affected
similarly during head up tilt testing. the systolic blood pressure response to cold pressor testing was
diminished with sibutramine
(p < 0.01). sibutramine decreased
low frequency systolic blood pressure oscillations in the supine position (p < 0.01). conclusions resting
blood pressure tends to increase
with sibutramine, whereas blood
pressure during sympathetic stimulation and low frequency blood
pressure oscillations are decreased.
these paradoxical changes are consistent with previous studies in
healthy subjects and suggest a
combination of peripheral and
central nervous system mechanisms.

combination of diet and exercise with anti-obesity medications may be useful [30]. the serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor sibutramine is a widely used
anti-obesity drug [6, 15, 19]. sibutramine mediates increased satiety, although a mild increase in energy expenditure may also contribute to weight loss [14, 33].
indeed, when applied locally to peripheral tissues, nor-

epinephrine transporter blockade increases norepinephrine overflow [17]. consequently, there have been
concerns that norepinephrine uptake inhibition with
sibutramine could exacerbate arterial hypertension.
however, systemically, the actions of sibutramine are
more complicated. in the central nervous system,  xxxg2148xxx  blockade attenuates sympathetic
outflow through activation of alpha-2 adrenoreceptors
[8]. the systemic application of any norepinephrine uptake-inhibiting drug is associated with complex and opposing cardiovascular effects [4, 10, 27, 32]. for example,
in normal weight and normotensive young subjects,
sibutramine acutely increases resting blood pressure.
yet, sibutramine ingestion over a few days profoundly
attenuates the pressor response to sympathetic stimuli
through a “clonidine like” sympatholytic effect [4]. the
complex interaction of peripheral and central nervous
mechanisms makes predicting the cardiovascular response to sibutramine in patients with altered sympathetic activity, such as obese hypertensives, difficult
[11]. therefore, we tested the effect of sibutramine on
autonomic cardiovascular regulation in obese hypertensive patients.

methods
■ subjects
the present study was part of a monocentric drug trial in obese hypertensive patients. we recruited men and women between the ages
of 18–70 years with a body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2 and < 40 kg/m2. the
patients had arterial hypertension with a systolic blood pressure
≥ 140 mm hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm hg in the absence of antihypertensive therapy. treated hypertensive patients with
two or less antihypertensive medications were also eligible if they
were willing and able to discontinue treatment. patients with blood
pressure above 200/110 mm hg, with secondary forms of arterial hypertension, secondary forms of obesity, heart failure (nyha iii-iv),
cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, with a weight loss of 3
kg or more in the preceding three months, diabetes mellitus, or any
contraindications to the study medications were not included in the
study.written informed consent was obtained before study entry. the
institutional review board approved all studies.
■ protocol
after a four week single-blinded placebo run-in period, patients were
randomized to four different antihypertensive treatments or to
placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion in a double blinded fashion. antihypertensive therapy was initiated and stabilized during a four-week phase.
the daily doses of the antihypertensive agents were 200 mg metoprolol, 240 mg verapamil (extended release), 2 mg  xxxd3409xxx , or 25 mg
hydrochlorothiazide. after this phase, all patients were treated with
sibutramine 15 mg per day for a 12-week period on top of the antihypertensive medication or on top of placebo. all patients received individual dietary counseling. we determined autonomic cardiovascular regulation with a series of autonomic reflex tests and a graded
head-up tilt test at the end of the placebo run-in phase, at the end of
the antihypertensive stabilization period, and again after the additional 12-week sibutramine treatment. testing was conducted after an
overnight fast.

■ instrumentation
respiration, transthoracic bioimpedance, and electrocardiogram
(ecg) were measured continuously (cardioscreen, medis gmbh).
beat-by-beat blood pressure (finapres, ohmeda) and brachial arterial blood pressure (dinamap, critikon) were determined.
■ autonomic reflex testing and head-up tilt testing
the sinus arrhythmia ratio (sa ratio) was calculated as the ratio of
the longest to the shortest rr interval during 1 of 10 controlled
breathing loops (5-s inhalation and 5-s exhalation). patients performed a valsalva maneuver (40 mm hg pressure for 15 s). we determined responses to isometric handgrip (30 % maximum contraction
for 3 minutes) and cold pressor testing (1 minute immersion of the
hand in ice water). after completion of autonomic reflex testing, subjects recovered for at least 30 minutes in the supine position. then,
subjects were gradually tilted upright by 15° every three minutes until 75° head up tilt (hut) was reached. the subjects remained at 75°
hut for additional 10 minutes or until presyncopal symptoms occurred.
■ spectral analysis and baroreflex sensitivity
heart rate and blood pressure variability were determined using
standard techniques [1, 21]. spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity was
assessed using the sequence technique and cross-spectral analysis [3,
7, 31].
■ statistics
all data are expressed as mean ± sem. intraindividual differences
were compared by one way anova testing for repeated measures.

results
seventeen patients (8 men, 9 women, 53 ± 4 years, bmi
35 ± 1.2 kg/m2, waist-to-hip ratio 0.91) completed autonomic reflex testing and a head-up tilt test after placebo
run-in, after antihypertensive stabilization, and again
after sibutramine treatment on top of the antihypertensive treatment. body weight was 98.5 ± 4 kg at the end of
placebo run-in, 98.2 ± 4 kg after antihypertensive stabilization, and 94.7 ± 4 kg (p < 0.05 compared with run-in)
after sibutramine treatment. body mass index was
34.2 ± 0.8 kg/m2 at the end of placebo run-in, 34.1 ± 0.9
kg/m2 after antihypertensive stabilization, and 32.5 ± 1
kg/m2 (p < 0.001 compared with run-in) after sibutramine treatment.
supine blood pressure was 154 ± 3/80 ± 2 mm hg at
the end of the placebo run-in period, 145 ± 3/76 ± 2 mm
hg (ns compared with run-in) after antihypertensive
treatment, and 150 ± 3/79 ± 2 mm hg (ns compared with
run-in) at the end of the additional sibutramine treatment.after standing 3 min at 75°,systolic blood pressure
was 153 ± 3/87 ± 3 mm hg at the end of the placebo runin period, 145 ± 4/81 ± 2 mm hg after antihypertensive
treatment and 153 ± 3/88 ± 2 mm hg at the end of the additional sibutramine treatment. a similar pattern was

evident for systolic and diastolic blood pressure when
we analyzed only patients who were treated with active
antihypertensive therapy (fig. 1a and b). on average,
heart rate during the head up tilt test did not change
with antihypertensive treatment (fig. 1c). sibutramine
treatment increased heart rate particularly in the upright position. supine heart rate was 63 ± 2 bpm at the
end of the placebo run-in period, 60 ± 2 bpm after antihypertensive treatment, and 67 ± 2 bpm at the end of the
sibutramine treatment. the number of subjects was too
few to allow for a definitive statistical comparison between different antihypertensive treatment groups.
respiratory sinus arrhythmia ratio was similar with
treatment and sibutramine (table 1). the decrease in
systolic blood pressure during phase ii of the valsalva
maneuver was more pronounced with sibutramine compared to placebo run-in (p < 0.05). the blood pressure
overshoot during phase iv and the valsalva ratio were
similar during each visit. the increase in systolic blood
pressure during handgrip testing was slightly reduced
with the combination of combined antihypertensive and
sibutramine treatment. the systolic blood pressure response to cold pressor testing was diminished with sibutramine (fig. 2).
in the supine position and with head-up tilt test,
heart rate variability was similar with sibutramine, compared to placebo (table 2). supine spontaneous baroreflex variability was similar during placebo run-in, antihypertensive titration, and sibutramine treatment.
sibutramine decreased low frequency systolic blood
pressure oscillations in the supine position (fig. 3).

discussion
we tested the effect of the widely used anti-obesity drug
sibutramine on cardiovascular regulation at rest and
during sympathetic stimulation in obese hypertensive
patients. blood pressure increased by 5/3 mm hg with
combined antihypertensive treatment and sibutramine
compared with sole antihypertensive treatment. however, blood pressure with combined antihypertensive
treatment and sibutramine was not increased compared

with the baseline level. in contrast, the pressor response
to some sympathetic stimuli was attenuated with sibutramine. in the supine position, sibutramine decreased
blood pressure variability in the low frequency range.
furthermore, sibutramine increased heart rate, particularly in the upright position. qualitatively similar cardiovascular responses to sibutramine have been observed in a previous study in healthy young subjects [4].
the cardiovascular effects of sibutramine are mainly
explained by  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition. if
norepinephrine uptake were reduced only in peripheral
tissues, one would expect an increase in synaptic norepinephrine and a substantial increase in blood pressure.
instead, we found a modest increase in systolic blood
pressure and a minimal increase in diastolic blood pressure. decreased  xxxg2148xxx  function
may not be associated with a major increase in blood
pressure in the long term. this notion is supported by
observations in patients who are born with decreased
 xxxg2148xxx  function. patients with familial  xxxg2148xxx  deficiency do not
have arterial hypertension [28]. furthermore, if norepinephrine uptake were reduced only in peripheral tissues, one would expect to see an exacerbation of the
pressor response to sympathetic stimulation. instead,
sibutramine attenuated the pressor response to cold
pressor and handgrip testing in the present study and in
a previous study in young, normal weight subjects [4].
together, these findings suggest that peripheral effects
of  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition, which tends
to increase blood pressure, are apparently compensated
for in part by other mechanisms.
sibutramine inhibits norepinephrine uptake in peripheral tissues and in the brain. one mechanism that
could attenuate the pressor response to sibutramine is a
central sympatholytic effect. indeed, sibutramine and

other norepinephrine transport inhibitors acutely reduce low frequency systolic blood pressure oscillations
(“mayer-waves”) [4, 27, 32]. mayer waves are related to
oscillations in sympathetic vasomotor discharge that
are generated in the central nervous system [25]. microneurography provides a more direct measure of sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system. using
this methodology, the norepinephrine transport inhibitors desipramine and  xxxd3089xxx  were shown to suppress sympathetic outflow in humans [10, 32]. finally,
short-term  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition decreases supine plasma norepinephrine concentrations
( xxxd3089xxx  and sibutramine) [4, 5] and whole body norepinephrine spillover (desipramine) [10]. animal studies suggest that the sympatholytic effect is mediated
through central nervous alpha-2 adrenoreceptors,
which, therefore, resembles clonidine-induced sympathetic inhibition [8]. our study suggests that the effect of
 xxxg2148xxx  inhibition on autonomic
cardiovascular regulation is at least in part sustained
with long-term treatment. the sympatholytic effect is
not evenly distributed throughout the body. renal norepinephrine spillover decreases while cardiac norepinephrine spillover increases [10]. the change in the distribution of sympathetic activity may explain the
sustained heart rate increase with sibutramine.
sibutramine’s effects on blood pressure regulation in
the chronic treatment of obese patients differ from its
acute application in normal-weight subjects. with
short-term sibutramine application in healthy subjects,
resting blood pressure increases markedly whereas
blood pressure during sympathetic stimulation decreases [4, 27, 32]. we recently analyzed blood pressure
responses to sibutramine in a larger set of patients who
participated in placebo-controlled trials. of these patients, 966 were randomized to sibutramine and 370
were randomized to placebo. systolic blood pressure did
not change with either intervention over a 48-week
period (–0.1 ± 15.5 mm hg with sibutramine,
–0.2 ± 15.2 mm hg with placebo, p = 0.9). the change in
diastolic blood pressure over the 48-week period was
0.3 ± 9.5 mm hg with sibutramine and –0.8 ± 9.2 mm hg
with placebo (p = 0.049). the response was not exacerbated in hypertensive patients [16]. body weight reduction with chronic treatment is an obvious difference
between acute and long-term sibutramine application.
body weight reduction is known to decrease blood pressure [2, 20, 26]. the sibutramine induced weight loss
may have offset the direct effect of sibutramine on resting blood pressure. chronic reduction in renal sympathetic activity with  xxxg2148xxx  inhibition [10] may also be contributory.we speculate that the
sympatholytic “clonidine-like” effects of sibutramine on

the sympathetic nervous system might be more prominent in obese patients than in young normal weight subjects. in a large subgroup of obese patients, sympathetic
activity is increased even at rest [11, 13].
the major limitations of our study are that we did not
determine plasma catecholamine concentrations and
that we did not have a control group that lost weight with
a different intervention. therefore, we cannot exclude
the possibility that some of the cardiovascular autonomic changes with sibutramine were related to the
weight loss [12] or a time effect rather than to a specific
effect of sibutramine. however, most of the cardiovascular responses with sibutramine, such as attenuation of
the cold pressor response and reduction in low frequency systolic blood pressure oscillations, resembled
responses in acute studies with various norepinephrine
transporter inhibitors including sibutramine [4, 27, 32].
we conclude that chronic sibutramine treatment elicits complex changes in cardiovascular autonomic regulation in obese hypertensive patients. resting blood
pressure may increase slightly with sibutramine,
whereas blood pressure during sympathetic stimulation
is decreased. these paradoxical changes are probably
explained by a combination of peripheral and central
nervous system (“clonidine-like”) mechanisms. we propose that blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored in patients who are treated with any  xxxg2148xxx  inhibitor. upright heart rate should also
be determined, in particular in patients who report orthostatic symptoms. in obese hypertensive patients,
sibutramine may have to be combined with antihypertensive medications. in acute studies, the increase in
heart rate and blood pressure with sibutramine was
completely reversed with beta adrenoreceptor blockade
[4]. beta-adrenoreceptor blockade also diminished resting energy expenditure, which may attenuate weight loss
[4]. nonetheless, in chronic studies, sibutramine reduced body weight in obese hypertensive patients
treated with a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker [29]. in a
subsequent study, addition of low-dose metoprolol
(25 mg/day) to sibutramine therapy decreased the frequency and severity of side effects including hypertension and palpitations [9]. given the beneficial effect of
renin-angiotensin inhibitors on the risk for type-2 diabetes,  xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors
and sibutramine might be another rational combination
therapy [22]. whether or not one combination therapy
is any better than another combination therapy is not
known. further studies are needed.
