the anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd2423xxx  in animal experiments.  the authors investigated the anti-inflammatory actions of  xxxd2423xxx  using a battery of tests: in the rat paw oedema test induced by five different inciters, in the capillary permeability test, and in measuring the  xxxg562xxx  (il-8) production and superoxide dismutase (sod) activity. the findings in these studies show that  xxxd2423xxx  inhibits rat paw oedema, suppresses capillary permeability, reduces il-8 production and increases sod activity in the acetic-acid-induced inflammatory state. these results would seem to provide a clear rationale for exploring the usefulness of  xxxd2423xxx  in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.
