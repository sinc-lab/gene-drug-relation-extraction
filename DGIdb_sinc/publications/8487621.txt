age-related changes in a6 desaturation of [1-1~]a- xxxd2490xxx  and [1j4c]linoleic acid and in a5 desaturation of
[2-14c]dihom~y-iinolenic acid were studied in liver microsomes from wistar male rats at various ages ranging from
1.5 to 24 moll. desaturase activities were expressed both
as specific activity of liver microsomes and as the capacity of whole fiver to desaturate by taking into account the
total amount of liver microsomal protein. a6 desaturation
of a- xxxd2490xxx  increased from 1.5 to 3 mon and then
decreased linearly up to 24 mon to reach the same desaturation capacity of fiver measured at 1.5 mon. the capacity
of fiver to desaturate linoleic acid increased up to 6 mon
and then remained constant, whereas microsomal specific
activity was equal at 1.5 and 24 mon of age. the capacity
of fiver to convert dihomo-y-finolenic acid to arachidonlc
acid by a5 desaturation decreased markedly from 1.5 to
3 mon. it then increased to reach, at 24 mon, the same level
as that observed at 1.5 mon. age-related changes in the
fatty acid composition of liver microsomal phospholipids
at the seven time points studied and of erythrocyte lipids
at 1.5 and 24 molt were consistent with the variations in
desaturation capacity of fiver. in particular, arachidonic
acid content in old rats was slightly higher than in young
rats whereas contents in linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids
varied little throughout the life span. the results suggest
that, in liver, the activity of desaturases may be regulated
in the course of aging to maintain a constant level of

lipids 28, 291-297 {1993).

 xxxd208xxx  (20:4n-6} and docosabex~enoic acid
(22:6n-3), which are the major polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
of phospholipids in mammalian cells, are formed, principally in fiver, from the precursors linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and alinolenic acid (18:3n-3), respectively the essentiality of these
precursors depends on their capacity to be a6 desaturated
and then transformed to 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 by chain
elongation and a5 desaturation (20:4n-6), and by another
elongation and a4 desaturation (22:6n-3). desaturation and
elongation are alternative reactions, but the desaturation
processes are rate-limiting whereas the elongation steps are
rapid (1-3}. the hepatic a6 desaturas~ which is the regulatory enzyme in the pathway involved in the biosynthesis
of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  of the n-6 and n-3 series, converts 18:2n-6 to y-finolenic acid (18:3n-6) and 18:3n-3 to
stearidonic acid {18:4n-3). another important enzym~ the
a5 desatttras~ is responsible for the biosynthesis of the major precursors of eicosanoids of series 2 and 3, i.e, 20:4n-6
from dihomc~y- xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd1886xxx } and eicosapentaenoic
acid (20:5n-3) from eicosatetraenoic acid (20:4n-3}. it also controls the balance between the precursors of eicosanoids of

series 1 and 2 compounds ( xxxd1886xxx  and 20:4n-6, respective
ly), which have contrasting actions.

several studies have shown that the in vitro fatty acid
desaturase activities in fiver microsomes are modified with
aging. peluffo and brenner (4) showed that, in rat fiver, a6
desaturation of 18:2n~ and 18:3n-3 was decreased at 12 mon
of ag~ when compared to desaturation at 3 morl bordoni
e t al (5) demonstrated that the a6 desaturase activity
toward 18:2n-6 decreased with the age of rats (between 1
and 22 mon}. a linear correlation was proposed between activity and ag~ in another study, these authors showed that
the decrease in the a6 desaturation of 18:3n-3 activity began
later than did desaturation of 18:2n-6 (6}. these results were
obtained on wistar rats fed a chow diet throughout their
life choi et al (7) found a significant agedependent decrease
in the a6 desaturation activity of 18:2n-6 between young
{3-week~)ld} and adult (8-month-old) rats, but they did not
confirm their results in a second study {8}. recently, biagi
et rd (9) showed that the a6 desaturation rate of 18:2n-6 in
wistar rats of 12 mon was only 44% of that found in young
animals (3-month~ld) after 1 mon of a semisynthetic diet
containing  xxxd3230xxx  the decrease with age in the rate
of 18:3n-3 a6 desaturation was much less. bourre et ed {10)
found a 40% decrease in the a6 desaturation of 18:2n-6 in
livers of mice between 4 and 17 mo~ in studies using rat
fiver microsomes, the changes observed in the fatty acid
compositions generally correlated with the impairment of
a6 desaturation, suggesting a possible effect of age on the
biosynthesis of prostaglandins and their metabofites.
these previous studies dealt only with a6 desaturation
of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 and often were limited to few time
points n o study involved a5 desaturatiorlmoreover, results
were expressed only as specificactivity of a6 desaturation
in fivermicrosomes. the a6 desaturation capacity of whole
fiver was not determinecl
w e therefore undertook a more complete survey of the
evolution with age of a6 and a5 desaturation in rat fiver.
for this purpose, wistar rats were fed the same balanced
semisynthetic diet during their lifesparl the a6 desaturation of 18:2n-6 and of 18:3n-3 and the a5 desaturation of
 xxxd1886xxx  were determined in fivermicrosomes at seven time
points ranging from 1.5 to 24 mon. results were expressed
both as specific activity and as total capacity of the fiver
to desatumte the fatty acid composition of fiver microsomal
phosphofipids was also determined to evaluate whether
changes (if any) in the fatty acid profiles with age could be
accounted for by modlfi"cations in desaturation specific activity or capacity. data dealing with adult rats (3, 6, 9 mon
of age) were reported in a preliminary study {11). the pr~
sent paper describes the complete study carried out on
young, adult and old rats.

respectively (n-6/n-3 rati(~ 5.0). the fatty acid composition
of the diet lipids is shown in table 1. the diet was stored
at 4-6~ and rats were fed ad libitum. rats were maintained on this diet up to 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 mon
of age at the laboratoire de nutrition et s~curit~ alimentaire (inra, jouy en josas, france). for the 1.5 mort
study, only one group of six rats was used. for the other
six ages (3 to 24 mon), two groups of three rats were used
at two different periods (generally summer and winter) of
the same year or of two different years in order to minimize the effect of season on the desaturation rate (4).
chemicals. [1-14c]linoleic acid (58 mci]mmol, 99%
radiochemical purity) was purchased from cea (gif sur
yvette, france). [1-14c]a-linoleuicacid and [2-~4c]dihomoy- xxxd2490xxx  (56 mci]mmol, radiochemieal purity, 96%)
were purchased from the amersham radiochemical centre (amersham, united kingdom). each substrate was
diluted in ethanol with unlabelled fatty acid to a specific
activity of 10 mci/mmol. coenzymes, biochemicals and
other chemicals were purchased from sigma chemical ca
(st. louis, mo).
preparation of rnnicrosornal fractions. all experiments
were performed starting  xxxd2274xxx :30 a.m. to avoid any circadian variation in desaturase activity (12) and on nightfed animals in order to obtain the maximum desaturation
activity (2).
the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(6 mg per 100 g of body weight). they were exsanguinated
by drawing blood from the abdominal aort~ the liver was
excised, rinsed with ice-cold saline solution and weighed.
about 3.5 g of liver were homogenized at 4~ in a potterelvejhem homogenizer with 6 vol of 0.25 m sucrose in 0.05
m buffer phosphate (ph 7.4). the homogenate was centrifuged at 13000 â€¢ g (model j-21b centrifuge, j-21 rotor,
beckman, lyon, france) for 20 rain to sediment ceil fragments, mitochondria and nuclei. the supernatant was
recentrifuged (l8-55 ultracentrifuge, ti 60 rotor, beckman) at 105000 x g for 60 min, and the microsomal pellet
was resuspended in 0.4 ml of supernatant and 0.8 ml of
sucrose buffer. the amount of microsomal protein was
determined by the method of layne (13).
desaturation assays. incubations were performed in
open flasks at 37~ for 15 rain using a shaker water bath
with a total volume of 2.1 ml incubation medium containing 72 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, 4.8 mm mgc12,
0.5 mm  xxxd1739xxx , 3.6 mm  xxxd83xxx ,
1.2 mm  xxxd532xxx  phosphate and 120 nmoi, 120 nmol and 80 nmoi of labelled
18:3n-3, 18:2n-6 and  xxxd1886xxx  (30 ~l of ethanolic solution),
i.e., about 57, 57 and 38 ~m, respectively. at time 0, 5 mg
of microsomal protein was added to the incubation
medium. incubations were stopped after 15 rain by adding 15 ml of chloroform]methanol (1:1, vofvol). lipids
were transmethylated in methanolic bf 3 according to
slover and lanza (14).
the substrate and desaturation product were separated
by high-performance liquid chromatography as described
by narce et al (15), using a waters chromatograph model
6000a and a model 401 differential refractometer (walipids, vol. 28, no. 4 (1993)

ters associates, milford, ma). the 250 â€¢ 4 mm i.d. column packed with lichrospher 100 rp-18 (4 ~ particles),
protected by a lichrosorb rp-18 precolumn, was purchased from merck (darmstadt, germany}. the fatty acid
methyl esters were collected at the detector outlet, and
their radioactivity was measured directly in the solvent
by liquid scintillation counting with a packard model a
3000cd spectrometer (packard instruments, rungis,
france). the conditions permitted a good separation of
the different polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters,
and the desaturation product was eluted before its
substrat~ avoiding its contamination by the highly
radioactive substrate.
specific activity was expressed as pmol of radioactive
fatty acid converted to desaturation product per rain and
per mg microsomal protein. for each animal, the desaturation capacity of whole liver was calculated by taking into
account the total amount of microsomal protein in liver.
it was expressed as nmol of substrate converted per min
and per whole liver.
preparation oferythrocytes. erythrocytes were isolated
from blood according to rao et al (16). blood was collected
from the abdominal aorta using heparin mixed with buffered saline solution ( xxxg2020xxx , 141 ram; kc1, 10 mm;
mgc12, 1 mm; cac12, 1.3 mm; nah2po4, 5 mm) in the
proportion 1:5 (vol]vol). the suspension was gently shaken
and centrifuged at 2500-3000 â€¢ g for 7 min. the pellet
was resuspended in the saline solution and recentrifuged. the operation was repeated three times.
fatty acid analysis. lipids from an aliquot of liver
microsomes and from the remaining pellet containing
erythrocytes were extracted with dimethoxymethane]methanol (4:1, vol/vol) according to delsal (17). microsomal phospholipids were obtained by silicic acid column
chromatography according to hirsch and ahrens (18).  xxxd2154xxx  were transmethylated (14), and the fatty acid
methyl esters were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography using a packard model 417 chromatograph equipped with a laboratory made 30 m â€¢ 0.3 mm i.d. glass
capillary column coated with carbowax 20m. analyses

age-related changes in desaturation activity
were carried out at 180~ at a nitrogen flow rate of 1
ml/min. the esters were detected with a flame-ionization
detector. peak areas were measured using a delsi model
enica 21 c o m p u t i n g integrator (delsi instruments,
suresnes, france). results are expressed as mole % of total
f a t t y acids of the lipid fraction.
statistical analysis. the results are expressed as means
+_sd of six rats (1.5 mon) or of three rats in two different
groups (3 to 24 mon). the graphs were traced using the
means of the six rats for each age. after analysis of variance using the fischer multiple range test, means were
compared in the seven groups of age according to the least
significant difference and classified in decreasing order.
means assigned different superscript letters were significantly different (p < 0.05). the f a t t y acid compositions
of erythrocyte lipids and liver microsomal phospholipids
were compared at 1.5 and 24 mon by means of student's

t-test.
results
b o d y weights, liver weights and liver microsomal protein
concentrations at the seven time points studied are
reported in table 2. b o d y weight increased from 1.5 to 9
mon without any great difference between the two groups
of three rats at 3, 6 and 9 mon of age. however, for the
subsequent time points (12, 18 and 24 mon), body weight
varied greatly between the two groups at each age~ liver
weights also increased with age from 1.5 to 9 mon but
more slowly than did body weights. as a consequence, the
ratio of liver weight to body weight decreased from 1.5
to 6 mon. in the older rats, liver weight increased proportionally to body weight so that the liver weight/body
weight ratio remained constant. the microsomal protein
concentration was relatively constant, even in the two different groups (of the same age) of old rats so t h a t the
rnicrosomal protein content of whole liver followed roughly
the increase in liver weight.
the age-related specific activity of liver microsomes and
capacity of whole liver to convert a- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3n-3)

to stearidonic acid (18:4n-3) by a6 desaturation are
reported in figure i. both specific activity and liver
capacity increased from 1.5 to 3 mon, but the latter increased more (2.8-fold)than did the former (1.3-fold).after
3 mon, the two parameters decreased with age but the
specific activity decreased more rapidly than did liver
capacity. at 24 mon, the specific activity of a6 desaturation of 18:3n-3 was 60% of that observed at 1.5 mon, while
the liver capacity had returned to the initial level.
the parameters for the a6 desaturation of linoleic acid
(18:2n-6) to 7-1inolenic acid (18:3n-6) are reported in figure
2. the specific activity of microsomes showed some variations with age, with relatively large differences occurring
between groups at each age. however, the desaturation
rate remained essentially constant between 1.5 and 24
mon. paralleling the increase in total microsomal protein
content, the liver capacity to desaturate linoleic acid increased from 1.5 to 6 mon, reaching a plateau between 6
and 24 mon. a t 24 mon, the capacity was twice t h a t
measured at 1.5 mon.
the age-related specific activity of liver microsomes and
the capacity of whole liver to convert dihomo-7-1inolenic
acid ( xxxd1886xxx ) to  xxxd208xxx  (20:4n-6) by a5 desaturation are reported in figure 3. the specific activity decreased markedly (6.5-fold) between 1.5 and 3 mon and
then increased very slightly up to 24 mon to reach a value
2.5-fold lower than t h a t at the earliest age studied. the
capacity of the liver to desaturate also decreased between
1.5 and 3 mon but more slowly (2.4-fold) than did specific
activity. from then on it increased, and, at 24 mon, the
capacity of the liver to desaturate  xxxd1886xxx  to 20:4n-6 was
not significantly different from t h a t found at 1.5 mon.
figure 4 illustrates the age-related percentages of
linoleic acid, of  xxxd208xxx , its product of a6 and a5
desaturations, and of docosahexaenoic acid in liver
microsomal phospholipids. the percentage of 18:2n-6 did
not change between 1.5 and 24 mon. the percentage of
20:4n-6 increased slightly, with some variations, reaching
a higher value at 24 mon (32.2%) than at 1.5 mon (26.2%).
consequently, the 20:4/18:2 ratio increased from 3.4 (1.5

discussion

t h e aims of this s t u d y were to investigate age-related
changes in various desaturase activities of r a t liver
microsomes and to determine if these changes in t u r n induced alterations in the phospholipid f a t t y acid composition of erythrocytes and liver microsomes. the latter supp o r t the different desaturases and their associated proteins, and the former are rich in  xxxd208xxx .
our d a t a on the effects of age on a6 desaturation rates
with 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 as substrates conflict with those
reported by hrelia e t al. (6). these authors observed a
decrease of 55% in the specific activity of a6 desaturase
for 18:2n-6 between 1 m o n and 22 or 25 mon. however,
the a6 desaturation rate of 18:3n-3, much higher t h a n t h a t
of 18:2n-6 at all ages, decreased from the end of 12 m o n
until 25 mon. we observed a pronounced decrease in the
a6 desaturation of 18:3n-3 between 9 and 24 mon, whereas
the a6 desaturation of 18:2n-6 was modified little through-

fig. 3. age-related changes in a5 desaturatiou of dihomo-y-linolenic
acid (20:3n~6) in liver micrceomes expressed both as specific activit y of liver microsomes (a) and activity of whole liver or capacity
(]3). figures are means ___sdobtained from one group of six rats (1.5
mon) or two groups of three rats at all other ages. after analysis
of variance using the fisher multiple range test, means of the six
rats for each age were compared to the least significant difference
and classified in decreasing order. means assigned different
superscript letters were significantly different (p< 0.05). prot,

out the fife span. moreover, the 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 a6
desaturation specific activities we observed at 1.5 mon
(c~ 100 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein) were similar.
several differences between the experimental conditions
used may in p a r t explain these discrepancies. hrelia e t
al. (6) used rats fed a chow diet throughout their fife span
and the fiver microsomal preparations were frozen until
use. bourre e t al. (10) also found a decrease with aging
in a6 desaturation, b u t mice were used and desaturation
measurements were done on liver homogenates. in our experiments, rats received a semisynthetic diet, and incubations were done immediately using fresh microsomes. in
addition, we used a higher substrate concentration (57 ~m
instead of 40/~m used by hrelia e t al. (6)).
the differences in desaturation activities we observed
between the two series of three animals, between 3 and
24 mon, were due in part to seasonal variations, as was
previously shown for 6-month-old rats (11). to compensate for the seasonal variations of desaturation (4), we
used two groups of animals at two different periods of the

year. however, in the course of the experiment, another
factor of variation appeared between the two groups: the
fiver weight in relation to the body weight. the desaturation rates varied in reverse order to the liver weight. so
in 2-month-old rats, the a m o u n t of 18:2n-6 transformed by a6 desaturation was found equal to 71 _ 11 and
93 +_ 4 pmol]min/mg microsomal protein in liver weighing
18.2 and 12.4 g, respectively. at certain ages, the effects
of season and fiver weight added and caused great variations between groups. at other ages, they compensated
and the deviations were low. b u t within each group the
variations between animals were not great.
no s t u d y has yet been reported on the age-related
changes in a5 desaturase activity. only d a t a relative to
the  xxxd1886xxx /20:4n-6 ratio in liver lipids as a function of age
have been reported, suggesting depressed a5 desaturase
activity (19) or, on the contrary, a possible increase of this
activity (20). our results demonstrate t h a t the specific a5
desaturase activity toward  xxxd1886xxx  was 5.5 times higher
than the a6 desaturase activity toward 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3
at 1.5 mon.
the f a t t y acid composition of fiver microsomal phosphofipids and erythrocyte lipids reflected desaturation activities. the constant levels of 18:2n-6 and 20:4n-6 in fiver
microsomes after 3 mon are in agreement with the unchanged desaturation capacity of fiver relative to 18:2n-6
and the increased capacity relative to  xxxd1886xxx  in adult and
aged animals. despite some variations in desaturation activities, the 20:4n-6/18:2n-6 ratio varied little with age (3.4
to 3.8) except at 12 mon (4.5). these ratios were consist e n t with the observed changes in b o t h a6 and a5 desaturation capacities. the changes in desaturation rates
associated with the development of animals occur principally in the early stages of fife
the capacity of liver to convert 18:3n-3 to 18:4n-3 by
a6 desaturation decreased with age, whereas the level of
22:6n-3 in microsomal phosphofipids increased between
3 and 24 mon. an explanation for this may be t h a t the
decrease in a6 desaturase could be compensated for by
