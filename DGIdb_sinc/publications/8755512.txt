hiv in human monocytes by thalidomide (13). further delineation of the inhibitory mechanism has been hampered, in
large part, by the relatively low'potency of the drug with an ic50
between 10 and 100 ,um for  xxxg2296xxx  inhibition (12, 13).
in an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
immunomodulation by thalidomide in general and the molecular target responsible for its inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  in particular,
we have synthesized an active photoaffinity label derived from
the drug. using this photoaffinity label, we detected a pair of
proteins that specifically bind to thalidomide. these thalidomide-binding proteins have been identified as isoforms of
a1-acid glycoprotein (agp), indicating a potential role for
agp as a mediator of the drug's immunomodulatory effect.

in addition to its well known sedative and
abstract
teratogenic effects, thalidomide also possesses potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities, being most
effective against leprosy and chronic graft-versus-host disease. the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide has been
ascribed to the selective inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  ai
from monocytes. the molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide remains unknown. to elucidate this mechanism, we synthesized an active photoaffinity
label of thalidomide as a probe to identify the molecular target
of the drug. using the probe, we specifically labeled a pair of
proteins of 43-45 kda with high acidity from bovine thymus
extract. purification of these proteins and partial peptide
sequence determination revealed them to be al-acid glycoprotein (agp). we show that the binding of thalidomide photoaffinity label to authentic human agp is competed with both
thalidomide and the nonradioactive photoaffinity label at
concentrations comparable to those required for inhibition of
production oftumor necrosis factor a from human monocytes,
suggesting that agp may be involved in the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide.

materials and methods
materials. fresh calf thymi were obtained from research 87
(medford, ma). human agp and clostridium perfringens
neuraminidase were from sigma. mouse anti-human  xxxg2296xxx 
monoclonal antibodies used for elisa were from pharmingen. carboxymethyl sepharose was from pharmacia. cbzglutamine was purchased from bachem. 125i-labeled and unlabeled azidoiodophenylpropionic acid succinimidyl ester were
purchased from a. ruoho (university of wisconsin school of
medicine, madison, wi). nmr solvents were from cambridge
isotope laboratories (cambridge, ma). propranolol and  xxxd123xxx  were from research biochemicals international. all
other chemicals were purchased from aldrich.
synthesis ofthalidomide analogs. thalidomide and most of
its analogs were synthesized according to procedures reported
previously (fig. 1). all compounds except the photoaffinity
label were characterized by 1h nmr and mass spectrometry.

thalidomide has a relatively simple chemical architecture (fig.
1), but exhibits a multitude of physiological activities on
mammals. in addition to its sedative and teratogenic effects (1,
2), thalidomide possesses significant and unique immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities. it has been found
to be effective against several immune disorders, including
chronic graft-versus-host disease (3), oral and orpharygal
ulcers associated with hiv infection (4), erythema nodosum
leprosum in leprosy (5), and several other inflammatory skin
diseases (6). most recently, thalidomide was found to have
antiangiogenic activity (7), raising the possibility that it may be
used to treat certain types of angiogenesis-dependent diseases
such as diabetic retinopathy and cancer.
the immunomodulatory effect and the related antiinflammatory effect of thalidomide have attracted much attention in recent years. in searching for the cellular targets of
thalidomide, several models of immune regulation have been
examined. it was reported that the calcium-dependent lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen and alloantigens
is inhibited by thalidomide (8). d. neubert and coworkers (9)
uncovered several cell surface molecules whose expression is
either enhanced or inhibited by the drug in vivo. kaplan and
colleagues (10, 11) found that thalidomide selectively inhibits
the production of  xxxg2296xxx  a ( xxxg2296xxx ) from
stimulated human monocytes both in vitro and in vivo, providing a possible mechanism for both the immunomodulatory
and the antiinflammatory activities of the drug. this  xxxg2296xxx 
inhibitory effect has been ascribed to enhanced mrna degradation by the drug (12). blockade of  xxxg2296xxx  production
seems to underlie the inhibition of replication of the type 1

synthesis of thalidomide photoaffinity label [125i]aippot 9. all procedures were performed in the absence of direct
light. [125i]azidoiodophenylpropionic acid succinimidyl ester
(120 ,tci in 120 ,ul of ethyl acetate) was concentrated under a
stream of nitrogen to a volume of less than 5 ,ul. a suspension
of 1 mg of 3-(aminoethoxy)thalidomide in 100 ,ul of ethyl
acetate/0.5% triethylamine was added. the reaction mixture
was left overnight at room temperature in a closed container.
the product was purified by silica gel chromatography. fractions were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen to <5 ,ul,
and then the product was resuspended in 100 ,ul of methanol
and stored at -80°c.
monocyte isolation and  xxxg2296xxx  secretion assay. peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood
by centrifugation on  xxxd3253xxx -paque plus (pharmacia) step gradients. cells were washed three times in cell culture medium
(rpmi 1640 medium). a monocyte-enriched fraction was
isolated by suspending the cells to 2.5 x 106/ml in complete

mm l-glutamine) and allowing cells to adhere to plastic tissue
culture plates in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 at 37°c
for 3 hr. nonadherent cells were removed by washing with
serum-free medium, and adherent cells were detached by
scraping and washed twice with serum-free medium. to assay
for  xxxg2296xxx  production, cells were resuspended in complete
medium to 106 cells/0.9 ml and plated at 0.45 ml per well in
24-well plates. cells were allowed to adhere for 2 hr at 37°c
before drugs or analogs dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso) were added with a final concentration of 0.2%
dmso. this was followed by addition of lipopolysaccharide
(lps) (in 50 ,ul of complete medium) to a final concentration
of 1 ,tg/ml. plates were incubated for 16 hr in a humidified
incubator (37°c/5% c02). drug treatment did not significantly affect cell viability compared with dmso controls, as
judged by trypan blue exclusion. culture supernatants were
collected by centrifugation at 1300 x g for 6 min at 4°c.  xxxg2296xxx 
was assayed by elisa using mouse anti-human  xxxg2296xxx  monoclonal antibodies from pharmingen according to the supplier's
instructions. the levels of  xxxg2296xxx  were derived from a second
order polynomial standard curve (r2 > 0.995 for each determination).
preparation of tissue extracts. freshly prepared bovine
thymus tissue was shipped on ice and used the same day. after
connective tissue was removed, the organs were cut into small
pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen. frozen chunks were
weighed, powdered, and then suspended in cytosol buffer (20
mm tris-hcl, ph 6.9/100 mm nacl/2 mm 2- xxxd26xxx /0.02% nan3/5% glycerol/l mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride), 1 ml/g of tissue, in a blender. suspensions were
dounce homogenized with 10 up-and-down strokes and centrifuged at 9000 x g to remove most of the debris. the

supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 x g, and the s100
fraction was stored in aliquots at -80°c until needed.
photoaffinity labeling. ctude or partially purified tissue
extract containing 5-20 ,ug of total protein or 0.1 ,ug of purified
human agp (sigma) was diluted in labeling buffer (20 mm
tris hcl, ph 7.0/50 mm nacl/l mm mgc12/1 mm cacl2/0.5
mm edta) to a final volume of 45 al. drug or dmso (0.5%
volume) was added followed by incubation at 37°c for 30 min.
photoaffinity label (-1 aci/,ul) was diluted 5-fold in labeling
buffer in bulk immediately before use, and 5 ,ul was added to
each labeling tube in the absence of direct light. samples were
mixed and incubated at 37°c for 30 min in the dark and then
irradiated in a stratalinker (stratagene) at 254 nm with a total
energy output of 3.3 j/m2. for one-dimensional sds/page,
reactions were quenched by adding 3.5 ,li of 2- xxxd26xxx  followed by 18 al of 4x sds/page sample buffer (250
mm tris hcl, ph 6.8/40% glycerol/5% sds/0.1 mg/ml bromophenol blue). samples were heated in a boiling water bath
for 3 min before they were subjected to sds/page. for
two-dimensional electrophoresis, reactions were quenched by
adding s ,ul of 10% sds/150 mm dithiothreitol. samples were
heated as above and cooled, and s ,ul of  xxxd3471xxx  [65 mm

dithiothreitol/4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]1-propanesulfonate (chaps)/9 m urea/5% bio-rad biolyte 3-10 ampholyte] was added. samples were loaded onto
isoelectric focusing gels (4.5% acrylamide/0.4% bisacrylamide/9.2 m urea/1% bio-lyte 5-7 ampholyte/4%
biolyte 3-10 ampholyte/1.5% chaps/0.5% nonidet p-40, 14
cm x 2.5 mm) and run for 12 hr at 400 v followed by 2 hr at
1000 v in a bio-rad protean ii apparatus with 6 mm
phosphoric acid in the lower chamber and 20 mm sodium
hydroxide in the upper chamber. the sds/page dimension
was 12% acrylamide/0.32% bis-acrylamide. gels were stained
with coomassie blue, dried onto blotting paper, and exposed

protein purification. all procedures were carried out at 4°c.
ammonium sulfate (7.36 g, 61%) was added to 20 ml of bovine
thymus s100 fraction (9.2 mg/ml protein) with mixing. the
mixture was incubated on a rotator for 16 hr followed by
centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 15 min. ammonium sulfate
(4.20 g, 92%) was added to the supernatant and rotated for 8
hr. the mixture was centrifuged as before. the pellet was
resuspended in 2 ml of buffer containing 20 mm tris hcl (ph
6.8) and 100 mm nacl, and dialyzed into 20 mm sodium
acetate, ph 4.1/20 mm nacl overnight. the resulting suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min to remove the
precipitate, and the supernatant was applied to a carboxymethyl sepharose column. the column was washed with the
dialysis buffer. the flow-through fractions were pooled and
dialyzed into 50 mm ammonium carbonate for 24 hr with one
change of buffer. the sample was lyophilized overnight and
resuspended in 20 al of h20.
neuraminidase digestion and protein sequencing. the
purified thalidomide-binding proteins (10 ,li), 17 al 0.1 m
sodium acetate (ph 5.5), and 3 ,li of c. perfringens neuraminidase (sigma type v, 1 milliunits/,ll) were mixed and incubated at 37°c for 5 hr. to the mixture were added 2.5 ,l of
2- xxxd26xxx  and 10 ,ul of 4x sds sample buffer. the
sample was heated in a boiling water bath for 3 min and
subjected to sds/page as above. the proteins were then
blotted onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. the blot
was stained with ponceau s and destained briefly in doubly
distilled water before the band corresponding to the thalidomide-binding protein was sliced out. the membrane was
submitted for proteolytic digestion with either lys-c or chymotrypsin. peptide fragments were separated by hplc and
sequenced by edman degradation at the harvard microchemistry facility and the massachusetts institute of technology
biopolymer laboratory.

results
the relatively low potency of thalidomide as an inhibitor of
 xxxg2296xxx  production suggests that thalidomide may have a low
affinity for its target, making it difficult to employ conventional affinity chromatography to identify and purify the
potential target proteins. we therefore resorted to the more
sensitive method of photoaffinity labeling to identify thalidomide-binding proteins. to make an active thalidomide photoaffinity label, we needed to define a position in thalidomide
to which a radioactive photocrosslinking moiety could be
attached without significantly abrogating its activity. a survey
of the literature indicated that c-3 of the phthalimide group
may be such a position as it has been shown that 3-hydroxythalidomide is active in animal models for both graft-versus-host
disease (14) and embryopathy (15). we synthesized a nonra-

dioactive photoaffinity label of thalidomide, aippot, by
attaching a 4-azido-3-iodophenylpropionyl group onto 3-hydroxythalidomide via an ethanolamine linker (fig. 1). when
the activity of the nonradioactive photoaffinity label was
determined, it was found to be more active than thalidomide
itself (fig. 2). while thalidomide inhibits  xxxg2296xxx  production
with an ic50 of over 200 ,am, its solubility limit in aqueous
medium, the attachment of the side chain onto the 3-hydroxy
group in the photoaffinity label resulted in an increase in its
potency, with an ic50 of less than 100 ,um.
we subsequently synthesized the radioactive photoaffinity
label containing 125i (fig. 1) and used it to identify potential
thalidomide-binding proteins in membrane and soluble extracts prepared from fresh bovine thymus, an abundant source
of proteins from lymphoid cells. although no specific proteins
were detected in the membrane fraction (data not shown),

fig. 2. effect of thalidomide and aippot on the secretion of
 xxxg2296xxx  by lps-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes. monocytes were treated with 1 jig/ml lps for 16 hr in the presence of
varying concentrations of drug or carrier alone (0.2% dmso). the
amount of  xxxg2296xxx  was determined in culture supernatants by elisa.
results are expressed as the percentage of  xxxg2296xxx  produced compared
with dmso control and are the average of two experiments with
separate donors each performed in triplicate.

treatment of the soluble extract with [125i]aippot followed by
irradiation at 254 nm resulted in specific labeling of two
proteins with apparent molecular mass of ca. 45 and 43 kda
(fig. 3). this labeling can be competed with unmodified
thalidomide at concentrations comparable to those required
for  xxxg2296xxx  inhibition in the cellular assay (figs. 2 and 3).
to find an optimal procedure for isolating the putative
thalidomide-binding proteins, we determined, among other

physical properties, their isoelectric points. two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis of labeled thymus extract revealed the
putative thalidomide-binding proteins to be extremely acidic
with isoelectric points of ca. 3.5 (fig. 4). moreover, the two
labeled protein bands on one-dimensional sds/page were
resolved into a series of spots in the isoelectric focusing
dimension. the unusually high acidity of the putative thalidomide-binding proteins led us to search in the literature for
proteins with similar isoelectric points. indeed, we found that
agp, also called orosomucoid, was strikingly similar to the
putative thalidomide-binding proteins on a two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis map with few other proteins in its neighborhood (16). this finding helped to simplify the isolation and
identification of the thalidomide-binding proteins.
using the established purification procedures for agp as a
guide and the thalidomide photoaffinity labeling as an assay,
we purified the thalidomide-binding proteins to near homogeneity in two steps. starting with crude bovine thymus extract,
the thalidomide-binding activity was concentrated in 61-92%
ammonium sulfate precipitate (17). after dialysis into acidic
sodium acetate buffer, the fraction containing thalidomidebinding protein was subjected to weak cation exchange carboxymethyl sepharose chromatography (18). the thalidomide-binding proteins were present in the flow-through fraction at ph 4.1, which was virtually free of other proteins (fig.
5, lane 1). the n-termini of the proteins thus purified were
blocked, in agreement with the known n-terminal pyrogluta-

mate moiety of agp (19). since agp is also known to have a
high sialic acid content, we treated the purified thalidomidebinding proteins with neuraminidase. upon neuraminidase
treatment, the two thalidomide-binding protein bands were
converted into a single protein band, suggesting that the two
bands originated from the same protein with differential
sialylation. removal of the sialic acids also allowed for the
subsequent proteolysis of the proteins and sequencing of the
proteolytic fragments. the sequences of four proteolytic fragments were determined. all showed high homology with
human agp (fig. 6). although the bovine agp has not been
cloned, the four peptides sequences are 75% identical and 93%
similar to human agp (20). by comparison, rabbit agp only
bears 59% identity and 74% similarity to human agp in the
same regions, suggesting that the thalidomide-binding proteins
in bovine thymus extract are isoforms of the bovine agp.
to confirm that agp binds to thalidomide, we labeled
commercially available agp from several species. the labeling
of human agp with thalidomide photoaffinity label is shown
in fig. 7a. indeed, [125i]aippot labels human agp and this
labeling is competed by both thalidomide and the nonradioactive aippot, with the latter being more potent. the
potencies of thalidomide and aippot are in general agreement with the relative potency of these two compounds in the
 xxxg2296xxx  secretion assay (fig. 2).

basic and occasionally neutral drugs and exert important

effects on their pharmacokinetics (21). we compared the drug
binding site for thalidomide and several other drugs using a
competition assay in which the labeling of agp by the
thalidomide photoaffinity label was cafried out in the presence
of two known agp-binding drugs, propranolol and  xxxd123xxx .
as shown in fig. 7b, both propranolol and  xxxd123xxx  compete
effectively against the thalidomide photoaffinity label for
agp, with  xxxd123xxx  being more potent than propranolol. it
is likely that thalidomide binds to agp at the same or an
overlapping site as propranolol and  xxxd123xxx .

discussion
thalidomide is known to possess immunomodulatory and
antiinflammatory effects. however, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of these activities are not understood. among the
various cellular effects of thalidomide, the inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx 
seems to offer a plausible mechanism for several known
immunomodulatory activities of the drug. using lps-induced
 xxxg2296xxx  secretion in human monocytes as an assay and an active
thalidomide photoaffinity label as a probe, we isolated and
identified two thalidomide-binding proteins as isoforms of
agp.
agp belongs to the class of acute phase proteins that are
known to be induced in the liver in response to a wide variety
of physiological stresses, including inflammation, infection,
pregnancy, and malignancy (22, 23). it is distinct from other
serum proteins by its high carbohydrate content (over 40% by
weight) and high acidity. although it has been known for more
than a century (24), the precise biological function of agp still
remains unknown. nevertheless, a number of studies have

pointed to potential roles of agp in the regulation of the
immune system and in inflammation. agp was shown to have
immunosuppressive activity in the mixed lymphocyte reaction
(25), and an agp-like immunosuppressive acidic protein was
found from ascitic fluids of cancer patients (26). the potential
role of agp in inflammation has been somewhat controversial. on the one hand, agp was shown to exert a protective
effect against  xxxg2296xxx  and lps-induced lethality when it is
administered intraperitoneally in mice (27). it has also been
shown to inhibit platelet aggregation (28) and thus may be
capable of preventing secretion of other proinflammatory
factors. on the other hand, agp was shown to potentiate
lps-induced secretion of such inflammatory cytokines as
 xxxg2296xxx  and interleukin 1 in human monocytes in vitro (29).
since thalidomide inhibits lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  secretion, it
will be interesting to see whether thalidomide acts by inhibiting
agp's potentiating activity for lps. it also remains to be
determined whether thalidomide has any effect on other
immunomodulatory activities of agp.
as an abundant plasma protein, agp binds to many drugs
and can modulate their metabolism (21). those drugs include
known 83-blockers such as propranolol and  xxxd123xxx . competition experiments indicate that thalidomide binds to the
same site in agp as propranolol and  xxxd123xxx . none of the
drugs, however, possess the same unique immunomodulatory
and antiinflammatory activities of thalidomide. whether binding of thalidomide to agp confers a unique conformational
change to the protein leading to a gain of function remains to
be investigated.
the primary source of agp is known to be hepatocytes (30).
however, it has been shown that lymphocytes, granulocytes
and monocytes also express a membrane-associated form of
agp (31). it has also been reported that monocytes can serve
as a source of soluble agp (32). in fact, we have found that
upon lps stimulation, the promonocytic cell line thp-1
differentiated by treatment with la, 25-dihydroxy  xxxd1682xxx 
produces large amount of agp along with  xxxg2296xxx  (unpublished results). these observations are consistent with the
aforementioned immunomodulatory activities of agp and
suggest that agp may play an important role in immunoregulation. the fact that thalidomide binds to agp with high
specificity implies that agp may mediate the immunomodulatory effect of the drug.
