introduction. increased risk for gastrointestinal
ulceration is associated with blockade of  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) derived prostaglandins.1 until very
recently, all commercially available nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) were inhibitors of both
cox-1 and cox-2. selective inhibitors of cox-2 are
now widely recognized as offering the promise of treatment of inflammatory conditions without the side effects
associated with consumption of nonselective inhibitors.2,3 celecoxib (1)4 and rofecoxib (2)5 recently were
the first two highly selective cox-2 inhibitors to be
approved in selected markets for the treatment of
certain inflammatory conditions.

to date, relatively few nsaids may be administered
parenterally for the treatment of pain and inflammation. one of the most effective nonnarcotic analgesics
for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain,
particularly postsurgical pain, is ketorolac (3).6-8 although very effective as an analgesic, ketorolac use is
associated with a significant incidence of untoward side
effects. the most common side effects associated with
ketorolac consumption are increased risk for upper
gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, particularly in

the elderly; reduction of renal function, potentially
leading to fluid retention and exacerbation of hypertension; and inhibition of platelet function, potentially
predisposing to increased operative bleeding.9-11
ketorolac is a potent inhibitor of both cox-1 and cox2.12
in general, cox-2 inhibitors of the diarylheterocycle
class such as 1 and 2 possess modest aqueous solubility.
this physicochemical characteristic restricts the dosing
options available for this class of drug. in considering
the development of a cox-2 inhibitor for parenteral
administration, we wondered if a prodrug of a sulfonamide-based inhibitor could be designed which would
possess the appropriate combination of aqueous solubility and in vivo antiinflammatory activity. herein we
describe our efforts that culminated in the identification
of the injectable cox-2 inhibitor  xxxd2849xxx  sodium (5b).
chemistry. acylation of isoxazole  xxxd1872xxx  with
an anhydride in the presence of triethylamine afforded
the corresponding acylated sulfonamide. the sodium
salt was then prepared by titration of the acylated
sulfonamide with aqueous sodium hydroxide to afford
the requisite sodium salts 5, scheme 1.
results and discussion. an important criterion
that we established for a parenteral cox-2 inhibitor
was for it to possess sufficient analgesic potency such
that patients could be dosed with a minimal injection
volume. large injection volumes can be time consuming
and may contribute to discomfort for patients. meeting
the criterion of a small injection volume dictated that
only very potent compounds would be ideal for this
application. among the most potent and selective cox-2
inhibitors that have been identified is the isoxazole
sulfonamide  xxxd3481xxx  (4). against recombinant human
cyclooxygenase isoforms, 4 showed the following activity: hcox-1 ic50 ) 140 µm and  xxxg1884xxx  ic50 ) 0.005
µm. in addition, 4 possesses exceptional antiinflammatory activity in vivo.13 our strategy to develop an
injectable cox-2 inhibitor commenced with the idea of
identifying a water-soluble prodrug of 4 that would
undergo biotransformation in vivo. to test whether an
acylated sulfonamide14,15 would serve as a prodrug for
4, 5a was prepared as described above and evaluated
in vitro and in vivo. to our considerable satisfaction,
the solubility of 5a in phosphate-buffered saline at 25
°c was found to be quite substantial, 44 mg/ml. against
the recombinant isoforms of human cyclooxygenases, 5a
was found to show very weak inhibitory activity, hcox-1
ic50 f 100 µm and  xxxg1884xxx  ic50 f 20 µm. however, in
the carrageenan air pouch model of inflammation,16 5a
showed potent antiinflammatory activity after intravenous, intramuscular, or oral administration, ed50 )
0.5 mg/kg.
the ample antiinflammatory activity of 5a suggested
that the acyl moiety was cleaved in vivo. to confirm this
hypothesis, the pharmacokinetics and metabolic profile
of 5a were examined. it was found that the half-life for

the conversion of 5a to 4 was about 15 min in rats.
however, when 5a was administered either intravenously or orally to canines or cynomolgus monkeys, it
was found that 5a was not completely converted to 4
and a significant amount of compound was eliminated
in the urine unchanged. the attractive antiinflammatory activity of 5a in rodents warranted evaluation of
the congeners 5b and 5c in the rodent, dog, and monkey.
fortunately, in these three species both 5b and 5c were
rapidly and completely converted to 4. in addition, in
vitro metabolic studies with human liver microsomes
showed that both 5b and 5c were completely converted
to 4. owing to the more favorable solubility of 5b (22
mg/ml at 25 °c) versus 5c (10 mg/ml at 25 °c) in
phosphate-buffered saline, a more through assessment
of the biological activity 5b was conducted.
pharmacokinetic studies of 5b were conducted in vivo
in the rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey to determine
the rate and extent of its conversion to 4. the in vivo
conversion of 5b was complete and rapid after intravenous administration to male rats (mean elimination
half-life ) 0.135 ( 0.003 h), female dogs (0.553 ( 0.009
h), and female cynomolgus monkeys (1.21 ( 0.004 h).
shown in figure 1 is the pharmacokinetic profile of 5b
in rodents. in vivo administration of 5b demonstrated
its bioequivalence to orally administered 4. chronic
antiinflammatory activity was achieved in the rat
adjuvant arthritis model, ed50 ) 0.08 mg/kg.17 acute
antiinflammatory activity of 5b was demonstrated in
the carrageenan air pouch assay, 98% inhibition at 0.3
mg/kg.
intravenous administration of 5b showed considerable activity in an acute analgesic assay (carrageenan
foot pad edema).18,19 the analgesic efficacy as well as
the onset of action of 5b was assessed in a therapeutic
paradigm.8 three hours after administration of carrageenan to the hind foot pad of rats results in maximal
edema and pain response. when edema and pain

reached a maximal response, 5b was administered
intravenously and the reversal of hyperalgesia measured. shown in figures 2 and 3 are the results of
administration of 30 mg/kg ketorolac compared with the
same dose of 5b. when dosed therapeutically, ketorolac
(30 mg/kg) rapidly and completely inhibited the pain
response. the activity of 5b at 30 mg/kg in this model
compared favorably with the activity of ketorolac,
producing a complete blockade of the carrageenaninduced hyperalgesia within 1 h after intravenous
administration (figure 3). the ed50 for 5b in this model

achieved within 1 h of administration, indicating that
it possesses a potent and fast-acting analgesic pharmacological profile.
conclusions. the availability of a safe and efficacious injectable cox-2 inhibitor for acute pain management, particularly postsurgical pain, constitutes an
important unmet medical need.  xxxd2849xxx  sodium, 5b,
a water-soluble prodrug of  xxxd3481xxx , 4, was identified
as a highly potent and selective inhibitor of pgs from
cox-2. in a therapeutic model of acute pain,  xxxd2849xxx 
sodium showed excellent efficacy and a rapid onset of
action comparable with the most potent analgesic
nsaid ketorolac.  xxxd2849xxx  sodium is currently in
clinical evaluation for the management of acute pain.
