 xxxd2704xxx  is a third generation beta-blocker. it is highly selective for the
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor, and has additional  xxxd2738xxx -mediated vasodilating and
antioxidant properties, along with a favourable metabolic profile.  xxxd2704xxx 
is well tolerated by patients with hypertension and heart failure. although
several smaller studies were conducted with  xxxd2704xxx  in hypertensive
patients, no large randomised clinical trials have been performed to prove
efficacy on hard clinical end points. in patients with heart failure, a large
mortality/morbidity trial was conducted, and  xxxd2704xxx  was shown to reduce
the composite end point of mortality and hospitalisations.  xxxd2704xxx  is
registered, in europe, for mild-to-moderate, uncomplicated hypertension
and mild-to-moderate heart failure; and outside europe, for hypertension.
this review describes experimental and clinical data regarding this selective
beta-blocker with vasodilating and antioxidant effects.

introduction

beta-blockers are the cornerstone of treatment of cardiovascular diseases, from
hypertension to heart failure, and from angina pectoris to cardiac arrhythmias.
 xxxd2704xxx  is a so-called third generation beta-adrenoceptor blocker. first generation
beta-blockers, classically propranolol, were nonspecific (i.e., they block both  xxxg836xxx - and
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors). as the heart primarily expresses  xxxg836xxx -receptors, there was a need
for more specific blockade. the second generation beta-adrenoceptor blockers were
developed with higher affinity for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor; examples are atenolol,
metoprolol and bisoprolol. however, in higher doses, they tend to lose their specificity. third generation beta-blockers are different from the second generation ones in
that they have vasodilating properties. examples are  xxxd2435xxx , carvedilol, bucindolol
and  xxxd2704xxx .  xxxd2435xxx  is non-selective, with a high affinity for the alpha-receptors.
carvedilol is a  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic selective blocker, and although it is less specific than
 xxxd2704xxx , it is also an alpha-blocker. bucindolol is a non-specific beta-blocker that also
blocks the alpha-receptors.  xxxd2704xxx  has a higher affinity for  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, even
higher than second generation beta-blockers, with ancillary endothelium-dependent
vasodilatory effects via the l-arginine/ xxxd2738xxx  (no) pathway [1-7].  xxxd2704xxx  is
registered for hypertension, and recently, also for heart failure. this review provides
an update on the evidence and indications of  xxxd2704xxx  in hypertension and heart
failure, and discusses its role in the management of these diseases.
special attention is directed to recent reports that have called into question the
prominent place of beta-blockers in the management of hypertension [8]. as  xxxd2704xxx 
has a profile that is distinctively different from other beta-blockers, it remains unclear if
the possible inefficacy of beta-blockers also pertains to  xxxd2704xxx . in the setting of heart
failure,  xxxd2704xxx  has specifically been tested in elderly patients with heart failure due
to left ventricular systolic dysfunction or relatively preserved systolic dysfunction.

chemistry
 xxxd2704xxx  is a racemate (dl- xxxd2704xxx ) made up of equal parts
of the d- and the l-isomer of the drug [9,10]. figure 1 depicts
the chemical structure of  xxxd2704xxx . it is a highly  xxxg836xxx -adrenergic selective beta-blocker with distinct vasodilatory capacities.
the d-isomer primarily exerts beta-blocking effects; and both
the d-isomer and the l-isomer seem to have vasodilatory
capacities [9,11-12]. although  xxxd2704xxx , like all beta-blockers, will
block  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors to some extent, it is highly selective in
therapeutic doses. in human myocardium, affinity for the
 xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor is ∼ 300-fold higher than for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors [13]. in fact,  xxxd2704xxx  is the most selective beta-blocker of all
clinically applied beta-blockers [13]. it has very low affinity for
alpha(1,2)-adrenoceptors. the high degree of selectivity translates
into favourable effects on metabolism and safety profile. specifically, no adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism
have been observed [14]. the vasodilatory actions of  xxxd2704xxx 
occur via interaction with the endothelial l-arginine/no
pathway [2,15-16].

pharmacodynamics
 xxxd2704xxx  reduces blood pressure and heart rate. its antihypertensive effects will be discussed later.  xxxd2704xxx  has a
higher affinity for  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptors, even higher than second
generation beta-blockers. moreover, its ancillary endothelium-dependent vasodilative effects via the l-arginine/no
pathway [2,15-16] are of importance.  xxxd2704xxx  causes a
decrease in vascular peripheral resistance, in contrast to other
beta-blocking agents [12,17-20]. furthermore, again in contrast to
classical beta-blocking agents,  xxxd2704xxx  acutely improves left
ventricular performance.
in man,  xxxd2704xxx  causes vasodilation in veins [21] and arteries [22]. this can be abolished by the no competitor
ng-l monomethyl arginine, suggesting an l-arginine/no
pathway [21-22]. tzemos et al. performed a randomised, double-blind crossover study in 12 hypertensive patients, comparing the effects of atenolol versus  xxxd2704xxx  on endothelial
function [23]. they used forearm venous occlusion plethysmography and intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine. blood
pressure lowering effects with atenolol and  xxxd2704xxx  were
identical. however, the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine
was significantly increased with  xxxd2704xxx , and it was
unaffected by atenolol. the mechanism by which  xxxd2704xxx 
releases no has been explained in the last years. vasodilation
is achieved by atp efflux with consequent stimulation of
p2y-purinoceptor-mediated no release [24-25]. furthermore,
it has become clear that no is released, not via the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor, but rather via the  xxxg92xxx  [26] and the
 xxxg838xxx -adrenoceptor [27-28].
does the vasodilatory effect of  xxxd2704xxx  translate into altered
haemodynamics? there are some clues that suggest this. in
hypertensive patients without epicardial coronary artery disease
who were treated with  xxxd2704xxx , dypiridamole-induced stress
2.2

echocardiography induced a higher coronary flow reserve
(crf) compared with controls [29]. this can be reproduced
using invasive measurements [30]. in patients with heart failure
due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, treatment with
 xxxd2704xxx  also improves crf compared with controls, measured by dypiridamole-induced stress echocardiography [31].
therefore,  xxxd2704xxx  releases no via non- xxxg836xxx -receptor-pathways which lead to vasodilatation and sustained improvement
of crf.
 xxxd2704xxx  is not associated with an acute (and potentially
dangerous) decrease in cardiac output sometimes observed
after initiation of treatment with a beta-blocker. in experimental
studies, atenolol and propranolol but not  xxxd2704xxx , exhibit
such cardiodepressive effects upon initiation of the
therapy [32-33].
pharmacokinetics and metabolism
 xxxd2704xxx  is rapidly absorbed following oral administration,
reaching peak plasma concentrations in 0.5 – 4.0 h. absorption is not affected by food and age [19].  xxxd2704xxx  is subject
to extensive first-pass effect by hepatic metabolism primarily
through cyp450 2d6 enzymes. because there is substantial
variability in cyp2d6 activity throughout the (caucasian
but especially african) population [34], there are considerable
differences between individual patients in bioavailability,
distribution volume, half-life and, thus, clearance (see
table 1). a recent report shows that polymorphisms in the
gene encoding cyp2d6 significantly influence the metabolism of  xxxd2704xxx , but do not affect its antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability [35]. half-life varies between 13 h for
extensive metabolisers and 56 h for poor metabolisers; clearance is reduced to 2% and half-life is quadrupled in poor
metabolisers compared with extensive metabolisers [36].
nevertheless, bioavailability is relatively stable [37]. hepatic
impairment may slow the elimination of  xxxd2704xxx . patients
with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied in trials, so that this condition should evoke caution [38]. likewise, no data are available in patients with renal failure or on
haemodialysis, so  xxxd2704xxx  should be used with caution in
these patients as well [39]. despite its high lipophilicity, distribution of  xxxd2704xxx  in obese subjects is limited, pharmacodynamic parameters are unchanged, and no statistically
significant differences between obese and non-obese subjects
were reported [40].

clinical efficacy
phase i: hypertension

several safety studies were conducted in healthy volunteers.
 xxxd2704xxx  decreases blood pressure and heart rate to a similar
degree as atenolol, propranolol and  xxxd2957xxx , but the decrease
in peak exercise heart rate is less marked with  xxxd2704xxx  [41].
antihypertensive effects of  xxxd2704xxx  were shown to reside in
the d-isomer, and a dose-related response was evident with
racemic  xxxd2704xxx  in inhibiting exercise-induced tachycardia
over a range of doses studied [42].

phase i: heart failure

to test cardiac effects of 5 mg of  xxxd2704xxx  once/day, this
agent was given to 10 healthy volunteers for 14 days. by using
equilibrium radionuclide angiography, the ratio of the
pre-ejection period to the left ventricular ejection time, an
indirect measure of left ventricular performance, progressively
and significantly improved with  xxxd2704xxx  and induced a 10%
decrease in exercise-induced values of systolic blood pressure
(sbp) and heart rate (hr). stroke volume increased [43]. ventricular compliance is improved in healthy volunteers [41].
other data also indicate that  xxxd2704xxx  substantially improves
cardiac function in comparison with classical beta-blocking
agents (bisoprolol) or beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties
( xxxd458xxx , carvedilol) in healthy volunteers [44].
2.4.3

phase ii: hypertension

2.4.3.1

placebo-controlled trials

many small- and moderate-scale studies have been conducted
to show the efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  in hypertension. first,
efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  was established by comparing it with

placebo. these studies have been thoroughly discussed in
several review papers [1,2,6]. one of the earliest was a study by
de cree et al. in hypertensive patients, showing that  xxxd2704xxx 
decreases heart rate and (diastolic and systolic) blood pressure,
ánd improves diastolic function [20]. chan et al. observed that
 xxxd2704xxx , besides its antihypertensive effect, also effectively
decreases plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic peptide
[45]. besides these two very small studies, only one large double-blind placebo-controlled dose response trial has been performed. a total of 509 patients with a diastolic blood pressure
(dbp) > 95 mmhg, were randomised to either placebo
(n = 84) or to  xxxd2704xxx  (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg) [46].
primary outcome was the achieved supine dbp at through
level.  xxxd2704xxx  dose-dependently decreased blood pressure,
although 10 mg had no evident antihypertensive advantage
over 5 mg. at a dose of 5 mg, the through-to-peak ratio was
89%, which means that  xxxd2704xxx  is very suitable for
once-daily dosing. of note, the drug was very well tolerated,
as only 2.9% of the patients in the study withdrew, all of
whom did so for reasons that were unrelated to the drug.
2.4.3.2

comparative trials

active comparative trials have compared  xxxd2704xxx  with other
beta-blockers and ace-inhibitors (ace-i), calcium channel
antagonists (cca), and an angiotensin receptor blocker
(arb). most trials included patients with mild-to-moderate
hypertension (i.e., dbp of 95 – 114 mmhg). primary end
points were change in blood pressure, sometimes dbp, and
response rates to therapy. no comparative trials with ‘hard’
end points were performed. in all studies, a target dose of
 xxxd2704xxx  5 mg q.d. was used.
an excellent recent review summarises the antihypertensive
efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  by discussing all randomised trials that

expert opin. pharmacother. (2007) 8(10)

1541

 xxxd2704xxx 

have included > 60 patients [6]. this paper summarises the
data from that paper in the following section.
active comparative trials: other beta-blockers
the van nueten group conducted another trial placebo-controlled trial with  xxxd2704xxx  in patients with hypertension but
added an additional group with atenolol (target dose:
50 mg q.d.) [47].  xxxd2704xxx  seemed to exhibit comparable
effects as atenolol. this finding was corroborated in a study
by grassi et al. [48]. in this trial, 205 mild-to-moderate middle-age essential hypertensives were randomised to either
 xxxd2704xxx  5 mg/day (n = 105) or atenolol 100 mg/day
(n = 100) over a period of 12 weeks. again, the two drugs
induced similar, significant antihypertensive effects. uhlir
et al. compared the efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  with metoprolol
and found no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes,
although response rate seemed higher with  xxxd2704xxx  [49].
czuriga et al. compared the effects of  xxxd2704xxx  and bisoprolol (target dose: 5 mg q.d.) and found equipotent effects in
antihypertensive potential [50].
response rate (i.e., normalisation of blood pressure; usually
defined as < 140/90 mmhg) after initiation of the intervention was comparable between  xxxd2704xxx  and other beta-blocking
agents, except for metoprolol, which evoked a lesser response
rate than  xxxd2704xxx .
therefore, in direct comparisons with other beta-blockers,
 xxxd2704xxx  seems to exert equal or slightly better antihypertensive effects as compared with atenolol, metoprolol
and bisoprolol.

2.4.3.4

active comparative trials: other antihypertensives

in a trial with 419 patients, comparing enalapril 10 mg q.d.
with  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg q.d.,  xxxd2704xxx  decreased dbp to a larger
extent after 12 weeks of treatment [51]. however, after
7 months follow-up in a subset of patients kept on enalapril
and  xxxd2704xxx  study medication, this difference had abated [52].
another study used lisinopril 20 mg q.d. as a comparator,
given for 12 weeks to patients with mild-to-moderate essential
hypertension [53]. a total of 68 patients were randomised.
again, after 12 weeks,  xxxd2704xxx  was more efficacious in reducing sbp and dbp. an older study, using 24-h ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring to assess the effects of  xxxd2704xxx 
(2.5 – 10.0 mg q.d.) and lisinopril (10 – 40 mg q.d.), also
reported no differences between these two regimes [54].
at least three trials were conducted to compare the efficacy
of  xxxd2704xxx  with ccas. in the first study, 51 patients with
mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were randomised to
double-blind treatment with either  xxxd2704xxx  (5 mg q.d.;
n = 26) or nifedipine sustained-release 20 mg (b.i.d.; n = 25)
over a period of 12 weeks [55]. both treatments produced similar and significant (p = 0.0001) reduction in office blood
pressure, as well as in 24-h, work, awake and sleep ambulatory
blood pressure. a second, larger study included 420 hypertensive patients (dbp > 95 mmhg) and randomised them to
either  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg q.d. or nifedipine 20 mg q.d. [56]. after
1542

12 weeks of treatment, blood pressure reductions were similar
in both groups. in a last study,  xxxd2704xxx  (2.5 – 5.0 mg q.d.)
was compared to amlodipine (5 – 10 q.d.) in 168 elderly
(aged 65 – 89 years) hypertensive patients (dbp between 95
and 115 mmhg) [57]. no significant differences were seen in
dbp (primary response parameter). in both trials, side effects
and study withdrawal were more prevalent in patients
receiving cca than in patients receiving  xxxd2704xxx  (p < 0.001
and < 0.05, respectively).
van bortel et al. compared  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg q.d. with
losartan 50 mg q.d. [58]. sbp was decreased similarly but
 xxxd2704xxx  decreased dbp more potently, both after 6 and
12 weeks (p < 0.001). quality of life was equal in both
treatment regimes.
response rates were comparable at the end of the studies,
except for nifedipine, which caused a lower response rate than
 xxxd2704xxx . figure 2 graphically depicts the changes in blood
pressure achieved by  xxxd2704xxx  and various comparators.
phase ii: heart failure
other than in hypertension, most trials with  xxxd2704xxx  in
heart failure have been conducted with placebo as a control.
beneficial effects of  xxxd2704xxx  in patients with chronic heart
failure were already described in 1990. in 10 male patients
with ischaemic heart failure, 7 days of treatment with  xxxd2704xxx  5 mg/day increased stroke volume, whereas cardiac output
remained unchanged [59]. a small, randomised, double-blind
trial with a follow-up of 3 months in 24 patients with heart
failure patients showed that  xxxd2704xxx  (1 – 5 mg/day) significantly increased lvef (0.23 to 0.33 versus 0.21 to 0.23 with
placebo) and significantly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure (21 to 15 versus 24 to 20 mmhg with placebo) but
without changes in parameters of diastolic function [60]. in
another small, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
study,  xxxd2704xxx  tended to improve clinical status and
functional capacity more than placebo [61]. statistically
significant improvements of functional status, left ventricular
function and left ventricular dilatation were demonstrated in a
small study (n = 12) comparing  xxxd2704xxx  (2.5 – 5.0 mg/day)
and placebo [62].
these studies prompted the heart failure community to
conduct comparative trials.  xxxd2704xxx  (2.5 – 5 mg/day) was
compared to atenolol 50 mg/day in 40 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction [63]. although improvement
in lvef was similar, only  xxxd2704xxx  improved diastolic function. kamp et al. explored the effects of  xxxd2704xxx , compared
with atenolol, on systolic and diastolic function in hypertensive patients with a preserved systolic function [64]. the blood
pressure lowering effect of  xxxd2704xxx  was related to a reduction
in peripheral resistance and an increase in stroke volume with
preservation of cardiac output. the blood pressure lowering
effect of atenolol was strongly related to cardiac output and
heart rate reduction. in addition, the beneficial effects of
 xxxd2704xxx  on mortality and morbidity were equally strong in
the patients with and without a ‘preserved’ systolic function.

the effects of  xxxd2704xxx  on left ventricular diastolic dysfunction were separately studied and compared to atenolol [65]. a
total of 26 patients with hypertension and echocardiographic
evidence of diastolic dysfunction received either  xxxd2704xxx  up to
5 mg/day or atenolol up to 100 mg/day. the primary outcome
parameter was the change of pulmonary wedge pressure, which
dropped from 15 to 12 mmhg in the  xxxd2704xxx  patients and
from 14 to 13 mmhg in atenolol patients (p = 0.03 between
groups). in addition, non-invasive doppler derived left ventricular diastolic function (e/a ratio) improved from 0.79 to
0.91 in the  xxxd2704xxx  patients and from 0.84 to 0.89 in the
atenolol patients (p = 0.004 between groups).
patrianakos et al. performed a study comparing
(state-of-the-art) treatment with carvedilol with  xxxd2704xxx  in
double-blind, randomised trial with 72 patients with
non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, lvef < 45%, new york
heart association (nyha) classes ii – iii [66]. follow-up was
12 months. nyha class and lvef were markedly improved
both by  xxxd2704xxx  and carvedilol. comparing the two groups,
it became clear that carvedilol caused a larger increase in
lvef at 3 months (p = 0.04) and 12 months (p = 0.02) follow-up compared with  xxxd2704xxx . advanced diastolic dysfunction regressed to earlier stages in carvedilol patients after
3 and 12 months (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively),
whereas  xxxd2704xxx  caused a significant improvement in diastolic dysfunction at the 12 months’ follow-up (p = 0.02). exercise duration improved in both groups after 12 months, but
in the  xxxd2704xxx  group, there was an initial deterioration at

3 months (p = 0.07). from this trial, it can be concluded that
both  xxxd2704xxx  and carvedilol have beneficial effects on lv
systolic and diastolic function, as well as exercise capacity in
patients with non/ischaemic cardiomyopathy. however,
carvedilol exhibits more favourable effects on lv function
than does  xxxd2704xxx . a smaller study confirms that  xxxd2704xxx 
may resemble the effects of carvedilol in heart failure [67].
these promising results with  xxxd2704xxx  resulted in two larger
clinical trials in patients with chronic heart failure. the
eneca (efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  in the treatment of elderly
patients with chronic heart failure as add-on therapy) trial
included 260 patients > 65 years with nyha class ii – iv
chronic heart failure and an lvef < 35% [68]. patients were
randomised to either  xxxd2704xxx  (up to 10 mg o.d.) or placebo.
left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 25.4 to 32.0%
in the  xxxd2704xxx  group and from 26.4 to 30.4% in the placebo
group (p = 0.027). the second, larger trial is discussed later.
phase iii: hypertension
no studies with  xxxd2704xxx  have been conducted nor are
underway with the potential to definitively pin down the efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  in hypertension in comparison with present
‘gold standard’ treatment.
2.4.5

phase iii: heart failure
the promising results described have resulted in a large
phase iii trial exploring the effects of  xxxd2704xxx  in patients
with heart failure: the seniors (study of the effects of

 xxxd2704xxx  intervention on outcomes and rehospitalisation in
seniors with heart failure) trial [69]. this trial bears two
unique features: first, it studied the efficacy of beta-blockade in
heart failure in elderly patients (> 70 years of age), and second,
the seniors trial included patients with relatively preserved
left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction > 35%), as
long as they had a recent (< 12 months), documented hospital
admission with discharge diagnosis of heart failure. the main
exclusion criteria were bradycardia (< 60 b.p.m.), hypotension
(sbp < 90 mmhg), and more common exclusion criteria, such
as uncontrolled hypertension, uncorrected valvular disease,
kidney and/or hepatic failure, cerebrovascular events within
3 months of randomisation, anticipated surgery or percutaneous interventions, or conditions that may have reduced survival during the study period. in total, 2135 patients were
enrolled and 2128 were available for analysis, of which 1067
were randomised to  xxxd2704xxx  and 1061 were randomised to
placebo. mean age was 76.1 years (standard deviation 4.7).
the main outcome parameter was a composite end point of all
cause mortality and cardiovascular hospital admission. a
number of secondary outcomes were prespecified. it turned
out that after a follow-up of 21 months, the primary end point
was reduced by  xxxd2704xxx  by 4.2% (332 out of 1067 events in
patients receiving  xxxd2704xxx  and 375 out of 1061 events in
patients receiving placebo); hr = 0.86 (ci = 0.74 – 0.99);
p = 0.039; figure 3. other end points were not statistically significantly decreased (table 2). this has been ascribed to a lack
of power (too few patients), a lesser efficacy of beta-blockers in
patients with preserved ventricular function and a threshold of
biological age beyond which the benefit of treatment is difficult to show. nevertheless, all secondary end points are beneficially affected, and the beneficial effects of  xxxd2704xxx  were
observed in most subgroups, although the effect of  xxxd2704xxx 
may diminish in patients with increasing age (event rate for
patients receiving  xxxd2704xxx  16.6% for those < 75 years of age
(placebo 21.4%), and 24.6% for those > 75 years of age
(placebo 26.7%). side effects were not more common in
patients taking  xxxd2704xxx  except bradycardia (11.1 versus 2.6%
for patients receiving placebo). remarkably, new onset atrial
fibrillation is not prevented by  xxxd2704xxx . in an echocardiographic substudy, the lvef was increased with 4.6% in
patients receiving  xxxd2704xxx , but this effect was observed only
in patients with a lvef < 35% at baseline [70].
2.5 other effects of  xxxd2704xxx  and indications for
 xxxd2704xxx 

 xxxd2704xxx , like carvedilol, has established antioxidant
capacities. this has been shown in various experimental
settings [71-74].  xxxd2704xxx  reduces oxidative stress in healthy [75]
and hypertensive [76] human subjects. it decreases oxidative
stress through its antioxidant properties. this is brought about
by the prevention of no inactivation through reduction of
reactive oxygen species and superoxide anions (o2-) [76]. celik
et al. showed that this reduction in oxidative stress in hypertensive patients is accompanied with a decrease in insulin
1544

resistance index, a decrease in plasma soluble  xxxg2049xxx  levels
and increased adiponectin levels [77]. a very interesting report
from mason et al. suggests that the antioxidant effects are particularly useful in patients with slow no release and high o2release [78]. it was shown that a reduced no bioavailability in
american black patients is present, which is mainly due to
excessive superoxide anions (o2- and onoo-).  xxxd2704xxx 
decreased these concentrations and restored no bioavailability
independent from beta blockade. taken together, the antioxidant
effect of  xxxd2704xxx  is an important ancillary property that sets
 xxxd2704xxx  apart from first- and second-generation beta-blockers.
from a theoretical point of view,  xxxd2704xxx  should exert
anti-ischaemic effects. there are just a few trials that have
compared the anti-ischaemic properties of  xxxd2704xxx . in general, it seems that these properties may be equipotent to other
beta-blockers. however, the data are old, and generally, the studies consisted of very few patients, so that no meaningful comments can be made on the effects of  xxxd2704xxx  on ischaemic
heart disease and its outcomes.
 xxxd2704xxx  has been associated with an improvement in
serum lipids [55,79]. these data are largely observational, and
should be explored further. one randomised trial suggested
that  xxxd2704xxx  may be effective in improving baroreflex sensitivity [80].  xxxd2704xxx  has been associated with a decrease of
thrombotic state and platelet activation [81,82].
safety and tolerability
the high degree of selectivity for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor of
 xxxd2704xxx  translates into favourable effects on metabolism
and safety. the following side effects have been reported:
bradycardia, dizziness, headache, asthenia, tachycardia,
palpitations, rash, dry mouth, insomnia, nausea, fatigue,
chest pain, paraesthesia, oedema and anxiety. in patients with
hypertension,  xxxd2704xxx  increases quality of life [58,83],
whereas in patients with heart failure, a rather neutral effect
was reported [68]. in comparative trials with cca, patients
on  xxxd2704xxx  were withdrawn less often [56,57]. an older
review reported that in comparative trials, no statistically
significant differences were reported in severity and
frequency of adverse events in patients receiving  xxxd2704xxx ,
atenolol, enalapril or placebo [1]. however, in a meta-analysis
of ten comparative trials with atenolol, metoprolol and
bisoprolol, significantly less adverse events were reported for
 xxxd2704xxx  (hr = 0.66; ci = 0.52 – 0.85) [84]. specifically, no
adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism have been
observed [85-87]. beta-blockers have often been regarded as
second-choice drugs in patients with diabetes due to their
potential metabolic side effects. as many patients with
hypertension have concomitant obesity and/or metabolic
syndrome, this is an important consideration.  xxxd2704xxx ,
however, seems to have relatively beneficial effects on the
metabolic profile [14]. celik showed that  xxxd2704xxx  improves
insulin sensitivity and increases adiponectin levels to a larger
extent than metoprolol [77]. atenolol decreases insulin
sensitivity, but  xxxd2704xxx  does not [79]. ace-inhibitors are the

drug of choice in patients with hypertension and diabetes, for
their renoprotective and cardioprotective effects. kaiser
showed comparable effects on metabolic parameters of
 xxxd2704xxx  and an ace-inhibitor (enalapril) [88].
therefore, it seems that  xxxd2704xxx  is safe in patients with
diabetes. there is some evidence that favours its use in
patients with obesity and/or metabolic syndrome over other
beta-blockers, although end point studies are lacking.

furthermore,  xxxd2704xxx  does not cause airway
dysfunction in patients with obstructive lung disease [89].
pro-arrhythmia has not been reported with  xxxd2704xxx , and
qt interval seems to be unaffected [90,91]. erectile
dysfunction was not reported with  xxxd2704xxx , in a
comparative trial with metoprolol [92], possibly due to the
no-releasing capacities of  xxxd2704xxx .
only few reports are available on drug interactions with
 xxxd2704xxx . there is a potential risk for drug interactions, given
that  xxxd2704xxx  is extensively metabolised by the liver and is a
substrate for cyp3a4. one report showed that cimetidine, a
potent cyp3a4 inhibitor, inhibits the metabolism of  xxxd2704xxx , although this had no pharmacodynamic effects as heart
rate and blood pressure were left unaltered [93]. caution
should be exercised when  xxxd2704xxx  is combined with other
negative inotropic and negative chronotropic drugs, such as
cca, digoxin and amiodarone. there are no data on the
safety and/or efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  in patients with hepatic or
renal impairment, so these conditions should prompt caution
in prescribing  xxxd2704xxx .
bradycardia is a concern with all beta-blockers, although it
must be mentioned that in a high-risk population, the
seniors participants, only 18 out of 1067 patients had to
be withdrawn from study medication due to bradycardia.
the dose of  xxxd2704xxx  tolerated by a patient predicts
prognosis. this is described in a recent substudy of the

seniors [94], reporting the relation between the dose
tolerated and outcome in patients with heart failure. patients
who could not tolerate the starting dose of  xxxd2704xxx , or only
a very low dose of  xxxd2704xxx , have a worse prognosis.
regulatory affairs
 xxxd2704xxx  has been registered for hypertension in europe and
the us since a long time. after the seniors trial was
published,  xxxd2704xxx  was mentioned in the guidelines for
heart failure of the european society for cardiology as an
alternative for metoprolol, bisoprolol or carvedilol.

conclusion
in conclusion,  xxxd2704xxx  has shown equal or better antihypertensive efficacy to other antihypertensive agents, whereas tolerability is generally good. it is of note that in the comparative
trials with enalapril, lisinopril and losartan, the comparative
drugs were relatively underdosed. the effects of  xxxd2704xxx  on
clinical outcomes in hypertensive subjects have yet to be
investigated.
in heart failure,  xxxd2704xxx  has a proven efficacy in a subset
of heart failure patients (i.e., the elderly and some patients
with relatively preserved left ventricular systolic function).

expert opinion

 xxxd2704xxx  is a third generation beta-blocker with high selectivity
for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor and with distinct vasodilatory properties related to no modulation. it has been registered for
hypertension and heart failure.
first, what is the position of  xxxd2704xxx  in the first-line
treatment of hypertension? it is important to realise that the
role of beta-blockers as first-line treatment for hypertension has
been challenged. a recent meta-analysis explored the role of
beta-blocker trials in patients with primary hypertension [8].
the authors ultimately analysed data from 13 randomised
controlled trials of beta-blockers versus other antihypertensive
drugs (105,951 patients) and 7 randomised controlled trials
of beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment
(27,433 patients). the other antihypertensives included
ace-i, arbs and ccas. the risk for stroke was
significantly higher for beta-blockers than for other antihypertensive drugs (rr = 1.16; ci = 1.04 – 1.30) and also
specifically for atenolol than for other non-beta-blocker antihypertensives (rr = 1.26; ci = 1.15 – 1.38). for
non-atenolol beta-blockers, data were inconclusive due to the
small number of clinical events. for mi and all-cause
mortality risks, differences between beta-blockers and other
antihypertensives were not significant. stroke risk was
significantly lower with beta-blockers than with placebo or no
treatment (rr = 0.81; 95% ci = 0.71 – 0.93) but risks for
death and mi were not.
it is important to emphasise that the outcome of this
meta-analysis was dominated by data obtained from trials with
atenolol. other beta-blockers were largely under-represented, and
1546

no trials were included testing third-generation beta-blockers.
therefore, extrapolation from the results from this meta-analysis
to third class beta-blockers (the agents with vasodilating capacities:
 xxxd2704xxx  and carvedilol) is erroneous.
a possible explanation for the lesser efficacy of atenolol may
be that atenolol does not reduce central hypertension as well as
other antihypertensive agents. central blood pressure is an
important predictor for cardiovascular events. the cafe
(conduit artery function evaluation) study [95], involving 2073
ascot participants, prospectively evaluated the effects of
cardiovascular drugs on derived central aortic pressures and
haemodynamics. the atenolol ± thiazide-based treatment
was much less effective than amlodipine ± perindopril-based
treatment at lowering central aortic pressures. these
findings suggest a mechanism explaining why beta-blockers,
specifically atenolol, are less suitable as an optimal treatment
for uncomplicated hypertension.  xxxd2704xxx , on the other
hand, does decrease central resistance, as it increases arterial
distensibility in animals [96] but also in human subjects
with hypertension [17,88].
therefore, with beta-blockers under fire, it is important to
recognise that many beta-blockers, including  xxxd2704xxx , were not
included in the meta-analyses. the inferiority of atenolol may
be explained by its inefficacy to reduce central blood pressure,
which is, in fact, effectively reduced by  xxxd2704xxx . in the
absence of large scale outcome trials with  xxxd2704xxx  in hypertension, a choice for  xxxd2704xxx  should be made on all available
(experimental) data.
where does this leave  xxxd2704xxx  in the treatment of hypertension? presently, beta-blockers cannot be recommended as
first choice antihypertensive agents. most patients with
hypertension need two to three drugs for adequate blood
pressure control. in other words, beta-blockers will be used in
hypertension, albeit to a lesser extent. for patients whose
hypertension cannot be controlled with one or two drugs,
addition of a beta-blocker is still a good choice.  xxxd2704xxx  has
emerged as a drug with equipotent antihypertensive effects
in comparison with older beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol
bisoprolol, carvedilol). however, it has ancillary effects that
may be of benefit to many patients with hypertension:
vasodilatory properties, decreasing central blood pressure
and the absence of metabolic dysregulation. furthermore, it
is well tolerated. therefore, in patients whose hypertension
cannot be controlled with one or two antihypertensive
drugs, addition of  xxxd2704xxx  should be considered.
there are some questions that still remain. first, there is a
paucity of trials that tested efficacy and safety of  xxxd2704xxx 
on top of other drugs in patients with hypertension.
although we know from trials with  xxxd2704xxx  in patients
with heart failure that it seems safe and efficacious to add
 xxxd2704xxx  to ace-i, diuretics and cca, it would be of
interest to obtain such data. second, we do not know if the
ancillary effects of  xxxd2704xxx  translate into a lower event rate.
in hypertension, it is extremely difficult to conduct
comparative trials as this requires large patient numbers.

nevertheless, it would be the ultimate proof to test if the
proclaimed ancillary effects of  xxxd2704xxx  translate into better
clinical efficacy.
third,  xxxd2704xxx  is registered for heart failure. it seems to
have a particularly good profile for this disease, as it is blocks
the sympathetic nervous system, is antihypertensive and is
also vasodilatory. with increasing age, and a higher prevalence
of heart failure with mildly depressed left ventricular systolic
function in the community, the indication for the use of
 xxxd2704xxx  is likely to grow.
but this is only one trial in a specific patient group. we do
not have many data on the effects of  xxxd2704xxx  on surrogate
parameters that predict disease outcome in heart failure, such as
left ventricular geometry, plasma neurohormones, and (serial)
exercise capacity. some substudies of the seniors will come
out shortly, and it is hoped that these will clarify some matters.
other uncertainties remain. first, we do not have data about
the efficacy of  xxxd2704xxx  in younger patients. however, it is
conceivable that if anything, the elderly would benefit less from

 xxxd2704xxx . second, we do not know just how important the no
release is. from its properties (beta-blocker and no-releaser), one
might speculate that  xxxd2704xxx  should have more effect than
‘just’ a beta-blocker, but the risk reduction in the seniors trial
is not higher (rather lower) than for carvedilol, metoprolol or
bisoprolol. to explain this question, one can imagine that
various mixtures are tested with increasing amounts of the
l-isomer that bears most of the vasodilatory effect. it may be
possible to have several racemic mixtures ready to provide the
patient with a tailor-made pharmacological approach.
for now,  xxxd2704xxx  should be considered as an alternative
(co-) treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension and as a
first choice for mild-to-moderate heart failure, especially in
the elderly.
