abstract
background: chronic treatment with the dual serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (snri) duloxetine reduces the density of serotonin
transporter sites in cortex and engenders an anxiolytic-like response. to determine the reproducibility of these effects and their generality to other
antidepressants we compared the effects of chronic duloxetine treatment with another snri, venlafaxine, and two selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, paroxetine and fluoxetine.
methods: separate groups of mice were administered vehicle, fluoxetine (15 mg/kg), paroxetine, duloxetine or venlafaxine (10 mg/kg) perorally
twice daily for 28 days and tested in the mouse zero-maze and in motility cages on days 21 and 22, respectively, to determine effects on anxiety
and motor activity. on day 28 brains were analysed for serotonin transporter (sert) density in cortex and noradrenaline transporter (net) density
in cortex and hippocampus.
results: duloxetine and fluoxetine both reduced sert density in cortex and induced anxiolytic-like effects. paroxetine had an identical profile,
but it is unclear if this drug down-regulated the sert since extensive washing of cortical tissue did not remove all drug. venlafaxine had no effect
on behavioural or biochemical parameters. only duloxetine reduced net density in cortex, although not hippocampus.
conclusions: the reduction in sert density and anxiolytic-like effects with duloxetine, fluoxetine and, potentially, paroxetine suggest that downregulation of the sert may be a relevant mechanism in therapeutic response to these antidepressants.

1. introduction
although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and
serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (snris) are
effective in the treatment of mood disorders such as depression
and anxiety, clinical improvement is only seen after 3–6 weeks
of treatment (nutt, 2005). this delayed onset of clinical efficacy
in mood disorders occurs despite the fact that ssris and snris
acutely inhibit the serotonin transporter (sert, hrdina et al.,
1985; benmansour et al., 2002), and in the case of snris also
the noradrenaline transporter (net, rehavi et al., 1982;
benmansour et al., 2004). therefore, events or adaptations
beyond the acute inhibition of monoamine transporters must be

necessary for clinical efficacy. the necessity for downregulation/desensitisation of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors in the raphe nucleus and 5-ht1b autoreceptors located
on the terminals of serotonergic neurons, after chronic but not
acute antidepressant treatment have been proposed as potential
mechanisms to explain the delay in therapeutic efficacy (rausch
et al., 2006; clark and neumaier, 2001).
a direct role for the primary target of many antidepressants,
i.e. the sert, has been implicated in affective disorders. for
example, lesch et al. (1996) showed genetic variation in the
human sert, viz a common polymorphism in the promoter
region of the gene coding for sert, leading to short and long
variants. the consequence is a greater expression of sert in
subjects homozygous for the long allele compared to those with
the short variant as assessed in-vitro using human lymphoblast
cell lines, post mortem tissue and also from brain imaging
studies (lesch et al., 1996; greenberg et al., 1999; heinz et al.,
2000); although it is important to emphasize that not all studies

n.r. mirza et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 31 (2007) 858–866

report such a relationship between polymorphic variant and
sert expression (zalsman et al., 2005; mann et al., 2000).
nonetheless, some studies have shown an association between
the short allele form of sert and heightened anxiety in man
(lesch et al., 1996; lesch and mossner, 1998; katsuragi et al.,
1999). similarly, sert knockout mice demonstrate heightened
anxiety in some animal models (holmes et al., 2003).
recently we (troelsen et al., 2005) demonstrated that the
snri duloxetine engendered an anxiolytic-like response in the
mouse zero-maze after chronic treatment for 21 days (10 mg/kg,
po twice a day). in these same animals there was a significant
reduction in the density of the sert in frontal cortex whereas
there was no effect on net density in the hippocampus. these
findings have been verified by gould et al. (2006a) who
administered duloxetine to rats via osmotic mini-pumps and
demonstrated a reduction in sert density but not net density
in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. thus despite
the difference between the studies in terms of species, route of
administration and sacrifice time after treatment the selective
effect of duloxetine on sert density are qualitatively the same.
in addition we previously showed a reduction in the
functional status of somatodendritic 5-ht1a autoreceptors and
terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptors in animals treated chronically
with duloxetine (troelsen et al., 2005) by demonstrating a
truncated hypothermic response to systemically administered 8ohdpat and mcpp, respectively (maj and moryl, 1992, 1993;
hagan et al., 1997). in contrast to duloxetine, chronic treatment
with either the ssri citalopram or the tricyclic antidepressant
amitriptyline had no effect in the zero-maze despite both
treatment regimens similarly resulting in a truncated hypothermic response to 8-ohdpat and mcpp in mice, which was
equal to or greater than that attained with chronic duloxetine
treatment. moreover, whilst both citalopram and amitriptyline
reduced cortical sert density the magnitude of this effect was
small (∼ 20%) compared to that seen with duloxetine (∼ 70%).
we suggested that the lack of an anxiolytic response to
citalopram and amitriptyline was due to a modest reduction in
sert density engendered by these drugs compared to
duloxetine.
since citalopram has a short half-life in mice (fredricson,
1982) compared to duloxetine (troelsen et al., 2005), lower invivo exposure to the former drug may have precluded seeing
behavioural and biochemical effects demonstrated with duloxetine. however, rather than re-test citalopram at higher doses,
for greater length or increased frequency, in the current study we
opted to test the ssris paroxetine and fluoxetine which have
longer half-lives in mouse than citalopram (hirano et al., 2004,
2005; holladay et al., 1998; bourin et al., 2001), to verify the
assertion that a reduction in sert density is necessary for an
anxiolytic-like response in the mouse zero-maze. previous
studies in rats have shown that chronic administration of ssris
to rats via osmotic mini-pumps reduces sert but not net
density in various brain regions (benmansour et al., 1999,
2004). furthermore, it was surprising that in our previous study
we saw no effect of the snri duloxetine on net density in the
hippocampus. therefore we also assessed the effects of these
compounds on net density in the hippocampus and cortex.

since the snri duloxetine was active in our animal model of
anxiety after chronic treatment, we were interested to ascertain
if another snri venlafaxine, which is marketed as an anxiolytic
(nutt, 2005), would also induce an anxiolytic-like response in
mice and, if so, whether this drug also reduced sert density.
although both venlafaxine and duloxetine are snris, venlafaxine has 100–300 fold lower affinity for the sert and net
compared to duloxetine (bymaster et al., 2001). whether these
potency differences between the two snris are relevant to the
parameters of the present study are unclear, although gould et
al. (2006a,b) have demonstrated that unlike duloxetine,
venlafaxine administered to rats for 21 days via osmotic minipumps does not engender any change in the density of either the
sert or net in various brain regions.
it is worth noting that relative to the effects of acute
antidepressant administration, few studies have assessed the
effects of chronic antidepressant treatment in animal models of
anxiety, and little data exist on the effects of venlafaxine and
duloxetine per se in anxiety models. moreover, an anxiolyticlike response to antidepressants of various classes after chronic
treatment in animal models has rarely been reported (see review
by borsini et al., 2002; li et al., 2006; ripoll et al., 2006). also,
although others have shown that chronic treatment with
antidepressants downregulates the sert in adult rodents
(benmansour et al., 1999; hirano et al., 2005) and suggested
this may be relevant to their therapeutic effect this has not
generally been vindicated with the use of available animal
models of anxiety or depression (but see thakker et al., 2005).
therefore, the current study combines behavioural measures of
anxiety and motor activity in mice with determination of sert
density in cortex, as well as net density in hippocampus and
cortex, after chronic treatment with fluoxetine, paroxetine,
duloxetine and venlafaxine.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and housing
female nmri mice (harlan scandinavia) weighing 20–25 g
were housed and habituated for 7 days before experiments in
macrolon iii cages (20 × 40 × 18 cm) holding 6 mice per cage,
with all cages enclosed within a scantainer (scanbur a/s, dk).
such group housing and isolation from male mice is known to
suppress estrus in female mice, i.e. the normal 4–5 day cycling
in female mice is prolonged (whitten 1959 reviewed in ma
et al., 1999; university of california, breeding information,
2007). moreover, under these conditions female mice would be
expected to cycle synchronously (lee–boot effect, see
koyama, 2004). these considerations of housing conditions
and isolation from male mice are relevant since interaction
between the effects of antidepressants and sex hormones on
behavioural, biochemical or neurochemical endpoints have
been suggested, although the literature is inconsistent (fernández-guasti et al., 1999; masswood et al., 1999; gundlah et al.,
1998), including in man (gorman, 2006). food (altromin®)
and tap water were available ad libitum, with lights on at 6 a.m.
and off at 6 p.m. all behavioural testing was conducted during

860

n.r. mirza et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 31 (2007) 858–866

the light phase. all experiments were performed according to
the guidelines of the danish committee for experiments on
animals and the national institute of health guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals (nih publication no. 85–23,
revised 1996).
2.2. drugs and solutions
the following drugs were used in the studies described
below:  xxxd2135xxx  (sigma-aldrich, denmark), paroxetine
fumarate (a gift from glaxosmithkline), duloxetine oxalate and
venlafaxine hcl (synthesized by the medicinal chemistry
department, neurosearch a/s, denmark). all drugs were
dissolved in deionised water.
2.3. experimental protocol
the experimental protocol is the same as that used previously
by troelsen et al. (2005). briefly, separate groups of mice were
administered vehicle, fluoxetine (15 mg/kg), paroxetine,
duloxetine or venlafaxine (the latter three drugs administered
at a dose of 10 mg/kg) perorally twice a day (7 a.m., 7 p.m.) for
28 days at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg. the doses and route of
administration were chosen on the basis of previous studies
showing anxiolytic or antidepressant-like effects of these
compound in rats or mice (kennett et al., 1994; dunn and
swiergiel, 2001; troelsen et al., 2005). mice were tested in the
zero-maze and motility cages (see method descriptions below)
on days 21 and 22, respectively, 2 h after the first drug dose  xxxd2274xxx 
a.m. on these two days. on day 28 the brains of animals were
removed 4 h after the last drug dose  xxxd2274xxx  a.m. and the density of
sert in cortex and net in both cortex and hippocampus, was
determined (see method descriptions below).
2.4. behavioural models
2.4.1. zero-maze (zm)
the potential of test compounds to affect anxiety levels was
evaluated in the mouse zero-maze (tse systems, germany), an
unconditioned conflict model of anxiety (shepherd et al., 1994).
the zero-maze consisted of a circular platform (with a total
diameter of 53 cm and elevated 50 cm above the ground) with
two open areas (wall height 6 mm; wall height adjusted from
manufacturer's original height of 3 mm) and two closed areas
(wall height 11 cm) with a platform diameter of 2.7 cm. the
walls were made of clear perspex®.
the mouse was placed in the closed area facing the closed area
and was allowed to explore the maze for 5 min. the initial latency
to enter the open area with all four paws placed in an open area
was measured. thereafter, the noldus observer programme
(version 2.01, noldus information technology b.v., wageningen,
the netherlands) was used to register the following five events:
time spent in the open area, number of entries into the open areas
(an open area entry was defined as the mouse having all four
paws in an open area), number of stretched-attend postures
(defined as the mouse, whilst situated in a closed area, firstly
exhibiting an elongated body posture resulting in both front paws

and snout crossing over the closed-open divide, and secondly
rapid retraction of the whole body back to the original position),
and number of head dips in the open areas (scanning over the side
of the maze when in the open areas). data for each measure is
presented as a mean± sem. experiments were conducted in
rooms where light levels were set at 5 lux at the level of the maze
(lux meter: yfe, yf-1065, taiwan).
2.4.2. exploratory motility
effect of test compounds on exploratory motility in mice was
measured in automated cages (20 cm × 30 cm, tse, germany)
equipped with infrared sensors (6 × 2). mice were individually
placed in cages for 10 min with automatic recording of activity:
total distance travelled (m) and number of rearing events.
interruption of infrared sensor pairs was detected by a test
control unit with the data recorded on a computer running
actimot software (tse systems, germany). data are presented
as the mean distance travelled or number of rearing events
± sem during the 10 min test.
2.5. transporter density studies
2.5.1. tissue and tissue preparation from animals treated
chronically with fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine and
venlafaxine
tissue was taken from six animals selected randomly in each
treatment group. the mice were decapitated 4–6 h after last
drug administration, and the hippocampi and cerebral cortex
were dissected on ice. the tissues were weighed and stored at
− 20 °c for later assessment of net and sert transporter
density using the radioligands [3h]nisoxetine (81 ci/mmol) and
[3h]citalopram (80 ci/mmol), respectively (amersham biosciences, uk).
the thawed cerebral cortex and hippocampi were homogenized in 20 ml tris–hcl (50 mm, ph 7.4) buffer containing
120 mm nacl and 5 mm kcl. the suspension was centrifuged
at 27,000 ×g for 10 min and the pellet was washed three times
with buffer. the final pellet was re-suspended in the buffer
mentioned above (200 ml per g of original tissue) and used for
[3h]citalopram and [3h]nisoxetine binding assays. preparations
were performed at 0–4 °c unless otherwise indicated.
[3h]citalopram binding was determined using the method
described by plenge and mellerup (1991). in brief, the assay
was performed  xxxd1891xxx  nm [3h]citalopram in a final volume of
550 mul for 60 min at 25 °c in triplicate. non-specific binding
was determined in the presence of 1 mum paroxetine, and binding
was terminated by rapid filtration over filters presoaked in 0.1%
polyethyleneimine.
[3h]nisoxetine binding was determined using the method
described by tejani-butt (1992). in brief, the assay was
performed  xxxd1891xxx  nm [3h]nisoxetine in a final volume of
550 mul for 4 h at 2 °c in triplicate. non-specific binding was
determined in the presence of 10 mum desipramine, and binding
was terminated by rapid filtration over filters presoaked in 0.1%
polyethyleneimine.
the radioactivity on the filters was determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting. binding experiments were

n.r. mirza et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 31 (2007) 858–866

performed using a ligand concentration 8 × the kd value, giving
values that approximate bmax values. data are expressed as
pmol/mg protein.
2.5.2. tissue and tissue preparation from animals treated
acutely with fluoxetine, paroxetine and duloxetine
although the effect of chronic duloxetine treatment on sert
binding density seen by troelsen et al. (2005) and gould et al.
(2006a) are qualitatively the same, in the former study sert
binding density was determined in animals sacrificed 4 h after
final duloxetine dose and brain tissue homogenates washed
three times, whereas in the latter study measurements were
taken 2 days after osmotic mini-pump removal. if the short
interval between final dose and sacrifice and short wash-out
period was insufficient to remove any remaining drug or
metabolite this may explain the low sert density seen after
chronic duloxetine treatment in the study by troelsen et al.
(2005), although as gould et al. (2006a) point out this is
unlikely given that the pattern of effect on sert and net
densities between the two studies is identical.
nonetheless, we partly addressed this issue by conducting a
methodological study to support the main study in which
antidepressants were administered chronically (described
above). in this supporting study separate groups of mice were
administered a single dose of either vehicle, duloxetine (10 mg/
kg, po), fluoxetine (15 mg/kg, po) or paroxetine (10 mg/kg,
po) and brains removed 4 h later. animals from each treatment
group were culled and cortical tissue removed and treated as
described above, except that tissue was washed either once,
twice or three times with buffer (n = 3−6) before sert density
was determined using [3h]citalopram as radioligand. in a
follow-up study two groups of animals were administered

861

duloxetine (10 mg/kg, po) or paroxetine (10 mg/kg, po) and
culled 24 h after a single dose (n = 3–6). cortical tissue was
removed and treated as described above, including washed three
times with buffer prior to measuring sert density.
2.6. data analysis
individual parameters on the zero-maze, motility measures
and transporter density data were all analysed by one-way
anova, followed by post hoc dunnett's test. sigmastat
version 2.03 (san rafael, ca, us) was used for all analysis, and
alpha was set at 0.05.
3. results
3.1. effect of chronic treatment with antidepressants on zeromaze performance in mice (fig. 1)
from fig. 1 it is clear that chronic treatment with some of the
antidepressants for 21 days engendered an anxiolytic-like effect
in the mouse zero-maze. specifically, there was a significant
main effect of treatment on the time spent by animals in the two
open areas (f[4,71] = 7.5, p b 0.001). post hoc dunnett's test
clearly showed that mice treated with fluoxetine (p b 0.01),
paroxetine (p b 0.001) and duloxetine (p b 0.01) spent more time
in the open areas compared to vehicle treated animals (fig. 1a).
mice treated with venlafaxine spent approximately the same
time in the open areas as vehicle treated mice.
analysis of additional measures generally confirmed the
pattern of results described above with some small differences.
thus there was a significant main effect of treatment on both the
number of entries into the open area (f[4,71] = 4.2, p = 0.004)

and the number of head dips in the open area (f[4,71] = 8.5,
p b 0.001). from fig. 1b it is clear that fluoxetine, paroxetine
and duloxetine all increased the number of entries into the open
areas relative to the vehicle treated group. post hoc analysis
confirmed a significant difference compared to vehicle for
fluoxetine (p b 0.05), paroxetine (p b 0.01) and duloxetine
(p b 0.05). similarly, fluoxetine, paroxetine and duloxetine all
increased the number of head dips made by mice in the open
areas (fig. 1c), although post hoc dunnett's test only confirmed
a significant difference between animals treated with either
fluoxetine (p b 0.01) or paroxetine (p b 0.001) relative to mice
treated with vehicle. there was no significant main effect of
treatment on the latency to enter the open areas (f[4,71] = 1.4),
although fig. 1d shows that mice treated with fluoxetine,
paroxetine and duloxetine entered the open areas more rapidly
compared to vehicle treated mice when first placed on the zeromaze. finally, there was no significant main effect of treatment
on the number of saps performed by animals at the closedopen intersections of the maze (f[4,71] = 1.8, fig. 1e).
3.2. effect of chronic treatment with antidepressants on motor
activity in mice
as demonstrated previously (troelsen et al., 2005), chronic
treatment with duloxetine did not affect motor activity in mice,
likely obviating any possible motor confound in interpreting the
anxiolytic-like response we observed with this drug in the zeromaze. moreover, all other drugs tested in the current study had
no effect on motor activity after chronic administration for
22 days. thus, there was no significant main effect of treatment
on either total distance travelled (f[4,65] = 2.5) or the number of
rearing events (f[4,65] = 1.4) in a 10 min test in activity cages
(data not shown).
3.3. effect of chronic treatment with antidepressants on
 xxxg2099xxx  density in cortex and hippocampus in
mice (fig. 2)
3.3.1. [3h]citalopram binding in cortex (fig. 2a)
after chronic treatment with antidepressants for 28 days
there was a clear reduction in sert density in the cortex of
animals that had been treated with fluoxetine, paroxetine and

duloxetine (fig. 2a). the data for duloxetine corresponds with
what we have previously observed with this drug (troelsen et
al., 2005). analysis of variance showed a significant main effect
of treatment (f[4,26] = 24.5, p b 0.001), and a post hoc test
confirmed that duloxetine (p b 0.01), fluoxetine (p b 0.001) and
paroxetine (p b 0.001) all significantly reduced sert density in
the cortex relative to the vehicle treated group. there was no
effect of venlafaxine.
3.3.2. [3h]nisoxetine binding in hippocampus (fig. 2b)
chronic treatment with antidepressants in this study for
28 days had no effect on the density of the net in hippocampus
(f[4,29] = 1.4). the lack of effect of duloxetine confirms our
previous observations (troelsen et al., 2005).
3.3.3. [3h]nisoxetine binding in cortex (fig. 2c)
since in our earlier study and in the current study we did not
observe any effect of duloxetine on the density of the net in the
hippocampus, despite this drug possessing an snri profile, in
the present study we also assessed net density in the cortex. in
contrast to a lack of treatment effect on net density in the
hippocampus, there was a significant main effect of treatment
on net density in the cortex (f[4,26] = 9.3, p b 0.001). post hoc
analysis demonstrated that this was attributable to a selective
reduction in net density in the cortex in mice treated for
28 days with duloxetine (p b 0.001) compared to vehicle treated
mice. no other drugs affected net density in the cortex.
3.4. [3h]citalopram binding in cortex from animals treated
with a single dose of either fluoxetine, paroxetine or
duloxetine: influence of (a) frequency of washing cortical
tissue and (b) delay between final dose and tissue removal
(fig. 3)
from fig. 3a it is clear that whereas [3h]citalopram binding
to cortex from animals treated with an acute dose of duloxetine
or fluoxetine and culled 4 h later had returned to vehicle
baseline levels after 2–3 washes with buffer, this was not the
case for cortical tissue derived from animals treated acutely with
paroxetine and culled 4 h later. indeed, even after 3 washes with
buffer, [3h]citalopram binding had barely returned to 25% of
baseline levels clearly indicating that this procedure is

delay between dosing and removal of cortical tissue on recovery of [3h]citalopram binding to vehicle control levels in mice treated with a single dose of either prx,

purposes. data are presented as % of vehicle levels ± sem (n = 3–6 per group, see method section for more details).

inadequate to fully wash off any remaining endogenous
paroxetine. in a follow-up study (fig. 3b) it can be seen that
[3h]citalopram binding does return to vehicle baseline levels if
mice are treated acutely with paroxetine and a delay of 24 h is
incorporated between final dose and removal of cortical tissue
which is washed three times with buffer. by contrast, [3h]
citalopram binding to cortical tissue derived from animals treated
with duloxetine returns to baseline levels irrespective of whether
cortical tissue is removed 4 h or 24 h after dosing (fig. 3a and b).
4. discussion
the current study replicates our findings with duloxetine in a
recent publication (troelsen et al., 2005), where we demonstrated that 3–4 weeks administration of this snri induced an
anxiolytic-like response in mice and a reduction in sert
density in mouse cortex. importantly, the current study adds
some weight to the idea that a reduction in sert density after
chronic treatment with some monoamine reuptake inhibitors
might lead to an anxiolytic-like response. thus, like duloxetine
the two ssris fluoxetine and paroxetine induced an anxiolyticlike response in mice after 3-weeks chronic treatment with no
effect on locomotor activity. moreover, analysis of the brains of
animals from these treatment groups showed a n 40% reduction
in cortical sert density. the positive response on both
behavioural and biochemical parameters with the two ssris
differs from our previous experience with citalopram which had
no anxiolytic-like effect in mice and only induced a modest
reduction in cortical sert density. this might suggest that
modest reductions in sert density are insufficient to engender
an anxiolytic-like response, at least in the mouse zero-maze.
the lack of effect of venlafaxine (current study) and the small
effects of amitriptyline and citalopram, demonstrated previously
(troelsen et al., 2005), on cortical sert density were also
associated with a lack of anxiolytic response. however, our data
with respect to paroxetine must be treated cautiously since an
additional methodological study clearly showed that this drug
was difficult to “wash-off” from brain tissue when animals were
culled 4 h after a single dose of 10 mg/kg, although a delay of
24 h was sufficient.
as outlined in the introduction, the role of the sert in
affective disorders is clear from both clinical and preclinical

studies. clinical studies show that humans homozygous for the
short allelic form of the sert have a lower expression and
function of the transporter compared to humans with the long
form, and that those carrying the short form have heightened
anxiety (hariri et al., 2006). this finding tallies well with
preclinical studies showing that sert knockout mice have
increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze. however, our
findings would appear to be at odds with this literature since we
demonstrate that reduced sert density, and presumably
function (benmansour et al., 1999, 2002), after chronic
antidepressant treatment leads to an anxiolytic-like response
in mice. however, our data are complemented by the recent
findings of thakker et al. (2005) who have demonstrated that 2weeks of direct intracerebroventricular infusion of citalopram
into adult mouse brain leads to an antidepressant-like effect in
the mouse forced swim test and a widespread reduction in sert
density in brain. importantly, these authors also demonstrated a
similar antidepressant response and reduction in sert density
after 2-weeks direct brain infusion of sirna targeting mrna
coding for sert. thus, down-regulation of the sert in
adulthood as a consequence of chronic treatment with
antidepressants leads to an anxiolytic/antidepressant-like response, whereas a lack of sert during development in mice
(holmes et al., 2003) or lower levels of sert in some humans
carrying the short allelic form of the sert (hariri et al., 2006),
leads to heightened affective symptoms.
the reduction in sert density we see with duloxetine, and
potentially paroxetine, in mice has been demonstrated by others
in rodents using osmotic mini-pumps to maintain plasma
concentrations at levels seen at steady state in clinical studies
(gould et al., 2006a; hirano et al., 2005; benmansour et al.,
1999), since antidepressants generally have longer half-lives in
humans compared to rodents (hiemke and hartter, 2000;
devane, 1999). from this perspective the use of systemic
injections in the current study is not ideal, and the short halflives of drugs such as citalopram, amitriptyline and venlafaxine
in rodents (fredricson, 1982; coudore et al., 1996; howell
et al., 1994), might explain why we have been unable to
demonstrate robust reductions in sert density and/or behavioural response with these specific drugs. however, venlafaxine administered via osmotic mini-pumps at low (15 mg/kg/day)
and high doses (70 mg/kg/day), anticipating this compound's

864

n.r. mirza et al. / progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry 31 (2007) 858–866

selective serotonergic and mixed serotonergic/noradrenergic
effects at these two dose levels, respectively, failed to affect
either sert or net density in rat brain (gould et al., 2006b).
moreover, in the same study amitriptyline administered via
osmotic mini-pumps had no effect on sert or net density in
rat brain, and we have reported only small reductions in sert
density in mouse cortex after chronic treatment with amitriptyline (troelsen et al., 2005). furthermore, irrespective of
duloxetine administered to rats via osmotic mini-pumps (gould
et al., 2006a) or administered systemically (current study and
troelsen et al., 2005), there is a reduction in sert density in
cortex but no effect on net density in hippocampus. therefore,
for duloxetine, venlafaxine and amitriptyline route of administration does not appear to be a major factor with respect to
effect on sert density.
this is not to imply that the literature is consistent in
showing antidepressant induced changes in monoamine
transporter levels. for example, after chronic systemic
administration of citalopram (10 mg/kg, i.p., 14 days) or
fluoxetine (15 mg/kg, i.p., 21 days) to rats gobbi et al. (1997)
reported no change in [3 h]citalopram binding, whereas
hrdina and vu (1993) reported an increase in [3h]paroxetine
binding in rat cortex and hippocampus after chronic
fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p., 21 days). moreover,
our data with fluoxetine, after peroral administration, shows
that this drug reduces [3h]citalopram binding in cortex. to
the best of our knowledge the effect of fluoxetine on sert
density in rodent brain after administration via osmotic minipumps has not been reported. although these highlighted
examples suggest that methodological differences such as test
species and route of administration are variables that may
account for the differences in effect on sert density between
studies, brain region analysed may also be relevant. thus,
whereas we and others have previously demonstrated that
duloxetine reduces sert density in cortex but not net
density in hippocampus irrespective of species (mouse/rat) or
route of administration (peroral/osmotic mini-pump), in the
current study we not only reproduced this pattern of effects
but demonstrated a clear reduction in net density in the
cortex of animals treated with duloxetine (fig. 2c; gould et
al., 2006a; troelsen et al., 2005).
one important aspect of the current and another recent
study, is that robust antidepressant induced reductions in
sert density in mouse brain have been related to
antidepressant (thakker et al., 2005) and anxiolytic (troelsen
et al., 2005) like effects of these drugs using validated
animal models of these disorders (porsolt et al., 1977;
shepherd et al., 1994). in the studies from our group
behaviour and binding are assessed in the same animals,
although  xxxg2099xxx  density is determined
1 week after behavioural studies have been completed,
indicating only a causal relationship. nonetheless, these data
are relevant since as outlined in the introduction there is a
paucity of positive data with respect to, (i) the effect of
antidepressants after chronic treatment in animal models per
se; and (ii) effects of antidepressants in animal models of
anxiety specifically (borsini et al., 2002).

the important question is whether the down-regulation of
the sert in cortex that we and others report in preclinical
studies can be translated to man and what it may mean. human
positron emission tomography studies using sert radiotracers
show that high transporter occupancy (∼ 80%) with long term
(weeks) ssri treatment is necessary for therapeutic response
(meyer et al., 2001, 2004). however, since such high sert
occupancy levels can be attained with antidepressants such as
sertraline and duloxetine even after short treatment periods
(≤ 1 week, parsey et al., 2006; takano et al., 2006), level of
sert occupancy is not indicative of therapeutic response per
se. adaptations that occur during high levels of sert
occupancy over weeks of ssri treatment, e.g., reduced
sensitivity of 5-ht1a or 5-ht1b receptors, decreased sert
density etc. leading to an apparent increase in forebrain 5-ht
levels, have been purported to be the mechanism behind the
therapeutic effectiveness of chronic and not acute ssri
treatment (see references in introduction). however, whilst
such mechanisms have been demonstrated in preclinical studies,
they have not been irrefutably proven in man for various,
including pragmatic, reasons. nonetheless, a recent study in
human volunteers treated for b1 week with sertraline suggested
that a down-regulation of the sert might occur in man after
chronic treatment (parsey et al., 2006), although this inference
was based on a modified method for analysing the data to allow
for comparison with an earlier study (meyer et al., 2004).
one potential avenue worth pursuing might be to compare
sert density in humans in remission and those that suffer a
relapse/discontinuation of symptom's after a course of antidepressant treatment, since it is recognised that antidepressants
differ on these outcome measures (thase et al., 2001; bogetto et
al., 2002). benmansour et al. (2002) have demonstrated that
chronic treatment of rats with sertraline induces both a time
dependent reduction in sert density throughout the brain
during treatment, and a converse time dependent recovery of
sert density when drug treatment is halted. it would be
interesting to assess the behaviour of animals during recovery of
sert density in animal models of anxiety and depression to
better understand the role of sert down-regulation in
therapeutic response.
in conclusion, the current study shows that duloxetine and
fluoxetine engendered a significant reduction in sert density
in mouse cortex and that this was associated with an
anxiolytic-like response in mice exposed to a zero-maze.
although similar biochemical and behavioural effects were
seen with paroxetine our biochemical data for this drug
should be treated equivocally since this drug is difficult to
wash off from our brain preparations, possibly as a
consequence of paroxetine's exceptionally high affinity for
the sert compared to other ssris (owens et al., 1997).
venlafaxine had no effect on either sert or net density in
mouse brain, and no effect was observed in the mouse zeromaze with this drug. finally, only duloxetine selectively
reduced net density in cortex although not hippocampus,
suggesting this compounds snri designation is brain region
dependent; although the mechanism for this brain region
selectivity is unclear.
