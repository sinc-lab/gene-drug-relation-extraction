neurotransporters play central roles in the overall process of
neurotransmission. sodium-coupled plasma membrane transporters actively remove the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft in a step essential for termination of the signal. the
release of neurotransmitter by exocytosis is possible because of
their storage inside synaptic vesicles in a process that depends
on vesicular h⫹-coupled neurotransporters (vnt)2 (1). three

families of proteins responsible for the uptake of transmitter by
secretory vesicles have been identified, one that includes the
vesicular monoamine transporters (vmats) and acetylcholine
transporters (vacht), a second that includes the vesicular
gaba transporter ( xxxg2137xxx ), and a third that includes the vesicular glutamate transporters (vgluts) (2– 4).
two monoamine transporters,  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2, are
responsible for the transport of dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, and noradrenaline into the synaptic vesicles of neurons
and the dense core vesicles of endocrine cells (2– 4). vmat2 is
expressed by monoamine neurons in the central nervous system and selected peripheral endocrine populations. vmat2
has a higher affinity for most monoamines than  xxxg2098xxx , but
only vmat2 appears to recognize histamine (5, 6). early studies using chromaffin granules from the adrenal medulla showed
that the uptake of one protonated, and hence charged, cytoplasmic monoamine is coupled to the movement of two h⫹ in the
opposite direction (1). the transport cycle results in net efflux
of one charge. the h⫹ electrochemical gradient and the coupled stoichiometry allow for accumulation of monoamines at
submolar concentrations in chromaffin granules (1).
the vmats are the target of reserpine, which provided
some of the first evidence for the monoamine hypothesis for
depression (7, 8) and are involved in the function of amphetamines including methamphetamine, which acts primarily
on dopamine neurons, and 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma), which promotes serotonin release (9). the
vmats also protect cells against the parkinsonian neurotoxin
mpp⫹ (10, 11) by sequestering the compound in vesicles and
away from its primary site of action in mitochondria.
another clinically relevant drug is the non-competitive
vmat2 inhibitor  xxxd3330xxx  that is used in the treatment of various
movement disorders including tourette syndrome and huntington chorea (12).  xxxd3330xxx  is a non-competitive inhibitor of
transport and substrate binding (13). however, occupancy of
the substrate binding site has little effect on  xxxd3330xxx  binding (13,
14). the mode of interaction of the two binding sites and how
 xxxd3330xxx  brings about the inhibition are still unknown. the closely
related  xxxg2098xxx  isoform displays a decreased sensitivity to  xxxd3330xxx 
(6).
the structural basis for the function of  xxxg2099xxx  remains
unknown.  xxxg2099xxx  belongs to the mfs superfamily of transporters and it displays a weak but distinct homology with bacterial
amine transporter;  xxxd3330xxx ,  xxxd3330xxx ; fm 4-64, n-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylamino-phenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide; tm,

the vesicular  xxxg2148xxx  vmat2 is responsible for the transport of monoamines into synaptic and
storage vesicles. vmat2 is the target of many psychoactive
drugs and is essential for proper neurotransmission and survival. here we describe a new expression system in saccharomyces cerevisiae that takes advantage of the polyspecificity of
vmat2. expression of rvmat2 confers resistance to acriflavine and to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mppⴙ) by their removal into the yeast vacuole. this
expression system allowed identification of a new substrate,
acriflavine, and isolation of mutants with modified affinity to
 xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx ), a non-competitive inhibitor of vmat2
that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders
including tourette syndrome and huntington chorea. whereas
one type of mutant obtained displayed decreased affinity to
 xxxd3330xxx , a second type showed only a slight decrease in the affinity
to  xxxd3330xxx , displayed a higher km to the neurotransmitter serotonin, but conferred increased resistance to acriflavine and
mppⴙ. a protein where both types of mutations were combined
(with only three amino acid replacements) lost most of the properties of the  xxxg2148xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx -insensitive, no
transport of neurotransmitter) but displayed enhanced resistance to the above toxicants. the work described here shows that
in the case of rvmat2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of
function (such as serotonin transport and  xxxd3330xxx  binding) bring
about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to
toxic compounds. a process that has taken millions of years of
evolution can be reversed by three mutations.

experimental procedures
yeast strains and construction of yeast expression vector
rvmat2 cdna with six histidine residues at the n terminus
was cloned in the paes426 yeast expression plasmid, under the
control of the  xxxg72xxx  ( xxxg110xxx ) promoter. the
plasmid contains the ura3 gene for selection in yeast, ampicillin-resistance marker and a 2-micron replication in yeast (35).
cloning was done using pcr, with hindiii and spei restriction
enzymes. c-terminal gfp fusion was constructed using
pfa6a-gfp(s65t)-kanmx6 according to ref. 36. site-directed
mutagenesis was done with the quikchange威 ii site-directed
mutagenesis kit (stratagene). plasmid paes426 with or without his rvmat2 and derived mutants were routinely transformed into yeast strain adu1-7 (us50 –18c, yor1⌬, snq2d,
pdr5⌬, pdr10⌬, pdr11⌬, ycf1⌬, pdr3⌬, ura3). the ura3 mutation in adu1-7 was introduced to the original  xxxg178xxx -7 (16),
kindly supplied by dr. stanislav ulaszewski (wroclav university), using 5-fluoroorotic acid (37).

drug sensitivity assay—s. cerevisiae strains were pregrown
in liquid minimal medium to late log phase. cultures were
diluted to a comparable density and then were decimal diluted.
dilutions (5 ␮l) were placed on ypd agar supplemented as indicated with the appropriate toxins or inhibitors: 40 ␮m acriflavine, 1.5 mm mpp⫹, 0.1– 0.5 ␮m reserpine, or 2 ␮m  xxxd3330xxx . plates
were incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °c.
phenotype in liquid medium—overnight cultures in minimal medium were diluted in ypd or in the same medium (for
mpp⫹ resistance) to a600 ⫽ 0.05 and supplemented with the
corresponding toxic compounds and inhibitors. growth (3 ml)
was performed in 1.5 ⫻ 15 cm glass tubes or in 1.2 ml storage
plates (abgene), 200 ␮l per well, covered with gas permeable
adhesive seal (fig. 8, b and c). the absorbance at 600 nm was
measured after overnight growth at 30 °c. data analysis was
performed using origin 8.0 software (originlab, northampton, ma). the lowest r2 value in the fits for all of the experiments was 0.95.
scanning laser confocal microscopy
cells were scanned using the fv-1000 confocal microscope
(olympus, japan), equipped with an ix81 inverted microscope.
a 60⫻/1.35 oil immersion objective was used. gfp fluorescence was imaged using the 488-nm laser line for excitation and
a 505–525-nm filter was used to collect the emission. vacuolar
staining with the dye n-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylamino-phenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (fm
4-64) was as described in ref. 17. the fm 4-64-stained sample
was scanned using the 633-nm laser line for excitation, and a
655–755-nm filter was used to collect the emission. dic images
were taken at the same time.
biochemical characterization of rvmat2
membranes were prepared from yeast cells essentially as
described (21). the binding of ␣-[2-3h]dihydrotetrabenazine
(american radiolabeled chemicals, st. louis, mo) was performed essentially as described in ref. 22. the procedure
for solubilization, purification, reconstitution, and uptake of
[3h]serotonin (perkinelmer life science) to proteoliposomes
was performed as in ref. 18.

media

generation of random mutant library

s. cerevisiae cells were grown in standard medium. rich
medium (ypd) contained 1% bacto yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone (both from difco), and 2% glucose. minimal medium (sd;
0.67% bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2%
glucose) was supplemented according to auxotrophic requirements as described in ref. 38. yeast cells were transformed by
the method of elble (39).

the library was generated using genemorph威 ii ezclone
domain mutagenesis kit (stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

phenotype assay
inhibition zone assay—s. cerevisiae strains were pregrown
in liquid minimal medium to late log phase and inoculated on
ypd plates. sterile filter discs of 5-mm diameter were loaded
with the desired amount of potential drugs and placed on the
agar. the relative degree of drug resistance was determined by
comparing the diameters of the inhibition zone after incubating
the plates for 2–3 days at 30 °c.

screening procedures
the dna library (1.5 ␮g) was transformed to adu1-7 yeast
cells by liac-heat shock transformation. at the end of the process, cells were plated on minimal medium at a concentration of
5 ⫻ 103-104 cells per plate. replicas on selective plates containing 60 ␮m acriflavine with the addition of 1 or 2 ␮m  xxxd3330xxx  were
done with velvet. enrichment trials were done in liquid
medium, supplemented with 62.5 ␮m acriflavine and 5 ␮m  xxxd3330xxx .
cultures that grew in erlenmeyer flask were plated on minimal
medium without uracil (control for presence of the plasmid),
single colonies were re-plated on plates containing 40 ␮m acriflavine ⫾ 2 ␮m  xxxd3330xxx . rvmat2 wild type was used as a control.

multidrug transporters (1). in addition it became evident from
its pharmacology that it is a multispecific transporter, and,
when heterologously expressed, it confers resistance to toxic
substrates because it removes them from their targets by transport into the vacuolar system (1, 15).
here we describe the functional expression of rvmat2 in
saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. rvmat2 renders the cells resistant to mpp⫹ and acriflavine, a newly identified substrate, by a
process that involves active removal of the drugs into the yeast
vacuole. the development of this system allows us harnessing
the power of yeast genetics to the study of the mechanism of
rvmat2. screening of mutants with altered sensitivity to the
non-competitive inhibitor  xxxd3330xxx  brought about the isolation and
characterization of proteins with a significantly modified pharmacological profile. a mutant rvmat2 was constructed with
three mutations obtained in the above screen. this mutant displayed properties of a multidrug transporter: it conferred a very
robust resistance to acriflavine, mpp⫹ and other drugs but it
lost the ability to transport neurotransmitter or binding the
inhibitor  xxxd3330xxx .

dna was purified from suspected colonies, propagated in escherichia coli, re-purified, and transformed back to the s. cerevisiae adu1-7 strain for the phenotype assay.

results
functional expression of rvmat2 in s. cerevisiae confers
resistance phenotype—the pharmacological profile of  xxxg2099xxx 
(15) and its ability to transport toxic compounds into acidic
organelles enabled the development of a system of functional
expression in s. cerevisiae cells. after screening of yeast strains
that are potentially sensitive to toxic compounds and can then
serve as suitable hosts for phenotypic expression of vmat2, we
chose the strain adu1-7 for routine use (16). adu1-7 is a
strain in which seven genes coding for abc transporters were
inactivated, and it is sensitive to several toxic compounds (16).
initial experiments using an inhibition zone assay allowed for a
quick screen of several plasmids expressing rvmat2 with various tags. we found that cells carrying a plasmid (paes426),
where rvmat2 was expressed at relatively low levels from a
constitutive promoter, were less sensitive to mpp⫹ and acriflavine than the host strain that contained the empty plasmid.
mpp⫹ was already known as a substrate of  xxxg2099xxx  and the
ability of  xxxg2099xxx  to confer resistance to cho cells against the
neurotoxin mpp⫹ was exploited for the cloning of  xxxg2098xxx 
(10). acriflavine is a substrate of several multidrug transporters
but was not previously known to interact with  xxxg2099xxx .
rvmat2 fused to a his6 tag at either n⬘ or c⬘ terminal
showed a similar phenotype as rvmat2 with no tag (not
shown). all the work described here was performed with
rvmat2 fused to a his6 tag at the n terminus of the protein. in
the experiments shown in fig. 1 (a–c), the ability of cells to
grow under various conditions was assessed in solid medium

figure 1. rvmat2 confers resistance against mpp and acriflavine,
which is fully reversed in the presence of  xxxd3330xxx  and reserpine. adu1-7 cells
harboring paes426 with or without rvmat2 were grown in minimal medium
and diluted to comparable densities. after serial dilution, they were plated (5
␮l) on rich solid medium (c) supplemented with 1.5 mm mpp⫹ (a), or 40 ␮m
acriflavine (b). where indicated, the plates contained 2 ␮m  xxxd3330xxx  or 0.5 ␮m
reserpine. growth was analyzed after two overnights incubation at 30 °c.
growth in liquid media was performed as described under “experimental
procedures” with increasing concentrations of acriflavine (d) or mpp⫹ (e), ic50

containing mpp⫹ (1.5 mm) or acriflavine (40 ␮m) in which 5 ␮l
of logarithmic dilutions of an overnight culture were spotted.
all cells tested grew well in the medium without toxicants at all
of the dilutions tested (fig. 1c). in the presence of either mpp⫹
(fig. 1a) or acriflavine (fig. 1b) at the above concentrations,
cells carrying the vector alone did not grow at any of the dilutions. under both conditions, cells carrying rvmat2 displayed
a very robust growth, only slightly lower than growth in the
control plate. full reversal of the resistance to both toxins was
obtained upon addition of the vmat2 inhibitors, reserpine
(0.5 ␮m) or  xxxd3330xxx  (2 ␮m) (fig. 1, a and b). neither one of the
vmat2 inhibitors had any effect on yeast growth in the
absence of the toxin (fig. 1c). to quantify the results described
above, growth was also tested in liquid media and the ic50 for
growth was determined (fig. 1, d and e). whereas growth of
cells with vector alone was inhibited 50% at 12.3 ⫾ 0.6 ␮m
acriflavine and 10 ⫾ 0.5 mm mpp⫹, the ic50 values for the
strain expressing rvmat2 were 23.8 ⫾ 1.2 and 16.3 ⫾ 2,
respectively.
rvmat2 is localized to the vacuolar membrane—to examine the intracellular localization of rvmat2, we constructed a
fusion of rvmat2 with gfp. this construct is fully functional
as judged by its ability to confer resistance against acriflavine
(not shown). vesicular transport activities are energized by a
h⫹ electrochemical gradient (⌬␮h⫹) (1). various organelles
may fulfill the acidic requirements necessary for activity,
among them secretory vesicles, endosomes, and the vacuole.
because the fluorescence associated with this fusion protein
suggested vacuolar localization, we stained the cells with the
lipophilic styryl dye fm 4-64, used as a specific vacuolar membrane marker (17). the results shown in fig. 2, b and c indicate
that a large part of the fluorescence emitted by rvmat2-gfp
was coincident with that of the vacuolar membranes stained
with fm 4-64. in addition, in some cells, expression was detected with a distribution that indicates that some of the protein
is still in the endoplasmic reticulum. therefore, it is possible to
infer that the intracellular compartment to which rvmat2
removes the toxicants is predominantly the cell vacuole. we
assume that the vacuolar-type h⫹-atpase (v-atpase) that
resides on membranes of the vacuole generates a ph gradient
(acidic inside) that drives the accumulation of mpp⫹ and acriflavine inside the organelle.

large vacuole, and confers resistance by actively removing the
toxic compounds away from their target.
random mutagenesis—the functional expression provides a
powerful tool to study rvmat2. to take advantage of the yeast
genetic power we screened for mutants impaired in their ability
to bind  xxxd3330xxx , a high affinity non-competitive inhibitor of
rvmat2. a library of randomly mutagenized rvmat2 was
generated using error prone pcr with mutazyme dna polymerase. random clones sequenced from this library contained
on average 1.2 mutations per rvmat2 reading frame. selection
was performed in yeast cells transformed with the library either
in liquid non-permissive medium or by replica plating. after
screening of a large number of independent clones, two types of
mutants were identified, each one accounted for about 50% of
the total number identified. the first ones (type i) all were
found to contain the same single base substitution: from thymine to cytosine that changes the codon for phenylalanine to
that for leucine at position 136, within the second transmembrane domain. the same mutation was identified in mutants
independently isolated by replica plating.
type i: phenylalanine 136 contributes to high affinity  xxxd3330xxx 
binding—yeast cells expressing rvmat2-f136l maintained
their resistance for growth in the presence of mpp⫹ but displayed a dramatic decrease in the sensitivity to the inhibitor
 xxxd3330xxx  in comparison to wild type (fig. 3, a and b). growth in the
presence of the competitive inhibitor reserpine was not detected suggesting that the mutation affects differentially the
inhibitor profile (fig. 3). the mutant conferred a slightly better
resistance to acriflavine than the wild type (figs. 3c and 4a).

rvmat2 binds  xxxd3330xxx  and transports serotonin—to estimate
the amounts of functional protein in the cells and to further
characterize its properties, we measured binding to the radiolabeled substrate [3h]tbzoh, an analog of  xxxd3330xxx , the high affinity non-competitive inhibitor of vmat2 (13). the cell lysates
displayed nanomolar affinity tbzoh binding, with a kd of
9.4 ⫾ 2 nm. when using ⬃100 ␮g of total membrane protein
(obtained from about 8 –10 ml culture) a bmax value of ⬃0.64
pmol binding sites was obtained. the expression levels estimated from this data are very low and correspond to only a few
␮g from 1 liter of culture. efforts to improve expression using
plasmids with stronger promoters reduced and impaired the
ability of the cells to confer resistance to the toxic compounds,
and membrane preparations from these cells showed little or no
binding of [3h]tbzoh (data not shown).
the resistance of the transformed cells to mpp⫹ and acriflavine, together with [3h]tbzoh binding activity, suggests that
the protein is functional. to further characterize the activity,
we measured transport of serotonin in proteoliposomes. for
this purpose we solubilized the membrane preparation with
dodecylmaltoside (ddm), immobilized rvmat2 onto ni- xxxd2739xxx  beads and reconstituted the transporter into
proteoliposomes. the proton gradient (acidic inside) was generated by imposition of an ammonium gradient (high inside), a
procedure that takes advantage of the higher permeability of
the non-protonated species that rapidly leaks downhill (18).
proteoliposomes prepared from s. cerevisiae cells expressing
rvmat2 displayed time-dependent and proton-driven [3h]serotonin transport (supplemental fig.  xxxd3227xxx ). the kinetic constants obtained from rate determination at various [3h]serotonin concentrations are shown in table 1 (see also supplemental
fig. s1b). the km value of 180 ⫾ 27 nm is similar to the km
measured in vesicles isolated from mammalian cell lines expressing vmat2 (6, 18) and ⬃10 times lower than the value
measured in native vmat2 purified from bovine chromaffin
granules and reconstituted in proteoliposomes (19).
the resistance to mpp⫹ and acriflavine together with the
vacuolar localization and the biochemical characterization of
rvmat2 support the conclusion that the transporter
expressed in s. cerevisiae is fully functional. rvmat2 is targeted to acidic compartments in the yeast cell, mostly to the

centrations of  xxxd3330xxx , rvmat-f136l cells were found to be significantly less sensitive toward the inhibitor with ic50 values of
0.13 ⫾ 0.05 and 6.4 ⫾ 1.2 ␮m, respectively for wild type and
mutant (figs. 3d and 4b). importantly, both strains showed a
small difference in sensitivity to  xxxd2419xxx  and no significant
one in sensitivity toward reserpine (fig. 4, c and d). reserpine
is a competitive inhibitor and, thereby most likely binds to a site
different from the  xxxd3330xxx  site. on the other hand,  xxxd2419xxx  is
also a non-competitive inhibitor of  xxxg2099xxx  transport, and its
binding site was considered to overlap with that of  xxxd3330xxx . the
results described here suggest that although the  xxxd2419xxx 
and  xxxd3330xxx  binding sites may overlap they do not necessarily
share identical determinants.
efforts to determine directly the affinity of  xxxd3330xxx  to the
mutant protein were carried out to no avail. even at very high
protein concentration, the binding was too low to allow accurate measurement of the kd. on the other hand, [3h]serotonin
transport assayed in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the
f136l mutant revealed transport activity with a km to serotonin lower than that of the wild-type protein. thus the km was
28 ⫾ 7 nm (table 1) and a vmax somewhat lower than of the
wild-type protein (table 1).
to further characterize the properties of the f136l mutant
protein, we measured [3h]serotonin transport in the presence
of different concentrations of substrates and inhibitors and
used this dose-response analysis to estimate their apparent
affinity (fig. 5). whereas f136l was about 30-fold less sensitive
toward  xxxd3330xxx  when compared with wild type (fig. 5a, 2.4 ⫾ 1
and 0.08 ⫾ 0.005 ␮m, respectively), no major difference in ic50
was measured in response to mpp⫹ (fig. 5c), histamine (fig.
5d), and reserpine (not shown). these findings reinforce the

figure 5. the f136l mutation modifies the pharmacological profile of
rvmat2. liposomes (1.5 ␮l) reconstituted with rvmat2 (squares) or f136l
(triangles) were assayed for serotonin transport as described under “experimental procedures.” the reaction was terminated by filtration, and the bound
radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. [3h]serotonin transport
was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd3330xxx  (a), acriflavine (b), mpp⫹ (c), and histamine (d) to determine the concentration required
to inhibit transport by 50% (ic50). ic50 were calculated with origin 8 software.

hypothesis that f136l mutation affects mainly the affinity
toward  xxxd3330xxx  and has not significantly impaired other functions
of the protein. moreover, the apparently higher affinities to
serotonin (table 1) and to acriflavine (fig. 5b) as measured in
vitro and the increased resistance conferred to cells expressing
the mutant f136l (fig. 4a) suggest an enhanced recognition of
some of the substrates by the f136l mutant. because of its
increased apparent affinity to acriflavine, the mutant protein
can remove the toxin to concentrations lower than that
achieved by wild-type rvmat2.
an aromatic residue at position 136 contributes to the sensitivity toward  xxxd3330xxx —to further characterize the role of amino
acids at position 136 in rvmat2, we applied site directed
mutagenesis and replaced phe-136 with various amino acids.
the mutants were tested for their ability to confer resistance
against mpp⫹ and acriflavine and their sensitivity toward  xxxd3330xxx 
and reserpine. similar results were obtained with both toxins,

substitution to lys, glu, and trp impaired the ability of
vmat2 to confer resistance against the toxins. whereas the
effect of lys and trp substitutions resulted in full loss of activity, a glu replacement showed some marginal resistance. proteins with the aromatic amino acids phe (in rvmat2 wild type)
and tyr but not with the larger trp at position 136, displayed
full activity and exhibited similar susceptibility against  xxxd3330xxx .
mutant proteins with the hydrophobic amino acids ile, met,
val, and leu at the same position exhibited essentially the same
levels of activity but low sensitivity toward the inhibitor.

residues phe and tyr at position 136 may contribute to
rvmat2 sensitivity toward the inhibitor  xxxd3330xxx , and is most
likely needed for an efficient binding of the inhibitor to the
protein. the bulkier trp has a deleterious effect on activity.
type ii mutants result from mutations in tm11—in addition to the f136l mutant, two other mutants were isolated and
further characterized. these mutants, i425f and v428a, displayed a phenotype different from the f136l even though they
were isolated using the same strategy. their growth on acriflavine in the presence of  xxxd3330xxx  was substantial (fig. 7c) but not as
robust as the one displayed by f136l-rvmat2. in addition,
unlike f136l, growth was detectable also in the presence of
reserpine (fig. 7d). whereas growth of rvmat2-f136l cells
was 50 times less sensitive toward  xxxd3330xxx , the difference in ic50
values for i425f and v428a mutants was only about 1.3- and
3.2-fold, respectively (table 1).
notably, moreover, membranes prepared from cells expressing these two mutants bound [3h]tbzoh with an affinity only
2–3-fold lower than rvmat2 (table 1). because it was surprising that such small differences would be sufficient for selection of these cells under the relatively stringent conditions
used, we further investigated the phenotype. remarkably,
both mutants provided a more robust resistance to acriflavine than rvmat2: as shown in fig. 7e, growth of both
mutants was evident even at concentrations as high as 200
␮m acriflavine, a concentration well above that permissible
for rvmat2 cells. we suggest, therefore, that the reason
that these mutants were selectable under the same stringent
conditions used for isolation of f136l is due to a combination of two properties: superior growth on acriflavine and a
small difference in the affinity to  xxxd3330xxx .

above the value of 180 nm for rvmat2 (table 1).
to further characterize the role of amino acids at positions
425 and 428 in rvmat2, we applied site-directed mutagenesis
and replaced ile-425 and val-428 with various amino acids. the
mutants were tested for their ability to confer resistance against
mpp⫹ and acriflavine. substitution of val-428 to lys or asp
impaired the ability of vmat2 to confer resistance against the
toxins. mutant proteins with the hydrophobic amino acids met
(obtained also in the selection) and leu at the same position
conferred essentially the same levels of resistance as the v428a
mutant and a mutant with phe conferred slightly decreased
resistance, essentially as wild-type rvmat2. none of the replacements at position 425 conferred the robust resistance displayed by the phe mutant. however, ala, leu, met, and trp
supported the same level of resistance as rvmat2, and tyr
generated a mutant with impaired function as judged by this
assay (data not shown).
rvmat2 with three mutations lost the ability to transport
neurotransmitter but confers robust resistance to a variety of
toxic compounds—a mutant rvmat2 bearing the three
mutations f136l, i425f, and v428a (rvmat2-triple) was constructed and characterized. rvmat2-triple conferred a considerably improved resistance to acriflavine (fig. 8a) and to
mpp⫹ (not shown) compared with wild type or to any of the
single mutants (compare figs. 8a and 7e). moreover, it seems
to have acquired novel specificities because it conferred a significant resistance to ethidium (fig. 8c) and a marginal but
noticeable resistance to acridine orange (fig. 8b).

the mechanism of inhibition of
transport by  xxxd3330xxx  has been the subject of a large number of studies.
 xxxd3330xxx  is a potent non-competitive
inhibitor of  xxxg2099xxx -mediated transport (13). it also inhibits substrate
binding with a similar ki. on the
other hand, substrates inhibit  xxxd3330xxx 
binding only at concentrations at
least hundred times higher than
their affinities (13, 30). a corollary
of this finding is that both sites (substrate and  xxxd3330xxx ) can be occupied at
the same time, provided the substrate binds first. we speculate that
occupancy of the  xxxd3330xxx  binding site
prevents access to the substrate,
probably by the formation of a steric
barrier similar to what was suggested for the mode of inhibition of
an antidepressant in the bacterial
leut transporter (31, 32).
the fact that phe-136, ile-425,
and val-428 are conserved even in
homologues that do not bind  xxxd3330xxx 
stresses the power of the approach
described here that allows for an
unbiased search of residues involved in one or other aspect of the
catalytic cycle. native vesicular
