summary: in a therapeutic trial, the effect of short-term low-dosage nacetylcysteine supplementation on glutathione metabolism was investigated in
two patients with hereditary" glutathione deficiency (5-oxoprolinuria). clinical
and neurophysiological examinations of the patients indicated progressive
neurological damage.
the pretreatment concentrations of total and free glutathione in leukocytes
were 15-20% of normal, whereas the corresponding y-glutamylcysteine levels
were increased. in plasma, the glutathione concentrations were similarly
decreased, bur no y-glutamylcysteine was detected. total glutathione in
erythrocytes was markedly decreased. low urinary excretion of cysteinylglycine, cyst(e)ine, taurine,  xxxd68xxx , mercaptolactate and mercaptoacetate and reduced leukocyte taurine levels constituted additional evidence of
decreased intracellular availability of cysteine, i.e. glutathione.
oral supplementation with  xxxd68xxx  (5mg/kg x 3/day) had no
effect on acid-base balance, erythrocyte glutathione levels or  xxxd3052xxx 
concentrations in plasma and urine. in leukocytes, the glutathione concentrations were increased by 20-30%, whereas the y-glutamylcysteine levels
were essentially unaltered. in parallel, the urinary excretion of cysteinylglycine was increased and the leukocyte levels and urinary outputs of sulphur
amino acids were restored. no side-effects of the treatment were noted. the
results indicate that  xxxd68xxx  may be of value in increasing the low
intracellular glutathione concentrations and cysteine availability in patients
with hereditary  xxxg982xxx  deficiency.

therapeutic trial with  xxxd68xxx 

121

introduction
in patients with hereditary  xxxg982xxx  deficiency (mckusick 26613),
markedly decreased intracellular concentrations of glutathione are found, reaching
only 10-20% of the normal levels (wellner et al., 1974; larsson and hagenfeldt,
1983). as a result, chronic metabolic acidosis, an increased rate of haemolysis,
neurological disorders and defective granulocyte function can occur (cf. meister
and larsson, 1989). the acidosis, which is due to the accumulation of  xxxd3052xxx ,
can be controlled with bicarbonate supplementation. the increased rate of haemolysis is partially compensated by an increased production of red blood cells.
 xxxd3521xxx  treatment has been shown to improve both erythrocyte survival (spielberg et al., 1979) and granulocyte function (boxer et al., 1979). in contrast, the
neurological symptoms observed have not responded to any treatment as yet, but
are slowly progressive (larsson et ai., 1985). therapeutic approaches in patients
with  xxxg982xxx  deficiency tried previously, in addition to correction of
the acidosis, have included supplementation with glutathione, 2-mercaptopropionylgtycine (larsson et al., 1985) and  xxxd3521xxx  (spielberg et al., 1977; boxer et al.,
1979). these trials have not been successful in increasing intracellular glutathione
levels (larsson et al., 1985). cystamine treatment has been suggested (griffith et
al., 1977) but this entails a potential risk of further deteriorating the clinical
condition of the patients, since the compound inhibits y-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting and unaffected enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione in these
patients.
 xxxd68xxx  is used in treatment of patients with paracetamol intoxication.
the mechanism is to increase cysteine availability for glutathione synthesis in the
liver. this will enhance the capacity to detoxify the highly reactive compounds
generated from massive paracetamol overdosage and prevent the liver damage and
fatal outcome in the patient: this study presents evidence of a stimulative effect of
oral  xxxd68xxx  supplementation in increasing the low reduced levels of
glutathione found in leukocytes in two sisters with hereditalt  xxxg982xxx 
deficiency.

case report

two sisters with hereditary glutathione synthethase deficiency, j.g. and h.g.,
born in 1970 and 1973 respectively, were studied. the clinical course of the patients
up to the age of 12 (j.g.) and 9 years (h.g.) have been described previously
(larsson et al., 1985). before school age, the mental development of both girls
appeared normal. the older sister (j.g.) decreased in her developmental quotient
from 115 (buhler-hetzer) at one year of age to 70 (wisc) at the age of 12 (larsson
et al., 1985), and had to be given extra assistance to follow the normal teaching.
the younger sister decreased from about 100 (griffiths) at one year of age to 83
(wisc) at the age of nine years.
although treatment with  xxxd3521xxx  had no effect on the acid-base balance,
electroretinograms (ergs), glutathione levels or  xxxd3052xxx  excretion (larsson
j. inher. metab. dis. 12 (1989)

122

m d r t e n s s o n et al.

et al., 1985), the patients had still been kept on a daily dose of 600mg of the

compound ( xxxd3389xxx  ®, roche) since the age of 12 (j.g.) and nine years (h.g.).
at the time of the present-admission, the two patients were 13 and 15 years old,
respectively. the haemoglobin and serum haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase,
 xxxg941xxx , y-glutamyltransferase, creatinine and electrolytes were
normal in both girls. the acid-base balance was similar to that previously reported,
with base excess values of -2.6mmol/l ( j . g . ) a n d -4.3mmol/l (h.g.) on
admission. cerebrospinal fluid protein levels were normal and no erythrocytes,
leukocytes or iron-laden macrophages were found. neuro!ogi~al examination revealed slight clinical abnormalities in gross motor development. on formal psychological testing with wisc, j.g. was found to have a developmental quotient of
about 90, and h.g. about 70. the older sister (j.g.) thus had an improved result
compared with the test performed three years earlier, whereas the younger sister
had continued to decline. the improvement in the developmental quotient of the
older sister was related to the verbal part of the test.
as previously (larsson et al., 1985), electroretinograms were abnormal in both
patients, whereas electroencephalograms, sensory evoked potentials and motor
nerve conduction velocities were essentially normal. in the case of visual evoked
cortical potentials (vecps), both girls had abnormally shaped response curves.
complex reaction time testing (gillberg, 1987) revealed slow responses in both
girls, indicating immaturity in the central nervous system.
the patients underwent nuclear magnetic resonance tomography of the brain.
in the older girl (j.g.), an area of increased signal intensity (possible oedema) was
noted between the grey and white matter in the middle part of the cerebellum. in
the younger sister, no pathological changes were found.
before the therapeutic trial, the girls were hospitalized for 2 days to establish a
regular food intake pattern; the pretreatment values refer to this period. the daily
protein and caloric intakes were 2.6 g and 0.25 mj per kg :respectively. both girls
received  xxxd68xxx  ( xxxd68xxx  ®, tika, sweden) orally 200mg three times
daily for 6 days. the medication with  xxxd3521xxx , 600 mg daily, and sodium bicarbonate, 4g daily, was continued during the trial.
glutathione levels were determined on blood samples taken at 9 a.m. after an
overnight fast to avoid the known circadian variation in free intracellular glutathione
levels (tateishi et al., 1974), before the morning dose of  xxxd68xxx . urine
samples (24 h) were collected with thymot isopropanol as preservative. all (blood
and urine) samples were analysed in duplicate; that is before, on the second and
fourth (only urine), and 6th days of treatment. the results were compared with
corresponding data from healthy age-matched pair-fed subjects (mgtrtensson et al.,
1985a) and adults on an ordinary well-balanced diet (mgtrtensson, 1986, 1987).
informed consent wag obtained from the parents before the study began. the
protocol was approved by the ethics committee of uppsala university.

metabolites (mfirtensson, 1982, msrtensson et al., 1985b).  xxxd3052xxx  was determined in plasma and urine (hagenfeldt et al., 1974). the total glutathione concentrations in erythrocytes~was measured as described (larsson et al., 1976). the
preparation and determination of free and total glutathione and y-glutamylcysteine
levels (m~rtensson, 1986, 1987) in leukocytes and plasma were determined by
established procedures. the free reduced  xxxd68xxx  concentration in plasma
(k~gedal et al., 1984) and cysteinylglycine in urine (k~gedal and kfillberg, 1984)
were assayed as reported.
results
the  xxxd68xxx  supplementation did not result in any adverse clinical effects
and the acid-base balance was not altered.
the low erythrocyte glutathione levels and high plasma level and urinary output
of  xxxd3052xxx  previously reported (larsson et al., 1974) were not markedly

increased by the treatment with  xxxd68xxx  (table 1). hypothetically, an
increased availability of cysteine could increase intracellular y-glutamylcysteine
levels, which, as a result of the enzymatic defect, may result in an increased
formation of  xxxd3052xxx .
pretreatment concentrations of total and  xxxd2213xxx  in leukocytes were
decreased to 15-20% of the normal concentrations in both sisters (table 2). in
contrast, increased leukocyte concentrations of reduced and total y-glutamylcysteine were found. during  xxxd68xxx  supplementation, both reduced and total
glutathione concentrations increased by 20-30%, whereas the y-glutamylcysteine
concentrations were essentially unaltered. before treatment, the plasma glutathione concentrations were low, as in leukocytes, but the free reduced fraction was
less dominating. during supplementation, the plasma glutathione concentrations
tended to increase. before treatment, plasma y-glutamylcysteine was undetectable

the pretreatment leukocyte and plasma concentrations and urinary outputs of
methionine and cystathionine were normal (table 3). the corresponding taurine,
cyst(e)ine and cyst(e)inylglycine concentrations were all decreased. supplementation with  xxxd68xxx  resulted in increased leukocyte and plasma concentrations and urinary output of taurine, whereas the cyst(e)ine levels in plasma and
urine were restored to normal. the cyst(e)inylglycine excretion increased during
 xxxd68xxx  treatment, but was not completely restored.
pretreatment urinary excretion of total sulphur, inorganic sulphate and thiosulphate were normal and they all increased during treatment (table 4). the pretreatment excretion of mercaptolactate, mercaptoacetate and  xxxd68xxx  were all
low-normal. the excretions of these compounds were all restored to normal during
 xxxd68xxx  treatment. the fasting plasma  xxxd68xxx  concentration was
undetectable (<0.1 ~mol/l) in the younger sister (h.g.), whereas the older sister
(j.g.) had a low-normal plasma concentration of this compound. the fasting peak
plasma concentration of  xxxd68xxx , taken 40 minutes after an oral intake of
the compound (kgtgedal et al., 1984), was subnormal in both sisters (table 4). it
should be noted that the total amount of  xxxd68xxx  given in each dosage,
200mg (4.5mg?kg body weight), was somewhat lower than the amounts given
(5.5 mg/kg b.w.) to the adult reference group (kgtgedal et al., 1984).

discussion

progressive neurological damage is over-represented among patients with  xxxg982xxx  deficiency (meister and larsson, 1989). the two patients described here have so far had relatively mild symptoms. nevertheless, there are

clear indications of neurological damage in the two girls as judged from their
pathological electroretinograms and visual evoked cortical potentials and from the
results of formal psychometric tests. in addition, magnetic resonance tomography
of the brain indicated localized cerebellar oedema in one of the girls.
interestingly, leukocyte gtutathione concentrations were somewhat higher (1520% of normal) than those in erythrocytes (5-10% of normal) (wellner et at., 1974;
larsson and hagenfeldt, 1983). in parallel, increased leukocyte yrglutamylcysteine
levels were found, in support of previous observations in in vitro studies of
fibroblasts from these patients (larsson et al., 1983). the total concentration of yglutamylcysteine was, however, only 1% of the normal total glutathione level.
thus, although y-glutamytcysteine may replace some metabolic functions of glutathione (larsson et al., 1983, 1985; m~rtensson et al., 1985a), the concentrations
are too low to be as effective as glutathione in protection against oxidative damage
(larsson and hagenfeldt, 1983; boxer et al., 1979; meister and anderson, 1983).
this hypothesis is supported by the observation that patients lacking y-glutamylcysteine synthetase display more pronounced clinical symptoms than our patients
(richards et al., 1974), including neurological damage and myopathy. these
patients do not synthesize glutathione or y-glutamylcysteine in sufficient amounts.
in contrast to the stimulative effect of  xxxd68xxx  on leukocyte glutathione
levels, erythrocyte glutathione concentration was not affected. this may relate to
the marked differences in their glutathione turnover; the half-life of glutathione in
leukocytes is about 300-fold shorter (unpublished data) than that in erythrocytes
in vivo (kosower and kosower, 1978; griffith 1981). if the residual activities of
 xxxg982xxx  are higher in leukocytes than in erythrocytes in our patients
(which was not confirmed), this effect could also have contributed. furthermore,
the interorgan priority system for glutathione transport is not yet fully worked out,
although the high 7-glutamyltranspeptidase activities found in leukocytes ensures
efficient recycling of glutathione in these cells (meister and anderson, 1983).
erythrocytes are essentially devoid of this enzyme.
only limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics and biological availability of  xxxd68xxx  (k~gedal et at., 1984; maddock, 1980). the
low-normal plasma peak  xxxd68xxx  concentrations observed after oral intake
of the compound (k~gedal et al., 1984) favoui:ed rapid utilization in the body, an
opinion which was strengthened by the small amounts (1% of the intake) of nacetylcysteine excreted in the patients' urine.
cysteinylglycine is formed from glutathione, predominantly in the kidney, by
the action of y-glutamyltranspeptidase and the amounts excreted in the urine seem
mainly to reflect ~the intracellular levels of glutathione (m~rtensson et al., 1985a;
meister and anderson, 1983). a reduced output of cysteinylglycine has previously
been reported in these patients. during  xxxd68xxx  treatment, an increased
cysteinylglycine output was observed, supporting the stimulative effect of nacetylcysteine on glutathione synthesis.
taurine synthesis in man is primarily regulated by the intracellular availability
of sulphur amino acids, i.e. cysteine (sturman and hayes, 1980). the low leukocyte
levels of taurine found in our patients may thus support a general shortage of
j. inher. metab. dis. 12 (1989)

128

m d r t e n s s o n et ai.

cysteine in the body. this concept is not unlikely, since glutathione has been shown
to serve as an intracellular reservoir of cysteine (tateishi et al., 1974), whereas the
intracellular level of cysteine itself is normally low and tightly regulated. during
supplementation with  xxxd68xxx , leukocyte and plasma levels of taurine
rapidly increased, supporting the primary regulatory function of cysteine in taurine
synthesis.
during  xxxd68xxx  supplementation, increased excretion of inorganic sulphate and thiosi~lphate were observed. the increased excretion of inorganic sulphate merely reflects the increased intake (mgtrtensson, 1982) of cysteine, i.e. nacetylcysteine. factors regulating thiosulphate production are less well characterized, although the sulphur amino acid intake (mgtrtensson, 1982) and bacterial flora
of the gut, i.e. anaerobes, are involved (mgtrtensson et al., 1984, msrtensson et al.,
1985b). during  xxxd68xxx  treatment, a significant portion of the compound
is probably deacetylated already in the gut, and increased amounts of cyst(e)ine
are then presented to the bacterial flora. our results thus support the involvement
of the gut flora in thiosulphate synthesis.
the present biochemical findings of increase in leukocyte  xxxd2213xxx 
concentration during short-term  xxxd68xxx  supplementation are encouraging
and the long-term effects of treatment with  xxxd68xxx  or alternative cysteine
or glutathione sources (meister and anderson, 1983; anderson et al., 1985) on the
biochemical and clinical course of these patients should be evaluated. this is
especially important in light of the progressive nature of the neurological defects
in the disease (meister and larsson, 1989). furthermore, in an earlier study using
2-mercaptopropionylglycine in these patients (larsson et al., 1985), only a shortterm stimulative effect on glutathione synthesis was found. if  xxxd68xxx 
treatment is to be further tested, a more substantial dosage of the compound should
probably be given. however, higher doses of  xxxd68xxx  may be toxic with
the potential risk of accumulating intracellular cyst(e)ine (arrick et al., 1985) and
 xxxd3052xxx  (wellner et al., 1974; larsson and hagenfeldt, 1983; meister and
anderson, 1983). patients given higher doses of  xxxd68xxx  must therefore
be carefully monitored by following the concentrations of glutathione,  xxxd3052xxx 
and cyst(e)ine in the body. the possibility of accumulation of potentially toxic
metabolites of cysteine, such as mercaptoacetate (bauche et al., 1983), sulphite
and hydrogen sulphide, must also be considered.

points in readers' letters
concerning j. inher. metab. dis. 11 (1988) 299-301 antoshechkin etal., prof. u- langenbeck
(frankfurt, frg) has pointed out that the method used (anal. biochem. 169, 33-40) for
measuring  xxxd2922xxx  may be operating on the normal cell line samples at or below
its sensitivity limits which were not stated in the paper.

prof. a. g. antoshechkin replies that the minimum concentration of  xxxd2922xxx 
which the mass spectrometer used could measure was about 0.80-0.1~tg/ml. this group
detected no  xxxd2922xxx  or other metabolites characteristic of pku in any of the
cultures of skin fibroblasts from 6 different individuals who were not pku patients.
