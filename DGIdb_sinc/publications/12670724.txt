analysis of genetic polymorphisms of steroid 5alpha-reductase type 1 and 2 genes in korean men with androgenetic alopecia.  genetic polymorphisms of steroid 5alpha-reductase have been studied in androgenetic alopecia in caucasians, but the genes encoding the two isoenzymes were not associated with male pattern baldness. genetic polymorphisms and ethnic variations have not been studied for asians, although it is suggested that racial difference could exist and influence clinical phenotypes.
