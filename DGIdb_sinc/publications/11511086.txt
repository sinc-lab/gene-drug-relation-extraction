the antipsychotic drugs  xxxd3195xxx  and  xxxd2956xxx  block  xxxg1248xxx , a human brain k(+) channel.  the antipsychotic drugs  xxxd3195xxx  and  xxxd2956xxx  are known to prolong the qt interval on the electrocardiogram via a high affinity block of the cardiac k(+) channel known as herg (human ether-a-go-go-related gene;  xxxg1246xxx ). we wished to test whether these drugs also displayed high affinity for the related neuronal k(+) channel  xxxg1248xxx . the cdna encoding  xxxg1248xxx  channel was cloned from a human brain library. northern analysis confirmed that the channel was localized to brain relative to other tissues including heart, liver and lung. within the brain,  xxxg1248xxx  was expressed in higher amounts in the frontal lobe and cerebellum relative to the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. transient expression of  xxxg1248xxx  in chinese hamster ovary cells produced outwardly directed k(+) currents that activated at approximately -50 mv and produced a large transient component at positive membrane potentials. inward tail currents measured at -100 mv were blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by  xxxd3195xxx  resulting in an ic(50) value of 43 nm. significant inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 3 nm. block of  xxxg1248xxx  by  xxxd3195xxx  also displayed a positive voltage-dependence.  xxxd2956xxx  blocked  xxxg1248xxx  channel currents with an ic(50) of 103 nm and significant inhibition was noted at concentrations of 10 nm and higher. we conclude that  xxxg1248xxx  can be blocked by certain antipsychotic drugs like  xxxd3195xxx  and  xxxd2956xxx . inhibition of  xxxg1248xxx  or related k(+) channels in the brain may contribute to the efficacy/side effect profiles of some antipsychotic drugs.
