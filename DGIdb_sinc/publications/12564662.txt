summary

we have evaluated the biochemical selectivity of
novel cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors,
 xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd3481xxx , dfu and dfp, vs
rofecoxib and celecoxib, using the human whole
blood assays of cox-isozyme activity, in vitro.
compounds were incubated with human whole
blood samples, allowed to clot for 1 h at 37°c,
or stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (10 µg/ml)
for 24 h at 37°c. serum thromboxane (tx) b2
and plasma prostaglandin (pg) e2 levels were
measured by specific radioimmunoassays as
indices of platelet cox-1 and monocyte cox-2
activity, respectively.  xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2069xxx , dfu

introduction
prostanoids are formed by three coordinated
enzymatic reactions: (1) the hydrolysis of arachidonic
acid (aa) from the sn-2 position of membrane
glycerophospholipids by ubiquitous  xxxg1759xxx 
enzymes1; (2) the conversion of free aa to
prostaglandin (pg) g2 and then to pgh2 by the two
isoforms of pgh-synthase (referred to as  xxxg1883xxx 
and  xxxg1884xxx  or cox-1 and cox-2), endowed with
cyclo-oxygenase (cox) and peroxidase activities2,3;
and (3) the conversion of pgh2 to different
prostanoids by cell-specific synthases4,5.

and dfp inhibited platelet cox-1 and monocyte
cox-2 with the following cox-1/cox-2 ic50
ratios: 61.5, 344, 660 and 1918, respectively.
the reference compounds, celecoxib and
rofecoxib had corresponding values of 29.6 and
272. in conclusion, a second wave of cox-2
inhibitors with higher biochemical selectivity
than the existing coxibs has been developed.
whether their administration will be associated
with improved clinical efficacy and/or safety visà-vis celecoxib and rofecoxib remains to be
established.

the discovery of cox-26,7 has provided the
rationale for the development of a new class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids),
denominated coxibs, with the aim of reducing the
gastrointestinal (gi) toxicity associated with the
administration of non-selective nsaids, by virtue of
cox-1 sparing (reviewed by fitzgerald and patrono,
20018). two coxibs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, have
been approved by fda and emea for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and osteoarthritis (oa).
both compounds have been shown to be comparable
in clinical efficacy to traditional nsaids in patients

with oa of the hip and knee, as well as in ra8. two
large randomised, double-blind gi outcome studies
have been performed to assess the risk of clinically
important upper gi (ugi) events associated with
rofecoxib and celecoxib vs non-selective nsaids:
the vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research
(vigor) study9 and the celecoxib long-term
arthritis safety study (class)10, respectively. the
incidence of gi perforation, gi haemorrhage, or
symptomatic peptic ulcer was significantly
( p < 0.001) lower in patients with ra treated with
rofecoxib vs naproxen9 consistent with the cox-2
selectivity of the former, even at high doses11. in
contrast, there was no statistically significant
( p = 0.09) difference between celecoxib and
diclofenac and ibuprofen in the incidence of
perforations, obstructions and bleeds (pobs) (the
prespecified primary end-point in class)10, possibly
as a consequence of inadequate biochemical
selectivity of celecoxib at high doses12.
screening and structure–activity relationship
studies have been performed in order to identify
novel selective cox-2 inhibitors, such as 4-(5methyl-3-phenylisoxazol-4-yl)-benzensulfonamide
( xxxd3481xxx )13, 5-chloro-2-(6-methylpyridin-3-yl)-3(4-methylsulphonylphenyl) pyridine ( xxxd2069xxx )14,
5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4methylsulphonyl)phenyl-2(5h)-furanone (dfu)15
and 3-(2-propyloxy)-(4-methylsulphonylphenyl)(5,5-dimethyl)-furanone (dfp)16.  xxxd2069xxx  and
 xxxd3481xxx  have been approved recently in some
countries. on the other hand, dfu and dfp are
primarily chemical prototypes for the development
of highly selective cox-2 inhibitors.
 xxxd2069xxx  has been reported to be as effective as
rofecoxib and indomethacin in different
experimental animal models of acute inflammation,
i.e. carrageenan-induced paw oedema, carrageenaninduced paw hyperalgesia, and endotoxin-induced
pyresis in rats14. in the same experimental models,
 xxxd3481xxx , dfu and dfp showed a better efficacy
as compared with indomethacin13,15,16. furthermore,
 xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd3481xxx , dfu and dfp have been
reported to be effective in experimental models of
chronic inflammation, such as adjuvant-induced
arthritis13–16.
the aim of our study was to compare the cox1/cox-2 selectivity of the new cox-2 inhibitors
 xxxd2069xxx ,  xxxd3481xxx , dfu and dfp with that of
rofecoxib and celecoxib using the well-established
human whole blood assays of cox-isozyme activity,
in vitro17.

materials and methods
subjects
nineteen healthy volunteers (eight females and 11
males, aged 29.4 ± 9 years) were enrolled to
participate in the study after its approval by the
ethical committee of the university of chieti.
informed consent was obtained from each subject.
the same healthy volunteers were studied on
different occasions.

cox-2 assay
one-ml aliquots of peripheral venous blood samples
containing 10 i.u. of sodium heparin were incubated
in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (lps, 10
µg/ml) or saline for 24 h at 37°c as previously
described17. the contribution of platelet cox-1 was
suppressed by pretreating the subjects with aspirin
300 mg 48 h before sampling18. plasma was separated
by centrifugation (10 min at 2000 rev/min) and kept
at –80°c until assayed for pge2, as an index of lpsinduced monocyte cox-2 activity.

cox-1 assay
peripheral venous blood samples were drawn from
the same donors when they had not taken any
nsaid during the 2 weeks preceding the study.
one-ml aliquots of whole blood were immediately
transferred into glass tubes and allowed to clot at
37°c for 1 h. serum was separated by centrifugation
(10 min at 3000 rev/min) and kept at –80°c until
assayed for txb2. whole blood txb2 production was
measured as a reflection of maximally stimulated
platelet cox-1 activity in response to endogenously
formed thrombin19.

effects of cox-2 inhibitors on whole
blood cox-2 and cox-1 activities
rofecoxib
(0.0025–200 mm),
celecoxib
(0.005–50 mm),  xxxd3481xxx  (0.0005–50 mm),
 xxxd2069xxx 
(0.0005–150
mm),
dfu
(0.005–250 mm) and dfp (0.005–250 mm) were
dissolved in dmso, and 2-µl aliquots of the solutions
were pipetted directly into test tubes to give final
concentrations of 0.001–500 µm in blood. six to ten
different concentrations of each compound were
incubated with heparinised whole blood samples in
the presence of lps (10 µg/ml) for 24 h or with
whole blood samples allowed to clot at 37°c for 1 h,
in order to examine the concentration-dependence of
cox-2 vs cox-1 inhibition, respectively. the actual
concentrations of the compounds used for each assay
are reported in the legends to figures.

analyses of pge2 and txb2
pge2 and txb2 concentrations were measured by
previously
described
and
validated
18,20
radioimmunoassays . unextracted plasma and
serum samples were diluted in the standard diluent
of the assay (0.02 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) and
assayed in a volume of 1.5 ml at a final dilution of
1 : 50–1 : 30 000. we used 4000 d.p.m. of [3h]pge2
or [3h]txb2 and specific anti-pge2 and anti-txb2
sera diluted 1 : 100 000 and 1 : 120 000, respectively.
the least detectable concentration was 1–2 pg/ml for
both prostanoids.

materials
[3h]pge2 and [3h]txb2 (specific activity
> 100 ci/mmol) were from perkin elmer life
science products (brussels, belgium). authentic
pge2 and txb2 were from cayman chemical
company (ann arbor, mich, usa). anti-pge2 and
anti-txb2 sera were obtained in our laboratory and
their characteristics have been described
previously18,20. heparin, lps derived from escherichia
coli 026:b6 and dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) were
purchased from sigma chemical company (st.
louis, mo, usa). rofecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx ,  xxxd2069xxx ,
dfu and dfp were provided by merck & co., inc.
celecoxib was obtained from searle.

statistical analysis
for each experiment, the amount of pge2 produced
in lps-stimulated whole blood in the presence of an
inhibitor was subtracted from that produced in the
presence of saline and dmso. the effects of the test
compounds were calculated and represented as per
cent inhibition of prostanoid production assessed in
the absence of the test compounds (control).
concentration–response curves were fitted, and ic50
values were analysed with prism (graphpad, san
diego, ca, usa) and allfit, a basic computer
program for simultaneous curve-fitting based on a

four-parameter logistic equation21. the data are
expressed as means ± sem. cox-1/cox-2
selectivity was expressed as the ratio of the
corresponding ic50 values with 95% confidence
intervals. statistical comparisons were made by
student’s t-test. a p value < 0.05 was considered
significant.

results
lps-stimulated whole blood samples, drawn from
healthy subjects treated with aspirin 300 mg 48 h
before sampling, produced 27.2 ± 3 ng of pge2 per
ml of plasma (mean ± sem, n = 30). txb2
production in whole blood samples, obtained from
the same subjects in aspirin-free periods, averaged
399 ± 30 ng/ml (mean ± sem, n = 26).
as shown in figures 1, 2 and 3, rofecoxib,
 xxxd2069xxx , celecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx , dfu and dfp
inhibited lps-induced monocyte cox-2 and
thrombin-stimulated platelet cox-1 activities in a
concentration-dependent fashion. the ic50 values for
inhibition of platelet cox-1 and monocyte cox-2
and the derived cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratios are
detailed in table 1.
celecoxib and rofecoxib showed a cox-1/cox-2
ic50 ratio of 29.60 ± 4.50 and 272 ± 35 (mean ±
sem), respectively ( p < 0.01). the corresponding
values for  xxxd2069xxx , dfu and dfp ranged between
344 and 1918. the analysis of the sigmoidal
concentration–response curves for inhibition of
cox-2 and cox-1 by  xxxd2069xxx , dfu and dfp
showed that virtually complete suppression (> 90%)
of monocyte cox-2 activity occurred at
concentrations that did not affect platelet cox-1
activity, to any statistically significant extent (figures
1 and 3). similar results were obtained with
rofecoxib (figure 1).

also incubated with 1 ml whole blood samples (drawn from healthy subjects when they had not taken any nsaid

oa24, celecoxib and rofecoxib, are diarylheterocyclic
derivatives. structure–activity studies indicated that
a cis-stilbene moiety containing a 4-methylsulfonyl or
sulfonamide substituent in one of the pendant phenyl
rings was required for cox-2 selectivity2.
in the present study, we have found that rofecoxib
is at least two orders of magnitude more potent in
inhibiting monocyte cox-2 than platelet cox-1.
this finding is consistent with substantial sparing of
platelet and gastric mucosa cox-1 activity, as
assessed ex vivo and in vivo, respectively, at
therapeutic oral dosing25–27. the clinical read-outs of
such cox-2 selectivity of rofecoxib were comparable
to clinical efficacy of naproxen in the long-term
management of ra patients associated with halving of
clinical gi events in the vigor trial9.
in our whole blood assays, celecoxib showed a
cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratio of 30. not surprisingly,
such a limited cox-2 selectivity was associated with
large interindividual variability in the inhibition of
platelet cox-1 activity following single oral dosing
of celecoxib 100–800 mg in healthy subjects12.
inadequate biochemical selectivity of celecoxib at
800 mg daily may have contributed, at least in part,
to the failure of the class trial in reaching a
statistically significant difference in its primary endpoint between celecoxib and comparator nsaids, as
well as to the apparent heterogeneity of the results
obtained in separate comparisons of celecoxib to
ibuprofen vs celecoxib to diclofenac8.
in addition to a substantial interindividual
variability in drug plasma levels achieved after oral
dosing with a cox inhibitor, it has been shown that
the inhibition of platelet cox-1 and monocyte
cox-2 is highly variable among the treated subjects
in response to any given plasma level of the
inhibitor12,28. the development of novel cox-2
inhibitors with improved biochemical selectivity over
that of commercially available coxibs, may have two
distinct potential advantages. in principle, it should
lead to a clear-cut separation of cox-2- from cox1-dependent effects, by virtue of maximising the
likelihood of exposed patients being in the 80–100%
range of cox-2 inhibition and in the 0–20% range of
cox-1 inhibition throughout the dosing interval.
whether this will allow using higher coxib doses for
improved efficacy remains to be established, given
the dose-dependence of mechanism-based renal
effects associated with these agents29. secondly, it
could diminish the probability of the cox-2
inhibitor interfering with permanent inactivation of
platelet cox-1 by low-dose aspirin, in patients
requiring anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet
therapy30. recent studies suggest that the likelihood
of selective cox-2 inhibitors sharing this
pharmacodynamic interaction of conventional
nsaids is inversely related to their cox-2

however,
the
controversial
selectivity31.
cardiovascular findings of the vigor trial have led
to discussion of whether the vascular consequences
of endothelial cox-2 inhibition are modified by
unopposed platelet txa2 production8,32. at least
three possible explanations can be entertained in
accounting for the statistically significant difference
in mi rates between rofecoxib and naproxen (0.4 vs
0.1%, respectively), as reported by vigor trial9.
first, a cardioprotective effect of naproxen: but,
there is no convincing evidence that conventional
nsaids reduce the risk of mi33,34. second, a
thrombogenic effect of coxibs: but, the size of the
effect is not biologically plausible if it is due to
incomplete inhibition of a single mediator of
‘thromboresistance’, i.e. pgi212. moreover, such an
explanation is not substantiated by class results10,
though a smaller coxib effect cannot be excluded.
third, the play of chance: the apparent difference in
vigor might represent uneven distribution of a
small number of events occurring over a short time
frame in a low-risk population; a metanalysis of all
coxib trials might address this possibility8.
however, it should be mentioned that selective
cox-2 inhibition may have potential beneficial
effects in addition to low-dose aspirin in the setting
of acute coronary syndromes. thus, cox-2
expressed in inflammatory cells17,35,36 may account for
aspirin-resistant txa2 biosynthesis in acute coronary
syndromes37,38. baseline urinary excretion of 11dehydro-txb2 (a major enzymatic metabolite of
txa2) predicted the future risk of myocardial
infarction (mi) or cardiovascular death in a subgroup
of high-risk aspirin-treated patients participating in
the hope trial39.
using the whole blood assays, we have shown that
the new compounds,  xxxd2069xxx , dfu and dfp have
higher cox-1/cox-2 ic50 ratios (ranging from 344
to 1918) than rofecoxib (table 1).  xxxd2069xxx 
displays pharmacokinetic characteristics suitable to
its clinical use40 and has been recently approved in
the united kingdom. in healthy volunteers,
administration of single oral doses of the drug, up to
eight-fold greater than the clinically effective dose in
oa41, did not affect platelet cox-1 activity40,42. dfu
and dfp, the most selective cox-2 inhibitors in the
present study, have shown poor pharmacokinetic
characteristics in phase i clinical studies. in fact,
dfu was characterised by broad interindividual
variability of pharmacokinetic parameters, while
dfp showed a very extended half-life (t? = 64 h)43.
thus, although dfu and dfp may offer interesting
clues in the definition of structural requirements for
improved cox-2 selectivity, the inadequate
pharmacokinetic profile seems to limit their clinical
development.

and celecoxib that is fused to the stilbene framework
has led to the synthesis of  xxxd3481xxx , a
diarylisoxazole derivative which was recently
approved by the fda13. in the present study,
 xxxd3481xxx  resulted in 60-fold more potency towards
monocyte cox-2 than platelet cox-1.  xxxd3481xxx 
has been shown to be converted in vivo to an active
metabolite with higher cox-2 selectivity than the
parent compound13. however, this metabolite has
been detected in very low abundance in humans13. in
the whole blood assays,  xxxd3481xxx  showed a cox1/cox-2 ic50 ratio that was two-fold higher than
that of celecoxib. whether the increased cox-2
selectivity shown by  xxxd3481xxx  in vitro will translate
into an improved cox-1 sparing effect at
therapeutic plasma levels remains to be investigated.
in the last decade, the medical scientific
community has moved from the discovery of cox-2
to clinical trials demonstrating that rofecoxib, a
highly selective cox-2 inhibitor, causes similar
therapeutic effects but significantly fewer gi
complications than conventional nsaids.  xxxd2069xxx 
and  xxxd3481xxx  represent a second wave of cox-2
inhibitors with a slightly higher cox-1/cox-2
biochemical selectivity than rofecoxib and celecoxib,
respectively. whether their administration will be
associated with a detectably improved clinical
efficacy and/or safety vis-à-vis existing coxibs
remains to be established.
