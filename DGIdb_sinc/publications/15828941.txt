opioids are sometimes used to treat pain in ulcerative wounds, and it is speculated that pain interferes with the
healing process. because the direct effect of opioids on this process remains unknown, we examined the
effect of topically applied opioids on the healing of open ischemic wounds in rats. topically applied opioids
hastened wound closure, particularly in the first 4 days when no healing was initiated in phosphate buffered
saline solution-treated wounds. after 1 week of application, fentanyl, hydromorphone, and morphine resulted
in 66%, 55%, and 42% wound closure, respectively, as compared to only 15% in control wounds. opioidinduced healing was accompanied by a 1.5- to 2.5-fold increase in nuclear density in the granulation tissue
and 45–87% increase in angiogenesis as compared to phosphate buffered saline solution-treated wounds.
fentanyl showed significantly improved healing compared to morphine and hydromorphone (p < 0.05, fentanyl vs. others). fentanyl-induced healing was inhibited by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, suggesting
that peripheral opioid receptor(s) mediate the healing process. opioids accelerate healing by up-regulating
both endothelial and  xxxg1578xxx  and the vascular endothelial-derived growth factor
receptor  xxxg1274xxx  in the wounds. we envision that opioids can be used topically to accelerate wound healing in
diverse clinical conditions ranging from surgical incisions to nonhealing ischemic ulcers in pathophysiological
conditions and in hospice patients. (wound rep reg 2005;13:165–174)

wound healing is a complex, dynamic process in which
angiogenesis plays an integral role, but the exact
mechanisms regulating the healing process are not
well established. proposed therapies are promising
but there is no satisfactory therapy for problem
wound healing.1,2 however, it is known that the healing
process involves recruitment of inflammatory cells, cell
proliferation, and collagen formation in addition to
angiogenesis.3 these processes lead to remodeling of

healing is delayed in both inos and enos null

opioids, including morphine, stimulate no production in several neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.16–18 in
endothelium, morphine stimulates no via the m opioid
receptor and promotes vasodilation.19 endogenous
opioids regulate the inos expression in splenocytes in
vivo.20 we showed that morphine promotes endothelial
proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis by stimulating
nos-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) signaling, cell cycle progression, and akt phosphorylation.21 more recently, others showed similar
effects of opioids on decreasing apoptosis in lymphocytes and increasing proliferation of neural progenitors
and in embryonic cells in cardiogenesis.22–24 thus,
opioids are capable of promoting the growth of multiple
cell types and act like growth-promoting cytokines.
interestingly, m opioid receptor agonist analgesics
are sometimes used topically to treat pain in ulcerative
wounds,25–28 but whether they promote actual healing
of these wounds remains unknown. the no-mediated
signaling effects of morphine suggest that opioids may,
in fact, promote wound healing. in addition to nomediated signaling, opioids may also stimulate different
steps of the healing cascade by other mechanisms. notably, opioid receptors are activated and  xxxg1801xxx  is
secreted by cells at the site of injury.29
we hypothesized that topical application of opioids
at the site of injury stimulates cell proliferation and
angiogenesis, the two critical processes in the healing
cascade. we tested this hypothesis in rats using an
ischemic delayed open-wound healing model, which
closely mimics human ischemic wounds observed in
peripheral vascular disease.30

materials and methods
pharmacological grade morphine, fentanyl (baxter esilerderle mfd. healthcare corporation, cherry hill, nj),
and hydromorphone (elkins-sinn inc., cherry hill, nj)
were obtained from the boynton pharmacy at the
university of minnesota and blended with hydrocream
(paddock laboratories, minneapolis, mn) in our
laboratory. we applied opioids blended with hydrocream base (fentanyl, 5 mg/g, hydromorphone, 0.2 mg/
g, morphine, 1.5 mg/g, and 10 ml pbs/g for controls or as
indicated) topically on the wound area twice a day after
gently cleaning the wounds with sterile normal saline
using q-tips. opioid concentrations were selected
approximately on the basis of equi-analgesic doses of
morphine in the intrasité gel (10 mg/8 g) used topically
for analgesia on skin ulcers.31,32

animals and experimental protocol
nine-week-old normal fischer 344 rats weighing
approximately 250 g each were used (harlan sprague
dawley inc. indianapolis, in). rats were maintained
under controlled environmental conditions (12-hour
light to dark cycle, at 23 ˚c) in our aaalac accredited
facility and provided with standard laboratory food
and water ad libitum. all experiments were performed
following the iacuc approved protocols.
delayed excisional wound healing model
we used a highly reproducible model of ischemic
wounds without necrosis with increased sensitivity of
measurement of both excisional and incisional
wounds.30 briefly, we anesthetized rats by inhalation
of 2.6% isofluorane. a 7 · 2.5 cm rectangular template
was placed on the spine between the base of the scapulae and the iliac crest. the skin was marked using
two uniform holes arranged in a pair at 3.5 cm from the
end of the template and 3 mm from each edge. the
dorsal skin was folded to align the two circles opposite
each other, and a wooden dowel was placed against
one side of skin. a sterile 8-mm skin biopsy punch was
used to create a pair of full-thickness wounds centered
on the midline. two parallel 7-cm incisions expanding
through the panniculus carnosus were made along
the long side of the template. elevation of the skin
between the incisions by blunt dissection was used to
create an ischemic skin flap. incisions were closed with
autoclips.
wound observations
the scars were examined every day in situ, gross observations were recorded, and each wound was measured
on alternate days in two different ways either by tracing
twice onto transparencies or recording digital images
using a nikon coolpix 5700 digital camera. wound area
was calculated by using adobe photoshop and nih
image software. initial (day 1) wound area was used
as a baseline and for each time point, wound closure
was calculated.29,30 percentage of wound area covered
by new granulation tissue ¼ ([areai – arean]/areai) ·
100, where ai is the initial and an is the area at day ‘‘n.’’
animals from each group were euthanized by compressed co2 at the end point and wound scars collected
for analysis.
scar analysis
dissected scars were either frozen, fixed in 10% formalin,
or immediately homogenized and analyzed as follows.
histological evaluation
five-micron-thick sections of formalin fixed scars
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) and
evaluated for the following parameters: epidermal and

wound repair and regeneration

dermal regeneration, granulation tissue formation, presence or absence of edema, congestion, hemorrhage,
thrombosis, and intravascular or intervascular fibrin
formation. thickness of granulation tissue and epidermal regeneration were scored as described.33
immunofluorescent staining, collagen formation,
and microvessel density
five-micron-thick sections of frozen scars were immunostained with a-reca-1 (serotec ltd. oxford, uk)
specific for rat endothelial cells34 and rhodamine
red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary ab (jackson
immunoresearch laboratories inc., west grove, pa)
and counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(dapi; molecular probe, eugene, or) to detect total
nuclei. number of vessels, branching points, and total
length were quantitated using adobe photoshop and
reindeer graphics as described.21 the degree of collagen formation was evaluated by masson’s trichrome
staining.35 frozen sections of wound scars obtained on
day 8 were immunostained using anti- xxxg1274xxx  (santa cruz
biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca) and rhodamine red
conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary ab (jackson
immunoresearch laboratories inc). sections were costained with dapi for nuclear colocalization.
western blot analysis
scar lysates of wound tissue were prepared in lysis
buffer containing standard protease inhibitors.21 total
cell lysates containing 30 mg protein were resolved on
7.5% sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to pvdf membrane
(immobilon; millipore, bedford, ma). the membranes
were probed with anti-enos antibody (results shown
are with bd biosciences, san jose, ca; and from santa
cruz), or anti-inos antibody (results shown are from
bd transduction laboratories, san diego, ca, or santa
cruz), antiproliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna)
antibody (santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz,
ca) or anti-b-actin (santa cruz biotechnology inc.,
santa cruz, ca). the immunoreactive proteins were
visualized with the ecf western blotting system
using species-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (amersham life sciences, buckingamshire, united kingdom), and chemiluminescent
signals were acquired using a storm 860 phosphoimager (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca).
statistical analysis
analysis of repeated measurements using a generalized
linear mixed model was used to compare the effect of
different opioids over a period of 8 days (figure 1a).
kruskal-wallis tests were used to perform pairwise comparisons of the h&e scores between different treatments. analysis of variance (anova) was used for all

results
we blended morphine and fentanyl with a base hydrocream for topical application. each opioid preparation
was applied topically twice a day and we measured the
wounds periodically to determine whether opioids promoted the healing process. the initial day 1 wound area
was used as baseline, and for each time point, percent
wound area left unhealed and area healed were
calculated. fentanyl promoted healing of wounds
significantly as compared to control after 4 days of
treatment (p < 0.05; figure 1a). by day 8, fentanyl
showed about 66% healing compared to 55% for hydromorphone, 42% for morphine, and only 15% for controls. fentanyl was significantly more potent than
hydromorphone or morphine in wound healing
(p < 0.05 for fentanyl vs. morphine or hydromorphone
on day 8; and p < 0.05 for fentanyl vs. morphine on days
4 and 7). thus, topically applied opioids provide an
early acceleration to the healing of delayed wounds
and result in 30–50% improvement in wound closure
during the first week.
in comparative parallel experiments, we administered morphine (1 mg/kg/day) or pbs subcutaneously
twice a day via injection or continuously via subcutaneously implanted alzet osmotic pumps. the site of
subcutaneous delivery was about 2 cm distant from
the wound itself, but still within the relatively ischemic
flap. unlike direct topical application, subcutaneous
delivery failed to yield any significant effect of morphine either injected subcutaneously or administered
via alzet osmotic pumps as compared to pbs on wound
healing (figures 1b and c). presumably, subcutaneously
delivered opioids did not reach the wound because of
ischemia. moreover, in this model the blood supply to
the wound is restricted, which could also impair the
availability of injected opioids to the wounds. this
suggests that unlike the central regulation of analgesia
for pain, opioids exert a direct peripheral effect on
the healing process in the wounded skin.
we further observed that the wound healing
induced by opioids is dose dependent. fentanyl was
the most potent healer of the three opioids applied
topically. therefore, we used fentanyl to examine the
effect of dose on the healing process. on day 10, fentanyl 5 mg/g cream showed 100% healing, whereas 0.5 and
0.05 mg fentanyl/g cream led to only 84% and 80% healing, respectively (p < 0.005, both vs. 5 mg of fentanyl). in
contrast, there was only 65% healing in controls (figure
1d). the effect of the two higher concentrations of
fentanyl (5 and 0.5 mg/g) was statistically significant
(p < 0.002), whereas the lowest dose did not show a
statistically significant effect vs. controls. importantly,

100% wound closure was observed in fentanyl-treated
(5 mg/g cream) wounds on day 10 as compared to day 15
in pbs-treated wounds.
naloxone (0.4 mg/g cream), an opioid receptor
antagonist, prevented the wound healing effect of fentanyl (p < 0.001) and even inhibited healing of control
wounds significantly on day 10 (p < 0.005, naloxone vs.
control; figure 1d).
topical opioids affect wound histology and
angiogenesis
control wounds on day 8 were characterized by little
epidermal and dermal organization and thin granulation
layer (figure 2a). on the other hand, moderate-tocomplete reepithelialization with thick to very thick
granulation tissue was observed for opioid-treated
wounds. histological analysis thus revealed a nearly
healed morphology of the opioid-treated scars that is
consistent with the wound closure observations above.
however, fentanyl-treated wounds showed almost
completely healed histology and significantly higher
histological score as compared to moderate healing of

hydromorphone- or morphine-treated wounds (p < 0.03
fentanyl vs. hydromorphone or morphine; figures 2a
and b). overall, the histological scores (on a scale of
1–4, where 1 ¼ little epidermal organization/thin granulation and 4 ¼ complete dermal organization/very thick
granulation) were significantly higher for opioidtreated wounds vs. control (p < 0.005, each opioid vs.
control; figure 2b).
in corroboration, counting of dapi-stained nuclei
(representing number of cells in the wound sections)
revealed a 2.5-fold increase in the number of cells
in fentanyl-treated wounds, and less than a twofold
increase in hydromorphone- or morphine-treated
wounds as compared to control cream-treated
wounds (p < 0.05 control cream vs. others; figures 3a
and b). this was indicative of increased cell proliferation and/or decreased apoptosis in opioid-treated
wounds.

showed 45–87% higher neovascularization vs. control in
different parameters of angiogenesis including total
density, number of branches, total length, and number
of vessels (figure 3c). therefore, the increased number of dapi-positive nuclei could be due to increased
endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.
we observed a 20–30% increase in the band intensity of pcna in lysates from all three opioid-treated
wounds as compared to the lysates from the control
wounds (figure 4). thus, it is likely that promotion of
wound healing by opioids is accompanied also by cel-

lular proliferation. masson’s trichrome staining showed
increased collagen content in opioid-treated wounds,
which can be easily identified as blue color on wound
sections (figure 3a). however, it is also possible that
the increased proliferation and angiogenesis could be
due to improved healing by opioids. neovascularization and collagen staining were appreciably higher in
fentanyl-treated wounds compared to other opioids
tested here, consistent with our observation (figure
1) suggesting that fentanyl is a more potent wound
healer than other tested opioids.

vessel endothelial cells. therefore, the potentiating
effect of opioids on wound healing could be due to
their direct effect on angiogenesis and cell proliferation
and in part due to pro-angiogenic activity of increased

opioids stimulate intracellular signaling in the
wounds
upon western immunoblotting of lysates made from
the wound scars obtained on day 8 post treatment
(figure 4), we observed that both enos and inos
were up-regulated by all three opioids as compared to
control. densitometric analysis of the protein bands
showed about a 40% increase in opioid-induced inos
expression as compared to controls. in contrast, enos
expression was modestly increased by 20–30%, but
uniformly by all opioids. these data are suggestive of
increased inos activity of macrophages and other
nonendothelial cells, whereas modest enos expression
may be due to its expression only in vascular endothelium. thus, all three opioids stimulate the  xxxd2738xxx 
pathway within the wounds. this is reminiscent of
vegf-induced  xxxg1274xxx -mediated pro-angiogenic signaling
via no.
in fact, we find that opioids also up-regulate  xxxg1274xxx 
expression in wounds, which can be seen as red staining for  xxxg1274xxx  in the left panel (figure 5). the pbs-treated
wound sections do not show any bright red staining.
however, all three opioid-treated wound sections show
positive bright red immunofluorescent staining for
vegf receptor  xxxg1274xxx . dapi-stained nuclei show the
presence of the cells in each field. note that all the
cells do not stain for  xxxg1274xxx . this suggests that  xxxg1274xxx  is
expressed in a cell-specific manner only on blood

this study examines the simple question of whether
topically applied opioids hasten wound healing. while
this question appears frequently in studies on the peripheral use of opioid analgesics for pain relief,26 the
direct effect of opioids on wound healing have not been
examined. most importantly, opioid receptors are
present at the site of skin injury and may even be
activated.29 of relevance, opioids, including morphine
and b-endorphin, also stimulate interleukin-6 production (in rats),36,37 which has been suggested to promote
wound healing; wound healing is significantly delayed
in interleukin-6–deficient transgenic mice.38–40 therefore, faster healing of ischemic wounds by topical
opioids observed by us in this study is consistent with
all the above effects of opioids on peripheral tissues.
wound closure was accelerated particularly in the first
few days by opioids. therefore, the major effect of
opioids in this study was to shorten the lag phase
during the initial phase of healing. these results can
have direct implications in the healing of pathological
wounds accompanied by a long lag phase in the initial
healing process.
interestingly, morphine delivered systemically via
osmotic pumps and injections did not promote wound
healing. our observations complement earlier studies
that show low doses of opioids applied topically on
wounds directly provide better analgesic advantage
than the systemically delivered opioids.26,27 it is likely
that the peripheral opioid receptors mediate the healing
process in addition to providing analgesia. thus, the
direct availability of opioids to the site of injury is
probably required for the healing of wounds. indeed,
inhibition of fentanyl-induced as well as controlled
wound healing by naloxone suggests that opioid receptors at the site of injury are involved in the healing
process. moreover, endogenous opioid receptor agonist(s) via peripheral opioid receptors may be involved
in the healing process.
we observed that opioids promote the healing process both qualitatively and quantitatively as suggested
by increased granulation tissue and collagen formation,
epidermal and dermal organization, and angiogenesis.
as reported by our group earlier, morphine acts like the
endothelial growth promoting and angiogenic growth
factor vegf.21 the observed increase in cell density
and pcna in opioid-treated wounds is suggestive of the
growth promoting cytokine-like activity and/or prosurvival activity of opioids. these observations are

further supported by recent studies showing pro-survival
and pro-proliferative effect of opioids on different cell
types.22–24 however, increased collagen formation, cell
proliferation, granulation tissue formation, and angiogenesis in opioid-treated wounds could be a direct effect
of opioids and/or could be a result of improved healing.
recently, no signaling has been strongly implicated in the process of wound healing.8,10–13 we and
others have shown that morphine stimulates nomediated signaling.19,21 we found that both enos and
inos were up-regulated in the opioid-treated wounds.
these observations are in agreement with others showing morphine-induced stimulation of enos in endothelium and endogenous opioid-induced stimulation of
inos in splenocytes.19,20 we believe that opioids stimulate a sustained up-regulation of nos by activating
pkb/akt.21 nevertheless, both enos and inos are
involved in wound healing.13 wound healing is
impaired in both enos and inos knockout mice.14,15

we have shown earlier that morphine activates mapk/
erk via no.21 mapk/erk activation is also important
in epithelial sheet movement during wound healing.41,42
thus, sustained up-regulation of nos activates mapk,
resulting in increased cell proliferation, accelerated
epithelialization, and potentiation of wound healing.
all three opioids stimulate vegf receptor  xxxg1274xxx 
several fold as compared to pbs-treated wounds.
vegf has been proposed to contribute to wound repair
by promoting lymphatic vasculature formation and
angiogenesis via  xxxg1274xxx .43–47 pro-angiogenic signaling of
the increased vegf receptor could be contributing in
part to the healing effect of opioids observed by us.
so far there is no established satisfactory therapy
for accelerating impaired wound healing.1 proposed
strategies include growth factor application or expression of growth factors and cytokines in the wounds by
gene transfer.48 these therapies may cause secondary
complications, require hospitalization, and may even be

arduous for already distressed patients. opioids are
already used topically for pain management and do
not cause side-effects like dependence and tolerance
when used peripherally in low doses in rats or
humans.26,27,49 therefore, low topical doses of opioids
used in this study may not show central or peripheral
side-effects. it is speculated that pain can interfere with
wound healing.29 new perspectives on pain management promote the theory of activation of analgesic
cascades at the site of peripheral injury and the use of
opioids at the site of injury.50,51 therefore, in addition
to hastening wound healing, topically applied opioids
may also provide analgesic advantage to the patient.
taken together, the above data suggest that topical
application of opioids hastens healing of ischemic
wounds. opioids are approved for topical use in
humans for pain management. therefore, we are
cautiously optimistic that the results of this study can
be used clinically for potentiating wound healing.
