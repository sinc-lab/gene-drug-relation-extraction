abstract
a2-antiplasmin (a2ap) interferes with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin because lysine residues in its carboxy-terminal region
compete with those in fibrin, presumably the same way that free lysine or e- xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ) inhibits plasminogen binding to
fibrin. while this overall process causes an inhibition of fibrinolysis, the converse was observed with a 26-residue synthetic peptide (ap26)
corresponding to the carboxy-terminal region of a2ap. the ap26 peptide, in fact, accelerated urokinase-induced lysis of (1) fully crosslinked
fibrin with complete g-dimer and a-polymer formation; (2) partially crosslinked fibrin that had undergone only g-dimerization; and (3)
noncrosslinked fibrin. the ap26 peptide also inhibited  xxxg744xxx -catalyzed crosslinking of fibrin a-chains, and this also accelerated lysis
of fibrin.  xxxd146xxx  had no effect. in the presence of noncrosslinked fibrin, ap26 promoted plasminogen activation by urokinase and
fibrinolysis.  xxxd146xxx  only slightly increased the rate of plasminogen activation, and as expected, it inhibited fibrinolysis. since ap26 peptide
enhanced the lysis of partially crosslinked and noncrosslinked fibrin, our results indicate that inhibition of  xxxg744xxx -catalyzed a-polymer
formation by ap26, although associated with accelerated fibrinolysis, is not the primary mechanism. instead, our data support the conclusion
that ap26 enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin  5-fold, probably by inducing a conformational change in plasminogen
structure just as occurs with low concentrations of lysine or  xxxd146xxx . at higher concentrations, however, ap26 apparently does not approach
the avidity or affinity of lysine or  xxxd146xxx  for the kringle structures of plasminogen or plasmin so that their binding to fibrin is blocked.
whether ap26 alone, or as part of another molecule, could have potential for enhancing thrombolysis will require further study. d 2002

fibrinolysis [2– 4]. a2ap is composed of 452 amino acids
with three functional domains: (a) plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ) binding
sites in the carboxy-terminal region [5,6]; (b) the p1
reactive-site (arg364) loop [7,8]; and (c) the amino-terminal
region that contains glutamine (q2), which is the dominant
acceptor of e-(g-glutamyl)lysine crosslink formed within
fibrin [9]. recent results established that either chemical
modification or mutagenesis of arg364 caused complete
loss of plasmin-inhibitory activity [10,11]. if a2ap is
mutated (q2 ! a), it becomes crosslinked to fibrin at
approximately one-tenth the rate of wild-type a2ap [12].
the inhibition of plasmin by a2ap has been modeled as a
two-step process. initially, a reversible complex is rapidly
formed between the carboxy-terminal region of a2ap and
lysine-binding sites on plasmin [5,6]. this is then followed
by the relatively slow development of a covalently bonded

complex between the reactive-site arg364 of a2ap and the
active-site ser of plasmin [7]. results from amino acid
sequence alignments of a2ap and other serpins show that
a2ap has a 43 – 55-residue extension in its carboxyterminus when compared with other serpins [13]. specific
lysine residues in the carboxy-terminal 26-amino acid
sequence (ap26) of a2ap comprise the initial plasmin( xxxd2046xxx )-binding site on a2ap [5]. similarly, a synthetic ap26
peptide has been shown to competitively inhibit this
interaction by blocking lysine-binding sites of plasmin
while not affecting its catalytic site [14].
the same lysine-binding sites on plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ) also
interact with specific lysine residues in fibrin as well as
those in the carboxy-termini of its early degradation products to cause a conformational change in plasminogen that
continues to enhance its rate of activation during fibrinolysis
[15]. since the carboxy-terminal region of a2ap can
compete effectively with fibrin for the lysine binding sites
of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ), it might be anticipated that as a consequence, fibrinolysis would be slowed, and, indeed, aoki
et al. [16] suggested that the carboxy-terminal region of
a2ap inhibits fibrinolysis in a manner similar to e- xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ). a recent study from our laboratory,
however, showed that a synthetic carboxy-terminal peptide,
ap26, alone, or with an rgdf carboxy-terminal extension, actually augmented human plasma clot lysis [17]. we
now report further studies of the mechanisms giving rise to
this observation.

2. materals and methods
2.1. materials
gdklfgpdlklvppmeedypqfgspk (ap26),
rgdf, and dpprfvrplq peptides were synthesized
and purified by the molecular biology resource facility
in the university of oklahoma health sciences center,
oklahoma city, ok. the peptide structures were verified
by mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. stock
solution concentrations of each peptide were checked by
amino acid analyses. human fibrinogen (kabi, stockholm,
sweden) was treated with lysine-sepharose to remove
contaminating plasminogen [18] and then with 3.0 m urea
to inactivate contaminating factor xiii (fxiii) [19]. after
extensive dialysis at 4 c against tris-buffered saline
(50 mm tris – hcl, 150 mm nacl, ph 7.4), aliquots of
the fibrinogen solution were stored at  20 c. human
glu-plasminogen and fxiii were purified from fresh
plasma according to published methods [18,20]. protein
concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients of 1.62 [21], 1.7 [22], and 1.38 [23] for fibrinogen,
glu-plasminogen, and fxiii, respectively, for 1 mg/ml
solutions at a wavelength of 280 nm. human thrombin
was supplied by d.l. aronson (division of biological
standards, nih, bethesda, md). human plasmin was

purchased from chromogenix, molndal, sweden, and
dialysed against tris-buffered saline to remove lysine and
 xxxd146xxx . other reagents were obtained from the following
sources: urokinase (uk;  xxxd3478xxx ) (abbott, chicago
il); s2251 (vlk-pna) (chromogenix); and  xxxd146xxx 
(sigma, st. louis, mo).
2.2. uk-induced degradation of fibrin
unless otherwise stated, fibrin clots were formed at
37 c for 2 h in a total volume of 50 ml of tris-buffered
saline and final concentrations of 6 mm fibrinogen, 0.5 mm
glu-plasminogen, 70 nm fxiii, 5 u/ml thrombin, 12 mm
cacl2 and selected concentrations of ap26. after the fibrin
clots were dislodged from the tube walls, uk (12 ml) was
added to each to give a final concentration of 2 u/ml, and
the clots were then incubated at 37 c. at selected
incubation times, uk-induced fibrin degradation was
stopped by addition of 100 ml of tris-buffered solubilizing
solution (50 mm tris – hcl, ph 7.4, 9 m urea, 3% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx , and 40 mm dithiothreitol), and samples
were allowed to dissolve for 1 h at 37 c before electrophoresis [24].
2.3.  xxxd3215xxx  – polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (sds –page)
sds – page was performed as previously described
[25]. approximately 14 mg of protein were applied per well
and electrophoresed for 15 h  xxxd1891xxx  ma/gel on 7.5% polyacrylamide slab gels using a biorad vertical slab unit. to
visualize proteins, gels were stained and destained with a
fast stain kit (zoion, allston, ma) according to the
manufacturer’s directions.
2.4. analysis of activated factor xiii (fxiiia)-mediated
fibrin crosslinking
crosslinking reactions were carried out at 37 c for 2 h
in tris-buffered saline (ph 7.4) containing 6 mm fibrinogen, 70 nm fxiii, 5 u/ml thrombin, 12 mm cacl2 and
selected concentrations of ap26. for control reactions,
12 mm edta replaced cacl2. crosslinking was terminated by adding tris-buffered solubilizing solution, and
each fibrin sample completely dissolved after a 1 h of
incubation at 37 c. each solubilized sample was then
analyzed by sds –page as described above. destained
gels were equilibrated with 20% ethanol –10% glycerol for
1 h and dried between two cellophane sheets using geldrying frames (diversified biotech, boston, ma). each
protein band in a dried gel was quantitated using a gs-670
imaging densitometer (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa) and
image analysis software (molecular analyst, version 1.1).
protein bands in the top part of 4.5% polyacrylamide
stacking gels were quantitated and expressed as the amount
of a-polymer formed [26].

2.5. fibrin clot lysis time (fclt)
fclt experiments were carried out in a purified system
containing selected concentrations of ap26 (or  xxxd146xxx ),
6 mm fibrinogen, 0.5 mm glu-plasminogen, 5 u/ml thrombin, 12 mm cacl2, 3 u/ml uk, 50 mm tris – hcl, ph
7.4, and 150 mm nacl [27]. ap26 (or  xxxd146xxx ), fibrinogen,
and plasminogen were preincubated for 10 min at 22 c
before adding the mixture of uk, thrombin, and cacl2.
fibrin clots were formed and appeared turbid within
2 min. turbidity was monitored at 405 nm on a microtiter
plate reader (vmax, molecular devices, menlo park, ca).
the fclt was determined as the midpoint between the
maximum absorbance and the baseline lower absorbance
[28]. to study the effect of ap26 on the digestion of
preformed fibrin by plasmin, selected concentrations of
ap26, 6 mm fibrinogen, 0.07 mm plasmin, 5 u/ml thrombin, 12 mm cacl2 were incubated in the same buffer at
22 c. the fibrin formed in each reaction mixture was
monitored at 405 nm, with lysis being reflected by decreasing turbidity.
2.6. glu-plasminogen activation
the effect of ap26 or  xxxd146xxx  on uk-induced plasminogen activation was examined by the following coupled
reactions [15]:

experimental conditions were the same as in the fclt
assays except for the addition of 0.3 mm s2251. ap26 (or
 xxxd146xxx ), s2251, fibrinogen, and glu-plasminogen were
preincubated for 10 min at 22 c, and then a freshly mixed
solution of uk, thrombin, and cacl2 was immediately
added. absorbance at 405 nm was monitored with time
on the vmax kinetic microplate reader. to eliminate the
turbidity effect of fibrin on absorbance, a405 values of paranitroanilide (pna) generation were obtained by subtracting
absorbance in the absence of s2251 from that in the
presence of s2251. using a computer program (origin;
microcal, northamton, ma), a405 values plotted against
the square of time gave a linear relationship for early time
points. the slopes of these lines were directly proportional
to the rate of plasminogen activation [29].

3. results and discussion
in a previous report from our laboratory, ap26 was
shown to augment the lysis of fibrin clots derived from

265

human plasma [17], but how this occurred was not investigated. several questions emerged: (i) does ap26 directly
inhibit fxiiia activity so that any generated fibrin would
have fewer crosslinks and, hence, be more susceptible to
lysis? (ii) does ap26 compete with fibrin monomers for
crosslink sites, particularly on the a-chains, to produce a
fibrin network structure that is less compact, less crosslinked, and more easily digested? (iii) do lysine residues in
the carboxy-terminal region of ap26 bind plasminogen,
causing a conformational change that accelerates plasminogen activation by uk? (iv) does ap26 compete with fibrin
for the lysine binding sites of plasminogen/plasmin, and as a
consequence, slow the fibrinolytic process?
3.1. effect of ap26 on uk-activated plasmin digestion of
crosslinked fibrin
initially, the effect of ap26 concentration on plasmin
digestion of fully g-dimerized and a-polymerized fibrin was
examined in a purified system containing ap26, fibrinogen,
fxiii, glu-plasminogen, thrombin, cacl2, and uk. physiological plasma concentrations of fibrinogen (6 mm), fxiii
(70 nm), and approximately one-third (0.5 mm) of the
plasma concentration of glu-plasminogen were used, the
latter based on the estimated available free plasminogen
after correction for that complexed with plasma proteins
such as histidine-rich glycoprotein [30] and a2ap [31].
after adding thrombin and cacl2, the reaction mixture
was incubated for 2 h to maximize a-chain crosslinking
[26], and then uk was added to initiate lysis. fxiiia is a
ca2 + -dependent plasma transglutaminase required for both
the rapid catalysis of g-chain dimerization and the slower
polymerization of a-chains. fig. 1 shows sds – page
patterns of uk-induced plasmin-digested crosslinked fibrin
over a range of ap26 concentrations. lane 1 shows the
molecular weight standards. lane 2 shows a control sample
of fully crosslinked fibrin in the absence of uk and ap26,
and as expected, large amounts of a-polymer, g-dimer
(ga –g’ or ga – ga), and b-monomer are apparent. lane 3
shows that in the presence of uk, the gel pattern contains
not only a-polymer, g-dimer, and b-monomer, but also
several early digestion products, degraded g-chains, and b00
[26]. as shown in lanes 4 –6, the presence of ap26 during
crosslinking clearly resulted in accelerated fibrin digestion
by plasmin in a dose-dependent manner. complete proteolysis and disappearance of a-polymers occurred between
100 and 1000 mm of ap26.
3.2. inhibition of fxiiia-catalyzed a-polymer formation
by ap26
resistance to fibrinolysis is believed to correlate with
both fxiiia-catalyzed crosslinking among a-chains [32,33]
and crosslinking of a2ap [9] to each a-chain during the
formation of polymerized fibrin networks. more recently, it
has been reported that fibrinolysis resistance may actually

266

ratio of 200:1. in these studies, the rate of fibrin formation
was not affected by ap26,  xxxd146xxx , or any of the peptides
listed above, indicating that none were giving rise to
thrombin inhibition. however, ap26 could have bound to
a-chains in a manner, which would sterically impede crosslink formation during fibrin clot formation.

fig. 1. effect of ap26 on digestion of a-polymer-containing crosslinked
fibrin. crosslinked fibrin clots were formed by clotting fibrinogen in the
presence of ap26, fibrinogen, glu-plasminogen, fxiii, and cacl2 with
thrombin for 2 h as described in the materials and methods. uk was added,
and plasmin digestion was allowed to proceed for 60 min. lanes 1 and 2:
reduced sds – page analyses of molecular weight standards and highly
crosslinked fibrin formed in the absence of uk and ap26, respectively.

ap26, respectively.

correlate better with g-chain multimerization [34]; however,
it is unlikely that this occurred under our experimental
conditions. to explain how ap26 might enhance fibrinolysis, the effect of ap26 on fxiiia-mediated a-polymer
formation was evaluated by reduced sds –page analyses
of fibrin samples (fig. 2a). lane 1 shows the pattern of
noncrosslinked fibrin, which was allowed to form in the
presence of edta; neither a-chain crosslinking nor
g-dimerization is present. lane 2 shows the pattern for
crosslinked fibrin formed in the presence of cacl2, and in
this instance, a-polymer and g-dimer are abundant. lanes
3 – 7 demonstrate that with increasing concentrations of
ap26, the amount of a-crosslinking was progressively
decreased, but ap26 had no effect on g-dimerization. lanes
8 – 9, however, show that  xxxd146xxx  (an analogue of the
carboxy-terminal lysine of ap26) in final concentrations
of 1 and 6 mm did not cause inhibition of a-crosslinking or
g-dimerization. moreover, two lysine-free peptides, rgdf
and dpprfvrplq, and one lysine-containing peptide,
ghaksrpv, had no inhibitory effect on a-crosslink
formation (data not shown), indicating that ap26 was not
merely acting as a nonspecific inhibitor of fxiiia-catalyzed
a-polymer formation.
while fig. 2b shows that ap26 inhibited a-polymerization, a very high concentration was required to achieve an
ic50, namely, 1.2 mm of ap26 at an ap26/fibrin molar

fig. 2. effect of ap26 on fxiiia-catalyzed a-polymer formation. fibrin
clots were prepared using selected concentrations of ap26 or  xxxd146xxx  as
described in the materials and methods, and reduced samples were
analyzed by sds – page. (a) lanes 1 and 2: fibrin formed in the
presence of edta and cacl2, respectively. lanes 3 – 7: fibrin formed in
the presence of ap26 at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mm, respectively. lanes 8

mean value of triplicate and duplicate experiments for ap26 (&) and
 xxxd146xxx  ( ), respectively.

while it was possible that ap26 might interact specifically with fibrin a-chains as a fxiiia substrate, this was
not supported by the following results: (i) analyses of
reduced sds – page patterns in fig. 2a of fully crosslinked fibrin formed in the presence of ap26 did not show
higher mw bands appropriate to the incorporation of
ap26 into a-chains. (ii) western blots on duplicate gels
to those in fig. 2a showed no higher mw bands that
reacted with a specific antibody to ap26 peptide [35]. (iii)
mass spectrometric analysis [12] of a fxiiia-reaction
mixture of 5-(biotinamido) xxxd141xxx  and ap26 revealed
that 5-(biotinamido) xxxd141xxx  was not incorporated into
any gln in the ap26 peptide, although fxiiia did catalyze
5-(biotinamido) xxxd141xxx  labeling of gln447 in intact
a2ap [12]. a patient has been reported with an antibody
that inhibited fxiiia binding to fibrin, and while having
no effect on g-dimer formation, it completely blocked
a-polymerization [36]. this observation gives rise to the
speculation that ap26 may function similarly.
3.3. effect of ap26 on plasmin digestion of partially
crosslinked fibrin
we then speculated that if a fibrinolytic-enhancing effect
of ap26 occurred by inhibiting the formation of a-crosslinked polymers, then lysis of fibrin that contained only
g-dimers should not be affected by the presence of ap26 at
any concentration. fig. 3, however, shows the converse.
lane 1 shows the reduced sds –page pattern of a control
sample of partially crosslinked fibrin, which was formed by
adding thrombin and uk to a mixture of fibrinogen, gluplasminogen, fxiii, and cacl2, and then incubating for
60 min at 37 c. by 60 min, essentially no a-polymers had
formed, and other than g-dimers and b-chains, only a small
amount of the b-chain degradation product, the b00-subunit,
could be seen. the lack of visible a-polymers could have
been due to rapid cleavage of a-chains of fibrin monomers
prior to polymer formation, or because a-polymers, once
formed, were quickly digested, since under the conditions
used to form fibrin, fxiiia and plasmin will almost
assuredly be generated at the same time. lanes 2– 4 show
that fibrin proteolysis increased in direct proportion to ap26
concentration as evident by progressively larger amounts of
digestion products on the gels. lane 5 shows that if  xxxd146xxx 
was substituted for ap26, a-polymerization still occurred,
and fibrin proteolysis was diminished. the exact opposite
was observed when ap26 was present during a-chain
polymerization: polymerization was diminished and fibrin
proteolysis was accelerated. yet, when data from figs. 2 and
3 are taken into account, it appears that inhibition of
a-polymerization by ap26, and as a consequence, a less
polymerized fibrin structure was not the explanation for the
increased fibrinolysis. interestingly, these latter results are
in accord with a recent report suggesting that resistance
of fibrin to digestion by plasmin is not dependent on
a-polymerization [34].

fig. 3. effect of ap26 on digestion of a-polymer-free crosslinked fibrin.
fibrin clotting and lysis were simultaneously initiated by adding thrombin
and uk into solutions containing fibrinogen, glu-plasminogen, fxiii,
cacl2, and specified concentrations of ap26 or  xxxd146xxx . after 60 min of
digestion, each sample was reduced and analyzed by sds – page. lane 1:
control pattern of fibrin subunits when buffer substituted for ap26 or
 xxxd146xxx . it is evident that a-polymerization was absent and that g-dimer and
b-monomer were minimally degraded. lane2 – 4: both g-dimer and
b-monomer digestion products accumulated in direct proportion to ap26
concentration (10, 100, and 1000 mm, respectively). lane 5: obvious
a-polymer formed at the top of the gel when 100 mm  xxxd146xxx  was present on
initiation of fibrin clotting, and virtually no lysis occurred by 60 min.

3.4. ap26 effect on plasmin digestion of noncrosslinked
fibrins
the effects of ap26 were compared with  xxxd146xxx  on
fclt at 22 c by a turbidimetric microtiter plate assay
[27,28], using the same conditions for fibrin formation as
for the sds – page analyses in fig. 3, except that no fxiii
was added. fig. 4 shows fclt patterns for noncrosslinked
fibrin clots formed in the presence of 100 mm ap26 or
 xxxd146xxx  or, as a control, in the absence of both. in addition to
the buffer control shown in fig. 4, a second control was
also performed using a nonspecific, non-lysine-containing
peptide, dpprfvrplq. both controls gave fclts of
97 min. in the case of ap26 or  xxxd146xxx , however, fclts
were 68 and 122 min, respectively, for a 100 mm concentration, demonstrating that fibrinolysis was enhanced by
ap26 and inhibited by  xxxd146xxx . fig. 4 shows an increase in
turbidity between 45 and 65 min for the ap26-containing
sample. this increase, which occurs just before a rapid
decline of turbidity, may represent a lessened ability for
fibrin to effect an orderly, albeit temporary, repolymerization when ap26 is present during the very earliest stages of
fibrin digestion; or perhaps the increased light scattering
effect is caused by greater binding of ap26 to fibrin fibers

ap26 (&),  xxxd146xxx  ( ), or buffer only (a). fclts were defined as
midpoint times (8). the accelerating effect of ap26 contrasts sharply with
the inhibitory effect of  xxxd146xxx .



just before the dramatic increase in lysis. however, we did
not pursue further data to support either of these suggestions. table 1 shows comparisons of the concentration
effects of ap26 and  xxxd146xxx  on fclts. ap26 clearly
shortened fclts in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
 xxxd146xxx  gave opposite results in that fclts were prolonged
up to 100 mm, but at 1000 mm, inhibition was slightly less.
these findings with  xxxd146xxx  are in accord with previous
reports [16]. data from figs. 1, 3, and 4 demonstrate that
ap26 accelerated the degradation of both crosslinked and
noncrosslinked fibrin. however, table 1 shows that if
preformed plasmin was used in clotting mixtures instead
of uk and plasminogen, ap26 inhibited fibrinolysis in a
dose –response fashion, suggesting that ap26 may act as a
competitor of fibrin for the binding of plasmin. when
considered together, these results support the interpretation
that ap26 acts by enhancing the activation of plasminogen
rather than by inhibiting a-chain polymerization to make
fibrin more susceptible to proteolysis.
3.5. ap26 acceleration of uk-induced plasminogen
activation in the presence of fibrin
previous work from our laboratory showed that ap26
accelerated plasmin generation in an assay system containing the plasmin-specific substrate s2251, uk, and plasminogen [17]. the same assay system was used in the
present study, except that additional fibrinogen and thrombin were added to the mixture for determining plasmin
generation rates in a fibrin-containing milieu. as shown in
table 1, plasmin generation and fibrinolysis were both
progressively accelerated with increasing concentrations of
ap26. the faster rate of plasminogen activation and
plasmin generation resulted in increased rates of fibrinolysis as reflected by the shorter fclts. plasmin generation
was also accelerated in response to increasing concentrations of  xxxd146xxx , but fibrinolytic rates slowed, presumably
because of inhibition of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ) binding to fibrin
[37,38]. however, fibrinolysis was more inhibited by

100 mm than by 1000 mm. this result can be explained
by considering both the data of aoki et al. [16] and ours in
table 1. at a concentration of 1000 mm  xxxd146xxx , the
plasminogen activation rate is increased more than threefold compared to that observed at 100 mm  xxxd146xxx  (table 1).
however, at 1000 mm,  xxxd146xxx  inhibited binding of plasminogen to fibrin  5-fold greater than 100 mm  xxxd146xxx  [16],
and, overall, despite the enhancement of plasminogen
activation by  xxxd146xxx , lysis was decreased. in the case of
ap26, its two most carboxy-terminal lysines were assumed
to bind plasminogen kringles 1 + 2 + 3 as well as kringle
4 [39] and induce a conformational change in plasminogen
similar to that caused by  xxxd146xxx  [38]. miles et al. [40]
showed that a peptide containing the carboxy-terminal
19 amino acids of a2ap inhibited plasminogen binding
to cell surface proteins that possess carboxy-terminal
lysines [40], suggesting that the latter are, indeed, likely
to interact with lysine-binding sites on the kringle structures in native plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ). also supporting this inference is the study by wiman et al. [41] in which two lysine
residues in the carboxy-terminal region of a2ap were
shown to compete with lysine residues in fibrin that bind
plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ). our results, in combination with work
reported by others [39 –41], support the conclusion that
even if ap26 does inhibit the interaction of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx )
with fibrin to some extent, its net effect is to actually
enhance the lysis of fibrin  2-fold by accelerating plasminogen activation by uk. inhibition of fibrinolysis was
never observed by us, even at relatively high concentrations of ap26, and this is in keeping with a previous
report, which concluded that inhibition of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx )
binding to fibrin by a2ap does not significantly affect
fibrinolysis [42].

each value is shown as the mean ± s.d. of three experiments.
plasminogen activation rate was obtained by linear regression
analysis from the slope of plots of a405 vs. min2 as described under the
materials and methods. each value inside parentheses is expressed as ‘‘fold
increase’’ (fraction of the slope in the presence of ap26 or  xxxd146xxx  divided
by the slope when buffer only was present).
c
values are for two separate experiments.

3.6. concluding remarks
we conclude the following: (i) ap26 accelerates ukinduced fibrinolysis of crosslinked and noncrosslinked
fibrin clots. (ii) ap26 inhibits fxiiia-catalyzed fibrin
a-chain polymerization, but not g-chain dimerization. (iii)
ap26 is not incorporated into fibrin a-chain. (iv) ap26
enhances uk-induced plasminogen activation in the presence of fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ). the fact that ap26 peptide enhances
fibrinolysis raises the possibility that were it linked to
peptide(s) that also interfered with the crosslinking of
a2ap to fibrin, subsequently, newly formed fibrin might
be digested at much lower fibrinolytic activity levels, such
as those generated endogenously, or exogenously by very
small doses of activators. interestingly, schense and hubbell
[43] have shown that among several putative fxiiia peptide
substrates, a hybrid peptide containing the amino-terminal
eight-residue peptides of a2ap was the easiest to incorporate into fibrin. in accord with this observation, the a2ap
amino-terminal 12-residue peptide at  0.5 mm was later
shown to competitively inhibit the crosslinking of plasma
a2ap to fibrin, and presumably, as a consequence, to
enhance fibrinolysis [44]. it is conceivable that if a hybrid
peptide were constructed to contain limited amino-terminal
and carboxy-terminal regions of a2ap, its amino-terminal
domain might compete with native a2ap for becoming
specifically crosslinked to fibrin by fxiiia catalysis. the
carboxy-terminal segment of such a hybrid peptide should
augment the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. the
combination of both effects should fibrin considerably more
susceptible to proteolysis.
