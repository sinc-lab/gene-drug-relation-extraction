summary
a potential adverse effect of cyclo-oxygenase (cox) inhibitors
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [nsaids]) in horses is
colitis. in addition, we have previously shown an important role
forcox-produced prostanoids in recovery of ischaemic-injured
equine jejunum. it was hypothesised that the nonselective cox
inhibitor flunixin would retard repair of bile-injured colon by
preventing production of reparative prostaglandins, whereas the
selective cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd2065xxx  would not inhibit repair as a
result of continued  xxxg1883xxx  activity. segments of the pelvic
flexure were exposed to 1.5 mmol/l  xxxd1835xxx  for 30 min,
after which they were recovered for 4 h in ussing chambers.
contrary to the proposed hypothesis, recovery of bile-injured
colonic mucosa was not affected by flunixin or  xxxd2065xxx , despite
significantly depressed prostanoid production. however,
treatment of control tissue with flunixin led to increases in
mucosal permeability, whereas treatment with  xxxd2065xxx  had no
significant effect. therefore, although recovery from bileinduced colonic injury maybe independent of cox-elaborated
prostanoids, treatment of control tissues with nonselective cox
inhibitors may lead to marked increases in permeability.
alternatively, selective inhibition of cox-2 may reduce the
incidence of adverse effects in horses requiring nsaid therapy.
introduction
in equine medicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) are used to control orthopaedic pain (usually due to
degenerative joint disease) and abdominal pain (colic) by
inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (cox) and preventing the
production of prostaglandins (pgs). however, a number of
adverse effects of nsaids have been noted in horses, including
gastrointestinal ulceration (snow et al. 1981), right dorsal colitis
(simmons et al. 1990) and renal papillary necrosis (collins and
tyler 1984). mucosal blood flow to the right dorsal colon can be
increased or decreased by pgs. it is hypothesised that a decrease
in blood flow attributable to administration of nsaids may be
involved in triggering colitis. this may explain why toxicity is
most frequently noted in hypovolaemic patients (simmons et al.
1990). however, toxic effects of nsaids (phenylbutazone) in the
colon have also been noted in normovolaemic horses given

therapeutic dosages (cohen et al. 1995). there may also be
nonvascular mechanisms that contribute to nsaid toxicity that
have yet to be identified.
colitis is frequently fatal in the horse. the primary reason for
death is shock associated with the absorption of bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
(lps)
from
damaged
intestine.
lipopolysaccharide induces production of pgs that exacerbate
circulatory shock and abdominal pain (king and gerring 1989).
however, prostaglandins also have beneficial effects in the
gastrointestinal tract. for example, pge2 stimulates restitution; an
epithelial repair mechanism that re-surfaces denuded mucosa
(zushi et al. 1996). prostaglandins have also been shown to
restore barrier function of ischaemic-injured intestinal mucosa,
possibly via an action on interepithelial tight junctions (blikslager
et al. 1997). therefore, the complete inhibition of prostanoids may
prevent intestinal recovery in horses with colitis.
prostaglandins are produced by 2 distinct cyclo-oxygenases:
 xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 (xie et al. 1991). cyclo-oxygenase-1 is
constitutively expressed in most tissues, including the gut.  xxxg1884xxx  is not expressed under normal conditions in the
gastrointestinal tract, but is induced by a variety of stimuli,
particularly lps (vane et al. 1994), and is expressed
predominantly at sites of inflammation. based on their pattern of
expression, it has been suggested that  xxxg1883xxx  is responsible for
‘house-keeping’ functions, such as maintenance of the intestinal
epithelial barrier, whereas cox-2 is responsible for producing
prostaglandins that amplify shock, inflammation and pain (ferraz
et al. 1997). therefore, selective cox-2 inhibitors may inhibit the
production of pgs responsible for amplifying pain and shock,
while allowing continued  xxxg1883xxx  production of pgs responsible
for repair of the epithelial barrier. recent studies in our laboratory
support this by showing that ischaemic-injured equine jejunal
mucosa fails to recover during in vitro testing in the presence of
flunixin, while recovery was not inhibited by the cox-2 inhibitor
 xxxd2065xxx  (campbell and blikslager 2000). however, other studies
have shown an important role for cox-2-elaborated prostanoids
in recovery of ulcerated gastric mucosa (mizuno et al. 1997)
suggesting that local upregulation of this enzyme may provide
important reparative prostanoids. cycloxygenase-2 may also have
anti-inflammatory properties, especially in chronic inflammatory
conditions (gilroy et al. 1999).
in the present study, a model of colonic injury extrapolated
from previous porcine studies was used (argenzio et al. 1988) in
which equine colon was treated with bile salts, and recovery was

monitored in vitro within ussing chambers. it was hypothesised
that the nonselective cox inhibitor flunixin (landoni and lees
1995) would retard repair of bile-injured large colon by preventing
production of reparative pgs whereas the selective cox-2
inhibitor,  xxxd2065xxx  (riendeau et al. 1997) would permit repair as a
result of continued  xxxg1883xxx  pg production.

ussing chamber studies

materials and methods
experimental horses and surgery
all procedures were approved by the north carolina state
university institutional animal care and use committee. seven
horses (age 5–15 years, weight 450–550 kg) were quarantined for
2 weeks prior to the start of the study and had physical
examination parameters within normal limits. the horses were
sedated with xylazine (1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.), anaesthetised with
diazepam (0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) and ketamine (2.2 mg/kg bwt i.v.),
intubated and maintained on halothane vapourised in 100%
oxygen. anaesthetic monitoring included arterial blood pressure,
electrocardiography and arterial blood gas analysis. maintenance
fluids (lactated ringer ’s solution [lrs] at 15 ml/kg bwt/h) were
administered i.v. via a jugular catheter. the large colon was
exteriorised via a ventral midline incision and the pelvic flexure
identified. two 30 cm loops were created in the pelvic flexure
without compromising the blood supply and identified randomly
as control or bile-injured. a 5 l bag of lrs containing
deoxycholate1 at a final concentration of 1.5 mmol/l was
connected to an i.v. fluid pump2 via i.v. pump tubing2. the tubing
was placed into the lumen of one end of the colon loop and
secured with a pursestring suture. a separate piece of i.v. pump
tubing was placed into the lumen of the colon at the other end of
the loop, sutured into place and re-attached to the bag of
 xxxd1835xxx  solution. this created a recirculating pump system
to perfuse the colonic lumen with 1.5 mmol/l  xxxd1835xxx . a
similar system was created in the control loop, except that lrs
containing no additional treatment was used. after 30 min, biletreated and control loops were resected and the horses were
humanely destroyed with an overdose of pentobarbital.

the colon loops were incised along the anti-mesenteric surface.
the mucosa was stripped from the seromuscular layer in
oxygenated (95%o2/5%co2) equine ringer’s solution (campbell
and blikslager 2000) containing either no treatment, 2.7 x
10-5 mol/l etodolac1 or 2.7 x 10-5 mol/l flunixin meglumine3 and
mounted in ussing chambers, as described in previous studies
(argenzio et al. 1993). the concentration of flunixin was
extrapolated from a peak serum level of 8 µg/ml of flunixin
reached at a dose of 1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. according to previous
studies (freeman et al. 1997). the dose of  xxxd2065xxx  was matched
to that of flunixin and both drugs were diluted in
dimethylsulphoxide to form stable solutions. tissues were exposed
to treatments from the start of the in vitro portion of the
experiment. tissues were bathed on the serosal and mucosal sides
with 10 ml equine ringer’s solution. the serosal bathing solution
contained 10 mmol/l glucose, and was osmotically balanced on the
mucosal side with 10 mmol/l mannitol. bathing solutions were
oxygenated (95%o2/5%co2) and circulated in water-jacketed
reservoirs at 37°c. the spontaneous potential difference (pd) was
measured using ringer-agar bridges connected to calomel
electrodes, and the pd was short-circuited through ag-agcl
electrodes using a voltage clamp that corrected for fluid resistance.
resistance (omega.cm2) was calculated from the spontaneous pd and
short-circuit current (isc). if the spontaneous pd was between -1.0
and 1.0 mv, tissues were current clamped at ± 100 µa for 5 s and
the pd recorded. short-circuit current and pd were recorded every
15 min for 4 h. the data were entered into spreadsheets that
calculate resistance (r) from isc and pd using ohm’s law.
histological studies
tissues were taken immediately following the surgical procedures
and at the end of ussing chamber experiments for routine
histology (5 µm cross-sections taken at 300 µm intervals and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin). a grade scale (0, no damage,
to 4, extensive damage) was used to assess the amount of damage
according to previous descriptions (henrikson et al. 1989).

assays were performed by the centre for gastrointestinal
biology and disease, chapel hill, nc, using commercial
elisa kits4.
flux measurements
to assess tissue permeability to lps, mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of
salmonella typhimurium lps5 were initiated by
adding 0.2 µci/ml to the mucosal solution of tissues. following a
15 min equilibration period, standards were taken from the
bathing reservoirs. subsequently, three 1 h fluxes were performed
by taking samples from the serosal bathing reservoirs. samples
were assessed for ß emission (counts/min). mucosal-to-serosal
fluxes of 14c-lps (jms) were determined using standard equations
(argenzio and liacos 1990).

eicosanoid measurements
samples of the serosal bathing solutions (0.5 ml) were taken
1 h from the start and at the end of the experiments (4 h). these
samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -70°c
and analysed for 6-keto-pgf1alpha (a stable metabolite of pgi2)

statistical analysis
since all data were normally distributed, parametric tests were
used for all analyses. for experiments with multiple values
recorded over a 240 min period, 2-way anova on repeated
measures was performed for the effects of time and treatment,
and time-treatment interactions. a post hoc tukey’s test was
used to test for statistical differences between treatments. for
analyses with a significant time-treatment interaction, one-way
anova was performed at select time points to distinguish
differences between treatments. for all other data, a one-way
anova was performed to discern significant differences
between treatments. for all statistical analyses a p value of <0.05
was considered significant.

results
ussing chamber studies
tissues exposed to 1.5 mmol/l  xxxd1835xxx  for 30 min had
transepithelial resistance (ter) measurements approximately
one third that of control tissues at the beginning of the experiment
(fig 1). control tissue showed a relatively stable ter over the
4 h period of the experiment. the ter of untreated bile-injured
tissue showed a gradual recovery response with a 2-fold increase
in ter over 4 h. however, there were no significant differences
between the treatment groups, although there was a tendency for
flunixin and  xxxd2065xxx  to reduce recovery of ter (fig 1).
treatment effects were far more noticeable in control tissues.
over the last 2 h period of the experiment, there was a significant
decrease in ter between control tissue and control tissue treated

histopathological examination of mucosa immediately after
30 min of exposure to 1.5 mmol/l  xxxd1835xxx , regardless of
treatment, showed a median damage grade of 3.5 (range 1–4, loss
of single cells to barren surface with sloughed epithelial sheets).
after 4 h in the ussing chambers, evidence of epithelial restitution
was noted, resulting in continuous epithelial coverage regardless
of treatment group (fig 3). in control tissues, there was no
histological evidence of mucosal damage at the beginning of the
ussing chamber experiments or at the end of the 240 min recovery
period regardless of treatment.
eicosanoid measurements
there were significant (p<0.05) increases in 6-keto-pgf1alpha and
txb2 concentrations in the serosal bathing solution in control
tissues and bile-injured tissue that received no treatment at hour 4
compared to hour 1 of the experiment (figs 4–7). there was also
a significant difference between 6-keto-pgf1alpha and txb2
concentrations in bile-injured tissue that received no treatment
compared to bile-injured tissue treated with  xxxd2065xxx  and flunixin.
however, there was no significant difference in eicosanoid
concentrations in bile-injured tissue treated with  xxxd2065xxx  or
flunixin at hour 4 when compared to hour 1 of the study. there
was no significant difference in txb2 concentration in control
tissue treated with  xxxd2065xxx  or flunixin. however, there was a
significant difference in the 6-keto-pgf1alpha concentration in control
tissue treated with flunixin when compared to control tissue
treated with  xxxd2065xxx  (p<0.05).

discussion
transepithelial resistance (ter) is a highly sensitive measure of the
ionic permeability of intestinal mucosa. recent studies have shown
close correlations between recovery of ter and reductions in
mucosal permeability in ischaemic-injured tissues treated with
prostaglandins (blikslager et al. 1997). from the ter data in the
present studies, it can be seen that exposure to 1.5 mmol/l
 xxxd1835xxx  caused significant damage to the mucosa of the colon
35 ± 1.8 omega.cm2 compared to 104 ± 14.7 omega.cm2 in control tissue).
the ter of the bile-injured tissue increased to 92 ±
11.7 omega.cm2 after 4 h, indicating the ability of the tissue to initiate a
recovery response in this ex vivo preparation. the significant
recovery of ter in bile-injured tissues occurred in conjunction with
an improvement in the histological indices measured, suggesting
that recovery of ter was attributable to epithelial restitution. in
contrast to previous studies on ischaemic-injured jejunum, there
was no significant inhibitory effect of flunixin on tissue recovery.
some studies indicate that  xxxd2065xxx  is less selective for cox-2
than other inhibitors (giuliano et al. 2001), suggesting that the
lack of difference between the effects of flunixin and  xxxd2065xxx  in
bile-injured tissue may relate to their ability to inhibit both cox
isoforms. the selectivity, which is usually calculated using
 xxxg1883xxx :cox-2 ic50 ratio, is dependent on the type of cox in
vitro selectivity assay used. therefore, a pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic approach assessing whole animal
measurements of potency and selectivity should be used to
support or refute the results of in vitro assays (toutain et al. 2001).
the reasons that flunixin inhibited recovery of equine
ischaemic-injured tissue, but not equine bile-injured tissue, may

fig 8: mean ± s.e. from 7 animals of mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of

evidence of diminished colonic barrier function in tissues treated with
flunixin, there was a significant increase in flux of lps when compared to

(*p<0.05 vs., control or  xxxd2065xxx -treated tissues, 1-way anova).
14c-labelled lipopolysaccharide (lps)

relate to distinct mechanisms of repair in the 2 models. in
ischaemic-injured jejunum, there was no observable histological
difference between tissues treated with or without flunixin, showing
that changes in paracellular resistance, regulated by interepithelial
tight junctions, may be responsible for differences in treatment
groups (campbell and blikslager 2000). this supposition is
supported by a number of studies performed in ischaemic-injured
porcine ileum, which have shown that prostaglandins play a critical
role in recovery of mucosal paracellular resistance (blikslager et al.
1997, 1999). in contrast, the repair mechanism that appears to
dominate recovery of bile-injured colon would appear to be
epithelial restitution. porcine studies utilising the same model
support this premise (argenzio et al. 1988; henrikson et al. 1989).
treatment of control tissue with  xxxd2065xxx  or flunixin had more
dramatic effects than treatment of bile-injured tissues. in particular,
there were significant decreases in ter over the last 2 h of the
experiment under the influence of either  xxxd2065xxx  or flunixin, but
flunixin was significantly more damaging than  xxxd2065xxx . these
data suggest an important role of prostanoids in the maintenance of
mucosal barrier function, as has been shown in numerous studies
in other species (robert 1984; wallace 1992). although cox
inhibitors may have direct topical irritant effects (liversidge et al.
1989), eicosanoid analyses in the present study suggest that the
effects of flunixin and  xxxd2065xxx  on control tissue are attributable to
reductions in prostaglandin and thromboxane levels. although both
drugs prevented elevations in txb2 over the 4 h recovery period in
control tissues,  xxxd2065xxx  inhibited 6-keto-pgf1alpha to a lesser extent
than flunixin. this suggests that the residual concentration of this
prostanoid following  xxxd2065xxx  treatment is produced by  xxxg1883xxx ,
and helps ameliorate nsaid damage in colonic tissue. clinically,
use of nsaids such as flunixin may increase colonic permeability,
which may in turn result in increased absorption of bacterial toxins
such as lps, and protein loss. this supposition is supported by the
significant increase in lps flux noted in equine colonic tissues
treated with flunixin.
the data on txb 2 levels in the present study were somewhat
unexpected, because this prostanoid has been used as a marker of
 xxxg1883xxx  activity in some tissues (stichtenoth et al.1997; cryer and
feldman 1998), including equine jejunum (campbell and

498

blikslager 2000). however,  xxxd2065xxx , a cox-2 inhibitor, inhibited
production of txb 2 to the same extent as the nonselective cox
inhibitor flunixin. these data can be interpreted in 2 ways: either
 xxxd2065xxx  is not selective enough for cox-2 to allow
discrimination between cox isoforms, or txb2 is also produced
by cox-2 in bile-injured colon. the latter may be true, since
studies have clearly shown elevations in txb2 in horses given i.v.
lps (henry et al. 1991), a potent stimulus for cox-2 upregulation. however, this would also mean that control tissues in
the present study had cox-2 activity, which may have been
induced by surgical manipulation or stripping in preparation for
mounting in ussing chambers, which may account for the
significant increase in txb 2 noted at the end of the study.
the decrease in ter in control tissues treated with  xxxd2065xxx  or
flunixin was not accompanied by any significant change in the
histological indices, suggesting changes in paracellular resistance
are responsible for decreases in ter. the paracellular space is
regulated by interepithelial tight junctions, which form a
continuous gate at the apical aspect of adjoining cells. the relative
permeability of tight junctions is tissue specific. in particular, the
small intestine has relatively ‘leaky’tight junctions, whereas those
in the colon are more tightly apposed (gitter et al. 2000). this
results in a higher baseline ter in colon compared to jejunum
(campbell and blikslager 2000). therefore, fairly minor damage
to tight junctions, which may have occurred in the present studies
in tissues treated with cox inhibitors, could result in relatively
large changes in ter. however, the significant increase in the
flux of 14c-labelled lps across the mucosa in flunixin-treated
control tissue suggests that these junctional changes are of clinical
significance, which could lead to lps absorption or protein loss.
in the present studies, we have shown that exposure of colonic
mucosa to 1.5 mmol/l  xxxd1835xxx  for 30 min leads to injury of
mucosa and the recovery from that injury is for the most part
independent of cox-elaborated prostanoids. in addition, we have
shown that nonselective cox inhibition in normal colonic
mucosa, with flunixin, leads to a marked increase in permeability.
cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibition, with  xxxd2065xxx , also triggered
increases in permeability, but to a lesser extent than nonselective
cox inhibition. this suggests  xxxd2065xxx  may have reduced side
effects in horses requiring nsaid therapy.
