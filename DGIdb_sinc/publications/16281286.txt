communicated by jan p. kraus
cobalamin nonresponsive methylmalonic acidemia (mma, mut complementation class) results from mutations
in the nuclear gene mut, which codes for the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl coa mutase (mcm). to
better elucidate the spectrum of mutations that cause mma, the mut gene was sequenced in 160 patients with
mut mma. sequence analysis identified mutations in 96% of disease alleles. mutations were found in all coding
exons, but predominantly in exons 2, 3, 6, and 11. a total of 116 different mutations, 68 of which were novel,
were identified. of the 116 different mutations, 53% were missense mutations, 22% were deletions,
duplications or insertions, 16% were nonsense mutations, and 9% were splice-site mutations. sixty-one of the
mutations have only been identified in one family. a novel mutation in exon 2, c.322c4t (p.r108c), was
identified in 16 of 27 hispanic patients. snp genotyping data demonstrated that hispanic patients with this
mutation share a common haplotype. three other mutations were seen exclusively in hispanic patients:
c.280g4a (p.g94r), c.1022dupa, and c.970g4a (p.a324t). seven mutations were seen almost exclusively
in black patients, including the previously reported c.2150g4t (p.g717v) mutation, which was identified
in 12 of 29 black patients. two mutations were seen only in asian patients. some frequently identified
mutations were not population-specific and were identified in patients of various ethnic backgrounds. some
of these mutations were found in mutation clusters in exons 2, 3, 6, and 11, suggesting a recurrent mutation.

introduction
methylmalonyl coa mutase (mcm,  xxxg1485xxx ) deficiency
secondary to mutations in the mut gene is responsible for the mut
complementation class of methylmalonic acidemia (mim]
251000). mcm catalyzes the isomerization of l-methylmalonyl
coa to succinyl coa, and adenosylcobalamin is a cofactor. this
reaction is part of the catabolic pathway of certain branched chain
amino acids, odd chain  xxxd2154xxx , and cholesterol through
propionyl coa to the tca cycle. the nuclear-encoded mcm
enzyme is transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where its 32
amino acid mitochondrial leader sequence is cleaved [jansen and
ledley, 1990]. the mature enzyme forms a homodimer with each
subunit 718 amino acids in size [thomä and leadlay, 1996].
the human mut gene maps to chromosome region 6p12-21.2
[ledley et al., 1988] and has 13 exons spanning over 35 kb of
genomic dna [nham et al., 1990]. the structure of mcm has
been studied extensively in propionibacterium shermanii [mancia
et al., 1996, 1999]. the mcm a-subunit of p. shermanii has high
amino acid sequence similarity (65%) with human mcm, and a
human mcm model has been derived from the crystal structure of
p. shermanii mcm [thomä and leadlay, 1996]. the mitochondrial
leader sequence (residues 1–32) is followed by the n-terminal
r 2005 wiley-liss, inc.

extended segment (residues 33–87), which is involved in subunit
interaction. the n-terminal (ba)8 barrel is the substrate binding
domain (residues 88–422) and is attached to the c-terminal (ba)5
domain (cobalamin binding domain, residues 578–750) by a long
linker region (residues 423–577).
mut mma is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder that commonly
presents in the first weeks or months of life with severe metabolic
acidosis. common clinical features include lethargy, vomiting,
failure to thrive, hypotonia, neurological deficit, and early death

human mutation 27(1), 31^43, 2006

[matsui et al., 1983; shevell et al., 1993]. two biochemical
phenotypes have been identified in patient fibroblasts with mut
mma. mut0 cells have very low or undetectable levels of mcm
activity. mut– cells have residual mcm activity that is increased
by the addition of  xxxd2300xxx  during cell culture, and some
of these cells have been shown to have a reduced affinity for
adenosylcobalamin [willard and rosenberg, 1977]. the diagnosis
of mut mma is confirmed by somatic cell complementation.
interallelic complementation between mut cell lines has been
observed [raff et al., 1991; qureshi et al., 1994], though the
reasons for this remain unclear.
to date, 103 disease-causing mutations in the human mut
gene have been reported [ledley and rosenblatt, 1997; heptinstall et al., 1999; mikami et al., 1999; cavicchi et al., 2001;
acquaviva et al., 2005; martı́nez et al., 2005; jung et al., 2005].
the same mutation has been identified in families not known to be
related, including p.g717v in black patients [adjalla et al.,
1998a], p.e117x in japanese patients [ogasawara et al., 1994],
c.655a4t (p.n219y) in caucasian patients [acquaviva et al.,
2001], and the c.671-678dup in spanish patients [martı́nez et al.,
2005]. the majority of other mutations have been identified in
only one family.
in this study of 160 patients with mut mma, we examined the
spectrum of mutations in the mut gene and identified 68 novel
mutations, recurrent mutations, mutation clusters, and population-specific mutations. in particular, a common mutation
(p.r108c) was identified in hispanic patients, and this mutation
was shown to be inherited on a common haplotype.
materials and methods
patients and controls
cell lines from 160 unrelated patients with mcm deficiency
were studied (tables 1–3). the cell lines were referred to the
 xxxd1771xxx  clinical research laboratory (division of medical
genetics, mcgill university). mutation analyses of 22 patients in
this series were reported previously, as indicated in tables 1 and 2.
all coding exons of the mut gene were sequenced in 48
anonymous controls. exon 2 was sequenced in 87 anonymous
controls, and exons 2 and 5 were also sequenced in 23 hispanic
controls. this study was approved by the research ethics board of
the royal victoria hospital, montreal, quebec, canada.
biochemical testing and somatic cell
complementation
all patient fibroblasts with mut mma had decreased incorporation of label from 1-[14c] propionate into cellular macromolecules
(control value: 1174 nmols/mg/18 hr). the synthesis of adocbl
from [57co] cncbl (control value 5 15.3%74.2% of total
cellular cobalamin) was normal or slightly reduced. the patients
were classified as either mut0 or mut– on the basis of the
incorporation of 1-[14c] propionate, with and without the
addition of  xxxd2300xxx  in the culture medium. mut
mma was confirmed by somatic cell complementation studies,
as described previously [watkins et al., 2000].
mutation detection
dna was extracted from patient fibroblasts using the qiagen
genomic-tip dna extraction kit for cultured cells (qiagen inc.,
chatsworth, ca). all mut coding exons (2–13), as well as their
adjacent intronic consensus splice sites, were amplified by pcr
and sequenced in all patients. the untranslated exon 1 and the 30
utr of exon 13 were amplified and sequenced in a subset of
human mutation doi 10.1002/humu

patients (40 and 20 patients, respectively), including all patients in
whom mutations in coding exons were not identified. all pcr
primers were designed using the primer3 electronic resource
program (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/genomesoftware/other/primer3.
html), except for the previously described exon 12 primers [peters
et al., 2002]. the primers used and the optimized pcr annealing
temperatures are listed in table 4.
pcr products were purified using multiscreen, 96-well pcr
clean-up plates (millipore, billerica, ma; www.millipore.com).
sequencing was done in 96-well plates in 10-ml sequencing
reactions consisting of 2 ml of pcr product, 0.5 ml of bigdye
terminator cycle sequencing version 3.1 (applied biosystems,
foster city, ca), 1.75 ml of 5  sequencing buffer, 5.25 ml of
water, and 0.5 ml of sense or anti-sense primer. all amplicons
were sequenced in one direction, and with the exception of
seven mutations (see below), all mutations were confirmed
by sequencing in both forward and reverse directions. products
were analyzed on an abi 3730 dna analyzer (applied
biosystems). files were processed using sequence analysis software
(pe applied biosystems) and were assembled and analyzed using
the phred/phrap/consed system [ewing et al., 1998; gordon
et al., 1998].
restriction endonuclease digests were performed for the seven
mut gene mutations that could not be confirmed by sequencing in
the reverse direction (table 5). six of these mutations resulted in
either the introduction or the loss of a naturally occurring restriction
site. one mutation (c.1617dela) was confirmed with the use of an
artificially created bstui restriction site. restriction endonucleases
were purchased from new england biolabs (ipswich, ma) and the
digestions were performed under the conditions recommended by
the manufacturer. restriction fragments were identified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide)
with ethidium bromide staining. restriction digest confirmed all
seven mutations, which were absent in controls.
the mutation nomenclature recommended by antonarakis and
the nomenclature working group [1998], and the cdna
reference sequence from genbank (m65131.1) were used in this
study. the genomic contig nt–007592.14 was used for the
genomic dna sequence. cdna numbering commences from the
atg start codon, where 11 is the a of the atg translation
initiation codon.
genotyping and haplotype analysis
the p.r108c mutation was identified in 60% of hispanic
patients and one turkish patient (wg2622). to study the origin of
this mutation, genotyping and haplotype analysis was undertaken
in the 160 patients with mut mma, 24 hispanic controls, two
turkish controls, and the unaffected sibling of wg2622
(c.2179c4t, p.r727x carrier).
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) dispersed throughout
an 11.8 mb region of the short arm of chromosome 6 were chosen
from the international hapmap project (www.hapmap.org/)
[international hapmap consortium, 2003] and confirmed using
dbsnp available through the national center for biotechnology
information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the university of
california–santa cruz (ucsc) genome bioinformatics july
2003 freeze (http://genome.ucsc.edu). six snps identified through
mut gene sequencing were also included (fig. 1). initially, 60
snps spanning 134 kb and flanking mut were genotyped. in this
134 kb region, the genotyping resolution was one snp every 3 kb.
following this initial genotyping, a panel of eight microsatellite
markers (d6s291, d6s1051, ds61549, d6s1280, d6s1960,

d6s1681, d6s1570, and d6s1543) were chosen from decode
genetics [kong et al., 2002] and genotyped with the abi 3730
dna analyzer. this extended the 134 kb region in a stepwise
fashion in both directions along the chromosome so that the
haplotypes could be defined. the initial boundaries of the
p.r108c shared haplotype were determined to be d6s1549 and
d6s1960. to increase the haplotype resolution, 72 snps (with a
minor allele frequency greater than 0.05) between these two
markers were selected from the international hapmap project,
resulting in a resolution of one marker every 33 kb over the
determined p.r108c haplotype region.
oligonucleotide primers for all snps were designed using
beckman coulter (fullerton, ca) autoprimer v1.02 (build 2;
www.autoprimer.com). the genomelab snpstream genotyping
system (beckman coulter), including the snpstream reagent
kit and snpware tag array plate, was used for genotyping.
geneamp pcr system 9700 (applied biosystems) was used
for pcr and extension reactions. three snps (rs3729619,
rs2501962, and c.912–138 c4t) that initially failed on the
multiplex system were successfully genotyped using the fluorescence polarization-single base extension (fp-sbe) method as
described at www.genomequebec.mcgill.ca/services/genotyping.

results and discussion
clinical phenotype
of the 160 patients with mut mma, 125 (78%) were classified
as mut0 and the remaining 35 (22%) as mut–. eighty-seven patients
were male, 64 were female, and the gender was not specified on
the referral data for nine patients. the main ethnic groups were
black (29/160), hispanic (27/160), and asian (12/160). there
were a larger number of non-hispanic caucasian patients (63/
160), though this group was of mixed ethnic background and
many patients were classified as white without a more specific
indication of ethnic origin.
clinical information was available for 89% (143/160) of the
patients. the most common clinical and biochemical features
described were methylmalonic aciduria, acute episodes of metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, vomiting, poor feeding, failure to
thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, and neurological abnormalities,
including developmental delay, seizures, and metabolic stroke.
other frequently reported features are pancytopenia, coma, and
renal insufficiency.

most of the patients with mut mma presented in the first 3
months of life (tables 1 and 2). for the 133 patients with data on
the age of onset, 85% developed symptoms before the end of the
first year of life. patients with a mut– phenotype were more likely to
present later than patients with mut0 phenotype, and eight of nine
patients who presented after 2 years of age had a mut– phenotype.
mutation analysis
tables 1–3 list all 160 patients and the mutations identified.
sequence analysis identified mutations in 96% (308/320) of the
disease alleles. two mutations were identified in 95% (152/160) of
the patients. only one mutation was identified in four patients,
and no mutations were identified in four further patients. overall,
116 different mutations were identified. sixty-eight of these
mutations were novel (tables 1 and 2). the mutation types were
missense mutations (64/116, 55%); deletions, duplications, and
insertions (23/116, 20%); nonsense mutations (19/116, 16%); and
splice-site mutations (10/116, 9%).
of the 116 different mutations identified, 61 were only
identified in one family. deletions, insertions, and splice-site
mutations were more likely to be family-specific than missense and
nonsense mutations.
mutations were found in all coding exons, although exons 2, 3,
6, and 11 harbored the most mutations. the majority of mutations
were located in one of the two main functional domains–the nterminal (ba)8 barrel (substrate binding domain) or the cterminal (ba)5 barrel (cobalamin binding domain). only two
mutations—c.52c4t (p.q18x) and c.91c4t (p.r31x)—were
identified in the mitochondrial leader sequence. the paucity of
mutations and the lack of evolutionary conservation in the
mitochondrial leader sequence suggest redundancy of this
sequence. only three mutations—c.257c4t (p.p86l),
c.260g4a (p.g87e), and c.141–142instttt—were identified
in the n-terminal extended segment. eighteen different mutations
were identified in the linker region, though most of these
mutations (10/16) result in premature truncation, and any
missense mutations tended to be at the beginning or the end of
the linker region. the one missense mutation that is situated in
the middle of the linker region—c.1553t4c (p.l518p)—affects
a highly conserved amino acid.
novel mutations
thirty-one of the 68 novel mutations were missense mutations.
none of these mutations were present in 96 control chromosomes.
most novel missense mutations (21/31) involved the n-terminal
(ba)8 barrel. the majority of novel missense mutations changed
the size, charge, or physical property of the amino acid. however, four novel mutations—c.433g4a (p.g145s), c.556a4g
(p.m186v), c.791c4t (p.h265y), and c.1048c4t (p.h350y)—
led to minor amino acid changes. these mutations all affect highly
conserved amino acids in the n-terminal (ba)8 barrel (supplementary fig. s1, available online at www.interscience.wiley.com/
jpages/1059-7794/suppmat) and none of these mutations were
identified in controls, which makes it very likely that they are
pathogenically significant.
most of the novel missense mutations (23/31) involved amino
acids that were conserved in all six species studied (homo sapiens,
mus musculus, caenorhabditis elegans, propionibacterium shermani,
mycobacterium tuberculosis, and escherichia coli; supplementary
fig. s1). eight of the missense mutations involved amino acids
that were conserved in some but not all species examined
(c.257c4t (p.p86l), c.842t4c (p.l281s), c.870g4a

39

(p.g291e), c.1276g4a (p.g426r), c.1697c4g (p.t566r),
c.1718t4c
(p.f573s),
c.1844c4g
(p.p615r),
and
c.1909g4a (p.g637r); supplementary fig. s1). these mutations are still likely to be pathogenically significant, since none
were identified in controls and all involved a change in either the
polarity or the size of the substituted amino acid.
seventeen novel small insertions, duplications, or deletions
were identified. fifteen of these resulted in a translational frame
shift and a subsequent premature stop codon. two mutations—
c.1166–1168delctt
(s389del)
and
c.1233–1235delcat
(i412del)—resulted in the deletion of an amino acid in the
substrate binding domain. eleven novel nonsense mutations were
also identified.
nine novel mutations that are predicted to affect splicing
were detected. eight of these involved the acceptor or donor
consensus splice-site sequences. the insertion mutation c.3851
3instaagggt is a duplication of the last 5 basepairs of exon 2,
and the 2 basepairs of the consensus donor splice site, and is
predicted to eradicate the usual exon 2 donor splice site (berkeley
drosophila genome project, splice site prediction by neural
network, www.fruitfly.org/seq–tools/splice.html).
homozygous mut mutations
fifty patients (31%) were homozygous for a mut mutation
(table 1). nine of these patients had documented parental
consanguinity, two were possibly consanguineous, and information
was incomplete for many other patients. the high incidence of
homozygous mutations is in part explained by ethnicity-specific
mutations, such as p.g717v and p.r108c. thirty-one different
mutations were seen in homozygous patients, and 23 of these have
been identified in other patients in this study or the literature. if
the patients with known consanguinity are excluded, there remain
only two homozygous patients without a recurrent or ethnicityspecific mutation (wg1431 and wg2516).
eight polymorphisms identified by sequencing the mut exons
and flanking introns were homozygous in all homozygous mut
patients, except for wg1606 (see below). the possibility of a
deletion of the second allele, although unlikely, cannot be
excluded without examination of parental genotypes, which were
not available.
cell line wg1606 was homozygous for the c.607g4a
(p.g203r) mutation and was heterozygous for most polymorphisms within and outside the gene. this was based on genotyping of
36 snps within a 134 kb region that incorporates the mcm gene.
this patient inherited the g203r mutation on two different
chromosomal backgrounds, which suggests that this mutation has
occurred at least twice in human history.
patients with one mut mutation
in four patients, only one mut mutation was identified
(table 2). no mutations were identified in the 30 and 50 utrs
(exons 1, 2, and 13) in these patients. the second mutation may
be located in other noncoding areas of the gene. this may be the
case for cell line wg2269, which was heterozygous for the
c.1351g4t (p.e451x) mutation and revealed two intronic
polymorphisms (c.1333-94dela and c.1333-18t4g) that were
not seen in any other patients or controls.
patients without any mut mutations
in four patients, no mutations were identified in the mut gene,
including the 30 and 50 utrs. the biochemical results for all four
patients were indicative of mutase deficiency, although they all
human mutation doi 10.1002/humu

40

human mutation 27(1), 31^43, 2006

had either atypical clinical or biochemical features (table 3). it is
likely that mutations are present in noncoding or regulatory
regions of the mut gene in these four patients. however, since
none of these patients had consanguineous parents, it is unusual
that neither mutation was identified. it is possible that a mutation
in another unidentified gene is responsible for the clinical
phenotype, or that the mut deficiency is part of a general
deficiency of mitochondrial enzyme function. however, the
biochemical and complementation data do not support the latter
suggestions.
ethnicity-speci¢c mutations
hispanic patients. there were 27 hispanic patients in this
study. four mutations (p.r108c, p.g94r, c.1022dupa, and
p.a324t) were significantly associated with hispanic ancestry,
and these mutations accounted for 65% of mutations in hispanic
patients (table 6). the p.r108c mutation was seen in 60% (16/
27) of hispanic patients.
the c.1846c4t (p.r616c) and c.671–678dup mutations were
identified in hispanic patients and one spanish patient. these two
mutations, as well as the p.a324t and c.1022dupa mutations,
were recently reported in patients from spain [martı́nez et al.,
2005]. our hispanic patients likely inherited these four mutations
from distant spanish ancestors. although the c.682c4t
(p.r228x) mutation was seen in five hispanic patients, it was
also found in six other patients of very varied background.
haplotype analysis revealed that the six hispanic patients
homozygous for the p.r108c mutation were also homozygous for
51 snps within and around the mut gene (fig. 1). they share an
overlapping haplotype of 1.71 mb gdna upon which the
mutation arose in the hispanic population. this haplotype was
distinct from haplotypes seen in other mut mma patients with
homozygous mutations. for each snp examined, all p.r108c
compound heterozygous hispanic patients shared at least one
allele in common with this p.r108c haplotype (supplementary
fig. s2). since the phase was not determined, it can only be
assumed that the alleles shared with the p.r108c haplotype all
reside on the same chromosome.
a haplotype analysis of the turkish patient (wg2622), who was
compound heterozygous for the p.r108c and p.r727x mutations,
revealed a different mutation history. the turkish patient had a
number of homozygous alleles that differed from that of the
hispanic p.r108c haplotype (fig. 1). phase was determined by
table 6.

ethnic group
hispanic (27 patients)

black (29 patients)

asian (12 patients)

haplotype analysis of the unaffected sibling of the turkish patient
(a p.r727x mutation carrier), and these data revealed a number of
additional haplotype differences from the hispanic p.r108c
haplotype. the p.r108c mutation in the turkish patient occurred
on a different chromosomal background from the hispanic
mutation, and was not inherited from a common ancestor. since
the p.r108c mutation involves a cpg dinucleotide, a known
mutation hotspot, this is the likely cause of the recurrent mutation
at this location.
black patients. there were 29 black patients (27 african
americans, one ghanan, and one nigerian) included in the study.
seven mutations were significantly associated with black ancestry
(table 6), and together these mutations accounted for 71% of
mutations in black patients. the p.g717v mutation was found in
41% of black patients, confirming the previous report that this
mutation is common in black patients [adjalla et al., 1998a]. this
mutation is associated with a mut– phenotype (table 1). one
italian patient (wg1827) was heterozygous for the p.g717v
mutation, and one homozygous p.g717v patient (wg2312) was
of unspecified ethnicity.
the nine patients who were homozygous for the p.g717v
mutation shared an overlapping haplotype of 0.75 mb gdna
(supplementary fig. s3). in comparison with other homozygous
mut mma patients, this haplotype was distinct. all patients who
were compound heterozygous for p.g717v shared at least one
allele for every snp with the g717v haplotype, suggesting that in
all cases the g717v mutation occurred on a common haplotype
(supplementary fig. s4).
asian patients. there were 12 asian patients in this study.
two sequence variations—c.1630–1631 delgginsta (p.g544x)
and c.1280g4a (p.g427d)—were seen only in asian patients
(table 6). the p.g544x mutation was described previously in a
thai patient [champattanachai et al., 2003]. the p.g427d
mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid in the linker
region; however, it was seen only in asian patients, and asian
controls were not specifically examined.
recurrent mutations and mutation hotspots
some of the mut mutations identified in more than one
patient are likely to be recurrent rather than inherited from a
common ancestor. there is evidence for recurrence of the
p.g203r mutation in wg1606 and the p.r108c mutation in
wg2622, as described above.

a number of mutations occurred in close proximity, in the same
or adjacent nucleotides, suggesting that these locations are
hotspots for mutational events (table 7). in many cases this is
explained by the presence of a cpg dinucleotide, a known
mutational hotspot. of the 83 point mutations that resulted in
nonsense or missense mutation, 18 involved a cpg dinucleotide,
as indicated in tables 1 and 2. the cpg dinucleotide located in
codon 108 was subject to three different mutations—c.322c4t
(p.r108c), c.322c4g (p.r108g), and c.323g4a (p.r108h)—
with evidence of recurrence for the p.r108c mutation. the
p.r369 codon also contains a cpg dinucleotide and was the site of
two mutations c.1105c4t (p.r369c) and c.1106g4a
(p.r369h) (table 7). many of the cpg dinucleotide mutations
were seen in individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. for
example, the p.r228x was seen in 10 patients of various
backgrounds, including mexican, vietnamese, non-hispanic
caucasian, and black, suggesting a recurrent mutation at this
location. the p.r369h mutation (11 patients), p.r152x mutation
(four patients), and p.r727x mutation (four patients) also involve
cpg dinucleotides and were also identified in patients of very
different ethnic backgrounds, strongly suggesting that at least
some of these mutations have occurred more than once in human
history. for other mutation clusters described in table 7, the
mechanism of mutation generation is unexplained.
controls
two mut mutations were identified in the control group. one

108 is important for substrate binding, the p.r108h mutation is
likely to be pathogenic.
phenotype/genotype correlations
it was difficult to correlate the clinical features with the
genotype because of the large number of compound heterozygous
patients in this study. only two mutations were seen frequently
enough in homozygous form (p.r108c and p.g717v) to attempt a
correlation with clinical features. all homozygous p.r108c
patients were mut0, and all homozygous p.g717v patients were
mut– . however, there were no distinctive clinical features that
correlated with these mutations. although patients with p.r108c
mutations were more likely to present in the newborn period than
patients with p.g717v mutations, clinical severity was variable in
both groups, and the p.g717v mutation may also be associated
with a severe phenotype.
patients with two protein truncating mutations would be
predicted to have a severe phenotype. the 21 patients with two
truncating mutations all had a mut0 phenotype. clinical information was available for 18 of these patients, and 78% had neonatal
onset. patients with two missense mutations (n 5 72) presented at
a wider range of ages, though neonatal presentations were still
common.
the mut– biochemical phenotype is known to be associated with
cobalamin binding domain mutations. in this study three
homozygous missense mutations in the c-terminal (ba)5
domain–p.g717v, p.l685r, and p.r616c–were associated with
a mut– phenotype (table 1). the c.2099t4a (p.m700k)
mutation involves an amino acid that is not highly conserved.
however, this mutation was identified in a mut– patient
(wg3369) whose propionate uptake increased remarkably with
the addition of  xxxd2300xxx , as would be expected with a cobalamin
binding domain missense mutation. m700k was also reported
previously in association with the mut– phenotype [acquaviva
et al., 2005].
wg1618 was classified as an ‘‘atypical’’ mut– cell line on the
basis of a higher propionate uptake than usual (table 2) and a late
clinical presentation at 4 years of age [shapira et al., 1991]. the
mutations identified were c.791c4t (p.h265y) and c.1276g4a
(p.g426r). the p.h265y mutation affects a highly conserved
amino acid in the substrate binding domain, but both amino acids
are of similar size and charge. the p.g426r mutation is located in
the functionally less important linker region. these mutations may
be less detrimental to enzyme function, which would explain the
milder biochemical and clinical phenotype in this patient.
interallelic complementation
nineteen (19/160) cell lines demonstrated interallelic complementation; however, this figure does not reflect the true incidence

of this phenomenon, since each cell line underwent somatic
cell complementation studies with only a few randomly selected
mut cell lines.
the cell line wg1130 (c.278g4a, p.r93h homozygote), as
previously reported, shows interallelic complementation with
many mut– cell lines and some mut0 cell lines [raff et al., 1991,
qureshi et al., 1994]. wg1130 complements cell lines with
missense mutations in the cobalamin binding domain:
c.1867g4a (p.g623r), c.1889g4a (p.g630e), c.2033a4g
(p.h678r), c.2107g4c (p.g703r), and p.g717v. however, in
this study it did not complement cell line wg1958, which is
homozygous for c.2054t4g (p.l685r). wg1130 did not
complement any cell lines with substrate binding mutations, with
one exception: cell line wg1601. why these two cell lines
complemented each other is unclear.
cell lines with missense mutations in the linker region
(p.c560y, p.g426r, and p.l518p) were more likely to show
interallelic complementation. a number of cell lines showed
complementation for no clear reason, based on the mutation types
or mutation location. the factors that influence interallelic
complementation are complex, possibly multifactorial, and require
further study.
polymorphisms
five common polymorphisms were identified in coding exons of
the mut gene, and these are listed in table 8. one rare sequence
variant, c.205a4g, p.i69v, was seen in heterozygous form in one
cell line, wg2202, and was assessed to be a polymorphism, since
two other mutations (p.r369h and c.656dela) were identified
in this patient.
an intronic polymorphism (c754 –7dupt) that leads to an
insertion of an extra t in a polyt stretch was identified in four
patients: wg3071, wg2983, wg2691, and wg2873. all were
hispanic patients with the c.1022dupa mutation, suggesting that
these two sequence variations occur on the same chromosome.
summary
mut gene mutations were found in 95% of patients with mut
mma. sixty-eight mutations were novel, yielding a total of 171
different mutations now reported in the mut gene. the majority
of mutations involved one of the two important functional
domains (the substrate binding domain or the cobalamin binding
domain). most mutations were identified in a single family, and
mutations were found in all coding exons, which made mutation
identification in an individual family a difficult task. however,
mutations specific to particular ethnic groups were identified in
patients with black, hispanic, or asian ancestry. in hispanic
patients, four mutations accounted for 65% of mutations. in black
patients, seven mutations accounted for more than 70% of
mutations. these findings allow directed mutational analyses to be
performed in these particular ethnic groups.
the p.r108c mutation is a novel mutation that was identified
in 60% of the hispanic patients. this mutation was shown to
be inherited on a common haplotype spanning 1.71 mb gdna.
the exact age of the hispanic p.r108c mutation cannot be
determined. however, the large size of the shared haplotype
suggests a relatively recent mutation. the p.g717v mutation,
which is common in black mut mma patients, is also shown to be
inherited on a common haplotype that is 0.75 mb gdna in size.
the smaller size of the common haplotype suggests that the
p.g717v mutation is older than the p.r108c mutation seen
in hispanics.
human mutation doi 10.1002/humu

the 32 novel missense mutations identified are thought to be
pathogenic based on the amino acid conservation patterns,
mutation location, and absence in controls. expression studies to
confirm pathogenicity were not undertaken, due to the large
number of mutations identified, but would provide valuable
confirmation of these mutations in individual cases.
in eight patients, one or no mutations were identified. in these
cases, the unidentified mutation or mutations may be located
within a regulatory region or within noncoding areas of the mut
gene. overall, however, the sequence mutation analysis of the
mut gene identified a high proportion of disease-causing
mutations in mut methylmalonic acidemia.
