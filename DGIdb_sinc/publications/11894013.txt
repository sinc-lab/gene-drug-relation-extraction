therapeutic potential of  xxxd2838xxx : a fully human
anti- xxxg682xxx  monoclonal
antibody for cancer treatment
david h. lynch and xiao-dong yang
overexpression of the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) has been observed in a wide variety of
human cancers and is associated with a poor clinical
prognosis. in many cases, growth of the tumor cells is
dependent on egfr-mediated signals, because inhibition of binding of factors to the egfr leads to cell
death. using xenomouse technology, a fully human
egfr-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody,  xxxd2838xxx , with
high afﬁnity (5 x 10ⴚ11 mol/l) has been generated.
 xxxd2838xxx  blocks binding of both epidermal growth
factor and transforming growth factor alpha to the
egfr, inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the egfr,
and inhibits cellular proliferation. in vivo,  xxxd2838xxx 
not only blocks formation of human epidermoid carcinoma a431 xenografts in athymic mice, but also mediates therapeutic elimination of established tumors
and acts cooperatively with chemotherapeutics in mediating tumor regression. these observations provide a
strong basis for the development of  xxxd2838xxx  as a
therapeutic agent for human solid tumors that overexpress egfr.

tudies in recent years have shown that epithelial cancers of a variety of different tumor
types overexpress cell surface receptors for the  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) (table 1).
binding of either  xxxg681xxx  (egf)
or transforming growth factor alpha- (tgf-␣) to
the egfr leads to cellular proliferation. interference with binding of these two growth factors to
the egfr may lead to arrest of cell proliferation.
an efficient mechanism of inhibiting the binding
of egf and tgf-␣ to the egfr is through the use
of monoclonal antibodies (mabs). a major limitation to this approach is that mouse antibodies
specific for the egfr are potentially immunogenic
when administered to humans.
efforts in recent years from a number of laboratories have sought to minimize this potential by
the creation of chimeric or humanized mabs.
with chimeric mabs, the variable regions of the
mouse antibodies are transferred onto a scaffold of
a human immunoglobulin. this leads to a protein
structure that is only about 34% mouse origin and
is still potentially immunogenic. a second approach has been to create humanized versions of
antibodies. in this situation, the specific comple-

mentarity-determining regions of the variable regions of both heavy and light chains are transferred onto a  xxxd2207xxx  scaffold. this results in
an immunoglobulin that is approximately 5% to
10% mouse origin, but still has the potential of
eliciting human antimouse antibody responses.
most recently, however, the capability to make
fully human antibodies has been developed using
the xenomouse (abgenix, fremont, ca) technology. this has been made possible by the creation of mice in which the mouse antibody genes
have been inactivated and replaced by genes encoding human antibodies.1
generation of a fully human mab specific for
the human egfr was accomplished by immunization of xenomouse igg2 strain mice with human tumor cells that overexpress the egfr (a431
cells). a panel of over 70 egfr-specific antibodies was generated. of the 38 antibodies that were
screened, 15 were found to have neutralizing activity. from this panel of antibodies, the xeno mouse
egfr-specific mab ( xxxd2838xxx ) was selected.2
this mab is a human igg2 kappa with very high
affinity for the egfr (kd ⫽ 5 x 10–11 mol/l) and
is egfr-specific. in vitro studies show that addition of  xxxd2838xxx  to cultures of a431 cells stimulated by egf effectively inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the egfr in a dose-dependent
manner (fig 1). this effect appears to be mediated
not only by blockade of the egf binding site on
the receptor, but also by rapid internalization of
the egfrs. functional studies have shown that
the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of egf
binding to a431 cells by  xxxd2838xxx  is approximately 3 nmol/l, which is substantially lower than

to inhibition of a431 cell growth in vitro, with

tgf-␣– dependent tumor cell proliferation in
vitro led us to design experiments to test whether
 xxxd2838xxx  could eliminate established tumors in
vivo in the absence of additional therapeutic interventions. in an initial experiment, a431 human tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into
mice and allowed to establish. beginning on day 7,
groups of mice were treated with either  xxxd2838xxx 
or a human myeloma igg2 control, twice per week
for 3 weeks. complete eradication of tumors was
observed in mice treated with  xxxd2838xxx  (fig 2),
whereas tumors in mice treated with the control

 xxxd2207xxx  grew at a rate that was indistinguishable from mice treated with the vehicle control.3
in a second experiment, mice were injected
with a431 tumor cells and treatment with abxegf when tumors reached 0.13 cm3, 0.56 cm3,
0.73 cm3, or 1.2 cm3 (days 7, 11, 15, or 22 after
tumor implantation, respectively). all mice, except for the control group, received 1 mg of abxegf by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly for
3 weeks. in all cases, monotherapy with  xxxd2838xxx 
completely eradicated the established a431 tumor
xenografts (fig 3).3 additional studies have shown
that the antitumor effect of  xxxd2838xxx  is critically
dependent on its ability to neutralize binding of
egf and tgf-␣ to the egfr. there was no

treated with egfr-specific mabs that do not neutralize egfr.2 of note, there is a clear cooperative
activity of treatment that has been observed with
 xxxd2838xxx  and chemotherapeutic agents such as
cisplatin and doxorubicin in mediating tumor rejection. treatment of tumor-bearing mice with
suboptimal concentrations of  xxxd2838xxx  and optimal doses of either of these chemotherapeutics is
more efficacious than treatment with either agent
alone (fig 4).
finally, there appears to be a relationship between the level of egfr expression on tumor cells
and their ability to be affected by treatment with
 xxxd2838xxx  in vivo. the data presented in table 2
represents a summary of experiments evaluating
the ability of  xxxd2838xxx  to affect the growth of
different human tumor xenografts in nude mice.
the results of these studies indicate that there is
little or no therapeutic benefit seen in situations

where the tumors express less than 11,000 receptors per cell. in contrast, inhibition of tumor
growth was seen in those settings in which the test
tumors expressed ⱖ 17,000 receptors per cell.2
in conclusion, these data show that  xxxd2838xxx ,
a fully human mab specific for the human egfr,
not only prevents solid tumor formation in human
tumor xenograft models but also can eradicate
large, established tumors. data also indicate that
 xxxd2838xxx  is capable of inhibiting growth of multiple different human tumors, in human tumor
xenografts in nude mice, and has no effect on
tumors that do not express the egfr. the ability
of  xxxd2838xxx  to inhibit tumor growth in vivo is
dependent upon its ability to block egfr binding
sites and to inhibit egfr-mediated signaling. in
addition,  xxxd2838xxx  is capable of acting as an
effective antitumor therapeutic, not only as monotherapy but also in cooperation with conventional
chemotherapeutic strategies. these observations
provide a strong basis for the development of
 xxxd2838xxx  as a therapy for cancer in humans.
