summary schizophrenia (sz), a common severe mental disorder, affecting about 1% of the world population.
however, the etiology of sz is still largely unknown. it is believed that molecules that are in an association with the
etiology and pathology of sz are neurotransmitters including dopamine, 5-ht and gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba).
but several lines of evidences indicate that potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, known as bk
channel, is likely to be included.  xxxg1259xxx  belongs to a group of ion channels that plays an important role in
regulating neuronal excitability and transmitter releasing. its involvement in sz emerges as a great interest. for
example, commonly used neuroleptics, in clinical therapeutic concentrations, alter calcium-activated potassium
conductance in central neurons.  xxxd1868xxx , a  xxxg1232xxx  opener/activator, showed a significant superiority
over haloperidol alone in the treatment of positive and general psychopathology symptoms in sz. additionally,
estrogen, which regulates the activity of  xxxg1259xxx , modulates dopaminergic  xxxg656xxx  and has an antipsychoticlike effect. therefore, we hypothesize that  xxxg1259xxx  may play a role in sz and those agents, which can target either
 xxxg1259xxx  functions or its expression may contribute to the therapeutic actions of sz treatment.

schizophrenia (sz) is a common severe mental disorder, affecting about 1% of the world population.
people who develop schizophrenia experience severe suffering and approximately 10% commit suicide. the causes of schizophrenia are still largely
unknown, although neurotransmitters might be of
the key importance in the molecular background
of sz. in 1952, delay and deniker reported the

sis [1]. this initiated an important advance in the
treatment of schizophrenia without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the drugâ€™s
therapeutic effect. in 1963, carlsson first postulated that the effects of neuroleptics were secondary to dopamine receptor blockade [2]. recently, a
modified dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has
been introduced. it suggests some sz have a hypodopaminergic state in the prefrontal cortex,
resulting in negative symptoms [3], and hyperdopaminergia in the mesolimbic system and striatum,
resulting in positive symptoms [4]. in clinical study,
the antipsychotic effects take days to achieve, suggesting that the initial blockade of dopamine

receptors eventually leads to secondary changes
that ameliorates the symptoms [5]. current
theories on these secondary changes include electrophysiological adaptations, such as a depolarization of dopamine neurons, changes in gene
expression of dopaminergic and dopaminoceptive
neurons, and channel regulation [6].
several lines of evidences indicate that potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, known as  xxxg1259xxx  [7] is likely to be a
novel target for treatment of sz.  xxxg1259xxx 
(fig. 1a) belongs to a group of ion channels that
plays an important role in regulating neuronal
excitability and transmitter releasing [8]. its
involvement in sz emerges as a great interest
[9,10]. association of abnormality of potassium
channels in the brain with sz has been domonstrated. for example, commonly used neuroleptics, in clinical therapeutic concentrations, alter
calcium-activated potassium conductance in central neurons [11]. the effect of neuroleptics on calcium-activated potassium channels was observed in
dog airway smooth muscle cells [12]. these agents
inhibit not only a variety of other ca2+-mediated
processes, but also ca2+-activated k+ channels
[12]. neuroleptics may bind to and block the open
channel [12]. several neuroleptics inhibit the k+
channel from the internal but not the external surface of the patch [12]. inhibition by neuroleptics is
moderately voltage dependent, with blockers less
potent at hyperpolarizing voltages. the binding
site is at one-third the way across the channelâ€™s
electrical field. equilibrium dissociation constants
(kds) for the drug-channel complex are 1.0 Â± 0.1
mm for haloperidol; and 2.0 mm for chlorpromazine. this rank-order potency is different from
their potency as calmodulin inhibitors, which suggests that neuroleptics bind to the channel rather
than a calmodulin-channel complex [12]. like
other voltage dependent ion channels,  xxxg1259xxx 
is similar to the fast-domain, shutter-like receptors, except that it is opened by voltage potentials
across the cell membrane. it may affect transmitting signals along nerve fibers, or release its neurotransmitter at the end of an axonal terminal.
in a clinical study,  xxxd1868xxx , a benzothiadiazine
derivative related to the thiazide diuretics and a
 xxxg1232xxx  opener, was used for treatment
of sz [13]. forty-two patients who met the dsm iv
criteria for chronic schizophrenia were randomized
to haloperidol 20 mg/day plus  xxxd1868xxx  200 mg/
day (n = 21) or to haloperidol 20 mg/day plus placebo (n = 21) in this 8-week double-blind study. it
is found that combination of haloperidol and  xxxd1868xxx  showed a significant superiority over haloperidol alone in the treatment of positive and general

each channel complex is thought to be composed of 2
types of subunits: the pore-forming (a) subunits and
smaller accessory (b) subunits. that are b-subunit coupling, voltage and calcium sensing, k+ pore and tail

the study concluded that,  xxxg1232xxx  openers/activators,  xxxd1868xxx  could be an effective
adjuvant agent in the treatment of schizophrenia
[13]. in addition, the other group of data also sup-

ports the hypothesis about roles of bk channels in
sz. in those studies, it has been demonstrated that,
estrogen, which regulate the activity of  xxxg1259xxx ,
modulate dopaminergic  xxxg656xxx  and has an
antipsychotic-like effect [15,16].
finally, in our human postmortem brain study, a
direct evidence of abnormality of  xxxg1259xxx  in sz
brains was obtained. we have examined the
expression of  xxxg1259xxx  mrna in postmortem prefrontal cortex (pfc) of patients with sz disorders
and non-psychiatric controls by in situ hybridization. all groups had been matched for age, race,
gender, brain ph levels and postmortem time intervals. we found that  xxxg1259xxx  mrna levels in the
prefrontal cortex were lower in schizophrenia (pfc,
fig. 1b) than in control. in detail,  xxxg1259xxx  mrna
levels were significantly lower in laminas 1, 2, 3,
and 6, also in region ba 9 of sz groups comparing
with those of the control (fig. 1 aâ€“c).

conclusion
the significances of this hypothesis lie in two aspects: first, from a clinical perspective, it provides
a novel potential therapeutic target for those currently used  xxxg1259xxx  regulators; second, from an
etiological and pathological perspective, this
hypothesis provide a possibility to address the issue
of an association between k+ (bk) channel and sz.
