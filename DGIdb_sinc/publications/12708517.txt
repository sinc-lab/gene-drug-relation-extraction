discriminative stimulus properties of (+/-)-fenfluramine: the role of  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes.  the role of serotonin 5-ht2 receptors (5-ht2r) in the discriminative stimulus effects of fenfluramine was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were trained to discriminate (+/-)-fenfluramine (2 mg/kg ip) from saline using a 2-lever, water-reinforced paradigm. drug-lever responding after fenfluramine was dose-dependent. the 5-ht(2c/1b)r agonist mcpp and the 5-ht(2c)r agonist mk 212 fully substituted, whereas the 5-ht(2a/2c)r agonist doi partially substituted, for the training drug. the  xxxg1114xxx r agonist bw 723c86 engendered saline-lever responding. the 5-ht(2c/2b)r antagonist sb 206553 completely antagonized the fenfluramine discrimination a well as the full substitutions of mcpp and mk 212 and the partial substitution of doi. the selective 5-ht(2a)r antagonist m100907 partially suppressed the stimulus effects of fenfluramine, mcpp, and mk 212 and almost fully attenuated the partial substitution of doi. rs 102221, a selective 5-ht(2c)r antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, did not alter the fenfluramine cue. results demonstrate that the discriminative stimulus effects of fenfluramine are centrally mediated by 5-ht(2c)r and to some extent by 5-ht(2a)r.
