abstract
a cdna clone similar to human  xxxg2043xxx  (sdh) is deposited in the genbank/embl databases, but its structural and functional
bases remain unknown. despite the occurrence of mrna, the expected protein level was found to be low in cultured cells. to learn about
physicochemical properties of the protein, we expressed the cdna in escherichia coli, and compared the expressed protein with that of a hepatic
sdh. the purified protein showed l-serine and  xxxd3361xxx  dehydratase activity, demonstrating to be an isoform of sdh. however, their km and
vmax constants were different in a range of two-order. removal of pro128 from the hepatic sdh consisting of 328 residues, which is missing in
the corresponding position of the isoform consisting of 329 residues, significantly changed the michaelis constants and kd value for pyridoxal 5′phosphate, whereas addition of a proline residue to the isoform was without effect. these findings suggest the difference in the structures of the
active sites of the two enzymes. another striking feature was that the expressed level of the isoform in e. coli was 7-fold lower than that of the
hepatic sdh. substitution of val for leu287 in the isoform dramatically increased the protein level. the high yield of the mutated isoform was
also confirmed by the in vitro transcription and translation experiment. the poor expression of the isoform could be explained by the more stable
secondary structure of the mrna than that of the hepatic sdh mrna. the present findings may provide a clue as to why the protein level in
cultured cells is low.

1. introduction
 xxxg2043xxx  (sdh,  xxxg1016xxx .17; formerly 4.3.1.13)
catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent conversion of
l-serine ( xxxd3361xxx ) to pyruvate (alpha-ketobutyrate) and ammonia. this enzyme is widely distributed in organisms including
bacteria, yeast, plants and vertebrates (ref. [1] for review).
microbial and plant sdhs are allosteric enzymes consisting

962

h. ogawa et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1764 (2006) 961–971

of a homotetramer and are involved in the biosynthesis of
 xxxd2394xxx , for which the alpha-ketobutyrate produced from lthreonine is used as starting material. the crystal structure
of e. coli sdh was solved previously [2]. rat liver sdh is a
michaelis type enzyme consisting of a homodimer [3–5] and
participates in gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney [6]. the
crystal structures of rat and human sdhs were also reported
recently, and show that they have similar tertiary structures, as
would be expected since they have 84.1% identity of the amino
acid sequences [7–9]. on the other hand, the overall amino acid
sequence identity between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic sdhs
is very low (25%), but their folding patterns are substantially
similar [2,7,8].
except in rodents, the levels of sdh are generally low in
vertebrate livers so far examined. for example, the level of sdh
in human liver is estimated to be ten times lower than that in rat
liver [10,11]. moreover, human sdh is localized in the
perivenous hepatocytes, whereas rat sdh exists predominantly
in the periportal hepatocytes, where gluconeogenesis and
ureogenesis are the most active [12–14]. the ichiyama group
demonstrated that in the human liver, serine-pyruvate aminotransferase ( xxxg102xxx ), rather than sdh, plays a pivotal role
in serine catabolism [15]. several lines of evidence, therefore,
led us to suppose that mammalian sdhs, except for rodent
sdhs, play a limited role in gluconeogenesis and may have
another function [1,9]. recently, we noticed that a novel mrna
similar to sdh was deposited as “sdh-like 1” in the databases.
its cdnas were obtained from human cell lines such as lung,
kidney and brain cancer cells, and from normal organs. the
nucleotide and amino acid sequences are 36.4% and 58.8%
identical, respectively, between the sdh-like 1 and the
authentic sdh. in this study, the sdh-like 1 was designated
 xxxg2044xxx  (cancerous sdh), and the authentic one hsdh (hepatic
sdh). as a first step to clarify the biological functions of this
new gene and its product, we attempted to explore the
physicochemical properties of purified  xxxg2044xxx . in a preliminary
experiment, neither sdh activity nor an appreciable amount of
 xxxg2044xxx  as determined by western blotting was detected in lung
cancer cell lysates. therefore, we decided to characterize a
recombinant  xxxg2044xxx .  xxxg2044xxx  was expressed in e. coli and purified
 xxxg2044xxx  was found to possess sdh activity, and was therefore
judged to be an isoform of sdh. in the course of this study, we
found that the expression level of  xxxg2044xxx  was extremely low
relative to that of hsdh in e. coli. since rat sdh and hsdh are
abundantly expressed in e. coli, the low-level expression of
 xxxg2044xxx  profoundly intrigued us. this paper characterizes
recombinant  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh, and clarifies a mechanism for
why  xxxg2044xxx  is so poorly expressed in e. coli.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
reagents used in this study were purchased as follows: rt-pcr kit, takara,
japan; quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit, stratagene; ecl western
blotting kit, amersham; de52, whatman; sephacryl s-200, pharmacia; ni2+nta, gibco brl; pet-28a(+) dna, novagen; in vitro transcription and
translation kit (easyxpress) and qirprep spin miniprep kit, qiagen. non-small

lung cancer cells, h226,  xxxd1322xxx  and h441 were purchased from atcc, and pc14,
a549 and sq5 were from riken (japan).

2.2. detection of hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  mrnas in cancer cells
total rna was isolated from human lung cancer cells by the acid
guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method [16]. cdna was synthesized by reverse transcriptase using a random hexamer primer. then, an
aliquot thereof was amplified by taq dna polymerase with the following
primers: 5′-gcagagcatgccaagca-3′ (forward) and 5′-cttggcmacactggtga-3′ (reverse) for hsdh, and 5′-gcagagcatgccaagca-3′
(forward) and 5′-cttggcmacactggtga-3′ (reverse) for  xxxg2044xxx , respectively. the forward and reverse primers corresponded to the sequences
slightly downstream from the translation start codon, and about 660
nucleotides downstream from the translation start site, respectively. the
reverse primer was common to both dnas. the conditions for pcr were: 25
cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °c, 1-min annealing at 57 °c and 1-min
elongation at 72 °c.

2.3. cloning of a full-length  xxxg2044xxx  from lung cancer cells and
construction of expression vector
a first strand cdna for  xxxg2044xxx  was synthesized as above and amplified by
taq dna polymerase with the primers of 5′-tcccatatggatggtcctgtggcagagc-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgctcatctagaaccaggactgtcc-3′
(reverse), where the underlined and double underlined sequences correspond to
ndei and xbai sites, respectively. the conditions for pcr were: two cycles of
94 °c for 1 min, 45 °c for 1 min, 72 °c for 1.5 min, followed by 30 cycles
of 94 °c for 1 min, 55 °c for 1 min, 72 °c for 1.5 min. the procedure for
constructing the expression vector with pcw was described previously [17].
briefly, an aliquot of the pcr product was digested with ndei and xbai, and
ligated with the pcw vector that had been cut with ndei and xbai.
ampicillin-resistant colonies of e. coli bl21(de3) transformed with this
recombinant dna were obtained. alternatively, an ndei and hindiii fragment
from the pcw recombinant vector was introduced into the pet28(a) vector
precut with ndei and hindiii. kanamycin-resistant colonies of e. coli bl21
(de3) were selected. construction of the pcw plasmid expressing hsdh was
described previously [9]: an insert cut out from the vector with ndei and
hindiii was ligated with the pet28(a) precut with ndei and hindiii.

2.4. bacterial growth
for analytical experiments, 10 ml of lb medium containing 1/50 volume of
overnight culture of recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) was shaken at 37 °c for
2 h and then supplemented with 0.5 mm iptg. the culture was continued for an
additional 15 h at 25 °c or 3 h at 37 °c. the cells were harvested in a 15-ml
plastic tube by centrifugation and suspended with 1 ml of 10 mm tris–hcl (ph
8.0)/1 mm edta/lysozyme (1 mg), and frozen for 30 min at −80 °c. after
thawing, the suspension was subjected to brief sonication. one or 2 mul of the
lysate (about 7.0 mg protein/ml) was used for western blotting or sds-page,
respectively.

2.5. purification of recombinant  xxxg2044xxx 
for purification of recombinant  xxxg2044xxx , a 2-l sakaguchi flask containing
500 ml of lb medium was shaken with overnight culture of recombinant e.
coli bl21 (de3) in the same manner as above. the incubation time was
15 h at 25 °c after iptg induction. the cells were collected into four 50ml tubes by centrifugation, suspended with 20 ml per tube of 10 mm tris–
hcl (ph 8.0)/1 mm edta/lysozyme (10 mg), and frozen at −80 °c until
use.  xxxg2044xxx  was purified according to the protocol described previously [9].
the sephacryl s-200 column-purified preparation was further applied to a
ni2+-nat column (1 cm diameter × 1.5 cm height) according to the
manufacturer's instruction manual. the final preparation eluted by 0.1 m
imidazole was immediately dialyzed against 10 mm tris–hcl (ph 8.0)/
0.05 mm plp/1 mm dithiothreitol/0.1 m kcl and frozen at −80 °c until
use.

2.6. enzyme assay and kinetics
the sdh activity was measured colorimetrically as described previously [18].
the reaction mixture (250 mul) consisted of 50 mm borate–koh (ph 8.3)/0.1 mm
plp/0.1 m l-serine and enzyme. one unit of enzyme activity is defined as the
amount that produces one nmol of product per min per mg protein at 37 °c. enzyme
kinetics was performed twice using two different homogenous preparations. each
plot was obtained by averaging the duplicate data and fitted to the least square
regression method. the km and vmax values were the mean values of two assays.

2.7. limited proteolysis experiment
one mug of purified  xxxg2044xxx  or hsdh was reacted with 1 ng of trypsin or
subtilisin, or 10 ng of chymotrypsin in 15 mul of 20 mm tris–hcl (ph 8.0) at
25 °c for 30 min. the reaction was terminated by adding an equal amount of
the sds buffer (4% sds/0.25 m tris–hcl (ph 6.8)) and the whole reaction
mixture was subjected to sds-page.

2.8. determination of apparent dissociation constant of apoenzyme for
plp
the apoenzyme was obtained by dialyzing the holoenzyme against 50 mm
potassium phosphate (ph 6.5)/10 mm l-cysteine at 0 °c overnight, and then
against 50 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.2)/1 mm dithiothreitol. the apparent
dissociation constant for the apoenzyme was obtained by measuring the enzyme
activity in the presence of varying concentrations of plp, 50 mm borate–koh
(ph 8.3) and 100 mm l-serine.

34,625), respectively (fig. 1a). they are 58.8 and 36.4%
homologous at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels,
respectively. the amino acid sequence homology is much lower
than the 84.1% sequence homology between human and rat
liver sdhs. the most striking feature we noted was that the nterminal seven amino acids of  xxxg2044xxx  and the c-terminal five
amino acids of hsdh are protruding with respect to the other
protein. without this difference, the amino acid identity
increases to 59.9%. another feature is that pro128 in hsdh
(marked by an open triangle) is missing in  xxxg2044xxx . except for
these differences, the sequence around the lysine residue
capable of forming a schiff base with plp (marked by a filled
triangle), and the glycine-rich sequence involved in the binding
of the phosphate moiety of plp (marked by an underline) are
well conserved, implying that  xxxg2044xxx  probably possesses the
sdh activity. we also found that the genes for these sdhs are
mapped in a reverse orientation at chromosome 12q24.13 and
are flanked by an about 18.5 kbp-long spacer. the gene
organizations are shown in fig. 1b. the translatable regions of
 xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh are composed of eight exons, which have the
same sizes in the two genes (also see fig. 1a), although the
length of the introns is different.
3.2. confirmation of sdh isoform mrna in lung cancer cells

2.9. site-directed mutagenesis by pcr
pcr-based site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the
manufacturer's instruction manual with slight modifications. the standard
reaction mixture and annealing temperature were changed to 25 mul and 50 °c,
respectively. the pcr product, after its presence was confirmed by agarose gel
electrophoresis, was treated with 0.5 mul of restriction enzyme dpni at 37 °c for
3 h, and a portion thereof was used for transformation of e. coli bl21 (de3).
plasmid dna from the transformant was purified using a qiagen mini-prep kit.
the nucleotide sequence analysis was conducted by the sanger method using an
abi 3100 dna sequencer.

2.10. in vitro transcription and translation experiments
the transcription and translation reaction mixture (25 mul) consisted of 8 mul of
e. coli extract, 10 mul of substrate buffer, 0.5 mug of template dna, 1 mm iptg,
plus protease inhibitors, and was incubated at 37 °c for 50 min. the reaction was
stopped by chilling at 0 °c, and 1 or 2 mul aliquots thereof were immediately
subjected to western blotting, or sds-page, respectively. the addition of iptg
was found to enhance the transcription.

2.11. other methods
protein was determined by the lowry method with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
a standard [19]. sds-page (13.5%) was carried out by the method of laemmli
[20]. coomassie brilliant blue solution consisted of 40% methanol/10% acetic
acid/0.25% dye. western blotting was performed with an ecl kit according to
the manufacturer's instruction manual, with the anti-rabbit igg against rat sdh
was used as the first antibody [13].

3. results
3.1. comparison of the amino acid sequences between  xxxg2044xxx 
and hsdh, and gene organization
we first aligned the amino acid sequences of  xxxg2044xxx  and
hsdh, which consist of 329 (mr 34,673) and 328 residues (mr

the genbank/embl database contained cdnas for  xxxg2044xxx 
(as sdh-similar mrna) from various cancer cell lines and
normal organs. to confirm the presence of the  xxxg2044xxx  mrna,
we carried out rt-pcr using total rna from five kinds of
human lung cancer cell lines. as shown in fig. 2 (upper and
middle panels), positive signals for  xxxg2044xxx  mrna were found in
all of the cell lines examined, while hsdh mrna was low or
undetectable in four of the lines. sequence analysis showed that
the full-length cdna obtained here was the same as the
authentic  xxxg2044xxx . to assess the occurrence of  xxxg2044xxx  protein,
western blot analysis using the mono-specific rabbit igg to rat
liver sdh was done for the cell lysates from the cells that
expressed only  xxxg2044xxx  mrna. contrary to our initial expectation, no appreciable band was seen in each case, whereas the
purified rat liver and rat liver extract preparations cross-reacted
with the igg (fig. 2, lower panel). (that  xxxg2044xxx  cross-reacts well
with the igg used here is examined in fig. 3). these results
indicate extremely low or negligible levels of  xxxg2044xxx  despite the
presence of the mrna. therefore, we decided to produce a
recombinant protein for further study.
3.3. bacterial expression and purification of sdhs
in a previous study, we succeeded in a large production of
hsdh in e. coli using the pcw expression vector [9]. a merit of
this vector is its capability of producing sdh carrying no
artificial sequence, and thus, the recombinant protein is useful
for crystallography. unexpectedly, an iptg-induced  xxxg2044xxx 
protein band was not clearly seen in crude extracts of e. coli
upon sds-page under the conditions in which an hsdh band
was clearly recognized. changes of culture conditions such as
incubation temperature and duration were without effect. this

fig. 1. amino acid sequences of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh, and gene organization. (a) the amino acid sequence of  xxxg2044xxx  deduced from a cdna clone obtained in this study
was consistent with that of the deposited clone in genbank (accession number bc009849). the amino acid sequence of hsdh was from j05037 with revisions. filled
and open triangles denote the lysine residue capable of forming a schiff base with plp, and the position of a pro residue missing in  xxxg2044xxx , respectively. the glycinerich sequence is underlined. the square indicates the a putative lysine residue at which hsdh but not  xxxg2044xxx  is strongly cleaved by trypsin (see the text). the thick bar
indicates the region responsible for the low yield of  xxxg2044xxx  in e. coli (see text). arrows indicate the positions where introns are inserted in the corresponding exons of
genomic sequences. (b) gene organization of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh. the nucleotide sequences of  xxxg2044xxx  (official symbol, sdsl; gene id, 113675 ) and hsdh (official
symbol, sds; gene id, 10993) are from the entrez genome database.

result suggested that the abundance of  xxxg2044xxx  was much lower
than that of hsdh, and therefore conventional purification
procedures might encounter many difficulties. the approximate
level of  xxxg2044xxx  was estimated by western blotting with the rabbit
igg to rat sdh. as shown in fig. 3a, the level of  xxxg2044xxx  in the
extract was low compared with that of hsdh. next, we used to
the pet vector having a 6× histidine tag. an exogenous peptide
produced using this vector was 20 residues long (mr 2,309),
which is much smaller than the mr 26,000-protein from, e.g., the
 xxxg1073xxx  vector. fig. 3b shows sds-page at
each purification step. hsdh was seen as a major band in the
crude extract, but  xxxg2044xxx  was not seen, as was also the case with
the pcw vector (lanes 2 versus 5). however, the sdh activity
was eluted as a small but single peak upon deae-cellulose
chromatography. a plausible band became visible in the sample
with the highest activity upon s-200 gel filtration (lane 7). a
homogeneous preparation was obtained by ni2+-nat column
chromatography (lane 8). owing to the exogenous sequence
from the pet vector, both proteins were apparently larger than
the hsdh preparation obtained with the pcw vector (lanes 10,
11 versus 12). hsdh migrated slightly faster than  xxxg2044xxx  as

expected from their difference of mr. the findings of
experiment a suggested that  xxxg2044xxx  was cross-reactive with
the antibody to rat sdh. since the sequence identity between
the two proteins was about 60%, complete cross-reactivity of
 xxxg2044xxx  with the igg was needed for further analysis. fig. 3c
indicates that the cross-reactivity of  xxxg2044xxx  with the igg was
about half the reactivity of hsdh.  xxxg2044xxx  behaved in the same
manner as hsdh upon gel filtration, suggesting that  xxxg2044xxx  is
also a dimer.  xxxg2044xxx  was stable at 0 °c for at least 2 weeks, or
−80 °c for a long time.
3.4. kinetic properties
saturation kinetic were performed with purified hsdh and
 xxxg2044xxx  preparations.  xxxg2044xxx  exhibited michaelis kinetics as did
hsdh. the kinetic constants are listed in table 1. the km and
vmax values of hsdh for l-serine and  xxxd3361xxx  were almost
equivalent to those of the hsdh preparation produced using the
pcw vector, indicating that the n-terminal 20 residues from the
pet vector do not affect the kinetics. the most notable feature
was that the km value for  xxxd3361xxx , and vmax values for l-

965

the small domain of the two-domain structure of hsdh (rat
sdh). it was of interest to examine whether pro128 plays a key
role in the structure of the active site, and whether the difference
of the kinetic constants between  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh is due to the
absence or presence of a pro residue. to address these
questions, pro128 was deleted from hsdh (−pro) and a pro
residue was added to  xxxg2044xxx  (+pro). as expected, the hsdh
(−pro) enzyme was found to have altered kinetic constants for
both substrates and a 10-fold increased kd value for plp,
suggesting that pro128 is, in particular, involved in the plp
binding. on the other hand, the kinetics of  xxxg2044xxx  (+pro) did not
change. these kinetic data demonstrated that the structures of
the active sites of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh are significantly different.
3.5. effect of limited-proteolysis

fig. 2. rt-pcr products for  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh amplified from total rna from
six kinds of lung cancer cell lines. total rna was isolated from human lung
cancer cell lines a549, h226, pc14,  xxxd1322xxx , h441 and sq5 (numbered from left to
right). rt-pcr was carried out as described under materials and methods. an
aliquot thereof was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel in the presence of
ethidium bromide. upper and middle panels are for  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh cdnas,
respectively. western blot analysis was carried out for the cell lysates from
h226, pc14,  xxxd1322xxx , h441 that did not express hsdh mrna (lower panel). the
mono-specific igg was the same as in fig. 3. approximately 50 mug of the cell
lysate were used in each lane. “purified” and “liver ext.” denote 10 ng of the
purified rat liver sdh, and 3 mug of the crude rat liver extract (10,000×g
supernatant of the liver homogenate), respectively, in each lane.

serine and  xxxd3361xxx  of  xxxg2044xxx  were much smaller than those
of hsdh, while the km for l-serine of  xxxg2044xxx  was approximately
half that of hsdh. overall, the catalytic efficiency of  xxxg2044xxx  was
6.5- (l-serine) to 2-fold ( xxxd3361xxx ) lower than that of hsdh.
with hsdh, the km values for both substrates are known to be
almost the same, but the vmax value for  xxxd3361xxx  is slightly
smaller than that for l-serine [9]. in other words, l-serine is a
better substrate than  xxxd3361xxx  for hsdh. the inverse
tendency was seen for  xxxg2044xxx . interestingly, a chimeric enzyme
(see below) consisting of the n-terminal half of  xxxg2044xxx  (amino
acids no. 1–200) and the c-terminal half of hsdh (amino
acids no. 193–328) had kinetic constants for l-serine and lthreonine that were close to those of  xxxg2044xxx . this result
suggests that the domain responsible for the unique kinetic
property of  xxxg2044xxx  is localized in the first two thirds of the
protein from the n-terminus.
as shown in fig. 1,  xxxg2044xxx  lacks a pro residue corresponding
to pro128 in hsdh. pro128 is also conserved in rat sdh. this
residue participates in forming a turn between a beta-strand (113–
125) and an alpha-helix (130–133) and is exposed to the surface of

the limited-proteolysis experiment sometimes provides
useful information about the higher-order structure of a protein.
to examine the structural differences between  xxxg2044xxx  and
hsdh, we digested them with trypsin (t), chymotrypsin (c)
and subtilisin (s). the conditions for proteolysis were described
previously [9,18]. trypsin quickly cleaved a segment of about
mr 1,800 from both sdhs (fig. 4, lanes 2, 6). the recombinant
proteins carry a thrombin recognition motif (leu–val–pro–
arg–gly–ser) at the n terminal region. the peptide from the
n-terminus to the arg residue in this motif is mr 1,762 in size.
since there is neither a lys nor an arg residue in the c-terminal
region of either protein at the position that can give this
molecular size, trypsin was concluded to cut the arg residue in
this motif. following the n-terminal segment, trypsin released a
polypeptide of about mr 22,000. chymotrypsin and subtilisin
liberated a polypeptide of about mr 22,000 as well, but their
cleavage sites were expected to be closer to the n-terminus than
the sites cleaved by trypsin, because the thrombin recognition
motif was intact. in fact, the region from glu206 to lys221 in
rat sdh is specifically digested by trypsin, staphylococcus
aureus v8 protease, lysyl endopeptidase, subtilisin, chymotrypsin, and other proteases [18]. the crystal structures of rat
sdh and hsdh show that the region susceptible to these
proteases constitutes the entrance of the active sites of both
enzymes [7,8]. hsdh is also cleaved by trypsin, chymotrypsin
and subtilisin (ref. [9] and this study). lys-221 is conserved in
rat sdh, hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  (see fig. 1, filled square). taking
into consideration that rat sdh and hsdh have similar tertiary
structures, and  xxxg2044xxx  is virtually resistant to the three proteases
under the conditions tested, the findings obtained so far suggest
that the structure of the active site of  xxxg2044xxx  is different from that
of hsdh.
3.6. stability of  xxxg2044xxx 
in addition to the structural and kinetic differences
between  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh, another notable feature was
that the expression level of  xxxg2044xxx  was much lower that of
hsdh (fig. 3). it seemed possible that  xxxg2044xxx  is more
unstable than hsdh in cell-free extract or in vivo. as
described above, purified  xxxg2044xxx  was quite stable at a low

kept at 0 or 25 °c for 16 h and then subjected to western
blotting.  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh gave similar patterns. an atp

at unchanged levels after incubation at 0 or 25 °c for 16 h.

3.7. search for the region responsible for the low yield of  xxxg2044xxx 
in e. coli

fig. 4. limited proteolysis of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh. hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  were digested
with trypsin (t), chymotrypsin (c) or subtilisin (s), as described in materials
and methods. the digests were analyzed by 13.5% sds-page. the arrow
indicates the position of the major products liberated. the result is a
representative of two determinations.

showed no difference of electrophoretic patterns between
 xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh. these findings suggest that the stability
in vitro or in vivo is not a direct cause for the difference in
expression levels of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh.

to explain the results obtained so far, one possibility is the
translation efficiency is different between the two proteins. in
particular,  xxxg2044xxx  might carry a specific region responsible for
the low yield in e. coli. to demonstrate this assumption, we
roughly mapped a site of interest by constructing chimeric
proteins between  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh. an appropriate restriction
site common to both cdnas was not found in the center of the
respective open reading frame. instead, both cdnas carried
common ncoi sites around one third of the polypeptide length
from the stop codon (fig. 5a). the second ncoi site of hsdh
was made inactive by introducing a silent mutation. then, each
ndei–ncoi segment was exchanged, resulting in  xxxg2044xxx –hsdh
and hsdh– xxxg2044xxx  chimeric constructs (fig. 5b, upper panel).
the levels of the chimeric proteins were assessed by sdspage (cbb) and western blot (wb) analysis. the  xxxg2044xxx –

used for the creation of chimeric proteins. hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  cdnas had two and one ncoi sites in the open reading frame, respectively. the second ncoi site of hsdh
was disrupted by introducing a silent mutation. the amino acids corresponding to the restriction site are shown beneath. sali* (gtggag; val–glu) is an not a sali
(gtcgac; val–asp) site. the underlined bases of the sali* site were replaced by c, resulting in a sali site (see the details in the text). the black bar indicates the
region involved in the low yield of  xxxg2044xxx . (b) construction of two types of chimera between hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  at the ncoi site, and expression in e. coli. the details are
described in materials and methods. (c) a chimera of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh at the sali site. an aliquot of each extract was subjected to sds-page. after construction of
the chimera (lane 4), the sali site was made invalid resulting in the original codon for glu (lane 5). (d) introduction of a stop codon into a  xxxg2044xxx –hsdh chimera and
 xxxg2044xxx , and their expression in e. coli. stop codons were created at the indicated positions of the  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh chimera (c–h), and  xxxg2044xxx , and termed s1 to s5,
respectively. each sample was analyzed by sds-page and western blotting. in the case of western blotting of hsdh, a 0.1-mul aliquot lysate was used (lane 1 with
asterisk) and in the other lanes, 2 mul were loaded. (e) expression of hsdh having an artificial stop codon and  xxxg2044xxx  having a frame shift mutation. a stop codon was
made at the indicated position of hsdh. a  xxxg2044xxx  mutant protein that had a frame shift at the position indicated by the arrow was constructed.

968

h. ogawa et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1764 (2006) 961–971

hsdh chimera (c–h) was expressed at a level as high as
hsdh, whereas the level of the hsdh– xxxg2044xxx  chimera (h–c)
was about equal to that of  xxxg2044xxx , strongly suggesting that the
region responsible for the low expression is located in the cterminal portion of  xxxg2044xxx .
to narrow down the target region, additional chimeric
proteins were constructed. since there were no other useful
restriction sites common to the two cdnas between the ncoi
site and translation stop codon, a sali site (gtcgac; val–asp) in
place of the original sequence gtggag (sal*; val–glu) was
created about one fourth of the distance downstream from the
stop codon (fig. 5a), because the replacement of glu by asp
was considered likely to produce no dramatic conformational
change of the chimeric protein. as shown in fig. 5c lane 4, the
 xxxg2044xxx –hsdh chimera was expressed abundantly, indicating
that the region conferring the low yield resides near the cterminus of  xxxg2044xxx  (amino acid residues ∼270 to c-terminus).
to rule out the possibility that the high yield of the chimera was
due to the above replacement, the gtcgac sequence was changed
back to the original gtggag. the levels of the chimeric proteins
were similar irrespective of whether they contained asp or glu
(lane 5). to construct a chimera within about 270 residues of the
c-terminus was practically impossible.
among the about 60 candidate residues remaining, 35
residues are identical between  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh and are thus
considered to be unrelated to the present phenomenon, while
the remaining 25 residues were too numerous to be analyzed
individually. therefore, we attempted to introduce a stop
codon at appropriate sites of  xxxg2044xxx , assuming that if a
deleterious portion were not included in the modified  xxxg2044xxx ,
the level of the immature polypeptide should be increased.
first, a  xxxg2044xxx –hsdh chimera (at the sali* site) was tested
for making a stop codon at s1 or s2 (fig. 5d, upper panel).
introduction of these stop codons produced a polypeptide
with the predicted size and a level comparable to that of the
original  xxxg2044xxx –hsdh chimera (fig. 5d, lanes 4, 5),
suggesting that the element of interest resides between the
sali* and s1 sites. to test this notion, s3, s4 or s5 was
introduced into  xxxg2044xxx  at the position indicated. whereas s3
gave an intense band at the expected position (lane 6), s4 and
s5 markedly decreased the expression levels, as determined
by sds-page. western blotting made more clear the relative
amount of the polypeptide (lanes 7, 8). these findings imply
that the element responsible for the low yield of  xxxg2044xxx  is
located between s3 and s4, as shown by the black box.
during construction of a series of mutant proteins, we found
by chance an interesting mutant protein which carried a
frame-shifted sequence extending from the sali* site to a stop
codon in the pet vector. twenty additional residues
consequently were added to this protein (fig. 5e, upper
panel). this mutant protein was overexpressed, presumably
because of the lack of the deleterious element of  xxxg2044xxx  (lane
2). in hsdh, a stop codon at the position indicated in fig. 5e,
upper panel created an intense band with the expected size
(lane 3). these findings narrowed the site of interest to within
20 amino acid residues, and the immature polypeptides,
irrespective of whether they were derived from  xxxg2044xxx  or

hsdh, that contained about the first 260 residues from the nterminus were relatively stable in e. coli.
3.8. identification of the residue responsible for a low yield of
 xxxg2044xxx 
fig. 6a shows the amino acid sequence of  xxxg2044xxx  in which
the element of interest was expected to reside, aligned with the
corresponding regions of hsdh and rat sdh. we decided to
target llr (ctc–ctg–cgg) in  xxxg2044xxx  owing to the relatively large
sequence dissimilarity there among the three sequences. this
sequence was replaced with val–ile–gln (viq) ( xxxg889xxx –atc–cag),
which is present in hsdh. as shown by sds-page and
western blotting in fig. 6b, marked elevation of the mutated
 xxxg2044xxx  was observed. next, which residue in this sequence was
the most critical was examined. the amount of the leu287val
(l287v) mutant protein was found to be comparable to that of
the leu–leu–arg387–9val–ile–gln (llr387–9viq) protein, while those of leu288ile (l288i) and arg289gln
(r289q) were reduced. the densitometric data of western
blotting are shown beneath the image normalized by the amount
of  xxxg2044xxx . since the cross-reactivity of the igg with  xxxg2044xxx  is
about 50% weaker than the reactivity with hsdh (fig. 3c), the
level of hsdh was corrected from 14.3 to 7.2. the result
obtained here was surprising because valine and leucine are
similar amino acids, and play similar roles in the tertiary
structures of proteins. we therefore considered that the bacterial
expression level might have been affected by the nucleotide
rather than amino acid residue difference. l287v (gtc)
produced more protein than l287 (ctc). therefore, l287 (ctc)
was changed to various codons. the codons for leu are cta, ctg,
ctt, ctc, tta and ttg. as seen in fig. 6c, replacement of the first
pyrimidine by g was most effective, followed by a (lanes 4, 7),
while change of the third letter (ctg) was without effect (lane 5);
another leu codon ttg, slightly decreased the expression (lane
6); double replacement of the first and second nucleotides,
changing ctc to gcc (ala) was effective but less effective than
changing the codon to gct (lane 8). gly286 ( xxxg286xxx ) in  xxxg2044xxx  is
his and gly in hsdh and rat sdh, respectively. rat sdh is
expressed at a higher level than hsdh. for this reason we did
not further examine this residue. however, the protein containing g286h (ggc to cac) was more highly expressed than  xxxg2044xxx 
(lane 9). this result indicates that the codon at  xxxg286xxx  is also
important for the high-level expression of  xxxg2044xxx .
3.9. in vitro transcription and translation experiment
to confirm the above in vivo results, we carried out an in
vitro transcription and translation experiment (fig. 7). a
positive control dna for ef-ts produced a major protein
band, but no protein band was seen on sds-page when a
hsdh or  xxxg2044xxx  template was used (upper panel). the positive
control dna was used the most efficiently in this system and
the products produced using eukaryotic dna as templates
seems to be less abundant. in fact, western blotting revealed an
hsdh band at the expected position (lane 3, lower panel),
whereas no band of  xxxg2044xxx  (lane 4) or l287l (lane 7) was seen.

than those of hsdh or the chimera, which is consistent with the
in vivo results. large amounts of the l287a and g286h
proteins were produced. these findings basically support the
conclusions made based on the in vivo experiments.
4. discussion

fig. 6. identification of a residue(s) responsible for the low expression of  xxxg2044xxx .
(a) the amino acid sequence of  xxxg2044xxx  relevant to the low yield of protein, and
corresponding amino acid sequences of hsdh and rat hsdh are aligned. the
llr related to the low yield of  xxxg2044xxx  is emphasized in bold. asterisks denote
invariant amino acids among the three sequences. (b) e. coli strains carrying the
six kinds of sdh were cultured, and 2 and 1 mul of whole lysate were subjected to
sds-page and western blotting, respectively, as described in materials and
methods. the intensity of each band obtained by western blotting was quantified
by nih image densitometry. expression levels were standardized by the  xxxg2044xxx 
level. since the cross-reactivity of the igg with  xxxg2044xxx  was about 2-fold weaker
than the reactivity with hsdh, the hsdh level was corrected as shown in
parentheses. (c) expression of various kinds of sdh. in addition to hsdh,
 xxxg2044xxx , l287, and additional five kinds of stains carrying  xxxg2044xxx  mutations were
examined. two and 1 mul of each lysate was subjected to sds-page and western
blotting, respectively. italic letters in parentheses denote the codons.

these results are in good agreement with those of the in vivo
experiments. an intense band for a  xxxg2044xxx –hsdh chimera was
seen between the positions of hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  (lane 5). l287v
was also seen at the expected position but its amount was lower

the pitot group [4] first reported the occurrence of two
isozymes of sdh separable by deae cellulose chromatography of rat liver extract. their expression was regulated by
glucagon and glucocorticoid, but their amino acid compositions
as well as kinetic constants were quite similar. although these
isozymes were confirmed by several laboratories (ref. [21] for
review), the mechanisms for the generation and hormonal
control of the isozymes remained elusive. the two isozymes are
probably produced by posttranslational modifications, whereas
 xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh in the present study are encoded by different
genes.
generally, collection of a sufficient amount of protein for
crystallization from cultured cell lines is practically impossible.
moreover, preliminary experiments showed no appreciable
amount of  xxxg2044xxx  in cell lysates. therefore, we cloned a cdna
for  xxxg2044xxx  from human lung cancer cells, expressed it in e. coli,
and characterized its physicochemical properties. the kinetic
constants and patterns of limited-proteolysis were largely
different between  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh. the experiments removing
pro128 from hsdh and inserting a pro residue into  xxxg2044xxx 
produced the different results. these findings strongly suggested that the structure of the active site of  xxxg2044xxx  is distinct
from that of hsdh. the crystallographic analysis of  xxxg2044xxx  is
currently underway.
the second problem we encountered was not expected at the
beginning of this study, because we had already succeeded in
high-level expression of hsdh and rat sdh in e. coli using the
pcw vector [9,18]. initially, it was considered that the low
accumulation of  xxxg2044xxx  was due to heat-instability or high
protease susceptibility. however, several lines of evidence
almost completely ruled out these possibilities. we then
searched for the element responsible for the low yield of the
protein by constructing chimeric and mutated proteins. based
on the results, leu287 was identified as a critical residue for this
phenomenon.  xxxg286xxx , l288 and r289 also played some role in
this phenomenon. the low yield of  xxxg2044xxx  was found to be due
to low translation efficiency, which is influenced by (1) codon
usage and (2) secondary structure of the mrna. as to (1), a
small number of rare codons may hamper the synthesis of
proteins: the codon usage of agg, aga, cgg, or cga for arg, ggc
for gly, ata for ile, cta for leu and ccc for pro is very rare in e.
coli [22]. we compared the codon usage between the two
cdnas. however, there is no significant difference in the codon
availability (not shown).
as to (2), this possibility seems more likely. l287v and
l287a, in which the first nucleotide of the codon was changed
from pyrimidine to purine gave good yields of  xxxg2044xxx . the
change of the third nucleotide of the codon from pyrimidine to
purine was without effect (fig. 6c, lanes 5, 6). it is difficult to
predict the secondary structure of an entire sdh mrna.

fig. 7. in vitro transcription and translation experiment. the in vitro transcription and translation reaction was performed in a 25-mul volume as described under
materials and methods. five- or 2-mul aliquots thereof were subjected to sds-page (upper panel) or western blotting (lower panel), respectively. a portion of the
lysate expressing  xxxg2044xxx  (fig. 6b) was used as a size marker (lane 12). the positions of  xxxg2044xxx  and hsdh are shown by arrows. the experiment was performed thrice
and the consistent results were obtained.

furthermore, to do so is meaningless because a minute change
occurring in a local region fails to alter the huge deltag of the
whole structure. for this reason, we calculated each deltag of a 60nucleotide sequence encompassing the codon for l287 or
another codon by the mfold algorithm (ref. [23]; web server
available at http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/∼zukerm/rna). the deltag
values are listed in increasing in table 2. the value of the deltag
was roughly inversely correlated with that of the expression
level of various sdhs standardized by the  xxxg2044xxx  level. the deltag
of  xxxg2044xxx  was found to be much larger than that of hsdh,
suggesting that the structure of  xxxg2044xxx  mrna is thermodynamically more stable than that of hsdh mrna. the replacement
of only one base dramatically influenced the deltag, e.g. of l287v
(gtc) but not l287l (ctg). hsdh was expressed 7-fold more

free energy change of the 60-nucleotide sequence, 836-ccuuagcagccaucuacucaggccuccugcggaggcuccaggccgagggcugccugcccc-895 in  xxxg2044xxx  mrna, was
calculated using an algorithm for prediction of the secondary structure of rna
(zucker, 2003). the bold and underlined nucleotides are the codon for l287.
the 70-nucleotide sequence in hsdh mrna which corresponds to the above
sequence is compared. “expression level” means values standardized by the
expression level of  xxxg2044xxx  in e. coli (fig. 6b, c). the folding conditions were:
temperature, 37 °c; ionic strength, 1 m nacl; no divalent cations.

strongly than  xxxg2044xxx  in e. coli. the deltag of hsdh is the minimal
value in this table. the deltag values of other 60-nucleotide
sequences adjacent to the n-terminal or c-terminal side of the
60-nucleotide sequence surrounding the codon for l287 ranged
−14 to −20 kcal/mol. these values were smaller than the
−27.2 kcal/mol of the 60-nucleotide sequence around the codon
for l287. therefore, the secondary structure of the nucleotide
sequence surrounding l287 (ctc) is considered to reduce the
speed of protein synthesis by ribosomes. actually, the mfold
algorithm clearly depicts that the secondary structures of l287
(ctc), l287l (ctg), l287v (gtc), and the corresponding
sequence of hsdh are largely different (model structures not
shown). the codon ctc for l287 exists in a stretch of seven
paired bases consisting of the top of the stem structure, but
when this long duplex is disrupted by replacement with the
codon gtc (l287v), a marked decrease in deltag results.
replacement of ctc by ctg (l287l) does not alter the number
of paired-bases so that the deltag is almost unchanged and the
expression level remains low. in hsdh, a stem structure like
that in  xxxg2044xxx  is  xxxd3237xxx . accordingly, the deltag is the
smallest observed here, which is consistent with hsdh having
strongest expression among the sequences tested. collectively,
the results of the codon usage and deltag values of the secondary
structure of various mrnas lead to the conclusion that the poor
expression of  xxxg2044xxx  can be explained by low translation
efficiency based on the secondary structure of the mrna. the
lack of an appreciable amount of  xxxg2044xxx  in lysates of various
lung cancer cells may be due to the secondary structure of  xxxg2044xxx 
mrna.
recently, edgar reported the expression levels of sdh and
sdh-like 1 mrnas in adult mice and developing whole mouse
embryos obtained by real-time pcr [24]. sdh and sdh-like 1
in mouse are considered to correspond to hsdh and  xxxg2044xxx  in
this study, respectively. since the expression levels in each
organ are standardized by the hepatic level, the absolute
expression levels of both mrnas are not known. in adult mice,

h. ogawa et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1764 (2006) 961–971

sdh is expressed predominantly in the livers, followed by heart
at only one-hundredth the level in liver, while the levels of
sdh-like 1 mrna in heart, kidney, spleen, and testis are >onetenth of the hepatic liver level. that is to say, sdh-like 1 is
expressed widely in various organs. we reported previously that
the sdh level in rat kidney was about 5% relative to that in
liver, as determined by northern blotting [25], whereas the
results of edgar showed that the renal sdh level in mice was
about 0.001% relative to the level in the liver. it will be
necessary to simultaneously determine the levels of both sdh
proteins in various organs of mouse and rat, and to perform
northern blot analysis to examine the relative levels of the
corresponding mrnas.
some of the enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism
have two or more isozymes, one of which is expressed in cancer
cells. for instance, regulation of methionine adenosyltransferase isozymes (mats) has been extensively studied [26]. a
switch in mat expression from  xxxg1378xxx  to  xxxg1379xxx  plays a
pathogenetic role in liver carcinogenesis, because the pool of
methyl groups provided by methionine adenosyltransferase
must be regulated for transmethylation of the nucleic acids,
which is involved in regulating gene expression [27]. although
it was shown here that the  xxxg2044xxx  gene is transcribed but poorly
translated, the physiological significance of the fact that  xxxg2044xxx 
gene is expressed in cancerous cells must be clarified in future
studies.
