conversion of human apoholomethionine
to
synthase
holoenzyme when assayed subsequently under assay conditions that contain a powerful reducing system and  xxxd3156xxx  in addition to ns-methyltetrahydrofolate and
homocysteine and no additional cbl (3). theaddition of mecbl to similar enzyme assays containing crude tissue extracts
frequently increases the  xxxg1479xxx  activity above
that seen without added me-cbl (11-13). this has been
interpreted (11, 12) as showing that me-cbl reconstitutes
apomethionine synthase, this interpretation can be seriously
questioned, however, since the addition of other forms of cbl,
such as  xxxd1771xxx ,  xxxd2300xxx , and ado-cbl, causes similar increases in  xxxg1479xxx  activity (11,13) and because
all forms of cbl increase the reducing power of the assay
conditions via the peel effect (14).
it is unclear what forms of cbl bind to  xxxg1479xxx 
and the mechanisms by which they stimulate its activity.
here we have studied activation of apomethionine synthase
by various forms of cbl that contain alterations in the upper
axial ligand. cob(i1)alaminbut notme-cbl was found to bind
to human apomethionine synthase. these studies also demonstrate that a wide variety of cobalamin analogues with
alterations in various portions of the cobalamin molecule
other than theupper axial ligand are also capable of binding
t o and activating humanapomethionine synthase.
materialsandmethods

human  xxxg1479xxx  was isolated in its apo form as described previously (3). it had aspecific activity of less than 0.001 eu/
mg before and 0.019-0.022 eu/mg after saturation with cbl where 1
eu denotes 1 pmollmin of product formation. the specific activity
of holoenzyme with a molecular weight of 160,000 corresponds to a
turnover number of about 3 min" which is much lower than the
turnover number of about 1000 min" for the enzyme from escherichia
coli (4). the value of 3 min" is also much lower than that reported
for the enzyme isolated from hog kidney. we have no explanation for
these differences, which were discussed and examined in detail previously (3). based on studies in crude extracts with various assays
(table 4 in ref. 3), we believe that there may not be a difference
between the turnover of the two mammalian enzymes.
hog nonintrinsic factor (i.e.hog r-protein) coupled to sepharose
was prepared as described previously (15) and had a cbl-binding
capacity of approximately 100 nmol/ml sepharose. allof the cbl
analogues were synthesized as described previously (16).  xxxd2300xxx ,
 xxxd1771xxx , me-cbl, and ado-cbl wereobtained from sigma.
except where indicated, total  xxxg1479xxx  activity was
assayed in a final volume of 1.0 ml. test tubes (12 x 75 mm) were
placed in an ice bath at 4 "c and contained 50 pmol of potassium
phosphate, ph 7.5,200 pmol of  xxxg2020xxx ,150 pmolof  xxxd26xxx ,
2.5 mmolof l-homocysteine, 100 nmol of  xxxd3156xxx , 75
nmol of a@-methyltetrahydrofolic acid containing 20 nci of
ns[methyl-'4c]tetrahydr~ xxxd2146xxx , 100 nmol of fadh2 (prepared
from 10 pmol of fad plus 32 mg of platinum oxide with bubbling of
hydrogen gas for 10 min), 37 nmol of  xxxd1771xxx , and varying amounts
of enzyme which was always added last. after incubation for 40 min
a t 37 "c, samples were boiled for 3 min and cooled to 4 "c. methionine-coated charcoal (17) was added to remove n'[methyi-''cc]tetrahydrofolate. the ["clmethionine product was determined by counting 1 mlof the supernatant of the charcoal-treated sample after
centrifugation at 40,000 x g for 30 min. this complete enzyme assay
system was also used to determine holoenzyme activity in an identical
reaction, but in the absence of added cbl. the difference between the
total enzyme activity and the holoenzyme activity was taken as the
functional apoenzyme activity.
the purified preparation of  xxxg1479xxx  was enriched in
apomethionine synthase activity by selecting placentas that demonstrated high apomethionine synthase activity (at least 90%) based
upon the above differential assay.
because the peel effect (14) could have resulted in misleading
estimates of the quantity of apomethionine synthase in the final
purified preparation using the above assay, we determined the quantity of apomethionine synthase in the purified enzyme used in this
study by incubating the purified enzyme preparation with excess
["co]cob(ii)alamin followed by dialysis as described previously (3).

23011

we found that the enzyme used in the present studies bound 0.921.11nmol of cob(ii)alamin/nmol of  xxxg1479xxx . based upon
a previously determined stoichiometry of 1 nmol of cob(i1)alamin
bound/nmol (165 pg) of  xxxg1479xxx  (3), we conclude that a
minimum of 92% of the purified  xxxg1479xxx  was in the
apomethionine synthase form. this conclusion was also supported by
spectral studies (3) that failed to show any cbl bound to the final
preparation of purified enzyme used in the current studies. these
calculations were based on previous studies (3) that demonstrated
that 1 nmol of purified apomethionine synthase in 1 mlof 0.2 m
kpo,, ph 7.5, has an a,,,of
0.241 and a311of 0.059. comparable
values for 1 nmol of holomethionine synthase were an azm of 0.256
and aal1 of 0.087. based on these values, we calculate that the ratio
asll/azso is 0.245 and 0.340 for apo- and holomethionine synthase,
respectively. these values were used to calculate the proportion of
apo- and holomethionine synthase after purified apomethionine synthase was incubated with saturating amounts of various forms of cbl
followed by removal of unbound cbl (see below).
the above values not only indicated the percent of the purified
 xxxg1479xxx  that was in the apoenzyme form but also addressed the purity of the enzyme. the near 1:l stoichiometry of
binding of cob(1i)alamin and thefinal specific activity are both very
similar to our previously published (3) results with purified human
 xxxg1479xxx .
removal of the radioactive upper axial ligands was determined by
adding 1 mlof dextran-coated charcoal (prepared as 0.5% dextran
(m,40,000) and 5% norit charcoal (18)) to 1 ml of reaction mixture
and centrifuging at 2,000 x g for 10 min. one ml of the supernatant
was mixedwith 10 ml of 3a70 scintillation fluid (rpi, elk grove, il)
and the amount of radioactivity determined in a liquid scintillation
counter with a counting efficiency of 70%. the percent of "c upper
axial ligand that remained bound to cbl wasdetermined by subtracting the radioactivity released into the charcoal supernatant from the
total (100%) added to the assay.
[14c]cn-cblwas prepared by reacting 5 mg of  xxxd2300xxx  with a 10fold molar excess of potassium ['tlcyanide in the dark in0.1 m
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, at 4 "c for 48 h. ['4c]chs-cbl
was prepared by reacting 5 mg of  xxxd2300xxx  with sodium borohydride
and ["cichj, as described by dolphin (19). radioactive  xxxd1771xxx  and
cha-cbl (each in 5 ml) were purified on a 5x 0.5-cm column of sm2 biobeads (bio-rad). each column was prewashed with 2 ml of
methanol followed by 15 ml of h20. after the samples were applied,
each column was washed with 15 mlofh,o and the samples were
eluted with 3 ml of methanol followed by drying in a savant drying
centrifuge in the dark. the dried residues were solubilized in 0.01 m
sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.5, and applied to a 5 x 0.5-cm column of
the cation exchange resin sp (sulfopropy1)-sephadex(sp- xxxd1102xxx -120,
sigma) equilibrated with the same buffer. the samples were applied
in avolume of 1 ml and washed with 2 ml of equilibrating buffer. the
3-ml initial run-through containedgreater than 95% of the radioactive
 xxxd1771xxx  or chz-cbl while greater than 98% of residual  xxxd2300xxx 
remained adsorbed to thesp-sephadex. samples were again desalted
with the sm-2 biobeads column technique including elution with
methanol and drying as described above. followingthese procedures,
greater than 99% of the 14c wasadsorbed by dextran-coated charcoal
for each radioactive ligand.
photolysis of me-cbl was accomplished under anaerobic conditions
using anebr 375-watt lamp (general electric co., nela park,
cleveland, oh) at 20 cm from the sample as described by hogenkamp
(20) except that a continuous flowof argon was maintained (30-45
min) until the photolyzed me-cbl was dried to a brown residue. a
dayton model4c800 fan (dayton electrical manufacturing co.,
chicago, il) was positioned 20 cm from the samples and was used to
prevent heating to above 39 "c during photolysis. cbl in 1 ml of h 2 0
were placed in 50-ml erlenmeyer flasks with rubber stoppers containing inlet needles and exit needles. argon was passed through these
samples in the dark for 10 min prior to exposure to light. the exit
tubing was fitted such that a back pressure of30cmof
h,o was
maintained during the constantbubbling of argon.
sodium borohydride treatment toremove the upper axial ligand of
 xxxd1771xxx  was performed as described by vitols et al. (21). fifty pg of
the respective cbls were dried and 700 p1 of argon degassed water
were added followed by 5 mgof dry nabh4. the samples stood at
22 "c in the dark for 30 min. to each sample 100 pl of 1 n hcl was
then added to quench excess nabh4 followed immediately by 200 ,.d
of 1 m potassium phosphate, ph 7.5.
a 7-10-pg aliquot of various forms of cbl treated with intense light
or nabh4 was diluted into 1 ml of degassed water, and spectra were

obtained with a hewlett-packard model 8452a diode array spectrophotometer. for purposes of quantitation, the following wavelengths
and molar extinction coefficients wereused:
cob(ii)alamin, 311
(27,500); me-cbl, 340 (13,300); and  xxxd1771xxx , 361(28,100) (8). the
spectrophotometer employed only measures even-numbered wavelengths. thus, when the previously reported absorption maximum
was 311 or 361, we used the average value between 310 and 312 and
between 360 and 362, respectively.
to quantitate cbl binding by purified apomethionine synthase, 12 nmol of enzyme (165-330 pg) in 0.2 m potassium phosphate, ph
7.5,was added to 10-20 nmol of cbl under anaerobic conditions
(argon degassing). removal of greater than 99% of unbound cbl was
accomplished using dextran-coated charcoal (see above), followed by
application of the supernatant toa 0.5 x 5-cm column of hog nonintrinsic factor-sepharose that was equilibrated with the phosphate
buffer. the effluent of the column was then assayed spectrophotometrically (3), using values for the ratio a311/a28,, as described above
to determine the proportion of apo- and holoenzyme.

(20) to

the results are summarized in table
i and reveal that
cob(1i)alamin was formed from  xxxd1771xxx  by treatment with
nabh, but not intense light and from me-cbl by treatment
with intense light but not by nabh,. in addition, binding of
the treated cbl to apomethionine synthase and activation
of
its enzymatic activity was always and only observed under
conditions in which cob(i1)alamin was formed. the results
of theexperimentsutilizingnabh,indicatethat
only
cob(i1)alamin or cob(1)alamin reconstitute apomethionine
synthase while experiments using intense light indicate that
cob(i1)alamin is sufficient to convert apo- to holomethionine
synthase. the results of the experiments thus suggest that
cob(i1)alamin is the formof cbl which can bind the apoenzyme since reduction of me-cbl under this condition (light)
only proceeds as far as cob(i1)alamin (20). however, these
results do not exclude the possibility that cob(1)alamin can
also convert apo- to holomethionine synthase.

the i n vivo effects of cbl analogues. studies involving the
characterization, isolation, and interactionof the mammalian
reductase and thelysosomal transporter with cbl and various
cbl analogues wouldbeof interest and are likely to show

differences
the mammalian enzymes and those of
certain bacteriathat have been elucidated by the elegant work
of huennekens (24) and matthews (25) and their co-workers.
