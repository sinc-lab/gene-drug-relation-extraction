abstract
acetylcholinesterase (ache) is one of nature's fastest
enzymes, despite the fact that its three-dimensional
structure reveals its active site to be deeply sequestered
within the molecule. this raises questions with respect to
traf®c of substrate to, and products from, the active site,
which may be investigated by time-resolved crystallography. in order to address one aspect of the feasibility
of performing time-resolved studies on ache, a data set
has been collected using the laue technique on a
trigonal crystal of torpedo californica ache soaked
with the reversible inhibitor  xxxd1968xxx , using a total
x-ray exposure time of 24 ms. electron-density maps
obtained from the laue data, which are of surprisingly
good quality compared with similar maps from monochromatic data, show essentially the same features. they
clearly reveal the bound ligand, as well as a structural
change in the conformation of the active-site ser200
induced upon binding.
1. introduction
1.1. reaction of ache
the principal function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (ache; e.c. 3.1.1.7) is rapid hydrolysis
of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ach) in the
central nervous system and at vertebrate neuromuscular
junctions (massoulieâ et al., 1993). as demanded by this
biological role, it is an extremely ef®cient catalyst,
approaching a reaction velocity at which substrate
diffusion becomes rate limiting, with a turnover number
of 20 000 sÿ1 (quinn, 1987). the x-ray structure of t.
californica ache (tcache) (sussman et al., 1991)
unexpectedly revealed that the active-site residues are
buried within the protein, apparently accessible only via
a long and narrow gorge lined with aromatic residues.

the ache molecule displays an asymmetric charge
distribution, resulting in a strong dipole moment aligned
approximately along the active-site gorge (ripoll et al.,
1993; tan et al., 1993). it has been suggested that the
electric ®eld so generated attracts the positively charged
ach to the rim of the gorge (ripoll et al., 1993). the
substrate is then guided by the electric ®eld, using the
aromatic residues in the gorge as a series of low-af®nity
sites, towards the active site. the side chains of two
aromatic residues, trp84 and phe330, serve as the socalled anionic site for binding the quarternary moiety of
ach via cation± interactions (verdonk et al., 1993;
dougherty, 1996). hydrolysis of ach to choline and
acetate is accomplished by the catalytic triad consisting
of ser200, his440 and glu327, with ser200 being transiently acetylated (quinn, 1987).
the narrow dimensions of the active-site gorge,
together with the potential gradient along it, raise
cogent questions regarding the traf®c of substrate and
products to and from the active site. thus, in addition to
steric considerations, the potential along the gorge
would be expected to accelerate expulsion of acetate but
retard release of choline from the active site. furthermore, movement of water between the bulk phase and
the gorge must be taken into account. theoretical
calculations, however, showed that it is still possible for
choline to go back through the gorge suf®ciently rapidly
if there is no steric hindrance (s. lifson, s. botti and c.
felder, personal communications). a second possibility
that has been proposed (ripoll et al., 1993) is that
choline leaves through a back door ± a transient opening
in the thin aspect of the gorge wall arising by movement
of one or more residues (gilson et al., 1994). the residues that contribute to the opening of the putative back
door are expected to be located on the -loop between
cys67 and cys94 in tcache (axelsen et al., 1994), a
loop which is known to adopt an open and closed
conformation in the structurally similar enzyme candida
rugosa lipase (grochulski et al., 1994). further evidence

static laue diffraction studies on acetylcholinesterase

for an alternative entrance to the gorge comes from
studies on the mode of inhibition of ache by the potent
snake-venom polypeptide toxin, fasciculin. crystallographic studies clearly demonstrate that the toxin
completely blocks the entrance to the active-site gorge
(bourne et al., 1995; harel et al., 1995). nevertheless,
signi®cant residual catalytic activity can be observed in
solution (marchot et al., 1993). site-directed mutagenesis studies which were designed to prove the importance of the mobility of certain residues did not,
however, provide support for the existence of a back
door (kronman et al., 1994; faerman et al., 1996).

initial goal was to obtain a data set of suf®cient quality
to permit the resolution of structural features within the
active site of the enzyme. to test this, crystals were
soaked with a solution of a small ligand,  xxxd1968xxx 
[ethyl(3-hydroxyphenyl)dimethyl ammonium, see fig. 1]
which is a known reversible inhibitor of ache. the
structure of the complex of tcache with  xxxd1968xxx 
was determined earlier using monochromatic radiation
(harel et al., 1993). comparison of electron-density
maps obtained from laue data with maps obtained from
monochromatic data should reveal whether use of the
laue technique is feasible for performing time-resolved
studies on ache.

1.2. laue method
time-resolved crystallography is clearly an approach
with the potential to provide direct experimental information to either support or refute the existence of a
back door, and the laue diffraction method has been
employed successfully in recent years to observe enzyme
reactions as they occur in the crystal state (schlichting et
al., 1990; bolduc et al., 1995). the technique is attractive
due to the very short exposure times required. recently,
crystallographic snapshots have been reported of
structural changes occurring in a protein on a time scale
as short as nanoseconds (særajer et al., 1996). a prerequisite for successful laue measurements is the
achievement of a high degree of synchronization of the
initiation of the reaction. in some cases, the substrate is
immobilized by attachment of a photosensitive chemical
moiety, effectively turning it into an inhibitor. such
caged compounds can then be activated by photolysis,
usually with laser ¯ashes. in the case of ache, a series
of caged compounds, which generate either choline or
carbamylcholine (cch) upon photolysis (peng &
goeldner, 1996; peng et al., 1996), have been synthesized and characterized photochemically and enzymatically. cch is a substrate of ache; the ®rst step of the
reaction, carbamylation of the enzyme, is rapid, but
decarbamylation is slow, on a time scale of minutes at
room temperature (wilson et al., 1960). it is envisaged
that synchronized photolysis of caged cch within the
crystal will produce rapid release of choline by the
enzymatic machinery and that movement of choline and
concomitant changes in the protein conformation may
be monitored by the laue method.
the laue technique has some inherent dif®culties,
such as a paucity of low-resolution re¯ections, overlap of
multiple spots, spatial overlap of streaked spots and an
unfavourable peak-to-background ratio (hajdu et al.,
1991). these drawbacks result in a requirement for well
diffracting crystals with low mosaic spread. since success
in laue diffraction experiments is not guaranteed even
if good diffraction is obtained under conditions of a
monochromatic experiment, we decided to evaluate the
quality of the data obtainable by the laue technique for
trigonal crystals of tcache (sussman et al., 1991). our

2. methods and results
2.1. monochromatic reference data
a monochromatic data set on the ache± xxxd1968xxx  complex was collected as a reference to provide a
fair comparison with the laue data set. the new data set
was obtained from crystals grown in the same way as
those for the laue data set, using peg 200 as a precipitant (raves et al., 1997), whereas the crystals used to
obtain the previously reported ache± xxxd1968xxx 
data (harel et al., 1993) were grown from ammonium
sulfate. in order to obtain data of the highest possible
quality, the new data set was collected at a synchrotron
source (embl outstation of the desy in hamburg,
ê , 30 cm mar
germany, beamline x11,  = 0.92 a
research image-plate detector). the crystal, 0.3  0.3 
0.2 mm, was cooled to 277 k and had a mosaic spread of
ê ; further

details on the quality of this data set are given in table 1.
the structure obtained from the monochromatic
synchrotron data set is virtually identical to the
previously determined structure with pdb access code
1ack (harel et al., 1993); the r.m.s. deviation between

coordinates for all c atoms is 0.29 a

2.2. laue data collection
laue data on crystals of ache soaked with  xxxd1968xxx  were collected at the european synchrotron
radiation facility (esrf) in grenoble, france, at the
white-radiation beamline bl3 (id9), with a wavelength
ê . with the synchrotron operating in
range of 0.4±1.5 a
1/3 ®ll mode at 200 ma, the crystals, mounted in a
capillary, were tested at a temperature of 277 k using an
fts cooling device. several crystals had to be discarded
due to lack of high-resolution re¯ections and/or severe
streaking of the spots. good diffraction was obtained
from a rather large crystal, 0.5  0.5  0.4 mm, that
showed a reasonably low mosaicity. 24 still frames with
an exposure time of 1 ms each and a crystal-to-®lm
distance of 300 mm were collected while rotating the

1361

crystal over 5 along the spindle axis between exposures.
the data, collected on an x-ray image intensi®er
coupled to a ccd camera, were corrected for spatial
distortions and non-uniformity of response with the
package ® xxxd797xxx  (hammersley et al., 1994).
2.3. laue data processing
the crystal-orientation parameters and relative cell
dimensions were determined using the program lauecell (ravelli et al., 1996). the scaled cell dimensions
ê ) are close to the values found
(a = b = 113.0, c = 136.8 a
for monochromatic data on non-frozen trigonal
tcache crystals in general. the program laueview
(ren & moffat, 1995a) was used for further processing
of the data. the laue spots on the patterns were
predicted using a resolution-dependent wavelength
bandpass, based on a known starting -curve and wilson
statistics. the wavelength normalization was performed
in two parts, since the distribution of the single spots as a
function of the wavelength is not uniform (see fig. 2);
ê
the single spots are densely distributed between 0.45 a
ê
(min) and 0.9 a (2min) and relatively sparsely at
wavelengths higher than 2min. the -curve for waveê was simulated with a
lengths between 0.45 and 0.9 a
16-term chebyshev polynomial and the curve for
ê with a three-term
wavelengths between 0.9 and 1.25 a
chebyshev. fig. 2 also shows a bragg-angle cut-off (i.e.
no spots in the upper right-hand corner of the ®gure);
the crystal diffracted beyond the edge of the detector.
the risk of overlapping spots, however, prevented a
signi®cant reduction of the crystal-to-detector distance.
the resolution limit (dmin) used for the processing of the
ê , compared with 2.4 a
ê for the
laue data set is 2.8 a
monochromatic data. the combined -curve (shown in
fig. 3) was used for deconvolution of the multiples (ren
& moffat, 1995b), which signi®cantly increased the
completeness of the data, especially in the 1±2dmin
range. details of the quality of the laue data set are
given in table 2. the overall completeness is 84.5%. the
amplitudes of the full laue data set give a correlation of
91.6% with those of corresponding re¯ections in the
monochromatic data set (see fig. 4); for the singles, the
correlation is 93.4% and for the deconvoluted multiples,
87.8%.
2.4. re®nement

the bragg angle cut-off is clearly seen at higher wavelengths and
higher resolution (see ren & moffat, 1995a).

the same re®nement procedure was used for both the
monochromatic and the laue data set. the coordinates
of native tcache in the trigonal crystal form (pdb
access code 2ace; raves et al., 1997) were used as a
starting model; 5% of the data (1891 re¯ections for the
monochromatic, 1032 for the laue data) were reserved
in a test set for cross-validation of the re®nement
process. to reduce the chance of introducing model bias
into the initial maps, the re¯ections for the test set were
taken by selecting the corresponding re¯ections from

3. discussion
obtaining a data set of reasonable quality from laue
diffraction is not a guaranteed success for every crystallized protein. the laue method has been applied with
good results to well behaved proteins such as cutinase
(bourgeois et al., 1997), restrictocin (yang et al., 1998)
and photoactive yellow protein (genick et al., 1997), and
to crystals of high symmetry, such as tomato bushy-stunt
virus (campbell et al., 1990). since the question of the
exact pathway of reaction products from the active site
of ache has been raised, a suitable method has been
searched for that would prove unequivocally whether or
not there is a back door in the active-site gorge. laue
diffraction, with its extremely short exposure times and
high information content per image, could very well
supply this information, provided that four conditions
are met:
(i) the initiation of the enzymatic reaction needs to be
synchronized;
(ii) the reaction needs to be brought to a time scale
commensurate with that of the data collection;
(iii) the existence of intermediate states needs to be
ascertained and
(iv) the laue data need to be of suf®cient quality.
the synchronization is currently being investigated
using caged compounds which have been developed for
this purpose. the synthesis and chemical properties of
nitrobenzyl derivatives of choline and of carbamylcholine have been studied, as well as their interaction with
ache, both in solution (peng & goeldner, 1996; peng et
al., 1996) and in the crystal state using monochromatic
crystallography (m. l. raves, unpublished results). the
temporal and spatial uniformity of reaction initiation
depends on the penetration depth of the laser light into
the crystal (chen, 1994).
² atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with
the protein data bank, brookhaven national laboratory (references:
2ack, r2acksf, 1ax9 and r1ax9sf).

raimond b. g. ravelli et al.
both the time scale of the release of choline from the
active site and of the reaction of carbamylcholine are
complex issues, since they must be measured in the
crystal state, with hampered diffusion, at a temperature
and ph that deviate from the conditions normally used
for measuring the activity of the enzyme.
the existence of one intermediate state in the
hydrolysis of ach, the acetylated enzyme, is well known
(froede & wilson, 1984). the carbamylated enzyme
formed during the hydrolysis of carbamylcholine
provides an even better intermediate that should be
observable using time-resolved crystallography, because
the decarbamylation of the enzyme is a much slower
reaction than deacylation (wilson et al., 1960). however,
since the pathway of the release of the reaction product
of interest, choline, is unknown, the question whether a
signi®cantly populated intermediate state is involved in
this release cannot be answered at this point.
the quality of the laue data depends on the resolution and completeness attainable, the reliability of the
measured intensities and the interpretability of the
electron-density maps that follows from these factors.
3.1. quality of laue data
unlike in monochromatic diffraction experiments, the
high-resolution spots in a laue image not only have a
higher bragg angle on average, placing them further
towards the edge of the detector, but also result in a
higher density of spots in all regions of the image. in the
case of ache, where all three unit-cell axes are longer
ê and the mosaicity of the crystals is rarely
than 100 a

below 0.2 , spatial overlap of spots is problematic. the
resolution cut-off chosen for the data set described in

fig. 4. correlation plot between laue and monochromatic structurefactor amplitudes. the correlation is 91.6%, based on 19 725 unique
re¯ections that were observed in both data sets.

1363

ê , was based on the i/ and
the previous section, 2.8 a
completeness of the spots at higher resolution, and the
conditions of the experiment. for the purpose of these
studies and the kind of structural changes we hope to
see, this resolution should be adequate.
in terms of completeness (see table 2), the quality
of the data set is very good: 95.2% in the mediumê ). the problem of the lowresolution range (5.6±3.4 a
resolution hole (hajdu et al., 1991) has largely been
overcome, as judged by the completeness of 82.8%
ê (2dmin). high completeness at low
between 1 and 5.6 a
resolution stems from the fact that a relatively large
number (24) of frames were collected, aided by a
powerful deconvolution algorithm (ren & moffat,
1995b). at higher resolutions, the completeness of the
re¯ections is lower, but fully adequate for inclusion in
the data set.
the amplitudes of the re¯ections correlate fairly well
with those of the monochromatic data set. from fig. 4 it
can be seen that there is a slight tendency to overestimate weak re¯ections in the laue data set, but the
overall correlation coef®cient of 91.6% indicates that
the amplitudes are fairly reliable. the rsym of the laue
data set (14.8 versus 6.5% for the monochromatic data
ê ) also indicates a reduction in the quality of
up to 2.8 a
the data, but is still acceptable given the reduction in
total x-ray exposure from several hours to 24 ms.
the problem of spatially overlapping spots, as
observed in the data set, would have been aggravated by
a substantial reduction of the crystal-to-detector
distance (e.g. 200 instead of 300 mm). a reduction of the
distance could improve the completeness and/or resolution limit of the data, as long as the software used for
integration (helliwell et al., 1989; ren & moffat, 1995a;
bourgeois et al., 1998) is capable of reliably deconvoluting most overlapping re¯ections. a  offset of the
detector, however, could have been instrumental in
obtaining more unique data, as indicated by the bragg
cut-off in fig. 2. two data-collection strategies that could
also have been bene®cial for these crystals were
described by yang et al. (1998); regulation of the
exposure time so as to reduce the extent of x-ray
heating of the crystal, and utilization of two different
exposure times to obtain well exposed low- and highresolution data.
since the program laueview (ren & moffat, 1995a)
gives the user full manual control of the integration,
rejection and scaling criteria, the completeness of the
data set is a trade-off against other parameters which are
indicative for the quality of the data. for example, the
inclusion of the non-redundant singles into the data set
improved the completeness, but caused some deterioration in the correlation with the monochromatic
data. in addition, the determination of the wavelengthnormalization curve strongly depends on the accuracy of
the intensities, and special care had to be taken not to
include too many unreliable measurements, while still

1364

being left with as high a redundancy as possible. the
®nal wavelength-normalization curve obtained (fig. 3)
did not show ®ne details such as the pt edges arising
from the focusing mirror (ren & moffat, 1995a), but has
the correct overall appearance.
3.2. map quality
special consideration was given to the problem of
model bias in the initial electron-density maps, since the
structure to be determined from the laue data is very
similar to that of the protein in the native state. to this
effect, the same re¯ections that were used in the test set
in the re®nement of the initial starting model (raves et
al., 1997) were ¯agged in the monochromatic and laue

data sets of the  xxxd1968xxx  complex (kleywegt &
bruènger, 1996). after rigid-body re®nement of the
entire protein, the difference between r and rfree indicates that most of the model bias has been avoided.
fig. 5 shows a comparison of the fourier difference
maps after rigid-body re®nement of the active-site
region for the complete monochromatic data set
(fig. 5a), for the selection of re¯ections from the
monochromatic data set which are present in the laue
data set (fig. 5b) and for the laue data set (fig. 5c). as
is to be expected, the electron-density difference maps
made using the laue data are of somewhat lower quality
than the ones obtained using the monochromatic data;
the signals are weaker, the maps are noisier and show
less detail, which re¯ects the difference in rsym values

and completeness for the two data sets. nevertheless,
the difference map from the laue data clearly shows the
location, orientation and shape of the soaked-in inhibitor,  xxxd1968xxx . in addition, a peak search on the
initial laue difference map yielded 78 peaks higher than
3.0 that correspond to water molecules in the monochromatic structure, indicating that the maps are interpretable. for some of the incomplete side chains in the
initial model (61 atoms in 23 different residues are
disordered in the native structure), several atoms could
be located in the maps for the monochromatic structure,
reducing the number of missing atoms to 57 in 22 residues. the laue maps showed even more of the missing

1365

atoms, leaving only 51 atoms in 19 residues undetermined. the amount of information that could be
obtained from the laue maps is somewhat surprising,
given the quality of the data. it is especially encouraging
to observe that the conformational change that o of the
active-site ser200 undergoes upon binding of  xxxd1968xxx  (harel et al., 1993), from hydrogen bonding to
his440 in the native state to interacting with the oxyanion hole in the complex, is visible in the electrondensity maps of the laue data set (see fig. 6). such
detailed information will be extremely relevant in the
determination of a transient intermediate structure and
of structural changes during the enzymatic reaction.
4. conclusions
it has been shown that the laue technique can be reliably applied to crystals of a protein as large as ache in
a static state. the maps from a data set of 24 images, with
an overall completeness of 84.5% and an rsym
(unweighted) of 14.8%, clearly reveal the position of the
ligand inside the active site and structural changes in
important protein residues. the laue data set does not
represent the maximum quality attainable for ache
crystals: using a  offset for the detector, two different
exposure times and reducing the extent of x-ray heating
of the crystal can improve the useful resolution limit and
the reliability of the intensities. to improve the usefulness of the laue method for ache, future studies will
concentrate on the synchronization of the initiation of
the enzymatic reaction and its time scale.
