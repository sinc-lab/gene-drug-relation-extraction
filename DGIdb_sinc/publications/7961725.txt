5-ethynyluracilis a time-dependent and tight binding
inhibitor of  xxxg2431xxx . themaximal value of the
first-order rate constant for onsetof inhibition is 0.01 s-l,
and the concentration of  xxxd1994xxx  which gives
one-half of this value is 190 w.because the t,, for formation of activeenzymefrom
inhibited enzyme is
greater than30 h in the absence of nadh, inhibition of
 xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx  is functionally irreversible.
one
equivalent
of 5-[2-'4c]ethynyluraciy
equivalent of active enzyme is required for complete
inhibition. allopurinol (100 w),
a potent inhibitor of
 xxxg2431xxx , and cyanide (5 mm), an inactivator of
the enzyme, do not abolishthe binding of 5-[2-14c]ethynyluracil to the enzyme. because radiolabelis released
from 5-[2-'4clethynyluracil-treated enzymeby
treatment with 6 m guanidine hcl, a stable covalent bond is
not formed between
the inhibitor and the enzyme. however, the radiolabel released from inhibited enzyme is
not  xxxd1994xxx . moreover,nadh restores catalytic
activity to the inhibited enzyme and displaces the radiolabel as 5-acetyluracil. thermaldenaturation of  xxxd1994xxx -inhibited  xxxg2431xxx  results in the release of approximately equal amounts of 5-acetyluracil
and a morehydrophilicproduct.consequently,
the
 xxxd1994xxx -xanthineoxidase complex yields different degradation products of  xxxd1994xxx  undei. different denaturation conditions. seven uracil analogues
with 5-substituents were tested as time-dependent inhibitors of  xxxg2431xxx .  xxxd1994xxx 
is the only
uracil analogue that potently inhibited  xxxg2431xxx . thereactivity of these uracil derivatives with sulfite .was also determined. 5-ethynyluracilis many fold
more susceptibleto nonenzymatic nucleophilicaddition
of sulfite than are the other analogues. thus, the potency of these uracil analogues as inhibitors of xanthine
oxidase is related to the nonenzymatic reactivity of the
analogues with sulfite.

of 5-fluorou-.
racil(5, 6). however,  xxxd1994xxx  anda potential anabolite
are mechanism-based inactivators of other enzymes. for example,  xxxd1994xxx  inactivates thymine hydroxylase from
rhodotorula glutinisby covalent modificationof the enzyme in
a reaction that requires the substrate a-ketoglutarate (7, 8).
similarly, 5-ethynyl-2'- xxxd1838xxx ,
a potential anaboliteof
 xxxd1994xxx , inactivates  xxxg2366xxx  from lactobacillus casei by formation of a covalent adduct inthe presence of 5,lo-methylenetetrahydrofolicacid (9).
 xxxd1994xxx  and other 5-substituted uracil analogues are
intrinsically reactive with nucleophiles (9-14). for example,
thiols readily add acrossthe acetylenic bondof  xxxd1994xxx 
(30% reaction after 1 h with 75 ii~mp- xxxd26xxx  at p h
7.4 (9)).thus,  xxxd1994xxx  could function
as an affinity
label if it bound at an enzymic site with propitious positioning
of nucleophilic residues. for example,  xxxg2431xxx  slowly
loses activity during the oxidation of 5-ethynyl-2-(1h)-pyrimor
idinone to  xxxd1994xxx  which is not prevented by catalase
superoxide dismutase (15). this inhibition is presumably due
to the accumulation
of  xxxd1994xxx . becauseof the potential
therapeutic importanceof  xxxg2431xxx  inhibitors (16, 17)
and the importance of understanding the reactivityof  xxxd1994xxx  with different enzymes
if  xxxd1994xxx  is to be used
therapeutically to modulate 5-fluorouracil metabolism(5, 61,a

inhibited enzyme that was diluted 100-fold into the standard
assay did not recovery activity over the course of a 10-min
assay, which indicated that the rate of dissociation of the inhibitor was slow. furthermore, completely inhibited enzyme
did not catalyze the reduction of 50 1.1~ xxxg569xxx  by 150 w
xanthine in the presence of the electron mediator phenazine
ethosulfate. in the absence of  xxxd1994xxx , the enzyme lost
less than 10%of its activity after 3 h at 37 "c. in these experiments, the enzyme was predominantly in the oxidase form.
because the enzyme can also exist as a dehydrogenase, it was
possible that properties of inhibition of the dehydrogenase activity by  xxxd1994xxx  could be different that those for inhibition of the oxidase activity. however, the rate and extent of
inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx , whichwas generated
from  xxxg2431xxx  by treatment with 10 mm dithiothreitol
at 37 "c for 1h, were similar to those observed forinhibition of
the oxidase activity. the possibility that theinhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx  was the resultof the formation
of reactive species of oxygen was eliminated by the finding that
the inhibition reaction was not affected by 75 pg/ml catalase or
2,000 unitdm1 superoxide dismutase.
the time courses for inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx  at several concentrations (fig. 1)were used to calculate the maximal value for the first-order rate constant for
inactivation (hi*) andthe concentration of  xxxd1994xxx 
which yielded the half-maximal value for this first-order rate
constant (kj the values ofk,, and ki were (1.04 0.02) x lo-'
min" and 190 f 10 w, respectively, which werecalculated by
fitting equation 1to these data. equation 1 was derived for a
two-step mechanism for inactivation of  xxxg2431xxx  in
which  xxxd1994xxx  and  xxxg2431xxx  form an initial
complex with a dissociation constant of ki which rearranges to
a tight complex with a rate constant of kinh. even though the
standard errorsassociated with ki and kinhare relatively small,
the data exhibit systemic deviations from the calculated time
courses (fig. 1).this suggested that the mechanism for inactivation of  xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx  could be more
complex than that described by equation 1. modeling of these
data to a more complex scheme is probably not warranted because the errors in the determination of the initial velocities

eluted at this time, it was not possible to obtain reliable spectra
of the products. the products released from inhibited xanthine

more hydrophilic

since the retention

(data not shown), the increased hydrophilicity
of the products is
probably not due to the introduction

inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx 
the finding that  xxxd1994xxx  binds to  xxxg2431xxx  in
the presence of allopurinol or cyanide is not inconsistent with
the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme by these inhibitors.
allopurinol inhibits xanthineoxidase after it is oxidized by the
enzyme to  xxxd2818xxx , which forms a tight complex with the
reduced form of the enzyme (22). cyanide inactivates xanthine
oxidase by effecting the release of a sulfur atom from the catalytically important molybdenum center (17, 18).because the
xanthine binding site is probably not occupied by cyanide or
allopurinol, enzyme inhibited by these inhibitors can potentially still bind  xxxd1994xxx .
since the linkage between  xxxg2431xxx  and 5-cyanouracil is disrupted by 6 m guanidine hci, it is unlikely that
inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx  involves formation of covalent intermediates such as those formed with
 xxxg652xxx  (iia inscheme i) or thymine
hydroxylase (iib inscheme i), which are relatively stable. furthermore, inactivation of  xxxg652xxx 
and thymine hydroxylase involves the net reduction or oxidation of  xxxd1994xxx , whereas one of the principal products
released from inhibited  xxxg2431xxx  by each of the methods used to dissociate inhibited enzyme is 5-acetyluracil, which
does not involve a netoxidation or reduction of  xxxd1994xxx .
thus, oxidation or reduction of  xxxd1994xxx  is probably not
involved in the inhibition reaction. 5-acetyluracil was the major product released from the inhibited enzyme after treatment
with nadh. however, other products were released by guanidine hc1 treatment or urea treatment. the product distribution depended on the method used for dissociationof the inhibited enzyme complex. these results suggest that the inhibited
enzyme complex contains an activated form of  xxxd1994xxx 
which partitions to different products depending on the method
used to dissociate the complex.
the observation that nadh restores catalytic activity t o
 xxxd1994xxx -inhibitedxanthine was unexpected. even
though these preparations of inhibited  xxxg2431xxx  have
an nadh oxidase activity, it is unlikely that reduction of the
enzyme bynadh is involved in the restoration of catalytic
activity because treatment of the inhibited enzyme with 20 nm
dithionite does not displace radiolabel from the inhibited enzyme. the basis for the efficient displacement of 5-acetyluracil
from  xxxd1994xxx -inhibitedxanthine oxidase bynadh is
unknown. nonetheless, the rapid recovery of activity by  xxxd1994xxx -inhibited  xxxg2431xxx  in the presence of nadh
makes it unlikely that  xxxd1994xxx  would be an effective
inhibitor of the enzyme in vivo.'
of the seven uracil analogues with 5-substituents tested as
inhibitors of  xxxg2431xxx , only5-ethynyluracil is a potent
inhibitor. 5-cyanouracil is a substrate for  xxxg2431xxx 
which inhibited  xxxg2431xxx  in theabsence of catalase but
is a less effective inhibitor in the presence of catalase. this
result suggested that theinhibition of the enzyme by 5-cyanouracil is due to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates
that inactivated the enzyme.consequently, 5-cyanouracil is
considered not to be a direct inhibitor of  xxxg2431xxx .
based upon the ph-independent bimolecular rate constants for
nonenzymatic addition of sulfite (table i),  xxxd1994xxx  is

the most reactive uracil analogue tested. surprisingly,  xxxd1994xxx  is soo-fold moresusceptible to nucleophilic addition
than is 5-propynyluracil.this difference in reactivity with sulfite is similar to the 500-fold greater efficiency (kinacjki)
of
 xxxd1994xxx  relative t o 5-propynyluracilas aninactivator of
 xxxg652xxx  (3).
qualitatively, the finding that  xxxd1994xxx  is the only
analogue that directly inhibited  xxxg2431xxx  is reflected in
the relative susceptibility of these uracil analogues to nucleophilic attack. for example, if the rateconstant for inhibition of
 xxxg2431xxx  wereproportional to the bimolecular rate constant for nonenzymatic addition of sulfite, ki, for 5-trifluoromethyluracil would be $ that for  xxxd1994xxx  or 0.001
min". this corresponds to a t,,, for the onset of inhibition of 10
h, which, because of the thermal instability of  xxxg2431xxx , is too long to establish experimentally that inhibition
occurs. consequently,inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  by formation of the tightcomplex with  xxxd1994xxx  could involvethe
addition of an enzymic nucleophilesuch as athiol group to the
6-position of  xxxd1994xxx  (scheme 11).if the resulting allene
were protected from enzymicand endogenous nucleophiles,the
reaction would be interrupted at this stage. dissociation of the
inhibited enzyme by denaturation or nadh treatment could
then result inhydration of the allene or hydrolysis of the dihydropyrimidine ring to 5-acetyluracil or other hydrophilic products (scheme 11).
in summary, the results presented herein havedemonstrated that  xxxd1994xxx  is a potent inhibitor of rat liver
 xxxg2431xxx .  xxxd1994xxx  is not linked to xanthine
oxidase through a stablecovalent bond. however,
disruption of
of the enzyme-inhibitor complex does notlead to the release of
 xxxd1994xxx . consequently,  xxxd1994xxx  is probably
linked to  xxxg2431xxx  through a labile covalent bond that
activates  xxxd1994xxx  for other types of chemistry which
occurwhen the enzyme-inhibitor complex is disrupted. the
inhibition of  xxxg2431xxx  by  xxxd1994xxx  is another
example of the intrinsic reactivity of this molecule in which
 xxxd1994xxx  is probably functioning as an affinity label of
propitiously arranged nucleophilic residues.

potent inhibitors of  xxxg2431xxx , such as allopurinol, enhance
the incorporation of radiolabeled
xanthine into liverrna bypreventing
the oxidation of xanthine to urate (26). thus,the specific activity of liver
rna from mice dosedwith allopurinol priorto administrationof radiolabeled xanthine is increased 20-foldrelative to that of controlanimals.
 xxxd1994xxx ,dosed at 100 mgkg for 7 days prior to administration
of radiolabeled xanthine, did not enhance the specific activity of rna
relative to that of control animals. consequently, 5-ethynyluracilis an
ineffective inhibitor of  xxxg2431xxx  in vivo (d. nelson andc.
lambe, unpublished results).
