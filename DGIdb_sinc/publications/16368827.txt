gabapentin is a novel analgesic whose mechanism of
action is not known. we investigated in a postoperative
pain model whether  xxxd83xxx  (atp)sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels, n-methyl-d- xxxd233xxx 
(nmda) receptors, and ca2⫹ channels are involved in
the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin. mechanical allodynia was induced by a paw incision in
isoflurane-anesthetized rats. withdrawal thresholds to
von frey filament stimulation near the incision site
were measured before and after incision and after intrathecal drug administration. the antiallodynic effect of
gabapentin (100 ␮g) was not affected by intrathecal pretreatment with antagonists of katp channels, nmda
receptors or gamma- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)a receptors.  xxxg1253xxx  openers and gabaa receptor ag-

abapentin, a ␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) analog, was developed as a brain-penetrating anticonvulsant (1). it is also an analgesic for postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal
neuralgia, and migraine prophylaxis (2). the mechanism of action of gabapentin remains unclear, although several targets have been proposed.
 xxxd83xxx -sensitive k⫹ (katp) channels were found to be involved in gabapentin-induced
inhibition of [3h]-noradrenaline release in rat hippocampal slices (3). in the spinal cord, katp channels
were implicated in the antinociceptive effects of

onist, per se, had little effect on the postincision allodynic response. the ca2⫹ channel blocker of n-type
(␻-conotoxin gvia, 0.1–3 ␮g), but not of p/q-type
(␻-agatoxin iva), l-type (verapamil, diltiazem or  xxxd2728xxx ), or t-type ( xxxd2638xxx ), attenuated the
incision-induced allodynia, as did gabapentin. both the
antiallodynic effects of gabapentin and ␻-conotoxin
gvia were attenuated by bay k 8644, an l-type ca2⫹
channel activator. these results provide correlative
evidence to support the contention that n-type ca2⫹
channels, but not katp channels or nmda or gabaa
receptors, might be involved in the antiallodynic effect
of intrathecal gabapentin.

morphine and norepinephrine in the tail-flick test
(4), as were pinacidil, a  xxxg1253xxx  opener, and
gabapentin in a nerve ligation neuropathic pain
model (5). we have demonstrated that intrathecal
injection of gabapentin induced an antiallodynic effect in the brennan postoperative pain model (6). in
this study, we examined whether spinal katp channels
are involved in this pain model and if intrathecal gabapentin induces an antiallodynic effect through opening
these katp channels.
gabapentin was also found to increase n-methyld- xxxd233xxx  (nmda) current in gabaergic, but
not non-gabaergic, spinal dorsal horn neurons in
inflamed rats (7). therefore, it is possible that the
analgesic effect of intrathecal gabapentin might be
attributed to this enhancement of nmda current in
spinal gabaergic neurons. the present study also
validated this possibility by investigating the interactions of nmda and gabaa receptor blockers
with gabapentin in the postoperative pain model.
a specific binding site of gabapentin in the brain
was found to be the ␣2␦ subunit, the auxiliary subunit,
of voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels (8). in neuropathic pain models, the ca2⫹ channel ␣2␦ subunit has

been implicated in the antinociceptive actions of gabapentin and its analogues (9). in the postoperative pain
model, we have shown that the ␣2␦ subunit of ca2⫹
channels might also be involved in the antiallodynic
effect of intrathecal gabapentin (6) because the effect
of gabapentin was attenuated by mgcl2 and ruthenium red, the modulators of gabapentin binding at the
ca2⫹ channel ␣2␦ subunit. in the spinal cord, p/q-, n-,
l-, and t-types ca2⫹ channels are present and functional (10). the present study further examined which
type of ca2⫹ channel blockers would mimic the antiallodynic effect of gabapentin when administered intrathecally. the interaction of the l-type ca2⫹ channel
activator bay k 8644 with gabapentin was also investigated.

methods
all experiments conformed to the guidelines of and
were approved by the institutional laboratory animal
care committee of mackay memorial hospital and
college of medicine, national taiwan university, taipei, taiwan.
the intrathecal catheterization, paw incision surgery and analysis of allodynic responses are similar
to our previous report (6). briefly, under isoflurane
anesthesia, male sprague-dawley rats (250 –300 g)
received intrathecal catheterization via a pe-5 catheter advanced to the lumbar enlargement of the
spinal cord. five days after catheterization, a 1-cm
longitudinal incision on the plantar surface of the
rat right hindpaw was made and the plantaris muscle was elevated and incised longitudinally to
induce postoperative allodynia. the allodynic responses were evaluated by the withdrawal thresholds to punctate mechanical stimuli induced by calibrated von frey filaments with logarithmically
incremental stiffness from 0.6 to 60 g (stoelting co,
wood dale, il). beginning with the 6.0-g probe, the
filament was applied vertically to the area adjacent
to the incision wound for 6 s while the filament was
bent. brisk withdrawal or paw flinching was considered as a positive response. if a positive response
was observed, the filament with the next lower force
was applied; otherwise, the next stiffer filament was
used. the stimulus producing a 50% likelihood
withdrawal was determined using the dixon “upand-down” method. rats with postincision withdrawal thresholds ⬍5 g were considered to have
marked allodynia and were used in the present
study. the withdrawal thresholds were measured
before and 2 h after paw incision and every 5 to 30
min for 2 h after intrathecal treatment.
a drug-induced antiallodynic effect was expressed
as the percentage of maximal possible effect (%mpe)
as follows:

the mean withdrawal thresholds of 229 tested rats
before and after incision were 45.6 ⫾ 1.1 g and 1.5 ⫾
0.1 g, respectively.
all drugs were injected intrathecally in a volume of
5 ␮l followed by a 10 ␮l normal saline flush. the
receptor or channel ligands were pretreated 10 min
before gabapentin was administered. the von frey
filament testing was conducted 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and
120 min after drug administrations. for the l-type
ca2⫹ channel blockers, the testing was conducted earlier and more frequently (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 90, and
120 min) because they induced antinociception 5 min
after intrathecal injection in tail-flick and colorectal
distension tests (11). rats showing any sign of motor
dysfunction, including abnormal ambulation or
placing/stepping reflex after drug injections, were excluded from the study.
drugs were dissolved in normal saline, except for
pinacidil,  xxxd1868xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd2728xxx ,
which were dissolved in 20% dimethylsulfoxide
(dmso). pinacidil,  xxxd1868xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , 2-amino5-phosphonovaleric acid (apv), (⫹)-5-methyl-10,11dihydro-5h-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine (mk801), isoguvacine hydrochloride, bicuculline

the former was used in constructing its dose-response
curve and the latter was used in its interaction with
bay k 8644. gabapentin was a generous gift from
pfizer (groton, ct, usa).

results
as reported previously (6), intrathecal gabapentin
dose-dependently reduced the incision-induced allodynic response in the rat model of postoperative pain.
a median effective dose of gabapentin, 100 ␮g, was
used to examine its interactions with the receptor or
channel ligands. the antiallodynic effect of 100 ␮g
gabapentin peaked at approximately 45-60 min after
intrathecal injection and lasted for more than 2 h (figs.
1 and 2). in the same model, whiteside et al. (12)
found that intraperitoneal injection of gabapentin produced only 19% antiallodynic effect at the largest
dose, 100 mg/kg. it seems that increased efficacy can
be achieved for gabapentin via intrathecal administration.
intrathecal  xxxd2215xxx , a  xxxg1253xxx  blocker,
at the dose of 300 ␮g, neither affected the incisioninduced allodynic response per se (fig. 1) nor the antiallodynic effect of 100 ␮g gabapentin ( fig. 1). the
 xxxg1253xxx  opener, pinacidil, at doses of 100 and
300 ␮g, also did not affect the postincision allodynic
responses (fig. 1). when  xxxd1868xxx , another katp
channel opener more selective to neuronal type of
katp channels (13), was administered, no antiallodynic effect was observed at doses of 600 ␮g or
1200 ␮g (fig. 1). the vehicle dmso alone (20%) did
not affect the allodynic response (peak antiallodynic

effect: 1.4% ⫾ 0.6%mpe, n ⫽ 6). because no antiallodynic or marked toxic effect was observed after these
 xxxg1253xxx  ligands were administered, their effectiveness was further verified using aortic ring bioassay. both pinacidil and  xxxd1868xxx  inhibited high k⫹induced aortic ring contraction and  xxxd2215xxx 
reversed their aortic ring relaxant effects (chiao and
su, unpublished observations).
to validate the hypothesis raised by the finding of
gu and huang (7) (that intrathecal gabapentin exerts
an antiallodynic effect by enhancing the nmda current of spinal gabaergic neurons), the effects of antagonists of nmda or gabaa receptors on the antiallodynic effect of gabapentin were examined.
intrathecal injection of 6 ␮g apv, the binding site
blocker of nmda receptors, slightly reduced the allodynic response for approximately 30 min (fig. 2a).
similarly, intrathecal injection of 14 ␮g of mk-801, the
nmda receptor channel blocker, also produced little
antiallodynic effect (fig. 2b). increasing the dose of
apv to 12 ␮g and that of mk-801 to 28 ␮g induced
motor weakness in the rats. pretreatment with 6 ␮g
apv (fig. 2a) or 14 ␮g mk-801 (fig. 2b) did not
attenuate the antiallodynic effect of gabapentin. on
the contrary, a slight additive antiallodynic effect,
though statistically insignificant, was observed in the

first 30 min after intrathecal injection of gabapentin in
the apv- or mk-801-pretreated group (fig. 2a, b).
bicuculline, at 0.3 ␮g, did not affect the postincision
allodynic response nor the antiallodynic effect of 100
␮g gabapentin (fig. 2c). when we increased the dose
of bicuculline to 3 ␮g, the agitated rats squeaked and
jumped, which hampered further assessment of this
drug. similarly, isoguvacine, a gabaa receptor agonist, when given intrathecally at 20 ␮g, had little antiallodynic effect as well (fig. 2c). increasing the dose
of isoguvacine to 30 ␮g or larger resulted in motor
weakness.
intrathecal injection of ctx-gvia, an n-type ca2⫹
channel blocker, significantly attenuated the incisioninduced allodynic response in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 3). however, toxic signs, such as agitation,
squeaking, tremor, ataxia, and segmental allodynia in
response to fur brushing at the hind body, also appeared dose-dependently as described in previous
studies (14,15). when the dose of ctx-gvia was
larger than 3 ␮g, the toxic signs were too severe to
evaluate its antiallodynic effect. the ed50 of ctxgvia estimated from the dose-response curve is 0.24
⫾ 0.14 ␮g (fig. 3b).
on the contrary, the postincision allodynia was not
affected by intrathecal injection of l-type ca2⫹ channel blockers (verapamil 300 ␮g, diltiazem 500 ␮g, or
 xxxd2728xxx  500 ␮g), t-type ca2⫹ channel blocker ( xxxd2638xxx  600 ␮g), or p/q-type ca2⫹ channel blocker
(aga-iva 0.1 or 0.3 ␮g) (table 1). increasing the
doses of diltiazem to 1000 ␮g,  xxxd2728xxx  to 1000 ␮g
and  xxxd2638xxx  to 1200 ␮g produced motor weakness
that confounded the evaluation of their possible antiallodynic responses. severe agitation was also noted
when the dose of aga-iva was increased to more
than 0.3 ␮g.

all types of ca2⫹ channels consist of ␣2␦ subunit,
the binding site of gabapentin in the brain (8). however, only the n-type ca2⫹ channel blocker could
mimic the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin. because no selective n-type ca2⫹ channel activator is available and because the l-type ca2⫹ channel
has been reported to be the possible target of gabapentin (16), we examined whether bay k 8644, a selective l-type ca2⫹ channel activator, could affect the
antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin. unexpectedly, intrathecal pretreatment with 5 ␮g bay k
8644 attenuated the antiallodynic effect of gabapentin
(fig. 4a). bay k 8644 5 ␮g, per se, has no effect on the
incision-induced allodynic response (fig. 4a). interestingly, bay k 8644 (5 ␮g) also attenuated the antiallodynic effect of n-type ca2⫹ channel blocker, ctxgvia (1 ␮g) (fig. 4b). the different potencies of 1 ␮g
ctx-gvia shown in figures 3 and 4 might be a result
of the different batches of ctx-gvia we used.

discussion
in the present study we found that intrathecal injection of the blockers of katp channels, nmda receptors, and gabaa receptors failed to attenuate the
antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin in a rat
model of postoperative pain. the  xxxg1253xxx  openers and gabaa receptor agonist, per se, did not affect
the incision-induced allodynia. on the other hand,
intrathecal injection of ctx-gvia, an n-type ca2⫹
channel blocker, produced a dose-dependent attenuation of postincision allodynia, as did gabapentin.
however, the blockers of p/q-, l-, and t-type ca2⫹
channels had no effect on the postincision allodynia.
both the antiallodynic effects of gabapentin and ctxgvia were reversed by bay k 8644, an l-type ca2⫹
channel activator. we suggest that katp channels,

nmda, and gabaa receptors might not be the action
target of the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin in the postoperative pain model. in addition,
this study provides correlative evidence to support the
contention that n-type ca2⫹ channels might be involved in the effect of gabapentin.
katp channels have been suggested to be involved
in the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal morphine,
norepinephrine, and pinacidil in the tail-flick test and
nerve ligation pain model (4,5). however, in the current postoperative pain model, neither the opener nor
the blocker of katp channels affects the incisioninduced allodynic response. we suggest that katp
channels are not involved in this postoperative pain
model, although they might be involved in the acute
thermal and/or neuropathic pain models.
our finding that  xxxd2215xxx  failed to reverse the
antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin suggests
that gabapentin is unlikely to act as a  xxxg1253xxx 
opener to exert its antiallodynic effect in the current
postoperative pain model, unlike in the nerve ligation
model (5). this result is in agreement with the finding
that gabapentin did not modulate katp currents in
primary afferent neurons (17).
gu and huang (7) found that gabapentin enhances
nmda currents selectively in the gabaergic neurons
of spinal dorsal horn in inflamed rats. it is therefore
possible that intrathecal gabapentin induced an antinociceptive response through selective activation of
the inhibitory gabaergic neurons in the spinal cord.
however, this possibility is negated by the ineffectiveness of the receptor antagonists of nmda and
gabaa, at the doses effective in other pain models
(18,19), in reversing the antiallodynic effect of gabapentin in the current postoperative pain model. gabab
receptor antagonists were also found to be ineffective
in reversing the antinociceptive effects of gabapentin
in neuropathic and postoperative pain models (20).
the ineffectiveness of isoguvacine, a gabaa receptor agonist, in the current model suggests that spinal

anesth analg
2006;102:182–7

gabaa receptors, unlike gabab receptors (20), are
not potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of
postoperative pain. on the other hand, in the nerve
ligation pain model, both gabaa and  xxxg828xxx  agonists had antinociceptive effects (18).
the intrathecal concentrations of all types of ca2⫹
channel blockers used in this study, estimated by assuming the cerebrospinal fluid volume of adult rats is
about 400 ␮l (6), are effective in blocking the ca2⫹
channels of isolated spinal cord slices (10). however,
only n-type ca2⫹ channel blockers display an antiallodynic effect, suggesting that blockade of spinal
n-type, but not p/q-, l-, or t-type, ca2⫹ channels
could produce antiallodynic action in the current postoperative pain model.
gabapentin was found to bind specifically to the
ca2⫹ channel ␣2␦ subunit, which is the auxiliary subunit of voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels (8). in dorsal
root ganglion neurons, gabapentin was found to reduce ca2⫹ influx predominantly through n-type ca2⫹
channels (21). therefore, n-type ca2⫹ channels might
be involved in the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal
gabapentin in the current postoperative pain model.
no selective n-type ca2⫹ channel opener is available for testing the potential ability to reverse the
effect of gabapentin. however, bay k 8644, a selective
l-type ca2⫹ channel opener, unexpectedly reversed
the antiallodynic effect of gabapentin. although gabapentin was reported to reduce the ca2⫹ current sensitivity to bay k 8644 in cortical neurons (16), it is
unlikely that the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal
gabapentin is mediated via l-type ca2⫹ channels.
first, l-type ca2⫹ channel blockers did not show any
antiallodynic effect in the present study. second, bay
k 8644 also reversed the effect of ctx-gvia, a ca2⫹
channel blocker selective to the n-type (22). the reason that bay k 8644 reversed the antiallodynic effect of
gabapentin and ctx-gvia is unclear. it might be that
bay k 8644 increased ca2⫹ influx through l-type ca2⫹
channels to indirectly counteract the inhibition of
n-type ca2⫹ channels induced by gabapentin or ctxgvia. bay k 8644 has been reported to enhance catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells
through l-type ca2⫹ channels (23). however, the
nerve-stimulation-evoked catecholamine releases in
these preparations is mostly mediated by n-type ca2⫹
channels (23).
in addition to the present postoperative pain model,
n-type ca2⫹ channel blockers have also been shown
to have analgesic effects, as has gabapentin (1), in
neuropathic (14) and inflammatory (15) pain models.
however, the side effects such as tremor and ataxia
induced by ctx-gvia were not observed with intrathecal gabapentin administration. this discrepancy
might be because gabapentin and ctx-gvia act at
different sites of ca2⫹ channels. instead of binding to
the pore-forming ␣1 subunit, as the ca2⫹ channel

anesth analg
2006;102:182–7

blockers do, gabapentin might act at the ␣2␦ auxiliary
subunit (8).
upregulation of spinal dorsal horn ␣2␦-1 subunit of
ca2⫹ channels has been noted in gabapentin-sensitive,
but not in insensitive, pain models (24). it remains to
be elucidated whether the ␣2␦ subunit is also upregulated in the current postoperative pain model. our
previous study inferred that the ␣2␦ subunit might be
involved in the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin in this model (6). this inference is further supported by the recent finding of cox et al. (25) that
pregabalin, a gabapentin analog, also with ␣2␦ binding
activity, fails to induce antinociception in transgenic
mice, in which the critical binding site for gabapentin
at the ␣2 subunit of ca2⫹ channels was mutated
(arg217 ¡ ala217). the present study further provides
correlative evidence supporting the notion that the ␣2␦
subunit of n-type ca2⫹ channels might be the antiallodynic action target of gabapentin in the postoperative pain model. nevertheless, gabapentin might exert
its other central nervous system effects, such as antiepilepsy or anxiolysis (1), by acting at the targets other
than n-type ca2⫹ channels.
in conclusion, our findings suggest that the antiallodynic effect of intrathecal gabapentin in the postoperative pain model is not mediated through katp
channels, nmda, or gabaa receptors. in addition,
this behavioral study provides correlative evidence to
support the contention that spinal n-type ca2⫹ channels might be involved in the antiallodynic effect of
gabapentin.
