abstract
carbonic-anhydrase (ca) inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis
( xxxg310xxx ) and related channelopathies but their mechanism of action is unknown. patch-clamp
experiments and molecular modeling investigations were performed to evaluate the mechanism of
actions of ca inhibitors on skeletal muscle ca2+-activated-k+ (bk) channel of k+-deficient rats
used as animal model of  xxxg310xxx . ca inhibitors showing different degree of ca inhibition such as
acetazolamide (actz),  xxxd1872xxx  (dcp),  xxxd2294xxx  (hct),  xxxd2058xxx  (etx),
 xxxd2592xxx  (mtz), and  xxxd299xxx  (bft), which lacks inhibitory effects on ca
enzymes, were tested in vitro on bk channels. the application of actz, bft, etx, and dcp to excised
patches
activated

actz(de50=7.3x10 m)>bft(de50=5.93x10 m)>etx(de50=1.17x10 m)>>dcp. in contrast, mtz
and hct failed to activate the  xxxg1259xxx . molecular modeling studies showed that the capability of ca
inhibitors to open the  xxxg1259xxx  was related to the presence in their structures of an intramolecular hydrogen bond with calculated inter-atomic distances ranging between 1.82 a° and 3.01
a° and of an aromatic ring poor of electrons. actz, bft, etx, and dcp showed these
pharmacofores, while mtz and hct did not. our data indicate that the activation of  xxxg1259xxx  is
a property of ca inhibitors that interact with the channel subunit/s and that this effect is not related
to their capability to inhibit the ca enzymes.

c

alcium-activated k+-channel (bk) is a class of k+ channels widely distributed in various
tissues involved in different cellular functions such as reduction of excitability during
repetitive and high frequency stimulation of the cells, controls of neurotransmitter release,
controls of muscle tone, and regulation of k+ ions homeostasis (1-3). in skeletal muscle, the
opening of  xxxg1259xxx  is triggered by cellular depolarization, intracellular ca2+ ions, and pka
phosphorylation and increases the duration of the hyperpolarization phase between bursts of action
potentials reducing the firing capability and buffering the accumulation of intracellular ca2+ ions (45). enhancement of  xxxg1259xxx  activity has been observed during ischemia-reperfusion of skeletal
muscle that is associated to hyperkalaemia (6).
the  xxxg1259xxx  is composed by an alpha-subunit assembled as tetramer and a transmembrane betasubunit. molecular biology investigations identified an asp-rich sequence motif in the tail domain
(cooh-terminal sequence) of the alpha-subunit of the drosophila  xxxg1259xxx  as binding site for ca2+
ions called bowl region. the ca2+ ions act by an allosteric mechanism that involves the binding of

the ions to this region with a stoichiometry of at least two sites per monomer and favoring the
transition of the channel from closed to open state (7).
the bk openers comprise a large series of cyclic benzimidazolones such as ns004 and ns1619,
the biaryl amines such as the anti-inflammatory drugs  xxxd2723xxx ,  xxxd2556xxx  and flufenamic
acids known for their inhibitory action on cl- channels, the biarylureas, the pyridyl amines, and the
cromakalim (8). more recently, structure-activity investigations identified the 3-aryloxindoles,
diphenyltriazoles, and aryl-aminoquinolines mostly designed on the basis of the benzimidazolones
structure as new classes of bk openers (9-12). these molecules were developed as antihypertensive agents, neuroprotective agents against stroke, bladder relaxants, anti-convulsive, and
anti-asthmatic compounds. however, none of these compounds is available on the market for
clinical uses.
we have shown that acetazolamide (actz), a well-known carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitor is
capable to activate in vitro in isolated membrane patches the  xxxg1259xxx  of skeletal muscle (13).
the effects of actz were voltage dependent and ca2+ dependent, being more effective at negative
membrane potentials and in the presence of intracellular ca2+ ions. we proposed that these effects
were due to a direct interaction of the drug with the channel subunits without the involvement of
ca enzymes.
actz and  xxxd1872xxx  (dcp), another known ca inhibitor, are clinically used to treat
several neuromuscular disorders. these drugs are also the most common medications in familial
hypokalemic periodic paralysis ( xxxg310xxx ), which is a familial autosomal disorder mostly caused by
a loss-of-function mutations of  xxxg310xxx  gene ( xxxg310xxx -1) encoding for the alpha1-subunit of
skeletal muscle l-type ca2+ channel (14-16). in a small number of families not carrying the l-type
ca2+ channel mutations,  xxxg310xxx  is caused by mutations of  xxxg2026xxx  ( xxxg310xxx -2) coding for the alphasubunit of the muscle voltage-gated na+ channel (14, 16). although these mutations account for
some symptoms of  xxxg310xxx , it is still not easy to explain the low plasma k+ level or the muscle fiber
depolarization induced by insulin, which characterizes all  xxxg310xxx  types.
actz is also effective in preventing the characteristic symptoms of  xxxg310xxx  in k+-deficient rats, a
nongenetic model of  xxxg310xxx  commonly used to gain inside the aetiopathogenesis of the disease.
these rats indeed show most of the characteristic signs of the human disorder including the insulininduced fiber depolarization and paralysis and the hypokalaemia (13, 17). deficiency of
sarcolemma atp-sensitive k+ (katp) channel has been found in both human  xxxg310xxx  as
demonstrated in  xxxg310xxx  patients type 1 and in k+-deficient rats possibly explaining the similar
phenotype (17-18). we demonstrated that the beneficial effects of actz in k+-deficient rats were
due to activation of the muscle  xxxg1259xxx  (13). however, whether other sulphonamide drugs
belonging to the class of the ca inhibitors are also capable to open the  xxxg1259xxx  is currently
unknown.
in the present work, patch-clamp experiments were performed to evaluate the in vitro effects of
classical sulphonamide drugs showing different degree of ca inhibition such as dcp,
 xxxd2592xxx  (mtz),  xxxd2058xxx  (etx),  xxxd2294xxx  (hct), and  xxxd299xxx 
(bft), which lacks inhibitory effect on ca enzymes, on skeletal muscle bk channels of k+deficient rats.
molecular modeling studies were also performed to investigate the chemical structural
characteristics required for the activation of the  xxxg1259xxx  by ca inhibitors in our system. this
also helped to gain inside the mechanism of interactions of ca inhibitors with the muscle bk
channels.

materials and methods
drugs
the compounds under investigations were actz, dcp, mtz, etx, hct, and bft (sigma
chemical co.). these compounds were selected on the basis of their capability to inhibit the diverse
forms of ca enzymes. it has been shown that the order of potency as ca inhibitors is
dcp>mtz>actz≥etx>hct with bft lacking inhibitory effects on ca enzymes (19-21).
rat housing and diet
adult male wistar rats (260-300 g) were used for the experiments. the animal care was performed
in accordance to the guide for care and use of laboratory animals prepared by the national
academy of sciences. the rats were fed with 30 g of pellets/day based on different recipes for 23
days of treatment. the k+-deficient rats (n° rats=10) were obtained by feeding the rats with a
special food free of k+ ion. blood samples were collected from the tail vein of the animals at the
beginning of the treatment. at the time of death, intracardiac blood samples were collected from the
rats after an overnight fast for the evaluation of serum k+ concentrations. the rats were considered
hypokalaemic when the serum k+ concentration was <3.2 meq/l. as previously shown, ≥18 days of
treatment were needed to induce measurable hypokalaemia in the rats (17).
the drug experiments were performed on k+-deficient rats for different reasons. first, the muscle
fibers of these rats contain a large  xxxg1259xxx  current with similar sensitivity to actz as compared
with that recorded in the normokalaemic rat fibers (13). second, the k+-deficient rat fibers lack
 xxxg1253xxx  activity that would interfere in the recordings of  xxxg1259xxx  currents in particular at
negative membrane potentials. moreover, the k+-deficient rats reproduce most of the abnormalities
of the human disorders, making them a helpful system to test the drug effects.
spectrophotometry
standard flame spectrophotometry (corning.eel 450 flame photometer) was used for detection of
the serum k+ levels. the values were expressed as meq/l of ions.
muscle preparations and single fiber isolation
the flexor digitorum brevis (fdb) muscles were dissected from the animals under urethane
anesthesia (1.2 g/kg). after dissection, the animals were rapidly killed with an overdose of urethane
according to the guide for care and use of laboratory animals prepared by the national academy
of sciences. single muscle fibers were prepared from fdb muscles by enzymatic dissociation in
normal ringer solution of the following composition (10−3m): 145 nacl, 5 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 0.5
cacl2, 5 glucose, 10 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic sodium salt (mops), ph = 7.2 with mops
acid, and enriched with 3 mg/ml of collagenase type xi-s (sigma chemical co.)
patch clamp experiments
experiments were performed in the inside-out patch configuration using standard patch-clamp
techniques. the  xxxg1259xxx  current was recorded at 20°c and sampled at 1 khz (filter=0.2 khz)
using an axopatch-1d amplifier equipped with a cv-4 headstage (axon instruments, foster city,
ca) during voltage steps of 10 s going from 0 mv of holding potential to –60 mv (vm) and +30
mv (vm) in the presence of 10x10−6m concentration of free ca2+ ions in the bath solution. at this
concentration, any residual activity of  xxxg1253xxx  present in the macropatches was abolished .

current analysis was performed by using pclamp 6 software package (axon instruments). the bk
currents were calculated by digital subtraction of the leak currents measured in the absence of
internal ca2+ ions from the maximal open channel currents recorded in the presence of internal 10 x
10−6 m concentrations of free ca2+ ions for each patch, respectively. the resulting bk currents were
digitally averaged. the criteria for accepting the data entering in the digital average were based on
the stability of the seal evaluated by observing the noise levels not exceeding 0.6 pa at 2 khz. no
correction for liquid junction potentials was made, which were estimated to be <1.9 mv under our
experimental conditions.
2

pipettes having an average tip opening area of 5.8 ± 0.5 µm (n° macropatches=70) were used to
measure the currents sustained by multiple k+ channels and the pharmacological properties in the
k+-deficient rats. the pipette area was calculated as described previously (13). the pipette
(extracellular) solution contained (10−3m): 150 kcl, 2 cacl2, 10 mops, ph=7.2 with mops acid.
the bath solution contained (mm): 150 kcl, 5 ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n, n, n, ntetraacetic acid (egta), 10 mops sodium salt, ph= 7.2 with mops acid. cacl2 was added to the
bath solution to a give free ca2+ ions concentration of 10 x 10−6 m. the calculation of the free ca2+
ions concentration in the bath was performed as described previously (6, 22).
stock solutions of the drugs under investigation were prepared dissolving the drugs in
dimethylsulphoxide (dmso) at concentrations of 20 x 10−3 m. microliter amounts of the stock
solutions were then added to the bath solutions as needed. the effects of the drugs on the bk
channel were evaluated in the presence or absence of 10 x 10−6 m concentration of free ca2+ ions in
the bath.
the concentration-response relationships of the ca inhibitors tested could be fitted with the
following equation: (i drug+ca2+ -1)*100 = e /(1+(de50 /[drug])n), where i drug+ca2+ is the bk
current recorded in the presence of drugs and in the presence of internal ca2+ ions; e is the
activation of the current caused by the drug; de50 is the concentration of the drug needed to
enhance the current by 50%; [drug] is the concentration of the drug tested; n is the slope of the
curves. the algorithms of the fitting procedures used were based on marquardt least squares fitting
routine. the data are expressed as means ± se.
logp, logd, and pka calculations
the relationships between the lipophilicity and the biological activity of the ca inhibitors tested
here were evaluated by calculating the logp and logd at ph 7, defined as logarithm of the
octanol/water partition coefficient and logarithm of the distribution coefficient at a particular ph,
respectively. the degree of ionization of the molecules was evaluated by calculating the pka value
defined as the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant. theoretical logp, logd, and pka
values were calculated by using acd software v6.0 (advanced chemistry development inc.,
toronto, ontario, canada).
modeling study
we first searched the lower energy conformers for each drug by a systematic force field analysis. a
low number of conformers have been found for each compound mostly due to their planar structure.
when available, as in the case of actz, hct, and mtz molecules, the geometric parameters used
for the conformer analysis were derived from x-ray data from ccdb (cambridge crystallographic
data-base). for those compounds for which x-ray data were not available, the molecules were first
constructed by fragments then submitted for further calculations. the lower energy conformers
found having intramolecular hydrogen bonding capacity were selected and submitted to a geometry

optimization and energy calculations by hartree-fock calculations at the 3-21g(*) level. the
electrostatic potentials of the selected conformers were also calculated. energies were corrected for
aqueous solvation by using the cramer-truhler sm 5.4 model (23). all calculations and graphical
representations were performed by using the spartan unix 5.1 software package (wavefunction
inc. irvine, ca) and by ds viewerpro 5.0 software (accelry inc.). the blue color in the graphical
representation of the molecules indicates area poor of electrons, while red color indicates area
electron reach.
results
effects of ca inhibitors on bk channels of skeletal muscle fibers of k+-deficient rats
as previously shown, actz opened the skeletal muscle  xxxg1259xxx  of k+-deficient rats in excised
patches, at –60 mv and +30 mv (vm), in the presence of 10 x 10−6 m concentration of free ca2+
ions in the bath being more effective at negative voltages (fig. 1) (13). actz had a de50 of 7.3 x
10−6 m, at –60 mv (vm) with a maximal stimulatory response of 104%.
we found that the sulphonamide derivatives bft, etx, and dcp were also capable to open the
muscle bk channels of k+-deficient rats but with different efficacy. channel activation was
observed in excised patches, at –60 mv (vm), in the presence of 10 x1 0−6 m concentration of free
ca2+ ions in the bath with all these drugs (fig. 1). the stimulatory effects of bft and etx were
dose dependent. bft and etx fully activated the  xxxg1259xxx  with a calculated de50 of 5.93 x 10−5
m (slope=1) and 1.17 x 10−4 m (slope=1.3) and a maximal stimulatory response of 128% and
116%, respectively (fig. 2a), whereas dcp had a reduced maximal stimulatory response of 29%
(fig. 2a). these drugs did not activate the  xxxg1259xxx  in the absence of internal ca2+ ions and were
ineffective at +30 mv (vm) (fig. 1).
mtz and hct, in the range of concentrations tested, failed to activate the muscle bk channels at
all voltage tested and in the presence of internal ca2+ ions (fig. 1 and fig. 2a).
no correlations between the pharmacological actions of the ca inhibitors and their physiochemical
properties such as the logp, logd at ph 7, and pka values of the molecules under investigations
were found.
modeling study
molecular modeling studies showed that actz can exist in a tautomeric form (imide) having
calculated energy levels equivalent to that of the other corresponding conformers. the imide of
actz is favored in our conditions in respect to the other conformers being stabilized by ca2+ ions,
which are present in our bath solutions. in fact, it is known that the tautomeric forms of the
molecules are stabilized by divalent ions (24). the imide of actz formed a stable intramolecular
hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of the thiadiazol ring with a calculated inter-atomic distance
of 1.82 a° (fig. 2b).
similarly, the lower energy conformers of bft, etx, mtz, and dcp can form intra-molecular
hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen atoms of their sulphonamide moieties and the fluorine,
nitrogen, and chlorine atoms with calculated inter-atomic distances of 2.19 a°, 2.94 a°, 3.01 a°,
and 3.01 a°, respectively (fig. 2b), whereas hct formed an intramolecular hydrogen bond
between the hydrogen atoms of the sulphonamide moiety and the chlorine atom of the ring but with
calculated inter-atomic distances of 3.10 a°, which are higher than those calculated for the other
ca inhibitors (fig. 2b).

the electrostatic potentials calculations performed by hartree-fock at the 3-21g(*) level showed
that all the compounds under investigation had a common planar area constituted by an aromatic
ring more or less poor of electrons with the exception of the mtz molecule who lost the
aromaticity (fig. 2b).
discussion
ca inhibitors open the skeletal muscle  xxxg1259xxx 
in the present work, we evaluated the possible interaction of ca inhibitors with  xxxg1259xxx  of
skeletal muscle. we confirmed that actz is capable to activate in isolated membrane patches and
in the absence of intracellular modulators the bk channels of skeletal muscle of k+-deficient rats
(13). the mechanism by which actz activates the  xxxg1259xxx  is voltage and ca2+ dependent as
demonstrated by the fact that this drug was more effective at negative membrane potential but failed
to activate the  xxxg1259xxx  in the absence of internal ca2+ ions.
we showed here that also etx, dcp, and bft, which lacks inhibitory effects on ca enzymes,
were capable to open in vitro the  xxxg1259xxx  in isolated membrane patches without the
involvement of intracellular factors that are lost after patch excision. in our hands, the order of
potency as bk agonists comparing the calculated de50 values evaluated at negative membrane
potential was actz>bft>etx>>dcp.
the finding that bft and etx were more effective than actz at the higher concentrations tested
in enhancing the maximal  xxxg1259xxx  currents suggests that their mechanisms are complex
involving multiple actions. for example, these drugs could be also capable to recruit silent channels
present in the isolated membrane patches increasing the number of functional channels, whereas
dcp showed a typical concentration-response curve of a partial agonist with a reduced maximal bk
channel current at the higher concentrations tested.
as observed for actz, the effects of etx, bft, and dcp were ca2+ dependent being effective
exclusively in the presence of internal ca2+ ions. however, the voltage dependence of the effects of
bft, etx, and dcp on bk channels was more pronounced than that observed for actz
suggesting a different mode of action.
modeling study and interaction of ca inhibitors with muscle  xxxg1259xxx 
modeling investigations were therefore performed to explain the actions of these drugs on bk
channels. our strategy was to search for the existence of the intra-molecular hydrogen bond and of
a planar area poor of electrons represented by at least one aromatic ring linked to electron
withdrawing groups. these are in fact the minimal structural requisites critical in determining the
 xxxg1259xxx  opener properties in several synthetic and natural compounds (8-11).
we found that all the compounds effective as  xxxg1259xxx  openers such as actz, bft, etx, and
dcp showed an intramolecular hydrogen bond with inter-atomic distances ranging between 1.82 a°
and 3.01 a° and an aromatic ring poor of electrons. the lack of one of these two characteristics led
to inactive compounds as observed for mtz and hct molecules. in fact the mtz lost the
aromaticity and hct showed an inter-atomic distance of the hydrogen bond >3.01 a°.
the fitting of the molecules by comparing their spatial geometry and the electrostatic potential
profiles revealed that actz, bft, and etx shared a common area of electrostatic potentials with
that of the ns-004 molecule, which is one of the best bk openers investigated until now (8; fig. 3).
in all these molecules including the ns-004, three negatively charged areas and one positively
charged can be identified. these areas can represent point of interactions with complementary sites

on the receptor that can show at least three positively charged and one negatively charged residues
available for drug-receptor interaction, whereas the electrostatic potential profile of dcp partially
fitted with those of the other compounds showing one positively charged area and only two
negatively charged areas of interaction. this can explain the action of dcp as partial agonist
observed in our experiments (fig. 3).
it is also possible that one of these charged regions found in the ca inhibitors other than involved
in the drug-receptor interaction can also play a role in the modulation of the channel gating. one of
the candidates is the sulphonamide moiety that can coordinate and stabilize the binding of the ca2+
ions with the asp-reach sites of the  xxxg1259xxx  subunit. this idea is supported by the finding that
the activation of  xxxg1259xxx  by ca inhibitors were observed exclusively in the presence of
intracellular ca2+ ions. furthermore, the fact that the observed potency of our molecules as bk
agonists were not correlated with the logp and logd parameters suggests that the binding site/s for
these drugs is located in a cytosolic hydrophilic fraction of the channel subunit possibly in the
vicinity of the ca2+ binding sites. molecular biology investigations have shown that the ca2+
binding sites are formed by an asp-reach sequence known as ca2+ bowl and that it is located on the
c terminus domain of the alpha-subunit of the  xxxg1259xxx  (7). positively charged molecules and low
intracellular ph compete with the positively charged ca2+ ions for the asp-sequence, which are
negatively charged at physiological ph, inhibiting the ca2+-dependent channel openings, whereas
negatively charged molecules have opposite effects leading to channel openings (25).
a similar mechanism is responsible for the interaction of the ca inhibitors on ca enzymes
although with some differences. it has been demonstrated that the nh function of the ionized
sulfonamide group of the ca inhibitors replaces the zinc-bond water molecule and hydrogen bonds
to the oh-group of thr-199 located in the catalytic site of the enzyme finally inhibiting the
hydration reactions of the co2 molecule. with this mode of binding, the action of the ca inhibitors
requires a fully ionized group, and therefore it is not surprising that their inhibitory actions on ca
enzyme are related to their acidity and to the pka values (26). in the case of the action of the ca
inhibitors on  xxxg1259xxx , the net negative charge due to the full dissociation of the sulphonamide
moiety is not required as demonstrated by the fact that no direct correlation can be found between
the pka values and their potency as bk openers in our experiments.
our work indicates that the ca inhibitors exert their actions on muscle bk channels by directly
interacting with the  xxxg1259xxx . this is also supported by the fact that the action of these drugs as
 xxxg1259xxx  openers was not correlated with their capability to inhibit the ca enzymes. in fact, the
reported order of potency as ca inhibitors is dcp>mtz>actz≥etx>hct with bft lacking
inhibitory effects on ca enzymes (19-21).
implications for  xxxg310xxx  therapy
the opening of muscle  xxxg1259xxx  by ca inhibitors explains the effects of these drugs in the cns
disorders and peripheral neuromuscular disorders associated to altered excitability of the cells and
altered k+ homeostasis such as epilepsy and periodic paralysis.
in this respect, actz is the first choice medication in the treatment of periodic paralyses as
compared with other ca inhibitors including dcp. the effects of these drugs have been ascribed to
their capability to inhibit the ca enzymes and to produce metabolic acidosis. in fact, these drugs
inducing metabolic acidosis can cause a ph-dependent inhibition of renal k+ ions transport and
secretion into the urine restoring the serum k+ levels in the  xxxg310xxx  patients (27-28). more recently,
it has been proposed that the lowering of intracellular ph induced by actz in the muscle would
also restore the abnormally inactivated na+ channel in those  xxxg310xxx  type 2 patients carrying the
ph-sensitive r669h and r671h mutations (29).

however, the different clinical efficacy showed by actz and dcp can be explained in terms of
their capability to bind and activate the  xxxg1259xxx  observed in our experiments independently on
the inhibition of the ca enzymes, since skeletal muscle contains ca types relatively resistant to
sulphonamide drugs (19-20). therefore, drugs showing high affinity ca2+-dependent binding on bk
channel as actz would be effective and safe in  xxxg310xxx  limiting their actions in those tissues
showing abnormalities in the homeostasis of the intracellular ca2+ ions. abnormalities in the
homeostasis of the intracellular ca2+ ions has been recently proposed in the  xxxg310xxx  type-1 and it
can affect the  xxxg1259xxx  gating, which has implications in terms of drug efficacy and tolerability
(30). this would also help to explain why actz is more effective in  xxxg310xxx -type 1 patients than in
type 2 patients particularly those carrying ph-insensitive mutations of the alpha-subunit of the voltagegated na+ channel (29, 31).

fig. 1

figure 1. effects of carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitors on  xxxg1259xxx  of skeletal muscle fibers of k+-deficient
rats.  xxxg1259xxx  current was recorded at -60 mv (vm) and +30 mv (vm), in excised patches, in the presence of 10 x
10−6m concentration of free ca2+ ions in the bath and 150 mm kcl on both sides of the membrane, in the absence
(controls) or presence of different ca inhibitors. o indicates the open channel state; c indicates the closed state of the
channel.

figure 2. structure-activity relationships of the ca inhibitors as  xxxg1259xxx  agonists. a) concentration-response
relationships of  xxxg1259xxx  currents vs. acetazolamide (actz),  xxxd1872xxx  (dcp),  xxxd2592xxx  (mtz),
 xxxd2058xxx  (etx),  xxxd2294xxx  (hct), and  xxxd299xxx  (bft). the curves were constructed at -60 mv
(vm) in the presence of 10 x 10−6 m concentration of free ca2+ ions in the bath. the drug solutions were applied on the
internal side of the membrane patches. b) chemical structures of the ca inhibitors representing the lower energy
conformers of the compounds. the intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed between the hydrogen atom of the imide of the
actz or the hydrogen atoms of the sulphonamide moieties of bft, etx, mtz, and dcp and the fluorine, nitrogen, and
chlorine atoms are shown. these had calculated inter-atomic distances ranging between 1.82 a° and 3.01 a°, while the
hct molecule formed an intra-molecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atoms of the sulphonamide moiety and the
chlorine atom of the ring but with calculated inter-atomic distances of 3.10 a°. all the conformers also had a common
planar area constituted by an aromatic ring more or less poor of electrons with the exception of the mtz molecule. the
lack of one of these two pharmacofores led to inactive compounds as observed for the mtz and hct molecules that lost
the aromaticity and showed an inter-atomic distance of the hydrogen bond >3.01 a°, respectively.

figure 3. electrostatic potential profiles of the actz, bft, etx, dcp, and of the ns-004, a cyclic
benzimidazolone with  xxxg1259xxx  opener properties used for comparison. the fitting of the molecules was performed
comparing their spatial geometry and the electrostatic potential profiles and overlapping the atoms involved in the
intramolecular hydrogen bond by using the spartan unix 5.1 software package (wavefunction inc. irvine, ca) and by
ds viewerpro 5.0 software (accelry inc.). the blue color in the graphical representation of the molecules indicates area
poor of electrons, while red color indicates area electron reach. at least 3 red color regions and 1 blue color region can be
observed for the ns-004, actx tautomer, bft, and etx molecules indicating the presence of three negatively charged
and one positively charged area in the most potent bk openers tested in our experiments. one of this area is that involved
in the formation of the intra-molecular hydrogen bond, while dcp that behaves as partial agonist showed only 2 negatively
charged and 1 positively charged area.
