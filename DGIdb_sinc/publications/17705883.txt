abstract

published a synopsis on the matter in 1977 [4]. this seminal
publication comprehensively described the deficits accompanying vasospasm and, most importantly, made the association between vasospasm and neurological deficits, also
known as delayed ischemic deficits (did).

vasospasm is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah). radiographic vasospasm usually develops between 5 and 15 days after
the initial hemorrhage, and is associated with clinically apparent
delayed ischemic neurological deficits (did) in one-third of
patients. the pathophysiology of this reversible vasculopathy is not
fully understood but appears to involve structural changes and
biochemical alterations at the levels of the vascular endothelium
and smooth muscle cells. blood in the subarachnoid space is
believed to trigger these changes. in addition, cerebral perfusion
may be concurrently impaired by hypovolemia and impaired
cerebral autoregulatory function. the combined effects of these
processes can lead to reduction in cerebral blood flow so severe
as to cause ischemia leading to infarction. diagnosis is made by
some combination of clinical, cerebral angiographic, and transcranial doppler ultrasonographic factors.  xxxd2728xxx , a calcium
channel antagonist, is so far the only available therapy with proven
benefit for reducing the impact of did. aggressive therapy
combining hemodynamic augmentation, transluminal balloon
angioplasty, and intra-arterial infusion of vasodilator drugs is, to
varying degrees, usually implemented. a panoply of drugs, with
different mechanisms of action, has been studied in sah related
vasospasm. currently, the most promising are  xxxd2534xxx ,
 xxxd32xxx  reductase inhibitors,  xxxd2738xxx 
donors and  xxxg674xxx  antagonists. this paper reviews established and emerging therapies for vasospasm.

the term vasospasm implies a reduction in the caliber of a
vessel; however, in sah it has multiple meanings. sahinduced vasospasm is a complex entity due in part to a
delayed and reversible vasculopathy, impaired autoregulatory
function, and hypovolemia causing a regional reduction of
cerebral perfusion to the point of causing ischemia [5,6].
radiographic evidence of vasospasm develops in 50% to
70% of patients with sah, but only half of those experience
symptoms of did [7-12]. proximal vessels, situated at the
base of the brain, are preferentially affected; however, more
distal arteries could also develop impaired vascular reactivity
(autoregulation), further reducing cerebral blood flow
[5,13,14]. a tendency toward spontaneous intravascular
volume contraction can further compound the deleterious
effect of a marginal cerebral blood flow (cbf) caused by
vasoconstriction. these factors are probably in play in a
subset of patients with did who show no evidence of
radiographic vasospasm.

introduction
vasospasm is a common complication that follows aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah). ecker was first to point
out the occurrence of arterial spasm following sah [1].
before him, robertson had attributed ischemic brain lesions
found on autopsy of patients with sah to probable ‘spasm of
arteries’ [2]. despite growing literature, skepticism regarding
the association between angiographic vasospasm and
clinical findings persisted [3], until cm fisher and colleagues

vasospasm adversely affects outcome in patients with sah;
it accounts for up to 23% of disability and deaths related to
sah [8,9,15-17]. however, given its predictable delayed
onset between day 5 and 15 after bleeding, it is a potentially
modifiable factor. use of  xxxd2728xxx , a calcium channel
antagonist, and prompt recognition and treatment with
hypervolemic hypertensive therapy (hht) and endovascular
interventions are likely responsible for the lower incidence of

did reported after their widespread use [17,18]. they are by
no means completely effective and additional treatments are
needed. the ongoing elucidation of the pathophysiology of
vasospasm is crucial, as it offers targets for novel therapeutic
modalities.

table 1

pathophysiology

vessel

the pathophysiology of vasospasm is far from being completely
understood. histologically, there are structural alterations in
endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall [19].
the presence of oxyhemoglobin in the subarachnoid space
seems to be necessary to produce these changes [20-22]. the
specific mechanisms leading to vasoconstriction, however, are
unknown. in vitro, oxyhemoglobin stimulates the secretion of
endothelin (et)-1, a vasoconstrictor, inhibits the vasodilator
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) and produces activated oxygen species [2325]. these free radicals are believed to play a role in cell
membrane lipid peroxidation, possibly mediating the structural
changes in the vessel wall.
whether inflammation is simply part of the multi-organ system
dysfunction encountered in sah [26] or contributes to the
development of vasospasm is unsettled. the risk of vasospasm is increased in the presence of systemic inflammatory
response syndrome [27]. furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid
(csf) levels of interleukin-1beta and -6 in patients with sah are
increased during the vasospasm period and in those in whom
vasospasm and ischemia develop later [28]. genetic and
racial factors are likely important; studies of sah from japan
revealed a higher incidence of vasospasm across different
diagnostic methods [29]. also, certain endothelial no
synthase (enos) gene polymorphisms seem to be
associated with an increased risk of vasospasm [30].
risk factors for vasospasm and did are amount and duration
of exposure to subarachnoid blood, thick blood collections in
basal cisterns and fissures, and intraventricular blood
[31-34]. interestingly, however, endovascular coiling of the
ruptured aneurysm, a procedure that does not involve a
craniotomy and washing out of the subarachnoid blood, does
not increase the risk of vasospasm in comparison to surgical
clipping [35,36]. advanced age [37], race [29], poor
neurological status on admission [17,37,38] and use of
antifibrinolytic agents [16,33,39] are also associated with the
development of did. factors less robustly linked to a higher
incidence of did are a longer duration of unconsciousness
following the initial hemorrhage [40], history of hypertension
[37,41], smoking [42,43], and excess weight [41].

because of the dynamic interplay between the inciting
factors, they might fluctuate. symptoms range from vague
and non-specific, such as excess sleepiness, lethargy, and
stupor, to a spectrum of localizing findings like hemiparesis or
hemiplegia, abulia, language disturbances, visual fields
deficits, gaze impairment, and cranial nerve palsies [4].
although localizing, these signs are not diagnostic of any
specific pathological process; therefore, alternative diagnoses,
such as rebleeding, hydrocephalus, seizures and metabolic
derangements, should be promptly excluded using radiographic, clinical and laboratory assessments. on the other
hand, the neurological changes can be subtle or unapparent,
as many individuals have an abnormal exam related to the
initial hemorrhage. detection of clinical signs of vasospasms
is particularly difficult in poor grade patients because of the
limited exam that is possible [44]. the frequent use of
sedatives in sah patients further complicates this task. thus,
the evaluation frequently includes transcranial doppler ultrasonography (tcd) and angiography. angiography can be
both diagnostic and therapeutic (see below).

diagnosis of vasospasm

cerebral angiography and transcranial doppler
ultrasonography
cerebral angiography is the gold standard for visualizing and
studying cerebral arteries. the non-invasive nature of tcd,
however, makes it an appealing method for monitoring for,
and to help confirm, the clinical diagnosis of vasospasm. it
detects elevation in mean cbf velocities, mainly in middle
and internal cerebral arteries [45,46]. although it is almost as
sensitive as angiography in detecting symptomatic vasospasm [47-49], inadequate insonation window in a proportion
of patients, unacceptably high rate of false negatives [48],
and failure to account for altered autoregulation during
hemodynamic manipulation [13] limit its utility (table 1).

clinical diagnosis
the diagnosis of vasospasm is primarily clinical. vasospasm
can be asymptomatic; however, when the net result of vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation, and inadequate
intravascular volume is a cbf below ischemic threshold,
symptoms ensue. they typically develop subacutely, and

emerging modalities
the ability of other imaging modalities, like perfusion computed
tomography [50,51], xenon computed tomography [52,53],
diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging [54,55], and
single photon emission computed tomography (spect)

[51,56] in detecting vasospasm are under investigation.
these imaging techniques could soon become routine in the
diagnosis of vasospasm [57]. unlike cerebral angiography
and tcd, these techniques measure regional perfusion, not
merely arterial diameter or flow velocities. online microdialysis is another new technique currently being studied in
vasospasm [58]. it involves measuring extracellular cerebral
fluid levels of an array of substances like glucose, glutamate,
lactate, and pyruvate.

reducing the impact of vasospasm
the typical temporal course of vasospasm and its high
incidence make prevention an attractive therapeutic approach.
however, the process is a difficult one to study and despite
investigation of a myriad of compounds, very few have made
it to the clinical arena (additional data file 1).
 xxxd2728xxx 
 xxxd2728xxx  is a dihydropyridine that blocks calcium influx
through the l-type calcium channels. it is the most rigorously
studied and only drug approved by the us food and drug
administration for use in treatment of vasospasm. it is safe
[12,59], cost-effective [60], and most importantly reduces the
risk of poor outcome and secondary ischemia after aneurysmal sah [7,10-12,61]. a major randomized controlled trial,
the british aneurysm oral  xxxd2728xxx  trial, showed a
significant reduction in the incidence of cerebral infarction
and poor outcome at three months compared to placebo [12].

how  xxxd2728xxx  exerts its beneficial effects is not well
understood and may involve neuronal as well as vascular
factors, although, of note, it does not significantly reverse
angiographic vasospasm [62].  xxxd2728xxx  is administered in
a dose of 60 mg every 4 hours for 14-21 days after sah. in
europe,  xxxd2728xxx  is also used as a continuous intravenous
infusion, although this is often associated with hypotension.
other calcium channel antagonists
 xxxd2718xxx  [62-65] and diltiazem [62,63,66,67] have both
been studied, but only  xxxd2718xxx  in a controlled fashion. in a
large randomized trial  xxxd2718xxx  decreased the incidence of
did, reduced the use of hht and reduced angiographic vasospasm, yet it did not improve overall outcome at 3 months
[62,64,65]. an unblinded small study of prophylactic, serial
intrathecal  xxxd2718xxx  was conducted in 50 patients with
sah. this approach reduced the incidence of both angiographic and clinical vasospasm and improved good clinical outcome at 1 month by 15%. adverse events were frequent; nine
patients developed headache and two had meningitis [68].

phase i and ii safety studies of diltiazem in sah demonstrated safety but no effect on vasospasm [67]. a recently
published paper describing a series of 123 sah patients
treated with oral diltiazem instead of  xxxd2728xxx  reported a
19.5% incidence of did [66]. favorable outcome (glasgow
outcome scale of 4 or 5) was achieved in 75% of patients.

tirilazad mesylate
tirilazad, a non-glucocorticoid 21 amino-steroid free radical
scavenger, was studied in several controlled trials [69-73]
following promising results in primate vasospasm models
[74-76]. it was well tolerated but had inconsistent effect on
overall outcome across the different studies, possibly related
to gender differences in drug metabolism and an interaction
with phenytoin.
prophylactic hypervolemia
in large prospective controlled studies, prophylactic volume
expansion therapy failed to reduce the incidence of clinical or
tcd-defined vasospasm, did not improve cbf, and had no
effect on outcome [77-79]. in one of those studies, costs and
complications were higher in the group treated with
prophylactic hypervolemia [77]. a small retrospective cohort
reported worsening outcome after discontinuing routine use
of albumin to induce hypervolemia in sah [80].
lumbar drainage of csf and intracisternal thrombolysis
the amount of blood in the subarachnoid space is a strong
predictor for the development of vasospasm. several interventions to facilitate the clearance of blood from the csf
following sah have been studied. cisternal irrigation by tissue
plasminogen activator [81] was relatively safe [82,83] but had
no impact on incidence of angiographic vasospasm [84]. intraand post-operative cisternal irrigation with tissue plasminogen
activator combined with continuous post-operative cisternal
drainage was associated with a low incidence of vasospasm
[85]. intracisternal infusion of urokinase has also been studied
in a small retrospective randomized, but not placebocontrolled trial [86,87]. incidence of vasospasm was
significantly reduced and outcome improved.

lumbar csf drainage following sah is another appealing
technique to clear blood from the subarachnoid space. a
non-randomized, controlled-cohort study enrolled 167
patients in whom csf drainage reduced the incidence of
clinical vasospasm, the use of angioplasty, and vasospasmrelated infarction [88]. larger placebo controlled studies are
needed to determine if these interventions produce sustained
clinical benefits.
prophylactic transluminal balloon angioplasty
following promising experimental results, a pilot study of
prophylactic transluminal balloon angioplasty (tba) was undertaken in a group of 13 patients with fisher grade 3 sah [89].
none of the patients developed did. recently, a multi-center
randomized trial evaluated the use of prophylactic tba in a
larger group of patients [90]. the procedure showed no benefit,
and was responsible for 3 deaths (4%) from vessel rupture, an
incidence higher than the 1.1% reported in the literature [91].

aggressive treatment of vasospasm
given the limited impact of established and developing
preventive measures, more aggressive interventions are often

keyrouz and diringer

implemented. the threshold for instituting these interventions
varies widely across centers. some actively intervene in the
setting of rising tcd velocities; others may treat angiographic vasospasm in asymptomatic patients, while some
require a neurological deterioration before instituting
aggressive measures. the ideal therapeutic combination
would improve cbf, reverse or attenuate did, and have low
potential for adverse events. while this intervention has yet to
be defined, varying combinations of medical and endovascular approaches are widely used to treat vasospasm.
medical therapy
hht, also described as hemodynamic augmentation, is the
cornerstone of medical therapy for vasospasm. the varying
nomenclature reflects the fact that it is unclear which specific
intervention is most effective. studies of cbf in sah patients
undergoing hht have yielded varying results. while acute
volume expansion in patients with symptomatic vasospasm
increased cbf in areas of brain most vulnerable to ischemia
on positron emission tomography (pet) [92], prophylactic
hypervolemia did not produce such a response when spect
[77] or 133xe clearance [78] were used. hht appears safe
following endovascular coiling of aneurysm [93], and even in
patients with prior cardiac disease [94].

in clinical practice, attempts to keep symptomatic patients
hypervolemic using crystalloids or colloids should be made.
although exact criteria have been hard to establish,
hypertension is induced using vasopressors until there is
clinical improvement, a preset limit is reached, or adverse
effects occur. clinical improvement can be dramatic [94], but
is an inconsistent finding across case series. prospective
controlled outcome studies of hemodynamic interventions are
lacking. yet, such clinical trials are unlikely to be completed
given the widespread use of these interventions.
endovascular therapy
endovascular techniques frequently play a role in the
aggressive treatment of vasospasm [95,96]. they include
tba and intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators. both methods
have their unique associated risks and benefits and are
usually undertaken after a trial of medical therapy except in
patients with severe cardiac disease.
transluminal balloon angioplasty
tba is very effective at reversing angiographic spasm of large
proximal vessels. it produces a sustained reversal of arterial
narrowing, although clinical improvement is inconsistent
[97-99]. the timing of tba in regard to medical therapy is
controversial. some retrospective data suggest that early
angioplasty (within 2 hours from onset of symptoms) is
associated with sustained clinical improvement [100].

age and poor neurological status are associated with poor
outcome following tba for symptomatic vasospasm [101].
the sustained effect of angioplasty may well be due to its
page 4 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

ability to disrupt connective tissue, as has been seen in the
media of cerebral arteries removed at autopsy from patients
who underwent the procedure [102]. major complications of
tba are encountered in about 5% of procedures [91] and
include vessel rupture, occlusion, dissection, hemorrhagic
infarction and hemorrhage from unsecured aneurysms [96].
intra-arterial vasodilators
papaverine is a potent smooth muscle relaxant; its use in
sah related vasospasm has been extensively studied. it is
infused intra-arterially through a micro-catheter proximal to
the vasospastic vessel. in most cases, its effect on angiographic vasospasm is immediate and dramatic [103-106] but
reversal of clinical deficits is variable [91]. papaverine has
been shown to transiently improve regional cbf [103,107].
the effect of papaverine on outcome is unknown. in one
study, when compared to patients with similar characteristics
and degree of vasospasm, patients who were treated with
papaverine had similar outcome at three months [108].

in most centers, use of papaverine has been relegated to a
secondary role or altogether abandoned because of its shortlived effect and a myriad of complications. the most serious
are increased intracranial pressure [109], brainstem depression [110], worsening of vasospasm [111,112], neurological
deterioration with gray matter changes on mri [113], and
seizures [114].
this has led to growing use of intra-arterial  xxxd2718xxx ,
verapamil,  xxxd2728xxx , and milrinone as alternatives to papaverine.  xxxd2718xxx  reverses angiographic vasospasm and
significantly reduces mean peak systolic velocities in treated
vessels, with no sustained effect on intracranial pressure or
cardiovascular function [115]. verapamil is reported to
reduce angiographic spasm and produce clinical improvement in a third of cases without significant adverse events
[116].  xxxd2728xxx  showed similar favorable results in two
small retrospective series [117,118]. controlled clinical trials
are lacking.

future directions
a number of therapies are currently being developed and are
at different stages of testing. they include  xxxd2534xxx 
(mg++), statins, no donors, and et-1 antagonists.
 xxxd2534xxx 
hypomagnesemia on admission occurs in 38% of individuals
with sah [119]. whether it independently predicts the
development of did is controversial [119,120]. the appeal of
mg++ in sah stems from its biochemical properties as a
physiological antagonist of calcium [121], ease of administration, low cost, the ability to measure and regulate concentration in body fluids [122,123], and favorable safety profile.

there have been a number of encouraging reports on the
effect of mg++ in animal models of sah related vasospasm

available online http://ccforum.com/content/11/4/2??

[124-127]. in patients with stroke and sah, administration of
mg++ is practical and safe [122,123,128-131]. in a pilot,
randomized, double blind study comparing mg++ to saline
there was a trend toward less symptomatic vasospasm with
mg++ [129]. yet a large controlled trial of continuous mg++
infusion did not find conclusive effects on did or outcome
[132]. in a small, single-center trial mg++ was similar to
intravenous  xxxd2728xxx  in preventing did [133]. on the other
hand, mg++ was of no added benefit in patients receiving
prophylactic hypervolemia/hemodilution [134]. interestingly, a
tcd study showed no improvement in elevated mean flow
velocities in middle cerebral arteries of patients with clinical
vasospasm after receiving a bolus infusion of mg++ [135].
statins
statins, or  xxxd32xxx  reductase inhibitors,
appear to have a promising role in vasospasm prevention.
the proposed mechanism of neuroprotection in vasospasm is
related to induction of the nos pathway, leading to dilation
of cerebral vessels and improved cbf [136-138].

two small randomized placebo-controlled, single-center
studies investigated the safety and feasibility of statins in
sah. in one study, pravastatin reduced the incidence of
tcd-defined vasospasm and shortened the duration of
severe vasospasm [139]. another randomized controlled trial
used simvastatin in a smaller group of patients [140]. the
incidence of tcd-defined vasospasm and did was significantly reduced in the simvastatin group. the routine use of
statins in sah is awaiting larger, multi-center clinical trials
showing clear reduction in did and improvement in overall
outcome.
 xxxd2738xxx  donors
no is a free radical gas formed by the enzyme nos from the
substrate l-arginine. it was discovered in 1987 [141] and
appears to have a crucial role in controlling cerebral
vasomotor tone. tonic release of no is an important regulator
of resting cbf; inhibition of nos constricts cerebral arteries
and decreases cbf [142-144].

intraventricular administration of sodium nitroprusside, a no
donor, to patients with medically refractory vasospasm had
variable effects on cbf and a high rate of adverse events
[145]. partial to complete reversal of angiographic vasospasm
was seen in ten patients after sodium nitroprusside [146], and
symptoms completely resolved in two. vomiting was the most
common adverse effect (in seven out of ten) and three
patients had mild fluctuation in blood pressure. in three
patients administered intrathecal sodium nitroprusside, clinical
and angiographic improvement and excellent outcome with no
systemic or neurological complications was reported [147].
finally, transdermal nitroglycerin was tested in sah. there
were no differences in terms of did and tcd velocities
between the nitroglycerin group (nine patients) and the

control group (eight patients). cbf, measured by perfusion
computed tomography, was increased in the nitroglycerin
group [148]. large randomized and controlled trials of no
donors in sah are in the planning stage.
 xxxg674xxx  antagonists
et-1 was identified in 1988 [149]. it is a 21 amino acid
peptide generated in the endothelium of blood vessels and
has an important role in vascular tone regulation. et-1 exerts
its effects through two receptor subtypes, eta and etb. eta
receptors are found on vascular smooth muscle cells and
mediate vasoconstriction of small and large blood vessels.
etb receptors, on the other hand, are found in brain, aorta,
lung and kidney vascular endothelial cells where they
modulate vasoconstriction in response to et-1, through the
production of vasodilator substances like prostacyclin and
no. they are also found on vascular smooth muscle cells
where they can mediate vasoconstriction [150-153].

a phase iia trial of clazosentan (an eta antagonist) demonstrated reduction in the incidence and severity of
angiographic vasospasm [154]. adverse events were
comparable to placebo. an eta/b antagonist, tak-044, was
also tested in a phase ii trial [155]. the drug was very well
tolerated. delayed ischemic deficits occurred in 29.5% of
patients receiving active treatment and 36.6% of patients on
placebo (risk reduction 0.8, 95% confidence interval of 0.61
to 1.06).
most recently, clazosentan was tested in a controlled clinical
trial enrolling 413 patients with sah [156]. moderate to
severe angiographic spasm was significantly reduced,
although there was no effect on outcome.
other therapies
enoxaparin, a  xxxd1997xxx , was studied in a
randomized clinical trial in sah [157]. although the incidence
of did and infarcts was reduced, the admission characteristics of the two groups were not well balanced.

 xxxd2718xxx  prolonged-release implants (npris) are placed in
the subarachnoid space at the time of surgical clipping of
aneurysm. two case series describing the use of such
implants are of interest [158,159]. in one, kasuya and
colleagues report an incidence of did of 6% when they were
applied in 69 patients with thick subarachnoid clots [158].
recently, a randomized double-blind trial of the implants
showed a dramatic reduction in incidence of angiographic
vasospasm and infarctions [160].
a randomized, controlled trial compared dapsone to placebo
(n = 49) in fisher grade 3 and 4 sah [161]. it is thought to
act as a  xxxg981xxx  antagonist and reduced the
incidence of did (26.9% versus 63.6%, p = 0.01) and significantly improved outcome at discharge and three months
(modified rankin scale).

conclusion
there is a great need for new preventive strategies and
therapies to lessen the impact of vasospasm following sah.
unfortunately, to date the available literature provides few
definitive answers. a number of factors conspire to make the
task of better defining treatment exceedingly challenging.
they include the complex, incompletely understood mechanisms operating in sah, the relatively low frequency of the
disease, and most importantly, the large number of other
factors that influence outcome is this population. to properly
study interventions in sah, very large multi-center, prospective, tightly controlled studies are needed; unfortunately, their
design and execution remains a major challenge.

this lack of definitive answers leads to a wide variation in the
specifics of managing patients with sah. yet in general,
current management focuses on screening patients at risk for
did, implementing multiple preventive measures and more
aggressive interventions in selected patients. a number of
neuroprotective approaches as well as the use of multimodal
treatment regimens [162] are under active development and
hold promise in the treatment of vasospasm.
