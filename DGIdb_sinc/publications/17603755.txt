summary niemann–pick disease type c (np-c) is a
lipid storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the
lysosomal/late endosomal system of certain cells in the
central nervous system (cns) and visceral organs.
clinical symptoms include progressive neurological
deterioration and visceral organomegaly.  xxxd2645xxx , a
small iminosugar molecule approved for the treatment
of gaucher disease, reversibly inhibits  xxxg2376xxx , which catalyses the first committed step
in glycosphingolipid synthesis. the physicochemical
properties of  xxxd2645xxx  allow it to cross the blood–
brain barrier and suggest possible benefits in lysosomal
storage diseases affecting the cns. here, we present

findings in two children with np-c, aged 14 years
(patient 1) and 9 years (patient 2), treated with
 xxxd2645xxx  for 1 year. before treatment, patient 1
presented with severe difficulties in swallowing and
walking, and patient 2 with problems mostly affecting
communication and social interaction. videofluoroscopic studies in patient 1 demonstrated a substantial
improvement in swallowing by month 6 of treatment,
and ambulation index measurements indicated improved walking. mini mental-state examination
(mmse) assessments in patient 2 showed cognitive
improvement by month 6, which was sustained up to
month 12. liver/spleen volume and plasma  xxxg444xxx  activities were stabilized in both cases. there was
no weight loss during treatment. patient 1 experienced
severe but self-limiting paresthesia, which was not
associated with peripheral neuropathy. we conclude
that  xxxd2645xxx  can provide therapeutic benefits in cns
symptoms and allows stabilization of systemic disease in
childhood-onset np-c. further follow-up is crucial to
determine the long-term maintenance of these effects.
