 xxxd351xxx , a bispeciﬁc antibody construct targeting  xxxg375xxx , is the most advanced member of bispeciﬁc t-cell engager (bite® ) molecules. the clinical development program includes b-precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (all) and b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl). minimal residual disease (mrd)
response in patients with mrd-positive b-precursor all has translated into long-term clinical beneﬁts
as demonstrated by an estimated relapse-free survival (rfs) of 60% with sustained mrd negativity at
a follow-up of 31 months. remissions induced in pediatric and adult patients with relapsed/refractory
b-precursor all have allowed for successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) in
this setting.  xxxd351xxx  has also induced durable responses in low-grade b-cell nhl.  xxxd351xxx 
recently gained approval in the united states by the u.s. food and drug administration for treatment of
philadelphia chromosome-negative b-precursor relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. amg
330 is an investigational anti- xxxg382xxx  bite® antibody construct. targeting  xxxg382xxx  ex vivo in primary samples
from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) has shown amg 330-mediated t-cell expansion and
t-cell cytotoxicity against aml cells.

1. introduction
clinical observations reaching back more than one hundred
years have shown cases of tumor regression after systemic infection. the ﬁrst successful immunotherapy against cancer was
developed by william cooley in 1891 and consisted of streptococcal
cultures used for injection in sarcoma patients (deweerdt, 2014).
cytotoxic t-lymphocytes can inhibit tumor growth, and this
property can be employed to achieve immunotherapy. this has
been demonstrated in patients with melanoma by transfer of ex
vivo expanded tumor-derived lymphocytes (dudley et al., 2005) or
of t-cell receptor gene-transfected t cells to melanoma patients
(morgan et al., 2006).
the development of t-cell-engaging antibodies (muller and
kontermann, 2007; staerz et al., 1985) has given a novel spin to the
use of cytotoxic t cells. due to lack of fc␥ receptors, conventional
antibodies cannot be used for direct recruitment of t cells. bispeciﬁc
t-cell engagers (bite® ) are built as single-chain antibody constructs

(baeuerle et al., 2008; mack et al., 1995) that redirect t cells to
tumor cells, by connecting a t cell via cd3 to a tumor-speciﬁc antigen on the surface of the tumor cell. this induces the formation
of a transient cytolytic synapse between the cytotoxic t cell and
the tumor cell resulting in t-cell activation, proliferation, and serial
lysis of tumor cells (fig. 1). bite® -mediated tumor cell lysis involves
fusion of vesicles (which contain granzymes and perforins) with
the tumor cell membrane resulting in pore-formation by perforins
and granzyme b-induced apoptosis. simultaneously, t-cell activation results in up-regulation of activation markers and adhesion
molecules on the t-cell surface, production of additional granzymes
and perforins and release of cytokines. furthermore, t cells enter
into cell cycle and t-cell proliferation is induced (brandl et al., 2007;
brischwein et al., 2007; haas et al., 2009; hoffmann et al., 2005).
bite® molecules directly engage any cytotoxic t cell and thus
do not require generation of tumor-speciﬁc t-cell clones by priming of naïve t cells through antigen-presenting cells, as known for
other t-cell–based therapeutic strategies (baeuerle et al., 2009).
furthermore, bite® -mediated t-cell activation does not rely on
the presence of mhc class i molecules and tumor-speciﬁc peptide
antigens (baeuerle et al., 2009). bite® molecules currently under
clinical evaluation target a variety of tumor-speciﬁc antigens, most
importantly  xxxg375xxx  (expressed on b cells) and  xxxg382xxx  (expressed on

myeloid-derived cells) as well as speciﬁc antigens associated with
solid tumors, such as  xxxg708xxx  (epcam;
cd326), prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen ( xxxg806xxx ), and  xxxg427xxx  (cea;  xxxg427xxx ) (frankel and baeuerle, 2013).
tumor-associated antigens targeted by other bispeciﬁc antibody
formats include the  xxxg1177xxx  receptor ␣ ( xxxg1178xxx ) or the human
c-type lectin-like molecule 1 (cll-1) in the setting of aml (lu et al.,
2014; stein et al., 2010). bispeciﬁc antibody formats for treatment
of various solid tumor types are currently also in development
(garber, 2014).
in this review we provide an overview of recent preclinical and
clinical results for the investigational bite® antibody constructs
 xxxd351xxx  (which has dual speciﬁcity for  xxxg375xxx  and cd3) in
b-cell malignancies, and amg 330 (which has dual speciﬁcity for
 xxxg382xxx  and cd3) in myeloid malignancies.
2. anti- xxxg375xxx  bite®  xxxd351xxx 
 xxxd351xxx  is an investigational single-chain antibody construct of the bite® class that is designed to direct t cells to target
b cells.  xxxd351xxx  combines in one polypeptide chain the binding speciﬁcity for both the pan–b-cell antigen  xxxg375xxx  and the cd3
epsilon chain of the t-cell receptor complex, with a molecular
weight of approximately 55 kda (nagorsen et al., 2012). biological
activity of  xxxd351xxx  comprises release of different cytokines
(e.g., tnf-␣, ifn-␥, il-6, il-10) by t cells in the presence of target cells, induction of activation markers (e.g., cd69, cd25) and
expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., cd2, lfa-1) on the t-cell
surface (brandl et al., 2007). furthermore,  xxxd351xxx  has been
shown to exhibit high cytotoxic activity at very low concentrations,
and activity has been demonstrated to be independent of t-cell
co-stimulation (dreier et al., 2002, 2003; lofﬂer et al., 2000).
2.1. administration of  xxxd351xxx 
the majority of monoclonal antibodies for cancer therapy are
administered to patients by intravenous (iv) injection. during
early clinical development of  xxxd351xxx , short-term infusions
with  xxxd351xxx  were investigated in patients with relapsed
or refractory non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl).  xxxd351xxx  was
administered at different doses, given once or twice weekly, as a

2- or 4-h iv infusion. given  xxxd351xxx ’s half-life of approximately 2 h, this administration strategy was unlikely to have
achieved constant serum concentrations across a given 24-h period.
although  xxxd351xxx  exhibited biologic activity (i.e., cytokine
release, t-cell activation), clinical responses did not occur. based on
these observations, the administration schedule of  xxxd351xxx 
was modiﬁed to continuous iv (civ) infusion. this change of administration strategy resulted in a prolonged t-cell activation and
sustained b-cell depletion, and clinical activity in the form of partial remissions (prs) and complete remissions (crs) was observed.
systemic exposure to  xxxd351xxx  via civ infusion was dose proportional and stable with time (nagorsen et al., 2012).
continuous  xxxd351xxx  infusion is administered via a
portable mini-pump (nagorsen et al., 2012). the pump is preprogrammed to ensure the ﬂow rate is continuous and uniform
throughout the infusion. the patient can move about freely while
the infusion pump is in use because it is portable, lightweight,
and supported in a pouch with a shoulder strap or belt. patients
therefore can be treated either in the hospital or at home. in the
clinical setting, patients are treated initially as an inpatient with
close monitoring. after a required observation period, the patient
may return home at any time depending on the clinical assessment and judgment of the investigator. alternatively, treatment
may also be continued in the hospital, depending on the health status of the patient. at home, the patient may be visited by a home
healthcare provider or return to the outpatient clinic to ensure that
 xxxd351xxx  is administered continuously and the iv bags are
changed according to schedule. current data from ongoing clinical trials demonstrate that the mean duration of treatment in the
hospital lessens with each subsequent cycle (through cycle 4), and
patients spend progressively more time in a home setting with each
cycle.
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of
 xxxd351xxx  have important clinical implications. a continuous
infusion over 4 weeks provides sufﬁcient serum exposure for sustained b-cell depletion and prolonged t-cell activation, and has the
potential to provide meaningful therapeutic beneﬁts in relapsed or
refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all). in clinical studies,
an integrated strategy to support the safe handling and administration of  xxxd351xxx  has been developed. a key component
of this strategy is the ability to administer  xxxd351xxx  on a

schedule of iv bag changes that ﬁts within the constraints of pharmacy and caregiver staff and allows patients who are well enough
to be treated in an outpatient home care setting.

2.2. clinical outcome in adult patients
 xxxd351xxx  has an extensive clinical development program,
with clinical trials evaluating its activity across a range of different
malignancies. these studies are summarized in table 1.

2.2.1. non-hodgkin lymphoma
 xxxd351xxx  was administered in a phase 1 trial to 38 patients
with relapsed nhl as a civ infusion over 4–8 weeks at doses from
0.5 to 60 ␮g/m2 /day. eleven patients achieved clinical responses
at doses ≥15 ␮g/m2 /day (four patients had crs, and seven patients
had prs). responses occurred in patients with follicular lymphoma,
mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. at doses
≥15 ␮g/m2 /day,  xxxd351xxx  induced responses in lymph node
lesions, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. in nine of 11 (82%) cases
of bone marrow inﬁltration, immunohistochemical and ﬂow cytometric analysis of patient biopsies revealed complete or partial
elimination of tumor cells from bone marrow; three of these nine
patients had no objective response in their lymph node tumors. the
most common adverse events (aes) were pyrexia, lymphopenia
and leukopenia, chills, and increase in  xxxg520xxx . most aes
were observed within the ﬁrst week of treatment. neurologic aes
with symptoms and signs of encephalopathy – including disorientation, confusion, speech disorders, tremor, and convulsions – were

recorded. they were all clinically reversible. cytokine release
syndrome (crs) was not observed (bargou et al., 2008).
2.2.2. mrd-positive b-precursor all
persistence or reappearance of minimal residual disease (mrd)
after induction chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be a major
negative prognostic factor for b-lineage all and an early indicator
of chemorefractory disease (bassan et al., 2009; borowitz et al.,
2008; bruggemann et al., 2006; conter et al., 2010; raff et al., 2007;
van der velden et al., 2009). more than 90% of patients with mrd
after chemotherapy have a hematologic relapse (gökbuget et al.,
2012). the only curative option for patients with mrd-positive
all is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct);
however, the prognosis is still not optimal (bader et al., 2009).
because of the high clinical activity of  xxxd351xxx  observed
in bone marrow involvement in patients with nhl, a single-arm
phase 2 trial in mrd of b-precursor all was initiated in collaboration with the german multicenter study group (gmall) (topp
et al., 2011). the trial was designed as two parts, with a dose ﬁnding
part followed by a 2-stage extension. the selected dosing regimen
consisted of 6-week cycles of  xxxd351xxx  as a single agent at a
dose of 15 ␮g/m2 /day. a cycle was deﬁned as a 4-week civ infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval. twenty-one
patients with persistent or relapsed mrd-positive b-precursor all,
after induction and consolidation regimens by gmall standards,
were treated with  xxxd351xxx . one patient permanently discontinued treatment within the ﬁrst cycle due to reversible grade
3 seizure, and was therefore not evaluable for response. among
20 evaluable patients, ﬁfteen had persistent mrd and ﬁve had

an mrd relapse prior to  xxxd351xxx . sixteen out of 20 (80%)
evaluable patients achieved an mrd response deﬁned as mrd negativity (<10−4 ) within 4 cycles of treatment (topp et al., 2011). at
a median observation time of 33 months, the kaplan–meier estimate for hematologic relapse-free survival (rfs) was 61%. in the
16 mrd responders, the lower bound of the 95% ci for median
rfs was 19.1 months. in the four nonresponders, the lower bound
of the 95% ci for median rfs was 3.2 months. nine patients
underwent allogeneic hsct after  xxxd351xxx  treatment. at a
median follow-up of 33 months, the kaplan–meier estimate for
rfs was 65% in patients with allogeneic hsct after  xxxd351xxx 
treatment. only one transplantation-related death was recorded. of
the 11 patients without allogeneic hsct after  xxxd351xxx  treatment, estimated rfs was 60% at a median follow-up of 31 months
(topp et al., 2012).
patients not treated with  xxxd351xxx  who undergo allogeneic hsct after molecular failure in ﬁrst cr have a 5-year survival
of 54%, and patients without allogeneic hsct have a 5-year survival of 33% (gökbuget et al., 2012). our follow-up data show that
 xxxd351xxx  treatment can improve rfs in patients with mrdpositive b-precursor all. thus, mrd response seems to remain a
clinically meaningful endpoint after  xxxd351xxx  treatment.

2.2.3. relapsed/refractory b-precursor all
relapsed/refractory all has an unfavorable prognosis. three
pediatric patients with b-precursor all who had relapsed after allogeneic hsct received  xxxd351xxx  on a compassionate use basis,
demonstrating that administration in this setting was feasible.
two of the three patients had mrd-positive b-precursor all and
one had relapsed/refractory b-precursor all. in the patient with
relapsed/refractory all and a 90% blast count, the bone marrow
was cleared of blasts within 2 weeks of  xxxd351xxx  treatment
(handgretinger et al., 2011).
based on these results, a single-arm phase 2 trial in adult
patients with relapsed/refractory b-precursor all was initiated
in collaboration with the gmall. the design included a doseﬁnding part and a 2-stage extension. unlike in mrd-positive all, in
relapsed/refractory all clinical crs was observed in the ﬁrst days
of treatment at a dose of 15 ␮g/m2 /day. thus, the selected dosing regimen included a lower initial dose of 5 ␮g/m2 /day in the
ﬁrst week of the ﬁrst cycle followed by 15 ␮g/m2 /day during the
remaining 3 weeks of the ﬁrst cycle, and in case of blast counts
above 50% a prephase with dexamethasone and/or cyclophosphamide. subsequent cycles were administered in the same way
as for patients with mrd-positive b-precursor all: 15 ␮g/m2 /day
in each week. as in the study evaluating  xxxd351xxx  in mrdpositive b-precursor all, a cycle was deﬁned as a 4-week civ
infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval. thirty-six
patients with relapsed/refractory b-precursor all were treated
with  xxxd351xxx . the primary endpoint was cr and cr with
partial hematologic recovery (crh*). major secondary endpoints
included mrd response, rate of allogeneic hsct realization, rfs,
overall survival (os), and incidence of aes. the patient population was young, with a median age of 32 years (range, 18–77).
remission (deﬁned as cr/crh*) occurred in 25 patients (69%). an
mrd response occurred in 88% of patients with cr/crh*. thirteen
patients (52%) with cr/crh* underwent allogeneic hsct after  xxxd351xxx  treatment. the most common ae was pyrexia (grade 1
or 2 in 75%, grade 3 in 6% of patients). neurologic aes led to temporary or permanent treatment discontinuation in six, and crs in two
patients. these aes resolved clinically. four of the six patients with
nervous system or psychiatric disorder aes presenting as seizures
resumed treatment at a lower dose; patients with seizures received
antiseizure prophylaxis (topp et al., 2014).

2.3. clinical outcome in pediatric patients
2.3.1. mrd-positive b-precursor all
the ﬁrst clinical experience in two pediatric patients with mrdpositive b-precursor all showed that  xxxd351xxx  was well
tolerated and rapidly induced mrd-negative crs after multiple
relapses and after allogeneic hsct (handgretinger et al., 2011).
it is noteworthy that none of the patients showed any signs of
graft-versus-host disease despite the engagement of donor-derived
human leukocyte antigen (hla)-matched, partially matched, or
three-locus mismatched haploidentical t-lymphocytes.
2.3.2. relapsed/refractory b-precursor all
nine pediatric patients with b-precursor all who relapsed
after allogeneic hsct were treated with  xxxd351xxx  on compassionate use basis by 4-week civ infusions at a dose of 5 or
15 ␮g/m2 /day. cr after the ﬁrst treatment cycle was observed in
four patients; cr after the second cycle was observed in two additional patients. these patients, who had been refractory after the
ﬁrst cycle, had received chemotherapy between the ﬁrst and second cycle to reduce the blast counts. four patients underwent
a successful allogeneic hsct with haploidentical donors. rfs by
kaplan–meier estimate was 30% at a median follow-up of 398 days.
grade 3 seizures in one patient and grade 3 crs in two patients
were observed as medically important aes. these data indicate that
 xxxd351xxx  can enable an additional allogeneic hsct with longterm rfs after achieving cr in pediatric patients with b-precursor
all who had relapsed after initial allogeneic hsct (schlegel et al.,
2014).
based on these encouraging results, a global phase 1/2 trial in
pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory b-precursor all was
initiated in collaboration with the international berlin frankfurt
muenster study group and the children’s oncology group. a major
objective of the phase 1 part was to ﬁnd the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and the optimal  xxxd351xxx  dose. the target
population included patients (<18 years) with relapsed/refractory
b-precursor all that was refractory, in second or greater bone
marrow relapse, or in bone marrow relapse after allogeneic hsct.
one cycle was deﬁned as 4-week civ  xxxd351xxx  infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval. doses of 5, 15, 30, and
15→30 ␮g/m2 /day were employed with mtd as the primary endpoint. dose-limiting toxicities were grades 4 and 5 crs and grade
5 respiratory failure. the mtd was 15 ␮g/m2 /day, and the optimal
dose to mitigate crs was an initial dose of 5 ␮g/m2 /day for 1 week
and then 15 ␮g/m2 /day for the remaining treatment period of the
ﬁrst cycle and from the second cycle on. the most common aes
were pyrexia, headache, and hypertension, regardless of causality. only one patient permanently discontinued treatment due to a
grade 3 seizure in cycle 2. fifteen out of 41 (37%) patients achieved
a cr (whitlock et al., 2014). one patient experiencing a grade 4
crs was treated with dexamethasone during  xxxd351xxx  treatment and with the anti-il-6 receptor antibody  xxxd3388xxx  after
discontinuation of  xxxd351xxx  infusion (teachey et al., 2013).
in vitro data have shown that dexamethasone does not impair
 xxxd351xxx -induced t-cell proliferation (brandl et al., 2007).
because  xxxd3388xxx  was administered after discontinuation, no
data are currently available on the effect of simultaneous administration of  xxxd3388xxx  on the efﬁcacy of  xxxd351xxx  (teachey
et al., 2013).
2.4. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of  xxxd351xxx 
 xxxd351xxx  was administered as civ infusion for 4 weeks
in patients with all (topp et al., 2011, 2014) and up to 8 weeks
in patients with nhl (bargou et al., 2008). dose steps from
5→15 ␮g/m2 /day and 15→60 ␮g/m2 /day (only nhl) after 1 and 2

weeks, respectively, were introduced to mitigate aes such as crs in
all.  xxxd351xxx  steady-state serum concentrations (css ) were
reached 24 h after start of infusion or dose step. css levels obtained
by civ administration were linear to dose with approximately
0.7 ng/ml reached at 15 ␮g/m2 /day and approximately 3 ng/ml at
60 ␮g/m2 /day, which are the respective maintenance doses for all
and nhl (bargou et al., 2008; hijazi et al., 2013; schub et al., 2013).
to achieve high rates of clinical response, different maintenance
doses are required in all versus nhl, most likely due to different disease origin and location/accessibility (i.e., b-precursor vs.
mature b-cell state; bone marrow vs. lymph node).
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd351xxx  also had an impact on
its immunopharmacodynamics. consistent with its mode of action,
 xxxd351xxx -induced depletion of peripheral b cells occurred
within the ﬁrst treatment week in most patients with nhl and
all, was complete at dose levels ≥5 ␮g/m2 /day, and sustained
throughout treatment with no b-cell recovery between treatment
cycles (hijazi et al., 2013; klinger et al., 2009; schub et al., 2013).
b-cell depletion kinetics were typically dose-dependent (i.e.,
higher doses led to a faster b-cell decline irrespective of initial
t-cell counts) (hijazi et al., 2013; klinger et al., 2009). t-cell
kinetics always showed a distinct course characterized by t-cell
redistribution in the ﬁrst week after start of infusion or any dose
step, a potential t-cell expansion in the following two treatment
weeks, and some t-cell contraction versus the end of the treatment
cycle (bargou et al., 2008; klinger et al., 2006, 2012). this time
course largely resembles kinetics during normal t-cell responses
to pathogens also consisting of t-cell activation, expansion, and
contraction. the initial t-cell redistribution was characterized by
a swift disappearance of peripheral t cells within the ﬁrst 6–12 h
after start of infusion or any dose step, followed by a return of t cells
to baseline levels in the ﬁrst treatment week (klinger et al., 2012;
schub et al., 2013). simultaneously, expression of the early t-cell
activation marker cd69 was upregulated up to 48 h after start of
infusion or any dose step (klinger et al., 2012). after t-cell return,
an overall t-cell expansion above baseline levels was observed in
many responding patients (bargou et al., 2008; klinger et al., 2006,
2012; topp et al., 2011). these increased t-cell counts were mainly
due to an expansion of several memory t-cell subsets (e.g., cd8+
tem and temra cells, and cd4+ tem and tcm cells), which besides
displaying high cytotoxic activity against  xxxd351xxx -targeted
b cells proliferated in response to activation by  xxxd351xxx 
(bargou et al., 2008; klinger et al., 2006, 2012; topp et al., 2011).
increased numbers of effector t cells might directly translate into
increased  xxxd351xxx -mediated antitumor activity and also
indirectly beneﬁt this highly immunocompromised patient population. following expansion, some t-cell contraction was observed
toward the end of the treatment cycle, with t-cell counts usually
remaining above baseline levels (klinger et al., 2012). this pattern
of t-cell dynamics was generally seen throughout all treatment
cycles; however, peripheral t-cell expansion and contraction
in the second and subsequent cycles seemed to depend on an
accessible activation matrix (i.e., no t-cell expansion was observed
after complete b-cell depletion) (klinger et al., 2012). cytokine
release (predominantly il-6, il-10 and ifn-␥) by activated t cells
also seemed to correlate with b-cell counts, in addition to  xxxd351xxx  dose (hijazi et al., 2013; schub et al., 2013). generally,
serum cytokine concentrations peaked within 24–48 h after start of
infusion or any dose step before rapidly declining back to baseline
(klinger et al., 2012). overall cytokine levels were highest after
start of infusion, with signiﬁcantly lower concentrations detected
at any subsequent dose steps up to the respective  xxxd351xxx 
maintenance dose. very little cytokine release was detected in
additional treatment cycles (klinger et al., 2012), in line with the
previous b-cell depletion. crs was observed in all but not in nhl
patients (at doses up to 90 ␮g/m2 /day) favoring absolute numbers

and accessibility of target b cells (bone marrow vs. lymph node) as
main causes for crs development. pretreatment dexamethasone
application (reduction of b-cell counts), dose-step design (reduction of initial t-cell activation), and anti-il-6 receptor antibody
treatment (prevention of il-6-mediated effects) (teachey et al.,
2013) have all been successfully used to mitigate crs development.
 xxxd351xxx  showed a predictable pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic proﬁle in both all and nhl patients, characterized by dose-linear css , rapid and sustained b-cell depletion, t-cell
activation, redistribution and expansion, and transient cytokine
release. extensive analyses of b- and t-cell pharmacodynamic
parameters have not yet shown any correlations with clinical
response (klinger et al., 2012; schub et al., 2013); however, higher
overall cytokine levels might indicate a better t-cell activation
potential and thus, response. in this context, approaches to combine  xxxd351xxx  with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as
ipilimumab or  xxxd2743xxx  might be warranted to further enhance
t-cell activity, especially in more solid-like tumors like nhl.
moreover, b-cell-related factors like speciﬁc mutations in the
apoptosis-inducing caspase pathway or outgrowth of preexisting
 xxxg375xxx -negative b-cell clones are likely to contribute to unresponsiveness to  xxxd351xxx  treatment. further research is needed to
deﬁne predictive pharmacodynamic markers for clinical response.

3. anti- xxxg382xxx  bite® amg 330
overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml)
is poor and has not signiﬁcantly improved over the past decade
(burnett et al., 2011). post-remission therapy for elimination of
residual leukemic cells after intensive induction chemotherapy
remains a major challenge to prevent relapse. a high burden of
mrd has been shown to correlate with high relapse rates and poor
prognosis (hubmann et al., 2014; kohnke et al., 2014). in large
patient cohorts of older, unﬁt patients, treatment options are even
more limited and consist of palliative cytoreductive chemotherapy
and best supportive care. novel immunotherapeutic strategies for
eradication of aml bulk cells as well as quiescent, chemorefractory
leukemic cells are highly needed.
antibody-based approaches in aml focus on targeting  xxxg382xxx 
(a sialic acid-dependent cytoadhesion molecule) as it has been
shown to be ubiquitously expressed (kung sutherland et al., 2013).
in a large comprehensive analysis of adult patients with aml,
 xxxg382xxx  expression levels were correlated to speciﬁc disease characteristics (krupka et al., 2014). disappointingly, lintuzumab, a
monoclonal, unconjugated antibody targeting  xxxg382xxx  has shown to
provide little clinical activity in a phase 2b clinical trial (feldman
et al., 2005). the clinical data might be explained by the fact
that  xxxg382xxx  is an internalizing antigen and that nk cells in aml
patients are impaired (lion et al., 2012), thereby compromising
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. aml cells themselves
diminish functional nk-cell responses by decreased surface expression of ligands for various nk-cell-activating receptors or increased
expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors, as more recently
discovered for glucocorticoid-induced  xxxg2296xxx  receptor (tnfr)-related protein ligand (baessler et al., 2009), cd137l
(baessler et al., 2010), and cd200 (coles et al., 2011). therefore, it
is conceivable that the novel alpha-emitting 213 bi-conjugated anticd33 antibody will achieve improved clinical results with tolerable
aes (rosenblat et al., 2010).
by far the most prominent anti- xxxg382xxx  antibody in clinical application is  xxxd2190xxx  ( xxxd2190xxx ® ). the antibody is
conjugated to calicheamicin, a toxin that upon internalization
causes dna double-strand breaks by binding to the minor groove.
in 2000, the drug was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration under its accelerated approval program for the treatment

of patients older than 60 years with  xxxg382xxx -positive aml in ﬁrst
relapse who were not eligible for standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (bross et al., 2001).  xxxd2190xxx  was voluntarily
withdrawn from the market when a conﬁrmatory, postapproval
clinical trial was prematurely terminated because of failure to verify clinical beneﬁt and concerns about increased aes (petersdorf
et al., 2013). however, this trial used a 25% lower dose of  xxxd1816xxx  in the  xxxd2190xxx  arm with the intent to achieve
equitoxicity. thus, a potential beneﬁt of  xxxd2190xxx 
might have been masked by an effector chemotherapy with an
insufﬁcient therapeutic window. and ﬁnally, the dosing scheme
of  xxxd2190xxx  might not have been optimal. multiple
clinical trials are currently testing  xxxd2190xxx  in different clinical settings and deﬁned patient populations. from this
data, certain safety aspects concerning  xxxg382xxx -targeting drugs can
be deduced: aes were mainly attributed to direct toxicity of the
toxin rather than unwanted  xxxg382xxx -targeted toxicity (lichtenegger
et al., 2013). it is possible that non- xxxg382xxx -mediated gemtuzumab
ozogamicin uptake via endocytosis might have added to the
observed toxicity (jedema et al., 2004).
targeting  xxxg382xxx  using a bispeciﬁc anti- xxxg382xxx  bite® antibody
construct circumvents prior pitfalls of  xxxg382xxx -targeted therapy as
neither internalization after monovalent binding to  xxxg382xxx  nor offtarget, toxin-mediated toxicity is to be expected. importantly,
reports on differential responses to monoclonal antibodies due
to fc␥ receptor polymorphisms (mellor et al., 2013) or inhibitory
fc␥ receptors (lim et al., 2011) are not relevant for the mode of
action of bite® molecules. the investigational anti- xxxg382xxx  bite®
antibody construct amg 330 solely relies on t-cell rather than on
macrophage or nk-cell activity. in primary samples from patients
with aml, amg 330-mediated lysis was similar to that of healthy
donors (aigner et al., 2013). furthermore, amg 330 has been evaluated ex vivo for its suitability as a therapeutic agent in aml using
peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with
newly diagnosed aml (krupka et al., 2014). to simulate the natural
setting of target and t cells in aml patients and the prolonged drug
exposure typically used for bite® treatment cycles, a long-term
culture system for primary aml cells was established that allowed
observation of co-cultures for up to 5 weeks (krupka et al., 2014).
results appeared promising, as amg 330 efﬁciently recruited and
expanded residual t cells within the patient sample. even at low
effector-to-target ratios, the redirected t cells lysed autologous
cells completely in the majority of samples and substantially in the
remaining samples in a time-dependent manner. effective elimination of aml cells was even observed at very low effector-to-target
ratios (up to 1:80). as already shown in the clinical setting for
 xxxd351xxx  (bargou et al., 2008; klinger et al., 2006, 2012; topp
et al., 2011), a selective expansion of cd4- and cd8-positive memory t cells could be observed. naive t cells were not expanded by
amg 330, and neither were terminally differentiated t cells, probably because of their poor proliferative capacity. also, there was no
increase in the percentage of regulatory t cells, suggesting that this
cell population will not suppress amg 330-mediated lysis efﬁcacy.
in addition to the effector-to-target cell ratio,  xxxg382xxx  expression level was found to be a key contributing factor inﬂuencing
amg 330-mediated lysis kinetics (krupka et al., 2014). using differentially expressing aml cell lines, it was shown that cd33bright
cells were lysed faster than cd33dim cells. however, although  xxxg382xxx 
expression level inﬂuenced lysis kinetics, even cd33dim -expressing
cells were successfully eradicated. different levels of  xxxg382xxx  expression have been described on rna and protein level within one
aml patient sample. in general, bulk aml cells demonstrated a
higher  xxxg382xxx  expression level compared to leukemic stem cells
(lscs) deﬁned by the cd34+ / xxxg384xxx − phenotype (krupka et al.,
2014). importantly, healthy stem cells were shown to express  xxxg382xxx 
to a signiﬁcantly lower degree, indicating that amg 330 has the

potential to target lscs while leaving hematopoietic stem cells
(hscs) untouched. other studies have demonstrated that cd33positive cells from aml patients are able to engraft leukemia in
severe combined immunodeﬁciency (scid) mice, suggesting stem
cell function (taussig et al., 2005). thus, the data suggest that amg
330 is able to target cd33bright and cd33dim aml cells within one
population as well as different subsets of leukemia with variable
 xxxg382xxx  expression levels. nevertheless, aml is a heterogeneous disease that may also arise from  xxxg382xxx -negative precursors and would
thus be resistant to  xxxg382xxx -targeted immunotherapy (walter et al.,
2012).
the potential toxic effect of amg 330 on healthy bone marrow
cells has been tested in a colony forming unit assay. no differences
in colony forming units could be detected between bone marrow
samples pretreated with amg 330 or control bite® antibody construct even at very high amg 330 concentrations (krupka et al.,
2014).
aigner and colleagues studied the cytotoxic activity of amg 330
in detail by conducting different co-culture experiments of
mononuclear cells (mncs) from healthy donors with either aml
cell lines or blast-containing mncs derived from aml patients
(aigner et al., 2013). in both settings, amg 330 induced lysis of aml
target cells in contrast to co-culture experiments with a control
bite® molecule. furthermore, u937 aml cells co-incubated with
human t cells isolated from either healthy donors or aml patients
revealed a comparable amg 330-mediated lysis of aml target cells
(i.e., no impairment of t-cell activity in aml patients). in addition
to target cell lysis, amg 330 has also been shown to induce expression of activation markers on t cells and proliferation of t cells in
autologous culture settings. finally, in vivo experiments with aml
cell line-injected immunodeﬁcient mice and subsequently injected
human t cells showed an amg 330-mediated reduction in tumor
volume and increased numbers of tumor-inﬁltrating t cells (aigner
et al., 2013).
in summary, all data strongly suggest  xxxg382xxx  as a suitable target
antigen for bite® therapy in aml. the anti- xxxg382xxx -bite® antibody
construct amg 330 is able to activate t cells from adult aml
patients at the time of primary diagnosis without any limitations
with respect to proliferation, cytokine secretion, and lysis efﬁcacy.
these results strongly support further development of amg 330 in
clinical trials in patients with aml with a high medical need for new
therapies (walter, 2014). the bite® technology is a very exciting
and promising strategy and will hopefully give the clinician a new
weapon to combat aml.

4. summary and outlook
4.1.  xxxd351xxx 
from the data presented herein, a number of key features
have emerged. clinical activity of  xxxd351xxx  is dosedependent and is higher in mrd-positive b-precursor all
than in relapsed/refractory b-precursor all (topp et al., 2011,
2012, 2014). the response kinetics are faster in bone marrow and
peripheral blood than in the lymph node compartment. peripheral
blood and bone marrow can be cleared of malignant cells within
2 weeks, whereas the time to response in lymph node tumors can
take up to 8 weeks (bargou et al., 2008; hijazi et al., 2013; schub
et al., 2013).  xxxd351xxx  can be safely administered in patients
who have relapsed after allogeneic hsct, and sequential combination of  xxxd351xxx  followed by allogeneic hsct is feasible
(handgretinger et al., 2011; schlegel et al., 2014; topp et al., 2014).
patients who initially do not respond to  xxxd351xxx  can become
responders by intermittent administration of chemotherapy before
the next cycle of  xxxd351xxx . major toxicities include crs and
