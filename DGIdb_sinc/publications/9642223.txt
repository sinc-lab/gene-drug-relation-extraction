peroxynitrite (onoo2,  xxxg2030xxx ), the product of the reaction
between  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and the superoxide anion
(o2. ), reacts with lipids, aromatic amino acids, or metalloproteins, e.g. complex i, ii, and iii of the respiratory chain and
aconitase (1,2) and is also a powerful oxidant of thiols. if the
latter are vicinal, a disulfide can be formed (3,4). another
possible reaction is the nitration of tryptophan (5) and tyrosine
residues favored at neutral ph and involving fe31 ions (6), the
latter of which can form potent nitrating complexes in the
presence of edta. a causal link between protein and enzyme

nitration by pn and several neurodegenerative diseases as well
as aging has been postulated. for example, some patients with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) carry mutated cu/zn superoxide dismutase, leading to the stabilization of pn and
thereby resulting in enhanced nitration of important target
enzymes (7). additionally, reactive oxygen species have been
implicated in a variety of myocardial diseases, especially in
ischemia/reperfusion injury, which is accompanied by free radical generation (8, 9). nevertheless, pn also serves an important physiological function in macrophages, where it is present
in high concentrations and helps to eliminate targets prone to
degradation (10).
earlier it was shown that the cytosolic muscle isoform of ck
(mm-ck) is inactivated by h2o2 (11) and also that a decrease
in heart mitochondrial mi-ck activity was due to the latter
reactive oxygen species (12). in a skinned cardiac muscle fiber
assay, myofibrillar mm-ck was recently shown to be the main
target of reactive oxygen species in the myofibrillar compartment (13), indicating that a decreased cytosolic ck activity
induced by reactive oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion could be of clinical/pathological significance. this is supported by the fact that inhibition of the ck reaction by iodoacetamide in isolated perfused rat heart induced serious alterations of cardiac function (14). the target of iodoacetamide- and
reactive oxygen species-induced reactions on ck is likely to be
the same highly reactive active-site cysteine (15, 16).
perfusion of isolated rat heart with the no donor s-nitrosoacetylcysteine led to a decrease in heart contractile reserve and
inhibition of cardiac ck by 65%, which, however, was reversible in vitro after the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, indicating that the “essential” cysteine 278 residue of ck
was the possible target for nitrosothiol modification (17). these
data indicate that ck is a target for no or its congeners and
accords with the fact that skeletal muscle mm-ck bound to the
sarcoplasmic reticulum and also the ck-mediated ca21 uptake
by the ca21-atpase are inhibited by the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione, suggesting that nitrogen monoxides, including
no1, noz, and no2, inactivate ck, most likely by promoting
nitrosylation of the critical sulfhydryl group(s) of the enzyme
(18). the inactivation of creatine kinase in skeletal muscle was
shown to be enhanced by high amounts of fe31 (19). in skeletal
and heart muscle as well as in brain, mitochondria are the
major source of potentially toxic oxygen-derived free radicals
(20), especially after ischemia and reflow episodes. the newly
discovered no synthase isoform, which is indeed localized in
mitochondria as suggested (21, 53, 54), would produce no
within the mitochondria, a notorious source of o2. . mitochondria are therefore a major source of pn in the cell. in the
present study, we investigated whether the mitochondrial ck
isoform would be a vulnerable target of this free radical at
different levels of complexity, (i) as purified enzyme, (ii) when

the reaction of peroxynitrite (pn) with sarcomeric
mitochondrial creatine kinase ( xxxg470xxx ; ec 2.7.3.2) was
observed at different stages of complexity (i) with purified mi-ck, (ii) with enzyme bound on isolated mitoplasts, and (iii) within intact respiring mitochondria.
creatine-stimulated respiration was abolished by pn
concentrations likely to be physiological and far before
the respiratory chain itself was affected, thus demonstrating that mi-ck is a prime target for inactivation by
pn in intact mitochondria. the inactivation by pn of
mi-ck was reversed by 22% with 2- xxxd26xxx .
more remarkable protective effects were noticed with
the full set of ck substrates, e.g. 30 and 50% protection
with mgatp plus creatine and mgadp plus phosphocreatine, respectively, but not with each substrate alone.
these data indicate an involvement of the active-site
cys-278 residue of mi-ck in this process. furthermore,
changes in endogenous tryptophan fluorescence intensity and spectral changes after reaction of mi-ck with
pn suggest additional modifications of trp and tyr residues. pn-inactivated mi-ck can no longer be efficiently
converted into dimers by incubation with reagents inducing a transition state analog complex at the active
site. thus, obviously, upon reaction of octameric mi-ck
with pn, the octamer-dimer equilibrium of mi-ck is also
affected. the consequences for cellular energy homeostasis and calcium handling are discussed.

experimental procedures

materials
pn was synthesized according to koppenol et al. (23) and provided by
drs. j. s. beckman and r. kissner and stored at 280 °c. its concentration was determined photometrically at 302 nm in 0.1 m sodium
hydroxide (em 5 1.67) daily before use. buffers and salts were purchased from sigma, and nucleotide phosphates were from boehringer
mannheim. chicken hearts were freshly obtained from a local poultry
slaughterhouse and transported on ice.

results and discussion

the sensitivity of mi-ck toward pn was tested at increasing
levels of complexity. purified mi-ck (fig. 1) was inactivated to
more than 90% at concentrations of 200 mm pn, and the inactivation plot was monophasic with an ic50 of 35 mm. inactivation was reduced by 10 mm edta (fig. 1), likely because it
competes for pn with the enzyme (edta can undergo oxidative
decarboxylation). preincubation of the enzyme with 1 mm  xxxd26xxx 
also significantly reduced mi-ck inactivation (fig. 1), indicating the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the inactivation
reaction, a phenomenon that also has been shown for the superoxide-induced inactivation of mi-ck (12). a full protection
of mi-ck by  xxxd26xxx  could not be achieved, showing a certain
specificity of pn for target residues of the enzyme. indeed,
there was only a partial reactivation (regain of maximally 22%
enzyme activity) of mi-ck upon the addition of  xxxd26xxx  to the
pn-inactivated enzyme (fig. 2), which also proved the irreversibility of some modifications. a most likely candidate out of the
8 sulfhydryl groups per mi-ck monomer is cys-278, which is
conserved in all known ck sequences. this residue was shown
to be highly reactive and may serve as a “hinge” between both
substrate binding sites conferring synergistic substrate binding but is not directly involved in catalysis (16). however, a
striking loss in enzymatic activity was observed when replacing the cysteine residue (cys-278 is deprotonated in the active
enzyme) with uncharged residues like glycine. the missing
negative charge in the mutant enzyme can be partially replaced by cl2 ions, which leads to a severalfold increase in
activity as well as the replacement of the uncharged amino acid
in the cys-278 mutant by the corresponding negatively charged
amino acid (16).
when pn was added to mitoplasts, the inactivation of mi-ck
was biphasic, with ic50 values of about 30 and 60 mm (fig. 3).
in the absence of the outer mitochondrial membrane, there is
probably a partial release of tightly bound ck from the high

overexpression and isolation of mi-ck—chicken  xxxg470xxx  ( xxxg470xxx ) was produced by overexpression of
the prf23 vector in the escherichia coli strain bl21(de3)plyss. the
protein (specific activity 5 120 units/mg) was purified by a combination
of blue-sepharose affinity chromatography and cation exchange chromatography on a mono s hr5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography
column (amersham pharmacia biotech) as described by furter and
colleagues (24). concentrated  xxxg470xxx  (5 mg/ml) was stored in mono s
elution buffer at 280 °c. ck activity was measured by the ph-stat
assay (25) determining the rate of atp formation (reverse reaction). for
substrate protection assays, the mi-ck forward and backward reaction
was measured using a coupled optical test as described by wallimann et
al. (26). protein concentration was determined using the bio-rad assay
(27) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
isolation of mitochondria—mitochondria from chicken heart were
isolated by differential centrifugation after mechanical disruption of the
tissue in isotonic buffer (msh: 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm
hepes, ph 7.4) as described by kottke et al. (28). mitoplasts were
generated by swelling of isolated mitochondria in water for 5 min at
4 °c. mitoplasts were sedimented, washed, and resuspended in the
appropriate buffer/water.
respirometry—respiration measurements were performed with a
cyclobios oxygraph (a. paar, innsbruck, austria) at 25 °c in 2 ml of
msh buffer containing 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm egta, 10 mm napi,, and 5
mm rotenone. mitochondria with a total protein content of 150 mg were
used for each experiment. peroxynitrite at a final concentration of 350
mm was administered to the mitochondria before succinate (final concentration 5 mm) was added to initiate state 4 respiration. stimulation
of oxidative phosphorylation was achieved by administration of 25 mm
or 1 mm atp (maximum state 3 respiration). oxygen consumption was
measured in the presence or absence of 17 mm creatine.
fluorescence measurements—fluorescence emission spectra were
obtained using a spex fluorolog-2 instrument. fluorescence intensity
was measured with a single photon counter equipped with a peltier
cooling unit. the excitation wavelength was set to 287 nm (mi-ck-trp
excitation maximum), and detection wavelength was varied from 300 to
500 nm, with 1-nm increments. the protein concentration was 0.15 mm.
the excitation slit width was set to 0.7 nm, and the emission slit width
was set to 1.7 nm. all measurements were carried out at 25 °c in a
stirred 1-cm quartz cuvette put into a thermostated sample holder. the
buffer used was 10 mm tes, 50 mm nacl.
peroxynitrite administration—pn was diluted in 0.1 m naoh and
added under extensive stirring to the mi-ck (or mitochondrial) solution. as a control, the same amounts of naoh without pn were added.
mi-ck inactivation experiments were carried out in phosphate-buffered
saline (150 mm nacl, 10 mm napi, ph 7.2), mitochondria were suspended in msh buffer, mitoplasts in h2o (ultrapure). whenever possible, the presence of 2- xxxd26xxx  ( xxxd26xxx ) in the buffer was
avoided (it competes with protein sh groups for pn), except for respiration measurements, where a reducing environment was necessary to
keep mitochondria active.
octamer dissociation—to achieve octamer dissociation, mi-ck stock
solution (.95% octamers) was incubated in tsac mixture (transition
state analog complex; final concentrations: 4 mm adp; 5 mm mgcl2, 20
mm creatine, 50 mm kno3) and the respective buffer at a protein
concentration of 0.2 mg/ml for at least 2 h at 4 °c.
in detail, a solution of octameric mi-ck (0.2 mg/ml) was made 500 mm
in pn. after reaction for 5 min, tsac reagents were added to one
aliquot, and the mixture was left at 4 °c for 2 h before gel permeation
chromatography. untreated mi-ck, mi-ck treated with pn or tsac
reagents only, served as controls (see fig. 8).
gel permeation chromatography—the oligomeric state of mi-ck
was determined on a superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography
column (amersham) at 4 °c in running buffer (50 mm napi, 150 mm

affinity, inner membrane binding site to the low affinity, peripheral binding site (29), where the enzyme is more accessible
to pn and therefore easier to inactivate. rebinding studies of
octameric mi-ck to mitoplasts revealed a very tightly and a
loosely bound fraction of ck (30). similarly, binding studies of
mi-ck to model membranes (29) showed that in membranes
containing 16% cardiolipin, 66% of mi-ck stays tightly bound
under nonequilibrium conditions. this is close to the amount of
mi-ck (75%) that is more resistant to pn in mitoplasts.
in the presence of the outer mitochondrial membrane, i.e. in
intact mitochondria, mi-ck is less sensitive to pn inactivation.
there, initiation of inactivation requires more than 40 mm pn
and is monophasic, and ic50 is 200 mm (fig. 4). this finding
indicates that the outer membrane and its constituents effectively intercept some of the added pn, and that in mitochondria
all mi-ck may be present in just one binding state.
to further demonstrate the exquisite and specific sensitivity of
mi-ck to pn in mitochondria, we measured oxidative phospho-

rylation under conditions where provision of adp by mi-ck is
the rate-limiting step in state 3 respiration (fig. 5). the presence
of creatine strongly stimulates state 3 respiration. preincubation
of mitochondria with 350 mm pn completely prevents this stimulation but does not affect the respiration in the absence of
creatine. the latter is proven by the oxygen consumption data
measured for atp-stimulated respiration in the presence of succinate before (fig. 5, control) and after pn treatment (fig. 5,
pn), which are almost identical. in addition, the pn-treated
mitochondria still showed an atractyloside-induced decline of o2
consumption, indicating that mitochondrial respiration was still
coupled to atp generation. thus, oxidative phosphorylation is
not compromised by pn under conditions where mi-ck is inac-

tivated to about 70% as shown by the corresponding in vitro
inactivation studies in intact mitochondria (see also fig. 4).
these findings bear far-reaching consequences for the energy
homeostasis of a cell, e.g. mi-ck, which is primarily responsible
for the synthesis of pcr, is inactivated as a prime target of pn
and cannot longer serve this function. therefore, the cell becomes
depleted of pcr, which is used to maintain high phosphorylation
potentials at sites of energy demand and embodies an important
energy and ph buffer. regarding the ca21 handling capabilities
of the cell, a permanent loss of pcr, which is used by sarcoplasmic reticulum-bound ck to fuel the sarcoplasmic reticulum
ca21-atpase (31), may be fatal, as pn also stimulates the release of ca21 from mitochondria (3). both effects may lead to a
strikingly higher ca21 concentration in the cytosol and may
cause chronic ca21 overload, which can lead to reduced cellular
and mitochondrial function and eventually cause apoptosis and
necrosis (32,33).
the reaction of isolated mi-ck with pn was further investigated with biophysical techniques. we analyzed tryptophan
fluorescence, because tryptophan residues are essential for
mi-ck activity (trp-223; ref. 34), and oligomeric state (trp264; ref. 34). pn treatment lowered the intensity of tryptophan
fluorescence emission by 27% (fig. 6) without changing the
position of the emission peak, indicating that it was not solvent
exposure of internal tryptophan residues caused by unfolding
of mi-ck that was responsible for the reduced quantum yield.
these findings support the idea that a destructive interaction
between pn and tryptophan takes place, one example being an
irreversible oxidative ring-opening of tryptophan residues
yielding n-formylkynurenine. because mutants affecting trp223 were shown to be completely inactive enzymatically (34)
but here some enzymatic activity could still be recovered after
incubation of pn-treated mi-ck with  xxxd26xxx , presumably by
deblocking some pn-modified active-site cys-278 residues (fig.
2), the modification of the active-site trp-223 was not quantitative at the concentrations of pn used. thus, the inactivation
of ck activity observed under the conditions of pn treatment
described herein is due to a combination of modifications of
cys-278 as well as trp-223 active-site residues. we also found

were diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to increasing amounts of peroxynitrite; all additions were performed in time
intervals of 2 min. tyrosine nitration was determined in the absence
(triangles) and presence of 20 mm fecl3, 0.4 mm edta (squares) by
measuring the od428 readings for each titration step and calculating
the percentages of tyrosines nitrated. an extinction coefficient of 4.1
l/mmol cm for 3-nitrotyrosine was assumed for all calculations (35). all
values were corrected for dilution.

that the decrease in tryptophan emission intensity cannot be
ascribed to fluorescence quenching by nitrite, the major product formed when pn decomposes, by constructing the appropriate stern-vollmer plots (not shown). nitrite only contributed a few percent to the quenching, assuming the highest
possible concentration arising from the decay of pn. another
residue likely to be modified is tyrosine, which is converted to
3-nitrotyrosine after the addition of pn (35–37). as mi-ck
contains 11 tyrosine residues per monomer, we examined tyrosine nitration and calculated the percentage of modified residues (fig. 7). the data obtained suggest that under physiological conditions, tyrosine nitration is not the primary trigger of
mi-ck inactivation because a cumulative amount of 2 mmol of
pn was necessary to modify on average one tyrosine residue
per mi-ck monomer (10% tyrosine nitration). astonishingly,
the preincubation of the enzyme in 50 mm nahco32 (a source
for the co2 adduct of pn) did not facilitate the nitration reaction at all, in contrast to tyrosine in solution (36). nitration
yield was significantly enhanced in the presence of fe31-edta
(fig. 7), which is in good accordance with the results of ramezanian et al. (6), who demonstrated the high nitration efficiency of chelated fe31.
besides the inhibitory effect of pn on ck activity, this radical also drastically affected the octamer/dimer equilibrium, as
shown by gel permeation chromatography (fig. 8): although
native mi-ck was to 93% octameric, after pn treatment, the
octamer content was decreased to 83.7%, which could be caused
by modification of the tryptophan residue critical for the dimer/
dimer interface (trp 264; ref. 34). the tsac quantitatively
dissociates native mi-ck into dimers (38) by the induction of a
conformational change shown to take place as a consequence of
mg-nucleotide binding (39). when adding tsac to pn-pretreated mi-ck, the action of pn on mi-ck was most striking.
although the control (native mi-ck 1 tsac) dissociated into
dimers to an extent of 96.6%, the pn-exposed mi-ck almost
completely persisted in the octameric state (84.4% octamers),
i.e. at almost the same percentage that was determined for

peroxynitrite-induced inactivation of mi-ck

fig. 8. gel filtration profiles of native and pn-pretreated
mi-ck in the presence and absence of tsac. octameric mi-ck
was treated with 500 mm pm shortly before the addition of the tsac
mixture (transition state analog complex-forming reagents: 4 mm adp,
5 mm mgcl2, 20 mm creatine, 50 mm kno3), which usually induces a
fast dimerization of octameric mi-ck (see peak nr. 4 of control sample).
50 mg each of the protein samples (1– 4) were applied to a superose 12
column after a 2-h incubation (vol 5 23 ml), calibrated according to
described procedures (38), from which the mi-ck octamer and dimer
eluted at 11 and 13 ml, respectively. transiently generated tetramers
running intermediary between the two peaks shown in the figure are
extremely short-lived and can hardly be detected by this method (34,
38). note: pn treatment of octameric mi-ck alone after 1–2 h before
loading the sample onto the gel permeation columns induced a small
but significant spontaneous decay into mi-ck dimers (from 92.4 to
83.8% octamer content, compare peaks 1 and 2). however, tsacinduced dimerization via binding of the ck substrates to the active site
and thus inducing a conformational change (39), normally seen in
control mi-ck (peak 4), is completely blocked by pn treatment before
the addition of the tsac substrate mixture (peak 3).

pn-treated mi-ck without tsac. analysis of the pn-modified
protein on an sds gel showed that it was not due to covalent
cross-linking of mi-ck, because its monomer band was by far
most prominent (data not shown), although a small amount of
“artificial” covalently linked mi-ck dimers was detected. obviously, active-site residues like trp-223 and cys-278, which
have been shown to take part in the catalytic process, have
been modified by pn. as a result, tsac and the native sub-

strates of ck no longer bind properly to the enzyme and thus
are no longer able to induce the structural changes required for
dimerization (39). these results clearly show that the dimer/
octamer equilibrium of mi-ck, which is presumed to be important for the regulation of mi-ck-induced contact sites (40) is
severely disturbed by pn. more recent data indicate that at
higher concentrations of pn, mi-ck octamers spontaneously
tend to dimerize and that re-octamerization of pn-modified
mi-ck dimers is also affected.2 such data will certainly be
relevant for cellular energetics during ischemia/reperfusion as
well as with respect of the fact that mi-ck octamers, in the
presence of creatine or creatine analogues, seem to prevent
opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (52),
an early event of apoptosis.
to assess possibilities of avoiding mi-ck inactivation under
conditions of excessive no production and oxidative stress, the
protective effect of substrates was examined. for this purpose,
mi-ck was co-incubated with different substrates and combinations thereof and subsequently inactivated by pn (350 mm).
the data obtained (fig. 9) show no remarkable protection effect
for substrates and combinations that are not sufficient to keep
the enzyme working but bind to the active site (e.g. mgatp,
mgadp, pcr, cr), whereas the full set of substrates in both
cases, forward and reverse reaction, showed a highly protective
effect. these findings can be interpreted with respect to the
“hinge” function of cys-278 postulated by furter et al. (16). as
long as only the binding sites for atp/adp or pcr/cr are
occupied, no protection can be seen, because cys-278 is exposed
and not participating in the processing of substrate, as no
enzymatic reaction takes place. once the full set of substrates

is present, cys-278 is involved in the substrate binding sites
conferring synergistic substrate binding (16) and therefore in
contact with substrates. this leads to an enhanced protection of
cys-278 against pn. both directions of the ck reaction were
measured at their optimum ph and, in case of the forward
reaction (ph 8), the protective effect is lower, which can be
explained by the greater stability of pn at alkaline ph, which
gives it more time to find its sulfhydryl target before decaying
in solution. we, therefore, conclude that deenergization of mitochondria, resulting in a loss of atp, which is needed for pcr
synthesis in the intermembrane space, is detrimental to ck in
the presence of pn, as the enzyme becomes inactivated more
easily and therefore further compromises energy homeostasis
within the entire cell. consequently, this mechanism embodies
a vicious circle for all energy-demanding processes.
the concentrations of pn used in this study are well within
the physiological range. thus, a bolus of 250 mm pn is equivalent to the constant exposure to a concentration of 1 mm pn for
only 7 min (3, 41). the production of pn by activated macrophages inside phagolysosomes can reach about 500 mm (42).
the present results show that mi-ck is readily inactivated by
pn at concentrations that do not affect the activity of the
respiratory chain. we have previously reported that up to 500
mm added pn activates the specific ca21 release from rat liver
mitochondria, which operates with maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential (4). peroxynitrite, hitherto
mainly considered to be a toxic no congener (43), may thus also
be of physiological relevance. this is particularly important in
view of the fact that mitochondria are a copious source of o2.
(44, 45) and, according to most recent data, contain a highly
active  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (22, 53, 54). this makes it very
likely that in vivo they are primarily challenged by pn formed
within the organelles themselves. these data deserve full attention, because they may lead to a clue concerning the formation of the crystalline intramitochondrial inclusions (mainly
consisting of mi-ck octamers) seen in the pathological state of
patients with several neuromuscular diseases and mitochondrial myopathies (46 – 48) and to a better understanding of the
factors that trigger apoptosis and/or necrosis like the atp/adp
ratio (48) and the energetic state of mitochondria (33). some
important conclusions also arise for ischemia/reperfusion damage occurring after organ transplantation and episodes of hypoxia. it has been demonstrated that oxygen-derived radicals
attacking the cytosolic ck isoforms are involved in the irreversible cardiac tissue damage found in many patients after
ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (13,50) and that mitochondrial proteins are important targets as well (51). our data
clearly show that pn could be a potential culprit for causing
ischemia/reperfusion damage, as mi-ck, being responsible for
the maintenance of high phosphorylation potentials in the cell
(via pcr delivery), is challenged at quite low bolus concentrations of pn. our results seem also to be relevant with respect to
the recently discovered role of mi-ck in mitochondrial permeability transition, linking this enzyme and its substrates to
early events of apoptosis (52). thus, a search for compounds that
would protect cytosolic as well as mitochondrial ck isoforms
from inactivation by oxygen-derived free radicals and that could
be supplied with perfusion media may represent a future
achievement of possible clinical relevance.
