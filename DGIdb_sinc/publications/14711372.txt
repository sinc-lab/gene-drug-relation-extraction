 xxxg508xxx  (carnitine palmitoyltransferase i) catalyses the conversion
of  xxxd2832xxx -coa into palmitoylcarnitine in the presence of lcarnitine, facilitating the entry of  xxxd2154xxx  into mitochondria.
we propose a 3-d (three-dimensional) structural model for lcpt i (liver  xxxg508xxx ), based on the similarity of this enzyme to the
recently crystallized mouse  xxxg513xxx . the model
includes 607 of the 773 amino acids of l- xxxg508xxx , and the positions
of carnitine, coa and the  xxxd2832xxx  group were assigned by
superposition and docking analysis. functional analysis of this
3-d model included the mutagenesis of several amino acids in
order to identify putative catalytic residues. mutants d477a,
d567a and e590d showed reduced l- xxxg508xxx  activity. in addition,
individual mutation of amino acids forming the conserved ser685 -

thr686 -ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants t686a
and s687a and altered k m and the catalytic efficiency for carnitine
in mutant s685a. we conclude that the catalytic residues are
his473 and asp477 , while ser687 probably stabilizes the transition
state. several conserved lysines, i.e. lys455 , lys505 , lys560 and
lys561 , were also mutated. only mutants k455a and k560a
showed decreases in activity of 50 %. the model rationalizes
the finding of nine natural mutations in patients with hereditary
l- xxxg508xxx  deficiencies.

introduction

residue is known to interact with an aspartate residue in catalysis,
constituting what is referred to as a catalytic triad, which also
involves either a serine or a threonine residue. the histidine
residue is critical in catalysis and acts as a general base [9]. in
 xxxg513xxx , the position of this histidine at the centre of the catalytic
tunnel allows access to both substrates, carnitine and acetyl-coa,
which lie on opposite sides of the tunnel [7]. the activated 3hydroxy group of carnitine, probably acting instead of the hydroxy
group of serine or threonine, can then directly attack the carbonyl
carbon in acyl-coa or  xxxd3156xxx , and the reaction can proceed
without the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. previous
site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated an
essential catalytic role for the analogous catalytic histidine in
l- xxxg508xxx , cot and  xxxg509xxx  [11–13].
early site-directed mutagenesis studies by mcgarry’s team
showed that two aspartic residues in  xxxg509xxx  (asp477 and asp567 in
l- xxxg508xxx ) are essential for activity [13]. in the human  xxxg513xxx  crystal
it was proposed that, in place of an aspartic residue, glu326 could
play the role of negative charge on the sole basis that it is very
close to the catalytic histidine [6,7]. asp477 in l- xxxg508xxx  is orthologous to glu326 in human  xxxg513xxx .
in the present paper we propose a 3-d (three-dimensional)
model for l- xxxg508xxx  based on the  xxxg513xxx  crystal. the model is
validated by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids putatively
involved in catalysis. our study demonstrates that mutation of
either one of the conserved residues asp477 and asp567 , which are
located near carnitine and coa respectively in the model, nearly
abolishes enzyme activity. in addition, we also explored the role
of the conserved motif ser685 -thr686 -ser687 [14]. thr686 and ser687
are critical, since their mutation to alanine abolishes enzyme

 xxxg508xxx  (carnitine palmitoyltransferase i) catalyses the conversion
of long-chain fatty acyl-coas into acylcarnitines in the presence of l-carnitine. this is the first step in the transport of longchain  xxxd2154xxx  from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix,
and it is the rate-limiting step in beta-oxidation, as  xxxg508xxx  is tightly
regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-coa, thereby
conferring on  xxxg508xxx  the ability to signal the availability of lipid
and carbohydrate fuels [1].  xxxg508xxx  has a critical role in general
metabolism in the heart, liver and pancreatic beta-cells, and is a
potential target for the treatment of metabolic disorders, involving
diabetes and coronary heart disease [2]. mammalian tissues
express two isoforms of  xxxg508xxx , a liver isoform (l- xxxg508xxx ) and a
muscle isoform (m- xxxg508xxx ), which are the products of two different
genes [3,4]. other members of this family are  xxxg513xxx  (carnitine
acetyltransferase) and cot (carnitine octanoyltransferase), which
use short- and medium-chain acyl-coas respectively as substrates. in particular,  xxxg513xxx  may serve as a buffering system to
maintain the appropriate levels of acyl-coa and coa in the
various cellular compartments [5].
the crystal structure of mouse and human  xxxg513xxx , alone and
complexed with their substrates carnitine and coa, has recently
been reported [6,7]. this information has provided critical insights
into the molecular basis for acyl-chain transfer and a possible
common mechanism among the wide range of carnitine acyltransferases. the mechanism proposed for catalysis by carnitine
acyltransferases is similar for a series of enzyme-transferring
groups, such as lipases, proteases, acetylcholinesterases and other
similar enzymes [8–10]. in all of these enzymes, a histidine

activity. ser685 may be involved in carnitine binding, as k m and
v max are modified in the mutant s685a. ser687 might contribute
to stabilization of the transition state, and asp477 , together with
his473 , could be involved directly in catalysis. mutation of residues
lys455 , lys505 , lys560 and lys561 , which have been suggested to
play a role in catalysis because of their reactivity to chemical
modification, affects activity to a lesser extent, and their role
could be mainly one of structural maintenance. we have also
localized in the model some mutations described for human lcpt i deficiency. the model could explain the changes in activity
produced by these natural mutations.
experimental
construction of the model

the structural model for  xxxg508xxx  was made using homology modelling procedures based on multiple alignment of the members of
the carnitine/choline acyltransferase family of proteins, including the known 3-d structure of mouse  xxxg513xxx  (protein data
bank accession numbers: free enzyme structure, 1ndb; carnitine
complex, 1ndf; coa complex, 1ndi [6]). the model for rat
 xxxg508xxx , residues 166–772, was built using the program swisspdb viewer and the swiss-model server facilities [15–18]
(http://www.expasy.org/swissmod/swiss-model.html).
the rmsd (root-mean-square displacement) between backbone alpha-carbons of the template 1ndb and the  xxxg508xxx  structural
model was 0.65 å (1 å = 0.1 nm). no further energy minimization procedures were applied to the model, and its structural
quality was checked using the what check routines [19]
from the what if program [20] and the procheck validation
program from the swiss-model server facilities [21]; briefly,
the quality values of the model were within the expected region
for protein structural models.
positioning of the  xxxd2832xxx  group in the l- xxxg508xxx  model by docking

the putative  xxxd2832xxx -coa binding site was modelled based on
information from docking procedures using the autodock [22,23]
and hex [24] docking programs. protein target and ligands
( xxxd2832xxx -coa and carnitine) were prepared using the autodock
algorithms addsol and autotors, and a global search was
conducted using autogrid and autodock (100 cycles). ligand
structures close to the original position for the coa molecule
in the pdb 1ndi structure were selected. the macromolecular
docking program hex was used to manually refine the position
for the acyl extension of the ligand molecule. ribbon plots were
drawn using rasmol [25] and the swiss-pdb viewer.
construction of site-directed mutants

plasmids pyeslcptiwt and pyeslcptih473a were obtained as
described previously [11]. plasmids pyeslcptik455a , pyeslcptid477a , pyeslcptik505a , pyeslcptik560a , pyeslcptik561a ,
pyeslcptid567a , pyeslcptie590a , pyeslcptis685a , pyeslcptit686a and pyeslcptis687a were constructed using the quick
change pcr-based mutagenesis procedure (stratagene) with
the pyeslcptiwt plasmid as template. the appropriate substitutions and the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed
by sequencing the inserts in both directions using an applied
biosystems 373 automated dna sequencer.
expression of l- xxxg508xxx  in saccharomyces cerevisiae

the expression of constructs containing l- xxxg508xxx  wild type and
mutants in yeast cells and the preparation of cell extracts were

c 2004 biochemical society

performed as described in [11]. s. cerevisiae was chosen as an
expression system for l- xxxg508xxx  wild type and mutants because it
does not have endogenous l- xxxg508xxx  activity.
determination of carnitine acyltransferase activity

cpt activity was determined by the radiometric method, as described in [11], with minor modifications. the substrates were
l-[methyl-3 h]carnitine and  xxxd2832xxx -coa. enzyme activity was
assayed for 4 min at 30 ◦ c in a total volume of 200 µl.
for determination of the k m for carnitine,  xxxd2832xxx -coa was
fixed at 135 µm. for determination of the k m for acyl-coa, the
carnitine concentration was fixed at 400 µm. k m values were
estimated by analysing the data from three experiments using the
program enzifit (biosoft).
values reported in the text are the means and s.d.s of 3–5
determinations. all protein concentrations were determined using
the bio-rad protein assay with bsa as standard.
immunological techniques

western blot analysis was performed as described [11]. the antibody for rat l- xxxg508xxx  was kindly provided by dr c.  xxxg1771xxx -buus
(université rené descartes, paris, france) and was directed
against a peptide comprising residues 317–430, in the cytosolic
catalytic c-terminal domain. in order to quantify the level
of expression, ecftm western blotting (using fluorescence
detection) was performed, and analysis and quantification were
carried out using the fluorescence scanning instrument molecular
dynamics storm 840tm .
results
structural model of l- xxxg508xxx 

the first structural model for l- xxxg508xxx , proposed by our group, was
constructed by threading or ‘remote homology design’ [11], and
was based on the 3-d structure of rat enoyl-coa hydratase, in the
absence of an appropriate reference crystal. since the crystals of
two members of the family, murine and human  xxxg513xxx  [6,7], have
recently been reported, we were able to design a more accurate
structural model of l- xxxg508xxx  by homology modelling, including
most of the protein sequence. the 3-d l- xxxg508xxx  model was built
from residues 166 to 772. the n-terminus cannot be modelled,
since it is absent from  xxxg513xxx .
the 3-d model of rat l- xxxg508xxx  is based on the structure of
1ndb, the free enzyme structure of mouse  xxxg513xxx . a multiple
structural alignment of several m- xxxg508xxx  and l- xxxg508xxx  enzymes
and the amino acid sequence of 1ndb is shown in figure 1.
a ribbon picture of the final model of l- xxxg508xxx , including the
putative location of the carnitine and  xxxd2832xxx -coa ligands, is
shown in figure 2. although the scaffold structure of the modelled
l- xxxg508xxx  is essentially similar to the one used as the template
(1ndb), some differences can be observed. first, between alpha helix
no. 12 and beta sheet no. 9 in the 1ndb structure, a loop was built
de novo for rat l- xxxg508xxx  due to the presence of some extra residues
in the sequences of the latter protein and of the other member of
the family, m- xxxg508xxx . an addition can also be observed between
beta strands 13 and 14, where two extra beta strands were built into
the loop in the new model. the structure of these two loops
should be considered to be less accurate than the rest of the
model, as they do not have a counterpart in the template structure.
numbering of the alpha helices and beta strands in the proposed model
was performed without changing the labels of the template.

1ndb (the mouse  xxxg513xxx  enzyme) were aligned as described in the experimental section. the secondary structure (ss) elements of 1ndb are numbered as described previously [6]. the modelled
secondary elements of rat l- xxxg508xxx  are also indicated (h, alpha helix; e, beta strand).

structural model of rat l- xxxg508xxx 

a proposed model for l- xxxg508xxx  is shown using the ribbon plot representation. secondary structure
elements are numbered according to the 1ndb structure, as in figure 1. beta strands are in yellow
and alpha helices are in blue. the putative sites for carnitine (black) and  xxxd2832xxx -coa (magenta)
are indicated.

the structural locations of carnitine and coa were obtained
previously for mouse  xxxg513xxx  [6] and were included in the pdb
structures 1ndi and 1ndf. in the structural model for rat lcpt i, the site for carnitine has been conserved without variation,
including the 3-d co-ordinates of the ligand in the new model
(figure 2). the location of the coa group of the palmitoylcoa molecule has also been maintained (figure 2). a schematic
drawing of the interactions between coa, carnitine and the
proximal amino acids of l- xxxg508xxx  that lie within a radius of less
than 5 å with respect to either coa or carnitine is shown in
figure 3 (upper panel). the catalytic his473 establishes a
hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxy group of
carnitine. asp477 , which presumably stabilizes the positive charge
of his473 , is in close proximity. the positive charge of arg655
probably interacts with the negative charge of the carboxylate
group of carnitine. thr602 and tyr589 are close to carnitine, and
they probably form hydrogen bonds with it, as reported for mouse
 xxxg513xxx . the amino acids of the tripeptide ser685 -thr686 -ser687 also
are very close to carnitine, and may participate in catalysis. several
other amino acid residues that are less than 5 å from coa are
shown in figure 3 (upper panel). these include glu590 , asp567 ,

a model is proposed for the positioning of the  xxxd2832xxx  part
of  xxxd2832xxx -coa in a hydrophobic pocket of l- xxxg508xxx  (figure 3,
lower panel). this is of greater interest than interactions described
for coa and carnitine, since positioning of the  xxxd2832xxx  group
has not been described previously. the pocket seen in  xxxg513xxx  is
not valid, since the  xxxd2832xxx  group is much longer than the acetyl
group and requires a different accommodation from that observed
in  xxxg513xxx . to adequately define the new binding pocket for this
long substrate, a docking procedure using the simulation docking
algorithms autodock [22,23] and hex [24] was used. the result
of the docking analysis indicates that the fatty acid extension of
the  xxxd2832xxx -coa molecule is included in a hydrophobic pocket
enclosed by alpha helix 12 and beta strand 14. figure 3 (lower panel)
shows the amino acid residues located within a radius of 4 å

around the  xxxd2832xxx  group. hydrophobic residues in helix 12 are
located on the same face of the helix, and point towards the three
consecutive glycine residues in strand 14. these three residues
(gly709 -gly710 -gly711 ) are present in all  xxxg508xxx  enzymes (l- and
m-isoforms), but not in  xxxg513xxx , in which they are modified to valmet-phe. it seems that these three small amino acids facilitate
access of the long-chain  xxxd2832xxx -coa to the pocket.
search for putative catalytic amino acids by site-directed
mutagenesis

it has been suggested that a triad of amino acids, comprising a
histidine, an aspartate and a serine, is present in the catalytic domains of several hydrolases and transferases whose mechanisms
of reaction are similar [9]. the putative catalytic histidine in lcpt i was assigned as his473 , since this residue is fully conserved
in all carnitine acyltransferases and its mutation to alanine

abolished enzyme activity [11]. moreover, his473 is located close
(2.8 å) to the s atom of coa in our l- xxxg508xxx  model. therefore
we explored the amino acid residues surrounding the carbonyl of
the  xxxd2832xxx  group in the 3-d model of l- xxxg508xxx . we located two
aspartates, asp477 and asp567 (figure 4), that could participate in
the catalytic event, since they are well conserved in all carnitine
transferases, cot,  xxxg513xxx  and  xxxg508xxx  (l- and m-), as well as in
choline acetyltransferases. experiments carried out with  xxxg509xxx 
showed that mutations in orthologous amino acids abolished
enzyme activity [13]. to explore the role of these residues in
the acyltransferase reaction, we prepared expression plasmids
encoding the mutant variants l- xxxg508xxx  d477a and d567a. the
constructs were expressed in s. cerevisiae and the mitochondrial
fractions were assayed for  xxxg508xxx  activity. this was nearly abolished in both cases (2 % of residual activity for mutant d477a
and 2.9 % for mutant d567a) (table 1 and figure 5a). since only
asp477 is close (4.1 å) to the catalytic his473 (asp567 is 13.1 å
from his473 ), we conclude that asp477 probably participates in
catalysis.

we also explored a possible role for glu590 of l- xxxg508xxx , since
mutation of the orthologous glu to asp in  xxxg509xxx  abolished enzyme activity [26]. therefore mutant e590d was expressed in
s. cerevisiae, and revealed 37 % residual activity (table 1 and
figure 5a). since glu590 is located 9.5 å from carnitine and 12.0 å
from the sulphur atom of coa in the model (figure 4a), farther
away than asp477 (4.1 and 4.4 å respectively), we conclude that
glu590 does not participate directly in the catalytic event, but
probably stabilizes, together with asp567 , the positioning of coa
on its site (figure 3, upper panel).
in the search for other residues that play a role in catalysis,
we examined conserved serine residues in all carnitine acyltransferases and choline acetyltransferases, and found a conserved
ser685 -thr686 -ser687 motif near the c-termini. localization of
these residues in the l- xxxg508xxx  3-d model near the catalytic
site and near both substrates, i.e. carnitine (ser685 and thr686 )
and  xxxd2832xxx -coa (ser687 ) (figure 4a), suggested that one
of them could participate in the catalytic process. to address
this, individual point mutants s685a, t686a and s687a were

catalytic efficiency affect the v max more than the k m for both
carnitine and  xxxd2832xxx -coa. overall, the lysines studied here
contributed less to catalytic activity than the other amino acids
assayed, such as asp477 , asp567 , glu590 , ser685 , thr686 and ser687 .
western blot analysis of wild-type l- xxxg508xxx  and the mutants
using polyclonal antibodies is shown in figure 5(b). for both
the wild type and mutants, proteins of the predicted sizes were
synthesized with similar levels of expression.
discussion

wild-type and mutant l- xxxg508xxx  enzymes
(a)yeast extracts (10 µg of protein) of wild type and mutant proteins were assayed for activity.
the activity was corrected for the level of protein expression of each mutant. (b) s. cerevisiae
extracts (60 µg) were separated by sds/page and subjected to immunoblotting using specific
antibodies. proteins used were l- xxxg508xxx  wild type (wt) (lane 1), h473a (lane 2), d477a (lane 3),
d567a (lane 4), s685a (lane 5), t686a (lane 6), s687a (lane 7), e590d (lane 8), k455a (lane 9),
k505a (lane 10), k560a (lane 11) and k561a (lane 12).

prepared and expressed in s. cerevisiae. mutant s685a showed a
decrease in activity of 48 %; its k m for carnitine increased 3-fold,
while its v max decreased by 20 %. with the t686a and s687a
mutants, enzyme activity was abolished and the kinetic constants
could not be measured (table 1 and figure 5a). since the side
chain of thr686 points away from the active site, the oh group is
unlikely to contribute to catalysis. it may, however, have a role in
positioning of the substrate on the two neighbouring serines, and
its mutation might disrupt the conformation of the enzyme in this
area, as was observed for  xxxg513xxx  [6].
several other residues have been implicated previously in
catalysis in other members of the carnitine acyltransferase family.
we explored the putative roles of several lysine residues. lys455
is a conserved amino acid 18 residues upstream of the catalytic
his473 and it was located proximal to the catalytic histidine in the
former l- xxxg508xxx  model. lys505 had been implicated in catalysis
in cot [27]. lys560 and lys561 are located in the proposed model
at 3.7 å and 11.0 å respectively from the 5 phosphate group of
coa (figure 4b). although only the first lysine of these two is
fully conserved in the carnitine acyltransferase family, we mutated
both residues independently, as resolution of the model does not
allow us to identify the best candidate. mutant k455a showed
altered activity accompanied by 70 % protein expression. thus
the activity of the mutant was 58 % of wild type (table 1 and
figure 5a). mutant k505a retained 69 % activity. lys505 is far
away from the substrates in the model. with regard to the other
two lysines (lys560 -lys561 ) proximal to the 5 phosphate group
of coa, mutation of the residue closer to coa had the greatest
effect on activity. mutant k560a had 53 % of wild-type activity,
whereas mutant k561a showed 85 % activity (figure 5a).
the mutants generated in this study which conserved measurable enzyme activity were assayed for determination of kinetic
constants. the k m values for carnitine of the lysine mutants
k455a, k505a, k560a, k561a differed little from that of the
wild type, but their v max values for carnitine ranged between 50 %
and 135 % of wild type. k m and v max for  xxxd2832xxx -coa were
similar to wild type. only the k560a mutant showed a decreased
v max (30 %) (table 1). it appears that those mutants with altered

the structural difference between l- xxxg508xxx  and other carnitine
acyltransferases is that the former contains an additional nterminal domain of about 160 amino acid residues that is not present in  xxxg509xxx , cot or  xxxg513xxx . this n-terminal region comprises
a cytosolic segment of 47 amino acids, and two transmembrane
regions. both the n- and c-terminal regions are projected into
the cytosol. the c-terminal region contains both the catalytic
and the malonyl-coa binding site, although there might be some
interaction between the n-terminus and the malonyl-coa site,
since mutation of specific n-terminal amino acids results in the
abolition of malonyl-coa sensitivity. the proposed 3-d model
includes all c-terminal domain amino acids from ser166 to lys772 ,
analogous to that present in  xxxg513xxx .
comparison between the 3-d model based on similarity to  xxxg513xxx 
and the model based on similarity to a fragment of enoyl-coa
hydratase

in a previous study [11] we proposed a 3-d structural model of
the catalytic core of the l- xxxg508xxx  and cot proteins, designed on
a threading procedure or ‘remote homology design’, taking the
crystal of rat enoyl-coa hydratase as a template. this model was
partial, since it comprised only 200 amino acids (co-ordinates
368–567) and could not show the carnitine binding site. in this
model, his473 of l- xxxg508xxx  was located very close to the sulphur
atom of the acyl-coa substrate, a result that supported the model
and offered a structural explanation for the catalytic activity in
which this histidine residue has been implicated.
using the data from the former model to find candidate residues
comprising the catalytic site, we chose two amino acids, asp421
and ser423 , both of which were modelled close to the acyl-coa
molecule [11]. mutation of either of these residues to alanine
did not affect catalytic activity (results not shown). these results
suggested that the previous model was inaccurate and that it
should be modified when new data were available to improve
the assignments of interactions between the various amino acids.
a careful measurement of distances of these amino acids now
reveals that they are far away from the catalytic site.
the present model improves on the previous one, since it
was constructed by direct homology: the template used was
obtained after crystallization of another member of the carnitine
acyltransferase family, in this case mouse  xxxg513xxx . the general
organization of the new model coincides closely with that of
 xxxg513xxx , but it contains specific arrangements, particularly those
referring related to the binding of the substrate  xxxd2832xxx -coa,
which is much longer than acetyl-coa. as shown in figures 2
and 3 (lower panel), the l- xxxg508xxx  model contains a pocket near
the catalytic site, which could accommodate the fatty long-chain
 xxxd2832xxx -coa. docking analyses using specialized algorithms
confirmed this possibility.
in addition to structural features, the 3-d l- xxxg508xxx  model
shows several functional properties that support its structure.
mutation of asp477 , asp567 , thr686 or ser687 practically abolished
enzyme activity. mutation of other amino acid residues produced

structural model of carnitine palmitoyltransferase i

partial decreases in enzyme activity, e.g. glu590 , ser685 and the
lysines studied in the present paper. these residues probably
play a secondary role, maintaining the conformation of the
positive charge distribution of beta sheets and alpha helices throughout
the molecule. ramsay and co-workers [27] had suggested that
lys358 of cot might be involved in the cot catalytic process.
localization of the analogous lysine (lys505 ) in the l- xxxg508xxx  model
and determination of enzyme activity of its mutant have ruled out
a probable role in catalysis.
proposed binding sites for carnitine and  xxxd2832xxx -coa

figure 3 shows a general arrangement of the amino acids involved
in the interactions with carnitine and the  xxxd2832xxx  group. we
chose these residues on the basis of four criteria: (1) the effects of
their mutation on enzyme activity; (2) docking analysis using the
specialized autodock algorithms; (3) their distance to the s atom
of coa in some cases, to several groups forming the  xxxd2832xxx 
molecule or to the various atoms of carnitine; and (4) the general
positions of similar residues in the mouse or human  xxxg513xxx  crystal.
arg655 , whose distance to the carboxylate group of carnitine is
3.7 å, probably forms a salt bridge with this group at the active
site (figure 3, upper panel). it was shown previously [28] that
mutation of the equivalent residue in cot to asparagine increased
the apparent k m for carnitine by 1650-fold. ser687 (whose distance
to the oh group of carnitine is only 4.3 å), mutation of which
to alanine abolished enzyme activity, is probably involved in
maintaining the proper conformation of the enzyme in catalysis.
it is noteworthy that the hydroxylated side chain of thr686 points
away from the active site, as is the case in mouse  xxxg513xxx . as
the ser685 -thr686 -ser687 motif has been observed in all carnitine
acyltransferases, it is possible that thr686 may help to maintain
the proper conformation of the enzyme in this area, particularly
that of ser687 , which may stabilize the transition state, as has
been pointed out for cot [14]. this effect is not observed for
the first member of the motif (ser685 ), because its mutation only
decreased enzyme activity by 50 %. other amino acid residues
(thr602 , tyr589 ) might also participate in positioning of carnitine
in the catalytic channel, in view of their small distances to this
molecule.
his473 is critical for catalysis, acting as a general base. its distance to the hydroxy group of carnitine is 3.1 å. since asp477 is
close to his473 in the model, and its mutation abolishes enzyme
activity, its role in catalysis is probably the stabilization of the
positive charge that develops after deprotonation of the substrate.
asp567 and glu590 might stabilize the position of the pantothenic
group of coa. lys556 and lys560 , which are located only 4.14 and
3.7 å respectively from the 3 phosphate group of the coa ribose
ring, probably interact with this group. other amino acid residues
might also participate in the positioning of coa in the catalytic
channel, as suggested for  xxxg513xxx  [6], including leu297 and ser565 .
figure 3 (lower panel) shows how the  xxxd2832xxx  group is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket. the  xxxd2832xxx  group does not
form a putative straight line with the coa group, but it bends
within the catalytic his473 into the direction of a hydrophobic
region. this is possible because at the beginning of the bend there
are three glycines (residues 709–711), which are small enough to
allow the hydrocarbon chain to enter the pocket. it is noteworthy
that  xxxg513xxx  does not contain this tripeptide; in contrast,  xxxg513xxx 
contains three voluminous amino acids (val, met and phe) within
this area. the hydrophobic pocket is located between amino acids
of helix  xxxg1956xxx  and the glycine residues of beta sheet 14. it should be
emphasized that immediately before val706 there is an extra loop
that is present in all isoforms of  xxxg508xxx  (l- and m-) (residues 693–
705) but is absent from  xxxg513xxx . all of these circumstances favour

ribbon plot representation of the proposed model for l- xxxg508xxx , as in figure 4. the positions of
l- xxxg508xxx  amino acids are indicated as spheres. see table 2 for further details.

localization of the  xxxd2832xxx  group in l- xxxg508xxx  and not in  xxxg513xxx ,
whose natural substrate is the coa derivative of the small twocarbon acid, the acetyl group. figure 3 (lower panel) also shows
that amino acids involved in the  xxxd2832xxx  pocket are hydrophobic
residues, i.e. val481 , trp485 , val488 , met489 and ala490 of helix 12
and val706 of the coiled turn, and that all are with 4 å of the  xxxd2832xxx  group.
small differences in catalytic mechanism among the various
carnitine acyltransferases may occur as a consequence of (1) the
different lengths of the hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acyl-coa
substrates; (2) the fact that the reaction of l- xxxg508xxx  is inhibited by
malonyl-coa; and (3) the fact that l- xxxg508xxx  is bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane, unlike mitochondrial  xxxg509xxx , which is
close to the inner membrane, peroxisomal cot or mitochondrial
 xxxg513xxx .
localization of amino acid residues involved in human  xxxg508xxx 
deficiency

the present model also provides a molecular basis for understanding the effects of human missense mutations in l- xxxg508xxx 
(table 2 and figure 6). the natural missense mutations have
been validated by heterologous expression in mammalian or yeast
cells. these mutations can be roughly divided into two categories,
depending on whether they affect the activity directly or indirectly.

the only known natural mutation (g710e) that decreases the
activity without changing the stability of the protein is localized
very close to the catalytic his473 , and the introduction of a negative
charge may impair the catalytic process. alternatively, mutation of
gly710 , which is one of the amino acids of the tripeptide putatively
involved in the opening of the  xxxd2832xxx  hydrophobic pocket,
to the more voluminous glu710 residue impedes the positioning
of  xxxd2832xxx -coa. the other natural mutations described in the
literature produce unstable proteins, and involve amino acids
located far from the catalytic pocket, such as cys304 , arg395 , glu360 ,
ala414 , asp454 , leu484 and tyr498 . the loss of enzyme activity
which causes the hereditary diseases is thus explained by a loss
of stability (table 2).
no natural mutation has been described in m- xxxg508xxx . thus
m- xxxg508xxx  deficiency, as a disease, has not been identified
hitherto. however, more that 150 families have been reported with
deficiencies in  xxxg509xxx , with a prevalent s113l mutation found in
50 % of mutant alleles. another 10 families with an infantiletype deficiency of  xxxg509xxx  have been identified; this deficiency
is lethal during the first month of life [34]. preparation of a 3-d
 xxxg509xxx  model based on the  xxxg513xxx  model is expected to explain
the molecular effects of these natural mutations.
