abstract
in the present study, we attempted to predict the risk of extrapyramidal
side effects of a selective monoaminergic antagonist, risperidone, by analyzing the
correlation between the dopamine  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and the degree of extrapyramidal side effects of the drug. the occupancies of d2 and 5-ht2 receptors at various
doses of risperidone were calculated by means of a receptor occupancy theory. the
extrapyramidal side effects after administration of risperidone were attempted to predict by theoretical analysis of the correlation between the calculated occupancies and the
evidence of extrapyramidal symptoms using a ternary complex model. the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis utilized the data concerning the pharmacokinetics of
risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  (active metabolite), their binding affinities with
d2 and 5-ht2 receptors, and the clinical evidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (extrapyramidal symptom rating scale: esrs), gathered from the literature. the mean
occupancy of 5-ht2 receptors after the administration of regular doses of risperidone
was suggested to be more than 90%, whereas the mean occupancy of d2 receptors varied
between 50 – 80%, depending on the dose. the correlation between the occupancy of d2
receptors and the extrapyramidal symptoms could be successfully analyzed with a
ternary complex model, showing the predictability of the model for the extrapyramidal
side effects of risperidone. since the estimated risk of the extrapyramidal side effects
varied with the dose, the present method of predicting the extrapyramidal side effects of
risperidone may provide a basis for developing a rational dosing regimen for the drug.

introduction
the major pharmacologic properties of currently
available antipsychotics, such as butyrophenone, phenothiazine, benzamide derivatives, and others, have
been demonstrated through inhibition of dopamine d2
receptors (creese et al., 1975, 1976; seeman et al.,
1975, 1976). risperidone, a novel antipsychotic drug,
blocks not only d2 receptors but also 5-ht2 receptors.
because the binding affinity of risperidone with 5-ht2
receptors is higher than that with d2 receptors, the
risk of its extrapyramidal side effect is considered to be
lower than that of other antipsychotic agents. there©

materials and methods
dopamine d2 receptors blockade alleviates psychosis
but produces extrapyramidal side effects (seeman et
al., 1974, 1975; creese et al., 1976; farde et al., 1989,
1992; seeman, 1992, 1995). therefore, it was assumed
that the extrapyramidal side effects of risperidone observed after its administration are related to the binding of d2 receptors by risperidone and/or  xxxd2830xxx . the relationship between the  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy and extrapyramidal side effects was predicted by analyzing the kinetics of binding of the ligands to d2 and 5-ht2 receptors by means of the following procedure. for the analysis, data concerning the
plasma disappearance and unbound fractions of risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  in human, their
binding affinities with d2 and 5-ht2 receptors in vitro,
and clinical scores on the extrapyramidal symptoms
rating scale (esrs) after administration of risperidone
to patients were gathered from the literature (ishigooka et al., 1991; mannens et al., 1994; schotte et al.,
1995; schooler, 1994; peuskens, 1995).
estimation of plasma levels after the
administration of risperidone
we performed a pharmacokinetic analysis of drug
concentration time curves of risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  after oral administration of 1 mg and
2 mg of risperidone by simultaneously fitting the data
to a one-compartment model, using a nonlinear leastsquares method (yamaoka et al., 1981). risperidone
and  xxxd2830xxx  pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by fitting plasma concentration
(c p ) to:

respectively. assuming that both substances act as full
antagonists on d2 and 5-ht2 receptors, a receptor occupation theory predicts the receptor occupancy, ⌽ (%),
to be expressed by the following equation (clark, 1926;

in this study, the k i values measured from the binding study using a radiolabeled ligand in rat brain tissues were employed as the respective dissociation constants (schotte et al., 1995). the juxtareceptor drug

because the plasma concentrations of risperidone

dose, linear pharmacokinetics were postulated for
these drugs (ishigooka et al., 1991).

analysis of the correlation between receptor
occupancy and extrapyramidal side effects
the correlation between the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
and the extrapyramidal symptoms was analyzed. it is
considered that after binding the  xxxg656xxx , risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  act on the  xxxd81xxx  cy-

y. yamada et al.

clase inhibitory system, coupling with the transmitter,
 xxxg1027xxx  (kapur et al., 1996). such being
the case, an analysis was performed with the ternary
complex model (leff et al., 1989; yamada et al., 1995),
which simplifies these relationships and allows evaluation of the correlation between the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and extrapyramidal side effects. in the theory of
the ternary, it is assumed that after the agonist dopamine ( a) binds to d2 receptors (r) of the postsynaptic
membrane, the pharmacologic effects occur when the
developed ar complexes further bind to transmitter,
 xxxg1027xxx  (t), forming the ternary complex
( art). although the antagonists (b), risperidone and
 xxxd2830xxx , also bind to the d2 receptors, the
developed br complexes cannot bind to t. consequently, the decrease in the amount of active art
complexes can be interpreted as the pharmacologic effects of b (e b ), that is, extrapyramidal side effects.
theoretically, e b can be expressed by the following
equation (yamada et al., 1995):

we predicted the occurrence of side effects after the
administration of risperidone at various doses by using

results
estimation of plasma levels after the
administration of risperidone
the plasma disappearance curves of risperidone after the administration of 1 mg and 2 mg of the drug are
illustrated in figure 1.
the symbols represent the values measured (ishigooka et al., 1991) and the curves represent the fitted
lines obtained from the kinetic analysis by using the
one-compartment model, respectively. the obtained
pharmacokinetic parameters are also shown in figure
1. the plasma levels of risperidone were well simulated
using the parameters of both the unchanged risperidone and its active metabolite.
analysis of receptor occupancy
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters used for the present analysis of receptor occupancy are listed in table i (mannens et al., 1994;
schotte et al., 1995).
the properties of the binding affinities of unchanged
risperidone and its 9-hydroxy metabolite to d2 and
5-ht2 receptors are similar, in that the affinities of
both compounds with 5-ht2 receptors were approximately 20 times higher than those with d2 receptors.
figure 2 illustrates the simulated time curves of d2
and  xxxg1113xxx  occupations after an administration of 2.5 mg of risperidone.

all the esrs scores after administration of risperidone showed a nonlinear concave elevation as the d2
receptor occupancy increased. the fitted lines obtained
from the ternary complex model corresponded well
with the observed values, suggesting that the extrapyramidal side effects after the oral administration of
risperidone can be estimated by a procedure using eqs.
1–5. among the obtained parameters shown in figure
4, all the t 0 values are less than the r 0 values, indicating the existence of spare receptors.

receptors after administration of 2.5 mg of risperidone.

prediction and assessment of extrapyramidal
side effects after administration of a regular
dose of risperidone
on the basis of the analytical results, we predicted
the risk of extrapyramidal side effects at the various
doses of risperidone.
after calculating the receptor occupancy based on
the dissociation constants, unbound fraction, and kinetic parameters of risperidone and its active metabolite, the extrapyramidal side effects after dosing with
risperidone was predicted by using the ternary complex
model. the estimated values of the extrapyramidal
side effects are shown in figure 5.
according to the results for these scores, the regular
dose range falls in the area where the curves incline
sharply, indicating that the risk of extrapyramidal side
effects could vary widely depending on the dose administered, even in the regular dose range.

fig. 3. calculated mean receptor occupancies after administration
of various dose of risperidone.

as shown in figure 2, the occupancies of both d2 and
5-ht2 receptors by unchanged risperidone differed
greatly from those by risperidone and its active metabolite, suggesting a major contribution of the metabolite
to the receptor occupancies after administration of risperidone. the mean occupancies of d2 and 5-ht2 receptors after administration of risperidone at various
doses are shown in figure 3.
in the therapeutic dose range of risperidone (2– 8
mg/day), the mean occupancy of 5-ht2 receptors
reached more than 90%, whereas that of d2 receptors
varied largely with the dose, even at therapeutic doses.
analysis of the correlation between receptor
occupancy and extrapyramidal side effects
the total esrs scores of the extrapyramidal symptoms, the ratings in parkinson’s symptoms, and the
deterioration in the ranges of parkinsonism/dystonia/
dyskinesia were obtained from previously published
clinical articles (schooler, 1994; peuskens, 1995).
these pharmacological measures of risperidone were
compared with the calculated  xxxg656xxx  occupancies;
the relationships are illustrated in figure 4.

discussion
since a drug action, whether it is desirable or not, is
generally triggered by drug binding to its specific receptors, receptor occupancy is considered an adequate
index to clinical efficacy and side effects. therefore, it is
important to clarify the binding kinetics at the site of
drug action. in the present study, the relationship with
the extrapyramidal side effect was assessed by the d2
receptor occupancy of risperidone by integrating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on a theoretical calculation. it was shown that the plasma kinetics
of risperidone can be analyzed by a one-compartment
model and that the contribution of the active metabolite to the calculated receptor occupancy is higher than
that of the unchanged drug regarding d2 and 5-ht2
receptors. further, after the oral administration of risperidone at the regular dose range the mean 5-ht2
receptor occupancy was ⬎90%, whereas the mean d2
receptor occupancy varied dose-dependently between
50 – 80%.
unavailability of human data prompted us to use the
k i values obtained from rat study in this calculation,
considering that membrane receptors are similar
among different animal species (sawada et al., 1997).
the k i value used of 3.3 nm for risperidone was measured using [125i]iodosulpride. although the k i value

scores and calculated  xxxg656xxx 
occupancies.

fig. 5. predicted values of extrapyramidal side effects of risperidone at various doses.

or the “ligand-independent dissociation constant” for
risperidone is actually closer to 0.3 nm (seeman et al.,
1996), the occupancies, however, are generally measured using radio-raclopride, so a further set of data
should be provided using a risperidone k i value of 1 nm
when competing vs. radio-raclopride. the  xxxd2830xxx  k i value when competing vs. radio-raclopride,
however, is not known. therefore, the k i values when
using [125i]iodosulpride were used for analysis. effective drug concentrations at the juxtareceptor were assumed to be equal to the unbound drug concentrations
in plasma. this is based on an assumption that only
the unbound drug reaches the intracellular space
around the receptors by passively diffusing through the
blood– brain barrier and immediately attaining equilibrium, because of the fact that no active transport system for risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  is known
in the brain and that this drug is highly lipid-soluble.
nonetheless, the above assumption should be confirmed by determining the concentrations using a microdialysis technique in the brain. currently, the calculated receptor occupancy is in agreement with the
finding of a human pet study (nyberg et al., 1993;
farde et al., 1995).
nonlinear concave relationships were observed between the calculated receptor d2 occupancies and the
extrapyramidal symptoms of risperidone, in which the

risks decreased reasonably as the  xxxg656xxx  occupancies decreased. in each rating score, the extrapyramidal side effects increased when the occupancies exceeded 70 – 80%. these findings support the results of
farde et al. (1995). as these relationships were analyzed by the ternary complex model, the predictability
of the occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects was
also suggested. it is known that, other than the d2
receptor blocking, 5-ht2 receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and the metabolic cascade of dopamine may influence the extrapyramidal side effect. it
has been reported, however, that the influences of risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  on the muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors and on the metabolic cascade of
dopamine are very low (schotte et al., 1995). conversely, it has been shown that 5-ht2 receptors interact with d2 receptors in such a way that the extrapyramidal side effect is relieved when 5-ht2 receptors
are blocked (kapur et al., 1996). since the  xxxg1113xxx  occupancies within the regular dose range of risperidone were suggested to be nearly identical in the
present study, we analyzed only the relationships between the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and extrapyramidal
side effect, assuming that an influence of the above
interaction is constant at least in the regular dose
range.

extrapyramidal side effects by risperidone

although it is generally recognized that the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects is low in the clinical use of risperidone, caution should be used with a
high-dose administration or titrating-dose regimen,
where the risk of extrapyramidal side effects may be
elevated precipitously. we think that the method of
estimating extrapyramidal side effects developed in
this study is useful for designing a rational dosage
regimen of risperidone.
