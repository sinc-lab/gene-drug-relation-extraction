streptokinase-induced platelet activation involves antistreptokinase antibodies and cleavage of  xxxg746xxx .  streptokinase activates platelets, limiting its effectiveness as a thrombolytic agent. the role of antistreptokinase antibodies and proteases in streptokinase-induced platelet activation was investigated. streptokinase induced localization of  xxxd2207xxx  to the platelet surface, platelet aggregation, and thromboxane a(2) production. these effects were inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the platelet fc receptor, iv.3. the platelet response to streptokinase was also blocked by an antibody directed against the cleavage site of the platelet  xxxg746xxx ,  xxxg746xxx  (par-1), but not by hirudin or an active site thrombin inhibitor, ro46-6240. in plasma depleted of plasminogen, exogenous wild-type plasminogen, but not an inactive mutant protein, s(741)a plasminogen, supported platelet aggregation, suggesting that the protease cleaving par-1 was streptokinase-plasminogen. streptokinase-plasminogen cleaved a synthetic peptide corresponding to par-1, resulting in generation of par-1 tethered ligand sequence and selectively reduced binding of a cleavage-sensitive par-1 antibody in intact cells. a combination of streptokinase, plasminogen, and antistreptokinase antibodies activated human erythroleukemic cells and was inhibited by pretreatment with iv.3 or pretreating the cells with the par-1 agonist sfllrn, suggesting fc receptor and par-1 interactions are necessary for cell activation in this system also. streptokinase-induced platelet activation is dependent on both antistreptokinase-fc receptor interactions and cleavage of par-1.
