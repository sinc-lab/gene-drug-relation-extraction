abstract
purpose  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ), a potent oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor against src and bcr-abl, has
recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (cml) in imatinib-acquired resistance
and intolerance. in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx  in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. possible
mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of  xxxd1815xxx  in animals were investigated.
methods metabolic stability of  xxxd1815xxx  was measured
after incubation with liver microsomes (either nadph- or
udpga-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from
mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. in all cases, substrate
depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling
factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1815xxx  were determined in mice, rats, dogs,

and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or
oral doses. in addition, the routes of excretion were
investigated after administration of  xxxd1815xxx  to bile duct
cannulated (bdc) rats. absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete
oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo
models like caco-2 cells, p-glycoprotein (p-gp) knockout
mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats.
results in vivo systemic plasma clearance values of
 xxxd1815xxx  were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse,
rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. scaling of in vitro
hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably
good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species.
percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in
mouse to 57% in dog.  xxxd1815xxx  showed high volumes of
distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding
values (>90%) in all four species tested. oral bioavailability of  xxxd1815xxx  ranged from 14% in the mouse to
34% in the dog. in rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial
administration. in bdc rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and
the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that  xxxd1815xxx  is
cleared primarily via metabolism.  xxxd1815xxx  has high
intrinsic permeability in caco-2 cells, however, the efflux
ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may
be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. however, in vivo studies in p-gp knockout mice versus wildtype mice showed no difference in the amount of  xxxd1815xxx  remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract,
suggesting that p-gp may not be responsible for the
incomplete bioavailability.
conclusions  xxxd1815xxx  shows intermediate clearance in
mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively
in those species. oxidative metabolism appears to be the

123

predominant clearance pathway. the incomplete oral
bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption
and high first-pass metabolism. however, the efflux
transporter, p-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting
oral absorption.

introduction
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a myeloproliferative
disorder that is caused by the bcr-abl oncogene [1, 2].
the current frontline therapy for cml is imatinib (gleevectm), an orally available inhibitor of bcr-abl [3].
however, acquired resistance to imatinib is a growing
problem, mostly due to point mutations in bcr-abl [4].
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx , fig. 1) is a novel, orally available
multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against bcr-abl that is
several fold more potent than imatinib, and also potently
inhibits imatinib-resistant bcr-abl mutants [5–7]. it has
been shown to be active in imatinib-resistant philadelphia
chromosome-positive leukemias [8].  xxxd1815xxx  also potently inhibits src kinase, a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  that
plays a critical role in the development, growth, progression, and metastasis of a number of human cancers [5, 9].
 xxxd1815xxx  has recently been approved for the treatment of
cml in imatinib-acquired resistance.
in this report, we describe the evaluation of  xxxd1815xxx  in
various preclinical species. in vitro and in vivo studies
were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics, oral
bioavailability, and metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx  in mouse, rat,
dog, and monkey. the routes of excretion of  xxxd1815xxx  were
investigated in bile duct cannulated (bdc) rats. absorption
and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability observed in the
different species, using various in vitro and in vivo models
like caco-2 cells, p-glycoprotein (p-gp) knockout mice,
and intra-portal dosing in rats.

incubations with nadph- or udpga-fortified liver
microsomes
the in vitro oxidative metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx  was investigated in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human nadphfortified liver microsomes. the liver microsomes were
purchased from in vitro technologies (baltimore, md,
usa). the rates of oxidative metabolism were measured in
duplicate under the following conditions:  xxxd1815xxx , 3 lm
final concentration (20 mm stock solution made in dmso,
final incubation solution contains 0.015% dmso and
0.985% acetonitrile); final protein concentration, 1 mg/ml;
nadph, 1 mm; ph 7.4 sodium phosphate buffer,
100 mm;  xxxd2532xxx , 6.7 mm. incubations were
conducted at 37c for 10 min and were initiated by the
addition of nadph. aliquots of the incubation were
quenched at 0 and 10 min by addition of two volumes of
acetonitrile. samples were analyzed using an lc/ms assay
and the percent metabolized was calculated based on the
disappearance of the parent compound.
 xxxd1815xxx  was also incubated with mouse, rat, dog,
monkey, and human liver microsomes along with cofactors
for glucuronidation. the experiment was conducted in
duplicate under the following conditions:  xxxd1815xxx , 10 lm
final concentration (2 mm stock solution made in acetonitrile); final protein concentration, 1 mg/ml; udpga,
30 mm; ph 7.5  xxxd3449xxx , 100 mm,  xxxd2532xxx ,
10 mm, alamethicine, 2.5 mg/ml. incubations were conducted at 37c for 60 min and were initiated by the addition of udpga. aliquots of incubation were quenched at
different time points by addition of one volume of acetonitrile. samples were analyzed using hplc with uv
detection and the percent glucuronidated was calculated
based on the disappearance of the parent compound.
incubations with hepatocytes
the metabolic stability of  xxxd1815xxx  was evaluated in
suspensions of hepatocytes isolated from mouse, rat, dog,
monkey, and human. mouse and rat hepatocytes were
prepared in-house as cell suspensions based on a literature
protocol [10]. the freshly isolated rat and mouse

cancer chemother pharmacol (2008) 61:365–376

hepatocytes were subjected to percoll purification by
centrifuging a mixture of cell suspension (12.5 ml) and
percoll solution (12.5 ml) at 50·g for 5 min at 4c. after
a further wash in suspension buffer (krebs-henseleit
buffer, ph 7.4), the cells were resuspended in the incubation buffer (krebs-henseleit buffer fortified with glucose). fresh dog and monkey hepatocytes were purchased
from cellzdirect corporation (formerly, cedra, austin,
tx, usa). cryopreserved human hepatocytes were obtained from in vitro technologies. the gel-entrapped
dog, monkey and human hepatocytes were processed in a
stepwise manner, according to the instructions provided
by the vendors, and washed in suspension buffer (krebshensleit buffer, ph 7.4), following which the cells were
resuspended in the incubation buffer (krebs-hensleit
buffer fortified with glucose). the incubations with
mouse, rat, dog and monkey hepatocytes were performed
with cells from one donor, whereas the incubations with
the cryopreserved human hepatocytes were performed
with a pool created from hepatocytes of three different
donors. cell viabilities, determined by trypan blue
exclusion, of the fresh hepatocytes were >75% and of the
cryopreserved hepatocytes were >60%.  xxxd1815xxx  (3 lm)
was incubated at 37c for 1 h, and aliquots of samples
(0.2 ml) were taken at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min. the reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of
acetonitrile. the incubations were performed in duplicate
at a cell density of 0.67 · 106 cells/ml in krebs-hensleit
buffer fortified with glucose, in an incubator at 37c, 95%
humidity, in an environment of 5% co2. the samples
were analyzed by lc/ms and the percent metabolized
was calculated based on the disappearance of the parent
compound.
metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx  by specific cyp enzymes
and fmo3 (reaction phenotyping)
reaction phenotyping studies were performed for  xxxd1815xxx 
using human cyps and fmo3 obtained from insect cells
that expressed a single cyp enzyme (supersomestm obtained from gentest co., woburn, ma, usa). the incubations were conducted using the following conditions:
50 pmol/ml cyp enzyme or 0.5 mg/ml of fmo3, 1 or
10 lm  xxxd1815xxx  (10 mm stock solution made in acetonitrile), 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm of nadph and 3.3 mm of  xxxd2532xxx .
after a 5 min pre-incubation at 37c the reaction was initiated by the addition of nadph and incubations were
conducted for a further 30 min. aliquots of the incubation
were quenched at 0 and 30 min by addition of two volumes
of acetonitrile. samples were analyzed using a lc/ms/ms
assay and the percent metabolized was calculated based on
the disappearance of the parent compound.

serum protein binding
the extent of protein binding of  xxxd1815xxx  was determined
in fresh mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human sera using
equilibrium dialysis. all experiments were done in fresh,
pooled serum (n = 10 for mice, n = 3 for rat, dog, monkey
and human) obtained from bioreclamation inc. (hicksville,
ny, usa).  xxxd1815xxx  (1 mm) in acetonitrile was added
into serum at a ratio of 1:100 to give a final concentration
of 10 lm. serum samples were dialyzed against 134 mm
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). the micro-equilibrium dialyzertm (500 ll chamber volume, amika corp., holliston,
ma, usa) containing spiked serum was incubated in a
shaking water bath maintained at 37c for 4 h. a
10,000 da molecular weight cutoff dialysis membrane
(amika corp., holliston, ma, usa) was used. all
experiments were carried out in triplicate. aliquots of
buffer and serum were taken at 4 h, and analyzed using an
lc/ms/ms method. the stability of  xxxd1815xxx  in sera was
also determined over the 4 h incubation period. from each
dialysis cell, the free and bound drug percentages were
calculated as follows:
% free = 100 · (concentration in buffer)/(concentration
in serum)
% bound = 100 – % free
blood cell partitioning
the extent of blood cell partitioning of  xxxd1815xxx  was
determined in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human blood.
all experiments were done in fresh, pooled blood obtained
from bioreclamation inc.  xxxd1815xxx  (1 mm) in acetonitrile
was added into blood at a ratio of 1:100 to give a final
concentration of 10 lm. samples were incubated at 37c
in a shaking water bath for 2 h. aliquots of blood were
removed at 0.5 and 2 h and the remaining blood was
centrifuged to obtain plasma. blood samples were treated
with a 0.5 volume of water and centrifuged to obtain
supernatant. all experiments were carried out in triplicate.
samples were analyzed using an lc/ms/ms method. a
blood to plasma partitioning ratio (cb/cp) for  xxxd1815xxx  was
calculated from the concentrations in blood (cb) and
plasma (cp). blood cell distribution was calculated from
the values of cb, cp, and hematocrit (hct) as follows:
% blood cell distribution = 100 · [cb – cp(1 – hct)]/cb
permeability studies using caco-2 cells
caco-2 cells (american type culture collection, rockville, md, usa) were seeded onto 12 well polycarbonate
filter membranes at a density of 60,000 cells/cm2. the
permeability studies were conducted with the monolayers
cultured for approximately 21 days in culture. the transport

123

368

medium buffer was modified hank’s  xxxd2988xxx 
containing 10 mm hepes. the ph of both the apical and
basolateral compartments was 7.4. the bi-directional permeability studies were initiated by adding an appropriate
volume of buffer containing  xxxd1815xxx  (final conc 50 lm;
20 mm stock solution made in dmso) to either the apical
(apical to basolateral transport) or basolateral (basolateral to
apical transport) side of the monolayer (n = 3). samples
were taken from both the apical and basolateral compartments at the end of a 2 h incubation period and the concentrations of test compound were analyzed for  xxxd1815xxx 
using an hplc method with uv detection. permeability
coefficient (pc) was calculated according to the following
equation: pc = da/(dt · s · co), where da/dt is the flux of
 xxxd1815xxx  across the monolayer (nmole/s), s is the surface
area of the cell monolayer, and co is the initial concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  in the donor compartment. the pc values
are expressed in nm/s.
the ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit p-gp was evaluated by
using the inhibition of the transport of digoxin, a p-gp
substrate, in caco-2 cell monolayer. both the apical to
basolateral (a-to-b) transport as well as the basolateral to
apical transport (b-to-a) of [3h]-digoxin was measured in
the absence and presence of  xxxd1815xxx . the transport
medium was hank’s  xxxd2988xxx , ph 7.4, on both
the apical and basolateral side. the concentration of digoxin used was 5 lm, and  xxxd1815xxx  was tested at two
concentrations (1 and 10 lm). verapamil, a p-gp inhibitor,
was used as a positive control in each experiment at a
concentration of 10 lm. the studies were initiated by
adding an appropriate volume of buffer containing digoxin
to either the apical (apical to basolateral transport) or basolateral (basolateral to apical transport) side of the
monolayer.  xxxd1815xxx  was added to both sides of the
monolayer. the monolayers were then incubated for 2 h at
37c. samples were taken from either the apical (basolateral to apical transport) or basolateral (apical to basolateral transport) compartment at the end of the 2-h period
and analyzed for total radioactivity. the a-to-b and b-to-a
permeability coefficient (pc) of digoxin was calculated in
the presence and absence of  xxxd1815xxx . results are reported
as percent inhibition of digoxin transport by  xxxd1815xxx .
in vivo animal studies
all procedures used for the animal studies were approved
by the bristol-myers squibb institutional animal care and
use committee.
pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability in mice
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1815xxx  were investigated in
female nude mice (harlan sprague dawley co., india-

123

cancer chemother pharmacol (2008) 61:365–376

napolis, in, usa). a total of 45 mice were divided into
three groups to receive one of the following treatments, a
single dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously (iv) and 5 mg/kg
and 15 mg/kg orally by gavage. the mice were fed ad lib
throughout the study. the vehicle used was propylene
glycol:water (1:1) for both routes of administration. serum
concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  in mice (n = 3 mice at each
time point) were measured at 5, 15 min, 1, 3 and 6 h after
iv dosing and at 15 min, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after oral dosing.
composite serum concentration-time profiles were constructed for pharmacokinetic analysis.
a study was conducted in wild type and p-gp knockout
mice (taconic, germantown, ny, usa) to determine the
amount of  xxxd1815xxx  remaining in the gastrointestinal tract
(git).  xxxd1815xxx  was administered to both groups orally at
a dose of 10 mg/kg in a 50 mm sodiun acetate buffer, ph
4.6. serum samples were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and
8 h post dose and gastrointestinal tract was collected at 8 h

homogenized with 3 volumes of water and 3 volumes of
acetonitrile per 1 volume of git. samples were analyzed
for  xxxd1815xxx  by lc/ms/ms.
pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability in rats
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1815xxx  were investigated in
male sprague-dawley rats following a single dose of
10 mg/kg either intra-arterially (ia) as a 10 min infusion
or orally by gavage. the intra-arterial route was chosen for
drug administration since blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained from the cannula placed in the
jugular vein. there were three rats per group. the dosing
vehicle used was  xxxd3034xxx :water (1:1). a second
study was also conducted in hepatic portal vein cannulated
rats (n = 3), where the rats were dosed intraportally (ipt)
at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 30 min infusion. the vehicle
used was 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.6. in both
studies the rats were fasted overnight and fed 4 h post dose.
blood samples were collected at 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6,
8 and 10 h after intraarterial, oral and intraportal dosing.
an additional 10 min sample was collected after intraarterial and intraportal dosing. approximately 0.3 ml of
blood was collected from the jugular vein in tubes containing edta and plasma was obtained by centrifugation.
urine was collected over the 10 h study period.
the routes of excretion and metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx 
were investigated in bile duct cannulated (bdc) rats following a single dose of 10 mg/kg either iv as a 10 min
infusion or orally by gavage. there were two rats per
group. the vehicle used was 50 mm sodium acetate buffer,
ph 4.6. the rats were fasted overnight and for the duration
of the study. urine and bile were collected over a 9 h
period. the gastrointestinal tract (git) and feces were

cancer chemother pharmacol (2008) 61:365–376

collected at the end of the 9 h study period. git and feces
were homogenized with 3 volumes of water and 3 volumes
of acetonitrile per 1 volume of git/feces. blood samples
were collected at 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 h after iv and
oral dosing in tubes containing edta and plasma was
prepared by centrifugation. all samples were analyzed for
 xxxd1815xxx  by lc/ms/ms.
pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability in dogs
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1815xxx  were investigated in
male beagle dogs (n = 3) following a single intravenous
dose of 1.2 mg/kg as a 10 min infusion and as an oral dose
of 3 mg/kg by gavage in a cross-over study design. the
vehicle used for both the iv and oral route was 50 mm
sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.6. the dogs were fasted overnight and fed 4 h post dose. blood samples were collected
 xxxd1891xxx , 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h after iv and
oral dosing. approximately 1 ml of blood was collected in
tubes containing edta and plasma was obtained by centrifugation. urine was collected over a 24 h period. samples
were analyzed for  xxxd1815xxx  by lc/ms/ms.
pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability in monkeys
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1815xxx  were investigated in male
cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3) following a single intravenous
dose of 2 mg/kg as a 10 min infusion or an oral solution dose
of 5 mg/kg by gavage in a cross-over study design. the
vehicle used for both the iv and oral route was 50 mm
sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.6. the monkeys were fasted
overnight and fed 4 h post dose. blood samples were collected  xxxd1891xxx , 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h after iv
and oral dosing. approximately 1 ml of blood was collected
in tubes containing edta and plasma was obtained by
centrifugation. urine was collected over a 24-h period.
samples were analyzed for  xxxd1815xxx  by lc/ms/ms.
sample analysis
samples from all the pharmacokinetic studies and samples
from the protein binding and blood cell partitioning studies
were analyzed by the following lc/ms/ms method. plasma or serum samples were treated with two volumes of
acetonitrile containing 200 ng/ml of the internal standard
(is, bms proprietary compound). after centrifugation to
remove precipitated proteins, a 10-ll portion of the clear
supernatant was analyzed by lc/ms/ms. bile, urine, and
gastrointestinal tract (git) samples were first diluted 1:10
in the corresponding blank plasma and followed by the
plasma sample extraction procedure. the hplc system
consisted of two shimadzu lc10ad pumps, a hts pal
autosampler, and a hewlett packard series 1,100 column

compartment. the column used was a ymc c18-aq,
2 mm · 50 mm, 3 lm particle size, maintained at 60c
and a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. the mobile phase consisted
of 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in water (a) and 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  in
acetonitrile (b). initial mobile phase composition was 85%
solvent a and 15% solvent b. after sample injection, the
mobile phase was changed using a linear gradient to 5%
solvent a and 95% solvent b over 1 min and held at that
composition for an additional 1 min. the mobile phase was
then returned to initial conditions and the column reequilibrated for 1.0 min. the total analysis time was 3 min.
the hplc was interfaced to either a micromass quattro
micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with
an electrospray interface, or a sciex api 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a turbo ionspray interface.
on micromass quattro micro uhp nitrogen was used as the
nebulizing and desolvation gas at flow rates of 100 l/h for
nebulization and 1,000 l/h for desolvation. the desolvation
temperature was 300c and the source temperature was
150c. data acquisition employed selected reaction monitoring (srm). positively charged ion representing the
[m + h] + for  xxxd1815xxx  and the is were selected in ms1
and collisionally dissociated with argon at a pressure of
2 · 10–3 torr to form specific product ions which were
subsequently monitored by ms2. all dwell times were
100 ms. the srm transitions monitored were m/z
488 ﬁ 401 for  xxxd1815xxx , m/z 459 ﬁ 338 for the is. cone
voltage was optimized at 45 v for  xxxd1815xxx  and 30 v for
the is, while the collision energy was 30 ev for  xxxd1815xxx 
and 20 ev for the is. the retention times for  xxxd1815xxx  and
the is, were approximately 1.0 and 1.2 min, respectively.
the sciex api 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
used the turbo ionspray interface with an ionspray voltage
of 4,500 v. gas 1 and gas 2 were set at 8 and 800,
respectively. the turbo ionspray temperature was set at
400c. the declustering potential (dp) was 41 v for  xxxd1815xxx  and 61 v for the is. the focusing potential (fp) was
170 v for  xxxd1815xxx  and 100 v for the is. the collision
energy was 41 ev and 29 ev for  xxxd1815xxx  and the is,
respectively. the nitrogen collision gas setting was 6. the
standard curves ranged from 1 to 20,000 nm. the standards
were analyzed in duplicate. quality control (qc) samples at
concentrations of 80, 800, and 8,000 nm were analyzed in
duplicate with the analytical set. predicted concentrations
of more than 80% of the qcs were within 20% of nominal
concentrations, indicating acceptable assay performance.
liver microsomal samples for determination of metabolic stability were analyzed using a high throughput lc/
ms assay. the hplc system consisted of shimadzu
lc10ad pumps (shimadzu, columbia, md, usa), and a
sil-10ad autosampler. hepatocyte samples were analyzed
by a lc/ms assay using a quattro ultima triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer interfaced to a waters 2790 gradient

hplc. samples from the caco-2 permeability and glucuronidation studies were analyzed by hplc-uv. the hplc
system consisted of the 2690 waters separation module and
a waters 996 photodiode array detector.
data analysis
plasma concentration data was analyzed with standard noncompartmental methods [11] with the kineticatm software program. composite plasma concentration–time profiles were constructed for pharmacokinetic analysis in the
mouse. the cmax and tmax values were recorded directly
from experimental observations. the auctot values were
calculated using a combination of linear and log trapezoidal
summations. the total body clearance (cl), mean residence
time (mrt), and the steady state volume of distribution
(vss) were also calculated after iv or ia administration. the
in vivo plasma clearance was converted to the blood
clearance using the cb/cp values obtained experimentally
for each species. the absolute oral bioavailability (%f) was
estimated by taking the ratio of dose-normalized auc
values after oral doses to those after iv or ia doses.
human plasma cl and vss values of  xxxd1815xxx  were also
predicted using allometry [12, 13]. allometric scaling was
done by fitting the relationship between the values of
plasma cl and vss found in animals (mouse, rat, dog,
monkey) and the body weight (bw) of the animal. the
equations used were: cl = a · (bw)b and vss = a ·
(bw)b where a is the allometric coefficient, and b is the
allometric exponent. the plasma cl was then converted to
blood clearance using the cb/cp ratio determined for
human.
the in vitro intrinsic clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  in microsomes was calculated as follows [14]: clint (ml/min/mg
protein) = rate/c, where rate is the rate of metabolism in
microsomes (nmol/min/mg protein), and c is the initial
concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  in the incubation. the in vitro
intrinsic clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  in hepatocytes (clint) was
calculated in a similar manner where clint (ml/min/million cells) = rate/c, where rate is the rate of metabolism in
hepatocytes (pmole/min/million cells), and c is the concentration of  xxxd1815xxx  in the incubation.
the in vivo intrinsic hepatic clearance of  xxxd1815xxx 
(clint,in vivo) estimated from in vitro hepatocyte incubations was calculated as follows [14]:

microsomal protein/g liver was substituted in the above
equation instead of 120-million cells/g liver. protein
binding in the incubation mixture or plasma was not
factored into these calculations. the hepatic clearance clh
was calculated from the following equation using the
well-stirred model:
clh ðml= min =kgþ ¼

qh  clint; in vivo
qh þ clint; in vivo

where qh is the liver blood flow of 90, 55, 31, 44 and
21 ml/min/kg for the mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human,
respectively [15].

results
incubations with nadph- or udpga-fortified liver
microsomes
in vitro studies in nadph-fortified liver microsomes
showed that  xxxd1815xxx  undergoes oxidative metabolism in
mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human and the in vitro rates
of metabolism when tested at a concentration of 3 lm,
were found to be 0.06, 0.13, 0.23, 0.13, and 0.22 nmol/min/
mg protein, respectively. these rates predict moderate
clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  in mouse, rat, and monkey, and high
clearance in dog and human (table 1). the rates of glucuronidation of  xxxd1815xxx  were determined in udpgafortified liver microsomes from mouse, rat, dog, monkey,
and human at a concentration of 10 lm and were found to
be very low at 0.024, 0.034, 0.029, 0.026, and 0.017 nmol/
min/mg protein, respectively (data not shown).
incubations with hepatocytes
in vitro rates of metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx  in hepatocytes
when tested at a concentration of 3 lm, were found to be
30, 49, 24, 20, and 26 pmol/min/106 cells in mouse, rat,
dog, monkey, and human, respectively. these rates predict
moderate clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  in all five species tested
(table 1).

of each cyp form in human tissue. all recombinant human
cyp isoforms tested in our panel appeared to be capable of
metabolizing  xxxd1815xxx  (table 2). some of these enzymes
are expressed extrahepatically and may contribute to the
total metabolic clearance. however, cyp3a4 is the most
abundant cyp form in human gut and liver and thus plays
a major role in the oxidative metabolism of  xxxd1815xxx 
metabolism. human fmo3 was also capable of metabolizing  xxxd1815xxx , however, its contribution to the total
turnover of  xxxd1815xxx  could not be estimated since the enzyme concentration in the incubation was not known.
serum protein binding
the serum protein binding of  xxxd1815xxx  was determined by
equilibrium dialysis  xxxd1891xxx  lm and was found to be 92, 97,
96, 97, and 94% in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human,
respectively. the stability of  xxxd1815xxx  was determined in

serum  xxxd1891xxx  lm for 4 h at 37c.  xxxd1815xxx  was stable under
these conditions in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human
serum.
blood cell partitioning
the extent of blood cell partitioning of  xxxd1815xxx  was
determined in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human blood at
a nominal concentration of 10 lm at 37c. the ratio of
concentration in blood to plasma (cblood/cplasma) was 1.2,
1.1, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.8 in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively, after a 30-min incubation. the hematocrit values were 0.31, 0.49, 0.43, 0.34, and 0.21, and the
percent distribution of  xxxd1815xxx  in blood cells was 43, 55,
57, 54 and 55%, in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human,
respectively.  xxxd1815xxx  appears to be equally distributed
between plasma and blood cells in all species tested.

caco-2 cells are derived from a human colon carcinoma
and grow to become a confluent monolayer on a semipermeable membrane. they become polarized and form tight
intercellular junctions, and thereby strongly resemble the
intestinal epithelium. the rate of passage of compounds
through the barrier is used to determine a permeability
coefficient (pc), which can be related to the in vivo
absorption of the compound. the pc of  xxxd1815xxx  in the
apical to basolateral direction was 102 nm/s at an initial
concentration of 50 lm at ph 7.4. this value is comparable to compounds that exhibit good absorption in humans. under similar conditions, the average basolateral to
apical pc value of  xxxd1815xxx  was 222 nm/s. the higher bto-a permeability resulted in a ba/ab efflux ratio of 2.2,
suggesting that  xxxd1815xxx  may be a substrate of an intestinal
efflux transporter such as p-gp.
to evaluate whether  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the transport of pgp substrates, the permeability of digoxin (a p-gp substrate)
was measured across caco-2 cell monolayers in the presence and absence of  xxxd1815xxx  at two different concentrations of 1 and 10 lm.  xxxd1815xxx  showed weak inhibition of

digoxin transport (10% at 1 lm and 11%  xxxd1891xxx  lm). this
level of inhibition is consistent with typical negative controls in this assay. the inhibition value for verapamil (a
known p-gp inhibitor) was 59%  xxxd1891xxx  lm in this experiment. these results suggest that  xxxd1815xxx  is unlikely to be
a p-gp inhibitor and may not alter the absorption and disposition characteristics of compounds that are p-gp substrates.

pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd1815xxx  in mice obtained
after single intravenous and oral doses are summarized in
table 3, and the serum concentration–time profiles are
presented in fig. 2. the systemic plasma clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  in mice was 62 ml/min/kg, which is equivalent to a
blood clearance of 46 ml/min/kg. the blood clearance of
 xxxd1815xxx  is ~50% of the hepatic blood flow of 90 ml/min/
kg in mice [15]. the vss was high (4.2 l/kg), greater than
the blood volume of 0.085 l/kg [15], indicating significant
extravascular distribution. the estimated half-life was
0.9 h and the mrt was 1.1 h. the oral bioavailability of
 xxxd1815xxx  in mice was 14 and 17% at doses of 5 and 15 mg/
kg, respectively. the tmax after both oral doses was 2 h.
the values for oral bioavailability are lower than those
previously reported [16]. although the reason for this
discrepancy in not obvious, the previous study used tumorbearing mice while mice used in this study were non-tumor-bearing.
to investigate whether p-gp plays a role in the incomplete oral absorption of  xxxd1815xxx , a study was conducted in
wild type and p-gp knockout mice (table 4).  xxxd1815xxx  was
administered to both groups orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg,
and git was collected at 8 h after dosing. the values of
cmax and auc were similar in the two groups of mice.
more importantly, the percentage of dose remaining in the
git was similar between the two groups suggesting that pgp does not play a role in the oral absorption of  xxxd1815xxx .

pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability in rats
pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd1815xxx  in rats after single
ia, oral, and intraportal doses are summarized in table 5
and the plasma concentration time profile is presented in
fig. 3. the systemic pharmacokinetic parameters have
been reported previously [5] are included here for completion and comparison to other nonclinical species. the
systemic plasma clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  was 26 ± 7.8 ml/
min/kg, which is equivalent to a blood clearance of 21 ml/
min/kg. the blood clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  corresponds to
~38% of the hepatic blood flow of 55 ml/min/kg [15]. the
vss was high (6.3 ± 2.2 l/kg), greater than blood volume of
0.054 l/kg [15], indicating significant extravascular distribution. the estimated elimination half-life was 3.3 ± 0.9 h
and the mrt was 4.1 ± 1.2 h. the oral bioavailability of
 xxxd1815xxx  was 27%. the tmax after an oral dose was
2.3 ± 3.3 h in the rat. the bioavailability after an intraportal dose of 10 mg/kg was comparable to that after intraarterial administration. in intact rats, the percent of dose
excreted unchanged in the urine over a 10 h period was
1.6 ± 0.5% after an ia dose of 10 mg/kg and 0.2 ± 0.04%
after an oral dose of 10 mg/kg. in bile duct cannulated rats,
the percent of dose excreted unchanged in the urine and
bile over a 9 h period was 0.8 and 9.6%, respectively, after
an iv dose of 10 mg/kg, and 0.4 and 4.7%, respectively,
after an oral dose of 10 mg/kg. the percent of dose in the
git at 9 h post dose was 3.5% after the iv dose and 33.4%
after the oral dose.

doses.

pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd1815xxx  in the monkey are
summarized in table 6 and the plasma concentration time
profiles are presented in fig. 5. the systemic plasma
clearance of  xxxd1815xxx  was 34 ± 4.1 ml/min/kg, which is
equivalent to a blood clearance of 23 ml/min/kg. the blood
clearance corresponds to ~50% of the hepatic blood flow of
44 ml/min/kg. the vss was high (3.5 ± 0.1 l/kg), greater
than blood volume of 0.073 l/kg, indicating significant
extravascular distribution. the estimated elimination halflife was 2.1 ± 0.1 h and the mrt was 1.7 ± 0.2 h. the
oral bioavailability of  xxxd1815xxx  was 15 ± 2.1%. the tmax
after an oral dose was 0.6 ± 0.1 h in the monkey. the
percent of dose excreted unchanged in the urine over a 24 h
period was <1% after both the iv and oral doses.
prediction of clearance and vss values in humans
allometric scaling by body weight was used to predict the
systemic plasma clearance and vss of  xxxd1815xxx  in humans
(fig. 6). the linear regression of clearance or vss versus
body weight, using data from mouse, rat, and dog, showed
very good correlations with a coefficient of correlation (r2)
of 0.99 for both parameters. the equation obtained after
regression was cl = 33.5 · (bw)0.90 and vss = 4.55 ·
(bw)0.98, giving a predicted systemic plasma clearance of
21.5 ml/min/kg and vss of 4.2 l/kg. this predicted plasma
clearance is equivalent to a blood clearance of 11.9 ml/
min/kg, which corresponds to ~57% of hepatic blood flow.
the blood clearance value obtained by allometry is comparable to the hepatic clearance estimated from human
hepatocytes (11 ml/min/kg) and slightly lower than that
estimated from human liver microsomes (16 ml/min/kg).

in vivo systemic plasma clearance values of  xxxd1815xxx  were

in the mouse to 34% in the dog. this incomplete oral
bioavailability could be due to poor absorption and/or
extensive first pass metabolism. in order to understand the

temic liver first pass metabolism was responsible for the
low oral bioavailability seen in rats. this was contrary to
the data obtained in caco-2 cells showing that  xxxd1815xxx  has
high intestinal permeability, and the data in rat liver microsomes and hepatocytes showing intermediate metabolic

cancer chemother pharmacol (2008) 61:365–376

rates suggesting the possibility of first pass metabolism.
high plasma concentrations seen after intraportal dosing
may have led to some saturation of first pass metabolism.
further studies in bdc rats showed that less than 15%
of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine,
bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that  xxxd1815xxx 
is primarily cleared via metabolism. this was supported by
the low urinary excretion of unchanged  xxxd1815xxx  in intact
rats, dogs, and monkeys. after an oral dose of 10 mg/kg in
bdc rats, 33% of the dose was found in the git as unchanged  xxxd1815xxx . the oral bioavailability depends on
absorption, metabolism in the walls of the git, and finally
metabolism by the liver before the compound reaches the
systemic circulation. thus, the oral bioavailability can be
represented as f = fa · fg · fh where fa = fraction of oral
dose absorbed, fg = fraction of oral dose that is not
metabolized in the git, and fh = fraction of oral dose
escaping liver extraction during first pass. assuming that
all of the 33% of the dose found in the git in bdc rats
was due to unabsorbed compound, 67% of the dose should
have been absorbed i.e. fa = 0.67. however, the oral bioavailability in rats was only 27% i.e., f = 0.27. assuming
no metabolism in the git (fg = 1), the fh is calculated to
be 0.4, i.e., 40% of the dose escapes liver first pass
metabolism. hence, of the percent of dose that was absorbed, 60% was metabolized in the liver before reaching
the systemic circulation. these studies suggest that the
incomplete oral bioavailability of  xxxd1815xxx  is due to a
combination of incomplete absorption and high first pass
metabolism.
p-gp is an atp-dependent efflux transporter that is expressed on the intestinal epithelial cells and has been
implicated in restricting the oral absorption of various
compounds thereby decreasing their bioavailability [17].
 xxxd1815xxx  had high intrinsic permeability in caco-2 cells
however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold
indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux
transporter. to investigate whether p-gp plays a role in the
incomplete oral absorption of  xxxd1815xxx , a study was conducted in wild type and p-gp knockout mice. p-gp
knockout mice and wild-type mice showed no differences
in the amount of  xxxd1815xxx  remaining unabsorbed in the
gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that p-gp may not be
responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. in addition,
 xxxd1815xxx  does not inhibit p-gp and may not alter the
absorption and disposition characteristics of compounds
that are p-gp substrates.
scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data
gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances
across all species. the systemic clearance in humans was
predicted to be intermediate to high, ranging from 11 to
16 ml/min/kg, based on in vitro human liver microsomal
and hepatocyte stability data, and allometric scaling using

375

clearance parameters obtained from four species. both
in vitro hepatocyte studies and allometry predicted similar
clearance values which were also reasonably close to that
predicted by in vitro microsomal studies. these results
demonstrate that for compounds like  xxxd1815xxx , where
metabolism is the predominant clearance pathway, a good
prediction of in vivo clearance can be obtained using liver
microsomes and hepatocytes employing a simple substrate
depletion approach. multiple human cyp enzymes appear
to have the potential to metabolize  xxxd1815xxx , and the major
route of hepatic elimination is predicted to be cyp3a4.
in summary,  xxxd1815xxx  shows intermediate clearance in
mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in
those species. oxidative metabolism appears to be the
predominant clearance pathway. the incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both lower absorption and high
first-pass metabolism. however, the efflux transporter,
p-gp does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.
acknowledgments the assistance of the technical support unit in
animal maintenance, dosing, and sample collection, christian caporuscio, bogdan sleczka, and georgia cornelius in lc/ms/ms
analysis, and the map knowledge centers in conducting some of the
in vitro experiments is greatly appreciated.
