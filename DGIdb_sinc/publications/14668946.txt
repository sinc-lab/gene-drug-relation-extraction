 xxxg1071xxx  as a drug discovery target.  the molecular mechanism for  xxxg1071xxx  ( xxxg1071xxx ) inhibition by  xxxd2735xxx , a recently approved new drug for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type i, has been satisfactorily explained by its action as an analogue to the substrate 4- xxxd40xxx . in addition, a novel induced conformationally restricted  xxxg1071xxx  inhibitor, diketonitrile, which serves as a nonclassical bioisostere for rigid cyclic 1,3-diketone derivatives, has been introduced. further application of the molecular mode of action of  xxxd2735xxx  in rational design of potential inhibitors for alpha-ketoglutarate-coupled dioxygenases is discussed.
