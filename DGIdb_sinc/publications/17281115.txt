activation of mitochondrial atp-sensitive  xxxg1232xxx  contributes to protective effect in prolonged myocardial preservation.  to find a better strategy for effective donor organ preservation, here we used a model of long-term hypothermia preservation of rat hearts to investigate the cardioprotective effects of  xxxd1868xxx , a selective opener of mitochondrial atp-sensitive  xxxg1232xxx  (mitok<sub>atp </sub>). cardiac function was impaired by 8-hour ischemic preservation following 30 minutes of reperfusion. treatment with  xxxd1868xxx  significantly attenuated the decline of myocardial contractility, and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase leakage and myocardial edema.  xxxd1868xxx  also prevented the loss of activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutases and sarcolemmal na<sup>+</sup>/k<sup>+</sup> atpase during ischemia or reperfusion period, respectively. these effects of  xxxd1868xxx  could be abolished by a selective mitok<sub>atp </sub> blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate. the results suggest that  xxxd1868xxx , as a supplementation in  xxxd2988xxx  solution, could enhance myocardial protection by opening mitok<sub>atp</sub> channel, and better maintenance of mitochondrial anti-oxidative enzyme.
