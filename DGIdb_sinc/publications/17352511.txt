abstract

there has been a real interest recently in developing once-daily  xxxg92xxx  agonists (ultra-long-acting  xxxg92xxx  agonists [ultra-labas]) for
treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in an attempt
to simplify their management, although an increasing amount of convincing data
show an association of labas with a rise in asthma-related deaths and lifethreatening experiences. this paper reviews the effects of different ultra-labas
that are at varying stages of development.  xxxd216xxx , carmoterol,  xxxd2342xxx 
and gsk-159797 are ultra-labas that are likely to be introduced into the market
before 2010. it is plausible that once-daily dose administration of an laba will
lead to increased convenience for patients, which may also lead to enhancement of
adherence, and may have advantages leading to improved overall clinical outcomes in patients with asthma and copd.

after the discovery of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol,
new candidate long-acting  xxxg92xxx  agonists
(labas) emerged, but research into labas became neglected after the development of picumeterol was halted in 1993.[1] picumeterol was able to
induce long-lasting relaxation of the airway smooth
muscle, both in vitro and in vivo in animal models,
but its bronchodilatation was not long-lasting in
patients with atopic asthma.[2] in addition, it did not
improve pc20 (the provocative concentration of
 xxxd2586xxx  causing a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [fev1]) when compared with placebo.[2]
nonetheless, labas are still central in the symptomatic management of asthma[3] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)[4] and, moreo-

ver, they should be considered when standard introductory doses of inhaled corticosteroids (icss) fail
to achieve control of asthma, before raising the dose
of icss. therefore, there has been a renewed interest in the development of new labas in recent
years, and now once-daily  xxxg92xxx  agonists
(ultra-labas) are in development in an attempt to
simplify asthma and copd management.[5] an important step in simplifying asthma and copd management and improving adherence with prescribed
therapy is to reduce the dose frequency to the minimum necessary to maintain disease control. therefore, the incorporation of once-daily dose administration is an important strategy to improve adherence and is a regimen preferred by most patients.[6]

long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists

lowest possible maintenance dose,[3] of icss and
other treatments, labas should not usually be
needed.[11]

unfortunately, there is an increasing amount of
convincing data that show an association between
the use of labas with an increase in asthma-related
deaths and life-threatening experiences.[7] in 1996,
as a result of reports of paradoxical bronchospasm
associated with the use of salmeterol,[8] and previous
epidemics of asthma-related deaths in patients taking other  xxxg92xxx  agonists,[9] the trial
known as smart (salmeterol multicenter asthma
research trial) was designed to randomise 60 000
asthma patients to either salmeterol 50mug twice daily or placebo.[10] following an interim analysis in
26 355 subjects, the study was terminated because
of findings in african americans and difficulties in
enrolment. the occurrence of the primary outcome,
respiratory-related deaths or life-threatening experiences was low and not significantly different for
salmeterol versus placebo (50 vs 36). however,
there was a small, significant increase in respiratoryrelated deaths (24 vs 11) and asthma-related deaths
(13 vs 3), and in combined asthma-related deaths or
life-threatening experiences (37 vs 22) in subjects
receiving salmeterol versus placebo. the imbalance
occurred largely in the african american subpopulation, which constituted up to 18% of the study
population (respiratory-related deaths or life-threatening experiences) [20 vs 5] and combined asthmarelated deaths or life-threatening experiences (19 vs
4) in subjects receiving salmeterol vs placebo.
as a consequence of the results from the smart
study and of the data that novartis provided for the
us fda advisory committee, which showed an
increased incidence of serious asthma-related events
in patients taking  xxxd2155xxx ,[11] the fda issued a
public health advisory to highlight recommendations about the use of labas for asthma.[12] in
particular, it was stressed that in patients with mild
to moderate asthma, icss should be used in sufficient amounts to control chronic symptoms.[11] if
symptoms cannot be controlled in this way, such
patients may also benefit from the addition of leukotriene-receptor antagonists or low-dose theophylline
therapy.[11] with an adequate dose, which is the

further alarms have arisen over tolerance to regular laba therapy and whether this reduces their
bronchoprotective effect and the efficacy of rescue
 xxxg92xxx  agonists when used for rapid relief
of symptoms. regular bronchodilator use is associated with an early decline in bronchoprotection but
not complete loss and, to a lesser extent, loss of
bronchodilation. theoretically,  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol might be expected to induce even greater
tolerance than the short-acting beta2-agonists because
of their longer duration of  xxxg92xxx  occupancy and probably downregulation.[13] in effect, the
regular use of labas is associated with the development of subsensitivity to their bronchoprotective[14-16] and bronchodilator[17-19] effects.

the concern about the regular use of labas in
asthma has been strengthened recently by a metaanalysis that has summarised data from 19
randomised, placebo-controlled trials involving
33 826 participants with asthma.[20] compared with
placebo, labas increased severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (odds ratio [or] 2.6; 95% ci
1.6, 4.3), life-threatening exacerbations (or 1.8;
95% ci 1.1, 2.9) and asthma-related deaths (or 3.5;
ci 95% 1.3, 9.3; risk difference 0.07%). risks were
similar for salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx  and in children
and adults.
despite all of the alarms raised by the smart
study and the other findings that we have highlighted, inhaled  xxxg92xxx  agonists remain the
most effective bronchodilators available for the immediate relief of asthma symptoms and, as such, are
an important component of asthma management.[3]
moreover, since icss and labas have a separate
but complementary role in the management of asthma, an laba in combination with an ics continues
to be the most effective asthma treatment.[3] nevertheless, polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoceptors can
affect regulation of the receptor, predisposing to
agonist-induced downregulation and desensitisation.[21] in particular, the homozygous arginine
genotype at position 16 of the  xxxg92xxx  may

have an impaired therapeutic response to salmeterol
in either the absence or presence of concurrent ics
use.[22] therefore, these specific patients (about onesixth of caucasians and one-fifth of african americans) might benefit from alternative asthma treatment strategies.
2. enantiomers of
 xxxg92xxx  agonists
the use of enantiomers of beta-adrenoceptor agonists should be an alternative option, considering
that the adverse effects on asthma progression with
regular use of  xxxg92xxx  agonists has raised
the possibility that they may be due to undesirable
effects of the accompanying (s)-enantiomer.[23] interestingly, it has been documented that the (s)enantiomers of salbutamol and  xxxd2155xxx  are able
to reverse the effects of the (r)-enantiomer and
dexamethasone, and this suggests suppression of the
anti-inflammatory effects, perhaps through an antagonistic mechanism similar to that of propranolol.[24] this is the reason why the once daily
approach has been combined with the enantiomer
issue.[25]
it is unclear whether the use of a pure (r,r)isomer will lessen this risk for asthma-related
deaths, because no published data have shown that
the use of active enantiomers can really influence
the safety profile of  xxxg92xxx  agonists.
nonetheless, it has been documented that lower
doses (than racemic salbutamol) of levosalbutamol,
the (r)-isomer of salbutamol, were effective in the
treatment of chronic asthma in african americans,
with a greater increase in trough fev1.[13] this is an
intriguing finding, given the probable introduction
before 2010 of ultra-labas, such as  xxxd216xxx 
(r,r- xxxd2155xxx ), carmoterol,  xxxd2342xxx  and
gsk-159797, which are active enantiomers.[5]
3.  xxxd216xxx 
 xxxd216xxx  (r,r- xxxd2155xxx ) is a single isomer
version of racemic  xxxd2155xxx  that contains two
chiral centres and is being developed as an inhaled
preparation for the treatment of respiratory disorders.[13] recently, it has been documented that the

single-dose bronchodilating effect of  xxxd2155xxx  resides in (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx .[26] consequently, it is not
a surprise that pure (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  provides
bronchodilation at lower doses than the racemate,
allowing for fewer  xxxg92xxx -mediated adverse effects. in effect, (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  has 1000
times greater affinity (2.9nm) to the human  xxxg92xxx  than (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  (3100nm), with receptor binding modulating intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  levels.[27] the minimum lethal
intravenous dose has been determined to be 100 mg/
kg for (r,r)- and 50 mg/kg for (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx ,
suggesting that the toxicity of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  may
not be related to the binding of the  xxxg92xxx .[27]
an initial clinical evaluation of  xxxd216xxx  in
asthmatic patients implied 24-hour duration of that
enantiomer at high doses.[28] nevertheless, another
study, which compared  xxxd216xxx  and racemic
 xxxd2155xxx  at the high (18 vs 36mug) and low (2.25 vs
4.5mug) dose levels, documented that bronchodilatation was clearly sustained beyond 12 hours, particularly at the high dose levels in patients with reversible asthma.[29] the differences between  xxxd216xxx  and racemic  xxxd2155xxx  at the high and low doses,
respectively, were not statistically significant (table
i). this finding indicates that it may be hard to
document a pronounced and clinically important
difference in duration of airway effects between
racemic  xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd216xxx .
interestingly, a crossover dose-ranging study of
 xxxd216xxx  in patients with copd,[30] in which
patients received nebulised  xxxd216xxx  at 9.6mug
four times daily, 24mug twice daily, 48mug four times
daily or 96mug twice daily, or placebo, documented
that all doses of  xxxd216xxx  significantly improved
fev1 over 24 hours (percentage change in fev1
area under the 24h-concentration-time curve
[auc24]: 13.8%, 22.4%, 23.1% and 23.1% for 9.6,
24, 48 and 96mug doses, respectively, compared with
2.3% for placebo), but also that there was no real
advantage in increasing the  xxxd216xxx  dose.
the efficacy of  xxxd216xxx  has been assessed in
copd patients in two identical, large, randomised,

improvement in fev1 after 12 weeks of daily administration (78.4–86.6%  xxxd216xxx , 56.1%
salmeterol, and 43.9% placebo). overall in these 12week trials, daily  xxxd216xxx  treatment was well
tolerated in patients with copd, although higher
doses of  xxxd216xxx  were associated with greater
 xxxg92xxx -mediated effects, but not copd
exacerbations or deaths.[32]
considering these data, it is evident that
 xxxd216xxx  has a longer duration of action than
currently marketed labas that require twice-daily
dose administration, but it is unlikely that the drug
will be approved as a once-daily dose administration
regimen.
4. carmoterol
carmoterol (chf 4226, ta 2005) is a pure
(r,r)-isomer and a non-catechol  xxxg92xxx 
agonist with a p-methoxyphenyl group on the amine
side chain and a 8-hydroxyl group on the carbostyril
aromatic ring (figure 2).[33] it possesses structural
elements from both  xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd3017xxx  and
binds very firmly to the  xxxg92xxx ,[34] a property shared by some other agonists that are also
based on a carbostyril skeleton.[35] in studies employing the chimeric  xxxg92xxx , the methoxyphenyl group in carmoterol has been found to be
critical to the beta2-selectivity of the molecule.[36]
4.1 experimental studies

carmoterol has been demonstrated to be a highly
potent and selective  xxxg92xxx  agonist (it has
53 times higher affinity for the  xxxg92xxx  than

for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor,[37] and is about five times
more selective for the beta2-adrenoceptors present in
the tracheal preparation than those mediating chronotropic response in the right atrium[36]). moreover,
it displays a fast onset and long duration of activity
in both in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions.[33,34,38]
carmoterol is more potent than other labas
such as  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol in  xxxd2586xxx 
precontracted guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle.[33,34,39] in this in vitro assay, both carmoterol and
 xxxd2155xxx  are active in the nano millilitre range,
whereas salmeterol is active only in the micro millilitre range. carmoterol has a similar onset of action
compared with salbutamol and  xxxd2155xxx , and a
faster onset of action compared with salmeterol.
furthermore, the duration of tracheal smooth muscle
relaxation is longer for carmoterol compared with
both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol.[39]
4.2 clinical studies

the results obtained in healthy volunteers and
asthmatic patients provided evidence that the
pharmacokinetics of carmoterol are proportional to
the dose, and that non-linear accumulation of the
drug after repeated dose treatments is negligible.[40]
a dose escalating study performed in volunteers
with asthma who inhaled five different doses
(0.5–3mug) documented a clear separation in terms of
fev1 effect between the lower (0.5mug, 1mug ) and the
higher doses (1.5mug, 2mug and 3mug), with the higher
1

doses eliciting clinically meaningful fev1 increases
over the 24 hours.[41] another escalating single inhaled dose comparison (1–16mug) performed in
healthy volunteers showed that only the highest
doses (12 and 16mug) resulted in an increase in heart
rate (approximately 5 and 10 beats per minute
[bpm], respectively) and maximum changes in corrected qt interval index (qtci) relative to baseline
remained similar to placebo for doses up to 12mug
during the first 4 hours post-dose.[42] interestingly,
using modulite™ 1 technology that utilises a
hydrofluoroalkane (hfa) propellant, a lung deposition of carmoterol as high as 41% of the nominal
dose can be reached.[43] because of the small particle
size of the hfa pmdi aerosol (0.8mum), no significant differences in lung deposition of carmoterol
between healthy subjects, patients with asthma and
patients with copd have been documented.[43] this
finding supports the effectiveness and the safety
profile of carmoterol.
a randomised, double-blind, parallel group trial
in 124 patients with persistent asthma documented
that carmoterol 2mug administered once daily was as
effective as  xxxd2155xxx  12mug twice daily over an
8-day treatment period (figure 3).[44] safety and
tolerability results were similar between carmoterol
and  xxxd2155xxx .[45]
4.3 combination products

several options for combination products are currently being evaluated in parallel. recently, evidence has been provided of a positive interaction of
carmoterol and tiotropium bromide in the control of
airway changes induced in guinea pigs by different
challenges, anaphylactic reaction included.[46] in
particular, in the presence of doses of tiotropium that
were ineffective per se, the ed50 values of
carmoterol were significantly reduced by 5- to
>30-fold, depending on the challenge. interestingly,
even parameters not directly linked to airway
smooth muscle relaxation, such as thromboxane a2
release and survival time, were significantly modified by the combination. these findings suggest that

the use of tradenames is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement.

a carmoterol and tiotropium combination represents
a new therapeutic option for patients affected by an
increase in airway resistance.
a positive interaction of carmoterol with budesonide in the control of bronchoconstriction induced
by acetaldehyde in guinea pigs has also been documented.[47] intriguingly, carmoterol plus budesonide
was 2-fold more effective than the  xxxd2155xxx  plus
budesonide combination. this finding suggests that
carmoterol plus budesonide, by optimising the beneficial pharmacological potential of each agent, may
represent a new fixed combination in asthma and
copd management.

strated concentration-dependent inhibition of the
electrical field stimulation (efs)-induced contraction. however,  xxxd2342xxx  had a faster onset of
action than salmeterol and was comparable with
 xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol, whereas duration of action (time to 50% recovery from maximum inhibition) was similar for all compounds (>7 hours)
except salbutamol (18 ± 7 minutes).[50] also in isolated human bronchi, efs-induced contractions
were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner
by  xxxd2342xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx , salmeterol and
salbutamol, but  xxxd2342xxx  provided effective
bronchodilation with a longer duration of action
than salbutamol and  xxxd2155xxx .[51] moreover, at
resting tone, the onset of action of  xxxd2342xxx  was
not significantly different from that of  xxxd2155xxx 
and salbutamol, but was significantly faster than
salmeterol.[51] a further study, which compared the
properties of  xxxd2342xxx  with those of salmeterol
and  xxxd2155xxx  on small airways in precision cut
slices from human and rat lung, confirmed that
 xxxd2342xxx  behaves as a long-acting  xxxg92xxx  agonist with a faster onset of action than
salmeterol and a significantly longer duration of
action than both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol.[52] it has
also been shown that  xxxd2342xxx , in contrast to
salmeterol, does not antagonise the bronchorelaxant
effect of a short-acting  xxxg92xxx  agonist (table ii).[53]
5.1.2 in vivo studies

5.  xxxd2342xxx 
 xxxd2342xxx  ( xxxd2342xxx ) [figure 4], which has a
structure that is evidently based on that of carmoterol, is a once-daily laba in development for asthma
and copd.[48] it combines a long duration of action,
compatible with once-daily dose administration in
humans, together with a fast onset of action.[49]

nin (5-ht)-induced bronchoconstriction (24 hours
vs 12 hours).[50] in the same study, the ability of
 xxxd2342xxx  to significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit the
serotonin response versus time-matched controls
was also evaluated.[50] a head-to-head comparison
with salbutamol,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol was performed using doses that induced approximately 80%
broncho-protection for  xxxd2342xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx ,
salmeterol and salbutamol, determined at the 2-hour
timepoint. the rank of duration of action was:  xxxd2342xxx  (55±12% at 12 hours) ≥ salmeterol (71 ±
14% at 9 hours) >  xxxd2155xxx  (71 ± 12% at 4 hours)
> salbutamol (98 ± 1% at 2 hours).
in contrast, in a study in rhesus monkeys,  xxxd2342xxx  (12.5 mug/kg, nebulised for 10 minutes) produced similar inhibition of  xxxd2586xxx -induced
bronchoconstriction compared with  xxxd2155xxx  (1.2
mug/kg, nebulised for 10 minutes), with a maximal
inhibition of 70–80% lasting >3 hours, compared
with a 50% maximum inhibition following salmeterol (54 mug/kg).[54]
the risk of tachyphylaxis, or rapidly decreasing
response to a drug, was assessed in once-daily intratracheal dosing of  xxxd2342xxx  compared with
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol in guinea pigs. no
tachyphylaxis was demonstrated for  xxxd2342xxx ,

 xxxd2155xxx  or salmeterol (table iii), although significant improvement in protection against serotonininduced bronchoconstriction was demonstrated after
5-day dosing of  xxxd2342xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  (compared with a single treatment), but not with salmeterol.[55]
5.2 clinical studies

several trials have evaluated the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd2342xxx  in patients with asthma and
copd.
5.2.1 asthma

a randomised, double-blind, dose-ranging study
( xxxd2342xxx  50, 100, 200, 400mug or placebo) in 42
patients with intermittent or mild to moderate persistent asthma demonstrated that  xxxd2342xxx  was able
to cause an effective 24-hour bronchodilation within
5 minutes and a favourable safety profile with oncedaily administration. improvements in efficacy were
generally dose dependent, whereas safety and tolerability for all doses were similar to placebo.[56]
another study compared the bronchodilator effects induced by single doses of  xxxd2342xxx  400mug
via single-dose dry powder inhaler (sddpi) and
200mug via multi-dose dry powder inhaler (mddpi;
certihaler™) and placebo, with a 1-week washout
between treatments, in 25 patients.[57] the onset of
action with each  xxxd2342xxx  dose was rapid relative
to placebo, but fev1 was significantly higher (p <
0.05) for  xxxd2342xxx  400mug sddpi versus 200mug
mddpi from 15 minutes to 2 hours and from 5
hours onwards. at 24 hours post-dose, both doses

5.2.2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

 xxxd2342xxx  has also been investigated in copd
patients in whom 24-hour bronchodilator efficacy
was demonstrated, with a clinically meaningful
bronchodilator effect by at least 1 hour post-dose as
shown by fev1 and no evidence of tachyphylaxis.[62] in a study by rennard et al.,[63] 635 patients
with moderate to severe copd received  xxxd2342xxx 
50, 100, 200 or 400mug once daily via mddpi,
 xxxd2342xxx  400mug once daily via sddpi or placebo.
© 2007 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

all doses of  xxxd2342xxx  were associated with statistically significant dose-dependent improvements in
fev1 compared with placebo, starting from 5 minutes after the first dose on day 1 of the 7-day
treatment period. dose-dependent fev1 increases
were seen for  xxxd2342xxx  by the first timepoint (5
minutes) and at all timepoints on days 1 and 7 (p <
0.05 versus placebo, all doses). the treatment effect
persisted throughout the 24-hour dose administration interval, and increases in trough fev1 with the
200 and 400 mug/day dosages were classified as
clinically relevant (figure 5). forced vital capacity
(fvc) and forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of
fvc were also significantly improved by  xxxd2342xxx  versus placebo, and rescue medication use was
reduced. during an open-label extension period involving 263 patients, the effects of  xxxd2342xxx  on
fev1 were similar to those of tiotropium bromide.
this is a very interesting finding that warrants further investigation.
5.2.3 safety

in all studies,  xxxd2342xxx  was well tolerated at all
doses, with a good overall safety profile. single
 xxxd2342xxx  doses up to 2000mug in patients with
persistent asthma were not associated with any clinically significant changes in known class effect adverse events such as hypokalaemia, hyperglytrough fev1 difference from placebo (ml)

still significantly improved fev1 over placebo, although  xxxd2342xxx  400mug sddpi was slightly more
effective than  xxxd2342xxx  200mug mddpi.
in a further trial, 436 patients with persistent
asthma on a stable regimen of icss were randomised to treatment for 7 days with once-daily  xxxd2342xxx  50, 100, 200 or 400mug via mddpi,  xxxd2342xxx 
400mug via sddpi or placebo.[58] all doses of  xxxd2342xxx  provided rapid-onset, and sustained, 24-hour
bronchodilator efficacy with once-daily administration from day 1, with no loss of efficacy after 7 days
of treatment.
the efficacy of  xxxd2342xxx  in patients with asthma was further investigated in three multiple-dose
studies of 7, 14 and 28 days duration.[59-61] in these
studies, the 24-hour bronchodilator efficacy of  xxxd2342xxx  observed on the first day was maintained for
the duration of the studies, suggesting that regular
use of  xxxd2342xxx  is not associated with the development of tolerance or tachyphylaxis. in particular, in
a randomised, double-blind, four-period, incomplete
block, crossover study that investigated efficacy and
safety of multiple-dose  xxxd2342xxx  (100, 200, 300,
400 and 600mug once daily via aerolizer™ in moderate persistent asthma,  xxxd2342xxx  appeared to offer
fast onset of action, with a minimum of 30% of
subjects who received the 200, 300 and 400mug doses
showing a change from baseline fev1 of at least
12% within 5 minutes of dose administration.[59] a
change from baseline fev1 of at least 12% was seen
in 27% of subjects who received the 600mug dose.
moreover, for fev1 auc24 on day 7, all  xxxd2342xxx 
doses were superior to placebo (p < 0.05), and for
fev1 all  xxxd2342xxx  doses were superior to placebo
(p < 0.05) at most timepoints on days 1 and 7.

caemia, increased heart rate or altered qtc interval.[64] mean glucose was normal up to 600mug;
levels slightly increased in one and four patients for
1200 and 2000mug, respectively. mean pulse rate was
normal up to 600mug, increasing 11 bpm 4 hours after
1200mug and 12 bpm 2 hours after 2000mug (not
clinically significant). mean qtc was unchanged up
to 300mug, and increased 13, 24 and 31ms for 600,
1200 and 2000mug, which is well within normal
limits. no patient experienced a change in qtc
interval larger than the upper limit of normalisation.
a study that investigated efficacy and safety of
supratherapeutic doses of  xxxd2342xxx  1000mug compared with salmeterol 250mug and salbutamol
1000mug in mild to moderate asthma documented
that the sustained bronchodilation of  xxxd2342xxx 
1000mug was not associated with sustained systemic
adverse effects, in contrast to salmeterol 250mug.[65]
the safe profile of  xxxd2342xxx  was confirmed in
other multiple-dose asthma studies, in which  xxxd2342xxx  doses up to 800mug once daily for up to 28
days were associated with a good cardiovascular
safety profile and no clinically relevant effects on
blood pressure, qtc, glucose or potassium
levels,[60,61] although two patients receiving  xxxd2342xxx  200 and 600mug had a change >60ms in qtc as
calculated using bazett’s formula.[61]
all these data have not only shown the strong
efficacy of  xxxd2342xxx  in asthma and copd but
have also documented safety at high doses.
5.3 combination products

several options for combination products are currently being evaluated in parallel.  xxxd2342xxx  is
being developed both as monotherapy and as a
fixed-dose combination (qva149) with  xxxd2220xxx , a
long-acting anti-muscarinic agent for the treatment
of copd that has also been shown to be effective
over 24 hours after a single dose.[66] a combination
containing  xxxd2155xxx  and the once-daily ics
mometasone in a single inhalation device is also
under development.[67]

6. gsk-159797
laba compounds from glaxosmithkline and
theravance have been put into a pool for potential
development for clinical use. the compound
gsk-159797 (td-3327) is an ultra-laba for the
potential once-daily treatment of asthma and copd,
but its structure has not yet been disclosed. recently, a novel, highly stable, crystalline form of a
 xxxd2155xxx  derivative as a novel laba, with
processes for its preparation, compositions containing the  xxxg92xxx  agonist, and its use for the
treatment of airway diseases, has been claimed.[68]
the claimed compound is believed to be
gsk-159797.
gsk-159797 achieved the target increase in
fev1 throughout the 24-hour evaluation period in a
study of 38 patients with mild asthma following
single-dose inhalation. it was well tolerated, with no
increase in heart rate.[5] a placebo-controlled crossover study tested the bronchodilatory effect, safety
and tolerability of multiple-dose levels of
gsk-159797 administered by a dry powder inhaler
in 20 patients with mild asthma.[69] doses in the
anticipated clinical range produced clinically significant increases in fev1 through 24 hours, with little
change in heart rate. at 24 hours, 10 and 20mug doses
of gsk-159797 produced adjusted mean changes
from baseline fev1 of 460ml and 540ml, respectively, compared with a change of 130ml for placebo. the placebo-corrected mean maximum heart
rate increase over the 26-hour period of measurement was 1.0 bpm for the 10mug dose and 2.7 bpm for
the 20mug dose.
a phase iib programme has been designed to
assess the safety and efficacy of gsk-159797 as
multi-day administration in patients with mild to
moderate asthma and to assess potential commercial
dose administration regimens.
by december 2003, a next-generation, once-daily combination consisting of gsk-685698, a new
long-acting ics and gsk-159797 was stated to be
undergoing phase ii studies. gsk-685698 has
shown evidence of greater potency and the potential
for once-daily administration compared with existing treatments.[5] a combination with

gsk-233705, a new long-acting antimuscarinic
agent, that is being developed for once-daily treatment of copd is another possible option.
7. conclusions
once-daily  xxxg92xxx  agonists or ultralabas such as carmoterol,  xxxd2342xxx  and
gsk-159797 are under development for the treatment of copd[5] (table iv). these compounds are
prevalently (r,r)-isomers, because much of the
pharmacological activity usually resides in the (r)enantiomer, whereas the anomalous actions of racemic  xxxg92xxx  agonists are now attributed to
unsuspected properties of the (s)-enantiomer.[5] in
addition, the majority of these agents have a high
intrinsic efficacy and a quick onset of action. although a quick onset of action and a prolonged
24-hour effect are desirable in the management of
asthma and copd, the use of agonists with high
intrinsic efficacy may theoretically be associated
with a rapid onset of tolerance, a fact that may limit
their clinical use.[70] this fact needs to be taken into
consideration in the evaluation of new agents under
development. however, it is likely that once-daily
dose administration of an laba will lead to increased convenience for patients, which may also
lead to enhancement of adherence and may have
advantages leading to improved overall clinical outcomes in patients with asthma and copd. the only

limits set for the development of an laba with a
new product profile are medical needs and marketing opportunities.[1] any company planning to develop a new ultra-laba must consider very carefully the pharmacological characteristics of the
 xxxg92xxx  agonist component to understand
how it will fit into current treatment strategies and
whether it should be used only in combination with
other drugs.[71]
combination therapy with an ics and an laba
is now considered the gold standard for treating
patients with moderate persistent or severe asthma.[3] consequently, there is an interest in developing a once-daily combination therapy in an attempt
to simplify treatment even further, and also to overcome the loss of patent protection. new icss such
as  xxxd1690xxx  or gw-685698, which can be used
once-daily, have been developed or are in development has further supported the development of new
ultra-labas that can be used on a once-daily basis.
bronchodilators are still central in the symptomatic management of copd.[4] for this reason, the
current opinion is that it will be advantageous to
develop inhalers containing a combination of several classes of long-acting bronchodilator drugs in an
attempt to simplify treatment regimens as much as
possible. the investigational therapies for copd
discussed here have shown promising results. it is
likely that the development of once-daily dual-ac-
