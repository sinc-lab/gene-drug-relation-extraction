abstract: an assay of l-tyrosine (tyr) hydroxylating activity operating in lincomycin biosynthesis is described. the assay
development consisted of hplc procedure development, assessing the effect of reaction mixture components on non-enzymatic
dopa and tyr oxidation, and sample stability evaluation. the hplc procedure with isocratic elution and ﬂuorescence detection
was developed and validated. the method showed a wide linear range of dopa determination of 0.125–25 µmol/l with lower limit
of quantiﬁcation (lloq) of 0.125 µmol/l, rsd of 7.2% and accuracy of 101.7%. the studied linear range of tyr was
15.625 mmol/l to 500 mmol/l with lloq of 15.625 mmol/l, rsd of 1.1%, and accuracy of 98.1%. recoveries for dopa and
tyr were 100.66 ± 0.89% and 94.76 ± 0.94%, respectively. the inter- and intra-day accuracies and precisions were all within 10%.
samples of the reaction mixture were stable for at least 24 h at room temperature (rt) and 28 days at −20°c. the method was
tested for the enzyme activity monitoring in puriﬁed as well as crude preparations and enabled micro preparation of the enzyme
product during conﬁrmation of its identity. the inﬂuence of ph and  xxxd228xxx  content in reaction mixture was studied with
respect to non-enzymatic tyr oxidation. copyright © 2007 john wiley & sons, ltd.

introduction
dopa is formed by enzymatic hydroxylation of the tyr
aromatic ring. this reaction is not limited to simple tyr
molecules but also occurs in tyr-containing proteins.
for the most part, these proteins play a structural role
in the synthesis of biological material, including coral
reef structures (waite et al., 1992), eggshells, and adhesives produced by mollusks (waite, 1990). tyr hydroxylating enzymes utilize molecular oxygen as the
additional substrate and are widely distributed throughout
the phylogenetic scale. tyr hydroxylases ( xxxg2276xxx )
convert tyr to dopa in the biosynthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters in both vertebrates and
invertebrates (kappock and caradonna, 1996; hamdan
and ribeiro, 1998). these non-heme fe dependent
enzymes have an absolute requirement for reduced

pteridine cofactor (6r)- xxxd3166xxx  as
an electron donor. tyrosinases are cu-containing glycoproteins involved in the biosynthesis of widespread
melanin pigments (hearing and jiménez, 1987). the
enzymes exhibit  xxxg2367xxx  activity
( xxxg2367xxx ) leading, for example, from tyr to dopa,
and o-diphenol oxidase activity (ec 1.10.3.1), leading
to benzoquinonic structures, e.g. from dopa to dopaquinone. in plants, tyr hydroxylation has been ascribed
to polyphenol oxidases ( xxxg2367xxx  and ec 1.10.3.1),
cu-containing proteins, which are responsible for the
darkening of the damaged plant tissue (mayer, 1987).
their physiological functions have yet to be elucidated.
tyr hydroxylating activities were also described in
the biosynthesis of betalains (mueller et al., 1996) and
assumed in lincomycin biosynthesis (michalik et al.,
1975; neusser et al., 1998). a unique tyr hydroxylating
activity operating in the lincomycin biosynthesis and
ascribed to the lmbb2 protein has recently been
detected (novotná et al., 2005).
working on a tyrosine hydroxylating activity operating in lincomycin biosynthesis (novotná et al., 2005),
we were looking for a method which would match
two requirements, i.e. routine determination of low
dopa concentration in the presence of tyr excess in
complex biological matrix, and suitability for dopa
micro preparation for subsequent mass spectrometric
identiﬁcation.

assay of tyrosine hydroxylating activity

the traditional methods were found to be unsatisfactory in the following respects: (1) they required a speciﬁc reagent which was inﬂuenced by ascorbate (arnow,
1937), used in our assay to prevent dopa oxidation;
(2) they required radiolabeled substrates (reinhard
et al., 1986); and (3) they were laborious and timeconsuming (günendi et al., 1999). one of the recent
methods of choice used noncommercial porous graphitic carbon column, but no data on dopa concentrations measured and dopa detection limits achieved
(törnkvist et al., 2004) were published. hplc methods
with mass spectrophotometric detection were not suitable
because expensive equipment and a pre-puriﬁcation
step were required (li et al., 2000; letellier et al., 1997).
hplc methods with ﬂuorescence detection met our
requirements the best. two of them were tested and
the results are described.
an improved tyr hydroxylating activity assay using
isocratic hplc with ﬂuorescence detection was developed, and method was optimized with respect to substrate and product stability in reaction mixture, and
ﬁnally characterized by assessing the selectivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, calibration, lloq and stability in accordance with generally accepted standards
(shah et al., 2000; cder/cber, 2001).
the presented modiﬁed method needs neither sample
pre-puriﬁcation nor analyte derivatization, and does not
use reagents that interfere with ascorbate or equipment.
it is not time-consuming and enables a simultaneous,
rapid, sensitive and reproducible assay of tyr and
dopa in reaction mixtures containing either puriﬁed or
crude enzyme preparations.

experimental
reagents and chemicals
solvents used in hplc were of hplc grade. acetonitrile
(acn) was purchased from j.t. baker (deventer, holland)
and  xxxd2154xxx  from merck (darmstadt, germany). tris
buffer was purchased from serva (heidelberg, germany). all
other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained
from sigma (steinheim, germany).

stock solutions
stock solutions of dopa and tyr standards were prepared in
0.1%  xxxd2154xxx  at concentrations of 75 µm and 1.5 mm,
respectively. in comparative tests standards were dissolved in
0.15% phosphoric acid.

spiked matrix preparation
tyr spiked matrix. tyr at a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5 mm
was mixed with buffer a (120 mm tris–cl, 50 mm ascorbate,
ph 8.0) and sonicated for 45 min. catalase was then added to
a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and o2-gas was introduced

for 10 min. twenty-ﬁve microliters of the solution were preincubated in eppendorf tubes for 5 min at 25°c, 25 µl of the
buffer b (80 mm tris–cl, 277 mm nacl, 25% v/v glycerol, ph
8.0) was added and the tubes were incubated for an additional 10 min. after addition of 25 µl of 50% h3po4 the
tubes were centrifuged (14,000g, 10 min, room temperature,
rt) and the supernatants were stored at −25°c until hplc
analysis.
dopa-spiked matrix. buffer a was mixed with dopa to a
ﬁnal concentration of 75 µm, sonicated for 45 min and catalase
(0.1 mg/ml) was added. twenty-ﬁve microliters of the solution were preincubated in eppendorf tubes for 5 min at 25°c,
25 µl of the buffer b were added and the tubes were incubated for an additional 10 min. after addition of 25 µl of
50% h3po4 the tubes were centrifuged (14,000g, 10 min,
rt) and the supernatants were stored at −25°c until hplc
analysis.
sample preparation for matrix composition study. tyrspiked matrices were prepared as above except that for ph 4–
7.2 potassium phosphate and for ph 9–10 glycine–oh buffers
were used. in controls, either tyr or ascorbate was omitted.
reaction mixture preparation. buffer a was mixed with tyr
to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.5 mm and sonicated for 45 min.
catalase (0.1 mg/ml) was then added and o2-gas was introduced for 10 min. twenty-ﬁve microliters of the solution were
preincubated in eppendorf tubes for 5 min at 25°c. the
enzyme reaction was started by the addition of 25 µl crude
cell extract from e. coli bl21 (de3) overproducing lmbb2
or puriﬁed lmbb2 in buffer b (novotná et al., 2005). the
reaction was stopped after 10 min by addition of 25 µl of
50% h3po4 and centrifuged (14,000g, 10 min, rt). the
supernatants were stored at −25°c until the assay. the same
reaction mixture containing buffer solution instead of crude
cell extract was use as a control sample.
chromatographic system and analytical conditions. hplc
analyses were performed with a waters system (waters,
czech republic, prague) equipped with ﬂow controller
600 and autosampler 717, and millennium 32 software
was used for data processing. samples (40 µl) were loaded
onto an analytical luna c18 (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.; particle
size, 5 µm; phenomenex) column, connected to a security
guard c18 cartridge (30 × 20 mm i.d.; particle size, 5 µm;
phenomenex).
the mobile phase consisted of acn–0.08%  xxxd2154xxx 
(2.4/97.6, v/v), ﬂow rate, 1.0 ml/min. a washing step with
mobile phase consisting of 80% acn (10 min) was included
when crude enzyme preparations were analyzed to avoid
back pressure increase.
column efﬂuent was detected with a scanning ﬂuorescence
detector 474 (lambdaex 281 nm, lambdaem 314 nm, waters) with a gain
switch from 10 (dopa) to 1 (tyr) at 5 min of analysis to avoid
detector response overload.

method validation
selectivity. sample matrix (three replicates) containing neither
tyr nor dopa was used to evaluate the method selectivity.

calibration curve. calibration curves over linear ranges
from 0.125 to 25 µm and from 15.625 to 500 mm for dopa and
tyr, respectively were determined. stock solutions of standards were diluted to required concentrations with 0.08%  xxxd2154xxx . three sets of calibration standards were prepared
and each sample was measured in duplicate. each point of
calibration curve represents arithmetic means of six values.
lower limit of quantification. lloq was determined as
the lowest concentrations of dopa and tyr quantiﬁed with
precision (rsd) and accuracy lower then 20%. six replicates
of samples spiked with dopa (0.125 µm) and tyr (15.625 mm;
concentrations at which the signal-to-noise ratio was found to
be larger than 10) were measured.
accuracy and precision. to evaluated the precision and
accuracy of the assay, quality control samples were prepared
at concentrations of 0.125, 2.5 and 25 µm and 15.625, 125 and
500 mm for dopa and tyr, respectively. for intra-day precision and accuracy six replicates of quality control samples at
each concentration were assayed on the same day. the interday precision and accuracy were evaluated on six different
days. relative standard deviation (rsd) was taken as a
measure of precision, and the percentage difference between
determined and spiked amounts was considered a measure of
accuracy.
recovery. the recoveries from reaction mixture were determined at three different concentration levels, 0.125, 2.5 and
25 µm and 15.625, 125 and 500 mm for dopa and tyr, respectively. the recoveries were calculated by comparing the peak
areas for the analytes in the reaction mixtures and their
standard solutions in 0.08%  xxxd2154xxx  (six replicates for
each concentration).
stability. the stability of dopa and tyr in reaction mixture
was investigated for samples stored at rt and at −20°c (conditions usually encountered during actual sample handling
and analysis). samples at concentrations of 0.125, 25 µm and
15.625, 500 mm for dopa and tyr, respectively, were prepared. one part of prepared aliquots was stored at −20°c and
analyzed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days. the second part
was stored at rt and analyzed after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and
24 h. all samples were measured in triplicate (table 3).

results and discussion
method development
the main analytical problem in tracing the enzymatic
tyr hydroxylating reaction as well as in measuring
enzyme kinetics is the quantitative determination of
dopa, usually produced in very small amounts, in the
presence of tyr excess. for this purpose, hplc has
recently been used in plasma samples (letellier et al.,
1997) and enzymatic reaction mixtures (steiner et al.,
1996). in order to study tyr hydroxylating activity
operating in the lincomycin biosynthesis we evaluated
several hplc methods to ﬁnd a method applicable for

routine assays and dopa micro preparation. the criteria included sensitivity, resolution, run time, price,
equipment requirement and simplicity.
the ﬁrst method evaluated (steiner et al., 1996) employing a nucleosil c18 column and acn–1.5% h3po4
(1.6/98.4 v/v) as solvent system was modiﬁed to maintain the mobile phase ph within the range recommended by the column supplier. lowering the h3po4
concentration to 0.15% ended in results slightly different from those previously described (steiner et al.,
1996): the resolution between dopa and tyr was under
1.5 and the peaks tailed [fig. 1(a)]. decreasing acn
concentration (1 or 0%) led to imperceptible changes
in resolution, while peaks tailing further deteriorated.
the same mobile phase combined with separon c18
column (tessek, prague, czech republic) yielded
better resolution. however, the peaks of the analytes in
question tailed again (data not shown). decreased
quantiﬁcation accuracy disabled micro preparation of
puriﬁed dopa for subsequent ms analysis.
the second method evaluated (zegota et al.,
2005) with mobile phase consisting of 0.08% formic
acid, developed for separation of dopa and tyr isomers arising in gamma -irradiated solution, offered a good
separation of dopa from tyr. however, the observed
dopa peak tailing does not enable its quantiﬁcation at
low concentrations. therefore, the effect of organic
modiﬁer content (acn, 0–4.8%) at a constant formic
acid concentration (0.08%) was tested (table 1). as
compared with the elution proﬁles of studied analytes
found with mobile phase consisting of  xxxd2154xxx  only,
the addition of the acn resulted in shorter retention
times and peak focusing (table 1). the mobile phase
acn concentration (2.4%) was found to be a good
compromise between acceptable run time, good separation, resolution and peak shape [fig. 1(b)]. in addition,
the low peak tailing enabled micro preparation for
subsequent high-resolution ms identiﬁcation of dopa
formed in the reaction. acn concentration higher
than 4.8% resulted in a changed elution peak order and
interference of some reaction components with tyr was
observed.
the analytical protocol described was also used for a
direct analysis of crude enzyme preparations without
previous sample puriﬁcation. as compared with analysis of standards and/or puriﬁed enzyme preparations,
an increased column back pressure was observed
(fig. 2) after several analytical runs. therefore, a
10 min step-wash procedure with 80% aqueous acn
was inserted after each analysis, which resulted in
stabilization of back pressure.

dopa and tyr in tyr hydroxylase reaction mixture.
under chromatographic conditions described in this
study dopa and tyr were well separated (retention
time of 4.4 and 5.6 min for dopa and tyr, respectively),
despite the three-order concentration difference. no
interfering components of sample matrix were detected
by ﬂuorescence detection under chromatographic parameters used (fig. 3).

tyr ranged from 95.3 to 98.1% with the precision from
0.6 to 1.5%. the inter-day accuracy ranged from 95.1 to
101.5% with precision from 0.9 to 5.2%. these results
indicate that the presented method has satisfactory
accuracy, precision and reproducibility.
recovery. the recovery levels were greater than
100.66 ± 0.89% and greater than 94.76 ± 0.94% for
dopa and tyr, respectively, at all the concentrations
studied (table 3). the decrease in tyr concentration
was probably caused by tyr oxidation into dopa and
related substances during reaction matrix preparation
and processing.
stability
the stabilities of dopa and tyr during the sample storage and processing procedure were evaluated. no signiﬁcant degradations were found and results are given
in table 3. concentrations of the analytes in question
were slightly increased after 14 days of storage at
−20°c caused probably by sample freeze drying.
composition of the enzyme reaction mixture and
sample stability
other serious difﬁculties with the tyr hydroxylating
activity assay, aside from the dopa/tyr concentration
ratio, are generally low reaction rates of the tyr hydroxylating enzymes together with non-enzymatic forma-

1257

tion of tyr and dopa oxidative products (foster, 1950),
which are further deteriorated by the necessity to introduce oxygen as the enzyme substrate to the reaction
mixture. owing to active oxygen forms arising from
its reactions with traces of iron, dopa is oxidized to
dopaquinone. this unstable compound undergoes other
reactions and ﬁnally polymerizes spontaneously giving
rise to melanin pigments (hearing and jiménez, 1987).
the oxidation of tyr is slower than the oxidation of
dopa.
to eliminate active oxygen species enzymatic hydroxylations in the presence of catalase are generally
carried out (steiner et al., 1996) and catalase (1 mg/ml)
was therefore also used in this study. a continuous
reduction of dopaquinone and other oxidation products
back to dopa is routinely performed by addition of
ascorbate to the assays. effective conversion of nonenzymatic oxidation products back to dopa is achieved
at a concentration of 25 mm (marumo and waite, 1986).
however, ascorbate, under certain conditions functions
as a prooxidant. therefore, the effect of ph of the
reaction mixture on the non-enzymatic formation of
dopa in the presence of ascorbate was evaluated.
we found that the non-enzymatic dopa formation is
negligible or very low at ph 8 when ascorbate functions
as an antioxidant (table 4). fortunately, the ph optimum of lmbb2 was determined to be 8 (novotná
et al., 2005).
ascorbate was also shown to exhibit an inhibitory
effect on the catalytic activity of tyr hydroxylating

original research

enzymes in some cases (golan-goldhirsh and whitaker,
1984) and, therefore, its effect on the lmbb2 activity
was examined and it was found that ascorbate at 25 mm
increased the examined enzyme activity approximately
three times (novotná et al., 2005).

conclusion
an assay for tyr hydroxylating activity operating in
lincomycin biosynthetic pathway is described. the
improved hplc procedure developed in this study
enables not only separation and determination of dopa
but also, contrary to previously published methods,
dopa micro preparation in reaction mixtures containing
high excess of tyr. this is particularly important when
assigning the activity to proteins of unknown function.
the optional washing step introduced to the procedure
enables analysis of crude enzyme preparations without
decreasing the column lifetime. in addition, the hplc
method was validated for its selectivity, accuracy, precision and sample stability. since natural dopa and
tyr ﬂuorescence was used for detection, no further
derivatization, use of radioactive isotopes and/or expensive or arduous service demanding equipment were
required, which qualify the described procedure for
routine analysis of tyr hydroxylating activity.
contribution of reaction mixture components to the
background formation, which is a serious common problem with performance of the tyr hydroxylating reaction, was evaluated. samples of the reaction mixture
were stable for at least 24 h at rt and for 28 days at
−20°c prior to hplc analysis.
