1  xxxd147xxx  is a clinically available drug that suppresses steroid biosynthesis by inhibiting
enzymes such as cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and aromatase. because several members of neurosteroids
regulate glutamate receptors, we investigated the effect of  xxxd147xxx  on cell death induced by
overactivation of glutamate receptors in cns neurons.
2 long-term pretreatment of organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures with  xxxd147xxx 
(100–1000 mm) for 6 days or over resulted in concentration-dependent suppression of neuronal cell
death induced by nmda.  xxxd147xxx  (1000 mm) also inhibited neurotoxicity of ampa and
kainate, but not of  xxxd2379xxx  or  xxxd3241xxx .
3 the protective effect of  xxxd147xxx  against nmda cytotoxicity was not mimicked by
other steroid synthesis inhibitors including  xxxd3436xxx  and exemestane, and was not reversed by
concurrent application of steroids such as pregnenolone, estrone, 17b-estradiol and estriol.
4 in dissociated rat cerebrocortical cell cultures, long-term treatment with  xxxd147xxx  (10–
1000 mm) attenuated nmda receptor-mediated glutamate cytotoxicity but produced no significant
effect on glutamate-induced increases in intracellular ca2 þ .
5 brief as well as long-term pretreatment with  xxxd147xxx  (30–1000 mm) prevented nmda
receptor-dependent ischemic neuronal injury in organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures, which was
associated with suppression of glutamate release during the ischemic insult.
6 these results indicate that  xxxd147xxx , irrelevant to its actions on neurosteroid synthesis,
protects cns neurons from excitotoxic and ischemic injuries. development of  xxxd147xxx 
analogs possessing neuroprotective properties may be of therapeutic value.

introduction
the term ‘excitotoxicity’ corresponds to damage of cells
induced by aberrant activation of receptors for glutamate,
the major excitatory neurotransmitter in cns. overactivation
of glutamate receptors typically results from excessive release
of glutamate from synaptic terminals and/or glial cells, as
observed in seizure-induced neuronal damage and ischemic
neuronal injury (nishizawa, 2001; holmes, 2002). reduced
capacity for glutamate uptake from the extracellular fluid
represents another mechanism of  xxxg981xxx  overactivation, as suggested in pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (maragakis & rothstein, 2004). in addition, neuronal
damage by glutamate synergistically with other insults has
been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including
alzheimer’s, parkinson’s and huntington’s disease (meldrum
& garthwaite 1990; mattson, 2003). in these ways, excitotoxicity plays a fundamental role in various pathological
conditions in the brain.
both neurons and glia can synthesize steroidal compounds
called neurosteroids (zwain & yen, 1999), which exert various

influences on brain function (mellon & griffin, 2002; reddy,
2003). neurosteroids modulate activities of neurotransmitter
receptors including ionotropic glutamate receptors (wu et al.,
1991; irwin et al., 1994; weaver et al., 2000), and several
members of neurosteroids are shown either to suppress or to
exacerbate excitotoxic neuronal injury. for example, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfated derivative protect hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic insults by nmda, ampa
or kainate (kimonides et al., 1998; kurata et al., 2004).
pregnanolone sulfate, a metabolite of progesterone, inhibits
nmda-induced membrane current and intracellular ca2 þ
increase, and is neuroprotective against nmda cytotoxicity
(park-chung et al., 1997; weaver et al., 1997; shirakawa et al.,
2002). moreover, veiga et al. (2003) have demonstrated that
pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone, through aromatase-mediated conversion to estradiol, protect hippocampal
hilar neurons against kainic acid cytotoxicity. in contrast,
 xxxd544xxx  positively modulates nmda receptor
channels and exacerbates nmda-induced neuronal death
(weaver et al., 1998; yaghoubi et al., 1998; shirakawa et al.,
2002).

these observations underscore the importance of neurosteroids in regulation of excitotoxicity-mediated neuronal damage.
however, the overall influence of biosynthesis of endogenous
neurosteroids on excitotoxic injury remains unclear, because
some neurosteroids are protective but others are deleterious to
neuronal cells. accordingly, we set out to examine the effect of
 xxxd147xxx  (figure 1a) on excitotoxicity-related neuronal injury.  xxxd147xxx  inhibits cytochrome  xxxg570xxx 

neuroprotective actions of  xxxd147xxx 

with an apparent ki value of 14 mm (foster et al., 1983):
cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step
of neurosteroid synthesis, namely, production of pregnenolone
from cholesterol (salhanick, 1982).  xxxd147xxx  also
inhibits aromatase, an enzyme involved in production of
estrogens, with an apparent ki value of 0.6 mm (salhanick,
1982; foster et al., 1983). on the basis of these actions, clinical
use of  xxxd147xxx  is approved in the united states for
the treatment of hormone-dependent malignant tumors (miller
et al., 1987; alshowaier et al., 1999). here we report
unexpected findings that  xxxd147xxx  protects cortical
neurons from excitotoxic and ischemic injuries, probably
through the mechanisms unrelated to steroid biosynthesis.

all experimental procedures were approved by our institutional animal experimentation committee, and animals were
treated in accordance with the guidelines of the u.s. national
institutes of health regarding the care and use of animals for
experimental procedures. organotypic slice cultures were
prepared with the procedures described previously (shirakawa
et al., 2002; 2005). briefly, we anesthetized postnatal day 2 or 3
wistar rats (from 35 mother rats in total) by chilling them in
ice for 2–3 min, decapitated them, and removed the brain from
the skull and cut it into two hemispheres. each hemisphere was
cut into coronal slices of 300 mm thickness with a tissue
chopper (narishige, tokyo, japan), and six cerebrocortical
slices (seven slices in some cases) at the rostro-caudal level
containing the caudate putamen were transferred onto a
millicell-cm insert membrane (30 mm in diameter; millipore,
bedford, ma, u.s.a.) in six-well plates. culture medium,
consisting of 50% minimal essential medium/hepes (gibco, invitrogen japan, tokyo, japan), 25% hanks’ balanced
salt solution (gibco) and 25% heat-inactivated horse serum
(gibco) supplemented with 6.5 mg ml1 glucose and 2 mm
glutamine, 100 u ml1  xxxd2871xxx  potassium and 100 mg ml1
streptomycin sulfate (gibco), was supplied at 0.7 ml well1.
culture medium was replaced with fresh medium on the next
day of culture preparation, and thereafter, every 2 days. slices
were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95%
air at 341c. from 10 days in vitro (div; 6 div in several
experiments), cultures were maintained in serum-free medium
consisting of 75% minimal essential medium/hepes and 25%

cell death assay in slice cultures

quantification of glutamate released from slice cultures

slice cultures were treated with excitotoxins,  xxxd2379xxx  and
 xxxd3241xxx  for 24 h at 11 div with serum-free medium
whose composition is described above. chemical ischemia was
applied to cultures at 11 div by transfer of culture inserts to
the plates containing the conditioning solution. the conditioning solution was glucose-free ringer’s buffer (124 mm nacl,
4.9 mm kcl, 1.3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2 mm cacl2, 1.2 mm kh2po4
and 25.6 mm nahco3, ph 7.4) supplemented with 3 mm
sodium azide and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose (katsuki et al.,
2005). after ischemic treatment for 30–60 min, culture inserts
were transferred to the plates containing serum-free culture
medium and maintained for further 24 h.
cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4%
sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer overnight, rinsed with
distilled water twice and exposed to 0.1% toluidine blue
solution for 15 min. after rinse in distilled water, specimens
were dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol and mounted
with entellan neu (merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany).
positively stained cells possessing round or oval cell bodies and
clear nuclear boundaries were judged as viable neurons. the
maximal number of surviving neurons in an area of 80  90 mm2
within the parietal cortex of individual slices was counted.
we also measured pi uptake into slices and lactate
dehydrogenase (ldh) efflux to the culture medium. pi
(5 mg ml1) was added to serum-free medium from 24 h before
and during treatment with excitotoxins,  xxxd2379xxx  and
 xxxd3241xxx . in the case of ischemia, pi (5 mg ml1) was
applied to slice cultures from 24 h before chemical ischemia,
and also during 24 h of post-incubation. slices were observed
with an inverted fluorescence microscope with a rhodamine
filter set. fluorescence images were captured through a
monochrome chilled ccd camera (c5985, hamamatsu
photonics, hamamatsu, japan), and stored images were
analyzed with nih image 1.62 software. the average signal
intensity in an area of 180  180 mm2 within the parietal cortex
was obtained as the fluorescence value of each slice. to reduce
variability among different sets of experiments, we normalized
the fluorescent value with reference to that obtained with the
‘standard injury’. the standard injury for slice cultures was
induced by 24 h treatment with 200 mm nmda, which nearly,
but not exactly, equaled ‘complete injury’. in each set of
experiments, one culture well received the standard injury, and
the mean fluorescence value obtained from slices in this culture
well was set to 100%. values obtained from slices in other
wells that received various treatments were expressed as
percentage of the standard injury. we occasionally encountered slices exhibiting deteriorated appearance or robust pi
fluorescence before application of insults. these slices were
excluded from cell death analysis.
ldh activity in culture medium was measured with
cytotoxicity detection ldh kit (kyokuto pharmaceutical
industrial, tokyo, japan). culture medium (25 ml) was mixed
with 25 ml of ldh substrate mixture and 50 ml of 10 mm
phosphate-buffered saline in a 96-well plate. after incubation
for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by
addition of 100 ml of 1 m hcl and the absorbance was
measured at 570 nm. each value of absorbance was normalized

amounts of glutamate released during chemical ischemia were
measured with amplex red  xxxd2431xxx /glutamate oxidase
assay kit (molecular probes, eugene, or, u.s.a.) as described
(fujimoto et al., 2004). after ischemic treatment, 50 ml of the
ischemic conditioning solution in each well was collected and
mixed with 50 ml of a reaction buffer containing amplex red,
glutamate oxidase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alanine
and horseradish peroxidase. after incubation at 371c,
fluorescence of the reaction mixture emitted at 590 nm was
measured with a fluorescence microplate reader (flexstation;
molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, u.s.a.) at an excitation
wavelength of 555 nm.

dissociated cortical culture and cell death assay
primary cultures of dissociated cortical neurons were prepared
from the cerebral cortex of fetal wistar rats (17–19 days of
gestation) derived from 16 mother rats in total, as described
previously (shirakawa et al., 2002). single cells mechanically
dissociated from the whole cerebral cortex were seeded onto 48well plates coated with polyethylenimine (for cell death assay)
or onto glass coverslips coated with polyethylenimine (for ca2 þ
measurement) at a density of 4.5  105 cells cm2. cells were
maintained at 371c in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere in
eagle’s minimal essential medium (nissui pharmaceuticals,
tokyo, japan) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), glucose
(11 mm in total), nahco3 (24 mm), hepes (10 mm), and 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (1–7 div; jrh biosciences, lenexa, ks, u.s.a.) or 10% heat-inactivated horse
serum (8–12 div; jrh biosciences). proliferation of nonneuronal cells was arrested by addition of 10 mm cytosine
arabinoside at 6 div (sigma-aldrich chemicals).
at 11 div, glutamate was added to the medium for 24 h at
a final concentration of 300 mm, and cell death was evaluated
by ldh release assay as mentioned above for slice culture
experiments, except that 15 ml of culture medium was mixed with
30 ml of the ldh substrate mixture and 60 ml of 10 mm phosphatebuffered saline. cultures treated with 10 mm glutamate for 24 h
were used to determine the degree of the standard injury in each
set of experiments. absorbance values were normalized with the
absorbance in cultures that received standard injury as 100%.
we also evaluated cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. cultured cells were incubated in eagle’s medium containing
0.5 mg ml1 mtt for 2 h and then solubilized with isopropanol, and the absorbance at 595 nm was measured. viability was
expressed as % of control, by setting the value of control
cultures as 100% and the value of cultures receiving the
standard injury (10 mm glutamate for 24 h) as 0%.

measurement of intracellular ca2 þ concentration
glutamate-induced increases in intracellular ca2 þ concentration ([ca2 þ ]i) were estimated with a ca2 þ -sensitive fluorescent
dye, fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (dojindo, kumamoto,
japan), and a fluorescence imaging system (argus-hisca,
hamamatsu photonics, shizuoka, japan). dissociated cortical

neurons at 11–12 div cultured on a polyethylenimine-coated
glass coverslip were incubated in krebs–ringer buffer (137 mm
nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1.5 mm cacl2, 10 mm hepes,
25 mm glucose, ph 7.4) containing 5 mm fura-2 acetoxymethyl
ester and 0.01% cremophore el (sigma-aldrich chemicals)
for 30 min at 371c. after postincubation in fura-2-free krebs–
ringer buffer for at least 30 min, the coverslip was transferred
to a recording chamber settled on the stage of an inverted
fluorescence microscope. fura-2 fluorescence obtained by
excitation at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm was recorded
every 3 s at room temperature.

data presentation and statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean7s.e.m. statistical significance of
difference was evaluated with one-way anova followed by
student–newman–keuls’ test or dunnett’s test. concerning
values of glutamate release, two-tail paired t-test was used for
evaluation of difference between the group that received
ischemia alone and the group that received ischemia plus drug.
probability values less than 5% were considered significant.
values presented in a table and figures concerning nissl
staining (figures 1b, 2a and 3c) and pi uptake (table 1,
figures 1c, e, f, 2b, 3a, b, d, 5a and b) in slice cultures as well as
ldh release (figure 4a) and mtt reduction (figure 4b) in
dissociated cultures are from a representative set of experiments. reproducibility of the results was confirmed in at least
two (typically three to four) independent sets of experiments.
values of ldh release in slice cultures (figure 1d), glutamateinduced [ca2 þ ]i changes in dissociated cultures (figure 4d) and
glutamate release in slice cultures (table 1, figure 5c and d)
are combined ones obtained from multiple sets of experiments.

1000 mm, did not cause any changes in the number of nisslstained viable cortical neurons, indicating that the drug itself
was devoid of cytotoxic activity. nmda (20 mm) applied to
control cultures at 11 div for 24 h caused a marked decrease
in the number of surviving neurons, as assessed by nissl
staining. this decrease in cell viability was accompanied by
robust increases in pi fluorescence of slices and in the amount
of ldh released into the culture medium. as shown in
figure 1b, continuous treatment with  xxxd147xxx  from
1 div prevented nmda cytotoxicity in a concentrationdependent manner. judged from the number of nissl-stained
cells, significant neuroprotection was obtained with  xxxd147xxx  at concentrations of 300 mm and higher. the
protective effect was confirmed by measurement of pi
fluorescence (figure 1c) and ldh release (figure 1d).
we next examined whether  xxxd147xxx  could afford
neuroprotection against insults other than nmda. long-term

staining (data not shown) and pi uptake (figure 1e).
neuroprotective effect of 1000 mm  xxxd147xxx  was also
observed against cytotoxicity of 40 mm kainate, another nonnmda receptor agonist (data not shown). on the other hand,
neuronal injury induced by 24 h application of a ca2 þ
ionophore  xxxd2379xxx  (6 mm) was not affected by  xxxd147xxx  (figure 1f). long-term treatment with  xxxd147xxx  was also without effect against cell death induced by
24 h application of 6 mm  xxxd3241xxx  (data not shown).
to verify whether or not a prolonged treatment was
required for neuroprotection, we varied the periods of
application of  xxxd147xxx  (figure 2). treatment with
1000 mm  xxxd147xxx  for 6 days from 6 div suppressed
neuronal injury induced by treatment with 20 mm nmda at
11 div. the degree of protection was comparable to that
obtained by continuous treatment with 1000 mm  xxxd147xxx  from 1 div. in contrast, treatment with  xxxd147xxx  during the first half of the cultivation period, that
is, from 1 to 6 div, did not provide a significant effect.

suppressed nmda cytotoxicity. the results were confirmed
by counting of nissl-stained surviving cells (figure 2a) and
measurement of pi fluorescence (figure 2b).

neuroprotective effect of  xxxd147xxx  is unrelated
to inhibition of steroid synthesis
to evaluate whether the neuroprotective effect of  xxxd147xxx  is mediated by its effect on neurosteroid biosynthesis, we performed additional pharmacological examinations.
first, two drugs that inhibit steroidogenic pathways were
tested for their potential neuroprotective effects.  xxxd3436xxx 
competitively inhibits 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,
an enzyme involved in the conversion of pregnenolone,
17-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone into
progesterone, 17- xxxd2303xxx  and d4-androsten3, xxxd2153xxx , respectively (robel et al., 1995). the ic50 value
of  xxxd3436xxx  on the enzyme activity has been reported to be
4.06 mm, when 1 mm pregnenolone is used as a substrate
(coirini et al., 2003). exemestane is a selective inhibitor of
aromatase with a ki value of 4.3 nm (di salle et al., 1994;
miller et al., 2003), therefore mimics part of the properties
of  xxxd147xxx  as an enzyme inhibitor.  xxxd3436xxx 
(3–30 mm) and exemestane (1–10 mm) were applied to cortical
slice cultures continuously from 1 div, and nmda cytotoxicity was examined at 11 div in the presence of these drugs.
neither of these drugs produced a significant effect on cell
death induced by 20 mm nmda, as assessed by nissl staining
(data not shown) and pi fluorescence (figure 3a and b). we
could not test the effect of these drugs at higher concentrations
because of their cytotoxicity.
second, we examined whether the neuroprotective effect
of  xxxd147xxx  against nmda cytotoxicity could be
reversed by application of neurosteroids.  xxxd147xxx 
was applied to slice cultures from 6 div, simultaneously with
10 mm of pregnenolone, estrone, 17b-estradiol or estriol. to
avoid any influences caused by steroidal compounds contained
in serum, serum-free medium was used throughout the period
of drug treatment. in these settings,  xxxd147xxx  again
prevented neuronal death induced by 24 h application of
20 mm nmda. however, neither of the steroids provided
a significant influence on the neuroprotective effect of
 xxxd147xxx , as assessed by nissl staining (figure 3c)
and pi fluorescence (figure 3d). these results do not support
the proposal that neuroprotection by  xxxd147xxx  is
mediated by depletion of neurosteroids from the cortical
tissue.
bastida et al. (2001) have reported that  xxxd147xxx 
may act as an inhibitor of  xxxg1836xxx . therefore, we
examined the effect of kt5720, a selective  xxxg1836xxx 
inhibitor. however, long-term treatment with 0.1–1 mm
kt5720 did not produce a significant effect on nmda
cytotoxicity (data not shown).

effects of  xxxd147xxx  on glutamate cytotoxicity
and glutamate-induced ca2 þ increase in dissociated
cortical neurons
a possible mechanism of neuroprotection by  xxxd147xxx  is that the drug may somehow inhibit ca2 þ influx
through  xxxg981xxx -associated channels, thereby prevent [ca2 þ ]i from reaching cytotoxic levels. accordingly, we

neuroprotective actions of  xxxd147xxx 

examined effect of  xxxd147xxx  on glutamate-induced
increases in [ca2 þ ]i in cortical neurons. for this purpose, we
used dissociated cortical neurons instead of cortical slice
cultures, because estimation of [ca2 þ ]i in slice culture
preparations was difficult. before the experiments on [ca2 þ ]i,
we did cytotoxicity experiments to confirm that  xxxd147xxx  was also neuroprotective in dissociated cortical cell
cultures. application of 300 mm glutamate for 24 h resulted in
neuronal death indicated by an increase in ldh release and a
decrease in activity of mtt reduction. glutamate cytotoxicity
under these conditions was abolished by 10 mm mk-801, an
nmda receptor antagonist (data not shown). continuous
treatment of cortical neurons with  xxxd147xxx  (10–
1000 mm) from 2 div to the end of the culture period resulted
in a concentration-dependent inhibition of glutamate neurotoxicity, as assessed by ldh release assay (figure 4a) and
mtt assay (figure 4b). the effect of  xxxd147xxx  was
not reversed by concurrent application of 1 mm pregnenolone
(data not shown), suggesting again that inhibition of
steroidogenesis was not responsible for neuroprotection.
dissociated cortical neurons that received long-term treatment with 10–1000 mm  xxxd147xxx  were subjected to
measurement of [ca2 þ ]i. in sham-treated neurons, glutamate
(300 mm) induced a robust [ca2 þ ]i increase that decayed
gradually during 9 min of observation period. neurons treated
continuously with  xxxd147xxx  also responded to
glutamate with an increase in [ca2 þ ]i (figure 4c). the peak
levels of [ca2 þ ]i increase (figure 4d) as well as the [ca2 þ ]i
levels at 9 min after the onset of glutamate application (data
not shown) did not significantly differ among different
treatment groups. therefore, inhibition of ca2 þ influx is
unlikely to mediate the neuroprotective effect of  xxxd147xxx .

 xxxd147xxx  inhibits glutamate release and
neuronal injury induced by ischemia in cortical slice
culture
finally, we examined effects of  xxxd147xxx  on ischemia-induced neuronal injury. simulated ischemia was achieved
by incubation of cortical slice cultures with glucose-free
ringer’s buffer containing sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose
(katsuki et al., 2005). this treatment resulted in extracellular
accumulation of glutamate during the treatment, and neuronal
damage at 24 h after the treatment (table 1). both consequences were increasingly apparent with longer periods of
chemical ischemia. in the following experiments, 45 min was
adopted as the period of ischemic treatment. application of
1 mm mk-801 during and after chemical ischemia almost
completely protected cortical neurons (data not shown).
figure 5a shows that continuous treatment of cortical slice
cultures with  xxxd147xxx  from 1 div suppressed
ischemic neuronal injury. the protective effect of  xxxd147xxx  was in a concentration-dependent manner, which
was significant at or over 30 mm and was almost complete at
1000 mm. importantly, we found that prolonged treatment was
not required for the protective effect. application of  xxxd147xxx  from 1 h before chemical ischemia also suppressed neuronal injury (figure 5b). the range of effective
concentrations of  xxxd147xxx  in this setting (at or over
30 mm) was the same as that in long-term treatment.

h. shirakawa et al

because glutamate cytotoxicity is central to ischemic
neuronal injury, we examined whether  xxxd147xxx 
produced any influences on extracellular glutamate accumulation during ischemic insult. we found that long-term treatment
of slice cultures with  xxxd147xxx  (30–1000 mm) from 1
div markedly inhibited ischemia-induced glutamate accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 5c). the
degree of inhibition of glutamate accumulation by various
concentrations of  xxxd147xxx  paralleled the degree of
neuroprotection. moreover, application of  xxxd147xxx 
from 1 h before chemical ischemia was as effective as long-term
treatment of the drug in suppressing glutamate accumulation
(figure 5d).

discussion
the initial purpose of the present study was to verify potential
roles of endogenous neurosteroids in regulation of excitotoxic neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex. we supposed
that  xxxd147xxx  would be a useful pharmacological
tool to address this issue, because the drug was expected
to inhibit biosynthesis of neurosteroids by inhibiting cytochrome  xxxg570xxx . we found that  xxxd147xxx  produced
potent neuroprotective effects in two paradigms of neuronal
injury. first, long-term treatment of cortical slice cultures
with  xxxd147xxx  attenuated nmda neurotoxicity.
the unexpected finding was that supplementation of various
steroids did not reverse the neuroprotective effect of
 xxxd147xxx . in particular, the ineffectiveness of pregnenolone, the immediate product of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx ,
indicates that the observed effect of  xxxd147xxx  is not
related to inhibition of neurosteroid biosynthesis. second,
 xxxd147xxx  prevented ischemic neuronal injury.
although we did not examine the consequences of steroid
supplementation in this paradigm, depletion of endogenous
neurosteroids is unlikely to mediate neuroprotection by
 xxxd147xxx , because the drug effectively blocked
ischemia-induced accumulation of extracellular glutamate
and neuronal injury with only 1 h of pretreatment.  xxxd147xxx  has been shown to attenuate excitotoxicity in the
retina, but in this case, the effect is mediated by reduction of
de novo biosynthesis of  xxxd544xxx  (guarneri et al.,
1998). steroidogenesis-independent neuroprotective actions of
 xxxd147xxx  are unprecedented findings of the present
study.
several days of treatment were required for the protective
actions of  xxxd147xxx  against nmda neurotoxicity.
in addition, long-term treatment with  xxxd147xxx 
prevented neuronal death induced by excitotoxins including
nmda, ampa and kainate, but had no effect against
other cytotoxic agents such as  xxxd2379xxx  and  xxxd3241xxx .
hence, a plausible mechanism of neuroprotection was that
 xxxd147xxx  might decrease the number, or suppress the
function, of ionotropic glutamate receptors, thereby attenuate
excess ca2 þ entry during excitotoxic insults. however, we did
not observe a significant effect of  xxxd147xxx  on
glutamate-induced increase in [ca2 þ ]i. the results indicate that neuroprotective actions of  xxxd147xxx  may
involve some cellular events downstream of  xxxg981xxx 
activation. screening of genes and proteins whose expression
levels are modified by long-term treatment with amino-

 xxxd2214xxx  may provide useful information concerning the
molecular targets mediating neuroprotection.
our results in the present study do not necessarily exclude
the roles of endogenous neurosteroids in regulation of
neuronal injury. substantial lines of evidence suggest that
neurosteroids influence excitotoxic consequences in cns
neurons. for example, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate
protect hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic insults (kimonides et al., 1998; kurata et al., 2004).  xxxd544xxx 
augments, whereas pregnanolone sulfate inhibits, nmda
receptor-mediated ca2 þ influx and resultant cytotoxicity
(weaver et al., 1998; shirakawa et al., 2002). because
 xxxd147xxx  is likely to prevent excitotoxic injury
through the mechanisms downstream of  xxxg981xxx 
activation, the effect of steroid depletion on neuronal death
may well be occluded or masked by steroid-independent
actions of  xxxd147xxx . alternative methods like
specific knockdown of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  expression may
be required to evaluate the net effects of depletion of
endogenous neurosteroids.
in contrast to the effect on nmda cytotoxicity, the
neuroprotective effect of  xxxd147xxx  against ischemic
neuronal injury was evident after a brief period of pretreatment. because the degree of protection paralleled the decrease
in the levels of glutamate accumulation during ischemic insult,
we suggest that inhibition of aberrant release of glutamate is
responsible for the effect of this drug against ischemic neuronal
injury. detailed mechanisms of inhibition of glutamate release
by  xxxd147xxx  remain an open question. various
routes including exocytosis, reversed glutamate transport and
efflux through volume-sensitive anion channels have been
implicated in glutamate release from neurons and glia during
ischemia (nedergaard et al., 2002). a nearly complete
blockade of extracellular glutamate accumulation by 1000 mm
 xxxd147xxx , in spite of the presence of multiple routes
of glutamate release, implies that the drug interferes with
cellular events upstream of glutamate release, rather than
individual release machineries.
in conclusion, we report here that  xxxd147xxx 
exerted novel neuroprotective actions against excitotoxic
and ischemic injuries. the mechanisms of actions do not
involve any known pharmacological properties of this drug
and should be addressed in further investigations.  xxxd147xxx  has been used for therapies of hormonedependent malignant tumors in the united states (miller
et al., 1987; alshowaier et al., 1999). daily dose of
 xxxd147xxx  is 250–1000 mg, and serum concentration
of this drug in patients receiving 1000 mg dosing has been
reported to be 9.0 mg ml1 (38.7 mm; miller et al., 1987). in
addition, unger et al. (1986) demonstrated accumulation
of [14c]- xxxd147xxx  in the brain after systemic
administration in rats. development of  xxxd147xxx 
analogs that retain neuroprotective properties but are devoid
of actions on steroidogenesis may be useful for therapies
against various neurodegenerative disorders.
