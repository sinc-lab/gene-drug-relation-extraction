abstract:  xxxg1296xxx  [e.c. 3.7.1.3] is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes
the hydrolytic cleavage of l-kynurenine to  xxxd189xxx  and l-alanine. sequence alignment with other
plp-dependent enzymes indicated that  xxxg1296xxx  is in subgroup iva of the aminotransferases, along
with  xxxg1562xxx , csdb, and serine-pyruvate aminotransferase, which suggests that  xxxg1296xxx  has an
aminotransferase fold. crystals of pseudomonas fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  were obtained, and the structure
was solved by molecular replacement using the csdb coordinates combined with multiple isomorphous
heavy atom replacement. the coordinates were deposited in the pdb (id code 1qz9). the structure,
refined to an r factor of 15.5% to 1.85 å resolution, is dimeric and has the aminotransferase fold. the
structure also confirms the prediction from sequence alignment that lys-227 is the plp-binding residue
in p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx . the conserved asp-201, expected for an aminotransferase fold, is located
near the plp nitrogen, but asp-132 is also strictly conserved and at a similar distance from the pyridinium
nitrogen. mutagenesis of both conserved aspartic acids shows that both contribute equally to plp binding,
but asp-201 has a greater role in catalysis. the structure shows that tyr-226 donates a hydrogen bond to
the phosphate of plp. unusual among plp-dependent enzymes, trp-256, which is also strictly conserved
in kynureninases from bacteria to humans, donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate through the indole
n1-hydrogen.

 xxxg1296xxx  [e.c. 3.7.1.3] is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate
(plp1)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic
cleavage of l-kynurenine to  xxxd189xxx  and l-alanine
(eq 1). this reaction is a key step in the catabolism of

l-tryptophan

by pseudomonas fluorescens and some other
bacteria (1). in fungi and vertebrates, kynurenine is first
hydroxylated to 3-hydroxykynurenine, which is the preferred
substrate of  xxxg1296xxx  in those organisms, resulting in
3-hydroxyanthranilate and l-alanine.
 xxxg1296xxx  also plays a role in the biosynthesis of nad(p)+. the product of  xxxg1296xxx , 3-hydroxyanthranilate,

is subsequently converted by 3-hydroxyanthranilate-3,4dioxygenase to quinolinic acid, which is a precursor of nad(p)+. however, quinolinic acid is also a neurotoxin, due to
its agonist effects on the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)
receptor (2). excessive levels of quinolinic acid have been
implicated in the etiology of a wide range of neurological
disorders, such as epilepsy, stroke, and aids-related dementia (3-10). thus, inhibitors of  xxxg1296xxx  are of
interest as potential drugs for the treatment of these cns
disorders.
the  xxxg1296xxx  from p. fluorescens, a dimer with a
subunit molecular weight of 45000, has been cloned and
expressed in escherichia coli (11). the p. fluorescens
 xxxg1296xxx  is highly homologous to the human enzyme,
with 28% identical residues (11). thus, the three-dimensional
structures must be similar. sequence alignment with other
plp-dependent enzymes shows that kynureninases are in
subgroup iva of the aminotransferases, along with  xxxg1562xxx ,
csdb, and serine-pyruvate aminotransferase, suggesting that
 xxxg1296xxx  has an aminotransferase fold (12). in the
present work, we obtained crystals of p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  suitable for x-ray diffraction and solved the structure
to 1.85 å. the structure confirms the prediction that
 xxxg1296xxx  has the aminotransferase fold. furthermore, the
structure shows several unusual features, including two
conserved aspartate residues in the plp-binding site, asp201 and asp-132, and a conserved tryptophan, trp-256,
which donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate of plp.
the implications of the structure for the mechanism of
 xxxg1296xxx  are discussed. furthermore, the structure of the
bacterial  xxxg1296xxx  will help in the structure determination

for the design and evaluation of novel, selective, and more
potent inhibitors.
materials and methods
cloning, expression, and purification. recombinant
 xxxg1296xxx  was purified initially from e.coli cells containing plasmid ptz18u with the gene coding for p. fluorescens
 xxxg1296xxx  (11). to prepare an expression construct
amenable for  xxxd3187xxx  substitution, ptz18u was
used to subclone the  xxxg1296xxx  gene into psapko-wt,
a modified pet28b vector (novagen) containing sapi sites
introduced between the ecori and ncoi sites of the original
vector (13). this construct, plb1kyn, was transformed into
the methionine auxotroph e. coli b834 (de3).
alternative purification schemes were developed after
difficulties were encountered in producing crystals using the
original protocol (11). e. coli cells containing ptz18u or
plb1kyn were grown for 15-17 h at 37 °c in 50 ml
inoculums of lb medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract,
0.5%  xxxd3213xxx ; the ph was adjusted to 7.0 with
sodium hydroxide) containing 100 µg/ml carbenicillin. after
inoculation into 1 l of the same medium, cells were grown
for 4-5 h before induction by 1 mm iptg. the cells were
collected by centrifugation at 4 °c for 15 min at 10000g
and suspended in 30 ml of buffer (5 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 8.0, containing 0.2 mm plp). a 1 mm
concentration of pmsf (1 m stock in  xxxd2400xxx ) was added
to the cell suspension. after sonication on ice for 3 min in
1 min increments with a fisher scientific 550 sonic dismembrator, cell debris was removed by centrifugation for
30 min at 25000g at 4 °c. a solution of 2% (w/v) protamine
sulfate (4 ml) was added dropwise to the supernatant, and
the precipitant was separated by centrifugation at 4 °c for
20 min at 55000g. the subsequent purification steps were
carried out by two procedures, either of which were able to
produce homogeneous enzyme that crystallized.

purification scheme 1 continued by loading the enzyme
onto a hitrap q (amersham-pharmacia, 5 ml) column
equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0,
at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, washing with the same buffer,
and then eluting using a 0-0.5 m nacl (same buffer)
gradient over 20 column volumes. the active fractions were
combined, and the solution was replaced by 5 mm potassium
phosphate and 0.2 mm plp buffer by repeated (two times)
concentration (5 ml) and dilution (50 ml) with 5 mm
potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.2 mm plp using
a ym 30 ultrafiltration membrane (amicon). the enzyme
was applied to an omega-aminohexylagarose (sigma) column
equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0,
washed with the same buffer, and eluted using a 0-0.5 m
nacl gradient over 20 column volumes. after a buffer
change to 5 mm potassium phosphate containing 0.2 mm
plp by ultrafiltration as before, the sample was applied to
a second hitrap q column equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0. the enzyme was washed with
the same buffer and then eluted using a 0-0.5 m nacl
gradient. the buffer was changed to 0.5 m potassium
phosphate containing 0.2 mm plp by ultrafiltration. the
resulting solution was then applied to a phenyl-sepharose
(amersham-pharmacia) column equilibrated with 0.5 m
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0. the enzyme was washed
with the same buffer and then eluted using a 0.5 m to 5
mm potassium phosphate buffer gradient.
the second purification scheme proved to be difficult to
reproduce and involved concentration of the crude extract
(30 ml) to 3 ml on a ym 30 ultrafiltration membrane
(amicon) and subsequent dilution to 15 ml with water
containing 0.2 mm plp. the diluted protein was applied to
a hydroxyapatite column (biorad, 3.0 cm × 15 cm)
equilibrated with 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0,
washed with the same buffer, and then eluted with 5 mm
potassium phosphate, ph 8.0. the active fractions from either

of the above methods, containing specific activities of greater
than 15, were combined and concentrated on an amicon
membrane to the final concentration of the protein equal to
40 mg/ml. the purified protein exhibited a single band on
silver-stained sds-page on phastgel homogeneous 20
(amersham-pharmacia). purified protein was usually divided
into 100 µl portions and stored at -78 °c. the protein
concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance
at 280 nm on a pharmacia biotech ultrospec 2000 spectrophotometer using the extinction coefficient e1%1cm ) 14.0
(14). the activity of  xxxg1296xxx  was determined by
following the decrease in absorbance at 360 nm (∆ )
-4500 m-1 cm-1) as kynurenine is hydrolyzed to anthranilic
acid.
crystallization, structure determination, and refinement.
crystallization experiments were performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature (15,
16) using sparse matrix approaches (17). heavy atom
derivatives of thiomersalyl (c9h9hgna2o2s) and potassium
tetrachloroplatinate(ii) were obtained by soaking native
protein crystals in solutions of heavy atom compounds in
the stabilizing solution, 40% (w/v) peg 400, 0.2 m licl,
0.2 mm plp, 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph 8.0, at
concentrations of 2.5-4.0 mm for 1-3 days. a xe heavy
atom derivative was obtained by suspending the crystals in
a xe atmosphere for 10 min at a 700 kpa pressure using a
molecular structure corp. cryo-xe-siter. a nabr derivative
was obtained by briefly (10-15 s) transferring the native
crystals through stabilizing solution containing 1 m nabr
(18). x-ray diffraction data from a single crystal of native
protein to 1.85 å resolution and the five heavy atom
derivatives were collected in-house using a mar research
imaging plate scanner mounted on a rigaku ru-200 generator (cu kr, lambda ) 1.5418 å). all data were collected at -180
°c except the thiomersalyl derivative, which was collected
at room temperature. the data were processed and merged
using the programs denzo and scalepack (19, 20). the
statistics for data collection and processing are summarized
in table 1.
phases for the protein structure factors at 2.6 å resolution
were derived by a combination of mir and mr methods.
initial heavy atom positions were obtained from the program
solve (21) using the xe derivative. a second heavy atom,
on a special position, was found using harker sections of
the anomalous difference patterson map. a molecular
replacement solution was found using the cr model of csdb
from e. coli (pdb code 1c0n) (22, 23). the level of
sequence identity between  xxxg1296xxx  and csdb is 16%.
a cross-rotation function with an integration radius of 30 å
and a translation function were calculated in the resolution

range from 10 to 6.5 å using amore (24). the rotation
function solution was 43rd in the solutions list. the translation solution had a correlation of 44.5 and r factor of 50.5%.
correlations for wrong peaks of the translation function were
below 42.2. two criteria for selection of the right solution
were used. first, the solution model packed in the unit cell
with formation of an appropriate biologically sensible dimer.
second, the peaks corresponding to the xe heavy atom
positions were present in the difference fourier map for the
xe derivative calculated with mr phases. the mr phases
were used to find heavy-atom-binding sites in difference
fourier syntheses for four other derivatives. the heavy atom
parameters were refined jointly taking into account anomalous dispersion using the program mlphare (25) from the
ccp4 suite (26). the mir phases had a mean figure of merit
of 0.52 at 2.6 å resolution. statistics for the heavy atom
refinement are given in table 1. mir phases were improved
using solvent flattening and histogram matching using the
dm program (27) from the ccp4 suite. the quality of the
map allowed us to trace above 90% of the polypeptide chain
including side chains using residues conserved between csdb
and  xxxg1296xxx  as consistency markers. the model was
built using the program o (28). the coordinate refinement
was carried out using the stereochemically restrained maximum-likelihood method, program refmac, in the ccp4
package (29) coupled with automated building and updating
of the solvent structure using arp (30). the lysine was
refined as an aldimine linkage with the cofactor having a
target bond length of 1.450 å and appropriate bond
geometries. all x-ray data were used with no cutoff on
amplitudes or resolution. in later rounds, tls refinement
was performed by dividing the protein into four domains
(domain i, residues 1-35 and 299-405; domain 2, residues
36-96, 205-241, and 282-298; domain 3, residues 242281; domain 4, residues 97-204). tls refinement dropped
the r factor from 17.8% to 16.1% and rfree from 24.3% to
20.7%, thus validating its use. side chains for residues gln
21, glu 27, arg 87, glu 118, gln 160, gln 164, gln 185,
gln 262, glu 370, and arg 401 were not visible in electron
density maps and were not refined. the orientations of
glutamine, asparagine, and histidine residues were checked,
and hydrogen atoms were added by the program molprobity (31) before the later rounds of refinement. a continuous, nonproteinacious feature in the electron density maps
was modeled as a short  xxxd2982xxx , although it is
possibly a fatty acid on the order of  xxxd2681xxx . statistics
for the final refinement round are given in table 2.
site-directed mutagenesis. mutagenesis of p. fluorescens
 xxxg1296xxx  was performed using the quikchange kit from
stratagene. the mutagenesis primers were designed accord-

ing to the instructions obtained with the kit. all mutant
kynureninases were sequenced to confirm the presence of
the desired mutation and the absence of unintended mutations
elsewhere. the reactions were cycled in a thermocycler as
follows: 1 cycle of 30 s at 95 °c, 16 cycles of 30 s at 95
°c, 1 min at 55 °c, and 8 min at 68 °c. the mutant proteins
were purified as described previously (11).
plp binding measurements were performed with apoenzymes that were obtained by overnight incubation with 0.2
m l-alanine, followed by gel filtration on a pd-10 column
(amersham-pharmacia) to remove the l-alanine and pmp.
assays were performed at 37 °c in a molecular devices
spectramax340 microplate reader. reactions contained 1-10
nm  xxxg1296xxx , except in the case of d201a, where the
enzyme was 1 µm. the reaction mixtures contained, in a
total of 300 ml, 0.04 m potassium phosphate, ph 8, 0.2
mm l-kynurenine, and varying amounts of plp. the
reactions were followed by the decrease in absorbance at
360 nm, after a 5-10 min preincubation to allow plp
binding. the plp activity data were fit to a michaelismenten equation using the program hyper (32) to obtain
the plp binding constant.
sequence analysis. a psi-blast sequence analysis (33)
was performed at the national center for biotechnology
information (ncbi) web server using human and p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  amino acid sequences to build a profile
that was then searched and redefined three times. homologues were aligned using clustal-w (34) in bioedit
(tom hall) that had probability scores above 2e-33. several
bacterial  xxxg1296xxx  amino acid sequences were corrected
at the n-terminus on the basis of sequence alignment and
the presence of obvious shine-dalgarno (35) sequences
incorrectly assigned in the protein sequence. atrazine hydrolase appeared to be at the transition between kynureninases and  xxxg1562xxx  homologues and was not included in the
alignment.
results
purification and crystallization of p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx . because  xxxg1296xxx  failed to crystallize reproducibly
using the previously reported purification scheme, a new
approach to purify the enzyme was developed. attempts to
purify the protein using hydroxyapatite columns were difficult to reproduce, with some batches of protein yielding
high-purity protein and other batches not binding to the
hydroxyapatite column and thus necessitating a different
strategy. the longer protocol, with multiple q columns and
the phenyl-sepharose column, reproducibly produced protein
that crystallized. the enzyme in 5 mm potassium phosphate

when stored at 4 °c for 1 week. we observed an almost
4-fold decrease in enzyme activity when the protein was
stored at -78 °c for 3 months. the enzyme is more stable
in buffer of higher ionic strength. if stored in 0.1 m
phosphate buffer, it is stable toward freezing at -78 °c for
at least one year. attempts to prepare a selenomethionylsubstituted  xxxg1296xxx  for mad phasing from the construct
on plasmid ptz18u proved difficult, with an unacceptably
low yield. the long expression times used with this plasmid
appeared to be detrimental, so the  xxxg1296xxx  gene was
transferred to a pet28b vector (novagen). while the
structure was solved before this plasmid construct was used
to prepare selenomethionyl-modified  xxxg1296xxx , the yield
of the enzyme was significantly improved over that of the
ptz18u construct. thus, the pet28b-based plasmid was
useful for isolation of native  xxxg1296xxx .
three distinct crystal morphologies were identified during
crystallization trials. thin, platelike yellow crystals (0.3 ×
0.2 × 0.03 mm) were obtained by vapor diffusion using a
mixture of lithium chloride (1.2-1.6 m) and peg 8000 (10%
w/v) as the precipitant. the protein drops contained 20-25
mg  xxxg1167xxx   xxxg1296xxx , 0.4 m lithium chloride, and 5% peg
8000. preliminary x-ray studies showed that these crystals
had laue symmetry mmm with unit cell parameters a ) 83.5
å, b ) 89.7 å, and c ) 104.2 å. colorless dagger-like
crystals were obtained when the drop, containing 20 mg/
ml protein, 0.4 m lithium chloride, 3% (w/v) peg 8000,
and 3% (w/v) peg 600, was equilibrated against the reservoir
solution consisting of 1.2 m lithium chloride, 8% (w/v) peg
8000, and 2% (w/v) peg 600. these crystals were rather
small and not suitable for x-ray experiments. crystals
suitable for x-ray diffraction studies were obtained when
the protein (20 mg  xxxg1167xxx  in 5 mm potassium phosphate
buffer and 0.2 mm plp, ph 8.0 or 6.0) was mixed with
0.15-0.2 m (final) lithium chloride and 10% (w/v) peg 400
or 600 and suspended over a reservoir consisting of 2535% (w/v) peg 400 or 600 only or with the addition of
0.15-0.4 m lithium chloride. yellow isometric crystals
appeared in 10-15 days at room temperature and grew to
dimensions of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.4 mm in approximately 1 week.
crystals grown in peg 400 at ph 6.0 were more suitable
for a structure determination both from a size standpoint and
because they could be directly flash frozen with no evidence
of ice crystal formation visible as a haze around the crystal
or in the diffraction pattern.. fresh crystals diffracted beyond
2.0 å resolution, but the quality of the diffraction decreased
markedly with crystal age. they belong to the p3121 space
group with cell dimensions a ) b ) 68.08 å and c ) 138.98
å. these crystals were used for the  xxxg1296xxx  structure
determination.

crystals of  xxxg1296xxx  form readily from precipitate.
the influence of reducing agents on the formation of the
 xxxg1296xxx  crystals was studied by adding dtt, betame, and
tcep to the crystallization drops to achieve final 1-5 mm
concentrations of the reductant in the hanging drops. the
presence of the additives resulted in a significant decrease
of amorphous precipitate from which formation of the
crystals took place (data not shown), but the presence of the
reductant did not improve the diffraction quality, and thus
reductants were not used in further structural studies.
overall fold. the biologically active structure of  xxxg1296xxx , like many plp-dependent enzymes, is a homodimer
(36). with this particular unit cell and the p3121 space group,
a  xxxg1296xxx  monomer makes up the asymmetric unit. its
2-fold related monomer is generated by the symmetry
operator (x - y, -y, 2/3 - z) translated one unit cell along
the crystallographic b axis. electron density is generally well
ordered for residues thr-2 to ala-405, although a few side
chains had weak density. in particular, the side chain of
conserved phe 263 was poorly ordered. the density for the
plp cofactor clearly suggests that a stable aldimine linkage
between lys-227 is present. a single tentative chloride ion
in the active site was assigned on the basis of the strong
electron density feature and a strong anomalous signal in
the native anomalous difference fourier map. all of the
sulfur atoms, with the exception of cys-194, have strong
anomalous difference density, indicating that the data and
final structure are of high quality. the crystal structure has
good geometry with rms deviations from ideal bonds
lengths and angles of 0.009 å and 1.186° (table 2). no nonglycine residues are in the disallowed regions of the
ramachandran plots, while residues leu60, glu118, gln144,
and cys280 are in the generous regions. the final r factor,
including hydrogen atoms, was 15.5% with an rfree of 19.2%
(5% of the data) at 1.85 å resolution. figure 1 illustrates
the overall fold of  xxxg1296xxx . secondary structure elements identified with procheck are associated with the
sequence in figure 2.
 xxxg1296xxx  is structurally most similar to l-cysteine
l-cystine c-s lyase (c-des; pdb accession no. 1elq)
with a close second being the protein used for molecular
replacement, csdb (pdb accession no. 1c0n) (figure 3).
the overall r-carbon rms deviations are 2.3 and 2.8 å over
349 and 368 residues when analyzed by dali. figure 3
illustrates the degree of structural similarity among  xxxg1296xxx , csdb, and c-des. on the basis of the dali fold match
and sequence alignments (12),  xxxg1296xxx  belongs in the
aminotransferase fold type i, class iva. like other fold type
i enzymes, the monomer folds into a “large domain”
(residues 34-301) consisting of a greek-key rbetar fold
containing a seven-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet (s3, s10,
s9, s8, s6, s4, and s5) with seven flanking r-helices (h5,
h10, h9, h8, h7, h6, and  xxxg1956xxx ) and several short beta-strands
(s2, s7, s11, and s12) and outside helices (h3 and h4), all
enfolding the plp cofactor. the “small domain” (residues
302-405) is an rbeta fold with four antiparallel beta-strands (s13,
s14, s15, and s16) and three r-helices (h13, h14, and h15).
like csdb and c-des, there is an n-terminal extension from
the large domain, helices (h1 and h2) that are associated
mainly with the small domain. lys-227 extends from a loop
located between the two domains to interact with the plp
cofactor. when the domains are compared separately, the

rms deviations are smaller than the overall deviation. the
large domains (residues 29-301) superpose with an rms
deviation of 2.2 å with c-des and 2.6 å with csdb. the
small domains (residues 302-403) have rms deviations of
1.6 å with csdb and 2.1 å with c-des. several other plp
proteins, for instance  xxxg1562xxx -like protein (z ) 12.3) and l-allothreonine aldolase (z ) 11.7), have higher z-scores for the
small domain than csdb (6.0) and c-des (5.6).
structure comparisons of  xxxg1296xxx  with csdb and
c-des reveal several regions of structure variation.  xxxg1296xxx  has an extra r-helix at the amino terminus, h1, that is
not present in csdb or c-des (figure 3). some kynureninases, for instance from caenorhabditis elegans, have
appreciably more amino acids at the amino terminus (figure
2). fujii et al. identified several regions of significant
structural differences between csdb and  xxxg1562xxx  that were
denoted dr-a* through dr-d (22). several additional insertions and deletions with respect to c-des and csdb (dr-e
through dr-g) are shown in figure 3 beyond the original
four identified. region dr-a*, located between helices h3

figure 3: stereo representation of superpositioned  xxxg1296xxx , csdb, and c-des. the structures of  xxxg1296xxx  (colored orange),
csdb (1c0n, blue), and c-des (1elq, green) were superpositioned using the “magic fit” and “improve fit” options in swiss-pdbviewer

for csdb (figure 9 of fujii et al. (22)) but extended further here, “dr-a*” for  xxxg1296xxx  residues asn-58 to asp-71 between h3 and h5,

beta-strand s1, “dr-f” for the loops found in csdb and c-des between asp-153 and glu-157 between beta-strand s5 and helix h8, “dr-g” for
the insertion (c-des) between residues glu-193 and ala-196 between helix h9 and beta-strand s8. the ribbon drawing was prepared in

and h5 and thus including h4, extends into the active site
and contributes residues ile-61, trp-64, and trp-69 that are
important in monomer-monomer contacts and may be
involved in substrate recognition. csdb has a more extended
loop between strand a and helix 3 that  xxxg1296xxx  lacks.
region dr-c* provides conserved trp-256* and wellconserved phe-257*. region dr-d of csdb has a helix
missing in c-des and  xxxg1296xxx  that extends near the
active site and directs cys-362 into the active site of this
protein, where it can play a role in catalysis (22). the other
regions (dr-b, dr-e, dr-f, and dr-g), in addition to being
structurally different with respect to csdb and c-des, are
also very variable across the kynureninases (the regions are
also denoted in figure 2 associated with the corresponding
amino acid sequences), suggesting that other kynureninases
would have significant conformational differences there that
are not important in catalytic function.
sequence homology with other kynureninases. sequence
alignments of p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  with other bacterial and eukaryotic kynureninases show that there is high
homology between multiple bacteria and nonplant eukaryotes
(figure 2 and the supporting information). no plant species
were identified in the psi-blast analysis. the unrooted
tree (not shown) clusters the eukaryotic kynureninases (from
s. cerevisiae, neurospora crassa, c. elegans, and homo
sapiens) separately from most of the bacterial enzymes (from
pseudomonas, deinococcus, bordatella, ralstonia, and xanthomonas species, etc). interestingly, the kynureninases of
bacillus anthracis and cytophaga hutchinsonii have higher
sequence homology to the higher organisms and may
represent recovery of the gene from a host.
one cluster of absolutely conserved residues surrounds the
substrate-binding site and defines a pocket around the
pyridine ring of the cofactor (figure 4). conserved active
site residues include asn-35, ser-26, leu-37, phe-129, pro130, asp-132, tyr-176, asp-201, his-204, cys-224, tyr226, lys-227, pro-233, asp-367, arg-369, and arg-375. a
second shell of residues extends from the active site and
defines a set of structurally critical residues that are
hydrophobic. these conserved residues are ile-122, tyr-134,

trp-200, gly-207, leu-213, tyr-220, tyr228, leu-229,
asn230, trp-240, leu-295, phe-298, pro-335, gly-342, pro371, leu-381, tyr-382, and val-388. asp-219 (hydrogen
bonding to highly conserved his-192) is the lone hydrophilic
residue serving to stabilize the packing of helix h9 to helix
h10 and beta-strand s9. a final set of conserved residues is
important in oligomerization. these residues, leu-37, trp56, trp-69, pro-233, and trp-256, lie at the dimer interface.
trp-256 additionally hydrogen bonds to the phosphate
oxygen of the cofactor. interestingly, amino acids surrounding the phosphate of the cofactor are poorly conserved in
the sense that serines (ser-98) and threonines (thr-96, -97,
-131, and -282*) are randomly substituted among the
kynureninases.
several additional amino acids in the kynureninases are
conserved as compensating double mutations. the volume
of trp-64 and neighboring thr-282 in the bacterial kynureninases is largely matched with a histidine/asparagine pair in
the eukaryotes. another compensating mutation set is the
gly-223 and phe-238 (or tyr/ile) pair shifting to tryptophan
and glycine. in this case, most bacteria use gly at 223, with
the interesting exceptions of b. anthracis and c. hutchinsonii.
active site. a schematic picture of the residues associated
with the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate cofactor is shown in figure
5. phe-129 is pi-stacked atop the pyridine ring of the plp
cofactor. there is a hydrogen bond between the internal
aldimine nh and the 3′-o of the plp, with an n-o distance
of 2.68 å. this is consistent with the spectroscopic properties
of  xxxg1296xxx , which shows an absorption maximum at
423 nm (37) that indicates a preference for a ketoenamine
structure for the internal aldimine. in addition, the n of
his-204 is 3.85 å from the 3′-o of plp. his-204 is strictly
conserved in all known sequences of  xxxg1296xxx . although
the distance from his-204 to the 3′-o of plp (3.85 å) and
the geometry are not conducive to hydrogen bonding in the
internal aldimine, his-204 could interact with the 3′-o during
catalysis. the structure shows the conserved asp-201 in the
plp-binding site, which is expected for a member of the
aminotransferase family of plp-dependent enzymes (12). in
addition, the structure has an additional strictly conserved

figure 4: stereoview of the active site region around the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate. panel a illustrates representative electron density
contoured at 1.2sigma (sigmaa weighted 2fo-fc) around the plp cofactor. only a thin slab of density and atoms is shown for clarity. note
the continuous density between lys-227 and the cofactor and the well-defined density around aspartates 132 and 201. extraneous density
modeled as a  xxxd2982xxx  polymer is visible on the left-hand side of the cofactor. panel b represents a view looking at the cofactor
roughly from the bulk solvent. residues from the 2-fold symmetry related monomer are denoted with an asterisk.

are indicated in angstroms.

aspartate, asp-132, which is located at a similar distance
from the plp nitrogen (figure 5). there is significant
electron density located between asp-132 and asp-201, and
the distance between odelta of asp-132 and odelta of asp-201 is
2.50 å, indicating that a hydrogen bond is likely between
the two aspartates. the short distance between the two
aspartates suggests that there may be a low-barrier hydrogen
bond (38).

the phosphate oxygens are surrounded by a variety of
hydrogen bond donors. trp-256* and thr-282* from the
other chain of the dimer donate hydrogen bonds to one of
the oxygens. the nr-h and the ogamma of ser-98 are located in
hydrogen-bonding distance from another phosphate oxygen,
as is the ogamma of thr-96. tyr-226 and thr-97 provide hydrogen
bonds to the third phosphate oxygen. of the residues involved
in phosphate binding, only tyr-226 and trp-256 are strictly
conserved. while many plp-dependent enzymes stabilize
the phosphate charge via an ionic interaction, for instance
using a histidine (csdb, c-des, and even the distantly
related  xxxg1626xxx ),  xxxg1296xxx  has no basic
residues nearby to provide this charge stabilization. like
other aminotransferase-like enzymes, a helix dipole from
r-helix h6 is appropriately oriented to provide some charge
stabilization.
an atom, most likely a chloride ion, sits in the active site
where the carboxyl group of the substrate would normally
interact. this is similar to the acetate ion found in the
structures of the related enzymes c-des and csdb. assignment of the atom as a chloride ion was made on the basis of
the strong anomalous signal of this ion, its presence in the
crystallization buffer, and the strong electron density.
one further feature of the  xxxg1296xxx  structure is the
presence of extraneous electron density near the active site

(figure 4). since the crystals were prepared in low molecular
weight  xxxd2982xxx , it may be a tightly bound
molecule of peg. alternatively, it could be a fatty acid
maintained through purification. the uncharacterized molecule actually occupies the same region as an extra loop (12
additional amino acids) found in csdb (thr-360 to met377 of csdb, which corresponds to region dr-d, figure 3)
that is absent in the kynureninases. the eukaryotic, as well
as b. anthracis and c. hutchinsonii, kynureninases have small
insertions of two additional amino acids in this region. many
of the residues surrounding the putative peg molecule are
conserved, so this may have biological implications and
certainly offers an extra handle for drug design. one further
important point to make related to this extraneous feature is
that this molecule may be occupying a site normally filled
by residues his-259* through glu-266* of  xxxg1296xxx 
(region dr-c*). this loop was difficult to trace because of
poor electron density. phe-263* is located in the middle of
this loop and has very poor side-chain electron density. this
is quite surprising and was cause for alarm during initial
model building because it is absolutely conserved. the
explanation for the poor side-chain electron density of an
absolutely conserved residue could be that the loop normally
is associated with the active site, and that it has been
displaced in the crystal structure by a crystallization reagent,
peg.
mutagenesis of asp-132 and asp-201. we prepared the
ala and glu mutants of asp-132 and asp-201 by sitedirected mutagenesis to probe their roles in plp binding and
catalysis. surprisingly, both d132e and d201e kynureninases have good activity and plp binding stronger than that
of the wild-type enzyme (table 3). however, d132a
 xxxg1296xxx  has lower activity and binds plp weakly (table
3). d201a  xxxg1296xxx  has very low activity, less than
0.01% of that of the wild-type enzyme, binds plp weakly,
and expresses poorly, giving large amounts of insoluble
inclusion bodies and very low levels of soluble protein. this
is expected, since asp-201 is homologous to the conserved
plp-binding aspartate found in all members of the aminotransferase family (12).
discussion
 xxxg1296xxx  is an enzyme in tryptophan catabolism that
is inducible in bacteria such as p. fluorescens, but which is
constitutive in eukaryotes (1). however, n. crassa was
reported to have both inducible and constitutive kynureninases (39). the inducible  xxxg1296xxx  reacts with lkynurenine, while the constitutive enzyme reacts preferentially with 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine (1). the constitutive
 xxxg1296xxx  plays a key role in the pathway for de novo
synthesis of nad(p)+ in eukaryotes. there is homology, and
significant identity, in all known  xxxg1296xxx  sequences,

biochemistry, vol. 43, no. 5, 2004 1201
from bacteria to man (figure 2). thus, both inducible and
constitutive kynureninases must have a similar fold and threedimensional structure. we note that the majority of the
conserved residues in figure 2 are located in or very near
the plp-binding site. the structure confirms the prediction
from sequence alignment that lys-227 is the plp-binding
residue in p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx .
sequence alignment of  xxxg1296xxx  with other plpdependent enzymes shows that  xxxg1296xxx  is in subgroup
iva of the aminotransferases, along with  xxxg1562xxx , csdb, and
serine-pyruvate aminotransferase (12). indeed, the coordinates of csdb were used for molecular replacement in the
solution of the structure of  xxxg1296xxx , after molecular
replacement failed with both aspartate aminotransferase and
tyrosine phenol-lyase coordinates. it is interesting to note
that all of the members of subgroup iva share similar
reaction characteristics, in that they catalyze either beta-elimination reactions with electrophilic replacement or transamination, resulting in l-alanine as a product.
all plp-dependent enzymes in the aminotransferase
family have an aspartate residue in close contact with the
plp pyridine n1, to keep it protonated to enhance the
electrophilicity of the cofactor (12). the sequence alignment
predicts that asp-201, which is strictly conserved in kynureninases, is the corresponding residue in p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx . we do observe in the structure that asp-201 is near
the plp nitrogen, but in addition, we find that asp-132 is
also at a similar distance and is also strictly conserved. the
results show that both residues contribute to plp binding,
but asp-201 has a much greater contribution to activity. tyr226 is the residue just preceding the plp-binding lysine, and
this residue is strictly conserved in kynureninases, although
tyrosine is not found in this position in any other plpdependent enzyme. the structure shows that tyr-226 donates
a hydrogen bond to the phosphate of the plp. however, it
is not uncommon for aminotransferases to have a tyrosine
involved in plp binding. in aspartate aminotransferase, tyr70 donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate of plp, and
serves mainly to bind plp (40). in the case of tyrosine
phenol-lyase, tyr-71 donates a hydrogen bond to the plp
phosphate in the internal aldimine, but also is a general acid
for the elimination step of the reaction (41). trp-256, which
is strictly conserved in kynureninases, also donates a
hydrogen bond to the phosphate through the indole n1
hydrogen. to our knowledge, the participation of a tryptophan residue in plp binding through the phosphate is
unique to  xxxg1296xxx  and c-des. finally, the strictly
conserved phe-129 is pi-stacked on the pyridine ring of plp.
this is also commonly observed in aminotransferase family
members.
we have studied the mechanism of  xxxg1296xxx  previously using both steady-state (42) and pre-steady-state kinetic
techniques (37). the ph dependence of kcat/km showed that
there is only a single catalytic base, with a pka of 6.25,
required for multiple proton transfers during the reaction (42).
the most likely residue for the base is lys-227, since it
requires a great deal of dexterity. the catalytic base must
remove the proton from the r-carbon of the kynurenine
external aldimine ( xxxg1229xxx ) and then protonate c-4′ of the
quinonoid intermediate (eq1) (scheme 1). it then assists
water in addition to the gamma-carbonyl of the ketimine intermediate (ek1) to form the gem-diolate (ed), protonates the

1202 biochemistry, vol. 43, no. 5, 2004
beta-carbon of the enamine (ee), and finally shuttles the proton
from c-4′ of the pyruvate ketimine (ek2) back to cr to give
the alanine external aldimine ( xxxg302xxx ). the sequence alignment
of  xxxg1296xxx  with the other members of the aminotransferase family shows a conserved arginine residue, arg-375,
which is homologous to the substrate r-carboxylate-binding
site in other members of the family. in our structure, the
carboxylate of l-alanine can be docked with arg-375 with
the amino group oriented toward the plp lys-227 schiff
base to undergo external aldimine formation (data not
shown). thus, our results confirm that arg-375 is a substratebinding residue. in the present structure, the putative r-carboxylate-binding site is occupied by a sphere of electron
density, probably a chloride ion, which provides confirmation
that it is an anion-binding site.
the structure of p. fluorescens  xxxg1296xxx  reported
herein provides information essential for the future testing
of the role of active site residues in the mechanism of the
reaction using site-directed mutagenesis. in addition, the
homology with eukaryotic, especially human (28% identity),
kynureninases will allow for the convenient structure determination in the future using the molecular replacement
method. the structure of human  xxxg1296xxx  will help in
the design of novel, potent, and specific inhibitors, which
may be of value as cns active drugs.
