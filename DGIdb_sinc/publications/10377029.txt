2 enzyme (11b- xxxg1085xxx ), which converts maternal cortisol to
its inactive metabolite, cortisone, plays a pivotal role in
restricting the passage of maternal cortisol to the fetus [4].
therefore, it is proposed that placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  serves
as a barrier to protect the fetus from high levels of maternal
glucocorticoids [5]. recent studies have provided circumstantial evidence in support of this hypothesis.
immunohistochemistry studies have localized 11 b  xxxg1085xxx  exclusively in the syncytiotrophoblast, the site of
maternal-fetal exchange [6]. in both humans and rats, there
is a positive correlation between placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity and birth weight [7, 8]. moreover, placental 11bhsd2 activity is attenuated in pregnancies complicated
with iugr [9, 10], and iugr is a characteristic feature of
the apparent mineralocorticoid excess [11], a syndrome resulting from 11b- xxxg1085xxx  deficiency [12].
previous studies have shown that progesterone, estradiol,
and  xxxd2738xxx  attenuate, while agonists of the  xxxg1836xxx  pathway and  xxxd3417xxx  up-regulate 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity and mrna in cultured primary human placental
trophoblast and/or human choriocarcinoma jeg-3 cells
[13–17]. several elegant studies in the baboon have also
provided convincing evidence that estrogen increases the
placental 11b-hsd dehydrogenase activity (cortisol to cortisone) both in vivo and in vitro [18–20].
given that eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are produced in the placenta and are intimately
involved in pregnancy and parturition [21, 22], we hypothesized that these locally produced factors regulate the activity of placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx . in the present study, we examined the effects of the products of cyclooxygenase and
lipoxygenase pathways in  xxxd208xxx  metabolism on
11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3 cells. this syncytiotrophoblast-like cell line has retained the ability to convert cortisol
to cortisone and therefore has been used widely for investigation of the regulation of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  [13, 14, 17, 23].
moreover, jeg-3 cells produce a range of placental hormones/factors, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes
[24–26]. here we present the first evidence that prostaglandin (pg) e2 and f2a and leukotriene b4 (ltb4) inhibit
11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity without affecting its steady-state mrna
level in jeg-3 cells.

abstract
the 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11b- xxxg1085xxx )
is responsible for the inactivation of glucocorticoids. this is the
predominant isozyme in the human placenta, where it is proposed to protect the fetus from high levels of maternal cortisol.
in the present study, we examined the effects of eicosanoids on
the activity of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  in human choriocarcinoma jeg-3
cells, a well-established model for placental trophoblasts. treatment of jeg-3 cells for 24 h with either prostaglandin (pg) e2
or f2a attenuated 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity (;40%). paradoxically, indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, inhibited (;40%)
rather than stimulated the activity of this enzyme. this indicated
that the  xxxd208xxx  metabolism may be diverted to other
pathway(s), the products of which may inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity. to determine whether the lipoxygenase pathways were involved, the cells were treated with  xxxd2748xxx 
( xxxd2748xxx ), a blocker of all three (5-, 12-, and 15-) lipoxygenases.
 xxxd2748xxx  caused a 3-fold increase in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity. to further
delineate which specific lipoxygenase pathway was involved, the
cells were incubated with  xxxd3554xxx , a selective inhibitor of 5lipoxygenase. this resulted in a similar increase in 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity, suggesting that the products of this pathway (e.g., leukotrienes) may be involved. given that leukotriene b4 (ltb4) is
the most biologically active product of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway, we treated the cells with ltb4, which inhibited 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner with a maximal
effect (60% reduction)  xxxd1891xxx  nm for 9 h. semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed
that 11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna levels were not altered by the addition
of ltb4, pge2, or  xxxd1902xxx , indicating an effect at the posttranscriptional level. in conclusion, these results demonstrate that
prostaglandins and ltb4 are potent inhibitors of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3 cells, suggesting that placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity
is modulated by these locally produced eicosanoids. this is the
first time that the products of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism have
been found to regulate the activity of 11b- xxxg1085xxx .

introduction

glucocorticoids are essential for normal fetal organ
growth and maturation, but excessive exposure to glucocorticoids in utero leads to intrauterine growth restriction
(iugr) and possibly affects postnatal life [1, 2]. fetal exposure to glucocorticoids is controlled by many factors, including fetal adrenal production, circulating corticosteroidbinding globulin concentrations, intracellular metabolism,
and the transplacental transfer of maternal glucocorticoids
[3]. the placental 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type

were omnisolve grade from  xxxg257xxx  inc. (toronto, on, canada). general molecular biology reagents were from gibco
brl (burlington, on, canada) or pharmacia canada inc.
(baie d’urte, pq, canada). the jeg-3 cell line was purchased from american type culture collection (rockville,
md). cell culture supplies were obtained from gibco brl
or fisher scientific. pge2 and  xxxd1902xxx  were generously donated by dr. t.g. kennedy (university of western ontario,
london, on, canada).
cell culture and treatments

jeg-3 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium
eagle (mem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/
streptomycin. cells were maintained in t-25 corning
(corning, ny) flasks at 378c in a 95% air:5% co2 humidified incubator. the medium was changed every other day.
the cells were passaged as required. to study the effects
of eicosanoids on 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity, cells were plated
onto 12-well corning plates and cultured to confluence.
the cells were then cultured in serum-free medium for 24
h before treatment, and all the treatments were carried out
under serum-free conditions. cells in triplicate wells were
exposed to given doses of eicosanoids or inhibitors for 24
h or as stated otherwise. controls (also in triplicate) were
treated similarly but without the addition of eicosanoids or
inhibitors. for 11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna analysis, cells were subjected to identical culture and treatment conditions as described above except that they were maintained in t-25
flasks.
assay of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity—radiometric
conversion assay

at the end of treatment, the cells were washed three
times in serum-free medium to remove the treatment compound, in an attempt to exclude its having a possible competitive inhibition. the level of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in intact
cells was determined by measuring the rate of cortisol to
cortisone conversion, as described previously [17]. briefly,
the cells were incubated for 4 h at 378c in serum-free medium containing ;100 000 cpm [3h]cortisol and 10 nm
unlabeled cortisol. at the end of incubation, the medium
was collected, and steroids were extracted. the extracts
were dried, and the residues were resuspended. a fraction
of the resuspension was spotted on a tlc plate, which was
developed in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v:v). the bands
containing the labeled cortisol and cortisone were identified
by uv light of the cold carriers, cut out into scintillation
vials, and counted in scintisafe econol 1 (fisher scientific,
toronto, on, canada). the rate of cortisol to cortisone conversion was calculated, and the blank values (defined as the
amount of conversion in the absence of cells) were subtracted and expressed as a percentage of control. results
are shown as mean 6 sem. under conditions of the present
study, the basal level of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3 cells
was 8–12%. one-way anova followed by dunnett’s test
was used to determine statistical differences. significance
was set at p , 0.05.

cellular rna was extracted from jeg-3 cells, 1 mg of which was used as
a template to produce cdna as described in materials and methods.
different amounts (0.7, 2, and 6 ml) of cdna was subjected to 32 cycles
of pcr, and 2 ml of cdna was subjected to different cycles (28, 32, and
36) of pcr, using specific primers to amplify a 397-base pair product
encoding the human 11b- xxxg1085xxx .

alterations in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna, the relative abundance of
11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna in jeg-3 cells was assessed by an established semiquantitative rt-pcr protocol, as described
[17]. briefly, total rna was extracted from cultured cells
using an rneasy kit (qiagen inc., mississauga, on, canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. before
use, the rna samples (1–2 mg) were checked by agarose
gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde, and
the integrity of the rna was assessed by the presence of
two sharp bands representing 28s and 18s rrna after
staining with ethidium bromide. one microgram of total
rna was reverse-transcribed using a standard oligo-dt
primer in a total volume of 20 ml. an aliquot (2 ml) of the
rt reaction products was then subjected to a standard pcr
(958c, 55 sec; 558c, 55 sec; 728c, 1 min; 32 cycles) using
sequence-specific primers (forward primer, 5 9 -agtagttgctgatgcgga; reverse primer, 59-catgcaagtgctcgatgt) that correspond to nucleotides 624–
641 and 1004–1021 in the published human 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
cdna [27], respectively. glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) was used as a control. the same pcr
conditions were used for  xxxg861xxx  except that a cycle number of 25 instead of 32 was used. the primers for  xxxg861xxx 
(forward primer, 59-accacagtccatgccatcac; reverse primer, 59-tccaccaccctgttgctgta) were obtained from clontech laboratories inc. (palo alto, ca),
and they correspond to nucleotides 586–605 and 1018–
1037 in the published human  xxxg861xxx  cdna [28]. the
pcr conditions for 11b- xxxg1085xxx  were chosen after performing preliminary studies demonstrating that the amount of
rt products (2 ml) and the cycle number (32) were within
the linear range (fig. 1). similar experiments were performed to determine the pcr conditions for  xxxg861xxx  (data
not shown).
to verify the rt-pcr products and to assess the relative
abundance of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna, a fraction of the rt-pcr
products was then subjected to a standard southern blot
analysis, using 32p-labeled human 11b- xxxg1085xxx  cdna and
32p-labeled human  xxxg861xxx  cdna as probes. a total of 3
independent experiments were conducted, and data from a
representative experiment are shown.

observed for both prostaglandins. when the cells were
treated for 24 h with 1 mg/ml of pge2 or  xxxd1902xxx , a similar
inhibition was observed (fig. 2). to investigate the effects
of blocking prostaglandin synthesis, jeg-3 cells were treated for 24 h with 10 mm indomethacin, an inhibitor of the
cyclooxygenase enzymes. paradoxically, indomethacin inhibited (;40%) rather than stimulated the activity of this
enzyme, indicating that another pathway(s) of arachidonic
acid metabolism may exert more potent inhibitory effects
on 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity, or that other prostanoids (pgi2,
 xxxg1073xxx , or thromboxanes) may exert a stimulating effect that
may override prostaglandin-induced inhibition (figs. 2 and
3).

in intact cells was determined by measuring the rate of cortisol (10 nm)
to cortisone conversion. bars represent the mean 6 sem of 3–6 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. results are expressed as

treated for 24 h with 1 mm  xxxd2748xxx , an inhibitor of all three
(5-, 12-, and 15-) lipoxygenase pathways.  xxxd2748xxx  caused a
3-fold increase in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity (fig. 4). to examine
possible interactions between the products of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases,  xxxd2748xxx  was used in combination
with indomethacin. although not statistically significant,
there was an apparent potentiation of  xxxd2748xxx -induced stimulation of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  by the addition of indomethacin (data
not shown). to further delineate which specific lipoxygenase pathway was involved in attenuating 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity, jeg-3 cells were treated for 24 h with 10 mm  xxxd3554xxx ,
an inhibitor of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway (fig. 3). this
resulted in a 3-fold increase in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity, similar
to that observed when the cells were treated with  xxxd2748xxx 
(fig. 4).
effects of ltb4 on 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity

given that ltb4 is the most biologically active product
of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway, jeg-3 cells were treated
with 10 nm ltb4 for different lengths of time (3, 6, 9, 12,
and 24 h). significant inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity was
observed by 3 h, with a maximal inhibition (;60%) by 9
h in culture (fig. 5). when the cells were exposed to different concentrations of ltb4, ranging from 0.1 to 100 nm
for 9 h, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the level
of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity with a maximal response  xxxd1891xxx  nm
(fig. 6).

in order to determine whether decreases in 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity following pge2,  xxxd1902xxx  and ltb4 treatment are due
to changes in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna, the relative level of 11bhsd2 mrna was assessed by semiquantitative rt-pcr
analysis. treatment of jeg-3 cells with 1 mg/ml and 5 mg/
ml of either pge2 or  xxxd1902xxx  for 24 h, or with 10 nm ltb4
from 1.5 to 6 h, did not alter the levels of 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
mrna (fig. 7).

discussion

in the present study, we have demonstrated for the first
time that prostaglandins and ltb4 are potent inhibitors of
11b- xxxg1085xxx  bioactivity in jeg-3 cells, a model for the human placental trophoblast. if these eicosanoids inhibit 11bhsd2 activity in the human placenta in vivo, the present
findings suggest that these locally produced eicosanoids
could potentially increase the transplacental transfer of maternal cortisol to the fetus and thus influence fetal development.
given that both human placental trophoblast and jeg-3
cells endogenously produce pge2,  xxxd1902xxx , and ltb4, in addition to a range of other hormones/factors and enzymes
[21, 24–26, 29], the use of jeg-3 cells in the present study
is appropriate and relevant to human placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
physiology. in the present study, we demonstrated that
ltb4 at nanomolar concentrations, which are well within
the physiological levels found in human umbilical plasma
[30], was effective in attenuating 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in
jeg-3 cells. similarly, we observed a significant decrease
in 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in these cells when treated with 10
ng/ml of pge2 or  xxxd1902xxx . this concentration is comparable
with that found in human placental tissue homogenates at
term [31]. therefore, the present findings suggest that these
locally produced eicosanoids may inhibit the activity of placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  under physiological conditions.
prostaglandins have previously been shown to play a key
role in the initiation of labor by enhancing uterine contractility [32, 33]. they are produced locally during pregnancy
by maternal myometrium and decidua, and by fetal membranes and placenta [31]. similarly, placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  is
present from early gestation and remains active throughout
pregnancy and during labor [34–36]. if the inhibitory effects of prostaglandins on 11b- xxxg1085xxx  occur in the human
placenta in vivo, this would lead to greater amounts of maternal cortisol crossing the placenta into fetal circulation.
the increased fetal exposure to maternal cortisol by prostaglandins could adversely affect fetal organ growth and

jeg-3 cells were incubated for 9 h with the indicated concentrations of
ltb4 in the absence of serum. at the end of treatment, the level of 11bhsd2 activity in intact cells was determined by measuring the rate of
cortisol (10 nm) to cortisone conversion. bars represent the mean 6 sem
of 3–4 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. results are
expressed as the percentage of the 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3 cells without any treatment. * p , 0.05 and ** p , 0.01 when compared with

maturation [1, 2]. likewise, fetal protection from maternal
glucocorticoids by the placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  could also be
jeopardized by elevated intrauterine ltb4 concentrations,
since, as our present study has demonstrated, at physiological concentrations, ltb4 exerts potent inhibitory effects on
11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3 cells. within the intrauterine
environment, ltb4 is produced by the placenta and fetal
membranes [22]. however, another important source of leukotrienes is the production by leukocytes and macrophages,
which are often recruited in response to an infection, usually causing inflammation [37]. it is noteworthy that recent
clinical reports have associated fetal growth restriction with
inflammation. in one study, it was shown that 41% of nor-

h) in serum free medium. at the end of treatment, total cellular rna was
extracted and subjected to a semiquantitative rt-pcr, followed by southern blotting, as described in materials and methods. a total of 3 independent experiments were conducted, and the results from one representative experiment are shown.

motensive mothers who had lesions of decidual vasculopathy and/or chronic inflammation had very low birth
weight infants [38]. other studies have correlated iugr
with massive infiltration of mononuclear cells in the intervillous space (massive chronic intervillositis) [39]. during
an infection and inflammation, this additional source of
ltb4 could potentially cause greater transfer of maternal
glucocorticoids across the placenta to the fetus, exerting
deleterious effects on fetal development. it will be important to determine if indeed placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity is
attenuated under these pathological conditions.
in the present study, we have also demonstrated that
there are no corresponding changes in the steady-state level
of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  mrna in jeg-3 cells after treatment with
pge2,  xxxd1902xxx , or ltb4, indicating an effect at the posttranscriptional level. although it remains possible that these
eicosanoids may interact directly with the 11b- xxxg1085xxx  enzyme as inhibitors of enzyme activity, this is unlikely given
that the cells were washed three times to remove these compounds before the addition of the substrate for 11b- xxxg1085xxx ,
in an attempt to exclude their having a possible competitive
inhibition. there are two potential mechanisms by which
these eicosanoids inhibit 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3 cells.
it is conceivable that these eicosanoids may inhibit the
translation of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  protein. alternatively, they may
be involved in the posttranslational modification of 11bhsd2 protein. obviously, further studies are required to
determine the precise mechanisms by which this inhibition
is achieved.
indomethacin, a blocker of the cyclooxygenase pathway
and thus prostanoid synthesis, resulted in an unexpected
inhibition of 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity. there are two potential
explanations for this apparent paradox. in a recent study, it
has been shown that there is more metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  via the lipoxygenase pathway than the cyclooxygenase pathways in jeg-3 cells [26]. therefore, when
the cyclooxygenase pathway is blocked, it is possible that
more  xxxd208xxx  would be available for metabolism
to other lipoxygenase and cytochrome p450 pathway products, which would attenuate 11b- xxxg1085xxx  activity in jeg-3
cells. alternatively, other prostanoids, such as prostacyclin,
 xxxd14xxx , and/or thromboxanes may stimulate 11bhsd2 to a greater extent than the inhibitory effect observed
by prostaglandins e2 and f2a. therefore, when indomethacin is used to block all prostanoid synthesis, this stimulation would be removed, resulting in a decrease in 11bhsd2 activity. although our present results provide support for the former explanation, the possibility of the two
operating concomitantly cannot be ruled out.
in summary, the present study has demonstrated that
prostaglandins and ltb4 are potent inhibitors of 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
activity in jeg-3 cells, suggesting that placental 11b- xxxg1085xxx 
is under the control of locally produced eicosanoids. whatever their mechanisms of action, this is the first report providing direct evidence that the products of  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism regulate the activity of 11b- xxxg1085xxx .
