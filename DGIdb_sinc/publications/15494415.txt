intestinal cholesterol absorption is a main regulator of serum
cholesterol homeostasis (1) involving digestion and hydrolysis of
dietary lipids with formation of mixed micelles containing cholesterol, bile salts,  xxxd2154xxx , and phospholipids (2). the molecular mechanisms being involved in cholesterol absorption are not
understood but the findings of a strong species difference (2),
sterol specificity (3), and the existence of specific cholesterol absorption inhibitors (4, 5) strongly argue for a protein-mediated
process. several proteins have been suggested as candidates for
the putative intestinal cholesterol transporter (6 –10) but for
none has evidence as a cholesterol uptake system been presented.
investigations with caco2 cells have shown that cholesterol
taken up from mixed cholesterol bile salt micelles is distributed
into the brush border membrane and is moved to detergentresistant microdomains (rafts) followed by transport from these
microdomains to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification and
further assembly into chylomicron particles that are secreted by
the enterocyte (11). this suggests that cholesterol absorption
occurs by a complex process involving several proteins rather
than by a single cholesterol transporter. consequently, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in intestinal cholesterol
absorption we attempted to identify the protein components of
this machinery by photoaffinity labeling using photoreactive analogues of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe (12, 13)
(fig. 1) and of cholesterol (14). with photoreactive ezetimibe
derivatives we identified an integral 145-kda membrane protein
as the target protein for cholesterol absorption inhibitors in the
enterocyte brush border membrane (12, 13), whereas an integral
80-kda membrane protein was identified as a specific cholesterol-binding protein (15). the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein
showed an exclusive affinity for cholesterol absorption inhibitors,
but did not bind cholesterol or phytosterols. vice versa, the 80kda cholesterol-binding protein only bound cholesterol and plant
sterols without showing affinity for cholesterol absorption inhibitors. both binding proteins have an identical tissue distribution
restricted to the anatomical site of cholesterol absorption, the
small intestine (13, 15). in the present article we localized the
molecular mode of action of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to
the luminal side of the small enterocyte brush border membrane
and identified the 145-kda target protein for ezetimibe in the
enterocyte brush border membrane as the ectoenzyme  xxxg163xxx  ((alanyl) aminopeptidase;  xxxg163xxx ; leukemia antigen
 xxxg163xxx ).

intestinal cholesterol absorption is an important
regulator of serum cholesterol levels. ezetimibe is a
specific inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption
recently introduced into medical practice; its mechanism of action, however, is still unknown. ezetimibe
neither influences the release of cholesterol from
mixed micelles in the gut lumen nor the transfer of
cholesterol to the enterocyte brush border membrane.
with membrane-impermeable ezetimibe analogues we
could demonstrate that binding of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to the brush border membrane of small
intestinal enterocytes from the gut lumen is sufficient
for inhibition of cholesterol absorption.  xxxd3024xxx -kda integral membrane protein was identified as the molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors in the
enterocyte brush border membrane by photoaffinity
labeling with photoreactive ezetimibe analogues
(kramer, w., glombik, h., petry, s., heuer, h., schäfer,
h. l., wendler, w., corsiero, d., girbig, f., and weyland, c.
(2000) febs lett. 487, 293–297). the 145-kda ezetimibebinding protein was purified by three different methods
and sequencing revealed its identity with the membrane-bound ectoenzyme  xxxg163xxx  ((alanyl)aminopeptidase;  xxxg163xxx ; apn; leukemia antigen
 xxxg163xxx ). the enzymatic activity of apn was not influenced by ezetimibe (analogues). the uptake of cholesterol delivered by mixed micelles by confluent caco-2
cells was partially inhibited by ezetimibe and nonabsorbable ezetimibe analogues. preincubation of confluent caco-2 cells with ezetimibe led to a strong decrease
of fluorescent apn staining with a monoclonal antibody
in the plasma membrane. independent on its enzymatic
activity,  xxxg163xxx  is involved in endocytotic
processes like the uptake of viruses. our findings suggest that binding of ezetimibe to apn from the lumen of
the small intestine blocks endocytosis of cholesterolrich membrane microdomains, thereby limiting intestinal cholesterol absorption.

cholesterol absorption and transport measurements
intestinal cholesterol absorption was determined by a modification of
the zilversmit/hughes method (23) as described earlier (12). cholesterol
monomerization activity from mixed micelles was determined by measurement of the dequenching of fluoresterol-labeled cholesterol micelles
using the assay described by cai et al. (24). the uptake of [3h]cholesterol
from mixed micelles by rabbit small intestinal bbmv was determined as
described by compassi et al. (25) using mixed micelles prepared by mixing
10 ␮m [3h]cholesterol with a solution of 4 mm  xxxd3296xxx  and 0.6 mm
sodium  xxxd2777xxx  in 50 mm tris/hcl buffer (ph 7.4), 150 mm nacl buffer,
followed by sonification and evaporation of chloroform. uptake was measured by mixing bbmv (20 ␮g of protein) in 50 ␮l of 10 mm tris/hepes
buffer (ph 7.4), 100 mm nacl, 100 mm mannitol in the absence or presence
of 150 ␮m of the respective ezetimibe analogues with 50 ␮l of the mixed
micelle suspension, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g for 120 s
after the indicated incubation times and subsequently radioactivity in the
pelleted material and the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

sds-gel electrophoresis

purification of the ezetimibe-binding protein from
enterocyte bbmv

sds-page was carried out in vertical stab gels (20 ⫻ 17 ⫻ 0.15 cm)
using an electrophoresis system le 2/4 (amersham biosciences) with
gel concentrations of 7–10.5% at a ratio of 97.2% acrylamide and 2.8%
n,n-methylene bisacrylamide or in pre-casted novex gels (4 –12, 12,
or 15%, invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands) using an electrophoresis system xcell ii from novex (27). after electrophoresis the gels
were fixed in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid followed by staining with serva
blue r 250. for determination of the distribution of radioactivity,
individual gel lanes were cut into 2-mm pieces, protein was hydrolyzed
with 250 ␮l of tissue solubilizer biolute s, and after addition of 4 ml of
scintillator quickszint 501 radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. western blotting and immunostaining was performed as described earlier (27).

solubilization of bbmv was performed at a protein concentration of
1 mg/ml for 60 min at 4 °c in 10 mm tris/hepes buffer (ph 7.4), 75 mm
kcl, 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm egta, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% n-octyl glucoside, 1% triton x-100, 1 mm  xxxd502xxx  (“solubilization buffer”) followed
by centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g for 30 min. alternatively, bbmv were
first solubilized in 0.25% n-lauroylsarcosine at 4 °c for 30 min, followed
by a 10-fold dissolution with solubilization buffer.
wheat germ lectin and hydroxylapatite chromatography after photoaffinity labeling with 3h-labeled ezetimibe photoprobes—eight
samples of rabbit ileal bbmv (250 ␮g of protein) were incubated each
with 66 nm (0.3 ␮ci) of [3h]c-1 or 3 ␮m (1 ␮ci) [3h]c-2 in 10 mm
tris/hepes buffer (ph 7.4), 100 mm nacl, 100 mm mannitol for 30 min
at 20 °c in the dark. after irradiation for 30 s ([3h]c-1) or 120 s

caco-2 cells (atcc htb-37) were grown at 37 °c and 10% co2 in

 xxxd2212xxx  (invitrogen 25030), 1% nonessential amino acids (invitrogen
11140), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (invitrogen 15140). to
perform a cholesterol uptake assay, confluent caco-2 cells from a 175cm2 flask (bd biosciences) were washed once with pbs (invitrogen
14190), treated with 4 ml of trypsin-edta solution (invitrogen 25300),
resuspended in a 6-ml culture medium, and counted in a counting
device (schaerfe system, casy tt). cells were diluted in culture medium to a final concentration of 1 ⫻ 106 cells/ml. each well of a 24-well

photoaffinity labeling
bbmv prepared from the indicated tissues were incubated with the
indicated concentrations (see legends to figures) of ezetimibe-photoaffinity probes in 10 mm tris/hcl buffer (ph 7.4), 100 mm nacl, 100 mm
mannitol for 60 min at 20 °c in the dark followed by irradiation in a
rayonet-rpr-photochemical reactor rpr-100 (the southern ultraviolet company, hamden, ct) equipped with 4 rpr 2530-å lamps for 30 s
(c-1, c-4, c-5) or 120 s (c-2). afterward, bbmv were diluted with 10
mm tris/hcl buffer (ph 7.4), 300 mm mannitol, 1 mm  xxxd502xxx  and
washed with this buffer 3 times followed by sds-page.

male new zealand white rabbits weighing 4 –5 kg (harlan winkelmann, borchem, germany) were kept on altromin® standard diet c
2023 (altromin®, lage, germany) ad libitum. brush border membrane
vesicles (bbmv) from rabbit stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, and kidney were prepared by the mg2⫹ precipitation method as described earlier (20). for preparation of bbmv from
small intestinal segments, the small intestine from 2 rabbits was divided in 8 segments of equal length (numbered 1 to 8 from duodenum to
ileum) and bbmv were prepared and characterized as described (20).
rat liver microsomes and rat adipocyte membranes were prepared as
described elsewhere (21, 22).

([3h]c-2) at 254 nm the samples were collected and after washing three
times membrane proteins were solubilized with solubilization buffer.
the supernatant containing solubilized membrane proteins was added to
0.5 ml of wheat germ lectin-agarose gel. after 60 min at 20 °c the beads
were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 2 ml of 10 mm
pbs, 1% n-octyl glucoside. adsorbed proteins were eluted with 4 portions
of 1 ml of 10 mm pbs, 1% n-octyl glucoside, 300 mm n-acetyl-dglucosamine each. the  xxxd2683xxx  eluates were diluted to 10
ml with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (self-filled, 10 cm height, 1
cm diameter; or bio-rad cht-ii columns) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside at a flow rate
of 0.15 ml/min and collection of 1-ml fractions. subsequently proteins
were eluted as follows: 10 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4),
1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside followed by linear phosphate gradients in the
above buffer. in each fraction the activity of  xxxg163xxx , sucrase,
and cholesterol monomerization as well as radioactivity was determined.
from each fraction 100-␮l aliquots were analyzed by sds-page with
subsequent determination of the distribution of radioactively labeled
proteins, after precipitation of proteins with chloroform/methanol (26).
streptavidin-biotin chromatography after photolabeling with c-4 or

c-5 in 10 mm tris/hepes buffer (ph 7.4), 100 mm nacl, 100 mm mannitol for 30 min in the dark at 20 °c followed by irradiation at 254 nm
for 30 s. after washing, proteins were solubilized and the clear supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of streptavidin-agarose beads and kept
under stirring at 4 °c for 2 h. after centrifugation, the beads were
incubated with 2 ml of 10 mm tris/hepes buffer (ph 7.4), 300 mm
mannitol, 1% n-octyl glucoside, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4
mm iodacetamide, 4 mm edta for 10 min at 4 °c followed by centrifugation. after repeating this procedure twice, proteins were eluted from
the streptavidin-agarose beads with 2 ml of the above buffer containing
6 mm biotin standing overnight at 4 °c, repeated with 2 ml for 1 h at
4 °c. final purification was achieved by preparative sds-gel electrophoresis (6% gel, 28 mm diameter, 5-cm gel length, bio-rad) at 500 v
(40 ma, 6 w) and the eluates were fractionated into 0.6-ml fractions.
ezetimibe affinity chromatography—an ezetimibe affinity matrix
was synthesized by coupling of 1-(4-aminomethyl-phenyl)-3-(3-hydroxy3-phenyl-propyl)-4-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-azetidin-2-on (16) to a hydroxy
succinimidyl-hexanoyl matrix (hi-trap column, amersham biosciences) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. n-acetyl-dglucosamine eluates from wheat germ agglutinin chromatography were
applied to the ezetimibe affinity column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min
followed by elution with 10 ml of buffer and collection of 500-␮l fractions. bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of pbs (ph 7.4), 3% triton

n-octyl glucoside (solubilization buffer) or stepwise solubilization with 0.25% n-lauroylsarcosine followed by dissolution
with solubilization buffer. for the purification of the 145-kda
ezetimibe-binding protein we developed three different protocols. (a) a classical approach by chromatographic isolation of
the radiolabeled 145 kda protein after photoaffinity labeling of
rabbit small intestinal bbmv with 3h-labeled photoreactive
ezetimibe analogues. (b) biotin-streptavidin affinity chromatography after photoaffinity labeling of rabbit small intestinal
bbmv with biotin-tagged ezetimibe photoaffinity probes (18).
(c) ligand affinity chromatography using an ezetimibe affinity
matrix. biochemical investigations revealed the glycoprotein
nature of the 145-kda protein; deglycosylation with n-glycanase shifted the molecular mass from 145 to 115 kda (fig.
4a). consequently, we investigated various lectins as matrices
for a lectin affinity chromatography. with wheat germ lectinagarose a complete retardation of the radiolabeled 145-kda
protein was achieved (fig. 5a) and with n- xxxd2683xxx 
the entire amount of the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein
could be eluted from wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (fig. 5b).
by a subsequent hydroxylapatite chromatography (fig. 5c) a
nearly complete separation of the radioactively labeled 145kda ezetimibe-binding protein from other membrane proteins
was achieved (fig. 5d). fractions were analyzed by sds-page
and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by slicing
of the gel lanes. depending on the electrophoresis system the
145-kda band retained by the streptavidin matrix was split
into a double band of 145 and 150 kda. radioactivity was found
in the bands of 145 and 205/210 kda (fig. 5e). repeated experiments revealed that the incorporation of radioactivity correlated with the intensity of the 145-kda band. the distribution
of radioactivity in the 205/210-kda band paralleled the labeling
intensity of the 145-kda band and varied between experiments,

the luminal side of the enterocyte brush border membrane
is the site of action for ezetimibe—the release of cholesterol
from luminal mixed micelles as a prerequisite for cholesterol
absorption is a protein-mediated process as shown with homogenates from hamster small intestine (24). rabbit small intestinal bbmv protein dependently catalyzed the monomerization of fluoresterol from mixed micelles (fig. 2, a and b),
whereas after preincubation of bbmv with proteinase k no
cholesterol monomerization occurred (fig. 2a). incubation of
bbmv or mixed micelles with ezetimibe (analogues) had no
influence on cholesterol monomerization (fig. 2c) excluding
inhibition of cholesterol release from mixed micelles as the
mechanism of ezetimibe action. to elucidate whether
ezetimibe blocks the entry of cholesterol into the enterocyte
brush border membrane we have measured the influence of
ezetimibe (analogues) on the transfer of [3h]cholesterol from
mixed micelles to enterocyte bbmv (25). [3h]cholesterol transfer was time-dependent (fig. 2d), but neither the simultaneous
presence nor the preincubation of bbmv or mixed micelles
with ezetimibe (analogues) had any influence on the uptake of
[3h]cholesterol by the enterocyte brush border membrane (fig.
2e). an essential structural feature for the pharmacological
activity of ezetimibe is the ␤-lactam ring structure and it may
be speculated that this structural element is responsible for its
pharmacological activity by covalent modification of the target
protein(s) similar to the antibacterial activity of the ␤-lactam
antibiotics. however, even after 24 h of incubation of bbmv
with radioactively labeled ezetimibe analogues neither covalently labeled proteins nor the carboxyl metabolite could be
detected (data not shown), making a mode of action analogue to
␤-lactam antibiotics unlikely. these findings clearly indicate
that ezetimibe blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption at the
level of the enterocyte brush border membrane or by influencing post-membrane processes.
ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed in the upper small intestine
and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestinal wall to a glucouronide as an active metabolite (28). therefore, an intracellular molecular target for ezetimibe action
cannot be ruled out a priori. consequently, we have designed
membrane-impermeable ezetimibe analogues (17) to investigate whether binding to the enterocyte brush border membrane
is sufficient for inhibition of cholesterol absorption. photoaffinity labeling of rabbit small intestinal bbmv with the 3hlabeled photoprobes c-1 or c-2 in the presence of the pharmacologically active membrane-impermeable ezetimibe-analogue
s 6130 concentration dependently inhibited labeling of the
145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein (fig. 3a). s 6504, the s
6130 analogue with an opened ␤-lactam ring, is pharmacologically inactive and did not inhibit photoaffinity labeling of the
145-kda band (fig. 3b). these investigations suggest that
ezetimibe and ezetimibe analogues exert their pharmacological activity from the luminal side of the small intestine by
binding to  xxxd3024xxx -kda integral membrane protein.
purification of the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein—purification of the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein was significantly hampered by its resistance to solubilization with nondenaturating detergents (15); after numerous failures we
finally found a protocol yielding 60 – 80% solubilization of the

with biotin, mainly one protein band of 145 kda was eluted
that was identified as apn.
because of the high affinity of ezetimibe to its molecular
target in the enterocyte brush border membrane (12), specific
ezetimibe-binding proteins should be retained by an ezetimibe
affinity column. based on the structure-activity relationships
for 2-azetidinone cholesterol absorption inhibitors (12, 16, 30)
we have synthesized an ezetimibe affinity matrix (fig. 1g).
the eluates from wheat germ agglutinin chromatography were
applied to the ezetimibe matrix and bound proteins were
eluted with 3% triton x-100 and finally purified by preparative
sds-gel electrophoresis. sequence analysis of the affinity purified 145-kda protein revealed its identity with apn; the only
other sequence identified stemmed from keratin, probably by
contamination during the purification process. depending on
the bbmv preparation the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein
purified by either of the three methods contained varying
amounts of a typical protein triplet of 42, 40, and 38 kda (fig.
7c), which were identified as ␤-actin (42 kda), ␤-actin (40 kda),
and  xxxg165xxx  (38 kda). because of the resolution limits of the
mass spectrometric methodology it cannot be excluded with
absolute certainty that the final preparation of the 145-kda
ezetimibe-binding protein contains a contaminant that may
represent the ezetimibe target; in that case, however, the
putative contaminant would have to be present in less than 1%
in the purified 145-kda protein to allow escape of detection by
electrospray-mass spectrometric sequence analysis. in none of
the experiments using the three different purification protocols
could we identify amino acid sequences belonging to the proposed candidates for an intestinal cholesterol transporter like
the scavenger receptor type bi ( xxxg2013xxx ), the abc transporters
 xxxg9xxx , abcg5, abcg8, the niemann-pick proteins npc1,
npc2, or  xxxg1583xxx  ( xxxg1583xxx ) or the

suggesting that the 205/210-kda band results from a dimerization of the 145-kda protein. the estimated amount of purified
145-kda protein was 1–3% of the material applied to the hydroxylapatite column indicating an enrichment factor 240 –
300-fold from bbmv and 4800 – 6000-fold with respect to enterocyte total protein. the radioactively labeled bands were
excised, digested with trypsin, and peptides were submitted to
sequence determination by electrospray mass spectrometry. in
the 145- and 150-kda bands, sequences for  xxxg163xxx 
(apn), aminopeptidase a (apa), and sucrase/ xxxg2070xxx  (table
i) were found; in the 205- and 210-kda bands, also predominantly apn, apa, and sucrase/ xxxg2070xxx  were found indicating a hetero- or homodimerization of the labeled protein in the
145–150-kda bands. identical results were obtained with the
c-1 and c-2-ezetimibe photoprobes. ezetimibe does not interact with the catalytic site of apn or apa because neither the
enzymatic activity of apn and apa were inhibited by
ezetimibe (analogues) nor did inhibitors of apn and apa like
 xxxd3463xxx  show any effect on photoaffinity labeling of the 145kda ezetimibe-binding protein or inhibit cholesterol absorption in vivo (data not shown).
to verify the identification of the ezetimibe-binding protein
of 145 kda in the small enterocyte brush border membrane as
apn, we have developed biotin-tagged photolabile ezetimibe
analogues c-4 and c-5 (16, 18) (fig. 1, e and f). these membrane-impermeable ezetimibe photoprobes inhibit intestinal
cholesterol absorption in vivo (18) and specifically interact with
the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein as is evident from competition labeling experiments (fig. 6a). incubation of rabbit
small intestinal bbmv with c-4 or c-5 and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation led to a concentration-dependent incorporation of the ezetimibe photoprobe predominantly into membrane proteins of 145 and 43 kda as shown in fig. 6b with
jejunal vesicles. after photoaffinity labeling of rabbit small
intestinal bbmv with c-4 or c-5 followed by solubilization,
predominantly membrane proteins of 145 kda were specifically
retained by the streptavidin beads (fig 7a, ⫹h␯), whereas no
proteins were detectable if ultraviolet irradiation was omitted
(fig. 7a, ⫺h␯). if photoaffinity labeling with c-4 was performed
in the presence of other cholesterol absorption inhibitors, the
amount of extractable 145-kda protein was reduced indicating
a direct competition between c-4 with cholesterol absorption
inhibitors for binding to the 145-kda protein (fig. 7b). in contrast, substrates of other intestinal nutrient transporters for
bile acids,  xxxd2154xxx , glucose, oligopeptides, or amino acids did
not influence the amount of extractable 145-kda protein (data
not shown). labeling experiments with cell membranes from
different organs revealed that only by labeling of bbmv from
rabbit small intestine could  xxxd3024xxx -kda protein be extracted,
whereas after labeling of membranes from stomach, cecum,
colon, rectum, kidney, liver, or fat tissue no 145-kda protein
was retarded by streptavidin beads (fig. 7b). final purification
was achieved by preparative sds-electrophoresis leading to a
complete separation of the 145- and 150-kda proteins (fig. 7c).
sequence analysis of the bands eluted from the preparative
sds gels revealed the identity of the 145-kda band with apn,
whereas the upper band (150 kda) was a mixture of apn, apa,
and sucrase/ xxxg2070xxx  (table ii); no other proteins could be
identified in these fractions. to avoid retention of proteins by
unspecific binding to the matrix or of protein complexes by
protein-protein interactions, bbmv-membrane proteins were,
subsequently to photoaffinity labeling with c-4, solubilized
with 1% sds in pbs or 0.25% n-lauroylsarcosine in pbs followed by dilution with solubilization buffer to a concentration
of sds or n-lauroylsarcosine of less than 0.1% and following
application to the streptavidin beads. under these conditions

fig. 6. effect of the biotin-tagged photolabile cholesterol absorption inhibitors on photoaffinity labeling of the 145-kda
ezetimibe-binding protein. a, rabbit ileal bbmv (150 ␮g of protein
each) were incubated for 30 min at 20 °c in the dark with 66 nm (0.3
␮ci) [3h]c-1 in the absence or presence of 66 or 133 ␮m of the biotintagged photolabile cholesterol absorption inhibitor c-4 followed by
sds-page and detection of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting after slicing of the gels into 2-mm pieces. b, rabbit jejunal bbmv (10
␮g of protein) were incubated for 60 min with 0, 1, 3, or 10 ␮m c-5
followed by irradiation at 254 nm for 30 s (⫹h␯) or avoidance of light
(⫺h␯). after washing, membrane proteins were separated by sdspage and incorporation of the ezetimibe photoprobe was visualized
with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase.

intestinal cholesterol absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum and the jejunum with little or no contribution of the
ileum (31–33). however, a careful evaluation of the literature
clearly reveals that the entire small intestine has the capability
to absorb cholesterol (33–36). during gastrointestinal passage
the concentration of micellar cholesterol decreases proximal to
distal because of the absorption of cholesterol and  xxxd2154xxx  in
the upper and mid-small intestine and of bile acids in the
ileum. as a result, cholesterol is physiologically more efficiently
absorbed in the upper small intestine, but the ileum has as well
the capability to absorb cholesterol: based on tissue weight or
on the length of intestinal segments, the transport capacities
for cholesterol were similar in jejunum and ileum (35). photoaffinity labeling of bbmv from rabbit ileum and rabbit jejunum with ezetimibe photoprobes yielded similar labeling patterns with a slightly higher labeling in the ileum as we have
reported earlier (12). for a more precise analysis we have
prepared bbmv from 8 segments of rabbit small intestine,
from duodenum to ileum, and analyzed the distribution of apn
and other brush border enzymes and of the 145-kda ezetimibebinding protein along the gastrocolic axis. apn exerted an
increase in the specific enzymatic activity (fig. 8a) and protein
expression (fig. 8b) from duodenum to ileum; the peptidases
apa and dipeptidylpeptidase iv showed a similar or even
steeper gradient, whereas sucrase/ xxxg2070xxx  and ␥-glutamyltransferase did not show a concentration gradient along the
gastrocolic axis. photoaffinity labeling of bbmv from these
intestinal segments with radiolabeled ezetimibe analogues illustrate that the intensity of labeling of the 145-kda ezetimibe
increased from duodenum to ileum concomitantly with apn
(fig. 8c). after photoaffinity labeling with the biotin-ezetimibe
probes the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein could be extracted from solubilized membrane proteins of all 8 intestinal
segments with varying amounts of a 43-kda protein (fig. 9, a
and b); immunostaining with actin antibodies and sequencing
revealed its identity with actin (fig. 9c). recently, it was suggested that a heteromeric protein complex of  xxxg165xxx  and
 xxxg346xxx  serves as the molecular target for ezetimibe in the
cytosol of enterocytes from zebrafish and mouse (37). in the
protein preparations extracted with streptavidin beads from
solubilized bbmv of the 8 small intestinal segments after
photoaffinity labeling with the biotin-ezetimibe probe c-5 (fig.
9a)  xxxg165xxx  could be detected as a 36-kda band with antiannexin ii antibodies (fig. 9d). however, no significant labeling of 36- (for  xxxg165xxx ) or 21-kda bands (for caveolin1) was
observable after photoaffinity labeling with the biotinezetimibe probes (fig. 9b) or with radiolabeled ezetimibe
probes c1 or c2 (data not shown), making a direct interaction
of ezetimibe with an  xxxg165xxx - xxxg346xxx  complex as its mode
of action unlikely.
apn/ xxxg163xxx  is expressed in the plasma membrane of many
different cell types in different organs (38). photoaffinity labeling of bbmv isolated from stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, or kidney resulted only with bbmv from the small
intestine in a significant labeling of the 145-kda ezetimibebinding protein (15) despite the presence of apn-like enzymatic activity in all membrane preparations. fig. 10a reveals
the presence of apn-protein in bbmv of rabbit jejunum and
kidney but not in stomach or colon transversum. whereas a
prominent labeling of the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein
occurred in bbmv from the small intestine (figs. 6b and 9b),
no labeling of the 145-kda protein occurred in bbmv from
stomach or colon transversum with only a faint labeling in
renal bbmv (fig. 10b). the labeling of the 145-kda ezetimibebinding protein in plasma membranes from different cell types
obviously correlates with the presence of apn-protein as de-

discussion

whereas the mechanisms and pathways of cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism to bile acids and steroid hormones are well
known, the molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal cholesterol absorption still lie in the dark. the existence of specific
cholesterol absorption inhibitors with profound structure-activity
relationships (4, 5) strongly argues for the involvement of specific
proteins in the cholesterol absorption process. the assumption of
a single cholesterol transporter (48, 49), however, is a too simplified view from a number of observations.
(a) cholesterol from mixed micelles is transferred to the
enterocyte brush border and is moved to detergent-resistant
microdomains from which subsequently transport to the endoplasmic reticulum occurs (11).
(b) cholesterol absorption probably occurs by endocytotic

processes as was visualized with the fluorescent cholesterol
analogue fluoresterol (50). the scavenger receptor  xxxg2013xxx  is in
the fasting state predominantly localized in the microvillar
membrane and in apical invaginations between adjacent microvilli as well as in a subapical compartment and small cytoplasmic lipid droplets. upon exposure of mucosal explants from
pigs to a mixture of corn oil, cholesterol, bile, and pancreatin,
the number of coated pits between adjacent microvilli strongly
increased, being immunoreactive for  xxxg2013xxx  followed by internalization of  xxxg2013xxx  with a huge increase of  xxxg2013xxx  accumulation
in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (39).
(c) cholesterol absorption inhibitors like ezetimibe and cholesterol or phytosterols bind to different membrane proteins of
the enterocyte brush border membrane not showing any mutual interaction and competition to common binding sites (12,
13, 15). consequently, a genomic approach with the assumption of a sterol-binding domain will fail to identify the molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors. during preparation of this manuscript altmann et al. (49) reported the
identification of the  xxxg1583xxx  as an essential protein being
involved in the ezetimibe-sensitive cholesterol absorption
pathway;  xxxg1583xxx , however, was neither able to bind
ezetimibe (analogues) nor could cholesterol transport be reconstituted by overexpression of  xxxg1583xxx  in non-enterocyte cells
(49) making its role as the primary molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors like ezetimibe unlikely.
when we discovered that ezetimibe and cholesterol absorption inhibitors specifically bind to  xxxd3024xxx -kda integral membrane protein of the enterocyte brush border membrane, we
screened protein data bases for membrane proteins in the
molecular range of 130 –160 kda and considered the niemannpick c1 protein as a putative candidate for the ezetimibe
target. an identity of the ezetimibe-binding protein with npc1
and possibly  xxxg1583xxx  is unlikely from the following findings: (i)
npc1 is transporting  xxxd2154xxx  and the cationic dye acriflavin
(51); upon photoaffinity labeling with ezetimibe photoprobes
we never observed an inhibition of the labeling of the 145-kda
protein by the presence of  xxxd2154xxx  or acriflavin (data not
shown). (ii) photoaffinity labeling of the 145-kda ezetimibebinding protein is not inhibited by cholesterol and phytosterols
and the 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein is not labeled by
photolabile cholesterol (15). in contrast, npc-1 and  xxxg1583xxx 
contain a sterol-sensing domain and are labeled by a photoactivable cholesterol analogue if the sterol sensing domain is
intact (52). (iii)  xxxg1583xxx  is highly glycosylated migrating with
an apparent molecular mass of 165 kda with a shift to 140 kda
upon deglycosylation. in contrast, the ezetimibe-binding protein from the enterocyte brush border membrane migrates at
145 kda and shifts to 115 kda after deglycosylation. (iv) we
never obtained sequence fragments belonging to npc1 or
 xxxg1583xxx  when analyzing fractions and proteins from brush
border membranes covalently cross-linked to ezetimibe analogues or retained by an ezetimibe affinity column.
we could identify the luminal side of the enterocyte brush
border membrane as the site for pharmacological activity of

protein can be demonstrated.

and on the binding of the wm-47 mab to apn/ xxxg163xxx  in caco-2
cells—confluent caco-2 cells cultivated for a further 11 to 20
days exert partial sensitivity of cholesterol uptake to
ezetimibe. fig. 11 shows that the uptake of [3h]cholesterol
from mixed micelles was partially inhibited by preincubation of
the cells with 150 ␮m ezetimibe or the nonabsorbable
ezetimibe analogue s 6130.
because of the surprising finding that apn is a specific
target protein for ezetimibe in the brush border membrane of
small intestinal enterocytes and because apn is involved in
endocytosis of membrane domains (39 – 41) and internalization
of certain viruses (42– 47), we investigated whether ezetimibe
has an influence on the binding properties of the wm-47 mab
to apn/ xxxg163xxx  on caco-2 cells. staining of confluent caco-2
cells with fitc-conjugated wm-47 mab (specific monoclonal
antibody against human  xxxg163xxx ) resulted in a bright fluorescence that was more intense at the cell surfaces in a granular
pattern (fig. 12a). in addition, a discrete cytoplasmic fluorescence staining was also visible, whereas nuclei were clearly free
of immunofluorescence (fig. 12, a and c). incubation of caco-2
cells with ezetimibe prior to staining with wm-47 mab nearly
completely abolished the immunofluorescent staining of the
cell surface and only a weak punctual surface staining is left
(fig. 12b). in contrast, however, if the cells were preincubated
with wm-47 mab first, subsequent treatment with ezetimibe
did not significantly change the immunofluorescence staining
of apn/ xxxg163xxx  and the staining pattern reflecting the gross
cellular distribution of apn was very similar to untreated
caco-2 cells (fig. 12d). this finding makes a direct competition between ezetimibe and the apn antibodies unlikely. on
the other hand, ezetimibe may induce a conformational change
on apn/ xxxg163xxx  that the wm-47 mab cannot recognize its binding site on the ezetimibe-pretreated apn/ xxxg163xxx .

ited by ezetimibe (analogues). ezetimibe and its analogues
exert their pharmacological activity by specific binding from
the intestinal lumen to  xxxd3024xxx -kda membrane protein in the
enterocyte brush border membrane. binding of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to this 145-kda ezetimibe-binding protein
as determined by differential photoaffinity labeling studies
revealed identical structure-activity relationships as for in vivo
inhibition of cholesterol absorption (12, 13). independently on
the methodology used for purification, sequence analysis consistently revealed to our surprise the identity of the 145-kda
ezetimibe-binding protein with the membrane-bound metalloprotease apn ((alanyl)aminopeptidase; leukemia antigen
 xxxg163xxx ). apn is an exopeptidase anchored to the cell membrane
by a transmembrane helical region near the n terminus with
only a small region (8 –10 amino acids) of the n terminus
protruding into the cytoplasm (53). apn is widely distributed
with a preferential localization in the brush border membrane
of small intestinal enterocytes, kidney, liver, and placental
cells as well as in the plasma membrane of monocytes, basophiles, eosinophiles, and neutrophiles (38). independently from
its enzymatic activity, apn shows a number of different functions from insects to mammals: (a) apn is the high affinity
receptor for bacillus thuringiensis cry1aa toxin in the midgut
of many insect species (54) mediating insecticidal specificity by
opening cation selective ion channels causing cell lysis and

that cholesterol absorption inhibitors interfere with the cellular

tosis of tgev (47). the tgev virus particle contains numerous apn receptor sites and during binding of tgev to the cell
membrane via apn further apn molecules are recruited leading to a local high density of apn molecules beneath the virus
particle. the binding site for tgev was localized outside the
catalytic site to the c-terminal part of apn (47). the formation
of the apn-tgev complexes in the plasma membrane increases the endocytosis rate as indicated by the increase in the
number of coated pits and apical vesicles. this clustering of
apn molecules is independent on the cytoplasmic n-terminal
tail and the virus particles probably cross-link the apn molecules thereby inducing endocytosis similar to antibody-mediated endocytosis. the internalized apn-tgev complexes are
then transported to endosomes where finally the tgev membrane fusion and penetration occurs dependent on an acidic
compartment. cross-linking of apn molecules evenly distributed on the cell surface of human fibroblasts and labeled with
 xxxg163xxx  antibodies with a secondary antibody led to a sequestration of apn to  xxxg346xxx -positive patches (57). during this
redistribution, the cross-linked apn molecules showed a linear
distribution along longitudinal lines, probably being actin
stress fibers prior to sequestration to  xxxg346xxx -positive
patches, which suggests that the cross-linking of apn induces
binding to actin filaments. coronovirus 229e, being a specific
ligand for apn (42), induced a similar redistribution as induced by the secondary antibody to apn suggesting that the
same mechanism is activated by binding to apn. cholesterol
depletion of membranes did not change binding of the viruses
to the cell surface but led to an inhibition of sequestration to
 xxxg346xxx -positive patches and internalization. the findings
that on the one hand various viruses like coronaviruses, sars,
or cytomegaloviruses use apn as the specific receptor for body
internalization and that on the other hand apn is the molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors suggest that
cholesterol absorption inhibitors like ezetimibe and ezetimibe
analogues (16 –18) or sterol glycosides may be effective to prevent and treat infections by viruses using apn as receptor.
changes in the cellular localization of apn between the
plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (the deep
apical tubules) also occur in enterocytes dependent on their cholesterol availability. deep apical tubules are a novel surfacecontaining structure in the terminal web region of the brush
border functioning as a hub in membrane trafficking of the brush
border, thereby connecting the apical surface to the network of
intracellular trafficking routes, including the transcytotic pathway (40, 41). apn is present in these deep apical tubules, which
are assumed to act as an apical membrane reservoir allowing the
enterocyte to adjust rapidly to the microvillar length and thus
absorption capacity. the finding that the deep apical tubules
disappear upon cholesterol depletion by methyl-␤-cyclodextrin
may indicate that these compartments act as putative cholesterol
reservoirs during lipid absorption (40, 41). because of the involvement of apn in receptor-mediated endocytosis and the dynamics of the deep apical tubule compartment we have investigated the influence of ezetimibe (i) on cholesterol uptake and (ii)
on binding of the wm-47 mab on  xxxg163xxx  in confluent caco-2 cells.
the uptake of cholesterol uptake by caco-2 cells could partially
be inhibited by ezetimibe and the nonabsorbable ezetimibe analogue s 6130, indicating that cultivated caco-2 cells express to
some extent the ezetimibe-sensitive pathway of cholesterol absorption that is in differentiated small intestinal enterocytes
responsible for more than 80% of cholesterol absorption (50). the
intense fluorescence staining of  xxxg163xxx  on caco-2 cells shown
with fitc-conjugated wm-47 mab was nearly completely diminished when the cells were treated with ezetimibe prior to
apn staining. if ezetimibe was applied after binding of the
