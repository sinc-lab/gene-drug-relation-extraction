abstract
lindane is widely used as an insecticide and scabicide in mammals. high doses in chronic
exposures caused hyperexcitability and convulsions and impaired motor activity involving
gaba-ergic mechanism. to investigate the role of gaba/benzodiazepine mechanism in the
neurotoxicity of low doses of linahe, rats were aahinistered 2, 3, or 5 mg&g orallyfor 90 &vs
and behavioural, electrophysiologcal, and neurochemical studies were conducted. the animals
exposed to lindane exhibited increased geotaxis and decreased spontaneous drug-induced
locomotor activity (whichfurther potentiated by  xxxd2908xxx  and increased after leptazol).
the eeg of the treated rats showed high voltage slow-wave activity (hvsa) patterns with
occasional spindles (9-10 hz-amplitude of 100 uv). a significant increase @ 0.01) in gaba
levels in cerebellum and significant increase in benzodiazepine receptors in cerebellar
membrane measured by thlflunitrazepam binding were observed in the animals exposed to 3
and 5 mg lindane. the stuq suggests that low dose chronic exposure of lindane causes
neurobehavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiologrcal efects involving gaba-ergic
mechanism(s) .

mammals, is reported to cause hyper-excitability and convulsions (stein, et al 1981), impairment

of motor activity (tussel, et al 1987a), and enhancement of kindling seizures (joy, et a1 1982;
star, et a1 1986). lindane exposure (30 mgkg) significantly increases the concentration of
gaba in brain at onset of convulsions (cattabeni et al 1983; sunol et a1 1989).

butylbicyclophosphorothionate(tbps) binding (abalis et a1 1985, matsumura and ghiasuddin
1983) in rat brain lindane at doses 30 mgkg has been reported to cause significant inhibition

on the binding of 3h gaba and 'h flunitrazepam sola et al 1993 have reported that a single
high dose of lindane (30 m a g ) significantly affects the number of binding sites of 'h
muscirnol, 'h-flunitrazepam, and 35s tbps specific ligand for gaba, benzodiazepine and
picrotoxinin binding sites respectively in cerebellar region, showing the involvement of
gabnbenzodiazepine receptor moiety in lindane induced neurotoxicity at higher doses
in the present study, an attempt has been made to explore the role of gababz mechanisms in

behavioural, neurochemical and electrophysiological effects induced by chronic exposure of low
doses ( 2 , 3 or 5 m a g ) lindane dissolved in peanut oil (1 ml/kg) intraperitoneally (lindane was
obtained from sigma chemicals,  xxxd2908xxx  fiom abbott and leptazol from ciba giegy) in
rats the effect of a gaba agonist and antagonist has also been studied to confirm the role of
gaba receptor moiety in lindane-exposed animals

materials and methods
adult male albino rats weighing 175*10 gm obtained fiom itrc breeding colony, maintained

on pellet diet, and were randomly divided into four groups of 24 rats each. all the four groups
(control, 2 rng, 3 mg and 5 mg/kg lindane i.p ) were treated for 90 days after termination of 90
days dosing period, all the groups were challenged by a single injection of drug (d) i e.
 xxxd2908xxx  (25 mg/kg i.p.) or leptazol (2 mg/kg s.c.). behavioural studies were then
conducted at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours intervals

negative geotaxis was measured using a wire mesh screen tilted at 70" angle. each rat was
placed in head-down position midway on the screen and time to re-orient to a head-up position
was recorded.

each animal was given three trials and the average response time of the

successfbl trials was used as time score (anger 1984). spontaneous and drug induced locomotor
activity of six animals randomly selected from each group was recorded by photoactometer for 5
mtdrat. prior to the treatment, test session animals were habituated for successive two trials of 5
mts. each (ernoff et a1 1979). general locomotor activity of individual rats were measured for 5
mts. in a circular photoactometer. activity was recorded as total photocell counts for each 5 mts.
period for three trials (sobotka et a1 1980).
six rats from each group were used for eeg recording following the methods of h a n d et al
1980. rats were anaesthetised and the recording electrodes were implanted stereotaxically over
the frontal cortex using coordinates 8.5 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral to midline of the skull

(groot 1959). the exposed skin area was covered by dental acrylin. recordings were made in
control and lindane treated animals challenged with the challenge drugs 3 days after the
implantation using a 7 grass polygraph with a flexible shielded cable at a speed 25 m d s e c and
sensitivity caliberated at 50 uv/cm.
crude synaptic membranes were prepared following the method of agrawal, et a1 1981). the
cerebellum was dissected out from control and the lindane (5 mg) exposed animals and
homogenized in 19 vol. of 0.32 m sucrose and centrifiged at 50,000 x g for 10 min. the pellet
thus obtained was washed three times in deionized water and centrihged. the pellet was then
suspended in 40 mm tris-hc1 buffer ph 7.4 at a concentration equivalent to 50 mg/ml.
3h-flunitrazepam binding was done following the method of seth, et al 1981. in brief, 1 ml
incubation mixture containing 100 ul of membrane preparation equivalent to 250 ug protein and
10 ul of 0.7 nm 3h-flunitrazepam (sp. activity 84 ci/nmol. amersham international u.k.) with
and without 1 um unlabelled diazepam were added in 40 mm tris hci buffer ph 7.4 the
mixture was incubated at 4°c for 30 min. and filtered through gf/c glass fibre filters. the
filters were washed two times with 5 ml cold  xxxd3449xxx , dried, and counted in b scintillation
counter.

specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding obtained in

presence of 1 um diazepam from total binding. the results are calculated and expressed as p
moles boundmg protein. the protein was determined following the method of lowry et a1
1951

flunitrazepam following the methods of scatchard (1949).
brain homogenate was mixed with chilled  xxxd102xxx  and then centrifuged at 160008 at
0°c. gaba was isolated by mixing it with methanol chloroform water solution, separated the

aqueous layer containing gaba and chromatographed (iverson, et al 1971).
the mean counts between dose levels and hours were analyzed using two ways anova after
ascertaining homogenicity of variance between dose level for each hour separately. if the overall
f ratio was found to be significant, analysis was done using dunett's test (zar 1984).

results
neurobehavioral studies

tremors of grade 2 were observed in animals exposed to 3 and 5 mgkg of lindane, only when
challenged with leptazol. tremors were more marked over the head and neck region and also on
the fore paws (grade 2 tremors).
rats exposed to 2,3, and 5 mgkg of lindane for 90 days exhibited a significant increase

(p <0.05, p <0.01) in negative geotaxis when challenged with leptazol (2 mgkg

s.c.

gaba

antagonist). a significant blockade (in 5 mgkg lindane group p <0.05) in negative geotaxis was
observed when challenged with  xxxd2908xxx  25 mgkg (gaba agonist) when compared with
the vehicle and  xxxd2908xxx  treated control groups (fig. 1 & 2).
a significant decrease (p <0.05) in spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in the animals
exposed to 2 , 3 and 5 mgkg of lindane. this decrease in motor activity is further potentiated
(p <0.01) in 2 and 3 mgkg group given  xxxd2908xxx  (25 mgkg). a significant increase in
motor activity (p <0.05, p <0.01) was observed in 3 and 5 mgkg lindane group when challenged
with leptazol ( 2 mgkg s.c.) (fig. 3 & 4). gaba levels in the cerebellar region exhibited a
significant increase in animals exposed to 3 and 5 mgkg of lindane after 90 days exposure (fig.
5). no significant effect was observed at 2 mgkg dose.

the 'h-flunitrazepam binding showed a significant increase (p <0.05) in lindane (5 mg/kg)
treated rats when compared to vehicle treated controls. the increase in binding was due to effect

the animals exposed to 3 mgkg dose (fig. 6).

eeg recordings showed high voltage slow wave activity pattern with occasional spindles (9-10

hz) at amplitude of 100 uv which was more pronounced at higher dose of lindane. whereas,
high voltage spike pattern was recorded after leptazol administration. a sleep pattern was seen
after  xxxd2908xxx  administration (figs. 7, 8 and 9).
discussion
several investigators have reported that lindane causes hyperexcitability, tremor and convulsions
at higher doses but the mechanism of its cns actions following low dose long-term exposure has
not been hlly established.

involvement of gaba receptor ionophore complex has been

demonstrated as primary target for lindane action (fisherman & gainutsos 1988 62 obata et al
1988). in most of these studies high doses of iindane have been used for toxicity study.

consistant with the previous observations, the present study show the involvement of gaba

changes both in affinity (kd) as well as maximum number of binding sites (bmax).
lindane is believed to exert its excitatory efforts by non-competitive binding with picrotoxinin, a
subunit of gaba complex blocking the chloride ion channel (cole & casida 1986, leoreus et
al 1990) without significantly affecting other subunits of the complex. recently, sola et al 1993
demonstrated involvement of other subunits of gaba ionophore through the autoradiography
showing an upregulation of 'h-flunitrazepam, 35s-tbpsand 3h-muscimol binding under in vivo
conditions at a high dose (40 mg/kg). our observation on upregulation of gaba receptor
complex shown by 3h-flunitrazepam binding as a consequence of low dose of lindane exposure
is in close agreement to the earlier in vivo reports of high dose exposure of lindane (cattabeni et
a1 1983) earlier studies have shown that high doses of lindane causes significant increase in
gaba level in cortical and cerebellar regions (cattabeni, et al 1983).
the involvement of gaba receptor in lindane induced neurotoxicity is fbrther confirmed by
neurobehavioral studies. the increase in negative geotaxis and spontaneous motor activity in
lindane (3 & 5 mgikg) treated animals was potentiated by leptozol, a gaba antagonist and
blocked by  xxxd2908xxx  a gaba agonist. this further confirms the involvement of gaba
receptor complex in lindane toxicity.
our studies show that lindane induced alteration in gaba receptor activity and influenced the
neuronal activity as the high voltage, slow wave activity pattern with occasional spindles
observed in animals treated with 5 mg/kg for 90 days was hrther potentiated by leptazol
challenge

the increase in neuronal functional activity have been earlier reported in lindane-

exposed animals (sanfeliu et al 1989, rivera et a1 1990, tusell et a1 1987b) but these studies
have been done at higher doses

pretreatment with gaba receptor agonist drugs

 xxxd2908xxx  produced a significant protective effect against convulsions, exploratory
behaviour and spontaneous locomotor activity as well as in neuronal firing rate measured by

eeg in lindane-exposed animals challenged by leptazol investigators (ulloque et a1 1986,
yunger et a1 1984) have shown that barbiturate exerts its cns inhibitory effect by facilitating
gaba mediated neurotransmission through a gab a ionophore complex where as antagonist
leptazol exhibit excitatory effect on neurobehavioral and electrophysiological modulation
through the same mechanism (sunol et a1 1989)

gaba receptor complex

the neurochemical, neurobehavioral and electrophysiological studies suggest that low doses of
lindane which does not produce visible convulsions and tremor still exert its cns effect through
