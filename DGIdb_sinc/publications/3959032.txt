a series of ureides active against grand mal epilepsy have been studied by using classical potential energy calculations.
the series includes phenyl ethyl and diphenyl derivatives of hydantoins, succinimides, glutarimides,oxazolidine2,4-diones,pyrimidine-2,6-diones,barbituric acids, and  xxxd2897xxx . a thorough examination of the conformational
possibilities did not reveal an exclusive conformation that could account for their activity. however, comparisons
with diazepam and other benzodiazepines known to have the ability to competitively bind with drugs such as
 xxxd2924xxx  at some sites show that there is a distinct conformational preference that may well account for
their activity against grand mal epilepsy. the conformational studies led to the proposal of a general model for
anticonvulsant activity comprisingtwo aromatic rings or their equivalent in a favored orientation and a third region,
usually a cyclic ureide, comprising a number of hydrogen-bond-formingfunctional groups. the specific placement
of hydrogen-bondinggroups in this region appears to be of less importance than the correct conformationalarrangement
of the hydrophobic elements.

introduction
drugs clinically active against tonic-clonic (grand mal)
epilepsy include phenytoin,  xxxd2908xxx , primidone,
clonazepam, diazepam,  xxxd3485xxx , acetazolamide, and
some 7- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)
some
of these drugs (such as the little used acetazolamide, which
is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor2) have specific modes of
action, but others have not yet been linked with a specific
binding site within the brain. as shown in figure 1,
however, those derived from hydantoins, oxazolidinediones,
succinimides, and glutarimides do have important structural similarities. the most common structural elements
appear t o be a nitrogen heteroatomic system, usually a
cyclic imide, and at least one carbonyl group. compounds
active against maximal electroshock (mes), the experimental model used for tonic-clonic epilepsy, also have a t
least one phenyl group and either another phenyl ring or
an alkyl substituent attached to the heteroatomic system.
dialkyl-substituted cyclic ureides show activity2 against
absence seizures.
in addition to various structural elements, several
physicochemical properties, including molecular dipole
moment and partition coefficient, have been associated
with anticonvulsant a c t i ~ n ,but
~ - ~these are now thought
to be primarily related t o the ability of the drug to pass
through the blood-brain barrier2 in order to reach the site
of action. hydrogen bonding has been shown by theoretica17and experimental8 studies to be necessary for activity, but there does not appear to be any correlation
between the strength of hydrogen bonding and the type
or extent of anticonvulsant a ~ t i o n ,nor

tial surface, usually associated with the imide oxygens of
 xxxd2924xxx , were common to most of the drugs
studied, indicating a major role for both these hydrogenbond acceptors in binding. subsequent structural modifications to  xxxd2924xxx 'o and monophenylhydantoin" derivatives, however, revealed that replacing
either of these oxygens with a methylene group results in
a relatively slight reduction in anticonvulsant activity
against mes. these and other structure-activity relationship data2 make it difficult to assign a major role in
anticonvulsant activity to any specific hydrogen-bonding
group.

figure 1. representative anticonvulsant drugs showing activity
against electroshock seizures: (i)  xxxd2908xxx , (11) phenytoin,
(111) diazepam, (iv)pheneturide. compounds showing this type
of anticonvulsant activity are likely to have clinical use in the
treatment of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy.

that they do have sufficient structural similarity to bind
at the same site in some instances. the sure identification
of which binding sites are involved with anticonvulsant
activity is difficult, especially as most anticonvulsant drugs
interact with more than one receptor. although saturatable binding sites have been found for several antiepileptic
drugs, the binding levels a t those sites do not always
correlate well with the drug concentrations in the brain
necessary for therapeutic action;2 a significant proportion
of the total drug concentration is usually bound to nonspecific membrane and soluble protein components, with
the free concentration available for receptor binding being
low. as all the antiepileptic drugs tested so far have
relatively high levels of apparently nonspecific binding, this
may conceivably include binding a t the actual active site.
it thus remains possible, but not proven, that the drugs
shown in figure 1have a common receptor site for their
antiepileptic activity. the fact that many of these compounds are structurally very similar tends to support this
possibility.
stereoisomeric dataz7also provide support for the existence of structurally specific receptors. nirvanol,
 xxxd2568xxx ,  xxxd2214xxx , and pheneturide all show small but
significant stereoisomeric differences in activity,2g34though
data concerning enantiomeric activity against various test
models for epilepsy are scarce. the largest enantiomeric
difference against mes is shown by nirvanol, with the
more potent (-) isomer being assigned the r configuration35736by chemical correlation with n-(chloroacety1)l. h. easson and e. stedman, biochem. j., 27,1257 (1933).

isovaline, for which the absolute configuration has been
determined by x-ray ~rystallography.~~
interestingly, the
(+) isomer is more active against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures, the test used for antiabsence-seizure activity. for  xxxd2568xxx , of which nirvanol is the nl-demethylated metabolite, the 5’-(+)isomer is more active against
mes.32p37 these results appear to be conflicting and
should be retested by more accurate and modern methods.
tests on the activities of enantiomers of other anticonvulsant cyclic ureides are on sedative, hypnotic, and related
proper tie^.^^ however, it has been shown that these
pharmacological actions are separable from the anticonvulsant action shown by these drugs, so that such enantiomeric differences as are seen for these properties do not
necessarily give an accurate idea of which is the more active
anticonvulsant enantiomer.
pfeiffer’s g e n e r a l i ~ a t i o non
~ ~the relationship between
the potency and pharmacological effects of enantiomers
binding a t structurally specific receptors states that the
more potent the drug, the greater the stereoisomeric difference. for anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use the differences between the enantiomers are not large. this
implies that the specificity of the more active isomers for
the target receptor is not as great as it might be and that
more potent and specific anticonvulsant drugs could
therefore be developed. on the other hand, the fact that
the few enantiomeric activity differences available for
anticonvulsants are of the order expected from pfeiffer’s
generalization for drugs of their potency reinforces the view
that these anticonvulsants are binding at stereospecific
receptors.32
provided the right chemical groups are present in the
correct spatial configuration for binding, molecular conformation seems to be the most likely factor influencing
the activity of these compounds. camerman and camerman39-47have suggested, on the basis of x-ray crystallographic studies, that molecular conformation is a key
factor in the therapeutic activity of a number of anticonvulsant drugs although they are not closely related chemically. this approach is promising but restricted, as the
crystal structure gives only one low-energy conformation
of each molecule, although several alternate conformations
of as low or even lower energy may exist in solution.
theoretical calculations have therefore been carried out
to identify all low-energy conformations that could conceivably be involved in binding at the receptor. these
conformations are then compared with those found in the

antiomer. in phenylethylbarbitone and primidone, however, the mirror image of the first type of conformation
is identical with that of the second type, due to the symmetry of the heterocyclic ring.
detailed conformational energy maps for each of the

clearly that the major low-energy conformations for phenyl

phenyl) = 135 f 20' [for its ethyl group rotamer 71(ethyl) = 180 f 10' and phenyl) = 135 f 20'1 as well
as degenerate conformations corresponding to 180' rotation of the phenyl ring, ie, of r2. a similar investigation
of all the high-energy areas (>50 kcal mol-' above the
global minimum) also indicated which conformations were
the least likely to be involved in the initial binding of these
compounds to the active site. however, a combination of
both these techniques did not uniquely determine which
of the low-energy conformations was the most likely to be
the active conformation.
in the crystal structures of these compounds, all the
heterocyclic rings were nonplanar, but except for phenobarbital, primidone, and the glutarimides, the deviations
from planarity were very slight. calculations and superimpositions were therefore done assuming a planar ring
for the hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and succinimides,
while nonplanar heterocyclic ring systems with both axial
and equatorial orientations of the phenyl ring were considered for phenylethylglutarimide, primidone, and phenobarbital. additional calculations were made assuming
a planar heterocyclic ring for phenobarbital and diphenylbarbitone, since the pyrimidinetrione ring is nearly
planar in the majority of barbiturate~~l
and the energy
barriers to ring buckling are slight. although the minimum
energy conformations were very similar, if not identical,
for these minor ring deformations such differences need
to be kept in mind when building receptor points. the
minimum energy conformations for primidone with both
phenyl axial and phenyl equatorial are shown in figure
5 . for the phenyl group axial form of primidone, there
are no low-energy conformers with ethyl) at -180°, but
there is another low-energy conformation, with the plane
of the axial phenyl ring running across the  xxxd3470xxx 
ring from carbonyl group to carbonyl group. in all of those
cases where there is a nonplanar heterocyclic ring, the
derivative with the phenyl ring axial was found to be of

results and discussion
the compounds studied are shown in table i. the
values of the torsion angles giving minimum energy conformations are shown in table 11.
phenylethyl derivatives. examination of lowest energy conformations of the phenyl ethyl substituted heterocycles found from the energy calculations showed two
main types of conformations. the first type has the phenyl
group oriented toward the adjacent carbonyl group. here,
the torsion angle of the phenyl ring is in the range of
30-90°, with the majority of torsion angles lying between
35 and 50'. the second type has the plane of the phenyl
ring oriented toward the other side of the heterocyclicring,
where most of the phenyl ring torsion angles are in the
range 110-135'. the ethyl group shows two orientations:
(a) at 35-60'; (b) at 165-180' (essentially perpendicular
to the ureide ring). these conformations are depicted in
figure 3, using phenylethylhydantoin as an example. a
typical conformational energy map, also for phenylethylhydantoin, is shown in figure 4. for each conformation
of each of these compounds there is also a mirror image
conformation of the same energy obtained from the en(92) crystal structures obtained from the cambridge crystallographic data base, j. f. blount [personal communication]

show two types of conformation, the types being assigned
by comparison of the phenyl torsion angles with those of
the analogous phenyl ethyl derivatives. however, this

benzodiazepine derivatives. since neither the phenyl
ethyl nor diphenyl derivatives establishes a unique anticonvulsant conformation, we turned t o the benzodiazepines, which also show activity against mes and have
a somewhat more restricted geometry. calculations based
on functional group contributions indicate that diazepam
provides an excellent match to the benzodiazepine receptor," though its anticonvulsant and anxiolytic actions may

phenyl ring on c5 and the methyl group on n1 are shown
in figure 8. ring inversion gives a mirror image conformation of the same energy. crystal structures of henzodiazepines show only boat conformations of the diazepine ring, all remarkably similar in geometry, even when
there is more than one molecule in the unit cell. in benzodiazepines that are not enantiomeric at c3, two mirror
image boat forms may exist in the crystal, while in solution
these two boat forms readily interconvert. however, in
bendiazpines substituted at c3, only the boat forms with
the substituent pseudoequatorial are found, both in the
solid state and in solution. benzodiazepines enantiomeric

this energy map is not strictly comparahle with those of the cyclic

respect to another off the same carbon. in order to demonstrate
this effect for diazepam, a dotted line has been drawn across the
conformational energy map that indicates the range of torsion
angles for c10-c11-c5-c1' (see figure 2 for the torsion angle
definition) found in the crystal structures of diazepines.

structure of (s)-1,3-dimethyl-5-(2'-fluorophenyl)-7-nitro1,3-dihydro-2h-1,4-henzodiazepin-2-one
(ro 11-6896)
show that the boat form with the methyl group axial is of
much higher energy than the form with the methyl group
equatorial. the energy difference between the energy
minima of the two forms is still significant in mindo/3
calculations with fully optimized geometries, indicating
that the boat conformation with the methyl group pseudoequatorial is the active form. this is the same conformation as that proposed by blount et a1.9i based on the
structural similarity between ro 11-6896 and the potent
and almost rigid anthramycin-like benzodiazepine ro
14-5975. this geometry thus provides a basis for determining the most likely conformation for activity of the
other anticonvulsants.
mindo/3 calculations on ro 11-6896 with the 3methyl group equatorial also gave the same torsion angle
for the 5-phenyl group in the minimum energy conformation as that calculated via classical methods. this is
in agreement with the minimum energy conformation

the interaction of the axial methyl group and the annelated
phenyl ring that causes the ring-inverted methyl axial form
to he of higher energy than the form with the methyl group
equatorial. the conformationalenergy maps also indicate
much more conformational restriction in the form with the
methyl group axial.
molecular superimpositions. the conformational
energy maps of the benzodiazepines are not strictly comparahle with those of the cyclic ureides, which really show
the relationship of one hydrophobic group, a phenyl ring,
with another hydrophobic group, either another phenyl or
an ethyl off the same asymmetric carhon. therefore, in
order to simulate such a conformational energy map, the
crystal structures of a number of benzodiazepines, dihydrohenzodiazepines, triazolohenzodiazepines,and anthramycin-like benzodiazepines were examined to ascertain
the torsion angle range of c1'-c5-cll-c10,92 which gives
the orientation of the annelated henzene ring with respect
to the 5-phenyl ring. this range, which is unlikely to he
much larger in solution, is shown by the dotted lines across
the conformational energy map for diazepam (figure 8).
this indicates, when all the conformational energy maps
are superimposed and the low-energy conformations examined, that there are two types of low-energy conformation of the diphenyl cyclic ureides comparahle with that
of the benzodiazepines: these are the conformations 7,

are only limited regions that are common to all the compounds, and these are marked on the map. all the other
anticonvulsants studied also have conformations with energies of less than 10 kcal/mol in this region. effectively,
this map shows the three-dimensional overlap of the a
phenyl ring of the cyclic ureides with the a phenyl ring

the best match were then graphically superimposed on
diazepam, the distances between corresponding heteroatoms and alignment guides through the phenyl rings
measured, and the relative orientations of the heteroatoms
noted. two types of superimposition were shown to be
possible and are depicted in figure 11,with the relationships between the ureide phenyl rings and heteroatoms and
the diazepam phenyl rings and heteroatoms being shown
in table 111. there are thus two models for the interactions of the cyclic ureides and diazepam with a common
receptor. all compounds were able to fit both models with
a root mean square (rms) of less than 0.8 a, with compounds such as  xxxd2924xxx  fitting with a rms of
less than 0.2 a. minor ring puckering of the hydantoins,
succinimides, and oxazolidinediones did not alter this value
by more than f 0 . 1 a. however, with the barbiturates a
bent ring, similar to that found in  xxxd2908xxx , was
used as it gave a significantly better rms value.
it did not prove possible to build a common model for
action of these drugs based on a high-energy conformation
of diazepam where the two phenyl rings were nearly coplanar. even a model based on a 30° rotation of the 5phenyl ring of diazepam from its minimum energy conformer, as has been suggested by loewloo for anxiolytic
activity, provides a much less satisfactory basis for a
common model for anticonvulsant action, as the energy
differences between the cyclic ureides in their best fit
conformations and their minimum-energy conformations
is large. the rms of fitted points also rose.
structure-activity relations. the structural features of active benzodiazepines were examined in order to
relate them to possible binding sites that might also be
accessible to cyclic ureides. it has been demonstrated
previously that n4 and the carbonyl group of diazepam

are important in benzodiazepine bonding.lwlo5 a role for
n1 of diazepam has also been proposed.1ffi studies on the
inhibition of [3h]diazepambinding show this to be the only
common heteroatom in all the active benzodiazepines
tested to date,97although this does not necessarily imply
that binding at this particular site is necessary for anticonvulsant activity. the other common features seen in
active benzodiazepines are c=x (where x = 0, s, n, or
c) a t the c2 position and the annelated aromatic ring. it
may not be necessary for this ring to be annelated, as is
shown by the structurally somewhat similar drug cgs 9896
(2-(p-chlorophenyl)pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5~-one),
at
present undergoing trials as an anxioselective anxiolytic
with anticonvulsant activity;o’ where the “free” phenyl ring
appears to be analogous to the a ring of benzodiazepine.
to date no active anticonvulsant benzodiazepines have
been found with a nonaromatic system in this position.
some variation in the substituent a t c5 seems possible
with tetrazepam (cyclohexyl substituent) available for
clinical use as a muscle relaxant. some 5-alkoxy-substituted benzodiazepines have been prepared that show anticonvulsant activity similar to that of diazepam,g0though
none is in clinical use and none appears to have been tested
against mes. 5-phenylbenzodiazepines also show significant changes in activity according to the substituent
pattern on the 5-phenyl ring. optimum activity appears
to be associated with electron-withdrawing substituents
at the 2’-position. the nitrogen usually a t the n4 may be
“swapped” to the 5-position as in clobazamgoor incorporated in a ring as in the anthramycin-like benzodiazepinesg1

drawing group such as chlorine in the 7-position gives
significant enhancement of activity when compared to
hydrogen and may interact electrostatically with a specific
site in the receptor.lm chlorinated analogues of phenobarbital are known, and these compounds do show greater
activity and longer duration of action than phenobarbitall10
although they have not been developed clinically.
an examination of the two superimposition models from
the cyclic ureides and diazepam shows that model b has
a slightly better match of all the cyclic ureides with diazepam. it provides a close match of the two hydrophobic
pockets, i.e., the phenyl rings, and also has heteroatoms
that may well be able to bind to the same groups on the
receptor as the n4 and 0 2 atoms of diazepam. one heteroatom (except in the case of diphenylsuccinimide) is in
close proximity to n4 of diazepam. the carbonyl groups
of the cyclic ureides closest to 0 2 of diazepam may also
be able to hydrogen bond to the same position of the receptor as 0 2 of diazepam, as indicated by a recent survey

compounds such as diphenylsuccinimide at the same site,
since the energy loss due to the loss of binding at one of
the points of contact would be small (in the order of 2-4
kcal/ mol).
superimposition model a has a reasonable fit of the two
hydrophobic phenyl groups, with the other possible sites
of interaction being that of n4 and a carbonyl group of
the cyclic ureides with the same receptor point as 0 2 of
diazepam. like model b, model a thus gives four possible
sites of interaction, although the two heteroatomic groups
do not provide as good a fit in terms of absolute distances
between matched sites.
the phenyl ethyl cyclic ureides can also be superimposed
on the diazepam-based models by matching of a phenyl
ring and of heteroatoms, as in the analogous diphenyl
compounds. each ureide enantiomer can be superimposed
in two ways, with the ureide phenyl ring overlapping either
the annelated phenyl ring or the “free” ring of diazepam.
poor enantiomeric data for cyclic ureides give only a slight
hint as to the more likely conformation. using the more
active r enantiomer of nirvanol and matching the phenyl
ring with the annelated phenyl ring of diazepam suggests
a model a superimposition, and supports the sar data
on benzodiazepines, indicating that an aromatic ring in this
position is necessary for activity. matching of the r enantiomer with the ”free” phenyl ring would support a
model b superimposition and indicate that occupation of

figure 12. illustration of a general anticonvulsant receptor site
capable of accepting anticonvulsants in either of the binding
modes, model a or model b, described in the text.

this hydrophobic pocket was necessary for activity against
mes. however, the s enantiomer also has significant
activity. this indicates either that both enantiomers bind
with the same orientation of the cyclic ureide ring, and a
phenyl ring in either hydrophobic pocket contributes to
activity, or that occupation of one specific hydrophobic
pocket of the receptor is necessary for activity the cyclic
ureide ring can bind either way up. the conflicting
stereoisomeric data for nirvanol, and scant enantiomeric
data on mes activity for the other ureides, make it impossible to rule out either possibility.
both models a and b require one phenyl ring, another
hydrophobic region, and a t least one heteroatom for activity. it is possible to match other anticonvulsants such
as carbamazepine to both such models with a reasonable
fit if only one aromatic region and two heteroatomic sites
are considered to be essential for binding. such a conclusion was previously reached by the comparison of carbamazepine, cyheptamide, 3-hydroxy-3-phenacyloxindole,
and  xxxd2924xxx .l16 however, either of our models
would require the carbamazepine ring nitrogen and the
amide oxygen or nitrogen to be involved in binding, in
contradistinction to codding’s model,l16 where only the
amide heteroatoms are thought to be important. it is also
possible to fit carbamazepine to both hydrophobic pockets

and two heteroatom binding sites, though the rms is
slightly above 1a. the oxindole also fits either model with
both hydrophobic pockets occupied and interactions with
two heteroatom receptor points derived from diazepam.
both model a and b are open to criticism, as neither
takes into full account the imide system in the ureides or
the amide system in the benzodiazepines. allowing some
degree of lateral displacement between phenyl ring centroids while maintaining near coplanarity with the proposed receptor sites enables other models to be considered,
including one intermediate between a and the camermans’
model, where there are again four sites of interaction,
including two hydrophobic pockets and the n4 and 0 2
receptor points derived from diazepam. this leads t o a
significant increase in rms from 0.2 to 0.8 a for the
compound of best fit,  xxxd2924xxx . similar manipulations with model b did not lead to any improvements of the model.

conclusion
the consistent feature of all the data presented here is
the key role played by the specific conformational arrangement of the two aromatic rings in the benzodiazepines and diphenyl cyclic ureides. there is, however,
no firm indication of which aromatic group is more important for activity nor of which of these rings is matched
by the single ring of the phenyl ethyl derivatives. the
relatively minor and inconsistent stereoisomeric activity
differences observed in the latter compounds could thus
be explained by the ability of phenyl groups in either
position to bind to the receptor. this in turn would imply
that the cyclic ureides all bind in one or other of the
binding modes, model a or model b, given in table 111.
there is, however, an alternative explanation suggested
by the similarity in the fit of the cyclic ureides to the
benzodiazepines provided by model a or model b. this
similarity implies that any individual ureide could bind
to the receptor site either way up, so that the phenyl rings
of both stereoisomers of the phenyl ethyl derivatives would
bind a t the same site. this general possibility, which is
illustrated in schematic form in figure 12, is an attractive
one in view of the very large number of variations in the
position and number of hydrogen-bindinggroups in cyclic
and other systems that have been synthesized without
substantial loss of anticonvulsant activity. a receptor such
as that illustrated in figure 12 can clearly accommodate
a diverse range of hydrogen-binding groups without unduly
prejudicing the seemingly more specific conformational
requirements of the two hydrophobic sites.
