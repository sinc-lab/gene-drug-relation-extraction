substrate reduction therapy: clinical evaluation in type 1 gaucher disease.  glycosphingolipid (gsl) lysosomal storage disorders are inherited enzyme deficiencies that result in pathological lysosomal accumulation of glycolipids, with widespread clinical consequences. type 1 gaucher disease is the commonest of these; the deficient enzyme in this condition is glucocerebrosidase. clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, recurrent infections and skeletal lesions. the condition can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ert). substrate reduction therapy is a new approach in which glycolipid accumulation is counteracted not by replacing the deficient enzyme but by reducing the substrate level to better balance residual activity of the deficient enzyme.  xxxd2645xxx  is an inhibitor of  xxxg2376xxx , a key enzyme in gsl synthesis. oral administration of  xxxd2645xxx  to patients with type 1 gaucher disease attenuates the synthesis of glucocerebroside, the substrate of the deficient glucocerebrosidase. in the first clinical study, patients with type 1 gaucher disease who had enlargement of the liver or spleen and (if present) the spleen at baseline received 12 months treatment with oral  xxxd2645xxx . there were mean decreases in liver and spleen volumes of 12% (7.9-16.4, p < 0.001) and 19% (14.3-23.7, p < 0.001), respectively. mean haemoglobin increased by 0.26 g dl(-1) (-0.5-0.57, not statistically significant) and platelet count by 8.3 x 10(9) l(-1) (1.9-14.7, p = 0.014).
