abstract: epilepsy is the most common primary neurological disorder known. epileptiform neurons undergo paroxysmal
depolarization shifts (pds), which result in the excessive sustained neuronal firing seen in epilepsy. these shifts are due
to either an impairment of gaba mediated inhibition, or an enhancement of aspartate or glutamate mediated excitatory
transmission. recent research has focused on the cellular biology of seizures. 4- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) is a major
inhibitory neurotransmitter of mammalian central nervous system. in neural and nonneural tissues, gaba is metabolized
by three enzymes- xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad), which produces gaba from  xxxd2431xxx , and the catabolic
enzymes gaba-transaminase ( xxxg8xxx ) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( xxxg138xxx ). production of succinic
acid by  xxxg138xxx  allows entry of the gaba carbon skeleton into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.  xxxg8xxx  is present in a
variety of circulating cells, including platelets and lymphocytes.  xxxg138xxx , the final enzyme of gaba catabolism, has been
detected in some of the tissues in which gad and  xxxg8xxx  have been identified. this paper is aimed at elucidating the
organization of the gaba shunt and covers a review on the antiepileptic drugs, both established and currently under
development targeted to the gaba shunt in order to bring about effective seizure control.

key words: gaba, gaba-transaminase,  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase, succinic semialdehyde dehyrogenase, tca cycle,

introduction
epilepsy, a common neurological disorder characterized
by recurrent spontaneous seizures, is a major health problem
that affects ~1-2% of the population worldwide. patients
often exhibit more than one type of seizure pattern. despite
progress in understanding the pathogenesis of seizures and
epilepsy, the cellular basis of human epilepsy remains a
mystery and, in the absence of a specific etiological understanding, approaches to drug therapy must be directed at the
control of symptoms that is the suppression of seizures.
chronic administration of antiepileptic or anticonvulsant
drugs (aeds) is the treatment-of-choice in epilepsy. the
selection of an aed is based mainly on its efficacy for
specific types of seizures, tolerability and safety [1].
epileptic seizures can be either generalized, originating
in both hemispheres simultaneously, or partial (focal),
originating in one or more parts of one or both hemispheres,
most commonly the temporal lobe [2]. in patients, the type
of epilepsy or epileptic syndrome is further characterized
according to features such as the type of seizure, etiology,
age of onset and electroencephalogram. an epilepsy or
epileptic syndrome can be either idiopathic, with a presumed
genetic basis, or symptomatic (acquired). seizures also may
be a toxic manifestation of the action of central nervous
system (cns) stimulants and certain other drugs.

in the past decade there has been considerable progress in
the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy, including the introduction
of several new aeds and improved formulations of older,
‘first-generation’ drugs, such as phenytoin (1), carbamazepine (2), phenobarbital (3), sodium valproate (4),  xxxd2056xxx  (5), and diazepam (6), and newer ‘second-generation’
drugs such as lamotrigine (7), vigabatrin (8), tiagabine (9),
topiramate (10), gabapentin (11), and  xxxd2466xxx  (12)
(fig. 1). the goal of therapy with an aed is to keep the
patient free of seizures without interfering with the normal
brain function. however, although the prognosis for seizure
control is good in at least 60% of patients, up to 40% of
individuals suffer from intractable, pharmacoresistant
epilepsy.
several mechanisms that underlie epilepsy have been
postulated, including an imbalance between excitatory and
inhibitory neurotransmission (fig. 2), alterations in neurotransmitter receptor expression and function, development of
‘epileptic’ ion channels (channelopathies), functional
(intrinsic) changes in neurons, development of epileptic networks (circuits) within and between brain regions, morphological changes such as hippocampal sclerosis and axonal
sprouting (leading to aberrant neuronal synchronization), and
genetic causes.
approaches being used for the identification of new
anticonvulsant drugs include the search for agents that block
specific cationic channels in neuronal membranes, agents
that enhance the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gammaamino butyric acid (gaba, 13), and agents that are capable
of inhibiting the activity of the excitatory neurotransmitters
glutamic and aspartic acids.

gaba
the amino acid transmitters in the brain have broadly
been divided into two general categories on the basis of their
functional actions: excitatory amino acid transmitters (glutamate, glu; aspartate, asp; cysteate, and homocysteate),
which depolarize neurons in the mammalian cns, and
inhibitory amino acid transmitters ( xxxd2177xxx ,
gaba; glycine, gly; taurine and beta-alanine), which hyperpolarize mammalian neurons [3].
the metabolism of l-glutamate in a process, which
involves transamination and oxidation to alpha-oxoglutarate, by
slices of brain, has long been known [4, 5]. it is also known
that the uptake of glutamate in the brain is usually accompanied by a simultaneous uptake of k+ ions [6-9] leading to
potassium ion accumulation. this is due to the action of the
active na+- k+ pump, which allows a rapid influx of k+ ions,
owing to the rise in internal na+. it is reported that the
activity of the na+- k + pump decreases due to the depletion
of the higher energy phosphate compounds that provide the
immediate energy for the na+- k+ pump [10].
since 1883, when gaba was first synthesized it was
known for many years as a product of microbial and plant

metabolism. it was not until 1950, when roberts et al. [11]
reported the presence of  xxxd2177xxx  in numerous
two-dimensional paper chromatograms of protein-free
extracts of fresh mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, human and
frog brains. they observed only traces of gaba in a large
number of extracts of many other normal and neoplastic
tissues and in urine and blood. from their experiments using
isotopically labeled  xxxd2431xxx  it was proved that the
latter amino acid could serve as a precursor for gaba,
specifically by a alpha-decarboxylation of  xxxd2431xxx .
the functional role of gaba as a possible inhibitory
neurotransmitter was first elucidated by elliott and his
collaborators [12, 13], and then later by curtis et al. [14].
the gaba shunt
after it was proved that  xxxd2177xxx  is present in
relatively high concentrations in the mammalian brain [15,
11], bessman et al. [16] discovered a chemical reaction
utilizing this amino acid, which involved transamination
with alpha-ketoglutaric acid. reports say that studies using brain
preparations [16, 17] were hindered by the nature of the
system catalyzing the reaction. even the active, soluble

extracts from microorganisms [18-20] were further not
purified.

boxylase, usually lower brain gaba levels and as a result
precipitate seizures [32].

the pioneering research on the identification of the
enzymes involved in the metabolism of gaba, started with
the discovery that a species of pseudomonas fluorescens
when grown on either pyrrolidine [21] or putrescine [22]
adapts to the utilization of these compounds by a route
involving ∆1 - pyrroline,  xxxd2177xxx , succinic semialdehyde, and  xxxd3251xxx . preliminary evidence suggested
[23, 24] that the enzymes involved in this route are gammaaminobutyric- glutamic transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.

as mentioned previously gaba is formed by the alphadecarboxylation of l-  xxxd2431xxx , a reaction catalyzed by
gad, an enzyme that occurs uniquely in the mammalian
cns and retinal tissue. also the precursor of gaba, lglutamic acid can be formed from alpha-oxoglutarate via, transamination or reaction with ammonia. gaba is intimately
related to the oxidative metabolism of carbohydrates in the
cns by means of a “shunt”. since 2-oxoglutarate and
 xxxd3251xxx  are two intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid
(tca) cycle, the entry of either into the krebs cycle from
the gaba metabolic pathway is referred to as the “gaba
shunt” [3]. the metabolic intermediates of the gaba
pathway in relation to the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle are
shown in fig. (3).

later in 1959, jakoby et al. [25] reported the purification
and properties of gamma-aminobutyric- glutamic transaminase and
gave a kinetic analysis of the reaction, which it catalyzes.
this research group purified a soluble gamma-aminobutyric- glutamic transaminase from extracts of a strain of pseudomonas
fluorescens and showed in a confirming manner that it
catalyzes a reversible transamination with gamma-aminobutyric
acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid as substrates yielding succinic
semialdehyde and  xxxd2431xxx .
following this initial evidence, a flurry of research
findings proved the major pathway for the degradation of gammaaminobutyric acid, as the transamination reaction with alphaketoglutarate (alpha-kg), catalyzed by the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme  xxxg8xxx 
( xxxg8xxx , e.c. 2.6.1.19) [26]. in this reaction, it is reported that the plp is converted to pyridoxamine-5’-phosphate
(pmp), which is restored to plp by transamination with alphakg, generating the excitatory neurotransmitter l- glutamate.
hence a selective inhibition of this enzyme results in an
increase in the availability of gaba, the therapeutic uses of
which are implicated in the treatment of epilepsy [27],
parkinson’s disease [28], huntington’s chorea [29],
alzheimer’s disease [30], tardive dyskinesia, schizophrenia,
anxiety and other behavioral disorders. studies also show
that an increase in the level of gaba blocks the effects of
drug addiction [31]. conversely agents, which inhibit the
synthesizing enzyme of gaba, which is glutamate decar-

hence as a logical strategy, to increase the level of gammaaminobutyric acid in the brain in order to prevent the
occurrence of seizure disorders, either one of the following
steps should be adopted,
1) increasing the activity of the enzyme  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase (gad), which synthesizes gaba (or)
2) selective irreversible/reversible inhibition
gaba-catabolizing enzyme  xxxg8xxx .

of

the

 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (ec. 4.1.1.15)
from the initial work of roberts et al. [11], it is clear that
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad) is the only enzyme
responsible for the conversion of l- xxxd2431xxx  to gaba
and the reaction is irreversible. in contrast to the gaba
metabolizing enzyme gaba-transaminase in mammals, this
relatively specific decarboxylase is found primarily in the
cns, where it occurs in higher concentrations in the gray
matter. but erdo et al. [33] showed that gad is also found
in many nonneural tissues, in a variety of cell types of
different developmental origin, including epithelial, endothelial, endocrine and germ cells. the brain enzyme has been
purified to homogeneity and its properties studied in detail

[3]. it has a ph optimum of about 6.5 and requires pyridoxal5’-phosphate (plp), a form of  xxxd3049xxx  as a coenzyme.
two isoforms of gad have been identified, which are
encoded by two distinct genes [34, 35]. these two isoforms,
designated  xxxg850xxx  and  xxxg849xxx  in accordance with their
molecular weights, differ in amino acid sequence, cellular
and subcellular location, and interaction with the gad
cofactor, plp [3]. of the two isoforms characterized,  xxxg850xxx 
shows a relatively high affinity for the cofactor. from the
studies by martin et al. [36], it is known that the majority of
neural gad is present as apoenzyme (i.e., without covalently-linked plp), and this apo-gad serves as an activatable reservoir of the enzyme.
gad activators as anticonvulsants
an extract of  xxxd2199xxx  l. leaves has been clinically
used for the treatment of certain cerebral dysfunctions and
neurological disorders [37]. furthermore, bars et al. [38]
demonstrated that the extract exerts beneficial effects on
dementia of the alzheimer type and multi-infarct dementia.
the extract is reported to contain multiple compounds, e.g.,
flavonoids and terpenoids (ginkgolides and bilobalide) that
contribute to the neuroprotective effects and the modulation
of neurotransmission, which may be the basis for the effects
of the extract in the central nervous system [37, 39].

oxender et al. [40] reported that 11 activated gad activity. the literature evidence supporting this postulate came
from the studies of taylor et al. [41, 42]. at a concentration
of 1 mm of 11 was found to significantly activated gad
activity [43].
sasaki et al. demonstrated that bilobalide (14, fig. 4)
possessed dose dependent anticonvulsant activity against
convulsions induced by isoniazid and 4-o-methylpyridoxine
(mpn) in mice [44], and causes elevation in hippocampal
gaba levels, possibly through potentiation of  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase (gad) activity. thus, it was hypothesized
that the increase in gaba levels caused by 14 may be
responsible for its anticonvulsant effects. consistent with
this, it was found that isoniazid-induced reduction of mouse
hippocampal gaba levels was effectively prevented by
pretreatment with 14 [45]. on the other hand, it was known
that isoniazid and mpn inhibit gad activity in the brain
[46-48] however, the prevention of gad inhibition by 14
remained uncertain. therefore further experiments seemed
necessary to conclude that the enhancement of gaba
synthesis induced by 14 contributed to the mechanism of its
anticonvulsant activity. hence sasaki et al. [49] examined
the effect of 14 on mpn-induced changes in gaba and
glutamate levels, and gad activity in mouse brain. pretreatment with 14 effectively prevented mpn-induced

decrease in gaba levels in the hippocampus and cerebral
cortex. moreover, the mpn-induced reduction in the hippocampal gad activity was also prevented by the treatment
with 14. therefore, it was concluded that potentiation of
gabaergic transmission by 14 contributed to its anticonvulsant effects against certain types of convulsions.
sasaki et al. [45] in 1999 reported that treatment with 14
caused a significant enhancement of the total gad activity
in the hippocampal and cerebral cortical homogenates to 118
and 112% of the control activity, respectively. on the other
hand, when 14 (0.1–100 µm) was added in vitro to hippocampal homogenates, it had no significant effect on the total
gad activity.
regarding the mechanism of action of  xxxd3485xxx  (15)
some authors [50, 51] have reported a stimulation of
 xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase (gad) activity. furthermore,
these findings were observed in in vivo experiments. this
latter experimental approach does not allow discrimination
as to whether the drug stimulates the enzyme directly or, by
an indirect mechanism. wikinski et al. [52] characterized the
in vitro effect of 15 on gad activity in adult and neonatal
brains. from the results it was proved that 15 did not induce
changes on gad activity either in the cerebral cortex or in
the rest of the brain of adult animals. but  xxxd1891xxx -3 m, 15
induced an increase in gad activity in homogenates of
noncortical brain areas of neonates and no increments were
found in the cerebral cortex of these animals. hence it was
concluded that 15 induced changes on gad activity in
neonatal stages of development but not in adult brain.
taylor et al. [41] showed that 3-alkyl-4-aminobutanoic
acids ( 16) are in vitro activators of brain l-gad that show
anticonvulsant activity. since activation of gad leads to
increased concentrations of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
gaba in vitro , it was reported that these compounds could
represent a new class of anticonvulsant agents. following
this, it was showed that 3-alkylglutamic acid analogues (17)

also activated gad and that all of the compounds in both the
series were active anticonvulsant agents against low intensity
electroshock in mice. the most active compound, 3-isobutyl
gaba (16a), was tested further against maximal electroshock seizure test in mice and was shown to be very potent
after both intravenous and oral administration without
causing ataxia. silverman et al. [42] also reported 3-alkyl-4aminobutyric acids to be the first class of anticonvulsant
agents that activate l-gad.
loscher in 1981 [53] studied the effect of inhibitors of
 xxxg8xxx  on the metabolism of gaba in
brain tissue and synaptosomal fractions. the compounds
included in the study were 8,  xxxd2169xxx  (18), gamma-acetylenic
gaba (19), ethanolamine-o-sulphate (20), and  xxxd439xxx  (21) together with gaba and the antiepileptic
drug 4. all of the above-mentioned compounds were administered to mice in doses equieffective to raise the electroconvulsive threshold by 30 v. the animals were killed at the
time of maximal anticonvulsant effect of the respective drugs
and gaba,  xxxg8xxx  and gad were determined in whole
brain and synaptosomes, respectively. all drugs studied
brought about significant increase in both whole brain and
synaptosomal gaba concentrations. furthermore, all drugs,
except gaba and 19, activated gad in the synaptosomal
fraction. this was most pronounced with 20, which induced
a two-fold activation of this enzyme but exerted only a weak
inhibitory effect on  xxxg8xxx . these results suggest that
activation of gad is an important factor in the mechanism
of elevation of gaba concentrations by the compounds
used in this study.
gamma - aminobutyric - alpha - ketoglutaric acid
transaminase (ec. 2.6.1.19)
there is accumulating evidence, which states that the
concentration of the non-protein amino acid gaba in the
mammalian adult brain is relatively constant under a variety
of physiological stresses [54, 55]. earlier studies showed that

132

current drug metabolism, 2005, vol. 6, no. 2

gaba is degraded by a specific mitochondrial enzyme 4aminobutyric-alpha-ketoglutaric aminotransferase ( xxxg8xxx ),
[56] which apart from the tissues of the cns, is also found
in other tissues of mammals [57, 58]. studies on  xxxg8xxx 
purified from human tissues, indicate that nonneural  xxxg8xxx  is similar to the brain enzyme with respect to molecular
weight, substrate affinity, isoelectric ph, and response to
specific inhibitors [59, 60]. this enzyme also requires plp
as a cofactor, and its activity is influenced by the concentration of its cofactor [61]. under physiological conditions,
the cofactor plp seems to be tightly bound to  xxxg8xxx  in
the brain, since a decrease in its free concentration did not
affect the activity of  xxxg8xxx  [62, 63]. from the studies of
roberts et al. [64] it was known that under normal conditions, the level of gaba in any particular brain area was
related directly to levels of gad activity, but appear unrelated
to the levels of  xxxg8xxx  [65]. the aminotransferase isolated
from brain tissues is a dimer consisting of subunits of 50,
000 molecular weight each [66]. later, researchers went on
to elucidate the crystal structure of  xxxg8xxx  [67], followed
by studies on active site modeling for the enzyme explaining
substrate specificity and inhibitor reactivities. the brain
transaminase has a ph optimum of 8.2, and the brain ratio of
 xxxg8xxx /gad activity is almost always greater than 1.
 xxxg8xxx  inhibitors as anticonvulsants
there is a rich source of evidence, which report an
alteration in the concentration of gaba in the brains of
adult rodents after the intraperitoneal (or) intravenous
injection of a number of compounds [68-74]. battistin et al.
[75] examined the effect of various anticonvulsant drugs on
brain gaba levels, gad and  xxxg8xxx  activities. the level
of gaba was increased by the treatment with 1. the drug
had no effect on  xxxg8xxx  activity, whereas gad activity
was inhibited. 2 increased the gaba level but did not affect
gad and  xxxg8xxx  activities. diazepam (6) had no effect on
gaba level and gad activity, whereas it caused a slight
inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  activity. administration with 3
decreased gaba level only at the higher concentration.
the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine (7) has been attributed to inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium channels
[76-79], which in turn could inhibit release of transmitter
glutamate [76, 80, 81]. interestingly, the therapeutic effect of
7 is different from that of other antiepileptic drugs that act on
sodium channels, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine. for
instance, 7 is effective in the treatment of childhood absence
epilepsy, whereas phenytoin and carbamazepine are not [82].
from this we can infer that 7 acts via more mechanisms than
inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium channels. hence,
hassel et al. [83] studied the effects of chronic administration of a clinically relevant dose of the drug. chronic
treatment with 7 caused the level of gaba to increase by
25% in the hippocampus, but not in the other brain areas. in
the hippocampus the activity of gad increased by 12% and
that of  xxxg8xxx /succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
( xxxg138xxx ) increased by 21%, but in the frontal cortex the
enzyme activities remained at control values.
vigabatrin (4-aminohex-5-enoate;  xxxd3508xxx , 8) is a
gaba analog that was developed to increase gaba
concentration in the central nervous system. it is one of the

yogeeswari et al.

most effective antiepileptic drugs introduced in recent years
[84-89]. 8 has been used widely and successfully as
adjunctive treatment for partial epilepsy but is also effective
as monotherapy and appears to be particularly effective in
numerous, difficult-to-treat syndromic epilepsies including
sturge-weber, landau-kleffner and lennox-gastaut. it has
also been advocated as the drug of choice in the management
of infantile spasms due to tuberous sclerosis [90]. 8
irreversibly inhibits  xxxg8xxx , by acting as a substrate for
this enzyme. biochemical investigations into the mode of
action of 8 have demonstrated that initial reversible binding
to the plp cofactor was followed by an irreversible step
leading to enzyme inactivation [91]. it bound covalently to
the active site on  xxxg8xxx , where it blocked further enzymatic degradation of gaba. the increase in brain gaba
level after oral administration with 8 has been established
in animal models and human studies [92]. moreover, on
the basis of experiments with audiogenic sensitive rats,
engelborghs et al. [93] suggested that 8 possessed an additional mechanism of action by reduction of brain excitatory
amino acid levels and/or elevation of glycine level.
qume et al. [94] determined the gaba content and
activities of gad and  xxxg8xxx  in rat brain, liver and
kidney, following 2, 8 and 21 day oral administration of 8
and 20, two irreversible inhibitors of  xxxg8xxx .  xxxg8xxx 
activity was significantly decreased (over 80%) in liver,
brain and kidney, although there was 2-3 times the residual
activity left in the brain compared with the peripheral organs.
gaba content was significantly elevated in the liver (300l500%), plasma (200-300%) and brain (200-300%), although
the kidney gaba content was reduced (by 60- 70%) compared with control. gad activity was decreased following 8
day treatment in liver and brain. liver and kidney  xxxg8xxx 
activity were almost completely abolished following 2 day
treatment, and this was maintained with further treatment;
this was in contrast with brain, whose  xxxg8xxx  activity
became progressively less with continuing treatment.
in continuation of this work, armijo et al. [95] studied
the effects of increasing doses of 8 on platelet  xxxg8xxx  and
brain gaba levels in rats. they reported a relationship of
 xxxg8xxx  inhibition in platelets and brain with the increase
in brain gaba, as percents of the control, at 24 h after
single and after 3 and 8 days of treatment with increasing
doses of 8 in rats. brain  xxxg8xxx  activity was progressively
inhibited by single doses of 8 higher than 30 mg/kg, this
being accompanied by a progressive increase in brain gaba
concentration. the correlation between platelet and brain
 xxxg8xxx  after single doses of 8 has been described
previously [96].
a correlation between increase in brain gaba concentrations induced by 8 and 19 and attenuation of audiogenic
seizure intensity was established in the study by schechter et
al. [97] 8 and 19, two catalytic irreversible inhibitors of
 xxxg8xxx  were found to protect dba/2 mice against
audiogenically induced seizures in a similar dose- and timedependent manner by producing marked and sustained
elevations in mouse brain gaba concentrations. seizure
intensity was reduced by 50% when brain gaba was
increased to 265% and 264% of control values by the two
inhibitors.

sills et al. [98] investigated the in vivo effects of 11 on
several gaba-related neurochemical parameters in mouse
brain. 11 is a novel antiepileptic drug (aed) used for the
treatment of partial seizures [99]. it is a hydrophilic analogue
of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba and was designed
to act as a gabaa receptor agonist that could freely cross
the blood-brain barrier [100, 101]. 11 has an experimental
anticonvulsant profile similar to that of 12 [102]. previous
studies, employing isolated tissue slices [103] and in vitro
enzyme assays [40], have suggested that 11 may exert its
antiepileptic effects, at least in part, by an action on the
gabaergic system. it is effective against tonic seizures
induced by a variety of chemoconvulsants and is also active
in the maximal electroshock test and several rodent models
of genetic reflex epilepsy [102, 104].
in the neurochemical studies, single dose 11 increased
mouse brain  xxxg8xxx  activity at 4 h post-administration,
whereas repeated treatment with 11 reduced the enzyme
activity. in a study by taylor et al. [41, 42], inhibition by 11
of two isoforms of  xxxg8xxx  from the rat brain cortex was
further characterized. consistent with the previous report
[43], inhibition of both isoforms of  xxxg8xxx  by gabapentin
was weak. the ki values were 9-14 times higher than the
apparent km values for gaba.
 xxxd3485xxx  (di-n-propylacetate, 15) is a branched fatty
acid whose anticonvulsant activity was serendipitously
discovered when it was tested as a solvent in a drug screening study.  xxxd3485xxx  is the most commonly used antiepileptic drug today in the treatment of generalized epilepsy and
partial epilepsy. its use is also indicated in the treatment of
tonic and clonic seizures, absences and myoclonic disorders,
and the drug produces few adverse events on the central
nervous system [105]. in spite of its wide use for many
years, the mechanism of action of 15 is still not fully
understood. johannessen [106] reported the effects of 15 on
the gabaergic system. baldino et al. [107] reported that 15
selectively enhanced gabaergic inhibition in the cerebral
cortex. an increase in whole brain gaba levels of 15-45%
has been shown in rodent brain after acute administration of
15 [108-110].
one of the early reports on the mechanism of action of 15
states that there has not been any significant inhibition of
 xxxg8xxx  activity in brain homogenates from rat/mouse after

administration of 15 [108]. hence, the process through
which the increments of gaba contents are achieved is still
under investigation, but it has been shown that this drug
inhibits the activity of  xxxg8xxx  [111, 112]. from the studies
of cash et al. [113] it became evident that at anticonvulsant
doses, the 15 and 2-methyl 2-ethyl caproic acid (22) preferentially inhibit  xxxg8xxx  thus inducing a rise in cerebral
gaba level.
 xxxd2169xxx  (5-amino-1, 3-cyclohexadienylcarboxylic
acid, 18), a naturally occurring neurotoxin isolated from
streptomyces toyocaenis, has been shown to be a mechanism-based inactivator of  xxxg8xxx  by rando et al. [114].
inactivation resulted from reaction of 18 with the plp
cofactor (fig. 5). wood et al. [115] reported the inhibitory
effects of 18 on the activity of  xxxg8xxx . addition of 18 to
brain and liver extracts caused great inhibition of  xxxg8xxx 
activity in vitro, which correlated well also with intramuscular administration to mice wherein the inhibition of the
brain enzyme activity by 18 was the maximum. wood et al.
[116] also reported the inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  by l-alpha-aminobeta-chloropropionic acid hydroxamide (23). the intramuscular
administration of 23 (2 mmol/kg) to mice strongly inhibited
the activity of  xxxg8xxx , but not gad, in the brain of the
animals. administration of the compound 3 h prior to
isoniazid (24) treatment significantly delayed the onset of
seizures induced by 24.
loscher in 1980 [117] undertook a comparative study of
the inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  by different anticonvulsant drugs.
fourteen anticonvulsant drugs were examined for their
effects on the activity of  xxxg8xxx . only the nonspecific
enzyme inhibitor 21 (ic50 = 2.7µm) proved to be as potent as
the catalytic inhibitors 8 (350 µm), 18 (1.8µm), and 19 (150
µm) and with respect to inhibition of  xxxg8xxx . 20, 22 and
24 were less effective inhibitors of the  xxxg8xxx  activity
(ic50 > 1 mm). none of the clinically established antiepileptic drugs tested [viz. 1, 3, 4, 5,  xxxd3438xxx  (25) and
dimethadione (26)] produced inhibition comparable to the
aforementioned drugs. a slight inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  (8 to
28%) was seen only with high concentrations of 4, 5 and 25.
baxter et al. in 1961 reported one of the early evidences,
which described quantitatively the interrelationship between
the levels of gaba and the activities of its metabolic
enzymes. they proved that the compounds 21 and hydroxyl-

amine (27) inhibited the transaminase enzyme in the rat brain
in vivo [64] in the process increasing the levels of gaba.
about ten-fold increase in gaba concentrations of rat
brains due to the inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  activity by certain
potent and relatively specific compounds, such as 19, 20 and
recently 8 have been reported [118-124].

from the results, it was concluded that 28a was a strong
inhibitor of  xxxg8xxx .
to examine whether or not the inhibition is by the
formation of a schiff’s base with the cofactor plp, the effect
of plp on the inhibition was studied. the well-known
compound 27 inhibited  xxxg8xxx  activity by 73% at a 1.0
mm concentration, and the inhibition was decreased to 56%
by addition of 1 mm plp. on the other hand, the inhibition
of 28a was not influenced by plp addition. thus it was
concluded that the inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  by 28a was not the
result of schiff's base formation between 28a and plp. this
study showed that 28a and 28b, strongly inhibited  xxxg8xxx 
and that a free hydroxyamino group and conformational
flexibility of the hydroxyamino group were necessary for the
strong inhibitory activity. these results imply the possibility
of the hydroxyamino group being an effective mimic of
carboxylic acid for designing enzyme inhibitors.

later, the possible association of gaba and inhibitors of
 xxxg8xxx  with epilepsy was studied thoroughly [125]. jung
et al. showed an association of a rise in gaba levels with
quiet and withdrawn behavior, sleep and protection against
epileptic seizures [126]. hence it is deduced that agents that
are effective  xxxg8xxx  inhibitors were considered a useful
source for the synthesis and development of newer anticonvulsant drugs.
fushiya et al. [127] synthesized hydroxyamino analogues
of  xxxd2177xxx  and evaluated for inhibitory activity
toward  xxxg8xxx . the compound, 3-(hydroxyamino)
propylamine (28a), showed a potent inhibitory activity. the
activity of inhibition was comparable to those of 15 and 21.
3-(hydroxyaminomethyl)piperidine (28b), a cyclic analogue
of 28a, also showed a potent inhibitory activity, whereas 3(methoxyamino)propylamine (28c), 3-(n-hydroxy- n-methylamino)propylamine (28d) and 4-(hydroxyamino)piperidine
(28e) showed weak activity.

 xxxd2738xxx  (no) has recently been proposed as an
endogenous anticonvulsant substance [128]. in another study
the absence of no synthesis during epilepsy increased the
severity of the seizures and the consecutive neuronal death
[129, 130]. in support of these findings jayakumar et al.
[131] showed a clear correlation between no and  xxxg8xxx 
activity in the brain. no is formed via oxidative deamination
of l-arginine (29) by no synthase (nos) and has the
activity to evoke the release of several neurotransmitters
including gaba [132]. sodium nitroprusside (30) (300
mm) an no donor doubled the release of gaba [133]. in
this study, 10 min after the administration of  xxxd220xxx , the no

the inhibitory activity of 28a on  xxxg8xxx  was tested at
various gaba and inhibitor concentrations. at the concentrations tested in this experiment (0-3.0 mm), the inhibition
was found to be competitive with respect to gaba and the
ki value of  xxxg8xxx  for 28a was determined to be 0.4 mm.

the gaba shunt

and gaba concentrations in brain cortex were found to be
increased and the activity of  xxxg8xxx  diminished. the study
also used the nos inhibitor l-name (n-nitro l-arginine
methyl ester, 31) to assess the role of no on  xxxg8xxx . ten
minutes after the administration of 31 the no concentration
decreased and the activity of  xxxg8xxx  moderately increased,
suggesting the requirement of gaba.
paul et al. [134] determined the concentrations of gaba
and its immediate precursor, glutamate, in whole brain of rat
treated with a no increasing dose of its precursor, 29. the
effect of 29 on the activities of gad and  xxxg8xxx  was also
tested. 29 increased the concentration of no, 5 and 30 min
after administration. an increased gaba concentration was
found in similarly treated animals. these results were
accompanied by an inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  activity. 29 did
not alter glutamate concentration and the activity of gad.
both no and gaba concentrations were decreased 5 and
30 min after treatment with 31.  xxxg8xxx  activity was
increased in these animals. the activity of gad and the
concentration of glutamate were not altered by 31. hence the
results of this study imply a role of no on the degradation of
gaba in the brain.
choi et al. [135] synthesized four cyclohexene analogues
of gaba (32a-d) and beta-alanine as conformationally rigid
analogues of 8 and as potential mechanism-based inactivators  xxxg8xxx . the corresponding cyclopentene analogues
were previously reported to be inhibitors, but not inactivators
of  xxxg8xxx  [136]. cis-3-aminocyclohex-4-ene-1-carboxylic
acid (32a) and cis-2-aminocyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid
(32b) showed time- and concentration-dependent, irreversible inactivation of  xxxg8xxx . in both cases, it was observed
that the inactivations are protected by substrate, indicating
that they are active site-directed. the study also showed that
trans-3-aminocyclohex-4-ene-1-carboxylic acid (32c) and
trans-2-aminocyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid (32d) are not
inactivators but are competitive reversible inhibitors of
 xxxg8xxx .
silverman et al. [137] synthesized (z)- and (e)-4-amino2-(trifluoromethyl)-2-butenoic acid (33a-b) and investigated
them as potential mechanism-based inactivators of  xxxg8xxx 
in a continuing effort to map the active site of this enzyme.
the core alpha-trifluoromethyl- alpha, beta-unsaturated ester moiety
was prepared. both 33a and 33b inhibited  xxxg8xxx  in a
time-dependent manner, but displayed non-pseudo-firstorder inactivation kinetics; initially, the inactivation rate
increased with time. further investigation demonstrated that
the actual inactivator is generated enzymatically from 33a or
33b. these inactivating species were released from the active
site prior to inactivation, and as a result, 33a and 33b cannot
be defined as mechanism-based inactivators. furthermore,
33a and 33b were found to be alternate substrates for
 xxxg8xxx , transaminated by the enzyme with km values of
0.74 and 20.5 mm, respectively. this experiment suggested
that a covalent bond between the actual inactivating species
and the enzyme active site was formed.
 xxxd2079xxx  (34) is a novel antiepileptic agent with a
broad spectrum of activity in experimental seizure models
[138]. it is effective in threshold and supramaximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol models and against seizures
induced by  xxxd2947xxx  and n-methyl-d-aspartate [139]. in

current drug metabolism, 2005, vol. 6, no. 2

135

addition, 34 has activity against audiogenically induced
convulsions in the genetically epilepsy-prone rat [140] and
dba/2 mouse [139] and blocks all seizure manifestations of
both amygdaloid [141] and hippocampal kindling [142]. 34
has been proposed to possess multiple mechanisms of action
[143, 144]. it has been shown to activate voltage-sensitive
potassium channels [145, 146] and at higher concentrations,
to potentiate the action of gaba at the gabaa receptor, to
increase gaba synthesis [147] and block sodium channels.
hence sills et al. [148] investigated the effects of single and
repeated treatment with 34 on a variety of gaba- and
glutamate-related neurochemical parameters in the mouse
brain. single-dose of 34 (0–30 mg/kg) was without effect on
whole-brain gaba concentrations 4 h after administration,
but significantly (p < 0.05) lowered brain glutamate (to 85%
of control) and glutamine (to 82% of control) levels.
repeated treatment with 34 (0–30 mg/kg) significantly (p <
0.05) reduced whole-brain  xxxg8xxx  activity (to
80% of control) 4 h after the final dose. acute treatment with
the drug was essentially without effect on enzyme activity.
hence this study suggested that in addition to enhancing
regional gaba synthesis, the drug might also exert a modest
inhibition of gaba metabolism, possibly with a greater net
effect on gaba turnover than originally envisaged.
duffy et al. [149] reported phenylethylidenehydrazine
(35), an analog of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, betaphenylethylhydrazine (phenelzine, 36), to be a novel  xxxg8xxx  inhibitor, which reduces epileptiform activity in rat
hippocampal slices by increasing brain levels of gaba. in
vitro pre-treatment with 35 (100 µm) increased the gaba
content of hippocampal slices by approximately 60% over
vehicle-treated controls, but it had no effect on basal field
excitatory postsynaptic potentials, tonic gaba currents, or
long-term potentiation.
silverman et al. [150] in 1989 put forth a mechanistic
classification of the inactivators of  xxxg8xxx . accordingly,
compounds that inactivate  xxxg8xxx  by a michael addition
mechanism, leading to modification of an active-site residue
are class i inactivators. those that proceed by an enamine
mechanism and give ternary adducts are class ii inactivators.
those that modify only the plp cofactor are class iii
inactivators; if the inactivation involves aromatization of the
inactivator, it is a class iiia inactivation, and if no aromatization is involved, then it is a class iiib inactivation. the
last class of inactivators (class iv) are not classified on the
basis of the mechanism, but rather, that they require the
enzyme to be in the pyridoxamine-5’-phosphate (pmp) form.
silverman et al. [151] reported a selective inhibition of
 xxxg8xxx  by (3r, 4r), (3s, 4s) - and (3r, 4s), (3s, 4r)-4amino-5-fluoro-3-phenylpentanoic acids (37a-d). neither
compound caused time-dependent inactivation of the
enzyme. however, both 37a-d were competitive reversible
inhibitors of  xxxg8xxx ; the k i for 37a-b was smaller than the
km for gaba. hence the results suggested that 37a-d bind
to the active site of  xxxg8xxx .
(s)-4-amino-5-halopentanoic acids (38) were previously
shown to irreversibly inhibit pig brain  xxxg8xxx , and a
mechanism for the inactivation was proposed by silverman
et al. [152]. also studies showed (s)-4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid (38a) to be a potent inhibitor of gad, but neither

37a nor 37b at concentrations 40 times the ki of 38a caused
any detectable competitive inhibition of gad. therefore, the
incorporation of a phenyl substituent at the c-3-position of
38a confirmed selective inhibition of  xxxg8xxx  over gad.
levy et al. [153] investigated the effects of intraperitoneal
administration of 38a, a mechanism-based covalent inactivator of  xxxg8xxx , on whole brain gaba metabolism in
mice. a dose-dependent and time-dependent irreversible
inactivation of  xxxg8xxx  was observed with a concomitant
increase in whole brain gaba levels. the chloro analogue,
(s)-4-amino-5-chloropentanoic acid (38b), was found to be
ineffective. (z)-4-amino-2-fluorobut-2-enoic acid (39) was
shown to be a mechanism-based inactivator of pig brain
 xxxg8xxx  in another study by silverman et al. [154]. following this study, burke et al. [155] reported 4-(oxoalkyl)substituted gaba analogues as inactivators and substrates
of  xxxg8xxx . 4-amino-5-oxopentanoic acid (40) emerged
out as an inactivator of the enzyme.
jung et al. [156] reported omega-fluoromethyl analogues of
omega-amino acids as irreversible inhibitors of  xxxg8xxx . specifically, omega-monofluoromethyl and omega-difluoromethyl analogues of the known substrates of  xxxg8xxx , namely beta-

alanine, alpha- xxxd2177xxx , and 5-aminopentanoic acid,
were reported to be time-dependent inhibitors of purified
 xxxg8xxx . the inhibitory activity decreased with increasing
chain length. in vitro , the inhibitory activity decreased with
increasing fluorine substitution of the methyl group and
trifluoromethyl derivatives were found to be devoid of
 xxxg8xxx  inhibitory activity in vitro or in vivo.
meldrum et al. [157] studied the effects of some of the
anticonvulsant drugs on the cerebral enzymes metabolizing
gaba in mouse brain homogenates. slight inhibition (5 to
20%) of  xxxg8xxx  activity was seen with 5 (0.1 mm), 15 (0.1
mm), and chlordiazepoxide (41) (0.1 mm). no anticonvulsant drug (even at a concentration of 10 mm) produced
inhibition comparable to that seen with 21 (65% at 0.01
mm).

of the enzyme, showing that it had four identical subunits of
40, 000 molecular weight each. it is also reported that
 xxxg138xxx  is dependent on the coenzyme nad+ for its final
catabolic action on gaba and the reaction catalyzed by the
dehydrogenase proceeds in the direction of formation of
 xxxd3251xxx  and nadh [158]. moreover the enzyme is
sensitive to inhibition by the substrate succinic semialdehyde
as well as by the product nadh. hearl et al. [159] reported
the possibility of  xxxg8xxx  and  xxxg138xxx  forming a part of a
multienzyme complex, since both of them are present
together in the mitochondrial matrix. thus it was conceived
that this enzyme cluster could prevent the leakage of
intermediate metabolites, which are harmful to the cell. the
enzyme purified from human brain has a ph optimum of
about 9.2 [3].

vitro [162-164].  xxxg138xxx  has been claimed to be inhibited
15% by 15 at concentrations of <1 mm in vitro [164, 165] by
a non-competitive mechanism. in contrast to these experiments, other studies have shown that  xxxg138xxx  was inhibited
50% by competitive inhibition with 0.5-1 mm 15 [162, 163].

dehydrogenase

simler et al. [160] reported that the agent 4, the salt of an
8-carbon branched fatty acid, produces a 30-40% elevation
of total brain gaba following a single intraperitoneal
injection into mice, and the time of peak elevation of gaba
corresponds to the time of maximum protection against
seizures. following the extraction of brain  xxxg8xxx  and its
assay in the presence of 4, these authors have concluded that
the rise in gaba concentration results from the inhibition of
this enzyme. however, since the metabolic route of gaba
degradation involves two enzymes, namely  xxxg8xxx  and
 xxxg138xxx , the possibility arises that more than one enzyme is
inhibited by 4. hence to understand the specific nature of the
drug, bradford et al. [161] reported an inhibition of  xxxg138xxx 
by 4, which appeared to be more potent than its action on
 xxxg8xxx . the results demonstrated that 4 more potently
inhibited  xxxg138xxx  from rat brain and from guinea pig kidney
than the  xxxg8xxx  from rat brain. it is therefore probable that
 xxxg138xxx  provides the primary site of action of 4 in the
gaba shunt of brain.
from the literature, there is good evidence for inhibition
of  xxxg138xxx  by 15 in vitro, but the mechanism is uncertain.
all three mechanisms namely competitive, non-competitive
and mixed inhibition of  xxxg138xxx  by 15 has been shown in
