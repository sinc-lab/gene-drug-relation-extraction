functional nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps) of folate metabolism genes can influence the methylation of
tumour suppressor genes, thereby potentially impacting on tumour behaviour. to investigate whether such polymorphisms influence
lung cancer survival, we genotyped 14 nssnps mapping to methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ),  xxxg1479xxx 
(mtr),  xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx ); dna methyltransferase (dnmt2), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
( xxxg1473xxx ) and methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (mthfs) in 619 caucasian women with incident disease, 465 with non-small
cell (nsclc) and 154 with small cell lung cancer (sclc). the most significant association detected was with mthfs thr202ala, with
carriers of variant alleles having a worse prognosis (hazard ratio (hr) ¼ 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.14 – 1.94). associations were
also detected between overall survival (os) in sclc and homozygosity for  xxxg1475xxx  222val (hr ¼ 1.92; 1.03 – 3.58) and between os
from nsclc and  xxxg1480xxx  175leu carrier status (hr ¼ 1.36; 1.06 – 1.75). while there is evidence that variation in the folate metabolism
genes may influence prognosis from lung cancer, current data are insufficiently robust to distinguish individual patient outcome.

lung cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide. in the
united kingdom, it accounts for more than 33 000 cancer deaths
each year (cancer research uk). despite improvements in
treatment in recent years, the prognosis from the disease has only
marginally improved with 5-year survival rates for both small
(sclc) and non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), typically being no
better than 15% (jemal et al, 2002). while the major prognostic
determinant in lung cancer is stage at presentation, there is
variability in survival for patients with same-stage disease. hence,
it is advantageous to identify further prognostic markers, which
may aid identification of those patients who will benefit from
therapeutic interventions. furthermore, identifying genes which
influence prognosis has the potential to aid the identification of
pathways that will be targeted for therapeutic interventions.
aberrant dna methylation is recognised as being a common
feature of human neoplasia, cpg island hypermethylation and
global genomic hypomethylation occurring simultaneously in
tumours including lung cancers. moreover, the cellular profile of
dna hypermethylation has been implicated in progression and
metastasis of lung cancer (nakamura et al, 2003; shimamoto et al,
2004).

variants of folate metabolism pathway (figure 1) genes such
as functional polymorphisms of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ), affect methylation of dna and tumour
suppressor genes (kamiya et al, 1998; paz et al, 2002), thereby
potentially impacting on tumour behaviour. this coupled with
the observation that polymorphisms of this pathway can affect the
efficacy of cytotoxic drugs (maring et al, 2005) has provided a
strong rationale for evaluating such variants as prognostic factors.
here, we report the impact of polymorphic variation within the
folate metabolism pathway genes  xxxg1475xxx ,  xxxg1479xxx 
(mtr),  xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx ), dna methyltransferase (dnmt2), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
( xxxg1473xxx ) and methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (mthfs) on
lung cancer prognosis in 619 patients. we based our analysis on
nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps) as
these alter the amino-acid sequence of expressed proteins and are
most likely to have functional consequences.

patients with lung cancer were ascertained through the genetic
lung cancer predisposition study (gelcaps). full details about
the design and conduct of the study can be obtained elsewhere
(matakidou et al, 2005). briefly, patients were recruited through
oncology centres in the uk specializing in the management of lung
cancer. to ensure that data and samples were collected from bona
fide lung cancer cases and avoid issues of bias from survivorship,

demographic characteristics (sex, date of birth, ethnic group, area
of residence and country of birth, smoking history, history of lung
cancer in a first degree relative), treatment and clinical follow-up
were collected from cases using standardized questionnaire and
proformas. the current analysis is based on 619 female patients all
of whom are white caucasians. patient characteristics are detailed
in table 1. ethical approval for the study was obtained from the
london multi-centre research ethics committee (mrec/98/2/67)
in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki. all

polymorphic in caucasians, feasibility of genotyping and established functional impact of the sequence changes. genotyping was
conducted by means of illumina sentrix bead arrays (illumina,
san diego, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer’s protocols
(details available on request).

statistical methods
associations between survival and demographic and clinical
variables were assessed by means of the w2 and fisher’s exact
tests. testing for population substructure was based on examining
the distribution of snp genotypes for evidence of hardy –
weinberg disequilibrium. overall survival (os) of patients was
the end point of the analyses. survival time was calculated from the
date of diagnosis of lung cancer to the date of death. patients who
were not deceased were censored at the date of last contact.
median follow-up time was computed among censored observations only. kaplan – meier survival curves according to genotype
were generated and the homogeneity of the survival curves was
tested using the log-rank test. cox regression analysis (klein and
moeschberger, 1997) was used to estimate hazard ratios (hrs) and
their 95% confidence intervals (ci) while adjusting for radiotherapy and stage. likelihood ratio testing for the inclusion of
covariates and interaction terms was performed to determine the

bioinformatic analysis
we applied two in silico algorithms, polymorphism phenotyping
(polyphen) and the sorting intolerant from tolerant to predict the
putative impact of missense variants on protein function(ng
and henikoff, 2002; ramensky et al, 2002). sorting intolerant from
tolerant and polyphen scores were classified according to the
established criteria (ng and henikoff, 2002; xi et al, 2004).

results
study population and snp genotype distributions
one hundred and fifty-four of the patients (25%) had sclc,
somewhat less than half (43%) presenting with limited disease.
of the 465 patients with nsclc, 57 (13%) had stage i, 68 (15%)
had stage ii, 196 (43%) had stage iii and 130 (29%) had stage iv
disease at diagnosis. the majority of patients with limited stage
sclc had been treated with a combination of radical radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, while all patients received chemotherapy
(table 1). the main treatment modality for sclc patients with
extensive disease was chemotherapy. patients with early stage
nsclc (stage i and ii disease) were mainly treated with surgical
resection of the primary tumour, while about one-third received
chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy. the mainstay treatment
modality of patients with stage iii and iv nsclc was chemotherapy. there were 389 (62.8%) deaths in the cohort. overall the
median survival time (mst) was 16.2 months (range 0.03 – 60.5
months). there were 13 patients with follow-up time less than 1
month, from whom five died. patients with sclc had a mst of
17.8 and 11.1 months, if diagnosed with limited and extensive
disease, respectively. for nsclc, by stage, mst ranged from 11.5
months in stage iv patients to 49.2 months in the stage i group.
as these survival rates are not significantly different to those
documented in audits of lung cancer prognosis (cancer research
uk), there is no evidence that ‘healthy study participant’ selection
will have biased our analyses.

surgery, any chemotherapy and treatment specifically with
platinum-based compounds did not satisfy the proportional
hazards assumption required for the cox model. therefore, we
used a stratified cox model, stratifying on these covariates. stage
at presentation, histology, radiotherapy, smoking, family history
of lung cancer and age at diagnosis were initially included as
covariates and backward stepwise selection procedure was
conducted to cover the most parsimonious model. stage and age
were included as categorical and continuous variables, respectively. other factors were coded as binary variables. factors
significantly influencing patient prognosis were stage at presentation (po104), histology (p ¼ 0.026) and radiotherapy
(p ¼ 0.0042). smoking, family history of lung cancer and age at
diagnosis did not impact on survival.

relationship between snp genotype and prognosis
for most snps genotyped (92%), minor allele frequencies (maf)
were 5% or higher. one snp was however, observed at
comparatively low frequencies (i.e. having maf o5%). there
was no evidence in the data set for population stratification based
on testing the distribution of snp genotypes for hardy – weinberg
disequilibrium. thirteen nssnps in six genes were assayed. only
snps s257t, r415c and  xxxg1802xxx , and snps h595y and k175l, all
mapping to  xxxg1480xxx , were in strong ld (i.e. r2 ¼ 1.0 and r2 ¼ 0.81,
respectively). hence, the relationship between snp haplotype and
prognosis was restricted to this locus.
there was no correlation between the snp genotype and
pathological parameters, (stage and histology), but in view of the
differences in biology of nsclc and sclc we also examined for
relationships between genotypes and prognosis in the two cell
types separately. table 2 details the relationships between snp
genotype and os from lung cancer obtained from cox regression
analysis.
significant associations were identified between polymorphic
variation in mthfs,  xxxg1475xxx  and  xxxg1480xxx . under the cox
proportional hazards model, the hrs for os from all lung cancer
associated with mthfs thr202ala heterozygosity, homozygosity
and carrier status were: 1.53 (95% ci: 1.17 – 2.01), 1.04 (95% ci:
0.38 – 2.84) and 1.49 (95% ci: 1.14 – 1.94), respectively. kaplan –
meier estimates demonstrated that carriers had a shorter mst
than patients with the wild-type genotype (mst of 12.9 and 16.7
months, respectively; p ¼ 0.052; figure 2). the hrs for os from
nsclc associated with mthfs thr202ala heterozygosity, homozygosity and carrier status were 1.4 (95% ci: 1.02 – 1.92), 1.45 (95%
ci: 0.44 – 4.71) and 1.4 (95% ci: 1.06 – 1.91), respectively. the hrs
for os from sclc associated with mthfs thr202ala carrier
status was 1.96 (95% ci: 1.17 – 3.30). for sclc there were too few
homozygotes, hence, these data were pooled with heterozygotes.
variation in  xxxg1475xxx  defined by ala222val appeared to influence
os for sclc in a recessive fashion with hr associated with
heterozygote, homozygote and carrier status being 1.08 (95% ci:
0.70 – 1.68), 1.92 (95% ci: 1.03 – 3.58) and 1.20 (95% ci: 0.79 – 1.82),
respectively. for this group, kaplan – meier estimates showed that
variant homozygotes had a shorter mst than patients with other
genotypes (msts of 10.3 and 14.3 months, respectively; p ¼ 0.025,
figure 2).  xxxg1475xxx  arg594gln influenced os with hr associated
with carrier status being 0.68 (95% ci: 0.46 – 1.00), and 0.60 (95%
ci: 0.37 – 0.95) in all lung cancer and nsclc, respectively. for
nsclc, kaplan – meier estimates showed that variant carriers had
a longer mst than patients with other genotypes (25.4 and 16.2
months, respectively; p ¼ 0.02; figure 1). there was evidence that
carrier status for  xxxg1480xxx  ser175leu is associated with a poorer
prognosis (hr ¼ 1.14; 95% ci: 0.92 – 1.41) albeit borderline
significance in all cancers but significant in nsclc (hr ¼ 1.36;
95% ci: 1.06 – 1.75). for nsclc patients, mst in carriers was
15.9 compared to 19.8 months in patients with other genotypes
(p ¼ 0.09, figure 1). a number of other variants were also

minor allele homozygotes, minor allele homozygote genotypes
were combined with heterozygotes. in addition, to study the
impact of individual snps on survival, we evaluated os as a
function of the number of ‘risk alleles’ carried. in this analysis, risk
was trichotomised into low, medium and high-risk categories.
owing to the exploratory nature of this study, we reported nominal
statistical associations for all analyses. we recognise that examining multiple snps risks identification of false associations.
however, correction for multiple testing may increase the risk of
type ii errors (perneger, 1998). accordingly, we present uncorrected p-values but recognise our exploratory findings require
confirmation in another study. this approach minimises loss of
true positive results but allows false positive results to be identified
(perneger, 1998; cuzick, 1999). to adjust for multiple testing, we
multiplied p-values of each individual test statistic by the number
of snps in the corresponding gene to obtain a genewide p-value,
the global p-value being the product of the genewide p-value and
the number of genes. statistical analyses were undertaken using
s-plus (version 8, insightful corporation, usa). the power to
demonstrate a relationship between snp genotype and os was
estimated using sample size formulae for comparative binomial
trials (farrington and manning, 1990). in all analyses, a p-value of
0.05 was considered statistically significant. to assess the level of
linkage disequilibrium (ld) between snps, we calculated the
pairwise ld measure r2 between markers mapping to the same
gene using the programme phase (stephens et al, 2001) that
implements the monte carlo markov chain procedure to estimate
two-locus haplotype frequencies. this information was used to
investigate the relationship between haplotypes and os.

associated with os (table 2), but none were individually
significant.
evaluating os as a function of the number of ‘risk alleles’
provided no evidence of an interaction between snps (data not
shown). finally, we examined for potential interactive effects
between snps, response to platinum-based chemotherapy and
prognosis. none showed nominally significant interactions at the
5% level.

discussion
major strengths of our study are its large size, the fact that it is
population-based, included only patients with incident disease,
and has involved the systematic follow-up of patients. we are
mindful that it is desirable that studies aimed at identifying
prognostic markers should be conducted within the context of a
clinical trial to minimise bias. although bias from non-uniform
treatment is a potential confounder in studies of some solid
tumours, the management of lung cancer is relatively uniform in
the uk, as there are only a restricted number of effective
chemotherapeutic agents and prognosis is uniformly poor.
support for this assertion is provided by the fact that survival
rates observed in our patient cohort were not different to those
expected. it is therefore unlikely that any spurious influences as a
consequence of study design will have impacted significantly on
our findings. it is well known that the allele frequencies of many
snps vary among different populations. as our analysis was
restricted to white patients, our study findings are unlikely to be
confounded by population stratification. the main limitation of
our study is the ability to pursue an in-depth examination of the
effect of non-genetic factors such as circulating folate levels, which
may interact with genotype in defining the clinical behaviour of
tumours.
despite such limitations in this study, we have observed
significant evidence for associations between survival and variation in  xxxg1475xxx , mthfs and  xxxg1480xxx . our observation that
polymorphic variation in the folate metabolism genes influences
& 2007 cancer research uk

cancer prognosis is not without precedent (alberola et al, 2004).
we fully acknowledge that we have not captured all variation
defined by nssnps mapping to all of the folate metabolism genes
but our selection was restricted to validated snps that could be
robustly genotyped using the analytical platform we employed. for
example, it would have been desirable to have genotyped nssnps
mapping to dnmt1 and dnmt3b, given previously published data
implicating variation in these genes in development and prognosis
of lung cancer (kassis et al, 2006; kim et al, 2006; wang et al,
2006). however, to date only two common (maf 40.05) validated
nssnps map to dnmt1 (ile311val and his97arg) and both
unfortunately had low designability for the genotyping platform we
employed, thereby precluding evaluation.
we evaluated nssnps on the basis that each has the capacity to
directly affect the function of expressed proteins, implying a higher
probability of being directly causally related to susceptibility.
there is good evidence that  xxxg1475xxx  ala222val directly affect the
function of the expressed protein. for snps such as mthfs
thr202ala and  xxxg1480xxx  ser175leu, substitutions are not predicted
to be benign. although such in silico predictions about the
functional consequences of amino-acid changes are not definitive,
these algorithms have been demonstrated in benchmarking studies
to successfully categorise 80% of amino-acid substitutions (savas
et al, 2004; xi et al, 2004).
the nature of our study precluded us from formally evaluating
snps in relation to response to radiotherapy as this was only
administered to a small number of patients. similarly only a small
number of patients did not receive platinum-based chemotherapy
limiting our ability to robustly detect interactions between this
type of therapy, genotype and prognosis. although there may be
differences between nsclc and sclc, which may reflect
differences in biology of the tumour types, our data did not
provide real evidence that folate metabolism variation plays a
major role in defining differences in prognosis between these
tumour types.
in studies of the type we have conducted, there is the issue of
adjustment for multiple comparisons. we assessed 13 polymorphisms in seven genes but because more than one polymorphism

was tested in some genes, the results are not independent. hence,
for mthfs thr202ala, the statistical threshold for global
significance is 0.007.
issues of power are also relevant to the formulation of studies
seeking to identify polymorphic variants influencing cancer
prognosis. the magnitude of any difference in prognosis
associated with individual snps is likely to be at best modest
hence stipulating significance levels of b104 or less to adjust for
multiple testing is inherently unrealistic. for example, for an
analysis to have 80% power to demonstrate a 5% difference in
survival, which is clinically relevant, would require at least 4800
patient samples to be analysed even if the frequency of the at-risk
genotype is 50% stipulating such significance levels. for less
frequent genotypes, samples sizes would be impossibly large. on
this basis the imposition of very stringent p-values (as advocated
in genome-wide case – control studies) to outcome studies is
questionable creating the serious issue of generating a raft of type
ii errors (perneger, 1998).
despite the strong biologic plausibility and consistency with
literature for several individual associations as discussed herein,
some of these associations may be false positives as a result of the
inherent pitfalls of the candidate gene approach. hence, individual
associations reported in this article must inevitably be interpreted
with caution. nevertheless, even for those true associations, it is
unlikely that any individual snp would have sufficient power to
predict clinical outcomes in a disease as complex as cancer. in
this context, combined analyses of two or more snps in the same
pathway are likely to have superior potential to assist in
distinguishing different outcome patterns among patients with

the same stage disease as even 5 – 10% differences in prognosis are
relevant in a disease. furthermore, it is plausible that the impact of
variation in the folate metabolism genes is likely to be best seen in
situations where the pathway plays a major role in defining the
efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in cancers amenable to
treatment with agents such as pyrimidine-antagonists (maring
et al, 2005).
in conclusion, however attractive the notion that polymorphisms of the folate metabolism pathway genes are in defining
cancer prognosis, their role in lung cancer on the basis of our data
is minor at best and they are unlikely to have clinical utility.
