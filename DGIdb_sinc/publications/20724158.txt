background: recent epidemiologic and laboratory studies have suggested that non-steroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) may reduce the risk of breast cancer through inhibition of cyclooxygenase2 (cox-2).
methods: we conducted a caseecontrol study to measure the association between selective cox-2
inhibitors, particularly celecoxib, rofecoxib,  xxxd3481xxx  and non-speciﬁc nsaid subgroups, and breast
cancer risk. between 2003 and 2006, a total of 18,368 incident breast cancer cases were identiﬁed in the
ingenix/lab rx insurance database, which contains clinical encounter and drug prescription data. four
controls per case were randomly selected, matched on age and time in database. odds ratios (or) and
95% conﬁdence intervals (ci) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
results: breast cancer risk was inversely associated with both non-speciﬁc nsaid and selective cox-2
inhibitor use. greater than 12 months’ duration of use of celecoxib at a standard dose (200 mg/day) was
associated with a 16% decrease in breast cancer risk (or ¼ 0.84, 95% ci ¼ 0.73, 0.97). we observed the
greatest risk reduction in association with >2 years of rofecoxib exposure (or ¼ 0.54, 95% ci ¼ 0.37, 0.80).
acetaminophen, a compound with less biological plausibility for chemoprevention, showed no signiﬁcant association with the risk of developing breast cancer.
conclusion: consistent with animal models and laboratory investigations, higher doses of selective cox-2
inhibitors were more protective against breast cancer than non-speciﬁc nsaids. with exposure to
rofecoxib, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, breast cancer risk reduction was appreciable (46%), suggesting
a possible role for selective cox-2 inhibitors in breast cancer prophylaxis.

introduction
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) are commonly
used to treat pain, fever, and inﬂammation. the anti-inﬂammatory
effect of nsaids is mediated primarily through  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2) inhibition, a mechanism also thought likely to reduce
cancer risk by promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting mutagenesis
and angiogenesis through reduced prostaglandin synthesis.1e3 the
production of prostaglandin is dependent on catalysis by cox-2,
which is shown to be over-expressed in approximately one-third of
all breast cancers.4,5
in addition to cox-2, traditional non-speciﬁc nsaids, such as
aspirin and naproxen, also inhibit  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1),
adversely irritating the gastrointestinal tract.4 to counter the
gastrointestinal toxicity of cox-1 inhibition, three cox-2 speciﬁc

inhibitors were introduced between 1998 and 2001 e celecoxib,
rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx .  xxxd3481xxx  and rofecoxib are more highly
cox-2 selective than celecoxib,6 which, in addition to decreasing
prostaglandin synthesis, reduces vascular prostacyclin production.
the latter phenomenon may explain its association with increased
risk of myocardial infarction (mi),7 which resulted in its subsequent
removal from the market in 2004.
both laboratory and epidemiologic studies have shown an
apparent chemo-protective effect of nsaids.8 the evidence for
nsaid prophylaxis is strongest for colorectal cancer, with the fda
recommending celecoxib as an oral adjunct to usual care for the
treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (fap).9,10 with respect
to breast cancer, however, the association is less clear. the results of
previous studies have been mixed, with some concluding that
regular nsaid use is associated with decreased risk of breast cancer,11e19 and others suggesting a null association or an increased
risk.20e26 a fairly recent meta-analysis of 14 studies found that
regular nsaid use was associated with a modestly reduced breast
cancer risk, there being an 18 percent reduction in risk in cohort

v. ashok et al. / the breast 20 (2011) 66e70

studies and a 13 percent reduction in risk in caseecontrol studies.27
however, most of these studies were limited by low statistical power
and had limited nsaid dose and frequency data. moreover, only one
study has evaluated exposure to selective cox-2 inhibitors. therefore, we examined the association between use of selective cox-2
inhibitors and breast cancer risk in a large caseecontrol study nested
in a cohort based on data from a large health claims database, taking
into account dose, frequency, and duration of use, moreover both
cox-2 speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc nsaids were examined.

methods
the ingenix lab/rx insurance databaseô is an administrative
database that contains information on more than 37 million individuals over the time period from january 1, 2000 to june 30, 2006.
the database contains longitudinal patient history, speciﬁc demographic information (sex, age, range of dates in the database),
clinical encounters (diagnosis of diseases and medical procedures
performed, categorized by the international classiﬁcation of
diseases, 9th revision, clinical modiﬁcation (icd-9-cm)), and
speciﬁc drug prescription and pharmaceutical dispensation information (categorized by national drug code, ndc). for the present
study, we identiﬁed 18,368 incident cases of breast cancer between
january 1, 2003 and june 30, 2006. cases were deﬁned as women
above 19 years of age, newly diagnosed between january 1, 2003
and june 30, 2006 with at least 3 years of data in the database prior
to diagnosis (i.e. 3 years of data to determine exposure). a total of 4
controls were matched individually to each case on age (to the
nearest year) and time in the database (to the nearest year). breast
cancer cases were ascertained from clinical encounters data, and an
icd-9-cm code of 174 (with any extension) was used. subjects with
a breast cancer diagnosis within 6 months of starting nsaids were
excluded from the analyses.
exposure was ascertained using national drug codes and brand
names. each selective cox-2 inhibitor was in the database with only
one brand name (e.g. ‘vioxx’ or ‘celebrex’), so they were easily
identiﬁed. non-speciﬁc nsaids had multiple brand names, so
national drug codes were used to ascertain these exposures. acetaminophen has no biologic plausibility as an anti-carcinogenic agent
and has never shown any effect on cancer outcomes, and therefore it
was included in the analysis as a form of internal validation of the
results for the nsaids. dose and duration data on cox-2 speciﬁc
inhibitors (celecoxib, rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx ), non-speciﬁc nsaids,
and acetaminophen were abstracted from the claims data.  xxxd3481xxx  and rofecoxib were withdrawn from the market in october,
2005 and march, 2005, respectively. thus, exposure to these drugs
was truncated on the dates they were withdrawn.
oral contraceptives exposure was classiﬁed as greater than one
year of drug dispensing at least 6 months prior to index date. exact
drugs were based on ‘anatomical therapeutic chemical classiﬁcation system’ group ‘g8a’ corresponding to oral contraceptives.
we used various deﬁnitions of exposure to reﬁne analysis of the
association between nsaid use and breast cancer. in addition to
ever versus never use, we assessed cumulative dose to examine
doseeresponse effects. cumulative dose was deﬁned as the total
number of days of intake of the maximum recommended daily dose
of a speciﬁc nsaid and was calculated using the following formula
based on the dispensing data variables:

cumulative dose ¼

67

for example, the generally accepted maximum dose of celebrex
is 400 mg per day. thus, a person taking two 100 mg pills of celebrex a day for 90 days would have a cumulative dose of
(90 * 2 * 100)/400 ¼ 45. similarly, a person taking four 100 mg pills
of celebrex a day for 45 days would have the same cumulative dose
of this drug.
to examine the effect of regular exposure to nsaids we constructed a “continuous duration” variable. for each exposed individual we calculated the longest continuous (deﬁned as at least 3
days a week of standard dose) use of the drug.
we also assessed the effect of the timing of exposure to nsaids
in relation to the breast cancer diagnosis. exposed individuals were
divided into 3 groups based on when they took most (>70%) of the
drug e 7e12 months prior to diagnosis, 1e2 years prior to diagnosis, or 2e3 years prior to diagnosis. the risk of breast cancer
incidence in these groups was compared to that in those who were
not exposed to nsaids (referent group).
statistical analysis
with a small range of birth years and years in the insurance
database, the theoretical number of unique strata was 410 (5-year
range of time in database  82-year range in ages). because some of
the controls in the 18,368 unique strata from the 4:1 matching had
similar times in the database and similar ages (matching factors),
and hence could also have been controls for cases within other
strata with same values for the matching factors, we pooled the
data into 385 strata.
we assessed the association of nsaid use with the risk of breast
cancer using conditional logistic regression (proc logistic, sas
institute, cary, nc). differences between the baseline characteristics were calculated using the wilcoxon rank sum test (proc
npar1way wilcoxon, sas institute, cary, nc).
results
subjects with breast cancer were generally less likely to have
a history of nsaid use as compared to the controls. (table 2). the
four subgroups of use e non-speciﬁc nsaids, celecoxib, rofecoxib
and  xxxd3481xxx  e showed a reduction in risk of breast cancer. in
analyses of speciﬁc cox-2 inhibitors, all three were found to have
a protective effect on the risk of breast cancer. however, the effect
was stronger for rofecoxib (or ¼ 0.68 95% ci 0.62, 0.74) as
compared to celecoxib (or ¼ 0.86 95% ci 0.81, 0.93),  xxxd3481xxx 
(or ¼ 0.81 95% ci 0.71, 0.92) and any use of non-speciﬁc nsaids
(or ¼ 0.85 95% ci 0.82, 0.88). individuals diagnosed with breast
cancer were signiﬁcantly more likely to have been exposed to oral
contraceptives (table 1).
there was evidence for a doseeresponse effect, as signiﬁcant
trends were found with cumulative dose for non-speciﬁc nsaids,
and for the celecoxib, rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx  subgroup analyses
(all p < .01). continuous exposure was generally associated with
a reduction in risk of breast cancer, and there was some evidence
for a trend in risk reduction with increased duration of continuous
use of non-speciﬁc nsaids, and of celecoxib and rofecoxib (all
p < .01).
reduction in breast cancer risk associated with celecoxib was
observed for subjects taking >70% of the drug 1e2 years and 2e3

years prior to diagnosis, strongest protection occurred in the 1e2
year subgroup. subjects who took most of the drug in the 7e12
months prior to diagnosis did not appear to have any protection
from breast cancer compared with those not exposed to celecoxib.
for non-speciﬁc nsaids, the highest risk reduction was observed
for subjects who took most of their drug 2e3 years prior to diagnosis, followed by those who took >70% of the drug in the 1e2
years prior to diagnosis. this trend was statistically signiﬁcant and
was observed for non-speciﬁc nsaids but not for celecoxib (fig. 1).
discussion
in our large health claims database, women with breast cancer
were less likely to have a history of speciﬁc cox-2 inhibitor and
non-speciﬁc nsaid use compared to controls. evidence relating to
the biologic plausibility of these ﬁndings is accumulating. the
currently favored hypothesis of breast cancer evolution argues that
breast cancer evolves in a slow progression, with the transition
from normal epithelium to invasive breast cancer taking years or
even decades.28 data from animal studies suggest that nsaids
reduce tumor growth rates, rather than prevent mammary oncogenesis. two recent studies examined the effectiveness of celecoxib
in preventing breast tumors associated with increased amounts of
cox-2 protein ( xxxg721xxx  tumors) expression in transgenic mice,
and both studies found lower mammary prostaglandin levels,
lower breast cancer incidence, and a 23% delay in the detection of
breast cancer in celecoxib treated mice.29,30 a more speciﬁc study
of mammary tumor progression in cox-2-expressing highly
metastatic murine mammary tumor cell lines treated separately
with the non-speciﬁc nsaid indomethacin and the selective cox-2
inhibitor ns-398 found reduced tumor progression by inhibiting
tumor-induced angiogenesis (58% reduction), invasiveness (85%
reduction), and tumor cell migration (60% reduction) with both
treatments. the greatest reduction for all three indicators of tumor
progression occurred when the cell lines were treated with ns-398,
supporting the idea that speciﬁc cox-2 inhibitors are more effective than non-speciﬁc nsaids at slowing the growth of the tumor,
thus delaying presentation of breast cancer.31 evidence from the
current study, in conjunction with laboratory and preclinical ﬁndings, supports the hypothesis that cox-2 induction and the overproduction of prostaglandins play a signiﬁcant role in mammary
tumor progression, and that control of this process has strong
potential as a therapeutic modality.
we separated exposure to nsaids into four classes on the
assumption that the selectivity to bind cox-2 over cox-1 will more
greatly reduce the risk of breast cancer, based on the assumption that
cox-2 inhibition and the subsequent reduction in prostaglandin
synthesis is the chief pathway by which nsaids affect breast cancer
risk, with cox-2 selectivity being found from animal models to
follow the trend rofecoxib >  xxxd3481xxx  > celecoxib > non-speciﬁc

nsaids.6 although cox-2 is over-expressed in some breast cancers,
there is also some evidence that non-speciﬁc nsaids and celecoxib
have protective effects unrelated to cox-2 inhibition.32e34 these
direct non-cox-2 targets of celecoxib may also play a role in the
antitumor properties of the drug.35,36
with respect to temporality of drug exposure, highest risk
reduction in the celecoxib subgroup arose when >70% of their
overall dose was taken 1e2 years prior to index date, compared
with 2e3 years for non-speciﬁc nsaid use. this is consistent with
the results of a previous study suggesting selective cox-2 inhibitors
slow breast tumor progression to a greater extent than non-selective nsaids.32
given that selective cox-2 inhibitors were approved only
a decade ago, this is only the second study evaluating selective cox2 inhibitors as an exposure. the ﬁrst found a stronger protective
effect (or ¼ 0.29 ci 0.14e0.59) for selective cox-2 inhibitors
overall. whereas the ﬁndings were only based on 323 incident
cases of breast cancer, that study adjusted for more covariates than
we did (i.e., body mass, parity, menopausal status, family history,
smoking and alcohol intake).37
in general, our ﬁndings for non-speciﬁc nsaids e overall
(or ¼ 0.85) e are similar to those of a meta-analysis of previous
case-control studies, which yielded an or of 0.87.27 many previous
studies that found a null association were based on limited exposure data (no veriﬁable data on dose, frequency and cox-2 speciﬁcity), with the majority looking at multiple cancers and using the
same criteria of exposure for all cancers, often based on infrequent
use (e.g. 7 prescriptions 13e36 months prior to index date).21,24e26
one previous study looked at the association between  xxxd234xxx  (non-speciﬁc nsaid) and breast cancer by er/pr
status. the results showed the inverse association only for hormone
receptor positive (erþ/pr or er-/prþ or erþ/prþ) breast cancers
(or 0.70 ci 0.54e0.91).38 we did not have data on receptor status.
however, future studies should address the association of selective
cox-2 inhibitors with breast cancer risk by er/pr status to better
identify those subjects who might beneﬁt most from chemopreventive medication (prostaglandins stimulate aromatase gene
expression and so stimulate estrogen biosynthesis).
the strengths of our study include a large number of cases,
which allowed us to examine nsaid type, dose, frequency, and
duration of use with substantial statistical power. moreover, our
measures of date, duration, continuity, and strength of drug exposure were based on reliable pharmacy dispensing data. whereas
both cases and controls may have been exposed to over-thecounter nsaids not documented by insurance claims, individuals
already receiving nsaids e our exposed population e at a discounted rate through their insurance provider will likely not
purchase nsaids elsewhere. if anything, our unexposed population

69

may have been taking over-the-counter nsaids, thereby possibly
attenuating our results. the use of medical records to determine
exposure eliminates the possibility of differential selection or recall,
which may have inﬂuenced previous caseecontrol studies.
our data lacked sufﬁcient covariates, restricting our evaluation
and control of potential confounding. data on commonly studied
risk factors for breast cancer (e.g. race, bmi, smoking and alcohol
consumption, family history of breast cancer, parity, age at
menarche, er/pr status), potentially important covariates, were not
included in the database. therefore, it is possible that confounding
by one or more of these factors inﬂuenced our ﬁndings. however,
studies that have shown an inverse association between nsaids
and breast cancer after adjustment for breast cancer risk factors
have tended to show movement of odds ratios away from the null
upon adjustment.11,27
in conclusion, the consistency, magnitude and trend of our data,
and the coherence with laboratory models and previous epidemiologic evidence, suggest that selective cox-2 inhibitors and nonspeciﬁc nsaids have chemopreventive activity against breast
cancer. the use of nsaids in cancer treatment is appealing for its
other palliative properties and ease of use. with respect to the
potential use of cox-2 inhibitors as chemopreventive agents,
however, a better understanding of the risk of cardiovascular
events and the speciﬁcity of the potential protective effects against
breast cancer (e.g., by er/pr status) is needed.
