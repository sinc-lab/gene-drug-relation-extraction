various organic anion transport inhibitors are used experimentally and clinically. probenecid is a conventional and
standard organic anion transport inhibitor experimentally,
but it is used as a uricosuric drug clinically. in addition,
 xxxd3143xxx , developed as an  xxxg81xxx  antagonist
(shimada et al., 1991), was also shown to inhibit organic
anion transport in the basolateral membrane of opossum
kidney cells derived from the american opossum kidney (nagai et al., 1999). on the other hand, betamipron and  xxxd1693xxx  are administered in combination with carbapenem
antibiotics, panipenem, and imipenem, respectively (birnbaum et al., 1985; shiba et al., 1991). betamipron inhibits
the uptake of panipenem and imipenem into proximal tubule
cells (hirouchi et al., 1994). on the other hand, imipenem is
degraded by human renal  xxxg649xxx  and therefore
this study was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the ministry of
education, sports, science, and technology (11671048, 11694310, and
13671128), the science research promotion fund of the japan private school
promotion foundation, and the fund for research on health sciences focusing
on drug innovation from the japan health sciences foundation.

contrast, probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx , and betamipron, but not  xxxd1693xxx , inhibited  xxxg2109xxx -mediated  xxxd2046xxx  (es) uptake.
kinetic analyses revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. the ki value of probenecid for  xxxg2114xxx  was 766 ␮m,
whereas those of probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx , and betamipron for
 xxxg2109xxx  were 54.9, 20.7, and 502 ␮m, respectively. these results suggest that probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx , and betamipron
could inhibit  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake in vitro, whereas probenecid alone could inhibit the  xxxg2114xxx -mediated pgf2␣ uptake.
comparing the ki values with the therapeutically relevant concentrations of unbound inhibitors in the plasma, probenecid
alone was predicted to inhibit  xxxg2109xxx -mediated organic anion
transport in vivo.

must be administered in combination with  xxxd1693xxx , a  xxxg649xxx  inhibitor, to prevent loss of antimicrobial
activity in urine and limit potential nephrotoxicity associated
with renal metabolism (craig, 1997).
in our previous study, we elucidated the interaction of
human  xxxg2113xxx  ( xxxg2113xxx ) and  xxxg2115xxx 
with organic anion transport inhibitors including probenecid,
 xxxd3143xxx , betamipron, and  xxxd1693xxx  (takeda et al., 2001).
thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the interaction of  xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx  with these organic anion
transport inhibitors using cells derived from the second portion of the proximal tubule (s2) from mice stably expressing
 xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx  (s2  xxxg2114xxx  and s2  xxxg2109xxx , respectively).

abstract
the organic anion transport system is involved in the tubular
excretion and reabsorption of various drugs and substances.
the purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of
various organic anion transport inhibitors on renal organic anion
transport using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human
 xxxg2114xxx  ( xxxg2114xxx ) and  xxxg2109xxx . immunohistochemical analysis revealed that  xxxg2114xxx  is localized to the
basolateral side of the proximal tubule in the kidney.  xxxg2114xxx 
mediated a time- and concentration-dependent increase in
prostaglandin f2␣ (pgf2␣) uptake. the organic anion transport
inhibitors used for this study were probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx  ( xxxd3143xxx ), betamipron, and  xxxd1693xxx . probenecid, but not  xxxd3143xxx , betamipron, and  xxxd1693xxx , significantly inhibited  xxxg2114xxx -mediated pgf2␣ uptake. in

amounts of basal to apical and apical to basal transepithelial transport of d-[3h]mannitol were similar; thus, s2  xxxg2114xxx  and s2  xxxg2109xxx 
cells were determined to be leaky. in addition, vertical sections of s2
 xxxg2114xxx  and s2  xxxg2109xxx  stained with polyclonal antibodies against
 xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx , respectively, showed that the subcellular localization of proteins for  xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx  was mainly on the cell
membrane (unpublished observation). both the basolateral and apical portions of the membrane showed positive staining. therefore,
the cells were cultured on a solid support for use in the following
experiments.
immunohistochemical analysis of  xxxg2114xxx  protein in human kidney. human kidney tissues were collected previously from
patients with urethral tract carcinoma after giving informed consent. for the generation of the antibody against  xxxg2114xxx , rabbits were
immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthesized
peptides, cslqeeempmkqvqn, corresponding to cysteine and
the 14 amino acids of the cooh terminus of  xxxg2114xxx . the igg
fraction of the polyclonal antibodies for the synthesized peptide was
purified from the serum of immunized rabbits using a protein a
column.
light-microscopic analysis of the  xxxg2114xxx  protein was performed as
previously described (tojo et al., 1999). briefly, waxed sections of the
human kidney cortex (2 ␮m) were cut and stained by the labeled
streptavidin-biotin method. after dewaxing, the sections were incubated with 3% h2o2 for 15 min and then with blocking serum for 15
min. the sections were then incubated with a polyclonal antibody
against  xxxg2114xxx  (1:500 dilution) for 2 h. the sections were rinsed with
tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% tween-20 and incubated with
the biotinylated secondary antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin
(dako, glostrup, denmark) for 1 h. after rinsing with tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% tween-20, the sections were incubated for 30
min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin solution.
horseradish peroxidase labeling was detected using a peroxidase
substrate solution with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm; dojindo laboratories, kumamoto, japan). the sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin before examination under a light microscope.
uptake experiments. uptake experiments were performed as
previously described (takeda et al., 1999). the cells were seeded in
24-well tissue culture plates at a cell density of 1 ⫻ 105 cells/well.
after a 2-day culture, they were washed three times with dulbecco’s
modified phosphate-buffered saline solution (containing 137 mm
nacl, 3 mm kcl, 8 mm na2hpo4, 1 mm kh2po4, 1 mm cacl2, and
0.5 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4), and then preincubated in the same solution
in a water bath at 37°c for 10 min. s2  xxxg2114xxx  cells were incubated in
a solution containing 5 nm [3h]pgf2␣ for use in time course experiments and 50 nm [3h] pgf2␣ for use in inhibition experiments. s2
 xxxg2109xxx  cells were incubated in a solution containing 50 nm [3h]es
for use in the inhibition experiments. the uptake was stopped by the
addition of ice-cold dulbecco’s modified phosphate-buffered saline,
and the cells were washed three times with the same solution. the
cells in each well were lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.1 n sodium hydroxide
and 2.5 ml of aquasol-2, and radioactivity was determined using a
␤-scintillation counter (lsc-3100; aloka,, tokyo, japan).
kinetic analysis. after the preincubation as described above, s2
 xxxg2114xxx  and s2  xxxg2109xxx  cells were incubated in a solution containing
[3h]pgf2␣ or [3h]es at different concentrations in the absence or
presence of various inhibitors at 37°c for 20 s (for  xxxg2114xxx ) or 2 min
(for  xxxg2109xxx ). probenecid and  xxxd1693xxx  were dissolved in h2o,
whereas  xxxd3143xxx  and betamipron were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx . the final concentration of  xxxd1896xxx  was adjusted to
less than 0.1%, which did not affect the  xxxg2114xxx - and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated organic anion uptake in our system. based on the [3h]pgf2␣
and [3h]es uptake under each condition, double reciprocal plot
analyses were performed as previously described (apiwattanakul et
al., 1999). for accurate analysis, the transformed data points were
analyzed using weighted linear regression, with a weighting factor of
1/y or 1/y2. when the inhibition was competitive, the ki values were
calculated based on the following equation: ki ⫽ the concentration of

cell culture and establishment of s2  xxxg2114xxx  and s2  xxxg2109xxx .
s2 cells, derived from transgenic mice harboring the temperaturesensitive simian virus 40 large t-antigen gene, were established as
described previously by us (hosoyamada et al., 1996). the full-length
cdna of  xxxg2114xxx  was isolated by screening the human kidney cdna
library using rat  xxxg2114xxx  cdna (sekine et al., 1998) as a probe (genbank accession number: af210455). the amino acids sequence homology between  xxxg2114xxx  and rat  xxxg2114xxx  is 77%. the full-length cdnas
of  xxxg2114xxx  and  xxxg2109xxx  (cha et al., 2000) were subcloned into pcdna
3.1 (invitrogen), a mammalian expression vector. s2  xxxg2114xxx  and s2
 xxxg2109xxx  were obtained by transfecting s2 cells with pcdna3.1hoat2 and pcdna3.1- xxxg2109xxx  coupled with psv2neo, a neomycin
resistance gene, using tfx-50 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. s2 cells transfected with pcdna3.1 lacking an insert and
psv2neo were designated as s2 pcdna 3.1 and used as the control
(mock cells). these cells were grown in a humidified incubator at
33°c and under 5% co2 using ritc 80-7 medium containing 5%
fetal bovine serum, 10 ␮g/ml transferrin, 0.08 u/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml
recombinant  xxxg681xxx , and 400 ␮g/ml  xxxd2191xxx . the
cells were subcultured in a medium containing 0.05% trypsin-edta
solution (containing 137 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 5.5 mm glucose, 4
mm nahco3, 0.5 mm edta, and 5 mm hepes, ph 7.2) and used
for 25 to 35 passages. clonal cells were isolated using a cloning
cylinder and screened by determining the optimal substrate for each
transporter [i.e., [14c]salicylate for  xxxg2114xxx  (sekine et al., 1998) and
[3h]es for  xxxg2109xxx  (cha et al., 2000)]. s2  xxxg2109xxx  exhibited a doseand time-dependent increase in the uptake of es. when s2  xxxg2114xxx 
and s2  xxxg2109xxx  cells were cultured on permeable support (transwell
chambers; coster, cambridge, ma) and incubated in a solution containing d-[3h]mannitol on the apical or the basolateral side, the

mal tubule. the process of secreting organic anions through
the proximal tubule cells is achieved via unidirectional transcellular transport involving the uptake of organic anions
into the cells from the blood across the basolateral membrane, followed by extrusion across the brush-border membrane into the proximal tubule fluid (pritchard and miller,
1993). recently, cdna-encoding transporters mediating renal organic anion transport have been successively cloned,
including oat1 (sekine et al., 1997; reid et al., 1998;

vitro. the maximum steady-state plasma concentration and
unbound fraction of probenecid were reported to be 170 ␮m
(nierenberg, 1983) and 11.0% (dayton et al., 1963), respectively. thus, the maximum steady-state concentration of unbound probenecid in the plasma is estimated to be approximately 18.7 ␮m. since the therapeutically relevant plasma
concentrations of a drug is thought to be within 5-fold of the
maximum steady-state plasma concentration of a drug
(zhang et al., 2000), the therapeutically relevant concentration of unbound probenecid in the plasma is thought to be
93.5 ␮m. in addition, since the unbound drug could be filtered through the glomerulus, the concentration of unbound
probenecid with the tubular fluid in the apical side of the
proximal tubule would be within 93.5 ␮m. based on these
observations, since the ki value of probenecid for hoat2mediated pgf2␣ uptake and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake
were 766 and 54.9 ␮m, respectively (table 1), it was predicted that probenecid could inhibit the reabsorption of organic anions by  xxxg2109xxx  on the apical side of the proximal
tubule in vivo.
 xxxd3143xxx  is selective and is the most potent adenosine a1
receptor antagonist known to date (suzuki et al., 1992). in
animal studies, this compound was shown to have diuretic
activity and renal-protective effect against cephaloridine-induced nephrotoxicity (mizumoto et al., 1993; nagashima et
al., 1994). however, this compound was excluded from clinical development based on the results of a phase ii trial study,
which showed that this compound did not exert sufficient
diuretic action (k. hakko and k. co, unpublished observation). in this study,  xxxd3143xxx  was shown to inhibit hoat4mediated es uptake but not  xxxg2114xxx -mediated pgf2␣ uptake
in vitro. based on the rank order of the ki values of various
inhibitors shown in table 1,  xxxd3143xxx  was the most potent
inhibitor of  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake. thus, it was suggested that  xxxd3143xxx  could be a powerful pharmacological
agent for analyzing  xxxg2109xxx -mediated organic anion transport in vitro. however, the ki values of  xxxd3143xxx  for hoat4mediated pgf2␣ uptake (20.7 ␮m) were much higher than
the maximum plasma concentration of  xxxd3143xxx  in a healthy
volunteer [i.e., 0.196 ␮m ( xxxd3143xxx  product brochure; kyowa
hakko kogyo co.) (more than 3-fold; zhang et al., 1998)].
thus, it was predicted that this compound would exhibit no
significant inhibitory effects on  xxxg2109xxx -mediated organic anion uptake in vivo.
betamipron significantly inhibited es uptake by  xxxg2109xxx 
but not pgf2␣ uptake by  xxxg2114xxx  in vitro. however, the ki

(kusuhara et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001),  xxxg2109xxx  (cha et al.,
2000), oat-k1 (saito et al., 1996), oat-k2 (masuda et al.,
1999), organic anion-transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ) (jacquemin et al., 1994),  xxxg2164xxx  (noe et al., 1997), oatp3 (abe et
al., 1998),  xxxg15xxx  ( xxxg15xxx )
(leier et al., 2000) and human-type i sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter (npt1) (uchino et al., 2000).
among them,  xxxg2113xxx  and  xxxg2115xxx  are thought to be the major
oats responsible for the basolateral uptake of various organic anions (hosoyamada et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001).
 xxxg2109xxx , localized to the apical side of the proximal tubule
(babu et al., 2002), was reported to mediate the transport of
various anionic drugs, including para-aminohippuric acid
(pah), es, methotrexate, and ochratoxin a (cha et al., 2000).
at first, we characterized the localization and functional
properties of  xxxg2114xxx . immunohistochemically,  xxxg2114xxx  was
shown to be localized to the basolateral side of the proximal
tubule. although salicylate was found to be the best substrate for rat  xxxg2114xxx  (sekine et al., 1998), the background
uptake by mock cells was high (unpublished observation). in
the current study, we found that pgf2␣ was the better substrate for  xxxg2114xxx , whereas the background uptake by mock
cells was much lower.  xxxg2114xxx  mediated a time- and dosedependent increase in pgf2␣ uptake. based on these observations, we used pgf2␣ as a substrate to elucidate the interaction of  xxxg2114xxx  with various organic anion transport
inhibitors. in addition, since  xxxg2113xxx ,  xxxg2114xxx , and  xxxg2115xxx 
(hosoyamada et al., 1999; cha et al., 2001) are localized to
the basolateral side of the proximal tubule, the functional
difference among these transporters should therefore be elucidated.
probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx , and betamipron, but not  xxxd1693xxx ,
significantly inhibited es uptake by  xxxg2109xxx , whereas probenecid alone inhibited the  xxxg2114xxx -mediated pgf2␣ uptake.
these results are in contrast to the previous results that
probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx , betamipron, and  xxxd1693xxx  significantly inhibited pah uptake by  xxxg2113xxx  and es uptake by
 xxxg2115xxx  (takeda et al., 2001). however, the rank order of the
inhibitory effects on  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake (i.e., kw3902 ⬎ probenecid ⬎ betamipron) was the same as that for
 xxxg2113xxx -mediated pah uptake and  xxxg2115xxx -mediated es uptake (takeda et al., 2001).
probenecid has been widely used to analyze organic anion
transport systems. in the current study, probenecid was
shown to inhibit organic anion uptake mediated by hoat2mediated pgf2␣ uptake and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake in

much higher than the therapeutically relevant concentration
of unbound betamipron in the plasma (25.5 ␮m) (shiba et al.,
1991; zhang et al., 2000). these results suggest that betamipron exerts no significant inhibitory effects on hoat4mediated es transport in vivo.
in the current study,  xxxd1693xxx  was found to have no significant inhibitory effects on  xxxg2114xxx -mediated pgf2␣ uptake
and  xxxg2109xxx -mediated es uptake. in contrast,  xxxd1693xxx  significantly inhibited  xxxg2113xxx -mediated pah uptake and
 xxxg2115xxx -mediated es uptake in vitro, whereas it was predicted that  xxxd1693xxx  exhibits significant inhibitory effects on
 xxxg2113xxx - but not  xxxg2115xxx -mediated organic anion uptake in
vivo (takeda et al., 2001).
in addition to the hoats used in the current study, it is
important to understand the interaction of apical transporters mediating organic anion transport (i.e., oat-k1, oatk2,  xxxg2163xxx ,  xxxg15xxx , and npt1) with various organic anion
inhibitors (inui et al., 2000). however, these topics are beyond the scope of this study, and further study should be
performed to elucidate them.
in conclusion, the results suggest that in vitro  xxxg2114xxx 
interacts with only probenecid, whereas  xxxg2109xxx  interacts
with probenecid,  xxxd3143xxx , and betamipron. in addition, by
comparing the ki values of the inhibitors with their therapeutically relevant concentrations of unbound inhibitors in
the plasma, it was predicted that  xxxg2109xxx -mediated organic
anion uptake would be inhibited by probenecid in vivo,
whereas none would inhibit  xxxg2114xxx -mediated organic anion
uptake in vivo. the cells used in this study would serve as a
good tool to characterize newly developed organic anion
transport inhibitors.
