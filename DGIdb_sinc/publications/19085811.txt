over the past several years, numerous studies
have demonstrated that diabetes mellitus is one
of the most crucial risk factors for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases (cvd), and subsequent sudden death [1–3]. although the precise
mechanism(s) are still unclear, hyperglycemia
and insulin resistance are strongly associated
with the various pathological changes [4–9].
therefore, adequate antidiabetic treatment is
required to reduce the mortality and morbidity
rates in diabetic patients.
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (alpha-gis) are novel antidiabetic agents that have been developed for the
treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia, one of
the most common abnormalities in early type 2
diabetic patients [10]. the agents competitively
and reversibly inhibit the intestinal alpha-glucosidase and subsequently suppress carbohydrate
digestion and absorption, serving to reduce dietary hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. chiasson et al. reported that treatment with
acarbose, one of the alpha-gis, can reduce the occurrence of type2 diabetes by 36 % in subjects with

the artery was removed on day 29. compared
with the area ratio of the neointima/media in
fatty rats without treatment, those in fatty rats
with  xxxd2644xxx  and lean rats without treatment
were significantly decreased to 80 %. the administration of  xxxd2644xxx  significantly decreased the
levels of plasma glucose, glycoalbumin and highsensitivity  xxxg520xxx , and elevated the
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level in fatty
rats. these findings suggest that  xxxd2644xxx  could be
eﬀective for the suppression of atherogenic outcomes in diabetic wistar fatty rat, suggesting that
the agent may have clinical benefits and contribute to prevent diabetic macroangiopathy.

impaired glucose tolerance (igt) in the study to
prevent noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(stop-niddm) trial [11]. interestingly, in the
stop-niddm trial, chiasson et al. also showed
that treating igt subjects with acarbose is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of
cvd and hypertension [12], and that the agent
slows the progression of intima-media thickness
(imt) in igt subjects for more than 3 years [13].
in addition, other investigators demonstrated
that intervention with acarbose prevents myocardial infarction and cvd even in type2 diabetic
patients in meta-analysis of seven long-term
studies [14]. as for another alpha-gi,  xxxd3524xxx  is
recently reported to reduce the progression of
imt in type2 diabetic patients for 3 years [15].
however, although treatment with alpha-gis might
be beneficial for the prevention of cvd clinically, the precise mechanisms whereby the
agents can aﬀect the atherogenic outcomes are
not fully understood. thus, further study is
warranted to evaluate the inhibitory eﬀects of
alpha-gis on the process occurring early in diabetic
atherogenesis.

materials
 xxxd2644xxx  was supplied by sanwa kagaku kenkyusho co., ltd.
(nagoya, japan). purified high-fat diet containing 45 % kcal as fat,
35 % kcal as carbohydrate, and 20 % kcal as protein (no. d12451)
[23] was obtained from research diets, inc. (new brunswick, nj,
usa). a 2f forgaty balloon catheter was purchased from baxter
(santa ana, ca, usa). the following items were also purchased:
antibodies specific for an anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin (sma)
from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa) and a cd68 (ed1) from bma
biomedicals (augst, switzerland); an avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex (abc) kit from vectastains (vector laboratories, ca,
usa); lucica® ga-l, for measurement of glycoalbumin, from
asahi kasei pharma (tokyo, japan); a polycarbonate filter, for
measurement of cell migration, from neuro probe, inc (gaithersburg, md, usa); elisa kits for immunoreactive insulin (iri), leptin, and  xxxg357xxx  from wako pure chemical (osaka, japan);

ca, usa), and sigma.

balloon catheterization
twelve-week-old male wistar fatty and lean rats were divided
into control and  xxxd2644xxx -treated groups, and fed the high-fat
diet for 29 days. in the  xxxd2644xxx -treated group, 40 mg of the agent
was mixed with 100 g of the above high-fat diet, as described
previously [19], and age-matched rats fed the high-fat diet with-

out the agent were used as the respective controls. the amount
of food intake in each rat was measured daily for 29 days, and
plasma glucose was measured  xxxd2274xxx -day intervals. balloon catheterization in the left common carotid artery was performed on
day 15 with a 2f forgaty balloon catheter, as reported previously
[24, 25]. after 14 days, the balloon-injured arteries were rapidly
removed for histological analyses. blood samples were taken
from the inferior vena cava on the day of sacrifice to measure the
required parameters.

histological analyses
the procedure was performed as described previously [24, 25].
the left common carotid arteries were rapidly removed and
divided into four cross-sectional pieces at 3 mm intervals for histological analyses. the right common carotid arteries in all rats
were removed to measure intact medial areas. cross-sections
with the fixed tissue samples were stained with elastica-masson. then, the neointimal area, measured from the internal elastic lamina to the luminal surface, and the medial layer of each
section were calculated using a high-resolutional ccd camera
(olympus, tokyo, japan) and a microscopic image analyzing system, analysis® (seika, tokyo, japan), providing the ratio of the
neointimal area to the medial area (i/m ratio), as reported previously.
immunohistological stainings were performed with an anti-alphasma antibody, for the detection of vascular smooth muscle cell
(vsmc)-specific structural protein, or an anti-ed1 antibody, for
the detection of rat monocytes/macrophages, diluted to 1:1 000
with pbs containing 0.2 % bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa, sigma),
and were developed using the abc method.

measurement of blood pressure and heart rate
the hypotensive eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  was examined in all ballooninjured rats. systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate
were measured by the tail-cuﬀ method with an ultrasound
device (mk-2000, muromachi kikai, tokyo, japan) before treatment and 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 days, as described previously [25].

cell culture
cultured vsmcs were harvested from the aortae of male 12week-old wistar fatty and lean rats by the medial explant technique and cultured in dmem containing 10 % fbs as described
previously [26]. cells within 5 passages were used for the following studies.

growth assay in vsmc
vsmcs were prepared as mentioned above and starved with
dmem containing 0.2 % bsa for 24 h. then, the media were aspirated and cultured in dmem containing 5 % fbs with vehicle and
various concentrations (final concentrations: 10 − 5, 10 − 4, and
10 − 3 m) of  xxxd2644xxx  solubilized in water. after incubation for the
indicated number of days (0, 1, or 3 days), the media were aspirated, and the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of a mixture of 0.5 %
sds and 0.5 n naoh. after neutralizing the solution with 500 mul
of 1 n hcl, the measurement of total cellular protein content was
performed by the method as described previously [24]. these
media were replaced every 24 h during this experiment

migration assay
the migration of vsmcs was assayed by a modification of
boyden’s chamber method using a polycarbonate filter with a

recently, as a new alpha-gi, n-hydroxyethyl- xxxd1955xxx 
( xxxd2644xxx ), is clinically used for the treatment of type2 diabetic patients [16, 17]. the agent can also reduce the glycogenolytic rate of liver and skeletal muscle by inhibiting the
alpha-1,6-glucosidase glycogen debranching enzyme [16, 18]. in
contrast, unlike other alpha-gis,  xxxd2644xxx  is well-absorbed and circulates in its original form [19]. several investigators have
shown that the agent improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant obese rats [19, 20], and that
reduces myocardial apoptosis by attenuating production of
hydroxy radicals and suppressing the elevation of the bax
protein in rabbits [21]. subsequently, these reports suggest
that  xxxd2644xxx  might be more beneficial for the treatment of
diabetic patients than other alpha-gis.
therefore, in this study, we evaluated the eﬃcacy of  xxxd2644xxx 
on the changes of atherogenic outcomes, including ballooninjured carotid arterial neointimal thickening and chronic
inflammatory responses, by using high-fat fed male wistar
fatty rats (fa/fa), a genetically established obese-hyperglycemic animal model for type2 diabetes, and their littermates
(wistar lean rats, fa/?) [22].

pore of 8.0 mum diameter [27]. vsmcs were trypsinized and suspended at a concentration of 5.0 × 105 cells/ml in dmem with
bsa at 1 mg/ml. then, the cell suspension was placed in the
upper chamber and dmem containing  xxxd292xxx  at 5 ng/ml in the
lower chamber. in the experiments, various concentrations (final
concentrations: 10 − 5, 10 − 4, and 10 − 3 m) of  xxxd2644xxx  were added
in the culture medium and preincubated at 37 ° c for 30 min.
then, the chamber was incubated at 37 ° c for 6 h. the filter was
removed and vsmcs on the upper side of the filter were scraped
oﬀ. then, vsmcs that had migrated to the lower side of the filter
were fixed in methanol, stained with hematoxylin and eosin,
and counted by light microscopy ( × 100) for quantitation of
migration. migration activity was expressed at the mean number
of migrated cells seen in four diﬀerent fields.

other measurements
plasma glucose and serum lipids were measured by a glucose
oxidase method and an enzymatic method and/or particleenhanced immunonephrometric assay, respectively. atherogenic
index was calculated using the values of total cholesterol (t-cho)
and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) as follows:
atherogenic index = (t-cho − hdl-c)/hdl-c.

in addition, hormones and proinflammatory cytokines were
examined by the respective elisa kits according the manufacturer’s instructions.

statistical analysis
results were expressed as mean ± sem. statistical significance
was estimated by one-way anova for the comparison of several
groups, and the diﬀerences were considered to be significant at
p < 0.05.

results
&
eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on the changes of body weight,
glucose, and lipid metabolism
no rats died during the 29-day experimental run. in wistar fatty
rats, treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  slightly but insignificantly
decreased the body weight level on days 15 and 29 (䊉䉴 fig. 1a).
in contrast, the postprandial plasma glucose level in miglitoltreated fatty rats was significantly decreased on day 29 compared with that in untreated fatty rats, but not in lean rats on the
same day (䊉䉴 fig. 1b). although the amount of food intake of
fatty rats was higher than that of lean rats, the agent did not
aﬀect the amount in the respective rats (data not shown).

data are mean ± sem (n = 8). ( − ): untreated group;  xxxd2644xxx : group treated with 40 mg of  xxxd2644xxx  in 100 g diet; ppg: postprandial plasma glucose; ga: glycoalbumin;
iri: immunoreactive insulin; tg: triglycerides; t-cho: total cholesterol; hdl-c: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; a.i.: atherogenic index [(t-cho-hdl-c)/hdl-c].

at euthanasia, without  xxxd2644xxx , the levels of plasma glucose,
glycoalbumin, iri, triglycerides (tg), t-cho, and atherogenic
index in fatty rats were significantly higher than those in lean
rats. in contrast, the level of hdl-c in fatty rats was significantly
lower than that in lean rats. in fatty rats, treatment with  xxxd2644xxx 
significantly decreased the levels of plasma glucose and glycoalbumin, and elevated the level of hdl-c, although the agent did
not aﬀect these levels in lean rats. on the other hand, treatment
with  xxxd2644xxx  did not aﬀect the level of systolic and/or diastolic
blood pressure of rats (table 1).

eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on i/m ratio on the left carotid artery
after balloon catheterization
the thickened neointimal layers in the left common carotid
arteries consisted of abundant infiltrated cells and the intercellular matrix in elastica-masson staining. treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  resulted in a distinct change in the size of intimal thickening
in fatty rats even in such a short duration (䊉䉴 fig. 2a). compared
with the i/m ratio in untreated fatty rats, those in fatty rats with
 xxxd2644xxx  and untreated lean rats were significantly lower and
decreased to 83 % and 63 %, while that in  xxxd2644xxx -treated lean
rats was not changed (䊉䉴 fig. 2b). in contrast, there was no difference in the area of the medial layer of catheterized and intact
common carotid arteries.
immunohistological staining with the anti-alpha-sma antibody
showed that diﬀusely positive immunoreactivities completely
occupied the thickened neointimal layers of all preparations
(䊉䉴 fig. 2c). these areas were equivalent to the values of i/m
ratio because of their wide distribution in the thickened neointimal layers. in contrast, immunohistological staining with the
anti-ed1 antibody showed markedly less immunoreactivity in
the thickened neointimal layers. under high magnification, the
ed1 immunoreactivity was sporadically detected in the thickened neointimal layers, and the number of ed1-positive cells
was under 10 in each cross-section. subsequently, we could not
observe any significant diﬀerence in four groups (data not
shown). these findings demonstrated that the thickened neointimal layers in the experiment were composed of proliferated and
migrated vsmcs and that the amount of vsmcs in those layers
was clearly attenuated by the treatment with  xxxd2644xxx .

eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on the changes of adipocytokines and
chronic inflammatory responses
regarding hormones and proinflammatory cytokines, without
 xxxd2644xxx , the levels of  xxxg357xxx  and leptin were significantly higher
in fatty rats than in lean rats. on the other hand, treatment with
 xxxd2644xxx  slightly but insignificantly decreased the  xxxg357xxx  level in
fatty rats. in lean rats, the agent did not cause any change in the
parameters (table 2).
in addition, we further examined the eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on the
change of hs-crp in fatty and lean rats. interestingly, similar to
the result of i/m ratio, the hs-crp level in untreated fatty rats
was 2.5-fold higher than that in untreated lean rats. in contrast,
treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  significantly decreased the hs-crp level
to 72 % in fatty rats, although the agent did not aﬀect the level in
lean rats (䊉䉴 fig. 3).

eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on fbs-induced cell growth and pdgfbb-induced cell migration in vsmcs from wistar fatty
and lean rats
to characterize the eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on vsmc growth and migration in vitro, we examined the changes of fbs-induced total cellular protein concentration and  xxxd292xxx -induced migration
activity in cultured vsmcs from wistar fatty and lean rats. the
total cellular protein concentrations in vsmcs from both fatty
and lean rats were gradually increased by stimulation with 5 %
fbs, and the values in fatty rats were significantly higher than
those in lean rats on days 1 and 3. however, we could not observe
any change of vsmc growth in either fatty or lean rats by treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  (䊉䉴 fig. 4a).
in addition, without any stimulation, the value of migration
activity in vsmcs from fatty rats significantly increased compared with that from lean rats, and these levels were significantly elevated by stimulation with  xxxd292xxx . however,  xxxd2644xxx 
did not aﬀect these  xxxd292xxx -induced vsmc migration activities
in either fatty or lean rats (䊉䉴 fig. 4b). therefore, these results
indicate that  xxxd2644xxx  itself does not have a direct inhibitory
eﬀect on vsmc growth or migration.

discussion
&
in this study, we have clearly demonstrated that  xxxd2644xxx , one of
alpha-gis, not only suppresses neointimal thickening in a balloon-

injured artery but also improves glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammatory responses, especially in
diabetic wistar fatty rats. these results suggest that the selective

inhibition of carbohydrate absorption by alpha-gis is beneficial for
preventing the development of diabetic macroangiopathy.
substantial evidence has established that diabetes mellitus is
one of the most crucial risk factors for atherosclerosis [1–3].
although the precise mechanism(s) are still unclear, glucose and
its metabolites possibly mediate their adverse eﬀects by altering
the various intracellular signal transduction pathways in vascu-

lar wall cells. some changes, especially in vsmcs, include
increases in contractility, cellular proliferation, migration, and
extracellular matrix production, which are abnormal in a diabetic condition [28]. subsequently, several hypotheses, such as
hyperosmolarity [29], advanced glycation end-products [30],
oxidant formation [31], abnormality of sorbitol and myo-inositol metabolism [32], and diacylglycerol-protein kinase c (pkc)
activation [33], have been proposed to explain the various pathological changes induced by hyperglycemia in vasculature.
first, we examined the eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  to determine whether
the agent could suppress the rat neointimal thickening in left
common carotid artery induced by balloon catheterization or
improve glucose intolerance and/or dyslipidemia in high-fat fed
wistar fatty and lean rats. on day 15, we could not observe any
diﬀerence in the plasma glucose level between untreated and
 xxxd2644xxx -treated fatty rats (䊉䉴 fig. 1b). although the precise
mechanism(s) remains unclear, it is likely that the reason may
result from the characteristics of male fatty rats, that is, since the
plasma glucose level in male fatty rats is remarkably elevated
from 10-week-old to 14-week-old (unpublished data), the dosage of  xxxd2644xxx  we adopted in this study may not be suﬃcient.
however, similar to other reports [16–20], treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  could ameliorate glucose intolerance in fatty rats at the end
of this study (table 1 and 䊉䉴 fig. 1b), suggesting that the continuous suppression of carbohydrate digestion and absorption by
 xxxd2644xxx  can improve postprandial hyperglycemia without any
change of food intake. in addition, as in the previous reports of
other alpha-gis [11, 15], treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  increased the hdlc level in fatty rats (table 1). the result suggests that the improve-

ment of lipid profile might contribute to the prevention of
atherosclerosis, since hdl-c by itself has been clarified to contain atheroprotective properties, including antioxidation, antiinflammation, antithrombic eﬀects, and endotherial stabilization
[34].
notably, even in such a short duration, treatment with  xxxd2644xxx 
could decrease the values of the i/m ratio induced by balloon
catheterization to 80 % in fatty rats, although those in nondiabetic lean rats were not changed by treatment with the agent
(䊉䉴 fig. 2a,b). as reported previously [24–26], since the ballooninjured neointimal thickening consisted of vsmcs, treatment
with  xxxd2644xxx  could result in the reduction of the amount of
vsmcs in the thickened neointimal layers (䊉䉴 fig. 2c). we further examined the direct eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on cell growth and
migration in cultured vsmcs using the methods of growth assay
and a modification of boyden’s chamber as described previously
[24, 27]. however, the agent itself did not aﬀect vsmc growth or
migration even in a high concentration (䊉䉴 fig. 4a,b). subsequently, it is likely that both hyperglycemia and chronic inflammatory responses induced by diabetes are strong enough to
develop the balloon-injured neointimal thickening, and that the
amelioration of postprandial hyperglycemia, insulin resistance,
and dyslipidemia by  xxxd2644xxx  might be suﬃcient to reduce the
amount of vsmcs in diabetic fatty rats. indeed, as reported previously [25–27, 35–37], the proliferation of vsmcs in diabetic
rats was more rapid than that in normal rats, and the amelioration of glucose intolerance and/or glucose-related metabolites
by some agents could suppress vsmc growth in animal model.
in agreement with our findings, several investigators have demonstrated that treatment with other alpha-gis reduce the progression of human carotid imt of human carotid arteries in igt
subjects [13] and diabetic patients [15]. however, the precise
mechanism(s) to ascertain the anti-atherogenicity by alpha-gis on
the process occurring early in diabetes is not fully understood.
recent studies have demonstrated that inflammatory factors,
including proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and oxidative stresses, play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and atherosclerosis [38–40]. the elevation of serum levels
and gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as
 xxxg357xxx , are considered one of the regulators of chronic inflammatory responses in a diabetic condition [40]. we then evaluated the eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on the changes of adipocytokines,
including hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. although
the  xxxg357xxx  level in untreated fatty rats was significantly higher
than that in untreated lean rats,  xxxd2644xxx  slightly decreased the
level in fatty rats (table 2). the result suggests that postprandial
hyperglycemia itself is involved in mediating diabetic chronic
inflammatory responses, leading to the progression of atherosclerotic change.
ridker et al. clearly demonstrated that the hs-crp level, a marker
of inflammation, is a stronger predictor of cvd events than other
clinical laboratory parameters, including low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [41]. furthermore, zhang et al. reported that
the measurement of hs-crp is useful for the estimation of
atherosclerotic change in animal model [42]. accordingly, we
examined the eﬀect of  xxxd2644xxx  on the changes of hs-crp in this
study. interestingly, almost similar to the results of plasma glucose and i/m ratio, the hs-crp level in untreated fatty rats was
significantly higher than that in untreated lean rats, and treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  significantly decreased the level in fatty rats
(䊉䉴 fig. 3). therefore, it is reasonable that the inhibition of postprandial hyperglycemia by  xxxd2644xxx  might be the most beneficial

means to prevent advanced diabetic cvd beyond its hypoglycemic eﬀects. although the precise mechanism(s) by which
 xxxd2644xxx  aﬀected the reduction of hs-crp remains unclear, one
likely contributor might be associated with the special pharmacological property of  xxxd2644xxx , since the agent is well-absorbed
and circulates in its original form [19]. in addition, the other
might be due to the slight body weight reduction by the agent,
leading to improve insulin resistance. recently, yokoyama et al.
have recently shown that  xxxd2644xxx  can decrease the levels of body
mass index and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in 28 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus [43].
in conclusion, in the present study, we have established that
 xxxd2644xxx  ameliorates glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia as
well as the inhibition of intimal thickening in a balloon-injured
artery mainly by reducing the amount of vsmcs, in high-fat fed
diabetic wistar fatty rats. the agent could suppress chronic
inflammatory responses, including hs-crp, especially in diabetic
fatty rats. these results provide a new insight into the potential
cellular mechanisms in the vasculature whereby the inhibition
of postprandial hyperglycemia by  xxxd2644xxx  may have clinical
benefits and contribute to the prevention of cvd associated with
diabetes mellitus.
