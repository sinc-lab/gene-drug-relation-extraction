abstract the molecular mechanisms of how k1 and l subunits
of voltage-gated ca2 + channels interact with one another are
still controversial. here we show that despite a mutation in the
l interaction domain that has previously been shown to disrupt
binding, k1c y467s and l1amyc still formed immunoprecipitable
complexes when coexpressed in tsa201 cells. however, the
k1c y467s^l
l1amyc complexes had a decreased a⁄nity to (+)[3 h]isradipine. this indicates that the l interaction domain in
the i^ii loop of the k1 subunit is not merely an anchor required
for the functional interaction of the two ca2 + channel subunits
but is itself part of the e¡ector pathway for l-induced channel
modulation. 1 2002 published by elsevier science b.v. on

1. introduction
the cytoplasmic l subunits of voltage-dependent ca2þ
channels are important determinants of plasma membrane
expression and modulators of channel functions of the poreforming k1 subunit. evidence supporting the ‘chaperone’
function of the l subunit in membrane incorporation of k1
includes observations of increased current densities [1^4], the
increased number of drug binding sites [2,5], and an increased
membrane localization observed with immunocytochemistry
[6^8]. evidence for a current-modulating role of the l subunit
includes changes in current kinetics, most notably the l isoform-speci¢c e¡ects on inactivation properties [9,10], and
changes of single-channel properties [4,11^13].
increasing evidence suggests the existence of two types of
k1 ^l interaction sites in the k1 subunit: a high-a⁄nity binding site in the cytoplasmic loop connecting the homologous

repeats i and ii [14] and several binding sites at the n-terminus [15,16] and the c-terminus [17,18] of particular k1 subunits. the amino acid motif qq-e--l-gy- -wi--e constituting the i^ii loop l interaction domain is highly conserved
between the k1 subunit isoforms [14] and mutating one or
more of these residues prevents subunit association [19]. a
possible role of the i^ii loop in membrane insertion was suggested, according to which association of l with the i^ii loop
inhibits the retention of the channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) [20]. an involvement in modulatory functions was
suggested by experiments in which a synthetic peptide corresponding to the i^ii l interaction domain of k1c reversed the
e¡ects of l on the open probability in inside-out patches [21].
however, other studies indicate that multiple sites on the k1
subunit play speci¢c roles in membrane incorporation and
modulation of the ca2þ channel [4,16,22,23].
we have previously shown that the substitution of a critical
residue (y467s) in the l interaction motif in the i^ii loop of
k1c prevented colocalization of k1c and a l1agfp fusion
protein as well as the enhanced membrane incorporation
seen with immunocytochemistry [4]. surprisingly, this mutation did not prevent l-induced modulation of current kinetics
or the increase in single-channel open probability. here we
demonstrate that k1c y467s forms immunoprecipitable complexes with l subunits that can explain the previously observed e¡ects of l on k1c y467s function. moreover, the observation that the a⁄nity of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding to
k1c y467s^l1amyc complexes is reduced compared to wild
type emphasizes the importance of the l interaction domain
in the i^ii loop in mediating the e¡ects of l subunits on the
properties of the conduction pore.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture and transfection
tsa201 cells were grown in f12 medium (gibco brl, vienna,
austria) containing 10% fetal bovine serum to 80% con£uence. for
transfections 10 wg plasmid dna and 10 wg unspeci¢c dna (puc18)
diluted in 250 mm cacl2 solution were mixed with a solution containing 274 mm nacl, 40 mm hepes, 10 mm kcl, 1.4 mm
na2 hpo4 w12h2 o and 12 mm dextrose (ph 7.05).
2.2. expression plasmids
the generation of k1c y467s has been described elsewhere [4]. the
myc-tagged rabbit skeletal muscle l1a subunit (l1amyc ) was generated
by fusing the cdna sequence encoding a single copy of the myc
antibody epitope to the 3p end of l1a in pcdna3. a pcr fragment
containing the 3p end of l1a fused to the myc cdna followed by an
xbai site was created (antisense primer: 5p-gtc tag act aat

was digested with nari (nt 1147 of l1a ) and xbai and ligated into a
l1a ^pbluescript construct. finally, l1amyc was inserted into pcdna3
(invitrogen, san diego, ca, usa) via kpni and xbai. all regions
containing pcr-ampli¢ed products were veri¢ed by sequence analysis.
2.3. immuno£uorescence staining
cover glasses with cells were removed from the culture dishes before harvesting, ¢xed and immunostained as previously described [24].
the following antibodies were used: a⁄nity-puri¢ed anti-k1c cnc
(1:1000) [25] and anti-l com (1:1200) [26]; mouse monoclonal antimyc 9e10 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa); £uorescein- and texas
red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse iggs (jackson immuno research, west grove, pa, usa).
2.4. crude membrane preparation
after harvesting transfected tsa201 cells were incubated for 15 min
on ice in hypotonic bu¡er (10 mm tris^hcl (ph 7.4), 100 mm trypsin, 1 wm pepstatin a, 1 mm leupeptin, 0.5 mm  xxxd302xxx , 0.2
mm phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride (pmsf), 2 mm iodoacetamide)
and then homogenized with a tight-¢tting glass-glass dounce homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 400ug at 4‡c.
microsomes were collected by centrifuging the supernatant for 10 min
at 90 000ug at 4‡c. the pellet was resuspended in the hypotonic
bu¡er and the protein concentration was determined using a lowry
assay.
2.5. radioligand binding assays
membrane protein (100 wg/ml) was incubated with increasing con-

189
centrations of (+)-[3 h]isradipine (0.01^1.3 nm) for 120 min at room
temperature in 1 ml of 50 mm tris^hcl (ph 7.4), 1 mm cacl2 and
0.1 mm pmsf. non-speci¢c binding was determined in the presence
of 1 wm ( w )-isradipine. bound ligand was determined by ¢ltration
through polyethyleneimine-treated gf/c whatman ¢lters [27]. filters
were washed and the bound radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting.
2.6. immunoprecipitation
membrane protein (2 mg) was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 50 mm tris^hcl (ph 7.4), 0.1 mm pmsf, 1 mm cacl2 and
0.6 nm (+)-[3 h]isradipine. after another 30 min incubation on ice the
mixture was centrifuged at 100 000ug for 15 min to remove free
radioligand. the pellet was dissolved in 1 ml solubilization bu¡er
(sb) containing 2% digitonin and tbs (150 mm nacl, 50 mm
tris^hcl (ph 7.4), 0.1 mm pmsf), incubated for 30 min on ice
and insoluble material removed by centrifugation (100 000ug, 30
min, 4‡c). solubilized protein in the supernatant was subjected to
immunoprecipitation or directly analyzed in western blots. for immunoprecipitation 7 wg protein a-sepharose (pas) was incubated
with anti-myc antibody 9e10 or equivalent amounts of control igg,
and washed in sb diluted three-fold in tbs. 100 wl of the solubilized
membrane protein plus 200 wl tbs were mixed with the pas-bound
antibody for 4 h at 4‡c. after washing the antibody-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. for western
blot analysis the pas^antibody pellet was resuspended in sodium
dodecylsulfate (sds) sample bu¡er (10 mm tris^hcl (ph 7.4),
20% glycerin, 10% sds, 10 mm dithiothreitol and bromophenol
blue), heated to 95‡c for 3 min and loaded on 7% polyacrylamide

3. results
3.1. di¡erential distribution of wild type k1c and mutant
k1c y467s coexpressed with l1amyc
double immuno£uorescence labeling of transfected tsa201
cells demonstrated that wild type k1c and l1amyc are colocalized in surface membrane clusters (fig. 1a,b) and in internal
membrane compartments, presumably the er (fig. 1c,d).
this colocalization was prevented by the single residue substitution in k1c y467s (fig. 1e,f). whereas k1c y467s was still
expressed in the er (fig. 1e) and at a strongly reduced rate in
surface membrane clusters, l1amyc was not colocalized with
k1c y467s in either of these locations. instead, l1amyc showed
a uniform cytoplasmic staining (fig. 1f), similar to the labeling pattern observed in tsa201 cells expressing l1amyc without a k1 subunit (not shown). this lack of colocalization
suggests the loss or a dramatic reduction of k1c ^l association
due to the y467s substitution. in addition, detectable surface
membrane clusters decreased from 54% in k1c /l1amyc expressing cells to 4% in k1c y467s/l1amyc expressing cells

(s). b: comparison of k1c and k1c y467s coexpressed with l1amyc

western blot of corresponding samples (20 wg/lane) demonstrates
that the concentrations of ca2þ channels were similar in preparations of k1c /k2 n/l1amyc and k1c y467s/k2 n/l1amyc .

k1c +l1amyc and with k1c y467s+l1amyc ; means w s.d. of three independent experiments. b: western blot analysis with anti-k1c
shows that l1amyc precipitated k1c and k1c y467s. whereas crude
and solubilized membranes contained roughly equal amounts of k1c
and k1c y467s, l1amyc precipitated less than half of k1c y467s
compared to k1c . mock-transfected cells (mock) and equal
amounts of control iggs (not shown) demonstrated that there was
no non-speci¢c staining at the position of the k1c band.

3.2. l1amyc forms immunoprecipitable complexes with k1c and
with k1c y467s
whereas the disruption of k1 ^l colocalization by the y467s
substitution is consistent with published data on the importance of this residue in l binding [19], it is in apparent con£ict with the fully functional l-induced modulation of wholecell and single-channel currents previously observed with
k1c y467s [4]. to clarify whether k1c y467s is still capable
of forming stable complexes with the l subunit, we performed
immunoprecipitation experiments on digitonin-solubilized
membranes of tsa201 cells cotransfected with l1amyc and
either k1c or k1c y467s. an antibody against l1amyc precipitated (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding activity from cells expressing
k1c as well as from cells expressing k1c y467s (fig. 2a). this

indicates that l1amyc and k1c y467s exist in complexes stable
enough to withstand solubilization and washing. however,
compared to k1c , k1c y467s forms stable complexes with l
at a reduced rate. after normalization to di¡erences in the
amounts of k1 protein measured in the parallel western blot
analysis, the values for immunoprecipitated (+)-[3 h]isradipine-labeled k1c y467s subunits were between 25 and 60%
of those for k1c in the same experiments.
this reduced precipitation of (+)-[3 h]isradipine could be
due to a reduced number of k1c y467s^l1amyc complexes,
or it could result from an increased dissociation rate of (+)[3 h]isradipine from normal amounts of k1c y467s^l1amyc
complexes. to discriminate between these two possibilities,
the amounts of immunoprecipitated k1c and k1c y467s were
directly compared by western blot analysis. the results shown
in fig. 2b con¢rm that anti-l1amyc still precipitates
k1c y467s, and that the amount of k1c y467s in the precipitate is about half of that of k1c , even though the concentrations of k1c and k1c y467s in the starting materials were
equal. thus, the y467s substitution in the l interaction domain reduced but did not fully abolish the capacity of the
mutant to form k1c y467s^l1amyc complexes.
3.3. (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding properties of k1c are altered
by the y467s substitution
the e¡ects of decreased formation of k1c y467s^l1amyc
complexes compared to wild type are also re£ected in (+)[3 h]isradipine binding assays. fig. 3a shows representative
saturation curves and scatchard plots of (+)-[3 h]isradipine
binding to crude membrane preparations of tsa201 cells
transfected with wild type or mutant k1c with and without
l1amyc . (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding to k1c alone was too low
(0.05 pmol/mg) to accurately calculate kd values, but coexpression of k1c with l1amyc increased the bmax of (+)[3 h]isradipine binding 20-fold (table 1). similarly, l1amyc
coexpression dramatically increased the bmax of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding to k1c y467s from below detectability to
0.44 w 0.46 (n = 3 experiments performed in parallel) of wild
type levels. despite the mutation in the l interaction domain
of k1c y467s, this mutant still bound (+)-[3 h]isradipine in a
l1amyc -sensitive manner. direct comparison in two parallel
experiments revealed 33% and 53% reduction of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding sites with k1c y467s+l1amyc compared to
k1c +l1amyc . this is consistent with the reduced amount of
k1c y467s^l1amyc complexes found in the immunoprecipitation assay (see above). however, not only bmax but also
the a⁄nity of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding was signi¢cantly
(p = 0.0034) reduced for k1c y467s (table 1).
coexpression of l1amyc plus k2 n with wild type or mutant
channels caused a further increase of a⁄nity and bmax of (+)[3 h]isradipine binding (fig. 3b; table 1). here again the mu-

tation in the l interaction domain of k1c y467s reduced bmax
for (+)-[3 h]isradipine (table 1). parallel western blot analysis
(fig. 3c) con¢rmed that the di¡erence in available (+)[3 h]isradipine binding sites did not result from di¡erent expression levels of k1c and k1c y467s. taken together this
shows that the association of k1c with l1amyc increases
bmax and the a⁄nity of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding to k1c ,
with the major e¡ect on bmax , and that the l1amyc -mediated
increase of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding is still observed with
k1c y467s. however, in preparations containing k1c y467s
not only bmax but also the kd values are reduced. thus, the
y-to-s substitution in the l interaction domain reduced the
total number of k1 ^l complexes. but it also diminished the
ability of l subunits to convert these k1c y467s^l1amyc complexes into a high-a⁄nity state for (+)-[3 h]isradipine.
4. discussion
the present results clearly demonstrate that k1c y467s ^ an
k1c mutant with a single residue substitution in the primary l
interaction domain ^ is still capable of forming stable complexes with the l1amyc subunit. this is unexpected because
the tyrosine in position 467 of k1c is one of three conserved
amino acids in the l interaction domain in the i^ii loop of
voltage-gated ca2þ channels that have been considered essential for l binding. the corresponding substitution in the k1a
channel isoform resulted in a loss of binding in an overlay
assay and in a strong reduction of current amplitude when
coexpressed with l1b [14]. in an in vitro binding assay a 55
amino acid fusion protein containing the mutated l interaction domain showed s 90% reduction in l1b binding [19]. a
possible explanation of the di¡erences to our present ¢ndings
could be that this particular residue or even the entire l interaction domain in the i^ii loop contributed di¡erently to
complex formation in the neuronal and in the muscle isoforms. in previous studies of our own laboratory the mutation
in the l interaction domain disrupted the colocalization of the
k1c and l subunits as seen with immunocytochemistry, whereas the l-induced increase in current amplitudes and singlechannel open probability was still observed [4,23]. the ¢nding
of immunoprecipitable complexes of k1c y467s and l1amyc in
the present study explains the l-induced functional e¡ects on
k1c y467s. however, it is surprising that a two-fold reduction
in complex formation detected in (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding
and immunoprecipitation assays should make such a striking
di¡erence in the colocalization and surface membrane clustering detected with immunocytochemistry.
secondly, the present ¢ndings show that the l interaction
domain in the i^ii loop is involved in the l-mediated stabilization of a high-a⁄nity (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding state of the
k1 subunit. it has previously been shown that coexpression of

k1c and l1a increases of a⁄nity of (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding
to k1c due to a decreased dissociation rate [27,28]. the
present ¢ndings extend this observation by showing that the
conversion of k1c to a high-a⁄nity binding state is a¡ected by
the y-to-s substitution. not only the concentration of stable
k1c y467s^l1amyc complexes is decreased, but also the mechanism by which l binding leads to high-a⁄nity (+)[3 h]isradipine binding is directly altered by the mutation.
whereas the decrease of the bmax can be explained by a lower
occupancy of k1c y467s by l1amyc due to a reduced binding
a⁄nity of the i^ii loop, this does not explain the decreased
a⁄nity of (+)-[3 h]isradipine to the remaining k1c y467s^
l1amyc complexes. this ¢nding suggests that the y-to-s mutation leads to an altered conformation of the dihydropyridine
binding pocket, and thus emphasizes the role of the i^ii linker
in the transmission of conformational changes from the l
binding site to the (+)-[3 h]isradipine binding site. since the
dihydropyridine binding site in k1c is intimately related to the
ca2þ selectivity ¢lter in the channel pore [29,30], such a functional link between the i^ii loop and the ion conductance
pathway could represent an e⁄cient modulatory switch for
channel properties.
