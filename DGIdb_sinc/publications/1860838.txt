swiss 3t3 fibroblasts (3t3k)were maintained in a subconfluent
state and made confluent and quiescent before each experiment as
described previously (27).
release of radioactivity from cells prelabeled with [‘hlarachidonic
acid was measured in the following way. confluent cells in 24- or 48well plates were labeled with [’hlarachidonic acid (0.1 &i/ml) in
dulbecco’s minimal essential medium containing 0.2% bovine serum
albumin for 20 h and a t the same time made quiescent (27). cells
were washed three times with hanks’/hepes buffer (hanks’ solution
containing 20 mm hepes, ph 7.4) containing 0.2% bovine serum
albumin at 37 “c, preincubated in the same buffer for 10 min and

a detailed time course of the  xxxg977xxx -induced ['hiaa release is studied and compared at 0.03 and 3.0 mm medium
calcium concentrations. as shown by solid lines in fig. 3,
 xxxg977xxx -induced release of ['hh]aa increases rapidly within
10 min of  xxxg977xxx  stimulation to the similar extent
at either
0.03 or 3.0 mm calcium. however,the subsequent time
courses
are quite different. at 3.0 mm calcium, [3h]aa continues to
increase with time at a constant rate for at least 60 min. by
contrast, at 0.03 mm calcium, there is no further increase in
the level of [3h]aa after 10 min at all. these observations
demonstrate that theeffect of  xxxg977xxx  on ['hiaa release is
temporally composed of two phases, i.e. the first phase (within
10 min) which is largely independent of extracellular ca'+,
andthe second sustainedphase(after10min)
which is
absolutely dependent on the extracellular ca2+. if cells are
preincubated for 30 min at nominally free calcium instead of
1.8 mm (fig. 3, dashed line),  xxxg977xxx  still induces the first
phase response in the absence
of added ca2+;however fails to
induce the second phase response. if the medium calcium is

indicate that  xxxg977xxx  as well as pdbu activates phospholipase ap in swiss 3t3 fibroblasts.
in various cell types ca2+mobilizing agonists are reported
t o liberate  xxxd208xxx  and its metabolites in an extracellular ca2+-dependent manner (10-13, 17, 30). however, a
few reports describe that there is a ca2+-independent component (31-33). indeed, in swiss 3t3 fibroblasts the
effect of
 xxxg977xxx  on [3h]aa release is largely dependentonthe
extracellular ca'+ concentration, andis potently inhibited by
a n inorganic ca2+ channel blocker co2+ (fig. 2, a and b ) ;
however, it is not completely abolished evenat nominally free
ca2+(fig. 2 a ) or by 1.0 mm co2+ (fig. 2 b ) . these findings
indicate that the effect of  xxxg977xxx  on [3h]aa release involves both extracellular ca2+-dependent and -independent
mechanisms. this is clearly demonstrated in fig. 3, in which

of [3h]aa.release of['hh]aa was measured a t various concentrations of cac12 ( a ) or at1.8 mm caci2 plus various concentrations of

the rate of release of [3h]aaalso reaches a peak value within
1min of  xxxg977xxx  addition, which then gradually declines to
a new steady-state level during the following 10 min. shown
in fig. 5 are the effects of  xxxg977xxx  on the release rates of
[3h]aa and 45cain the presence or absence of extracellular
ca2+, andfrom cells preloaded with quin2.  xxxg977xxx -induced
mobilization of 45caand [3h]aa are both unequivocally observed irrespective of the extracellular ca2+ concentration
(0.03 versw 3.0mm) and even at nominally free ca2+,confirming that the initial transient phase of  xxxg977xxx -induced
['hiaa liberation is essentially independent of ca2+ influx
from outside the cells. however, if cells are preloaded with a
ca2+chelator (quin2),  xxxg977xxx -induced 45ca effluxis markedly reduced and the release of [3h]aa occurs much slower
and to a considerably smaller extent as compared to control
cells. these results strongly suggest that  xxxg977xxx -induced
intracellular ca2+mobilization is causally related to the first
transient phase of  xxxg977xxx -induced [3h]aaliberation.
we next examined the effect of a ca2+ionophore a23187
on the release of [3h]aa. interestingly, the effect of a23187
(1pm) on [3h]aaliberation is much smaller as compared to
 xxxg977xxx 
m) even in the presence of 1.8 mm extracellular calcium (fig. 6). in the absence of extracellular calcium,
a23187 fails to induce detectable [3h]aaliberation, despite
the fact that it effectively induces mobilization of intracellularly loaded 45cato a comparable extent asbombesin (fig. 7).
these observations indicate that  xxxg977xxx -induced intracellular ca2+mobilization by itself is not sufficient as a signal
for the first transient phase of [3h]aa liberation. fig. 7 also
shows that pdbu strongly potentiates the effect of a23187
on [3h]aa liberation even in the absence of extracellular
calcium, to a level comparable to  xxxg977xxx  effect itself. however, pkc activation is not likely to be involved in the first
phase response of  xxxg977xxx -induced phospholipase aq activation (see below).
pkc activation contributes to the second but not the first
phase response of  xxxg977xxx -induced phiaa liberatwnsince  xxxg977xxx  induces a rapid and sustained activation of
pkc in swiss 3t3 fibroblasts (23-25), and since apkcactivating  xxxd2925xxx  stimulatesphospholipase az in swiss
3t3 cells (table i) as well as in other cell types (30, 34-39),
it is very likely that pkc is involved in  xxxg977xxx -induced
['hiaa liberation in swiss 3t3 fibroblasts. to evaluate this
point, we first studied the effect of pdbu on [3h]aa release

 xxxg977xxx -induced armhidonate mobilization

release is mediated by phospholipase aq activation in both
phases, although diacylglycerol lipase may also be involved to
a smaller extent.
the first transientphase of  xxxg977xxx -induced [3h]aaliberation occurs concomitantly with 45ca mobilization from
intracellular store(s),even in the absence of extracellular cap+
(figs. 4and 5). chelation by quin2 of intracellularca2+
substantially inhibits and delays the first phase response of
 xxxg977xxx -induced [3h]aaliberation (fig. 5), indicating that
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediatedca2+mobilization from
intracellular store is playing an important role in phospholipase az activation during the initial phase of the  xxxg977xxx 
action in swiss 3t3 fibroblasts. this finding is in contrast to
the observation reported by brooks et al. (21) in glioma cells.
the discrepancy between their observation and the present
result may at least in part be due to differences in observed
time points after agonist addition and the cell types studied.
the present study also demonstrates, however, that an increase in the intracellular free ca2+concentrationisnot
sufficient by itself as asignal to activate phospholipase az,as
demonstrated by experiments using a cap+ionophore a23187
(figs. 6 and 7). at first, we naively hypothesized that, since
 xxxg977xxx  rapidly activates pkc (24), a combination of ca2+
mobilization and pkc activation would result in the first
phase response of  xxxg977xxx -induced phospholipase aq activation. in supportof this view was an observation that pdbu
strongly enhances the effect of a23187 (figs. 7 and 9), even
in the absence of extracellular ca2+;under such a condition
a23187 induces the same extents of mobilization in 45caas
well as [3h]aa,as compared to  xxxg977xxx  (fig. 7). the synergistic activation of phospholipase aq by a combination of
a23187 and active phorbol esters has also been reported in
other cell types (34-37). however, experiments using pkcdown-regulated cells strongly suggest that pkc activation is
not likely to be involved in the first phase response of  xxxg977xxx -induced  xxxg1759xxx  activation (fig. 11).in fact,
it takes several minutes before  xxxg977xxx  maximally activates
pkc to phosphorylate the cellular substrate marcks (24),
whereas the first phase of  xxxg977xxx -induced [3h]aaliberation reaches the maximum within a minute (fig. 4). thus,
the mechanisms underlying the first phase of  xxxg977xxx -induced phospholipase ap activation involves intracellular caq+
mobilization andanother receptor-mediated process other
than pkc activation. it is an interesting possibility that this
latter process, although yet to be defined, converts phospholipase azto a statehighly sensitive to ca2+,so that theenzyme
is ready to exert its maximal effect upon cap+mobilization.
the second sustained phase of  xxxg977xxx -induced [3h]aa
liberation involves both pkc-dependent and -independent
mechanisms (fig. 11). experiments with pkc-down-regulated cells suggest that approximately two-thirds of the  xxxg977xxx  effect in this phase is dependent on the pkc action,
demonstrating aclose relationship between the phospholipase
c-linked signaling pathway and phospholipase az in this
phase aswell. the pkc-dependent component, as well as the
pkc-independent one, is entirely dependent on the extracellular ca2+ and is abolished at 0.03 mm calcium (fig. 3). we
found that  xxxg977xxx  induces sustained increases in the cellular content of 1,2-diacylglyceroland phosphorylation of the
cellular pkc substrate marcks protein to the similar extents irrespective of the extracellular ca2+ concentration
(0.03
versus 3.0mm) for at least 4h (28). these observations
indicate that the extracellular ca2+-dependent step in pkcmediated phospholipase az activation is located after pkc
activation. thus, as has been reported with other ca2+-mobilizing hormones (10, 17),  xxxg977xxx -induced activations of

phospholipase c andphospholipase ap show distinct dependencies on the extracellular ca2+in swiss 3t3 cells. however,
this does not imply that each process is independent and in
parallel. with this respect, we have also examined whether
neomycin, proposed specific inhibitor of phosphoinositidehydrolyzing phospholipase c (41), dissociates  xxxg977xxx  effects on [3h]aaliberation and 45caefflux. neomycin at the
concentration range of 0.5-2.5 mm inhibited basal 45caefflux
without reducing the  xxxg977xxx -induced increase over the
control value. similar nonspecific inhibition by neomycin was
also observed on [3h]aarelease especially after a prolonged
incubation.
as reported in other cell types (30, 34-39), pdbu by itself
stimulates  xxxd3060xxx -sensitive liberation of [3h]aain swiss
3t3 cells, which is entirely dependent on pkc action (fig.
11)and the extracellular ca2+(fig. 8b).its temporal profile
is distinct from that induced by  xxxg977xxx : the pdbu effect
becomes evident only after a lag period of several minutes
(fig. 8a), which further supports the notion that pkc is not
involved in the first phase response to  xxxg977xxx . the lag
period required for pdbu to activate phospholipase az (fig.
8 a ) but not pkc(42) supports the view that pkc experts its
effect via an indirect mechanism, which may involve phosphorylation of phospholipase ap-modulatoryproteins such as
lipocortins (43, 44). a brief (10 min) exposure of cells to
pdbu strongly potentiates  xxxg977xxx -induced phospholipase
aq activation in both phases in a pkc-dependent manner
(figs. 9-11). it is likely that the synergistic potentiation by
pdbu of the  xxxg977xxx -induced first phase response involves
a combined effect of cap+mobilization and pkc activation,
which is readily mimicked by a combination of a23187 and
a
effect of pkc activation
pdbu (figs. 7 and 9), andcombined
and the putative  xxxg977xxx  receptor-mediated process that is
independent of ca2+mobilization or pkc action. it is possible
that the lattermechanism is responsible as a major basis for
the synergism observed between  xxxg977xxx  and pdbu in the
second sustained phase aswell.
it is likely that the putative  xxxg977xxx  receptor-mediated
process, which is responsible for components independent of
either ca2+mobilization or pkc activation in both phases,
involves a gtp-binding regulatory protein, as has been proposed in other cell types (7-15,17-20).
our preliminary
experiments suggest that the putative g protein involved is
insensitive to pertussis toxin, as is the g protein involved in
 xxxg977xxx -induced phospholipase c activation (45, 46); although the toxin enhances the basal release of [3h]aa in
unstimulated control cells. additionally, a possible change in
the intracellular ph could also contribute to  xxxg977xxx -induced phospholipase az activation, as has been reported in
human platelets (47). since more than one intracellular phospholipase az enzymes have been reported thus far (48-53), it
would be interesting to examine which  xxxg1759xxx  is
involved in each of the  xxxg977xxx  receptor-mediatedprocesses.
further studies arerequired to elucidate these points, aswell
as the implications of the phospholipases a2-linked signaling
pathway in  xxxg977xxx -induced mitogenesis.
