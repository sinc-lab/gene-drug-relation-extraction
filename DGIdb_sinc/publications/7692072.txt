kaposi's sarcoma

background: neovascularization induced by basic fibroblast growth
factor (basic fgf) or fgf-like
cytokines is thought to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of
human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)-associated kaposi's sarcoma.
 xxxd2878xxx  has been shown
to inhibit basic fgf and fgf-like
dependent tumor growth both in
vitro and in vivo. moreover, it has
been found to inhibit the growth of
kaposi's sarcoma-derived spindle
cells in vitro. these observations
suggested that  xxxd2878xxx 
might be worth exploring as a potential agent for the treatment of kaposi's sarcoma. purpose: the purpose of this phase i clinical trial was
to determine the maximum tolerated

growth of certain tumors is dependent
on neovascularization induced by
tumor-derived angiogenic factors, such
as  xxxg787xxx  (basic
fgf) (4-6). researchers (7-70) have
previously reported data suggesting that
kaposi's sarcoma cells may contain a
gene that has transforming capability
via the production of a factor resembling fgf. more recent studies (11-13)
using cultured spindle cells as a model
for kaposi's sarcoma have provided
evidence that cytokines associated with
angiogenesis, such as basic fgf, may
play an important role in the pathogenesis of hiv-associated kaposi's
sarcoma. while such factors do not
appear to be sufficient in themselves to
induce kaposi's sarcoma, they stimulate the growth of kaposi's sarcoma
spindle cells, and there is presently an
interest in exploring the use of agents
that inhibit these cytokines in patients
with hiv-associated kaposi's sarcoma.
xylanopolyhydrogensulfate (pentosan
polysulfate) is a sulfated polysaccharide
that has been used clinically for years
as an anticoagulant (14,15). pentosan
polysulfate has been shown to inhibit
the ability of fgf to promote the
growth of bovine aortic endothelial
cells and the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (16,17). it has thus been
speculated that  xxxd2878xxx 
may inhibit fgf-induced angiogenesis.
 xxxd2878xxx  has also been
shown to inhibit the growth of an
adrenal cancer cell line transfected with
a kaposi's sarcoma-derived fgf oncogene ( xxxg789xxx ) in vitro and in vivo
(18,19). this transfected line constitutively secretes an fgf-like protein
( xxxg789xxx ) that is believed to promote its
growth through an autocrine1 loop.
more recently,  xxxd2878xxx  has
been shown to inhibit the paracrine
activity of heparin-binding growth factors secreted by a variety of malignant
cell lines (20). furthermore, it inhibits
the growth of tumors formed by these
lines in athymic nude mice. at concentrations of between 5 and 10
m-g/ml,  xxxd2878xxx  has been

by infusion followed by 4 mg/kg per
dose given subcutaneously (five patients). five of the 16 patients in the
study also received injections of 1 mg
of  xxxd2878xxx  into two
different lesions two times a week for
3 weeks, followed by intralesional
therapy once weekly. after receiving
 xxxd2878xxx  for 6 weeks,
patients were administered 100 mg
zidovudine (azt) orally every 4
hours in conjunction with pentosan
polysulfate. results: the maximally
tolerated dose of  xxxd2878xxx 
given by continuous venous infusion
was found to be 3 mg/kg per day. no
patient had an objective clinical
antitumor response to either systemic
or intralesional  xxxd2878xxx 
administration; however, three patients had stable kaposi's sarcoma
for 3-27 weeks. no statistically significant effect on cd4 cells or serum
hiv p24 antigen was noted during
 xxxd2878xxx  administration.
dose-limiting toxic effects were
characterized by anticoagulation and
thrombocytopenia and were reversible. conclusion:  xxxd2878xxx  was well tolerated in this patient
population. however, no objective
tumor response or evidence of antihiv activity was noted; therefore, no
claim of activity can be made in this
trial. implication: continued investigation into the use of angiogenesis
inhibitors with improved activity and
toxicity profiles or different mechanisms of action is warranted. [j natl

data]. also,  xxxd2878xxx  has
been reported to be active against hiv
in vitro and to be synergistic with
zidovudine (azt; 3'-azido-2',3'dideoxythymidine) (22-25). with this
background, we decided to explore the
toxicity of  xxxd2878xxx  and the
feasibility of its use in the treatment of
hiv-associated kaposi's sarcoma.

patients and methods
patient population

 xxxd2878xxx 
 xxxd2878xxx  (nsc 626201) was supplied by the cancer therapy evaluation program,
division of cancer treatment, national cancer
institute (nci) in 1-ml ampules. each ampule
contained 100 mg of 100% sodium pentosan
polysulfate (bene-chemie gmbh, munich, federal republic of germany), 13.8 mg of a sodium
 xxxd2478xxx  ( xxxd2478xxx ,  xxxd2216xxx ) and sodium
hydroxide (naoh) buffer (merck ag,
darmstadt, federal republic of germany), and
water as a solvent. the appropriate dose of
 xxxd2878xxx  was administered during the
period of continuous venous infusion using the
pharmacia deltec cadd-1 infusion pump (pharmacia deltec inc., st. paul, minn.) a 24-hour
supply of  xxxd2878xxx  was prepared
daily in normal saline to a final volume of 90
ml in a pharmacia medication reservoir (pharmacia deltec inc.). for subcutaneous administration, patients were instructed to prepare and selfadminister their doses.

treatment regimen
all patients were initially treated as inpatients
and then followed as outpatients at the warren
grant magnuson clinical center, national institutes of health, bethesda, md., according to a
research protocol approved by the clinical research subpanel of the national cancer institute
(nci). patients received  xxxd2878xxx  via
continuous venous infusion for 3-6 weeks and

then were to receive the daily dose subcutaneously three times per week for up to 12
months. this was a dose-escalating study. in all,
three different doses of  xxxd2878xxx 
were administered: (a) 2 mg/kg per day by
continuous venous infusion followed by 2 mg/kg
per dose given subcutaneously (six patients), (h)
3 mg/kg per day by continuous venous infusion
followed by 3 mg/kg per dose given subcutaneously (five patients), and (c) 4 mg/kg per day
by continuous venous infusion followed by 4 mg/
kg per dose given subcutaneously (five patients).
five of the 16 patients in the study also were to
receive injections of 1 mg of  xxxd2878xxx  into two different lesions two times a week
for 3 weeks, followed by intralesional therapy
once weekly for up to 6 weeks. the intralesional
injections were begun concurrently with intravenous therapy. after receiving  xxxd2878xxx  for 6 weeks, patients were administered
azt, 100 mg given orally every 4 hours, in
conjunction with  xxxd2878xxx .

evaluations
flow cytometry was performed to determine
the number of lymphocytes per microliter of
whole blood reacting to leu-3 (cd4 + , t4+,
helper-inducer cells). in addition, serum hiv p24
antigen levels were ascertained by enzyme-linked
lmmunosorbent assay. both studies were performed at the time of enrollment in this study
and then periodically during treatment as previously described (26-28). biochemical and
hematologic assessments were performed routinely throughout the period of treatment, and
radiologic studies (including chest x rays and
computerized tomography) were done when
clinically indicated. clinical staging of kaposi's
sarcoma disease based on the extent of tumor,
immunologic status, and the presence or absence
of systemic symptoms as well as assessment of
response to treatment was performed using the
criteria established by the aids clinical trial

the clinical profiles of the 16 patients at entry
are listed in table 1. all patients were hiv
seropositive and had biopsy-proven mucocutaneous kaposi's sarcoma without evidence of
active visceral disease at the time of enrollment.
as specified by the protocol, no patient had
active or previously diagnosed non-hodgkin's
lymphoma, active opportunistic infections, or a
karnofsky performance status of less than 70.
seven patients had been administered systemic
therapy for kaposi's sarcoma prior to enrollment;
however, in each case, therapy was stopped 4 or
more weeks prior to entry. four of these seven
patients received interferon only, two received
interferon and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and one
received cytotoxic chemotherapy only. two
patients had received prior intralesional therapy
with vinblastine, and two patients had received
localized radiation therapy more than 4 weeks
prior to enrollment. all 16 patients had received
prior antiretroviral therapy with azt, and five of
these had also received didanosine (ddl; 2',3dideoxyinosine). antiretroviral therapy was discontinued for 3 weeks or more prior to

pharmacokinetics
we were unable to reproducibly
determine plasma concentrations of
 xxxd2878xxx  using a published
competitive binding assay [(30);
cooper mr: unpublished results].
however, there were reports that evaluated the plasma levels of pentosan
polysulfate following injections into
humans both by using a competitive
binding assay and by converting the
increase in activated partial thromboplastin times into equivalent  xxxd2878xxx  concentrations using a
calibration curve (30-32). these two
methods were reported to yield comparable results over a limited range of
doses. therefore, the activated partial
thromboplastin times were used to
estimate  xxxd2878xxx  plasma
levels in two patients. one patient
(patient 1) was treated at the 2 mg/kg
per day level and the other (patient 15)
with 4 mg/kg per day. an estimated
peak  xxxd2878xxx  plasma level
of 10.3 jjlg/ml was obtained 2 hours
after the subcutaneous administration of
2 mg/kg (patient 1). this level fell to
4.4 jjlg/ml after 6 hours and to 0
(ig/ml at 24 hours. following the
subcutaneous administration of 4 mg/kg
of  xxxd2878xxx  (patient 15),
estimated plasma levels of 7.9 u.g/ml,
5.6 n.g/ml, and 1.2 ^g/ml were
obtained at 2, 6, and 24 hours,
respectively.  xxxd2878xxx  levels increased rapidly during the 1st day

persistent thrombocytopenia was a delayed drug effect or was related to the

two of these patients had stable disease
for more than 10 weeks (table 2).
(another four patients had stable disease for 1.4-2 weeks of therapy. these
patients did not return for post-therapy
follow-up, and because they did not
receive the drug for 3 weeks, they were
not assessable for response.) seven
patients had progressive disease. two
patients developed progressive disease
after 1.3 and 2 weeks of therapy,
respectively, but because they had not
received the drug for 3 weeks, they
were not strictly assessable for response. progressive disease in most
patients was manifested by an increase
in the number of cutaneous lesions.
however, in addition to worsening
cutaneous disease, one patient also
developed pulmonary kaposi's sarcoma
after 6 weeks of  xxxd2878xxx 
therapy. yellow halos compatible with
blood extravasation developed around
kaposi's sarcoma lesions in 10 patients, eight of whom had progressive
disease. it was thought that these halos
were due to the anticoagulant effect of
 xxxd2878xxx  and did not represent an antitumor effect.

effect of  xxxd2878xxx 
on hiv activity

because  xxxd2878xxx  has
been reported to have weak antiretroviral activity at concentrations of 4
hg/ml or higher in vitro (but also to
enhance hiv replication at lower concentrations) (22-25), we were interested
to see if it had any effect on parameters of hiv infection. overall, there
did not appear to be any trends in cd4
cells (fig. 1) or hiv p24 antigen (fig.
2) during the period that patients were
receiving  xxxd2878xxx  alone
(the first 6 weeks of  xxxd2878xxx  administration). although some
patients receiving 2 mg/kg had an
increase in their cd4 counts, there was
no statistically significant change noted
at any dose administered. a few
patients did have increases in hiv p24
antigen, although again this trend was
not statistically significant. it is conceivable that these increases may in
part have reflected a rebound from

discussion
kaposi's sarcoma, the most common
tumor developing in patients with hiv
infection, is an important cause of
morbidity and mortality in this disorder. indeed, kaposi's sarcoma has been
found to be a leading cause of death in
aids patients followed on antiretroviral protocols at the nci (33).
currently available therapeutic agents
and regimens for the systemic treatment of kaposi's sarcoma are myelotoxic, are immunosuppressive, and/or
are associated with relatively short
responses (334). thus, newer, more
effective, and less toxic regimens are
needed to treat this complication of
infection with hiv. in light of in vitro
evidence that angiogenic factors, in
particular basic fgf, are secreted in a
paracrine and autocrine manner by
kaposi's sarcoma spindle cells (11-13)
and given the highly vascular nature of
kaposi's sarcoma lesions in general
(3536), there is now an interest in
exploring inhibition of angiogenesis as a
therapeutic approach to the treatment of
kaposi's sarcoma  xxxd2878xxx ,
a drug already in clinical use, was found
to inhibit the activity of basic fgf and

other growth factors, to inhibit the
formation of tumors in nude mice, and to
inhibit the growth of kaposi's sarcoma
spindle cells in vitro (16,17,19-2137).
these findings prompted us to explore its
use as a means of specifically blocking a
step in the pathogenesis of kaposi's
sarcoma. doses of 2-3 mg/kg per day
were generally well tolerated. however,
although three patients did have stable
disease for 3-27 weeks while receiving
 xxxd2878xxx , no objective clinical
responses were seen, and some patients
had clear progression of their kaposi's
sarcoma.
we utilized serial activated partial
thromboplastin time measurements to
estimate  xxxd2878xxx  concentrations in two patients receiving 2
and 4 mg/kg per day, respectively. we

estimate that plasma  xxxd2878xxx  levels of at least 7 (ig/ml were
attained in these patients by both
continuous venous infusion and subcutaneous administration. these levels
are somewhat lower than those measured by peters and colleagues (38j9)
after intravenous dosing using an hivinhibition bioassay.  xxxd2878xxx  concentrations of between 5 and
10 |xg/ml have been found to result in
50% inhibition of kaposi's sarcoma
spindle cells in vitro [(27); foli a,
yarchoan r: unpublished data]. thus,
it appeared that concentrations of  xxxd2878xxx  which were found to
have activity against kaposi's sarcoma
spindle cells in vitro were obtained in
vivo in the plasma of these patients via
both continuous venous infusion and

subcutaneous injection.
why then was no response seen?
one possibility is that effective levels
of  xxxd2878xxx  were lower in
tissue than predicted from plasma
concentrations either because of poor
penetration or because of extensive
binding to plasma proteins. also, given
the molecular weight and strong
anionic nature of  xxxd2878xxx ,
it might be expected to remain confined to the intravascular space. we,
therefore, may not have attained in
vivo therapeutic tissue levels of  xxxd2878xxx . although administration of higher doses of pentosan
polysulfate via continuous venous infusion was precluded by toxic effects,
more prolonged administration of tolerable doses either via continuous venous
infusion or by subcutaneous injection
may be required. another possibility is
that because of redundancy in the
cytokines affecting angiogenesis, inhibition of basic fgf and other factors
by  xxxd2878xxx  is insufficient
by itself to induce a clinical effect on
kaposi's sarcoma. it is also possible
that kaposi's sarcoma can progress to a
stage where its growth is independent
of exogenous cytokines. further research into the pathogenesis of kaposi's sarcoma may help clarify these
issues. finally, it is possible that
administration of this agent and/or of
other agents that act via inhibition of
angiogenesis and tumor neovascularization may not result in the regression of
pre-existing lesions. rather, their main
effect may be in preventing the development of new lesions. thus, as
these agents enter into clinical trials,
we may need to re-examine the criteria
used for evaluating their activity.
 xxxd2878xxx  was generally
well tolerated by patients. in accordance with previous studies of this drug,
reversible increases in the activated
partial thromboplastin times and thrombocytopenia were identified as doselimiting toxic effects. however, thrombocytopenia was more of a problem in
this study than had previously been
reported (15,40,41). every patient developed some decrease in platelet
counts, and thrombocytopenia was one
of the principal dose-limiting toxic
effects. the exact mechanism of the
thrombocytopenia is unclear. a process

mediated by antibodies similar to that
seen with heparin has been identified in
patients receiving  xxxd2878xxx 
(40-42). however, studies performed in
our patients and previously reported
showed a dose-dependent reduction in
platelet numbers, which would argue
against an immunologic mechanism
(43). in addition,  xxxd2878xxx 
in vivo and in vitro resulted in
abnormal platelet function, as manifested by a decreased or absent platelet
response to thrombin or collagen (43).
gel filtration, which effectively removes  xxxd2878xxx  from platelets, reversed these aggregation abnormalities, suggesting that they resulted
from a direct reversible effect on
platelets (43).

it should also be noted that the
activated partial thromboplastin times
continued to rise in some patients
receiving continuous venous infusion of
a fixed dose of  xxxd2878xxx 
throughout the period of administration.
although the mechanism of this effect
is unclear, it suggests that continued
monitoring of levels may be necessary
even when the administered dose remains constant.
at concentrations of 4 p.g/ml or
higher,  xxxd2878xxx  has been
reported to be an inhibitor of hiv in
vitro (22-25). it has also been reported
that at concentrations of less than 1
(jlg/ml,  xxxd2878xxx  may actually increase in vitro hiv replication,
possibly by stimulating lympho-

proliferation (24). however, even at
these low concentrations, pentosan
polysulfate appears to enhance the
antiretroviral activity of azt in vitro
(24). we did not see any effect of
 xxxd2878xxx  on hiv replication
in our patients. two previous studies
(44,45), in which  xxxd2878xxx 
was administered orally to patients with
hiv infection, also failed to demonstrate any substantial anti-hiv activity.
however, these studies did not note
any toxicity attributable to pentosan
polysulfate, and, in light of reports of
the poor oral bioavailability of this
drug (46), it is likely that only very
low concentrations were attained. it is
noteworthy that our failure to observe
p24 changes with  xxxd2878xxx 
contrasts somewhat with the findings
obtained with a similar compound,
 xxxd1860xxx , which, when given
parenterally, actually induced increases
in hiv p24 antigen in patients (47).
although we assessed the effect of
 xxxd2878xxx  on parameters of
hiv replication, we were more interested in its effect on kaposi's sarcoma.
as noted, no demonstrable activity of
 xxxd2878xxx  against kaposi's
sarcoma was observed. however, in
spite of this result, we believe that the
administration of angiogenesis inhibitors for the treatment of hiv-associated
kaposi's sarcoma is worth exploring
further as a therapeutic modality. other
drugs similar in structure to pentosan
polysulfate but having a better
therapeutic index or improved toxicity
profile have now been identified. one
of these, a naturally occurring sulfated
peptidoglycan (sp-pg) that can inhibit
kaposi's sarcoma spindle cell growth
in vitro, is nearing clinical testing (21).
other angiogenesis inhibitors having a
completely different structure are also
under investigation. one of these, a
 xxxd2166xxx  analogue called 0-(chloroacetylcarbamoyl) fumigillol ( xxxd1330xxx ,
 xxxd1330xxx ), has been shown to inhibit
a number of tumors implanted in nude
mice (48). the nci and the aids
clinical trial group of the national
institute of allergy and infectious
diseases have both intitiated phase i
studies administering  xxxd1330xxx  to patients with hiv-associated kaposi's
sarcoma.

reports

background: during the 1970s, the
papanicolaou method of classifying
cervical cytology specimens and reporting diagnoses was replaced by
more descriptive reporting systems.
the plethora of reporting terms
caused much confusion and a lack of
standardization. to improve this situation, "the bethesda system for
reporting cervical/vaginal cytologic
diagnoses" was approved at a national cancer institute workshop in
1988. in australia, the victorian
cervical cytology registry (vccr)
was established in 1989. because of
the absence of a standard format for
reporting cervical cytology in that
country, a coding schedule was developed by local cytopathologists. while
the pattern of reporting smear diagnoses was found to be reasonably
consistent within individual laboratories, substantial variation in reporting abnormal cervical smear diagnoses by 29 laboratories in victoria,
australia, was observed. in 1992, a
working party of the national health
and medical research council of
australia proposed that a modified
bethesda system be adopted by australian laboratories. purpose: the
aim of this study was to promote
more uniform reporting of cervical/
vaginal cytologic diagnoses by
cytopathology laboratories in victoria, australia. methods: from the
computer database, vccr staff identified 80 slides that had been registered during the first half of 1991
and that covered the range of lowgrade reports and negative reports.
each slide was identified by research
number only. two sets of 40 slides
were compiled. of the 29 laboratories that had worked with the vccr
during 1991, 22 agreed to participate
in this study in 1992. one slide set
was sent to each laboratory. an
evaluation of the intralaboratory and

during the 1950s and 1960s, diagnoses of cervical cytology specimens
were generally reported according to
the five classes of the papanicolaou
classification (7). the simple coding
system was replaced during the 1970s
by more descriptive reporting that used
such terms as benign atypia, koilocytic
atypia, dyskaryosis, dysplasia, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. this
plethora of reporting terms resulted in
what has been called "diagnostic
chaos" (2). in an attempt to improve
this situation, the bethesda system for
reporting cervical/vaginal cytologic
diagnoses was approved at a national
cancer institute workshop in 1988 (j).
use of the bethesda system has
increased substantially year by year

improving consistency in
cervical cytology reporting

interlaboratory consistency in reporting a set of 40 slides was undertaken.
analysis of the results compared the
degree of consistency using current
descriptive terminology that operates
locally in victoria with that which
would pertain if the proposed australian modification to the bethesda
system were adopted. results: intralaboratory agreement with previously
reported slides was low on the
squamous descriptor (49% agreement with original report) but higher
on the human papillomavirus descriptor (76% agreement with original report) when the results were
analyzed using the current terminology. wide variation in reporting was
apparent between laboratories; only
5% of the slides had agreement by
all laboratories. both intralaboratory
and interlaboratory agreement improved substantially when results
were grouped into the categories of
the proposed australian modification
of the bethesda reporting system.
conclusion and implication: substantial improvement in the consistency
of reporting cervical cytology specimens would be likely if terminology
incorporating the broad categories of
the bethesda system were adopted.
