1 the mechanism of contraction to noradrenaline (pec5o 5.6 + 0.1) in the rat epididymal vas deferens
(mediated via xila-adrenoceptors) has been studied in functional experiments.
2 contractions to noradrenaline  xxxd1891xxx -6m were potentiated by the diacylglycerol (dag) kinase
inhibitor r 59022 (3 x 1o-7m) from 49 + 4% to 63 + 3% maximum response and the time taken from
initiation of contraction to the maximum response was reduced from 16+2 s to 9+1 s. the same
contractions were not significantly potentiated by the dag lipase inhibitor, u-57,908, 10-5m (51+2%
control and 53 + 4% in the presence of u-57,908) nor was the time taken from initiation of contraction
to the maximum response significantly altered (17+ 1 s control and 16 + 1 s in the presence of u-57,908).
3 concentration-dependent contractions to noradrenaline (na) were reduced by  xxxd3241xxx  (10-7m)
and the selective protein kinase c inhibitor, calphostin c (10-6m) from 68 + 2% (na, 3 x 10-6m) to
28+2% and 20+2% respectively and from 94+2% (na, 3 x 10-5m) to 50+2% and 44+2%
respectively. contractions to k+ (40+2% maximum response to na) were also significantly reduced by
 xxxd3241xxx  (10-7m) (35+2%) but not by calphostin c (43+3%).
4 the  xxxd2925xxx , phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu), produced a phasic, concentration-dependent
contraction (10-7m- 10-4m) which was 41 +2% of the maximum response to na  xxxd1891xxx -4m pdbu. the
contraction to pdbu (10-5m) was reduced by calphostin c (10-6m) from 33 + 5% to 4 + 1% maximum
response to na.
5 non-cumulative contractions to na (10-8m- 10-4m) were abolished in ca2+-free krebs solution
containing egta (1 mm) and were reduced in the presence of nifedipine (10-6m) in normal krebs
solution by 91+2%  xxxd1891xxx -4m na. the contraction to pdbu (10-5m, 33 + 5% maximum response to
na) was also abolished in ca2+-free krebs solution containing egta (1 mm) or by the presence of
nifedipine (10-6m) in normal krebs solution.
6 when na (10-4m) was added to vasa deferentia in ca2+-free krebs solution containing egta
(1 mm), following its wash out (and with egta later removed from the krebs solution), readdition of
ca2+ (2.5 mm) to the krebs solution produced no response.  xxxd1780xxx  (10-5m), which can
deplete ca2 + from intracellular stores, also produced no contraction. therefore influx of extracellular
ca2 + is not a consequence of depletion of intracellular ca2+ stores (capacitative ca2 + influx).
7 pre-incubation of tissues for 30 min with either  xxxd1780xxx  (10-5m) or ryanodine (10-4m),
which can both deplete intracellular ca2 + stores, did not reduce the contractions to na (3 x 10-6m). preincubation of vasa deferentia with  xxxd1780xxx  (1 or 3 min, when any rise in [ca2+], produced by
 xxxd1780xxx  might still exist) did not potentiate the contraction to pdbu (10-5m). thus
mobilization of intracellular ca2+ may not be required for the activation of protein kinase c involved in
these contractions.
8 in conclusion, the contraction of the rat epididymal vas deferens to na mediated by aiaadrenoceptors appears to depend upon activation of protein kinase c by diacylglycerol, resulting in the
influx of extracellular ca2+ through voltage-gated ca2+ channels. there was no evidence for a role of
inositol trisphosphate in the contraction to noradrenaline in this tissue.

introduction
stimulation of a1-adrenoceptors can mediate contraction of
smooth muscle by raising [ca2+], (for review see minneman &
esbenshade, 1994). these g-protein coupled receptors are
linked to the activation of phospholipase c which hydrolyses
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2), to inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (1p3), and diacylglycerol (dag). ip3 can mobilize ca2" from intracellular stores (berridge, 1993), while

author for correspondence.

dag can activate protein kinase c (pkc) (lee & severson,

1994).

the rise in [ca2+]j through mobilization of ca2+ from intracellular stores by ip3 is transient but it can be associated
with a more prolonged rise in [ca2+]i due to influx of extracellular ca2" which is stimulated in some cells by the depletion
of intracellular ca2" stores (fasolato et al., 1994). this mechanism, sometimes called capacitative ca2+ entry (putney,
1986; 1990), has been shown to be involved in the (xb-adrenoceptor mediated contraction of the rat spleen to phenylephrine (burt et al., 1995b).

r.p. burt et al

alternatively, contraction of some smooth muscle tissues
has been shown to involve stimulation of pkc (lee & severson, 1994). pkc was first discovered by inoue et al. (1977)
and was then shown to require both ca2" and phospholipid
for its activation (takai et al., 1979). activation of al-adrenoceptors might therefore result in contraction of smooth
muscle via activation of pkc by dag.
the aim of the present experiments was to investigate the
role of ip3, dag and pkc activation in the ala-adrenoceptor
mediated contraction of the rat epididymal vas deferens to
noradrenaline (aboud et al., 1993; burt et al., 1995a). the
results suggest that noradrenaline contractions are mediated
via dag activation of pkc leading to an influx of extracellular ca2".

methods
male sprague dawley rats between 350-450 g were stunned
and killed by cervical dislocation. the vasa deferentia were
removed into krebs solution (see below), associated blood
vessels and mesentery were dissected away and were then bisected so that only the epididymal portion (15-20 mm in
length) was used. the tissues were suspended in 5 ml tissue
baths containing krebs solution of the following composition
(mm): na'143, k+5.9, ca2+2.5, mg2' 1.2, cl- 128,
hco3-25, hp042- 1.2, s042- 1.2 and glucose 11, at 370c
and bubbled with 95% 02/5% co2. the vasa deferentia were
placed under 0.5 g resting tension and equilibrated for 1 h.
changes in isometric tension were measured with grass ft.03
transducers and recorded by biopac systems inc. mp10ows
for windows.
in all tissues a contraction to noradrenaline (10-4m) was
measured followed by a non-cumulative concentration-effect
curve to noradrenaline (10-8m- 10-4m). in some tissues this
was then followed 30 min later by a second concentrationeffect curve, either as a control or under appropriate experimental conditions. in other tissues, after the first concentration-effect curve to noradrenaline, responses to noradrenaline
at 1 x 10-6m, 3 x 10-'m or 3 x 10-5m were then repeated at
either 30 min or 60 min intervals until responses were reproducible. only one concentration and one time interval was
used for each tissue. a final response to noradrenaline was
then measured either as a control or under appropriate experimental conditions. the effect of  xxxd3000xxx  (10-7m) on
contractions to k+, 60 mm (by addition of kcl solution to the
tissue bath) was measured in some tissues. contractions to k+
(60 mm) were then measured, always in the presence of  xxxd3000xxx  (10-7m), at 30 min or 60 min intervals until the responses were reproducible. they were then used as controls
where appropriate for the experiments involving noradrenaline. control responses to noradrenaline (3 x 10-6m and
3 x 10-5m) and k+ (60 mm) were also measured in the presence of dimethylsulphoxide (dmso, 0.1%), which was used
to dissolve  xxxd3241xxx , calphostin c, r59022, u-57,908 and
 xxxd1780xxx .
the contraction to noradrenaline (10-6m) was measured
either in the presence of the dag kinase inhibitor, r 59022
(3 x 10-7m, 30 min incubation) or the dag lipase inhibitor,
u-57,908 (10-5m, 30 min incubation). contractions to noradrenaline (3 x 10-6m and 3 x 10-5m) and the contraction to
k+ (60 mm) were measured either in the presence of the nonselective protein kinase inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx  (10-7m, 30 min
incubation) or the selective pkc inhibitor, calphostin c
(10-6m, 1 h incubation). calphostin c was used in a bright
light environment as this is essential for its activity (bruns et
al., 1991).
the  xxxd2925xxx , phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu), was
added to some tissues (10-7m- 10-4m, one concentration per
tissue) in normal krebs solution 40 min after the initial
noradrenaline concentration-effect curve. the response to
pdbu (10-5m) was also measured in the presence of calphostin c (10-6m, 1 h incubation). pdbu (3 x 10-5m) was

pre-incubated with some tissues for 2 h before a repeat response to either noradrenaline (10-4m) or k+ (60 mm) was
measured.
contractions induced by non-cumulative additions to noradrenaline (10-'m- 10 -m) were measured in ca2 +-free krebs
solution containing egta (1 mm). after the initial concentration-effect curve (in normal krebs solution) the tissue
was allowed to recover for 15 min in normal krebs solution
followed by 15 min equilibration in ca2+-free krebs solution
(containing egta, 1 mm) before the start of the second curve
with concentrations given in ascending order. in other tissues
the effect of a single addition of noradrenaline (10-4m) was
measured immediately following the 15 min equilibration in
ca2+-free krebs solution (containing egta, 1 mm) to see if
the response to a high concentration of noradrenaline was
affected by a gradual depletion of intracellular ca2+ which
could not be replenished during the non-cumulative additions
of noradrenaline. a concentration-effect curve to noradrenaline (in normal krebs solution) was also measured in the
presence of nifedipine (10-6m, 20 min equilibration). some
responses to pdbu (1o-5m) were also measured either in ca2"free krebs solution (containing egta, 1 mm) or in the presence of nifedipine (10-6m, 20 min equilibration in normal
krebs solution).
to see if any influx of extracellular ca2+ was stimulated by
depletion of intracellular ca2+ stores, 20 min after the single
addition of noradrenaline (10-4m) in ca2"-free krebs solution
the agonist was washed out for another 40 min still in ca2+free krebs solution (containing egta, 1 mm) so that the
concentrations of any second messengers generated by a,adrenoceptor stimulation were no longer raised. however, the
intracellular ca2+ stores should remain depleted as there was
no extracellular ca2+ available to enter and refill them. egta
was removed from the krebs solution for the last 20 min. ca2"
(2.5 mm) was then added to the krebs solution and any response to this was measured. the endoplasmic reticulum
ca2+-atpase inhibitor,  xxxd1780xxx  (10-5m) was also
added to some tissues in normal krebs solution 40 min after
the initial concentration-effect curve to noradrenaline.
in other tissues the effect of  xxxd1780xxx  (10-5m,
30 min incubation) or ryanodine (10-4m, 30 min incubation)
was measured on the contraction to noradrenaline (3 x 10-6m)
in normal krebs solution. the effect of pre-incubating some
tissues with  xxxd1780xxx  (10-5m) for either 1 or 3 min
was also measured on the response to pdbu (10-5m).

data analysis
the results were calculated as percentage maximum response
of the initial concentration-effect curve to noradrenaline. responses were then plotted as the mean of at least four separate
experiments with vertical bars representing standard error of
the mean (s.e.mean). error bars appear on figures only when
they exceed the symbol size. curve fitting for the calculation of
pec50 values by non linear regression was performed using
inplot (graphpad software, san diego, calif., u.s.a.).
statistical significance of differences between control and test
means was tested for on raw data by a paired t test except for
comparison of means for the pdbu responses where an unpaired t test was used. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
statistical analysis was performed using instat (graphpad
software, san diego, calif., u.s.a.).

drugs and solutions
noradrenaline bitartrate and nifedipine were obtained from
sigma.  xxxd3241xxx , calphostin c, r 59022 [6-(2-(4-((p-

fluorophenyl)phenylmethylene)-i-piperidinyl) ethyl)-7-methyl5h- thiazolo(3,2-a)pyrimidine-5-one], u-57,908 [1,6-bis- (cyclohexyloximinocarbonylamino)-hexane], phorbol- 12,13-dibutyrate, ryanodine and  xxxd1780xxx  were obtained from

central research, kent. noradrenaline was dissolved in distilled water, nifedipine was dissolved in ethanol and then diluted in distilled water and both were prepared fresh each day.
ryanodine was dissolved in distilled water and frozen. all
other compounds were dissolved as stock solutions in dmso
and frozen, with subsequent dilutions made in dmso except
for  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride, r 59022 and u-57,908, which were
made in distilled water.

results
noradrenaline (10-4m) produced a maximal contraction in the
rat epididymal vas deferens (2.72 + 0.12 g, n =8, mean +
s.e.mean, figure 1) and the non-cumulative concentration-effect curves were reproducible (pec50 5.6 + 0.1 for the first
curve and 5.6 + 0.1 for the second curve). contractions to k+
(60 mm) were reduced by  xxxd3000xxx  (10-7m) from 53 + 2% to
40 + 2% indicating some neuronal release of noradrenaline and

therefore subsequently  xxxd3000xxx  (l0-7m) was added prior to all
other additions of high k+ solution. dmso (0.1%) had no
effect on the contractions to noradrenaline or k+.
contractions to noradrenaline  xxxd1891xxx -6m were potentiated
by the dag kinase inhibitor, r 59022 (3 x i0-7m) from
49 + 4% to 63 + 3% maximum response (p< 0.05) (figure 2a)
and the time taken from initiation of contraction to the maximum response was reduced from 16 + 2 s to 9 + 1 s (p<0.05)
(figure 2a). contractions to k+ (60 mm) were not potentiated
by r 59022, 3 x 10-7m (control, 38 + 2% maximum response
to noradrenaline and 35+2% maximum response in the presence of r 59022, representing a significant reduction,
p< 0.05) and the time taken from initiation of contraction to
the maximum response was not significantly different
(6.0 + 0.6 s control and 5.8 + 0.5 s in the presence of r 59022).
contractions to noradrenaline were not significantly potentiated by the dag lipase inhibitor, u-57,908, 1o-5m
(51 + 2% control and 53 + 4% in the presence of u-57,908) and
the time taken from initiation of contraction to the maximum
response was not significantly different (17 + 1 s control and
16+ 1 s in the presence of u-57,908) (figure 2b).
the control contraction to noradrenaline at 3 x 10-6m was
68+2% maximum response and was reduced to 28+2% of
the maximum (p <0.05) by  xxxd3241xxx  (10-7m) and to
20+2% of the maximum (p<0.05) by calphostin c (10-6m)
(figure 3a). the control contraction to noradrenaline at
3 x 10-sm was 94+2% maximum response and was reduced to
50 + 2% of the maximum (p< 0.05) by  xxxd3241xxx  (10-7m)
and to 44+2% of the maximum (p<0.05) by calphostin c
(10-6m) (figure 3b). the control contraction to k+ (60 mm)
was 40+2% maximum response to noradrenaline and was
35+2% of the maximum (p<0.05) in the presence of  xxxd3241xxx  (10-7m) and 43 + 3% of the maximum (p> 0.05) in
the presence of calphostin c (10-6m).
the  xxxd2925xxx , pdbu, produced a phasic contraction of
the rat epididymal vas deferens returning to baseline within
90 s (figure 1). the pdbu contraction was also concentrationdependent (10-7m- 10-4m) and was 41 + 2% of the maximum
response to noradrenaline at 1o-4m pdbu (figure 4). the
response to pdbu was not reproducible and so only one addition of pdbu was made to each tissue. the submaximal

contraction to pdbu (10-5m) was significantly reduced by the
selective pkc inhibitor, calphostin c (10-6m) from 33+5% to
4 + 1% (p <0.05) maximum response to noradrenaline (figure
5a). the response to noradrenaline 10-4m, was reduced when
the tissue was pre-incubated with pdbu (3 x 10-5m) for 2 h
from 100% to 25 + 2% maximum response (figure 5b) but the
response to k+ 60 mm was not significantly affected by this
treatment (control, 44+3% maximum response to noradrenaline and 42 + 2% after pdbu treatment).
the contractions to noradrenaline (10-8m - 10-4m) were

containing egta (1mm) (results not shown). the responses to
noradrenaline were also greatly reduced in the presence of
nifedipine (10-6m) (figure 6a). the contraction to pdbu
(10-5m) was abolished in ca2 -free krebs solution containing
egta (1 mm) and in the presence of nifedipine (10-6m) in
normal krebs solution (figure 6b).
following the single addition of noradrenaline (10-4m) in
ca2+ -free krebs solution containing egta (1 mm), when the
agonist had been washed out and the egta removed from the
krebs solution, the readdition of ca2+ to the krebs solution
did not produce a response.  xxxd1780xxx  (10-5m) also
failed to produce a response.
the response to noradrenaline at 3 x 10-6m (67+2%
maximum response) was not significantly affected when the
tissues were pre-incubated for 30 min with  xxxd1780xxx 
10-5m (65 + 2% maximum response) or ryanodine 10-4m
(68+2% maximum response). the time for noradrenaline to
reach a maximal effect at 3 x -6m (17±1 s) was also not
_significantly affected by the 30 min pre-incubation with either
 xxxd1780xxx  or ryanodine (18 + 1 s and 17 + 1 s respectively). the contraction to pdbu (10-5m, 33+5% maximum
response to noradrenaline) was not increased when  xxxd1780xxx  was added to the tissues either 1 or 3 min prior to
the addition of pdbu (31+2% and 32+2% maximum response to noradrenaline respectively).

al-adrenoceptor stimulation has been shown to increase the
formation of inositol phosphates in various tissues including
the rat vas deferens (fox et al., 1985) and this should therefore
be
by dag formation. dag can be metabolized
in cells via two main pathways, being converted either to
phosphatidic acid by dag kinase (bishop & bell, 1986; kanoh et al., 1993) or to  xxxd208xxx  by dag lipase (severson & hee-cheong, 1986). the activity of one or both of
these enzymes is therefore at least partly responsible for attenuating pkc activity in response to dag formation. to see

if the pkc activity involved in the noradrenaline contraction
of this tissue was stimulated by formation of dag the effect of
inhibitors of dag kinase and dag lipase were investigated.
the dag kinase inhibitor, r 59022 (de chaffoy de corcelles
et al., 1985) significantly increased the magnitude and rate of
the noradrenaline contraction but not the k+ contraction,
while the dag lipase inhibitor, u-57,908 (yang et al., 1991)
had no significant effect. this suggests that the pkc activity
involved in the noradrenaline contraction is stimulated by
production of dag, which in this tissue is metabolized by
dag kinase but not dag lipase. however as the pdbu
contraction in the vas was also phasic (see below) this suggests
that other mechanisms are involved in attenuating the noradrenaline response as well as dag metabolism.
as dag can stimulate pkc, the role of this enzyme was
investigated. the pkc inhibitor, calphostin c (over 100 fold
selectivity for pkc over other protein kinases, kobayashi et
al., 1989) significantly reduced contractions to noradrenaline
in the epididymal vas deferens at a concentration which did not
inhibit the contractions to k+. this suggests that pkc activation is involved in the contraction of the rat epididymal vas
deferens to noradrenaline. the relatively non-selective protein
kinase inhibitor  xxxd3241xxx  (tamaoki et al., 1986) significantly reduced the noradrenaline contractions and also
significantly reduced the k+ contractions but to a lesser extent.
this is in agreement with shimamoto et al. (1993), who reported that contractions in the rat aorta to both phenylephrine
and k+ were reduced by  xxxd3241xxx  while only those to
phenylephrine were inhibited by calphostin c. abraham &
rice (1992) found the protein kinase inhibitor, iso-h7, reduced
both noradrenaline and k +-induced contractions in the rat vas
deferens. they suggested that pkc was therefore a common
site of activation in both contractions resulting from the increased [ca2+], in both responses. however the results with
calphostin c (see above) suggest the effect of iso-h7 on contractions to k+ in the rat vas deferens (abraham & rice, 1992)
was not due to pkc inhibition.
phorbol esters are known to activate pkc by binding to
the dag binding site (castagna et al., 1982). the effect of the
 xxxd2925xxx , pdbu, was therefore studied in the rat epididymal vas deferens. pdbu produced a concentration- xxxd2870xxx -

dent contraction of the tissue which was phasic, similar to the
noradrenaline response, but produced a smaller maximum
response (41 + 2%) compared to noradrenaline. the contraction to pdbu was also significantly reduced by calphostin c
confirming that the effect of the  xxxd2925xxx  is mediated by
stimulation of pkc. abraham & rice (1992) found that
phorbol-12,13-diacetate and pdbu produced contractions less
than 6% maximum response to noradrenaline in the rat vas
deferens. the reason for this difference is not clear although it
is not stated whether they used the whole vas or just the
epididymal or prostatic portion. the magnitude of the responses to noradrenaline reported by abraham & rice (1992)
however suggests a predominantly prostatic portion was used.
incubation of tissues with phorbol esters can also cause
down regulation of pkc (merkel et al., 1991) and the response
to noradrenaline in the rat epididymal vas deferens was significantly reduced by this treatment with pdbu in the present
experiments, but it did not affect the k+ contraction. this also
suggests pkc activity is involved in the noradrenaline contraction.
as hydrolysis of pip2 by plc also produces ip3. the possibility that release of ca2+ from intracellular stores also
contributes to the noradrenaline contraction in the rat epididymal vas deferens was studied. non-cumulative contractions
to noradrenaline in this tissue were completely abolished in
ca2+ -free krebs solution and almost completely abolished in
the presence of nifedipine in agreement with han et al. (1987).
a single high concentration of noradrenaline in ca2+ -free
krebs solution also failed to produce a response showing that
the lack of response to noradrenaline was not due to a gradual
depletion of ca2+ from intracellular stores (by individual doses
of increasing concentration) which could not be replenished
and therefore could not initiate contraction. this shows that
the contraction is completely dependent on influx of extracellular ca2+ through voltage-gated ca2+ channels and mobilization of intracellular ca2+ does not contribute directly to
the contraction. the contraction to pdbu was also completely
abolished in ca2 +-free krebs solution and in the presence of
nifedipine, confirming that activation of pkc mediates a
contraction via influx of extracellular ca2 + through voltagegated ca2+ channels.

r.p. burt et al
it has been suggested by bultmann et al. (1993) that the
adrenergic component of neurogenic contractions in the rat
vas deferens are mediated in part by mobilization of [ca2+]i in
the smooth muscle as these responses are inhibited in the
presence of ryanodine. however ryanodine does not reduce
contractions to exogenous noradrenaline in these experiments
(see later), in agreement with bourreau et al. (1991). the reason for this difference is not clear.
it might be possible however that ca2+ release from intracellular stores by ip3 in this tissue, while not being sufficient
alone to initiate contraction, might still stimulate capacitative
ca2" influx which could then be partially responsible for the
contraction. if this were the case then when the tissue had been
stimulated by noradrenaline (and then washed out) in ca2+free krebs solution the intracellular stores should remain depleted so that upon addition of extracellular ca2", capacitative
ca2+ influx would still occur resulting in a contraction.
however there was no response in this tissue to the readdition
of ca2" showing that this mechanism of ca2" influx does not
exist in the response to noradrenaline. this is unlike the rat
spleen where readdition of ca2+ after stimulation of albadrenoceptors with phenylephrine did produce a contraction
(burt et al., 1995b). also,  xxxd1780xxx , which can deplete ca2" from intracellular stores by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2 -atpase (seidler et al., 1989; deng &
kwan, 1991) and therefore stimulate capacitative ca2+ influx
in tissues where this mechanism exists, had no effect in the rat
epididymal vas deferens at a concentration which produced a
maximal contraction in the rat spleen (burt et al., 1995b). this
confirmed that capacitative ca2+ influx cannot be stimulated
in the rat epididymal vas deferens.
both ca2"-dependent and -independent isoforms of pkc
have been identified (lee & severson, 1994). it is possible
therefore that following hydrolysis of pip2, ip3 which is released into the cytosol, raises [ca2+]i producing a translocation
of pkc to the membrane (haller et al., 1990) where dag,
which remains membrane bound, can then also bind to pkc
resulting in its full activation. (this mechanism might occur
even though noradrenaline in ca2+ -free krebs solution failed
to produce a response as the rise in [ca2+]i, may not be great
enough to initiate contraction). this could also be a reason
why activation of pkc by pdbu could not produce the same
maximal response as that to noradrenaline. some tissues were
therefore pre-incubated with  xxxd1780xxx  for 30 min
before addition of noradrenaline. this treatment should deplete ca2+ from intracellular stores and therefore this would
not be available for release by ip3 in the noradrenaline response. the length of the incubation time for cyclopiazonic
acid with the tissue should ensure than any rise in [ca2+]i
produced by this compound had returned to resting levels
before addition of the noradrenaline. however pre-incubation
with  xxxd1780xxx  did not affect either the magnitude or
rate of rise of the noradrenaline contraction in this tissue.
other tissues were pre-incubated with  xxxd1780xxx  for
either 1 or 3 min prior to the addition of pdbu, when any rise
in [ca2+], produced by  xxxd1780xxx  might still exist. this
did not however potentiate the pdbu contraction. some cells
have also been shown to have intracellular ca21 stores which
are insensitive to ip3 but are sensitive to ryanodine (sorrentino
& volpe, 1993; ehrlich et al., 1994) and ryanodine binding sites
have been demonstrated in the rat vas deferens (bourreau et
al., 1991). however, ryanodine at a concentration shown to
abolish increases in [ca2 +], produced by noradrenaline in
rabbit mesenteric artery (itoh et al., 1992), had no effect on the
noradrenaline contraction in the rat epididymal vas deferens.
these results suggest that release of intracellular ca2+ by ip3
(or by a ryanodine-sensitive mechanism) is not required for the
pkc activity involved in the contraction to noradrenaline.
this could mean that the pkc isoform involved in the contraction of the rat epididymal vas deferens belongs to the
ca2"-independent group. alternatively, dag/ xxxd2925xxx 
binding to pkc might increase the affinity of the enzyme for

noradrenaline contractions in rat vas deferens

figure 7 schematic diagram of the cellular mechanisms proposed to
be involved for the ocia-adrenoceptor mediated contraction to
noradrenaline (na) in the rat epididymal vas deferens, which also
shows the sites of action for compounds used in this study. dag:
diacylglycerol, pa: phosphatidic acid, dk: dag kinase, pkc:
protein kinase c, gdp:  xxxd1248xxx , gtp: guanosine
triphosphate, ip3: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, na: noradrenaline,
pip2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, plc: phospholipase c,
membr: cell membrane, extra: extracellular, intra: intracellular. a
and f3/y are the three subunits of a heterotrimeric g-protein.

ca2+ and therefore a ca2 +-dependent isoform could be involved which does not require a rise in [ca2+], for activation
(castagna et al., 1982).

the maximum response to pdbu being less than that to
noradrenaline could be due to the time pdbu takes to diffuse
into the tissue, or pdbu might be a 'partial agonist' compared
with dag for the pkc isoform involved. different phorbol
esters can produce varying biological responses in tissues
suggesting that they do have some isoform selectivity (ryves et
al., 1991) and different species of dag may also have pkc
isoform selectivity (nishizuka, 1986; ford et al., 1989).
these results show that the ala-adrenoceptor-mediated
contraction of the rat epididymal vas deferens (aboud et al.,
1993; burt et al., 1995a) involves different cellular mechanisms
compared with the alb-adrenoceptor-mediated contraction of
the rat spleen, which does not involve pkc but is mediated via
capacitative ca2+ influx (burt et al., 1995b). it is unlikely
however that each subtype is always linked to the same mechanism as the cla-adrenoceptor mediated contraction of the
human prostate (marshall et al., 1995) does not involve activation of pkc (unpublished observations). contractions to
phenylephrine in the rat aorta mediated predominantly by aldadrenoceptors (goetz et al., 1995) partly involve activation of
pkc (shimamoto et al., 1993). it may be that cellular processes involved after pip2 hydrolysis are more tissue rather
than receptor subtype-dependent as the  xxxg2240xxx -mediated contraction to  xxxg2240xxx  in the rat epididymal vas deferens,
like that to noradrenaline, may involve activation of pkc by
dag (burt et al., 1993).
figure 7 is a schematic diagram showing the cellular mechanisms that it is proposed may be involved in the contraction
of the rat epididymal vas deferens to noradrenaline. it shows
the ala-adrenoceptor mediated contraction is dependent on
activation of pkc by dag produced from plc-mediated
hydrolysis of pip2, which results in an influx of extracellular
ca2+ through voltage-gated ca2+ channels. no evidence for
inositol trisphosphate involvement in the contraction was
found.
