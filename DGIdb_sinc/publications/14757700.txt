1  xxxg2334xxx  (cmr1) is a ca2 þ -permeable channel, which can be activated by low temperatures,
 xxxd2565xxx , eucalyptol and icilin. it belongs to the transient receptor potential (trp) family, and
therefore is related to  xxxd428xxx  receptor type-1 ( xxxg2335xxx , trpv1). we tested whether substances which
are structurally related to  xxxd2565xxx , or which produce a cooling sensation, could activate  xxxg2334xxx , and
compared the responses of  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx  to these ligands.
2 the effects of 70 odorants and  xxxd2565xxx -related substances on recombinant mouse  xxxg2334xxx 
(mtrpm8), expressed in hek293 cells, were examined using a fliprs assay. in all, 10 substances
(linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, ws-3, ws-23, frescolatmga, frescolatml, pmd38, coolactp and cooling agent 10) were found to be agonists.

eucalyptol (7.772.0 mm) 4 hydroxycitronellal (19.672.2 mm).
4 known  xxxg2335xxx  antagonists (bctc, thio-bctc and capsazepine) were also able to block the
response of  xxxg2334xxx  to  xxxd2565xxx  (ic50: 0.871.0, 3.571.1 and 1871.1 mm, respectively).
5 the ca2 þ response of hvr1-transfected hek293 cells to the endogenous  xxxg2335xxx  agonist narachidonoyl-dopamine was potentiated by low ph. in contrast,  xxxd2565xxx - and icilin-activated
 xxxg2334xxx  currents were suppressed by low ph.
6 in conclusion, in the present study, we identified 10 new agonists and three antagonists of  xxxg2334xxx .
we found that, in contrast to  xxxg2335xxx ,  xxxg2334xxx  is inhibited rather than potentiated by protons.

introduction
the recent cloning and characterization of the cold- xxxd2565xxx 
receptor ( xxxg2334xxx ; cmr1) (mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al.,
2002) was a major breakthrough in the study of thermosensation.  xxxg2334xxx  is activated by  xxxd2565xxx , eucalyptol and icilin,
and by temperatures below b251c. it belongs to the ‘long’, or
melastatin, subfamily of the transient receptor potential (trp)
family of ion channels (montell et al., 2002), and shows
pronounced outward rectification with a relatively high
permeability for ca2 þ ions, and little selectivity between
monovalent cations. the  xxxg2334xxx  channel is expressed
specifically in a subset of temperature-sensing trigeminal and

dorsal root ganglion neurones (peier et al., 2002; reid et al.,
2002a, b; nealen et al., 2003). recently, a second cold receptor,
 xxxg2331xxx , has been identified (story et al., 2003), which, in
contrast to  xxxg2334xxx , is coexpressed with  xxxg2335xxx  in a different
subset of pain- and temperature-sensing trigeminal and dorsal
root ganglion neurones.  xxxg2331xxx  is activated by icilin, but not
 xxxd2565xxx . these trp channels play a major role in thermosensation (mckemy et al., 2002; patapoutian et al., 2003).
although treatment with  xxxd2565xxx  or eucalyptol, or with
cold temperatures, is a traditional method of pain relief
(wright, 1870; green & mcanliffe, 2000; davies et al., 2002;
galeotti et al., 2002; shanghai medicinal herbs, essential
balm), little is known about the underlying  xxxd2565xxx  mechanisms. it has been demonstrated that  xxxd2565xxx  blocks na þ and
ca2 þ channels in dorsal root ganglion cells (swandulla et al.,

738

h.-j. behrendt et al

1987; haeseler et al., 2002). others have postulated that the
 xxxd2565xxx  activity of (–) xxxd2565xxx  is mediated by selective
activation of k-opioid receptors (galeotti et al., 2002).
the cold receptor  xxxg2334xxx  is distantly related to the wellcharacterized heat-sensitive  xxxd428xxx  receptor  xxxg2335xxx  (or
trpv1).  xxxg2335xxx  also belongs to the trp channel family, but
is activated by temperatures 4421c, or by ligands such as
capsaicin and  xxxd3101xxx  (rtx). two endogenous  xxxg2335xxx 
agonists have been identified, anandamide (ana) and narachidonoyl-dopamine (nada) (zygmunt et al., 1999; di
marzo et al., 2001; huang et al., 2002). various  xxxg2335xxx 
antagonists have also been reported, for example, capsazepine,
iodo- xxxd3101xxx  (i-rtx) and n-(4-tert.butyl-phenyl)-4-(3chloropyridin-2-yl) tetrahydro-pyrazine-1(2h)-carboxamide
(bctc). these have  xxxd2565xxx  effects in vivo (bevan et al.,
1992; walpole et al., 1994; catarina et al., 1997; 2000;
tominaga et al., 1998; wahl et al., 2001; pomonis et al.,
2003; rigoni et al., 2003).
protons act as endogenous activators and modulators of
 xxxg2335xxx  responses. low ph enhances the apparent  xxxg2335xxx -binding
affinity of capsaicin, and potentiates the channel gating of
 xxxg2335xxx  receptors (caterina et al., 1997; 2000; tominaga et al.,
1998; olah et al., 2001; ryu et al., 2003). since inflammation
leads to acidification of the inflamed tissue,  xxxg2335xxx  is thought to
play a major role in the transduction of inflammatory pain.
as  xxxg2335xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  are distantly related, and no
antagonists have been described for  xxxg2334xxx , we tested the
effects of  xxxg2335xxx  antagonists on  xxxg2334xxx . further, we investigated whether the responses of  xxxg2335xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  towards
agonists are influenced by ph.

methods
materials
hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss), phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) and all cell culture reagents were obtained from
invitrogen (karlsruhe, germany). () xxxd2565xxx , capsaicin,
capsazepine, ruthenium red, eugenol, 4a-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4a-pdd) and probenecid were obtained from sigmaaldrich (taufkirchen, germany). ( þ ) xxxd2565xxx  was purchased
from fluka-sigma-aldrich (taufkirchen, germany). linalool,
hydrocitronellal and citronellal were obtained from henkel
(düsseldorf, germany). ws-3 was obtained from givaudan
(dubendorf, switzerland). icilin was purchased from tocris
(ellisville, mo, u.s.a.). frescolat ml and mga were
obtained from haarmann & reimer gmbh (holzminden,
germany). ws-23 was obtained from millennium chemicals
(jacksonville, fl, u.s.a.). cooling agent 10, coolact p and
pmd38 were obtained from takasago (paris, france). bctc
and thio-bctc (n-(4-tert.-butyl-phenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2yl) tetrahydropyrazine-1(2h)-(thio) carboxamide) were synthesized according to published methods, and tested as free bases
(pomonis et al., 2003).

characterization of  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 

of the pcdna5-vector (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany), as
described previously (peier et al., 2002). the hvr1 cdna
(genbank accession aj272063) was cloned in pcdna3.1 in a
manner similar to that described previously (hayes et al., 2000;
smart et al., 2000). hek 293 cells were transiently transfected
with mtrpm8 and hvr1 using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

cell culture
hek293 cells were routinely grown as monolayers in
minimum essential medium (mem) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum and 0.2 mm lglutamine, and maintained under 95% o2 / 5% co2 at 371c.

measurement of [ca2 þ ]i using the fliprs assay
mtrpm8- and hvr1-transfected hek293 cells were seeded
into black-walled clear-base poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well
plates (becton dickinson, meylan cedex, france) at a density
of 25,000 cells per well in mem, supplemented as described
above, and cultured overnight. the cells were then incubated
with mem containing the cytoplasmic calcium indicator fluo4am (4 mm; molecular probes, eugene, oregon, u.s.a.) at
371c for 30 min. the cells were washed twice with hbss
supplemented with 2.5 mm probenecid and 20 mm hepes,
resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated for 15 min at
371c. subsequently, the plates were inserted into a fluorometric imaging plate reader (fliprs; molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca, u.s.a.), and the fluorescence (lex ¼ 488 nm,
lem ¼ 510–570 nm) from [ca2 þ ]i was determined before and
after the addition of various concentrations of test compounds
(sullivan et al., 1999; jerman et al., 2000).
in experiments designed to define the influence of low ph on
mtrpm8 and hvr1 currents in hek293 cells, contributions
from the endogenous hasica (acid-activated channel) are
conceivable. this channel is desensitized by short exposures to
low ph (gunthorpe et al., 2001). consequently, transfected
cells were incubated at ph 6.3 for at least 1 min prior to
measurements.

data analysis
ec50 values were determined as the concentration of test
substance required to produce half-maximal increases in
[ca2 þ ]i. maximal [ca2 þ ]i responses were measured as peak
fluorescence intensity (fi) minus basal fi, and expressed as
percentages of the maximum response to icilin. data are given
as means7s.e.m., unless otherwise stated. curve fitting and
parameter estimations were performed with microsoft excel
97 and graph pad prism 3.01 (graphpad software inc., ca,
u.s.a.).

and 10 mm). of these, 10 (linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, ws-3, ws-23, frescolat mga, frescolat ml, pmd 38,
coolact p and cooling agent 10) produced increases in
[ca2 þ ]i in mtrpm8-transfected hek293 cells, and were
studied in more detail.
various concentrations of these agonists were tested on
mtrpm8-transfected, nontransfected and hvr1-transfected
hek293 cells. all of the identified  xxxg2334xxx  agonists led to
concentration-dependent increases in [ca2 þ ]i in mtrpm8transfected hek293 cells, but not in nontransfected or hvr1transfected hek293 cells (data not shown), proving that the
compounds are specific agonists of mouse  xxxg2334xxx . the
efficacies and potencies of linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, ws-3, ws-23, frescolat mga, frescolat ml, pmd 38,
coolact p and cooling agent 10 are shown in figure 2 and in
table 1.
analysis of the [ca2 þ ]i response curves showed that
application of the agonists led to one of two different types
of ca2 þ influx kinetics in mtrpm8-transfected hek293 cells
(figure 1). for the first group of agonists (icilin,  xxxd2565xxx , ws3, ws-23, frescolat mga, frescolat ml, pmd 38, coolact p
and cooling agent 10), the [ca2 þ ]i response was typified by an
initial very rapid onset (within ca. 1 s) and fast rate of increase.
this reached a peak value after ca. 20–30 s, followed by a
gradual slight decline over the course of the assay (figure 1).
the high [ca2 þ ]i level was maintained for at least 4 min in the
continued presence of the agonists.
the second type of agonist effect was produced by the
odorants linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal and eucalyptol
(figure 1). these induced a slower initial increase in [ca2 þ ]i,
which peaked at roughly the same time as the response to the
first type of agonist, but declined much more rapidly. indeed,

the increase in [ca2 þ ]i above pre-test levels was negligible at
the end of the assay period.

 xxxg2334xxx  agonist potency and efficacy
the ec50 values of the agonists are listed in table 1, ranked by
potency. the order of potency, from the most to least potent
was: icilin (0.270.1 mm) 4 frescolatml (3.371.5 mm) 4 ws-3

linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, ws-3, ws-23, frescolatmga, frescolatml, pmd38, coolactp and cooling agent 10 were
identified as novel partial  xxxg2334xxx  agonists. the efficacies and potencies of mtrpm8 antagonists and agonists are given. changes in
[ca2+]i were measured using the fliprs described in methods (n ¼ 4–8).

coolact p, pmd38 and ws-23 were rather weak agonists, with
substantially reduced efficacies. the odorants linalool, geraniol and hydroxycitronellal were extremely weak agonists
with rather low efficacies (table 1, figure 2).

partial overlap of ligands for  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 
the heat receptor  xxxg2335xxx  is distantly related to  xxxg2334xxx , and is
well characterized as a pain target (caterina et al., 1997; 2000).
for this reason, we investigated whether  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 
have common pharmacological aspects. it was shown that the
 xxxg2335xxx  antagonists capsazepine, bctc and thio-bctc inhibited
the [ca2 þ ]i response of mtrpm8 to 20 mm  xxxd2565xxx  in a

concentration-dependent manner. ic50 values for this inhibition were 1871.1 mm for capsazepine, 0.871.0 mm for bctc
and 3.571.1 mm for thio-bctc, as shown in figure 3.
although these antagonists displayed the same potency
ranking for both hvr1 and mtrpm8 (bctc4thiobctc4capsazepine), their antagonistic potencies for
mtrpm8 were much lower than for the hvr1 receptor
(ic50 mtrpm8 vs hvr1: capsazepine, 1871.1 vs 2.671.2 mm
(smart et al., 2001); thio-bctc, 3.571.1 mm vs 54.37
21.8 nm (data not shown); bctc 0.871.0 mm vs
34.9719.4 nm (valenzano et al., 2003)).
bctc (10 mm) and thio-bctc (10 mm) completely blocked
the mtrpm8 response to 0.5 mm icilin, whereas capsazepine

(30 mm) only blocked 40% of the response. like valenzano et al.
(2003), we were not able to detect any quenching of fluo-4
fluorescence by either bctc or thio-bctc. in contrast to their
antagonism of icilin, neither bctc nor thio-bctc were able to
block the [ca2 þ ]i increase induced by 4a-phorbol 12,13didecanoate (4a-pdd) in htrpv4-transfected hek293 cells;
neither did they inhibit the atp-induced [ca2 þ ]i increase in
cho k1 cells (data not shown). this demonstrates that bctc
and thio-bctc are selective antagonists for certain trp
channels.
interestingly, the  xxxg2335xxx  antagonist i-rtx had no influence
on mtrpm8 currents (data not shown), and neither did the
channel blocker ruthenium red (peier et al., 2002) nor the  xxxg2335xxx 
agonists capsaicin and rtx (data not shown).

ph sensitivity of  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 
protons act as endogenous activators or modulators of  xxxg2335xxx 
(caterina et al., 1997; ryu et al., 2003). when capsaicin
(0.1 mm) was added to hvr1-transfected hek293 cells at ph
6.3, a 1.6-fold increase in ca2 þ flux compared to that at ph 7.5
(figure 4a) was observed. at ph 6.3, the  xxxg2335xxx  response to the
endogenous  xxxg2335xxx  agonists ana and nada was even more
markedly increased, by ca.3.5- to 4.0-fold (figure 4a).
in contrast, the ca2 þ influxes induced by  xxxd2565xxx  and icilin
through mtrpm8 channels were almost completely inhibited
at ph 6.3 (figure 4b); ca2 þ influx was also reduced when the
agonists were applied at ph 8.0 rather than at ph 7.5. thus,
hvr1 and mtrpm8 channels react oppositely to acidic
conditions:  xxxg2335xxx  is potentiated, and  xxxg2334xxx  is inhibited.

discussion and conclusion
 xxxg2334xxx  agonist potency and efficacy
the  xxxg2334xxx  receptor is a transducer of cold stimuli in the
somatosensory system (mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al.,
2002). however, due to the lack of specific and water-soluble

ligands, only a limited pharmacological characterization has
been possible to date. after screening a small library of 70
odorants, and other substances related to  xxxd2565xxx  (eccles, 1994),
we were able to identify 10 novel  xxxg2334xxx  agonists. consistent
with the reported molecular pharmacology of  xxxg2334xxx 
(mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002),  xxxd2565xxx , eucalyptol
and icilin increased [ca2 þ ]i in mtrpm8-transfected hek293
cells in the present study (figure 1; table 1). mckemy et al.
did not specify the optical purity of the  xxxd2565xxx  they used;
in our studies, the 1r,3r,4s form of () xxxd2565xxx  was ca.
3.5-fold more effective than that of ( þ ) xxxd2565xxx  (table 1),
indicating that there is a slight preference for the () enantiomeric form.
some of the identified  xxxg2334xxx  agonists, namely ws-3,
coolact p, cooling agent 10, and pmd38, are used as cooling

h.-j. behrendt et al

agents in the food and cosmetics industry. this cooling
sensation may in part be mediated by  xxxg2334xxx . manufacturers
report the cooling strength of ws-3 to be ca. five-fold, coolact
p ca. four-fold, cooling agent 10 ca. 4.5-fold and pmd38 ca.
9.5-fold greater than that of () xxxd2565xxx . these estimates do
not correlate with our results (table 1). as an agonist for
mtrpm8, ws-3 displayed a slightly higher efficacy and a
similar potency to () xxxd2565xxx , but coolact p and pmd38
displayed equal or lower efficacies and potencies. it is not
unusual for in vitro and in vivo data to be discrepant. probably,
additional factors such as membrane permeability, metabolism, chemical stability, solubility, subjectivity and volatility of
the tested compounds have also to be taken into account
(watson et al., 1978). there may also be differences between
species in the ligand specificity of receptors (here, mouse vs
human). conceivably, these substances also activate other
cold-transducing receptors such as  xxxg2331xxx , which is also
activated by icilin (story et al., 2003). future studies will
address the selectivity of the identified novel  xxxg2334xxx  agonists.
besides  xxxd2565xxx  and eucalyptol, we were able to identify
three novel natural odorants (linalool, geraniol and hydroxycitronellal) that activate the mtrpm8 receptor. these natural
odorants are found in formulations used in aroma therapies,
for example, against headaches (shanghai medicinal herbs,
essential balm).
it is worth noting that an  xxxd2565xxx  effect was reported
recently for the novel  xxxg2334xxx  ligand linalool, and also for
 xxxd2565xxx  (peana et al., 2003). linalool is a fresh, pungent and
flowery odorant found in plants such as convallaria majalis
(lily of the valley) and zingiber officinale (ginger). we also
found agonistic effects on mtrpm8 for geraniol, the main
odorant component of roses, and hydroxycitronellal, a fresh
citrus odorant.
the weak potency and efficacy of these odorants in our in
vitro assays could be partially explained by their hydrophobicity and poor aqueous solubility. the observed concentration
dependance of the responses to geraniol, linalool, eucalyptol
and hydrocitronellal (table 1) was in the same range as that
reported for eucalyptol with  xxxg2334xxx  (ec50: 3.470.4 mm;
mckemy et al., 2002).
the evidence thus shows that  xxxd2565xxx , eucalyptol, icilin and
all of the newly identified agonists can produce cooling
sensations, which may, at least in part, be explained by the
activation of the  xxxg2334xxx  cold receptor. additionally, some of
the compounds described here as agonists for  xxxg2334xxx  have
 xxxd2565xxx  effects in vivo, suggesting a role for  xxxg2334xxx  in pain
relief.

partial overlap of ligands for  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 
the  xxxg2335xxx  antagonists capsazepine, bctc and thio-bctc,
though not i-rtx, inhibited the ca2 þ influx induced through
 xxxg2334xxx  by 20 mm  xxxd2565xxx  in a concentration-dependent
manner. the channel blocker ruthenium red, and the  xxxg2335xxx 
agonists capsaicin and rtx, had no effect on  xxxg2334xxx .
capsaicin, capsazepine, bctc, rtx and i-rtx are supposed
to share the same binding pocket at transmembrane domains
(tm) 2–3 of the  xxxg2335xxx  receptor (jordt & julius, 2002;
valenzano et al., 2003). at the predicted capsaicin-binding
region of  xxxg2335xxx  (tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx , jordt & julius, 2002), the
amino-acid sequence identity of  xxxg2335xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  was 36%,
compared to an overall amino-acid sequence identity of 21%.

characterization of  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 

743

future studies will have to ascertain whether capsazepine,
bctc and thio-bctc interact at a  xxxg2334xxx  site corresponding to the capsaicin-binding site of  xxxg2335xxx .
we have shown here for the first time that capsazepine is an
antagonist of recombinant mtrpm8. interestingly, reid et al.
(2002a) demonstrated that capsazepine is able to block native
cold- and  xxxd2565xxx -induced ca2 þ currents in rat dorsal root
ganglion. this observation might be explained by the fact that
capsazepine inhibits  xxxg2334xxx . our results extend the range of
receptors, such as voltage-gated ca2 þ -channels (docherty
et al., 1997) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (liu &
simon, 1997; wardle et al., 1997), that are known to interact
with capsazepine.
bctc has until now been regarded as a highly specific  xxxg2335xxx 
antagonist, since no interactions with 60 other receptors were
observed in a study by valenzano et al. (2003). however, our
results indicate that bctc also antagonizes  xxxg2334xxx  at
submicromolar concentrations, which has implications for its
use as a specific  xxxg2335xxx  antagonist in vivo. bctc seemed to be a
more specific  xxxg2335xxx  antagonist than capsazepine, as no
interactions with trp channels other than  xxxg2335xxx  have been
published to date. our results show that bctc acts as an
antagonist for  xxxg2334xxx , which may indicate that bctc could
be an inhibitor for other related trp channels.
looking at the chemical structures and potential pharmacophore, the similarities and differences between bctc and
icilin are obvious. both molecules have two aromatic rings and
a urea moiety in common. the distances between these
pharmacophore elements are clearly different, which may
partly explain why icilin acts as an agonist and bctc as an
antagonist. this has to be confirmed with studies using
structural analogues of bctc and icilin.

ph sensitivity of  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 
the activation of  xxxg2335xxx  by capsaicin was potentiated by low ph
in this study. caterina et al. (1997) reported that capsaicininduced currents were ca. five-fold greater at ph 6.3 than at
ph 7.6 in a xenopus oocyte expression system. however, we
only observed a 1.6-fold increase in ca2 þ flux compared to
that at ph 7.5 (figure 4a).
the effect of ana, an endogenous cb1 and  xxxg2335xxx  agonist
(di marzo et al., 2001), was also strongly potentiated by low
ph in this study (figure 4a). olah et al. (2001) also reported
that acidification potentiates the activity of ana, whereas
others observed no potentiation (smart et al., 2000; for review
ralevic et al., 2002). the difference may be due to
methodological discrepancies. we also observed that another
endogenous cb1 and  xxxg2335xxx  agonist, nada (bisogno et al.,
2000), was even more strongly potentiated by acid ph than
ana (figure 4a).
in contrast to  xxxg2335xxx , the  xxxg2334xxx -mediated ca2 þ response to
 xxxd2565xxx  and icilin was inhibited by low ph (figure 4b). thus,
 xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx  are oppositely modulated by low ph. under
inflammatory conditions, when acidification of inflamed tissue
occurs, both mechanisms may play a role in the development
of hyperalgesia. the reduced ph could sensitize  xxxg2335xxx  and
thereby make the tissue more susceptible to pain stimuli, and
increasing heat sensations; the same acidic conditions would
inhibit  xxxg2334xxx , and reduce ‘pleasant cool’ sensations. thus,
 xxxg2335xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  may act in concert under inflammatory
conditions, and cause an aggravation of thermal hyperalgesia.

h.-j. behrendt et al

in conclusion, we have identified 10 novel  xxxg2334xxx  agonists.
the identification of three natural odorants that activate
 xxxg2334xxx , together with the fact that  xxxg2334xxx  is expressed in the
trigeminus, which belongs to the sensory system of the
olfactory epithelium, suggests that  xxxg2334xxx  could be an
important ‘chemosensory trigeminal nerve receptor’. agonistic  xxxg2334xxx  responses to () xxxd2565xxx  and icilin were
inhibited dose-dependently by three well-known  xxxg2335xxx  antagonists (capsazepine, thio-bctc and bctc). this suggests a
partial overlap between the ligand specificities of  xxxg2334xxx  and
 xxxg2335xxx , whereas the  xxxg2335xxx  response to endogenous agonists was

characterization of  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2335xxx 

strongly potentiated by low ph, the  xxxg2334xxx  response was
inhibited.
