in the steroidogenic pathways present in the gonads
and adrenal cortex, 30-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerase (30hsd) is a key enzyme which
controls the formation of a4-3-ketosteroids from a 5 3/9-hydroxysteroids. herein, we used an antibody
against human placental 3/9hsd and a rat testicular
3/9hsd cdna probe to study the expression of rat
liver 30hsd mrna and protein. rat liver microsomal
30hsd activity has been previously reported to exhibit a significant sex difference, with much higher
activity in the male. we have shown an age-dependent increase in levels of immunoreactive 30hsd
through the time of maturation of the male rat. the
immunoreactive protein, of similar molecular size to
the human placental and rat testicular 30hsd, was
localized to the microsomal fraction of liver and was
concentrated in pericentral locations. immunoreactive protein was not detected in liver of immature
(before 25 days of age) rats of either sex or in adult
female liver. northern blot analysis of liver and testicular rna with a rat testicular 30hsd cdna probe
revealed the presence of a 1.6-kilobase mrna species in addition to the major 2.1-kilobase mrna
species in adult male liver, neither of which was
detected in immature or adult female liver rna.
hypophysectomy of female rats or treatment with
testosterone implants caused induction of liver
30hsd protein, while continuous infusion of gh to
male rats decreased the level of 3/3hsd protein.
similarly, the levels of the mrna species were decreased after gh treatment. using [3a-3h]dehydroepiandrosterone as substrate for 3/3hsd activity, we
determined the apparent km for liver microsomal
nad+-dependent 3/3hsd activity to be 20 mm in both
adult male and female liver and was much greater
than the km of rat leydig tumor 3/3hsd activity (0.2

mm). liver 3/3hsd activity was inhibited by  xxxd3436xxx ,
a proven inhibitor of gonadal and adrenal 3/3hsd
activity. a rat liver 3/5hsd cdna was isolated from a
male liver cdna library that was closely related to
the type ii30hsd form of rat ovary but different from
type iii liver 30hsd. the enzyme obtained upon
expression of this cdna had properties characteristic of male-specific nad+-dependent liver microsomal 3/3hsd {i.e. high apparent km for dehydroepiandrosterone) and distinct from those of the high
affinity gonadal type 13/3hsd. we conclude that liver
30hsds are distinct members of the 30hsd family
of enzymes, and their male-specific expression is
modulated via the sex-specific pattern of gh secretion. (molecular endocrinology 5: 1090-1100, 1991)

introduction
3/3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/a5~*4-isomerase
(3/3hsd) catalyzes the formation of a4-3-ketosteroids
from a5-3/3-hydroxysteroids, viz. the synthesis of the
potent steroid hormones progesterone, 17a- xxxd2303xxx , and androstenedione from their much
less hormonally active precursors pregnenolone, 17ahydroxypregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone
(dhea), respectively. the enzyme catalyzes an obligate
step in the biosynthesis of not only mineralocorticoids
and glucocorticoids, but also androgens and estrogens.
it is expressed at high levels in classical steroidogenic
tissues, viz. placenta, ovary, adrenal cortex, and testis,
and also in tissue sites as diverse as liver (1), kidney
(2), and keratinocytes (3). recently, a form of the enzyme was purified from human placenta (4), polyclonal
antibodies were raised against this purified enzyme (5),
and subsequently, full-length human placental (6,7) and
rat testicular (8, 9) cdnas were isolated that encoded
a protein with both dehydrogenase and isomerase ac-

male-specific expression of liver 3/3hsd

tivities toward a variety of steroids in a heterologous
cell expression system (7-9). because 1) southern
analysis of both human and rat genomic dna is suggestive of distinct but related 3/8hsd genes (10), 2) it is
possible that distinct forms of the enzyme system exist
in different tissues, with each catalyzing specific steroid
dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions, and 3),
different regulatory mechanisms may affect their
expression, it is important to define the characteristics
of the enzyme and its mrna in other tissues. previous
reports have established that microsomal 3/3hsd activity of rat liver is present at high levels in male compared
to female liver (11), and that this activity is predicated
based on the state of androgenization of the liver. the
cloning and preliminary characterization of a rat liver
3/3hsd cdna that exhibits sexual dimorphic expression
have recently been reported (12). members of two other
families of rat liver microsomal steroid-metabolizing enzymes, namely certain cytochromes p450 and steroid
5a-reductase, also exhibit sexual dimorphic expression,
principally regulated at the pituitary level (reviews in
refs. 13 and 14). in this communication we demonstrate a male-specific liver 3/3hsd to be a distinct
member of the 3/3hsd family of enzymes, and its
expression altered by the sex-specific pattern of gh
secretion or factors that influence or are affected by
the gh secretory pattern. the sex-specific, developmental, and hormonal pattern of expression of liver
3/3hsd appears analagous to the regulation reported
for several male-specific hepatic cytochrome p450s.

results and discussion

using a polyclonal antibody raised against human placental 30hsd for western blot analysis of liver microsomal preparations of adult male rats, we observed an
immunoreactive species of similar molecular size
(-45,000) to the 3/3hsd of rat adrenal and human
placenta (fig. 1a). no immunoreactive species were
observed in liver microsomes from adult female or
immature rats of either sex (4 weeks old), even after
prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram. immunoblot
analysis (fig. 1b) of homogenates prepared from livers
of male rats at various stages of maturity indicated
onset of expression of the immunoreactive protein after
4 weeks of age, with increasing amounts of the protein
accumulating through the period to adulthood. pretreatment of male rats with various well known inducers of
liver microsomal enzymes (viz. phenobarbital, /?-napthoflavone, ciprofibrate, and ethanol) did not noticeably
influence the specific microsomal content of the immunoreactive species (fig. 1a). the immunoreactive protein was firmly associated with microsomal membranes,
and all cytosolic fractions were devoid of immunoreactive species (data not shown). we interpret these findings to indicate a male-specific induction of liver microsomal 3/3hsd associated with sex-linked maturation of
the male rat.

the age dependency (onset of puberty) of expression
of several male-specific cytochromes p450 of the iic
subfamily has been demonstrated (reviewed in ref. 14).
these differences between sexes in expression of the
microsomal cytochromes p450 appear to be due to an
increase in enzyme accumulation during pubertal development in the male rat or a decrease in enzyme
during female maturational processes (15-19). in the
case of the microsomal 3/flhsd, there was no detectable immunoreactivity in either the immature male or
female liver, but immunodetectable liver microsomal
3/3hsd protein accumulated through the period of maturation of the young male rat (fig. 1b). the protein was
clearly detectable at 30 days of age and attained an
adult level by 65 days of age. after northern blot

(9, 20), we observed an increased accumulation during
aging of a 2.1-kilobase (kb) hybridizable mrna species
of liver rna, suggesting that increased levels of enzyme protein were a result of increased mrna levels.
the major liver 3/3hsd mrna species appeared larger
than the 1.6-kb mrna species observed in rat testicular
rna (fig. 2) and rat adrenal (data not shown). a minor

fig. 2. ontogenesis of 3/3hsd mrna in rat liver and testis
total rna from the liver and testes of male rats at various
ages (22, 30, and 44 days old) was isolated, electrophoresed,
and northern blotted with a rat testicular 3j8hsd cdna probe
(nucleotides 377-1329) for autorads a and b, as described in
materials and methods. to each lane 30 ^g of rna were
added. the presence and integrity of the major rna species
were examined under uv light and were consistent and similar
in each lane. autorads a and b were obtained at two different
periods (1 and 3 days, respectively) of exposure. autorad c
represents a 2-day exposure of a separate blot containing
rna (30 /xg/lane) isolated from adult testis and adult male and
female liver that was resolved on an agarose gel (with a wider
comb than that in a and b to improve resolution) and probed
with a rat liver 3/3hsd cdna (nucleotides 1496-1777).

testicular mrna (i.e. 1.6 kb) was also discernable at
extended exposure times. interestingly, the level of
testicular 3/3hsd mrna decreased as the rat matured.
no hybridizable mrna species was detectable in the
rna from adult female rat liver (fig. 2). based on the
sex-specific expression and size of the message, it
seems likely the 2.1-kb species has much similarity to
the rat liver 3/3hsd type iii cdna previously reported
(12).
gonadectomy of male rats before puberty did not
appear to affect the appearance of the 3/3hsd liver
protein (fig. 3a), while the protein was still not observable in adult females that had been ovarectomized
when immature (26 days old). treatment of gonadectomized female rats with silastic implants that contained testosterone promoted induction of liver 3/3hsd
protein levels (fig. 3a). in another experimental protocol
using intact female rats, treatments were started at 33
days of age and continued for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25
days. after 10 days of treatment, immunodetectable
protein was present, and the level after 20 days of
treatment approximated that in the adult male liver (fig.
3b). this finding suggested that expression of liver
3/3hsd was androgen dependent. after western blot
analysis of livers from 53-day-old male rats castrated 4
weeks previously (i.e. at 26 days of age), however,
revealed levels of 3/3hsd protein similar to those in
intact rats, we concluded that expression of 3/3hsd in
the male may involve neonatal imprinting by androgen,
similar to that observed with certain other hepatic microsomal enzymes (15-17,19).
because hypophysectomy was known to cause the
expression of certain sex-specific cytochromes p450
(e.g. p450iic13), but not others (e.g. p450iic11), the
effect of hypophysectomy on levels of hepatic 3/3hsd
was evaluated. the results are illustrated in fig. 4. the
level of immunoreactive hepatic 3/3hsd in male rats 2
weeks after hypophysectomy was slightly elevated
compared to that in sham-operated animals (fig. 4a).
hypophysectomy of female rats induced expression of
liver 3/3hsd, which was immunodetectable 2 weeks
after hypophysectomy, with further increases occurring
at later times (fig. 4b). thus, the suppression of 3/3hsd
expression in the liver of intact female rats appeared
dependent, either directly or indirectly, on a hypothalamic-pituitary factor(s).
it has been proposed, based on a reasonable amount
of evidence, that androgen-related expression of several sex-specific hepatic microsomal enzymes is regulated by the pattern of gh secretion into circulating
blood of the rat (16,18,19). the basal levels of gh in
the female are sustained compared to those in the male
rat, in which gh secretion occurs in high amplitude
pulses at approximately 3-h intervals, with very low gh
levels occurring between these bursts (21). we found
that when gh was administered continuously to male
rats using an alzet minipump to mimic the female
pattern of blood gh, the levels of both 3j3hsd protein
and mrna were decreased dramatically (fig. 5, a and
b). the results of both hypophysectomy and gh infu-

fig. 3. immunoblot analysis of 3/8hsd content of liver from
testosterone-treated and gonadectomized rats
a, aliquots (100 ng protein) of microsomes prepared from
individual livers of testosterone-treated (gx+t) or control gonadectomized (gx) rats were subjected to sds-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed as described in materials and methods.
the origins of the various liver microsomes were 26-day-old
male (lane 1), 55-day-old intact male (lane 2), 55-day-old
gonadectomized (at 26 days) males (lanes 3 and 4), 55-dayold gonadectomized (at 26 days) males treated with testosterone implants for 29 days (lanes 5 and 6), 26-day-old female
(lane 7), 55-day-old female (lane 8), 55 day-old gonadectomized (at 26 days) females (lanes 9 and 10), and 55-day-old
gonadectomized (at 26 days) females treated with testosterone implants for 29 days (lanes 11 and 12). b, 3/3hsd immunoblot analysis of homogenates (100 ng protein/lane) of livers

(lanes 9 and 10), and 25 days (lanes 11 and 12). lanes 2 and
13 contain liver homogenates of untreated females 33 and 58
days old, respectively. lane 1 contains liver homogenate from
an adult male rat (58 days old).

sion studies are, thus, consistent with a marked ghdependent suppression of hepatic 3/3hsd expression
similar to that observed for several male-specific hepatic
cytochrome p450s, including p450iic13 (19), p450iia2
(22), and others.

by contrast, the female liver samples showed very
little immunoreactivity (fig. 6c), with only a slight color
above background and no particular pattern. this probably represents a nonspecific background reactivity in
the rabbit antiserum, because no specific reactivity was
observed in female liver microsomes by western blot
analysis. in some samples, very rare cells showed

fig. 7. effect of  xxxd3436xxx  on dhea 3/3hsd activity of adult
male rat liver microsomes
microsomes (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated with [3a-3h]dhea
(5 mm) and nad+ (1 mm), as described in materials and methods, in the presence or absence (control) of  xxxd3436xxx  (15 mm).
the data are expressed as the mean ± sd of triplicate determinations in two separate microsomal preparations (total of
six values); omission of error bars indicates that the sd is
confined within the symbol.

a typical progress curve of [3a-3h]dhea metabolism
and nad3h release in adult male liver microsomes, and
importantly, that this activity was inhibited by  xxxd3436xxx ,
a potent inhibitor of adrenal and gonadal 3/3hsd activity
(24). we also observed an age-dependent change in
the level of 3/3hsd activity in the liver of male rats using
this facile assay. this is presented in table 1, which
includes kinetic analysis data for 3/3hsd activities of
liver microsomes and rat leydig h540 tumor microsomes. the kinetic constants were derived from lineweaver-burk analyses of progress curves at different
dhea concentrations. the apparent km values for the
nad+-dependent activities of immature and adult male
liver microsomes are very similar (18 mm) and close to
that in the adult female liver. the maximum velocity
(vmax) values indicate an almost 5-fold higher level of
3/3hsd activity in adult male liver compared to that in
the immature liver and a 3-fold higher level of activity in
the adult male liver relative to that in the adult female
liver, while testosterone treatment of the female rat for
25 days caused a 3-fold increase in activity. the

nadp+-dependent activity of adult male liver microsomes had a similar affinity for dhea (19 hm), but the
adult female and immature male liver nadp+-dependent
activities had much lower affinities for dhea (>100 mm;
which made rate estimations a concern because of
problems of solubility), although there were fewer differences between sexes when nadp+-dependent specific activities (vmax) were estimated (data not shown).
the apparent km values obtained for the liver microsomal nad+-dependent activities were much greater than
the apparent km (0.2 ^m) for the rat leydig h540 tumor
3/3hsd activity determined using the same [3a-3h]
dhea assay procedure. the leydig tumor nadp+dependent activity was one tenth of the nad+-dependent activity (data not shown). the apparent km for the
3/3hsd activity expressed after transfection of monkey
kidney tumor cells with a rat testicular 3/3hsd cdna
was 0.1 nm (9). this difference in affinity for dhea (2
orders of magnitude) probably reflects a nonidentity
between the liver (high km) and gonadal (low km) enzyme and suggest that dhea is perhaps not the true
substrate of this liver enzymatic activity. furthermore,
there appear to be several different 3/3hsd activities
associated with rat liver microsomes, as suggested by
the studies of lax and co-workers (1), and these various
activities exhibit different levels of sex-linked expression. the lack of immunoreactivity of the detectable,
albeit low, 3/3hsd activities of immature and adult
female liver microsomes strongly suggests several distinct 3/3hsd isoforms.
characterization of a cdna encoding rat liver
3/3hsd
to date, three different types of rat 3/3hsd cdnas have
been described. type i is expressed in the gonads,
ovary (25), and testis (8, 9), type ii appears in the ovary
(25), while a third type of cdna has been described in
male liver (12). the presence of at least two species of
3/3hsd mrna in male rat liver, a major form of 2.1 kb
and a second form of 1.6 kb (see fig. 2c), again raised
the question of different isoforms of this enzyme being
expressed in rat liver.
a rat liver xgt10 cdna library was screened with a
radiolabeled probe corresponding to the kpn\-hind\\\
restriction fragment (nucleotides encoding residues
106-374) of a rat testicular 30hsd cdna (9). six clones

insert. by restriction mapping, four of these clones were
found to contain a second 1.3-kb restriction fragment
which hybridized with the 5'-ecori-ecori restriction
fragment of the rat testicular 3/3hsd (encoding residues

enzymes indicated that the clones contained two 1.3kb ecori fragments joined at a common ecori site.

and sequenced. the complete cdna consisted of a
2675-basepair (bp) insert with a 1182-bp 5'-untranslated region (the largest possible open reading frame
being 30 codons) and an open reading frame encoding
for a 373-amino acid protein (fig. 8). the clone consists
of two ecori fragments of 1320 and 1355 bp, respectively. analysis of the nucleotide coding domain sequence revealed a high homology (95%) with that of
the rat testis (8, 9) and type i ovarian 30hsd cdnas
(25), but an even higher homology with the type ii
ovarian 3/3hsd cdna (25). the initial 1002 nucleotides
of the cdna (in reverse orientation) had 96% homology
with part of the 12s ribosomal rna and trnaphe derived from rat mitochondrial dna (26, 27). presumably,
these multiple clones arose during construction of the
commercially obtained cdna library. at the deduced
amino acid sequence level, there are 24 differences
from the testicular and ovarian type i 3/3hsds (fig. 9b),
but only three differences from the deduced ovarian
type ii 3/3hsd (25). there are clearly many more differences between this rat liver 3/3hsd and the rat liver
type iii form recently described (12) than with the testicular and ovarian 3/3hsds. to follow the nomenclature
proposed (12), we have called the liver 3/3hsd cdna
described herein type ii.2. it is quite possible, however,
that this difference of only three codons results from
allelic variation (and/or sequencing errors), rather than
a new gene product. further investigation will be necessary to resolve this issue. the earlier finding by s1
nuclease protection assay that type ii 3/3hsd was not
expressed in rat liver (12) can be explained by the fact
that even one mismatch in the nucleotide sequence can
permit access for s1 cleavage and digestion, leading to
the absence of a protected fragment of the expected
size, and that the mrna corresponding to this type in
the liver is of possibly low abundance.
the introduction of the isolated cdna insert, deleted
of 1 kb 5' of the open reading frame, into the eukaryotic
expression vector pcmv5 permitted the study of some
of the characteristics of the protein encoded by this
cdna. the truncated cdna, ligated into pcmv5, was
expressed in simian virus-40 (sv-40)-transformed monkey kidney tumor (cos 1) cells. western blot analysis
of transfected cos cell protein revealed a protein that
was immunoreactive with rabbit polyclonal antihuman
placental 3/3hsd antiserum. the protein had the same
molecular size as the immunoreactive species present
in male rat liver or cos cells transfected with rat
testicular 3/jhsd cdna (fig. 9a). no immunoreactive
species was seen in mock-transfected cells or in cos
cells transfected with a construct containing the 5'-

homogenates of cos 1 cells transfected with either
the liver 3/3hsd cdna or the testicular 3/3hsd cdna
were assayed for 3/3hsd activity using the tritium re-

lease method used for liver microsomal assays. no
activity was detectable in mock-transfected cells. in the
presence of nad+ (1 him) as cofactor, the apparent km
for the dehydrogenation of [3a-3h]dhea was 14.0 ±
2.5 hm, with a vmax of 53 ± 4 pmol/minmg protein
(mean ± se for three separate sets) for cell homogenates transfected with the liver 3/3hsd cdna. on the
other hand, the apparent km and vmax in cells transfected with the testicular 3/3hsd cdna were 0.36 ±
0.05 fim and 820 ± 160 pmol/minmg protein (three
separate sets of cell homogenates), respectively. these
respective values of apparent km for the liver and testicular 3/?hsds correspond closely to those deduced
for the nad+-dependent 3/ihsd activities of male rat
liver microsomes and rat leydig h540 tumor microsomes (table 1). nadp+ did not support the idea of
3j8hsd activity of liver or testicular 3/3hsd in transfected cos cells.
this finding of a second 3/5hsd cdna in male rat
liver, closely related to the gonadal type ii, is indicative
of the presence of at least two 3j8hsd isoforms in rat
liver. the type ii liver isoform probably represents a
male-specific nad+-dependent 30hsd characterized
by a relatively low affinity (high km) for dhea compared
to the gonadal type i isoforms, possibly encoded on a
1.6-kb mrna species. this obtains because of the size
(1 kb) of the 5'-untranslated region, which appears
highly homologous to part of 12s ribosomal rna and
trnaphe derived from rat mitochondrial dna. various
complementary oligomers derived from the 5' untranslated region also did not hybridize to any liver mrna
species. the enzymatic characteristics of the type iii
isoform, encoded on a 2.1-kb mrna, have not been
described. interestingly, a nadp+-dependent male-specific 3/3hsd has been recently purified from rat liver
microsomes (28). it remains to be established whether
the type iii isoform might be a nadp+- or nad+-dependent, high km 3/3hsd. while the 30hsd immunoreactivity described herein corresponds most closely to
the nad+-dependent 3/3hsd activity, the basal activities observed in both adult female and immature male
liver would appear to be associated with another, much
less immunoreactive form of 30hsd. experiments designed to evaluate the ability of the antibody to inhibit
liver 3(8hsd activity were not definitive, an unsurprising
result given our earlier finding that this was not an
inhibitory antibody (5). further studies will be necessary
to better understand the roles of these different
3/3hsds in liver and gonads.
in conclusion, we have clearly demonstrated that the
expression of liver microsomal 3/3hsds, one form
clearly having a high km for dhea compared with the
primary gonadal isoform, appears to be dependent on
the pattern of gh secretion and that this male-specific
expression is directly due to increased levels of mrna
for 3j8hsd. these findings suggest that sexually differentiated liver 3j8hsd expression is controlled by complex hormonal factors mediated via the hypothalamicpituitary axis. either the absence of the female gh
pattern or, possibly, the presence of some other regu-

latory factor that is repressed by gh appears to be
involved in male-specific liver 3/3hsd expression. the
identity of the hormonal factor(s) that triggers induction
of hepatic 3/3hsd will be an important goal of future
investigations.

nitrocellulose membrane was washed in blocking buffer for 1
h and dried before exposure to photographic film. films from
different exposure periods were evaluated by densitometric
analysis to determine changes in the levels of immunoreactive
species. representative immunoblots are shown for each
experiment.
rna preparation and northern blot analysis

materials and methods
treatment of rats and preparation of rat liver
microsomes
tissues were obtained from adult fischer 344 rats (harlan
sprague-dawley, indianapolis, in) after co2 euthanasia. surgical modifications were performed by the supplier. silastic
tubing (no. 602-305, dow corning, midland, ml) implants that
contained testosterone were placed sc in female rats under
anesthesia to produce serum testosterone levels similar to
those in adult male rats (29). the size of implant (2.5 cm)
allowed male levels of testosterone to be maintained in the
blood for several weeks. gh was administered via a sc implanted 200-mi alzet osmotic minipump (model 2001, alza
corp., palo alto, ca) that delivered human gh (somatotropin,
sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo) at a rate of 3.5 /*g/h (1
^l/h) for 7 days. the intent was to produce a pattern of gh
administration in the male rats that mimicked more closely the
endogenous pattern of gh secretion in adult female rats (30).
sham-treated animals had minipumps that contained the vehicle (dulbecco's pbs-1% bsa, ph 7.4). the rat leydig h540
tumor (20, 31) was maintained by passage in male fischer
344 rats using a protocol approved by the institutional review
board for animal research at the university of texas southwestern medical center and in accordance with the nih guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals.
after euthanasia, livers were homogenized (20%, wt/vol) in
sucrose (0.25 m) and tris-chloride buffer (10 mm), ph 7.4. the
microsomal fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation,
as previously described (32). liver microsomal preparations
from adult male rats treated with phenobarbital, ciprofibrate,
pregnenolone-16a-carbonitrile, /3-naphthoflavone, or ethanol
(60%) were supplied by oxygene (dallas, tx).
protein immunoblotting
pieces of liver or transfected cos 1 cells were homogenized
in a small volume of lysing buffer containing 1 % sodium
 xxxd1835xxx , 0.1%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), and 0.8
mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in pbs. one-dimensional
electrophoresis was performed in an 8% polyacrylamide gel
containing 16.5% glycerol. sample buffer contained 0.05 m
tris (ph 6.8), 2% sds, 10% glycerol, and 8 mm edta, and
samples were loaded after boiling for 3 min in the presence of
2- xxxd26xxx . a mixture of protein standards (rainbow
markers, amersham, arlington heights, il) was used to determine the molecular size of migating proteins. electrophoresis
was carried out at 15-20 mamp at 4 c overnight.
proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose paper (33) in a
transphor electrophoresis unit (hoefer scientific instruments,
san francisco, ca) at 100 v for 1 h at 2-4 c in a buffer
containing 20% methanol, 20 mm tris, and 150 mm glycine.
the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 15 min at
room temperature in a blocking buffer containing 10 mm tris
(ph 7.4), 0.15 m naci, 0.2% nonidet p-40, and 0.5% dry milk
and then placed for 2 h in the same buffer containing polyclonal
antibodies (10 ng immunoglobulin g/ml) against human placental 3/3hsd. membranes were washed in the same buffer,
without antibody, for 15 min and incubated in the blocking
buffer containing approximately 106 cpm/ml [125l]protein-a
(icn biochemicals, irvine, ca) for 30 min. all incubations and
washings were performed at room temperature. finally, the

rna was isolated from tissues by the method of chomczynski
and sacchi (34). briefly, the tissues were dissolved in a solution
containing guanidium isothiocyanate (4 m), sodium citrate (25
mm), sodium sarcosyl (0.5%), and 2- xxxd26xxx  (0.1 m).
rna was extracted with a phenol-chloroform mixture, and
after two precipitations in the presence of isopropanol, rna
was solubilized in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and
stored at - 7 0 c until electrophoresis. total rna (20 jig) was
run in a 1.0% agarose gel in a buffer containing 0.1 m 3-(/vmorpholino)propanesulfonic acid (mops; ph 7.0), 40 mm sodium acetate, and 5 mm edta (ph 8.0) at 60 v for 5-6 h or
overnight at 20 v. the presence and integrity of the major
rna species of each lane were examined under uv light and
were consistent and similar in each lane. rna was transferred
to a zeta-probe membrane by capillarity using quick draw
paper (sigma) and 10 ssc (ssc 5 = 0.7 m naci plus 0.07 m
na citrate, ph 7.0) as buffer.
rna was fixed in the membrane by uv irradiation for 5 min.
prehybridization was performed in a sodium citrate buffer (ssc
5), ph 7.0, containing 50% formamide, 1 pe [5 pe = 250 mm
tris-hci (ph 7.5), 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium pyrophosphate, 5%
sds, 1 % polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1 %  xxxd3253xxx , 25 mm edta, and
1 % bsa] and 50 mg/ml purified yeast trna at 42 c. hybridizations were performed in the same buffer at 42 c for 16-24
h using a rat testis 3j8hsd cdna probe (9, 19), plbir3/9,
labeled with a multiprime dna labeling system (amersham).
the blots were washed two times in 2 ssc containing 0.1%
sds at room temperature for 15 min, one time in 0.1 ssc
containing 0.1% sds at room temperature for 30 min, and
finally, two times in 0.1 ssc plus 0.1% sds at 55 c for 30
min. after autoradiography, films from different exposure periods were evaluated by densitometric analysis to determine
changes in the levels of hybridized mrna species. the rna
species were sized on their relative mobility compared to the
major ribosomal rna 18s and 28s species and bacterial 16s
and 23s ribosomal rna standards (boehringer mannheim
biochemicals, indianapolis, in). representative blots are
shown for each experiment.

immunohistochemistry
pieces of adult male and female rat livers were fixed by
immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin. sections were stained for 3/?hsd reactivity using the
streptavidin-biotin method (histostain-sp kit for rabbit primary
antibody, zymed, san francisco, ca). after routine deparaffinization, sections were treated with normal blocking serum (10
min at room temperature), rabbit anti-hsd primary antibody
(30 min at 37 c), and biotinylated goat antirabbit immunoglobulin (10 min at room temperature). at this point, the slides
were exposed to 0.5% h2o2 in methanol for 5 min to block
endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase for 5 min, and the substrate aminoethylcarbazole plus h2o2 for 15 min. for photography, sections
were not counterstained, but for observations, sections were
lightly stained with hematoxylin before mounting with an
aqueous mounting medium (gva-mount). incubations were
carried out in a moist chamber, and slides were washed three
times in pbs between treatments. for control sections, primary antibody was replaced with 0.01 m pbs. sections were
observed on a zeiss photomicroscope ii (new york, ny), and
photographs were taken using a green filter and kodak plus
x film (eastman kodak, rochester, ny).

male-specific expression of liver 3£hsd

30hsd activity measurement
3j8hsd activity was determined by incubation of cos cell
homogenates, rat liver, or h540 leydig tumor microsomes
with various concentrations of [3a-3h]dehydroepiandrosterone
(0.1-50 jxm) for various periods at 37 c. the 3/3-dehydrogenation of [3a-3h]dhea results in the formation of nad3h from
nad+ and unlabeled androstenedione (23,35). the separation
of unmetabolized radiolabeled steroid substrate from 3h2o by
chloroform extraction allows the determination of radioactivity
contained in the aqueous phase. this measure is used for
quantification of 3/3hsd activity. incubation media were extracted with chci3 (three times; 5 ml) to remove unmetabolized
[3a-3h]dhea. aliquots (0.25 ml) of the remaining aqueous
layers were assayed for radioactivity. protein concentrations
were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (bcasigma) (36).  xxxd3436xxx  (4a,5-epoxy-17/3-hydroxy-3-keto-5aandrostane-2a-carbonitrile) was a gift from sterling winthrop,
inc. (rensselaer, ny).
library screening, isolation of cdna clones, and dna
sequence analysis
a male rat liver xgt10 cdna library (clontech laboratories,
inc., palo alto, ca) was screened with a 1.0-kb kpnl-h/ndlll
restriction fragment probe encoding amino acid residues 106374 of a rat testicular 30hsd (8, 9) which had been radiolabeled with [«-32p]dctp using a multiprime kit (amersham).
the longest insert (rla1.3) of 2.6 kb isolated from positive
clones contained two ecori restriction fragments of 1380 and
1355 bp (due to the presence of an internal ecori site in the
cdna). the two fragments, separately or as a single insert,
were ligated into ecori-cleaved plbi25 and transformed into
dh5a competent cells (bethesda research laboratories,
gaithersburg, md). plasmid dna was prepared by the alkalinelysis miniprep procedure (37), and constructs were further
analyzed by restriction mapping and dna sequence analysis.
double stranded dna was sequenced by dideoxy chain termination (38) using [«-3ss] xxxd1148xxx  (1100 mci/mol; dupont-new
england nuclear, boston, ma) and sequenase (u.s. biochemical corp., cleveland, oh) according to the instructions provided. synthesized dna sequence primers were used to progressively extend the identification of the dna sequence.

a 1131-bp ecori-h/ndlll from plbi-rla1-3, containing residues 47-374 and a small portion of the 3' untranslated region,
was purified from agarose by the freeze-squeeze method (39),
ligated into similarly cleaved pcmv5 (7), and transformed into
hb101 competent cells (bethesda research laboratories) to
give pcmv-rla1. recombinant plasmids were isolated for
restriction enzyme analysis by the alkaline-lysis miniprep procedure (37). the 203-bp ecori fragment of rat testicular
3/3hsd cdna containing the 5' untranslated region and the
amino-terminal coding sequence (residues 1-46) was also
purified from agarose, ligated into ecori-cleaved pcmv-rla1,
and transformed into hb101 competent cells. this fragment
of the rat testis 3/3hsd cdna was identical in sequence to the
rat liver 3/3hsd cdna isolated here (see sequence in fig. 9).
recombinant colonies were transferred to nylon membrane
(dupont-new england nuclear) and probed with the purified
203-bp ecori fragment radiolabeled with [«-32p]dctp using a
multiprime kit (amersham). plasmid dna prepared from positive colonies was cleaved with pst\ to identify those constructs
containing the 203-bp ecori fragment in the correct orientation. plasmids prepared for transfection were purified by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation
(40) on a beckman tl-100 ultracentrifuge (palo alto, ca).
cos 1 cells were grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's
medium plus 10% iron-supplemented calf bovine serum (hy-

clone, logan, ut) and transfected with 2.5 ng plasmid dna/
ml transfection medium in 60-mm dishes using deae-dextran,
as previosuly described (7). for the determination of kinetic
parameters of enzymatic activity 72 h after transfection, cos
1 cells were homogenized in 0.154 m kci solution using an
ultraturrax (janke & kunkel, staufen, germany) homogenizer.
samples (0.1 mg protein) of this homogenate were incubated
at 37 c with various concentrations of [3a-3h]dhea in 50 him
phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, in a total assay volume of 1 ml. the
enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of nadh or
nad+ (1 mu). assays were processed as described above.
