5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) inhibited the k +-induced [3 h]dopamine ([ 3h]da) release from slices of rat striatum.
 xxxd2647xxx  ( xxxd2647xxx ) attenuated the inhibitory effect of 5-ht in a
dose-dependent manner.  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists,  xxxd2419xxx  and  xxxd2637xxx , prevented the effect of 5-ht as well as
 xxxd2647xxx  did. the inhibitory effect of 5-ht was not mimicked by a  xxxg1108xxx  agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat), and was not prevented by a 5-htia and 5-htib mixed receptor antagonist,
propranolol.  xxxd2647xxx  was a potent inhibitor of the binding of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  to binding sites in the striatum over
the concentration range 10-6-10 -4 m. lesion of the medial forebrain bundle with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda)
significantly reduced the k+-induced [3h]da release from the striatum and release was no longer inhibited by 5-ht.
lesioning, however, did not change significantly the [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding in the striatum. these results suggest that
 xxxd2647xxx  suppresses the inhibitory effect of 5-ht on da release in the striatum via the inhibition of 5-ht binding at
the  xxxg1113xxx  on the nerve terminal of the da-ergic neuron and, further, that the proportion of the 5-ht2
receptor site which is located on the nerve terminal of the da-ergic neuron is small in the striatum.

1. introduction
 xxxd2647xxx  (3-(2-morpholinoethylamino)-4methyl-6-phenylpyridazine dihydrochloride) is a
new atypical antidepressant drug (bizi6re et al.,
1982; 1985; mikus et al., 1985; r a d m a y r et al.,
1986; bohacek et al., 1987) which has been proven
to be effective for the treatment of senile dementia
(passeri et al., 1985).
bizi6re et al. (1982; 1985) showed that
 xxxd2647xxx  has d o p a m i n o m i m e t i c properties. a

stimulating effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on dopaminergic
(da-ergic) transmission was suggested by the results of pharmacological studies of  xxxd2647xxx -induced behavioural changes (bizi~re et al., 1984).
biochemical studies have shown that  xxxd2647xxx 
does not change the concentration of d a but
significantly alters the concentrations of the main
metabolites of d a in the striatum in rats (ferretti
et al., 1984).  xxxd2647xxx  caused an increase in
3-methoxytyramine (3-mt) and a decrease in homovanillic acid (hva) and dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid ( d o p a c ) concentrations.
h v a and d o p a c concentrations are mainly
an index of intraneuronal metabolism. 3 - m t has
been proposed as being a better indicator of d a
release (carlsson and lindqvist, 1963; kehr, 1976;
di giulio et al., 1978; w o o d et al., 1987).

da release in the striatum is modulated by
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) (ennis et al., 1981).
nicolaou et al. (1979) have shown that lesions of
the medial raphe nucleus produce an increase in
striatal da turnover in rats.
in the present study, we investigated the involvement of  xxxd2647xxx  in the modulation of d a
release in rat striatum.

2. materials and methods

male wistar strain rats, weighing 180-250 g,
were used. the rats were decapitated and the
striatum was divided according to the method of
glowinski and iversen (1966).

5-ht receptor agonists and antagonists were
added to the buffer  xxxd1891xxx  and 12 min, respectively,
before the second high k + stimulation.  xxxd2647xxx 
was added according to the same schedule as the
5-ht antagonists. the effect of the drug was
calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of
tritium released by the first and second stimulations ($2/s 1).
among the 5-ht receptor agonists and antagonists, only  xxxd2419xxx  increased spontaneous tritium release dose dependently at doses of more
t h a  xxxd1338xxx  - 7 m. this made it difficult to study the
effect of  xxxd2419xxx  on the 5-ht-induced inhibition of [3h]dopamine release by 25 m m k +. one
dose of  xxxd2419xxx , 10 - 6 m , at which interference
was minimal, allowed the evaluation of the effect
of  xxxd2419xxx  on release.

2.1. surgery
2.3. [3h]da uptake
the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 m g / k g i.p.) and palced in a stereotaxic apparatus. lesions of the medial forebrain
bundle (a, 5.0; l, 1.5; v, 2.5; ki3nig and klippel,
1963) were produced by applying 6 - o h d a 8/~g/4
/xl bilaterally 25 min after the administration of
desipramine (25 m g / k g i.p.).
experiments relating to [3h]da release and
receptor binding were carried out 1 week after the
lesioning.

2.2. [3h]da release experiments
slices of about 25 mg of the striatum were
incubated with [3h]da (0.1 /~m) for 20 min at
3 7 ° c in krebs-ringer tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.4)
gassed with 95% 02 and 5% co 2 and containing
2 × 10 - 4 m  xxxd228xxx  and 10 6 m  xxxd2850xxx .
after rinsing for 2 min in krebs-ringer tris-hc1
buffer (ph 7.4) gassed with 95% 02 and 5% co 2
the tissue was placed in a 0.5 ml chamber for
superfusion. superfusion with the buffer containing 5 × 10 - 7 m clorimipramine, was carried out at
the rate of 1 ml per min and a fraction was
collected every 2 min. the tissue was stimulated
with 25 m m kc1 for 6 min at 60 and 100 min
after the beginning of the superfusion by the
addition of 25 m m kc1 to the superfusion
medium.

the radioactivity released from 60 to 130 min
after the beginning of superfusion, and the radioactivity remaining in the tissue solubilized with
tissue solubilizer (ncs ®, amersham), was expressed as the uptake of [3h]da per 100 mg of
striatal tissue.

2.4. receptor binding experiments
membranes were prepared for binding assay
according to a method described by peroutka and
snyder (1979). the striatal tissue was homogenized with 50 m m tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.4), and
centrifuged for 10 min at 50 000 × g. the resultant
pellet was re-homogenized with 50 m m tris-hc1
buffer (ph 7.4) and was washed by centrifugation
at 5 0 0 0 0 × g for 10 min. this procedure was
repeated twice. the pellet thus obtained was homogenized with 50 volumes of 50 m m tris-hc1
buffer (ph 7.4) and was used as a m e m b r a n e
preparation. this preparation was incubated with
[3h]5-ht, [3h]8-oh-dpat or [3h] xxxd2419xxx  in
the buffer. in the case of [3h]5-ht binding, 0.1%
 xxxd228xxx  and 10 ~tm  xxxd2850xxx  were added to
the buffer. the reaction was carried out by incubation of the tritiated ligand and the preparation in 500/tl of 50 m m tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.4)
at 3 7 ° c for 10 min. 5-ht, 10/zm containing 0.1%

 xxxd228xxx ) was used to determine the nonspecific binding of [3h]5-ht and [3h]8-ohdpat.  xxxd2621xxx , 10 #m, was used to determine the non-specific binding in the case of
[ 3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding.
m e m b r a n e - b o u n d tritium ligand in the incubation mixture was trapped at the end of the incubation by rapid vacuum filtration through a whatm a n glass filter ( g f / b ) using the harvester for
receptor binding assay (blandel, usa). the filters
were rinsed 3 times with 3 ml of 50 m m tris-hc1
buffer (ph 7.4). the specific binding of the ligands
was obtained by subtracting the non-specific binding from each experimental value.
radioactivity was measured in a packard model
3255 liquid scintillation counting spectrometer.
protein concentration was determined by the
method of lowry et al. (1951) with bovine serum
albumin as the standard. binding experiments were
carried out in duplicate or triplicate.
d a t a were obtained from at least three separate
experiments. the values are presented as means _+
s.e.m., except those for the scatchard plot. statistical analysis was carried out with the analysis of
variance or t u c k e y ' s multiple c o m p a r i s o n s
(weiner, 1971).

3. r e s u l t s

3.1. attenuation by  xxxd2647xxx  of the 5-ht-induced
decrease of [3h]da release from striatal slices
rat striatal slices were incubated with [3h]da,
perfused with krebs-ringer tris-hc1 buffer (ph
7.4) containing chlorimipramine and were stimulated by perfusion with 25 m m k + buffer. kc1 25
m m increased the tritium release (fig. 1). 5 - h t
inhibited the 25 m m k+-induced release dose
dependently (fig. 2a). release was inhibited almost 50% by the addition of 10 -6 m 5-ht. the
inhibitory effect of 5-ht was also observed in the
presence of tetrodotoxin 0.1/~m (data not shown).
 xxxd2647xxx  attenuated the decrease in da release
after 5-ht (fig. 2b,c).  xxxd2647xxx  alone had a
slight inhibitory effect on tritium release from the
slices but it was not significant.

no effect on [3h]5-ht, [3h]8-oh-dpat or
[3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding in the brain (table 3).

4. d i s c u s s i o n

we now observed that 5-ht inhibited 25 m m
k+-stimulated [3h]da release from the striatum,
and that the inhibitory effect of 5-ht was attenuated by  xxxd2647xxx , as well as by 5-ht 2 receptor antagonists. the corpus striatum receives 5-ht
afferents from the dorsal raphe nuclei as well as
from nigrostriatal da-ergic neurons (azmitia,
1978). specific lesioning of the 5-ht neurons in
the medial raphe nucleus increased the striatal da
turnover rate (nicolau et al., 1979). an inhibitory
effect of 5-ht on da release in the striatum has
also been reported (ennis et al., 1981). these
authors found that the effect of 5-ht was
a n t a g o n i z e d b y m e t h y s e r g i d e , metergoline,
cinanserin,  xxxd1785xxx  and  xxxd2637xxx  and
could therefore have been mediated by 5-ht 2
receptors. they suggested that the 5-ht receptor
which mediated the inhibitory effect was located
on the nerve terminal of da-ergic neurons in the
striatum since the effect was unchanged by the
presence of tetrodotoxin.
although  xxxd2647xxx  has no effect on the da
content in the striatum, it increases the 3-mt
content and decreases the d o p a c and hva content (ferretti et al., 1984). the d o p a c and hva
concentrations represent mainly the intraneuronal
metabolism, while 3-mt has been considered to
be a better indicator of da release into the synaptic cleft (carlsson and lindqvist, 1963; kehr,
1976; di giulio et al,, 1978; wood et al., 1987).
thus, the increase in the 3-mt content brought
about by  xxxd2647xxx  might indicate an increase of
da release from the da neuron in the striatum.

 xxxd2647xxx  is not a da receptor stimulant but a
behavioural pharmacological study showed that
 xxxd2647xxx  at low doses induced stereotyped behavior, as do da receptor stimulants, and the
effects were blocked by da antagonist, haloperidol (bizi~re et al., 1985). furthermore, unilateral
microinjection of  xxxd2647xxx  into the striatum induced contralateral circulating behavior as also
seen with apomorphine (bizi6re et al., 1984). we
also observed the inhibition of [3h]da release by
5-ht in the presence of tetrodotoxin in the present study. this might mean that the effect of
5-ht was not mediated by an interneuron but was
exerted directly, by an action on the dopaminergic
nerve endings as previously reported (gillet et al.,
1985).  xxxd2647xxx  attenuated the inhibitory effect
of 5-ht and inhibited [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding quite
strongly in the striatum, as compared with [3h]5h t and [3h]8-oh-dpat binding.  xxxd2647xxx ,
however, inhibited [3h] xxxd2419xxx  binding noncompetitively. this means that, in contrast to
 xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd2419xxx   xxxd2647xxx  is a non-competitive antagonist of the 5-ht 2 receptor. the
active site of  xxxd2647xxx  might be different from
the 5-ht 2 receptor itself and might interact with
the 5-ht 2 receptor via the binding site of
 xxxd2647xxx . also, the inhibitory effect of 5-ht was
lost when the da neuron in the striatum was
denervated by injection of 6 - o h d a to the medial
forebrain bundle.  xxxd2647xxx  also prevented the
inhibitory effect of 5-ht on [3h]ach release in
the hippocampus as well as 5-ht 2 receptor
antagonists did (muramatsu et al., 1988).
these results suggest that  xxxd2647xxx  attenuates
the inhibitory effect of 5-ht by acting directly on
the 5-ht 2 receptor in the nerve terminal of the
da neuron in the striatum. though the number of
binding sites of [3h] xxxd2419xxx  was not observed
to decrease as a result of denervation, this could
have been due to the low ratio of the 5-ht 2
receptor which is located on the nerve terminal of
the da neuron to the total amount of 5-ht 2
receptors in the striatum. these data suggest that
 xxxd2647xxx  stimulates central da-ergic transmission, at least in the striatum.
in vivo studies with  xxxd2647xxx  have shown the
da mimetic properties of  xxxd2647xxx  (bizi6re et
al., 1982; 1984). these results, together with the

95
present data suggest that the facilitation of daergic t r a n s m i s s i o n by m i n a p r i n e could be d u e to
blockade of the inhibitory effect of 5-ht on da
r e l e a s e at t h e 5 - h t 2 r e c e p t o r o f t h e n e r v e t e r m i n a l
o f d a n e u r o n s in the striatum.
