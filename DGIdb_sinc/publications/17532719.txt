abstract

background: we investigated the potential interactions between esomeprazole
and a non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid; naproxen) or a
cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2-selective nsaid (rofecoxib) in healthy subjects.
methods: two studies of identical randomised, open, three-way crossover design
were conducted. subjects (n = 32 for both studies) were to receive 1 week’s
treatment with esomeprazole 40mg once daily (studies a and b), naproxen 250mg
twice daily (study a), rofecoxib 12.5mg once daily (study b), and esomeprazole
in combination with naproxen (study a) or rofecoxib (study b). study periods
were separated by a 2-week washout period.
results: on day 7 of dosing, the ratios (and 95% cis) for the area under the
plasma concentration-time curve during the dosing interval (auctau) and observed
maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of esomeprazole and nsaid combination/nsaid alone were 0.98 (0.94, 1.01) and 1.00 (0.97, 1.04), respectively, for
study a, and 1.15 (1.06, 1.24) and 1.14 (1.02, 1.28), respectively, for study b. the
ratios (and 95% cis) for auctau and cmax of esomeprazole and nsaid combination/esomeprazole alone were 0.96 (0.89, 1.03) and 0.92 (0.85, 1.00), respectively, for study a, and 1.05 (0.96, 1.15) and 1.05 (0.94, 1.18), respectively, for study
b. all treatments were well tolerated during the study period.
conclusion: naproxen and rofecoxib do not interact with esomeprazole, and
esomeprazole does not affect the pharmacokinetics of naproxen or rofecoxib.
these findings indicate that esomeprazole can be used in combination with
nsaids without the risk of a pharmacokinetic interaction.

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
are widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis (ra), osteoarthritis (oa) and a wide variety
of other acute and chronic painful musculoskeletal
disorders, and can, in most countries, be used as
standard analgesics and bought without a prescription. there were over 111 million nsaid prescriptions in the us for the year ending august 2000,
with one-third of the total number of prescriptions
being for cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2-selective
nsaids.[1] the use of nsaids is expected to increase further in the future, especially if they become more widely used for the prevention of
colorectal cancer and alzheimer’s disease. the use
of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection is
also expected to increase.
all nsaids are, however, associated with a substantial number of adverse events, with non-selective nsaids accounting for 20% and 25% of all
reported adverse drug events in the uk and us,
respectively.[2,3] nsaid-associated upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract adverse effects range from dyspeptic symptoms to peptic ulceration and ulcer complications.[4] some 15–40% of nsaid users report
upper gi symptoms[5] and 10–30% of long-term
nsaid users will develop a peptic ulcer, predominantly in the stomach.[6,7] nsaid use increases the
risk of peptic ulcer complications by 3- to 5-fold,
and 15–35% of all peptic ulcer complications are
reported to be caused by nsaid use.[4]
it has been estimated that there are over
100 000 hospital admissions per year and
16 500 deaths per year due to nsaid-induced gi
complications in the us.[8]
the anti-inflammatory properties of nsaids are
mediated through the inhibition of the  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme, whereas gi adverse effects occur as a result
of their action on cox-1.  xxxg1884xxx -selective
nsaids, such as celecoxib and rofecoxib, preferentially inhibit  xxxg1884xxx . one conclusion of the vigor

pared naproxen with rofecoxib in patients with ra,
was that treatment with rofecoxib was associated
with significantly fewer upper gi events than treatment with naproxen.[9] celecoxib was compared
with ibuprofen and diclofenac in a similar study.
the annual rates of upper gi complications were
lower for celecoxib compared with ibuprofen and
diclofenac, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, and the combination of celecoxib
and low-dose (≤325 mg/day) aspirin negated the gi
advantage of celecoxib.[10] it is also worth noting
that in this trial, the doses of celecoxib used were
2–4 times the maximum recommended doses for the
treatment of ra and oa.
unfavourable cardiovascular risk data has led
to an urgent re-evaluation of the use of the
 xxxg1884xxx -selective class of nsaids in clinical practice, culminating in the market suspension of the
 xxxg1884xxx -selective agents rofecoxib and  xxxd3481xxx .[11,12] the us fda has requested that manufacturers of all marketed prescription nsaids revise
product labeling to include a boxed warning highlighting the potential for increased risk of cardiovascular events, and is encouraging physicians to limit
the use of  xxxg1884xxx -selective agents to the lowest
practical dose for the most urgent cases.[13] all
 xxxg1884xxx -selective agents available in europe contain
cardiovascular warnings, and prescribers are advised to carefully regard the warnings in patients
with a history of cardiovascular disease.[14] celecoxib is still available in the us, and celecoxib and
various other  xxxg1884xxx -selective agents are still available in europe.[13,14] additionally, during the first
quarter of 2005, an fda advisory panel recommended that rofecoxib should again be made available to patients, and that black-box warnings be
placed on the labels of all  xxxg1884xxx -selective
agents.[15,16] canadian health authorities may also be
moving towards approving the return of rofecoxib to
the market.[17] consequently, it does seem likely
that, in the future, a range of  xxxg1884xxx -selective
clin drug invest 2005; 25 (11)

no pharmacokinetic interaction between esomeprazole and naproxen/rofecoxib

agents may still have a role to play in the effective
management of certain patients with low cardiovascular risk.
the  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor (ppi) omeprazole has
been shown to be superior to ranitidine and misoprostol for both the healing and the prevention of
nsaid-associated ulcers and dyspeptic symptoms
during continued nsaid treatment.[18,19] the degree
of gastric damage caused by nsaids is highly
dependent on intragastric ph.[18,20] esomeprazole,
which confers a longer time with intragastric ph >4
than all other ppis,[21] is expected to be effective for
the prevention of nsaid-associated ulcers.
as esomeprazole is expected to be widely used in
the healing and prevention of gastric and duodenal
ulcers, and to control upper gi symptoms in patients
needing continuous nsaid treatment to relieve inflammation and pain, it is important to rule out any
drug-drug interactions between esomeprazole and
nsaids, including non-selective and selective
agents. in order to test for pharmacokinetic interactions between esomeprazole and naproxen, a popular non-selective nsaid, and between esomeprazole and rofecoxib, a previously popular
 xxxg1884xxx -selective nsaid that may still be a beneficial drug in carefully selected patients, we conducted two identically designed studies in healthy subjects.
materials and methods
subjects

healthy subjects were included if they: were
20–50 years old; had a body mass index of
19–27 kg/m2; weighed 50–95kg; showed normal
physical findings and laboratory values; had not
used esomeprazole for the previous 8 weeks, any
prescribed medication for the previous 2 weeks, or
over-the-counter drugs (including herbal remedies,
vitamins and minerals) in the week preceding the
first dose of study drug; were not using anabolic

steroids; were not of childbearing potential or lactating; had no history of cardiac, renal, hepatic, neurological or significant gastrointestinal diseases; had
not donated blood in the 12 weeks prior to the first
dose of study drug or during the study; did not
smoke or consume any other sort of nicotine (or
equivalent); and were not using concomitant medications (except nasal spray for nasal congestion, or
paracetamol).
the studies (study codes: sh-nen-0016 and shnen-0017) were conducted in accordance with the
declaration of helsinki and were approved by the
ethics committee of the university of uppsala and
by the swedish medical products agency. written
informed consent was received from all subjects
prior to participation. the studies were performed at
quintiles ab, uppsala, sweden.
all subjects underwent a full clinical examination, physical examination and electrocardiogram
(ecg) at pre-entry. a laboratory screen for
haematology and serum biochemistry was performed prior to enrolment, on day 7 of each treatment period, and 5–7 days after the last study day.
study design

the two studies were conducted according to a
randomised, open, three-way crossover design. each
of the three treatment periods lasted for 7 days,
which was sufficient to achieve steady state. the
subjects received either oral doses of an esomeprazole 40mg capsule once daily (studies a and
b), a naproxen 250mg tablet twice daily (study a), a
rofecoxib 12.5mg tablet once daily (study b), or
esomeprazole in combination with naproxen (study
a) or rofecoxib (study b). each treatment period
was separated by a washout period of at least
14 days. blood samples for determination of esomeprazole, naproxen and rofecoxib were taken for
24 hours post-dose on the last day of each treatment
period. alcohol was not allowed from 2 days before
pre-entry, during each treatment period, and beclin drug invest 2005; 25 (11)

drugs available on prescription were not allowed
during the last 2 weeks preceding the studies and
during the studies.
on the investigational days, the subjects arrived
at the study centre in the morning, having fasted
since the previous evening, for administration of the
study drug and collection of repeated blood samples.
on these days, standardised meals were served
4 (lunch), 6 (light meal), 10 (dinner) and 13 (light
meal) hours after drug administration.
study drugs

in study a, the subjects received an esomeprazole 40mg capsule (nexium®, astrazeneca
tablet production, sweden)1 once daily, a naproxen
250mg tablet (naprosyn®, roche, switzerland)
twice daily, or a combination of the two drugs orally
for 7 days. in study b, the subjects received an
esomeprazole capsule (nexium®) once daily, a
rofecoxib 12.5mg tablet (vioxx®, msd, germany)
once daily, or a combination of the two drugs orally
for 7 days.
blood sampling and bioanalytical methods

blood samples for assay of esomeprazole,
naproxen and rofecoxib were taken at pre-dose and
at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3,
3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 and 24 hours
following drug administration on day 7. the blood
samples were drawn from an indwelling cannula in a
forearm vein and collected in heparinised tubes,
centrifuged and the plasma transferred, frozen and
stored until analysis.
the plasma concentration of esomeprazole was
analysed using normal phase liquid chromatography
with ultraviolet detection.[22] the limit of quantification (loq) for this method is 25 nmol/l with a
coefficient of variation (cv) of <20%. the plasma
1

concentration of naproxen was determined using
liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection.
the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min and the injection
volume was 20–40mul. the retention time was
3.0 minutes and absolute recovery in the concentration range of 0.5–500 mumol/l was between 89% and
100%. the loq was 0.5 mumol/l (cv ≤20%). intraand interassay repeatability were 4–5% and 4–6%,
respectively. rofecoxib plasma concentration was
also determined using liquid chromatography and
fluorescence detection. the flow rate was 1.2 ml/
min and the injection volume was 150mul. the retention time was 4.5 minutes and the absolute recovery
in the concentration range of 3.0–200 nmol/l was
between 90% and 91%. the loq was 1.5 nmol/l
(cv ≤20%). both intra- and interassay repeatability
were 6–7%. the plasma samples were analysed for
esomeprazole, naproxen and rofecoxib at quintiles ab, uppsala, sweden.
pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses

pharmacokinetic parameters of esomeprazole,
naproxen and rofecoxib were estimated by noncompartmental analysis using winnonlin computer
software. the area under the plasma concentration
versus time curve during the dosing interval (auctau)
was calculated according to a log-linear trapezoidal
method. for naproxen, the auctau was calculated up
to 12 hours post-dose, while for esomeprazole and
rofecoxib the auctau was calculated up to 24 hours
post-dose. the elimination rate constant (lambda) was
determined by log-linear regression analysis of the
terminal slope of at least the last three plasma concentration versus time points. the terminal plasma
elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as ln2/lambda.
the observed maximum plasma concentration
(cmax) and the time to reach cmax (tmax) were also
recorded.

no pharmacokinetic interaction between esomeprazole and naproxen/rofecoxib

the pharmacokinetic parameters were analysed
using a mixed-model analysis of variance
(anova) with fixed effects for sequence, period
and treatment (the drug alone or in combination) and
a random effect for subjects within sequences. the
pharmacokinetic parameters were log-transformed
prior to the analysis. estimates and 95% confidence
limits of the log-transformed parameters were antilogarithmised, and the results are presented as geometric means and ratios with 95% confidence intervals (cis). the median was presented for tmax.
results
thirty-two healthy subjects (13 males and 19 females) with a mean age of 24 years and a mean
bodyweight of 69kg participated in the esomeprazole and naproxen study (study a). thirty-one
subjects completed the treatment comparison of esomeprazole alone and in combination with naproxen, while 30 subjects completed the treatment comparison of naproxen alone and in combination with
esomeprazole.
thirty-two healthy subjects (15 males and 17 females) with a mean age of 26 years and a mean
weight of 69kg participated in the esomeprazole and

both esomeprazole and naproxen were rapidly
absorbed, and the median tmax was approximately
1.5 hours for both drugs, both during monotherapy
and during combination therapy (table i and
figures 1 and 2). no changes were observed in
auctau, cmax and t1/2 for esomeprazole after co-administration with naproxen compared with esomeprazole monotherapy (see table ii). the ratios

discussion
esomeprazole is expected to be widely used in
the management of upper gi symptoms, and to heal
and prevent gastric and duodenal ulcers associated
with continued nsaid use. therefore, esomeprazole will commonly be used in combination
with nsaids. although it seems likely that in most

these agents. the aim of the present study was to
rule out any potential for drug-drug interaction between esomeprazole and naproxen, being a representative non-selective nsaid, and rofecoxib, as an
example of a  xxxg1884xxx -selective nsaid.
esomeprazole plasma levels were not affected by
naproxen or rofecoxib. the auctau, cmax and t1/2 for
esomeprazole after co-administration with naproxen
or rofecoxib were similar to those after esomeprazole alone. the auctau, cmax and t1/2 of naproxen after co-administration with esomeprazole were
similar to those after naproxen alone. there was a
marginal increase in auctau and cmax for rofecoxib
during the combination therapy compared with
rofecoxib administered alone. the slight
pharmacokinetic changes seen would not be expected to have any clinical relevance. rofecoxib has
double plasma concentration-time profiles when administered alone[23] and in combination with esomeprazole (figure 4). this may be due to redistriclin drug invest 2005; 25 (11)

bution or to an enterohepatic circulation phenomenon. we do not know the reason(s) for the double
profile for rofecoxib; however, this is a normal
concentration-time profile for rofecoxib.[23]
pharmacokinetics is one of the factors that may
influence the nsaid safety profile. although the
majority of marketed nsaids are well absorbed,
metabolised extensively, subject to fairly minimal
first-pass extraction, and have linear pharmacokinetics, some more subtle differences are apparent.[24]
esomeprazole metabolism is mediated by cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoforms, cyp2c19 and
cyp3a4,[25] while the nsaids have been shown to
be mainly metabolised by another cyp isoform,
cyp2c9.[26] on the basis of this knowledge, a drug
interaction would not be expected between esomeprazole and the nsaids. however, a recently
published study has reported that the extent of the
role of cyp2c9 in the overall clearance of different
nsaids is varied, and that cyp3a4 activity can
sometimes be involved.[24] we feel that a lack of
drug interactions during combination therapy with
esomeprazole and all available nsaids should not
be assumed, but rather evaluated on an individual
basis. the results of the present interaction study
help to confirm that drug-drug interactions are not
an issue between esomeprazole and naproxen or
rofecoxib. this study is also in agreement with
previous studies involving omeprazole, which
showed no drug-drug interactions between
omeprazole and three different nsaids (naproxen,
diclofenac or  xxxd2969xxx ).[27]
conclusion
neither naproxen nor rofecoxib have any effect
on the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole, and esomeprazole does not have any effect on the
pharmacokinetics of naproxen or rofecoxib. the
clinical implications of these findings are that esomeprazole can be used together with naproxen or
rofecoxib without pharmacokinetic drug interaction

safety concerns for the healing and prevention of
gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients needing continuous nsaid treatment to relieve inflammation
and pain. repeated oral administration of esomeprazole alone, as well as in combination with
naproxen or rofecoxib, was well tolerated.
