summary: the biological effects of dose-dependent inhi-
bition of renin have rarely been extensively studied after
oral (p.o.) dosing in humans. we studied  xxxd3095xxx 
(ro42-4892), a selective renin inhibitor, in normal volun-
teers after activation of the renin-angiotensin system
(ras) based on salt depletion. twelve normal men (28 +
9 years, 77 + 10 kg), comprising three consecutive dose
panels of 4 subjects, received four treatments, double-
blind and randomised 2 weeks apart: panel i, placebo (p),
or 30, 100, and 300 mg,  xxxd3095xxx : panel i. placebo or
300, 600 mg, 1.000; panel ti], placebo or 30, 600, and
1.000 mg. the ras was activated by 40 mmol/day sodium
diet plus  xxxd2167xxx  (40 mg bds), for 3 days before each
study day. data (mean + sd) were examined by re-
peated-measures analysis of variance (anova). ras
activation was confirmed by 24-h urinary sodium excre-
tion (screen, 142 + 74 mmol/24 h; prestudy. 66 + 33,59 +
41, 78 + 4. 73 + 30 mmol/24 h) and increase in plasma
renin activity (pra) (screen, 0.8 + 0.3 ng al/ml/h: before
dosing, p, 6.5 + 3.1: 30 mg, 8.2 + 3: 100 mg. 9.4 + 5.7;
300 mg. 6.5 + 2.4: 600 mg. 5.2 + 2: 1,000 mg. 6.2 + 4.4 ng
al/ml/h). pra was reduced in dose dependently (mean
minimal activity: 30 mg 1.4 + 1.2; 100 mg. 1.6 + 1: 300
mg. 0.1 + 0.1, 600 mg, 0.1 + 0.1: 1,000 mg, 0.01 + 0.02),
and active renin was increased (mean maximal active re-
nin; 30 mg, 182 + 186: 100 mg. 185 + 83: 300 mg, 252 +
240; 600 mg, 262 + 100, 1.000 mg, 1.417 + 2.008 pg/ml).
maximal effects were noted soon after dosing for pra (30
mg. 1.1 + 0.3: 100 mg. 1 + 0: 300 mg, 1 + 0: 600 mg, 1.3
+ 0.4: 1.000 mg. 1.3 + 0.4 h) but slower for increase in

 

nonselective blockade of the renin—angiotensin
system (ras) with  xxxg36xxx 
inhibitors (acei) has been one of the major thera-
peutic advances in treatment of hypertension and
heart failure in the last two decades. their tndica-
tions and efficacy continue to expand (1). clinically

1.8 + 1.6: 600 mg, 2.8 + 1.5: 1,000 mg, 3.4 + 1.4 h).
despite evidence of biochemical effect, supine blood
pressure (bp) was not significantly affected by active
treatment. erect bp did show a significant decrease from
pretreatment values, but only after 1,000 mg  xxxd3095xxx  |
h after dosing (p, baseline, 116 + 12/68 + 7: lh, 112 +
8/65 + 7: 1,000 mg, baseline, 114 + 12/65 + 7: 1h, 96 +
9/s0 + 18). drug concentrations showed a wide dose-
related spectrum of mean maximal concentrations (30 mg,
1.07 + 1.64; 100 mg, 2.17 + 1.38; 300 mg, 28.88 + 16.98,
600 mg. 67.76 + 36.06: 1.000 mg, 136.9 + 156 ng/ml.
values for 7,,,, were generally observed soon after dos-
ing and were not clearly dose related (30 mg. 0.5 + 0.8:
100 mg, 0.56 + 0.77; 300 mg, 0.66 + 0.51; 600 mg, 0.44 +
0.11. 1,000 mg. 0.94 + 0.63 h).  xxxd3095xxx  is enzymati-
cally active after p.o. administration in humans in a dose-
dependent manner. only the dose of 1,000 mg reduced bp
in salt-deplete subjects. haemodynamic effects are there-
fore demonstrable but are slight. dissociated from ras
inhibition in blood, despite confirmed activation of the
ras. bp changes paralle! the pharmacokinetic profile.
the latter ts unlikely to permit once daily dosing with 24-h
effect. higher doses and or controlled-release p.o. formu-
lations or alternative routes of administration would be
required to achieve antihypertensive efficacy. owing to
the selective nature of renin inhibition, a separate profile
of efficacy and response in hypertensive patients is un-
likely. key words:  xxxd3095xxx —oral treatment—blood
pressure—hormone inhibition—pharmacokinetics.

significant problems with these drugs are uncom-
mon but, in an attempt to produce more potent or
more selective interruption of the renin system, al-
ternative means of blocking the ras have been un-
der development for some time.

giotensinogen) analogues that antagonise the rate-
limiting step of the ras, renin, have been available
for study for nearly 20 years (2). most of the avail-
able agents are not feasible clinical treatments be-
cause they have very low or zero oral bioavailabil-
ity (3) and consequently inadequate net oral po-
tency. until recently, few adequately controlled
studies of humans had demonstrated a blood pres-
sure (bp)-lowering effect with these agents in es-
sential hypertension or in normal human volun-
teers.

of the candidate drugs available,  xxxd3095xxx  (ro
42-5892) has been studied as a p.o. drinking solution
in normal volunteers and hypertensive patients sub-
jected to modest salt restriction, alone (4) and ina
comparative study with enalapril (5). small bp-
lowering effects were demonstrable, but these stud-
ies were not optimally controlled and a dose—
response relationship was not examined. nonethe-
less these studies represent one of the best profiles
available of a renin inhibitor that might be consid-
ered feasible clinical therapy.

we undertook a simple dose-finding study in salt-
depleted norma! volunteers. in this setting, the cir-
culation is dependent on  xxxg99xxx  (aii) for
pressor tone. we previously used this model to
demonstrate consistent bp and hormonal responses
to low doses of acei or ail receptor antagonists
(6,7). the primary aim of this study was to demon-
strate that an oral formulation of  xxxd3095xxx , as dis-
tinct from a simple drinking solution, was able to
induce a decrease in bp as did enalapril and losar-
tan in similar circumstances.

subjects and methods

a single-dose, randomised. placebo-controlled, dose-
escalating cross-over study design was used, involving
three panels of 4 subjects. in each panel. all subjects re-
ceived placebo and three active doses of  xxxd3095xxx  in
random order according to a latin-square design. in each
of the initial two panels, doses were escalated between
panels and the third pane! was used to increase the num-
ber of individuals studies after preliminary review of the
initial two data sets (completed without direct involve-
ment of the investigators responsible for data collection:
r.j.m. and j.l.r.). subjects in panel | received placebo or
30, 100, and 300 mg  xxxd3095xxx , those in panel i] received
placebo 300, 600, and 1,000 mg  xxxd3095xxx , and panel i
received placebo or 30, 600, and 1,000 mg  xxxd3095xxx . all
treatments were administered in double-blind fashion.

twelve healthy male subjects aged 29 + 8 years and
weighing 77 + 10 kg completed the study. before treat-
ment, the volunteers were confirmed to have a normal
clinical history, were free of concomitant medication or
disease, and had a normal physical examination, ecg,
biochemistry (including 24-h urinary sodium excretion
142 + 74 mm with normal diet), and haematology. all
volunteers gave written and informed consent to receive
 xxxd3095xxx  ( xxxd3095xxx ) 100. 300, 600, 1,000 mg or
matched placebo on four separate occasions 2 weeks
apart. before each study day (thursday), the dietary and

j cardiovasc pharmacol", vol. 25, no. 3, 1995

diuretic-mediated salt depletion protocol was constant
(described herein). the protocol was reviewed and ap-
proved by the local research and ethical committee before
start of study.

prestudy preparation

volunteers received a sodium-restricted diet (40 mm/
day) as outpatients, with specific dietary instructions and
a reminder leaflet regarding compliance and allowable ex-
tra caloric intake. concomitantly, for the 3 days before
each study day (days 1-3), subjects received p.o.
 xxxd2167xxx  (40 mg bds at 0800 and 1200 h). dietary salt
restriction continued during the study day (day 4), but the
last p.o. dose of  xxxd2167xxx  was ingested at least 18 h
before dosing with  xxxd3095xxx  or placebo. fluid intake was
encouraged, but alcohol was prohibited during the 3 pre-
study days and for the 24 h of the study day. after re-
ceiving written and verbal instructions regarding tech-
nique of collection, subjects underwent urinary collection
for the 24 h before each study day (day 3 of prestudy
preparation). these collections were started at 0900 h to
coincide with drug dosing at ~0900 h on the following
day, the study day (day 4). pretreatment body weights
were not significantly different between treatment
groups.

procedure

volunteers attended ~0745 h on the study days after an
overnight fast. bringing their prestudy urine collections
for completion predosing. a heparinised venous cannula
was inserted in the nondominant antecubital fossa for
blood sampling purposes. all subjects then rested supine
for at least 1h to equilibrate bp and hormone parameters
in the supine position. all subsequent hormone values
were determined by blood sampling after at least 50-min
supine rest. bp and heart rate (hr) were recorded with
critikon vital signs monitors (critikon, tampa bay, fl,
u.s.a.) in triplicate, both supine and erect (1, 3, and 5
min).

before treatment but after baseline hormone sampling
and bp measurements, subjects emptied their bladder to
complete the prestudy urine collection. dosing (five cap-
sules p.o. on each occasion with double-dummy placebo
as required to maintain the double-blind protocol) was
given with 200 ml orange juice. fluid intake was sched-
uled throughout the study day at 2 h (light breakfast, 200
ml). 5h (lunch, 400 ml). 9 h (evening snack, 400 ml). all
meals were kept within the 40 mm sodium restriction
until 24 h postdosing. volunteers were specifically en-
couraged to take salt with their meals for the 24-48 h after
completing each study cycle to ensure probable reequili-
bration of sodium balance before the next salt-depletion
regimen not less than 10 days later.

analyses

blood samples were collected at frequent intervals dur-
ing the study for determination of drug concentration
(8.9), plasma renin activity (pra) (10), active renin (11),
and serum electrolytes by established assays.  xxxd3095xxx 
was analysed with an improved radioinhibitor binding as-
say with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 ng/ml and inter-
and intra-assay coefficients of variation of 7.2 and 18%,
respectively.

all data are mean + | sd. bp, hormone, and electro-
lyte data were compared by repeated-measures analysis

results

general results and confirmation of salt depletion
and ras activation

all subjects found compliance with the salt-
depletion regimen casy and acceptable. no subject
withdrew from the study, and no biochemical ad-
verse events occurred in pre- and postdosing bio-
chemistry and haematology. two subjects reported
three symptomatic episodes of postural light-
headedness during the study days. subject 5 expe-
rienced light-headedness on standing | h after re-
ceiving 1,000 mg  xxxd3095xxx . subject 8 experienced
postural light-headedness on standing between i-4
h after 600 mg and between i-2 h after 1,000 mg. all
symptoms resolved when subjects lay flat. no epi-
sode was associated with marked decrease in bp
or hr.

salt depletion and activation of ras were con-
firmed by 24-h urinary sodium excretion assess-
ment in the prestudy urinary collection (table 1).
the screening sodium excretion (142 + 74 mmol/24
h) was significantly reduced before all 4 study days
(prestudy sodium excretion; day 1, 66 + 33: day 2,
59 + 41; day 3, 78 + 41; day 4, 73 + 30 mm/24h).
there were no significant changes in prestudy uri-
nary volume or other electrolyte excretions, in
keeping with attenuation of the diuretic and natri-
uretic effect of  xxxd2167xxx  noted in previous studies.

activation of the ras was confirmed by increase
(six-to-nine fold salt-replete values) of pra as com-
pared with screening (0.8 + 0.3 ng al/ml/h) before
dosing on the study days. values of supine renin
were as follows: before ingestion: placebo, 6.5 +
3.1; 30 mg, 8.2 + 13: 100 mg, 9.4 + 5.7; 300 mg, 6.5
+ 2.4; 600 mg, 5.2 + 2; and 1,000 mg, 6.2 + 4.4 ng
al/ml/h.

effects of  xxxd3095xxx  on renin

effects on pra are shown in fig. 1. pra was
clearly reduced dose dependently. mean minimal
renin activity recorded was 30 mg, 1.4 + 1.2: 100
mg, 1.6 + 1; 300 mg, 0.1 + 0.1; 600 mg, 0.1 + 0.1:
1,000 mg, 0.01 + 0.02. in general, the greater the

dose of  xxxd3095xxx , the more protracted the inhibi-
tion of pra after dosing (fig. 1a). in all instances,
minimal recorded renin activity occurred at the first
sampling point | h after dosing (mean time to min-
imal pra: 30 mg, 1.1 + 0.3; 100 mg, | + 0; 300 mg,
1 + 0; 600 mg, 1.3 + 0.4; 1,000 mg, 1.3 + 0.4 h).
in contrast, active renin (fig. 1b) was not greatly
affected by  xxxd3095xxx  until the highest dose (1,000
mg) was given; this dose was clearly associated
with a reactive increase, again usually soon after
dosing (1-2 h). the response, showed significant

effects on bp and hr

despite this clear evidence of a biochemical ef-
fect on renin, neither systolic nor diastolic bp
(sbp, dbp) in the supine posture was significantly
affected by active treatment as compared with pla-
cebo (fig. 2a). erect bp showed a slight and statis-
tically significant decrease from pretreatment val-
ues only after treatment with 1,000 mg  xxxd3095xxx .
sbp decreased | h after dosing and dbp decreased
1 h and 7 h after dosing (fig. 2b).

there were no consistent effects of active treat-
ment on either supine or erect hr (fig. 3). supine
hr also showed an isolated statistically significant
increase after  xxxd3095xxx  1,000 mg at 2 h after dos-
ing, the significance of which is unclear.

drug concentrations

 xxxd3095xxx  was measurable in plasma after active
treatment for limited times after the lower doses (30
mg and 100 mg). these data must be interpreted
cautiously because they are close to the limit of
assay detection (0.5 ng/ml) for several timepoints.
the profile of measured drug concentrations is
shown in fig. 5. there was a wide dose-related
spectrum of mean maximal concentrations (30 mg,
1.07 + 1.64; 100 mg, 2.17 + 1.38: 300 mg, 28.88 +
16.95; 600 mg, 67.76 + 6.06; 1,000 mg, 136.9 +
156.01 ng/ml). values for t,,,,. the time to peak
measured drug concentration in plasma, were vari-
able. generally observed soon after dosing but not
clearly dose related (30 mg, 0.5 + 0.5; 100 mg, 0.56
+ 0.77; 300 mg, 0.66 + 0.51: 600 mg, 0.44 + 0.11:
1.000 mg, 0.94 + 0.63 h).

discussion

the practical application of human renin inhibi-

arguably the most important cardiovascular drugs
to appear in the last 1s years. their efficacy in hy-
pertension and heart failure management is well ac-
cepted. indications for treatment continue to ex-
pand. their precise role in management of myocar-
dial infarction remains to be defined (14). acei
have been the stimulus for many studies document-
ing the role of the renin system in a large range of
physiologic and pathologic processes at organ, cel-
lular, and subcellular levels (15). practically, non-
specific aspects of their action has generated dis-
cussion regarding the role of kinins and/or pros-
taglandins, among other mediators affected by
acei, in the adverse effects observed with these
drugs. similarly, the role of non—-angiotensin-
mediated effects in the beneficial effects of ace
inhibition, e.g., in controlling left ventricular dila-
tation or hypertrophy in hypertension or heart fail-
ure, has also received attention (16,17). the ability
of acei to suppress the renin system completely
during their chronic administration has been chal-
lenged because of the reactive increases in renin
and incomplete suppression of circulating angioten-
sin it (18,19). incomplete suppression does not de-
tract from the well-documented clinical efficacy of
acei, but the development of renin inhibition can

therefore be justified as an attempt to increase the
selectivity and possibly the efficacy of ras block-
ade.

we assessed a major candidate renin inhibitor
considered to have oral activity in hypertension in
clinical and experimental studies (8,20-23). a rea-
sonable body of controlled data is available for only
a few other compounds. the amount of negative
trial data in which  xxxd3095xxx  failed to demonstrate a
bp decrease is unknown. despite clearly docu-
mented activation of the renin system with salt de-
pletion and a diuretic, conditions previously used to
document bp responses to acei (6) or angiotensin
antagonists (7) the bp response to  xxxd3095xxx  we ob-
served was modest. although a statistically signifi-
cant bp decrease was recorded, the absolute extent
of the response was slight. a few hypertensive pa-
tients (4,5) had bp responses similar to those we
observed.

the drug formulation used will influence the re-
sponses. early experience with p.o. solutions may
not indicate the subsequent clinical response, as a
more protracted response might be generated by
sustained-release forms. with  xxxd3095xxx , the bp re-
sponse was short-lived, and would represent a chal-
lenge to pharmaceutical technology. this is a par-
ticular difficulty with renin inhibitors; many have an
oral bioavailability of <1% after oral administration
(23).

in the setting of a renin-dependent circulation us-
ing agents designed to be selective and specific in-
hibitors of renin, it is highly unlikely that the lack of
response demonstrated in the present study would
be markedly different from the response in patients

we used a simple approach to controlled activation
of the ras, uncomplicated by disease-related vari-
ables that can be used to assess drugs affecting the
renin system in normal subjects. this approach may
be undertaken before patient studies and may allow
a more rational choice of drugs and doses in phase
2 and phase 3 studies.

we reaffirmed that pra is an inadequate marker
of inhibition of the renin system likely to be asso-
ciated with a decrease in bp (24) or even redistri-
bution of blood flow. alternative assays such as
active renin are more likely to reflect haemodynam-
ically significant inhibition of the renin system. in
our study, only 1,000 mg  xxxd3095xxx , the only dose
that significantly affected bp. was consistently as-
sociated with a reactive increase in this parameter.
this rise is related to an interruption of the negative
feedback loop of all on renal renin release and is
known to be sensitive to reinfusion of exogenous
ah (25).

the physiologic role of the tissue-based ras and
its relevance to responses to ras blockade by ei-
ther acei inhibitors (26) or more selective agents is
a matter of considerable speculation. clearly, the
poor p.o. bioavailability of current renin inhibitors
affects not only their access to blood across the gut
mucosa but also their regional bioavailability to tis-
sue sites. administered intravenously, these drugs
almost certainly are haemodynamically active un-
der specific conditions (27-30). comparison with
orally active acei, which in several instances are
themselves bioavailable only as prodrugs, is com-
plex, but has been attempted several times (22,31).
in general, low p.o. bioavailability and limited tis-
sue bioavailability in most instances continues to
hamper definition of the non-angiotensin-mediated
haemodynamic effects of acei in such experi-
ments.

selective inhibition of the ras by  xxxd3095xxx 
probably is not a clinically feasible treatment. re-
cently, investigators reported other p.o. active re-
nin inhibitors that reduce bp in humans (32,33), but
the availability of safe and effective p.o. antagonists
of all receptors may have reduced the clinical need
(but not the academic interest) in renin inhibitors.
