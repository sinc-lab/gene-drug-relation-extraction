abstract
recent insights in the role of atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters abcg5 and abcg8, the discovery of ezetimibe, the first
approved direct cholesterol absorption inhibitor, as well as the identification of  xxxg1583xxx  ( xxxg1583xxx ) protein as sterol
transporter in the gut, focused attention on sterol transport processes in the small intestine and the liver. the identification of defective
structures in the abcg5 or abcg8 transporters in patients with the rare disease of sitosterolemia elucidated their role as sterol efflux pumps
regulating at least in parts the intestinal sterol absorption and the hepatic sterol output. abcg5 and abcg8 themselves are regulated by
cholesterol via liver x receptors (lxrs), which are also activated by oxysterols and some derivatives of plant sterols.  xxxg1583xxx  could recently
be identified as a major sterol transporter for the intestinal uptake of cholesterol as well as plant sterols. studies in  xxxg1583xxx  knockout mice
indicate that this transporter is essential for the intestinal uptake of sterols and that  xxxg1583xxx  might also be involved in the mechanism of
action of ezetimibe. however, studies with photoreactive cholesterol as well as with photoreactive ezetimibe analogues suggest that other
processes might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe.

cholesterol homeostasis in man is regulated by wellbalanced mechanisms of intestinal uptake, endogenous
synthesis and metabolism, transport in lipoprotein particles,

and biliary excretion. while hepatic cholesterol homeostasis
was in focus during the last 25 years of research, intestinal
sterol uptake and biliary output transport processes came
into interest during the past 5 years. in the past, cholesterol
uptake in the gut was thought to be controlled mainly by 2
enzymes: acyl coa: xxxg2185xxx  (acat2),
which enhances intracellular sterol esterification, and the
 xxxg1481xxx  (mtp), responsible
for intestinal chylomicron assembly. however, two recently
discovered cholesterol transporter systems in the human gut
brought further insights in the pathways of intestinal
cholesterol absorption and also hepatic sterol excretion.
key elements in the identification of the atp-binding
cassette (abc) transporters abcg5 and abcg8 as bsterol
efflux pumpsq were plant sterols and the disease of
bsitosterolemiaq which is a rare inborn error of sterol
absorption and diminished biliary secretion associated with
elevated plasma levels of plant sterols. the discovery of
ezetimibe, a selective sterol absorption inhibitor, then
focused attention on the intestinal cholesterol influx transporter which helped to reveal the role of the niemann-pick
c1 like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) protein in the intestinal uptake of
cholesterol and plant sterols (fig. 1).

2. plant sterols as indicator for cholesterol transport
plant sterols are naturally occurring sterols and structurally related to cholesterol. at first falsely identified as
cholesterol in peas by beneke in 1862, plant sterols have
been under scientific interest since the early fifties of the
last century (beneke, 1862; peterson, 1951; pollak, 1953a,
1953b). their chemical structure is very similar to that of
cholesterol with a d5 double bond and a 3h-hydroxyl
group but with structural modifications of the side chain
(fig. 2). campesterol and sitosterol, the 24-methyl and the

fig. 2. chemical structure of cholesterol and plant sterols.

24-ethyl analogue of cholesterol, respectively, are the most
abundant plant sterols occurring at low concentrations in
human plasma. they are part of the diet and are
exclusively taken up from the intestine. in minor amounts,
other sterols, such as brassicasterol, avenasterol, ergosterol,
stigmasterol, and even shellfish sterols, could also be
identified in human plasma (gregg et al., 1986; björkhem
et al., 2001). although the dietary intake of plant sterols is
comparable to cholesterol (weihrauch & gardner, 1978;
miettinen et al., 1990; normen et al., 2001), plasma plant
sterols levels are usually less than 1 mg/dl. reasons for
low plasma concentrations are poor intestinal absorption
rates and higher biliary elimination rates as compared to

cholesterol (boberg et al., 1990; sudhop et al., 2002b). in
humans, intestinal cholesterol absorption averages 50%
with a broad interindividual range (20% to 80%). while
some studies in the past reported a relationship between
apo lipoprotein e phenotype and intestinal cholesterol
absorption rates, a more recent study could not confirm
such an influence (kesäniemi et al., 1987; miettinen et al.,
1992; von bergmann et al., 2003). compared to cholesterol absorption rates for sitosterol and campesterol are
lower and in the range of 5–8% and 9–18%, respectively
(borgström, 1969; grundy & ahrens, 1969; grundy et al.,
1969; salen et al., 1970; quintão et al., 1971; connor and
lin, 1974; grundy, 1983; kesäniemi & miettinen, 1987;
czubayko et al., 1991; salen et al., 1992a; heinemann et al.,
1993; lütjohann et al., 1993, 1995, 1996). recent studies in
mice have confirmed that intestinal sterol uptake using a
mixture of different deuterium-labeled sterols (cholesterol,
sitosterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol) into
the intestinal mucosa is a very rapid process (igel et al.,
2003). however, plant sterols and especially their d5saturated derivatives (plant stanols) are rapidly resecreted
into the intestinal lumen resulting in a relative lowabsorption efficacy. absorption rates of plant sterols show
an inverse relationship to their biliary excretion rates; that
is, the less absorbed sterol—sitosterol—has the highest
biliary clearance compared to campesterol and cholesterol
and vice versa supporting the concept that similar transporters which control the intestinal input also might be
responsible for the biliary excretion of these sterols
(sudhop et al., 2002b).

3. sitosterolemia—a prototype
for cholesterol transporter defects
the concept of identical transporters regulating intestinal
sterol absorption as well as biliary sterol excretion was also
supported by the clinical findings in patients with sitosterolemia. sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive inherited
disease with an estimated prevalence of less than 1:5,000,000
(rader et al., 2003). the disease is characterized by increased
plasma plant sterol levels, xanthomas, and premature onset of
atherosclerosis (bhattacharyya & connor, 1974; shulman et
al., 1976; miettinen, 1980). reasons for elevated plasma
plant sterol levels are both an increased intestinal absorption
of all sterols—plant sterols as well as cholesterol—and a
diminished biliary sterol excretion leading to a considerable
storage of noncholesterol sterols in various tissues (miettinen, 1980; salen et al., 1989; bhattacharyya et al., 1991;
salen et al., 1992a, 1992b; lütjohann et al., 1995, 1996;
björkhem et al., 2001). while most patients show only
moderately elevated cholesterol levels, some patients
presented dramatically increased plasma cholesterol levels
with more than 500 mg/dl although cholesterol synthesis is
reduced (nguyen et al., 1990, 1991; lütjohann et al., 1995,
1996; rader et al., 2003). many patients with homozygous

335

sitosterolemia suffer from cardiovascular disease; in some
cases, the onset of coronary artery disease has been
observed at the age of less than 30 (mellies et al., 1976;
miettinen, 1980; salen et al., 1985; kolovou et al., 1996;
katayama et al., 2003; mymin et al., 2003).
the molecular reasons for the increased absorption and
reduced biliary elimination of cholesterol and plant sterols
in sitosterolemia could be identified recently. patel et al.
(1998) mapped sitosterolemia to a special gene locus
(stsl) on the human chromosome 2p21. thereafter, berge
et al. (2000) identified the 2 abcg5 and abcg8 transporters, where either the abcg5 or abcg8 transporter was
defective in patients with sitosterolemia. these results could
be confirmed by other groups (hubacek et al., 2001; lee et
al., 2001; heimer et al., 2002; sehayek et al., 2004). the
abcg5 and abcg8 half transporters are both expressed at
the apical membrane of the intestinal mucosa cells and at the
canalicular membrane in the liver. in both locations, they
work as efflux pumps and transport free sterols out of the
cell either back into the intestinal lumen or into the bile,
thereby regulating the absorption as well as the biliary
secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols (yu et al., 2002a,
2002b; kosters et al., 2003; wang, 2003; klett et al., 2004;
wu et al., 2004). this explains that in patients with
sitosterolemia who have either a defective abcg5 or
abcg8 gene, increased intestinal sterol absorption and
also diminished biliary sterol elimination is observed
(miettinen, 1980). however, despite the higher absorption
of cholesterol and plant sterols in patients with sitosterolemia, patients with sitosterolemia still differentiate
between cholesterol, campesterol, and sitosterol (lütjohann
et al., 1995; yu et al., 2002a). both transporters may also
contribute to the relatively high heritability of plant sterol
levels and several polymorphisms in the abcg5 and
abcg8 genes have been identified which in parts
moderately influence plasma sterols and insulin sensitivity
(hubacek et al., 2001; berge et al., 2002; weggemans et al.,
2002; gylling et al., 2004).

4. regulation of abcg5 and abcg8
the expression of abcg5 and abcg8 transporters
seems to be controlled by dietary cholesterol via liver x
receptors (lxr).  xxxg1596xxx  and lxrh are nuclear receptors
which regulate many key genes in cellular sterol metabolism. lxrs are expressed in most tissues and are activated
by endogenous oxysterols such as 22(r)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(s),25-epoxycholesterol, 24s- and 27-hydroxycholesterol (repa & mangelsdorf, 2000; fu et al., 2001;
edwards et al., 2002; lund et al., 2003). lxrs regulate
their target genes in the form of heterodimers with the 9cis- xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rxrs) which bind to lxrresponse elements in the regulatory regions. besides the
regulation of abcg5 and abcg8, the target genes also
include the  xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg21xxx  transporters. dietary

336

t. sudhop et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 105 (2005) 333–341

cholesterol feeding leads to an increase in the expression of
the abcg5 and abcg8 transporters in mice which is
controlled by the activation of lxrs (berge et al., 2000;
repa et al., 2002a). experiments in  xxxg1596xxx  und lxrh
knockout mice could show that lxrs are essential for
cholesterol-induced up-regulation of abcg5 and abcg8
transporters (repa et al., 2002a), while experiments in
abcg5/abcg8 knockout mice indicate that the stimulation of cholesterol excretion by lxrs agonists, such as
 xxxd3269xxx , requires intact abcg5 and abcg8 transporters
(yu et al., 2003). the latter experiments could also confirm
that activation of lxrs is associated with an increase in
biliary cholesterol secretion and a decrease in intestinal
cholesterol absorption. nonsteroidal synthetic lxr agonists, such as  xxxd3269xxx , enhance the expression of abcg5
and abcg8 as sterol efflux transporters and also increase
the expression of fatty acid synthesis genes such as acetyl
coa carboxylase,  xxxg765xxx , and stearyl coa
desaturase-1, leading to an increase in plasma triglycerides
and phospholipids (schultz et al., 2000; repa et al., 2002a).
the observation that incubation with mixed micelles
enriched with sitostanol—the d5 saturated homologue of
sitosterol—led to an increase in  xxxg9xxx  expression in
caco2 cells, which is also lxr-mediated, raises the
question whether plant sterols themselves or plant sterol
derivatives have the capability to activate lxrs. kaneko et
al. (2003) screened ergosterol, brassicasterol, fucosterol,
campesterol, and stigmasterol derivatives for lxr activation. while plant sterols themselves did not exert any
relevant  xxxg1596xxx  activation, several plant sterol derivatives
showed similar  xxxg1596xxx  activation capacities such as
24(s),25-epoxycholesterol. interestingly, oral administration of the most potent derivative, yt-32 ((22e)-ergost-22ene-1a,3h-diol), led to a selective activation of abc
transporters in the gut and consecutive reduction in
cholesterol absorption with only moderate effects in the
liver and without increase of plasma triglycerides as
observed in the nonsteroidal lxr agonists. the reason
for the observed gut selectivity of yt-32 is unclear and
might depend on a perhaps low systemic bioavailability of
yt-32, as already speculated by the authors. however,
these experiments also suggest that it might be possible to
construct gut-selective lxr agonists which reduce plasma
cholesterol by reducing cholesterol absorption without
lipogenic effects in the liver.

5. cholesterol absorption inhibitors
and the intestinal cholesterol transporter
the discovery of ezetimibe as a direct inhibitor of
intestinal cholesterol absorption has focused attention on a
putative sterol influx transporter which might be the target
for ezetimibe (rosenblum et al., 1998; vaccaro and davis,
1998; vaccaro et al., 1998). ezetimibe is the first approved
member of a new chemical drug class—the 2-azetidinones.

originally developed as acat inhibitors, it soon became
clear that 2-azetidinones did not inhibit acat2 in a
relevant manner, but do block the intestinal absorption of
cholesterol (clader, 2004). in various animal models,
ezetimibe lowers intestinal absorption of cholesterol dose
dependently up to 96% and thereby decreases plasma total
and ldl cholesterol (van heek et al., 2000, 2001). in
humans, in a study in 18 male subjects with mild to
moderate hypercholesterolemia, daily treatment with 10
mg ezetimibe over 14 days reduced intestinal cholesterol
absorption on the average by 54% and increased fecal
excretion of cholesterol and its bacterial degradation
products by 72% resulting in a ldl cholesterol reduction
of 22.3% compared to placebo (sudhop et al., 2002a).
interestingly, inhibition of cholesterol absorption was
accompanied by a marked increase in cholesterol synthesis,
indicating that a combination with cholesterol synthesis
inhibitors such as statins could be an additive therapeutic
approach. the moderate ldl cholesterol lowering effect
in the range of 18–20% could be confirmed in several
phase ii and phase iii trials (bays et al., 2001; knopp et
al., 2003). therefore, the main indication for ezetimibe is a
combination therapy with statins. several trials with all
major statins confirmed the additive effects of the
combination therapy (davidson et al., 2002; ballantyne
et al., 2003; kerzner et al., 2003; melani et al., 2003;
ballantyne et al., 2004; goldberg et al., 2004), and
recently a simvastatin/ezetimibe combination tablet has
been approved in several countries in europe. although
ezetimibe is considered to be a cholesterol absorption
inhibitor, it is not selective for cholesterol, but also lowers
plasma levels of plant sterols (sudhop et al., 2002a). this
effect was also investigated in a placebo controlled trial in
37 patients with sitosterolemia. compared to placebo
treatment with ezetimibe (10 mg/day), over 8 weeks
resulted in a 25% and 27% reduction in plasma levels of
sitosterol and campesterol, respectively, due to decreased
uptake, but accompanied by an increase in endogenous
cholesterol synthesis (salen et al., 2004).
although ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol and plant sterols in an impressive manner, the exact
mechanism of action is still unclear. studies with intravenously administered 3h-labeled ezetimibe found that
ezetimibe localizes to the intestinal brush border membrane (van heek et al., 2000). since it was clear that
ezetimibe has to interfere with molecular structures that
are thought to be involved in intestinal sterol absorption,
studies on several abc transporters as well as the
scavenger receptor class b type i ( xxxg2013xxx ) were performed. it could be shown that ezetimibe does not act via
regulation of  xxxg9xxx , abcg5, or abcg8 transporters
(repa et al., 2002b). although it could be demonstrated
that ezetimibe binds to the intestinal  xxxg2013xxx  receptor, it
could also be shown in the same study that ezetimibe was
also effective in  xxxg2013xxx  knockout mice and that there was
no difference in the response to ezetimibe compared with

t. sudhop et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 105 (2005) 333–341

wild-type mice. thus, it seems unlikely that ezetimibe
acts mainly via interactions with  xxxg2013xxx  (altmann et al.,
2002).
kramer and colleagues also investigated potential target
structures of ezetimibe with the help of photoreactive
derivatives of 2-azetidinones and a photoreactive cholesterol derivative (photocholesterol=[3a-3h]-6-azi-5a-cholestan-3h-ol) (kramer et al., 2000, 2003; frick et al., 2003).
using photocholesterol, they identified a 80-kda integral
membrane protein in the small intestine brush border
membrane of the rabbit, while the photoreactive analogue
of ezetimibe was found to bind to another 145-kda integral
membrane protein. they could demonstrate that the latter
145-kda target was distinct from  xxxg9xxx , abcg5, and
abcg8 transporters as well as from  xxxg2013xxx . interestingly,
there was no competition in the binding of the 2azetidinone at the 145-kda protein with cholesterol.
however, binding of photocholesterol to the 80-kda
cholesterol-binding protein could be inhibited concentration
dependently by cholesterol as well as sitosterol and
campesterol, while cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such
as ezetimibe, had no influence on the binding of photocholesterol to the putative 80-kda cholesterol-binding
protein.

6.  xxxg1583xxx  protein as intestinal cholesterol transporter
recently, altmann et al. (2004) and davis et al. (2004)
reported the identification of the  xxxg1583xxx  protein as
intestinal cholesterol transporter. searching special
genomic databases for transcripts containing anticipated
features of a sterol transporter they could identify the rat
homologue of the human  xxxg1583xxx  gene as putative target
structure. the  xxxg1583xxx  gene has a 50% amino acid
homology to the niemann-pick c 1 gene which is affected
in the cholesterol storage disease niemann-pick type c
(davies et al., 2000; ioannou, 2000; park et al., 2003).
when assessing the  xxxg1583xxx  mrna expression in human
tissues, altmann et al. (2004) found the highest levels in
small intestine, gall bladder, and stomach, but also other
tissues, such as heart, lung, and colon, expressed  xxxg1583xxx 
mrna. in rats, they analyzed the distribution of  xxxg1583xxx 
mrna in 10-cm segments across the small intestine and
found the highest (villin adjusted) levels in the proximal
jejunum with a steady decrease towards the ileocolic valve.
applying in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry,
they were able to identify cell-specific  xxxg1583xxx  mrna
and protein expression in the rat jejunum near to the
luminal space and suggest that  xxxg1583xxx  protein is
predominantly associated with the apical membrane of
the enterocyte. later experiments using a lacz-neo
cassette and a h-galactosidase histochemical reaction in
 xxxg1583xxx  knockout mice ( xxxg1583xxx  / ) confirmed the
predominant expression of  xxxg1583xxx  in the proximal
jejunum (davis et al., 2004).

337

7. effects of  xxxg1583xxx  protein
generating  xxxg1583xxx  knockout mice ( xxxg1583xxx  / ), the
same research team performed numerous experiments on
cholesterol and sitosterol absorption in these animals
(altmann et al., 2004; davis et al., 2004). while
 xxxg1583xxx  / mice did not show any morphological
abnormalities compared with heterozygous and wild-type
mice, they showed a significantly lower fractional cholesterol absorption rate of 15.6f0.4% compared to 45f4% in
heterozygous and 51f3% in wild-type animals (altmann
et al., 2004). despite the reduced cholesterol absorption
rate, the knockout animals had comparable plasma lipids
but showed a (compensatory) 3.3- to 3.8-fold increase of
the hmg coa synthase mrna in gut and liver without
affecting abcg5 and abcg8 mrna expression in the
gut. adding ezetimibe lowers cholesterol absorption rates
in the  xxxg1583xxx +/ and in the  xxxg1583xxx +/+ animals to almost
the same level as observed in untreated knockout mice,
while the  xxxg1583xxx  / mice did not exert further decrease
in cholesterol absorption by ezetimibe. while plasma levels
of cholesterol and triglycerides were comparable between
wild-type, heterozygous, and knockout animals, significant
differences were observed for plant sterols (davis et al.,
2004). compared with  xxxg1583xxx +/+ animals, heterozygous
 xxxg1583xxx +/ mice had 37% and 50% lower plasma levels of
sitosterol and campesterol, respectively, while  xxxg1583xxx  /
mice had even more than 90% lower plasma concentrations
of both plant sterols. using 3h-labeled sitosterol, the
authors could also demonstrate a 64% reduced intestinal
sitosterol absorption in  xxxg1583xxx  / mice compared to
 xxxg1583xxx +/+ animals, which was comparable to the effect of
a single 10 mg dose of ezetimibe in  xxxg1583xxx +/+ mice.
despite the similarity of  xxxg1583xxx  knockout and ezetimibetreated wild-type mice, direct binding of ezetimibe to
 xxxg1583xxx  as well as the reconstitution of a transmembrane
cholesterol transporter in nonenterocytes by overexpression
of  xxxg1583xxx  could not be demonstrated. the authors
discussed that issue and suggested that additional subunits
or further components might be necessary to reconstitute a
fully functional cholesterol transporter (altmann et al.,
2004).

8. annexin 2- xxxg346xxx 
complex as potential target of ezetimibe
recently, smart et al. (2004) published their experiments on disrupting putative sterol processing genes in
zebra fish larvae and mouse intestine. they discovered a
stable 55-kda complex of annexin 2 ( xxxg165xxx ) and
 xxxg346xxx  ( xxxg346xxx ) which seems to be involved in
intracellular sterol trafficking. while the complex was
robust against usual disruption procedures indicating that
covalent binding might be involved in the complex
formation, incubation with ezetimibe led to a complete

338

t. sudhop et al. / pharmacology & therapeutics 105 (2005) 333–341

disruption of the  xxxg346xxx - xxxg165xxx  complex in early state
zebrafish embryos. in c57bl/6 mice orally administered,
ezetimibe only disrupted the  xxxg346xxx - xxxg165xxx  complex in
animals fed with a high-fat western diet, while in chowfed animals, the  xxxg346xxx - xxxg165xxx  complex was not affected
by ezetimibe. from immunoprecipitation experiments, the
authors conclude that ezetimibe disrupts the  xxxg346xxx - xxxg165xxx 
complex most likely by direct interaction with the  xxxg346xxx 
protein.

relevant lipogenic effects is a very interesting discovery and
might help to develop abcg5/abcg8-based sterol absorption inhibitors.
finally, both concepts—inhibiting sterol influx and
enhancing sterol efflux—would be associated with an
increase in cholesterol synthesis as already observed with
ezetimibe and in  xxxg1583xxx  / mice. however, the combination of these agents with statins, as already practiced with
ezetimibe, should be able to compensate the compensatory
increase in cholesterol synthesis and probably would lead to
additive effects.

9. conclusion
with the discovery of the abcg5 and abcg8 genes
encoding important sterol efflux transporter in the intestine
and the liver and with  xxxg1583xxx  protein as intestinal
cholesterol transporter, important new insights in the
regulation of cholesterol and natural sterol transport
processes could be obtained. while the role of abcg5
and abcg8 transporters as efflux pumps in enterocytes and
hepatocytes could be demonstrated and the identification of
mutations in the corresponding genes could explain the
clinical findings in sitosterolemia, the role of  xxxg1583xxx  is
more complex. the data in  xxxg1583xxx  knockout mice
impressively suggest that  xxxg1583xxx  is crucial for the
intestinal uptake of cholesterol and plant sterols. whether
 xxxg1583xxx  protein is identical with the cholesterol-binding
85-kda protein identified by kramer et al. (2000, 2003) has
to be investigated. the finding that the cholesterol-binding
protein is different from the 2-azetidinone-binding protein
could explain why altmann and colleagues failed to show
that 2-azetidinones bind to  xxxg1583xxx  protein. this might
mean that intestinal cholesterol transporters might consist of
several units that act together as sterol-transporting components. although many findings indicate that ezetimibe and
other 2-azetidinones act via  xxxg1583xxx , the final proof is still
missing (klett & patel, 2004). the observation of smart
and colleagues that ezetimibe also interferes with sterol
trafficking proteins, such as the discovered stable cav1anx2 complex, might suggest that the effect of ezetimibe
is not exclusively bound to  xxxg1583xxx  protein. nevertheless,
davis and altmann could demonstrate that  xxxg1583xxx 
knockout mice behave very similarly to wild-type mice
treated with ezetimibe, and clinical data on ezetimibe could
also demonstrate that the concept of inhibiting intestinal
absorption of neutral sterols is beneficial in both patients
with hypercholesterolemia as well as in patients with
sitosterolemia.
in contrast to  xxxg1583xxx , the role of abcg5 and abcg8
transporters are better understood, but the development of
pharmacological active agents acting via activation of
abcg5 and abcg8 are at a very early stage. while
synthetic nonsteroidal lxr activators also up-regulate the
expression of lipogenic genes in the liver leading to
unwanted side effects such as hypertriglyceridemia, the
identification of plant sterol-derived lxr activators without
