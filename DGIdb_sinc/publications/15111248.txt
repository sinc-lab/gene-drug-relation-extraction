the effects of sibutramine on central dopaminergic
system in rats and mice were examined by neurochemical and behavioral pharmacological methods.
dopamine reuptake inhibition by sibutramine in brain
synaptosomes was only 4-5 times stronger than those
of amitriptyline and dosulepin, which do not exhibit
dopamine uptake inhibition in vivo. single treatment
with sibutramine did not alter the brain content of
dopamine and dopac. however, similar to methamphetamine and  xxxd2850xxx , sibutramine antagonized
methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (mptp)
induced dopamine depletion in mouse brain. in
forced swimming tests of reserpinized mice, sibutramine shortened the immobilized time, similar to
dopaminergic drugs including  xxxd2746xxx , bupropion (dopamine-reuptake inhibitor), methamphetamine, skf 38393 (dopamine d1 agonist), quinpirole
(dopamine d2 agonist) and apomorphine (dopamine
d1/d2 agonist). in addition, sibutramine caused rotational behavior toward the lesioned side in rats with
unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra induced by
6-hydroxydopamine. these results suggest that sibutramine exhibits neurochemical and behavioral
dopaminomimetic activity in vivo, which is mediated
by dopamine reuptake inhibition by the active metabolites of sibutramine.

the dopaminergic system is known to plays
important roles in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, schizophrenia, childhood attention-deficit disorder, anorexia nervosa, and
memory deficits. recently, several reports have
suggested that depression is also related to disorder of the dopaminergic system. reserpine-induced prolongation of immobilized time
in the forced swimming test is related to the
degree of depletion of brain dopamine (bourin,
1990; colpaert, 1987; lorenc et al, 1995; miyagi et
al, 1996; zarrindast and minaian, 1991).
although the effects of tricyclic antidepressants
are known to be mediated by inhibition of
uptake of 5-ht and norepinephrine, a recent
study showed that these drugs also activate the
limbic dopaminergic system. in fact, atypical
antidepressants

dopamine

reuptake such as bupropion and  xxxd2746xxx 
have recently been developed (rudorfer and
potter, 1989). in the initial phase of development
of sibutramine (bts 54-524, | meridia) as an
antidepressant, it was evaluated as a 5-ht and
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. however, its
body weight reducing-effect was identified in
clinical phase i study, and it has recently been
developed as an anti-obesity drug. obesity is
caused by imbalance between caloric intake and
energy expenditure, e.g., by exercise and
pyrexia. activation of the dopaminergic
nigro-striatal pathway, which increases motor
activity, is very important as an energy expenditure system (ganong, 1999). however, little
attention has been paid to the dopaminergic
effects of sibutramine.
previously, it was demonstrated that sibutramine weakly, and its metabolite strongly,
inhibited 3h-dopamine uptake in rat brain synaptosomes (luscombe et al, 1989b). however,
there are no confirmative data in living animals
demonstrating the effects of sibutramine mediated via the central dopaminergic system (heal
et al., 1992). in the present study, effects of sibutramine on central dopaminergic system in rats
and mice were examined by neurochemical and
various behavioral pharmacological tests.

materials a n d methods
animals

male slc: wistar rats aged 10 - 12 weeks and
male slc: icr mice aged 5 weeks purchased from
slc (shizuoka) were used. the animals were
acclimated for one week or longer in a room at
21 - 23~ and 50 - 70% humidity with a 12-hour
light/dark cycle (light: 7 a.m. - 7 p.m.). the animals had free access to food and water. handling and treatment of the animals were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of
the japanese society for experimental animals.

drugs

drugs were dissolved in distilled water for oral
administration (po), and with physiological
saline for subcutaneous injection (sc) and intraperitoneal injection (ip) at a dose volume of
0.5 ml per 100 g body weight. sibutramine hci
and dosulepin hc1 (prothiaden| were synthesized by kaken pharmaceutical (tokyo). methamphetamine hc1 (philopon|
pentobarbital
na (nembutal injection| dissolved in distilled
water) and reserpine ( xxxd3100xxx  injection| dissolved in distilled water) were purchased from
dainippon pharmaceutical and daiichi pharmaceutical. other drugs and standards for
high-performance
liquid
chromatography
(hplc) were obtained from rbi (funakoshi,
tokyo) and sigma (st. louis, mo, usa).
3h-dopamine (3,4-[8-h (n)] dihydroxy-phenylethylamine) was purchased from new england nuclear co. (boston, ma, usa).
statistical analysis

the randomized block design was used. for statistical treatment of experimental data, one-way
layout analysis of variance was used, and comparison with the control group was performed
by dunnett's t-test. in the examination for synergistic effects, the single administration group
and combined administration group for each
drug underwent 2 x 2 factorial experiment in
time series (repeated measurements designs), p
values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
ed50 and id50 were calculated by the probit
method, and the potency ratio was obtained by
parallel line assay.

in mouse whole brain
into 8 mice in each group, 5 0 m g / k g of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(mptp) was subcutaneously iniected. after 30
minutes, a test drug was orally administered.
one week after administration, the brain was
extracted by decapitation, and subjected to
monoamine extraction and analysis similar to
those in the above experiment. the amount of
each monoamine was expressed as a percentage
of the mean of the amount in the non-treatment
control animals subjected to subcutaneous injection of physiological saline.

effects on 6-hydroxydopa-induced norepinephrine depletion in mouse whole brain
for 8 animals in each group, 1 5 0 m g / k g of
6-hydroxydopa and 1 5 m g / k g of carbidopa
were simultaneously injected into the peritoneal
cavity, and 60 minutes later a test drug was
orally administered. at 20 minutes after administration of test drug, the whole brain was
extracted by decapitation, and subjected to
monoamine extraction and analysis similar to
those in the above experiment. the amount of
each monoamine was expressed as a percentage
of the mean of the amount in the non-treatment
control animals subjected to intraperitoneal
injection of physiological saline.

effects on p-chloroamphetamine-induced 5-ht
depletion in mouse whole brain
to 8 animals in each group, 10 m g / k g of p-chloroamphetamine was injected into the peritoneal
cavity, and 60 minutes later a test drug was
orally administered. at 6 hours after administration of test drug, the whole brain was extracted
by decapitation, and subjected to monoamine
extraction and analysis similar to those in the
above experiment. the amount of each monoamine was expressed as a percentage of the mean of
the amount in the non-treatment control animals
subjected to intraperitoneal injection of physiological saline.
inhibition of 3h-dopamine uptake
by synaptosomes of rat whole brain
the whole brain extracted by decapitation was
homogenized in 9 volumes of 0.3 m sucrose p h
7.4 with a positron homogenizer (ultra-dispenser
lk-21, yamato) while ice-cooled. the homogenate was centrifuged at 60,000 x g at 4~ for 20
minutes with an ultra-centrifuge (20pr-52,
hitachi, tokyo), and synaptosomes were isolated in the p2 fraction. to 50 gl of synaptosome
suspension, 800 ~1 krebs-ringer phosphate
buffer, 100 ~1 of test drug and 3h-dopamine
(final concentration: 5 x 10-8 m) were added,
and the mixture was incubated at 37~ for 20
minutes. the mixture was filtered with a gf/b
filter (whatman, tokyo), and radioactivity on
the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter.
effects on immobilized time during forced
swimming in mice
six mice per group were used for this test. when
a mouse is forced to swim in a cylinder, it moves
its extremities vigorously trying to escape and
swims around inside the cylinder. however,
after a few minutes, it stops moving and stays
floating. this is called the despairing state, and

forced swimming in a cylinder 11 cm in diameter and 15 cm deep containing 25~ water for 6
minutes daily for 3 consecutive days. on the following day, a test drug was intraperitoneally
injected, and 30 minutes later immobilized time
(sec) was measured over 6 minutes using a
home-made apparatus for automatic measurement of immobilized time during forced swimming (nakagawa et al, 1988). in the reserpine
treatment test, 3 m g / k g of reserpine was subcutaneously administered after the third day of
forced swimming training. after 16 hours (the
following day), a test drug was administered
into the peritoneal cavity, and the a m o u n t of
immobilized time (sec) during 6 minutes was
measured 30 minutes later.

effects on rotational behavior of rats with
unilateral lesions of substantia nigra induced
by 6-hydroxydopamine
unilateral lesioning of the substantia nigra was
performed as follows: the head of a rat anesthetized with 40 m g / k g of pentobarbital na (ip)
was fixed using a stereotaxic frame (sr-5, narishige, tokyo). according to the stereotaxic atlas
of the brain of fifkova and marsara (1967), a
stainless steel guide cannula was inserted into
the right substantia nigra, and 8 ~g (4 ~tl in 4
min) of 6-hydroxydopamine in physiological
saline containing 0.1%  xxxd228xxx  was
injected. following a one-week period after
operation for recovery, each animal was placed
in a round observation box 46 cm in internal

effects on mptp-induced dopamine depletion
in mouse whole brain

effects on 6-hydroxydopa-induced norepinephrine depletion in mouse whole brain

mptp at a dose of 50 mg/kg (sc) significantly
decreased dopamine content in mouse whole
brain to about 70% of that in mice receiving
physiological saline (sc) (p<0.01). contents of the
dopamine metabolites hva and dopac also
decreased to 85% and 80%, respectively. contents of norepinephrine, 5-ht and 5-hiaa were
not significantly affected. methamphetamine at
doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg (po), sibutramine  xxxd1891xxx 
and 30 mg/kg (po) and  xxxd2850xxx  at 30, 100 and
300mg/kg (po) antagonized the dopamine
depletion induced by mptp (p<0.01). however,
none of dosulepin, amitriptyline, imipramine,
desipramine, clomipramine, maprotiline and
 xxxd2637xxx  had
significant effects
on
mptp-induced dopamine depletion at doses of
10, 30 or 90 mg/kg (po) (fig. 2).

a dose of 150 mg/kg of 6-hydroxydopa (ip) plus
15 mg/kg of carbidopa (ip) decreased norepinephrine content in mouse whole brain to about
50% of that with physiological saline (sc)
(p<0.01), but did not significantly affect contents
of dopamine, dopac or 5-ht. on the other
hand, it increased hva and 5-hiaa contents
(p<0.01). metharnphetamine at a dose of
3 mg/kg (po), sibutramine at 3 and 10 mg/kg
(po), dosulepin at 80 mg/kg (po), amitriptyline
at 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg (po), imipramine at 40
and 80 mg/kg (po), and maprotiline at 20, 40
and 80 mg/kg (po) antagonized the norepinephrine depletion induced by 6-hydroxydopa
(p<0.01) (fig. 3).

following treatment with 1 0 m g / k g (ip) of
p-chloroamphetamine, 5-ht, 5-hiaa and
dopac contents in mouse whole brain
decreased to about 50% of those in the control
group receiving physiological saline (sc)
(p<0.01), but contents of norepinephrine,
dopamine and the dopamine metabolite hva
were not significantly affected. methamphetamine at a dose of 3 m g / k g (po), sibutramine at 3
and 10 m g / k g (po), dosulepin at 80 m g / k g (po),
and amitriptyline at 40 and 8 0 m g / k g (po)
antagonized the 5-ht depletion induced by
p-chloroamphetamine (p<0.05) (fig. 4).
inhibition of 3h-dopamine uptake
by synaptosomes of rat whole brain

sibutramine, dosulepin, amitriptyline, imi~hramine and maprotiline each inhibited
-dopamine uptake, with parallel inhibition
curves. their ic50s (95% confidence limit) were
2.0 (1.4 - 3.0), 9.6 (7.4 - 13), 8.0 (5.8 - 12.0), 15.0
(12.0 - 20.0) and 13.0 (9.7 - 16.0) ~m, respectively. the inhibition by sibutramine of
dopamine uptake was 4 - 8 times stronger than
that by dosulepin, amitriptyline, imipramine
and maprotiline (table ii).
effects on immobilized time during forced
swimming in mice

methamphetamine shortened the immobilized
time at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 m g / k g (ip) in the
non-treatment group, and at doses of 1 and

243

2 m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment
group (p<0.05, <0.01). sibutramine shortened the
immobilized time at doses of 3 and 10 m g / k g
(ip) in the non-treatment group, and at
1 0 m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment
group (p<0.01).  xxxd2746xxx  shortened the
immobilized time at doses of 3, 10 and 30 m g / k g
(ip) in the non-treatment group, and  xxxd1891xxx  and
3 0 m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment
group (p<0.05, <0.01). apomorphine shortened
the immobilized time at doses of i and 3 m g / k g
(ip) in the non-treatment group, and at doses of
0.3 and i m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment group (p<0.01). no effect on immobilized
time was found at a high dose of 3 m g / k g (ip) of
apomorphine in the reserpine pretreatment
group. dosu!epin shortened the immobilized
time at doses of 40 and 80 m g / k g (ip) in the
non-treatment group (p<0.05, <0.01), but had no
effect on it at 20, 40 or 80 m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment group. quinpirole shortened
the immobilized time at doses of i and 3 m g / k g
(ip) in the non-treatment group, and at doses of 1
and 3 m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment
group (p<0.01). skf 38393 shortened the immobilized time at doses of 30 m g / k g (ip) in the
non-treatment group, and at doses of 3, 10 and
3 0 m g / k g (ip) in the reserpine-pretreatment
group (p<0.05, <0.01). in the reserpine-pretreatment group, when 0.3 m g / k g of quinpirole and
i m g / k g of skf 38393, neither of which affected
immobilized time individually, were administered in combination, significant synergistic
shortening of immobilized time was observed
(p<0.01) (table iii).

apomorphine at a dose of i m g / k g (ip) caused
contralateral rotational behavior (p<0.01) methamphetamine at i m g / k g (ip) and sibutramine
at 3 - 80 m g / k g (po) each caused ipsilateral rotational behavior (p<0.01). the tricyclic antidepressants dosulepin and amitriptyline did not
affect rotational behavior at doses of 10 80 m g / k g (po) (table 4).

discussion

dopamine is uptaken presynaptically and
metabolized by mao to dopac, which is
released presynaptically into the synaptic cleft.
similarly, mptp is metabolized by mao and
converted to methyl-4-phenylpyridinium(mpp+),

which causes depletion of dopamine (melamed
et al, 1985; shen et al, 1985; tadano et al, 1987).
6-hydroxydopa (evans and cohen, 1989;
jacobowitz and kostrzewa, 1971) and p-chloroamphetamine (buckett et al, 1988; luscombe et
al, 1989a) are also taken up into the presynaptic
side of nerve endings via each monoamine

dopaminergic effect of sibutramine

reuptake sites, and deplete norepinephrine and
5-ht, respectively. the present study showed
that a mao inhibitor,  xxxd2850xxx , increased
dopamine concentration and lowered the concentration of dopac in mouse whole brain tissue by inhibiting dopamine metabolism, and
antagonized mptp-induced dopamine depletion by inhibiting metabolism from mptp to
mpp +, methamphetamine decreased dopamine
and dopac contents in mouse whole brain tissue. these effects of methamphetamine might
have been due to promotion of monoamine
release and inhibition of reuptake, as reported
by kita et al (1995). in the present study, sibutramine affected neither dopamine nor dopac
content of mouse whole brain tissue. heal et al.
(1990, 1992) showed that in rat striatal slices
dopamine-releasing drugs such as methamphetamine increased the content of 3-methoxytyramine, a dopamine metabolite, but
sibutramine did not affect 3-methoxytyramine
content. these results concerning monoamines
in mouse whole brain tissue show that sibutramine does not release monoamine, as does
methamphetamine (heal et al, 1992), and does
not inhibit monoamine oxidase, as does  xxxd2850xxx . sibutramine antagonized not only
6-hydroxydopa-induced norepinephrine depletion and p-chloroamphetamine-induced 5-ht
depletion but also mptp-induced dopamine
depletion. in our previous free-moving microdialysis study, we found that sibutramine
increased extracellular concentrations of
dopamine and 5-ht by about 1.6 and 4.5 times,
respectively, in the caudate-putamen, and these
increases appeared to be due to dopamine and
5-ht uptake inhibiting effects of sibutramine
(nakagawa et al, 1998). cheetham et al. (1993,
1996) and luscombe et al. (1989a) reported that
sibutramine inhibits dopamine reuptake in vivo
with 1/3 to 1/4 the potency of norepinephrine
and 5-ht. their reports supported our finding
that the inhibition by sibutramine of reuptake of
three amines exhibits little selevtivity. however,
in the present in vitro study, it was demon-

245

strated that inhibition by sibutramine of
dopamine reuptake in brain synaptosomes was
only 4-5 times stronger than that by amitriptyline and dosulepin. dopamine reuptake inhibition in vitro by the active metabolites of
sibutramine, bts 54 354 and bts 54 505, was
about 100 times stronger than that by sibutramine and nearly equal to that by  xxxd2746xxx ,
an inhibitor of dopamine reuptake (luscombe et
al, 1989b). since the inhibitory effect of sibutramine itself on dopamine reuptake appears to
be weak, the inhibition of uptake of dopamine
by sibutramine in vivo may instead be due to
active metabolites of sibutramine.

it has already been reported that sibutramine
and dosulepin antagonized reserpine-and
 xxxd3330xxx -induced ptosis and hypothermia
(benesova et al, 1964; heal, 1992; luscombe et al,
1989b; n a k a g a w a et al, 1993). sibutramine shortened the immobilized time during forced swimming in both the non-treated group and
reserpine-pretreated group in the present study,
similar to methamphetamine, apomorphine, a
dopamine d1, d2 agonist, and  xxxd2746xxx , an
inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. since apomorphine, bupropion, bromocriptine and quinpirole
(dopamine d2 agonist) each shortened immobilized time, but skf 38393 (dopamine d1 agonist)
did not, in forced swimming tests of reserpine-treated mice, zarrindast and minaian
(1991) surmised that dopamine d2 receptors
play important roles in shortening the immobilized time during forced swimming tests of such
mice. however, in the present study, skf 38393
alone shortened immobilized time but also
enhanced shortening of immobilized time w h e n
administered together with quinpirole. therefore, both dopamine d2 receptors and dopamine
d1 receptors play important roles in shortening
immobilized time in forced swimming tests of
reserpine-treated mice. we have already
reported that sibutramine, similar to other
dopaminomimetic drugs, antagonized reserpine-induced impairment of active avoidance
and reserpine-induced lowering of hippocampal
theta-wave frequency (masuda et al, 1989; nakagawa et al, 1997). these previous findings support the results of the present study.
different from the findings of heal et al.
(1992), in the present study, we demonstrated
that sibutramine induced ipsilateral rotational
behavior similar to methamphetamine, a
dopamine releaser (fujita et al, 1996; pieri, m. et
al, 1975),  xxxd2746xxx  (costall et al, 1975),  xxxd2546xxx  (heikkila et al, 1981) and bupropion (heal
et al, 1992). therefore, sibutramine acts on the
presynaptic side of dopaminergic neurons in the
caudate-putamen. since the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, imipramine and dosulepin

did not affect rotational behavior individually
(fukuda and tsumagari, 1984), they are believed
to have no effects on dopaminergic nerve endings in the caudate-putamen (nakagawa et al,
1998).
these results suggest that sibutramine exhibits
neurochemical and behavioral dopaminomimetic activity in vivo, which is mediated by
dopamine reuptake inhibition by the active
metabolites of sibutramine.
