background: intravenous anesthetics cause amnesia, but the
underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. recent studies reveal a significant role of extracellular signal–
regulated protein kinases (erks) in controlling synaptic plasticity and memory formation. as a major synapse-to-nucleus
superhighway, erk transmits n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor signals to inducible transcriptional events essential for
nmda receptor– dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and
memory. this study investigated the role of the widely used
intravenous anesthetic propofol in regulating nmda receptor–
dependent erk phosphorylation.
methods: the possible effect of propofol on nmda receptor–
mediated erk phosphorylation was detected in cultured rat
hippocampal neurons with western blot analysis.
results: the authors found that propofol at clinical relevant
concentrations (1–10 ␮m) reduced nmda receptor–mediated
erk phosphorylation. this reduction was independent of
␥- xxxd2177xxx  transmission. the inhibition of the nmda
receptor seems to contribute to the effect of propofol on nmdastimulated erk phosphorylation, because propofol reduced
constitutive nmda receptor nr1 subunit phosphorylation and
impaired nmda receptor–mediated ca2ⴙ influx. furthermore,
by inhibiting the erk pathway, propofol blocked nmda receptor– dependent activation of two key transcription factors, elk-1
and cyclic  xxxd81xxx  response element– binding protein (creb), and, as a result, attenuated elk-1/creb–
dependent reporter gene (c-fos) expression.
conclusions: these results suggest that propofol possesses
the ability to inhibit nmda receptor activation of the erk pathway and subsequent transcriptional activities in hippocampal
neurons. these findings indicate a new avenue to explore a
transcription-dependent mechanism that may underlie anesthetic interference with synaptic plasticity related to amnesic
properties of intravenous anesthetics.

kinases 1 and 2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2)3 and has drawn considerable
attention because they are highly expressed in postmitotic neurons of the adult brain and are actively involved
in many types of intracellular activities and synaptic
plasticity.
 xxxg1369xxx /2 are activated via phosphorylation on thr(202)
and tyr(204) by diverse stimuli. once activated,  xxxg1369xxx /2
translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus to activate
specific transcription factors, leading to inducible gene
expression.2 l-glutamate is among neurotransmitters
that readily activate  xxxg1369xxx /2 in neurons (for a review, see
wang et al.4). activation of the ionotropic glutamate
receptor, the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar),
markedly increased basal levels of phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2
(perk1/2) proteins5–9 through a ca2⫹-dependent mechanism.7
an emerging role of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in controlling synaptic
plasticity and memory formation in the adult brain has
recently been established in several behavioral and cellular studies.10,11  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling seems to facilitate
transcriptional events and, as a result, to regulate distribution and functions of synaptic proteins to control
many forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term
potentiation (ltp) in the hippocampus,12,13 a cellular
model of learning and memory.14,15 in light of nmdardependent forms of ltp in the hippocampal ca1 region,
it has been shown that nmdar-gated ca2⫹ influx activates the erk pathway to increase the transcription of a
family of genes essential for the induction and/or maintenance of ltp.16 –19
propofol (2,6- xxxd3030xxx ) is a highly effective
intravenous anesthetic and is now widely used for general anesthesia and for sedation with local anesthesia and
in intensive care units.20,21 like other intravenous anesthetics, propofol produces amnesia in addition to sedation, hypnosis, and general anesthesia. the amnesic effect of propofol is believed to be related to its known
inhibition of ltp at schaffer collateral– commissural
pathway to ca1 pyramidal cell synapses in the hippocampus.22–24 however, cellular mechanisms underlying the propofol inhibition of hippocampal ltp are
poorly understood.
in this study, we therefore examined the effect of
propofol on the nmdar-dependent  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. we found
that propofol at clinical relevant concentrations (1–10
␮m) for producing clinical amnesia inhibited the
nmdar-mediated activation of the erk pathway as well

as the erk-sensitive activation of transcription factors
and gene expression. these findings create a novel avenue to investigate transcription-dependent mechanisms
for the amnesic property of propofol.

materials and methods
primary hippocampal neuronal cultures
standardized procedures preparing primary neuronal
cultures from embryonic day 17/18 (e17/e18) rats
(charles river, new york, ny) were used in this
study.9,25 time-mated pregnant rats were killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals. fetuses
were removed by cesarean section and transferred to a
sterile petri dish with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs). fetal hippocampi were dissected from surrounding brain tissue, and pooled tissue from each litter was
mechanically dissociated and plated on a poly-d-lysine–
coated 24-well plate at 200,000 –250,000 cells/well.
cells were cultured in a plating dmem/f12 medium
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1⫻ b27, 10 g/l glucose, 10 mg/l gentamicin, and
10 mg/l penicillin–streptomycin. after 24 h, the plating
medium was replaced by a fresh mixture of a maintenance medium composed by 30% dmem–f12 medium
and 70% neurobasal. approximately half of the medium
was replaced once a week, and 5 ␮m of 1-␤-d-arabinofuransylcytosine was added on day 4. cultures were
maintained for 9 –11 days and contained virtually pure
neurons. all procedures performed were approved by
the institutional animal care and use committee (kansas city, missouri) and were in accordance with the
national institutes of health guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals.26
western blot analysis
cell lysates from cultures were sonicated, protein concentrations were determined, and the equal amount of
protein (20 ␮g in 20 ␮l/lane) was loaded on nupage
novex 4 –12% gels (invitrogen) for separation of proteins. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (immobilon-p, 0.45 mm; millipore, bedford, ma) and blocked in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry
milk in pbs and 0.1% tween 20) for 1 h. the blots were
incubated in a primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against
perk1/2(thr(202)/tyr(204)) (cell signaling, beverly,
ma; 1:1,000),  xxxg1369xxx /2 (cell signaling; 1:1,000), cyclic

ser896 (upstate; 1:1,000), or ␤-actin (santa cruz biotechnology; 1:1,000) overnight at 4°c. this was followed by 1 h of incubation in goat anti-rabbit
horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary antibodies
(jackson immunoresearch laboratory, west grove, pa)
at 1:5,000. immunoblots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ecl; amersham
pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj), and captured into
kodak image station 2000r (rochester, ny). kaleidoscope-prestained standards (bio-rad, hercules, ca) were
used for protein size determination. the density of immunoblots was measured using the kodak 1d image
analysis software and were expressed as percentage of
control values.
intracellular ca2⫹ concentration measurements
intracellular ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]i) measurements were performed according to our previous procedures.27 briefly, the culture was loaded with hepesbuffered  xxxd2988xxx  aerated with 95% o2–5%
co2, ph 7.4, and contained 3 ␮m fura-2 am (sigma, st.
louis, mo). the fluorescence of fura-2 was sequentially
excited at 340 and 380 nm. emitted lights were collected
from the sample through a cooled, intensified chargecoupled device video camera (ic-110; photon technology international inc., lawrenceville, nj). the fluorescent signal was measured at a single neuronal cell.
baseline was recorded for 3–5 min before bath application of drugs. [ca2⫹]i was calculated from ratios of the
intensities of emitted fluorescence at two excitation
wavelengths (f340/f380) with northern eclipse image
software (empix imaging, inc., mississauga, ontario,
canada). when needed, fluorescence ratios (340/380)
were converted to an absolute [ca2⫹]i using the equation of [ca2⫹]i ⫽ kd(fmin/fmax)[(r ⫺ rmin)/(rmax ⫺ r)],
where kd is the dissociation constant for fura-2, f is the
emitted fluorescence from 380 nm excitation, and r is
the fluorescence ratio.27
cell viability assay
cell viability was measured using a double fluorescein
diacetate– xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining procedure.28 fluorescein diacetate is membrane permeable and freely enters intact cells, in which it is hydrolyzed by cytosolic
esterase and converted to membrane-impermeable fluorescein with a green fluorescence, exhibited only by live
cells.  xxxd3027xxx  iodide is nonpermeable to live cells, but
penetrates the membranes of dying or dead cells, showing red fluorescence. cells were rinsed twice with 1⫻
pbs and incubated at 37°c for 5 min with 1⫻ pbs (0.5
ml/well) containing 10 ␮g/ml fluorescein diacetate
(sigma) and 5 ␮g/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (sigma). cultures
were washed once with pbs and examined under fluorescent light microscopy. the total numbers of viable
cells stained by green fluorescein and dead cells stained
by red  xxxd3027xxx  iodide were determined by counting

cells in five random fields. positive control was produced
by treating cultures with kainic acid (500 –1,000 ␮m,
24 h).

drug treatment, the cells were quickly washed with ice-cold
pbs (ph 7.4, ca2⫹ free) and placed immediately on ice. the
cell monolayer was rapidly scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer.

drugs and drug treatments
propofol was purchased from sigma. n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda), (⫹)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (mk801), bicuculline, (2s)-3-[[(1s)1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl](phenylmethyl)phosphinic acid (cgp55845), and  xxxd3462xxx  were
purchased from tocris cookson inc. (ballwin, mo). all drugs
were freshly made on the day of experiment. drugs were
dissolved in 1⫻ pbs with or without an aid of dimethyl
sulfoxide (dmso). propofol was dissolved in dmso. the final
concentration of dmso was 0.1%, at which dmso itself had
no effect on basal (fig. 1a) and nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation. cultures were washed with pbs and preincubated at 37°c for 60 min in the humidified atmosphere of
5% co2 in hepes-buffered  xxxd2988xxx  (hbs) (154
mm nacl, 5.6 mm kcl, 2 mm cacl2, 2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 5.5 mm
glucose, and 20 mm hepes–koh or hepes–naoh, ph 7.4).
for nmda treatments,  xxxd2534xxx  was omitted from, and 1 ␮m of
glycine was added to, the hbs. a na⫹-free hbs was made by
iso-osmotically substituting n-methyl-d-glucamine for nacl,
and adjusting the ph to 7.2 with hcl. to have parameters
comparable, none of the hbss contained sodium bicarbonate.

at which 50% of the maximum effect is reached,
which was estimated by using nonlinear least-squares
regression techniques (graphpad prism version 4.0 for
windows; graphpad software, san diego, ca). probability levels of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

or  xxxg1369xxx /2 in immunoblot with protein extract from

immunoreactivity (data not shown). with the primary
antibodies in immunoblot, we found a single band in
a molecular weight predicted for the size of perk1
and perk2 (fig. 1a). similar results were observed for
 xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  (fig. 1a). these results demonstrated
the selectivity of perk1/2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 antibodies. in
addition, the effect of dmso on basal perk1/2 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 levels was examined. we found no significant
change in either perk1/2 or  xxxg1369xxx /2 protein levels
after incubation of dmso (2–5 min) at 0.1%, a final
concentration in cultures when it was used to dissolve
propofol (fig. 1a).
effects of propofol on basal  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation
we then tested whether propofol had any effect on
basal levels of perk1/2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in cultured rat
hippocampal neurons. propofol was added to cultures
and incubated for 5 min at a series of concentrations
(0.1, 1, 3, and 10 ␮m). these concentrations were selected based on the clinical relevant blood concentrations (approximately 3.5–3.7 ␮m) for producing 50% loss
of memory29,30 as compared with the clinical relevant
blood concentrations (approximately 5–28 ␮m) for maintaining general anesthesia.31 we found that propofol at
all concentrations surveyed did not alter basal levels of
either perk1/2 or  xxxg1369xxx /2 (figs. 1b–d). similar results as
to changes in perk1/2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 proteins were obtained when propofol was incubated at the same range
of concentrations for 1 or 15 min (data not shown).
propofol at all concentrations did not alter basal levels of
␤-actin (fig. 1b). in addition, there was no significant
difference in cell viability between control and propofoltreated cultures as detected by the double fluorescein
diacetate– xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining.
propofol inhibits nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation
activation of nmdars was able to increase  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation in cultured striatal neurons.5–7 similarly, nmda incubation (100 ␮m) for different durations
(1– 40 min) caused a rapid and transient increase in
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons (fig. 2a). a reliable increase in perk1/2 levels was
seen 1 min after propofol incubation. at 40 min, no
significant change in perk1/2 levels was induced by
nmda. throughout the time course tested, nmda did
not alter total levels of  xxxg1369xxx /2 proteins. therefore, the
elevated level of perk1/2 was due to an increased phosphorylation process of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in response to nmda
stimulation. in the presence of mk801, a noncompetitive open-channel blocker of nmdar channels, nmda
no longer induced a significant change in perk1/2 levels
(fig. 2a). therefore, the stimulatory effect of nmda on
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation relies on effective activation of
nmdar channels.
anesthesiology, v 105, no 6, dec 2006

1185

to determine whether propofol affects the nmdardependent  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, the ability of
nmda to elevate  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation was tested in
the presence of propofol. as shown in figure 2b, in the
presence of 0.1 ␮m of propofol, nmda still induced a
significant increase in basal levels of perk1/2, and this
increase was not statistically different from that observed after nmda treatment alone. in cultures pretreated with 1 ␮m of propofol, however, nmda did not
induce a significant increase in perk1/2 levels.  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m,
propofol completely prevented nmda from inducing an
increase in perk1/2. the ec50 values for propofol to
inhibit nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation were 1.1 and 1.0 ␮m, respectively. in all drug treatments,  xxxg1369xxx /2 remained with no change. these data
showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of
nmdar-regulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation.
the inhibitory effect of propofol is independent of
gaba transmission
propofol is a known allosteric potentiator and agonist
of ␥- xxxd2177xxx  type a (gabaa) receptors.32,33 in
the hippocampal ca1 region, propofol potentiated
gabaa receptor–mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.34 –36 to evaluate the possible contribution of
gabaergic transmission to the propofol action, the
propofol effect on nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation was tested in the presence of the gabaa receptor
antagonist bicuculline or the  xxxg828xxx  antagonist
cgp55845. we found that propofol (10 ␮m) blocked the
nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in cultures
pretreated with 20 ␮m bicuculline (fig. 3a). similarly,
propofol (10 ␮m) displayed the ability to block the
nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in the presence of the  xxxg828xxx  antagonist cgp55845 (1 ␮m;
fig. 3b). neither bicuculline nor cgp55845 had any
effect on basal perk1/2 and  xxxg1369xxx /2 levels (figs. 3a and
b). both antagonists did not seem to alter the  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation induced by nmda (figs. 3a and b).
furthermore, direct activation of the gaba receptor
with its ligand gaba (5 or 50 ␮m; 5 min) had no detectable effect on the nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation (data not shown). these results indicate that activation of gabaergic transmission after propofol
administration, if there is any, plays an insignificant role
in the propofol-sensitive inhibition of nmda actions.
propofol inhibits nmdar nr1 phosphorylation
and ca2⫹ influx
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor nr1 subunits undergo a
tight phosphorylation at distinct sites, serine 897 and
896, of their intracellular c-terminus under normal conditions.37 such serine phosphorylation represents a major posttranslational modification of this subunit and is
required for normal nmdar function as assayed in several experimental manipulations.38 – 41 to determine

increase in perk1/2 was rapid, transient, and sensitive to the nmdar antagonist mk801. nmda (100 ␮m) was added and incubated
for indicated durations. mk801 (2 ␮m) was incubated 30 min before and during a 5-min incubation with nmda (100 ␮m). (b) propofol
inhibited the nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. propofol at different concentrations

quantified data analyzed from separate experiments (mean ⴞ sem, n ⴝ 3– 6). * p < 0.05 versus basal levels. ⴙ p < 0.05 versus nmda

whether propofol affects nr1 phosphorylation at these
serine sites, effects of propofol exposure on basal levels
of nr1 subunits with phosphorylated serine 897 (pnr1ser897) or serine 896 (pnr1-ser896) were tested with a
phospho-site–specific antibody. we found that propofol
at 1–50 ␮m reduced basal levels of pnr1-ser897 (figs. 4a
and b). similar results were obtained for pnr1-ser896
(figs. 4a and b). however, propofol did not change basal
levels of nr1 proteins. propofol at 0.1 ␮m or 0.1% dmso
had no significant effect on pnr1-ser897 or pnr1ser896 (data not shown). to determine whether the
propofol effect was mediated through a gabaa receptor– dependent mechanism, the effect of propofol on
nr1 phosphorylation was tested in the presence of bicuculline. we found that in cultures pretreated with bicuculline (20 ␮m), propofol (10 ␮m) reduced basal levels of
anesthesiology, v 105, no 6, dec 2006

pnr1-ser897 and pnr1-ser896 to an extent comparable
to that produced by propofol in cultures without treatment with bicuculline (fig. 4c). therefore, the propofol
effect was independent of gabaa receptors. to determine whether propofol affects nmdar-mediated ca2⫹
influx, we tested effects of propofol on nmda-induced
ca2⫹ increase. a typical elevation of [ca2⫹]i was induced
after addition of nmda (50 –100 ␮m) into the culture as
detected by somatic fura-2 ratio fluorescent measurements (fig. 4d), which was blocked by mk801 (0.1 ␮m)
or removing extracellular ca2⫹ ions (data not shown),
confirming an nmdar-mediated ca2⫹ increase. in the
presence of propofol (10 ␮m), nmda (100 ␮m) was still
able to induce a significant increase of [ca2⫹]i as compared with basal levels (fig. 4d). however, the amplitude
of ca2⫹ increases was significantly smaller than that

propofol retained its ability to completely block the nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. bicuculline (20 ␮m) or cgp55845
(1 ␮m) was added 30 min before propofol (10 ␮m, 5 min), followed by a 5-min coincubation with nmda (100 ␮m). representative
immunoblots are shown above the quantified data analyzed from separate experiments (mean ⴞ sem, n ⴝ 3– 6). * p < 0.05 versus

observed in the absence of propofol (fig. 4d). the effect
of propofol at the two lower concentrations (1 and 3 ␮m)
on ca2⫹ responses to nmda (50 –100 ␮m, 20 s) was also
detected. we found that propofol at 3 ␮m significantly
reduced the amplitude of ca2⫹ responses (127.4 ⫾ 10.3
nm after nmda vs. 107.2 ⫾ 6.8 nm after propofol ⫹
nmda, n ⫽ 14; p ⬍ 0.05). propofol at 1 ␮m slightly
reduced the amplitude of ca2⫹ responses (129.6 ⫾ 9.5
nm after nmda vs. 118.4 ⫾ 10.3 nm after propofol ⫹
nmda, n ⫽ 13), which did not reach a statistically
significant level (p ⬎ 0.05). propofol itself had no effect
on basal levels of intracellular ca2⫹. these results indicate that propofol is capable of inhibiting nr1 phosphorylation and reducing nmdar-mediated ca2⫹ signals
in cultured hippocampal neurons.
propofol inhibits nmdar/erk-dependent
transcriptional activities
one of particularly noticeable roles that active erk
plays is to facilitate gene expression via phosphorylating

nuclear transcription factors.4 we then tested elk-15 and
creb, two specific factors downstream to the erk pathway, for their responses to nmda stimulation in the
presence of propofol. in addition, an immediate early
gene, c-fos, was tested as a reporter of inducible gene
expression downstream to elk-1 and creb to determine
a final output of gene expression. we found that the
nmda-stimulated phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 (fig. 5a),
elk-1 (fig. 5b), and creb (fig. 5c) and c-fos expression
(fig. 5d) were blocked by a mapk kinase–selective inhibitor,  xxxd3462xxx  (5 ␮m), confirming the role of the erk
pathway in mediating nmda-stimulated elk-1 and creb
phosphorylation and c-fos expression. interestingly, like
 xxxd3462xxx , propofol (10 ␮m) substantially reduced elk-1 (fig.
5b) and creb (fig. 5c) phosphorylation and c-fos expression (fig. 5b) induced by nmda stimulation. no
significant differences were found in total  xxxg1369xxx /2, elk-1,
creb, and ␤-actin proteins after any drug treatments (fig.
5). these results suggest that propofol can reduce the
nmda-stimulated phosphorylation of elk-1 and creb

discussion
this study investigated a hypothesis that propofol inhibits the nmdar-mediated activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2
pathway in cultured rat hippocampal ca1 neurons. we
found that propofol at the clinical relevant concentrations blocked the nmdar-mediated activation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2. propofol also attenuated the nmda-stimulated
phosphorylation of transcription factors, creb and
elk-1, two downstream targets to the  xxxg1369xxx /2 pathway,
and a reporter gene expression (c-fos). in the presence
of the gabaa or  xxxg828xxx  antagonist, propofol
preserved its potency in inhibiting the nmdar-mediated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, indicating a gaba-independent mechanism mediating the effect of propofol. because propofol inhibited serine phosphorylation of
nmdar nr1 subunits and nmdar-mediated ca2⫹ influx, the inhibition of nmdar-mediated ca2⫹ influx may
partially account for the inhibition of nmda-stimulated
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. the results obtained here suggest that propofol possesses the ability to produce the
potent inhibition of nmdar-mediated erk activation
and erk-mediated gene expression.
propofol has been well documented as an allosteric
anesthesiology, v 105, no 6, dec 2006

potentiator and agonist of gabaa receptors.32,33 by enhancing gabaergic transmission, propofol produces its
anesthetic effect. because propofol potentiated gabaa
receptor–mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in
the hippocampal ca1 region,34 –36 it is possible that this
agent may inhibit the nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation through a gabaergic mechanism. however,
results from this study seem to disagree with this notion.
pharmacologic blockade of gabaa or gabab receptors
did not affect the propofol inhibition of nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. direct stimulation of
gaba receptors with gaba did not inhibit the nmdarmediated  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation.
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors regulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation via a ca2⫹-sensitive mechanism. the
nmdar-mediated ca2⫹ influx activates the ca2⫹-sensitive protein kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ca2⫹/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, to
increase  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation.7 in this study, propofol at 3 and 10 ␮m was found to decrease nmda-stimulated ca2⫹ influx. therefore, at these two concentrations, propofol may inhibit the  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation
through a ca2⫹-dependent mechanism. in contrast,
propofol at 1 ␮m did not significantly affect nmdastimulated ca2⫹ influx, whereas it was effective to inhibit the  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. therefore, at this low
concentration, propofol may reduce the  xxxg1369xxx /2 phos-

phorylation through an unclear and likely ca2⫹-independent mechanism. in support of this, nmdars have been
found to increase  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation via a prime
synaptic protein,  xxxg642xxx , in a ca2⫹-independent manner.9 nevertheless, at all concentrations surveyed (1, 3,
and 10 ␮m), propofol showed the ability to inhibit
nmdar phosphorylation at the two nr1 serine sites
(serine 897 and 896). this may cause inhibition of
nmdar function in activating either the ca2⫹-dependent or -independent signaling pathway, leading to reduction of nmda-stimulated  xxxg1369xxx /2 responses. phosphorylation of nr1 at these serine sites has been thought
anesthesiology, v 105, no 6, dec 2006

to be a major posttranslational modification of this subunit, and the state of nr1 serine phosphorylation is
positively correlated to enhanced nmdar function in
several experimental manipulations.38 – 41 in our previous work conducted in cultured striatal neurons, we
found that propofol at 1–10 ␮m can cause a rapid decrease in nr1 phosphorylation at the two serine sites.42
in this study, we observed the same inhibitory effect of
propofol on nr1 serine phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons. therefore, the propofol action in suppressing nr1 phosphorylation is not cell-type specific.

fig. 6. schematic illustration of propofol inhibition of long-term
potentiation (ltp) through inhibiting n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar)– dependent activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinases (mapk)/extracellular signal–regulated protein
kinases 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2). sequential events underlying the
nmdar/erk-dependent ltp are initiated with an increase in
ca2ⴙ influx through activated nmdar channels. ca2ⴙ signals
then activate the ras–erk cascade, probably through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) and ca2ⴙ/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinases (camks). active  xxxg1369xxx /2 proteins translocate
into the nucleus to activate their transcription factor targets,
cyclic  xxxd81xxx  response element– binding
protein (creb) and elk-1, leading to the facilitation of inducible
gene expression implicated in the maintenance of long-lasting
ltp. propofol inhibits nmdars and thus blocks the nmdarmediated activation of the erk pathway and impairs the
nmdar/erk-dependent ltp. the inhibitory effect of propofol
may result from its inhibition of phosphorylation of nmdar
nr1 subunits at serine residues 897 and 896. cre ⴝ cyclic

dergo active tyrosine phosphorylation which has the
profound effect on nmdar function (for a review, see
wang et al. 43). it remains to be investigated whether
propofol can affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the
nmdar to alter its function.
grasshoff and gillessen44 have found that propofol at
10 but not 1 ␮m reduced nmda-stimulated ca2⫹ influx,
which is consistent with the observations in this study.
however, at 3 ␮m, they found that propofol did not
significantly alter nmda-stimulated ca2⫹ responses, in
contrast to a statistically significant reduction of the
ca2⫹ responses observed in this study. this slight difference in the degree of inhibition of nmda-stimulated
ca2⫹ influx observed at 3 ␮m of propofol between this
study and that conducted by grasshoff and gillessen may
reflect differences in cultures (cortical cultures in their
studies vs. hippocampal cultures in this study), application of nmda (300 ␮m for 180 s in their studies vs.
50 –100 ␮m for 20 s in this study), and other culturing
conditions.

long-term potentiation is an activity-dependent event
reflecting enhancement of synaptic efficacy. in the hippocampal ca1 region, ltp can last for hours and requires de novo transcription and protein synthesis.14,17
like ltp, various forms of learning behaviors, especially
at the late phase of learning, are messenger rna– and
protein synthesis– dependent.45– 47 in exploring signaling mechanisms mediating inducible gene expression
needed for ltp, increasing evidence indicates that the
erk pathway plays a pivotal role. the erk pathway is a
major synapse-to-nucleus superhighway mediating new
gene expression in response to a variety of cellular
stimuli.2 recent reports show that the induction, maintenance, or both of nmdar-dependent ltp require activation of this pathway. for example, nmdar-dependent ltp in ca1 area was associated with an increase in
active  xxxg1369xxx /2.48 the inhibitors selective for the erk
pathway blocked nmdar-dependent ltp.16,49,50 like
the inhibitors for the erk pathway, propofol blocked
nmdar-dependent ltp in the hippocampal ca1 region.23,24 likely through its inhibition of nmdar-dependent ltp, propofol induces amnesia, and its suppression
of memory function can persist for several hours after
propofol administration.51 in this study, we demonstrated that propofol inhibited nmdar-dependent activation of the erk pathway in hippocampal ca1 neurons. although the current study conducted no
electrophysiologic and behavioral experiments to define
the role of the inhibited erk phosphorylation by propofol in regulating nmdar-dependent ltp and memory
behaviors, our findings here seem to add a piece of
evidence for a possible transcription-dependent mechanism responsible for the propofol inhibition of nmdardependent ltp and for the amnesic effect of propofol.
the erk pathway transmits  xxxg981xxx  signals
to elk-1 and creb for the facilitation of gene expression.7,52,53 the elk-1– and creb–facilitated gene expression is implicated in the development and maintenance
of ltp and learning and memory.11,17,50 it is then intriguing to investigate whether propofol that inhibits the
nmdar/erk pathway could inhibit nmdar/erk-dependent elk-1 and creb phosphorylation. we found that
propofol at concentrations that blocked nmdar-dependent activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 attenuated increases in elk-1
and creb phosphorylation and c-fos expression (fig. 6).
therefore, propofol possesses the ability to suppress
elk-1– and creb–sensitive gene expression likely
through the inhibition of nmdar-dependent activation
of the erk pathway. this suppression of elk-1– and
creb–sensitive gene expression may contribute to the
inhibition of transcriptionally dependent ltp.
