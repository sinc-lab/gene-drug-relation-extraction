abstract
the anti-apoptotic molecule, bcl-2, is well known to play an
important role in the chemoresistance of breast cancer. we
have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of fasassociated death domain-containing protein ( xxxg756xxx ) at 194
serine through c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk) activation
sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy through accelerating cell cycle arrest at g2/m, and that bcl-2 phosphorylation downstream of jnk/ xxxg756xxx  plays an important role in
cell growth suppression by paclitaxel. in this study, the clinicopathological association of phosphorylated bcl-2 (p-bcl-2)
with estrogen, progesterone, c- xxxg682xxx -2 receptors, p53 expressions and phosphorylated  xxxg756xxx /jnk (p- xxxg756xxx /jnk) was
analyzed immunohistochemically using 107 human breast
cancer specimens. expression of p-bcl-2 was found to significantly correlate with lymphatic invasion, lymph node
metastasis, but not histological differentiation, tumor grade
or vascular and fatty invasion. the positivity of p-bcl-2 was
also significantly correlated to that of p- xxxg756xxx /jnk. thus, pbcl-2 as well as the p- xxxg756xxx /jnk parameter might be useful
markers for cancer progression, independent of the  xxxg1603xxx  status, in human breast cancers.

introduction

bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 family,
plays an important role in resistance to cytotoxicity induced by anticancer drugs and  xxxg1603xxx  antagonists in various types of cancer [1–3]. it has also been
found to be a useful marker of good prognosis [4, 5], correlating with low or absent expression of p53 [6, 7]. however, immunohistochemical studies regarding the significance of bcl-2 expression have generated conflicting
findings. bcl-2 phosphorylation is induced by paclitaxel,
one of the chemotherapeutic drugs frequently used for
breast cancer, and is required for apoptosis [8, 9] and cell
cycle arrest [10, 11]. indeed, there is evidence that paclitaxel inhibits the anti-apoptotic functions of bcl-2
through its phosphorylation [12]. however, others have
reported that increased phosphorylated bcl-2 due to a decrease in the dephosphorylated form is directly linked to
apoptosis resistance [13, 14]. in the present study, we
therefore focused on the effects of a form of bcl-2 phosphorylated at ser70 (p-bcl-2) on pathological parameters.
c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk) is a member of the
serine/threonine family of protein kinases which is induced by cellular stress due to ultraviolet (uv) light, irradiation and cytotoxic drugs [15]. jnk activation plays
an important role in the induction of cell cycle arrest or
cell death by cytotoxic reagents: paclitaxel activates jnk,

resulting in g2/m cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cell
lines [16]. furthermore, shimada et al. [17] demonstrated
that jnk activation-dependent phosphorylation of bcl-2
is essential for apoptosis induced by 2- xxxd3206xxx .
fas-associated death domain-containing protein ( xxxg756xxx )
phosphorylation at ser194 (p- xxxg756xxx ) can also be induced
by paclitaxel, which impacts both upstream and downstream of the mekk1/mkk7/ xxxg1370xxx  pathway and is
closely associated with sensitization to chemotherapy in
prostate cancer cells [18, 19].  xxxg756xxx  was originally identified as an adapter molecule generating a death-inducing
signaling complex required for fas-mediated apoptosis
[20, 21], and involvement of  xxxg756xxx  phosphorylation in
cell cycle arrest has been indicated in breast epithelial or
tumor cells [22, 23].
in the light of these findings, the correlations between
the expression of phosphorylated bcl-2 and clinicopathological parameters such as lymph node metastasis,  xxxg1603xxx /p53/c-erbb2 status and phosphorylation
of jnk/ xxxg756xxx  were assessed for the first time by immunohistochemistry using human breast cancer specimens.

routinely fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin,
cut at 4 m, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin
(he).
immunohistochemical staining
tumor sections were de-paraffinized, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked by immersing the slides in a 3% hydrogen
peroxidase in methanol for 20 min. the slides were then incubated in 10 mm citrate buffer solution (ph 6.0) in a pressure cooker for 10 min at 120 ° c and cooled for 1 h. binding of antibodies
(table 1) was detected by the avidin-biotin complex technique using a histofine sab-po kit (nichirei, tokyo, japan). slides were
rinsed with pbs and nonspecific binding was blocked with 10%
goat normal serum (histofine kit) before incubation with specific antibodies and reaction products were visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (dab). to aid orientation,
the slides were finally counterstained with mayer’s hematoxylin.
levels of phosphorylated forms of bcl-2, jnk and  xxxg756xxx  were
calculated as the percentages of positive primary cancer cells in
relation to the total numbers in representative fields. nuclear
staining in 110% of cells was the criterion for p-jnk and p- xxxg756xxx 
positivity, and cytoplasmic staining in 150 and 110% for p-bcl-2
and bcl-2, respectively [24]. similarly, nuclear or cytoplasmic
staining in 110% was estimated to be positive for estrogen and
progesterone receptors and for p53 [25] expression. only the
membrane staining intensity and pattern were evaluated with the
hercep test kit scoring guidelines for the c- xxxg682xxx -2 receptor. mcf7 cells were stained immunohistochemically using bcl-2 and pbcl-2 antibodies with or without 0.1 nm paclitaxel stimulation, as
positive and negative controls.

statistical analyses
statistical analyses were performed using statview 5.0 software (sas institute inc.). the student’s t test was employed to
detect differences in expression of p-bcl-2 in cases positive or negative for lymph node metastases. a post-hoc test (tukey-kramer)
and spearman’s correlation test were carried out to analyze the
relations between p-bcl-2 and p-jnk, and p-bcl-2 and p- xxxg756xxx 
expression. p values of ! 0.05 were considered statistically significant. all p values were two-sided.

tumor specimens
a total of 107 tumor samples were obtained at surgical resection from breast cancer patients in nissei hospital, osaka, and
nara city hospital, nara, japan, between 1987 and 2002. informed consent was obtained from the patients before the collection of specimens. neither chemotherapy nor radiation
therapy was performed before surgery in any of the cases. histopathological diagnosis was made using the who histological
classification for tumors of the breast and histological grade
was evaluated by the elston and ellis method. specimens were

discussion

clinicopathological significance of bcl-2 and its
phosphorylated form
table 3 summarizes the data for relationships between
p-bcl-2 and clinicopathological factors. the expression
of phosphorylated bcl-2 was statistically associated with
p53 expression, but not with other clinicopathological
factors, except negatively with lymph node metastases.

this is the first report showing that levels of phosphorylated bcl-2 are inversely correlated with lymph
node metastases in human breast cancers. bcl-2 has a
loop domain including serine phosphorylation sites that
change its anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic functions [27,
28] and serine-70 is critical in this regard [11]. deletion
of the loop region of bcl-2 completely blocks apoptosis by

expression of phosphorylated bcl-2
the clinicopathological characteristics of patients
with breast cancer used in the current study are summarized in table 2. phosphorylation of  xxxg756xxx  at 194 serine
through jnk activation has recently been demonstrated
to be closely associated with invasion activity, and bcl-2
phosphorylation is downstream from phosphorylated
jnk/ xxxg756xxx  essential for cell growth arrest in human
breast cancer cell lines [26]. total expression of jnk or
 xxxg756xxx  was similar in primary cancer cells without (fig. 1a
jnk, fig. 1c  xxxg756xxx ) or with lymph node metastasis (fig. 1e
jnk, fig. 1g  xxxg756xxx ) but the phosphorylated forms of both
were significantly reduced in the cases positive for lymph
node metastases (fig. 1f p-jnk, fig. 1h p- xxxg756xxx ; the lowest panels of table 3). as shown in figure 2, bcl-2 was expressed in primary cancer without (fig. 2a) or with
(fig. 2c) lymph node metastases to the same extent, but
the phosphorylated form was reduced in those with metastases (fig. 2d, 3a). expression of p-bcl-2 was also inversely correlated with lymphatic invasion of primary
specimens (fig. 3b), but not histological classification, tumor grade, or vascular and fatty invasion (data not
shown). of interest, positivity for phosphorylated bcl-2
was statistically related to that for phosphorylated jnk
and  xxxg756xxx : when 107 stained specimens were classified
into 4 categories dependent on the p-bcl-2-positive percentage and the positivity for p-jnk or p- xxxg756xxx , significant associations with bcl-2 phosphorylation were evident using the post-hoc test and spearman’s correlation
test (fig. 3c, d). in addition, we have evaluated the synergism for phosphorylated forms of bcl-2,  xxxg756xxx  and jnk
using the double-staining technique in three combinations (for example, the first antibody is anti-p-bcl-2 and
the second antibody is anti-p- xxxg756xxx ). cancer cells were
highly positive for p- xxxg756xxx , p-bcl-2 and p-jnk to the
same extent without lymph node metastases, but negative
in those with metastases (data not shown). from these
results, there might be a close association between phosphorylation of bcl-2,  xxxg756xxx  and jnk in breast cancer
cells.

taxanes [12]. unlike unphosphorylated bcl-2, the phosphorylated form appears to be associated with the cytotoxic effects on cancer cells and the present study indicated a link with cancer progression, especially lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastases. we have
previously demonstrated bcl-2 phosphorylation to be
downstream of  xxxg756xxx  phosphorylation at 194 serine
through jnk activation and to play an important role in
cancer proliferation and invasion [26]. the earlier studies
were mainly in vitro and therefore the present focus was
on bcl-2 phosphorylation and upstream jnk/ xxxg756xxx  signals in actual tumors. the clear result was that jnk,

 xxxg756xxx  and bcl-2 are more phosphorylated in breast cancer cells without lymph node metastases rather than in
those with metastases, phosphorylation of bcl-2 significantly correlating with that of jnk and  xxxg756xxx  in human
breast cancers.
our findings suggest that bcl-2 phosphorylation has a
negative effect through jnk/ xxxg756xxx  signals, and are supported by recent data from kondo et al. [29] who reported that loss of pser70 bcl-2 expression, demonstrated immunohistochemically, was associated with lymph node

metastasis in colorectal cancer. the detailed mechanisms
by which downregulation of dephosphorylated bcl-2
and/or upregulation of the phosphorylated form might
influence cancer progression are still unclear, but the fact
that jnk/ xxxg756xxx  phosphorylation has critical effects on
the bcl-2 status and metastasis of breast cancers might
contribute to an explanation. activation or expression of
map kinase jnk and c- xxxg682xxx -2 receptor are well documented to be closely related to tamoxifen (anti-estrogen)
resistance or tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in human

breast cancer cells [30–33]. however, in the current study,
expression of phosphorylated jnk,  xxxg756xxx  or bcl-2 revealed no relation to the  xxxg1603xxx  status (table 3). it is generally accepted that a positive finding for
p53 indicates accumulation of mutated p53 with loss of
function, therefore, increased p53 immunostaining implies higher malignant potential in human breast cancer
[34, 35]. although the p53 antibody used in our study
binds to both the wild and mutant type, the expression is
not correlated to any other clinicopathological factors,
but proportionally associated with the p-bcl-2 level. taken together, we speculate that phosphorylated bcl-2 could
be upregulated in response to increased p53 and suppress
tumor development, and that positive findings for p53
cannot always be linked to poor outcome in human breast
cancer, although the frequencies and locations of the p53
mutation should be investigated in detail.

used for breast cancer therapy. the cytotoxic mechanisms have been well studied, including bcl-2 phosphorylation: for example, d-24851 (a recently developed microtubule inhibitor) induces g2/m cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis through bcl-2 phosphorylation in a p53-independent manner [37] and paclitaxel can induce bcl-2
phosphorylation and disturb bax/bcl-2 heterodimerization, resulting in g2/m cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
[28]. map kinase activation through jnk and the dependent  xxxg756xxx /bcl-2 phosphorylation also appear to be involved in paclitaxel-induced cell growth suppression [19,
26]. the tissue samples used in the present study were all
derived from patients without chemoradiation therapy
prior to surgical resection. the incidence of p-bcl-2 expression was very high (86/107; table 3), but that of the
upstream molecule (p-jnk or p- xxxg756xxx ) was much lower
(25/107 and 49/107). we expect that paclitaxel treatment
can mediate not only bcl-2 phosphorylation but also activation of the upstream signals, resulting in clinical benmatsuyoshi/shimada/nakamura/ishida/

efits for patients. taking the available information together, we propose that bcl-2 phosphorylation-mediated
suppression of cancer progression in relation to p53 might
be a key mechanisms in paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity.
in summary, phosphorylated bcl-2 in combination
with upstream jnk/ xxxg756xxx  phosphorylation may suppress cancer progression, and is a useful marker for lymph
node metastases and chemosensitivity in human breast
cancers (fig. 4).
