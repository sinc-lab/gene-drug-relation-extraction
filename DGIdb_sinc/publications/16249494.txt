purpose. this study was designed to clarify the involvement of
the  xxxg1878xxx  in the intraocular pressure (iop)lowering effects of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and
unoprostone with the use of fp-receptor– deficient (fpko)
mice.
methods. fpko and wild-type (wt) mice were bred and acclimatized under a 12-hour light– dark cycle. iop was measured
under general anesthesia by a microneedle method. to evaluate the effects of each drug, a single drop (3 ␮l) of each drug
solution was topically applied in a masked manner to a randomly selected eye. iop reduction was evaluated by the difference in iop between the treated eye and the untreated contralateral eye in the same mouse. first, the diurnal variation and
baseline iop in wt and fpko mice were measured. then, to
determine the window feasible for demonstrating the most
marked ocular hypotensive effect, 0.005%  xxxd2446xxx  was applied to wt mice during the day or at night. the time when the
ocular hypotensive effect was larger was selected for further
studies to evaluate the effects of  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%),  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%),  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%), and unoprostone
(0.12%). in addition, bunazosin (0.1%) was also applied to
demonstrate functional uveoscleral outflow in fpko mice. all
experiments were conducted under a masked study design.
results. the baseline iop (mean ⫾ sem) in wt and fpko
mice was 15.0 ⫾ 0.2 and 15.0 ⫾ 0.3 mm hg, respectively,
during the day, and 18.9 ⫾ 0.4 and 19.2 ⫾ 0.4 mm hg,
respectively, at night. in wt mice,  xxxd2446xxx  significantly
lowered iop both during the day and at night, at 2 to 6 hours
and 1 to 6 hours after application, respectively. maximal iop
reduction was observed at 3 hours after drug instillation both
during the day (10.9 ⫾ 1.8%) and at night (23.2 ⫾ 1.1%). at 3
hours after instillation,  xxxd2446xxx  (10.9 ⫾ 1.8% and 23.2 ⫾
1.1%, daytime and nighttime, respectively),  xxxd3414xxx  (15.9 ⫾
1.4% and 26.1 ⫾ 1.2%) and  xxxd340xxx  (8.8 ⫾ 2.0 and 19.8 ⫾
1.5%) significantly lowered iop in wt mice both during the
day and at night; isopropyl unoprostone significantly lowered
iop at night (13.7 ⫾ 1.9%) but not during the day (5.3 ⫾ 3.2%).
in fpko mice,  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone showed no significant iop-lowering effect. bunazosin
significantly lowered iop in both wt (22.1 ⫾ 1.6%) and fpko
mice (22.2 ⫾ 2.1%).

conclusions. a single application of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,
 xxxd340xxx , or unoprostone had no effect on iop in fpko
mice with presumed functional uveoscleral outflow pathways.
the  xxxg1878xxx  plays a crucial role in the mechanism of early iop lowering of all commercially available prostaglandin analogues. (invest ophthalmol vis sci. 2005;46:
4159 – 4163) doi:10.1167/iovs.05-0494

p

rostaglandin (pg) analogues have been widely used as
ocular hypotensive drugs for the treatment of glaucoma
and ocular hypertension, because of both a greater effect in
lowering intraocular pressure (iop) and fewer systemic side
effects than ␤-blockers. currently, four different types of pg
analogues,  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and isopropyl
unoprostone (unoprostone), are used for the treatment of
glaucoma.  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx  are thought to lower
iop mainly via the  xxxg1878xxx  because of their high degree of
specificity to this receptor.1 this is supported by a recent
report that  xxxd2446xxx  showed no iop-lowering effect in fpreceptor– deficient (fpko) mice.2 on the other hand, the ioplowering mechanisms of  xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone are not
fully understood.
 xxxd340xxx , which has the structure of a  xxxd340xxx , was
originally reported not to act as a pg analogue because of not
binding to all prostanoid receptors.3 so far, no specific receptor for  xxxd340xxx  has been determined. however, its metabolite,  xxxd340xxx  free acid, binds to the  xxxg1878xxx  with a
potency similar to that of  xxxd2446xxx .1,4 –11 recently,  xxxd340xxx  has been shown to be readily hydrolyzed to the free acid
in human eyes12 (dahlin dc. iovs 2004;45:arvo e-abstract
2096). in addition,  xxxd340xxx  itself has a weak affinity to fp,
leading to increased intracellular calcium concentration.7
thus,  xxxd340xxx  may exert fp agonistic activity.
unoprostone shows low affinities for all prostanoid receptors.1 however, there are several hypotheses to explain unoprostone-induced iop reduction. unoprostone free acid and
further metabolites have been reported to stimulate pge2 release, which may play a role in iop reduction by unoprostone.13,14 unoprostone free acid activates maxi-k channels to
inhibit trabecular meshwork contraction, which can lead to
increases in aqueous outflow.15 finally, unoprostone can induce cellular responses similar to those induced by other fp
agonists in cultured ciliary muscle cells and trabecular meshwork cells, probably by acting as a weak fp agonist.1,5,7,8
the discrepancies in many reports may be due to the
limitations of the results generated by pharmacological in vitro
experiments. for this reason, the transgenic mouse is a powerful tool for investigating single-gene-related function in vivo.
in an attempt to shed light on the iop-lowering mechanism of
 xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone and to confirm the fp-receptor–
mediated action of  xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd3414xxx , we examined
the effects of four commercially available pg analogues,  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone, on iop in
prostanoid fp-receptor– deficient mice. in addition, the response to bunazosin hcl, which has been reported to decrease
iop by increasing uveoscleral outflow,16,17 was measured to
establish the presence of functional uveoscleral outflow pathways in fpko mice.

methods

animals
all experiments were performed in compliance with the arvo statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. fpko
mice were generated by homologous recombination with a target
vector that replaces the second exon of the fp gene with the ␤-galactosidase- and neomycin-resistant gene. homozygous knockout mice do
not transcribe fp-receptor mrna.18 both homozygous and heterozygous knockout mice develop normally, and have no gross abnormalities in behavior, macro- or microscopic anatomy, or biochemical or
hematologic indices.18 because homozygote knockout females fail to
initiate parturition, heterozygous (female) and homozygous (male)
mating pairs were used to generate an f1 generation. murine genotype
was determined by pcr,2 and fp-receptor homozygous knockout mice
were used. c57bl/6 mice, which constitute the background species of
the fpko mice, were used as the wild-type (wt) control. mice were
bred and housed in clear cages, loosely covered with air filters, and
white chips provided bedding. the environment was kept at 21°c with
a 12-hour light (6 am to 6 pm) and 12-hour dark cycle. all mice were
fed ad libitum and acclimatized to the environment for at least 2 weeks
before the experiments. we used mice older than 8 weeks of age in our
study.

preparation and instillation of
ophthalmic solution
 xxxd2446xxx  and  xxxd340xxx  were purchased from cayman chemical
co. (ann arbor, mi).  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%) was dissolved in its vehicle
solution as reported previously.19  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%) was dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%), unoprostone
(0.12%), and bunazosin hcl (0.1%) ophthalmic solutions, and the
vehicle solution for each, were provided by alcon inc. (fort worth,
tx), r-tech ueno ltd. (hyogo, japan), and santen pharmaceutical
(osaka, japan), respectively. with a micropipette, 3 ␮l of each drug
solution was topically applied in a masked manner to a randomly
selected eye, and the contralateral, untreated eye served as the control.

iop measurement
iop was measured by a microneedle method in mice anesthetized with
ketamine and xylazine, as described previously.20 briefly, a borosilicate
glass microneedle (100-␮m tip diameter and 1.0-mm outer diameter;
world precision instruments [wpi], sarasota, fl) was connected to a
pressure transducer (model blpr; wpi). the system pressure detected
by the transducer was recorded by a data acquisition and analysis
system (powerlab; adinstruments, colorado springs, co). the microneedle was placed in the anterior chamber, and the conducted
pressure was recorded in both eyes during a 4- to 7-minute time
window after anesthesia. until the mouse was placed on the table for
iop measurement, room lighting was maintained similarly to that in
the vivaria. for dark-phase measurements, all procedures were performed under red light illumination to eliminate the effect of lighting
on iop. the effect of each drug was calculated as the ratio of iop
reduction (%), defined as 100 ⫻ (iop of treated eye ⫺ iop of contralateral eye)/iop of contralateral eye in each mouse.

diurnal variation of iop in wt and fpko mice
diurnal iop variation in wt and fpko mice was measured during the
day (9 am) and at night (9 pm) by a microneedle method in mice under
general anesthesia. the time points for iop measurement were chosen
in accordance with previous reports.20,21 trough and peak iop under
the 12-hour light– dark cycle was observed at 9 am and at 9 pm in nih
swiss and ddy mice.

time-course effect of  xxxd2446xxx  on iop
in wt mice

hypotensive effect of pg analogues, we evaluated the time course of

 xxxd2446xxx  on iop in wt mice. three microliters of 0.005%  xxxd2446xxx  was applied to one randomly selected eye of an animal at 6 am
or 6 pm, and the iop-lowering effect of  xxxd2446xxx  was measured at 1,
2, 3, and 6 hours after drug instillation, as previously reported.21 the
time point at which the ocular hypotensive effect was greatest was
used for further studies to evaluate the effects of pg analogues.

effect of vehicle solutions on iop in wt and
fpko mice
to confirm that the vehicle solutions did not affect iop, 3 ␮l vehicle
solution for each pg analogue and bunazosin was administrated topically to one randomly chosen eye in both wt and fpko mice at 6 am
or 6 pm. three investigators instilled eye drops under blinded test
protocols. a fourth investigator, also masked to the treatment, measured iop 3 hours after drug instillation, as described above. thus, all
measurements were performed under masked conditions.

iop-lowering effects of pg analogues on wt and
fpko mice during the day and at night
three microliters of  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%),  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%),  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%), or isopropyl unoprostone (0.12%) was administrated
topically to one randomly chosen eye in both wt and fpko mice at 6
am or 6 pm. three investigators instilled eye drops under blinded test
protocols. a fourth investigator, also masked to the treatment, measured iop 3 hours after drug instillation, as described above. thus, all
measurements were performed under masked conditions.

iop-lowering effect of bunazosin hcl on wt and
fpko mice at night
three microliters of bunazosin hcl (bunazosin; 0.1%) was topically
applied to one randomly chosen eye in both wt and fpko mice at 6
pm. the instillation and iop measurement were performed under the
masked conditions described above. at 3 hours after drug instillation,
iop was measured as described above.

statistical analysis
the mann–whitney u test was used for comparison of baseline iop
between daytime and nighttime values in each strain and also for
comparison of iop reduction between wt and fpko mice. the wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used for comparison of iop between the
treated eye and the contralateral eye. the kruskal-wallis test was used
for multiple comparisons of iop. values of p ⬍ 0.05 were considered
significant. all data are presented as means ⫾ sem.

effect of  xxxd2446xxx  on iop in wt mice during
the day and at night
to confirm the effect of  xxxd2446xxx  on iop in wt mice and to
determine the best time point for comparison of pg-analogue
hypotensive effects, we examined the iop-lowering effect of
 xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%) at 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after drug instillation at 6 am (daytime) and at 6 pm (nighttime) (fig. 1). after
drug application at 6 am, a significant elevation in iop (8.9 ⫾

during the day,  xxxd2446xxx  (10.9 ⫾ 1.8%, p ⫽ 0.0117),  xxxd3414xxx  (15.9 ⫾ 1.4%, p ⫽ 0.0180), and  xxxd340xxx  (8.7 ⫾
2.0%, p ⫽ 0.0180) significantly lowered iop in wt mice (fig.

mice (fig. 3a). at night,  xxxd2446xxx  (23.2 ⫾ 1.1%, p ⫽ 0.0033),
 xxxd3414xxx  (26.1 ⫾ 1.2%, p ⫽ 0.0051),  xxxd340xxx  (19.8 ⫾

significantly lowered iop in wt mice (fig. 2b), whereas they
had no significant effect on iop in fpko mice (fig. 3b). in wt
mice, the iop-lowering effect of each pg analogue was greater
at night than during the day (figs. 2a and b); conversely, in
fpko mice, the iop-lowering effects of pg analogues did not
differ significantly between daytime and nighttime administration (figs. 3a and b).

effect of bunazosin hcl on iop in wt and fpko

bunazosin significantly lowered iop at 3 hours after instillation
in both wt (22.1 ⫾ 1.6%, p ⫽ 0.0033) and fpko mice (22.2 ⫾

difference in the magnitude of iop reduction between wt and
fpko mice (p ⫽ 0.7782).

discussion
in this study, we examined the effects of pg analogues on iop
in fpko mice. in the absence of the  xxxg1878xxx ,
the iop-lowering effects of a single instillation of pg analogues
including  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and unoprostone were completely eliminated. on the other hand, bunazosin, which lowers iop by improving uveoscleral outflow,16,17
lowered iop in fpko mice. thus, fpko mice do not likely
have functional abnormalities in uveoscleral outflow. these
results suggest that the  xxxg1878xxx  plays a crucial
role in the early iop-lowering mechanism of all commercially
available pg analogues. however, the intracellular signaling
pathway and cellular response to fp-receptor binding have not

been fully clarified. especially with regard to the short-term
effect, there must be some cellular responses different from
the induction of matrix metalloproteinase and the subsequent
remodeling of extracellular matrices, which occur over a long
time span.22,23
our results confirm those of a previous study in which
 xxxd2446xxx  failed to induce an iop-lowering effect in fpko
and fp-receptor heterogeneous knockout mice; these mice had
no obvious anatomic differences compared to wt mice.2 in
the previous study, however, iop was measured during the day
(between 2 and 6 pm), when iop in the wt mice was not high
(13.9 –14.6 mm hg), likely due to the 24-hour variation in iop.
thus, the measured iop reduction induced by  xxxd2446xxx  in
the wt mice was small (⫺1.4 mm hg) and not necessarily
adequate for comparison with that in the fpko mice. moreover, only the structural similarity in the uveoscleral outflow
pathway between fpko and wt mice was histologically examined. in light of these previous results, the baseline iop and
the response to  xxxd2446xxx  were measured both during the
day and at night, and the nighttime measurement was also
adopted to detect the iop response in fpko mice. in addition,
the functional integrity of the uveoscleral outflow pathway in
fpko was suggested by bunazosin.
interestingly,  xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone completely
failed to lower iop in fpko mice. thus,  xxxd340xxx  and
unoprostone may lower iop in mice via their converted acid
forms, which are bound to the  xxxg1878xxx ; this is supported

by reports of previous in vitro studies.1,4 –11 recent reports also
indicate that  xxxd340xxx  can stimulate human fp receptors.1,5,7,8 however, it is possible that fp agonists produced by
 xxxd340xxx  and unoprostone act on fp receptors via unknown signal pathways. to clarify this issue, determination of
pg analogues in the aqueous after instillation of  xxxd340xxx 
and unoprostone in fpko mice will be required.
the mechanism of iop reduction by  xxxd340xxx  has been
thought to involve improvements in conventional and uveoscleral outflow pathways in monkeys and humans.24,25 thus,
 xxxd340xxx  may also mediate iop reduction via receptors
other than fp receptors, which mainly affect the uveoscleral
outflow pathway.  xxxd340xxx  free acid can also bind to the
 xxxg1872xxx .1 however, the absence of iop reduction in
fpko mice suggests that the contributions of other receptors
are limited, as far as the early iop-lowering mechanism of
 xxxd340xxx  is concerned.
unoprostone may act as a weak fp agonist, despite having
low affinities for all prostanoid receptors.1 this is also supported by the cellular responses seen in cultured ciliary muscle
cells and trabecular meshwork cells.1,5,7,8 stimulation of pge2
release by unoprostone free acid and further metabolites13,14
may be unrelated to the iop-lowering effect, at least in mice.
 xxxd3414xxx  significantly lowered iop in wt mice both during the day and at night in the present study. these results are
comparable with those of our previous study using ddy
mice.21 the absence of a  xxxd3414xxx -induced iop-lowering effect in fpko mice is an expected outcome considering its
higher selectivity, potency, and affinity for the  xxxg1878xxx 
compared to  xxxd2446xxx .5,7
it must be noted that the present results involve the ocular
hypotensive effect after a single instillation of a pg analogue in
mice, which implies that direct extrapolation of the present
results to humans or glaucoma patients may be difficult. clinically it is well known that iop reduction after a single instillation of  xxxd2446xxx  is not so remarkable as after once-daily
long-term instillation. the mechanism of action after a single
instillation may be different from that after long-term use.
ocular hypotensive effects by various pg analogues obtained
in mice do not seem to parallel those in humans. in fact, the
ocular hypotensive effect of  xxxd2446xxx  tended to be a little
greater than that of  xxxd340xxx  in mice (fig. 2), while previous studies suggested that the ocular hypotensive effect of
 xxxd340xxx  tended to be a little greater than that of  xxxd2446xxx  in human patients.26 –29 in the present study, we demonstrated that iop reduction after a single application of pg
analogues in mice was fp-receptor dependent, suggesting that
fp receptors are at least partly involved in the ocular hypotensive effect of  xxxd2446xxx ,  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , or unoprostone in humans as well. effects of  xxxd340xxx  or unoprostone
in humans cannot be explained only by fp receptors. therefore, further studies are required to clarify the involvement of

iovs, november 2005, vol. 46, no. 11
the  xxxg1878xxx  in iop reduction with long-term administration
of fp agonists.
because iop lowering is primarily mediated via fp receptors, it is an interesting question whether ocular side effects
induced by pg analogues are also observed in fpko mice.
since fpko mice have similar iop patterns and seemingly
normal functional uveoscleral outflow pathways (both functionally and structurally), fpko mice may be useful in developing new pg-analogue drugs with greater ocular hypotensive
potential and lesser ocular side effects.
in conclusion, the finding that  xxxd3414xxx ,  xxxd340xxx , and
isopropyl unoprostone, as well as  xxxd2446xxx , failed to lower
iop in fpko mice provides evidence that the  xxxg1878xxx  plays
a critical role in the iop-lowering effect of these pg analogues,
at least as far as short-term effects are concerned.
