abstract: estrogen receptors (era and erb) are ligand-activated transcription factors. we examined the effects of estradiol (e2), 4- xxxd91xxx  (ht), and the estrogen response element (ere) on the helical content and thermal unfolding
of erb. a circular dichroism (cd) spectrum of erb showed changes at 210 and 222 nm that were due to the presence of
e2, which is indicative of partial unfolding. in contrast, ht did not alter the cd spectrum of erb. the addition of e2 +
ere caused an increase in the a-helical content and an increase in the temperature midpoint of folding transition (tm)
from 39 ± 0.7 8c to 57.2 ± 1 8c. the addition of e2 + mutant ere, or e2 + control oligonucleotide, increased the tm of
erb to 45 ± 2 8c only. in the presence of ht, erb yielded similar tm values (55–58 8c) with ere, mutant ere, or control oligodeoxynucleotide. the binding affinity of erb for ere increased 125.7-fold as a result of the presence of e2, but
only 4-fold as a result of ht. these results demonstrate coupled effects of e2 and ere on erb stability and binding affinity. the increased thermal stability of ht–erb–ere was associated with reduced specificity of erb–ere recognition, illustrating profound differences in conformational states of erb induced by e2 and ht.

introduction
estrogens regulate the development and function of the
female reproductive system and play important roles in the
function of skeletal, endothelial, and nervous systems
(thomas et al. 2004; katzenellenbogen and frasor 2004;
mcdonnell 2005). estrogen receptors (era and erb) are
pharmacological targets of breast cancer and the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen is widely used to treat patients with
er-positive tumors. era and erb mediate the action of
endogenous and environmental estrogens, and are part of
the nuclear receptor superfamily of regulatory proteins
(mcdonnell 2005; smith and o’malley 2004; kuiper et al.
1997). era and erb have unique or overlapping functions
in mediating estrogenic function, depending on the promoter
context and the cellular level of the receptors (matthews and
gustafsson 2003). in cells expressing era and erb, era
has dominant effects; however, era and erb have opposing
functions in the transcriptional response of certain promoters
and in the growth of breast cancer cells (liu et al. 2002;
strom et al. 2004).
the transcription of an estrogen-responsive gene is initiated by a conformational change in ers upon estrogen binding, leading to the dissociation of chaperone proteins and
dimerization of era/erb as a homodimer or a heterodimer
(jordan 2004; klinge 2001). era and erb then bind to a
dna segment called the estrogen response element (ere),
consisting of a 13 bp inverted repeat, 5’-ggtcannntgacc, located in the upstream region of estrogenresponsive genes (klinge 2001; klein-hitpass et al. 1988).
estrogen-responsive genes contain single or multiple copies
of the ere, although in some cases they differ by 1 or more
nucleotides. accessory proteins, such as coactivators and
corepressors, modify the transcriptional responses initiated
by agonistic or antagonistic ligands in a tissue-specific manner (smith and o’malley 2004). however, distinct contributions of different ligands, eres, and coregulatory proteins to
the conformational plasticity of ers have not been defined.
furthermore, erb has a 3- to 4-fold lower affinity for the
ere, and as much as 10-fold weaker transcriptional activity
compared with era (melvin et al. 2004; schultz et al.
2002). unlike era, erb did not induce bending of the
ere toward the major groove of the dna helix (mcinerney
et al. 1998). we previously examined conformational
features of era and reported it to be a protein with high ahelical content (greenfield et al. 2001). here we report the
conformational dynamics of erb in the presence of agonistic (estradiol, e2) and antagonistic ( xxxd91xxx , ht)
ligands and the ere.
ht is an active metabolite of tamoxifen, the most widely
used breast cancer drug (jordan 2004). the mechanism of
action of tamoxifen involves the binding of ht and tamoxifen to er, antagonizing the stimulatory effects of e2 on
breast tumor growth. however, tamoxifen is not a simple
competitive inhibitor of e2 because tamoxifen acts as an agonistic ligand of era in endometrial cells (shang and
brown 2002). this dichotomous effect of tamoxifen is an
intense area of investigation and forms, in part, the basis of
tamoxifen-resistance which develops in most breast cancer
patients after a period of 2–5 years of treatment (berstein et
al. 2004; michalides et al. 2004). using circular dichroism

biochem. cell biol. vol. 85, 2007

(cd) spectroscopy, we analyzed the conformational dynamics of erb in an effort to reveal the intricacies of the mechanism of action of e2 and tamoxifen.
the interaction of erb with the ere has been studied by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa), transient transfection, fluorescence anisotropy, and x-ray crystallography
(schultz et al. 2002; driscoll et al. 1998; margeat et al.
2003; gewirth and sigler 1995). cd data complements information on the conformational transitions of erb. analysis of the secondary structure of erb showed that e2, but
not ht, induced an increase in random coils, whereas e2 +
ere, as well as ht + ere, caused an increase in a-helical
content. emsa shows distinct differences in e2 and htinduced changes in the affinity of erb for the ere. in the
presence of e2 + ere, the thermal stability and cooperativity of the unfolding transition of erb increased, indicating
the presence of a unique conformation that is not achieved by
erb in the presence of either e2 + mutant ere or ht + ere.

materials and methods
erb and other reagents
full-length recombinant human erb for cd studies was
purchased from invitrogen (carlsbad, california). the e2
binding activity of the erb preparation was determined using a hydroxyapatite assay (pavlik and coulson 1976) and
was found to be 3500 ± 150 pmol/ml. flag-tagged recombinant human erb1 (95 fmol/mg protein) expressed by baculovirus in sf21 cells (klinge et al. 2004) was used for
emsa experiments. ht and e2 were purchased from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, missouri). [3h]e2 and [a-32p]ttp
were purchased from perkinelmer life and analytical sciences (boston, massachusetts). anti-erb antibody for
‘supershift’ in emsa was obtained from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, california).
hplc-purified oligodeoxynucleotides (odns) were purchased from oligos, etc., inc. (wilsonville, oregon). the
integrity of the odns was tested using 5’-end labeling, followed by gel electrophoresis. a 41-mer odn, consisting of
the consensus ere from the vitellogenin gene and the complementary odn, was used (shah et al. 2001). a mutant
ere with 2 base pair differences and an odn with a
scrambled sequence consisting of a similar g–c content
were used as controls. the nucleotide sequences of the
ere, mutant ere, and control odn are as follows (the palindromic recognition sequence of the ere is underlined in
each): ere, 5’-gatccaggtcagagtgacctgagctaaaataacacattcag-3’ 3’-ggtccagtctcactggactcgattttattgtgtaagtc-5’; mutant ere, 5’gatccaggtcagagtgcactgagctaaaataacacattcag-3’ 3’-ggcctagtctcacgtgactcgattttattgtgtaagtc-5’; control odn, 5’-aaagctcgcttcctgaagacgttctcgaagagaaatctctt-3’ 3’-cgagcgaaggacttctgcaagagcttctctttagagaa5’.
odns were dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mmol/l
tris.hcl (ph 7.5) and 50 mmol/l nacl, and dialyzed
against the same buffer.
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
recombinant erb was analyzed by sds–page. protein

vijayanathan et al.

(1, 2.5, and 5 mg) was diluted in buffer containing 125 mmol/l
tris–hcl (ph, 8.0), 4% sds, 30% glycerol, and 150 mmol/l
dtt. the samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto
a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 200 v
with a running buffer containing 192 mmol/l glycine,
25 mmol/l  xxxd3449xxx , and 0.1% sds. the gel was fixed and
stained with a coomassie brilliant blue (0.25% in 45% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid) solution for 3 h and destained
in water for 4 h. protein molecular markers (perkinelmer life
and analytical sciences) were escherichia coli b galactosidase (116 kda), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (45 kda), and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29 kda).
cd spectroscopy
the stock erb solution was diluted 1:3 in a buffer such
that the final buffer concentration was 20 mmol/l tris–hcl
(ph 8), 125 mmol/l kcl, 2 mmol/l dtt, 0.25 mmol/l
edta, and 3.3% glycerol. diluted erb samples (1 mmol/l)
were incubated with 5 mmol/l of e2 or ht for 1 h at 4 8c
and (or) with 1 mmol/l ere or odn for 30 min at 25 8c.
data were collected on an aviv model 62d circular dichroism spectrophotometer (aviv, lakewood, new jersey) fitted
with a 5-compartment cell holder, using quartz cuvettes with
a 1 mm pathlength. spectra were collected from 260 to
200 nm at 0.25 nm intervals, with data collected for 2 s at
each point. data were smoothed using the method of
savitsky and golay (1964) and corrected for the contribution of the cells. spectra were also corrected for the contribution of the ere in samples containing erb and the ere,
although this does not account for any changes in the cd
spectrum of ere that would be due to protein binding. the
secondary structural content of erb was estimated by fitting
the data using the neural net program of bohm et al. (1992)
and by a nonconstrained least-squares-fit of the data to peptide reference standards (brahms and brahms 1980).
determination of thermodynamic parameters
the thermal stability of erb was determined by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature.
data were collected from 25 to 70 8c at 0.2 8c intervals,
with data collected at each point for 5 s. the apparent temperature midpoint of folding transition (tm) values and enthalpies of folding were determined by fitting the data using
the following equations:
½1

k ¼ expf½h=rt½ðt=tm þ  1g

½2

y ¼ k=ð1 þ kþ

½3

obs ¼ ðmax  min þyþ min

where yobs is the ellipticity found at any temperature, ymax is
the ellipticity corresponding to the fully folded receptor,
ymin is the ellipticity corresponding to the unfolded erb,
h is the apparent van’t hoff enthalpy of folding and r is
the universal gas constant (1.986 cal/mol; 1 cal = 4.184 j)
(greenfield et al. 2001). the thermal unfolding of the receptor is irreversible; hence, the enthalpy calculated using this
method is not a true thermodynamic parameter. additionally, no corrections were made for the contribution of the
ligands or stoichiometry of the complexes. the rates of

3

heating were identical for all samples, and replicate measurements were reproducible. therefore, even though the
samples irreversibly denatured at high temperatures, the
comparison of tm and slopes of the denaturation curves of
the receptor in the presence and absence of ligands remains
valid. the enthalpy values are given solely as indicators of
the relative cooperativities of the unfolding transitions under
different conditions.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) and er–
ere dissociation constant (kd) determination
emsas were used to determine the affinity of e2- or htoccupied erb for ere (5’-ccaggtcagagtgacctgagctaaaataacacatt-3’) (tyulmenkov and klinge
2001a, 2001b). details of the emsa experiments to estimate
er–ere binding affinity have been described previously
(tyulmenkov and klinge 2001b). in brief, to measure the kd
for erb-ere interaction, reactions included 7 nmol/l erb
(as measured by [3h]e2-binding capacity in a hydroxyapatite assay pavlik and coulson 1976), with increasing concentrations of [32p]ere (0.09 – 25 nmol/l), prepared by
fill-in labeling with [32p]a-dttp (nen) using the klenow
fragment of e. coli pol i. to measure kd in competition
assays, reactions included 7 nmol/l erb, 3.8 nmol/l
[32p]ere, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled mutant ere (50 nmol/l – 5 mmol/l). all reactions also included 40 mmol/l tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 60 mmol/l kcl,
100 nmol/l e2 or 100 nmol/l ht, 0.75 mg/ml purified
bsa (new england biolabs, ipswich, massachusetts),
25 mg/ml poly(di-dc) (midland certified reagent company, midland, texas), and 15% (v/v) glycerol in a final
volume of 20 ml. erb was preincubated with e2 or ht
prior to addition of the [32p]ere with or without unlabeled
mutant ere. the reaction was incubated for 30 min at
room temperature, loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 tbe (where 1 tbe = 0.1 mol/l tris
base, 83.1 mmol/l boric acid, 1 mmol/l edta, ph 8.3)
and electrophoresed at 200 v for 2.25 h. at 4 8c. dried
emsa gels were analyzed using a packard instruments instantimager and associated software, packard imager for
windows v2.04 (ramsey et al. 2004). the amounts of the
erb-bound and free ere were quantified using a packard
instant imager. the concentrations of free and erb-bound
[32p]ere were fitted to the 1-site binding model (determination coefficient r2 > 0.95). the concentrations of erbbound [32p]ere in the presence of unlabeled mutant ere
were fitted to 1-site competition model (determination coefficient r2 > 0.90).
statistical analysis
cd spectral data and tm values are presented as means ±
sd for at least 3 separate experiments. statistical difference
between control erb samples and those with different additions were determined by a 1-way anova, followed by
tukey’s test (graph pad prism software program, san
diego, california). p values <0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

page. erb protein (1, 2, and 5 mg) was loaded onto the gel
and electrophoresis was conducted under denaturing conditions. as can be seen from fig. 1, only 1 protein band of
53 kda was observed. thus, the erb preparation was free
of contaminating proteins.
cd spectroscopy is generally used to detect conformational alterations in proteins and nucleic acids in response
to the presence of ligands or denaturing agents, or changes
in temperature or ph. figure 2a shows the cd spectra of
erb in the presence or absence of e2, e2 + ere, e2 + mutant ere, or e2 + control odn. in the absence of the ligands, the cd spectrum of erb showed negative peaks at
210 and 222 nm regions, which is indicative of a protein
with mixed a-helices and b-sheets. the addition of e2
caused a pronounced decrease in the ellipticity at 210 and
222 nm. however, the addition of e2 + ere caused a significant increase in the ellipticity at 210 nm and 222 nm, compared with the spectrum in the presence of e2 alone. figure
2b shows the cd spectra of erb in the presence of the
ere, mutant ere, and control odn in the absence of e2.
there were only minor changes in the cd spectrum of erb
in the presence of the ere, suggesting that ere alone is not
sufficient for the increase in ellipticity observed in the presence of e2 + ere.
the specificity of the erb–ere interaction was examined using a mutant ere with a 2 bp difference from the
consensus ere and a nonspecific control sequence. in the
presence of e2, the interaction of erb with the nonspecific
odn led to a significant increase in ellipticity at 210 nm
compared with that of the sample with e2 alone, but there
was no change at 222 nm. with e2 and the mutant ere,
the spectrum of erb showed minor increases in ellipticity
at 210 and 222 nm compared with the sample containing e2
alone. the effect of mutant ere was negligible in the absence of e2. although erb showed an increase in ellipticity
at 208 nm in the presence of control odn, this change was
distinctly different from that induced by e2 + ere.
to estimate the secondary structure of erb, we analyzed
the cd spectra by a neural net program, using a protein database. our results are presented in table 1. this analysis
showed that native erb contains approximately 55% ahelix, 9% b-sheet, and 13% b-turns under our experimental
conditions. the addition of e2 decreased the a-helical content to 38%, suggesting that the addition of e2 may partially

different from that of samples treated with e2 alone, it is

fig. 5. unfolding profile of erb in the presence of  xxxd91xxx  (ht) and specific or nonspecific dna sequences. the ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored as a function of temperature and
the data were fitted into monophasic or biphasic models. curves
shown are as follows: &, control; *, ht; ~, ht + ere; ^,

odn, oligodeoxynucleotide.

note: the ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored as a function of temperature and the data were fit into a 2-state transition (between the folded and
unfolded states) to calculate the apparent tm and enthalpy values presented.
data on erb in the presence of e2, ht, and e2 + ere could also fit into a
biphasic transition. the second transition, in the presence of e2 and ht,
yielded tm values of 54.4 and 57.1, respectively, suggesting greater protein
domain stabilization in the presence of these ligands. erb in the presence
of e2 + ere yielded a second transition with a tm value of 33.5. data are

content of erb. these results show differences in the interaction of e2 and ht with erb, and suggest that subsequent
interactions of erb with ere, ere-like, and nonspecific
sequences are dependent on the conformational features of
the liganded erb.
we next measured the stability of erb in the presence of
e2, ht, and the ere by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm
as a function of temperature. figure 4 represents the unfolding profile of erb in the presence of e2, e2 + ere, e2 +
mutant ere, or e2 + control odn. the tm values and apparent enthalpy changes for unfolding transition were determined by fitting the data to 1 or 2 transitions and the results
are presented in table 2. in the presence of e2, the tm of
erb increased slightly, from 39 to 42 8c. in the presence of
e2 + ere, the thermal stability of erb increased significantly, as illustrated by a tm of 57 8c. in contrast, control
odn and mutated ere increased the tm of erb to 45 and
47 8c, respectively. in the absence of e2, ere stabilized
erb to a lesser extent compared with its effect in the presence of e2, whereas both the mutant ere and control odn
had a similar level of stabilization with and without e2.
the melting profile of erb also changed with the addition of ht (fig. 5). the unfolding of erb in the presence
of ht showed a tm of 42 8c. the presence of ht + ere,
ht + mutant ere, or ht + control odn stabilized erb,
with tm values ranging from 55 to 58 8c. these results indicate that the ere, mutant ere, and nonspecific odn
bind to erb in a nonselective manner when ht is bound.
in addition, the melting profiles of erb in the presence of
e2 or ht, as well as that in the presence of e2 + ere,
showed biphasic transitions, indicating the presence of partially unfolded intermediate states. binding of the ligand may
induce differential stabilization of the ligand binding domain

(lbd) or dna binding domain (dbd), resulting in 2-state
unfolding transitions.
to test whether the generalized stabilization of ht–erb
complex in the presence of the ere or mutant ere is reflected in the binding affinity, we determined the kd values
of erb for ere and mutant ere binding. representative
competitive emsa data are given in fig. 6. kd values of
erb for mutant ere showed that unliganded erb and e2–
erb bound mutant ere with comparable affinity, although
ht–erb showed a 3-fold lower kd value compared with unliganded erb (table 3). the determination of kd values for
erb–ere interaction showed that e2 binding increased the
erb binding affinity for ere by 125.7-fold (table 3). the
increased binding affinity of e2–erb, compared with unliganded erb, is consistent with its increased thermal stability in the presence of the ere. however, in the presence of
ht, erb binding affinity increased only by 4-fold, compared with unliganded erb. moreover, e2–erb bound to
the ere with 31.4-fold higher affinity compared with ht–
erb. in addition, the ratio of kd values of ht–erb for mutant ere and ere was 118.2, whereas that of e2–erb for
mutant ere and ere was 9 000, indicating distinct differences in specificity.

discussion
the ere sequence plays a major role in coactivator recruitment in ligand-induced transcriptional activity (wood
et al. 2001; ramsey and klinge 2001). hormone-induced

plained by the striking change in the positioning of helix 12
of the lbd (brzozowski et al. 1997). since crystal structures have only been determined from the lbd or dbd of
the ers (brzozowski et al. 1997; kong et al. 2005), there is
a deficiency in the knowledge of ligand-induced conformational changes in full-length era and erb. recent studies
using tryptophan fluorescence indicate a complex interplay
of protein stability and flexibility in the binding of era
with different ere sequences (bouter et al. 2005). longrange interactions between the amino-terminal a region and
the carboxy-terminal e region may also modulate the active
conformation of ers (metivier et al. 2002). our studies using cd spectroscopy of the full-length erb provide insights
into ligand- and dna-induced conformational changes in
this receptor protein.
our results show that erb undergoes a larger conformational change in the presence of e2 compared with that in
the presence of ht. the addition of e2 + ere caused an increase in the a-helical content compared with the structural
features of erb in the presence of e2 alone. the binding of
e2 + ere also caused an 18 8c increase in the tm of erb
(fig. 4; table 2). in the presence of e2, the interaction of
erb with the ere was highly specific, with erb bound to
mutant and control odns, showing lower stability and ahelical content than erb bound to the ere. interestingly,

the addition of e2 alone caused an increased disorder
(table 1) or conformational flexibility that might be important for the interaction of ere with the dbd of erb and
for base-specific recognition. in contrast to e2, ht alone
did not induce a large change in erb structure. ere, mutant
ere, and control odn enhanced the thermal stability of
erb in the presence of ht, indicating a lack of specificity
(fig. 5; table 2). the measurement of binding affinity of
e2–erb for the ere and mutant ere showed a 9000-fold
difference, whereas the affinity of ht–erb and unliganded
erb for ere and mutant ere showed 118.2- and 71.6-fold
differences, respectively, indicating the greater nucleotide
specificity of e2–erb (fig. 6; table 3). the stabilization of
erb in the presence of ht and nonspecific dna might
hamper the search for specific sequences when the protein
is presented with a random sequence containing ere.
although ht + ere induced conformational changes in
erb, the reduced nucleotide specificity suggests nonproductive interactions at the promoter sites containing ere.
era and erb share a high degree of structural homology
in the dbd, but only a moderately conserved lbd (kuiper
et al. 1996; hall and korach 2002). hall and korach (2002)
suggested that estrogen-responsive promoters communicate
differently with xenoestrogens by regulating era–erb
structures in distinct ways. structural differences in the lbd
partly account for the specificities of each subtype for different estrogenic ligands. our results show that the trend in e2and ere-induced conformational changes of erb, as determined by cd spectra, is generally similar to that of era
(greenfield et al. 2001). the binding of e2 + ere produced conformational changes with an increase in the ahelical content of both ers, compared with that produced
by e2 alone. increases in ellipticity (222 nm) and thermal
stability also indicate ligand- and dna-induced conformational changes in ers. these data are supported by previous protease sensitivity assays that showed unique er
digestion patterns with different eres, indicating the availability of different cleavage sites due to ere-induced con#

formational changes (wood et al. 2001; ramsey and
klinge 2001; yi et al. 2002).
recent studies on nonspecific and specific protein–dna
complexes (lac repressor–operator), using the multidimensional nmr technique, underscore the importance of nonspecific binding in searching or recognizing the specific site
(kalodimos et al. 2004). a hinge region of the dbd of lac
repressor remained unstructured in the free state and in the
nonspecific dna–protein complex, but folded into an ahelix upon specific dna binding (kalodimos et al. 2004).
the dna conformation of the nonspecific lac repressor
complex remained in the b-dna form, whereas a *368
bend occurred in the specific dna–protein complex. the
differential effects of era and erb in the induction of directed bending in the ere was attributed to the carboxylterminal extension (cte) of the dbd (schultz et al. 2002).
the cte appears to participate in dna–protein interactions
by extending the interactions beyond the base-specific contacts. in our studies, e2 + ere increased the tm of both
era (greenfield et al. 2001) and, as reported here, erb.
thus, the coupled effects of e2 and ere on ers lead to the
formation of stable complexes with high tm values. in the
absence of a measurable bend, erb may induce distortions
in the ere backbone that aligns protein–dna interfaces
(siggers et al. 2004). previous studies show that erb transmits estrogenic effects with reduced potency compared with
era, and that the allosteric interactions of these receptors
with the ere are dependent on the ligand (melvin et al.
2004; schultz et al. 2002; hall et al. 2002). our cd data
show a lower percentage of a-helices in e2 erb–ere complexes compared with e2 era –ere complexes (greenfield
et al. 2001), supporting a model of subtype-specific differences in er–dna interaction.
increased thermal stability of the erb in the presence of
e2 + ere indicates a close association of the receptor with
the ere. e2 did not have a large effect on the tm values
(tm = 3 8c) and actually decreased the co-operativity of
unfolding, thereby suggesting that e2 destabilizes the receptor (table 2). the extent of erb stabilization by the control
odn and mutant ere (tm = 6–8 8c) was much lower
than that induced by the ere (tm = 18 8c). the binding
of erb to nonspecific sequences may largely depend on
electrostatic interactions of dna back-bone and the basic
amino acids, whereas specific binding involves recognition
of base pairs. thus, the formation of the e2–erb complex
with mutant and control odn yielded a complex with reduced stability compared with that produced by specific e2
erb–ere complexes. however, ht and erb formed highly
stable complexes, even with nonspecific dna. this observation suggests a reduced ability of ht–erb complexes to slide
through a nonspecific sequences in a 1-dimensional diffusion
process, as has been described for other dna–protein interactions (kabata et al. 1993).
our emsa experiments confirm that e2 induced a conformational state with higher affinity for ere compared with
unliganded erb or ht-bound erb (fig. 6; table 3). as
suggested by the conserved amino acid sequence of the
dbds of era and erb, both receptors bind to the same
ere sequence. our results on the kd values of erb–ere
interactions are consistent with previous reports
(tyulmenkov and klinge 2001a; ramsey et al. 2004;

biochem. cell biol. vol. 85, 2007

cowley et al. 1997). while era and erb bind to the ere
in the absence of e2, an increased association constant of
era–ere binding in the presence of e2 has been reported
using an ere–sepharose binding assay (melamed et al.
1996). functional studies using ere-driven reporter gene
expression show that ht is a pure antagonist in the presence
of erb, whereas it is a partial agonist–antagonist in the
presence of era (barkhem et al. 1998; ramsey et al.
2004). thus, e2 and ht appear to induce a unique conformational fit between erb and ere, leading to ligandspecific differences in binding affinity and nucleotide specificity of erb, and thereby different transcriptional responses.
although era is the predominant receptor in breast cancer, erb modulates the activity of era, and breast cancer
progression is accompanied by the changes in the ratio of
era to erb (esslimani-sahla et al. 2004). estrogens also
exhibit pharmacological differences at various genes when
acting through era or erb, thus illustrating a unique sensitivity of erb to antiestrogen binding (paech et al. 1997). xray and computational studies on selectivity of genistien for
erb show that both protein and the ligand adjust their conformational states upon complex formation, leading to the
most favorable free energy change (manas et al. 2004). in
addition, ligand binding molds the co-activator binding
pocket of ers and other nuclear receptors, thus setting
their affinity for the co-activators and thereby the degree
of transcriptional activation (nettles et al. 2004). the differential sensitivity of erb conformation for e2, ht, and
ere may reflect the unique functions of erb at different
ere sites.
in summary, our results provide the first definition of distinct conformational features and thermal stability of erb in
response to ere binding in the presence of e2 or ht. e2
binding resulted in a loss of ellipticity and a-helical content
of erb, whereas the addition of the ere restored the ahelicity and increased the thermal stability of erb. in contrast to e2, ht did not induce significant changes in the
cd spectrum. both e2 and ht had marginal effects on
the tm of erb as single agents; however, a substantial increase in the tm was observed when e2 or ht was combined with the ere. the increase in the stability of erb
in the presence of e2 + ere was specific to the consensus
ere sequence, whereas a mutant ere was less efficient.
in the presence of ht, erb was stabilized by both consensus ere and the control odn, indicating a lack of selectivity. the determination of binding affinity of erb to the
ere and mutant ere in the presence of e2 or ht supports the existence of conformational variants with reduced
selectivity in the presence of ht and increased affinity in
the presence of e2. these results demonstrate that the conformation and stability of erb are dictated by both the ligand and the ere. our results also show that e2 induces a
relatively unordered structure of erb, whereas the presence of e2 + ere promotes a more ordered structure. the
occupation of erb by ht led to nonselective binding of
erb to the ere and other sequences, offering a possible
mechanism for nonproductive erb–ere interactions and
the lack of transcriptional activation in its presence.
