background: the effects of histamine h1 antagonist  xxxd1667xxx  on rat palate development were characterized
following in utero exposure. methods: to identify the optimum dose for inducing cleft palate, pregnant rats were
administered 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  on gestation days 11 to 14. fetal palate gene expression was also
assessed after 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  at 8, 15 and 30 hours post-dose on gestation day 14 using microarray and
qrt-pcr. results: rats in the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups exhibited adverse clinical signs and body weight loss. rats in
the 90-mg/kg group also demonstrated increases in late resorptions and decreases in fetal weight. effects in the lowdose group were limited to decreases in body weight gain. fetal assessment on gestation day 21 revealed that findings
were limited to the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups, and included cleft palate (80% of litters for both groups), high arched
palate, small nose, micrognathia, high domed head, digits shortened/absent and small limb. the fetal incidence of cleft
palate was higher at 90 mg/kg, thus this dose was selected to assess palate gene expression. the altered genes associated
with  xxxd1667xxx -induced cleft palate included  xxxd2482xxx , bmp2, bmp4, fgf10,  xxxg792xxx , msx1, and insig1 but the magnitude
of the change was relatively small (1.5- to 2-fold). conclusions: expression of several genes involved in palate, limb
and digit development was altered in the fetal palate following in utero exposure to  xxxd1667xxx . the subtle
perturbation and interplay of these genes may have profound effects on the dynamics of fetal palate development. birth

introduction
development of the secondary palate in mammals
begins as bilateral outgrowths from the maxillary
processes. these palatal shelves initially grow down the
sides of the tongue, but elevate to a horizontal position
above the dorsum of the tongue and fuse with each other
to form an intact palate. a number of hypotheses have
been proposed to explain palatal shelf elevation, including muscular contraction (innes, 1978), hydrostatic forces
associated with glycosaminoglycans (pratt et al., 1973),
mesenchymal reorganization (zimmerman and wee,
1984), and epithelial organization (luke, 1984). in
mammals, the medial edge epithelium (mee) of the
opposing shelves adhere to each other to form an
epithelial seam, which then disrupts cell death and cell
migration into the mesenchyme, accompanied by an
epitheliomesenchymal transformation (reviewed by
ferguson, 1988). the molecular mechanisms of normal
and abnormal palate development are poorly understood, but it appears that growth factors (such as egf,
tgf, pdgf, and fgf) and genes (such as gaba and
 xxxd2482xxx ) are involved (reviewed by lione and scialli,
1996). these data indicate that mammalian secondary

palate development is a complex, multi-step process,
which if disturbed, can result in cleft palate.
this study was conducted to better understand the
molecular mechanisms involved in early palatogenesis
and cleft palate formation.  xxxd1667xxx , an h1 histamine antagonist, has been previously shown to cause
cleft palate in rodents (tuchmann-duplessis and
mercier-parot, 1963; reviewed by lione and scialli, 1996).
the anti-histamine/antiemetic, meclizine, is in the same
class (piperazine) and has been more extensively studied
in humans than  xxxd1667xxx . based on the product label
(antivert, 2006), meclizine causes cleft palate in rats at
25–50 times the human dose, but epidemiological studies
in pregnant women have not shown an increased risk of
fetal abnormalities. given the available data for  xxxd1667xxx  in the rat, it was selected as a positive control in our

gene expression in rat palate development
studies. published studies with  xxxd1667xxx  indicated
that doses of 460 mg/kg to rats on gestation days (gds)
12 to 15 produced 100% fetal malformation (king et al.,
1965a). furthermore, the severity of malformations increased with increasing dose (up to 125 mg/kg), and
included edema and micromelia following administration
on gd 12 to 15. administration of lower doses and/or
administration during different gestation periods were
also assessed. doses of 50 mg/kg on gds 10 to 15 and 12 to
15 produced 82 and 27.5% fetal malformations, respectively. interestingly, administration of 25 or 50 mg/kg on
gds 1 to 15 only produced one malformation at each dose
level (or 2.4 and 0.1%, respectively). fetuses from rats
administered  xxxd1667xxx  and its metabolite norchlorcyclizine on gds 10 to 14 exhibited cleft palate and
mandibular reductions (king, 1963; king et al., 1965b;
wilk et al., 1978a). it has been proposed that cleft palate
associated with  xxxd1667xxx  and norchlorcyclizine could
be a secondary result of the mandibular reduction
allowing the tongue to act as a physical barrier to shelf
elevation. other plausible hypotheses include effects on
local vasculature or effects on glycosaminoglycans at the
mee (diewert and pratt, 1979; wilk et al., 1978b). in light
of the data presented above demonstrating the ability for
 xxxd1667xxx  to induce a high incidence of cleft palate in
the rat,  xxxd1667xxx  is considered an appropriate positive
control for use in the assessment of related gene expression
changes.

materials and methods
animals and husbandry
timed-mated crl:cds [sd] female rats between 9 and
13 weeks of age at initiation of dosing and weighing
between 245 and 363 g were obtained from charles river
laboratories inc. (kingston, ny). the female rats were
mated overnight by the supplier and the day on which
mating was confirmed was designated as gd 0. rats were
uniquely identified by tattoo and were individually housed
in suspended stainless steel wire-bottom cages. rats were
acclimated to laboratory conditions prior to initiation of
dosing. certified prolab rodent diet (pmi nutrition international, inc.; brentwood, mo) and water was provided ad
libitum. the room in which the animals were housed was
maintained at 72741f, relative humidity 30–70%, and had a
12-hour light/dark cycle. the use of animals in this study
followed the guidelines provided in the guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals (1996) and the animal welfare
act (1966). this study was approved by the facility’s
institutional animal care and use committee and was
conducted in an association for the assessment and
accreditation of laboratory animal care (aaalac)
accredited facility.

control and test articles
a control article was not used for experiment 1.
control article for experiment 2: 0.4 % (w/v)  xxxd2609xxx  (dow chemical, midland, mi) diluted in distilled,
deionized water. test article:  xxxd1667xxx  (99% purity;
sigma, st. louis, mo), suspended in sterile water for
irrigation, u.s.p. (abbott, abbott park, il). the test

cleft palate collection
the dam was euthanized following exposure to carbon
dioxide. the fetus was removed from the uterus and
euthanized following exposure to carbon dioxide and/or
beuthanasia-d-special (schering-plough, kenilworth, nj)
except as noted. fetuses designated for gene expression
analysis were euthanized by decapitation at 8 to 30 hours
post-dose on gd 14. palate collection for gene expression
analysis was done using clean instruments and methods to
avoid cross-contamination between litters and between
normal and cleft palates. the head of the fetus was
removed from the body, and the mandible and tongue were
removed with a cut through the mouth on both sides of the
oral cavity. palates for staging, standard histology and
electron microscopic analysis were then evaluated and
processed as described below. palates for gene expression
analysis were further dissected as follows: the remaining
maxillary, nasal, and cranial tissue on either side of the
secondary palatal shelve was trimmed away; the cranial
portion was removed using a horizontal cut above the
maxilla, below the level of the eyes; the primary palate was
removed at the point where it meets the secondary palatal
shelves. secondary palatal shelves for gene expression
analysis were weighed and frozen with liquid nitrogen
within a target time of 5 min after euthanasia of each fetus.
palate tissue was stored in a 801c freezer until use.

study design
staging and evaluation of normal rat fetal
palate development. rats were administered a single
daily oral gavage dose of sterile water for irrigation u.s.p.
(baxtor, cleveland, ms)  xxxd1891xxx  ml/kg on gd 13 and 14.
dams and fetuses were euthanized at 30, 48, 56, and
72 hours post-dose gd 14 (5 litters per interval, n 5 6–7
fetuses per litter except for one litter at the 30-hour interval
in which only 2 fetuses were evaluated). palates were
collected and evaluated for staging (described below),
standard histology, and electron microscopic analysis. for
electron microscopic analysis, palates were fixed in 70%
ethanol, processed in stages of 70, 95, or 100% ethanol, and
then mounted on scanning electron microscopy (sem)
stubs using silver paint adhesive, which were then sputter
coated with gold-palladium and evaluated using a hitachi
s-520 scanning electron microscope.

experiment 1: assessment of maternal and fetal
toxicity following exposure to  xxxd1667xxx .
experiment 1 was a dose-range-finding study to establish the optimum dose of  xxxd1667xxx  capable of
inducing cleft palate in fetal rats. once identified, this
dose was used in experiment 2.
rats were administered a single daily oral gavage dose
of 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  (n 5 8/group)
during the sensitive period for palate development,
gds 11 to 14. these doses were selected such that
30 mg/kg was a likely no-effect dose and higher doses of
60 and/or 90 mg/kg would induce a moderate or high
incidence of fetal cleft palate, based on data by king et al.
(1965a). given that crl:cds [sd] rats have an extremely low incidence of spontaneous cleft palate in the
testing laboratory, as well as to avoid unnecessary use of
animals, a  xxxd2609xxx  control group was omitted.
to assess palate development dynamics, a subset of
litters (n 5 3/group) were euthanized on gd 17. fetal
palates were then classified as not contacted, contacted,

476

enright et al.

partially fused, or fused, as described by shimizu et al.
(2001) in mice. the following criteria were used for
staging: (1) not contacted: secondary palates grew
vertically and were horizontally elevated but were not in
contact with each other. (2) contacted: secondary palates
were in contact with each other at the mid-palate region
but were not fused. (3) partially fused: secondary palates
were fused but the fused portion of the palatal shelves did
not exceed approximately 50% of the total medial length.
(4) fused: fused portion of the palatal shelves exceed
approximately 50% of the total medial edge length.
for experiment 1, the endpoints examined on
gd 17 consisted of maternal body weight, number of
corpora lutea, number of implantation sites, number of
resorptions, number of live fetuses, and pre- and postimplantation loss. in addition, the remaining litters were
euthanized on gd 21 (n 5 5/group) to assess fetal
external palate formation at term. fetal endpoints
consisted of viability, body weight, and external development. maternal endpoints examined on gd 21
consisted of body weight, number of corpora lutea,
number of implantation sites, number of resorptions,
number of live fetuses, and pre- and post-implantation
loss.

experiment 2: assessment of palate development
and palate gene expression changes following
exposure to  xxxd1667xxx . in experiment 2, pregnant rats were administered a single daily oral gavage
dose of 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  or 0.4% (w/v)  xxxd2609xxx  over gds 11 to14 (n 5 6/group). this  xxxd1667xxx  dose level was based on the results from
experiment 1, and was selected to induce a high
incidence of cleft palate in exposed fetuses.
dams and fetuses were euthanized at 8, 15, and 30 h
post-dose gd 14. fetuses were subsequently removed
from the uterus and the secondary palate was
trimmed and placed in rnalater rna stabilization
solution (qiagen, valencia, ca) for subsequent genomic
analysis.
rna extraction. total rna was extracted from all
collected palates using the rneasy micro kit (qiagen,
chatsworth, ca) as previously described by wang et al.
(2008). each palate sample was placed in 350 ml rlt
buffer in a 2-ml microfuge tube with a stainless steel
bead. the palate rna sample was homogenized in the
tissuelyzer (qiagen) for 2 min at 30 hz and centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. the
subsequent rna extraction steps were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the quality
and quantity of the purified rna from each palate was
determined by rna 6000 nano kit using the 2100
bioanalyzer lab-on-a-chip system (agilent technologies, palo alto, ca) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions.

amplification, labeling and hybridization of
rna. litters from 18 dams were selected for microarray profiling: 3 litters per group with collection time
points within each group of 8, 15, and 30 h post-dose
gd 14. equal amounts of rna from each fetus in a litter
were pooled. five micrograms of this pooled rna
sample from each litter was amplified, labeled, and
hybridized to a single microarray (rat genome genechip
230 2.0, affymetrix, santa clara, ca) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (genechip expression
analysis technical manual, 701021 rev 4; affymetrix).

the microarray data were analyzed using the
genespring 6.1 (agilent technologies). the results of
the built-in controls for the genechips showed that the
microarray performed very well in terms of sensitivity,
low background noise, and signal strength. examination
of individual genechips using scatter plots showed
excellent correlation of signal strength of the biological
replicates. all microarray data from the treated groups
were first normalized against their concurrent control
groups, and the fold change between the chlorcyclizinetreated and the concurrent control groups was then
calculated using a confidence value of po0.05. the
number of genes whose expression level changed by
more than 1.5-fold in either direction (up-regulation or
down-regulation) between the  xxxd1667xxx -treated and
the concurrent control groups was 25, 21, and 40 at 8, 15,
and 30 h post-dose gd 14, respectively.
quantitative rt-pcr. thirty genes that were
identified in the microarray or selected from the
literature were subjected to quantitative rt-pcr (qrtpcr), using methods previously described by wang
et al. (2008). these methods are briefly summarized here.
total rna from each litter pool was converted to cdna
using taqman reverse transcription reagents (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the cdna sequences of all 30 genes
were obtained from genbank. pcr primer sequences
were designed using primerexpress software (applied
biosystems), and are listed in table 1. the sizes of the
pcr products were confirmed by running on an agilent
dna chip (agilent). the pcr reaction mixture was
prepared using taqman universal pcr master mix
kits (applied biosystems). the primer concentration
of tested genes was 200 nm, while that of 18 s rna
internal control was 100 nm. the pcr reactions were
conducted on an abi 7900ht fast real-time pcr system
(applied biosystems) with the following parameters:
501c for 2 min and 901c for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles at 951c for 15 sec and 601c for 1 min. the
melting curve was performed at 951c for 15 sec, 601c for
15 sec, 951c for 15 sec. the qrt-pcr data were analyzed
using the comparative ct method (user bulletin no. 2;
applied biosystems) and 18 s rrna was used as an
internal control to normalize all gene expression signals.
those gene changes that differed z1.5-fold compared
to the control litter were considered differentially
expressed.

results
normal fetal palate development in the rat
for baseline staging of palate development, fetuses
were collected from control rats at 30, 48, 56, or 72 h postdose gd 14. rat fetal palates were evaluated and
classified as not contacted, contacted, partially fused, or
fused (fig. 1). the fetal palates were found to be not
contacted at 30 h post-dose gd 14 and some (28.6% of
fetuses; 60% of litters) had contacted by 48 h post-dose
gd 14 (table 2). at 56 h post gd 14, the majority of
palates were contacted (78.6% of fetuses; 100% of litters)
and a few were either not contacted (14.3% of fetuses) or
partially fused (7.1% of fetuses). by 72 h post-dose gd 14,
the majority of palates (88% of fetuses; 100% of litters)
were fused and the remaining palates were partially

fused (12% of fetuses; 40% of litters). in light of the data
collected, the sampling interval for the microarray
analysis in subsequent studies was selected at earlier
intervals through 30 h post-dose gd 14 to detect possible
seminal gene expression changes.

experiment 1
pregnant rats administered 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg
 xxxd1667xxx  during the sensitive period for palate development survived until scheduled sacrifice on gds 17 or 21.
the rats administered 60 or 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx 
had transient adverse clinical signs (chromorhinorrhea,
red peri-oral substance, urogenital staining, and scant stool)
and a concomitant body weight loss of 7% and 11%,
respectively, over the dosing interval (table 3). rats
administered 30 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  did not exhibit any
adverse clinical signs, but did not gain weight over the dose
interval as would be expected during pregnancy. based on
the testing facility’s historical control database (16 studies,
n 5 380). pregnant rats typically gain about 6% body weight
from gds 12 to 15.
on gd 21, pregnant rats administered 90 mg/kg
 xxxd1667xxx  exhibited a biologically significant increase
in late resorptions, as well as a decrease in live litter size
and mean fetal body weight (table 4). fetuses in the
60- and 90-mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  groups exhibited cleft
palate following external examination on gd 21, with a %
fetal (litter) incidence of 37.7% (80%) and 59.3% (80%),
respectively (table 5). it is important to note that cleft palate
has not been observed in the testing facility’s historical
control database of rats, which includes more than 10,000
birth defects research (part b) 89:474–484, 2010

fetuses and 900 litters. others have reported that cleft palate
is rarely observed in the rat control population. an
evaluation of the marta/mta historical control population (1992–1994) revealed that the average incidence of cleft
palate was 0.323% litters and 0.036% fetuses (or 18/4,935
litters and 14/64,789 fetuses from 229 studies; marta/
mta, 1996). the incidence of cleft lip or palate was also
reported to be 0.02% of litters from 61 studies conducted at
wil research laboratories from 1998 to 2003 (hood, 2006).
additional fetal external findings observed at 60 and
90 mg/kg chlorcylcizine often occurred in the presence of
cleft palate, and included multiple cranofacial malformations (micrognathia, small nose, high domed head),
anasarca, shortened limbs/digits, and phocomelia. pregnant rats in the 30-mg/kg group did not exhibit cleft
palate or any fetal external findings on gd 21.
doses of 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  also altered
fetal palate growth by delaying/inhibiting palate formation as 88, 19.4, and 2.7% of fetuses, respectively
exhibited normally fused secondary palates following
evaluation on gd 17 (table 6). fetal palate growth was
only slightly delayed in the 30-mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx 
group since the delay was not sufficient to result in cleft
palate by gd 21. interestingly, the incidence of ‘‘not
contacted’’ palates in the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups on
gd 17 was higher than the incidence of cleft palate on
gd 21, also suggesting that  xxxd1667xxx  delayed, rather
than inhibited, palate development (tables 5 and 6).
therefore, based on the incidence of cleft palate and
effects on palate formation, a dose of 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  was selected for subsequent genomic analysis in
experiment 2.

fetal palate development. fetal palates were classified as not

and 450% contacted) and fused (d, g).

experiment 2
all dams in the 90-mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  group
survived until scheduled necropsy and exhibited findings that were consistent with those observed in
experiment 1. in the control group, 115 palates were
collected from 9 litters. in the  xxxd1667xxx  group, 156
palates were collected from 12 litters.
microarray analysis was performed on the pooled fetal
rna from each litter and gene lists with corresponding
information on fold-change are listed in table 7. this
microarray data was used in conjunction with literature
searches to select candidate genes for gene expression

analysis by qrt-pcr (table 8). other candidate genes
were also selected for qrt-pcr analysis; known association of gene expression and cleft palate was not
necessarily a prerequisite for selection. although the
fold-changes in microarray gene expression analysis
were relatively small, these data provided a useful guide
for selection of genes to quantify in addition to those
indicated in the literature. thus, the qrt-pcr data
discussed in subsequent sections is considered to be the
most accurate representation of the alterations in gene
expression induced by exposure to  xxxd1667xxx .
 xxxd1667xxx -induced changes in palate gene expression at 8 h post-dose gd 14 were suggested for 25 genes
by microarray (table 7). the following genes were
subsequently selected from the microarray gene list for
confirmation by qrt-pcr (table 1):  xxxg21xxx ,  xxxg329xxx ,
 xxxg1323xxx , pou3f3,  xxxg2150xxx , msx2, wif1, wnt4, and  xxxd2482xxx .
with the exception of  xxxg21xxx , the qrt-pcr data confirmed the microarray data. in addition, chlorcyclizineinduced qrt-pcr gene expression changes at 8 h
post-dose gd 14 occurred in gpnmb,  xxxg1135xxx , insig1, nfix,
tnmd, tst, bmp2, bmp4, fgf10,  xxxg792xxx ,  xxxg838xxx , and msx1
(table 8).
 xxxd1667xxx -induced changes in gene expression at
15 h post-dose gd 14 were suggested for 21 genes by
microarray (table 7). the following genes were subsequently selected from the microarray gene list for
confirmation by qrt-pcr (table 1): gpnmb,  xxxg127xxx ,
 xxxg1323xxx , ntrk,  xxxg21xxx , gsbs, and tst. with the exception of
 xxxg1323xxx , the qrt-pcr data confirmed the microarray data.
 xxxd1667xxx -induced changes in gene expression at
30 h post-dose gd 14 were suggested for 40 genes by
microarray (table 7). the following genes were subsequently selected from the microarray gene list for
confirmation by qrt-pcr (table 1): gpnmb,  xxxg654xxx ,
 xxxg1135xxx ,  xxxg1323xxx ,  xxxg329xxx , nfix, wif1, and  xxxg21xxx . with the
exception of  xxxg654xxx ,  xxxg1323xxx , cam2kg, and nfix, the qrtpcr data confirmed the microarray data. in addition,
 xxxd1667xxx -induced qrt-pcr gene expression
changes at 30 h post-dose gd 14 occurred in  xxxg9xxx ,
insig1, tnmd, wnt4,  xxxd2482xxx , bmp4, fgf10, and msx2.
 xxxd1667xxx  also induced temporal gene expression
changes (measured by qrt-pcr) in gpnmb, which was
up-regulated at 8, 15, and 30 h post-dose gd 14. other
 xxxd1667xxx -induced temporal gene expression changes
included tnmd, wif1, wnt4,  xxxd2482xxx , bmp4, fgf10, and
msx2, all of which were up-regulated at 8 and 30 h postdose gd 14. interestingly, all of these genes have
functions that may impact palate development; gpnmb
is involved in cell adhesion (tomihari et al., 2009); tnmb
is involved in chrondrogenesis (shukunami et al., 2008);
wif1 is involved in wnt transcriptional repression; wnt4/
5a is involved in patterning and cell fate during
embryogenesis (tomilson et al., 1997); bmp4 is involved
in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (wan
and cao, 2005); msx2 is involved in mesenchymal
differentiation and proliferation (satokata and maas,
1994; barlow and francis-west, 1997).

 xxxd1667xxx -related delay in rat fetal palate development (experiment 1). rats were administered a single daily oral gavage dose of
30, 60, or 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  during the sensitive period for palate development (gds 11 to 14) and a subset was euthanized on
gd 17. fetal palates were evaluated and classified as described for table 2.

mean fetal weight. given the specificity of cleft palate, it
is unlikely that these effects on fetal growth confounded
the fetal palate gene expression data.
in terms of the effects of  xxxd1667xxx  on palate
development, the incidence of cleft palate on gd 21 was
lower than that observed in other studies at the same
dose level of 60 mg/kg. in experiment 1, which was
dosed from gds 11 to 14, the incidence was 38% of
fetuses and 80% of litters. in a previous study conducted
by king et al. (1965a), which utilized a dose of 60 mg/kg
administered from gds 12 to 15, the incidence of cleft
palate was 100% of fetuses. additionally, in a study by
sturman et al. (1994), which dosed from gds 6 to 13 and
also used lister hooded rats, the incidence was 10–46%
of fetuses. the reasons for the differences in incidence of
cleft palate between these studies may be related to the
timing of in utero exposure, differences in methods of
dosing/purity of the test article, or strain of rats.
interestingly, other malformations that were observed
in experiment 1 following fetal exposure to  xxxd1667xxx  (including small limbs and phocomelia) were also

previously observed in studies by both druga et al.
(1980) and wilk et al. (1970).
based on the kinetics of palate development observed
following exposure to  xxxd1667xxx  in this study, it
appears that 90 mg/kg  xxxd1667xxx  affects palate
growth, rather than palate fusion, since the majority of
palates in this 90-mg/kg dose group were not contacted.
this potential mode of action for  xxxd1667xxx -induced
cleft palate was consistent with that previously described
by shimizu et al. (2001). in that study, 5-fluorouracil,
which induces cleft palate in rats when administered
in vivo, was found to inhibit palate growth in vitro by
altering palate growth.
in the current study, microarray and qrt-pcr gene
expression changes following exposure to  xxxd1667xxx 
occurred in multiple cell function categories, including cell
adhesion, development, metabolism, and transport. gene
expression changes with known effects on palate development included  xxxd2482xxx  and downstream genes, or genes
that exhibited an overlapped expression domain in the
palate with  xxxd2482xxx , including bmp2, bmp4, msx1, fgf10,

number indicates fold changes in gene expression per litter of
the  xxxd1667xxx -dosed group over the control group.

 xxxg792xxx , and insig1. although the magnitude of gene
expression changes was relatively small (generally ranging
between 1.5- and 2-fold), these changes were considered
biologically significant; other investigators have shown
that small changes in gene expression can have significant

effects on the embryonic development (turner et al., 2003).
interestingly, the temporal gene expression level of each of
these genes at 8, 15, and 30 h post-dose gd 14 in the
treated and control groups was similar, based on the
threshold cycle number (data not shown).
besides cleft palate,  xxxd1667xxx  also induced limb
and digit fetal defects. the aberrant gene expression of
wnt, bmp, fgf, and msx in the palate was also consistent
with the observation that perturbation of these signaling
pathways is involved in limb and digit development
(lallemand et al., 2009). the appropriate temporal and
spatial expression of shh is crucial for normal limb bud
patterning, and subtle modifications have important
phenotypic consequences. increased expression of bmp
negatively regulates shh, and bmp-dependent downregulation of shh is achieved by interfering with fgf and
wnt signaling activities that maintain shh expression
(bastida et al., 2009).
the wnt family genes are involved in patterning cell
fate during embryonic development, cell differentiation
(tomlinson et al., 1997; zhang and carthew 1998), and
 xxxd2482xxx  knockout in mice leads to cleft palate (he et al.,
2008). microarray data in wildtype mice demonstrated
that  xxxd2482xxx  mrna was expressed in a graded fashion
along the anterior versus posterior region of the e13.5
palatal shelves (higher levels in the anterior region; he
et al., 2008). in a study by brown et al. (2003),  xxxd2482xxx 
microarray gene expression was increased in mouse
palatal shelves prior to fusion. in the current study, the
palatal shelves were also analyzed prior to fusion and
 xxxd2482xxx  palate gene expression increased relative to
control in  xxxd1667xxx -exposed fetuses. this  xxxd1667xxx -induced increase in  xxxd2482xxx  mrna expression
may have been due to compensatory up-regulation
associated with signal degradation post-transcription or
perturbation of the graded mrna expression that occurs
along the palatal shelves.
the bmp signaling pathway has been shown to
regulate diverse cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis
(reviewed by wan and cao, 2005). bmp2 and bmp4 gene
expression occurs in dynamic and distinct spatial

gene expression in rat palate development
patterns in the chick facial primordia (barlow and
francis-west, 1997; francis-west et al., 1994), with
reduction or enhancement of bmp signaling resulting in
craniofacial defects such as altered facial shape, size, and
lip fusion (ashique et al., 2002; helms et al., 2005). bmp4
knockout mice also exhibit craniofacial anomalies,
including those of the palate and early facial primordial
(reviewed by nie et al., 2006). in the current study,
 xxxd1667xxx -exposed fetuses exhibited an increase in
bmp2 and bmp4 gene expression, which may have been
due to compensatory up-regulation feedback associated
with signal degradation post-transcription or due to
alteration of temporal gene expression relative to palate
collection, given that spatial and temporal changes in
bmp4 gene expression are required for normal palate
development.
msx1 appears to be required for facial growth;
heterozygous loss of function of the msx1 gene has been
associated with cleft lip and cleft palate in humans (van
den boogaard et al., 2000) and cleft palate in mice
(satokata and maas, 1994). msx1 / mice have shortened
mandibles and abnormal palatal mesenchyme proliferation (satokata and maas, 1994; zhang et al., 2002). in the
current study, msx1 gene expression increased in fetuses
exposed to  xxxd1667xxx , which is consistent with the
increased bmp4 gene expression, since both genes
function through a common pathway.
mutations in  xxxg792xxx  and twist (transcription factors
involved in fgf signaling), result in a high incidence of
cleft palate (rice et al., 2000; wilkie et al., 2001). in mice,
fgf10 / and  xxxg792xxx  / mice also exhibited cleft palate,
due to a severe reduction in cell proliferation prior to
shelf elevation (rice et al., 2004). additionally, fgf
expression decreased with palate shelf elevation and
fusion. in the current study, fgf10 and  xxxg792xxx  mrna
expression were increased following exposure to  xxxd1667xxx . this suggests transcription and translation
were disconnected, since  xxxd1667xxx  delayed palate
growth rather than stimulating it. a plausible explanation for this effect is that fgf10/ xxxg792xxx  signaling could act
not only as a proliferative factor, but also as a cell
survival factor, which has also been suggested by other
investigators (rice et al., 2004).
insig1 is a regulatory protein that restricts cholesterol
synthesis by enhancing degradation of hmg-coa
reductase. insig1 / mice exhibited cleft palate, presumably due to the build-up of sterol intermediates, since
treatment of these pregnant mutant dams with lovastatin
reduced the incidence of cleft palate (engelking et al.,
2006). in the current study, insig1 mrna expression was
increased following exposure to  xxxd1667xxx .
to our knowledge, this is the first experiment that
demonstrated the palatal stages of development and gene
expression changes associated with  xxxd1667xxx . this
experiment also demonstrated that administration of
chlorcylizine resulted in delayed early palate development,
and ultimately cleft palate at term. furthermore, this
experiment illustrated that subtle perturbation of wnt,
bmp, and fgf gene expression patterns during early palate
development occurs following exposure to  xxxd1667xxx ,
and that these changes may have profound consequences
at term (i.e., cleft palate). however, additional studies are
required to determine if  xxxd1667xxx -induced changes in
gene expression are associated with altered protein
expression and/or function in the developing palate.
