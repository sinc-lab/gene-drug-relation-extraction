reportedly decrease spontaneous apoptosis of peripheral blood eosinophils; however, its signaling pathway is unknown. survival signals
can be elicited by the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
( xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx ) and akt, both of which are known to be potent regulators of
apoptosis, and akt in turn inactivates forkhead transcription factors,
including  xxxg812xxx  ( xxxg812xxx ). we have investigated the effect of ␤-agonists on apoptosis of local eosinophils
isolated from the airways and the involvement of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx , akt, and
 xxxg812xxx  in its survival signal. eosinophils obtained from immunized
mice by bronchoalveolar lavage after allergen provocation underwent
apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. incubation of eosinophils with
 xxxd2401xxx  or  xxxd2155xxx  dose-dependently inhibited both spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis and apoptosis induced by fas receptor
activation. incubation with camp or  xxxd1742xxx  also inhibited eosinophil apoptosis. the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  inhibitors  xxxd3536xxx  and  xxxd2523xxx  and
an akt inhibitor, 1-l-6-hydroxymethyl- xxxd2360xxx  2-(r)-2-omethyl-3-o-octadecylcarbonate, but not a mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx , blocked  xxxd2401xxx -mediated
eosinophil survival.  xxxd3536xxx  also inhibited camp-mediated eosinophil survival.  xxxd2401xxx  rapidly induced phosphorylation of
akt and  xxxg812xxx  in eosinophils in a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -dependent manner. these
findings indicate that the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt- xxxg812xxx  pathway conveys a critical
survival signal induced by ␤-agonists in airway eosinophils.
granulocyte; protein kinase; lung; asthma
eosinophilic inflammation in the airways is an important
pathological feature of allergic asthma. the severity of asthma
is correlated with the degree of airway eosinophilia (3). eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma by releasing
inflammatory mediators and toxic products, including oxygen
free radicals and major basic protein, which can damage the
airway epithelium and increase airway hyperresponsiveness
(46). because blood and tissue eosinophilia are related to
delayed apoptosis of these cells (48, 55), it is important to
study antiapoptotic signals in eosinophils.
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx ) and its downstream
effector akt (also called  xxxg118xxx   xxxg1890xxx ) regulate a diverse

array of cellular events (5, 13), including cell survival of
various types of cells, including neutrophils and monocytes
(29, 31). the effect of akt on cell-survival responses is
mediated by the regulation of forkhead transcription factors
[ xxxg812xxx  ( xxxg812xxx ),  xxxg812xxx -l1 (fkhrlike 1), afx (acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 fused gene from
chromosome x)], now referred to as  xxxg812xxx , foxo3, and foxo4
(2, 6, 27). the role of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  in eosinophil survival is unclear.
although cytokines such as interleukin (il)-3,  xxxg1180xxx , and  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf) inhibit apoptosis of human peripheral blood (24, 56) and murine
lung (51) eosinophils,  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  is reportedly not involved in
gm-csf-induced antiapoptotic signals in eosinophils (38).
however,  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  in eosinophils regulates the respiratory burst
by opsonized particles, cytokine-mediated fc receptor activation, and  xxxg1180xxx -induced mobilization from the bone marrow (4,
11, 40). thus the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  pathway appears to play an important
role in modulating eosinophil function.
the camp-dependent signaling transduction pathway also
modulates apoptosis in a wide variety of cells. specific activation of appropriate g-protein-coupled receptors, such as the
␤2-adrenergic receptor, followed by adenylate cyclase activation, leads to production of camp, leading in turn to activation
of  xxxg1836xxx , which then phosphorylates several target
proteins (15). the signaling mechanism used by camp to
control apoptosis is likely to be complex and cell type specific.
for example, in contrast to inducing apoptosis in thymocytes
(37), camp delays apoptosis in neutrophils (35, 41, 43) and
eosinophils (8, 22, 42, 57). recent findings suggest that there
is cross-talk between the camp-dependent signaling pathway
and the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  pathway (7, 9, 30, 54). the molecular mechanisms underlying camp-mediated modulation of apoptosis in
eosinophils remain to be elucidated.
␤2-adrenoceptor agonists are effective bronchodilators for
relief of acute bronchospasm in asthma; however, their regular
use is associated with increased airway hyperresponsiveness
and allergen-induced airway response (10, 52). one possible
mechanism underlying these adverse effects could be inhibition of apoptotic clearance of eosinophils, resulting in increased inflammatory responses (28). an increase in airway
eosinophils was demonstrated after regular treatment with
inhaled ␤2-agonist (1, 20, 34). ␤2-agonists decrease spontaneous apoptosis of eosinophils isolated from human peripheral
blood (28, 39). different apoptotic responses have been rethe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment

eosinophil apoptosis and  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt

ported between peripheral blood eosinophils and lung eosinophils (45). therefore, using eosinophils isolated from murine
airways, we directed this study at determining the effect of
␤-agonists on apoptosis of eosinophils and the role of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  and
akt in this signaling pathway. few studies have examined the
regulation of forkhead transcription factors in eosinophils. we
also studied the involvement  xxxg812xxx , one of the possible
downstream targets of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  and akt, in the survival signal
induced by ␤-agonists in eosinophils.
materials and methods

induction and purification of lung eosinophils. for induction of
lung eosinophilia, 6- to 8-wk-old male balb/c mice were sensitized
by intraperitoneal injection of 10 ␮g of ovalbumin in 0.2 ml of alum
(alu-gel-s; serva, heidelberg, germany) on day 0 and day 10. mice
were then challenged with an aerosol of 5% ovalbumin for 20 min
daily between days 19 and 24, as reported previously (33). forty-eight
hours after the final challenge, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg), and the tracheas were cannulated via
tracheostomy. bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by three re-

peated lavages with dmem containing 5% fetal calf serum,  xxxd26xxx  (50 ␮m), hepes (10 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin
(100 u/ml and 0.1 mg/ml) at 25 cmh2o. the experimental protocol
was approved by the committee on animal research (faculty of
medicine, kyushu university, fukuoka, japan). the 48-h time point
was chosen because there is a peak in eosinophil infiltration (33) with
⬍1% neutrophils and ⬍9% lymphocytes, thus allowing eosinophils to
be purified. the lavage fluid was collected and incubated for 30 min
to remove macrophages from the cell suspension by adherence to plastic.
eosinophil cultures. harvested cells (1 ⫻ 106 cells/well) were
cultured in 24-well plates either in culture medium alone or in the
presence of  xxxd2401xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx , 8-bromoadenosine-camp ( xxxd595xxx -camp),  xxxd1742xxx , hamster anti-mouse fas monoclonal antibody
(clone jo-2), or gm-csf. an inhibitor of  xxxg68xxx ⬘,5⬘ xxxd929xxx  (dda) or pertussis toxin was added 30 min or 3 h,
respectively, before  xxxd2401xxx . to determine whether the activation of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx , akt, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(mek) is involved in the effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on apoptosis, eosinophils were pretreated with  xxxd3536xxx ,  xxxd2523xxx , 1-l-6-hydroxymethyl- xxxd2360xxx  2-(r)-2-o-methyl-3-o-octadecylcarbonate, or
 xxxd1169xxx  for 30 min and then exposed to  xxxd2401xxx .

assessment of apoptosis. apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. forward and side scatters were used to exclude cellular fragments and lymphocytes by flow cytometry, and the purity of eosinophils was confirmed to be more than 99% by cell sorting and staining
cytospin preparations with diff-quik (baxter, mcgaw park, il).
facscan analysis was performed with an  xxxg166xxx -fitc apoptosis
detection kit (bd pharmingen, san diego, ca) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, after incubation, cells were harvested, washed, and resupended in  xxxg166xxx  binding buffer. cells
were then stained with  xxxg166xxx  and  xxxd3027xxx  (pi) at room
temperature for 15 min in the dark. the samples were stored in the
dark and analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h.  xxxg166xxx -fitc and
pi were analyzed by flow cytometry.  xxxg166xxx -fitc was analyzed
with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 535 nm. pi was
analyzed with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 575 nm.
the exposure of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane has been shown to be a sensitive marker of early phases of
apoptosis in eosinophils (53) and other cell types, and  xxxg166xxx  bind
in a phosphatidylserine-specific manner. viable cells with intact
membranes exclude pi, whereas membranes of dead cells are permeable to pi, which binds to the cellular dna. cells that stained with pi
were excluded from apoptosis. in mouse eosinophils, the annexin
v-pi binding assay ( xxxg166xxx ⫹, pi⫺) for apoptosis had been confirmed by electron microscopic studies (16).
western blotting. phosphorylation of akt or  xxxg812xxx  was assessed
by western blot analysis as described previously (32). eosinophils
were incubated under appropriate conditions and then were lysed in
200 ␮l of ice-cold lysis buffer [50 mm tris 䡠 hcl, 0.1 mm edta, 0.1
mm egta, 1% (vol/vol) nonidet p-40, 0.1% sds, 0.1% deoxycholic
acid, 20 mm naf, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium
orthovanadate, 1 mm  xxxd502xxx , 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml
leupeptin]. the unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation
for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. samples were then boiled for 5 min with
2⫻ sds sample buffer. the boiled supernatants were electrophoresed
on sds-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to pvdf membrane.
membranes were blocked by 2-h incubation in tris-buffered saline
(10 mm tris, ph 7.5, 100 mm nacl) containing 0.1% (vol/vol)
tween 20 and 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk followed by 2-h incubation
at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-akt-ser473, anti-akt, anti- xxxg812xxx , anti- phospho- xxxg812xxx - ser-256 antibodies

(cell signaling technology, beverly, ma). the filters were washed
extensively in tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (vol/vol) tween
20 before incubation for 1 h with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. membranes were then washed and
developed with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (amersham,

results

spontaneous apoptosis of airway eosinophils. double labeling of eosinophils with  xxxg166xxx -fitc and pi enables differentiation between viable nonapoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫺, pi⫺),
viable early apoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫹, pi⫺), and late apoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫹, pi⫹). pi uptake,  xxxg166xxx -fitc
staining, and trypan blue exclusion revealed that ⬎98% of
eosinophils were viable and nonapoptotic after purification.
 xxxg166xxx -positive eosinophils were increased after incubation in medium alone, and viable nonapoptotic cells were
decreased in a time-dependent manner (fig. 1a, left). approximately 38% of the cells were  xxxg166xxx  positive but pi
negative after 24 h of culture (fig. 1b, bottom right), and this
fluorescence profile is compatible with early apoptosis. to
confirm eosinophil apoptosis by morphological analysis, eosinophils were stained with wright-giemsa staining and examined under light microscopy. classic apoptotic morphology
was shown as nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation (data not
shown). however, by 48 h, this profile changed to reflect the
additional appearance of pi-positive, late-apoptotic cells in the
cell population (fig. 1b, top right).  xxxg166xxx -positive, pinegative cells were visible at this stage, indicating additional
cells were undergoing apoptosis. these findings indicate that
eosinophils isolated from murine airways undergo spontaneous
apoptosis. in the following experiments, the 24-h time point of

incubation was used because it represents the peak of early
apoptosis (fig. 1a, right).
␤-adrenoceptor agonists inhibit spontaneous or anti-fasinduced apoptosis of eosinophils. we then checked whether
␤-adrenoceptor agonists influence apoptosis of airway eosinophils.  xxxd2401xxx  inhibited spontaneous early apoptosis of
eosinophils in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner after
24 h of incubation (fig. 1c, left). the percentage of viable
nonapoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx ⫺, pi⫺) was increased after
 xxxd2401xxx  treatment (fig. 1d). a long-acting ␤2-agonist,
 xxxd2155xxx , inhibited early apoptosis of eosinophils dose dependently (fig. 1c, right). at 48 h, 10 nm  xxxd2401xxx  also
inhibited early and late apoptosis (data not shown).
cross-linking of the fas receptor with anti-fas antibody
induces apoptosis of human and murine eosinophils in vitro
(17, 36, 51). therefore, we investigated the effect of ␤-adre-

noceptor agonist on anti-fas-induced eosinophil apoptosis.
incubation with hamster anti-mouse fas monoclonal antibody
(clone jo-2, 500 ng/ml) increased eosinophil apoptosis significantly. treatment with 10 nm  xxxd2401xxx  inhibited anti-fasinduced eosinophil apoptosis significantly (fig. 2a). incubation with the isotype-matched control antibody did not have
any significant effect on eosinophil apoptosis. treatment with
1 ␮m  xxxd2155xxx  also inhibited anti-fas-induced eosinophil
apoptosis (data not shown).
effect of camp elevating agents on eosinophil apoptosis.
␤-adrenoceptor agonists increase intracellular camp by activating adenylate cyclase via g-protein-coupled receptor in
eosinophils. to investigate whether an increase in camp
affects eosinophil apoptosis, we studied the effects of  xxxd1742xxx , a direct adenylate cyclase activator, and 8-br-camp, a
membrane-permeable camp. spontaneous apoptosis of eosin-

ophils at 24 h was significantly inhibited by  xxxd1742xxx  and
8-br-camp (fig. 2b). we also analyzed the effect of dda, an
inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, on the antiapoptotic action of
 xxxd2401xxx . preincubation of eosinophils with dda blocked
the antiapoptotic effects of  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 2b). in some cell
types, ␤2-adrenoceptors can also couple to gi protein as well as
to gs protein (47). it has been reported that stimulation of
␤2-adrenoceptors inhibits apoptosis via a gi-coupled pathway
(12). therefore, we assessed the effect of pertussis toxin on the
antiapoptotic action of  xxxd2401xxx . preincubation of eosinophils with pertussis toxin had no effect on isoproterenolmediated eosinophil survival (data not shown).
 xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  is involved in the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxd2401xxx .
 xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  (13) and mek (26) have been shown to mediate cell
survival in many cell types. to determine whether the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx 
pathway or the mek pathway is involved eosinophil survival,
we studied the effects of the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  inhibitors  xxxd3536xxx  and
 xxxd2523xxx  and the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  on the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxd2401xxx . preincubation of eosinophils with
either 10 nm  xxxd3536xxx  or 1 ␮m  xxxd2523xxx  for 30 min
blocked the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 3a),
whereas preincubation of eosinophils with 50 mm  xxxd1169xxx 
had no effect on  xxxd2401xxx -mediated eosinophil survival. in
the absence of  xxxd2401xxx , the inhibitors had no effect on
eosinophil survival. pretreatment with  xxxd3536xxx  also
blocked the antiapoptotic effect of 8-br-camp.
to explore whether  xxxd2401xxx  exerts its antiapopotic
action through activation of akt, we tested the effect of 5 mm
1-l-6-hydroxymethyl- xxxd2360xxx  2-(r)-2-o-methyl-3-o-octadecylcarbonate, a selective akt inhibitor (25), on the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxd2401xxx  in eosinophils. the akt inhibitor
decreased the antiapoptotic action of  xxxd2401xxx  (fig. 3a).
gm-csf activates  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  in eosinophils (11), but  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  is
reported not to be involved in antiapoptotic signaling of  xxxg526xxx  in human peripheral blood eosinophils (38). we studied
the effects of  xxxd3536xxx  on the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxg526xxx . preincubation of eosinophils with  xxxd3536xxx  had no
effect on gm-csf-mediated eosinophil survival (fig. 3b).
 xxxd2401xxx  induces akt/ xxxg812xxx  phosphorylation. to test
whether the antiapoptotic action of  xxxd2401xxx  is mediated
by the akt pathway, a downstream effector of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx , murine
airway eosinophils were incubated with  xxxd2401xxx , and akt
phosphorylation was assessed at amino acid residue 473
(serine). treatment with  xxxd2401xxx  led to an increase in
serine 473 phosphorylation within 10 min. akt phosphorylation declined by 30 min but remained elevated relative to
nonstimulated eosinophils.  xxxd2401xxx -activation of akt
phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment with  xxxd3536xxx  (fig. 4a).  xxxd2401xxx  did not affect akt protein concentrations. treatment with 8-br-camp also rapidly induced
phosphorylation of akt (data not shown). these results indicate that in eosinophils activation of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  and phosphorylation
of akt are involved in the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxd2401xxx .
akt is known to directly phosphorylate forkhead transcription factors belonging to the foxo subfamily, such as  xxxg812xxx 
and afx (2, 6). phosphorylation of these forkhead factors
results in their exclusion from the nucleus and a subsequent
inhibition in transcriptional activation of forkhead target genes.
we analyzed akt-mediated phosphorylation of  xxxg812xxx .  xxxg812xxx 
was expressed in eosinophils and become phosphorylated at

 xxxd2401xxx . after treatment with  xxxd3536xxx , we observed
decreased phosphorylation of  xxxg812xxx  and afx. these results
suggest that  xxxd2401xxx  regulates forkhead factor activity
through the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  pathway in eosinophils.
discussion

in this study, we demonstrated that incubation of airway
eosinophils with  xxxd2401xxx  or the long-acting ␤2-agonist
 xxxd2155xxx  in vitro inhibits both spontaneous apoptosis of
eosinophils and apoptosis induced by fas receptor activation.
incubation with camp or the direct adenylate cyclase activator
 xxxd1742xxx  inhibited eosinophil apoptosis. we also showed that
the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  inhibitors and an akt inhibitor completely blocked
 xxxd2401xxx - and camp-mediated eosinophil survival. this
was not observed for mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx .  xxxd2401xxx 
rapidly induced phosphorylation of akt, a downstream effector
of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx , in a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -dependent manner.  xxxd2401xxx  also  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx 
dependently induced phosphorylation-inactivation of  xxxg812xxx .
these findings indicate that the inhibition of airway eosinophil
apoptosis by ␤-agonists is mediated by the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt- xxxg812xxx 
pathway.
although the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt pathway is an important regulator of
cell survival in various cell types, little is known regarding its
role in eosinophil apoptosis. gm-csf and  xxxg1180xxx  inhibit apop288 • may 2005 •

eosinophil apoptosis and  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt

tosis (21, 24, 51, 56) and activate  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  in eosinophils (11), but
 xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  is reported not to be involved in antiapoptotic signaling
of gm-csf in human peripheral blood eosinophils (38). we
confirmed that  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  pathway was not involved in the antiapoptotic effect of gm-csf on murine airway eosinophils. the
present study shows that  xxxd2401xxx  rapidly induces akt
phosphorylation and that  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  inhibitors block the survival
effect of  xxxd2401xxx  on eosinophils, indicating that activation
of the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt pathway plays a central role in the survival
programming properties of ␤-adrenoceptor agonists in lung
eosinophils. the present findings and those of a previous
study showing  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -independent signaling after gm-csf
stimulation suggest that regulation of eosinophil survival by
the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt pathway is likely dependent on the survival
stimulus.
most of the actions of the ␤2-adrenergic receptor are mediated through gs proteins and camp (23, 50). in addition to
coupling to gs protein, ␤2-adrenoceptors can also couple to gi
protein (14). although it has been reported that stimulation of
␤2-adrenoceptors inhibits apoptosis of cardiac myocyte via a
gi-coupled pathway (12), pertussis toxin had no effect on
 xxxd2401xxx -mediated eosinophil survival. camp and the adenylate cyclase activator  xxxd1742xxx  inhibited eosinophil apoptosis; in contrast, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase dda
blocked the antiapoptotic effect of  xxxd2401xxx . these data
suggest that ␤-agonists increase intracellular camp by activating adenylate cyclase via a gs-protein-coupled receptor in
eosinophils. the role of camp in regulating apoptosis is
thought to be cell type specific. it delays apoptosis in neutrophils (35, 41, 43) but induces pro-apoptotic signals in thymocytes (37). we have confirmed earlier reports of an antiapoptotic effect of camp on eosinophils (8, 22, 42, 57). it has
recently been reported that there is cross-talk between the
camp-dependent signaling pathway and the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx  pathway,
but the effects of camp on  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt activity are quite varied.
camp activates akt through a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -dependent mechanism in
thyroid cells (7, 9), whereas inhibition of the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt pathway by camp has been reported in fibroblasts (30, 54).
furthermore, it has been reported that there are survival stimuli
activating akt via  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -independent mechanisms (19, 44). the
present study suggests that  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -dependent akt activation is
an important facet of ␤-agonist/camp-regulated antiapoptotic
signals in eosinophils.
several substrates of akt have been identified, including
components of the cell death machinery, caspase-9 and a bcl-2
family member bad (5). phosphorylation of bad and caspase-9
by akt suppresses their pro-apoptotic functions, accounting at
least in part for the potent survival function of akt. however,
we were unable to detect phosphorylation of bad in eosinophils
(data not shown). recent studies have shown that the effect of
akt on cell-survival responses is mediated by the regulation of
the foxo subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (2, 6). we
demonstrated that  xxxd2401xxx  rapidly induced phosphorylation/inactivation of  xxxg812xxx  in a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -dependent manner. these
downstream targets involved in akt-mediated eosinophil survival require further investigation. clarifying the point in the
signaling cascade at which  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt inhibits eosinophil apoptosis would permit development of new specific inhibitors, and
this could have important therapeutic implications for asthma.

regarding eosinophils in the airways of patients with
asthma, local expansion of eosinophils from cd34⫹/il-5r⫹
precursor cells is thought to contribute to tissue eosinophilia in
addition to recruitment of mature eosinophils that differentiated in the bone marrow (18, 49). furthermore, different
apoptotic responses have been reported between peripheral
blood eosinophils and lung eosinophils (45). in the present
study, airway eosinophils were obtained by bronchoalveolar
lavage after aerosol allergen provocation of immunized mice,
and the survival of eosinophils was assessed. comparison of
the role of  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt pathway in survival between local eosinophils and peripheral blood eosinophils will be important, and
further studies are needed to evaluate whether the present
findings represent the in vivo situation.
in summary, we have shown that ␤-agonists and camp
inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of airway eosinophils.  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx 
inhibitors and an akt inhibitor blocked  xxxd2401xxx -mediated
eosinophil survival, and  xxxd2401xxx  rapidly induced phosphorylation of akt and phosphorylation/inactivation of  xxxg812xxx 
in eosinophils in a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -dependent manner. these findings
indicate that the  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx   xxxg1751xxx -akt- xxxg812xxx  pathway provides a critical
survival signal induced by ␤-agonists in airway eosinophils.
identifying the pivotal event in signaling for eosinophil survival might provide novel therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling eosinophilic inflammation.
