summary
1. decreasing heart rate during development is known to be
the result of parasympathetic nervous system maturation that
depresses the pacemaker current (if) by acetylcholine (ach).
however, a direct effect of ach on if has been ruled out and the
involvement of other secondary messengers, such as camp, was
verified in previous studies. therefore, we hypothesized that
reduced basal camp production in sinoatrial (sa) nodal cells
may contribute to the slowing of heart rate after birth.
2. the electrocardiogram and heart rate variability (hrv)
were documented and measured in vivo and in vitro (in isolated
perfused langendorff preparations) for rabbits aged 2, 4, 6, 8
and 12 weeks. sinoatrial node action potential (ap) recording
and perforated patch-clamp analyses were used to investigate the
spontaneous depolarization rate and pacemaker if currents.
concentrations of camp in sa nodal tissues were determined
by radioimmunoassay. relative expression of adenylate cyclases
( xxxg67xxx , 5) and phosphodiesterases ( xxxg1692xxx , 4a and 8a) were
quantified by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain
reaction.

introduction
heart rate regulation is a continuous process consisting of numerous
cellular events controlled by both branches of the autonomic nervous
system. as the fetus develops, especially after birth, the heart rate
slows in response to an elevated vagal tone and heart rate variability
(hrv) becomes substantial. however, because of ‘pacemaking activity’
originating from specialized cardiac tissue, the sinoatrial (sa) node,
the denervated heart continues to beat.1 five major families of ionic
channels are known to contribute to pacemaking across species;
among them, the marked hyperpolarization-activated inward current
(if) dominates in the sa nodal cells of most mammals.2,3
like all other ionic currents in the sinoatrial node, if channels are
under autonomic neural control. b-adrenoceptor stimulation raises
intracellular camp, which interacts directly with the if channel,4–6
positively shifting its activation voltage and thereby increasing heart
rate;5,6 conversely, enhanced vagal activity decreases heart rate by
activating ik,ach and reducing camp levels through muscarinic
receptor-mediated signals.1
interestingly, even though the if current is ‘specific’ to sa node
pacemaker cells, its expression can be detected throughout the entire
heart, but with various activation voltages depending on species,
region, development stage and disease status.7,8 in general, the if
current in adults is activated at −40 to −60 mv in sa nodal cells,
−60 to −70 mv in atrial myocytes, −70 to −90 mv in purkinje fibres
and at much more negative voltages (i.e. approximately −110 to
−130 mv) in ventricular myocytes, the only exception being human
ventricular myocytes, where it is approxiamtely −80 mv.9–16 conversely, ventricular if recorded during earlier developmental stages
typically exhibits less negative activation voltages at approximately
−70 mv.13,17–19 these observations imply that, during the ventricular
maturation process, attenuation of pacemaker activity results in a
consequent shift of activation voltage to more negative values rather
than an attenuated gene expression, later proven to be mediated by
sympathetic neural effects at a1b-adrenoceptor and  xxxg1590xxx 
(npy) y2 receptors.8 however, what remains unclear is whether
a similar hyperpolarization shift with age could also occur within
the sa node itself and, if so, what the underlying mechanism is
and whether such a shift could play any role in the slowing of the

heart rate during postnatal development in addition to an elevated
vagal tone.
given camp is the key modulator of the if current, we wanted to
measure and identify any correlation between basal sa nodal camp
levels and if activation threshold potential in rabbit isolated hearts
of different age groups. furthermore, the aim of the present study
was to test the hypothesis that altered baseline camp content in sa
nodal cells may lead to heart rate slowing, in addition to autonomic
regulation.

methods

with an a/ d converter (digital 1200; axon instruments) and analysed with
axoscope (axon instruments).

action potential recordings
rabbit sa node samples (n = 5 in each group, three male and two female)
were prepared as described above and experiments were performed at
35.0 ± 0.5°c.23 spontaneous action potentials were recorded with conventional glass microelectrodes filled with 3 mol / l kcl and tip resistances of
20 mw. data were sampled and analysed by origin5 (microcal software,
northampton, ma, usa).

measurements of sa nodal camp by radioimmunoassay

preparation of rabbit isolated hearts
new zealand white rabbits (n = 30, 15 male and 15 female) were sorted into
different age groups and anaesthetized with 1% pentobarbital (3 ml / kg)
until their hindlimb reflexes to pain were depressed. hearts were excised and
perfused retrogradely by the langendorff method using 100% oxygenated
tyrode’s solution (composition (in mmol / l): nacl 140; kcl 5.4; mgcl2 1;
cacl2 1.8; hepes 5; glucose 10). the temperature of this perfusate was
maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°c and the ph was adjusted to 7.40 ± 0.05. the
present investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the national
institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals
(http://www.oacu.od.nih.gov/regs/guide/guide1.htm).

measurements of camp were made using the bti  xxxd1773xxx  ria kit
(biomedical technologies, stoughton, ma, usa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in brief, sa nodal tissues isolated from rabbits in five
aged groups (2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks), n = 6 in each group (three male and
three female), were homogenized in 10 volumes of 0.1 mol / l hcl, centrifuged twice at 750 g and the supernatant collected and buffered by koh
(2 mol / l) to ph 6 for tests. at room temperature, reaction buffers, test samples or standards, tracers and antibodies were sequentially added into each
tube. following overnight incubation at 4°c, the antibody bound fraction was
washed with cold phosphoric buffer, filtered and dried at 80°c and sample
camp concentrations were then determined by comparing their scintillation
counts with those of control standards.

electrocardiogram recordings and hrv measurements
electrocardiogram (ecg) recording in live rabbits (n = 6 in each age group,
three male and three female) was performed by standard lead ii. the ecg
in isolated hearts were recorded using three ag/agcl electrodes positioned
in a simulated einthoven configuration fixed on the surface of the heart and
referenced to a ground electrode. the simultaneous recording of the three
orthogonal signals, designated as x, y and z, was amplified by an ecg amplifier (ecg 6353; nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) and filtered selectively at
1000 hz.20,21 heart rate variability was analysed by both time domain and
frequency domain measurements and further calculated by selecting only
normal to normal intervals. three frequency ranges were defined as follows:
(i) 0 – 0.03 hz, very low frequency (vlf); (ii) 0.03 – 0.15 hz, low frequency
(lf); and (iii) 0.15–0.4 hz, high frequency (hf). data were subdivided into
consecutive segments reflecting 5 min total real-time recording; standard
deviation of normal-to-normal rr intervals (sdnn) and mean rr intervals
were calculated using hrv analysis (adinstruments, bella vista, nsw,
australia). beat to beat fluctuations were transformed to the frequency
domain by fast fourier transformation.22

data are expressed as the mean±sd. statistical significance was determined
using student’s t-test for comparisons of two means or analysis of variance
(anova) for comparisons of multiple means. differences were considered
statistically significant at p < 0.05.

procedures for the isolation of rabbit sa nodal cells have been described
elsewhere.23,24 in brief, a piece of nodal tissue that included the ‘central nodal
region’ measuring approximately 2.5 × 3.5 mm in 2-week-old rabbits (n = 9,
five male and four female) or 4.5 × 5.5 mm in 12-week-old rabbits (n = 18,
10 male and eight female) was isolated and all cells chosen in the study were
identified visually as small, spindle-shaped cells without striations.
to prevent current ‘run-down’, amphotericin-perforated patch clamp
techniques were used in if recording,25,26 briefly, 6 mg  xxxd164xxx  was
dissolved in 100 ml dimethylsulphoxide to make a stock solution, from which
10 ml was added to a 4 ml pipette solution and the perforated patches were
usually established within 3 –8 min. the pipette solution contained (in
mmol/l): k-aspartate 130; mgcl2 2; egta 11; na-hepes 10; cacl2 5;
na2-atp 2; na-gtp 0.1, ph 7.2. a perforated patch clamp was performed
at 32°c with 2–5 mw microelectrodes and an axopatch 1d amplifier
(molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, usa). sinoatrial nodal cells were held
at −35 mv and the activating if currents were elicited with hyperpolarizing
pulses from − 45 to −105 mv in 10 mv decrements. data were acquired
using axoscope (1.0) (axon instruments, sunnyvale, ca, usa), sampled

total rna was isolated from 2- and 12-week-old rabbit sa nodal tissues
using trizol reagent (invitrogen-life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa) and
treated with dnase i (10 units, 37°c, 3 h). complementary dna was synthesised using pooled rna from six rabbits (three males and three females)
in each age group. reverse transcription was performed using random
hexamers (annealed 10 min, 25°c) and superscript ii reverse transcriptase
(invitrogen) incubated at 42°c for 50 min. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed using lightcycler (roche, basel, switzerland)
in a total reaction volume of 25 ml, containing 2 ml lightcycler-faststart
dna master sybr green i, with 0.5 mmol / l of each primer. the concentration was standardized according to expression data of the housekeeping
gene  xxxg861xxx  in the same samples.

analyses of heart rate and hrv in isolated hearts from
different age groups
reduced heart rate with enhanced variability is one marked outcome
of postnatal cardiac development. in order to identify cardiac intrinsic factor(s) capable of affecting the rate and variability other than
the well-defined vagal–ach regulation, we began a study in rabbit
isolated hearts in which autonomic innervation was eliminated
completely. significantly decreased heart rate between the 2- and
12-week-old groups (258.7 ± 10.1 vs 147.4 ± 10.5 b.p.m., respectively;
n = 6; p < 0.05) with little change in the rr intervals (1.46 ± 0.85

the existence of cardiac-originating regulators responsible for the
slowing heart rate. the hrv was further assessed among different age
groups and analysed by hrv analysis (adinstruments). an example hrv power spectrum (msec2) confirmed the lack of variability
in langendorff-perfused 12-week-old hearts (in vitro; fig. 1a)
as opposed to pronounced high-frequency changes in the
living, same-aged subjects (in vivo; fig. 1b). this result was
determined to be statistically significant (0 vs 4.98 ± 0.49 msec2,
respectively; p < 0.05).

because changes in the basal heart rate without innervation are
always indicative of variations in sa action potentials, we proceeded
to test developmental effects on sa nodal action potentials.
figure 2a–e shows spontaneous action potentials documented from

hearts, respectively; n = 5; p < 0.05), action potential amplitudes
were slightly increased and both maximal repolarization potential
and threshold potential were shifted towards hyperpolarization, as
summarized in table 2 (p < 0.05, repeated-measures anova).

hyperpolarization shift of the if activation curve
reduced heart rates and depressed spontaneous depolarization rates
in the 12-week-old groups suggest a decrease in the magnitude of
the if current. to verify this hypothesis, sa nodal cells from 2- and
12-week-old hearts were isolated for if recording. the specific clamp
protocol is shown with the data. as illustrated in fig. 3a, the currents

effect of camp on if activation
in order to test whether the activation shift identified above was a
consequence of changes in the if channel–camp interaction, we
investigated the effect of camp on if from 12-week-old cells. after
application of membrane-permeable camp (dibutyryladenosine) to
the bath solution at a concentration of 500 mmol/l, the activation
curve shifted towards more positive potentials (fig. 3b), as often
seen in the younger group, along with a change in mean values of
v1/2: 68.0 ± 0.4 and −61.6 ± 0.5 mv in the absence and presence of
camp, respectively.

2- and 12-week-old rabbits. (a) if steady state activation curves from 2- and
12-week-old sa nodal cells were obtained using the pulse protocol shown
in the inset (holding potential (eh): −35 mv; command potential (ec): − 45,

steady state activation from sa nodal cells aged 2 weeks (), 12 weeks ()
and 12 weeks + 500 mmol/l camp (dibutyryladenosine; ), with n = 9 in
each group. normalized tail currents were plotted as a function of
hyperpolarizing voltage and fit with a boltzmann distribution to determine
the voltage midpoint (v1/2). compared with if in 2-week-old hearts, a
hyperpolarising shift in 12-week-old hearts was identified (−63.2 ± 0.6 vs
− 68.0 ± 0.4 mv, respectively; p < 0.05). the addition of 500 mmol / l camp
shifted the activation curve positively with a v1/2 of − 61.6 ± 0.5 mv.

reduced sa nodal camp content in older rabbits
alterations of action potential and if activation in older rabbits or
by camp exposure suggest that changes in baseline concentrations
of camp could be one of the mechanisms underlying the slowing
of heart rate. hence, a radioimmunoassay was performed to
measure camp content in sa nodal tissues and the results (table 3)
show a gradual reduction in camp with age (0.31 ± 0.05 vs
0.025 ± 0.002 mmol / l camp for 2- and 12-week-old hearts,
respectively; n = 6; p < 0.05).

relative gene expression of adenylate cyclase and
phosphodiesterase in sa nodal tissues
differ distinctively in voltage-dependent activation. fitting tail
current activation curves by the boltzmann equation (fig. 3b) generated
a midpoint of activation (v1/2) for 2- and 12-week-old hearts of
−63.2 ± 0.6 and −68.0 ± 0.4 mv, respectively. accordingly, a similar
shift of the if activation threshold was uncovered between 2- and
12-week-old hearts of −45.5 ± 3.0 and −51.1 ± 6.0 mv, respectively
(n = 9 in each group; p < 0.05).

cellular levels of the second messenger camp are controlled by two
enzyme families: (i) adenylate cyclase, which determines camp
formation; and (ii) phosphodiesterase, which degrades camp into
amp. to examine the relative expression of both genes in sa nodal
tissues, we used real-time, quantitative reverse transcription (rt) –
pcr using sybr green dye. because the dna sequences of the
rabbit homologues of both gene families were not available, the

discussion
the present study demonstrates an association between the reduction
of basal camp levels in sa nodal cells, hyperpolarization-shifted
if activation and heart rate slowing in rabbits during postnatal development. in langendorff-perfused hearts isolated from different age
groups, we found that heart rate slowed with maturation, yet hrv

761

did not change significantly. this observation suggests that although
hrv, which is the effect of autonomic modulation of heart rate, may
remain unchanged, average heart rate could still be affected by modulators intrinsic to the heart. thus, we investigated the sa node, the
normal pacemaker of the rabbit heart. action potential recordings
from the sa node revealed several changes in older age groups,
including parallel negative shifts of both maximal repolarization
potential and threshold potential, both combined probably having
little net effect on heart rate, and a prominent decrease in the phase 4
spontaneous depolarization rate (sdr), a key determinant of the
heart rate, from 90 mv/s (newborn, 2-week-old) to 49 mv/s
(mature, 12-week-old). although multiple pacemaker current families have been recognized to play roles in the process of spontaneous
depolarization in the sa node, there is evidence that the if current
is critical in the determination of sdr.27,28 a 5 mv hyperpolarization
shift of the if activation between the 2- and 12-week-old groups,
along with a big membrane resistance of the sa nodal cells,29 would
significantly repress the sdr, as uncovered in the present study.
all four members of the if channel family (hcn1−4) are known
to have a carboxy terminal 120 amino acid cyclic nucleotide-binding
domain (cnbd) motif, by which the channel directly interacts with
camp. this interaction promotes more rapid opening of the channel
during action potential repolarization by facilitating assembly of the
four-fold symmetric gating ring from an unliganded dimer of
dimers.5,6 to date, most studies have centred on changes in camp
concentration in response to transient fluctuations in the level of
extracellular ligands or the allosteric model discovered in neurons
in which the camp interaction is regulated by changes in the affinity
of the if channel rather than changes in its concentration.30 in contrast, the present results show that baseline levels of camp in sa
nodal cells, measured by radioimmunoassay, decline as much as
12.5-fold in 12-week-old mature rabbits compared with 2-week-old
newborns. quantification of relative gene expression further suggests that this reduction is mediated by enhanced expression levels
of  xxxg1692xxx , 4a and 8a, whose main function is to regulate intracellular signalling by cleaving camp, implicating an ageing-related
change in the gene expression profile in sa nodal tissues. comparative analyses of camp and sdr reduction pointed to a positive
correlation among these different age groups, with correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.93.
the control of pacemaking activity of the sa node via adjustments in camp levels would be a simple mechanism, but with considerable physiological and pharmacological relevance. a reduction
in heart rate from 140 b.p.m. (in the fetus) to 80 b.p.m. (in adult
humans) would considerably augment the ‘heart rate reserve’ and,
thereby, cardiac output. drugs designed to target the regulation of sa
nodal camp formation could serve as a potential pharmacological
tool for the control of heart rate in the treatment of arrhythmias.27,28
although the present study provides evidence that increased
phosphodiesterase expression may lead to a reduction in camp
levels, other potential factors, such as development-adjusted energy
metabolism, merit further investigation.
in conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that reduced
baseline camp levels in the sa node are a mechanism underlying
postnatal heart rate slowing. the attenuated interaction between if
channels and fewer camp molecules would shift the activation curve
towards hyperpolarization, leaving fewer if channels available to
initiate diastolic depolarization, consequently slowing the spontaneous
depolarization rate of the sa node.
