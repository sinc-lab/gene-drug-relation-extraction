angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis; therefore, inhibition of angiogenesis is
a promising strategy for developing new anticancer drugs. type 2 methionine aminopeptidase ( xxxg1400xxx ) protein
is likely a molecular target of angiogenesis inhibitors.

methods

 xxxd2742xxx , an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, was identified from a high-throughput screen of
a library of 175 000 compounds for  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors and from a parallel screen using the johns hopkins drug
library to identify currently used clinical drugs that can also inhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(huvec) proliferation. to investigate the mechanism of action of  xxxd2742xxx , inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx  activity and
induction of senescence were assessed in huvec. to test the antiangiogenic activity of  xxxd2742xxx , endothelial
tube formation in matrigel and microvessel formation in matrigel plugs in vivo were assessed. antitumor efficacy of  xxxd2742xxx  was evaluated in mouse models of human breast cancer xenograft (n = 10) and bladder
cancer orthotopic xenograft (n = 11). furthermore, the mechanism of action of  xxxd2742xxx  was investigated in
vivo.

results

 xxxd2742xxx  inhibited  xxxg1400xxx  activity in vitro (half maximal inhibitory concentration [ic50] = 54.8 nm, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 22.6 to 132.8 nm) and huvec proliferation (ic50 = 1.9 µm, 95% ci = 1.54 to 2.39 µm).
 xxxd2742xxx  inhibited  xxxg1400xxx  activity in huvec in a dose-dependent manner and induced premature senescence in a biphasic manner.  xxxd2742xxx  inhibited endothelial tube formation in matrigel and reduced microvessel density in vivo. mice (five per group) treated with  xxxd2742xxx  showed a 60% reduction in tumor volume in
breast cancer xenografts (tumor volume on day 30, vehicle vs  xxxd2742xxx , mean = 215.4 vs 86.5 mm3, difference =
128.9 mm3, 95% ci = 32.9 to 225.0 mm3, p = .012) and statistically significantly inhibited growth of bladder
cancer in an orthotopic mouse model (tumor bioluminescence intensities of vehicle [n = 5] vs  xxxd2742xxx  [n = 6],
p = .045).

conclusion
		

 xxxd2742xxx  shows promise as a potential therapeutic  xxxg482xxx .

angiogenesis plays an important role in the development and pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer and rheumatoid
arthritis (1–3). it requires endothelial cell proliferation, invasion
across the basement membrane surrounding the existing blood
vessel and differentiation to form capillary structures [reviewed in
(4)]. the role of angiogenesis in tumor growth and metastasis is
well established, since judah folkman’s discovery of this process in
the early 1970s [reviewed in (5)]. inhibition of angiogenesis has
become a promising strategy to slow the growth of tumors and to
enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic anticancer drugs (6,7).
the  xxxd2166xxx  family of natural products is among the most
potent small-molecule inhibitors of angiogenesis known to date,
based on in vitro and preclinical studies (8). a synthetic analog of
 xxxd2166xxx , known as  xxxd1330xxx , was tested in phase i–ii clinical
jnci.oxfordjournals.org

trials for various cancers including kaposi sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and prostate
cancer [reviewed in (9)]. however, its in vivo instability and doselimiting toxicity prevented  xxxd1330xxx  from further clinical development (10–12). in an attempt to elucidate the molecular
mechanism of inhibition of angiogenesis by  xxxd2166xxx  and tnp470, we and others identified the type 2 methionine aminopeptidase ( xxxg1400xxx ) protein as the likely molecular target of these
small-molecule angiogenesis inhibitors (13,14).  xxxg1400xxx  is one of
the three known enzymes that catalyses the removal of n-terminal
initiator methionine from nascent polypeptides during protein synthesis in mammalian cells [reviewed in (15)]. inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx 
by  xxxd1330xxx  and other inhibitors leads to the activation of tumor
protein p53 (tp53), a tumor suppressor, and the accompanying

background

cont e x t a n d c a v e a t s
prior knowledge
angiogenesis, or the proliferation, migration, and invasion of endothelial cells to form capillaries, has an important role in tumor
growth and metastasis. the type 2 methionine aminopeptidase
( xxxg1400xxx ) protein is a potential antiangiogenic target.
study design
a library of 175 000 compounds was screened for  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors, and the johns hopkins drug library (jhdl) was screened for
endothelial cell proliferation inhibitors among the currently used
clinical drugs.  xxxd2742xxx , an antibiotic used in many countries to
treat urinary tract infection, was the common potential hit from
both screens. the drug was tested for antiangiogenic activity in
endothelial cells and in mice, and anticancer activity was assessed
in mouse models of human breast cancer and orthotopic bladder
cancer xenografts.

implications
 xxxd2742xxx  has the potential for clinical use as an effective antiangiogenesis agent.
limitations
the results in mouse models may not be predictive of clinical gains
in humans. also, a dose optimization was not done and the results
in mice were obtained from a single dose.
from the editors

increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a
( xxxg418xxx ; also known as p21) that inhibits  xxxg369xxx  ( xxxg369xxx )
and  xxxg410xxx  ( xxxg410xxx ) complex required for the
phosphorylation of  xxxg1935xxx  (rb1) and g1–s cell cycle
transition in endothelial cells (16,17). given its unique function in
endothelial cell proliferation,  xxxg1400xxx  has served as a target for
discovering and developing novel antiangiogenic agents (18,19).
unlike  xxxg1400xxx , which is involved in co-translational modification of proteins, the silent information regulator 2 (sir2)
family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad)–dependent
deacetylases (also known as sirtuins [sirts]) have been shown to
play important roles in gene silencing and dna repair, among
other cellular processes [reviewed in (20)]. there are seven
human sirtuins (sirt1–7), and each isoform shows a distinct
substrate specificity and subcellular localization (21,22). the
sirt1 protein is located in the nucleus and targets a variety of
acetylated substrates including tp53 (23). there is accumulating
evidence that sirt1 plays an important role in cellular senescence and angiogenesis [reviewed in (24)]. inhibition of sirt1
activity is sufficient to induce premature senescence in endothelial cells and inhibit angiogenesis in vivo (25,26), which makes
sirt1 another promising target for discovering new inhibitors
of angiogenesis.

contribution
 xxxd2742xxx  inhibited  xxxg1400xxx  activity and endothelial cell proliferation. it also inhibited angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. tumor
volume was reduced by 60% in breast cancer xenografts. tumor
growth and area were also statistically significantly reduced in
bladder cancer xenografts.

although the conventional drug development process that
involves de novo discovery and refinement of inhibitors of individually validated targets such as vegf or  xxxg1400xxx  represents an
effective approach to develop novel antiangiogenic drugs, it is a
costly and time-consuming process (27). a complementary approach that allows a dramatic acceleration of the development of
new drugs is to screen existing drugs for previously unknown
antiangiogenic activity [reviewed in (28)]. because existing drugs,
with favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties
and tolerable side effects, are already used in humans for different
indications, such newly discovered agents can quickly enter human
clinical efficacy studies using the existing drug administration regimen. for this purpose, we recently assembled a library of mostly
food and drug administration–approved drugs, dubbed the
johns hopkins drug library (jhdl), containing a total of 2687
clinical drugs, and screened it in a variety of biological assays
including screening for antimalarial drugs and inhibitors of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a ( xxxg1048xxx ) (29,30). several promising
agents were identified from the jhdl, including the antimalarial
drug  xxxd236xxx  (29) and cardiac glycosides as novel inhibitors and
 xxxg1048xxx -dependent transcription of genes that are important for
angiogenesis and tumor growth (30).  xxxd236xxx  and cardiac glycosides were subsequently shown to be efficacious in animal
models of malaria infection and  xxxg1048xxx -dependent tumor growth,
respectively, underscoring the power to use jhdl to discover
clinically feasible drugs with desired pharmacological activities.
in this study, we used two parallel screens—a target-based
screen using  xxxg1400xxx  against a library of 175 000 chemical compounds (31), and a cell-based screen using human endothelial cells
against jhdl—to identify novel  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors with clinically
feasible antiangiogenic activity. the primary hits from both
screens were subsequently validated by determining the half maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) values for inhibition of either
 xxxg1400xxx  activity or endothelial cell proliferation. here, we focused
on  xxxd2742xxx , which was identified as a hit in both screens and is
an antibiotic used in humans to treat urinary tract infections. we
elucidated its unique mode of action in human endothelial cells
and tested it for antiangiogenic activity in mouse xenograft models.

(dmem) containing 5% fbs and the genotype was verified as
described previously (32). to generate ku7 luciferase reporter
cell line (ku7-luc), ku7 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing the firefly luciferase gene (25 µl viral supernatant/ml
medium) mixed with polybrene (4 µg/ml medium) as described
previously (32).  xxxd102xxx  (bti-tn-5b1-4) cells (invitrogen)
were grown in grace insect cell medium (invitrogen) and were
maintained in a nonhumidified incubator at 27°c as per manufacturer’s instructions.

purification of  xxxg1400xxx  enzyme
recombinant human  xxxg1400xxx  enzyme was prepared using histidine
(his)-tagged  xxxg1400xxx  as described previously (34). his-tagged
human  xxxg1400xxx  was expressed by using the bac-to-bac baculovirus
expression system (invitrogen). recombinant baculovirus were
generated and amplified in  xxxd102xxx  (bti-tn-5b1-4) cells per
manufacturer’s instructions.  xxxd102xxx  (bti-tn-5b1-4) cells
were harvested 36 hours after baculovirus infection. the cell pellet
was weighed and lysed (5 ml/g of wet pellet) in prechilled lysis
buffer (10 mm hepes [ph 8.0], 100 mm kcl, 1.5 mm mgcl2,
10% glycerol, 1% nonidet p-40, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl
fluoride [pmsf], 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml
pepstatin). the lysate was incubated on ice for 10 minutes and
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000g for 10 minutes. the supernatant was diluted
in buffer a (10 mm hepes [ph 8.0], 100 mm kcl, 1.5 mm
mgcl2, 10% glycerol) and incubated for 1 hour at 4°c with 1 ml
of pre-equilibrated talon resin (clontech, mountain view, ca).
the talon resin was washed four times with buffer a and was
transferred as a slurry into a bio-rad econo column (bio-rad,
hercules, ca). the 6× his-tagged  xxxg1400xxx  was eluted with
50 mm imidazole in buffer a, and fractions were collected. the
amount and purity of recombinant  xxxg1400xxx  were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm by ultrospec 2100 spectrophotometer (ge healthcare, pittsburgh, pa) and sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page).

h-thymidine incorporation assay
for the screening of drugs that inhibited huvec proliferation,
10 mm stock solutions of the jhdl were arrayed in 96-well plates,
and a final concentration of 10 µm was used for the screening.
huvec (5000 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates containing 0.2 ml of egm-2 medium and allowed to adhere at 37°c for
24 hours. the cells were then treated with 10 µm of each drug from
the jhdl for 24 hours. cells were pulsed with 1 µci 3h-thymidine
(6.7 ci per m mol) (mp biomedicals, solon, oh) for 8 hours, and
then treated with 1× trypsin- edta (invitrogen). the suspended
cells were harvested onto filtermat a glass fiber filters (wallac,
turku, finland) using the harvester 96 cell harvester (tomtec,
hamden, ct), and 3h-thymidine counts were determined using a
microbeta plate reader (perkin elmer, waltham, ma). the ic50
value of  xxxd2742xxx  was determined using six different concentrations
(0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 50 µm) from four independent experiments.

high-throughput screening for  xxxg1400xxx  inhibitors
a chemical library was constructed with 175 000 compounds that
were provided by asdi, inc (newark, de) or purchased from
maybridge (trevillet, uk), bionet (cornwall, uk), and sigmaaldrich. the compounds were dissolved in 100%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso), and stored at 20°c, as described previously (31).
compounds arrayed in 384-well plate (nunc, roskilde, denmark),
 xxxd1891xxx  µm final concentration, were screened using the map-c2
microplate processor (titertek, huntsville, al) for dispensing
reagents, and a microplate reader (bmg labtech, offenburg,
germany) for data collection.  xxxg1400xxx  was incubated with test
compounds in 45 µl assay buffer (20 mm hepes [ph 7.5], 40 mm
kcl, and 10 µm mncl2) at room temperature for 20 minutes. the
enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of 5 µl of 6 mm
methionylprolyl-p-nitroanilide (met-pro-pna) in assay buffer
together with 0.005 units of  xxxg1301xxx  as described
previously (35). absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at 30 minutes.
the percentage of net decrease in the absorbance in comparison
with control wells with solvent carrier was taken as the percentage
of inhibition by a given compound tested. compounds that exhibited more than 50% inhibition were selected for further screening;
this cutoff value was based on many published articles (29–31).
the preliminary hits were rescreened at three different concentrations (30, 10, and 3 µm), and the relative potency was compared
and used to rank the hits. the ic50 value of  xxxd2742xxx  was determined using six different concentrations (0.5, 5, 50, 500, 5000, and
50 000 nm) of  xxxd2742xxx  in four independent experiments.

senescence-associated b-galactosidase (sa-b-gal) assay
huvec were seeded in a 6-well plate (1 × 104 cells per well) and
were grown at 37°c for 24 hours. cells were treated with various
concentrations of  xxxd2742xxx  (1, 2, 5, and 10 µm) and 10 nm
 xxxd1330xxx  for 3–5 days. treatment with  xxxd3485xxx  (0.1 mm), a

induction of huvec senescence. cells were then washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; ph 7.4) containing 137 mm
nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 8 mm na2hpo4, and 2 mm kh2po4
(invitrogen) and fixed with a fixative containing 2% formaldehyde
and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in pbs at room temperature for 10 minutes. cells were washed twice with pbs and were incubated in
freshly prepared sa-b-gal staining solution (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside [x-gal], 5 mm potassium

with pbs before they were observed under a nikon eclipse ts100
microscope (nikon corp., tokyo, japan) for a medium- to darkblue staining, indicative of sa-b-gal activity.
expression and purification of recombinant sirt1
flag-tagged full-length sirt1 gene (addgene plasmid 1791: flagsirt1) was constructed by the laboratory of michael e. greenberg
and was obtained through addgene (cambridge, ma) (36). the
gene was subcloned into the  xxxg1073xxx  (gst)tagged pgex-6p-2 vector (ge healthcare) at bamhi and noti

the gst-sirt1 construct was amplified using dh5a competent cells (invitrogen) and the purified clone was introduced to
bl21 competent cells (emd4biosciences, san diego, ca) for
expression. the gst-sirt1-transformed bl21 cells were grown
in 1 l of luria-bertani (lb) media containing 10 g trypton (bd
biosciences, san jose, ca), 5 g yeast extract (bd biosciences), and
10 g nacl in the presence of 50 µg/ml ampicillin (american
bioanalytical, natick, ma) at 37°c to reach optical density of 0.8
at 600 nm measured by ultrospec 2100 spectrophotometer. the
gst-sirt1 expression was induced by incubating the bl21 with
0.5 mm isopropyl b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (american

index values less than 1 indicate synergism, values equal to 1 indicate an additive effect, whereas values greater than 1 indicate antagonism. because the potency of ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  on huvec
proliferation was different, the concentrations of the drug combinations were decided based on ic50 values of each drug. we chose
four combinations of the two drugs with a fixed concentration
ratio as follows—combination of 1 ic50 for both ex527 and tnp470; combination of 1/2 ic50 for both ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx ;
combination of 1/4 ic50 for both ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx ; and combination of 1/8 ic50 for both ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx . the effect of
drug combinations on huvec proliferation was tested using the
3
h-thymidine incorporation assay. the resulting data were analyzed
to calculate the combination index, and results were plotted as the
mean (95% confidence interval [ci]) values from three independent
experiments. to see how substantial the synergism was, the statistical
significance of the difference of each combination index value from 1
(combination index = 1, additive effect) was analyzed by one-sample
t test (two-sided) when the theoretical mean was equal to 1.

tuin activity in huvec, we measured the levels of acetylated sirtuin substrates by immunoblot. huvec were seeded in 6-well
plates (2 × 105 cells per well) and grown for 24 hours. cells were
treated with various compounds including  xxxd2742xxx  (0.5–20 µm),
sirtinol (30 µm),  xxxd3426xxx  a (tsa; 0.3 µm), ex527 (0.5–20 µm),
and  xxxd1330xxx  (10 nm) for either a short (6 hours) or long (20–24
hours) duration. sirtinol, a plant sir2 inhibitor, was used as a
positive control to detect an increase in the level of acetylated
histone h3 (37). treatment with tsa, a class-i and -ii histone
deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor (38), was used as a positive control
to detect an increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382).
ex527, a mammalian sirt1 inhibitor, was used as a positive control for inhibiting sirt1 activity (39). we used two different time
points for this assay because the acetylation of proteins is reversible
and tsa is known to increase the acetylation of hdac substrate
proteins temporarily (40). the acetylation level of tp53 at k382
was assessed to determine sirt1 and hdac activities in huvec.
the acetylation level of  xxxg2346xxx  was analyzed for sirt2 activity
and the acetylation level of histone h3 was analyzed to determine
sirt2 and hdac activity. the levels of acetylated tp53,
 xxxg2346xxx , and histone h3 were measured by incubation with
the following primary antibodies—rabbit anti-human acetyl-tp53
(acetyl-k382) (dilution, 1:500), mouse anti-sea urchin acetyltuba1a (dilution, 1:2000), and rabbit anti-human acetyl-histone
h3 (dilution, 1:1000) at 4°c overnight, followed by incubation
with hrp-conjugated anti-mouse (dilution, 1:2000) or anti-rabbit
(dilution, 1:2000) igg at room temperature for 1 hour. bound
antibodies were detected using ecl as described earlier. the
immunoblot blot signals were quantified using image j software.
the acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) levels were normalized to total
tp53 protein levels and their relative differences with the corresponding controls were calculated by dividing the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) of the test sample by the level of
acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) of the control sample. the acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  and histone h3 levels were normalized to their
respective total protein levels, and their relative differences with
the corresponding controls were calculated by dividing the level of
acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  or histone h3 of the test sample by the level
of acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  or histone h3 of the control sample. all
experiments were performed three independent times.

acetyl (k382) peptide (100 µg/ml) (abcam) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad; 100 µm) (enzo life sciences) were added
to the solution and incubated at 37°c for 1 hour. after incubation,
a small aliquot (2 µl) of reaction solution was dot-blotted onto a
nitrocellulose membrane of 0.45 µm pore size (bio-rad). the
membrane was then blocked in a blocking buffer containing 5%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  in tris-buffered saline tween-20 (tbs-t)
(20 mm tris-hcl [ph 7.5], 150 mm nacl, 0.05% tween-20) at
room temperature for 1 hour. the acetylated peptide was probed
with rabbit anti-human acetyl-tp53 (acetyl-k382) antibody (dilution, 1:500 in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 1 hour.
after washing three times with tbs-t, the membrane was incubated with hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit igg (dilution, 1:2000) at
room temperature for 30 minutes. the antibody signal was then
detected using ecl reagent. for sirt2 and sirt3 (enzo life
sciences) assays, an enzyme concentration of 0.05 unit/µl was
used. all procedures were the same as that for sirt1 measurement, except the acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  (acetyl-k16) peptide
(abcam) was used as a substrate. rabbit anti-human acetyl-histone
h4 (acetyl-k16) antibody (dilution, 1:1000) was used to detect the
acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  peptides. the resulting dot blot signals were
quantified using image j software and the data were plotted
using graphpad prism 4.0 software (graphpad software, inc, san
diego, ca). all experiments were performed three independent
times.

in vivo matrigel plug assay
female athymic nude mice (balb/c, nu/nu-ncr), 4–6 weeks old,
weighing 18–22 g, were purchased from national cancer institute
-frederick (frederick, md) and treated in accordance with the
johns hopkins animal care and use committee procedures.
mice were divided randomly into two groups, but the researchers
were not blinded to the groups when performing the experiments.
one group of mice (n = 5) was injected with the vehicle (5%
dmso in peanut oil), and the other group (n = 5) was injected
with 60-mg/kg  xxxd2742xxx  in vehicle, intraperitoneally, once daily.
the mice were pretreated for 3 days with dmso or  xxxd2742xxx 
before a subcutaneous implantation of 0.5 ml of matrigel containing pro-angiogenic factors—150 ng/ml recombinant mouse  xxxg2413xxx  164 (vegf164; a soluble mouse
vegf isoform with 164 amino acids) and 200 ng/ml  xxxg787xxx  ( xxxg787xxx ) (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) at
a site near the abdominal midline. treatment with dmso or
 xxxd2742xxx  was continued intraperitoneally, once daily, for an additional 7 days. mice were killed (as described below), and matrigel
plugs were harvested by excision of the plug, fixed with neutral
buffered 10% formalin (sigma-aldrich), and embedded in paraffin
to prepare sections for histochemical staining using masson trichrome staining, which stains the matrigel blue and the endothelial cells and vessels red. a cross-section (5 µm) of the entire
matrigel plug was photographed at magnification ×100 under the
nikon eclipse ts100 microscope, and erythrocyte-filled blood
vessels were counted per field. five fields in each group were
counted, and the mean vessel numbers and their 95% confidence
intervals were plotted. the researchers were blinded to the groups
during counting the blood vessels on the slides. the experiment

mice were divided into two groups based on the tumor size of each
mouse so that the average tumor volume was equal between the
two groups. the researchers were not blinded to the groups. one
group of mice (n = 5) was injected with vehicle (5% dmso
in peanut oil), and the other group (n = 5) was injected with
60-mg/kg  xxxd2742xxx  in vehicle, intraperitoneally, every other
day. the tumor volume was measured using a vernier caliper and
calculated according to the modified ellipsoid formula:
tumor volume (mm3 ) = (width)2 × (length) × pi / 6.

after 30 days of treatment with dmso or  xxxd2742xxx , the mice
were killed (as described below), and whole tumor tissues were
excised. each tumor tissue was dissected into two pieces and processed separately for immunohistochemistry and immunoblot
analyses.
mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of 250mg/kg tribromoethanol (sigma-aldrich) and were treated with
100% co2 when fully anesthetized. death was verified by an
observed lack of breathing, below normal body temperature, and
absence of a palpable heartbeat.
immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis of
xenograft breast tumors
for immunohistochemistry, the hcc1954 xenograft tumor tissues were fixed with a zinc fixative containing 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph
7.4), 3 mm ca(c2h3o2)2, 27 mm zn(c2h3o2)2, and 37 mm  xxxd3556xxx 
for 2–3 days at room temperature. then, the fixed tissues were
transferred to 0.1 m tris-hcl (ph 7.4). the tissues were then
embedded in paraffin and sliced to obtain 5-µm sections. the
blood vessels in the tumor tissue sections were stained with a
mouse anti-human  xxxg1724xxx  mab. to verify the specificity of  xxxg1724xxx 
staining, sections of vehicle-treated tumors were stained with normal mouse igg antibody (mock). the slides were then photographed at magnification ×100 using a nikon eclipse ts100
microscope.  xxxg1724xxx -stained blood vessels were counted per field.
four fields in each group were counted, and the mean vessel
numbers and their 95% confidence intervals were plotted using
the graphpad prism 4.0 software.
for immunoblot analysis, cell lysates were prepared from
tumor tissues that were homogenized in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm  xxxd3213xxx , 50 mm trishcl, ph 7.5, 1% nonidet p-40, 0.1% sds, 2 µg/ml of aprotinin,
2 µg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm pmsf) using a glass dounce homogenizer (vwr international, west chester, pa). the lysates were
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000g at 4°c for 20 minutes to remove tissue and
cell debris. the protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using the bio-rad protein assay kit (bio-rad). the lysates
containing equal amounts of proteins were boiled for 5 minutes in
2× laemmli buffer, separated on sds-page, and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes as described earlier. immunoblot
analysis was carried out by incubation with the following primary
antibodies—rabbit anti-human acetyl-tp53 (acetyl-k382) (dilution, 1:500), mouse anti-human tp53 (dilution, 1:2000), mouse
anti-human  xxxg2346xxx  (dilution, 1:2000), mouse anti-human rb1
(dilution, 1:1000), mouse anti-human  xxxg1400xxx  (dilution, 1:2000),

a 96-well plate was coated with matrigel (bd biosciences) by adding
50 µl of ice-cold matrigel solution per well followed by incubating at
37°c for 1 hour. huvec were then seeded on the matrigel-coated
wells (2 × 104 cells per well). cells were treated with  xxxd2742xxx  (5
and 10 µm), ex527 (1 µm),  xxxd1330xxx  (10 nm), or the combination
of ex527 (1 µm) and  xxxd1330xxx  (10 nm). cells were then incubated
in a humidified 5% co2 incubator at 37°c for 16–18 hours. the
cells were washed carefully with pbs once, and calcein-am (bd
biosciences) solution in pbs (final concentration 2 µm) was added.
after incubation at 37°c for an additional 30 minutes, the cells were
washed carefully with pbs and the fluorescence-labeled endothelial
cell tubes were observed under the nikon eclipse ts100 fluorescence microscope (485-nm excitation and 520-nm emission) at magnification ×100. before taking the fluorescence images, all the
samples were observed using a phase contrast objective of the nikon
eclipse ts100 to see if there was any tube inside of the matrigel
because this might be undetectable in fluorescence images. the total
tube lengths from the fluorescence images were quantified using the
angioquant v1.33 software (the mathworks, natick, ma). the
experiments were performed at three independent times.

screening for inhibitors of  xxxg1400xxx  and endothelial cell
proliferation and identification of  xxxd2742xxx  as a promising
hit
target-based screening. to identify novel inhibitors of  xxxg1400xxx ,
we performed a high-throughput screen of a library of 175 000
compounds using a contiguous spectrophotometric assay with
met-pro-pna as a substrate of metap. a total of 294 hits were
identified that inhibited  xxxg1400xxx  activity by at least 50%  xxxd1891xxx  µm
concentration. the detailed screening results and hits (data not
shown) will be reported elsewhere.  xxxd2742xxx , with its relatively
simple chemical structure and good potency (>99% inhibition of
 xxxg1400xxx  activity  xxxd1891xxx  µm concentration), was one of the most
potent hits identified in this screen. when the aza-benzenoid core
structure of  xxxd2742xxx  was compared with the spiroepoxide
moiety of  xxxd1330xxx , a well-known inhibitor of  xxxg1400xxx , we found
that the structures were quite distinct (figure 1, a).
we next evaluated the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on  xxxg1400xxx 
activity by determining the ic50 value.  xxxd2742xxx  showed a
strong inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx  enzyme activity (ic50 = 54.8 nm, 95%
ci = 22.6 to 132.8 nm) (figure 1, b). in contrast, even the highest
concentration (50 µm) of  xxxd2742xxx  showed very little inhibition
of  xxxg1399xxx  activity (data not shown). these results demonstrated
that  xxxd2742xxx  had remarkable isoform specificity toward
 xxxg1400xxx .
cell-based screening. in a separate screen, we used the jhdl to
identify potential hits that could inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. although  xxxd2742xxx  has not been approved in the united
states for clinical use, it is used as an antibiotic in several other
countries, and therefore, was included in the jhdl. among the
210 drugs identified that inhibited the proliferation of huvec by
at least 50%,  xxxd2742xxx  showed 95.5% inhibition of proliferation
 xxxd1891xxx  µm concentration, making it the 97th most potent hit (data
not shown).  xxxd2742xxx  showed inhibition of huvec proliferation
with moderate potency (ic50 = 1.9 µm, 95% ci = 1.54 to 2.39 µm)
(figure 1, c).
mechanism of inhibition by  xxxd2742xxx . the ability of  xxxd2742xxx  to inhibit both  xxxg1400xxx  activity and endothelial cell proliferation suggested that  xxxg1400xxx  inhibition, at least in part, could be
the mechanism responsible for inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation. therefore, we determined whether  xxxd2742xxx  inhibited
 xxxg1400xxx  activity in endothelial cells. one of the well-established

mouse model for orthotopic bladder cancer
the orthotopic mouse model used has been described previously
(32). female athymic nude mice (n = 11) (hsd:athymic nudefoxn1nu), 8 weeks old, weighing 20–24 g, were purchased from
harlan laboratories (indianapolis, in). mice were anesthetized
with isoflurane. a superficial 6-0 polypropylene purse-string
suture was placed around the urethral meatus before a lubricated
24-gauge jelco angiocatheter (smiths medical, st paul, mn) was
passed through the urethra into the bladder. after a single irrigation of the bladder with 100 µl pbs, ku7-luc cells (2 × 106) were
instilled as single-cell suspension in 50 µl, and the purse-string
suture was tied down for a 2.5-hour period, during which the mice
were kept anesthetized. three days after intravesical instillation of
ku7-luc cells, orthotopic bladder tumor growth was confirmed via
bioluminescence using an ivis200 imaging system (caliper life
sciences, hopkinton, ma).
mice (n = 11) were divided into two groups based on the bioluminescence intensity of each tumor so that the average intensity
was equal between the two groups. the researchers were not
blinded to the groups. the groups were treated with 5% dmso
in saline (vehicle, n = 5) or  xxxd2742xxx  in vehicle (30 mg/kg/day,
n = 6) by oral administration daily for 2 weeks, starting on day 3.
to quantify in vivo tumor burden, animals were imaged on days 7,
11, 16, 21, and 26 in the ivis200 imaging system.
at necropsy after 26 days, we analyzed the morphology of the
bladders. the whole bladders were removed, fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin (30 mm nah2po4 and 40 mm na2hpo4
[ph6.8], and 3.7% formaldehyde), and embedded in paraffin. the
paraffin blocks containing whole bladders were used for histology
sections. at least one 5-µm section was obtained from each bladder
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (sigma-aldrich) to assess
the morphology of bladders. bladders containing ku7 human
cancer cells stain more intensely than normal mouse bladder cells
as described previously (32).
for immunoblot analysis, lysates were prepared from mouse
bladder tissue using the same method described earlier for xenograft breast tumors. immunoblot analysis was carried out with the
following antibodies: mouse anti-human tp53 (dilution, 1:2000),
mouse anti-human met-14-3-3g (dilution, 1:1000), and mouse
anti-human rb1 (dilution, 1:1000), followed by hrp-conjugated
anti-mouse (dilution, 1:2000) igg. bound antibodies were detected
using ecl as described earlier. the immunoblot blot signals were
quantified using image j software and the data from three bladder
samples per group were plotted using graphpad prism 4.0
software.
animal procedures were done according to the guidelines of
the canadian council on animal care.

d) analysis of n-terminal methionine processing of 14-3-3g protein.
huvec were treated with 1, 2, or 5 µm  xxxd2742xxx  (far left panel) or
10-nm  xxxd1330xxx  (far right panel) for 24 hours. in a separate experiment,
huvec were transfected with control or  xxxg1400xxx  small-interfering rnas
(center panel) for 24 hours. cell lysates were analyzed for the levels of
methionine on 14-3-3g (met-14-3-3g), 14-3-3,  xxxg1400xxx , and tubulin,
alpha 1a ( xxxg2346xxx ) proteins by immunoblotting. met-14-3-3g protein
levels were normalized to the level of 14-3-3 protein for each concentration, and their relative differences with the control are shown. in each
panel, representative blots from three independent experiments are
shown.

substrates for both  xxxg1400xxx  and  xxxg1399xxx  is 14-3-3g (43). inhibition
of either of the endogenous metaps leads to the retention of the
n-terminal initiator methionine on 14-3-3g (met-14-3-3g), which
can be detected in an immunoblot analysis. treatment of huvec
with  xxxd2742xxx  led to a dose-dependent increase in the level of
met-14-3-3g protein, whereas the total 14-3-3 protein level
remained unchanged (figure 1, d, left panel). the use of
sirnas against  xxxg1400xxx  (figure 1, d, center panel) or  xxxd1330xxx 
(figure 1, d, right panel) in huvec caused a great increase in
the level of met-14-3-3g protein, further confirming that  xxxd2742xxx  could inhibit  xxxg1400xxx  in the cells. similar to  xxxd1330xxx ,
 xxxd2742xxx  also showed an increase in the level of  xxxg1400xxx  protein
itself (figure 1, d, left and right panels).

effect of  xxxd2742xxx  and  xxxd1330xxx  on proteins that may have
a role in  xxxg1400xxx  inhibition. we and others have previously

shown that the antiproliferative effect of  xxxd1330xxx  on huvec
was mediated through the activation of tp53, which increased the
expression of p21 protein. an increase in the level of p21 protein
subsequently inhibited the  xxxg369xxx – xxxg410xxx  complex, which in
turn inhibited rb1 phosphorylation (16,17). therefore, we compared the effects of  xxxd2742xxx  on the expression of these proteins
with that of  xxxd1330xxx  to assess the involvement in  xxxg1400xxx  inhibition. similar to  xxxd1330xxx , huvec treated with  xxxd2742xxx

enzyme activity.  xxxd2742xxx , at the lowest concentration (0.5 nm),
showed an approximately 10% increase in  xxxg1400xxx  activity; therefore,
more than 100% activity is shown on the y-axis. mean percentages of

passage 6 or passage 12, cells were treated with either  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) or  xxxd2742xxx  (5 µm) for 24 hours and images were
taken at ×200 magnification. scale bar = 50 µm. d) analysis of premature senescence. cells were treated with varying concentration of
 xxxd2742xxx  (1, 2, 5, and 10 µm),  xxxd1330xxx  (10 nm) or  xxxd3485xxx  (100 µm)
for 72 hours, and the induction of premature senescence was monitored by detecting the level of senescence-associated b-galactosidase
(sa-b-gal) activity. sa-b-gal-stained cells and total cells were counted,
and mean percentages of sa-b-gal-stained cells vs total cells from
three independent experiments are shown. error bars = 95% confidence intervals.

 xxxd2742xxx  and  xxxd1330xxx  also caused an increase in the total
amount of rb1 protein (observed on 12% of sds-page). a
lower percent (such as 8%) of sds-page allows separation of the
different phosphorylated forms of rb1; the lowest band representing the hypophosphorylated form (17). we noted that both
 xxxd2742xxx  and  xxxd1330xxx  increased the level of hypophosphorylated rb1 protein with increased incubation time (figure 2, a).
both  xxxd2742xxx  and  xxxd1330xxx  also caused an increase in the level
of  xxxg1400xxx  protein. however, unlike  xxxd1330xxx ,  xxxd2742xxx 
showed no effect on the level of p21 protein after 24 hours of
treatment (figure 2, a). cells treated with  xxxd2742xxx  for a longer
period (for up to 72 hours) showed sustained increase in the level
of tp53 protein level, whereas in cells treated with  xxxd1330xxx  for
the same period of time, the level of tp53 protein returned to that
of the untreated control (figure 2, b). however, treatment with
 xxxd2742xxx  showed a decrease in the tp53 mrna level in a timedependent manner. the level of p21 protein and mrna increased

effect of  xxxd2742xxx  and  xxxd1330xxx  on huvec morphology and

line and  xxxd1330xxx  on huvec morphology and senescence.
when huvec were treated with  xxxd2742xxx , we consistently
observed an increase in cell size and morphological changes similar
to the changes after extended passages in cell culture (figure 2, c).
in contrast we did not observe any remarkable change in huvec
morphology with  xxxd1330xxx  (data not shown).
it is known that primary endothelial cells become senescent
after repeated passages in culture, a process referred to as replicative senescence [reviewed in (44)]. senescence can also be induced
in response to acute stress that involves tp53 activation, which is
referred to as stress-induced premature senescence (45). we investigated whether the morphological changes observed in huvec

effect of concurrent inhibition of sirt1 and  xxxg1400xxx 
activities on the level of acetylated tp53
though sirt2 is known to deacetylate  xxxg2346xxx  protein, the
pharmacological inhibition of sirt2 activity is not sufficient to
induce  xxxg2346xxx  acetylation in mammalian cells (50). however, in
the presence tsa, a sirt2 inhibitor is known to substantially
enhance the acetylation of  xxxg2346xxx  protein in cells (50,51). this
is presumably because of a cooperative action of  xxxg1037xxx  and
sirt2 on the deacetylation of  xxxg2346xxx  (48). to determine
whether there was an effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on the level of acetylated
 xxxg2346xxx  protein or histone h3 protein in the presence of tsa,
we treated huvec with both low and high concentrations of
 xxxd2742xxx  for 24 hours, and the levels of several acetylated sirtuin
substrates were determined. as shown in figure 4, a,  xxxd2742xxx 
alone did not show an increase in the level of acetylated  xxxg2346xxx 
protein or acetylated histone h3 protein in huvec, even though
it increased the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein.
however, in the presence of tsa,  xxxd2742xxx  (15 µm) substantially increased the level of both acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  and acetylated histone h3 (figure 4, a). the results indicated that
 xxxd2742xxx  inhibited sirt2 activity in huvec at a concentration similar to its ic50 value for inhibition of sirt2 activity in
vitro (figure 3, e and f). when we treated huvec with ex527
(5 and 15 µm), a specific inhibitor of sirt1, an increase in the
level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein was observed
(figure 4, b). however, in the presence of tsa, there was little
change in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein or in
acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  and histone h3 proteins. these results
suggested that the increase in the level of acetylated  xxxg2346xxx 
protein by  xxxd2742xxx  was attributable to the inhibition of
sirt2 activity.
although  xxxd2742xxx  inhibited sirt2 activity with slightly
higher potency than sirt1 (ic50 = 15.5 µm for sirt2 vs ic50 =
20.2 µm for sirt1) (figure 3, c and f), it inhibited sirt1 activity
with slightly higher potency than sirt2 when we assessed the
inhibition of enzyme activities in cell culture based on the level of

effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on tp53 acetylation and sirtuin
activities
the aza-benzenoid core structure of  xxxd2742xxx  is similar to some
well-known sirtuin inhibitors (agk2, ex527) and activators such
as srt1720 [reviewed in (46)]. we conducted the pubchem
similarity search for the aza-benzenoid moieties in  xxxd2742xxx 
and sirtuin modulators using the tanimoto index, a similarity
measurement tool for chemical structures (perfect match,
tanimoto index = 1; no match, tanimoto index = 0) (47). the
quinoline fragment of agk2 (supplementary figure 2, available
online) and the aza-benzenoid moieties of the aforementioned
sirtuin modulators revealed a high degree of similarities (tanimoto
indices = 0.69 to 0.78) (supplementary figure 2, available online).
the structural similarities of  xxxd2742xxx  and sirtuin modulators
prompted us to determine the effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on sirtuin activities. of the seven isoforms of human sirtuins, sirt1 has been
shown to deacetylate tp53 specifically at lysine 382 (k382) (23). in
contrast, sirt2 has been reported to deacetylate  xxxg2346xxx  as well
as histone h3 at k9 (48). both sirt2 and sirt3 are known to
deacetylate  xxxg1052xxx  at the k16 position (49). therefore, we
performed an immunoblot analysis to assess the effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on the level of acetylated sirtuin substrates in huvec. there
was no effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on the level of acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  or
histone h3, whereas sirtinol (plant sir2 inhibitor), and particularly
the hdac inhibitor tsa, induced an increase in the levels of
acetylated  xxxg2346xxx  and histone h3 (figure 3, a). we noted a 3.8fold increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) after
treating huvec with 5 µm  xxxd2742xxx  for 20 hours; there was no
change in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) with a high
concentration of  xxxd2742xxx  (20 µm), or a shorter incubation period (6 hours). in contrast, when huvec were treated with tsa,
an increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) was
observed at an earlier time point, which returned to that of the
control level after 20 hours of treatment.
we further analyzed if the effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on the level of
acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) was dose responsive by treating
huvec with varying concentrations of  xxxd2742xxx  for 20 hours.
a biphasic induction of an increased level of acetylated tp53
(acetyl-k382) was noted with a peak induction at 4–5 µm of
 xxxd2742xxx ; a pattern that was similar to the changes in the level
of tp53 protein (figure 3, b). we also determined the effect of
varying concentrations of  xxxd2742xxx  on the levels of acetylated
 xxxg2346xxx  and histone h3 to see if any concentration range of
 xxxd2742xxx  could affect the acetylation status of the proteins and
observed that there was no effect (figure 3, b). similarly, there was
no obvious change in sirt1 protein level by  xxxd2742xxx .

because  xxxd2742xxx  caused an increase in the level of acetylated
tp53 (acetyl- k382), we investigated whether  xxxd2742xxx  also affected the activity of sirtuin enzymes (23). we developed an in
vitro assay based on deacetylation of acetylated tp53 (acetylk382) peptides by sirt1 or deacetylation of acetylated histone
h4 (acetyl-k16) peptides by sirt2 and sirt3. the level of the
remaining acetylated peptides was detected in a dot blot assay
using the rabbit anti-human acetyl-tp53 (acetyl-k382) or rabbit
anti-human acetyl- xxxg1052xxx  (acetyl-k16) antibody
(supplementary figure 3, available online). a dose-dependent
inhibition of sirt1 activity (ic50 = 20.2 µm, 95% ci = 8.3 to
49.3 µm) was observed when the recombinant sirt1 protein was
treated with  xxxd2742xxx  (0.5–50 µm concentration) (figure 3, c and
d). a dose-dependent inhibition of sirt2 activity (ic50 = 15.5 µm,
95% ci = 4.9 to 49.0 µm) was observed when recombinant sirt2
was treated with  xxxd2742xxx  (1–50 µm concentration), whereas
there was no effect on the activity of sirt3 (figure 3, e and f).
these results demonstrated that  xxxd2742xxx  inhibited both sirt1
and sirt2 activities in vitro, but with slightly higher potency
against sirt2 activity.

activity of sirt1. recombinant human sirt1 was treated with increasing concentrations (0.5–50 µm) of  xxxd2742xxx  for 2 hours and in
vitro enzyme assay was conducted using acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382)
peptide (ac-tp53 peptide) in the presence or absence of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (nad), a cofactor of sirt1. d) quantitative
analysis of sirt1 activity. intensity of each dot was quantified using
imagej software. mean percentages of the acetylation level of tp53

error bars = 95% confidence intervals. e) analysis of in vitro enzyme
activities of sirt2 and sirt3. similar to (c), recombinant human sirt2
and sirt3 were treated with increasing concentrations (1–50 µm) of
 xxxd2742xxx  and acetylated  xxxg1052xxx  (acetyl-k16) peptide (ac-h4 peptide) was used as the substrate. f) quantitative analysis of sirt2 and
sirt3 activities. intensity of each dot was quantified using imagej

endogenous substrates of respective enzymes. to determine
whether this discrepancy between in vitro and cell culture activities
was because of concurrent inhibition of sirt1 and  xxxg1400xxx  activities by  xxxd2742xxx , we used specific sirnas and small-molecule
inhibitors to inhibit the expression and activity, respectively, of

sirt1 and  xxxg1400xxx  proteins, and examined the effect of their
simultaneous inhibition on the level of acetylated tp53 (acetylk382) protein in huvec.  xxxg1400xxx  sirna substantially reduced
the expression of  xxxg1400xxx  protein, as verified by an immunoblot
analysis (figure 4, c). next, we tested two sirt1 sirnas

(sirna1 and sirna3) that have two different target sites in
sirt1 mrna. although neither sirt1 sirnas could completely
knockdown the expression of sirt1 protein, sirt1 sirna1 was
more efficient than sirt1 sirna3 in reducing the sirt1 protein
level in huvec (figure 4, c). thus, subsequent experiments
were done with sirt1 sirna1. compared with control sirna,
sirt1 sirna1 caused a slight increase in the level of acetylated
tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein; the level was further increased in the
presence of either  xxxd1330xxx  or  xxxg1400xxx -sirna (figure 4, c).
substantial increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382)
protein was noted upon tsa treatment when sirt1 sirna was used.
in a complementary approach, we tested the effect of ex527, an
sirt1-specific inhibitor, and  xxxd1330xxx , an metap-2-specific inhib-

itor on the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382). a slight increase in
the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein was noted with
ex527 alone, and an up to fourfold increase was noted when huvec
were treated with both ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  (figure 4, d). consistent
with sirna experiments, treatment of huvec with tsa in combination with low concentrations of ex527 (0.2 and 2 µm) also showed
substantial increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382).

presence or absence of  xxxd1330xxx , and the levels of acetylated
tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein were detected by immunoblot analysis.
we noted that ex527 alone caused up to 2.5-fold increase in the
level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) protein, and up to 4.7-fold
increase was noted when a combination of ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx 
was used (figure 5, a). similar to  xxxd2742xxx , the induction of an
increased level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) by ex527 alone
or ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  combination showed a biphasic pattern,
although the increased level of acetylation was seen with wider
range of ex527 concentrations than  xxxd2742xxx . to determine the
optimal concentrations of ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  suitable for detection of potential synergy, we obtained the ic50 values of both
compounds for inhibition of huvec proliferation. ex527
showed a much weaker inhibition of cell proliferation (ic50 = 9.1 µm,
95% ci = 8.0 to 10.2 µm) than  xxxd1330xxx  (ic50 = 0.56 nm, 95%

combined effect of the two compounds was synergistic by using

(41). we chose four combinations of the two drugs with a fixed

effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo
to determine whether  xxxd2742xxx  had any effect on angiogenesis
in vitro, we assessed the formation of endothelial tubes in a threedimensional assay. the huvec tube formation was inhibited by
 xxxd2742xxx  in a dose-dependent manner (figure 6, a, top panel).
previously, it has been shown that sirt1 inhibition was sufficient
to inhibit angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (52). inhibition of
endothelial tube formation was noted with 1 µm ex527; however,
there was no inhibition of tube formation with 10 nm  xxxd1330xxx 
(figure 6, a, bottom panel), a concentration sufficient to inhibit
huvec proliferation in cell culture. a strong inhibition of tube
formation was noted when huvec were treated with a combination

of ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  (figure 6, a, bottom panel). the quantitative data on tube lengths are shown in figure 6, b. the
combination of ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  synergistically inhibited the
tube formation (for control vs ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  combination,
mean length = 15 110 vs 2284 [arbitrary unit], difference = 12826,
95% ci = 10780 to 14 870, p < .0001; for ex527 vs ex527 and
 xxxd1330xxx  combination, mean length = 8680 vs 2284 [arbitrary
unit], difference = 6396, 95% ci = 4355 to 8438, p = .0010; and for
 xxxd1330xxx  vs ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  combination, mean length =
13630 vs 2284 [arbitrary unit], difference = 11 346, 95% ci = 7489
to 15 200, p = .0012).
to determine whether  xxxd2742xxx  had an effect on angiogenesis in vivo, we performed a matrigel plug assay in 10 female
athymic nude mice (balb/c, nu/nu-ncr). mice were injected
with either vehicle (n = 5) or  xxxd2742xxx  (n = 5) intraperitoneally, once daily for 3 days, and matrigel plugs containing vegf
and  xxxg787xxx  were injected subcutaneously into mice. treatment
with dmso or  xxxd2742xxx  was continued, once daily, for an
additional 7 days. ten days after initial treatment, the matrigel
plugs were removed and photographed (figure 6, c), and the
newly invaded blood vessels were assessed microscopically
(figure 6, d). compared with vehicle,  xxxd2742xxx  at 60 mg/kg
reduced the number of new microvessels by 63% (vehicle vs
 xxxd2742xxx , mean = 48.6 vs 20 microvessels, difference = 28.6
microvessels, 95% ci = 13.49 to 43.71 microvessels, p = .002)
(figure 6, d and e).

with a previous report (26), ex527 at 2 µm was sufficient to induce
premature senescence in huvec (control vs ex527, mean = 8.67
vs 23.67%, difference = 15%, 95% ci = 10.92 to 36.41, p = .019)
(figure 5, d). a strong induction of premature senescence was
observed when huvec were treated with a combination of
ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  (for control vs ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx  combination, mean = 8.67% vs 55.33%, difference = 46.66%, 95%
ci = 15.75 to 77.59, p = .014; for ex527 vs ex527 and  xxxd1330xxx 
combination, mean = 23.67% vs 55.33%, difference = 31.66%,
95% ci = 0.48 to 62.85, p = .048; and for  xxxd1330xxx  vs ex527 and
 xxxd1330xxx  combination, mean = 3.73% vs 55.33%, difference =
51.60%, 95% ci = 21.49 to 81.71, p = .009). no senescence was
observed with  xxxd1330xxx  alone.

we performed an immunoblot analysis of the protein levels of
tp53 and acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) in the tumor tissues
(four tumors per group) on day 30. as shown in figure 7, c, representative tumors from mice treated with  xxxd2742xxx  showed a
substantial increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382).
consistent with the in vitro results, tumors from mice treated with
 xxxd2742xxx  showed an increase in the levels of tp53 (figure 7, c),
met-14-3-3g,  xxxg1400xxx , and rb1 proteins (supplementary figure
4, available online), suggesting that  xxxd2742xxx  inhibited sirt1
and  xxxg1400xxx  activity in vivo.
to assess whether inhibition of tumor growth was accompanied by inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo, we performed an immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissues on day 30 using
anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibodies, a marker of blood vessels (53), to quantitate the number of microvessels in the vehicle-treated and
 xxxd2742xxx -treated tumors (figure 7, d and e). tumors from
mice treated with  xxxd2742xxx  showed a 58% inhibition of

were analyzed for ac-tp53, tp53, and tubulin, alpha 1a ( xxxg2346xxx ) by

immunoblotting.  xxxg2346xxx  was used as the loading control. the

effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on the growth of human breast
tumor xenografts
because we observed a substantial inhibitory effect of  xxxd2742xxx 
on angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, next we determined if
 xxxd2742xxx  had an effect on the growth of breast tumors in a
mouse xenograft model. hcc1954 cells were subcutaneously
transplanted into 10 female athymic nude mice (balb/c, nu/nuncr), and the mice were injected either with vehicle (n = 5) or
 xxxd2742xxx  (n = 5) once every other day intraperitoneally for 30
days. mice treated with  xxxd2742xxx  showed statistically significantly reduced growth of hcc1954 xenografts. a 60% inhibition
of tumor volume (vehicle vs  xxxd2742xxx , mean = 215.4 vs 86.5 mm3,
difference = 128.9 mm3, 95% ci = 32.9 to 225.0 mm3, p = .012)
and a 43% inhibition of tumor weight (vehicle vs  xxxd2742xxx ,
mean = 150.9 mg vs 86.1 mg, difference = 64.7 mg, 95% ci = 4.8
to 124.7 mg, p = .036) were noted on day 30 (figure 7, a and b).

effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on tumor growth in mouse
orthotopic bladder cancer model
 xxxd2742xxx  has been widely used in european, asian, and african
countries for treating urinary tract infections. more than 70% of
 xxxd2742xxx  is found in urine after oral dosing in humans as well as
in mice (54). because bladder cancer occurs within the urinary
tract and its growth and metastasis are dependent on angiogenesis
(55), the accumulation of  xxxd2742xxx  in urine raised a possibility
that it might be effective in inhibiting bladder cancer growth. to
determine if  xxxd2742xxx  had an effect on the growth of bladder
tumors in vivo, we injected ku7-luc cells orthotopically into the

wall of mouse bladders in 11 female athymic nude mice
(hsd:athymic nude-foxn1nu). three days after tumor cell injection, mice were given  xxxd2742xxx  (30 mg/kg/day) (n = 6) or vehicle (n = 5) orally for 2 weeks, and tumor growth was detected on
days 7, 11, 16, 21, and 26 using bioluminescence imaging (figure
8, a and b). the level of toxicity, as judged by loss of body weight,
showed no statistically significant difference between the vehicleand  xxxd2742xxx -treated groups of mice (data not shown). mice
treated with  xxxd2742xxx  showed a statistically significant inhibition
of tumor growth compared with the vehicle-treated mice (timecourse changes in tumor bioluminescence intensities of vehicle vs
 xxxd2742xxx  groups, p = .045). histopathologic analysis of xenograft
tumors showed that tumors occupied a large area of bladders in the
vehicle group, but there was a substantial reduction in tumor area
in the bladders of mice treated with  xxxd2742xxx  (figure 8, c).

to assess the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on sirt1 and
 xxxg1400xxx  proteins in vivo, bladder tissues from mice treated with
vehicle or  xxxd2742xxx  were subjected to immunoblot analysis.
similar to the in vitro results, tissues from mice treated with
 xxxd2742xxx  showed an increased level of met-14-3-3g, tp53, and
rb1 proteins (figure 8, d). no obvious difference in sirt1
protein level between vehicle- and  xxxd2742xxx -treated groups was
observed (data not shown). the level of acetylated tp53 (acetylk382) in both control and  xxxd2742xxx  groups could not be
detected by immunoblot analysis, which prevented further analysis
on tp53 (data not shown).

in this study, we have identified the urinary tract antibiotic  xxxd2742xxx  as a novel inhibitor of  xxxg1400xxx  and endothelial cell proliferation from two parallel drug screens. given the established role of
 xxxg1400xxx  in endothelial cell proliferation (16,17), the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on this enzyme would have explained its inhibition of endothelial cell growth. however, a systematic comparison between the effects of  xxxd2742xxx  and  xxxd1330xxx , a specific
 xxxg1400xxx  inhibitor, at both the cellular and molecular levels,
revealed substantial differences between  xxxd2742xxx  and tnp470. first,  xxxd2742xxx  caused a prolonged increase in the mrna
and protein levels of p21, whereas  xxxd1330xxx  induced a temporal
increase in the mrna and protein levels of p21. second,  xxxd2742xxx  induced morphological changes and premature senescence in
huvec, whereas  xxxd1330xxx  had no effect on induction of senescence. these data indicated that  xxxg1400xxx  inhibition alone could
not fully account for  xxxd2742xxx ’s effects on huvec, particularly
on induction of premature senescence. these observations
prompted us to search for other molecular targets of  xxxd2742xxx .
the sirtuin family of proteins emerged as a plausible candidate
based on the structural similarities between  xxxd2742xxx  and some
of the known inhibitors or activators of sirtuins (46). we observed
that  xxxd2742xxx  was a dual inhibitor of  xxxg1400xxx  and sirtuins in
huvec. importantly, inhibition of sirt1 was synergistic with
the inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx  for induction of senescence or inhibition
of huvec proliferation, constituting a unique mechanism of
action of  xxxd2742xxx  in human endothelial cells. using mouse
models, we further demonstrated that  xxxd2742xxx  is effective in
blocking angiogenesis and cancer xenograft growth, particularly
in a bladder cancer model. given that  xxxd2742xxx  has already been
in use as an antibiotic to treat urinary tract infection in humans,
these findings have important clinical implications for potential
use of  xxxd2742xxx  as a novel  xxxg482xxx .
among the seven proteins in the human sirtuin family, sirt1
plays an important role in longevity and cellular senescence in
most organisms (24). premature senescence occurs as a result of
either aberrant expression of oncogenes or cellular stress that
eventually activates the tp53 pathway by deacetylation of tp53
at k382 (45). an increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetylk382) protein accompanies the induction of premature senescence by ras-regulated overexpression of promyelocytic
leukemia (pml) protein (56). in addition, sirt1 protein antagonizes pml-induced acetylation of tp53 protein and rescues
the cells from pml-mediated premature cellular senescence (57).

these observations strongly suggest that sirt1 regulates premature senescence through deacetylation of tp53 (acetyl-k382).
indeed, small-molecule inhibitors of sirt1 or sirna knockdown of sirt1 expression have been shown to induce premature
senescence in human endothelial cells by increasing the level of
acetylated tp53 (26). in this study,  xxxd2742xxx  strongly induced
an increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) and
inhibited sirt1 activity in vitro. the increase in the level of
acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) by  xxxd2742xxx  was biphasic and
paralleled the biphasic induction of premature senescence. the
small difference in the peak concentrations of  xxxd2742xxx  between
tp53 acetylation (4–5 µm) and senescence (2–4 µm) was likely
due to the difference in the drug incubation time (20 hours for
tp53 acetylation vs 72 hours for senescence). these results suggest that premature senescence was induced by  xxxd2742xxx 
through sirt1 inhibition and increased the level of acetylated
tp53 (acetyl-k382). the molecular basis of the biphasic induction of the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) by  xxxd2742xxx 
remains unclear. we also observed a biphasic induction of the
level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) upon treatment of
huvec with ex527 alone or a combination of ex527 and
 xxxd1330xxx , which raises a possibility that inhibition of sirt1
activates a compensatory pathway that resulted in the decrease in
the level of acetylated tp53.
based on in vitro enzyme assays,  xxxd2742xxx  dose-dependently
inhibited the activity of both sirt1 and sirt2 with ic50 values of
20.2 and 15.5 µm, respectively, which was higher than that needed
to induce the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) in huvec
(4–5 µm). this discrepancy was likely to be due to the  xxxd2742xxx ’s inhibitory effect on  xxxg1400xxx . concurrent inhibition of
 xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1 in huvec synergistically enhanced the level
of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382), strongly suggesting that the
 xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1 pathways converge upstream of tp53. the
synergy between  xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1 inhibitors was not only seen
at the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382) but also in inhibition
of huvec proliferation, induction of premature senescence, and
inhibition of tube formation in vitro. together, these results support the notion that dual inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1 mediates the unique effects of  xxxd2742xxx  on huvec. to date,
however, no functional relationship between  xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1
has been reported. it will be interesting and potentially important
to delineate if the  xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1 signaling pathways converge at some point and result in an increase in the level of acetylated tp53 (acetyl-k382).
as an existing clinical drug, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2742xxx 
has been extensively studied. after oral administration,  xxxd2742xxx 
is rapidly absorbed into the plasma within half an hour and is subsequently excreted into urine. though a large amount of  xxxd2742xxx  exists in conjugated form in vivo, a substantial amount of
antimicrobially active free  xxxd2742xxx  was found in plasma and
urine (54). when administered at 5 mg/kg orally in rats, 77% of
 xxxd2742xxx  was eliminated from the plasma within 6 hours,
whereas more than 1 µm of free  xxxd2742xxx  was still retained in the
plasma for more than 10 hours. the retention time of  xxxd2742xxx 
in urine was even longer. when 400 mg of  xxxd2742xxx  (routine use
for adults: 400–750 mg/day) was administered orally to humans, as
high as 10 µm of  xxxd2742xxx  was found in urine after 24 hours (54).

based on a previous report,  xxxd2742xxx  at greater than 10 µm
concentration showed bacteriostatic activity and at greater than
100 µm concentrations showed bacteriocidal activity, in vitro (58).
because  xxxd2742xxx  has proven to be an effective antibacterial drug
in humans, the drug concentration in plasma and urinary tract
administered at a dose of 400–750 mg/day must be high enough to
suppress the growth of bacteria. in this study, we showed that
 xxxd2742xxx  inhibited huvec proliferation at the concentration
of 1.9 µm, which is five times lower than the concentration
required for bacteriostatic activity in vitro. these results suggest
that  xxxd2742xxx  is likely to be effective in inhibiting angiogenesis
in vivo under the existing drug regimen. thus, we used wellestablished mouse models to assess antiangiogenic and anticancer
activities of  xxxd2742xxx  in vivo. indeed,  xxxd2742xxx  statistically
significantly inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in the breast
cancer xenograft model. given that high concentrations of  xxxd2742xxx  accumulate in the urinary tract, it was tempting to speculate
that it may have immediate use in the treatment of urological carcinomas such as those of the bladder. current treatment options
for superficial or early-stage bladder cancers are based on surgery
with or without intravesicular chemotherapy. in this study, oral
administration of  xxxd2742xxx  showed promising anticancer activity
against bladder cancer in the mouse orthotopic model. the targeted use of  xxxd2742xxx  as an adjuvant for surgery is an intriguing
possibility because 1) it showed a strong antiangiogenic activity,
which, in principle, should prevent metastasis, and 2) it inhibited
the growth of localized bladder cancer, which was presumably
because of high accumulation of  xxxd2742xxx  in urinary tract.
this study has a few limitations. we tested only a single dose
of  xxxd2742xxx  for in vivo mouse experiments. as  xxxd2742xxx 
showed biphasic induction of senescence and acetylation of tp53
in vitro, detailed dose–response effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo need to be performed. in addition,
the duration of treatment could be varied in the bladder cancer
orthotopic xenograft model because we treated mice with  xxxd2742xxx  for 2 weeks only before assessing the anticancer activity of
 xxxd2742xxx , and a complete tumor remission was not achieved
during this period. another limitation is that we were not blinded
to the control and treatment groups of mice, which could result in
biased interpretation of results.
in conclusion, we show that  xxxd2742xxx  is a novel inhibitor of
angiogenesis and has a dual mechanism of action. through inhibition of both  xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1, it increases the level of acetylated
tp53, leading to the induction of premature senescence of endothelial cells. the concurrent inhibition of  xxxg1400xxx  and sirt1 is
synergistic, enhancing the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2742xxx  on endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. the demonstration of
efficacy of  xxxd2742xxx  in inhibiting both angiogenesis and bladder
cancer xenograft growth in vivo calls for further preclinical and
clinical evaluation of  xxxd2742xxx  in the treatment of bladder
carcinomas.
