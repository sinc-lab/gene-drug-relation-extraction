mutations in human  xxxg928xxx 
give insights into its role in methionine metabolism

abstract methylation is an essential process in the body.
methyl groups in the form of  xxxd3156xxx  are
used for the synthesis of many essential compounds (e.g.,
creatine, phosphatidylcholine, and the methylation of dna
in gene expression).  xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx )
is an abundant enzyme in liver. it catalyzes the methylation of glycine by using  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx )
to form n-methylglycine (sarcosine) with the concommitant production of s- xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ). it
plays an important role in the economy of methyl groups
in the body. the function of  xxxg928xxx  has been hypothesized to provide an alternative route for the conversion of
excess  xxxd3156xxx  to  xxxd3157xxx  in order to preserve the
 xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio.  xxxg928xxx  is also inhibited by a specific form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate. as such,  xxxg928xxx  participates in a regulatory scheme
that links the de novo synthesis of methyl groups to the
availability of dietary methionine. this hypothesis can now
be tested in man. we report here for the first time two italian sibs who are compound heterzygotes in the gene that
encodes  xxxg928xxx . both have evidence of mild liver disease.

each bears the same two missense mutations, one in exon 1
(leu49pro) and the second in exon 4 (his176asn). restriction enzyme analysis of panels of diverse dna samples indicates that these mutations are not attributable to a
common polymorphism.

introduction
 xxxg928xxx  ( xxxg928xxx ),  xxxg928xxx , is an
abundant enzyme in the liver of the rat, rabbit, and man
where it makes up about 1% of the total soluble protein in
the cytosol (kerr 1972). it transfers a methyl group from
s-adensosylmethionine ( xxxd3156xxx ) to glycine with the formation of n-methylglycine (sarcosine) and s- xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ). the function of  xxxg928xxx  is believed
to be to serve as an alternate pathway for the conversion
of  xxxd3156xxx  to  xxxd3157xxx  by the methylation of glycine in
order to preserve the  xxxd3156xxx / xxxd3157xxx  ratio (balaghi et
al. 1993). in addition,  xxxg928xxx  is specifically inhibited by
a form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate
(wagner et al. 1985; yeo et al. 1999) this is a key component of a metabolic scheme that links the de novo synthesis of methyl groups via the one-carbon folate pool to
the dietary availability of methionine (see scheme i in
balaghi et al. 1993). mudd and co-workers (mudd and
poole 1975; mudd et al. 1980) have shown that, in man,
excess methyl groups coming from methionine are converted to sarcosine. presumably, this takes place via
 xxxg928xxx . the predicted amino acid sequences of  xxxg928xxx 
from rat, rabbit, mouse, pig, and humans have been determined from the nucleotide sequence of their respective
cdnas (ogawa et al. 1993).
a recent study has suggested that two italian sibs have
defective  xxxg928xxx  activity (mudd et al. 2001). patient 1 is
a 4-year-old girl and patient 2 is her 9-year-old brother.
evidence for  xxxg928xxx  deficiency comes from their having
highly elevated levels of plasma methionine and  xxxd3156xxx 
but only normal levels of plasma sarcosine. both patients
have evidence of mild liver disease with hepatomegaly
and elevated liver transaminase levels. we report here that

both patients are compound heterozygotes, each bearing
the same two missense mutations, one in exon 1
(leu49pro) and the second in exon 4 (his176asn) of the
 xxxg928xxx  gene. their mother is heterozygous for the
leu49pro mutation, whereas their father is heterozygous
for the his176asn mutation. these are the first reported
cases of an inborn error affecting the activity of  xxxg928xxx .

materials and methods
patient and control dnas
genomic dnas were isolated from blood and fibroblast cell culture
samples by using the nucleospin blood mini kit and nucleospin
tissue kit (clontech, palo alto, calif., usa) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. the volume of the blood samples was
100–200 µl, and the final elution volume was 200 µl. the concentration of the eluted dna was 10–20 ng/µl as determined by absorbance at 260 nm. control dna samples came from 44 us individuals on the dna polymorphism discovery resource panel
(national human genome research institute, nhgri, usa) and
from 33 non-related individuals of the centre d’etude du polymorphisme humain (ceph) panel. additional control genomic
dnas were prepared from blood samples of 21 healthy italian individuals. before use, the samples were diluted to a concentration
of 30 ng/µl. all manipulations with dna and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products were carried out according to standard protocols for dna cloning and analysis (sambrook et al. 1989).
pcr amplification of the human  xxxg928xxx  gene
fragments of dna containing the  xxxg928xxx  gene sequence were
prepared by pcr amplification of genomic dna template by using specific primers. table 1 describes the sequences of each of the
primers used in this study. figure 1 shows their relationship to the
genomic sequences of  xxxg928xxx . for the full-size 3.65-kb gene, the
primers h-53 and h-36 were used. they were designed based on
the sequence of the clone rp1–125m3 from human chromosome 6
as released by gene bank. pcr was performed on the robocycler
40 (stratagene, la jolla, calif., usa) with the following steps: hot
start at 94°c for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°c for 1 min,
52°c for 1 min, 68°c for 4 min, and a final extension step at 68°c
for 10 min. all pcrs were carried out in 50-µl volumes of pcr
supermix high fidelity reaction mixture (gibco brl, usa). the

concentrations of the primers and genomic dna were 200 nm and
4 ng/µl, respectively.
the 1.9-kb 5’-fragment of  xxxg928xxx  was prepared by pcr with
primers h-53 and h-34, and the 1.8-kb 3’-fragment was prepared
by using primers h-52 and h-36. pcr conditions were as above
except the extension time at 68°c was 2 min. the exon 1 fragment
for restriction analysis of the mutation was prepared by pcr with
primers h-51 and h-35. the fragment of exon 4 for restriction
analysis was prepared by pcr with primers h-62 and h-32. in
both cases, pcr was performed with a hot start at 94°c for 1 min,
followed by 40 cycles at 94°c for 1 min, 51°c for 1 min, 72°c for
1 min, and finished with an incubation at 72°c for 8 min. the pcr
fragments were purified by the qiaquick pcr purification kit
(qiagen, valencia, calif., usa) or by preparative electrophoresis and elution of the respective fragment from the gel by the
qiaquick gel extraction kit (qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
sequencing of dna
dna was sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method with an
applied biosystem 1310 automated system according to the man-

70
ufacturer’s protocol. the following primers were used to sequence
in the forward direction: h-54, h-53, h-59, h-61, h-62, h-63, and
h-64. reverse sequencing was carried out with primers h-31,
h-36, h-33, h-34, and h-35. all primers were designed by using
primer3 software (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/
primer3) and were checked for matching to the human genomic sequence by blast software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/
blast/).
restriction analysis
mutations detected by sequencing pcr products containing sequences from patient dna were confirmed by restriction analysis.
the amplicons containing the mutations in exon 1 and exon 4 were
prepared by pcr with primers h-51 and h-35, and h-62 and
h-32, respectively. the pcr fragments were purified on spin
columns. restriction of the fragment of exon 1 was carried out
with bstni at 60°c for 2 h. the reaction mixture contained
40–60 ng dna, 3–5 u enzyme in a volume of 20 µl. restriction
analysis of the exon-4-containing fragment was performed with
bcli at 37°c for 2 h. the reaction mixture contained 40–60 ng
dna, 3 u enzyme in a volume of 20 µl. the restriction fragments
of dna were analyzed by electrophoresis in 3% and 3.6%
nusieve agarose (bma, rockland, usa) gel in tae buffer
(40 mm tris-hac, 1 mm edta, ph 7.5) at 5 v/cm. dna was
visualized with ethidium bromide included in the gel. a 100-bp
molecular ruler (bio-rad, usa) was used as a molecular-size
marker. the gels were photographed with a nucleovision 760
imaging workstation (nucleotech, san mateo, calif., usa).

screening for mutations
shortly after we began this study, gene bank released clone
rpi-125m3 from human chromosome 6 (gi:7634449).
this clone was identified as containing sequences with
100% homology to  xxxg928xxx  cdna by using a blast
search of the unfinished human genome (‘htgs’ option).
because the sequences of the rat and the mouse genes are
about 3.3 kb, we assumed that the human gene would be
of similar size. we obtained a 3.65-bp fragment containing human  xxxg928xxx  from human genomic dna (clontech)
by pcr with primers h-53 and h-36. the human  xxxg928xxx 
genomic sequence (gi:8671581) was recently cloned by
chen et al. (2000). we have used the nucleotide numbering of the  xxxg928xxx  sequence given by these authors where
an adenine nucleotide in the first codon has the number
1334, and the last cytidine nucleotide in exon 6 is numbered 4270. the sequence is similar to that of the rat and
mouse (data not shown). to screen the  xxxg928xxx  gene for
mutations, the pcr-amplified 3.65-kb products were sequenced on an automated sequencing system. the fragments of the  xxxg928xxx  gene containing all exons, most of
the introns, and about 300 nucleotides each from the 5’and 3’-flanking regions were sequenced. the sequences
of  xxxg928xxx  alleles form patient 1 were compared with that
published by chen et al. (2000). the coding region was
found to be identical, except for two heterozygosities: at
nucleotide 1481 with a t to c transition predicted to encode a leucine (ctt) to proline (cct) substitution at
codon 49 in exon 1, and a c to a transversion at nu-

restriction analysis
both mutations changed the restriction sites for several restriction enzymes. using the dnastar program, we
found that the leu49pro mutation creates a new restriction site for the bstni restriction enzyme, because sequence cttgg is changed to cctgg (fig. 4a). the
his176asn mutation causes loss of a recognition site for
the bcli restriction enzyme, because tgatca is changed
to tgataa (fig. 5a). these endonucleases were used
for analysis of patient and control pcr products.
the portion of the  xxxg928xxx  gene containing exon 1 was
pcr-amplified with primers h-51 and h-35, generating
an amplicon of 204 bp. this amplicon was digested with
bstni. in the case of the wild-type dna, two fragments
were generated with sizes of 21 bp and 183 bp (fig. 4b),
because of the presence of a single restriction site. amplicons containing the leu49pro mutation were also cleaved
at a second position introduced by the mutation resulting
in fragments of 21 bp, 55 bp, and 128 bp. results indi-

cated that no leu49pro mutations were found in the father’s and control dnas but were present in amplicons
derived from the mother’s, daughter’s, and son’s dnas.
to analyze the  xxxg928xxx  amplicons for the his176asn mutation in exon 4, this portion of the gene was pcr-amplified with primers (h-62 and h-32) resulting in an amplicon of 528 nucleotides. digestion of the amplicons from
control dna with bcli generated two fragments of 259 bp
and 260 bp. whereas all amplicons derived from the
mother’s and control dnas were cleaved completely, amplicons derived from the dnas of the father, daughter,
and son yielded heterozygous patterns (fig. 5b) in which
a new band at 520 bp was seen in addition to the others.
thus, the mutations in both exons 1 and 4 were confirmed
by this independent method. in addition, we carried out
the same restriction enzyme analysis on amplicons derived from dnas from 44 us control samples from the
dna polymorphism discovery resource panel, 33 control samples of dna from the ceph panel, and 21 randomly collected dna samples of italian origin. none of
these samples contained either the mutation at nucleotide
1481 or that at nucleotide 3715.

discussion
the two patients described here have mild liver disease as
evidenced by hepatomegaly and modest elevation of liver
transaminases. they also are unable to metabolize methionine normally. on a normal diet, both have elevated
plasma methionine levels (approximately 10× normal)
and elevated plasma  xxxd3156xxx  (approximately 20× normal). when patient 1 was placed on a low methionine diet
(mudd et al. 2001), her plasma methionine and  xxxd3156xxx 
normalized, and transaminase levels were either normal or
comparable to the lower transaminase levels when on the
normal diet. mudd and poole (1975) and mudd et al.
(1980) have shown that excess labile methyl groups originating in methionine, choline, or betaine are metabolized
to sarcosine, presumably through  xxxg928xxx . it seems clear
that both patients have defective  xxxg928xxx  activity, since
there is no increase in plasma sarcosine in the face of extremely elevated plasma  xxxd3156xxx  levels. this conclusion
is confirmed by the data presented here showing that both
sibs are compound heterozygotes for mutations in the
 xxxg928xxx  gene. it should be noted that both parents have
normal values for plasma methionine and  xxxd3156xxx  despite
each being heterozygous for different mutant alleles.
 xxxg928xxx  activity was not detected in extracts of leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts from control subjects
(unpublished data). since  xxxg928xxx  activity is found in substantial quantities only in the liver and pancreas with
much smaller amounts in the kidney (yeo and wagner
1994), it was not practical to obtain tissue samples to
measure the activity directly. therefore, it was necessary
to sequence the  xxxg928xxx  genes to determine whether any
mutations were present. one may speculate that, in the absence of  xxxg928xxx , elevated  xxxd3156xxx  forces the increased
synthesis of one or more methylated product(s) that
lead(s) to damage to the liver. another possibility is that
the accumulation of  xxxd3156xxx  results in a depletion of hepatic atp. such depletion has been suggested to take
place in experimental animals during the administration
of either methionine or ethionine (hardwick et al. 1970).
plasma  xxxd3156xxx  and methionine levels presumably reflect hepatic levels. the observation that our two patients
with defective  xxxg928xxx  activity have highly elevated
plasma methionine levels is not readily understood. this
has been discussed by mudd et al. (2001). presumably,
there is a feedback mechanism(s) whereby accumulated
 xxxd3156xxx  down-regulates the flux from methionine to
 xxxd3156xxx .  xxxd3156xxx  is known to inhibit  xxxg1379xxx  (mat ii), the isozyme responsible for
 xxxd3156xxx  synthesis in extrahepatic tissues. mat i and
mat iii are liver isozymes with high kms for methionine
and are believed to be responsible for  xxxd3156xxx  formation
when levels of liver methionine are high (finkelstein 1990).
mat i is also inhibited by  xxxd3156xxx , although mat iii is
stimulated (kotb and geller 1993). whether the net effect
of these phenomena is sufficient to explain the observed
accumulation of methionine or whether additional regulatory mechanisms are at work is not known at the present

time. it is also unlikely that the elevated methionine levels
in these two patients are the source of the mild liver disease since, in cases of mat i/iii deficiency with elevated
plasma methionine levels without elevated  xxxd3156xxx , there
has been no evidence of hepatitis (mudd et al. 2001).
human  xxxg928xxx  is two amino acids longer than rat
 xxxg928xxx  because of the insertion of a glutamine and a serine between proline 125 and alanine 126 of the rat enzyme
(ogawa et al. 1993). because no crystallographic structure
is available for human  xxxg928xxx  and the extra two residues
occur in a loop between helix 6 and beta strand 5, we assume that the structure of human  xxxg928xxx  accomodates this
and that the human structure is essentially the same as that
of rat  xxxg928xxx  (fig. 6; fu et al. 1996; pattanayek et al.
1998; huang et al. 2000). it is likely that both of the mutations identified here affect  xxxg928xxx  activity. the leu49pro
substitution in exon 1 occurs in the second alpha-helix of the
 xxxg928xxx  structure. whereas leucine is easily incorporated
into an alpha-helical structure, proline is the most difficult
amino acid to incorporate into an alpha-helix (chou and fasman 1974). the effect of substitution of proline for leucine
depends greatly on its position in the secondary and tertiary structure (macarthur and thornton 1991). because
 xxxg928xxx  leu49 is located exactly in the center of the second alpha-helix (fig. 6a), one might expect that the change of
this residue to proline would have a major effect on the
conformation and stability of this helix. a change of
leucine to proline is a very common cause of human metabolic abnormalities, occurring, for example, in autosomal
dominant long qt syndrome (antonucci et al. 2000) and
bernard-soulier syndrome (krahn et al. 2000).
the his176asn mutation may be even more important
for enzyme activity. this is because his176 is located in
beta-strand 6 immediately before arg177 (fig. 6b). this arg
has been proposed as the binding site for the substrate,
glycine, in the active center of rat  xxxg928xxx  (konishi and
fujioka 1987). the substitution of asparagine for arginine
at position 176 is likely to move arg 177 and perturb
glycine binding at the active site. asparagine and histidine differ greatly in the charge of their side chains and
their ability to form hydrogen bonds. therefore, the h176
n mutation should change the interaction of the beta-strand
with the neighboring peptide chain and alter the conformational flexibility of the active center. there are numerous examples of changes in the structure and function of a
protein after a histidine to asparagine exchange. in some,
the classic role of histidine as an nucleophile in the enzyme active center is abolished (yang and champoux
2000). in others, protein flexibility is changed (fetrow et
al. 1998). some of theses changes are responsible for human diseases such as hereditary hemochromatosis (erhardt et al. 1999) and monilethrix (korge et al. 1999).
 xxxg928xxx  is the only  xxxd3156xxx -dependent methyltransferase known to be a tetramer. this is consistent with its
role as a regulatory enzyme. since both our patients are
compound heterozygotes for mutations in  xxxg928xxx  and assuming a random association of the mutated monomers, a
number of different combinations are possible for the
tetramer leading to the production of a defective enzyme.

expression studies are under way to determine the effects
of these mutations, alone or in combination, on enzyme
activity or stability.
