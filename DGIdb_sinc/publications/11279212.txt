serine palmitoyltransferase (spt, ec 2.3.1.50) is a key
enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis and catalyzes the
decarboxylative condensation of l-serine and palmitoylcoenzyme a to 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. we found that
the gram-negative obligatory taerobic bacteria sphingomonas paucimobilis ey2395 have significant spt

sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane components having
a backbone structure called long-chain base (lcb)1 which is
n-fatty acylated and linked to various polar head groups. in
eukaryotes, sphingolipids such as sphingosine, sphingosine
1-phosphate, and ceramide are known to play important roles

activity and purified spt to homogeneity. this enzyme is a water-soluble homodimeric protein unlike
eukaryotic enzymes, known as heterodimers composed of tightly membrane-bound subunits, named
 xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx . the purified spt shows an absorption spectrum characteristic of a pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate-dependent enzyme. the substrate specificity
of the sphingomonas spt is less strict than the spt
complex from chinese hamster ovary cells. we isolated the spt gene encoding 420 amino acid residues
(mr 45,041) and succeeded in overproducing the spt
protein in escherichia coli, in which the product
amounted to about 10ⴚ20% of the total protein of the
cell extract. sphingomonas spt shows about 30% homology with the enzymes of the ␣- xxxd160xxx  synthase
family, and amino acid residues supposed to be involved in catalysis are conserved. the recombinant
spt was catalytically and spectrophotometrically indistinguishable from the native enzyme. this is the
first successful overproduction of an active enzyme
in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. sphingomonas spt is a prototype of the eukaryotic enzyme
and would be a useful model to elucidate the reaction
mechanism of spt.

liferation, differentiation, senescence, apoptosis, and immune
response (1).
serine palmitoyltransferase (spt: ec 2.3.1.50) catalyzes the
pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp)-dependent condensation reaction
of l-serine with  xxxd2832xxx - xxxd1739xxx  (coa) to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (kds). this reaction is the first committed step in sphingolipid biosynthesis, utilizing substrates that
are shared by other metabolic pathways, and has an activity
lower than those of other enzymes involved in sphingolipid
biosynthesis. therefore, spt is thought to be a rate-determining enzyme in the sphingolipid synthetic pathway and, accordingly, a key enzyme regulating the cellular sphingolipid content (2). eukaryotic spts have been known as membranebound proteins, enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum with
their catalytic sites facing the cytosol (3). genetic studies have
shown that two different genes,  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx , are required
for spt activity in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae (4⫺6).
subsequently, mammalian homologues of the lcb genes from
mouse, human, and chinese hamster ovary cells have also been
reported (7⫺9). the biochemical studies using the chinese
hamster ovary cell mutants demonstrated that both the  xxxg2194xxx 
and  xxxg2195xxx  proteins are subunits of spt (10, 11). there is a high
sequence homology between  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx , and they are
classified as new members of the plp-dependent ␣- xxxd160xxx 
synthase subfamily (6). based on the finding that  xxxg2194xxx  does
not have a plp-binding motif while  xxxg2195xxx  carries a lysine
residue expected to form a schiff base with plp,  xxxg2194xxx  and
 xxxg2195xxx  have been speculated as a regulatory unit and a catalytic
unit, respectively (6, 10, 11). there is, however, no biochemical
explanation for the regulation mechanism of the spt reaction
at present. the purification of the native form spt from any
eukaryotes has not been successful because of the extremely
low content and instability of this enzyme. we, too, tried to
construct the expression system of the mouse spt complex in
escherichia coli (12). affinity tagged forms of mouse lcb proteins lacking the membrane-anchor regions were coexpressed
in e. coli as partially soluble proteins, but the purified spt
complex did not show enzymatic activity. as the only achievement, hanada et al. (11) obtained an active spt complex from
the chinese hamster ovary cell mutants expressing a hexahistidine-tagged  xxxg2194xxx  protein. however, it is very difficult to
obtain a sufficient amount of the active enzyme for detailed
enzymological analysis from such purification sources.
although sphingolipids are not typical membrane constituents in prokaryotes, there are some exceptions. in strict anaerobes such as the genera bacteroides, porpthyromonas, and
prevotella, high levels of sphingolipids were found; in some
species their contents in the total extractable lipid came to 70%
(13, 14). it has been reported that bacteroides melaninogenicus
contains a water-soluble spt, but the purification of this enzyme was not successful (15). the gram-negative obligatory

aerobic bacteria sphingomonas and sphingobacterium are the
genera whose lipid composition and structure of their sphingolipids have been investigated most extensively (16, 17). in cells
of sphingomonas paucimobilis, the lipopolysaccharide in their
outer membrane is completely substituted by sphingoglycolipid, and its proposed structure is 1-o-d-glucuronosyl-2-n-2⬘hydroxymyristoyldihydrosphingosine (glucuronosyl ceramide)
(18, 19).
we found that cells of s. paucimobilis ey2395t and sphingobacterium spiritivorum ey3101t contain significant spt activity and report here the purification to homogeneity and
characterization of spt from s. paucimobilis ey2395t. the
primary structure of the enzyme has been deduced from the
cloned gene, and the spt protein was successfully overproduced in e. coli. the results show that spt from s. paucimobilis is a prototype of eukaryotic enzymes.

chemicals—l-serine and other natural l-amino acids were obtained
from nacalai tesque (kyoto, japan).  xxxd2832xxx -coa and lauroyl-coa
were from funakoshi (tokyo, japan).  xxxd3333xxx , n-heptadecanoylcoa, stearoyl-coa, arachidoyl-coa, palmitoleoyl-coa, oleoyl-coa, ophospho-l-serine, ␣-methyl-d,l-serine, and l-serine methylester were

biochemicals. the low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit,
gel filtration calibration kit, phenyl-sepharose cl-4b, pd-10, superosetm 12, and monoqtm hr 5/5 were from amersham pharmacia
biotec. deae-toyopearl 650m and butyl-toyopearl 650m were from

bio-rad laboratories. competent e. coli jm109 was purchased from
nippon gene (tokyo, japan). e. coli bl21(de3) plyss and plasmid
pet21b were from novagen. a plasmid puc118 was from takara
(kyoto, japan). all other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.
bacterial strains and growth conditions—s. paucimobilis ey2395t
and s. spiritivorum ey3101t were gifts from dr. eiko yabuuchi, aichi
medical university, aichi, japan. each strain was grown in 1 liter of lb
medium in 5-liter flasks at 30 °c and 90 rpm. cells were harvested in
the late exponential growth phase (after 8⫺9 h) and stored at ⫺20 °c
before use.
assay of the enzyme activity—in the purification steps, the spt
activity was measured according to the methods of williams et al. (20)
with minor modifications. the enzyme solution was incubated in 100 ␮l
of a standard spt reaction buffer (100 mm hepes-naoh buffer (ph
7.5) containing 0.1 mm edta, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 ␮m plp, 0.4 mm
 xxxd2832xxx -coa, and 2 mm l-[3h]ser (37 kbq/mmol)) at 37 °c for 10 min.
the reaction was terminated by addition of 100 ␮l of 2 n nh4oh. the
lipids were extracted with chcl3/ch3oh (2:1 (v/v)), and the radioactivity of the [3h]kds that formed was measured. the radioactivity
extracted from enzyme-negative control was regarded as a background.
for steady-state kinetic analysis, [14c]kds was added to the extraction
solvent as the internal standard to estimate recoveries throughout the
entire procedure. [14c]kds was enzymaticaly synthesized from
[14c]serine using purified spt. for tlc analysis, [14c]serine (10 kbq/
mmol) or [14c] xxxd2832xxx -coa (10 kbq/mmol) was used as the substrate.
the lipids were extracted and separated on tlc plates (silica gel 60,
merck) with a solvent of chloroform, methanol, and 2 n nh4oh (40:10:1
(v/v)). [14c]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was added to the extraction
solvent as the internal standard. radioactive lipids on the tlc plates
were visualized and their relative radioactivity was determined using a
bas2000 image analyzertm (fujifilm, tokyo, japan).
purification of spt—all purification procedures were performed at
4 °c. the buffer of 20 mm potassium phosphate (ph 6.5) containing 0.1
mm edta, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm  xxxd502xxx  (protease inhibitor), and
20 ␮m plp was used in all the following procedures except for the fast
protein liquid chromatography steps. the cells (30 g wet weight) were
suspended in 300 ml of the buffer and disrupted sonically (branson
sonic power, sonifier model 450) at 20 khz for 9 min. the intact cells
and debris were removed by centrifugation (10,000 ⫻ g, 40 min). after
the addition of (nh4)2so4 (final concentration, 30% saturation) and
centrifugation (100,000 ⫻ g, 60 min), the supernatant solution was
applied to a phenyl-sepharose cl-4b column (2.5 ⫻ 20 cm) equilibrated
with the buffer containing 30% saturated (nh4)2so4. the enzyme ac-

tivity was eluted with 1 liter of linearly decreasing (nh4)2so4 concentrations (30 to 0%). after the addition of (nh4)2so4 (final concentration,
30% saturation) again, the active fractions were applied to a butyltoyopearl 650m column (2.5 ⫻ 20 cm) equilibrated with the buffer
containing 30% saturated (nh4)2so4. the enzyme activity was eluted
with 1 liter of linearly decreasing (nh4)2so4 concentrations (30 to 0%).
the pooled active fractions were dialyzed against 2 liters of the buffer.
the dialysate was then applied to a deae-toyopearl 650m column
(2.5 ⫻ 20 cm) equilibrated with the buffer. the enzymes were eluted
with 1 liter of linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm nacl. the pooled active
fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against 1 liter of 10 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 6.5) containing 0.1 mm edta, 5 mm
dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm  xxxd502xxx , and 20 ␮m plp. the dialysate was
applied to a cht-ii column (1.35 ⫻ 3.5 cm), which had been connected
to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, equilibrated with the
same buffer. the enzyme was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from
10 to 200 mm potassium phosphate (ph 6.5). the eluted enzyme was
dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5) and then
applied to a mono-qtm hr column (0.55 ⫻ 5 cm) equilibrated with the
same buffer. the column was washed with 50 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph
7.5) containing 150 mm nacl and eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient
from 150 to 200 mm nacl (ph 7.5). the active fractions were combined,
concentrated to 1 ml, filtered, and stored at 4 °c. when 30 g of cells
were used as the starting material, 350 ␮g of a pure preparation of spt
was obtained.
amino acid sequencing—the purified enzyme (8.9 nmol) was carboxymethylated, desalted, and digested at 37 °c for 30 min with lysyl
endopeptidase (33 pmol). the digested peptides were isolated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a cosmosil
5c18 ar-ii column (2.0 ⫻ 150 mm) with a linear gradient from 0 to 60%
acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. the amino acid sequences were determined using a hewlett packard g1005a protein
sequencing system.
isolation and sequencing of genomic dna clones encoding spt—
based on the amino acid sequences of the spt peptides, we synthesized
degenerate oligonucleotides to obtain partial dna fragments encoding
the spt gene by pcr against genomic dna from s. paucimobilis. the
oligonucleotides were 5⬘-ga(tc)gc(tcag)cc(tcag)ga(tc)at(tca)gcicc-3⬘ and 5⬘-gc(tcag)gt(tg)aa(tga)at(ag)ta(tcag)gg-3⬘ corresponding to the amino acid sequences dapdiap and pyifta, respectively (fig. 5, dashed lines). the genomic dna of s. paucimobilis was prepared by a standard method (21). pcr was performed
using la taq dna polymerase (takara, kyoto, japan) under the
following conditions: 30 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, (40⫹ t) °c for 30 s, and
72 °c for 1 min, then 72 °c for 10 min, where t denotes that the
annealing temperature was successively increased by 0.25 °c at each
cycle. the pcr product was directly cloned into a pcrii vector (invitrogen, netherlands) and sequenced by the “dye-terminator cycle sequencing” kit and an abi 373a dna sequencer (perkinelmer life
sciences). to obtain the full-length spt gene, a genomic dna library
(1 ⫻ 106 recombinants) was screened with the 32p-labeled pcr product
(846 base pairs) as a probe. the library was constructed as follows. a
genomic dna from s. paucimobilis was partially digested by sau3ai,
2.5–3.5-kilobase fragments were agarose gel-purified and ligated into
bamhi-digested puc118, and these constructs were used to transform
e. coli jm109. labeling of the probe and detection of hybridized fragments were performed using the bcabesttm labeling kit (takara,
kyoto, japan) and quick-hybtm hybridization solution (stratagene),
respectively. twelve positive clones of the first screening were isolated.
restriction mapping and partial sequencing revealed that all 12 clones
were derived from the same gene. the complete dna sequence was
determined for both strands of the three longest clones.
gel filtration—the enzymes were applied to a superosetm 12 and
fractionated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with an fast protein liquid
chromatography system. bovine pancreas  xxxg1963xxx  (mr 13,700),
bovine pancreas chymotrypsinogen a (mr 25,000), hen egg ovalbumin
(mr 43,000), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (mr 67,000), rabbit muscle aldolase
(mr 158,000), bovine liver catalase (mr 232,000), horse spleen ferritin
(mr 440,000), bovine thyroid thyroglobulin (mr 669,000), e. coli aspartate aminotransferase (mr 43,573 ⫻ 2), and e. coli branched-chain
amino acid aminotransferase (mr 33,962 ⫻ 6) were used as standard
proteins.
spectrophotometric measurement—the absorption spectra of spt
were recorded with a hitachi spectrophotometer u-3300 at 25 °c. the
buffer solution for the absorption measurements contained 50 mm
hepes-naoh (ph 7.5) and 0.1 mm edta. spt was equilibrated with
the above buffer by gel filtration using a pd-10 (sephadex g-25) column
(amersham pharmacia biotech) prior to the measurement.

water-soluble homodimeric serine palmitoyltransferase

other methods—protein concentration during the purification procedure was determined with a bca protein assay kit (pierce chemical)
using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard. the protein concentration of
purified spt was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar
extinction coefficient of 2.83 ⫻ 104 m⫺1 cm⫺1 at 280 nm for the plp form
of the enzyme. sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page)
was carried out with an sds-tris system using 10% polyacrylamide gel
according to the procedure described by laemmli (22).

spt activity in s. paucimobilis and s. spiritivorum—
s. paucimobilis and s. spiritivorum contain a large amount of
sphingolipids as their cell components (16, 17), and thus sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes have been expected to exist in
these bacteria. cell-free extracts (100,000 ⫻ g supernatants)
prepared by sonication of cells of these strains were examined
for spt activity by incubation with [14c]serine and unlabeled
 xxxd2832xxx -coa. the lipids were extracted and subjected to tlc
analysis. some radioactive products were detected for each
extract (fig. 1). one of these products was indistinguishable in
migration from kds formed by mouse liver microsomes. the
cell fractionation experiment indicates that the spts of these
bacteria are water-soluble enzymes (fig. 1). because the extracts of s. paucimobilis showed higher spt activity than that
of s. spiritivorum, s. paucimobilis was selected as the starting
material for the purification of spt.
purification of spt from s. paucimobilis—the enzyme was
purified to homogeneity by five steps of column chromatography. as shown in fig. 2, the purified spt showed a single
protein band with an apparent mr of about 50,000 on sdspage. cell-free extracts of s. paucimobilis contain a large
amount of yellow pigment, which was very difficult to remove
by the initial two hydrophobic column chromatographies. table
i summarizes the purification of spt from the s. paucimobilis
extract. about 350 ␮g of the protein could be obtained from 6
liters of s. paucimobilis culture. the purification yield was
reproducibly over 100% probably because some coexisting inhibitory materials were removed as the purification proceeded.
the purified enzyme could be stored at 4 °c in sterile capped
vials for up to 2 months in 20 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5)
without loss of activity.
physical characterizations—the mr of the purified enzyme
was estimated to be about 90,000 by gel filtration. electrospray

ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) gave a signal at m/z
44,916. these results show that the native spt from s. paucimobilis has a dimer structure composed of two identical subunits. the purified spt had an absorption spectrum with two
peaks at 338 and 426 nm other than the protein absorption
peak at 278 nm in 50 mm hepes-naoh (ph 7.5) containing
0.1 mm edta (fig. 3). these absorption peaks are characteristic of plp enzymes, which contain the cofactor bound to the
⑀-amino group of a lysine residue in the active site (23). the
addition of serine to the enzyme gave rise to an intense absorption band at 426 nm and a less intense band at 338 nm, which
indicates that 338 nm absorption represents the active species
and that the external aldimine complex was formed.
catalytic properties and substrate specificity—the time
course of kds formation by the purified spt was almost linear
for at least 20 min, and this activity was proportional to the
amount of purified enzyme up to 100 ng under the reaction
conditions mentioned above. the optimum ph for kds formation was 7.5⫺8.0. spt from s. paucimobilis was not inhibited
by halide ions. no inhibition of spt activity was found with
relatively high concentrations of  xxxd2832xxx -coa (up to 10 mm).
the substrate specificity is summarized in tables ii and iii.
to assess the specificity for amino acids, we determined the
production of [14c]kds derivatives from [14c] xxxd2832xxx -coa
with 20 natural amino acids or various serine analogs. purified
spt (50 ng) was incubated with 0.8 mm [14c] xxxd2832xxx -coa and
4 mm various amino as the substrate. the activity was detected
only for serine among the natural amino acids examined (data
not shown). serine methylester and o- xxxd1857xxx  were converted to kds at lower rates (5 and 3% of the mean levels of
kds formed with serine, respectively). however, at present, we
cannot preclude the possibility that serine derived from serine

methylester by hydrolysis was metabolized to kds. we also
examined the inhibition effect of excess amounts of nonradioactive competitors on the [3h]kds production from 0.1 mm

l-[ h]serine (table ii). [ h]kds production was inhibited
about 80% by 4 mm nonradioactive l-serine under this assay
condition. the inhibition of the [3h]kds production by 4 mm
each of other natural amino acids except for cysteine was 40%
or less. the effect of cysteine can be ascribed to the thiazolidine
formation of cysteine with plp (23). o- xxxd1857xxx  was the
most effective, with ␣-methyl-dl-serine, 3-hydroxypropionate,
and serine methyester following in this order. seriamide and
serinol were essentially inert. among various acyl-coas examined,  xxxd2832xxx -coa was the best substrate (table iii). the
unsaturated bond of the acyl chain of coa analogs did not
significantly influence the spt activity. the activity chain
length profile showed a bell-shaped pattern, which peaked
around c16.
kinetic parameters of native spt—steady-state analysis of
the purified spt was carried out. the kinetic parameters for
spt were determined with respect to serine and palmitoylcoa. as shown in fig. 4, the experimental data were analyzed
according to the ordered bi-bi mechanism (24). the km values

the national center for biotechnology information were
scanned for amino acid sequences similar to the s. paucimobilis spt sequence using the blast algorithm (25). the predicted s. paucimobilis spt protein is related to proteins
grouped as the ␣- xxxd160xxx  synthase family. this gene family
includes eukaryotic spt subunits, 5- xxxd148xxx  synthase in heme biosynthesis, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase
(aons) in biotin biosynthesis, and 2-amino-3-ketobutyratecoa ligase in the threonine utilization pathway, all of which
catalyze chemically similar reactions using the cofactor plp
(26 –30). the amino acid sequence alignment of s. paucimobilis
spt and mouse  xxxg2194xxx  and  xxxg2195xxx  proteins is shown in fig. 6.

except for the nh2-terminal transmembrane region of mouse
lcb proteins. spt has 27% identity and 48% similarity with
mouse  xxxg2194xxx  and 31% identity and 49% similarity with mouse
 xxxg2195xxx . fig. 7 shows the amino acid sequence alignment of
s. paucimobilis spt and three prokaryotic enzymes in the
␣- xxxd160xxx  synthase family. there are 33% amino acid identity
and 56% similarity between spt and aons of bacillus sphaerious, 33% identity and 54% similarity between spt and 2amino- xxxd64xxx -coa ligase of bacillus subtilis, and 36%
identity and 55% similarity between spt and 5- xxxd148xxx 
acid synthase of agrobacterium radiobacter.
expression of the spt gene in e. coli—in order to construct
the expression system for s. paucimobilis spt in e. coli, the
internal ndei restriction site (334atgcat) of  xxxg2194xxx  was
changed to atgcac without changing the codons by sitedirected mutagenesis, and the new restriction sites, ndei and
hindiii, were introduced to  xxxg2194xxx  at the translation initiation
and termination sites, respectively, by pcr. the modified
 xxxg2194xxx  was ligated into a pet21b vector, and the recombinant
plasmid was used to transform e. coli bl21(de3) plyss cells.
the spt produced was functional, and the product amounted
to about 10⫺20% of the total protein in the crude extract of
e. coli. because of the overproduction of the protein, the expressed spt would be partially in the apo form, but it could be
converted to the holoenzyme by addition of plp to the cell
lysate. the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity
using deae-toyopearl, butyl-toyopearl, and hydroxyapatite
column chromatographies. the recombinant spt provided a
50-kda band on sds-page (data not shown). the nh2-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme, thr-glu-ala-ala-ala-,
agreed with that of the native enzyme. thus, the first methionine of the recombinant spt was similarly removed by processing. the purified spt showed a peak with m/z ⫽ 44,899 on
esi-ms, which is in agreement with the native spt within
experimental error. the catalytic properties of the recombinant

spt was the same as that of the native spt; there is no
significant difference between the two enzymes in their steadystate kinetic parameters (table iv).
discussion

because large scale cultivation of strict anaerobic bacteria is
difficult and the unsuccessful purification of the b. melaninogenicus spt has already been reported (15), we searched for
aerobic bacteria containing sphingolipids and chose s. paucimobilis as an alternative purification source. s. paucimobilis
contains sphingolipids which form more than 30% of the total
extractable lipid (16, 19). there is a report that 14c-labeled
 xxxd2154xxx  or amino acids were incorporated into the sphingolipids of s. paucimobilis (31). these findings suggest the possibility for this bacterium to contain spt.
the most important finding is that the s. paucimobilis spt
is water-soluble and is a dimer composed of two identical subunits. all the eukaryotic enzymes examined so far are heterodimers, and both of the subunits are membrane-bound proteins. membrane localization of eukaryotic spt complexes
seems reasonable because the product of this enzyme is a
hydrophobic lipid incorporated into membranes. the relationship between cellular localization and the mechanism of the
product release of bacterial spt is the next subject of research.
how is the reaction product, kds, transferred to the membrane? does spt interact with membrane in vivo? do other
sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes also exist as water-soluble
forms in s. paucimobilis? as for the subunit composition, we
can reasonably consider that bacterial spts are homodimers.
judging from the high sequence homology between  xxxg2194xxx  and
 xxxg2195xxx , ancestral spt would have been a homodimer, and the
gene was duplicated at some point early in the evolution of
eukaryotes. the functional benefit for the heterodimerization,
or the role of the  xxxg2194xxx  subunit, however, remains unknown.

japan). residues conserved among all proteins are fulltone-inverted and those conserved between the two of these members are halftone-inverted.

acteristic of the plp enzyme. the ratio in the peak height of
the plp-derived absorption bands (338 and 426 nm) to the
protein-derived band (278 nm) indicates that spt binds two
plp molecules per dimer. s. paucimobilis spt is not inhibited
by halide ions, although spt activity of b. melaninogenicus has
been reported to be significantly inhibited (15). the inhibition
by high concentrations of  xxxd2832xxx -coa, which has been observed for the eukaryotic enzymes, was not detected in s.
paucimobilis spt (fig. 4) as well as in the b. melaninogenicus
enzyme (11, 15, 32).
the substrate recognition of s. paucimobilis spt was not so
strict, especially for the acyl-coa substrate, compared with the
eukaryotic enzymes (11, 32). this observation might reflect the
difference in the biological functions of sphingolipids between
prokaryote and eukaryote. in eukaryotes, because sphingolipid
metabolites take part in the intra- and intercellular signal
transduction pathways, it would be necessary to regulate
strictly their chemical structures and amounts by the synthetic
enzymes. on the other hand, such physiological functions are
not known for bacterial sphingolipids.
as shown in table ii, o- xxxd1857xxx  inhibited the
[3h]kds formation from l-[3h]serine as potently as the lserine. this is consistent with the finding that o- xxxd1857xxx  was converted to a kds derivative. both serinamide and
serinol, derivatives in which the carboxyl group of serine is
modified, are not potent competitors of [3h]serine in the above
reaction. the inhibitory effects of 3-hydroxypropionate and
␣-methyl-dl-serine agreed with the belief that they can form
complexes with spt, which mimic the michaelis complex and
the external aldimine, respectively. these results indicate that
the carboxyl group of serine is essential for the recognition of
the amino acid substrates by spt.
sequence comparison between the s. paucimobilis spt and
other prokaryotic enzymes of the ␣- xxxd160xxx  synthase family

shows that conserved amino acids are distributed throughout
the entire sequence (fig. 7). in addition to lys-267 that forms
a schiff base linkage with plp, catalytically important residues identified by x-ray crystallography on aons from e. coli
are completely conserved at the corresponding positions in
spt, such as his-159, asp-231, and his-234 (figs. 6 and 7,
asterisk and triangles) (33). these residues interact directly
with plp, and his-159 and asp-231 are also conserved in other
plp-dependent enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferases
from various organisms.
we have succeeded in construction of the overproduction
system of spt in e. coli. the growth rate of e. coli was not
inhibited even after the expression was induced, and the spt
overproduced was catalytically active. until now, it has been
thought that the toxicity of kds, the reaction product of spt,
is one of the reasons why the expression system of spt in e.
coli cannot be constructed. however, the present results imply
that kds is not toxic to the e. coli host, or it is rapidly metabolized. the recombinant spt was catalytically and spectrophotometrically indistinguishable from the native protein. there
has been little success in the overproduction of the enzymes in
the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, and almost no detailed
research exists concerning the enzymatic characterization of
these enzymes. this work permitted enough spt for the threedimensional structural analysis of this protein, which is essential for elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this enzyme.
we are now attempting crystallization and x-ray diffraction
studies of the s. paucimobilis spt. information obtained from
the sphingomonas enzyme would provide us with insight into
the more complex eukaryotic homologue.
