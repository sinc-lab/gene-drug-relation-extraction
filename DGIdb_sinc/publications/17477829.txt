 xxxg778xxx : real-time kinetics and
inhibition by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
in a scintillation assay
j. fraser glickman and andres schmid

abstract: a mix-and-read flashplate® (perkinelmer, waltham, ma) assay for the enzyme farnesyl
pyrophosphate (fpp) synthase ( xxxg778xxx ) was developed to rapidly measure both steps in the synthesis
of fpp from  xxxd1897xxx  ( xxxd1897xxx ). the assay used either  xxxd1897xxx  or geranyl
pyrophosphate (gpp) and [3h] xxxd2397xxx  ([3h]ipp) as substrates, and measured the
 xxxg778xxx -catalyzed conversion of these into [3h]fpp or [3h]gpp by capturing the products onto a
phospholipid-coated scintillating microtiter plate and monitoring the product formation in a chargecoupled device imager. the michaelis-menten parameters—kcat gpp (38/min), km ipp (0.6 m), and
km gpp (0.7 m)—were consistent with previous studies using difficult phase separation techniques.
the 50% inhibitory concentrations of various nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (n-bps) were
determined and were also consistent with prior literature. without precedent, weaker inhibition (5
m) of the non-n-bps was also detected. in preincubation studies, the potency of the n-bps, and
specifically  xxxd3561xxx , increased slowly over time by 100-fold. this potency shift was reversed
significantly by the inclusion of gpp with  xxxd3561xxx .  xxxd3561xxx  was uncompetitive with respect
to ipp. thus, these studies were consistent with prior structural and thermodynamic studies, and
suggest a rapid formation of a lower-affinity complex between  xxxd3561xxx  and the gpp binding site,
followed by the formation of a very tight complex of  xxxd3561xxx  and enzyme, which excludes
further binding of gpp. furthermore, one of the substrates from the first step in the catalytic cycle,
 xxxd1897xxx , was identified as a 1 m inhibitor of the second step of the catalysis, suggesting that the
fpp two-step synthesis is regulated by  xxxd1897xxx .

introduction
arnesyl pyrophosphate (fpp) synthase ( xxxg778xxx ) is a
key branchpoint enzyme in the mevalonate pathway,
which produces cholesterol and other polyisoprenes critical for membrane component synthesis and gtpasebased signal transduction.1,2 the enzyme is a 78–80-kda
homodimer that catalyzes the formation of fpp and  xxxd2194xxx  (gpp) from  xxxd2397xxx  (ipp) and  xxxd1897xxx  ( xxxd1897xxx )
(see fig. 1).

f

synthesis of fpp is catalyzed through two consecutive 1-4 (head-to-tail) condensation reactions between
first the allylic pyrophosphate,  xxxd1897xxx  and ipp, to
form gpp, and then a second condensation between
gpp (an allylic pyrophosphate) and ipp-3 (see fig. 1).
based on product inhibition studies using gpp and pyrophosphate (ppi), the kinetic mechanism has been
shown to be “ordered bi-bi,” where a ternary complex
is formed in two steps, first by binding of an allylic
substrate ( xxxd1897xxx  or gpp) and then by binding of ipp
to the enzyme, which rapidly converts through a car-

bocation intermediate into ppi and either gpp or fpp,
the two possible products.3,4
variations of a phase separation assay requiring high
performance liquid chromatography separation of labeled
products have been used to determine the steady-state
constants of both substrates, generally in the 0.5 m
range, with a kcat approximately between 20 and 170
turnovers/min.2,5 using equilibrium dialysis, the kd for
 xxxd1897xxx  was 1.8 m, for gpp was 0.17 m, and for fpp
was 0.73 m, where  xxxd1897xxx  and gpp are competitive
with each other. studies using both binding assays and
catalytic assays have supported the proposal that each
monomer of the enzyme has two sites: an allylic site 1,
which can bind  xxxd1897xxx , fpp, or gpp, and an ipp binding site 2—although ipp can bind to site 1 in the absence
of allylic substrates.
 xxxg778xxx  has been found to be a target for nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (n-bp) drugs,6,7 which are currently used for preventing bone loss resulting from osteoporosis, metastatic bone disease, and paget disease.8–11
bisphosphonates are an unusual drug class in that when
they are administered, they rapidly localize to bone and
inhibit the action of osteoclasts and macrophages.1,12
structural investigations comparing the free  xxxg778xxx  enzyme to that in complex with the n-bp  xxxd3561xxx  and
ipp have suggested that, first, the inhibitor binds to an
open formation of the  xxxd1897xxx /gpp site, which causes a
partial closure, and, second, ipp binds to the enzyme–inhibitor complex and induces a full closure, thus preventing further catalysis.5,13 isothermal titration calorimetry
(itc) has determined that the affinity of some of the nbps for  xxxg778xxx  ranges between 15 and 164 nm, additionally suggesting slow, tight binding inhibition to the enzyme.5
of critical importance in using  xxxg778xxx  as a target for
drug discovery is having a robust and well-characterized
set of in vitro assays. prior  xxxg778xxx  assay methods have
used organic:aqueous extraction, followed by chromatographic separation in order to quantify the formation of
radiolabeled substrates and products.3,5–7,14,15 these
methods are extremely time-consuming. based on knowledge of the enzyme’s activity, we have designed a rapid,
miniaturized assay using scintillation proximity, similar
to a previously reported  xxxg765xxx  assay using
a flashplate® (perkinelmer, waltham, ma).16,17 the radiolabeled product of the  xxxg778xxx  reaction can be captured
on a phospholipid-coated flashplate, which emits photons when tritium is in close proximity. the tritiated fpp
that is formed binds to the plate, while the [3h]ipp does
not. the flashplate method has the advantage of eliminating the requirement for laborious separation of the
products from the substrates, and the reaction progress
can be measured in real time, allowing for precise kinetic
investigations. our studies with flashplates confirm previous evidence for slow, tight binding of n-bps to the

glickman and schmid

allylic site, and further suggest that  xxxd1897xxx  is a preferred substrate over gpp in a nonprocessive two-step
synthesis of fpp.

materials and methods
materials
recombinant human  xxxg778xxx  was cloned, expressed, and
purified as previously described13 and stored as a 10
mg/ml stock solution in 25 mm tris (ph 7.4), 25 mm
nacl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. [3h]gpp (20 ci/mmol)
was stored as a 1 mg/ml solution in 4 parts isopropanol:3
parts ammonia:1 part water. 1-[3h]ipp (40 ci/mmol, 1
ci/ml; anawa trading ag, zurich, switzerland) was
stored in ethanol:ammonia hydroxide (1:1 vol/vol) at
80°c. 1-[3h]fpp triammonium salt (60 ci/mmol, 1
mci/ml; anawa trading ag) was stored in 70% ethanol
and 0.25 m ammonium bicarbonate. unlabeled fpp,
gpp, and ipp were purchased from anawa trading ag.
 xxxd1897xxx  was purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo).
phospholipid-coated 384-well imaging flashplates were
purchased from perkinelmer. all bisphosphonate compounds were from the novartis pharma ag (basel,
switzerland) compound archive.
 xxxg778xxx  enzyme assay
two separate catalytic processes were measured as
shown in fig. 1. the  xxxg778xxx  assay reaction was performed
in a final volume of 12 l at 22°c in the flashplate, with
four equivalent 3-l additions, each containing a compound or blank, two of the substrates, and the enzyme.
prior to the addition into the assay reaction mix, ipp,
fpp, gpp,  xxxd1897xxx , and  xxxg778xxx  were diluted to a 4 final concentration in an assay buffer that consisted of 20
mm hepes (ph 7.4), 5 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm cacl2.
all inhibitors were diluted in the same assay buffer containing 18.5%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) prior to addition to the assay reaction mix. thus, the only variables
in the assay set-up were in the order of addition of the
components to the flashplate, the final concentrations of
the components, and the incubation time. these specific
variables are indicated in the figure legends. for steadystate reactions, the compound or blank was added first (3
l) and then each of two substrates (2  3 l), and the
reaction was started with the addition of 3 l of  xxxg778xxx 
followed by mixing. where preincubation of  xxxg778xxx  with
compounds was examined, 6 l of the compound/ xxxg778xxx 
mixture in assay buffer with 9% dmso was added to 6
l of the substrates in assay buffer and mixed into the
flashplate. the final concentrations and specific activities of the substrates and enzyme are indicated in the figure legends. after addition of all components, the mixture was incubated in the flashplates for various times

the assay concept is based upon differences in hydrophobicity among fpp, ipp,  xxxd1897xxx , and gpp. for
example, fpp is very hydrophobic, while the substrate
ipp is more hydrophilic and can be labeled with tritium.
the product formation can be detected by using a
phospholipid-coated flashplate, which contains surfaceembedded scintillation materials and has preferential
binding to hydrophobic substances.16 the use of a supercooled ccd-based imaging instrument to monitor the
assay has the advantages of rapid reading time and reduced compound interference from yellow compounds
over prior methods using a photomultiplier tube-based
system.18 because of the fast imager reading time, the
enzyme kinetics can be monitored in real time, without

the need for the addition of a reaction-stopping step, or
of a reaction quencher, thus making the assay well suited
for studies of enzyme inhibition.
the first set of experiments established that the flashplates were able to partition product away from the substrate and yield a product-specific signal. furthermore,
these experiments served as a system for calibrating the
amount of product formed by the enzyme based on the
signal from the ccd instrument. figure 2a demonstrates
that fpp can be discriminated from ipp and gpp by selective binding to the plate and, furthermore, that the pixel
density raw data can be translated into moles of product
formed based on a linear fit. a dynamic range was observed over at least three orders of magnitude. the relationship between the pixel density and amount of
[3h]fpp present fit the linear equation [fpp]  [(pixel
density  21)  0.48], and in subsequent studies this
type of conversion was used to determine the quantity of
fpp formed. as indicated in fig. 2b, the rate of surface
capture of the product, fpp, was rapid, reaching saturation by 30 min. in order to eliminate the possibility of
table 1.

kinetic artifacts, all subsequent enzyme kinetic determinations were performed using time points after the 30min reaction progress and with less than 25% substrate
conversion, such that the maximal product formed would
be 170 nm. additional experiments using gpp gave the
same results (data not shown). the read time for 384 assay points in parallel was 2 min, thus making the readout a suitable measure of product formation in real time.
the next set of experiments was used to assess the activity of the  xxxg778xxx . for measuring the second step of catalysis we incubated  xxxg778xxx  with [3h]ipp and gpp in a flashplate and counted the radioactivity in the reaction at
various time points (fig. 3). this and several other experiments with varied concentrations of ipp and gpp
ranging between 64 nm and 1,500 nm demonstrated that
the reaction progress was linear after 15 min, thus making it possible to measure the initial velocity at varying
concentrations of substrate under steady-state conditions
and determine km and vmax and make a good estimate of
kcat (figs. 4 and 5). the variation of kcat seemed to correlate with the use of different enzyme batches in different experiments, suggesting that some preparations had
a higher percentage of active enzymes than others. overall, our steady-state results are consistent with prior published reports of  xxxg778xxx  from various vertebrate species
shown in table 1. it should be noted that because the assay was done in a 384-well microtiter plate and the ccd
reader does not have temperature control, our studies
were carried out at 22°c (with thermostatically controlled
room heating and cooling units), whereas published studies were performed at 37°c.
our next experiments were used to measure the catalytic conversion of  xxxd1897xxx  and ipp into gpp and, consequently, fpp. in these experiments, shown in fig. 6a,
the  xxxg778xxx  enzyme was incubated with [3h]ipp and
 xxxd1897xxx . in this configuration, the  xxxg778xxx  would be predicted to form gpp and then subsequently convert this
into fpp. these experiments are more difficult to interpret kinetically, because the flashplate signal is  xxxd2870xxx -

up a steady-state gpp-to-fpp catalyzed reaction as described previously and included increasing concentrations
of  xxxd1897xxx , thus demonstrating in fig. 6b that  xxxd1897xxx 
has an ic50 of 1 m. to our knowledge this is the first
observation that the first substrate blocks the formation of
fpp in the second step of the reaction. assuming the gpp
and  xxxd1897xxx  binding sites are the same,13 our results suggest that the two-step reaction is not processive. in this
case, processivity assumes that as soon as gpp is formed
from  xxxd1897xxx  and ipp it does not leave the binding site,
but undergoes a movement within the catalytic pocket,
such that fpp is formed. contrary to this assumption, our
results suggest that the gpp formed in step 1 (fig. 1) of
the reaction can leave the enzyme catalytic site and can be
replaced by  xxxd1897xxx  prior to the second step of the reaction. build-up of  xxxd1897xxx  in the cell to 1 m concentrations would force the reaction towards the first step in
catalysis—the synthesis of gpp—and only after the
 xxxd1897xxx  concentration is reduced does the reaction proceed towards fpp synthesis.

dent upon two indistinguishable consecutive catalytic
steps, so it was not possible to determine the kcat for this
reaction. however, we observed under steady-state conditions a concentration dependence of  xxxd1897xxx , suggesting
a km of approximately 0.15 m. interestingly, the curve
was biphasic, and at about 500 nm  xxxd1897xxx  the catalytic
rate was diminished (fig. 6a). from this observation, we
hypothesized that  xxxd1897xxx  served as a blocker of the second step in the reaction, involving the conversion of gpp
into fpp. an alternative explanation would be that higher
concentrations of  xxxd1897xxx  interfered with the binding of
fpp to the flashplate. in order to rule out this possibility,
we examined the effect of up to 100 m  xxxd1897xxx  on binding of both [3h]fpp and [3h]gpp to the flashplate.
 xxxd1897xxx  showed no effect on the detection or binding of
products on the flashplate (data not shown). we then set

tors. figure 7 and table 2 show the results of inhibition
curves performed on several n-bps and non-n-bps ordered by potency. generally, our method seemed to be
more sensitive to bisphosphonate inhibition than the older
methods; however, our experiments are in close agreement
with those recently reported.5 prior studies have not demonstrated any inhibition by the non-n-bps,  xxxd1721xxx  and
 xxxd2063xxx , whereas the flashplate assay detected weak,
but dose-dependent and reproducible, inhibition.
we were also able to examine the effect of the compounds on the net two-step reaction and on the second
step of the reaction. the weaker compounds tended to be
equipotent in both reactions, whereas some compounds,
notably  xxxd3561xxx  and  xxxd3128xxx , were more potent in
the two-step reaction. since the two-step reaction is complex with respect to the number of possible substrates and
products, it is very difficult to make any mechanistic interpretation of these results.
as shown in table 2 and in fig. 8, preincubation of
the enzyme with the n-bp inhibitors for 30 min results
in a dramatic increase in the potency (and, presumably,
the affinity) of the compound for the  xxxg778xxx . a prior study
has demonstrated this phenomenon, and along with itc
experiments has made a case for a low, tight-binding inhibition mechanism.7 generally, a “slow, tight-binding”
inhibitor works by forming an initial low-affinity com-

preincubated with  xxxg778xxx  for various times at various concentrations prior to the start of the step 2 steady-state reaction, with

plex followed by an “isomerization” or conformational
change in the enzyme in order to form a more high-affinity complex. this conformational change is slower than
the diffusion-controlled “on-rate” would be. using the
flashplate assay, we looked more closely at the kinetics
of potency shift, by varying the preincubation time prior
to adding substrates and then recording the steady-state
velocity over 45 min, shown in fig. 9. we observed a
rapid increase in the potency by 10-fold in the first
minute, followed by a slow increase in potency over 1 h,
leading to an ic50 that is near the enzyme concentration
of 1 nm. furthermore, as shown in fig. 10, the potency
shift in ic50 can be partially reversed by preincubation
of gpp along with  xxxd3561xxx . additionally,  xxxd1897xxx 
was also able to reverse the potency shift by preincubation in the  xxxd1897xxx  reaction (data not shown), supporting the interchangeability of the allylic site for gpp or
 xxxd1897xxx . overall, these data suggest that after an initial
rapid binding of  xxxd3561xxx  to the apo-enzyme, a slow
conformational change occurs (isomerization), which
locks the enzyme– xxxd3561xxx  into a tightly bound single digit nanomolar complex. the inhibition of  xxxd3561xxx  appears to be bimodal.
from prior studies we know that  xxxg778xxx  catalysis is a
two-step, three-substrate process with an ordered bi-bi
mechanism.  xxxd3561xxx  appears to be a tight binding inhibitor.3,4 these two factors make the mechanistic studies difficult to model and interpret. however, we were
able to perform a  xxxd3561xxx  inhibition study under varying concentrations of gpp and saturating ipp, shown in
fig. 11. we fit the data to the four standard models of
inhibition, and our data clearly supported an uncompetitive mechanism with respect to ipp.
the classical interpretation of uncompetitive inhibition
with a single-substrate enzyme is that the inhibitor binds
to the enzyme–substrate complex, yielding an inactive enzyme–substrate–inhibitor complex, and that the inhibitor

213

 xxxg778xxx 

does not bind to the free enzyme.21 however, we know
that  xxxd3561xxx  binds to the free enzyme, and has an ordered bi-bi mechanism.3,4 thus we propose that the uncompetitive behavior is a consequence of an inhibition
mechanism, quite common in ordered bi-reactant enzyme
systems,21 whereby  xxxd3561xxx  reacts with one or more
enzyme forms independent of ipp binding to yield a complex that can no longer participate in the catalytic process.
in this case,13  xxxd3561xxx  rapidly binds to the gpp binding site, followed by a slow formation of a tightly bound
complex. unfortunately, a limitation in the technology did
not allow us to perform the converse experiment, having
saturating ipp and varying gpp, since the signal to background at very high concentrations of ipp is very low.
these investigations of  xxxg778xxx , using a novel and independent “mix-and-read” assay system, are remarkably
consistent with recent reports that used crystal structures,
itc, and phase-separation enzyme inhibition studies to
suggest a slow-binding mechanism of n-bps, with the
binding of n-bps to the allylic substrate site, and not the
ipp site.5,13 it is difficult to know the pharmacological
implications of these kinetic findings. part of this difficulty lies in knowing which form of the enzyme exists
in a cellular environment, and what the intracellular concentrations of substrates and products that control the kinetics would be. in the preincubation studies, we have
observed that dilute solutions of the enzyme are not particularly stable; however, the enzymes are stabilized by
substrate. also, most prior studies focus on the second
step in catalysis, while in a cellular environment, both
steps would occur. presumably, gpp, fpp,  xxxd1897xxx , ppi,
and ipp are present in the cell, and all of these would to
some degree bind to the enzyme.

fig. 10. ipp and gpp affect the preincubation  xxxd3561xxx

45 min, and  xxxg778xxx   1 nm (12 fmol per reaction) (n  4), 1
nm  xxxg778xxx  was preincubated for 30 min with various concentrations of  xxxd3561xxx  in the absence or presence of 150 nm
gpp or 150 nm ipp prior to starting the reaction with one of
the lacking substrates: ic50 without preincubation ()  405 
150 nm; ic50 with 30-min preincubation ( )  7  2 nm; ic50
co-incubated with 150 nm ipp ()  11  5 nm; and ic50 coincubated with 150 nm gpp ()  55  36 nm.

1 nm, at t  45 min (n  4), giving an apparent ki  336 
89 nm with r2  0.98.  xxxg778xxx  was added to substrates and  xxxd3561xxx  to start the catalytic reaction in a 12-l assay volume.
the  xxxd3561xxx  concentration was as follows: 0 nm ( ); 300
nm (); 500 nm (); 600 nm (); 900 nm ( ); and 1,200 nm
().

clearly, there are many more experiments suggested
by this study. our efforts at building kinetic models of
inhibition suggest that  xxxd3561xxx  is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor, as suggested by the preincubation studies
(fig. 9) and by a nonlinear effect on the progress curve
similar to that observed with inhibition of thrombin by
serpins22 under steady-state conditions (data not shown).
however, the overall  xxxg778xxx -catalyzed reaction contains
at least 15 equilibria and 30 different rate constants, making predictions difficult. further modeling of the kinetic
mechanisms involved in inhibition by  xxxd1897xxx  and nbps to suggest further experimental designs will be a focus of future investigations.
although scintillation proximity assays (including
flashplate assays) using ccd imagers were originally
developed for hts purposes,16–18,23 they have a more
general utility because of the mix-and-read, real-time
readout. this particular manifestation of the assay, which
utilizes a flashplate with high affinity for lipids, has potential usefulness in measuring any enzyme involved in
a hydrophilic to hydrophobic transformation and may
also represent a more physiological assay, since it is performed in the presence of phospholipids. we have here
presented an extended use of the technology for enzyme
kinetic studies, and such assays might also be useful in
other applications such as biomarker development where
a rapid, precise, reproducible method for measuring  xxxg778xxx 
activity in tissue samples is required.
