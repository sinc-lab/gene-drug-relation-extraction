 xxxd1893xxx  (1), 10-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-9,9-dimethyl-acridan,
is a tricyclic
compound with a central hexagonal ring instead of the heptagonal ring common to most
antidepressants. clinical properties and the value of this drug in the treatment of depressive
states, and in a variety of psychic disorders have been well established (2,3). a previous
paper (4) demonstrated the metabolic fate of  xxxd1893xxx  by means of a radiometric assay.<br>
recent works (5-8) for the subcellularfractionation of brain tissuepermitted the isolation
of pinched-offnerve endings or synaptosomesand it has been observed that the bound form
of putative central transmitters (9, 10) and the enzymes (11) related to those transmitters,
i.e., acetylcholine, serotonin, noradrenaline, cholineacetylase, cholinesterase, 5-hydroxy
tryptophan decarboxylaseand catechol-o-methyltransferaseare highly concentrated in the
synaptosomal fraction. compartmentation of certain of these components within synapto
somes has been studied by disrupting the synaptosomes in water or in freezing and thawing
procedures, and subsequently separating fractions containing soluble cytoplasmic con
stituents, synaptic vesicles, synaptic membranes, junctional complexes and intraterminal
mitochondria by means of a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation (12-14). these
findings suggest that for studying the mode of action of drugs and toxins on the central
nervous system, distributions in subcellular organelles of synaptic region must be demon
strated in detail.<br>
the present paper deals with subcellular distribution of h<sup>3</sup>- xxxd1893xxx 
in rat cerebral
cortex using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation and further studies by
means of an electron microscope.

product was chemicallyand radiochemicallypure determined by mixed melting points with
authentic  xxxd1893xxx  and by thin layer chromatography (silica gel f.,,,, 0.25 mm thick,
merck ag., germany) in the following solvent systems; chloroform-methanol (8 : 5) and
chloroform-dioxanc-aceticacid (10 : 10 : 3).
2. animals
male wistar rats (200-250 g) were given 350,ng/30ttl (7.7 1 ci) of h3-dimetacrineby the
direct lateral intraventricular injection method of noble et al. (16). in a oral administration,
rats were given 20 mg/kg (0.44mci/kg) of h3- xxxd1893xxx . all animals used here were
fasted overnight before experiments.
3. preparation of tissuefractions
subcellular fractions
rats were sacrificedby decapitation at appropriate time intervals after drug administra
tion and the cerebral cortex was rapidly removed. this and subsequent procedures were
carried out at 4 c. the pooled cerebral cortex was homogenized in a 0.32 m sucrose
(10%) in a teflon-glasshomogenizer and the homogenate was separated into crude nuclear
(p1),crude mitochondrial (p2), microsomal (p3+p4) and supernatant fractions as described
by gray and whittaker (6).
submitochondrialfractions
further fractionation of fraction pz was accomplished on a discontinuous density
gradient consistingof equal layers of 1.2 and 0.8 m sucrose. the p2pellet was resuspended
in 0.32 m sucrose, layered on the gradient and centrifuged at 53,500 g for 2 hr in a
hitachi 65 p ultracentrifuge with the rps 25-3a swing rotor. this procedure resulted in
3 fractions, i.e., fraction a (f-a; particle density, 0.32-0.8 m sucrose),fraction b (f-b; par
ticle density,0.8-1.2 m sucrose) and pellet c (f-c; particle density, below 1.2 m sucrose).
disruptionof f-b and suhfractionatlonof resultingfraction
the fraction b was diluted with equal volumes of water and centrifuged at 100,000x g
for 1 hr. the resultant f-b pellet was disrupted by suspended in water (2 ml/g of original
tissue) followed by freezing and thawing once. suspension of disrupted materials was ap
plied to the discontinuous density gradient consisting of five successivelayers of 1.2, 1.0,
0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 m sucrose and centrifuged at 53,500, g for 2 hr in hitachi 65 p ultracent
rifuge with the rps 25-3a swing rotor. this procedure resulted in 6 fractions as shown in
fig. 1.
fractions were isolated by means of a tube slicer.
4. electron microscopy
fractions obtained from a discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation were
fixed by the addition of an equal volumesof 8 / phosphate-bufferedglutaraldehydein 0.32 m
sucrose (0.1 m, ph 7.5) for 2 hr in ice-cold water. after centrifugation of the mixture
(100,000 g, i hr), the resultant pellet was washed twice with phosphate-scurose (0.32m)
buffer (0.1 m, ph 7.5) and postfixed in 1.5;,; buffered osmium tetroxide of caulfield (17)
for 1.5 hr in ice-coldwater. dehydration was carried out in graded concentrations of ethanol
and the pellets were embedded in epoxy resin of luft (18). in some cases, f-c and f-6

were resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose and then fixed, dehydrated and embedded, as described
above. ultra thin sections (silver to grey interference colour) were picked up on collodion
coated copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead acetate of millonig (19), and ex
amined by a jem-t7 electron microscope.
5. analytical methods
protein determination
protein was determined by the method of lowry et al. (20), using crystalline bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
chromatographic separation of the radioactive component
the radioactivecomponent of rat cerebral cortex was extracted by the method of schatz
et al. (21) and then subjected to thin layer chromatography with the solvent systems of
chloroform-methanol (8 : 5) and chloroform-dioxane-aceticacid (10 : 10 :3). distribution
of radioactivity on chromatograms was scanned by means of a aloka asf-7 chromatoscan
ner. internal standard of  xxxd1893xxx  on chromatograms was located by the absorption
of uv light (254 m,tr,).
counting
an
aliquot of each of the fractions (0.2or 0.5 nil) was added to counting vialscontaining
10ml of tt-21 emulsion phosphor (22) and h'-radioactivity was counted in a aloka lsc-502
liquid scintillationspectrometer. the counts per min (cpm) were converted to disintegrations
per min (dpm) by the use of the internal standard method. counting efficiencyof h'-radio
activity was approx. 30%.
