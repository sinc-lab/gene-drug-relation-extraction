abstract

since 1990 it has repeatedly been reported that some histamine  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonists (e.g. terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ) are able to produce ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes) when they are given at dosages above the
therapeutic range and/or administered together with cytochrome p-450 3a4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole or erythromycin. although the mechanism by
which these arrhythmias are produced remains unclear, the recently reported
ability of these drugs to block outward k+ currents has been suggested as the
cause of their arrhythmogenic effects. alternatively, we have observed that some
h1 antihistamines, including terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx , are able to release histamine from guinea-pig cardiac mast cells. thus, we have proposed that the liberated histamine, acting through an  xxxg1079xxx -stimulating mechanism, can
prolong the action potential duration and hence induce arrhythmogenic effects.
this paper describes experimental observations supporting the hypothesis that
some h1 antihistamines can induce severe cardiac arrhythmias via the local release of histamine.

dale and laidlaw[1] first showed in 1919 that
histamine had profound effects, including increases in the rate and force of contraction, on isolated cat and rabbit hearts. subsequent in vivo studies demonstrated that intravenous administration
of histamine caused tachycardia and changes in
coronary blood flow and contractility, together
with a variety of arrhythmias, in both animals and
humans.[2-4] such observations raise the question

of the possible role of endogenous histamine in
drug-induced cardiotoxicity.
in this context, it has recently been shown that
some histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists (e.g. terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx ), which are able to produce rare but life-threatening arrhythmias in humans by prolonging the action potential duration
(apd), can also induce the release of histamine
from mast cell stores.[5] despite suggestions that
the effect on apd is mainly related to the blockade

llenas et al.

of some delayed rectifier potassium channels, the
mechanism by which these arrhythmias are produced remains unclear. the aim of this paper is to
discuss the effects of histamine on the heart, the
sources of endogenous cardiac histamine, the evidence that endogenous histamine can be released
in sufficient quantities to cause arrhythmogenic effects and, finally, the evidence that certain histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists can indeed liberate
cardiac histamine.
1. the histamine release hypothesis
of antihistamine-induced
cardiac arrhythmias
the idea that histamine released from cardiac
mast cells by some antihistamines could be related
to the reported induction of severe arrhythmias by
these drugs followed the description by tobin et
al.[6] of  xxxd236xxx  overdosage in a child. these
authors observed cardiotoxic effects that ‘resemble
more that caused by histamine than by an antihistamine’ and arrived at the conclusion that such effects might be produced as a consequence of an
activity on the histamine h3 receptors.
as a consequence of this observation, we tested
terfenadine on the isolated guinea-pig ventricular
strip preparation and observed that it induced a
positive inotropic response through a histamine h2
receptor-dependent mechanism.[7] we proposed
the hypothesis that the cardiac arrhythmias produced by some antihistamines could be mediated
through local mast cell histamine release onto cardiac histamine h2 receptors.
this hypothesis is based on 4 facts:
• histamine affects cardiac contractility and can
increase the ventricular apd in the human
heart.[8]
• the amount of histamine present in human cardiac mast cells would be sufficient to produce
cardiac arrhythmias if it were released.[2,9,10]
• cardiac histamine can be released by the two
established ‘arrhythmogenic antihistamines’,
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx .[5]
• although therapeutic plasma concentrations of
terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx  are much lower than

those needed to induce cardiac release of histamine, the extensive accumulation of these
drugs, at least in the animal heart, is more than
sufficient to produce such release and thereby
induce cardiac arrhythmias.[11]
2. effects of histamine on cardiac
contractility and cardiac
action potential
a number of histamine effects on the heart have
been reported in a variety of animal species. these
include increases in the ventricular force of contraction, increases in atrial rate, coronary vasodilation and/or constriction, increased atrioventricular
conduction time, and a variety of arrhythmias.
there is evidence that both histamine h1 and h2
receptors are involved in these effects.[9,12-14]
the contractile effects of histamine on the heart
are very species dependent (table i), and this has
obvious relevance when animal models are used to
predict cardiotoxicity involving endogenous histamine. thus, guinea-pig and human heart are both
very sensitive to histamine, whereas the cat heart
shows an atrial, but not a ventricular, response, and
the dog heart is completely insensitive to the direct
effects of histamine.[15] in the rat, histamine produces a decrease rather than an increase in ventricular contractility.[15] in terms of receptors, histamine h2 receptors are involved in these effects in
human and guinea-pig heart,[16] whereas h1 receptors are involved in the ventricular response in the
pig and rabbit.[3,15]

fig. 1. concentration-response curves for the effect of histamine on action potential in human papillary muscles (r.w. cristwood,
unpublished data).[8] for each parameter, mean absolute control values (0) and mean values obtained after equilibration with
histamine (10–4 mol/l, n = 11; other values, n = 13) ±=sem are shown. apd (90% and 20%) = action potential duration at 90% and
20% repolarisation, respectively; rp = resting potential; os = overshoot. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001 vs baseline values.

effects on action potential have also been investigated. at a threshold concentration of 0.1 mumol/l,
histamine produced concentration-dependent increases in the force of contraction and reductions
in time to peak tension and relaxation time. at the
same time, marked changes in action potential configuration, such as an elevation of the plateau
height and an increase in the duration of the action
potential, reflected in the increase in apd at 20%
of repolarisation (adp 20%) and apd at 90% of
repolarisation (apd 90%), respectively, was
found (fig. 1). however, no effect on dv/dt max or
resting potential has been reported. the largest

effect seems to be on apd, with a mean increase
of 30% at the 10–4 mol/l concentration.[8,17] all effects of histamine on the human heart were  xxxg1079xxx  mediated.
3. cardiac histamine content, its
release by anaphylaxis and the role
of cardiac histamine h2 receptors
clinical evidence indicates that cardiac histamine h2 receptors do not have a physiological role.
this evidence is based on findings that, at doses
blocking the cardiovascular effects of the h2 agonist impromidine, cimetidine has no effect on car-

magnitude of the 48/80 response was equivalent to
the 50% maximal histamine response.[9]
during a severe anaphylactic response in the
guinea-pig, up to 70% of the endogenous histamine
was released from the heart.[9]
4. h1 antihistamines and cardiac
histamine release
histamine release is not generally observed
with  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists. histamine release by
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists was first described in 1946,
when pellerat and murat[25] reported that the blood
histamine level was increased after administration
of various antihistamines. in 1952, arunlakshterfenadine

diovascular parameters in humans at rest or during
exercise. however, histamine is present in various
tissues within the body, including the heart, and
can be released under certain circumstances.[18,19]
when considering a myocardial response to released endogenous histamine, release of both cardiac and extracardiac histamine could be important. however, localised myocardial release would
be expected to result in much higher localised
levels within the heart.
histamine is present in the heart, and is largely
contained within mast cells. table ii compares the
histamine content in human and guinea-pig heart.
although the histamine content of guinea-pig right
atrium is much higher than that of human right
atrium, the contents of the ventricles are more similar.
in order to examine the consequences of released histamine, a number of studies have used the
anaphylactic response in the isolated guinea-pig
heart: animals were sensitised to ovalbumin and,
2 weeks later, the hearts were removed and
perfused. they responded strongly when challenged with ovalbumin, with resulting increases in
sinus rate, left ventricular contractility, aortic flow
and cardiac output.[4,20-24] coronary flow was decreased and there were severe arrhythmias. these
effects occurred soon after the challenge and coincided with histamine release, which peaked at 30
seconds after challenge. the majority of the effects, including the arrhythmias, were histamine h2
receptor mediated.
effects similar to those seen during anaphylaxis
were produced by the potent mast cell histamine
releaser compound 48/80 in the guinea-pig heart.
in human right atrium in vitro, compound 48/80
elicited an inotropic response, which was blocked
by pretreatment with cimetidine (table iii). the

ana[26] reported that diphenhydramine was similar
to compound 48/80 in its ability to release histamine from human lung tissue (releasing up to 36%
of the endogenous histamine).
in 1995, cardelús and colleagues[7] studied the
effects of several histamine  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists: diphenhydramine, d-chlorpheniramine, loratadine, ebastine, cetirizine and terfenadine on ventricular strips from reserpinised guinea-pigs.
the results showed that terfenadine, with a
threshold concentration between 3 and 10 mumol/l,
produced concentration-related increases in the
force of contraction. by contrast, none of the
other antihistamines studied had this effect. the
maximum observed effect with terfenadine at
100 mumol/l represented an increase of 441 ± 42%
(fig. 2).
pretreatment of preparations with cimetidine inhibited the effects of terfenadine (fig. 3), showing
that these are  xxxg1079xxx  mediated. since terfenadine is not a histamine h2 ligand, the effects of terfenadine must be due to the liberation of histamine.[7]

these findings with terfenadine prompted further studies using guinea-pig isolated cardiac mast
cells. the results were reported by heredia et al.[5]
figure 4 shows the release of histamine from
guinea-pig cardiac mast cells produced by antihistamines. the result for terfenadine confirms the
previous evidence for histamine release in the
heart. terfenadine was the most potent compound,
with a steep dose-response curve and an ec50 (concentration that releases 50% of the total histamine
content) value of 13.5 mumol/l and virtually total
release at 30 mumol/l. terfenadine was not alone in
producing this effect, and both  xxxd236xxx  (ec50 =
21.9 mumol/l) and  xxxd1846xxx  (ec50
= 43.5 mumol/l), the main metabolite of loratadine,
also caused the virtual complete release of histamine at 100 mumol/l. loratadine, fexofenadine and
carebastine were without effect up to 100 mumol/l
and ebastine (ec50 >100 mumol/l) induced only
partial release of histamine and showed a very shallow dose-response curve.[5]

5. accumulation of antihistamines
in the heart
concentrations of antihistamines inducing the
release of cardiac histamine in vitro exceed plasma
concentrations seen in humans even under conditions of overdose or metabolic inhibition. nevertheless, some of these agents, particularly  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine, accumulate in cardiac tissue
and can achieve histamine-releasing concentrations. furthermore, certain pathological conditions, e.g. myocardial ischaemia or dilated cardiomyopathy, could facilitate the release in vivo at
even lower concentrations. in fact, patella et al.[27]
have recently reported that the release of histamine
was significantly higher in human heart mast cells
from cardiomyopathy patients than from healthy
controls.
6. conclusions
the data presented support the hypothesis that
cardiac histamine release could, at least in part,
contribute to the adverse cardiac effects of some
antihistamines, such as terfenadine and  xxxd236xxx .
