abstract. caffeine, widely consumed in beverages,
and many xanthine analogs have had a major impact
on biomedical research. caffeine and various analogs,
the latter designed to enhance potency and selectivity
toward specific biological targets, have played key
roles in defining the nature and role of adenosine
receptors, phosphodiesterases, and calcium release
channels in physiological processes. such xanthines
and other caffeine-inspired heterocycles now provide

important research tools and potential therapeutic
agents for intervention in alzheimers disease, asthma, cancer, diabetes, and parkinsons disease. such
compounds also have activity as analgesics, antiinflammatories, antitussives, behavioral stimulants, diuretics/natriuretics, and lipolytics. adverse effects can
include anxiety, hypertension, certain drug interactions, and withdrawal symptoms.

keywords. adenosine receptor, caffeine, calcium, gaba receptor, phosphodiesterase, xanthine.

the stimulant properties of infusions prepared from
coffee beans or tea leaves undoubtedly play a
significant role in the worldwide popularity of such
beverages and of cola drinks to which caffeine is added
as a flavor enhancer [1]. caffeine, the major behavioral stimulant present in coffee, was isolated in 1820
and the correct structure of this methylxanthine was
finally established in the last decade of that century.
however, the targets underlying the behavioral
stimulant properties of methylxanthines, such as
caffeine, were not clearly recognized until 1981,
when correlations of the stimulant properties of
caffeine and various analogs were correlated with
the blockade of adenosine receptors [2]. the behavioral depression elicited by high dosages of caffeine
and by some xanthine analogs was proposed to be due
to inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
[2, 3]. ligands for adenosine receptors were clearly
targets for drug development [4] as were inhibitors for

phosphodiesterase [5]. the biological effects of caffeine are now known to span a wide range of
molecular targets [6], the most important of which
are the following: i) adenosine receptors, where
xanthines act as antagonists; ii) phosphodiesterases,
where xanthines act as inhibitors; iii) calcium release
ryanodine-sensitive channels in the sarcoplasmic and
endoplasmic reticulum, where xanthines act to sensitize the channels to the activation by calcium. iv)
gabaa receptors, where xanthines act as antagonists
at the benzodiazepine-positive modulatory site. there
are many further biological targets at which caffeine
and analogs can act, but those require millimolar
concentrations of caffeine [for coverage of such
targets see refs 6, 7].
caffeine itself is a rather unique compound with very
high solubility in both water and nonpolar organic
solvents. it partitions readily across cell membranes,
rapidly yielding high levels throughout the body,

including the brain [8]. elimination in vivo is virtually
entirely dependent on metabolism to more polar
entities. metabolism in humans leads to paraxanthine,
a xanthine sharing many of the biological activities of
caffeine [2]. the presence of paraxanthine in coffee
beans was reported in 1980 [9]. theophylline, another
metabolite of caffeine and a significant xanthine in tea
leaf infusions, also shares the biological activities of
caffeine [2]. theobromine, the third well-known
natural xanthine, is present in chocolate derived
from cacao beans. it is a weak adenosine antagonist
and only a weak central stimulant [2]. caffeine also is
present in cacao beans, but in much lower amounts.
the structures of the three major natural methylxanthines and of paraxanthine are shown in figure 1. the
various activities of caffeine have led to its extensive
use as a research tool and as a starting point for the
design and synthesis of a wide variety of xanthine and
related heterocyclic analogs as antagonists at adenosine receptors and as inhibitors of phosphodiesterases.

adenosine receptors
in 1969/1970, the stimulatory effects of adenosine on
the generation of  xxxd1773xxx  in brain slices and the
blockade of that effect by caffeine were reported [10,
11]. that the depressant effects of adenosine in heart
could be blocked by caffeine had been reported a few
years earlier[12]. then in 1978, burnstock [13]
formulated the existence of two classes of purinergic
receptors, namely the p1- (adenosine) and the p2(atp) receptors. methylxanthines blocked the p1receptors, while having no effect on the p2-receptors.
functional studies in the late 1970s/early 1980s
provided evidence that the p1-receptors could be
divided into a1-adenosine receptors that were inhibitory to adenylate cyclase and a2-adenosine receptors
that were stimulatory to adenylate cyclase [14, 15] and
then that the a2-adenosine receptors could be divided
into a2a-receptors with high affinities for agonists and
a2b-receptors with low affinity for agonists [16, 17].
another low-affinity adenosine receptor, the a3receptor, was introduced in 1992 [18]. the a3adenosine receptor, like the a1-receptor, was not
only inhibitory to adenylyl cyclase, but could also
stimulate phospholipase c, thereby triggering through

generation of ip3 a calcium signal [19]. the existence
of several adenosine receptor subtypes, all sensitive to
blockade by xanthines, generated extensive development of agonists and selective and potent xanthineinspired antagonists. the therapeutic potential for
both adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists and
the diversity of such synthetic agents was highlighted
for a1- and a2-receptors in 1992 [20], for a3-receptors
in 2000 [21], for all adenosine receptors in 1996 [22]
and for adenosine antagonists in 2001 [23]. there have
been extensive reviews on adenosine receptor agonists, antagonists, and positive modulators and on
possible therapeutic targets. these include, from 2006,
reviews focusing on adenosine receptors as therapeutic targets [24], adenosine receptor antagonists as
potential therapeutics [25], antagonists for a1- and
a2a-receptors [26], antagonists for a2b-receptors and
potential therapeutic applications [27], ligands for
a2b-receptors [28, 29], adenosine receptor ligands as
antiinflammatories [30], and purines as effectors of
adenosine receptors and other biological targets [31].
thus, the present section on adenosine receptors
attempts only to highlight certain xanthines as selective and/or potent antagonists of adenosine receptors.
the affinities of the xanthines highlighted in figures
2 – 5 for a1-, a2a-, a2b- and a3-adenosine receptors
are presented in table 1.
a1-receptors
a range of xanthines selective and potent as antagonists for a1-adenosine receptors have been developed
[24 – 26]. many of the a1-selective xanthines are
characterized by large substituents, such as a phenyl
or cycloalkyl moiety, in the 8-position and by propyl
groups in the 1- and 3-position (see dpcpx, kw3902, and cvt 124 in fig. 2). a carboxyl moiety in
bg 9928 (see fig. 2) improved water solubility and
oral efficacy [32]. introduction of an ionized sulfonic
acid moiety on the 8-phenyl ring resulted in an a1selective antagonist, with only peripheral effects (see
dpspx in fig. 2). the presence of polar moieties in
the 1-, 3- or 7-alkyl substituents greatly reduced or
abolished antagonist activity at adenosine receptors
[33]. however, certain xanthines, such as propentofylline and  xxxd2880xxx , with polar moieties in the 1substituent (see fig. 6), inhibit adenosine uptake [34,
35], thereby potentiating the effects of endogenous

adenosine rather than blocking the activation of
adenosine receptors. a functionalized congener approach to the moiety at the 8-position has resulted in a
variety of xanthine antagonists [36] (see xac in
fig. 2). a logical extension of structural alterations to
the caffeine template was replacement of the xanthine
ring system with other electron-rich heterocycles [see
refs 25, 26]. several have potent and/or selective
antagonist activity at a1-adenosine receptors. for
example, three of the so-called extended xanthines
(see triazolopurine i, ii, and iii in fig. 2) have high
potency and selectivity as a1-antagonists [see refs 23,
25, 37].
a2a-receptors
the selectivity of caffeine analogs for a2a-adenosine
receptors was somewhat increased by the replacement
of one or two methyl groups of caffeine with a propyl
or propargyl substituent [38]. indeed, 3,7-dimethyl-1propargylxanthine [39] (see dmpx in fig. 3) has been
used as a selective a2-antagonist, despite only modest
selectivity. the presence of a 8-cycloalkyl substituent
in caffeine modestly increased selectivity for a2receptors [40]. ultimately, 8-styrylxanthine analogs

proved to be useful, highly selective a2a-receptor
antagonists [41 – 43] (see csc, kw-6002 and kf17837
in fig. 3). a variety of other 8-styrylxanthines selective for a2a-receptors have been developed [44, 45].
the first nonxanthine to be developed as an a2aselective antagonist was a trizoloquinazoline, cgs
15943 [46]. subsequently, a wide range of such
heterocycles have been developed with selectivity as
antagonists of a2a-receptors [see refs 25, 26 and
references therein].
a2b-receptors
there is currently great interest in antagonists selective for a2b-adenosine receptors [27 – 29].  xxxd1999xxx  with a 1-propyl substituent (see fig. 4) represents
a lead xanthine with selectivity toward the a2breceptor [47]. remarkably, an 8-substituted 3-isobutylxanthine (see ipdx in fig. 4) proved very selective
for a2b-receptors [48]. a series of 1-propylxanthines
with 8-phenyl moieties [43] yielded the highly a2bselective antagonist 1-propyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine pbs 1115 [49] (see fig. 4), which would be
active only peripherally. a series of 1,3-dipropylxanthines with functionalized 8-phenyl moieties yielded

mrs 1754, (see fig. 4), a highly a2b-selective antagonist [50]. further development provided cvt-5440
[51], another a2b-selective antagonist (see fig. 4).
further xanthines in which a substituted 8-pyrazolo
ring replaced the substituted 8-phenyl ring of mrs
1754 provided a2b-selective antagonists mre
2030f20 and an 8-pyrazolylxanthine [52, 53] (see
fig. 4). caffeine-inspired nonxanthine heterocyclic
antagonists for a2b-adenosine receptors have also
been developed (see refs. 25, 27, 29, 30]. these include
a variety of 9-deaza-xanthines and 9-deaza-adenines.

xanthines, such as psb-11 [56], the triazolopurine ot7999 [57] and a pyrrolopurine [58] (see fig. 5) have
high affinity and selectivity for a3-receptors. a
pyrazolo-triazolo-pyrimidine, mre 3008f20 (see
fig. 5) has been introduced as a radioligand for a3adenosine receptors [59]. other polyheterocyclic
analogs have been introduced as a3-receptor antagonists as have flavonoids, dihydropyridines, pyridines,
thiazoles, and adenosine analogs [see refs 24, 25].

cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
a3-receptor
the a3-adenosine receptors of rats show relatively
low affinities for caffeine, theophylline and other
xanthines, while those of humans show somewhat
higher affinities [21, 54]. an unusual 3-benzylxanthine
(see xanthine i, fig. 5) has high affinity and selectivity
for a3-receptors [55]. in addition, so-called extended

the discovery and isolation of a cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase was hastened by the finding that
caffeine appeared to enhance the formation of cyclic
amp by the newly discovered enzyme adenylyl
cyclase [60]. the three naturally occurring methylxanthines, namely caffeine, theophylline, and theo-

bromine, were relatively weak competitive inhibitors
[61], and xanthines with substituents other than
methyl were prepared in efforts to enhance potency
[5]. attempts were made to correlate potencies of
xanthines as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and pharmacological effects, such as lipolytic effects in adipocytes [62], relaxant effects on tracheal smooth muscle
[63], contraction of striated muscle [64], and anxiogenic effects [65]. it was clear that other effects of
xanthines on adenosine receptors, calcium release,

and perhaps prostaglandin synthesis confounded any
interpretations. indeed, the lipolytic effects of xanthines were shown to be due to blockade of the a1adenosine receptors that were inhibitory to adenylyl
cyclase [66].
 xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx , see fig. 6) became established as a potent phosphodiesterase
inhibitor that, however, was even more potent as an
adenosine receptor antagonist [3]. the phosphodiesterase isozymes (pdes) were found to be expressed to

varying degrees in different tissues and the goal
became the discovery of isozyme-selective agents
[67].  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) proved
relatively unselective toward five of the isozymes
[68]. however, a recent report indicated that  xxxd2388xxx 
has no effect on pde8 [69]. extensive pioneering
studies on alkylxanthines by wells and colleagues [70,
71] led to xanthines with some selectivity, namely 3isobutyl-1-isoamylxanthine (iix, see fig. 6) toward
pde4 and 8-methoxymethylibmx (8-meoch2ibmx, see fig. 6) toward pde1 [63]. iix was
relatively weak as an antagonist at adenosine receptors [72, 73]. alkylxanthines that were potent inhibitors of pde4 all appeared to be behavioral depressants [3, 72].
there are now at least 12 pdes [74, 75]. the
therapeutic potential of selective phosphodiesterase
inhibitors has been reviewed frequently over the past
three decades. two such reviews appeared in 2005 [76,
77]. because multiple isozymes often occur in the
same cell type and because there are few if any specific
inhibitors, therapeutic targeting remains difficult. the
following are broad generalizations for inhibitor
targets: antiinflammatory, asthma treatment, and
immunosuppressant ( xxxg1695xxx , 4); angina, hypertension,
and cardiac failure (pde2, 3); antithrombotic

(pde4); vasodilation, hypertension, and erectile
dysfunction (pde5); and vascular relaxant (pde1)
[see refs 31, 74 – 77].
unlike the adenosine receptor field where most
antagonists owe their origin to caffeine/theophylline
as lead compounds, most of the current phosphodiesterase inhibitors are not derived from xanthines [see
refs 76, 77]. as mentioned above, iix and 8-meoch2ibmx are somewhat selective for pde4 and pde1,
respectively. denbutylline, doxofylline, and arofylline
are somewhat selective for pde4, and kmup-1 [78]
for  xxxg1695xxx , 4, while  xxxd2880xxx  and propentofylline
are characterized as weak pde4 inhibitors (for
structures see fig. 6). a variety of other xanthines
(r- xxxd2497xxx , isobufylline, torbaphylline, bamiphylline and furafylline) have been introduced, some with
antiinflammatory activity. the extended xanthine
sch51866 (pde1) [79], the extended 8-meo-xanthine (pde5) [80] and an 8-m-sulfamidophenylxanthine (pde5) [81] have been developed (see
fig. 6 for structures). finally, zaprinast, analogous to
a 2-phenylhypoxanthine (see fig. 6) and selective for
pde1 and pde5, represented a lead structure for
development of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction
[82]. a number of ring-extended xanthines with
nanomolar potency at pde5 have now been developed [see refs 80, 81]. many of the xanthines that
inhibit phosphodiesterases are also antagonists at
adenosine receptors and block adenosine uptake [see
refs 7, 34, 35].

calcium release
caffeine continues to be widely used as a research tool
to elicit release of intracellular calcium through
activation in consort with calcium of the ryanodinesensitive calcium release channels of the endoplasmic
and sarcoplasmic reticulum [see ref 7]. decades ago
caffeine had been found to cause muscle contractures
through release of intracellular calcium [83, 84].
caffeine at the millimolar concentrations required
to cause activation of ryanodine-sensitive calcium
channels has many other effects on calcium homeostasis [see ref. 7] and hence cannot be used as a
selective research tool for activation of ryanodinesensitive channels. reports on inhibition of ip3elicited calcium release by caffeine have appeared
[85 – 87], and enhancement of capacitative calcium
entry by caffeine has been reported [88, 89].
there have been only a few studies on structureactivity relationships for the efficacy/potency of
xanthines in affecting intracellular or intravesicular
calcium [90 – 92]. in human pheochromocytoma cells,
two xanthines, 1-propyl- and 1-propargyl-theobro-

mine (see fig. 7), were about fourfold more potent
than caffeine [90]. in sea urchin eggs, a 7-oxoheptylxanthine (see fig. 7) was about fourfold more potent
than caffeine [91]. caffeine enhances the binding of
[3h]ryanodine to calcium-release channels [93]. in an
extensive series of 30 xanthines, the most efficacious in
enhancing [3h]ryanodine binding to vesicles of rabbit
muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum [94] was 1-hexyltheobromine (see fig. 7). several other xanthines, including 1-propargyltheobromine were somewhat more
efficacious at 1.5 mm than caffeine. in a similar study

with 35 xanthines, only 7-propyltheophylline (see
fig. 7) was slightly more efficacious  xxxd1891xxx  mm than
caffeine [95]. it would appear unlikely that a xanthine
much more potent and selective than caffeine for the
ryanodine-sensitive calcium-release channel will be
developed.

100] and activity similar to that of caffeine at
phosphodiesterases [3] and at the ryanodine-sensitive
calcium release channels [95]. many of the xanthines
at 1 mm stimulated binding [35s]tbps binding to the
picrotoxinin site of the gabaa receptor, as did
caffeine, while others had no effect or inhibited
binding [95]. it would appear that prospects for
developing a xanthine with potent and selective
effects on gabaa receptors are poor.
a comparison of xanthines as blockers of gaba- and
glycine-mediated chloride currents in rat hippocampal neurous indicated the caffeine was several-fold
more potent against the glycine response (ic50
450 mm) than against the gaba response [101].
theophylline had a similar potency to caffeine, while
 xxxd2880xxx  (see fig. 6) was twofold more potent
than caffeine against the glycine response.  xxxd2880xxx  was later shown to have potency similar to that of
caffeine for inhibition of [3h]diazepam binding to
gabaa receptors [95].

gabaa receptors
caffeine is one of many compounds that interact with
gabaa receptors. such compounds include the
alkaloid antagonist bicucculline, the picrotoxinin
channel blockers, the barbiturates and steroids that
increase channel open time, and the benzodiazepine
allosteric positive modulators [96, 97]. there have
been limited studies on xanthine interactions with
gabaa receptors since the initial report in 1979 on
the inhibition of [3h]diazepam binding by caffeine
[98]. conversely, at that time, diazepam was found to
antagonize caffeine-induced convulsions [99]. further
studies indicated that caffeine and theophylline act as
antagonists or perhaps reverse agonists at benzodiazepine sites, while also interacting with the picrotoxinin and gaba sites [see ref. 95]. a series of 23
xanthines has been studied for effects on the binding
of ligands to the benzodiazepine and picrotoxinin sites
of gabaa receptors in mouse cerebral cortical
membranes [95]. caffeine had an ic50 versus
[3h]diazepam of 500 mm, while two xanthines, namely
1-propargyl-theobromine and 1,3-dipropargyl-7methylxanthine (see fig. 8) were nearly fivefold
more potent. however, both of these xanthines have
relatively potent activity at adenosine receptors [38,

there are many reports on other potential sites of
action for caffeine [see refs 6, 7]. these include several
ion channels, neurotransmitter release, and various
enzymes, but millimolar concentrations of caffeine are
usually required. the effect for ion channels and
enzymes is usually inhibitory. however, stimulation of
the na/k-atpase by caffeine and theophylline occurs
at millimolar concentrations [102] and an apparent
activation of capacitative calcium entry [88, 89, 103]
and calcium-activated potassium channels [104] by
caffeine have been reported. caffeine appeared to
sensitize a mg-atpase to the stimulatory effects of
calcium in cardiac myofibrils [105].

therapeutic prospects
there are several major therapeutic targets toward
which xanthines and heterocyclic xanthine analogs are

being directed. some of the molecular targets for such
xanthines are as follows:
1) alzheimers disease: a2a- and a2b- adenosine
receptor antagonists;
2) asthma – antiinflammatories: a1-, a2a-, and a2badenosine receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors;
3) behavioral targets – antidepressant, anxiolytic,
cognitive enhancement, neuroprotection: adenosine
receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors;
4) cancer: g2 checkpoint inhibitors;
5) diabetes: a2b-adenosine receptor antagonists;
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase inhibitors;  xxxg651xxx  inhibitors;
6) pain: a2a- and a2b-adenosine receptor antagonists,
phosphodiesterase inhibitors;
7) parkinsonism: a2a-adenosine receptor antagonists,
phosphodiesterase inhibitors;
8) renal effects – diuretics: a1- and a2a- adenosine
receptor antagonists;
9) respiratory targets – antitussives, apnea, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis: adenosine receptor antagonists.
the following provides an overview of some of the
current literature in these areas.
alzheimers disease
the consumption of caffeine-containing beverages
appeared to possibly confer some protective effects
from alzheimers disease [106]. in recent studies
with model alzheimer mice, chronic caffeine protected against cognitive impairment and resulted in
reduced brain levels of b-amyloid protein [107]. in
cortical neurons from model alzheimer mice, the
caffeine-elicited release of intracellular calcium was
significantly greater than that in neurons from
control mice [108]. a variety of therapeutic interventions are being explored for treatment of alzheimers disease; however, most of them involve
cholinergic functions [109]. nevertheless, a2b-adenosine receptor antagonists have been proposed as
possible therapeutics for alzheimers disease [110].
both caffeine and the selective nonxanthine a2aadenosine receptor antagonist  xxxd3558xxx  protected
rat cerebellar neurons from the toxic effects of bamyloid protein [111].  xxxd3558xxx  is a triazolotriazine [112] related in structure to the widely used a2areceptor antagonist triazoloquinazoline cgs15943
[46]. the phosphodiesterase inhibitor propentofylline (see figure 6) has cognitive-enhancing effects
and thus might be beneficial for alzheimers disease
[see however ref. 113].

asthma – antiinflammatories
the xanthines theophylline and  xxxd1999xxx  have
been used therapeutically for asthma, and other
agents that target a2b-adenosine receptors are being
sought for the treatment of asthma [see refs 114, 115].
asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition and
caffeine and other xanthines, such as theophylline,
 xxxd2880xxx , and  xxxd2497xxx  (see fig. 6), do have
immunosuppressant effects and thus may have utility
for autoimmune diseases [see ref. 116]. a recent
review covers subtype selective adenosine receptor
agonists and antagonists as antiinflammatory agents
[30]. other xanthines have been proposed to have
potential for treatment of asthma, emphysema, and
chronic bronchitis. these include cvt-5440 [117] and
kmup-3 [118] (see figs 4, 6). xanthines functionalized with alkylpiperazines in the 7-position of theophylline or the 3-position of theobromine were
studied in 1985 as antihistaminics for the treatment
of bronchospasm [119]. activation of a nuclear
enzyme  xxxg1667xxx  appears to
be associated with inflammatory diseases, and paraxanthine (see fig. 1) was a relatively potent inhibitor,
while caffeine was weak [120].
behavior targets – antidepressant – anxiolytic –
cognitive enhancement – neuroprotection
the behavioral stimulant properties of caffeine undoubtedly underlie the consumption of coffee and
other caffeine-containing beverages by many individuals worldwide. caffeine is perceived as increasing
alertness and wakefulness, combating fatigue, and
generally providing a sense of well-being. true
addiction does not seem to occur although there are
withdrawal symptoms [121]. at high doses and in
certain individuals, unpleasant effects, including anxiety, occur. the molecular targets underlying the
behavioral effects of caffeine have been extensively
investigated, primarily in rodents. while blockade of
adenosine receptors is clearly paramount in the
behavioral effects of caffeine, the relative role of the
subtypes remains under investigation [see ref. 122].
the dopaminergic reward system is closely involved
[123]. the extensive on-going research on behavioral
effects of caffeine and other xanthines and the
implications for treatment of depression, anxiety,
cognitive impairment, ischemic effects of stroke, and
even drug dependency and schizophrenia is beyond
the scope of the present overview [see ref. 124]. it
should be noted that the acute and chronic effects of
caffeine can be quite different [125]. most of the
central effects of caffeine at levels attained from
beverages are due to blockade of adenosine receptors
[121].

recent behavioral studies include that of the selective
a2a-receptor antagonist kw-6002 (see fig. 3) [126].
 xxxd2880xxx  and propentofylline (see fig. 6) ameliorate brain ischemic effects in mice paradigms [127,
128]. the anxiolytic effects of an extended-ring
xanthine, containing an arylpiperazine moiety (see
fig. 9) appears due to agonist activity at serotonin
receptors [129]. a xanthine, fenetylline, containing an
amphetamine moiety (see fig. 9) has been used
therapeutically in place of amphetamines [130] and
now has become a drug of abuse. a recent report
focused on the possibility that a2a-receptor antagonists might be used in problems of addiction [131].

cancer
there is extensive literature on the possible anticancer
activity of caffeine and other xanthines [see ref. 132
and references therein]. recently, the antimetastatic
effects of caffeine in a mouse mammary tumor model
were reported [133] as were further studies on the
inhibition by caffeine of ultraviolet-induced skin
tumors in hairless mice [134]. caffeine is well-known
to be an inhibitor of the g2 checkpoint for repair of
damaged dna [135]. in cancer cells defective for
tumor suppressor protein p53, the g1 checkpoint for
repair is defective. thus, caffeine can enhance toxicity
of tumor cells to dna-damaging treatment by blocking the g2 checkpoint. caffeine and a series of
xanthines were assayed for g2 checkpoint inhibition

[136]. however, even at millimolar concentrations
most were inactive or less active than caffeine, with
only 1-ethyl- and 1-propyl-theobromine being somewhat more active than caffeine. a number were
cytotoxic.
diabetes
a2b-adenosine receptor antagonists have been suggested to have potential for treatment of type 2
diabetes [137], based on reported effects of adenosine
receptor antagonists on glucose in rodents. several
relatively potent 1,8-dibenzyl-3-butyl- xanthines (see
fig. 9) were developed as inhibitors of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting step in
hepatic gluconeogenesis [138]. several studies have
indicated that the antiinflammatory xanthine  xxxd2497xxx  (see fig. 6) has antidiabetic effects in a nonobese
diabetic mouse model [139, 140] and has protective
effects on pancreatic b-cells [see ref. 141 and references therein].  xxxd2880xxx  also has antidiabetic
effects in the mouse model [142]. attempts to
correlate caffeine consumption and risk of type 2
diabetes have been inconsistent (see ref. 143 and refs.
therein). indeed, reports that caffeine ingestion
caused a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake have appeared [143, 144]. recently, a series
of xanthines (see 8-piperidinyl-xanthine fig. 9) and
related heterocycles were introduced as potent and
selective inhibitors of  xxxg651xxx , a
clinically relevant target for treatment of type 2
diabetes [see ref. 145 and references therein].
pain
caffeine has a long history as an analgesic adjuvant
[146, 147]. other adenosine receptor antagonists have
antinociceptive effects with a2b-receptors appearing
to be the targets [148]. some of the xanthines that are
a2b-antagonists and thus perhaps represent lead
compounds are shown in figure 4. there are a
multitude of pathological and acute pain states and a
variety of receptors, including opioid, adenosine,
cannabinoid, galanin, gaba, glycine,  xxxd428xxx , and
nicotinic receptors, and ion channels including sodium
and calcium, that represent therapeutic targets [149 –
151].
parkinsons disease
the potential therapeutic treatment of parkinsons
diseases by a2a-adenosine receptor antagonists has
been the subject of recent comprehensive reviews
[152 – 154]. a number of xanthines (csc, kw 6002,
kf17837, see figs 3 and 9) and nonxanthines (msx-2,
sch 58261, zm241385 [25]) are under development
as antiparkinsonism agents. all are selective for a2areceptors as is an 8-triazoyladenine, st 1535, which

review article

2163

represents another potential new agent [155]. however, a2a-receptor antagonists represent only one of
several therapeutic approaches to parkinsons disease
[see ref. 156]. selective inhibition of monoamine
oxidase b represents another approach, and the a2areceptor antagonist 3-chlorostyrylcaffeine (csc, see
fig. 3) was recently reported to be a potent inhibitor of
that enzyme [157]. caffeine consumption in beverages has been proposed to be associated with a
reduced risk of parkinsons disease [see ref. 152 and
references therein) and caffeine in rodent models has
protective effects [see ref. 158].
renal effects – diuretics
the diuretic and natriuretic effects of caffeine and
theophylline are well-known and both have been used
to treat edema associated with congestive heart failure
[see ref. 159 and references therein]. the diurectic
effect seems likely due to antagonism of a1-adenosine
receptors [see ref. 160 and references therein). thus,
the highly selective a1-adenosine receptor antagonist
cvt-124 (see fig. 2) appears potentially useful as a
diuretic in patients with congestive heart failure [161 –
163]. blockade of a2a-receptors may be of value in
prevention of hepatic cirrhosis [164], and  xxxd2880xxx  through phosphodiesterase inhibition can provide
renal protection [see ref. 165 and references therein].
respiratory targets – antitussives, apnea, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis
the antitussive effects of theobromine are well-known
[see ref. 166 and references therein]. the synthetic
theobromine analog ch 13584 (see fig. 9) has been
developed with antitussive activity in a guinea pig
model [166, 167]. caffeine and to a lesser extent
theophylline are widely used for the apnea that
frequently occurs in premature infants, with a minimum
of adverse effects [168]. the respiratory stimulatory
effects of the xanthine are undoubtedly due to antagonism at adenosine receptors of central respiratory
centers [169]. indeed, in the periphery, caffeine through
blockade of a2-adenosine receptors of the carotid body
has inhibitory effects on respiration [see ref 170 and
references therein]. chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, an inflammatory disease characterized by
airflow obstruction and an alteration in adenosine
receptors represents another target for intervention
with adenosine receptor agonists or antagonists [see ref.
171 and references therein]. the xanthine 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx, see fig. 2), wellestablished as a potent, selective a1-adenosine receptor
antagonist, was shown to stimulate chloride-efflux from
cystic fibrosis cells, and thus appeared as a lead
compound for therapeutic use in treatment of cystic
fibrosis [172]. further studies demonstrated that the

2164

j. w. daly

effect was not due to antagonism of adenosine receptors, but to activation of so-called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (cftr) channels by dpcpx
and its diallyl analog, 8-cyclohexyl-1,3-diallylxanthine
[173]. a wide range of xanthines have been tested for
activation of the cftr channel [174]. several, including theophylline,  xxxd1999xxx ,  xxxd2880xxx , and
 xxxd2388xxx , activated the channel. all were tested at 500
mm. in another study, dpcpx was not found to activate
whole-cell conductance in cells expressing cftr
channels [175].

conclusion

the broad range of effects of caffeine, both as a
research tool and as a lead structure for the synthesis
and study of diverse xanthine and other related
heterocyclics, has had far-reaching impact on biomedical research. research continues, with a focus in
several therapeutic areas in which development of
further selective and potent xanthines as antagonists
of adenosine receptors and as phosphodiesterase
inhibitors may have further impact.
