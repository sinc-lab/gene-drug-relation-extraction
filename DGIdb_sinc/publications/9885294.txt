the human  xxxg12xxx   xxxg13xxx  translocates sphingolipid analogs across the plasma membrane.  recently, we have provided evidence that the abc-transporter  xxxg10xxx  p-glycoprotein translocates analogs of various lipid classes across the apical plasma membrane of polarized llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells transfected with  xxxg10xxx  cdna. here, we show that expression of the basolateral abc-transporter  xxxg13xxx  (the  xxxg12xxx ) induced lipid transport to the exoplasmic leaflet of the basolateral plasma membrane of llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells at 15 degreesc. c6-nbd-glucosylceramide synthesized on the cytosolic side of the golgi complex, but not c6-nbd-sphingomyelin synthesized in the golgi lumen, became accessible to depletion by bsa in the basal culture medium. this suggests the absence of vesicular traffic and direct translocation of c6-nbd-glucosylceramide by  xxxg13xxx  across the basolateral membrane. in line with this, transport of the lipid to the exoplasmic leaflet depended on the intracellular glutathione concentration and was inhibited by the  xxxg13xxx -inhibitors  xxxd3256xxx  and indomethacin, but not by the  xxxg10xxx  p-glycoprotein inhibitor  xxxd3488xxx . in contrast to the broad substrate specificity of the  xxxg10xxx  p-glycoprotein,  xxxg13xxx  selectively transported c6-nbd-glucosylceramide and c6-nbd-sphingomyelin, the latter only when it was released from the golgi lumen by brefeldin a. this shows the specific nature of the lipid translocation. we conclude that the transport activity of  xxxg10xxx  p-glycoprotein and  xxxg13xxx  must be taken into account in studies on the transport of lipids to the cell surface.
