 xxxd3259xxx  in established experimental
diabetes: a follow-up study
paul van der sloot, andrew mizisin and douglas zochodne

abstract: background: in two previous studies we have demonstrated prevention of electrophysiological abnormalities of nerve in experimental stz ( xxxd3249xxx )-induced diabetes (ed) of rats using
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents: indomethacin and  xxxd3259xxx .  xxxd3259xxx  might benefit ed because it
inhibits both cyclo-oxygenase and  xxxg111xxx . methods: in this work, we examined whether 1
month of  xxxd3259xxx  treatment reversed or improved established biochemical and electrophysiological
abnormalities in experimental diabetes of 3 months duration.  xxxd3259xxx -treated diabetic rats (6.0 mg/kg
5/7 days weekly by gavage) were compared to untreated diabetics, nondiabetic controls and  xxxd3259xxx 
treated control rats. results: diabetic rats developed slowing of conduction velocity in caudal sensory,
sural sensory, caudal motor and sciatic tibial motor fibers.  xxxd3259xxx  improved caudal motor and, to a
lesser extent sural sensory conduction but not caudal sensory or sciatic tibial motor conduction.  xxxd3259xxx 
did not alter sciatic sugars or polyols. conclusions:  xxxd3259xxx  provided modest improvement in some
indices of experimental neuropathy in this reversal study, but there was less efficacy than in the preventative study. reversal paradigms should be examined in all experimental therapies for diabetic neuropathy.

in previous work, we demonstrated that the oral administration of  xxxd3259xxx , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent used in
human arthritis, prevented motor and sensory conduction
deficits in experimental stz ( xxxd3249xxx )-induced diabetes
of rats.1 postulated mechanisms of this benefit included its possible role as an  xxxg111xxx  inhibitor, with or without additional benefits from inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase. 14  xxxd3259xxx 
was given at the outset of diabetes.
in this work we evaluated the impact of  xxxd3259xxx  treatment
on established stz diabetes in rats of 12 weeks duration to
determine possible reversal of electrophysiological abnormalities and its impact on the polyol pathway.

floored cages with free access to rat chow and water. diabetes
was induced by a single injection of  xxxd3249xxx  (stz; 65
mg/kg ip) with selection only of rats with hyperglycemia greater
than or equal to 16.0 mmol/l throughout the experiment.
control nondiabetic rats received the citrate buffer stz carrier
only. the model was identical to that used in previous studies in
our laboratory.15 glucose levels were measured from the caudal
vein on whole blood using a glucometer (accuchek urn;
boehringer mannheim, canada; dorval, quebec) and confirmed
using fresh plasma and a glucose oxidase method (ektachem
dt60 ii analyzer; kodak; rochester, ny). electrophysiological

recordings were made at 8, 12 and 16 weeks from sciatic-tibial
motor fibers, caudal motor and caudal sensory fibers in vivo
with the near nerve subcutaneous temperature maintained at 37°
c. at the endpoint of 16 weeks, the sural nerve was resected for
measurements of in vitro sensory conduction. details of these
electrophysiological techniques have been previously published.6
after the electrophysiological measurements, the sciatic nerves
were resected and fast frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane, then stored at -70° c, and later shipped on dry ice to the
university of california, san diego for sugar and polyol measurements by gas chromatography (am). technical details of
the measurement procedures have been published.7
 xxxd3259xxx  treatment was begun (6 mg/kg suspended in 0.5%
 xxxd2609xxx  and 0.2% sodium benzoate and given by gavage
tube five times weekly) following the electrophysiological studies
at 12 weeks after stz or citrate injection and continued for 4
weeks to endpoint. four groups of rats were studied: nondiabetic
controls, nondiabetic controls given  xxxd3259xxx , untreated diabetics
and diabetics given  xxxd3259xxx . cataract development was graded by
visual inspection of each eye: 0-absent, l-mild changes, 2-dense
cataract (maximum score-4). results were compared using a oneway analysis of variance (anova) at each time point with post
anova comparisons performed using a two tailed student's ttest. the null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05.
results

diabetic rats developed cataracts, gained less weight than nondiabetics and had elevated glycated hemoglobin levels (table 1).
electrophysiological abnormalities in diabetic rats after 16 weeks
were slowing of conduction velocities in caudal sensory fibers,
caudal motor fibers, sciatic-tibial motor fibers and sural sensory
fibers (table 2). diabetic sciatic nerves had elevated levels of glu-

cose, fructose and sorbitol with reduced myo-inositol (table 1).
 xxxd3259xxx  treatment did not influence hyperglycemia, or glycated hemoglobin values.  xxxd3259xxx  treated diabetic rats
weighed less than untreated diabetics. there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower cataract score following  xxxd3259xxx 
treatment but no impact on sciatic levels of sugars or polyols.
 xxxd3259xxx  had no significant impact on conduction velocity
slowing of diabetic rats in caudal sensory fibers or sciatic-tibial motor fibers.  xxxd3259xxx  treatment resulted in a rise in conduction velocity in caudal motor fibers rendering values higher
than untreated diabetic rats and not significantly different than
control values by the 16 week endpoint. in sural fibers recorded in vitro, at 16 weeks there was also an improvement in conduction velocity of  xxxd3259xxx  treated diabetic rats such that
values were not significantly different than those of controls.
 xxxd3259xxx  had no influence on electrophysiological or biochemical measurements in nondiabetic rats (data not shown).
discussion

experimental therapy for diabetic neuropathy probably
should fulfill several criteria before being applied to human clinical trials. the agent should prevent neuropathic deficits, but
more importantly, be able to prevent their progression after they
already exist. of the large number of experimental agents tested
using the stz rat model of diabetes, only a few have undergone
both preventative and reversal testing paradigms.8"10 interesting
discrepancies may occur comparing these types of evaluations.
 xxxd3259xxx , of three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents tested
in stz diabetes ( xxxd3259xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx  and indomethacin) is the
first to be subjected to a reversal paradigm. 1 ' 5 " reversal of
established electrophysiological abnormalities in diabetes by
 xxxd3259xxx  was less impressive than its preventative action. of

two motor and two sensory territories tested, benefits were
only observed in one each of these territories. this indicates
that once neuropathic abnormalities have developed, they may
be more difficult to reverse. inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase to
reduce thromboxane vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation,
may be the mechanism of  xxxd3259xxx 's preventative role.12 with
 xxxd3259xxx , we did not observe the worsening in conduction velocity in control or diabetic rats suggested by cameron et al. l 3 m to
result from inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis by  xxxd2141xxx .
in human clinical trials for stroke or other thrombotic disorders
cyclo-oxygenase inhibition has not been associated with exacerbations attributable to prostacyclin deficiency.
no impact on the polyol pathway was observed following
 xxxd3259xxx  treatment despite previous reports suggesting that
 xxxd3259xxx  was an important  xxxg111xxx  inhibitor in human
lens with a potency approaching that of  xxxd3228xxx .2-3 despite the
short duration of  xxxd3259xxx  treatment in the present work, some
improvement in this pathway would have been expected if its
action is through this mechanism.

an equally important criterion that should be applied to testing of experimental agents in diabetes is safety. there are important concerns in applying nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
in human diabetic subjects including risks of gastrointestinal
hemorrhage and possible worsening of diabetic nephropathy.15
although many diabetic patients use these agents for arthritic
conditions, neuropathy therapy would require long term and continuous use. although we do not advocate an abandonment of
this therapeutic approach, it may have to be considered in conjunction with prophylaxis against gastrointestinal inflammation
and ulceration. this consideration is not unique to this potential
group of therapeutic agents in neuropathy. for example, similar
concerns should be applied to a large number of vasoactive
agents being tested in the stz model for amelioration of diabetic
nerve conduction abnormalities. , 0 l 6 n these approaches may fail
to consider risks in diabetic patients from autonomic neuropathy
and postural hypotension-related falls, myocardial ischemia and
cerebral hypoperfusion that would be exacerabated by the superimposition of vasodilating agents.

le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques

based on the results of the current work, we suggest a cautious approach in considering the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for human trials of diabetic neuropathy.
our findings suggest that enthusiasm for new treatments should
be tempered by rigorous preventative and reversal trials in an
appropriate model and careful clinical thoughts about potential
safety, should the agent look promising.
