treating the metabolic syndrome:  xxxd3303xxx  as a peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activator

abstract hypertension commonly occurs as part of a
genetically complex disorder of carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism known as the metabolic syndrome. most current antihypertensive drugs appear ineffective against the
metabolic syndrome, which is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and death in affected patients.
 xxxg99xxx  can influence the activity of certain genes
and cellular and biochemical pathways that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome.
however, as a class,  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockers
(arbs) have proven only minimally to modestly effective in ameliorating the disturbances in carbohydrate and
lipid metabolism that characterise the metabolic syndrome. recent preclinical studies indicate that the arb
 xxxd3303xxx  acts as a selective peroxisome proliferator-

activated receptor-gamma ( xxxg1807xxx ) modulator when tested at concentrations that might be achievable with oral
doses recommended for treatment of hypertension; this
property does not appear to be shared by other arbs.
 xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear receptor that influences the expression of multiple genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism and is an attractive therapeutic target for the
prevention and control of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. in cellular transactivation
assays,  xxxd3303xxx  functioned as a partial agonist of
 xxxg1807xxx  and achieved 25–30% of maximal receptor activation attained with conventional  xxxg1807xxx  ligands.
preclinical and clinical studies indicate that administration of  xxxd3303xxx  can improve carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism without causing the side effects that accompany full  xxxg1807xxx  activators. if the preliminary data are
supported by the results of ongoing large-scale clinical
studies,  xxxd3303xxx  could have a central role in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, diabetes
and atherosclerosis.

hypertension is often associated with an array of other
risk factors for cardiovascular disease including visceral
obesity, insulin resistance, disordered glucose metabolism
and dyslipidaemia, collectively termed ‘the metabolic
syndrome’ [1–3]. this clustering of risk factors is present
in about 15–25% of individuals in industrialised countries
[4–8] and carries a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. the metabolic syndrome

s10

t.w. kurtz:  xxxd3303xxx  in the metabolic syndrome

increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by
five- to nine-fold [9] and of cardiovascular disease and
death by two- to four-fold [5, 6].
for the most part, the drugs currently used to lower
blood pressure are not considered to be effective against the
metabolic syndrome [1]. this is not surprising given that the
antihypertensive agents in use today were developed before
the connection between hypertension and the metabolic syndrome was well recognised. thus, current antihypertensive
drugs were designed exclusively to lower blood pressure
rather than to treat the complex metabolic disorder of which
hypertension is only a part.
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors,
which block  xxxg99xxx  formation, and  xxxg99xxx 
receptor blockers (arbs), which prevent the binding of
 xxxg99xxx  to the type 1 receptor, are both widely used
for the treatment of high blood pressure and prevention of
cardiovascular disease. in addition to causing vasoconstriction,  xxxg99xxx  affects the transcription of multiple
genes concerned with cell growth and proliferation,
atherogenesis and thrombus formation (table 1) [1].
pharmacological blockade of the renin–angiotensin system
has been shown to inhibit  xxxg99xxx -induced changes
in the expression of a variety of genes [10–16]. recent
observations suggest that  xxxg99xxx  receptor blockade
may also affect the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism [17]. thus far, however, neither ace
inhibitors nor arbs have been considered in conventional
treatment programmes for managing insulin resistance and
dyslipidaemia in patients with diabetes or the metabolic
syndrome.
large-scale prospective studies in patients with hypertension have recently begun to explore the ability of ace
inhibitors to decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes. in the
heart outcomes prevention evaluation (hope) study, for
example, a significantly lower incidence of new-onset
diabetes was observed among the patients treated with the
ace inhibitor ramipril (3.6%) compared with those
receiving placebo (5.4%; relative risk 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.51, 0.85; p<0.001) [18]. in addition, in
the captopril prevention project (cappp) [19] and in the

antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (allhat) study [20], the rate of
new-onset diabetes was lower in patients treated with an
ace inhibitor than in those treated with diuretics, betablockers or calcium channel blockers. although further
mechanistic studies are required, experiments investigating the influence of ace inhibitors on glucose metabolism have suggested that the antidiabetic effects of these
compounds may involve more than just reductions in
 xxxg99xxx  levels and could involve alterations in
kinin– xxxd2738xxx  pathways [21–23].
the effects of arbs on insulin resistance and
dyslipidaemia have been investigated in several wellconducted randomised, controlled studies. for example,
in the antihypertensive treatment and lipid profile in a
north sweden efficacy evaluation (alpine) study, the
metabolic effects of the arb candesartan and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide ( xxxd2294xxx ) were compared over a 1year period in 392 hypertensive patients, 370 of whom
had not previously been treated with antihypertensive
agents [24]. at baseline, both treatment groups had nearly identical fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin and
serum triglyceride concentrations. after 12 months’ candesartan therapy, there were no significant changes in
glucose, insulin or triglyceride levels, whereas those
patients treated with  xxxd2294xxx  for 12 months displayed significant (p<0.001) increases. there was also a greater
decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in
the  xxxd2294xxx -treated patients compared with those treated
with candesartan. over the duration of the study, eight
patients in the  xxxd2294xxx  group developed diabetes and 18
were diagnosed as having metabolic syndrome as
opposed to only one (p=0.030) and five (p=0.007)
patients, respectively, in the candesartan group. the
authors concluded that candesartan was ‘metabolically
neutral’ in terms of glucose and lipid metabolism, but that
 xxxd2294xxx  aggravated the metabolic profile in these newly
diagnosed hypertensive patients.
the losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in
hypertension (life) study evaluated the incidence of
new-onset type 2 diabetes as a secondary endpoint in 7998

t.w. kurtz:  xxxd3303xxx  in the metabolic syndrome

 xxxg1807xxx  and metabolic syndrome
 xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role
in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and is a proven
therapeutic target in the treatment of insulin resistance,
diabetes and metabolic syndrome [36–40]. human
genetic linkage studies have revealed that mutations in
the  xxxg1807xxx  receptor gene produce severe hyperinsulinaemia and the metabolic syndrome, reinforcing the central role of  xxxg1807xxx  in maintaining normal glucose and
lipid metabolism [41].
 xxxg1807xxx  exists as a complex with the retinoid x receptor
(rxr) within the cell nucleus. once activated, the complex influences the expression of key target genes that
mediate a variety of effects on fatty acid metabolism,
insulin sensitivity and adipocyte differentiation [1, 36, 42].
two  xxxg1807xxx  activators – pioglitazone and rosiglitazone – have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity,
decrease serum fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations
and, in some cases, increase levels of the beneficial high-

density lipoprotein cholesterol; these agents are already
licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. however,
these thiazolidinedione ligands of  xxxg1807xxx  have limited
effects on blood pressure and, furthermore, are associated
with side effects, such as fluid retention, weight gain,
oedema and heart failure, that limit their value in the
treatment of prediabetic and diabetic individuals with
hypertension [43–45].

 xxxd3303xxx  as a  xxxg1807xxx  activator. preclinical evidence
recently, it was reported that  xxxd3303xxx , a clinically
approved arb with well-documented efficacy in blood
pressure reduction, may share some structural homology
with the  xxxg1807xxx  ligand pioglitazone and have the capacity
to activate  xxxg1807xxx  [42, 46]. in cellular  xxxg1807xxx  transactivation assays,  xxxd3303xxx  was found to produce significant
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  when tested at concentrations that
may be achieved in plasma following administration of
doses used for the treatment of essential hypertension (fig.
1). by contrast, the other commercially available arbs –
losartan, eprosartan, candesartan,  xxxd3487xxx , olmesartan
and irbesartan – had little ability to activate  xxxg1807xxx  when
tested at the same concentrations, although higher concentrations of irbesartan were able to cause some activation of
the receptor [42, 46]. in these assays,  xxxd3303xxx  was a
moderately potent selective  xxxg1807xxx  agonist, activating the
receptor to 25–30% of the maximum level achieved by
conventional full agonists, such as pioglitazone and
rosiglitazone. the concentration of  xxxd3303xxx  that yielded half-maximal activation of the  xxxg1807xxx  receptor (ec50)
was approximately 4.5 µm, which is of a similar order of
magnitude to that of pioglitazone (ec 50=1.5 µm).
furthermore, the effect was specific for  xxxg1807xxx , with
 xxxd3303xxx  exhibiting no activation of  xxxg1805xxx  or  xxxg1806xxx 
when tested at concentrations achieved in plasma with
usual oral dosing for hypertension.

fold activation

at-risk hypertensive patients [25]. in losartan-treated
patients, the incidence was 13.0 per 1000 patient-years,
which was significantly lower (p<0.001) than the 17.5 per
1000 patient-years recorded among the atenolol-treated
patients. in the  xxxd3487xxx  antihypertensive long-term use
evaluation (value) study, the rate of new-onset diabetes
was found to be lower in hypertensive patients treated
with  xxxd3487xxx  than in those treated with amlodipine [26].
however, neither the life study nor the value study
involved a placebo control group, and it is unclear
whether the lower incidence of new-onset diabetes in the
patients treated with arbs represented an antidiabetic
effect of the arb or a prodiabetic effect of the comparator agent. although calcium channel blockers are not generally suspected as causing diabetes, previously published studies have shown that beta-blockers can promote
the development of type 2 diabetes in patients with
hypertension [27–30]. it should also be noted that in several placebo-controlled trials, significant antidiabetic
effects of the arb candesartan have not been consistently observed [31–34].
although some clinical trials have suggested that
arbs may be associated with a reduced incidence of newonset diabetes, the lack of consistently positive metabolic
benefits in other studies may have encouraged the belief
that all arbs are ‘metabolically neutral’ [35]. new
experimental evidence, however, suggests that all arbs
are not the same and that the arb  xxxd3303xxx  may positively influence metabolic function at a molecular level by
its ability to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma ( xxxg1807xxx ), a well-known target for insulin-sensitising antidiabetic drugs [23].

the partial agonist behaviour displayed by  xxxd3303xxx 
has potentially important consequences for treatment
(table 2). whereas conventional  xxxg1807xxx  activators
induce full activation of the receptor, selective  xxxg1807xxx 
modulators, such as  xxxd3303xxx  and the experimental
agent ntzdpa, only induce partial activation. this may
result in improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism
while causing less potential for undesirable side effects,
such as fat accumulation and weight gain. in animal
studies, selective  xxxg1807xxx  modulators have even shown
the potential to attenuate weight gain, whereas conventional  xxxg1807xxx  agonists are known to promote weight
gain [42].
 xxxd3303xxx  has also been shown to modulate selectively the expression of key  xxxg1807xxx  target genes when
tested at concentrations achievable with therapeutic oral
doses. for example, in human visceral adipocytes,  xxxd3303xxx  potently enhanced expression of the  xxxg1679xxx  target
gene that encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
( xxxg1679xxx ) [42].  xxxg1679xxx  is the enzyme responsible for
the increased glyceroneogenesis and fatty acid re-esterification that largely accounts for the ability of  xxxg1807xxx  activators to reduce fatty acid levels [42, 47]. in addition,
recent studies by fujimoto and colleagues have shown
that in 3t3l1 preadipocytes,  xxxd3303xxx , but not  xxxd3487xxx , can induce increases in glucose uptake and expression of the glut4 glucose transporter [48].
the antidiabetic actions of  xxxd3303xxx  associated with
its  xxxg1807xxx -modulating activity have been tested in rats fed
a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. after 50 days,  xxxd3303xxx  5 mg/kg reduced serum insulin concentrations and
caused a significant reduction in plasma glucose (p<0.01)
and serum triglyceride concentrations (p<0.05) compared
with losartan 5 mg/kg, and significantly attenuated weight
gain compared with either losartan 5 mg/kg or controls
(~10% less; p<0.01) [42].

gathered so far – one case study, a post-marketing surveillance study and two small-scale clinical trials – strongly
suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  treatment can be associated with
improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism.
in a case study, a 52-year-old male with metabolic syndrome was started with once-daily  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg treatment [49]. after only 8 weeks of treatment, glucose and
insulin levels fell to within normal limits. the patient was
then switched to once-daily  xxxd3487xxx  160 mg. after 6
weeks of  xxxd3487xxx , his fasting glucose and insulin levels
had risen, but returning the patient to  xxxd3303xxx  restored
his glucose and insulin levels back towards normal (fig. 2).

thereby induce receptor activation in a manner similar to
that of other partial agonists of  xxxg1807xxx  [42]. moreover,
given  xxxd3303xxx ’s very high volume of distribution,
which is much greater than that of the other arbs, it
may have a superior capacity to gain access to the
 xxxg1807xxx –rxr complex within the cell nucleus than the
other arbs [53].

with mild hypertension and type 2 diabetes [51]

this isolated case shows how  xxxd3303xxx  improved the
insulin and glucose profile in a high-risk patient with metabolic syndrome and highlights the absence of a similar
effect with  xxxd3487xxx .
a large-scale clinical study has also shown beneficial
metabolic effects of  xxxd3303xxx . specifically, in a postmarketing surveillance study of hypertensive patients
receiving once-daily  xxxd3303xxx  40–80 mg and attending
general-practice clinics in germany, 3643 patients with
overt type 2 diabetes had reduced plasma glucose
(–13.0±26.9 mg/dl) and serum triglyceride (–22.7±62.2
mg/dl) concentrations after 6 months’ treatment compared
with baseline values [50].
the metabolic effects of  xxxd3303xxx  have been further explored in two prospective, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies. in the first study, 119 patients with
mild hypertension and type 2 diabetes were randomised
to  xxxd3303xxx  40 mg/day, eprosartan 600 mg/day or
placebo [51]. after 12 months of once-daily treatment,
this relatively low dose of  xxxd3303xxx  produced a significant 25–30% (p<0.05) reduction in triglyceride concentrations compared with baseline; in contrast, neither
eprosartan nor placebo had any detectable effect on
triglyceride levels (fig. 3) [51]. in the second study,
which was a 3-month randomised, parallel-group trial
comparing  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/day with losartan 50
mg/day in 40 patients with metabolic syndrome,  xxxd3303xxx  produced significant reductions from baseline in
fasting glucose (p<0.05), insulin resistance (p<0.05) and
insulin levels (p<0.06), whereas losartan did not [52].

possible mechanism of action
the mechanism by which  xxxd3303xxx  is able to activate
 xxxg1807xxx  remains to be precisely defined. however, at
least part of the answer is likely to lie in its chemical
structure, which is quite different from that of the other
clinically approved arbs. molecular modelling reveals
that  xxxd3303xxx  is able to interact with specific amino
acid residues in the  xxxg1807xxx  ligand-binding domain and

a potential role in atherogenesis
the  xxxg1807xxx -modulating properties of  xxxd3303xxx  may
also have therapeutic implications for the prevention and
management of atherosclerosis. atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease caused by a combination of insulin
resistance, dyslipidaemia, cell inflammation, cell proliferation, hypertension and oxidative stress. there is a considerable body of evidence accumulating to show that
 xxxg1807xxx  activators can interfere with the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis [54–59].  xxxg1807xxx  activators, such as
rosiglitazone, have been shown to induce plaque regression in animal models of atherosclerosis [54, 56], reduce
progression of common carotid intima-media thickness in
patients with coronary artery disease [59] and reduce
markers of endothelial cell activation and levels of acutephase reactants in patients with coronary artery disease
and/or metabolic syndrome [57, 58].  xxxd3303xxx , by
virtue of its ability to block  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptors and to activate  xxxg1807xxx , may not only inhibit
 xxxg99xxx -mediated pathways of atherosclerosis, but
also stimulate  xxxg1807xxx  pathways that help prevent atherosclerosis. thus, further studies are warranted to explore
this potential clinical benefit.

large-scale clinical trials
the ongoing  xxxd3303xxx  alone and in combination
with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget) and
 xxxd3303xxx  randomized assessment study in aceintolerant subjects with cardiovascular disease
(transcend) are large-scale studies that have been
designed to evaluate the potential cardiovascular and
metabolic benefits of  xxxd3303xxx . these trials are investigating the effects of  xxxd3303xxx , alone and in combination with the ace inhibitor ramipril, vs. ramipril or
placebo on cardiovascular and metabolic endpoints in
high-risk patients with major vascular disease and/or
diabetes with end-organ damage [60]. on the basis of its
 xxxg99xxx -inhibiting and  xxxg1807xxx -activating properties, it is quite possible that  xxxd3303xxx  will show benefits in terms of reducing both the incidence of new-onset
diabetes and the risk of cardiovascular events.

conclusions
8.

hypertension is just one aspect of the complex matrix of
haemodynamic and metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease. the arbs as a class have been generally considered to be metabolically neutral. an exception to this
appears to be  xxxd3303xxx . data from experimental studies,
as well as accumulating clinical evidence, suggest that
 xxxd3303xxx  is unique among the arbs.  xxxd3303xxx  acts
not only as an  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor antagonist, but
also as a selective  xxxg1807xxx  modulator when tested at concentrations that may be achievable in plasma with oral
doses used for the treatment of high blood pressure.
the therapeutic benefits of  xxxg1807xxx -induced changes in
lipid and glucose metabolism are well established. initial
clinical studies show that  xxxd3303xxx  retains these properties
but unlike conventional  xxxg1807xxx  activators, which are often
accompanied by fluid retention, weight gain and oedema,
 xxxd3303xxx  acts as a selective  xxxg1807xxx  modulator without
these undesirable side effects. if the preliminary clinical trial
findings are supported by the results of ongoing large-scale
studies,  xxxd3303xxx  could have an important role to play in
the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome,
diabetes and atherosclerosis.
