abstract: the hematopoietic class iii receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk)  xxxg801xxx  ( xxxg801xxx , stk1) has
recently received much attention as a potential drug target. activation of  xxxg801xxx  by different types
of mutations plays an important role for proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and prevention of
differentiation of leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (aml). at least one type of such
mutations – an internal tandem duplication in the  xxxg801xxx  juxtamembrane domain ( xxxg801xxx -itd) - has
been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. signal transduction of  xxxg801xxx  involves activation
of several conserved pathways, including the ras/map-kinase and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/akt signaling
cascades. transforming versions of  xxxg801xxx  exhibit altered signaling, for example a very pronounced activation of  xxxg2216xxx ,
ultimately resulting in alternate profiles of gene expression and cell transformation. selective inhibitors of  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine
kinase activity have the potential to suppress aberrant  xxxg801xxx  signaling.
although highly homologous to other class iii rtks,  xxxg801xxx  is resistant to the phenylaminopyrimidine sti571 (gleevec,
imatinib), a potent inhibitor of other rtks in the family, such as the pdgfbeta-receptor or c-kit. sti571 binding to  xxxg801xxx  is
prevented by the phenylalanine 691 side-chain in the atp binding center and mutating this site to threonine renders the
corresponding  xxxg801xxx  mutant sensitive to sti571. compounds of several other structural families, including the quinoxaline
 xxxd1606xxx , the bis(1h-2-indolyl)-1-methanone d-65476, the indolinones  xxxd3191xxx  and  xxxd3264xxx , the indolocarbazoles
 xxxd2642xxx  and  xxxd2458xxx , and the piperazonyl quinazoline  xxxd3287xxx , are potent inhibitors of  xxxg801xxx  kinase. they exhibit
different selectivity profiles, both with respect to other kinases and among wildtype  xxxg801xxx  and its activated versions. these
compounds hold promise as novel drugs against aml and as probes for understanding activation mechanisms and
signaling pathways in the class iii rtk family.

key words:  xxxg801xxx , receptor  xxxg2198xxx , signal transduction, mutations, leukemia, aml, inhibitors.
introduction
the attempts to target oncogenic protein tyrosine kinases
with small molecule kinase inhibitors date back into the
1980ies. a major success was the discovery of sti571/
gleevec/imatinib. this potent inhibitor of bcr-abl and of
several class iii receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) is in
clinical use for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia
(cml) and further diseases where the target kinases play a
role [1-4]. the sti571-resistant rtk  xxxg801xxx  has recently
emerged as a novel potential drug target, since its activity is
frequently altered in acute myeloid leukemia (aml) by
overexpression, autocrine activation and by activating mutations. in this review, we describe the structure, signal
transduction mechanisms, and the biological role of  xxxg801xxx .
then, data which implicate  xxxg801xxx  in the pathogenesis of aml
are discussed as well as the types of aberrant  xxxg801xxx  activation
and their consequences for signal transduction. finally, we
review the current knowledge on kinase inhibitors for  xxxg801xxx 
and discuss future prospects of investigation.

1. structure and function of the  xxxg801xxx 
receptor  xxxg2198xxx 
1.1. structure, expression and chromosomal localization of  xxxg801xxx 
the receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk)  xxxg801xxx  (fms-like
 xxxg2198xxx  3, also designated  xxxg801xxx  or stk-1) is a
member of the class iii rtks and shares high homology
with the other members of this family, the pdgf (platelet
derived growth factor) receptors,  xxxg525xxx / xxxg524xxx  (macrophage
colony stimulating factor) receptor, and c-kit (receptor for
scf, the stem cell factor). common features of class iii rtk
include an extracellular domain consisting of five immunoglobulin like subdomains and a split kinase domain [5-8]
(fig. 1) .
the  xxxg801xxx  protein is encoded by the  xxxg801xxx  gene , which is
located on chromosome 13q12 in humans [9] and chromosome 5, region g3 in mice [10]. the human  xxxg801xxx  gene is
organized in 24 exons, of which seven encode the five iglike repeats in the extracellular domain. the exons range in
size from 83 bp to 562 bp and span approximately 100 kb in
total [11]. in mice but not in humans, a second splice variant
could be found, which lacks the fifth ig-like repeat.
nevertheless, this variant is an active kinase and also ligand
dependence is intact [12].

fig. (1). structure and signal transduction of  xxxg801xxx . the receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk)  xxxg801xxx  (fms-like  xxxg2198xxx  3, also designated
 xxxg801xxx  or stk-1) consists of an extracellular domain with five immunoglobulin like subdomains, a transmembrane domain and the
cytoplasmic domain which comprises the juxtamembrane region (jm), the  xxxg2198xxx  domain i (kdi) and ii (kdii) and the intervening
kinase insert (ki). binding of the dimeric ligand fl ( xxxg801xxx  ligand) triggers the homodimerization of two  xxxg801xxx  molecules, leading to their
activation and trans-autophosphorylation. some of the  xxxg801xxx -dependent signaling events are illustrated, including the recruitment and
activation of the src-family kinases src and fyn, tyrosine phosphorylation of shc with subsequent stimulation of the grb2/sos/ras
module and the map-kinase cascade, and activation of the  xxxg1743xxx  kinase/akt pathway via gab1/2. downstream events are the stimulation of
proliferation and an anti-apoptotic effect. ubiquitination of  xxxg801xxx  and the signaling mediators p85 and shc under participation of the e3
ubiquitin ligase cbl/cblb is one possibility for negative regulation of  xxxg801xxx  among others. for further details, see text.

the predicted molecular mass of the nascent  xxxg801xxx  protein
is 110 kda. as a consequence of posttranslational glycosylation, two entities with apparent molecular masses of 130 and
150 kda are formed. the extracellular domain of the  xxxg801xxx 
protein contains nine sites that could potentially serve for the
attachment of n-linked carbohydrates. indeed, treatment
with different glycosidases showed that  xxxg801xxx  contains nlinked, but not o-linked sugars. only the 130 kda form was
sensitive to endo h treatment, suggesting that this form
represents an intermediate form containing high-mannose nlinked sugars [13, 14].

nucleus, in the preoptic area [15] and also in the retina [16].
the best characterized tissue concerning  xxxg801xxx  expression
remains the bone marrow. there,  xxxg801xxx  is expressed in early
multipotent progenitor cells, but not in primitive stem cells.
lin-sca1+c-kit+ xxxg801xxx + cells efficiently reconstitute b and t
lymphopoiesis, but display defects in myeloid repopulation
[17]. thus, acquisition of  xxxg801xxx  expression seems to be accompanied by a loss of self-renewal capacity in the hematopoietic
stem cell compartment.  xxxg801xxx  expression remains detectable
during monocytic differentiation, whereas the expression is
lost during b-lymphoid and granulocytic maturation [17-20].

although  xxxg801xxx  was initially cloned from fetal liver
hematopoietic cells [7], its expression is not restricted to this
tissue. expression of  xxxg801xxx  protein could be detected in
placenta, brain, cerebellum, testis, lymph nodes, thymus, and
in the liver of 6- to 8-week-old mice [14]. more detailed
investigations in neuronal tissues revealed highest expression
in purkinje neurons of the cerebellum and, to a lesser extent,
in granule neurons of the hippocampus, the anterior olfactory

only few data are available on the transcriptional regulation of  xxxg801xxx  expression.  xxxg1996xxx  -/- mice, which lack the myelogenous transcription factor  xxxg1996xxx , do not express  xxxg801xxx . this
is consistent with the presence of a potential  xxxg1996xxx  binding
site 109-114 nt upstream of the transcriptional start site [11].
it has also been shown that treatment with il-6 reduces,
whereas  xxxg2269xxx  increases expression of  xxxg801xxx  [21]. given the
importance of  xxxg801xxx  expression in several pathological

 xxxg801xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  as a drug target in leukemia

conditions (see below), a better understanding of its
expression regulation seems very desirable.
1.2. the function of  xxxg801xxx  for normal hematopoiesis
the above described expression pattern of  xxxg801xxx  (1.1.)
suggests important functions of this kinase in hematopoiesis.
this notion is supported by the analysis of mice with an
inactivated  xxxg801xxx  gene. however, the observed phenotypes
are rather mild [22].  xxxg801xxx  -/- mice developed normally, were
fertile and appeared healthy. peripheral blood smears and
differential blood counts showed no morphological or
quantitative abnormalities. however, a more detailed analysis
of the bone marrow revealed decreased levels of  xxxg1897xxx +
cd43+ pro-b cells, whereas the amount of pre-b cells,
erythroid, and myeloid progenitors was normal. the amount
of primitive b lymphoid progenitors was 10-fold reduced as
revealed by long-term cultures. competitive repopulation
experiments, in which wild-type and  xxxg801xxx  -/- bone marrow
were mixed and transplanted to lethally irradiated mice
revealed that both myeloid and b lymphoid precursors from
 xxxg801xxx  -/- bone marrow had a two- to fourfold repopulation
disadvantage compared to wildtype precursors. thymic t
cells and splenic b cells of the recipient were derived almost
completely from wild-type competitor cells. these experiments demonstrated an important function of  xxxg801xxx  in the
generation of myeloid and lymphoid cells. the fact that mice
can largely compensate the loss of  xxxg801xxx  is encouraging for
strategies where  xxxg801xxx  is used as a drug target. toxic effects
resulting from inhibition of normal  xxxg801xxx  functions can be
expected to be limited.
1.3. expression and structure of the  xxxg801xxx  ligand fl
the gene encoding the  xxxg801xxx  ligand fl - flt3l - is located
on chromosome 19q13.3 in humans, and on chromosome 7
in mice. the human flt3l gene comprises 8 exons and
encodes a 235-amino acid type i transmembrane protein. it
consists of an n-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, a 156residue extracellular domain, a 23-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 30-residue cytoplasmic domain. soluble
fl, a 20 kda protein, can be generated either by an alternative splicing of exon 6, or it can be released by proteolysis
from the membrane-bound fl [23, 24]. soluble fl has a
short chain four-helical bundle structure that is stabilized by
three intramolecular disulfide bonds. it forms non-covalent
homodimers, where the residues 25-30 and 63-68 of one
monomer constitute a large hydrophobic area that interdigitates with the equivalent segments of the other monomer.
nine amino acid residues are indispensable for receptor binding and biological activity. they cluster around the poles of
the fl dimer approximately 45 å apart. in membrane-bound
fl, they are facing away from the plasma membrane consistent with the finding that this form of fl is also bioactive.
despite the fact that pdgf dimers are built up of a cystineknot structure, fl and pdgf display the same overall dimensions (approximately 70 å x 35 å x 25 å). it is therefore
likely that fl, as pdgf, binds to the second and third ig-like
subdomain in the extracellular part of  xxxg801xxx  [24] (fig. 1).
northern blot analyses revealed ubiquitous expression of
fl in murine tissues, except in the brain. the highest levels
of fl mrna could be detected in peripheral leukocytes
[25]. human bone marrow stromal cells produce mrnas for

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 16 1869

both the transmembrane and the soluble forms of fl [26].
the expression of fl is increased in the liver and spleen of
mice, which are double transgenic for il-6 and the soluble  xxxg1181xxx  receptor [27].
1.4. when fl is missing...
targeted disruption of the flt3l gene in mice led to a
more severe phenotype than disruption of the  xxxg801xxx  gene
[28]. flt3l -/- mice bred normally and displayed no overt
phenotype. however, peripheral white blood cell numbers
were reduced by 45% with predominant reduction in
lymphocytes.
detailed analyses of the bone marrow revealed a 27%
reduction in total cell number that resulted from a decrease
in  xxxg1897xxx +igm- immature b lymphocytes and a decrease in
 xxxg1206xxx +gr-1+ immature myeloid cells. colony forming
assays of flt3l -/- bone marrow revealed a remarkable
decrease in b-lymphoid precursors (b-cfu). single cell
suspensions from whole spleens and lymph nodes revealed a
reduced cellularity of both organs in flt3l -/- mice as
compared to the wildtype. analysis by flow cytometry
showed a reduction in total numbers of both t and b
lymphocytes but the ratio between b and t cells was normal.
although b lymphopoiesis is impaired in flt3l -/- mice,
peripheral b lymphocytes appear to function normally.
in lymphoid tissues, both myeloid related ( xxxg1208xxx +
cd8a-) as well as lymphoid related ( xxxg1208xxx +cd8a+) dendritic
cells (dc) were reduced dramatically. nevertheless, dc
purified from flt3l -/- spleen were able to stimulate allogeneic t-cell proliferation. the number of natural killer cells
(nk1.1high, cd3 - nk cells) in the spleen was reduced 5-fold
but nk cell functions remained intact.
it is currently not known why loss of fl is more severe
than loss of  xxxg801xxx . there are no hints for another receptor of
fl, except  xxxg801xxx . it is possible that the differences between
 xxxg801xxx  -/- and flt3l -/- phenotypes are related to the different genetic backgrounds that were used for the analyses.
1.5. early signals emitted by  xxxg801xxx 
generally,  xxxg801xxx  signal transduction (fig. 1) is hitherto
less well characterized than signal transduction of other class
iii family members. ligand binding induces a rapid onset of
 xxxg801xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation, which peaks at five minutes
and declines after 15 min. tyrosine phosphorylation is – by
analogy to other class iii rtks – due to trans-autophosphorylation of two receptor subunits. in addition, other tyrosine
kinases may contribute to  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation (see
below). numerous signaling molecules have been proposed
to be involved in  xxxg801xxx  signal transduction. activation of the
receptor involves the recruitment and activation of the src
family kinases src and fyn, which may participate in the
phosphorylation of the receptor and of downstream signaling
molecules [29]. sequence comparison between human  xxxg801xxx 
and the pdgfbeta−receptor reveals a high degree of sequence
homology in the juxtamembrane region suggesting a potential src and  xxxg2216xxx  binding site at  xxxg801xxx  y589/591. indeed,
activation of  xxxg801xxx  induces the specific phosphorylation of
stat5a, but not of  xxxg2216xxx  [30]. very recently, murata et
al. [31] could show that one of both y589 or 591 is necessary for the activation of stat5a. earlier, it has been

1870

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 16

observed that truncation of the  xxxg801xxx  c-terminus leads to a
decrease of the stat5a phosphorylation suggesting that this
region of the receptor participates at least partially in
stat5a activation [30]. compared to transforming variants
of  xxxg801xxx  (see below), activation of stat5a by wildtype  xxxg801xxx  is
relatively weak and transient. the biological importance of
stat5a activation for normal  xxxg801xxx  function remains to be
clarified.
one of the major phosphorylated  xxxg801xxx  substrates is the
adaptor protein shc [32]. fl-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of shc involves the grb2 binding sites y239, y240,
and y313. indeed, fl-dependent recruitment of grb2 to
shc has been shown, suggesting that shc phosphorylation
is likely to couple  xxxg801xxx  activation to the ras/map-kinase
pathway. interestingly, fl-induced phosphorylation of shc
is independent of the functional shc ptb or sh2 domain.
also, it does not require phosphorylation of murine  xxxg801xxx  at
y769, 985, or 972. these observations suggest that flinduced shc phosphorylation does not depend on an
association of shc to  xxxg801xxx , but that it may only require its
recruitment to the membrane via phospholipids. in addition
to grb2,  xxxg801xxx  activation causes association of the phosphatidylinositol phosphatase ship to phosphorylated shc via a
mechanism that requires the intact shc ptb domain [32].
 xxxg801xxx  can also activate the ras/map-kinase path-way via
direct interaction with grb2. the phosphotyrosines 769 and
958 of murine  xxxg801xxx  have been implicated in the grb2
association [29, 32].
the phospholipase c isoform plcgamma that couples receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  receptors to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositole-4,5 bisphosphate is recruited to  xxxg801xxx  via its two
sh2 domains. it is very transiently phosphorylated between
30 seconds to 1 minute after  xxxg801xxx  activation.
the sh2 domain-containing protein vav-1 is exclusively
expressed in hematopoietic cells. vav-1 has been shown to
function as a gtp exchange factor for the small gtpases
rac and cdc42 that are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements [33]. although vav-1 has not been shown to associate
with  xxxg801xxx , activation of the receptor leads to an increase of its
phosphorylation within 30 seconds to 5 minutes after ligand
stimulation [29, 34]
upon growth factor receptor-mediated activation, class
ia phosphoinositide-3 kinases (pi3k) catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the d3 position in the
inositol ring. the products of this reaction induce a plethora
of cellular events including anti-apoptosis, mitogenesis, and
receptor internalization. the enzymes of this class consist of
regulatory p85 subunits that contain sh2 domains, and of
catalytic p110 subunits. recruitment of pi3ks to activated
rtks leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 and activation of the catalytic p110 subunit. after ligand stimulation of
murine  xxxg801xxx , p85 gets phosphorylated and binds to y958 in
the c-terminus within a p85 binding consensus site (yqnm)
[34]. experiments with y958f mutants showed, however,
that  xxxg801xxx -induced pi3kinase activity is not necessary for
mitogenesis of ba/f3 cells, or for receptor internalization
[35]. in contrast, human  xxxg801xxx  lacks this c-terminal binding
site and seems not capable to directly associate with p85.
despite the lack of direct binding, activation of human  xxxg801xxx 
also leads to rapid phosphorylation of p85 [29]. recent
studies revealed that activation of human  xxxg801xxx  induces the

schmidt-arras et al.

binding of the p85 subunit to the adaptor proteins gab1 and
gab2 [36-38]. the gab (grb2 associated binder)-family
proteins share an overall domain structure: it involves an nterminal pleckstrin homology (ph) domain, which is
responsible for their targeting to the plasmamembrane, and a
 xxxd1075xxx -interaction domain also designated as c-met
binding domain (mbd). further domains include a prolinerich region, and several well conserved sh2-domain binding
sites, including sites for the association with grb2, p85, the
adaptor molecules crk and crkl, and the protein-tyrosine
phosphatase (ptp)  xxxg1894xxx  [39]. both gab1 and gab2 transduce a signal to the ras/map-kinase pathway but seem to
differ in other aspects of their downstream signaling [40]. in
the case of  xxxg801xxx , both gab1 and gab2 are transiently phosphorylated in a ligand dependent manner, and show an inducible association with p85 and  xxxg1894xxx . also a constitutive
association with grb2 was detected which is likely to be
mediated through the grb2 sh3 domain. a direct association
of gab1 or gab2 with  xxxg801xxx  could, however, not be demonstrated [36-38].
 xxxg801xxx  phosphorylates the 100 kda proteins cbl and
cblb, which have recently been identified as e3 ubiquitin
ligases that are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation as well as in the internalization of the pdgfr,
m- xxxg525xxx , and egfr [41-43], and also of pi3kinases [44].
although cbl can mediate poly-ubiquitination, a very recent
report shows that the rtks pdgfr and egfr are monoubiquitinated on multiple sites in a cbl-dependent manner.
the mono-ubiquitination is necessary for their internalization and for lysosomal degradation [45]. similarly, cbl and
cblb may regulate  xxxg801xxx  through lysosomal or proteasomal
degradation, but so far this has not been investigated. activation of  xxxg801xxx  induces also the  xxxd1075xxx -dependent
association of cbl and cblb with p85 and shc, which
may affect the stability of these signaling molecules. finally,
cbl and cblb have been proposed to regulate the ras pathway by competing with sos for binding to grb2 [46, 47].
another regulator of  xxxg801xxx  signaling may be the 120 kda
protein gap. gap stimulates the gtpase activity of ras. in
murine b-lymphoid ba/f3 cells, p120gap is tyrosine phosphorylated already 30 seconds after  xxxg801xxx  activation and
phosphorylation is detectable until 10 minutes. gap does
not seem to associate with  xxxg801xxx  directly [29], although the nterminal sh2 domain of p120gap showed interaction with
 xxxg801xxx  in pulldown assays [34].
in general, rtk signaling is also modulated and negatively regulated by ptps [48]. almost nothing is known yet,
however, about ptps in the negative regulation of  xxxg801xxx .
according to our own data, ligand-activated  xxxg801xxx  is rapidly
dephosphorylated in different cellular backgrounds. the ptp
 xxxg1895xxx  has the capacity for negative regulation of signaling,
but the biological relevance of this interaction remains to be
established (schmidt-arras et al., unpublished data).
1.6. fl induced gene expression
suppression of apoptosis seems to be a major biological
effect of  xxxg801xxx  activation. several lines of evidence suggest
that  xxxg801xxx  exerts an anti-apoptotic action by modulating the
expression of regulators of apoptosis. for example, using
aml blasts, lisovsky et al. showed a reduction of apoptotic
cells when cultures were maintained for 3 days in the

 xxxg801xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  as a drug target in leukemia

presence of fl. analysis of the non-apoptotic cells displayed
a lower expression level of the pro-apoptotic protein bax,
whereas the protein level of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 was not
affected by fl [49]. a part of the anti-apoptotic regulation of
gene expression is likely to be mediated by  xxxg801xxx -dependent
activation of pi3k and subsequently pkb/akt. forkhead
transcription factors (recently termed foxos) are known
downstream targets of pkb/akt and their phosphorylation
leads to retention in the cytoplasm and subsequent inactivation (fig. 1). thereby, the pro-apoptotic transcriptional activity of foxos is prevented [50, 51]. indeed, a constitutively
active  xxxg801xxx  mutant ( xxxg801xxx -itd, see 2.2.) has recently been
linked to the phosphorylation of foxo-1 and foxo-3a by
pkb/akt (b. scheijen et al., personal communication)1.
in a very recent publication [52], several  xxxg250xxx -familyassociated antiapoptotic pathways have been described that
originate from  xxxg801xxx  receptors. interestingly, differences
between wildtype and constitutively active oncogenic forms
of the receptor (see below) seem to exist.  xxxg801xxx -wildtype
induced phosphorylation of the proapoptotic  xxxg250xxx  family
member bad at two sites, one (ser-112) mediated by mapkdependent pathways, the other (ser-136) by pi3k/akt. these
phosphorylating events have been shown to inhibit bad
function. activation of wildtype  xxxg801xxx  did not induce expression changes in other  xxxg250xxx  family members. in contrast, an
oncogenic  xxxg801xxx  isoform induced the stat target gene bclxl, an antiapoptotic member of the  xxxg250xxx  family. in a series
of experiments from our own laboratories including microarray gene expression analyses, we also saw profound differences in expression profiles induced by ligand-activated
wildtype receptors and the oncogenic  xxxg801xxx  isoforms [53].
these differences will be discussed below (see 2.4).
the beta-1 integrins play a central role in the adhesive
interactions between hematopoietic progenitors/stem cells
and the bone marrow stromal cells. both alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1
integrins are expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells. a
recent study showed that fl can induce the expression of the
beta-1 integrins  xxxg1203xxx  and  xxxg1204xxx  and therefore might
influence the homing and retention of progenitor cells in the
bone marrow [54].
by yeast two-hybrid screening the  xxxg801xxx  interacting zinc
finger protein (fiz) has been identified [55]. fiz is a 60 kda
protein containing 11 c2h2 zinc fingers and is ubiquitously
expre-ssed. fiz localizes to the nucleus as well as to the
cytoplasm and associates with  xxxg801xxx  in an fl-dependent
manner. recently the retinal bzip transcription factor nrl
has been shown to interact with fiz [16]. both proteins, fiz
and  xxxg801xxx , could be detected in murine retina and overexpression of fiz reduced the nrl-dependent transactivation of a
rhodopsin promoter construct. these data suggest a role of
fiz as a transcriptional repressor which is under control of
 xxxg801xxx .
2. role of  xxxg801xxx  in leukemia
2.1.  xxxg801xxx  expression in hematopoietic malignancies
as described above,  xxxg801xxx  is expressed in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells during a restricted period of early
maturation. here it mediates important signals for cell growth,
proliferation, survival, and migration. expression analyses in
hematologic malignancies revealed  xxxg801xxx  expression in acute

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 16 1871

leukemias of myeloid and b-precursor lineages. acute
myeloid leukemia (aml) is characterized by the infiltration
of the bone marrow with highly proliferative cells - leukemic
blasts - that arrest at different stages of myeloid differentiation. aml cases are traditionally classified according to their
morphological appearance in relation to normal hematopoietic progenitors, using a classification system developed
by a french-american-british group (the fab classification).
although  xxxg801xxx  expression is absent in the normal counterparts of most of the aml blast types, its expression in a
high proportion of blasts has been detected in 62 to 92% of
aml cases. several types of other hematologic malignancies
have been analyzed for the expression of  xxxg801xxx , and it is
expressed in most cases of b-precursor acute lymphocytic
leukemia's (all), whereas it is much less abundant in tall. furthermore,  xxxg801xxx  expression was found in lymphoid
and myeloid blast crises of cml and in some cases with
myelodysplastic syndrome [56-60]. fl has been shown to
induce  xxxg801xxx  autophosphorylation and to promote proliferation
and survival of  xxxg801xxx -positive leukemic blasts in vitro , either
alone or in combination with g-csf, gm-csf, interleukin3, and scf, the ligand for kit [49, 57, 58, 61]. these findings
suggest a relevant role of  xxxg801xxx  in mediating proliferation and
survival of leukemic blasts. also, many leukemia cell lines
of the myeloid and b-lymphoid lineages have been shown to
express functional  xxxg801xxx  receptors and to respond to fl by
enhanced proliferation and survival. interestingly, a remarkable portion of  xxxg801xxx -positive cell lines also produce fl,
suggesting a possible autocrine stimulatory loop of  xxxg801xxx  in
aml [60, 62, 63]. the existence of an autocrine activation
of proliferation in such cell lines is also indicated by growth
inhibition with selective  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors (see below).
2.2. activating  xxxg801xxx  mutations in leukemia
in 1996, nakao and coworkers first noted mutations of
 xxxg801xxx  in bone marrow samples from aml patients. in 5 of 30
patients, they described the occurrence of in-frame insertions
of several nucleotides in the mrna sequence encoding the
juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. in all patients,
wildtype  xxxg801xxx  was coexpressed with the mutated form [64].
sequencing of the mutant alleles of this and further patient
sample series revealed internal tandem duplications (itd) of
varying length, resulting in the repetition of a stretch from 4
to up to 50 amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the
receptor (fig. 2, table 1). the mechanism of how these
mutations arise has not been extensively studied. however,
in one paper it is discussed that the palindromic sequence of
the  xxxg801xxx  gene corresponding to the codons for  xxxd593xxx  to
k602 might, together with an impaired dna repair mechanism, contribute to the generation of the  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations
[65]. meanwhile, several groups published data on the prevalence of  xxxg801xxx -itd in large cohorts of aml patients, which
varies between 13.2 and 34% [66-78]. in total, 963 cases
with presence of  xxxg801xxx -itd have been found in a population
of 4173, indicating a prevalence of 23.1%. the frequency of
the mutations according to fab subgroups of aml differs
considerably, with less abundance in the fab m2 (with
signs of myeloid differentiation) and m6 (with erythroid
differentiation characteristics) subtypes [67, 69, 71, 72, 79]
and a relatively high frequency in the fab m3 subtype, the

fig. (2). different types of activating  xxxg801xxx  mutations in aml.  xxxg801xxx  is physiologically activated by binding of its ligand fl to the wildtype
receptor ( xxxg801xxx -wt). mutations in two hot spots of the  xxxg801xxx  gene lead to autoactivation of the receptor: first, internal tandem duplications in
the juxtamembrane region of the receptor ( xxxg801xxx -itd) leading to in-frame–insertions of a stretch of amino acids that differs from patient to
patient. second, mutations in the activation loop of  xxxg801xxx , which is located in the second kinase domain. point mutations, deletions or small
insertions are found at asp835 or closely downstream. abbreviationsare explained in the legend to fig. (1).

t(15;17) translocation [71, 74, 80]. cytogenetic analyses
revealed the highest prevalence of  xxxg801xxx -itd in cases with
normal karyotype.  xxxg801xxx  mutations occur rarely together with
t(8;21) aberrations [71, 72].
the prognostic significance of  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations has
been controversially discussed during the last years. in the
majority of studies, the detection of  xxxg801xxx -itd was associated
with an unfavorable prognosis of the patients, with reduced
disease free and overall survival due to an increased relapse
rate [66, 69-75]. in most cases, both the itd-mutated alleles
and the wildtype allele are transcribed so that both wildtype
and mutated  xxxg801xxx  are coexpressed in aml blasts. there is
growing evidence that reduction or loss of expression of the
wildtype mrna is of prognostic impact and that patients
who lost expression from the wildtype allele have a critical
prognosis [72, 73, 75]. especially in fab m3 subtypes of
aml,  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations are also associated with high
white blood counts, a high percentage of bone marrow blasts

and high levels of ldh at diagnosis [69, 70, 73, 80], all
associated with increased risks for treatment failure.
in pediatric patients with aml,  xxxg801xxx -itd seems to be
less abundant (5.3% to 24.5%) compared to adult aml [8185]. two research groups found that patients below the age
of 10 very rarely have  xxxg801xxx -itd-positive aml, whereas they
did not find any difference in the prevalence in the age group
10-18 [82, 86]. in children, the expression of  xxxg801xxx -itd
clearly indicates a relatively bad prognosis.
on the other hand, in the large group of aml patients
above 60 years, itd mutations are relatively frequent and no
clear association between  xxxg801xxx -itd and a bad prognosis was
found [76]. current treatment of aml is most successful in
young patients, and aml in the elderly is associated with a
relatively bad prognosis, due to reasons of co-morbidity, but
also because in this age group other bad biological indicators
like complex karyotypes are more frequent than in younger

nate a restriction site, is lower than the prevalence of flt3itd: 7% in aml, 3% in mds, and 3% in all [79, 99]. so
far, only in one study a correlation of activating loop mutations with leucocytosis at diagnosis and worse prognosis was
found [70]. besides single amino acid substitutions, several
other mutations in the activating loop have been described,
including substitutions associated with single amino acid
insertions, or larger insertions in the vicinity of  xxxd835xxx  (table
1) [100-102].
taken together,  xxxg801xxx  mutations represent the most frequent molecular aberration known to occur in aml. several
types of mutations have been shown to cause activation and
aberrant signal transduction of the receptor. the evidence
that these mutations have a role in aml pathophysiology is
overwhelming and it seems very promising to target the
receptor in cases with  xxxg801xxx  mutations.

patients. these factors might mask the biologic effects of
 xxxg801xxx -itd.
 xxxg801xxx -itd mutations have also been found in myelodysplastic syndromes, even though the frequency is very low
[67, 87, 88]. in longitudinal studies, it was found that the
appearance of itd mutations in myelodysplastic bone
marrow may indicate its leukemic transformation [88].
 xxxg801xxx -itd mutations are not very stable during the
evolution of aml. between first diagnosis and relapse new
itd mutations were observed in the same patient. in some
cases,  xxxg801xxx -itd mutations were absent in relapse, although
they had been present at the initial presentation of the aml
[89-92]. thus, the use of  xxxg801xxx  mutations to monitor minimal
residual disease after therapy might be limited.
the transforming ability of  xxxg801xxx -itd in myeloid cells has
also been examined in mouse models. injection of  xxxg801xxx -itdtransfected 32d cells into a syngeneic mouse strain caused a
fatal disease in the recipient animals, with infiltration of the
bone marrow, liver, spleen and other organs by the injected
cell line [93]. autoactivation of  xxxg801xxx  by fusion to tel (flt3tel) caused the same phenotype [94]. in a primary murine
bone marrow transplant model,  xxxg801xxx -itd induced a myeloproliferative disease, but no aml [95]. the same model in
pml/raralpha transgenic mice caused manifest apl, suggesting a cooperation between both mutations in transformation
of myeloid cells to aml blasts [96].
more recently, a series of other  xxxg801xxx  mutations has been
found in aml (fig. 2, table 1). most of these mutations are
point mutations in the activation loop. this structure has
repressive functions in several rtks, including other
members of the rtk iii family [97, 98]. the most frequent
target of these mutations is the  xxxd233xxx  at position 835
( xxxd835xxx ). substitutions by tyrosine, valine, histidine, glutamic
acid, and asparagine have been described, with tyrosine
being most frequent. the prevalence of point mutations at
this site, which are relatively easy to detect since they elimi-

whether overexpression of wildtype  xxxg801xxx  has any role in
leukemic transformation is a matter of debate. of note, it has
been shown recently in a microarray analysis of childhood
acute leukemias that cases with translocations involving the
mll gene express very high levels of  xxxg801xxx  mrna [103]. in
a second paper the authors demonstrated that a mll-positive
cell line displayed an amplification of the  xxxg801xxx  gene locus
resulting in high  xxxg801xxx  protein expression and constitutive
autophosphorylation of the receptor [102]. the cells were
sensitive to growth inhibition in vitro and in a xenograft
model to a  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor targeting  xxxg801xxx  ( xxxd2642xxx ,
see 3.3.). this paper argues in favor of the hypothesis that
overexpression of wildtype  xxxg801xxx  might contribute to leukemic
transformation. on the other hand, data cited below that
describe qualitative differences in the nature of the signals by
wildtype or mutated receptors argue against a role of  xxxg801xxx 
wildtype overexpression in the development of aml. also,
clinical data implicate a bad prognosis to be associated with
itd positivity that might even be alleviated by  xxxg801xxx  wildtype
coexpression (see above). definitive answers to the question
of the importance of wildtype  xxxg801xxx  in the initiation or
maintenance of human leukemias will come from clinical
trials with  xxxg801xxx -specific  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors. since the
question is open, these trials should not be exclusively
performed in cases with proven  xxxg801xxx  mutations.
2.3. mechanism of  xxxg801xxx  activation by mutations
studies about the mechanisms that activate  xxxg801xxx  as a
consequence of the different classes of mutations are sparse.
kiyoi et al. have shown that a short protein consisting of the
extracellular, transmembrane and itd-mutated juxtamembrane domains of  xxxg801xxx  forms heterocomplexes with coexpressed wildtype  xxxg801xxx  [104]. this is not observed, if the
wildtype juxtamembrane domain is used instead. the heterocomplexes induce constitutive autophosphorylation of the
receptor as well as activation of downstream signaling cascades and cytokine-independent growth in ba/f3 cells. in the
same paper, earlier results from the study of kit mutations
were recapitulated showing that insertions as well as deletions in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor induce
ligand-independent receptor activation [104-106].
these reports indicate that activation of  xxxg801xxx  by the itd
mutations occurs through the loss of a repressive function of
the  xxxg801xxx  juxtamembrane domain for  xxxg801xxx  activation2. the
analogy to other kinases of the same family suggests that this

1874

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 16

hypothesis might indeed be true. for example, studying kit
activation, the rottapel laboratory has recently shown that a
peptide corresponding to the kit juxtamembrane domain
forms a secondary structure that binds to the kit catalytic
domain. this structure is interrupted, if known activating
mutations of kit are incorporated into the peptide or if it is
phosphorylated on tyrosines [107]. strong evidence for a
repressive function of the juxtamembrane region comes also
from crystallographic studies of another rtk. the juxtamembrane region of  xxxg713xxx  inhibits enzymatic activity by
binding to the kinase domain and preventing it from assuming an active conformation. phosphorylation of juxtamembrane tyrosines relieves this intramolecular repression [108].
the other known mutations in aml cluster in the socalled activation loop, another regulatory structure in
tyrosine kinases. in an unphosphorylated state, the activation
loop inhibits kinase activity. phosphorylation of a tyrosine
residue within this loop, as it occurs early after ligand
binding, leads to changes in the structure of the activation
loop and in turn relieves the repression of enzyme activity.
point mutations in residues, which stabilize the activation
loop structure in the inactive state, have a similar effect as
phosphorylation. activation loop mutations have been reported to cause constitutive activation of a number of tyrosine
kinases (for reviews see [97, 109]). experiments with  xxxg801xxx 
kinase inhibitors (see 3.3.) suggest that different  xxxg801xxx 
mutations may in fact result in somewhat different structures
of the kinase active site. the detailed understanding of the
activation mechanisms by mutations will require the
availability of  xxxg801xxx  crystal structures.
2.4. aberrant signal transduction by  xxxg801xxx  mutations
in recent years, several groups have studied the signal
transduction and biological consequences of activating  xxxg801xxx 
mutations. kiyoi and colleagues showed ligand-independent
 xxxg801xxx  autophosphorylation upon transfection of  xxxg801xxx -itd in
cos7 cells [65]. hematopoietic progenitor cell lines of
myeloid (32d) or lymphoid (ba/f3) origin, stably transfected with mutated  xxxg801xxx , were used to characterize the cell
biological consequences of  xxxg801xxx  mutant expression and activity. expression of  xxxg801xxx -itd or of the  xxxg801xxx  activation loop
mutations induces these cells to proliferate factor-independently, and to display radiation resistance and clonogenic
growth in  xxxd2609xxx . furthermore, constitutive activation of the  xxxg2216xxx , ras/map-kinase, and pi3k/akt pathways has been observed [93, 94, 110, 111]. in these studies,
profound differences were found between signaling properties of ligand-activated wildtype receptors and mutationally
activated  xxxg801xxx -itd. for example, activation of stat5a is
only rather weak by ligand-activated wildtype  xxxg801xxx , whereas
 xxxg801xxx -itd activates stat5a strongly and constitutively.
furthermore, clonal growth of 32d cells in  xxxd2609xxx 
could only be achieved by  xxxg801xxx -itd but not by the ligandstimulated wildtype receptor [93]. in line with these observations is the recent report about signaling differences
between  xxxg801xxx  wildtype and  xxxg801xxx -itd towards apoptosis
prevention mentioned earlier (1.6) [52]. these findings
suggest, that  xxxg801xxx -itd can activate additional aberrant
signaling pathways, possibly by alterations of the substrate
specificity or the autophosphorylation pattern of the receptor.
we recently compared gene expression profiles of 32d cells

schmidt-arras et al.

transfected either with ligand-activated wildtype  xxxg801xxx  or flt3itd by a microarray analysis [53]. we found profound
differences, including a strong induction of stat target
genes and suppression of myeloid transcription factors like
c/ebpalpha or pu.1 by  xxxg801xxx -itd but not  xxxg801xxx  wildtype. the
latter findings revealed not only aberrant proliferative and
survival signals by  xxxg801xxx -itd, but also implicated a negative
influence of  xxxg801xxx -itd on myeloid differentiation. an
equivalent obser-vation has recently been made by another
group, showing a block of differentiation of 32d cells by
 xxxg801xxx -itd that could be overcome by treatment with a
selective  xxxg801xxx  kinase inhibitor [112]. constitutive  xxxg801xxx 
phosphorylation, aberrant stat activation as well as
autonomous proliferation after transfection into  xxxg1177xxx 
dependent cell lines has also been shown for mutations of the
activating loop of  xxxg801xxx  [100, 101].
it will be interesting to see further analyses of the
structure-function relationships of the different  xxxg801xxx  domains
that play a role in its mutational activation. elucidating these
mechanisms might enable us to more efficiently and specifically interfere with this pathological process. furthermore,
the different mutations seem to elicit different signals and
thus may influence the pathophysiological process of aml
in different ways. studies on the effects of different mutations on  xxxg801xxx  localization and its substrate specificity as well
as on the function of hematopoietic progenitor cells are
under way that will give us more understanding about the
molecular basis of their dramatic biological effects.
3. inhibitors of  xxxg801xxx  kinase activity
3.1. the potential of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
since the discovery of oncogenic tyrosine kinases, the
possible use of selective inhibitors for cancer therapy has
been explored [113, 114]. the pioneering discoveries of
naturally occurring kinase inhibitors such as erbstatin [115]
or genistein [116], and of the synthetic ‘tyrphostins’ [117]
with remarkable selectivity for different kinase families
[113] was followed by large drug discovery programmes in
the pharmaceutical industry. they led to selective inhibitors,
often with efficacy in the nanomolar range, holding great
promise for therapy. it took, however, until 2001 that with
sti571 ( xxxd2332xxx , gleevec, imatinib) the first tyrosine
kinase inhibitor obtained approval for clinical use [2, 3]. the
phenylaminopyrimidine sti571 potently inhibits kinase
activity of bcr-abl, the oncogenic  xxxg2198xxx  which
drives proliferation of tumor cells in chronic myeloid
leukemia [118]. in addition, it inhibits the class iii receptor
tyrosine kinases pdgfalpha- and beta-receptor, c-kit [119], c-abl,
and the abl-related  xxxg2198xxx  arg [120]. it is readily
orally available and exhibits little toxicity at therapeutically
effective doses. although it is too early to evaluate the effect
of sti571 on the long term clinical outcome of cml, it
dramatically improves life quality and duration of the
asymptomatic state of cml patients, and it is currently
widely used. the success of sti571 greatly stimulated the
search for  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors with other applications.
the emerging role of  xxxg801xxx  and of constitutively active
 xxxg801xxx  mutants in aml strongly suggested that  xxxg801xxx  kinase
inhibitors might present novel therapeutic agents for this
disease [121]. the first study on the use of a  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine
kinase inhibitor came from the laboratory of naoe [122]. the

 xxxg801xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  as a drug target in leukemia

authors demonstrated that  xxxd2271xxx , a natural compound from streptomyces sp. which was originally discovered as an inhibitor of src kinase [123], also inhibits  xxxg801xxx 
and can reduce growth of  xxxg801xxx -itd transfected cells in vitro
and in vivo [122]. the same laboratory later demonstrated
that the effect of  xxxd2271xxx  occurs largely by inhibiting
the interaction of  xxxg801xxx -itd with hsp90. in turn, degradation
of  xxxg801xxx -itd is triggered [124]. wildtype  xxxg801xxx  is apparently
more stable in the absence of hsp90 and therefore not
affected by  xxxd2271xxx  [124]. efficacy of a direct tyrosine
kinase inhibitor against  xxxg801xxx  was first shown by the laboratory of small in 2001 [125, 126]. these authors tested the
quinoxaline tyrphostine  xxxd1606xxx  (fig. 3a), a compound
previously established as rather selective inhibitor of
pdgfalpha- and beta-receptor and c-kit [127-129].  xxxd1606xxx 
inhibited the activity of both,  xxxg801xxx  wildtype and  xxxg801xxx -itd
with an ic50 of about 0.3 µm. it blocked  xxxg801xxx -dependent
growth of ba/f3 cells and, importantly, suppressed the
growth of leukemic blasts from aml patients [126]. while
 xxxd1606xxx  because of its relatively low potency and its
pharmacokinetic properties is not a candidate for further
development, these first studies clearly showed the potential
of  xxxg228xxx  inhibition for the treatment of aml.
3.2. mechanism of  xxxg801xxx  resistance to sti571/gleevec
since  xxxd1606xxx  besides inhibiting  xxxg801xxx  was originally
found as a pdgf receptor kinase inhibitor [127], the obvious
question arises whether other known pdgf receptor kinase
inhibitors may have efficacy for  xxxg801xxx . most interesting
would, of course, be sti571 since it is already in clinical
use. unfortunately, sti571 does not inhibit  xxxg801xxx  [119]. in
collaboration with s. dove und s. mahboobi, we have
addressed the question why this might be the case [130].
since crystal structures of the kinase domains of neither
pdgf receptors nor  xxxg801xxx  are available, a structure of sti571
bound to the kinase domain of the pdgfbeta-receptor was
obtained by molecular modeling (fig. 4). this structure has
great similarity to the crystal structure of sti571 in complex
with the abl kinase domain [131, 132]. upon comparison of
the primary amino acid sequences of pdgfbeta-receptor and
 xxxg801xxx  in the parts of the kinase domain contacting sti571, we
observed a remarkable sequence difference in the beta5 strand,
which is otherwise highly conserved. instead of a threonine
(aa 681) in the pdgfbeta-receptor, the  xxxg801xxx  sequence contains a
phenylalanine (aa 691). according to the model, the
hydroxyl group of t681 is engaged in a hydrogen bond with
sti571. replacement of threonine with phenylalanine in a
model of  xxxg801xxx  in complex with sti571 (fig. 4) not only
renders such hydrogen bond impossible. the phenylalanine
side chain would sterically interfere strongly with sti571
binding. that this is indeed the case was shown by mutating
f691 in  xxxg801xxx  to threonine. both f691t  xxxg801xxx  wildtype as well
as f691t  xxxg801xxx -itd are sensitive to sti571 to a similar extent
as pdgfbeta-receptor. vice versa, the pdgfbeta-receptor t681f
mutant is completely resistant to sti571 [130]. these
findings highlight the importance of threonine 681 in the
pdgfbeta-receptor beta5-strand for susceptibility to sti571
inhibition. interestingly, in other studies the amino acid in
the homologous position in other kinases has also been
shown to have great influence on the sensitivity to kinase
inhibitors. for bcr-abl, sti571 resistant mutants occur in
patients who chronically receive the drug [133-135]. some

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 16 1875

of these are t315i mutations [133]. threonine 315 in abl is
homologous to threonine 681 in the pdgfbeta-receptor and its
replacement with isoleucine blocks sti571 in a similar
manner as the phenylalanine in  xxxg801xxx . another example is
 xxxg2198xxx  kinase. the wildtype enzyme has a threonine (aa
338) in the homologous position and it is sensitive to the
compound pp1 (agl1872) [136, 137]. the oncogenic
pp60v-src has isoleucine in this position and is not sensitive to
pp1 [136]. finally, it was demonstrated recently that the
susceptibility of the egf receptor to the very effective anilinoquinazoline inhibitor pd153035 can also be completely
eliminated by mutating the homologous threonine (aa 766) to
valine [138]. these studies have revealed some insight into
the structural basis for kinase inhibitor selectivitiy. on the
other hand, they may help the chemists to find novel inhibitors. for  xxxg801xxx , other pharmacophores than the one of sti571
are obviously required. as the title of a recent review on this
issue says, ‘finding the next gleevec’ is a current challenge
[121].
3.3.  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors from different structural families
one promising pharmacophore has also been initially
desribed in a series of pdgf receptor kinase inhibitors, the
bis(1h-2-indolyl)-1-methanone moiety [139]. in this compound family, potent direct inhibitors of  xxxg801xxx  kinase activiy
and signaling as well as of  xxxg801xxx -dependent proliferation such
as d-65476 were identified [140]. importantly, the compounds also suppress the anti-apoptotic effect mediated by
flt-itd and, under conditions of partial inhibition of flt3itd, restore a signaling profile which resembles  xxxg801xxx 
wildtype [53]. another inhibitor family for pdgf receptors,
c-kit, and  xxxg801xxx  comprises tricyclic quinoxalines as agl2043
[141] (fig. 3a). efficacy of both compound families in vivo
has not yet been demonstrated.
indolinones are another class of compounds which,
depending on substitution, have efficacy on a wide variety of
tyrosine kinases [142-144]. previously, the compound
 xxxd3191xxx  ( xxxd3191xxx ) (fig. 3a) from this series has been
described to be a dual inhibitor of vegf receptor–2 ( xxxg1274xxx )
and c-kit kinases [142, 145], which does not inhibit pdgf
receptors. however, the compound has also substantial
efficacy in inhibiting  xxxg801xxx  [146]. based on its anti-angiogenic
potency,  xxxd3191xxx  was already in phase ii and phase iii
clinical trials and had a proven safety record in the clinic.
thus, it rapidly entered studies for the treatment of aml.
recently published first results demonstrate some biological,
but little clinical efficacy, when  xxxd3191xxx  was used as a single
drug [147, 148]. a more potent  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor from the
indolinone family is  xxxd3264xxx  (fig. 3b). this compound has
an ic50 of 250 nm or 50 nm for  xxxg801xxx  wildtype or  xxxg801xxx -itd
in intact cells, respectively [149]. in addition, it inhibits pdgf
receptors, the vegf receptor-2/ xxxg1274xxx , and c-kit [150]. in
preclinical tumor models using  xxxg801xxx -itd-expressing human
leukemia cell lines,  xxxd3264xxx  induced regression of large,
subcutanous tumors and improved survival in a bone marrow
engraftment model [149].
another group of kinase inhibitors that holds promise for
the treatment of aml consists of two classes of indolocarbazole derivatives. one group, exemplified by  xxxd2458xxx 
(fig. 3b) was initially found as an inhibitor of the nervegrowth factor receptor trka [151-153]. recently,  xxxd2458xxx

was demonstrated to potently inhibit  xxxg801xxx  (ic50 2-3 nm)
[154]. with lower potency, it also inhibits the vegf receptor-2/ xxxg1274xxx  and pdgf receptors. as many indolocarbazoles,
it has also potency against pkc isoenzymes. in balb/c mice
injected with  xxxg801xxx -itd expressing ba/f3 cells,  xxxd2458xxx 
application led to prolonged survival [154]. another compound from this family is  xxxd2642xxx  (fig. 3b), which was
initially described as a pkc inhibitor [155]. it is a moderate
 xxxg801xxx  inhibitor in vitro (ic50 about 0.5 µm) but it has high
potency in intact cells (ic50<10 nm) [156]. the reason for
this discrepancy is not known. interestingly,  xxxd2642xxx  inhibits constitutively active forms of  xxxg801xxx  [101, 156] but not
wildtype  xxxg801xxx . besides  xxxg801xxx  and pkc,  xxxd2642xxx  also inhibits

pdgf receptors, the vegf receptor-2/ xxxg1274xxx , and, with lower
efficacy, c-kit [155]. in vivo application of  xxxd2642xxx  strongly
improved survival of mice with a myeloproliferative syndrome induced by transplantation of  xxxg801xxx -itd-transduced
bone-marrow [156]. very recently, a structurally somewhat
related compound, gtp-14576 (fig. 3b), has been described
as a novel  xxxg801xxx  inhibitor. it shares with  xxxd2642xxx  its selectivity for inhibiting  xxxg801xxx -itd-driven proliferation, albeit at
significantly higher concentrations. interestingly, however,
the compound inhibits wildtype  xxxg801xxx  and  xxxg801xxx -itd kinase
activity equally well. as in case of  xxxd2642xxx , the reasons for
the discrepancy in selectivity in the different assays are not
known [31].

 xxxg801xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  as a drug target in leukemia

of the  xxxg801xxx  f691t mutant sti-571 complex (lower panel). green – differing residues in  xxxg801xxx  compared to pdgf beta-receptor kinase. the sidechain of  xxxg801xxx  phenylalanine 691 is depicted in a space-filling representation (from [130] with permission of the publisher).

 xxxd3287xxx , another potent inhibitor of wildtype  xxxg801xxx  and
 xxxg801xxx -itd (ic50 in intact cells 30-100 nm) derives from the
piperazonyl quinazoline class [157]. it also inhibits pdgf
receptors and c-kit with similar efficacy but it is 15-20 times
less effective against  xxxg525xxx / xxxg525xxx . treatment with
 xxxd3287xxx  improved survival of mice in a ba/f3 nude mouse
model of  xxxg801xxx -itd-induced leukemia, and in a bone-marrow
transplantation model of  xxxg801xxx -itd induced myeloproliferative disease [157].

an interesting aspect, which emerged in the study of the
various  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors was a frequently observed differential
effect on  xxxg801xxx  wildtype and on the activating mutations. for
example,  xxxd1606xxx  apparently inhibited  xxxg801xxx -itd better than
 xxxg801xxx  wildtype [126], whereas  xxxg801xxx -itd and  xxxg801xxx  i836del were
inhibited equally well. the same compound did not have any
activity towards  xxxg801xxx  d835y [101]. as stated above,
 xxxd2642xxx  did not inhibit  xxxg801xxx  wildtype [156], but inhibited
catalytic domain mutants of  xxxg801xxx  even better than  xxxg801xxx -itd

1878

current pharmaceutical design, 2004, vol. 10, no. 16

[101]. these findings implicate that the catalytic domain
structures of  xxxg801xxx  and different activated mutants are likely to
be rather different. on the other hand, knowledge of the
different activity profiles may be critical to choose the proper
compound for treatment of a given patient. another
interesting aspect is the potency of several of the abovedescribed compounds against the vegf receptor-2/ xxxg1274xxx .
bone-marrow angiogenesis has been associated with aml
[158, 159], and targeting the angiogenesis via the sidereactivity against  xxxg1274xxx  may have additional beneficial
effects. finally, compounds from diverse structural families
have efficacy for  xxxg801xxx . if several of them turn out to be
efficient in the clinic, there may be good options to treat
resistances which are likely to occur in a similar manner as
in the case of sti571 and bcr-abl. since a number of
compounds, including  xxxd3264xxx ,  xxxd2458xxx ,  xxxd2642xxx , and
 xxxd3287xxx  are currently in clinical trials, we will soon learn
more about these and other aspects of targeting  xxxg801xxx  with
small molecules.
conclusions and outlook
over the last years, much progress has been made to
define the role of  xxxg801xxx  mutations in aml. we know their
prevalence, clinical implications and their biological
consequences on proliferation and survival of myeloid
progenitor cells and leukemic blasts. the current knowledge
puts them in a promising position.  xxxg801xxx  mutations represent
the most common genetic aberration in aml, and their
primary consequence, constitutive activation of a tyrosine
kinase, can be effectively targeted by several compounds that
have been developed for other purposes and further,
specifically tailored compounds may follow. however,
several problems remain to be solved:
we do not yet know, whether the different  xxxg801xxx  mutations
and the relative expression levels of mutant versus wildtype
receptor have different biological consequences in aml
blasts. moreover, since  xxxg801xxx  has been described to have
important functions in antitumor immunity, it is not clear,
whether inhibition of wildtype  xxxg801xxx , a likely side effect of
many compounds, in clinical situations is always without
any harm.
much more work will be necessary to dissect the signal
transduction events involved in the different classes of  xxxg801xxx 
mutations. the molecular basis for the qualitatively different
signal transduction that has already been observed between
signals from ligand-activated wildtype receptors and
receptors activated by  xxxg801xxx -itd needs to be defined. how do
the mutations influence receptor localization, processing,
stability, and its interaction with signaling molecules? such
knowledge will lead to better understanding of the signaling
pathways involved in leukemic transformation and might
allow to target events downstream of  xxxg801xxx  mutations, but not
of wildtype  xxxg801xxx .
a further potential problem is the lack of specificity of
most  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors that are currently tested for
targeting  xxxg801xxx . is this going to be a favorable or an
unfavorable feature of the compounds? as long as the
therapeutic implications of their anti-angiogenic or broad
anti-hematopoietic characteristics in aml patients are not
known, we will learn most about the role of  xxxg801xxx  in aml
pathophysiology from the most selective agents. however, a

schmidt-arras et al.

multimodality approach, targeting several tyrosine kinases of
potential importance for aml maintenance with one
compound might prove to be clinically more powerful.
 xxxg801xxx  mutations cause a myeloproliferative disease in
primary mouse cells. the full feature of aml requires
additional, cooperating oncogenes. although many possible
cooperation partners are described, little is known about the
nature of such cooperating events. most importantly, it is not
clear whether the function of  xxxg801xxx  mutations is necessary for
the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype, or whether it
only plays a role in its initiation. an attractive idea to tackle
aml would be to separately target the different events that
contribute to the leukemic phenotype by a combination of
drugs. such a combination may or may not contain  xxxg801xxx 
inhibitors.
much of the enthusiasm about  xxxg801xxx -mutations as a molecular target in aml has been spurred by the exceptional
success of gleevec/imatinib in the treatment of cml.
although we all hope that a similar development for aml
will provide a major contribution against this deadly disease,
some scepticism is warranted towards the expectation that an
 xxxg801xxx -inhibitor in aml could be 'another gleevec', with high
durable remission rates if applied as a monotherapy. cml is
– at least in the chronic phase, where gleevec shows the
most promising results - driven exclusively by bcr-abl. as
described above, aml is driven by a more complex process
that depends on several cooperating oncogenic pathways,
and its dependence on continuous  xxxg801xxx  signals has not been
shown. also, chronic phase cml is a pre-malignant condition,
whereas aml is a fully malignant disease, more comparable
to cml blast crisis that almost uniformly relapses, even if it
is initially successfully treated with gleevec/imatinib. therefore, it is highly important that clinical trials with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that target  xxxg801xxx  are carefully designed.
hopefully, we will know after their completion whether  xxxg801xxx 
was successfully targeted in the patient and whether the
compounds induce biological effects in aml blasts. this
would then justify further development of these compounds
as parts of a drug combination – either with cytotoxic drugs
or with other selectively targeted therapies. even if the
remission rates should be disappointing, we will learn very
much about the compounds, the target, and the disease from
carefully designed clinical trials.
one result that can be anticipated almost with certainty is
the development of secondary resistance to  xxxg801xxx  inhibitors,
either by mechanisms involving molecular resistance of  xxxg801xxx 
or by events that render aml blasts independent from  xxxg801xxx 
signals. it will be important to be prepared for this development by collecting knowledge about the structural basis for
the described striking differences of compounds in their
interaction with various mutants and by developing animal
models that allow faithful simulation of resistance development.
even if only some compounds are successful in the clinic
– a large repertoire of novel molecular probes for  xxxg801xxx 
biology and signaling mechanisms is likely to emerge from
the described investigations. some of the compounds have
already been exploited to demonstrate the existence of
autocrine loops in myeloid leukemia cell lines such as eol1 [154], the role of  xxxg801xxx -itd in suppression of differentiation

 xxxg801xxx  receptor  xxxg2198xxx  as a drug target in leukemia

[112] and in maintaining a transformation-specific gene
expression profile [53].
 xxxg801xxx -mutations have gathered tremendous attraction from
scientists, the medical community, and from pharmaceutical
companies. with joint efforts involving basic sciences,
compound design, studies in animal models, and clinical
studies, they pose a great chance to profoundly change aml
treatment, which is not to be missed.
