sch 530348, a synthetic tricyclic 3-phenylpyridine, is an orally active fourth
generation himbacine-based antagonist of the protease-activated receptor
(par) -1, the primary receptor for thrombin on platelets in humans. sch 530348 is
the first in a new class of compounds that inhibit thrombin-mediated platelet
aggregation without affecting the enzymatic activity of thrombin on fibrinogen.
preclinical and initial clinical studies have demonstrated this compound to be a
highly potent inhibitor of thrombin-induced platelet activation, to have excellent
oral bioavailability and to have a favorable safety profile. these data suggest
that this compound has the potential to reduce the risk of ischemic events without
significantly increasing the rate of bleeding. two large phase iii clinical outcome
trials are currently underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sch 530348
for the management of acute coronary syndromes and the secondary prevention
of atherothrombotic events.

atherothrombotic vascular events, including
acute coronary syndromes (acs), cerebrovascular accidents (cva) and limb ischemia, are
a major global cause of morbidity and mortality [1,2] . the who lists ischemic heart disease
and cerebrovascular disease as the top two leading causes of death worldwide [1,2] . in 2006 in
the usa, an estimated 829,072 people died from
cardiovascular disease, representing 34% of all
deaths [3] . in addition, the morbidity of atherothrombotic vascular disease is substantial with
an estimated 789,000 new myocardial infarctions (mis), 470,000 recurrent mis and 795,000
new or recurrent strokes occurring in 2009 [3] .
the pathobiology of these acute events is
dependent upon platelet activation and aggregation leading to thrombus formation and downstream ischemia. it is recognized that patients
with established atherosclerotic disease are at an
increased risk of acute atherothrombotic events
compared with the general population [1,3] . as
such, antiplatelet therapies are a critical component of acute and secondary preventive treatment [4–7] . aspirin, despite its relatively weak
antiplatelet activity, confers a significant reduction in the risk of death or major cardiovascular
events and is the cornerstone of antithrombotic
therapy [5,7,8] . moreover, in patients with acute
coronary syndromes, the addition of a thienopyridine to aspirin achieves more potent platelet
inhibition and provides additional benefit [8,9] .
nevertheless, despite improved ischemic outcomes with dual antiplatelet therapy, including
newer, more potent thienopyridines such as prasugrel, a significant proportion of patients still
suffer recurrent events [10] . in addition, dual

antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine is associated with an increased risk of
bleeding [10] .
thus, despite the important clinical benefits
of current antiplatelet therapy, there remains a
need for further reduction of platelet-mediated
events with a more favorable safety profile with
respect to bleeding.
background & overview

platelets are produced by megakaryocytes and,
after leaving the bone marrow, they circulate for
approximately 10 days with their primary function of preventing hemorrhage. platelets initially
respond to sites of injury by adherence. this
response is mediated by the glycoprotein ib/v/ix
receptor complex, for which  xxxg2423xxx 
(vwf) is the major ligand, as well as by collagen
receptors on the platelet surface [11] .
subsequent activation of platelets is amplified
by the release of autocrine and paracrine factors including adenosine 5´-diphosphate (adp),
thrombin, epinephrine and thromboxane a 2,
recruiting circulating platelets to form a hemostatic plug [11] . the final pathway for all agonists is the activation of the glycoprotein iib/iiia
receptor for aggregation [12] . release of plateletderived substances from activated platelets initiates the coagulation cascade leading to conversion of p­rothrombin to thrombin and fibrinogen
to fibrin [13] .
the cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin leads to
stabilization of the forming thrombus; in addition,
thrombin plays a key role in the interplay between
the coagulation and platelet cascades, acting on
platelets as a potent activator. thrombin acts on

platelets through g-protein-coupled proteaseactivated receptors (pars) [11,14] . human platelets
express two such receptors, par-1 and par-4.
par-1 is the predominant  xxxg746xxx  on
platelets in humans. par-4 likely provides some
redundancy [11,15] . in total, four pars are known
in mouse and human. par-1 and par-4 are activated by thrombin while  xxxg747xxx  is activated by

trypsin [14] . par-3 is believed to function as a
co-receptor for par-4 facilitating cleavage and
activation of par-4 in mice [14,16,17] . par-1 is
present on platelets, endothelial cells and smooth
muscle cells. thrombin activation of the par-1
receptor is mitogenic in endothelial and smooth
muscle cells [18] . in addition, thrombin acts on
t-lymphocytes triggering calcium signaling [17] .
currently available oral antiplatelet agents
target specific pathways for platelet activation.
aspirin inhibits the generation of thromboxane a 2 and the thienopyridines inhibit adpinduced activation of platelets by antagonism of
the purigenic receptor  xxxg1645xxx . treatment with each
of these classes of agents is effective at reducing
recurrent atherothrombotic events, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. the
association with bleeding may be, in part, the
result of cross-talk between inhibition of these
pathways and collagen- and vwf-mediated activation of platelets that contribute importantly
to normal hemostasis. there remains a need for
newer agents that offer incremental antiplatelet
effects without the increase in bleeding associated with dual a­ntiplatelet therapy with the
potent thienopyridines.

as a potent activator of platelets, thrombin acts
primarily through par-1. thrombin binds to
and subsequently irreversibly cleaves the amino
terminus of the extracellular loop of the receptor at arg41-ser42 . this new amino terminus
becomes a tethered ligand that undergoes a
conformational change, folding back over the
receptor to auto-activate the transmembrane
protein (figure 1) [17,19] . activation of the receptor initiates g-protein-coupled processes [11,20] .
par-1 is coupled to g12 and g13, and when
activated the a-subunits of these proteins
bind rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factors
(rho-gef) [11] . this leads to rho-mediated
cytoskeletal responses and platelet morphologic
changes [11] . in addition, par-1 is coupled to
gq and gi, which lead to increased intracellular
ca 2+ and decreased camp, respectively [11] . this
ultimately changes the ligand-binding properties
of the glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor, allowing it
to bind soluble adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen and vwf, further stabilizing platelet aggregation [11,20] . in addition, thrombin-mediated
activation of platelets leads to release of further
activators including adp, serotonin and thromboxane a 2 [17] . activated par-1 is rapidly uncoupled from signaling, internalized and delivered
to the lysosome for degradation [17] .

therefore, compounds with an affinity for the
par-1 receptor have been evaluated as potential
antagonists [21,22] . sch 530348 binds to the site
of auto-activation, preventing the tethered ligand
from interacting with the binding domain. this
interaction of the thrombin-receptor antagonist
is thus specific to the cellular actions of thrombin and does not interfere with thrombin’s role
in the coagulation cascade. other par-1 inhibitors, including sch 602539 (formulated for
intra­venous administration), as well as other
approaches to par-1 inhibition including peptide
mimetic par-1 antagonists (e.g., rwj 58259)
and bicyclic amidine-based compounds (e.g.,
e-5555), have been investigated but will not be
discussed in any additional detail in this review.
chemistry

himbacine, a naturally occurring complex piperdine alkaloid, has been isolated from the bark
galbulimima baccata species of the magnolia family [23] . while this substance initially drew attention as a promising agent for alzheimer’s disease
owing to its antimuscarinic properties, it has been
found to bind to par-1 and has been used as the
basis for development of par-1 antagonists [24–26] .
four generations of thrombin-receptor antagonist have been developed and investigated.
the first three all competitively bind to par-1
with high affinity and were found to strongly
inhibit cynomolgus monkey platelet aggregation
ex vivo [24–26] . in an effort to improve pharmaco­
kinetics and potency, a fourth-generation compound was developed and found to be 30-times
more potent then the initial candidates in inhibition of ex vivo cynomolgus monkey agonistinduced platelet activation. this compound,
sch 530348, is a synthetic tricyclic 3-phenylpyridine ( xxxd3527xxx .h2so4, molecular mass
590.7) and an orally active himbacine-based
thrombin-receptor antagonist (f igur  xxxd2037xxx ) [26] .
owing to its promising characteristics, this
fourth-generation thrombin-receptor antagonist
was selected for further development [26,27] .
pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics
& metabolism

in preclinical studies in cynomolgus monkey
platelets, oral administration of sch 530348 at
a dose greater than 0.1 mg/kg resulted in 100%
inhibition of thrombin-receptor agonist peptide
(trap)-induced platelet aggregation for 24 h
with partial recovery occurring at 48 h [26] .
in subsequent studies using human plateletrich plasma, sch 530348 potently inhibited
thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation with a

50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 47 nm
and inhibited trap-induced platelet aggregation at an ic50 of 25 nm [26] . these effects were
seen without changes to adp, thromboxane a 2
or collagen-induced platelet aggregation [26] .
sch 530348 also had no affect on the prothrombin time (pt), partial thromboplastin
time (ptt), or activated partial thromboplastin
time (aptt) [26] . moreover, sch 530348 caused
no increase in the bleeding time or in surgical
bleeding compared with inactive control [28] . the
compound was found to be selective for par-1
when tested over a number of ion channels and
receptors, including par-4 receptor [26] .
when administered orally to cynomolgus
monkeys, sch 530348 had excellent bioavailability (86%) [26] . testing showed no cytochrome p450 (cyp450) enzyme inhibition in
human liver microsomes, even at levels as high as
90 µm. the compound is primarily metabolized
and eliminated by biliary and gastrointestinal
routes. preclinical testing has suggested an excellent safety margin at the concentrations intended
for human studies [26] . in summary, this fourthgeneration thrombin-receptor antagonist was
found to have excellent oral bioavailability, and
to be a potent inhibitor of trap-induced platelet aggregation without causing alteration in the
aptt, pt or bleeding time [26] .

parallel-group study of sch 530348 [29] . subjects
were randomized in a 3:1 fashion (active to placebo) to receive the oral agent at various doses
(5–40 mg). trap-induced (15 µm) platelet
aggregation (pd), pk, bleeding time, coagulation tests and safety tests were assessed prior
to administration and at set post-dose time
points [29] . sch 530348 caused significant
dose-related inhibition of trap-induced platelet
aggregation with maximum inhibition as early
as 1 h (with 20 and 40 mg doses) with effects
maintained for over 72 h and adverse events
were considered mild (figure 3) [29] . a separate
phase i study reported an optimal dosing of

three phase ii studies of sch 530348 have
been completed (table 1) . in the largest of these
three trials – the  xxxg746xxx  antagonist
percutaneous coronary intervention (tra‑pci)
trial – 1030 subjects undergoing nonurgent
percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) or
coronary angiography with planned pci were
enrolled [31] . subjects were randomized in a 3:1
ratio to receive a loading dose (10, 20 or 40 mg)
or placebo; those treated with pci comprised
the primary study cohort and were to continue
maintenance dosing (0.5, 1.0 or 2.5 mg daily) for
60 days [31] . for patients scheduled to undergo
pci, anticoagulant therapy was administered
(unfractionated heparin, low-molecular weight
heparin or  xxxd348xxx ) [31] . patients in whom
glyco­­protein iib/iiia ( xxxg1202xxx /iiia) antagonist was
planned or who had taken a  xxxg1202xxx /iiia antagonist within 30 days were excluded. however,
provisional use of a  xxxg1202xxx /iiia antagonist for
thrombotic complications was permitted.
the primary objective of the study was to
evaluate the safety and tolerability of the compound at various doses. of the 573 subjects who
underwent pci, over 95% received both aspirin
and clopidogrel, with almost one third receiving a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel [31] .
approximately half received unfractionated heparin and half received  xxxd348xxx , while less than
10% received  xxxg1202xxx /iiia antagonist (table 2) .
the majority of patients achieved greater than
80% inhibition of trap-induced platelet aggregation by 1–2 h after a 4‑mg loading dose and the

no associated increase in the primary safety end
point, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
(timi) major plus minor bleeding, when added
to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and compared with placebo (table 3) [31] .
similarly, timi major bleeding did not differ

common adverse events leading to cessation of
study drug included non-timi bleeding and
nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, and with
similar rates in those taking placebo and those

the number of patients requiring more then
two units of  xxxd187xxx  was not different (17%

trial was not designed with sufficient power to
formally test efficacy, numerically fewer patients
treated with sch 530348 experienced a death,

conclusion

atherothrombotic vascular disease is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality. the
e­lucidation of the pathobiological processes

440

future cardiol. (2009) 5(5)

underlying these events has brought focus on
the importance of platelets and platelet inhibition. targeted antiplatelet therapies including
aspirin and thienopyridines have significantly
reduced the risk of recurrent events in patients
at risk. in spite of these advances, a significant risk of serious recurrent events remains
in patients with a history of atherothrombotic
disease. at the same time, there is growing
recognition of the increased risk and potential long-term consequences of significant
bleeding that is a­s sociated with more potent
­platelet inhibition.
therefore, a need remains for novel agents
that may reduce the rates of recurrent atherothrombotic events through incremental platelet inhibition, but with little or no increase in
bleeding. sch 530348 is the first of a novel
class of agents antagonizing thrombin-mediated
platelet activation through selective antagonism
of the platelet par-1 receptor. this approach
to platelet inhibition preserves other pathways
for platelet activation and has no effect on the
enzymatic activity of throm­bin on fibrinogen,
thereby potentially minimizing bleeding complications. preclinical and c­l inical studies to
date have demonstrated a f­avorable bleeding
and overall safety profile of this compound.
large clinical outcomes trials to e­valuate the
safety and efficacy of sch 530348 are ongoing
in patients with nste-­acs and for secondary
prevention in stable patients with a h­istory of
atherothrombotic vascular disease.
