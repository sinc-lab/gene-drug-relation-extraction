summary
 xxxd2678xxx  (mpa) is a mycotoxin commonly found as
penicillium genus secondary metabolite in feedstuﬀs and
silages. feeding with mpa contaminated silages may modulate the immune system in the farm animals and can cause
appetite lost, ketosis, paralysis and abortion. the aim of the
present study was to characterize the long-term mpa eﬀect on
both the  xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase (impdh)
isoforms i and ii mrna expression in white blood cells
(wbc) and various tissue of healthy sheep. in treated animals
300 mg mpa/day/sheep was applied. in all investigated tissues
the impdh i and ii mrna was abundant: wbc, spleen,
thymus, ileum, jejunum, kidney, liver, pharyngeal and
mesenterial lymph node. an eﬃciency-corrected relative
quantiﬁcation of the impdh types i and ii isoforms mrna
were performed by normalizing with the constant reference
gene expression of b-actin. high impdh i mrna expression
levels were seen in kidney > mesenterial lymph node > jejunum > spleen > pharyngeal lymph node. medium and low
abundance was found in ileum > wbc > liver > thymus.
type ii mrna was highly expressed in liver > thymus >
jejunum. in pharyngeal lymph node > spleen > ileum >
mesenterial lymph node > kidney > wbc medium to low
impdh ii mrna concentrations were detected. under mpa
treatment the impdh i mrna expression was not signiﬁcantly regulated in wbc, only trends of down- and upregulation were observed. surprisingly in jejunum an upregulation
could be observed (p < 0.05). in pharyngeal lymph node a
tendency to downregulation was shown. this may be due to
frequent ruminant activities and frequent exposition of mpa
to the pharyngeal lymph nodes. in contrast to type i mrna
expression, impdh ii mrna was signiﬁcantly downregulated in ileum (3.4-fold, p < 0.01) and tendencies in
downregulation could be seen in jejunum (5.1-fold, p ¼ 0.14).
in addition, signiﬁcant downregulation of impdh ii gene
expression over the entire feeding experiment could be shown
in wbc of mpa-treated animals compared with untreated
animals (p < 0.05). in conclusion, the recent study demonstrates that feeding sheep with mpa-contaminated silage did

introduction
the main issue of feed quality and storage is the problem of
mould spoilage (auerbach et al., 1998), where fungal growth,
production of mycotoxins and allergenic spores reduces the
nutritional value of feed. penicillium roqueforti is present in
most silages (auerbach et al., 1998; boysen et al., 2000)
and produces mycotoxins, e.g.  xxxd2678xxx  (mpa)
(schneweis et al., 2000). feeding with mpa-contaminated
silages may modulate the immune system in the farm animals
and can cause appetite lost, ketosis, paralysis and abortion.
 xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase (impdh) has
been identiﬁed to be an aﬀected key enzyme in the de novo
synthesis of the guanine nucleotides (bentley, 2000). guanine nucleotides are the essential precursor for rna and
dna biosynthesis, and therefore, the central role in purine
metabolism (weber et al., 1996). inhibition of impdh
through mpa is associated with changes in nucleic acid
synthesis, gene expression, signalling and ultimately, cell
proliferation and diﬀerentiation, especially in blood leucocytes (zhang et al., 1999). mammalian impdh is very
sensitive to mpa inhibition, by uncompetitive inhibition of
both mammalian impdh isoforms (digits and hedstrom,
2000; sintachak and nimmesgern, 2000). in human medicine
the ester pro-drug of mpa is used as an immunosuppressive
agent for the prevention of acute graft rejection in kidney,
heart and liver transplantation (mele and halloran, 2000).
impdh enzyme exists in two encoded isoforms, impdh
isoforms i and ii. each protein consists of 514 amino acids
with 84% sequence identity (weber et al., 1996). both
isoforms were shown to be expressed in most tissues (jain
et al., 2004). whereas impdh i is predominantly expressed
in resting human lymphocytes, impdh ii is the inducible
enzyme responsible for cell diﬀerentiation and is mainly
found in activated lymphocytes (allison and eugui, 2000) as

well as in leukaemic and tumour cells (konno et al., 1991;
nagai et al., 1992). mpa is a ﬁve-fold more potent inhibitor
of impdh ii than of impdh i mrna expression (carr
et al., 1993) and is capable of inducing apoptosis in human
t-lymphocytes (cohn et al., 1999). the aim of the present
study was to characterize the mpa eﬀect on the impdh i
and ii mrna expression in white blood cells (wbc) and
various immunological tissue of healthy sheep over a longterm mpa treatment over 9 weeks.

materials and methods
animal experiment and tissue sampling
eighteen 6 month old male cross-breed sheep (merino landschaf · schwarzkopfschaf), with no clinical signs of any
infectious diseases were investigated over 9 weeks. the animals
were kept in a pen of 15 m2 with a 12-h light cycle and a
temperature of 15–20c. the sheep were fed with maize silage
(2 kg/animal daily) and hay (semi-ad libitum) according to
kirchgeßner (1987). water was supplied ad libitum. the
general health status, including the rectal temperature, was
examined daily. the body weight was measured at the
beginning, in the middle and at the end of the trial (days 0,
22 and 40). blood samples were collected twice per week via
the vena jugularis before and during treatment in weeks 1, 2, 5
and 9. miscellaneous haematological and biochemical parameters were examined: number of erythrocytes, thrombocytes,
leucocytes, diﬀerential blood picture, the packed cell volume,
the concentrations of haemoglobin, glucose, bilirubin, activity
of alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase and
glutamate dehydrogenase. after the treatment period the sheep
were slaughtered at the slaughterhouse in grub (eu oﬃcial
slaughterhouse of the bayerische landesanstalt für tierzucht,
poing, germany) tissue samples were collected 10–15 min
postmortem and stored in liquid nitrogen until total rna
preparation.
reverse transcription
total rna was extracted from tissue and wbc according
to earlier publications (pfaﬄ et al., 1998). synthesis of ﬁrst
strand complementary dna (cdna) from 1 lg total rna
was performed in 50 ll with mmlv rnase h-reverse
transcriptase (promega, madison, wi, usa) using random
hexamer primers (mbi ferments, st leon-rot, germany),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a conventional thermocycler (personal cycler; biometric, göttingen,
germany).
oligonucleotide primer and identification of ovine impdh
isoforms
the ovine impdh i and ii sequences were unpublished.
primer pairs were designed, according to available human and
mouse  xxxg1186xxx  sequences (ncbi accession no. xm-093044,
bg276942) and human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee and zebraﬁsh
(ncci accession no. bc006124, bc052671, bc060585, xm516452 and bc046905) using husar analysis package
software, version 4.0 (http://genome.dkfz-heidelberg.de/biounit/) for a multiple sequence alignment and clustal primer
design (husar, dkfz, heidelberg, germany). impdh i

primer 5¢-gag gag atg atg ccc acc a-3¢; rt-pcr
product length 191 bp) were manufactured by mwg biotech
(ebersberg, germany) and optimized in real-time rt-pcr.
to conﬁrm constant reference gene expression levels in the
studied total rna extractions derived from leucocytes and
targeted tissues, b-actin was used as reference gene in real-time
rt-pcr. b-actin primers (sense-primer 5¢-aac tcc atc
atg aag tgt gac g-3¢; and anti-sense primer 5¢-gat
cca cat ctg gaa gg-3¢; rt-pcr product length
234 bp) were designed using a published ovine nucleic acid
sequence (ncbi accession no. u39357).
quantification by real-time pcr
quantitative analysis of pcr products was carried out in the
lightcycler 1.0 (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany).
one microlitres of reverse transcribed total rna (20 ng/lg)
was used as pcr template. further reaction components for
each reaction were: 1.2 ll mgcl2 (3 mm), 0.2 ll of forward
primer (4 pmol), 0.2 ll of reverse primer (4 pmol), 1.0 ll of
lightcycler-fast start master sybr green i (roche diagnostics) ﬁnishing with pcr water up to an end volume of
10 ll. prior to ampliﬁcation an initial denaturation step
(10 min at 95c) was performed to ensure a complete cdna
denaturation and polymerase activation. every real-time rtpcr was performed with 40 cycles. a fourth segment was
introduced in the cycle procedure at the end of each ampliﬁcation cycle, with an elevated temperature acquisition point
(impdh i and ii 86c and b-actin 87c). due to the fourth
segment and sybr green i quantiﬁcation we achieved only
speciﬁc rt-pcr product for an exact quantiﬁcation (pfaﬄ,
2001). ampliﬁed rt-pcr products underwent a melting curve
analysis to specify the integrity of ampliﬁcation and ﬁnally a
cooling step was performed.
relative quantification model
as exact quantiﬁcation model we performed an eﬃciencycorrected relative quantiﬁcation (pfaﬄ et al., 2002). the
crossing point (cp) was determined using the second derivate
maximum method determination by the lightcycler software
version 3.5 (roche diagnostics). in the applied quantiﬁcation
model, according to the shown equation, the impdh mrna
expression level was normalized via the b-actin expression level
(see displayed equation). the individual cp mean values and
corresponding real-time pcr eﬃciencies were calculated with
rest-xl software (pfaﬄ et al., 2002).

statistical evaluation
statistical analysis of relative expression levels in real-time
pcr was calculated by the relative expression software restxl using ôpair-wise fixed reallocation randomisation testõ
(pfaﬄ et al., 2002). the used mathematical model is based on
the pcr eﬃciency and the mean cps deviation between the
mpa treatment group and control group, normalized via the
reference gene expression (herein b-actin) as a reference.
statistical evaluation of the linear regression of the b-actin
reference gene cp over 9 weeks in wbc was performed using

results
extracted total rna contents showed no signiﬁcant variations
during mpa treatment period and compared with control
groups (data not shown). in all investigated tissues (wbc,
spleen, thymus, liver, kidney, jejunum, ileum, pharyngeal- and
mesenterial lymph node) the impdh i, impdh ii and b-actin
mrna was abundant. real-time rt-pcr products showed
the expected length of 307, 191 and 234 bp, respectively, and a
single peak in the melting curve analysis. sequences were
additionally veriﬁed by sequence analysis (medigenomics,
martinsried, germany). newly elucidated ovine impdh i
sequence was published (ncbi accession no. aj535327) in
sequence databases european molecular biology library
(embl; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and genbank (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/index.html). homology on
mrna level resulted in 92.8% and 79.8%; homology on
protein level 91.2% and 75.4%, compared with the published
human and mouse sequences (xm-093044, bg276942)
respectively. all investigated tissues and wbc showed tissuespeciﬁc real-time pcr eﬃciencies for the mrna quantiﬁcation assays (table 1).
b-actin reference gene expression
b-actin mrna expression data showed constancy in the
regulation in wbc (table 2) as well as in the investigated
tissues (table 3). b-actin was justiﬁed as a proper choice for a
non-regulated reference gene and optimal reference gene. a

linear regression (fig. 1) over nine weeks of mpa treatment
was plotted for each experimental group (n ¼ 66/67). the
mean cp value was 18.5 ± 1.8 for control (n ¼ 67) and
19.1 ± 2.6 for mpa group (n ¼ 66). linear and non-signiﬁcant regressions reﬂected the constant and not regulated
b-actin expression and showed no signiﬁcances between the
groups and treatment duration.
impdh isoforms i and ii mrna expression in wbc
in the untreated control group impdh i expression seems to
be minorly regulated, mainly downregulated (data not shown).
none of the trends in control group was signiﬁcant. in the
mpa-treated group impdh i mrna was expressed as a
trend of up- and downregulation as follows: in week 1 an
upregulation was detected (factor 6.2, p ¼ 0.14) and then
sharp drop of downregulation by the factor 0.19 in the second
week (p ¼ 0.13). this downregulation trend remained until
the last experimental week.
 xxxd557xxx  dehydrogenase ii mrna expression in wbc was much more regulated (fig. 2). on the y-axes
the mrna impdh ii expression level was plotted over
9 weeks, compared with week 0 (before treatment). data were
shown as logarithmic expression levels (2-log) or mrna upor downregulation gene regulation (x-fold levels compared
with start). week 0 of the mpa treatment was taken as 100%
(one-fold expression level ¼ 20). within the untreated control
group, impdh ii mrna was expressed as a trend of up-and
downregulation. no diﬀerences in impdh ii expression was
obtained until week 1, whereas from that point on mrna
expression was lower in the mpa-treated group (p < 0.05).
after the ﬁrst week, impdh ii expression was downregulated
by the factor 1.8, followed by an upregulation and reaching a
peak after 2 weeks. subsequently, the impdh ii expression
fell again until the end of the experiment to reach almost the
starting value. despite variations in the mrna expression,
none of the regulations in the control group was signiﬁcant.
within the treated group, a downregulation after the ﬁrst week
could be recognized. until week 5, the mrna expression of
impdh ii seemed to be increased, starting to decrease to the
level of week 1 up to week 9. comparing both groups over the
entire feeding experiment, signiﬁcant 1.4-fold downregulation
(p < 0.05) of impdh ii gene expression was observed in the
mpa-treated group.

discussion
mycotoxin-contaminated silage showed clinical symptoms in
cows, e.g. ketosis, mastitis, paralysis, and abortion (häggblom, 1990). to detect the immune suppressive potency of
mpa, total rna contents, marker gene impdh i and ii
mrna expression levels were quantiﬁed. quantitative realtime rt-pcr is a very sensitive method to quantify the low
amounts of mrna molecules in various tissues and oﬀers
important insights into the local expression of regulation
processes. the reliability of such a relative quantiﬁcation assay

depends on the sensitivity, low-assay variations and on a
suﬃciently wide quantiﬁcation range. herein we described the
design and validation of a relative quantiﬁcation using an
eﬃciency-corrected calculation model in real-time rt-pcr
(pfaﬄ et al., 2002) according to the demands of a fast cycle
pcr (rasmussen, 2001).
the central questions of our investigations in sheep were,
whether or not mpa contamination in silage has an inﬂuence
on the gene expression in wbc and numerous tissues, and
which tissues are more sensitive to mpa. high mpa concentrations were measured in liver (2.6 lg/g) or kidney (3.6 lg/g),
where mpa is metabolized and excreted (mohr, 2003). high
mpa concentrations exert potential immunosuppressive properties.
the chosen reference gene b-actin showed no regulation in all
investigated tissue samples. in jejunum a signiﬁcant upregulation of impdh i expression could be shown. for ileum, liver
and kidney only trends of regulation could be observed, which
correlates with the high mpa concentrations found. a signiﬁcant change in impdh ii gene expression could only be
detected in ileum with a downregulation by the factor 3.4. the
numbers of igg- or igm-positive plasma cells decreased in the
ileum with increasing mpa doses. these results suggest that
mpa in a high concentration may aﬀect the morphology of
immune organs of sheep (baum et al., 2005).
additionally, in jejunum a downregulation with tendency to
signiﬁcance was visible (p < 0.14). the results in ileum and
jejunum meets the expectations as these tissues are maximally
exposed to mpa because of its position in the body.
surprisingly, in the immunological active tissues like spleen,
thymus, pharyngeal- and mesenterial lymph node no signiﬁcant regulation of impdh types i and ii isoforms could be
observed. a trend of impdh i downregulation was observed
in pharyngeal lymph node. this might be due to a frequent
ruminant activity and possible absorption through the oral
cavity mucus, even at low eﬀective mpa concentrations. with
increasing dose of mpa, germinal centres in the retropharyngeal lymph nodes displayed an activated morphology with
numerous centroblasts. in the highest dose group, the sheep
showed shrinkage of thymic lobules (baum et al., 2005). in the
digestive tract, next to the immunological active ileum, we
expected a much more signiﬁcant suppression of the marker
gene expression.
total rna concentrations were quantiﬁed in all described
tissues, but no signiﬁcant eﬀects were evident after drug
application. furthermore, the expression levels for impdh i
and ii for both groups were monitored in wbc over the 9week treatment period. we observed no signiﬁcant regulation
of the proposed marker gene impdh i mrna as well as of
the reference gene b-actin. a possible explanation for the
missing signiﬁcance was the high inter-individual variability in
the impdh i mrna expression. in contrast to these results, a
signiﬁcant downregulation of impdh ii gene expression in
wbc could be seen in the mpa-treated sheep compared with
the control group. mpa is known to be a ﬁve-fold more potent
inhibitor of this isoform than of impdh i and has stronger
cytostatic eﬀect on lymphocytes than on other cell types
(allison and eugui, 2000). the results of this investigation
support this ﬁndings. these eﬀects could also be noticed in the
small bowel mucosa (jejunum and ileum), where large numbers
of intraepithelial lymphocytes are found in the villus epithelium (guy-grand et al., 1998). but in both cases, the greatest

eﬀects caused by mpa in wbc seemed to be achieved within
the ﬁrst weeks of treatment.
it was reported that mpa dose dependently blocks the
proliferation of human lymphocytes after stimulation with tor b-cell mitogens in vitro and inhibits impdh types i and ii
enzymes almost equipotently (eugui et al., 1991; jain et al.,
2001). our results are in contrast to jain et al. (2004), who
showed that treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with up to 1 lm mpa does not result in any
signiﬁcant changes in impdh types i or ii mrna and
protein levels induced in response to mitogenic stimulation and
in unstimulated cells. this may have been due to the diﬀerent
technologies used for quantifying mrna expression resulting
in no signiﬁcant changes of impdh gene expression levels. on
the other hand, it might be assumed that mpa has no
inﬂuence on the impdh mrna steady-state level in lymphocytes. the observed missing immunosuppressive eﬀects of
mpa via impdh expression inhibition in our study may have
resulted from the absence of substantial stimulation of the
immune system by pathogens. no clinical signs and signiﬁcant
alterations in the monitored haematological and clinical
parameters were noted from our observations in sheep treated
with natural occurring mpa concentrations even in the
applied worst case scenario group.
the experimental mpa concentrations in sheep were
designed according to a physiological silage uptake, an average
mpa concentration of 1.8 mg of mpa/kg body weight in
ruminants (schneweis et al., 2000). taking all available concentration of mpa uptake data together and create a worst
case scenario, an oral mpa application of 300 mg/sheep/day is
possible (auerbach et al., 1998). we applied a maximal dose of
5.0 lg mpa/g sheep bw (5 ppm) in relation to 250 lg mpa/
g mouse body weight (238 ppm), where an eﬀective immune
system suppression and prolonged sickness were achieved
(table 4). the highest applied doses in sheep were about 50fold less than in mice model. however, in mice such high per os
doses are required for an eﬀective immune suppression
(bentley, 2000).
there might be degradation of the drug in the lumen by low
ph values or degradation by micro-organisms (sweeney and
dobson, 1998). it is clear that microbial metabolism of
mycotoxins takes place and there is evidence of total mineralization of certain mycotoxins, the enzymatic pathway and
degradation products produced in that manner is not yet fully
known. a biotechnology approach to the detoxiﬁcation of
mycotoxins requires certain input from a research point of
view and could be a vital tool (sweeney and dobson, 1998).
in future studies valuable data could be obtained by direct
administration of mpa in tissue cell culture to see physiological pathways mechanisms on gene expression level of mpa
immunosuppressive action. possible candidates are cultured
wbc and tissue cell lines with a large dose range of mpa.
there, we could have better insight using real-time rt-pcr

assays analysing the impdh i and ii mrna and other
immune system activation marker gene responses.

conclusion
to conclude, in this study we have demonstrated:
1 signiﬁcant downregulation of impdh ii gene expression
in wbc over 9 weeks mpa treatment;
2 mpa treatment showed signiﬁcant up-regulation of
impdh i in jejunum and a signiﬁcant downregulation
of impdh ii gene expression in ileum;
3 mpa treatment showed tendencies of upregulation of
impdh i mrna in thymus, ileum, liver, kidney, spleen
and mesenterial lymph node;
4 mpa treatment showed tendencies of downregulation of
impdh i in pharyngeal lymph node and impdh ii in
jejunum;
5 mpa may have immunosuppressive eﬀects via lower
impdh i expression in pharyngeal lymph node, and via
impdh ii expression in the gastrointestinal immune
system in ileum and jejunum;
6 after feeding with natural occurring mpa concentrations
in contaminated silage, immune suppressive eﬀect are
only given via impdh ii expression inhibition.
