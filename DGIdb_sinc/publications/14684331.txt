abstract—e7070 [n-(3-chloro-7-indolyl)-1,4-benzenedisulfonamide] is an anticancer drug candidate under clinical development for
the treatment of several types of cancers. we prove here that this compound also acts as a potent carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibitor. similarly to the clinically used drugs acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx  and topiramate, e7070 showed inhibition constants in
the range of 15–31 nm against isozymes i, ii and ix, being slightly less eﬀective as a ca iv inhibitor (ki of 65 nm). the x-ray
crystal structure of the adduct of hca ii with e7070 revealed unprecedented interactions between the inhibitor and the active site,
with three diﬀerent conformations of the chloroindole fragment of the inhibitor interacting with diﬀerent amino acid residues/water
molecules of the enzyme. a superimposition of these conformations with those of other sulfonamide/sulfamate ca inhibitors
indicated that similar regions of the hca ii active site could be involved in the interaction with inhibitors.

1. introduction
sulfonamides possess many types of biological activities, and representatives of this class of pharmacological agents are widely used in clinic as antibacterial,
hypoglycemic, diuretic, anti-hypertensive and antiviral
drugs among others.1,2 recently, a host of structurally
novel sulfonamide derivatives have been reported to
show substantial antitumor activity in vitro and/or in
vivo.1 9 all these derivatives incorporate in their molecules a common chemical motif of aromatic/heterocyclic
sulfonamide, but there are a variety of mechanisms of
their antitumor action, such as inhibition of tubulin
polymerization, cell cycle perturbation in the g1 phase,
carbonic anhydrase (ca) inhibition, functional suppression of the transcriptional activator nf-y, angiogenesis (matrix metalloproteinase or integrin a2)
inhibition, and so on.1 9 among such compounds

selected via elaborate screenings of compound libraries
or obtained through computer-based drug design,
e7070 (1) is one of the most potent anticancer sulfonamides ever reported.8,10 12 this statement is based on
the signiﬁcant in vivo eﬃcacy of 1 against various
human tumor xenografts in nude mice, for example
colon carcinomas hct116, ls174t, sw620 and
hct15 and lung carcinomas lx-1 and pc-9.8,10 in
particular, this compound caused complete tumor
regression in the xenografts of hct116 and lx-1 following its intravenous administration at 25 mg/kg daily
for 8 days.10 currently, 1 is under clinical evaluation
(phase i trials in japan and phase ii trials in europe and
the united states), thus far demonstrating some objective antitumor responses in patients with colorectal
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and so on.11 14
the precise mechanism of action has not been determined, but 1 is considerably diﬀerent from conventional
anticancer drugs in clinical use with respect to its eﬀects
on the cell cycle and its tumor type selectivity. in
hct116, one of the most sensitive cancer cell lines, 1
was found to suppress the expression of cyclin e and the

218

f. abbate et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 14 (2004) 217–223

phosphorylation of  xxxg410xxx , both of which are essential
for the g1 to s transition.8 a more detailed mechanistic
study by fukuoka et al.15 clariﬁed that 1 disrupted cellcycle progression at multiple points, including both g1/
s and g2/m transitions, in a human non-small cell lung
cancer cell line a549. in their experiments using a549
and its 1-resistant subline a549/er, the compound was
shown to inhibit prb phosphorylation, to reduce the
protein expression of  xxxg365xxx , cyclin b1,  xxxg410xxx  and
 xxxg407xxx , and to suppress  xxxg410xxx  catalytic activity with the
induction of p53 and p21 proteins only in parental (drug
sensitive) a549 cells. all these observations suggest that
1 belongs to a new class of cell cycle inhibitors aﬀecting
multiple cell-cycle checkpoints. more recently, dna
microarray analysis has further revealed that the drug
treatment at 8 mm for 12 h altered at least 3-fold the
expression levels of 60 transcripts; 58 of these were
down-regulated, and the remaining two were up-regulated.16,17 an observation of particular interest is profound transcriptional repression of subsets of energy
metabolism and cell-cycle genes, including mitochondrial nad(p)+-dependent malic enzyme, dna polymerase a and cyclin h, all of which are also signiﬁcantly
down-regulated by 1 in common in several other cancer
cell lines (t. owa, unpublished data).
although the gene expression analysis has actually provided an important insight into the mode of action of 1,
it is also critical to identify a cellular protein target(s) of
1 for understanding accurately its anticancer mechanism(s). a most recent report by oda et al. has described
that  xxxg1389xxx  (cmdh) is a speciﬁc binding protein and apparently a primary cellular
target of 1 on the basis of quantitative proteomic analysis.18 independent of this study, we have investigated
whether 1 shows inhibitory activity against cas as this
compound is a primary sulfonamide ﬁtting for a general
formula of ca inhibitors.2,5 these enzymes play a key
role in a multitude of physiological and physiopathological processes, including tumorigenesis.2,5,6,19 recently,
at least two tumor-associated ca isozymes have been
identiﬁed (ca ix and ca xii)19 among the fourteen
isozymes isolated in humans.2,5,6 of these, ca ix shows
restricted expression in normal tissues but is tightly
associated with diﬀerent types of tumors, mostly due to
its strong induction by tumor hypoxia that involves
hif-1 binding to a hypoxia response element in the
ca9 gene promoter.19 ca xii is present in various
normal tissues and overexpressed in some tumors. it is
also induced by hypoxia, but the underlying molecular
mechanism remains undetermined. both ca ix and ca
xii are negatively regulated by von hippel lindau
tumor suppressor protein and their expression in renal
cell carcinomas is related to inactivating mutation of
vhl gene.19 the high catalytic activity of these two
isozymes supports their role in acidiﬁcation of tumor
microenvironment that facilitates acquisition of metastatic phenotype.19 therefore, modulation of extracellular tumor ph via inhibition of ca activity
represents a promising approach to anticancer therapy.
indeed, novel sulfonamide/sulfamate ca inhibitors with
nanomolar activity against the tumor-associated isozyme ix have been reported by this group,20 22 together

with classical sulfonamide drugs such as acetazolamide
2 and  xxxd2592xxx  3. on the other hand, recently
developed topically acting antiglaucoma sulfonamides
such as the bis-sulfonamide 423 and the perﬂuorophenyl
derivative of  xxxd2592xxx  524 or the sulfamate antiepileptic drug topiramate 625 have not been investigated
for their interactions with the tumor-associated isozyme
ca ix.

here, we report a detailed ca inhibition study of 1
against four isozymes, the cytosolic ca i and ii, the
membrane-bound isozyme iv, as well as the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme ca ix. an x-ray
crystallographic study for the hca ii–1 adduct has also
been performed, and is reported here. the structure of
this adduct evidenced unprecedented interactions
between the inhibitor and the enzyme active site and
may be useful for the drug design of more active agents
belonging to this class of pharmacological agents.

2. chemistry and ca inhibition
1 was prepared as previously reported.8 the other sulfonamides/sulfamates (2–6) used as reference compounds were either commercially available (2, 3 and 6)
or prepared as previously reported (4 and 5).23,24 inhibition data against four ca isozymes with the six compounds 1–6 are shown in table 1.
these data clearly indicate that 1 acts as a strong ca
inhibitor against the four investigated isozymes ca i,
ii, iv and ix, with potencies comparable to those of the
reference sulfonamide/sulfamate drugs 2–6, some of
which have been in clinical use for a long period as
diuretics, antiglaucoma agents, antiepileptics, and so
on.1 3,5,6 against the red blood isozyme ca i, 1 is the

219

f. abbate et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 14 (2004) 217–223

most potent inhibitor in this series of test compounds,
with an inhibition constant of 31 nm. compounds 2, 5
and 6 exhibit almost the same potency as ca i inhibitors, with ki values in the range of 250–270 nm, whereas
3 and 4 show inhibition constants more similar to that
of 1, in the range of 40–50 nm. against the most abundant and rapid isozyme, ca ii, 1 shows the same level
of inhibition as 2 and 3, with ki values in the range of
12–15 nm, whereas compounds 4–6 are more eﬀective
inhibitors, with ki values in the range of 1.5–5 nm. the
same level of inhibition as that of 2 is observed for 1
against the membrane-associated isozyme ca iv. these
two compounds possess ki values in the range of 65–
70 nm, whereas the other ones investigated here (3–6)
are slightly more eﬀective ca iv inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of 8–54 nm. the tumorassociated isozyme ca ix is also eﬃciently inhibited by
sulfonamides 1–5, which show ki values in the range of
18–29 nm, whereas the sulfamate 6 is a less eﬀective
inhibitor with an inhibition constant of 58 nm. thus, it
may be concluded that cas also constitute target proteins of 1, leading to a hypothesis that the ca inhibition
may in part explain its multifactorial mechanisms of
antitumor action.
structure and activity/gene expression relationship
studies of a series of 1-related antitumor sulfonamides
have so far clariﬁed that the sulfamoyl group
(–so2nh2) of 1 is not an essential functionality for the
in vitro growth inhibitory activity against cancer
cells.8,17 however, there is still a possibility that the ca
inhibitory properties of 1 may contribute, at least in
part, to its in vivo eﬃcacy. the isozymes most abundant
and considered to play a critical physiological/pathological role,5 7 such as ca ii and ca ix, exhibit the
highest aﬃnity for 1, with an inhibition proﬁle quite
similar to those of the clinical drugs 2 and 3. interestingly enough, 2 has been shown to reduce the invasion
capacity of renal cell carcinoma lines with high expression of cas ii, ix and xii in a model culture system26
and display synergistic eﬀects with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cisplatin and  xxxd2562xxx ) in animal
models.27 based on these ﬁndings, the ca inhibition of
1 might be considered as a positive factor for the clinical
strategy of anti-metastasis and combination therapies.

3. crystallography
the hca ii–1 adduct obtained by co-crystallization,
was subjected to detailed x-ray crystallography. the
programs shelx9731 and o32 were used to build the
model and to compute the fourier maps. the last
reﬁnement cycle yielded a ﬁnal r factor of 0.21
(rfree=0.25) with a ﬁnal temperature factor of the inhibitor atoms ranging between 8.5 and 24.0 å2. the ﬁnal
number of water molecules was 195 and the ﬁnal rmsd’s
from ideal geometry for bond lengths and angles were

are evidenced.

0.02 å and 1.8 , respectively. the statistics of data
collection and reﬁnement are shown in table 2. a ﬁnal
reﬁnement resolution of 1.9 å has been achieved.33
the structure reﬁnement allowed us to evidence the
spatial arrangement of the inhibitor within the active
site of the enzyme (fig. 1). the schematic, detailed
representation of the interactions of 1 with the metal ion
and amino acid residues/water molecules present in the
hca ii active site are shown in figure 2.
as seen from these ﬁgures, three diﬀerent conformations of 1 bound within the hca ii active site have been
evidenced, with three diﬀerent electron densities for the
terminal part of e7070 being observed. these conformations regard only the terminal, chloroindole fragment of the molecule, which is rather ﬂexible and allows
the three diﬀerent spatial arrangements, whereas the
benzenesulfonamide head binds unequivocally to the
active site in one conformation, similarly to other sul-

fonamide ca inhibitors for which the three-dimensional
structures have been reported in complexes with diﬀerent ca isozymes.34 38 thus, the ionized sulfonamide
moiety of 1 has replaced the hydroxyl ion/water molecule coordinated to zn(ii) in the native enzyme (zn–n
distance of 1.87 å), as in other hca ii–sulfonamide
complexes for which the x-ray structures have been
reported (fig. 2a).34 38 an important note is that the
zn–n bond is appreciably shortened in this complex as
this distance is usually around 1.95–2.10 å. this shortening may be considered as a ﬁrst factor favoring the
high aﬃnity of 1 for hca ii, as already documented
recently for the structurally related adduct of 4 with
hca ii.38 the zn(ii) ion remains in its stable tetrahedral geometry, being coordinated, in addition to the
sulfonamidate nitrogen of 1, by the imidazolic nitrogens
of his 94, his 96 and his 119. the proton attached to
the sulfonamidate nitrogen atom of the inhibitor also
makes a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of thr
199, which in turn accepts a hydrogen bond from

figure 2. schematic representation of 1 bound within the hca ii active site (ﬁgures represent distances in å). the three conformations of the
chloroindole fragment of the inhibitor bound within the active site and its interactions with amino acid residues/water molecules are detailed in a, b
and c. the interactions of the –c6h4–so2nh2 moiety of 1 with hca ii is the same for the three conformations a–c.

f. abbate et al. / bioorg. med. chem. lett. 14 (2004) 217–223

the carboxylic group of glu 106 (fig. 2a). one of the
oxygen atoms of the coordinated sulfonamidate moiety
makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of
thr 199 (o–h distance of 2.92 å), whereas the other
one is semi-coordinated to the catalytic zn(ii) ion (o–zn
distance of 3.28 å). these interactions are generally seen
in all complexes of hca ii with sulfonamide/sulfamate
inhibitors.34 38 the benzenedisulfonamide part of 1 lies
in the hydrophobic part of the active site cleft, where it
makes van der waals interactions with the side chains
of val 135, phe 131, leu 204, pro 202, trp 209, val 121,
leu 198 and thr 200. one oxygen of the secondary
sulfonamide moiety participates in two hydrogen bonds
with two active site water molecules (fig. 2a–c). in two
of the adopted conformations (a and b), these hydrogen bonds are identical, one of 2.78 å and the other one
of 3.47 å, whereas for the conformation c, two weaker
bonds are formed, of 3.22 and 3.51 å, respectively.
regarding the most notable and unprecedented interactions evidenced in this complex, the chloroindole fragment of the inhibitor (which lies in the hydrophilic half
of the active site) adopts three diﬀerent conformations,
in which it interacts with diﬀerent amino acid residues
and water molecules present in its neighborhood. thus,
in conformation a (fig. 2a), the endocyclic nh group

221

of the inhibitor serves as a hydrogen donor to the same
water molecule that was mentioned to form a hydrogen
bond with the secondary sulfonamide group. furthermore, the chlorine atom is also engaged in a weak
hydrogen bond with the cooh group of glu 69. in the
second conformation of 1 (fig. 2b), the presence of an
intramolecular hydrogen bond between the second oxygen atom of the secondary sulfonamide moiety and the
endocyclic nh group is evident. the same nh group of
the inhibitor is then involved in another hydrogen bond
(of 2.54 å) with the conh2 group of gln 92, a residue
known to play a critical role for the binding of sulfonamide/sulfamate inhibitors.25,34 38 the chlorine atom
forms this time a shorter (1.88 å) hydrogen bond with
the cooh group of glu 69. finally, the third conformation of 1 bound to hca ii (fig. 2c) involves only
a network of four hydrogen bonds in which one oxygen
atom of the secondary sulfonamide moiety and three
water molecules participate.
in order to better understand the signiﬁcance of our
ﬁndings, that is why 1 is a unique and strong ca inhibitor possessing three diﬀerent conformations when
bound within the hca ii active site, we superimposed
these conformations of 1 on those of three hca ii–

acid residues important for binding of these inhibitors (such as glu 106; thr 199; thr 200; gln 136; gly 132; phe 131; glu 69; asn 62 and gln 92),
the zn(ii) ion and its three protein ligands (his 94, 96 and 119) are also evidenced (cpk colors).

inhibitor adducts for which the x-ray crystal structures
have recently been reported by our group: the adducts
of hca ii with compounds 4–625,37,38 (fig. 3). to our
greatest surprise, we observed that conformation a is
superimposable to that of the hca ii–5 adduct, with the
chloroindole ring of 1 assuming a steric arrangement
very close to that of the perﬂuorobenzoyl ring of 5. on
the other hand, the second conformation of 1 (conformation b) overlaps quite well with 6 bound to hca
ii, with the chloroindole ring of 1 occupying the same
region of the active site as the sugar moiety of 6. the
third conformation (c) of 1 is in fact positioned
between the conformations a and b (see fig. 1) mentioned above and is not represented in figure 3 for the
sake of simplicity. it must also be mentioned that the
benzenesulfonamide moieties of 1 and 4 (possessing the
same head as 1) bound to hca ii overlap each other
completely. however, the tail of 4 adopts a totally different conformation, being oriented towards the hydrophobic half of the active site, whereas all the other
inhibitors discussed here prefer to orient their tails
towards the hydrophilic half.39

in conclusion, we prove here that e7070 (1), an anticancer sulfonamide under clinical development for the
treatment of several types of cancers, also acts as a
strong ca inhibitor. similarly to the clinically used
drugs 2, 3 and 6, 1 shows inhibition constants in the
range of 15–31 nm against isozymes i, ii and ix, being
slightly less eﬀective as a ca iv inhibitor (ki of 65 nm).
the x-ray crystal structure of the adduct of hca ii
with 1 revealed unprecedented interactions between the
inhibitor and the active site, with three diﬀerent conformations of the chloroindole fragment of the inhibitor
interacting with diﬀerent amino acid residues/water
molecules of the enzyme. a superimposition of these
conformations with those of other sulfonamide/sulfamate ca inhibitors indicated that similar regions of the
hca ii active site are involved in the interaction with
such inhibitors. these data may be used for the design
of novel ca inhibitors with antitumor activity or other
biomedical applications.

a stopped ﬂow variant of the pocker and stone spectrophotometric method (pocker, y.; stone, j. t. biochemistry 1967, 6, 668) has been employed, using an sx.18mvr applied photophysics stopped ﬂow instrument, as
described previously.20
the cdna of the catalytic domain of hca ix was
ampliﬁed by using pcr and speciﬁc primers for the vector
pcal-n-flag (from stratagene). the obtained construct was inserted in the pcal-n-flag vector and then
cloned and expressed in escherichia coli strain bl21gold(de3) (from stratagene). the bacterial cells were
lysed and homogenated in a buﬀered solution (ph 8) of
4 m urea and 2% triton x-100, as described by wingo et
al. (wingo, t.; tu, c.; laipis, p. j.; silverman d. n.
biochem. biophys. res. commun. 2001, 288, 666). the

homogenate thus obtained was extensively centrifuged in
order to remove soluble and membrane associated proteins as well as other cellular debris. the resulting pellet
was washed by repeated homogenation and centrifugation
in water, in order to remove the remaining urea and triton x-100. puriﬁed ca ix inclusion bodies were denaturated in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and refolded into
the active form by snap dilution into a solution of
100 mm mes (ph 6), 500 mm  xxxd3291xxx  mm  xxxd3556xxx ,
2 mm edta, 2 mm  xxxd2213xxx , 1 mm oxidized
glutathione. active hca ix was extensively dialysed into
a solution of 10 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 10 mm tris–hcl,
100 mm na2so4 and 1 mm  xxxd3556xxx . the amount of protein
was determined by spectrophometric measurements and
its activity by stopped-ﬂow measurements, with co2 as
substrate.30

sx.18mv-r applied photophysics stopped-ﬂow instrument has been used. phenol red (at a concentration of
0.2 mm) has been used as indicator, working at the
absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mm hepes (ph
7.5) as buﬀer, 0.1 m na2so4 (for maintaining constant
the ionic strength), following the ca-catalyzed co2
hydration reaction for a period of 10–100 s. saturated
co2 solutions in water at 20  c were used as substrate.
stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared at a concentration of 1–3 mm (in dmso–water 1:1, v/v) and dilu-

the hca ii–1 complex diﬀraction data were collected at
the elettra synchrotron in trieste (italy) on a 165 mm
marccd detector at 70 mm from the crystal, using
radiation of 1.00 å wavelength and 20-s exposure at
100 k. all calculations were done with shelx97 17 and
xtalview.31,32 these programs were used to build the
model and to compute the fourier maps. the last reﬁnement cycle yielded a ﬁnal r factor of 0.21 (rfree of 0.25).
the ﬁnal number of water molecules was 195.
