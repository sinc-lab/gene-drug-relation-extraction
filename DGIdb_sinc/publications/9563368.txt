development of  xxxd2145xxx  and
comparison with other inhaled corticosteroids
malcolm johnson, phd middlesex, united kingdom

 xxxd2145xxx  (fp) is a trifluorinated glucocorticoid
based on the androstane nucleus. it was selected for development from structure-activity relationships (topical anti-inflammatory, cutaneous vasoconstriction, and hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis suppression) of a series of 17bcarbothioates. fp is 3-, 300-, and 1000-fold more lipophilic
than  xxxd294xxx , budesonide, and  xxxd3418xxx , respectively. fp has an absolute affinity
(kd) for the  xxxg1601xxx  of 0.5 nmol/l and a relative receptor affinity 1.5-fold higher than beclomethasone-17monopropionate (17-bmp) and  xxxd2665xxx , 3-fold
higher than budesonide, and 20-fold higher than  xxxd2126xxx 
and  xxxd3418xxx . the rate of association of fp
with the receptor is faster and the rate of dissociation slower
than other corticosteroids. the resulting half-life of the fp
active steroid-receptor complex is >10 hours, compared with
approximately 5, 7.5, and 4 hours for budesonide, 17-bmp,
and  xxxd3418xxx , respectively. fp has high selectivity for the  xxxg1601xxx , with little or no activity
at other steroid receptors. fp is more potent than  xxxd294xxx , budesonide,  xxxd3418xxx , and  xxxd2665xxx  in inhibiting human t-cell
migration and proliferation, inhibiting  xxxg1202xxx  t-cell cytokine
and basophil histamine release, attenuating adhesion molecule expression, stimulating inflammatory cell apoptosis, and
inducing cellular antiprotease release. in asthma patients,
fp decreases the number of  xxxg1724xxx ,  xxxg1202xxx , cd81, and
cd251 t cells, mast cells, and eosinophils in bronchial biopsies, in addition to suppressing  xxxg376xxx -dendritic and ige1
cells and hla-dr. fp, therefore, has a good pharmacologic
profile for a topical steroid with increased intrinsic glucocorticoid potency and potent anti-inflammatory activity.

to exert anti-inflammatory activity, a corticosteroid
molecule must penetrate the cellular membrane and
demonstrate affinity for the steroid binding site on the
 xxxg1601xxx  (gr), leading to activation of
the receptor.1 dimerization of the active steroid-receptor complex occurs, and this can then enter the nucleus,
bind to glucocorticoid-responsive elements on a target
gene, influence gene transcription, and either inhibit
proinflammatory or potentiate endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms. alternatively, a direct interaction

of the gr complex with transcription factors may also
be an important determinant of steroid action and a key
mechanism by which glucocorticoids exert some antiinflammatory activity.1
the early development of corticosteroids based on the
structure of cortisol focused on increasing topical potency and improving glucocorticoid selectivity. the first
structure-activity studies attempted to find compounds
with greater anti-inflammatory activity. this was
achieved either by the insertion of an additional double
bond at the 1,2 position in the steroid nucleus; by the
introduction of 6a-fluoro, 6a-methyl, or 9a-fluoro substituents; or by a combination of these changes (fig. 1).
although anti-inflammatory potency was potentiated,
mineralocorticoid activity was increased to an even
greater extent.2 this effect was counteracted by further
substitutions with a-hydroxyl, a-methyl, or b-methyl at
the 16 position, for example, in dexamethasone (fig. 1).
a novel finding was that an ester function at the 16a,
17a, or 21a hydroxyl group was preferred, and this gave
rise to betamethasone 17-valerate, triamcinolone 16,17acetonide, and beclomethasone-17,21-dipropionate.2
these compounds have proved to be of value in the
treatment of the inflammatory component of bronchial
asthma and rhinitis and have shown little detectable
systemic activity when delivered by the topical route.
however, concern that long-term therapy may result in a
wide range of unacceptable systemic side effects such as
adrenal suppression, bone fracture, osteoporosis, and
inhibition of growth in children highlighted the need for
steroids with a better therapeutic index.
development of  xxxd2145xxx 
the development of  xxxd2145xxx  was an
attempt to produce a potent corticosteroid that exhibited improved airway selectivity (table i) compared with
earlier compounds. lipophilicity was identified as an
important physicochemical property for increased uptake and retention in lung tissue, resulting in enhanced
lung-systemic distribution and greater affinity for the

gr. the androstane nucleus, which is highly lipophilic,
was therefore selected as the basis of the chemical
program.3 topical activity was assessed by inhibition of
croton oil–induced inflammation of the ear in a mouse

model4 and inhibitory activity at the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis assessed by measuring reductions in circulating corticosteroids in response to
ether stress.5 the vasoconstriction/skin blanching assay6

was then used to confirm activity in human beings and to
rank compounds in order of anti-inflammatory potency.
the androstane 17b-carboxylates, which lack the normal two-carbon side-chain of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids at the 17 position, were of particular interest.3
the 17a-hydroxyl,17b-carboxylic acid was without activity in the vasoconstriction assay, with esterification being
necessary for topical activity. enzymatic hydrolysis of
either ester function, which can occur in vivo, would
therefore lead to inactive metabolites. the 17b-carboxylate series was superseded by the corresponding 17bcarbothioates.3 fluoromethyl analogues were, in general, more active than the corresponding chloromethyl
compounds, with the 17-propionate being preferred over
the acetate or butyrate; in addition, the presence of an
a-ch3 at position 16 reduced hpa axis–suppressing
activity (table ii). the most active compound in the
anti-inflammatory and vasoconstriction tests was the
6a,9a-difluoro, 17a-propionyl, 17b-carbothioate ( xxxd2145xxx ), which was approximately 2-fold and
10-fold more potent than bdp and  xxxd2128xxx , respectively (table ii). its low activity in inhib-

iting hpa axis function resulted from fp undergoing
complete first-pass metabolism in the liver to the inactive 17b-carboxylic acid. x-ray crystallography has
shown that the carbonyl of the 17b-substituent lies below
the plane of the ring rather than above it, which is
observed for other anti-inflammatory steroids.7 this
unusual shape, in which the carbothioate ester has
increased accessibility, may explain why fp readily undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis. fp therefore has a high
calculated therapeutic index (anti-inflammatory potency/hpa inhibitory potency) of 91, compared with 0.4
and 1.0 for bdp and  xxxd2128xxx , respectively.8
fp is 3 and 300 times more lipophilic than bdp and
budesonide, respectively, and .1000-fold more lipophilic than either  xxxd2126xxx  or  xxxd3418xxx .9 this degree of lipophilicity gives fp increased
deposition in lung tissue and a slower release from the
lung lipid compartment. in human lung fragments and
nasal tissue in vitro, uptake and retention of corticosteroids is in the rank order fp . bdp . 17-bmp .
budesonide .  xxxd2126xxx  . hydrocortisone.10, 11 in patients with asthma, after inhalation of a 1 mg dose, fp
exhibits a lung:systemic distribution ratio of 70 to 100,12
compared with previous reports of 7 to 10 for budesonide.13
receptor pharmacology
fp has a high affinity for the human lung gr (0.5
nmol/l),14 which is 1.5-fold higher than 17-bmp and
 xxxd2665xxx , 3-fold higher than budesonide,
and 10-fold higher than  xxxd3418xxx  and
 xxxd2126xxx  (table iii). unlike budesonide, which is a
racemic mixture of 22r and 22s enantiomers, fp does
not have a chiral center and therefore the measured
affinity represents the affinity of the molecule and not
the contribution of the individual enantiomers. in contrast to 17-bmp, the metabolite of bdp that has a
relative receptor binding affinity (rba) 5-fold higher
than the parent molecule, budesonide, with an rba of
7.8, undergoes a marked reduction in activity when
metabolized to either 6-hydroxy-budesonide (rba 5
0.06) or 16-a-hydroxy-prednisolone (rba 5 0.03). the

17b-carboxylic acid metabolite of fp has negligible
pharmacologic activity, with an rba ,0.01 at the gr.9
the rate of association of steroid with the cytosolic gr
is fastest for fp, followed by budesonide, triamcinolone
acetonide, and methyl prednisolone (fig. 2). in contrast,
the rate of dissociation of fp from the receptor complex
is slower than that of budesonide,  xxxd3418xxx , dexamethasone, and methyl prednisolone (fig.
2). these differences in gr kinetics for fp result in
differences in the stability of the steroid-receptor complex, which mediates the biologic and therapeutic activity of glucocorticoids.1 the half-life of the steroidreceptor complex for fp is .10 hours, compared with
approximately 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, and 7.5 hours for  xxxd2126xxx ,
 xxxd3418xxx , budesonide, and 17-bmp, respectively.9 fp is highly selective for the gr with ,0.001

and mineralocorticoid receptors.15 the selectivity ratio
of fp for the gr over the progestagen receptor is 1430,
compared with 267 and 237 for 17-bmp and budesonide, respectively.

anti-inflammatory activity
the steroid receptor profile of fp imparts a high
topical anti-inflammatory activity. the active fp-gr
complex binds to the gre on target genes (ec50 5 3
nmol/l) or interacts directly with activating protein-1
and/or nuclear factor-kb transcription factors (ec50
range 0.01 to 0.1 nmol/l) at significantly lower concentrations than either dexamethasone or budesonide.16
this has a good correlation with the respective potency
of fp in inhibiting gre-dependent cytokine (il-6, il-8)
synthesis (ic50 range 5 to 10 nmol/l) and non–gredependent cytokines such as  xxxg2296xxx -a
( xxxg2296xxx ) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor (ic50 range 0.01 to 0.1 nmol/l).
there is also a good correlation between the relative
affinity of these corticosteroids for the gr and their
relative potency in a number of intact inflammatory cell
systems (table iv). for example, fp is more potent than
dexamethasone, bdp, and budesonide in inhibiting human t-cell migration17 and proliferation,18 with ic50

s438 johnson

values of 0.3, 5.9, 2.0, and 0.8 nmol/l. similarly, anti–
cd3/cd28-induced  xxxg1180xxx  and il-4 secretion from  xxxg1202xxx 
t cells is inhibited by corticosteroids, with a rank
order of potency of fp .  xxxd2665xxx  .
budesonide . bdp .  xxxd3418xxx .19 fp
inhibits anti–ige-stimulated histamine release from
human basophils with an ic50 of 0.03 nmol/l, compared with 0.3, 0.6, 1, and 20 nmol/l for mometasone
furoate, budesonide, bdp, and  xxxd3418xxx , respectively.20 corticosteroids, in the presence
of  xxxg1180xxx , induce concentration-dependent apoptosis of
eosinophils, with fp (ec50 5 1.7 nmol/l) being 5
times more potent than budesonide and approximately 10 times more potent than triamcinolone
acetonide and  xxxd2126xxx .21 fp is also potent in
inhibiting cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression. at 1 nmol/l, fp inhibits  xxxg2296xxx -stimulated
 xxxg2048xxx  in human endothelial cells,22 whereas
8-fold higher concentrations of budesonide are required for the same effect. at a concentration of 100
nmol/l, fp is more effective than budesonide or
 xxxd3418xxx  in inhibiting intracellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in airway epithelial
cells.23 finally, abbin ante-nissen et al.24 have shown
that corticosteroids induce the synthesis of the antiprotease,  xxxg2168xxx 
(slpi), in human airway epithelial cells. fp is the
most potent steroid in inducing slpi, with an ec50 of
0.1 nmol/l compared with 1, 5, and 2 nmol/l for
 xxxd3418xxx , methylprednisolone, and
dexamethasone, respectively.
the rank order of affinity of corticosteroids at the gr
and their anti-inflammatory potency in vivo are similar.
in the mckenzie test, in which the cutaneous vasoconstrictor and skin blanching response is used to rank
anti-inflammatory potency of topical corticosteroids,6
fp is 1.5-, 2.5-, and 3-fold more potent than 17-bmp,
 xxxd2665xxx , and budesonide, respectively, and
10-fold more potent than  xxxd3418xxx  and
 xxxd2126xxx  (table iii). this is in agreement with dahlberg et al.,25 who had previously reported that the rba
predicts relative potency for inhibition of edema.
clinical studies
in patients with asthma, fp treatment (1 mg twice
daily for 2 months) significantly reduced the numbers of
mast cells (by 80.2%), eosinophils (by 93.6%), and t
cells (cd3, cd4, cd8, cd25; mean reduction of 86.5%)
in bronchial biopsy specimens.26 similarly, the presence
of dendritic ( xxxg376xxx ), ige1, and hla-dr1 cells in the
lamina propria was decreased after fp 1 mg daily for 3
months,27 suggesting attenuation of antigen recognition,
processing, and presentation. finally, fp (500 mg twice
daily for 8 weeks) results in a marked decrease in the
bronchoalveolar lavage levels of metalloprotease and an
increase in the concentration of the endogenous tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteases (timps),28 both of which
have been implicated in matrix protein deposition and
basement membrane thickening. fp, therefore, has good

j allergy clin immunol
april 1998

activity against the chronic inflammatory component of
bronchial asthma and may attenuate the degree of
airway remodeling.
the development of fp has resulted in a corticosteroid molecule with increased intrinsic glucocorticoid
potency and potent anti-inflammatory activity, coupled
with improved airway selectivity.29 fp is of considerable
clinical importance in the treatment of asthma and
rhinitis.
