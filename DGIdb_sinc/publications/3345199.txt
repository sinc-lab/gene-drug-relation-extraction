abstract-acetylcholinesterase
(ache) inhibited by the organophosphate soman (1,2,2-trimethylpropylmethylphosphonofluoridate)
rapidly becomes resistant to reactivation by oximes due to dealkylation of the soman-enzyme complex. this reaction is called aging. the effect of the four mono- and
bisquatemary ammonium compounds  xxxd3337xxx  (tma), hexamethonium,  xxxd1820xxx 
and suxamethonium on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited, solubilixed ache from human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro. all compounds were reversible inhibitors of ache; the respective
dissociation constants and the type of inhibition exhibited considerable differences. the affinities to
both the active and the allosteric site were considerably higher for suxamethonium (kii 81.3 pm; ki
15.9pm) and  xxxd1820xxx  (4 15.4pm; ki 4.4pm) than for tma (kii 1 mm; ki 289.6pm) and
hexamethonium (& 4.5 mm; ki 331.8 pm).
the reactivation experiments were performed in a four-step procedure @man-inhibition at 0” and
ph 10, aging at 37” and ph 7.3, reactivation by the oxime hi 6 at 37” and ph 7.3 followed by ache
assay). after these four steps (total duration 55 mm), ache was inhibited by soman to 95-100%. hi
6 could reactivate about 20% of the inhibited enzyme. all effecters increased the ache reactivatability
by hi 6 when added before aging was started. the maximal increase in reactivatability was higher in
the presence of 1.6 mm suxamethonium (+35.8%) and 150 @vf  xxxd1820xxx  (+40%) than of 22 mm
tma (+22.5%) and 8.3 mm hexamethonium (+19.2%). if the effecters were added after 5 min of
aging they increased the activity of soman-inhibited ache, but to a considerably smaller extent than
hi 6. a good correlation of the respective kii values and the effective concentrations of these drugs was
observed, indicating that an allosteric binding site of ache might be involved in the protective effect
of these drugs.

the principal toxic mechanism
of certain organophosphates, such as organophosphorus
pesticides
and the so-called nerve agents, is the inhibition of
the acetylcholinesterase
(acetylcholine
hydrolase,
 xxxg38xxx ) by phosphylation of its catalytic site. the
causal therapy of this intoxication consists of the
reactivation of the inhibited enzyme by removing the
phosphyl moiety. for that purpose, a large number
of pyridinium oximes, like p2s, tmb4, obidoxime
and the so called hagedom oximes, have been synthesized [l].
acetylcholinesterase
(ache) inhibited by the
organophosphate
soman
(1,2,2_trimethylpropylmethylphosphonofluoridate)
undergoes
a
rapid dealkylation of the soman-enzyme
complex.
after the pinacolyl moiety is removed from the
enzyme-bound soman, the phosphonylated enzyme
cannot longer be reactivated by oximes [2-41. this
reaction is called aging. the search for drugs preventing aging remains an urgent task, because, in
contrast to the enzyme of other species [s-8], human
ache inhibited by soman ages very fast (half time
about 1.3 min) [9].

boskovic [lo] suggested that the protection of the
anionic site of ache by quarternary ammonium
compounds might prevent the rapid dealkylation
(aging) of soman bound to the esteratic site of the
catalytic unit. up to now, nearly all beneficial effects
of quaternary ammonium compounds (like  xxxd3456xxx ,  xxxd2174xxx , methylpyridinium,
 xxxd1820xxx , hexamethonium
and others) on aging had
been demonstrated for non-human ache [ll-131 or
for organophosphates
other than soman (e.g. satin
[14]). the only positive effects on aging of human
enzyme have been reported by harris et al. [9] for
sad-128 and for atropine by kuhnen and schoene

a somewhat different mechanism of action for
bisquaternary ammonium compounds which might
also result in an increased reactivatability by oximes
has been suggested by ohnesorge [ 161 and ltillmann
et al. [17]. the authors inhibited ache with 3hdiisopropylphosphorofluoridate
(dfp) and found
that these compounds reduced the phosphorylation
rate of ache.
kinetic studies [18] revealed that different bisquaternary compounds ( xxxd2174xxx , pancuronium,
curare, succinyldicholine,
 xxxd1820xxx )
bind to
an “allosteric” site of ache thus exerting an indirect
influence on the active site. this allosteric site might

account for the above-mentioned
beneficial effects
on organophosphate-inhibited
ache.
the purpose of this study was to investigate the
influence
of several mono- and bisquaternary
ammonium compounds on the reactivatability
of
human erythrocyte ache inhibited by soman. particular attention was paid to perform most of the
experiments at physiological temperature (37”) and
ph (7.3).

aging experiments. the reactivatability of ache
after a 5-min aging period in the presence and
absence of an effector was measured by two methods,
a titrimetric (phstat method) and a photometric
assay. all effects were checked by both methods.
the procedure which is summarized in table 1,
consisted of four successive steps: inhibitionaging-reactivation-assay.
the
concentrations
given were final concentrations referred to the third
(reactivation)
step. the concentration
of hi 6
(320 pm) was evaluated as most effective in previous
experiments using different concentrations of hi 6.
essentially identical results were obtained by the two
different methods. control runs were performed by
replacing both the effector and the reactivator hi 6
or only the effector by distilled water. the results
were corrected for the spontaneous hydrolysis of
acetyl(thio)choline
in the presence or absence of hi
6 respectively.

and assay, were performed at ph 7.3 and 37”. for the

first step (inhibition) ache was incubated together
with soman in 3.3 mm verona1 buffer ph 10 at 0” to
prevent aging [4]. after 30 min, the enzyme was
inhibited to about 60% as found in separate experiments. at this moment, aging was started by mixing
the sample with 25 mm verona1 buffer ph7.0 to
obtain ph 7.3 (see table 1). at the same time, the
respective effecters were added. five minutes later,
reactivation was started by addition of hi 6. at
this moment (after 35 min total reaction time) the
enzyme activity in the absence of any effector was
still 612%.
the effecters were investigated at concentrations
of their respective kii values and then diluted or
concentrated
to investigate
the dose-response
relationship. all effects were checked for statistical
significance by a t-test for independent samples.

were added at concentrations of their maximal effectiveness (based on the results of the forementioned
experiments) together with, or without, hi 6 after

52 mm phosphate buffer ph 7.3 mixed with 0.25 mm dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid (ellman’s reagent) and

base of the lineweaver-burk plot shown in this figure. for the other quaternary compounds the same

and  xxxd1820xxx ) on the reactivation of soman-inhibited ache by hi 6. ache was incubated for
30 min in a solution containing soman at conditions preventing aging (o”, ph 10) [4]. before starting
aging by changing the temperature (37”) and ph (7.3), the respective compounds were added. after
5 min, ache was reactivated by hi 6 for 20 min. control runs were performed by replacing the effector
(soman + hi 6) or both the effector and hi 6 (soman) by distilled water. all results are expressed as

constants
of the four quatemary
ammonium compounds investigated are summarized
in table 2. although the type of inhibition appeared
to be similar for all compounds, there was a marked
difference in affinity: the dissociation constants (kii
and ki) for tma and hexamethonium
were about
two orders of magnitude higher than for suxamethonium and  xxxd1820xxx .
this indicated a
much higher affinity of the two latter compounds
to both the peripheral and the active site. for all

the kijki ratio was markedly higher
than 1. this was probably due to a higher affinity of
these compounds
to the active site than to a peripheral site. the kii/ki ratio was particularly
high
for hexamethonium
suggesting
that this substance
inhibits the ache competitively
rather than noncompetitively.

figures 2(a-d) show the effects of the bis- or

effecters on the reactivatability by
hi 6 of soman-inhibited ache after an aging period
of 5 min. the respective control runs without effector
and without or with hi 6 are shown on the bottom
of the graphs as hatched bars (mean + se). when
soman was added alone without effector or hi 6,
ache was found to be inhibited by 95-100% after
the whole experimental procedure. when hi 6 was
added after 5 min of aging, it reactivated about 1722% of the enzyme. this reactivatability could be
further increased by different effecters added at the
start of aging (at step 2, see table 1).

and suxamethonium exhibited a statistically significant (p < o.ol),
beneficial effect at considerably lower concentrations
(154 and 8opm) than tma and hexamethonium
(2.2 mm and 830 pm). the effectiveness of tma,
hexamethonium
and suxamethonium
exhibited a
dose-dependent
increase, whereas  xxxd1820xxx 
had a clear maximum of effectiveness at 150 pm. its
maximal effect was found at the lo-fold concentration of the kii value (see table 2). a further
increase resulted in a decreased efficacy (770 and
1500 pm).
to summarize the results, the reactivation of soman-inhibited ache by hi 6 could be improved by
the different effecters as follows (maximal effects in
the range of concentrations investigated):

the total reactivation obtained by these combinations reached maximal levels of about 60% of
the original ache activity (for  xxxd1820xxx  and
suxamethonium) .
effecters added after 5 min of aging

if the quatemary ammonium compounds were
added 5 min after the start of aging without hi 6,
the ache activity was slightly increased in comparison to control experiments (fig. 3a). this effect
depended on the effector concentration
and was
significantly different (p < 0.01) from control values
for suxamethonium (at 810 pm) and hexamethonium
(830 pm, 8.3 mm). no significant effect was found
with tma and  xxxd1820xxx .
the reactivation
obtained by hi 6 could not be further augmented by
any of these compounds (fig. 3b).
discussion
the data presented
demonstrate that quatemary
ammonium
compounds
can increase the reactivatability by hi 6 of soman-inhibited human ache
in vitro at nearly physiological temperature and ph
(fig. 2a-d and fig. 3a,b). all drugs investigated
were inhibitors of the ache (table 2). their respective dissociation constants, however, varied considerably, in agreement with the results of previous
investigations [17,21-231.

the affinities to both the active and an allosteric
binding site of the ache were about two orders of
magnitude lower for tma and hexamethonium than
for suxamethonium and  xxxd1820xxx  (table 2).
in addition, the type of inhibition was not uniform
for all quaternary compounds. according to the
literature [l&22], the kinetic analysis revealed a
mixed, competitive and non-competitive type of inhibition for tma,  xxxd1820xxx 
and suxamethonium (fig. 1 and table 2). the kii/ki ratios of
these three compounds were quite similar (3.5-5.1)
and relatively low compared to hexamethonium
(13.6). as suggested by schuh [23] and liillmann et
al. [17], the affinity of hexamethonium
to the active
site is probably much higher than to any allosteric
site, and it can therefore be considered a competitive
inhibitor in contrast to the other quaternary ligands
investigated in this study.
moreover, the affinity to the allosteric site (kii) of
these compounds appeared to be a reliable indicator
of the effective concentration,
because quaternary
compounds with a low affinity (tma, hexamethonium; see table 2) exhibited their protective
effect on ache at much higher concentrations than
those with a relatively high affinity ( xxxd1820xxx ,
suxamethonium).
in contrast, almost no effect was
observed at ki concentrations. the correlation of the
kii values and the effective concentrations
supports
the hypothesis [lo] that a peripheral modulatory site
might be involved in the protective action of these
quatemary ammonium ligands.
all four compounds augmented the reactivatability by hi 6 of soman-inhibited human erythrocyte
ache when added at the start of aging. however,
considerable differences between the quaternary
ammonium
compounds could be observed with
respect to the shape of the concentration-effect
curves of these drugs and their efficacy.  xxxd1820xxx  was the only compound to exhibit a bellshaped concentration-effect
curve with a maximum
at 154pm. at higher concentrations,
its beneficial
effect decreased (770pm) or even disappeared
(1.5 mm). the other three compounds (tma, hexamethonium, suxamethonium) showed a steady concentration-dependent
increase of efficacy in the
range investigated,
even if we used higher concentrations than with  xxxd1820xxx .
the comparison of the ability of the four quaternary ammonium compounds to improve the reactivatability
of soman-inhibited
ache revealed
further important differences.  xxxd1820xxx  and
suxamethonium
showed higher effects (+40 and

+35.8%) at lower concentrations
(150 pm and
1.6 mm) than hexamethonium and tma (+ 19.2 and
+22.5%; 8.3 and 22mm). these findings partially
correspond to a recently published study of berman
and decker [13] who found the highest efficacy
for
 xxxd1820xxx 
in retarding
aging
of
methylphosphono-ache.
according to the literature [9-14,16,17]
two
mechanisms of action might be responsible for the
beneficial
effect of mono- or bisquarternary
ammonium compounds on soman-inhibited ache:
(1) the prevention of enzyme phosphonylation
and
(2) the reduction of the dealkylation rate of the
phosphonylated enzyme. a direct reactivation of the
phosphonylated enzyme by these compounds is not
probable because of the absence of an oxime group

[24]. on the base of the results presented, both
mechanisms are possible. the first mechanism would
explain, why these compounds,
especially hexamethonium
and suxamethonium,
increased the
activity of ache incubated with soman when added
alone after a 5-min aging period. at that time, the
ache was not completely inhibited (residual activity
6-12%, see methods); the quaternary compounds
probably prevented the phosphonylation
of the
remaining, uninhibited active sites. this is in good
agreement with previous studies using dfp-inhibited
ache [16,17].
however, there was indirect evidence that this is
not the only mechanism of action of quaternary
ammonium
compounds
upon
soman-inhibited
ache. especially  xxxd1820xxx  is likely to retard

reactivatability

of soman-inhibited

the dealkylation reaction (aging) of soman-inhibited
ache, as suggested by berman and decker [13]
for methylphosphono-ache.
our data support this
hypothesis, as  xxxd1820xxx 
exerted the highest
effect of all compounds investigated on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited
ache by hi 6 (fig.
2d), but the smallest effect when added alone (fig.
3a). thus,  xxxd1820xxx  might rather retard aging
than prevent the phosphonylation
of ache by
soman, in contrast to the other three drugs investigated which seem to slow the phosphonylation of
ache at a relatively higher degree.
our data do certainly not allow exhaustive considerations
on structure-activity
relationships.
further polymethonium compounds should be investigated. however, our data are in agreement with
the assumption of berman and decker [13] that
bisquatemary polymethonium compounds are more
effective in increasing the reactivatability than monoquaternary compounds as shown for tma in this
and for decyltrimethylammonium
and
study
hexyltrimethylammonium
by the forementioned
authors [13]. additionally, an interquarternarychain
length of 10 methylene groups ( xxxd1820xxx )
might result in a higher efficacy than of 6 groups
the
same
inter(hexamethonium)
. perhaps
quaternary distance of 1.45 nm which is believed to
be partially responsible for the depolarising activity
of  xxxd1820xxx  and suxamethonium [25] is optimal to improve the reactivatability.
in conclusion, both the prevention of phosphonylation and the decrease of dealkylation of the
phosphonylated ache may contribute to the beneficial action of mono- or bisquaternary compounds
on soman-inhibited
enzyme. the majority of publications dealing with aging of organophosphateinhibited ache neglects the prevention of phosphylation [9,13,15]. as shown by this work and by
previous investigations [16, 171, this effect might well
contribute to an increased reactivatability and should
therefore be considered in further studies.
concerning the practical therapeutic aspects of
soman-poisoning,
the mechanism of the beneficial
effects becomes less important, because both prevention of phosphonylation and retardation of aging
are rather of prophylactic than of therapeutic interest. as shown by ohnesorge [16] with dfp, these
ammonium compounds might also exert protective
effects in uiuo. the toxicity of all compounds investigated in this study is certainly too high to take them
into consideration
for routine antidotal administration in agreement with crone [14] and gray et
al. [12] we therefore stress the need for less toxic
agents.
