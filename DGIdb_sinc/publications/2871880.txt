the rat isolated right atrium (frequency response) and progesterone-treated rat uterus (relaxation)
used to examine the p1- and p2-adrenoceptor stimulatory effects of  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  and
 xxxd2957xxx . in addition, the fl-adrenoceptor stimulatory effect of  xxxd2991xxx  was studied in the right
atrium.
2 all the compounds studied caused a concentration-dependent increase in atrial frequency and
relaxation of the uterus. the atrial response to  xxxd2957xxx  was competitively inhibited by the pl-selective
blocker pafenolol (10-7m), while the l2-selective blocker ici 118551 (10-sm) was without effect.
pafenolol (10- m) was also shown to inhibit the atrial frequency effect ofalprenolol and  xxxd2812xxx . in
the uterus, ici 118551 (3 x 10-9 m, 3 10-8 m, 3 x 10-7 m) blocked the  xxxd2957xxx  effect with a pkb of
9.28. in addition, ici 118551 (10-8 m) competitively inhibited the relaxation of the uterus induced by
 xxxd123xxx  and  xxxd2812xxx .
3 for  xxxd123xxx  (right atrium and uterus),  xxxd2812xxx  (right atrium), and  xxxd2957xxx  (right atrium), the
concentrations needed for half-maximal response were significantly greater than those required for
occupation of half the receptors. this dissociation was most pronounced for  xxxd2957xxx  in the right
atrium. in this tissue, 80-85% of the pl-adrenoceptors had to be occupied by  xxxd2957xxx  to initiate a
tissue response corresponding to 50% of the maximal effect generated by the compound.
4 the intrinsic activities of  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx  (expressed as % ofthe maximal tissue
response to  xxxd2398xxx ) were significantly higher in the uterus than in the right atrium. the intrinsic
activity of the compounds varied between individual preparations and, particularly in the uterus,
correlated with the sensitivity of the tissue to f-adrenoceptor stimulation by  xxxd2398xxx .
5 calculation of efficacy, relative to  xxxd2398xxx , ofthe partial p-agonists revealed a p2-adrenoceptor
selectivity for  xxxd123xxx  (2.0),  xxxd2812xxx  (1.4) and  xxxd2957xxx  (3.0).
6 it is concluded that weak partial agonists such as  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx  possess
complex  xxxg2051xxx - and p2-adrenoceptor stimulatory properties in relation to p-adrenoceptor occupancy and
tissue sensitivity to p-adrenoceptor stimulation.

introduction
several p-adrenoceptor blockers possess intrinsic
activity, i.e. they are partial agonists. earlier studies
suggested that their action may be complex. thus,
kaumann & blinks (1980) reported a dissociation
between p-adrenoceptor occupation and p-adrenoceptor activation for a number of partial p-agonists, the
concentrations required for activation being greater
than those required for occupation. a positive correlation was found between the maximal tissue response
obtained with a partial p-agonist and the sensitivity of
the tissue to p-adrenoceptor stimulation by isopren-

aline (kenakin & beek, 1980; 1984; mattsson et al.,
1983). this suggests that tissue-related factors, such as
receptor density and the efficiency of receptor coupling, strongly influence the tissue response generated
by a partial agonist (kenakin, 1984). furthermore, it
has been proposed that some weak partial p-agonists,
e.g.  xxxd2957xxx  are more active on p2- than on p1adrenoceptors (clark, 1984).
the purpose of this study was to investigate the pfand p2-adrenoceptor stimulatory effects of the partial
p-agonists  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx . in

addition, the ,i-adrenoceptor stimulatory effect of
 xxxd2991xxx  was examined. special attention was paid to
comparing the stimulatory and blocking concentrations of the compounds on pi- and p2-adrenoceptors,
calculating relative efficacy of the compounds, and
relating the stimulatory effect of the partial agonist to
the tissue sensitivity to  xxxd2398xxx .
methods

uteri were obtained from sprague-dawley rats
(200-300g) treated with progesterone (10mgkg-'
day' i.m.) for 6 days. uteri taken from rats treated
with progesterone are known to contain a 100% p2adrenoceptor population (nahorski, 1981). the right
atrium was isolated from male sprague-dawley rats
(230-350 g). all rats were treated with reserpine
(2 mg kg-' i.p.) 16-20 h before the experiment. this
was done in order to avoid release of endogenous
noradrenaline caused by phenoxybenzamine and, in
the uterus experiments, by high potassium. the
animals were killed by a blow to the neck.
isolated uterus
the uterine horn was cut longitudinally to obtain one
or, in some experiments, two strips. the strip was
mounted in an organ bath (volume 50 ml) with one end
fixed and the other end sutured to a force displacement transducer (grass model ft03). the experiments were carried out at 37°c in an aerated (97%
02, 3% co2) buffer (ph 7.4) composition
a

(mm): nacl 122, kcl4.7, caci22.5, mgcl2 1.2,
nahco3 15.5, kh2po4 1.2, disodium calcium edta
0.5, and glucose 1 1.5. the preparation was stretched to
a baseline tension of 0.5 g. the approximate length of
the strips was 15 mm and the width - 2 mm. to block
neuronal and extraneuronal uptake and ct-adrenoceptors, the preparation was incubated with phenoxybenzamine (10-6 m) for 30 min (furchgott, 1966). after
repeated washing the uterus was contracted by a high
potassium buffer. the potassium concentration was
increased to 60 mm by substituting kci for equimolar
amounts of naci.
isolated right atrium
the hearts were rapidly removed and washed in buffer
(for composition, see above), equilibrated with 97%
02 and 3% co2. a strip including the sinus node was
prepared from the right atrium and mounted for
recording of (isometric) contraction. the atrial strip
was pre-stretched to a baseline tension of 0.4 g (length
15mm and width 1-2mm). the frequency of
contraction was measured on a separate channel by a
cardiotachometer (grass model 7p4f). the experiments were performed at 37c. the preparation
was incubated with phenoxybenzamine as described
above.

concentration-response curves and calculations
in order to establish the sensitivity to 0-adrenoceptor
stimulation, a concentration-response curve to
 xxxd2398xxx  was constructed for each tissue. starting

curve iso, and subsequent washing,  xxxd2957xxx  was added in increments of i log unit until the maximal effect was
established. a second  xxxd2398xxx  concentration-response curve iso2 was then constructed with the final concentration
of  xxxd2957xxx  still present in the organ bath.

1- and p2-stimulatory effects of partial p-agonists

with 10-11 m,  xxxd2398xxx  was added in increments of
0.5 log units. for each concentration, the tissue
response was followed until it was steady. after
recording the  xxxd2398xxx  concentration-response
curve the preparation was washed and allowed to
stabilize for 90min before the next concentrationresponse curve was started. this involved administration of one of the following partial agonists:  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx ,  xxxd2991xxx  or  xxxd2957xxx . for these
compounds, the concentration-response curve was
started at 1io m and continued in increments of i log
unit. for each concentration ofthe partial agonist, the
tissue response was measured until it had reached
equilibrium (within 10-15 min). after the maximal
effect of the partial agonist had been established, a
second  xxxd2398xxx  concentration-response curve was
constructed, with the final concentration of the partial
agonist still present in the bath (10- 6 or 0-5 m, figure
1).
it has been suggested that very long incubation
periods are required for a partial agonist like  xxxd2957xxx 
to obtain a steady-state tissue response (kaumann &
blinks, 1980; walter et al., 1984). this was examined
in strips of rat uterus and right atrium incubated in
various  xxxd2957xxx  concentrations for 30-45 min. in
these experiments, the maximal response to each
concentration was always obtained within the first
10-15 min. differences in temperature (370c in this
study) and the thickness of the preparations used may
explain the discrepancy between our findings and the
earlier observations by kaumann and coworkers.
the concentration-response curves for the agonists
were determined by applying the experimental points
to a hyperbolic function by the method ofleast squares
fit, using a procedure modified from that described by
parker & waud (1971). for each concentration-response curve, the negative log of the agonist concentration which elicited 50% of the maximal effect was
determined (- log ec50 = pd2). the intrinsic activity
of the partial agonist was expressed as percentage of
the maximal response produced in the tissue by
 xxxd2398xxx . the p-adrenoceptor antagonistic
potency ofthe partial agonist was determined from the
shift in the concentration-response curve to  xxxd2398xxx  (figure 1). the negative logarithm of the equilibrium dissociation constant (pkb) for the partial
agonist was calculated according to kaumann &
blinks (1980).
in some experiments, the tissue was incubated
(30min) with the pi-selective antagonist pafenolol
(mattsson et al., 1982; ek & nahorski, 1986) or the 2selective antagonist ici 118551 ( xxxd2033xxx -dl-1 (7methylindan- 7- yloxy) -3- isopropylaminobutan-2-ol)
bilski et al., 1983) before recording the concentrationresponse curve for the partial agonist. for the uterus
experiments, two strips were taken from each rat. the
antagonist was added to one of the strips and the

659

concentration-response curve for the action of the
partial agonist on this strip was compared to that of
the parallel, control, strip. the pa2 for ici 118551 was
calculated from the shifts in the concentration-response curves for  xxxd2957xxx  (arunlakshana & schild,
1959). since the slope was not significantly different
from - i (figure 2), the best-fit line of slope = - 1
was determined to obtain the - log equilibrium
dissociation constant (pkb). in the experiments with
only one concentration ofpafenolol or ici 118551, the
pkb for the antagonist (b) was calculated from the
equation: pkb=log (dose-ratio - 1) - log conc. b.
relative efficacy
the efficacy, relative to  xxxd2398xxx , was calculated
for  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx ,  xxxd2957xxx  and  xxxd2991xxx .
using the concepts and terms introduced by stephenson (1956), the tissue response (r) was regarded as a
function of the stimulus (s) given to the tissue by the
agonist, r = f(s). the stimulus (s) is the product of
the fractional receptor occupancy (y) of an agonist and
its efficacy (e), s = e x y. the assumption was then
made that, for a partial agonist (pa) and  xxxd2398xxx 
(iso), equal responses in the same tissue corresponded
to equal stimuli, epa x ypa = e1so x y1so. thus, the
efficacy ofthe partial p-agonist relative to  xxxd2398xxx 
(epa/elso) is obtained from the relative receptor

a slope =-i (shown in the figure) gives an equilibrium
dissociation constant (pkb) of 9.28 ± 0.22 (mean ± s.d.)

occupancies of the two compounds (yiso/ypa) required
to produce an equal tissue response (furchgott, 1966;
furchgott & bursztyn, 1967).
in the present study, the tissue responses generated
by the partial p-agonists were, in many cases, rather
small. thus, the efficacies of the compounds, relative
to  xxxd2398xxx , were obtained from ratios of receptor
occupancies (yij0/ypa) calculated at only one set of
equi-active concentrations, corresponding to 50% of
the maximal response of the partial agonist. the
receptor occupancy (y) was calculated from the equation; y = a/(a + ka) where a is the concentration of
agonist which elicits the response and ka is the
equilibrium dissociation constant. the dissociation
constant for  xxxd2398xxx  on pj- and p2-adrenoceptors
(3 x 10-7m) was obtained from previous p-adrenoceptor binding studies (kaumann, 1978; hedberg &
mattsson, 1981; brodde et al., 1983). for the partial pagonist, the equilibrium dissociation constant was
obtained from the shift in the concentration-response
curve for  xxxd2398xxx  (see above). the mean value for
the dissociation constant (table 3) was used to
calculate the receptor occupancy (y). the relative
efficacy was calculated as - log (epa/ei:,) since a
logarithmic transformation stabilizes the variance and
normalizes the distribution of this variable.

tolol caused a concentration-dependent increase in the
frequency of the rat isolated right atrium. pafenolol
(10-7 m) inhibited the  xxxd2957xxx  effect while ici 118551
(108 m) was without effect (table 1). a pkb of 7.8 for
pafenolol was calculated from the shift in the  xxxd2957xxx 
concentration-response curve. this is in agreement
with the p1-adrenoceptor affinity of pafenolol found
previously (ek & nahorski, 1986). ,1-adrenoceptor
blockade with pafenolol (10-7 m) also shifted the
concentration-response curves to the right for  xxxd2812xxx : the pd2 ( xxxd2812xxx ) decreased from 8.54 ± 0.52
(n = 20, controls) to 7.66 ± 0.24 (n = 10, with pafenolol), p < 0.01. a similar effect of pafenolol (10-7 m)
was also found in experiments with  xxxd123xxx , in
which the pd2 ( xxxd123xxx ) decreased from 8.42 ± 0.33
(n = 17, controls) to 7.39 ± 0.51 (n = 4, with pafenolol), p<0.05.

 xxxd2957xxx  (figure 1),  xxxd123xxx  and  xxxd2812xxx  caused
a concentration-dependent relaxation of the rat
isolated uterus. the effect of  xxxd2957xxx  was competitively inhibited by ici 118551 (figure 2). the pkb
(9.28) obtained from the schild plot is in agreement
with the previously reported p2-adrenoceptor affinity
of ici 118551 (brodde et al., 1983). the effects of
 xxxd2812xxx  and  xxxd123xxx  on the uterus were also
found to be inhibited by the p2-selective blocker
ici 118551 (table 2).
correlation between f,-adrenoceptor activation andfiadrenoceptor occupation ofthe partial agonists

the concentrations needed for half-maximal response
(pd2) were significantly greater than those required
for the occupation of half the receptors (pkb) for
 xxxd123xxx  (right atrium and uterus),  xxxd2812xxx  (right
atrium) and  xxxd2957xxx  (right atrium) (table 3). for
 xxxd2957xxx , this difference between pd2 and pkb was

significantly greater (p <0.001) in the right atrium
compared to that in the uterus.
in the right atrium, the fraction of p-adrenoceptors
occupied by the partial agonists at the pd2 concentrations were:  xxxd123xxx  62 ± 20%,  xxxd2812xxx 
63 ± 20%,  xxxd2957xxx  81 ± 16% and  xxxd2991xxx 
44 ± 26% (mean values ± s.d.). the corresponding
values in the uterus were:  xxxd123xxx  61 ± 12%,
 xxxd2812xxx  61 ± 19% and  xxxd2957xxx  53 ± 13% (mean
values ± s.d.). for  xxxd2957xxx , the fractional receptor
occupancy was significantly higher (p <0.001) in the
right atrium than in the uterus at the pd2 concentration. in the right atrium, the p-adrenoceptor
occupancy at the  xxxd2957xxx  concentration causing 20%
of its maximal effect was 45 ± 24% (mean
value ± s.d.). in the uterus, the corresponding p-adrenoceptor occupancy of  xxxd2957xxx  was 28 ± 13%.

compounds studied (table 4). in the uterus, the
intrinsic activity of  xxxd2957xxx  varied between individual
preparations from 0 to 79% (figure 3). a similar
variation was also found for  xxxd2812xxx  (0 to 48%)
and  xxxd123xxx  (14 to 61%, figure 4). a high correlation between the intrinsic activity ofthe partial agonist

tion (mattson et al., 1982; o'donnell & wanstall,
1985) whereas the relaxation of the rat uterus is due to
2-adrenoceptor stimulation (nahorski, 1981; kenakin, 1982; mattson et al., 1982). these earlier
observations in the rat were confirmed in this study,
using the pi-selective blocker pafenolol (mattsson et
al., 1982; ek & nahorski, 1986) and the p2-selective
blocker ici 118551 (bilski et al., 1983).
a marked dissociation between p-adrenoceptor
activation and p-adrenoceptor occupation was
observed for  xxxd2957xxx  in the right atrium in the present
study. in contrast, there was no dissociation between
activation and occupation for  xxxd2957xxx  in the uterus.
these observations thus suggest that, for  xxxd2957xxx , the
dissociation between p-adrenoceptor activation and
occupation only applies to the action of the compound
on the ,i-adrenoceptors. in the right atrium, 45 and
85% ofthe p-adrenoceptors were occupied by  xxxd2957xxx 
at the concentrations producing 20 and 50% of its
maximal stimulatory effect, respectively. thus a receptor occupancy of  xxxd2957xxx  below 30-40% seems
insufficient to initiate a tissue response such as atrial
frequency increase.
kaumann and coworkers reported a dissociation of
f-adrenoceptor occupation and p-adrenoceptor
activation for both the racemic (kaumann & blinks,
1980) and the active s-form of  xxxd2957xxx  (walter et al.,
1984). for the s-form of  xxxd2957xxx , this dissociation
was found both for relaxation ofthe guinea-pig isolated
trachea and for the frequency stimulation of the
guinea-pig isolated right atrium. in these studies, the
concentration-response curves for both s- xxxd2957xxx

and racemic  xxxd2957xxx  (cat atrial frequency response)
were biphasic and spread over at least 4 log units
(walter et al., 1984; kaumann & blinks, 1980). this is
in contrast to the concentration-response curves for
 xxxd2957xxx  obtained in the rat right atrium and uterus
(figure 1). the reason for the discrepancies between
the observations by kaumann and coworkers and the
present study is not clear but one important difference
may be that the a-mediated frequency increase in cat
(carlsson et al., 1972) and guinea-pig atria (johansson
& persson, 1983) and relaxation of guinea-pig trachea
(o'donnell & wanstall, 1979) are tissue responses
which are all mediated by both ai- and p2-adrenoceptors. in the uterus of the progesterone-treated rat, and
in the rat right atrium, however, pure 0,- and p2adrenoceptor-mediated responses are obtained.
both in vivo and in vitro  xxxd2957xxx  has displayed 02adrenoceptor agonistic selectivity (clark, 1984), although there is some controversy (mian & malta, 1985).
in this study, the calculation of relative efficacy of the
partial p-agonists demonstrates that  xxxd2957xxx , as well
as  xxxd123xxx  and  xxxd2812xxx , do possess p2-selectivity
as partial agonists. a p2-adrenoceptor selectivity in
efficacy is also indicated from the greater intrinsic
activity of these compounds obtained in the uterus
when compared to that observed in the right atrium. in
fact, there was a good correlation (r = 0.98) between
the intrinsic activity of  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  and
 xxxd2957xxx  (mean values, table 4) and the estimated
relative efficacy of these compounds on ab- and p2adrenoceptors.
rat right atrium and uterus were found to be
equally sensitive to p-adrenoceptor stimulation by
 xxxd2398xxx . in both organs, however, the sensitivity
to  xxxd2398xxx  varied between individual tissues,
probably reflecting an individual variation in the
efficiency of receptor coupling to the response (mattsson et al., 1983; kenakin, 1984). in the uterus there
was a high correlation between the intrinsic activity of
the partial agonist and the sensitivity of the tissue to
 xxxd2398xxx  stimulation. this observation indicates
that the level of intrinsic activity of a weak partial
agonist depends on the efficiency of the receptor
coupling to the final tissue response studied (mattsson
et al., 1983; kenakin & beek, 1984). the correlation
between the intrinsic activity of the partial p-agonist
and the tissue sensitivity to  xxxd2398xxx  stimulation in
the right atrium was weaker than in the uterus. it is
possible that this relation weakens at a low efficacy as
is the case for  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx  on
the pi-adrenoceptors in the rat right atrium.
