abstract: in january 2006 the food and drug administration
approved  xxxd2513xxx  for the treatment of chronic constipation
in men and women aged 18 and over.  xxxd2513xxx  is
categorized as a prostone, a bicyclic fatty acid metabolite of
 xxxd124xxx .  xxxd2513xxx  activates a speciÔ¨Åc chloride
channel ( xxxg472xxx ) in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract to enhance
intestinal Ô¨Çuid secretion, which increases gi transit and
improves symptoms of constipation. this article reviews the
role of chloride channels in the gi tract, describes the structure,
function, and pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2513xxx , and discusses
clinically important data on this new medication.

astrointestinal (gi) motility in healthy patients is a
subconscious, asymptomatic event that represents
the culmination of multiple concurrent physiologic
processes. these processes require the presence of an
intact nervous system (enteric, autonomic, and central),
normally functioning smooth muscle, the synthesis and
release of various neurotransmitters and hormones, and
appropriate intestinal secretion.1 abnormalities in any of
these distinct and varied physiologic processes can
produce a variety of symptoms clinically deÔ¨Åned as
constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), gastroparesis, dyspepsia, and functional abdominal pain. treatment options for these syndromes generally focus on
modulating speciÔ¨Åc neurotransmitters and/or receptors in
either the enteric or the central nervous systems. as an
example, alosetron and  xxxd3302xxx  target the serotonin
system in patients with ibs,2,3 whereas  xxxd1927xxx 
targets dopamine receptors for the treatment of dyspepsia
and gastroparesis.4 although these therapeutic options
improve symptoms in many patients, they are not
uniformly eÔ¨Äective in all patients. because normal gi

tract motility reÔ¨Çects a myriad of physiologic processes,
other therapies have been explored for the treatment of
gi motility disorders.5 as an example, increased intestinal Ô¨Çuid secretion into the lumen of the gi tract could
stimulate gut motility and improve gi transit.  xxxd2513xxx , a selective chloride channel activator, was developed
with this concept in mind.
this manuscript provides an overview of chloride
channels, reviews the structure and function of  xxxd2513xxx , summarizes preclinical data, and analyzes the
available clinical data supporting a role for  xxxd2513xxx 
in the treatment of chronic constipation. lastly, other
potential uses of  xxxd2513xxx  are discussed.

the role of chloride channels
chloride channels are pore-forming proteins that
allow the transport of chloride ions, the predominant
anion in the extracellular Ô¨Çuid, across cell membranes.
found in virtually all cell types, they play a vital role in
the function of epithelial, muscle, and nerve cells. one of
the most important chloride channels in the gi tract is the
cystic Ô¨Åbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(cftr). this  xxxd1773xxx -regulated channel is located
on the apical membrane, is normally activated by protein
kinase a, and is defective in patients with cystic Ô¨Åbrosis.6
chloride channels are implicated in a variety of diseases
including epilepsy, dystrophia myotonica, bartter syndrome, osteoporosis, and chronic pancreatitis.7
chloride channels can be categorized in several
diÔ¨Äerent ways, including function, gating mechanisms,
molecular structure, pharmacologic characteristics, and
electrophysiologic properties.8,9 functionally, chloride
channels help maintain the resting membrane potential
of skeletal muscle, assist with depolarization of smooth
muscle cells, regulate postsynaptic transmission, maintain
intracellular ph, and modulate cell volume and Ô¨Çuid
transport.10 the last 3 functions are especially critical to
normal gi tract epithelial cell function. chloride channel
opening occurs secondary to changes in the membrane
electric potential (voltage-dependent chloride channels,
such as clc), calcium Ô¨Çux (calcium-activated channels),
activation of protein kinase (ie, the cftr channel), or
binding of glycine or gaba (ligand gated). chloride
channels can also be categorized by their molecular
structure. for example, clc are 2 pore channels; in
contrast, the cftr channel consists of 1 pore.7 finally,
chloride channels can also be deÔ¨Åned by their biophysical

properties (i.e., measuring conductance, current-voltage
relationship, etc.). although there are 9 separate clc
channels (clc-0‚Äìclc-7,  xxxg473xxx , clc-kb), this review
will focus on the  xxxg472xxx  channel, because  xxxd2513xxx 
selectively activates this type of chloride channel.
the  xxxg472xxx  channel is an a-helical transmembrane
protein that has 10 to 12 intramembrane portions.11 it is
highly selective for cl ; it is not permeable to larger
anions or to cations. the  xxxg472xxx  channel is distributed
throughout the body including the gi tract (stomach,
small intestine, colon) and has several essential functions
including maintaining the membrane potential of the cell,
regulating ph and cell volume, and participating in cl
transport and Ô¨Çuid secretion.12‚Äì18  xxxg472xxx  channels are
localized to the apical cell membrane (fig. 1) in human
intestine13 and in a cultured human gi epithelial cell line
(t84).19 however, the location of the  xxxg472xxx  channel may
diÔ¨Äer in other species.20,21 as discussed below,  xxxd2513xxx  acts locally to directly activate  xxxg472xxx  channels.

structure, pharmacokinetics,
metabolism, and mechanism of action
structure
 xxxd2513xxx  is classiÔ¨Åed as a prostone, a bicyclic
fatty acid compound derived from a metabolite of
 xxxd124xxx .  xxxd2513xxx  can tautomerize between
2 diÔ¨Äerent forms-ii is the active form (fig. 2). in
preclinical studies,  xxxd2513xxx  was identiÔ¨Åed as  xxxd2513xxx  and  xxxd2513xxx .22 it is a white, odorless crystal and
powder that is insoluble in water but soluble in ethanol.

pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetic proÔ¨Åle of  xxxd2513xxx  was
evaluated by giving 5 diÔ¨Äerent species of animals a single
oral dose of radio-labeled (3-h)  xxxd2513xxx  (table 1).23
the plasma half-life (t1/2) was less than 9 hours in all

346

species. radioactivity was found primarily in the gi tract
with small amounts initially found within the liver. by 48
hours, 73% to 95% of radioactivity had been excreted
from all animals, and the predominant route of elimination was urine in all species.
in human studies using the recommended dose of
24 mg b.i.d., plasma levels of intact  xxxd2513xxx  are below
standard levels of quantitation. (10 pg/ml).22 the parent
molecule cannot be detected in plasma, urine, or stool.
this exceedingly low amount of systemic absorption
makes it diÔ¨Écult to calculate an accurate peak absorption
and t1/2. human pharmacokinetics were addressed in
a separate, unpublished study of fasted healthy male
volunteers.22 after a single 72 mg oral dose of radiolabeled  xxxd2513xxx , 60% of radioactivity was recovered
in the urine within 24 hours, and 63% was recovered in
the urine by the end of 1 week. thirty percent of the total
administered radioactivity was recovered in the stool by 1
week. the measured radioactivity likely represents an
active metabolite, rather than the intact parent compound. using a radio-labeled compound it is estimated
that the t1/2 of  xxxd2513xxx  is approximately 3 hours.

metabolism
the metabolism of  xxxd2513xxx  takes place within
the lumen of the gi tract. metabolism occurs via
microsomal carbonyl reductase rather than the cytochrome p450 system. several steps are involved in the
breakdown of  xxxd2513xxx , including reduction of the
carbonyl group at the 15 position, followed by a-chain
b-oxidation, and then oxidation of the o chain.22 this
pathway, combined with minimal systemic absorption,
should minimize potential drug-drug interactions.

animal studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2513xxx  is metabolized rapidly and locally within the gi
tract.24 metabolism was evaluated in 4 separate animal
species using radio-labeled (3-h)  xxxd2513xxx . only
minimal amounts of intact radio-labeled  xxxd2513xxx 
were identiÔ¨Åed at any time point during the studies, and
there was none detected within the urine or feces of any
animal.
in humans, the main metabolite of  xxxd2513xxx 
(which is designated m3) is thought to be active on the
apical surface of the epithelial cell. in contrast to
the parent drug, m3 is absorbed and can be measured
in the plasma. approximately 94% of m3 is bound to
human plasma proteins. peak plasma levels occur
approximately 1.14 hours after oral administration of a
single 24 mg dose.22 the half-life of m3 is approximately
0.9 to 1.4 hours. approximately 30% of the metabolite is
excreted in the urine, whereas the remainder is excreted in
the stool. sex does not seem to inÔ¨Çuence the metabolism
of  xxxd2513xxx . no studies have been conducted to assess
the pharmacokinetic proÔ¨Åle of  xxxd2513xxx  in patients
with hepatic or renal impairment.
in summary, these data show that after oral
ingestion,  xxxd2513xxx  seems to act locally within the
gi tract to activate  xxxg472xxx  channels. it is rapidly
metabolized, and the active form of  xxxd2513xxx  has very
low systemic bioavailability after oral administration.

mechanism of action
 xxxd2513xxx  activates  xxxg472xxx  channels on the apical
membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. although the
complete mechanism explaining  xxxd2513xxx ‚Äôs eÔ¨Écacy is
not completely understood at this time, the primary
action is mediated via these channels. when activated,
there is an eÔ¨Ñux of chloride through the channels into the
lumen of the intestinal tract. to maintain electrical
neutrality, sodium ions follow through a paracellular
pathway. water then follows, also along the paracellular
pathway, to maintain isotonic equilibrium (fig. 3).
opening chloride channels thus causes a net eÔ¨Ñux of

 xxxd2513xxx 

chloride into the lumen of the intestinal tract which
promotes intestinal Ô¨Çuid secretion. secretion of Ô¨Çuids into
the gi tract adds Ô¨Çuid to stool and promotes increased
transit, likely through stimulation of local receptors
sensitive to stretch and distention.25,26
although the small intestine and colon are able to
avidly absorb secreted Ô¨Çuid, the activation of  xxxg472xxx 
channels throughout both the small intestine and colon
likely leads to its net stimulatory eÔ¨Äects.  xxxd2513xxx  is
speciÔ¨Åc for  xxxg472xxx  channels and does not activate other
chloride channels such as cftr. activation of  xxxg472xxx 
channels by  xxxd2513xxx  is independent of protein kinase
a. highly speciÔ¨Åc inhibitors of  xxxg472xxx  channels are not
currently available.
the location and speciÔ¨Åcity of  xxxd2513xxx  for  xxxg472xxx  channels were demonstrated in a set of 3 experiments
conducted by cuppoletti and colleagues.19 to demonstrate the location of the  xxxg472xxx  channels, a human colonic
epithelial cell line was grown to conÔ¨Çuence in culture.
the cultures were then Ô¨Åxed, permeabilized, stained with
an anti- xxxg472xxx  antibody, and labeled with an immunoÔ¨Çuorescent antibody. immunoconfocal microscopy, using
appropriate blocking agents and controls, demonstrated
that  xxxg472xxx  channels were localized to the apical cell
membrane, and not to the basolateral areas. in the same
study, cuppoletti and colleagues measured short circuit
current as an indicator of chloride movement. exposure
to  xxxd2513xxx  ( xxxd2513xxx ), but not vehicle, increased
short circuit current Ô¨Çow, indicating increased eÔ¨Ñux
of chloride. finally, the speciÔ¨Åcity of  xxxd2513xxx  for
 xxxg472xxx  channels was demonstrated using whole cell
patch clamp studies in a human embryonic cell line
transfected with  xxxg472xxx  or cftr. this experiment
demonstrated that  xxxd2513xxx  activates chloride
currents in  xxxg472xxx  transfected cells in a dose-dependent
manner, but it did not increase cl conductance in
cftr transfected cells.
animal studies have further assessed the role of
 xxxd2513xxx  on chloride and water secretion into the
lumen of the gi tract.27 after administration of oral

clinical studies
the eÔ¨Écacy of  xxxd2513xxx  for the treatment of
constipation has been studied in 1 dose ranging study,
2 separate phase 3 trials, a withdrawal study, and several
larger open-label studies.
the Ô¨Årst published study involved a randomized
dose-ranging study of  xxxd2513xxx  in 127 subjects with
chronic (at least 6 mo) constipation.28 constipation was
deÔ¨Åned as fewer than 3 spontaneous bowel movements
(sbm) per week, together with one or more of the
following symptoms that occurred 25% of the time: hard
stools, straining, or feelings of incomplete evacuation.
the subjects received either  xxxd2513xxx  (24, 48, or 72 mg
per day) or placebo for 3 consecutive weeks after a 2-week
washout period. the subjects‚Äô age and sex were not
reported. the intention to treat analysis showed a
signiÔ¨Åcant increase in the average number of weekly
sbm. these beneÔ¨Åcial eÔ¨Äects occurred at the 48 and 72 mg
doses and began during the Ô¨Årst 2 weeks of the study
period. signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in stool consistency,
bloating, and the global assessment of the severity of
constipation were also observed. adverse eÔ¨Äects, which
included headaches, diarrhea, and bloating, occurred
equally between the placebo and treatment groups.
although the overall rates were not reported, nausea
was more common in the  xxxd2513xxx  group, occurring
in a dose-dependent fashion. the 4 subjects who withdrew due to nausea were distributed equally among the
treatment groups.
these preliminary results were conÔ¨Årmed in 2
similar phase 3 multicenter trials.29,30 inclusion criteria
required that patients have at least 6 months of
constipation, as deÔ¨Åned in the original johanson et al28
study. one trial involved 242 subjects (mean age = 48.6 y;
90% women; 86% white), whereas the other had 237
subjects (mean age = 45.8 y; 88% women). both trials
randomized subjects after a 2-week baseline period to
either 24 mg of  xxxd2513xxx  twice daily for 4 weeks or
placebo. compared with placebo, the treatment groups in
both studies experienced signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in the
frequency of weekly bowel movements (5.1 to 5.7 vs. 2.8
to 3.5, p<0.002; and 5.89 vs. 3.99, p<0.0001). similar
to the initial dose ranging study, improvements in
straining, stool consistency, and a global assessment of
treatment eÔ¨Äectiveness, were also observed. a rapid onset
of beneÔ¨Åcial eÔ¨Äects were seen in a signiÔ¨Åcantly larger
percentage of subjects treated with  xxxd2513xxx . bowel
movements occurred within 24 hours of the Ô¨Årst dose
compared with placebo (57% vs. 37% in the Ô¨Årst study,
p = 0.0024; and 61% vs. 31% in the second study,
p<0.0001). in both trials these eÔ¨Äects were maintained
over the 4-week period. the drug was well tolerated, and

as in the dose ranging trial, nausea, headache, and
diarrhea were the most commonly reported adverse
eÔ¨Äects. there were no serious adverse events in either
trial. nine  xxxd2513xxx  patients withdrew because
of side eÔ¨Äects in the Ô¨Årst trial, and 15  xxxd2513xxx 
patients withdrew from the second trial. the withdrawal
rate of placebo-treated patients was not reported. mildto-moderate nausea occurred more frequently in the
 xxxd2513xxx -treated group than in the placebo group in
the second study (21% vs. 4.2%, p value not reported).31
the potential for rebound constipation to develop
after drug withdrawal after 4 weeks of treatment was
evaluated in 128 subjects (mean age and sex were not
reported).32 all subjects were treated with 24 mg of
 xxxd2513xxx  twice daily for 4 weeks after a 2-week
washout period. after the treatment period, subjects were
randomized to receive 3 additional weeks of  xxxd2513xxx 
or placebo. the subjects, who, at baseline, all met the
deÔ¨Ånition of constipation described previously, experienced a rapid and sustained improvement in sbm similar
to that seen in the other trials (1.36 per week at baseline
vs. 6.25, 5.94, 5.52 at weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively;
p<0.0001 at all weeks). after randomization to placebo
or to continued treatment with  xxxd2513xxx , the rate
of relapse, which was deÔ¨Åned as fewer than 3 bowel
movements per week, was monitored in both groups. by
the end of the 3-week period, sbm frequency declined in
the placebo group alone (3.04 vs. 5.59; p = 0.0464). in the
placebo group, 44% relapsed to constipation compared
with 18% on  xxxd2513xxx  (p = 0.0223). the frequency of
sbm on placebo remained improved from baseline (3.04
vs. 1.36; p = 0.0223) arguing against signiÔ¨Åcant rebound
constipation after the withdrawal of  xxxd2513xxx .
the long-term eÔ¨Écacy of  xxxd2513xxx  in constipation has been studied in 3 large, open-label studies.33 the
trials incorporated a total of 880 patients and assessed the
severity of constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort periodically throughout the study periods (308
patients were entered into one 24-week study; a total of
572 patients were entered into 2 separate 48-week trials).
symptoms were assessed with a 5-point scale; baseline
assessments were not reported. there were statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in all symptoms throughout the
trial (p<0.0001). assessments of constipation severity
improved across all 3 studies by an average of 1.28 points
at weeks 4 to 6 (n = 828), 1.47 at week 24 (n = 512), and
1.38 at week 48 (n = 281). bloating improved by an
average of 0.89 points at weeks 4 to 6 (n = 829), 0.98
points at 24 weeks (n = 512), and 1.00 points at 48 weeks
(n = 282). abdominal discomfort improved by an average of 0.74 points at weeks 1 (n = 619), 0.91 points at 24
weeks (n = 512), and 0.87 points at 48 weeks (n = 282).
subgroup analyses of the controlled trials and of the
open-label trials showed no signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerences in
eÔ¨Écacy and no increase in adverse events among elderly
subjects (deÔ¨Åned as z65-y old). pooled data from 3 of
the previously described 4-week controlled trials yielded
31 elderly patients in the placebo groups and 26 patients
in the  xxxd2513xxx  group.34 improvements in sbm

frequency during each of the 4 weeks ranged from 4.6 to
5.4 on  xxxd2513xxx  compared with 1.29 to 2.27 sbm for
placebo (p<0.0286). the rate of adverse eÔ¨Äects was
lower among elderly subjects on  xxxd2513xxx  compared
with their counterparts on placebo (46% vs. 61%; p value
not reported). the speciÔ¨Åc types of adverse eÔ¨Äects were
not described. in a subgroup analysis of the open-label
trials, pooled data yielded 163 elderly subjects (z65-y
old) and 715 nonelderly subjects.35 fewer elderly patients
reported adverse eÔ¨Äects when treated with  xxxd2513xxx 
compared with nonelderly subjects (74.2% vs. 80.1%;
p value not reported). the most common side eÔ¨Äect,
nausea, was less common among elderly subjects
(17.8% vs. 29.4%; p value not reported). the severity
of constipation, abdominal bloating, and abdominal
discomfort improved at all time points for both elderly
patients and nonelderly patients, compared with baseline
(p<0.0001). in summary, despite the smaller total
number of elderly patients, analysis of pooled data
indicates that  xxxd2513xxx  is eÔ¨Äective and safe for
treatment of constipation in the elderly.
similarly, because the initial trials predominantly
enrolled women, a subgroup analysis of the 4-week
controlled trials was performed to evaluate the eÔ¨Écacy of
 xxxd2513xxx  in men.36 pooled data yielded 27 male
placebo subjects and 32  xxxd2513xxx  subjects. male
subjects taking  xxxd2513xxx  experienced 5.69 to 6.05
sbms per week compared with 2.55 to 3.23 in the placebo
group (p<0.0489 at week 3, p = 0.0503 at week 4).
these rates were higher compared with females in the
trials (4.99 to 5.75 sbms/wk). fifty percent of patients,
male subjects, taking  xxxd2513xxx  experienced at least
one side eÔ¨Äect compared with 33.3% of men taking
placebo (details of adverse eÔ¨Äects were not reported).

higher than the corresponding recommended dose for
humans. even at these high doses (166 times the
recommended 48 mg in humans) adverse eÔ¨Äects were due
to weight loss rather than a direct toxic eÔ¨Äect of
 xxxd2513xxx . although it is exceedingly diÔ¨Écult to
translate reproductive and developmental, we would
recommend that  xxxd2513xxx  not be used during
pregnancy because human reproductive data is not
currently available. before initiating therapy, a pregnancy
test should be checked in all women of child-bearing age
not using a reliable form of birth control. the manufacturers have recommended that  xxxd2513xxx  be used
during pregnancy only if the beneÔ¨Åts signiÔ¨Åcantly outweigh any potential risks. the food and drug administration (fda) has given  xxxd2513xxx  a category c
rating in pregnancy. given this limited data, we would
also recommend that  xxxd2513xxx  not be used during
breastfeeding.

adverse effects and safety

 xxxd2513xxx  also seems to improve opioid-induced
constipation in animals. studies in morphine and
 xxxd2513xxx -treated mice have demonstrated increased
intestinal transit time when compared with mice treated
with morphine alone.40 furthermore, the study demonstrated no loss of analgesia in animals treated with both
 xxxd2513xxx  and morphine. of note, studies to evaluate
the eÔ¨Écacy and safety of  xxxd2513xxx  in opioid-induced
constipation in humans have not yet been performed.

one study of 26 healthy volunteers was designed to
speciÔ¨Åcally evaluate the safety and tolerability of  xxxd2513xxx .37 subjects in each group received either placebo
or 1 of 3 doses of  xxxd2513xxx  (72 mg, 90 mg, or 108 mg
divided into 3 daily doses). the subjects were monitored
closely for 7 days without any changes in electrocardiograms, laboratory testing, or vital signs. there were no
serious adverse events. two subjects who withdrew from
the study did so voluntarily and had no adverse events.
almost all of the adverse events consisted of gi
symptoms including vomiting, nausea, and abdominal
cramping. the mechanism of  xxxd2513xxx -associated
nausea is not known. however, it is possible that Ô¨Çuid
secretion could transiently distend the lumen of the upper
gi tract, thereby, leading to nausea. as expected, subjects
receiving  xxxd2513xxx  experienced more diarrhea than
those on placebo. the eÔ¨Äect did not seem to be dose
dependent as no more diarrhea was observed at the higher
doses of  xxxd2513xxx .
the eÔ¨Äects of  xxxd2513xxx  on reproduction and
development have been assessed in 2 animal studies
involving rats.38  xxxd2513xxx  did not aÔ¨Äect fertility,
reproduction, or development except at doses many times

pain scores and bowel movement frequency more than
doubled in all  xxxd2513xxx  treatment groups as compared
with placebo, during the Ô¨Årst 8 weeks of the study. these
improvements seemed to be dose related. similarly, the
adverse eÔ¨Äect incidence and drop-out rate increased at the
higher doses. symptom scores and adverse events were
not reported.

intestinal ischemia
the treatment of ischemic injury has been another
area of interest for  xxxd2513xxx  researchers. pge2 has
been shown to stimulate recovery of barrier function in
animal models of intestinal ischemia. these beneÔ¨Åcial
eÔ¨Äects are thought to be mediated via  xxxg472xxx  channels.
animal models have shown that  xxxd2513xxx  may hasten
recovery of barrier function in ischemic ileum and colon.
these provocative preliminary results warrant further
research to determine whether  xxxd2513xxx  could be a
novel pharmacologic agent for intestinal ischemia.41

subjects showed that  xxxd2513xxx  delays gastric emptying
time.26 scintigraphic gastric emptying studies revealed a
t1/2 of 132.4 ¬± 5.9 minutes in the  xxxd2513xxx -treated
group compared with 106.1 ¬± 5.5 minutes in the placebo
group (p = 0.003). consistent with its proven clinical
beneÔ¨Åts in constipated patients,  xxxd2513xxx  signiÔ¨Åcantly
increased small bowel transit time (p = 0.017) and
increased colonic transit times at 24 hours (p = 0.033).
thirty minutes after subjects ingested a satiating meal,
multiple symptoms were measured, including nausea,
bloating, pain, and fullness. only fullness showed a
signiÔ¨Åcant improvement with  xxxd2513xxx . on a 100-mm
analog scale  xxxd2513xxx  fullness scores were signiÔ¨Åcantly lower (55.4 ¬± 3.4 vs. 68.5 ¬± 3.1, p = 0.008).
theoretically, the observed delay in gastric emptying
with  xxxd2513xxx  could prove useful in patients with
functional dyspepsia who have accelerated gastric emptying. similarly, the reduction in fullness might improve
symptoms of early satiety. further clinical study in these
areas is needed to address these provocative questions.

drug development and distribution
 xxxd2513xxx  was developed by dr ryuji ueno of
sucampo pharmaceuticals, which entered into a licensing
agreement with takeda pharmaceuticals in november
2004.  xxxd2513xxx  is marketed in the united states by
takeda pharmaceuticals north america, inc. a new
drug application for  xxxd2513xxx  was submitted to the
fda on march 31, 2005. using the results of the phase 2
safety studies and phase 3 eÔ¨Écacy studies described
above, the fda approved  xxxd2513xxx  on january 31,
2006 for both men and women (age 18 and over) with
chronic constipation.  xxxd2513xxx  is being marketed in
the united states under the trade name  xxxd2513xxx . it is
available in a gelatin capsule and the recommended
dosing is 24 mg po twice daily. no restrictions have been
placed on the length of its use.

summary
chronic constipation is a highly prevalent problem
that reduces patients‚Äô quality of life and imposes
signiÔ¨Åcant economic burdens on the us healthcare
system. current fda approved therapies for constipation have focused on enhancing intestinal peristalsis
by stimulating  xxxg1117xxx  serotonin receptors ( xxxd3302xxx ) or
increasing intestinal transit through an osmotic eÔ¨Äect
(lactulose, peg-3350).
 xxxd2513xxx , an oral bicyclic fatty acid metabolite
of  xxxd124xxx , was recently approved by the fda for the
treatment of chronic constipation. by selectively stimulating type 2 chloride channels in the apical membrane of
epithelial cells,  xxxd2513xxx  enhances eÔ¨Ñux of chloride
into the intestinal lumen. the resultant Ô¨Çuid secretion into
the gi lumen likely provides a bolus eÔ¨Äect that softens
stool, increases intestinal transit, and improves symptoms
of constipation.  xxxd2513xxx  acts locally within the
intestinal tract, is rapidly metabolized, and has very low
systemic bioavailability.

preclinical trials have shown high speciÔ¨Åcity of the
drug for the  xxxg472xxx  channels. animal studies have shown
that  xxxd2513xxx  signiÔ¨Åcantly increases small intestinal
Ô¨Çuid volume and also elevates intestinal Ô¨Çuid chloride
concentration without altering serum electrolyte concentrations. double-blinded, randomized human studies
have demonstrated that  xxxd2513xxx  accelerates small
bowel and colonic transit. well-designed clinical trials
and larger open-label trials have established  xxxd2513xxx 
as a safe and eÔ¨Äective treatment for chronic constipation
that is generally well tolerated. this new medication,
which acts through an entirely diÔ¨Äerent mechanism,
provides clinicians with another treatment option for
chronic constipation.
