key words: oxidative phosphorylation; thermodynamic control; kinetic control;  xxxg215xxx  stoichiometry; atpase/atp
synthase; mitochondrion; (yeast); (rat liver); (bovine heart)

control processes in oxidative phosphorylation have been studied in three experimental models. (1) in isolated yeast
mitochondria, external atp is a regulatory effector of cytochrome-c oxidase activity. in phosphorylating or uncoupling
states, the relationships between respiratory rate and a/~n+, and the respiratory rate and cytochrome-c oxidase
reduction level are dependent on this kinetic regulation. (2) in rat liver mitochondria, the response of the respiratory
rate to uncoupler addition is age-dependent: liver mitochondria isolated from young rats maintain a greater d/~ n + than
liver mitochondria isolated from adults, with the same respiratory rate obtained with the same concentration of
uncoupler. this behaviour is linked to redox  xxxg215xxx  properties, i.e., to the degree of intrinsic uncoupling induced
by uncoupler addition. (3) the effect of  xxxd118xxx , a new kind of atpase/atpsynthase inhibitor, was studied in
mammalian mitochondria. (i)  xxxd118xxx  inhibits oligomycin-sensitive atpase - it decreases the a t p / o value without
any change in a/~h+; (ii)  xxxd118xxx  increases the mechanistic h + / a t p stoichiometry of atpase/atpsynthase; (iii)
 xxxd118xxx -induced changes in h +/atpase stoichiometry depend on the flux magnitude through atpase. these results
are discussed in terms of the following interdependent parameters: flux value, force, pump efficiency and control
coefficient.

introduction
within the framework of the chemiosmotic theory,
the proton electrochemical potential difference, named
a/2h+, acts as coupling intermediate between proton
pumps embedded in an energy-transducing membrane
[1]. mechanisms as well as thermodynamic control of
oxidative phosphorylation have been studied, widely
leading to considerable interest in the nature of relationships between flow (respiratory or phosphorylation
rates) and forces (a/2h+, free energies of redox or of
phosphorylation reactions, i.e., ago/r or agp). since

such reactions are generally linear and sometimes symmetrical, they have been interpreted in terms of phenomenological linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics
[2-4]. it is usually assumed that flow force relationships
are independent of the manner in which forces vary, i.e.,
at a constant  xxxd1002xxx , a given reduction in a/~h+ could be
associated with a given increase in respiratory rate,
whatever the means utilized. however, this prediction is
rarely observed. for instance, in rat liver mitochondria,
most authors have found that the onset of atp synthesis is accompanied by a diminution in a/~n+, which is
less than that observed when respiration is ihcreased to
the same extent with an uncoupler [5-9]. on the other
hand, a unique relationship has recently been observed
[10]. to explain this discrepancy, it has been proposed
that: (i) some experimental conditions inducing systematic deviations in a/~h+ evaluations are a source of
erroneous relationships [10,11]; (ii) delocalized a/2h+ is
not, in fact, the direct free-energy intermediate and
alternative models are necessary (see several proposi.
tions in ref. 12-16). however, the assumption that the
linearity in the flow force relationships coincides with
the 'onsager-domain' of non-equilibrium is still in
question [17]. in the absence of any indispensable theo-

retical justification, a 'black box' description of oxidative phosphorylation (in terms of near equilibrium domain) is not satisfactory.
the aim of this paper is to gain further insight into
the interdependence between flux value, force size, pump
efficiency and control distribution within the metabolic
network.

tion was monitored with a potassium-sensitive electrode. at a given steady state, oxygen consumption or
atpase activity were measured and the charge efflux
catalyzed by this pump was determined from the initial
rate of k + efflux following addition of a specific inhibitor to this pump - either 0.2 /~m antimycin or 5 #m
 xxxd2682xxx  (respiratory chain) and 100/~m oligomycin
or 100/xm tet (atpase), respectively.

materials and methods

mitochondria preparation
cell culture conditions, mitochondria preparation and
other methods used in yeast mitochondria studies have
been detailed elsewhere [19-21]. bovine heart mitochondria were isolated according to a mechanical
method [22]. male wistar rats were killed by cervical
dislocation and their liver mitochondria were isolated
according to ref. 23. the protein concentration was
estimated by the  xxxd2444xxx  method using bovine serum
albumin as a standard.
respiration assay and a tp / o measurement
the oxygen consumption rate was measured polarographically at 30 °c using a clark electrode connected
to a microcomputer giving an on-line display of rate
values. two different respiratory media were used (i) for
bovine heart mitochondria: 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm
egta, 5/~m rotenone, 10 mm succinate, 3 mm tris-pi,
10 ~tm rbc1, 0.2 nmol  xxxd3484xxx  per mg protein and
10 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.2) and (ii) for rat liver mitochondria: isolation medium (see above) supplied with
10 mm succinate, 5 /~m rotenone, 10 mm tris-pi, 10
#m rbc1 and 0.2 nmol  xxxd3484xxx  per mg protein
(ph 7.2). atp/o stoichiometries were determined as
described in ref. 21.
measurements of aph, aq and pi, adp and a t p concentrations
matrix space, aph and axo were determined as
previously described [20] with a slight modification:
aph was estimated from bhm and rlm, using the
distribution of [14c]dmo (5,5-dimethyl[2-14c]oxazoli dine- xxxd309xxx ) instead of [3h]acetate. atp and adp
were measured in protein-free neutralized extracts by
hplc [21], and pi was measured according to summer
[24].
determination of k + / 0 or of k +/a tp
the technique for measuring the electrical charge
upon o (k+/o) and upon atp (k+/atp) ratios at
steady state was as described by murphy and brand
[25]. this method is based on strict equality of the rate
of charge efflux from mitochondria, catalyzed by a
 xxxg215xxx  and the involved carriers (i.e., adp/atp
exchange) to the charge influx, catalyzed by  xxxd3484xxx , at a given steady state. the potassium concentra-

mammalian mitochondria
atpase activity was estimated by hplc analysis of
protein-free neutralized extracts [21].  xxxd118xxx  ((bisallylamino-4,6-s-triazinyl-2)-i-(bis-p- fluorobenzhydryl)-4piperazine(bismethanesulfonate)) was a gift from servier
laboratory, france.
results and discussion

flow/force relationships depend on the kinetic properties
of the components of oxidative phosphorylation
we have already presented variations of redox states
of cytochromes, control on respiration rate by cytochrome-c oxidase and protonmotive force size as a
function of the respiratory rate of yeast mitochondria
under three different types of steady-state [21].
(a) respiration is stimulated by atp synthesis with
ethanol as respiratory substrate. this has been performed at a saturating adp concentration and different
concentrations of pi (conditions 1).
(b) the respiratory rate is stimulated by a proton-leak
increase which is obtained by adding different amounts
of cccp in the presence of oligomycin and carboxyatractylate, for blocking atp synthesis and the
a d p / a t p carrier respectively (conditions 2).
(c) experimental conditions as in (b) except for the
addition of 0.4 mm atp (conditions 3).
under conditions 1, cytochromes a+a3, highly
oxidized in state 4, remained poorly reduced when the
respiratory rate increased. in contrast, under conditions
2, when the respiratory rate arose, the reduction level of
cytochrome-c oxidase largely increased. the kinetic behaviour of cytochrome-c oxidase depends of the way in
which the oxygen consumption flux is modulated: uncoupling leads to a large increase of its reduction level
(up to 30%), whereas during phosphorylation, and at the
same respiratory rate, cytochrome-c oxidase remains
slightly reduced (less than 10%). under conditions 3,
the dependence of the cytochrome-c oxidase reduction
level on the respiratory rate was the same as that
observed under conditions 1. it should be noted that
atp addition did not change the respiratory rate
whatever cccp concentration was used.
a theoretical framework, introduced by higgins [26],
reformulated later and developed by kacser and burns
[27], and heinrich and rapoport [28], respectively, has

fig. 1. relationships between respiratory rate and protonmotive force in yrlm (a) and in arlm (b). measurements of respiratory rate (j0) and
protonmotive force (ap) were performed as described in materials and methods in standard medium with either: 0.5 mm adp and various pi
concentrations (0.5-8 mm) (e); or 10 mm pi, 5 #m  xxxd3271xxx , 25 # g / m l oligomycin and different cccp concentrations (0-0.25
#m) (•).

been used to quantify the relative contribution of different enzymatic steps to the control of oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian [29-32] and yeast [33] mitochondria. one of the main parameters in control analysis, cej, corresponds to the flux control coefficient of
enzyme, ej, on flux j. kacser and burns [27] have
elaborated a possible determination of this parameter
by inhibitor titration studies. this approach was applied
for measuring the flux control coefficient of cytochrome-c oxidase using potassium cyanide as previously
described [33]. flux control coefficient of cytochrome-c
oxidase increased only slightly when the respiratory rate
was stimulated, either by adp + pi or by cccp, in the
presence of atp (from 0.08 in state 4 to 0.15 at maximal rate). in contrast, this coefficient significantly increased up to 0.44, when the flux was modulated by
cccp, in the absence of atp. uncoupler depresses
a/ill+ m o r e than adp + pi at equivalent respiratory
rates. however, in the presence of atp, uncoupler
addition leads to a flow/force relationship identical to
that observed during oxidative phosphorylation.
in conclusion, in yeast mitochondria, in parallel to
the fact that the respiratory rate is not dependent on
a/in+ only, the redox state of cytochromes is not dependent on the respiratory rate; indeed, at the same
respiratory rate, cytochrome a + a 3 is more reduced in
the presence of uncoupler than in the presence of adp
+ pr this indicates various types of kinetic behaviour
in this complex. it is worth noting that for a given value
of oxygen uptake, this higher degree of cytochrome
a + a 3 reduction is paralleled by a lower value of a/in+.
under uncoupling conditions, added atp changes the
reduction level of cytochromes a + a3; this effect is due
to external atp, since it occurs when translocase is
inhibited by carboxyatractylate. our data support the

view that cytosolic atp is a kinetic effector to cytochrome-c oxidase. if one assumes that atp increases
the enzymatic capacity of cytochrome-c oxidase without
stimulating respiration, the following events should occur: (i) a decrease of the control of the respiratory rate
by this complex; (ii) a change in the distribution of
control in one or many other steps. thus, a unique
relationship between a flux and its associated forces can
be expected only if the conditions used for modifying
the forces do not change the kinetic structure of the
system.
age-dependent change in the redox  xxxg215xxx  intrinsic
uncoupling
liver mitochondria, isolated from rats aged either 6
weeks (yrlm) or 10 weeks (arlm), were used. in
yrlm, there was a unique steep-dependence of the
respiratory rate on the magnitude of a/in+; in contrast,
in arlm, two relationships between respiratory rate
and a/ill+ w e r e observed: uncoupler decreases a/xh+
more than adp + pi at an equivalent respiratory rate.
it should be noted that, under phosphorylation conditions, the dependence of the respiratory rate on a/ill÷
was the same in both kinds of mitochondrion. moreover, the a t p / o ratio was identical in both types of
mitochondrion. thus, the only difference observed concemed the response to cccp, i.e., for the same respiratory rate obtained with the same concentration of cccp,
yrlm maintained a greater a/in÷ than arlm. two
non-exclusive hypotheses can be proposed: (i) at a given
cccp concentration, the same h ÷ back-flow is obtained for a a/ill÷ value which is greater in yrlm
than in arlm; (ii) cccp could induce an intrinsic
uncoupling of the respiratory chain as previously described by luvisetto et al. [35]. in such a case, intrinsic

188
uncoupling must be greater in arlm than in yrlm,
at a given cccp concentration• in order to test the first
alternative, mitochondrial permeability to protons was
determined as the initial rate of isoosmotic swelling of
non-respiratory mitochondria [36]. indeed, when mitochondria were suspended in an isoosmotic potassium
acetate solution, in the presence of a non-limiting concentration of  xxxd3484xxx , the swelling rate was only
controlled by proton permeability. the relationship between the initial swelling rate and cccp concentration
was identical in yrlm and arlm. the k + / o ratio
was measured at different steady states, corresponding
to different cccp concentrations, according to murphy
and brand [25]. in yrlm, the k * / o value was constant whatever the respiratory rate, indicating that intrinsic uncoupling of the respiratory chain did not increase• in contrast, in arlm, the k ÷ / o ratio decreased drastically, whereas the cccp concentration
increased, indicating a reduction of the proton pumping
efficiency of the respiratory chain. thus, flow/force
relationships appeared to be linked to properties of the
redox  xxxg215xxx . cccp, which is a protonophore,
induces a secondary effect on arlm, i.e., it increases
the degree of intrinsic uncoupling. in contrast to what is
observed in yeast, atp addition does not modify the
flux/force relationships in arlm. it would be of interest to measure the effect of atp in redox  xxxg215xxx 
slipping in yeast mitochondria (work underway). however, the mechanism by which some protonophoric uncouplers induce a molecular slipping of the respiratory
chain remains an open question.

flux-dependent  xxxd118xxx -induced increase in stoichiometry of charge translocation by a tpase / a tpsynthase
the mechanism of action of  xxxd118xxx  was investigated in three kinds of mitochondrion isolated from
yeast, rat liver and bovine heart. although rlm were
more  xxxd118xxx -sensitive (at least 10-times) than bhm
or yeast mitochondria, this drug exhibited similar effects in all types of mitochondrion. the first study on
yeast mitochondria [19] displayed the following features: (i) atmitrine at a concentration of 30 /~m inhibited oligomycin-sensitive atpase activity with 50%
inhibition; (ii) no direct effect on respiration could be
evidenced; (iii) during oxidative phosphorylation, the
atp/o ratio decreased largely without any change in
the magnitude of a/ill.; (iv) the higher the atp synthesis and respiratory fluxes are, the larger is the
 xxxd118xxx -induced decrease in the atp/o ratio. thus,
 xxxd118xxx  appears to act essentially on the atpase complex, but its effect is very different from that of classical
atp synthase inhibitors such as oligomycin or aurovertin d, which decrease atp synthesis and respiratory
rates in such a manner that the a t p / o ratio remains
constant. recently, a new type of uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation has been described in the litera-

ture. for instance, general anaesthetics, such as chloroform or halothane, inhibit atp synthesis, stimulate
mitochondrial atpase activity and state 4 respiration
like pure protonophoric uncouplers, but have no measurable effect on a/~n. magnitude [37]. consequently,
by comparing the effect of  xxxd118xxx  to that of different
kinds of inhibitor and uncoupler, it appears clear that
 xxxd118xxx  corresponds to a new type of mitochondrial
energy-transduction inhibitor. two hypotheses may be
suggested for explaining the mechanism whereby  xxxd118xxx  decreases the a t p / o ratio: either (i) it increases intrinsic uncoupling of h÷-atpase, also called
slip [38,39]; or (ii) it changes the real h÷/atp ratio of
atpase/atpsynthase.
a change in  xxxg215xxx  stoichiometry could be
interpreted as an increase in slipping if coupling efficiency between proton flux and the chemical reaction
is decreased, regardless of the direction of the reaction
(i.e., atp synthesis and atp hydrolysis)• in contrast,
experimental proof of real mechanistic change in the
stoichiometry is provided by the observation of the
same degree of stoichiometry in forward and in reverse
chemical reactions•
to investigate whether  xxxd118xxx  modifies the
q+/atp ratio of the atpase/atp synthase complex,
we tested the action of this drug on the atp-consuming
process. a very simple system is the energy-dependent
potassium salt uptake, which can be followed by
 xxxd3484xxx -induced mitochondrial swelling [40]. a1mitrine does not change the extent of swelling of bhm
or of rlm either in  xxxd2987xxx  or potassium
phosphate when the  xxxg215xxx  is the respiratory
chain. however, energy-linked swelling, supported by
oligomycin-sensitive atpase, is largely increased by
 xxxd118xxx . moreover,  xxxd118xxx  slightly decreases atpase
activity. thus, in the presence of  xxxd118xxx , a lower rate
of atp hydrolysis leads to the maintenance of a greater
transmembrane salt gradient, indicating a better efficiency of such a  xxxg215xxx . this is corroborated by
electrical charge/atp ratio measurements. in experiments performed without  xxxd118xxx , the k + / a t p value
was 2.7 + 0.3; therefore, stoichiometry of the atpase
 xxxg215xxx  can be estimated to be 1.7 + 0.3. a 2-fold
increase in this ratio was observed at an  xxxd118xxx 
concentration of approx. 45 #m.
it is generally proposed that atp synthase works
through a reaction cycle in which conforrnational transitions of the complex, corresponding to energy span,
occur (see ref. 41 for a review). in this view, the
energy-dependent conformational cycle is coupled to a
proton flux through the complex. as a working hypothesis, one may suggest that  xxxd118xxx  modifies at
least a given state of enzyme into the cycle in such a
way that the energy span between this state and the
following one is increased. indeed, in the presence of
 xxxd118xxx , more energy is needed for synthesizing 1 mol

189
of atp, at a given a/~h+ , and reciprocally, more energy
is delivered by hydrolyzing 1 mol of atp.
whatever the mechanism may be by which  xxxd118xxx 
acts on the complex, it is likely that inhibition of
atpase/atp synthase activity is linked to the change
in h+/atp stoichiometry. such dependence between
the increase in the h+/atp ratio and inhibition of
atpase activity could be explained in the context of the
above-mentioned hypothesis, since an increase in the
energy span between two steps of the cycle reduces the
probability of a transition between the two steps.

concluding remarks
oxidative phosphorylations cannot be considered as
a system in which flows are only determined by thermodynamic force values. indeed, flux, force, pump efficiency and kinetic control appear as interdependent
parameters within the metabolic network. as an example, at a given force value, flux depends on pump
efficiency and/or on kinetic structure. in turn, it has
recently been reported that the efficiency of oxidative
phosphorylation (atp/o) is flux value-dependent, at a
given force (a/2n+) [42]. it would be of great interest to
investigate the physiological consequences of variable
stoichiometry on cell adaptability to various types of
constraint.
