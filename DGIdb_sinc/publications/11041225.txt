one common side-effect of contraceptive use is
that it often leads to disrupted endometrial
bleeding patterns. this may be due to changes
in endothelial density and vessel integrity. to
investigate whether the level of endometrial
immunoreactive vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf),  xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) have any role in this,
women were treated with either mircette®, a
monophasic oral contraceptive, or implanon®,
a long-acting gestagen, and immunohistochemistry performed. in addition a small number of endometria were studied from women
treated with levonorgestrel released from an
intrauterine coil. during the untreated normal
cycle, there was a significant increase in glandular vegf immunoreactivity and a significant
decrease in pr immunoreactivity in the midand late secretory phases compared to the proliferative phase. there was a significant positive
correlation between stromal vegf immunoreactivity and endothelial cell density. this correlation was also apparent during treatment
with implanon, but not with mircette. disrupted
bleeding patterns were associated with
implanon and to a lesser extent with mircette.
both contraceptives significantly reduced
glandular vegf immunoreactivity but the
intrauterine treatment with levonorgestrel

resulted in strong glandular epithelial staining
and intense staining of decidualized stromal
cells. implanon significantly increased glandular
pr staining, but mircette significantly reduced
stromal pr staining when compared to secretory
phase before-treatment biopsies. there were no
changes in endothelial cell density or glandular
or stromal er during the normal cycle, or
with use of either contraceptive. there was no
association of the parameters measured with
bleeding patterns or histological category.

introduction
one form of contraception which has many attractions is that of a long-acting gestogen which is
either administered systemically or locally by an
intrauterine system (ius). such a regimen does
not require daily treatment and has long-term
contraceptive efficacy. however, a serious disadvantage of such methods is frequent or irregular
bleeding episodes. these complications are the
most frequent cause of discontinuation of such
contraceptive methods.
hormonal control of gene expression is of fundamental importance in many tissues. the uterine

 xxxg1737xxx  (pr) as reflected by immunohistochemistry and endothelial cell density in the
endometrium (i) throughout the normal menstrual
cycle and (i) after using two different contraceptives: implanon and mircette. the relationship
between these parameters and the observed bleeding patterns and histology was analysed. in addition
a study was performed in which endometrial vegf
immunoreactivity and macrophage distribution was
investigated in women before and while using a
levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine coil.

materials and methods
subjects
normally menstruating women from the usa were
recruited into one of two separate study groups
using different methods of contraception. the first
14 subjects used a progestin-only contraceptive,
implanon (organon, cambridge, uk), a nonbiodegradable implant with a duration of action of
3 years containing and releasing  xxxd2067xxx . the
next 20 subjects used mircette (organon), a 21
day monophasic combined oral contraceptive
containing 20 |ug ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx  and 150 (ig
 xxxd1849xxx , with 10 (ig ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx /day
administered for 5 days immediately before the
next pill cycle.
endometrial biopsies were taken on an outpatient basis by pipelle suction curette before
treatment and -12 months after commencement.
specimens were formalin-fixed and embedded
in paraffin (56-57°c melting point; surgipath
medical industries, richmond, il, usa). sections
(5 |im) were mounted on 2% aminopropyltriethoxysilane (sigma, poole, uk)-coated slides. one
section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin
for classification by a gynaecological histopathologist. these categories were normal proliferative,
early secretory (i.e. days dated 15-19), mid-secretory (days 20-22) and late secretory (days 23-28
(hendrickson and kempson, 1980), atrophic, or
oral contraceptive effect (i.e. consistent with
exogenous progestin administration). additional
sections were used for immunohistochemistry as
described below.

endometrium is a prime example of such a tissue
and is highly responsive to the ovarian sex steroids.
these responses include rapid tissue growth and
remodelling, blood vessel development and protein
secretion. each of these processes necessitates
complex cell-cell interactions. advances made in
the understanding of reproductive function have
largely centred on the control of production and
action of steroid hormones. indeed most gynaecological medical intervention is based on steroidal/
antisteroidal regulation of the uterus. however,
while it is clearly recognized that steroids control
endometrial function, paracrine and autocrine factors are now being seen as key mediators of
reproductive function, albeit interacting with steroids. for example, in the ovariectomized mouse
the uterus undergoes marked growth in response
to single doses of  xxxd2037xxx . this effect can
be blocked by anti-transforming growth factor-cc
(tgfoc) antibody suggesting that the mitogenic
effects of oestrogen in this tissue are mediated
by tgfoc. within the endometrium the cytokine/
growth factor signals that pass between the stroma
and epithelium and the epithelium and embryo are
at present unclear. in addition other cell types in
the endometrium such as leukocytes and endothelial cells also respond to ovarian steroids, although
this may well be an indirect action.
one growth factor which could mediate this
interaction is  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf). this is a potent angiogenic growth factor
(ferrara et al., 1992) and is produced in both
glands and stromal cells of the endometrium and
also myometrial smooth muscle cells (charnockjones et al., 1993; smith, 1998). vegf mrna is
up-regulated in the immature rat uterus in response
to  xxxd2037xxx ,  xxxd2043xxx  and progesterone (cullinanbove and koos, 1993; hyder et al., 1996). alterations in the normal distribution of vegf due to
the administration of synthetic steroids may be
responsible for any resulting aberrant bleeding.
this may be due to an increase in vascular permeability, changes in the thrombotic balance (vegf
induces endothelial upa and pai-1) or increased
capillary number.
the aims of the present study were to compare
parameters which may be important in endometrial
bleeding: vegf, oestrogen recpetor (er), and

effects of progestins on endometrium

levonorgestrel study
women (n = 12), seeking medical attention for
the typical symptoms of oestrogen deficiency such
as hot flushes, excessive sweating or vaginal dryness were recruited to this study. the intrauterine
device used released with 5 (n = 6) or 10 (n =
6) |-lg/24 h of levonorgestrel (leiras oy, turku,
finland) and all women also received transdermal
17p- xxxd2037xxx  (50 |lg/25 h  xxxd2037xxx ; novartis,
uk). endometrial biopsies were collected by
pipelle prior to treatment and also after both 6 and
12 months treatment.
the immunostaining of the endometria from
these women was performed in a similar manner
except that the final chromogenic substrate was
diaminobenzidine (dab) which resulted in brown
staining. macrophages (and some other cells of
myeloid origin) were identified by specific staining
for cd68 (dako m0876, high wycombe,
bucks, uk) and the double-stained macrophages
and vegf positive cells detected fluorescently

with fluoroscein isothiocyanate and tritc
(tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate) labelled
anti-mouse and rabbit antibodies respectively.
er and pr
separate sections were stained for  xxxg730xxx  (era) and pr using mouse monoclonal
antibodies: er 1d5 (dako) and pr-at 4.14 (abr,
golden co., co, usa). antigen retrieval was
carried out by microwaving in 0.01 mol/1 sodium
citrate buffer (ph 6.0) for 10 min at 500 w.
antibodies were diluted 1/50 in protein blocking
solution (1.5% normal horse serum, 2% bsa in
pbs-tween) and incubated overnight at 4°c after
a 30 min pre-block. the secondary antibody was
biotinylated horse anti-mouse (vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca, usa), diluted 1/200 for 45 min.
this was followed by the vectastain elite abc
complex (1/200, 30 min), then metal-enhanced
diaminobenzidine (pierce, chester, uk) in peroxidase buffer, 10 min, and haematoxylin for 30 s.
sections were dehydrated and mounted in depx
(merck, poole, uk).
the glandular epithelium and stromal cell compartments from each stained section were scored
subjectively on a scale of 0-4 by two or three
independent observers. for vegf, the scores were
based on the staining intensity of the majority of
cells. for er and pr, however, modified h-scores
were assigned (ravn et al., 1993). first an estimate
was made for the fraction (%) of stained cells in
each compartment: 0 = 0-9%, 1 = 10-39%, 2 =
40-69%, 3 = 70-89%, and 4 = 90-100%. second,
the staining intensity (i) was scored: 0 = no
staining, 1 = weak but definite staining, 2 =
moderate staining, 3 = pronounced staining, and
4 = intense staining. the h-score was then calculated by the formula (%xl)/4. the averaged subjective scores were analysed by the non-parametric
wilcoxon test for paired samples (before versus
after treatment).
endothelial cell density
separate sections were stained to determine the
number of endothelial cell (ec) nuclei per mm2.
the method used was essentially as described
previously [goodger (macpherson) and rogers,
1994] and used an antibody which stained all
endometrial vessels. sections were treated as for
vegf above, except that the primary antibody was

immunohistochemistry
vegf
sections were stained for vegf with an antibody
directed against amino acids 1-20 of mature human
vegf and which therefore recognizes the 121,
145, 165, 189 and 206 amino acid splice variants.
sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and washed
in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). endogenous
peroxidase was quenched with 3%  xxxd2298xxx  in pbs (10 min), before application of primary
antibody (without prior antigen unmasking): rabbit
anti-human vegf (a-20; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa), diluted to 0.5 jig/
ml in 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa-pbs),
incubated for 1 h at 37°c. this was followed by
a biotinylated secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit
igg (zymed laboratories, south san francisco
ca, usa), 1/100 in pbs (10 min); then horseradish
peroxidase-streptavadin conjugate (zymed) 1/400
in pbs (10 min). colour was developed with
aminoethylcarbazole (aec) substrate chromogen
mix (zymed), 5-10 min. sections were counterstained with diluted mayer's haemotoxylin
(1/20) for 1 min, then mounted in aqueous mounting medium (clearmount mounting solution;
zymed). for negative controls 0.5 |ig/ml normal
rabbit igg was substituted for the primary antibody.

bleeding records
daily records of vaginal bleeding were kept by
each participant for at least 13 cycles, with the
following entries: no bleeding or spotting; spotting,
requiring no more than one sanitary napkin or
tampon per day; or bleeding, requiring more than
one sanitary napkin or tampon per day. records
were analysed using a 90 day reference period
immediately prior to the day of the after-treatment
biopsy (biopsy day = day 91). definitions used
were as follows (rogers et al., 1993). (i) a
bleeding/spotting episode: one or more consecutive
days during which blood loss (bleeding or spotting)
was recorded, each episode being bounded by
two or more bleeding/spotting-free days; a single
bleeding/spotting-free day within a bleeding/spotting episode being counted as part of the episode
surrounding it. (ii) a bleeding/spotting-free interval: two or more consecutive days during which
blood loss had not occurred; each interval being
bounded by bleeding/spotting days.
bleeding during this 90 day reference period was
categorized as follows. amenorrhoea: no bleeding/
spotting; prolonged: one or more bleeding/spotting
episodes lasting 3=10 days; frequent: more than
four bleeding/spotting episodes; infrequent: less
than two bleeding/spotting episodes; irregular:
range of length of bleeding/spotting free intervals
(i.e. greatest interval minus smallest interval) >17
days; regular: two to four bleeding/spotting episodes, no bleeding/spotting episode lasting 2s 10

days, with a range of length of bleeding/spottingfree intervals of =s17 days.
statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric tests to look for possible relationships
between the vegf, er, and pr glandular and
stromal staining and endothelial cell density, and
their influence on bleeding category and histological classification of the after-treatment biopsy.
for some analyses the samples were paired (i.e.
before- and after-treatment samples from the
same woman).
results
normal menstrual cycle
vegf immunoreactivity
all before-treatment biopsies (i.e. from normal
cycles) from both studies stained for vegf (n =
31 overall) were divided into four histological
groups based on the stage of the menstrual cycle.
the groups were normal proliferative (n = 8),
early secretory in = 8), mid-secretory (n — 4) and
late secretory (n = 11). see table i for median
scores and ranges for glands and stroma. analysis
of subjective vegf immunostaining scores using
the kruskal-wallis test showed that there was a
significant increase in glandular vegf immunostaining across the cycle (p = 0.005); and dunn's
multiple comparisons test showed that the staining
during the mid- and late secretory phases was
significantly greater than that of the proliferative
phase (p < 0.05). there was no significant change
in stromal vegf staining.
er and pr immunoreactivity
pr immunoreactivity significantly decreased in the
glands across the normal cycle (p — 0.002; overall
n = 26; proliferative phase n = 8; early secretory
n = 6; mid-secretory n — 4; late secretory n =
8). dunn's multiple comparisons test showed that
the staining during the mid- and late secretory
phases was significantly weaker than that of the
proliferative phase (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 respectively). there were no significant changes in endometrial er across the normal cycle in glands or
stroma, or in the stromal pr staining. see table i
for median scores and their ranges.

mouse anti-human cd34 (qbend 10, serotec,
oxford, uk) diluted 1/25 in 1% bsa for 45
min at 37°c, and the secondary antibody was
biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse igg (zymed). all
cell nuclei were stained with undiluted haematoxylin. from these sections, an estimate of the endothelial cell density was obtained, i.e. the number
of ec nuclei per mm2. each section was viewed
under a microscope at x400, connected via a video
camera to a personal computer and sampled with
software using a uniform systematic random sampling method with a meander algorithm after
outlining the section (grid stereological software;
interactivision, silkeborg, denmark). in this way,
50 or 100 fields of known area per section were
sampled and ec nuclei counted by one observer.

n = 8, early secretory n = 7; mid-secretory n =
4; late secretory n = 9). see table i for median
scores and ranges.

implanon study
fourteen patients participated, with a median age
of 26.0 years, range 18—40 years. detailed results
showing averaged subjective scores for vegf, er
and pr staining in the glands and stroma, together
with their endothelial cell densities are shown in
table i.
immunohistochemistry
seven of the after-treatment biopsies were judged
to be inadequate, so these patients were excluded
from analysis where appropriate. no staining was
seen in negative controls. vegf staining was
always cytoplasmic. see table i for median scores
and their ranges for the immunohistochemical
parameters in after-implanon treatment biopsies.
there was a significant reduction in vegf staining
in the glands with treatment (n = 6 before- versus
after-treatment biopsy pairs, p = 0.031). there
was no change in stromal vegf staining with
treatment (see figure 1a-d for photomicrographs
of examples of vegf staining of endometrium
from the same patient before and after implanon
treatment). specific er and pr staining was always
nuclear and an example of this is shown in figure
2a-d. the glands showed significantly increased
pr staining with treatment (n = l pairs, p = 0.016)
and a trend (although not significant) towards
increased glandular er staining (n = 6 pairs, p =
0.063). there was no change in stromal er and

correlations between immunohistochemical
parameters
there was a significant positive correlation (spearman rank correlation) between endothelial density
and stromal vegf (r = 0.857, p = 0.024) in
the after-treatment biopsies. there were no other
correlations between the immunohistochemical
parameters measured in the after-implanon treatment biopsies.
menstrual bleeding pattern versus
immunohistochemical parameters
implanon disrupted the normal menstrual bleeding
pattern in all subjects and resulted in amenorrhoea
in only 4/14. kruskal-wallis analysis of variance
showed that there were no significant differences
between the observed bleeding categories during
the 90 day reference period and any of the immunohistochemical parameters measured in the afterimplanon treatment biopsies.
mircette study
twenty patients participated, with a median age of
29.5 years, range 23-47 years. detailed results
showing averaged subjective scores for vegf
staining in the glands and stroma, together with
their endothelial cell densities, histological classification and bleeding summaries are shown in
table i.
routine histology
eight before-treatment biopsies were taken during
the proliferative phase of the cycle, 11 during the
secretory phase, and one was judged to be inactive.
like implanon, mircette use altered the histological
appearance of the endometrium. of the aftertreatment biopsies, three were judged to be proliferative, two secretory, seven atrophic, seven to show
an exogenous progestogen effect, and one an
exogenous progestogen effect with shedding.
immunohistochemistry
one of the after-treatment biopsies was judged to
be inadequate for immunohistochemical staining
due to the small volume of tissue, so this patient
was excluded from analysis where appropriate. no

correlations between immunohistochemical
parameters
in order to look for possible relationships between
the various immunohistochemical parameters
measured, spearman rank correlation tests were
used. there were significant positive correlations
between glandular and stromal vegf staining (r =
0.65, p < 0.0001), glandular er and glandular
pr (r = 0.57, p = 0.003) and stromal vegf and
endothelial cell density (r = 0.38, p = 0.046);
and a negative correlation between glandular
vegf and glandular pr staining (r = -0.49,
p = 0.01).

correlations between immunohistochemical
parameters
there was a significant positive correlation (spearman rank correlation) between glandular vegf
and stromal vegf (r = 0.61, p = 0.006) after
treatment. there were no other significant correlations between the immunohistochemical parameters measured in the after-mircette treatment
biopsies.
histological category versus
immunohistochemical parameters
kruskal-wallis tests showed that the histological
category of the after-treatment biopsy did not
influence any of the immunohistochemical parameters
menstrual bleeding pattern versus
immunohistochemical parameters
mircette resulted in a regular bleeding pattern in
the majority (11/19, 58%) of subjects. of the
remaining subjects, four experienced irregular
cycles, and one each was categorized as having
either frequent, frequent and irregular, infrequent,
or prolonged bleeding. bleeding pattern data were
analysed against each of the immunohistochemical
parameters by the unpaired non-parametric test

(mann-whitney) using two groups only: regular
bleeders versus the rest; due to the very low subject
numbers in each of several different bleeding
categories. results showed that there were no
significant changes to the immunohistochemical
parameters with bleeding pattern; however, there
was a trend towards increased stromal er staining
with non-regular bleeding (p — 0.051).
levonorgestrel study
the endometrium post treatment was characterized
by a greatly reduced thickness and by the presence
of large decidual-like cells within the stroma. as
can be seen in figure 3f the glandular epithelium
and in particular the decidual cells stained intensely
for vegf. the double staining for the macrophages
showed that these cells were present in clusters
throughout the endometrium and that many (but
not all) stained strongly for vegf.

in stromal vegf staining with treatment (p =
0.639). see figure 1e-h for photomicrographs of
vegf staining of endometrium from the same
patient before and after mircette treatment.
overall, there were no changes in er or pr
staining with treatment in either the glands or
stroma. there were no significant changes in
glandular er or pr when comparing only paired
proliferative before-treatment biopsies against
after-treatment samples, or paired secretory beforetreatment biopsies against after-treatment samples.
there were also no significant changes in stromal
er or pr when comparing only paired proliferative
before-treatment biopsies against after-treatment
samples. however, when comparing only paired
secretory before-treatment biopsies against aftertreatment samples, there was significantly reduced
stromal pr staining with treatment (p = 0.027)
and a trend towards increased stromal er staining
with treatment (p = 0.065). endothelial cell density
did not change significantly with treatment.

discussion
during the normal menstrual cycle vegf immunoreactivity of the endometrial glands changed significantly, with a significant increase during the
mid- and late secretory phases compared to the
proliferative phase. stromal vegf immunoreactivity did not change through the cycle. these findings
contrast with those of li et al. (li et al., 1994),
who reported strong vegf glandular staining that
did not change during the cycle, and the strongest
stromal staining being found in discrete cells during
the mid-proliferative phase. they also contrast
with a study (lau et al., 1998) in which no
significant change in immunostaining was found
across the menstrual cycle. however, the pattern
of vegf staining reported here agrees with others
(shifren et al, 1996; torry et al, 1996), though
these studies had fewer subject numbers and no
attempt at quantification was made. it is also
in agreement with in-situ hybridization studies
(charnock-jones et al, 1993). a study with small
numbers of cynomolgus monkeys during the normal cycle also showed a significant increase in
glandular vegf staining during the secretory
phase compared to the proliferative phase (greb
et al, 1995). it is also of interest that in the present
study a simple comparison within the beforetreatment (normal cycle) group from the mircette
study of glandular vegf staining during the prolif-

vessel density correlating with increased metastasis
and/or decreased patient survival (vartanian and
weidner, 1994). however, in the present and previous studies, neither endometrial endothelial cell
density nor microvascular density [goodger
(macpherson) and rogers, 1994; rogers et al,
1993] changed throughout the normal cycle and
indeed changes in endothelial cell density do not
necessarily indicate changes in angiogenic activity
[goodger (macpherson) and rogers, 1995]. the
lack of change in intensity of stromal vegf
staining and endothelial cell density during the
cycle suggest that these parameters may be regulated by non-steroidal mechanisms. this is, however, at odds with the suggestion that glandular and
stromal vegf are regulated by similar mechanisms
and that glandular vegf is regulated by progesterone.
the contraceptives implanon, and mircette
which contains the pro-form of the same progestagen in combination with ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx , both
significantly reduced endometrial glandular immunoreactive vegf. endothelial cell density after 12
months of use showed no difference compared to
before treatment, and there was no correlation
between glandular vegf staining and endothelial
cell density for the after-treatment biopsies from
either the implanon or mircette studies. in the light
of the observation that stromal vegf correlates
with endothelial cell density during the normal
cycle, however, the reduction in glandular vegf
with contraceptive treatment may be biologically
unimportant. indeed there was a similar positive
correlation between stromal vegf and ec density
with implanon treatment, but not mircette treatment. the significantly increased glandular pr
staining with implanon use shows that  xxxd2067xxx 
alone fails to down-regulate the pr in the same
way that progesterone does. it is likely that the
balance of agonist/antagonist actions and the pr
type contributes to the end result of progestin
action. mircette, on the other hand, resulted in
significantly reduced stromal pr compared to normal secretory phase levels in response to progesterone. for both contraceptives, however, neither

erative phase (n = 8) versus the secretory phase
(n = 11) showed no significant difference.
the present study showed that glandular pr
staining was significantly reduced during the midand late secretory phases of the cycle compared to
the proliferative phase. these results agree with
those of others (snijders et al, 1992; critchley
et al, 1993) and are consistent with downregulation of pr in the glands by progesterone
(chauchereau et al, 1991; snijders et al, 1992).
the continued presence of pr in the stroma
throughout the cycle also agrees with previous
work (critchley et al, 1993). the lack of statistically significantly reduced glandular or stromal er
staining as the cycle progressed in the current
study is probably due to insufficient subject
numbers. trends towards reduced er staining in
the secretory phase were apparent, however.
the correlation between vegf immunoreactivity in the glands and stroma, suggests a similarity
in regulation, although the variation in the glands
is more pronounced. the relationship between
glandular er and glandular pr is reflected by
similar regulation of each receptor by oestrogen
and progesterone, i.e. oestrogen alone up-regulates
er and pr, whereas progesterone down-regulates
er and pr. the negative correlation between
glandular vegf and glandular pr is of interest
since this is consistent with the hypothesis that
endometrial glandular vegf is regulated by progesterone in vivo in the normal human adult. the
finding that progesterone increases expression of
the most abundant forms of vegf in the uterus of
immature rats is also consistent with this hypothesis
(cullinan-bove and koos, 1993). these data are
also consistent with our observation that local
treatment with a gestogen increases vegf level.
the correlation between stromal vegf staining
and endothelial cell density has not been previously
reported. this has been investigated by others
(gargett et al, 1999) who found no correlation.
this suggests that more work, with larger subject
numbers, is required to investigate this interesting
relationship further. as an angiogenic factor, it
seems probable that vegf could influence endometrial vascular density. in tumours, microvessel
density has been used as a measure of tumour
angiogenesis, with increased intratumoral micro-

observation in itself is unremarkable; what is of
more interest is the high average frequency of
macrophages in the levonorgestrel-treated tissue.
further studies in which specific staining for
macrophages is carried out using endometrial tissue
exposed to other contraceptive steroids would
determine whether this is a common occurrence
following such treatment
in conclusion, the present study shows that
immunoreactive vegf increases significantly in
the glands of the endometrium during the normal
menstrual cycle, while immunoreactive pr
decreases. this study also shows that implanon
and mircette significantly reduce glandular vegf
staining. this is not associated with changes in
endothelial cell density, bleeding pattern, or histological category of the endometrium. stromal staining for vegf correlated positively with endothelial
cell density although neither parameter changed
significantly throughout the menstrual cycle, or
influenced the endometrial bleeding pattern. however, the precise role of progesterone in controlling
glandular vegf is complicated by the fact that
long-term local treatment causes both the epithelial
cells to remain immunopositive for vegf and
decidualized stromal cells to stain very intensely.
it is likely that understanding the down-regulation
(or otherwise) of the pr under these conditions
may offer an explanation for this.

showed any significant differences with vegf, er
or pr staining, or endothelial cell density.
the lack of change in endothelial cell density
with the two contraceptives used in this study
contrasts with the action of three other contraceptives, for example, norplant (an implant which
releases 80 |j.g/day levonorgestrel), high doses
of  xxxd2751xxx  and medroxypogesterone acetate
(mpa). norplant results in significantly increased
microvascular and endothelial cell density compared to that seen during the normal cycle (despite
significantly reduced endothelial cell proliferation),
probably due either to increased regression of
tissue surrounding the endometrial vessels, or a
reduced rate of endothelial cell death [rogers et al.,
1993; goodger (macpherson) et al, 1994]. the
increased vascular density did not seem to be
directly related to increased endometrial bleeding.
on the other hand, treatment with higher doses of
 xxxd2751xxx  or mpa resulted in a significantly
decreased endometrial vascular density (song
et al., 1995). none of these studies, however,
investigated vegf immunoreactivity. another
study investigating endometrial microvascular density in various conditions of atrophy found no
differences compared to endometrium removed
from normally cycling women (hickey et al.,
1996). the present study confirms the apparent
dissociation between endometrial endothelial cell
density and endometrial bleeding. it has also been
proposed that there may be considerable endometrial microvascular heterogeneity, particularly in
response to norplant treatment resulting in focal
bleeding sites (rogers, 1996; rogers et al., 1998).
the same may be true with other steroid treatments.
in this study we also carried out vegf immunostaining of endometrium from patients who had
been treated with levonorgestrel from an iud.
these samples showed very strong staining in the
decidualized stromal cells as well as the uterine
epithelial cells. the latter stained strongly despite
the pronounced thinning of the epithelial layer. we
also observed strong staining in cd68 + cells within
this tissue. the distribution of the macrophages was
extremely heterogeneous and due to the paucity of
tissue in many specimens accurate quantitation of
their number was not attempted. macrophages are
a well-known source of vegf and therefore this
