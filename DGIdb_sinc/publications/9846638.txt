1 cho cells expressing the a1c- xxxg220xxx  (cardiac isoform) and the a1c-b subunit (vascular isoform) of
the voltage-dependent l-type ca2+ channel were used to investigate whether tissue selectivity of ca2+
channel blockers could be related to dierent anities for a1c isoforms.
2 inward current evoked by the transfected a1 subunit was recorded by the patch-clamp technique in
the whole-cell con®guration.
3 neutral dihydropyridines (nifedipine,  xxxd2734xxx , (+)-pn200-110) were more potent inhibitors of a1c-bsubunit than of a1c-a-subunit. this dierence was more marked at a holding potential of 7100 mv than at
750 mv. sdz 207-180 (an ionized dihydropyridine) exhibited the same potency on the two isoforms.
4 pinaverium (ionized non-dihydropyridine derivative) was 2 and 4 fold more potent on a1c-a than on
a1c-b subunit at vh of 7100 mv and 750 mv, respectively. eects of verapamil were identical on the
two isoforms at both voltages.
5 [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding experiments showed that neutral dihydropyridines had a higher anity
for the a1c-b than for the a1c- xxxg220xxx . sdz 207-180 had the same anity for the two isoforms and
pinaverium had a higher anity for the a1c- xxxg220xxx  than for the a1c-b subunit.
6 these results indicate marked dierences among ca2+ channel blockers in their selectivity for the
a1c-a and a1c-b subunits of the ca2+ channel.

introduction
tissue selectivity constitutes the main guideline for the
development of new generations of ca2+ channel blockers. it
determines the therapeutic indications of the molecule and its
counter-indications. the more studied is the vascular versus
cardiac selectivity, for which great dierences between drugs
are reported (spedding et al., 1990; godfraind et al., 1992; sun
& triggle, 1995). extensive in vivo and in vitro studies have
shown that tissue selectivity may be related to several factors,
including physicochemical properties of the drug and
electrophysiological characteristics of the tissue (wibo, 1989).
recently, molecular biology studies have identi®ed several
isoforms of the a1 subunit of the l-type ca2+ channel, issued
from dierent genes and produced by various splicing
processes (perez-reyes & schneider, 1995). their relative
expression is tissue-dependent and is regulated with development (feron et al., 1994).
two transcripts coding for the is6 segment of the a1c-a
subunit and for the is6 segment of the a1c-b subunit, have been
shown to be selectively expressed in cardiac and vascular
smooth muscle, respectively (welling et al., 1997). interestingly,  xxxd2734xxx , a dihydropyridine (dhp) ca2+ channel
blocker with a high vascular selectivity (godfraind et al.,
1992), is a more potent blocker of inward current in cells
transfected with a1c-b isoform cdna than in those transfected
with a1c-a isoform cdna (welling et al., 1993). these results

suggest that vascular versus cardiac selectivity of  xxxd2734xxx 
could be related to the tissue-speci®c expression of isoforms of
the a1c gene. however, there is as yet no evidence that this
property is shared by other dhp and non-dhp ca2+ channel
blockers in a way that could account for their particular tissue
selectivity.
the aim of the present study was to investigate whether
dierences in the anity of ca2+ channel blockers for
isoforms of the a1 subunit could be involved in their tissue
selectivity. we used chinese hamster ovary cells (cho)
transfected either with cdna encoding for the a1c-a or with
cdna encoding for the a1c-b subunit of the l-type ca2+
channel, issuing respectively from rabbit heart and lung
smooth muscle (welling et al., 1993). the ca2+ channel
blocking activity of three neutral dhp derivatives, (+)-pn
200-110, nifedipine and  xxxd2734xxx , which show dierent
degrees of vascular selectivity (godfraind et al., 1992), and one
positively charged derivative sdz 207-180 (kass et al., 1991)
was compared to that of the phenylalkylamine verapamil,
which is equipotent in cardiac and vascular tissue (sun &
triggle, 1995), and to that of pinaverium bromide, a nondhp compound with a quaternary ammonium, reported to
show intestinal selectivity (christen, 1990). the voltagedependent current mediated by the a1 subunit of the l-type
ca2+ channel (ia1) was recorded with the whole-cell
con®guration of the patch-clamp technique using barium ions
as charge carrier. binding anity of ca2+ channel blockers
was also assessed in displacement studies using the ca2+
channel ligand [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110.
results indicate that dierent anity for isoforms of the
a1c- xxxg220xxx  may only account for a part of the selectivity of
the ca2+ channel blockers identi®ed in whole tissues. some of
the results have been presented to the belgian society for

methods
cells
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells transfected with the a1c-a
(cho-a) or with the a1c-b (cho-b) subunit of the l-type
ca2+ channel (welling et al., 1993) were used. cho-a cells
were sub cultured using nutrient mixture ham's f-12 (gibco,
life technologies, ghent, belgium) supplemented with
streptomycin, penicillin,  xxxd2191xxx  and foetal calf serum.
cho-b cells were sub cultured using dulbecco's modi®ed
eagle medium (gibco, life technologies, ghent, belgium)
supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and foetal calf
serum. cells were used 2 days after plating.

electrophysiology
transmembrane currents were recorded at room temperature
with the whole-cell con®guration of the patch-clamp method
(hamill et al., 1981) using the list epc-7 patch-clamp
ampli®er and pclamp software (axon instrument) as
previously described (buryi et al., 1995). the bath was
continuously superfused with solution consisting of (mm):
nacl, 120; bacl2, 10; mgcl2, 1.2; glucose, 10, hepes (n-[2hydroxyethyl]piperazine-n'-[2-ethanesulphonic acid]), 10; ph
adjusted to 7.4 with naoh. patch pipettes had resistances of
3 ± 5 mo. the internal pipette solution contained (mm): nacl,
120; mgcl2, 4; na2atp, 5; glucose, 10; hepes, 10; egta
(ethylene glycol-bis (b-aminoethyl ether), n, n, n', n'-tetraacetic acid), 3; ph adjusted to 7.2 with naoh. substitution of
k+ by na+ in both the pipette and external solutions set the
reversal potential of na+ and cl7 close to 0 mv. for this
reason the test voltage of current measurement was set at
0 mv. control experiments with 1 mm tetrodotoxin added to
the bath solution showed no contribution of na+ channel
current in these cells.

[3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding experiments
[3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding was measured in cho cells
plated in 35 mm dishes and incubated in dme medium
(dulbecco's modi®ed eagle's, life technology) containing
5 mm or 50 mm kcl. cells were incubated for 90 min at 378c
without serum in the presence of [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110
(75 ci mmol71) and various concentrations of unlabelled
competitor. non-speci®c binding was determined in the
presence of nifedipine 1 mm, and subtracted from the total
binding to obtain the speci®c binding. reaction was stopped
by washing the cells with a solution containing nacl, 0.9%;
dmso, 5%; and bovine  xxxg124xxx , 1%. cells were
solubilized in 1 ml sodium dodecylsulphate 0.2% and the
radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. protein was
determined according to lowry et al. (1951).

drugs
nifedipine (sigma),  xxxd2734xxx  (bayer ag, leverkussen,
germany), (+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 (sandoz, basel, switzerland) and
sdz 207-180 (sandoz, basel, switzerland) were dissolved in
ethanol as 1 mm stock solution and diluted in bath solution
immediately before use. [3h]-(+) xxxd2405xxx -110 (75 ci mmol71)
was from dupont nen research products brussels, belgium.

molecular selectivity of ca2+ channel blockers

experiments with dhps were always carried out under yellow
light to prevent photo-inactivation. verapamil hydrochloride
(sigma) and pinaverium bromide (4-(2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-4-[2-{2(6,6 - dimethylnorpinan - 2 - yl) ethoxy} ethyl]
morpholinium bromide, solvay pharma france, paris, france)
were dissolved in water as 10 mm stock solution.

in binding experiments, saturation isotherms were analysed
by scatchard and hill plots. the dissociation constants and the
maximum binding capacity were calculated by linear regression. displacement curves were analysed by a sigmoid curve
®tting programme (munson & rodbard, 1980). an interactive
technique gave estimate of the concentration of competitor
inhibiting 50% of the speci®c binding. the inhibitory constant
(kinh) values were calculated according to cheng & pruso
(1973).
data are expressed as mean+s.e.mean. tests of signi®cance

n. morel et al

a1c-b-subunit (cho-b) of the l-type ca2+ channel was of
maximal amplitude between 0 and 10 mv and inactivated
when holding potential was set positive to 7100 mv. the
standardized protocol that was used to assess the inhibition of
ia1 by the dierent antagonists consisted of recording the
current elicited by 25 ms depolarizing pulses to 0 mv applied
every 10 s from a holding potential of 7100 mv (control
condition) (figure 1). the holding potential was thereafter set
to 750 mv leading to a slowly developing partial inactivation
of the current. at steady state, non-inactivated current was
63.6+1.6% (n=54) and 63.5+1.3% (n=54) of control
current in cho-a and cho-b cells, respectively. holding
potential was then reset to 7100 mv and the ca2+ channel
blocker was introduced in the perfusion solution when the
current had completely recovered from inactivation. the same
protocol was then applied in the continuous presence of the
ca2+ channel blocker.
all the compounds tested blocked ia1 elicited from a holding
potential of 7100 mv in a dose-dependent manner (figure 2).
dissociation constants (k7100 mv) are reported in table 1. the
neutral dhp derivatives  xxxd2734xxx , nifedipine and (+)-pn
200-110 were respectively 4, 5 and 7 fold more potent
inhibitors of ia1 in cho-b compared to cho-a cells, while
no dierence was noted in the potency of sdz 207-180 (a/b
ratio of k7100 mv was 0.9). pinaverium showed a higher
potency in cho-a compared to cho-b cells (a/b ratio of
k7100 mv was 0.5, p50.01). verapamil was equipotent on the
two isoforms.

inhibition of a1 subunit current by ca2+ channel blockers
at a holding potential of 750 mv
since the action of most ca2+ channel blockers is voltagedependent (meâry et al., 1996), the inhibition of ia1 was also
tested at a vh of 750 mv. the dhps concentration-eect
curves determined at 750 mv were shifted to lower
concentrations compared to the curves obtained at 7100 mv.
values of the dissociation constants (k750 mv) are reported in
table 1. among neutral dhps, the voltage-dependent increase
in potency was the largest in cho-a cells with (+)-pn 200110, with a ratio of k7100 mv on k750 mv equal to 18. the
k7100 mv/k750 mv ratio was 7 and 6 for nifedipine and
 xxxd2734xxx , respectively. for these molecules the voltagedependence was less pronounced in cho-b cells than in choa cells, with k7100 mv/k750 mv ratios in cho-b cells between 5
((+)- xxxd2405xxx -110) and 2.5 (nifedipine). voltage-dependence
was similar with sdz 207-180 (k7100 mv/k750 mv ratio was 4.5
in cho-a cells and 3 in cho-b cells). the inhibition of ia1 by
pinaverium was also voltage-dependent; its inhibitory potency
was increased by a factor of 5 and 2, in cho-a and cho-b
cells, respectively. verapamil was markedly more potent at a
holding potential of 750 mv compared to 7100 mv, with a
30 fold and a 24 fold decrease of the k value when holding
potential was depolarized from 7100 mv to 750 mv, in
cho-a and in cho-b cells, respectively.
as was observed at a vh of 7100 mv, there was no
signi®cant dierence between cho-a cells and cho-b cells at

750 mv in the inhibitory potency of the charged dhp sdz
207-180 while the neutral dhps were signi®cantly more potent
in cho-b cells compared to cho-a cells. however, the
dierence in the potency of dhps between cho-a and chob cells was less pronounced at 750 mv than at 7100 mv: a/b
ratios of k750 mv were about 2. conversely, pinaverium was
more potent in cho-a than in cho-b cells: the a/b ratio of

k750 mv was equal to 0.25 suggesting that the dierence in
anity was larger at 750 mv than at 7100 mv. for
verapamil, no dierence was noted between cho-a and
cho-b cells.
the values of the dissociation constant for the inactivated
state of the channel (ki), calculated from equation [2], are
reported in table 1, taking the k7100 mv value as the

four to ten determinations. curves were drawn according to equation [1].

k7100 mv and k750 mv are the dissociation constants obtained from the inhibition of the ca2+ channel current at holding potential of

dissociation constant for the resting state of the channel (kr).
ki a/b ratios of about 2 were obtained for dhps. ki values of
sdz 207-180 and of verapamil were similar in cho-a and in
cho-b cells. on the other hand, the ki value of pinaverium
was 5.5 times higher in cho-b than in cho-a cells (p50.01).

eect of ca2+ channel blockers on the steady state
voltage-dependent inactivation of a1 subunit current
steady state inactivation of ia1 was measured after applying
conditioning potential varying from 7100 mv to 710 mv for
90 s. half maximal inactivation was observed at
745.5+0.3 mv (n=5 cells) and 744.5+1.2 mv (n=5 cells),
in cho-a and cho-b cells, respectively. the eect of the
ca2+ channel blockers on the availability curve was
determined after equilibration of the cell in the presence of
the drug at a holding potential of 7100 mv. in the presence of
a ca2+ channel blocker, the steady state availability curve of
ia1 was shifted to more negative potentials as indicated by the
change in the voltage of half-inactivation, v0.5 (table 2). slope
factor was slightly higher but this dierence did not reach
statistical signi®cance. the shift in the availability curve
allowed to estimate the value of kr and of ki of the blocker
(bean, 1983). those values are reported in table 2. they were
similar to the values calculated from the concentrationdependent inhibition of the current reported in table 1.

eect of ca2+ channel blockers on the current-voltage
relationship of a1 subunit current in cho-a and cho-b
cells
i-v curves were established by applying pulses to voltages
varying from 780 to +50 mv from a holding potential of
7100 mv. in both cho-a and cho-b cells, none of the
blockers tested changed the position of the maximum of the iv relation and the threshold potential of the activation of the
current. figure 3 shows a representative experiment where the
eect of  xxxd2734xxx  on the i-v curve was recorded. similar
results were obtained with the other ca2+ channel blockers.

cho cells. the experiments were performed in medium

containing either 5 mm kcl (physiological medium) or 50 mm
kcl (depolarizing medium). no detectable speci®c binding of
[3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 was identi®ed in non-transfected cells. in
transfected cells the non-speci®c binding of [3h]-(+)-pn 200110 amounted to 10 ± 20% of the total binding. binding
parameters were calculated from displacement curves using
increasing concentration of the unlabelled ligand. incubation
of the cells in depolarizing medium containing 50 mm kcl
decreased the dissociation constant of [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -100
(table 3) without aecting the maximum binding capacity
(cho-a: 84.7+3.5 fmol mg71 protein in 50 mm kcl compared to 106.0+16.7 fmol mg71 protein in 5 mm kcl; chob: 127.0+4.6 fmol mg71 protein in 50 mm kcl compared to
157.0+24.6 fmol mg71 protein in 5 mm kcl; mean values
from three independent determinations). higher binding
capacity of [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 in cho-b than in cho-a
cells probably re¯ects variation in the transfection eciency.
table 3 reports the values of the inhibition constants (kinh)
of dierent ca2+ channel blockers derived from the
concentration for half maximal inhibition of the speci®c
binding of [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 measured in cho-a and
cho-b cells incubated in physiological medium (kcl 5 mm)
(figure 4).  xxxd2734xxx  and nifedipine exhibited a higher
anity (lower kinh) for the recombinant a1c-b than for the a1c-a
subunit. inhibition of [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding by sdz
207-180 was not signi®cantly dierent between cho-a and
cho-b cells. the non-dhp compound pinaverium also
displaced [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 speci®c binding. contrary to
dhps, pinaverium was more potent in cho-a than in chob cells (table 3).

discussion
results showed marked dierences between ca2+ channel
blockers in their respective anity for the a1c-a and a1c-b
subunit of the l-type ca2+ channel. the a1 subunits expressed
in cho cells were isolated from rabbit heart and lung smooth
muscle (welling et al., 1993; bosse et al., 1992) and are splicing
products from the same gene (cach 2, a1c) (biel et al., 1991).
in agreement with the previous report (welling et al., 1992), we
did not note signi®cant dierence between the two isoforms in
terms of functional characteristics: such as kinetics and
voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation. both a1
subunits were sensitive to the ca2+ channel blockers. the
potency of the drugs tested was in the order  xxxd2734xxx  4(+)-

with functional and binding studies in isolated tissues or in
isolated cells (morel & godfraind, 1987, 1991; kokubun et al.,

reduction in ic50 or in dissociation constant is reported when
the membrane potential is changed from 780 mv to 740/

were observed in the present study were in that range, although
voltage-dependence of  xxxd2734xxx  (k7100 mv/k750 mv ratio of
7, or kr/ki ratio of about 10) appeared lower than that
reported in cardiac cells where a 1000 fold increase in anity
with channel inactivation has been observed (sanguinetti &
kass, 1984). with all dhp derivatives used the increase in
anity with channel inactivation was larger with the a1c-a
subunit (13 ± 37 fold increase) than with the a1c-b subunit (6 ±
12 fold increase). the most voltage-dependent compound was
(+)- xxxd2405xxx -100. voltage-dependence was con®rmed by the
shift in the availability curves.

n. morel et al

 xxxd2734xxx  has been shown to be a more potent blocker of
the ca2+ channel activity expressed by transfection of the a1c-b
cdna than of channel activity expressed by transfection of the
a1c-a cdna (welling et al., 1993). the present results showed
that the higher anity of  xxxd2734xxx  for the a1c-b subunit was
shared by the neutral dhp derivatives nifedipine and (+)-pn
200-110, but not by the ionized derivative sdz 207-180. the
isoform selectivity of neutral dhps was voltage-dependent:
the 4 ± 7 fold dierence in dissociation constant at hyperpolarized potentials, which re¯ects the binding to the resting state of
the channel, was reduced to a 2 fold dierence at inactivated
state of the channel. a similar observation was reported with
(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 in natural splice variants of the human
®broblast a1c subunit of the l-type ca2+ channel (soldatov et
al., 1995). it is also in agreement with the comparison of dhp
action on calcium currents in rat mesenteric artery and cardiac
cells indicating a 2 ± 3 fold higher binding of  xxxd2737xxx  to the
resting state of the smooth muscle channel, although its
binding to the inactivated state of the channel is very similar in
cardiac and mesenteric artery cells (bean et al., 1986). in
contrast to neutral dhp derivatives, the permanently charged
dhp sdz 207-180 did not display signi®cant isoform
selectivity. the important role played by the positive charge
present in ionized dhp molecules has been underlined by
bangalore et al. (1994). it may be hypothesized that the
positive charge anchors the molecule in the membrane in such
a position that it is less aected by the conformational
dierence existing between the a1c-a and the a1c-b subunits.

pinaverium
the non-dhp positively charged derivative pinaverium
interacts competitively with [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding
(feron et al., 1992). blockade by pinaverium of the ca2+
channel current mediated by the a1c-a as well as the a1c-b
subunit was voltage-dependent. very little shift in the
availability curve has been reported with pinaverium in
smooth muscle cells from the longitudinal muscle of the rabbit
jejunum when 10 s conditioning pulses were used (beech et al.,
1990). however we noted that, using 90 s conditioning pulses,
the availability curve was signi®cantly shifted towards more
negative values of potential. since pinaverium blockade is not
use-dependent (beech et al., 1990), this shift re¯ects the
voltage-dependence of the action of pinaverium. an important
dierence between pinaverium and dhp was noted in the
present study in their opposite anity ratio for the a1c-a and
a1c-b subunits of the ca2+ channel. moreover, while the anity
ratio of dhps was higher at hyperpolarized potentials,
pinaverium more strongly discriminated between the two
isoforms of the a1 subunit at depolarized potentials.

verapamil
ia1 block by verapamil was markedly voltage-dependent, in
agreement with the voltage-dependent block of the native ca2+
channel (sanguinetti & kass, 1984). in contrast to neutral
dhps and pinaverium, verapamil potency was not aected by
the changes in the molecular structure of the a1 subunit evoked
by the transfection of the cells with a1c-a and a1c-b cdna. since
verapamil is positively charged at physiological ph, further
experiments with more compounds will be necessary to
determine whether the absence of isoform selectivity of
verapamil is related to its positive charge or to a dierent
susceptibility of the phenylalkylamine binding site to the
amino acid variations existing between the a1c-a and the a1c-b
subunits.

molecular selectivity of ca2+ channel blockers

1011

relation to tissue selectivity of ca2+ channel blockers
could the dierent anities of ca2+ channel blockers for the
isoforms of the a1-protein be involved in the tissue selectivity
of these drugs? on the basis of extensive in vitro studies,
 xxxd2734xxx  appears to be the most vascular selective dhp
with a ratio ic50 heart/ic50 vessels of about 1000, followed by
(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 (ratio of about 100) and nifedipine (ratio of
about 10) while verapamil and diltiazem are equipotent in
vascular and cardiac tissues (godfraind et al., 1992; zheng et
al., 1992; sun & triggle, 1995). the pharmacological
approach that was followed in the present study con®rmed
the higher anity of  xxxd2734xxx  for the a1c-b isoform
compared to the a1c-a isoform (welling et al., 1993) and
extended this property to other neutral dhps whereas
verapamil was equiactive on both a1c-a and a1c-b isoforms.
the last observation indicates that absence of selectivity could
be related to absence of dierence in the anity for the a1c-a
and a1c-b isoforms. on the other hand, the largest ratio of
dhp potency between a1c-b and a1c-a subunits was about 7.
this ratio is increased when the dierence in resting potentials
of cardiac and vascular cells is taken into account: the anity
of dhp in the heart would indeed be well re¯ected by the
anity constant at 7100 mv, while the anity in smooth
muscle would be best re¯ected by the anity constant at
750 mv. the comparison of the concentration-eect curves
obtained at 7100 mv with cells expressing the a1c-a and at
750 mv with cells expressing the a1c-b proteins showed that
the ratio of dhp potency was of 26, 13 and 15 for (+)-pn
200-110, nifedipine and  xxxd2734xxx , respectively. this value is
close to the vascular selectivity of nifedipine, but it is far from
the heart/vessel ic50 ratio observed with  xxxd2734xxx  or (+) xxxd2405xxx -110 in functional studies. moreover, no marked
dierence was noted among the dhp derivatives while
signi®cant dierences in the tissue selectivity, covering a 30 ±
100 fold range, are apparent in the dhp series and have been
reported by several authors (sun & triggle, 1995). thus, the
high vascular selectivity of  xxxd2734xxx  compared to nifedipine
can be better predicted considering both the kinetic
parameters of the binding of dhps (wibo et al., 1988), the
voltage-dependence of their binding and eect (morel &
godfraind, 1987, 1991; sun & triggle, 1995) and the
electrophysiological characteristics of the tissue, in particular
the pattern of the stimulation (godfraind et al., 1992; wibo,
1989). additionally, the role of the auxiliary subunits of the
ca2+ channel in the sensitivity to the blockers may not be
neglected (wei et al., 1995). nevertheless, the particular
behaviour of pinaverium, with a higher potency against the
a1c-a splice variant, could account for its typical pharmacological pro®le and could explain the selective inhibition of
calcium-induced contraction of the intestine by this compound
(szekeres & papp, 1989) and its interesting eect in the
treatment of the hypermotility of intestinal smooth muscle
(christen, 1990) since a large proportion of the a1c-a isoform
has been found in this tissue (feron et al., 1994).
in conclusion, the present results show important dierences between ca2+ channel blockers in anity ratio for the
a1c-b and a1c-a subunits of the l-type voltage-dependent ca2+
channel. anity ratio was not only function of the chemical
family of the blocker, but was also in¯uenced by the ionization
of the molecule. the absence of isoform selectivity of the
phenylalkylamine verapamil and the higher anity of
pinaverium for the a1c-a isoform were in agreement with organ
bath and in vivo data. on the other hand, the a1c-b/a1c-a anity
ratio of neutral dhp was found to poorly correlate with their
degree of vascular versus cardiac selectivity.
