abstract
the case report of a 2 year old boy with steroid
refractory dba, treated with allogeneic pbsct from an
hla matched sibling is presented. anti- xxxg1173xxx  receptor antibody  xxxd1798xxx  was used as a prophylaxis for graft versus
host disease (gvhd). complete recovery without any evidence of gvhd ensued.

introduction
diamond blackfan anaemia (dba) is an early onset
pure red cell aplasia characterized by macrocytosis, reticulocytopenia and marrow erythroblastopenia. corticosteroid
is the first line therapy in the treatment of diamond
blackfan anaemia but 50% cases are steroid refractory; allogeneic pbsct is a curative treatment.

antibody  xxxd1798xxx  was given on day 0. this regimen was
well tolerated by the patient. patient developed febrile neutropenia on day +4 which responded to empirical antibiotics. the platelets never dropped below 20 x 109/l.
neutrophils were engrafted on day +9. patient was discharged from hospital on day +19. immunosuppressive
therapy was withdrawn gradually after six months. patient
has been in excellent clinical condition 2 Â½ years post transplant, maintaining his haemoglobin with normal
haematopoiesis. details of peripheral blood counts and
engraftment are given in table.

case report
a 2 months old boy presented with features of severe
anaemia. there was no family history of haemoglobinopathy or any other blood disorder. laboratory investigations
showed haemoglobin of 3.5gm/dl and slightly raised mean
cell volume. peripheral blood film showed normochromic
and macrocytic rbc. uncorrected reticulocyte count was
0.5%. bone marrow biopsy exhibited marked erythroblastopenia in an otherwise normocellular marrow. a diagnosis of dba was established. oral prednisolone was started
at 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months but there was no response to
therapy, and patient remained transfusion dependent.
parents were counselled for allogeneic pbsct. his elder
brother was hla identical; transplant was done when the
child was 20 months old. conditioning therapy consisted of
oral  xxxd390xxx  3.5 mg/kg body weight/day for 4 days and
injection cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day for 4 days.
donor stem cells were mobilized with subcutaneous rhg csf at a dose of 10 g/kg/day for 4 days and on day 0 stem
cells were harvested using mcs+ cell separator
(haemonetics usa). the dose of mononuclear cells was
6.2x108/kg body weight of the recipient. acute gvhd prophylaxis given in a form of oral cyclosporin 5 mg/kg/day
started from day-4, oral methotrexate 10 mg/m2 on day +1,
3, 6, 11 and then weekly.  xxxg1173xxx  receptor blocking

discussion
efficacy of  xxxd1798xxx  as a prophylaxis of gvhd has
not been tested in dba or other indications. response rates of
29% and 47% have been reported in steroid resistant acute
gvhd, using two different time schedules of antibody administration respectively.1,2 in this case of steroid refractory dba,
 xxxd1798xxx  proved useful in preventing acute gvhd and
cgvhd. this was the first case of dba which received
 xxxd1798xxx  in allogeneic pbsct and recovered completely.
acute graft versus host disease is one of the most common
causes of transplant related mortality. cyclosporin,
methotrexate and steroids are used for its prophylaxis but
once it develops it has significant morbidity and mortality.
anti-thymocyte globulin (atg) and more recently, anti- xxxg1173xxx 
receptor antibodies  xxxd1798xxx  have been used in steroid
refractory acute gvhd for its treatment. although atg is in
use for matched unrelated donor transplant gvhd prophylaxis,  xxxd1798xxx  has not been tried in this setting.
first successful bone marrow transplant in dba was
reported in 1976 in a 13 year old boy.3 the patient died due

to interstitial pneumonia on day +55 but the haematopoietic
engraftment confirmed that the dba is a transplantable disorder. since then over a hundred bone marrow transplants
have been reported in literature. international bone marrow
transplant registry, french registry and dba registry reported a series of 10, 13 and 20 patients respectively.4-7 in hla
identical sibling donor transplant, 72-87.5% 2 year or a 5
year probability of survival was seen while in unrelated
matched setting the outcome was extremely poor. main
causes of transplant failure were acute gvhd, relapse of
dba and infections.

conclusion
in steroid refractory dba, we suggest an early decision of transplant before iron overload induced end-organ
damage and transfusion transmitted viral infections complicate the picture. newer approaches of prevention of gvhd
e.g.  xxxd1798xxx  need to be tested to improve the outcome
