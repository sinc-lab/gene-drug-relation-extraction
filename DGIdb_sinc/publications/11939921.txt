background: we have previously found that agents increasing
intracellular camp levels of smooth muscles, such as  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors,  xxxd150xxx  and  xxxd124xxx , produce both
bronchodilation and pulmonary vasodilation in serotonin-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction
models. in the present study we have simultaneously evaluated
the spasmolytic effects of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate, a novel  xxxd1742xxx 
derivative, on serotonin-induced pulmonary hypertension and
bronchoconstriction.
methods: ten mongrel dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital. the pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction were
elicited with serotonin (10 mg/kg pi 1 mg¡kgª1¡hª1) and assessed
as percentage changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr)
and bronchial cross-sectional area (bca) (basal omega 100%). initially, the relaxant effects of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate (0–300 mg/kg)
were determined. the pvr and bca were assessed before and
30 min after serotonin infusion began and 5 min after each dose
of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate. to determine whether  xxxd1742xxx  daropateinduced relaxation is independent of plasma catecholamine,
propranolol 0.4 mg/kg was given following  xxxd1742xxx  daropate
300 mg/kg i.v.

results:  xxxd1742xxx  daropate reversed both pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction dose-dependently: -loged50 (95%
confidence intervals, mean ed50) for pulmonary hypertension
and bronchoconstriction 5.44 (5.08–5.80, 3.6 mg/kg) and 4.90
(4.06–5.20, 12.5 mg/kg), respectively. however,  xxxd1742xxx  daropate (ⱖ 30 mg/kg) produced a more pronounced systemic than
pulmonary vasodilation. although  xxxd1742xxx  daropate (ⱖ 30 mg/
kg) significantly increased plasma catecholamines, propranolol
did not reverse the relaxant effects.
conclusions:  xxxd1742xxx  daropate may attenuate bronchoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension. in addition, as b-blockade
did not change the attenuation, the relaxant effects may be independent of plasma catecholamines.

tracellular camp levels by direct stimulation of
adenylate cyclase, exhibiting a positive inotropic effect (6).  xxxd1742xxx  may be useful in patients showing
tolerance for b-stimulants as its cardiotonic effect is
not mediated via b-adrenoceptors. however, its poor
water solubility has limited clinical use. recently, a
novel water-soluble  xxxd1742xxx  derivative,  xxxd1742xxx  daropate, has been developed. several animal and in vitro studies (7–9) suggest that this agent may be useful
for treatment of heart failure. a multicenter clinical
trial in patients with acute heart failure in japan proposed a dose interval of 0.25–0.75 mg¡kgª1¡minª1 (10,
11). as  xxxd1742xxx  daropate produces vasodilation by
increasing the camp level of vascular smooth
muscles, it has been postulated the spasmolytic effects
would be similar to  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors or  xxxd124xxx .
5ht is a spasmogen for both the pulmonary vasculature (both artery and vein) and the bronchus (12,

with coexisting cardiac disease or reactive
airway diseases sometimes perioperatively suffer
severe circulatory depression or react with bronchospasm caused by inflammation or mechanical stimulation. we have studied the spasmolytic effects of
agents increasing intracellular camp levels, such as
 xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors (1, 2),  xxxd150xxx  (2) and  xxxd124xxx  (3), using a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5ht)-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction model. these agents have a potent
spasmolytic effect in this pulmonary hypertension
model. in addition, the bronchodilating effect of
 xxxd150xxx  may partially result from increased
plasma catecholamines (4, 5).
most cardiotonic agents, such as b-adrenoceptor
agonists and phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors, produce their effects by increasing intracellular camp
level in cardiac myocytes.  xxxd1742xxx  also increases inatients

13). it has been reported that elevated plasma 5ht is
associated with primary pulmonary hypertension (14,
15). in addition, several reports (14, 15) have suggested that some appetite suppressants such as
aminorex and fenfluramine may increase the risk of
primary pulmonary hypertension through interactions with 5ht transporters or activation of 5ht receptors.
the aim of the present study was to determine
whether  xxxd1742xxx  daropate could antagonize 5ht-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction in dogs. in addition, we sought to determine
whether the spasmolytic effects of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate
were altered by b-adrenoceptor blockade, as  xxxd1742xxx 
daropate-induced systemic vasodilation may increase
plasma catecholamines via arterial baroreceptor reflex.

methods
the study protocol was approved by the animal experiment committee of the university of hirosaki
school of medicine.
ten mongrel dogs (8–12 kg) were anesthetized with
pentobarbital 30 mg/kg i.v. anesthesia was then
maintained throughout the experiment with a continuous infusion of pentobarbital 10 mg¡kg1¡hª1 with
0.2 mg¡kgª1¡hª1 pancuronium for muscle relaxation.
the trachea was intubated using a special tracheal
tube (id 7.0 mm; fuji system, tokyo, japan) with an
additional small lumen for insertion of a superfine fiberoptic bronchoscope (od 2.2 mm: af type 22 a,
olympus, tokyo, japan). the lungs were ventilated
with a ventilator (servo 900c, siemens-elema ab, solna, sweden). end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration
was maintained at 4.0–4.5%. a pulmonary artery catheter (thermodilution catheter model 139h 7.5f, baxter
healthcare corporation, ca, irvine, usa) was inserted via the femoral vein through a sheath to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (pap), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) and cardiac output
(co) and to administer 5ht. the femoral artery was
cannulated to monitor systemic arterial pressure and
to draw blood samples. lactate ringer’s solution was
infused at 4 ml¡kgª1¡hª1 and drugs were administered via the pulmonary artery catheter sheath.

analysis of pulmonary artery and airway tone
pulmonary artery and airway tone was assessed by
changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) and
bronchial cross-sectional area as previously reported
(1–3). briefly, pvr was calculated from co, mean pap
(mpap) and pcwp. bronchial cross-sectional area
(bca) at the second–third bifurcation was monitored

continuously using the fiber optic bronchoscope. images were printed using a videoprinter (videoprinter
vy-170, hitachi, tokyo, japan) during the end-expiratory pause, and then measured using a image analyzing software (macscope 2.56, mitani corporation,
fukui, japan). measured pvr and bca were expressed as a percentage of the basal (omega 100%).

experimental protocol
pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction
were elicited with 5ht 10 mg/kg i.v. followed by an
infusion of 1 mg¡kgª1¡hª1 via the pulmonary artery
catheter continuously throughout experiments. thirty
minutes later, when stable pulmonary hypertension
and bronchoconstriction had been achieved, drugs
were administered. we have previously confirmed
that the pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction are stable until the end of experiments (about 2
h) (3). at the end of the experiment, all dogs were
euthanized with a lethal dose of thiopental.
dogs were each given dose of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate,
which was obtained from nippon kayaku co. (tokyo,
japan): 0 (saline), 0.3, 3, 30 and 300 mg/kg i.v., cumulatively. propranolol 0.4 mg/kg was given following the
i.v.  xxxd1742xxx  daropate (300 mg/kg) to determine
whether effects of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate are dependent
on plasma catecholamine. pvr and bca were assessed before and 30 min after the start of 5ht infusion and 5 min after administration of each dose of
 xxxd1742xxx  daropate and propranolol. at least 15 min
elapsed between administration of each dose, although propranolol was given immediately after data
of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate 300 mg/kg were collected.

plasma catecholamine assay
arterial blood (6 ml) was collected through the femoral artery catheter into an edta syringe simultaneously with measurement of pvr and bca. blood
was immediately centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 10 min
at ª10 æc. the plasma was separated and frozen at
ª70 æc until assay. plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were determined by high
performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. the intra-assay coefficients of
variation for epinephrine and norepinephrine were
3.31% and 2.93%, respectively. the lower limits of detection for epinephrine and norepinephrine were 9
pg/ml and 12.5 pg/ml, respectively.

attenuated increase in pvr and bronchial constriction
by half (ed50) were calculated by computer-assisted
curve fitting (graphpad-prism, graphpad software
inc., ca, san diego, usa) from individual curves.
the ratio of percentage pvr to percentage svr was
calculated using the following formula to determine
which vascular smooth muscles  xxxd1742xxx  daropate relax more potently, pulmonary or systemic:
ratio omega (post-cd pvr/pre-cd pvr)/(post-cd
svr/pre-cd svr), post-cd being 5 min after each
dose of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate (cd) i.v., and pre-cd being
30 min after 5ht infusion started and before cd 0
mg/kg (saline) i.v.

results
5-ht infusion increased pvr to 178.2% (128.8–
227.5%) and decreased bca to 50.0% (44.2–55.8%).

the initiation of 5ht infusion (table 1). the ratio of
pvr to svr indicates that doses of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate
above 30 mg/kg produce greater systemic vasodilation
than pulmonary vasodilation (fig. 2). in addition, propranolol significantly reduced this ratio (p ⬍0.05, fig.
2).

discussion
the present study demonstrates that  xxxd1742xxx  daropate attenuates both 5ht-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction in a dose-related
manner. radioligand binding assay has shown that
[14c] xxxd1742xxx  daropate is distributed to lung, heart,
trachea and many other organs with the exception of
the brain (18). moreover,  xxxd1742xxx  has been reported
to produce relaxant effects by increasing intracellular
camp levels in vascular and airway smooth muscles
(9, 19). therefore, it is not surprising that the  xxxd1742xxx 
derivative,  xxxd1742xxx  daropate, antagonized 5ht-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction.
in clinical practice, a clinically relevant concentration of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate (10) may be 10–20 ng/
ml. pharmacokinetic data in dogs (18) suggested that
the plasma concentration of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate 5 min
after 30 mg/kg i.v. was about 17 ng/ml. doses less
than 30 mg/kg of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate, as used in our
study, may be equivalent to those used in clinical situations. the ed50 of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate for percentage
pvr and percentage bca would be within the clinically relevant range.
in this study the spasmolytic effect of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate on pulmonary hypertension is more potent than
that on bronchoconstriction, as the ed50 of  xxxd1742xxx 
daropate for pulmonary vasodilation was significantly lower than that for bronchodilation. we have previously reported that the ed50 of the  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors
milrinone and olprinone producing bronchoconstric-

300

tion was significantly different from that for pulmonary hypertension. silver and colleagues (20) reported
that there is pharmacological and substrate heterogenicity of  xxxg1695xxx  between aortic and tracheal smooth
muscle in the same species, although cardiac and vascular smooth muscle pde isozymes are pharmacologically similar. the differences in relaxant effects of
 xxxd1742xxx  daropate may also be due to the heterogeneity of adenylate cyclase between vascular and airway smooth muscles.
 xxxd1742xxx  daropate (ⱖ 30 mg/kg) stimulated endogenous catecholamine release. this release may result
from baroreceptor reflexes, as  xxxd1742xxx  daropate produces vasodilation but does not affect basal catecholamine release from the adrenal gland (21). sympathetic influence on airway tone is mainly dependent on circulating catecholamines, as direct
sympathetic neural supply in the lung is limited (22).
endogenous catecholamines might thus be involved

relaxant effects of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate

in  xxxd1742xxx  daropate-induced bronchodilation. however, in this study, propranolol did not reverse bronchodilation. therefore, catecholamine release may not
be responsible for  xxxd1742xxx  daropate-induced relaxation.
in the present study, the ratio of percentage pvr to
percentage svr suggests that more than 30 mg/kg of
 xxxd1742xxx  daropate may produce more potent systemic
vasodilation than pulmonary vasodilation. however,
the dose range also significantly increased plasma
catecholamines, especially epinephrine, and b-blockade significantly reduced the ratio. moreover, epinephrine i.v. infusion at 0.1–0.4 mg¡kgª1¡minª1 has been
reported to reduce svr (23). a more pronounced systemic than pulmonary effect of endogenous catecholamine release by the baroreceptor reflex may explain
the greater effect on systemic than on pulmonary vasculature. similar to other pulmonary vasodilators
such as calcium channel blockers, systemic hypotension may limit clinical use of  xxxd1742xxx  daropate. in
addition, clinical reports (10, 11) showed that tachycardia, arrhythmia and hypotension may occur during its infusion, especially at higher infusion rate.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that  xxxd1742xxx 
daropate produces a direct relaxant effect on both pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction
elicited by 5ht infusion. with the higher dose, the
systemic vasodilation was more pronounced than the
pulmonary vasodilation. we suggest that  xxxd1742xxx  daropate may be effective for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction.
