alternatives to unfractioned heparin for
anticoagulation in cardiopulmonary bypass
ludwig k von segesser, x mueller, b marty, j horisberger and a corno department of cardiovascular
surgery, chuv, centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois, lausanne

despite the progress made in the development of cardiopulmonary bypass
(cpb) equipment, systemic anticoagulation with unfractioned heparin and
post-bypass neutralization with protamine are still used in most perfusion
procedures. however, there are a number of situations where unfractioned
heparin, protamine or both cannot be used for various reasons. intolerance
of protamine can be addressed with extracorporeal heparin removal devices,
perfusion with (no) low systemic heparinization and, to some degree, by
perfusion with alternative anticoagulants. various alternative anticoagulation
regimens have been used in cases of intolerance to unfractioned heparin,
including extreme hemodilution, low molecular weight heparins, danaparoid,
ancrod, r-hirudin,  xxxd53xxx ,  xxxd3385xxx , argatoban and others.
in the presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) and
thrombosis, the use of r-hirudin appears to be an acceptable solution which
has been well studied. the main issue with r-hirudin is the difficulty in
monitoring its activity during cpb, despite the fact that ecarin coagulation
time assessment is now available.
a more recent approach is based on selective blockage of platelet
aggregation by means of monoclonal antibodies directed to  xxxg1202xxx /iiia
receptors ( xxxd53xxx ) or the use of a  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitor ( xxxd3385xxx ). an 80%
blockage of the  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptors and suppression of platelet aggregation
to less than 20% allows the giving of unfractioned heparin and running cpb
in a standard fashion despite hit and thrombosis. likewise, at the end of
the procedure, unfractioned heparin is neutralized with protamine as usual
and donor platelets are transfused if necessary.  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitors are
frequently used in interventional cardiology and, therefore, are available in
most hospitals.

introduction
the discovery of heparin by mclean at the beginning
of the last century1 was certainly of prime importance
for the development of cardiopulmonary bypass
(cpb) as such and even more so for the development
of cardiovascular surgery as a whole. however, systemic application of heparin, and the medication
used for its ‘neutralization’, namely protamine, have
their drawbacks. one approach to avoid complications linked to systemic heparin and/or protamine for
procedures with cpb is of course to avoid protamine,
heparin, or cpb per se. if the latter is now of growing interest for coronary artery revascularization by
so-called minimally invasive direct coronary bypass
(midcab) and off-pump coronary artery bypass
(opcab) procedures,2 no similar solutions are currently available in routine open heart surgery for
repair of valvular or congenital diseases.
despite the fact that cpb has been accomplished
in the past without systemic medication for anticoagulation, this approach is rather exceptional and
mainly based on perfusion equipment with modified
surfaces,3 simplified perfusion circuits4 or combinations. at present, routine cpb with heparincoated perfusion equipment has, in general, been
used mainly with low systemic heparinization.5–7
however, in patients with modified coagulation
profiles, such as can occur after trauma and massive fluid resuscitation, cpb without systemic
heparinization or other anticoagulant medication
has also been used successfully in the clinical
setting.8,9
the following review focusses on the various
strategic possibilities for clinical cpb without
heparin and/or protamine.

an elegant method for neutralization of circulating
heparin at the end of cpb is certainly the use
of a heparin-removal device.12 this is based on a
plasmapheresis chamber containing immobilized
polycation. such devices facilitate the removal of
circulating heparin from plasma. despite promising
experimental data, there is only limited clinical
experience13 with such heparin removal devices
until now.
because of the currently limited availability of
heparin-removal devices, we actually approach
patients with known allergic reactions to protamine
by perfusion with low systemic heparinization
in conjunction with tip-to-tip heparin-coated perfusion equipment, as previously reported.14 with
the technique described, a low systemic heparinization dose (loading dose 100 iu/kg bodyweight,
priming dose 1000 iu/l of priming volume) can be
used and the target activated coagulation time
(act: hemochron, international technidyne corp.,
edison, nj) can be kept at 180 s. the suggested
heparinization regimen allows, in general, to be
close to the target act of 180 s after approximately
60 min of cpb. at such low levels of systemic
heparinization, spontaneous heparin clearance in
conjunction with the use of a red cell spinning
device and availability of fresh frozen plasma
(occasionally platelet concentrates), in general,
allows for adequate hemostasis within a reasonable
time frame. we have used this technique under various circumstances to both our and the patient’s satisfaction. in addition, it is also standard practice in
vascular surgery, where similar heparinization regimens are used, not to reverse circulating heparin
in cases with critical distal vascular bed.

problems with heparin
problems with protamine
protamine is known to provoke adverse reactions in
about 10% of patients.10 risk factors for adverse
reactions after protamine include previous cpb,
insulin treatment (protamine is contained in some
preparations), history of fish allergy, prior vasectomy, and others. anaphylactic reactions to protamine are a serious problem; they can be dramatic
and often lethal.11
various techniques to avoid the use of protamine
for neutralization of heparin have been proposed.

the term heparin here stands for unfractioned
heparin as it is used widely for systemic heparinization prior to and during cpb. heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (hit) and thromboses are a
major problem in patients requiring cpb. as mentioned above,2 a significant number of coronary
artery revascularization procedures can now be
performed on the beating heart and this allows
us therefore, to circumvent partially the systemic
heparinization issue. in fact, heparin application
for cpb is not necessary in this event; however,

alternatives to unfractioned heparin for anticoagulation in cpb
crossclamping of the coronary arteries is usually
done with some degree of systemic heparinization,
as in vascular surgery. hence, beating heart surgery
is only a partial solution for patients suffering from
hit. hit and thromboses are heparin-mediated
events based on an immunologic disorder which is
induced by the administration of heparin for therapeutic purposes.15 although the exact mechanism
of this heparin-induced immunologic reaction is not
fully understood, it appears according to aster16
that heparin binds to  xxxg1726xxx  to form an
antigenic haptene on the platelet surface. specific
antibodies are produced which, upon re-exposure
to heparin, react with heparin- xxxg1726xxx 
complexes and circulating platelets. activation of
platelets results in either lysis or agglutination.
although only the latter may induce clinical thrombosis, both result in thrombocytopenia and, eventually, hemorrhagic complications.
a number of strategies have been developed to
realize cpb in patients with hit and thromboses.
as a matter of fact, it is of prime importance for
patients with suspected and/or proven hit and
thromboses to distinguish between those in emergency situations requiring cpb within hours or days
and those who can be operated on electively. for
the latter, the most convenient strategy is to postpone the procedure for 6–8 weeks and to measure
again the level of antibodies. in the absence
of antibodies, standard cpb with full systemic
heparinization is recommended.17,18 if specific
antibodies are still present or if a procedure cannot
be postponed, there is no way around an anticoagulation strategy that either avoids unfractioned
heparin per se, or prevents platelet reactions
despite the use of unfractioned heparin. the main
issues around these alternative treatment strategies
have been reviewed recently by frederikson18 as
well as follis and schmidt17 in a very comprehensive fashion. an update of the now recommended
alternative strategies is given below:
low molecular weight heparins
low molecular weight heparins are prepared from
unfractioned heparin. if the molecular weight of the
latter varies between 5000 and 30 000 daltons, the
respective values are 4500 daltons for  xxxd2690xxx ,
6000 daltons for  xxxd1805xxx , and 4200 daltons
for enoxaparin. all three produce conformational
changes of antithrombin and  xxxg2057xxx 

413

and augment their inhibitory effects on coagulation.
however, they affect factor iia much less than
 xxxg741xxx  compared to unfractioned heparin. the
half-life of low molecular weight heparins injected
intravenously varies between 2 and 4 h compared
to an average half-life of 90 min for unfractioned
heparin.19 there are some reports of cpb with
anticoagulation based on low molecular weight
heparins in the literature. a typical  xxxd1805xxx  loading dose for cpb in patients with hit is 10 000 iu
whereas a typical priming dose is 5000 iu.20
however, the indications for this strategy are, at
this time, unclear. in fact, cross-reactivity in patients
with hit has been reported in up to 90%.21,22
furthermore, cross-reactions with hit antibodies
have also been reported for cpb circuits bonded
with unfractioned heparin.23 as a result, the combination of heparin-bonded circuits with low molecular weight heparins appears not to be the first
choice in patients with hit and thrombosis.
in addition, there is currently no reliable coagulation assay available which allows for monitoring
during cpb with low molecular weight heparins.
finally, protamine can reverse completely the antiiia activity of low molecular weight heparins, but
only uncompletely the anti-xa activity.
danaparoid
danaparoid (orgaran: organon pharmaceuticals,
west orange, nj, usa) is a byproduct of unfractioned heparin production and consists of a mixture
of three heparinoids, namely heparan sulfate (84%),
dermatan sulfate (12%) and  xxxd1687xxx 
(4%). the average molecular weight is 6500 daltons
and the half-life of danaparoid’s anti-xa activity is
25 h whereas it is 7 h for the anti-iia activity. weak
cross-reactivity for danaparoid in patients with hit
and thrombosis antibodies has been demonstrated
in only 17%.22 a typical danaparoid loading dose is
8750 anti-xa u for a priming dose of 7500 anti-xa
u and additional doses of 1500 anti-xa u upon the
appearance of clots in the operating field. the recommended target level to initiate cpb is 2 anti-xa
u/ml.24 the fact that there is only weak crossreactivity in patients with hit and thrombosis21
makes this approach a reasonable one under such
circumstances. danaparoid has an immediate anticoagulant effect similar to unfractioned heparin
and low molecular weight heparins. however,
neither protamine nor any other drug can reverse

lk von segesser et al.

danaparoid’s anticoagulant effects and transfusion
of fresh frozen plasma and platelets only partially
reinstitute coagulation.
ancrod
ancrod (arvin, knoll pharmaceuticals, whippany,
nj, usa) is derived from the venom of the
malayan pit viper (calloselasma rhodostoma).
ancrod cleaves the a-fibrinopeptides, but not the
b-fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen. as a result,
the fibrinmonomers can form end-to-end, but not
end-to-side linkages. the initial half-life of ancrod
is 3–5 h, but becomes prolonged as the concentration decreases because of its clearance through the
reticuloendothelial system (res). by 4 days, 90%
of ancrod is cleared. cpb is possible by ancrodinduced defibrinogenation. for this purpose, lowering the fibrinogen concentration to 0.2–0.8 g/l is
necessary (normal range 2.0–4.0 g/l) by means of
an ancrod infusion for 12 h (1.65  0.55 u/kg).
this approach is recommended to avoid overloading the res.25 act, prothrombin time (pt) and
partial thromboplastin time (aptt) seem not to
be helpful during cpb. fresh frozen plasma (ffp)
or cryoprecipitate will reverse the anticoagulant
effect.
r-hirudin
r-hirudin ( xxxd2455xxx : hoechst marion roussel,
frankfurt, germany) is the recombinantly produced
version of the protein isolated from the saliva of the
medicinal leech (hirudo medicinalis). r-hirudin
blocks the action of iia through direct and specific
1 : 1 binding. it does not require the action or presence of antithrombin,  xxxg2057xxx  or other
plasma cofactor. the anticoagulant effect occurs
immediately. eliminated by the kidneys, its half-life
is between 30 and 60 min. a typical r-hirudin loading dose is 0.25 mg/kg bodyweight with a priming dose
of 0.20 mg/l in order to reach a target level of
2.0 µg/ml.26 additional doses of 2–5 mg/l or a
continuous infusion of approximately 0.5 mg/min
are given throughout cpb. ecarin coagulation time
(ect) seems to reflect r-hirudin concentrations
more accurately than act or aptt.27 the recommended ect target level for cpb is higher than
250–400 s according to the various authors. however, other reports reveal considerable patientto-patient variations in the r-hirudin concentration
indicated by a given ect.28 with its short half-life,

neutralization of circulating r-hirudin is not mandatory. however, hemofiltration is a method of reversal, and recombinant meizothrombin has been
proposed as an antidote.
 xxxd53xxx 
platelet activation involves the expression of
the  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptors on the platelet surface
which, in turn, bind bivalent fibrinogen on adjacent
platelets, thus, forming aggregates. this reaction
can be blocked with the monoclonal antibody
 xxxd53xxx  (reopro: eli lilly (suisse sa), vernier,
ge, switzerland). this drug is widely used in interventional cardiology and has recently also be applied
for cpb in patients with hit and thrombosis.
 xxxd53xxx  is administered as a bolus of 0.25 mg/kg
and then as an infusion of 10 µg/kg/min on induction of anesthesia, resulting in a greater than 80%
blockade of  xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptor and suppression
of platelet aggregation to less than 20% of baseline.29 heparin is then given in the usual fashion and reversed at the end of the procedure.
 xxxd53xxx  is then discontinued and platelet concentrates are transfused for haemostasis.
 xxxd3385xxx 
another group30 has administered, in one case,
the  xxxg1202xxx /iiia inhibitor  xxxd3385xxx  ( xxxd3385xxx :
msd, haar, germany) 10 min before cannulation
for cpb with a bolus infusion of 10 µg/kg bodyweight
and started a continuous infusion of 15 µg/kg/min.
thereafter, the standard bolus of 300 iu of unfractioned heparin was given and the target of the
kaolin act was set as usual at 480 s. no additional
heparin was used during the 150 min pump run and
the  xxxd3385xxx  infusion was stopped approximately
60 min before the end of perfusion. heparin was
reversed totally with protamine.  xxxd187xxx  and fresh
frozen plasma, but no platelets, were transfused
postoperatively.
argatoban
argatoban ( xxxd218xxx : texas biotechnology
corp., houston, tx, usa) is a synthetic thrombin
inhibitor. it inhibits iia by direct 1 : 1 binding to iia’s
catalytic site and does not require the action of
antithrombin. this drug has been found to be a
safe and effective alterative to heparin in a canine
model of cpb31 and there is also limited clinical
experience.32

alternatives to unfractioned heparin for anticoagulation in cpb
other alternatives
a growing number of other alternatives to
unfractioned heparin can be found in the literature
including hirugen, hirulog, thrombin aptamer,  xxxg752xxx  inhibitor, recombinant tick anticoagulant,
vasoflux, pentasaccharide, recombinant nematode
anticoagulant, antitissue factor antibodies, active
site inhibited factor viia, recombinant  xxxg748xxx 
pathway inhibitors and others. however, the relative value of these drugs in the setting of cpb is not
clear yet.
in conclusion, one has to state that, at this time,
there is no anticoagulation regimen for cpb that
matches the ease of use of standard systemic
heparinization based on unfractioned heparin,
controlled by act, and reversed by protamine.
however, there are situations where the preferred
standard solution cannot be used and alternative
regimens have to be considered. if low systemic
heparinization in conjunction with heparin-coated
perfusion equipment, and, if necessary, avoidance of
protamine is not an option as in hit and thrombosis, one of the above mentioned alternative strategies has to be selected. at this time, a reasonable
and well explored alternative strategy appears to be
the use of r-hirudin. nevertheless, blockage of the
 xxxg1202xxx /iiia receptors and suppression of platelet
aggregation followed by unfractioned heparin and
cpb in standard fashion appears to be a very tempting approach, especially as the drugs necessary for
this are widely used in interventional cardiology
and, therefore, available in most hospitals.
