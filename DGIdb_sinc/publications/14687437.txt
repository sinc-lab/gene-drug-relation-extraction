summary

this commentary article provides an overview of
recent clinical research trials involving anastrozole
and its evolving role in the management of breast
cancer.
anti-aromatase agents inhibit the cytochrome
p-450 component of the aromatase enzyme
complex responsible for the final step of estrogen
biosynthesis in peripheral tissues which are the
main source of estrogen in postmenopausal
women. anastrozole is a third-generation nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. it has been shown
to be superior to  xxxd2557xxx  acetate, in terms of
survival and adverse effects, as a second-line
therapy in postmenopausal women with estrogen
receptor (er)- and/or  xxxg1737xxx 
(pgr)-positive advanced breast cancer. phase iii
clinical trials have also demonstrated that
anastrozole significantly prolongs the time to
tumour progression compared with tamoxifen as
a first-line therapy for er- and/or pgr-positive
advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal

introduction
estrogen plays a significant role in the development and
growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer1,2. the
principal sites of estrogen biosynthesis in postmenopausal women include skin, muscle, fat, and
benign and malignant breast tissue3–5. the aromatase
enzyme complex in such tissues converts androgens

women. furthermore, the preliminary results of
the arimidex*, tamoxifen, alone and in
combination (atac) study have shown that
adjuvant anastrozole is superior to tamoxifen in
terms of disease-free survival (dfs), nonmusculoskeletal adverse effects and prevention of
contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal
women with early, er-positive breast cancer.
although longer follow-up is required to assess
the long-term effects of anastrozole on bone
mineral density, cognitive function and overall
survival, the drug has been recently approved for
adjuvant use in postmenopausal women with
early, er-positive breast cancer who are unable
to tolerate tamoxifen or at an increased risk of
developing thromboembolism or endometrial
cancer.

neoadjuvant setting, the management of dcis,
premenopausal breast cancer and breast cancer
prevention is currently being investigated.

(c19 steroids) into estrogen (a c18 steroid). the
conversion process of adrenal androstenedione to
estrone by aromatase is related to body weight6. in
normal-weight subjects, approximately 1% of androstenedione is converted to estrone, whereas in obese
subjects this increases up to 10%. the increase in
peripheral estrogen synthesis with weight in
postmenopausal women is the most likely explanation

for the increased risk of breast cancer observed in obese
postmenopausal women6. aromatase activity also
increases with age7. aromatase inhibition has therefore
become an important therapeutic modality for
hormone-sensitive breast cancer in postmenopausal
patients2. anti-aromatase agents such as anastrozole
inhibit the cytochrome p-450 component of the
aromatase enzyme complex by interfering with the
electron transfer from nadph. these drugs can be
classified into first-generation (e.g.  xxxd147xxx ),
second-generation (e.g.  xxxd2153xxx  and fadrazole) and
third-generation (e.g. anastrozole, letrozole and
exemestane) agents. anti-aromatase agents can be also
divided into type i and type ii inhibitors. type i
inhibitors have a steroidal structure similar to androgens
and inactivate the enzyme by blocking the substratebinding site and are therefore known as aromatase
inactivators. examples of such drugs include  xxxd2153xxx 
and exemestane. type ii inhibitors are non-steroidal and
their action is reversible. anastrozole is a thirdgeneration non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. it is the
most extensively investigated third-generation
aromatase inhibitor in the treatment of breast cancer.
for clinical use the drug is administered orally (1 mg)
once daily and the plasma steady state is reached in
41–48 h. it has no adverse influence on serum lipids and
lacks androgenic side-effects8. anastrozole contraindications include severe renal impairment (creatinine
clearance < 20 ml/min), severe hepatic impairment,
premenopausal patients (not receiving  xxxg930xxx  analogues
such as  xxxd2229xxx ) and concomitant use of estrogens. the
present article provides an overview of the evolving role
of anastrozole in the management of breast cancer.

second-line therapy
two international, phase iii, randomised trials (0027
and 0030) have been conducted to compare the efficacy
and tolerability of anastrozole with that of  xxxd2557xxx 
acetate (ma) in postmenopausal women who had
relapsed/recurred on adjuvant tamoxifen treatment or
following tamoxifen therapy for advanced breast
cancer9.  xxxd2557xxx  acetate is a progestogen which has
been used in the treatment of breast cancer.
unfortunately, the publication represents a combined
analysis of two independently-conducted trials of the
same protocol design with few details of the results of
the individual trials. one study was carried out in
europe, australia and south africa and included 378
patients; the other study involved 386 patients from the
usa and canada. all patients had evaluable disease and
70% of them had er-positive tumours. the remainder
were er-negative (5%) or of unknown er status (25%).
684 anastrozole and breast cancer

the patients were randomised into three groups:
anastrozole 1 mg once daily, anastrozole 10 mg o.d. and
 xxxd2557xxx  acetate 40 mg q.d.s. both studies were
double-blinded to anastrozole dose only but not to
 xxxd2557xxx  acetate. the end-points of the trials included
objective response rate (complete and partial response),
time to tumour progression (ttp), time to treatment
failure (ttf), duration of response, survival and
tolerability. the uicc criteria and computerised
algorithms based on tumour measurements were used to
assess response. clinical benefit analyses were
conducted after median follow-up periods of 6 and 31
months. tolerability data were assessed at median
follow-up periods of 6 and 12 months. the 6-month
analysis revealed that both doses of anastrozole were as
effective as  xxxd2557xxx  acetate in terms of overall clinical
benefit and time to disease progression. the 10-mg dose
had no additional clinical benefit over the 1-mg dose,
therefore it was decided that the 1-mg dose would be
used after tamoxifen failure. at 31 months, the data
were mature enough to allow survival analysis. the
2-year survival was 56.1% for the anastrozole group
compared with 46.3% for the ma group (hazard ratio
(hr) = 0.78, 97.5% ci = 0.6040–0.9996; p = 0.0248).
the median survival was 26.7 months and 22.5 months
for patients receiving anastrozole and ma, respectively.
the survival benefit was not statistically significant in
the north american study. there were no significant
differences between the two treatments in terms of
objective response and stable disease. the duration of
overall clinical benefit for anastrozole was 18.3 months.
tolerability data showed that anastrozole was generally
well tolerated with less weight gain ( p < 0.01) than ma
and less than 3% of patients withdrawing from the
treatment due to unacceptable side-effects. quality of
life data were not reported in these studies. anastrozole
is currently widely used as a second-line therapy in
postmenopausal women who relapse on (or fail to
respond to) tamoxifen therapy.

first-line therapy
the role of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line
therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced
breast cancer (er-positive and/or pgr-positive) was the
focus of two identically designed multi-centre trials10,11.
the first trial10 showed that anastrozole was superior to
tamoxifen in prolonging the median time to tumour
progression, ttp (11.1 vs 5.6 months; p = 0.005).
furthermore there were fewer thromboembolic events
(4.1 vs 8.2%) and vaginal bleeding episodes (1.2 vs
3.8%) in the anastrozole arm. the second trial11
demonstrated that anastrozole was equivalent to

tamoxifen in terms of clinical benefit and ttp. adverse
effects were again significantly less frequent in the
anastrozole group. the failure of the second trial to
demonstrate that anastrozole is superior to tamoxifen in
prolonging ttp can be attributed to the fact that a
greater percentage of patients in the first trial had erand/or pgr-positive tumours. a combined analysis of
both trials has shown that anastrozole was significantly
superior to tamoxifen in relation to ttp (10.7 vs 6.4
months; 2p = 0.022, figure 1). these findings strongly
suggest that anastrozole should be used as an alternative
to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with erpositive advanced breast cancer, especially in patients at
increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (dvt) and
endometrial cancer.

adjuvant therapy
the early results of the arimidex*, tamoxifen, alone
and in combination (atac) trial have been recently
reported12. this multi-centre randomised trial is the
largest trial in the field of cancer treatment. the study
aims to compare tamoxifen and anastrozole alone and in
combination in the adjuvant treatment of invasive breast
carcinoma in over 9000 postmenopausal women.
patients were not excluded if they had chemotherapy
and/or radiotherapy in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant

setting. approximately 80% of the tumours were erpositive and 60% were t2. one-third of all patients had
nodal disease. after a median of 33 months of follow-up
and a median duration of treatment of 2.5 years,
anastrozole was found to be significantly superior to
tamoxifen in terms of dfs (hr = 0.83; p = 0.0129),
adverse effects (vaginal bleeding, hot flushes,
endometrial carcinoma, thromboembolism and weight
gain) and prevention of contralateral breast cancer
(hr = 0.42; p = 0.0068). the reduction in breast
cancer recurrence was even more striking in patients
with er-positive tumours (hr = 0.78; p = 0.0054).
however, musculoskeletal disorders and bone fractures
were more frequently seen in the anastrozole group
(27.8 vs 21.2% and 5.8 vs 3.7%, respectively). dfs was
lessened when both drugs were given together than
when anastrozole was given alone. this might be due to
tamoxifen having greater estrogen agonist activity in the
low estrogen environment produced by anastrozole.
more recently, dr buzdar presented an updated analysis
with a median follow-up of 47 months at the 25th san
antonio breast cancer symposium13. the updated
analysis showed that anastrozole’s greater efficacy was
maintained over time (figure 2). in fact the absolute
benefit increased from 1.7% at 3 years to 2.9% at 4
years for patients with er-positive disease. the number
of first events for the overall population was 413
(13.2%) for the anastrozole group, and 472 (15.1%) for
the tamoxifen group. in er-positive patients, the

number of first events was 290 (11.1%) for the
anastrozole arm compared with 345 (13.3%) for the
tamoxifen arm. the new data provide reassurance that
anastrozole superiority is maintained, and predict that
anastrozole’s greater efficacy will continue. anastrozole
reduced the incidence of contralateral breast cancer by
38% ( p = 0.062) in the overall population and by 44%
( p = 0.04) in the er-positive patients compared with
tamoxifen. anastrozole also maintained its superiority
regarding tolerability and adverse effects, except for
musculoskeletal side-effects (figure 3). reassuringly,
there was no further increase in the number of fractures
in the anastrozole arm. although the absolute number of
fractures continues to increase at a rate which is greater
in the anastrozole arm than in the tamoxifen group,
there is no evidence for an increase in rate with
continuing therapy.
the recent evidence that letrozole, a third-generation
aromatase inhibitor, is more effective than tamoxifen in
patients with tumours which are positive for  xxxg682xxx -1
and/or  xxxg682xxx -2 and er14 has stimulated a retrospective
analysis of the atac study in relation to  xxxg682xxx -2 status.
this study is currently in progress. it is possible that the
early recurrences in the tamoxifen arm are associated
with  xxxg682xxx -2-positive disease and a plot of hazards would
be particularly informative.
686 anastrozole and breast cancer

a complete risk–benefit analysis requires longer
follow-up and particular points of interest will be bone
mineral density (bmd) and survival. unfortunately,
cognitive function was not a pre-defined parameter that
was monitored in the atac study. it is likely that antiosteoporosis measures such as the concomitant use of
bisphosphonates and bmd measurement (dxa scan)
will play an important role in the management of
patients suitable for adjuvant anastrozole therapy.
although longer follow up is required prior to routine
use of anastrozole in the adjuvant setting, it is currently
indicated as an adjuvant therapy in women who are
unable to tolerate tamoxifen or who are at an increased
risk of dvt or endometrial cancer.

neoadjuvant therapy
in a double-blind randomised trial, the effect of
neoadjuvant anastrozole (1 mg once daily for 12 weeks)
on tumour volume was assessed in 24 patients14. the
median reduction in tumour volume, as measured by
ultrasound, was 80.5%. of the 17 patients who would
have needed a mastectomy before treatment, 15 were
suitable for breast conservation after receiving

anastrozole. anastrozole was compared to letrozole and
tamoxifen in a neoadjuvant trial15. patients received
daily doses of either 2.5 mg or 10 mg letrozole (n = 24),
1 mg or 10 mg anastrozole (n = 24 with 17 evaluable) or
20 mg tamoxifen (n = 65). tumour volume was assessed
after 3 months by ultrasound. the reduction in tumour
volume (with 95% confidence limits) for anastrozole,
letrozole and tamoxifen was 64% (52–76), 81% (69–86)
and 48% (27–48), respectively. the authors concluded
that aromatase inhibitors were highly effective agents in
the neoadjuvant setting. as part of the ongoing clinical
trial programme for anastrozole, there are studies in
progress which are further investigating the use of
arimidex in the neoadjuvant setting. the double-blind
immediate preoperative arimidex, tamoxifen, or
combined with tamoxifen (impact) trial is comparing
neoadjuvant oral arimidex 1 mg once daily with
neoadjuvant oral tamoxifen 20 mg once daily or the two
combined16. in the impact trial, 300 postmenopausal
patients with er-positive, operable breast cancer are
being followed for 12 weeks prior to surgery. the
preoperative arimidex compared to tamoxifen
(proact) study is also looking at the neoadjuvant use
of arimidex and tamoxifen and is in the process of

recruiting patients. a total of 6440 patients will be
randomised 1:1 to two treatment arms. in this trial
chemotherapy may be given, where required, during
both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant periods. assessment
and surgery will be performed at 3 months, and patients
will continue treatment for 5 years. the primary endpoints are response rate, breast conservation rate and
safety.

pre-/peri-menopausal
patients17
so far, there is limited data on the potential role of
anastrozole in pre- or peri-menopausal women who are
rendered postmenopausal at the time of anastrozole
administration by endocrine or chemotherapeutic
interventions. the austrian breast cancer study group
presented bmd data in 278 premenopausal women
with er- and/or pgr-positive breast cancer being
treated with  xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen +/-  xxxd3561xxx 
(4 mg or 6 mg) or with  xxxd2229xxx  plus anastrozole +/ xxxd3561xxx  (4 mg or 6 mg). the investigators observed a

decline in bmd as determined by dxa imaging (lumbar
spine and greater trochanter) in patients receiving
tamoxifen or anastrozole without  xxxd3561xxx . bmd
reduction was significantly greater for anastrozole
( p = 0.0125). however, after 6 months of treatment
with  xxxd3561xxx , the cohorts receiving  xxxd3561xxx  had
significantly higher bmd ( p < 0.0001). although longer
follow-up is required to ensure that  xxxd3561xxx  benefits
are maintained, it would be reasonable to consider
 xxxd3561xxx  therapy (4 mg) in postmenopausal women
receiving adjuvant anastrozole, who are at high risk of
osteoporosis.
in a study involving 119 pre- or perimenopausal
women with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer
randomised to  xxxd2229xxx  plus tamoxifen or  xxxd2229xxx  plus
anastrozole, the or was significantly higher for the
anastrozole plus  xxxd2229xxx  arm compared with the
tamoxifen plus  xxxd2229xxx  arm (80 vs 53%; p = 0.0023).
furthermore, the time to death was also significantly
longer for the anastrozole plus  xxxd2229xxx  group (18.9 vs
14.3 months; p = 0.0001), suggesting that this
combination should be considered for the treatment of
pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone-sensitive
advanced breast cancer.
