abstract
we cloned the human tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (htph2) gene by rt-pcr, and expressed and purified its product as a maltose-binding
protein (mbp)-fusion protein. we investigated the effects of essential divalent cations and l-phenylalanine ( xxxd2433xxx ) on the htph2 activity for
the first time, and compared them with those on human  xxxg2276xxx  (hth1) activity. we found that cobaltous and manganous ions
inhibited the activities of both enzymes but that hth1 was affected at lower concentrations than htph2. from kinetic analyses, we found that
phenylalanine acted as an inhibitor more strongly against htph2 than against hth1. these data are important for elucidating the molecular
mechanism underlying the alterations in the contents of serotonin and catecholamines in the brain under pathological and physiological conditions,
such as hyperphenylalaninemia and chronic manganese toxicity.

aromatic amino acid hydroxylases such as  xxxg2276xxx 
( xxxg2276xxx , th;  xxxg2276xxx ) [17],  xxxg1660xxx  ( xxxg1660xxx , pah;
 xxxg1660xxx ) [8], and tryptophan hydroxylase (tryptophan 5monooxygenase, tph;  xxxg2315xxx ) [3], are widely expressed
in higher organisms. these enzymes require an aromatic amino
acid and molecular oxygen as substrates, as well as  xxxd2385xxx 
and (6r)-l- xxxd2033xxx - xxxd3166xxx  (bh4) as cofactors [2,9,11,17]. tph catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting
step of the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5ht). this enzyme hydroxylates l-tryptophan ( xxxd3454xxx ) to form
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp), and the product 5-htp is then
decarboxylated to serotonin by  xxxg618xxx  ( xxxg618xxx ,  xxxg618xxx ).  xxxg618xxx  also catalyzes the decarboxylation of  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa), produced
from l-tyrosine ( xxxd3459xxx ) by the action of th, to dopamine.
until recently, it had been thought that tph was translated
from mrna transcribed from a single gene and that the differences in the properties of neuronal and peripheral enzymes
were due to post-translational modification [10]. from their
study on tph−/− mice, walther and bader [21] discovered that

the amount of serotonin in the mutant brain was unchanged,
although the amounts of serotonin in the peripheral tissues were
almost depleted in the knockout mice. they discovered that brain
serotonin in these animals was formed by a previously unknown
brain-specific isoform of tph, which they referred to as  xxxg2256xxx 
[21,22]. these investigators demonstrated that the conventional
tph gene (now called  xxxg2315xxx ) was expressed in the pineal gland
and gut but that the  xxxg2256xxx  gene was expressed only in 5-htproducing neurons in the brain.
the enzymatic properties of  xxxg2256xxx  have been poorly understood. very recently, mckinney et al. [14] reported the characterization of human tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (htph2) and
compared its properties with those of  xxxg2315xxx . in this present
study, we cloned human  xxxg2256xxx  cdna and expressed its enzyme
product in escherichia coli (e. coli) as a fusion protein with
maltose-binding protein (mbp), since it was earlier reported
that  xxxg2315xxx  was difficult to purify [1] and that the mbp-fusion
protein was the most effective to express and purify  xxxg2315xxx  [15].
in order to investigate the differences in the characteristics of
 xxxg2256xxx  with those of the other aromatic amino acid hydroxylase
in the brain, we also expressed and purified human th type 1
(hth1) as an mbp-fused form. as calcium, magnesium, cobalt,
manganese, and iron ions are essential divalent cations in higher
organisms, we examined their effects on htph2 and hth1 activities, especially since metal ions may interfere with the reaction

of the  xxxd2385xxx , an essential cofactor for catalysis by these
enzymes.
expression vector pmal-c2e and amylose resin were from
new england biolabs inc. (beverly, ma, usa). human fetal
brain rna was purchased from clontech (palo alto, ca, usa).
all reagents were of analytical grade and used without further
purification.
human  xxxg2256xxx  cdna was cloned by reverse transcription
and pcr amplification. briefly, human fetal brain mrna was
reverse-transcribed to cdna with superscripttm ii rnase h−
reverse transcriptase and random hexamers as primers. fulllength htph2 was amplified by pcr using forward primer
5 -ggtaccgatgcagccagcaatgatgatg-3 and reverse
primer 5 -tctagatccccagatattggttcattttg-3 . the
underlined nucleotides of the forward primer represent the kpni
site at the upstream region of the initiation codon, and those
of the reverse primer, the xbai site; and the small letters represent the bases mutated from the original sequence (genbank:
ay098914). the termination codon of htph2 is taa; but in
order to generate the xbai site at the termination codon, the
codon was changed to tag. these restriction enzyme sites
were introduced in order to facilitate subsequent cloning into
the expression vector used. after the sequence had been verified, the full-length htph2 gene was digested with restriction
enzymes kpni and xbai, and the resulting kpni–xbai fragment
was inserted into the pmal-c2e vector, thus generating pmalc2e-htph2. pmal-c2e is an e. coli expression vector used in
protein fusion and purification systems, and was designed to
create fusion between a desired cloned gene and the e. coli mal
e gene. pmal-c2e-htph2 was used to transform e. coli strain
bl21(de3).
expression and purification of mbp-tagged htph2 by amylose resin affinity chromatography were performed according to
the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modification, i.e., ferrous
ammonium sulfate at the concentration of 0.2 mm was added
to the culture medium of the transformed e. coli. after having been harvested, the cells were sonicated in cell lysis buffer,
which was composed of 20 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.4) containing
10% glycerol, 200 mm nacl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), and
1 mm edta. the cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for
30 min, and the supernatant was collected and fractionated by
using ammonium sulfate from 41% to 60%; and these fractions
were applied to an amylose resin column. human  xxxg2256xxx  fraction was eluted with the same lysis buffer containing 10 mm
maltose, the eluate was applied to a column of superose 6
hr 10/30, and active fractions were collected. the purity of
htph2 was checked by sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) with coomassie brilliant blue r-250 (cbb)
staining at each step, and protein concentration was determined
by the method of bradford with ␥-globulin used as a standard.
human th1 gene fused with a pmal vector was kindly
donated by nakashima [18], and was used to transform e. coli
bl21(de3). expression and purification of mbp-tagged hth1
was the same as for htph2 except that hth1 fractions were
collected from 31% to 50% ammonium sulfate.
the enzyme activity of htph2 was measured by hplcfluorescence detection [5] with slight modifications. the stan-

dard reaction mixture (total volume 100 ␮l) contained 120 mm
na-hepes (ph 7.2), 2.5 mm dtt, 0.1 mg/ml catalase, 20 ␮m
ferrous ammonium sulfate, 100 ␮m l-tryptophan (otherwise
indicated), and the enzyme. the reaction was started by the
addition of bh4 solution to achieve a final concentration of
500 ␮m. the reaction mixture was incubated in air at 30 ◦ c for
10 min, filtered, and injected into the hplc-fluorescence detection apparatus, which was equipped with a reverse-phase column
capcell pak c18 ug80 s-5 (4.6 mm i.d. × 250 mm, shiseido, tokyo, japan); and fluorescence was detected at 350 nm
with excitation at 302 nm. the mobile phase for the hplc was
a solution composed of 15 mm acetate–citric buffer (ph 3.5),
5% acetonitrile, and 7.5% methanol. for assessing the effects of
divalent cations, we varied the concentrations of them from 0 to
1.0 mm. the divalent cations selected were cobalt, manganese,
calcium, and magnesium. in the case of calcium ions, egta was
added to the reaction mixture at the final concentration of 1.0 ␮m
to remove any trace amount of contaminating calcium ions in
the distilled water. for the kinetic assay of htph2, the concentration of  xxxd3454xxx  was varied from 0 to 800 ␮m, l-phenylalanine
was added at the final concentration of 50, 100, and 200 ␮m to
each set of reaction mixtures, and the mixtures were incubated
for 5 min.
enzyme activity of hth1 was measured by an hplcelectrochemical detection (ecd) method [19]. the standard
reaction mixture (total volume 200 ␮l) contained 200 mm nahepes (ph 7.0), 100 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 200 ␮m l-tyrosine (otherwise indicated), and the enzyme.
the reaction was started by the addition of bh4 at the final
concentration of 1.0 mm. the reaction mixture was incubated
in air at 37 ◦ c for 10 min, and the l-dopa produced was
separated with a reverse-phase column of nucleosil 1007c-18 (4.0 mm i.d. × 250 mm, gl science, tokyo, japan), and
detected electrochemically with an applied voltage of 600 mv.
the mobile phase for the hplc was 0.1 m sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 3.5) containing 8 ␮m edta and 1% methanol. in the
experiments on the effects of the divalent cations, the conditions
were the same as those used for the tph assay. in the kinetic
assay for hth1, the concentration of  xxxd3459xxx  was varied from 0 to
400 ␮m, l-phenylalanine was added at the final concentrations
of 50, 100, and 200 ␮m to each set of reaction mixtures, and the
mixtures were incubated for 5 min.
first, we cloned human  xxxg2256xxx  cdna from human fetal brain
mrna by rt-pcr. by sequencing the cloned cdna, we found
a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) at the base position of
a936g (snp id: rs7305115), though it did not change the amino
acid specified, i.e., proline312 . the digested dna fragment was
cloned into pmal-c2e vector; and mbp-tagged htph2 was
expressed in e. coli, purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, amylose resin affinity chromatography, and gel filtration
chromatography. mbp-tagged hth1 was also expressed and
purified in the same way. these two mbp-tagged enzymes
were subjected to sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on
10% polyacrylamide gels, and the homogeneity of the enzymes
was confirmed (fig. 1). molecular weights of mbp-tagged
htph2 and hth1 determined from the sds–page were 97
and 113 kda, respectively.

fig. 1. sds–page of purified mbp-tagged htph2 and hth1. one microgram
of htph2 (lane 2) or hth1 (lane 3) was applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel.
following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with cbb.

mbp-htph2 is a protein of 880 amino acids (aa), consisting of an n-terminal mbp region (390-aa) and a c-terminal
htph2 region (490-aa), and has a calculated molecular weight
of 98.8 kda. mbp-hth1 is an 892-aa protein having an nterminal mbp region (396-aa) and a c-terminal hth1 region
(496 aa, the first methionine was deleted), and a calculated
molecular weight of 98.9 kda. the molecular weight of htph2
estimated from sds–page was thus in good agreement with the
calculated value, whereas that of hth1 from sds–page was
higher than the calculated value. the reason for the different
mobility may be explained by the difference in the amino acid
composition.
next, we examined the effects of divalent cations on the activities of both enzymes. magnesium and calcium ions did not
affect the activity of htph2 at concentrations below 1 mm (data
not shown). cobaltous ions strongly inhibited both enzymes. as
shown in fig. 2a, only 20% of the activity of either hydroxylase
remained in the presence of 100 ␮m cobaltous ions. manganous
ions moderately inhibited the hth1 activity, reducing it to nearly
50% at concentrations of 10 ␮m or higher (fig. 2b). we found

fig. 2. effect of divalent cations on the activity of htph2 and hth1. the reaction mixture for the  xxxg2256xxx  assay contained 120 mm na-hepes (ph 7.2), 2.5 mm
dtt, 0.1 mg/ml catalase, 20 ␮m ferrous ammonium sulfate, 100 ␮m  xxxd3454xxx ,
500 ␮m bh4, and enzyme. the reaction mixture for the th1 assay contained
200 mm na-hepes (ph 7.0), 100 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.2 mg/ml catalase,
200 ␮m l-tyrosine, 1 mm bh4, and enzyme. data are mean values from two
independent experiments each done in duplicate, and are represented as percentages relative to the enzyme activity without cations defined as 100%. the mean
activity of htph2 without test cations was 262 nmol/(min mg) protein; and that
of hth1, 146 nmol/(min mg) protein. closed circles indicate htph2 activity;
and open ones indicate hth1 activity. (a) cobaltous ion, (b) manganous ion.

that hth1 showed sensitivity to manganese that was 2 orders of
magnitude higher than that of htph2 (fig. 2b).
this is the first report on the effects of metal ions on the activity of purified  xxxg2256xxx  fusion protein, although the effects of metals
on th [4] and pah [23] were investigated in earlier studies. we
found that the metal ions differently affected the activities of

264

s. ogawa, h. ichinose / neuroscience letters 401 (2006) 261–265

htph2 and hth1, and especially that hth1 had higher sensitivity to manganese, as well as to cobalt, than htph2. it has
been noted that chronic manganese toxicity causes symptoms
like those of parkinsonism. mustafa and chandra [16] reported
that the administration of manganese to rabbits decreased the
amount of catecholamines but did not change the amount of
serotonin in the brain. our present results may explain the reason for this selective reduction in catecholamines by manganese
without altering the amount of serotonin, because the th activity was more highly susceptible to the manganous ion than was
the  xxxg2256xxx  activity (fig. 2b).
both th and tph can catalyze phenylalanine to form tyrosine as well as their natural substrates [7,14]. since mckinney
et al. [14] showed that the substrate recognition of  xxxg2256xxx  was
more stringent than that of  xxxg2315xxx , phenylalanine may act as an
inhibitor of  xxxg2256xxx . so we examined the inhibitory effects of

human  xxxg2256xxx  was incubated with 20 ␮m ferrous ammonium sulfate, 0–800 ␮m

 xxxd2433xxx  on the activities of htph2 and hth1. double reciprocal
plots of  xxxd2433xxx  inhibition for both enzymes are depicted in fig. 3a
and b. kinetic parameters, such as binding constants for substrates (km ), substrate inhibition constants (kis ), and maximum
velocities (vmax ) were determined from the lineweaver–burk
equation including the substrate inhibition term [20]. other constants against phenylalanine, such as competitive inhibition constants (ki ) and noncompetitive inhibition constants (ki ), were
determined for both enzymes; and all constants are summarized
in table 1.
ichiyama et al. [6] reported that  xxxd2433xxx  showed complete
competitive inhibition against bovine pineal tph ( xxxg2315xxx ). on
the other hand,  xxxd2433xxx  showed competitive and noncompetitive mixed-type inhibition against htph2 in our experiment
(fig. 3a). human th1 was inhibited by  xxxd2433xxx  in the similar
manner as htph2, but the inhibition was rather more competitive and less noncompetitive (fig. 3b), a result agreeing with that
for bovine th [7]. this mixed type of inhibition of  xxxd2433xxx  against
htph2 could be an intrinsic property of htph2. when the inhibition constants were compared for both enzymes, competitive
and noncompetitive inhibition constants of htph2 against  xxxd2433xxx 
were smaller than those of hth1. these data suggest that  xxxg2256xxx 
should lose its activity at lower concentrations of  xxxd2433xxx  than
th1, since smaller inhibition constants indicate higher affinity
for  xxxd2433xxx .
the depletion of cerebral serotonin in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia is suggested to be caused by competitive
inhibition of  xxxd3454xxx  transport into the brain [13,24] or of  xxxd3454xxx 
hydroxylation by the excess  xxxd2433xxx  [12,24]. from our results,
although these enzymes were fused with mbp, our data suggest
that the biosynthesis of serotonin in the central nervous system
is more affected than that of catecholamines by a high concentration of  xxxd2433xxx .
