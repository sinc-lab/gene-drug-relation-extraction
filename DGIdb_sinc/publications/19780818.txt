 xxxg1664xxx  ( xxxg1664xxx ), a member of the second gap junction protein family
identiﬁed in vertebrates, appears to preferentially form non-junctional
membrane channels. a candidate regulatory protein of  xxxg1664xxx  is the  xxxg1232xxx  subunit kvb3, previously identiﬁed by bacterial two-hybrid
strategies. here, we report on the physical association of  xxxg1664xxx  with kvb3
by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line
(neuro2a). furthermore, in vivo co-expression of  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 was
shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. kvb3 is known to
accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating potassium channels
under reducing conditions. we subsequently found that  xxxg1664xxx  channel currents exhibit a signiﬁcant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and
that this effect is attenuated in the presence of kvb3. apparently, kvb3 is
involved in regulating the susceptibility of  xxxg1664xxx  channels to redox potential. furthermore, the  xxxg1664xxx  channel blockers  xxxd433xxx  and probenecid were less effective in inhibiting  xxxg1664xxx  currents when kvb3 was
co-expressed. the inﬂuence of kvb3 on  xxxg1664xxx  is the ﬁrst example of modulation of  xxxg1664xxx  channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests
the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials.

introduction
the pannexin protein family was discovered by panchin et al. by sequence homology with the invertebrate
 xxxg1664xxx  gap junction family [1]. in contrast to innexins,
pannexins are found in vertebrates. localization studies demonstrated widespread expression of pannexins
in developing and adult tissue of higher vertebrates,
with mrna and protein detectable throughout the
mammalian brain [2–8].

the homology of pannexins to innexins suggested
that both protein families function as gap junctionforming proteins. initial experimental evidence for this
hypothesis was obtained using the heterologous xenopus oocyte expression system, in which  xxxg1664xxx  proved
capable of forming homomeric membrane channels
and gap junction channels and heteromeric channels
with panx2 [9]. new evidence has accrued suggesting

that  xxxg1664xxx  preferably forms non-junctional channels
in vivo [2,3,10–13]. in contrast to connexins,  xxxg1664xxx  is
glycosylated on the second extracellular loop. this
sugar residue was shown to prevent pairing of two
pannexins, which is necessary for the formation of a
functional gap junction channel [10,12,14].
multiple functions have been attributed to  xxxg1664xxx 
channels. it was shown that  xxxg1664xxx  forms mechanosensitive channels that are permeable to atp [15] and are
sensitive to changes in intracellular ca2+ levels [16],
making them ideal candidates for the initiation and
propagation of ca2+ waves [16]. furthermore, expression of  xxxg1664xxx  in erythrocytes, which are gap junctiondeﬁcient, was shown to be responsible for atp release
when the cells were exposed to osmotic stress [3]. similarly,  xxxg1664xxx  has been shown to be expressed exclusively at the luminal membrane of bronchial epithelial
cells, the site of atp release [17], whereas connexins
are found exclusively at the basolateral, i.e. junctional,
membrane of these cells [18]. in addition,  xxxg1664xxx , in
combination with the purinergic p2x7 receptor, is part
of a permeabilization pore or death channel receptor
capable of modulating release of the pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine interleukin-1b [19,20]. mechanistic clues for
understanding the apparent multifunctional potencies
of  xxxg1664xxx  channels are still lacking.
the biophysical properties of  xxxg1664xxx  channels were
initially characterized in the heterologous xenopus
laevis oocyte expression system. single oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  exogenously show large outward currents
if they are depolarized to membrane potentials above
)20 mv [9]. single-channel recordings revealed that
 xxxg1664xxx  channels display several sub-conductance states
and a high unitary conductance of approximately
500 ps [15]. furthermore, pharmacological studies
showed that  xxxg1664xxx  currents can be blocked by  xxxd433xxx  (cbx) and b- xxxd2221xxx , both wellestablished gap junction blockers [21]. in addition,
blockade of  xxxg1664xxx  channels by a  xxxg1664xxx  mimetic peptide [20], three connexin mimetic peptides and a
poly(ethylene glycol) compound (peg 1500) [22] has
been demonstrated. apparently, these substances do
not act via sequence-speciﬁc interactions, but may simply block the channel sterically. recently,  xxxg1664xxx  channels were found to be inhibited by the gout remedy
probenecid, which did not block connexin 46 hemichannels and a chimera of the connexins cx32 and
 xxxg895xxx . it was proposed that probenecid is a blocker
that can distinguish between channels formed by
 xxxg1664xxx  and connexin hemichannels [23].
we reported previously that kvb3 is a potential
interaction partner of the c-terminus of  xxxg1664xxx  using
an escherichia coli two-hybrid system [24]. image

modulation of  xxxg1664xxx  drug sensitivity

analysis of ﬂuorescence-tagged  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 provided preliminary and indirect data on co-localization of both proteins in transfected neuro2a (n2a)
cells. kvb3 belongs to the family of b-subunits of
the voltage-dependent potassium channels [25]. kvb3
and its close relative kvb1 are known to convey
rapid inactivation to otherwise slowly inactivating
potassium channels [25,26]. as inactivation by kvb3
is dependent on the intracellular redox potential, we
assumed that a similar mechanism could alter the
gating behavior of  xxxg1664xxx  channels. therefore, reducing agents were applied during voltage clamp recordings on oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  alone or in
combination with kvb3. our results demonstrate
that reducing agents attenuated currents evoked by
depolarizing voltage steps in oocytes expressing
 xxxg1664xxx  only, but not in cells co-expressing  xxxg1664xxx  and
kvb3. furthermore, in oocytes co-expressing  xxxg1664xxx 
with the kvb3 subunit, the inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx  currents by cbx and probenecid was also attenuated
compared to oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  only. thus,
kvb3 rescues inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx  currents through
pharmacological agents.

in the present study, physical in vivo interaction of
 xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 was assessed by performing co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunohistochemistry. for
co-immunoprecipitation assays, n2a cells were double-transfected with constructs encoding myc–kvb3
and  xxxg1664xxx –ha proteins, and lysates were precipitated
using myc and ha antibodies. myc–kvb3 was co-precipitated from these lysates when the pulldown was
performed using ha antibodies as shown in fig. 1a
(lane 1) by the expected immunoreactive band of
approximately 45 kda (the complete western blots are
shown in fig. s1). the control blot (right panel)
showed the expected immunoreactivity for myc–kvb3.
conversely,  xxxg1664xxx –ha was co-precipitated from these
lysates when a myc antibody was used, as shown in
fig. 1b (lane 1). the control blot (right panel) shows
the expected immunoreactivity for  xxxg1664xxx –ha at
approximately 49 kda.
in both pulldowns, detection of speciﬁc interaction
was only present when cells were double-transfected.
no signal was detected when the pulldown antibody
was omitted (fig. 1a,b, lanes 3 and 4), indicating
that  xxxg1664xxx  can interact with kvb3. furthermore,
control pulldowns were performed using single-transfected cells expressing either only  xxxg1664xxx –ha or only

a prerequisite for functional interaction between
 xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 in vivo is that expression of both
proteins occurs within the same cell. localization
studies were performed, extending earlier ﬁndings on
 xxxg1664xxx  localization in the central nervous system
[4,5,7,13,27]. as no speciﬁc antibody for kvb3 was
available, an antibody was generated in chicken, and
subjected to rigorous controls for speciﬁcity. the
overall sequence homology between the kvb subunits
is high, with unique sequence motifs found only in
the n-terminal domains of individual subunits [25].
to ensure that our antibody is speciﬁc for kvb3
and to rule out cross-reactivity with other subunits,
a unique peptide sequence from the n-terminal
region corresponding to amino acids 22–40 of kvb3
was selected as the antigen. the speciﬁcity of the
novel kvb3 antibody was ﬁrst tested by western blot
analysis using lysates of transfected n2a cells.
lysates derived from cells transfected with pcs2+
-kvb3 and pcr3.1-uni-myc-kvb3 yielded the
expected signals of 43.7 and 45 kda (fig. 2a, left
panel). no signal was evident in the case of untransfected cells or lysates from cells transfected with the
close relative kvb1.1 and myc–kvb1.1.
the speciﬁcity was further documented by absorption of the antibody with the cognate peptide for 1 h
prior to its use for immunodetection on western blots.
as shown in fig. 2a (right panel), the kvb3-speciﬁc
signals derived from lysates of pcs2+-kvb3- and
pcr3.1-uni-myc-kvb3-transfected cells were nearly
completely abolished.
the antibody was further tested by double immunocytochemistry on pcr3.1-uni-myc-kvb3-transfected n2a cells. for immunolabeling the kvb3- and a
myc-antibody were used. signals derived from
double-labeled expression sites overlapped almost
completely, as shown in fig. 2b–d. staining of pecfp-n1-kvb1.1-transfected n2a cells with the kvb3
antibody did not show signals (fig. s4). obviously, the antibody does not cross-react with the
close paralogue kvb1.1 nor other endogenous
proteins of n2a cells in immunocytochemistry.
taken together, the results from western blotting
and immunocytochemistry suggest that the novel
antibody is speciﬁc for kvb3, and cross-reactivity
with other b-subunits or other proteins is unlikely to
occur.
expression of  xxxg1664xxx  has been well described
throughout the brain, especially in the hippocampus
and cerebellum [4,5,7,13]. the newly generated kvb3

antibody and a  xxxg1664xxx  antibody [12] were used to label
consecutive sections from adult rat brain. figure 3a
shows a typical view of a rat hippocampus stained
with the kvb3 antibody. staining of a consecutive section using the  xxxg1664xxx  antibody is shown in fig. 3b.
both proteins were co-expressed throughout the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, especially the ca1
region (for orientation, see fig. 3d). furthermore,
granule cells of the dentate gyrus co-express  xxxg1664xxx 
and kvb3. reduced staining was evident when the
kvb3 antibody was pre-incubated with the cognate
peptide, as shown in fig. 3c.
in addition to the hippocampus, expression of  xxxg1664xxx 
has also been described in the cerebellum [4,5,7].
therefore, co-expression of  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 was also
tested in this brain area. kvb3 was strongly expressed
in purkinje cells of the cerebellum (fig. 3e). cell
bodies, as well as the dendritic trees, were robustly
labeled by the antibody. consecutive sections stained
with the  xxxg1664xxx  antibody displayed strong labeling in
the soma and moderate labeling in the dendritic processes of purkinje cells (fig. 3f). again, labeling with
kvb3 antibody pre-incubated with the immunogenic
peptide led to a signiﬁcant decrease in staining, providing further proof of the speciﬁcity of the antibody
(fig. 3g). cresyl violet staining was performed for
orientation (fig. 3h).
in summary, these results provide strong evidence
for co-expression of  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 in principal
neurons of brain tissues. this ﬁnding is essential for a
functional role of the interaction of both proteins as
evidenced by our in vitro studies (see below).
kvb3 alters the electrophysiological properties
of  xxxg1664xxx

cells (nt) were used to test the specificity of the kvb3 antibody on
western blots. when the antibody was used for immunodetection
without any further treatment, signals with the expected size for
kvb3 (43.7 kda) and myc–kvb3 (45 kda) were seen, but no signal
was obtained for kvb1.1 (44.7 kda) or myc–kvb1.1 (46 kda) (left
panel). incubation of the antibody with the cognate peptide prior to
immunodetection resulted in a significant reduction of the specific
signals (right panel). (b–d) n2a cells were transfected with
pcr3.1-uni-myc-kvb3 and subjected to immunocytochemistry
2 days after transfection. a monoclonal myc antibody (b) and the
kvb3 antibody (c) were used for immunodetection. the overlay of
the two signals (d) shows that they overlap to a great extent. scale
bar = 10 lm. (e) the specificity of the  xxxg1664xxx  antibody was further
documented by western blot analysis using lysates of transfected
n2a cells. the antibody reveals the typical pattern for  xxxg1664xxx , representing the various glycosylated variants as well as the unglycosylated form. no signal is seen in untransfected cells (nt).

kvb3 promotes rapid inactivation of otherwise slowly
inactivating potassium channels that are dependent on
an intracellular reducing environment [25,28,29]. we
assumed that kvb3 could inﬂuence the electrophysiological properties of  xxxg1664xxx  in a similar way depending
on the intracellular redox potential, and tested this
hypothesis using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique on injected xenopus laevis oocytes that expressed
either  xxxg1664xxx  or co-expressed  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3. oocytes
were held at )30 mv, and depolarizing pulses to
+60 mv were applied to transiently open  xxxg1664xxx  channels. current amplitudes were measured for 10–15 min
before various concentrations of the reducing agent
tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (tcep) were bathapplied to the oocytes. application of tcep to
oocytes expressing  xxxg1664xxx  only reproducibly decreased
current amplitudes in a concentration-dependent

modulation of  xxxg1664xxx  drug sensitivity

s. bunse et al.

intracellular redox conditions modulate the
 xxxg1664xxx  conductance
to study whether the effect of kvb3 on the inactivation pattern of  xxxg1664xxx  induced by changes in redox
potentials is speciﬁc or a more general phenomenon,
we tested the effect of cbx on cells expressing  xxxg1664xxx 
only or in combination with kvb3. high sensitivity of
the  xxxg1664xxx  channel to cbx has been shown previously
[21]. consistent with the previous study, we were able
to elicit strong inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx -mediated currents
in  xxxg1664xxx -expressing oocytes. an example of a typical
current trace is shown in fig. 5a, demonstrating cbxmediated inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx  channel activity. in contrast, inhibition by cbx was signiﬁcantly diminished
when cells expressed both proteins (fig. 5b,c). the
same effect was achieved when probenecid was
applied. this drug, in addition to its well known effect
a

on organic anion transporters, also inhibits panx1mediated currents. as shown in fig. 5, co-expression
of kvb3 results in a signiﬁcantly lower inhibition of
 xxxg1664xxx -mediated currents by probenecid compared to
the reduction of current amplitudes in the absence of
kvb3. figure 6 shows that the attenuating effect of
kvb3 co-expression on inhibition of  xxxg1664xxx  currents by
cbx occurs over a wide range of concentrations.

discussion
in this study, we provide in vivo evidence for an association of  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3, a member of the b-subunit
family of the shaker-related potassium channels, using
co-immunoprecipitation from a mammalian heterologous expression system. furthermore, we demonstrate

oocyte expression system, we established that  xxxg1664xxx 
channels are sensitive to reducing agents such as tcep
and dithiothreitol, and that functional interaction of
kvb3 with  xxxg1664xxx  modulates the behavior of  xxxg1664xxx 
channels toward reducing agents. the inhibitory action
of cbx and probenecid on  xxxg1664xxx  currents was also
attenuated.
for a mechanistic explanation of these effects, molecular details of the regulatory subunits of voltage-dependent potassium channels and their interaction with the
channel sites must be considered. the b-subunits of
the voltage-dependent potassium channels show high
sequence homology, especially in the long conserved
core domain used for direct interaction with the n-terminus of the potassium channels. the splice variants of
kvb1 and kvb3 have a different n-terminal inactivation domain, which is absent in kvb2. this n-terminus
of the subunits is responsible for rapid inactivation to
otherwise slowly inactivating kv1 channels, thereby
regulating electrical cell activity. this inactivation
mechanism resembles the ball-and-chain mechanism
that is typical of fast-inactivating channels [30].
in our e. coli two-hybrid screening, we found that
the last 58 amino acids of kvb3 interacted with the
c-terminus of  xxxg1664xxx  [24]. it is interesting that the
c-terminus of kvb3 was found to interact with  xxxg1664xxx ,
leaving the n-terminus free to inﬂuence the gating
mechanism of  xxxg1664xxx , as is the case for the potassium
channels. within the last 58 amino acids, kvb3 shows
66% sequence homology to kvb1.1 and 71% to kvb2,
and thus  xxxg1664xxx  may also be capable of interacting
with these proteins as well. due to their different spatial and temporal expression patterns, interaction with
subunits other than kvb3 could enlarge the repertoire
of regulatory functions for  xxxg1664xxx .
the expression of  xxxg1664xxx  in the murine brain has
been well documented, and its localization in neurons
throughout the brain has been reported previously
[4,5,7,13]. although kvb3 has been reported to be
expressed in brain tissue [25], a detailed protein expression analysis was lacking. here we demonstrate
co-expression of  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3 in principal neurons
of the hippocampus and in purkinje cells of the cerebellum. the physiological meaning of this interaction
is essentially unknown, but some clues may be derived
from our functional analysis in the oocyte expression
system.
for kvb1.1, it was shown that inactivation of the
channel is sensitive to regulation by intracellular redox
potentials. a cysteine in the n-terminus of kvb1
appears to play a critical role in this process [31]. this
cysteine is conserved and is also present in the
n-terminus of kvb3. initial studies of the inactivating
6266

inﬂuence of kvb3 were performed on an n-terminally
truncated mutant of  xxxg1233xxx , from which the essential
domain for fast inactivation of  xxxg1233xxx  had been deleted
(amino acids 1-110). co-expression of kvb3 and
kv1.4d1-110 restored fast inactivation of the  xxxg1232xxx , but only under reducing cytosolic conditions [32].
these initial data prompted us to study whether
kvb3 exhibits potential regulatory activity on the electrophysiological properties of  xxxg1664xxx  channels in
response to changes of reducing conditions. interestingly, the reducing agent tcep had a profound effect
on channel activity of oocytes expressing only  xxxg1664xxx .
a decrease in current amplitude was observed directly
after application of the agent. in oocytes co-expressing
 xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3, this reduction was compromised,
indicating that the interaction between kvb3 and
 xxxg1664xxx  inﬂuences the regulation of  xxxg1664xxx  channels by
linking this interaction to redox signaling. in line with
this interpretation is the observation that no obvious
effect of kvb3 on  xxxg1664xxx  channel properties as related
to voltage-activated channel activity was found in the
absence of reducing agents (data not shown).
the sensitivity of  xxxg1664xxx  channels to reducing agents
is of special interest when pathological situations are
considered. redox signaling plays an important role in
cells under pathological conditions such as hypoxia
and ischemia. opening of large channels under ischemic conditions is crucial for cell death, as it leads to a
collapse of ion gradients, increase of free intracellular
protons, inﬂux of ca2+ , and loss of metabolites [33].
it could be speculated that kvb3 regulates the susceptibility of  xxxg1664xxx  channels to changes in redox potentials. a possible involvement of  xxxg1664xxx  in cell death
during ischemia is supported by recent ﬁndings [34],
which described opening of a large channel in isolated
hippocampal neurons following oxygen and glucose
deprivation. because of the high single-channel
conductance of the oxygen and glucose deprivationactivated channel and its sensitivity to cbx blockade,
the authors concluded that the observed channels are
likely to be  xxxg1664xxx  channels. in line with the results of
these studies are observations of increased calcein leakage from primary cultured hippocampal neurons under
oxygen and glucose deprivation conditions. this
activity was dependent on  xxxd2738xxx  and could be
attenuated by application of the reducing agent dithiothreitol.  xxxg1664xxx  was proposed to be responsible for
the observed increase in channel activity, but direct
evidence for this assumption was not provided [35].
the role of the interaction between  xxxg1664xxx  and kvb3
for  xxxg1664xxx  channel activity under ischemic conditions
requires further experimental evaluation.

s. bunse et al.

a similar impact of reducing conditions has been
attributed to  xxxg895xxx  ( xxxg895xxx ) hemichannels. opening of  xxxg895xxx  hemichannels was shown to occur under
metabolic inhibition induced by blocking the oxidative
and glycolytic metabolism in cortical astrocytes [36].
dye uptake, supposedly through  xxxg895xxx  hemichannels,
induced by metabolic inhibition was reduced by application of reducing agents. however, application of
reducing agents to transfected cells expressing  xxxg895xxx 
under normoxic conditions led to an increase in dye
uptake [37]. these data imply that  xxxg895xxx  hemichannels
are sensitive to changes in the intracellular redox
potential. in contrast to  xxxg1664xxx ,  xxxg895xxx  is mainly
expressed in astrocytes and not in neurons, while
 xxxg1664xxx  is substantially expressed in neurons throughout
the whole brain [5,7]. thus these two forms of
(hemi)channel activities may play different roles due to
their differential expression patterns.
remarkably, the rescue effect of kvb3 is not
restricted to changes in redox activities, but encloses
common inhibitors of  xxxg1664xxx  channels as well.  xxxg1664xxx 
has been shown to be highly sensitive to cbx [9] and
the anti-gout drug probenecid [23]. the rescue effect of
kvb3 on  xxxg1664xxx  activity in the presence of these drugs
indicates that we are dealing with a general mechanism
that appears to be essential for the regulation of this
channel.
an important corollary of the present ﬁndings is
that the results of studies involving drugs such as cbx
or probenecid to assess the contribution of  xxxg1664xxx  to
certain physiological or pathological functions have to
be interpreted with caution. a negative result does not
exclude  xxxg1664xxx  from such functions because the drug
effects might be attenuated in the particular study by
co-expression of kvb3 with  xxxg1664xxx .

experimental procedures
cell culture, transfection and plasmids
n2a cells were cultured as described previously [38]. for
transfection, 1.5 · 106 cells were seeded on 10 cm dishes.
transient transfection was performed the next day using 2 lg
dna expression plasmid and the effectene transfection protocol as recommended by the manufacturer (qiagen, hilden,
germany). the coding region of rpanx2 in prk5-rpanx2-ha
(a kind gift from dr roberto bruzzone, hong kong university ⁄ pasteur research centre, hong kong) was replaced by
the full-length mouse  xxxg1664xxx  cdna [gene identiﬁcation number (gi) 86262133; nucleotides 442-1722], which was ampliﬁed by pcr. the coding region of mouse kvb3 (gi 17028407;
nucleotides 351-1565) was cloned into pcr3.1uni (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca) using pcr primers to introduce the myc tag

modulation of  xxxg1664xxx  drug sensitivity

sequence (atggagcagaagctgatctcagaggagg
acctg) at the 5¢ end of kvb3. the coding regions of  xxxg1664xxx 
and kvb3 were cloned downstream of the sp6 promoter into
the pcs2+ vector. the coding region of mouse kvb1.1 was
cloned into the vector pecfp-n1 (clontech ⁄ takara bio
usa, mountain view, ca, usa).

co-immunoprecipitation
transiently transfected n2a cells and non-transfected control cells were lysed 48 h after transfection using 500 ll of
lysis buffer (0.25 mm na- xxxd1835xxx , 150 mm nacl,
2 mm egta, 0.1 mm na3vo4, 10 mm naf, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride, 1% triton x-100, 50 mm
tris ⁄ hcl, ph 7.4). cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 9300 g at 4 c for 10 min. the supernatant was
cleared by incubation with 150 ll protein a sepharose
cl-4b (50% slurry, ge healthcare, little chalfont, uk)
at 4 c on a rotating wheel. the sepharose and non-speciﬁcally bound macromolecules were separated from the lysate
by centrifugation at 9300 g at 4 c for 5 min. each supernatant was divided into three parts and incubated with
anti-myc antibody (sigma, taufkirchen, germany) or antiha antibody (sigma) or without antibody (as a control).
the duration of incubation was 2–4 h at 4 c. next, 60 ll
of protein a sepharose was added and incubated overnight
at 4 c. protein–antibody–sepharose complexes were separated from unbound lysate by centrifugation at 2300 g at
4 c for 5 min, and complexes were washed six times for
1 min with 300 ll lysis buffer. the pulled-down proteins
were dissociated from the sepharose beads using 60 ll
laemmli buffer with heating to 95 c for 2 min. the supernatant was separated by 10% sds–page, followed by
immunodetection using either the myc or ha antibody.
the odyssey infrared imaging system (licor, lincoln,
ne, usa) was used for immunodetection.

antibody production
a kvb3-speciﬁc antibody was custom-made in chicken by
davids biotechnologie gmbh (regensburg, germany). to
ensure that the antibody is speciﬁc for kvb3 and to rule
out cross-reactivity with other subunits, a peptide sequence
from the n-terminal region corresponding to amino acids
22–40 (cgprpgpgggnggpvggghgn) of kvb3 was
used as antigen. the kvb3 antibody was igy-puriﬁed.

immunocytochemistry and
immunohistochemistry
immunocytochemistry on transfected n2a was performed
2 days after transfection. cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa) for 10 min and rinsed with nacl ⁄ pi. cell
membranes were permeabilized with 1% triton x-100 in

nacl ⁄ pi for 10 min. next, unspeciﬁc binding sites were
blocked by incubation in blocking solution (1% bsa, 3%
normal goat serum in nacl ⁄ pi) for 30 min. the anti-myc
antibody (sigma) and the generated kvb3 antibody were
used as primary antibodies. the primary antibody was
diluted in blocking solution, and incubation was performed
overnight at 4 c. cells were rinsed in nacl ⁄ pi containing
0.1% tween-20, and then incubated with species-speciﬁc secondary antibodies coupled with alexa fluor 488 and alexa
fluor 568 (molecular probes ⁄ invitrogen, carlsbad, ca,
usa), diluted in nacl ⁄ pi containing 0.1% tween-20, and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. finally, cells were
rinsed with nacl ⁄ pi containing 0.1% tween-20, and cover
slips were mounted using prolongantifade gold (molecular
probes). immunoperoxidase light microscopy on sections of
rat brain was performed as described previously [39].

synthesis of mrna and injection into
xenopus oocytes
the plasmids pcs2+- xxxg1664xxx  and pcs2+-kvb3 were linearized using noti, and in vitro transcription was performed
using the mmessage mmachine sp6 kit (ambion ⁄ applied biosystems, austin, tx, usa) according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines. the quantity of mrnas was
determined using uv absorbance (260 ⁄ 280 nm), and the
quality was controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis.
approximately 80 nl of the transcribed mrnas were
injected into xenopus oocytes. injected oocytes were incubated in or2 medium [82.5 mm nacl, 2.5 mm kcl,
1.0 mm mgcl2, 1.0 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm na2hpo4, 5.0 mm
hepes, and the antibiotics penicillin (10 000 uæml)1) and
streptomycin (10 mgæml)1), ph 7.5] at 18 c for 2–3 days.

electrophysiology
preparation of oocytes for voltage clamp analysis was performed as described previously [40]. a two-microelectrode
voltage clamp ampliﬁer (geneclamp 500b; axon instruments inc. ⁄ molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, usa) was
used for measuring the whole-cell membrane current of single oocytes, and a chart recorder (soltec, san fernando,
ca, usa) was used for recording. microelectrodes were
pulled from borosilicate glass using a vertical puller (david
kopf, tujunga, ca, usa), and ﬁlled with 3 m kcl. the
recording chamber was perfused continuously with or2
medium without antibiotics. membrane conductance was
determined using voltage pulses. oocytes were clamped to a
membrane potential of )30 mv, and depolarizing pulses of
5 s duration and 90 mv amplitude were applied to transiently open the channels. solutions of tcep (20 mm,
pierce, thermo fisher scientiﬁc, rockford, il, usa) were
prepared in ringer solution, and the ph was adjusted to
7.4. cbx (mp biomedicals, solon, oh, usa) was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in water and was diluted

6268

with or2 medium to achieve working concentrations
between 0.1 and 50 lm. probenecid [4-(dipropylsulfamoyl) xxxd306xxx ] (alfa aesar, karlsruhe, germany) was
used at a concentration of 1 mm.
the statistical signiﬁcance of the changes observed as a
result of drug application was tested by student’s t test
using sigmastat (sysstat software, san jose, ca). all
results are shown as mean ± standard deviation.
