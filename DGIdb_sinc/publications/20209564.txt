an in vitro assay to measure targeted drug delivery to
bone mineral

dedicated to prof. dr. horst kessler on the occasion of his 70th birthday.

targeted delivery of drugs to their site of action is a promising
strategy to decrease adverse effects and enhance efficacy, but
successful applications of this strategy have been scarce.
human bone is a tissue with unique properties due to its high
hydroxyapatite mineral content. however, with the exception
of bisphosphonates, bone mineral has not been targeted in a
successful clinical application of drugs that act on bone, such
as anti-resorptive or bone anabolic agents. herein we present
an nmr-based in vitro assay to measure binding affinities of
small molecules to hydroxyapatite (hap) or bone powder.
binding was shown to be specific and competitive, and the
assay can be carried out in a direct binding format or in competition mode. a selection of clinically relevant bisphosphonates was ranked by their binding affinity for hap. the binding

affinity decreases in the order:  xxxd2837xxx  > alendronate >
 xxxd3561xxx  >  xxxd3128xxx  >  xxxd2311xxx . the differences in
binding affinities span a factor of 2.1 between  xxxd2837xxx 
and  xxxd2311xxx , consistent with previous studies. the rank
order is very similar with bone powder, although the binding
capacity of bone powder is smaller and binding kinetics are
slower. a  xxxd3561xxx  derivative that lacks the central hydroxy
group binds to hap with 2.3-fold weaker affinity than  xxxd3561xxx  itself. any small molecule can be analyzed for its binding
to hap or bone powder, and the binding of common bonestaining agents such as alizarin and its derivatives was confirmed in the new assay. this assay supports a strategy for targeted delivery of drugs to bone by attaching a bone-affinity
tag to the active drug substance.

introduction
bisphosphonates (bps) are potent inhibitors of osteoclastic activity and are a well-known class of drugs that are widely used
to prevent bone loss associated with osteoporosis, paget’s disease, hypercalcemia, and metastatic bone disease (for reviews,
see refs. [1, 2]). at the biochemical level, the new generation of
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (n-bps, figure 1) inhibit
the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts and macrophages by
targeting  xxxg778xxx  ( xxxg778xxx ),[3–5] and the
precise molecular mechanism and structural interactions have
recently been elucidated.[6, 7] besides inhibiting  xxxg778xxx , bisphosphonates bind strongly to hydroxyapatite (hap), the
major mineral component of bone. this strong interaction targets bisphosphonates selectively to their desired site of action,
and decreases systemic exposure and concomitant adverse effects. in fact, pharmacokinetic studies show that approximately
50 % of absorbed or injected drug is rapidly taken up by the
skeleton and remains there with a long half-life, whereas the
rest is rapidly excreted unchanged via the kidney.[8] major differences in bone binding affinity could potentially affect the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bisphosphonate
drugs,[1, 2, 9, 10] and it is therefore important to measure their affinity for bone and to understand the structural details of binding.[11–13]
recently, determinations of bisphosphonate binding affinity
for bone powder or hap have been reported from in vitro
assays that have been set up in three formats: 1) a radioactive
competition assay using 14c-alendronate,[14] 2) inhibition of
hap crystal growth using a constant composition method,[15, 16]

770

and 3) retention of small molecules on a hap column as measured by fplc.[17] each of these methods has its advantages
and drawbacks, and because the rank order of bisphosphonates is not identical across these assays, an independent
method is valuable, especially if it is robust and generally applicable to a wide range of binding affinities. the nmr-based
method presented herein fulfills these criteria and yields a precise rank order of clinically used n-bps, both for binding to
hap and bone powder. in addition, it is shown that the
method can be applied to non-bisphosphonate compounds
such as alizarin, tetracycline, or other bone-staining dyes. this
assay thus supports a strategy to target active substances selectively to bone by tethering to them a bone-affinity tag, and
facilitates this approach by identifying suitable attachment
points in alizarin to which active substances can be tethered
without loss in bone affinity.

results
direct binding assay and assay validation
as a first step in developing the novel in vitro assay, we studied specificity, saturation, and competition behavior of bisphosphonate binding to hydroxyapatite (hap). in the simplest
assay format, an aqueous solution with a known concentration
of bisphosphonate is incubated for a defined period of time
with hap. bound bisphosphonate is then removed by centrifugation, and the bisphosphonate remaining in solution is quantified by nmr. in practice, a large aqueous stock solution of
bisphosphonate is prepared to ensure identical starting concentrations. half of this stock is then incubated with hap, centrifuged, and quantified by nmr, while the other half is not incubated and is directly quantified by nmr. differences in solution concentrations upon incubation with hap directly reflect
binding of the bisphosphonate to hap (figure 2). this approach takes advantage of the fact that the integral of an nmr
signal is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance in solution, and that quantification of one compound is
not perturbed by the presence of other compounds, so that
each individual compound can be quantified directly out of a
mixture of compounds.
in order for this assay to be meaningful, compound binding
to hap must be specific, saturable, and competitive. several
controls were run to ensure that this is the case and to fully
characterize the system. binding specificity was established by
the complete lack of affinity between hap and a variety of unrelated compounds. in fact, we screened a set of 500 compounds from our fragment library,[18] which we commonly use
chemmedchem 2010, 5, 770 – 776

figure 3. specificity control for the hap binding assay. a mixture of unrelated compounds from our fragment library was incubated with hap, and
showed no binding affinity. the concentration of each fragment was 50 mm,
and 2.57 mg hap was added for the spectrum shown with the thin line.

competitive binding to hap was proven by the following
experiment: an aliquot of hap was incubated with excess deoxyzoledronate (deoxy-zol), which was predicted—and later
confirmed—to be a bisphosphonate with weaker binding affinity for hap. hap loaded with deoxy-zol was washed three
times with aqueous buffer until the washing buffer contained
no trace of deoxy-zol, as determined by the absence of
deoxy-zol nmr signals in the washing buffer.  xxxd3128xxx  in
solution was then added in excess to deoxy-zol-loaded hap,
and the solution was analyzed. importantly, besides excess unbound  xxxd3128xxx , the solution contained significant amounts
of deoxy-zol, which was displaced from hap (supporting information figure 1). detailed calculations showed that deoxyzol was nearly quantitatively displaced by an excess of  xxxd3128xxx . these control experiments proved that binding of bisphosphonates to hap is specific, saturable, and competitive.

assay in competition format
displacement of a weaker-binding bisphosphonate (deoxyzol) by a stronger-binding bisphosphonate ( xxxd3128xxx ) unambiguously demonstrated the competitive binding behavior
of bisphosphonates, which is the basis for a competition assay.
most other research groups report having found only small differences in bisphosphonate binding affinity for hap between
the various bisphosphonates.[14–17, 19] because small differences
are more accurately detected in direct competition assays, we
adapted our nmr-based assay to a competition format. in this
format, a mixture of the two compounds under investigation is
prepared and incubated with limiting amounts of hap (or
bone powder). the limiting quantity of hap or bone powder is
key for the distinction, and ensures that both compounds
compete for binding. the compound with higher affinity will
bind preferentially, and quantification of the respective percentages of bound compound allows direct conclusions about the
relative binding affinity. the principle of the competition
format is depicted in figure 4. in the case of large differences
in hap affinity (a), one compound binds completely before the
second compound starts to bind upon addition of hap. in the
case of equal binding affinity (b), both bisphosphonates bind
indistinguishably. in the general case of slightly different binding affinity (c), the relative binding affinity can be determined
from the relative percentages of bound compound. this
format is very similar to the recently proposed method for
nmr-based ranking of ligand affinity for a protein target.[20]
the competition format is very useful if small differences in
binding affinities are to be detected. this is, for example, the
case for bisphosphonates, and the various clinically used bisphosphonates could be unambiguously ranked for their hap
binding affinity, although all bind with similar affinity (see section below). figure 5 shows the differentiation between  xxxd3128xxx  and  xxxd2837xxx  in the competition format assay.

the left part; the aliphatic protons of  xxxd2837xxx  are shown at right. the
solid line corresponds to the spectrum without hap, and the dotted line to
the spectrum with hap, which is slightly shifted to the right for clarity. from
the differences, the relative percentage of bound bisphosphonate, and thus
the relative binding affinities, can be estimated as: affinitypam/affinityris = 60 %/32 % = 1.85.

ranking of bisphosphonates by their affinity for hap
affinity for bone mineral is an important factor for the clinical
efficacy of bisphosphonates. all bisphosphonates have high affinity for bone mineral, but small differences are present due
to small effects from the various side chains. considerable efforts have been spent in measuring these small differences,
but no published method has proven precise and accurate
enough to unambiguously distinguish all bisphosphonates
from one another.
the novel nmr-based assay in its competition format is able
to distinguish the affinities of the various bisphosphonates. for
this purpose, the affinities for hap of five clinically used bis-

targeted drug delivery to bone mineral
phosphonates ( xxxd3561xxx ,  xxxd2311xxx ,  xxxd3128xxx , alendronate, and  xxxd2837xxx ) were measured in competition experiments. bisphosphonates were measured pairwise in competition mode, and the relative affinities were determined as
shown in figure 5. the difference in affinities and the ranking
of bisphosphonates according to their hap binding affinity is
illustrated in figure 6. the bisphosphonate with highest affinity
for hap is  xxxd2837xxx , followed by alendronate,  xxxd3561xxx ,
 xxxd3128xxx , and  xxxd2311xxx . we estimate an error of about
10 % for each of the relative affinity determinations. this error
estimation comes primarily from inaccuracies in weighing and
from differential solvent or salt content of bisphosphonate
powder. the error from the nmr analysis is smaller and can be
minimized by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio with increased measurement time.

also been ranked by their affinity for bone powder, and the
result is shown in figure 6 (right side). the relative ranking of
bisphosphonates is almost identical between hap and bone
powder; only the two neighboring bisphosphonates,  xxxd2837xxx  and alendronate, have changed places. the exact reason
for this slight change is unclear, but is probably related to the
presence of other protein and mineral components in bone
powder. we also observed that about three times the amount
of bone powder was needed to bind the same quantities of
bisphosphonate, and that binding kinetics were slower: with
bone powder, we had to wait 15 min for equilibrium to be
reached, whereas with hap, equilibrium was established in less
than 5 min. these observations are explained by the presence
of bone components other than hap in bone powder, and by
the larger particle sizes present in bone powder, which requires longer diffusion times.

n-bps for binding to hap (left) or bone powder (right). the numbers at right
in each case give the pairwise relative affinities.

comparison of  xxxd3561xxx  and deoxyzoledronate
as shown above, the affinities to hap of all clinical n-bps are
very similar and vary only within a factor of 2. it is of interest
to assess the hap binding of deoxybisphosphonate analogues,
such as deoxyzoledronate. the
general belief is that the central
hydroxy group is essential for
strong binding to bone,[21] as it
allows chelation of the calcium
ions in hap through tridentate
rather than bidentate interactions.[22] our data show that the
absence of the central hydroxy
group does indeed decrease the
affinity for hap significantly, although the difference in hap affinity between zol and deoxyzol is only another factor of 2.3
(figure 7).

bone-staining agents are often used in bone research to mark
areas of active bone remodeling. commonly used bone-staining agents include alizarin and tetracycline. we investigated
the binding of alizarin and alizarin derivatives to hap. although
direct binding of the compounds to bone appears necessary
for their bone-staining properties, we wanted to confirm binding experimentally because the chemical structures of alizarin
and tetracycline bear little similarity to bisphosphonates. direct
binding of alizarin and tetracycline to hap would mean that
hap recognizes at least two different pharmacophores: one is
the bisphosphonate moiety, and the other is rich in chinoid
and hydrochinoid substructures and is exemplified by alizarin.

the binding of alizarin was tested in the direct binding
format, and alizarin was indeed found to bind hap, albeit with
a greater than 10-fold decreased binding affinity relative to
 xxxd2311xxx , the most weakly binding bisphosphonate of the
present study. the binding of alizarin red to hap was found to
be stronger than alizarin, but still much weaker than  xxxd2311xxx . this result confirms the direct binding of alizarin to hap,
establishes the presence of at least two pharmacophores for
hap binding, and demonstrates the general applicability of the
new bone binding assay over a range of binding affinities and
compound classes.

a strategy for targeted delivery of active substances to
bone
several attempts have been made to target an active substance to bone by attaching to it a bone binding moiety.[23–25]
however, in most reported cases, the bone binding moiety
was a bisphosphonate or bisphosphonate derivative.[25–32] although its high affinity for bone is desirable, the polar and
very hydrophilic nature of the bisphosphonate moiety is expected to severely compromise the oral bioavailability of such
drug conjugates. in contrast, non-ionic, non-bisphosphonate
bone binding moieties such as alizarin or tetracycline elements,[33–35] which we term bone-affinity tags in order to distinguish them from the polar and charged bisphosphonates, hold
the potential to target an active substance to bone while retaining oral bioavailability for the drug adduct.
realization of this concept requires the identification of suitable attachment points on both the active substance and the
bone-affinity tag for their subsequent linkage. these attachment points are atoms on the molecules to which additional
chemical groups can be tethered covalently, while binding affinity for hap is retained. for the case of alizarin, a number of
analogues were tested in order to identify such attachment
points, and alizarin analogues such as compound 1 (figure 8)
were discovered to which an active drug can be attached via
ester, ether, or aliphatic linkage. note that 1 has its hydroxy
groups at different positions than alizarin, indicating tolerability at this position for the sar of hap binding. such a com-

pound would be a useful starting point for a bone-affinity tag,
and the nmr-based assay described herein can be used to
follow the bone affinity of the tethered compounds. we believe that with improved bone-affinity tags and a robust assay
to measure bone binding, the concept of bone targeting
should be revisited and will ultimately be successful.

discussion
rank order of bisphosphonate binding affinity for hap and
bone powder
the current study describes a straightforward and robust assay
to determine binding affinities of small molecules to hap or
bone powder. the assay can be carried out in either a direct
binding format or in a competition format. the competition
format is much preferred for the study of bisphosphonates, as
the subtle differences in binding affinities of various clinical
bisphosphonates are most precisely and accurately measured
in this format. in principle, any analytical method, including
lc–ms or lc–uv, could be used to quantify the amount of test
compound bound to hap or bone powder (and therefore not
present any more in solution).[33, 35] nmr spectroscopy has the
advantage that no protocol is required for the separation and
detection of the substance. instead, each component can be
readily quantified directly from the mixture, and solution concentrations simply correlate with the peak integrals. the presence of other compounds in the mixture does not interfere
with quantification. particularly for bisphosphonates and other
highly charged molecules, chromatographic separation and
quantitative detection is not straightforward. this makes nmr
detection highly suitable for the hap assay in competition
mode. a drawback of nmr detection is the required compound solubility of at least 10 mm (ideally 50 mm).
the method presented herein is among the most precise determinations of relative binding affinities of bisphosphonates.
experimental errors are estimated  xxxd1891xxx  % and are small
enough to discriminate most of the small differences in binding affinities of the various bisphosphonates in clinical use. our
data indicate that any differences in binding affinity of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are small: the binding affinities between the strongest ( xxxd2837xxx ) and weakest ( xxxd2311xxx ) bisphosphonates differ only by a factor of 2.1. within
this small range, the rank order of binding affinities to hap is
 xxxd2837xxx  > alendronate >  xxxd3561xxx  >  xxxd3128xxx  >
 xxxd2311xxx . this rank order, and the roughly twofold range in
binding affinity, are almost preserved when binding to bone
powder is considered; only  xxxd2837xxx  and alendronate have
changed places.
previous determinations of bisphosphonate affinity for hap
or bone powder have also generally found only small differences for the clinically used bisphosphonates studied
here.[10, 14–17, 19, 21, 22] leu et al.[14] used a radioactive 14c-alendronate displacement assay with human bone powder and derived the rank order: alendronate >  xxxd3561xxx    xxxd2837xxx    xxxd3128xxx  >  xxxd2311xxx . the experimental error in
this study was too large to reach significance for all bisphos-

targeted drug delivery to bone mineral
phonates, but except for  xxxd2837xxx , this rank order is identical
to the rank order we observed, using a completely independent method. intriguingly,  xxxd2837xxx  was the only bisphosphonate that behaved in a slightly different manner with hap
and bone powder in our studies, and bound slightly less tightly to bone powder than to hap, coming close to the results of
leu et al.[14] furthermore, leu et al. found an affinity span of a
factor of 1.9 between alendronate and  xxxd2311xxx , which is
very similar to the affinity span we found, 2.1 for hap and 1.95
for bone powder. nancollas et al.[15] monitored hap crystal
growth using a constant composition method, and also found
small yet significant differences between the various n-bps,
with an affinity span of 1.6. the rank order derived in this investigation was  xxxd3561xxx  > alendronate >  xxxd2311xxx  >
 xxxd3128xxx . although this is different from the rank orders of
leu et al.[14] and our study, the general agreement is remarkable, given the different assay setup and readout, namely a kinetic measurement of crystal growth inhibition in the case of
nancollas et al.,[15] and a thermodynamic measurement of
binding affinity in the case of leu et al.[14] and our study. recently, yet another method was introduced by lawson et al.[17]
to study bisphosphonate–hap interactions by measuring the
retention of bisphosphonates on a hap column using fplc.[27]
of the clinically used n-bps, only  xxxd3561xxx  and  xxxd3128xxx 
were studied with this system, and a 1.4-fold difference in retention time (22.0 min for  xxxd3561xxx ; 16.2 min for  xxxd3128xxx ) was observed. although this difference appears large, it
is unknown how differences in retention time can be translated into differences in binding affinity. moreover, the fplcbased assay is a flow system, whereas all other assays are
based on static systems. finally, mukherjee et al.[11] studied bisphosphonate–bone powder interactions using isothermal titration calorimetry, and came up with a rank order of alendronate
>  xxxd2837xxx  >  xxxd3561xxx  >  xxxd3128xxx , which is identical to the rank order that we obtained for bone powder. taken
together, bisphosphonate interactions with hap or bone
powder have been studied using an impressive arsenal of technologies, and considering the differences in assay setup, observed properties, and readout parameters, the results of all
these investigations appear to give a converging picture of
these interactions. our conclusions add to the array of technologies by which bisphosphonate–hap interactions are studied.
they confirm previous results, and add new insights by being
the first study to compare head-to-head bisphosphonate binding to hap and bone powder, and by adding high precision to
the measurements of these interactions. it remains to be seen
whether the small differences between the various n-bps have
any significance for the clinical pharmacology or pharmacokinetics of these drugs.
bone-affinity tags for targeted delivery of active substances
to bone
in a sense, bisphosphonates are ideal drugs because they rapidly and strongly bind to bone at sites of rapid bone turnover,
and are thus targeted exactly to their desired site of action. although it was initially thought that stabilization of the bone
chemmedchem 2010, 5, 770 – 776

surface by mere physicochemical effects protected bone from
resorption, it is now known that biochemical effects, namely
inhibition of  xxxg778xxx  ( xxxg778xxx ) in the
mevalonate pathway of osteoclasts, are primarily responsible
for the pharmacological effect of n-bps. this leads to the conclusion that the targeting of bisphosphonates to their desired
site of action is a fortunate coincidence: the pharmacophore
for  xxxg778xxx  inhibition happens to match the pharmacophore for
bone binding, explained by the fact that biosynthesis of prenyl
groups happens to proceed via pyrophosphate intermediates.
drugs other than bisphosphonates, or drug candidates that
modulate bone metabolism, are generally not targeted to
bone, although bone targeting would possibly decrease their
adverse effects by minimizing systemic exposure. for example,
bone-targeted analogues of  xxxg2198xxx  kinase,[36] colony-stimulating
factor 1 receptor ( xxxg525xxx ), selective  xxxg183xxx  modulators (sarms),[37] selective  xxxg730xxx  modulators
(serms),[23] or  xxxd1903xxx  modulators[38] have the potential to show enhanced safety and efficacy relative to the original non-bone-targeted modulators. such an approach has
been taken,[25–32, 39] but the bone-targeting moieties were bisphosphonates or bisphosphonate derivatives with their wellknown negative effects on physicochemical properties and
oral bioavailability. alternatively, a peptide consisting of a sequence of basic amino acids (asp)6 was used as a carrier for
drug delivery to bone,[40] targeting the non-collagenous proteins that constitute the organic component of bone.
with the non-bisphosphonate and in fact non-ionic bone-affinity tags proposed herein, which may be based on known
bone-staining agents such as alizarin or tetracycline,[33–35] efficient bone targeting may be achieved while retaining oral bioavailability and cellular permeability. although the potential
metabolic and toxic effects of such bone-affinity tags will have
to be studied in detail, the benefits of bone targeting may outweigh its drawbacks. the nmr-based assay presented herein
further expands the versatility of nmr in drug discovery research,[41] and could provide a useful tool to monitor the bone
affinity of active substance conjugates.

experimental section
hydroxyapatite (ceramic hydroxyapatite, type i, 20 mm) was purchased from biorad, and bone powder (bone powder washed, cat.
no. 501093) was purchased from gimborn gmbh, emmerich (germany). alizarin and alizarin red were purchased from sigma. all
other compounds were obtained from the novartis compound archive.
for bisphosphonate binding experiments with hydroxyapatite,
solutions (1.4 ml) of bisphosphonate (50 mm in aqueous buffer
containing 50 mm d-tris ph 7.5, and 10 % d2o) were divided into
two aliquots. one aliquot was incubated with hap (0.2–0.3 mg) for
5 min, centrifuged, and measured by nmr. the other aliquot was
treated identically, but not mixed with hap. bisphosphonate concentrations in both aliquots were then determined by one-dimensional 1h nmr on a bruker drx600 spectrometer operating at a frequency of 600 mhz, using excitation sculpting for water suppression. the recycle delay was 3 s. note that artifacts from incomplete
relaxation are eliminated by normalizing the intensities to the

same compound mixture without hap incubation. also “saltingout” effects from limited compound solubilities in the presence of
other compounds are eliminated by this procedure. the total
measuring time for each sample was typically 20 min.
for bisphosphonate binding experiments with bone powder,
the protocol was identical except that 0.7–0.8 mg bone powder
was used instead of hap, and the incubation time was 15 min.
for alizarin binding experiments with hydroxyapatite, the protocol was identical except that only one compound was measured at
a time (direct binding format instead of competition format) and
5 mg hap was used. the incubation time was 30 min, and alizarin
and analogues were dissolved as a stock solution in acetonitrile.
