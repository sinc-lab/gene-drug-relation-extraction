effect of famotidineon gastriclesionsis attributablenot only to suppressionof acid
secretionbut to activationof the gastricmucosaldefensivemechanisms.

histamine h2-receptor antagonists,  xxxd2082xxx , cimetidine and ranitidine, have been
shown to be effective in preventing the formation of gastric mucosal lesions in rats (1-3)
and in promoting the healing in rat (2, 4) and
human ulcers (5 -7). the mechanisms by
which h2-receptor antagonists suppress experimental lesions are thought to be secondary
to their potent gastric acid antisecretory activity (1, 3). however, cimetidine and ranitidine
blocked acidified aspirin-induced gastric lesions in rats in doses that do not suppress acid
secretion (8, 9), suggesting that mechanisms
other than inhibition of acid secretion might
be involved in their mucosal protective activ-

ity.
 xxxd2082xxx  has been reported to be a potent h2-receptor antagonist in vitro (10-12)
and in vivo (4, 13) with greater antisecretory
activity than cimetidine and ranitidine (3, 14,
15).  xxxd2082xxx  has also been reported to inhibit the gastric mucosal lesions that were dependent on gastric acid (2-4). the aims of
this investigation were to examine the effect of
 xxxd2082xxx  on the formation of gastric mucosal
lesions induced by the decrease in mucosal defensive factors in comparison with cimetidine,
 xxxd2965xxx  and cetraxate.

materials and methods
materials
 xxxd2082xxx , cimetidine and  xxxd2965xxx 
hydrochloride were synthesized in our laboratories. cetraxate hydrochloride was extracted
and purified from neuer r capsule s (daiichi
pharmaceutical). each drug was suspended
with 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx  solution and administered to rats at a volume of 5 ml/kg. drugs
used for induction of gastric lesions were
 xxxd3296xxx  (sigma chemical), histamine dihydrochloride (wako pure chemical),
serotonin creatinine sulfate (e. merck), aspirin (sanko pharmaceutical), indomethacin
(yamanouchi pharmaceutical) and iodoacetamide (tokyokasei).  xxxd3296xxx , histamine
and serotonin, and iodoacetamide were dissolved in distilled water, physiological saline
and tap water, respectively. aspirin was suspended with 150 mm hci. indomethacin was
suspended with physiological saline containing
0.2% tween 80. other drugs used were trypsin (sigma chemical), glucose (nacalai tesque) and glucosamine (sigma chemical).
gastric lesion production
 xxxd3296xxx -induced gastric lesion: male
wistar rats weighing 200 to 230 g were deprived of food but allowed free access to water
for 24 hr before the experiments. acute gastric lesions were induced by  xxxd3296xxx 
alone and in the combination with histamine
or serotonin. just after 30 mm  xxxd3296xxx 
was given intragastrically in a 1-ml volume,
histamine was injected i.p. in a dose of 100
mg/kg or serotonin was injected subcutaneously in a dose of 20 mg/kg. four hours
later, the animals were killed by chloroform,
and the stomach was removed. the area
(mm2) of each lesion was measured macroscopically, summed per stomach, and used as
a lesion index. drugs were given orally 1 hr
before  xxxd3296xxx  administration.
aspirin or  xxxd102xxx induced gastric lesion:
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 210 to 230
g were deprived of food and water for 24 hr
before the experiments. gastric lesions were

caused by acidified (150 mm hci) aspirin in a
dose of 150 mg/kg, i.g., or 60% ethanol, i.g.,
containing 150 mm hcl (acidified ethanol).
one hour after i.g.-administration of acidified
aspirin or acidified ethanol in a 1-ml volume
to rats, the animals were killed by chloroform
and the stomach was removed. the length
(mm) of each lesion was measured macroscopically, summed per stomach, and used as
a lesion index. drugs were given orally 1 hr
before ulcerogens administration.
in another series of experiments to evaluate
the involvement of endogenous prostaglandins, indomethacin was subcutaneously injected to rats 1 hr before drug administration.
iodoacetamide-induced gastric lesion: male
wistar rats weighing 200 to 230 g were used
for production of gastric lesions by iodoacetamide according to the method of szabo et al.
(16). briefly, rats were placed in individual
mesh cages to prevent coprophagy with free
access to food and water. gastric lesion was
caused by 0.1% iodoacetamide in drinking
water given to rats for 7 days; and on the 8th
day, rats were sacrificed by chloroform, and
the stomach was removed. the length (mm)
of each lesion was measured macroscopically,
summed per stomach, and used as a lesion index. test compounds were given orally once
daily to rats during the 7 days.
gastric acid secretion
male wistar rats weighing 200 to 230 g were
deprived of food, but allowed free access to
tap water for 24 hr before the experiments.
with the rats under ether anesthesia, the
abdomen was incised, and the pylorus was ligated. they were placed in individual mesh
cages to prevent coprophagy. four hours later, the animals were killed by chloroform,
and the gastric contents were analyzed for
volume and acidity. acidity of the gastric juice
was determined by titration with 0.05 n
naoh using an automatic titrator (hiranuma,
comtite-7) to an endpoint ph of 7.0. in
another series of experiments to examine the
influence of histamine against gastric secretion
in pylorus-ligated rats, histamine at a dose of

100 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected to
the rats immediately after the abdomen was
sutured. test compounds were given orally 1
hr before pylorus ligation.
measurement of gastric mucosal blood flow
male sprague-dawley rats weighing 200 to
240 g were deprived of food with free access
to water for 24 hr before the experiments.
under urethane (1.25 g/kg, i.p.) anesthesia,
the trachea was cannulated and the abdomen
was opened. the esophagus was ligated without disturbing the vagus nerves. gastric
mucosal blood flow was measured using a laser doppler blood flowmeter (tsi, laserflo;
bpm403) according to the method of saita et
al. (17). the optical flow probe was inserted
into the stomach through a temporary gastric
fistula, which was prepared
using a
polyethylene tube, in the forestomach and was
placed on the gastric mucosa. the probe was
mounted in a commercially available balancer
(physio-tech). approximately 30 min after
anesthesia, 60% ethanol containing 150 mm
hcl in a 1-m] volume was intragastrically
administered through a gastric fistula. the
changes in gastric mucosal blood flow was
continuously monitored. drugs were given
orally 30 min before urethane anesthesia.
measurement of the transgastric potential difference (pd)
the experimental procedure was essentially
the same as that described by takeuchi and
okabe (18). male sprague-dawley rats
weighing 200 to 250 g were derived of food for
24 hr but water was allowed ad libitum. after
anesthesia with urethane (1.25 g/kg, i.p.), the
trachea of the rat was cannulated. the abdomen was opened and the stomach was exposed. the esophagus was ligated without disturbing the vagus nerves. a temporary gastric
fistula was prepared using a polyethylene tube
in the forestomach. the fistula that led to a
three-way tap was used for intragastric instillation and removal of gastric contents and for
continuous
intraluminal
perfusion
with
warmed saline. the pyloroduodenal junction

was exposed, and two catheters were passed
into the stomach through an incision in the
duodenum and were held in place by a ligature around the pylorus. one catheter, which
was filled with 4% agar in saturated kci,
served as the intragastric electrode. the circuit
for the pd recording was coupled with an indifferent electrode placed in the abdominal
cavity filled with saline. both the intragastric
and intraperitoneal electrodes were placed in
separate beakers containing saturated kcl
solution in which a balanced ag-agci electrode was positioned. the changes in pd were
continuously monitored using a recorder
(rikadenki, r-52) connected to the millivoltometer (toa electronics, hm-16s). the second
gastric catheter led to a ph glass electrode of
the flow type (toa electronics, gs-80) to determine the changes in ph of fluids emerging
from the pylorus and which was connected to
a ph meter (toa electronics, hm-16s) for
simultaneous measurement of the changes in
pd. the whole interior of the stomach
was gently rinsed with warmed saline 3 to
4 times, and then 3 ml of saline was instilled
into the stomach. the perfusion of warmed
saline (2 ml/min) was controlled by a peristaltic pump (taitec, n-18) located at the middle
of entry or exit tube connected to the fistula
or to the ph glass electrode.
approximately 30 min after anesthesia, the
perfusion system was interrupted, and the
solution in the stomach was withdrawn. the
stomach was then exposed for 10 min to 3 ml
of acidified ethanol. after acidified ethanol
exposure, the stomach was gently rinsed again
several times, another 3 ml of saline was instilled, and the perfusion system was resumed.
drugs were given orally 30 min before
urethane anesthesia.
measurement of the contents of gastric mucosal
glycoprotein
male wistar rats weighing 200 to 240 g were
deprived of food but allowed free access to
tap water for 18 hr before the study. the
stress condition was evoked by placing the
animals in individual compartments of the spe-

cial stress cages and then immersing them in a
water bath at 23-'c for 7 hr to the xyphoid
level as described by takagi and okabe (19).
after the animals were killed by chloroform,
the stomachs were removed, placed in ice-cold
physiological saline solution, and opened
along the greater curvature. the gastric corpus
wall was then placed between two glass slides
and frozen by immersion in hexane cooled in
a dry ice-ethanol bath. the gastric mucosa was
separated from its underlying muscle layer by
pulling the two glass slides apart and then
weighed. the frozen mucosa was homogenized
in 2.5 ml of water with a polytron homogenizer. the resultant homogenate was digested
with trypsin (0.5 mg) for 20 hr at 37°c and
centrifuged to eliminate non-digestable components. a portion of the supernatant was
hydrolyzed in conc-hcl in a sealed ampoule at
110°c for 16 hr. hexoses in the hydrolyzate
were assayed colorimetrically using the
anthrone-h2so4 method (20). hexosamine in
the hydrolyzate was also assayed colorimetrically after separation through a dowex 50 column. glucose and glucosamine were used as
the standard for calibration, respectively.
statistics
all values represent the mean ± standard
error of the mean (s.e.m.), and the statistical
significance was determined by analysis of
variance (anova) or student's t-test. the
differences between treatment groups were
compared by the neuman-keuls multiple
range test. probabilities of < 5% (p < 0.05)
were considered significant. the doses producing 50% inhibition of acid secretion or gastric
lesion (ed50 values) were determined by logprobit analysis from data obtained for 3 doses
of each compound.

(10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) also inhibited dosedependently these lesions in rats. cetraxate
(100-1000 mg/kg, p.o.) produced dose-dependent inhibition against  xxxd3296xxx -histamine-induced lesions, whereas cetraxate did
not affect  xxxd3296xxx -serotonin-induced gastric lesions at oral doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg
and inhibited them by 68. 1% at 300 mg/kg.
effect on acidified aspirin-induced gastric lesion
intragastric administration of acidified aspirin produced hemorrhagic damage along the
long axis of the stomach, and the lesion index
was 32.6 ± 5.4 mm. oral administration of
 xxxd2082xxx  (0.3 and 1 mg/kg), cimetidine (3 to
30 mg/kg),  xxxd2965xxx  (10 to 100 mg/kg) and
cetraxate (30 to 300 mg/kg) produced a significant inhibition against acidified aspirininduced lesion in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 3). the ed50 values for  xxxd2082xxx ,
cimetidine,  xxxd2965xxx  and cetraxate were
0.14 (0.12-0.16), 4.1 (3.5-4.7), 30.8 (21.145.0) and 45.2 (21.4-95.8) mg/kg, p.o., respectively.

represents the mean ± s.e.m. for 9- 10 rats. the
statistical significance was determined by anova
(*:p<0.05,**:p<0.01).

effect on acidified  xxxd102xxx induced gastric lesion
when acidified ethanol was given to the
control animals, multiple severe lesions were
induced in the glandular portion, and the le-

sion index was 54.0 ± 5.6 mm.  xxxd2082xxx  at
0.3 to 1 mg/kg, p.o., inhibited gastric lesions,
and the degrees of inhibition were 50.2 and
44.4%, respectively. cimetidine at a dose of
100 mg/kg, p.o., inhibited the lesion formation by 53.7%. in contrast,  xxxd2965xxx  and
cetraxate  xxxd1891xxx  to 100 mg/kg, p.o., dose-dependently inhibited the lesion formation induced by acidified ethanol with ed50 values of
21.2 (17.6 - 25.5) and 50.6 (30.0 - 85.3) mg/kg,
p.o. (fig. 4).

significance was determined by anova (**: p <
0.01).

effect on iodoacetamide-induced gastric lesion
in the control animals, mild erosion was induced in the upper glandular portion (mainly
in the corpus) by 0.1% iodoacetamide in
drinking water for 7 days with a lesion index
of 11.9 ± 1.1 mm. oral administration of
 xxxd2082xxx  to rats once daily for 7 days significantly showed a preventive effect on
iodoacetamide-induced gastric lesion. the degrees of inhibition were 52.9 and 56.3% at the
dose of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, p.o., respectively.
treatment with orally administered  xxxd2965xxx  and cetraxate also significantly prevented
gastric lesions in response to iodoacetamide,
the degrees of inhibition being 55.2% by
 xxxd2965xxx  at 100 mg/kg and 58.0% by cetraxate at 300 mg/kg. cimetidine at a dose of
100 mg/kg once daily for 7 days did not significantly protect the gastric mucosa against

iodoacetamide-induced lesion, the degree of
inhibiton being 33.6% (fig. 5).

fig. 5. effects of  xxxd2082xxx , cimetidine,  xxxd2965xxx 
and cetraxate on 0.1% iodoacetamide-induced gastric

was given to rats for 7 days and on the 8th day, rats
were sacrificed. test compounds were given once daily
to rats during the 7 days. each point represents the
mean ± s.e.m. for 10 rats. the statistical significance
was determined by anova (*: p < 0.05, **: p <
0.01).

secretion with eds() values of 23.3 (10.054.2), 21.9 (19.0-25.3) and 143.9 (132.3156.6) mg/kg, p.o., respectively.
total acid output was increased by approximately 20% compared with basal acid output
by i.p. injection of histamine at a dose of 100
mg/kg in pylorus-ligated rats.  xxxd2082xxx  and
cimetidine inhibited gastric acid secretion induced by histamine in a dose-dependent manner with ed50 values of 0.06 (0.04-0.09)
and 6.8 (5.5-8.3) mg/kg, p.o., respectively.
in contrast, pretreatment with  xxxd2965xxx  and
cetraxate showed a weak antisecretory effect
on histamine-stimulated acid secretion in
pylorus-ligated rats and the degrees of inhibition were 22.6 ± 4.8% at 30 mg/kg, p.o., of
 xxxd2965xxx  and 43.0 ± 9.7% at 100 mg/kg,
p.o., of cetraxate (table 1).
effect on gastric mucosal blood flow
the basal blood flow of the gastric mucosa
was 112.2 ± 4.4 ml/100 g tissue/min in anesthetized rats. oral administrations of  xxxd2082xxx  (0.1 to 1 mg/kg, p.o.) and cimetidine (30
and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) had no significant effect
on the basal blood flow (data not shown). as
shown in fig. 6, intragastric application of acidified ethanol produced a sustained decrease
in gastric mucosal blood flow.  xxxd2082xxx ,

in blood flow at 30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o., and
increased blood flow at 100 mg/kg, p.o.
effect on the transgastric pd
the transgastric pd (mucosa negative) was
significantly increased by oral administration
of  xxxd2082xxx  at a dose of 1 mg/kg. the pd
was significantly decreased in response to intragastric application of 3 ml acidified ethanol
for 10 min, and it decreased after removal of
the solution from the stomach and remained
lowered for about 1 hr.  xxxd2082xxx  at a dose
of 1 mg/kg promoted the recovery of decreased transgastric pd. on the other hand,
cimetidine (100 mg/kg, p.o.) did not affect the
basal pd or the responses caused by acidified
ethanol (fig. 7). although the basal ph was
significantly higher in the drug-treated groups,
the ph changes were not influenced by  xxxd2082xxx  (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, p.o.) and cimetidine
(100 mg/kg, p.o.) after acidified ethanol expo-

sure (data not shown).

effect on the contents of gastric mucosal glycoprotein
the contents of gastric mucosal hexosamine
and hexose were 372.7 ± 19.3 and 168.7 ± 6.8
,ug/100 mg tissue in normal rats, respectively,
and were reduced to 76.5 and 79.5% by water
immersion restraint stress.  xxxd2082xxx  at 1
mg/kg, p.o., inhibited the decreases of hexosamine and hexose induced by stress by 73.7
and 76.9%, respectively. cimetidine at 30
mg/kg, p.o., also inhibited the decreases of
these glycoproteins by 53.9 and 64.7%, respectively.
involvement of endogenous prostaglandins
the formation of acidified  xxxd102xxx induced
gastric mucosal lesions was aggravated from
55.6 ± 4.5 to 90.2 ± 3.2 mm by the pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, s.c.) in
rats. oral  xxxd2082xxx  at a dose of 1 mg/kg and
cimetidine at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed
almost the same inhibitory proportion on
indomethacin-acidified  xxxd102xxx induced lesions
as that on acidified ethanol induced lesions.
on the contrary, the inhibitory effect of 20%

discussion
peptic ulcer is well accepted to be caused by
an imbalance between the mucosal defensive
factors and the aggressive factors of acid and
pepsin (21). the mechanisms by which an h2receptor antagonist, cimetidine, suppresses experimental lesions are thought to be secondary
to its potent gastric acid antisecretory activity
(1).  xxxd2082xxx  has also been reported to inhibit the gastric mucosal lesions induced by
water immersion-restraint stress, indomethacin
and pylorus-ligation that were all dependent
on gastric acid (2-4). a muscarinic m,-receptor antagonist,  xxxd2965xxx , has been shown to
inhibit gastric secretion, improve gastric
mucosal microcirculation, and protect gastric
mucus contents, resulting in the prevention of
gastric lesion formation (22-24). it is reported that the cytoprotection by  xxxd2965xxx 
might not be due to endogenous prostaglandins but be due to a direct action on the gastric mucosa (25). it is also reported that the
prevention by cetraxate of experimental gastric lesions may be attributable to its ability to
reinforce the gastric mucosal defensive factors
such as microcirculation (26) and mucus glycoproteins (27) through a release of endogenous prostaglandins (28), although cetraxate
has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect
on the gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats
(29).
in the present study, acute gastric lesions
were introduced by  xxxd3296xxx -histamine,
 xxxd3296xxx -serotonin, iodoacetamide, acidified aspirin and acidified ethanol in rats.
 xxxd3296xxx  is one component of bile acids
that may cause gastric lesion by the retrogressive influx from the duodenum to the stomach
(30), and it has been reported to induce gastric erosion by the consecutive administration
to rats (31). histamine develops gastric lesion
as a result of a marked vascular disturbance in
the gastric wall as well as an increase in acid
secretion (32). although single administration

of  xxxd3296xxx  or histamine to rats showed
only a little influence on the gastric mucosa,
marked lesions were observed after the administration of  xxxd3296xxx  in combination with
histamine.  xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine inhibited  xxxd3296xxx -histamine-induced
gastric
lesions in rats at doses that suppressed
histamine-stimulated acid secretion in pylorusligated rats.  xxxd2965xxx  and cetraxate also inhibited these lesions at doses that suppressed
basal acid secretion, although these compounds did not affect histamine-stimulated
secretion. it is, therefore, suggested that the
antisecretory effects of  xxxd2082xxx , cimetidine,
 xxxd2965xxx  and cetraxate are mainly responsible for their antiulcer activity in the
 xxxd3296xxx -histamine induced lesion model.
serotonin causes gastric lesions by platelet
aggregation, followed by fibrous thrombi
formation and vasoconstriction, followed by a
disturbance in the peripheral circulation (33),
without affecting gastric acid secretion (33,
34). lodoacetamide is a sulfhydryl (sh) blocking agent and is thought to cause gastric lesion
by a counteraction on the endogenous prostaglandins, resulting in the depression of the
mucosal defensive factors (35). therefore, the
formation of  xxxd3296xxx -serotoninand
iodoacetamide-induced lesions seemed to be
dependent on defensive factors rather than
gastric acid.  xxxd2082xxx  and other drugs inhibited these gastric lesions in doses suppressing
basal or histamine-stimulated acid secretion. it
is known that acid is likely to penetrate the injured gastric mucosa and to make the lesion
worse after the mucosal epithelium is damaged
by the ulcerogenic agents (36). the control of
acid secretion, therefore, should help to reduce mucosal lesions induced by taurocholateserotonin and iodoacetamide. it is reported
that the antisecretory effect of cimetidine is
shorter than that of  xxxd2082xxx  in dogs (3) and
humans (37, 38). this could account for the
observation that cimetidine did not show any
significant influence on iodoacetamide-induced
gastric lesions.
the mechanism by which aspirin induces
gastric damage is thought to be the inhibition

of prostaglandin biosynthesis (39) and the disruption of the gastric mucosal barrier followed
by back-diffusion of hydrogen ions, stasis in
the proximal gastric mucosal microcirculation,
and increased vascular permeability (40).
ethanol has been shown to produce gastric lesions with concomitant impairments in such
factors as mucus (41) and mucosal circulation
(42). it was reported that  xxxd2082xxx  and
cimetidine did not inhibit the gastric lesions
induced by such severe conditions as 600 mm
hcl and  xxxd102xxx  (43, 44). in the present study, aspirin and ethanol were administered to rats together with sufficient amounts
of exogenous acid (150 mm hcl) in order to
exclude the possibility that the antisecretory
activity may be responsible for the protective
effect of test drugs.  xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine
inhibited acidified aspirin- and acidified
 xxxd102xxx induced gastric lesions like  xxxd2965xxx  (25) and cetraxate (28), which have been
shown to possess cytoprotective activity. the
degree of inhibitory effects of  xxxd2082xxx  and
cimetidine on acidified  xxxd102xxx induced gastric
lesion were not so marked (approximately
50%) but significant. in these gastric lesions
induced by acidified aspirin and acidified ethanol, we used sprague-dawley rats instead of
wistar rats because the lesion formation in
sprague-dawley rats was more marked than
that in wistar rats (data not shown). this may
be due to the difference of acid secretion between these rats, that is, sprague-dawley rats
used in this study secreted gastric acid much
more than wistar rats, indicating that endogenous gastric acid plays a role in the
pathogenesis of even gastric lesions induced by
aspirin and ethanol in combination with exogenous acid. it is, therefore, possible that the
prevention by  xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine of
acidified aspirin- and acidified  xxxd102xxx induced
gastric lesions may be partly attributable to
their ability to suppress acid secretion. from
these results, in any case, mechanisms other
than suppression of acid secretion might be involved, at least in part, in the mucosal protection produced by  xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine.
therefore, in the next series of experiments,

the effect of  xxxd2082xxx  on the mucosal defensive factors was examined in rats.  xxxd2082xxx 
and cimetidine have been shown to inhibit the
decrease in gastric mucosal blood flow induced
by hemorrhagic shock in rats (45, 46) and to
promote the transfer of bicarbonate into the
gastric lumen in dogs with gastric pouch (47,
48). in the present study, farnotidine
and
cimetidine inhibited the decreases in gastric
mucosal blood flow induced by acidified ethanol and in mucosal contents of glycoproteins
(hexose and hexosamine) by water immersion
restraint stress. furthermore,
 xxxd2082xxx , not
cimetidine, increased the transgastric pd and
promoted the recovery of decreased pd induced by acidified ethanol in rats. therefore,
it is suggested that there are some differences
between the mucosal defensive mechanisms
strengthened
by  xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine.
our data also show that the inhibitory effects
of  xxxd2082xxx  and cimetidine on the acidified
 xxxd102xxx induced
gastric lesion were not influenced by prior administration of indomethacin, indicating that endogenous prostaglandins
are not involved in the mechanisms by which
these h2-antagonists protected the gastric mucosa against the injurious action of acidified
ethanol.
 xxxd2082xxx , cimetidine and  xxxd2965xxx  inhibited almost all types of the gastric lesions
used in the present study in rats at doses that
suppressed basal or histamine-stimulated
acid
secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. on the contrary, cetraxate inhibited acidified aspirin- and
acidified  xxxd102xxx induced
gastric lesions at
non-antisecretory
doses, indicating that cetraxate has a gastric cytoprotective activity similar to that of prostaglandins. thus, the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2082xxx , like cimetidine and
 xxxd2965xxx , on gastric lesions seemed to be
attributable
to both its antisecretory
and
cytoprotective
activities, and the inhibitory
effect on acid secretion may be predominantly
involved in the antiulcer effect of  xxxd2082xxx .
in summary,  xxxd2082xxx  has been shown to
inhibit the gastric lesion formations induced by
 xxxd3296xxx -histamine,
 xxxd3296xxx -serotonin, acidified aspirin, acidified ethanol and

iodoacetamide;
and it is superior
to cimetidine,  xxxd2965xxx 
and cetraxate
in rats. the
preventive
effect of  xxxd2082xxx 
is thought
to
be attributable
not only to the suppression
of
acid secretion,
but to the activation
of the
mucosal
defensive
factors
such as mucosal
blood flow, mucus glycoproteins
ate secretion.
moreover,
the

and bicarbonresults
of the

present study indicate that the mucosal protection by  xxxd2082xxx 
is not mediated through endogenous
prostaglandins,
but may be due to a
direct action on the gastric mucosa like the actions of cimetidine
and  xxxd2965xxx .
