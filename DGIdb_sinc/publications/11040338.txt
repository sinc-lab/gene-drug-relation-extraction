1. introduction
asthma is believed to be an inflammatory disease,
which is characterized by the accumulation and activation
of eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa of airways žbarnes,
1996; giembycz and lindsay, 1999.. eosinophils are involved in the development of airway hyper-responsiveness
through the release of their granule proteins and other
mediators. it is now well established that apoptosis or
programmed cell death of eosinophil is an important feature in the resolution of asthmatic inflammation žanderson, 1996; simon, 1998; simon et al., 1997.. unlike
necrosis, that losses cell membrane integrity and releases
the dying cell’s contents in an uncontrolled and possibly
harmful manner, apoptotic cell is phagocytosed intact
without release of its contents žwalsh, 1997; ohta and
yamashita, 1999.. recently, apoptotic eosinophils have

been characterized in asthmatic airways ždruilhe et al.,
1998; vignola et al., 1999.. the number of eosinophils in
the asthmatic lung is elevated and is inversely correlated
with the number of apoptotic eosinophils ždruilhe et al.,
1998; vignola et al., 1999..
glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory agents for
the treatment of allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma
ždemoly and chung, 1998; barnes et al., 1998.. glucocorticoids affect the numbers and activation of inflammatory
cells in the airways. these target cells include eosinophils,
macrophages, t-lymphocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells,
neutrophils, endothelial and epithelial cells žbarnes et al.,
1998.. inhaled glucocorticoids have been reported to reduce the numbers of circulating and tissue eosinophils in
asthma žbarnes et al., 1998.. the exact mechanisms of
how inhaled glucocorticoids achieve these are unknown.
the induction of eosinophil apoptosis may be one of the
anti-inflammatory mechanisms of glucocorticoids in asthma
or allergy. in patients with asthma, oral žprednisolone. and
inhaled glucocorticoids žbeclomethasone. in an open nonplacebo-controlled study reduced the number of eosinophils

biopsies were reduced and the apoptotic index was higher
than in untreated asthma patients ždruilhe et al., 1998..
dexamethasone and methylprednisolone at high žusually 1
mm or higher. concentrations have been reported to reduce
eosinophil survival or induce apoptosis in vitro žlamas et
al., 1991; wallen et al., 1991; adachi et al., 1996; meagher
et al., 1996.. these evidences suggest that glucocorticoids
may work via induction of eosinophil apoptosis. furthermore, there is evidence that topical glucocorticoids inhibit
eosinophil survival in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of  xxxg1180xxx  žhagan et al., 1998; stellato et al.,
1999.. however, it is not known whether the inhaled
glucocorticoids ži.e.,  xxxd2145xxx , budesonide,
and beclomethasone., which are currently used in the
treatment of asthma, directly enhance constitutive apoptosis of human eosinophils at clinically achievable drug
concentrations. in the present study, firstly, we investigated the effects of beclomethasone, budesonide, and fluticasone on human eosinophil apoptosis. for comparison,
dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and prednisone were included. secondly, the role of glucocorticoid
receptor in the effects of beclomethasone, budesonide, and
fluticasone was determined. thirdly, their abilities to reverse the anti-apoptotic effects of cytokines such as  xxxg1177xxx ,  xxxg1180xxx , granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor žgm-csf., and  xxxg2296xxx 
žtnf.-a , when used at concentrations producing maximal
or near maximal anti-apoptotic effect, were studied.

2.4. determination of dna fragmentation

2.1. eosinophil purification

oligonucleosomal dna fragmentation was analyzed by
agarose gel dna electrophoresis as previously described
žkankaanranta et al., 1999, 2000a.. eosinophils ž2 ml of
1 = 10 6rml in rpmi 1640. were cultured for indicated
time. the cell pellet ž350 = g, 7 min. was suspended in
0.5 ml of digestion buffer ž100 mm nacl, 10 mm tris–hcl
žph 8.0., 25 mm edta žph 8.0., 0.5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate žsds. and 0.2 mgrml proteinase k.. the samples
were incubated at 508c for 12 h. the solution was firstly
extracted with phenolrchloroformrisoamyl alcohol
ž25:24:1; v:v:v., buffered with tris–edta buffer žph
8.0.. following a further chloroformrisoamyl alcohol
ž24:1; v:v. extraction, dna was precipitated with 2.5 m
ammonium acetate and two volumes of ethanol at y208c
for at least 24 h. the dna precipitates were recovered by
centrifugation at 12 000 = g for 30 min. after drying,
dna was dissolved in te buffer ž10 mm tris–hcl, 5
mm edta, ph 8.0., mixed with orange g and loaded into
wells of 2.0% agarose gel containing 0.5 mgrml ethidium
bromide. electrophoresis was carried out in 40 mm tris-

eosinophils were isolated under sterile conditions using
a modification of the method of hansel et al. ž1989..
briefly, a buffy-coat preparation ž50 ml. from normal
individuals was collected into 10 ml of acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant and hydroxyethyl  xxxd2538xxx . white
blood cell pellet was laid onto  xxxd3253xxx  and centrifuged at
700 = g for 30 min at 208c. the mononuclear cell layer
was discarded and the phagocyte pellet was resuspended
and washed in hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  žhbss..
contaminating red blood cells were lysed by hypotonic
lysis. the remaining granulocytes were washed, counted
and resuspended in 300 ml of rpmi 1640 ž2% fetal calf
serum and 5 mm edta.. eosinophils were purified by
using immunomagnetic anti-cd16 antibody conjugated
beads. cells mixed with beads were incubated at 48c for
40 min before loading onto a separation column positioned
within a magnetic field and washed with 40 ml rpmi
1640. the eluted eosinophils were washed and counted

2.2. flow cytometry
eosinophil apoptosis was determined by  xxxd3027xxx  staining of dna fragmentation and flow cytometry
žfacscan, becton dickinson, san jose, ca. as previously
described žkankaanranta et al., 1999, 2000a.. briefly, the
cells were suspended in 200 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome
solution žpropidium iodide 25 mgrml in 0.1% sodium
citrate and 0.1% triton x-100., protected from light and
incubated overnight at 48c before flow cytometric analysis. the cells showing decreased relative dna content
were considered as apoptotic.
2.3. morphological analysis
eosinophils were spun onto cytospin slides ž1000 rpm,
7 min. and stained with may-grunwald–giemsa
after
¨
fixation in methanol. the cells showing the typical features
of eosinophil apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, nuclear
coalescence žshift from bilobed to monolobed nucleus. and
nuclear chromatin condensation were considered as apoptotic žkankaanranta et al., 2000a.. when the percentages
of apoptotic cells obtained by morphological analysis and
flow cytometric analysis of relative dna content were
compared, a significant correlation between the two methods was observed ž r s 0.968, p - 0.00001, n s 132..

order to investigate whether glucocorticoids reverse  xxxg1180xxx -induced eosinophil survival, the effects of dexamethasone and fluticasone were studied in the presence of

4. discussion
glucocorticoids exert their potent anti-inflammatory effect by modulating the function of multiple target cells
relevant in asthma. eosinophils are believed to be an
important target cell of glucocorticoid action žgiembycz
and lindsay, 1999.. glucocorticoids promote eosinophil
apoptosis in the absence of cytokines in vitro žmeagher et
al., 1996.. in the present study, we compared the commonly used inhaled glucocorticoids for their relative potency to induce eosinophil apoptosis in the absence of
added cytokines. beclomethasone, budesonide, dexamethasone, and fluticasone produced a 1.5- to 2.1-fold increase
in the number of apoptotic eosinophils in culture. fluticasone and budesonide were the most potent glucocorticoids
in promoting constitutive eosinophil apoptosis.
the ec 50 values found in the present study for the
enhancement of eosinophil apoptosis were 3.7, 5.0 and 51
nm for  xxxd2145xxx , budesonide, and beclomethasone, respectively. the maximal budesonide concentration in plasma ž cmax . has been reported in a range of
2.2–5.6 nm after inhalation of 1000 mg via  xxxd379xxx  w
žthorsson et al., 1994.. furthermore, after inhalation, the
tissue concentration of budesonide in lung was shown to
be an average 8-fold higher than its plasma concentration.
after inhalation of 1600 mg, the budesonide concentration
varied in the range of 2–10 nmolrkg in the lung tissue
žthorsson, 1995.. the cmax of fluticasone has been reported to vary from 0.18–0.74 nm after inhalation of
200–1000 mg via metered dose inhaler or dry powder
inhaler žmeibohm et al., 1998.. in another study the cmax
was in the range of 0.4–2 nm after repeated inhalation of
fluticasone ž1000 mg, b.i.d.. for 7 days žthorsson et al.,
1997.. however, fluticasone is highly lipophilic and has
significantly higher volume of distribution than budesonide. the important consequence of this is that only a
small fraction of the amount of the drug in the body is
found in plasma and that the plasma concentration of
fluticasone does not correlate with its effects žthorsson et
al., 1997; barnes et al., 1998.. in fact, the tissue drug
concentration has been reported to vary in the range of
approximately 20–44 nmolrkg in central airways after
inhalation of 1000 mg of fluticasone. more importantly,
these high fluticasone concentrations could be measured in
the lung even 15 h after the inhalation žhogger
and

rohdewald, 1998.. thus, the increase in the rate of
eosinophil apoptosis by budesonide and fluticasone is obtained at clinically achievable drug concentrations. this is
also supported by our recent study where the delayed rate
of apoptosis in peripheral blood eosinophils isolated from
patients with asthma seemed to be reversed by inhalation
therapy consisting mainly of budesonide and fluticasone
žkankaanranta et al., 2000b..
the steady state cmax of beclomethasone has been
reported to be 2.3 nm after inhalation of 400 mg b.i.d for 2
weeks žharrison et al., 1999.. approximately a 20-fold
difference between the reported cmax and the ec 50 value
of the present study was found. thus, beclomethasone may
not produce a significant increase in the apoptosis of
circulating eosinophils. however, it is difficult to estimate
if beclomethasone would induce a significant increase in
the rate of eosinophil apoptosis locally in the lung. in fact,
this is supported by the finding of woolley et al. ž1996.
that in an open non-placebo-controlled study, a 2-week
treatment by inhaled beclomethasone in nine patients žof
whom three also were treated with oral prednisolone.
reduced the numbers of eosinophils in the sputum concomitantly with the increase in apoptotic index.
our results are supported by the recent reports of
mullol et al. ž1997., hagan et al. ž1998., and stellato et al.
ž1999. showing a similar order of potency for the topical
glucocorticoids in inhibiting eosinophil survival in the
presence of a suboptimal concentration of  xxxg1180xxx  or when
cultured in the presence of epithelial cell conditioned
media. however, the mode of cell death žapoptosis or
necrosis. was not analyzed in the above mentioned studies.
our results extend the existing data by showing that
topical glucocorticoids decrease eosinophil survival by directly enhancing the constitutive eosinophil apoptosis as
evidenced by flow cytometric analysis, morphological criteria and fragmentation of dna.
the basic mechanism of glucocorticoid actions is that
they penetrate into the cell and bind to glucocorticoid
receptor molecules in the cytoplasm žbarnes et al., 1998;
demoly and chung, 1998; pedersen and o’byrne, 1997..
the glucocorticoid– xxxg1601xxx  complex acts
as a transcription factor, binding to specific dna sites in
the nucleus. the glucocorticoid– xxxg1601xxx 
complex may also directly interact with transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kb žnf-kb. and activator
protein žap.-1. by these mechanisms glucocorticoids inhibit the transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in asthma ždemoly and chung,
1998.. however, glucocorticoids may also work via mechanisms not involving the  xxxg1601xxx , i.e. interaction with cell-membrane receptors or direct physicochemical interaction with the plasma membrane žhogger
¨
and rohdewald, 1998.. eosinophils have been shown to
contain  xxxg1601xxx  žmcconnell and howarth,
1998.. glucocorticoids differ in their receptor affinity,
lipid solubility and other factors. the agents that have high

glucocorticoid-receptor affinity, e.g.  xxxd2145xxx 
žrelative receptor affinity 1800 when dexamethasones
100. and budesonide žrelative receptor affinity 935 when
dexamethasones 100. žhogger
and rohdewald, 1998.
¨
were more potent in increasing the rate of eosinophil
apoptosis than beclomethasone žrelative receptor affinity
76 when dexamethasone s 100. and dexamethasone.
mifepristone, an antagonist of the  xxxg1601xxx 
žagarwai, 1996., completely reversed the effects of budesonide and fluticasone on eosinophil apoptosis. this suggests that budesonide and fluticasone modulate eosinophil
apoptosis through  xxxg1601xxx . the ec 50 of
fluticasone increasing apoptosis was 3.7 nm, which is
comparable to the reported ec 50 value for binding of
glucocorticoid žfluticasone.-receptor complex to dna
ž0.72 nm.. but it is significantly higher than drug concentrations that inhibit 50% of ap-1 or  xxxg1559xxx  binding to
dna ž0.041 and 0.0089 nm, respectively. žadcock and
barnes, 1996.. this suggests that the increase in eosinophil
apoptosis by fluticasone may be not mediated by inhibiting
ap-1 or  xxxg1559xxx  binding to dna.
 xxxg1177xxx , -5 and gm-csf prolong eosinophil survival in vitro žtai et al., 1991; yamaguchi et al., 1991;
stern et al., 1992.. these in vitro observations are corroborated by an in vivo study where  xxxg1180xxx  was shown
to orchestrate the eosinophilia in human nasal polyps
through its ability to inhibit apoptosis žsimon et al., 1997..
glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone žlamas et al.,
1991; wallen et al., 1991. and some other glucocorticoids
žmullol et al., 1997; hagan et al., 1998; stellato et al.,
1999. have been reported to inhibit the  xxxg1180xxx  or
epithelial cell conditioned media–afforded survival of
eosinophils. this survival inhibition by glucocorticoids has
been reported to depend on the concentration of cytokines.
in the presence of high concentrations of cytokines, the
inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on eosinophil survival
were completely or almost completely abrogated žlamas et
al., 1991; wallen et al., 1991; hagan et al., 1998.. our
study extends the existing data by showing that topical
glucocorticoids do not reverse the inhibition of eosinophil
apoptosis induced by  xxxg1177xxx , -5 and gm-csf when
added at concentrations producing maximal anti-apoptotic
effect. furthermore, a prior incubation of the cells for 1 h
with fluticasone was insufficient to reverse interleukin-5induced survival. this suggests that at concentrations producing maximal anti-apoptotic effect, the signal transduction pathway of  xxxg1180xxx  žfor review, see giembycz
and lindsay, 1999. does not include steroid-sensitive elements and, probably, is also different from that activated at
lower cytokine concentrations.
 xxxg2296xxx  has recently been shown to prolong human
eosinophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis žtsukahara et
al., 1999.. this effect was proposed to be mediated, at
least in part, via activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase žtsukahara et al., 1999.. in some other cell
types the anti-apoptotic effects of  xxxg2296xxx  have been re-

x. zhang et al.r european journal of pharmacology 406 (2000) 325–332

ported to be mediated by activation of  xxxg1559xxx  via tnf-receptor-1 or -2 and tnf-receptor associated factor 2-mediated signaling žliu et al., 1996; wallach et al., 1997;
darney and aggarwal, 1997; natoli et al., 1998.. at the
present, it remains unknown which signaling mechanisms
are involved in the anti-apoptotic effects of  xxxg2296xxx  in
human eosinophils. however, the finding that dexamethasone and fluticasone reversed the survival-prolonging effect of  xxxg2296xxx , but not that of  xxxg1177xxx , -5 or gm-csf
indicates that the mechanisms by which  xxxg2296xxx  reduces
eosinophil apoptosis are different from those triggered by
 xxxg1177xxx , -5 and gm-csf.
there is debate at the moment whether induction of
eosinophil apoptosis in the lung tissue contributes to resolution of allergen-induced airway inflammation žerjefalt
¨
and persson, 2000.. it has been difficult to demonstrate
apoptotic eosinophils even in steroid-treated animal or
human airway tissue žerjefalt
¨ et al., 1998; erjefalt
¨ and
persson, 2000. and studies reporting the existence of apoptotic eosinophils in human airway tissue ždruilhe et al.,
1998; vignola et al., 1999. may suffer from methodological problems. thus, alternative eosinophil clearance pathways such as eosinophil cytolysis andror luminal entry
may exist žerjefalt
¨ and persson, 2000; persson et al.,
1999.. in contrast, the occurrence of apoptotic eosinophil
death in bronchial lumen has been detected without any
doubt žerjefalt
¨ and persson, 2000.. the luminal eosinophils
are not immunologically inactive, but are still capable of
undergoing, e.g. cytolysis and thus release of the cell
contents to the surrounding space žpersson et al., 1999..
the present study suggests that inhaled glucocorticoids
enhance human eosinophil apoptosis at clinically relevant
drug concentrations. there is also evidence from an uncontrolled human study to suggest that glucocorticoid žoral
and inhaled. treatment reduces the number of eosinophils
in sputum with a concomitant increase in eosinophil apoptotic index žwoolley et al., 1996.. these data suggest a
possibility that inhaled glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in
luminal eosinophils and thus prevent them from undergoing activation or cytolysis. whether the induction of apoptosis by inhaled glucocorticoids occurs in airway tissue or
lumen in vivo remains to be clarified.
in conclusion, the present results show that budesonide
and fluticasone enhance constitutive apoptosis and reverse
survival-prolonging action of  xxxg2296xxx  in human eosinophils
at clinically achievable drug concentrations. thus, these
data suggest that direct regulation of eosinophil apoptosis
is involved in the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of glucocorticoids in asthma therapy.
