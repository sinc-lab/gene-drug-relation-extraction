the pharmacokinetics and some pharmacodynamic properties of atropine,  xxxd2220xxx  and scopolamine
are reviewed. with the development of new analytical methods for drug determination, it is now possible to
measure relatively low concentrations of these drugs in biological fluids and, consequently, some new kinetic
data have been collected. following intravenous administration, a fast disappearance from the circulation is
observed and due to a high total clearance value their elimination phase half-lives vary from 1 to 4 h. all
these agents are nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonists, but their actions on various organ systems
with cholinergic innervation show considerable diversity. the cardiovascular effects are of short duration;
other peripheral muscarinic effects and cns effects can last up to 8 h or even longer. differing from atropine
and scopolamine,  xxxd2220xxx  as a quaternary amine penetrates the biological membranes (blood-cns,
placental barriers) slowly and incompletely, making it the drug of choice for elderly patients with coexisting
diseases and for obstetric use. similarly, its oral absorption is slow and erratic, and hence it cannot be used
as an oral premedicant. atropine, scopolamine and  xxxd2220xxx  have a definitely faster absorption rate,
when injected into the deltoid muscle compared with administration into the gluteal or vastus lateralis
muscles. there appear to be significant differences in the metabolism and renal excretion of these agents.
scopolamine is apparently excreted into the urine mainly as inactive metabolites, nearly half of the atropine
dose administered is recovered in the urine as the parent drug or as active metabolites and about 80% of
 xxxd2220xxx  is excreted as unchanged drug or active metabolites. however, despite the diversity in some
pharmacokinetic features, the differences in clinical effects are not very prominent in healthy patients.

key words: anticholinergic drugs: atropine,  xxxd2220xxx , scopolamine; pharmacodynamics;
pharmacokinetics.

the history of anticholinergic agents in premedication
of anaesthesia dates back to the late 1860's, the era of
chloroform and ether (1). throughout the years they
have been used extensively as a part of premedication
to reduce secretions and to protect against undesirable
vagal activity (2). today, with modern anaesthetic
agents, the need to administer these agents to lessen
excessive secretions has greatly diminished. the main
reasons for the use of anticholinergic drugs in anaesthetic practice are protection against vagal reflexes, to
counteract the muscarinic effects of anticholinesterases
in reversal of competitive neuromuscular block and to
dry up the oropharyngeal secretions in some special
situations, such as in otorhinolaryngological (orl)
surgery (3, 4).
according to a recent survey concerning the use of
anticholinergic as premedication in finland, 48% of
anaesthesiologists gave anticholinergic drugs routinely
in general surgery, whereas 69% reported having used

them 5 years ago. half of the anaesthesiologists gave
the drug intravenously before the induction of anaesthesia, and the most popular agent used was  xxxd2220xxx  (70%). the most frequent indications for the
use of anticholinergic drugs were operations on the
airways, bradyarrhythmias, paediatric surgery and in
situations with excessive use of suxamethonium (5).
in a previous survey of mirakhur et al. about 10
years earlier ( 6 ) , atropine and scopolamine were the
two most commonly used anticholinergics, and the
majority of anaesthesiologists used the intramuscular
route. the pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs are
well known, but the pharmacokinetic data have been
gathered only during recent years because the determination of low drug concentrations in body fluids demands highly advanced analytic techniques.
in this paper we will concentrate mainly on kinetic
data of clinical importance, because the pharmacodynamic features of these agents have been reviewed pre-

viously (3, 7, 8). the values are expressed as mean f
s.d., if not indicated otherwise.
basic pharmacology of
anticholinergic drugs
atropine (dl-hyoscyamine) is an organic ester consisting of aromatic tropic acid and a complex organic
base tropine. scopolamine (l-hyoscine) differs from
atropine only by the addition of an oxygen bridge,
which converts tropine into a base-known scopine (9).
the molecules of atropine and scopolamine have an
asymmetric carbon atom and are hence stereoisomeric
(7). the commercially available atropine is racemized
during extraction and consists of a mixture of equal
parts of d- and  xxxd2306xxx  of which only the 1enantiomer is pharmacologically active. scopolamine
is 1( -)-hyoscine and is much more active than
d ( + )-hyoscine.  xxxd2220xxx  bromide is a synthetic anticholinergic agent with a quaternary ammonium structure (9).

the mechanism of action
the mechanism of action of anticholinergic drugs is
the competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at the
muscarinic receptors (9, 10) and, hence, these drugs
are also known as antimuscarinic or muscarinic antagonists. the action of anticholinergic drugs on the muscarinic receptors is highly specific and in general they
have no effects on the nicotinic binding site (9). recently it has been found that muscarinic receptors
regulate a broad range of physiological and biochemical activities throughout the central and autonomic
nervous systems via the activation of guanidine nucleotide binding (g)proteins. g-proteins in turn transduce
the extracellular stimulation into intracellular biochemical activity in a variety of systems. these biochemical effects include modulation of intracellular
second messenger systems (such as  xxxg67xxx  and
phospholipase c) and alteration in the flow of ions,
such as calcium and potassium across the cell membrane. the signal transduction at muscarinic receptors
thus involves at least three steps: agonist recognition,
receptor activation of coupled g-proteins and g-protein stimulation or inhibition of intracellular effector
mechanisms ( 1 1, 12).
there is now strong evidence that muscarinic
cholinergic receptors do not represent a homogeneous
group (13), but instead are composed of several subpopulations. the subtypes of muscarinic receptors can
be defined according to their amino acid sequence,
their mechanism of action and their pharmacology
(14).
molecular cloning studies have identified a family

of five distinct human muscarinic receptor (ml-m5)
proteins. each subtype is encoded by a unique gene
and the exact amino acid sequence of each receptor
has been described recently (11, 15). based on pharmacological studies with selective antagonists (mostly
experimental drugs, such as  xxxd2965xxx , afdx- 1 16,
methocramine) at least three subtypes of muscarinic
receptors denoted m i , m, and m,, can be defined (14,
15). the exact physiological function of these receptor
subtypes is still poorly defined, but the anatomical
location of the subtypes suggests that the neuronal
tissues have a preponderance of mi-receptors, whereas
the subtype m, is situated predominantly in the heart
and m3 is the glandular type (1 1, 15).
atropine, scopolamine and  xxxd2220xxx  are all
nonselective muscarinic antagonists, although atropine
has a small (2.1-fold) preferential selectivity to muscarinic receptors (m,) extracted from bovine cerebral
cortex (16). the sensitivity of the receptor subtypes
seems to vary in such a way that the inhibition of
salivation (m,-receptors) can be produced with low
doses (and low plasma concentrations, consequently),
whereas much higher doses are needed for heart effects
(m,-subtypes) (8, 17). as a result of the mechanism
of action described above, the measured plasma levels
of anticholinergic drugs do not necessarily correlate
well with the pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs
(18, 19).

effects of anticholinergic drugs
the effects of various anticholinergic drugs on heart
rate are complex. small doses of atropine give rise to
a slowing of heart rate, whereas higher doses produce
tachycardia dose dependently (20). the critical dose
associated with the cholinomimetic (bradycardic) effect of atropine is less than 1 pg/kg b.w. (16). such a
biphasic dose-response curve is even more prominent
with scopolamine, doses up to 2.8 pg/kg b.w. i.v. produce only bradycardia, with increasing doses no increase in heart rate is observed, and only after doses
of more than 8.4 pg/kg b.w. is a transient tachycardia
observed, followed by a long-lasting bradycardia (21) .
 xxxd2220xxx , in contrast, is almost lacking cholinomimetic effects at low doses (22); at higher doses, when
equi-effective doses of atropine and  xxxd2220xxx  are
used, there are only minor differences between the two
agents in their effects on heart rate (23). recently it
has been suggested that atropine-induced bradycardia
results from the m,-blockade of sympathetic ganglia,
and low concentrations of anticholinergics may cause
an increase in acetylcholine, perhaps due to a presynaptic effect on nerve endings (16, 24). all these drugs
give rise to a profound inhibition of salivation and
secretions of the gastrointestinal tract. they decrease

kinetics of anticholinergic drugs

the tone of the smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal
and urinary tract, leading to decreased motility (7, 8).
a summary of the effects of anticholinergic drugs on
various organ systems is shown in table 1.
drug determination
several methods have been used to measure anticholinergic drugs in humans (25). concerning atropine, a
few radioimmunoassays (ria) with sufficient sensitivity for clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been
published (26-28). the method of wurzburger et al.
(26) appears to be stereoselective, so that the pharmacologically inactive d-hyoscyamine is the principal enantiomer measured, whereas the methods of berghem
et al. (27) and virtanen et al. (28) measure both
enantiomers equally well.
a quantitative capillary column gas chromatographic method, which is based on thermal dequaternization of  xxxd2220xxx  has been introduced by
murray et al. (29), but no detailed kinetic studies
have been published with the method. the data of
 xxxd2220xxx  kinetics are based almost exclusively
on information obtained with the radioreceptor assay
(rra). the detection limit of  xxxd2220xxx  by the
rra is 70 ng/l in plasma, 140 ng/l in cerebrospinal
fluid and 2 pg/l in urine (30). the pharmacokinetic
properties of scopolamine have been studied only in
recent years. the limited amount of data is based
mainly on an enzyme immunoassay (sensitivity 20 ng/
1) developed for the kinetic studies of 1-scopolamine
(31) and on a sensitive and reproducible rra for
scopolamine (32). although the chemical analytical
methods are highly selective and specific, they yield
no information about the biologic activity of a drug
or its optical isomers (33). radioreceptor assays
(rra) can be applied to the bioanalysis of all anticholinergic drugs normally used in clinical practice

(30, 34-36). the rra provides a measure for known
biological activity, which can be related to the pharmacological effect. the principle of the rra is based
on the competition between drug and a radiolabelled
ligand for binding to a certain receptor. when a competitive drug is added to the mixture containing fixed
amounts of receptors and a radiolabelled ligand, the
drug will displace a certain amount of the labelled
ligand, depending on its concentration and on the
dissociation constant (33, 37). the actual concentration of the drug can be calculated from the logitlog transformation standard lines. the rra monitors
the drug reacting with the cholinergic receptors in vitro
at the muscarinic binding sites and, therefore, only the
biologically active components of an anticholinergic
agent will be measured. thus, the concentrations
measured with the rra are more likely to correlate
with the pharmacological effects compared with many
purely chemical methods, which may measure also
the biologically inactive enantiomers of drugs. o n the
other hand, the rra has its limitations; it measures
all drugs and their components that are capable of
binding to muscarinic receptors. consequently, it cannot discriminate between the parent drug and the
possible active metabolites, and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can interfere with the assay (36).
ria measures both enantiomers of atropine, the
active  xxxd2306xxx  and the inactive d-hyoscyamine.
in healthy volunteers the best correlation has been
found between the rra determined concentrations
( xxxd2306xxx ) and the various clinical effects of atropine. i n addition, the tissue uptake (receptor binding)
of the active  xxxd2306xxx  appeared to be more intense at lower plasma levels in comparison with the
inactive enantiomer (38).

absorption, distribution and
elimination
although anticholinergic drugs have been used in clinical anaesthetic practice for many decades, their detailed pharmacokinetic properties in man have been
evaluated only during the last few years.

heart rate

oral administration
the tertiary amines, atropine and scopolamine, are
absorbed relatively well from the gastro-intestinal
tract. an oral dose of atropine is rapidly absorbed
from the mucosal surfaces and from the intestine, but
not from the stomach (9, 39). in the study of brion et
al. the maximal effect on heart rate was observed at 1
h and the maximal reduction of salivary secretion at
3 h after an oral dose of 1 mg (40). the ratio of oral

636

t. ali-melkkila et al.

to i.m. doses of atropine on heart rate and salivary
secretion is approximately 2: 1 (3).
although seldom used in anaesthesiology, scopolamine is presently available as ingested capsules and
transdermal patches for the prevention and treatment
of  xxxd1892xxx . following oropharyngeal absorption scopolamine appears to have a significant systemic
absorption with a mean time to maximum plasma
concentration of 53 f 8 min (41). in a recently published study of golding et al. there was no difference
in the speed of absorption between the commercially
available ingested capsules and buccal tablets in
healthy volunteers: t,,, was 50 rnin and the halflife was approximately 170 rnin (42). the individual
variation was significant. it was suggested that buccal
or ingested scopolamine tablets administered simultaneously with the application of a transdermal scopolamine patch would give  xxxd1892xxx  protection
after 1 h (or less) up to 3 h. as anticipated from the
previous studies, oral scopolamine was associated with
a reduction of heart rate and the most frequent side
effect was dry mouth (42).
the gastrointestinal absorption of the quaternary
amines, like  xxxd2220xxx , appears to be slow and
erratic ( 17). however, the low plasma levels were associated with a distinct and long-lasting antisialogogue
action (maximum effect 6 h after drug ingestion). a
recent clinical study in infants demonstrated that oral
premedication with  xxxd2220xxx  (0.05 mg/kg b.w.)
did not provide protection against bradycardia during
induction of halothane anaesthesia, whereas oral atropine 0.02 mg/kg b.w. was effective in preventing bradycardic events during induction of anaesthesia. both
drugs had an antisialogogue effect (43). thus, it appears that the use of oral  xxxd2220xxx  as premedication is more likely to cause more unpleasant postoperative side-effects, such as dry mouth or urinary
retention, than useful preoperative and peroperative
drug actions.

intramuscular administration
atropine is effectively absorbed from the muscle, and
the peak plasma concentrations are comparable with
those obtained 30-60 min after intravenous administration (44). typically there appears to be a great
variability in the t, (time to maximum plasma concentration) and c,
(maximum plasma concentration) values after intramuscular administration
(table 2). also the site of injection has a significant
effect on the speed of absorption: in studies of kentala
et al. (38, 44) the absorption of atropine from the
deltoid muscle was found to be more rapid (healthy
volunteers and elderly patients, t,,, 9-13 min), when
compared with former reports, where the vastus lat-

eralis or gluteal muscles were used as injection sites
(45-48). an interesting finding in the studies of kentala et al. was that the plasma concentrations of racemic
atropine (dl-hyoscyamine) were three times higher
than those of  xxxd2306xxx , and they did not decrease
until 2 h after drug administration, which indicates a
significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of the
two enantiomers (the active 1-form and the inactive dform) of atropine (38, 44).
like atropine, scopolamine is also absorbed rapidly
from the deltoid muscle. a recent study in patients
undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting demonstrated that the time to maximum plasma concentration (t,,,) after 6 pg/kg b.w. of scopolamine into
the deltoid muscle was 13 f 7.9 min (table 2) and in
an earlier study with caesarean section patients (dose
10 pg/kg b.w.) the corresponding value was 10 min
(49, 50).
scopolamine differs from atropine and  xxxd2220xxx  (36) in many ways: the doses normally used in
clinical practice produce bradycardia instead of tachycardia and central nervous system side-effects are frequently seen. following premedication with scopolamine, amnesia especially is a common clinical finding
(41). scopolamine in combination with morphine has
been widely used as premedication of anaesthesia for
cardiac surgery (51) . cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb)
is accompanied by many physiological alterations,
such as haemodilution and changes in blood flow that
may have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs.
as with many other drugs studied (52), the establishment of cpb was followed by a significant decrease in
the plasma levels of scopolamine, and the elimination
phase half-life after cpb was longer (2.4 h vs. 1 h)
than that found in parturients (49, 50, 53).
the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular  xxxd2220xxx  was investigated (rra) in nine patients
(asa 1-11, mean age 60.6k8.8 years) undergoing
vaginal hysterectomy under the combination of epidural and spinal anaesthesia ( 18). following the injection of the drug (8 pg/kg b.w.) into the deltoid muscle,
a rapid absorption was found with a mean peak plasma concentration of 15.8 & 10.8 ng/ml after 16.1 min;
the mean plasma elimination half-life was 75.4 f. 14.9
min. the highest plasma levels were associated with a
significant increase in heart rate of short duration
( 15-60 min), whereas the antisialogogue effect lasted
up to 8 h. there was a positive linear relationship
between the  xxxd2220xxx  plasma concentration and
the increase in heart rate, but the correlation between
the concentration and the antisialogogue effect was
poor. a similar fast absorption of atropine following
an intramuscular (38) administration into the deltoid
muscle has been found, whereas the injection into the

gluteal region (54) or into the vastus lateralis muscle
(50) causes delayed peak level (the maximum plasma
concentrations are gained in 1.o-1.5 h) . apparently,
the reason lies in a significantly greater blood flow in
the deltoid muscle, when compared with the gluteal
and vastus lateralis muscles (55). thus, if fast drug
action is desirable, as for military personnel who are
at risk of organophosphate poisoning, the injection of
anticholinergic drugs into the deltoid muscle can be
recommended, although the fastest absorption of atropine apart from i.v. injection has been determined
following endotracheal (56) or inhalational administration (47). in contrast to atropine, no detectable
levels of  xxxd2220xxx  in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid
could be found following intramuscular administration
indicating the lack of cns effects ( 18, 19).

intravenous administration
atropine has a short distribution half-life of approximately 1 min and there is a rapid decline in concentration within the first 8-10 min. it has been calculated
that the amount of atropine remaining in the circulation  xxxd1891xxx  min after i.v. injection corresponds to less
than 5% of the administered dose (27).the magnitude
of the apparent volume of distribution (v,) indicates
that atropine is widely distributed in the tissues, since
the estimated value over 1 l/kg exceeds the total body
water.
there are only a few studies concerning the pharmacokinetics of intravenous scopolamine. the results obtained from a study by putcha et al. in healthy volunteers indicate a relatively long elimination phase for
scopolamine (4.5 h; dose 5 pg/kg b.w., n = 4 ) compared
with that of  xxxd2220xxx  (57). in pregnant patients
there was no significant difference in the elimination
of atropine and scopolamine, as indicated by their halflives (2.6 h for atropine versus 1.9 for scopolamine)
(40, 54). in contrast to those who received an i.m.
injection (10 pg/kg b.w.) of scopolamine, the patients
after i.v. administration were only slightly sedated,
without amnesia, and the dryness of the mouth was
less intense (40).
in earlier studies kaltiala et al. (58) followed the
fate of 3(h)- xxxd2220xxx  in six patients with t-tube

drainage and murray et al. (29), with a gas-chromatographic method, studied the kinetics of a single i.v.
dose of (0.3 mg)  xxxd2220xxx . both groups found
a biexponential disappearance of the drug from the
circulation, but they were able to measure the drug
levels only up to 3 h. an important finding was that
in urine and bile over 80% of the radioactivity corresponded to unchanged  xxxd2220xxx  based on paper
chromatographic studies (58). thus, it appears that
 xxxd2220xxx  is not extensively metabolized in man.
the highest activity in plasma and urine was found in
the first samples (@3 h) indicating a short elimination
phase of  xxxd2220xxx . after 6 h the excretion of the
drug was insignificant (58). based on these findings it
was concluded that  xxxd2220xxx  had a short antisecretory action of approximately 2-3 h. as we will see
later, there appears to be considerable variation in the
duration of the effects on different organ systems.
table 3 shows some important pharmacokinetic
parameters of  xxxd2220xxx  measured with rra following i.v. injection (6 pg/kg b.w.) in elderly (mean
age 66 years, range 66-75) patients and in children
(dose 5 pg/kg b.w.). the drug was administered just
before the induction of anaesthesia. for comparison,
the respective values of atropine (rra) are presented
as well (mean age 47 years, range 27-71).
 xxxd2220xxx  is a water-soluble, quaternary amine
in contrast to atropine and scopolamine, which are
tertiary amines (3). therefore,  xxxd2220xxx  penetrates more slowly through biological membranes,
such as blood-brain and placental barriers, which is
reflected as a lower total apparent volume of distribution (table 3). unlike  xxxd2220xxx , l-hyoscyamine, the active component of atropine exhibits a second
distribution phase of 37.2 +_ 27.0 rnin ( l o ) , but the first
fast disappearance of both agents explains pharmacokinetically their rapid onset of clinical effects following
intravenous administration.  xxxd2220xxx  exerts its
peak effect on heart rate 1-2 rnin later than atropine
(6); the difference cannot be explained exclusively by
the pharmacokinetic properties of these two anticholinergic drugs (3, 59, 60). moreover, there is no linear
relationship between the plasma levels of  xxxd2220xxx  and the heart rate response during anaesthesia ( 17).

it has been reported recently in a pharmacokinetic
study that the i.v. dose of  xxxd2220xxx  in the prevention of the oculocardiac reflex during ophthalmic
surgery in general anaesthesia was considerably lower
than suggested earlier (60-62). the difference could
be explained by the timing of the drug administration:
when  xxxd2220xxx  (dose 4 pg/kg b.w.) was injected
after the induction of anaesthesia, on average 5 min
prior to the traction of the external eye muscles, a
significant fall in the heart rate was noted in only one
of the 20 cases (60). the corresponding plasma levels
of  xxxd2220xxx  were 1 1.8 7.7 ng/ml. the plasma
level of 3.1 f 1.6 ng/ml (dose 1 pg/kg b.w.) did not
seem to give sufficient protection against the oculocardiac reflex.
it appears that the sensitivity of various muscarinic
receptor subtypes (10, 63) varies in such way that the
cardioacceleration is seen only at high plasma levels,
whereas other peripheral antimuscarinic effects, such
as inhibition of salivation, are seen even at lower plasma levels; and consequently the heart effects are of
short duration, when compared with other peripheral
effects (18, 23).
anticholinergic drugs are often combined with neostigmine at the time of antagonism of the neuromuscular block. several studies have demonstrated that
 xxxd2220xxx  is superior to atropine in this indication
(8, 64, 65), because the faster onset of action of atropine results in initial tachycardia followed by a rapid
fall in heart rate due to the onset of action of neostigmine, and postoperative bradycardia is more common
because the duration of action of neostigmine is longer
(66, 67).  xxxd2220xxx  and neostigmine are both
quaternary ammonium drugs, which have a parallel
profile of pharmacodynamic actions; their onset of
peak effects on heart rate is similar and so is the duration of action. consequently, numerous studies have
demonstrated that the mixture of  xxxd2220xxx  with
neostigmine given at the time of reversal leads to a
more stable cardiovascular system with less initial
tachycardia, fewer cardiac dysrhythmias and better

control of neostigmine-induced bradycardia (66-7 1) .
the data concerning the kinetics of antimuscarinic
drugs in children are scarce, and in neonates and
infants we have no data available at the moment. it has
been shown that atropine has a prolonged elimination
phase half-life (til2p)in children under 2 years due to
the increased volume of distribution (72), whereas in
children over 4 years no age or gender dependency in
the pharmacokinetics of atropine was found (73).
when the kinetics of  xxxd2220xxx  in children is compared with data obtained in studies on the elderly, it
appears that the t,12pis 2.5 times shorter in children
(mean age 1.1 +0.4years, weight 10.2k 1.7 kg), which
is due to the higher clearance ( 17, 74).
recently, it has been shown that the elimination
phase half-life of intravenous  xxxd2220xxx  is approximately 2.5 times longer in uraemic patients, when
compared with healthy control patients. the prolonged elimination of  xxxd2220xxx  in uraemic patients was most apparent later than 6 h after drug
administration (75). thus, because the elimination of
 xxxd2220xxx  in uraemia is severely impaired, repeated or high doses of  xxxd2220xxx  should be
avoided, because they probably produce prolonged
drug effects in these patients.

placental transfer of anticholinergic drugs
in late pregnancy the placental transfer of atropine
(54, 76) and scopolamine (53) is rapid. following i.v.
injection given just before the induction of anaesthesia,
clinically significant amounts of atropine can be detected in the umbilical circulation after a latency
period of 2-3 min (54). atropine and scopolamine
have a significant placental transfer (uv/mv ratios
near unity), whereas that of  xxxd2220xxx  appears to
be clinically negligible (uv/mv ratio = 0.22 0.16).
table 4 shows the concentrations of various anticholinergic drugs in a foeto-maternal unit. again, the intramuscular absorption in parturients following deltoid
muscle injection was very rapid (scopolamine t,,, =
10 min,  xxxd2220xxx  fa,=
10 min), but despite the

fast disappearance from the circulation, both scopolamine (53) and  xxxd2220xxx  (19) had a long-lasting
maternal antisialogogue effect.
it has been shown (76-78) that  xxxd2220xxx  (4.4
pg/kg b.w.) given i.v. in a parturient had no effect on
foetal heart rate or heart rate variability, whereas an
increase in the maternal heart rate was noted. similarly, the i.m. administration of  xxxd2220xxx  was
associated with an increase in maternal heart rate in
patients undergoing elective caesarean section. the
levels of  xxxd2220xxx  in the foeto-placental unit were
low when compared with the respective maternal plasma levels (19). thus, from the pharmacokinetic and
-dynamic point of view,  xxxd2220xxx  appears to be
the best choice when the use of anticholinergic drugs
is indicated in obstetrics.

renal excretion of anticholinergic drugs
the various chemical analytical methods used have
resulted in a highly variable picture of the metabolism
and excretion of atropine (25). the data reviewed here
are based mainly on studies with rra. atropine and
especially  xxxd2220xxx  are excreted to a great extent
as unmetabolised parent agents and/or as pharmacologically active metabolites capable of binding to muscarinic receptors in vitro (19, 37, 44). i n spite of the
chemical similarity to atropine, only 2.6 1.1 yo of
scopolamine was excreted into the urine when measured with rra (76).
the amount of atropine (gas chromatographic-mass
spectrometric assay) excreted in the urine as unchanged drug was 57% of the dose, and 29% was
excreted as an inactive metabolite, tropine (79). our
results in healthy volunteers (38) were quite similar,
except that in the elderly patients after i.m. administration only 23.1 yoof the dose was excreted in a pharmacologically active form (44). kalser & mclain (80)

reported a value of 30% (tropine-labelled i4c-atropine, tra) and they found significant amounts of pglucuronide conjugates of atropine in the early urines
of the subjects. in some other studies by gosselin et
al. (tropic acid labelled i4c-atropine) and kentala et
al. (rra after p-glucuronidase and sulfatase incubation), no conjugates were found (81, 82). these results
indicate that hepatic and renal insufficiency should
have an important effect on the kinetics and probably
also on the response of atropine.
data concerning the metabolism and renal excretion
of scopolamine in man are limited. after p-glucuronidase and sulfatase incubation, the amount of scopolamine in the urines of the parturients increased from
3 to 22% of the drug dose (82), which suggests that
a significant metabolic pathway for scopolamine is
glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. similar results were
obtained in animal studies as well (65). thus, despite
the structural similarity with atropine the renal excretion of unchanged scopolamine differs significantly
from that of atropine.
the precise metabolic pathways of  xxxd2220xxx 
in humans are not known. animal studies indicate that
it is metabolised via hydroxylation of the cyclopentyl
ring and oxidation of the hydroxyl group in the mandelic acid residue (83). the derivatives of  xxxd2220xxx  obtained by de-esterification and 3-hydroxylation
of the aromatic ring do not interfere with the rra
(30). studies using radiolabelled 3h- xxxd2220xxx  in
humans indicate that 85% of the dose is excreted in
the urine within 48 h and 80% of the radioactivity
corresponds to the unchanged drug (58). thus, it appears that after i.v. doses  xxxd2220xxx  is not significantly metabolised in man and the amount of the
pharmacologically active compounds in the urine
measured with rra apparently represents unchanged
parent drug. hydrolysis with glusulase@ increased

640

t. ali-melkkilx et al.

 xxxd2220xxx  concentrations in the urine only 15%
within 3 h, indicating that glucuronide or sulfate conjugation reactions are of minor importance in the metabolism of  xxxd2220xxx  (82).

conclusions
the main pharmacological advantages of  xxxd2220xxx  over atropine and scopolamine are better cardiovascular stability and the lack of central nervous system side effects (7,8,59), due to the chemical structure
(quaternary amine), its penetration through biological
membranes is slower and apparently more incomplete
than that of atropine and scopolamine; a fact that is
reflected as an almost negligible gastrointestinal absorption, unmeasurable drug levels in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid and low placental transfer (17-19).
o n the other hand, if profound sedative, amnesic
and antiemetic actions are wanted, scopolamine still
has its place, and the rapid onset of action of atropine
makes it invaluable in emergency situations (1-4). in
most instances, however,  xxxd2220xxx  is probably
the best choice among anticholinergic drugs available
today. i n the future, the development of selective antagonists for subtypes of muscarinic receptors will
hopefully enable us to achieve specific anticholinergic
actions without side effects from other organ systems.
in conclusion, from the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic point of view, the differences between atropine, scopolamine and  xxxd2220xxx  are
not very prominent and, in a healthy patient, the drug
known best should be chosen.
