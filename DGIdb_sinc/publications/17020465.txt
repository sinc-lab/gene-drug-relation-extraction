abstract
 xxxg231xxx  (ndi) is an inherited disorder characterized by renal resistance to the antidiuretic effect of  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), resulting in polyuria, polydipsia, and hypoosmolar urine. in the
vast majority of cases, ndi is associated with germ-line mutations in the vasopressin receptor type 2 gene
( xxxg231xxx ) and in about 8% of the cases with the water channel aquaporin-2 gene (aqp-2) mutations. to date,
approximately 277 families with 185 germ-line mutations in the  xxxg231xxx  gene have been described worldwide.
in the present study, the  xxxg231xxx  gene was genotyped in eight unrelated brazilian kindred with ndi. in five
of these ndi families, novel mutations were noted (s54r, i130l, s187r, 219delt, and r230p), whereas three
seemingly unrelated probands were found to harbor previously described  xxxg231xxx  gene mutations (r106c,
r137h, r337x). additionally a novel polymorphism (v281v) was detected. in conclusion, although ndi is a
rare disease, the findings of mutations scattered over the entire coding region of the  xxxg231xxx  gene are a valuable model to determine structure function relationship in g-protein-coupled receptor related diseases. furthermore, our data indicate that in brazil the spectrum of  xxxg231xxx  gene mutations is “family specific.”

introduction

n

ephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ndi) (mim #304800)
is a rare hereditary disorder that is characterized phenotypically by neonatal onset of polyuria, polydipsia, and finding of hypoosmolar urine in this clinical context is virtually
pathognomonic (van lieburg et al. 1999; morello and bichet
2001). in approximately 90% of the cases, ndi is caused by
mutations in the gene that encodes for  xxxd3495xxx 
type 2 receptor ( xxxg231xxx ) (birnbaumer et al. 1992), and the
mode of inheritance follows an x-chromosome-linked pattern, with variable expression in female carriers. in a minority of cases, germ-line mutations in the gene that encodes for
aquaporin-2 water channel (aqp-2) can be detected (van
lieburg et al. 1994) with either an autosomal recessive (mim
#222000) or autosomal dominant (mim #125800) mode of
inheritance (hochberg et al. 1997; mulders et al. 1998). the
coding sequence of the  xxxg231xxx  gene, located in region xq28,

has three exons that comprise 371 amino acids (birnbaumer
et al. 1992; seibold et al. 1992). the first exon encodes the
first nine amino acids of the amino terminus, the second exon
encodes transmembrane domains i–vi, and the third exon encodes transmembrane domain vii and the carboxy-terminal
domain. binding of the  xxxg231xxx  receptor by  xxxd3495xxx  activates adenylyl cyclase via gs, which, in turn, triggers the recruitment of aquaporin-2 water channels in the luminal plasma membrane to stimulate water reabsorption
(morello and bichet, 2001).
since cloning of the  xxxg231xxx  gene (birnbaumer et al. 1992),
277 families with 188 germ-line mutations (mostly missense
mutations) in the  xxxg231xxx  gene have been described worldwide
(table 1 and http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/nephros/).
in the majority of cases, there are private mutations and there
are few recurring mutations, probably representing mutational
hot spots. in the present study, the  xxxg231xxx  gene was genotyped
in eight unrelated brazilian kindred with ndi. five novel and

three recurrent mutations and one new polymorphism were
demonstrated.

materials and methods
all patients who lived in the southern (one family), southeastern (six families), and northeastern (one family) parts of
brazil, an area with approximately 143 million inhabitants, were
referred to hospital(s) because of polyuria, polydipsia, and failure to thrive. there were no reported consanguineous marriages
as shown in their pedigrees (fig. 1). the patients were subjected to clinical and laboratory investigation to establish the
diagnosis of ndi, according to established criteria (bichet
1991). when possible, their asymptomatic close relatives were
also subjected to diagnostic procedures to rule out nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus. this work was approved by each local ethics
committee.
genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood samples according to a standard protocol using the genomicprep
blood dna isolation kit (amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj) and following the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol. pcr for amplification of all coding exons as well
as adjacent intronic regions was performed using specific
primers as previously reported (friedman et al. 1994 and
table 2). because of its size, exon 2 was subdivided into four

overlapping fragments to enhance the ability to analyze this
exon. pcr reactions were performed in a final volume of 50
l containing 100 ng of template dna, 200 mol/l dntps,
10 pmol/l of each primer, and 1.25 u taq polymerase. thirtyfive cycles of amplification were done in a mastercycler gradient thermocycler (eppendorf, germany) with the appropriate parameters (table 2). after amplification, the single band
generated by the specific pcr reaction was excised from the
2% agarose gel. this dna fragment was purified with the
gfx pcr dna and gel band purification kit (amersham
pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. after this step, each pcr product was
sequenced, using the pcr amplification primers, in an abi
prism® 310 genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca). all products were sequenced in both forward and
reverse orientations. in the case of a mutation, a second dna
extraction was performed followed by pcr and direct sequencing.

results
molecular analyses by direct dna sequencing of the  xxxg231xxx 
gene demonstrated five previously unpublished  xxxg231xxx  mutations and one novel polymorphism (v281v,  xxxg889xxx   gtc), as
well as three previously described mutations (table 3). figure

in kindred #3, two brothers (iii:1 and iii:2) were affected
and their mother (ii:2) was a carrier (all genotyped). in this
same family, a cousin (iii:5) was clinically affected. however,
dna from this patient and his mother (ii:8) was unavailable
for genotyping. in kindred #7 there were two affected brothers
(iv:1 and iv:2) who were both genotyped. their mother (iii:2)
was genotyped and shown to be a heterozygous carrier. in addition, patient ii:5 (kindred #7) was clinically affected, but his
dna was unavailable. in kindreds #4, #5, and #8, dna from

the mothers was genotyped and showed a wild-type  xxxg231xxx  sequence.

discussion
in this study, five ndi families had their own “private” mutation (s54r, i130l, s187r, 219delt, r230p and v281v),
whereas three seemingly unrelated probands were found to
carry previously reported  xxxg231xxx  gene mutations. this indicates
that in brazil, like most studied populations worldwide, the

spectrum of  xxxg231xxx  mutations is “family specific” and that, to
define it, direct sequence analysis of this gene should be carried out in all clinically diagnosed ndi patients. furthermore,
the recurrent mutations described in this report have been previously found worldwide in ethnically diverse populations
(http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/nephros/) and hence in all likelihood do not represent a founder mutation. most of the mutations so far described are scattered throughout exon 2. in our
study, none were detected in exon 1, and only one mutation
was found in exon 3. because exon 2 is large, comprising 885
bp, it is a larger target. in addition, it is also interesting that
these mutations cluster in the area of the transmembrane domains. not only do all these mutations differ from each other
in position, they also seem to have a different effect on protein
function. although the pathogenic nature of the missense mutations was not directly tested in this study, predictions can be
made on the basis of putative effects of these alterations on protein function.

the s54r mutation present in two kindreds changed serine,
a small, neutral, hydrophilic amino acid, to a basic, positively
charged amino acid. the introduction of a charged residue in a
transmembrane domain may disrupt proper assembly of the receptor. the r106c mutation is located in the first extracellular
loop. this is a recurrent mutation at a cpg site that has been
previously shown in other populations (bichet et al. 1994; chen
et al. 2002; ulinski et al. 2004). this mutation exchanges arginine, a positively charged amino acid, to cysteine, a hydrophilic
(polar) amino acid. the presence of a sulfhydryl bond alters the
tertiary structure of the protein, leading to a significant dysfunction and accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine
monophosphate in response to avp hormone stimulation (chen
et al. 2002).
a missense mutation at position 749 (i130l) was detected
in 2 brothers from the same family. this codon is the site of a
different mutation previously reported (i130f). the effects of
this specific i130f mutation have been recently studied by

robben et al. (2005), who showed that the levels of endoplasmic reticulum (er) retention and maturation leads to some avp
binding and camp response. in the molecular alteration present in our patients (i130l), these amino acids are both nonpolar and similar in size, and hence are not expected to have a
major effect in the tertiary protein structure. interestingly, both
patients presented with mild symptoms of the disease, also indirectly indicative of some residual avp binding. it is also possible that the missense mutation detected is a rare polymorphism and that the pathogenic mutation is located in regions
not analyzed by this technique (e.g., promoter region), is a major gene rearrangement, or found in a different gene. however,
the fact that both brothers had only mild symptoms may be
taken as indirect evidence that a major gene rearrangement is
unlikely.
the previously described mutation (r137h) in the second
cytoplasmic loop results in an arginine to histidine amino acid
change. in this region resides a dry motif, which is highly
conserved, and the exchange of arginine for histidine causes the
inability of the receptor to couple to g proteins due to its constitutive association with -arrestin that is consistent with severe ndi (barak et al. 2001; oakley et al. 2001; wilbanks et
al. 2002). interestingly, it was recently reported that, if the arginine at codon 137 is changed to either cysteine or leucine, there
is a constitutive activation of the receptor, rather then an inac-

tivation, which is the predicted effect of ndi-associated mutations (feldman et al. 2005).
in proband #6, the 219delt mutation introduces a frameshift,
causing an introduction of a premature stop codon downstream
to the mutation site (codon 270), resulting in all likelihood in
a truncated protein and hence a clearly pathogenic mutation.
the missense mutation (r230p) leads to a nonconservative
amino acid change of arginine, a positively charged amino acid,
to proline, a nonpolar amino acid, a change compatible with a
drastic effect on the tertiary structure and function of the protein, but this remains speculative. the mutation in family #8 is
a c  t alteration that causes the exchange of an arginine to
a stop codon (r337x). this is a nonsense mutation (truncation), which rarely occurs in ndi in this gene, and probably results in a dramatic reduction in protein function. this mutation
is a type 2 mutation, whereby the receptor is retained in er
(morello et al. 2000) and has been found in diverse ethnical
groups (http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/nephros/). interestingly, this patient also presents the deletion of one c, located
four bases before exon 1; the effect of this alteration is unknown.
in conclusion, although ndi is a rare disease, the findings
of widespread mutations, either inactivating or activating, found
over the entire coding region of the  xxxg231xxx  gene are a valuable
model to determine the structure–function relationship in g-

protein-coupled receptor-related diseases. furthermore, genotyping patients and carriers is warranted to prevent all deleterious effects of dehydration as well as to help genetic counseling.
