background: obesity has become a global epidemic with recent estimates
of > 400 million obese adults. despite this, there are few safe and effective
pharmacological interventions for obesity. sibutramine is a weight loss
agent, for use as an adjuvant to a comprehensive program of calorie
restriction, exercise and behavioral therapy. objective: the goal of this
article is to review the available literature of pharmacological interventions
for obesity and specifically to ex amine data with sibutramine for the short
term on safety and efficacy for weight loss. methods: the literature on
sibutramine was reviewed after a pubmed and medline search in march 2008.
all randomized clinical trails were reviewed. results/conclusions: sibutramine
appears to be safe and effective in producing clinically significant weight
loss for up to 1 year. longer prospective clinical studies with sibutramine
are needed to evaluate its safety (effect on blood pressure) and ability to
maintain weight loss, improve metabolic profiles and reduce the risk of
cardiovascular diseases.

introduction

the world health organization has recognized obesity as a global epidemic,
and estimates that, in 2005, there were > 400 million obese adults, and over
1.6 billion and 20 million overweight adults and children under the age of
5 years, respectively. this figure is projected to almost double by the year
2015 [1]. in the us, in 2003 – 04, almost 32.2% of adults were found to be
obese (36.8% in the 40 – 59 years age group; 2.8% male and 6.9% female had
morbid obesity (body mass index [bmi] ≥ 40 kg/m2)) and 17.1% of children
and adolescents were overweight with a trend towards increasing prevalence [2].
being overweight and obese increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd)
independently or acting partly by means of its related co-morbidities such as
hypertension (htn), dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 dm).
a modest weight loss of between 5 and 10% of total body weight through
lifestyle modifications [3-5] or anti-obesity drugs [6-8] in the obese is associated
with improvements in cardiovascular risk and a reduction in incidence of type 2 dm.
although lifestyle modification is the cornerstone in the management of obesity,
it alone seems inefficient for the long-term maintenance of weight loss and
metabolic control [8,10], especially in obese diabetic patients [11]. a one-year study
showed that the combination of sibutramine and lifestyle modifications resulted
in more weight loss than either the sibutramine or the lifestyle modifications
alone [12]. the use of an anti-obesity drug is best recognized as an instrument to
help patients comply with lifestyle advice.

2. role of pharmacological interventions in
the treatment of obesity

national heart lung and blood institution (nhlbi)
guidelines recommend the pharmacological intervention in
the management of obesity only if dietary and lifestyle
interventions fail to produce a favorable outcome within a
considerable period of time in an individual who is obese or
overweight with related metabolic co-morbidities [13]. the
anti-obesity drug should always be used in conjunction with
behavior therapy, diet and physical activities. the objective
of obesity management is to maintain an adequate amount
of weight loss with the beneficial effects in cardio-metabolic
parameters ultimately to decrease the cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality [13]. therefore, the efficacy of such
intervention is evaluated not only based on weight loss, but
also on improvement in metabolic co-morbidities associated
with obesity [14].
safety issues, however, have led to the withdrawal of
several antiobesity agents – serotonergic drugs in 1997 (primary
pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart diseases) [15,16]
and some adrenergic drugs in 2000 (phenylpropanolamine
owing to hemorrhagic stroke) [17]. phentermine, an adrenergic
drug, is still the most frequently prescribed anti-obesity
agent [18]. the us food and drug administration (fda)
has approved its use for only the short-term, which limits its
utility in managing a chronic condition such as obesity.
sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate (meridia™,
 xxxd3201xxx ™) was approved in 1997 by fda for the longterm (up to 1 year) use as an adjuvant to a comprehensive
program of calorie restriction, exercise and behavioral therapy
for the induction and maintenance of weight loss. the
starting dose of sibutramine is normally 10 mg/day, which
can be increased up to 15 mg/day after 1 month. efficacy of
sibutramine is supported by evidence of a 2 kg weight loss
in 4 weeks of treatment, and beyond 3 months by a loss of
at least 5% of initial body weight from the start of drug
treatment. sibutramine therapy should be stopped if there
is inadequate response, as explained above. it is approved
for patients aged 18 years and older. sibutramine was
developed by knoll pharmaceuticals and is now marketed
by abbott laboratories.
orlistat (xenical™, hoffmann-la roche) is another drug
that was approved by the fda in 1999 for the long-term
(up to 2 years) management of obesity. the recommended
dose of orlistat is 360 mg daily in three divided doses by
prescription (xenical) and in a lower dose (180 mg daily in
three divided doses) over the counter (alli). orlistat acts in
the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit lipase
activity, especially  xxxg1789xxx , thereby reducing the
systemic absorption of dietary fat by ∼ 30%. it is approved
for patients aged 12 years and older.
rimonabant is a selective antagonist of the cannabinoid
type 1 receptor, and it is the first member of a new class of
compounds that targets the endocannabinoid system, which
2162

has been shown to be involved in the central and peripheral
regulation of food intake [19]. rimonabant is approved in
several countries in europe and latin america, and in canada,
but did not receive approval in the us. this article reviews
the published data addressing the long-term efficacy and
safety of sibutramine as an anti-obesity drug along with its
beneficial effects on cardio-metabolic profiles and safety issues.
3. pharmacokinetic profile and mechanism of
action of sibutramine

sibutramine, a tertiary amine, is rapidly absorbed following
oral ingestion and distributed extensively into tissues,
especially the liver and kidney. it undergoes considerable
first pass metabolism by hepatic cytochrome p450, isozyme
cyp3a4, to yield rapidly two pharmacologically active
secondary and primary amines (metabolites 1 and 2) through
demethylation, whose half-life ranges from 14 to 16 h with
peak plasma concentration within 3 – 4 h of oral ingestion.
these active metabolites are metabolized further by hydroxylation and conjugation to inactive forms (metabolites 5 and 6).
with repeated dosing, both active metabolites achieve steadystate plasma concentration in 72 h, which is twofold higher
than following the single dose [20]; however half-lifes remain
unchanged. the primary route of excretion for metabolites 1
and 2 is hepatic metabolism, and some are excreted into the
bile with intestinal reabsorption leading to secondary peak
plasma level in 6 – 10 h. the route of excretion for
metabolites 5 and 6 is renal (∼ 77% of the parent drug).
sibutramine exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers
arising from asymmetry within the molecule. it contains the
 xxxd2901xxx  substructure, which is common in older
anorectic drugs such as  xxxd163xxx , fenfluramine and
phenteramine. the two active metabolites of sibutramine
exhibit significant re-uptake inhibition activity for serotonin
(5ht) and noradrenaline (ne) [21-27].
sibutramine has a strong anorectic effect [28-30]. evidence
shows that both 5ht and ne re-uptake inhibition play a
role in anorectic effect of sibutramine [25]. the sibutramineinduced anorexia is either partially or completely inhibited
by pretreatment with  xxxg836xxx  blocker (metoprolol),  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  blocker
( xxxd3000xxx ) or 5ht non-selective blocker (metergoline),
5ht 2a/2c blocker (ritanserin) and 5ht 2b/2c blocker
(sb206553); but not by  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  blocker (ici 118,551),  xxxg831xxx  blocker
(rx 821002) or dopamine blocker ( xxxd3096xxx ) [24,29]. another
study showed that metergoline, ritanserin and 5ht 1b/1d
blocker (gr127935) do not alter sibutramine anorectic effect,
whereas sb206553 only slightly but significantly blocked
it [31]. amidst different findings, the approach to understanding feeding behaviors on a receptor basis will help to
develop more efficient drugs based on sibutramine as a
prototype in the future.
sibutramine has also been shown to increase energy
expenditure through thermogenesis owing to central activation
of the efferent sympathetic system in brown adipose tissue

sharma & henderson

(bat) [30,32-38]. one study showed that an increase in
sympathetic activation of bat resulted in preventing
tnf-alpha-induced atrophy of brown fat [39]. however,
resting metabolic rate was not found to be increased by
sibutramine compared with placebo, despite weight loss in
two studies [40,41]. a new finding suggests that sibutramine
has no effect on energy expenditure and thermogenesis [42].
interestingly, other studies found that sibutramine in fact
attenuates the fall in metabolic rate, usually accompanied by
weight loss [30,43]. published reports therefore provide
conflicting evidence on the effects of sibutramine on energy
expenditure, and there is no conclusive evidence that
sibutramine’s effects on energy expenditure contribute much
to its weight loss efficacy. finally, limited evidence in animal
models suggests that sibutramine produces distinct behavioral
changes such as resting and grooming rather than the
locomotor activity observed with  xxxd163xxx  [29,44].
3.1 clinical efficacy of sibutramine in weight loss
and maintenance

the pretreatment body weight seems to be an independent
predictor of the extent of weight loss and its maintenance by
sibutramine [45,46]. bray et al. [47] found that weight lost
with sibutramine at the fourth week of treatment was the
predictive of persistent weight loss in 24 weeks. when
sibutramine was given to obese subjects who had lost ≥ 6 kg
during the first 4 weeks of a weight loss program with very
low calorie diet (vlcd, 220 – 800 kcal/day), they not only
lost further weight but 75% of them also maintained 100%
of the weight lost during vlcd compared with only 45%
in the placebo group within a year [48]. the mean weight
loss in the sibutramine group was 5.2 ± 7.5 kg with 85% of
them losing ≥ 5% of baseline weight compared with the
placebo group, who gained 0.5 ± 5.7 kg, with only 55% of
them losing ≥ 5% of baseline weight in 1 year [48]. a more
aggressive approach to evaluate the efficacy of sibutramine
in maintaining weight loss achieved by vlcd was carried
out by mathus-vliegen [49]. out of 221 obese subjects,
189 subjects lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight (mean weight
loss 14.5 ± 3.2%) during a 3-month-long weight loss
program with vlcd, and were then randomized to receive
sibutramine (n = 94) or placebo (n = 95) plus conventional
diet and exercise for 18 months of a weight maintenance
program. at 6 months, 70% of the sibutramine group
had maintained 80% of the weight loss achieved through
vlcd. at 12 and 18 months, only 51 and 30%, respectively,
of the sibutramine group maintained that weight. in the
placebo group, only 48% maintained such a weight
in 6 months, followed by 31 and 20% in 12 and
18 months, respectively [49].
extreme calorie restriction (vlcd) shows rapid weight
loss, however moderate calorie restriction with exercise better
maintains the weight loss over the long term [50]. early et al. [51]
found that out of 148 obese subjects, 113 subjects lost
≥ 5% baseline weight (mean weight loss was 8.3 kg)

during 3-month-long comprehensive weight loss therapy
(sibutramine, 1200 – 1500 kcal/day diet and behavioral
modification), and they were then randomized to receive
sibutramine or placebo for the next 9 months. the sibutramine
group had an extra 2.5 kg weight loss, with 85.5% of them
maintaining ≥ 80% of weight loss achieved during
conventional weight loss therapy compared with those who
were switched to placebo (2.8 kg weight gain and only
36.7% maintaining ≥ 80% weight loss).
another study observed that subjects in a comprehensive
weight loss program with sibutramine for 6 months lost
7.5 kg of their baseline weight with a decrease in bmi and
waist circumference (wc) compared with the placebo group,
who lost only 3.6 kg in 6 months [52]. in a crossover design,
each treatment group was then switched to the other
treatment [53]. subjects who were on placebo for 6 months
and switched to sibutramine lost an extra 1.62 kg, along
with a decrease in bmi and wc over the next 6 months.
however, the extent of weight lost with sibutramine was
less than when on placebo only (1.62 versus 3.6 kg weight
loss) and also the weight lost in the sibutramine group
(1.62 versus 7.5 kg weight loss) before the crossover.
similarly, those on sibutramine for 6 months who were
then switched to placebo gained weight (3.2 kg), with
increase in wc and bmi in 6 months [53].
in the sibutramine trial of obesity reduction and
maintenance (storm) [54], a two-phase study to evaluate
the effect of continuous versus an intermittent sibutramine
therapy on weight loss, a total of 605 obese subjects
(age 17 – 65 years) entered into an initial comprehensive
weight loss therapy with sibutramine for 6 months. a total
of 106 subjects withdrew during this initial phase, of
which 3 cases were due to hypertension. out of the
remaining 499 subjects, 467 (94%) subjects who had lost
≥ 5% of baseline weight during 6 months were randomized
to sibutramine (n = 352) or placebo (n = 115) for an extra
18 months’ weight maintenance phase. during this phase,
148 (42%) subjects in the sibutramine group (11% because
of hypertension) and 58 (50%) subjects in the placebo
group dropped out from the study. eighty-nine (43%)
subjects out of 204 subjects on sibutramine maintained
the weight loss from the initial 6 months compared with
only 9 (16%) subjects receiving placebo by the end of the
24 months. the mean weight loss from the baseline was
10.2 ± 9.3 kg in the sibutramine group and 4.7 ± 7.2 kg
in the placebo group (p < 0.001). the greater mean decrease
in wc was observed in the sibutramine group compared
with the placebo group (p < 0.001).
these studies [51-53] suggest that proper dietary measures
and behavioral modification play an integral role in
weight loss and maintenance with sibutramine. likewise,
it seems evident that early sibutramine administration
may be beneficial in weight loss, more so than post-diet
administration and therapy. these studies [51-53] also suggest
that sibutramine should be given on a long-term basis for

3.2

clinical efficacy of sibutramine in metabolic control

sibutramine-induced weight loss and maintenance is
associated with an improvement in obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors. in obese non-diabetic subjects,
sibutramine for 24 weeks produced a significant weight loss
that corresponded to decrease in insulin resistance, along
with decrease in serum triglycerides and increase in highdensity lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) compared with
placebo [55]. although evidence is inconclusive, some studies
show that sibutramine may improve insulin resistance and
glycemic control independently of weight loss [56,57].
sibutramine may improve insulin resistance along with other
metabolic profiles only in diabetic subjects but not in healthy
subjects despite equal weight loss in both groups [58].
however, one study has found such improvements in both
diabetic and non-diabetic subjects [59].
sibutramine improves glycemic control further in those
diabetic subjects who are stable on a diet or antidiabetic
drugs [60]. finer et al. [61] showed that diabetic patients who
were stable on either diet (n = 9), or insulin (n = 10),
metformin (n = 13) or sulfonylurea (n = 25), all had further
improvement in glycemic control. sibutramine, along
with metformin (n = 98) [62] or sulfonylurea ((n = 53) [63],
(n = 24) [64]), showed improvements in glycemic control
and cardiovascular risk factors without side effects or drug
interactions. sibutramine also showed significant improvements
in glycemic control and lipid profile in diabetic subjects
((n = 30) [65], (n = 89) [66]) poorly controlled on diet or
antidiabetic drugs. similarly, sibutramine given in drug-naive
dyslipidemic subjects (n = 162) showed significant improvement in lipid profiles [67]. in the storm trial, treatment
with sibutramine for 24 months had produced a decrease in
serum triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
(vldl-c), insulin c-peptide and  xxxd3472xxx  and increase in
hdl-c [54]. these improvements in metabolic profiles
associated with sibutramine may be an indirect result of
weight loss.
3.3 sibutramine and its effect on blood pressure
and heart rate

sibutramine decreased weight without any significant
increase in blood pressure in hypertensive patients [68],
with or without any antihypertensive drugs [69]. a metaanalysis [70] acknowledged that sibutramine-induced weight
loss in obese hypertensive patients correlated with a reduction
in blood pressure (bp) along with other cardiovascular risk
factors. study suggests that increases in bp and hr caused
by sibutramine are not severe enough to warrant stopping
the drug [54]. hypothetically, sibutramine-induced weight
loss may indirectly decrease bp, thereby counterbalancing
the cardio-stimulatory effect of the drug. many other studies
have, however, observed an increase in bp and heart rate
2164

(hr) in sibutramine-treated subjects, which was cited as the
reason for a high attrition rate. in one study, subjects
co-treated with metoprolol and sibutramine (n = 28) had
low diastolic bp and hr compared with sibutramine alone
(n = 29), despite both groups having had equal weight loss
over 3 months [71]. interestingly, this study also found that
the sibutramine-only group had more than double the
attrition rate compared with the co-treated group [71].
another similarly designed study [72] showed a slight increase
in bp and hr in the sibutramine-beta blocker ± thiazide
co-treated group (n = 29) compared with the only
antihypertensive regimen group (n = 32). similarly, obese
hypertensive subjects (n = 150) treated for 52 weeks with
calcium channel blocker-sibutramine had a moderate increase
in diastolic bp and pulse (5.3% drop out due to htn
compared with only 1.4% in the placebo group) [73],
but not in the  xxxg36xxx -inhibitor
(ace-i)-sibutramine-treated group (n = 146) [74]. a study
of optimal treament of obesity-related hypertension (the
hypertension-obesity-sibutramine [hos] study) examined
obese hypertensive subjects on different antihypertensive regimens
plus sibutramine for 16 weeks found that the ace-i+
calcium channel blocker regimen was more advantageous
than others in weight loss and concomitant metabolic
improvements induced by sibutramine [75]. despite mixed
findings regarding the potential of sibutramine to raise bp
and hr, the safety of the drug in high-risk patients with
cardiovascular diseases is of a paramount importance.
3.4 efficacy and safety of sibutramine in
high-risk patients

in an open-label observational study, the efficacy and safety
of sibutramine were evaluated in 2225 overweight/obese
subjects with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (41.2%
had htn; 15.6% with dm; 45.5% had dyslipidemia; and
37% were smokers). in 3 months, 91% and 41% of subjects
lost ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% weight from baseline, which was
independent of the presence or absence of dyslipidemia.
however, dm and hypertensive patients lost less weight
comparatively, although bp and hr were decreased in all
patients [76]. meanwhile, sibutramine, when compared with
placebo in a primary care setting followed for 54 weeks,
showed more weight loss, which correlated with improvement
in serum triglycerides and hdl-c levels. hypertensive
patients on sibutramine had a decrease in bp, but hr was
slightly increased [77].
the long-term efficacy and safety of sibutramine in highrisk patients will be addressed by an ongoing multinational
sibutramine cardiovascular outcome (scout) trial, which
is scheduled to provide its final report in 2008. the scout
trial, in which subjects (n = 10,742) were randomized in a
double-blind fashion to receive sibutramine (10 – 15 mg/day)
or placebo along with lifestyle modification for 3 years, is
designed specifically to evaluate the potential benefits of
weight management on cardiovascular mortality/morbidity

in overweight and obese patients at high risk for cardiovascular
diseases (≥ 55 years of age with a bmi ≥ 27 kg/m2 or a
bmi ≥ 25 kg/m2 plus an increased wc; 97% with cvd,
84% with dm and 88% with htn). the 6-week singleblind lead-in period of the scout trial, during which all
patients received 10 mg sibutramine daily in addition to the
lifestyle modification, showed weight loss and decrease in
diastolic bp among hypertensive patients with a slight
increase in pulse [78].
3.5

sibutramine in adolescent population

sibutramine is approved only for patients aged 16 years
and above. however, a few clinical trials have shown that
sibutramine may be beneficial in the adolescent population
as well. sibutramine-treated adolescent subjects (n = 23) had
an average weight loss of 7.3 kg, with 8 cm decrease in wc
and 9.2% reduction in bmi from the baseline, compared
with 4.3 kg, 3.8 cm and 5.2%, respectively, in the placebo
group (n = 23) in a 6-month-long study [79]. another study
showed weight loss of 10.3 ± 6.6 kg and reduction in bmi
of 3.6 ± 2.5 kg/m2 from the baseline in sibutramine-treated
adolescents (n = 30) compared with the placebo-treated
group (n = 30), who had only 2.4 ± 2.5 kg weight loss
and 0.9 ± 0.9 kg/m2 reduction in bmi at 6 months.
seventy-three point three per cent of the sibutramine group
lost ≥ 5% body weight from the baseline compared with
only 10% in the placebo group, whereas 46.6 and 23.3%
of the sibutramine group lost ≥ 10 and ≥ 15% body
weight from the baseline, respectively, compared with none
in the placebo group. serum triglycerides and vldl-c were
significantly decreased in the sibutramine group [80]. adverse
events documented were those common to sibutramine,
such as headache, dry mouth and constipation, and no
participants in either study withdrew because of high bp
and hr [79,80]. in a 12-month study, berkowitz et al. [81]
observed 6.7 ± 0.53% weight loss and 9.4 ± 0.51%
(-2.9 ± 0.15 kg/m2) reduction in bmi from the baseline in
the sibutramine group (n = 368; 76% completed the study)
compared with 1.8 ± 0.94% weight gain and 1.2 ± 0.9%
(-0.3 ± 0.24 kg/m2) reduction in bmi in the placebo group
(n = 130; 62% completed the study). the sibutramine
group also had wc decreased by 8.2 ± 0.49 cm, triglycerides
decreased by 24 ± 3.27 mg/dl, hdl-c increased by
3.3 ± 0.44 mg/dl and an improvement in insulin sensitivity
(-12.5 ± 1.48 measured by homeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance) compared with the placebo group, with
-1.8 ± 0.86 cm, +1.2 ± 5.8 gm/dl, +0.3 ± 0.78 gm/dl and
-0.3 ± 2.66, respectively [81]. an analysis of the same data
set [82] found ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% reduction in bmi from the
baseline in 62.3% and 38.8% of subjects on sibutramine
compared with 18.1 and 5.5% only in the placebo.
tachycardia was observed in 13% on sibutramine and 6%
on placebo, but it was not the cause of withdrawal from the
study in both groups. the analysis showed that those having
≥ 5% reduction in bmi had less tachycardia and

hypertension. the incidences of adverse events were those
commonly reported with sibutramine, which were similar in
both groups [82].
3.6

dose-ranging studies of sibutramine

bray et al. [47] demonstrated sibutramine dose-related weight
loss and corresponding improvements in metabolic profiles.
within 24 weeks of treatment with sibutramine doses
ranging from 10, 15 and 30 mg/day, the weight losses
achieved were 6.1, 7.4 and 9.4%, respectively, of total body
weight [47]. loss of weight was observed to be occurring
even at 24 weeks with higher doses of sibutramine [83].
smith and goulder [84] found that subjects receiving
sibutramine 15 mg/day had 6.4 kg weight loss, with 57
and 34% of them having ≥ 5 and ≥ 10% weight loss,
respectively, from the baseline compared with 4.4 kg, 39
and 19%, respectively, in sibutramine 10 mg/day in
1 year [84]. however, hanotin et al. [85] observed equal
weight loss with 10 and 15 mg/day of sibutramine in a
12-week study. all these studies were performed on
uncomplicated obese subjects [47,84,85].
in overweight diabetic subjects, mcnulty et al. [62]
demonstrated that sibutramine 20 mg/day produced weight
loss of 8 ± 0.9 kg, with 27% of subjects experiencing ≥ 10%
weight loss from the baseline compared with sibutramine
15 mg/day, who had only 5.5 ± 0.6 kg weight loss, with
only 14% of them having ≥ 10% weight loss from the
baseline in 48 weeks. subjects with ≥ 10% weight loss
regardless of dose of sibutramine had better glycemic control
and decreased serum triglycerides levels. subjects receiving
sibutramine 20 mg/day had an increased serum hdl-c
level. those on sibutramine 15 mg/day had increased diastolic
bp (+5 mmhg) compared with placebo, but such was less
obvious in any subjects with ≥ 10% weight loss from
baseline [62]. in another study of elderly overweight subjects
with poorly controlled dm, the dose of sibutramine was
gradually increased to 20 mg/day within the initial 6 weeks
and maintained for 24 weeks [66]. at 24 weeks, the sibutramine
group lost only 4.3 kg (4.5% of baseline weight) weight,
with 33 and 8% of them having ≥ 5 and ≥ 10% weight
loss from the baseline compared with the placebo group,
which lost only 0.4 kg mean weight, and none of the
subjects in the placebo group achieved ≥ 5% weight loss.
those with higher weight loss in the sibutramine group had
better glycemic control (≥ 10% weight loss had glycosylated
hemoglobin [hba1c] decreased by 1.65% compared with
only 0.53% decreased in ≥ 5% weight loser [66]. another
study of the same duration in poorly controlled dyslipidemia
with the same dose of sibutramine (20 mg/day) showed similar
amounts of weight loss in sibutramine and placebo groups
(i.e., 4.3 and 0.4 kg, respectively). those with ≥ 10% weight
loss (12%) had better control of blood lipids than those
with ≥ 5% weight loss (42%) [67]. studies have shown that
an improvement in most domains of quality of life corresponds
with greater weight loss and better glycemic control [86].

sibutramine

this evidence suggests that the extent of weight loss,
regardless of the dose of sibutramine, actually correlates with
the better glycemic control and decrease in blood lipids
levels. it is therefore important to understand predictors of
response to sibutramine. the higher dose of sibutramine
clearly seems to produce more weight loss. however, the
optimal dose of sibutramine in high-risk patients with
cardiovascular diseases should be determined as this drug
has cardio-stimulatory side effects.
3.7 adverse effects and contraindications of
sibutramine

other than possible cardio-stimulatory effects leading
to htn and increased hr, sibutramine is associated
with milder side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache,
sweating, dry mouth, anorexia, constipation, insomnia and
palpitation [52,53,72,79,83,87]. some sporadic cases of panic
attack [88], impaired memory [89], mania in bipolar patients [90],
psychosis [91,92] and relapse of delusional disorder [93] have
been reported with sibutramine. similarly, cases with severe
bullous drug eruption [94], reversible hepatotoxicity [95],
qt-prolongation and dysrhythmias [96] associated with
sibutramine have been reported. however, sibutramine does
not cause valvular heart diseases [97,98] or impair ventricular
structure and function [98,99]. sibutramine does not have
 xxxd163xxx -like abuse liability [100,101] and is classified as a
schedule iv drug in the us. some limited evidence shows
that sibutramine is safe during pregnancy [102].
sibutramine is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine
oxidase inhibitors, other centrally acting anorexic drugs and
possibly selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [103]. it
should also not be given to patients with anorexia nervosa
and bulimia, serious depression and mania, and to those
with cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery diseases,
congestive cardiac failure, dysrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, stroke and transient ischemic
attacks. as it undergoes an extensive hepatic first pass
metabolism, sibutramine should not be given to patients
with severe hepatic failure. drugs inhibiting hepatic cytochrome p450, such as erythromycin and ketoconazole, may
increase the plasma level of sibutramine. sibutramine is
eliminated by kidneys, therefore it is also not advised for use
in severe kidney failure. vigilance is required when prescribing
sibutramine to patients with seizure disorders, hyperthyroidism,
pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, closed angle glaucoma
or pregnant and lactating women.

sibutramine in psychiatry

originally synthesized as a possible antidepressant, sibutramine
was not found to be superior to placebo in the treatment of
major depression. sibutramine is not approved for the
treatment of any psychiatric conditions and, despite its
anorectic effect, it is not approved for binge-eating disorder
and bulimia. in non-psychiatric obese and overweight
2166

patients, sibutramine has shown an improvement in mood
within 3 months of treatment compared with orlistat or
diet alone [104]. when sibutramine along with a behavioral
nutrition program was given to subjects with schizophrenia
taking olanzapine or clozapine, the two main atypical antipsychotic drugs associated with increases in weight and
metabolic problems, significant weight loss along with
improvement in glucose homeostasis was observed in those
on olanzapine [105] but not on clozapine [106] compared
with placebo. most importantly, these studies did not
observe the worsening of both positive and negative
symptoms of schizophrenia in 12 weeks [105,106]. likewise,
clinical trials with sibutramine in subjects with binge-eating
disorder have found the reduction in food intake and weight
along with improvement in co-morbid psychiatric condition,
especially depression [107,108].
5. comparison of efficacy and safety with
orlistat and rimonabant

orlistat has produced clinically meaningful weight loss
sufficient to improve blood pressure, dyslipidaemia and
hyperglycaemia compared with placebo in randomized clinical
trials lasting 1 – 2 years [6,19,109-116]. orlistat significantly
reduced the regain of lost weight during the 3-year
study [117]. the weight loss induced by orlistat reduced the
development of type 2 dm by 37% during another 4-year
study [118]. orlistat improves glucose homeostasis in both
obese non-diabetic and diabetic patients [119,120]. furthermore,
obese diabetic patients on antidiabetic drugs [109,121,122] or
who are drug-naive [123] and whose diabetes was either under
control [109] or not [121,122] all achieved a significantly greater
decrease in body weight with orlistat compared with placebo,
as well as significant improvements in hba1c, fasting glucose
levels and atherogenic lipid profiles. studies also showed a
decreased need or even cessation of antidiabetic drugs following
improvements in glycemic control [109,124]. a meta-analysis [125]
showed that orlistat improved cholesterol levels independently
of the weight loss. another meta-analysis [126] showed that
orlistat efficiently causes weight loss with improvements in
cardiometabolic profiles in subjects with definitive obesityrelated risk factors. wirth [127], in a post-marketing
surveillance study (n = 15,549; 4/5 having obesity-related
co-morbidities) for 7.1 months, found that orlistat decreased
weight by 10.7% below baseline, with 87 and 51% losing
≥ 5 and 10% weight from the baseline, respectively.
similarly, four rimonabant in obesity (rio) trials have
been published so far. an rio-diabetes trial [128,129] conducted
in 1047 subjects with dm either on metformin or sulfonyluria
showed marked weight loss, decreased wc, decreased hba1c
along with decreased metabolic syndrome (mets), systolic bp
and  xxxg520xxx  within 1 year of rimonabant treatment.
similarly, an rio-lipids trial [130] conducted in 1036 subjects
with untreated dyslipidemia found significant improvement in
atherogenic lipid profile along with weight loss within 1 year

of treatment with the drug. likewise, an rio-europe
trial [131] conducted in 1507 subjects with hypertension and
dyslipidemia had a decreased mean wc of 6.5 cm with
improvement in lipid profile and decrease in mets within
1 year of treatment with the drug. an rio-north america
trial [132] was conducted in 3045 subjects with or without
concurrent antihypertensive or antidyslipidemic drugs. the
study found that the rimonabant group had a marked loss
of weight, decreased wc and improvement in lipid profiles
compared with the placebo group in 1 year. those on
rimonabant were then rerandomized either to continue on
rimonabant or to be switched to placebo for another year.
likewise, those on placebo the first year continued on
placebo the following year. subjects who switched from
rimonabant to placebo gained weight, but those who
remained on rimonabant for the full 2 years kept losing
weight along with improvements in cardio-metabolic profiles [132].
a meta-analysis [133] has also validated that continuous
treatment with rimonabant for 2 years was superior to the
treatment for 1 year or 1 year followed by placebo. this
meta-analysis showed that rimonabant may induce an
average weight loss of 8.5 kg, decrease in wc by 8.24 cm
and bmi by 2.98 kg/m2, along with 9.28% and 7.15%
relative reduction in the 5-year incidence of dm and cvd
when treatment continued for 2 years [133].
ruilope et al. [134] studied these 4 rio trials with a focus
on blood pressure, as 37.2% of subjects in all 4 trials were
hypertensive and 71.4% were on different antihypertensive
drugs. the analysis showed that rimonabant decreased both
systolic and diastolic bp in 1 year. the analysis of a subset
with higher bp at baseline showed a more pronounced
decrease in bp, as were those with dm and dyslipidemia.
rimonabant seemed to preferably control bp in high-risk
subjects. kakafika et al. [135] also studied these four rio
trials and found that rimonabant effectively produced weight
loss, decreased wc and improved cardiometabolic risk factors.
there are very limited studies directly comparing efficacy
of sibutramine with orlistat and rimonabant for weight loss
and metabolic improvements. however, two meta-analyses [10,136]
found that patients taking sibutramine lost ∼ 4.4 kg more
weight and those taking orlistat lost ∼ 2.8 kg more weight
than placebo in 1 year. a meta-analysis [137] of 8 randomized
clinical trials with 885 subjects comparing weight loss by
sibutramine and orlistat with study period ranging over
3 – 12 months found 4 studies favoring sibutramine to lose
more weight than orlistat (mean difference was 2.2 kg),
3 studies showed equal efficacy in weight loss and 2 studies
showed sibutramine–orlistat co-therapy to be better than
orlistat monotherapy but not better than sibutramine
monotherapy for weight loss.
two meta-analyses [8,138] have shown that sibutramine
and rimonabant cause more weight loss (∼ 4 – 5 kg) than
orlistat (∼ 3 kg). sibutramine and riminobant may therefore
be more efficacious than orlistat for the weight loss. between
sibutramine and rimonabant, the latter drug may yield

slightly greater weight loss and also leads to improvements
in triglycerides, hdl-c and hba1c, whereas data for such
improvements are rather scarce for sibutramine. treatment
with orlistat, on the other hand, seems to be associated with
superior improvements in lipids, and orlistat has been
demonstrated to prevent type 2 dm.
despite its efficacy being well validated, the safety of
orlistat is of great concern. perrio et al. [139], in an
observational cohort study (n = 16,021) using a prescriptionevent monitoring system, found 30.3% (2.1% due to
diarrhea) of patients stopped taking orlistat within 3 months
of starting the treatment. over the duration of the study,
5.6% cited gastrointestinal (gi) events as a reason for stopping
orlistat. a few extremely rare events such as cutaneous
leukocytoclastic vasculitis [140], lichenoid eruption [141],
diabetic ketoacidosis [142] and serious hepatic adverse
reactions [143-145] have also been reported with the use of
orlistat. likewise, the fda has not approved rimonabant at
the present time because of a lack of adequate safety
data [146,147]. all rio-lipid trials [130,148] as well as the
recently published strategy to reduce atherosclerosis
development involving administration of rimonabant –
the intravascular ultrasound study (stradivarius)
trial [149] show an increased frequency of anxiety and
depression associated with riminobant. however, nausea is
the most frequent side effect of rimonabant [132,135].
most clinical trials have reported that gi upsets due to
orlistat were well tolerated and subside with continuous use.
however, with the modest weight loss caused by orlistat, the
gi side effects, which are usually bothersome, put its
tolerability and compliance in doubt as a long-term antiobesity drug. similarly, chronic fat deficiency caused by
orlistat may also be deleterious to the body homeostasis.
orlistat may also cause deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins
and decreases bioavailability of several drugs [150]. however,
sibutramine has cardiovascular side effects and contraindications, whereas orlistat and rimonabant do not have
such issues. cardiovascular diseases are clearly associated
with obesity. therefore, cardiovascular side effects of sibutramine
raise questions regarding its safety in the long-term treatment
of chronic disease such as obesity.

expert opinion

the efficacy of sibutramine for clinically significant weight
loss along with improvement in cardio-metabolic risk factors
has been adequately validated by several studies [37,84,85,151-154].
the management of obesity is a long-term process. longer
prospective and more methodologically rigorous studies
to evaluate weight loss and maintenance along with
improvements in cardio-metabolic profiles to decrease
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as possible
side effects are required to validate fully any potential longterm efficacy and safety of sibutramine. as very few studies
have been conducted in children and adolescents, the efficacy

for personal use only.

sibutramine

and safety of sibutramine should also be validated in this
population. the possible reason for the high attrition rate as
observed in most studies should be addressed before any
future studies.
as improvement in cardio-metabolic parameters is the
main objective of obesity treatment because obese patients
usually have several co-morbitities, especially dm, in which
case weight loss is hard to achieve, a more aggressive approach
of extreme calorie restriction, possibly higher dosing of
sibutramine, co-treatment with orlistat or rimonabant (if
approved by fda) or even concurrent treatment with
antidiabetic drugs, hypolipidemic drugs and antihypertensive
drugs may be taken into consideration in future researches
with sibutramine. indeed, safety concerns are of paramount
importance when conducting such researches.
the ne-induced cardio-stimulatory effect of sibutramine
may be counterbalanced by its weight loss potential. most
studies lasting up to 2 years show an increase in bp and hr
with sibutramine, but not severe enough to discontinue the
treatment. similarly, there is a great individual variation in
the rise of bp due to sibutramine. however, the data are
lacking as to what happens with bp on long-term sibutramine
treatment. nevertheless, the possible hypertension and
tachycardia associated with sibutramine may be addressed
by evaluating a suitable antihypertensive drug to be
co-administered with sibutramine in future research. limited
data suggest that short-term treatment with sibutramine is
not associated with valvular heart disease; it is critical to
understand whether sibutramine may cause any heart
problems when given for a longer period.
in a real clinical scenario, an anti-obesity drug is
recommended to those who already have multiple cardiovascular risk factors. a scout trial may clarify the safety
of sibutramine in treating high-risk patients; however, further
studies are acutely warranted. concerning, but rare, side
effects of sibutramine, such as dysarrhythmia and reversible
hepatotoxicity, reported sporadically, could be an idiosyncrasy
effect of the drug; however, these should also be taken
seriously in future studies. obesity and depression frequently
coexist; the successful weight loss can be achieved only if
depression is properly addressed [155,156]. however, concurrent
use of sibutramine with antidepressant drugs is contraindicated
owing to the risk of life-threatening serotonin syndrome.
future studies should focus on addressing this clinical dilemma.

2168

as anti-obesity drugs are an adjuvant to diet and exercise
for weight loss and maintenance, the cognitive and behavioral
therapy and lifestyle modification may enhance the effectiveness
of any anti-obesity drug. the management of obesity may
require patients to take anti-obesity drugs for life, just
like antidiabetic, hypolipidemic and antihypertensive drugs.
interestingly, the decrease need of the latter drugs following
weight loss and improvements in metabolic profiles in an
individual treated with sibutramine and other anti-obesity
drugs is encouraging with regard to the possibility of
anti-obesity drugs single-handedly treating obesity as well
as related co-morbidities. future research should examine
this possibility.
the knowledge on body weight homeostasis and appetite
regulation has expanded tremendously in recent years. possible
genes associated with obesity have also been identified. such
advancements have provided grounds for the development
of several new drugs against obesity in the future. however,
obesity is a global epidemic and despite several efforts to
address the issue for almost a quarter of a century, the
problem is growing. in conclusion, extensive research is
warranted at the moment to elucidate fully the efficacy
and safety of sibutramine in long-term weight maintenance
in a wider age group and people with obesity-related
co-morbidities, and its unique mechanism of action – the
understanding would be valuable in its wider applications as
well as its role as a prototype drug for invention of more
efficient anti-obesity drugs in the future.
