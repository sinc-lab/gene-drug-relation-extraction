summary
the salivary fluid secretory mechanism is thought to require na+/k+/2clcotransporter-mediated cl- uptake. to directly test this possibility we studied the in vivo and in
vitro functioning of acinar cells from the parotid glands of mice with targeted disruption of
 xxxg2079xxx , the gene encoding the salivary na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter. in wild-type mice  xxxg2079xxx 
was localized to the basolateral membranes of parotid acinar cells, while expression was not
detected in duct cells. the lack of functional  xxxg2079xxx  resulted in a dramatic reduction (>60 %) in

signal. consistent with defective cl- uptake, a loss of bumetanide-sensitive cl- influx was
observed in parotid acinar cells from mice lacking  xxxg2079xxx . cl-/hco3- exchanger activity was
increased in parotid acinar cells isolated from knockout mice suggesting that the residual saliva
secreted by mice lacking  xxxg2079xxx  is associated with anion exchanger-dependent cl- uptake.
indeed, expression of the cl-/hco3- exchanger ae2 was enhanced suggesting that this
transporter compensates for the loss of functional na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter. furthermore, the
ability of the parotid gland to conserve nacl was abolished in  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice. this
deficit was not associated with changes in the morphology of the ducts, but transcript levels for
the alpha, beta and gamma subunits of the epithelial na+ channel enac were reduced. these data directly
demonstrate that  xxxg2079xxx  is the major cl- uptake mechanism across the basolateral membrane of
acinar cells and is critical for driving saliva secretion in vivo.

introduction
saliva is initially secreted as an isotonic, plasma-like fluid, the production of which is
dependent on the concerted activity of a number of membrane transport proteins to drive
transepithelial cl- movement across acinar cells (see reviews: 1, 2). according to the current
model, na+/k+/2cl- cotransport and coupled na+/h+ and cl-/hco3- exchange utilize the
inwardly-directed na+ chemical gradient generated by the na+ pump to mediate cl- influx

of cl- above electrochemical equilibrium (3). stimulation via ca2+-mobilizing agonists triggers
secretion by enhancing the k+ and cl- permeability of the basolateral and apical membranes,
respectively, and thereby initiating luminal cl- accumulation (4, 5). these same agonists
dramatically upregulate acinar na+/k+/2cl- cotransport (6) and na+/h+ exchange activity (7,
8) consistent with the proposed role of these transporters in driving acinar cl- entry (9-14). na+
is then thought to enter the acinar lumen through the acinar tight junctions to neutralize the
lumen-negative transepithelial potential created by the accumulation of cl-, and water follows
the resulting nacl osmotic gradient.
the salivary na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter has been identified as nkcc11 (15), a member
of the mammalian, cation-chloride cotransporter gene family (16, 17). other members of this
family include at least four distinct k+/cl- cotransporters (18), a na+/cl- cotransporter (19),
and a renal na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter isoform (20, 21).  xxxg2079xxx  is referred to as the “secretory”
cotransporter isoform, although it is not necessarily involved in secretion in all secretory

across the basolateral membrane of acinar cells, resulting in a 4-5 fold intracellular accumulation

epithelia in which it is expressed. surprisingly, for example, in  xxxg2079xxx  knockout mice, gastric
acid secretion in adults was not impaired, nor was intestinal fluid secretion in suckling pups (22),
two tissues where significant levels of this transporter have been detected (23, 24).
considerable evidence supporting the involvement of na+/k+/2cl- cotransport in the
secretion of saliva has been generated over the past two decades (9-14). however, this
relationship is primarily based on indirect evidence derived from experiments that (necessarily)
employed non-physiological ion substitutions and/or, in some cases, relatively non-selective

the relationship of  xxxg2079xxx  expression to cl- uptake and in vivo salivation, we examined the
effects of  xxxg2079xxx  gene disruption (see 22) on mouse parotid gland function. our results
demonstrate that  xxxg2079xxx  is located in the basolateral membranes of wild-type mouse parotid
acinar cells, consistent with its proposed role in salivary secretion. relative to wild-type mice, in
 xxxg2079xxx  knockout mice there is a dramatic reduction in acinar cl- influx in vitro and a severe
deficit in the secretion of saliva measured in vivo. this reduced flow is also associated with an
inability to conserve nacl, apparently due to decreased expression of the epithelial na+ channel
enac in the salivary ducts of  xxxg2079xxx  knockout mice.

inhibitors to infer the role of  xxxg2079xxx  in acinar function. therefore, in order to directly explore

experimental procedures
materials and null mutant animals - all chemicals were from the sigma chemical
company, st. louis, mo. targeted disruption of the murine  xxxg2079xxx  gene was performed as
described by flagella (22). heterozygous offspring were used to establish breeding colonies in
the university of rochester vivarium. all animals were housed in micro-isolator cages with
access to laboratory chow and water ad libitum with a 12 hour light/dark cycle. experiments
were carried out on animals aged between 2 and 4 months. body and parotid gland weights were

immunohistochemistry - the antibody alpha-wnt, raised in rabbits against a 6xhis fusion
protein corresponding to amino acids 3-202 of rat  xxxg2079xxx  (25), was used for
immunolocalization experiments.

parotid glands from wild-type and  xxxg2079xxx  -/- (negative

control) animals were removed, dispersed as described below, and fixed for 30 min with 3%
paraformaldehyde. cells were permeabilized and non-specific binding sites blocked as
previously described (26). cells were incubated overnight at 4oc with 150 µl of blocking serum
containing a 1:5,000 dilution of alpha-wnt, and then treated with fitc-labeled secondary antibody
(1:50 goat anti-rabbit, jackson immunoresearch laboratory, pa) for 1 hr at room temperature.
images were recorded and analyzed using a leica confocal microscope.
morphological analyses - for light and electron microscopic studies of the parotid gland,
mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/10 mg, i.p.) and perfused intracardially
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, ph 7.4. the glands were excised,
immersed in fixative for an additional 3-4 hr, then trimmed into small pieces and rinsed in 0.1 m
cacodylate buffer.

ferricyanide in cacodylate buffer, then stained in block with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate. after
dehydration in graded ethanol solutions and substitution with propylene oxide, the tissues were
embedded in polybed epoxy resin (polysciences). for light microscopy, 1-µm sections were
stained with  xxxd2610xxx -azure ii and examined in a leitz orthoplan microscope. thin
sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a philips cm10 tem.
acinar cell preparation and in vitro intracellular cl- and ph measurements -

microfluorimetric experiments to measure intracellular cl- concentration were carried out in a

0.8; nah2po4, 0.33; kh2po4, 0.4; glucose, 10; hepes, 20 (ph 7.4 with naoh) and glutamine,
2. measurements of cl-/hco3- exchanger activity were performed in hco3--replete pss in
which 25 mm nacl was substituted with 25 mm nahco3. chloride salts were replaced with
gluconate salts in the cl--free, hco3--containing solution. in this latter solution, the
concentration of  xxxd409xxx  was increased to 5.2 mm to compensate for chelation of
calcium by gluconate. hco3--free and hco3--containing solutions were continuously gassed
with 100% o2 or 95% o2/5% co2, respectively.
parotid acini (5-20 cells) were prepared from  xxxg2079xxx  littermates of wild-type (+/+) and
knockout (-/-) genotype by collagenase digestion (7, 27). in brief, glands removed from male
and female animals were minced in ice-cold earle’s minimum essential medium (biofluids,
rockville, md) supplemented with 0.075u/ml collagenase p, 2 mm glutamine and 0.1% bsa,
and incubated in the same medium at 37oc for 75 min. the final acinar preparation was either:

physiological salt solution (pss) containing (mm): nacl, 135; kcl, 5.4; cacl2, 1.2;  xxxd2534xxx ,

1) resuspended in pss containing nahco3, and loaded with the ph-sensitive fluorescent
indicator bcecf by incubation with bcecf/am (2µm) for 30 min; or 2) resuspended in
hco3--free pss, and loaded with the halide-sensitive fluorescent indicator by incubation with 500 µm
spq for 15 min.
intracellular bcecf fluorescence was monitored in ratio mode from single acinar clumps
adhering to the base of a superfusion chamber mounted on a nikon diaphot microscope
interfaced with a spex arcm microfluorimeter (edison, nj). cells were excited at 495 and 433

intracellular ph was estimated by in situ calibration of the excitation ratio using the high
k+/nigericin protocol as previously described (7). cl-/hco3- exchanger activity was determined
in bcecf-loaded acinar cells by switching the superfusate to a hco3--containing, cl--free
salt solution. this maneuver results in an intracellular alkaline load in cells with functional
anion exchanger activity (28).
intracellular fluorescence of the cl--sensitive dye spq was monitored in cells excited
with the uv bands generated by an enterprise argon laser (ultima confocal microscope, genomic
solutions, ann arbor, mi) and emitted fluorescence measured at >400 nm. spq fluorescence
was normalized to that observed from resting (unstimulated) acini and cl- concentration is
expressed as 1/normalized spq fluorescence (1/spq fn).

isolated parotid gland ducts. wild-type and null mutant animals of either sex were anesthetized
with chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and the main excretory duct of the right and
left parotid glands isolated and cut using a dissecting microscope. prior to saliva collection a
tracheal tube was placed to prevent blockage of the windpipe and asphyxiation via excessive
mucous production during secretory stimulation. secretion was initiated by the injection of the
muscarinic agonist  xxxd2950xxx  (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and saliva collected from the cut end of each
duct in a calibrated glass micropipette (sigma chemical co.) by capillary flow. the rate of fluid

every 5 min. each animal was weighed prior to the experiment and parotid glands were
subsequently dissected, trimmed free of connective tissue and weighed. for data presentation,
the volume of saliva secreted and the rate of parotid saliva flow were normalized to parotid gland
weight. results are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. of the saliva flow from both the right and left
glands from n animals measured at each time point.
collected saliva samples were analyzed for total na and k content by atomic absorption
using a perkin-elmer 3030 spectrophotometer.

sample osmolality was measured using a

wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer and cl- activity was determined using an orion
research model ea 940 expandable ion analyzer.
northern blot analysis – total rna was isolated from parotid glands of mice using
trizol reagent (gibco brl), followed by  xxxd81xxx  selection on an oligo(dt) cellulose column
(gibco, brl). each gland sample was pooled from three mice. northern blots were prepared and
hybridized as previously described (28) using cdna probes for  xxxg2079xxx  (rat nts 3368-3563,
accession number af051561), ae2 (mouse nts 1300-1776, accession number j04036),  xxxg2162xxx

(mouse nts 3078-3244, accession number k02060) was used to normalize expression between
preparations. quantitation of the autoradiographs was performed by densitometry using the
alpha imager system (alpha innotech corp., san leandro, ca).

results
localization of  xxxg2079xxx  protein in mouse parotid gland - to better understand the
function of  xxxg2079xxx  expressed in mouse parotid glands we first documented its distribution by
immunohistochemistry.  xxxg2079xxx  has been observed in the basolateral membrane of acinar (15),
but not duct cells in the rat parotid gland2, whereas, both acinar and some duct cells were labeled
in rat submandibular gland (29). fig. 1a shows that  xxxg2079xxx  is localized to the basolateral
membrane of acinar cells from the parotid gland of wild type mice. fig. 1b is a nomarski image

and d). furthermore, verifying the specificity of the antibody, no staining was detected in parotid
acini from  xxxg2079xxx  null mutant (-/-) mice (fig. 1e and f). taken together, these experiments
confirmed the localization of the  xxxg2079xxx  isoform to the basolateral membrane of mouse parotid
acinar cells.
loss of bumetanide-sensitive cl- uptake in acinar cells from  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice in rat parotid acinar cells, the primary mechanism for cl- re-uptake during fluid secretion
appears to be a bumetanide-sensitive na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter (11, 12).

to determine

whether a similar mechanism is present in mouse parotid acini, cells were loaded with the cl-sensitive dye spq and stimulated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol. panel a of fig. 2
shows a rapid loss of intracellular cl- following stimulation of acinar cells isolated from wildtype mice (+/+), presumably mediated by ca2+-activated cl- channels (4). this cl- efflux is
followed by a slower, bumetanide-sensitive cl- re-uptake, similar to previous observations in
rat parotid gland (11, 12). in acinar cells isolated from mice lacking expression of  xxxg2079xxx  (-/12

of the same field. in contrast, duct cells failed to stain with the anti- xxxg2079xxx  antibody (fig. 1c

), the initial channel mediated, cl- loss in response to muscarinic stimulation was intact,
however cl- re-uptake was virtually absent (fig. 2, panel b).
 xxxg2079xxx  expression is required for muscarinic agonist-induced in vivo salivation - to

determine whether decreased in vitro cl- uptake translates into decreased in vivo salivation,
 xxxd2950xxx stimulated parotid saliva was collected from  xxxg2079xxx  wild-type and null mutant mice
over a 50 min time period. fig. 3a shows that targeted disruption of  xxxg2079xxx  (-/-; open circles)
reduced the total volume of  xxxd2950xxx stimulated saliva secreted during the 50 min collection

rate (fig. 3b) was greatest during the first 5 min period (greater than 85% decrease), inhibiting
secretion by less than 55% at the end of the 50 min collection period.
cl-/hco3- exchanger activity in mouse parotid acinar cells - the above results,
showing loss of cl- re-uptake in vitro (fig. 2) and severe hyposalivation in vivo from the
parotid glands of  xxxg2079xxx  -/- mice (fig. 3), directly demonstrate that  xxxg2079xxx  is a major ion
transport pathway involved in the fluid secretion process.

however, another cl- uptake

mechanism must be present because: 1) parotid acinar cells from knockout mice efflux cl- upon
stimulation, demonstrating the ability to concentrate intracellular cl- above electrochemical
equilibrium, and 2) these glands continue to secrete saliva, although at a dramatically reduced
rate. some exocrine glands employ cl-/hco3- exchangers, coupled with na+/h+ exchangers,
to drive fluid secretion (13, 30), whereas, others do not (31, 32). fig. 4 shows that acinar cells
isolated from both wild-type (panel a) and  xxxg2079xxx -deficient (panel b) mice express such a cl-

/hco3- exchange mechanism. here, cl-/hco3- exchanger activity was detected in acinar cells
by switching the superfusate to a hco3--containing, cl--free salt solution, a maneuver that
raises the intracellular ph in cells with functional anion exchanger activity (13, 28). comparison
of the initial rates of the cl-/hco3- exchanger-mediated alkalinization suggests that acinar
cells isolated from  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice express more activity than cells from wild-type
animals (fig. 4, panel c). the initial rate of the alkalinization upon extracellular cl- removal for

enhanced expression of ae2 transcripts – although the enhanced alkalinization shown in
fig. 4 may be due to several factors, one potential mechanism for increasing cl-/hco3exchanger activity in acinar cells from  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice is to increase ae2 expression, the
cl-/hco3- exchanger isoform expressed in this cell type (29). northern analysis of poly aselected rna using a 3’ cdna probe for  xxxg2079xxx  verified that expression of a 7.4 kb mrna is
eliminated in parotid glands isolated from  xxxg2079xxx  knockout mice (fig. 5, left panel). the right
panel of fig. 5 demonstrates that the level of transcripts for ae2 in the parotid gland was
enhanced by about 30% in null mutant mice relative to wild-type controls. although the
mechanism for this enhanced expression is unclear, these results suggest that cl-/hco3exchanger expression is up-regulated in acinar cells in an attempt to compensate for loss of
 xxxg2079xxx .
targeted disruption of  xxxg2079xxx  inhibits nacl reabsorption - according to the currently
accepted model for salivary secretion (1, 2), the initial step in the formation of saliva is the

secretion of a plasma-like primary fluid from the acinar cells. subsequently, duct cells are
thought to reabsorb much of the secreted nacl in a flow rate dependent fashion, with little or no
reabsorption of water, to produce a final hypotonic saliva. to examine the effects of
nkcc1disruption on the final salivary fluid, parotid saliva was collected from wild-type and null mutant
mice and the na and k content, cl- activity, and osmolality determined. our prediction, based
on the reduced flow in  xxxg2079xxx  null mice, was that the osmolality of their saliva would be reduced
compared with wild-type mice owing to its increased transit time in the ducts. however, fig. 6

deficient mice were significantly elevated compared to that secreted by littermate, wild-type
mice, whereas, no change in k content was detected.
morphology of the parotid gland in  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice - it is hard to account for the
increased na+ and cl- concentrations, and consequently the higher osmolality, of the saliva
from  xxxg2079xxx  knockout mice within the two-stage secretion hypothesis described above without
suggesting that the reabsorption of salt by the ducts is reduced. it is often possible to predict
functional changes induced by gene disruption by examining the morphology of affected organs
(33, 34). thus, morphological changes in the ducts of  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice may reflect some
sort of compensatory mechanism associated with chronically low saliva output. to test this
hypothesis, parotid glands of  xxxg2079xxx  +/+ and -/- mice were examined by light and electron
microscopy.
as previously described (22), homozygous  xxxg2079xxx  mutants exhibited decreased rates of
postnatal growth resulting in significantly lower body weights than their wild-type littermates.
in the present experiments, mean body weights for wild-type animals were 31.3 ± 1.2 gm (+/+, n

= 24) and 24.2 ± 1.2 for  xxxg2079xxx  mutant mice (-/-, n = 15; p < 0.003 compared to +/+, unpaired
student’s t test). loss of body weight did not correlate with a decrease in parotid gland weight.
in fact, the parotid glands were larger in knockout mice: parotid weights (mg) were 38.2 ± 1.9
(+/+, n = 24) and 49.1 ± 4.0 (-/-, n = 13; p < 0.022 compared to +/+). no obvious differences
between +/+ and -/- mice were observed with regard to acinar and duct cell morphology (fig.
7).

in particular, the apical cell surface and junctional complexes, extent of basolateral

membrane infolding, and the size and number of mitochondria in the striated duct cells appeared

acinar and duct cells, and the ratio of acinar to ductal elements in the glands appeared
comparable between the +/+ and -/- mice, although detailed morphometric analyses to confirm
these observations were not performed.
decreased expression of alpha, beta and gamma enac transcripts in  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice – nacl
reabsorption by salivary ducts is likely to be driven by na+ uptake via the epithelial na+ channel
enac and/or na+/h+ exchange (both nhe2 and  xxxg2162xxx  are expressed in the apical membrane of
duct cells; see 26, 29, 35). northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether the
expression of transcripts for these proteins was affected by disrupting the expression of  xxxg2079xxx .
active enac na+ channels require the co-expression of alpha, beta and gamma subunits. the left panels of
fig. 8 demonstrates that transcripts for the alpha, beta and gamma subunits were decreased approximately 10,
40 and 80%, respectively, when normalized to l32 ribosomal mrna. in contrast,  xxxg2162xxx 
expression was unchanged (right panel of fig. 8). taken together, these results indicate that the
inability of ducts in  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice to reabsorb nacl correlates with decreased
expression of the na+ channel enac.

discussion
most reports of oral dryness correlate with side effects of medications, immunological
diseases such as sjögren’s syndrome, radiation treatment for head and neck cancers, or ductal
obstructions (36-38). however, in a significant sub-population of individuals (up to 20%), the
cause of dry mouth is unknown (39, 40). it is likely that genetic defects make up a subset of this
idiopathic patient population, particularly defects involving critical components of the fluid
secretion process. indirect evidence suggests that the na+/k+/2cl- cotransport mechanism plays

12). up-regulation of the na+/k+/2cl- cotransport activity occurs in response to agonists that
mobilize intracellular ca2+ (6), the primary in vivo secretion signal, as well as agonists that
potentiate secretion by increasing camp (41). the objective of the current study was to
determine directly, using knockout mice, the involvement of the  xxxg2079xxx  isoform in salivary
gland fluid secretion, and thus provide insight into potential mechanisms of “idiopathic” dry
mouth disease. other functional effects of disrupting the expression of the murine  xxxg2079xxx  gene
have been previously reported (22, 42).  xxxg2079xxx  appears to be critical for secretion, most notably
in organs such as the trachea, jejunum, cecum and those involved in hearing and balance (22,
42). however,  xxxg2079xxx  is not the only transport mechanism driving secretion since acid secretion
by the adult stomach and fluid secretion by the intestine of young mice was normal in animals
lacking expression of  xxxg2079xxx  (22).
in the present study,  xxxg2079xxx  was localized to the basolateral membrane of mouse parotid
acinar cells, but was not detected in duct cells. the distribution of this labeling was confirmed
using "negative control" parotid glands from  xxxg2079xxx  null mutant animals, in which staining was

an important role in the production and regulation of fluid secretion by salivary glands (3, 6, 9-

absent in acinar cells. the presence of  xxxg2079xxx  in rat submandibular duct cells (29), but not
mouse (fig. 1) and rat parotid ducts (15) suggests a gland-specific difference. nevertheless,
functional cotransporter activity has not been reported in duct cells for any salivary gland,
including the rat parotid (43) and submandibular glands (44).
in vitro studies revealed that the bumetanide-sensitive uptake of cl- was absent in
 xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice.

consistent with this observation, in vivo functional studies

demonstrated that knockout of this gene dramatically reduced the total volume of saliva secreted

secretion by regulating acinar cl- entry. these results are the first to directly establish that
 xxxg2079xxx  is a major transport protein involved in modulating the rate of saliva secretion. it is
interesting to note that the magnitude of the inhibition of the salivary flow rate in mice lacking
 xxxg2079xxx  decreased over time, from greater than 85% inhibition during the first 5 min, to less than
55% after 50 min stimulation. these results are in agreement with earlier studies where
na+/k+/2cl- cotransport was shown to initially be the dominant cl- uptake mechanism driving fluid
secretion (9-12), whereas cl-/hco3- exchange contributed more to cl- influx during sustained
muscarinic stimulation (13), as the intracellular ph increased due to enhanced na+/h+
exchanger activity (45, 46). thus, the saliva secreted by  xxxg2079xxx  null mice is likely dependent on
the cl-/hco3- exchanger activity detected in acinar cells isolated from these animals.
consistent with this possibility, transcripts for the ae2 cl-/hco3- exchanger were slightly
increased in -/- mice relative to wild-type littermates.

by more than 60%. thus, our data demonstrate that  xxxg2079xxx  controls the rate of salivary gland

duct cells modify acinar cell secretions primarily by absorbing nacl to produce a final
hypotonic saliva.

this process is dependent on the salivary flow rate because the ductal

reabsorption mechanisms saturate at higher flows (see 1, 2). duct cells possess two potential na+
uptake mechanisms in their lumenal membrane. the first of these is na+/h+ exchange, although
functional studies have not indicated a major role for this apical pathway.

the second

mechanism is an amiloride-sensitive na+ channel (47), likely the epithelial na+ channel enac
(48). therefore, because of the reduced flow rate, it was surprising to find that saliva from

from wild-type littermates (fig. 6). the interpretation of these results is difficult to understand in
terms of the two-stage secretion model since parotid duct cells do not express detectable levels
of  xxxg2079xxx . the increased osmolality of saliva from mice lacking  xxxg2079xxx  is due to an increase
in nacl content (see fig. 6) and not an increase in the protein concentration (data not shown).
one potential mechanism for the reduction in the reabsorption of nacl by parotid ducts
may be that the chronically low flow of saliva in  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice induced changes in ion
transporter capacity; e.g., as has been noted in the colon of  xxxg2162xxx -deficient mice (28, 49). these
changes might be associated with altered duct cell morphology. however, we were unable to
detect any morphological changes in duct cells consistent with this hypothesis, although we
cannot rule out the possibility that functional changes have occurred that are unapparent
morphologically. another possibility is that this is an adaptive mechanism to increase the final
salivary flow. although little fluid reabsorption is thought to occur in the ducts, any that does
occur is presumably a consequence of ductal salt reabsorption. thus, down regulating this
process would spare whatever fluid is lost in the ducts. in any case, the expression of the alpha, beta

 xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice had elevated osmolality compared to that measured in saliva collected

and gamma subunits of enac was reduced. these results strongly suggest that the inability of the ducts
to produce hypotonic saliva in  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mice is linked to decreased ability of these
cells to uptake na+ mediated by enac.
in conclusion, the  xxxg2079xxx  knockout mouse presents an excellent system for in vivo and in
vitro studies of cl--dependent fluid secretion, as well as providing a potential animal model for
human genetic defects that produce “idiopathic” dry mouth disease. the present study
demonstrates, utilizing an  xxxg2079xxx -deficient mouse model, that the basolateral na+/k+/2cl-

in vivo. by regulating intracellular cl- uptake, this isoform plays a key role in driving and
maintaining the transepithelial movement of cl- ions across acinar cells.
