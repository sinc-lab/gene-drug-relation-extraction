abstract
rationale prepulse inhibition (ppi) is an operational measure
of sensorimotor gating that is deficient in schizophrenia
patients. in rats, ppi deficits induced by dopamine (da)
agonists are reversed by antipsychotics. inhibition of the
striatum-rich phosphodiesterase (pde)10a may represent a
novel antipsychotic mechanism. previous studies were controversial, showing antipsychotic-like profiles in measures of
ppi for the preferential  xxxg1690xxx  inhibitor papaverine (pap)
but not the novel  xxxg1690xxx  inhibitor tp-10.
objective the aim of the study was to evaluate the
antipsychotic profile of pap in rats using ppi.
materials and methods ppi deficits were induced in rats by
apomorphine (apo; 0.1, 0.5 mg/kg) or d-amphetamine
(amph; 4 mg/kg). pap (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) or haloperidol
(hal; 0.1 mg/kg) was tested against these agonists in
sprague–dawley (sd) or wistar (wi) rats. prepulse
intervals ranged from 10 to 120 ms. further tests evaluated
the effects of pap on spontaneous locomotion, amph
(1 mg/kg)-induced hyperlocomotion, and core body
temperature (t°).
results hal reversed apo-induced ppi deficits but pap
failed to reverse apo- and amph-induced ppi deficits at
all doses, strains, pretreatment times, and prepulse intervals.
pap (30 mg/kg) significantly reduced amph hyperlocomotion in sd rats, and a similar pattern was detected in wi
rats. this pap dose also strongly reduced spontaneous
locomotion and t° in sd rats.
conclusion our study does not support an antipsychoticlike profile of pap in dopaminergic ppi models.

introduction
prepulse inhibition (ppi) of startle is a cross-species
phenomenon that occurs when a weak lead stimulus
inhibits the response to an intense, abrupt startling stimulus
(graham 1975). ppi is reduced in schizophrenia patients
and their unaffected first-degree relatives (braff et al. 1978;
cadenhead et al. 2000; braff et al. 2001; kumari et al.
2005). these studies suggest that deficient ppi may
represent a useful schizophrenia endophenotype—i.e., an
intermediate between genes and the more complex clinical
disease manifestations (gottesman and gould 2003; turetsky
et al. 2007)—that can be studied under controlled laboratory
conditions.
ppi deficits in schizophrenia are modeled in rats by
dopamine (da) receptor agonists and nmda receptor
antagonists, consistent with the dopaminergic and glutamatergic hypotheses of schizophrenia (randrup and munkvad
1972; javitt and zukin 1991). ppi deficits induced by da
agonists like the mixed d1/d2 agonist, apomorphine (apo),
or the da releaser, d-amphetamine (amph) are reversed by
typical and atypical antipsychotics and are used in predictive
models for antipsychotic drug discovery (mansbach et al.
1988; swerdlow et al. 1994).
all approved antipsychotics functionally antagonize neurotransmission at the da  xxxg656xxx , a g-protein-coupled
receptor with inhibitory function on adenylate cyclase (ac;
senogles 1994). this suggests that one source of potentially
novel targets for antipsychotic drug discovery may be
downstream of d2 receptors, i.e., within the da d2 signaling
cascade. in particular, drugs that elevate camp within d2-

do01419; no of pages

expressing neurons in the striatum may yield a d2 antagonistlike effect. such drugs may include certain inhibitors of
phosphodiesterases (pde), i.e., degrading enzymes of camp
and/or cgmp (c.f. halene and siegel 2007).
supporting evidence for this hypothesis comes from
several ppi studies. reduced ppi in postpartum rats is
associated with reduced nucleus accumbens (nac)—but
not dorsal striatum-camp content (byrnes et al. 2007).
similarly, studies in pde-4b knock-out (ko) mice
demonstrated marked ppi deficits together with increased
startle amplitudes (siuciak et al. 2008). culm et al. (2004)
demonstrated that d2 stimulation disrupts ppi by activating
the inhibitory galphai/o proteins in the nucleus accumbens
(nac), thereby reducing camp signaling by inhibiting ac
activity. furthermore, ppi is impaired in mice by intracerebroventricular administration of rp-camps, a competitive
inhibitor of camp  xxxg1836xxx  types i and ii, and is
increased by the selective pde4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx  (kelly et al.
2007). notably,  xxxd3142xxx  also blocks the ppi-disruptive effects
of amph in mice (kanes et al. 2007; kelly et al. 2007).
thus, in both rat and mouse models, reduced forebrain camp
activity appears to be associated with ppi deficits. however, a
recent study with a ro-20-1724, another selective pde4
inhibitor, demonstrated an antipsychotic-like profile of this
compound in models of auditory event-related potentials, but
not in measures of amph-induced ppi deficits (halene and
siegel 2008).
among all drug candidates that elevate camp,  xxxg1690xxx 
inhibitors have stirred the most attention due to the highly
localized expression levels of pde10, particularly in the
striatum (seeger et al. 2003; xie et al. 2006).  xxxg1690xxx  is a
recently discovered pde subtype that hydrolyzes both
camp and cgmp (fujishige et al. 1999). high levels of
 xxxg1690xxx  protein and mrna have been discovered in
gabaergic medium spiny neurons of the nac, caudate
nucleus, and olfactory tubercle (seeger et al. 2003).
medium spiny neurons are the predominant cell type of
this brain region. they represent a convergence site for
glutamatergic input from cortical and thalamic regions and
dopaminergic input from the midbrain. a recent study in
our laboratory has detected significant differences in
 xxxg1690xxx  gene expression in the nac between sprague–
dawley (sd) and long evans (le) rats. compared to le
rats, sd rats had significantly higher pde expression levels
(p<10−6), and this corresponded to higher sensitivity to the
ppi-disruptive effects of da agonists in sd rats (shilling et
al. 2008). recent studies with papaverine (pap), a  xxxg1690xxx 
inhibitor with ≥9 times lower ic50 values for  xxxg1690xxx  than
for the other members of the pde family (siuciak et al.
2006), have demonstrated an antipsychotic-like profile of
pap in a paradigm of attentional set-shifting in rats designed
to reflect frontal function in man (rodefer et al. 2005). an
antipsychotic-like profile of pap was further observed in the

psychopharmacology (2009) 203:723–735

conditioned avoidance (car) model and in d-amphetamine
(amph)- and pcp-induced hyperlocomotion tests (siuciak
et al. 2006). similar effects were observed with the novel,
more selective  xxxg1690xxx  inhibitor tp-10. importantly, this
compound also displayed an antipsychotic-like profile in a
model of amph-induced event-related potential (erp)
sensory gating deficits (schmidt et al. 2008).
data available on pde10 inhibitors in models of
sensorimotor gating are controversial at present. bleickardt
et al. (2007) and lu et al. (2007) reported data in abstract
form showing that pap reverses mk-801-induced ppi
deficits in rats and mice and apo-induced ppi deficits in
rats. in contrast, a recent study with the novel  xxxg1690xxx 
inhibitor tp-10 showed that tp-10 reversed neither baseline
ppi deficits in c57/bl6 mice nor mk-801-induced ppi
deficits in cd1 mice (schmidt et al. 2008).
in the present study, we tested the effects of the
commercially available pde10 inhibitor pap, in a range of
da-related ppi models. ppi studies were complemented by
measures of amph-induced hyperlocomotion, spontaneous
locomotion, and drug-induced hypothermia to evaluate
bioavailability/bioactivity and drug effects on general motor
behavior.

materials and methods
experimental animals adult male sd (n=131) and wi
(n=19) rats (225–250 g; harlan laboratories, livermore,
ca, usa) were housed in groups of two to three animals
per cage and maintained on a reversed light/dark schedule
with water and food available ad libitum. rats were
handled within 2 days of arrival. testing occurred during
the dark phase. all experiments were carried out in
accordance with the national institute of health guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals (nih publications
no. 80-23) and were approved by the ucsd animal
subjects committee (protocol #s01221).
drugs d- xxxd163xxx , apomorphine hydrochloride
hemihydrate,  xxxd228xxx , and papaverine hydrochloride
were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo, usa).
haloperidol (hal) solution was purchased from novation
(irving, tx, usa). apo (0.1, 0.5 mg/kg), amph (1, 4 mg/kg),
and hal (0.1 mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously in a
volume of 1 ml/kg. pap (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) was administered
intraperitoneally in a volume of 1.5–2 ml/kg. these doses of
pap were selected based on published in vivo assays in rodents
in which pap had significant behavioral or neurochemical
effects (see, e.g., bleickardt et al. 2007; lu et al. 2007; rodefer
et al. 2005; siuciak et al. 2006). vehicle for amph, hal,
and pap was saline and 0.01% ascorbate/saline for apo. all
doses are based on milligram per kilogram of salts.

apparatus startle chambers were housed in a soundattenuated room and consisted of a plexiglas cylinder
8.2 cm in diameter resting on a 12.5×25.5-cm plexiglas
frame within a ventilated enclosure. noise bursts were
presented via a speaker mounted 24 cm above the cylinder.
a piezoelectric accelerometer mounted below the plexiglas
frame detected and transduced motion from within the
cylinder. stimulus delivery was controlled by the sr-lab
microcomputer and interface assembly, which also digitized
(0-4095), rectified, and recorded stabilimeter readings.
one-hundred-one-millisecond readings were collected
beginning at stimulus onset. startle amplitude was defined
as the average of 100 readings.

startle testing procedure
two to 6 days before ppi drug studies were begun, rats
were exposed to a short “matching” startle session. they
were placed in the startle chambers for a 5-min acclimation
period with a 70-db(a) background noise, and then
exposed to a total of 17 p-alone trails (40 ms—120 db
(a) noise bursts) that were interspersed with 3 pp12db+palone trials (p-alone preceded 100 ms (onset-toonset) by a 20-ms noise burst of 12 db above background).
rats were assigned to drug dose groups based on average
%ppi from the matching session.
starting 2–6 days later, the effects of pap were studied
in separate groups of rats, using three different ppi
protocols. all protocols used a 40-ms, 120-db(a) noise
burst as the “p-alone”, and contained trials in which no
stimulus was presented, but cage displacement was measured (nostim trials). intertrial interval was variable and
averaged 15 s. nostim trials were not included in the
calculation of intertrial intervals.
ppi protocol 1 was aimed to replicate key aspects of the
study of bleickardt et al. (2007) and to extend it by a strain
comparison using 12 wi and 12 sd rats. a mixed-model
design was used, with the apo dose (vehicle vs. 0.5 mg/
kg) as the within-factor and the pap dose (vehicle vs.
30 mg/kg) as the between-factor. rats were treated on
2 days with either vehicle or 0.5 mg/kg apo using
pseudorandom and balanced drug orders. intertest interval
was 7 days. apo injections were preceded 30 min by an
injection of pap (30 mg/kg). immediately after the apo
injection, rats were placed in the startle chambers for a 5-min
acclimation period with a 70-db(a) background noise. they
were then exposed to a series of trial types which were
presented in pseudorandom order: (1) p-alone; (2)–(4)
p-alone preceded 100 ms (onset-to-onset) by a 20-ms
noise burst of either 5 (pp5db+p-alone), 10 (pp10db+palone), or 15 db above background (pp15db+palone). interspersed between these trials were nostim

725

trials. the session began with four consecutive p-alone
trials and ended with three consecutive p-alone trials.
between these trials were two blocks, each consisting of
eight p-alone trials, five pp5db+p-alone trials, five
pp10db+p-alone trials, and five pp15db+p-alone
trials. total session duration was 18.25 min.
five days after this pap experiment, these animals were
used in a follow-up ppi experiment using the same session
and experimental design. the typical antipsychotic hal
was used as a positive control to demonstrate assay
sensitivity for the “detection” of antipsychotic-like compounds. animals were “reshuffled” and assigned to dose
groups matched for average %ppi values and previous
pap dose groups. a mixed-model design was used, with
apo dose as the within-factor and hal dose (vehicle vs.
0.1 mg/kg) as the between-factor. rats were treated 2 days
with either vehicle or 0.5 mg/kg apo using pseudorandom and balanced drug orders. intertest interval was
7 days. apo injections were preceded 10 min by an
injection of hal (0.1 mg/kg). immediately after the apo
injection, rats were placed in the startle chambers and the
session described above was begun (protocol 1, see
above).
ppi protocol 2 was identical to protocol 1, but used a
pretreatment time for pap of 5 min relative to the da
agonist apo (0.5 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg) or amph (4 mg/kg).
the time difference between the agonist injection and the
beginning of the experiment was 0 min for apo and 10 min
for amph. these conditions were chosen to optimize
bioavailability/bioactivity for pap (see data from t° and
locomotor experiments (figs. 6 and 7) and siuciak et al.
2006) and the da agonists. based on strong evidence for
bioactivity of pap in assays of t° and amph-induced
hyperlocomotion in particular in sd rats (see below), only
sd rats (n=50) from harlan laboratories were used for these
experiments. two apo studies were carried out, one using a
standard dose of apo (0.5 mg/kg) and one using a low dose
of apo (0.1 mg/kg). intertest interval was 6–7 days.
ppi protocol 3 also used a 5-min pretreatment time and
sd (n=24) rats only. this session included prepulse
intervals ranging from 10 to 120 ms, to enable the detection
of antipsychotic-like effects at a wider range of prepulse
intervals (see, e.g., swerdlow et al. 2004). a mixed-model
design was used, with the apo dose (vehicle vs. 0.5 mg/
kg) as the within-factor and the pap dose (vehicle 3, 10,
30 mg/kg) as the between factor. rats were treated 2 days
with either vehicle or 0.5 mg/kg apo using pseudorandom
and balanced drug orders. intertest interval was 7 days.
immediately after the apo injection, rats were placed in the
startle chambers for a 5-min acclimation period with a 70db(a) background noise. they were then exposed to a
series of trial types which were presented in pseudorandom
order: (1) p-alone; (2)–(5) p-alone preceded by a

726

prepulse of 5 ms duration and a prepulse amplitude of 15 db
above background, which was presented either 10 (pp10ms+palone), 20 (pp20ms+p-alone), 30 (pp30ms+p-alone),
60 (pp60ms+p-alone), or 120 ms (pp120ms+p-alone)
prior the pulse (onset-to-onset). interspersed between these
trials were nostim trials. the session began with three
consecutive p-alone trials and ended with three consecutive
p-alone trials. between these trials was one block consisting
of six p-alone, six pp10ms+p-alone, six pp20ms+palone, six pp30ms+p-alone, six pp60ms+p-alone, or
six pp120ms+p-alone trials. total session duration was
15.5 min.
locomotor protocols
d-amphetamine-induced

hyperlocomotion amph-induced
hyperactivity was recorded in sd (n=8) and wi rats (n=7).
the testing protocol was based on schmidt et al. (2008) and
swerdlow et al. (2006). recordings were obtained during
the dark cycle of the animals. the experimental room was
illuminated, providing ∼40 lx in the middle of the
locomotor cages. a background of 60 db(a) white noise
was used. rats were brought into the laboratory and placed
into individual cages without water and food for 1–2 h of
adaptation prior to placement into the locomotor cages.
locomotor cages were wire-mesh photocell cages (22×35×
15 cm) fitted with two parallel infrared beams 1 cm above the
floor, perpendicular to the long axis of the cage. the total
number of beam breaks was calculated for each 10 min interval
during all tests. rats were acclimated to the locomotor cages for
180 min 1 day prior to their first drug test and these data were
used to assign animals to “activity-matched” dose groups. rats
were treated 2 days with either vehicle or 30 mg/kg pap using a
within-subjects, pseudorandom and balanced drug order
design. intertest interval was 7 days. on test days, rats were
placed in the activity chambers for 60 min, then removed and
immediately injected with pap (0, 30 mg/kg). rats were then
returned to their individual cages and then injected 5 min later
with amph (1 mg/kg). immediately after the amph injection,
rats were returned to the activity chambers for a recording
duration of 180 min.
spontaneous locomotion the effect of pap on spontaneous
locomotor activity was recorded in 22 sd rats. the
procedure for spontaneous locomotion testing was identical
to the one described for d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity testing, except that the experiment was designed to
achieve sufficient and sustained baseline locomotor activity
by non-pharmacological means: (1) rats naive to the
experimental environment were used, (2) recordings began
at the beginning of the dark cycle, and (3) the room was
dark throughout the recording. rats were brought into the
laboratory and placed into individual cages without water

psychopharmacology (2009) 203:723–735

and food for ∼45 min of adaptation prior to drug treatment.
rats were randomly assigned to dose groups and treated
with either vehicle or 30 mg/kg pap using a betweensubjects design. after the injections, rats were returned to
their individual cages for 5 min. after the waiting period
and coinciding with the onset of the dark cycle, rats were
placed in activity chambers for 180 min.

drug-induced hypothermia
t° was recorded in 15 sd rats. the protocol was modified
from zhang et al. (2007). one day prior to the first drug
testing, an “adaptation session” was carried out to familiarize
the rats with the testing procedure. rats were brought to the
testing room and placed into individual cages without water
and food. after approximately 2.5 h of adaptation to the
experimental environment, core body temperature measurements were begun. a rat rectal probe (model ret-2-iso,
physitemp instruments, clifton, nj, usa) was attached to a
high precision thermometer (hi-lo temp model 8200
(malinckrodt, argyle, ny, usa), manufactured by
sensortek (now physitemp instruments, clifton, nj, usa).
the probe was coated with a lubricant (k-y-jelly, mcneilppc, skillman, nj, usa) and inserted approximately 3 cm
into the rectum. t° was tested a total of three times with
approximately 30 min between recordings. after the adaptation session, rats were returned to the vivarium. drug
testing was begun 1 day after the adaptation session and
consisted of two test days with 7 days between tests, using a
mixed-model, pseudorandom balanced dose order design.
pap treatment (vehicle vs. 30 mg/kg) was used as the
between-factor, and apo treatment (vehicle vs. 0.5 mg/kg)
as the within-factor. a total of three t° recordings were taken
on each test day. the first t° measurement was carried out to
re-familiarize the animals with the procedure, but was not
used for further analysis. thirty minutes thereafter, a baseline
recording was taken. after the baseline recording, rats were
injected with pap (30 mg/kg). to match the timing of drug
effects on behavior with those of protocols 2 and 3 of the ppi
experiment, apo (0.5 mg/kg) was administered 5 min after
pap, and t° recordings were taken 8 min after apo
treatment. thus, t° recordings were taken at a time point
corresponding to the middle of the ppi session of protocol 2,
relative to apo treatment.
data analysis ppi was defined as 100 − [(startle amplitude
on prepulse trials/startle amplitude on p-alone trials) ×
100] and was analyzed by mixed design anovas. other
anovas were used to assess p-alone magnitude. ppi
data were collapsed across prepulse intensities. nostim
levels revealed very small signal amplitudes (<1% of pulse
alone amplitudes) and followed previously published patterns.

psychopharmacology (2009) 203:723–735
d-amphetamine-induced

hyperactivity data were analyzed by
anovas, with strain as between-subject factor and pap dose
group, and time as the within-subject factors. an initial
anova was carried out to test for differences in baseline
activity prior to administration of amph and pap. after no
significant differences between pap dose groups were found,
a second anova was carried out for the activity data
recorded during the first 2 h after drug administration. for the
spontaneous locomotor data, the first 120 min of activity was
analyzed by anovas, with pap dose group as betweensubject factor and time (10 min intervals) as the within-subject
factor. for t° comparisons between pap dose groups, an
anova was first carried out to test for differences in baseline
t° values. after no significant baseline differences between
dose groups were detected, the drug-induced change in t°
(t°post-injection − t°baseline) was calculated and submitted to an
anova. post hoc comparisons of significant interactions and
relevant main factor effects were conducted using fisher’s
plsd and anova tests. alpha was 0.05. when multiple
post hoc comparisons were carried out for locomotor-based
tests, significance levels were bonferroni-adjusted for the
number of time intervals.

anova of %ppi revealed significant main effects of
apo dose (f=41.52, df 1, 20, p<0.0001), a trend towards a
main effect of hal (f=3.49, df 1, 20, p=0.076), but no
significant main effect of strain (f=2.93, df 1, 20, ns).
there was a significant apo × hal interaction (f=27.00,

interaction (f<1), no strain × hal interaction (f<1), and
no strain × apo × hal interaction (f=2.34, df 1, 20, ns;
fig. 1a,b). the critical apo × hal interaction was
statistically significant in both sd (p<0.0001) and wi rats
(p<0.05). thus, hal significantly opposed apo-induced
ppi deficits in this paradigm.
anova of startle magnitude on p-alone trials
revealed no significant main effects of apo dose (f<1),
hal dose (f=1.28, df 1, 20, ns), or strain (f<1). there
was a trend towards a strain × hal interaction (f=3.66, df
1, 20, p=0.07), indicative of startle suppression by hal in
wi but not in sd rats, no apo × hal interaction (f<1),
no strain × apo interaction (f=1.83 df 1, 20, ns), or strain
× apo × hal interaction (f<1; fig. 1, insets).

significant interactions of strain × apo (f=2.76, df 1,

fig. 2 insets).
standard vs. low doses of apomorphine (ppi protocol 2)
another series of ppi studies tested the effects of pap on
ppi deficits induced by a standard or a low dose of apo in
sd rats under conditions of optimized pap bioavailability/
bioactivity as indicated by the locomotor and hypothermia
experiments, described below (pretreatment time for pap,
5 min).
first, a standard dose of apo (0.5 mg/kg) was tested
against pap (30 mg/kg). anova of %ppi revealed a
significant main effect of apo dose (f=100.98, df 1, 10,
p<0.0001), no effect of pap (f<1), and no significant
apo × pap interaction effect (f<1, fig. 3a). anova of
startle magnitude on p-alone trials revealed no significant
main effects of apo dose (f<1), pap dose (f=1.40, df 1,
10, ns), and no apo × pap interaction (f<1; fig. 3a inset).
second, to test if pap (30 mg/kg) can reverse more subtle
apo-induced ppi deficits, a lower apo dose (0.1 mg/kg)
was used. anova of %ppi revealed a main effect of apo
dose (f=45.65, df 1, 18, p<0.0001), no effect of pap (f<1),
and no significant apo × pap interaction effect (f<1,
fig. 3b). anova of startle magnitude on p-alone trials
revealed a significant effect of pap (f=7.27, df 1, 18,
p<0.02), but not of apo dose (f=1.54, df 1, 18, ns), and no
apo × pap interaction effect (f<1; fig. 3b inset).
to evaluate if pap effects on startle magnitude could be
related to the lack of pap effects on ppi, subgroups of rats
were created by consecutively eliminating “high startlers”
in the vehicle group and “low startlers” in the pap group
until the startle magnitude in vehicle vs. pap-treated rats
were matched. pulse alone amplitudes (mean ± sem) in
these subsets of rats (n=5/pap dose group) were: vehicle/
vehicle treatment (122±47), pap/vehicle treatment (130±
10); vehicle/apo (109±20), pap/apo (127±15). in these
subsets of rats, %ppi followed the same pattern as in the
full sample. %ppi (mean ± sem) values were: vehicle/
vehicle treatment (80±8), pap/vehicle treatment (74±4);
vehicle/apo (56±10), pap/apo (52±11). in particular,
there was no indication in favor of a reversal of apoinduced ppi deficits by pap (f<1 for the pap × apo
interaction), indicating that pap effects on startle magnitude cannot account for the lack of an antipsychotic-like
profile of pap in this study.
multiple prepulse intervals (ppi protocol 3) here the
effects of pap were tested against apo (0.5 mg/kg)-induced
ppi deficits in sd rats at a wider range of (1) prepulse
intervals (10 to 120 ms), (2) doses (3 to 30 mg/kg), and (3)

psychopharmacology (2009) 203:723–735

under conditions of optimized bioavailability/bioactivity
(pretreatment time for pap, 5 min; figs. 6 and 7).
anova of %ppi revealed significant main effects of
apo dose (f=10.95, df 1, 20, p<0.005), a main effect of
prepulse interval (f=18.25, df 4, 80, p<0.0001), and an
apo × prepulse interval interaction (f=10.945, df 12, 80,
p<0.005), as observed previously (swerdlow et al. 2004).
the critical interactions of apo × pap, and apo × pap ×
prepulse interval, the interaction of pap × prepulse
interval, and the main effect of pap, all failed to reach
statistical significance (f<1 for all cases; fig. 4a–d),
again showing that pap did not reverse apo-induced ppi
deficits. anova of startle magnitude on p-alone trials
revealed no significant main effects of apo dose (f<1),
or pap dose (f<1), and no apo × pap interaction (f<1;
fig. 4e).
papaverine vs. d-amphetamine (ppi protocol 2)
studies testing for pap (30 mg/kg) effects on measures of
amph (4 mg/kg)-induced ppi deficits in sd rats were
prompted by the lack of effects of pap on measures of
apo-induced ppi deficits (figs. 2, 3, and 4), yet significant
effects of pap in measures of amph-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 6a,b). anova of %ppi revealed main
effects of amph dose (f=35.27, df 1, 16, p<0.0001) and
pap (f = 12.65, df1,16, p< 0.005), and no significant
amph × pap interaction effect (f=1.47, df1,16, ns,

and startle magnitude (inset) in sd rats. pretreatment time for pap
relative to amph treatment was 5 min, and the experiment was begun
10 min after amph treatment. anova revealed a significant main
effect of amph (p<0.0001, not indicated in figure) and pap (p<
0.005). pap did not reverse ppi deficits induced by 4 mg/kg amph.

revealed a significant effect of pap (f=7.62, df 1, 16,
p<0.02), but not of amph dose (f<1), and no amph ×
pap interaction effect (f<1; fig. 5 inset).
in these rats, pap significantly increased ppi and
reduced startle magnitude. to evaluate if the main effect
of pap on startle magnitude may have affected pap effects
on ppi, matched subgroups of rats were created as
described above (experiment 1.2.2; pulse alone amplitude
(mean ± sem): vehicle/vehicle treatment (92±16), pap/
vehicle treatment (95±27); vehicle/amph (112±35), pap/
amph (110±37)). in these subsets of rats (n=4/pap
group), %ppi (mean ± sem) was: vehicle/vehicle treatment
(79±1), pap/vehicle treatment (83±4); vehicle/amph (47
±2), pap/amph (52±6). this indicates that when pap
effects on startle were minimized, pap effects on ppi were
strongly reduced, and more importantly, there remained no
evidence for an amph × pap interaction effect on %ppi
(f<1).

hyperlocomotion in sd vs. wi rats

to assess the bioavailability/bioactivity of pap in both rat
strains and to evaluate the effects of pap in another
measure with predictive validity for antipsychotics, the
effects of pap were tested in a paradigm of amph-induced
hyperlocomotion. anova of pre-drug activity revealed a
significant effect of time (p<0.0001) and strain × time
interaction (p < 0.005). no main effect of strain was
detected, and no main effect of dose group (i.e., the dose

and the beginning of the experiment was 5 min. anova of pre-drug
activity revealed similar beam break activity of dose groups (i.e., the
dose assigned, but not yet given). after amph, anova of beam
break activity for the 2-h post-injection period revealed main effects of
strain (p<0.02) and time (p<0.0001), and interactions of strain × time
(p<0.0001) and pap × time (p<0.0001). analyses revealed suppression of locomotion by pap relative to vehicle for the first and second
post-injection interval, and a trend towards an effect in the third
interval in sd rats, but not in wi rats. asterisk symbols denote
significance levels of post hoc comparisons between vehicle and paptreated rats (n=8 sd rats and n=7 wi rats). c pretreatment time for
pap relative to the start of the experiment was 5 min. anova of

significant main effects of pap (p<0.0001) and time (p<0.002), and a
significant interaction of pap × time (p<0.0001; n=11 sd rats/pap

locomotion by pap for the first 5 time intervals, whereas the later time
intervals did not reach the bonferroni-adjusted alpha-level. asterisk

locomotor activity during the first 2-h post-injection period
revealed significant main effects of strain (f=9.83, df 1, 13,
p<0.01) and time (f=54.35, df 11, 143, p<0.0001), a
significant interaction of pap × time (f=9.35, df 11, 143,

spontaneous locomotion
tests for pap effects on measures of spontaneous locomotion
were conducted in sd rats to assess if a non-specific
suppression of locomotion contributes to the ability of pap
to oppose amph-induced hyperactivity.
anova of the first 2-h post-injection period revealed
significant main effects of pap (f=40.06, df 1, 20, p<
0.0001) and time (f=2.83, df 11, 220, p<0.002), and a
significant interaction of pap × time (f=25.64, df 11, 220,
p < 0.0001). visual inspection of the locomotor data
suggested that the locomotor-suppressing pap effects might
last for up to ∼1 h post-injection. post hoc tests were carried
out for these six 10-min intervals using bonferroni-adjusted
significance levels (alpha=0.008). post hoc analysis revealed
significant suppression of spontaneous locomotor activity
by pap for the first 50 min (p<0.0001 for intervals 1 to 4,
p<0.005 for interval 5), whereas the interval thereafter
failed to reach the bonferroni-adjusted level of significance.
taken together, the data suggest that pap suppresses
spontaneous locomotion in sd rats for at least 50 min
(see fig. 6c).
fig. 7 effects of papaverine on apomorphine-induced hypothermia in
sd rats. pretreatment time for pap relative to apo treatment was
5 min, and the final temperature recording was taken 8 min thereafter.
anova of the change in t° (t°post-injection − t°baseline) revealed main
effects for pap (p<0.0001) and apo (p<0.001), and a significant
pap × apo interaction (p<0.001). pap pretreatment did not reverse
apo-induced t° reductions, but tended to further decrease t° when
compared to vehicle treatment in apo-treated rats. asterisk symbols
denote significance levels of post hoc comparisons (***p<0.005,
***p<0.0005; n=7–8 sd rats/pap dose group)

induced hyperlocomotion data (fig. 6a,b) suggested that the
pap effects lasted for 20–30 min post-injection in sd rats
and potentially for 20 min in wi rats. separate post hoc
tests for the two strains and these three 10-min intervals
were conducted using alpha-levels that were bonferroniadjusted for the 3 time intervals analyzed (p=0.016). these
tests revealed significant suppression of amph-induced
hyperlocomotion by pap when compared to vehicle for the
first (p<0.0001), and second post-injection interval (p<
0.005), whereas the pap effect failed to reach significance
in the third interval (p=0.088) post-injection in sd rats. in
wi rats, a trend towards a pap effect was detected in the
first interval post-injection (p=0.071), but not the second
and third interval post-injection (both ns). taken together,
the data suggest that pap is able to oppose the hyperactivity induced by amph in sd rats for 20–30 min after
amph treatment, corresponding to 25–35 min after pap
treatment; these effects appear less pronounced and of
shorter duration in wi rats (see fig. 6a,b).

core body temperature: papaverine vs. apomorphine
anova of t° prior to injection revealed no significant
differences for apo or pap dose groups (both main effects
and the apo × pap interaction ns) confirming similar
baseline values. subsequent anova of the change in t°
(t°post-injection − t°baseline) revealed significant main effects
for pap (f=34, 99, df 1, 13, p<0.0001) and apo (f=19,
58, df 1, 13, p<0.001), and a significant pap × apo
interaction (f=20, 45, df 1, 13, p<0.001). post hoc tests
revealed that t° was significantly reduced in vehicle/apotreated rats when compared to vehicle/vehicle-treated rats
(p<0.001). this confirms the sensitivity of the t° assay to
detect drug-induced reductions in t°. importantly, t° was
also reduced in pap/vehicle-treated rats when compared to
vehicle/vehicle-treated animals (p<0.001). this confirms
the bioavailability/bioactivity of pap in sd rats. pretreatment with pap did not reverse apo-induced reductions on
t°; in fact, t° tended to be further decreased after pap/apo
treatment when compared to vehicle/apo treatment
(p=0.099; fig. 7).

discussion
here we report that the preferential  xxxg1690xxx  inhibitor pap
does not reverse da agonist-induced ppi deficits regardless
of (1) pap dose (3–30 mg/kg), (2) pretreatment time for
pap relative to apo and the beginning of the recording (5
vs. 30 min), (3) prepulse intervals (10 to 120 ms), (4) rat

psychopharmacology (2009) 203:723–735

strain (sd vs. wi rats), and (5) whether da receptor
stimulation was direct (apo) or indirect (amph). the
sensitivity of the apo/ppi paradigm to a comparison
antipsychotic (haloperidol) was confirmed, in line with
previous studies showing that haloperidol prevents da
agonist-induced ppi deficits under a wide range of
experimental conditions (c.f. geyer et al. 2001; swerdlow
et al. 2004, 2005; c.f. swerdlow et al. 2008).
negative findings must be viewed with caution, as they
might reflect a number of factors impacting the sensitivity
of detecting pap effects, including an absence of pap
bioavailability and bioactivity. however, bioavailability and
bioactivity of pap during this time interval was confirmed
in three independent behavioral measures: core body
temperature, amph-induced hyperactivity, and locomotor
activity.
consistent with previous findings, apo led to significant
decreases in t° (varty and higgins 1998). pap treatment
also induced marked hypothermia, consistent with a previous
report (wachtel 1982). pap did not reverse apo-induced
hypothermia; in fact, treatment with pap and apo tended to
lower t°, relative to the vehicle/apo treatment condition.
arguably, while potential d2-like antagonistic effects of pap
in the cns in this assay are likely to be masked by (nondopaminergic) hypothermia-inducing effects of pap on the
peripheral vasculature, at the very least, these data provide
further evidence of the bioavailability/bioactivity of pap at a
time point corresponding to the middle of ppi sessions
(pretreatment time for pap, 5 min).
bioavailability and bioactivity of pap was further
confirmed by (1) the suppression of amph-induced
hyperlocomotion and (2) the suppression of spontaneous
locomotion by pap treatment. both findings are consistent
with previous studies (siuciak et al. 2006). in sd rats,
inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity was present
for at least 50 min, i.e., throughout and beyond the time
window in which pap reversed amph-induced hyperlocomotion (20–30 min). thus, while the suppression of
amph-induced hyperlocomotion may—in principle—
suggest an antipsychotic-like profile of pap, it is questionable if these effects indicate a “true antipsychotic-like
profile”, or merely reflect a suppression of spontaneous
locomotion that is uncovered under conditions of high
activity. this view is supported by comprehensive data
from siuciak et al. (2006) showing that the 95% confidence
band for the id50 of pap on the suppression of spontaneous
locomotion fully included the corresponding confidence
band for amph-induced hyperlocomotion. data from the
same study further indicate that the same case can be made
for pap effects in models of car and possibly nmdaantagonist-induced hyperlocomotion (siuciak et al. 2006).
because the main goal of this study was to assess pap
effects in the ppi model, comprehensive dose–response

733

functions were not completed with locomotor studies. such
dose–response analyses might have enabled us to assess a
“therapeutic index” for pap, based on doses of pap that
suppressed amph hyperlocomotion, but not spontaneous
locomotor activity. the dissociation between antipsychotic
effects on generalized motor activity vs. activation associated
with psychostimulants or motivational states has been a
longstanding challenge that has been addressed via a number
of creative experimental strategies (e.g., see, siuciak et al.
2006).
negative findings might also reflect the insensitivity of
one particular set of ppi parameters to detecting pap
effects. thus, we assessed the effects of pap in measures of
ppi in detail and under a wide range of experimental
conditions, none of which suggested an antipsychotic-like
profile of pap in ppi measures. we cannot exclude the
possibility that an antipsychotic-like profile might become
evident at higher pap doses, repeated or chronic pap
treatment, or under other experimental conditions. the
conditions tested in the present study have been used in our
laboratory and those of others to correctly detect antipsychotic potential for a large number of clinically effective
antipsychotics that differ in both clinical properties and
mechanisms of action (for reviews, see geyer et al. 2001 and
swerdlow et al. 2008). it is also possible that antipsychotic
profiles in these measures might be detected using other pde
inhibitors, particularly those active against members of the
pde4 subgroup (kanes et al. 2007; siuciak et al. 2008). the
present studies also do not address whether inhibition of
 xxxg1690xxx  is able to reverse nmda-antagonist-induced ppi
deficits in rats; such an effect in mice has been controversial
(lu et al. 2007; schmidt et al. 2008).
at present, it is difficult to account for the differences
between our findings and those presented in abstract form
by bleickardt et al. (2007). a full understanding of pap
effects on ppi requires analyses of—or controls for—
drug-induced changes in startle magnitude, and we must
await a full publication of the data from bleickardt et al.
(2007) for this type of detailed information. however, a
novel study by nishi et al. (2008) suggests that high da d2
tone might obviate the effects of pap in some in vivo
measures. using microdialysis, nishi et al. (2008) reported
that pap-induced increases of camp/pka levels in the
striatum were only observed when d2 tone was reduced via
co-treatment with a subthreshold dose of the d2 antagonist,
haloperidol. similarly, siuciak et al. (2006) observed papinduced catalepsy only when pap treatment was combined
with a subthreshold dose of haloperidol. it is thus possible
that pap effects on ppi might be most easily detected under
conditions of low basal d2 tone. while we have tested pap
in several rat strains and under conditions of both strong
ppi disruption mediated by high doses of da agonists
(figs. 2, 3a, and 4) as well as small/moderate ppi disruption

734

mediated by low doses of da agonists (figs. 3b and 5), we
cannot exclude the possibility that pap effects on ppi
might have been detected under experimental conditions
characterized by low d2 tone. importantly, the present
study was conducted under conditions most commonly
used in the ppi predictive model of antipsychotic effects
(swerdlow et al. 1994).
as documented in large, prospective clinical trials such
as the catie study (lieberman et al. 2005), there is a clear
need for the development of antipsychotics that differ
fundamentally from existing first- and second-generation
compounds. major advances in our understanding of postreceptor signal transduction mechanisms have identified a
number of potentially novel targets for drug action that
might have the ability to regulate “downstream” effects of
dopamine and/or glutamate neurotransmission. it is conceivable that, in order to detect compounds with fundamentally different mechanisms of antipsychotic action (e.g.,
pro-cognitive effects), we will need fundamentally different
predictive models. one such model may be attentional setshifting in rodents, a task that mimics some fronto-cortical
attentional deficits that can be observed in patients with
schizophrenia. indeed, rodefer et al. (2005) have shown
that extradimensional attentional set-shifting remains
disrupted after a washout period following subchronic
treatment with pcp, and this deficit was reversed by acute
treatment with pap. on the other hand, many of the
challenges of developing drugs aimed at these novel targets
are similar to those faced in the development of conventional antipsychotics, e.g., dose and strain sensitivity,
pharmacokinetics and dynamics, behavioral specificity,
target specificity, and regional distribution. to the degree
that we could address these challenges in the present study,
we conclude that one sensitive predictive model—the
blockade of ppi-disruptive effects of da agonists—fails
to detect antipsychotic-like properties of pap and that
antipsychotic-like properties detected with locomotor-based
assays may need to be treated with caution due to
concurrent inhibition of spontaneous locomotion.
