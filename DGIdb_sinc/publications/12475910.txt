abstract
chronic exposures to inorganic arsenic (ias) have been linked to increased incidences of various
cancers, including cancer of the urinary bladder. mechanisms by which ias promotes cancer
may include stimulation of  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1) dna binding through increased
expression and/or phosphorylation of the ap-1 constituents. however, the role of methylated
metabolites of ias in ap-1 activation has not been thoroughly examined. in this study, we show
that short-time exposures to 0.1-5 µm arsenite (iasiii) or the methylated trivalent arsenicals
methylarsine oxide (masiiio), or iododimethylarsine (dmasiiii) induce phosphorylation of  xxxg1222xxx  and increase ap-1 dna binding activity in human bladder epithelial cells. dmasiiii and
especially masiiio are considerably more potent than iasiii as inducers of c-jun phosphorylation
and ap-1 activation. phosphorylated c-jun, junb, jund, and  xxxg811xxx , but not c-fos, fosb, or atf2, are detected in the ap-1-dna binding complex in cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals. in
cells transiently transfected with an ap-1-dependent promoter-reporter construct, masiiio was
more potent than iasiii in inducing the ap-1-dependent gene transcription. exposures to trivalent
arsenicals induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), but not c-jun
n-terminal kinases or p38 kinases. these results indicate that an erk-dependent signal
transduction pathway is at least partially responsible for c-jun phosphorylation and ap-1
activation in urotsa cells exposed to inorganic or methylated trivalent arsenicals.

pidemiological evidence demonstrates that inorganic arsenic (ias) is a potent human
carcinogen (1). chronic exposures to ias are associated with increased prevalence of skin
cancer and cancers of internal organs, including lung, liver, kidney, and bladder (2, 3). in
populations worldwide, drinking water contaminated with arsenite (iasiii) or arsenate (iasv) is
the major source of exposure to ias (4). the mechanisms by which ias induces cancer have not
been thoroughly characterized. elucidation of these mechanisms in laboratory studies has been
hindered by the lack of an adequate animal model. therefore, many ex vivo mechanistic studies

have been carried out with cultured human cells, including cells derived from tissues that are
targets for carcinogenic effects of ias. these studies suggest that ias is not a classic genotoxin
or mutagen but rather may act as a cocarcinogen in combination with a genotoxic agent (5). in
addition, ias modifies signal transduction pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell
growth and proliferation (6). it has been shown that iasiii modulates the expression and/or dna
binding activities of several transcription factors associated with cell proliferation and death,
including nuclear factor-kappab ( xxxg1559xxx ) (7, 8), tumor suppressor 53 (p53) (9), a gc-box specific
transcription factor sp1 (10), a y-box specific transcription factor-1 (yb-1) (10), and activator
protein-1 (ap-1) (11-13). examination of mechanisms involved in the ap-1 activation indicates
that iasiii stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade, thus inducing
expression of c-jun and c-fos protooncogenes and enhancing dna binding activity of ap-1 (12,
14-17). the modulation of ap-1-dependent gene transcription by iasiii may contribute to the
induction of proliferation in cells exposed to this arsenical (13, 17).
most studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in arsenic carcinogenesis have focused on
ias species, particularly iasiii, and little attention has been given to methylated arsenicals, which
are metabolites of ias. in humans and many other mammalian species, ias is metabolized to
methylarsenic species (mas) and dimethylarsenic species (dmas) (18-20). the metabolic
pathway for ias includes both reduction and oxidative methylation steps, during which arsenic
cycles between +5 and +3 oxidation states (21, 22). thus, both pentavalent and trivalent
arsenicals are intermediates or products in this pathway: iasv → iasiii → masv → masiii →
dmasv → dmasiii. iasiii has commonly been considered the most toxic metabolite in this
pathway, and the term biomethylation used to indicate a mechanism for the detoxification of ias.
however, recent studies show that methylated trivalent arsenicals, methylarsonous acid (masiii)
and dimethylarsinous acid (dmasiii) are, unlike their pentavalent counterparts, methylarsonic
acid (masv) and  xxxd402xxx  (dmasv), potent cytotoxins (23-25) and enzyme
inhibitors (26-28). furthermore, masiii and dmasiii, but not iasiii or iasv, directly damage
dna in an in vitro system or in intact cells (29). thus, production of these methylated species
that contain asiii should properly be regarded as a process for activation of ias as a toxin and a
carcinogen. because both masiii and dmaiii have been detected in urine of individuals
chronically exposed to ias from drinking water (30-34), it is likely that these highly toxic and
potentially genotoxic species are significant and persistent products of ias metabolism in
humans.
to characterize the role of arsenic metabolites in the activation of ap-1-dependent gene
transcription, we have examined composition and dna binding activity of ap-1 in urotsa, a
human urinary bladder epithelial cell line, exposed to inorganic or methylated arsenicals that
contain trivalent or pentavalent arsenic. we found that short-time exposures to micromolar
concentrations of inorganic or methylated trivalent arsenicals significantly increased the nuclear
level of phospho-c-jun (p-c-jun) and the dna binding activity of ap-1. notably, methylated
trivalent arsenicals are considerably more potent inducers of c-jun phosphorylation and
activators of ap-1 dna binding than is iasiii. analysis of mapk activation patterns suggests
that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks), but not c- xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) or p38
kinases, are responsible for c-jun phosphorylation and ap-1 activation in exposed cells. hence,
masiii and dmasiii, methylated trivalent metabolites produced during ias metabolism, likely

contribute to the activation of ap-1 and to the induction of the ap-1-regulated gene
transcription.
materials and methods
arsenic compounds
iasv and iasiii (sodium salts, at least 99% pure) were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis,
mo). masv (sodium salt, 98% pure) was obtained from chem service (west chester, pa) and
dmasv (98% pure), from strem (newburyport, ma). the methylated trivalent arsenicals
methylarsine oxide (masiiio) and iododimethylarsine (dmasiiii) were synthesized by dr.
william r. cullen (university of british columbia, vancouver, canada) by using previously
described methods (21, 26). the identity and purity of the synthesized arsenicals were confirmed
with 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. analyses by hydride generation
atomic absorption spectrophotometry performed in this laboratory found small amounts
(approximately 2%) of ias in each of these compounds. in aqueous solutions, masiiio and
dmasiiii are presumed to form corresponding acids, masiii and dmasiii, respectively (22).
73
radiolabeled [ as]iasv was purchased from los alamos meson production facility (los
73
73
alamos, nm). [ as]iasiii was prepared from [ as]iasv by reduction with
73
metabisulfite/thiosulfate reagent (35). yield of [ as]iasiii in this reaction as determined by thinlayer chromatography (36) typically exceeded 95%.
cell cultures and treatment
urotsa, an sv40-immortalized cell line derived from normal human urothelium (37, 38), was
obtained from dr. nyseo unimye (west virginia university, morgantown, wv). the urotsa
cells were maintained in eagle’s minimum essential medium (mem; gibco brl, grand
island, ny) containing 2 mm glutamine (sigma), 10% fbs (gibco), 1 mm sodium pyruvate
(gibco), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (gibco), 1.5 µg/ml sodium bicarbonate (gibco),
50 u/ml penicillin (sigma), and 50 µg/ml streptomycin (sigma). for analyses of mapks, cells
were serum starved (1% of fbs) for 16 h before exposure to arsenicals. cells were cultured in
60- or 100-mm-diameter culture dishes (falcon, becton dickinson labware, lincoln park, nj)
at 37oc in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2. urotsa cells
rapidly proliferate under these conditions with a doubling time of less than 24 h. stock solutions
of iasv, iasiii, masv, masiiio, and dmasv (100 mm) were prepared in sterile pbs (gibco).
stock solutions of dmasiiii (100 mm) were prepared in 95% ethanol. to prevent oxidation of
trivalent arsenicals, all stock solutions were prepared immediately before each experiment and
kept on ice. stock solutions of arsenicals were diluted with sterile pbs. for short-time
exposures, cells were treated with trivalent arsenicals (0.1-5 µm) or with pentavalent arsenicals
(1-200 µm) for up to 2 h. in addition, 24-h exposures were performed to examine effects of
arsenicals on cell viability and proliferation. cell cultures at 70-80% confluency were used in
most experiments. however, for the cell proliferation assay, 33-40% confluent cultures were
used to permit cell growth. in some experiments, hela cells (american type culture collection,
manassas, va) cultured in mem with 10% fbs and treated for 2 h with o-tetradecanoylphorbol
13-acetate (tpa, 25 ng/ml; sigma) were used as positive controls. to examine ias metabolism,
73
80% confluent cells cultured in 12-well plates were exposed to [ as]iasiii (0.1 µm) for 48 h.

radiolabeled metabolites were analyzed in both cells and media by thin-layer chromatography
(36).
cell viability and proliferation assays
effects of arsenicals on cell viability were examined by using the mtt (thiazolyl blue) assay
(39). this assay monitors conversion of mtt to insoluble purple formazan in a reaction
catalyzed by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. for the mtt assay, cell culture
medium was removed, cells were washed with pbs, and the corresponding phenol red-free
medium was added. mtt (sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and cells
were incubated at 37oc for 3 h. after incubation, medium was removed and cells were washed
with pbs. the insoluble formazan was then dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (sigma).
absorbance of the dye was measured at 570 nm with background subtraction at 630 nm. the
effects of arsenicals on cell proliferation were measured by quantitating the incorporation of
[3h]thymidine (perkinelmer life sciences, boston, ma; 0.2 µci/well) into newly synthesized
dna.
cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts
for harvesting, cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold pbs containing 1 mm
dithiothreitol (dtt; sigma) and the protease inhibitors 2.5 µg/ml aprotinin (sigma), 1 µg/ml
leupeptin (sigma), 1 µg/ml pepstatin a (sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(pmsf; sigma). cells were lysed on ice with 250 µl of cold cytoplasmic extraction buffer (40)
containing protease inhibitors (as above) and transferred into test tubes. after a 10-min
incubation on ice, 2.5 µl of 10% nonidet p-40 (sigma) was added to each tube, and samples
were vortexed. soluble cytoplasmic extracts were separated from cell lysates by centrifugation at
12,000g for 5 min at 4°c. nuclear fractions were washed gently with the cytoplasmic extraction
buffer (200 µl/sample) without nonidet p-40 and centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min (4°c). each
washed nuclear fraction was then treated with 75 µl of cold nuclear extraction buffer (40)
containing protease inhibitors (as above). the nuclear extracts were maintained on ice for 1 h
with occasional vortexing. finally, nuclear protein extracts were clarified by centrifugation at
12,000g for 5 min (4°c) and stored at −80°c until analyzed.
for mapk analyses, cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in 20 mm hepes (ph 7.4) buffer
containing 50 mm beta-glycerolphosphate (sigma), 1% triton x-100 (sigma), 10% glycerol
(gibco), 2 mm egta (sigma), 1 mm dtt, 10 mm naf (sigma), 1 mm na3vo4 (sigma), 0.5
µm okadaic acid (sigma), 1 mm pmsf, and, each at 2 µm, aprotinin, pepstatin a, and
leupeptin. cell lysates were passed through a 22-gauge needle and vortexed for 1 min at 4°c.
cells debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min at 4°c. the bicinchoninic acid
microassay kit (sigma) was used to determine protein concentrations in final extracts. equal
amounts of protein were used for immunoblot analysis.
immunoblot analysis
nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins (20 µg each) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% or 12% gel slabs. separated proteins were

electroblotted on pvdf membranes and blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in pbs (bio-rad,
hercules, ca). the membranes were washed with pbs containing 0.1% tween 20 and probed
(1:5000) with rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to c-jun  xxxg1222xxx  (sc-44; santa cruz biotechnology,
santa cruz, ca), c-fos p62 (sc-52; santa cruz biotechnology), and  xxxg811xxx  (sc-605x; santa cruz
biotechnology). phosphorylated c-jun (p-c-jun) was detected by using mouse monoclonal
antibody (sc-822; santa cruz biotechnology). enzymes of the mapk family, jnks 1 and 2
( xxxg1370xxx ,2), p38, and erks 1 and 2 ( xxxg1369xxx ,2), were analyzed by using rabbit polyclonal
antibodies from cell signaling technology (neb, beverly, ma). mouse monoclonal antibodies
from this supplier were used to detect phosphorylated forms of these kinases (p- xxxg1370xxx ,2, p-p38,
and p- xxxg1369xxx ,2). antigen-antibody complexes were stained with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:2000; santa cruz biotechnology) and
treated with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent, super signal west pico
chemiluminescent substrate (pierce, rockford, il). immunoblot images were digitized, and the
optical densities of specific antigen-antibody complexes were quantified by using the gene
gnome imaging system supported with the gene tools software package (both from syngene,
frederick, md).
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa)
the 5'-ends of double-stranded oligonucleotides that contain an ap-1 consensus sequence (5'tgagtcag-3', promega, madison, wi) were labeled with [gamma-32p]atp (amersham pharmacia
biotech, piscataway, nj), using 15 u of t4 polynucleotide kinase (new england biolabs,
northampton, ma) at 37°c for 30 min. dna-protein binding reactions were performed at room
temperature for 10 min in reaction mixtures containing 6 µg of nuclear proteins, 2 µg of poly(didc) ⋅ poly(di-dc) (boehringer ingelheim, baltimore, md), approximately 1 ng (2 × 106 cpm) of
radiolabeled probe, and buffer (10 mm tris-hcl, 50 mm nacl, 2 mm edta, 5% glycerol, and
1 mm dtt, ph 7.9). for supershift analyses, antibodies specific for the ap-1 constituents were
added to the reaction mixture (2 µg/assay). antibodies from two manufacturers were used,
including rabbit polyclonal antibodies against c-jun, c-fos,  xxxg811xxx , atf-2, and mouse
monoclonal antibodies against p-c-jun and p-atf-2 (all from santa cruz biotechnology), and
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human c-jun, junb, jund, c-fos, and fosb supplied in the
nushift kit (geneka biotechnology, montreal, canada). a nuclear protein extract from 3t3 sr
(serum-responsive mouse embryo) cells (nushift kit, geneka biotechnology) served as a
positive control for the supershift analysis. a neutralizing c-fos peptide (nushift kit, geneka
biotechnology) was used in the assay to confirm the specificity of antibodies against c-fos. a
50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant ap-1 probe was used to establish the binding
specificity. the whole dna-protein binding reaction mixtures were separated in 4%
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in a high ionic strength running buffer (25 mm tris, 190 mm
glycine, 1 mm edta, ph 8.5). gels were dried at 80°c for 1 h and analyzed by a
phosphorimager (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca).
promoter-reporter constructs, transient transfection, and promoter-reporter assay
two promoter-reporter constructs were used in this study: pap-1-luc (stratagene, san diego,
ca) that is composed of a sevenfold tandem repeat of the ap-1 response element cloned
upstream of a tata box and firefly luciferase cdna, and an sv-40 promoter-beta-galactosidase

construct, psv-beta-gal (promega). the activity of constitutively expressed beta-galactosidase was
used to normalize for plate-to-plate variations in transfection efficiency, cell number, and
viability. for transfection, cells were treated for 3 h with a mixture containing 1.0 µg of pap-1luc, 250 ng psv-beta-gal, and 2 µl of fugene 6 (roche molecular biochemicals, indianapolis, in)
in 2.5 ml opti-mem media (gibco). the transfection mixture was then replaced with fresh
complete medium for 24 h. transfected cells were treated with arsenicals for 8 h, after which
cells were washed twice with ice-cold pbs and lysed in 100 µl of lysis buffer (tropix, applied
biosystems, bedford, ma) with 0.5 mm dtt. cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at
14,000g for 2 min (4°c) and stored at −80°c. luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were
determined in 10-µl aliquots of cell lysates by using a dual-light kit (tropix). the
luminescence signals associated with the two enzyme activities were quantified by a tr717
microplate luminometer (tropix). the ap-1-dependent promoter activity was expressed as a
normalized luciferase activity (luciferase units/beta-galactosidase units).
statistical analysis
all experiments were replicated to ensure the reproducibility of results. representative findings
are shown. results of the cell viability, proliferation, and promoter-reporter assays were
evaluated by using a graphpad instat statistical software package (graphpad software, san
diego, ca). variations among means in a treatment group were analyzed by anova. each
treatment group included cells treated with various concentrations of an arsenical and control
(untreated) cells. the dunnett multiple comparison test was used to evaluate differences between
treated and control cells in treatment groups with statistically significant (p<0.05) variation
among means.
results
metabolism and toxicity of arsenicals in urotsa cells
before examination of dna binding activity and composition of ap-1 in urotsa cells, the
metabolic fate and toxicity of arsenicals in these cells were determined. in metabolic
experiments, urotsa cells exposed to 0.1 µm [73as]iasiii for up to 48 h produced no
radiolabeled methylated metabolite, indicating that this cell line does not methylate ias (data not
shown). cell viability and proliferation were examined in cell monolayers exposed to inorganic
and methylated trivalent arsenicals (0.1-5 µm) or to inorganic and methylated pentavalent
arsenicals (1-200 µm) for 2 or 24 h. exposures to iasiii or dmasiii and to low concentrations of
masiiio did not affect cell viability as measured by the mtt assay (fig. 1a, b). the rate of mtt
reduction was significantly decreased only in cells exposed to 5 µm masiiio. treatment with
pentavalent arsenicals did not affect cell viability (data not shown). the [3h]thymidine
incorporation assay was used to examine cell proliferation during 24-h exposures. no changes in
rates of cell proliferation were detected in cultures exposed to iasiii or to low concentrations of
masiiio or dmasiiio (fig. 1c). consistent with the results of the mtt assay, 5 µm masiiio
largely inhibited cell proliferation. treatment with 5 µm dmasiiii produced a similar, but less
pronounced, inhibitory effect on cell proliferation.

dna binding activity and composition of ap-1 in cells exposed to arsenicals
the dna binding of ap-1 was examined by emsa in cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals (0.15 µm) or pentavalent arsenicals (1 and 100 µm) for up to 2 h. no changes in ap-1 dna binding
activity were found in cells after exposures to pentavalent arsenicals (data not shown). trivalent
arsenicals exerted concentration- and time-dependent effects on dna binding of ap-1 in
urotsa cells. the ap-1 dna binding activity was suppressed in cells exposed for 1 h to 0.1 or
0.5 µm iasiii or dmasiiii but was strongly induced by 5 µm dmasiiii (fig. 2). the ap-1 dna
binding activity remained unchanged in cells during 1-h exposures to 1 or 5 µm iasiii but
increased slightly after 2-h exposures (data not shown). masiiio was a potent activator of ap-1
dna binding regardless of the exposure time. a 1-h exposure to masiiio activated ap-1 at
concentrations as low as 0.1 µm; the most notable effect occurred at 1 µm. the ap-1 dna
binding pattern in cells exposed to 5 µm masiiio resembled that in control (unexposed) cells.
the components of ap-1 complex in cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals and in control cells
were identified immunochemically by using the emsa supershift analysis. these experiments
used the concentrations of arsenicals that caused the most pronounced induction of ap-1 dna
binding activity (5 µm iasiii, 1 µm masiiio, and 5 µm dmasiiii). rabbit polyclonal antibodies
specific for c-fos and c-jun and mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for p-c-jun (all from
santa cruz) were initially used in this assay (fig. 3a). incubation of the dna-protein binding
mixture in the presence of antibodies against p-c-jun shifted almost entire ap-1-dna complex,
indicating that p-c-jun is a major constituent of the activated ap-1 dimer. the p-c-jun-related
supershifts were found in urotsa cells treated with trivalent arsenicals and also in untreated
(control) cells, which indicated that p-c-jun is present in ap-1 regardless of the treatment.
incubation of the assay mixtures in the presence of antibodies against c-jun resulted in
supershifts similar to those produced by antibodies against p-c-jun. in contrast, antibodies
against c-fos had little or no effect on electrophoretic mobility of the ap-1 complex in all
treatment groups, which suggested that under these conditions c-fos is not a significant
constituent. a nuclear protein extract from 3t3 sr cells served as a positive control for this
analysis. incubation of this extract in the dna-protein binding mixture that contained antibodies
against c-fos resulted in a distinct supershift, which indicated the presence of c-fos in the ap-1
complex. addition of a neutralizing peptide into the mixture completely prevented the
occurrence of the supershift, which confirmed the specificity of the c-fos antibodies. the
specificity of the dna binding assay for ap-1 was confirmed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled
wild-type or mutant ap-1 probe. to ensure accuracy of the emsa supershift data and to
examine participation of other ap-1 constituents in the ap-1-dna binding complex, additional
analyses were carried out with antibodies supplied from two independent sources, including
antibodies against c-jun, junb, jund, c-fos, and fosb (geneka biotechnology), and antibodies
against  xxxg811xxx , atf-2, and p-atf-2 (santa cruz biotechnology). here, the most notable
supershifts were observed in nuclear extracts incubated in the presence of antibodies against  xxxg1222xxx , jund, and especially  xxxg811xxx  (fig. 3b). because the c-jun antibody supplied by santa cruz
biotechnology is known to cross-react with junb and jund, the supershift data obtained with the
antibody from geneka biotechnology are likely to provide a more accurate estimate of the
presence of c-jun in the ap-1-dna binding complex. the geneka antibody is (according to the
manufacturer’s information) strictly specific for c-jun and does not cross-react with other
proteins of the jun family. notably, antibodies against junb caused a distinct supershift when

incubated with nuclear extracts from cells treated with masiiio. a similar, but less pronounced,
junb-related supershift was detected in other treatment groups. no supershifts were detected in
extracts incubated with antibodies against c-fos and fosb or against atf-2 and p-atf-2.
expression and activation of ap-1 constituents in cells exposed to arsenicals
the concentrations of ap-1 constituents were determined by immunoblot analysis in nuclear
protein extracts from cells treated with trivalent arsenicals and from control cells. this analysis
focused on p-c-jun and  xxxg811xxx , proteins identified by the emsa supershift assay as the major
components of the ap-1-dna binding complex. all trivalent arsenicals modified nuclear levels
of p-c-jun (fig. 4). treatments with low concentrations of iasiii (0.1 and 0.5 µm) decreased
nuclear p-c-jun levels. however, exposure to 1 or 5 µm iasiii increased p-c-jun levels in a
concentration-dependent manner. both methylated trivalent arsenicals, masiiio and dmasiiii,
were more potent inducers of nuclear p-c-jun than was iasiii. for all trivalent arsenicals,
maximal effects occurred after a 1-h exposure. a greater than 20-fold increase of p-c-jun was
found in cells exposed to 5 µm masiiio compared with 13-fold and 4-fold increases in cells
treated with 5 µm dmasiiii and 5 µm iasiii, respectively. notably, treatments with iasiii,
masiiio, or dmasiiii (0.1-5 µm) had no effect on nuclear levels of c-jun (fig. 4). effects of
pentavalent arsenicals on nuclear c-jun and p-c-jun in urotsa cells were also examined. no
changes were observed in cells exposed to iasv, masv, or dmasv (1, 10, or 100 µm) for 1 or 2
h (data not shown). the immunoblot analysis showed no increase in nuclear c-fos levels in
urotsa cells regardless of the treatment (fig. 5). nuclear c-fos levels were at or below the
detection limit of the method in either treated or untreated cells. to ensure the accuracy of c-fos
analysis by the immunoblot, nuclear extracts from 3t3 sr cells expressing c-fos and nuclear
extracts from hela cells treated with tpa (25 ng/ml, 2 h) were used as positive controls.
to localize c-fos, additional analyses were performed in cytoplasmic protein extracts from
exposed and control cells. unlike nuclear c-fos, cytoplasmic c-fos was detected by immunoblot
assay under all treatment conditions. the cytoplasmic c-fos levels were slightly increased in
cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals, particularly in cells exposed to masiiio. the immunoblot
analysis of  xxxg811xxx  in nuclear protein extracts from untreated cells showed a triplet of
immunoreactive protein bands in a 35- to 43-kda molecular mass range (fig. 6). exposures to
masiiio increased the intensity of all three bands and shifted the rapidly migrating
immunoreactive proteins to the slowly migrating 43-kda band of the triplet. dmasiiii was a less
potent inducer of  xxxg811xxx . no significant changes in the  xxxg811xxx  immunoblot profiles were detected
in cells exposed to iasiii.
induction of ap-1-dependent gene expression by trivalent arsenicals
to examine the effects of trivalent arsenicals on ap-1-dependent gene transcription in intact
cells, urotsa cells were transiently cotransfected with pap-1-luc, an ap-1-dependent promoterreporter construct containing cdna for firefly luciferase, and the constitutively active construct
psv-beta-gal. notably, the transfection efficiency did not exceed 1% under the given transfection
conditions. the luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were measured in cells treated with
arsenicals (1 or 5 µm) for 8 h and in untreated cells. the activity of constitutively expressed betagalactosidase was used to normalize well-to-well variations in transfection efficiency, cell

number, and viability. in transfected urotsa cells, treatment with only iasiii and masiiio, but
not dmasiiii, significantly increased the normalized ap-1-dependent luciferase activity (fig.
7a). notably, masiiio was a more potent inducer of the luciferase activity than was iasiii.
effects of trivalent arsenicals on enzymes of the mapk family
to identify upstream mechanisms responsible for c-jun phosphorylation and ap-1 activation by
trivalent arsenicals, protein extracts from control and exposed cells were analyzed for the
presence of the parent and activated (phosphorylated) forms of enzymes of the mapk family,
jnk, p38, and erk. no changes were detected in the concentrations of  xxxg1370xxx ,  xxxg1372xxx , and p38,
nor was induction of the corresponding phosphorylated forms (p- xxxg1370xxx , p- xxxg1372xxx , and p-p38)
seen, in cells treated with iasiii or dmasiiii (0.1 to 5 µm) for up to 2 h (data not shown).
similarly, exposures to masiiio, the most potent inducer of c-jun phosphorylation, did not alter
the immunoblot patterns for either jnk or p38 kinases (fig. 8). the protein extract from cells
exposed to a cytotoxic concentration of iasiii (400 µm) was used in these experiments as a
positive control for p- xxxg1370xxx , p- xxxg1372xxx , and p-p38 analyses. treatments with iasiii, masiiio, or
dmasiiii did not increase basal levels of  xxxg1369xxx  or  xxxg1366xxx . however, all three arsenicals induced
phosphorylation of  xxxg1366xxx . in cells treated with 5 µm iasiii, 1 µm masiiio, or 5 µm dmasiiii,
the p- xxxg1366xxx  levels peaked between 45 and 90 min of exposure and then decreased slightly (fig.
9). increased levels of p- xxxg1369xxx  were found in cells exposed to dmasiiii but not to iasiii or
masiiio (fig. 9c).
discussion
the role of ap-1 activation in arsenic carcinogenesis was previously examined in both in vitro
and in vivo models. most work has focused on effects induced in laboratory animals or cultured
cells by exposure to iasiii, the species commonly regarded as the most toxic and carcinogenic
among biologically relevant arsenicals. in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, 4 µm iasiii
has been shown to stimulate c-jun and c-fos transcription and activate ap-1 dna binding (11).
notably, treatments with submicromolar or micromolar concentrations of iasiii induced
production of growth-promoting cytokines and cell proliferation in these cells (11, 41). similar
effects of iasiii on cell proliferation and c-jun and c-fos transcription were found in a human
bladder epithelial cell line, urotsa (13). in these cells, short-time exposures to 5 µm iasiii
resulted in only a marginal increase in c-fos, but not in c-jun, mrna levels. greater increases in
both c-fos and c-jun mrna levels were found only after exposures to 50 µm iasiii. in addition,
ap-1 dna binding activity was increased in cells exposed to 50 µm but not to 5 µm iasiii (13).
in agreement with in vitro studies, increased ap-1 dna binding activity was also reported in
urinary bladder epithelium of mice chronically exposed to high concentrations of iasiii (5-100
mg/l) in drinking water (42). activating effects of iasiii on c-jun and c-fos expression or ap-1
dna binding have been confirmed in hela cells (12), human embryonic kidney (hek 293)
cells (43), human breast cancer (mda-mb-435) and rat hepatoma (h4iie) cells (10), and mouse
epidermal (cl 41) cells (16), and in precision-cut rat lung slices (44). the concentrations of iasiii
used in these studies ranged from 0.1 to 300 µm. notably, activation of c-jun and c-fos
expression or ap-1 dna binding has been observed almost exclusively at concentrations above
10 µm iasiii. the peak of activation has consistently occurred within 2 h of exposure. however,
these studies have not examined induction of c-jun phosphorylation by iasiii or by its

metabolites. the capacity of cells or tissues used in these studies to methylate ias has not been
evaluated. in sum, results of these earlier studies suggest c-jun and c-fos expression or ap-1
dna binding to be induced in cultured cells only by exposures to relatively high, potentially
cytotoxic, concentrations of iasiii. simeonova and co-workers (13) examined the effects of
methylated arsenicals, mas and dmas, on ap-1 activity in urotsa cells. both mas and dmas
(5 and 50 µm) induced ap-1 dna binding activity as measured by emsa but were less potent
than were iasiii. however, because these investigators did not specify the chemical composition
of mas and dmas used in their study, it is unclear whether these effects depended on the
oxidation state of arsenic in the test compounds.
recent information on adverse biological effects of methylated trivalent arsenicals as potent
enzyme inhibitors and cytotoxins (23-28) indicate that these metabolites of ias play significant
roles in the overall toxicity and carcinogenicity of this metalloid. the current study compared the
effects of inorganic and methylated trivalent or pentavalent arsenicals on ap-1 dna binding
activity and on expression of ap-1 constituents in urotsa cells. urotsa, an sv40-immortalized
cell line, was derived from normal human urothelium lining the ureter (37, 38). this cell line
does not display the characteristics of neoplastic transformation, as exemplified by lack of
colony formation in soft agar and growth of tumors in nude mice. urotsa cells do not express
arsenic methyltransferase (45) and do not methylate arsenicals (23, 25). thus, ias and mas
species added into the urotsa do not undergo oxidative methylation. all trivalent arsenicals
examined in this study, iasiii, masiiio, and dmasiiii, increased ap-1 dna binding activity in
urotsa cells. however, methylated trivalent arsenicals, especially masiiio, were much more
potent than iasiii as activators of ap-1. notably, low concentrations of iasiii and dmasiiii
suppressed the ap-1 dna binding. the emsa supershift analysis showed that p-c-jun was the
major constituent of the ap-1-dna binding complex in urotsa cells before or after the
exposure to arsenicals. in addition,  xxxg811xxx  and to a lesser extent jund, but not c-fos, fosb, or
atf-2, were present in the complex. junb was a significant component of the ap-1-dna
binding complex in cells exposed to masiiio but was only a minor component of the complex in
cells exposed to iasiii or dmasiiii and in untreated cells. thus, the increased presence of junb in
the ap-1 complex may be a specific marker of the exposure to masiii derivatives. given the
antagonistic roles of c-jun and junb in cell proliferation and transformation (46, 47), the
differential effects of masiiio on the ap-1 composition warrant further studies.
the immunoblot analyses of the major ap-1 constituents showed significant increases in p-c-jun
levels in nuclear extracts from urotsa cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals. similar to its effects
on ap-1 dna binding patterns, masiiio was also the most potent inducer of p-c-jun in this cell
line. in contrast, nuclear c-jun levels were unchanged, which suggests that a post-transcriptional
modification, phosphorylation, rather than de novo synthesis, was responsible for the increased
nuclear p-c-jun levels in exposed cells. thus, the phosphorylation of c-jun that is induced by
trivalent arsenicals at concentrations as low as 0.5-1 µm may be a more sensitive marker of the
exposure than is the induction of c-jun expression. compared with nuclear p-c-jun, a smaller
increase in nuclear  xxxg811xxx  was detected in cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals, particularly to
masiiio. a distinct electrophoretic shift from low to high molecular mass protein bands occurred
in  xxxg811xxx  protein fractions in exposed cells (fig. 6). a similar shift in fibroblasts exposed to tpa
was previously described by gruda and associates (48), who showed that this shift is associated
with an increased presence of the phosphorylated form of  xxxg811xxx  (p- xxxg811xxx ) in exposed cells. thus,

exposures to trivalent arsenicals induced  xxxg811xxx  phosphorylation in urotsa cells. taken together,
these data suggest that in urotsa cells the ap-1 dimers are composed mostly of the p-c-jun and
 xxxg811xxx  proteins, yielding p-c-jun/p-c-jun homodimers or p-c-jun/ xxxg811xxx  heterodimers. notably,
exposures to 0.1 or 0.5 µm masiiio that induced ap-1 dna binding activity did not increase
nuclear p-c-jun levels in urotsa cells. thus, mechanisms other than c-jun phosphorylation were
likely responsible for ap-1 activation by masiiio at low exposure levels.
in general, c-jun-containing ap-1 dimers have been associated with the induction of cell
proliferation (46, 47, 49, 50). here, we found that exposures to nontoxic concentrations of
trivalent arsenicals did not increase the 24-h cell proliferation rates in urotsa cells. because
urotsa is a very rapidly proliferating cell line, the pro-proliferative effects of arsenicals may be
too small to be detected on the background of the constitutively high proliferation rate over a
relatively short 24-h interval. in comparison, low concentrations of iasiii, masiiio, and dmasiiii
were previously found to induce cell proliferation in slowly proliferating normal human
epidermal keratinocytes (41).
the high potency of masiiio to activate ap-1 and to induce the ap-1 dna binding activity was
also demonstrated in urotsa cells transiently transfected with the pap-1-luc promoter-reporter
construct. here, 1 µm masiiio was a considerably more potent inducer of the ap-1-dependent
luciferase activity than was 1 µm iasiii. in contrast, 5 µm dmasiiii that activated ap-1 in the
parent cell line failed to induce luciferase activity in transfected cells. it should be noted that the
experiments in transfected urotsa cells were complicated by a low (≤1%) transfection
efficiency. we repeated these experiments using various transfection procedures without a
significant improvement. in a majority of these experiments, iasiii and masiiio induced the  xxxg1222xxx -dependent luciferase activity, but only one experiment showed significant activation by
dmasiiii. thus, data shown in fig. 7 represent an extensive series of experiments. notably,
preliminary studies carried out in the transiently transfected t24 (human bladder carcinoma) cell
line showed more consistent activation of ap-1-dependent luciferase activity by dmasiiii.
several studies have shown that activation of jnk and/or p38 is required for ap-1 activation in
cultured cells exposed to 40-300 µm iasiii (12, 16, 43). in our study, increased levels of p- xxxg1369xxx 
and/or p- xxxg1366xxx , but not p- xxxg1370xxx  and p- xxxg1372xxx  or p-p38, were detected in urotsa cells exposed to
much lower concentrations of trivalent arsenicals. the kinetic pattern of  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx 
phosphorylation in cells exposed to arsenicals resembles that of p-c-jun formation, which
suggests that  xxxg1369xxx  and/or  xxxg1366xxx  is directly involved in c-jun phosphorylation. although jnks
are regarded as the most specific and efficient enzymes involved in phosphorylation of c-jun
(47), other protein kinases, including abl tyrosine protein kinase (51) and erk (52, 53),
phosphorylate this transcription factor. for example, erk was involved in c-jun
phosphorylation and ap-1 activation in p53-deficient human lung cancer cells exposed to
 xxxd2298xxx  (54). notably, exposures to inorganic and methylated arsenicals are known to
induce oxidative stress in cultured cells (55, 56). it is possible that the activation of erk/p-c-jun
pathway in urotsa cells exposed to iasiii, masiiio, or dmasiiii is mediated by an increased
production of reactive oxygen species. activation of  xxxg1369xxx ,2 by trivalent arsenicals may also be
responsible for increased phosphorylation of  xxxg811xxx  that was detected in exposed cells as a shift in
the electrophoretic mobility of the  xxxg811xxx  protein fractions during the immunoblot analysis. the
transactivation of  xxxg811xxx  by erk has been reported by young and associates in jb6 cells (57). in

these cells, the erk-dependent transactivation of  xxxg811xxx  was a prerequisite for a mitogen-induced
activation of ap-1. activation of  xxxg1369xxx  and/or  xxxg1366xxx  by iasiii was previously described in
several types of animal and human cells (58, 59). notably, activation of  xxxg1369xxx ,2, but not jnk,
was required for iasiii-induced cell transformation (59). in our study, we showed that methylated
trivalent arsenicals were at least equipotent with iasiii as inducers of erk phosphorylation in
human urothelial cells. simeonova and associates (60) reported that activation of the epidermal
growth factor receptor provides the initial signal for erk phosphorylation in urotsa cells
exposed to iasiii. the upstream mechanisms as well as quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
erk activation by methylated trivalent arsenicals remain to be examined. preliminary studies
carried out in this laboratory showed that inhibition of mapk/erk kinase (mek) in urotsa
cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals completely blocks phosphorylation of erk 1 and  xxxg1366xxx  but
only partially suppresses p-c-jun levels (drobna et al., unpublished data). these data indicate
that although erk 1 and  xxxg1366xxx  are at least in part responsible for c-jun phosphorylation, other
protein kinases may be involved in this process.
in conclusion, exposures to trivalent arsenicals, iasiii, masiiio, or dmasiiii, increase ap-1
dna binding activity in urotsa cells through the erk-dependent induction of c-jun and
possibly  xxxg811xxx  phosphorylation (fig. 10). among these arsenicals, masiiio is the most potent
inducer of c-jun/ xxxg811xxx  phosphorylation and ap-1 activation, followed by dmasiiii and iasiii.
although this study does not provide an explanation for the greater potency of methylated
trivalent arsenicals as activators of ap-1, it is possible that methyl groups in masiiio and
dmasiiii facilitate interactions of these arsenicals with critical lipophilic moieties in cellular
receptors or in components of the signaling cascade that is responsible for c-jun/ap-1 activation
in urotsa cells. thus, methylated trivalent arsenicals that are chemically consistent with the
methylated metabolites of ias (masiii and dmasiii) are considerably more potent ap-1
activators than is the parent compound in cells derived from urinary bladder, one of the target
tissues for carcinogenesis in humans chronically exposed to ias. these findings support the
hypothesis that the biomethylation is a process that activates ias as a toxin and human
carcinogen. further studies of the downstream events associated with the ap-1 activation
induced by arsenic metabolites in human urinary bladder will elucidate the mechanisms by
which arsenicals produce their toxic and carcinogenic effects.

fig. 1

figure 1. effect of trivalent arsenicals on cell viability and proliferation in urotsa cultures exposed to iasiii (circle),
masiiio (square), or dmasiiii (triangle). cell viability was determined by the mtt assay after 2-h (a) and 24-h (b)
exposures; cell proliferation was measured by [3h]thymidine incorporation during a 24-h exposure (c). each symbol and
error bar represent a mean and sd for n = 4. *data significantly different from control (untreated cells) at p < 0.05.

fig. 2

figure 2. ap-1 dna binding activity in urotsa cells treated with trivalent arsenicals and in control (untreated) cells.

nuclear protein extracts from urotsa cells treated for 1 h with iasiii, masiiio, or dmasiiii and from control cells (6 µg of
protein each) were analyzed by emsa.

fig. 3

figure 3. emsa supershift analysis of nuclear protein extracts from urotsa cells treated for 1 h with 5 µm iasiii, 1 µm

masiiio, or 5 µm dmasiiii and from control (untreated) cells. for immunochemical characterization of the ap-1
constituents, the dna protein binding assay was carried out in the presence of antibodies specific for (a) p-c-jun, c-jun, or
c-fos (santa cruz biotechnology); and (b) c-jun, junb, jund, c-fos, or fosb (geneka biotechnology), and  xxxg811xxx , p-atf2, or atf-2 (santa cruz biotechnology). the specificity of the assay was established using a 50-fold excess of a wild-type
(wt) or mutated (mt) ap-1 probe. a nuclear protein extract from 3t3 sr cells served as a positive control for the analysis
of c-fos subunit. to confirm the specificity of the c-fos antibodies, the 3t3 sr nuclear extract was incubated in the dna
binding assay mixture in the presence of an excess of c-fos peptide.

figure 7. activation of ap-1 in transiently transfected urotsa cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals. cells were transiently
cotransfected with pap-1-luc and psv-beta-gal promoter-reporter constructs. luciferase and beta-galactosidase activities were
measured in cells treated with 1 or 5 µm iasiii or dmasiiii or 1 µm masiiio for 8 h and in untreated cells. the betagalactosidase activity was used to normalize for plate-to-plate variations in transfection efficiency, cell number, and
viability. relative units of the normalized luciferase activity are shown. each bar and error bar represent the mean and sd
for n = 3. *the ap-1 activation in treated cells is significantly different (p<0.05) from that in control (untreated) cells.

images (bar charts). the data in the bar charts are shown as the “fold” of erk activation over control.

fig. 10

figure 10. hypothetical signal transduction pathway for ap-1 activation in human bladder epithelial cells exposed to
trivalent arsenicals. this pathway includes induction of erk phosphorylation by trivalent arsenicals formed in the course
of ias metabolism and delivered to the cell via the bloodstream. the phosphorylation of erks likely occurs through a
cellular receptor (r)-mediated activation of mapk/erk kinase (mek). p-erks catalyze phosphorylation of  xxxg811xxx  and/or
c-jun, thus activating ap-1 dna binding in the nucleus. the activated ap-1, which is represented in the exposed cells
mainly by p-c-jun/p- xxxg811xxx  heterodimers or p-c-jun/p-c-jun homodimers, binds to the tpa-response element (tre) in the
promoter region, initiating the ap-1-dependent gene transcription.
