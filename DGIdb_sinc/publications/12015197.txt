abstract
the endogenous opioid system consists of three opioid peptide precursor genes encoding enkephalins (preproenkephalin, penk), dynorphins ( xxxg1722xxx ,  xxxg1722xxx ) and ␤-endorphin (␤end),  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) and three receptor genes encoding mu-opiod
receptor (mor), delta-opiod receptor (dor) and kappa-opiod receptor (kor). in the past years, all six genes have been inactivated in
mice by homologous recombination. the analysis of spontaneous behavior in mutant mice has demonstrated significant and distinct roles
of each gene in modulating locomotion, pain perception and emotional behaviors. the observation of opposing phenotypes of mor- and
dor-deficient mice in several behaviors highlights unexpected roles for dor to be further explored genetically and using more specific
delta compounds. the analysis of responses of mutant mice to exogenous opiates has definitely clarified the essential role of mor in
both morphine analgesia and addiction, and demonstrated that dor and kor remain promising targets for pain treatment. these studies
also show that prototypic dor agonists partially require mor for their biological activity and provide some support for the postulated
mu–delta interactions in vivo. finally, data confirm and define a role for several genes of the opioid system in responses to other drugs of
abuse, and the triple opioid receptor knockout mutant allows exploring non-classical opioid pharmacology. in summary, the study of null
mutant mice has extended our previous knowledge of the opioid system by identifying the molecular players in opioid pharmacology and
physiology. future studies should involve parallel behavioral analysis of mice lacking receptors and peptides and will benefit from more
sophisticated gene targeting approaches, including site-directed and anatomically-restricted mutations. © 2002 elsevier science ltd. all

1. introduction
opium has been used for thousands of years because it
produces euphoria and relieves pain. morphine was isolated from the poppy seed and is used in the clinic for the
treatment of severe pain, while heroin was synthesized by
morphine diacetylation and has become one of the most
addictive—and profitable—illegal drugs of abuse. it soon
became clear that opiates modify brain functions in ways
that can be useful when tightly controlled—or disastrous for
the long-run user. early efforts to understand the endogenous targets of opiate drugs provided receptor sites. binding
studies suggested three main classes of opioid receptors,
currently named mu, delta and kappa receptors. met- and
 xxxg1722xxx  were then isolated and characterized as the
first endogenous peptidic ligands for opioid receptors. their
discovery was soon followed by the identification of other
peptides, including ␤-endorphin (␤end) and dynorphins.
exogenous opiates therefore interact with an endogenous
neurotransmitter system, which is critically implicated in
the control of mood, motivation and pain.
the opioid system has been explored by the pharmacology for almost three decades. morphine derivatives, and
later agonists or antagonists with mu, delta or kappa selectivity, were used to show that the endogenous opioid system
regulates (i) nociceptive information, with overlapping contributions of mu, delta and kappa receptors, (ii) hedonic
homeostasis, mainly based on reinforcing properties of mu
and delta agonists and aversive activity of kappa compounds,
and (iii) stress responses with a main implication of mu
and delta receptors. the pharmacological exploration also
led to involve the opioid system in many other physiological responses, such as respiration, gastrointestinal motility,
endocrine and immune functions. a tremendous amount

of information has therefore accumulated (vaccarino and
kastin, 2000), indicating that the opioid system is complex,
and plays a central role in coping with threatening situations.
what are the components of the endogenous opioid system? molecular approaches have identified opioid peptide
precursor genes in the early 1980s, then genes encoding
the receptors a decade later. preproenkephalin (penk) and
 xxxg1722xxx  ( xxxg1722xxx ) genes encode several copies of
enkephalins and dynorphins, respectively. the  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) gene encodes ␤end, among other biologically active peptides. all these opioid peptides show the
canonical tyr-gly-gly-phe-met/leu n-terminal sequence,
indispensable to activate opioid receptors (akil et al.,
1997). more recently, distinct peptides named endomorphins have also been proposed as mu-selective endogenous
opioids (zadina et al., 1997). three genes encoding the
mu-opioid receptor (mor), delta-opioid receptor (dor)
and kappa-opioid receptor (kor) have been isolated and are
otherwise referred as to  xxxg1635xxx ,  xxxg1632xxx  and  xxxg1633xxx  using the
mouse genome nomenclature, or mop, dop and kop according to international union of pharmacology (iuphar).
the three genes are highly homologous at the level of
their predicted protein structure (kieffer, 1995), and their
genomic organization is almost identical (gavériaux-ruff
and kieffer, 1999), indicating that they probably evolved
from a common ancestor. opioid receptors belong to the g
protein-coupled receptor family, and form a four-member
gene subfamily together with the orphanin fq/nociceptin
receptor discovered later (darland et al., 1998).
homologous recombination technology has opened the
way to targeted gene mutagenesis in the early 1990s and
mutant mouse strains lacking genes of the opioid system
have been generated. these mice are extremely useful
tools and their analysis nicely complements and extends

pharmacological approaches. opioid receptor-deficient mice
allow now to accurately identify the molecular targets of
prototypic opioid agonists or antagonists currently used by
the pharmacologists. most importantly, the precise phenotyping of each mutant strain leads to revisit the implication
of each peptide and receptor in the many opioid-controlled
behaviors and to discover functions that have remained unexplored. initial data from mor-, kor-, dor-, penk- and
␤end-deficient mice have been reviewed earlier (hayward
and low, 1999; kieffer, 2000, 1999). at present, mice
lacking every component of the opioid system have been
generated, including  xxxg1722xxx -deficient mice and many more
aspects of opioid function have been explored in the knockout mice. studies have been performed in several mutants
for the same gene, or using mice mutated in distinct genes
of the opioid system in similar studies. opioid analgesia
has been extensively investigated, and more sophisticated
behaviors such as drug self-administration are being examined. here we will review all the available information
from the study of opioid peptide or receptor knockout mice,
in an attempt to highlight what the genetic approach has
added to our previous knowledge of the opioid system.
finally, the opioid system interacts with many other
neurotransmitter systems. many null mutant mice for
non-opioid genes have shown altered responses to morphine
and these data have been overviewed elsewhere (kieffer
and simonin, 2002).
2. the generation of mutant mice
2.1. single opioid receptor knockout mice
opioid receptor genes are organized similarly (gavériauxruff and kieffer, 1999) and their coding regions extend over
three exons encoding the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain i for exon 1, transmembrane domains
ii–iv for exon 2 and transmembrane domains v–vii followed by the cytoplasmic c-terminal region for exon 3. the
mor gene differs slightly in the 3 coding region, where
the last 12 codons are found on a fourth coding exon. distinct targeting vectors have been constructed for each mor,
dor and kor genes. mutated opioid receptor gene loci
produced by homologous recombination are presented in
fig. 1. pharmacological properties of these mutant mice are
reviewed in table 1.
several strains of mice lacking mu receptors have been
produced. five laboratories have reported the generation
of mor-deficient mice following deletion of exon 1 (sora
et al., 1997; tian et al., 1997; schuller et al., 1999), insertion of a neo cassette in exon 2 (matthes et al., 1996) or
deletion of both exons 2 and 3 (loh et al., 1998). in all the
homozygous mutant mice binding of [3 h] damgo, the
prototypic mu-selective agonist, was abolished (table 1)
demonstrating that  xxxg1635xxx  sites were deleted independently from the targeting strategy. further, the binding
of [3 h] endomorphin-2 was also absent in one of the

287

mutants (monory et al., 2000), confirming the absence
of  xxxg1635xxx  sites using another highly selective mu
compound. finally, agonist-induced g protein activation
was examined using the now widely used [35 s]guanosine
5 -3-o-(thio)triphosphate (gtp␥s) binding assay in several
mor mutants. there was no detectable [35 s]gtp␥s binding after stimulation of brain membranes or brain sections
by damgo, morphine and endomorphins (matthes et al.,
1998; mizoguchi et al., 1999; narita et al., 1999; monory
et al., 2000; park et al., 2000), definitely confirming the
absence of mu receptors in homozygous mutants.
the generation of mice deficient in delta receptors was reported by two groups (zhu et al., 1999; filliol et al., 2000).
homologous recombination led to exon 1- or exon 2-deleted
mice. in both cases, the binding of several radiolabelled delta
compounds was undetectable using either homogenate or autoradiographic binding, demonstrating the absence of delta
receptors. noticeably despite this absence of binding sites,
some analgesic activity of delta compounds was observed in
the mutant mice (zhu et al., 1999). the latter is likely due
to cross-reactivity of delta agonists at mu or other receptors
under in vivo experimental conditions, where agonist concentrations most probably exceed the nanomolar concentrations used in binding experiments (section 4.3). further, the
binding data showed that receptor sites for a delta-1 agonist (cyclic[d-penicillamine2 , d-penicillamine5 ]enkephalin,
dpdpe) or delta-2 agonists (deltorphins 1 and 2) are absent in homozygous animals deriving from both targeting
constructs (zhu et al., 1999; filliol et al., 2000). binding of
the general delta antagonist naltrindole was also suppressed
and together, these results demonstrate that the several delta
receptor binding sites postulated by the pharmacology (zaki
et al., 1996) arise from the dor gene.
only one group reported mice lacking kappa receptors
(simonin et al., 1998). targeting was directed to delete the
first coding exon. in these mice binding of the highly kappa
selective agonist [3 h] ci-977 was undetectable both by homogenate binding on brain membranes or autoradiographic
mapping (simonin et al., 1998). several kor subtypes have
been hypothesized (section 4.5) and these results demonstrate that the kor gene encodes the previously described
and main kappa1 receptor.
in conclusion, any gene disruption in the coding regions
of mor, dor and kor genes has led to undetectable binding of prototypic radiolabelled opioid ligands selective for
mu, delta and kappa sites, respectively. binding levels in heterozygous mutants, in all cases, were close to 50%, indicating that both alleles contribute to produce receptor proteins.
all the opioid receptor knockout mice were viable, fertile
and did not show overt anatomical deficit.
2.2. combinatorial opioid receptor knockout mice
multiple mutations can be produced by interbreeding
single homozygous mutant. mice lacking all three opioid
receptor genes have been obtained in a two-step strategy.

loh et al. (1998); swiss black hybrids for tian et al. (1997); 129/rej × c57bl/6 for schuller et al. (1999) and zhu et al. (1999).

breeding of mice lacking mor exon 2 (matthes et al.,
1996) with mice lacking kor exon 1 (simonin et al., 1998)
produced mor/kor double mutants, while breeding of
the former with exon 1 dor-deficient mice (filliol et al.,
2000) produced mor/dor double mutants. triple mutants
were obtained from mor/kor × mor/dor matings.
these animals showed no [3 h] damgo, [3 h] ci-977 and
[3 h] dpdpe binding sites, as expected from the parental
phenotypes (simonin et al., 2001).
2.3. opioid peptide knockout mice
mice lacking opioid peptide precursor genes have also
been produced and targeting strategies are shown in fig. 2.
pomc encodes several biologically active peptides. to
specifically delete ␤end, a stop codon was introduced in
exon 3 of the pomc gene (rubinstein et al., 1996). in

homozygous mutant mice, ␤-melanocyte stimulating hormone (msh) content and corticotropin (adrenocorticopin
hormone, acth) immunoreactivity were unchanged while
␤end was absent, confirming that the targeted mutagenesis
had successfully ablated the opioid peptide only. another
mutant mouse lacking the whole coding region of the
pomc gene was reported (yaswen et al., 1999). since
both opioid and non-opioid peptides, with distinct—and in
some instances opposing—activities are lacking, phenotypic
modifications in this mutant will not be discussed here.
two strains of knockout mice have been described for
the penk gene. in one mutant (könig et al., 1996) the
enkephalin-coding region (5 part of exon 3) was targeted,
leading to a truncated exon followed by an unexpected
partial duplication of exon 3. the gene knockout proved
successful since no enkephalin could be detected in the homozygous mutant. in the other mutant, the targeting strategy

and targeted genomes are indicated for ␤end (pomc gene, top), preproenkephalin (middle) and  xxxg1722xxx  (bottom). introns are indicated
by solid lines. exons are represented by boxes, with black boxes showing
coding regions and grey boxes the non-coding parts of the genes. the
neomycin-resistant cassette is indicated by a white box. a partial duplication of exon 3 occurred at the 3 end of neo in the penk mutant generated
by könig et al. (1996). targeting of the pomc gene by rubinstein et al.
(1996) was designed as to delete ␤end only, while other pomc-derived
peptides are intact. in original reports, mutant mice harvest the following genetic backgrounds: 129/sv × c57bl/6 for rubinstein et al. (1996),
zimmer et al. (2001); cd1 hybrids for könig et al. (1996); 129vev-tac
for sharifi et al. (2001); 129/rej × c57bl/6 for ragnauth et al. (2001).

produced a recombinant locus also lacking the 5 part of exon
3 (ragnauth et al., 2001). mice lacking the  xxxg1722xxx  gene were
obtained in two laboratories. deletion of the whole coding
region spanning exons 3 and 4 led to a loss of  xxxg1722xxx  mrna
in homozygous mutants (sharifi et al., 2001). another strategy consisted in deleting exon 3 and part of exon 4, which
produced mutant animals where dynorphin peptides were
absent (zimmer et al., 2001). together, using distinct targeting strategies, several research groups have obtained mice
lacking each gene encoding opioid peptides. as for receptor
knockout mice, heterozygous animals generally show half
the peptide content (␤end and penk). homozygous mutants
did not show obvious developmental defect, were able to reproduce and expanded at the expected mendelian frequency.
2.4. changes within the opioid system
although mice lacking opioid peptides or receptors have
been reported apparently normal, one could anticipate that
the absence of one component of the opioid system during
development would induce adaptive changes to maintain

homeostasis of the opioid system or activity of other functionally associated neurotransmitter systems. these modifications may be subtle and need to be explored to fully
characterize the mutant mice. an initial approach is to examine remaining partners of the opioid system. opioid peptides
and receptors show overlapping distributions (mansour and
watson, 1993), the three receptors are highly homologous
in structure (kieffer, 1995) and the multiple opioid peptides
arising from the pomc, penk and  xxxg1722xxx  genes bind to all
three receptors with high affinity and low selectivity (akil
et al., 1997). it is therefore possible that some redundancy
occurs among components of the opioid system, and that
the lack of one receptor or peptide could be compensated
for by increased activity of another member of the system.
the status of the opioid system in mutant mice has been
thoroughly examined and data are reviewed in table 1.
in mice lacking one opioid receptor, binding at the two
remaining receptors was first measured on whole brain
membranes. in mor-deficient mice several prototypic delta
ligands bound to mutant mice brains similarly to wild type
(matthes et al., 1996; sora et al., 1997; kitchen et al., 1997;
loh et al., 1998; schuller et al., 1999; chen et al., 2000).
also, binding of kappa1 agonists was maintained (matthes
et al., 1996; sora et al., 1997; kitchen et al., 1997; loh et al.,
1998; chen et al., 2000). mu and kappa agonist binding
were maintained in dor-deficient mice (zhu et al., 1999;
filliol et al., 2000). finally, total damgo and deltorphin
binding were unchanged in the kor homozygous mutant
(simonin et al., 1998; slowe et al., 1999). quantitative
autoradiographic mapping revealed subtle (10% on average) and regionally restricted down-regulations of delta and
kappa sites in mor-deficient mice (kitchen et al., 1997),
up-regulation of delta sites in the kor mutant mice (slowe
et al., 1999) and a tendency to regional decreases of mu
and kappa1 sites in the dor mutant mice (goody et al., in
press). in all mutants, the anatomical distribution of remaining opioid receptor sites was unchanged and, together, the
data suggest that the absence of one opioid receptor does
not drastically alter the expression of other opioid receptors.
possible adaptations, however, may occur at the level of
receptor coupling efficiency, rather than ligand binding. to
date, this was investigated only in mice lacking the mor
gene (table 1). three groups showed that snc80- and
deltorphin-stimulated [35 s]gtp␥s binding was maintained
in mor-deficient mice, suggesting integrity of  xxxg1632xxx  coupling to g proteins (matthes et al., 1998; narita
et al., 1999; hosohata et al., 2000). dpdpe stimulated
[35 s]gtp␥s binding with similar efficacy in wild-type and
mutant mice (matthes et al., 1998; narita et al., 1999),
or with slightly reduced efficacy in mutant mice at a high
dose (park et al., 2000) and in the spinal cord (hosohata
et al., 2000). the latter findings could possibly be due to
cross-reactivity of dpdpe at mu receptors in wild-type mice
(hosohata et al., 2000), resulting in overall lower efficacy
of the compound in mor mutant mice. in fact, dpdpe
shows lower selectivity towards delta receptors compared

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

to deltorphin (corbett et al., 1993; matthes et al., 1998)
and may possibly act at both mu and delta receptors under specific experimental conditions (see further comments
later in section 4.3). three different kappa agonists-induced
[35 s]gtp␥s binding activity at comparable levels in
wild-type and mor-deficient mice (matthes et al., 1998;
narita et al., 1999; park et al., 2000). altogether, the data
strongly suggest that delta and  xxxg1633xxx  coupling to g
proteins is intact in the absence of mu receptors. therefore,
the analysis of [35 s]gtp␥s binding in mor mutant mice
provides no evidence for mu–delta or mu–kappa interactions
at the cellular level. this was further supported by findings of intact dpdpe-, deltorphin- or u50,488h-inhibition
of camp production in membranes from mor mutant
mice (matthes et al., 1998). opioid-stimulated [35 s]gtp␥s
binding in dor- and kor-deficient mice has not been
reported.
just like receptor deletion does not markedly modify
expression of the other receptors, opioid peptide deletion does not seem to strongly alter the other peptides.
in ␤end-deficient mice, expression of dynorphin and
enkephalin was unchanged (rubinstein et al., 1996),  xxxg1722xxx 
homozygous mutant showed normal penk mrna and
slightly reduced pomc transcript levels in brain—to be
confirmed (sharifi et al., 2001)—and penk knockout mice
displayed normal dynorphin and ␤end immunoreactivity in
striatal extracts (könig et al., 1996).
does the absence of receptors modify expression of endogenous ligands and vice-versa? mice lacking mor, dor
or kor genes showed no obvious alteration in pomc,
penk and  xxxg1722xxx  transcripts, as demonstrated by in situ
hybridization experiments (matthes et al., 1996; simonin
et al., 1998; schuller et al., 1999; zhu et al., 1999; filliol
et al., 2000). therefore, the absence of a receptor does not
seem to regulate ligand expression. the reverse is not true,
at least for penk mutant mice (table 1). in these mice,
strong increase of mu and delta sites (up to 300%) were
observed in regions important for the emotional aspect of
opioid function, including for example the central nucleus
of the amygdala for mu receptors or the ventral pallidum for
delta receptors (brady et al., 1999). otherwise, mu, delta
and kappa agonist-stimulated [35 s]gtp␥s binding, as well
as total opioid binding were unchanged in  xxxg1722xxx  knockout
mice (wang et al., 2001), as did  xxxg1635xxx  sites in ␤end
mutants (slugg et al., 2000).
in conclusion, noticeable modifications within the opioid system were only observed in the absence of the penk
gene. otherwise changes may also occur at the level of
other functionally associated systems. initial studies have
indicated subtle modifications in orphanin fq/nociceptin
binding in dor and kor but not mor mutant mice (slowe
et al., 2001), or reduced d2 dopamine receptor expression
in the hippocampous of mor-deficient mice (matthies
et al., 2000), and many other experiments are underway.
ultimately, the gene array technology will provide a comprehensive picture of possible transcriptional modifications

291

that have developed in the absence of opioid receptor or
peptide genes.

3. behavioral phenotypes in the absence of drug
the successful generation of mor, kor and dor, ␤end,
penk and  xxxg1722xxx  knockout mice, with mutations segregated
at mendelian frequencies, indicates that the inactivation of
genes of the opioid system is not lethal. furthermore, the obtention of viable double mor/dor mutants or even triple
mor/dor/kor mutants (gavériaux-ruff et al., 2001;
simonin et al., 2001) suggests that opioid receptors, either
single or in combination, are not crucial for development, at
least when animals are raised under home cage conditions.
this is consistent with the notion that endogenous opioids
are mainly recruted under challenging situations.
to explore the contribution of each opioid peptide or
receptor in opioid physiology, animals have been examined under conditions where exogenous opiates have shown
pharmacological activities, so-called opioid-controlled behaviors. if any endogenous tone regulates these behaviors,
differences—also referred as to “phenotypes”—should be
detected between wild-type and mutant mice. at present,
phenotypes have been observed in major opioid functions
including locomotion, nociception and emotional responses
and data are summarized in table 2. the study of other
behaviors has been initiated in mutant animals (respiration,
sexual behavior, immunity, long term potentiation (ltp) and
responses to stress). results from the latter studies are not
shown on table 2, but are briefly described in section 3.1.
3.1. locomotion
the effects of opioid agonists and antagonists on mouse
locomotor activity have been somewhat inconsistent in the
past years (vaccarino and kastin, 2000). the examination
of each mutant mouse shed a new light on the role of
opioid peptides and receptors in modulating this behavior
(table 2). the locomotor activity of mor-mutant animals
has been examined by several laboratories using the various mutant strains, and data showed unchanged or slightly
reduced locomotion (matthes et al., 1996; sora et al., 1997;
tian et al., 1997; becker et al., 2000). the modification
therefore is not necessarily detectable, probably depending
on the experimental conditions or genetic background. this
phenotype of the mor mutant is consistent with the generally observed hyperlocomotor activity of morphine, and
these findings together indicate that  xxxg1635xxx  activation,
either exogenously or endogenously, promotes locomotion.
dor-deficient animals showed significant hyperlocomotion
(filliol et al., 2000), which suggests that delta receptors tonically inhibit locomotion. this result revealed opposing phenotypes for mor- and dor-deficient mice, which contrasts
with pharmacological data where both mu and delta agonists
were shown to increase locomotion (cowan, 1993). one

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

interpretation is that the previously described hyperlocomotor activity of delta agonists is, in fact, mediated by mu
receptors. another possibility is that unidentified compensatory mechanisms have developed in the absence of delta
receptors and are responsible for the observed increased
locomotion. kor-mutant mice display normal locomotor
activity, as assessed in actimetry boxes or in the open-field
test (simonin et al., 1998). pharmacological studies have
shown that the activation of  xxxg1633xxx  by exogenous
opioids decreases locomotion (pfeiffer et al., 1986). the
lack of phenotype in the kor mutants suggests a low tone
of kappa systems to control this behavior. in summary, the
comparative analysis of the three receptor-deficient mouse
strains supports the notion that endogenous activity of mor,
dor and kor either augments, reduces or has no effect on
locomotor activity, respectively, and demonstrates a distinct
implication for each receptor in modulating locomotion.
bend and  xxxg1722xxx  mice showed normal locomotor activity
(rubinstein et al., 1996; zimmer et al., 2001). penk animals
displayed reduced locomotion in the open-field assay, which
may result, in part, from increased anxiety levels (könig
et al., 1996). together with the observed hypolocomotor activity of mor mutant mice, data from the genetic approach
suggest that mor activated by endogenous penk-derived
peptides tonically stimulates locomotion. noteworthy is the
observation that hypolocomotion was not associated with
increased anxiety in the case of mor-deficient mice (filliol et al., 2000), clearly dissociating these two aspects of
behavioral responses for mu receptors.
3.2. nociception
one important function of the opioid system is the modulation of pain perception. exogenous mu, delta and kappa
opioid agonists all produce analgesia and, in addition, an
endogenous opioid tone has been proposed to regulate nociceptive information (ossipov et al., 1997). in order to evaluate the postulated tonic implication of the opioid system
in pain control, as well as to identify the specific contribution of each opioid receptor or peptide in the perception of
distinct noxious stumuli, nociceptive thresholds have been
examined in knockout mice using a wide variety of pain
models. essentially acute (thermal, mechanical, chemical)
painful stimuli have been applied, but chronic pain models
(inflammatory, neuropathic) have been used also (table 2).
to determine the sensitivity of mice to thermal pain, several tests have been used: tail immersion, tail flick, hot plate
and the plantar test. dor- and kor-deficient mice did not
exhibit any alteration in the perception of heat (zhu et al.,
1999; filliol et al., 2000; simonin et al., 1998). in contrast,
mor mutant mice showed increased sensitivity in three
different responses to heat, suggesting the existence of a
mor-mediated tone in thermal nociception (matthes et al.,
1996, 1998; sora et al., 1997; qiu et al., 2000). no change
in baseline sensitivity to thermal pain was reported in mice
devoid of ␤end. penk and  xxxg1722xxx  mutant mice showed in-

293

creased pain response in the hot plate and tail flick tests,
respectively (könig et al., 1996; wang et al., 2001). as for
locomotion, therefore, mice lacking either mor or penk
genes show a similar phenotype.
the sensitivity to mechanical pain, as determined by
response to pressure, was unaltered in mor (fuchs et al.,
1999), dor (filliol et al., 2000), kor (simonin et al.,
1998) and  xxxg1722xxx  (wang et al., 2001) mutants. sensitivity
to chemical pain was assessed by measuring writhes after
acetic acid injection, or paw licking and lifting shortly after
formalin injection. dor and  xxxg1722xxx  mutant mice showed no
difference in response to chemical pain (filliol et al., 2000;
zhu et al., 1999; wang et al., 2001). mice lacking kor
showed a dramatic enhancement of writhes in response to
acid acetic (simonin et al., 1998). this result is in line
with previous pharmacological data and highlights a tonic
implication of kappa receptors in the perception of visceral
pain. paradoxically, mor mutants displayed decreased pain
perception in response to acetic acid (sora et al., 1999), as
did penk mutant mice following formalin injection (könig
et al., 1996). these results remain unexplained, but noticeably again mor and penk mutants behave similarly.
inflammation induces long lasting pain. the endogenous
opioid system is stimulated during inflammation and it has
been proposed that not only the nervous system, but also
immune cells produce opioid peptides that are released at
inflammatory sites to induce analgesia (stein et al., 2001).
mor mutant animals were analyzed for inflammatory
hyperalgesia following complete freund adjuvant (cfa)
administration. unexpectedly, the mutant mice recovered
more rapidly from cfa-induced hyperalgesia. this recovery was blocked by the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole
and mutant mice were more responsive to delta agonist
analgesia (table 4 and section 4.3), suggesting that delta
receptor activity was augmented in these mice under conditions of persistent pain (qiu et al., 2000).  xxxg1722xxx  mutant
mice showed mild hyperalgesia in the late phase of the formalin test (wang et al., 2001), suggesting that endogenous
dynorphins produce some analgesia during inflammation.
at present, only  xxxg1722xxx  mice were analyzed in a model of
persistent neuropathic pain (not displayed on table 2; wang
et al., 2001). after spinal nerve ligation, wild-type mice
showed sustained increased response to noxious thermal,
as well as innocuous mechanical stimulation. knockout
mice showed similar responses first, but both thermal and
mechanical sensitivities reversed back to baseline values
within a few days. together with indications of dynorphin
up-regulation, these data highlight the pronociceptive activity of dynorphin in the maintenance of neuropathic pain.
in conclusion, the present data on pain responses in knockout mice of the opioid system show phenotypic modifications for each mutant, with the exception of dor and ␤end
mutants. in models of acute pain the deletion of an opioid
receptor or peptide generally increases sensitivity to acute
noxious stimulation, consistent with the pharmacology. the
genetic approach therefore confirms the existence of an

294

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

antinociceptive endogenous opioid tone, probably subtle,
under conditions of “physiological” pain. importantly, the
different phenotypes observed throughout the various assays
clearly show a distinct implication of each component of the
opioid system in different pain modalities of acute pain. ideally, parallel studies using all mutants in the several models
would produce a clearer picture of their respective contributions. few studies were performed using models of chronic
pain, as yet. it is expected from first data, and from our
present knowledge of mechanisms underlying inflammatory
or neuropathic pain, that phenotypes will be very different
because important adaptations of the opioid system and other
systems occur during the development of long lasting pain.
3.3. emotional responses
in addition to the well described actions of opioids on
pain and addiction, some evidences indicate that opioids can
modify emotional responses. this aspect of opioid function
is, however, little documented (naber, 1993). recently, all
three strains of opioid receptor-deficient mice were compared to wild-type animals in several models of anxiety
or depression (filliol et al., 2000). in these paradigms,
kor-mutant mice did not show any alteration, suggesting
that kappa receptors are not tonically involved to control
these behaviors. in contrast, mor and dor knockout
animals differed from their wild-type littermates, and further, showed opposite phenotypes. as previously found for
locomotor activity, this result contrasts with the classical
notion of similar biological roles for mu and delta receptors.
importantly, dor mutant mice displayed consistent anxiogenic and depressive-like responses, suggesting that the
endogenous activity of delta receptors may positively modulate mood states. consequently, delta agonists may have
a therapeutic potential to treat affective disorders, a possibility that has been barely explored by the pharmacology
(baamonde et al., 1992; tejedor-real et al., 1998).
mice lacking ␤end or penk were also analyzed for emotional responses (table 2). whereas the ␤end mice did not
show any alteration in levels of anxiety, the two different
strains of penk mutant mice displayed increased responses
in anxiety-evoking environments. these animals were also
more responsive in a fear conditioning paradigm (ragnauth
et al., 2001), as well as in a model of aggressive behavior (könig et al., 1996). altogether, these data suggest that
endogenous enkephalins could act to lower exaggerated or
depressive-like responses to stressful environmental stimuli.
from data obtained with dor mutant mice, it seems that
this activity of preproenkephalin-derived peptides could be
mediated, at least partially, by delta receptors.
3.4. others
3.4.1. respiration
exogenously administered opiates potently depress respiration (shook et al., 1990). ventilatory patterns were com-

pared in wild-type and mor knockout mice. in one set of
studies, mutant mice showed normal respiratory frequency,
inspiratory time and minute volume at rest (matthes et al.,
1998; morin-surun et al., 2001). also, responses to hyperoxia (high o2 ), hypoxia (low o2 ) or hypercania (co2 ) were
unchanged (morin-surun et al., 2001). in another study,
breathing frequency was slightly increased (15%) while the
hypercapnic response was unchanged (dahan et al., 2001).
altogether the data suggest a low mu-opioid receptor tone
in the control of respiration. respiratory parameters have
not been evaluated in other mutants of the opioid system.
3.4.2. long term potentiation
opioids given exogenously modulate ltp in the hippocampus (simmons and chavkin, 1996). the influence
of a putative endogenous  xxxg1635xxx  tone on synaptic
plasticity in the hippocampus was measured by comparing
ltp in wild-type and mor knockout mice (matthies et al.,
2000). mor deletion decreased ltp in the dentate gyrus,
but did not induce any change in the ca1 region, demonstrating a role for mu receptors in a specific hippocampal
subregion. this study also showed a reduction in dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  expression in the hippocampus. no behavioral
studies, correlating ltp deficits with potential impairment
of spatial memory, have been reported.
3.4.3. reproduction
exogenous opiates inhibit reproductive functions and
the endogenous opioid system is proposed to exert a
tonic influence on reproductive physiology via regulation of  xxxg930xxx  and luteinizing
hormone levels (almeida, 1993). initial descriptions of
mor-deficient mice did not report any deficit of sexual functions in males and females or impairment of maternal behavior in females (matthes et al., 1996; sora et al., 1997; loh
et al., 1998; schuller et al., 1999). in one study, sexual behavior was studied in details and the analysis of mutant males
highlighted alterations of mating behavior, sperm counts
and sperm motility (tian et al., 1997). this was unexpected
since pharmacological data show an inhibitory activity of
morphine on reproduction (vaccarino and kastin, 2000).
increased litter size was observed in kor-deficient mice
(simonin et al., 1998). lordotic behavior and approach to
males was unchanged in penk mutant mice (ragnauth et al.,
2001). studies on the reproductive functions of mice lacking
dor, kor, ␤end or  xxxg1722xxx  genes remain to be done and more
generally, the analysis of reproductive functions in knockout
mice of the opioid system deserves further exploration.
3.4.4. hematology–immunology
the modulation of immunity by opioids has been reported for a long time, and many immune functions are
altered by opioid treatment (for review see eisenstein and
hilburger (1998) and sharp et al. (1998)). the study of
immune responses in mice lacking the known genes of the
opioid system is important for three reasons. first, some

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

immune effects of opioids were proposed to be mediated
by receptors others than the classical opioid receptors
(stefano et al., 1996). second, the presence of opioid receptors in immune cells that are identical to those expressed by
neurons was difficult to demonstrate. third, the pharmacological consequences of exogenously administered opioid
compounds often appear discordant and the genetic approach offers another mean to understand the complex modulation of immune parameters by the endogenous opioid
system.
in a first study, the number of bone marrow progenitor
cells were higher in mor mutant mice, with no change in
mature blood cell numbers in the blood (tian et al., 1997),
suggesting that endogenous  xxxg1635xxx  activation plays
a role in hematopoiesis. another report showed no difference in the weight of thymus, and a decrease in thymocyte proliferation in vitro in mor-deficient animals (roy
et al., 1998a), suggesting a possible role of endogenous
mu receptors on immature t cell proliferation. in a third
study, a number of immune parameters were compared in
wild-type and mor knockout mice. these included thymus
and spleen cellularity, t lymphocyte distribution in the thymus, b and t cells distribution in the spleen, natural killer
activity, mitogen-induced t and b cell proliferation in vitro
as well as basal immunoglobulin levels in the serum. none
of these were changed in mutant animals (gavériaux-ruff
et al., 1998), suggesting that these immune functions are not
critically regulated by a  xxxg1635xxx  tone.
in dor-deficient mice, several t lymphocyte functions
were studied (gavériaux-ruff et al., 2001). mutant mice
displayed normal spleen cell numbers and unchanged proliferative responses to  xxxd2620xxx  or to allogeneic
stimulation in vitro. kor-mutant mice showed a modest
reduction of thymocyte numbers accompanied by a slight
increase in immature cells, augmented splenocyte numbers
and unchanged proliferation after mitogenic or allogeneic
stimulation (gavériaux-ruff et al., 2002).
one major immune function is the humoral response to
infectious agents or other environmental antigens. in order
to evaluate the contribution of mu, delta and  xxxg1633xxx 
activities in this response, all three strains of mice lacking
opioid receptors were compared to wild-type mice for their
capacity to produce specific antibodies after immunization
in vivo. mor- and dor-mutant animals displayed normal
antibody levels whereas kor-mutants exhibited a higher response (gavériaux-ruff et al., 2002). this result suggests the
existence of an endogenous  xxxg1633xxx  activity which
inhibits antibody production, in accordance with data showing that kappa opioid agonists suppress antibody response
(eisenstein and hilburger, 1998; radulovic et al., 1995).
inflammatory response was studied in penk-deficient mice
using two models of airway inflammation (hook et al.,
2000). in these mutant animals,  xxxg1180xxx  production
and eosinophil infiltration were reduced as compared to
wild-type animals, suggesting that preproenkephalin-derived
peptides enhance th2 cell function and inflammation.

295

3.4.5. responses to stress
exposure to stress induces analgesia, which can be partially reversed by opioid antagonists and it has been proposed
that released endogenous opioid peptides are responsible for
the stress-induced analgesia (sia). the opioid component
of sia is dependent upon a number of experimental parameters. when forced swim is used for example, the extent
of naloxone reversal depends on the temperature and swim
duration and is maximal under milder conditions. the pharmacology has essentially implicated mu and delta receptors
in sia but evidently more studies are needed to precisely
assign a role of each receptor type depending on the stressor
(for reviews see przewlocki, 1993; yamada and nabeshima,
1995). only one study has reported sia in mice lacking
opioid receptors (labuda et al., 2000). mor-deficient mice
were analyzed using the paw withdrawal response to thermal
pain following forced swim (3 min 20 ◦ c). mor-mutant
mice displayed less sia than wild-type mice 15 min after
stress but not in the 5 min initial phase, indicating that mu
receptors are implicated in the late phase of sia. in addition, treatment with the delta antagonist naltrindole further
reduced sia in the mutant mice, indicating a role for delta
receptors also, in this model. the study of animals lacking
opioid peptides showed no change in sia for penk mutants,
as measured by the hot plate assay following application
of forced swim in warm (34 ◦ c, maximal opioid-dependent
sia) or cold (4 ◦ c, partial opioid-dependent sia) water (könig et al., 1996). in contrast, a modification of
sia was observed in the ␤end mutant mice (rubinstein
et al., 1996). in this study, the authors could not detect
naloxone-reversible sia in wild-type mice using the hot
plate test as a read out. instead, they used the more sensitive
abdominal constriction assay and found an almost complete abolition of sia in mutant mice under conditions that
produced strong analgesia in control mice (swim at 20 ◦ c,
45 s). paradoxically, naloxone produced sia in the ␤end
mutant mice, a phenomenon which remains to be explained.
major pathways activated after stress are the sympathetic
system and the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis.
along the hpa axis, corticotropin releasing factor, opioid
peptides, acth, and glucocorticoids mediate the different biological consequences of stress (przewlocki, 1993).
opioids, and particularly morphine, have been reported to
elevate circulating stress hormones levels, thus indirectly
depressing immune functions (mellon and bayer, 1998).
unexpectedly, one study reported elevated basal acth and
corticosterone levels in mor-deficient mice (roy et al.,
2001), suggesting that an endogenous mu tone, in fact,
would depress levels of these hormones. measurement
of basal hormone levels in mice lacking opioid peptides
could help clarify this finding. in the same study, morphine otherwise elevated plasma acth and corticosterone
in wild-type mice, as expected, but not in mor-deficient
animals confirming that the stimulation of mu receptors by
exogenous opiates activates the hpa axis. there is no report
on changes of these hormones under stress in mutant mice.

296

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

one of the consequences of stress is plasma glucose
lowering after experimental diabetes induction with  xxxd3249xxx . this model of stress was applied to wild-type
and mor-deficient mice. the stress-induced glucose lowering response was lost in the mutant mice, as well as in
adrenalectomized wild-type mice, suggesting a peripheral
mu-mediated stress response (liu et al., 2001).

4. responses to opiates
during the several decades preceding molecular cloning
of opioid receptors, enormous efforts have aimed at developing specific mu, delta and kappa agonists or antagonists
to probe the opioid system. pharmacological activity of
this collection of “prototypic” opiates forms the basis for
our current knowledge of opioid receptor function. mice
lacking opioid receptors represent ideal models to evaluate
the molecular mechanism of action of prototypic opiates in
a whole animal and under a large variety of experimental

conditions. theoretically, the biological activity of highly
selective mu, delta and kappa agonists should be abolished
in mice lacking the mor, dor and kor genes, respectively. residual activities could be considered as resulting
from cross-activation of remaining receptors. ultimately,
the comparison of responses of wild-type and mutant mice
to a number of opiates exhibiting a range of receptor selectivities should clarify the specific contribution of mu, delta
or kappa receptors in the main pharmacological activities of
exogenous opiates, including analgesia, reward and dependence. indeed, the combination of pharmacology and genetics has now provided a clearer picture on consequences
of the activation of each opioid receptor activation in vivo.
4.1. morphine and other mu agonists
the activity of morphine, the best-famed opiate, was
first examined in mor mutant mice. data obtained from
morphine-treated mor-deficient mice have been reviewed extensively earlier (table 3; hayward and low, 1999;

kieffer, 1999, 2000; valverde et al., 1998) and proved extraordinarily clear cut. none of the pharmacological activities of morphine, which are classically observed in wild-type
mice, could be detected in mutant mice lacking the mor
gene. analgesia, considered the main therapeutic activity,
was absent in all the mor mutant mice, at doses that produce
maximal analgesia in wild-type mice (matthes et al., 1996;
sora et al., 1997, 1999; loh et al., 1998; schuller et al., 1999;
fuchs et al., 1999). reward, the other main biological action
of morphine, was also ablated in mutant mice (matthes et al.,
1996; sora et al., 2001). morphine was even found aversive
in self-administration experiments, as a probable consequence of  xxxg1633xxx  activation (becker et al., 2000).
the investigation of other acute morphine effects showed no
respiratory depression (matthes et al., 1998; dahan et al.,
2001), constipation (roy et al., 1998a), inhibition of vas
deferens contractions (maldonado et al., 2001) or increased
production of stress hormones (roy et al., 2001) in those
mice. other morphine effects were also abolished, including
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal (matthes et al., 1996; sora
et al., 2001) and down-regulation of dynamin (noble et al.,
2000) in the brain, or immunosuppression (gavériaux-ruff
et al., 1998; roy et al., 1998b). the genetic approach, therefore, unambiguously demonstrated that mu receptors are
essential for all the biological activities elicited by morphine
under classical experimental conditions. these data therefore suggest that morphine does not require dor and kor
for full activity, despite the fact that (i) morphine selectivity
is rather low for mor in vitro (70- and 40-fold toward
dor and kor in mouse brain (matthes et al., 1998) and
(ii) dor and kor receptors are present and functional in
mor-deficient mice (table 1). the notion that morphine activities are independent from delta and kappa receptors was
further supported by the finding of intact morphine analgesia
in kor- and dor-deficient mice. importantly, these results
also indicate that the activation of mor necessarily elicits
both analgesic and undesirable effects, making this receptor
definitely difficult to target on a therapeutic standpoint.
those data do not exclude a participation of delta and
kappa receptors in long-term morphine effects. in fact,
morphine withdrawal was attenuated in kor mutant mice
(simonin et al., 1998) and tolerance to the analgesic effect
of morphine did not develop in the dor mutant (zhu et al.,
1999). the two “non-mu” receptors therefore, although
not directly activated by morphine, nevertheless contribute
to the establishment of dependence (kor) and tolerance
(dor) presumably downstream mu receptors within the
opioid circuitry.
an interesting study examined morphine responses in
mice heterozygous for the mor mutation (sora et al.,
2001). these mice express half the number of  xxxg1635xxx 
sites and gene dosage effects should be indicative of  xxxg1635xxx  occupancy in various brain circuits in vivo. morphine
analgesia, locomotion and self-administration were reduced
in heterozygous animals, suggesting little  xxxg1635xxx  reserve for these responses. in contrast, morphine tolerance to

297

analgesia and morphine dependence were fully expressed
in the one-allele mutant animals, indicating large amounts
of spare receptors for the chronic effects of morphine. one
may speculate that the activation of few receptor molecules
is sufficient to elicit the long-term effects of morphine.
a number of other mu agonists have been tested in
mor-deficient mice. several studies have indicated that
heroin and morphine-6-glucuronide (m6g) (kitanaka et al.,
1998; loh et al., 1998; maldonado, unpublished), a major
morphine metabolite, do not produce analgesia in mutant
mice, extending the previous morphine data to close morphine derivatives. one study showed maintained heroin and
m6g analgesia in exon 1 but not exon 2 mor-deficient
mice (schuller et al., 1999), suggesting the possible existence of mor splice variants whose functional relevance
remains to be established. finally, the clinically important
compound methadone, as well as the highly mu-specific
agonists endomorphin-1 and -2 produced no analgesia, and
all activities of damgo were absent in the mutant mice
(table 3; connor et al., 1999). together, the data indicate
that, as for morphine, mor mediates the main biological
activities of prototypal mu agonists.
finally, morphine analgesia, hyperlocomotion, reward
and withdrawal were unchanged in the  xxxg1722xxx  mutant (zimmer et al., 2001), indicating that major morphine effects
do not require the presence of endogenous  xxxg1722xxx 
peptides. similarly systemic morphine analgesia was unchanged in the absence of ␤end (rubinstein et al., 1996),
while subtle modifications were noted when morphine was
administered intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intrathecal
(i.t.) (mogil et al., 2000).
4.2. kappa agonists
the analysis of in vivo responses of opioid receptordeficient mice to kappa agonists has provided results consistent with the previous pharmacology (table 4). the
analgesic action of u50,488h, studied in many different
models, is abolished in kor-deficient mice (simonin et al.,
1998), while it is maintained in mor- and dor-deficient
mice (matthes et al., 1998; loh et al., 1998; schuller et al.,
1999; sora et al., 1999; fuchs et al., 1999; zhu et al., 1999).
hypolocomotion and dysphoria, two other main actions
of the prototypic kappa agonist, are strongly reduced in
the kor mutant (simonin et al., 1998). finally u50,488h
respiratory depression and u69,593 antihyperalgesia are
maintained in the mor mutant (matthes et al., 1998; qiu
et al., 2000). the data together strongly suggest that (i) prototypal kappa agonists are reasonably kappa-selective under
classical in vivo experimental conditions and (ii) kappa
analgesia is independent from mu and delta receptors.
as for morphine, u50,488h analgesia and hypolocomotion were unchanged in the  xxxg1722xxx  mutant, suggesting that
 xxxg1722xxx -derived peptides generally do not participate to analgesia produced by exogenous kappa opioid
compounds (zimmer et al., 2001).

4.3. delta agonists
because functional interactions between mu and delta
receptors have been postulated by the pharmacology both
in vivo and in vitro (rothman et al., 1993; traynor and
elliot, 1993; devi, 2001) and because the  xxxg1632xxx  has
been evaluated as a potential therapeutic target for several
years (dondio et al., 1997; rapaka and porreca, 1991),
studies on the activity of delta agonists in mor-deficient
mice have been the focus of much interest. the data are
summarized in table 4. interpretation of the results is by far

not as straightforward as that of data obtained using kappa
agonists.
delta analgesia was most extensively examined in
mor-deficient mice. deltorphin and dpdpe were ineffective, partially or fully effective in reducing responses to
thermal pain, depending on the test or mode of administration (matthes et al., 1998; loh et al., 1998; schuller et al.,
1999; fuchs et al., 1999; hosohata et al., 2000; sora et al.,
1997). dpdpe and snc80 analgesia were strongly decreased in models of mechanical pain and visceral chemical
nociception, respectively (fuchs et al., 1999; sora et al.,

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

1999). several non-analgesic effects of delta agonists were
also investigated in vivo. deltorphin respiratory depression,
reward and physical dependence were absent in the mor
mutant, following i.c.v. administration (matthes et al., 1998;
hutcheson et al., 2001). together these data suggest that
mu receptors are required—to various extents—for full responses to delta agonists. the question of whether this is
due to cross-reactivity of the delta compounds at mu receptors in wild-type animals in vivo, or whether delta receptors
do not work independently from mu receptors, remains
open.
in some cases cross-reactivity could be a simple explanation, particularly in situations where lower delta selectivity correlates with reduced activity in the mor mutant.
as an example, binding studies showed that dpdpe is
less selective for delta receptors than deltorphin in mouse
brain (matthes et al., 1998). the finding of decreased
dpdpe analgesia and maintained deltorphin analgesia in
mor-deficient mice by hosohata et al. (2000) could mean
that, in wild-type mice and under the experimental conditions of this study, dpdpe produces analgesia by activating
both mu and delta receptors while deltorphin analgesia is
mediated solely by delta receptors.
low selectivity of delta compounds in vivo, however, is
not sufficient to explain all the data. first several biological
activities of deltorphin, the most delta-selective compound,
are reduced in the absence of mu receptors (table 4). further, selectivities of delta compounds do not necessarily correlate with modifications of their biological activity in mor
mutant mice. in the vas deferens of mutant mice for example, activity of the most selective compound deltorphin is
slightly decreased while activity of dpdpe (less selective)
seems unchanged (maldonado et al., 2001). second, parallel findings do not seem to apply to mu and kappa agonists
(sections 4.1 and 4.2) whose activities are maintained in
the absence of dor and kor (mu agonist) or mor (kappa
agonists). in fact, morphine is less selective for mu receptors in vitro, than deltorphin, dpdpe and snc80 for delta
receptors, but nevertheless shows normal analgesia in dor
and kor mutants, indicating that delta and kappa receptors
do not contribute to this activity (section 4.1). u50,488h
and u69,593 show kappa selectivities in vitro comparable
to those of deltorphin, dpdpe and snc80 for delta receptors and display full analgesia in the mor mutant mice,
indicating that mu receptors are not required for their analgesic activity. therefore, in addition to the possible lack of
selectivity of the delta compounds, the decreased activity of
delta agonists in mor-deficient mice could also be due to
functional interactions between mu and delta receptors. the
mu– xxxg1632xxx  cross-talk has long been postulated by the
pharmacology (rothman et al., 1993; traynor and elliot,
1993) and seems now supported by the genetic approach,
at least under specific experimental conditions. in the mor
mutant, alterations of delta agonist activity were not evidenced at the level of ligand binding or g protein activation (section 2.4), suggesting that the postulated mu–delta

299

interactions may take place between distant receptors within
specific brain circuits rather than from direct mu–delta
receptor interactions at the cell membrane (devi, 2001).
interpretation of those data is complicated by pharmacokinetic considerations. although binding selectivities are
known from in vitro data, bioavailability of the compounds
(the precise concentration reaching the receptors) is unknown and the selectivity and specificity of delta agonists
also relies on their access to dor. one example is the effect
of deltorphin on respiration. when injected i.c.v., deltorphin
depressed respiratory parameters in wild-type mice but not
in mor mutants, indicating that mu receptors are needed for
this activity of deltorphin in vivo. however, when respiratory neurons of mor-deficient mice were isolated in slices,
deltorphin was fully active and efficiently reduced firing frequencies of respiratory neurons (morin-surun et al., 2001).
one explanation is that deltorphin is unable to reach dor in
respiratory neurons when administred i.c.v. in a whole animal, and produces its depressant activity via mor, while the
same compound is able to modulate dor in the slice preparation probably due to a better availability of the receptors.
finally, an important observation is the striking lack of
deltorphin conditioned place preference and withdrawal in
mor mutant mice (hutcheson et al., 2001). this result
strongly suggests that deltorphin reward and dependence are
mediated by mor rather than dor. conceivably, deltorphin injected repeatedly (place preference) or continuously
infused (withdrawal) into the mouse ventricule is able to
activate mesolimbic mu receptors responsible for those
behaviors in wild-type mice. otherwise, the acute administration of deltorphin i.c.v., at comparable dosage, produced
analgesia in mor-deficient mice (matthes et al., 1998)
and together the data suggest that the addictive but not the
analgesic actions of deltorphin are mediated by mor.
in summary, studies of delta agonist activity at mordeficient mice indicate that (i) selectivity of prototypic
delta compounds may be questionable under some in vivo
experimental conditions, (ii) delta receptors may partially
require mor for full activity in vivo, particularly in nociceptive circuits, (iii) delta receptors are nevertheless able to
produce analgesia independently from mor and (iv) it is
likely that the addictive properties of delta compounds are
not mediated by dor.
clearly, these studies should be complemented by parallel experiments examining delta agonist activities in mice
lacking dor. in a first report (zhu et al., 1999), dpdpe
and deltorphin analgesia were strongly reduced in the dor
mutant using the tail flick test after i.t. administration. also,
the antinociceptive action of dpdpe in the formalin test
was abolished in these mice. together these data showed a
clear  xxxg1632xxx -mediated analgesic activity of the delta
agonists. however, deltorphin and dpdpe analgesia was
maintained in the dor mutants when the compounds were
injected i.c.v., suggesting that supraspinal analgesia of the
two compounds recruits receptors other than dor, possibly
mor. paralleled with data from mor-deficient mice, this

300

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

strengthens the notion that deltorphin and dpdpe analgesia
may require either mu or delta or both receptors depending on the experimental design. the fact that supraspinal
deltorphin analgesia is “maintained” in both mor- and
dor-deficient mice (table 4), from separate studies in
distinct laboratories requires further true comparative experiments to delineate the respective contribution of mor
and dor in deltorphin analgesia.
finally, in contrast to most studies that have shown
decreased activity of delta agonists in both mor- and
dor-deficient mice, two other studies showed increased
activity of delta compounds. in a model of persistent pain
(cfa), both dpdpe and deltorphin proved more efficient
in reducing inflammatory hyperalgesia in mor mutants,
suggesting that, in this case, dor activity may have increased to overcome the absence of mor (qiu et al., 2000).
also a striking increase of bw373u86 analgesia was observed in dor-deficient mice, suggesting a compensatory
up-regulation of another delta system, yet to be characterized (zhu et al., 1999). those data are suggestive of developmental modifications in the knockout animals, which
otherwise could not be evidenced by binding or signaling
studies (section 2.4) and need further exploration.
4.4. conclusions on opioid pharmacology
the combination of pharmacological agents and genetic
mouse models has simultaneously addressed several issues,
including (i) opioid agonist selectivity in vivo, (ii) functional
interactions between opioid receptors and (iii) the specific
physiological role of each opioid receptor. for historical
reasons, most studies were performed on mor-deficient
animals (several strains produced), and studies have brought
both clear cut and complex results. a tentative interpretation of those data is proposed on fig. 3. one important
conclusion is that, independently from the agonists that
have been used and their variable selectivities, the study of
responses of mor-, dor- and kor-deficient mice to opioid agonists clarifies the biological activity of each receptor
protein. it is obvious that activating mor-encoded receptors produces a wide array of biological events (section
4.1), which indeed reflect the well-known pharmacological
profile of opiates used in the clinic (morphine, fentanyl,
methadone) or abused world-wide (heroin). mor therefore
represents the major molecular gate for opioid analgesia and
addiction. the activation of kor clearly evokes analgesia
and dysphoria. the activation of dor produces analgesia,
while delta agonist-evoked reinforcement and dependence
seems mediated by mor. results from knockout mice
therefore highlight the notion that each receptor protein
is a very distinct player of the opioid system both from
the observation of behavioral phenotypes in the absence
of drug (section 3) and responses to opiates (this section).
another conclusion is that interactions between mu and
delta systems could occur, at least in some responses, while
kappa receptors seem to act independently from the two

fig. 3. opioid pharmacology and the knockout models. the analysis of
responses of mor-, dor- and kor-deficient mice to prototypal opiates
has clarified the role of each opioid receptor in the main actions of opiate
drugs. the mu receptors are essential for the activity of morphine and
trigger the large set of well-known opiate activities that are clinically useful
or relevant to opiate addiction. the kappa receptors mediate both dysphoric
and analgesic activities of classical kappa agonists. some activities of
delta agonists require both mu and delta receptors. delta receptors produce
analgesia, do not seem to mediate opioid reward and dependence and
may have other roles—such as improving mood states (see text)—which
remain to be further explored. finally, mu and delta receptors may interact
functionally while kappa receptors act independently.

other receptors, a conclusion which is in line with previous
pharmacology.
4.5. non-classical opioid pharmacology
the triple opioid receptor knockout mice are unique
tools to explore “non-classical” opioid pharmacology and
investigate the possibility of yet uncloned opioid receptors.
the correspondence between the multiple opioid receptor
subtypes described by the pharmacology and the three identified genes remains a matter of debate (gavériaux-ruff and
kieffer, 1999; pasternak, 1993). one issue is the postulated
existence of kappa2 receptor sites distinct from kappa1 receptors. the kappa2 sites are classically revealed by labeling
using the non-selective compound [3 h] bremazocine and defined as residual [3 h] bremazocine binding in the presence
of excess cold damgo (mu), dpdpe (delta) and ci-977
(kappa1), representing about 20% of total [3 h] bremazocine
binding in mice. no selective compound for kappa2 sites
is available. to explore the genetic origin of kappa2 sites,
[3 h] bremazocine binding was quantified in brain membranes from single opioid receptor-deficient mice, as well as
the triple mutant. the data indicated that binding at mor,
dor and kor gene products accounts for 100% of the
binding, and most importantly, [3 h] bremazocine binding
was totally suppressed in the triple knockout mice (simonin
et al., 2001). this study demonstrated that kappa2 sites result from a combination of [3 h] bremazocine binding to the
three known opioid receptor proteins and that no additional
gene is required to explain kappa2 receptor pharmacology.
another issue is the potent immunosuppressive activity of naltrindole, (delta selective antagonist) in the graft

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

rejection process, postulated to be a  xxxg1632xxx -mediated
phenomenon. this activity was tested using the mixed
lymphocyte reaction assay in vitro. naltrindole and two
close derivatives showed the described inhibitory effect
in wild-type mice, and this effect was identical in the
dor-deficient mutant mice and, more importantly, in the
triple mor/dor/kor mutant (gavériaux-ruff et al.,
2001). this result clearly indicated that another molecular target should be identified to explain this intriguing
biological activity of the prototypic delta antagonist.
other peculiar opioid receptor sites remain to be clarified
at the molecular level and the triple knockout mutant mice
will be undoubtedly be interesting to investigate, e.g. the
multiplicity of ␤end binding and effects (narita and tseng,
1998).
5. responses to other drugs
5.1. cannabinoids
similarly to opioids, cannabinoids (cbs) induce antinociception, reward and dependence (felder and glass, 1998).
in addition, pharmacological studies have provided strong
evidence for interactions between cb and opioid systems
(manzanares et al., 1999). it was anticipated that mice lacking components of the opioid system would exhibit altered
responses to cbs, just like mice lacking cb1 receptors
showed altered responses to opioids (ledent et al., 1999;
lichtman et al., 2001; mascia et al., 1999).
mice lacking mor, dor and kor were examined in
parallel experiments for their responses to  xxxd1943xxx  (thc) (ghozland et al., 2002). acute responses
to thc, including hypothermia, analgesia and hypolocomotion were unchanged. tolerance to these effects was
unchanged in the mor and dor mutants, and minimally
modified in kor-deficient mice. in the same study, thc
rewarding and aversive properties were analyzed using
several conditioned place preference paradigms. the data
revealed that the absence of mor abolishes thc reward.
in contrast, the inactivation of kor abrogates aversion to
thc and furthermore, unmasks thc place preference. the
authors therefore suggest that activities of mor and kor
form the basis for the dual euphoric–dysphoric actions of
cbs, in line with previous reports suggesting an opposing
activity of the two receptors in modulating mesolimbic reward pathways (spanagel et al., 1992). no phenotype was
observed in the dor mutant in these experiments.
the development of dependence was analyzed after chronic thc administration using  xxxd3125xxx  (cb
antagonist)-precipitated withdrawal. signs of withdrawal
were unchanged for all three mutant strains in the first study
following a 20 mg/kg treatment (ghozland et al., 2002). in
another study, withdrawal was reduced in mor-deficient
mice after chronic thc treatments using 30 and 100,
but not 10 mg/kg (lichtman et al., 2001), indicating an

301

implication of mu receptors at high thc doses. previous
pharmacological data have shown that naloxone precipitates an opioid-like withdrawal syndrome in cb tolerant
rodents (manzanares et al., 1999). these data suggest that
mu receptors at least (lichtman et al., 2001), and probably a combination of several opioid receptors (ghozland
et al., 2002), do participate in the expression of thc
withdrawal.
 xxxg1722xxx - and penk-deficient mice were also tested for their
response to thc. in the penk mutant thc antinociception
was reduced and the development of tolerance to analgesia developed slower. further  xxxd3125xxx -precipitated
withdrawal was reduced, suggesting a participation of
preproenkephalin-derived peptides in both acute and chronic
effects of thc (valverde et al., 2000). in mice lacking  xxxg1722xxx ,
thc antinociception was also reduced and conditioned
place aversion was abolished, suggesting that dynorphin
participates to thc-induced dysphoria. thc withdrawal
or tolerance to analgesia were otherwise unchanged (zimmer et al., 2001). therefore, both penk and  xxxg1722xxx  genes
are implicated in thc analgesia, penk but not  xxxg1722xxx , is
involved in thc-induced tolerance and dependence and
 xxxg1722xxx  gene-encoded peptides mediate the aversive action
of thc.
in conclusion, thc has been extensively tested in mice
knockout for the opioid system and numerous phenotypes
have been observed, supporting the previously postulated
cross-talk between endogenous cbs and opioids. in addition, the many studies that were performed allow to speculate on possible opioid receptor/peptide partnerships in
modulating thc effects. the data suggest that kor activated by  xxxg1722xxx  peptides is required for thc dysphoria, and
also that mor stimulated by penk peptides participates to
thc dependence.
5.2. alcohol
non-selective opioid antagonists such as naltrexone have
been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in both animal
models and humans. these findings have led to postulate
that alcohol could trigger release of endogenous opioid
peptides, and that these peptides acting at opioid receptors
could form a basis for ethanol reinforcement (hertz, 1997).
the hypothesized changes in opioid peptide levels following alcohol, and the nature of specific opioid peptides or
receptors involved, have been difficult to clarify by the pharmacology (van ree et al., 1999). the possible implication
of a  xxxg1635xxx  tone in alcohol consumption was studied
using mor-deficient animals. both nosepoke and lever
operant self-administration paradigms, as well as several
tests based on the two-bottle choice, consistently showed
that mor-mutant mice do not self-administer ethanol, and
even showed an aversion (roberts et al., 2000). similarly,
in another study, mor knockout mice consumed less alcohol than wild-type mice in the two bottle choice, and
showed less alcohol reward in a test of conditioned place

302

b.l. kieffer, c. gavériaux-ruff / progress in neurobiology 66 (2002) 285–306

preference (hall et al., 2001). in addition, mor-deficient
animals displayed decreased  xxxd102xxx stimulated locomotion
(hall et al., 2001). otherwise, the anxiolytic properties of
alcohol, evidenced by increased time spent on the open
arms of the elevated plus-maze, were not modified in the
mor mutant (labuda and fuchs, 2001). in the latter study,
diazepam, acting at gaba-a receptors, also had similar
activity in the two mouse strains (see later paragraphs).
therefore, anxiolysis elicited by either alcohol or diazepam
is independent from mu receptors. altogether, the data suggest that mor is required for the reinforcing action, but
not the anxiolytic effect of alcohol.
delta receptors contribute also, but very differently, to
alcohol consumption. dor-deficient mice were examined
in a set of alcohol self-administration paradigms (roberts
et al., 2001) identical to those used in the previous study
using the mor mutant (roberts et al., 2000). strikingly, the
dor mutant, which initially showed no obvious preference,
developed a preference for alcohol and self-administered
more during the self-administration training (roberts et al.,
2001). further, alcohol consumption in this procedure was
able to reverse the previously observed high levels of anxiety (filliol et al., 2000). in contrast to mor, therefore, an
absence of dor activity is associated with increased alcohol
consumption and it was suggested that dor could modulate
alcohol intake behavior via an activity on anxiety-related
behaviors (roberts et al., 2001). kor-deficient mice have
not tested for alcohol drinking.
bend mutant mice were tested for oral ethanol administration (grisel et al., 1999). in their two-bottle choice
paradigm, the authors found a consistent increased alcohol
intake in heterozygous mutants, suggesting that ␤end could
modulate alcohol drinking behavior. in another study, ␤end
intravenous self-administration seemed to be acquired by
the ␤end mutant but not wild-type mice (grahame et al.,
1998). the exact implication of ␤end therefore deserves
further exploration and complementary studies of penk
and  xxxg1722xxx  mutant mice will be extremely informative to
understand the role of opioid peptides in responses to
alcohol.
5.3. other drugs
the effect of a number of non-opioid drugs was studied
in mor-deficient mice.
5.3.1. apomorphine
to investigate opioid–dopamine interactions mor
knockout mice were analyzed for the stimulatory effect of
apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, on climbing behavior
(jang et al., 2001; jang et al., 2000). apomorphine had
a similar activity in wild-type and mor-deficient mice,
showing no  xxxg1635xxx  regulation of dopamine function
under those conditions. the well-known potentiation of
apomorphine-induced climbing behavior by morphine was
also investigated. this effect was abolished in the mutant

mice, demonstrating once again the essential contribution
of mor to morphine activity (table 3).
5.3.2. gaba drugs
pentobarbital, acting at gaba receptors, induces hypothermia, loss of righting reflex and loss of motor coordination. morphine was shown to potentiate these activities of
pentobarbital, suggesting an influence of mu-opioid receptors in gabaergic transmission. in mor-deficient mice,
the effects of pentobarbital alone were unchanged except
hypothermia that was slightly reduced. all the potentiating
effects of morphine were abolished, demonstrating another
mor-mediated activity of morphine (table 3; park et al.,
2001).
benzodiazepines are potent anxiolytic compounds and
an involvement of the endogenous opioid system has been
proposed (agmo and belzung, 1998; tsuda et al., 1996).
as shown for alcohol (section 5.3.2), diazepam reduced
anxiety to the same extent in normal and mor mutant animals, suggesting a  xxxg1635xxx -independent activity of the
compound (labuda and fuchs, 2001).
5.3.3. anesthetics
 xxxd3197xxx  is an inhalation anesthetic that also depresses
respiration. anesthetics and opiates are often combined
because of their synergistic effects on anesthetic potency
(dahan et al., 2001). both anesthetic potency and respiratory depression induced by  xxxd3197xxx  were studied in
mor mutant mice.  xxxd3197xxx  at a 1% concentration induced similar reduction in resting ventilation and slope of
ventilation–carbon dioxide response in wild-type and mutant mice. the anesthetic potency of  xxxd3197xxx , however,
was 20% lower in the mor mutant. these data highlight
the implication of endogenous mu systems in  xxxd3197xxx 
anesthetia but not ventilatory depression.
nitrous oxide (n2 o) is an adjunctive anesthetic used for
surgical procedures. previous evidence, mostly in animal
models, suggest an involvement of the opioid system in n2 o
anesthetic action. n2 o activity was examined in penk knockout mice. analgesia, sedation and hypnosis were maintained
in mutant animals, indicating that preproenkephalin-derived
peptides are not required (kingery et al., 2001).
5.3.4. naloxone
an endogenous opioid tone has been postulated to regulate hedonic homeostasis (koob and moal, 1997) and
the general opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to
produce conditioned place aversion in rodents. in order to
determine the contribution of mor activity in this phenomenon, the dysphoric effect of naloxone was tested in
the mor-deficient mutant (skoubis et al., 2001). naloxone
produced conditioned place aversion in wild-type animals,
but showed no activity in mutant mice, suggesting that
naloxone produces aversion by blocking an endogenous
mor tone and that this activity of mor normally acts to
improve hedonic status.

6. concluding remarks and perspectives
data using null mutant mice for genes encoding opioid
peptides or receptors have now provided important findings
on (i) the role of each component of the opioid system in
mouse physiology and (ii) the respective contributions of
mor, dor and kor in responses to exogenous opiates
in vivo. phenotyping these animals in the absence of drugs
has highlighted specific roles for receptors and peptides
in various pain modalities, emotional behaviors and stress
responses. the analysis of drug effects has definitely evidenced mor as being critical not only for opiate addiction
but also for responses to other drugs of abuse, while dor
and kor clearly remain interesting therapeutic targets for
analgesia.
many of the results are in line with our previous understanding of the opioid system. the findings complement
and strengthen data from the pharmacology by identifying the precise molecular players of the system in integrated responses in vivo. interestingly, novel hypotheses
have also emerged from the genetic approach. the observation of responses in dor-deficient mice opposing those of
mor-deficient mice in several behaviors, including locomotion, level of anxiety, depressive-like behavior or alcohol intake, was unexpected. together, the results suggest that many
aspects of  xxxg1632xxx  function deserve further exploration
and that the development of more selective delta compounds
certainly is worth the effort. the analysis of knockout animals, therefore, has not only confirmed previous pharmacology but has also opened new avenues of research.
some paradoxical findings have been described. examples are the naloxone-induced sia in the ␤end mutant
(rubinstein et al., 1996), increased bw37386 analgesia
in the dor-mutant (zhu et al., 1999), increased corticosterone levels in the mor mutant (roy et al., 2001), reduced
perception of chemical pain in mor (sora et al., 1999)
and penk (könig et al., 1996) mutants or decreased inflammatory pain in mor-deficient mice (qiu et al., 2000).
one possible explanation for those data is that adaptative
mechanisms have developed in mutant mice to compensate
for the absent gene, and are responsible for the unexpected
responses. although no major compensatory mechanism
could be observed as yet, it is likely that transcriptome-wide
analysis of the mutant mice as well as the induction of gene
knockout in the adult will clarify this issue in the future.
studies of each mutant of the opioid system are generally
performed in separate laboratories and parallel studies of
several mutants under the exact same experimental conditions have been rare (filliol et al., 2000; ghozland et al.,
2002; slowe et al., 2001). drawing general conclusions on
the role of specific receptor subtypes or receptor–peptide
systems from these independent studies is sometimes difficult. further, heterogeneity in the genetic backgrounds of
these animals complicates inter-study interpretations. the
data nevertheless suggest a mor/penk partnership in the
regulation of locomotion, sensitivity to thermal pain and

303

response to chemical pain, an involvement of dor/penk
genes in anxiety-related behaviors and a role for mor/␤end
in sia. in the future, it will be important to compare several
mutants, which ideally have been backcrossed similarly,
in parallel studies to get a comprehensive picture on the
activity of the opioid system.
finally, refinement of in vivo targeted mutagenesis techniques will allow to introduce point mutations that will modify, instead of inactivate, opioid receptor function (knockin)
or allow inactivation of opioid receptor or peptide genes in
a regional-specific manner (conditional knockout). much is
expected from these approaches to understand the molecular and anatomical basis of opioid-controlled nociceptive,
emotional and addictive behaviors.
