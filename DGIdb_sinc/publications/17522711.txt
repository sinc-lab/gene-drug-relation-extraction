schizophrenia is a strongly heritable disorder, and identification of potential candidate genes
has accelerated in recent years. genomewide scans have identified multiple large linkage
regions across the genome, with fine-mapping studies and other investigations of biologically
plausible targets demonstrating several promising candidate genes of modest effect. the
recent introduction of technological platforms for whole-genome association (wga) studies
can provide an opportunity to rapidly identify novel targets, although no wga studies have
been reported in the psychiatric literature to date. we report results of a case–control wga
study in schizophrenia, examining b500 000 markers, which revealed a strong effect
(p = 3.7  107) of a novel locus (rs4129148) near the  xxxg527xxx  (colony stimulating factor,
receptor 2 alpha) gene in the pseudoautosomal region. sequencing of  xxxg527xxx  and its
neighbor,  xxxg1178xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx  receptor alpha) in an independent case–control cohort revealed
both common intronic haplotypes and several novel, rare missense variants associated with
schizophrenia. the presence of cytokine receptor abnormalities in schizophrenia may help
explain prior epidemiologic data relating the risk for this illness to altered rates of autoimmune
disorders, prenatal infection and familial leukemia.

introduction
schizophrenia is a disease with estimated lifetime
morbid risk approaching 1% worldwide.1 its course is
commonly chronic and severely disabling, accounting
for nearly 3% of all years lived with disability;
amongst individuals aged 15–44, scz is the thirdleading cause of disability.2 schizophrenia (scz) is
associated with an increase of at least 50% in
mortality rates compared with the general population,3 including a suicide rate of approximately 5%,4
resulting in a 10-year average lifespan reduction.2
despite recent advances, pathophysiology remains
poorly understood, and current treatments remain
unsatisfactory.5
genetic epidemiologic studies have revealed high
heritability estimates (b80%) for schizophrenia and
elevated relative risk (l b10) in first-degree relatives.6

the discovery of susceptibility genes for scz has
proven challenging; however, research to date has
identified genes with, at best, modest individual
effects. as with other complex diseases, linkage
studies have revealed multiple candidate regions
with marginal lod scores spanning large regions of
the genome,7 whereas studies of individual candidate
genes are inherently limited in their scope and may
miss unexpected loci of strong effect. by contrast, the
development of whole-genome association (wga)
technology provides an opportunity to rapidly identify novel susceptibility genes for complex phenotypes, even with relatively small samples, as recently
demonstrated in macular degeneration,8,9 and qt
interval prolongation,10 for example. these wga
studies, which examined approximately 100 000
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), also demonstrated the importance of subsequent fine mapping and examination of independent cohorts in
clarifying and validating initial association signals
obtained with wga. because wga studies are
unlikely to directly reveal functional variants, our
goal in wga was to identify snps in or near genes
that could then be independently examined through

t lencz et al

deep sequencing. thus, we report the results of a
wga study in a schizophrenia case–control cohort
using a b500 000 snp array and data from exonic
sequencing in an independent case–control cohort.

materials and methods
the wga sample
for the wga study, patients with schizophreniaspectrum disorders (n = 178, including schizophrenia,
n = 158; schizoaffective disorder, n = 13; or schizophreniform disorder, n = 7) were recruited from the
inpatient and outpatient clinical services of the
zucker hillside hospital, a division of the north
shore–long island jewish health system. after
providing written informed consent, the structured
clinical interview for dsm-iv axis i disorders (scid,
version 2.0) was administered by trained raters.
information obtained from the scid was supplemented by a review of medical records and interviews
with family informants when possible; all diagnostic
information was compiled into a narrative case
summary and presented to a consensus diagnostic
committee, consisting of a minimum of three senior
faculty. healthy controls (n = 144) were recruited by
use of local newspaper advertisements, flyers and
community internet resources, and underwent initial
telephone screening to assess eligibility criteria. the
nonpatient scid (scid-np) was administered to
subjects who met eligibility criteria, to rule out the
presence of an axis i psychiatric disorder; a urine
toxicology screen for drug use and an assessment of
the subject’s family history of psychiatric disorders
were also performed. exclusion criteria included
(current or past) axis i psychiatric disorder, psychotropic drug treatment, substance abuse, a first-degree
family member with an axis i psychiatric disorder, or
the inability to provide written informed consent.
patients (65 female/113 male) and controls (63 f/81
m) did not significantly differ in sex distribution
(p > 0.05). all self-identified as caucasian, non-hispanic. population structure was tested by examination of 210 ancestry informative markers (aims).
aims included all snps on the array that passed
initial quality control procedures (described below)
and demonstrated a frequency difference of x0.5 in
comparisons between caucasian individuals and
asians or african-americans in publicly available
data from shriver and colleagues.11 two tests of
structure were performed, both of which indicated
no significant stratification. first, analysis with the
structure program12 confirmed that all subjects
were drawn from a single population; second,
comparison of cases and controls on allelic frequency
across the 210 aims revealed no differences beyond
those expected by chance.
the sequencing sample
the sample for the sequencing study was drawn from
a larger sample of 151 scz patients and healthy
subjects of various self-reported ethnicities who

provided written, informed consent. all 151 subjects
were genotyped at 67 aims and analyzed using the
structure program.12 the 71 cases (28 f/43 m)
and 31 controls (18 f/13 m) who were at least 90%
caucasian were used in the primary case–control
analysis; groups did not significantly differ on sex
distribution (p > 0.05). all cases were diagnosed with
schizophrenia and were drawn from a nationwide
population of clozapine-treated patients in the united
states as part of a study on clozapine-induced
agranulocytosis. as a secondary analysis, to provide
comparable sample sizes between groups, 41 additional healthy individuals of asian, hispanic or
native american ancestry were also examined.

whole-genome genotyping
for the wga study, genomic dna extracted from
whole blood was hybridized to two chips containing
b262 000 and b238 000 snps as per manufacturer’s
(affymetrix, santa clara, ca, usa) specifications.
for all preliminary steps (e.g. polymerase chain
reactions), patient and control samples were proportionally represented on each 96-well plate, so as to
avoid the potential confound of plate artifacts.
genotype calls were obtained using the bayesian
robust linear model with mahalanobis distance
classifier algorithm threshold at 0.5 applied to
batches of 100 samples. quality control procedures
followed several steps. first, samples that obtained
mean call rates < 90% across both chips (or < 85%
for a single chip) were rejected. mean call rate of
remaining samples (total n = 322) was 97%. twentytwo of these cases were successfully repeated, and
concordance of the two calls (reliability) for each snp
was evaluated. snps with > 1 discrepancy were
excluded from further analyses. concordance across
the remaining 454 699 snps exceeded 99%. an
additional 1526 snps with call rates < 0.85 across
all valid cases were excluded, as were 13 662 snps
not in hardy–weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.001) in the
control sample, yielding 439 511 snps available for
analysis.
whole-genome association statistical analysis
the primary analytic modality involved computation
of likelihood ratios (df = 1) for the best possible
genotypic split (e.g. recessive or dominant models)
for each snp, with the constraint that a minimum of
10 subjects populate each split group (thereby
excluding monomorphic and very rare snps), yielding 362 188 splits plotted in figure 1. allelic w2squares were also examined for each snp that passed
quality control procedures described above. all wga
statistical analyses were conducted using helixtree
5.0.2 software (golden helix, bozeman, mt, usa).
because strict bonferroni correction is considered
overly conservative, a bayesian formula was applied
to obtain x0.95 posterior probability of a correct
inference of association to a particular gene; this
approach was advocated by freimer and sabatti,13
and modified to take into account recent estimates of

order of chromosomal position (1–22, x). heavy reference line indicates threshold for genomewide significance
(p = 4.2  107). one snp (rs4129148) indicated with red arrow crosses this threshold (p = 3.7  107). thin reference line
indicates p-value of next highest snp (p = 2.8  106), separated by approximately one order of magnitude.

the total number of genes in the human genome to
approximately 20 000, resulting in a p-value threshold
of b4.2  107. this gene-wise approach is particularly applicable to the current study design, in which
the wga analysis is conducted with the assumption
that significant marker(s) are not themselves functional variants but rather indicate neighboring genetic
loci to be examined in greater detail. it could be
argued that this threshold is also overly conservative,
in that it assumes a single genetic locus and does not
take into account prior information (e.g. cytogenetic
and linkage data) that may provide greater likelihood
in particular regions of the genome. however, such
information is difficult to quantify13 and therefore
was not included in deriving the threshold. finally, it
should be noted that empirical testing of all 362 188
p-values from the primary analysis, using the q-value
program,14 yielded a false discovery rate q < 0.05 for
the threshold applied in the present study.
sequencing methods
as described below, wga data yielded an snp near
the  xxxg526xxx  receptor alpha
( xxxg527xxx ) gene which was examined in the independent sequencing sample (n = 102). notably, no hapmap data are available for  xxxg527xxx  to guide snp
selection; all snps analyzed in the sequencing sample
are derived from sequencing of exons and their
immediate flanking regions. because  xxxg527xxx  forms
a cytokine receptor gene cluster with its neighboring
gene ( xxxg1177xxx  receptor alpha;  xxxg1178xxx ), we also
examined sequencing data for  xxxg1178xxx  in the same 102
individuals. the following regions were sequenced:
 xxxg527xxx , exons 3, 7, 8, 9, 12 and an upstream region;
 xxxg1178xxx , exons 1–3, 5–8, 10 and 12 (reference genbank
mrna accession numbers nm_006140.3 and
nm_002183.2, respectively). fragments (500bp) were
amplified using primers displayed in table 1; note
that intronic regions flanking each exon were thus
included in the sequencing analysis. primers were
molecular psychiatry

tailed with m13f for forward primers and with m13r
for reverse primers. the sequencing reactions were
carried out in both directions using bigdye terminator cycle sequencing, and electrophoresis was run
on the abi prism 3700 dna analyzer, according to
standard procedures. fragments were blasted against
the target sequence and polymorphisms were scored
for fragments with an average phred score > 30. as a
control, mendelian inheritance of each common
polymorphism was assessed in one caucasian family
(four grandparents, two parents, four children) and
one african american family (two parents, five
children) and population specific hardy–weinberg
equilibrium was determined for 79 unrelated individuals.

results
wga results
as shown in figure 1, the wga study yielded one
snp demonstrating an association beyond the
genomewide significance threshold: rs4129148, neighboring  xxxg527xxx .  xxxg527xxx  is located in the pseudoautosomal region (par1) of the x and y chromosomes
(xp22.32/yp11.3). under a recessive genetic model,
homozygosity for the c allele (strand) was significantly associated with schizophrenia. as shown in
figure 2, 59% of cases (105/178), but only 31% of
controls (44/143, one subject not called) were
cc homozygotes (odds ratio = 3.23; 95% confidence
interval = 2.04–5.15; population attributable risk =
23.5%).
additional tests were performed to rule out several
potential confounds that might artifactually inflate
the p-value of rs4129148. first, as noted above, there
was no evidence of population stratification; the
maximal difference between cases and controls on
210 aims was more than four orders of magnitude
smaller than that observed for rs4129148. this
distinction is important insofar as the hapmap

figure 2 genotype frequencies for rs4129148 for patients
(scz) and controls from the wga study. note that alleles
are reported from the () strand.

reveals significant allelic frequency differences between populations for rs4129148. moreover, the
genotype and allelic frequencies in the wga control
sample are comparable to those reported in the
hapmap ceu sample, and neither cases nor controls
in the wga sample exhibit genotypic or allelic
frequencies comparable to the other hapmap ethnic
groups.

second, because rs4129148 is located on the x/y
chromosomes, case–control comparisons were performed separately for males and females. for both
sexes, the recessive model described above significantly differentiated cases and controls (pp0.001),
with comparable genotypic and allelic frequencies
across sexes. moreover, hardy–weinberg equilibrium
was observed in both sexes, and only one subject in
the entire sample was not called. thus, it was
unlikely that any sex difference in calling of alleles
or observation of heterozygosity could account for
the significant results for this pseudoautosomal (not
x-linked) snp.
third, by selecting amongst more than one genotypic model (i.e. dominant and recessive), it is
possible that p-values were artificially inflated.
therefore, we separately performed genomewide
allelic w2-tests, which again demonstrated that
rs4129148 achieved the strongest p-value, with
virtually the same strength (p = 4.4  107) as the
genotypic p-value for the recessive model. moreover,
examination of the distribution of p-values for all
allelic tests across the genome demonstrated no
excess of significant results. examining all 439 511

snps that passed quality control procedures, 44
crossed a significance threshold of p < 0.0001, 429
were significant at p < 0.001, and 4346 were significant at p < 0.01; these results demonstrate no inflation
of the family-wise error rate.
sequencing results
next, we sought to extend the wga finding by
conducting two sets of analyses in the sequencing
sample: (1) haplotype analysis of common snps
(minor allele frequencyx0.10); and (2) frequency
analysis of all rare missense variants. common snps
were examined using haploview 3.3215 for patterns of
linkage disequilibrium (ld) and identification of
haplotype blocks. figure 3 demonstrates the patterns
of ld for common variants in  xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx .
three haplotype blocks were identified with solid
spines of d 0 > 0.70.

our case–control analysis followed a hierarchical
approach, to limit multiple testing concerns. first,
we performed global w2-tests for each of the three
haplotype blocks, controlling overall alpha at 0.05
using the false discovery rate method of benjamini
and hochberg.16 for each significant haplotype block,
we then conducted planned post hoc analyses to
determine which haplotypes (and snps) within the
block were accounting for the signal. haplotype block
1, consisting of three common snps in  xxxg527xxx 
intron 8, was significantly associated with schizophrenia (global p = 0.016, table 2). as shown in table
2, the cgc haplotype within this block was significantly under-represented in patients (p = 0.0017), and
two snps in the block were individually associated
with scz (rs28694718, p = 0.0175; rs28414810,
p = 0.0084). haplotype block 2, containing three
snps spanning introns 4, 5 and 6 of  xxxg1178xxx , was also

d0 but low r2-values. three haplotype blocks are also shown. note that the upper portion of the figure (white background) is

genotyped in the sequencing study are listed in the lower (gray background) portion of the figure.

controls (fisher’s exact p = 0.031). moreover, all but
one of the rare missense variants shown in table 3
were observed in patients without agranulocytosis,
again indicating that these results are not a reflection
of susceptibility to agranulocytosis. finally, because it
could be argued that the control group sample size
was too small for adequate comparison of rare events,
we obtained sequence data from an additional 41
healthy individuals of asian, hispanic or native
american ancestry, resulting in total sample size
(n = 72 controls) directly comparable to the patient
group. notably, six of the seven rare missense alleles
listed in table 3 were not detected in any of these
healthy individuals. moreover, the rare allele of the
other mutation locus (ala17gly) was detected in only

significantly associated with illness (global p = 0.027).
a haplotype containing the minor alleles of these
snps (cgc for rs6422441, rs6603272 and rs17883192)
was over-represented in patients (p = 0.0086), and
each of these snps was significantly associated with
scz (p’s < 0.05). of note, when patients who had
developed agranulocytosis while undergoing treatment with clozapine (n = 26) were removed from the
analysis, haplotype comparisons of scz patients vs
controls remained significant (cgc in  xxxg527xxx ,
p = 1  104; cgc in  xxxg1178xxx , p = 0.02).
we also identified seven novel exonic mutations
within these two genes that resulted in amino acid
substitutions (table 3). a total of 15 substitutions
were detected in cases, with only one detected in

three of the additional control subjects. no additional
mutations were detected in the additional subjects.
thus, the rate of mutation was four times higher in
patients than in the combined control sample, and the
results remain statistically significant (p = 0.01).
using similar methods, we also sequenced a small
region surrounding rs4129148 in the original 102
caucasian individuals. there were no significant
differences in rs4129148 genotype (p = 0.28) or allele
(p = 0.14) frequency between patients and controls in
this sample. evidence for long-range ld between
rs4129148 and the genic snps in  xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx 
in the sequenced cohort was present, though limited.
in the control sample, there was modest evidence of
ld between rs4129148 and snps in haplotype block 2
(d 0 = 0.5, r2 = 0.12), which was not observed in the
patient group. in both samples, there was some
evidence of strong ld (d0 as high as 1, but with
modest r2) between rs4129148 and several snps with
low minor allele frequency (0.05 < maf < 0.10) within
the two genes. it should be noted that these relationships could not be tested in the wga sample, because
the affymetrix 500k array has very limited coverage
of the par1; there are no snps on the array within
 xxxg527xxx , and only two snps within  xxxg1178xxx , neither of
which passed quality control screens.

discussion
this study identified three converging lines of
evidence, from two independent samples, suggesting
the presence of a novel schizophrenia susceptibility
locus in the par1. first, an snp neighboring  xxxg527xxx 
survived a genomewide test of significance in the
wga sample, with an odds ratio greater than 3 and a
population-attributable risk approaching 25%. second, intronic haplotype blocks within  xxxg527xxx  and
its immediate neighbor  xxxg1178xxx  were significantly
associated with scz in the independent sequencing
sample. third, seven novel missense mutations in
these two genes were also significantly over-represented in patients with schizophrenia in the sequencing sample.
whereas there is some prior cytogenetic support for
a par1 locus,17 linkage studies have reported mixed
results18–20 and have often not included coverage of
the par1 region. to our knowledge, neither  xxxg527xxx 
nor  xxxg1178xxx  have been previously examined in candidate gene association studies of schizophrenia,
and studies of other cytokine genes in schizophrenia
have been equivocal. intriguingly, a very recent study
has identified several schizophrenia-related snps
and haplotypes both in and near the gene for
 xxxg1177xxx  (the ligand for  xxxg1178xxx ), which is located
within a commonly identified linkage peak on
chromosome 5q.21
results of the present study are also notable in
that associations to illness were found for common
variants in non-coding regions as well as rare
missense mutations. whereas hereditary patterns
and linkage data in schizophrenia are consistent

model,22 it has also been suggested that heterogeneous
rare mutations may play an important role.23 results
of the present study suggest that these mechanisms
are not mutually exclusive in the genetics of
schizophrenia.
a substantial role for cytokine-related genes such as
 xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx  in mediating schizophrenia risk
might help connect several disparate lines of epidemiologic and biological data in scz. first, it has long
been observed that monozygotic twin concordance is
approximately 50%, indicating both strong genetic
and environmental components of risk.6 well-replicated findings of increased scz risk for winter-born
and urban-born/dwelling individuals, combined with
large-scale studies demonstrating increased risk following maternal exposure to a variety of infectious
pathogens, have suggested that prenatal infection may
represent a significant environmental risk factor.24
the lack of specificity to particular teratogens,
including perinatal hypoxic insult or trauma as well
as maternal stress, points to a common pathway by
which these varying exposures may equally influence
schizophrenia liability; one such pathway is the
cytokine-mediated inflammatory response.25 moreover, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines
reported in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal
fluid of patients with schizophrenia suggest that
activation of this pathway in adulthood may form a
component of scz pathophysiology.26 furthermore,
family-based epidemiologic studies suggest that relatives of patients with schizophrenia are psychiatrically27 and neuroanatomically28 more sensitive to
negative sequelae of teratogenic exposures. the
present findings point toward an explanation for
such gene–environment interactions: genetic variation in the receptor structure or expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as  xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx 
and their respective ligands, granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) and  xxxg1177xxx 
( xxxg1177xxx ), may serve to heighten sensitivity to the
teratogenic effects of prenatal infections and perinatal
insults,29 and may contribute to the variable course
and episodic nature of the adult disorder.30
abnormalities of gm-csf,  xxxg1177xxx  and their receptors
have been most commonly associated with lymphoma
and leukemia.31,32 a previously unexplained (though
replicated) epidemiologic finding in schizophrenia
has been the reduced incidence of these two cancers
in relatives of scz patients.33,34 similarly, an elevated
level of gm-csf in synovial fluid has been implicated
in the inflammatory pathophysiology of rheumatoid
arthritis (ra),35 and scz patients have consistently
demonstrated a reduced prevalence of ra.36 moreover, scz patients show increased incidence of
other inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as
celiac disease and sjögren’s syndrome before scz
onset, and prevalence of many autoimmune disorders
is increased in parents of scz patients.36 these
patterns of comorbidity, both in patients and
first-degree relatives, might also be explained by

pseudoautosomal locus in schizophrenia
t lencz et al

gene–environment interactions of abnormal cytokine
receptor genes and varying levels of environmental
exposures.
finally, whereas gm-csf is most commonly associated with proliferation and differentiation of granulocytes and macrophages, there is accumulating
evidence of its critical role in the central nervous
system repair via expression of brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx ,37 a trophic factor that has been
associated with psychiatric illness. this is consistent
with broader evidence of a role for gm-csf and  xxxg1177xxx 
in the central nervous system, including neuroprotection,38 communication across the blood–brain barrier,39 and neurotransmitter modulation (particularly
of acetylcholine and gaba levels).40 further studies
are needed to determine whether the association of
this cytokine receptor genetic locus with schizophrenia is mediated by immune response to infectious
agents, autoimmune or inflammatory processes,
trophic factors or a combination of these mechanisms.
as with any genetic association study, additional
independent replications from other laboratories will
be critical to confirm these novel findings. the lack of
significant association to rs4129148 in the small
sequencing cohort provides a note of caution in
interpreting results of the wga study. nevertheless,
the genomewide-significant result of the wga study
appeared robust to several potential forms of artifact,
including population stratification and gender bias.
notably, rs4129148 showed zero errors in the reproducibility analysis, and had a high minor allele
frequency resulting in apparently robust calling of
both heterozygotes and homozygotes. still, it is
important to note that even multiply replicated
findings can be subject to subsequent failures to
replicate,41–44 presumably owing to the multiple
sources of heterogeneity underlying the pathophysiology of complex disease.
understanding the role of rs4129148 will require
further explication of its relationship to the neighboring genes  xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx . whereas the sequencing sample demonstrated only modest evidence
of long-range ld, difficulties in sequencing and
genotyping this region (as demonstrated by gaps in
coverage in the reference sequence,45 the hapmap,46
and commercially available arrays such as the
affymetrix 500k) limit our current understanding
of the ld structure in this region. other roles of
rs4129148 distinct from any potential relationship
to  xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx , such as regulatory functions
or coding of small rnas, cannot be ruled out at this
time. additionally, it should be noted that an
additional cytokine receptor gene, cytokine receptorlike factor 2 (crlf2), may lie between rs4129148 and
 xxxg527xxx , although its refseq status is currently listed
as provisional.
despite these limitations, the design of the present
study did permit the wga result to direct attention
to par1. the sequencing study identified two
common haplotypes in  xxxg527xxx  and  xxxg1178xxx  that were
significantly associated with schizophrenia; we also

identified seven previously unreported missense
mutations, which were collectively associated with
illness. future biological studies will be needed to
explicate potential consequences of these haplotypes
and amino acid substitutions on receptor transcription, structure and function.
