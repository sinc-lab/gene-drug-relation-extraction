abstract.  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos) shows similarities to cytochrome p-450 reductase. the two enzymes catalyze the oxidation of n-w-hydroxy-l-arginine by nadph
and oxygen to  xxxd2738xxx  (no) and citruliine.  xxxd2738xxx  synthase activity is inhibited
by l-arginine analogs like n-w-nitro-l-arginine, which does not affect cytochrome
p-450 reductase. dihydroergotamine,  xxxd2640xxx , and troleandomycin are classical
inhibitors of cytochrome. the present study shows the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of these compounds and of l- but not  xxxd2589xxx -o-nitro-arginine on the
activity of constitutive  xxxd2738xxx  synthase from bovine aortic endothelial cells. activity of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase was estimated by measurement of conversion of
[3h]arginineto [3h]citrulline. the tested cytochrome p-450 inhibitors are likely to interfere with heme of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase. the data confirms a similarity as well as
functional differences between the enzymes.

itric oxide (no) acts as a signal molecule in
cardiovascular and central nervous systems
with soluble  xxxg1587xxx  as an effector
enzyme (1, 2). no is also formed by cytokineactivated cells of the immune system and mediates the
cytotoxicity of these cells (3). several isoforms of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos), which catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to no plus  xxxd2429xxx  (4), have
been identified. the intracellular ca2 and calmodulin-dependent isoforms of nos are constitutively expressed in endothelial cells (3,brain (6), platelets (7),
adrenal gland (8), and lung (9). ca2 independent, cytokine- xxxg1578xxx  has been purified from

dependent on ca2+ but not on calmodulin, has been
obtained from neutrophiles (1 1).
the constitutive and inducible no synthases have
similar catalytic properties (12). both require
nadph, tetrahydrobiopterin, and molecular oxygen
as cofactors and contain fad and fmn (1, 6, 13).
cytochrome p-450 reductase is the only known mammalian enzyme with close homology to nos (13, 14).
similar to nos (15), this enzyme is also known to
catalyze the oxidation of n-o-hydroxy-l-arginine to
no and  xxxd2429xxx . cytochrome p-450 and cytochrome p-450 reductase are major components of
the hepatic cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase system
embedded in the lipid bilayer of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
the present study demonstrates that  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase from freshly harvested endothelial cells is inhibited by classical inhibitors of hepatic cytochrome
p-450 such as  xxxd2640xxx , dihydroergotamine (dhe),
and troleandomycin (tao). we also confirmed that
nos was inhibited by n-o-nitro-l-arginine, a compound which failed to affect cytochrome p-450 activity
(15).  xxxd2640xxx , dhe, and tao are used in clinical
pharmacology as anti-mycotic, anti-migraine, and antibacterial agents, and have chemical structures (imid-

azole, ergopeptide, and macrocyclic lactone antibiotic, respectively) that are unrelated to each other. however, the above substances do share some properties:
together with o2 and co they are inhibitors of cytochrome p-450,  xxxg590xxx  isoforms (16). moreover, all
of the inhibitors are likely to interfere with heme binding, and since both cytochrome p-450 reductase and
nos are hemoproteins (14), this formulates the basis
for the selection of the test compounds. the results
confirm a close similarity between  xxxd2738xxx  synthase and cytochrome p-450 reductase despite functional differences between the two proteins.

materials and methods
materials. [3h]arginine (57 ci/mmol; 1 ci = 37
gbq) was obtained from amersham (arlington
heights, il). all other chemicals were obtained from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
endothelial cells. the preparation of endothelial
cells has been previously described (17). in brief, six
bovine aortas were obtained from a local abattoir and
transported to the laboratory on ice. after removing
the surrounding connective tissue, the aortic branches
were occluded with titanium hemostatic clips (pilling
co., fort washington, pa) and with edslab parallel
jaw spring clips (baxter healthcare corp., irvine,
ca). the aortic lumina was filled with 0.1% collagenase, type 1, dissolved in krebs-henseleit solution (kh), prewarmed to 37°c and incubated for 45 min. the
krebs-henseleit solution was composed of the following substances: 1.2 mm h,p042-, 127.8 mm c1-, 143
m m n a + , 5.9 mm k + , 2.5 mmca2+, 1.2 mmmg2+,
25 mm hco,- , 1.2 mm s 0 2 - , 10 mm glucose. after
incubation, the vessels were cut lengthwise and rinsed
twice by gentle irrigation with k-h. the intimal surface was then delicately scraped with a rubber policeman to detach endothelial cells and further irrigated
with k-h, which was collected into 50 ml capacity
polypropelene centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10
min at 1600 rpm. cells were finally suspended in 1 ml
of k-h solution and then divided into aliquots.
counting of endothelial cells. one hundred microliters of the cell suspension were incubated for 3
min with tripan blue (final concentration 0.08%) and
the viable cells were counted. viability was approximately 90%.
measurement of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase activity.
no synthase activity was determined in both cell homogenates and intact endothelial cells by measuring
the conversion of [3h]arginine to [,h]citrulline (6).
homogenized cells. approximately 30 million
freshly harvested endothelial cells were homogenized
in 1 ml of  xxxd3449xxx  (0.05 m , ph 7.4) containing
edta (0.1 mm), dithiothreitol(o.5 mm), leupeptin (10
pg/ml),  xxxd2936xxx  (25 pg/ml), and aprotinin (100
pg/ml). the samples were sonicated for 20 sec (bio-

sonik i11 apparatus; bronwill scientific inc., rochester, ny). one hundred-microliter aliquots of the homogenates were incubated in 1.5-ml eppendorf test
tubes and shaken in a water bath at 37°c for 5 min.
each sample contained calmodulin (100 u), nadph
(1 mm), and  xxxg2125xxx , (2 mm). if required, n-o-nitro-larginine (l-nna, 0.1 pm-1 mm), dihydroergotamine
(dhe, 1-100 pm),  xxxd2640xxx  (1-100 pm), troleandomycin (tao, 5-50 pm) or n-o-nitro- xxxd862xxx  (dnna, 0.1 pm-1 pm) was added (all concentrations
final). dhe,  xxxd2640xxx , and tao were added at concentrations known to inhibit cytochrome p-450 reductase (15). dhe and  xxxd2640xxx  were dissolved in dimethylosulfoxide, and the final concentration of dmso
was maintained below 1% (15). after 5 min, [3h]arginine was added to a final concentration of 3.0 pwml
(50 nm). the reaction was stopped after 30 min by
addition of 1 ml ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx , ph 5.5 containing
edta (2 mm). separation of radiolabeled citrulline
from arginine was performed by cation exchange chromatography. dowex 5owx-8, 100-200 mesh na+
resin (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca), packed
into disposable polypropelene 1o-ml chromatography
columns (pierce, rockford, il) was used. radioactivity of the sample was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (beckman ls 100 sc, irvine ca) and
expressed as the percentage of net cpm count (basal
activity equals 100%). the amount of [3h]arginine
added to each sample corresponded with approximately 100,000 cpm, and the representative basal
sample had 8,000 to 10,000 cpm derived from
[3h]~itrulline.the nonspecific background was below
600 cpm. approximately 3.74.7 fmol of arginine was
converted to citrulline within 10 min in the basal
sample.
intact cells. aliquots of 70 pl (3.0 million cells)
were placed in eppendorf tubes (1.5 ml capacity) with
or without the inhibitors of d-nna (0.1 mm). after 10
min of initial incubation in a shaking water bath at
37"c, 10 pl of [3h]argininewas added (3.0 pci/ml, 50
nm final). after 60 min, samples were removed from
the water bath, placed on ice and 1 ml of ice-cold tris
buffer (0.05 m , ph 5.5) containing 2 mm of edta was
added. the samples were sonicated for 10 sec. thereafter, the same procedure previously described was
followed.
statistics. data are expressed as mean
sem.
student's t test was used to analyze the data for significant differences. the differences were considered
significant when p < 0.05 (two-tailed).

hibitory effect of l-nna was absent at concentrations
0.1 p m and lower; maximal effect was observed at 0.1
mm and ecs0 was 3.1 pa4 (fig. 1). all three cytochrome p-450 reductase inhibitors, dhe (1-100
pa4),  xxxd2640xxx  (1-100 pm), and tao (5-50 pm),
significantly lowered nos activity in cell homogenates; the inhibition was concentration dependent
(fig. 1). at the highest used concentrations, dhe,
 xxxd2640xxx , and tao respectively produced 43.1%
4.2%, 44.0% 2 5.2%, and 26.3% & 4.9% of inhibition
(fig. 1). the compounds could not be used in higher
concentration because of their weak solubility. compared with l-nna, all three concentration-dependent
curves were shifted to the right, showing a lower potency for dhe,  xxxd2640xxx  and tao; their potencies
were similar (fig. 1). the efficacy of l-nna was also
higher than other inhibitors. compared with l-nna,
dhe,  xxxd2640xxx , and tao appeared as partial inhibitors of nos.
with the exception of  xxxd2640xxx  (0.1 mm), in
intact endothelial cells, l-nna (0.1 mm), dhe (0.05
mm), and tao (0.05 mm) showed a significant inhibitory effect on nos (32.9% 2 4.4%, 70.6% 2 6.4%,
66.4% 2 6.2% and 91.0% ? 18.9% of basal activity,
respectively, fig. 2). d-nna showed no effect (107.8
2 6.4%, fig. 2).
the enzymes  xxxd2738xxx  synthase and cytochrome p-450 reductase have some properties in
common (12). the two proteins have an amino acid
sequence that is 36% identical and 58% of the sequence reveals a close homology (13). both are  xxxd135xxx -

proteins, containing 1 mol each of fad and fmn,
tetrahydrobiopterin, and iron (18). recent evidences
demonstrate a p-450-type co-binding heme prosthetic
group in purified nos (14, 18). the conclusion that
nos was the first example of mammalian soluble isoform of cytochrome p-450 reductase (19) containing
both a reductase and a heme domain on the same polypeptide was reached (14).
several analogs of l-arginine, which is a substrate
for nos, have been shown to be competitive inhibitors of nos (20). when n-o-methyl- or n-o-nitro-larginine are present, there is no conversion of l-arginine to n-o-hydroxy-l-arginine (2 1) and subsequent
to  xxxd2429xxx  and no by nos. cytochrome p-450
reductase also catalyzes the oxidation of n-ohydroxy-l-arginine by nadph and o2 to no and citrulline. this reaction is strongly inhibited by classical
inhibitors of cytochrome p-450 such as co,  xxxd2640xxx , dihydroergotamine, and troleandomycin, but not
by n-o-methyl- and n-o-nitro-l-arginine (15). although  xxxd2640xxx , dhe, and tao have different
chemical structures, they all inhibit cytochrome p-450,
 xxxg590xxx  isoforms (16) by interfering with heme binding. imidazole-related compounds have high selectivity for cytochrome heme moiety (22), and imidazole
acts as a heme-site inhibitor of brain nos (23). dihydroergotamine interacts with cytochrome p-450 from
microsomes and binds to a protein site close to the
heme (24). macrolide antibiotics, including troleandomycin, also exhibits a high affinity for cytochrome as
shown by difference visible spectroscopy (25, 26).

mm),  xxxd2640xxx  (0.1 mm), and troleandomycin (tao, 0.05 mm) on the  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (nos) activity in intact endothelial cells
(n = 12 separate experiments for each column). l-nna inhibited nos to 32.9% 2 4.4% of basal (p < o.oool), whereas d-nna had no
effect (107.8% 2 6.4%, ns). dhe and tao significantly inhibited nos activity to 70.6% 2 6.4% (p < 0.005) and 66.4% 2 6.2% (p <
0.001) respectively, but  xxxd2640xxx  showed no significant effect (91.0% 2 18.9%, ns). basal activity equals 100% of net cpm.

in the present study, it has been shown that, in
case of constitutive bovine endothelial  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase, the enzyme is inhibited by both classical
nos and classical cytochrome p-450 inhibitors. since
 xxxd2640xxx , dhe, and tao interfere with heme binding, and because nos is a hemoprotein, similar mechanisms seem to be responsible for the inhibition of
 xxxg1579xxx  by these compounds. the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2640xxx  on the  xxxd2429xxx -forming activity of constitutive brain nos has been previously reported, demonstrating that enzyme-bound heme is involved in no synthesis (23). although the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2640xxx , dhe, and tao was not as potent as l-nna, it remained significant. in intact cells,
however,  xxxd2640xxx  demonstrated no significant inhibition. the reason is not completely clear. imidazole
antimycotics, including  xxxd2640xxx , possess a number
of pharmacological properties. for example, they interfere with ca2+ influx into cells (27). since  xxxg1579xxx  is a calcium-dependent enzyme, the effect of
 xxxd2640xxx  should be even more pronounced in intact
cells.  xxxd2640xxx  has been shown to be effective in
cell systems, and its permeability is probably no less
than that of the other inhibitors. on the basis of the
presented data, we are unable to explain the failure of
 xxxd2640xxx  to inhibit nos in intact endothelial cells.
d-isomer of nna had no effect on nos activity.
this data is in agreement with other findings on
close homology and similarity between  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase and cytochrome p-450 reductase. however,
the present results, together with the observations

made by others (15), show the functional difference
between cytochrome p-450 reductase and endothelial
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase: nos but not cytochrome p-450
reductase is inhibited by l-arginine analogs. the pharmacological relevance of inhibition of nos by dhe,
 xxxd2640xxx , and tao cannot be established on the
basis of presented data.
