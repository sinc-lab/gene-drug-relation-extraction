abstract: receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (tks) have emerged as clinically useful drug target
molecules for treating gastrointestinal cancer.  xxxd2333xxx  ( xxxd2332xxx   xxxd2333xxx , gleevectm), an inhibitior of bcr-abl
tk, which was primarily designed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia is also an inhibitor of c-kit receptor tk,
and is currently the drug of choice for the therapy of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists), which
frequently express constitutively activated forms of the c-kit-receptor. the  xxxg682xxx 
(egfr), which is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, is another important target. the
two main classes of egfr inhibitors are the tk inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. gefitinib ( xxxd2186xxx ,
iressatm) has been on trial for esophageal and colorectal cancer (crc) and  xxxd2029xxx  ( xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx , tarcevatm) on
trial for esophageal, colorectal, hepatocellular, and biliary carcinoma. in addition,  xxxd2029xxx  has been evaluated
in a phase iii study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. cetuximab (imc- xxxd467xxx , erbituxtm), a monoclonal
egfr antibody, has been fda approved for the therapy of irinotecan resistant colorectal cancer and has been
tested for pancreatic cancer.  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) and its receptor (vegfr) are critical
regulators of tumor angiogenesis. bevacizumab (avastintm), a monoclonal antibody against vegf, was
efficient in two randomized clinical trials investigating the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. it is also
currently investigated for the therapy of pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. other promising
new drugs currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation, are  xxxg1274xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3496xxx ,
 xxxd3342xxx , farnesyl transferase inhibitor  xxxd3381xxx  ( xxxd3381xxx , zarnestratm), matrix metalloproteinase
inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (velcadetm),  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor) inhibitors,
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors, platelet derived growth factor receptor (pdgf-r) inhibitors, protein
kinase c (pkc) inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) 1/2 inhibitors, rous sarcoma virus
transforming oncogene (src) kinase inhibitors, histondeacetylase (hdac) inhibitors, small hypoxiainducible factor (hif) inhibitors, aurora kinase inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, and tgf-beta signalling
inhibitors.

introduction
phosphorylation is the most common biochemical
modification of cellular molecules, regulating fundamental
cellular processes like cell proliferation, cell survival, growth
differentiation, cell movement, angiogenesis, as well as cell
death. protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer
of orthophosphatate residues (po3- ) from adenosin-5`triphosphate (atp) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine
residues on signal transduction molecules [1]. based on their
substrate specificity, protein kinases are classified as
serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. it is now widely
accepted that protein kinases are functionally involved in
human cancer. this was first discovered through studies of
animal tumor viruses and the subsequent identification of the
viral oncogenes v-src and  xxxg23xxx  as protein tyrosine kinases
[2, 3].
in tumor cells, it is common that key tyrosine kinases
are no longer adequately controlled, and excessive
phosphorylation sustains signal transduction pathways in an
activated state. as a result of the human genome project, it
is assumed that more than 1,000 such protein kinases are

coded by the human genome, however so far only 90 have
been identified [4]. receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) are
membrane bound proteins consisting of a ligand-binding
domain at the extracellular surface, a single transmembrane
segment, and a cytoplasmic part harboring the protein
 xxxg2198xxx  activity. with the exception of the insulin
receptor family of rtks, all known rtks form monomers
in the cell membrane. ligand-induced dimerization,
resulting in autophosphorylation of their cytoplasmic
domains, is the major mode of activation of rtks.
many oncogenic mutations in rtks involve either point
mutations leading to constitutive dimerization of the
receptors or translocations causing fusion of oligomerization
motifs to rtks. over-expression, probably caused by
mutations in gene regulatory sequences or gene
amplification, may lead to constitutive dimerization of
rtks. moreover, mislocalization of rtks due to fusion to
other proteins may contribute to their oncogenic phenotype.
phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the receptor tails then
function as recruitment sites for downstream signalling
proteins containing  xxxd1075xxx -recognition domains,
such as the src homology 2 (sh2) domain or the
 xxxd1075xxx -binding (ptb) domain.
these molecules act as relay points for a complex
network of independent signalling molecules that ultimately

affect gene transcription within the nucleus (fig. (1)). in
contrast, non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases are
cytoplasmic and, in some cases, also nuclear enzymes that
often associate with receptors lacking intrinsic protein kinase
activities (cytokine receptors, t-/b-cell receptors). abelson
leukemia virus (abl),  xxxg1220xxx  (jak2), and rous
sarcoma virus transforming oncogene (src) are non-receptor
protein tyrosine kinases involved in human cancer. overexpression of the src has been demonstrated in human
colon and pancratic cancer [5-7]. in contrast to protein
tyrosine kinases, some serine/threonine protein kinases have
been identified as tumor suppressor genes. when mutated
inactive, cancer development is no longer hindered. the
clinical development of targeted  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors

wiedmann and caca

represents a breakthrough for cancer treatment. they are
designed to take advantage of the molecular differences
specific to tumor cells compared with normal tissues. the
goal is to achieve tumor responses with better safety profiles
than those associated with cytotoxic chemotherapies which
exhibit narrow therapeutic indices and little selectivity for
cancer cells over normal proliferating cells.
targeting the c-kit receptor (c-kit-r)
c-kit-r (cd-117) signalling transduction
c-kit-r (cd-117) is a transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx 
receptor in which the extracellular protein binds a ligand
known as stem-cell factor (also known as steel factor) and

fig. (1). receptor  xxxg2198xxx  (rtk) signalling transduction. ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and
autophosphorylation, creating docking sites for adaptor molecules, leading to the activation of downstream effector molecules. a
variety of signalling pathways result in pleiotropic effects, including cell proliferation, control of cell cycle, regulation of apoptosis
and survival, and alterations in cell migration and invasiveness.

molecularly targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer

the intracellular portion contains the actual kinase enzymatic
domain [8-10]. c-kit-r is similar in structure to several other
rtks with oncogenic activity, including platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (pdgf-r) a and b, colony
stimulating factor 1 receptor (csf 1-r), and fms-related
 xxxg2198xxx  3 receptor ( xxxg801xxx -r). c-kit-r is expressed at
high levels in hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells,
melanocytic cells, germ cells, and the interstitial cells of
cajal (icc) [11-14]. the receptor forms homodimers upon
ligand binding leading to receptor activation. this triggers
activation of critical downstream signalling pathways, such

(mapkk)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) (cell
proliferation) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3k)/akt (cell survival) (fig. (1)) [15, 16]. there are receptor
activating oncogenic c-kit-r mutations, which involve the
extracellular (exon 9), juxtamembrane (exon 11) and kinase
domains (exons 13 and 17). as a consequence, in
hematologic neoplasms, the exact signalling pathways
activated by the mutant c-kit-r differ from those activated by
normal c-kit-r [17, 18].

c-kit-r inhbition
gleevectm,

 xxxd2333xxx  ( xxxd2332xxx   xxxd2333xxx ,
novartis), a 2phenylaminopyrimidine (fig. (2)) was primarily designed to
treat chronic myeloid leukemia by inhibiting bcr-abl fusion
protein, created by the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation,
which generates the distinctive philadelphia (ph)
chromosome. however,  xxxd2333xxx  is not a specific
bcr-abl inhibitor, its action extends to c-abl receptor, pdgfr, and c-kit-r [19]. moreover, it promotes nk cell
activation [20]. therefore,  xxxd2333xxx  has been
evaluated for the therapy of gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(gists), because most of them characteristically show c-kitr over-expression.
gists are rare tumors of the wall of the stomach and
small bowel, and also occasionally arise in the mesentery,
omentum or retroperitoneum. the tumors often present late
in their clinical course unless they are the cause of
gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. surgical resection is
the standard of care for primary gists. however, there is a
high risk of recurrence in the peritoneum and liver. for
metastatic gists,  xxxd2333xxx  treatment is currently
the therapeutical standard, based on a phase ii study,
including 147 patients with unresectable gists, which
reported a partial response rate of 54% and a rate of stable
disease of 28% [21] (table 1). another japanese phase ii

study, presented at the asco 2004 meeting, confirmed
these results1 (table 1).
adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with  xxxd2333xxx 
is the topic of at least three studies through the american
college of surgeons oncology group, the radiation
therapy oncology group, and the american college of
radiology imaging network. drug-related adverse effectsof
 xxxd2333xxx  include nausea, vomiting, myalgias,
edema, diarrhea, and, less commonly, anemia,
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and myelosuppression [2224].
gists frequently express permanently activation forms of
the c-kit-r which correlates with response to imatinib
mesilate, thus patients with activating c-kit-r mutations in
exon 11 (the most common mutation) had a partial response
of almost 80%, in contrast to a reponse rate of 18% for
patients with wild-type c-kit-r [25, 26]. examination of
tumors from patients with wild-type c-kit-r expression
showed that one third of these tumors had activating
mutations of the pdgf-r gene. these mutations occurred
in two different exons. one set of mutations was imatinib
mesilate sensitive and this accounted for the responses

observed in patients whose tumors express wild-type c-kit-r
[27]. a recently published phase iii study investigated the
dose dependency of response and progression-free survival
with  xxxd2333xxx  for metastatic gists [28] (table 1).
946 patients were randomly allocated imatinib 400 mg either
once or twice a day. those assigned the once a day regimen
who had progression were offered the option of crossover.
the primary endpoint was progression-free survival.
analysis was by intention to treat. at median follow-up of
760 days, 263 (56%) of 473 patients allocated imatinib
mesilate once a day had progressed compared with 235
(50%) of 473 who were assigned treatment twice a day (p =
0.026). side-effects occured in 465/470 (99%) patients
allocated the once daily regimen compared with 468/472
(99%) assigned to the twice-daily treatment. by comparison
with the group treated once a day, more dose reductions (77
[16%] vs. 282 [60%]) and treatment interruptions (189 [40%]
vs. 302 [64%]) were recorded in patients allocated the twicedaily regimen, but treatment in both arms was fairly well
tolerated. fifty-two patients (5%) achieved a complete
response, 442 (47%) a partial response, and 300 patients
(32%) had stable disease, with no difference between groups.
median time to best response was 107 days. the authors
conclude that, if response induction is the only aim of
treatment, a daily dose of 400 mg of imatinib is sufficient;
however, a dose of 400 mg twice a day achieves significantly
longer progression-free survival.
there are only a few published phase i and ii studies
investigating the effect of  xxxd2333xxx  on
gastrointestinal tumors other than gists. whereas two
studies detected a modest level of biological effect of
imatinib in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and carcinoid
tumor, there was no effect for the treatment of pancreatic
carcinoma2,3 [29] (table 1). resistance to  xxxd2333xxx 
can develop through several mechanisms, the most common
of them being point mutation in the kinase domain of target
receptors that either increase the expression or induce
reactivation of rtk activity [30]. genomic amplification of
c-kit-r and pdgf-r
genes is an alternative cause of
resistance to the drug [31].
 xxxd2642xxx  (novartis), an alternative inhibitor of c-kit-r
and pdgf-r alpha, has shown an inhibitory effect against
imatinib resistant gists and is currently under investigation
in a phase ii study in patients with imatinib resistant
gists. this is also true for  xxxd3264xxx  (sugen), an oral
multi-targeted rtk inhibitor (see below).

and  xxxg723xxx  (or  xxxg682xxx -4). when activated, the different
receptors form either homo-or heterodimers. egfr activity
plays a key role in numerous processes that affect tumor
growth
and
progression,
including
proliferation,
dedifferentiation, inhibition of apoptosis, metastasis, and
angiogenesis. abnormally elevated egfr activity is
associated with the most common gastrointestinal tumors,
including colorectal carcinoma, gastric, and pancreatic cancer
[33]. however, since a tumor may express additional
tyrosine kinases, such as ras, that are over-expressed or
genetically mutated and are capable of activating downstream
signalling, there may not be a direct correlation between
egfr expression and tumor response. in addition, egfr
activating mutations that are frequently found in patients
with glioblastoma and non-small-cell lung cancer so far have
not been described for gastrointestinal cancers [34-36].
oncogenic activation of egfr signalling can occur by
excessive ligand expression, high expression of egfr, or
transactivation through receptor dimerization [37] with the
ras/raf/mapkk/mapk and  xxxg1743xxx -k/akt signalling
cascades as the main downstream pathways [1]. whereas the
first pathway influences cell proliferation, migration, and
differentiation, the second results in inhibition of apoptosis.
other cellular players involved in egfr signalling include
phospholipase c, ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinases, and
the jak/signal transducer activation of transcription (stat)
pathway (fig. (1)). furthermore, angiogenesis is enhanced
by upregulation of vegf and  xxxg562xxx  [38]. finally,
there is a crosstalk with other signalling molecules such as
g-protein coupled receptors and integrins.
egfr inhibitors
the two main classes of egfr inhibitors are rtk
inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. some rtk inhibitors
are selective for egfr while others inhibit several members
of the egfr family. in phase i trials, the maximumtolerated dose for the selective  xxxd1256xxx  gefitinib
( xxxd2186xxx , iressatm, astrazeneca) was established as 700-800
mg/day, with diarrhea as the dose-limiting toxicity [39, 40]
(fig. ( 2)).
gefitinib has been investigated in two phase ii studies for
advanced esophageal cancer because egfr is almost
universally expressed in adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus.
in the first study, gefitinb was given at a dose of 500 mg/day
to patients with histologically verified advanced esophageal
cancer after failure of one prior chemotherapy regimen4 (table
2). of the 34 patients enrolled, 26 had been fully evaluated.
treatment continued for more than 56 days in 15 of 26
patients (58%). therapy was relatively well tolerated and
there were no deaths due to toxicity.
the most common drug-related adverse events were
diarrhea (58%), skin toxicity (42%), vomiting (12%), and
elevated transaminases (12%). dose reductions were recorded
in 3 patients and interruptions in 4, of whom 2 had both
reduction and interruption. response was assessed in 34
patients, 3 had a partial response (duration: 154, 280, and
121 days), 6 had stable disease, 15 had disease progression,

and 10 were non-eligible, not evaluable, or too early to be
evaluated. in the second study, a total of 27 patients who
had received one previous chemotherapy regimen for
advanced disease, relapsed after surgery and neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, declined chemotherapy or been too ill for
chemotherapy, were recruited using a 2-stage design5 (table
2). biopsies were taken before and 28 days after treatment
with gefitinib at a dose of 500 mg/day. twenty patients had
previous chemotherapy and 7 had no prior chemotherapy.
all 27 patients were evaluable for toxicity; 26 were evaluable
for tumor response. toxicity was mild: rash (grade 2/3)
occurred in 7 patients and diarrhea (> grade 2) in 4 (2 were
grade 3/4). biopsies taken pre- and post-treatment were
evaluated in 7 patients; 5 showed a decrease in ki-67
expression. three patients (12%) had a partial response
(duration: 120, 188 and 313+ days), 12 had stable disease,
and 11 had disease progression. of those patients with a
partial response, 1 had prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 1
had received chemotherapy for advanced disease and 1 had
received gefitinib as primary therapy.
in addition, gefitinib was evaluated in two phase ii trials
for the treatment of colorectal cancer (crc) because egfr is
expressed in up to 70% of cases of crc and may be
associated with more advanced disease and a poor prognosis.
the first study tested gefitinib in combination with

folfox-4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on day 1, 5-fluorouracil
(5-fu) 400 mg/m 2 bolus plus 600 mg/m2 infusion over 22
hours, and  xxxd2462xxx  (lv) 200 mg/m2 given on days 1-2,
every 2 weeks) in patients with advanced crc6 (table 2).
each cycle consisted of 14 days. cycle 1 consisted of
folfox-4 while cycle 2 and subsequent cycles consisted of
folfox-4 with gefitinib at 500 mg per os each day.
patients were stratified by prior therapy for metastatic
disease; group a with no prior therapy and group b with
prior therapy. fifty-six patients had been enrolled (group a:
n=32; group b: n=24). no patient had prior oxaliplatin. all
patients were assessable for toxicity and 49 were assessable
for response. two patients withdrew prior to completing 4
cycles due to unacceptable toxicity. grade 3/4 toxicities
included neutropenia (53%), diarrhea (49%), nausea (28%),
and vomiting (21%). there was one treatment-related death
(e. coli sepsis). in group a, 21 of 27 patients (78%)
achieved a partial response. nine patients in group a went
on to have liver metastases resected; only four of whom were
deemed to have resectable disease at study entry. in group b,
8 of 22 patients (36%) achieved partial response. 18 of 22
group b patients (82%) had received both irinotecan and  xxxd2134xxx .

colorectal cancer7 (table 2). the initial regimen was
gefitinib 250 mg/day continuously from day 1, irinotecan
180 mg/m2 as a 90-minute infusion on day 1,  xxxd2462xxx 
400 mg/m2 over 2h, 5-fu 400 mg/m2 bolus, and 5-fu 600
mg/m 2 as a 22-hour infusion on days 1 and 2. cycles were
repeated every two weeks. dose-limiting neutropenia
required a decrease in doses twice, to result in the following
doses: irinotecan 120 mg/m2, bolus 5-fu 320 mg/m2, and
infusion 600 mg/m2. accrual on this trial was 13 patients,
after 8 patients, the starting dose was reduced because of
neutropenia (3 grade 4) and other dose-limiting toxicity that
included dehydration and metabolic abnormalities (3
patients). at a reduced dose (gefitinib 250 mg/day /
irinotecan 150 mg/m2 / 5-fu bolus-infusion 320-600
mg/m 2), three patients were treated, and two had grade 4,
and one had grade 2 neutropenia. the starting dose was
reduced one step further (gefitinib 250 mg/day / irinotecan
120 mg/m2 / 5-fu bolus-infusion 320-600 mg/m2), and two
patients tolerated this dose without significant toxicity. by
virtue of dose reductions, 8/13 patients were reduced to this
dose level. of patients receiving two or more cycles, there
were 1 partial response (5 months) and 6 stable diseases
(median 4 months). these data implied an interaction
between gefitinib and the chemotherapy regimen used here.
the dose reductions required together with the modest
activity observed led to the early cessation of this trial.
pharmacokinetic analysis to explore a possible interaction
between gefitinib and irinotecan is in progress. finally,
resistance mutations, as recently described for a non-smallcell lung cancer patient, are unknown in gastrointestinal
cancers [41].
the selective  xxxd1256xxx   xxxd2029xxx  ( xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx ,
tarcevatm, genentech) has been evaluated for esophageal,
colorectal, hepatocellular, and biliary carcinoma in phase ii
trials and for locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic
pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine in two
phase iii studies ( xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx -pa3, osi-can-ncic-pa3) with
results pending for the last two studies. chemotherapy for
advanced esophageal cancer has a response rate of 30-50%
and there is no standard second-line regimen, however many
tumors over-express egfr. therefore, 15 patients with
metastatic disease (11 adenocarcinomas, 4 squamous
cancers), who had received up to one prior chemotherapy
regimen, were treated with  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx , given orally at 150 mg
daily, in 4-week cycles8 (table 2). ten patients (67%) were
egfr over-expressors. one confirmed partial response
(egfr+, squamous tumor, female, mediastinal lymph node
disease) was observed after 2 cycles. the majority of patients
(53%) progressed after one cycle. two patients (13%)
progressed during their second cycle and 3 (20%) progressed
during a third cycle. one (egfr+) maintained stable disease
until he progressed after a sixth cycle (7%). no grade 4
toxicities were seen. three patients developed grade 3
hepatic toxicity (2 had elevated alkaline phosphatase, 1 had
elevated bilirubin and ast). two patients had grade 3
dermatologic toxicity (pustular skin rash) which resolved

wiedmann and caca

with antibiotics and dose reduction of  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx  to 100 mg
daily. thus,  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx  appeared to have activity in advanced
esophageal carcinoma, with 1 of 15 pts (egfr+, squamous
histology) demonstrating a partial response.
in another study, 30 patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer have been treated with  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx  at an oral dose of 150
mg daily continuously, on a four weekly cycle 9 (table 2).
primary endpoints were response or disease stabilization,
secondary endpoints were the assessment of molecular
changes with therapy. most patients had received one prior
regimen of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. by intention
to treat analysis, 8 of 25 patients (32%) had stable disease,
12 had progressive disease (48%), and 5 were inevaluable.
five patients with stable disease progressed after 98, 115,
134, 159, 167 days while 3 patients with stable disease were
still on study. the most common adverse events, of any
grade, were rash in 25 patients, diarrhea in 11 patients and
lymphopenia in 13 patients. there were 2 grade 4 adverse
events experienced by patients on  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx , both
constipation. there were 24 grade 3 adverse events
experienced, with the most common events being rash in 4
patients, diarrhea in 3 patients, nausea in 2 patients and
vomiting in 2 patients. egfr staining was evaluated in 15
patients to date. of 5 patients with stable disease, 2 had 4+
staining, 1 had 3+ staining, 1 had 0 staining and 1 was not
evaluable. of 10 patients who had progressive disease, 1 had
4+ staining, 3 had 3+ staining, 3 had 2+ staining and 3
were inevaluable.
since the combination of  xxxd425xxx  and oxaliplatin is
becoming an increasingly attractive option for the treatment
of metastatic crc, a phase ii study was conducted to
evaluate the objective response rate of  xxxd425xxx  plus
oxaliplatin plus  xxxd2029xxx  in previously treated patients with
metastatic crc10 (table 2). the treatment regimen
consisted of 21-day cycles of  xxxd425xxx  at 1,000 mg/m2
twice daily x 14 days (reduced to 750 mg/m2 after first 13
patients experienced excess of grade 3/4 toxicities),
oxaliplatin at 130 mg/m2 on day 1, and  xxxd2029xxx  150 mg
each day. 22 patients have been enrolled, 73% had prior
irinotecan for metastatic disease.
twenty (20) patients were evaluable for response and 22
patients evaluable for toxicity. the objective response rate
was 20% (0 complete response, 4 partial response). sixt-four
percent (64%) of patients had stable disease (8 patients > 4
months). prior to the dose reduction of  xxxd425xxx , 11 of
13 patients had grade 3/4 toxicities (primarily gi toxicities).
since the dose reduction of  xxxd425xxx  (9 patients), there
have only been 4 patients with grade 3/4 toxicities and no
patients off study due to toxicity. the over-experession of
the egfr and its ligand is also frequently seen in
hepatobiliary tumors and may be associated with poor
prognosis. therefore, the primary objective of a phase ii
study was to determine the proportion of patients with either
hepatocellular cancer (hcc) or biliary cancer who were

progression-free at 6 months11 (table 2). a potential benefit
was assumed if the proportion of patients who are
progression-free at 24 weeks was at least 20%. thirty-five
evaluable patients were targated for each diagnostic category.
patients were not selected on the basis of egfr expression
but tumor samples were submitted for egfr analysis from
all patients.  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx  was given continuously at an oral dose
of 150 mg per day. dose adjustments were performed for
toxicity. objective response assessment was undertaken
every 8 weeks and treatment continued until disease
progression and/or undue toxicity.
thirty-five and thirty-nine patients with hcc and biliary
cancer, respectively, were enrolled. median number of cycles
(4 weeks of treatment) was two in both groups. fewer
patients had toxicity-related dose reductions in the biliary
cancer group. greater grade 3/4 skin toxicity and diarrhea
was encountered in the hcc group. seven (35%) of the 20
evaluable patients with hcc were progression free at 6
months. of the 36 evaluable patients with biliary cancer, 7
(25%), were progression-free at 6 months. three and 2
patients had partial radiological response in the hcc and
biliary cancer groups, respectively. median time to response
was 214 days and 58 days for hcc and biliary cancer
groups, respectively. response duration for patients with
hcc was 3, 4+, 7+ months. duration of response for the
biliary cancer group was 3 and 12+ months. all responding
patients had skin rash. thus, these preliminary results
suggest a benefit for egfr blockade with  xxxd2029xxx   xxxd2030xxx  in
patients with hepatobiliary cancers with acceptable toxicity.
several other  xxxg682xxx  inhibitors, such as non-selective
 xxxd421xxx  (pfizer),  xxxd2445xxx  (glaxosmithkline), and
selective pki-166 (novartis) and  xxxd2866xxx  (wyeth) are
currently undergoing phase i and ii testing12,13,14,15,16,17.
cetuximab (imc- xxxd467xxx , erbituxtm, bristol-myers
squibb) is a highly specific chimeric igg-1 monoclonal
antibody that binds to egfr and blocks the ability of egf
to initiate receptor activation and signalling in the tumor.
this blockade results in an inhibition of tumor growth by
interfering with the effects of egfr activation including
tumor invasion and metastases, cell repair, and the
stimulation of vegf production that leads to angiogenesis.

in february 2004, cetuximab was approved by the fda for
the treatment of irinotecan resistant colorectal cancer. this
approval was based on a phase ii and phase iii clinical trials.
in the first study, an open-label phase ii clinical trial, the
antitumor activity and toxicity of single-agent cetuximab in
patients with chemotherapy-refractory crc was evaluated
[42] (table 2). patients were required to have egfr
expression demonstrated onformalin-fixedparaffin-embedded
tumor tissue by immunohistochemical staining before study
participation. patients were also required to have received
irinotecan, either alone or in a combination regimen, and to
have demonstrated clinical failure on this regimen before
study entry. cetuximab was administered weekly by
intravenous infusion. the first dose of 400 mg/m 2 was given
during the course of 2 hours. subsequent weekly treatments
were given at a dose of 250 mg/m2 during the course of 1
hour. fifty-seven eligible patients were treated. all were
assessable for toxicity and response.
the most commonly encountered grade 3 to 4 adverse
events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were an
acne-like skin rash, predominantly on the face and upper
torso (86% with any grade; 18% with grade 3), and a
composite of asthenia, fatigue, malaise, or lethargy (56%
with any grade, 9% with grade 3). two patients (3.5%)
experienced grade 3 allergic reactions requiring
discontinuation of study treatment. a third patient
experienced a grade 3 allergic reaction that resolved, and the
patient continued on the study. neither diarrhea nor
neutropenia were dose limiting in any of the 57 patients
treated.
five patients (9%) achieved a partial response. twentyone additional patients had stable disease or minor
responses. the median survival was 6.4 months. in the
phase iii trial, 329 patients whose crc had progressed
during or within three months after treatment with an
irinotecan-based regimen were randomly assigned to receive
either cetuximab and irinotecan (218 patients) or cetuximab
monotherapy (111 patients) [43] (table 2). in cases of
disease progression, the addition of irinotecan to cetuximab
monotherapy was permitted. the patients were evaluated
radiologically for tumor response and were also evaluated for
the time to tumor progression, survival, and side effects of
treatment. the rate of response in the combination-therapy
group was significantly higher than that in the monotherapy
group (22.9% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.007). the median time to
progression was significantly greater in the combinationtherapy group (4.1 vs. 1.5 months, p < 0.001). the median
survival time was 8.6 months in the combination-therapy
group and 6.9 months in the monotherapy group (p = 0.48).
toxic effects were more frequent in the combination-therapy
group, but their severity and incidence were similar to those
that would be expected with irinotecan alone.
in another phase ii trial, the efficacy and safety of
cetuximab with the folfox-4 regimen as 1st-line
treatment in non-resectable metastatic crc with egfr
expression was investigated18 (table 2). patients received
cetuximab (400 mg/m2 week 1 and 250 mg/m2 weekly
thereafter) plus folfox-4 until progression or unacceptable

toxicity. of the 61 patients screened, 50 (82%) showed
egfr expression on the tumor. forty-three (43) patients
were enrolled. the observed best overall response was based
on 20 evaluable patients: 14 (70%) patients had partial
response, 5 (25%) had stable disease, and 1 was not
evaluable because he withdrew his consent after the 1st
infusion. two patients underwent curative resection of their
hepatic metastasis after confirmed response. moreover, a
randomized phase iii study (explore) was started,
comparing cetuximab plus folfox-4 (arm a, cetuximab
with 400 mg/m2 initial dose followed by 250 mg/m2
weekly) to folfox-4 (arm b) in 2nd-line metastatic,
egfr positive, crc patients19 (table 2). the first stage of
this randomized phase iii trial restricted accrual to 40
patients  xxxd1891xxx  centers to obtain an early assessment of safety
from march to november 2003. they included 20 women
and 20 men with a mean age of 61 years. two patients did
not receive study therapy and were excluded from the
analysis. a total of 178 cycles were administered to the 38
patients with a median of 3 cycles per patient (range 1-15).
there were four disease-related deaths and one severe nonfatal hypersensitivity reaction. the incidence and severity of
these events appeared comparable to previous reports of
cetuximab with chemotherapy or of folfox-4.
the second stage of this randomized phase iii trial is
now in progress to accrue to its target of 1,100 patients. in
addition, cetuximab has has been on a multicenter trial in
combination with gemcitabine in patients with egfr
expressing locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer
who had never received chemotherapy [44] (table 2).
patients were treated with cetuximab at an initial dose of 400
mg/m 2, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly for 7 weeks.
gemcitabine was administered at 1,000 mg/m2 for 7 weeks,
followed by 1 week of rest. in subsequent cycles, cetuximab
was administered weekly, and gemcitabine was administered
weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. sixty-one patients were
screened for egfr expression, 58 patients (95%) had at least
1+ staining, and 41 were enrolled onto the trial. five
patients (12.2%) achieved a partial response, and 26 (63.4%)
had stable disease. the median time to disease progression
was 3.8 months, and the median overall survival duration
was 7.1 months. one-year progression-free survival and
overall survival rates were 12% and 31.7%, respectively.
the most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events
were neutropenia (39.0%), asthenia (22.0%), abdominal pain
(22.0%), and thrombocytopenia (17.1%).
emd72000 (emd pharmaceuticals) is another
monoclonal antibody that blocks ligand binding and inhibits
egfr activation and signal transduction. so far, only a
phase i study evaluating safety and tolerability of
emd72000 plus gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer
has been presented at the asco 2004 meeting20. escalating
doses of emd72000 (400 mg per week (i), 800 mg every
other week (ii), or 800 mg per week (iii), followed by a
weekly dose of 1,000 mg/m 2 gemcitabine) were tested. after

two 4-week cycles, patients with stable or responding
disease continued treatment until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity. pharmacodynamic (pd) effects
(expression of egfr and mapk phosphorylation,
proliferation (ki-67), and  xxxg419xxx ) were studied in skin
biopsies before and after the first treatment cycle. serum was
collected to assess pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (c max,
auc, t1/2) at several timepoints. seventeen patients (i/ii/iii:
n = 5/4/8) were enrolled. egfr expression was confirmed
for 16 tumors. treatment-related toxicities (all grades, in > 3
patients) included skin toxicity (n=9), fever (n=4),
neutropenia (n=3), and leukopenia (n=3). grade 3 toxicities
(all causes, > 1 patient) were neutropenia (n=3), leukopenia
(n=2), fever (n=2), cholangitis (n=2), hypokalemia (n=2),
increased liver enzymes (n=11), and increased ldh (n=2).
non-treatment-related grade 4 toxicities occurred in 3 of 5
patients of group i (cachexia, increased ggt and bilirubin)
and in 1 of 8 patients of group iii (quadriplegia). grade 4
guillain-barre syndrome occurring in the patient with
quadriplegia was reported by the sponsor as possibly
treatment-related. there was 1 death (400 mg) due to nontreatment-related respiratory failure. stable disease occurred
in 3 of 5 patients in group i, 3 of 4 patients in group ii, and
5 of 8 patients in group iii with continuous treatment for up
to 50 weeks. skin biopsies showed emd 72000 inhibited
egfr activation and affected receptor-dependent signalling
and transduction in vivo, effects seen even in the lowest-dose
group. pk data were consistent with results of other studies
of emd 72000 monotherapy. in conclusion, emd 72000 in
biologically effective doses plus standard gemcitabine doses
appeared well tolerated.
targeting the vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) and its receptor
(vegfr)
vegfr signal transduction
a tumor needs to establish new vasculature in order to
obtain the nutrients necessary to sustain growth beyond 1-2
mm [45]. changes occuring in the tumor environment, such
as increased co2, hypoxia, induction of  xxxg1884xxx 
(cox-2),  xxxd2738xxx  production, and genetic events such as
loss of certain oncogenes, may trigger the need for new
vasculature. tumors induce angiogenesis by increasing the
production and secretion of angiogenic factors and proteases
that act in concert to promote angiogenesis. whereas
proteases, secreted by tumor cells and endothelial cells,
degrade the extracellular matrix, allowing endothelial cell
migration, angiogenic factors bind to endothelial cell surface
receptors and promote endothelial cell proliferation and
migration toward the tumor [46]. vascular endothelial
growth factor (vegf) as the most potent stimulator is a
critical regulator of tumor angiogenesis. vegf is a 46-kda
homodimeric glycoprotein produced by tumor and stromal
cells in response to hypoxia and other stimuli [47]. five
vegf isoforms are known, with  xxxg1608xxx  being the most
common. vegf has pleiotropic effects on endothelial cells
and appears to be involved at all stages of angiogenesis. it
binds to the vegf receptor (vegfr), which consists of 4
isoforms itself.  xxxg800xxx  (or  xxxg800xxx ) and  xxxg1274xxx  (or  xxxg1274xxx ,
 xxxg801xxx ) are expressed almost exclusively on endothelial cells,
but also may be expressed on some vegf-expressing tumor

cells, creating at least the possibility of an autostimulatory
(autocrine) activation loop [48]. the principal vegfr in
tumor angiogenesis appears to be  xxxg1274xxx . activation of
 xxxg1274xxx  alone is sufficient to induce angiogenesis and
vascular permeability in response to vegf [49]. ligand
induced activation causes formation of homodimers of the
vegfr. then,  xxxg2198xxx -mediated autophosphorylation of the receptor triggers the intracellular signalling
pathways, generating specific responses in the endothelial
cell. signalling through  xxxg1274xxx  stimulates capillary
dilation and permeabilization, endothelial cell proliferation,
migration, protease release, and survival through activation
of multiple signalling cascades [50-52].

the treatment of metastatic crc that had demonstrated the
superiority of bevacizumab (bv) in combination with 5fluorouracil (5-fu) /  xxxd2462xxx  (lv) over 5-fu / lv alone
in terms of response rate, median time to disease
progression, and median survival [53] (table 3).
interestingly, a low dose regimen of bv (5 mg/kg every 2
weeks) was more efficient than a high dose regimen (10
mg/kg every 2 weeks). based on this study, a large
randomized phase iii trial was conducted, including 813
patients with previously untreated metastatic crc,
randomly assigned to receive irinotecan (125 mg/m2), 5-fu
(500 mg/m2) and lv (20 mg/m2 (ifl; once weekly for 4
weeks; cycle repeated every 6 weeks) plus bv (5 mg/kg of
body weight every two weeks) (n = 402) or ifl plus placebo
(n = 411) [54] (table 3). the primary end point of this
study was overall survial. secondary end points were
progression-free survival, the response rate, duration of
response, safety and the quality of life.

vegf and vegfr inhibitors
cancer treatment directed toward tumor vasculature offers
oncologists an additional series of targets for cancer therapy.

15.6 months in the group given ifl plus placebo (p <
0.001). the median duration of progression-free survival was
10.6 months in the group given ifl plus bv, as compared
with 6.2 months in the group given ifl plus placebo (p <
0.001); the corresponding rates of response were 44.8% and
34.8% (p = 0.004). the median duration of the response was
10.4 months in the group given ifl plus bv, as compared
with 7.1 months in the group given ifl plus placebo (p =
0.001). grade 3 hypertension was more common during
treatment with ifl plus bv than with ifl plus placebo
(11.0% vs. 2.3%) but was easily managed. the authors
concluded that the addition of bv to fluorouracil-based
combination chemotherapy results in statistically significant
and clinically meaningful improvement in survival among
patients with metastatic crc. both studies led to the fda
approval of bv for metastatic crc in february 2004.
the eastern cooperative oncology group is now
carrying out a phase iii, three arm, clinical trial of bv in the
second line setting. in arm 1, patients receive folfox-4
alone, in arm 2, they receive folfox-4 with bv, and in
arm 3 they received bv alone (this arm was discontinued as
bv alone was not showing efficacy). moreover, a nci trial
(trc-0301) is currently investigating the safety and efficacy
of the bv/5-fu/lv regimen for crc patients in the third
line setting.
in the meantime, the fda and genentech sent a letter to
healthcare professionals that warns of the risk for serious and
fatal arterial thromboembolic events related to the use of bv
in patients with metastatic crc. the warning was based on
a meta-analysis from combination studies of bv and 5-fu
resulting in a twofold higher risk of serious arterial
thromboembolic events, with an estimated overall risk of 5%
(fda and genentech, august 12, 2004). the fda
recommends that bv be permanently discontinued in
patients who experience a thromboembolic event, including
cerebrovascular accident (stroke), myocardial infarction,
transient ischemic attack, and angina. finally, the
antivascular effects of bv have been proven in a small phase
i study of patients with rectal cancer [55] (table 3). six
patients with primary and locally advanced adenocarcinoma
were enrolled in a preoperative treatment protocol of bv
administration alone (5 mg/kg intravenously), followed after
2 weeks -the approximate half-life of bv in circulation- by
concurrent administration of bv with 5-fu and external
beam radiation therapy of the pelvis and surgery, 7 weeks
after treatment completion. macroscopic and histologic
analysis of the surgical specimen revealed a marked response
in all 6 patients, with only microscopic disease in 5 of the
patients.
bv is also currently being investigated for the treatment
of advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with
gemcitabine.  xxxg1285xxx  mutations, which are present in 90% of
patients with pancreatic cancer, can result in over-expression
of vegf, making bv an agent to explore. preliminary
results of a phase ii study were presented at the asco 2004
meeting21 (table 3). gemcitabine was given intravenously
at a dose of 1,000 mg/m2 at days 1, 8, and 15 every 28
days, bv at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. at days 1 and 15 of each

cycle. forty-two evaluted patients showed a partial response
in 21%, lasting a median of 9.4 months, and in 45% stable
disease, lasting a median of 5.4 months. median time to
progression was 5.8 months and median survival 9.0
months. six-month survival was 74%. encouraged by these
results, a phase iii trial is now in progress.
in a similar approach, gemcitabine was combined with
 xxxd3342xxx  (thalomidtm,  xxxd3342xxx ), which has shown
promising results in malignant and non-malignant
conditions because of its immunomodulatory and antiangiogenesis properties22 (table 3). twenty-seven patients
(24 metastatic/3 locally advanced) were treated with an
average daily  xxxd3342xxx  dose of 320 mg (range 50-700
mg). of 21 evaluable patients, 3 had a partial response, 13
stable disease, and 5 progressive disease. thirty-five percent
of the patients had a clinical benefit response, measured by a
pain scale, karnofsky performance scale, and weight gain.
median survival was 183 days, 9 of 27 evaluable patients
survived more than 6 months, and 4 more than 1 year.
median time to progression was 112 days. a > 50%
reduction in tumor marker ca 19-9 occurred in 55% of the
patients. the efficacy of oral  xxxd3342xxx  was also tested in
the treatment of advanced hcc [56] (table 3). sixty-eight
patients with unresectable and non-embolizable hcc were
consecutively enrolled in a compassionate treatment program
of oral  xxxd3342xxx .  xxxd3342xxx  was given at a starting
dose of 200 mg per day. the dose was gradually escalated in
100 mg steps up to 600 mg per day if no limiting toxicities
developed. sixty-three patients were evaluable for response.
one complete and 3 partial responses were seen, with a
response rate of 6.3%. the duration of response was 50+,
24.6, 11.6+ and 8.7+ weeks, respectively. all four
responders had a dramatic decrease in tumor marker alphafetoprotein (afp) levels. another 6 of the 42 patients with
elevated afp levels before treatment had a more than 50%
decrease in their afp levels after  xxxd3342xxx  treatment.
totally, 10 patients had an objective response to
 xxxd3342xxx . the median overall survival for all of the 68
patients was 18.7 weeks with a 1-year survival rate of
27.6%. the median overall survival of the 10 patients with
an objective response to  xxxd3342xxx  was 62.4 weeks. all
responders responded at a dose equal to or less than 300 mg
per day. toxicities of  xxxd3342xxx  were generally
manageable, and only 16, 6, and 0 patients developed grade
2, 3, and 4 toxicities, respectively.
 xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxd3496xxx , novartis) is an orally
active inhibitor of vegf receptor. phase i trials showed that
it does reduce tumor blood supply and has activity in
serveral types of solid tumors. doses up to 2,000 mg/day
were well tolerated. the most frequently reported adverse
events were nausea (47%), fatigue (39%), vomiting (36%),
and dizziness (34%). as a single agent, it produced disease
satabilization in 46% of patients (new medicine`s oncology
knowledge base 2003).  xxxd3496xxx  is now in studies
exploring its activity when combined with folfox in
previously untreated metastatic crc. in one extended phase

treatment continued until disease progression or severe

establishing the safety and preliminary response profile of the
regimen. as a result, the safety profile appeared to closely
match that of folfox-4 alone.  xxxd3496xxx  was well tolerated
at doses < 1,250 mg/day. four percent of the 28 patients
who could be evalutated achieved a complete response, 50%
a partial response, and additional 32% reached disease

other molecular targets
farnesyltransferase inhibitors
farnesyltransferase inhibitor  xxxd3381xxx .  xxxd3381xxx 
( xxxd3381xxx , zarnestratm, johnson & johnson) is a selective
nonpeptidomimetic inhibitor of farnesyltransferase (ftase),
an enzyme responsible for the covalent addition of a 15carbon farnesyl lipid to the carboxy-terminal cysteine of
many cell-signalling proteins, including  xxxg1077xxx  [57] (fig.
(2)). given that  xxxg1285xxx  mutations are nearly universal in
human pancreatic cancer [58], this tumor was initially
selected for development of  xxxd3381xxx . however, an
increasing body of evidence indicates that the antineoplastic
effects of  xxxd3381xxx  and other ftase inhibitors (ftis) may
involve ras-independent mechanisms [57, 59]. since
 xxxd3381xxx  demonstrated preclinical activity against pancreatic
cell lines and xenografts, a phase ii study was undertaken to
determine its clinical activity and effect on target proteins in
patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [60]
(table 4).
twenty patients who had not received prior therapy were
treated with 300 mg of  xxxd3381xxx  orally every 12 hours for 21
of 28 days. however, no objective responses were seen.
median time to progression was 4.9 weeks, and median
survival time was 19.7 weeks. the estimated 6-month
survival rate was 25%, with no patients progression-free at 6
months. grade 3/4 toxicities were liver enzyme elevation,
anemia,
neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia,
fatigue,
nausea/vomiting, rash, and anorexia. ftase activity (mean
+/- sd) decreased by 49.8% +/- 9.8% 4 hours after treatment

molecularly targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer

on day 1 and 36.1% +/- 24.8% before treatment on day 15.
to determine whether addition of  xxxd3381xxx  to standard
gemcitabine therapy improves overall survival in previously
untreated advanced pancreatic cancer, a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase iii study, comparing
gemcitabine plus  xxxd3381xxx  vs. gemcitabine plus placebo was
initiated [61] (table 4).  xxxd3381xxx  was given at 200 mg
twice daily orally continuously; gemcitabine was given at
1,000 mg/m2 intravenously weekly x 7 for 8 weeks, then
weekly x 3 every 4 weeks. the primary end point was
overall survival; secondary end points included 6-month and
1-year survival rates, progression-free survival, response rate,
safety, and quality of life. six hundred and eighty-eight
patients were enrolled. baseline characteristics were well
balanced between the two treatment arms. however, no
statistically significant differences in survival parameters were
observed. the median overall survival for the experimental
arm was 193 vs. 182 days for the control arm (p = 0.75); 6month and 1-year survival rates were 53% and 27% vs. 49%
and 24% for the control arm, respectively; median
progression-free survival was 112 vs. 109 days for the control
arm. ten drug-related deaths were reported for the
experimental arm and 7 for the control arm. neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia grade > 3 were observed in 40% and 15%
in the experimental arm versus 30% and 12% in the control
arm. incidences of non-hematologic adverse events were
similar in two groups.
to determine whether  xxxd3381xxx  improves survival in
patients with refractory advanced crc, which exhibits  xxxg1285xxx 
point mutations in 40 to 50%, a multicenter, double-blind,
prospective randomized study was conducted [62, 63] (table
4). three hundred sixty-eight patients were randomly
assigned to  xxxd3381xxx  (300 mg twice daily) orally for 21 days
every 28 days or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. all patients received
best supportive care. the primary end point was overall
survival, secondary end points were progression free
survival, tumor response, toxicity, and quality of life. the
two treatment groups were well balanced for baseline
demographics, including previous chemotherapy for
advanced crc. the median overall survival for  xxxd3381xxx 
was 174 days and 185 days for those patients receiving
placebo (p = 0.376). one patient achieved a partial response
in the  xxxd3381xxx  arm. stable disease (> 3 months) was
observed in 24.3% patients in the  xxxd3381xxx  group compared
to 12.8% in the placebo arm. this did not translate into a
statistically significant increase in progression-free survival.
overall, treatment was well tolerated. there was no
statistically significant difference in quality of life between
arms. it was concluded, that single agent  xxxd3381xxx , given at
this dose and schedule, has an acceptable toxicity profile, but
does not improve overall survival compared to best
supportive care alone in refractory advanced crc.
matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors
matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are a family of zincdependent proteinases that are associated with the
tumorigenic process. mmps degrade the extracellular matrix,
promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. they also
regulate host defense mechanisms and normal cell function.
blocking mmps with mmp inhibitors is a new approach in
cancer treatment [64]. a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase iii study was designed to evaluate the

current cancer drug targets, 2005, vol. 5, no. 3

185

ability of the orally administered mmp inhibitor marimastat
( xxxd2544xxx , british biotech) to prolong survival in patients
with non-resectable gastric and gastro-oesophageal
adenocarcinoma [65] (table 4). three hundred and sixtynine patients with histological proof of adenocarcinoma, who
had received no more than a single regimen of 5-fluorouracilbased chemotherapy, were randomized to receive either
marimastat (10 mg twice daily) or placebo. patients were
treated for as long as was tolerable. the primary endpoint
was overall survival with secondary endpoints of time to
disease progression and quality of life. at the point of
protocol-defined study completion (85% mortality in the
placebo arm) there was a modest difference in survival in the
intention-to-treat population in favor of marimastat (p =
0.07). this survival benefit was maintained over a further 2
years of follow-up. the median survival was 138 days for
placebo and 160 days for marimastat, with 2-year survival of
3% and 9% respectively. a significant survival benefit was
identified at study completion in the pre-defined sub-group of
123 patients who had received prior chemotherapy (p =
0.045). this benefit increased with 2 years additional followup (p = 0.006), with 2-year survival of 5% and 18%
respectively. progression-free survival was also significantly
longer for patients receiving marimastat compared to placebo
(p = 0.009). marimastat treatment was associated with the
development of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation.
events of anemia, abdominal pain, jaundice and weight loss
were more common in the placebo arm.
another randomized phase iii study investigated
marimastat in unresectable pancreatic cancer [66] (table 4).
two hundred and thirty-nine patients were randomized to
receive gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) in combination with
either marimastat or placebo. the primary end-point was
survival. objective tumor response, duration of response,
time to treatment failure and disease progression, quality of
life, and safety were also assessed. there was no significant
difference in survival between gemcitabine plus marimastat
and gemcitabine plus placebo. median survival times were
165.5 and 164 days and 1-year survival was 18% and 17%
respectively. there were no significant differences in overall
response rates (11 and 16% respectively), progression-free
survival or time to treatment failure between the treatment
arms. the gemcitabine and marimastat combination was
well tolerated with only 2.5% of patients withdrawn due to
presumed marimastat toxicity. grade 3 or 4 musculoskeletal
toxicities were reported in only 4% of the marimastat treated
patients, although 59% of marimastat treated patients
reported some musculoskeletal events.
in addition, the selective mmp inhibitor bay 12-9566 (4[4-(chlorophenyl)phenyl]-4-oxo-2s-(phenylthiomethyl) butanoic acid; bayer) (fig. (2)) was studied for the same
indication [67] (table 4). patients with advanced pancreatic
adenocarcinoma who had not previously received
chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive bay 129566 800 mg orally continuously twice daily or gemcitabine
1,000 mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1, 8, 15,
22, 29, 36, and 43 for the first 8 weeks, and then days 1, 8,
and 15 of each subsequent 28-day cycle. the primary end
point was overall survival; secondary end points were
progression-free survival, tumor response, quality of life, and
clinical benefit. the study was closed to accrual after the
second interim analysis on the basis of the recommendation

186

current cancer drug targets, 2005, vol. 5, no. 3

of the national cancer institute of canada clinical trials
group data safety monitoring committee. there were 277
patients enrolled onto the study, 138 in the bay 12-9566
arm and 139 in the gemcitabine arm. the rates of serious
toxicity were low in both arms. the median survival for the
bay 12-9566 arm and the gemcitabine arm was 3.74
months and 6.59 months, respectively (p < 0.001). the
median progression-free survival for the bay 12-9566 and
gemcitabine arms was 1.68 and 3.5 months, respectively (p
< 0.001). quality-of-life analysis also favored gemcitabine.
therefore, gemcitabine was significantly superior to bay
12-9566 in advanced pancreatic cancer.
proteasome inhibitors
the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib ( xxxd357xxx ,  xxxd357xxx , valcadetm, millenium pharmaceuticals) contains a
boronate moeity linked to a dipeptide (fig. (2)) and
reversibly inhibits a relatively new and unexpected target,
the 26s proteasome. this large, multi-subunit protein
complex, which is present in high amounts in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of all eukaryotic cells, has the task of
eliminating cellular proteins, including proteins that have
been tagged for degradation through a complex modification
termed “polyubiquitination” [68]. proteins entering the
proteasome are stripped of their ubiquitin, unfolded, and
subsequently degraded through catalytic activities within the
core of the proteasome.
substrates for ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation
include a variety of proteins with such critical function as
regulation of the cell cycle, transcription, and apoptosis, as
well as the regulation of chemotaxis, angiogenesis, and cell
adhesion. bortezomib induces apoptosis in a wide variety of
cancer cell lines and other transformed cells, yet it has
relatively few toxic effects on normal cells. in additon, it has
considerable efficacy as a single agent against human tumor
xenografts and primary cultures of tumor cells from patients
with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, head an neck cancer, and prostate cancer [69].
even more exciting, bortezomib markedly enhances the
apoptotic effects of irinotecan, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, and
ionizing irradiation, as demonstrated in colon tumor models.
therefore, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase ii
study is currently being conducted to determine objective
tumor response to bortezomib ± irinotecan in patients with
refractory crc24 (table 4). secondary objectives are safety
and tolerability, survival, and quality of life. patients with
relapsed or refractory, inoperable, locally advanced or
metastatic crc are randomized to bortezomib alone (1.5
mg/m 2 i.v. on day 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21 days) or
bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 21
days) + irinotecan (125 mg/m 2 i.v. on day 1 and 8). adverse
events for the first 68 patients were generally similar in both
arms. grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 24 of 68 (35%)
patients, mainly gastrointestinal (22%), fatigue (10%),
neuropathy (7%), and hematologic (neutropenia: 9%;
thrombocytopenia: 6%). 51% had drug-related advese events
(all grades), including nausea (34%), fatigue (32%), diarrhea

(32%), vomiting (22%), and constipation (16%). accrual,
interim analyses, and efficacy assessments are ongoing.
bortezomib was also given as an i.v. bolus on days 1, 4,
8 and 11 of a 3 week cycle to patients with unresectable
hcc in a phase i/ii trial to assess the dose limiting toxicity
(dlt) and maximum tolerated dose (mtd). secondary
objectives included response assessment, safety and
pharmacodynamics of bortezomib25 (table 4). so far 18
patients have been accrued to the study. the dlt was
defined on toxicities that occurred in cycle 1. a mean of 4.5
cycles (range 1-12) has been administered to these patients,
28 cycles at dose level 1 (1 mg/m2, 6 patients) and 54 cycles
at dose level 2 (1.3 mg/m2, 12 patients). no grade iii/iv
dlts in cycle 1 occurred. grade ii/iii toxicities per patient
included thrombocytopenia (7/3, respectively), fatigue (5/3),
neuropathy (2/1), loss of appetite (6/2), hypotension (0/2),
and abdominal cramps (2/1). one grade iv
thrombocytopenia was observed. five patients required dose
reduction. based on observed toxicities in all cycles 1.3
mg/m 2 was considered the mtd. stable disease has been
observed in 7/15 evaluable patients lasting for 21, 14, 36+,
22+, 16+, 12+ and 9+ weeks, 8 patients progressed.
pharmacodynamics of bortezomib were similar to findings in
patients without compromised liver function.
targeting the mammalian target
(mtor)

of

rapamycin

the rapamycin analogues  xxxd3307xxx  (wyett),  xxxd3114xxx 
(ariad), and  xxxd2072xxx  (novartis) bind to a highly
conserved cytoplasmic receptor fk506-binding protein-12
(fkbb12). sirolimus (fig. (2)), the major metabolite of
 xxxd3307xxx , also binds to  xxxg798xxx . the  xxxg798xxx - xxxd3307xxx 
( xxxg798xxx - xxxd3114xxx ,
 xxxg798xxx - xxxd2072xxx ,
fkbp12sirolimus) complex then binds to and inhibits the kinase
activities of the tor protein subfamily, an activity not
expressed by either component alone. loss of mtor
function leads to arrest in early g1 phase of the cell cycle
and a severe reduction in protein synthesis triggered by
genes that are important for cell growth [70]. the first
targeted protein is p70s6 kinase, a serine-threonine kinase
that is activated in response to a broad range of mitogenic
stimuli.
the second end point for the mtor-dependent
phosphorylation pathway is the translational-repressor
protein phas-1 (also termed 4e-bp) (fig. (1)). both
proteins participate in the regulation of protein synthesis in
cells stimulated by either mitogens or hormones. the
addition of a  xxxg1478xxx  (mtor)
inhibitor to imatinib as a new treatment for metastatic
gists is currently under investigation [71]. in addition, the
inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis by sirolimus
(rapamunetm, wyett) (fig. (2)) has been studied in the
setting of liver transplantation for hcc where mtor
inhibitors are used as immunosuppressors because of their
il-2 blocking activity. a consecutive series of 40 patients
with hcc within the standard milan criteria (single tumors
< 5 cm, or up to 3 tumors < 3 cm (n = 19)) and beyond
(extended criteria; single tumors < 7.5 cm, multiple tumors

molecularly targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer

< 5 cm (n = 21)) underwent liver transplantation with a
sirolimus-based immunosuppressive protocol designed to
minimize exposure to calcineurin inhibitors and steroids [72]
(table 4). at 44.3 ± 19.3 months follow-up, 1- and 4-year
survivals were 94.1 ± 5.7% and 87.4 ± 9.3%, in the milan
group, respectively, and 90.5 ± 6.4% and 82.9 ± 9.3% in the
extended criteria group, respectively. five patients died
during follow-up, only 1 from recurrent hcc. five tumor
recurrences have occurred at median 17 months
posttransplant, 1 in the milan group and 4 in the extended
criteria group. median survival in the patients with recurrent
tumor was 42 months and the median postrecurrence
survival was 15.5 months. the rate of patients who were
alive and free of tumor at 1 and 4 years was 94.1 ± 5.7% and
81.1 ± 9.9%, respectively, in the milan group and was 90.5
± 6.4% and 76.8 ± 10.5%, respectively, in the extended
criteria group. five patients had sirolimus discontinued for
toxicity, while 24 of 35 surviving patients had sirolimus
monotherapy immunosuppression. the study concludes,
that the milan criteria for liver transplantation in the presence
of hcc can be carefully extended without compromising
outcomes because of the beneficial effects of sirolimus on
tumor recurrence and survival with an acceptable rate of
rejection and toxicity.
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors
people who have regularly taken aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nasaids) are at a
reduced risk of developing or dying from crc [73-75].
nsaids could reduce the risk of cancer through the
inhibition of cox-2, the enzyme that is responsible for the
production of various prostaglandins. prostaglandines play a
key role on the accelerated proliferation of tumor tissue.
furthermore there is mounting evidence that nsaids may
have the abilitiy to restore apoptosis and inhibit
angiogenesis [76, 77].
celecoxib (celebrextm, pfizer), a selective cox-2
inhibitor, was evaluated in a phase ii study, exploring the
addition of celecoxib (400 mg twice daily per os) during
folfox-7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 day 1, and  xxxd2147xxx 
400 mg/m 2 day 1, and 5-fu 46 h 2,400 mg/m2 every two
weeks for 6 cycles) chemotherapy and chemotherapy-free
interval (cfi) in patients with previously untreated non
-resectable metastatic colorectaladenocarcinoma26 (table 4).
chemotherapy was then interrupted and reintroduced at
progression. fourty-four patients were included and half of
the patients had one metastatic site. fourty-two patients
were evaluable for safety and 41 for response analysis. grade
3-4 toxicity per patients (%) during the 6 first cycles of
folfox-7 plus celecoxib were neutropenia in 5%,
thrombocytopenia in 17%, diarrhea in 5%, nausea/vomiting
in 5%, and neuropathy in 2%. during follow-up period
(median 37 weeks), 2 patients presented grade 1-2
epigastralgia without ulcers and 1 digestive hemorrhage with
gastritis. one complete response, 15 partial responses
(response rate 39%), 18 stable diseases (44%) and 7
progressive diseases (17%) were observed (intention to treat).

median progression free survival was 28 weeks, 28 of 42
patients had a cfi. median cfi duration was 72 days with
43% with progressive disease after 2 months of cfi. in
conclusion, celecoxib combined with folfox-7 was
associated with a good safety, but a response rate of only
39%.
celecoxib was also tested in another phase ii study in
combination with a  xxxd425xxx  and irinotecan regimen27
(table 4). the primary objective was to estimate the
objective response rate of patients with metastatic crc.
previously untreated patients, except for adjuvant therapy,
with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma were eligible for
this study. patients received irinotecan 70 mg/m2 on days 1
and 8, and  xxxd425xxx  2,000 mg/m2/day from day 1 to 14
of a 21-day cycle. celecoxib was administered at a dose 400
mg twice-daily starting day –7 until termination from study.
a total of 23 patients were enrolled on the study. in an
intention to treat analysis, objective response and stable
disease were seen in 41% and 27%, respectively. objective
response rate in the 17 patients evaluable for response was
53%. no treatment related deaths were observed. the only
grade 3/4 toxicity was diarrhea (22%). two patients
developed grade 2 hand-foot syndrome and one patient
developed grade 3 neutropenia. only 1 patient was
hospitalized for grade 4 diarrhea. in conclusion, celecoxib
could be safely administered in combination with irinotecan
and  xxxd425xxx . the inclusion of celecoxib appeared to
significantly reduce the toxicity profile of this regimen,
especially with respect to the hand and foot syndrome,
myelosuppression and mucositis. these results suggest that
this triple regimen had an optimum therapeutic index in
metastatic crc.
since cox-2 is also over-expressed in 45-72% of
pancreatic cancers and inhibition of cox-2 sensitizes human
pancreatic cancer cells to the apoptotic effects of cytotoxic
agents, a phase ii study was undertaken to determine the
effects of adding celecoxib to a regimen of gemcitabine for the
treatment of advanced pancreatic carcinoma28 (table 4).
from january 2001 to july 2002, 32 consecutive patients
entered the trial, 22 patients were metastatic, and 10 patients
had locally advanced disease. the schedule consisted of
1,000 mg/m2 gemcitabine on days 1, 8 every 3 weeks and
celecoxib (400 mg twice daily). although the dose of
celecoxib was high, neither gastric toxicity nor renal failure
were observed. only 3 patients (9%) had a minimum
creatinine increase. clinical benefit was obtained in 46% of
patients, 38% had no basal pain and 16% did not achieve
any symptom control. median survival was 9.1 months and
1-year survival rate was 36%.
another phase ii study tried to determine the effects of
adding celecoxib to a regimen of gemcitabine by fixed dose
rate infusion and cisplatin29 (table 4). the primary endpoint
was survival at 6 months in patients with metastatic

pancreatic cancer treated with the gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2
by fixed dose rate (10 mg/m2/min)), cisplatin (35 mg/m2 on
days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle), and celecoxib (400 mg twice
daily continuously starting day –7 until termination from
study) regimen. a total of 22 patients were enrolled in the
study. seventeen patients were response evaluable. in an
intention to treat analysis, objective response and stable
disease were seen in 9% and 27%, respectively. nine
patients were alive at 6-months. median overall survival
time was 5.7 months. no treatment related deaths were
observed. the most commonly reported grade 3/4 toxicities
were neutropenia (65%), thrombocytopenia (55%), and
anemia (35%). the majority of the patients required dose
reductions of gemcitabine and cisplatin. in conclusion,
celecoxib could be safely administered in combination with
gemcitabine and cisplatin. the regimen of gemcitabine by
the fixed dose rate infusion and cisplatin was associated with
a significant myelosuppression. the addition of celecoxib to
a regimen utilizing gemcitabine by fixed dose rate infusion
did not appear to have a significant impact on the 6-month
survival rate and overall survival.
pdgf-r inhibitors
pdgf-r inhibitor  xxxd3264xxx 
pdgf and its receptor are expressed in many tumors. it
has been shown that inhibition of pdgf-r reduces
interstitial hypertension and increases transcapillary transport
in tumors in vitro and in vivo, thus enhancing the antitumor
effect of chemotherapy [78, 79]. moreover, direct antitumor
activity has been observed with the pdgf-r inhibitor
 xxxd3264xxx  (sugen) (which also inhibits vegfr, c-kit-r,
and  xxxg801xxx -r) in patients with gist tumors with aquired
resistance to imatinib [80] (see above).
protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitors
protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitors  xxxd377xxx  and ucn01
protein kinase c (pkc) is a family of lipid-dependent
membrane-associated enzymes with important roles in cell
signalling pathways (fig. (1)).  xxxd377xxx  1 (gpc biotech),
a compound derived from the marine invertebrate bugula
neritina, has a modulatory effect on pkc-mediated cell
biology. in a phase ii study of patients with advanced crc,
 xxxd377xxx  1 showed no responses as a single agent [81].
however,  xxxd377xxx  1 continued to be developed as a
response modifier to traditional cytotoxic agents, with phase
ii studies in several tumor types, including gastric cancer in
combination with cisplatin (nci-t99-0040, results
pending), metastatic esophageal or stomach cancer in
combination with paclitaxel (nci-250, results pending), and
pancreatic cancer in combination with paclitaxel30. in the last
study,  xxxd377xxx  at 25 µg/m2, in combination with
paclitaxel, caused moderate myalgias, and 28% of the
patients experienced prolonged stable disease. however,
there was not sufficient activity to support further study of
the substance in patients with pancreatic cancer. thrombotic
events appeared to be rather frequent.

 xxxd4xxx   xxxd697xxx  ( xxxd697xxx , kyowa hakko kogyo
company) is another pkc inhibitor that, in isolated enzyme
assays, can also inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks),
which are important regulators of cell cycle progression.
 xxxd4xxx   xxxd697xxx  blocks cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis
[82]. there are several ongoing trials in various solid
tumors, testing  xxxd4xxx   xxxd697xxx  in combination with cisplatin,
carboplatin, and irinotecan. two trials in pancreatic cancer,
one in combination with 5-fu (nci-5509) and one in
combination with gemcitabine (nci-5510) have been
completed with results pending.
mek-1/2 inhibitors
 xxxd1688xxx  and  xxxd2856xxx 
an oral, highly selective inhibitor of the dual specificity
mapk/extracellular-signal-related kinase (erk) kinases
mek-1 and mek-2,  xxxd1688xxx  ( xxxd1688xxx , pfizer), prevents
the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of mapk, an
important mediator of several signal transduction pathways
(fig. (1)). in a multicenter open-label phase ii study for
patients with breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small-cell lung
cancer (nsclc), and pancreatic cancer  xxxd1688xxx  was
administered continuously at 800 mg twice daily [83].
sixty-seven patients with breast (n = 14), colon (n = 20),
nsclc (n = 18), and pancreatic (n = 15) cancer received a
total of 194 courses of treatment. no complete or partial
responses were observed. stable disease lasting a median of
4.4 months (range, 4 to 18 months) was confirmed in 8
patients (1 breast, 2 colon, 2 pancreas, and 3 nsclc
patients). treatment was well tolerated, with 81% of patients
experiencing toxicities of grade 2 or less severity. most
common toxicities included diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, and
rash. a mild association (p < 0.055) between baseline
phospho-erk expression in archived tumor specimens and
stable disease was observed. thus,  xxxd1688xxx  was generally
well tolerated but demonstrated insufficient antitumor
activity to warrant further development in the four tumors
tested.  xxxd2856xxx  (pfizer), a second generation mek
inhibitor, has recently entered clinical development and,
with
significantly
improved
pharmacologic
and
pharmaceutical properties compared with  xxxd1688xxx , it may
better test the therapeutic potential of mek inhibition in
cancer.
src inhibitors
 xxxd1815xxx 
since the non-receptor tyrosine-kinase src is crucial for
a multitude of signalling transduction pathways regulating
cellular growth and migration, it may be another attractive
candidate for tumor therapy in humans. a recent study has
tested the in vitro and in vivo effects of src inhibitor  xxxd1815xxx  (bristol-myers squibb) [84].
histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors (hdis)
saha,  xxxd1797xxx , ci-994,  xxxd2001xxx , and  xxxd1841xxx 
the histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors (hdis) are a
new class of antineoplastic agents currently being evaluated
in clinical trials. while these agents have been studied
extensively in the laboratory, only recently has their

molecularly targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer

mechanism of action begun to be elucidated. several
structural classes of compounds have been shown to exert
hdac inhibition,
including
sodium
 xxxd3211xxx ,
 xxxd3529xxx  (saha, merck), nvplaq824 (novartis), ci-994 (n-acetyldinaline, pd123654,
parke-davis),  xxxd2001xxx  (calbiochem), and  xxxd1841xxx 
( xxxd3144xxx , fujisawa). the hdis have been shown to
induce differentiation, to decrease cell proliferation, and to
induce cell death. hdis are thought to exert their antineoplastic effects by altering the expression of genes that play
a role in the control of cell growth, and transformation. the
hdis have specific and well-defined effects on cancer cells.
preliminary results from clinical trials suggest that these
agents are very promising [85, 86].
hypoxia-inducible factor (hif) inhibitiors
chetomin
homeostasis under hypoxic conditions is maintained
through a coordinated transcriptional response mediated by
the hypoxia-inducible factor (hif) pathway and requires
coactivation by the cbp and p300 transcriptional
coactivators. through a target-based high-throughput screen,
chetomin (alexis biochemicals), an antibiotic metabolite
of chaetomium spp., was recently identified as a disrupter of
hif binding to p300. at a molecular level, chetomin
disrupts the structure of the ch1 domain of p300 and
precludes its interaction with hif, thereby attenuating
hypoxia-inducible transcription. systemic administration of
chetomin inhibited hypoxia-inducible transcription within
tumors and inhibited tumor growth. these results
demonstrated a therapeutic window for pharmacological
attenuation of hif activity and further establish the
feasibility of disrupting a signal transduction pathway by
targeting the function of a transcriptional coactivator with a
small molecule [87].
aurora kinase inhibitors
zm447439, hesperadin and vx-608
the aurora2  xxxg1377xxx  localizes to
spindle poles (centromeres) during cell division and is
involved in the regulation of proper segregation of
chromosomes during mitosis. over-expression of
aurora2 causes centrosome missegregation, aneuploidy
and transformation of cells [88]. elevated expression of this
protein has been observed in an impressively high percentage
of colon cancers [89]. based on these data, aurora2
appears to be a crucial regulator of cell division and therefore
a prime candidate for therapeutic interference in cancer.
zm447439 (astrazeneca) (fig. (2)), hesperadin (roche),
and vx-608 (vertex) are promising aurora2 kinase
inhibitors [90].
hedgehog inhibitors
cyclopamine
hedgehog signalling, an essential pathway during
embryonic pancreatic development, the misregulation of
which has been implicated in several forms of cancer, may
also be an important mediator in human pancreatic
carcinoma. it was reported that  xxxg2067xxx  (shh), a

current cancer drug targets, 2005, vol. 5, no. 3

189

secreted hedgehog ligand, is abnormally expressed in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions:
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (panin). pancreata of
pdx-shh mice (in which shh is misexpressed in the
pancreatic endoderm) develop abnormal tubular structures, a
phenocopy of human panin-1 and -2. moreover, these
panin-like lesions also contain mutations in  xxxg1285xxx  and
overexpress  xxxg721xxx , which are genetic mutations found
early in the progression of human pancreatic cancer.
furthermore, hedgehog signalling remains active in cell
lines established from primary and metastatic pancreatic
adenocarcinomas. notably, inhibition of hedgehog signalling
by cyclopamine (lc laboratories) induced apoptosis and
blocked proliferation in a subset of the pancreatic cancer cell
lines both in vitro and in vivo. these data suggest that this
pathway may have an early and critical role in the genesis of
this cancer, and that maintenance of hedgehog signalling is
important for aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis, thus
rendering hedgehog inhibition an interesting anti-cancer
target [91].
transforming growth factorfinally, the role of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta)
in cancer biology is complex and involves aspects of tumor
suppression as well as tumor promotion. the inhibition of
proliferation of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoetic cell
lineages is central to tumor suppression. however, more
advanced tumors often become refractory to tgf-beta mediated
growth inhibition and over-express tgf-beta, which might
change tumor biology and lead then to tumor growth and
metastasis. the main downstream signalling pathway for
tgf-beta involves the smad proteins. during the past several
years, some important studies have highlighted the
therapeutic potential of antagonizing the tgf-beta pathway
[92-94]. thus, several large and small tgf-beta signalling
inhibitors are currently under investigation (antisense tgfbeta2 vaccine, novarx; ap-1200931, antisense pharma; ap1101432, antisense pharma; ly550410, lilly; ly580276,
lilly; sb-505124, glaxosmithkline) [95-97].
future directions
future studies will investigate combinations of targeted
agents or single multi-target agents, such as  xxxd86xxx 
(targeting egfr1, egfr2,  xxxg1274xxx ; novartis), bay 439006 (sorafenib, targeting  xxxg1924xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx , pdgf-rbeta;
bayer),  xxxd3264xxx  (targeting pdgf-r, vegfr, c-kit-r,
 xxxg801xxx -r; sugen), or zd6474 (targeting vegfr and
egfr; astrazeneca), designed to inhibit multiple
mechanisms of tumor growth, in addition to conventional
chemotherapy [98-101]. this should counteract the problem
of resistance, make it possible to tackle tumors with
complex kinase profiles, and possibly result in greater
antitumor activity. recent animal data already suggest that
combined inhibition of the egfr and vegfr pathways
