background.  xxxd2834xxx , a highly selective and potent  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
with a strong binding afﬁnity and a long plasma elimination half-life (approximately
40 hours), has shown efﬁcacy in phase ii trials in preventing chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting (cinv) resulting from highly emetogenic chemotherapy. the
current phase iii trial evaluated the efﬁcacy and safety of  xxxd2834xxx  in preventing
acute and delayed cinv after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.

methods. in the current study, 592 patients were randomized to receive a single,
intravenous dose of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, or  xxxd1924xxx 
100 mg, 30 minutes before receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. the
primary efﬁcacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a complete response
(cr; deﬁned as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) during the ﬁrst 24
hours after chemotherapy. secondary endpoints included assessment of prevention of delayed emesis (2–5 days postchemotherapy).
results. in the current study, 569 patients received study medication and were
included in the intent-to-treat efﬁcacy analyses. cr rates during the ﬁrst 24 hours
were 63.0% for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg, 57.1% for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, and 52.9%
for  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg. cr rates during the delayed period (24 –120 hours after
chemotherapy) were superior for  xxxd2834xxx  compared with  xxxd1924xxx . adverse
events (aes) were mostly mild to moderate and not related to study medication,
with similar incidences among groups. there were no serious drug-related aes.
conclusions. a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  is as effective as a single dose of
 xxxd1924xxx  in preventing acute cinv and superior to  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing
delayed cinv after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, with a comparable
safety proﬁle for all treatment groups. cancer 2003;98:2473– 82.

t is well established that the majority of cancer patients who undergo moderately or highly emetogenic cytotoxic treatment without receiving prophylactic antiemetics will experience chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting (cinv). although the
exact mechanisms of cinv are not fully known, it is
clear from preclinical experiments and more than 15
years of clinical investigations that serotonin plays a
major role in initiating nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy. emetogenic
chemotherapy damages the gastrointestinal mucosa,
causing the release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine
[5-ht]) from enterochromafﬁn cells in the small intestine, which, in turn, activates 5-ht3 receptors located on vagal afferents.1 activated vagal afferent ﬁbers send signals to the brain stem vomiting centers,
initiating emesis.1 the introduction of  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists into clinical oncology in the 1990s led to
signiﬁcant improvements in control rates for acute
nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy, and  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists are now
considered part of the standard of care. as single
agents for antiemetic prophylaxis of acute cinv (occurring within 24 hours of chemotherapy) in patients
receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy,
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists are reported to have complete response (cr) rates (i.e., no emesis, no use of
rescue medication) of 50 –70%.2 although they are
commonly prescribed after the ﬁrst day of chemotherapy, the effectiveness of  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists as

single agents in preventing delayed cinv (occurring
⬎ 24 hours after chemotherapy) associated mainly
with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and (to a lesser
extent) with other chemotherapeutic agents is less
well established. four  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists are
currently approved for use in the united states and/or
europe: ondansetron, granisetron,  xxxd3451xxx , and
 xxxd1924xxx . these agents have some pharmacologic
differences in receptor binding afﬁnity, selectivity, and
metabolism. despite these nuances, the minor pharmacologic differences of these agents have not translated into clinically meaningful differences among
them. therefore, according to current evidence-based
guidelines (american society of clinical oncology,
multinational association of supportive care in cancer) and consensus guidelines (american society of
health-system pharmacists, national comprehensive
cancer network), these  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
are considered therapeutically equivalent and interchangeable when used at equipotent doses.3–7
although  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists are part of
the current standard of care for patients receiving
chemotherapy, a substantial proportion of patients
today continue to experience both acute and particularly delayed cinv after moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.7,8 therefore, there is still a need
to develop new agents to improve control rates and
patient care. although other neurotransmitter pathways besides serotonin are clearly involved in cinv
(e.g.,  xxxg2240xxx  and the neurokinin-1 receptor

efﬁcacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in cinv/eisenberg et al.

mechanisms),9 one question has not been fully explored: will major pharmacologic improvements in a
novel  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist lead to improved
clinical outcomes in patients receiving emetogenic
chemotherapy compared with a currently available
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist?
 xxxd2834xxx  is a highly potent, second-generation, selective  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist. it has been
shown to have approximately a 100-fold stronger
binding afﬁnity for the  xxxg1116xxx  compared with
other agents in the class10 and an extended plasma
elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours. a
dose-ranging phase ii trial of  xxxd2834xxx  designed
to identify the minimal effective dose(s) was performed in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. two doses were identiﬁed for phase iii
investigation.11 the objective of the current phase iii
trial was to evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of single,
ﬁxed, intravenous (i.v.) doses of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg
and 0.75 mg compared with a single i.v. dose of  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg in preventing acute and delayed cinv
after administration of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.

on day 1, eligible patients were randomized to
receive a single, ﬁxed, i.v. dose of one of the following
three treatments, administered as a bolus over 30 seconds, 30 minutes before the primary chemotherapeutic agent:  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75

and emesis also was permitted. subjects were followed
for 15 days. the study protocol received approval from
the institutional review board or independent ethics
committee at all investigational sites and was performed according to the declaration of helsinki.

study visits and assessment procedures
baseline procedures were documented at a prestudy
screening visit within 7 days preceding day 1. patients
were assessed on three additional visits (day of study
medication administration [day 1] and two follow-up
visits [day 2 and days 6 – 8]) and by two telephone
contacts [days 5 and 15]. patient diaries were used to
record emetic episodes, use of rescue medication, severity of nausea (evaluated daily until day 5 via a
4-point likert scale ranging from 0 [none] to 3 [severe]), and patient satisfaction with antiemetic therapy
(evaluated daily until day 5 via a 100-mm visual analog scale ranging from 0 [not at all satisﬁed] to 100
[totally satisﬁed]). the validated functional living index-emesis (flie) questionnaire, which speciﬁcally
addresses the impact of nausea and emesis on daily
functioning and quality of life (qol),12 was completed
by the patient on day 2 (to evaluate the ﬁrst 24 hours
postchemotherapy) and day 5 (to evaluate days 2– 4
postchemotherapy). safety was assessed by recording
adverse events (aes; on site for 3 hours after study
drug administration on day 1 and at all subsequent
contacts), vital sign measurements, laboratory tests
(hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis), physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg) performed 24 hours and 1 week after study drug administration. a subset of patients (n ⫽ 30) had an
additional ecg evaluation 15 minutes after study drug
administration. the observation period for aes was 14
days after study drug administration for all aes and 30
days for serious aes.

efﬁcacy parameters
the primary efﬁcacy endpoint in the current study
was the proportion of patients considered to have
achieved a complete response (cr; deﬁned as no
emetic episode and no use of rescue medication) during the ﬁrst 24 hours after chemotherapy administration (acute period). emetic episodes were recorded in
standard fashion (unpublished data, 2003). secondary
endpoints included the proportion of patients with a
cr during the delayed (24 –120 hours) time period
(days 2–5) and the overall (0 –120 hours) time period
(days 1–5), as well as during successive 24-hour time
periods (i.e., 24 – 48, 48 –72, 72–96, and 96 –120 hours);
the proportion of patients with complete control (cc;
deﬁned as no emetic episode, no need for rescue
medication, and no more than mild nausea) during

the acute, delayed, and overall time periods, as well as
during successive 24-hour time periods; the number
of emetic episodes, time to ﬁrst emetic episode, time
to ﬁrst administration of rescue medication, time to
treatment failure (time to ﬁrst emetic episode or administration of rescue medication, whichever occurred ﬁrst), severity of nausea, patient global satisfaction with antiemetic therapy, and qol (flie).

statistical analysis
the primary efﬁcacy hypothesis of the study was that
at least 1 dose of  xxxd2834xxx  was noninferior to the
 xxxd1924xxx  dose using a maximum delta of 15% for a
cr at 24 hours. the number of patients to be included
in the study was estimated based on the assumption
of a responder rate of 70% in the  xxxd2834xxx  and
 xxxd1924xxx  groups and a difference of no more than
15% in the cr rate. for a 1-sided test of equivalence (␣
⫽ 0.0125), a sample size of 180 evaluable patients per
group was needed to ensure 80% power for each comparison (overall power, 90%). the number of patients
was increased to 197 per group to account for the
projected drop-out rate.
cohorts for the analyses included an intent-totreat (itt) cohort, a per protocol (pp) cohort, and a
safety cohort. the primary analysis was performed on
the itt cohort, which included all randomized patients who received chemotherapy and study medication. the pp cohort included all patients who completed the study at least until day 1 and who were
compliant with the study protocol. the pp analysis
was performed for the primary efﬁcacy parameter,
demographic data, and baseline characteristics. the
safety cohort included all treated patients who had at
least one safety assessment after treatment with study
drugs.
to assess noninferiority and adjust multiple comparisons for the primary endpoint of a cr rate at 24
hours, the lower bound of the 2-sided 97.5% conﬁdence interval (ci) for the difference between the cr
rates between each  xxxd2834xxx  dose and  xxxd1924xxx 
was compared with a preset equivalence difference of
⫺15%. logistic regression was implemented to evaluate the inﬂuence of gender, chemotherapeutic history,
corticosteroid use, and country/region of study on cr
rates. the 24-hour rates were also compared directly
using the fisher exact test with an adjusted signiﬁcance level of 0.025. comparisons of cr rates at secondary time points (i.e., 24 –120 hours, 0 –120 hours,
and daily for days 2–5) were made using the same
statistical methods as for the primary variable.
complete control and the proportion of patients
receiving rescue medication were analyzed using the
chi-square test. treatment group comparisons of the

efﬁcacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in cinv/eisenberg et al.

number of emetic episodes and the severity of nausea
were analyzed using the kruskal–wallis test or the
wilcoxon test. in addition, post hoc analyses of the
proportion of patients with no nausea and no emesis
(variables recoded as none or any) were performed
using the chi-square test. a poisson regression analysis was performed for the number of emetic episodes,
taking into account the use of rescue medication.
treatment group comparisons of time to ﬁrst emetic
episode and time to treatment failure were analyzed
using kaplan–meier estimates and the log-rank test.
the equivalence of the two  xxxd2834xxx  doses, with
respect to cr during the ﬁrst 24 hours and during all
of the time periods, was tested in an exploratory way
(␣ ⫽ 0.05). the bounds of the 2-sided 95% ci of the
difference between the proportions of cr in the two
doses were compared to the preset threshold (⫾ 15%).
laboratory values were analyzed using categoric
changes from baseline with respect to toxicity grades.
toxicity grades were generated for hematology and
blood chemistry parameters, displaying the data for
the comparison baseline values versus the last value
available. changes in laboratory values were investigated within each group using the wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test. vital signs and physical examination data were listed and summarized. ecg data
were summarized, highlighting the differences from
the baseline values for quantitative variables and the
frequencies of treatment-emergent abnormalities. in
particular, qt/qtc mean changes from visit 1 (baseline) were calculated at each time point, including the
maximum mean change from visit 1. other safety data
were analyzed descriptively. all statistical analyses
were performed using sas software (version 6.12; sas
institute, cary, nc).

results
patient characteristics
patients were evaluated between may 2000 and december 2001 in 61 centers in north america (united
states and mexico). five hundred ninety-two patients
were randomized to receive a single i.v. dose of one of
three treatments, although nine of these patients did
not receive treatment. treatment groups received  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg (n ⫽ 194),  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg (n
⫽ 196), or  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg (n ⫽ 193). of the 583
patients treated, 14 were excluded from the itt analysis: 1 due to receipt of chemotherapy with unacceptably low emetogenic potential and 13 due to enrollment at a disqualiﬁed investigative site. therefore, 569
patients were included in the itt cohort analysis.

history, and corticosteroid use was similar among all
treatment groups. the distribution of patients was
similar according to ethnicity and alcohol consumption. eighty-two percent of study patients were female. the most common types of malignant disease
included breast carcinoma (approximately 64%), lung
carcinoma (approximately 8%), and non-hodgkin
lymphoma (approximately 4%). the majority (67%) of
patients were chemotherapy naive. approximately 5%
of patients received pretreatment with a corticosteroid
(secondary to a late protocol amendment allowing
concurrent corticosteroids). there were no relevant
differences between treatment groups with respect to
comorbid medical conditions (renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular impairment) or karnofsky index. of the
chemotherapeutic treatments received on day 1 by
the itt cohort, regimens containing anthracycline
and cyclophosphamide were the ones that were most
commonly administered, to 64% of patients (table 3).
the median dose of doxorubicin was 50 mg/m2 for all

primary efﬁcacy endpoint
the proportion of patients with a cr during the ﬁrst
24 hours was numerically higher in the  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg group (63.0% vs. 52.9%; 97.5% ci for the
difference, [⫺1.7%, 21.9%]; p ⫽ 0.049) and in the  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg group (57.1% vs. 52.9%; 97.5% ci
for the difference, [⫺7.7%, 16.2%]; p ⫽ 0.412) compared with the  xxxd1924xxx  group (table 4, fig. 1). the
primary hypothesis of noninferiority (i.e., equal or better efﬁcacy) of both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  compared
with  xxxd1924xxx  was proven for cr rates during the
0 –24-hour period, as the lower bounds of the 97.5% ci
of the difference between  xxxd2834xxx  and  xxxd1924xxx  were greater than the preset threshold (table 4,
fig. 1).

secondary efﬁcacy end points
signiﬁcantly higher cr rates were observed for both
doses of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with  xxxd1924xxx  during the delayed period (24 –120 hours) and the overall
period (0 –120 hours; table 4, fig. 1). comparisons of
cr rates for delayed cinv during individual days revealed signiﬁcantly higher rates for both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with  xxxd1924xxx  on days 2 and 3
and on day 4 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg. cc rates were
also signiﬁcantly higher for the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg
and  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg groups compared with  xxxd1924xxx  during the delayed 24 –120-hour period
(48.1%, 51.9%, and 36.1%, respectively; p ⫽ 0.018 and
p ⫽ 0.002 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and 0.75 mg vs.
 xxxd1924xxx , respectively) and during the overall 0 –120hour period (41.8%, 42.9%, and 30.9%, respectively; p
⫽ 0.027 and p ⫽ 0.016 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and
0.75 mg vs.  xxxd1924xxx , respectively). in addition, signiﬁcantly higher cc rates were observed for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and 0.75 mg compared with  xxxd1924xxx 

on day 2 (55.0% vs. 40.3%, p ⫽ 0.004 and 57.7% vs.
40.3%, p ⫽ 0.001, respectively) and day 3 (62.4% vs.
48.2%, p ⫽ 0.005 and 68.3% vs. 48.2%, p ⫽ 0.001,
respectively), with superiority also observed for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg on day 4 (80.4% vs. 67.0%, p
⫽ 0.003).
superiority of  xxxd2834xxx  compared with  xxxd1924xxx  was observed throughout the study for additional secondary end points. patients treated with  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg had signiﬁcantly fewer emetic
episodes compared with those treated with  xxxd1924xxx 
during the acute (p ⫽ 0.0135), delayed (p ⫽ 0.0183),
and overall (p ⫽ 0.0036) periods. this also was the
case for patients treated with  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg
compared with patients treated with  xxxd1924xxx  during the delayed (p ⫽ 0.0002) and overall (p ⫽ 0.0016)
periods. consistent with this ﬁnding, signiﬁcantly
more patients treated with  xxxd2834xxx  had no
emetic episodes during these delayed and overall intervals (p ⫽ 0.028 and p ⫽ 0.014 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25
mg and p ⫽ 0.001 and p ⫽ 0.004 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75,
respectively). in addition, there was a greater proportion of patients with no emetic episodes on individual
days 1, 2, and 5 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg and on days
2 and 3 for  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg compared with  xxxd1924xxx  (fig. 2). the proportion of patients with no
nausea was also signiﬁcantly greater in both  xxxd2834xxx  groups on days 2 and 3 (p ⬍ 0.05) and for
 xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg on day 4 as well (p ⫽ 0.002)
(fig. 3).
for all time points or intervals not mentioned, a
similar trend favoring  xxxd2834xxx  compared with
 xxxd1924xxx  was observed, although this difference did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance. time to ﬁrst emetic
episode and time to treatment failure were signiﬁcantly longer for both  xxxd2834xxx  doses compared
with  xxxd1924xxx  (p ⬍ 0.05). the median time to ﬁrst
emetic episode was more than 120 hours for both
 xxxd2834xxx  doses versus 41.5 hours for  xxxd1924xxx .
the median time to treatment failure for both  xxxd2834xxx  doses was more than twice as long as with
 xxxd1924xxx  (51.1, 52.8, and 24.6 hours, respectively;
fig. 4). results for additional secondary efﬁcacy parameters not described in the current study will be
presented in subsequent publications.
both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  were equivalent for
almost all efﬁcacy assessments, suggesting that the
0.25 mg dose may be on the plateau of the doseresponse curve. there was little additional incremental beneﬁt beyond this dose.

and chemotherapeutic history (stratiﬁcation criteria)
showed expected trends in efﬁcacy differences. compared with females, male patients tended to have
higher cr and cc rates, less nausea, and longer times
to ﬁrst emetic episode. male patients also needed less
rescue medication. it is noteworthy, however, that
males accounted for only 18% of the patient population. compared with chemotherapy-naive patients,
nonnaive patients showed a trend toward higher cr
rates during the 0 –24-hour period ( xxxd2834xxx  0.25

had experienced no more than mild nausea. this
might tend to select patients with less risk for subsequent problems with nausea or emesis after emetogenic chemotherapy. compared with patients who did
not receive corticosteroids, those who received corticosteroids showed a trend toward higher cr rates in
the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg group (72.7% vs. 62.4%) and
in the  xxxd1924xxx  group (62.5% vs. 52.5%), but not in
the  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg group (50.0% vs 57.6%).
however, because only approximately 5% of patients
received corticosteroids, these ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution.

in the duration of aes commonly associated with
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonist therapy (i.e., headache,
constipation, diarrhea, fatigue) in patients treated
with  xxxd2834xxx  compared with  xxxd1924xxx . most
(⬎ 80%) aes were not related to the study drug and
there were no relevant differences between groups
with regards to treatment-related aes (i.e., adverse
reactions; table 5). the most common adverse reactions in all three treatment groups were headache and
constipation.
the incidence of serious aes was low and there
were no relevant differences between groups (2.1% [n
⫽ 4] of patients in the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg group,
6.7% [n ⫽ 13] in the  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg group, and
4.6% [n ⫽ 9] in the  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg group). none of
the serious aes reported were related to study medication. three patients died during the observation
period (1 in the  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg group and 2 in
the  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg group). all deaths were attributed to cancer progression. no clinically relevant
differences were found between treatment groups
with respect to laboratory test results, vital sign
changes, and ecg ﬁndings. as an example, the mean
postdose change in qtc interval (fridericia correction) from baseline was 3.4, 3.2, and 5.4 msec for
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg,  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg, and  xxxd1924xxx , respectively.

discussion
the current study provides evidence that major pharmacologic differences in a novel  xxxg1116xxx  an-

efﬁcacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in cinv/eisenberg et al.

tagonist,  xxxd2834xxx , may translate into improved
outcomes in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. several features of the design of
this clinical trial are worth exploring. first, we chose to
enroll a heterogeneous population of patients receiving commonly administered, moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy and did not limit the study to patients
who were chemotherapy-naive. the higher response
rates for patients who were chemotherapy-experienced are most likely related to the eligibility criteria.
patients with previous chemotherapy experience were
allowed into the study if, according to the investigator,
the patient had no more than mild nausea with previous chemotherapy. this exclusion of patients with
more severe nausea from previous chemotherapy
could explain the higher response rates to either  xxxd2834xxx  or  xxxd1924xxx  in this subpopulation compared with the chemotherapy-naive subpopulation.
second, study drugs were given only on day 1 as single
i.v. doses, which allowed us to explore the duration of
 xxxd2834xxx  efﬁcacy in the prevention of nausea and
emesis during the 24 –120-hour period (delayed
phase) after chemotherapy.  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg produced numerically superior cr rates compared with
 xxxd1924xxx  100 mg during the acute period. however,
for both the delayed and overall periods, as well as at
each time point after 24 hours until 72 hours after
chemotherapy, both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  administered as a single i.v. dose on day 1 demonstrated both
clinical and statistical superiority to a single i.v. dose
of  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg. this was observed consistently
for all efﬁcacy assessments. at 72 hours after chemotherapy administration, the efﬁcacy differences among
the regimens disappeared, most likely because of the
considerably reduced risk of delayed emesis after
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy after this time.
the  xxxd2834xxx  doses used in the current study
were based on a phase ii dose-ranging study, which
showed  xxxd2834xxx  3.0 ␮g/kg (ﬁxed dose of approximately 0.25 mg) to be the minimally effective dose for
the prevention of highly emetogenic cinv. doses up
to 90 ␮g/kg (ﬁxed dose of approximately 6.0 mg) were
also safe and effective (unpublished data, 2003). findings from the phase ii study supported the selection of
3.0 ␮g/kg and 10 ␮g/kg (corresponding to ﬁxed doses
of approximately 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg, respectively)
for use in the current phase iii study. results of the
current study showed that these two  xxxd2834xxx 
doses were similar in overall efﬁcacy, conﬁrming that
the 0.25 mg dose is on the plateau of the efﬁcacy
dose-response curve. in addition, both doses of  xxxd2834xxx  were similar to  xxxd1924xxx  in the incidence,
pattern, and duration of reported aes, most of which
were mild and not related to study medication. there

2481

were also no clinically relevant differences between
 xxxd1924xxx  and  xxxd2834xxx  with respect to laboratory, ecg, or vital sign changes.
because cinv can persist for several days, a 5-ht3
receptor antagonist with a prolonged duration of
action could be valuable. a phase ii study showed
that  xxxd2834xxx  maintains efﬁcacy in preventing
cinv for some days after highly emetogenic chemotherapy.11 the  xxxg1116xxx  binding afﬁnity of  xxxd2834xxx  is approximately 100-fold greater than others in its class, making it more potent than other
receptor antagonists (pki 10.45 for  xxxd2834xxx  vs.
7.6 for  xxxd1924xxx , 8.39 for ondansetron, and 8.91 for
granisetron).10,13 in addition, the extended plasma
elimination half-life of  xxxd2834xxx  (approximately
40 hours)14 is substantially longer than ﬁrst-generation agents ( xxxd1924xxx , 7.5 hours; ondansetron, 4.0
hours; and granisetron, 8.9 hours).15–17 the strong
 xxxg1116xxx  binding afﬁnity of  xxxd2834xxx  and
prolonged half-life are potential explanations for its
prolonged antiemetic activity. the prolonged efﬁcacy
of  xxxd2834xxx  seen in the current phase iii trial is in
agreement with the phase ii ﬁndings.
in conclusion, the current study has demonstrated that single, ﬁxed, i.v. doses of  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg and 0.75 mg are effective and safe in preventing moderately emetogenic cinv.  xxxd2834xxx  was
more effective than single-dose  xxxd1924xxx  in preventing acute and delayed cinv. with its extended duration of action, excellent safety proﬁle, and high response rates,  xxxd2834xxx  is a safe and potentially
more effective alternative to currently marketed ﬁrstgeneration  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists.
