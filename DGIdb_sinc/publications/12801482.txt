glucosamine sulfate modulates the levels of  xxxg33xxx  and  xxxg1437xxx  synthesized by cultured human osteoarthritis articular chondroc...  the functional integrity of articular cartilage is determined by a balance between chondrocyte biosynthesis of extracellular matrix and its degradation. in osteoarthritis (oa), the balance is disturbed by an increase in matrix degradative enzymes and a decrease in biosynthesis of constitutive extracellular matrix molecules, such as collagen type ii and  xxxg33xxx . in this study, we examined the effects of the sulfate salt of glucosamine (gs) on the mrna and protein levels of the proteoglycan  xxxg33xxx  and on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-3 in cultured human oa articular chondrocytes.
