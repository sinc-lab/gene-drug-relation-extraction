abstract  xxxd1781xxx  (csa) is an immunosuppressive cyclic peptide that binds with a high affinity to 18 kda
human  xxxg798xxx -a (hcypa). csa and its several natural
derivatives have some pharmacological potential in treatment of diverse immune disorders. more than 20
paralogues of  xxxg1809xxx  are expressed in the human body
while expression levels and functions of numerous orfs
encoding  xxxg798xxx -like sequences remain unknown.
certain derivatives of csa devoid of immunosuppressive
activity may have some potential in treatments of alzheimer diseases, hepatitis c and hiv infections, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, congenital muscular dystrophy, asthma
and various parasitic infections. here, we discuss structural
and functional aspects of the human cyclophilins and their
interaction with various intra-cellular targets that can be
under the control of csa or its complexes with diverse
cyclophilins that are selectively expressed in different
cellular compartments. some molecular aspects of the
cyclophilins expressed in parasites invading humans and
causing diseases were also analyzed.

introduction
the archetypal  xxxg798xxx -a has been discovered to be a
 xxxd1781xxx  (csa) [1] binding protein [2] with catalytical activity for accelerating cis/trans isomerization of
x-pro epitopes in model peptides [3, 4]. several different
groups of proteins exhibit peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase (ppiase) activity including the immunosuppressive
macrocycle (fk506) binding proteins, known as the
fkbps [3, 4]. in a historical sense, the name ‘ xxxg798xxx ’
implied cyclic peptide (csa) binding protein, but this may
now be misleading since some  xxxg798xxx -like domains
(clds) of diverse proteins do not bind csa, although they
may still have ppiase activity [3, 4].  xxxg798xxx -a
( xxxg1809xxx ), one of its paralogues residing in the endoplasmic
reticulum ( xxxg798xxx -b, cyp-b), and a 40 kda multidomain  xxxg798xxx  (cyp-40) have been isolated in sizable
quantities which indicate that some members of the
 xxxg798xxx  family of proteins are abundantly expressed in
different mammalian organs [2, 5, 6]. multiple other paralogues of the human  xxxg1809xxx  have been cloned and some of
their physico-chemical properties and biological functions
established [3, 4]. sequencing of the human genome has
revealed that it encodes multiple  xxxg798xxx -like open
reading frames (orfs) whose expression profiles and
biological functions, if any, remain to be elucidated [7].
likewise, exact biological functions and interaction networks in which are involved the human paralogues of the
archetypal hcypa remain far from being well established
[3, 4]. although considerable progress has been made in
molecular characterization of some cyclophilins expressed
in diverse parasites invading humans [8], the knowledge of
functional aspects of the differentiated repertoires of the
cyclophilins expressed in numerous parasites remains
scarce [8–10].

several members of the  xxxg798xxx  family of proteins
are high affinity binders of the immunosuppressive drug
csa (thus called immunophilins) [3, 4]. biochemical and
immunological assays aided by analyses of the structural
aspects of the hcypa/csa complex bound to the calcineurin phosphatase have revealed its plausible
physiologically relevant modes of action [11–14]. on the
pubmed server at the national centre of biotechnology
information (ncbi) (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), one may
find nearly 5,000 references on the cyclophilins, whereas
about ten times that number, nearly 43,500 on 21 april
2010, concern different aspects of diverse medical applications of csa and its analogues [7]. for example, csa
and some of its derivatives are often utilized in pharmacological interventions against some immunological
disorders and in organ transplantation [1, 3, 4, 12, 15].
the  xxxg798xxx -like domains (clds) contain from 145
to 180 amino acid residues (aas) and have highly diversified sequences, but retain a significant conservation of
ppiase activity site [3]. the closed b-barrel folds of the
clds display a high level of structure conservation [16,
17]. the generic ppiase activity, however, is a property of
the multiple paralogues of the archetypal  xxxg1809xxx  that could
imply that those paralogues fulfill some crucial biological
functions other than cis/trans isomerization of x-pro bonds
[3, 4]. moreover, it has been shown that the surface patches
distant to the ppiase cavity can bind some epitopes [18].
various cyclophilins have been localized to different cellular compartments where they are involved in a multitude
of complexes, thereby their structures must comprise some
patches having the capacity to bind diverse epitopes of
intra-cellular entities [3]. it could be postulated that the
spatial arrangement of different structural elements within
the nominal  xxxg798xxx  ‘fold’ supply some plasticity to the
surface patches distant to the ppiase cavity that have the
capacity to bind various epitopes. in this review, we
present analyses of the sequences and structures of the
human cyclophilins and their orthologues expressed in
some parasites. our analyses unraveled some inter-connections between differentiation of their sequences and
variations within the intra-molecular interaction networks
[19]. also, some functional aspects of the cyclophilins and
their interactions with diverse cellular entities that could be
in part under the control of csa and its derivatives were
discussed.

csa is a hydrophobic cyclic peptide (fig. 1a) that is soluble in some organic solvents and only sparingly soluble in
aqueous solution [3, 4, 20, 21]. some cyclophilins dissolved in aqueous solution can quickly sequester added
csa with a concomitant loss of their ppiase activity [3, 4].

csa displays significant conformational polymorphism
that is dependent on the chemical composition of the solvent [20–23]. for example, csa dissolved in chloroform
has four internal hydrogen bonds and its conformation is
different if bound to hcypa [23]. the residues of csa

interacting with hcypa are shown in fig. 1b and are listed
in table 1a.
csa and the archetypal hcypa rapidly form a high
affinity complex (1cwa.pdb) that is believed to be the
principal vector of therapeutic actions of the immunosuppressive drug [3, 12]. at least 78 inter-molecular atomic
distances below 4.0 å were calculated from the hcypa/
csa complex; the aas of hcypa that are shaded in
table 1b form the hydrophobic ppiase cavity (fig. 1c)
[24]. some of the atomic contacts below 3 å give rise to
hydrogen bonding between csa and the atoms in r55,

n102 and w121 in hcypa (ts1_dist_all file containing a
list of molecular interactions in the complexes listed in
table 1 is in the electronic supplementary material, esm).
csa bound to hcypa buries about 50% (fig. 1c) of its
hydrophobic surface [17, 23, 25–27]. we calculated the
root-mean-square distance (rmsd) for the entire  xxxg798xxx  structure comprising a free form of hcypa (2cpl.pdb)
[16] and its complex with csa (1cwa.pdb) [25], and
separately for the aas in its ppiase cavity. two aas in the
ppiase activity site of hcypa, namely r55 and q111, and
several other residues such as t5, s21, k31, f67-t68, were

3470

affected by the binding of csa. different peptides
and proteins bind to the clds at lm kd [4, 27, 28]. the
aas of hcypa having inter-molecular atomic contacts
(d b 4.0 å) with a peptide substrate suc-ala-gly-pro-phepna bound to hcypa (1zkf.pdb) [29], and a gag protein
from hiv-1 bound to hcypa (1m9c.pdb) [30] are shown
in table 1b which illustrates that the csa-binding site
overlaps with the peptide binding site.
diverse experiments showed that the mammalian  xxxg1809xxx 
effectively catalyzes only cis/trans isomerization of pro-x
epitopes while its catalytical power is highly diminished if,
in place of pro, there is a six- or four-member ring [3, 4, 31,
32]. moreover,  xxxg1809xxx  does not catalyze isomerization of a
secondary amide peptide bond [33, 34]. both ppiase assays
and phage display technique showed that hcypa has a significant preference for catalyzing and binding gly-pro
epitopes in linear peptides [35, 36]. among 400 different
dipeptides (diads), only 20 have a pro in the second position;
there are 8,000 triads and 160,000 tetrads that can be formed
from 20 natural amino acids [two files containing tabulated
data on aa diads (ts1) and triads (ts2) computed from the
human genomic database are in the esm]. analyses of the
human genomic database revealed that gly-pro is a highly
represented diad that is often found in b-turn spatial motifs
of many proteins [37]. proline residue is a particular amino
acid that, despite its highly hydrophobic nature, has the
highest solubility level in aqueous solution in the series of 20
natural amino acids [38]. specific affinity of pro residue to
the ppiase cavity may be due to both its hydrophobicity [38]
and ring puckering [39], that allow it to well adapt itself to
the geometric constraints of the ppiase binding site.
binding constants for  xxxg798xxx /drug complexes are
usually expressed using ic50 (the half maximal inhibitory
concentration at which 50% of activity is abolished), ki (the
dissociation constant for binding of inhibitor to enzyme) that
can be calculated from a series of inhibition curves using one
of the available software [3, 4, 40, 41], and kd (binding
constant) that can be estimated from binding experiments
using, for example, tritiated csa and a molecular filtration
column [2]. experimental conditions and methods used for
the establishment of the inhibition constants usually influence the ic50, ki or kd values. for example, the kis for the
hcypa/csa complex may vary in certain ranges according
to the methods employed for their establishment, namely the
kis vary from 30 to 2 nm. also, chemical modifications of
csa may weaken its binding to  xxxg1809xxx  concomitant with the
loss of its immunosuppressive activity. curiously, it was
shown, however, that several chemical modifications in both
sides of csa, namely side ‘pp’ which binds to  xxxg1809xxx 
(fig. 1b) and side ‘c’ interacting with calcineurin, may
enhance its immunosuppressive profile [42, 43].
the csa/ xxxg1809xxx  complex binds with a high affinity to the
ternary complex formed with calcineurin-a (cna),

a. galat, j. bua

calcineurin-b (cnb) and calmodulin (cdl) (table 1a) and
inhibits its phosphatase activity [11, 12]. analyses of the
x-ray data of the hcypa-csa/(cna-cnb) complex
showed that the csa residues from 4 to 8 have atomic
contacts with cna and cnb, and thus their modifications
may interfere with the tight binding in the ternary complex
[13, 14]. thus, some chemical modifications of residues
from 4 to 8 of csa (side ‘c’, fig. 1b) may alter its
immunosuppressive activity and produce non-immunosuppressive analogues. moreover, several different natural
structural variants of csa have been characterized, such as
csh and csg, and many synthetic derivatives of csa have
been assayed for their potentially interesting pharmacological properties in treatment of different diseases [1, 12,
15, 44–47]. some of those compounds apparently bind to
various hydrophobic entities, such as human  xxxg10xxx 
p-glycoprotein  xxxg22xxx  or human fpr1 formylpeptide receptor [44, 45].  xxxg1809xxx  also binds several other
natural molecules such as sanglifehrin-a (sfa) that was
isolated from streptomyces a [48, 49], cymbimicins isolated from actinomycetes [50], or cyclolineopeptide a
(cla) isolated from linseed oil [51]. cla has weaker
binding constant to  xxxg1809xxx  (kd = 125 nm) that is almost
one order of magnitude lower than for the csa/ xxxg1809xxx 
complex (kd = from 2 to 30 nm). however, cla complexed with  xxxg1809xxx  binds to cna/cnb at kd ten times
weaker than does the hcypa/csa complex, which limits
its potential application as an immunosuppressive drug.
sfa binds to  xxxg1809xxx  with an ic50 = 6.9 nm (fig. 2) that is
lower than ic50 = 20 nm for csa, but it does not inhibit
the cna/cnb complex and acts as a tolerance inducer in
t cells [52, 53].
it is worth mentioning, however, that due to the extreme
hydrophobicity of csa and its natural analogues, they may
weakly bind to other proteins and diverse hydrophobic
moieties [3]. for example, it was shown that  xxxg562xxx 
and actin weakly bind at lm ranges to csa which might
suggest that these are rather non-specific interactions [55,
56]. the diversified binding modes and conformational
polymorphism displayed by csa, its natural analogues and
other hydrophobic compounds that bind to the various
cyclophilins could imply that they might impinge activities
of a multitude of cellular entities [3, 4, 12].
conservation of the primary structure
of the human clds
analyses of several different multiple sequence alignments
(msas) of the clds from different phyla revealed that the
aas, being in the sequence positions equivalent to those of
the ppiase activity site of hcypa, remain well conserved
[57]. fig. fs1 (in esm) shows an msa of the human clds
with the aas (in bold face) that are crucial for the ppiase

molecular aspects of cyclophilins

fig. 3 information entropy (ie) histogram for the human clds (see
esm fig. fs5). low ie values indicate that thye given sequence
position is well conserved (a low variability in the aac) whereas the
ie c 1.0 indicate for a higher variability of the aac at the given
sequence position (maximal ie for 20 natural aas equals to
log220 = 4.322)

activity whereas in esm fig. fs2 is shown the msa of 496
sequences comprising various clds from diverse organisms. it has been shown that the clds from different phyla
contain a considerable content of f residues (10–15%) [3].
in consequence, high conservation levels ([0.8) and
information entropy ie \ 0.9 were calculated for some of
the f and y residues involved in the hydrophobic interaction networks [19]; a plot of ies for the human clds is
shown in fig. 3. the low ie values indicate that the given
sequence position is well conserved (a low variability in
the amino acid composition, aac), whereas the ie c 1.0
indicate a higher variability of the aac at the given
sequence position. although the averaged sequence similarity scores (ids) in the analyzed msas of the
cyclophilins are below 40%, some sequence patches crucial
for the ppiase activity and fold-structuring interaction
networks remain highly conserved (ies b 1.0).
analysis of the aligned sequences of the human clds
(esm figs. fs1 and fs2) revealed that the aas crucial for
ppiase activity and the ‘aromatic/hydrophobic’ aas network are well conserved in all the 19 sequences (msa19)
of the human clds. for example, the equivalent sequence
positions occupied by r55 in hcypa, that is critical for its
catalytic activity, are well conserved in the sequences of
the human clds (msa19). it has, however, been recently
shown that the r55/a55 substitution in hcypa did not
apparently influence the folding rate of carbonic anhydrase,
which implies that r55 is crucial for the ppiase activity
only if a linear peptide substrate is being used, while the
protein itself behaves as a chaperone capable of rescuing
misfolded molten globule intermediates [58, 59]. likewise,

the cld of hcyp58 binds a gly-pro epitope of a linear
peptide but does not influence its cis/trans equilibrium
[54]. r55 was replaced by a p residue in the hcyp18c
isoform, whereas in hcyp57 an r residue is positioned two
aas downstream. no data, however, exist to show whether
the cld of hcyp57 has ppiase activity. q63 (hcypa) is
crucial for ppiase activity in the cyclophilins, and it is
conserved in all the aligned sequences with the exception
of the hcyp18c isoform, whereas the highly conserved
q111-f112-f113 triad (hcypa) is also well conserved in
the msa19. w121 (hcypa), a crucial aa in the ppiase
activity site in hcypa, is replaced in several human clds
by h or y residues which may significantly alter the kd
with csa and its derivatives [3]; see also esm fig. fs3.
subtle variations within the intra-molecular interaction
networks in the clds
several x-ray structures of the cyclophilins [60] that are
listed in esm table ts3 were analyzed with the cordan_pro program, and triangular distance maps were
generated for each of the structures [19]. the distance
maps computed from the structures of hcyp19 (1qoi.pdb,
upper triangle), that is involved in some stages of formation of the spliceosome [18], and the archetypal hcypa
(2cpl.pdb, lower triangle) are shown in fig. 4a, whereas
in fig. 4b are shown the x-ray structures (ribbon display)
with the explicitly indicated spatial positions of some
aromatic aas and several others from the ppiase cavity.
the interaction networks of the aromatic residues are
shown as red dotted lines; those networks also involve c,
v, i and l (violet dotted lines). the aromatic/hydrophobic
aas network seems to have a substantial structuring
capacity in the  xxxg798xxx ’s fold [3]. these two maps
(fig. 4a) have similar distributions of the intra-molecular

whereas lower parts were taken

interaction clusters to that shown in shown in esm table
ts1 which indicate that the tertiary structures of the clds
are well conserved [17]. orange, green and blue rectangles
in the sequences axe at the top of fig. 4a (esm fig. fs4a is
its high-resolution pdf image) correspond to a-helix,
b-turn and b-strand structures, respectively. interactions
between b-strands in anti-parallel b-sheets that are close in
the sequence form the perpendicular clusters (blue arrows)
close to the diagonal, whereas the interactions between
b-strands that are distant in the sequence form the clusters
that are distant to the diagonal. atomic interactions within
a-helices are local, and thus their clusters (yellow arrows)
are parallel to the diagonal of the 2d map; the remaining
near-diagonal elements contain all the interactions between
the neighboring aa-residues (close in the sequence).
b-sheets and a-helices interact with diverse loops and
b-turns and form specific clusters and super-clusters of
interactions (color ellipsoids). for example, supercluster-2
(a salmon oval) is made up of three mini-clusters, namely:
(1) b-strand 8 interacting with the loop linking b-strands 2
and 3; (2) the b-turns flanking b-strand 3 interacting with
the b-turns in front of b-strand 8; and (3) a-helix 3 interacting with the b-turns following b-strand 4. the remaining
three super-clusters consist of from 2 to 5 mini-clusters
comprising diverse interactions between some elements of
the secondary structure with the loop regions. some
b-strands have sparsely distributed networks of interactions, for example b-strand 6 (blue dotted lines).
distribution of the numbers of distances and the sum of
the van der waals (vdw) and coulombic energy terms
calculated per aa residue [19] in hcyp19 (1qoi.pdb) are
shown in fig. 5. the aas having higher than average
energy contributions are indicated in the graph whereas at
the bottom of each residue are given their equivalents in
the sequence of the archetypal hcypa. the majority of the

aas indicated in the graph are crucial in the ppiase
activity, binding of csa, and ‘aromatic/hydrophobic’ aa
network. for example, r67 corresponds to r55 in hcypa
and is crucial for cis/trans isomerization of x-pro epitopes
in model peptides [4]. it is preceded by a highly conserved
y60 (y48 in hcypa) and is followed by q75 (q63 in
hcypa) that are a part of the ppiase activity site. as shown
in fig. 5, the aas participating in the ‘aromatic/hydrophobic’ network and being a part of the ppiase activity
site contribute significant stabilization energy terms. the
aas crucial for ppiase activity and structuring aromatic/
hydrophobic network have the most significant vdw and
coulombic contributions to stability of the structure.
analyses of 2d distance maps of different cyclophilins
revealed that the ‘aromatic/hydrophobic’ network consisting of 12 aas in the archetypal hcypa (f7, f8, f22, f36,
y48, f53,  xxxd977xxx , f112, i114, f129, i158, c161) remains
well conserved in the majority of its human paralogues (see
esm table ts4) although not all of them exhibit cis/trans
isomerization activity with standard peptide substrates; the
sequence positions equivalent to the above hydrophobic
network of the aas are well conserved in the different
msas of the cyclophilins [3, 56]. larger differences were
derived from the comparison of the interaction patterns of
the free forms of hcypa (2cpl.pdb) and hcyp19
(1qoi.pdb) which implies that the aa substitutions caused
some subtle changes in the fold. comparing the two
structures yielded rmsd = 0.344 for the ca atoms of the
‘aromatic/hydrophobic’ aas network and rmsd = 0.274
for the ca atoms of the aas in the ppiase activity site.
despite the id = 53% for hcyp19/hcypa, the low values
of the rmsds indicate for a good conservation of the spatial
positions of these two groups of crucial aas.
the ies for the aas forming the ppiase activity site are
small in the msa containing 496 sequences of the clds

3474

a. galat, j. bua

(msa496; esm fig. fs5), and in msa19 (fig. 3). however, there are multiple subtle aa changes taking place in
each functional sub-group of the clds [57]. even if relatively few aa substitutions took place in the triads
comprising the aas implicated in ppiase activity and in
the aromatic/hydrophobic aas network (see esm fig.
fs3), the aa triads become highly variable inbetween the
conserved patches of aas reaching the high ies at particular sequence positions. we hypothesize that these highly
variable sequence patches are the sites of functional optimization of diverse physicochemical properties of the
clds, such as ppiase activity levels, structural stability,
spatial distribution of charged aas, hydrophobicity of
binding surface patches, and its affinity to diverse epitopes.
diversified binding sites of the clds
inter-molecular distances calculated from x-ray structures
of several ternary complexes between diverse clds and
their ligands were summarized in table 1. hcypa/csa
binds to cna/cnb complex (1m63.pdb [13] and 1mf8.pdb
[14]) in a somewhat different fashion than is the case for
the hfkbp12a/fk506 complex bound to cna/cnb [62].
figure 6a shows the structure of the ternary complex
(hcypa/csa ? cna/cnb) in which csa is embedded
inside its interior (csa is shown in red sticks marked with
an arrow). there are multiple contacts between the residues
of csa and cna, whereas a smaller number of them exist
between csa and cnb (ts1_dist_all file in esm).
the hiv gag protein binds to the ppiase cavity of
hcypa with x-pro bond in a cis conformation as shown in
the structure on fig. 6b (1m9c.pdb) [63, 64]. there are
numerous atomic contacts between the peptide and ppiase
activity site that are similar to those existing in a complex
between  xxxg798xxx  and a model peptide suc-agpf-pna
bound to  xxxg1809xxx  (1zkf.pdb) (table 1b). the solution [65]
and x-ray [18] structures of the complex between a peptide
coming from the u4/u6 snrnp-60k protein, which is
known to interact with the spliceosomal  xxxg798xxx 
hcyp19 [18], have revealed that the interaction network
between the peptide and hcyp19 involves the aas that are
distant to its ppiase cavity; fig. 6c shows the x-ray
structure of the hcyp19/(the u4/u6 peptide) complex
(1mzw.pdb).
sequence attributes of the clds and some biological
functions of the multidomain cyclophilins
table 2 summarizes essential data, such as physicochemical properties, chromosomal localization and some of the
biological functions of the human cyclophilins. the pdb
codes are for human cyclophilins with two exceptions,
namely for mus musculus (mm) and bos taurus (bt). only

9 cyclophilins are mono-domain but their sequences are
highly diversified. the remaining 11 expressed forms of
the human cyclophilins contain distinct domains such as
40-residue trp-asp containing b propeller repeat domain
(wd40), tetratricopeptide repeat (tpr), rna-binding

molecular aspects of cyclophilins

(rrm), leucine-rich repeat (lrr), nucleporin domain
(nup), really-interesting-gene-product (ring) domain,
and serine/arginine-rich (sr) domains that are crucial for
assembly of spliceosomal complexes. for example, tpr,
wd40 and lrr motifs are involved in protein–protein
interactions, ring domain is a zinc-finger probably
involved in interaction with dna, rrm interacts with
rnas, and nup domain is crucial for nucleoporin
(hcyp358) forming pores in the nuclear membrane. known
cellular localizations are also indicated, namely nuclear,
cytoplasmic, secreted form, membrane associated, and
mitochondrial protein. overall binding capacity of the
cyclophilins to csa are coded as strong for kd or
ki b 50 nm, weak for these two values larger than 400 nm,
and unknown if no experimental value was established.
the clds have the overall hydrophobicity (hi) ranging
from low values, e.g., for the hydrophilic orthologues of
hcyp58, to the highly hydrophobic membrane-associated
 xxxg1810xxx ,  xxxg1811xxx , cypf and the spliceosome-associated
hcyp19 [18, 57]. the overall hydrophobicity (hi) of some
cyclophilins is very low which is due to a high content of
charged aas in the sr domains. the cyclophilins are
present in different cellular compartments where they are
involved in diverse biological functions such as assembly
of mrna splicing supracomplexes [73, 81], mitochondrial
pore regulation [77–80], association to different molecular
channels [85], and functioning as chaperone and folding
co-factors [3].
human trim5a is one of more than 70 tripartite motifcontaining proteins that may impede hiv-1 replication. it
has been shown that the cells of some monkeys living in
south america express a fusion protein containing
trim5a and a cld that probably is one of the host factors
restricting hiv-1 proliferation in the animal [92]. multiple
human orfs have very similar sequences to those of the
clds in the trim5a- xxxg798xxx  fusion proteins that are
expressed in the apes. perhaps, due to evolutionary pressure, one of the human orfs encoding a homologous cld
could undergo a gene fusion with the human trim5a gene
and such a fusion protein would become a host restriction
factor against hiv-1 infection [93].
the cyclophilins and diverse human diseases
numerous reports have appeared on the involvement of
 xxxg1809xxx  and its diverse paralogues in functioning of different
cellular entities [3, 4], some of which are summarized in
table 2. in this section, we discuss just four issues: (1)
csa-induced immunosuppression; (2) extracellular activities of some cyclophilins; (3) hypothetical involvement of
 xxxg1809xxx  in some stages of diseases caused by hiv-1 and
hcv; and (4) cyclophilins and development of cancer
cells.

csa-induced immunosuppression
the mechanism of csa-induced suppression of t cell
activation by antigen-presenting cells (t cell anergy) was
proposed about two decades ago [11, 94]. it was postulated
that the hcypa/csa complex binds to calcineurin and
blocks its phosphatase activity that causes the retention of a
phosphorylated form of the transcription factor called
nuclear factor for activation of t cells (nf-at) in the
cytosol [11]. pull-down experiments revealed that the
hcypa/csa [11] and murine  xxxg1811xxx  (mcypc)
complexed to csa were capable of binding calcineurin
[94]. this would suggest that some of the paralogues of the
archetypal hcypa complexed to csa, such as hcypb/csa
or hcypc/csa, could bind to the phosphatase and block its
active site. the membrane-associated mcypc was not the
physiologically relevant target for csa since only the
cytosolic  xxxg1809xxx  bound to csa supposed to be responsible
for the inactivation of cna/cnb in t cells, although no in
vivo evidence was supplied to support such a mechanism
of action [95]. moreover, it should be mentioned that
 xxxg1809xxx  is an abundantly expressed protein whose ppiase
activity cannot be entirely abolished in vivo since the
concentration of csa or its analogues would have to reach
pharmacologically unacceptable levels [2, 5]. this would
imply that the immunosuppressive effect of csa in t cells
could become effective because the expression level of the
cna/cnb phosphatase is low.
although the  xxxg1809xxx  gene is non-essential for mammalian
cell viability, its knock-down rendered the mouse resistant
to the immunosuppressive effects of csa [96, 97]. nothing
was, however, established about what other effects could
be induced by csa in the mouse with the  xxxg1809xxx (-/-) gene.
for example, it would be relevant to establish if csa binds
to the extracellular pool of mcypb and if the complex may
enter into t cells in the animal. were some cellular processes controlled by the other paralogues of mcypa
affected by csa in mouse with the  xxxg1809xxx (-/-) gene?
extracellular effects of the cyclophilins
 xxxg1810xxx  is the major component of the extracellular pool of
the cyclophilins, namely a sizeable quantity of  xxxg1810xxx  (ca.
20 lm), was found in the plasma [98, 99]. it could be
secreted together with certain extracellular proteins and it
should be able to sequester some quantity of the in vivoadministered csa. it was also shown that a modified form
of csa anchored to the surface of t cells could exert its
immunomodulatory effects [100], as negatively charged
csa derivatives rest in the extracellular space [101]
whereas csa binds well to the membranes in a temperature-dependent fashion [102]. if csa binds to the
extracellular pool of hcypb, then such a complex has two

molecular aspects of cyclophilins

crucial attributes for entering into the cell’s interior,
namely the large exposed hydrophobic patch of csa should
have some affinity to the hydrophobic environment of the
membranes while the positively charged patches of  xxxg1810xxx 
should induce a substantial driving force for entry into t
cells. to what extent the extracellular pool of the hcypb/
csa complex formed in vivo may enter into t cells and
induce immunosuppression remains to be investigated
[103].
hcypb was shown to be involved in cell adhesion [104].
osteogenesis imperfecta is a disease causing growth deficiency and reduced bone mass. this particular deficiency
could be due to a mutation in the  xxxg1810xxx  gene encoding
hcypb [105, 106]. although the level of the extracellular
 xxxg1809xxx  was too low for detection by an elisa assay [94], it was
claimed that the secreted form of hcypa is crucial for matrix
assembly by hensin that is involved in epithelial differentiation [107]. large numbers of secreted gene products [7] and
extracellular domains (ecds) of various receptors could
interact with the extracellular pool of the small ppiases. but
what exact biological effects could be due to those myriads
of potential intermolecular interactions? extracellular
matrix re-organization, differentiation of cells, and their
growth and proliferation are dependent on in vivo locally
secreted gradients of growth factors (morphogens), proteases and other crucial factors [108, 109]. perhaps the
extracellular forms of hcypa and hcypb have an overall
housekeeping function rather than exerting a profound
influence on some crucial biological events. assessment of
functional interactions between the recombinant forms of
the cyclophilins and distinct populations of cells under in
vitro conditions, in some cases could have been misleading
due to sizeable contamination of the former by the bacterial
lypopolysaccharide (lps), a powerful inducer of diverse
cellular effects. for example, another abundantly expressed
small protein found both in the interior of the cell and in the
extracellular space, called macrophage migration inhibitory
factor (mif), had been considered to be a cytokine, although
its biological activity was proven to be induced by the
associated bacterial lps [110, 111]. it should be noted,
however, that  xxxg1809xxx ,  xxxg1810xxx  and mif could be easily isolated
from natural sources in a relatively large quantity [2, 5, 112].
thus, application of  xxxg1809xxx  and  xxxg1810xxx  isolated from mammalian organs and free of lps for in vitro assessments of
their influence on diverse cells could resolve some doubts
caused by the usage of the recombinant lps-contaminated
cyclophilins expressed in e. coli.
 xxxg1809xxx  and infections caused by hiv-1
and hepatitis c viruses (hcv)
although hcypa was found to be associated with hiv-1
viruses, probably bound to the gag (ca) protein, the

3477

relevance of  xxxg1809xxx  for proliferation of hiv-1 virions have
remained enigmatic during the last 15 years [30, 68, 69,
113]. it has been suggested that binding of hcypa to the
ca protein shelters the latter from being sequestered by the
cellular factors trim5a/ref that may restrict replication of
hiv-1 [114, 115]. the whole-genome sirna interference
experiments have pinpointed numerous intracellular targets
that are crucial for different stages of the hiv-1 live cycle
such as uncoating of the hiv-1 virus, its intracellular
transport and integration with the host dna, transcription
of its 15 genes, assembly of genetic material as its coating,
and, finally, budding of newly assembled viral particles
from the host cell [115–117]. it is unknown if  xxxg1809xxx  or
some of its minor isoforms are crucial for any of the
multiple candidate proteins established with the sirna
technique [116, 117].
non-immunosuppressive analogues of csa, namely
debio-025 or scy-635, may alter certain replication steps
of hcv [70, 71] and as such they could become useful as
an additional drug to fight hcv infections in humans.
these drugs could bind to the intracellular pool of  xxxg1809xxx 
and  xxxg1810xxx  and interfere with a hcv replication step.
however, debio-025 or scy-635 could suppress hcv
infection due to its interaction with one of the paralogues of
 xxxg1809xxx  whose expression level is low in the hepatocytes or
impair other cellular entities crucial for replication of
hcv.
cyclophilins, intra-cellular signaling
and development of cancer
even if  xxxg1809xxx  and some of its paralogues are highly
expressed proteins in human cells [2, 5], it has been suggested that they may be involved in some stages of cancer
cell development and proliferation [67]. recent reports
show that  xxxg1809xxx  interacts with tp53 and stat3 which are
powerful regulators of gene transcription [118].  xxxg1809xxx  is
also a crucial factor for cxcr4-activation transport of the
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a2 [66], a
spliceosomal rna-binding protein. the hydrophobic cavity of  xxxg1809xxx  and its different paralogues could be
associated to various exposed loops of proteins or receptors, but what physiological effects all those interactions
may have and to what extent those associations and their
possible disruption by csa could alter some cellular processes still remain unclear [3, 108]. the molecular events
leading to formation of primary cancer cells, such as
mutations of genes or other chromosomal alterations related to dna repair or deletion of chromosomal segments,
may create diversified populations of cancer cells [119–
122]. to what extent the heterogeneous transformations of
the genetic material leading to aberrant induction of gradients of morphogens and other auxiliary growth factors

3478

and extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes could be
controlled by the ubiquitous and abundantly expressed
 xxxg1809xxx  or its other isoforms still remain unexplored.
the cyclophilins in the protozoan parasites
affecting humans
basic information on the cyclophilins expressed in some
protozoan parasites affecting humans is summarized in
table 3. from 11 to 15 different cyclophilins isoforms
are encoded in the genomes of diverse parasites [9, 10].
figure 7 shows overall sequence organization of the
cyclophilins encoded in three different genomes that is
only to some extent similar to that of the human cyclophilins’ repertoire. the inhibitory constants for the
complexes between csa and diverse cyclophilins are
similar to that of the archetypal human  xxxg1809xxx /csa, which
limits the potential therapeutic application of the drug
against invading parasites [8, 124, 137].
it has been shown that the extracellular growth of
leishmania donovani is resistant to the actions of csa
which seems to be due to a low expression level of the
archetypal cytosolic  xxxg1809xxx  in this parasite [135]. it has also
been suggested that the mammalian host cell  xxxg1809xxx  seems
to be involved in the intracellular parasite’s replication
cycle of l. major parasites, as  xxxg1809xxx  sirna interference or
csa reduced the parasite burden [134]. some of the small
cyclophilins from plasmodium falciparum and toxoplasma
gondii (tgcyp18) have similar inhibitory profiles as those
established for the hcypa (table 3) [124, 126–129].
interestingly, tgcyp18 has the capacity to bind to the
cxcr5 receptor and block the hiv infectivity on human t
cells [129]. t. gondii also expresses an unusual protein
(tgfcbp57.3) containing one fkbp-like protein (n-terminus) and one cld (c-terminus) linked together via three
tetratricopeptide (tpr) motifs. both domains can bind to
csa and fk506, respectively, but only the fkbd/fk506
complex could inhibit the endogenous calcineurin [130].
knockdown of this dual family gene interfered with the
growth of the parasite [130].
in proteomic analyses of leishmania mexicana (lm),
belonging to trypanosomatids, lmcyp19, lmcyp22,
lmcyp28 and lmcyp40 paralogues were identified [133]
that are orthologues to the cyclophilins of t. cruzi (tc)
eluted from csa-affinity column [9]. the genome of
t. cruzi does not encode the fully conserved orthologues of
the human cyclophilins containing rna binding domains
probably due to the unusual type of mrna processing in
trypanosomatids, in which polycistronic transcripts are
processed to mature mrnas through trans-splicing [144].
in contrast, those orthologues are encoded in the genomes
of the apicomplexa parasites [10]. orthologous genes to
that encoding tccyp40, which is related to the heat shock

a. galat, j. bua

protein hcyp40, were also found in the genomes of l.
mexicana and l. major (fig. 7) [9].
it was demonstrated that csa has anti-parasitic activity
against a wide variety of parasites [8] with the exception of
leishmania that was resistant to the actions of csa [135].
figure 8 shows several derivatives of csa which proved to
exhibit anti-parasitic effects on cryptosporidium parvum,
plasmodium falciparum, trypanosoma cruzi and entamoeba histolytica (see table 3). curiously, some of these
compounds were more effective in inhibiting live functions
in the parasites than csa itself [137], and some of them did
not bind the cytosolic cyclophilins [142]. this would imply
that csa and its derivatives could exert their parasiticidal
effects that are not necessarily mediated by the archetypal
cytosolic  xxxg1809xxx . moreover, even if the tentative model of
immunosuppression in humans involves hcyp18a/csa
inhibition of phosphatase activity of calcineurin in t cells,
this model may not be valid in other organisms including
the parasites.
for example, evidence that the csa analogs with poor
or no immunosuppressive activity were parasiticidal also
argues against a mechanism involving calcineurin as the
target of various  xxxg1809xxx /(csa-derivative) complexes. it is
possible that anti-parasitic activity of csa could be due to
its binding to other targets such as p-glycoprotein (p-gp),
in which the some csa analogues proved to be potent
modifiers of its activity [123, 137, 142]. it was suggested,
however, that calcineurin was the target of csa complexed
to the cytosolic  xxxg798xxx  expressed in e. histolytica
[140]. some information about the properties of the cylophilins expressed in helminths is compiled in esm table
ts4.
even if more than three decades have elapsed since the
discovery of csa as an effective parasiticidal drug little is
so far known about the mechanisms of its anti-parasitic
activity. moreover, targeting of csa or its non-immunosuppressive derivatives to the archetypal  xxxg1809xxx  of the
parasites affecting humans cannot be done selectively since
hcypa and some of its isoforms are highly expressed in
diverse organs and tissues and are strong binders of those
molecules. thus, selective targeting of small natural [145]
or synthetic molecules to the minor isoforms of the
cyclophilins expressed in the parasites could become a
method for curing some human diseases (see table 3).
perspectives on selective targeting of the multiple
isoforms of the cyclophilins
multiple side effects observed in the long-term usage of
csa in organ transplant recipients, especially the severe
nephrotoxicity, remain one of the major obstacles for a
broader use of the drug in the treatment of inflammation
and other immune disorders [1, 3, 4, 15]. in fact,  xxxg1809xxx  is

highly expressed in kidneys with a large portion of it
tightly associated with the renal brush border membranes
[146]. non-immunosuppressive derivatives of csa display
some potential for being used in treatment of hiv-1 and
hcv infections [143]. but are they nephrotoxic? csa
derivatives are cytoprotective (in vitro and ex vivo) when
bound to hcypd [147, 148]. for example, despite the deep
differences between apoptosis and necrosis, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp) was found
to be involved in both types of cell death, but since the
mptp can be blocked by the  xxxg1812xxx /csa complex, then
cells are protected from injury and death [149]. pharmacological targeting of the cyclophilins could be useful for
treatments of alzheimer [148], huntington’s disease [150],
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [151], and congenital muscular dystrophy [152], whereas csa in aerosol form could
be useful in the treatment of asthma [153] and airway
inflammations [154].
despite more than twenty-five years of research on the
cyclophilins and their ligands still relatively few cyclophilins have been thoroughly investigated and many
singular findings have never been independently confirmed
or exploited [3, 4]. among the diverse communications
published to date only in a few of them have some
uncertain results been addressed. for example, it was
proven that the recombinant  xxxg1809xxx  does not have nuclease
activity [155] and the apparent activity recorded for the
recombinant forms of hcypa, hcypb and hcypc must
have been due to a nuclease contaminant from e.coli [156].
involvement of the calcium-modulating  xxxg798xxx  ligand
( xxxg331xxx ) in restriction of cellular release of the hiv-1
retroviruses seems to be doubtful [157, 158]. originally,
 xxxg331xxx  was found to be associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum-residing  xxxg1810xxx  [159].
if sfa and csa bound to hcypa cause different
immunological effects, then it would be interesting to know
if there are some other natural compounds that could bind
to hcypa and subtly influence different immune processes
than those controlled by sfa, csa and its various derivatives [160, 161]. there are no conclusive findings so far
on the selective targeting of the ppiase cavity in diverse
cyclophilins that function in various cellular compartments.
for example, elucidation of crucial functional aspects of
the nine cyclophilins (see table 2) involved in the
supraspliceosome assembly and other nuclear complexes
could open some ways for pharmacological intervention in
the transcription and splicing of the mrnas [162–164]. it
is still uncertain, however, to what extent the ppiases are
associated with different extracellular domains (ecds) of
some receptors [3, 108, 165], as well as which functions of
the intracellular proteins [166, 167] and their complexes
are dependent on particular members of the  xxxg798xxx 
family of proteins. rough estimates have revealed that

fig. 7 the human cyclophilins and their respective orthologues
encoded in the genomes of trypanosoma cruzi, plasmodium falciparum and toxoplasma gondii. the proteins were arranged according to

two criteria, namely (1) presence of similar domains, and (2) similar
sequence attributes for their respective clds in the cases where the
large cyclophilins were aligned with their small homologues

there are about 7,000 hydrophobic proteins some of which
are expressed on the cell surface [38, 168]. moreover, pro
residues account for about 6.5% of the total amino acid
composition of proteins encoded in the human genome, and
about 0.2% of the diads gly-pro occur in the human
sequences (see esm ts1) [168]. this could imply that
some of those residues in diverse proteins should be
accessible for binding to the ppiase cavity of the cyclophilins although it has been shown that linear peptides
containing the sequences of proteins that were proven to
bind to  xxxg1809xxx  do not always bind to the ppiase cavity [3, 4,
36]. it is thus crucial to find out what functional meanings,
if any, might those diverse complexes have involving the
cyclophilins, and if bound to csa or the other ligands
having high affinity to the cyclophilins [3], which cellular
effects could they produce.

virus although the latter  xxxg798xxx  lacks any ppiase
activity [170]. diverse paralogues of hcypa are present in
the nuclear compartment where they form complexes with
various entities including one of the most sophisticated
complexes known as the supraspliceosome entities [162].
our analyses of the msas, 2d distance maps and rmsds of
specific groups of aas, such as those involved in binding
of csa or being in the ‘aromatic/hydrophobic’ network,
revealed that there is a high sequence conservation of the
aas forming the ppiase cavity (esm fs3 and ts4).
moreover, the low ies indicate that some sequence positions remain highly conserved in the cyclophilins from
diverse phyla (esm fs5) despite multiple aa mutations
and gene duplication events that took place during evolution of living species. the highly conserved sequence
positions belong to two classes, namely (1) the aas crucial
for maintaining the structural integrity of the clds (the
extensive interaction networks of the hydrophobic aas),
and (2) functionally-crucial aas for ppiase activity and
specific interactions with diverse cellular targets [3]. the
conserved short patches of the aas are spaced with the aa
patches with low levels of sequence conservation that
impose the final pi and hydrophobicity of the given cld.

conclusions
the members of the  xxxg798xxx  family of proteins are
encoded in various genomes ranging from prokaryotes to
higher animals [3, 4, 57], including the genome of mimi

we hypothesize that subtly changed spectra of physicochemical characteristics, such properties as amino acid
(aa) hydrophobicity and bulkiness distribution, flexibility
of the polypeptide chain and charge distribution, of the aa
residues in the sequence patches with low sequence conservation induced ‘functional drift of sequence attributes’
[19]. in consequence, this ‘functional drift’ had to influence
the intra-molecular interaction networks in the closed
b-barrel fold of the clds [3] that adapted their overall
properties to: (1) recognition profiles of their specific targets (biological profiles) [3, 18, 36, 172], and (2) the microenvironmental conditions inherent to various intracellular

organelles (evolutionary niche). for example, the his of
the human clds (table 2) vary in a considerable range,
namely from 23% for hcyp58 (also known as hcyp60) to
48% for hcypc (fig. 9).  xxxg1811xxx ,  xxxg1810xxx  and cypf are the
hydrophobic proteins associated with the membranes,
whereas hcyp40 could interact with the membrane proteins via its hydrophobic tpr motifs [3, 168].
moreover, it could be theorized that the hydrophilic
cld of hcyp58, the hydrophobic cld of hcyp73 and the
extremely hydrophobic hcyp19 are the cyclophilins that
associate to specific spliceosomal entities using their optimized levels of hydrophobic patches (hi) on its surface and

that they are devoid of profound nephrotoxic activity. in
conclusion, in vivo-induced subtle interactions between the
cyclic peptide csa, and its non-immunosuppressive
diverse derivatives [179] and diverse targets remain
for thorough exploration. certainly, it is challenging to
selectively uncover in vivo essential extracellular and
intracellular vectors for csa and its derivatives and to
classify the multiple effects exerted by the drugs on diverse
in vivo relevant cellular events.

specific spatial charge distribution (pi). our analyses may
also indicate that fine alterations in the intra-molecular
interaction patterns within the cld’s fold are crucial for
their selective binding to diverse epitopes including csa
and its diverse analogues. whether subtle functional
changes in some cellular entities, such as neurotransmittergated ion channels [171] or cellular signalization cascades
[3, 12], are solely due to intrinsic temperature-driven cis/
trans isomerization of their x-pro epitopes (conformational
switches) is one possibility. another possibility is that they
may be due to a long-distance conformational allostery
induced by one of the ppiases [169, 172, 173]. unraveling
the fine structural basis of in vivo specificity of the
cyclophilins to their targets, however, would require a
sizable number of high-resolution x-ray structures of their
complexes with relevant cellular targets functioning in
various organelles.
diversified cellular effects induced by csa and its
derivatives and especially relevance of their in vivo aspects
that are dependent on the formation of various interaction
networks involving calcineurin, nf-ats,  xxxg2269xxx  and other
intra- and extracellular proteins are still at the beginning of
exploration [174–176]. the large number of the ecds
containing accessible proline epitopes and the multitude of
intracellular proteins that can be associated with the
cyclophilins imply that there may be myriads of subtle
cellular effects induced by csa and its derivatives. for
example, csa can be used as an immunosuppressive drug
[3, 4, 11], its derivative called  xxxd3488xxx  ( xxxd3488xxx ) [177,
178] may add enhanced retention of anticancer drugs in the
cell by blocking its p-gp activity, whereas some derivatives
as nim811 or debio-025 could be useful drugs for suppression of viral infections by hiv-1 and hcv provided
