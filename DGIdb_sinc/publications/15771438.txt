this paper examines the relative effectiveness of sulfamate and sulfamide groups for the
inhibition of carbonic anhydrase-ii ( xxxg293xxx ). topiramate (1) and its sulfamide analogue 4, and
4,5-cyclic sulfate 6 and its sulfamide analogue 5, were compared for inhibition of human  xxxg293xxx . a colorimetric assay, based on the ph shift that accompanies hydration of carbon dioxide,
and an esterase assay were used. for these bioisosteric pairs, 1/4 and 6/5, the sulfamate
compound was markedly more potent than its sulfamide counterpart. a similar, large difference
in potency was also observed for the sulfamate/sulfamide pairs 14/15 and 16/17. these results
indicate that the sulfamide moiety is not particularly suitable for obtaining potent carbonic
anhydrase inhibition. a discussion of this structure-activity relationship with respect to the
interactions of 1 and 6 with  xxxg293xxx  from published x-ray data is presented. a metabolic acidosis
study was performed in rats with 1, 4, 6, and 2, and the results are discussed with respect to
the degree of inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  in vivo.
carbonic anhydrase (ca, ec 4.2.1.1) is a zinc-containing enzyme that catalyzes a reversible reaction involving
the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of
bicarbonate: co2 + 2h2o a hco3- + h3o+.1-4 this
enzymatic reaction is essential to many physiological
anion-exchange processes,5 and ca inhibitors are effective drugs for the treatment of glaucoma by reducing
aqueous humor formation to lower intraocular pressure.3,6,7 of the three ca families, designated r, beta, and
gamma, the mammalian r-ca family encompasses 14 genetically distinct isozymes,  xxxg287xxx  through  xxxg292xxx , with
different tissue and intracellular distribution.4  xxxg293xxx ,
the most widely studied form, which is found in many
different organs and cell types, has very high catalytic
activity for co2 hydration. numerous potent inhibitors
of  xxxg293xxx , generally having a key primary sulfonamide
functionality, r-so2nh2, have been reported.3,8,9 the
sulfonamide in these compounds coordinates with the
tetrahedral znii atom in the enzyme active site, which
is also coordinated to the imidazole groups of three
histidine residues (his-94, his-96, and his-119 in human  xxxg293xxx ), thereby displacing the water/hydroxide
ligand that is intimately involved in co2 hydration.9,10
our interest in carbonic anhydrase enzymes derives
from working with topiramate (1),11 a novel sugar
sulfamate anticonvulsant that is marketed worldwide
for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine.12 following
our discovery of topiramate,11b,c we were prompted to
investigate its potential to inhibit ca because of the
presence of a sulfamate functionality (r-oso2nh2).
this effort entailed the use of ca isozymes derived from
different tissues and the determination of co2
hydration.11a,b,13,14 in a co2 hydration bioassay involving

( xxxg293xxx ), we found that topiramate is a moderate inhibitor with ic50 values of 8.9 or 1.4 µm, respectively.11a,16
also, topiramate is reported to be a moderate inhibitor
of purified human erythrocyte  xxxg293xxx , with a ki value of
5 µm, which is 125 times less potent than the value
obtained with the reference sulfonamide acetazolamide
(2).13,17 with respect to other ca isozymes, topiramate
is generally a moderate inhibitor, with ic50 or ki values
usually well above 100 nm.18 however, recent publications have reported low-nanomolar inhibition of human
recombinant  xxxg293xxx  (ki ) 5 nm) by topiramate via an
esterase assay (rather than a co2-hydration assay),
twice as potent as acetazolamide (ki ) 12 nm).19 the
study by casini et al.19a also brought to light some
sulfamide derivatives that are structurally related to
topiramate, and they found that close analogue 3 is
essentially devoid of  xxxg293xxx  inhibition in the esterase
assay (ki > 100 µm). by contrast, other sulfamides were
found to be potent  xxxg293xxx  inhibitors,19a,20 and the study
by abbate et al.20 also suggests that the sulfamide group
should be favorable for binding within the ca active site
cleft. because 319a differs from topiramate by having a

important to determine the  xxxg293xxx  inhibition for the

as its 4,5-cyclic sulfate congener, 5, which is the direct

can be sensitive to nucleophilic ring opening, especially
at higher temperatures such as 100 °c. because of the
cyclic sulfate group, the azide displacement step was
carried out at a lower temperature (23 °c) than that
used in the synthesis of 4. compounds 14-17 were
prepared in a straightforward manner (supporting
information).

results and discussion
synthesis. sulfamide 4, reported earlier,11a was
synthesized by an improved method, as outlined in
scheme 1. commercially available diacetone fructose
(daf) was treated with triflic anhydride to give triflate
7, which was immediately converted to azide 8 in near
quantitative yield. catalytic hydrogenation cleanly afforded the desired amine 9 in a superior yield (ca. 80%
from daf) compared with the previously reported
method (ca. 50%).11a reaction of amine 9 with sulfamide
in refluxing 1, xxxd1904xxx  gave target 4 in 75% yield,
which was far superior to the 20% yield obtained in the
original synthesis that employed sulfamoyl chloride and
sodium hydride. sulfamide 5 was synthesized in good
overall yield from alcohol 1011a in a similar manner, via
11-13 (scheme 2). it is remarkable that the sulfamide
reaction could be effected with high efficiency despite
the presence of the cyclic sulfate functionality, which

were tested for inhibition of purified human  xxxg293xxx 
obtained from erythrocytes (sigma chemical co.) by
using an assay involving the native action of the
enzyme, namely, the hydration of co2, via a ph-shift
measurement (table 1). sulfamates 1 and 6 inhibited
 xxxg293xxx  with ki values of 0.50 and 0.012 µm, respectively,
which compare with a ki value of 0.0033 µm for
acetazolamide (2), which is an expected level of inhibition for this reference compound and serves to validate
the enzyme assay (positive control). by contrast, sulfamides 4 and 5 exhibited comparatively weak  xxxg293xxx 
inhibition, with ki values of 650 and 20 µm, respectively.
from these data, the sulfamide-based bioisosteres, 4
and 5, are approximately 1000 times less potent than
their sulfamate counterparts, 1 and 6.

with the above confirmation of our earlier results
with 1 as an inhibitor of  xxxg293xxx , we became curious about
the much more potent  xxxg293xxx  inhibition reported for the
esterase method.19 in our hands, the esterase assay for
topiramate (1) and acetazolamide (2) afforded ki values
of 0.43 and 0.018 µm, respectively (table 1), instead of
0.005 and 0.012 µm, as reported by supuran and coworkers.19 the ki values in the esterase assay for
sulfamate 6 and sulfamides 4 and 5, were 0.038, 340,
and 25 µm, respectively. it is not clear to us what factors
are behind the observed discrepancy between the ki
values for 1 and 2 measured by each group, although
the source of  xxxg293xxx  is different (purified native vs.
recombinant21). fairly consistent results were obtained
between the two assay modes (table 1), except for
acetazolamide (2), which had a ph-shift ki value of
0.0033 and an esterase ki value of 0.018 µm. our results
for the l enantiomer of 1 and the l enantiomer of 6 in
the paired assays were also consistent (table 1).
sulfamates and sulfamides as inhibitors of  xxxg293xxx . although aryl and heteroaryl sulfonamides are
archetypal structures for inhibitors of carbonic anhydrases, sulfamate and sulfamide derivatives can also
give rise to potent inhibitors.11a,e,19-21 in an x-ray
crystallographic study of human  xxxg293xxx  complexed with
sulfamic acid and sulfamide, the parent core structures
for the sulfamate and sulfamide derivatives, respectively, the expected znii-nitrogen binding is reflected,
as are some new interactions resulting from the heteroatoms (o or n).20 these new interactions were
suggested to offer opportunities for the design of new
inhibitors. however, because sulfamic acid and sulfamide themselves are relatively weak inhibitors of  xxxg293xxx  (esterase assay ki values of 97 and 82 µm, respectively),19a,21 the relevance of those new interactions to
ca inhibitor design might be questioned. consequently,
it would be worthwhile to compare sulfamate and
sulfamide molecules that are strict bioisosteres and that
represent meaningfully potent inhibitors of ca. given
that the cyclic sulfate topiramate analogue 6 is a very
potent inhibitor of human  xxxg293xxx  with a ki value of 12
nm (table 1), it provides a suitable benchmark compound for the sulfamate species. however, its sulfamide
isostere, 5, has remarkably weaker human  xxxg293xxx  inhibitory activity (ki ) 20 µm; 1000-fold less potent). a
similar dichotomy is observed between the human  xxxg293xxx  inhibition of topiramate (1) (ki ) 0.50 µm) and that
of its sulfamide analogue, 4 (ki ) 650 µm; ca. 1000-fold
less potent). this pattern for the sulfamate/sulfamide
pairs also applies to the  xxxg293xxx  inhibition results from
the esterase-based assay (table 1).

the active site of human  xxxg293xxx .

since these substantial potency differences emanate
from sulfamate/sulfamide bioisosteric pairs, it would
appear that the sulfamide moiety is not especially
competent for obtaining potent inhibition of  xxxg293xxx .
considering the importance of this observation, we
sought to probe this issue further with some additional
sulfamate/sulfamide pairs. thus, we synthesized and
examined the pairs 14/15 and 16/17, which have some
structural distinction from the other pairs studied. in
this manner, we could gain support for the generality
of this effect.  xxxg293xxx  inhibition ic50 values for the pairs
14/15 and 16/17 were determined in the ph-shift assay.
sulfamate 14 and sulfamide 15 had ic50 values of 0.13
and 71 µm, respectively, and sulfamate 16 and sulfamide 17 had ic50 values of 0.28 and 129 µm, respectively. again, in the case where sulfamate compounds
are reasonably potent inhibitors of  xxxg293xxx , the corresponding sulfamide compounds are considerably less
potent, by a large factor of approximately 500.22
binding interactions of sulfamates 1 and 6 with
 xxxg293xxx . we have described the x-ray structure of sulfamate 6 complexed with human  xxxg293xxx ,11e the collected
interactions for which are depicted schematically in
figure 1. casini et al. have reported on the x-ray
structure of topiramate (1) complexed with human  xxxg293xxx ,19a the interactions for which are depicted in figure
2. the pyranose rings of 1 and 6 adopt the 3s0 skew
conformation (figures 1 and 2), which we have correlated with potent anticonvulsant activity.11a,e the key
interactions between each inhibitor molecule and the
ca active site are very similar for these two complexes
and dependent on this 3s0 skew conformation for a good
steric fit (figure 3). however, the two ligands manage
to dock into the active site of  xxxg293xxx  in a different
structural context (figure 3). the sulfamate nitrogen
of both 1 and 6 is coordinated to znii and hydrogen
bonded to the hydroxyl of thr199 in basically the same
manner. likewise, the binding modes of both 1 and 6
have the sulfamate oxygen hydrogen bonding to the
r-amino group of thr199 and the c2 oxygen of the 2,3-

acetonide ring hydrogen bonding to the side chain amino
group of gln92. in addition, various hydrogen-bonding
interactions occur between both inhibitors and key
residues of  xxxg293xxx : asn62, gln92, and thr200. however,
the binding modes of 1 and 6 differ in that the molecules
are rotated by ca. 180°, relative to each other, about the
sugar anomeric c-ch2 bond, i.e., the 2,3-ring of one
ligand has exchanged position with the 4,5-ring of the
other ligand. hence, the 4,5-cyclic sulfate of 6 is directed
toward the solvent and forms hydrogen bonds with two
water molecules and the hydroxyl of thr200. in addition, the c2 oxygen of the 2,3-acetonide and the pyranose ring oxygen of 6 form hydrogen bonds with the
amide side chain of asn62. by contrast, for 1 the 2,3acetonide is directed toward the solvent and hydrogen
bonded to a water molecule and gln92. in addition, the
c5 oxygen of the 4,5-acetonide forms a hydrogen bond
with the amide side chain of asn62. the difference in
binding modes for 1 and 6 can be rationalized by the
structural differences between each ligand. perhaps, it
is energetically more favorable for the more polar 4,5cyclic sulfate of 6 to be solvated (e.g., by water). this
viewpoint is consistent with the fact that the 4,5-cyclic
sulfate has three hydrogen bonding interactions (figure
1) and three associated water molecules, whereas the
colocalized 2,3-acetonide of 1 has only two hydrogenbonding interactions and one associated water molecule
(figure 2). the remarkable distinction in binding modes
for 1 and 6 underscores the flexibility that is available
in the design of active-site-directed inhibitors of  xxxg293xxx .
however, it is important to note that the active site of
 xxxg293xxx  does not accommodate the l isomers11a of 1 and
6 nearly as well as the d isomers, which is clearly
reflective of specific steric requirements (table 1). in
the ph-shift assay, the l enantiomer of 111a was ca. 20
times less potent than d isomer 1, and the l enantiomer
of 611a was ca. 80 times less potent than d isomer 6.
the weaker affinities of the l isomers of 1 and 6 relative
to the d isomers is consistent with our structural
analysis.

maryanoff et al.

the bridging sulfamate oxygen (ch2-o-s) does not
play a meaningful role in the binding of 1 and 6 with
 xxxg293xxx .11e,19a by contrast, in the complex of sulfamic acid
with  xxxg293xxx  there are important interactions of the
bridging sulfamate oxygen.20 it would appear that the
anionic properties of the oxygen in the sulfamic acid case
govern interactions within that enzyme complex and
thereby distinguish it from the sulfamate ester cases.
in the absence of interactions of the bridging sulfamate
oxygen of 1 and 6, how might one explain the poor
 xxxg293xxx  inhibitory activity of sulfamide bioisosteres 4 and
5, respectively? perhaps, the bioisosteric ch2nhso2
group has an altered conformation in the ligand such
that the terminal nh2 (or nh-) group cannot complex
effectively with the zn atom and still retain appropriate
hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions for the
rest of the molecule. another contributing factor could
be the difference in pka between the sulfamate and
sulfamide groups. for sulfamates 1 and 6, we determined pka values of 8.66 and 8.51, respectively, whereas
for sulfamide 4 we determined a pka value of 10.7.
because 4 is much less acidic, it will have a much lower
population of the anionic form that is required for
binding to znii in the active site of  xxxg293xxx .9,10,23
ca inhibition and topiramate’s antiepileptic
action. given the topic under discussion in this paper,
it would be instructive to consider the relevance of ca
inhibition to the antiepileptic activity of topiramate.
while attempting to elucidate the mechanisms of action
for topiramate, we suggested that in some forms of
epilepsy the inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  or  xxxg295xxx  may contribute
to the pharmacological activity.11d however, a crosstolerance study with acetazolamide and topiramate
indicated that inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg295xxx  is not a
major factor for topiramate’s anticonvulsant activity in
mice.11c also, when we conducted pharmacological studies in rats with sulfamate 6, which is much more potent
than topiramate as a  xxxg293xxx  inhibitor,11a we observed
frank diuresis and alkalinization of the urine, which is
characteristic of ca inhibition.24 such diuresis has not
been observed with topiramate in preclinical experiments or in clinical practice. however, there have been
clinical reports of metabolic acidosis, which presumably
emanates from inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  and possibly other
ca isozymes.25 to follow up on this point, we investigated the effects of topiramate (1), 6, acetazolamide (2,
positive control), and 4 (negative control) on the ph
values of arterial blood in rats. since inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  is likely to result in metabolic acidosis, with a dosedependent relationship, the blood ph readout should
reflect the degree of  xxxg293xxx  inhibition in vivo.26 with a
normal ph for rat blood of 7.40-7.43, the threshold for
metabolic acidosis would be a ph of less than 7.40.
we orally dosed adult male rats with 100 mg/kg of
topiramate, 6, acetazolamide, or 4, sampled their arterial blood 2 h later, and measured the ph. acetazolamide ( xxxg293xxx  ki ) 11 nm) gave a ph of 7.26 ( 0.06,
reflecting frank acidosis, whereas 4 (ki ) 650,000 nm)
gave a ph of 7.40 ( 0.03, reflecting a lack of activity
(essentially the same as the value for vehicle, ph ) 7.42
( 0.07). compound 6 (ki ) 12 nm) was very potent in
inducing acidosis (ph ) 7.25 ( 0.07), whereas topiramate (ki ) 500 nm) exhibited weak acidosis activity (ph

) 7.37 ( 0.04). our data indicate that the degree of
blood acidification, in terms of ph, is reasonably consistent with the level of  xxxg293xxx  inhibition for the compounds of interest. it is clear that topiramate causes
limited metabolic acidosis compared to the more potent
 xxxg293xxx  inhibitors. because topiramate does not manifest
strong inhibition of human  xxxg293xxx  in vitro and induces
just mild acidosis in rats in vivo, we suggest that other,
cns-based mechanisms are probably the dominant
factors in topiramate’s antiepileptic action.11d
conclusion
we examined some sulfamate/sulfamide bioisosteric
pairs to determine the relative effectiveness of the
sulfamate and sulfamide groups for inhibiting human
 xxxg293xxx . topiramate (1) and its sulfamide analogue 4, and
4,5-cyclic sulfate 6 and its sulfamide analogue 5, were
compared, and a dramatic difference in potency was
observed. this finding also applied to the sulfamate/
sulfamide pairs 14/15 and 16/17. given our results for
these sulfamate/sulfamide pairs, it would appear that
the sulfamide moiety is not particularly suitable for
obtaining potent carbonic anhydrase inhibition. our
study of metabolic acidosis in rats with topiramate (1),
6, acetazolamide (2), and 4, which reflects on the
inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  in vivo, indicates that topiramate
causes limited metabolic acidosis compared to the more
potent  xxxg293xxx  inhibitors, 6 and 2. thus, we suggest that
other, cns-based mechanisms are probably the principal source of topiramate’s antiepileptic action.

from sigma chemical co. inhibition of  xxxg293xxx  was determined
in a “ph-shift” assay performed according to the following
procedure.28 the experiments involved ca. 0.5 mg of  xxxg293xxx 
dissolved in 20 ml of water and then diluted 10-fold to 20fold with water (amount of  xxxg293xxx  per sample ) 0.1-0.2 µg).
the decrease in ph resulting from co2 and h2o being
converted to h+ and hco3- was measured by the change in
the color of the dye bromthymol blue. the reaction was
performed at 0-2 °c under conditions that allowed the
catalyzed reaction to reach an endpoint within 15-25 s and
the uncatalyzed reaction to reach an endpoint in 90-120 s. a
10 mm aqueous hepes solution was buffered to ph 7.7 at 23
°c with tris containing bromthymol blue (50 mg/l) and
dithiothreitol (160 mg/l). for the catalyzed reaction, the
contents of each sample included 0.5 ml of the buffered dye
solution, 0.1 ml of  xxxg293xxx  solution, 0.1 ml of test compound
solution (0.1 ml of water for catalyzed control samples), and
0.3 ml of fresh seltzer water. the temperature of the solutions
(final volume ) 1.0 ml) was maintained at 0-2 °c. for
uncatalyzed control samples, 0.1 ml of water was substituted
for the 0.1 ml of enzyme solution. the seltzer water was added
last to initiate the timed reaction. each sample was gently
mixed, placed in ice water, and gently mixed every 15-30 s
until the solution turned yellow, at which point the time was
recorded. each compound was tested in triplicate at each
specified concentration. test compounds were dissolved in
 xxxd1896xxx  at 100 mm and then diluted in water to a
concentration 10 times the final concentration in the test tube.
in this assay, the concentration of the substrate (co2) decreases from ca. 18 to 14 mm and, on average, is about twice
the concentration of the km for co2. by use of the chengprusoff equation,29 the ki value determined is approximately
1
/3 of the ic50 value. concentration-inhibition curves were

carbonic anhydrase inhibition. esterase assay. this
method was performed with purified enzyme (see above) and
is based on procedures described previously.30,31 stock solutions
of the substrate, 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-npa), were made
up in 95% ethanol at 4 mm. in most experiments, the reaction
medium was buffered using hepes (10 mm) adjusted to a
ph of 7.7 with tris. preliminary experiments showed that
similar catalytic activity was obtained by using tris cl- or
na+ phosphate as buffering agents. the reaction medium was
comprised as follows: 70 µl of buffer, 10 µl of test compound
(see above), 10 µl of 4-npa, and 10 µl of enzyme. water was
substituted for test compound or enzyme as appropriate to
establish the control catalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction rates.
in each experiment, compounds were tested in quadruplicate
by using 96-well plates at 23 °c. the reaction was initiated
by adding enzyme, and the reaction course was monitored at
400 nm. data for each sample was recorded at each minute
from 0 to 20 min. because the concentration of substrate (0.4
mm) was at least 25-fold lower than the km (>10 mm), the
ic50 values obtained were essentially the same as the ki
values.29,30 the data were analyzed as described above for the
ph-shift assay.
rat metabolic acidosis assay. male sprague-dawley
rats (250-300 g) were fasted overnight and dosed orally with
vehicle (0.5%  xxxd2609xxx ) or 100 mg/kg of topiramate (1),
acetazolamide (2), 6, or 4. arterial blood samples were collected
2 h postdosing. blood chemistries, including ph, were measured by using an istat portable clinical analyzer. the data
in the text represent the mean ( sd for each treatment group,
with eight rats per group (n ) 8).

(14) (a) a procedure that we used for ca inhibition relies on a color
change of a ph-sensitive dye, such as bromthymol blue.11a,15
hydrogen ions generated by the consumption of co2 cause a
decrease in ph with a concomitant change in color. reactions
were performed at 0-2 °c under conditions that led to an end
point for the catalyzed reaction in 10-20 s (the endpoint for the
uncatalyzed reaction occurred in 90-110 s). (b) another procedure that we used for ca inhibition relies on a mass spectrometric technique for co2 analysis.13,15 reactions were generally
performed at 25 °c.

effectively than the others. the ki values for  xxxg293xxx  and  xxxg295xxx 
ranged from 0.1 to 20 µm, depending on the species and the
temperature.13
