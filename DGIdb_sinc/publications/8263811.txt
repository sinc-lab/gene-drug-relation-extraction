nonadrenergic imidazoline binding sites on human platelets.  human platelets are shown to possess at least two high-affinity, imidazol(in)e-preferring binding sites that are pharmacologically distinct from alpha-2 adrenoceptors. these nonadrenergic sites were radiolabeled even in the presence of a 10 microm norepinephrine mask of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing [3h]idazoxan (idx) binding vs. [125i]p-iodoclonidine (pic) binding. nonadrenergic [125i]pic-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by [3h] idx were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic [125i]pic-labeled sites had bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the [3h]idx-labeled sites had bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microm norepinephrine mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for [125i]pic. affinities for the major nonadrenergic [125i]pic binding site were highly comparable to human subtype-i1 imidazol(in)e receptor sites in the brain stem (rank order:  xxxd2674xxx  > clonidine >  xxxd1707xxx  > idx > amiloride). however, the minor component of [125i]pic binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except  xxxd2241xxx . finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by [3h]idx, was consistent with a subtype-i2 imidazol(in)e receptor site (rank order:  xxxd1707xxx  > idx >> amiloride >  xxxd2674xxx  > clonidine). thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess imidazoline receptors (subtype-i1 imidazol(in)e receptor and subtype-i2 imidazol(in)e receptor), plus a novel  xxxd2241xxx -sensitive site, as well as an  xxxg88xxx . these nonadrenoceptor binding sites may explain certain novel platelet aggregatory properties previously ascribed to clonidine and endogenous clonidine-displacing substance(s), and may serve as markers of imidazoline receptors in humans.
