abstract: the kringle modules of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] of lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)] are highly
homologous with kringle 4 of plasminogen (75-94%) and like the latter are autonomous structural and
functional units. apo(a) contains 14-37 kringle 4 (kiv) repeats distributed into 10 classes (1-10). lp(a) binds lysine-sepharose via a lysine binding site (lbs) located in kiv-10 (88% homology with
plasminogen k4). however, the w72r substitution that occurs in rhesus monkeys and occasionally in
humans leads to impaired lysine binding capacity of kiv-10 and lp(a). the foregoing has been investigated
by determining the structures of kiv-10/m66 (m66 variant) in its unliganded and ligand [- xxxd146xxx 
acid ( xxxd146xxx )] bound modes and the structure of recombinant kiv-10/m66r72 (the w72r mutant). in
addition, the  xxxd146xxx  liganded structure of a sequence polymorph (m66t in about 42-50% of the human
population) was reexamined (kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx ). the kiv-10/m66, kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx , and kiv-10/
t66/ xxxd146xxx  molecular structures are highly isostructural, indicating that the lbs of the kringles is preformed
anticipating ligand binding. a displacement of three water molecules from the  xxxd146xxx  binding groove
and a movement of r35 bringing the guanidinium group close to the carboxylate of  xxxd146xxx  to assist  xxxd1097xxx 
in stabilizing the anionic group of the ligand are the only changes accompanying ligand binding. both
 xxxd146xxx  structures were in the embedded binding mode utilizing all three binding centers (anionic,
hydrophobic, cationic) like plasminogen kringles 1 and 4. the kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  structure determined
in this work differs from one previously reported [mikol, v., lo grasso, p. v. and, boettcher, b. r.
(1996) j. mol. biol. 256, 751-761], which crystallized in a different crystal system and displayed an
unbound binding mode, where only the amino group of  xxxd146xxx  interacted with the anionic center of the
lbs. the remainder of the ligand extended into solvent perpendicular to the kringle surface, leaving the
hydrophobic pocket and the cationic center of the lbs unoccupied. the structure of recombinant kiv10/m66r72 shows that r72 extends along the ligand binding groove parallel to the expected position of
 xxxd146xxx  toward the anionic center (d55/ xxxd57xxx ) and makes a salt bridge with  xxxd57xxx . thus, the r72 side chain
mimics ligand binding, and loss of binding ability is the result of steric blockage of the lbs by r72
physically occupying part of the site. the rhesus monkey lysine binding impairment is compared with
that of chimpanzee where kiv-10 has been shown to have a d57n mutation instead.

in human subjects, high plasma levels of lipoprotein(a)
[lp(a)]1 have been correlated with a high incidence of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (1-4). lp(a) is a
special class of ldl having as a protein moiety apo(a)
covalently linked to apob100 by a disulfide bond (5, 6). the

primary sequence of apo(a) shares a remarkable degree of
homology with that of plasminogen (7, 8). plasminogen, a
major protein of the fibrinolytic system, consists of an array
of five different kringle units (k1-k5) followed by a
protease domain that contains the catalytic triad of serine
proteases (9). apo(a) lacks the first three kringles of
plasminogen and contains from 14 to 37 kringle 4-like
repeats, referred to as kiv, distributed into 10 classes
designated 1 to 10, exhibiting 75-94% sequence homology
with plasminogen k4. kiv-9 contains an unpaired cysteine
(cys4057) that links apo(a) to one of the unpaired cysteines
(cys4326) in the c-terminal domain of apob100 (10, 11).
kiv-10 is followed by one copy of kv and a protease
domain, which have 91% and 94% sequence homology with
k5 and the catalytic domain of plasminogen, respectively
(7).
plasminogen is known to bind lysine-sepharose via the
lbs located in the k1 and k4 modules (12). lp(a) also binds

lysine-sepharose (8) but via the lbs located in apo(a) kiv10. this information has been derived from studies of
defective lysine binding lp(a) species from rhesus monkeys
(13) and the human r72 mutant (14) as well as wild-type
(w72) and mutant (r72) kiv-10 individually expressed in
escherichia coli (15, 16). the critical role of w72 in lysine
binding, which has emerged from the above observations,
is consistent with the results of the structure of ptk1 (17),
which has an r in position 72. this residue extends
diagonally across the region equivalent to the lbs, occupying it and sterically precluding binding of lysine-like ligands.
the same notion also emerges from the modeling of the lbs
of rhesus (13) and human mutant (18) kiv-10.
recently, chenivasse et al. (19) reported that the cterminal region of apo(a) of chimpanzee (pan troglodytes)
exhibits a high degree of homology with the corresponding
region of human apo(a). in turn, chimpanzee apo(a) differed
from the rhesus counterpart by having (1) an intact catalytic
triad in the protease region, (2) one copy of the kv motif,
and (3) w in position 72 in the lbs of kiv-10. however,
like the rhesus product, chimpanzee lp(a) was deficient in
lysine binding, a functional impairment attributed to the
presence of n instead of d in position 57 in kiv-10 (19). a
sequence polymorphism, m66t, in apo(a) kiv-10 has also
been reported in 42-50% of the human population (20, 21).
this mutation, however, is silent and causes no lysine binding
deficiency in lp(a).
the kringles of apo(a), like those of plasminogen, are
autonomous structural and functional modular units that
consist of a characteristic triple loop structure of approximately 80 amino acids cross-linked by three disulfide
bridges in the pattern 1-6, 2-4, and 3-5. kringle units are
also present in the noncatalytic region of a variety of other
distinct proteins involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. a single copy of a kringle exists in upa, vampire
bat plasminogen activator, and factor xii, while kringles are
found as pairs in prothrombin and  xxxg1766xxx  and as quartets in
 xxxg1044xxx  (22). the lbs of kringles, important in molecular recognition, binds lysine residues of several
different proteins, such as fibrin, r2-antiplasmin,  xxxg474xxx ,
and thrombospondin. these kringle-dependent interactions
can be competitively inhibited by lysine zwitterionic analogues such as  xxxd146xxx ,  xxxd302xxx , trans-(4-aminomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid and p-(aminomethyl)benzoic
acid. three-dimensional structures of uncomplexed and
liganded kringle domains of most of the foregoing kringles
have been determined by x-ray crystallography (ref 23 and
references therein) and by nmr methods (24, 25).
the lbs of plasminogen k1 (23, 26) and k4 (27, 28) is
characterized by short arrays of residues h33-r35 (h33k35 in k4), d55- xxxd57xxx , w62-f64, and  xxxd1097xxx -y74, which
together are arranged in a relatively open elongated surface
depression approximately 9 å wide and 12 å long. residues
w62, f64, w72, and y74 form a hydrophobic pocket
bounded by a negatively charged anionic subsite containing
d55 and  xxxd57xxx  at the top and a positively charged cationic
one containing r35 or  xxxg416xxx  and  xxxd1097xxx  at the bottom. the
anionic and cationic centers of the lbs stabilize the amino
and carboxylic groups of ligands (23, 28). the hydrophobic
pocket interacts with the methylene chain of omega-amino acids
so that all three binding centers of the lbs are simultaneously operative in an unrestricted way.

biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 7, 1999 1991
an unexpected binding mode was observed in kiv-10/
t66 complexed with  xxxd146xxx  (29) by the crystallography
group at sandoz pharma ag, basel, switzerland.2 in this
case, only the -amino group of the zwitterionic ligand was
reported to interact with the anionic binding center of the
kringle while the remainder of the ligand extended into the
solvent region, almost perpendicular to the surface of the
kringle, leaving the cationic site and the hydrophobic pocket
unoccupied. this binding mode (hereinafter called unbounded) and the corresponding structure might be expected
with plasminogen k5 where the r35i and r71l substitutions
in the lbs remove the cationic site of the kringle and could
thus force a ligand to solely occupy the anionic binding site
with a correspondingly larger kd (140 µm) (30). the
unbounded binding mode of kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  (29), however, is not consistent with biochemical studies, which clearly
suggest the embedded binding mode displayed by k1 and
k4 (23, 28). all three binding centers are present in kiv10/t66, and the kd value of  xxxd146xxx  (kd ) 20 µm) is similar
to those of plasminogen k1 (kd ) 13 µm) and k4 (kd ) 48
µm) (15). furthermore, the kd values of ligands in the
unbound mode should not differ significantly with the length
of the ligand because only the terminal -amino group
interacts with the anionic center. the measured dissociation
constants of kiv-10/t66 with 5-apa (kd ) 66 µm),  xxxd146xxx 
(kd ) 20 µm), and 7-aha (kd ) 230 µm) (15) suggest
otherwise and the embedded binding mode.
these anomalies and inconsistencies led us to reinvestigate
the binding mode of  xxxd146xxx  in the lbs of human kiv-10/
t66 during the course of a more extensive study of the
structures of the kiv-10/m66 variant in its free and ligandbound states, as well as determine the structure of the human
apo(a) kiv-10/m66r72 mutant. we report here highly
refined, high-resolution structures of these apo(a) kringles
that show (1) kiv-10/t66 can bind  xxxd146xxx  in the embedded
way, (2) in kiv-10/m66r72, the arginine mutation occupies
the lbs mimicking ligand, and (3) r35 shifts on  xxxd146xxx 
binding to assist  xxxd1097xxx  at the cationic center. the various kiv10 structures are also compared and their lbs correlated.
materials and methods
expression of apo kiv-10/m66w72 and r72 in e. coli.
the kiv-10/t66 expressed in e. coli (15) was provided by
dr. b. r. boettcher of novartis pharmaceuticals corp.,
summit, nj. the kringle contained four nonkringle amino
acid residues (gshm) resulting from the expression construct
in addition to three residues (vrq) preceding c1 of kiv10 and seven residues (sdtegtv) downstream from  xxxg178xxx 
of kiv-10.
kiv-10/m66 and mutant kiv-10/m66r72 were expressed
in e. coli as described previously (16) except that the pcr
primers c and f were replaced by primers 5′-ccggggatcccggcagtgctaccat-3′ and 5′-ccgggaattcttacacagtcccttc-3′, respectively, to minimize the
number of nonkringle residues. the dna fragments that
code for kiv-10/m66 and kiv-10/m66r72 were cloned into
the bamhi- and ecori-digested vector pgex-kg, which
was driven by the tac promoter and contained the coding

sequence for  xxxg1073xxx  (gst) (31). dna
sequences of wild-type and mutant kringles were confirmed
by using the femptomolar sequencing kit from promega
(madison, wi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
the kringles were expressed in the e. coli strain dh5a as
fusion gst proteins and separated from the gst fusion
component as previously described (16). n-terminal protein
sequencing of the expressed products was also performed
as described elsewhere (32). the expressed kringles contained two nonkringle residues (gs) resulting from the
expression construct in addition to two residues (rq)
preceding c1 of kiv-10 and seven residues (sdtegtv)
downstream  xxxg178xxx  of kiv-10. each of the expressed kringles
gave a single band by sds-page and reacted against an
anti-apo(a) kiv-10 polyclonal antibody (16). the kringles
were extensively dialyzed against 1 mm nh4hco3, lyophilized, and stored at -80 °c before use.
crystallization. relatively large crystals of the kiv
variant, with and without  xxxd146xxx , could be grown from
ammonium sulfate-peg 8000 solutions. their x-ray diffraction patterns, however, showed a complex splitting
pattern that could not be successfully interpreted and indexed.
all indications suggested that the apparently single crystals
were actually several small, similarly oriented, fused crystals.
consequently, hanging drops (2.0 µl) of hampton factorial
solutions were examined. excellent x-ray quality single
crystals of kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx  and kiv-10/t66/eaca3
could be readily grown from hampton condition 40 (table
1). however, crystallization of the other two kringles was
3 although the crystallization of unbounded kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  was
attempted following described procedures (29), the crystals proved to
be generally small and of marginal x-ray diffraction quality.

not successful with this condition. previous experience with
kringles suggested that peg 8000 as precipitant in a buffer
with ph around 7.0, with or without salt, might be suitable.
an in-house set of factorial solutions based on the foregoing
was prepared and the hanging drop method applied again to
the kiv-10/m66 and kiv-10/m66r72 samples. the conditions were eventually refined to produce x-ray quality single
crystals. the crystallization conditions of all the kiv-10
kringles are given in table 1.
intensity data collection. the x-ray diffraction data of
the kiv-10 crystals were measured with an r-axis ii
imaging plate detector using molecular structure corporations
yale focusing mirrors. the cu kr radiation was generated
with a rigaku ru200 rotating anode operating at 5 kw
power with a fine focus filament (0.3 mm × 3.0 mm).
intensity data were measured at -150 °c with crystals flash
frozen in a cryosolvent consisting of 20% peg 4000/8000,
20% glycerol, and 0.1 m buffer that was also used in the
crystallization (table 1). the crystal-detector distance was
10.0 cm, and the detector-swing angles were 0° for kiv10/m66 and kiv-10/m66r72, 8.0° for kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx ,
and 10.0° for kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx . autoindexing and processing of the diffraction data were carried out with the
rigaku r-axis software package (33), and the results are
summarized in table 2. three of the crystals are isomorphous; the c-axis of the kiv-10/m66r72 mutant, however,
shrank by about 7.0 å.
structure determination. the crystal structure of kiv10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  was determined by molecular replacement
using the coordinates of k4 of human plasminogen (pdb
code: 1pk4) as an initial model. all residues of k4 that
differed in sequence from kiv-10/t66 were replaced with

alanine. rotation/translation searches were conducted with
the program amore (34) in the resolution range 10.0-3.5
å. the rotation search provided one distinct solution with a
correlation coefficient of 0.30. the position of the molecule
was fixed by a translation function that increased the
correlation coefficient to 0.39 (r ) 48.5%). rigid body
optimization further increased the correlation coefficient to
0.64 (r ) 37.6%). additional positional refinement by
energy minimization in the 10.0-3.0 å range to relieve close
contacts of the model was carried out with the x-plor
program package (35), decreasing the r-value to 27.6%.
the crystal structure of kiv-10/t66 complexed with
 xxxd146xxx  was refined with the programs prolsq (36) and
profft (37). first, three cycles of overall b-factor refinement starting with b ) 18.0 å2 converged to an r-value at
32.9% (7.0-2.8 å). then three cycles of the individual
temperature factor refinement brought the r-value to 29.4%.
further refinement applying alternate tight-loose geometry
restraints decreased r to 28.3%. at this stage, 2fo - fc
electron and fo - fc difference density maps indicated most
of the correct side chains of kiv-10/t66 that were alanine
residues in the initial model and revealed  xxxd146xxx , which was
not included in calculations. further refinement was conducted including most of the actual residues of the kringle,
as well as  xxxd146xxx . solvent water molecules were added
periodically on the basis of examination of difference density
maps at 2.5 å and higher resolution.
since the crystals of kiv-10/m66 and kiv-10/m66/
 xxxd146xxx  are isomorphous with that of kiv-10/t66, the
structure determinations of these two were conducted using
isomorphous replacement methods. the refined coordinates
of the kiv-10/t66 variant, with t66 replaced by alanine,
were used as an initial model. rigid body optimization with
the x-plor program package in the 10.0-3.0 å range
decreased the r-value from 38.6% to 33.2% for unliganded
kiv-10/m66 and from 43.7% to 34.5% for kiv-10/m66/
 xxxd146xxx  (without the ligand in the calculations). additional

positional refinement improved the r-values to 25.1% and
28.1%, respectively. after three cycles of overall b-factor
refinement and three cycles of individual b refinement using
the program profft, r converged to 24.6% for kiv-10/
m66 and 26.4% for kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx . the 2fo - fc
electron and fo - fc difference density maps clearly showed
m66 in kiv/m66 and the  xxxd146xxx  in addition, in the kiv10/m66/ xxxd146xxx  structure.
the crystal structure of kiv-10/m66r72 had to be
determined de novo by the molecular replacement method
(because of the dramatic shrinkage of the c-axis, table 2)
using the coordinates of kiv-10 from the kiv-10/t66/
 xxxd146xxx  complex. residues t66 and r72 were replaced with
alanine, and  xxxd146xxx  was omitted from the model. the
rotation/translation search in the resolution range 10.0-3.0
å provided one distinct solution with a correlation coefficient
of 0.71 and a r-value of 32.6%, while further rigid body
refinement decreased the r-factor to 30.5%. final restrained
least-squares parameters and r-factor statistics for the kiv10 complexes are presented in table 3.
results
the electron density is well defined for most of the
residues of the kringle variants except the interkringle
peptides that are disordered here and in other kringle
structures. the rms deviations of the position of cr atoms
between the different kiv-10 units (about 70 cr positions)
indicate that the molecules exhibit very similar structural
folding (table 3). ramachandran plots of the kiv-10 variants

k5, and unbounded kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  (23, 26-30), the

as in other kringle structures, the p30 residue is in a cis
conformation.
the lbs of kiv-10 is also defined by r32-r35, d55d57, w62-f64, and  xxxd1097xxx -y74 (figure 1). hydrogen bonds
in the lbs region can be divided into three principal groups
according to several factors, which can depend on the binding
of  xxxd146xxx  or on intermolecular interactions of neighboring
molecules in crystals. the first group includes hydrogen
bonds that are common to all the structures (table 4). these
interactions in the lbs mainly involve atoms of the backbone
and are generally not completely exposed on the surface.
the second group consists of the hydrogen bonds that result
from the binding of  xxxd146xxx  (table 5). the residues of the
anionic and cationic binding centers and several water
molecules in the lbs participate in the hydrogen-bonding
interactions of this group. residue r32, which is located on
the surface of the lbs, gives rise to the third group of
hydrogen bonds in the lbs region that depend on crystal
packing (figure 2).
in the liganded structures of the m66 and t66 variants of
kiv-10, the electron density of the  xxxd146xxx  in the lbs is
similar and well defined (figure 2) and  xxxd146xxx  interacts in
the embedded way with all three binding centers in both
kringles (figures 1 - 3). the anionic (d55/ xxxd57xxx ) and cationic
(r35/ xxxd1097xxx ) centers stabilize the amino and carboxylic groups,
respectively, while the hydrophobic pocket (w62, f64, w72,
y74) interacts with the methylene chain of the ligand. thus,
the kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  structure determined here differs very
significantly from the unbounded kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  structure reported previously (29), which only showed ligand

mochalkin et al.
binding at the anionic center (figure 1). except for arg35,
the binding of  xxxd146xxx  to both the m66 and t66 variants
occurs with minimal structural reorganization so the lbs
appears to be essentially preformed anticipating ligand.
because of the decrease of the lysine binding affinity of
kiv-10/m66r72 compared to that of the t66 and m66
variants (16), its lbs is of special interest. substituting a
nonaromatic amino acid for w72, an obviously important
residue of the hydrophobic pocket along with w62 (figure
3), would in itself be expected to lead to some impairment
of binding affinity. the structure of kiv-10/m66r72 additionally shows that r72 extends across the lbs toward
the negatively charged d55/ xxxd57xxx  pair making a hydrogen
bonded salt bridge with  xxxd57xxx  (table 5) and thusly obstructs
access to the lbs. since the cationic center consisting of
r35 and  xxxd1097xxx  does not undergo any structural changes and
is positionally similar to that of the unliganded kiv-10
molecule (figures 1 and 3), the arginyl of r72 occupying
the binding groove of the lbs appears to be the structural
deterrent responsible for the lack of binding affinity of the
kiv-10 mutant.
all four kiv-10 variants crystallized in the orthorhombic
space group p212121. three of the crystals are isomorphous,
while the c-axis of the fourth, kiv-10/m66r72, is about 7.0
å shorter (table 2). this 10% shrinkage is the result of
different molecular packing of the kiv-10/m66r72 molecules along the c-axis of the crystal. superposition of the
mutant with any of the three isomorphous variants showed
very little rotation of the molecules with respect of each other,
with only a translational difference along the z-direction. in
all four crystal arrangements, kringle molecules form infinite
chain columns parallel to the y-direction with a 15 å wide
channel between chains. in kiv-10/m66r72, two neighboring symmetry-related molecules are aligned approximately
3.5 å closer along the crystallographic c-axis, while the
packing along the two other axes remains about the same.
the net result is to shrink the channel to about 7 å at the
expense of solvent water molecules. the solvent fraction of
the three isomorphous kiv-10 structures is approximately
30.6% (vm ) 1.76 å3/da). in the case of the w72r mutant,
the shrinkage along the c-axis decreases the solvent content
to 22.0% (vm ) 1.56 å3/da). the number of water molecules
found in the four different kringle structures varies from 41
to 109 and is generally related to the resolution of the
diffraction data, but in the case of kiv-10/m66r72, it
depends primarily on the solvent fraction of the crystals.
discussion
the overall topology of human kiv-10 is an oblate
ellipsoid of approximately 28 å in diameter and 18 å thick
(figure 1). the lbs of kiv-10 is similar to those of
plasminogen k1 and k4 (23, 26-28). all three key segments, the anionic, cationic, and hydrophobic centers, are
essentially positioned optimally for ligand binding in kiv10/m66 and, except for r35 (figure 1), remain so on ligand
binding in kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx  and kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx . in
kiv-10/m66, residue d55 is in the same orientation (chi1 ≈
60°) as in plasminogen k1 and k4. in plasminogen k5,
however, d55 extends into the solvent region in a different
orientation (chi1 ≈ 100°) apparently nonconducive to ligand
binding (30). it has been suggested that the d55 residue of

k5 reorients on ligand binding to form a doubly charged
anionic center along with  xxxd57xxx , which then interacts with
the amino group of the ligand as in kiv-10, k1, and k4.
thus, the lbs region of k5 possesses the anionic center,
but with i35 and l71, it lacks the cationic one. it would
therefore be expected that k5 can bind longer alkylamines
such as 5- and 6-aminopentane and -aminohexane, respectively, which it does (30).
all three binding centers are operative in kiv-10/m66/
 xxxd146xxx  and kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  examined in the present
work, and  xxxd146xxx  binds to the lbs in the embedded way
(figures 1 and 2). this binding mode, also observed in
plasminogen k1 and k4 (figure 1), is consistent with binding
constants of different ligands discussed earlier. thus, the
binding of embedded kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  is very different
from the unbounded mode previously reported for the kiv10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  structure (29). it is noteworthy, however, that
lysine binding kringles can bind ligand in two different ways.
the source of the binding mode variance between our
work and that of mikol et al. (29) most likely resides in the
different conditions used for crystallization. the major
differences are as follows: unbounded kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx ,

protein concentration 5 mg/ml, ph 7.5, in the presence of
40 mm nacl; present work kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx , 12 mg/ml,
ph 5.6, no nacl but with 10% 2- xxxd3026xxx  and a 10-fold
molar excess of  xxxd146xxx  [latter unreported by mikol et al.
(29)]. although the different ph conditions might seem
important, liganded k1 and k4 crystals in the embedded
mode were grown at higher ph values of 6.5 and 6.0,
respectively.4 it is of some note that, in the lbs of
unliganded plasminogen k1 crystals, there are two chloride
ions in the vicinity of the cationic center, which appear to
interact with and neutralize r35 and  xxxd1097xxx  electrostatically
(26). in the case of unliganded plasminogen k4, the anion
is a sulfate and the interaction is more complicated by the
additional presence of a symmetry-related molecule (27).
thus, it is conceivable that the unbound ligand binding mode
of kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  (29) could result because of an anioncompensated cationic center. however, examination of the
b-values of the water molecules in the lbs of the latter
reveals only evidence for water molecules of solvation (no
inordinately small b-values evidencing anions).
the unique features of the lbs of the apo(a) kiv-10 of
rhesus and chimpanzee are the point mutations that lead to
an impairment in  xxxd146xxx  binding and binding to lysinesepharose (13, 16, 19). the structure of the recombinant
mutant kiv-10/m66r72 shows that r72 extends along the
ligand binding groove parallel to the expected position of
 xxxd146xxx , toward the negatively charged d55/ xxxd57xxx  anionic
center, and makes a hydrogen-bonded salt bridge with  xxxd57xxx 
(figure 3, table 5). thus, the r72 side chain mimics ligand
binding, and loss of binding ability is the result of a steric
blockage of the lbs by r72 physically occupying part of
4 mikol et al. crystallized unliganded kiv-10/t66 and kiv-10/t66/
 xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx  in the unbounded binding mode) isomorphously (space
group p21) (29). using practically the same conditions, however, they
crystallized kiv-10/t66 liganded with p-(aminomethyl) xxxd306xxx 
in the embedded binding mode isomorphous (space group p212121) with
kiv-10/m66, kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx , and kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  of the
present work.

the site. the lbs structure of kiv-10/m66r72 is similar to
the lbs region of ptk1, which has an r72 equivalent but
lacks the  xxxd57xxx  to make a salt bridge. in this case, r72 appears
to form a salt bridge with d55. this structure was used
previously to model closely the lbs of rhesus kiv-10/
m66r72 (13). in turn, the d57n point mutation in the lbs
of kiv-10/n57 of chimpanzee simply lowers the negative
electrostatic charge of the anionic center that appears to be
so critical for the binding of the quaternary, positively
charged -amino group of lysine and other zwitterionic
ligands. this only leads to an electrostatic impairment of an
otherwise capable lbs. since the n57 side chain is geometrically nearly isostructural with the  xxxd57xxx  it replaces and
can be a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor, it would seem
that the lbs function of kiv-10 of chimpanzee should be
less impaired compared to that of the rhesus monkey,
primarily because the steric impairment of the latter excludes
ligand physically. this suggested difference in lbs function

between the kiv-10 of rhesus and chimpanzee could not be
assessed further because the lysine binding conditions were
not provided for the chimpanzee product (19).
superposition of the kiv-10/m66 and the ligand-bound
kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx  and kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  structures shows
that the binding of  xxxd146xxx  in kiv-10 is accompanied by (1)
a displacement of water molecules from the  xxxd146xxx  binding
groove and (2) a movement of the arginyl residue of r35
(figure 1). three water molecules (ow258, ow259, ow260)
extending from the anionic to the cationic center in kiv10/m66 are displaced by  xxxd146xxx  with ligand binding. two
other hydrogen-bonding water sites, located in the lbs
region but not in the  xxxd146xxx  binding groove, are conserved
in both structural types (table 5). similar to binding of
 xxxd146xxx , the w72r mutation causes the displacement of water
molecules from the binding groove. additional examination
of the residues within 5.0 å of the lbs indicates only a
conformational change in residue r35 on binding  xxxd146xxx .

apolipoprotein(a) kringles
in the ligand-free structures of kiv-10/m66 (figure 1) and
kiv-10/m66r72 (figure 3), residue r35 adopts an extended
conformation, almost parallel to the lbs groove, and utilizes
a hydrogen bond with p54o (table 4). upon ligand binding,
r35 of the m66 and t66 variants swings around the cacb bond by about -120° toward the cationic center but
remains extended, bringing the guanidinium group close to
the carboxylate of  xxxd146xxx  to assist  xxxd1097xxx  in stabilizing the
anionic end of the ligand (figures 1, 2, and 3, table 5) as in
plasminogen k4. the movement is accompanied by an
approximately 1.3 å shift of the tyrosyl ring of the side chain
of y41 into the vacancy created by the r35 conformational
change. when r35 is in the ligand binding posture, two water
molecules (ow261, ow244; table 5) also occupy the vacancy
created by the shift. the kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  also shows the
arginyl reorientation but the guanidinium amino groups
correspond to weaker electron density so their orientation is
not as certain as that of the m66 variant.
superposition of the kiv-10 variants also revealed different conformations for r32. this residue is located on the
surface of the kringle and is adjacent to the lbs of a
symmetry-related molecule and appears to play a role in
molecular packing. the conformation of r32 is similar in
the kiv-10/m66 and kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx  structures. in
addition to a favorable hydrogen-bonding interaction between
its carbonyl oxygen atom and r71nh1 in the free and ligandbound structures (table 4), the terminal guanidino nitrogen
atoms of r32 in kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx  participate in a
complicated electrostatic cluster comprised of the carboxyl
group of  xxxd146xxx  of the symmetry-related molecule and r35/
d55 of the corresponding cationic and anionic binding
centers. apparent charge neutralization is achieved by the
cluster through an pseudocyclic arrangement of positive and
negative centers [r32 of a neighboring kringle, d55,
quaternary amine of  xxxd146xxx , the carboxylate of  xxxd146xxx , and
arg35 (figure 2)]. in the kiv-10/t66/ xxxd146xxx  structure r32
has two alternate conformations, which have been refined
to an occupancy of 0.6 (extended) and 0.4 (bent). the r32
in the extended conformation interacts with a symmetryrelated kringle unit (figure 2), whereas in the bent conformation it forms a hydrogen bond with cis p30o (3.00 å) of
the same molecule. an additional water molecule participates
in the stabilization of both the extended and the bent
conformation. in the kiv-10/m66r72 mutant, r32 is in an
intermediate bent conformation displaying both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions while bridging two kringle
molecules. the nh1 and nh2 atoms interact with cis p30o
as in kiv-10/m66 and kiv-10/m66/ xxxd146xxx , but in addition,
there are close intermolecular contacts between r32ne and
d55od2 (3.16 å) as well as r32nh2 and r35nh2 (3.25
å) of the lbs of a symmetry-related molecule.
the current crystallographic studies of a wild-type (w72)
and mutant (r72) of human kiv-10 provide a detailed
account of the way apo(a) kiv-10 binds to lysine and its
analogues. this information is of biological relevance in that
lysine binding and related activities of lp(a) depend on the
function of lbs of kiv-10 (13, 14). the kringle, according
to current dogma, is considered to be exposed because it
has no apparent formal linkages with the lipoprotein component of lp(a). in keeping with this notion is the lysine
binding deficiency of rhesus monkey and the human mutant
lp(a) having the critical w72 replaced by r in the lbs of

biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 7, 1999 1997
kiv-10. from the standpoint of the athero-thrombogenic
potential of lp(a), this type of mutation has been suggested
to be benign on the premise that it would be unable to
interfere with the plasminogen to plasmin conversion (13,
14). this view has recently received support from studies
with transgenic mice (38). because of the pathobiological
significance of the lbs and its potential for mutability, it
would be of further interest to study additional natural and/
or artificial mutations in order to define their impact on the
lysine binding activity of apo(a) kiv-10. in the current study
we have shown that the replacement of m by t in position
66 had no significant structural consequences, in agreement
with the finding that this common human mutation is
functionally silent. the example provided by chimpanzee
lp(a) of a substitution at d55 by n is of interest in that we
predict that such a substitution would lead to only a relatively
modest degree of functional impairment of lysine binding
function compared to that of the rhesus. a functional
hierarchy in the lbs might account for the variability in
lysine binding activity among human subjects based on
measurements of whole plasma (14, 39). in this context,
however, we cannot rule out the contribution to the binding
by a second lbs contained in the region between apo(a)
kiv-5 and kiv-8 (40). this region is usually open in free
apo(a) whereas it is essentially masked when apo(a) is a
constituent of the lp(a) particle (40, 41). a structural
understanding of the region may be of some consequence
in view of its suggested involvement in the lysine-mediated
binding of apo(a) to fibrinogen (42).
