and photons of light.1 moreover, they are very important pharmaceutical drug targets and identiﬁcation of
a gpcr activation mechanism is the major requisite
of rational drug design.2,3 the largest and best-studied class a of gpcrs4 includes, among others, rhodopsin (rd) and the neurohypophyseal hormone
receptors, which are the subject of this work. the xray structure of the inactive (dark) form of bovine
rd5–8 is the only crystal structure of gpcr resolved
to atomic resolution. it is an agreement that rd
makes a good structural template for other class a
members.3,9–13 accordingly, it was used as a template
for building neurohypophyseal  xxxg1603xxx 
models in our previous investigations.14–16 the neurohypophyseal  xxxg1603xxx  subgroup includes
three vasopressin receptors ( xxxg229xxx ,  xxxg230xxx , and  xxxg231xxx )
and a unique  xxxg1642xxx  (otr).17–19 the main
function mediated via  xxxg231xxx  expressed in the collecting duct (cd) of the kidney is the regulation of water
reabsorption and concentration of the urine (antidiuretic effect).20 mutations in the  xxxg231xxx  gene are responsible for the x-linked form of nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus (ndi).21  xxxg229xxx  mainly controls increase of
blood pressure, whereas the stimulation of  xxxg1801xxx  hormone secretion is mediated via  xxxg230xxx 
(also known as v3r), which is not a subject of this
work.22,23 otr is involved mainly in the control of
labor and lactation in the mammals.24,25 moreover,
neurohypophyseal hormone receptors play a role in
many reproductive, behavioral, and social functions.26  xxxg229xxx ,  xxxg230xxx , and otr are functionally
coupled to the gq/11 protein that stimulates the activity of phospholipase c and cytosolic calcium mobilization, whereas  xxxg231xxx  is coupled to the gs protein that
stimulates adenylyl cyclase.17,18 the cellular
response resulting from receptor activation is mainly
determined via a type of a coupled g protein. the
molecular mechanism determining the selectivity of
receptor–g protein interaction is important for understanding the signal transduction pathway.
the neurohypophyseal hormone receptors, as typical gpcrs members, share a common membrane to-

pology, thus being membrane-embedded proteins
built of a single long polypeptide chain that traverses
the membrane seven times and forms the transmembrane domain consisting of seven -helices (tm)
successively connected with extracellular (el) and
intracellular (il) loops.5,9,11 receptor activation is
induced when diffusable extracellular agonist docks
to the receptor binding cavity and causes the switch
of the receptor protein from an inactive state to an
active conformation capable of interacting with a g
protein.27 the nonapeptide hormone  xxxd3495xxx  (cyfqncprg-nh2, avp), also termed the
 xxxd3495xxx  (adh), is an endogenous agonist of the vasopressin receptors. the second neurohypophyseal hormone oxytocin ([i3,l8]avp, ot)
binds to the vasopressin receptors with low afﬁnity,
however, it is a natural agonist of otr.28 avp is
released into the blood for interaction with respective
receptors under two main stimuli, i.e., the response to
low urine osmolality and changes in blood volume
and pressure.29 vasopressin also displays to a low
degree typical ot activities: uterine contraction and
milk ejection.28
desmopressin ([1-deamino, 8-d]avp,  xxxd1847xxx ),
the main subject of this investigation, is strong selective  xxxg231xxx  agonist with negligible pressor and uterotonic activity.30,31 it is widely used for treatment of
central diabetes insipidus and primary nocturnal enuresis.32,33  xxxd1847xxx  also increases levels of the  xxxg751xxx  in mild  xxxg751xxx  and  xxxg2423xxx  in von willebrand disease.34–36 in table i
the biological activities of the neurohypophyseal hormones and avp analogues:  xxxd160xxx  (1-deamino- xxxd3495xxx ),  xxxd160xxx  (8- xxxd862xxx  vasopressin),
and  xxxd1847xxx  are given. it is known that the deamination of the avp molecule results in almost four times
the enhanced afﬁnity toward  xxxg231xxx  (see table i), probably due to a change of the molecule conformation.37
the deamination does not change afﬁnity toward
 xxxg229xxx , while this receptor is very sensitive to substitution at position 8, and the presence of  xxxd862xxx  in this
position results in the very low pressor activity (see
biopolymers doi 10.1002/bip

desmopressin binding in vasopressin and oxytocin receptors

table i). thus, the high  xxxg231xxx / xxxg229xxx  selectivity of
 xxxd1847xxx  results from absence of some critical receptor–ligand interactions in  xxxg229xxx . consequently, it has
been established that single-residue asp103 located in
the ﬁrst extracellular loop (el1) of  xxxg231xxx  is responsible
for the high afﬁnity binding of the  xxxd1847xxx .38
to clarify molecular mechanism of receptor–ligand
interactions, experimental investigations are indispensable. however, they provide limited information
about the dynamics of the docking and activation
processes as well as about the role of environment
(lipid or water molecules). computer simulations
make it possible to investigate many aspects of binding and activation processes in detail and they interplay with experiments either conﬁrming experimental
results or providing a new hypothesis for experimental
veriﬁcation. unfortunately, available force ﬁelds are
not advanced enough to simulate the receptor activation via docking agonist and subsequent molecular
dynamics (md) simulation in timescales typical for
gpcr activation. the crystal structure of gpcr (rd)
also represents the inactive state of the receptor5–8 and
its activation mechanism is still poorly recognized.
however, it has been accepted that rd activation
involves an outward move of the tm6, tm7, and
tm2 cytosolic halves along with adjacent loop parts,
away from the 7tm bundle with the simultaneous
clockwise (viewing from the cytosol) tm6 rotation.39,40 these conformational rearrangements eventually result in conversion from rhodopsin to metarhodopsin (meta ii, mii). it is also known that the
c-terminal peptide gt(340–350) stabilizes mii.41–44
accordingly, an atomic-resolution model of the mii
monomer complexed with the gt(338–350) fragment
has been proposed;45 subsequently, it was used as
the template for construction of activated neurohypophyseal  xxxg1603xxx  models and the interacting
fragments of respective g proteins: gs(382–394);
(iiqrmhlrqyell) for  xxxg231xxx  and gq/11(347–359);
(tilqlnlkeynlv) for  xxxg229xxx  and otr.46 these
models were applied successfully in our former investigations concerning the interactions with ot and
avp.46,47 the same models are currently used in this
work for analysis of receptor– xxxd1847xxx  interactions.

methods
parametrization
nonstandard amino acid residues and other structure fragments were parameterized as recommended in the amber
7.0 manual.48 speciﬁcally, the point atom charges were ﬁtted by applying the resp procedure49 to the electrostatic
potential calculated in the 6-31g* basis set using the program gamess.50
biopolymers doi 10.1002/bip

models
the three-dimensional model of  xxxd1847xxx  was built using
the coordinates of pressinoic acid51 and the biopolymer
module of the sybyl package.52 the three-residue c-terminal tail of  xxxd1847xxx  was added in the amber 7.0 force ﬁeld.48
the lowest-energy conformation of  xxxd1847xxx  was obtained
using energy minimization followed by the simulated
annealing protocol in amber.53 nonetheless, regardless of
the ‘‘seed conformation’’ of the ligand, the autodock program,54 subsequently used for docking  xxxd1847xxx  to receptors, employs a modiﬁed genetic algorithm55 to explore the
conformational states of a ﬂexible ligand. hence, the extensive conformational changes do occur during docking and
any reasonable initial  xxxd1847xxx  structure is considered satisfactory at this point.54,56
the three-dimensional models of activated neurohypophyseal hormone receptors ( xxxg231xxx ,  xxxg229xxx , and otr) and the
 subunit c-terminal fragments of suitable g protein necessary to keep the receptor in an activated state were constructed as described previously,46 using the model of mii–
gt(338–350), which is the appropriate modiﬁcation of the
x-ray rd structure,5 as a template. brieﬂy, all computer
modiﬁcations necessary to obtain neurohypophyseal receptor
models were made using standard amber 7.0 tools48 and the
biopolymer module of sybyl52 as described previously.46

docking and md simulation
in the next step  xxxd1847xxx  was docked into the  xxxg231xxx –
gs(382–394),  xxxg229xxx – gq/11(347–359), and otr–gq/
11(347–359) systems, using a modiﬁed genetic algorithm
as implemented in autodock program.54 autodock is a
suite of programs designed to predict the bound conformation(s) of a ﬂexible ligand to a macromolecular target.54,56
details of the docking procedure were described elsewhere.14,56,57 the relaxation of the complexes using a constrained simulated annealing (csa) protocol in vacuo for
15 ps,53 followed by energy minimization, with positional
constrains on c atoms in 7tm to maintain the receptors
shape in homology to mii was done. the two lowestenergy systems per each v2–gs(382–394)– xxxd1847xxx , v1a–
gq/11(347–359)– xxxd1847xxx , and otr–gq/11(347–359)–
 xxxd1847xxx  complex were chosen. subsequently, six selected
complexes were inserted into the fully hydrated 1- xxxd2832xxx -2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(popc)
membrane model.58,59 no additional water molecules were
placed inside the receptor cavity. the models were submitted to the md simulation in the amber 7.0 force ﬁeld,48
using particle-mesh ewald electrostatic summation60 as already described.14 brieﬂy, the periodic box of each complex consisted of 120 popc lipid molecules, over 3,500
water molecules, and cl— counterions. moreover, for all
components of complexes, the opls61 united atom parameters were applied. the ﬂat-bottom soft harmonic-wall
restraints were imposed onto the ’, , and ! peptide angles
of the 7tm amino acid residues to avoid unfolding or any
other unwanted modiﬁcations of the helices. in accordance
with the standard amber protocol, the positional tm c

constraints were used exclusively for the ﬁrst 100 ps of the
simulation during heating the system from 0 to 300 k to
prevent the helices from degeneration. from 100 to 1,000 ps
free md simulation without positional constraints was carried out. finally, the energy minimization of the 1-ns md
snapshots in the amber 7.0 force ﬁeld48 was done.

analysis of interactions and
supplementary md
after md simulation six relaxed complexes were obtained.
for analysis of the receptor–ligand interactions, one lower
energy complex for each receptor was selected. it has been
experimentally demonstrated that the  xxxd103xxx  located in the
el1 of  xxxg231xxx  determines the high afﬁnity binding of the
 xxxd1847xxx .38 unfortunately, in both  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complexes
this interaction did not appear, neither during docking nor
during unconstrained md. thus, we attempted the supplementary manual docking of the  xxxd1847xxx  in  xxxg231xxx  using a
swiss–pdbviewer.62 the previously selected (that of lower
energy)  xxxd1847xxx – xxxg231xxx  complex was slightly modiﬁed via
displacement of ligand molecule toward the el1 to serve as
input for a new 1-ns md. therefore, the d-arg8 side chain
was situated proximal to el1  xxxd103xxx , while the cyclic part of
the molecule was retained docked in the depth the binding
cavity within the 7tm domain (see figure 1). subsequently, the complex was relaxed by the csa protocol followed by the energy minimization and submitted to the 1ns md simulation in hydrated membrane analogously as
described above and subsequently used for analysis of
 xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  interactions. actually,  xxxd1847xxx  was partially
‘‘undocked’’ by being pulled out toward the extracellular
side and slowly docked again during md, resulting in the
second  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complex. it is impossible to observe a
course of the docking in autodock, where the ligand is
instantly generated in the optimal location inside the binding cavity, thus the autodock-produced complexes represent the ﬁnal states of docking. the slow ligand docking
during 1-ns md might stand for model of the docking
course. therefore, the supplementary  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complex might represent one of early states of docking.
receptor amino acid residues involved in ligand binding
have been identiﬁed using distance criteria, i.e., all amino
acid residues in which any atom was not farther away than
3.5 å from any atom of the  xxxd1847xxx  residue, were chosen to
be interacting. subsequently all receptor residues not
involved in any interaction were omitted during visual
inspection. several distant residues interacting with the
ligand were added on condition that they were not farther
away than 4.5 å. the amino acid residues meeting these
criteria are listed in table ii. the most essential interactions
between  xxxd1847xxx  and respective receptors are characterized
by visual inspection and are presented in figure 2.

nomenclature
the  xxxd1847xxx  residues are identiﬁed using three-letter codes
with the indices in parentheses, e.g., d-arg8, while the re-

figure 1  xxxd1847xxx  docked to the  xxxg231xxx  cavity after manual docking, before md. the d-arg8 side chain is situated
proximal to el1  xxxd103xxx , while the cyclic part of the molecule remains docked in the depth the binding cavity within
the 7tm domain. the ﬁgure was prepared using the program rasmol.115

ceptor residues are identiﬁed using one-letter codes with
the universal class a indices (ballesteros–weinstein numbering scheme)63 placed as superscripts, followed by the
absolute numbers and e.g.,  xxxg231xxx  e1.3540. in the ballesteros–
weinstein scheme, the most conserved residue in the tm
helix ‘n’ has been given the number ‘n’50, and each residue is numbered according to its position relative to this
conserved residue. residues placed in loops are identiﬁed
with a one-letter code, followed only by the residue absolute number e.g., el2 v189.
moreover, in describing receptor–ligand interactions
involving the three-component names of complexes, e.g.,
‘‘ xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx –gs(382–394),’’ the clause ‘‘gs(382–
394)’’ is omitted for better legibility. telling about the receptor–g protein interaction, the name of the g protein segment e.g., ‘‘gs(382–394)’’ is abbreviated to ‘‘gs.’’ the g
protein residues are identiﬁed a using one-letter code following the name of g protein class e.g., gs l393.
two  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complexes are marked as i and ii
(autodock and manual docking, respectively).

results and discussion
conformation of receptors and  xxxd1847xxx 
and their changes during md
the binding pockets of the  xxxd1847xxx  in all receptors
are formed within tm1–tm7 with the ligand located
perpendicularly to the longer axis of the receptor (see
figure 2). all receptor– xxxd1847xxx  complexes remained
stable during 1-ns unconstrained md and there were
insigniﬁcant conformational changes of the receptor
structures. the rmsd measured on the all atoms/

a
the majority of residues conserved in the vasopressin/oxytocin family were previously experimentally determined as crucial for ligand
binding. among the non-conserved residues, for residues determined in  xxxg231xxx  subtype, the receptor name is given in parentheses.

7tm c atoms were 3.45 å/2.48 å for  xxxg231xxx (i), 1.62
å/1.26 å for  xxxg231xxx (ii), 2.64 å/1.79 å for  xxxg229xxx , and
2.91 å/2.88 å for otr. the lower rmsd for
 xxxg231xxx (ii) is not surprising and results from better
relaxation of the input receptor structure, which was
previously simulated for 1 ns as opposed to remaining
complexes (see analysis of interactions and supplementary md). moreover, strong receptor–ligand interactions (see below) contribute to the stability of
the complex. finally, there are very similar  xxxd1847xxx 
biopolymers doi 10.1002/bip

conformations in both  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) and  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  (ii) complexes with only the exception of
8
 xxxd862xxx  location as shown in figure 2. in general,
the location of  xxxd1847xxx  is nearly identical in all
complexes contrary to the dissimilar avp location
observed in the same receptors, as described in our
previous work.47 the location and conformation of
 xxxd1847xxx  change somewhat during md in all receptors, mostly in otr, and the rmsd measured on the
c atoms of  xxxd1847xxx  are: 1.15 å in  xxxg231xxx (i), 0.74 å in

 xxxg231xxx (ii), 1.45 å in v1r, and 2.48 å in otr. the
lower rmsd for ligand molecule in  xxxg231xxx (ii) results
from their better relaxation before docking. the low
rmsd values for both the ligand and the receptor
show stability of the whole complex. in all investi-

gated receptors the -turn is formed in the ligand
molecule and the stability for  xxxd1847xxx  conformation
is provided via one hydrogen bond between peptide
backbone, i.e., the carbonyl oxygen of mpa1 interacts
with the  xxxg641xxx  amide proton. furthermore, the c-terminal part of molecule, i.e., the important guanidinium group of d-arg8 is located within tm1– xxxg2318xxx .
however, in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  (ii) complex, the darg8 side chain projects outside the 7tm core,
whereas in  xxxg231xxx -dadvp(i) it is more embedded by
the binding cavity. in all complexes the n-terminal
part with the tyr2 and  xxxg641xxx  aromatic rings is situated
near  xxxg2318xxx –tm6, but in no complex do they interact
with each other, as a consequence of tyr2 with
respect to  xxxg641xxx  location on the opposite sides of the
macrocyclic ring plane in the  xxxg229xxx – xxxd1847xxx  and
otr– xxxd1847xxx  complexes. similarly, in both  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  complexes the  xxxg641xxx  side chain is situated
perpendicularly to the plane of the tocin ring, since
there is also no chance for stacking interaction with
tyr2. in figure 3 the superposition of  xxxd1847xxx  structures before and after md simulations is presented. in
the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) complex, three other intramolecular hydrogen bonds between side chains are formed
in the ligand molecule. therefore, the cys6 carbonyl
oxygen simultaneously interacts with the d-arg8 amide and asn5 carboxamide protons. moreover, the
pro7 carbonyl oxygen interacts with the d-arg8 guanidinium. as a result of forming the hydrogen bonds
involving side chains of asn5 and d-arg8, they are
slightly weaker when exposed to interactions with the
receptor residues, contrary to the fully accessible
gln4 and the c-terminal carboxamides. in the  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx (ii) complex, only one intramolecular hydrogen bond present in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) complex has
been retained, hence, the cys6 carbonyl oxygen still
interacts with the d-arg8 amide proton. as a result of
the lack of other hydrogen bonds involving the polar
side chains in  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx , they are fully accessible
for interactions with the receptor residues. in both
 xxxd1847xxx – xxxg231xxx  complexes, the aromatic side chain of
tyr2 is well exposed for interaction with the receptor,
whereas, in the  xxxd1847xxx – xxxg231xxx (ii) complex, the  xxxg641xxx 
aromatic ring, slightly dislocated over the macrocyclic ring, is less accessible for receptor residues. the
most signiﬁcant conformational change observed in
the  xxxd1847xxx – xxxg231xxx (i) complex during 1-ns md is the
dislocation of d-arg8 side chain and formation of
hydrogen bond with pro7 as described above (see figure 3a). the situation of the remaining side chains
has also changed, mainly that of gln4 and pro7. in the
 xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (ii) complex, the location of all side
chains changes only to a small extent (see figure
3b), however, mainly for gln4, as in the former combiopolymers doi 10.1002/bip

plex. in the  xxxg229xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complex, one more intramolecular hydrogen bond can be observed involving
the asn5 amide oxygen and the c-terminal carboxamide proton, thus the latter group is less accessible
for interaction with the receptor than the other side
chain groups. the asn5 side chain is folded back
beneath the ring moiety toward the disulﬁde bridge
and this is the most important change during 1-ns
md along with the displacement of the gln4 side
chain (see figure 3c). in the complex with otr, one
more hydrogen bond also can be formed, between the
 xxxg641xxx  carbonyl oxygen and the gln4 amide proton (see
figure 3d), resulting in a poor accessibility of this
group for otr residues. moreover, in this complex,
the location of all side chains changes noticeably during md in agreement with the highest rmsd for
 xxxd1847xxx  in otr.

inﬂuence of highly conserved residues interacting
with  xxxd1847xxx  on receptor activation. in figure 2a and
b and table ii, the most noticeable  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx 
interactions are given. the network of many hydrogen bonds involving the conserved amino acid residues (see multiple sequence alignment in figure 4)
can be observed in both  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) and  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx (ii) complexes. the interactions involving
the highly conserved 7tm gln residues (q2.5792,
q2.6196, q3.32119, and q6.55291) seem to be especially important for ligand binding. this is not surprising since they make a part of the binding cavity,
moreover, their side chain carboxamide could either
be a donor or an acceptor of hydrogen bonds formed
with the ligand. therefore, the gln carboxamides
could form the hydrogen bonds with the polar side
chains group of  xxxd1847xxx  as follows: q2.5792–asn5;
q2.6196–d-arg8, and q6.55291–tyr2, identically in
both  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complexes with the exception of
q3.32119 interacting with asn5 and gln4 in  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx (i) and  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (ii) complexes, respectively. the conserved 7tm gln residues have been
ﬁrst recognized as responsible for binding neurohypophyseal hormones and their analogs to rat  xxxg229xxx .64
moreover, their importance for ot and avp binding
in human neurohypophyseal hormone receptors has
been proposed.46,47 the detailed examination of
obtained receptor models, both inactive and active,
may explain their function. in the model of the inactive receptor, constructed on the template of rd crystal structure,5,16 the q2.5792, q2.6196, and q3.32119
carboxamides interact via hydrogen bonds with
another highly conserved residue s7.43315 (see figure
5a). this interaction is broken in the agonist-bound
model, as a result of interaction of these three gln
residues with  xxxd1847xxx  as described above (see table
ii and figure 2). moreover, s7.43315 also interacts
with the ligand via its hydroxyl forming the hydrogen
bond with the backbone carbonyl of asn5 or gln4 in
 xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) and  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (ii) complexes,
respectively. accordingly, s315r mutation in  xxxg231xxx 
has been identiﬁed as being responsible for ndi by
impairing avp binding.65 the docking of ligand may
directly break the interaction between three gln and
s7.43315 as an internal constraint between tm2,
 xxxg2318xxx , and tm7 and consequently result in their rearrangement, which is believed to be part of the activation process.12 there are several reasons that may
support this hypothesis. first of all, for the human 2
adrenergic receptor, it has been proposed that two
equivalent residues, y7.43316 and d3.32113, interact
with each other in the unoccupied receptor model and

within the subfamily, are shown in black while those with lower-level similarity are shown in
gray.25 the tm ‘n’50 residues are marked with an arrow.63

this interaction is absent in the agonist–receptor complex.66 second, it is also noticeable that s7.43315 is
equivalent to rd k7.43296 (see sequence alignment,
figure 4), where the k7.43296–e3.28113 salt bridge
maintains rd in the inactive state.67 in the vasopressin/ xxxg1642xxx  subfamily, the valyl (v3.28)
is conserved at this position and q2.5792, q2.6196,
and q3.32119 are the only residues in this region
that possess polar side chains long enough to form
the interhelical interaction (see sequence alignment,
figure 4).
two other highly conserved  xxxg231xxx  residues, r32
and e1.3540, located in the n-terminus and tm1,
respectively, might be involved in ligand recognition.
in both complexes their oppositely charged side chain
groups form a salt bridge with each other and interact
with the ligand simultaneously. in the  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx (i) complex, the c-terminal carboxamide of
 xxxd1847xxx  is headed toward r32 guanidinium in the nterminal sequence, whereas in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (ii)
complex it is located closer to the e1.3540 carboxyl.
indeed, the c-terminal carboxamide might interact
with both residues forming an ionic pair at the same
time. the equivalent arginyl (r46 and r34 in  xxxg229xxx 
and otr, respectively) has been identiﬁed as playing
a critical role in high-afﬁnity agonist binding.68,69 in
addition, e1.3546 has been recently determined to be
critical for avp binding in  xxxg229xxx .70 the molecular
basis for the signiﬁcance of these two residues has
not been deﬁned; however, it has been suggested that
it could be involved in the intramolecular interactions

with negatively charged residues.69,70 molecular
modeling in this study may help to explain this mechanism. in the inactive state of  xxxg231xxx , the r32 side
chain is exposed toward the extracellular side and
forms a salt bridge with the conserved el3 e303 (see
figure 5b). differently, in the agonist-bound model
( xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) complex), the r32 side chain is dislocated toward the binding cavity and interacts with
the e1.3540 carboxyl (see figure 5c). furthermore,
this ionic pair strongly interacts with the c-terminal
carboxamide of  xxxd1847xxx , as described above. accordingly, it has been demonstrated that the deletion of cterminal carboxamide results in avp analogs with
low agonist activity.71 it is conceivable that  xxxd1847xxx 
approaching from the extracellular side might interact
directly via c-terminal carboxamide with highly
exposed r32, resulting in dislocation of its side chain
toward the binding cavity along with the docking
ligand. this interaction would result in the disruption
of the r32–e303 salt bridge linking tm1 and tm7
and triggering the conformational changes leading
to receptor activation. interestingly, in the  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx (ii) complex the r32 interacts with these both
aspartates simultaneously (figure 5d). this might be
a model of the intermediate state, resulting from the
slower docking during md, contrary to instant docking in autodock (see analysis of interactions and
supplementary md).
the highly conserved w2.6499 interacts with the darg8; however, in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i) complex these
residues are situated perpendicularly to each other in

nists to the  xxxg231xxx .73 the remaining conserved residues
interacting with the  xxxd1847xxx  (see table ii) in our
models do not seem to be as important as the residues
described above. some of the hydrophobic residues,
especially those with bulky side chains, may play a
role in proper positioning of important receptor residues, such as two conserved valyl residues: v2.5388
and v3.28115. these two residues, in an inactive receptor, form the steric constraints delimiting the conformational space of crucial q2.5792 (partially also
q3.32119). therefore, they might force the appropriate gln position to form the interhelical interaction with s7.43315 as described above and shown in
figure 5a.

nonconserved residues are involved in the  xxxg231xxx –
selectivity. as described under methods, the
 xxxd1847xxx  molecule was ‘‘redocked’’ with manual help
to form the salt bridge between d-arg8 guanidinium
and el1  xxxd103xxx  (see figure 1). unexpectedly, after
1-ns md this interaction was discontinued. the analysis of the md trajectory revealed slow relocation of
w2.6499 indole between d-arg8 and  xxxd103xxx  until disruption of the previously formed salt bridge as shown
in figure 6. the exactly parallel arrangement of
indole w2.6499 and d-arg8 guanidinium in the ﬁnal
complex (see figure 5e) prevents any interaction of
the latter with el1  xxxd103xxx  carboxyl. nevertheless, it
does not necessarily contradict the experimental
results, in which the el1  xxxd103xxx  was identiﬁed as a
residue crucial for high afﬁnity  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  binding

being energetically favorable72 and might be directly
involved in the ligand dislocation toward the bottom

and proposed to interact with d-arg8.38 therefore, the
8
 xxxd862xxx  – xxxd103xxx  salt bridge might be formed at the recognition stage, before  xxxd1847xxx  entry into the  xxxg231xxx 
binding pocket. subsequently, the interaction would
slowly disappear during docking, thus making possible a correct, deep immersion of ligand inside the
binding cavity leading to full receptor activation.
other interactions are probably less important.
the interactions involving the nonconserved 7tm
residues and gln4 and tyr2 of the ligand can be
observed. in both complexes the s3.40127 hydroxyl
might form a hydrogen bond with the gln4 carboxamide, whereas f5.47214 might interact with the tyr2
and/or gln4 side chains. the interaction between the
c-terminal carboxamide and v7.36308 can be observed in both complexes. moreover, the second
extracellular loop strongly interacts with the c-terminal part of the ligand. thus, in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (i)
complex, the el2 t190 hydroxyl may form hydrogen
bonds with the c-terminal carboxamide, the gly9 amide proton, and the d-arg8 guanidinium simultaneously. similar interaction can be observed in the
 xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (ii) complex, where the el2 t190
hydroxyl may form a hydrogen bond with the c-terminal carboxamide of  xxxd1847xxx . the aromatic–hydrophobic interactions between m3.33120, v5.39206,
i5.42209 and aromatic rings of tyr2 and  xxxg641xxx  take
place; furthermore, m7.39311 interacts with the
 xxxd1847xxx  disulﬁde bridge. in any  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complex aromatic p–p receptor–ligand interactions have
not been observed, in agreement with the hypothesis
that they are involved in stabilization of an inactive
state of the receptor, as previously proposed.15,16,74
interaction with the gs(382–394) c-terminal peptide. to identify the  xxxg231xxx –gs(382–394) interactions, any receptor and gs residues within the mutual distance of 4.0 å or less have been selected and
subjected to detailed analysis. the receptor residues
identiﬁed as interacting with the gs segment are
shown in table iii and figure 7. in both  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx (i) and  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx (ii) complexes these
interactions are identical. this is not surprising, since
the location of gs(382–394) and its interaction with
 xxxg231xxx  remained unchanged during the renewed docking of  xxxd1847xxx  (see methods). subsequent 1-ns md
has not had any effect on their interactions.
the residues involved in the receptor–gs interaction are prevailingly hydrophobic; however, a few
signiﬁcant polar contacts occur. the important polar
interactions seem to be two salt bridges formed by
r3.50137 and d3.49136 from the highly conserved (d/
e)ry (in  xxxg231xxx  : drh) motif at the cytoplasmic end
of  xxxg2318xxx . in our model the d3.49136 carboxyl interacts

with the gs r389 guanidinium, while the r3.50137
guanidinium might interact with the gs l394 c-terminal carboxyl and/or gs e392 carboxyl. moreover,
the same gs e392 interacts with the carboxamides
of the highly conserved n7.45317 and n7.49321 via
hydrogen bonds as well as the another hydrogen bond
that may be formed between the y7.53325 hydroxyl
and the gs q390 carboxamide. r3.50137 has been
recognized to play a key role in triggering g protein
activation and mutation of this residue to histidine in
the human  xxxg231xxx  totally abolishes  xxxg231xxx –gs coupling,
resulting in a complete type of ndi.75 mutation of
the r3.50 in otr and several other receptors has
established an important role of this residue in g protein activation.76–79 accordingly, it has been suggested that the substitution of the adjacent acidic residue (glu or asp in d/ery motif) with noncharged
residue leads to constitutive activity.80–82 however, it
has been recently demonstrated that the arginyl of the
dry motif is not essential for g protein coupling for
a novel wild-type receptor, orf74-ehv2.83 hence,
although this motif is highly conserved, its function
in the gpcr activation and signaling might be speciﬁc for particular receptors.84 the n7.49321 and
y7.53325 are the part of highly conserved npxxy
motif at the cytoplasmic side of tm7; mutations of
n7.49 in different gpcrs have revealed that this residue is involved either in the adenylyl cyclase or in
the phospholipase c activation.85–87 moreover, the
analysis of the inactive  xxxg231xxx  model reveals that
n7.49321 participates in the network of the interhelical hydrogen bonds, involving the highly conserved
residues n1.5055, d2.5085, and s7.46318 (see figure
5f). interestingly, s7.46318 interacts simultaneously
with s7.43315, which is involved in the interhelical
interaction with three gln residues, as already
described (see figure 5a). therefore, it is possible
that the docking of agonist not only breaks the interaction between three gln and s7.43315, as proposed
previously, but initiates a gradual disruption of the
interhelical hydrogen bond network during receptor
activation, ﬁnally leading to the n7.49321 side chain
rearrangement toward the intracellular side for interaction with gs(382–394); as shown in the  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  complexes (figure 7). an activation mechanism involving n7.49 has been recently proposed for
 xxxg2341xxx .88
the remaining interactions at the receptor–
gs(382–394) interface are hydrophobic. the most
important handle point seems to be the highly conserved gs l393, interacting with as many as ﬁve
 xxxg231xxx  residues: i2.4378, l2.4681, m3.42129, i3.43130,
and m3.46133 (see figure 7). less important hydrophobic interactions can also be observed, involving

als: dry and npxxy motifs from receptor and two
highly conserved leucyls from the g protein. these
interactions have been formed at the step of activated
models building,46 while subsequent md simulation
with  xxxd1847xxx  applied in this study allows better ﬁtting
of the receptor–g protein interacting parts and
strengthening of the existing interactions. hence, it
is a reasonable validation of our recent hypothesis
concerning the interaction of class a gpcrs with g
proteins.45
the role of internal water molecules. internal
water molecules, contributing to the intricate network
of hydrogen bonds inside the receptor, involving the

mately 50 ps of md and remained at their target positions through the rest of the simulation (see figure 8).
in both  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complexes water molecules
interact mainly with the polar residues having wellexposed long side chains, which makes it favorable
binding site for an h-bond donor/acceptor. in figure 9,
several water-mediated interactions exemplifying
their structural function and a role in stabilization of
the receptor agonist-bound state are depicted. the
most important ones appear to be the interhelical
interactions that can be formed due to mediating
water molecules. therefore, as one may see in figure
9a, this particular interaction might have an inﬂuence
on the rearrangement of the adjacent parts of tm1,
tm2, and el2, where the interacting residues of the
receptor belong. this interaction may contribute to
forming the protuberance of el2 projecting toward
the extracellular side as observed in the activated
state (figure 2). some of the identiﬁed water molefigure 7 gs(382–394) docked inside the intracellular

desmopressin binding in vasopressin and oxytocin receptors

cules, located within the receptor–ligand contact surface, may mediate the receptor–ligand indirect interactions (e.g., see figure 9b and c). in figure 9b, one
may see an interaction of one water molecule with
two receptor residues and one ligand residue. this
interaction might have an inﬂuence on the correct
position of two highly conserved gln, q2.5792 and
q3.32119, which, apart from water-mediated interaction with cys6 backbone, could interact with the
ligand directly (see figure 2a and b). the largest
cluster consisting of ﬁve water molecules mediates
the interaction with as many as four receptor and one
ligand residues as shown in figure 9c. therefore,
three receptor domains,  xxxg2318xxx  (k2.29116), tm4
(q4.60174, q4.66180), and tm6 (q6.55291), are
involved in an interhelical water-mediated hydrogen
bond network. moreover, the tyr2 backbone also participates in these stabilizing interactions. it is noticeable that in our model highly conserved q4.60174 and
k2.29116 interact with the  xxxd1847xxx  only due to mediation of water molecules, but not directly. both of
these residues, along with q6.55291, are believed to
be crucial for ligand binding,64 whereas the nonconserved q4.66180 has been proposed as being responsible for selective binding to  xxxg231xxx .47 the network of
water molecules can be also observed within receptor–gs contact surface (figure 9d and e). these
interactions also contribute to the stabilization of the
whole complex. in figure 9d, one water molecule
mediating the interaction between gs e392 and two
receptor residues, n7.45317 and n7.49321, is shown. a
similar interaction is shown in figure 9e, where two
gs residues, r385 and l394, interact via one water
molecule with the highly conserved d3.49136. as can
be seen in figure 9e, at the receptor–g protein contact surface long water bridges also can be formed. it
is shown that the s333 from the c-terminus of  xxxg231xxx 
does not interact with the gs directly.
the structure and function of internal water molecules in gpcr is still little known contrary to their
well-deﬁned function in bacteriorhodopsin.93,94 yet,
water molecules identiﬁed in the vicinity of highly
conserved residues in the rd crystal structure have
been proposed to control the activity of rd and other
class a gpcrs.7 selected water-mediated interactions presented in this section demonstrate fairly well
their possible contribution to the stabilization of the
 xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx –gs complexes. the detailed examination of several different complexes of vasopressin
and oxytocin receptors, both in antagonist- and agonist-bound states, supporting the hypothesis about the
structural function of internal water molecules is in
progress and the results will be published in the future
(ślusarz et al., unpublished results).

 xxxg229xxx – xxxd1847xxx 

333

and otr– xxxd1847xxx  complexes

in both complexes, the residues equivalent to those in
 xxxg231xxx  also interact with the ligand. therefore, the
interactions with the highly conserved gln residues
occur, conﬁrming their possible role in the mechanism of  xxxd1847xxx  binding. the most important speciﬁc
interactions appear to be two analogous salt bridges,
involving the d-arg8 guanidinium and two carboxyls
of either conserved e1.35 (54 and 42 in  xxxg229xxx  and
otr, respectively) or nonconserved d2.65(112,100)
(see figure 2c and d). this interaction is obviously
absent in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complexes, where the
equivalent position occupies the positively charged
k2.65100. accordingly, it has been demonstrated that
the presence of k2.65100 in  xxxg231xxx  is adverse for
 xxxd1847xxx  binding in the human  xxxg231xxx , whereas
the presence of aspartate at this position assists the
binding of the  xxxd1847xxx .95 however, it has not
afﬁrmed whether the latter interact directly or indirectly with an agonist.95 similarly, as in the  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  complexes, the dislocation of the highly conserved arginyl (46 and 34 in  xxxg229xxx  and otr, respectively) occurs, thus supporting our hypothesis that it
might be involved in the receptor activation as
described above. similarly, as in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx 
complexes, any strong aromatic p–p interactions
between receptor and ligand do not appear, except an
insigniﬁcant interaction f6.51307– xxxg641xxx  in the  xxxg229xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  complex; only several hydrophobic or aromatic–hydrophobic interactions can be observed.
the  xxxg229xxx  and otr residues identiﬁed as interacting with the gq/11(347–359) c-terminal segment
are given in table iii. in general, the location of gq/
11 c-termini in both  xxxg229xxx – xxxd1847xxx  and otr–
 xxxd1847xxx  complexes has not been retained during md.
in the ﬁnal complexes, both gq/11 peptides are partially displaced from the  xxxg229xxx  and otr cavities toward the  xxxg1169xxx  and intracellular side. this is probably a
result of lack of some crucial stabilizing interactions
at the receptor–gq/11(347–359) interface. the important interactions with two highly conserved motifs
dry/c (in  xxxg229xxx  and otr, respectively) and npxxy
occur, however they are not as strong as in the  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  complexes. similarly, the highly conserved
gq/11 l353 and l35842 only weakly interact with
the receptor. the interactions with  xxxg1169xxx  k(82,70) as
well as r6.32(288,272) appear in the  xxxg229xxx  and otr,
which have not been observed in  xxxg231xxx  (see table iii).
it is conceivable that all of the interactions observed
in the  xxxg229xxx – xxxd1847xxx  and otr– xxxd1847xxx  complexes
have been formed during the simulations (docking,
csa, energy minimization, and md) and result simply from the ligand optimal ﬁtting inside the binding

cavity, past the recognition step that actually implicates the binding of  xxxd1847xxx  to  xxxg229xxx  and otr with a
small afﬁnity. this consequently results in inappropriate arrangement of other receptor residues and
makes impossible their high afﬁnity interaction with
the g protein, allowing its partial dislocation from
the receptor cavities.
eventually, as in the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complexes, the
internal water molecules in the ligand and gq/
11(347–359) vicinity can be observed in  xxxg229xxx  and
otr. they are accumulated within the receptor–
ligand contact surfaces, interacting with polar, longchain residues and in general are similar to  xxxg231xxx –
 xxxd1847xxx  complexes, contributing to the stabilization
of the receptor–ligand–g protein complexes.

comparison of modeling results to
available experimental data
in the absence of experimentally determined 3d
structures for vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, receptor models used in this study were constructed on
the template of activated rd complexed with gt cterminal peptide.45,46,96 although it is agreed that rd
makes a good structural template for other family a
members,3,9–13 using activated rd as a template for
modeling other gpcr activated states is problematic
and requires a validation for any speciﬁc case. initially, the predicted receptor models were reﬁned
computationally by energy minimization followed by
csa to reduce the steric clashes.46 however, the
obtained models may be validated based on available
experimental data for vasopressin/ xxxg1642xxx 
subfamily. therefore, md simulation (which efﬁciently samples conformational space) of agonistbound receptor models was conducted and 12 complexes with endogenous hormones, vasopressin and
oxytocin (six complexes per each ligand), were investigated.46,47 the majority of receptor amino acid residues proposed as interacting with the ligands were
previously identiﬁed as important for binding in experimental studies [46,47 and references therein]; the
remaining receptor–ligand contacts provide guidelines for future experimental site-directed mutagenesis. since, these two earlier studies46,47 provided a
partial reﬁnement of the receptor structures, the same
receptor models were consequently used to study the
receptor– xxxd1847xxx  interactions. in this investigation,
the receptor–ligand complexes were generated by
autodock.54 exclusively, in one  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  complex a d-arg8– xxxd103xxx  salt bridge was manually formed
based on experimental evidence on the  xxxd103xxx  relevance for  xxxd1847xxx  binding.38 all remaining receptor–
ligand interactions were formed during the simulation

(docking, csa, and energy minimization) and reﬁned
during 1-ns unconstrained md. comparing our modeling results with the available site-directed mutagenesis data for vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, the
ligand-binding properties of several mutants are
found to be in good agreement with the receptor–
ligand complexes obtained in this study. these experimental data provide very useful information to validate our receptor models64,68–70,73,92,95,97–105 (references assigned to speciﬁc residues are shown in table
ii). as one may see in table ii, a majority of receptor–ligand contacts that occur in complexes obtained
in this study were previously found to be involved in
ligand binding for vasopressin/ xxxg1642xxx  subfamily. for instance, a sigﬁcant reduction in avp
afﬁnity toward rat  xxxg229xxx , reported for the q2.57a,
q2.61a, q3.32a, and q6.55a mutants,64 can be explained by their polar, direct interactions with the
ligand observed in our models (see figure 2, table ii,
and above text). q4.60a mutant showed considerable
impairment of avp binding toward rat  xxxg229xxx .64 in
 xxxg229xxx  and otr, q4.60 directly interacts with the
 xxxd1847xxx , whereas in  xxxg231xxx  there is the water-mediated
interaction (see above text and figures 2 and 9). the
intricate network of hydrogen bonds is formed within
the k3.29116, q4.60174, q4.66180, q6.55291, tyr2 of
 xxxd1847xxx  and water molecules (see figure 9c), hence
the disruption of this dense network of interaction
may result in critical rearrangement of binding cavity
and loss of ligand high-afﬁnity binding. q2.61 is found
to be in strong, polar interaction with the  xxxd1847xxx  darg8 side chain. both q2.61a and q4.60a mutants
demonstrated a substantial reduction in afﬁnity to
avp,64 thus suggesting that they are especially important determinants of avp binding. accordingly,
in our model, q2.61 and q4.60 are located one helical
turn closer to the extracellular side than q2.57, q3.32,
and q6.55 (suggested as less important for avp binding64); therefore, these two residues may be in addition involved in ligand recognition among vasopressin and oxytocin receptors. the moderate changes in
avp– xxxg229xxx  afﬁnity64 resulting from q2.57a, q3.32a,
and q6.55a mutations are also in agreement with our
results. these residues, located somewhat deeper
inside the binding cavity, form the hydrogen bonds
with crucial  xxxd1847xxx  residues: tyr2 and asn5/gln4
(see table ii, figure 2, and text above). in general,
in the obtained models, all highly conserved gln
residues interact with the following ligand residues:
tyr2, d-arg8, asn5/gln4. it is noticeable that residues at these amino acid positions are commonly
known as especially important for agonistic activity among vasopressin/ xxxg1642xxx  subfamily.17,106–111

desmopressin binding in vasopressin and oxytocin receptors

two other highly conserved residues, which have
been previously proposed as critical for agonist binding toward vasopressin and oxytocin receptors are
also involved in  xxxd1847xxx  binding in our models.
accordingly, it has been found in site-directed mutagenesis that the mutation of highly conserved n-terminal r (32, 46, and 34 in  xxxg231xxx ,  xxxg229xxx , and otr,
respectively) results in strong impairment of ligand
binding.68,69 this is in agreement with our models,
where this conserved arginyl forms a hydrogen bond
with the c-terminal carboxamide of  xxxd1847xxx  as
described above (see also figure 2). more recently it
has been demonstrated that the highly conserved
e1.35 also plays an analogous role70 and, in agreement
with this ﬁnding, in our model this residue interacts
via hydrogen bond with the c-terminal carboxamide
(see figure 2 and above text).
detailed experimental data for human  xxxg231xxx  also
support validation of our receptor models, e.g.,
human  xxxg231xxx  mutations involving the following residues: l1.3944, v2.5388, w2.6499, el2 r181, i5.42209,
a6.58294, and s7.43315 have been previously found
as responsible for ndi by impairing avp binding65,73,92,97,98,105 and, accordingly all of these residues directly interact with  xxxd1847xxx  in our models (see
table ii). two other  xxxg231xxx  residues identiﬁed in our
study as interacing with  xxxd1847xxx  (m3.36123, s3.40127)
also have been recognized as being responsible for
ndi, but it is still undetermined whether they affect
ligand binding.112,113
the obtained receptor–ligand models provide the
information on receptor–ligand interactions at the
molecular level that are sufﬁcient to be validated by
available experimental data. moreover, the obtained
models also generate hypotheses regarding the molecular details of gpcr function, i.e., receptor activation, g protein coupling, or internal water molecules
role. these hypotheses might be next tested by
experiments whose results, in turn, would be used to
modify and reﬁne molecular models.

binding for the neurohypophyseal hormone receptors
subfamilies. the highly conserved residues have been
proposed in this study as contributing to the network
of interhelical interactions that, if broken, might initiate the conformational rearrangements during activation.
the nonconserved el1  xxxd103xxx  recognized as crucial for  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  high afﬁnity binding38 has been
proposed to be involved only in the ligand recognition. the receptor drh/y/c (in  xxxg231xxx ,  xxxg229xxx , and
otr, respectively) and npxxy motifs, being the
hallmarks for the family a gpcrs, have been identiﬁed to be involved in the g protein coupling. two
highly conserved leu residues at the c-terminus of
gs protein appear to be mainly responsible for receptor binding. eventually, the internal water molecules forming an intricate network of the hydrogen
bonds inside the receptor cavity have been detected.
these molecules appear to be involved in both
 xxxd1847xxx  binding and in gs coupling, contributing
signiﬁcantly to the stability of the whole system.
in summary, molecular models of receptor–ligand
interactions might signiﬁcantly facilitate rational
design of new avp analogs useful in several pathological conditions related to vasopressin  xxxg231xxx .
on the other hand, detailed knowledge on the  xxxg231xxx 
activation mechanism might assist in design of new
ligands capable of activating the mutated  xxxg231xxx  in
ndi. moreover, given the structural homology
among class a, these results might ﬁnd an application in the design of drugs acting via other class a
gpcrs.

conclusion
the docking of  xxxd1847xxx  to neurohypophyseal hormone receptors and subsequent 1-ns md simulation
of complexes allowed us to propose a model of receptor– xxxd1847xxx  interactions, involving both highly conserved and nonconserved receptor residues. a large
part of the  xxxg231xxx – xxxd1847xxx  interactions and those previously proposed for ot46 and avp47 is common.
moreover, the majority of residues identiﬁed in this
study have been previously determined in several experimental investigations to be involved in ligand
