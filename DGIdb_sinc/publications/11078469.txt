glielazide modified release: from once-daily administration
to 2 4 - h o u r b l o o d g l u c o s e c o n t r o l
andrew harrower

although sulfonylureas have been used for more than 40 years, it is only recently that their molecular mechanisms of action
have been elucidated.  xxxd2202xxx  modified release, whose introduction comes soon after the sequencing and cloning of the
sulfonylurea receptor, is the first sulfonylurea for which it is possible to detail its action from the moment of oral administration
through to its effects on long-term glycemic control. piecing together these steps for this new agent underlines the rationality
of its development and the important differences from other members of the sulfonylurea class. employing an innovative
pharmaceutical form based on a hydrophilic matrix to deliver this short-acting sulfonylurea,  xxxd2202xxx  modified release is
associated with an unsurpassed efficacy:acceptability ratio, with the potential additional advantages inherent in reduced
dosage and once-daily administration.

oday's clinicians are encouraged to practice evidence-based medicine, but many day-to-day decisions
remain empirical as knowledge of many domains is incomplete.
it is often forgotten that the recognition of the glucose-lowering
potential of sulfonamide-related compounds was a fortuitous
discovery. 1 the choice of an oral antidiabetic agent may be
influenced by a large number of factors, but often comes down
as much to personal preference or experience as to detailed
knowledge of the differential actions of each molecule. although now prescribed by 3 generations of diabetologists, it is
only very recent molecular biologic work, culminating in the
sequencing and cloning of the sulfonylurea receptors, 2 that has
substantially advanced understanding of the mechanisms of
action of the sulfonylureas, including important differences in
action between members of the class, which correlate well with
previous clinical experience.  xxxd2202xxx  is among the most
extensively investigated sulfonylureas. the large body of
research available with this sulfonylurea, and the welcome
recent introduction of the new once-daily modified-release
preparation, conspire to make this the first sulfonylurea for
which it is possible to detail its action step-by-step from
administrationto elimination.this article describes the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical effects of  xxxd2202xxx 
modified release, piecing together observations with the old and
new formulations. the heterogeneity of the sulfonylurea class is
underlined and differences that may influence their clinical use
are identified.

pharmacokinetics

 xxxd2202xxx  modified release is the first oral antidiabetic agent
to employ a hydrophilic matrix. this allows once-daily administration with 24-hour efficacy through progressive delivery of
short-acting  xxxd2202xxx . each tablet is constituted of a matrix of
hydrophilic hypromellose fibers, trapping granules composed of
 xxxd2202xxx , calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, and maltodextrin. once in contact with gastrointestinal fluid, the hypromellose polymer expands to form a gel, through which active
ingredient is progressively released. these characteristics are
highly reproducible, with predictable consistent release of
active ingredient over 24 hours, allowing once-daily administration (unpublished data: moliner r november 1998; thomas
rh, november 1998; wemer j, november 1998). pharmacokinetics are virtually unaffected by ph, thus the agent can be
given before, during, or after breakfast (unpublished data,
metabolism, vo149, no 10, suppl 2 (october), 2000: pp 7-11

moliner r november 1998). the modified-release preparation
demonstrates very nigh bioavailability (unpublished data, thomas rh, november 1998), which has allowed reduction in the
clinically effective  xxxd2202xxx  dose to 30 to 120 mg/d. in
steady-state, morning administration is followed by a progressive increase in plasma  xxxd2202xxx  concentration during the first
6 hours, followed by a plateau, and a progressive reduction over
18 hours (unpublished data, wemer j, november 1998). as a
result,  xxxd2202xxx  levels are therapeutic throughout the 24 hours,
but nonetheless relatively reduced during the (fasting) nighttime
period. the circadian variations of glycemia in type 2 diabetes 3
support the rational basis for this pharmacokinetic profile.
receptor dynamics

like other sulfonylureas,  xxxd2202xxx  is extensively proteinbound (87% to 94%) in the circulation, 4,5 which may account
for the minimal hepatic first-pass effect. in the pancreas,
 xxxd2202xxx  binds b-cell sulfonylurea receptors (with its sulfonylurea moiety) with high affinity,6 which is reflected in the
effective daily dosing of  xxxd2202xxx , in the milligram range,
compared with the gram level requirements of lower-affinity
agents such as  xxxd3394xxx . as well as having high affinity,
 xxxd2202xxx 's [3-cell interaction is rapidly reversible, as studied in
cloned receptor models by gribble and ashcroft, 6 and in the
isolated perfused pancreas. 7 in the latter, insulin release falls to
baseline on  xxxd2202xxx  withdrawal, while with  xxxd2215xxx 
there is persisting significant insulin secretion (fig 1).  xxxd2215xxx  and also, for example,  xxxd2203xxx  are thought to have
more complex binding to sulfonylurea receptor type 1 ( xxxg19xxx )
with both their sulfonylurea and benzamido groups, s the low
probability of spontaneous unbinding of the 2 sites (in conjunction with incorporation into the [3 cell in the case of  xxxd2215xxx ) is likely to explain the poor reversibility of interaction of
these agents, and their long duration of effect. potential clinical
implications of poorly reversible binding have been evoked in
the literature; "avid" fixation to the pancreatic receptors is pro-

potassium (kawp) channel downregulation has been observed
during chronic exposure of the pancreas to this long-acting
agent. ~0

one of the earliest demonstrable abnormalities during the
development of type 2 diabetes is the loss of the first peak of
insulin secretion. 1~,~4 indeed, genetically determined insulin
secretion abnormalities, including reduced first-phase responses, predate altered insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes
pathogenesis. 13 this first-phase secretion normally limits the
prandial rise in glycemia and primes insulin target tissues. the
inverse relationship between early insulin secretion and 2-hour
plasma glucose values after oral glucose tolerance testing
stresses that the early peak is important in determining later
plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.~5 data from epidemiologic and intervention studies link postprandial hyperglycemia more closely to cardiovascular risk than fasting glucose
levels. in the diabetes epidemiology: collaborative analysis of
diagnostic criteria in europe (decode) study, 16for example,
coronary heart disease mortality was correlated with 2-hour
postprandial glucose, but not fasting glucose levels, reflecting a
similar pattern seen in the earlier diabetes intervention study. 17
thus, restoration of the physiologic dynamic of secretion has
significant potential benefits for patients, and has recently been
re-emphasized as a priority in the design of an efficient
treatment for type 2 diabetes. ~a both in experimental models
and in type 2 diabetic patients,  xxxd2202xxx  has been shown to
restore a biphasic profile of insulin secretion as opposed to the
late monophasic response to  xxxd2215xxx .7,12it is possible that
the incorporation of  xxxd2215xxx  into the [3 cells, 19 as well as
its poorly reversible receptor binding,u and active metabolites, 2° contribute to this difference. important aspects of
 xxxd2202xxx 's efficacy and acceptability profile, notably its weightneutrality21-24and low hypoglycemia risk, 21,2s-27can be associated with restoration of a physiologic insulin secretory response. clinical support for absence of hyperinsulinismbetween
meals with  xxxd2202xxx  modified release comes from phase iii

hyperglycemia

synergy with glucose

sulfonylureas promote insulin secretion by favoring the
closure of kate channels. hyperglycemia acts similarly by
increasing the  xxxd83xxx : xxxd80xxx 
(atp:adp) ratio through oxidative glucose metabolism. this
results in opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels,
leading to insulin release from stocked vesicles, u insulin
secretion is therefore promoted synergistically by high glucose
levels and sulfonylurea sensitization of the pancreas (fig 2).
this mechanism is well demonstrated in the isolated perfused
pancreas, where ambient glucose concentrations strongly influence the amount, but not the kinetics, of sulfonylureastimulated insulin secretion, with insulin release decreasing
rapidly when glucose levels are reduced despite maintained
sulfonylurea concentrations, v the synergy with glucose was
more marked with  xxxd2202xxx  than with  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd3394xxx , or  xxxd2205xxx , and was hypothesized by the authors to act
as a self-regulatory mechanism limiting the risk of hypoglycemic events. data from hosker et al ~2 confirm the relevance of
these results for type 2 diabetic patients, with insulin responses
to  xxxd2202xxx  being more marked at higher glycemic clamp
levels.

study data, where no increase in fasting insulin was observed
after 10 months of treatment of a heterogeneous population of
401 type 2 diabetic patients despite a sustained effect in
reducing plasma glucose (fig 3).21 this confirms previous data
demonstrating significant improvement in postprandial insulin
levels without fasting hyperinsulinemia in type 2 diabetic
patients treated with  xxxd2202xxx . 2s
contribution of insulin sensitization

extrapancreatic effects of  xxxd2202xxx  on tissue insulin sensitivity have been extensively investigated using a variety of
methodologies including clamp techniques, isotope dilution,
and tissue biopsy. in type 2 diabetic patients, under insulinstimulated conditions,  xxxd2202xxx  treatment is associated with
increases in the activity of glycogen synthase in skeletal muscle,
with concomitant improvement in insulin-mediated glucose
disposal. 29 these effects are apparently independent of any
reduction in glucotoxicity, and mediated by a postreceptor
mechanism, as glycogen synthase activity increases despite
unchanged  xxxg1194xxx  kinase activity. stabilization of the
transporter glut1 in the plasma membrane by  xxxd2202xxx  has
been described and may contribute to this effect. 3°  xxxd2202xxx 
also suppresses hepatic glucose production during hyperglycemia, an effect thought to be independent of increased portal
insulinemia.29 thus, there would appear to be direct effects of
 xxxd2202xxx  on insulin sensitivity at both hepatic and skeletal
muscle levels that may play a role in the control of both fasting
and postprandial glycemia in long-term treatment.

achieving 24-hour control
the modified-release preparation delivers short-acting  xxxd2202xxx  progressively over 24 hours. it is thus of fundamental
importance for this new agent to demonstrate efficacy around
the clock. a specific study has been performed for this purpose,
which will form the subject of a separate publication. the
preliminary data available already allow the conclusion that the
glucose-lowering effect of  xxxd2202xxx  modified release is efficient over 24 hours following breakfast-time administration
(unpublished data, greb wh, november 1999). at the same
time, larger-scale clinical experience with the new product
demonstrates that this control is achieved without an excess of
hypoglycemia,2~ notably without any nocturnal episodes. the
pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2202xxx  modified release offers an
attractive explanation for these data, which stress the successful
marriage of the new delivery system with the well-tried and
-tested  xxxd2202xxx  molecule.
maintenance of control long-term

the phase iii development program of  xxxd2202xxx  modified
release included a population of 1,462 type 2 diabetic patients21
(also unpublished data, harrower adb, february 1999). deliberately minimalist exclusion criteria were applied, leading to
inclusion of a study population quite representative of the
heterogeneity seen in type 2 diabetes. results of a preceding
prospective, randomized, multicenter dose-ranging study (unpublished data, unger r november 1997) led to the selection of
30 mg as the standard starting dose of  xxxd2202xxx  modified
release, with the possibility of upward titration to 60, 90, or 120
mg as necessary. the largest phase hi study randomized 401
type 2 diabetics to the new agent once daily for 10 months. 21a
2-week washout period was undertaken; up-titration was allowed at monthly intervals depending on fasting plasma glucose
values. despite previous treatment with up to 2 oral agents, and
a washout period of only 2 weeks, the overall population
showed a net improvement in control, maintained at the end of
the study, on monotherapy with  xxxd2202xxx  modified release
given once daily. this was the case for glycated hemoglobin
(ahbalc, -0.22%), fasting plasma glucose (afpg, -0.83
mmol/l), and postprandial plasma glucose (appg, -1.18
mmol/l). one in 5 of the included patients was recently
diagnosed (previously diet-treated), thus allowing a more
realistic evaluation of the efficacy of the new agent in monotherapy. at the end of the study, these patients maintained a
mean improvement in hbalc of 0.91%, and had acceptable
metabolic control (hbalc, 7.38%, full analysis set). a key
finding of this study was that  xxxd2202xxx  modified release was at
least as effective as the existing  xxxd2202xxx  formulation in terms
of metabolic control over 10 months, whilst associated with
excellent tolerance, and particularly a low incidence of hypoglycemia, in all the subpopulations of type 2 diabetic patients.
the results of phase iii studies with the new agent are thus
entirely consistent with results previously obtained with  xxxd2202xxx . these have included trials of long-term efficacy, and
several efficacy comparisons with other agents. maintenance of
control to normal glycated hemoglobin levels was seen during a

10

andrew harrower

prospective 5-year study of  xxxd2202xxx  therapy. 22 a third of the
patients selected were newly diagnosed, the remainder previously treated. the latter had inadequate response to previous
treatment, which was stopped, and dietary management alone
followed for 2 months. after this run-in period, inadequately
controlled patients were prescribed  xxxd2202xxx  and included in
the 5-year follow-up. significantly improved control compared
with baseline was maintained at 3, 4, and 5 years of follow-up,
as reflected in the mean  xxxg1024xxx  of 7.3% at 5 years.

comparison with other sulfonylureas

available interagent efficacy comparisons include a randomized 1-year study in 112 type 2 diabetic patients allocated to a
standard escalating-dose regimen of  xxxd2202xxx ,  xxxd1678xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx ,  xxxd2205xxx , or  xxxd2215xxx .31 glycemic
control on  xxxd2202xxx  was significantly better than on  xxxd2205xxx 
or  xxxd1678xxx  in this study, and normalization of glycated
hemoglobin was achieved in 80% of  xxxd2202xxx -treated patients
versus 74%, 40%, 40%, and 14% for  xxxd2215xxx ,  xxxd2204xxx ,
 xxxd2205xxx , and  xxxd1678xxx , respectively. furthermore, a
secondary failure rate of only 7% on  xxxd2202xxx  therapy, as
compared with 17.9% on  xxxd2215xxx  and 25.6% on  xxxd2204xxx 
(p < .05), was observed over 5 years of follow-up (fig 4). 32
these effécacy results correlate well with the differential
actions of the sulfonylureas on 13 cells.  xxxd2202xxx 's rapidly

oliclazide is extensively metabolized, mainly in the liver, and
principally by hydroxylation. 33at least 7 metabolites have been
identified, with no circulating active metabolite. the major
route of elimination of  xxxd2202xxx  and its metabolites is via the
urine. 34 studies with radiolabeled  xxxd2202xxx  indicate 60% to
70% urinary excretion and 10% to 20% fecal excretion. in the
urine, hydroxymethyl and carboxymethyl, hydroxyl and 2-0glucoronide conjugates are found, with only trace quantities of
unchanged  xxxd2202xxx . elimination parameters are not significantly affected in the elderly,35 nor in patients with mild-tomoderate renal insufficiency, suggesting that dose adjustments
are unnecessary for such patients. 36 strong support for this
suggestion comes from clinical studies showing a very low
incidence of hypoglycemia in elderly patients and those with
mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency receivi~ag full doses of
 xxxd2202xxx  modified release, comparable with that observed in
the general study populations of heterogeneous type 2 diabetic
patients despite similar glycemic controf 1 (unpublished data,
