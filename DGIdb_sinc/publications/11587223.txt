although cyst(e)ine is nutritionally a non-essential amino acid,
lymphoid cells cannot synthesize it, rendering their growth
dependent on uptake of cyst(e)ine from their microenvironment. accordingly, we previously suggested that the
x⫺
c plasma membrane cystine transporter provided a target for
lymphoid cancer therapy. its inhibition could lead to cyst(e)ine
deficiency in lymphoma cells via reduction of both their cystine
uptake and cysteine supply by somatic cells. in this study,
using rat nb2 lymphoma cultures, drugs were screened for
growth arrest based on x⫺
c inhibition.  xxxd3255xxx  was fortuitously found to be a novel, potent inhibitor of the x⫺
c transporter. it showed high rat lymphoma growth-inhibitory and lytic
activity in vitro (ic50 ⴝ 0.16 mm), based specifically on inhibition
of x⫺
c -mediated cystine uptake, in contrast to its colonic metabolites, sulfapyridine and  xxxd2579xxx .  xxxd3255xxx 
was even more effective against human non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (dohh2) cultures. in rats (n ⴝ 13),  xxxd3255xxx  (i.p.)
markedly inhibited growth of well-developed, rapidly growing
rat nb2 lymphoma transplants without apparent side-effects.
reduced, macrophage-mediated supply of cysteine was probably involved. in five rats, 90–100% tumor growth suppression,
relative to controls, was obtained. the x⫺
c cystine transporter
represents a novel target for  xxxd3255xxx -like drugs with high
potential for application in therapy of lymphoblastic and other
malignancies dependent on extracellular cyst(e)ine. leukemia

introduction
in past decades, signiﬁcant advances have been made in the
treatment of lymphomas and leukemias, primarily as a result
of combination chemotherapy. a cure for these malignancies,
however, has not yet been accomplished.1 to identify new
therapeutic targets and potentially useful drugs for treatment
of these diseases, we developed an experimental in vitro and
in vivo model for lymphoblastic cancers as they progress
toward greater malignancy.2 the model consists of a rat pret ‘nb2 lymphoma’ cell line at an early stage of malignant
progression and sublines representing different stages of
advanced progression, including growth factor autonomy and
increased metastatic ability.2,3 in view of the origin and cytokine dependence of the parental line, the nb2 lymphoma cell
lines may serve as a model for lymphoblastic non-hodgkin’s
lymphoma (nhl) and childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (all).1,2
our research focused on a speciﬁc growth and viability
requirement of lymphoid cells. l-cystine, or its reduced form,
l-cysteine, is nutritionally a non-essential amino acid since it
can be generated in the body from  xxxd2595xxx . however,

mammalian cells of lymphoid origin, including human leukemic cells, are unable to synthesize cyst(e)ine from methionine, rendering the cells critically dependent on uptake of the
amino acid from their micro-environment.4 nb2 lymphoma
cell lines are also dependent on extracellular cyst(e)ine for
growth.5 lymphoid cells typically exhibit a low uptake capability for cystine as distinct from cysteine which they take up
readily.6 in culture medium, cystine is the predominant form
of the amino acid due to rapid oxidation of cysteine.7 consequently, lymphoid cell cultures generally require addition of
a cystine uptake enhancer such as  xxxd26xxx  ( xxxd26xxx )
or elevated levels of cystine in the medium.5,7 alternatively,
the cultures can be maintained using feeder layers of macrophages which provide the lymphoid cells with cysteine.8 this
phenomenon is based on the ability of macrophages to take
up extracellular cystine via a plasma membrane cystine transporter (x−c ), reduce the amino acid intracellularly and secrete
it as cysteine.8,9 this mechanism is apparently also used by
macrophages in vivo to supply lymphocytes with cysteine to
induce their activity.10,11
recently, we showed that the malignant progression of the
nb2 lymphoma was associated with expression by nb2sfjcd1 subline cells of an active x−c cystine transporter, as
used by macrophages. this acquired property enhanced the
growth autonomy of these subline cells, enabling them to take
up extracellular cystine in contrast to other nb2 cell lines.5
the studies led to the suggestion that the x−c cystine transporter
provided a potentially useful target for therapy of lymphoblastic malignancies. its inhibition in vivo would not only inhibit
cystine uptake by lymphoma cells expressing an x−c cystine
transporter, but also reduce cystine uptake by macrophages
and hence interfere with the maintenance of cysteine levels
in the circulation.5 the latter effect could lead to a marked
decrease in plasma cysteine levels since cysteine has a short
half-life.7 it was envisioned that a short-term inhibition of the
x−c cystine transporter, as induced by a drug, could promote
elimination of relatively fast growing lymphoma cells by cysteine starvation without major side-effects to the host.
in the present study, a number of clinically useful drugs was
screened for inhibition of the x−c cystine transporter. it was
found that  xxxd3255xxx , an immunosuppressant, is a novel
and potent inhibitor of this transporter. in vitro,  xxxd3255xxx 
at therapeutic levels markedly inhibited lymphoma cell replication, in contrast to its colonic metabolites sulfapyridine and
 xxxd2579xxx , an effect based speciﬁcally on inhibition of x−c -mediated cystine uptake. intraperitoneal administration of  xxxd3255xxx  to rats led to a high reduction in growth
of lymphoma transplants without major toxicity to the hosts,
indicating that this drug has a high potential for application
in therapy of lymphoblastic malignancies, as outlined in a preliminary account.12

materials and methods

materials
all drugs, compounds, solvents or culture media were
obtained from sigma-aldrich canada ltd, oakville, on,
canada, unless otherwise indicated.

cell cultures
nb2-sfjcd1 cells were cultured as suspensions in fischer’s
medium (fm) supplemented with 10% horse gelding serum
(lactogen-deﬁcient; one batch, icn biomedicals, aurora, oh,
usa), penicillin (50 u/ml) and streptomycin (50 ␮g/ml), as
previously described.2,5 fm is cysteine-free but contains cystine at 84 ␮m. the supplemented culture medium supports
proliferation of nb2-sfjcd1 cells in absence of cystine uptake
enhancers such as  xxxd26xxx  by virtue of their x−c transporter.5 nb2u17 cells were cultured in fm, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (gibco-brl, burlington, on, canada), antibiotics and  xxxd26xxx  (60 ␮m).2,5 dohh2 lymphoma cells13 were
cultured in fm, or rpmi-1640 (stem cell technologies, vancouver, bc, canada), supplemented with 5% horse serum, 5%
fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.

in vitro drug testing
drugs were tested for culture growth-inhibitory properties as
solutions in culture medium with the ph adjusted to 7.5–7.7.
indomethacin,  xxxd2969xxx , ibuprofen and aspirin were solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide and tested as solutions containing
0.2% of the vehicle, a concentration which did not interfere
with culture growth. solubilization of  xxxd3255xxx  and sulfapyridine involved use of 0.1 n naoh and adjustment of the
ph using 1 n hcl, which was added slowly to the solutions
swirled by a magnetic stirrer to avoid precipitation of the compounds. drug and vehicle solutions were prepared and
assayed under subdued light conditions. for the assays, nb2sfjcd1 cells from log phase cultures (doubling time = 13 h)
were centrifuged (3.5 min at 350 g) and resuspended in fresh
fm containing 10.0% horse serum and antibiotics. aliquots
(1.80 ml) were distributed in 12-well tissue culture plates
(linbro, flow laboratories, mississauga, on, canada) and
preincubated for 2–5 h at 37°c in a water-saturated 5%
co2/air atmosphere. solutions of the drugs at a range of concentrations (200 ␮l portions; in triplicate) were then added to
the cultures for a 45 h incubation (cin = 1.0 × 105 cells/ml).
cell populations were determined using an electronic counter
(coulter electronics, hialeah, fl, usa). culture growth inhibitions were calculated from the cell number increases found
at hour 45 in drug-treated cultures and their controls. percent
inhibition = 100 − (increasedrug-treated/increasecontrol) × 100.
assays using nb2-u17 cells were carried out with their maintenance medium (doubling time = 20 h); cin = ca. 1.5 × 105
cells/ml. assays using dohh2 cells were performed with fm,
or rpmi-1640, containing fetal bovine serum (5.0%), horse
serum (5.0%) and antibiotics (doubling time = 22 and 19 h,
respectively); cin = ca. 1.5 × 105 cells/ml.

serum and 10 mm hepes (n-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-n⬘[2-ethanesulfonic acid]), ph 7.2 (ca. 107 cells/ml) were preincubated with drugs for ca. 20 min. they were then further
incubated for 15 min with 35s-l-cystine (amersham canada,
oakville, on, canada; 10.7 ␮ci/ml, 57 ␮m) and cellassociated radioactivity processed as previously described.5
brieﬂy, ice-cooled 200 ␮l aliquots of cell suspension were layered on to 200 ␮l aliquots of a mixture of  xxxd2648xxx  and di-nbutyl phtalate (10:90, v:v) in eppendorf centrifuge tubes and,
following centrifugation and aspiration of the supernatants,
the tips of the centrifuge tubes were cut off and the cell pellets
solubilized for counting in a liquid scintillation counter.5

northern blot analysis
total rna was isolated from 2 × 107 log phase cells using
rnazol-b (tel-test, friendswood, tx, usa) and quantiﬁed
spectrophotometrically. the rna was denatured in formaldehyde and fractionated on 1% agarose gels and then transferred to genescreen plus (dupont, wilmington, de, usa).
equal loading per lane was veriﬁed by ethidium bromide
staining of 18s and 28s ribosomal rna, which was visualized
and photographed under uv illumination. analysis was carried out using macrophage-derived 4f2hc and  xxxg2156xxx  cdna
probes (kindly provided by dr s bannai, university of tsukuba, ibaraki, japan), labeled with 32p. labeling, hybridization
and washing procedures were conducted as previously
described.14

testing of  xxxd3255xxx  efﬁcacy in vivo
rats were used from a colony of noble rats maintained by
random litter-mate breeding in micro-isolator cages in the bc
cancer research centre.2 tolerated dosages of  xxxd3255xxx 
were established using non-tumor-bearing animals. for drug
efﬁcacy studies, approximately equal portions of minced nb2u17 tumor tissue, developed in a rat following subcutaneous
(s.c.) injection of nb2-u17 cells, were injected by trocar s.c.
in the nape of the neck of groups of male rats (one injection
per rat), that had been lightly anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(abbott laboratories, montreal, canada).2 when the single
tumors reached a measurable size (ca. 1 cm3), therapy of the
animals (350–400 g) was started using intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections at a site remote from the transplant at approximately
12 h intervals. fresh  xxxd3255xxx  solutions were prepared
every day in 0.1 n naoh subsequently adjusted with 1 n hcl
to a ph of about 8. phosphate-buffered saline was used for
controls. drug preparation and administration were carried
out under subdued light conditions. food and water were provided ad libitum. tumor size, body weight and general health
of the rats were monitored daily. tumor size was measured
using calipers and expressed in grams using the formula: ␲/6
× length × width × height in cm.15 animals were killed by
carbondioxide asphyxiation as required by the protocol or as
soon as they showed signs of stress. tissue sectioning and histologic analysis were carried out by criterion service laboratory, vancouver, bc, canada (pathologist: dr jean leriche,
bc cancer agency). animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the canadian
council on animal care.

screening of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(nsaids) for x−c inhibition

following the lack of success in identifying a speciﬁc x−c
inhibitor, further research focused initially on the salicylates.
with regard to  xxxd3219xxx , it may be noted that its lymphoma growth-inhibitory activity was apparently not based on
inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox-1) activity. thus, the
growth-inhibitory potency of salicylate was signiﬁcantly
greater than that of aspirin, by a factor of 1.7 (table 1a),
whereas aspirin has a ⬎20-fold higher anti-cox-1 activity
than salicylate, as reported.17 with regard to aspirin it appears
likely that its lymphoma growth-inhibitory activity was
mediated by salicylate, a major metabolite of aspirin.22 salicylates are known to inhibit activation of  xxxg1559xxx , a transcription factor important in regulation of inﬂammatory
responses.24 on the off-chance that their lymphoma growthinhibitory activities were based on inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx 
activation, we extended our studies to include  xxxd3255xxx ,
a salicylate derivative reported to be a potent inhibitor of
 xxxg1559xxx  activation.25  xxxd3255xxx  was ﬁrst synthesized in
the 1940s as a combination of sulfapyridine, an antibiotic, and
 xxxd2579xxx , an anti-inﬂammatory agent, linked by
an azo bridge. it is commonly used to treat chronic inﬂammatory diseases such as inﬂammatory bowel (crohn’s) disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.25  xxxd3255xxx  is usually administered orally and approximately 70% of the drug is degraded
by colonic bacteria via azo cleavage to sulfapyridine and 5aminosalicylic acid, compounds with different modes of
action. in crohn’s disease,  xxxd2579xxx  and  xxxd3255xxx  appear to have equivalent activity, each superior to that
of sulfapyridine, whereas, in rheumatoid arthritis, sulfapyridine is the active moiety.25 the mechanism of action of  xxxd3255xxx  per se is still unclear, but the drug has been demonstrated to inhibit a number of immunological processes,
including interleukin-2 synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation, as well as interleukin-1 production by monocytes.26 in
addition to its inhibitory effect on  xxxg1559xxx  activation,25  xxxd3255xxx  has been reported to inhibit glutathione-stransferases;27 it is not classiﬁed as an nsaid.26 in studying
 xxxd3255xxx , we found that it potently inhibited nb2-sfjcd1
culture growth, exhibiting an ic50 of 0.16 mm (table 1b). this
raised the possibility that the drug had potential as a chemotherapeutic agent, since  xxxd3255xxx  levels in plasma from
children as high as 70.7 ␮g/ml (0.18 mm) have been
reported.28

a literature search indicated that certain nsaids inhibited the
x−c cystine transporter16 with a potency roughly similar to their
prostaglandin
synthesis
( xxxg1883xxx )
inhibitory
activity.17 moreover, some nsaids exhibit anticancer
activity.18 a study was therefore initiated to determine
whether such drugs could arrest growth of nb2 lymphoma
cell cultures by inhibition of x−c -mediated cystine uptake. nb2sfjcd1 subline cultures were used in which cell proliferation
critically depended on uptake of cystine via the x−c transporter.5 a variety of clinically useful nsaids, spanning a
range of anti-inﬂammatory potency, was tested, including
indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis,
and  xxxd3219xxx , a much weaker nsaid.17 the drugs
were assayed at a range of concentrations spanning their
‘therapeutic serum/plasma levels’, as reported for patients
undergoing treatment for inﬂammatory diseases. it was found
that all the nsaids tested were able to abrogate population
growth in a concentration-dependent fashion. table 1a shows
the ic50s obtained for selected nsaids, presented in order of
decreasing anti-cyclooxygenase activity17 vs their therapeutic
levels in the circulation.19–22 in general, the growth-inhibiting
potency of the drugs declined with decreasing anti-cyclooxygenase activity. however, the ic50s of indomethacin,  xxxd2969xxx 
and ibuprofen markedly exceeded their therapeutic levels, in
contrast to the ic50s of the salicylates, aspirin (acetylsalicylic
acid) and  xxxd3219xxx , which were in the same range as
their therapeutic levels. this suggested that, of the nsaids
studied, only the salicylates had therapeutic potential. however, in no case could nsaid-induced growth arrest be substantially reduced by supplying the cells with cysteine via
addition of  xxxd26xxx  (ca. 60 ␮m), a thiol which allows cellular
uptake of cystine via the leucine transporter23 (data not
shown). (this procedure had previously been used to overcome highly speciﬁc, monosodium glutamate-induced inhibition of the x−c transporter.5) taken together, the results indicate that the observed culture growth-inhibitory activities of
the nsaids were not based on major inhibition of the x−c cystine transporter, but involved different mechanisms of action.

effects of  xxxd3255xxx  and its colonic metabolites on
lymphoma culture growth
the effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on growth of nb2-sfjcd1 cultures
is shown in figure 1a. at 0.3 mm it induced severe cell lysis
commencing after approximately 24 h and resulting in near
total cell death; microscopic observation showed that cell
numbers at hour 45 essentially represented lysing cells. however, even after 17 h of incubation with  xxxd3255xxx  at such
a lytic concentration, cells fully recovered following resuspension in drug-free medium (data not shown). this suggests that
continuous exposure to the drug is required for complete
elimination of the cells.
a comparison of growth-inhibitory activities of  xxxd3255xxx 
and its colonic metabolites (figure 1b) showed that whereas
0.1–0.3 mm  xxxd3255xxx  was effective, both sulfapyridine
and  xxxd2579xxx  were without any inhibitory activity
in this concentration range which exceeded their therapeutic

plasma levels (0.08–0.2 mm29 and ca. 0.01 mm30 for sulfapyridine and  xxxd2579xxx , respectively). these results
suggest that the observed growth-inhibitory activity of  xxxd3255xxx  reﬂected action of the intact molecule and was not
based on a metabolite such as sulfapyridine, responsible for
the activity of  xxxd3255xxx  in rheumatoid arthritis.25

inhibitory effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on growth of human
nhl cell cultures
 xxxd3255xxx  also markedly inhibited proliferation of the b
cell type, non-hodgkin’s dohh2 lymphoma cell line.13 as
shown in figure 2a, these human lymphoblastic cells were
much more sensitive to  xxxd3255xxx  than the rat nb2-sfjcd1
cells when compared under similar conditions, ie suspended
in fischer’s medium. severe lysis of dohh2 cells was
observed at concentrations as low as 0.15 mm  xxxd3255xxx .

 xxxd3255xxx  action based on inhibition of the x−c
cystine transporter
a comparison of the growth-inhibitory potencies of  xxxd3255xxx  in cultures of nb2-sfjcd1 and nb2-11 subline cells
showed that the efﬁcacy of the drug was substantially lower
in the nb2-11 cell cultures (data not shown). this unexpected
ﬁnding raised the possibility that the growth-inhibitory activity
of  xxxd3255xxx  could be overcome by  xxxd26xxx , a growth
requirement of nb2-11 cultures as distinct from nb2-sfjcd1
cultures.5 as shown in figure 2b, the presence of  xxxd26xxx 
(60 ␮m) in nb2-sfjcd1 cultures indeed reduced the very high
growth inhibitions induced by 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm  xxxd3255xxx  by ca. 90% and 80%, respectively. furthermore, increasing cystine levels in fischer’s medium from 84 ␮m to ca.
230 ␮m also reduced the efﬁcacy of the drug, evidence that
the action of  xxxd26xxx  was based on enhanced uptake of cystine
(data not shown). consistent with the latter is the much lower
growth inhibition by  xxxd3255xxx  in dohh2 cultures suspended in rpmi-1640, containing 207 ␮m cystine, compared
to dohh2 cultures in fischer’s medium containing only
84 ␮m cystine (figure 2a). in this regard, it is notable that the
concentration of cystine in fischer’s medium approximates
leukemia

the levels of cyst(e)ine in human plasma.31 it may also be
noted that  xxxd3255xxx  at relatively high concentrations (0.3
and 0.4 mm) had only minor inhibitory effects on the proliferation of parental nb2-u17 cells propagated in the presence
of 60 ␮m  xxxd26xxx  (figure 2b).
as previously reported, uptake of extracellular cystine by
nb2-sfjcd1 cells in vitro is primarily mediated by the x−c cystine transporter,5 a cystine/glutamate antiporter system.9 this
had been demonstrated by an 85% inhibition of 35s-l-cystine
uptake induced by 10 mm monosodium glutamate in a highly
speciﬁc and na+-independent fashion.5 in the present study,
0.3 mm  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited uptake of 35s-l-cystine by nb2sfjcd1 cells to the same extent as 10 mm monosodium glutamate (figure 3).  xxxd3255xxx , however, did not appear to
interfere with  xxxd26xxx -enhanced uptake of 35s-l-cystine which
presumably proceeds via the leucine transporter23 (figure 3).
taken together, the results in figures 2a, b and 3 show that
the growth-inhibitory activity of  xxxd3255xxx  in the lymphoma cell cultures was based on a potent and highly speciﬁc
inhibition of the x−c cystine transporter leading to intracellular
depletion of cyst(e)ine. furthermore, the action of the drug
may be based on competitive inhibition, since the efﬁcacy of

methods). columns and error bars represent means ± s.d.

the drug was reduced by increasing the levels of cystine in
the medium.

expression of the x−c cystine transporter in cell lines
recently, the x−c cystine transporter was cloned by sato and
co-workers.32 it was found to be a protein heterodimer consisting of 4f2hc, a common component of amino acid transporters, and  xxxg2156xxx , which provides speciﬁcity for cystine.32
using macrophage-derived 4f2hc and  xxxg2156xxx  cdna probes, we
found that each of four examined lymphoma cell lines
expressed 4f2hc mrna. in contrast, the 12 kb  xxxg2156xxx  transcript
was not found in nb2-u17 or nb2–11 cells, but only in nb2sfjcd1 and dohh2 cells (figure 4). the absence of an x−c
cystine transporter in nb2-u17 and nb2-11 cells is consistent
with their growth requirement for cystine uptake enhancement
by  xxxd26xxx  when cultured in fischer’s medium which contains
relatively low cystine levels.5 the expression of the transporter
in nb2-sfjcd1 and dohh2 cells is in agreement with their
ability to proliferate in such medium in the absence of cystine
uptake enhancers.5

suppression of tumor growth in rats by  xxxd3255xxx 
the effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on tumor growth was evaluated
using noble rats, each carrying a single, well-developed, rapidly growing, subcutaneous rat lymphoma transplant. parental, cyst(e)ine-dependent nb2-u17 tumors were utilized
since they are non-metastatic, in contrast to nb2-sfjcd1
tumors.2,5 use of non-metastatic tumors would avoid dissemination of cells from the tumor which would interfere with the
use of tumor mass as a measure of drug-induced tumor growth
inhibition. in preliminary experiments, oral administration of
 xxxd3255xxx  had a minor tumor growth-arresting effect. this
led to a more comprehensive study in which  xxxd3255xxx  was

probes. equal loading of rna was veriﬁed by ethidium bromidestained 18s and 28s ribosomal rna (rrna).

administered (1) intraperitoneally, to avoid its degradation in
the gut and concomitant loss of growth-inhibitory activity, and
(2) at 12 h intervals, in an attempt to maintain elevated levels
of the drug in the circulation. as shown in figure 5, tumor
transplants in saline-treated control rats (n = 6) grew rapidly
from 0.95 g (range 0.30–1.76 g) to 12.60 g (10.59–16.12 g) in
7 days, consistent with rapid growth of nb2-u17 transplants
observed in previous studies.2 in contrast, tumor growth was
substantially inhibited in the two groups of rats treated with
 xxxd3255xxx  (total n = 13).  xxxd3255xxx  at a dose of
200 mg/kg body weight, twice a day (n = 8) reduced tumor
growth by nearly 80% on average as indicated by an increase
in tumor mass from an average of 0.93 g (0.45–1.84 g) to only
3.43 g (1.18–6.59 g). similar results were obtained with the
higher  xxxd3255xxx  dosage. it is notable that  xxxd3255xxx 
inhibited tumor growth in ﬁve of the 13 rats by 90–100%
when compared with the average increase in tumor mass of
the controls. it is not known if the lower tumor growth suppressions reﬂect temporary decreases in the levels of circulating  xxxd3255xxx  which could have been avoided by administering the drug at shorter intervals.
at necropsy there was no evidence of metastatic spread of
the  xxxd3255xxx -treated tumors to liver, spleen and kidney,
target tissues for metastatic nb2 lymphoma cell lines.2 histological analysis (n = 4) of these tissues conﬁrmed this observation, indicating that the suppressive effect of  xxxd3255xxx 
on the nb2-u17 tumors was not the result of drug-induced
dissemination of tumor cells from the transplant site, but
reﬂected tumor growth inhibition. importantly, at the dosages
used,  xxxd3255xxx  caused no apparent toxicity to the host, as
indicated by the good general health of the tumor-bearing rats
(n = 13) during treatment and by the necropsy results. control,
non-tumor-bearing animals (n = 5) receiving an identical 7day treatment with the drug and followed over a 3–6 month
period, showed good health with only a temporary halt in
leukemia

of male rats (350–400 g), each carrying a single tumor in the nape of

of saline (controls, n = 6; open bars), sasp at 200 mg/kg body weight

height of the tumors in cm.15 each bar of the ‘day 0’ group, and the
corresponding bar in the ‘day 7’ group, represent the mass of
one particular tumor at the beginning and end of the treatment,
respectively.

their weight gain; scar tissue at the sites of injections disappeared within a few weeks. taken together, the results of these
in vivo studies demonstrate that  xxxd3255xxx  was highly
effective at inhibiting growth of transplanted nb2-u17 lymphomas without signiﬁcantly affecting the health of the hosts.
discussion
the present study has identiﬁed, for the ﬁrst time, that  xxxd3255xxx  is a potent inhibitor of the x−c cystine transporter. this
fortuitously discovered property of  xxxd3255xxx  was demonstrated by its marked inhibition of the uptake of 35s-l-cystine
by nb2-sfjcd1 cells, a process which is mediated by the x−c
transporter5 (figure 3). the inhibition of the x−c transporter
appears to be primarily responsible for the lymphoma growthinhibitory activity of  xxxd3255xxx  in vitro (figures 1a, b and
2a), since growth arrest could be largely prevented by addition
of  xxxd26xxx  which enhances cystine uptake via a different route,
ie the leucine transporter23 (figure 2b). the in vitro growthinhibitory activity of  xxxd3255xxx  is not based on its components, sulfapyridine or  xxxd2579xxx  (figure 1b), in
contrast to its anti-inﬂammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis
and crohn’s disease, and in this regard resembles its inhibitory
effect on  xxxg1559xxx  activation.25 it is notable that there is
apparently no correlation between inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx 
activation, as induced by salicylates, and inhibition of cell
proliferation.24 subsequent studies are needed to determine
leukemia

the relationship between the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3255xxx 
on cystine uptake and its inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  activation.
it is not yet clear how  xxxd3255xxx -induced cyst(e)ine starvation caused death of the lymphoma cells in vitro. however,
it has been reported that incubation of human jurkat t leukemic cells in cystine- and glutathione-free medium led to a
build-up of intracellular peroxides and cell death by apoptosis
within 18–24 h.33 it is likely that  xxxd3255xxx -induced cell
lysis in nb2-sfjcd1 and dohh2 cultures (figures 1a and 2a)
developed along similar lines. the observed 24-h interval
prior to the onset of lysis of nb2-sfjcd1 cells incubated with
0.3 mm  xxxd3255xxx  (figure 1a) is consistent with a gradual
intracellular depletion of cyst(e)ine. the latter would naturally
lead to a decrease in the intracellular levels of glutathione,
a major free radical-scavenger with a short half-life which is
generated from cysteine, leaving the cells less protected
against oxidative stress.33 the ﬁnding that continuous
exposure to the drug is needed to induce cell lysis is also consistent with a starvation process. the reported inhibitory effect
of  xxxd3255xxx  on glutathione-s-transferases, enzymes
involved in protection of cells from oxidative stress,27 together
with depletion of glutathione,33 would facilitate lysis of the
tumor cells by metabolism-generated peroxides. furthermore,
inhibition by  xxxd3255xxx  of  xxxg1559xxx  activation25 would
prevent cells from expressing anti-apoptotic genes as a
protective response against injury.34
in analyzing the suppression by  xxxd3255xxx  of lymphoma
growth in the animal, one has to take into account that, in
vivo, the lymphoma cells are exposed not only to cystine, but
also to cysteine which they can take up readily.6,8 this implies
that cyst(e)ine starvation of the lymphoma cells in vivo cannot
be achieved by a direct  xxxd3255xxx –tumor cell interaction
leading to inhibition of cystine uptake, unless there is a concomitant reduction in the supply of plasma cysteine. in the
case of the nb2-u17 tumor transplants (figure 5), the lymphoma cells did not possess an x−c cystine transporter (figure
4). furthermore, nb2-u17 cell proliferation in vitro was not
greatly affected by  xxxd3255xxx , even at 0.4 mm, when  xxxd26xxx 
was present allowing pick up of extracellular cystine (figure
2b). the latter condition closely resembles an in vivo situation, in which lymphoma cells have access to circulating
cysteine. it appears therefore that the suppression of nb2-u17
lymphoma growth by  xxxd3255xxx  (figure 5) was not due to
a direct drug–tumor cell interaction, but involved an indirect
effect of the drug. as a potent inhibitor of the x−c cystine transporter,  xxxd3255xxx  probably interfered with secretion of cysteine by somatic cells (eg macrophages), described by
gmünder et al,11 in which the generation of cysteine is dependent on x−c -mediated uptake of cystine. the reduction in cysteine delivery to the tumor cells could have caused a decrease
in their intracellular cyst(e)ine levels below a critical threshold
leading to inhibition of growth. an inhibitory effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on somatic cell-mediated supply of cysteine could also
underlie some of its immunosuppressive actions in vivo,
including its inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.26
the present study indicates that  xxxd3255xxx , a drug commonly used for treatment of severe inﬂammatory diseases,
could also be useful as an anticancer agent based on its inhibition of the x−c cystine transporter. the marked suppression
by  xxxd3255xxx  of rat nb2 pre-t cell lymphoma growth in
vivo without major toxicity to the host (figure 5), together with
its efﬁcacy against human dohh2 b-cell lymphoma cells in
vitro (figure 2a), suggest that  xxxd3255xxx  has potential application in clinical treatment of cancers dependent on extracellular cyst(e)ine for growth and viability. such malignancies

inhibition of lymphoma growth by  xxxd3255xxx 
pw gout et al

would include lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas (eg
nhl) of both b and t cell origin. since the oncolytic activity
of  xxxd3255xxx  is apparently based on cyst(e)ine depletion
within target cells, associated with loss of protection against
oxidative stress, it appears advantageous to utilize  xxxd3255xxx  in combination with oxidative stress-causing drugs (eg
alkylating agents). furthermore, since the colonic metabolites
of  xxxd3255xxx  have no growth-inhibitory activity (figure 1b),
the drug should not be administered via the gl tract.
cancer treatment using  xxxd3255xxx  would resemble use of
 xxxd230xxx , commonly applied in combination chemotherapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia, aimed at depletion
of circulating asparagine, an essential amino acid for certain
leukemic cells.35 attempts to develop therapy for leukemias
on the basis of cyst(e)ine depletion have been reported.36
notably, a differential growth response between normal and
certain leukemic cells was observed in culture. whereas both
types of cells required cyst(e)ine for growth, the normal cells
could replicate in the absence of the amino acid if lcystathionine, a precursor of l-cysteine, was supplied in the
medium, whereas the leukemic cells could not. the latter was
due to reduced levels in the leukemic cells of ␥-cystathionase
required for the generation of l-cysteine by cleavage of lcystathionine.36 these ﬁndings raise the possibility that
administration of l-cystathionine during  xxxd3255xxx  therapy
of ␥-cystathionase-deﬁcient cancers could have a protective
effect on normal lymphoid tissue. short-term exposure to cystathionine may be well tolerated since treatment with cystathionine has been used to protect rats from acute gastric
mucosal injury37 and extremely elevated levels of cystathionine have been observed in sera from patients with eg folate
deﬁciency.38
 xxxd3255xxx  may also be useful for treatment of malignancies other than lymphoblastic cancers. human lymphocytic4 and myelocytic36 leukemia cells, and cells from solid
cancers such as melanoma,36 neuroblastoma,36 and glioma39
have been reported to be dependent on extracellular
cyst(e)ine. cystine deprivation in vitro has also led to death
of lung ﬁbroblasts40 and preoligodendrocytes.41
in conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that the
x−c cystine transporter provides a useful target for therapy of
cancers which are dependent on extracellular cyst(e)ine for
growth and viability. the ﬁnding that  xxxd3255xxx  is a powerful inhibitor of this transport system may lead to the development of a new class of chemotherapeutic,  xxxd3255xxx -like
compounds.
