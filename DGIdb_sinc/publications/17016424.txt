abstract | since the molecular revolution of the 1980s, knowledge of the aetiology of cancer
has increased considerably, which has led to the discovery and development of targeted
therapies tailored to inhibit cancer-specific pathways. the introduction and refinement of
rapid, high-throughput screening technologies over the past decade has greatly facilitated
this targeted discovery and development process. here, we describe the discovery and
continuing development of sorafenib (previously known as  xxxd3226xxx ), the first oral
multikinase inhibitor that targets raf and affects tumour signalling and the tumour
vasculature. the discovery cycle of sorafenib (nexavar; bayer pharmaceuticals) — from
initial screening for a lead compound to fda approval for the treatment of advanced renal
cell carcinoma in december 2005 — was completed in just 11 years, with approval being
received ~5 years after the initiation of the first phase i trial.

the mainstays of cancer treatment during the twentieth
century were surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
however, surgery is not curative in cases of advanced
metastatic disease, and radiation and chemotherapy
are limited by severe side effects and a limited capacity
to discriminate between healthy and cancerous cells.
furthermore, these treatment modalities offer limited
therapeutic benefit to patients with solid tumours — the
most common malignancies — which are inherently
radio- and chemotherapy-resistant.
for the majority of the twentieth century, drug discovery
programmes focused on the development of novel cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, owing to a lack of understanding
of the molecular mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis.
however, in the 1980s, several groups began to identify
the key molecular changes responsible for malignant
transformation. these changes included the discovery of
both cancer-causing oncogenes and tumour-suppressor
genes that normally hold cancer in check1–7, and the
identification of epigenetic events such as promoter
methylation that predispose individuals to cancer by
switching genes that regulate cell growth on or off 8.
oncogenes are frequently activated by inherited or
spontaneous gain-of-function mutations or fusions with
other genes8, or they can be aberrantly expressed due
to amplification, increased promoter activity or protein

stabilization8, and so they have integral roles in the genesis of human tumours. the inherited or spontaneous loss
of function of tumour-suppressor genes resulting from
inactivating mutations or epigenetic events (for example, promoter hypermethylation) was also implicated
in tumorigenesis at this time3,8,9.
these landmark findings greatly contributed to our
molecular understanding of cancer, and subsequent
studies of oncogene function were instrumental in
delineating many of the key signal transduction pathways. several oncogenes were found to encode either
growth factors (for example,  xxxd292xxx )10, constitutively active
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) (for
example,  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr, also
known as  xxxg682xxx ); erbb2 (also known as her2/neu); and
fms)11–13, or non-receptor tyrosine kinases (for example,
src)14 that relay signals through the ubiquitous mapk
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) intracellular signaltransduction pathway, which is composed of raf, mek
(mapk kinase) and erk (extracellular signal-regulated
kinase). other oncogenes have since been confirmed
as encoding constitutively activated components of
the mapk cascade (ki-ras,  xxxg1605xxx  and b-raf v600e)15,16
or transcription factors that represent nuclear targets
of this signal-transduction pathway (myc, fos and
jun)17–19. the highly evolutionarily conserved mapk

signalling pathway regulates normal cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation, adhesion and motility by
relaying extracellular growth-factor signals to multiple
downstream nuclear effectors (for example, transcription factors) via rtks and ras20. it therefore became
clear that dysregulated activation of signalling through
the mapk pathway has a major role in human cancer,
including several well-vascularized solid tumour types
and haematological malignancies.
our increased understanding of the aetiology of cancer
at the molecular level since the 1980s has shifted the focus
of drug discovery and development over the past decade
away from non-specific chemotherapeutics and towards
rationally designed drugs that target cancer-specific
pathways. by inhibiting cancer-specific pathways, it was
hoped that the new targeted agents would spare normal
cells and thereby offer improved safety benefits over
standard chemotherapeutics, while also providing a
higher therapeutic index.

target selection:  xxxg1924xxx 
the raf  xxxg1377xxx  isoforms ( xxxg184xxx ,
b-raf and raf1 (or c-raf)) are the first kinases in the
mapk cascade and are pivotal regulators of cellular
proliferation and survival20. in addition, it has recently
been shown that wild-type raf1 can prolong cell
survival, independent of mapk signalling, by direct
interaction with anti-apoptotic and apoptotic regulatory proteins 20,21. dysregulated activation of these
direct raf pathways, which can be independent of raf ’s
kinase activity (that is, involve a mechanism other than
protein phosphorylation), might also be implicated
in tumorigenesis and the progression of several solid
tumour types20,21.
dysregulated signalling through  xxxg1924xxx  isoforms is
detected in ~30% of human cancers20. constitutive b-raf
activity can be caused by activating oncogenic mutations,
such as the b-raf v600e mutation, which is prevalent in
melanomas (63%)22 and papillary thyroid carcinomas (up
to 50%)23,24. wild-type raf1 is often hyperactivated in a
wide range of human solid tumours as a consequence
of constitutively active upstream oncogenic ras mutants,
or the overexpression of upstream growth factors and/or
their rtks in the absence of oncogenic mutations.
furthermore, constitutively active ras oncogenes (particularly  xxxg1285xxx ) are common in human solid tumours,
including 90% of pancreatic, 45% of colorectal, and 30%
of hepatocellular cancers (hcc), 35% of non-small-cell
lung cancers (nsclc), 15% of melanomas and 10% of
kidney tumours25. raf1 hyperactivation in the absence of
oncogenic mutations is common in renal cell carcinoma
(rcc) (50%)26 and hcc (100% in 30/30 biopsies)27,
and is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian28 and
androgen-insensitive prostate cancer29.
in 1989, kasid et al. demonstrated that disrupting
the raf1 gene using the specific antisense oligonucleotide (ason) isis 5132 inhibits the growth of human
lung, breast and ovarian tumour xenografts in athymic
mice30. this provided the first proof-of-concept that
the raf1 gene is a valid anticancer target. isis 5132 is a
20-base phosphorothioate ason designed to hybridize

836 | o ctober 2006 | volume 5

to the 3′-untranslated sequence of raf1, inducing its
degradation, and decreasing raf1 protein synthesis30.
interestingly, isis 5132 also decreased raf1 activity
and enhanced the sensitivity of several resistant human
tumour lines to cytotoxic agents and radiation30.
a collaboration between bayer pharmaceuticals and
onyx pharmaceuticals provided further validation of
raf1 as a target for anticancer drug design. they demonstrated that mice with colon, pancreatic or fibrosarcoma
human tumour xenografts harbouring oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx ,
and expressing an mek construct that disrupted signalling from raf to erk, survived twofold longer than
controls lacking this construct31.

medicinal and combinatorial chemistry
when the project team was formed in 1994, the reagents
and assays were available to identify a  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitor. a scintillation proximity assay for the high-throughput
screening (hts) and identification of selective raf/
mek/erk enzyme inhibitors had already been developed by mcdonald et al. at glaxo-wellcome inc.,
showing that this approach was feasible32. tumour cell
lines that contained oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  and/or b-raf mutations demonstrated upregulated signalling through the
raf–mek–erk pathway. such tumour lines would be
vital for performing the necessary in vitro and human
tumour xenograft studies required to identify and select
candidate  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors for further evaluation
in phase i clinical trials. so, the essential tools were
available to proceed with the discovery and development of a novel targeted raf1 kinase inhibitor for the
treatment of cancer.
at the onset of the medicinal chemistry programme
that led to sorafenib, there were no marketed kinase
inhibitors in the field of oncology. however, before the
approval of sorafenib, two first-generation targeted
anticancer agents — imatinib (gleevec; novartis) and
 xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva; genentech), which target bcr–abl
and egfr, respectively — had begun to show clinical
benefit33,34. several technologies designed to accelerate
the identification of innovative and effective targeted drugs were crucial to these successes35. hts, as
described above for the identification of selective raf/
mek/erk inhibitors, is one of these key methodologies,
which, along with combinatorial chemistry, has become
an essential component of the contemporary cancer
drug discovery process35,36. another crucial component was the introduction of early adme (absorption,
distribution, metabolism and elimination) optimization in lead identification to facilitate preclinical
proof-of-concept studies37.
by 1994, bayer and onyx had engaged in a collaboration to discover novel therapies targeting the ras–raf–
mek–erk pathway. hts screening for raf1 kinase
inhibitory activity was initiated in 1995, and eventually
led to the testing of about 200,000 compounds38,39. this
effort generated 3-thienyl urea 1 as a promising lead
compound, with a raf1 ic50 (half maximal inhibitory
concentration) of 17 mum (fig. 1).
the raf1 inhibitory potency of the lead 3-thienyl urea
was improved tenfold (that is, to 1.7 mum; compound 2)

inhibitor 1 was identified through high-throughput screening. medicinal chemistry
efforts described in the main text led to sorafenib.

by a 4-methyl substitution on the phenyl ring. however,
no variants of this 3-thienyl urea with ic50 values below 1
mum were identified while pursuing a traditional medicinal chemistry approach. a library of ~1,000 bis-aryl urea
analogues of the lead compound was then constructed,
using rapid parallel synthesis techniques. the objective
was to further explore the structure–activity relationships (sar) of the lead 3-thienyl urea compound, and
to improve its raf1 inhibitory potency. this combinatorial library was then screened against raf1 to identify
a new analogue, 3-amino-isoxazole (compound 3),
exhibiting a raf1 kinase ic 50 of 1.1 mum 39,40 (fig. 1) .
from this point, the inhibitory potency of compound 3
was increased fivefold (raf1 kinase ic50 230 nm) by
replacing its distal ring with a 4-pyridyl moiety (which
produced compound 4)40 (fig. 1). compound 4 also
showed decreased lipophilicity, improved aqueous
solubility and significant activity in hct116 proliferation assays. furthermore, the inhibition of hct116
cell proliferation by compound 4 was associated with
decreased phosphorylation (that is, decreased activation) of mek and erk31,41. compound 4 was found to
be orally available in mice, and to inhibit the growth of
hct116 xenografts in vivo, thereby providing proof
of principle for this new kinase inhibitor class.
further sar studies were then undertaken. this
effort revealed that although the urea moiety was
essential for raf1 kinase inhibitory activity, aromatic
replacements of the heterocyclic moiety of compound 4,
resulting in diphenyl ureas, were tolerated. finally,

nature reviews | drug discovery

modification of the distal pyridine ring, while maintaining the diphenylurea moiety, led to the identification
of sorafenib40,41 (fig. 1).
in vitro biochemical assays confirmed that sorafenib
is a potent in vitro inhibitor of raf1 kinase (ic50 of 6
nm) (table 1)42. sorafenib was also shown to potently
inhibit the wild-type b-raf, and oncogenic b-raf v600e
serine/threonine kinases, pro-angiogenic rtks ( xxxg2413xxx  receptors (vegfrs) 1/2/3,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (pdgfrbeta)
and  xxxg791xxx  ( xxxg791xxx )) and
other rtks involved in tumorigenesis (c-kit,  xxxg801xxx 
and ret) in vitro (table 1)42,43. with the exception of
wild-type b-raf, these molecular targets have been
implicated in the aetiology of several forms of human
cancer. however, sorafenib had no significant inhibitory
effect on  xxxg1361xxx ,  xxxg1369xxx , protein kinase b, protein kinase
a, protein kinase calpha, protein kinase-cgamma, egfr, her2/
neu or insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (igfr1) in
biochemical assays (table 1)42.
x-ray crystallographic studies of the complexes
formed between sorafenib and raf1, wild-type b-raf
and b-raf v600e were published in 2004 (ref. 44). the
distal 4-pyridyl ring of sorafenib occupies the atp
adenine binding pocket of the kinase domain, interacting with the conserved hinge region in a bidentate
fashion44. the lipophilic trifluoromethyl phenyl ring at
the opposite end of the molecule inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed between the alphac and alphae helices
and amino-terminal regions of the dfg motif and
catalytic loop. the urea functionality forms two crucial
hydrogen bonds, one with the backbone aspartate of the
dfg loop, the other with the glutamate side chain of the
alphac helix. although these x-ray data were not available
at the time of the identification of sorafenib, it provided,
after the fact, a clear rationale for most of the earlier
sar observations.
interestingly, the interaction between sorafenib
and raf1–wild-type b-raf turned out to show some
similarity with the interaction between c-abl and its
inhibitor, imatinib45. the net effect of sorafenib’s interactions with  xxxg1924xxx  is to stabilize the dfg motif in
an inactive conformation44.

pharmacological profile
as shown in fig. 2, sorafenib directly blocks the autophosphorylation of several receptor tyrosine kinases
( xxxg800xxx , 2 and 3, pdgfrbeta, c-kit and ret), as well as
inhibiting downstream  xxxg1924xxx  isoforms (wild-type
raf1, and b-raf and mutant b-raf v600e) in cell lines.
wilhelm et al. demonstrated that sorafenib inhibited
signalling through the mapk pathway in a broad range
of tumour cell lines harbouring oncogenic  xxxg1285xxx  and/
or b-raf mutations42. they also showed that sorafenib
induced dose-dependent inhibition of the corresponding human tumours when grown as xenografts into
athymic nude (nu/nu) mice42. furthermore, they demonstrated that sorafenib potently inhibited vegf- and
pdgfbeta-stimulated phosphorylation of  xxxg1274xxx  and
pdgfrbeta rtks, respectively, in human cells (table 1)42.

(both of which are b-raf v600e-positive) and dld-1

also induced complete tumour stasis in a breast carcinoma xenograft model (mda-mb-231 containing
g463v b-raf and  xxxg1285xxx  oncogenes). in addition, sorafenib inhibited the growth of a number of human
xenografts, including ovarian (sk-ov-3, overexpresses
egfr and her2/neu), pancreatic ( xxxg1285xxx -positive mia
paca 2), melanoma (lox, uacc 903 and 1205 lu containing b-raf v600e) and thyroid (containing oncogenic
ret)42,43,46. although sorafenib inhibited the growth of
two nsclc xenograft models (a549 and nci-h460),
inhibition of the mapk pathway was not evident in these
studies42. sorafenib’s inhibitory activity against human
colon colo-205 xenografts was also not associated

838 | o ctober 2006 | volume 5

with a detectable reduction in phosphorylated erk42.
therefore, sorafenib can inhibit the growth of some
tumour types by mechanisms other than a direct
tumour antiproliferative effect mediated by mapk
pathway inhibition — most probably by exerting potent
antivascular effects42,46.
sorafenib’s tumour growth-inhibitory effects could in
fact be attributed to inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, as
demonstrated by a significant reduction in microvessel
area and microvessel density in the colo-205 xenograft
model42. sorafenib also inhibited the growth of renal
tumours in the renca murine model by disrupting
the tumour vasculature47. presumably, inhibition of
endothelial cell  xxxg1274xxx  and pericyte pdgfrbeta activity
by sorafenib contributed to its anti-angiogenic effects in
these models.

a two-phase trial: in phase i all
patients are openly treated

with stable disease are
randomly assigned to continue
the same treatment or switch
to placebo.

in other human tumour xenograft models (mdamb-231 breast; ht-29 colon; plc/prf/5 hcc) 48,
sorafenib’s activity involved both inhibition of signalling through the mapk pathway (that is, an antiproliferative effect) and inhibition of angiogenesis.
sorafenib was also recently found to induce apoptosis
in several human cancer lines, including achn renal
carcinoma, ht-29 colon carcinoma, mda-mb-231
breast carcinoma, a549 nsclc, plc/prf/5 and
hepg2 hcc48, and kmch cholangiocarcinoma cells,
and jurkat (acute t-cell), k562 (chronic myelogenous)
and mec-2 (chronic lymphocytic) leukaemia cells. in
these cancer lines, sorafenib acted by downregulating
the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein  xxxg1388xxx  (myeloid
cell leukaemia sequence 1)49,50. furthermore, sorafenib
induced apoptosis of human melanoma cell lines by
an mek/erk- and caspase-independent mechanism,
which involved the nuclear translocation of apoptosisinducing factor51. the induction of tumour cell apoptosis might represent another mechanism of action for
sorafenib in a broad range of tumour types, and this
effect seems to involve inhibition of erk-independent
activities of raf1.

clinical development in rcc
as the molecular targets of sorafenib are involved in the
aetiology of many common malignancies, it was first
evaluated in a mixed population of patients with several
forms of advanced solid tumours.

nature reviews | drug discovery

phase i. the first phase i clinical trial evaluating oral
sorafenib tablets (as a tosylate salt) in patients with
advanced solid tumours was initiated in july 2000 (ref. 31).
a total of four single-agent phase i trials, evaluating
sorafenib oral doses ranging up to 800 mg twice daily
(bid), have now been completed and published52–55.
from these phase i trials, the optimum regimen and
maximum tolerated dose were determined as continuous oral administration of sorafenib at doses of 400 mg
bid56. dose-limiting toxicities in these studies included
grade 3 diarrhoea and fatigue at 800 mg bid, and grade
3 skin toxicity at 600 mg bid56. overall, sorafenib was
well tolerated and the majority of adverse events were
mild to moderate in severity and easily manageable52–56.
in these phase i trials, 11 patients with metastatic rcc
were evaluated for tumour response52–55 (recist). early
signals of antitumour activity were detected in one
patient with metastatic rcc, who had a confirmed
partial response (pr), which was sustained for 104 days
with sorafenib 600 mg bid54, and two additional rcc
patients who experienced sustained (≥2 years) stable
disease52,53.
sorafenib also demonstrated favourable tolerability and promising preliminary antitumour activity in
phase i combination trials with standard chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin57, 5-fluorouracil and
leucovorin58,  xxxd2824xxx carboplatin59, gemcitabine60,
doxorubicin61, taxotere62, cpt-1163 and  xxxd1796xxx 
(dtic)64. in these trials, the addition of sorafenib did
not significantly increase the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent. sorafenib also did not increase the
toxicity of interferon when co-administered with this
cytokine65,66.
rationale for rcc as target indication. rcc is a notoriously
chemoresistant, hypervascularized tumour type, often
associated with upregulated raf1, egfr, vegf and
vegfr activity26. furthermore, overexpression of vegf
and egfr are associated with poor prognosis in rcc67,68.
loss of function of the von hippel–lindau tumoursuppressor gene (vhl) in rcc results in the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors ( xxxg1048xxx  and hif2), and
consequent aberrant overexpression of transforming
growth factor-alpha (tgfalpha), and its receptor egfr, and
vegf69,70. in preclinical models, the tgfalpha–egfr autocrine loop has been shown to promote the growth of
vhl–/– rcc tumours, and vegf expression promotes
neoangiogenesis69,70. therefore, there was a strong rationale to support the use of an oral multikinase inhibitor,
such as sorafenib, for the treatment of advanced rcc.
phase ii/iii rcc. on the basis of the promising preliminary activity in rcc patients across the phase i
trials, bayer and onyx decided to evaluate sorafenib
monotherapy as a treatment for rcc by enriching the
recruitment of rcc in an accruing phase ii trial, with
a randomized discontinuation trial (rdt) design. the very
high rate of rcc patients who were progression-free
after 12 weeks of dosing in this phase ii trial led to the
initiation of the phase iii study to assess the safety and
activity of sorafenib. these two randomized controlled

trials confirmed sorafenib’s activity against rcc by
showing that it significantly prolonged progression-free
survival (pfs) compared with placebo in patients with
advanced disease71,72 (fig. 3a,b). these trials also confirmed that sorafenib was well tolerated by patients with
advanced rcc.
in the phase ii rdt, which involved 502 patients
with multiple tumour types, a total of 202 rcc
patients were evaluated. in this trial, significantly
more patients treated with sorafenib (16/32; 50%)
were progression-free at 12 weeks post-randomization,
compared with those on placebo (6/33; 18%; p <0.0077)71.
furthermore, sorafenib treatment significantly prolonged the median pfs fourfold over placebo treatment (24 weeks versus 6 weeks; p = 0.0087)71 (fig. 3a).
the phase iii treatment approaches in renal cancer

randomized controlled trial in rcc performed to
date, and involved 903 patients (intention-to-treat
cohort) with advanced rcc72. in this trial, sorafenib
was associated with a twofold increased median
pfs compared with placebo treatment (24 versus 12
weeks; p <0.000001)72 (fig. 3b). this pfs benefit was
independent of gender, age, prior therapy, mskcc
(memorial sloan-kettering memorial cancer center)
risk group73, baseline eastern cooperative oncology
group performance status and time since diagnosis72.
furthermore, patients receiving sorafenib experienced
a 39% improvement in overall survival relative to those
on placebo treatment (p <0.018; hazard ratio 0.72),
according to a planned survival analysis72, although
the pre-specified threshold for statistical significance
was not reached (o’brien–fleming stopping boundary: p ≤0.0005). nevertheless, the 28% reduction in
the risk of death indicates a trend towards improved
survival, consistent with the pfs results. in both of the
randomized and controlled rcc trials, sorafenib was
associated with a low pr rate, but the vast majority of
treated patents did experience some degree of tumour
shrinkage71,72.
the targets safety findings were generally consistent with those of the rdt studies. in targets,
the most common adverse events were dermatological
(rash 40% and hand–foot skin reaction 30%), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea 43%) and constitutional (fatigue
37%)72. these events were mostly grades 1–2 in severity. importantly, the comparative incidence rates of
fatigue, nausea, anorexia, vomiting and constipation
were similar in the sorafenib and placebo groups.
although hypertension was more prevalent among
patients receiving sorafenib (17%) than placebo (2%),
almost all cases of sorafenib-related hypertension were
grade 1–2 in severity72.
these phase ii/iii results established oral sorafenib
(400 mg bid) as a safe and effective new treatment for metastatic rcc and formed the basis for its fda marketing
approval in december 2005 for the treatment of
advanced rcc. the sorafenib discovery and development cycle — from initial lead compound to approval
— took ~11 years (timeline).

current development
rcc. clinical trials are ongoing to further evaluate sorafenib in rcc and address a number of issues. firstly,
a phase ii trial is underway to compare sorafenib with
interferon, the current standard of care for rcc. the
use of combinations of targeted agents that inhibit different cancer pathways is an attractive approach that
could further improve survival in notoriously resistant
tumours such as rcc. to address this possibility, trials
are underway to evaluate sorafenib in combination
with other targeted agents, including a phase ii trial
in combination with the  xxxd328xxx  monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (avastin; genentech/roche). the
combination of sorafenib with the egfr rtk inhibitor
 xxxd2029xxx  is also being evaluated in a phase ii trial.
two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase iii adjuvant trials are being planned in patients

other tumours. because sorafenib targets multiple
kinases involved in tumour growth and angiogenesis,
and has broad preclinical activity in several models of human cancer42, it would be anticipated to be
of clinical benefit in several solid tumour types. in a
phase ii trial, sorafenib monotherapy demonstrated a
median time to progression (ttp) of 5.7 months and
a median overall survival of 9.2 months in 137 hcc
patients with good hepatic function74. a phase iii trial
of sorafenib monotherapy is also ongoing for the treatment of advanced hcc. in a phase ii trial, in which
52 patients with metastatic, refractory nsclc received
sorafenib monotherapy75, 30 patients experienced stable

disease and there was evidence of tumour shrinkage in
15 patients75. sorafenib monotherapy has also shown
promise in early phase ii trials in patients with iodinerefractory metastatic papillary and follicular thyroid
carcinomas76, hormone-refractory prostate cancer77,78
and metastatic breast cancer79. single-agent sorafenib
is also being evaluated through the national cancer
institute’s cancer therapy evaluation program (ncictep) for the treatment of other tumours, including
head and neck cancer, sarcoma, small-cell lung cancer
(sclc) and mesothelioma80.
the favourable tolerability of sorafenib in singleagent trials has led to its evaluation in combination with
other anticancer therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunological agents and anti-angiogenic
agents. a phase i trial explored the combination of
sorafenib with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients
with solid tumours59. on the basis of preliminary evidence of efficacy, a further 105 patients with malignant
melanoma were enrolled in this trial. sorafenib in
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well
tolerated and demonstrated promising preliminary
antitumour activity in this cohort of patients with
malignant melanoma59. on the basis of these results,
two phase iii placebo-controlled trials have been
initiated to evaluate sorafenib in combination with
carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic

malignant melanoma. sorafenib is also currently being
evaluated in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel
in a phase iii placebo-controlled trial in patients with
nsclc. sorafenib has shown promise in combination
with  xxxd1796xxx  in patients with metastatic melanoma,
according to the recently reported preliminary results
of a phase ii trial81.
in addition, sorafenib is being evaluated in combination with the humanized antivascular endothelial
growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab in phase i trials82,83. preliminary results have
suggested that this combination has clinical activity
in patients with advanced solid tumours; however, the
dose-limiting toxicities are under investigation82,83. the
nci- xxxd3432xxx  is further evaluating sorafenib in combination with anticancer agents including interferonalpha,  xxxd2029xxx ,  xxxd3307xxx  and cetuximab (erbitux;
imclone/bristol-myers squibb) in a wide range of
tumour types.

future development
future issues for the development of sorafenib include
the identification and validation of appropriate biomarkers for improved patient selection, prognostication
and/or as response endpoints. preliminary biomarker
evaluations from a phase ii trial suggest that high baseline perk levels are indicative of sorafenib response in
hcc74. in addition,  xxxg1274xxx  (svegfr2) levels
were significantly decreased 3 weeks after initiating
sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced rcc in
targets84. this effect was sustained after 8 weeks of
sorafenib treatment. there was also a weak correlation
between the observed reduction in svegfr2 and target
lesion reduction84. these and other putative markers
identified by genomic profiling are being further evaluated. finally, ongoing and future preclinical and clinical
studies should soon cast light on sorafenib’s mechanism
of action in different tumour types, and determine
whether inhibition of its other target kinases confers
activity against other human malignancies. possible
target malignancies include acute myeloid leukaemia
and chronic myeloid leukaemia ( xxxg801xxx  and c-kit are
targets)85,86, imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal tumours
(c-kit is the target)87, and papillary thyroid carcinoma
(ret is the target)88.
it is anticipated that its favourable tolerability profile
will make sorafenib suitable for longer-term administration, either as a monotherapy or in combination with
other therapies.
conclusion
the drug discovery and development cycle of sorafenib, a rationally designed, targeted anticancer agent,
took ~11 years. sorafenib was approved by the fda for
the treatment of advanced rcc in december 2005, just
5 years after the initiation of the first phase i clinical
trials. the identification of a protein kinase involved
in tumorigenesis and progression, and the adoption
of state-of-the-art hts and combinatorial chemistry
approaches to identify novel compounds (bis-arylureas) that inhibit this target kinase (that is, raf1),
842 | o ctober 2006 | volume 5

greatly facilitated this process. the use of appropriate
in vitro cancer cell lines and models of human cancer
(that is, with upregulated mapk signalling) were instrumental in identifying the anticancer activity of sorafenib and ensuring that it translated its early promise
into the clinical setting.
among the molecular targets of sorafenib are several
rtks involved in angiogenesis ( xxxg800xxx , 2 and 3,
and pdgfrbeta) and tumorigenesis ( xxxg801xxx , c-kit and
ret). these additional molecular targets of sorafenib
might be responsible for its broad-spectrum activity
in several models of human cancer. it is clear from
the clinical trials reported above that the repertoire
of tumour types for which sorafenib could be applicable is rapidly expanding. the multiple molecular
targets of sorafenib might account for its antitumour
effects, as a single agent or in combination treatment,
in clinical trials in rcc71,72, hcc74, melanoma59,64,89
and nsclc90. similarly the multikinase inhibitory
profile of sorafenib leads to effects in cancer cells as
well as endothelial cells and pericytes of the tumour
vasculature. sorafenib inhibits tumour growth and
angiogenesis by inhibiting cellular proliferation, and
inducing apoptosis. anticancer agents with multiple
targets, or combinations of anticancer agents that act
on different pathways, might be more effective against
cancers with multiple molecular drivers, such as rcc,
and it could be less likely that resistance to these drugs
will develop in tumours than to agents targeting a
single pathway.
the early realization that targeted agents like sorafenib can show clinical efficacy without the evidence of
significant tumour shrinkage was also crucial to its successful clinical development. this observation about the
drug’s activity enabled inclusion of clinical endpoints
such as pfs and ttp in clinical trials of sorafenib,
to better demonstrate its disease-stabilizing effects.
if clinical trials of sorafenib had only incorporated
standard recist or endpoints defined by the world
health organization, which rely on the extent of
tumour shrinkage as a measure of response, sorafenib
might not have reached phase iii trials. although only
a small number of rcc patients treated with sorafenib
had prs in the rdt and targets clinical trials,
the majority of patients had some degree of tumour
shrinkage, and sorafenib significantly prolonged pfs
compared with placebo in these trials71,72.
in conclusion, in 2005, sorafenib, a molecularly
targeted agent that inhibits raf isoforms and  xxxg800xxx ,
2 and 3 rtks, became the first new treatment to be
approved by regulatory authorities for advanced rcc
in more than a decade. sorafenib also inhibits several
other rtks, such as pdgfrbeta, c-kit,  xxxg801xxx  and ret.
it is conceivable that sorafenib’s clinical activity is due
to its capacity to inhibit multiple kinases involved in
ubiquitous signalling pathways, which are dysregulated
in cancer. with its novel mechanisms of action, favourable safety profile and combinability demonstrated so
far with several standard chemotherapeutic agents,
sorafenib has potential clinical utility in a broad range
of tumour types.

discovery and development of sorafenib: a multikinase inhibitor for
treating cancer
scott wilhelm, christopher carter, mark lynch, timothy lowinger, jacques dumas, roger a. smith,
brian schwartz, ronit simantov and susan kelley
nature reviews drug discovery 5, 835–844 (2006); doi:10.1038/nrd2130

on page 836, the following sentence implies that an assay reported in 1999 by mcdonald and colleagues was used to discover
 xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors that led to sorafenib: “when the project team was formed in 1994, the reagents and assays were available
to identify a  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitor. a scintillation proximity assay for the high-throughput screening (hts)
and identification of selective raf/mek/erk enzyme inhibitors had already been developed by mcdonald et al. at
glaxo-wellcome inc., showing that this approach was feasible32.”
the authors wish to correct the text as follows: “when the project team was formed in 1994, the reagents and scintillation
proximity assay technology were availble to format a high-throughput assay for the identification of  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors. a
similar approach was also used by mcdonald et al. at glaxo-welcome inc., who identified  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors using a raf/mek/
erk spa hts assay32.”
the authors also wish to clarify that the primary objective of the randomized discontinuation trial (rdt) discussed on page
839 and 840 of the article was to test for disease-stabilizing activity of sorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer (crc), with
secondary endpoints for activity in other solid tumour types using a design by ratain. analysis of the rdt data indicated no
disease-stabilizing activity in metastatic crc patients, but confirmed the early clinical signals observed in metastatic renal cell
carcinoma (rcc) patients, and led to the study being refocused towards patients with metastatic rcc.
