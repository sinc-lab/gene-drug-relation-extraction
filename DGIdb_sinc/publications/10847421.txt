(received 8 november 1999; revised 8 february 2000; accepted 10 february 2000)
 xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor ( xxxg2266xxx ) is released to circulating blood after intravenous and subcutaneous injections of heparins,
and may thus contribute to the antithrombotic effect of heparins. a previous study suggested different abilities of various low
molecular weight heparins (lmwh) to release endogenous  xxxg2266xxx , but the dose±response relationship was not determined. in the
present study, the dose±response relationship for escalating doses of two lmwhs,  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin, on the release of
endogenous  xxxg2266xxx  was investigated. six healthy male participants were given 50, 100 and 200 u/kg  xxxd1805xxx  and 0.5, 1.0 and
2.0 mg/kg enoxaparin as a single subcutaneous injection. the study was a randomized, cross-over design with a 1-week wash-out
period between each injection. peak free  xxxg2266xxx  antigen and  xxxg2266xxx  activity were detected after only 1 h, whereas anti-activated factor
x (anti- xxxg741xxx ) and anti-activated factor ii (anti-fiia) activities were detected after 2±6 h. putative therapeutic equivalent doses of
 xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin gave similar release of endogenous  xxxg2266xxx , but dissimilar effects on anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities.

introduction
large randomized clinical trials indicate the superior
ef®cacy and safety of low molecular weight heparins
(lmwh) in comparison with conventional unfractionated heparin (ufh), both in the prophylaxis [1]
and for the treatment of venous [2] and arterial
thrombosis [3]. the antithrombotic mechanisms of
lmwhs are not fully understood. the main effect
is explained by facilitation of antithrombin-mediated
inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  ( xxxg741xxx ), whereas the main
action of ufh is due to antithrombin-mediated
inhibition of thrombin [activated factor ii (fiia)]
[4,5]. heparin fragments display different biochemical characteristics depending on the chain-length
distribution, which is responsible for varying ability
to inhibit factors xa and iia. some authors emphasize the importance of the anti-fiia effect [6,7],
whereas others underline the anti- xxxg741xxx  effect [8,9].

recent evidence indicates that enhancement of
 xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor ( xxxg2266xxx ) activity contributes to the antithrombotic effect of both
lmwhs and ufh [10].  xxxg2266xxx  probably plays an
important role in circumstances that lead to damage
of the vascular endothelium and activation of the
 xxxg748xxx  pathway of coagulation, e.g. in acute
coronary syndromes, after angioplasty, in septicaemia, and in cancer.  xxxg2266xxx  is released to circulating
blood after intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.)
injection of heparins [10]. in vitro studies indicate
that heparin-releasable  xxxg2266xxx  contributes signi®cantly to the antithrombotic effect of heparins [11].
a recent study from our laboratory showed that
plasma-free  xxxg2266xxx  antigen and heparin-releasable
 xxxg2266xxx  are depleted during repeated and continuous
i.v. infusion of ufh [12], but not during s.c.

treatment with lmwh [13]. moreover, treatment
with ufh by the s.c. route was also associated with
depletion of  xxxg2266xxx  but not with two lmwhs [14],
suggesting a different mode of action.
since lmwhs display distinct biochemical differences, it is widely accepted that each brand should
document their ef®cacy in clinical studies on thromboprophylaxis and treatment of venous and arterial
thrombosis, and establish the optimal dose regimens.
a previous study suggested different abilities of
various lmwhs to release endogenous  xxxg2266xxx , but
the dose±response relationship was not determined
[15]. the aim of the present study was to investigate
the dose±response relationship and the kinetic
pro®les for escalating doses of two lmwhs, i.e.
 xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin, on anti- xxxg741xxx  and antifiia activities, and the release of endogenous  xxxg2266xxx .

materials and methods
participants
six (n  6) healthy normolipaemic male medical
students/employees at the university of oslo (mean
age, 28 years; range, 22±40 years), who were consuming a traditional western diet, were recruited.
before inclusion, they underwent a clinical consultation including a medical history and a physical
examination. body weight and length, blood pressure, routine haematological and haemostatic variables (activated partial thromboplastin time and
prothrombin time), and routine clinical chemistry
were measured. exclusion criteria were regular use
of drugs, use of drugs that interfere with haemostasis, known general or local bleeding diathesis,
previous thrombotic disease, known arterial aneurysm, trauma or surgical treatment within the past
month before inclusion, hypertension, known hyperreactivity against heparin, liver and kidney disease, mental illness, and alcohol or drug abuse.
strenuous physical exercise and alcohol was avoided
48 h before each s.c. injection. the regional board
of research ethics (oslo, norway) approved the
study, and informed written consent was obtained
from each participant.
experimental design
in a randomized, cross-over design with a 1-week
wash-out period, the participants were given 50,
100, and 200 u/kg  xxxd1805xxx  (25 000 u/ml fragmin1; pharmacia & upjohn inc., stockholm, sweden) and 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg enoxaparin
(100 mg/10 000 u anti- xxxg741xxx /ml klexane1; rhoãne344

blood coagulation and fibrinolysis 2000, vol 11, no 4

poulenc rorer, paris, france) as a single s.c. injection.
blood sampling
blood samples were drawn at the following time
intervals; before injection, and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8
and 24 h after injection. blood was drawn through
an 18-gauge ven¯on (boc; ohmeda ab, helsingborg, sweden) or a 19-gauge needle into 5 ml
vacutainer1 tubes (becton-dickinson, meylan cedex, france) containing 0.5 ml of 0.129 mol/l buffered sodium citrate. blood was centrifuged at
2000 3 g for 15 min at 228c, and plasma was
transferred into 0.5 ml sterile cryovials and stored at
ÿ708c within 30 min. reference plasma was a pool
collected from 25 healthy blood donors (blood
bank, ullevaêl university hospital).
assays
 xxxg2266xxx  activity assay.  xxxg2266xxx  activity ( xxxg2266xxx  ac) was
assayed with a two-stage chromogenic substrate
assay [16]. the assay is a modi®cation of our
previously published assay of  xxxg2266xxx  activity [17]. in
short, the reaction mixture is made with molar
excess of recombinant factor viia molecules relative
to recombinant  xxxg748xxx . the reaction mixture is
incubated with diluted plasma containing  xxxg2266xxx  in
the presence of bovine activated  xxxg741xxx  and a
®brin polymerization inhibitor. in the second stage,
residual  xxxg748xxx /activated  xxxg750xxx  catalytic
activity is measured by the addition of a substrate
mixture containing bovine  xxxg741xxx  and a chromogenic substrate (s-22221, chromgenix ab, moèlndal,
sweden). the assay correlated well to the molar
concentration of  xxxg2266xxx , and  xxxg2266xxx  activity in the
reference plasma was de®ned as 1 u/ml.
free  xxxg2266xxx  antigen assay. the free  xxxg2266xxx  antigen
( xxxg2266xxx  ag) was assayed with a solid-phase two-site
enzyme immunoassay as described earlier [18]. the
method detects carrier-free and heparin-releasable
 xxxg2266xxx  molecules in plasma, but not lipoproteinassociated  xxxg2266xxx , and is insensitive to ufh (0±
10 iu) added to plasma in vitro [12].
anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities
anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities in plasma were
measured with commercial chromogenic assays,
coatest1 heparin (chromogenix ab, moèlndal,
sweden) and il testtm heparin (iia) (instrumentation laboratory, milano, italy), respectively. the
anti- xxxg741xxx  activity was calibrated with serial dilutions
(0±0.8 iu/ml) of a commercial calibrator (lmw
heparin anti- xxxg741xxx  standard; chromogenix) in pooled

 xxxg2266xxx  and release by lmwh

normal plasma. the calibrator was calibrated against
the first international standard for lmwh. antifiia activity was calibrated with serial dilutions (0±
1.0 iu/ml) of ufh (25 000 u/ml heparin1; nycomed pharma as, oslo, norway) in pooled
normal plasma.

results
mean body weight and body mass index were 81 kg
and 23.6 kg/m2 , respectively. all the participants
exhibited normal haemostasis assessed by the medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
screenings (see methods). all participants completed
the study according to the protocol and no adverse
events or bleeding complications were noted.
the pharmacokinetic pro®les and parameters on
the effect of  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin on  xxxg2266xxx  ac,
 xxxg2266xxx  ag, and anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities are
summarized in figures 1±4 and table 1. peak  xxxg2266xxx 
ac and  xxxg2266xxx  ag were detected after only 1 h,
whereas peak anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities were
detected after 2±6 h.
 xxxg2266xxx  activity and free antigen
the kinetic pro®les of  xxxg2266xxx  ac and  xxxg2266xxx  ag for
 xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin are shown in figures 1
and 2, respectively. increased values were seen 0.5 h
after the injections, whereas mean peak values were
achieved after 1.0±1.5 h. after 24 h,  xxxg2266xxx  ac and
 xxxg2266xxx  ag had returned to pretreatment levels. both
lmwhs increased peak  xxxg2266xxx  ac and  xxxg2266xxx  ag, and
auc for  xxxg2266xxx  ac and  xxxg2266xxx  ag, in a dosedependent manner (p , 0.001). no signi®cant dif-

statistics
all statistical analyses were performed using the
spss 8.0 statistical software package for windows
(spss inc, chicago, illinois, usa). the area under
the curves (auc) for  xxxg2266xxx  ac,  xxxg2266xxx  ag, and antifxa and anti-fiia activities were calculated using
graphpad prism 2.01 (graphpad software, san
diego, california, usa). descriptive statistics on
variables revealed a normal distribution of recorded
data. one-way analysis of variance was ®rst used to
identify signi®cant differences between the  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin regimens. due to the randomized,
cross-over design, statistical difference for the effect
of comparative doses of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx 
was then tested using the paired t test. ninety-®ve
per cent con®dence intervals were also calculated.
p , 0.05 was considered statistically signi®cant. all
values are given as mean and standard deviation
(sd), or mean and 95% con®dence intervals.

anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities
the kinetic pro®les of anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia
activities on  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin are shown in
figures 3 and 4, respectively. the dose±response
relationship was nearly linear for both  xxxd1805xxx 
and enoxaparin. peak levels were seen after 2.0±
6.0 h.
peak anti- xxxg741xxx  activities for different doses of
enoxaparin, i.e. 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, were signi®cantly higher than for comparative doses of  xxxd1805xxx , i.e. 50 u/kg (p , 0.001), 100 u/kg (p , 0.01),
and 200 u/kg (p  0.03), respectively (fig. 3). similarly, the auc for anti- xxxg741xxx  activity was signi®cantly (p , 0.01) higher for all the three doses of
enoxaparin as compared with  xxxd1805xxx  (table 1).
peak levels of anti-fiia activity showed no signi®cant differences between 50 and 100 u/kg  xxxd1805xxx 
compared with 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg enoxaparin, respectively (figure 4). however, 200 u/kg  xxxd1805xxx 
yielded higher maximal anti-fiia activity levels than

discussion
the purpose of the present experimental study was
to investigate the effect of two lmwhs with different anti- xxxg741xxx  and anti-fiia activities on the ability to
release endogenous  xxxg2266xxx . putative equivalent doses
of  xxxd1805xxx  (50, 100 and 200 u/kg) and enoxaparin
(0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg), given as a single s.c. injection, gave nearly similar release of endogenous
 xxxg2266xxx , but dissimilar effects on anti- xxxg741xxx  and antifiia activities. however,  xxxd1805xxx  seemed to
achieve both higher  xxxg2266xxx  ag and  xxxg2266xxx  ac when
related to anti- xxxg741xxx  activity. the distinction may be
explained by the fact that different lmwhs have
different average molecular sizes.  xxxd1805xxx  contains molecules ranging from 5000 to 7000 da [19],
whereas enoxaparin ranges from 4000 to 5000 da

in a randomized, cross-over design to six healthy volunteers.
values are mean and standard deviation. peak anti- xxxg741xxx  activities
after injection of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg enoxaparin were
signi®cantly higher than for comparative doses of 50 u/kg
(p , 0.001), 100 u/kg (p , 0.001), and 200 u/kg (p  0.03)
 xxxd1805xxx , respectively.  xxxd1805xxx : 50 u/kg (®lled square),
100 u/kg (®lled triangle), 200 u/kg (®lled circle); enoxaparin:
0.5 mg/kg (open square), 1.0 mg/kg (open triangle), and 2.0 mg/kg
(open circle).

[20]. thus,  xxxd1805xxx  covers both a wider spectrum
of heparin fragments but also a fraction of larger
molecules, which are not found in enoxaparin. this
explains why enoxaparin achieves the highest antifxa activity, whereas  xxxd1805xxx  has the highest
anti-fiia activity. the degree of sulphate groups
may also differ, which may also contribute to the
anticoagulant potential.
in the present study, maximal release of  xxxg2266xxx 
after injection of  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin was
observed within only 1 h, in contrast to peak levels
of anti-fiia and anti- xxxg741xxx  activities after 2±6 h.
similar discordant effects of both s.c. ufh and
lmwh on  xxxg2266xxx  and anti- xxxg741xxx  activity have also
been observed by other investigators [21,22], but
this is the ®rst report including a study of the dose±
response relationship of both  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin. in earlier studies,  xxxg2266xxx  ac was closely
related to anti- xxxg741xxx  activity, i.e. elimination of  xxxg2266xxx 
after injection of heparin [10], but the present study

(1 mg/kg enoxaparin and 100 u/kg  xxxd1805xxx ). however, comparative high-dose lmwh yielded signi®cantly higher anti-fiia
activity for  xxxd1805xxx  (200 u/kg) than for enoxaparin (2 mg/kg)
(p , 0.01).  xxxd1805xxx : 50 u/kg (®lled square), 100 u/kg (®lled

indicates that  xxxg2266xxx  is probably less closely related
to anti- xxxg741xxx  activity.
the rapid release of  xxxg2266xxx  after s.c. injected
heparins may involve rapid absorption of heparin
fragments without anti-fiia or anti- xxxg741xxx  activities,
but with retained ability to release  xxxg2266xxx . it could
also be an effect secondary to high binding af®nity

of heparin to  xxxg2266xxx , which ®ts with the low
concentration of heparin needed to release  xxxg2266xxx  in
cell culture studies [23]. alternatively, rapid release
of  xxxg2266xxx  could be mediated by other components
released or generated by the absorption of ufh and
lmwh.
in conclusion, this study indicates that putative
therapeutic equivalent doses of  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin induce rather similar releases of endogenous
 xxxg2266xxx , but dissimilar effects on anti- xxxg741xxx  and antifiia activities. assuming that release of  xxxg2266xxx  plays
an important role for the antithrombotic effects of
heparin, the present study suggests that different
lmwhs are less dissimilar than earlier anticipated
and suggested by the anti- xxxg741xxx /anti-fiia ratio. this
also supports the similar results of different
lmwhs obtained in clinical trials, although headto-head comparisons are still lacking.
