in view of evidence that neither interindividual nor induced intra-individual
variations of adrenergic receptor status are related to metabolic or haemodynamic sensitivity to adrenaline in vivo, we took an alternative approach to assessment of the relevance of adrenergic receptor measurement by measuring these
in a group of subjects with well-documented adrenergic denervation hypersensitivity, patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. mononuclear leukocyte p2adrenergic receptor densities (and binding affinities), measured with '2si-labelled
pinodolol, and  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation, in samples
from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( xxxg1193xxx ) with diabetic
autonomic neuropathy (n=8), were no different from those in samples from
patients with  xxxg1193xxx  without neuropathy (n=8), or from non-diabetic subjects
(n=8). in addition, platelet a,-adrenergic receptor densities (and binding
affinities), measured with 3h-labelled yohimbine, and adrenaline-induced
suppression of  xxxd1773xxx  contents did not differ among the three groups.
thus, in contrast to idiopathic autonomic failure, there is no generalized
increase in adrenergic receptors in autonomic failure due to diabetic autonomic
neuropathy. regardless of the mechanism of adrenergic denervation hypersensitivity in such patients, these data provide further evidence that measurements of cellular adrenergic receptors (and adenylate cyclase) in vitro are a
fallible index of sensitivity to catecholamines in vivo.

altered catecholamine-mediated or haemodynamic states can be the result of altered
release of catecholamines, altered sensitivity to
catecholamines, or both. measurements of
adrenergic receptors are ofteaused to attempt

to dissect the mechanisms of altered sensitivity.
for example, decreased adrenergic receptor
densities have been used to explain decreased
sensitivity to catecholamines in patients with
phaeochromocytomas [ 1-31, and increased

adrenergic receptor densities have been used to
explain adrenergic denervation hypersensitivity
to catecholamines in patients with idiopathic
autonomic failure [1,6-9).
measurements of adrenergic receptors on
readily accessible circulating cells (mononuclear
leukocytes and platelets) are frequently used to
infer adrenergic receptor status on relatively
inaccessible extravascular catecholamine target
tissues. this practice is supported by evidence
that adrenergic receptor density on circulating
cells does reflect that on several target tissues,
albeit in a subtype-specific fashion. for
example, mononuclear leukocyte (mnl) p2adrenergic receptor density has been found to
correlate with oz-adrenergic receptor densities
on myocardial [lo], lung 1111, skeletal muscle
[12], and myornetrial [13] membranes but not
with pi (?b3)-adrenergic receptor density on
adipocytes [ 121, al-adrenergic receptor density
on lung membranes 1111, o r a2-adrenergic
receptor density on platelets 1121. furthermore,
platelet a2-adrenergic receptor density has been
found to be unrelated to lung a,-adrenergic
receptor density [ l l ] or adipocyte o r skeletal
muscle f3-adrenergic receptor densities [ 121.
despite the appeal of adrenergic receptor
measurements, neither interindividual [ 121 nor
induced intra-individual [ 141 variations in
receptor densities, affinities or linked adenylate
cyclase activities have been found to correlate
with metabolic or haemodynamic sensitivity t o
catecholamines in vivo. for example, in 22
normal humans liggett et al., [i21 found no
relationships between adrenergic receptor
densities (on mnl, platelets, skeletal muscle
membranes or adipocytes) and sensitivity to
adrenaline in vivo. furthermore, the same
group [14] found no effect of triiodothyronine-

induced increments in p-adrenergic receptor
densities on sensitivity t o adrenaline in vivo;
this is documented on skeletal muscle membranes and adipocytes but probably occurs
also on myocardium [lo], lung [ll] and mnl
112, 151. these findings suggest either that
relatively small differences in tissue adrenergic
receptor densities d o not alter cellular sensitivity
to catecholamines, or that local or systemic
regulatory compensation occurs [ 12, 141. given
this lack of relationship between adrenergic
receptor status and sensitivity to catecholamines,
we decided to take an alternative approach to
assessment of the relevance of adrenergic
receptor measurements by measuring these in a
group of subjects with well-documented
adrenergic denervation
hypersensitivitypatients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy
1161.
materlals and methods
study population
sixteen patients with insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus ( xxxg1193xxx ) and eight healthy
subjects volunteered for the study after giving
informed consent. eight of the patients with
 xxxg1193xxx  had autonomic neuropathy, as assessed
by beat-to-beat variation in heart rate during
hyperventilation [17] and by the plasma noradrenaline response to standing, and eight
patients with  xxxg1193xxx  had no signs of neuropathy
(table i). the investigation was approved by
the local ethical committee. four of the
patients with neuropathy took diurectics for
hypertension; these were discontinued 24 h
prior to the smdy. none of the patients without
neuropathy took any drugs apart from insulin,
and the healthy subjects took no drugs at all.

protocol
the subjects met in the laboratory on two
occasions with an interval of up t o 4 months.
the experimental protocol was identical on these
two occasions. after an overnight fast and
tobacco abstention for at least 10 h, the subjects
met in the laboratory without having taken
their morning dose of insulin. a cannula was
inserted into a cubital vein and the subjects
subsequently rested supine on a couch. after 30
rnin of supine rest 200 ml of blood was drawn
for blood cell membrane adrenergic receptor
characterization on the first occasion, and an
identical volume of blood was drawn on the
second occasion for the determination of intact
blood cell cyclic a m p accumulation. subsequently, the subjects stood for 10 min. blood
samples (10 ml) were drawn for the determination of plasma catecholamines in the supine and
in the standing position, and heart rate and
blood pressure were registered.

previously [ 11, 12, 181. a2-adrenergic receptor
binding was performed using eight concentrations of ['hi-yohimbine
(0.5-25 nmol
i-'). membranes were incubated in triplicate
with ['hi-yohimbine in the absence (total binding) or presence (non-specific binding) of 10
nmol i-'  xxxd2914xxx . for  xxxd1773xxx  experiments, the effect of adrenaline o n inhibiting

incubatedwith lopmoll-' p g e l (sigma-p5515),
1.0 pmol i-' propranolol chloride (to block any

temperature. the incubation was terminated by
boiling for 5 min, and the aliquots were kept at
-20°c until measurement of camp.
adrenaline-induced inhibition of platelet
 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation was also performed
as described previously [12,14]. plasma catecholamines were measured by an enzymatic single
isotope derivative method [19]. cyclic a m p
was measured by radio-immunoassay [20].

a p-value (two-tailed) less than 0.05 was
considered significant.

results
plasma noradrenaline, blood pressure and heart
rate responses to standing
blood pressure decreased significantly in
response to standing in the patients with autonomic neuropathy, whereas no significant
changes were found in the patients without
neuropathy or in the healthy subjects (fig. 1).
heart rate increased significantly and similarly
in the three groups in response to standing.
supine resting plasma noradrenaline was significantly lower in the patients with autonomic
neuropathy compared with the other groups
(p<0.025), and the increment in plasma noradrenaline in response to standing was also
significantly smaller in the patients with autonomic neuropathy when compared with the
patients with neuropathy and the healthy subjects (fig. 1).

adrenergic receptors in diabetic neuropathy
adrenaline [16]. all of these are known to be
mediated through fi-adrenergic receptors in
patients with  xxxg1193xxx . despite this adrenergic
denervation hypersensitivity in vivo, the present
data show no increase in mnl p2-adrenergic
receptor density (or binding affinity) and no
increase in the function of these receptors, as
evidenced by  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated mnl
camp accumulation, in patients with diabetic
autonomic neuropathy. in addition, the data
show no differences in platelet a*-adrenergic
receptor-density (or binding affinity), and no
differences in adrenaline-mediated suppression
of platelet  xxxd1773xxx  content, in samples from
such patients. thus, these findings differ from
those in patients with idiopathic autonomic
failure in whom increased mnl p2-adrenergic
and platelet a2-adrenergic receptor densities
have been reported [ l , 6-91. however, they are
consistent with previous reports that platelet
a*-adrenergic receptor densities are not
increased in diabetic autonomic neuropathy
[22,23].
the present data do not categorically exclude
an increase in adrenergic receptors in extravascular catecholamine target tissues in patients
with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. indeed,
there is a preliminary report of increased padrenergic receptor densities on gluteal adipocytes from two affected patients [24]. as stated
earlier, the status of mnl p2-adrenergic receptors would not be expected to reflect that of
adipocyte p-adrenergic receptor [ 121 which are
of a different subtype. however, mnl b2adrenergic receptors would be expected to
reflect the status of that receptor subtype in
several tissues including myocardium [ 101, lung
[ l l ] , skeletal muscle [12] and myometrium [13].
thus, the data suggest that the mechanism of
adrenergic denervation hypersensitivity in
diabetic autonomic neuropathy [ 161 lies distal
to cellular transmembrane signalling, i.e. distal
to the adrenergic receptors and their linked
adenylate cyclases, and therefore at an intracellular site. alternatively, since the mean
residence-time of adrenaline is prolonged in
patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy
[25], altered adrenaline kinetics might explain,
or at least contribute to, the phenomenon.
regardless of the mechanism of adrenergic
denervation hypersensitivity in diabetic autonomic neuropathy, these data provide further
evidence that measurements of cellular adre-

665

nergic receptors (and adenylate cyclase) in vitro
are a fallible index of sensitivity to catecholamines in vivo. not only are interindividual [12]
and induced intra-individual [ 141 variations of
adrenergic receptor status unrelated to sensitivity to adrenaline in vivo, but adrenergic
receptors, at least those in circulating cells, are
unaltered in a group of patients with increased
metabolic and haemodynamic sensitivity to the
hormone in vivo.
