abstract: the processed products of the  xxxg1801xxx  gene (acth, -msh, -msh, -msh, etc.) interact with five
melanocortin receptors, the mc1r,  xxxg1385xxx , mc3r, mc4r, and mc5r to modulate and control many important biological functions
crucial for good health both peripherally (as hormones) and centrally (as neurotransmitters). pivotal biological functions include
pigmentation, adrenal function, response to stress, fear/flight, energy homeostasis, feeding behavior, sexual function and motivation,
pain, immune response, and many others, and are believed to be involved in many disease states including pigmentary disorders, adrenal
disorders, obesity, anorexia, prolonged and neuropathic pain, inflammatory response, etc. the melanocortin-3 receptor (mc3r) is found
primarily in the brain and spinal cord and also in the periphery, and its biological functions are still not well understood. here we review
some of the biological functions attributed to the mc3r, and then examine in more detail efforts to design and synthesize ligands that are
potent and selective for the mc3r, which might help resolve the many questions still remaining about its function. though some
progress has been made, there is still much to be done in this critical area.

introduction
the five melanocortin receptors and their corresponding agonist
ligands which are derived from the precursor protein  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) and the endogenous antagonist protein
ligands agouti and agouti related protein (agrp) have been the
subject of scientific investigation for over 100 years, primarily for
their function in melanopigmentation and adrenal function [1-4]
and disorders related to pigmentation, stress and melanoma cancer.
more recently, however, interest in both the melanotropin ligands
and melanocortin receptors has greatly accelerated due to the
cloning of the receptors in the 1990s, and the discovery of a number
of important functions for the ligands and their receptors in a wide
variety of biological activities including feeding behavior, obesity,
anorexia, cachexia, sexual function and motivation, pain, immune
response, cardiovascular function and many others [5,6]. and new
discoveries of the involvement of this system in an ever wider
variety of biological activities and behaviors including many
diseases of the periphery and the central nervous system (cns) are
being made.
the major focus of this paper is on the melanocortin-3 system.
the melanocortin-3 receptor (mc3r) is located on pomc neurons
in the cns, especially in the arcuate nucleus and within other areas
of the brain [7] including the hypothalamus, and in several
peripheral organs as well. it often is co-localized with the mc4r,
but its precise function in obesity, cachexia, and related feeding
behaviors is still not well understood. initially (while still an orphan
receptor) the mc3r was linked to non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus on human chromosome 20q which we now know is the
mc3r [8,9], and there is some evidence that the mc3r is an
inhibitory autoreceptor on pomc neurons including the stimulation
of food intake by peripheral administration of an mc3r specific
agonist [10], and inhibition of spontaneous action of pomc
neurons after application of a mc3r agonist [11]. interestingly and
paradoxically in the mc3r knockout mice an obesity syndrome is
observed with reduced lean body mass and increased fat mass for
both sexes, and with no apparent hyperphagia and with apparent
normal energy expenditure [12,13,14]. interestingly the mc3r
knockout mice appear to be resistant to high fat diet-induced insulin
resistance [14]. these and other findings suggest that development
of peptide and non-peptide ligands that are selective for the mc3r
may herald the arrival of exciting new classes of drugs for the
treatment of a variety of disease states that involve melanotropin

peptides and melanocortin receptors. in addition they can serve as
valuable ligands for sorting out the detailed mechanism(s) of action
of these ligands and their receptors which are poorly understood.
the melanocortin-3 receptor (mc3r) – overall
considerations
the mc3r is expressed in the central nervous system,
peripheral tissues and immune cells, with initial studies highlighting
expression in brain, gut, and placenta but none were detected in the
adrenal gland or melanocytes [15]. this lack of expression in the
adrenal glands is not surprising given the fact that msh peptides do
not increase circulating corticosterone levels, through activation of
the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (hpa) [16]. as already
discussed, a potential role in energy metabolism has been
postulated for the mc3r since in mc3r null mice there is an
increased fat mass and higher ratio of weight gain to food intake
[13]. other studies have demonstrated a central role in modulating
the host inflammatory response with receptor detection on
peritoneal [16-18] and knee joint macrophages [19]. activation of
mc3r in the heart has been shown to exhibit a protective effect in
ischaemic-reperfusion injury [20,21]. thus the mc3r can be
viewed as a fine tuner of specific mechanisms operating during
inflammation, cardiovascular function and energy metabolism.
in the central nervous system, the melanocortin type 3 receptor
(mc3r) is located on pomc neurons and other areas of the
hypothalamus and often is co-localized with the melanocortin type
4 receptor (mc4r). the mc4r which regulates food intake is
activated and modulated by the endogenous agonist, -melanocyte
stimulating hormone (-msh), a peptide processed from pomc,
and also is modulated by an endogenous antagonist, agouti-related
protein (agrp) (orexigenic) [22]. leptin, an adipocyte-derived
hormone, acts on pomc and agrp neurons in the arcuate nucleus
of the hypothalamus, resulting in increased -msh and decreased
agrp [23]. several lines of evidence have indicated that activation
of the mc4r by -msh or synthetic peptide agonists reduces food
intake, but that suppression of mc4r signaling by agrp or
synthetic melanocortin-4 receptor antagonists increases food intake
and diminishes the hypophagic response to leptin [24,25]. thus, the
central melanocortin pathway is extremely important for normal
energy homeostasis, and energy homeostasis via this pathway is
highly susceptible to quantitative variations in mc3r/mc4r
expression.
melanocortin receptors belong to the superfamily of seven
transmembrane g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). the hmcrs
transduce signals by coupling to the heterotrimeric gs protein and
subsequent activation of adenylate cyclase. in many gpcrs,

signaling is rapidly attenuated within minutes of agonist exposure, a
process termed desensitization [26,27]. this process is associated
with phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in the third
internal loop or carboxyl tail of the gpcr by g protein-coupled
receptor kinases (grks) or second-messenger-dependent kinases
[28]. there is no direct evidence for the hmc3r phosphorylation
site yet. phosphorylation by grks allows the gpcrs to interact
with cytoplasmic proteins, the arrestins, which uncouple the gpcrs
from g proteins [28,29]. for the hmcrs, arrestins target the
receptor to clathrin-coated vesicles, and the receptor is sequestered
into an intracellular vesicular compartment, probably endosomes,
after pinching off the vesicles from the plasma membrane by
dynamin [30]. after sequestration, the gpcrs may recycle to the
surface membrane after resensitization [31,32] or undergo
lysosomal degradation [33]. certain gpcrs can be targeted
selectively to lysosomes leading to down-regulation of the gpcr
by the same membrane pathway that mediates internalization [33].
down-regulation of gpcrs in various neural cell types is of
particular interest because this may lead to certain diseases, such as
addiction [34], and opiate tolerance and dependence [35]. more
generally any down-regulation/desensitization, which occurs for
gpcrs in response to agonists, leads to a decrease in drug efficacy.
despite the central importance of the mc3r/mc4r in energy
homeostasis, feeding behavior and the existence of an endogenous
agonist and antagonist of the melanocortin system, highly selective
mc3r agonists and antagonists, which could have important
applications in treatment of cachexia and type ii diabetes, and in
evaluating the role of the mc3r in these conditions, are not yet
available. design of selective mc3r/mc4r agonists and
antagonists thus becomes of critical importance. our research group
has been working on the design and synthesis of selective
melanotropins for many years. describing in a single review all
existing approaches that have been taken to obtain ligands that
target human melanocortin receptors (hmcrs) is not possible.
rather we will examine a few different approaches investigators
have taken for design of selective ligands for the mc3r which
reflect the current knowledge. we hope this will address the
fundamental and the methodological issues which can promote
rational design of more selective hmcr ligands. in this regard,
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hmcrs
function is also important in the design of ligands with the desired
pharmacological profile. knowledge of the current biostructural
data is also important since it is becoming increasingly clear that
stereostructural differences between the closely related receptors,
such as the mc3r in relation to the mc1r, mc4r and mc5r, will
be an important aspect of any successful development of a selective
ligand for biological and biomedical applications [36].
general considerations for the design of
hmc3r selective agonists and antagonists
although numerous native peptides have great potential for
medical applications, and over 50% of all current drugs are peptide
or peptidomimetic-based, often peptides have to be modified to
enhance certain properties including metabolic stability, selectivity,
and bioavailability, to be suitable therapeutic agents. thus design of
modified peptides for peptidomimetic and non-peptide applications
has dramatically advanced during the last two decades [e.g. 37-42].
one of the most challenging aspects of this research is rational
design based on 3d-topographical features of the peptide
pharmacophore. the first strategy in this approach is to identify the
core structural features which are necessary for receptor/acceptor
recognition. this is usually accomplished by truncation of the
whole sequence; systematic single amino acid modifications of the
peptide such as glycine, alanine, d-amino acid, etc. scans; ring size
scans, bulky amino acid scans, etc. [e.g. 41,43]. once the structure
activity relationships (sar) of the peptide ligand have been
elucidated, the conformation-activity relationships have to be
examined. for this purpose, a wide variety of physical/chemical

hruby et al.

methods are employed. for example, the three-dimensional
arrangement of critical side chain groups and backbone
conformations can be analyzed via nmr spectroscopy [44,45], xray crystallography [46], circular dichroism measurements [47], and
computational methods [48]. the next step is to find a suitable nonpeptide scaffold which can impart the same 3d topographic
structural features as the peptide based on conformational analysis,
computational chemistry and 3d modeling. the derived scaffold
then can be used to replace the peptide drug pharmacophore and
position the crucial structural elements correctly in 3d space.
finally, the structure can be refined by evaluating the biological
responses of designed ligands. the general scheme for the de novo
design of peptide drugs has been outlined in a recent review [41].
understanding the conformation-activity relationships of biologically active peptides can provide important guidance in the design
of peptide drugs and accelerate the process from native peptides to
biologically active peptide drug or to peptidomimetics and small
molecules.
structure-activity relationships of linear
msh-derived peptides
the endogenous mc3r agonist: -msh h-tyr-val-met-glyhis-phe-arg-trp-asp-arg-phe-gly-oh [49] was discovered by
homologous screening of the various core sequences of pomc that
contain the critical tetrapeptide sequence -his-phe-arg-trp- [5051]. biological screening demonstrated that -msh was selective
for the hmc3r by up to 100 fold, compared to -msh [49]. grieco
et al. used a d-amino acid scan of the -msh sequence to obtain
the first highly selective agonist for the hmc3r (h-tyr-val-metgly-his-phe-arg- xxxd1794xxx -asp-arg-phe-gly-oh; ec50 = 0.33 nm;
hmc4r/hmc3r = 300, hmc5r/hmc3r = 250) [43]. furthermore,
replacement of the oxidizable met3 residue with nle increased the
stability of the peptide [52], which is being widely used as a ligand
for the hmc3r in a variety of ongoing pharmacological studies and
in animal model studies related to the hmc3r. interestingly, when
the phe6 residue of -msh was substituted with d-nal(2’), a
substitution known to convert -msh analogues to antagonists at
the hmc3r and hmc4r [53], the resulting analogue (h-tyr-valnle-gly-his-d-nal(2’)-arg-trp-asp-arg-phe-gly-nh2) exhibited
potent hmc3r/hmc5r antagonist activity, while retaining potent
full agonist activity at the hmc4r [54].
hybridization of -msh with -msh [52] proved to be an
effective approach toward the design of selective hmc3r ligands,
yielding a potent hmc3r selective antagonist (h-tyr-val-nle-glyhis- xxxd1793xxx -arg-d-nal(2’)-asp-arg-phe-gly-nh2; ic50 = 6 nm),
which also showed potent agonist activities at the hmc1r, hmc4r
and hmc5r (table 1).
global and local conformational constraints in the design of hmc3r selective
peptides
the conversion of the linear -msh into a cyclic peptide to
enhance potency, metabolic stability, and to test hypotheses
regarding a -turn structure for the bioactive conformation of
melanotropin ligands was an early innovation in the development of
approaches to peptide ligand design. in the case -msh and its
fragment analogues, the cys4,cys10(cys11) analogues were
examined over 25 years ago [55,56] and this evolved using computational methods, molecular dynamic simulations, conformational
analysis via nmr and molecular modeling to the development of
cyclic lactam analogues of -msh such as the truncated analogue
ac-nle4-c[asp5,d-phe7,lys10]-msh(4-10)-nh2 (mtii) [57,58]
which is used worldwide for the study of melanocortin 1, 3, 4 and 5
receptors for both in vitro and in vivo studies because of its high
potency, metabolic stability, and excellent biodistribution properties
[59]. more recently we have examined a number of other
cyclization strategies to obtain melanocortin receptor selective

ligands. as an earlier effort to develop highly selective and potent
agonists and/or antagonists for the hmc receptors, a new group of
linker arms and a backbone to side chain cyclization strategy were
employed (fig. 1). a key analogue was found to have the desired
selectivity and potency at the hmc3 receptors which were
implicated to play pivotal roles in energy homeostasis and other
biological effects in this study. structure-activity studies [60] have
shown that replacing the succinyl linker arm of 1 by an o-phthalic
acid group and substituting a d-nal(2')7 residue in place of d-phe7
results in a potent antagonist 7 (fig. 1) at the hmc4 receptor.
furthermore, increasing the 23-membered lactam ring of 1 by one
carbon atom (succinic
glutaric acid linker) gives a highly
selective and potent antagonist 9 for the hmc3 receptor (fig. 1).
this cyclization strategy showed that a 23 membered ring is
favored for maintaining good binding at all subtypes of melano-

cortin receptors [60]. increasing the ring size or introducing an
aromatic linker are likely to lead to more selective melanotropins.
thus, the selective mc3r antagonist: c[(o)c-(ch2)3-c(o)-his-dnal(2’)-arg-trp-lys)]-nh2 showed good biological activity as an
antagonist with a pa2 = 10.6 and ic50 = 5.6 nm (24 membered ring,
(hmc4r/hmc3r = 38)) [60].
in another approach, the template of shu-9119, ac-nle4c[asp5-his6-d-nal(2')7-arg8-trp9-lys10]-nh2), a potent but nonselective hmc3r/hmc4r antagonist [53] was modified in position
6 with nonconventional amino acids (fig. 2) [61]. the biological
results of this series of compounds clearly indicate that a
conformational restriction with bulky amino acids in position 6 in a
cyclic peptide can be used to obtain selective antagonists for the
hmc3r and the hmc4r (pa2 = 9.1-9.8) [61]. furthermore,

fig. (1). key analogues of 1, peptide 7 synthesized by introducing an o-phthalic acid in the cyclization linker of 1; peptide 9 synthesized by replacing d-phe7

(xaa = aromatic amino acid) resulted in improved hmc4r/hmc3r
selectivities, notably yielding a highly hmc3r-selective partial
agonist pg-951 (h-d-phe4-c[asp5-his6-d-phe7-arg8-trp9-lys10]nh2, ic50 = 3.7 nm, ec50 = 4.87 nm, 61% camp stimulation)
(table 1) [62].
disulfide cyclization of the native -msh around the
pharmacophore sequence his-phe-arg-trp provided no further
leads toward the enhancement of hmc3r selectivity [54]. on the

other hand, such cyclization in the -msh/-msh hybrid series
yielded potent and highly selective hmc3r antagonists ac-c[cysglu-pro-d-nal(2)-arg-trp-cys]-pro-pro-lys-asp-nh2 and acc[pen-glu-his-d-nal(2)-arg-trp-cys]-pro-pro-lys-asp-nh2
(ic50 = 31 and 3 nm, respectively) (table 1) [63].
introduction of the -constrained phenylproline analogues into
the his6 position of the  xxxg1470xxx  template resulted in topographical
changes that lead to increased hmc5r selectivity, which indicated

design, synthesis and biological evaluation of ligands selective

that hmc3 and hmc4 receptors are more sensitive to steric effects
and -conformational constraints than the hmc5 receptor [64].
another example of using -constrained amino acids that lead to
selective partial agonists and antagonists at the hmc3r was
obtained by introducing (o-phe)-phe at the  xxxd1793xxx  position of mtii, yielding a selective partial antagonist of the mc3r (ac-nlec[asp-his-(o-phe)phe-arg-trp-lys]-nh2) [65]. this is a typical
example showing that introducing an alkyl or aryl group on the
aromatic ring of an aromatic amino acid residue, particularly in the
ortho position can significantly restrict its conformation in 2 space.
the 2 torsional angle can be efficiently restricted by the interaction
between the aryl moiety and the -hydrogens of the amino sidechain in the o-substituted phenylalanine and finally increase the
selectivity of melanocortin receptors.
using nmr based modeling and computational
methods for melanocortin receptor selective ligands
computational methods in conjunction with nmr structural
determination and molecular modeling are a very useful tool in
peptide and peptidomimetic design considerations, with the caveat
that for novel structures, current force fields might not give a
completely accurate picture of the structure or energetics of the
ligands. along with the nmr structure of agrp (the endogenous
antagonist of melanotropin) (pdb: 1hyk) [66] and mtii (potent
agonist) [67], the 3d pharmacophore of human melanocortin
receptor ligands has been partially deciphered. results from these
biophysical and chemical studies can be crucial for designing novel
selective agonist and antagonist melanotropins [52].
recent conformation-activity relationship studies also have
yielded some important structural clues for development of
hmc3r-selective ligands. thus, ying et al. [67] determined that
solution structures of the non-selective agonist  xxxg1470xxx , hmc3r/
hmc4r antagonist shu9119, hmc4r-selective agonist vjh085
and hmc3r-selective antagonist mk-9 all feature -turn-like
motifs spanning the his6 and  xxxd1793xxx /d-nal(2’)7 residues. this
structural feature was hypothesized to be very important for
receptor-ligand recognition and interaction. grieco et al. had found
that replacement of the his6 residue in shu9119 template with a
variety of conformationally constrained amino acids leads to

fig. (3). design of the -msh-derived cyclic lactam scaffold [69].

substantially improved receptor selectivity (table 1) [61, 68]. on
the basis of these results, grieco et al. suggested that the improvement in receptor selectivity was due to differences between the
hmc3r and hmc4r binding pockets, which are able to accommodate amino acid residues with different conformational profiles.
recently, our laboratories have produced several potent and
selective hmc3r agonists and hmc3r/hmc5r antagonists by
placing a bulky hydrophobic nle residue next to the melanocortin
pharmacophore xaa-phe-arg-trp in a cyclic -msh-derived
template (fig. 3] [69]. the observed hmc3r selectivity was
attributed to steric interference between the nle4 side chain and the
arg7 binding space, based on mcmm-lmcs/opls-aa simulations, as well as relatively high rigidity of the 20-membered cyclic
lactam template. similar results were obtained when nle was
placed within the melanocortin pharmacophore, in position 6 of a
cyclic -msh template, yielding an hmc3r antagonist cyclo
(510)-(succinyl5-nle6-d-phe7-arg8-trp9-lys10)-nh2 (ic50 =
84 nm) and an hmc3r/hmc5r antagonist cyclo(510)(succinyl5-nle6-d-nal(2’)7-arg8-trp9-lys10)-nh2 (ic50 = 12 and
17 nm, respectively; pa2 = 8.3 (hmc3r) and 8.7 (hmc5r)) [70]
these findings underscore the significance of steric factors in
melanocortin receptor selectivity, and suggest that introduction of
bulky residues in the direct proximity to the melanocortin
pharmacophore is an effective approach to design of novel hmc3rselective agonists and antagonists. congruent findings were
reported by ballet et al. for the  xxxg1470xxx /shu9119 cyclic lactam
template, where the his6-xaa7 residues were replaced with the 4amino-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-2-benzazepin-3-one-xaa (aba-xaa) building blocks (fig. 4) [71] resulting in a highly hmc3r selective
antagonist aba-2 (ac-nle4-c[asp5-aba6-d-phe7-arg8-trp9-lys10)nh2, ic50 = 50 nm) and a hmc3r/hmc5r antagonist aba-4 (acnle4-c[asp5-aba6-d-nal(2’)7-arg8-trp9-lys10)-nh2, ic50 = 43 and
87 nm, respectively) (table 1). the authors hypothesized that the
observed hmc3r receptor selectivity may be caused by either steric
influence of the aba block or its unique conformational features, or,
possibly, both.
deletion of his6 from the sequence of cyclic -msh analogues,

trp9-lys10)-nh2). it was suggested that the tripeptide core dnal(2’)-arg-trp was sufficient for high binding affinity toward the
hmc4r, whereas the tetrapeptide core his-d-nal(2’)-arg-trp is
required for high binding affinity toward the hmc3r and hmc5r.
contrary to this hypothesis, our recent results [70] suggest that the
tripeptide sequence  xxxd1793xxx /d-nal(2’)-arg-trp is sufficient for high
binding affinity and agonist activity not only at the hmc4r but also
at the hmc3r, as exemplified by cyclic peptides avm75,
cyclo(610)-(2,3-pyrazinedicarbonyl6-d-phe7-arg8-trp9-lys10)nh2, and avm76, cyclo(610)-(2,3-pyrazinedicarbonyl6-dnal(2’)7-arg8-trp9-lys10)-nh2, which exhibit a potent and
selective partial agonist (ec50 = 27 nm, 70% camp stimulation)
and antagonist (ic50 = 23 nm) activities at the hmc3r, respectively
(fig. 5). these findings strongly suggest that the observed high
receptor selectivities in ‘tripeptide-pharmacophore’ analogues are
due to different conformational and steric properties of the linker
arm, rather than different pharmacophore sequence requirements of
the melanocortin receptor subtypes. thus, manipulation of the
linker structure is proving to be a powerful tool in the development
of highly selective melanotropin peptides.

development
of
hmc3r-selective
small
molecule ligands
though many commercial pharmaceutical companies have been
examining small molecules that can bind to the melanocortin
receptors, surprisingly few of these ligands appear to have high
potency and selectivity for the mc3r. it is worth noting that a
number of publications of small-molecule research report little or
no data for the mc3r.
one of the most popular strategies to emerge in the pursuit of
small-molecule ligands for the melanocortin receptors has been the
use of so-called “privileged structure” motifs, presumably biased
towards gpcr activity, in combination with a d-tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxyl (tic)-d-para-chloro(p-cl)-phenylalanine
(phe) dipeptide consensus sequence. a series of heterocyclesubstituted cyclohexylpiperidine structures emerged from this work
[73]. interestingly, analogue 1 (fig. 6) with l(s) stereochemistry at
the pcl-phe asymmetric center, has the highest affinity for the
mc3r. significant activation of the mc3r occurs only with the
more common d-tic-d-pcl-phe dipeptide, found to be optimal for

side-chain functionality found in the key residues of bioactive
peptide ligands [79].
a logical alternative approach to creating small molecule
ligands for these receptors, then, is the use of the experimentallyderived structures of known active ligands to rationally design new
molecules. in the first report of work employing this strategy [80],
the solution structure of an active cyclic peptide ligand related to
 xxxg1470xxx  was first determined using nmr-derived constraints. models
of a variety of ring systems appended with the appropriate side
chain functionality were overlapped with the peptide nmr
structure, and compounds demonstrating the best overlap were
synthesized. this study seems to indicate that in some compounds,
changing or removing any of the pharmacophore elements will
cause the complete loss of mc3r activity (fig. 10). generally, it
illustrates the potential to generate active compounds by a ligandbased design approach.
our own rational design of small molecules for the melanocortin receptors relied on a similar approach [81]. instrumental to
achieving this goal was the determination of an nmr solution
structure for  xxxg1470xxx  [67], against which potential new structures
could be superimposed. modeling indicated that our amino acidderived scaffold could mimic the -turn backbone of the peptide,
and facilitated the prediction of which positional and stereochemical isomers were most likely to be active. all members of a test
set of eight compounds were found to be high-affinity antagonists,

mc4r activity. the most potent ligand (2) is a partial agonist with
an n-methyl substitution to the heterocycle within the privileged
structure portion of the molecule.
a number of other putatively gpcr-biased privileged structures have been appended to the d-tic-d-pcl-phe sequence. three
examples of substituted arylpiperazines are shown in fig. 7, but
their affinities for the hmc3r are in the micromolar range [74-76].
compounds with modifications to both the privileged structure
and the dipeptide consensus sequence have been reported. two
examples are shown in fig. 8 [77]. interestingly, in this series only
the analogue n-methylated at the  nitrogen of the imidazole shows
no activity at the mc3r. this substitution is likely to change the
orientation and hydrogen-bonding properties of this heterocycle,
and illustrates the importance of the histidine or histidinemimicking side chain in mc3r binding and activation.
the compounds in fig. 9 provide further support for this
assertion [78]. varying the position of n-methylation in the hismimicking piperazine produces the only analogue which significantly activates the mc3r.
clearly the privileged structure approach has had a major
impact on research efforts aimed at developing melanocortintargeted small molecules. molecular modeling provides a rationale
for the activity of this molecular template, as the pharmacophore
elements found in the small molecules appear to overlap with the

and most subtype-selective. in this series, there appears to be a
significant similarity in the binding requirements for the mc1r and
mc3r, as typified by the nanomolar binding of 13 to both subtypes
(fig. 11). demonstrating the crucial nature of the stereochemistry
of these ligands, inversion of the c6 center to produce the
diastereomeric 12 yields complete mc5r selectivity. this work
further demonstrates that a ligand-based rational design approach
may be a highly efficient means of producing hmc3r-active
molecules.

more traditional approaches, such as the optimization of
activity for a compound series originally derived from a screening
hit, have also led to the discovery of novel ligands for the mcrs.
an example of a pyridazinone-based molecule [82] derived in this
way is shown in fig. (12).

similarity searches are among the most diverse and most useful,
and have become a standard tool for target specific library design
[83, 84]. the underlying theory is that, given a compound with
desired biological activities, compounds that are similar to it in
structure are likely to have similar activity. in a common practice of
focused library design, the investigator provides a set of chemical
structures as a “probe” for searches of a database of compounds,
and finds those that are most similar, and then submits them for
testing. similarity searches can be done on the basis of either 2d or
3d structure. 2d similarity searches are computationally very
inexpensive and rapid; their popularity is related to the trend of
applying high-throughput medicinal chemistry methodologies.
successful approaches to the design of focused compound
libraries have recently been reported for the melanocortin 4 receptor
and other gpcrs [73, 85-88]. they range from 2d simulation
algorithms, to the analysis of ligand-receptor spatial arrangements
and to neural network learning qsar systems. with this variety of
tools, it now appears possible to design libraries that are enriched in
compounds possessing the desired target-specific properties.
the hmc3r structure and related aspects of
ligand-receptor interaction
comparison of the human melanocortin receptor sequences
revealed that most of the conserved amino acids are located within
the putative transmembrane helices, with the most sequence
deviations occurring within the c-terminus, first extracellular and
third intracellular loops, whereas the other extra- and intracellular
loops as well as the amino-terminus show regions of substantial
similarity [89].
chen et al. examined the significance of 19 transmembrane
domain amino acids for molecular recognition and receptor
signaling (fig. 13) [90]. the hmc3r residues e131,  xxxd154xxx ,  xxxd158xxx ,
and h298 were found to be homologous to the hmc1r residues
e94,  xxxd117xxx ,  xxxd121xxx , and h260, and to the hmc4r residues e100,

 xxxd122xxx ,  xxxd126xxx , and h264, respectively [91-93]. the existence of an
ionic pocket formed by amino acid residues e131in transmembrane
domain 2 [tm2) and  xxxd154xxx ,  xxxd158xxx  in  xxxg2318xxx  of hmc3r and a second
hydrophobic binding pocket consisting of f295, f296, and h298 in
tm6 of hmc3r was hypothesized, as replacement of these amino
acids with alanine resulted in dramatically reduced ndp--msh
binding affinity and agonist potency (fig. 14). furthermore,
substitutions of  xxxd121xxx  in tm2 and  xxxd332xxx  in tm7 with alanine
resulted in the complete loss of ligand binding, ligand induced
receptor activation, and cell surface protein expression. these
findings suggest that  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 are important for ndp--msh
binding, while  xxxd121xxx  in tm2 and  xxxd332xxx  in tm7 are crucial for
receptor signaling. interestingly, unlike mc1r and mc4r, only
tm6 of hmc3r seems to be involved in a hydrophobic binding
pocket, as mutations of f216a, f233a, f234a, f288a, f290a,
and f318a did not significantly alter ndp--msh binding affinity
and receptor activity. tao and segaloff also described the hmc3r
mutation i183n, found in patients with high fat contents, which
completely abolishes agonist-mediated receptor activation [93].
potential therapeutic uses for the mc3r
until the discovery and cloning of the mc3r, mc4r and
mc5r receptors in the 1990s most of the work with pomc related
peptides (-endorphin not included) centered around the possible
roles of -msh in pigmentation, pigmentary disorder, and
melanoma cancer, and the role(s) of acth in adrenal function.
though much critical research still is ongoing in these areas, since
then a large number of academic, pharmaceutical and biotechnology groups have been examining the role(s) primarily of -msh
and related peptides, peptidomimetics and non-peptide ligands on
the mc3r, mc4r and mc5r. it is not our intention here to review
this rapidly expanding literature (see e.g. refs. [5, 6] for examples of
many areas under investigation). in this review we will concentrate
on those aspects related to the mc3r.
in the last 15 years, major advances in our understanding of the
regulation of body weight and energy homeostasis have been
reported [59, 94]. it is now widely understood that the disorders of
leptin feedback or hypothalamic melanocortin signaling can lead to
pathological weight gain and diabetes in humans [e.g. 95, 96].
downstream of leptin signaling, the interplay between melanocortin
peptides and  xxxg1590xxx  (npy) has been examined [e.g. 97]
and it has been demonstrated that melanocortin peptide administration within the pvh leads to the regulation of feeding behavior
as well as energy expenditure. the central melanocortin system
modulates energy homeostasis through the actions of the agonist msh, a pomc cleavage product, and the endogenous antagonist
agrp on the mc3r and mc4r [98,99]. the mc3r is primarily
expressed in the brain in the regions of the hypothalamus and
limbic system, as well as in the placenta and gut [100,101]. on the

model illustrating the synthetic melanocortin ndp--msh docked inside
the hmc3r. two receptor binding pockets are hypothesized, the first being
a predominantly ionic pocket formed by  xxxd154xxx  and  xxxd158xxx , and the second is
a hydrophobic pocket formed by aromatic residues in tm6 [90].

other hand, mc4r is widely expressed throughout the brain
[15,102]. additionally, the control of food intake has been suggested to be modulated through the mc4r [103], whereas the mc3r
and mc5r have not been linked to any specific actions on feeding
behavior. several investigators [12,13,104] have attempted to solve

this puzzle by studying mc3r-deficient mice and to comparing
these mice with mice deficient for both the mc3r and mc4r
genes. it was suggested that inactivation of the mouse mc3r leads
to increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and higher feed efficiency
than their wild type littermates. furthermore, mc3r-/- mice also
exhibited a unique metabolic syndrome leading to 50% increase in
adipose mass, an unusual increase in respiratory quotient and
reduced energy expenditure [13].
the role of mc3r also has been proposed for anti-inflammation as well as cardiovascular regulation. getting et al. [105]
have suggested that activation of mc3r by acth(4-10)
suppresses cytokine release from microphages which then leads to
the inhibition of inflammation. furthermore, the mc3r is the only
melanocortin receptor subtype for which 2-msh is selective [106]
which makes this receptor an obvious leading candidate for
mediation of cardiovascular regulation [107,108] and inhibition of
trh release [109]. recently, marks et al. [110] have shown that
peripheral injections of d-trp8--msh, a potent and selective
mc3r agonist can stimulate food intake in mice which suggests
that individuals affected with involuntary weight loss due to chronic
diseases can be helped [111]. this is the first time such a
physiological role for mc3r has been suggested where this
receptor acts as an inhibitory autoreceptor of pomc neurons. table
1 describes a number of potent and selective mc3r agonists and
antagonists that might prove useful for the treatment of obesity,
cachexia and cardiovascular, inflammatory, and other diseases.
concluding remarks
pomc is clearly a primordial gene whose presence is found in
virtually all multicellular animals that have a central nervous
system. from this perspective it perhaps is not surprising that the
processed ligands from this gene and their target g-protein coupled
receptor are involved in most aspects of human behavior, endocrine
and central nervous system function. though -msh, acth and

design, synthesis and biological evaluation of ligands selective

some of the other processed peptides of pomc, especially from the
pituitary gland, were among the first peptide hormones/
neurotransmitters whose biological functions were evaluated in
considerable detail at least with respect to melanopigmentary and
adrenal function, it was the cloning of the receptors for these
functions [i.e. mc1r and  xxxg1385xxx ) and the additional three receptors
(i.e. mc3r, mc4r, mc5r) that led to recognition of the central
role of this system of ligands and receptors in numerous endocrine
and cns functions in normal health and disease. though much of
this research has focused on the mc4r and feeding behavior it has
become increasingly clear that the mc3r is often as crucial as the
mc4r in a variety of biological functions, and it seems clear that
future research will have to evaluate the mc3r receptor system in
much more detail, especially its relationships in various physiological and pharmacological situations where they and other
neurotransmitter and hormonal systems are involved in health and
disease. clearly highly potent and selective ligands, both agonists
and antagonists, will be needed to sort out the complex biology
involved. though we have developed some reasonably selective
hmc3r ligands, there is clearly a great need for further development, and we plan to pursue this vigorously into the future.
