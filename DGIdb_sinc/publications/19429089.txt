the neuronal vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2) is the target molecule of action of some psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine and 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma). the
present study examined the effect of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssris), on vmat2 activity by measuring  xxxd83xxx -dependent [3 h]dopamine uptake into
synaptic vesicles prepared from rat striatum. ssris, ﬂuoxetine, paroxetine, and ﬂuvoxamine, inhibited
vesicular [3 h]dopamine uptake in vitro. the rank order of potency was reserpine  ﬂuoxetine, paroxetine > ﬂuvoxamine, methamphetamine > mdma. moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition by
reserpine, a typical vmat2 inhibitor, was uncompetitive, decreasing maximum velocity and afﬁnity
for dopamine. inhibition by ﬂuoxetine was noncompetitive, only decreasing maximum velocity for
dopamine. these results suggest that ﬂuoxetine inhibited the activity of vmat2 by a mechanism different
from that of reserpine and did not directly interact with the active site of vmat2.

the neuronal synaptic vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2)
is exclusively located in the membrane of presynaptic vesicles
of monoaminergic neurons in the brain [13]. vmat2 transports
monoamine neurotransmitters from the cytoplasm to their storage vesicles, regulates their subsequent release in the central
nervous system [16], and is responsible for packaging dopamine,
norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine in the neuronal cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles [12]. vmat2 is the site of action of
some psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine and its substituted derivative 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma),
inducing dopamine efﬂux from vesicles in neuronal terminals
and producing hyperactivity and particularly neurotoxicity of
monoaminergic neurons [24,27]. a recent study in mutant mice
lacking the vmat2 gene showed that vmat2 heterozygous mice
display a depressive-like phenotype that is devoid of anxiety-like
behavior [9]. elevated levels of vmat2 have been reported in the
brains of bipolar disorder patients [28] and vmat2 density (bmax ) in
the platelets of untreated patients with major depressive disorder
compared with healthy control subjects [29].

crowley et al. [4] reported that polymorphisms in vmat2
(leu117pro and ser505pro) in mice might be functional and explain
the animals’ differential responses to ssris. these ﬁndings suggest
that altered vmat2 function may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. although ssris are reported to inhibit
other ion channels (e.g.,  xxxg1256xxx  [15,17]), little is known about the
effect of antidepressant drugs, especially ssris, on vmat2 activity.
the present study examined the effects of ssris on vmat2 activity
assessed by [3 h]dopamine uptake into puriﬁed synaptic vesicles
prepared from rat striatum.
male wistar rats (8–10 weeks old) were used in the present
experiments. animals were housed in groups of three under a
12 h/12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. the experimental procedures and housing conditions were
approved by the tokyo institute of psychiatry institutional animal
care and use committee. all animals were cared for and treated
humanely in accordance with our institutional guidelines on animal
experimentation.
haloperidol, ﬂuoxetine, ﬂuvoxamine cocaine, and reserpine
were purchased from sigma chemicals (st. louis, mo, usa).
methamphetamine was obtained from dainippon pharmaceuticals (osaka, japan). mdma was a generous gift from dr. y. minabe
(kanazawa university school of medicine). [3 h]dopamine (speciﬁc
activity, 1.036 tbq/mmol) was obtained from perkinelmer life and
analytical sciences (boston, ma, usa). all other chemicals were of
the highest grade available.

synaptic vesicles were obtained from synaptosomes prepared
from two rat striata by osmotic lysis [7]. brieﬂy, freshly dissected
tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose solution
using a teﬂon-glass homogenizer (10 strokes). the homogenate
was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was
collected and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g for 30 min. the resulting
pellet was resuspended by swirling in 2 ml of 0.32 m sucrose and
then was subjected to an osmotic shock by the addition of 7 ml
of distilled water and homogenized with ﬁve strokes. osmolarity was restored by the immediate addition of 1/10 vols of 0.25 m
hepes and 1 m potassium tartrate (ph 7.5). the suspension was
centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. the resulting supernatant was
centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 45 min. the supernatant was treated
with 1 mm  xxxd2534xxx  and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. the
ﬁnal pellet (synaptic vesicles) was immediately resuspended in the
assay buffer. all procedures were performed at 4 ◦ c. protein concentrations were determined by a bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad,
hercules, ca, usa). the synaptic vesicle fraction was immediately
used for subsequent experiments.
to determine the purity of the synaptic vesicle fraction, the
fraction was treated for negative stain and analyzed by electron
microscopy (jem1230; jeol, tokyo, japan). the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, at a protein concentration
of approximately 5 mg/ml. samples were dropped onto collodioncoated 400 mesh copper grids and stained with 2% phosphotungstic
acid for 60–90 s. excess stain was then removed with ﬁlter paper.
after drying, the grids were examined in a jem1230 electron microscope (jeol, tokyo, japan).
our preparations showed predominantly small, round, and clear
vesicles with a diameter of approximately 50 nm with minimal contamination from membranes and other organelles. the size of the
vesicles corresponded with that reported previously [25].
vesicular [3 h]dopamine uptake was performed by incubating
of synaptic vesicles (0.5 ␮g protein) in 200 ␮l assay buffer (ﬁnal
concentration: 100 mm potassium tartrate, 0.5 mm edta, 0.05 mm
egta, 4 mm kcl, 1.7 mm  xxxd228xxx , 2 mm atp-mg2+ , 25 mm
hepes, ph 7.5) in the presence of [3 h]dopamine (8 nm ﬁnal concentration except in kinetic studies) at 30 ◦ c for 4 min. in the kinetic
studies, concentrations of [3 h]dopamine ranged from 2 to 200 nm
were used. the uptake reaction was terminated by the addition
of 2 ml ice-cold wash buffer (substituted atp-mg2+ from assay
buffer) and rapid ﬁltration through a whatman gf/b glass ﬁber
ﬁlter presoaked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine for at least 1 h. filters were washed three times with 3 ml ice-cold wash buffer, and
ﬁlter-bound radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation
counter. nonspeciﬁc uptake was determined by measuring vesicular [3 h]dopamine uptake in the presence of 2.5 ␮m reserpine. in
the competition studies, the ic50 value was analyzed by graphpad
prism software (graphpad, san diego, ca, usa).
[3 h]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles was highly dependent on the presence of  xxxd83xxx  (atp)/mg2+ .
in the absence of atp, [3 h]dopamine uptake was reduced by
approximately 97%, indicating the involvement of a mg2+ -atpase.
[3 h]dopamine uptake was linear with time up to 6 min and was
abolished by a low temperature (4 ◦ c). kinetic analysis of the
lineweaver–burk plot revealed a single uptake component (km ,
313.3 nm; vmax , 0.037 pmol/min/␮g protein). these kinetic parameters for [3 h]dopamine uptake were consistent with those reported
previously [8,23], suggesting that this uptake is mediated by
vmat2.
ic50 values of the effects of test compounds on [3 h]dopamine
uptake were calculated from displacement studies (table 1). reserpine is a typical agent that inhibits vmat2 and is commonly used
for studying monoamine transport activity [27]. reserpine potently
inhibited [3 h]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles (ic50 , 12 nm).

mdma exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on [3 h]dopamine
uptake into synaptic vesicles, consistent with a previous report [27].
additionally, haloperidol, which is widely used as an antipsychotic agent, also showed potent inhibition of [3 h]dopamine uptake
(ic50 , 100 nm). interestingly, three of the tested ssris inhibited
[3 h]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles at a potency similar
to methamphetamine. the order of inhibitory potency was reserpine > haloperidol  ﬂuoxetine, paroxetine > methamphetamine,
ﬂuvoxamine > mdma. phencyclidine and cocaine (psychostimulants), and sultopride (a selective dopamine  xxxg656xxx  antagonist)
did not have any effect on [3 h]dopamine uptake into synaptic
vesicles up to concentrations of 100 ␮m.
to characterize the inhibition of ssris on vmat2, we performed
kinetic analyses of [3 h]dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles.
representative lineweaver–burk plots of [3 h]dopamine uptake
into synaptic vesicles in the presence or absence of inhibitors are
shown in fig. 1. the lineweaver–burk plots demonstrated a parallel shift of the lines in the presence of reserpine, suggesting
uncompetitive inhibition of vmat2-mediated dopamine uptake
by reserpine (fig. 1a). as shown in table 2, in the presence of
reserpine, the km and vmax values for [3 h]dopamine uptake into
synaptic vesicles were signiﬁcantly decreased. a student’s paired
t-test in the presence or absence of reserpine (n = 4) demonstrated
signiﬁcant differences in km and vmax (t = 3.379, p = 0.0431 and
t = 5.106, p = 0.0145, respectively). fluoxetine, in contrast, acted as
a noncompetitive inhibitor of vmat2 (fig. 1b). in the presence
of ﬂuoxetine, the vmax value for [3 h]dopamine uptake (n = 5) was
signiﬁcantly decreased (t = 2.894, p = 0.0444) while the km value
remained unchanged (t = 0.304, p = 0.7762).
recently, vmat2 was studied as a target molecule in mood
disorders. to investigate the effect of ssris on vmat2 function, we
measured atp-dependent and reserpine-sensitive [3 h]dopamine
uptake into synaptic vesicles. these isolated vesicles from rat striata
were mainly vmat2-containing vesicles, in which the characteristics determined by electron microscopy and kinetic studies of
[3 h]dopamine uptake were similar to previous reports [13,23,25].

().

moreover, we observed that the positive control drug methamphetamine inhibited vmat2 activity, and the negative control drugs
cocaine and phencyclidine did not. using these synaptic vesicles,
three ssris were demonstrated to inhibit vmat2 activity in vitro,
and the potencies of inhibition by the ssris were in a range of concentrations similar to methamphetamine. fluoxetine is reportedly
unevenly distributed in rat subcellular fractions. 40% is recovered
in p1 (nuclei) and p2 (mitochondria and synaptosomes) fractions
and 10% in p3 (microsomes) and soluble fractions, regardless of the
dose and route of administration (2.5–5 mg/kg, i.v., 10–20 mg/kg,
p.o.) [3], suggesting that ssris are transported into the
synapses.
paroxetine and mdma show almost identical ic50 values for
vesicular uptake of dopamine in vitro [1]. our present results are
consistent with previous data with paroxetine. additionally, gobbi
et al. [10,11] reported that 10 ␮m ﬂuoxetine evoked [3 h]serotonin
release from preloaded synaptosomes, suggesting that ﬂuoxetine may interact with serotonin storage vesicles. ssris would be
expected to get into monoaminergic neurons and potentially interact with vmat2 in monoaminergic neurons, but this has yet to be
demonstrated directly. our present results provide a clear explanation for ﬂuoxetine-induced loss of vesicular serotonin.
fluoxetine also produces a concentration-dependent inhibition
of the two-pore domain potassium (2-pk) channel,  xxxg1256xxx  [17].
 xxxg1256xxx -deﬁcient ( xxxg1256xxx −/− ) mice exhibit behavior similar to that
of wildtype animals treated with ssris such as ﬂuoxetine [15].
not only ﬂuoxetine, but also paroxetine and ﬂuvoxamine, inhibits
 xxxg1256xxx  at concentrations similar to those for vmat2 [15] (table 1).
henry et al. [14] showed that brain paroxetine concentrations in
patients with unipolar depression who were taking 20 mg/day were
shown to be approximately 2–14 ␮m in a ﬂuorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy study. interestingly, bolo et al. [2] reported
that brain concentrations of ﬂuvoxamine and ﬂuoxetine (12 or
13 ␮m) are 10-fold higher than corresponding blood levels (1.12 or
1.73 ␮m, respectively). therefore, these ssris at clinically relevant
brain concentrations possibly inhibit vmat2 and  xxxg1256xxx  activity.
these results suggest the need to consider these factors in the use
of ﬂuoxetine and other ssris.
from the kinetic analyses, ﬂuoxetine was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of vmat2. on the other hand, reserpine inhibited
vmat2 activity in an uncompetitive manner. reserpine potently
inhibits vmat2 and deﬁnes a high-afﬁnity monoamine uptake
recognition site and a low-afﬁnity monoamine binding site that
may release amines into the vesicle lumen [6]. however, merickel

et al. [18] showed that substrate recognition can be separated from
coupling as the driving force. they showed that mutation of d33n
of vmat2 eliminated transport activity but retained [3 h]reserpine
binding activity and coupling to the proton electrochemical gradient. considering that the reserpine binding site and substrate
recognition site on vmat2 are different, our results showing that
reserpine uncompetitively inhibited substrate transport does not
necessarily conﬂict with the previous report. the site of action
of ﬂuoxetine, however, may be different from that of reserpine,
reﬂected by a km value of vmat2 activity that was not affected by
the presence of ﬂuoxetine, suggesting that ﬂuoxetine cannot bind
to the substrate recognition sites of vmat2. the precise mechanism and site of action by which ssris alter vmat2 function remain
unclear, but the effects of the ssris, all weak amines, could be
through dissipation of the ph gradient and/or membrane potential
that is required for vmat2 function.
vmat2 heterozygous mice have been shown to exhibit
enhanced immobility in the tail suspension test (a depressive-like
phenotype) [9]. such an effect, however, may be more attributable
to compensatory changes in serotonin and/or dopamine function, particularly early in development, than to the reduction
in vmat2 levels per se. by contrast, elevated levels of vmat2
have been reported in the brains of bipolar disorder patients
[18,28], and increased vmat2 density (bmax ) in the platelets of
untreated patients with major depressive disorder compared with
healthy control subjects has been reported [29]. considering the
reduced vmat2 activity in a mouse depressive-like phenotype and
increased vmat2 levels in patients with depression, further studies
on vmat2 inhibition by ssris in clinical use are needed.
haloperidol potently inhibited vesicular [3 h]dopamine uptake
in the present study. this effect of haloperidol was not likely mediated via d2 receptors because the selective  xxxg656xxx  antagonist
sultopride showed no effect on vesicular [3 h]dopamine uptake in
vitro. haloperidol has been shown to affect ph gradient [19,20,22],
which is considered to regulate monoamine uptake into synaptic
vesicles [5]. haloperidol displaces [3 h]reserpine from up to 75% of
its binding sites [21], and reserpine binding to vmat2 is sensitive
to ph gradient/membrane potential, which could explain displacement of reserpine binding to synaptic vesicles by haloperidol.
in conclusion, the present study showed that ssris, including
ﬂuoxetine, paroxetine, and ﬂuvoxamine, inhibit vmat2 activity in
vitro. for future studies focused on the development of new antidepressants, investigation of vmat2 inhibition by ssris in clinical use
may be required.
