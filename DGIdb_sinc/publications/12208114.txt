mechanisms underlying the gastric toxicity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) have
been extensively investigated, whereas those leading to intestinal damage are not completely understood. several hypotheses have been put forward on the pathophysiology of intestinal damage by
nsaids: enhanced intestinal permeability, inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox), enterohepatic recirculation, and formation of adducts. the effects of cox-2 selective inhibitors, which appear to have
better gastric tolerability when compared to nonselective nsaids, on normal and inflamed intestinal
mucosa (as in crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) are still largely unexplored. if cox-2 inhibition
plays a key role in suppressing the inflammatory process, recent evidence suggests that cox-2 products are involved in maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosa, in the healing of gastrointestinal
ulcers and in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). animal models of intestinal inflammation have so far yielded conflicting results on the effects of cox-2 selective inhibitors on the
intestinal mucosa. it is now clear that nsaids do not act through cyclooxygenase inhibition, but also
have different targets such as nuclear factor-kappab and/or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma .
the peculiar pharmacological profile of each compound may help to explain the different impact of
each nsaid on the inflammatory process and on ibd. notably, the  xxxd3159xxx  derivative  xxxd2579xxx 
is widely used in the treatment of ibd and is believed to act through nuclear factor-kappab inhibition.
although the use of cox-2 selective inhibitors remains contraindicated in patients with ibd, studying their effects on intestinal mucosa may offer new insights into their subcellulars mechanisms of
action and open new avenues for the development of novel therapies for ibd.

background
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are
among the most prescribed drugs because of their antiinflammatory and analgesic properties. however, their
use is associated with an elevated risk of damage to the
gastrointestinal mucosa and related complications [1–4].
henry et al. [5] studied the relative risk of gastrointestinal complications using a meta-analytical approach: the
meta-analysis showed wide differences among individual
drugs, although some of the differences may be explained
by dose.
because inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is central to both the beneficial and toxic effects of nsaids,

they have been regarded as a double-edged sword. the
discovery that cyclooxygenase (cox) exists in two isoforms, [6–8] with cox-2 being the primary isoform at
the site of inflammation, led to hypothesize that inhibition of this isoform accounts for the therapeutic benefits
of nsaids as anti-inflammatory agents whereas inhibition of cox-1 is responsible for the adverse effects
on the gastrointestinal tract. on this basis, intense efforts were made to develop selective cox-2 inhibitors
[9].
in the past decade, it has been recognized that nsaids
can damage not only the upper gut (stomach and duodenum [10]), but also lower segments of the gastrointestinal tract (table i). the mechanisms of injury to the small
bowel and colon are not as well characterized as those in
the upper gut. in particular, the impact of cox inhibition
on the intestinal mucosa in inflammatory bowel disease
(ibd) is controversial, all the more so because of the

recent finding that some nsaids may, in certain conditions, have a proinflammatory effect [11].
there is now growing evidence that nsaids act
not only by inhibition of cyclooxygenase pathway, but
also modulate cyclooxygenase-independent signal transduction pathways, which may be involved in both the
anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity of these drugs
[12].
interestingly, the  xxxd3159xxx  derivative 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) is widely used in the treatment
of ibd. its action is due at least in part to inhibition of
activation of the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  [13].
the aim of the present review is to focus on mechanisms responsible for damage to the intestinal mucosa by
nsaids, discussing the possible impact of cox inhibition in ibd.
mechanisms leading to intestinal
damage
an enteropathy can be detected in 20–60% of nsaids
recipients, depending on the method used for the diagnosis [14, 15]. although most of the clinical evidence on
the intestinal adverse effects of nsaids comes from case
reports [16], several experimental studies in animals allowed to put forward different hypotheses to explain the
possible mechanisms of enteric toxicity.

enhanced intestinal permeability
nsaids appear to cause specific damage to enterocyte
mitochondria during absorption by uncoupling oxidative
phosphorylation. the subsequent reduction in atp levels
in turn results in loss of integrity of intercellular junctions
with increased intestinal permeability. thus, the mucosa
is exposed to luminal aggressive factors, such as bile,
proteolytic enzymes, and bacterial degradation products
[16].
small intestinal permeability has been used to quantify
mucosal alterations induced by nsaids. these permeability changes have been detected by oral administration of probes such as 51 cr-edta [17], lactulose [18],
 xxxd2538xxx  [19], and polyethylenglycol [20]. the 4-day
faecal excretion of 111 in-labeled white cells has also been
used to assess nsaids enteropathy, although this test
involves exposure to radiation and is demanding on patients [16]. more recently, a simple faecal test has been
proposed to diagnose nsaids enteropathy [21]. single
stool faecal calprotectin concentrations were found significantly higher in nsaids recipients than in controls.
calprotectin is a  xxxg2038xxx  found in neutrofils, monocytes, and macrophages: it resists metabolic
degradation and can be measured in faeces, hence its use
as a quantitative marker of intestinal inflammation. interestingly, 44% of nsaids recipients had elevated faecal
calprotectin and 20% of these had comparable levels
of inflammation to those reported in patients with ibd
[21].
recently, smecuol et al. [22] have compared the effect of four different nsaids at equieffective doses on
gastrointestinal permeability and found that intestinal
permeability was significantly increased by naproxen,
indomethacin, and  xxxd2561xxx , but not by celecoxib.
whether other selective cox-2 inhibitors share this favorable profile awaits confirmation.

cox inhibition
while the development of a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor seems a rational approach to obtain gut-sparing
nsaids, the emerging role of prostaglandins as modulators of mucosal defense in situations in which the mucosa
is inflamed raises several issues that deserve consideration
[23].
growing evidence indicates that the classical cox hypothesis is oversimplistic: both cox-1 and cox-2 are
involved as a constitutive and as an inducible enzyme in
inflammation and cytoprotection [24]. indeed, two recent
studies in rats have shown that, whereas selective inhibition of cox-1 or cox-2 is not ulcerogenic, combined inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 induces severe lesions in
the stomach and small intestine suggesting an important
contribution of cox-2 to the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity [25, 26]. furthermore, cox inhibition during ulcer healing seems to be detrimental [24], as
indicated by the fact that indomethacin or diclofenac delay gastric ulcer healing both in experimental animals and
humans [27, 28].

pharmacological research, vol. 46, no. 1, 2002

studies of cox-2 mrna and protein expression
demonstrated that in rats cox-2 expression is strongly
upregulated in the margins of healing gastric ulcers [29].
at the site of ulceration, cox-2 appears to be the primary contributor to prostaglandin synthesis. cox-2 thus
appears to represent the second line of defense, which
is activated during ulcer healing to compensate for the
temporary loss of cox-1 occurring in the mucosa adjacent to the ulcer and assisting cox-1 in safeguarding
gastric mucosal integrity. interference of the selective
cox-2 inhibitor l-745 337 with healing dynamics of
experimental gastric ulcers was demonstrated in the rat
cryoulcer model [30]. similar results were obtained with
the selective cox-2 inhibitor ns-398 in mice and rats
[31, 32].
thus, although cox-2 selective inhibitors have been
shown to cause markedly less gastrointestinal injury than
standard nsaids in healthy animals and humans [33, 34],
they need to be assessed in conditions of preexisting gastrointestinal inflammation.
the role of eicosanoids in the intestinal inflammatory
process is not completely understood: several eicosanoids
are increased in ibd and a positive correlation exists between tissue levels of these eicosanoids and disease activity. cox-1 expression is detected in both normal and
inflamed gastrointestinal mucosa; in contrast, cox-2 is
expressed in epithelial cells in the upper portions of the
crypts and on the surface in crohn’s colitis and ulcerative
colitis, in villous epithelial cells in crohn’s ileitis and is
not detectable in the epithelium of the normal ileum or
colon. these findings suggest that cox-2 expression is
induced by inflammatory mediators in the different portions of the epithelium in crohn’s and ulcerative colitis
and in crohn’s ileitis [35, 36].
nonselective nsaids suppress prostaglandin synthesis
and can exacerbate some experimental models of colitis
[37]. cox-2 is upregulated in the colonic mucosa in both
experimental and human colitis [35] and appears to have
a beneficial effect in healing experimental colitis. on the
other hand, cox products are fundamental for the inflammatory process and cox-inhibition could be beneficial
[13].
the effects of nsaid therapy in patients with ibd have
been recently evaluated by bonner et al. [38]. this retrospective study failed to demonstrate a correlation between nsaids use and likelihood of active ibd, contrary
to prior studies. thus, there may be subsets of ibd patients who can tolerate nsaids with less likelihood of an
exacerbation of ibd [39].
there is evidence that prostanoids produced via cox-1
contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever, and that
prostanoids derived from cox-2 exert immunomodulatory and cytoprotective effects [40] and contribute to
the muscle hypercontractility that persists after bacterial
infection [41].
more recently, mccartney et al. [42] demonstrated that
the elevated production of prostanoids in human ibd is
dependent upon the activity of cox-2.

3

enterohepatic recirculation
reuter et al. [43] suggested that nsaid-induced small
intestinal injury in rats is largely dependent on the degree
to which the nsaid undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. initial changes in epithelial permeability, probably
caused by a topical irritant action of the nsaid, do not
necessarily lead to frank ulceration. with repeated exposure of the intestine to the nsaid, as it is excreted in
to the bile, further epithelial injury occurs and is exacerbated by elevated numbers of luminal bacteria. the elevation of enteric bacterial number occurs only with nsaids
that undergo enterohepatic recirculation. according to this
view, systemic suppression of prostaglandin synthesis by
the nsaid does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of small intestinal ulceration and the better intestinal tolerability of moderately selective cox-2 inhibitors
(e.g.  xxxd2065xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx ) is attributable to the lack
of enterohepatic recirculation rather than to cox-2 selectivity. if these findings are confirmed in humans, important new strategies for the development of gut-sparing
nsaids may be followed.

formation of drug enterocyte adducts
covalent binding of a toxicant to target macromolecules
is considered a key mechanism of cell injury [44]. formation of adducts by reactive diclofenac metabolites with
hepatic macromolecules has been described in the liver
of rodents; hepatic uridine-5 -diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (udpgt) is known to biotransform diclofenac
and other nsaids into acyl ester glucuronides [45].
atchison et al. [46] have investigated, first, the hypothesis
that formation of adducts between a reactive metabolite of
diclofenac and enterocyte constituents is a causal factor
in diclofenac-induced enteropathy in rats. this hypothesis was substantiated by the finding that adduction occurs
in proximity to the site of injury, adduction precedes temporally ulcer formation and its entity corresponds to the
magnitude of injuries.
damage by adducts depends on enterohepatic recirculation of nsaid: indeed, neither adducts nor ulcers were
detected in diclofenac-treated animals when their bile was
externally drained or their bile ducts were ligated.

cox inhibitors and ibd
animal models of ibd support the contention that
eicosanoids are involved in modulating tissue inflammation [47], but the studies on the impact of cox-2
inhibition on animal models of colitis are widely dissonant (table ii). in accordance with the central role of
eicosanoids in maintaining the inflammatory process,
karmeli et al. [48] demonstrated that cox-2 inhibitors
have a beneficial effect on experimental colitis in rats,
acting by reducing colonic eicosanoids generation. in
contrast, reuter et al. [49] demonstrated that selective inhibition of cox-2 can result in exacerbation of
inflammation-associated colonic injury, in accordance

with the detrimental effect of nsaid on gastric ulcer.
finally, lesch et al. [50] has shown that selective cox-2
inhibitors are unable to produce any significant beneficial
effect in experimental colitis.
notably, in these studies different models of experimental colitis, different compounds and different doses were
used.
only one study is available on the effect of a selective cox-2 inhibitor on colonic mucosa in human ibd
[42]. this study compared the effects of a highly selective cox-2 inhibitor, l-745 337 [51] and of a traditional
nsaid, indomethacin, on the release of prostanoids from
colonic mucosal biopsies obtained from both patients
with ibd (ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease) and from
normal controls. the marked increases in tissue prostanoid
production typical of active ibd are as sensitive to inhibition by l-745 337 as they are to indomethacin. the
elevated production of prostanoids in ibd is therefore dependent upon the activity of cox-2. this is an important
finding, since it is widely accepted that prostanoids of the
e and i class are generally protective within the human
gastrointestinal tract [52]. the authors concluded that
selective cox-2 inhibitors, by reducing the production
of prostanoids to the same extent as a traditional nsaid,
would reduce the cytoprotective effects of locally produced pge2 and pgi2 and so, like a nonselective nsaid,
aggravate mucosal damage.

current perspectives
an aspect that is often overlooked is that every nsaid
(whether or not it is a selective cox-2 inhibitor) is endowed with a range of pharmacological activities that may
lead to significant differences in the effects of an individual
agent on the inflamed mucosa. for instance, the salicylic
acid derivative  xxxd2579xxx  is widely used in the treatment of
ibd, and its anti-inflammatory action is due to inhibition
of activation of transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  [13].
 xxxg1559xxx  designates a group of transcription factors consisting of different proteins: in nonstimulated cells, it is
sequestered in the cytoplasm as a latent, inactive complex

bound to inhibitory proteins termed ikappab. many different stimuli (cytokines, lipopolysaccharides, bacterial,
and viral infections, activators of protein kinase c, oxidants) activate  xxxg1559xxx  by phosphorylation of ikappab via
ikappab-kinase. the action of  xxxg1559xxx  in the nucleus activates
the transcription of a wide spectrum of proinflammatory
genes with consequent production of cytokines, adhesion
molecules and enzymes involved in inflammation [13].
inhibitors of  xxxg1559xxx  activation have been shown to be
very potent anti-inflammatory agents. some nsaids,
such as  xxxd3219xxx ,  xxxd3259xxx , ibuprofen, and  xxxd2141xxx  have been unequivocally shown to cause antiinflammatory and anti-proliferative effects independent of
cyclooxygenase inhibition, through an action on  xxxg1559xxx 
[12]. in contrast, celecoxib did not inhibit but activate
 xxxg1559xxx , suggesting that its cyclooxygenase-independent
actions may also differ from those of nonselective agents.
it is not yet known whether this  xxxg1559xxx  activating effect
is shared by all cox-2 selective agents or whether it is a
special feature of celecoxib [53].
interestingly, some other nsaids, such as indomethacin (which does not inhibit  xxxg1559xxx ), diclofenac, ibuprofen,
fenoprofen, and  xxxd2122xxx , bind and activate (with
different affinity)  xxxg1807xxx  (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) [11, 12].
 xxxg1807xxx  are ligand-activated transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor family. known at the beginning as regulators of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism,
more recently ppars have been identified as important
players in the metabolism of lipid-derived inflammatory
mediators and in inflammation-related disorders, such as
atherosclerosis and ibd, acting principally by preventing
the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  [54–56]. the  xxxg1807xxx  is highly
expressed in the colonic mucosa and its activation has
been reported to protect against colitis. recently,  xxxg1807xxx 
agonists have been reported to attenuate colitis in a murine
model in which inflammation was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate [55]. this observation
suggested that  xxxg1807xxx  activators may be useful in the
treatment of patients with ibd. to activate transcription,
 xxxg1807xxx  requires heterodimerization with the retinoid
x receptor (rxr). the rxr/ xxxg1807xxx  heterodimers are

pharmacological research, vol. 46, no. 1, 2002

permissive to activation by both  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr ligands. more recently, desreumaux et al. [56] investigated
the potential effects of both  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr in an experimental animal model in which colitis was induced
by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene
sulfonic acid (tnbs). these authors, consistent with
work of su et al. [55], showed that administration of
 xxxg1807xxx  agonists, such as rosiglitazone or troglitazone
attenuated the inflammatory response in tnbs-induced
colitis. these results confirm that  xxxg1807xxx  ligands have
anti-inflammatory effects in the intestine. furthermore,
simultaneous administration of both  xxxg1807xxx  and rxr
ligands had a markedly synergistic beneficial effect on colitis, enabling a significant dose reduction for each agonist.
these data suggest that the synergistic anti-inflammatory
effect of rxr and  xxxg1807xxx  agonists could be beneficial
in a clinical setting, as it might avoid adverse events often
encountered when these agonists are used in monotherapy at higher doses and thus could represent an attractive
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ibd. it should
be noticed that most of the nsaids so far investigated
behave as partial  xxxg1807xxx  agonist and therefore they
have the potential to reduce the beneficial effects of a full
agonist [11].

conclusions
from the preceding paragraphs, it emerges that the mechanisms leading to intestinal damage by nsaids are different from those underlying the gastric damage. moreover,
the two different isoforms of cox seem to play different
roles in maintaining homeostasis of gastrointestinal mucosa and in the process of gastrointestinal ulcer healing.
the impact of cox-2 selective inhibitors on ibd is currently controversial: on one hand, cox inhibition is fundamental for the modulation of the inflammatory process;
on other hand, cox-2 inhibition seems to have a detrimental role in ulcer healing.
it is now clear that classifying nsaids on the basis of
their cox-1/cox-2 selectivity is simplistic because of the
wide spectrum of pharmacological activities possessed by
these compounds. knowledge of the full range of activities of each nsaid (cox selectivity, action on  xxxg1559xxx  or
 xxxg1807xxx  ) will help to clarify its therapeutic and safety profile. gaining insight into the cyclooxygenase-independent
effects may also open new avenues for the development
of new drugs for the treatment of ibd.
