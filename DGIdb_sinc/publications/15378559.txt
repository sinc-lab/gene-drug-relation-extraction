abstract:  xxxd2834xxx  (aloxı́(r), onı́cı́t(r)) is a potent, single stereoisomeric  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist developed to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. the pharmacokinetics and metabolic disposition of a single intravenous [14c]- xxxd2834xxx  (10 mg/kg, 0.8 mci/kg)
bolus dose were evaluated in six healthy volunteers (three males, three females) using serial blood,
plasma, urine and fecal samples obtained over 10 days. the safety, tolerability and cardiac effects
were assessed. radiolabeled metabolic characterization revealed that unchanged  xxxd2834xxx 
accounted for 71.9% of the total radioactivity in plasma over 96 h, with an extensive distribution
volume (8.34 l/kg) and mean plasma elimination half-life of 37 h. approximately 83% of the dose
was recovered in urine (40% as unchanged drug, with 50% metabolized; m9 and m4 were the
major metabolites) and 3.4% in feces. hydrolysis of urine samples suggests that the metabolites are
not b-glucuronide or sulfate conjugates of the parent drug or metabolites. the blood to plasma
concentration ratio of the total radioactivity was 1.2, on average, indicating little selective
partitioning in erythrocytes.  xxxd2834xxx  was generally well tolerated; headache was the most
frequently reported adverse event. electrocardiograms and 72 h holter monitoring revealed no
clinically significant changes.  xxxd2834xxx  circulates in plasma mainly as the parent drug. renal
elimination is the primary excretion route, with parent drug and metabolites m9 and m4
accounting for the majority of  xxxd2834xxx  disposition. these results indicate that both renal and
hepatic routes are involved in the elimination of  xxxd2834xxx  from the body. copyright # 2004

introduction
nausea and vomiting are common occurrences
with many cancer chemotherapy regimens, particularly cisplatin-based therapies [1–3]. selective
serotonin-3 (5-ht3) receptor antagonists given alone
or in combination with other antiemetic therapies
are the most efficacious and recommended treat*correspondence to: alberto macciocchi, md helsinn healthcare

ments; however, none are completely effective in
preventing acute (424 h after chemotherapy) and
delayed (>24 h after chemotherapy) chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting [1,4].
 xxxd2834xxx  (aloxı́(r), onı́cı́t(r)) is shown to
be effective in in vivo models of chemotherapyinduced emesis [5]. compared with other agents,
 xxxd2834xxx  has a longer elimination half-life
and has the strongest binding affinity for 5-ht3
receptors [6–9], which may contribute to the
prolonged antiemetic effect observed in clinical
studies [10–12].

two dose-ranging studies in us and japanese
volunteers who were administered a single
intravenous (i.v.) dose of  xxxd2834xxx  (range:
0.3–90 mg/kg) showed that systemic exposure
[auc (area under the plasma concentrationversus-time curve) and cmax (maximal plasma
concentration)] for  xxxd2834xxx  and its n-oxide
metabolite (m9) increased with increasing dose
[9]. the mean total body clearance, plasma
elimination half-life and apparent volume of
distribution was in the range 1.1–3.9 ml/min/
kg, 34–54 h and 3.9–12.6 l/kg in 80 us volunteers
and 2.6–3.5 ml/min/kg, 31–37 h, and 7.0–9.9 l/kg
in 32 japanese volunteers [9]. the objective of this
study was to determine the pharmacokinetics,
metabolism and excretion routes of  xxxd2834xxx 
after administration of a single i.v. dose of [14c] xxxd2834xxx  to healthy human subjects.

study design

[14c]- xxxd2834xxx  hcl (figure 1) solution was
provided in preservative-free 5 ml glass vials
containing 1.2 ml of [14c]- xxxd2834xxx  at a
concentration of 1.0 mg/ml (quantitated as the
free base) with  xxxd3213xxx  and sodium
phosphate in water for injection adjusted to a ph
of 7.4. study doses were prepared based on the
subject’s weight rounded to the nearest kilogram
on the day of dosing and were administered by
i.v. over 30 s.

six subjects (three males and three females) were
enrolled in this open-label study and received a
single i.v. injection of [14c]- xxxd2834xxx  (10 mg/
kg containing 0.8 mci/kg). the specific activity
was approximately 80 mci/mg. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review board of the
participating institution, and the study was
performed in accordance with good clinical
practice guidelines. all subjects provided written
informed consent prior to participation.

subjects
subjects were between 21 and 44 years of age and
within 15% of the average weight for their
gender, age and height. to rule out clinically
significant abnormalities, the subjects underwent
a medical history and physical examination; 12lead electrocardiogram (ecg); routine laboratory
testing, including hematology, blood chemistries
and liver function tests, within 3 weeks prior to
dosing; and two 24 h holter examinations within
1 month of study initiation. subjects were
required to have a negative drug screening test
and to have negative tests for hepatitis b surface

sample collection

liquid chromatography

blood samples (15 ml each) were collected from
the opposite arm into which the dose was
administered by direct venipuncture or indwelling catheter into a heparinized vacuum container 30 min before dosing and at 5, 15 and 30 min
and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h
after dosing. a portion (1 ml) of each blood
sample was immediately transferred to a polypropylene tube for analysis of total radioactivity
in whole blood. plasma was separated from the
remaining whole blood by centrifugation at
3000 rpm for 10 min, and then transferred to
polypropylene tubes.
urine samples were collected immediately
before dosing and over the following intervals:
every 4 h up to hour 12, once between 12 and 24 h
postdose, then every 24 h up to hour 240. total
urine volumes were recorded after each collection. a baseline stool sample was collected
within the 24 h before dosing, and complete
24 h fecal collections were made daily for 10
days. blood, plasma, urine and fecal specimens
were stored at 208c until analysed.

assay of extracts from plasma and urine was
based on tandem-partition and cation-exchange
liquid chromatography using two mobile phases
(0.07 m ammonium acetate adjusted to ph 4.5
with trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile). a bds
 xxxd3100xxx  c8 column (keystone scientific,
4.6  250 mm, 5 mm) and a scx column (whatman, 4.6  100 mm, 5 mm) were used with a threesegment elution sequence consisting of 13%
acetonitrile from 0–15 min, 13–30% acetonitrile
from 15–30 min, then an isocratic segment of 30%
acetonitrile until 45 min. for the urine samples,
 xxxd2834xxx  and its metabolites were measured
using high-pressure liquid chromatography with
a continuous-flow radiochemical detection method. the assignment of structure to an individual
radioactive peak was determined by co-elution
with either an authentic standard or a previously
isolated metabolite from animal studies.

determination of radioactivity
the total radioactivity in blood, plasma, urine
and fecal samples was determined using liquid
scintillation counting. briefly, duplicate aliquots
of whole blood (100 ml) were dried on paper
cones and assayed for total radioactivity by
combustion analysis with a sample oxidizer.
the 14co2 product was trapped in scintillation
fluid and assayed by liquid scintillation counting.
duplicate aliquots of plasma (200 ml) or filtered
urine (250 ml) were analysed by liquid scintillation counting. homogenized fecal samples
(100 mg) were dried on paper cones and
assayed for total radioactivity by combustion
analysis with a sample oxidizer. the 14co2
produced was trapped in scintillation fluid and
assayed by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
radioactivity counts were collected and corrected for quench, background and specific
activity.

assays of  xxxd2834xxx  and metabolites in plasma
and urine
aliquots of plasma (2 ml) or filtered urine (1 ml)
were mixed with 0.01m of sodium triphosphate
solution and small amounts of sodium hydroxide
sufficient to adjust the solution to a ph of 10. the
samples were applied to methanol-activated and
buffered (0.01m sodium triphosphate) c18 solidphase extraction columns (500 mg). the columns
were washed with water and then eluted with
0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol. the eluants
were concentrated to dry residues and dissolved
in 250 ml of 0.07 m ammonium acetate adjusted to
ph 4.5 with trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile
(87/13% v/v), and aliquots of this extract were
assayed by liquid scintillation counting to assess
total radioactivity recovery. for plasma, quantification of  xxxd2834xxx  and metabolites was
performed by postcolumn fractionation of the
column effluent and liquid scintillation counting
using 175 ml aliquots. fractions (30 s each) were
collected into scintillation vials and counted.

postdose) were subjected to enzyme hydrolysis.
glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of  xxxd2834xxx  were detected via urine extracts incubated
with either bovine b-glucuronidase or aerobacter
aerogenes sulfatase and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. the supernatants were then analysed
by liquid chromatography, as previously described. mass spectrometry was used to identify
unknown metabolites found in plasma and urine.

pharmacokinetic
analyses

and

metabolic

disposition

pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by
noncompartmental methods. plasma and urine
concentrations below the limit of quantification
were treated as zero in all calculations. concentrations of total radioactivity in all blood, plasma,
urine and fecal samples were determined. for
parent drug and metabolite m9, the mean
maximal concentration of total radioactivity
(cmax) and the time to reach mean maximal
concentration of total radioactivity ðtmax þ were
recorded from individual subject concentrationtime curves. the terminal elimination rate constant ðbþ was determined from the slope of the
terminal portion of the log-concentration versus
time curve by linear least squares regression
analysis of the plasma concentration-time profiles. terminal elimination half-life ðt1=2 þ was
calculated as (ln 2)/b. area under the concentration-versus-time curve from time 0 to the last
quantifiable concentration at time t (auc0last)
was calculated using the linear trapezoidal
method. auc01 was computed as the sum of
auc0last and the extrapolated area from the last
quantifiable time point to infinity using clast =b,
where clast is the last quantifiable concentration.
for  xxxd2834xxx , the total body clearance (clt)
was calculated as dose/auc01 . renal clearance
ðclr þ was calculated as ae01 =auc01 /body
weight, where ae is the amount of drug excreted
in the urine up to 1 after the dose and auc01
is the area under the concentration-time curve
from time 0 to 1 postdose. the apparent volume
of distribution ðvd þ was calculated as clt =b.

tries, urinalysis and vital signs}were performed
at baseline. assessments were repeated during
the dosing period and at the end of the study to
assess the tolerability of  xxxd2834xxx . adverse
events, elicited and observed, were rated as mild,
moderate or severe and assessed for seriousness
and the potential relationship to study medication. cardiac monitoring was performed
throughout the study and consisted of two 12lead ecg (baseline and at end of study) and
holter monitoring for 72 h after dosing. from the
ecgs the following parameters were evaluated:
overall rhythm, atrial and ventricular rates, pr
interval, qrs width, and uncorrected and corrected qt intervals.

results
radioactivity recovery
in six human subjects (three males, three females;
mean age: 35 years; 83% caucasian; mean
weight: males, 86 kg; females, 64 kg), a single
10 mg/kg i.v. dose of [14c]- xxxd2834xxx  was
eliminated predominantly in the urine. the
recovery of radioactive dose equivalents
(0–240 h) averaged 83.2%  6.5% in urine and
3.38%  1.54% in feces, with a mean total
recovery of drug of 86.6%  6.9% (table 1). the
recovery of the dose in urine and feces was
mostly complete within 144 h after dosing. less
than 5% of the dose was recovered in urine and
feces after 7 days. the recovery of radioactivity in
male and female subjects was similar.

pharmacokinetics
the pharmacokinetic parameters for total radioactivity and  xxxd2834xxx  in plasma are summarized in table 2. plasma concentrations of the
major metabolite, metabolite m9, and the minor
metabolites were too low for reliable pharmacokinetic parameter estimation. mean plasma concentration-time profiles for total radioactivity
and  xxxd2834xxx  are shown in figure 2. the
mean cmax was 3.93 ng-eq/ml and 3.13 ng/ml for
total radioactivity and  xxxd2834xxx , respectively,

subjects. the mean total radioactivity auc01

was 39.4 h and 37.4 h for total radioactivity and
 xxxd2834xxx , respectively. the mean clt and
apparent vd for  xxxd2834xxx  were 160 ml/h/kg
and 8.34 l/kg, respectively. the mean renal
clearance of  xxxd2834xxx  was 66.5 ml/h/kg.
overall, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters
for males and females were similar. the mean
(standard deviation) of blood to plasma concentration ratios of total radioactivity between 5 min
and 24 h postdose was 1.19 (0.10), indicating little
selective partitioning of  xxxd2834xxx -derived
radioactivity into erythrocytes.

metabolic profiles
 xxxd2834xxx  and its three metabolites (m4, m5
and m9) were observed in the chromatographic
analysis of plasma extracts.  xxxd2834xxx , metabolites m9 and m4, and low levels of metabolite
m6 were observed in the pooled urine extracts.
representative chromatograms and retention
times for plasma and urine samples containing
 xxxd2834xxx  and its metabolites are shown in
figure 3. the major radioactive components (as a
percentage of administered dose) recovered in
urine were  xxxd2834xxx  (39.3%), metabolite m9
(12.5%) and metabolite m4 (10.9%) (table 3). the
urinary metabolites of [14c]- xxxd2834xxx  were
not susceptible to hydrolysis by either b-glucuronidase or sulfatase, indicating that the metabolites were not glucuronide or sulfate conjugates
of the parent drug or metabolites. the time
course for the appearance of the metabolites in
urine (144 h) was similar to that for total
radioactivity, and urinary metabolic profiles were
similar between males and females.
the metabolic pathways of  xxxd2834xxx  in
healthy human subjects are presented in figure 4.
with respect to metabolic characterization, the
structure of metabolite m4 has been fully
established. this metabolite is the s-isomer of 6hydroxy- xxxd2834xxx  (the position of the hydroxylation was confirmed by nuclear magnetic
resonance analysis). metabolite m5 was co-eluted
with the same metabolite isolated from dog
urine. definitive mass spectrometric and nuclear
magnetic resonance studies established the structure of metabolite m5 as isolated from dog urine
to be 6-keto-n-oxo- xxxd2834xxx . metabolite m6
was present at very low levels in pooled urine

however, because of the thermal instability of noxide analysis by this technique, the mass
response was 16 atomic units lower than the
theoretical atomic mass.

safety
no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred during the study. seventeen adverse
events were reported by five of the six subjects.
one subject accounted for 10 of these events due
to interconcurrent illness; these events were
assessed as not related to  xxxd2834xxx . the most
frequent adverse event was headache (83.3%,
n=5), reported from 3.5 h to 7 days after dosing.
vertigo, abnormal dreams, vasodilation, constipation, petechia, infection, lung disorder, contact
dermatitis, pain, sweating and lacrimation were
each reported once; none were assessed as severe
or as likely related to  xxxd2834xxx . no clinically
important changes in data were noted for

holter monitoring. only one subject had clinically important laboratory values (elevated
monocytes, basophils and eosinophils) outside

administration of  xxxd2834xxx .

discussion
after administration of radiolabeled [14c]- xxxd2834xxx ,  xxxd2834xxx  accounted for 72% of the
total radioactivity in plasma over 96 h, with a
mean plasma elimination half-life of 37 h. the
mean systemic clearance was approximately 12%
of hepatic blood flow, consistent with very low
hepatic extraction and elimination of  xxxd2834xxx  from plasma.  xxxd2834xxx  had a volume of
distribution of 8.34 l/kg, indicating extensive
tissue distribution. the levels of total radioactivity in erythrocytes were about 1.2 times
those of plasma, indicating little accumulation in
erythrocytes.  xxxd2834xxx  was essentially the
main radioactive component in the plasma,
which was consistent with the transient and
low concentrations of circulating metabolites
(m9, m4 and m5) detected in plasma.
in humans, nearly 80% of the administered
dose of  xxxd2834xxx  was recovered in urine
over 7 days, and of this total, approximately
40% of the dose was recovered as parent
 xxxd2834xxx . mean renal clearance was 42%

of the mean systemic clearance, indicating a
major contribution of the kidney to the clearance
of  xxxd2834xxx . about 50% of the administered
[14c]- xxxd2834xxx  was metabolized in humans.
the major metabolites in urine were m9 and m4.
in vitro studies of incubations of  xxxd2834xxx 
with individual cytochrome p450 enzymes
showed that cyp2d6 is the major enzyme
involved in the metabolism of  xxxd2834xxx ,
copyright # 2004 john wiley & sons, ltd.

followed by  xxxg590xxx  and cyp1a2 [17]. overall,
metabolism and disposition were similar in
males and females after i.v. administration.
because the major metabolites of  xxxd2834xxx ,
m4 and m9, have a low affinity for the 5-ht3
receptor and low systemic exposure, they probably do not contribute significantly to the
pharmacologic activity of  xxxd2834xxx . this
was confirmed by testing metabolites m4 and

been detected in the rat, dog and monkey,
although the metabolic profile of  xxxd2834xxx 
was quite different in these species.
compared with  xxxd2834xxx , ondansetron
undergoes more extensive metabolism (95% for
ondansetron vs 50% for  xxxd2834xxx ) [13]. the
more rapid metabolism of ondansetron results in
a much shorter duration of antiemetic action,
with a half-life of approximately 4 h, compared
with approximately 40 h for  xxxd2834xxx  [13].
both compounds have large volumes of distribution (2.35 l/kg vs 8.35 l/kg for ondansetron and
 xxxd2834xxx , respectively) and distribute into
erythrocytes. neither agent is extensively bound
to plasma protein (ondansetron 75% bound,
 xxxd2834xxx  62% bound) [13]. ondansetron
and  xxxd2834xxx  are eliminated mainly in urine,
with about 5% of ondansetron excreted unchanged compared with approximately 40% of
 xxxd2834xxx  excreted unchanged.

metabolic deposition of  xxxd2834xxx 

a similar study of the metabolism of singledose, oral  xxxd1924xxx  ([14c]- xxxd1924xxx  300 mg) in
six male subjects reported that 60% of the total
radioactivity was recovered in urine and 25% in
feces [14]. metabolites were quantified in urine
samples for up to 36 h postdose. in urine,
reduced  xxxd1924xxx  accounted for 17%–54% and
hydroxylated metabolites accounted for 9% of
the administered dose. most of the remaining
urinary radioactivity consisted of conjugated
metabolites of reduced  xxxd1924xxx  and hydroxyreduced  xxxd1924xxx . the glucuronide of reduced
 xxxd1924xxx  was the most abundant conjugate
in urine; only a small percentage (51%)
was identified as the n-oxide of reduced  xxxd1924xxx  [14].
 xxxd2834xxx  has the longest half-life compared with other available  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists [9]. intravenous doses of ondansetron, granisetron and hydrodolasetron produced
half-lives of 4–6 h, 5–8 h and 7 h, respectively [13,
15,16]. because  xxxd2834xxx  has low plasma
protein binding and is both renally and hepatically eliminated, there is a low potential for
drug–drug interactions. clinical advantages of
 xxxd2834xxx  may result from stronger binding
affinity, sustained plasma concentration profiles,
and a substantially longer half-life (40 h)
compared with other 5-ht3 antagonists.
