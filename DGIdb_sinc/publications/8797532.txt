depletion of striatal dopamine (da) has been hypothesized to explain some of the neurological and psychiatric complications of chronic use of cocaine, including increased risk for neuroleptic-precipitated movement disorders. we measured
levels of da, as well as two da nerve terminal indices, namely, the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and the vesicular monoamine
transporter (vmat2) in autopsied brain of 12 chronic cocaine users. mean da levels were normal in the putamen, the
motor component of the striatum; however, 4 of the 12 subjects had da values below the lower limit of the control
range. da concentrations were significantly reduced in the caudate head (head, -33%; tail, -39%) with a trend for
reduction in nucleus accumbens (-27%). striatal dat protein (-25 to -46%) and vmat2 (-17 to -22%) were
reduced, whereas dat determined by [3h]win35,428 binding was normal. in conclusion, our data suggest that chronic
cocaine use is associated with modestly reduced levels of striatal da and the  xxxg2149xxx  in some subjects and that
these changes might contribute to the neurological and psychiatric effects of the drug.

there is now developing an appreciation that a variety
of movement disorders can be associated with chronic
use of cocaine (see reference 1 ) . although epidemiological data are not yet available, these neurological complications of cocaine include choreoathetosis [ 2 ] ,
multifocal tics [ 3 ] ,mild resting tremor [4],and dystonia or parkinsonism precipitated by neuroleptic medication [5-71. the cocaine-induced motor effects appear to be typically subclinical unless unmasked during
cocaine withdrawal or neuroleptic exposure [2, 4, 5 , 71,
in which a dystonic reaction can be the most common
extrapyramidal abnormality [ 5 ] . in this regard, cocaine
users are three to four times more likely than other
hospitalized psychiatric patients to develop dystonic reactions to neuroleptic drugs [gi. in addition to the
neurological complications of cocaine, withdrawal from

long-term use of this psychostimulant is also associated
with a variety of abstinence symptoms, including dysphoria, anhedonia, and altered drug craving [8, 31.
cocaine is a potent blocker of dopamine (da) reuptake [ l o ] ,and its effects on motor, incentive motivation, and reinforcing behavior are believed to be mediated, at least in part, through activation of the brain
da neurotransmitter system (see references 11 and 12,
for extensive review). thus, it was originally proposed
[5, 8, 131 that both the extrapyramidal disturbances
and the dysphoric abstinence symptoms associated with
cocaine use might be due to depletion of this neurotransmitter following chronic use of the drug. the
above hypotheses have now been revised slightly to take
into account the results of more recent studies focused
on the relationship between specific patterns of behav-

ior and the anatomic organization of the basal ganglia
and the daergic pathways [12, 141. in this regard,
anatomic and physiological evidence indicate that the
putamen component of the striatum (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens) is part of a subcortical-cortical loop predominantly involved in the control of
movement [ 141, whereas the reinforcing and motivational effects of cocaine have been attributed to an action of the drug o n da neurons innervating the nucleus accumbens and, possibly, the medial prefrontal
cortex (see references 11 and 12). thus, it can now be
hypothesized that the extrapyramidal disturbances of
chronic cocaine use could be due to a depletion of
da in the putamen, whereas the dysphoric symptoms
during abstinence might be explained by a da deficiency in the nucleus accumbens. this could be due
to either a reversible change in da metabolismluptake
or a permanent degeneration of da nerve terminals.
however, the latter possibility is not generally supported by experimental animal investigations (see reference 15).
information o n the presynaptic da system in the
brains of human cocaine users is limited to conflicting
postmortem reports on the striatal and/or cerebral cortical  xxxg2149xxx  (dat), the plasma membrane carrier specific to da neurons, which transports
da from the synaptic cleft back into the da nerve
terminal (reduced [16, 171; elevated [18, 191) and an
in vivo positron emission tomography (pet) finding
of reduced ["f] xxxd2471xxx  utilization in
two users withdrawn from the drug [2o]. t h e major
aim of our investigation was to determine whether striatal levels of da and other da nerve terminal markers
are reduced in brain of chronic users of cocaine. w e
measured levels of da as well as noradrenaline and
serotonin, and their metabolites in representative basal
ganglia, cerebral cortical, and diencephalic brain areas
of 12 young chronic users of cocaine. t h e monoamine
data in striatum were compared with concentrations of
two da nerve terminal markers that are severely reduced in idiopathic parkinson's disease [21, 221,
namely, dat and the  xxxg2099xxx 
(vmat2), which transports monoamine neurotransmitters (da, serotonin, and noradrenaline) from the
cytoplasm into synaptic storage vesicles. levels of dat
were determined both by a radioligand binding procedure using a radiolabeled cocaine congener (['hiwin
35,428) and by a quantitative western blotting technique, whereas vmat2 was measured by binding of
[3h]dihydrotetrabenazine ([3h]dtbz). since striatal
vmat2 is predominantly localized to da nerve terminals and, unlike dat, appears not to be regulated by
drugs that alter striatal da levels or function [23-261,
it has recently been proposed as a stable marker of
striatal da nerve terminal integrity [24, 271.

patients and methods
postmortem brain material from a total of 9 controls and
12 users of cocaine was obtained from medical examiner offices in little rock, arkansas; tampa and orlando, florida;
baltimore, maryland; and toronto, ontario, and new westminster, british columbia, canada. the mean ages (controls, 28.3 ? 3.6 years; cocaine, 32.7 ? 1.8 years; mean 2
se) and intervals between death and autopsy (controls, 15.4
? 1.8 hours; cocaine, 18.3 t 1.6 hours) were not significantly different ( p > 0.05, student's two-tailed t test). at
autopsy, one half-brain was fixed in fornialin fixative,
whereas the other half was immediately frozen at -80Â°c
until biochemical analysis. samples of cardiac blood were
obtained from all of the cocaine users and the control subjects for drug screening. scalp hair samples for drug analyses
could be obtained from 7 of the 12 cocaine users and 5 of
the control subjects. all brain neuropathological and neurochemical analyses were conducted in toronto. measurement
of levels of drugs of abuse in blood and other bodily fluids
were conducted by the local medical examiner, whereas drug
analyses in brain and hair samples were conducted at the
armed forces institute of pathology (washington, dc).
clinical, toxicological, and pathological data for the 12 cocaine users are shown in table 1.

control subjects
autopsied brain was obtained from 9 neurologically normal
subjects who died from a variety of causes (gunshot wound
to chest [2], chest trauma [2],cardiovascular disease [i],
myocardial infarction [ 11, perforated vena cava [ 11, leukemia
[ 11, and drowning [ 11). all subjects tested negative for drugs
of abuse in blood and urine. cocaine and metabolites could
not be detected either in autopsied brain (all subjects) or
scalp hair (5 subjects examined) using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) procedure (see below).

cocaine users
the 12 cocaine users were selected from a large group of
potential subjects who met the following criteria: (1) presence of cocaine andlor metabolites on toxicology screens in
blood or urine; (2) absence of other drugs of abuse in bodily
fluids with the exception of ethanol; (3) evidence from the
case records of cocaine as the primary drug of abuse for at
least 1 year prior to death; and (4) absence of neurological
illness or, at autopsy, brain pathology unrelated to cocaine
use. most of the potential subjects were rejected because of
a known history of significant polydrug abuse or the presence
of other drugs of abuse (primarily heroin metabolites) in
blood. clinical information was obtained by the medical examiners using a questionnaire format. in addition, information was received on some of the cocaine users through structured telephone interviews with the next of kin. all family
members who participated provided informed consent under
the guidelines approved by the institutional review board of
the university of toronto.

neuropathological analyses
neuropathological examination of the formalin-fixed half of
brain was performed after a minimum of 14 days of fixation.

five-micrometer-thick sections were stained with hematoxylineosin/luxol fast blue. bielschowski'ssilver staining technique was
used on selected blocks. in addition, for the examination of substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, sections were stained
with cresyl violet (30 pm),  xxxg883xxx  (5 pm),
and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (5 pm).

measurement of cocaine and metabolites
hair samples were collected in half-inch (0.5 in.) segments
relative to the root and washed by vortex mixing and sonication with 5 ml  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) and 3 x 5 ml
distilled water. segmented sample amounts (5-15 mg) were
extracted in 5 ml of 0.1 m hci at 55Â°c for 18 hours.
samples (ph 6.0 adjusted) ofhair and brain (100 mg), along
with standard curve samples containing spiked levels of cocaine, benzoylecgonine,  xxxd628xxx , norcocaine,
and cocaethylene, and blanks were extracted using solidphase extraction columns (worldwide monitoring clean
screen extraction columns no. zcdau020), derivatized
with pentafluoropropanol and pentafluoroproprionic anhydride, evaporated, and reconstituted with ethyl acetate. sample quantitation was performed by gc-ms using a hewlettpackard (hi')5989a mass spectromei.er operated in the
electron ionization selected ion-monitoring mode. the instrument was interfaced to a 5890 hi' gas chromatograph
operating with a j & w scientific db-5hds capillary column
(20 m, 0.18 mm id., 0.18 p m film thickness) using helium
as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mllmin. confirmation
was performed using a varian saturn 3 ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced to a varian 3400 gas chromatograph
operating with a j&w scientific db- xxxd1405xxx  capillary column
(15 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 p m film thickness). data were
collected in the full-scan electron ionization mode.

brain dissection f i r neurochemical analysis
cerebral cortical subdivisions were excised using the brodmann classification. following dissection of the cerebral cortical subdivisions, approximately 2.5-mrn-thick coronal sections of the brain were taken beginning with the anterior tip
of the head of the caudate nucleus to the tail of the caudate.
subcortical brain areas were dissected using the atlas of riley
[28] and as previously described [29, 301: one subdivision
of the caudate (intermediate portion of slice 4),putamen
(intermediate portion of slice 7), and nucleus accumbens
(subdivision "2a" as described in figure 1 of reference 30).

neurochemical analyses
da and metabolites homovanillic acid (hva), 3-methoxytyramine (3-mt), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (doi'ac); serotonin and metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - h i m )
and noradrenaline were quantitated by a high-performance
liquid chromatographic (hplc)-electrochemical procedure
[15]. as part of the validation of the dat and vmat2
markers, we recently reported that caudate and putamen levels of dat imniunoreactivity, ['hiwin 35,428 binding,
and [3w]dtbz binding are, as expected, markedly reduced
in striatum of patients with idiopathic parkinson's disease
and show the typical interregional gradient [31]. for measurement of dat and vmat2, samples were homogenized

in 100 volumes (wdvol) sodium phosphate buffer (25 mm,
p h 7.7 at 4Â°c; final sodium concentration, 48 mm) and
centrifuged at 35,ooog for 15 minutes. the resulting pellet
was resuspended in 100 volumes of buffer, dispersed into
three aliquots, and centrifuged at 35,ooog for 15 minutes.
the supernatant was discarded and the membrane preparation pellets stored at -80Â°c until assayed. o n the day of
the assay, the pellets were resuspended in 25 mm sodium
phosphate buffer, p h 7.7, for ['hiwin 35,428 and
l3h]dtbz assays (5 mg of original wet weight tissuelml).
[3h]win 35,428 binding was measured using minor modifications of the procedure of madras and co-workers [32].
in brief, striatal membrane preparations were incubated with
increasing concentrations (n = 10) of ['hiwin 35,428
(0.25-100 nm; 184.5 ci/mmol, nen) in 25 m m sodium
phosphate buffer, p h 7.7, for 2 hours at 0 to 4Â°c. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.5 p m  xxxd2546xxx . ["hidtbz binding was determined according to
minor modifications of the procedure of scherman and coworkers [22]. membrane preparations were incubated with
increasing concentrations (n = 10) of t3h]dtbz(0.25-30
nm; 155 cilmmol, amersham) in 25 m m sodium phosphate buffer, p h 7.7, for 90 minutes at 30Â°c. nonspecific
binding was determined in the presence of 1 pm  xxxd3330xxx . radioligand binding data was analyzed using ebda/
ligand (biosoft). equilibrium dissociation constants (kd)
and maximal number of binding sites
were estimated
using nonlinear regression models. the data were simultaneously fit to one- and two-site binding mode!s, and the
equation of best fit was determined using a partial f test.
saturation experiments revealed that, under the present conditions, the one-site model was preferred for ['hidtbz and
['hiwin 35,428 binding.
dat protein levels were determined by quantitative blot
immunolabeling using a recently and extensively characterized monoclonal antibody specific to human dat [33, 341.
in brief, the rat antibody was raised against a fusion protein
containing the putative n-terminus of the human dat. in
western blot studies, the antibody reacts selectively with
dat protein expressed heterologously in cells transfected
with dat cdna, with no detectable cross-reactivity to
other proteins expressed in untransfected cells or in cells expressing the closely related serotonin or noradrenaline transporters. the antibody also reacts strongly and selectively with
native dat protein expressed in brains of experimental animals and humans, with the size of the human dat protein
consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the cloned
central nervous system (cns) dat [35]. the immunocytochemical distribution of dat immunoreactivity with the
monoclonal antibody in brain [34] is identical to the distribution of dat using different polyclonal antibodies targeted
at distinct epitopes on the same protein [36]. a 200-pg protein aliquot of the membrane preparation was retained for
blot immunolabeling. samples were centrifuged at 12,500g
for 10 minutes at 4Â°c. the resulting pellets were resuspended in 10% sds (100 pl) and left at 25Â°c for 30 minutes, diluted with 50% glycerol (100 pl) and sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) sampler buffer (50
p1; 62.5 m m tris-hc1, p  xxxd736xxx , 10% glycerol, 2% sds, 5%
p- xxxd26xxx ) and left at 25Â°c for a further 30 min-

utes. samples were diluted i : 4 (5 pg proteinl25 pi), subjected to sds-page in slab gels (1.5 m m thick, 10% minigels), and the resolved proteins transferred electrophoretically
to polyvinylidene &fluoride (pvdf) sheets using a wet
transfer tank (32 v overnight). the iâvdf sheets were rinsed
briefly in water and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
tris-buffered saline (tbs) for 1 hour at 25Â°c. the sheets
were rinsed twice (5 minutes) in tbs-t (tbs with 0.1%
tween 20) and once (5 minutes) in tbs prior to incubation
with primary dat antibody in plastic boxes in tbs containing 5% nonfat dried milk, overnight at 4Â°c. the pvdf
sheets were washed in tbs-t, incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rat ig, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody from sheep [amersham], diluted 1 : 300 in tbs-t
containing 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  [bsa]) in plastic bags
for 1 hour, and washed in tbs-t at 25Â°c. after incubation
with chemiluminescence reagents (ecl, amersham), immunoreactivity was visualized by exposure of the blots to autoradiographic film, and quantified using a computer-based imaging device (mcid, st catharines, ontario, canada). five
concentrations of tissue standard, consisting of a pool of human caudate, were run on each gel together with eight samples (5 pg of protein each), and a standard curve (optical
density units vs micrograms tissue standard protein) was
plotted for each gel. the amount of dat protein, which
was detected as a broad band (80-90 kda), in each lane was
calculated as pg tissue standard/5 pg of protein by interpolation from the standard curve. variance (coefficient of variation) within and among different blots was 7 and 10%, respectively.

results
clinical characteristics of cocaine users
as shown in table 1 , all of the cocaine users had used
the drug for at least 1 year (range, 1 to >10 years).
the route of administration varied among the different
subjects and included nasal (insufflation), smoking, intravenous, and oral administration. seven of the cocaine users smoked  xxxd1736xxx , either solely or in
addition to intranasal and oral routes of administration. three subjects were exclusively intranasal users
and two administered the drug intravenously. alcohol
was known to have been used by 8 of the cocaine users
as evidenced by review of the case records and by the
presence in bodily fluids or brain of ethanol or cocaethylene (the transesterification product of cocaine and
ethanol). no neurological abnormalities, including extrapyramidal disturbances, were reported in any of the
subjects with the exception of case no. 2 who developed a seizure disorder (apparently untreated) within
the last month of life.

toxicological studies
the results of the blood, brain, and hair toxicological
studies are shown in table 1 . cocaine and/or its metabolite benzoylecgonine were present in blood of all
of the cocaine users with the exception of case nos. 3

and 6 , who tested positive for cocaine and metabolites
in urine only. no other drugs of abuse or their metabolites were detected in blood or urine with the exception
of case nos. 10, 1 1 , and 12 who also tested positive
for ethanol and, for case nos. 1 1 and 12, cocaethylene.
levels of cocaine (range, 0.001-44 nglmg of tissue)
were detected in brain (caudate nucleus) of all of the
cocaine users with the exception of case no. 2, who
tested positive only for cocaine metabolites. benzoylecgonine (0.09-4.47 nglmg) and  xxxd628xxx 
(0.18-4.88 ng/mg) were observed in the brains of all
12 users of cocaine, whereas norcocaine could be detected only in case nos. 1, 4, 5 , 7,9 , and 1 1 (0.114.67 ng/mg). cocaethylene (0.002-0.95 nglmg) was
detected in the brains of case nos. i , 4, 5, 1 1 , and

12.
scalp hair samples were obtained for toxicological
screening from a total of 7 cocaine users. of these 7
cases, sectional analyses of drug levels could be performed on 5 cases (nos. 2 , 3, 7,9 , and 12) and showed
the presence of both cocaine and benzoylecgonine in
all 5 subjects. this provides the strongest physical evidence that these 5 cocaine users had, in fact, used the
drug repeatedly. for case nos. 4 and 6, the root end
could not be identified and, consequently, drug analyses were performed on the entire tangle of hair. analysis of these cases confirmed the presence of cocaine and
benzoylecgonine. no other drugs of abuse were detected in the hair samples with the exception of case
no. 2 for which levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine and
morphine could be detected.

interval between last drug administration
and death
the interval between the last use of cocaine and death
was less than 4 hours for case no. 1 (for which a witness was available). in addition, it is likely that case
no. 10 (found on a bathroom floor with a crack pipe
under the body) and case no. 11 (who showed the
features of acute cocaine delirium) used the drug
shortly before death. for the other cases, in the absence
of a witnessed event, the interval between death and
the last administration of the drug can only be estimated on the basis of cocaine and metabolite levels
obtained in the blood, brain, and hair, an estimation
made difficult by many factors including individual
differences in drug metabolism, slow redistribution of
sequestered cocaine into the blood, and postmortem
changes in drug levels. based on the drug toxicological
data, it can be estimated that 10 of the 12 cocaine
users, who all tested positive for blood cocaine, had
probably used the drug within the previous 2 or 3 days,
whereas case nos. 3 and 6 , both testing negative for
blood cocaine and metabolites, probably had not used
cocaine recently.

neuropatbology findings
brain histopathological analyses disclosed ischemichypoxic changes in 2 subjects (case nos. 2 and lo),
whereas 1 subject (case no. 9) showed evidence of a
subarachnoid hemorrhage consequent to a rupture in
the carotid artery. with the exception of case no. 11,
who showed mild diffuse gliosis without cell loss in
midbrain (including substantia nigra), there was no evidence of gliosis, cell loss, or lewy body formation in
the substantia nigra, nucleus paranigralis-parabrachialis, or locus ceruleus brain areas in any of the 12 cocaine users.

neurochemicd findings
table 2 shows the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters, and metabolites in brain of the control subjects
and the cocaine users. in the cocaine users, da concentrations were reduced by 15 to 39% in all examined
striatal subdivisions but with the changes statistically
significant only in the head (-33%) and tail (-39%)
of the caudate. the 27% da reduction in the nucleus
accumbens just missed being statistically significant ( p
= 0.08). in contrast to da, striatal levels of the da
metabolites hva, dopac, and 3.-methoxytyramine
were normal. no statistically significant differences
were observed for any of the monoamines or metabolites in the nucleus stria terminalis, medial olfactory
area, hypothalamus, nucleus pulvinar and lateralis of
the thalamus, lateral geniculate body, brodmann areas
6, 7b, 10, 10 medial, 11, 12, 17, 21, and 24, and in

and tail of the caudate nucleus, respectively, with the
exception of increased da in brodmann area 6
(+loo%, p < 0.05) and decreased s-hiaa in lateral
geniculate (-48%, p < 0.01) (data not shown).

as shown in table 3, dat protein immunoreactivity was decreased in caudate (-37%), putamen
(-25%), and nucleus accumbens (-46%) of the cocaine users, with the differences statistically significant
in caudate and nucleus accumbens ( p < 0.01). scatchard analysis revealed normal striatal density (b,,,=) of
[3h]win 35,428 binding, whereas [3h]dtbz binding was reduced by 17 to 22% ( p < 0.01 for caudate
and putamen; p = 0.09 for nucleus accumbens). no
statistically significant changes in the binding affinity
constants were observed with the exception of a slight
decrease in affinity of [3h]dtbzbinding in putamen
of the cocaine users ( p < 0.01).
examination of the individual striatal values (see fig
for da levels) revealed a marked overlap between the
range of all of the daergic markers in the control and
cocaine user groups. however, most of the da, dat
protein, and [3h]dtbz binding values for cocaine users fell below the control mean level with 4 to 6 cocaine users having values below the lower limit of the
control range. in contrast, there was almost total overlap between the ranges of [3h]win 35,428 binding
values in the control and cocaine user groups.
in the cocaine group, statistically significant correlations (pearson) between the different daergic indices
were limited to dat protein vs ["hidtbz binding

with the exception of a negative correlation between
total cocaine levels and nucleus accumbens da concentration ( r = -0.81, p < 0.01). no statistically signifi-

discussion
the major aim of this investigation was to determine
whether chronic exposure to cocaine is associated with
a brain da depletion. we found that da levels, on
average, were significantly reduced in the caudate nucleus, but not in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, or
in cerebral cortex. in addition, we found a discrepancy
in the cocaine users between striatd dat levels as
measured by radioligand binding (normal) and by
quantitative immunoblotting (reduced).

brain histopathological findings
in our neuropathological examination of the 12 cocaine users, we found a recent subarachnoid hemor-

rhage in 1 subject (no. 9) and recent ischemic-hypoxic
damage in a second case (no. 2). both of these cases
had striatal da levels close to the control mean value.
in addition, case no. 11, which had the lowest striatal
da levels of all of the cases assessed (caudate head,
1.39 ng/mg; putamen, 2.64 ng/mg), showed some
mild diffuse gliosis confined to the midbrain, including
the substantia nigra. the significance of this isolated
finding and its possible relationship to cocaine exposure are uncertain. qualitative examination of cellularity of pigmented cell bodies in the substantia nigra,
nucleus paranigralis-parabrachialis, as well as the locus
ceruleus, showed no evidence of neuronal loss in any
of the 12 subjects. to the extent that the group of
cocaine users examined are representative of those in
the general population, our data suggest that chronic
exposure to cocaine in young adult individuals does
not cause any substantial loss of whole nigrostriatal
neurones, a suggestion consistent with the recent report
of lack of nigral pathology in 6 cocaine overdose cases
[ 191. nevertheless, quantitative morphometric analyses
covering the entire anatomical extent of the midbrain
da cell body areas are needed to exclude early or mild
pathological changes in da cell morphology or density.

da
as mentioned in the introductory section, cocaine users
appear to be at above-normal risk for the development
of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal abnormalities, a
clinical observation that could be explained by a subclinical deficiency of da in the putamen. however,
we found that da levels, on average, were normal
(-15%, p > 0.05) in putamen of the cocaine users.
thus, our biochemical data do not provide strong sup-

wilson et al: effects of chronic cocaine use

435

port for the hypothesis that the higher incidence of
neutoleptic-induced movement abnormalities in cocaine users is consequent to a putamen da deficiency.
notably, even case no. 1 1 , who had the most marked
putamenal da reduction (-63%), had a concentration
of da (2.64 ng/mg) much higher than those observed
in idiopathic parkinson's disease (<:0.55 ng/mg [29]).
however, it is possible that the lack of significance
might have been due to the limited sample size in the
present investigation. in this regard, we did find that
4 of the 12 cocaine users had putamen da levels below
the lower limit of the control range (see fig). this
allows for the possibility that a subgroup of cocaine
users might have subnormal putamenal da concentration; however, a larger subject size is necessary to address this possibility.
two groups [8, 131 originally speculated that some
of the long-term consequences of psychostimulant use,
including drug craving and dysphoric features (depression and anhedonia) experienced during drug abstinence, might be related to a brain da deficiency. this
hypothesis has more recently been refined to take into
account the experimental animal data implicating one
subdivision of the striatum, namely, the nucleus accumbens, and the medial prefrontal cortex in the rewarding and dysphoric aspects of cocaine (see reference
12). supporting the da depletion hypothesis are the
observations that both synaptic [37, 381 and whole tissue [15] da levels in the nucleus accumbens are reduced in rodents during withdrawal from unlimited
access to cocaine by self-administration. in the present
investigation, the nucleus accumbens in human brain
was identified by the anatomical landmarks as described by hortnagl and colleagues ([30]see methods)
and was found, as expected ([30]see table 2), to contain about 10 times the concentration of noradrenaline
as that in the adjacent head of the caudate nucleus.
although mean da levels in the nucleus accumbens
of the cocaine users were not statrstically significantly
changed, the da depletion hypothesis does receive
some limited support from our finding of a trend for
decreased da concentration ( p = 0.08) in this brain
area, with 6 of the 12 cocaine users having da values
below the lower limit of the control range (see fig).
in addition, in view of the high negative correlation
observed between brain cocaine plus metabolite levels
and nucleus accumbens da concentrations ( r =
-0.81, p < 0.01), it is possible that the da reduction
might have been more marked, had we examined additional subjects who had been exposed to higher doses
of the drug.
striatal da levels in the cocaine group were significantly reduced in the head and tail of the caudate nucleus. since brain da concentrations are either normal
or even transiently increased following acute cocaine
administration in experimental animals [39-411, the

436

decreased caudate da levels are more likely to reflect
a chronic action of the drug (eg, reduced da biosynthesis). anatomic and physiological evidence indicate
that the caudate is part of a basal-ganglia thalamocortical loop subserving cognitive or psychomotor aspects
of behavior [14].in this regard, our biochemical data
support the notion [42] that the neuropsychological
deficits in cocaine users on tests (eg, wisconsin card
sorting test) of executive control abilities such as concept formation and shifting response strategy [42-441
might be related, as in parkinson's disease (see teference 45) to a caudate da deficiency.
da levels were normal throughout the entire extent
of the cerebral cortex, including the medial and lateral
aspects of the prefrontal and orbitoftontal cortices.
thus, our data suggest that doses of cocaine used in
humans are not sufficient to cause actual depletion of
tissue stores of da in cerebral cortex and that mesocortical da projections may be less susceptible to the effects of chronic cocaine than projections to the striatum.
since cocaine is an inhibitor of uptake of serotonin,
in addition to da, and synaptic levels of serotonin are
below normal in nucleus accumbens of rodents during
withdrawal from unlimited access to cocaine (see reference 38), it has been suggested that deficient serotonergic function in the nucleus accumbens could, in addition to altered daergic function, be a factor in the
cocaine withdrawal syndrome [38]. however, we found
that whole tissue levels of serotonin were normal in
the nucleus accumbens as well as in all other brain
regions examined.

dat
dat, as assessed by quantitative blot immunolabeling,
was reduced by 25 to 46% in striatum of the cocaine
users. this finding is consistent with postmortem observations that striatal dat, as measured by binding
of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  (-35 to -46% [16])and ['higbr
12,935 (-30% [putamen]; wilson jm, kish sj, unpublished observations), is decreased in chronic cocaine
users. since experimental animal microdialysis studies
show that ynaptic da levels in striatum are reduced
during withdrawal from chronic cocaine [37, 461, decreased dat could reflect a compensatory down-regulation of da uptake to normalize da neurotransmission. in this context, reduced dat, by prolonging the
action of synaptic da, would be expected to diminish
the consequences of any cocaine-induced decrease in
striatal da stores (see above) and of the effects of dopamine receptor-blocking neuroleptic drugs. because
of reduced capacity of the neuron to remove da from
the synaptic cleft, the response to subsequent administration of cocaine might also be enhanced. in this regard, repeated exposure to psychostimulants including
cocaine can result in a progressive increase in the motor

responses to a subsequent drug challenge in both the
rodent (see references 11 and 12) and in the nonhuman primate [47, 481. however, it is still unclear
whether such sensitization to any of the behavioral effects of cocaine (eg, paranoid psychosis) actually occurs in the human after repeated administration of the
drug.
unlike dat immunoreactivity, we found that dat,
as measured by [3h]win35,428 binding, was normal in
striatum of the cocaine users. this observation differs
from the results of two earlier postmortem brain studies
[ 18, 191 in which markedly increased high-affinity
[3h]win 35,428 binding density was observed in striatum ofcocaine users (reference 18, 115%;reference 19,
+500%) and from our own experimental animal findings, in which striatal [3h]win 35,428 binding was
markedly elevated during unlimited chronic access to cocaine by self-administration [ 151. however, our data are
more consistent with invivo single-photon emission computed tomographic (spect) imaging findings in a much
larger group of chronic cocaine users (n = 29) showing
that although mean striatal binding of the cocaine congener j3-[â231]citis slightly (+24%) elevated in abstinent
chronic cocaine users, there is considerable overlap between the range of values of the controls and the cocaine
users ([49], malison rt, personal communication). although the subjects in our study included cocaine users
having similar characteristics (eg, age, cocaine levels) as
in the two earlier postmortem investigations, the cause of
death for all of the subjects in one of the studies [19] was
described as âcocaine overdoseâ in which the interval between last cocaine exposure and death was probably very
short. thus, striatal [3h]win 35,428 binding might be
elevated during and, perhaps only transiently, following
acute withdrawal from a high dose of the drug, whereas
(as in our animal study [ 151) binding returns to normal
during prolonged withdrawal, as may have occurred in
the subjects in our study.
the discrepancy between [3h]win 35,428 binding
and dat protein determined in the same subjects
could be related to the ability of the probes to recognize different domains of the human dat. in this regard, whereas the dat antibody we used recognizes
an epitope on the n-terminal portion of dat, cocaine
interactions are proposed to occur closer to the dat
carboxyl terminus [50, 511. as such, cocaine-induced
posttranslational modifications of dat (eg, phosphorylation) or, possibly, proteolytic cleavage, might allow
for the differential recognition of dat protein by
[3h]win 35,428 and the dat antibody. while the
molecular mechanism(s) underlying the observed dissociation between measures of dat density as indexed
by immunoblot analysis vs [âhi win 35,428 binding
is unknown, we speculate that a possible explanation
for this discrepancy is that native dats may exist in
multiple conformational states such as monomeric and

+

multisubunit complexes. evidence in support of this
possibility is the demonstration that the estimated
functional molecular mass of the [âhiwin 35,428
binding site is at least twice as large as that estimated
from the deduced amino acid sequence 152, 531. in
this regard, the dat antibody employed in the present
investigation might recognize all molecular conformations of dat, whereas [3h]win 35,428 might bind
only to multisubunit conformations. the observation
that [âhiwin 35,428 binding is unaltered while the
relative density of dat immunoreactivity is reduced
in cocaine-exposed brain would suggest that only
monomeric forms of dat, insensitive to [3h]uin
35,428, are depleted.
further studies will be required to determine
whether striatal da uptake in chronic cocaine users is
reduced or normal, as predicted by concentration of
dat protein or [3h]win 35,428 binding, respectively. in this context, it may be noteworthy that highaffinity [3h]win 35,428 binding and actual da uptake can be dissociated in primary cultures of ventral
mesencephalon neurones [54] and in cos-7 cells [55],
suggesting that dat determined by quantitative immunoblotting might provide the better index of functional dat activity.

vmat2
experimental evidence indicates that several psychostimulant drugs, including methamphetamine and
methylene dioxymethamphetamine (mdma) are toxic
to striatal daergic and/or serotonergic nerve endings
in the experimental animal [56]. in contrast, animal
investigations suggest that chronic cocaine exposure
does not damage striatal monoaminergic nerve terminals (see reference 15). until quantitative morphological study of da nerve endings in postmortem brain
becomes technically feasible, assessment of changes in
da nerve terminal density in the human can only be
estimated with neurochemical markers and, ideally,
with probes that bind to nerve terminal components
that are not subject to up- or down-regulation. although [3h]dtbz also binds to vmat2 in serotonin
and noradrenaline neurones, it can be estimated on the
basis of relative neurotransmitter concentrations (see
table 2) that most of the binding in human striatum
is to the da nerve terminal. thus, in idiopathic parkinsonâs disease, striatal (putamen) [3h]dtbz binding
is severely reduced by about 85% [22, 311. o n the
basis of experimental studies showing that striatal binding of l3h]dtbz, unlike that of [3h]win 35,428, is
not affected by drugs altering synaptic levels of da or
da receptor function [23-261, kilbourn and colleagues suggested that vmat2 might provide a stable
index for the assessment of da nerve terminal integrity
in the human [24, 271. we found that in cocaineexposed human brain, striatal c3h]dtbz binding was

437

reduced, on average, only slightly (by 17-22%) but
statistically significantly in the caudate and putamen.
this is in contrast to our previous observations in the
rat, in which striatal ['hidtbz binding is normal
both during and following withdrawal from cocaine
self-administration [26]. t o the extent that vmat2
represents a static presynaptic daergic marker in human striatum, our data suggest that chronic cocaine
exposure in young adults could be associated with (at
most) slight striatal da nerve terminal loss. however, it must be emphasized that vmat2 might,
in fact, be subject to daergic regulation in the human and that reduced density of ['hidtbz binding
sites could reflect a down-regulation of vmat2 or
loss of synaptic vesicles without any loss of nerve terminals.

polydrug use
although the obtained clinical information suggests
that cocaine was the primary drug of abuse in all of
the subjects, most (and probably all) of these subjects
had also used ethanol, and 1 was found, on the basis
of hair analysis, to have used heroin. thus, chronic use
of other drugs of abuse could have influenced the brain
neurochemical findings. in this regard, ethanol appears
to enhance cocaine toxicity [57],whereas the effects
of cocaine and heroin combinations, an increasingly
predominant form of polydrug abuse [58] are still not
completely understood (see reference 59). although
our present sample size is too small to draw any firm
conclusions on these important issues, striatal da,
dat protein, and ["hidtbz reductions were still statistically significant following exclusion of the one cocaine user who had used heroin.

conclusion
we found that several neurochemic:al indices of da
nerve terminal components are reduced in striatum of
young users of cocaine and suggest that some of these
changes might contribute to or modify the behavioral
effects of repeated cocaine exposure. although we
could not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in putamen da levels in the cocaine group, onethird of the cocaine users did have values below the
lower limit of the control range; these data, therefore,
add some support to the early suggestion that caution
should be exercised in treating chronic users of cocaine
with da receptor blocking agents [ 5 ] . further studies
will be required to understand the importance of a variety of clinical variables (eg, age; drug duration and dosing pattern, withdrawal time; polydrug use) in modifying brain da function in the cocaine user. finally,
an interesting discrepancy was observed in the cocaine
group benveen dat as assessed by radioligand binding
and by quantitative immunoblotting. this finding may
have important implications for neuroimaging (pet,
