bibliography

several treatment approaches are available for treatment of depression.
however,  xxxd3089xxx  is the first selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor.
whereas formerly only noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors with a mixed
mechanism of action were available. these included action not only at
noradrenergic, but also at serotonergic and other neurotransmitter-sites.
thus,  xxxd3089xxx  represents the first of a new class of antidepressant agents
with specificity for the noradrenergic system.  xxxd3089xxx  has been shown
to be an effective first-line treatment for patients with all grades of depression, to be effective in the prevention of relapse and recurrence and to offer
significant benefits in terms of relieving the impaired social functioning
associated with depressive disorders.  xxxd3089xxx  was significantly superior
to the serotonergic compound fluoxetine in improvement of social
functioning in both the general depressed population and in those patients
who achieved symptomatic remission, indicating a superior quality of
remission. altogether  xxxd3089xxx  was well tolerated during the acute and
long-term treatment phase; side-effects such as increased sweating, constipation and dry mouth were the most prominent to be reported. the
availability of  xxxd3089xxx  represents a significant addition to the currently
available pharmacologic armamentarium for the treatment of depression.

introduction

depression is one of the most frequent of all medical illnesses
encompassing a range of mood disorders from mild depressed mood
(experienced by all of us from time to time) to severe, persistent mood
disturbances. recent estimates in the usa suggest that as many as one in
five adults will experience at least one depressive episode during their
lifetime [1], while in europe a 6-month prevalence rate of 6.9% for major
depressive disorder (mdd) was recently observed [2]. a feasibility study
conducted prior to the depres survey confirmed the effectiveness of lay
interviewers to identify depression using the depression section of the
mini-international neuro-psychiatric interview.
almost every aspect of a patient’s life can be affected by their depression,
including their productivity and ability to work, with financial implications
for themselves and their family, and their ability to participate in their
normal daily activities as a parent, spouse or family member [3]. the impact
of depression is not limited to the times when patients are experiencing an

acute episode. symptoms and psychosocial impairment often persist between the frank episodes of
depression, and the majority of patients will require
long-term treatment and support [3,4].

similar agents continues to impact on patient compliance and clinical outcomes, and attempts continue to
develop ever more effective treatments and reduce
the side effect burden.

despite the widespread prevalence of this disorder,
depressed patients often remain undiagnosed and
undertreated. the study by lépine and co-workers [2]
described above found that 69% of adults identified
with depression were not prescribed any treatment,
yet more than two-thirds of patients respond well to
pharmacotherapy. the treatment of depression is
mainly pharmacological, although supportive
psychotherapy may be effective in milder cases, and a
range of effective antidepressants are now available.
 xxxd3089xxx , a unique selective noradrenaline
re-uptake inhibitor (selective nri), is now available in
italy, uk, germany, spain, belgium, sweden, ireland,
finland, austria, argentina, denmark, brazil, peru,
mexico, venezuela, colombia, norway and central
america, and is indicated for the acute treatment of
depressive illness and major depression and for
maintaining the clinical improvement in patients
initially responding to treatment. this review will
present an overview of the current treatments for
depression focusing on the new antidepressant
 xxxd3089xxx .

at least 20 antidepressants are now available
worldwide for the treatment of depression (table 1).
they fall into a number of distinct pharmacological
classes exerting their antidepressant effects through
slightly different mechanisms. most affect the concentrations of neurotransmitters (serotonin,
noradrenaline and dopamine) in the synaptic cleft.
whether this is the direct mechanism by which these
agents exert their antidepressant effect remains
unclear, and longer-term adaptive changes may also
play a role.

2. currently

available antidepressants

depression is generally thought to arise from a
dysfunction in one or more of the monoamine
neurotransmitter systems of the cns and effective
treatments have been available since the 1950s. the
serendipitous discovery of the antidepressant effects
of the tricyclic agent, imipramine, represented a major
step forward in the treatment of depressive disorders.
however, the side effect burden of imipramine and

unmet needs of currently available
therapies
3.

while the antidepressant agents currently available to
the clinician offer effective relief from the core
symptoms of depression for the majority of patients,
considerable scope for improvement remains. the
majority of antidepressants currently available will
begin to relieve depressive symptoms after approximately 2 weeks of dosing. this delayed onset of
action means that patients must continue to experience the symptoms of depression for a considerable
amount of time after starting treatment and such a
delay can compromise patient compliance.
decreasing the interval between treatment initiation
and the onset of therapeutic effect is an important aim
of new drug development, although to date only
minimal gains have been made in this respect.
since the development of the early tricyclic agents,
attention has been focused on reducing the side effect

kasper, el giamal & hilger 773
burden of antidepressants. in general, rather than an
overall decrease in side effects, the newer agents
appear to be associated with different, perhaps more
benign, side effect profiles. this offers the clinician
greater scope in selecting an appropriate treatment for
individual patients.
severe depression often requires hospitalisation
leading to a significant disruption of the patient’s
personal life, time off work and possibly financial
hardship for the patient and their family, as well as
considerable costs to the health service. establishing
effective, well-tolerated treatments in this patient
group is particularly important. there has been some
suggestion that the currently available antidepressants
may vary in their efficacy among these patients and
evidence is emerging that the more serotonergic
agents may be less effective in the treatment of severe
depression than the more noradrenergic agents.
as in many areas of healthcare, quality of life for
depressed patients has gained increasing importance
in recent years [5]. social functioning, the ability of the
individual to function within their usual environment,
is often severely compromised in depressed patients
and has profound effects on quality of life. while the
treatment of social functioning has long been
recognised as a key feature of the treatment of other
mental disorders such as schizophrenia, it is only in
recent years that psychosocial parameters have been
recognised as important outcome measures for
depressed patients.

4.1

chemistry

 xxxd3089xxx  ((rs)-2-[(rs)-alpha-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)
benzyl] morpholine methanesulphonate) (figure 1)
is a racemic compound, being a mixture of the (r,r)
and (s,s) enantiomers, and is thought to produce an
antidepressant effect through the inhibition of
noradrenaline re-uptake in the synaptic cleft [6].
4.2

pharmacokinetics

the pharmacokinetics of the (r,r) and (s,s) enantiomers have been examined separately and although
the (s,s) enantiomer appears to be more potent in
tests predictive of antidepressant efficacy, no significant dif fer ences in phar macokinetics or
pharmacodynamics have been detected [7,8].
 xxxd3089xxx  is rapidly absorbed in humans, reaching

maximal plasma concentrations within 2 h with little
first-pass metabolism.  xxxd3089xxx  has linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 1 - 5 mg and an
elimination half-life of approximately 13 h which
makes  xxxd3089xxx  suitable for twice-daily dosing [8,9].
renal excretion of unchanged drug represents
approximately 9% of the administered dose [9]. as for
a number of other antidepressant agents,  xxxd3089xxx 
is extensively bound to plasma proteins (96% to  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx 
glycoprotein). bioavailability does not appear to be
affected by food [10] and displays no significant
gender effect [11]. based on the pharmacokinetic
profile outlined here, a daily oral dose of 8 mg (4 mg
b.i.d.) is recommended in adults.

4.2.1

 xxxd3089xxx  in elderly subjects

in middle-aged (50 - 63 years) and elderly (68 - 77
years) healthy volunteers the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3089xxx  (4 mg) do not appear to differ from those
of the general population (two studies in volunteers
aged 50 - 77 years). in very elderly volunteers (one
study in patients aged 66 - 98 years), systemic
exposure following a single administration of 4 mg
 xxxd3089xxx  was higher [12]. elimination was approximately twice as long as in young volunteers (24 h
compared with 13 h) and renal clearance was
decreased.  xxxd3089xxx  was well-tolerated in all
studies and there was no increase in the frequency or
severity of adverse events. a  xxxd3089xxx  starting dose
of 4 mg daily is recommended for patients ≥ 65 years
of age.

 xxxd3089xxx  in subjects with renal
impairment

4.2.2

in volunteers with moderate, intermediate or severe
renal impairment, renal clearance and total urinary
excretion tended to decrease as renal function
declined, resulting in somewhat increased plasma
exposure [13]. as a result, a reduction of the starting
dose to 2 mg b.i.d. would be prudent in such patients.

4.2.3

in volunteers with alcoholic liver disease, no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic
parameters were observed when a single dose of
 xxxd3089xxx  4 mg was administered. compared with
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3089xxx  4 mg determined
in a similar study in young. healthy volunteers cmax
was 22% lower, auc up to 92% higher and t½ up to
150% longer, which, while not statistically significantly different, are clinically noteworthy. the
severity of alcoholic liver disease did not appear to
affect  xxxd3089xxx  pharmacokinetics [13]. although
r eboxetine 4 mg was well-tolerated, it is
recommended that a starting dose of 2 mg twice daily
be used in such patients.
4.3

pharmacodynamics

 xxxd3089xxx  is a potent inhibitor of noradrenaline
re-uptake with only a weak effect on serotonin
re-uptake, and no effect on dopamine re-uptake
(more than 100-fold and 10,000-fold less than for
noradr enaline, r espectively). further mor e,
 xxxd3089xxx  has little or no effect on a range of
receptors commonly associated with the side effects
of other antidepressants including the muscarinic
cholinergic,  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -,  xxxg831xxx - and beta-adrenergic and histaminergic receptors.
 xxxd3089xxx  appears to have negligible effects on the
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of other drugs,
including the commonly used anxiolytic, lorezapam.
no inhibitory effects on the cytochrome p450
isoforms cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2d6,  xxxg589xxx  and
cyp3a4 (known to be involved in the metabolism of
the majority of drugs in therapeutic use) have been
observed [8]. notably, no significant inhibitory effects
were noted on the 2d6 isozyme involved in the
metabolism of a range of commonly used drugs
including the antidepressants fluoxetine, paroxetine
and venlafaxine, and certain antipsychotics [14]. the
lack of induction effect of  xxxd3089xxx  on the 3a4
isozyme suggests that the efficacy of drugs such as
oral contraceptives, steroids or carbamazepine are
unlikely to be reduced on co-administration [8].

clinical efficacy

a total of 1816 adult depressed patients (aged 18 - 65
years) and a further 347 elderly depressed patients
(aged > 65 years) have so far taken part in one of
seven short-term (4 - 8 weeks) and one long-term (1

year) randomised, controlled clinical trials in which
the efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  (8 - 10 mg/day in adults and
4 - 6 mg/day in the elderly) has been compared with
placebo, imipramine (150 - 200 mg/day in adults and
50 - 100 mg/day in the elderly), desipramine (150 - 200
mg/day), and fluoxetine (20 - 40 mg/day).
4.4.1

placebo-controlled studies

three of the four short-term placebo-controlled
studies demonstrated a statistically significant
advantage in favour of  xxxd3089xxx  both in terms of the
response rate (≥ 50% decrease in the mean ham-d
total score) and the mean decrease in ham-d total
scores at last assessment following up to 4 - 8 weeks
treatment [15] (table 2). a high placebo response rate
in the fourth study meant that no clear statistical difference was observed.
the clinical relevance of these findings has been
demonstrated in a cumulative analysis of the data
from all four placebo-controlled trials (figure 2). a
between-treatment difference in the mean ham-d
total score of 5.2 points (95% ci: 3.8 - 6.6) exceeds the
proposed clinically relevant effect size of 4 points
proposed by montgomery and others in 1995 [16].
4.4.2

comparator-controlled studies

the efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  in comparison with other
antidepressants including the tcas imipramine [17]
and desipramine [18], and the ssri fluoxetine [19] has
also been confirmed.
when compared with desipramine (100 - 200 mg/day)
the reduction in the mean ham-d total score favoured
 xxxd3089xxx  (8 - 10 mg/day), but did not reach statistical significance (mean decrease:  xxxd3089xxx  16.5
points vs. desipramine 14 points; table 2). furthermore, 60% of patients responded to  xxxd3089xxx 
treatment (p < 0.05 vs. placebo), compared with 48%
of patients who received desipramine [18].
a similar percentage of patients who received active
treatment achieved a response to treatment in the two
studies which included imipramine as a comparator,
with statistical significance in favour of  xxxd3089xxx 
being reached in the active-treatment-controlled
study (p < 0.05; n = 256; table 2) [17]. both studies
also demonstrated a comparable decrease in the mean
ham-d total score between the active treatment
groups (table 2) [17].

which included the ssri fluoxetine as comparator
(table 2). at last assessment in the placebocontrolled study, 48% of patients who received
 xxxd3089xxx  compared with 45% of those who received
fluoxetine were classed as in remission. in the activetreatment-controlled study the mean ham-d total

groups (mean improvement:  xxxd3089xxx  19.2 points,
fluoxetine 16.8 points; between-treatment difference

patients classified as in remission was 67% in both
treatment groups [19].

are more effective in the treatment of severe
depression compared with the serotonergic agents.
to examine whether the highly noradrenalineselective agent  xxxd3089xxx  was effective in the
treatment of patients with severe depression, a pooled
data analysis was conducted on the subset of patients
with severe depression from four of the clinical
studies described earlier. this analysis showed that
 xxxd3089xxx  was at least as effective as imipramine and
significantly more effective than fluoxetine in severely
depressed patients (figure 3), providing further
support for a differential hypothesis [26].

 xxxd3089xxx  in the prevention of relapse and
recurrence

4.4.4

in all of the active-treatment-controlled studies
described earlier,  xxxd3089xxx  was shown to be at least
as effective as other currently available antidepressants in the total depressed population.
4.4.3  xxxd3089xxx  in the treatment of severe
depression

the treatment of severe depression presents
particular clinical challenges. rapid symptom relief is
important in these patients who may require hospitalisation while their symptoms are at their worst. recent
studies and meta-analyses have suggested that not all
antidepressants are equally effective in treating this
special group of patients and the ssris are often
regarded as less effective than the tcas [20-25]. such
analyses have suggested that the noradrenergic agents

the chronic, recurrent nature of depression means
that antidepressants, in addition to relieving the acute
symptomatology, should also provide a sustained
effect and reduce relapse (worsening within the first 6
months following symptom resolution) and
recurrence rates (worsening 6 months or more after
resolution of the index episode). a recent placebocontrolled study has demonstrated the efficacy of
 xxxd3089xxx  (8 mg/day) in this respect.  xxxd3089xxx  is
significantly more effective than placebo in the
prevention of symptomatic relapse and recurrence
over 1 year [27]. just 22% of patients treated with
 xxxd3089xxx  experienced symptomatic relapse
compared with 56% of those who received placebo (p

response was also significantly higher for the

gaining increasing acceptance as a requirement for
new antidepressant agents and recent studies suggest
that not all antidepressants are equally effective in this
respect [5]. depressed patients who took part in two
studies, one of which was placebo-controlled,
comparing the efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  with that of
fluoxetine were also assessed for changes in their
social functioning during the 8-week treatment period
using the social adaptation self-evaluation scale
(sass) [28].  xxxd3089xxx  is significantly more effective
than placebo and fluoxetine in relieving the impaired
social functioning associated with depressive
disorders both in the general depressed population
and in those patients who achieve symptomatic
remission [19,29,30]. in the placebo-controlled study,

4.4.6  xxxd3089xxx  in the control of associated
anxiety

the frequent association between anxiety and
depressive symptoms has led to the inclusion of
anxiety measures in many of the commonly used
depression rating scales. an examination of the data
from items 10 and 11 of the ham-d scale have shown
that  xxxd3089xxx  is as effective as fluoxetine and statistically significantly more effective than placebo in
relieving the anxiety associated with depression.

further treatment options for  xxxd3089xxx 

preliminary evidence from two open pilot studies
support the efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  in the treatment of
seasonal affective disorder (sad) and the eating
disorder, bulimia nervosa. both studies were
conducted at the department of general psychiatry of
the university of vienna, austria. eleven out of sixteen
patients with sad showed a marked antidepressant
response to 8 mg of  xxxd3089xxx  daily within 6 weeks.
patients noticed that the core symptom of sad, lack of
energy, was specifically ameliorated [32]. of seven
patients with bulimia treated with 8 mg  xxxd3089xxx 
daily, four patients experienced a reduction in bulimic
symptomatolgy [33]. however, constipation was a
limiting side effect in two patients.
both pilot studies were conducted in a relatively small
number of patients but indicate the necessity for
further clarification in double-blind placebocontrolled trials. the indication for sad might be
specifically worth pursuing since lack of energy is a
core symptom and is likely to respond well to a
noradrenergic agent, such as  xxxd3089xxx .

 xxxd3089xxx  in the elderly

clinical efficacy data from placebo-controlled studies
in elderly patients are not yet available for  xxxd3089xxx 
which cannot therefore be recommended in this
patient group. however, in a study primarily designed
to examine the comparative tolerability of  xxxd3089xxx 
and imipramine, a similar decrease in the mean
ham-d total score was observed as well as similar
treatment response rates. this suggests that
 xxxd3089xxx  may be at least as effective as imipramine
in treating the elderly depressed [31].

safety and tolerability

most older antidepressants, even those described as
predominantly noradrenergic or serotonergic, interact
with more than one neurotransmitter system. in
addition, the older antidepressants often interact with
receptor sites not involved in their antidepressant
effect. in fact the side effect burden of a number of
these agents can be traced to their interaction with
specific receptors, for example, the propensity of the
tricyclics to interact with  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptors is

associated with events such as postural hypotension
and tachycardia.
the safety and tolerability of  xxxd3089xxx  has been
assessed in over 2600 depressed adult and elderly
patients. over 1500 patients received  xxxd3089xxx , 399
received placebo, and 711 patients received either
imipramine, desipramine or fluoxetine.  xxxd3089xxx 
was well-tolerated over both the short- (4 - 8 weeks)
and long-term (up to 1 year). over the short-term, the
majority of adverse events were moderate in severity
and discontinuation due to adverse events was low
and comparable with placebo ( xxxd3089xxx  8%,
placebo 7.5%) [33]. figure 6 shows the adverse events
reported by ≥ 2% of patients following treatment with
 xxxd3089xxx  vs. placebo. compared with imipramine,
no adverse events were more likely to occur with
 xxxd3089xxx  treatment although those treated with
imipramine were more likely to experience
somnolence (7% vs. 2% with  xxxd3089xxx ), tremor (15%
vs. 4%), hypotension and related symptoms (20% vs.
10%), and dry mouth (42% vs. 26%) [33]. somnolence
and gastrointestinal adverse events including
diarrhoea, and nausea and related symptoms, were
less likely to occur in patients treated with  xxxd3089xxx 
than those who received fluoxetine, while
 xxxd3089xxx -treated patients were more likely to
experience flushing, urinary hesitancy/retention,
paraesthesia, hypotension and related symptoms,
constipation and dry mouth. a single case of switch to

patient with unipolar depression [pharmacia &
upjohn, data on file]. further study is required to
confirm the additional benefit of  xxxd3089xxx  to
patients with bipolar depression in this respect.
dry mouth associated with  xxxd3089xxx  treatment is not
thought to be due to blockade of muscariniccholinergic receptors in the salivary glands as
 xxxd3089xxx  has virtually no affinity for these receptors.
szabadi and co-workers (1998) [34] suggested an
alternative mechanism via the noradrenergic inhibition of the parasympathetic salivary output.
the lack of muscarinic-cholinergic effects of
 xxxd3089xxx  are encouraging in terms of a low potential
for adverse cardiovascular effects during therapy.
indeed, in the review of tolerability data from the
series of clinical trials described above no clinically
important changes in blood pressure or significant
ecg effects (among those with abnormal findings at
baseline) were observed among adult patients who
received short-term  xxxd3089xxx  treatment. similarly,
during long-term therapy the frequency of clinically
relevant changes in blood pressure and treatmentemergent ecg abnor malities was low and
comparable with the frequency observed among
patients treated with placebo.
 xxxd3089xxx  was generally well-tolerated over the
long-term. 28% of patients who received  xxxd3089xxx 
for up to 1 year experienced at least one adverse event
compared with 23% of those who received placebo.
exp. opin. pharmacother. (2000) 1(4)

780  xxxd3089xxx : the first selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor
the discontinuation due to adverse events was low,
4% for those treated with  xxxd3089xxx  and 1% for those
who received placebo.
among elderly patients, who are often particularly
sensitive to adverse drug effects,  xxxd3089xxx  was also
well-tolerated. compared with imipramine the overall
percentage frequency of adverse events was similar
between the treatment groups ( xxxd3089xxx  68%,
imipramine 71%) [31]. the more serious adverse
events, such as hypotension and related symptoms,
and cardiovascular events, were more frequent
among patients treated with imipramine. moreover,
fewer serious adverse events, adverse-event related
withdrawals and treatment-related adverse events
were observed among  xxxd3089xxx -treated patients
[31].
suicide/attempted suicide rates were lower with
 xxxd3089xxx  (0.3%) than with placebo (0.5%) or
comparator drugs (imipramine 1.0%, fluoxetine 0.6%)
[33]. five cases of overdosage have been reported
involving ingestion of up to 112 mg of  xxxd3089xxx 
alone or in combination with other drugs. encouragingly, serious sequalae was not reported in any case
suggesting that  xxxd3089xxx  toxicity in overdose is low
[35].
a number of antidepressant agents are known to
adversely affect psychomotor and cognitive function.
in contrast,  xxxd3089xxx  does not appear to have any
greater effect on psychomotor or cognitive performance than placebo, even when combined with alcohol
[36]. furthermore, no sedative effects have been
observed and  xxxd3089xxx  may in fact confer a
vigilance-enhancing effect [37].
fewer patients treated with  xxxd3089xxx  reported signs
and symptoms on withdrawal or discontinuation (4%
of 143 patients) than did those who received placebo
(6% of 66 patients) indicating that  xxxd3089xxx  is
unlikely to be associated with significant withdrawal
signs or symptoms [33].

5. post-marketing

two-thirds of patients did not report any troublesome
side effects, with the profile being consistent with that
observed in controlled clinical trials.

6.

conclusion

 xxxd3089xxx , a novel selective selective nri, is the first
of a new class of antidepressant agents with specificity
for the noradrenergic system.  xxxd3089xxx  has been
shown to be an effective first-line treatment for
patients with all grades of depression, to be effective
in the prevention of relapse and recurrence, and to
offer significant benefits in terms of relieving the
impaired social functioning associated with depressive disorders [38].

7.

expert opinion

the availability of  xxxd3089xxx  represents a significant
addition to the currently available pharmacological
armamentarium for the treatment of depression. in
the general population,  xxxd3089xxx  is at least as
effective as the most widely used agents imipramine
and fluoxetine in relieving the core symptoms of
depression, offering sustained relief and fulfilling the
basic requirements of a new antidepressant agent.
the efficacy of  xxxd3089xxx  among patients with severe
depression is of particular interest. with the suggestion that the more noradrenergic agents are more
effective in the treatment of severe depression,
 xxxd3089xxx  offers an effective, sustained treatment
without the significant toxicity in overdose associated
with agents such as imipramine. the efficacy of
 xxxd3089xxx  in relieving the impaired social
functioning associated with depression is likely to be
of significant benefit to depressed patients, improving
their quality of life in addition to offering rapid,
effective symptom relief. the favourable tolerability
profile of  xxxd3089xxx  makes this agent an effective,
well-rounded, first-line therapy for depressive
disorders in adults.

surveillance

the early clinical experience with  xxxd3089xxx  in the
uk has been assessed through a questionnaire survey
of senior psychiatrists [34]. overall clinical response,
as judged by the treating doctor, was considered to be
‘good’ for 65% of patients with three-quarters of
patients showing ‘good/very good’ improvements in
their symptoms and activities of daily living.
