chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hypothermia were examined in mice. the «, receptor agonist
phenylephrine partially antagonized the hypothermia, while the dopamine d, receptor agonist apomorphine did not
inhibit it. the central serotonin, (5-ht,) receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodopheny])-2-aminopropane (dot)
strongly inhibited the chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hypothermia. both drugs at doses which can elicit
hypothermia antagonized head twitch responses mediated by the central 5-ht, receptor. these results suggest that
the chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hypothermia may be mediated by the blockade of the central 5-ht,

receptor.

chlorpromazine and haloperidol are typical neuroleptic
drugs used in therapy for schizophrenia. the neuro-
transmitter systems of dopamine and noradrenaline have
been implicated in the action of neuroleptics. it is well
established that the antipsychotic effects of chlorproma-
zine and haloperidol are due to their inhibition of the
central dopamine d, (d,) receptors.’? both drugs also
have an affinity for «, receptors.” it was suggested that
neuroleptic drugs including these two drugs have a high
affinity for serotonin, (5-ht,) receptors which may fur-
ther contribute to their antipsychotic effects.”

chlorpromazine and haloperidol affect thermoregula-
tion and induce hypothermia in humans and animals at
normal room temperature.***) however, the mechanism
of neuroleptic-induced hypothermia is not yet clear. we
therefore studied the effects of d,, «, and 5-ht, receptor
agonists on hypothermia induced by these neuroleptics in
mice.

materials and methods

animals male icr mice were obtained from slc
japan (shizuoka, japan). they were maintained under
controlled conditions of temperature ( 24+1 °c), humidi-
ty (55+5%) and lighting (dark period, 19:00—07:00).
experiments were performed between 13:00—17:00 at
the temperature of 24+1°c.

drugs and treatment the injectable forms of chlorpro-
mazine,  xxxd1677xxx  (yoshitomi pharmaceutical co.,
osaka, japan) and haloperidol,  xxxd2260xxx  (dai-nippon
pharmaceutical co., osaka, japan) were diluted with
saline. 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane
(doj) was purchased from research biochemicals inter-
national (natick, ma, u.s.a.) and dissolved in saline.
doi and chlorpromazine or haloperidol were injected i-p.
simultaneously on opposite sides.

measurement of body temperature and head twitch
body temperature was monitored using a thermometer
(nihon kohden, japan). a thermistor probe was inserted
2cm into the rectum. head twitch responses counted were

injection of doi and the neuroleptic.

statistical analysis the significance of differences was
determined by one way analysis of variance (anova)
followed by dunnet’s f-test in the experiments on body
temperature. head twitch responses were evaluated by
kruskal-wallis test followed by mann-whitney u-test.

results

effects of chlorpromazine and haloperidol on the rectal
temperature are demonstrated in fig. 1. both drugs
induced a dose-dependent hypothermia in mice. the
effects of «, receptor agonist phenylephrine, d, receptor
agonist apomorphine and 5-ht, receptor agonist doi on
rectal temperature are shown in fig. 2. phenylephrine
induced a significant hyperthermia at the doses of 2.5 and
5mg/kg (fig. 2a). apomorphine elicited a dose-related
hypothermia in mice (fig. 2b). do] elicited slight increases
in rectal temperature within +0.5°c, but these changes
were not significant. doi at a high dose of 5 mg/kg elicited
a significant hypothermia (fig. 2c).

effects of phenylephrine on the chlorpromazine
(2.5 mg/kg)- and haloperidol (5 mg/kg)-induced hypother-
mia are shown in fig. 3. treatment with phenylephrine
antagonized the chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced
hypothermia from 15 to 45min after the injection.
phenylephrine, on the contrary, enhanced the chlorproma-
zine-induced hypothermia 120 min after the treatment.

the effects of apomorphine on the chlorpromazine- or
haloperidol-elicited hypothermia are illustrated in fig. 4.
apomorphine slightly enhanced the chlorpromazine-
induced hypothermia, but did not affect the haloperidol-
induced decrease in the rectal temperature.

effects of doi on the hypothermia are demonstrated
in fig. 5. at doses of 0.1 and 0.5mg/kg, which did not
affect rectal temperature, doi powerfully inhibited both
the chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hypother-
mia.

the effects of chlorpromazine and haloperidol on head
twitch responses induced by doi at 1 mg/kg are shown
in table 1. both these drugs at dosages that induce the

discussion

it has been suggested that neuroleptics affect thermo-
regulation and can induce hypothermia.**) it was reported
that hypothermia elicited by neuroleptic drugs may be
mediated by the peripheral a, receptor, because the
peripheral «, receptor agonist phenylephrine inhibits
neuroleptic-induced hypothermia.°’ our results showed
that phenylephrine at 5mg/kg partially inhibited the
hypothermia induced by chlorpromazine and haloperidol.
our results are consistent with a previous finding.*
however, as shown in a previous study) and our present
results, phenylephrine even at a high dose only partially
inhibited this hypothermia, and its effects were not very
strong. therefore, another mechanism other than the «,
receptor may also be involved in the hypothermia caused
by these neuroleptics.

it is well recognized that neuroleptics block d,
receptors, and that this inhibition is primarily related to
the neuroleptic antipsychotic effects. the involvement of
d, receptors in thermoregulation has been reported: that
is, activation of d, receptors elicits hypothermia in mice
and rats.°”) as shown in our present results, similar
hypothermic effects were obtained by the activation of d,
receptors with apomorphine. since chlorpromazine and
haloperidol can block d, receptors,” it is supposed that
these neuroleptics may inhibit apomorphine-induced

hypothermia but, rather, enhanced the effects of
chlorpromazine. these results suggest that the inhibition
of d, receptors is not related to chlorpromazine- or
haloperidol-induced hypothermia and that another
mechanism is involved in the hypothermic effects of these
neuroleptics.

the involvement of serotonergic systems in thermo-
regulation has been suggested.**"*-?) as 5-ht receptor is
now divided into subtypes, the involvement of 5-ht in
thermoregulation has also been discussed with regard to
5-ht receptor subtypes. gudelsky et al.?) reported that a
central 5-ht, receptor agonist mk-212 elicits hyperther-
mia in heat adapted rats. there is thus a possibility that
the inhibition of 5s-ht, receptors may be related to the
chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hypothermia, so
that effects of the central 5s-ht, receptor agonist doi on
this hypothermia were examined in mice.

a previous report indicated that doi alone at a dose
of 3 mg/kg induced a + 1.5 °c increase in body temperature
in rats,'°’ but there has been no comparable report in
mice. in our study using mice, no apparent hyperthermia
was observed after treatment with various doses of doi
alone, indicating that there are differences in body
temperature response to doi between rats and mice. as
demonstrated, the central 5-ht, receptor agonist doi
induced a strong antagonism on chlorpromazine- and
haloperidol-elicited hypothermia and almost abolished
them. these results indicate that the hypothermia elicited
by the two drugs may be related to the central 5-ht,
receptor.

it was reported that chlorpromazine and haloperidol
have a high affinity for 5-ht, receptor and block the
response elicited by the activation of the central 5-ht,
receptor.”) we studied therefore whether chlorpromazine
and haloperidol at the doses used in our study, affect the
dol-induced head twitch responses mediated by the
central 5-ht, receptor.'!!?) we confirmed that both
these drugs at doses which induce hypothermia can block
dol-induced head twitch responses. this suggests that
chlorpromazine and haloperidol block the central 5-ht,
receptor-mediated responses. it was reported that head
twitch responses elicited by serotonergic drugs were
modified by the «, receptor.) however, as described
above, the a, receptor agonist partially inhibited
chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hypothermia,
indicating that hypothermia caused by these neuroleptics
may be connected to the central 5-ht, receptor.

thermoregulation involves the peripheral system as well
as the central nervous system. we previously demonstrated
that activation of the peripheral 5-ht, receptor induces

1583

hypothermia in mice.'*) as shown in the results, doi at
a high dose of 5mg/kg induced significant hypothermia
in mice, perhaps due to its activation of the peripheral
5-ht, receptor. however, it is unlikely that the peripheral
5-ht, receptor is related to the chlorpromazine- and
haloperidol-induced hypothermia, since the peripheral
5-ht, receptor is involved in hypothermia.!”

recently 5-ht, receptor was further subclassified into
5-ht 2, 2p, 2c receptors.’®) the 5-ht,, receptor subtype
refers to the classical 5s-ht, receptor, while the 5-ht,,
receptor was formerly called the 5-ht,. receptor. since
doi has an affinity for both 5-ht,, and 5-ht,,
receptors,’®) chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced
hypothermia are considered to be related to the 5-ht,,
and/or 5-ht,. receptor.

our present results indicate that the chlorpromazine-
and haloperidol-induced hypothermia are related to the
inhibition of the central 5-ht, receptor in addition to the
peripheral «, receptor. doi induces a strong antagonism
on the chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-induced hy-
pothermia. therefore, the central 5-ht, receptor may
have a more important role in the hypothermic effects of
neuroleptics than the peripheral «, receptor.
