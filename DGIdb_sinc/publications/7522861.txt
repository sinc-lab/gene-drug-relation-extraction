1 we have assessed the influence of a range of synthetic cationic polypeptides with putative inhibitory
actions at prejunctional muscarinic m2-receptors on electrical field stimulation-induced contraction of
guinea-pig isolated tracheal preparations. electrical field stimulation of epithelium-denuded guinea-pig
trachea resulted in frequency-dependent contractile responses. as expected, tracheal smooth muscle
sensitivity to electrical field stimulation was increased in tissues pretreated with the muscarinic m2receptor antagonist,  xxxd2174xxx . in contrast,  xxxd2174xxx  did not significantly alter the contractile potency
to acetylcholine.
2 unlike  xxxd2174xxx , the synthetic cationic polypeptides, poly-l-arginine, poly-l-lysine, poly-d-lysine,
the cationic dye ruthenium red and the anionic polysaccharide, heparin, failed to increase significantly
tracheal smooth muscle sensitivity to electrical field stimulation.
3 poly-l-arginine, ruthenium red and heparin had no effect on the contractile response to exogenously
applied  xxxd2586xxx .
4 these data are consistent with the concept that in guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle,  xxxd2174xxx  is an
allosteric antagonist of guinea-pig tracheal muscarinic m2-receptors, whereas the various cationic
polypeptides and the polyanion, heparin, are not.

introduction

methods

it has recently been demonstrated that a number of cardioselective muscarinic receptor antagonists including  xxxd2174xxx 
(lee & el-fakahany, 1991; ellis et al., 1991), the cationic
polypeptides protamine and poly-l-arginine (hu et al., 1992),
eosinophil-derived major basic protein (mbp, jacoby et al.,
1993) and the polyanion, heparin (gerstin et al., 1992) are
allosteric antagonists at cardiac muscarinic m2-receptors.
this is of particular interest given that activation of prejunctional muscarinic m2-receptors inhibits acetylcholine release
from cholinergic nerves and that the function of these receptors in the lung is attenuated in virus-infected (fryer &
jacoby, 1991) and ovalbumin-sensitized (fryer & wills-karp,
1991; fryer & jacoby, 1992) guinea-pigs in vivo. furthermore, muscarinic m2-receptor function appears to be altered
in asthma (minette et al., 1989).
it would appear that the function of muscarinic m2receptors might be modulated during an inflammatory response (jacoby & fryer, 1990). it has been suggested that the
alteration of receptor function following an inflammatory
stimulus might be a consequence of the removal of sialic acid
residues present on the extracellular domain of the muscarinic m2-receptor, presumably mediated by the action of
viral and/or inflammatory cell-derived neuraminidase (fryer
et al., 1990; fryer & jacoby, 1991; fryer & wills-karp,
1991). alternatively, cationic proteins released from inflammatory cells, notably eosinophil-derived mbp might act as
allosteric antagonists at prejunctional muscarinic m2receptors (fryer & jacoby, 1992; jacoby et al., 1993).
we have therefore investigated the influence of drugs that
are purported to act either as allosteric inhibitors at the
muscarinic m2-receptor on airway smooth muscle responses
in vitro to electrical field stimulation. some of the data
presented in this paper have been communicated previously
(spina, 1992).

albino guinea-pigs (300-500 g) were killed by cervical dislocation and the trachea removed and placed in cold (4'c)
krebs-henseleit solution, aerated with 95% 02 and 5% co2.
since it has previously been shown that the epithelium can
influence guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle sensitivity to
spasmogens (goldie et al., 1986), the epithelium was removed
from all preparations with a wooden probe. to confirm the
removal of the epithelium, paraffin embedded tracheal sections (8 jim) were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and
examined at the light microscopic level.
tracheal rings (2 mm) were suspended in dimethyldichlorosilane (40%)-treated 1 ml organ baths under an optimal tension of 1 g in krebs-henseleit solution aerated with 95% 02
and 5% co2 at 37°c. tissues were allowed to equilibrate for
30 min and changes in krebs-henseleit solution were made
every 10 min.  xxxd2586xxx  (10 pm) was added to the bath to
induce maximal contraction. after the contractile response
had reached plateau, the tissues were washed 5 times over a
15 min period and allowed to equilibrate for a further
30 min.

electricalfield stimulation studies
in order to obtain a predominantly cholinergic response to
electrical field stimulation, epithelium-denuded tracheal rings
were incubated in krebs-henseleit solution containing, the
cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 jim), the nonselective 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 am) and
the  xxxd2738xxx  synthetase inhibitor, n0-nitro l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name, 50 flm), 30 min prior to and during
electrical field stimulation. tracheal rings were placed
between 2 platinum electrodes and electrically stimulated for
10 s (current = 600 ma, pulse width = 0.5 ms, 0.1-30 hz) at
3.5 min intervals. unless otherwise specified, tracheal rings
were also incubated for 15 min with a-chymotrypsin (type
i-s; 2 units ml-') to degrade neuronally released vasointestinal peptide, before and during electrical field stimulation.

under the conditions described above, frequency-response
curves were obtained in the absence or following 30 min
incubation in the presence of the muscarinic m2-receptor
antagonists,  xxxd2174xxx  (30 and 100 gm) or methoctramine
(1 9m), or 1 h incubation with the cationic dye, ruthenium
red (1-10 am), the cationic polypeptides, poly-l-arginine
(mol. wt. 1600, 30 and 100 fig ml '), poly-l-lysine (mol. wt.
12000, 100 fig m1'), poly-d-lysine (mol. wt. 12000, 100 fig
 xxxg1167xxx ) or the polysaccharide, heparin (1000 units ml '). these
agents were also present during the construction of frequency-response curves. in the case of experiments with polyl-arginine, poly-l, poly-d-lysine and heparin, tracheal rings
were not incubated with a-chymotrypsin.

spasmogen studies
in some experiments, acetylcholine cumulative concentrationresponse curves were constructed in tracheal tissue in the
absence or presence of  xxxd2174xxx  (30 and 100 1m). in other
experiments,  xxxd2586xxx  cumulative concentration-response
curves were constructed in tracheal tissue in the absence or
presence of poly-l-arginine (10oigml-'), ruthenium red (3
and 10 am), or heparin (1000 units ml-').

analysis of results
results have been expressed as the geometric mean together
with 95% confidence limits or represented as the arithmetic
mean and standard error of the mean. the linear portion of
frequency-response curves (between 1 and 30 hz) was analysed by one-way analysis of covariance (ancova, kenakin,
1987). two way analysis of variance with repeated measures
was also used to analyse the responses to electrical field
stimulation. where appropriate, data were analysed by an
analysis of variance and a non-paired t test was performed to
test significance between means. the bonferroni correction
was used in cases where multiple comparisons were made
(wallenstein et al., 1980). data were considered statistically
significant if p <0.05.

drugs
the following drugs were used: indomethacin, (±)-propranolol hydrochloride, a-chymotrypsin (type i-s), ng-nitro
l-arginine methyl ester, acetylcholine,  xxxd2586xxx ,
ruthenium red, poly-l-arginine, poly-l-lysine, poly-d-lysine,
 xxxd2174xxx  triethiodide (sigma); standard unfractionated
heparin (delta west); methoctramine (research biochemicals
inc). all drugs were dissolved in krebs-henseleit solution of
the following composition, mm: nacl 117.6, kc1 5.4,
 xxxd2534xxx .7h20 0.57, kh2.po4 1.03, nahco3 25.0, glucose

epithelium-denuded guinea-pig trachea contracted in a
frequency-dependent manner in response to electrical field
stimulation, this response was abolished in the presence of
atropine (0.1 9am). at the maximum frequency tested (30 hz),
the contractile response was 73.7 ± 4.9% (n = 6) of the
maximal response (e..,s) to  xxxd2586xxx  (100 9am). the
muscarinic m2-receptor antagonist,  xxxd2174xxx , significantly
increased airway smooth muscle sensitivity to electrical field
stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner (p<0.001,

tracheal rings (figure lb).

cationic polypeptides
unlike  xxxd2174xxx , the synthetic cationic polypeptide, poly-larginine (figure 2a) failed to increase smooth muscle sensitivity to electrical field stimulation. a reduction in airways
sensitivity to electrical field stimulation was observed with
poly-l-arginine (100 fig ml-') which was not statistically
significant (p>0.05). poly-l-arginine (100lggml-') induced
a small increase in baseline tension of 13 ± 2%  xxxd2586xxx 
emax (n = 4) but had no significant effect on airway smooth
muscle sensitivity to  xxxd2586xxx  (table 1).
similarly, neither poly-l-lysine nor poly-d-lysine augmented contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (figure
3). in contrast and as expected, the muscarinic m2-receptor
antagonist, methoctramine (1 1am) significantly increased contractile responses to electrical field stimulation of tissue
preparations from the same animals (p<0.01).
in the absence of l-name, poly-l-arginine (100pgml-')
failed to augment the contractile response to electrical field
stimulation (10 hz; -39 + 8%, n = 3). in contrast, in tissue
preparations from the same animals, methoctramine enhanced the contractile response to efs (10 hz; 50 ± 8% of
control, n = 3, p <0.05 paired t test). the negatively charged
polyanion, heparin (1000unitsml-') was also without effect

capsaicin (10 jtm) caused a contraction of guinea-pig isolated
trachea equivalent to 67± 2%  xxxd2586xxx  em.
tachyphylaxis to capsaicin occurred such that a second
challenge with this agonist resulted in a significantly reduced
response (18 ± 4%, n = 6, p<0.05). however, significant
protection against capsaicin-induced desensitization was
afforded in the presence of the cationic dye ruthenium red
(3 tim) which is known to bind to sialic acid residues on the
surface of cell membranes (first dose; 53 ± 6%; second dose
46 ± 2%, n = 5, p> 0.05). in contrast, ruthenium red failed
to enhance airway smooth muscle sensitivity to electrical field
stimulation (figure 2b) or to exogenously administered
 xxxd2586xxx  (table 1).

discussion
increases in contractile responses to electrical field stimulation induced in the presence of the muscarinic m2-receptor
antagonists,  xxxd2174xxx  and methoctramine were observed,
consistent with inhibition of muscarinic m2-receptors located
prejunctionally on postganglionic parasympathetic nerves
and/or parasympathetic ganglia (fryer & maclagan, 1984;
faulkner et al., 1986; minette & barnes, 1988; yang &
biggs, 1991a). however, under conditions where we were
able to demonstrate the presence of inhibitory muscarinic
m2-receptors, we were unable to demonstrate any effect on
the function of these receptors by substances purported to
behave as allosteric inhibitors of such receptors.
these results are not consistent with the suggestion that
reduced muscarinic m2-receptor function accompanying airway inflammation in vivo, might be a consequence of the
removal of sialic acid residues present on the extracellular
domain of the receptor (fryer et al., 1990; fryer & jacoby,
1991; fryer & wills-karp, 1991) and/or an allosteric antagonist effect of mbp at prejunctional muscarinic m2-receptors
in the airways (fryer & jacoby, 1992; jacoby et al., 1993).
interestingly, no alteration in muscarinic m2-receptor function was observed in guinea-pig trachea taken from ovalbumin challenged sensitized animals in vitro (watson et al.,
1991; yang & biggs, 1991b) where an eosinophilia and
elevated mbp levels might also be expected.
the cardiac muscarinic m2-receptor contains 21 sialic acid
residues (peterson et al., 1986). the cationic dye, ruthenium
red is known to bind to neuraminidase-sensitive sites, i.e.
sialic acid, in rat heart as assessed histologically (woods et
al., 1982). it has been postulated that ruthenium red binds to
sialic acid residues present on sensory nerves and protects
them from damage by capsaicin (amann & maggi, 1991).
thus, it was expected that sialic acid residues present on the
extracellular domain of the muscarinic m2-receptor would
have been a target for ruthenium red. however, ruthenium
red failed to potentiate cholinergic responses in guinea-pig

isolated trachea despite protecting tracheal preparations from
capsaicin-induced desensitization.
a number of studies have demonstrated that  xxxd2174xxx  can
act as an allosteric antagonist at muscarinic m2-receptors, an
action that is significantly enhanced in low ionic strength
buffers (lee & el-fakahany, 1991; ellis et al., 1991). it has
recently been demonstrated that the synthetic cationic polypeptide, poly-l-arginine (hu et al., 1992) and mbp (jacoby
et al., 1993) also behave as allosteric antagonists at cardiac
muscarinic m2-receptors. however, we were unable to demonstrate this effect of poly-l-arginine as assessed by detectable changes in neuronal m2-receptor mediated modulation
of airway smooth muscle contraction. the reasons for the
discrepancy between the binding data and our results might
be attributable to the differences in the strengths of ionic
buffers used. this seems unlikely given that both  xxxd2174xxx 
and methoctramine significantly inhibited airway muscarinic
m2-receptor function. it is also possible that the concentration of poly-l-arginine used in this study was not sufficiently
high to antagonize m2-receptor function. both poly-larginine (hu et al., 1992) and  xxxd2174xxx  (ehlert, 1992) displaced 0.5 nm [3h]-n-methylscopolamine ([3h]-nms) binding
to m2 receptors from rat cardiac membranes with similar
affinity of 0.4 pm (approx. 5 pg ml-') and 1.1 im, respectively. furthermore, poly-l-arginine (hu et al., 1992) and
 xxxd2174xxx  (ellis et al., 1991; ellis & seidenberg, 1992) caused
the deceleration of atropine-induced displacement of [3h]nms (1 nm) binding from rat cardiac membranes with
similar potency (ic50 value of 0.5 jlm and 0.1-0.6 j4m, respectively). moreover, both poly-l-arginine (10lm, approx.
100 agml-') and  xxxd2174xxx  (10-100jlm) produced similar
maximal effects (ellis & seidenberg, .1989; hu et al., 1992)
with respect to deceleration of atropine-induced displacement
of [3h]-nms binding to rat cardiac membranes. poly-larginine and  xxxd2174xxx  also have a similar negative co-operativity value (stockton et al., 1983; hu et al., 1992; ehlert,
1992). thus, the concentration of poly-l-arginine used in this
study should have influenced m2-receptor function if it were
behaving as an allosteric antagonist. we could not use higher
concentrations of poly-l-arginine due to the ability of this
synthetic polypeptide to contract airway smooth muscle
(spina & goldie, 1994a). indeed, we have demonstrated that
the poly-l-arginine-induced contraction of guinea-pig isolated
trachea is mediated via the release of acetylcholine from
parasympathetic nerves (spina & goldie, 1994b).
the anionic polysaccharide, heparin can also behave as an
allosteric antagonist and thus, modulates the binding of the
muscarinic antagonist [3h]-nms to cardiac muscarinic m2receptors in low but not high ionic strength buffer (gerstin et
al., 1992). furthermore, oxotremorine-induced inhibition of
adenylate cyclase activity in myocardial homogenates was
antagonized by heparin in a concentration-dependent manner
(gerstin et al., 1992). in contrast, in the present study,
heparin failed to augment the contractile response to electrical field stimulation in vitro. the difference between these
studies is most likely due to the inability of heparin to
penetrate nerve cells in vitro. this is consistent with the view
that the ability of heparin to influence the binding of mus-

carinic (gerstin et al., 1992) and a-adrenoceptor radioligands
(huang et al., 1989) to their respective receptors in membrane preparations, is a consequence of an interaction
between the negatively charged heparin and positively
charged residues either on the g protein or the receptor
itself. this interaction would inhibit the coupling of receptor
to g-protein (huang et al., 1989; gerstin et al., 1992). thus,
it is possible that poly-l-arginine failed to augment contractile responses to electrical field stimulation in vitro, due to the
inability of the cationic polypeptide to interact with the
cytoplasmic domain of the receptor and/or g protein. polyl-arginine and mbp have been shown to attenuate [3h]-nms
binding to muscarinic m2-receptors in cardiac membranes
where access to the intracellular side of the cell membrane is
possible (hu et al., 1992; jacoby et al., 1993). alternatively,
the inconsistency between these radioligand binding studies
and the present study might be due to differences between
airway and cardiac muscarinic m2-receptors (kilbinger et al.,
1991). it has been demonstrated that presynaptic muscarinic
receptors might be classified as m4-receptors (mckinney et
al., 1993). thus, it is possible that the inability to detect
changes in presynaptic receptor function in this study to
poly-l-arginine might reflect the lower potency of polycations
at m4 than m2-receptors (protamine 6 fold less potent; hu et
al., 1992). however,  xxxd2174xxx  is 2-20 fold less potent at m4
than m2-receptors (stockton et al., 1983; ellis et al., 1991),
yet this antagonist augmented the contractile response to
electrical field stimulation.
it has recently been demonstrated in functional and
radioligand binding studies that the  xxxd2738xxx  synthetase
inhibitor l-name also acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist (buxton et al., 1993). this might account for the lack of
effect observed with a number of the agents used in this
study. however, this seems unlikely, given that in the
presence of l-name (50im), both  xxxd2174xxx  and methoctramine were able to antagonize muscarinic m2-receptor
function. furthermore, l-name potentiated electrical field
stimulation-induced contractile responses in guinea-pig
isolated trachea that was reversed by l-arginine (belvisi et
al., 1991). l-arginine failed to alter the purported ability of
l-name to act as an m2-antagonist (buxton et al., 1993).
these findings would suggest that l-name does not act as
an antagonist at prejunctional m2-receptors in guinea-pig
airways. finally, the present data show that in the absence of
l-name, poly-l-arginine still did not increase the contractile response to electrical field stimulation.
in conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate that synthetic cationic polypeptides behaved as allosteric inhibitors in
vitro. thus, inflammation-associated changes in airway m2receptor function might not be a consequence of an interaction between cationic polypeptides and the m2-receptor.
