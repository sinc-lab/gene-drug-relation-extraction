abstract
background/aims: our previous studies have shown that
supplementation with 17-estradiol (e2) from the onset of
diabetes attenuates diabetic nephropathy. however, e2 is accompanied by feminizing effects as well as adverse side effects on other organs. the current study examined the renoprotective effects of a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator,
raloxifene (ral), in an experimental model of diabetic nephropathy. ral activates estrogen receptors and estrogenreceptor-mediated cellular events without the side effects of
e2. methods: the study was performed in sprague-dawley
nondiabetic (nd),  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetic (d) and
 xxxd3249xxx -induced d + ral rats (n = 6/group). results:
after 12 weeks of treatment, d was associated with increased
urine albumin excretion (nd: 4.2 8 0.4; d: 41.3 8 9.0 mg/
day), glomerulosclerosis [glomerulosclerotic index; nd: 0.26

introduction

diabetes is associated with severe end-organ complications including diabetic nephropathy, one of the leading causes of end-stage renal failure [1–3]. epidemiological data suggest that women with diabetes are at a 5-fold
greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to nondiabetic women [4–6]. while the data regarding the risk of development and progression of renal
disease in diabetic compared with nondiabetic women
are not as definitive, mainly because it has not been adequately analyzed thus far, it appears that in the setting
of diabetes, women exhibit a greater risk of developing
renal disease compared with nondiabetic women [4, 5, 7,

materials and methods
animals
the study was performed in female sprague-dawley rats (harlan, madison, wisc., usa; 10 weeks of age). all animals were
maintained on a phytoestrogen-free rat chow (harlan) and allowed free access to tap water. the animals were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: nondiabetic (nd, n = 6), diabetic

raloxifene in diabetic nephropathy

(d, n = 6), and diabetic treated with raloxifene (d + ral, n = 6).
ral was administered from the onset of diabetes at a dose of 10
mg/kg/day in the phytoestrogen-free chow. these animals received ral-containing chow to achieve a dose of 10 mg/kg/day
and were then given phytoestrogen-free chow ad libitum.
diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of
55 mg/kg  xxxd3249xxx  (sigma, st. louis, miss., usa) in 0.1 m
citrate buffer (ph 4.5) after an overnight fast. nd animals were
injected with 0.1 m citrate buffer only. all d animals were given
daily subcutaneous injections of insulin (2–4 u, lantus, aventis
pharmaceuticals inc., kansas city, miss., usa) to maintain blood
glucose levels between 250 and 400 mg/dl. during the treatment
period (12 weeks), the animals were placed in metabolic cages for
24 h every 4 weeks and urine output and albumin concentration
were measured. after 12 weeks of treatment, the animals were
weighed, anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (40 mg/kg
i.p.) and blood collected (via cardiac puncture) for measurement
of plasma  xxxg1181xxx  (il-6) and serum creatinine levels. the
kidneys were weighed and then either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis or immersion fixed with histochoice
(amresco, solon, ohio, usa) for immunohistochemical analysis.
the experiments were performed according to the guidelines recommended by the national institutes of health and approved by
the georgetown university animal care and use committee.
urine albumin excretion and serum creatinine
urine albumin and serum creatinine concentrations were determined using the nephrat ii albumin and creatinine companion kits, respectively (exocell inc., philadelphia pa., usa), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the rate of urine albumin
excretion (uae) was calculated from the measurement of urine
albumin concentration and output.
morphology
following fixation, the kidneys were routinely processed to
paraffin, sectioned at 4 m and stained with periodic acid-schiff
(pas, for demonstration of glycogen deposition) or masson’s trichrome (for demonstration of collagen deposition). glomerulosclerosis was defined as mesangial expansion [15] and the glomerulosclerotic index was assessed in pas-stained sections using
a semiquantitative method as previously described [10]. tubulointerstitial fibrosis was defined as tubular atrophy or dilatation,
deposition of ecm proteins and the presence of inflammatory
cells [15]. tubulointerstitial fibrosis index was assessed in masson’s trichrome-stained sections using a semiquantitative method
as previously described [10].
immunohistochemistry
sections were cut at 4 m, incubated with 0.1% albumin and
then with antisera against transforming growth factor beta (tgf, 1: 100; rabbit polyclonal; r&d systems, minneapolis, minn.,
usa), collagen type i (1:100; mouse monoclonal; sigma), collagen
type iv (1:100; goat polyclonal; southern biotech, birmingham,
ala., usa) and cd68 (1:400; mouse monoclonal; serotec, oxford,
uk) at 4 ° c overnight. the positive immunoreaction was detected
using the envision plus peroxidase kit (dako corporation, carpentaria, calif., usa) and by counterstaining with mayer’s hematoxylin. sections incubated with 0.1% albumin instead of the primary antiserum were used as negative controls.

8]. these observations suggest that in the setting of diabetes, the mechanisms that protect women from developing renal disease are no longer effective. it is generally
thought that female sex hormone, namely estrogen, affords protection against the development of cardiovascular and renal disease [4, 5, 7, 8]. our recent findings show
that diabetes in females is associated with reduced levels
of circulating estradiol [9], suggesting that the loss of the
female gender as a protective factor against the development of cardiovascular and renal disease in diabetes may
be due to the imbalance of female sex hormones and their
receptor expression in target tissues [9].
these observations led us to perform studies on the
effects of 17-estradiol (e2) in an animal model of diabetic nephropathy that have shown that supplementation
with e2 from the onset of diabetes attenuates albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis
associated with diabetic nephropathy [10]. this renoprotective effect of e2 appears to be a direct effect on cell
proliferation and extracellular matrix (ecm), the two
major cellular processes adversely regulated in diabetic
nephropathy. however, regardless of the fact that e2 supplementation appears to offer renoprotection in diabetic
nephropathy, e2 has been reported to increase the risk of
developing breast cancer [11], and if administered in
males, may result in unwanted feminizing side effects.
thus, the most effective way of affording e2-mediated
renoprotection would be via eliminating its feminizing
and organ side effects.
raloxifene (ral), a selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator (serm), activates estrogen receptors and induces
estrogen-receptor-mediated cellular events without the
side effects of e2 [12]. ral has been shown to reduce mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in vitro
[13], while in vivo, ral has been shown to ameliorate
renal damage in a model of type 2 diabetes [14]. however,
the mechanisms by which ral exerts renoprotection in
diabetes are largely unknown. thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the renoprotective effects of
ral in the  xxxd3249xxx -induced model of diabetic nephropathy.

western blotting
homogenized samples were loaded on 18% (tgf-) or 4–20%
gradient (collagen type i and iv) sds-page gels and the proteins
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the membranes were
incubated first with 5% nonfat milk and then with antisera against
tgf- (1: 1,000), collagen type i (1: 1,000) and collagen type iv
(1:1,000; mouse polyclonal; chemicon, temecula, calif., usa) at
4 ° c overnight. the membranes were washed, incubated with igg
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and proteins visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (kpl, gaithersburg, md., usa).
the densities of specific bands were normalized to the total
amount of protein loaded in each well following densitometric
analysis of gels stained with coomassie blue. the densities of specific bands were quantitated by densitometry using the scion image beta (version 4.02) software.
cytokine levels
plasma il-6 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to manufacturers’ specifications (biosource international, camarillo, calif., usa).
statistical analysis
data are expressed as means 8 sem and were analyzed using
a one-way anova followed by a bonferroni posttest, using the
sigma stat software. differences were considered significant at
p ! 0.05.

uae and serum creatinine
the d rats exhibited a 9.8-fold increase in uae compared with nd animals (table 1). treatment with ral
partially attenuated this increase in uae associated with
diabetes; uae in the d + ral group was increased 5.0fold compared to nd (table 1). no differences in serum
creatinine levels were observed between the treatment
groups (table 1).
morphology
kidneys of d animals exhibited mild glomerulosclerosis (fig. 1a) and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (fig. 1b).
these kidneys were characterized by deposition of ecm
proteins in the glomerulus and tubulointerstitial regions,
mesangial expansion, tubular atrophy and infiltration of
inflammatory cells (these cells were identified as cd68positive cells, indicating the presence of macrophages
(fig. 5a)). the semiquantitative analysis of the degree of
glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis showed
a 7.2-fold increase in glomerulosclerosis and a 5.7-fold increase in tubulointerstitial fibrosis compared with nd
(table 1). treatment with ral completely attenuated glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis compared
with nd (fig. 1a, b; table 1).

discussion

our previous studies have shown that supplementation with e2 from the onset of diabetes attenuates the development of albuminuria, renal glomerulosclerosis and
tubulointerstitial fibrosis [10]. subsequent studies have
shown that the mechanism by which e2 attenuates glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis is via increasing ecm degradation and decreasing ecm synthesis [16]. while these studies clearly demonstrate a
renoprotective role for e2 in the setting of diabetes, supplementation with e2 longer term has been shown to induce carcinogenesis of uterus and breast [11, 17]. furthermore, if supplemented in males, e2 may result in unwanted feminizing side effects. thus, the aim of the current
study was to examine an alternative way of eliciting the
renoprotective effects of e2 that would eliminate its feminizing and organ side effects. ral is a serm that selectively activates estrogen receptors and induces estrogenreceptor-mediated cellular events without the side effects
of e2 [12]. as such, it is an excellent candidate for treatdixon /wells /singh /babayan /maric

anti-inflammatory role for ral. in the mouse thymus,
in contrast to e2, ral does not modulate t cell responsiveness and inflammation [26]. therefore, even though
most clinical and experimental studies show an anti-inflammatory effect of ral, further studies are needed to
determine the precise mechanisms through which ral
modulates the complex pathway of immune response and
inflammation.
thus far, very few studies have examined the effects of
ral in diabetes and its associated organ complications.
a post hoc analysis of data from the multiple outcomes
of ral evaluation trial, on the effects of 3 years of ral
treatment on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk
factors in women with and without type 2 diabetes, has
shown that even though ral does not affect glycemic
control, it has favorable effects on total cholesterol, lowdensity lipoproteins and fibrinogen levels [27, 28]. studies from this and other laboratories [14] suggest that
serms are beneficial in attenuating diabetic nephropathy, but whether serms have similar protective effects in
diabetic cardiomyopathy, neuropathy and retinopathy,
remains unknown. the effects of ral do appear to be
organ-specific. recent findings from the ral use for the
heart trial suggest that treatment with ral increases the
risk of venous thromboembolisms and fatal stroke and
decreases the risk of invasive breast cancer and vertebral
fracture, while it appears to have no effect on coronary
events in postmenopausal women with established or
with increased risk for coronary heart disease [29]. these
findings stress the importance of considering pre-existing disease and weigh potential benefits against risks
when recommending the use of ral.
while serms, including ral, were originally classified as antiestrogens [30], through activating both  xxxg730xxx  (er) and  xxxg731xxx 
(er), serms may act as both anti- and proestrogens,
depending on the relative abundance of er/er in the
target tissue or cell type [12]. in vitro, activation of er
by e2 has been shown to suppress renal mesangial cell
proliferation [31, 32] and increase collagen type i degradation [33, 34]. in contrast, in vivo studies from this and
other laboratories suggest that activation of er in the
diabetic kidney may contribute to glomerular damage [9,
35]. these conflicting observations suggest that er may
mediate different effects in different renal cells. ral has
a 14-fold higher affinity for er than er [36], suggesting that its effects are mainly mediated through activation of er. however, it is conceivable that the beneficial
effects of ral observed in the current study are partially
due to activation of the er. while er is only expressed

ment of longer-term organ complications, such as diabetic nephropathy.
our current study shows that similar to e2, treatment
with ral from the onset of diabetes attenuates diabetesassociated albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. we have found that one of the
mechanisms by which ral attenuates glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis is through decreasing
collagen type i and type iv protein expression, the two
major components of the ecm that are upregulated in
diabetic nephropathy. a recent study also found that
treatment with ral reduces expression of another ecm
protein, fibronectin, in a model of type ii diabetes, namely the db/db mouse [14]. in the cohen diabetic rat, treatment with tamoxifen, an analogue of ral, reduces diabetes-induced proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis [18].
in cultured renal mesangial cells, tamoxifen reduces collagen type i and type iv synthesis [13]. one of the factors
that contribute to increased ecm expression in diabetic
nephropathy is tgf- [19]. our study shows that treatment with ral decreases diabetes-associated increases
in renal cortical expression of tgf-. similarly, the study
examining the effects of ral in the db/db mouse has also
shown that treatment with ral reduces tgf- expression in the diabetic kidney. these findings suggest that
serms are effective in reducing ecm synthesis via reducing tgf- expression and thus may be beneficial in
attenuating progressive renal disease without the adverse
effects of e2 on other organs.
recent studies have suggested that diabetes is associated with low-grade inflammation and that the diabetic
kidney is characterized by the presence of inflammatory
cells [20, 21]. our studies show that diabetes is associated
with increased circulating levels of il-6 and infiltration
of macrophages in the renal cortex. treatment with ral
partially attenuated both il-6 levels and macrophage infiltration, suggesting that ral may have anti-inflammatory effects. recent studies report that treatment with
ral inhibits the expression of chemoattractant molecules and other markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women [22, 23]. while no studies thus far have
examined the anti-inflammatory effects of ral in the
kidney, several suggest that via suppressing the expression of markers of inflammation in the vasculature, including tgf-, ral decreases macrophage recruitment
to target sites and thus reduces vascular damage [24, 25].
since our study shows that ral attenuates tgf- expression in the renal cortex, this may be one of the mechanisms by which ral reduces macrophage infiltration in
the diabetic kidney. however, not all studies support the

in low levels in the diabetic kidney [9], it may be that its
largely unexplored actions are critical in regulating renal
cell function directly, or by modulating the actions of
er.

able to attenuate albuminuria and structure changes associated with diabetes, treatment with ral can also reverse these processes once they have already developed,
which would render it an effective treatment of diabetic
renal complications in females and potentially males.
