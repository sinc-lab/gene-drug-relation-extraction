a comparison of the effects of  xxxd2511xxx  with ziprasidone
and thioridazine on the release of dopamine and acetylcholine
in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens

abstract rationale: atypical, but not typical, antipsychotic drugs (apds), produce preferential increases in
dopamine (da) and acetylcholine (ach) release in rat
medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) compared to the nucleus
accumbens (nac). the increase in da release has been
attributed, in part, to their greater serotonin (5-ht)2a
relative to  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, while the basis for the
increase in ach has not yet been determined.  xxxd2511xxx , a
dibenzoxazepine congener of clozapine, is generally
considered to be a typical apd because it produces
significant extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) in humans, at
generally recommended clinical doses (60–100 mg/day),
and catalepsy in rodents, although several studies have
found it to be effective at lower doses which do not
produce significant eps. moreover,  xxxd2511xxx , like its
congener clozapine, has higher affinity for serotonin (5ht)2a than dopamine d2 receptors, in vitro, suggesting
the possibility it could be an atypical apd with clozapine-like potential. objectives: the purpose of this study
was to compare the effects of  xxxd2511xxx  on da and ach
release in the mpfc and nac with those of ziprasidone, a
novel atypical apd, and thioridazine, which is generally
classified as a typical apd. results:  xxxd2511xxx , 0.03–
10 mg/kg, increased prefrontal dopamine release with the
magnitude of this increase exceeding that in the nac, at
all doses, other than the 10 mg/kg dose. the effect of
 xxxd2511xxx  (0.3 mg/kg) on da release in the prefrontal
cortex was attenuated by way 100635 (0.2 mg/kg), a  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist, as is the case for other atypical apds.
ziprasidone (0.1–3 mg/kg) also preferentially increased

da release in the mpfc compared to nac. thioridazine
(5 and 20 mg/kg) did not increase da release in either the
mpfc or nac.  xxxd2511xxx  (3 mg/kg) and ziprasidone (1
and 3 mg/kg), but not thioridazine (10 and 20 mg/kg),
significantly increased cortical ach release. conclusion:  xxxd2511xxx  has effects on cortical and nac da and
ach release which are comparable to those of known
atypical apds. ziprasidone and thioridazine have effects
on cortical da and ach characteristic of atypical and
typical apds, respectively. it is concluded that further
clinical studies of the atypical apd properties of  xxxd2511xxx 
are indicated.

introduction
antipsychotic drugs (apds) currently used in the treatment of schizophrenia may be classified as typical or
atypical apds. atypical apds elicit fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) than typical apds at clinically
equivalent dosages (meltzer 1995). the atypical apds
also have other advantages, e.g. the ability to improve
cognition and a greater antidepressant action (meltzer
1995; meltzer and mcgurk 1999). most of the currently
available atypical apds (clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone), as well as some of
those in development, e.g.  xxxd2330xxx , org-5222, perosiprone, and blonanserin, are more potent antagonists of
serotonin (5-ht)2a receptors compared to their ability to
antagonize dopamine (da) d2 receptors (meltzer 1999).
this profile has been postulated to be a basis for low eps
in the case of clozapine (altar et al. 1986; rasmussen and
aghajanian 1988) and a general model for producing
atypical apds (meltzer et al. 1989; schotte et al. 1996). it
may also contribute to some of the other advantages of
current atypical apds over typical apds, e.g. more
effective treatment of cognitive impairment, depression,

and negative symptoms (kuroki et al. 1999; meltzer
1999).
 xxxd2511xxx , a member of the tricyclic dibenzoxazepine
family, has structural and pharmacological homology
with clozapine, the prototypical apd. the 5-ht2a
receptor affinity of  xxxd2511xxx  is higher than its  xxxg656xxx 
affinity in vitro, although the relative difference is smaller
than that of clozapine and the other atypical apds
mentioned above (table 1; meltzer et al. 1989; singh et
al. 1996). however, it has generally been classified as a
typical apd because of its eps profile in humans at usual
clinical doses (60–100 mg/kg) (depaulo and ayd 1982;
glazer 1999; meltzer and jayathilake 1999). it produces
catalepsy in rats at doses comparable to those that disrupt
the conditioned avoidance response or amphetamineinduced locomotor activity, two models for antipsychotic
activity (costall and naylor 1973; kalkman et al. 1998).
however, there is some evidence to suggest that the
incidence and severity of eps with  xxxd2511xxx  may be
lower than that of at least some typical apds (moore
1975; schwartz and brotman 1992).
meltzer and jayathiliake (1999) proposed that at
lower, e.g. 15–35 mg/day, compared to the customary
60–100 mg/day doses,  xxxd2511xxx  might produce more 5ht2a than da  xxxg656xxx  blockade in vivo and, thus,
like an atypical apd, should produce an antipsychotic
action with minimal eps. this hypothesis was tested in
an open study of low-dose compared to customary dose
 xxxd2511xxx  in patients with chronic schizophrenia. it was
found that  xxxd2511xxx , in doses of 35 mg/day or less,
produced significant improvement in psychopathology,
with minimal eps compared to customary doses of
 xxxd2511xxx  (meltzer and jayathiliake 1999).
positron emission tomography (pet) provides some
information relative to the issue of whether  xxxd2511xxx  has
an atypical like profile. typical neuroleptic drugs produce
optimal therapeutic response when striatal d2 occupancy
exceeds 60–70% (nordstrom et al. 1993). eps usually
require occupancy of 80% or higher (farde et al. 1992). in
a study of seven patients receiving  xxxd2511xxx , 10–100 mg/
day, d2 occupancy ranged from 52 to 90%; it was
estimated that a dose of 15–30 mg/day would produce d2
occupancy of 60–80% (kapur et al. 1996). it was
subsequently found that  xxxd2511xxx  produces equivalent
occupancy of 5-ht2a and d2 receptors at doses of 10–
100 mg/day, which differs from risperidone, clozapine,
and related atypical apd which produce higher levels of
5-ht2 than d2 occupancy (kapur et al. 1997). this

finding is consistent with rodent studies from our
laboratory, which found comparable occupancy of cortical and striatal 5-ht2 and d2 receptors (stockmeier et al.
1993), possibly due to the effects of an active metabolite
with higher d2 affinity. thus,  xxxd2511xxx  15–30 mg/day,
should produces occupancies of striatal d2 receptors
comparable to those of known atypical apds, such as
risperidone and olanzapine, whereas doses of  xxxd2511xxx 
greater than 40 mg/day should produce occupancies
greater than 80%, and thus eps (kapur et al. 1996, 1997).
the  xxxg1113xxx  blockade produced by  xxxd2511xxx  may
be able to prevent eps only when d2 occupancy is at or
lower than 80% and when  xxxg1113xxx  blockade is
enhanced with a supplemental 5-ht2a antagonist (kapur
and zipursky 1998). this suggestion is consistent with
recent preclinical data showing that 5-ht2a/2c receptor
antagonism may be useful to overcome catalepsy due to
 xxxg656xxx  blockade (lucas et al. 1997).
atypical apds, such as clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, have been reported to
produce greater increases in extracellular da levels in
meso-cortical da terminal areas such as the medial
prefrontal cortex (mpfc) compared to meso-limbic
projection areas, e.g. the nucleus accumbens (nac)
(kuroki et al. 1999; ichikawa et al. 2001). the preferential increase in da in the mpfc compared to the nac
has been shown to result from the combination of d2
receptor blockade produced by haloperidol and 5-ht2a
receptor blockade, produced by the selective 5-ht2a
 xxxd1422xxx , m100907 and sr43468b, a 5-ht2a/2c
antagonist (liegeois et al. 2002; bonaccorso et al. 2002).
it had previously been shown that the  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonism, relative to  xxxg656xxx  antagonism of the
atypical apds, predicted the preferential increase in the
extracellular da levels in the mpfc compared with the
nac (kuroki et al. 1999). the increase in mpfc but not
nac da release by the atypical apds has been shown to
be partially but significantly inhibited by way100635, a
5-ht1a antagonist. this is not only the case with
clozapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone, which are  xxxg1108xxx  partial agonists, but also with risperidone and
olanzapine, which are not 5-ht1a partial agonists (rollema et al. 2000; ichikawa et al. 2001). thus, stimulation of
5-ht1a receptors, directly or indirectly, is necessary for at
least a significant portion of the atypical apd-induced
increase in the mpfc da release. based on the evidence
that  xxxd2511xxx  has a higher affinity for 5-ht2a than d2
receptors, we postulated that  xxxd2511xxx  may also produce

317

greater increases in extracellular da levels in the mpfc
compared to the nac, and that this increase would be
inhibited by way100635. to confirm this hypothesis, we
also studied the atypical apd ziprasidone, which is more
potent as a 5-ht2a than d2 antagonist (schotte et al.
1996), and the typical apd thioridazine, which has weak
5-ht2a compared to  xxxg656xxx  antagonism (meltzer et
al. 1989). thioridazine is generally considered to have the
least potential of any of the typical apds to produce eps,
presumably because of its anticholinergic effects.
microdialysis studies have also demonstrated that
atypical apds, including clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone and quetiapine, selectively increase
mpfc but not nac ach release, whereas typical apds
such as haloperidol and thioridazine do not affect ach
release in either region (ichikawa et al. 2002a). this
increase in cortical ach release has been suggested to be
important to the ability of atypical apds to improve some
cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia (meltzer and mcgurk 1999; ichikawa et al. 2002a). we
postulated that  xxxd2511xxx , like ziprasidone, but unlike
thioridazine, would also preferentially increase mpfc
ach efflux. this increase is related to 5-ht2a and d2
antagonism.
thus, the present study investigated the effects of
 xxxd2511xxx , ziprasidone and thioridazine on extracellular
da levels in the mpfc and nac. in addition, the effect
of  xxxd2511xxx  and thioridazine on ach release in both
regions was also determined. we report here that both
 xxxd2511xxx  and ziprasidone preferentially increase extracellular da and ach levels in the mpfc of awake, freely
moving male rats compared to the nac, while thioridazine had no effect on extracellular da and ach levels in
either the mpfc or nac. moreover, like atypical apds,
the  xxxd2511xxx -induced da release in the mpfc was
inhibited by way100635, a  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist,
as has previously been reported for ziprasidone (rollema
et al. 2000).

was 3.0 mm, according to the atlas of paxinos and watson (1986).
the length of exposed dialyzing membrane was 2 mm.
three to 5 days after cannulation, a dialysis probe was
implanted into the mpfc and nac under slight anesthesia with
 xxxd2604xxx  ( xxxd2604xxx ; pitman-moore, mundelein, ill., usa).
three hours after the perfusion at 1.5 l/min of the probe, dialysate
samples were collected every 30 min for measuring dialysate ach
concentration. for measuring dialysate da concentration, dialysate
samples were collected every 30 min at 0.4 l/min after the
overnight perfusion at 0.4 l/min of the probe. the perfusion
medium was dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline solution (sigma, st louis, mo., usa) including ca2+ (138 mm nacl, 8.1 mm
na2hpo4, 2.7 mm kcl, 1.5 mm kh2po4, 0.5 mm mgcl, 1.2 mm
cacl2, ph 7.4). after stable baseline values in the dialysates were
obtained, each drug or vehicle was administered to the rats. the
locations of the dialysis probes were verified at the end of each
experiment by brain dissection. the procedures applied in these
experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and
use committee of vanderbilt university in nashville, where we
completed the present studies.

the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee
of vanderbilt university. “principles of laboratory animal care”
(nih publication no. 85-23, revised 1985) were followed.

rats were anesthetized with an ip injection of a combination of
xylazine (6 mg/kg; rompun, shawnee mission, kan., usa) and
ketamine hydrochloride (70 mg/kg ketaset; fort dodge laboratories, fort dodge, iowa, usa) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame
(stoetling, wood dale, ill., usa). stainless guide cannula (21gauge) with a dummy probe were placed and fixed by cranioplastic

the method has been described previously (ichikawa et al. 2002a).
in brief, dialysate samples are directly injected onto the liquid
chromatography/electrochemistry (lcec) system assisted by a
chromatography manager (millennium; waters), and analyzed for
ach. ach is separated on a coiled cation exchanger ach column
(analytical column) (sepstik 10 mm id 5301.0 nm; bas),
followed by the post-imer (immobilized enzyme reactor) (bas)
which consists of choline oxidase (cho)/acetylcholine esterase
(achesterase). ach is hydrolyzed by achesterase to form acetate
and choline in the post-imer, and then choline is oxidized by cho
to produce betaine and  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2). h2o2 is detected
and reduced to h2o on a unijet amperometric detector cell with a
peroxidase-redox-coated glassy carbon electrode (mf-9080; bas),
set at +100 mv (lc-4c; bas) versus ag/agcl reference electrode.
this reduction is analyzed with the detector (lc-4c; bas) as
signal indicating ach in the chromatogram.

one another and greater than those produced by the lower
doses.  xxxd2511xxx , at all doses studied, produced relatively
small, non-significantly different increases in extracellular da levels in the nac. for comparison, the effects of
clozapine on da release in the mpfc and nac
previously reported from our group are also presented
(fig. 1b; kuroki et al. 1999). the atypical apd,
ziprasidone, at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg significantly
increased extracellular da levels in the mpfc, whereas
only the high dose of ziprasidone (1, but not 0.1 or 0.3,
mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular da levels in
the nac (fig. 1c). unlike  xxxd2511xxx , the increase
produced by ziprasidone was not dose-dependent. however, the typical apd, thioridazine, at doses of 5 and
20 mg/kg, had no effect on extracellular da levels in
either the mpfc or nac (fig. 1d).
as previously reported (ichikawa et al. 2001),
way100635 (0.2 mg/kg) by itself had no significant
effect on da release in the mpfc. however, the increase
in da release in the mpfc produced by  xxxd2511xxx  (0.3 mg/
kg) was significantly attenuated by way100635 (0.2 mg/
kg, fig. 2).

basal levels
basal extracellular da levels (mean€sem) obtained from
all rats used in this study were 0.99€0.56 fmol/10 l for
the mpfc (n=62), and 5.93€0.33 for the nac (n=71),
respectively. basal dialysate ach levels in the absence of
achesterase inhibition were 7.45€0.55 (fmol/10 ml) in the
mpfc (n=154), 6.25€1.26 in the nac (n=73), respectively. there was no significant difference in basal
extracellular da and ach levels within the same brain
region, between the various treatment groups.

 xxxd2511xxx  (0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) preferentially

increased da release from 0.03 mg/kg up to 3 mg/kg in a
dose-dependent manner. the increases in extracellular
da levels in the mpfc produced by  xxxd2511xxx , at the doses
of 3 and 10 mg/kg, were not significantly different from
groups (dose) (n=7). analysis of the %net-auc (area under the
curve) for 180 min following drug injections indicate that  xxxd2511xxx ,
from 0.03 to 3 mg/kg, dose-dependently increased the %net-auc
in the mpfc (*p<0.05, 0.03 versus 0.3 mg/kg group; *p<0.05, 0.3
versus 1 mg/kg group; *p<0.05, 1 versus 3 mg/kg group). at 3 and
10 mg/kg,  xxxd2511xxx  produced equal increase in the %net-auc in
the mpfc (p>0.05). ziprasidone (0.1–3 mg/kg) produced significant increases in the %net-auc in the mpfc and nac (*p<0.05
compared to vehicle groups). however, the increase produced by
ziprasidone was not dose-dependent. thioridazine had no effect on

fig. 3 the effects of  xxxd2511xxx  (a), clozapine (b), ziprasidaone (c)
and thioridazine (d) on extracellular ach levels in the mpfc in the
absence of achesterase inhibition.  xxxd2511xxx , at 3 mg/kg in the
absence of achesterase inhibition, significantly increased extracellular ach levels in the mpfc [f(1,9)=11.02, p=0.009]
compared with vehicle group (n=5). at 1 mg/kg,  xxxd2511xxx  showed
trend to increase ach release in the mpfc, although the difference
did not reach significance [f(1,8)=3.94, p=0.082] (n=7) (a).
however, thioridazine had no effect on extracellular ach levels in

the mpfc at both high and low doses [f(1,10)=0.22, p=0.624, n=6
and f(1,12)=0.75, p=0.356; n=6–8, (d)]. the effect of clozapine
(b) and ziprasidone (c) are given for comparison purpose
(ichikawa et al. 2002a). clozapine increases ach release in the
mpfc at 5 and 20 mg/kg (b). ziprasidone (c), only at high dose
3 mg/kg, produced a significant increase in extracellular ach
release in the mpfc. data are means€sem of the dialysate ach
levels, expressed as a percentage of each predrug baseline ach
value

produced large, identical increases in ach release in the
mpfc. ziprasidone, 1 and 3 mg/kg, produced increases in
ach release comparable to  xxxd2511xxx  3 mg/kg.

effect of  xxxd2511xxx 

discussion
the major findings in this study are that: 1)  xxxd2511xxx , at
doses from 0.03–10 mg/kg, preferentially increased
extracellular da levels in the mpfc compared to the
nac; 2) way100635 (0.2 mg/kg) inhibited  xxxd2511xxx 
(0.3 mg/kg)-induced da release in the mpfc; 3)  xxxd2511xxx 
(3 mg/kg) significantly increased ach release in the
mpfc; 4) ziprasidone preferentially increased da release
in the mpfc compared to the nac; 5) thioridazine did
not increase extracellular da and ach levels in either the
mpfc or the nac.

the  xxxd2511xxx -induced preferential increase in da release
in the mpfc compared to the nac, blockade of this
increase by pretreatment with way100635, and the
increase in ach release in the mpfc, are all consistent
with the hypothesis that  xxxd2511xxx  could be considered as
an atypical apd albeit, like risperidone (yamada et al.
2002), one which can produce significant eps when the
dose is raised to the point where it produces more than
80% occupancy of striatal d2 receptors. the findings with
ziprasidone, and thioridazine are consistent with the
classification of these drugs as atypical and typical apds,
respectively. it is noteworthy that the increase in da in
the mpfc occurred at both low and high doses of
 xxxd2511xxx . thus, the higher extent of  xxxg656xxx  blockade
produced by the higher doses of  xxxd2511xxx  dose not prevent
the increase in da release in the mpfc. this result is
consistent with findings with the combination of clozapine and haloperidol (meltzer and ichikawa, unpublished

321

data) and with the effect of sr43469b and haloperidol, a
drug with 5-ht2c as well as 5-ht2a antagonism (bonacorso et al. 2002), but in contrast with the effect of
m100907 and haloperidol (liegeois et al. 2002). it may
be that some 5-ht2c antagonism is needed to overcome
the effects of more complete blockade of d2 receptors,
with regard to the ability of the atypical apds to increase
mpfc da release, as proposed by reavill et al. (1999).
 xxxd2511xxx  is as potent a 5-ht2c as d2 antagonist, in vitro
(table 1). however, 5-ht2c antagonism is not sufficient,
even combined with  xxxg656xxx  affinity, to distinguish
typical and atypical apds (roth et al. 1992). we have
demonstrated that ritanserin, a 5-ht2a/2c antagonist, can
overcome low- but not high-dose haloperidol-induced
catalepsy (bligh-glover et al. 1995). these preclinical
results suggest that  xxxd2511xxx , even at higher doses at
which it produces eps, might be able to produce
improvement in cognition, negative symptoms and depression, if, indeed, increased mpfc da is the basis, at
least in part, for the ability of drugs like clozapine and
risperidone to improve these components of schizophrenia.
as noted above, low dose  xxxd2511xxx , at 35–50 mg/
day, has been reported to produce significant improvement in psychopathology with minimal eps (moore et al.
1975; seeman 1981; meltzer and jayathilake 1999),
whereas higher doses produced eps comparable to
typical neuroleptic drugs (depaulo and ayd 1982;
meltzer and jayathilake 1999). risperidone produces
minimal eps in most patients at doses <4–5 mg/day,
while producing eps comparable to haloperidol at doses
>8 mg/day (marder and meibach 1994). thus, high dose
 xxxd2511xxx , like high dose risperidone, might be expected to
produce significant eps, and, thus, to lack this characteristic feature of atypical apds at these doses; however,
they would still be expected to be like atypical apds with
regard to these other important clinical dimensions.
 xxxd2511xxx  produces catalepsy, at a dose of 0.25 to about
2 mg/kg (costall and naylor 1973; kalkman et al. 1998).
this is the same dose range in which  xxxd2511xxx  increases
mpfc da but not ach release. at these doses,  xxxd2511xxx 
produces  xxxg656xxx  blockade equivalent to 5-ht2a
receptor blockade, which suggests that at least for this
agent, extensive  xxxg656xxx  blockade does not affect its
ability to increase cortical da release. the mechanism of
 xxxd2511xxx  to increase extracellular da levels preferentially
in the mpfc is similar to that of atypical apds because
this increase is partially reversed by way100635, a  xxxg1108xxx  receptor antagonist. it has been reported that the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist r(+)-8-oh-dpat increased da release in
the mpfc (tanda et al 1994; kuroki et al. 1996; rollema
et al. 2000; ichikawa et al. 2001) and this increase, as
expected, is also abolished by way 100635 (sakaue et
al. 2000; ichikawa et al. 2001). thus, the increase in da
release in the mpfc may be due to increased stimulation
of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors or non-selective effects
in the mpfc at higher doses of r(+)-8-oh-dpat.
however,  xxxd2511xxx  does not have significant affinity for
5-ht1a receptors (roth et al. 1994). thus, the increase in

da release in the mpfc by  xxxd2511xxx  probably is not due
to the direct effects on 5-ht1a receptors.
7-hydroxyloxapine, a major metabolite of  xxxd2511xxx  in
humans, has 5 times higher affinity for the  xxxg656xxx 
than  xxxd2511xxx  (coupet and rauh 1979). production of
significant amounts of this metabolite may contribute to
the eps following high dose  xxxd2511xxx  (stockmeier et al.
1993). in addition,  xxxd160xxx , another metabolite of
 xxxd2511xxx , which has pharmacologic properties that would
predict antipsychotic activity of the atypical type (kapur
and zipursky 1998), may contribute to the efficacy and
side effect profile of  xxxd2511xxx .  xxxd160xxx  produces
greater 5-ht2 than  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and caused
increased incidence of eps only when  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy exceeds 80% (kapur and zipursky 1998).
since low and high doses of  xxxd2511xxx  have similar
effects on cortical da release, but only low dose  xxxd2511xxx 
does not produce eps, it is clear that low dose  xxxd2511xxx  is
preferable to high dose for the treatment of schizophrenia.
 xxxd2511xxx  should be further tested to determine if it
improves cognition in patients with schizophrenia. the
finding reported here that  xxxd2511xxx  increases da and ach
release in the mpfc, suggests it should improve cognition, regardless of dose.
effect of ziprasidone
the pharmacological profile of ziprasidone includes
relatively more potent 5-ht2a than d2 antagonism as
well as potent 5-ht1a partial agonism (schotte et al.
1996; newman-tancredi et al. 1998; sprouse et al. 1999).
it has been considered to be an atypical apd because it
produces very low eps at clinically effective doses (goff
et al. 1998; keck jr et al. 1998). it also does not increase
serum prolactin levels (carnahan et al. 2001). the present
data, in agreement with previous data (rollema et al.
2000), indicate that ziprasidone is similar to other known
atypical apds with regard to a preferential increase in
da and ach release in the mpfc versus the nac
(rollema et al. 2000, ichikawa et al. 2002a). the increase
in mpfc da release is partially inhibited by pretreatment
with way 100635 (rollema et al. 2000), suggesting that
5-ht1a agonism contributes to the increase in da release
in the mpfc.
a large group of drugs which preferentially block 5ht2a compared to d2 receptors increase ach release in
the rat mpfc (ichikawa et al. 2002a). the combination of
m100907, a 5-ht2a antagonist, and low but not high
doses of haloperidol increases da release in the mpfc
(leigeois et al. 2002). however, since the combination of
m100907, or sr46349-b, a 5-ht2a/2c antagonist, with
low or high dose haloperidol, does not increase mpfc
ach release (bonaccorso et al. 2002; ichikawa et al.
2002c), combined 5-ht2a and  xxxg656xxx  blockade is
insufficient to enhance mpfc ach release. way100635
does not block the increase in ach release produced by
these agents, except for quetiapine (ichikawa et al.

322

2002b). further studies are needed to determine the
pharmacologic basis for this increase.
effect of thioridazine
thioridazine produces lower eps than other typical
neuroleptic drugs. this characteristic has been attributed
to its anticholinergic properties (miller and hiley 1976).
unlike clozapine, or quetiapine, thioridazine produces
marked increases in serum prolactin levels (meltzer et al.
1975) and severe worsening of the motor symptoms of
parkinson’s disease, even at very low doses, when given
to patients with parkinson’s disease because of l-dopainduced psychosis (scholz and dichgans 1985). present
data indicated that thioridazine at both low and high doses
has no effect on da or ach release in either mpfc or
nac. the negative data for thioridazine with regard to
the release of cortical and nac da and ach are
consistent with the clinical evidence that it is a typical
neuroleptic drug. together, the data from these two drugs
provide further evidence that the increased release of da
and ach in the mpfc can distinguish between atypical
and typical apd, at least those that share potent 5-ht2a
and weak  xxxg656xxx  antagonism. drugs with some
atypical properties, e.g. benzamide antipsychotics (such
as sulpiride), which ared2/ xxxg657xxx  antagonists, do not
produce increases in da or ach release in the mpfc
(ichikawa et al. 2002b).
conclusion
the present study demonstrates that systemic administration of  xxxd2511xxx  preferentially increases da and ach
release in the mpfc compared to the nac, identical to
the profile produced by known atypical apds.  xxxd2511xxx 
has traditionally been considered to be a typical apd, but
the data reported here suggest that it might behave more
like an atypical apd with regard to ability to improve
cognition and negative symptoms throughout the clinical
dose range, although only at low doses will it produce the
sine qua non of aytpical apds, low eps in patients with
schizophrenia.
