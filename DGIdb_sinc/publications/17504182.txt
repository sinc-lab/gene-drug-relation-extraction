abstract: objective: to review the main pharmacological properties and clinical applications of the drugs used in the medical therapy of
cushing’s syndrome.
data sources: search for articles were performed in the following dababases: medline, embase, cochrane database of systematic
reviews and the cochrane central register of controlled trials (central). search terms included cushing’s syndrome and drug
therapy.
data synthesis: available data suggest that neuromodulatory compounds affect corticotropin (acth) or acth-releasing hormone
(crh) synthesis and release. they include serotonin antagonists, dopaminergic agonists,  xxxd3485xxx , reserpine, somatostatin analogs
and thiazolidinediones. these agents have been effective in a limited number of patients with acth-dependent cushing’s syndrome. inhibitors of steroidogenesis reduce cortisol production by blocking one ( xxxd2633xxx ,  xxxd3436xxx ) or several ( xxxd147xxx , ketoconazole, fluconazole, etomidate) enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis.  xxxd2656xxx  is a steroidogenesis inhibitor with adrenolitic properties.
 xxxd2643xxx 'e blocks  xxxg1601xxx  activation without modifying cortisol synthesis.
conclusion: agents that inhibit steroidogenesis are useful in all forms of cushing’s syndrome and are effective in about 70% of patients.
main indications for drug therapy include preparation for surgery, persistence or recurrence after surgery, while awaiting for the effect of
radiation therapy, occult ectopic acth syndrome, severe hypercortisolism and malignancy related hypercortisolism.

key words: cushing’s syndrome, drug therapy, cortisol, corticotropin.
introduction

table 1.

endogenous cushing’s syndrome results from prolonged exposure to excessive circulating glucocorticoids. consequences of hypercortisolism include central obesity, plethora, round face, hirsutism, thin skin, myopathy, osteoporosis, increased tissue fragility,
poor wound healing, hypertension, diabetes and psychiatric symptoms [1]. cushing’s syndrome can be separated into  xxxg1801xxx  (acth)-dependent and acth-independent categories (table 1). the term cushing’s disease is used to refer to an acthsecreting pituitary adenoma. it is the main cause of endogenous
hypercortisolism, representing about 65-75% of patients. a variety
of nonpituitary tumors are capable of ectopic secretion of  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc)-derived peptides. such tumors account
for 10-20% of patients with cushing’s syndrome. only a few cases
of ectopic acth releasing hormone (crh)-secreting tumors have
been reported [1,2]. benign or malignant adrenocortical tumors are
the most common cause of acth-independent cushing’s syndrome (5-20%). primary pigmented nodular adrenal dysplasia (micronodular adrenal hyperplasia) and macronodular adrenal hyperplasia account for a small percentage of patients with acthindependent cushing’s syndrome. rare causes of acth-independent cushing syndrome include the excess secretion of cortisol
by abnormal adrenal expression and function of receptors for various hormones, including gastric inhibitory polypeptide, vasopressin,
-adrenergic agonists, interleukin-1 and  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx /human
 xxxd2228xxx  and serotonin [3,4].
the aims of treatment in patiens with cushing’s syndrome are
to reverse the clinical manifestations by reducing cortisol secretion,
erradicate any tumor, avoid permanent dependence upon medications and permanent hormone deficiency [1]. the morbidity and
mortality associated with cushing’s syndrome and the limitation of
current surgery and irradiation therapies highlight the need for the
medical therapy. furthermore, metabolic derangements of the syndrome, and the consequent increase in the risk of surgery, can be
efficiently reversed using medical therapy. drugs may act either by
inhibiting acth release at pituitary or ectopic level, inhibiting

methods
all articles related to medical therapy of cushing’s syndrome
were searched in medline from 1964 to 2006. search was performed by using the term “cushing syndrome/drug therapy” as a
subheading of the term cushing syndrome in the mesh thesaurus.
another search was performed in embase from 1980 to 2006
with the heading cushing syndrome and the subheading drug therapy. all clinical trials and systematic reviews related to cushing’s
syndrome were also searched at the cochrane database of systematic reviews and the cochrane central register of controlled
trials (central). the selection criteria included all prospective
and retrospective studies, all case series, all case reports, and reviews concerning the effects of pharmacological agents on patients
with any form or cushing’ syndrome.

neuromodulators of acth release
serotonin antagonists
pharmacological properties
 xxxd1785xxx  is a nonselective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor
blocking agent that also have histamine, cholinergic and dopamine
antagonistic properties (fig. 2) [5,6].  xxxd1785xxx  reduced basal
and insulin or  xxxd2633xxx -stimulated acth secretion by suppressing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation [5,7-13]. furthermore, some studies suggest that  xxxd1785xxx  may have a
direct pituitary action [10,12].
daily recommended dose of  xxxd1785xxx  is 24 mg [6,14].
ritanserin (fig. 2) has been used at daily doses of 10-15 mg and
 xxxd2419xxx  at 40-80 mg. hyperphagia and weight gain are frequent
in patients treated with  xxxd1785xxx . other adverse effects include somnolence, dry mouth and effects derived of histamine h1
antagonism.

clinical applications
several case reports have documented that  xxxd1785xxx 
treatment induced remission in patients with cushing’s disease after
unsuccessful treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy [7,11,1520]. prolonged remission of a case of cushing's disease following
cessation of  xxxd1785xxx  therapy has also been reported [21]. in
a non-controlled study in 3 patients with cushing’s disease, the
administration of  xxxd1785xxx , 24 mg daily, over a period of
three to six months was associated with prompt and sustained clinical and laboratory remission [6]. in 2 patients with cushing’s disease, absence of tumor evidence at magnetic resonance imaging,
and a hyperpulsatile cortisol secretory pattern, chronic treatment
with  xxxd1785xxx  resulted in sustained clinical and biochemical
improvement and normalization of the median of absolute and relative increments in cortisol peaks [14]. these results suggest that
patients with cushing's disease who are characterized by a hyperpulsatile cortisol secretory pattern and in whom no pituitary lesion
can be identified by magnetic resonance imaging,  xxxd1785xxx 
treatment may be useful.

efectiveness of  xxxd1785xxx  treatment has also been reported in some patients with nelson’s syndrome [22]. some authors
have suggested that in patients with nelson’s syndrome or previously treated cushing’s disease,  xxxd1785xxx  might decrease
acth levels in up to 70% of the cases [10,23,24]. however this
figure seems to be exaggerated, since some clinical reports have
documented a remission of cushing’s disease [7,11,15-19], whereas
in others no significant effects were observed [25-30].

pharmacological therapy of cushing’s syndrome

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

 xxxd1785xxx  has been used in childhood to avoid pituitary
surgery [17,30] and in cushing’s syndrome during pregnancy [31].
others selective serotoninergic antagonists, such as metergoline
[25,32,33] and ritanserin [34] have been employed in the treatment
of a limited number of patients with cushing’s disease. a study
using ritanserin or  xxxd2419xxx  in 11 patients with cushing’s disease
found that responses were sustained in only 3 patients [35].
dopaminergic agents
pharmacological properties
bromocriptine, a lysergic acid derivative, is a dopaminergic
agonist with capacity to bind d2 receptors (fig. 3). daily doses of
bromocriptine have ranged from 2.5 to 30 mg in patients with
cushing’s disease. responsive patients usually need higher doses
than those used in the therapy of prolactinomas. doses as high as 55
mg/day have been also reported [36]. nausea, vomiting, dry mouth,
nasal congestion, and postural hypotension are the most frequent
adverse effects. dyskinesia, constipation, vasomotor phenomena,
eritromelalgia and psychiatric disorders may occur with long-term
therapy.

an acute dose of bromocriptine fails to identify the patients who
would benefit from long-term dopaminergic treatment [39,49,5153].
a placebo-controlled study showed that bromocriptine was not
more effective than placebo in the acute reduction of serum cortisol
in patients with cushing’ disease [55]. in a three-month noncontolled trial, invitti et al. [56] showed that monthly 50-100 mg
injections of a bromocriptine depot preparation did not consistently
influence pituitary-adrenal activity, as judged by plasma acth,
cortisol and urinary free cortisol levels, in a small group of 6 patients with cushing’s disease. other dopamine agonists do not seem
to be more effective, although some authors have suggested that
cabergoline (fig. 3) may have significant respones rates [57].
 xxxd3485xxx 
pharmacological properties
sodium valproate ( xxxd3485xxx , fig. 4), a gammaaminobutyric acid (gaba)-transaminase inhibitor, increases endogenous concentrations of gaba, a neurotransmitter involved in
the glucocorticoid negative feedback mechanisms at hypothalamic
level. the mechanism of the inhibition of acth secretion by valproate might involve a gaba-induced decrease in the production
of crh or a direct action on the pituitary tumor cells [58].

clinical applications
initial clinical studies suggested that bromocriptine administration were followed by an acute suppression of acth secretion in
some patients with cushing’ disease or nelson syndrome [37-39].
isolated case reports have showed long-term clinical and biochemical remission while on bromocriptine therapy in patients with
acth-dependent cushing’s syndrome [40-42], while others have
showed a lack of effect of this treatment [25,43]. in a small series of
patients bromocriptine was effective in 2 patients and ineffective in
4 patients with cushing’s disease [26]. some authors have reported
successful results of bromocriptine treatment in patients with cyclic
cushing’s disease [44-47] and reduction of pituitary tumor size
[41]. other reports have showed variable results and only a moderate effectiveness of bromocriptine in the treatment of cushing’s
disease [39,48-54]. therefore it seems possible that some acthsecreting pituitary tumors have or may acquire responsiveness to
dopaminergic agents [42]. unfortunately, biochemical response to

recommended dose of sodium valproate is 200 mg thrice a day
[18,59], although daily doses of 1000 mg [60] and 1200 mg [61]
have been used. nausea, vomiting and anorexia are the most frequent side effects. other reported adverse effects are sedation, ataxia,
tremor, rash, hepatotoxicity, alopecia and increase in appetite
[18,59].
clinical applicatons
sodium valproate is known to induce a decrease of plasma
acth in some patients with nelson’s syndrome [58,62], although
there is no evidence of the efficacy of the drug in inducing reduction in tumor size [63]. an unique oral dose of 200-400 mg sodium
valproate did not induce changes in acth and cortisol levels in 11
patients with cushing’s disease and 3 patients with nelson’s syndrome [60].
medical treatment with sodium valproate induced long-term
hypocorticism in a patient with persistent cushing’s disease after
transfrontal hypophysectomy [64]. other case reports of isolated
patients with cushing’s disease responsive to sodium valproate
have been reported [18,59,64-67]. in a series of 13 patients with

470

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

cushing’s disease, only two cases were responsive to sodium valproate treatment [54]. long-term treatment (3 weeks-9 months) was
ineffective in 2 patients with active cushing’s disease and in 1 patient with nelson’s syndrome [60]. in a study performed in 19 patients with cushing’s syndrome, sodium valproate, 600 mg/day for
3 months, did not induce normalization of acth or cortisol levels
and/or clinical remission [68].
reserpine
reserpine acts by depleting cathecolamine and serotonine storages (fig. 4). a direct inhibitory effect of reserpine on the secretion
of acth and -endorphin from the pituitary of patients with cushing's disease has been reported [69]. murayama et al. [70] reported
that 11 out of 20 patients with cushing's disease treated with reserpine for a mean of 24 months, daily dose 1-2 mg, in combination
with a single course of external pituitary irradiation experienced
long term remissions. there were no differences in remission rates
in patients classified according to the dose of radiation.
the effects of reserpine treatment, not associated with pituitary
irradiation, were also examined in untreated patients with cushing's
disease [71]. long-term treatment (mean dose 1.7 mg per day,
mean duration 15.8 weeks) induced a marked reduction in plasma
cortisol, and 24-hour urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and/or free
cortisol in 4 of 8 examined patients. plasma acth response to
crh was evidently decreased in one patient evaluated one month
after the initiation of reserpine.
somatostatin analogues
pharmacological properties
the mechanism of action of somatostatin analogues, octreotide
and  xxxd2443xxx  (fig. 5), in patients with acth hypersecretion is not
well understood. tyrrell et al. [72] demonstrated that somatostatin

díez and iglesias

effect of octreotide on acth responses to crh has also been reported in 13 patients [75,76]. however, basal and stimulated acth
secretion has been reported to be inhibited by octreotide in human
corticotropic adenoma cell cultures in vitro [77]. it has been suggested the presence of somatostatin receptors in human corticotropic adenomas [78,79], although the fact that octreotide has no
suppressive effect on acth levels of patients with cushing's disease in vivo suggests that cortisol might exert a somatostatin receptor down-regulation in vivo.
studies in vivo have shown that somatostatin and its analogue
octreotide do not inhibit acth secretion in normal subjects [80]
and in patients with acth secreting pituitary adenomas [74,77].
on the contrary, in patients with ectopic acth secretion chronic
therapy with octreotide is accompanied by a decrease in acth
production [81-85]. this action seems to be induced by interaction
with somatostatin receptors, mainly subtypes 2 and 5 [86-88]. a
recent study has shown that human corticotroph tumors express
somatostatin receptors subtypes 1, 2, 4 and 5, and that  xxxd2852xxx 
( xxxd2852xxx ), a new somatostatin analogue with affinity to receptors
subtypes 5, 2, 3 and 1, inhibited acth secretion in five out of six
cultured tumors [89].
some authors have also suggested a temporary inhibitory effect
of somatostatin analogues on adrenal steroidogenesis in patients
with cushing’s disease [90]. in gip-dependent cushing’s syndrome, octreotide temporarily suppressed meal-induced gip release, thereby suppressing gip-induced cortisol secretion [91].
half life of octreotide after subcutaneous injection is short and
it has to be administered 3-4 times a day. in patients with cushing’s
syndrome the range of used doses has been wide (100-1500
g/day). dose has to be modified according to the clinical and hormonal responses. slow release  xxxd2443xxx  has been used at 30 mg
every 21 days [92]. the most commonly found adverse effects of
somatostatin analogues are abdominal discomfort, loose stools or
diarrhoea, mild malabsortion, flatulence, nausea and pain at the
injection site in patients receiving the depot formulations. the development of cholesterol gallstones is the most serious adverse
effect of somatostatin analogues [93].

infusion in patients with nelson’s syndrome resulted in a sustained,
progressive fall in plasma acth to 40% to 71% of basal value
with a return to initial levels after cessation of the infusion. a fall in
plasma acth was also observed during the infusion of somatostatin to patients with adrenal insufficiency [73]. a single dose of
octreotide was followed by no respone in baseline acth concentration in 18 patients with cushing’s disease [74-76]. an absence of

initial clinical studies demonstrated the effectiveness of octreotide in the management of patients with ectopic acth secretion
[74,81,85,94-96]. a stabilization or even reduction in tumor volume
has also been reported [81]. further studies have confirmed initial
results in patients with ectopic acth secretion [76,84,90,97,98],
although some authors have reported negative results [99,100] or
variable responsiveness to octreotide [101]. in summary, a review
of patients with the ectopic acth syndrome showed that an acute
response to octretide has been observed in 24 of 38 patients with
the ectopic acth syndrome [102]. a prolonged response to octreotide, defined as persistent decrease in serum cortisol, cortisoluria or plasma acth of greater than 30% for more than 3 months,
has been reported in 10 of 14 cases [82]. it has been suggested that
a response to a short trial of octreotide in patients with acthdependent cushing’s syndrome who have no demonstrable pituitary
tumor should alert to the possibility of an ectopic acth source and
might identify patients whose disease may be controllable using
octreotide [76].
in patients with cushing’s disease the effectiveness of somatostatin analogues has been debatable [74,75,90]. in two of four
patients normalization of acth levels was achieved with octreotide treatment [103]. however, most of the investigators did not
report significant effects of acth secretion [74,76]. somatostatin
analogues seem to inhibit pathological acth secretion in nelson’s
syndrome. chronic therapy with octreotide in patients with nelson’s syndrome has been reported to reduce circulanting acth
levels [74] and tumor size [104] in a few patients.

pharmacological therapy of cushing’s syndrome

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

somatostatin receptor scintigraphy may be useful in patients
with acth-dependent cushing’s syndrome [105]. the use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogues, such as 111in-pentetreotide, has
allowed the location of acth-secreting tumors with somatostatin
receptors [83,86]. it has been suggested that patients with ectopic
acth syndrome who exhibit a positive pentetreotide scanning and
are responsive to an acute dose of octreotide may be treated with the
new sustained release formulations of somatostatin analogues [92].
a patient with metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma who
showed clinical and biochemical improvement after octreotide therapy has been reported [106]. however, these results have not been
confirmed by other authors [107].
thiazolidinediones
pharmacological properties
thiazolidinediones are peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar)- agonists. the ppar- is a member of the nuclear
receptor superfamily and function as a transcription factor. activation of ppar- is followed by several biological effects on adipogenesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, inflammation processes and cell proliferation. ppar- agonists, such as rosiglitazone
and pioglitazone (fig. 6), are a new group of oral antidiabetic
agents recently introduced in the therapy of type 2 diabetes. these
drugs are insulin sensitizers that reduce insulin resistance, increase
glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue and decrease hepatic
glucose production [108]. heaney et al. [109] demonstrated that
ppar- was abundantly expressed in normal acth-secreting human anterior pituitary cells and in human acth-secreting pituitary
tumors. ppar- activation induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
and suppressed acth secretion in human and murine acth tumor
cells. in addition, rosiglitazone abolished basal and crh-induced
pomc transcription in mouse corticotroph pituitary tumor cells
[109]. a direct effect of rosiglitazone on the steroidogenic enzymes
 xxxg573xxx  and 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been proven by
in vitro studies [110].

471

no significant changes in plasma acth, serum cortisol, urinary free cortisol and acth and cortisol responses to crh were
observed after 30 days of treatment with pioglitazone, 45 mg/day,
in five patients with cushing’s disease [114]. further studies are
required to clarify the effectiveness of different doses of thiazolidinediones in patients with cushing’s syndrome.
steroidogenesis inhibitors
 xxxd2633xxx 
pharmacological properties
 xxxd2633xxx , 2-methyl-1,2-bis-[3-piridyl]-1-propanone (fig. 7),
is a pyridine derivative widely used in the differential diagnosis of
cushing’s syndrome and in the assessment of the integrity of the
pituitary-adrenal axis [115,116].  xxxd2633xxx  acts on cytochrome
p450 dependent enzymatic system by blocking 11-hydroxilase
( xxxg571xxx ), thus inhibiting conversion of 11-deoxycortisol in cortisol. 11-hydroxilase blockade also inhibits aldosterone biosynthesis
[116]. an inhibition of acth secretion by high doses of  xxxd2633xxx  has also been reported [117].

clinical applications
hull et al. [111] reported on the effect of rosiglitazone administration in two patients with cushing’s disease. the drug induced a
significant decrease in early morning cortisol to creatinine ratio
without significant clinical improvement during 20-33 days of therapy. no normalization of hormonal values or reduction in tumor
size was observed. a reduction of acth and cortisol levels and a
normalization of urinary free cortisol 30-60 days after the beginning
of rosiglitazone administration was observed in 6 out of 14 patients
with cushing’ disease [112]. immunohistochemical analysis of
pituitary tumors removed from two responder and two nonresponder patients showed a similar intense immunoreactivity for ppar-
in about 50% of cells. long-term efficacy in some of these patients,
as well as escape phenomenon have been reported [113].

 xxxd2633xxx  has been used at a daily dose ranging between 500
mg and 6 g in divided doses. the fall in cortisol is rapid, with nadir
levels at 2 hours post dose. doses needed to control hypercortisolemia are higher in patients with ectopic acth secretion than in
patients with cushing’s disease or adrenal adenomas [118]. nausea,
vomiting, skin rash, ataxia, lethargy, dizziness, vertigo and edema
are side effects associated to  xxxd2633xxx  therapy. incidence of
these side effects decreases with daily doses lower than 2 g [119].
inhibition of 11-hydroxylase by  xxxd2633xxx  coupled with increased acth levels causes increased androgenic and mineralocorticoid precursors. this effect may impair hypertension and hirsutism in women [120]. combined therapy with ketoconazole may
overcome this inconvenience. the increase in 11-deoxycortisol
induced by  xxxd2633xxx  is reflected in the urine 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. urine and serum cortisol should be used to monitor therapy. a strict control of cortisol levels is mandatory under  xxxd2633xxx  treatment, since this drug, as other glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, may induce hypoadrenalism. furthermore,  xxxd2633xxx 
is a hepatic enzymatic inductor and may induce hypertensive crisis
in some patients [121].
clinical applications
the clinical usefulness of this drug has been well characterized
by different authors [118,120,122,123].  xxxd2633xxx  has been used
in the prolonged treatment of patients with cushing’s syndrome due
to adrenal tumors [118,124], ectopic acth secretion [118,123-

472

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

díez and iglesias

126] and acth-secreting pituitary adenomas [118,120,121,127,
128].
in patients with cushing’s disease the clinical features of the
disease rapidly improve on  xxxd2633xxx  treatment. reduction of
cortisol levels in these patients may induce an increase in pituitary
acth secretion [118,120,122,127,128]. in a summary of several
studies including 83 patients with cushing’s syndrome,  xxxd2633xxx , in combination with radiation therapy or other drugs,
normalized plasma cortisol in 74% and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids
in 75% of the patients [129].

 xxxd3436xxx 
 xxxd3436xxx , 4,5-epoxy-17-hydroxy-3-oxo-5-androstane-2carbonitrile (fig. 7), is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [130]. in vitro, the drug inhibits
conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. in rats  xxxd3436xxx  inhibits corticosterone and aldosterone production and elevates circulating levels of pregnenolone at doses lower than those that produce
adrenal hypertrophy or inhibit gonadal steroidogenesis [130]. daily
doses of  xxxd3436xxx  in patients with cushing’s syndrome have ranged
from 120 to 1440 mg [131,132]. astenia, abdominal discomfort,
diarrhoea, parestesias and increase in salivary secretion have been
reported during  xxxd3436xxx  treatment. some authors have reported
that  xxxd3436xxx  treatment reduced steroid biosynthesis and improved
biochemical manifestations of the hypercortisolism in patients with
cortisol secreting adrenal tumors and with cushing’s disease
[131,133]. however, these results have not been confirmed by others [132,134]. escape to the effects of  xxxd3436xxx  may occur. although effective in some cases of cushing's syndrome, the variability of the effect of  xxxd3436xxx  may limit its usefulness as a therapeutic agent.
 xxxd2656xxx 
pharmacological properties
 xxxd2656xxx , ortho,para-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane (o,p'ddd, fig. 8), is a compound with a chemical structure similar to
the insecticide ddt. administration of  xxxd2656xxx  to animals was
followed by adrenal gland atrophy, thus calling attention on the
endocrine effects of this drug.  xxxd2656xxx  inhibits cholesterol sidechain cleavage enzyme ( xxxg570xxx ) at adrenal mitochondria [135]. it
acts also as inhibitor of distinct cytochrome p450 depending enzymes, such as 11-hydroxylase ( xxxg571xxx ) and 18-hydroxylase
(p450c11as) and non-cytochrome p450 depending enzymes, such
 xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3hsd) [136]. a particular
property  xxxd2656xxx  is that it exhibits adrenolitic properties [137,138].
it induces mitochondrial degeneration with atrophy and necrosis of
adrenal cortex [139]. the term medical adrenalectomy has been
used to designate this effect of the drug [140,141].  xxxd2656xxx  inhibitory action seems to be more selective in zona fasciculata and zona
reticularis and less selective in zona glomerulosa [139]. an effect
on acth release has also been suggested because patients who
exhibit reduction in their hypercortisolism also may have a decrease
in plasma acth concentrations [138].
 xxxd2656xxx  should be started at 500 mg b.i.d. with progressive
increases as needed to obtain an adequate adrenal suppression (2-4
g per day). the onset of action of  xxxd2656xxx  is slow and beneficial
effects may be delayed between 6 and 8 weeks [137,142]. its halflife is long and it accumulates in adipose tissue and adrenal glands
[143]. the adrenolitic effect of  xxxd2656xxx  on biochemical remission
can last for long time after the drug is stopped. high doses (8-12 g
per day) must be used in cushing’s syndrome due to adrenal carcinoma. to avoid the inconvenience of the delay in the action of  xxxd2656xxx  combined therapy with another inhibitor of cortisol synthesis, such as  xxxd2633xxx , may be used during the first weeks. urinary free cortisol is the best parameter in monitoring therapy with
 xxxd2656xxx . this drug directs extraadrenal metabolism of cortisol to

the production of 6-hydroxycortisol, which is not detected in 17hydroxycorticosteroids measurement [2,137,138].
gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity limits seriously the
use of  xxxd2656xxx  [137]. anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea
are common [142]. adverse reactions observed less frequently are
somnolence, apathy, weakness, ataxia, pruritus, leukopenia, arthralgia, depression and exantema. at higher doses, neurological findings are common and include abnormal gait, dizziness, vertigo,
confusion and problems with language expression.  xxxd2656xxx  is an
enzymatic inductor. this drug produces an increrase in cholesterol
synthesis and an elevation of serum levels of total and ldlcholesterol even when used at low doses [137,144]. treatment with
simvastatin reversed the hyperlipidemia [145]. increased urate excretion may give rise to hypouricemia [146].  xxxd2656xxx  increases
serum levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin
and  xxxg2066xxx . the drug or some of its metabolits may have estrogenic actions and some patients may develop
gynaecomastia [137].
some of the adverse reactions to  xxxd2656xxx  may be in relation to
drug-induced hypoadrenalism.  xxxd2656xxx  accelerates the clearance of
some steroids, such as dexamethasone and fludrocortisone, but not
cortisol or prednisolone. if dexamethasone is used, doses higher
than usual replacement dose are necessary.
clinical applications
 xxxd2656xxx  has been used as medical therapy after surgical treatment in adrenal carcinoma and in inoperable adrenal carcinomas
[140,147,148]. in patients with cushing’s syndrome produced by
adrenal carcinoma,  xxxd2656xxx  induced a reduction in cortisol levels
in up to 75% of patients, and a transient decrease in tumour volume
in 30% of the patients [140,142]. however, these effects have not
been obtained by others [149] and a retrospective analysis of 105
patients showed no benefit of  xxxd2656xxx  on patient survival [142].

pharmacological therapy of cushing’s syndrome

the effectiveness of  xxxd2656xxx  in decreasing cortisol hypersecretion has been demonstrated in patients with cushing’s disease
[43,126,139,150]. low doses of  xxxd2656xxx  (up to 4 g/day) has been
used concurrently with or after pituitary irradiation in patients with
cushing’s disease with remission in 29 out of 36 patients [138].
remission of the disease was obtained in 38 of 46 patients with
cushing’s disease given  xxxd2656xxx  alone and in all 16 patients who
received this drug combined with irradiation [137]. nevertheless,
60% of these patients subsequently relapsed and needed additional
courses of drug or radiation therapy. given the effectiveness of this
treatment, combined therapy with  xxxd2656xxx  and pituitary radiation
has been recommended [2]. long term remission with  xxxd2656xxx 
therapy has been reported in a patient with intractable cushing’s
disease [151]. the incidence of nelson’s syndrome after  xxxd2656xxx 
medical adrenalectomy appears to be lower than that reported after
surgical adrenalectomy. less frequently,  xxxd2656xxx  has been used in
the treatment of ectopic acth syndrome [152].
 xxxd147xxx 
pharmacological properties
 xxxd147xxx  (fig. 8), first used as an anticonvulsant
drug, blocks several cytochrome p450 mediated steroid hydroxylation steps, including those required for conversion of cholesterol to
pregnenolone and for the aromatization of androgens to estrogens.
it blocks adrenal synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone and androgens,
and the production of estrogens in extraglandular tissues. adrenal
glands appear full of lipid drops in a similar way to that found in
the lipoidic form of the congenital adrenal hyperplasia [119]. other
effects of  xxxd147xxx  on adrenal steroidogenesis include
inhibition of other cytochrome p450 enzymes, such as 21hydroxilase, 17-hydroxilase, 11-hydroxilase, c17,20 liase and
18-hydroxilase [153].
recommended daily doses range from 0.5 to 2 g [154-159]. the
agent is begun at a dose of 500 mg daily, in divided doses, and can
be increased by 250 to 500 mg every three to four days. adverse
reactions include drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, letargy,
sedation, depression, somnolence, headache and blurred vision
[154]. a transient morbiliform rash is common in the first two weeks
of therapy. slurred speech and ataxia have been also reported [119].
 xxxd147xxx  reduces iodine uptake capacity by the thyroid
gland, thus a 5% of the patients may exhibit sings of hypothyroidism. this drug accelerates metabolism of dexamethasone, although
not that of cortisol [153].
clinical applications
 xxxd147xxx  was used in the 1960s to inhibit cortisol
secretion in patients with adrenal carcinoma [159] and with acthdependent cushing’s syndrome [160]. this drug provided palliation
from the signs and symptoms of hypercorticism in 13 of 21 patients
with metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma and four of six patients
with ectopic acth production due to metastatic carcinomas. six
patients with adrenal adenomas showed clinical and biochemical
improvement, and 14 out of 33 patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia of pituitary origin improved [154]. some case reports
showed biochemical control of hypercortisolism by  xxxd147xxx  in patients with ectopic acth secretion [161], with failure to obtain clinical improvement [124]. in some cases reduction
in cortisol levels produced an adrenal insufficiency requiring replacement therapy with exogenous glucocorticoids [119,154,162].
it seems to be less efficient in cushing’s disease compared to other
causes of cushing’s syndrome. this may be due to an increase in
acth overcoming the enzymatic blockade, or by hepatic enzyme
induction increasing the drug’s own metabolism [155].
ketoconazole
pharmacological properties
ketoconazole, an imidazole derivative (fig. 8), inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi and cholesterol synthesis in mammal

cells [163]. it reduces adrenal and gonadal androgen biosynthesis
both in vitro and in vivo [164], and also cortisol synthesis [165,
166]. ketoconazole inhibits predominantly c17,20 lyase activity,
which accounts for the inhibitory effect of testosterone production
in man [164,165]. blockade of the cholesterol side chain cleavage
( xxxg570xxx ), 11-hydroxylase ( xxxg571xxx ) and 17-hydroxylase
( xxxg573xxx ) activities gives rise to a decrease in cortisol production.
an inhibition of 18-hydroxylase activity has also been reported
[167].
the effects of ketoconazole on acth secretion is a matter of
debate. some authors [168] have reported an enhanced response of
acth to ovine crh after the administration of ketoconazole.
however, a lack of compensatory increase in acth levels in spite
of significant decreases in cortisol production has also been reported [169-172]. it has been suggested that ketoconazole might
exert a possible glucocorticoid agonistic action at pituitary level,
preventing the expected rise in acth secretion in patients with
cushing's disease [172]. in vitro studies in rat anterior pituitary
fragments and in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells have
demonstrated that ketoconazole inhibits crh-stimulated acth
release in a dose-dependent manner [173,174].
a wide range of doses, 200 to 1200 mg per day, in divided
doses, has been used in patients with cushing’s syndrome.
achlorhydria and antiacid treatments reduce absorption of ketoconazole. ketoconazole is usually well tolerated. the main side
effects are gastrointestinal, and pruritus, occurring in 5-10% of the
patients. less frequently it has been reported the presence of headache, irritability, somnolence, dizziness, fever, photofobia, edema
and rash [169]. in rare cases anaphylaxis has been reported after the
first dose. hypoadrenalism and adrenal crisis have been reported
[175]. inhibition of androgen synthesis may cause erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and gynaecomastia [164,169]. reversible
alterations in hepatic tests is detected in about 10-15% of the patients [176]. severe symptomatic hepatic damage is a rare side effect [169], although some cases of hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome have been reported [177].
clinical applications
in normal subjects ketoconazole reduced cortisol responses to
acth [165]. numerous clinical studies, both short-term [178-180]
and long-term [169,170,172,181], have shown that ketoconazole
administration to patients with cushing’s syndrome is followed by
a rapid reduction of serum and urinary cortisol levels, and by an
improvement in clinical symptoms.
beneficial effects of ketoconazole have been clearly demonstrated in patients with cushing’s disease [43,169-172,176,178,179,
181-185], adrenal tumours [169,172,186,187] and adrenal hyperplasia [167]. in patients with cushing’s disease, ketoconazole normalized plasma cortisol in 69% and urinary cortisol or 17hydroxycorticosteroids in 81% of cases [129]. variable results have
been obtained in patients with ectopic acth secretion [169,178180,184,188-192]. in a series of 15 patients with ectopic acth
syndrome, ketoconazole, 400-1200 mg/day, improved hypokalemia,
metabolic alkalosis, diabetes and hypertension in the majority of
patients. however complete hormonal response was only achieved
in seven patients with a median duration of response of 25 days
[190].
ketoconazole reduced hyperandrogenism and normalized cortisol levels in a case of cushing’s syndrome due to virilizing adrenocortical carcinoma with predominance of the c17,20 pathway
[193]. regression of metastatic adrenal carcinoma during palliative
ketoconazole therapy has also been reported [187]. recently, a
patient with recurrence of cushing’s syndrome due to metastatic
adrenal carcinoma has been reported to normalize her cortisol levels
under therapy with fluconazole (fig. 8), an antifungal azolederivative, at doses between 200 and 400 mg/day [194].

the beginning of ketoconazole action is slower than that of
 xxxd2633xxx . however, ketoconazole do not increase androgen concentration, being more acceptable in peripubertal children and
women, in particular in patients with severe hirsutism [170,172].
advantageous effects usually persist long term with ketoconazole
in monotherapy, although escape has been reported in patients with
cushing’s disease treated for long periods [171,179].

nh2

reduction in cortisol production may give rise to an increase in
acth secretion in patients with cushing’s disease but not in patients with ectopic acth secretion [184]. however, acth levels
do not appear to override steroidogenic blockade by the drug in
cushing’s syndrome. a reduction in plasma cholesterol levels has
also been reported in patients with cushing’s syndrome receiving
ketoconazole [169]. hypoadrenalism may occur with ketoconazole
therapy, hence some authors recommend routine corticosteroid
replacement therapy [192].

o

etomidate
pharmacological properties
etomidate (fig. 8), a hypnotic with no analgesic activity, is
used for induction of general anesthesia with minimal hemodynamic perturbation and little respiratory depression. etomidate is an
imidazole derivative that decreases cortisol and aldosterone levels
and their responses to acth [195]. it produces a concentrationdependent blockade of two mitochondrial cytochrome p450 dependent enzymes, cholesterol-side-chain cleavage enzyme, and
11-hydroxylase [195-199].
clinical applications
etomidate has been used for short-term control of hypercortisolemia in severely ill patients with cushing’s syndrome [200-202]
and ectopic acth syndrome [203,204]. it is a useful drug when a
rapid control of cortisol levels in patients with severe hypercortisolaemia and life-threatening complications is needed. a preparation
of  xxxd3034xxx  containing etomidate can be used safely for a
prolonged period to reduce hypercortisolemia in patients unable to
take oral medications [203]. nonhypnotic low dose infusion of 0.10.3 mg/kg/h has been used in patients with severe cushing’s syndrome. this drug may be an effective strategy for the control of
severe hypercortisolemia, especially in patients with resistance to
ketoconazole and  xxxd2633xxx  and life-threatening deterioration.
sedative effects and the need for intravenous administration limit
the usefulness of this compound [205].
 xxxg1601xxx -blocking agents
mifepristone
pharmacological properties
mifepristone (ru-486), 17-hydroxy-11-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-17-(1-propynyl)-estra-4,9-dien-3-one (fig. 9), is a synthetic steroid molecule with high affinity to the glucocorticoid and
 xxxg1737xxx , where it acts as a competitive antagonist
[206,207]. mifepristone seems to inhibit both the glucocorticoid
receptor activation and the gene transcription phenomenon. an
agonistic action on  xxxg1601xxx  has also been reported,
but it was inadequate to prevent adrenal insufficiency [208].
mifepristone has been used at doses ranging 5-25 mg/kg/day
[209-211]. the long half-life of the drug poses problems with titration of dose within a therapeutic range. addisonian crisis has been
reported in patients treated with this drug [209]. mifepristone
causes acth disinhibition and exacerbation of hypercortisolism
[211].
clinical applications
in patients with cushing’s syndrome, mifepristone therapy
improved clinical symptoms of hypercortisolism [209,212]. in
cushing's disease administration of mifepristone improves gluco-

corticoid-dependent biochemical parameters and induces a strong
and long lasting acth and cortisol rise [212], what is an inconvenience to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness. the lack of a biomarker
of  xxxg1601xxx  activity is another difficulty in monitoring therapy. in patients with cushing’ disease prolonged administration of mifepristone caused activation of the pituitary-adrenal
axis with a rise in urinary and plasma cortisol levels that would
overcome the peripheral effects of the drug [212]. long-term effectiveness and dramatic clinical improvement have been reported in a
patient with severe cushing’s disease treated with pituitary irradiation after unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery who received high
dose mifepristone for 18 months [211]. mifepristone has been recommended for rapid reversal of symptoms in patients with acute
and severe complications, such as hypercortisolemic psychosis
[210]. it has also been recommended in inoperable patients with
ectopic acth secretion or adrenal carcinoma who have failed to
respond to other treatments [207].
combined treatments
combined therapy has been used in some patients with the intention to reduce dose of each drug and diminish the incidence of
adverse effects. drugs tend to act synergistically and it is seldom
necessary to use maximum doses of drugs in combination. several
authors [119,124,125] have used combined therapy of  xxxd147xxx  plus metyarpone, thus producing an enzymatic blockade
of cortisol biosynthesis at different levels. normalization of plasma
or urinary cortisol was achieved in 67-100% of cases. replacement
glucocorticoid therapy is needed to avoid adrenal insufficiency.
hydrocortisone is the drug of choice, since  xxxd147xxx  accelerates dexamethasone metabolism.  xxxd147xxx  in combination with  xxxd2656xxx  has been used in a patient with ectopic
acth secretion [152].
combined treatment with 1.200 mg/day of sodium valproate
and 15 mg/day of bromocriptine, two modulators of acth release,
induced a complete remission in a patient with cushing’s disease
with failure to respond to each drug in monotherapy [61]. however
the association of  xxxd1785xxx  and bromocriptine did not result
in effective reduction of acth levels in patients with cushing’s
disease after bilateral adrenalectomy [24].
a patient with the ectopic acth syndrome due to a lung carcinoma was successfully managed with  xxxd2443xxx , a long-acting somatostatin analogue, 90 mg per month, together with the longacting dopamine agonist cabergoline, 7 mg per week [213]. in this
patients the presence of  xxxg2209xxx  and  xxxg656xxx  expression was demonstrated in a tumor sample.
association of valproate and  xxxd2633xxx  combines a centrally
acting drug with an inhibitor of cortisol biosynthesis. glaser et al.
[67] demonstrated the effectiveness of this combination in patients
with cushing’s disease. in 6 patients with cushing’s the addition of
sodium valproate to  xxxd2633xxx  produced a further reduction in
plasma and urinary cortisol [214].
effectiveness of combined therapy with ketoconazole and octreotide has also been reported in patients with acth-dependent

pharmacological therapy of cushing’s syndrome

cushing’s syndrome, even in patients with poor response to each
drug in monotherapy [215]. this regimen has allow a reduction in
ketoconazole dose without loss of therapeutic effectiveness, what is
of special significance in patients who develop hepatic intolerance
to ketoconazole. it has also been suggested that ketoconazole treatment would potentiate the inhibitory action of octreotide on acth
secretion [215].
indications for medical therapy in cushing’s
syndrome
definitive cure of cushing’s syndrome only can be attained by
surgery or radiotherapy. therefore these procedures are the treatments of choice in patients with acth-dependent or independent
hypercortisolism [1,129,169,216-218]. nevertheless, drug therapy
plays a main role in the management of patients with cushing’s
syndrome. medical therapy for definitive treatment of noncurable
cushing’s disease or for palliative treatment of malignancy-related
hypercortisolism has been estimated to be necessary in 33% of
patients with cushing’s syndrome [129]. however, temporary
pharmacological treatment may be necessary in almost all patients
at any time throughout the natural history of their disease.
indications of pharmacological therapy in these patients are
summarised in table 2. drug therapy allows attaining a normocortisolemic state, and the correction of metabolic abnormalities,
table 2.

ing’s syndrome of any etiology with the aim of avoiding the deleterious consequences of prolonged exposure to cortisol excess.
in patients in whom surgery has failed, medical therapy is often
essential to reduce the hypercortisolism and its consequences. it
should be atempted before bilateral adrenalectomy is considered. in
patients with acth-secreting pituitary adenomas treated by pituitary irradiation drug therapy is an effective way to control cortisol
hypersecretion while awaiting the long-term effect of radiotherapy.
in patients with an occult source of ectopic acth secretion medical therapy is notably useful while investigations for location of the
origin of acth production are performed. in cases of severe hypercortisolism with serious physical or psychological symptoms
rapid and effective reduction of cortisol levels are required. in the
occasional patients in whom an accurate diagnosis cannot be established with certainty medical therapy may also be indicated in order
to maintain normocortisolemia.
advantages of medical therapy in these circumstances include
correction of hyperglycaemia and hypokaliemia, improvement in
myopathic symptoms, neuropsychiatric derangements and capilar
fragility [129]. adrenal insufficiency is a danger inherent to all
forms of medical therapy of cushing’s syndrome. cortisol secretion
must be monitored in all patients under hypocortisolemic drug therapy. cortisol production rate by isotopic dilution [220] is the most
accurate method to measure endogenous cortisol secretion, however
it is unfeasible in the clinical setting in most centres. a cortisol
profile with repeated samples throughout the day can detect transient hypoadrenalism [221]. it is a useful procedure, but not without
practical difficulty. urinary free cortisol levels is the simplest way
to estimate the effectiveness of therapy.
therapeutic strategies
cushing’s disease
pituitary adenomectomy by transsphenoidal approach is the
treatment of choice in most patients with cushing’s disease [1,222224]. remission of hypercortisolism after operation is achieved in
70-80% of patients, depending on the tumour volume and surgical
experience. relapse of the disease may occur in 5-20% of these
patients. therefore, when hypercortisolism persists or relapses after
initial surgery, radiation therapy [1,126,225,226] o a second surgical operation [227] is indicated. while awaiting for the effect of
radiotherapy pharmacological treatment must be employed (fig.
10).

fig. (10). simplified algorithm for the treatment of acth-dependent cushing’s syndrome.

476

mini-reviews in medicinal chemistry, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

there is no drug with ability to attain a sustained and effective
blockade of acth secretion or effects in these patients. long-tem
studies have shown no favourable results with centrally acting
drugs. inhibitors of cortisol production are, therefore, to be used in
these patients (table 3). the choice of drug varies according to the
opinion or experience of the authors. some recommend  xxxd2656xxx 
[137,138,151], while others prefer ketoconazole [169,172,195,225],
 xxxd2633xxx  [118,120,122] or combination of these compounds
[119,124].

in patients with cushing’s disease who are not cured by
transsphenoidal surgery or pituitary irradiation surgical bilateral
adrenalectomy or medical adrenalectomy with  xxxd2656xxx  is indicated
for final definitive cure. those who do not have a complete response with  xxxd2656xxx  or who cannot be treated by adrenalectomy
can be given adrenal enzyme inhibitors to ameliorate hypercortisolism.
ectopic acth secretion
removal of the ectopic source of acth is the optimal management in patients with ectopic acth syndrome [228]. medical
interventions have been employed in attempts to control the hypercortisolsim associated with inoperable ectopic acth production or
after unsuccessful surgery. 111in-pentetreotide scintigraphy is usefull to identify patients with neuroendocrine tumors that exhibit
somatostatin receptors. in these cases a trial with somatostatin analogues is warranted. intraoperative 111in-pentetreotide scintigraphy
with a hand-held gamma detector probe has recently been proposed
to increase the intraoperative detection rate of small tumors and
their metastases [229].
ketoconazole [169,171,178-180,184,185,188-192],  xxxd2656xxx 
[152],  xxxd2633xxx  [118,123-125,152,230] and  xxxd147xxx 
[125] in monotherapy or in combination [124,125] are the most
useful drugs in these patients. the use of  xxxd2656xxx  is limited by its
slow onset of action. plasma acth levels usually do not rise in
response to decreasing cortisol concentrations, alghouth significant
elevations have been reported [125]. replacement therapy with
glucocorticoids should be added in case of drug induced hypoadrenalism. combination therapy with ketoconazole and octreotide is promising. its usefulness has been demonstrated even in
patients with poor response to each drug taken singularly [215]. in
patients uncontrollable with medical therapy surgical adrenalectomy is indicated.
nelson’s syndrome
pituitary irradiation is the best procedure to prevent the development of nelson’s syndrome in patients undergoing either medical
or surgical adrenalectomy. protection is not complete, since some
adrenalectomized patients develop nelson’s syndrome despite prior
irradiation [231,232]. all adrenalectomized patients should be followed indefinitely with periodic measurement of plasma acth and

díez and iglesias

imaging of the pituitary gland. when a patient with nelson’s syndrome develops a large tumor, it is often locally invasive and difficult to manage. pituitary surgery, either by the transsphenoidal or
cranial approach, is the treatment of choice. large tumors have the
propensity to recur [226]. radiotherapy should be employed postoperatively in all patients with residual tumor [233]. proton beam
radiation seems to be more successful than conventional radiation.
to avoid damage to the optic pathways stereotactic gamma knife
[234] or linear accelerator photon knife radiosurgery [235] have
been advised, but there are few reported results.
until now there is no effective drug therapy for nelson’s syndrome (fig. 10).  xxxd1785xxx  was effective in few cases [22].
sodium valproate therapy did not show effectiveness in the longterm [236,237]. acute administration of bromocriptine lowered
plasma acth concentrations acutely in patients with nelson’s
syndrome [238]. in some cases, long-term octreotide treatment has
been reported to be effective with normalization of acth levels
and no tumor extension [74]. interestingly, ketoconazole decreased
acth secretion in vitro in pituitary adenoma cells from patients
with nelson’s syndrome [239].
acth-independent cushing’s syndrome
adrenal adenoma is treated by surgery, usually unilateral
adrenalectomy, with an excellent outcome. surgery is also the first
line treatment for adrenal cortical carcinoma, although it rarely is
curative since many patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis. high doses of  xxxd2656xxx  are the drug of choice in metastatic or
persistent disease after surgery [135,140,240,241]. this therapy is
palliative in some cases, but it can avoid recurrences in patients
who lack detectable disease after surgery [242]. in patients with
intolerance to  xxxd2656xxx , ketoconazole,  xxxd2633xxx  or  xxxd147xxx  can be used (fig. 11). in patients with functional metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma who have failed to respond to adrenal blocking agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy a trial with octreotide may be justified [106].
most cases of macro- or micronodular adrenal hyperplasia are
treated by bilateral adrenalectomy [243-245]. steroidogenesis inhibitors may be used if needed to control hypercortisolism. the
demostration that the presence and activation of adrenal aberrant
receptors may be responsible for chronic hypercortisolism has been
provided in some cases in which remission of the disease was observed under specific receptor blockade (fig. 11) [246,247].
cushing’s syndrome in pregnancy
untreated cushing’s syndrome during pregnancy is associated
with significant maternal and fetal morbidity. adrenal tumor is the
main cause of cushing’s syndrome during pregnancy [248-250].
surgical adrenalectomy has been successfully used in pregnant
women with cushing’s syndrome [248]. this procedure may reduce
the incidence of fetal death, neonatal and maternal complications
[251]. pituitary surgery is also recommended in women with cushing’s disease [252].
medical therapy is indicated late in the third trimester and pending definitive therapy [249].  xxxd147xxx  [253] and  xxxd2633xxx  [254] have been used. both drugs cross the placental barrier and may inhibit cortisol biosynthesis in the fetus; furthermore,
fetal virilization precludes the use of  xxxd147xxx  [253].
 xxxd2633xxx  seems to be the drug of choice in cases of nonsurgical
treatment during pregnancy. it is well tolerated and is not known to
be teratogenic [254,255], but its efficacy is unclear [248,256] and it

ported [258]. corticosteroid replacement in infants has not been
necessary in the reported cases.
ketoconazole has been used in few cases without adverse effects [259]. however, this drug is teratogenic in the rat and should
not be used in pregnancy.  xxxd2656xxx  should not be given to pregnant
women because it crosses the placenta and is teratogenic [260].
 xxxd2656xxx  is also contraindicated in women desiring fertility within
2-5 years since its effects may persist after discontinuation due to
gradual release form adipose tissue [260].
