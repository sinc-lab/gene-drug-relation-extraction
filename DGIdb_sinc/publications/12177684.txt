abstract
flibanserin has preferential affinity for serotonin 5-ht1a, dopamine d4, and serotonin
5-ht2a receptors. in vitro and in microiontophoresis, flibanserin behaves as a 5-ht1a
agonist, a very weak partial agonist on dopamine d4 receptors, and a 5-ht2a antagonist.
in vivo flibanserin binds equally to 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors. however, under higher
levels of brain 5-ht (i.e., under stress), flibanserin may occupy 5-ht2a receptors in
higher proportion than 5-ht1a receptors. the effects of flibanserin on adenylyl cyclase
are different from those of buspirone and 8-oh-dpat, two other purported  xxxg1108xxx  agonists. flibanserin reduces neuronal firing rate in cells of the dorsal raphe, hippocampus, and cortex with the ca1 region being the most sensitive in the brain.
flibanserin-induced reduction in firing rate in the cortex seems to be mediated through
stimulation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors, whereas the reduction of the number of
active cells seems to be mediated through  xxxg658xxx  stimulation. flibanserin
quickly desensitizes somatic 5-ht autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe and enhances tonic
activation of postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in the ca3 region. flibanserin preferentially
reduces synthesis and extracellular levels of 5-ht in the cortex, where it enhances
extracellular levels of ne and da. flibanserin displays antidepressant-like activity in
most animal models sensitive to antidepressants. such activity, however, seems qualitatively different from that exerted by other antidepressants. flibanserin seems to act via
direct or indirect stimulation of 5-ht1a, da, and opioid receptors in those animal models.
flibanserin does not display consistent effects in animal models of anxiety and seems to
exert potential antipsychotic effects. flibanserin may induce some sedation but does not
induce observable toxic effects at pharmacologically relevant doses.

binding studies
flibanserin shows the highest affinity for cloned human serotonin 5-ht1a receptors
compared with cloned human d4 (isoforms 4.2, 4.4, and 4.7) and 5-ht2a receptors
(table 1). this rank of affinity values is still maintained when the affinity for 5-ht1a and
5-ht2a receptors was evaluated in brain tissue. however, flibanserin displays higher affinity for 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors in cloned cells than in cerebral tissue (the affinity
for d4 receptors was not tested in tissues).
flibanserin also shows some affinity for human d2l and d3 receptors and rat nealpha1 and 5-ht7 receptors (12). flibanserin has different affinity for rat (> 10,000 nm)
and human (305–785 nm) d2 receptors (12). the affinity for all other receptors, including
the 5-ht transporter (12), varies from low to very low (table 1).
flibanserin does not inhibit monoamine oxidase activity (borsini et al., 1998).

receptor activity
the activity of flibanserin on 5-ht1a receptors was assessed by using biochemical

microiontophoretic application) indices. activity at dopamine d4 receptors was investigated using various biochemical parameters (adenylyl cyclase, microphysiometry, and
gtp-shift).
activity on 5-ht2a receptors was assessed biochemically by determining the phosphatidylinositol turnover.

activity at 5-ht1a receptors
flibanserin behaves as a 5-ht1a agonist in cloned cells and the cortex and hippocampus of human and rat brain (table 2). in the dorsal raphe, flibanserin behaves as an agonist when firing rate was taken as an index of activity in rats (58) but was devoid of agonist activity when  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp was measured in human tissue (44).
in contrast to the dorsal raphe nucleus of rats (24), 5-ht1a receptors in the dorsal raphe
nucleus of humans appears to be linked with adenylyl cyclase (44). in human tissues, the
ec50 of flibanserin in reducing  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp formation is similar to the affinity values for 5-ht1a receptors (table 1 and 2). in contrast, the ec50 of flibanserin in
reducing  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp formation in cells or rat tissues is different from the
affinity values for 5-ht1a receptors. the coupling system between the receptor and the
g-proteins is important to demonstrate activity for agonists (55). thus, it may be that the
relative amount of various g-proteins present in human tissue is different from that
present in cho cells or rat tissue. flibanserin binds to only one site in human 5-ht1a receptors (44), whereas it binds to high- and low-affinity sites in rodent 5-ht1a receptors
(12). thus, a different proportion of high-/low-affinity sites might explain the different
values between 5-ht1a affinity and ec50 on camp. nevertheless, flibanserin is more
potent in reducing camp in the hippocampus than in the cortex, both in rats and humans.
in contrast, when electrophysiology is considered, flibanserin is more potent in the cortex
than the hippocampus (table 2).

borsini et al.

the effect of flibanserin in 5-ht1a cloned cells, in human and rat cortex seems to be
mediated by stimulating 5-ht1a receptors (table 3), as shown by the ability of all the
5-ht1a antagonists we used to reduce the effect of flibanserin. however, it is less clear
whether 5-ht1a receptors mediate the effects of flibanserin in the hippocampus (table 3),
as suggested by the observation that two out of five 5-ht1a antagonists failed to antagonize flibanserin (17,44,58). other purported 5-ht1a agonists, such as 8-oh-dpat and
buspirone, failed to inhibit camp in the rat cortex (12) or human hippocampus (44), respectively, so 8-oh-dpat and buspirone were used as antagonists in these two regions in
our studies.

activity on d4 receptors
as far as the effects of flibanserin on dopamine d4 receptors are concerned, these were
only tested in cloned cells (table 4). flibanserin behaved as an antagonist of forskolinstimulated camp when  xxxg658xxx  density was < 450 fmol/mg protein or as a
full agonist when flibanserin concentrations were very high (> 30 ìm). flibanserin behaved as a partial agonist (microphysiometry and gtp shift) when  xxxg658xxx 
density was > 750 fmol/mg protein, which is much higher than that has been reported in
the human brain (0.2–50 fmol/protein; 49,63). in an attempt to evaluate the affinity/activity of flibanserin for dopamine d4 receptors directly in human brain, the binding of the
suggested dopamine d4 ligand nemonapride was investigated in human postmortem
cortex and striatum. however, no dopamine d4 receptors were detected in the cortex and
caudatum of nonpsychiatric subjects (d. marazziti, university of pisa, italy, personal
communication, january 2001).

activity at 5-ht2a receptors
flibanserin behaves as a 5-ht2a-receptor antagonist. in fact, it does not enhance pi
turnover per se and antagonized 5-ht-stimulated turnover in mouse cortex (12). the affinity values for tissue 5-ht2a receptors (115–133 nm) and the ki in reducing 5-htstimulated turnover (113 nm) are in good agreement.

activity at 5-ht7 receptors
flibanserin (up to 1 ìm) did not modify relaxation induced by the 5-ht7 agonist
5-carboxamidotryptamine in ileum that was contracted by administration of  xxxg2240xxx 
(41). at higher concentrations, flibanserin reduced  xxxg2240xxx  contractions (41).

in vivo binding to 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors
information from in vitro binding studies is limited by the fact that the endogenous
neurotransmitter is not present. the presence in vivo of 5-ht, which has higher affinity for
5-ht1a than 5-ht2a receptors (27), may differently influence the binding of flibanserin to
these receptors. thus, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the in vivo binding of
flibanserin (table 5). flibanserin, in spite of different in vitro affinity values, occupies

5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors in vivo in similar percentages (60). in addition, flibanserin
preferentially occupies 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors in the cortex at doses as low as
1 mg/kg. it has been reported that a full agonist needs to occupy about 20% of receptors to
induce an effect (47,66). in contrast, antagonism is evident with at least 70% of receptor
occupancy (28,38). thus, flibanserin should be capable of triggering 5-ht1a-mediated

mechanisms only in the cortex at a dose of 1 mg/kg, while flibanserin doses as high as
30 mg/kg should be necessary to exert antagonist properties on 5-ht2a receptors.
table 5 refers to an experiment performed in normal rats. in case of stress, 5-ht levels
may increase several fold (39,64), and thus 5-ht may differently compete with flibanserin
for binding to 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors. in order to understand this, a computer simulation was performed in conditions where the concentration of 5-ht varied from 0 to
1 ìm (table 6). when 5-ht is present in concentrations between 1 and 10 nm, flibanserin
has higher affinity for 5-ht1a than for 5-ht2a receptors. however, when 5-ht concentrations are between 100 and 1,000 nm, flibanserin should significantly occupy 5-ht2a retable 6. computer simulations describing the expected behavior of flibanserin in vivo

and 100 nm for 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors, respectively. the apparent ki values of the drug for the
receptors was calculated by simulating the presence of different 5-ht concentrations (1–1,000 nm),
according to the following equation (valid for a competitive interaction for the same binding site):
ki(app) = ki(1+ [5-ht]/kd ). this simulation was performed by t. mennini and m. gobbi, mario

ceptors at lower concentrations than those that are necessary to occupy 5-ht1a receptors.
according to the hypothesis that 5-ht2a antagonism should be present to favor 5-ht1a
agonism in the cortex (8), such a condition should occur for flibanserin when brain 5-ht
levels exceed 100 nm and if flibanserin concentration is between 104 and 343 nm. as
shown in table 7, flibanserin can reach sufficient concentrations at doses from 16 mg/kg.

electrophysiological effects
after systemic administration
electrophysiological data on firing rate were obtained by giving flibanserin intravenously (table 8). the most striking activity of flibanserin was on firing rate of ca1 hippocampal neurons, where it reduced firing rate by 50% at a dose as low as 3 ìg/kg (a. ceci,
boehringer ingelheim, data on file). to date, the effects of 5-ht1a antagonists on flibanserin action on ca1 neurons have not been evaluated. flibanserin reduced firing rate by
50% in the dorsal raphe at 200 ìg/kg, in ca3 hippocampal neurons at 1.4 mg/kg, and in
cortical neurons at 3 mg/kg (58). the potency difference of flibanserin in reducing the
firing rate of neurons in the ca1 and ca3 regions may not be surprising. in fact, it has
been suggested that the  xxxg1108xxx  recognition site may be different in the ca3 and
ca1 areas (3,5). it is interesting to compare these values with those necessary for 50%
 xxxg1108xxx  occupancy after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (table 5). for this
comparison, one must consider that the bioavailability of flibanserin in rats is 35%. thus,
the ed50 values (1.4 to 3 mg/kg, i.v.) of flibanserin in reducing the firing rate of neurons
in the ca3 region and cortex may be in line with ed50 values for receptor occupancy
(about 10 mg/kg, i.p., with higher occupancy in hippocampus). in contrast, flibanserin reduced the firing rate of the dorsal raphe neurons by 50% at 0.2 mg/kg, i.v., whereas it occupied 50% of 5-ht1a receptors in the midbrain only at a dose as high as 30 mg/kg, i.p.
however, receptor occupancy in the midbrain may not reflect receptor occupancy in the
dorsal raphe. nevertheless, flibanserin behaved as a full agonist in the dorsal raphe nucleus and its effect was blocked by 5-ht1a antagonists (table 9) (58; e. esposito, “mario
negri sud,” italy, personal communication, 1992). the effect of flibanserin in ca3 was

also found to be antagonized by 5-ht1a antagonists (58). however, the effect of flibanserin on dorsal raphe and hippocampus is different. the effect on the firing rate of the
dorsal raphe is short lasting. in fact, flibanserin 5 mg/kg, s.c., reduced dorsal firing rate by
only 25% after 2 days and did not reduce it after 7 days, a consequence of receptor desensitization (57). in contrast, the same dose of flibanserin enhanced tonic activation of
postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in the ca3 region after 2 days administration as much as
after 7 days (57).
as far as the firing rate of cortical neurons is concerned, flibanserin-induced inhibition
seems to be mediated by 5-ht1a receptors, even if one out of three 5-ht1a antagonists
used in the cortex did not antagonize flibanserin (table 9). the effect of flibanserin in the
cortex was not blocked by the chemical destruction of 5-ht-containing neurons by
5,7-dht (15), which significantly depleted brain 5-ht by 80% (ne was reduced by 27%
[not significant]). thus, it appears that flibanserin does not require 5-ht neurons to exert
its inhibitory effects on the cortex. once more, the other 5-ht1a agonists 8-oh-dpat and
buspirone, which were used as comparators, behaved differently from flibanserin. in fact,
in contrast with flibanserin, buspirone excited cortical neurons, and 8-oh-dpat excited
them at low doses and inhibited them at high doses (15). additionally, the inhibitory effects of 8-oh-dpat were completely blocked by 5,7-dht (15).
in addition to reducing firing rate, flibanserin also decreased the number of spontaneously active cells in the cortex (12). flibanserin exerted a significant effect already at
2 mg/kg, i.p., and induced the maximal inhibition (about 80%) at 8 mg/kg (fig. 1). the
maximum effect was at 6 h and a significant reduction was still observed after 24 h
(fig. 2). when a 5-ht1a antagonist was used to evaluate whether this effect of flibanserin
was mediated by 5-ht1a receptors, the results were unclear. in fact, the 5-ht1a antagonist
n-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-alpha-phenyl-[(±)way100135] (30 mg/kg,
s.c.) antagonized flibanserin only in one of the two experiments performed. the effect of
flibanserin was also antagonized by the d4 antagonist 1h-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine,3-[[4(4-chlorophenyl) xxxd2960xxx -1-yl]methyl] (l-745, 870) (at 30 mg/kg, i.p., but not  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg).
thus, the effect of firing rate appears to be mediated by 5-ht1a receptors, whereas the
effect on reduction of spontaneously active cells appear to be mediated by dopamine d4
receptors and probably 5-ht1a receptors (fig. 3).
flibanserin, 5 mg/kg, administered s.c. for 2 days, reduced the electrophysiological effects of the 5-ht2 agonist (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine [doi] by 33% when applied microiontophoretically into the cortex (57). this antagonism towards doi disappeared
after 7 days. however, it is questionable whether the antagonistic activity of flibanserin

effects on turnover
and extracellular levels of 5-ht
flibanserin exerts a preferential action in the cortex (table 10). in fact, flibanserin,
2 mg/kg, reduces 5-ht turnover in the cortex without altering it in hippocampus and
brainstem (18). this preferential activity on the cortex distinguishes flibanserin from the
other  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, buspirone and 8-oh-dpat, which reduce 5-ht turnover
to a similar extent in the cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem (18). the effect of 8-oh-dpat
and buspirone was interpreted to result from somatic presynaptic  xxxg1108xxx  activation, which inhibits 5-ht turnover in all the 5-ht-containing axons departing from the
raphe nuclei. flibanserin begins to inhibit 5-ht turnover in the hippocampus at 16 mg/kg,
this dose is 8 times higher than the dose necessary to begin to reduce 5-ht turnover in the
cortex. in contrast, flibanserin did not consistently affect 5-ht turnover in the brainstem,
where raphe nuclei are located. thus, it is not clear why flibanserin reduces 5-ht turnover
in the cortex at doses lower than those required to induce the same effect in the hippocampus. flibanserin reduced 5-ht turnover in the cortex by 50% at 8 mg/kg i.p., which
fits well with its occupancy of cortical 5-ht1a receptors. 5-ht1a receptors are not located
on cortical or hippocampal nerve endings (35). thus, it may be that flibanserin stimulates
5-ht1a receptors in the cortex, which in turn trigger a negative feedback on 5-ht release.
such negative feedback has been shown to occur in the cortex (20,21,34). this may explain the preferential effect of flibanserin only on those neurons that project to the cortex.
such feedback mechanisms seem to work less efficiently in the hippocampus.
a preferential effect of flibanserin on the cortex was observed also in microdialysis experiments. a reduction in cortical extracellular 5-ht levels was observed already with flibanserin, 3 mg/kg, i.p. (table 10). cortical extracellular 5-ht levels were reduced by

cns drug reviews, vol. 8, no. 2, 2002

borsini et al.

about 50% at a dose of 10 mg/kg, i.p., which fits well with the occupancy of cortical
5-ht1a receptors by flibanserin. extracellular levels of 5-ht were not changed in the hippocampus by flibanserin at doses that reduced extracellular 5-ht levels in the cortex.
presynaptic 5-ht1b/d receptors have been reported to inhibit 5-ht release (40). however,
flibanserin has low affinity for these receptors. thus, the microdialysis experiments also
support the hypothesis that flibanserin may trigger a feedback mechanism on 5-ht cortical neurons through stimulation of cortical postsynaptic 5-ht1a receptors. electrophysiological experiments showed that very close systemic doses of flibanserin stimulate
5-ht1a receptors in the cortex and the ca3 to a similar extent. thus, experiments with
microdialysis also support the notion that the negative feedback does not work well in hippocampus. however, another possible hypothesis might be that flibanserin mainly acts on
those 5-ht1a somatic autoreceptors located on dorsal raphe neurons that specifically
project to the cortex. in this case, the occupancy of 5-ht1a receptors in the midbrain (44%
 xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg, i.p.) might not reflect the real receptor occupancy in the dorsal raphe. the
same holds for the data on 5-ht synthesis that were obtained from all the brainstem.
when the microdialytic probe was inserted into the dorsal raphe, however, a reduction of
5-ht extracellular concentration was not observed at the dose of 3 mg/kg, which induced
5-ht extracellular reduction in the cortex. flibanserin significantly reduced 5-ht
extracellular levels in the dorsal raphe only  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg, i.p. buspirone and 8-oh-dpat,
which have been reported to be active on somatic 5-ht1a autoreceptors, behave differently from flibanserin. in fact, both buspirone and 8-oh-dpat reduce 5-ht synthesis and

extracellular levels in the terminal regions and dorsal raphe at the same doses (18,37).
thus, the hypothesis that flibanserin may primarily interact with dorsal raphe neurons to
exert its neurochemical effects is not so clearly supported by experimental findings.
flibanserin, at 3 mg/kg, increased the extracellular concentration of norepinephrine
(ne). since a direct action of flibanserin on noradrenergic receptors may be excluded
(table 1), it may be that this elevation of ne (and da, see below) levels is secondary to
the reduced release of 5-ht. in fact, it has been reported that 5-ht may inhibit the release
of ne and da in the cortex (53,59,61).
the effects of flibanserin  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg in increasing cortical ne and da are very clear,
as this increase reaches about 100%. however, the increase in da lasts for a shorter time
than that of ne (table 11). this increase in da might explain the dopamine d4-mediated
effects of flibanserin in reducing the number of spontaneously active cells. in fact, these
effects were also exerted to the same extent by the full dopamine d4 agonist pramipexole
(a. ceci, boehringer ingelheim, personal communication, 1998), but the biochemical data
indicated that flibanserin is a partial agonist on dopamine d4 receptors. thus, it seems
conceivable that flibanserin reduces the number of spontaneously active cells via increased release of da, which in turn activates dopamine d4 receptors.

summary of functional aspects
the first interaction of flibanserin with brain structures occurs in the hippocampus and
dorsal raphe, as revealed by electrophysiological experiments. the mechanism of this interaction in ca1 has not been explored. in the ca3 and dorsal raphe, flibanserin inhibits
firing rate through stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors. all these events happened at doses
below and around 1 mg/kg. from 1 up to 10 mg/kg, flibanserin interacts with the cortex.
this cortical interaction is evident electrophysiologically and biochemically, and it seems
to be mediated by 5-ht1a receptors, even if dopaminergic d4-mediated effects were also
observed. the interaction with  xxxg1113xxx  is not very clear. above 10 mg/kg, there
is also a biochemical interaction of flibanserin with the hippocampus and dorsal raphe.

thus, flibanserin exerts two different levels of effects in hippocampus and dorsal
raphe. the interaction of flibanserin with these two brain structures is observed electrophysiologically at low doses and biochemically at higher doses (table 12). in contrast,
flibanserin exerts a consistent activity profile in the cortex, since both electrophysiological
and biochemical techniques reveal effects at similar doses (table 12). this heterogeneous
picture may reflect the well-known heterogeneous pharmacology of 5-ht1a receptors
(6,7,9,56). in fact, in the dorsal raphe, flibanserin behaves as a full agonist when firing rate
is considered as an index of activity, but it is devoid of stimulant properties when adenylyl
cyclase is taken as a measure of activity. likewise, in hippocampus, flibanserin behaves as
partial agonist when firing rate is considered, but as a full agonist when adenylyl cyclase
is measured.
nevertheless, flibanserin seems to exert unique pharmacological properties. in fact, its
effects are different from those of two purported 5-ht1a agonists, buspirone and 8-oh-dpat
(table 13). however, it is difficult to understand whether this difference solely depends on
the different drug effects at 5-ht1a receptors or on other factors. in fact, buspirone and
8-oh-dpat can bind also to dopamine d2 and 5-ht7 receptors, respectively, and flibanserin to dopamine d4 and 5-ht2a receptors.
finally, the terminal half-life values of flibanserin in plasma were 0.9 h (i.v.) and 1.9 h
(p.o.) in rats. the half-life values are in agreement with the duration of some effects induced by flibanserin, but not with others (table 11), such as 5-ht turnover in the cortex or
the number of active cells in the cortex. so far, it is unknown whether the metabolites of
flibanserin play a pharmacological role.

behavioral effects
rats seems more susceptible than mice to the inhibitory effects of flibanserin on motor
activity (14). in fact, reduced motor activity was observed at doses of 8 to 16 mg/kg, i.p.,
in rats, and no reduction of motor activity was seen with doses up to 32 mg/kg, i.p., in mice.
flibanserin induced failure to grasp the wire in the traction test (r. cesana, boehringer
ingelheim, data on file) in 50% of mice at a dose of about 45 mg/kg, i.p., or 95 mg/kg,

cns drug reviews, vol. 8, no. 2, 2002

borsini et al.

p.o. at 64 mg/kg, p.o., mice also displayed hypomotility and hypothermia. these effects
were more pronounced at 128 mg/kg. at this high dose, the following additional alterations were also observed: reduced grip strength, ptosis and head weaving, and occasional
catalepsy. some signs of a weak serotonergic syndrome were observed at 64 mg/kg, i.p.,
in rats (13).

animal models sensitive to antidepressants
flibanserin was tested in 13 animal models sensitive to antidepressants. it was active in
the following 10 models (table 14): learned helplessness in rats (16), bulbectomized rats
(16), chronic mild stress in rats and mice (25), muricidal rats (10), amphetamine withdrawal in rats (31), rem sleep latency reduction (w. gaida, boehringer ingelheim, data
on file), forced swimming test in mice (23), distress calls in chicks (10), and fixed ratio
(fi) schedule in mice (10). in contrast, flibanserin did not show antidepressant-like behavior in the forced swimming test (10) and differential-reinforcement-of-low rate 72 sec
[drl-72] (16) in rats and tail suspension in mice (10). active doses ranged between 10
and 32 mg/kg, i.p., except in the chronic mild stress model in mice where activity was
seen after 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p., and in rem sleep latency in rats, where an effect was observed after 1 mg/kg, p.o. in rats, the antidepressant-like effects of flibanserin occur at the
same doses that induce sedation. thus, sedation may be a possible explanation for the
antimuricidal activity of flibanserin or the effect of flibanserin in bulbectomized rats.
however, there are some tests where flibanserin did not alter rat motor behavior, e.g.,
swimming in the morris maze (14) or escape behavior in the learned helplessness test
(16). flibanserin can even increase rat motor activity in amphetamine withdrawal (31).
thus, it is difficult to ascertain to what extent sedation may be responsible for the effect of
flibanserin in muricidal or bulbectomized rats. however, flibanserin seems to induce se-

dation in resting animals or in animals whose motivation to explore is not high (as in the
actimeter); at the same time, it increases the drive of animals toward goal-oriented behavior, such as in the learned helplessness test (16) or the fixed ratio operant behavior
(10). thus, one may understand why there is no motor reduction in swimming to search
for the hidden platform in the morris maze, or why there is a higher escaping activity in
the learned helplessness test. this might also explain the contrasting finding of “depressive-like” effects in the forced swimming test in rats and antidepressant-like effects in
mice. rats have lower motivation to explore the environment, since they are pretested
24 h earlier. mice, however, are tested in the forced swimming test without pretest and
have, therefore, no familiarity with the environment. likewise, flibanserin reduced calls in
rat pups that were pretested (54) but increased calls in chicks that were not pretested (10).
the reduction of movement power induced by flibanserin in the tail suspension test may
reflect some effects of flibanserin on spinal 5-ht1a receptors (46), since mice are suspended with the head down in the tail suspension test. however, all these thoughts are
highly speculative, and the failure of flibanserin in the forced swimming test and drl-72
in rats, as well as in tail suspension in mice, remains difficult to explain. in fact, flibanserin is a 5-ht1a agonist and a 5-ht2 antagonist and one or both these two mechanisms
have been reported to play a role in those tests (see 10,16). this points out, once more, the
difference between flibanserin and the other 5-ht1a agonists.
in summary, flibanserin did not show antidepressant-like activity in all of the tests, and
induced different behavioral changes than those observed with imipramine (table 15).
only clinical trials will tell whether flibanserin will be an antidepressant. however, if
flibanserin is an antidepressant, it may be different from the classical antidepressants.
flibanserin’s mechanism of action in animal models of depression was investigated
in the forced swimming test in mice (23) and learned helplessness in rats (11). in both
models, the effects of flibanserin were not reduced by brain 5-ht depletion, suggesting
that the effect of flibanserin does not require the integrity of 5-ht containing neurons.
however, whereas the effect of flibanserin seems to be mediated by  xxxg1108xxx  stimulation in mice, this does not seem to occur in rats. in both models, dopamine d1 or d2 antagonists reduced the effects of flibanserin. active doses of flibanserin in these models
ranged from 16 to 32 mg/kg. at this dose range, 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors should be
occupied by approximately 50 to 70% (table 5). since flibanserin has lower affinity for
both, rat d1 and d2 receptors (table 1), it is possible that flibanserin activates dopamine
receptors indirectly, through release of da.  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg flibanserin has been shown to
increase dopamine release (table 10). the effect of flibanserin in the learned helplessness

test was also blocked by naloxone (11). interestingly, like many other antidepressants,
flibanserin activates ì-opioid receptors without inducing rewarding properties (11).
by repeated daily administration flibanserin did not produce tolerance to its antidepressant-like effects in the chronic mild stress procedure in mice (25), in bulbectomized
rats (16), and in the forced swimming test in mice (fig. 4). in contrast to imipramine, a
subeffective dose of flibanserin remains inactive even after repeated administrations
(fig. 5). thus, it seems that, in contrast to imipramine or fluoxetine, flibanserin has antidepressant-like effects after a single administration and that these effects are maintained
over time. with repeated administration of flibanserin to animals, the effect of the 5-ht1a
agonist 8-oh-dpat on body temperature is attenuated, whereas the effect on forced
swimming test is still present (fig. 6). it has been suggested that 8-oh-dpat induces its
effects in the forced swimming test and on body temperature by acting on 5-ht1a postand presynaptic receptors, respectively (42). thus, it appears that flibanserin exert its antidepressant-like effect independently from involvement at 5-ht1a presynaptic receptors.
this contrasts with classical antidepressants, the 5-ht postsynaptic activity of which appears to be secondary to the downregulation of 5-ht1a presynaptic receptors (1,4).

animal models sensitive to anxiolytics
flibanserin, at 2 to 50 mg/kg, was tested in the elevated plus maze (16), conflict test
(table 16), and ultrasonic model (54) in rats and in the dark/light exploratory test (16) and

flibanserin reduced ultrasonic vocalization in rat pups, without altering body temperature
or motor activity. at 8 to 16 mg/kg i.p., flibanserin exerted anxiolytic-like effects in the
two tests in mice. it is worth noting that flibanserin induced strong sedative effects at
16 mg/kg in mice in the dark/light test, which was carried out during the dark phase of
the light/dark cycle. this contrasts with the absence of sedative effects on motor activity
in the actimer when registered during the light phase of the light/dark period. in rats,
flibanserin was devoid of any effect in the elevated plus maze, and exerted anxiogenic-like
effects in the conflict test (table 16). the possibility that flibanserin can increase pain sensitivity (as the conflict test is based on a weak electrical shock) was evaluated in mice.

flibanserin exerted no algesic effects. the conflict procedure was based on food pellet delivery, thus a possible effect of flibanserin on food intake cannot be ruled out since it reduces food intake in rats at doses as low as 5 mg/kg (32). the mechanism of action of
flibanserin in animal models of anxiety has not yet been investigated.

animal models sensitive to antipsychotics
flibanserin was studied in tests of psychostimulant-induced hypermotility (14). it reduced hypermotility induced by the s agonist (+)skf-100147 or by d-amphetamine at doses
of 4 and 8 mg/kg, i.p. in mice and at a dose of 8 mg/kg, i.p., in rats. in these experiments,
where the animals were habituated to the actimer, flibanserin did not significantly change
motor activity per se. flibanserin also reduced d-amphetamine-induced stereotypy at doses
of 8 and 16 mg/kg in rats and apomorphine-induced stereotypy at 16 mg/kg, i.p. (14).

other behavioral effects
5-ht2a antagonism. flibanserin, 4.1 mg/kg, antagonized head twitches induced by the
5-ht2 agonist doi in mice (12). however, it is questionable whether this effect depends
on 5-ht2a antagonism or rather on  xxxg1108xxx  activation (60).
analgesic affect. flibanserin antagonized 50% of phenylquinone-induced writhings in
mice at an oral dose of 10.4 (confidence limit = 2.5–42.9), indicating that it has a weak analgesic activity (36). flibanserin displayed antinociceptive effects in the hot plate in mice
only at a dose as high as 128 mg/kg, p.o. at this dose, a clear reduction of motor activity
was observed, which could have affected the motor response of animals in the hot plate
test. nevertheless, this activity was reduced by naloxone and potentiated by morphine.
interaction with sedative compounds. at 8 mg/kg i.p., flibanserin potentiated pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex in mice (mean duration of the loss of righting reflex
after 40 mg/kg, i.p., pentobarbital: vehicle = 41.3 ± 5 min; flibanserin 8 mg/kg = 69.4 ± 6.4 min,
p < 0.05; flibanserin 32 mg/kg = 119.6 ± 6.9 min, p < 0.01). at 16 mg/kg i.p., but not at
lower doses, flibanserin also potentiated  xxxd285xxx -induced loss of righting reflex in mice
(mean duration of the loss of righting reflex after 180 mg/kg, i.p.,  xxxd285xxx : vehicle = 85.1 ± 21.5 min; flibanserin 16 mg/kg = 202.3 ± 28.4 min; p < 0.05; flibanserin
32 mg/kg = 289.6 ± 35.3 min; p < 0.01). at 16 mg/kg, i.p., flibanserin also potentiated
diazepam-induced loss of righting reflex in mice (number of mice out of 10 with loss of
righting reflex after 4 or 8 mg/kg i.p. diazepam: vehicle = 2 and 4, respectively; flibanserin 16 mg/kg = 6 and 10, respectively; p < 0.05). at 100 mg/kg, p.o., but not at lower
doses, flibanserin potentiated  xxxd102xxx induced loss of righting reflex in mice (number of
mice out of 10 with loss of righting reflex after 1.6 mg/kg i.p. ethanol: vehicle = 2; flibanserin 100 mg/kg = 8; p < 0.01). however, at this dose, flibanserin did not alter ethanolinduced aerial righting reflex (see ref. 29 for methods).
the fact that flibanserin potentiated either  xxxd285xxx  (mainly excreted as unchanged by
kidney) and pentobarbital (mainly metabolized by the liver) seems to exclude a potential
metabolic interference between flibanserin and these two barbiturates. this suggests that
flibanserin may interact with the macromolecular complex of gaba where the two barbiturates act. this hypothesis is supported also by the finding that flibanserin potentiated the

borsini et al.

effects of other drugs acting as agonists on this gaba macromolecular complex, such as
diazepam and ethanol. however, the interaction of flibanserin with this receptor complex
does not seem to be direct, as suggested by the low affinity of flibanserin for the benzodiazepine receptors, the gaba-a agonist site, and gaba-a cl– channel (table 1). flibanserin failed to increase extracellular concentrations of gaba (table 4). thus, flibanserin
seems to interact with gabaergic transmission indirectly.
in addition, in rats at single doses up to 32 mg/kg i.p., flibanserin does not impair
learning in a water maze (14). at doses up to 64 mg/kg i.p. (maximal dose tested) flibanserin did not produce any relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate of conscious
rats. at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o., flibanserin did not injure gastric mucosa or alter gastrointestinal transit in rats. in rats, at doses up to 30 mg/kg i.p., flibanserin did not alter
basal- or cholinergic stimulation-induced salivation; at 30 mg/kg p.o. it had no effect on
urinary volume or electrolytes.

conclusions
flibanserin is capable of modifying animal behavior at two different dosage levels
(table 17). at doses below 10 mg/kg, it exerts prolongation of rem latency, anti-anhedonic effects, mild analgesia, facilitates exploration in the light/dark test, reduces ultrasound vocalization, antagonizes exploratory activity in bulbectomized rats, reduces psychostimulant-induced hypermotility, and potentiates barbiturate-induced loss of righting
reflex. at these doses, flibanserin seems to exert effects solely by activating 5-ht1a receptors. at higher doses (16 to 40 mg/kg) flibanserin had effects in other tests involving
interactions with other receptors.
the mechanism of action of flibanserin is not the same in all tests. it may directly or indirectly activate 5-ht1a, d1, d2, d4, and ì-opioid receptors. flibanserin also increases the
function of gaba multicomplex receptors. the antagonistic activity of flibanserin at
5-ht2a receptors has been observed in biochemical and electrophysiological tests; it is
less evident in behavioral models. in most behavioral tests flibanserin exerts its maximal
activity for a short period of time, which is in agreement with its half-life. this contrasts
with its longer duration of action observed in some biochemical and electrophysiological
parameters. the only exception in behavioral tests is represented by the activity of
flibanserin in the chronic mild test model in mice, where its activity lasted 18 h (25). the
contribution of potential active metabolite(s) cannot be excluded, and this issue needs to
be elucidated.
the effects on motor activity seem to be test-related at low doses, but sedation is
clearly evident at doses above 32 mg/kg. additionally, flibanserin does not appear to interfere with potential side effects induced by antidepressants, such as serotonergic syndrome (13) and cardiovascular effects (j. van ryn, boehringer ingelheim, data on file).
the fact that flibanserin, in contrast to other 5-ht1a agonists, reduces the activity of
cortical pyramidal cells makes this compound a unique tool to study the physiopathology
of cortical glutamatergic pyramidal cells. this fact, combined with the findings that flibanserin displays antidepressant-, antipsychotic- and probably anxiolytic-like properties,
indicates that this compound may be an interesting psychotropic drug.
