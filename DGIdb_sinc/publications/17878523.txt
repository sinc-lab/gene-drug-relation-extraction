abstract. patient tumor explants established subcutaneously in
serial passage in nude mice were characterized for their sensitivity
towards 11 standard cytotoxic anti-cancer agents. the latter
include the alkylating agents cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,
 xxxd2655xxx  c, cisplatin and  xxxd2502xxx , the antimetabolites 5-fu
and methotrexate; the  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors adriamycin
and etoposide as, well as the tubulin binders paclitaxel and
 xxxd3513xxx . the mean number of tumors treated with any of the
various drugs was 54 (range 31-78). the tumor xenografts’ gene
expression profiles were determined using the affymetrix hgu133 plus 2.0 mrna expression array representing ~38.500
human genes. the hypothesis was that the correlation of drug
response to gene expression would identify gene signatures that
can predict the drug response of individual tumors to these
agents. predictive gene signatures were found and subsequently
verified using the leave-one-out cross-validation (loocv)
technique. tumors were considered as responsive if the drugs
effected a tumor volume inhibition to less than 11-41% of the
volume of vehicle control tumors (t/c%). the median cut-off
over all drugs was a t/c of 25%. using these criteria, on average
one third of the test tumors were sensitive (responders) and two
thirds were resistant (non-responders). the bio-informatic
analysis yielded predictive gene signatures consisting of 42-129
genes (mean for the 11 drugs: 87 genes). on average, the
response rate for predicted responders (83%) was 2.45 fold higher
than that for all test tumors (random testing, 34%). this increase
of response rates, following signature-guided testing, was
consistent for all 11 agents. conversely, 94% of the predicted
non-responders (range: 84-100%) proved to be non-responders
in nude mouse studies while the proportion of non-responders
among all test tumors was approximately 66%. the majority of

genes (59%) making up the predictive gene signatures had an
unknown function. known genes were implicated in cell
proliferation, apoptosis, dna repair, cell cycle, metabolism and
transcription. the predictive gene signatures presented here for 11
cytotoxic agents have the potential, if employed in the clinic, to
substantially increase tumor response rates compared to
empirical drug treatment. however they need to be further
validated, both preclinically and clinically.
cancer chemotherapy is still largely empirical. the response
rates of the various tumor types to given combination or
single agent therapies are well established and are the basis
of standard clinical treatment regimens that aim at
maximizing the chances of therapeutic success for the whole
cancer patient population. because of the diversity of
tumors however, this approach is not necessarily most
effective for the individual patient.
in contrast to the standard approach, the concept of
individualized cancer therapy aims at accurately predicting
the most effective therapy for a given patient. if successful,
this approach would spare the patient adverse effects and
save costs associated with ineffective therapies. numerous
attempts were made to predict the drug sensitivity of a given
tumor by analysing tumor samples obtained from patients in
vitro. for example, the capacity of drugs to inhibit colony
formation by patient-derived tumor cells in agar was used to
identify effective drugs. these approaches, however, were
not generally accepted and are therefore not widely used (1).
an exception is the highly reliable prediction of drug
resistance using an in vitro thymidine incorporation assay (2).
the recent advent of dna microarrays representing the
complete human transcriptome made it possible to derive
global mrna expression profiles of human tumors.
correlation of tumor gene expression profiles with the drug
sensitivities of tumors allows us to derive gene signatures
that are indicative of tumor sensitivity to a given drug.
matching such predictive gene signatures for all registered
drugs with the mrna profile of a given tumor has the
potential to predict which treatment would be most effective
for the tumor in question.

80 comparisons were performed in 55 tumors. xenografts were
predicted correctly for resistance in 97% (57/59) and for remission in
90% (19/21) of cases (from fiebig et al. (4)).

over the years we have established a large collection of
patient tumor explants passaged as subcutaneous tumor
xenografts in nude mice. we have shown earlier (3) that
tumor response in the mouse faithfully recapitulates the
response of the same tumor to the same treatment in the
patient (table i). thus, of 21 tumors that underwent
remission in the patient, 19 tumors also underwent
remission as a tumor xenograft in the mouse if the mouse
received the same treatment as the patient. only 2 tumors
that were sensitive in the patient, did not undergo remission
in the mouse. conversely, of 59 tumors that were resistant
in the patient, 57 tumors were also resistant in the mouse.
overall, the correct prediction for resistance was 97% and
for sensitivity 90%.
using the affymetrix chip hg-u-133 plus 2.0
representing approximately 38.500 human genes (4) we have
now determined the gene expression profiles of 200 patient
tumor xenografts passaged subcutaneously in nude mice. by
correlating tumor sensitivity to 11 registered cytotoxic drugs
with gene expression data, we have derived gene signatures
that can predict tumor sensitivity to the 11 drugs. the next
goal is to develop, for further clinical validation, a custommade chip to assess tumor gene expression and thereby
predict tumor drug sensitivities.

materials and methods
animals. athymic nude mice of nmri genetic background were
either supplied by our own breeding facility or purchased from
bomholtgard, now taconic, ry, dk. in the first passage, tumors
from male patients were implanted into male mice, tumors from
female patients into female mice. all efficacy tests were carried out
in female mice with the exception of testicular and prostate
cancers. all animal experiments were performed according to
german animal license regulations and were approved by the
local authorities.
tumors. from more than 1,600 resected solid human malignancies,
we were able to establish more than 400 tumor models growing
subcutaneously in serial passage in nude mice (5-7). for efficacy
tests, two fragments of 1.5-2 mm in diameter were implanted
subcutaneously into both flanks of each mouse, for tumors inducing

cachexia only one tumor per mouse was implanted. testings were
performed using tumor xenografts in serial passage after their
growth had become regular, for most tumors this was between
passage 2 and 10. tumors were not used for more than 10-15
passages after thawing and implanting tumor pieces from frozen
master stocks. four tumor xenografts used in this study were
established from human tumor cell lines (mcf7, t24, skov3 and
ccrf-cem).
tumor measurements. tumors were measured either weekly or, for
fast growing tumors, twice weekly and volumes were calculated
according to the formula axb2/2 where a is the longest diameter and
b the perpendicular axis. relative tumor volumes were calculated
for each individual tumor according to tumor size on day x divided
by tumor size on day 0, i.e. at randomization, multiplied by 100.
group median relative tumor volumes were used for evaluation.
design of efficacy tests. for efficacy tests, tumor-bearing mice were
selected randomly for the untreated or vehicle treated control
group and the test groups approximately 10-30 days after
implantation when tumors had grown to mean tumor diameters of
6 mm (range: 5-7 mm) equal to a tumor volume of approximately
100 mmñ. each test group consisted of 5 or 6 animals collectively
bearing between 6 and 10 evaluable tumors. the day of
randomization was designated as day 0. day 0 was also the first
day of dosing. the experiments were evaluated after 4 - 6 weeks or
after 2-3 weeks for very fast growing tumors.
chemotherapy. eleven established anti-cancer agents were
administered in monotherapy to tumor-bearing nude mice at dose
levels, schedules and routes as indicated in table ii (4). the
treatment regimens corresponded to clinical schedules with the
exception that treatment in mice was usually repeated after 2 weeks
instead of the 3 or 4 week intervals used in the clinic. two
treatment cycles were given. growth curves of 2 sensitive models
with long term remissions are shown in figure 1. drug dose levels
causing up to 20% lethalities after 3 to 4 weeks were considered as
the maximum tolerable doses in tumor bearing nude mice and were
used as the maximum test dose levels.

evaluation parameters for tumor response. test/control (t/c%)
values, i.e. the ratio of median relative tumor volumes for test and
control groups were calculated for all measurement time points,
and the minimum (optimal) t/c value recorded during an
experiment was taken as the endpoint for evaluation of tumor
sensitivity. mice had to be sacrificed when the volume of their
tumors exceeded 1600 mm3. for all drugs, the tested tumors were
classified either as responders (r) or as non-responders (nr),
depending on the optimal t/c value. the cut-off points differed
for the various drugs (table iv) and were chosen such that the
ratio of r to nr was approximately 1:2, thus roughly matching the
clinical situation and allowing statistically sound correlations of
gene expression and efficacy data.
tumor excision and rna extraction. for mrna preparation,
tumors were grown in untreated mice. following sacrifice of mice
by cervical dislocation, tumors were excised without delay and
tumor pieces free of necrosis were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
following mechanical tissue disruption, total tumor rna was
extracted using the rneasy mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany).
prior to array analysis, one round of t7 promotor-based rna
amplification was performed.
microarrays. affymetrix® hg-u133 plus 2.0 mrna expression
arrays were used to determine the expression of 47,400 transcripts,
corresponding to human 38,500 genes. the hg-u133 plus 2.0
mrna expression arrays have proven high reproducibility for
mrna expression analysis (8).
data preprocessing and normalization. cel result files were preprocessed using the gc-rma (9) algorithm independently for
training and validation sets. chip normalization to the 50th
percentile was performed afterwards.
data analysis. predictive transcripts were identified by an iterative
leave-one-out/intersection process utilizing genespring bioscript
sg2c-2 (agilent, santa clara, us). support vector machines were
used as the class prediction algorithm (10-12).
leave-one-out cross-validation. predictive gene signatures were
generated using the expression profiles and sensitivity data of all n
test tumors as a training set. leave-one-out cross-validation
(loocv) involved removing a single tumor from the original
training set of n tumors and using the remaining n-1 tumors as the
training set and the removed tumor for validation. this procedure
was repeated such that each tumor in the original training set was
used once for validation.

results
efficacy of 11 cytotoxic agents in tumors with known gene
expression profiles. a prerequisite for the derivation of gene
signatures predicting tumor sensitivity towards each of the
11 cytotoxic drugs was the availability for the same tumors
of gene expression profiles and efficacy data for
monotherapy with the 11 drugs. global mrna expression
profiles were determined for approximately 200 different
patient tumor explants passaged as subcutaneous xenografts
in nude mice. the tumors were of various types (table iii),

including mainly non-small cell lung (n=44), colon (38),
kidney (17), breast (12), and head and neck (12) cancers as
well as melanomas (22) and sarcomas (10). efficacy tests for
the various drugs were predominantly carried out in the
subset of tumor types for which the respective drugs are
registered or for which clinical activity has been
demonstrated. the cut-off points for efficacy differed for
the various drugs and were chosen such that the ratio of
responders (r) to non-responsders (nr) was approximately
1:2, thus roughly matching the clinical situation and allowing
statistically sound correlations of gene expression and
efficacy data. an overview over the numbers of tumors
tested, the classification borders and the proportion of
sensitive and resistant test tumors (referred to as r for
responder and nr for non-responder, respectively) for the
various agents is given in table iv.
the alkylating agents cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,
 xxxd2655xxx  c, cisplatin, and  xxxd2502xxx  were tested in a total
of (depending on the drug) 31-78 tumors. the main test
tumor types were non-small cell lung cancer (all 5
compounds), mammary cancer (all compounds except
 xxxd2502xxx ) as well as small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer,
cancer of the testis and melanoma (all compounds except
cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide). the cut-off point for
activity of the various drugs was a tumor volume
inhibition (t/c%) to smaller than (depending on the
drug) 11-34% of the volume of vehicle control tumors.
the proportion of sensitive tumors ranged from
approximately 32 to 42%. about one half of these
responders underwent remission while the volume of most
of the remaining responders was stable (no change). "no
change" still translates into a clinical benefit, especially
since drugs are administered in combination.

the antimetabolites 5-fu and methotrexate were tested in
57 and 28 tumors, respectively. the main test tumor types
for 5-fu were colon, mammary, gastric and pancreatic
cancer. for methotrexate test tumors were evenly distributed
among the various tumor types. the threshold for activity
was set at relatively high optimal t/c values of 40 and 41%,
respectively, taking into account that for both drugs patients
tolerate more than three times the maximum tolerated dose
of mice, based on body surface. using these criteria, 32 and
21% of the tumors were classified as responsive.
the topoisomerase-ii-inhibitors adriamycin and etoposide
were tested in 66 and 42 tumors, respectively. the main test
tumors for both compounds were non-small cell lung
cancer, mammary cancer, for adriamycin in addition small
cell lung, pancreatic, bladder and renal cell cancer and for
etoposide ovarian and testis cancer. tumors showing tumor
volume inhibition to <35% of the vehicle control group
were considered as sensitive which was the case for 35 and
31% of the tested tumors, respectively.
the tubulin binders paclitaxel and  xxxd3513xxx  were tested
in 49 and 68 tumors, respectively, among them
predominantly non-small cell lung and mammary cancers
for both compounds and for  xxxd3513xxx  in addition small cell
lung and gastric cancers. the cut-off points were at
minimum t/c values of 12 and 13%, respectively, and the
proportion of sensitive (responsive) tumors was 41 % for
paclitaxel and 38% for  xxxd3513xxx . as for alkylating agents,
about one half of the responders underwent remission while
the volume of most of the remaining responders was stable.

utility of predictive gene signatures. the efficacies of
 xxxd2655xxx -c and adriamycin in the respective 63 and 66 test
tumors are given in tables v and vi. the derived gene
signatures predicting tumor sensitivities towards the 2 drugs,
as assessed based on leave-one-out cross-validation,
comprise 79 and 115 genes, respectively. out of 26 tumors
predicted to be sensitive to  xxxd2655xxx  c, 20 (77%) were
sensitive in animal testings. for adriamycin, out of 28
tumors predicted to be sensitive, 19 (=68%) actually were.
in summary, if only the tumors predicted to be sensitive had
been tested with  xxxd2655xxx  c and adriamycin, response
rates of 77% (20 out of 26) for  xxxd2655xxx  c and of 68% (19
out of 28) for adriamycin would have been obtained as
compared to response rates of 37% and 35% for random
testing, i.e. using the gene signatures for test tumor
selection, the response rates increased by factors of 2.08 and
2.06 compared with random testings. the correct
predictions for non-responders were 34 out of 37 (92%) for
 xxxd2655xxx  c and 34 out of 38 (89%) for adriamycin. the
proportion of non-responders among all test tumors was 40
out of 63 (63.5%) and 43 out of 66 (65.2%) for  xxxd2655xxx  c
and adriamycin, respectively.
the distribution of the real t/c values among the predicted
 xxxd2655xxx  c and adriamycin responders and non-responders
is presented in figure 2. among the predicted responders, the
median t/c achieved by  xxxd2655xxx  c in real testings was 10%
as compared to 56% for the predicted non-responders. for
adriamycin the median t/c values among predicted
responders and non-responders were 31% and 56%,

respectively. for both  xxxd2655xxx  c and adriamycin, rank sum
tests demonstrated significance of the difference in drug
efficacy among predicted responders and non-responders
(p<0.001). in summary, the utility of the predictive  xxxd2655xxx 
c and adriamycin gene signatures was demonstrated based on
the overall response rates and the median t/c values for
predicted responders and non-responders on the one hand
and randomly tested tumors on the other.

with the same methodology, predictive gene signatures for
9 additional compounds (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,
cisplatin  xxxd2502xxx , 5-fu methotrexate, etoposide, paclitaxel
and  xxxd3513xxx ) were evaluated. for all compounds, the actual
response rate among predicted responders was on average
2.45-fold higher than the response rate for all tumors, i.e. for
random testing. the increase of the response rate ranged
from 2.06- to 4.17-fold for the individual compounds.

fiebig et al: gene signatures and tumor response to cytotoxic drugs

table vi. real and predicted efficacy and cross-validation for adriamycin in human tumor xenografts.

for all 11 compounds, random testings of all tumors
resulted in an average tumor response rate of 34% which
increased to 82% if only the subgroup of gene signaturepredicted responders were tested. gene signature-guided
prediction of resistance (no response) was 94% correct,

i.e. 94% (range: 84-100% for the various compounds) of
the predicted non-responders actually did not respond.
the proportion of non-responders following random
testing was on average only 66%. details are shown in
table vii.

prediction of the  xxxd2655xxx  c and adriamycin responses for
an independent set of 106 additional tumors. in addition to
the 63 and 66 tumors, respectively, whose gene expression
profiles and  xxxd2655xxx  c and adriamycin sensitivities were
used to derive predictive gene signatures, 106 untested
tumors with known gene expression profiles were available.
the predictive gene signatures were used to predict
 xxxd2655xxx  c and adriamycin responses of those tumors.
table viii (for  xxxd2655xxx  c) and ix (for adriamycin) show
the response predictions separately for tumor types known
to be sensitive in the clinic (a) and for tumor types that are
either predominantly resistant or have not yet been tested
clinically (b).
for tumor types considered as  xxxd2655xxx  c-sensitive, 32
out of 70 individual untested tumors (46%) were predicted
to be  xxxd2655xxx  c-sensitive, including 3 out of 4 small cell
lung cancers, 3 out of 4 cervix uteri cancers, 2 out of 4
bladder cancers, 13 out of 28 non-small cell lung cancers, 5
out of 14 colorectal cancers, 1 each of gastric, mammary and
pancreatic cancers and 1 sarcoma. among the 63 tested
tumors used to derive the  xxxd2655xxx  c gene signature (see
above), 47 belonged to  xxxd2655xxx  c-sensitive tumor types.
among those 47 tumors, sensitivity was demonstrated for 23
(49%). in summary, in the case of the  xxxd2655xxx  c-sensitive
tumor types, 55 out of a total of 117 (38%) were either

204

demonstrated or predicted to be sensitive. conversely, for
tumor types clinically considered as  xxxd2655xxx  c-resistant
(or that had never been tested in the clinic), only 3 out of
36 untested tumors (8%) were predicted to be sensitive,
including 2 out of 5 head and neck cancers and 1 leukemia
but no responses were predicted for any of the liver cancers,
renal cell cancers, melanomas and a myeloma (table viii
b). among the 63 tested tumors used to derive the
 xxxd2655xxx  c gene signature (see above), 16 belonged to
 xxxd2655xxx  c-resistant tumor types. among those 16 tumors,
sensitivity was demonstrated for one melanoma only (6%).
summing up for the  xxxd2655xxx  c-resistant tumor types, 4
out of a total of 52 (8%) were either demonstrated or
predicted to be sensitive.
for tumor types expected to be adriamycin-sensitive, 20
out of 54 untested tumors (37%) were predicted as
responsive including 5 out of 5 leukemias, 2 out of 3
sarcomas, 6 out of 20 non-small cell lung cancers, 1 out of 3
mammary cancers, 1 out of 3 small cell lung cancers, 1 out
of 3 bladder cancers, 1 out of 3 pleuramesotheliomas, the
only myeloma and the only testicular cancer (table ix a).
among the 66 previouisly tested tumors used to derive the
adriamycin-specific predictive gene signature (see above), 44
belonged to adriamycin-sensitive tumor types. among those
44 tumors, sensitivity was demonstrated for 17 (39%).

summing up for the adriamycin-sensitive tumor types, 37 out
of a total of 98 tumors (38%) were either demonstrated or
predicted to be sensitive. for tumor types being considered
as resistant in the clinic, only 5 out of 47 untested tumors
(10%) were predicted to be adriamycin-sensitive, among
them 3 out of 11 melanomas (27%), 1 out of 19 colorectal
cancers (5%), and 0/9 renal cancers (table ix b). among
the 66 tested tumors used to derive the adriamycin gene
signature, 22 belonged to adriamycin-resistant tumor types.
among those 22 tumors, sensitivity was demonstrated for 6
tumors (27%). summing up for the adriamycin-resistant
tumor types, 11 out of a total of 74 (15%) were either
demonstrated or predicted to be sensitive.
in summary, when combining the results of real efficacy
tests with the predicted tumor responses, the proportion
of sensitive tumors among clinically sensitive and clinically
resistant tumors was in agreement with clinical data.

function of genes contained in predictive gene signatures. the
genes making up the predictive gene signatures were
identified using an algorithm comprising a combination of
different statistical tests (12). collectively, the genes allow
predictions of tumor drug sensitivities. for the gene
signatures presented here, the mean number of genes per
signature was 87 (range: 42-129). on average 58.9% of
those genes have an unknown function, as apparent from
the fact that they were not annotated to any of the different
functional categories of genes by the gene ontology
consortium (table x). looking at the six functional
categories considered as particularly relevant to oncology, a
mean of 1.5% of the genes per signature were implicated in
cell proliferation, 1.8% in apoptosis, 1.3% in dna repair,
3.4% in cell cycle, 26.1% in metabolism and 10.3% in
transcription. please note that genes can be assigned to
more than one functional class.

discussion
predictive gene signatures for 11 cytotoxic agents. we have
used gene expression profiles and drug sensitivities of
patient-derived tumor xenografts grown in nude mice to
identify gene signatures that can predict tumor sensitivities
to 11 cytotoxic drugs. compared with random testing, the
predictive gene signatures significantly improved tumor
response rates in leave-one-out cross-validation. conversely,
the proportion of resistant tumors was clearly higher among
predicted non-responders as compared to all test tumors.
actual and predicted response rates were substantially
higher for clinically sensitive tumor types as compared to
clinically resistant tumor types. the 11 predictive gene
signatures reported here consist on average of 87 genes
(range: 42-129). for all 11 signatures, the proportion of
genes implicated in metabolism clearly exceeds the
proportion of genes involved in other relevant cellular
processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating
that not only genes directly involved in the mechanism of
drug action impact on tumor sensitivity.
a prerequisite for the validity of our approach to deriving
predictive gene signatures is that gene expression patterns
and drug sensitivities of tumor xenografts remain stable
during tumor passages in mice. while we have shown in
numerous experiments over many years (5) that drug
sensitivities do not change significantly over at least 15
passages, preliminary data indicate that gene expression
profiles also remain stable. thus, correlation coefficients for
mrna profiles of the same tumor at different passages

starting at passage 0 (original patient tumor) up to passage
12 were generally above 0.8 for all transcripts and above 0.9
for the transcripts of the predictive genes (unpublished data).
we estimate that the tumor training sets required to
derive predictive gene signatures should ideally comprise 50
tumors or more. to obtain the necessary tumor numbers, in
this study we included tumors of, depending on the drug, as
many as 6-10 different types. consequently, our signatures
are applicable to all tumor types represented in the training
sets. experiments are underway to generate tumor typespecific gene signatures by admitting only tumors of one
type, e.g. colorectal cancer, to the training set. we expect
that the resulting signatures will be more accurate and
possibly comprise fewer genes.
clinical perspectives of predictive gene signatures derived
from patient tumor explants passaged in nude mice. gene
expression profiles mirror the complexity and diversity of
human tumors. since they are easily accessible, they could
form the basis of individualized cancer therapy. indeed,
by correlating gene expression profiles determined for
patient tumor samples with clinical outcome, gene
signatures have been developed that predict the prognosis
and drug response of human tumors. gene signatures for
the prediction of patient prognosis were published for
breast and non-small cell lung cancers, lymphomas and
mesotheliomas (13-18). diagnostic tests have been
developed by genomic health (oncotype dx, 21 genes
assessed by pcr) and agendia (mamma-print, 70 genes
assessed by array analysis) to identify primary breast

207

cancer genomics & proteomics 4: 197-210 (2007)
cancer patients with a high risk of relapse (19, 20) and to
then decide on adjuvant chemotherapy accordingly. both
tests have now been approved by the fda. they will need
further validation in prospective clinical studies which are
underway. examples of gene signatures for the prediction
of drug response include a 92 gene signature for
docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting in advanced breast
cancer patients (21) and 512 and 30 gene signatures for
the prediction of pathological complete remission,
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer
patients with either gemcitabine,  xxxd2008xxx  and
docetaxel (22) or with paclitaxel/ fluorouracil, doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide (23).
a disadvantage inevitably associated with the use of
clinical data for the generation of predictive gene
signatures is that most patients receive combination
therapies, making it impossible in most settings to derive
gene signatures for monotherapies and to prove how much
a single agent actually contributed to a therapeutic
outcome. in the absence of controls, it is strictly speaking
not even possible to attribute a therapeutic outcome for a
given patient (e.g., stable disease) unequivocally to the
treatment of that patient. these disadvantages can be
avoided using experimental systems such as human tumor
cell lines cultured in vitro. combining the gene expression
profiles of tumor cell lines with their drug sensitivities,
gene signatures were derived that successfully predict
tumor cell sensitivity to monotherapy with investigational
and registered anti-cancer agents (24-26). depending on
the choice of tumor cells for the training set, gene
signatures can be independent of a test cells’ tissue of
origin. interestingly, at least in one instance predictive
gene signatures derived from cultured tumor cell lines
were used successfully to predict the drug sensitivity of
patient tumors (25). on the other hand, tumor cell linebased experimental systems have been criticised for lack of
clinical relevance and are, therefore, not generally
accepted. for example, as a consequence of prolonged in
vitro culture, variants of the cell lines were selected that
are well adapted to rapid in vitro growth but differ from
the original patient tumor. indeed, nude mouse tumor
xenografts derived from most cultured tumor cell lines are
histologically homogeneous and undifferentiated and
differ in this regard from patient tumors. second, the in
vitro culture conditions of tumor cell lines and the assay
parameters (induction of apoptosis and/or inhibition of
cell proliferation on a plastic surface) are not
representative for the clinical situation (inhibition of 3d
tumor growth in the context of tissue).
patient tumor explants passaged in nude mice combine
most of the advantages of the clinic and tumor cell linebased experimental systems and avoid most of the
restrictions. as demonstrated by extensive comparisons

208

of drug sensitivities and histology, the patient tumor
xenografts retain most of the characteristics of the
original patient tumor (5) and the principal assay
parameter, i.e. inhibition of a real tumor, is similar in
patients and mice. on the other hand, in contrast to the
clinic, experiments are rapid and well controlled and
efficacy in a given tumor can be unequivocally attributed
to individual drugs. using this system, predictive gene
signatures can be generated for experimental compounds,
prior to any clinical tests. restrictions for drugs directed
toward tumor stroma components may arise from the fact
that after 2 or 3 passages in the mouse the tumor stroma
is of mouse origin, while the tumor cells themselves are
of human origin. restrictions may also exist for hormonedependent tumors which exhibit relatively low take rates
in mice and whose clinical diversity may not be
adequately represented among nude mouse tumor
xenografts.
in summary, we believe that predictive gene signatures
derived from patient tumor explants passaged in nude mice
have great potential to predict drug sensitivities of patient
tumors and could complement the signatures generated with
clinical data. accordingly, we have initiated the clinical
validation of our signatures, using the gene expression
profiles of patient tumor samples to predict tumor
sensitivities.

conclusion
gene expression profiles represent the diversity and
individuality of human tumors. predictive gene signatures
link tumor gene expression profiles with therapeutic
outcome and therefore have the potential to form the basis
of individulalized cancer therapy.
human tumor explants passaged subcutaneously in nude
mice are a promising system to derive predictive gene
signatures. on the one hand, they faithfully recapitulate the
sensitivity of the original patient tumors to cytotoxic drugs,
a fact indicating their clinical relevance. on the other hand,
they have the advantages of experimental systems, i.e. there
is the capacity to rapidly obtain clean and well controlled
data under defined conditions.
predictive gene signatures for 11 cytotoxic drugs have
been derived using the tumor xenograft system. initial data
generated with these gene signatures are consistent and
plausible. however, validation of the signatures, in
particular for clinical application, is still required.
