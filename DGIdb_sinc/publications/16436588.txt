abstract
abnormal migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) are key events in the pathogenesis of restenosis that undermine the long-term benefit of widely performed
balloon angioplasty and stenting procedures. platelet-derived
growth factor (pdgf) is a potent mitogen and motogen for
vsmcs and is known to play a prominent role in the intimal
accumulation of smooth muscle cells. in this study, we analyzed the effects of a novel protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ), on pdgf-stimulated vsmcs.  xxxd1815xxx  is an orally bioavailable dual src/bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor currently undergoing clinical trials in cancer patients. we found that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited pdgf-stimulated
activation of pdgf receptor (pdgfr), stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  in
rat a10 vsmcs and in primary cultures of human aortic smooth

balloon angioplasty and stenting are widely used procedures for coronary artery disease. unfortunately, renarrowing (restenosis) of the dilated artery occurs in 25 to 40% of
patients within 6 months after these procedures, which requires repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery (dangas and
kuepper, 2002; michaels and chatterjee, 2002). therefore,
restenosis represents a major problem limiting the long-term
efficacy of these revascularization therapies. moreover, after
coronary artery bypass surgery, narrowing (stenosis) of the

muscle cells (aosmcs) at low nanomolar concentrations. the
50% inhibition of the pdgfr␤  xxxg2198xxx  activity in vitro by
 xxxd1815xxx  was observed at 4 nm. direct comparison of
 xxxd1815xxx  and another pdgfr inhibitor, imatinib (gleevec,
sti571), in vsmcs indicated that  xxxd1815xxx  is 67-fold more
potent than imatinib in inhibition of pdgfr activation.  xxxd1815xxx  also inhibited src  xxxg2198xxx  in a10 cells. at the
cell level, pdgf stimulated migration and proliferation of a10
cells and human aosmcs, both of which were inhibited by
 xxxd1815xxx  in a concentration dependent manner in the low
nanomolar range. these results suggest that  xxxd1815xxx  is a
potent inhibitor of pdgf-stimulated vsmc activities and a
potential agent for the development of a new therapy for vascular obstructive diseases such as restenosis.

transplanted artery can also occur that necessitates further
medical treatments.
abnormal migration and proliferation of vsmcs are critical events in the pathogenesis of artery obstructive diseases
such as restenosis (bailey, 2002; sanz-gonzalez et al., 2004;
levitzki, 2005). although several growth factors and cytokines are involved in the development of restenosis, many
lines of evidence have indicated that pdgf plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of restenosis. pdgf is the most
potent mitogen and motogen for vsmcs (heldin and westermark, 1999). pdgf is present at sites of vascular injury
from activated platelets, monocytes, and cells of the artery
wall (raines, 2004). expression of exogenous pdgf in animal arteries can induce intimal thickening through stimulation of vsmc proliferation and migration and synthesis of

squibb. imatinib (gleevec, sti571) was provided by novartis (basel,
switzerland).
cell culture. the a10 rat aortic smooth muscle cell line was
obtained from american type culture collection (manassas, va)
and grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. primary culture of human aortic

smooth muscle cells (aosmcs) was obtained from cambrex  xxxd2146xxx  walkersville, inc. (walkersville, md) and grown in smgm-2
bulletkit medium (cambrex) plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100
␮g/ml streptomycin. human aosmcs were used before the 7th passage. cells were maintained at 37°c in a humidified 95% air and 5%
co2 incubator.
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. cells were lysed
in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl, 25
mm naf, 1 mm  xxxd302xxx , 1% triton x-100, 1 mm na3vo4, 20
mm  xxxd2822xxx , 2 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 2 ␮g/ml aprotinin,
and 100 ␮g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). cell lysate supernatants were obtained by microcentrifugation at 4°c for 15min and the
protein concentration was determined. for immunoblotting analysis
of cell lysates, cell lysate supernatants were heat-denatured in sds
loading buffer. antibodies to activated stat3, activated akt, activated  xxxg1369xxx /2, and  xxxd1075xxx  were used to assess the activation of these molecules and receptor tyrosine kinases by immunoblotting. immunoblotting was performed essentially as described
previously (cunnick et al., 2001, 2002; ren and wu, 2003) using the
supersignal west pico chemiluminescent reagent (pierce, rockford,
il). each immunoprecipitation was performed using 600 ␮g of cell
lysate supernatant, 2 ␮g of specific antibody indicated in the figure
legends, and 30 ␮l of protein-a or protein-g at 4°c for 2 h. immune
complex was collected by microcentrifugation and washed three
times with the lysis buffer. quantification of immunoreactive band
intensity was achieved using the imagequant program (ge healthcare, little chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk).
protein  xxxg2198xxx  assays. pdgfr was immunoprecipitated with an anti-pdgfr antibody (calbiochem). immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with kinase
buffer (50 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 10 mm mncl2, and 0.1 mm na3vo4).
the immune complex kinase assay was performed in a 50-␮l reaction
mixture (kinase buffer plus 20 ␮ci of [␥-32p]atp, and 10 ␮m atp) at
30°c for 15min. kinase reaction was terminated by addition of 17 ␮l
of 4⫻ sds loading buffer and heat-denaturation at 95°c for 10 min.
samples were subjected to 8% sdf-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. phosphorylation was
quantified by filmless autoradiographic analysis or autoradiography.
the immune complex kinase assay for  xxxg2198xxx  was performed as described previously (ren et al., 2004).
cell migration assay. cell migration was measured using the
transwell cell migration assay (ren et al., 2004). transwell cell
culture insert polycarbonate membrane (6.5 mm, 8.0-␮m pore size;
costar, corning, ny) was coated with rat tail type i collagen (10
␮g/ml in pbs) at 4°c for 18 h and air-dried. vsmcs (80% confluent)
were serum-starved in dmem/0.1% bsa for 18 h, detached from
plates by digestion with 1:3 diluted trypsin-edta (invitrogen),
washed with dmem, and resuspended in dmem/0.1% bsa at 5 ⫻
104 cells/ml for a10 cells or 2.5 ⫻ 104 cells/ml for human aosmcs.
cell suspension (0.2 ml per well) was incubated with  xxxd1815xxx  or
solvent (dmso) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for 20 min before
been placed in the upper chamber of transwell. the lower chamber
contained 0.6 ml of dmem/0.1% bsa with or without 5 ng/ml
 xxxd292xxx  (peprotech) and  xxxd1815xxx . after incubation at
37°c/5% co2 for 4 h, cells remaining on the upper membrane surface
were mechanically removed with a cotton swab. migrated cells on the
lower side of membrane were fixed and stained with the hema3
reagents (fisher scientific, swanee, ga) and enumerated under a
microscope in eight randomly chosen fields with a 10 ⫻ 10 lens. each
field for quantification of the migrated cell number has an area of
0.8 ⫻ 0.6 mm.
cell proliferation analysis. a10 cells and human aosmc cells
were seeded in triplicate at 2 ⫻ 104 per plate in 6-cm plates in
dmem/1% fbs with or without  xxxd292xxx  (10 ng/ml). after 24 h
(day 0), cells were treated with dmso (solvent) or 10 to 50 nm
 xxxd1815xxx . medium was changed on day 3. viable cell number was
determined on day 6 as described previously (dorsey et al., 2000).

extracellular matrix (pompili et al., 1995). it is noteworthy
that inhibition of pdgf as well as pdgfr by immunological,
molecular biological, and pharmacological methods can suppress development of restenotic lesions in animal models
(ferns et al., 1991; sirois et al., 1997; myllarniemi et al.,
1999; levitzki, 2005).
imatinib (gleevec, sti571,  xxxd2332xxx ) is the first protein
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that has been successfully developed into a targeted therapy drug. it is currently used to
treat chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor based on inhibition of bcr-abl and c-kit protein tyrosine kinases, respectively (logrono et al., 2004;
deininger et al., 2005). besides bcr-abl and c-kit, imatinib
also inhibits pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx  (buchdunger et al.,
1996; druker et al., 1996). experiments in animals have
shown that imatinib inhibits restenosis after balloon angioplasty and stenosis after allograft (myllarniemi et al., 1999;
sihvola et al., 2003). inhibition of pdgfr by imatinib, however, requires micromolar concentrations in cell-based assays
(buchdunger et al., 1996; sanz-gonzalez et al., 2004).
after the findings by us and others that a src tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, pd180970, and other  xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives could cross-inhibit bcr-abl (dorsey et al.,
2000; wisniewski et al., 2002; huron et al., 2003), several
dual src/bcr-abl inhibitors are now being developed as new
therapeutic agents for cml. one of these is the orally bioavailable  xxxd1815xxx  (lombardo et al., 2004; shah et al.,
2004; burgess et al., 2005; o’hare et al., 2005), which is
currently in clinical trials in cml patients. because the
bcr-abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor imatinib was originally
identified in the screening of pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, we sought to determine whether  xxxd1815xxx  could
also cross-inhibit pdgfr in vsmcs and suppress pdgfstimulated migration and proliferation of vsmcs. we provide evidence here that  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent pdgfr
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor in vsmcs and that it inhibits cellular responses to pdgf in vsmcs at low nanomolar concentrations. these results reveal  xxxd1815xxx  as a potential
agent for development of a new therapy for restenosis and
stenosis, which will help to improve the long-term success of
angioplasty/stenting and coronary bypass surgery.

analysis of a novel pdgf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
for the recovery experiment, cells were treated as above for 6 days
and then cultured without  xxxd1815xxx  for another 6 days.
flow cytometric analysis. a10 cells (80% confluent) were serum starved in dmem/0.1% bsa for 24 h. after which,  xxxd292xxx 
(10 ng/ml) and  xxxd1815xxx  or dmso was added and the incubation
was continued for another 16 h. cells were collected by trypsinization and resuspended in pbs at 5 ⫻ 106 cells/ml. cells were fixed in
cold 70% ethanol, washed with pbs, and incubated with  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide (20 ␮g/ml) and rnase (200 ␮g/ml) for 1 h at room temperature
at a cell concentration of 1 ⫻ 106 cells/ml. flow cytometric analysis
of cell cycle phase distribution was performed using a becton dickinson facscalibur flow cytometer (becton dickinson, san jose,
ca), and 1 ⫻ 104 events were recorded for each sample.

tyrosine phosphorylation was completely blocked by 50 nm
 xxxd1815xxx . in contrast, 5 ␮m imatinib was required to
achieve the same level of pdgfr inhibition in parallel experiments. likewise, complete inhibition of pdgf-stimulated akt and  xxxg1366xxx  activation were observed in cells treated
with 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx  but only with 5 ␮m imatinib,
whereas decrease in stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation appeared at lower concentrations of imatinib (fig. 2a). it is
noteworthy that inhibition of akt by both  xxxd1815xxx  and
imatinib was observed only at the highest drug concentration
tested; pdgfr is a strong activator of the phosphoinositide-3
kinase signaling pathway because it binds phosphoinositide-3 kinase directly. comparison of 50% inhibition of

 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits pdgf-activated signaling
pathways in vsmcs. to determine whether  xxxd1815xxx 
could inhibit pdgfr activation in vsmcs, we treated serum-starved rat a10 cells with  xxxd292xxx  (5 ng/ml) for 0 to 30
min in the presence or absence of 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx . cell
lysates were analyzed for activation of pdgfr␤, stat3,
akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  by immunoblotting analyses (fig. 1a).
pdgfr␤ is the predominant pdgfr subunit in vsmcs
(raines, 2004) and the only functional pdgfr subunit in
a10 cells (rao et al., 1997). stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  signaling
pathways have been reported to mediate pdgf-induced cell
migration and proliferation in vsmcs (graf et al., 1997;
shibata et al., 2003; zhan et al., 2003; neeli et al., 2004; kim
et al., 2005; vantler et al., 2005). pdgf treatment markedly
increased pdgfr␤ tyrosine phosphorylation, which was detectable at the earliest time point examined (1 min).  xxxd1815xxx  (50 nm) effectively blocked pdgf-stimulated
pdgfr␤ tyrosine phosphorylation at all time points examined. figure 1a also shows that stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  were
activated by pdgf in a10 cells as measured by activationspecific phosphorylation and these were inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx .
we next immunoprecipitated pdgfr␤ from a10 cells that
had been treated with  xxxd292xxx  (5 ng/ml, 5 min) in the
presence of 0 to 25 nm  xxxd1815xxx  and then analyzed the
pdgfr tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblotting. as illustrated in fig. 1b, tyrosine phosphorylation of pdgfr was
induced by pdgf stimulation in a10 cells; the response was
inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx  with an ic50 of 3 nm in this assay.
to confirm that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx  activity, pdgfr␤ was immunoprecipitated from a10
cells with or without prior pdgf stimulation (5 ng/ml, 5
min). the pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx  activity was determined in
vitro in the immune complexes by autophosphorylation in the
presence of various concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx . as shown
in fig. 1c,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibited pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx 
activity in a concentration-dependent manner. the 50% inhibition of pdgfr␤ phosphorylation was observed at 4 nm
 xxxd1815xxx .
comparison of pdgfr inhibition by  xxxd1815xxx 
and imatinib. in addition to inhibiting bcr-abl and c-kit,
imatinib also inhibits pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx . to compare
the inhibition of pdgfr in vsmcs by  xxxd1815xxx  and
imatinib, a10 cells were preincubated with various concentrations of  xxxd1815xxx  or imatinib, stimulated with pdgfbb, and activation of pdgfr, stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  were
analyzed. figure 2a shows that pdgf-stimulated pdgfr␤

0 to 30 min in the presence or absence of 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx ,
and the src tyrosine activity was determined by an immune
complex kinase assay using a gst fusion protein of gab1
fragment as an exogenous substrate (ren et al., 2004).  xxxg2198xxx 
isolated from a10 cells without exposure to  xxxd1815xxx  and
pdgf had detectable kinase activity (fig. 4a). this kinase
activity was reduced to a residual level in  xxxg2198xxx  isolated from
 xxxd1815xxx –treated cells (fig. 4a). pdgf treatment did not
lead to a detectable increase in  xxxg530xxx  activity in a10
cells in repeated experiments. nevertheless, as in unstimulated cells, the activity of  xxxg2198xxx   xxxg2198xxx  in pdgfstimulated a10 cells was suppressed by  xxxd1815xxx  to the
residual level (fig. 4a). this result indicated that  xxxg2198xxx  was
basally active in a10 cells and that  xxxd1815xxx  effectively
inhibited the  xxxg530xxx  activity in these cells.
we next treated a10 cells with various concentrations of
 xxxd1815xxx , immunoprecipitated  xxxg2198xxx  and assayed its  xxxg2198xxx  activity to determine the concentration-dependent effect of  xxxd1815xxx  on  xxxg2198xxx  in a10 cells. figure 2b
shows that  xxxd1815xxx  potently inhibited  xxxg2198xxx  tyrosine
kinase in a10 cells. the ic50 for inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx  autophosphorylation was 2.25 nm; the ic50 for inhibition of the exogenous substrate (gst-gab1ct) was 2.0 nm.
 xxxg1145xxx  and egfr in a10 cells are not sensitive to
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibition. besides pdgfr, a10 cells also
express  xxxg1145xxx  and egfr. to assess whether  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases in vsmcs, we examined the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  on these two receptor tyrosine kinases in a10 cells. as shown in fig. 5, igf-1 induced
 xxxg1145xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas egf induced
egfr tyrosine phosphorylation in a10 cells. no detectable
inhibition of  xxxg1145xxx  and egfr tyrosine phosphorylation
was observed when a10 cells were treated with up to 50 nm
 xxxd1815xxx . these data are consistent with a previous report that the ic50s for inhibition of  xxxg1145xxx  and egfr by
 xxxd1815xxx  in the in vitro kinase assays were ⬎5 ␮m and
180 nm, respectively (lombardo et al., 2004).
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits pdgf-stimulated vsmc migration. migration of vsmcs plays a critical role in the
development of restenosis. pdgf is a potent migratory stimulus for vsmcs. transwell cell migration assay was performed to determine the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  on pdgfinduced vsmcs migration. a10 cells had a low basal

stimulated with  xxxd292xxx  (5 ng/ml, 5 min). cell lysate supernatants
were analyzed for activation of pdgfr, stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  by immunoblotting.

pdgfr tyrosine phosphorylation by  xxxd1815xxx  and imatinib in these experiments indicated that  xxxd1815xxx  was
67-fold more potent than imatinib in inhibiting pdgfr tyrosine phosphorylation (fig. 2b).
inhibition of pdgfr in human aosmcs by  xxxd1815xxx . to exclude the possibility that the potent inhibition
of pdgfr by  xxxd1815xxx  is specific to rat vsmcs, we
examined the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  in primary cultures of
human aosmcs. human aosmcs were preincubated with 0
to 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx  and then stimulated with  xxxd292xxx  (5
ng/ml, 5 min). pdgfr tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  were analyzed. pdgf markedly induced pdgfr tyrosine phosphorylation in human
aosmcs (fig. 3). as observed in a10 cells, the pdgf-stimulated pdgfr tyrosine phosphorylation was completely
blocked by 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx .
the primary culture of human aosmcs seemed to have an
elevated level of active stat3 in the absence of pdgf stimulation (fig. 3). nevertheless, stat3 was further activated
by pdgf, which was blocked by  xxxd1815xxx .  xxxd1815xxx ,
however, was unable to reduce the active stat3 to a level
below the basal activation state in human aosmcs. complete inhibition of pdgf-stimulated akt and  xxxg1366xxx  activation
was achieved at 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx  in human aosmcs (fig.
3), which is similar to data obtained in a10 cells (fig. 2).
inhibition of  xxxg2198xxx   xxxg2198xxx  by  xxxd1815xxx 
in vsmcs. to determine whether  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits csrc activity in vsmcs,  xxxg2198xxx  was immunoprecipitated from
serum-starved a10 cells treated with  xxxd292xxx  (5 ng/ml) for

analysis of a novel pdgf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor

migration activity. pdgf (5 ng/ml) stimulated a10 cell migration 7-fold in our assay. this response was inhibited by
 xxxd1815xxx  in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 6, a
and b). consistent with the biochemical data, complete inhibition of pdgf-stimulated a10 cells migration was observed
at 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx .
the primary human aosmcs had a higher basal migration
activity, which is 4 times that of a10 cells. in the presence of

fig. 4. inhibition of src  xxxg2198xxx  by  xxxd1815xxx . a,  xxxg2198xxx  was
immunoprecipitated from serum-starved a10 cells (0) or a10 cells stimulated with pdgf (5 ng/ml) for the indicated time in the presence of
absence of 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx . src kinase activity was determined by
autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of gst-gab1ct in the immune complex kinase assay (ren et al., 2004). after autoradiography, the
filter was used for immunoblotting analysis with an anti-src antibody

pdgf (5 ng/ml), migration of human aosmcs was increased
3-fold. again, pdgf-stimulated human aosmc cell migration was inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx  (fig. 6c).
inhibition of vsmc proliferation by  xxxd1815xxx . to
determine the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  on pdgf-stimulated
vsmc proliferation, rat a10 cells were incubated in medium
containing low serum (1% fbs), pdgf (10 ng/ml), and/or 0 to
50 nm  xxxd1815xxx  for 6 days and viable cell numbers were
determined. as shown in fig. 7a, a10 cell proliferation was
stimulated 5-fold by pdgf.  xxxd1815xxx  effectively inhibited pdgf-stimulated a10 cell proliferation. complete inhibition was achieved at 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx . similar results
were obtained in human aosmcs (fig. 7b).
we next analyzed the effect of  xxxd1815xxx  on pdgfinduced change in cell cycle phase distribution. figure 6c
shows that pdgf decreased the percentage of cells in g1
phase from 88.65 to 65.44%, whereas it increased the percentages of cells in s and g2 phases from 10.4 and 0.99% to
23.83 and 10.74%, respectively. the effect of pdgf was suppressed by  xxxd1815xxx , such that in the percentages of cells
in g1, s, and g2 phases were 88.29, 7.99, and 3.75%, respectively, in cells treated with pdgf in the presence of 50 nm
 xxxd1815xxx  (fig. 7c).
a previous study showed that the pdgfr specific tyrosine
kinase inhibitor ag-1295 could inhibit porcine smc proliferation, and the effect was reversible and not toxic (banai et
al., 1998). to evaluate whether the inhibitory effect of bms-

354825 on a10 cell proliferation is reversible, two sets of a10
cells were treated with 0 to 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx  for 6 days.
after this time,  xxxd1815xxx  was removed from one set of
cells and cells were cultured for another 6 days. viable cell
numbers were determined on day 12. as shown in fig. 7d,
a10 cells proliferation resumed after  xxxd1815xxx  withdrawal. thus, the inhibitory effect of  xxxd1815xxx  on
a10 cell proliferation was reversible, suggesting that  xxxd1815xxx  does not exert a cytotoxic effect on these cells.

a potent inhibitor of pdgf-stimulated cellular responses in
vsmcs. it is possible that inhibition of src  xxxg2198xxx 
could contribute to the inhibitory effects of  xxxd1815xxx  in
vsmcs, such as the stat3 pathway (wang et al., 2000;
bowman et al., 2001). however, biochemical evidence suggests that inhibition of pdgfr plays a major role in suppression of pdgf-stimulated responses in vsmcs by
 xxxd1815xxx .
first, our data show that  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent inhibitor
of pdgfr. the ic50 for inhibition of pdgfr␤  xxxg2198xxx  in pdgf-stimulated a10 cells is 3 nm. a similar ic50 (4
nm) was obtained in the in vitro kinase assay. while this
work was in progress, lombardo et al. (2004) reported the
kinase selectivity profile of  xxxd1815xxx , which showed that
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibited pdgfr in vitro with an ic50 of 28
nm. although lombardo et al. (2004) performed no cell-based
assay in their study, our data and theirs are consistent in
demonstrating that  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent pdgfr inhibitor in vitro. the slight difference in ic50 for inhibition of
pdgfr may reflect different assay conditions used to determine the pdgfr kinase activity between these two studies.
we found that src is basally active in a10 cells and that
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the basal src activity (ic50 ⫽ 2 nm).
src kinase activity may be essential for cellular activities
such as migration (heldin and westermark, 1999). thus,
blocking src activity could contribute to the overall effect of
 xxxd1815xxx  in inhibition of pdgf-stimulated vsmc migration. however, we did not detect measurable pdgf-induced
src activation in a10 cells, whereas marked activation of
pdgfr was readily detectable. thus, src kinase activity
alone is insufficient to account for the higher migratory activity of vsmcs observed in the presence of pdgf. furthermore, although imatinib has no src  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor
activity (druker et al., 1996), it suppressed the pdgf-stimulated activation of pdgfr, stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx  in a10
cells. therefore, inhibition of the pdgfr  xxxg2198xxx 
activity alone could have major effects on blocking pdgfstimulated responses in vsmcs.
several studies have shown that pdgfr inhibitors such as
imatinib and ag-1295 are effective in suppressing restenosis
and stenosis in experimental animals (myllarniemi et al.,
1999; fishbein et al., 2000; sihvola et al., 2003; levitzki,
2005). inhibition of pdgfr in vsmcs by imatinib and ag1295 requires micromolar concentrations (fishbein et al.,
2000; sanz-gonzalez et al., 2004). in contrast, near-complete
inhibition of pdgfr activation and pdgf-stimulated activities in vsmcs was observed with 50 nm  xxxd1815xxx  in this
study. direct comparison of  xxxd1815xxx  and imatinib in
a10 cells indicates that  xxxd1815xxx  is 67-fold more potent
that imatinib (fig. 2). thus,  xxxd1815xxx  is a much more
potent pdgfr inhibitor than imatinib.
inhibition of pdgf-stimulated vsmc proliferation by
 xxxd1815xxx  is reversible. it has been reported that the
 xxxg2413xxx  receptor is not sensitive to
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibition (lombardo et al., 2004). these observations suggest that  xxxd1815xxx  is unlikely to cause unmanageable damage to the vascular system. in support of
this notion, imatinib, which also inhibits pdgfr, does not
cause an adverse effect in the cardiovascular system in cml
patients who have been treated with the drug for more than
4 years (lahaye et al., 2005). the reversibility of the inhibitory effect of pdgf-stimulated vsmc proliferation by bms-

354825 also raises the question of whether  xxxd1815xxx  will
be effective in suppressing restenosis. it is possible that
restenosis-promoting activities peak shortly after vascular
injury and lessen afterward. therefore, one would predict
that vsmc proliferation is not likely to resume when  xxxd1815xxx  is terminated after sufficient period of treatment
unless there is new vascular injury.
 xxxd1815xxx  is currently being developed as an anticancer
drug. we demonstrated here that it is very effective in inhibiting pdgf-stimulated vsmc migration and proliferation.
vsmc migration and proliferation are critical events in the
development of restenosis, which is a major problem for the
long-term efficacy of the widely performed angioplasty and
stenting procedures for coronary artery disease. thus, in
addition to being a promising anticancer drug,  xxxd1815xxx 
is a potential novel therapeutic agent for cardiovascular diseases involving abnormal vsmc activities such as restenosis
and stenosis.
