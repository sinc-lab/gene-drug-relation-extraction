abstract

introduction

the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of
15 chemotherapeutic agents were tested against 146
lactococcus garvieae strains isolated from 1999 to
2006 in japan. the agents used included chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin (em),  xxxd1996xxx ,  xxxd2114xxx , florfenicol, kanamycin, lincomycin
(lcm), norfloxacin, oxolinic acid, orbifloxacin,
ofloxacin,  xxxd2871xxx , streptomycin and tetracycline (tc). of the tested strains, 46 showed high
levels of resistance to em, lcm and tc. twelve of
these strains were detected to be carrying transferable
r-plasmids using a conjugation experiment and,
using southern hybridization, were shown to have
the same structure as the r-plasmid. the remaining
34 resistant strains had a similar dna structure to
that of the r-plasmid as confirmed by polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) using primers designed from
sites in the transferable r-plasmid. the em and tc
resistance genes were classified into the ermb and tets
groups using pcr. we also detected gyra and/or
parc mutants that are highly resistant to old and new
generation quinolones. this study revealed that
transferable r-plasmids encoding em, lcm and
tc are widely distributed and are conserved
regardless of the area and/or time of collection.

lactococcus garvieae is a gram-positive bacterium
that causes lactococcosis in yellowtail, seriola
quinqueradiata temminck and schlegel, rainbow
trout, oncorhynchus mykiss (walbaum), and giant
freshwater prawn, macrobrachium rosenbergii (de
man), and has become a problem worldwide
(kitao 1993; kusuda & salati 1999; kawanishi,
kojima, ishihara, esaki, kijima, takahashi, suzuki
& tamura 2005; vendrell, balcazar, ruiz-zarzuela, de blas, girones & muzquiaz 2006). the
pathogen was first reported in fish farms in japan
in 1976 (kusuda, kawai, toyoshima & komatsu
1976) and several antibiotics such as macrolide
antibiotics (mls), lincomycin (lcm) and tetracycline (tc) have been used to treat it (aoki,
takeshita & kitao 1983). in the early 1980s,
l. garviae was sensitive to the antibiotics used,
however, strains of l. garvieae resistant to mls
and tc were isolated in 1986 and were found to
carry transferable r-plasmids. this plasmid is well
known to encode mls and tc (aoki, takami &
kitao 1990).
in the present study, we isolated drug-resistant
strains of l. garvieae in marine farms in japan
sampled from 1999 to 2006 and determined
whether they carry transferable r-plasmids (and
examined them for the presence of transferable rplasmids). we compared the structure of detected
r-plasmids by southern hybridization, and confirmed the existence of mls (lcm) and tc
resistance genes using colony-hybridization analysis. the mutation in the quinolone resistancedetermining regions (qrdr) in gyra and parc
genes of the quinolone-resistant strains was also
analysed.

materials and methods

bacterial strains and plasmid
one hundred and forty-six strains of l. garvieae were
isolated from marine farms in shikoku and kyushu
islands of japan from 1999 to 2006 (table 1). these
strains were cultured in todd hewitt broth (difco,
detroit, mi, usa) and 2% nacl at 25 c. enterococcus faecalis strain og1ss (franke & clewell
1981) was used as the recipient cell for transferable
r-plasmid using todd hewitt broth (difco) at
37 c. escherichia coli strain jm109 was grown in
2x yeast tryptone (2x yt) broth or luria-bertani
(lb) broth (sambrook & russell 2001).
determination of chemotherapeutic
susceptibility
to determine the susceptibility of the 146 strains to
chemotherapeutants, the following drugs were used:
chloramphenicol (cp), ciprofloxacin ( xxxd1706xxx ),
erythromycin (em),  xxxd1996xxx  (enx),  xxxd2114xxx ,
florfenicol (ff), kanamycin (km), lcm, norfloxacin ( xxxd2692xxx ), oxolinic acid (oa), orbifloxacin
(obfx), ofloxacin ( xxxd2772xxx ),  xxxd2871xxx 
(pcg), streptomycin (sm) and tc. determination
of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was
performed by a standard agar dilution method
(japanese society of antimicrobials for animals, the
committee 2003).
conjugation

journal compilation

to determine whether a strain had transferable rplasmid, it was mixed with e. faecalis (og1ss) and
the mixed culture incubated for 18 h at 37 c
(aoki et al. 1990). bacterial concentrations used for
l. garvieae and e. faecalis were 2 · 106 to
1 · 108 cfu ml)1 and 2 · 108 cfu ml)1,
respectively. conjugation was carried out in todd
hewitt broth (difco) at 37 c. r-plasmids were
462

detected by the membrane filter method (burdett
1980). transconjugant strains were selected by
culture in medium containing 150 lg ml)1 of sm
and 200 lg ml)1 of em or in medium containing
25 lg ml)1 of tc.
comparison of detected r-plasmids
transferable r-plasmid dna was extracted from
recipient e. faecalis (og1ss) strains by alkaline
lysis (sambrook & russell 2001) and purified by
caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation.
the isolated transferable r-plasmids were cut with
sau3ai and detected by southern blot hybridization using pkl0018 as a probe. pkl0018 was
isolated from l. garvieae (emr, lcmr and tcr)
collected in 2000 from kagoshima, japan. sau3aidigested dna fragments were transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (hybond-n+; amersham
pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj, usa). dna
probes were labelled with a-32p dctp (amersham
pharmacia biotech) by using a random primer
dna labelling kit ver.2.0 (takara, otsu, japan).
hybridization was performed at 65 c in quick
hybridization buffer (amersham pharmacia biotech). resistant strains of l. garvieae with nondetected transferable r-plasmids were screened
using colony hybridization with em (lcm) and
the tc resistance gene from pkl0018.
for the em- and tc-resistant strains, where
transfer of r-plasmids was not confirmed, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers were designed
for five sites in pkl0018 (table 2). these primers
were used as markers to detect the same five sites of
the r-plasmids in the drug-resistant strains of
l. garvieae by pcr amplification (accession no.
ab290882). primers were similarly designed to
amplify the ermb and tets genes of pkl0018, which
were used as probes for colony hybridization of
em- and tc-resistant strains. pcr conditions were
one cycle of denaturation at 95 c for 5 min,
followed by 30 cycles of annealing at 95 c for
30 s, 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 1 min, and a
final cycle extension at 72 c for 5 min. the
hybridization procedure and conditions were as
described above.

degenerate primer pairs were designed for the gyra
and parc genes of l. garvieae. with the partial

cloned into pgem t-easy vector (promega,
madison, wi, usa) and sequenced using a

the 146 strains of l. garvieae showed varying
susceptibility to the 15 chemotherapeutic agents
(table 3). the strains were grouped as sensitive,
moderately sensitive and resistant following the
categories of aoki et al. (1990). all strains showed
only one group for cp, ff and pcg, and sm and
km, i.e. sensitive and moderately resistant, respectively. for em, 98 strains were sensitive, two were

moderately resistant and 46 were highly resistant.
for both lcm and tc, 100 strains were sensitive
and 46 were resistant. against oa, an older
generation quinolone, the strains showed low
susceptibility while with the new generation types
( xxxd1706xxx , enx,  xxxd2114xxx ,  xxxd2692xxx , obfx and  xxxd2772xxx ), they
showed susceptibility. however, there were some
strains which showed relatively low susceptibility to
these newer types.
conjugation and detection
of the 46 resistant strains that had resistance
markers for emr, lcmr, tcr, 12 were able to
transfer r-plasmids to e. faecalis (og1ss). the 12
transferred r-plasmids were confirmed to encode
the resistance markers em, lcm and tc, and
exhibited similar digestion and southern hybridization patterns (fig. 1). the other 34 resistant strains
that could apparently not transfer r-plasmids to
e. faecalis (og1ss) were further tested using pcr.
using the primers designed from the five regions of
pkl0018, we amplified the regions from these
resistant strains (fig. 2), suggesting the presence of
transferable r-plasmids.
colony hybridization
erythromycin (lcm) and tc resistance genes
encoded by pkl0018 have been classified into the
ermb and tets groups, respectively (accession no.

discussion

streptococcus infection caused by l. garvieae
occurred in 1986 and 1987 in marine farms in
japan. follow-up studies on this phenomenon by
aoki et al. (1990) revealed the appearance of drugresistant strains of l. garvieae encoding em, cp
and/or tc resistance. furthermore, two types of
transferable r-plasmids were detected in the strains,
one encoded with em and cp and the other with
em and tc resistance markers. in this study, we
analysed strains collected from 1999 to 2006 from
fish farms where cp use was not allowed by the
japanese authorities. as expected, we did not detect
cp-resistant strains or transferable r-plasmids
encoding em and cp resistance in these samples,

suggesting that cp presence in these farms had
declined.
of the 46 drug-resistant strains, only 12 carried
r-plasmids that could be transferred to e. faecalis.
the remaining 34 strains could not transfer
r-plasmids but were shown by pcr to possess
the gene contained in the r-plasmid. this suggests
that either these 34 strains are carrying transferable
low frequency r-plasmids or the r-plasmid is
integrated in the chromosome. confirming the fate
of r-plasmids in recipient cells would be an
interesting topic for future studies.
our isolates were composed of moderately emresistant (2) and em-resistant (46) strains classified
466

into the ermb group. however, the moderately
em-resistant strains did not transfer r-plasmids to
e. faecalis og1ss and did not hybridize with the
ermb gene. we speculate that these two moderately
em-resistant strains belong to another group,
separate from the known em-resistant groups,
and that they probably encode different resistance
gene(s).
oxolinic acid has been widely used to treat gramnegative bacterial infections in fish, which has
resulted in the appearance of several oa-resistant
strains in bacteria such as aeromonas salmonicida
subsp. salmonicida, edwardsiella tarda, flavobacterium psychrophilum, photobacterium damselae subsp.

piscicida and environmentally isolated aeromonas
hydrophila, which were shown to have mutations in
the qrdr of gyra and parc (oppegaard & sorum
1994; goni-urriza, arpin, capdepuy, dubois,
caumette & quentin 2002; izumi & aranishi
2004; kim, hirono & aoki 2005; ozanne, benveniste, tipper & davies 2005). however, oa or
any new generation quinolones have not been used
to treat l. garviae infection nor is it permitted in
japanese aquaculture (aoki 1992). in this study we
found some gyra and/or parc mutant strains that
showed low susceptibility to quinolones including
new generation types. these mutants resemble other
resistant gram-positive bacteria such as s. pneumoniae, s. oralis (gyra), s. mitis and e. faecalis (parc)
(tankovic, perichon, duval & courvalin 1996;
gonzalez, georgiou, alcaide, balas, liñares & de la
campa 1998; onodera, okuda, tanaka & sato
2002). the reason for the appearance of quinolone
resistant l. garvieae strains is unknown and certainly
warrants further study.
we isolated strains of l. garviae in various areas
in japan and at different times. however, colony
and southern hybridization detected transferable
r-plasmids in 46 strains with the same structural
features. in addition, all the strains were found to
encode the drug resistance markers em, lcm, tc
regardless of geographical location. this suggests
that the r-plasmids are widely distributed and are
conserved regardless of geographic area and/or
time of collection. this study confirms previous
work on the development of resistance in l. garvieae strains collected in 1986 and 1987 (aoki
et al. 1990).
