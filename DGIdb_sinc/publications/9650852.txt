abstract
recent studies have shown that cyclooxygenase exists in two isozyme forms. since differences in the pharmacological profiles of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs žnsaids. might be accounted for by varying degrees of selectivity for these isozymes,
 xxxg1883xxx  and -2, the relative potency of various nsaids in inhibiting their activities was examined in intact human cells. we
used human platelets  xxxg1883xxx  and interleukin-1 b-stimulated human synovial cell  xxxg1884xxx  for measuring cyclooxygenase selectivity. the presence of the enzymes was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analysis, and by the reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. mean ic 50 values ž m m. for human platelet  xxxg1883xxx  and interleukin-1 b-stimulated
human synovial cell  xxxg1884xxx  and cyclooxygenase-1r-2 ic 50 ratio of various nsaids were as follows: aspirin, 3.2, 26, 0.12;
diclofenac, 0.037, 0.00097, 38;  xxxd2065xxx , 122, 0.68, 179; ibuprofen, 3.0, 3.5, 0.86; indomethacin, 0.013, 0.044, 0.30; loxoprofen žactive

1. introduction
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs žnsaids. produce their therapeutic and toxic effects by decreasing the
biosynthesis of prostaglandins and other proinflammatory
agents žvane, 1971.. nsaids decrease the production of
proinflammatory prostaglandins by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin  xxxg930xxx  synthase žflower et al.,
1972.. recent studies have shown that cyclooxygenase
exists in two isozyme forms žxie et al., 1991; kujubu et
al., 1991. which differ in their basal expression, tissue
localization, and induction during inflammation žvane and
botting, 1996..  xxxg1883xxx  is constitutively expressed and has been detected in every cell type examined
to date žo’neill and ford-hutchinson, 1993.. the level of

quantitative  xxxg1883xxx  mrna studies, shows little
change during the inflammatory process žcrofford et al.,
1994.. in contrast,  xxxg1884xxx  expression is nearly
undetectable in unstimulated cells, but is inducible, and its
induction coincides with an increase of inflammatory
prostaglandins in vivo žmasferrer et al., 1994.. the expression of  xxxg1884xxx  varies in magnitude over the
course of the inflammatory response žappleton et al.,
1994; anderson et al., 1996.. the existence of these two
cyclooxygenase isozymes with different characteristics may
help explain differences in the pharmacological profiles of
various nsaids and may have important clinical consequences. it has been proposed that  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition in gastric mucosal cells and the resultant decreased
synthesis of prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  with loss of a local protective effect accounts for the significant gastric toxicity of
nsaids žemery, 1996.. similarly,  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition in renal cells decreases prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  synthesis
and causes loss of the regulation of vital renal functions,

88

s. kawai et al.r european journal of pharmacology 347 (1998) 87–94

which may account for the renal toxicity of nsaids
žinoue et al., 1994..  xxxg1884xxx  activity, which
parallels the onset of inflammation and produces proinflammatory substances, is clearly a more selective therapeutic target for nsaids.
differences in the pharmacological profiles of various
nsaids might be accounted for by varying degrees of
selectivity for  xxxg1883xxx  and -2. previous studies
have compared the selective inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx 
and -2 by nsaids using various systems. they were
categorized into intact cell systems using murine
macrophages žmitchell et al., 1994. or non-human cell-lines
transfected with human cyclooxygenase genes žlaneuville
et al., 1994; riendeau et al., 1997. or human whole blood
žglaser et al., 1995; brideau et al., 1996; riendeau et al.,
1997. or human mononuclear cells and platelets žgrossman et al., 1995., or enzyme systems using cyclooxygenases derived non-human tissues žmitchell et al., 1994;
yamazaki et al., 1997. or human recombinant cyclooxygenases žlaneuville et al., 1994; glaser et al., 1995.. the
relative potency and selectivity of some nsaids in these
models appears to correspond with their gastric toxicity,
with the more  xxxg1884xxx -selective agents exhibiting lower incidence of gastric injury žhayllar and bjarnason, 1995..
 xxxg1884xxx  in the synovial cells of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis plays an important role in the inflammatory process žsano et al., 1992.. since arthritis is one of
the major clinical applications of nsaids, the present
study was designed to characterize the  xxxg1883xxx 
and  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitory activities of various
nsaids using human platelets and synovial cells.

3.2. western blotting for  xxxg1883xxx  and -2
the anti- xxxg1883xxx  antibody recognized a band
of approximately 70 kda in human platelets, while the
anti- xxxg1884xxx  antibody did not recognize any band
in the same sample žfig. 2, panel a.. in contrast, the
anti- xxxg1883xxx  antibody recognized a weak band in
human synovial cells cultured with or without 1 ngrml of
interleukin-1 b . the  xxxg1884xxx  band was visible at
a position of approximately 70 kda in human synovial
cells without interleukin-1 b stimulation, and it was enhanced by the addition of interleukin-1 b žfig. 2, panel b..
3.3. immunoprecipitation of  xxxg1883xxx  and -2 in

in the present study, we established a reliable assay
system to measure the inhibitory effects of nsaids on
 xxxg1883xxx  and -2 for clinical utilization. previous
studies on cyclooxygenase selectivity have been performed
using purified žmitchell et al., 1994; yamazaki et al.,
1997. or recombinant žlaneuville et al., 1994; glaser et

al., 1995. enzymes and thus were likely to be influenced
by assay conditions, such as the incubation time žlaneuville et al., 1994.. it has been suggested that assays using
intact cells are the most inclusive approach to screening
for cyclooxygenase selectivity žlaneuville et al., 1994.. in
addition, morita et al. ž1995. reported that intracellular
 xxxg1883xxx  and -2 had different properties in murine
3t3 cells, which meant that nsaid activity detected by
enzymatic assays might be different from that detected by
cellular assays.
previous studies employing intact cells for measuring
human cyclooxygenase selectivity utilized cos-7 cells
žlaneuville et al., 1994. or chinese hamster ovarian cells
žriendeau et al., 1997. transfected with human  xxxg1883xxx  or -2 and human whole blood cells žglaser et al.,
1995; brideau et al., 1996; riendeau et al., 1997. or
mononuclear cells and platelets žgrossman et al., 1995..
to obtain more relevant information for clinical use, we
employed human platelets to assess  xxxg1883xxx  and
interleukin-1 b-stimulated human synovial cells as  xxxg1884xxx  when measuring the cyclooxygenase selectivity of various nsaids.
we first tried to confirm that these cell systems were
appropriate for measuring  xxxg1883xxx  or -2 activity.
human platelet lysates entirely contained  xxxg1883xxx 
by western blot analysis, as is generally reported žvane
and botting, 1996.. in human synovial cells, cyclooxygenase activity determined by the prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  concentration after addition of  xxxd208xxx  was dose-dependently enhanced by interleukin-1 b and  xxxg2296xxx  , whereas
interleukin-2,  xxxd3054xxx , interleukin-6, and interferon g
had no effect. since interleukin-1 and  xxxg2296xxx  are key
cytokines associated with pathophysiology in rheumatoid
arthritis žarend and dayer, 1995., induction of cyclooxygenase and resultant prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  overproduction induced by these cytokines may play an important role in
synovial inflammation in this disease. we further examined whether  xxxg1883xxx  or -2 was induced in synovial cells by interleukin-1 b . from the results of western

s. kawai et al.r european journal of pharmacology 347 (1998) 87–94

blotting, immunoprecipitation, and rt-pcr, it appeared
that interleukin-1 b mainly induced  xxxg1884xxx  in
cultured human rheumatoid synovial cells as was also
reported by crofford et al. ž1994.. these results suggested
that interleukin-1 b-stimulated human synovial cells were
suitable for measuring the inhibitory activities of nsaids
for human  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme.
the ratio of the ic 50 values of each nsaid for platelet
 xxxg1883xxx  assay and interleukin-1 b-stimulated
synovial cell  xxxg1884xxx  gives an indication of  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity. ns-398 was the most  xxxg1884xxx  selective agent, and it has already been shown
to be a highly selective  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor in
animal studies žfutaki et al., 1993. and in vitro experiments žfutaki et al., 1994.. among other drugs which are
available for clinical use in japan,  xxxd2065xxx  and diclofenac
sodium had a high  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity in our
assay. zaltoprofen, loxoprofen-srs, and ibuprofen had
intermediate  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity, while the lowest  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity was observed for indomethacin, aspirin, and  xxxd2807xxx .
several investigators have suggested that  xxxg1884xxx -selective nsaids may have greater clinical utility because of their lesser gastric and renal toxicities and
weaker effect on platelet function compared to non- xxxg1884xxx -selective nsaids žappleton et al., 1994;
vane and botting, 1996.. thus, the most important information for the clinical application of cyclooxygenase-2selective inhibitors is whether such agents have any clinical superiority in their riskrbenefit ratio. ns-398, the most
 xxxg1884xxx -selective agent in our study, has potent
analgesic and antipyretic effects with minimal gastric complications in a rat adjuvant arthritis model žfutaki et al.,
1993., however, it is not available for clinical use yet. as
clinically available nsaids, henry et al. ž1996. reported a
meta-analysis of the risk of severe gastrointestinal complications with several kinds of nsaids in 12 clinical studies. they categorized various nsaids into three relative
risk groups: the low-risk group comprised ibuprofen and
diclofenac; the intermediate-risk group was aspirin,  xxxd3259xxx , naproxen, higher doses of ibuprofen, and indomethacin; and the high-risk group included  xxxd2969xxx ,
 xxxd2423xxx ,  xxxd3396xxx , and azapropazone. in the present
study, diclofenac had high, ibuprofen had intermediate,
and indomethacin and aspirin had low  xxxg1884xxx 
selectivity. very recently, singh et al. ž1997. reported a
comparative study of serious gastrointestinal toxicity of
nsaids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in north
america. the rank order of incidence rates of the serious
gastrointestinal toxicity of matched nsaids with our study
was  xxxd2065xxx , diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and
 xxxd2807xxx , which was exactly the same rank order as the
 xxxg1884xxx  selectivity in our study. these findings
suggest that the  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity of nsaids
might influence the relative risk of severe gastrointestinal
complications.

in the present study,  xxxd2065xxx  was one of more  xxxg1884xxx -selective agents among the clinically available nsaids in our human platelet and synovial cell
assays. lanza et al. ž1987. compared the gastrointestinal
mucosa of male volunteers after oral administrations of
several nsaids for 7 days. subjects treated with indomethacin, ibuprofen, and naproxen had significantly worse
gastric and duodenal endoscopy scores when compared
with those given  xxxd2065xxx  and placebo. syntheses of gastric and duodenal mucosal prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  , prostaglandin
i 2 , and thromboxane b 2 in biopsy specimens from patients
with rheumatoid arthritis were significantly suppressed by
naproxen treatment for 4 weeks žlaine et al., 1995., while
 xxxd2065xxx  had almost no effect on these parameters. these
results also suggest that higher  xxxg1884xxx  selectivity may result in considerably less gastrointestinal complications for nsaids.
