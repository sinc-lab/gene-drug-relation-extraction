electrostatic contributions of aromatic residues in the
local anesthetic receptor of voltage-gated
sodium channels
christopher a. ahern, amy l. eastwood, dennis a. dougherty, richard horn
abstract—antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, and local anesthetics target voltage-gated sodium channels, decreasing
excitability of nerve and muscle cells. channel inhibition by members of this family of cationic, hydrophobic drugs
relies on the presence of highly conserved aromatic residues in the pore-lining s6 segment of the fourth homologous
domain of the channel. we tested whether channel inhibition was facilitated by an electrostatic attraction between
lidocaine and ␲ electrons of the aromatic rings of these residues, namely a cation-␲ interaction. to this end, we used
the in vivo nonsense suppression method to incorporate a series of unnatural phenylalanine derivatives designed to
systematically reduce the negative electrostatic potential on the face of the aromatic ring. in contrast to standard point
mutations at the same sites, these subtly altered amino acids preserve the wild-type voltage dependence of channel
activation and inactivation. although these phenylalanine derivatives have no effect on low-affinity tonic inhibition by
lidocaine or its permanently charged derivative qx-314 at any of the substituted sites, high-affinity use-dependent
inhibition displays substantial cation-␲ energetics for 1 residue only: phe1579 in rnav1.4. replacement of the aromatic
ring of phe1579 by cyclohexane, for example, strongly reduces use-dependent inhibition and speeds recovery of
lidocaine-engaged channels. channel block by the neutral local anesthetic  xxxd305xxx  is unaffected by the distribution
of ␲ electrons at phe1579, indicating that our aromatic manipulations expose electrostatic contributions to channel
inhibition. these results fine tune our understanding of local anesthetic inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels and
will help the design of safer and more salutary therapeutic agents. (circ res. 2008;102:86-94.)

oltage-gated sodium channels underlie the upstroke and
propagation of the action potential in excitable cells of
nerve and muscle, making them ideal targets in pharmacological interventions for cardiac arrhythmias, epilepsy, and
pain. antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, and local anesthetics
comprise a family of sodium channel inhibitors that share
chemical and structural similarity. all sodium channel isoforms, including the cardiac channel  xxxg2028xxx , are inhibited by
these compounds,1–3 with differences in sensitivity largely
attributed to divergent biophysical aspects of gating kinetics.3
at physiological ph values, these inhibitors are typically
lipid-soluble cations that are highly efficacious in the treatment of hyperexcitability disorders because of the preference
of the inhibitors for inactivated channels, a conformational
state that is prevalent during high-frequency firing of action
potentials. this state-dependent inhibition is rationalized by
models that propose that inactivation exposes a high-affinity
binding site.
a general deficiency of this class of compounds is their
lack of specificity. for example, the antiepileptic drug car-

bamazepine may adversely effect cardiac rhythms4,5 but has
also been used for pain management.6 multiple sites of
action, whether expressly intended or not, are common to
many of these inhibitors and arise from the highly conserved
nature of both the compounds and their binding site within
the channel where the 3 aromatic residues of relevance for the
present study are 100% conserved across eukaryotic voltagegated sodium channel isoforms.
an abundance of experimental data implicates pore-lining
residues of the s6 segment of domain 4 (d4) of the sodium
channel ␣ subunit in the binding of local anesthetics. alaninescanning mutagenesis has exposed the crucial role of 2 d4/s6
aromatics, phe1579 and tyr1586 (rnav1.4 numbering), in the
block by the anticonvulsant etidocaine and the quaternary
amine qx-314.1 further study has revealed a near universal
importance of these 2 aromatic residues in the inhibition of
sodium channels by the class 1a and 1b antiarrhythmic drugs
and anticonvulsants.7
these 2 residues are ideally placed to interact with drugs
that inhibit channel function. sodium channel pore domain

ahern et al
models based on the crystal structures of potassium channels
predict that both residues face the inner vestibule of the
permeation pathway, where they could interact readily with
cationic blockers and are in close proximity to the selectivity
filter where they might influence sodium permeation.8,9 the
mechanistic details of local anesthetic action, although poorly
resolved, may involve electrostatic repulsion of sodium ions
at the selectivity filter,10 pore occlusion,11 stabilization of
nonconducting states of the channel, or a combination of all
3 mechanisms, in addition to other possibilities such as gating
charge immobilization.12 the additional relevance of these
aromatic residues to channel function is readily seen in
experiments in which outright side chain replacement, for
example, with either alanine or cysteine, not only disrupts
inhibition by local anesthetics but also perturbs the biophysics of channel gating,1,13–15 possibly obscuring the interpretation of their involvement in channel inhibition.
how do neutral aromatic residues contribute to channel
inhibition by organic cations? one proposed but untested
possibility is that local anesthetics have an electrostatic
attraction to the negative electrostatic potential on the face of
pore-lining aromatic side chains,2 a so-called cation-␲ mechanism. this hypothesis can be tested directly using the in vivo
nonsense suppression method, which allows for the sitedirected incorporation of subtly altered variants of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine.16 if a cation-␲ mechanism
contributes to the attraction between a cationic blocker and
the aromatic side chain, reduction of ␲ electron density on the
face of the aromatic, for example, by fluorinating the aromatic ring, will reduce the binding affinity.17 a benefit of this
approach is that fluorination does not substantially alter the
polarizability, size, shape, or hydrophobicity of the side
chain.17,18 therefore, this benign manipulation of side chain
structure obviates the inconvenient functional consequences
of standard mutagenesis. this strategy has been applied
successfully in sodium channels to test for cation-␲ interactions between an extracellular aromatic residue and either
tetrodotoxin19 or calcium ions.20
in this study, we used progressively fluorinated phenylalanine derivatives and the unnatural amino acid cyclohexylalanine (cha), in which the aromatic ring is replaced by
nonaromatic cyclohexane. synthetic residues were substituted into 3 positions of the d4/s6 segment of the rnav1.4
voltage-gated sodium channel, and in each case, channels
showed robust expression with normal voltage dependence
and kinetics of both activation and fast inactivation. only 1
site, phe1579, exhibited a strong cation-␲ interaction with
lidocaine. furthermore, we found that channel inhibition by
the neutral local anesthetic  xxxd305xxx  was unaffected by
manipulations that affected the electrostatic potential on the
aromatic face of phe1579. these experiments establish a
substantial electrostatic component in the binding energy
between cationic local anesthetics and a single pore-lining
aromatic. this careful dissection of the energetic factors
underlying the binding of these inhibitory compounds to
sodium channels holds promise for the synthesis of more
specific therapeutic agents for treatment of disorders of
hyperexcitability.

materials and methods
molecular biology and unnatural amino acids
the in vivo nonsense suppression methodology was performed as
described previously.19,21,22 in brief, the corresponding dna sequences for tyr1574, phe1579, or tyr1586 of the rnav1.4 cdna
were mutated into a tag nonsense (stop) codon by conventional
mutagenesis (stratagene), and complementary mrna was transcribed from this cdna (mmessage mmachine ultra, ambion).
unnatural amino acids were protected with nitroveratryloxycarbonyl, activated as the cyanomethyl ester, coupled to the dinucleotide dca, and then ligated to a modified transfer (t)rna from
tetrahymena thermophila. this trna contains the complementary
anticodon to the uag stop site within the rnav1.4 tag construct
crna. as a control for spurious expression of sodium channels
containing the tag sequence, the dinucleotide dca lacking an
appended amino acid was also ligated to the trna. deprotection of
the aminoacylated trna (trna-aa) was performed by uv irradiation immediately before injection into stage v to vi xenopus
oocytes. typically, 20 ng of trna-aa, 25 ng of rnav1.4-tag crna,
and 2 ng of sodium channel ␤1 subunit crna23 were coinjected in a
50-nl volume into each oocyte.
the present study used phenylalanine derivatives with 1, 2, or 3
appended fluorines, termed 3-f-phe (single fluorination at the 3
position), 3,5-f2-phe (fluorination at the 3 and 5 positions), and
3,4,5-f3-phe (fluorination at the 3, 4, and 5 positions).

electrophysiology
whole oocyte sodium current was recorded with the
2-microelectrode voltage clamp technique using an oc-725c voltage clamp (warner instruments, hamden, conn) in a standard
ringers solution (in mmol/l): 116 nacl, 2 kcl, 1 mgcl2, 0.5 cacl2,
5 hepes, ph 7.5. recording electrodes were filled with a 3 mol/l
kcl solution and had a resistance ⱕ1 m⍀. solutions were changed
with an ala vm8 gravity-flow delivery system (ala scientific). a
200-mm lidocaine stock in ethanol was stored at ⫺20°c, and
working dilutions were made each day from this stock. summarized
data are presented as means⫾sem.

results

although a cation-␲ interaction has been proposed to occur
between local anesthetics and d4/s6 aromatics,2 this hypothesis remains entirely unsubstantiated, and we therefore tested
this possibility directly. lidocaine, like most local anesthetics, can exist in 2 forms, neutral or cationic. at physiological
ph values, roughly three-quarters of lidocaine molecules
carry a ⫹1 charge, and the protonated form is a stronger pore
blocker.24 –26 figure 1a shows the protonated form of lidocaine and a color-coded map of the electrostatic potential on
the surface of the molecule. the positive charge has an
asymmetric distribution focused most strongly (blue) near the
protonated nitrogen, positioned to the right in each illustration
of figure 1a.
figure 1b shows a side view of a portion of the putative
local anesthetic binding site in a model of the voltage-gated
skeletal muscle sodium channel rnav1.4 adapted from lipkind and fozzard.8 the pore helices and extracellular pore
loops of domains d2 to d4 and the opposing transmembrane
s6 segments of domains d2 (silver) and d4 (orange) are
shown in an open-channel conformation. note the proximity
of the residues phe1579 and tyr1586 to each other and to the
selectivity filter above them. figure 1b is intended to represent a side view of the aqueous vestibule in which lidocaine
binds and to illustrate that lidocaine is large enough (⬇11⫻6

permeation pathway.
although standard point mutants of phe1579 typically alter
the biophysical properties of the channel,1,13,15 the unnatural
mutants we generated by in vivo nonsense suppression
resulted in channels that were indistinguishable from wildtype rnav1.4 with respect to kinetics of activation and
inactivation. figure 2a shows families of normalized sodium
currents from oocytes expressing wild-type rnav1.4 or channels with the indicated amino acid at position 1579. inward
currents shown in figure 2a were elicited in increments of
5-mv depolarizations from ⫺30 mv to ⫹10 mv from a
holding potential of ⫺100 mv. figure 2a, lower right, shows
that oocytes coinjected with 1579tag crna and a trna
lacking an appended amino acid did not generate measurable
sodium currents, ruling out counterfeit channel expression
attributable to enzymatic manipulation of the coinjected
trna within the oocyte. insets in figure 2a show the
consequences of trifluorination on the electrostatic potential
of benzene, where red and blue represent negative and
positive, respectively, and green is neutral. peak conductance–voltage relationships for activation are shown in figure
2b for wild-type rnav1.4 or channels with the indicated

amino acids at the 1579 position. there was no change in
either voltage dependence or slope of activation for any of the
mutants (table i in the online data supplement at http://
circres.ahajournals.org). moreover, replacement of phe1579
with either serially fluorinated derivatives of phenylalanine or
nonaromatic cha resulted in insignificant effects on steadystate inactivation (figure 2c). we also incorporated the same
series of side chains at tyr1586, a site roughly 2 turns
downstream along the s6 ␣ helix. like the 1579 site, the
incorporation of unnatural amino acids was well tolerated,
producing channels with healthy expression and normal
gating (supplemental table i).
a phenomenological hallmark of local anesthetic action on
sodium channels is a hyperpolarizing shift of the steady-state
inactivation relationship.24,27 to test a possible role for
cation-␲ energetics at phe1579, we incubated oocytes expressing the indicated channel type for 5 minutes in
200 ␮mol/l lidocaine at ⫺100 mv and then measured
steady-state inactivation (figure 2d). consistent with previous studies, incubation with lidocaine caused an approximate
⫺7-mv shift for phe1579 channels,27,28 but this effect was
serially diminished with each added fluorine to a minimum of
⫺2.5 mv for either 3,4,5-f3-phe1579 or cha1579 (inset).

showed indistinguishable tonic inhibition. the results for all
the side chains introduced at the 1579 position are shown in
figure 3b and demonstrate that a cation-␲ interaction with
this residue is not a factor in the tonic inhibition by lidocaine.
we also investigated the role of tyr1586 in tonic inhibition
by lidocaine. consistent with a previous study,2 removal of
the hydroxyl group by mutation to phenylalanine alleviated
the tonic inhibition from 30⫾6% to 19⫾3%. figure 3c
shows that further manipulation of this side chain to withdraw
␲ electrons had no additional effect on the tonic inhibition.
these data show that although the hydroxyl group of tyr1586
plays a role in inhibition, lidocaine does not interact directly
with its aromatic face under resting conditions.

use dependence
use-dependent inhibition of sodium channels is manifest as
progressively reduced current with increased stimulation
frequency. although experiments using site-directed mutagenesis show that use-dependent block by local anesthetics
involves side chain contributions from residues in each of the
four sodium channel domains,1,29 –31 the presence of an
aromatic phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan at the position aligned with 1579 is required for use-dependent inhibi-

tion,2 suggesting that a cation-␲ interaction may play a
substantial role at the binding site. figure 4a shows representative sodium currents in response to 20-hz depolarizations to ⫺10 mv from a holding potential of ⫺100 mv in the
presence of 200 ␮mol/l lidocaine. in each example, the first
and 50th pulses are labeled. note that the first pulse represents a channel inhibited in its resting state. in the absence of
lidocaine, sodium currents are stable in response to 20-hz
stimulation with no run-down in amplitude (data not shown).
quite dramatically, trifluorination of phe1579 nearly abolishes the use-dependent inhibition by lidocaine (figure 4a
and 4b). similar results were obtained at a 10-fold lower
lidocaine concentration, at which tonic inhibition was negligible (supplemental figure i), eliminating a substantial role of
rapid open-channel block.
evidence of a cation-␲ interaction between phe1579 and
lidocaine in the inactivated state is presented in figure 4b, in
which monotonic relief of inhibition can be seen for each
added fluorine, with cha substitution producing almost complete relief. this effect is most apparent at high frequencies,
where inactivated states would be expected to dominate.
although use-dependent inhibition by lidocaine is an obvious
phenotype, it is an inherently complicated process, and as

such, the progressive current reduction seen in figure 4a and
4b is likely a combination of interaction of lidocaine with
both inactivated and open states. although acknowledging
this caveat, we calculated an operationally defined inhibitory
constant ki from the fraction of current remaining at the
completion of 50 pulses delivered at 20 hz in the presence of
200 ␮mol/l lidocaine. this apparent inhibitory constant was
used to calculate the loss in binding energy, resulting from the
serial fluorination of phenylalanine or outright replacement
by cha. the result of this analysis is shown in figure 4c. the
abscissa is derived from ab initio estimates of the energetic
effect of fluorination on the cation-␲ interaction between
benzene and a na⫹ ion.17 as predicted for a cation-␲
interaction, a stepwise reduction in electrostatic potential on
the face of the aromatic results in a monotonic reduction in
lidocaine inhibition.32 given the ambiguities presented by
both the charge asymmetry of lidocaine and the interpretations of use dependence protocols, the linear relationship
between our experimental results and the theoretical predictions for a canonical cation-␲ system is striking, confirming
such an interaction between phe1579 and lidocaine.
the results are remarkably different when the same series
of phenylalanine derivatives are substituted into the nearby
aromatic tyr1586 (figure 4d). the complete data set in
figure 4e lacks both the trend and the magnitude of effect
that was observed at phe1579. the inset of figure 4e shows
the disruptive consequence of exchanging of phenylalanine
for tyrosine, an effect greater than any further manipulation of
the phenylalanine side chain. figure 4e and 4f shows that,
contrary to the situation for phe1579 only ⬇11 å away,
perturbation of ␲ electrons at tyr1586 has little consequence

on use-dependent lidocaine inhibition, ruling out a cation-␲
interaction at this site.
we then tested whether lidocaine might interact with a
third d4/s6 aromatic residue, tyr1574 (figure 1b), positioned roughly 10 å upstream from phe1579 but predicted to
lie on the opposite face of the s6 helix. alanine substitution
at this site results in a modest loss of both resting and
use-dependent inhibition by etidocaine in  xxxg2022xxx ,1 suggesting
that it may play a subtle role in stabilizing the inhibitor in its
binding pocket. we incorporated a single unnatural amino
acid at this site, 3,4,5-f3-phe, because trifluorination effectively ablates the negative electrostatic potential of the face of
an aromatic ring.20,32 as for the other 2 sites we examined,
unnatural amino acid incorporation was well tolerated and
produced channels with robust expression and voltagedependent gating similar to that of wild-type rnav1.4 channels (data not shown). trifluorination at this site had no effect
on tonic (36⫾6% versus 39⫾8%) or use-dependent inhibition
(84⫾4% versus 74⫾3% at 20-hz stimulation; p⫽0.08) for
rnav1.4 and 3,4,5-f3-phe 1574 channels, respectively. therefore, only 1 of the 3 d4/s6 aromatic residues, phe1579,
shows a robust cation-␲ interaction with lidocaine.

recovery
another experimental manifestation of lidocaine action is the
emergence of a slow component in the recovery from fast
inactivation.28 in fact, use-dependent inhibition is largely a
consequence of slowed recovery from inactivation. in the
absence of lidocaine, all phe1579 mutants recover rapidly
from a 15-ms pulse to ⫺10 mv (figure 5a), but clear
differences arise in the presence of 200 ␮mol/l lidocaine

(figure 5b). for each variant of phe1579, the recovery time
course can be fit by a double-exponential relaxation. a
plausible explanation for this biophysical behavior is that the
fast and slow components represent unblocked and lidocaineengaged channels, respectively. figure 5c and 5d show that
whereas the fast and slow time constants from the biexponential fits are the same across all channel types, the fractional weight of the fast, unblocked component is serially
increased with fluorination and replacement by cha. therefore, fluorination appears to reduce the fraction of channels
that trap lidocaine when they inactivate, whereas the recovery
rate of the drug-modified channels is insensitive to the
unnatural mutations. these results, like those describing
use-dependent inhibition, demonstrate a cation-␲ interaction
between lidocaine and phe1579. by contrast, neither fluorination of phe1586 nor replacement with cha had a measurable effect on the recovery time course (data not shown),
consistent with the use-dependent inhibition experiments
summarized in figure 4f.

role of charge
to further test the role of electrostatics in the interaction
between a local anesthetic and phe1579, we examined 2
nontitratable, structurally similar derivatives of lidocaine, 1
neutral ( xxxd305xxx ) and the other permanently charged
(qx-314). both compounds are postulated to have overlapping binding sites with other local anesthetics and, more
importantly, to rely on the presence of an aromatic side chain
at phe1579.26,33  xxxd305xxx  does not cause use-dependent
inhibition in sodium channels.24,33 replacement of phe1579
by either 3,4,5-f3-phe1579 or cha1579, both of which
effectively abolish the negative electrostatic potential on the
aromatic face of phenylalanine, had no effect on tonic
inhibition by 1 mmol/l  xxxd305xxx  (fraction of inhibition was
0.49⫾0.02, 0.46⫾0.04, 0.44⫾0.02, respectively, for wildtype and the 2 unnatural mutants). if the binding site of
 xxxd305xxx  overlaps that of lidocaine, our data suggest that
the fundamental effect of these manipulations of the aromatic
ring of phe1579 involves electrostatics, leaving  xxxd305xxx 
inhibition unaffected.
the lack of an effect of 3,4,5-f3-phe1579 on tonic inhibition by lidocaine (figure 3) raises the possibility that lidocaine is deprotonated (uncharged) in its tonically inhibited
state. this possibility can be tested directly with permanently
charged qx-314 that causes both tonic block and usedependent inhibition.1,27,34 if the tonically blocked state
involves an intimate interaction between qx-314 and
phe1579, then it should be substantially affected by trifluorination of the aromatic side chain. qx-314 was injected
directly into voltage-clamped oocytes to yield an approximate
cytoplasmic concentration of 0.5 mmol/l. this concentration
produces dramatic resting-state and use-dependent (1 hz)
inhibition in wild-type channels, and only the use-dependent
component is ameliorated in the 3,4,5-f3-phe1579 mutant
(figure 6a), similar to our results with lidocaine. the time
course of use dependence and the extent of block for the 2
oocytes shown in figure 6a are plotted in figure 6c. the
summarized data in figure 6e and 6f show that trifluorinating phe1579 has a similar effect on binding energy for

lidocaine and qx-314, suggesting comparable modes of
inhibition. the faster rate of use-dependent inhibition in the
unnatural mutant suggests an increased dissociation rate for
qx-314 in the drug-bound inactivated state. our results
further show that the tonically blocked state does not involve
a close interaction between the blocker and phe1579, and yet
a substantial cation-␲ interaction underlies use-dependent
inhibition by qx-314.
by contrast with phe1579, trifluorination of phe1586
causes a mild (⬍0.5 kcal/mol) stabilization of qx-314 block
in both the tonic and stimulated states (figure 6d through
6f). the effect on stimulated-state inhibition is energetically
indistinguishable for lidocaine and qx-314 (figure 6f).

discussion
we investigated whether 3 d4/s6 aromatic residues contribute to local anesthetic block through the electrostatic attraction of their aromatic ␲ electrons. in contrast with previous
studies using traditional site-directed mutagenesis, incorporation of unnatural amino acids at each site resulted in
channels with normal gating, substantially simplifying the
interpretation of their role in pore block. a cation-␲ interaction with lidocaine during use-dependent inhibition was
observed for only 1 site, phe1579, whereas ablation of the
negative electrostatic potential on the face of either tyr1574
or tyr1586 had relatively little consequence. the roles of
these tyrosine residues in block cited by previous reports may
therefore be attributable to the fact that replacement with a
nonaromatic amino acid is a more drastic alteration of side
chain chemistry and often changes the biophysical properties
of the channel.1,13–15 fluorination of phenylalanine, by contrast, has no effect on channel gating at any of the 3 d4/s6
positions. although our results suggest that cationic blockers
have an electrostatic attraction for the ␲ electrons of residue
1579, it may be surprising that replacement of this aromatic
residue with negatively charged glutamate or aspartate obliterates use-dependent inhibition by lidocaine.10 a possible
explanation for these apparently contradictory observations is
that in an aqueous milieu an organic cation typically has a
higher affinity for an aromatic ring than an acidic residue.35
this is attributable to the substantial energetic penalty for
dehydrating the acidic residue.
our study provides several structural insights into the local
anesthetic binding site in the high-affinity state created by
high-frequency stimulation. the cation-␲ interaction at
phe1579 suggests that the positive charge of lidocaine,
concentrated in the vicinity of its titratable amine group, is
situated near the aromatic face of phe1579 in the inactivated
state. by contrast, tyr1574 and tyr1586 have neither
cation-␲ interactions nor ␲–␲ stacking36 interactions with
lidocaine, as either would be disrupted by fluorination of the
aromatic ring. furthermore, cha lacks the quadrupole moment of an aromatic, and therefore its substitution should
reduce any attraction with the aromatic moiety of lidocaine
through ␲–␲ stacking, ruling out this type of attraction
between the blocker and the tyrosine residues.
electrostatic manipulations of phe1579 affect usedependent but not tonic inhibition. this contrasts with the
interaction between the cationic sodium channel blocker

figure 6. use-dependent and tonic block by qx-314. a, control is a representative trace at ⫺10 mv (0.1 hz), after which 25 nl of
20 mmol/l qx-314 was injected to give an estimated final concentration of 0.5 mmol/l qx-314, assuming a 1-␮l volume for the
oocyte. the oocyte was held at ⫺100 mv for 5 minutes without depolarization to allow for diffusion, followed by one hundred 1-hz,
15-ms depolarizations, the first of which represents the tonic block. the right recording is from an oocyte expressing trifluorinated
phe1579. b, comparable experiments for residue phe1586. c and d, normalized peak currents from recordings in a and b. arrow indicates time of qx-314 injection. time break is 5 minutes. e and f, effect of trifluorination on both lidocaine and qx-314 – binding energy;

tetrodotoxin and an extracellular pore aromatic, tyr401 in
rnav1.4.19 in the case of tetrodotoxin, both the tonic and
use-dependent block are weakened identically with serial
fluorination, implying that a similar physical interaction is
present in both states. in the present study, our results suggest
that tonic and use-dependent block either represent differences in the lidocaine binding site or arise from differences in
the charged state of lidocaine (protonated versus deprotonated). the latter possibility is ruled out by our experiments
with the permanently charged qx-314 (figure 6). both tonic
and use-dependent block are observable with qx-314, but
trifluorination of phe1579 alleviates only use-dependent
block. the composite results show not only that tonic and
stimulated states represent distinct conformations but also
that in the tonic state, lidocaine is not close to any of the 3
aromatic residues we examined. although lack of a cation-␲

interaction does not rule out other energetic attractions (eg,
hydrophobic, charge transfer, or induced dipoles in the
aromatic), an intimate contact between an aromatic side chain
and a charged blocker would be expected to be affected by the
dramatic manipulations of electrostatic potential we introduced (changes of ⬎600 mv within 2 å of the aromatic
ring20).
what, then, accounts for the differences between tonic and
use-dependent inhibition? because the 2 inhibited states have
the same voltage dependence, equivalent to a blocker residing
70% of the way into the electric field from the cytoplasmic
side,37 we assume that lidocaine occupies a comparably deep
site within the pore in both states. a cation-␲ interaction only
appears between phe1579 and a charged blocker during
repeated depolarizations, indicating that stimulation moves
this side chain closer to the blocker. the electrostatic invis-

ibility of phe1579 in the tonic state suggests that its side chain
does not point into the aqueous cavity of the pore and that it
is unveiled, for example, by a rotation of the d4/s6 helix
during a conformational transition that accompanies inactivation.29,38 – 40 note that this mechanism contrasts with a
previous proposal in which the pore lining remains stationary
while the blocker moves.37 future experiments should resolve
the gating motions that underlie the exposure of a highaffinity receptor.
