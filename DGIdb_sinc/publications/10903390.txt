abstract: in the mid seventies a drug design programme using the amanita muscaria
constituent muscimol (7) as a lead structure, led to the design of  xxxd2248xxx  (23) and
(r)-nipecotic acid (24) as specific gaba uptake inhibitors and the isomeric
compounds isoguvacine (10) and isonipecotic acid (11) as specific gabaa receptor
agonists. the availability of these compounds made it possible to study the
pharmacology of the gaba uptake systems and the gabaa receptors separately.
based on extensive cellular and molecular pharmacological studies using 23, 24, and a number of monoand bicyclic analogues, it has been demonstrated that neuronal and glial gaba transport mechanisms
have dissimilar substrate specificities. with gaba transport mechanisms as pharmacological targets,
strategies for pharmacological interventions with the purpose of stimulating gaba neurotransmission
seem to be (1) effective blockade of neuronal as well as glial gaba uptake in order to enhance the
inhibitory effects of synaptically released gaba, or (2) selective blockade of glial gaba uptake in order
to increase the amount of gaba taken up into, and subsequently released from, nerve terminals. the
bicyclic compound (r)-n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (17) has recently been reported as the most selective glial
gaba uptake inhibitor so far known and may be a useful tool for further elucidation of the pharmacology
of gaba transporters. in recent years, a variety of lipophilic analogues of the amino acids 23 and 24
have been developed, and one of these compounds, tiagabine (49) containing (r)-nipecotic acid (24) as
the gaba transport carrier-recognizing structure element, is now marketed as an antiepileptic agent.

introduction
the amino acid  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), is
an inhibitory neurotransmitter concerned with the
control of neuronal activity in the mammalian
central nervous system (cns) [1–3]. there is
considerable direct and indirect evidence that
impaired operation of gaba-mediated inhibitory
synapses may be an important causative factor in
experimental and clinical seizure disorders [4–6].
involvement of gaba in human epilepsy is
supported by measurements of decreased activity of
the gaba-synthesizing enzyme  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase (gad) in brain biopsy material and
reduced gaba levels in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid
from patients suffering from different types of
epilepsy. reduced inhibitory control may underlie
paroxysmal and inappropriate discharges of
neurones in the cerebral and hippocampal cortices,
and such a proposal clearly focuses attention on the

various processes associated with gaba-mediated
neurotransmission as potential targets for clinically
useful anticonvulsants.
the synaptic release of gaba could in
principle be enhanced by selectively augmenting the
synthesis of this amino acid, even though levels of
gad within the synaptic terminals appear to be
lower than normal at epileptic foci. a more direct,
but perhaps less suitable [7–10], approach will be
the use of potent and specific gaba agonists, of
which many are available [11–14], to activate
postsynaptic gaba receptors, the sensitivity of
which may have been altered by partial or complete
denervation. the most flexible approach to
stimulating gaba-mediated neurotransmission
may be facilitation of the effect of synaptically
released gaba, either by modifying the sensitivity
of modulatory sites (barbiturates, benzodiazepines)
[15, 16] or by interfering with the inactivation of
gaba [10, 17]. although the number of gaba
axon terminals and, consequently, the density of
neuronal transport processes [18] seem to be
reduced at epileptic foci in animals, the
characteristics of the remaining transport systems

may be unchanged. thus, neuronal gaba uptake
mechanisms in brain tissue from seizure-susceptible
mice were not significantly different from those in
age-matched control animals [19].

the amount of gaba taken up by the neuronal
carrier with subsequent elevation of the gaba
concentration in nerve terminals.

since the discovery of high-affinity gaba
uptake systems in brain tissue preparations [20, 21],
the physiological role of these membrane processes
has been the subject of extensive studies. it is now
generally accepted that these mechanisms are
concerned with the removal of synaptically released
gaba as part of the termination of the gaba
neurotransmission process, but the precise
mechanism of action, including the time course and
capacity, of these mechanisms in vivo are far from
being fully understood [2, 22]. the involvement of
neuronal as well as glial cells in high-affinity
gaba uptake has been confirmed and further
elucidated in numerous studies using cell culture
methods [23, 24].

heterogeneity
transporters

the mapping of the gaba transport systems in
the cns and the elucidation of their biochemical
and pharmacological characteristics is obviously
incomplete, making studies of their physiological
role complicated. on the basis of the available
knowledge of the kinetics of gaba transport
systems and of the receptor-mediated gaba
neurotransmission process, it has been suggested
that carrier-mediated transport is unlikely to be the
primary event in the termination of the synaptic
actions of gaba [25]. it has been proposed that
diffusion of gaba into the postsynaptic neurone
constitutes a highly efficient mechanism for
removing gaba from the synaptic cleft and from
the environment of postsynaptic receptors [25].
gaba may subsequently be transferred to nerve
terminals and/or glial cells by as yet unknown
mechanisms.
in light of the limited knowledge of the
processes underlying the termination of the synaptic
action of gaba, at the present time it is not
possible to single out with certainty the transport
mechanism most susceptible to pharmacological
intervention. it has, however, been established that
neuronal and glial gaba uptake mechanisms have
dissimilar substrate specificities, which in turn are
distinctly different from those of postsynaptic
gaba receptors, making selective pharmacological
studies on gaba uptake possible. the most logical
and realistic strategies for such pharmacological
interventions with the purpose of stimulating gaba
neurotransmission seem to be: (1) effective
blockade of both neuronal and glial gaba uptake
in order to enhance the inhibitory effects of
synaptically released gaba, or (2) selective
blockade of glial gaba uptake in order to increase

gaba

molecular cloning studies have disclosed that,
like virtually all other biomechanisms, gaba
transporters are heterogeneous [22]. although the
individual gaba transporters have been given
different acronyms by the research groups which
have been involved in the molecular cloning studies,
rat gaba transporters are now most commonly
named rgat-1, rgat-2, rgat-3, and rbgt-1, the
last being capable of transporting gaba as well as
the osmolyte betaine [26–30]. species differences
have been observed, and since homologues
transporters identified in different animals have
sometimes been given different acronyms, the
literature should be read cautiously. thus, whereas
human gaba transporters are named hgat-1,
hgat-2, hgat-3, and  xxxg2103xxx -1, respectively [31],
mouse  xxxg2143xxx  is the homologue of rgat1, mouse
gat2 is the homologue of rbgt1, mouse gat3 is
the homologue of rgat-2, and mouse  xxxg2144xxx  is the
homologue of rgat-3 [32]. a taurine transporter
(taut) has also been cloned from rat brain [33].
this transporter, which is sensitive to inhibition by
ß-alanine (1), transports gaba with low affinity
and thus should be considered a potential functional
gaba transporter in the cns.
in light of the previously described dissimilar
pharmacological characteristics of neuronal and
glial gaba transport systems [12, 13, 34], the
neuronal versus glial localizations of gaba
transporter mrnas have been studied [32].
whereas  xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg2144xxx , and  xxxg2145xxx  mrnas were
detected in both neurones and glial cells,  xxxg2146xxx  is
the only gaba transporter being selectively
expressed in nonneuronal cells, and  xxxg2145xxx  was
shown to be the only high-affinity gaba
transporter mrna present in type 1 astrocytes. it
has been proposed that the dissimilar
pharmacological data obtained using cultured
neurones and glial cells may reflect the presence of
various combinations of the cloned gaba and
taurine transporters [32].
gaba analogues as gaba transport inhibitors: stereostruc-ture
– activity relationships
a large number of acyclic and cyclic gaba
analogues have been studied as inhibitors of
neuronal and glial gaba transport [10, 12]. (s)-

gaba uptake inhibitors.

2,4-diaminobutyric acid [(s)-daba, 2] and ßalanine (1) (fig. 1) have been used as markers for
neuronal and glial gaba transporters, respectively
[20, 35]. the lack of specificity of 2 as a substrate
for neuronal gaba transport [36, 37], and the
observation that 1 appears to be transported with
equal efficiency by neuronal and glial uptake
mechanisms, in both cases without using gaba
transport carriers [38], have markedly reduced the
value of these amino acids as marker substrates.
like 2, cis-3-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (3achc), the active enantiomer being (1s,3r)-3achc (4) [39], was considered to be a selective
substrate for neuronal gaba transport
mechanism(s) [40, 41], but 4 actually interacts with
glial as well as neuronal gaba transport [37, 42].

provided a chiral gaba analogue showing a
different enantiopharmacological profile. thus,
whereas (r)-homo-ß-proline (5) enantioselectively
binds to gabaa receptors, 5 and the corresponding
(s)-isomer (6) are equipotent as inhibitors of
gaba uptake [45]. these structure-activity studies
seem to indicate a complex relationship between
absolute stereochemistry, conformational mobility
and affinity for synaptic gaba recognition sites
[34].

muscimol (7), a constituent of the mushroom
amanita muscaria, is a very potent gabaa agonist,
but 7 also is an inhibitor of neuronal and glial
gaba uptake and a substrate for the gabametabolizing enzyme  xxxg8xxx  [46–48].
thiomuscimol (8) shows a pharmacological profile
similar to that of 7 [46]. systematic variation of the
structures of 7 and 8, notably transformation of
these 3-isoxazolol and 3-isothiazolol bioisosteres of
gaba into bicyclic analogues in order to separate
the multiple affinities of these compounds, has
provided a number of specific gabaa receptor
agonists and gaba uptake inhibitors (fig. 2). an
important step in this drug design programme was
the synthesis of the enantiomers of 4,5-

whereas the (s)-form of the conformationally
restrained gaba analogue, trans-4-aminopent-2enoic acid (4-me-taca) is a specific gabaa
agonist, (r)-4-me-taca (3) is a gaba transport
inhibitor showing no detectable gaba receptor
affinity, but 3 is only slightly more potent as an
inhibitor of neuronal gaba transport than as an
inhibitor of gaba uptake into glial cells [43]. in
light of the distinct enantiopharmacological profile
of 4-me-taca, in which the bond corresponding
to c2-c3 of the molecule of gaba is
conformationally immobilized, it was surprising to
observe that incorporation of c3-c4 into a
pyrrolidine ring to give homo-ß-proline [44],

6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-3-ol ( xxxg2282xxx ,
19), 14 being a potent and specific gabaa agonist
[46, 50] and 19 a specific gaba uptake inhibitor
[51] showing some selectivity for the glial transport
system [52]. the 3-isothiazolol thip analogue,
thio-thip (15), on the other hand, is a weak
gabaa agonist at spinal gabaa receptors [53]
but an antagonist at brain gabaa receptors [54].
the 7-membered ring analogue of thip, thia

affinity [47, 55]. conversion of 14 and 15 into the

comparable affinity and relative efficacy [56, 57].
isoguvacine (10) and its saturated analogue
isonipecotic acid (11), which are the monocyclic
analogues of 14, are equally specific and even more
potent than 14 as gabaa agonists [46, 50]. thip
(14), isoguvacine (10), and isonipecotic acid (11)
are now the standard full gabaa agonists (fig. 2).

(rs)-3-hydroxy-4-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,2benzisoxazole (exo- xxxg2282xxx ) and the corresponding
n-methyl analogue, n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx . the gaba
uptake affinities of these compounds reside in the
(r)-enantiomers, and whereas (r)-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (18)
is comparable with 19 in terms of potency and gliaselectivity, (r)-n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (17) is more
potent and shows a markedly higher degree of gliaselectivity as compared to 18 and 19 [58], making
17 an important new lead structure in this drug
design programme (fig. 2).

whereas thio- xxxg2282xxx  (20) is markedly weaker
than  xxxg2282xxx  (19) as an inhibitor of gaba uptake
[53], the 7-membered ring analogue, 5,6,7,8tetrahydro-4h-isoxazolo[4,5-c]azepin-3-ol (thao,
21) is only slightly weaker than 19 [55]. one of the
goals of this drug design programme is the
development of glia-selective gaba uptake
inhibitors, and we recently reported the synthesis of

these gaba uptake inhibitors, notably  xxxd2248xxx 
(23) and (r)-nipecotic acid (24) have been
extensively used for studies of the physiological
role of the gaba transport systems [10]. thus, the
depressant action of microelectrophoretically
applied gaba on single neurones in different parts
of the cat cns was markedly enhanced by
simultaneous application of 23 or 24, supporting the

and 11, the cyclic amino acids  xxxd2248xxx  (23) and
(r)-nipecotic acid (24) derived from  xxxg2282xxx  (19)
were specific gaba uptake inhibitors [51, 59, 60]
though much more potent than 19, but showing
approximately equal affinity for neuronal and glial
gaba transporters [43]. racemic cis-4hydroxynipecotic acid [rel-(3s,4r)-4-oh-nipecotic
acid, 25] shows a pharmacological profile very
similar to those of 23 and 24 [10].

view that the gaba transport systems are
responsible for the removal of synaptically released
gaba from the synaptic cleft. although  xxxg2282xxx 
(19) and, in particular, thio- xxxg2282xxx  (20) are only
weak inhibitors of gaba uptake, these compounds
have significant enhancing effects on the depressant
action of gaba on cat spinal neurones (fig. 3)
[53].
muscimol (7) (fig. 2) is a 3-isoxazolol
bioisostere of gaba (fig. 1), and, as mentioned
above, this bioisosteric relationship was utilized to
design the very potent gaba uptake inhibitors
 xxxd2248xxx  (23) and (r)-nipecotic acid (24). thus, the
gaba uptake affinity of 7 was “isolated” in the
conformationally restricted analogue  xxxg2282xxx  (19)
and subsequently optimized by conversion of 19
into the amino carboxylic acids 23 and 24 (fig. 4).
these achievements prompted the synthesis and
pharmacological characterization of the monocyclic
amino acid analogues of thao (21),
homoguvacine (26) and homonipecotic acid (27)
[61] (fig. 4). although 21 is slightly weaker than

hn

 xxxg2282xxx  (19) as an inhibitor of gaba uptake [55], it
was surprising to observe that 26 as well as 27 were
very weak inhibitors not only of gaba receptor
binding but also of neuronal as well as glial gaba
uptake [52, 62] (fig. 4). furthermore, neither
geometrical isomer of the amino acid analogue of
exo- xxxg2282xxx , 2-aminocyclohexanecar-boxylic acid
(2-achc), shows significant effect on gaba
uptake. thus, although (r)-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (18) is
equipotent with  xxxg2282xxx  (19) as a gaba uptake
inhibitor, rel-(1s,2r)-2-achc (28) and rel(1r,2r)-2-achc (29) are very weak inhibitors of
gaba uptake [63] (fig. 4).
these structure-activity relationships for the
compounds depicted in fig. 4 illustrate that even
within the same biological system and within a class
of structurally related compounds, predictions of the
pharmacological consequences of bioisosteric
replacements of functional groups should be made
with great care.

gaba uptake inhibitors.

x-ray crystallographic and 1h nmr spectroscopic
analyses, (r)-nipecotic acid (24) [64] and (3s,4r)4-oh-nipecotic acid (25) [65] adopt chair
conformations with the carboxylate groups in
predominantly equatorial orientations. the depicted
conformation of  xxxg2282xxx  (19) is derived from an xray crystallographic analysis of its o-methyl
derivative, 3-methoxy-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo
[4,5-c]pyridine hydrochloride [66].  xxxg2282xxx  (19) is
much weaker than 24 and 25 as a gaba uptake
inhibitor, but these three compounds all show low
degrees of selectivity for glial or neuronal gaba
uptake systems. the similarity of the conformation
of the semirigid  xxxd774xxx  with those of 24 and
25 may indicate that these compounds interact with
the gaba transport carriers in conformations
similar to those illustrated in fig. 5. the low-energy
conformation of (r)-n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (17), which
is based on an x-ray crystallographic analysis of its
hydrobromide salt [58], obviously is different from
those of 19, 24, and 25. since 17 shows a 13-fold
selectivity as an inhibitor of glial versus neuronal

gaba uptake [58], this particular conformation of
17 may be an important structural determinant for
glia-selective gaba uptake inhibitors. interestingly
removal of the methyl group of 17, to give 18, or
replacement of this group by larger groups lead to
pronounced loss of gaba transport affinity [58].
gaba uptake inhibitors and the
blood-brain barrier: a prodrug
approach
the zwitterionic structure of amino acids
normally makes penetration of the lipophilic bloodbrain barrier (bbb) by such compounds difficult.
all of the compounds depicted in figs. 1, 2, and 4
have zwitterionic structures, and, consequently, the
bbb quite effectively prevents most of these
compounds from entering the brain after peripheral
administration in animals. however, very small
fractions of neutral amino acids actually do exist as
unionized molecules in aqueous solution. the ratios

determined by x-ray crystallographic analyses. the depicted structure of cationic 19 is derived from the structure of 3-methoxy4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridine hydrochloride (o-me- xxxg2282xxx  hydrochloride) determined by an x-ray crystallographic
analysis [66]. the illustrated structure of cationic 17 is based on an x-ray crystallographic analysis of the hydrobromide salt of
17 [58].

between the concentration of ionized (zwitterionic)
and unionized amino acid molecules (i/u ratios) are
determined by the protolytic properties (pka values)
of the compounds, large differences between the
two pka values giving high values for the i/u ratios
[53, 67]. since amino acids are likely to penetrate
the bbb in the unionized form, compounds with a
high i/u ratio are normally unable to enter the brain
after systemic administration, provided that the
amino acids are not substrates for carrier
mechanisms in the bbb. from a pharmacological
point of view, it is, therefore, of interest to develop
analogues of centrally active amino acids with pka
values, which differ less than those of the parent
compounds. since there is no evidence to suggest
that the specific gabaa agonist thip (14) (fig. 2)
is a substrate for a bbb carrier mechanism, the
importance of the i/u ratio is emphasized by the
observation that 14 (pka 4.4, 8.5; i/u 1000) very
easily penetrates the bbb in animals and man after
systemic administration [11, 13].
gaba (pka 4.0, 10.7; i/u 800,000) does not
penetrate the bbb to a significant extent, and

pharmacological effects following intraperitoneal
administration in mice [59, 68].
the prodrug approach has, therefore, been used
to study the pharmacological effects of these and
related gaba uptake inhibitors in animals [68–70].
an ideal prodrug is a derivative of a centrally active
compound without pharmacological effects per se,
which is converted into the parent compound in the
brain tissue without formation of by-products
showing undesired effects. the compounds shown
in fig. 6 exemplify bioreversible derivatives of 23,
(rs)-24, and 25. furthermore, the o-pivaloyloxymethyl derivatives of the enantiomers of n-meexo- xxxg2282xxx  (fig. 2), compounds 34 and 35, are
shown.

[68, 69] and of the double ester of 25,  xxxd3171xxx

prodrugs [10]. the pivaloyloxymethyl esters of
(rs)-24, (31), and  xxxd2248xxx , (32), have also been
administered systemically in mice, and the
anticonvulsant effects of these compounds were not
accompanied by cholinergic side effects [70].

gaba uptake inhibitors.

anticonvulsant drugs, the relatively high doses of
these two prodrugs required for effective
suppression of seizures in animals probably prevent
their use in the human clinic.
since the glia-selective gaba uptake inhibitor
(r)-n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (17) is not active in mice after
systemic administration, the prodrug approach was
used to study the in vivo pharmacology of this
compound [58]. compounds 34 and 35 were
shown to be bioreversible derivatives of the
respective enantiomers of n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (fig.
2). whereas the (r)-enantiomer 34 showed potent
anticonvulsant effects
after
subcutaneous
administration in mice, the (s)-enantiomer 35 was
inactive,in agreement with the observation that 17
and not the (s)-enantiomer is the active gaba
uptake inhibitor. the doses of 34 required for
effective protection of the animals against
convulsions actually were lower than those reported
for 31 [68], although (rs)-24 is more potent than
17 as an inhibitor of gaba uptake [58]. these
relative potencies of (rs)-24 and 17 in vitro
compared with the relative potencies of the
respective prodrugs 31 and 34 as anticonvulsants in
vivo may reflect that selective inhibitors of glial
gaba uptake have interest as therapeutic
anticonvulsant drugs.
gaba uptake inhibitors containing
4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl
and
related n-substituents
introduction of small substituents on the
secondary amino groups of  xxxd2248xxx  (23), (r)nipecotic acid (24), or (rs)-24 leads to compounds
with decreased affinity for the gaba transport
carriers [10]. quite surprisingly, substitution of the
bulky 4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl (dpb) group for the
hydrogen atom of the amino group of (rs)-24 to
give n-dpb-nipecotic acid (skf-89976-a, 36)
(fig. 7) provided a gaba uptake inhibitor
markedly more potent than (rs)-24 itself [71].
similarly, dpb- xxxd2248xxx  (42) [71] and dpbthpo (43) [72, 73] were shown to be at least an
order of magnitude more potent than the parent
gaba uptake inhibitors, 23 and 19, respectively
(fig. 2). although 19 and thao (21) are
approximately equipotent as inhibitors of glial and
also of neuronal gaba uptake, both compounds
being twice as potent at the glial uptake system, it is
noteworthy that dpb-thao (44) (fig. 7) is much
more potent than dpb- xxxg2282xxx  (43) as an inhibitor
of glial as well as neuronal gaba uptake [73]. in
light of these remarkable structure-activity
relationships it was, on the other hand, surprising

current pharmaceutical design, 2000, vol. 6, no. 12

1201

that the n-dpb-analogues of gaba, compound 37,
and of racemic 3-achc [(rs)-4], compound 39,
were shown to be weaker than their parent amino
acids as gaba uptake inhibitors [71]. these
unexpected structure-activity relationships may
reflect that the dpb-analogues 37 and 39 contain
secondary amino groups, whereas the potent
inhibitors 36, 42, and 43 contain tertiary amino
groups. this proposal is supported by the
observation that n-methylation of 37 to give 38
provides a substantially more potent gaba uptake
inhibitor [74]. whereas saturation of the double
bond of 36 to give 40 is accompanied by virtual loss
of activity, replacement of the double bond of 36 by
an ether function to give 41 has limited
pharmacological consequences, 41 being only
slightly weaker than 36 as a gaba uptake inhibitor
[75].
the molecular mechanisms underlying these
striking structure-activity relationships are
enigmatic, although extensive studies have shown
that the amino acid heads of these compounds, with
a few possible exceptions, are recognized and
bound by the transporter [10, 71]. however,
whereas the underivatized monocyclic amino acid,
including (r)-nipecotic acid (24) [10, 76] are acting
as substrates/inhibitors, the dpb-analogue skf89976-a (36) has been shown not to be a substrate
for the gaba transport carrier [77].
molecular pharmacology
whereas gaba shows high or moderately high
affinity for hgat-1, rgat-1, rgat-2, hgat-3,
rgat-3, as well as  xxxg2103xxx -1,  xxxd2248xxx  (23) and (r)nipecotic acid (24) show high affinity for hgat-1,
rgat-1, and rgat-2, rather low affinity for hgat3 and rgat-3, and very low affinity for  xxxg2103xxx -1
[78]. the dpb-analogues and related lipophilic
compounds, so far studied, including skf-89976-a
(36) (fig. 7), ci-966 (48), and tiagabine (49) (fig.
8) show a very different affinity profile.
interestingly, these compounds interact selectively
with hgat-1 and rgat-1, showing the highest
affinity for hgat-1 [78]. similar relative gaba
transport affinities were demonstrated for the
structurally related compound nnc-711 (44),
containing an oxime group [78] (fig. 7).
very different affinity profiles were
demonstrated for the more recently synthesized
analogues, (s)-snap 5114 (46) and snap 5294
(47) [31, 32]. compound 46 binds with some
selectivity to hgat-3 and shows decreasing affinity
for rgat-2,  xxxg2103xxx -1, and hgat-1 [31]. snap

5294 (47), on the other hand, preferentially binds to
rgat-2 and shows lower affinity for hgat-1,
hgat-3, and  xxxg2103xxx -1 [31]. compound 47 was

synthesized and tested as the racemate, but the
pharmacology of both of the enantiomers of snap
5114 (fig. 7) has been reported [31]. whereas the

gaba uptake inhibitors.

affinity for gaba transporters of tiagabine (49)
and all other lipophilic analogues of nipecotic acid,
so far reported [31, 79–81] resides in the (r)enantiomers, the (s)-form of snap 5114 (46) is the
more potent enantiomer [31]. (r)-snap 5114 is
much weaker than 46 at all of the four cloned
gaba transporters, and the degree of selectivity of
(r)-snap 5114 for hgat-3 is markedly lower
than that reported for (s)-snap 5114 (46) [31].
these stereostructure-activity relationships may
reflect quite different structures of the recognition
sites of  xxxg2143xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx  and/or dissimilar
molecular mechanisms for interaction of 46 and, for
example, tiagabine (49) with the transporter
recognition sites.
the lipophilic (r)-nipecotic acid analogues,
including tiagabine (49) are typically at least four
orders of magnitude more potent at  xxxg2143xxx  than at
any of the other cloned gaba transporters [31].

1203

interestingly, this degree of selectivity is reduced for
dpb- xxxg2282xxx  (43) containing the 3-isoxazolol
carboxyl group bioisostere, 43 being only 7 times
more potent at mouse  xxxg2143xxx  than at mouse gat2
[73]. in nnc 05-2090 (55) the lipophilic group as
well as the “polar head” of the molecule have been
extensively modified, the 4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4piperidinol structure element being structurally
unrelated to nipecotic acid or  xxxg2282xxx  (fig. 7), and
55 shows a unique pharmacological profile at the
gaba transporters [82]. compound 55 was shown
to be a selective and moderately potent inhibitor of
mouse gat2, which corresponds to  xxxg2103xxx -1. nnc
05-2090 (55) actually is approximately 1000 fold
more potent than (r)-nipecotic acid (24) as an
inhibitor of mouse gat2, and may be a useful tool
for studies of the physiological role and
pharmacological importance of  xxxg2103xxx -1 (mouse
gat2).

behavioural
pharmacology

and

clinical

the lipophilic analogues of the racemic or the
(r)-form (24) of nipecotic acid,  xxxd2248xxx  (23), and
 xxxg2282xxx  (19) (fig. 2), which are depicted in figs. 7
and 8, are capable of penetrating the bbb, and some
of these compounds have been subjected to
extensive animal behavioural studies primarily as
anticonvulsant agents. soon after the discovery of
skf-89976-a (36) [71], this compound was shown
to effectively protect animals against seizures [71,
83, 84], and these anticonvulsant effects were only
to a limited extent accompanied by the general cns
depressant effects normally observed for traditional
anticonvulsant drugs [85].
these observations prompted extensive drug
discovery activities in the gaba uptake inhibitor
field and led to the development of a large number
of compounds containing nipecotic acid,  xxxd2248xxx 
(23), or analogues as gaba transporterrecognizing heads and appropriate aromatic
lipophilic n-substituents as potency enhancing and
bbb penetration facilitating groups [74, 75, 86–92].
one of these compounds, ci-966 (48) (fig. 8), was
shown to be systemically active in a number of
animal models predictive for anticonvulsantactivity
[93, 94] and was subsequently investigated in a
phase i clinical trial [93, 95]. at relatively high
doses, compound 48 did, however, provoke side
effects such as myoclonus and a catatonic-likestate.
administration of gaba uptake inhibitors is likely
to enhance gabaa as well as  xxxg828xxx 
mediated transmission, and whereas the former side
effect of 48 is likely a result of overactivation of
gabaa receptors, the catatonic-like symptoms may
be mediated by gabab receptors [93]. it has been
proposed that the elevated gabaergic tone
produced by gaba uptake inhibitors throughout
the cns selectively enhances the action of gaba
at gabaa receptors [96]. although this side effect
profile of 48 administered to man probably reflects
that this compound was given at doses higher than
those required for seizure control, ci-966 (48) was
not subjected to further studies in the human clinic.
as a result of extensive structure-activity studies
on analogues of skf-89976-a (36) and ci-966
(48), tiagabine (49) emerged as a very potent gaba
uptake inhibitor [97–100] showing a remarkable
selectivity for the hgat-1 subtype of gaba
transporters [78]. tiagabine was subjected to
extensive animal behavioural pharmacological
studies [101–103], and clinical investigations have
been completed with proven anticonvulsant and
antiepileptic efficacy of 49 in man [104, 105].

krogsgaard-larsen et al.

tiagabine is now marketed as an add-on therapeutic
agent for the treatment of epilepsy. thus, from the
discovery of nipecotic acid as a specific inhibitor of
gaba uptake (fig. 2) [51], it took approximately
two decades to develop this compound into a
marketed antiepileptic agent [101–105].
in continuation of this drug development project,
there has been a continuous search for new gaba
uptake inhibitors with improved pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic properties, as potential nextgeneration drugs. in one line of research, the chain
connecting the gaba transporter-recognizing
amino acid head and the diaryl moiety of skf89976-a (36) has been quite extensively modified
as exemplified by compounds 40, 41, 45 (fig. 7)
and 50–52 (fig. 8) [74, 75, 79–81]. whereas 40 is
essentially inactive, 41 and 45 show inhibitory
effects on gaba uptake comparable with that of
36. more recently it has been shown that
compounds 50 and 51 are inactive or relatively
weak, respectively, as gaba uptake inhibitors [80].
in contrast, the oxa-analogue 52 of compound 51 is
equipotent with tiagabine (49) as an inhibitor of
gaba uptake and as an anticonvulsant agent in
mice [80]. from these studies, it can be concluded
that the presence of an appropriately located
heteroatom, which normally is oxygen, in the chain
of these compounds has a pronounced enhancing
effect on the potency of the compounds in vitro and
in vivo. these observations illustrate effective use of
the so-called “electronegative principle” in drug
design [81].
another line of structure-activity studies has
focused on the lipophilic aromatic structure element
of this class of gaba uptake inhibitors. as part of
these studies, the diaryl units of, for example, 36
and 49 have been replaced by tricyclic structures as
exemplified by compounds 53 and 54, and actually
also by the, otherwise structurally unrelated,
compound 55 [82] discussed previously (fig. 8).
generally, transformation of the diaryl moieties into
tricyclic structure elements results in compounds
with reduced affinity for the gaba transporters,
although the gaba uptake affinity and
anticonvulsant activity is strongly dependent on the
geometry of the tricyclic unit. thus, whereas
compound 53 is essentially inactive as a gaba
uptake inhibitor, 54 shows a gaba uptake affinity
higher than that of skf-89976-a (36) [81]. based
on a structure-activity analysis of a comprehensive
series of compounds, it is concluded that when the
two aryl groups are part of a planar ring system, the
compounds are essentially inactive as inhibitors of
gaba uptake. a certain degree of out-of-plane
geometry of the two aryl groups is of critical

gaba uptake inhibitors.

radiolabeled forms of a number of gaba

as well as glial [106] gaba transport carriers.

neurones and astrocytes but not to be a substrate for
the gaba transport carriers in these cell systems
[77]. [125i]cipca (57) has been synthesized for
brain distribution studies and may be an important
radiotracer for studies of the gaba transport

systems [107]. gaba uptake inhibitors may be
useful tools for in vivo studies of central gaba
neurotransmission in animals and man using
positron emission tomography (pet) techniques.
these prospects have prompted the synthesis of
11c-labeled 38 [108] and the gaba uptake
inhibitor 58 labeled with 18f [109] (fig. 9) as
potential pet ligands.

gaba transporters and being capable of
penetrating the bbb, as exemplified by skf89976-a (36) and ci-966 (48). tiagabine (49),
which is a member of this large group of
compounds, has been developed and marketed as a
therapeutic agent for the treatment of epilepsy.
very recently, (r)-n-me-exo- xxxg2282xxx  (17) was
designed as a gaba uptake inhibitor showing the
highest degree of selectivity for the glial gaba
transport system so far observed. although 17 does
not penetrate the bbb, prodrugs of 17, such as 34,
show potent anticonvulsant effect after systemic
administration in mice, emphasizing the importance
of the glial gaba uptake system as a
pharmacological and, perhaps, therapeutic target in
convulsive conditions and disorders. a drug design
project using 17 as a lead may provide a new class
of gaba uptake inhibitors with a novel mechanism
of action and pharmacological effects of therapeutic
interest.
the molecular mechanism of action of the
lipophilic analogues of  xxxd2248xxx  (23) or (r)nipecotic acid (24), such as ci-966 (48) and
tiagabine (49), respectively, is unknown. in contrast
to the n-unsubstituted amino acids, these analogues
do not seem to be substrates for the gaba
transporters, although the competitive nature of the
inhibitory effects strongly suggests that they do
interact directly with the carrier binding site. using
x-ray crystallographic techniques, it may be
possible to study the interaction between these
gaba uptake inhibitors and recombinant gaba
transporters, or the binding domain(s) of these
biomolecules, in the future. information of this kind
would be of major scientific interest and importance
for future drug design approaches in this field.
