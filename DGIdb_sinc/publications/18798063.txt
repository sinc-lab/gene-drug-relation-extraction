abstract
tas-102 is a novel formulation of the fluorinated pyrimidine analogue  xxxd3434xxx 
(ftd) with an inhibitor of  xxxg2365xxx . the purpose of this study was to determine the mtd and dlt for tas-102 administered three times a day on days 1–5 and 8–12 every
4 weeks. fifteen patients were enrolled with two patients experiencing dose-limiting fatigue and
granulocytopenia at the first dose level (80 mg/m2/day). granulocytopenia was the primary toxicity: 7 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia with the first course. no responses
were noted, but nine patients demonstrated prolonged stable disease in this heavily pretreated
5-fu refractory population.

introduction
tas-102 is a novel combination of the oral thymidine analogue ftd and a  xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor (tpi), 5-chloro-6-(2-iminopyrrolidin-1-yl) methyl2,4(1h ,3h )- xxxd3470xxx  hydrochloride, at a molar ratio
of 1:0.5.  xxxg2365xxx  (tp) is the enzyme responsible for the degradation of ftd into its inactive form,
5-trifluromethyl-2 -deoxyuridine. inhibition of tp results in
both a three-fold increase in ftd serum concentrations and
a direct antiangiogenic effect. tp, also called platelet-derived
 xxxg786xxx , is upregulated in colorectal cancer, and this increased expression has been corre-

lated with increased microvascular density, development of
metastasis, and diminished survival (1–3). treatment with
tpi completely inhibited tp activity and reduced the formation of metastases in a xenograft model of human colon
cancer (4).
ftd’s mechanism of action involves both the inhibition of
thymidine synthase, as seen with 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), and the
creation of single-strand dna breaks due to the incorporation
of the triphosphate form of ftd into dna. ftd’s ability to
be incorporated into dna and tpi’s anti-angiogenic properties
may explain the marked activity of tas-102 in 5-fu-refractory
colon cancer cell lines and xenograft models (5, 6).
the initial studies evaluating the anticancer activity of ftd
were conducted in the 1960s, but further development of this
agent was not undertaken because if its short half life (12-18
minutes) and pronounced hematologic toxicity (7, 8). the initial phase i/ii studies evaluated a variety of ftd schedules in
chemotherapy naı̈ve metastatic breast cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer (7). in the initial cohort of 11 patients treated with
once-daily doses of ftd, no responses were seen, but in a second cohort exploring multiple daily doses of ftd, the response
rate was 28%. in support of this clinically observed schedule dependence of ftd, recent preclinical studies of ftd in xenograft

models have shown increased dna fragmentation and improved
antitumor activity when the agent is administered in a multiple
daily-dose formulation (9). this time-dependent effect could not
be replicated by administering higher ftd doses once daily.
the initial clinical investigations evaluating tas-102 have
focused upon various once-daily dosing schedules and have
enrolled a total of 77 patients (10-12). granulocytopenia was
consistently identified as the dose-limiting toxicity (dlt). in
these studies, no tumor responses were seen, and stable disease,
present in 29% to 33% of patients, was reported but was of short
duration.
given the known schedule dependency of ftd and the limited activity with tas-102 administered on a once daily basis,
this phase i study was undertaken to further investigate the administration of tas-102 in divided daily doses. in this doseescalation analysis, patients received tas-102 three times a day
for 5 days per week for 2 weeks and then had a 2-week break.
cycles were repeated every 4 weeks until disease progression
or unacceptable toxicity. the primary endpoints were the mtd,
dlts, and optimal phase ii dose for this schedule.

patients and methods
patient eligibility
patients with histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic
solid tumors refractory to standard treatment or for which no
standard treatment existed were eligible. eligible patients were
≥18 years old, had a zubrod performance status score ≤2, had a
life expectancy >12 weeks, had no chemotherapy for >3 weeks
prior to study entry, and had measurable or evaluable disease per
response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist) (13).
other eligibility criteria included adequate liver (bilibrubin ≤
1.5 mg/dl, transaminases ≤2 times the upper limit of normal,
or ≤5 times if liver metastases), renal (creatinine ≤2 mg/dl), and
hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mul,
platelet count ≥100,000/mul, hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl). patients
with central nervous system involvement, patients undergoing
extensive radiation therapy within the past 6 weeks, and pregnant
women were excluded from the study.

pretreatment evaluation and study procedures
baseline studies included computed tomography, chest xray, and electrocardiography performed within 4 weeks prior
to treatment, and medical histories, physical examinations, and
laboratory tests performed within 1 week prior to treatment.
patients were evaluable for response if they completed at least
two courses of therapy with at least 75% of the planned dosage
or if they demonstrated progressive disease after one course of
therapy. patients were removed from the study if they demonstrated progressive disease, withdrew consent, exhibited severe
toxicity, or required more than two dose level reductions. toxicity was recorded according to the national cancer institute’s
common toxicity grading criteria (version 2.0). all patients
were treated at the m. d. anderson cancer center, and all pa-

tients gave written informed consent for this institutional review
board approved protocol.

study design, definition of dose-limiting
toxicity and maximum tolerated dose
this study was conducted using a typical dose-escalation
design. the starting dose of 80 mg/m2 /day was chosen because a
previous analysis found an mtd of 110 mg/m2 /day for tas-102
administered once daily on a cycle schedule similar to that used
here (11). cohorts of three patients were enrolled at each dose
level, and 3 patients were required to complete one cycle before
the next cohort could be entered into the study. if a dlt (defined
below) occurred at a particular dose level, an additional cohort
of 3 patients was enrolled at that dose level. if two or more dlts
occurred at a dose level, the next lower dose level represented
the mtd. intrapatient dose escalation was not allowed.
a dlt was defined as any of the following toxicities occurring during the first course of tas-102 administration at
any dose level: ≥grade 3 non-hematological toxicity (nausea/vomiting was considered only if it remained uncontrolled despite aggressive antiemetic treatment), or inability to take ≥75%
of the planned dose; grade 4 granulocytopenia lasting ≥3 days
or febrile (≥38.5◦ c) ≥grade 3 granulocytopenia of any duration; grade 4 thrombocytopenia or unresolved toxicities causing
more than a 2-week delay in taking the next scheduled dose.
before the next cycle of therapy could be initiated, patients
were required to have ≤grade 1 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding alopecia, a platelet count >100,000/mul, and a granulocyte count >1,500/mul. for patients who developed a grade 3 or
4 toxicity, tas-102 dose was reduced one dose level for the next
cycle. patients who required two dose reductions were removed
from the study.

study treatment
taiho pharmaceutical (tokyo, japan) provided tas-102 in
20 mg and 30 mg tablets. doses were rounded to the nearest
10 mg. tas-102 was taken orally with 8 ounces of water three
times a day for 5 consecutive days, followed by 2 days of rest
each week for 2 weeks. this treatment cycle was repeated every
4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. patients were advised to take tas-102 within 1 hour after a meal.
from march 27, 2003 until may 11, 2004, a total of 15 patients
were enrolled.

pharmacokinetic analysis
participation in pharmacokinetic studies was optional, and
only two patients (one receiving a dose of 80 mg/m2 /day and the
other receiving 70 mg/m2 /day) opted for this analysis. therefore,
data were very limited and not reported here.

statistical analysis
median time to treatment failure was estimated using the
kaplan-meier method. all calculations were done using the statistical analysis system (version 8.2).

patient characteristics
fifteen patients, 7 men and 8 women, were enrolled in
this study; their characteristics are outlined in table 1. median age was 60 (range 37–72). the majority of patients had a
performance status of 0–1. a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens had failed in these patients. the majority of patients had colorectal cancer, all of whom had progressed on prior
5-fu treatment.

tas-102 administration
a total of 53 treatment courses were administered. all patients received at least one treatment course with a median of 3
(range 1–8) courses per patient.
compliance with study drug administration was satisfactory,
with over 75% of tas-102 being administered in 92% of treatment courses.
the initial cohort comprised three patients receiving tas102 at a dose level of 80 mg/m2 /day (dose level 1). since one
patient developed a dlt of grade 4 granulocytopenia, an additional three patients were enrolled at the same dose level. one
more patient developed a dlt, grade 3 fatigue. thus, no dose
escalation occurred, and the next cohort was enrolled at a reduced dose level of 60 mg/m2 /day (dose level-1). no dlt was

observed at this dose level, and three patients were enrolled at an
intermediate dose level of 70 mg/m2 /day (dose level 0). again,
no dlt was observed, and 3 additional patients were enrolled,
without the occurrence of a dlt. however, at this dose level
four of the six patients required a dose reduction for course 2
due to non-dose limiting toxicity. a dose of 70 mg/m2 /day was
considered the mtd.
though a dose of 70 mg/m2 /day did not evoke any dlts,
only 8 cycles of therapy were administered to six patients at this
dose level. in contrast, 19 cycles were administered at the 60
mg/m2 /day dose level, with three patients receiving a total of 6
cycles. given the significant non-dlt hematologic toxicity at
the 70 mg/m2 /day dose level, a dose of 60 mg/m2 /day represents the recommended phase ii dose of tas-102 when administered three times a day for 5 days per week for 2 weeks every
28 days.
eight patients were removed from the study because of progressive disease (table 2). three patients were removed because
of toxicity: granulocytopenia in two and refractory nausea and
vomiting in one. one patient with colorectal cancer, who had
bulky liver metastatses at study entry, died of acute liver failure
due to progressive hepatic metastases during course 2 of therapy.
three patients were removed from the study at the investigators’
discretion.

the most common toxicities related to drug effect are reported in table 3. the major hematologic toxicity was granulocytopenia. granulocytopenia occurred in 87% of patients during
their first course of therapy, with seven patients experiencing it
at a grade 3 or 4 level. in one patient receiving 80 mg/m2 /day
of tas-102, granulocytopenia was dose-limiting. granulocytopenia did not appear to be cumulative; grade 3 or 4 toxicity
occurred in 7 of the first 15 courses and only 6 of the subsequent 38 courses. the granulocyte nadir occurred at a mean of
24 days. one patient developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and
no patient developed grade 3 or 4 anemia.

nonhematologic toxicity
frequent grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicities related to study treatment over all cycles were fatigue (60%),
diarrhea (40%), vomiting (27%), nausea (20%), and anorexia
(20%). fatigue was dose-limiting in one patient treated at the
80 mg/m2 /day dose level. two additional patients experienced
grade 3 fatigue during treatment. one patient developed grade
3 colitis, which was believed to be related to tas-102 administration, during the second cycle of therapy at the 60 mg/m2 /day
dose level; the colitis resolved with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. another patient treated at the 80 mg/m2 /day dose level
developed an entero-entero fistula during course 1. this fistula
occurred at the site of the patient’s known ileocolonic anastomotic colon cancer recurrence and was deemed unrelated to the
administration of the study drug.

day dosing schedule for tas-102. the stable disease rate of
60%, and the median time to treatment failure of 4 months in a
heavily treated patient population represent encouraging signals
of activity. though no formal responses were seen in this study
as assessed by recist criteria, five patients did demonstrate
radiographic reductions in tumor burden.
when tas-102 is administered three times per day on days
1-5 and 8-12 every four weeks, the mtd is 70 mg/m2 /day. although no dlts were observed at the 70 mg/m2 /day dose level,
the significant granulocytopenia, which resulted in a limited
number of cycles administered at this dose level was concerning,
and we recommend 60 mg/m2 /day as a safe dose for future phase
ii studies.
the toxicity profile demonstrated by tas-102 in this study
is similar to prior studies (10-12, 14). in all studies, the primary dose limiting toxicity identified is granulocytopenia. in

efficacy
all patients were evaluable for drug efficacy (table 2). one
patient developed progressive disease after receiving the first
course, and five other patients demonstrated progressive disease
after two courses. nine patients, three at each dose level, demonstrated stable disease at the time of initial restaging (after two
courses). the median time to treatment failure for all patients
was four months, and 2 patients were free of progression at 6
months. the best response according to recist criteria are
shown in fig. 1.

this study, 87% of patients developed grade 2 to 4 granulocytopenia with the first course of therapy, and seven patients required dose reductions for granulocytopenia following course 1.
gastrointestinal toxicity, represented by nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain, was common but was of
lower grade and, in general, did not necessitate dose reduction
or treatment cessation. this is similar to prior studies in which
gastrointestinal toxicity from tas-102 is generally mild with
only one gastrointestinal dose limiting toxicity reported, which
consisted of nausea and vomiting when tas-102 was administered at a dose of 160mg/m2 /day once daily for 5 days every
three weeks (12).
the clinical development of tas-102 has focused upon once
daily dosing schedules. the first phase i study of tas-102
treated fourteen 5-fu refractory colorectal cancer patients with
once daily tas-102 for 14 days every 3 weeks and recommended
50 mg/m2 /day as the phase ii dose (10). no responses were seen
with a short median time to treatment failure for all patients of
57 days. in a second phase i study evaluating once-daily dosing
on days 1-5 and 8-12 every 4 weeks, 24 primarily colorectal cancer patients were treated with no responses. the recommended
phase ii dose was 100 mg/m2 /day (11). a third phase i study
evaluated once-daily dosing of tas-102 for 5 days every three
weeks and recommended a dose of 160 mg/m2 /day for phase
ii evaluation (12). again, no responses were seen in these 37
primarily 5-fu refractory colorectal cancer patients, and the
median time to treatment failure was only 50 days.
the initial suggestion for the role of multiple daily dosings of tas-102 derives from the initial studies with ftd reported in 1971. in this study, no responses were seen in patients
treated with various daily doses ranging from 1.5 mg/kg/day
to 30 mg/kg/day, but when ftd was administered at a dose of
2.5 mg/kg/day every 3 hours, 28% of patients demonstrated a
>50% reduction in tumor size (7). recently, xenograft studies investigating the schedule dependence of ftd have demonstrated improved anti-tumor activity with multiple daily dosings
(9). a phase i study evaluating twice daily administration of
tas-102 in metastatic breast cancer did not report any objective responses but did show prolonged stable disease lasting
798

>12 weeks in 7 of 19 patients (14). granulocytopenia was the
primary toxicity and the recommended phase ii dose was 50
mg/m2 /day given twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 every four
weeks.
a limitation of this study is the lack of pharmacokinetic data.
participation in such analysis was optional, and only two patients
opted to be included in this analysis. due to the small numbers,
this data was not presented. previous phase i studies of tas-102
administered on a once daily dosing schedule have shown ftd
to have a tmax of 0.506 to 3.15 hours and t1/2 of 1.37 to 4.2 hours
(10–12).
a total of 77 patients have been treated on various phase
i studies evaluating once-daily dosing of tas-102. no tumor
responses were seen but stable disease, generally of short duration, occurred in 29% to 33% of patients (10-12). given the
encouraging stable disease rate of 60% and median time to treatment failure of 4 months, future investigation of tas-102 should
focus upon schedules utilizing multiple daily dosings. in addition, given the large number of primarily 5-fu refractory patients treated so far, future investigation of tas-102 may benefit from studying a 5-fu-naive patient population. attempts
to combine tas-102 with other therapies will require a careful consideration of the potential for overlapping hematologic
toxicity.
in conclusion, tas-102, when given three times daily on
days 1-5 and 8-12 every 28 days at 60 mg/m2 /day, is tolerable
and produced stable disease in nine of fifteen heavily pre-treated
patients.
