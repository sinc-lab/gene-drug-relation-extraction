[expression of soluble gm-csf-ralpha in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].  to evaluate soluble gm-csf-ralpha expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and its clinic significance, plasma concentration of solgm-ralpha in de novo 66 patients with aml was detected by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay, and the relationship between solgm-ralpha levels and various clinical parameters was analyzed. the result showed that the levels of solgm-ralpha in plasma of patients with aml were significantly higher than that in plasma of normal controls; the lowest level of solgm-ralpha was found in plasma of patients with aml-m3 (3897.75 +/- 2651.43 pg/ml), the highest level of solgm-ralpha was observed in plasma of patients with aml-m5 (9990.92 +/- 6325.43 pg/ml). patients with high level of solgm-ralpha were generally accompanied with a distinct clinical picture, including higher counts of white blood cell and myeloid precursors, as well as higher expression of cd34,  xxxg764xxx  and  xxxg527xxx  antigen. it is concluded that the high level of solgm-ralpha in plasma of patients may suggest aml poor prognosis and play a role in pathogenesis of leukemia, the gm-csf and its receptor solgm-ralpha needs further study.
