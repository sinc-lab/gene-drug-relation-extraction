abstract
phenotype and allele frequencies for erythrocyte glutathione
peroxidase ( xxxg943xxx ) polymorphism are reported in the mbugu and sango
(central african republic), goun (benin), and bamileke (cameroon) ethnic
groups. the  xxxg943xxx *2 allele frequencies (from 0.012 in the sango to 0.058 in the
bamileke) fit into the range of the data already known for the subsaharan
populations. the value of gpxl*2 for study of the genetic admixture between
negro and pygmy populations is suggested. three different unusual gpxl
electrotypes are described. finally, we hypothesize a n interaction between
 xxxg943xxx *2 and hb beta*s allelic products occurring in the sickle cells infected by
plasmodium falciparum.
for almost 15 years the staff of the laboratory of anthropology at the university of
rome “la sapienza” has been actively engaged in the anthropogenetic study of the
subsaharan populations. in particular, we
have concentrated on the biological interrelations of the subsaharan populations and the
possible interactions between the strong selective forces to which these groups are exposed
and some of their biological characteristics
(spedini et al., 1980a,b, 1981, 1982, 1983,
1985-86, 1986).
erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase ( xxxg943xxx :
ec 1.11.1.9) (mills, 1957) is a selenoenzyme
(flohe et al., 1973; rotruck et al., 1973) that
catalyzes the oxidation of  xxxd2213xxx  (gsh) by peroxides, and is thus vital in
the defence against oxidative damage. the
importance of this enzyme within the biochemical pathway of red blood cells is shown
by the haemolytic anaemia caused by gpxl
deficiency (necheles et al., 1970), along with
the noticeable variations of gpxl activity
observed in various haemolytic diseases: hbs
(chiu and lubin, 1979; das and nair, 1980;
ponzetto-zimmermann and natta, 1981; beretta et al., 1983); ggpd deficiency (beutler,
1977; swarup-mitra, 1977; gerli et al., 1982;

mavelli et al., 1984); alpha-thalassaemia
(beutler et al., 1977); and beta-thalassemia
(gerli et al., 1980).
the electrophoretic polymorphism of gpxl,
first reported in us blacks (beutler and west,
1974), is determined by the two codominant
alleles  xxxg943xxx *1 and  xxxg943xxx *2 (following the
nomenclature introduced by meera khan et
al., 1984a).the previous gpxl studies (beutler
and west, 1974; beutler et al., 1974; nurse
and jenkins, 1976; board, 1983; meera khan
et al., 1984a, 1986; destro-bisol et al., 1986;
meera khan, 1986) have pointed out that
 xxxg943xxx *2 is present only among subsaharans
and in populations with a probable african
genetic heritage, thus supporting the theory
of “african marker” value of  xxxg943xxx *2 (meera
khan et al., 1986).
some rare variants have been observed:
gpxl “musi” (beutler et al., 1974); gpxl
“lebanese” homozygous and heterozygous
variants (board, 1983); gpxl “djuka” or
gpxl 3-1 and gpxl 4-1 (meera khan et al.,
1984b).however, there have been no reported
family studies demonstrating the genetic

inheritance of any of these variants. recently
prof. p. meera khan informed us that he had
encountered three further gpxl variants,
including a silent allele in some jewish
populations.
interestingly, the catalytic activity of the
 xxxg943xxx *2 allele product was found to be almost
twice that of  xxxg943xxx *1 (meera khan et al.,
1986). given the importance of the gpxl
physiological role and the considerably higher
activity of the  xxxg943xxx *2 allele product, it
would be interesting to investigate a possible
selective role of the latter polymorphism.
we have previously reported the gpxl frequencies obtained from the beti, bateke, and
babenga populations of the congo (destrobisol et al., 1986).in this paper we present the
gpxl data relative to the goun (benin),
mbugu and sango [central african republic
(car)], and bamileke (cameroon) populations. all the groups examined have been
settled in central-western africa for some
time, where they and other populations have
interacted sometimes peacefully, sometimes
violently, and where there has been a great
spreading of malarial parasites (fig. 1).
populations

according to the linguistic classification of
greenberg (1980), the goun, sango, and
mbugu populations belong to the non-bantu
or west african family of the niger-congo

cluster, while the bamileke of cameroon fit
into the bantu “lato-sensu” group of the
benue congo family. the goun live in the
southern region of benin and the mbugu and
sango in the basse kotto district on the
banks of the ubangui river in the car.
details of the history and distribution of
some other genetic markers in the examined
populations are reported in spedini et al.,
1980a and destro-bisol et al., 1987 for the
goun; spedini et al., 1983 and destro-bisol et
al., 1987 for the mbugu and sango; and
spedini et al., 1988, in preparation for the
bamileke.
materials and methods

the material included blood samples from
45 mbugu and 47 sango of the basse kotto
district (car) collected in 1979 and from 18
goun residing in port0 novo (benin) collected in 1980. the methods of blood collection, shipment, and storage are reported in
spedini et al. (1983). in addition, during a n
expedition led by g.s. in 1985 in southwestern cameroon, 452 blood samples were
collected from a s many bamileke residing in
three different parts of the department of
moungo: 259 from manengole village, 116
from kongsamba town (including 11related
individuals), and 77 from ndoungue village,
of which 54 were from pregnant women. the
blood samples, obtained by venipuncture,

were collected in k3-edta tubes a s in our
previous gpxl survey (destro-bisol et al.,
1986). the samples were separated, salinewashed, and then stored separately a s serum
and washed packed  xxxd187xxx  a t -20°c within
12 hours of collection in the laboratory of the
centres des grandes endemies a t kongsamba. the samples were then flown on ice to
rome within 12days and transported directly
to the laboratory of anthropology at the
university of rome “la sapienza,” where
they were stored at -30°c before electrophoresis.
preparation of samples and electrophoretic
procedures were performed in accordance
with meera khan et al. (1984a), except that
0.05 m dithiothreitol (dtt) was used as lysis
solution instead of 0.1 m 2- xxxd26xxx 
( xxxd26xxx ).samples exhibiting unusual patterns
were treated by 0.05 or 0.1 m dtt, 1m or 2 m
 xxxd26xxx , or 0.05 m gsh.
for gene counting only unrelated individuals were taken into account.
results

of the 562 samples analyzed, 492 were easily typed a s one of the previously reported
gpxl 1,2-1, and 2 phenotypes; the remaining
70 samples showed unusual electrotypes (fig.
2). i n order to avoid any mistyping caused by

protein denaturation, the samples exhibiting
unusual electrotypes were treated,with  xxxd26xxx 
and gsh solutions (beutler and west, 1974),
but no change in the electrophoretic pattern
was observed in any of these samples.
of the bamileke samples, 53 showed a single gpxl band slightly faster than that of
the gpxl 1 type. this unusual electrotype
was named “bamileke.” it was possible to
perform a family analysis for one carrier of
“bamileke” variant of the nkongsamba
group, who was excluded from gene counting.
the paternity was confirmed by the determination of 12 other gene markers, including
red cell enzymes and serum proteins; both
parents of the propositus showed the gpxl 1
phenotype. this sample and the other identical variants were therefore considered a s
gpxl 1 types. in addition, gpxl 1 and
“bamileke” electrotypes were found to be
undistinguishable by ultrathin-layer polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing in the range
of ph 4-6 (destro-bisoland briziobello, 1987).
thirteen mbugu and four sango showed
two different unusual electrotypes, which we
named “a” and “b.” for these last two variants, family data were not available; as a
precautionary measure, they were excluded
from gene counting. the results are summarized in table 1.

discussion

unusual variants
in terms of electrophoretic mobility and the
single banded pattern, the variant phenotypes encountered among the bamileke resemble the gpxl “musi” variant, previously
found in two related individuals affected by
refractory anaemia and in several cord blood
samples (beutler et al., 1974). it is interesting
to note that 33 of the 53 “bamileke” variants
were found in the group of 54 pregnant
women included in the ndongue sample.
unfortunately, the “musi” sample was not
available for a comparison (prof. e. beutler,
scripps foundation, la jolla, ca, personal
communication). however, the fact that for
both the “bamileke” and the “musi” variants
the patterns of inheritance did not confirm
the genetic origin of the changed electrophoretic mobility supports the identity of these
two variants.
it is worth mentioning that a remarkable
decrease in the selenium content was found
in both the blood of pregnant women and in

cord blood (rudolph and wong, 1978; behne
and wolters, 1979; butler et al., 1982;pleban
et al., 1982).these findings led us to suggest
tentatively that a scarcity of blood selenium
could be related to the changed electrophoretic mobility of the “musi” variants found in
the cord blood samples and of the “bamileke”
variants found among the pregnant women
of ndoungue. it is well known that lack of a n
inorganic element of the prosthetic group of
proteins can cause a change in their conformation and, consequently, a different electrophoretic mobility. obviously our hypothesis await further experimental confirmations.
two different unusual electrophoretic variants, which we have called “a’ and “b,”
were found in the car populations. they
were apparently heterozygotes for the common gpxl allele and two further gpxl
alleles. “a” and “b” variants showed a n electrophoretic mobility very similar to those of
the “lebanese variants” (board, 1983).however, owing to the low activity of the “lebanese variants” a t our disposal, we could not
reach a definite conclusion. prof. p. meera

glutathione peroxidase in africa

khan, after examining the photograph shown
in figure 2, suggested that the “ a ’ and “b”
variants could be respectively the gpxl 3-1
(found among the djuka of surinam: meera
khan et al., 1986) and gpxl 4-1 (previously
found in a negro: meera khan et al., 1984b).
the djuka of surinam are descendants of
captives from central-western africa and
probably from a wider region of west africa
(meera khan et al., 1986). the geographic
location of their forefathers is therefore in
accordance with the suggested identity between the gpxl “djuka” and “a” variants.

gpxl*2 allele as anthropological marker
all the populations examined were characterized by polymorphic frequencies of  xxxg943xxx *2
(from 0.012 in the sango to 0.058 in the bamileke), which fit into the range of values
reported for the subsaharan populations
(table 2). the  xxxg943xxx *2 allele was not found in
any population of non-african origin, with

the exception of ashkenazy jews of the
united states and punjabis of india; this
finding could be the result of their ancient
genetic admixture with african populations
(mourant et al., 1976; meera khan et al.,
1984a).the data obtained by us strongly support the theory of the “african marker” value
of  xxxg943xxx *2 (meera khan et al., 1984a) and
enable us to outline more exhaustively the
gpxl distribution in subsaharan africa.
when we group the sudanic population on
one side and the bantu on the other, the
 xxxg943xxx *2 frequencies do not show a noteworthy variation. these results are in accordance with previous findings on other genetic
polymorphisms in subsaharan africa.
as to the pygmies, data obtained from the
babenga of the congo are in line with the low
frequencies (babinga of the car, twa of
rwanda) or absence (mbuti of zaire and
western pygmies from cameroon) of the
 xxxg943xxx *2 noticed in the other pygmy groups.

notion that the presence of  xxxg943xxx *2 in the

allow us to suggest that  xxxg943xxx *2 could be a
valuable marker in the study of the genetic
admixture between negro and pygmy populations.
