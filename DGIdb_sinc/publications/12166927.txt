abstract: a series of 6r-alkyl-substituted analogues of chenodeoxycholic acid ( xxxd1660xxx ) were synthesized and evaluated as
potential  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr) ligands. among them, 6rethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid ( xxxd2764xxx ) was shown to be a very
potent and selective fxr agonist (ec50 ) 99 nm) and to be
endowed with anticholeretic activity in an in vivo rat model
of cholestasis.

introduction. the  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr, nrih4)
is an orphan member of the superfamily of nuclear
receptors, a growing ensemble of ligand-dependent
transcription factors that are activated by small, lipophilic hormones.1 fxr was originally proposed to be a
receptor for the intermediary metabolite  xxxd2085xxx .2
however,  xxxd2085xxx  does not bind to fxr and supraphysiological concentrations were required to activate
the receptor. in 1999, three groups independently
proposed fxr as a nuclear receptor for bile acids (ba).3

these studies revealed that physiological concentrations
of ba bound and activated fxr, with the primary bile
acid chenodeoxycholic ( xxxd1660xxx , 1, chart 1) being the
most potent ligand with ec50 values ranging between
10 and 50 µm.3 lithocholic (lca, 2) and deoxycholic
(dca, 3) acid also activate fxr, while ursodeoxycholic
acid ( xxxd3479xxx , 4) is inactive. nonsteroid ligands for fxr
have also been discovered, of which the combinatorial
chemistry-derived isoxazole gw4064 (5) is the most
potent.4

scheme 1a
figure 1. fxr regulates the expression of target genes
involved in bile acids and cholesterol homeostasis.

fxr shares a common modular architecture with the
other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily,
comprising a highly conserved dna binding domain
(dbd) and a carboxy-terminal ligand binding domain
(lbd). the dbd recognizes specific dna sequences,
known as response elements, within the enhancer
region of the receptor’s target genes. fxr binds as a
heterodimer with the 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rxr)
to an ir-1 response element. the binding of a small,
lipophilic ligand to the lbd results in the recruitment
of transcriptional coactivators (e.g., src1), which couple
the receptor to the cellular transcriptional machinery.5
in its capacity as a ba receptor, fxr regulates the
expression of several target genes involved in the ba
homeostasis (figure 1). in particular, fxr indirectly
represses the expression of the ba biosynthetic enzymes
cyp7a and cyp8b by increasing the levels of the
inhibitory nuclear receptor shp in the liver and intestine.6 ba-activated fxr also positively regulates the
expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the
transport of ba, including i- xxxg114xxx ,  xxxg11xxx , and  xxxg15xxx .7
although many of the molecular mechanisms involved
in fxr-mediated gene transcription regulation remain
to be fully understood, a picture has emerged of the role
of this receptor in ba and cholesterol homeostasis.8
another intriguing therapeutic opportunity associated
with fxr modulation is the control of bile flow. indeed,
the fxr-mediated activation of shp causes the negative
feedback regulation of ntcp, the principal ba transporter in the liver. notably, fxr null mice display
defects in ba homeostasis such as elevated serum ba,
reduced ba pools, and reduced fecal ba secretion.9 so,
fxr may coordinate an integrated pathway aimed at
the down-regulation of ba import and synthesis. the
regulation of this process may protect hepatocytes from
ba toxicity.
cholestasis is a condition characterized by an impairment or cessation of bile flow that occurs in a variety of
human liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis,
primary sclerosing cholangitis, cystic fibrosis, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.10 currently, drug
treatment for cholestasis is limited to the secondary ba
 xxxd3479xxx  (4)11 whose long-term efficacy remains unproven.
the molecular mechanism of action of  xxxd3479xxx  (4) is
unknown, although its anticholestatic activity may be
due in part to the displacement of more hydrophobic ba
from the hepatocyte. given the proposed role of fxr in
ba biosynthesis and transport from the liver, we sought

to identify potent ba-based ligands. we decided to

results. initially, we surveyed a number of compounds previously synthesized in our laboratory12 and
found that 6r-methyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (6-mecdca, 6a) was a more potent fxr agonist than  xxxd1660xxx  (1)
(table 1). this result prompted us to synthesize  xxxd1660xxx 
analogues 6b-d characterized by increasingly bulkier
6r-substituents. the synthetic route to the 6r-alkyl
 xxxd1660xxx  analogues 6a-d is outlined in scheme 1. treatment of the 3-tetrahydropyranyloxy derivative 8 of
7-keto-lithocholic acid (7) with methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-,
and benzyl bromide, respectively, at -78 °c using
lithium diisopropylamide as a base and hmpta/tetrahydrofuran (thf) as solvents, followed by treatment
with methanolic hcl, afforded the corresponding methyl
3r-hydroxy-7keto-6r-methyl-5beta-cholan-24-oate (9a),
methyl 3r-hydroxy-7keto-6r-ethyl-5beta-cholan-24-oate (9b),
methyl 3r-hydroxy-7keto-6r-propyl-5beta-cholan-24-oate
(9c), and methyl 3r-hydroxy-7keto-6r-benzyl-5beta-cholan24-oate (9d) in 22, 12, 5, and 13% yield, respectively.
finally, selective reduction of the 6r-alkyl-7-keto bile
acid methyl esters 9a-d with sodium borohydride13 and
subsequent hydrolysis of the methyl ester with alkali
afforded the desired 3r,7r-dihydroxy-6r-alkyl-5beta-cholan24-oic acids 6a-d.14 it is worth noting that in each case
only the 6r-alkyl derivative is formed, a selectivity that

can be explained by the 1,3-diaxial interaction that
would be experienced by a  xxxd1946xxx -alkyl derivative with the
c19 methyl group.
biology: in vitro characterization. all new compounds were tested in an established cell-free ligand
sensing assay, which measured the ligand-dependent
recruitment of an src1 peptide to fxr by fluorescence
resonance energy transfer.4 the results, reported in
table 1, show that  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) is a very potent fxr
agonist with an ec50 of 99 nm. also, the 6r-mecdca
(6a) and 6r-prcdca (6c) derivatives demonstrated
good potency as fxr agonists, while the 6r-bncdca
derivative (6d) was essentially inactive.
in a reporter gene, (hsp70ecre)2-tk-luc,6a assay
employing the full length human fxr in huh7 cells,
 xxxd2764xxx  (6b) was a potent full agonist with an ec50
of 85 nm (figure 2). when tested across a standard
panel (described in ref 6a) of nuclear receptor lbdgal4 chimeric receptors,4 1 µm 6b activated only the
fxr(lbd)-gal4 chimera (data not shown). no significant activation of other receptors was seen at 1 µm.
thus, 6b is a potent and selective steroidal fxr agonist.
biology: in vivo characterization in an animal
model of cholestasis. the most potent derivative
 xxxd2764xxx  (6b) was selected for further characterization
in an in vivo model of cholestasis. male wistar rats
(225-300 g) were catheterized at the right jugular vein
using pe-50 polyethylene tubing, and the abdomen was
opened through a midline incision. the common bile
duct was isolated and cannulated. saline solution was
infused via the external jugular vein at the same
infusion rate used later for ba, until a steady state in
the bile flow was reached (75 min). ba were then
dissolved in saline solution with 2% bovine serum
albumin, ph 7.4, and infused for 90 min followed by 60
min of saline infusion. during the treatment, bile
samples were collected every 15 min and weighed in
order to determine the bile flow. two protocols were
used. in the first protocol, rats were randomly assigned
to receive one of the following ba: lca (2),  xxxd2764xxx 
(6b), or  xxxd1660xxx  (1) at 1.0, 1.5, or 3 µmol/kg/min.  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) was also infused at a higher dose (7 µmol/kg/
min). in the second protocol, cholestasis was induced
by intravenous infusion of lca (2). three groups of
animals were treated as follows: lca (2) (3 µmol/kg/
min) alone, lca (2) plus  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) (3 µmol/kg/min),
or lca (2) plus  xxxd1660xxx  (1) (3 µmol/kg/min). the results
are shown in figure 3. administration of lca alone at

a rate of 3 µmol/kg/min caused a dramatic reduction in
bile flow and extensive necrosis of liver cells (figure 4b,
arrow).
at lower doses, lca (2) was unable to induce cholestasis. neither  xxxd1660xxx  (1) nor  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) induced
cholestasis when administered alone. in the coinfusion
protocol,  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) dosed at a rate of 3 µmol/kg/
min fully reversed the impairment of bile flow and
protected against liver cell injury induced by 3 µmol/
kg/min of lca (2) (figure 4c). although  xxxd2764xxx  (6b)
was effective in protecting against cholestasis induced
by lca (2), the effect was lost over time, and a drop in
bile flow was observed as expected when the infusion
of the compound was stopped. in contrast,  xxxd1660xxx  (1) at
doses up to 7 µmol/kg/min failed to protect against
colestasis caused by lca (2) (data not shown), consistent with its low fxr affinity. higher doses of  xxxd1660xxx 
(1) coinfused with lca (2) were lethal (data not shown).
discussion. the quest for potent and selective fxr
ligands is driven by the need to further clarify the
physiological and pathophysiological role of this nuclear
ba receptor. we have reported here the synthesis and
the preliminary evaluation of a series of potent steroidal

fxr agonists. compound 6b is almost 2 orders of
magnitude more potent than  xxxd1660xxx  (1), the putative
physiological fxr ligand. moreover, the synthesis of a
series of 6r-substituted  xxxd1660xxx  derivatives has allowed
us to delineate a key structure-activity relationship
within the steroidal skeleton. indeed, our results point
to the existence of a discrete hydrophobic pocket in the
receptor, whose size is particularly suited to small linear
alkyl substituents. although further experiments are
needed to fully characterize compounds 6a-d, they
appear to be useful chemical tools to probe the biological
function of fxr. thus, 6b was active in an in vivo model
of cholestasis, and when infused to rats codosed with
lca (2), it prevented bile flow impairment caused by
this agent. remarkably, despite its high lipophilicity,
6b had no intrinsic cholestatic activity and did not show
any evidence of acute liver toxicity.
in conclusion, we report the identification of a potent
and selective steroidal fxr agonist,  xxxd2764xxx  (6b).
importantly, not only did  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) promote bile
flow but it also protected hepatocytes against acute
necrosis caused by lca. thus, fxr activation not only
regulates endogenous bile acid synthesis but also activates protective pathways in hepatocytes challenged
with toxic xenobiotics.  xxxd2764xxx  (6b) and related
analogues may, therefore, offer a rational approach to
the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. studies aimed
at further elucidating the potential of fxr modulators
in cholestasis as well as in other therapeutic areas are
under way.
