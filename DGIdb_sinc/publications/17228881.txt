the secretory isozyme of human carbonic anhydrase (hca,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1), hca vi, has been cloned, expressed,
and purified in a bacterial expression system. the kinetic parameters for the co2 hydration reaction proved
hca vi to possess a kcat of 3.4 × 105 s-1 and kcat/km of 4.9 × 107 m-1 s-1 (at ph 7.5 and 20 °c). hca vi
has a significant catalytic activity for the physiological reaction on the same order of magnitude as the
ubiquitous isoform ca i or the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme ca ix. a series of sulfonamides
and one sulfamate have been tested for their interaction with this isozyme. simple benzenesulfonamides
were rather ineffective hca vi inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range of 1090-6680 nm. better
inhibitors were detected among such derivatives bearing 2- or 4-amino-, 4-aminomethyl-, or 4-hydroxymethyl
moieties or among halogenated sulfanilamides (ki values of 608-955 nm). some clinically used compounds,
such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx ,  xxxd1872xxx ,  xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx ,
topiramate, sulpiride, and indisulam, or the orphan drug  xxxd307xxx , showed effective hca vi inhibitory
activity, with inhibition constants of 0.8-79 nm. the best inhibitors were  xxxd367xxx  and sulpiride (ki
values of 0.8-0.9 nm), the latter compound being also a ca vi-selective inhibitor. the metallic taste
reported as a side effect after the treatment with systemic sulfonamides may be due to the inhibition of the
salivary ca vi. some of the compounds investigated in this study might be used as additives in toothpastes
for reducing the acidification produced by the relevant co2 hydrase activity of enamel ca vi, which leads
to the formation of protons and bicarbonate and may have a role in cariogenesis.
introduction
isozyme vi is the only secreted form among the 16 carbonic
anhydrases (cas,  xxxg40xxx   xxxg41xxx   xxxg671xxx   xxxg703xxx .1) described up to now in
mammals.1-3 indeed, this family of metalloenzymes is widespread all over the phylogenetic tree,4 being fundamental to a
variety of physiological processes. in fact, by catalyzing the
interconversion between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, with
generation of a proton, cas operate on three very simple
molecules/ions involved in a variety of critical life processes.
among them, the most important ones are ph regulation;
respiration; secretion of electrolytes; biosynthesis of some
important biomolecules such as urea, glucose, lipids, and
pyrimidines; excretion of acid and salts; carcinogenesis; signalling; etc.1-7 different isozymes among the 16 presently known
participate in such processes.1-7 indeed, these isoforms present
a very diverse cellular localization, catalytic activity, and
susceptibility to be inhibited/activated by various endogenous
or exogenous regulators of activity.1-7 in humans, only 15 of
the 16 mammalian isoforms are present, due to the fact that
ca xv is encoded by a pseudogene in all primates investigated
so far.8 among these remaining 15 isoforms, 12 possess catalytic
activity for the co2 hydration reaction, whereas ca viii, x,
and xi are devoid of this activity, as these proteins lack one or
more histidine residues coordinating the catalytically critical zn(ii) ion within the enzyme active site.9 indeed, ca i-iii, vii,
and xiii are soluble, cytosolic isozymes, ca iv and xv are
extracellular, membrane-anchored enzymes by means of glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (gpi) tails, and ca va and vb are

mitochondrial enzymes, whereas ca ix, xii, and xiv are
transmembrane proteins with the active site situated outside the
cell.1-8 ca vi, the only secreted ca isoform, has been initially
identified in sheep saliva and parotid glands by fernley’s group
in 1979.10,11 ca vi was thereafter shown to be secreted in saliva,
tears, and milk of all mammals,10-14 where it may play important
physiological roles, most of which are little understood at this
moment. more recently, the enzyme was also evidenced in
enamel organs in rodent teeth,15 but it is not well understood
whether the enzyme is secreted into the enamel layers or onto
the intercellular spaces of the enamel organ.
there are quite conflicting literature data11,12 regarding the
catalytic activity of ca vi and virtually no inhibition study of
this enzyme. here we present the first study regarding the dna
cloning, purification, enzymatic characterization, and inhibition
data with a number of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides and
one sulfamate of the human secreted isoform hca vi. this is
in fact the only human ca that was not investigated up to now
for its inhibition by the main class of ca inhibitors (cais),
i.e., the sulfonamides and their related derivatives (sulfamates,
sulfamides). as many pharmacological agents possess such
functional groups (of the x-so2nh2 type, where x is carbon,
oxygen, or nitrogen), this study may reveal on one hand possible
side effects of clinically used drugs, but may be also useful for
the drug design of cais with novel applications that would
specifically target this poorly understood isozyme.

pharmacological agents,3b whereas topiramate (tpm) is a widely
used antiepileptic drug.16 sulpiride (slp)17 and indisulam
(ind)18 were recently shown by this group to belong to this
class of pharmacological agents. compounds 1, 2, 4-6, 11, 12,
18-20, 23 and  xxxd810xxx  through slp are commercially available
or were a gift from the company producing them (see experimental section for details), whereas 3,19 7-10,19 13-17,20 21,21
22,22 and 24,23 were prepared as reported earlier by this group.
inhibition data of these sulfonamides and the sulfamate tpm
against isozymes hca i, ii, vi, and ix are shown in table 2.

discussion
hca vi cloning, purification, and catalytic activity. the
secretory isoform hca vi contains an n-terminal 17 amino acid
signal sequence typical for secreted proteins.11a in this work,
we initially tried to obtain the truncated enzyme lacking the
n-terminal 17 amino acid residues for a gst-hca vi
construct. however, we failed to obtain any bacterial colony
expressing the truncated hca vi protein. the full-length enzyme
was on the other hand obtained in soluble form without
complications by the gst-fusion protein method.24 a similar
phenomenon was previously experienced during the construction
of the gst-hca vb fusion protein: no truncated enzyme
could be obtained, but the full length enzyme was successfully
cloned and purified.24 although the exact reasons for such
phenomena are uncertain, it is likely that ectopically overexpressed hcas in the cytoplasm of bacteria (normally ca vb
is expressed in the mitochondria and ca vi is secreted out of
the cell) are toxic to the prokaryotic cell (escherichia coli) used
for their production.
to date, complete amino acid sequences in the open reading
frame of three hca vi clones have been deposited in the
genbank, with the accession numbers nm_001215, m57892,
and af128411. the amino acid sequence of our clone was
identical to that of clone nm_001215. the other two clones
showed different amino acid usage at three sites, i.e., residues
ser:gly at position 70 (numbering is based on ca i sequence),
ser:thr at position 130, and asn:lys at position 253. considering the significance of these amino acids in the ca active site
(mainly those in positions 70 and 130, which are adjacent to
two critical residues involved in the binding of inhibitors/
activators,16,17,25,26 i.e., amino acids 69 and 131), these substitutions probably represent normal polymorphisms.
the amino acid sequence of the ca domain, which was
deduced from the cdna sequence of our hca vi clone, was
aligned with that of three ca isozymes, hca i, hca ii, and
hca ix (figure 1). hca vi showed an overall similarity of
31-40% with these isozymes. the highest similarity was

observed with hca ix, probably because both hca vi and ca
ix are extracellular isozymes. in figure 1, the 36 residues that
were previously shown to form the active site cavity in all
r-cas27-29 are indicated by a mixture of an asterisk, plus sign,
and “z” above the hca i sequence. among these active site
residues, 25 amino acids are conserved between hca vi and
hca ii, the isozyme showing the strongest ca activity in the
r-ca family (table 1). interestingly, hca i and hca ix also
showed comparable sequence homology of 24 and 26 amino
acid residues with hca ii, respectively, whereas the overall hca
vi vs hca i homology was 30.8%, that of hca vi vs hca ii
was 34.1%, and that of hca vi vs hca ix was 39.8%.
however, it is important to note that all the amino acid residues
that are critical in the ca catalytic cycle are conserved in all
these isozymes: (i) the three zinc ligands, his94, -96, and -119;
(ii) the “gate-keeping” residues thr199 and glu106, which orient
the substrate in the right position to be attacked by the zincbound hydroxide ion; and (iii) his64, the proton shuttle residue,

which transfers protons from the zinc-bound water molecule
toward the external medium, leading to the generation of the
active form of the enzyme with hydroxide as the fourth zinc
ligand.1-4 thus, hca vi has all the requisites to show a catalytic
activity comparable to that of isozymes i, ii, or ix investigated
in great detail earlier.1 there are, however, several amino acid
residues that are characteristic only to ca vi among the r-ca
isozymes, such as among those in positions 20, 31, 40, 50, 60,
65, 69, 91, 93, 131, 170, 171, 193, 205, 207, and 209 (figure
1). in some cases, these amino acids are buried within the protein
structure, but some of them are known to be important for the
active site architecture, being involved in the binding of
inhibitors and/or activators.5,7,16-26,30 among these amino acid
substutions typical for the secreted form ca vi, we should
mention thr65, which is nearby the conserved proton shuttle
residue of all r-cas, his64. this amino acid is a ser in ca i
and ix, and an ala in ca ii. it is tempting to hypothesize that
the decreased catalytic efficiency of ca i, vi, and ix as

384

figure 3.

compared to ca ii (possessing ala in this position) may be
due to the fact that the bulkier ser/thr residues (as compared
to ala) are interfering with the flip movement of his64. in fact,
it is well-known that this proton shuttle residue has a great
mobility in order to assist the proton-transfer processes between
the enzyme active site and the environment, being observed in
many x-ray crystal structures with at least two conformation,
the “in” and “out” ones.30 residues 69 and 131, which are an
ile and tyr in ca vi, respectively, were shown to be involved
in the binding of inhibitors/activators in several other isozymes.16-30
furthermore, residues close to the zinc ligands, e.g., those in
positions 91 and 93, are also characteristic only of ca vi
(figure 1). all these particular amino acids explain in fact the
unique activity and inhibition profile of this isozyme, as
compared to all other characterized r-cas investigated up to
now (see the kinetics and inhibitor binding discussion later in
the text).
the kinetic parameters for the co2 hydration reaction
catalyzed by this newly purified recombinant isozyme, hca vi,
as well as for other isoforms which are targets for the drug
design (such as hca i, ii, va, vb, ix, and xii), are shown in
table 1. as stressed in the introduction, literature data regarding
the catalytic activity of hca vi are rather conflicting,11,12 with
murakami and sly12 reporting hca vi to have about 1% of the
catalytic activity of hca ii, whereas fernley11 showed the
secreted isoform to be much more active, with a catalytic activity
of around 25-30% that of the perfectly evolved catalyst, which
is hca ii. it should be mentioned that both groups used hca
vi purified from saliva by sulfonamide column chromatography.
the catalytic activity of our recombinant isoform, which is
practically free of any contaminant protein, showed hca vi to
have indeed a lower catalytic activity as compared to hca ii,
but on the same order of magnitude as that of the highly
abundant, cytosolic isoform hca i (table 1). indeed, both
isoforms have very similar kcat and almost an identical kcat/km,

close to 5.0 × 107 m-1 s-1 (at ph 7.5 and 20 °c; see table 1).
this is indeed around 33% the catalytic activity (as turnover
number) of hca ii. thus, hca vi is less effective than hca ii
or hca vb, as a catalyst for co2 hydration to bicarbonate, but
it has a comparable activity with that of two highly investigated
and important isozymes, such as ca i (cytosolic isoform) and
ix (transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme). furthermore,
hca vi is also more active than isozymes iii, va, or xii, some
of which were previously shown to be important drug targets.28,29 it may be also observed from the data of table 1 that
all these isozymes except ca iii are susceptible to inhibition
by acetazolamide ( xxxd810xxx ), the most investigated cai (see
extensive discussion later in the text).1
chemistry and hca vi inhibition. sulfonamides and
sulfamates are among the clinically used cais.1-4,16 a library
of such derivatives, including the simple aromatic/heteroaromatic derivatives 1-24 and the clinically used compounds  xxxd810xxx 
through ind [ xxxd307xxx  (bza) is an orphan drug]1 were
included in this study, basically for two reasons: (i) most of
the compounds 1-24 were used as lead molecules for designing
potent inhibitors targeting other ca isozymes, such as ca i,
ii, iv, va, vii, ix, and xii among others, by the tail approach
(i.e., derivatization of the free amino/hydrazine/hydroxy moieties
contained in the molecule).1,3,4,16-24 thus, it in not improbable
that detecting good hca vi inhibitors among such simple
sulfonamides may thereafter lead to the development of more
effective inhibitors; (ii) the inhibition profile against hca vi
of the clinically used compounds  xxxd810xxx  through ind may be
important both for explaining possible side effects of some of
these drugs as well as for the design of novel therapeutic
applications, for them or some of their derivatives. table 2
shows ca vi inhibition data with the panel of sulfonamides
1-24 and  xxxd810xxx  through ind and the sulfamate tpm. hca i,
ii, and ix inhibition data of the same compounds have been
included for the sake of comparison, in order to better understand

a errors are in the range of 5-10% of the shown data, from three different
assays. data of isoforms i, ii, and ix are from refs 24b,c. b ki against the

the significance of the new data presented here. in fact, both
ca ii and ca ix are well-established drug targets in this family
of enzymes, and their inhibitors are antiglaucoma or anticancer
drugs/diagnostic tools.1-4 hca i is on the other hand a widely
spread isoform in many tissues/organs, but its role is presently
less well understood.1-4
the following sar may be drawn from the inhibition data
of table 2: (i) a first group of sulfonamides, including 3-5,
8-10, 21, 22, and 24, showed weak ca vi inhibitory activity,
with ki values in the range of 1090-6680 nm. it may be
observed that all these compounds are simple benzenesulfonamide derivatives, possibly 2- or 4-substituted with compact
groups of the hydrazino, methyl, aminomethyl, or hydroxymethyl/ethyl type, whereas three of them (8-10) are halogenosulfanilamides. it must be also noted that most of these
derivatives act as much better inhibitors of isoforms ca ii and
ix and are generally quite weak ca i inhibitors (table 2). (ii)
medium-potency hca vi inhibitors were compounds 1, 2, 6,
11-14, and 23, which showed ki values in the range of 608955 nm. these sulfonamides also belong to rather heterogeneous
classes, some of them being structurally related to the compounds mentioned above (such as the simple orthanilamide 1
and sulfanilamide 2 or some of their derivatives, of type 6 and
23). compounds 11 and 12 are 1,3-benzenedisulfonamide
derivatives, whereas 13 and 14 are heterocyclic sulfonamides,
being in fact the precursors of two widely clinically used
drugs,1-4 acetazolamide ( xxxd810xxx ) and  xxxd2592xxx  (mza),

respectively. as for the derivatives mentioned earlier, these
sulfonamides also generally act as much better ca ii/ca ix
inhibitors and weak ca i inhibitors. (iii) strong ca vi inhibitors
were detected among the following derivatives: 7, 15-20,  xxxd810xxx ,
mza, eza, dcp, dza, bza, tpm, and ind, which showed
excellent inhibition profiles, with ki values in the range of 10114 nm. it may be observed that the clinically used cais act
as very good ca vi inhibitors. other interesting compounds
were fluorosulfanilamide 7, bza and its 4-amino derivative 15,
the structurally related sulfanilated-sulfonamides 16 and 17, the
pyrimidine derivative 18, the  xxxd2058xxx  precursor 19, and
chlorazolamide 20. it is obvious that potent ca vi inhibitors
can be obtained both from the class of the substituted benzensulfonamides, as well as those belonging to the heterocyclic
sulfonamide classes, e.g., 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, 1,3,4thiadiazoline-2-sulfonamide,  xxxd304xxx -2-sulfonamide, and
thienothiopyran-s,s-dioxide-2-sulfonamide derivatives among
others. however, the most interesting fact that emerged in this
study was that two clinically used compounds,  xxxd367xxx 
(brz) and sulpiride (slp), act as subnanomolar inhibitors of
ca vi, with inhibition constants of 0.9 and 0.8 nm, respectively
(table 2). among the compounds in this group of potent ca
vi inhibitors, some of them, such as 15-20, eza, bza, dcp,
tpm, and ind, generally act as better ca ii and ca ix than
ca vi inhibitors, whereas their affinity for ca i is generally
low. however, other derivatives (such as  xxxd810xxx , mza, brz,
and slp) inhibited better ca vi than any other known/
investigated ca isozyme, and this is indeed a very important
finding. thus, slp can be considered as an isozyme vi-selective
inhibitor, since its selectivity ratio for inhibiting ca vi over
ca ii is 50, the selectivity ratio for the inhibition of ca vi
over ca ix is 120, and that of inhibiting ca vi over ca i is
15 000 (this compound is a very weak ca i inhibitor).17
the inhibition data obtained in this study are quite different
from the data reported by murakami and sly,12 who reported
an inhibition constant of 1.1 µm for  xxxd810xxx , 0.56 µm for mza,
and 9.9 µm for sulfanilamide 2. a possible explanation for the
discrepancy with our data is confered by the different glycosylation of hca vi protein. distinct glycoforms of bovine ca
vi, between the parotid and submaxillary gland, were reported
to be caused by different expression of certain types of
glycosyltrasnferases by hooper et al.34 murakami and sly12
purified their hca vi from human saliva, whereas we produced
hca vi by using a bacterial recombinant protein system. it is
likely that the post-traslational glycosylation reactions are
different between human and e. coli, which may thus explain
the very low enzymatic activity and insensitivity to acetazolamide inhibition observed in the study of the cited authors.12 it
should be also mentioned that the enzyme from the murakami
and sly12 report showed an unexplainably low catalytic activity
(as we mentioned above), which is reflected thereafter also in
its low affinity for these sulfonamide inhibitors.
but what is the significance of our results? as mentioned in
the introduction, the saliva secreted isozyme hca vi is the least
understood isoform of this large family of metalloproteins.
however, several important physiological studies demonstrated
its involvement in olfaction, taste, and ph regulation in the oral
cavity.10-15,36,37 our results show ca vi to possess a much
higher enzymatic activity for the co2 hydration reaction than
previously reported.12 in fact, ca vi has around 33% of the
enzymatic activity of hca ii, a very efficient catalyst for this
crucial physiologic reaction. furthermore, ca vi has the same
catalytic power as ca i, another very abundant and ubiquitous
ca isoform, but in contrast to ca i, which is generally less

386

susceptible to inhibition by sulfonamides (table 2),1-4 ca vi
has a good affinity for many such compounds, some of which
are widely used clinical drugs. thus, the metallic taste35
observed as a side effect after the treatment with systemic
sulfonamide cais may in fact be due to the inhibition of the
salivary ca vi. a possible solution to this unpleasant (but nonlife-threatening) side effect would be that of designing compounds without ca vi inhibitory properties that at the same
time inhibit the other targeted isoform(s), such as for example
ca ii and ca ix.
there is strong evidence from parkkila’s and kivela’s
laboratories36,37 showing that ca vi is present in the enamel
pellicle of the teeth. however, the same authors showed that
ca vi concentrations in the saliva did not correlate with salivary
ph or the buffer capacity of this fluid.36,37 thus, the prevalent
hypothesis up to now regarding the role of ca vi found in the
enamel/saliva was that it provides bicarbonate for the neutralization of acid produced by microbe-delivered h+ ions, in this way
protecting teeth from caries.36,37 however, tooth enamel,
similarly to bone, is formed of the same mineral matrix,
hydroxyapatite, and it is well-established that another ca
isoform, ca ii, is involved in bone homeostasis in osteoclasts.38
by catalyzing co2 hydration to bicarbonate and protons in
osteoclasts, ca ii provides h+ ions needed in the processes of
bone formation, resorption, and remodeling.38 furthermore, a
long-term treatment with acetazolamide, a potent ca ii inhibitor,
was shown to be one of the few effective treatments for the
prevention of osteoporosis.39 thus, our hypothesis regarding the
physiological role of ca vi is the alternative one to the parkkilakivela36,37 hypothesis mentioned above, i.e., that this enzyme
may be involved in the acidification of the enamel pellicle, by
catalyzing co2 hydration (resulted from the bacterial metabolism) to bicarbonate and protons and that its inhibition may be
thus useful in prevention of caries. the acid formed due to the
enzymatic activity of this isoform might be used for mobilization
of calcium from the mineral matrix, thus leading to the formation
of caries. thus, we suggest that ca vi may have the same
physiological role (in teeth) as ca ii in the bone resorption
processes operating in osteoclasts. in fact, we recently showed
that ca vi has a rather high sensitivity to inhibition by
bicarbonate, with a ki of 0.80 mm (whereas the ki of hca i is
12 mm, of hca ii is 85 mm, and of hca ix is 13 mm against
this anion).40 such data reveal that ca vi would not be
particularly active enzymatically in the presence of high amounts
of bicarbonate, and especially not so for the dehydration reaction
(bicarbonate conversion to carbon dioxide in the presence of
h+, a reaction that is much more rapidsand needs no catalysts
as compared to the reverse one, co2 hydration to bicarbonate).1
thus, similarly to other ca isozymes,1-4 we consider ca vi
to be more active as a catalyst for the hydration of carbon
dioxide to bicarbonate and a proton, eventually in the highly
acidic conditions present in some tissues where the enzyme is
found, such as the enamel or some epithelial surfaces of the
upper alimentary tract,36,37 and not as a catalyst for converting
bicarbonate to co2, since this reaction is spontaneous, very fast,
and needs no catalyst.
some of the compounds investigated in this study, such as
the clinically used derivatives  xxxd810xxx , mza, dza, brz, and slp
(which are low nanomolar ca vi inhibitors), might be used to
verify our hypothesis, i.e., whether inhibition of ca vi is
detrimental or useful for caries formation. if the second situation
is the true one, ca vi inhibitors might be used as additives in
some toothpastes for reducing the acidification produced by the

nishimori et al.

relevant co2 hydrase activity of salivary ca vi and reducing
in this way cariogenesis.
4. conclusions
the first hca vi inhibition study is presented here. the full
length enzyme has a high catalytic activity with the following
kinetic parameters at 20 °c and ph 7.5, for the co2 hydration
reaction: kcat ) 9.5 × 105 s-1, and kcat/km ) 9.8. 107 m-1 s-1.
thus, hca vi has a significant catalytic activity for the
physiological reaction, on the same order of magnitude as the
ubiquitous isoform ca i or the transmembrane, tumor-associated
isozyme ca ix. a series of sulfonamides and a sulfamate have
been tested for their interaction with this isozyme. simple
benzenesulfonamides were rather ineffective hca vi inhibitors,
with inhibition constants in the range of 1090-6680 nm,
whereas better inhibitors were detected among such derivatives
bearing 2- or 4-amino-, 4-aminomethyl-, or 4-hydroxymethyl
moieties or among halogenated sulfanilamides (ki values in the
range of 608-955 nm). the clinically used compounds acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ,  xxxd2058xxx ,  xxxd1872xxx ,
 xxxd1931xxx ,  xxxd367xxx , topiramate, sulpiride, and indisulam
showed effective hca vi inhibitory activity, with inhibition
constants in the range of 0.8-79 nm. the best inhibitors were
 xxxd367xxx  and sulpiride (ki values of 0.8-0.9 nm), the last
compound being also a ca vi-selective inhibitor. the metallic
taste reported as a side effect after the treatment with systemic
sulfonamide cais may in fact be due to the inhibition of the
salivary ca vi. some of the compounds investigated in this
study, such as the clinically used derivatives showing low
nanomolar ca vi inhibitory activity, might be used as additives
in toothpastes for reducing the acidification produced by the
relevant co2 hydrase activity of salivary ca vi, which leads
to the formation of protons and bicarbonate in the enamel
pellicle.
experimental section
chemistry. compounds 1, 2, 4-6, 11, 12, 18-20, 23, and  xxxd810xxx 
through slp are commercially available from sigma-aldrich,
except dza (a gift from merck), brz (a gift from alcon), and
tpm (which was extracted from topamax pills, from johnson &
johnson). derivatives 3,19 7-10,19 13-17,20 21,21 22,22 and 2423
were prepared as reported earlier by this group.
the gst-hca vi fusion protein. the cdna fragment
encoding the open reading frame of hca vi was amplified from
polya(+) rna obtained from human salivary gland (clontech, palo
alto, ca) by using a commercial rt-pcr kit (takara, kyoto,
japan) with adopter primers including eco ri and sal i recognition
sequences (italic in the following sequences, respectively): 5′cggaattcccatgagggccctggtgcttct-3′ and 5′-gcgtcgactcagttcaatgctcttct-3′. the pcr reaction was hotstarted with incubation for 5 min at 94 °c and consisted of 35 cycles
of 30 s at 94 °c, 30 s at 57 °c, and 90 s at 72 °c. the pcr products
were cleaved with eco ri and sal i, purified, and cloned in-frame
into the pgex-4t2 vector (amersham). the cdna sequence of
the hca vi insert included in the vector was reconfirmed by dna
sequencing. the constructs were then transfected into e. coli strain
bl21 for production of the gst-hca vi fusion protein, similarly
to the procedure already described for hca vb, ix, and xii.
following induction of the protein expression by addition of 1 mm
isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were harvested
and sonicated in pbs. the cell homogenate was incubated at room
temperature for 15 min and homogenized twice with a polytron
(brinkmann) for 30 s each at 4 °c. centrifugation at 30 000g for
30 min afforded the supernatant containing the soluble proteins.
the obtained supernatant was then applied to a prepacked glutathione sepharose 4b column (amersham). the column was
extensively washed with buffer, and then the gst-hca vi fusion

carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

protein was eluted with a buffer consisting of 5 mm reduced
glutathione in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0. finally, the gst part of
the fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin. the advantage of
this method is that hca vi is purified easily and the procedure is
quite simple. the obtained hca vi was further purified by
sulfonamide affinity chromatography,33 the amount of enzyme being
determined by spectrophotometric measurements and its activity
by stopped-flow experiments, with co2 as substrate.32
ca inhibition assay. an applied photophysics stopped-flow
instrument has been used for assaying the ca-catalyzed co2
hydration activity.32 phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mm) has
been used as indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of
557 nm, with 10 mm hepes (ph 7.5) as buffer and 0.1 m na2so4
(for maintaining constant the ionic strength), following the cacatalyzed co2 hydration reaction for a period of 10-100 s. the
co2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 17 mm for the determination
of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. for each inhibitor
at least six traces of the initial 5-10% of the reaction have been
used for determining the initial velocity. the uncatalyzed rates were
determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total
observed rates. stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mm) were prepared
in distilled-deionized water with 10-20% (v/v) dmso (which is
not inhibitory at these concentrations), and dilutions up to 0.01 nm
were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. inhibitor and
enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at room
temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the formation of
the e-i complex. the inhibition constants were obtained by
nonlinear least-squares methods using prism 3, from lineweaverburk plots, as reported earlier, and represent the mean from at least
three different determinations.
