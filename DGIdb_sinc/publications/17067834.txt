abstract
gabapentin is a drug that has been widely used in the treatment of chronic pain states. despite its widespread usage, it is only recently that
light has been shed on the mechanism of action of this agent. in the current review, the authors document the pharmacological, biochemical and
molecular information that has led to the identification of the ␣2␦1 auxilliary subunit of voltage gated calcium channels as the target for this drug’s
actions.

1. introduction
gabapentin (neurontin® , 1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanacetic
acid) is an intriguing drug; synthesized nearly 40 years ago the
original concept was to increase the lipophilicity of the inhibitory
neurotransmitter gaba (␥- xxxd2177xxx ) by addition of
a cyclohexyl substituent, thereby increasing its cns penetrating properties yet retaining a similar pharmacology. however,
over the next three decades, the elucidation of the mechanism of
action of this novel gaba analogue and a full appreciation of
its associated therapeutic profile has become a (at least minor)

classic in the history of drug discovery. previous reviews have
covered various aspects of the pharmacology of gabapentin and
related compounds from a clinical point of view [1,2], the intention of the current article is to present the work that has led to
the elucidation of ␣2␦ as the molecular target of this important
therapeutic and to summarise our understanding of the role of
this protein in the regulation of pain.
2. gabapentin as a gaba modulator
numerous studies suggest that gabapentin does not bind to
either gabaa or gabab receptors [3,4] nor is it converted
metabolically into gaba [5]. in vitro and at high concentration,
gabapentin is a mixed type inhibitor of gaba-transaminase
[6] and increases the activity of partially purified  xxxd2431xxx 
decarboxylase [7]. since in vivo nmr spectroscopic studies

have shown that gaba concentrations are elevated in human
patients taking gabapentin, and that this elevation of gaba is
related to seizure control [8,9], it is possible that these actions are
clinically significant although this requires further investigation.
studies based on the structural similarity between baclofen
(gabab agonist) and gabapentin, together with the overlapping
cns distribution of gabapentin binding with gabab receptors
[10,11] have suggested a possible direct action of gabapentin on
gabab receptors. however, other groups have been unable to
confirm these findings [12–14]. several groups have now also
compared the effects of gabab agonists and gabapentin in
animal models of pain. in all models tested to date the antihyperalgesic activity of gabapentin has not been reversed by the
co-administration of gabab antagonists suggesting that these
effects are not mediated via this mechanism [15–17]. together
with original binding data establishing the very low affinity
of gabapentin for the  xxxg828xxx  [4], these results suggest that the gabapentin effects are not directly mediated by
the  xxxg828xxx , or at least the mechanism of action of
gabapentin is quite different from that of other gabab agonists. so far, no tangible irrefutable evidence has been provided
for an action of gabapentin at the  xxxg828xxx .
another hypothesis that has gained some support is that
gabapentin may act to modulate gaba transporter function. the
 xxxg2143xxx  gaba transporter is a plasma membrane protein involved
in regulating synaptic levels of gaba. whitworth and quick
[18] have demonstrated that a 2 h pre-incubation of hippocampal cultures with gabapentin or the more potent gabapentinmimetic (sr)- xxxd3005xxx  produces a two-fold increase
in subsequent gaba uptake, which was concentration- and
time-dependent. this effect appears to arise from a redistribution of  xxxg2143xxx  protein from intracellular locations to the plasma
membrane. on the other hand, eckstein-ludwig et al. [19] have
shown gabapentin to inhibit the uptake of gaba. these findings
are further complicated by studies which argue that gabapentin’s
ability to block the cytosolic branch chain aminotransferase will
lead to enhanced levels of gaba by increased cytosolic presence of precursor (reviewed in sweatt et al. [20]).
gabapentin has also been shown capable of increasing gaba
levels via inhibition of gaba-transaminase [6], and activation
of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase [7]. however it is important
to note that the micromolar to millimolar concentrations of
gabapentin required to mediate these effects are greater than
those thought to arise clinically [21]. furthermore, there is no
report indicating that a modification in gaba levels resulting
from gabapentin action may have analgesic properties [22]. as
gaba-receptor antagonists do not attenuate the antinociceptive
effect of gabapentin in several animal pain models [23,15] it is
unlikely that the antinociceptive effect of gabapentin is mediated
through elevating gaba levels in the cns.

of this compound. initial radioligand binding analysis revealed
that gabapentin did not interact with a wide variety of commonly studied drug, neurotransmitter and ion channel binding
sites [24]. however, [3 h]gabapentin was shown to bind with
high affinity to a single population of binding sites present in
homogenised brain membranes from a variety of mammalian
species (kd in rat 38 nm; [4,25]). the ability of a large variety of neuroactive chemicals to displace [3 h] gabapentin from
these binding sites has been examined. of the wide range of
agents tested, the vast majority were inactive supporting the
idea that gabapentin interacts with a unique pharmacological
site [5]. however, potent and stereoselective displacement of
[3 h]gabapentin was achieved with large neutral amino acids
[25] and several 3-substituted analogues of gaba, most notably
the s isomer of  xxxd3005xxx  or pregabalin [4]. subsequent
autoradiographical studies have demonstrated that these binding
sites are heterogeneously expressed throughout the brain and are
probably located on neurons rather than glia [26] (fig. 1).
the [3 h]gabapentin binding protein was subsequently purified from pig brain and shown to be the ␣2␦ accessory subunit
of the voltage dependent calcium channel complex [27,28]. the
␣2␦ family consists of four genes; ␣2␦-1 was first identified from
skeletal muscle [29] and is now known to exist as five tissuespecific splice variants [30]. ␣2␦ proteins are synthesised as
pre-proteins that undergo extensive post-translational modifications. the membrane targeting signal is proteolytically removed
whilst further cleavage generates a small c-terminal fragment
(␦) that remains attached to the larger (␣2) fragment by a disulphide bridge. it is generally believed that the ␦ subunit forms
a single transmembrane spanning segment which anchors the
wholly extracellular ␣2 subunit to the calcium channel complex
(for review see ref. [31]). gabapentin binding appears to be
dependent on the presence of both ␣ and ␦ subunits since neither individual subunit appears capable of binding the drug when
expressed alone [32]. mutational analysis of ␣2␦-1 has led to
the identification of three important regions (206–222, 516–537

3. identiﬁcation of ␣2␦ as the high afﬁnity gabapentin
binding site
the lack of definitive evidence to support an interaction
between gabapentin and gaba receptors led researchers to consider other possibilities to account for the therapeutic effects

fig. 1. autoradiography of the rat brain (horizontal section) showing the binding
of [3 h]-gabapentin in various regions (from hill et al. [26]). gabapentin binding
is heterogeneously distributed throughout the brain with highest levels observed
in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. moderate binding is seen in the
thalamus and striatum.

and 583–603 within the ␣2 subunit) for gabapentin binding, with
the arginine residue at position 217 being critical to the binding
[32].
further evidence in favour of gabapentin’s action being mediated via the ␣2␦ protein has come from animal pharmacology
experiments in which it has been shown that the antihyperalgesic potency of gabapentin, pregabalin and the much weaker
r isomer of  xxxd3005xxx  correlate with their ␣2␦ binding
affinity [33]. in a more recent study belliotti et al. [34] have
analysed the anxiolytic activity of a larger range of pregabalin
analogues and have shown that due to their charged nature, the
bioavailability of many of these agents relies on the system l
amino acid transporter [35]. however, if one takes this into consideration it is possible to predict biological activity based on
affinity for ␣2␦ (see fig. 2 for further details).
over the last few years, the complexity of the field has
increased with the discovery of three novel ␣2␦ genes, ␣2␦-2
and ␣2␦-3 by klugbauer et al. [36] and ␣2␦-4 by qin et al. [37].
each subunit is widely expressed throughout the body in a tissue
specific manner [38,39]. interestingly, ␣2␦-2, but not ␣2␦-3 or
␣2␦-4, has been shown to bind gabapentin with a similar affinity
to that shown by ␣2␦-1 [40,37]. analysis of the gene structure of
␣2␦-2 and ␣2␦-3 proteins has revealed the presence of arginine
at position 217 in the ␣2␦-2 gene and its absence in the ␣2␦-

fig. 2. the correlation between the in vitro and in vivo activities for pregabalin
and related compounds is demonstrated in the three-dimensional plot of ␣2␦
binding affinity (x-axis), activity in the vogel conflict model of anxiety (y-axis)
and affinity from the system l transporter (z-axis). while the correlation of in
vitro activity with this in vivo effect is not perfectly linear possibly due to factors
such as differences in oral absorption or clearance rates, analogues that show
increased ␣2␦ binding affinity and system l inhibitory potency (toward the left
and back part of the grid) are associated with activity in the anxiety model.
taken together, these results suggest that the system l amino acid transporter is
required to allow these zwitterionic molecules to gain access to the cns. subsequent interaction of drug molecules with the ␣2␦ subunit of calcium channels is
required for the observed pharmacological activity of pregabalin. (taken from
belliotti et al. [34].)

3 gene, further underlining the importance of this residue in
gabapentin binding. recent studies performed on mice in which
the arginine present at position 217 of ␣2␦-1 has been mutated to
an alanine residue, has shown that although these mice are normal, they show a 2.5-fold decrease in pregabalin binding in the
brain and spinal cord and are resistant to pregabalin in models
of hyperalgesia (data presented by bramwell et al. [41]).
4. physiological role of ␣2␦
heterologous expression studies have shown that ␣2␦ is capable of modulating the activity of a wide range of calcium channel
␣1 subunits (reviewed in ref. [42]). co-expression of ␣2␦ with
various ␣ and ␤ subunits result in an increase in current density and dihydropyridine binding sites, acceleration of current
activation and inactivation and a hyperpolarising shift in the
current–voltage relationship. the mechanisms by which these
effects are mediated are as yet incompletely defined although the
increase in current density and dihydropyridine binding sites
can be explained by improved targeting to the cell membrane
[43]. an indication of the physiological importance of ␣2␦ proteins can be obtained from studies in mutant mice. the mutant
mouse ducky is a model for absence epilepsy and cerebellar
ataxia [44]. these mice display a reduced size, have abnormalities in the purkinje cell dendritic tree [45] and are not able to
breed or survive beyond day 35. recently, barclay et al. [46]
showed that mutations in ␣2␦-2 cause a reduction of calcium
current in purkinje cells that may underlie the phenotype. a
similar epileptic and ataxic phenotype has also been reported
in mutant mouse entla in which mutation of the ␣2␦-2 protein results in reduced calcium currents in purkinje cells and
gabapentin binding to cerebellar membranes [47]. similarly, the
importance of the ␣2␦-1 protein to normal physiology is underlined by the embryonic lethality of this knockout (authors own
observations).
despite the clear role ␣2␦ proteins apparently perform in
calcium channel function, it has proven problematic to demonstrate clear unequivocal effects of gabapentin on the activity of
these channels. in 1998, stefani et al. [48] were the first group
to demonstrate that gabapentin inhibited voltage-dependent calcium channel currents recorded from cortical neurons, in direct
contrast to shumacher et al. [49] who failed to detect any
gabapentin-mediated change in the calcium channel currents
recorded from hippocampal neurones taken from patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy. recent work using both electrophysiological and calcium imaging techniques has focussed on drg
neurons where it appears that gabapentin can exert more robust
effects [14,50–52]. these observations appear to correlate well
with other work performed in the hyperalgesic spinal cord and
entorhinal cortex which has shown that gabapentin can modulate
excitatory transmission via a presynaptic mechanism [53,54].
several independent studies have now shown that, given the
right conditions gabapentin can produce a reduction in calcium
influx in presynaptic nerve terminals and inhibit the release of
excitatory amino acids in a regionally selective manner [55,56].
recent data also describe an inhibitory effect of gabapentin on
k+ -stimulated [3 h]-noradrenaline release from human neocor-

568

y.p. maneuf et al. / seminars in cell & developmental biology 17 (2006) 565–570

tex [57], where this effect was reported to be katp channelmediated [58]. other early reports mentioning an inhibitory
effect of gabapentin on dopamine release in the rabbit striatum [59] and of 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in whole blood of
healthy young men [60] remain anecdotal and have not been
substantiated by further studies.
recent evidence also suggests that the effects of gabapentin
can be stimulus-dependent in certain systems. for example in
rat caudal trigeminal slices, gabapentin has no effect on the
k+ -evoked release of [3 h] glutamate but is able to inhibit the
facilitatory effects of  xxxg2240xxx  or calcitonin gene related
peptide on glutamate release [61]. gabapentin also inhibits the
enhancement of k+ -evoked [3 h] glutamate release by activators
of pkc or adenylate cyclase in these slices [62], suggesting that
it may act to modulate calcium influx following phosphorylation.
however, fehrenbacher et al. [63] were able to characterise an
inhibitory effect of gabapentin on the capsaicin-evoked release
of the sensory neuropeptides,  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) and calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp) from rat spinal cord slices in vitro.
although the release of peptides from non-inflamed animals was
not altered by either drug, prior in vivo treatment by intraplantar
injection of complete freund’s adjuvant enhanced the release
of both sp and cgrp from spinal tissues in vitro, which was
then attenuated by gabapentin and pregabalin. these drugs also
reduced release of sp and cgrp in spinal tissues pretreated
in vitro with the protein kinase c activator, phorbol 12,13dibutyrate. taken together, these studies suggest that gabapentin
and pregabalin modulate the release of sensory neuropeptides,
but only under sensitized states which are believed to play important roles in pain processing.
5. pathophysiological role of ␣2␦ in pain
there is now a wealth that suggests that in chronic pain states
the expression of ␣2␦ increases and that these changes correlate
with hyperalgesia. for example, it has been shown that ␣2␦1 expression is enhanced in sensory neurons [64,65] and spinal
dorsal horn [66] of neuropathic pain models and that this increase
in expression correlates with neuropathic pain development and
maintenance. since blocking injury-induced dorsal horn ␣2␦-1
expression by dorsal rhizotomy or intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide treatment reverses the neuropathic pain ([67], fig. 3),
it seems that increased ␣2␦-1 expression at presynaptic terminals from the drg contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic
pain states post-peripheral nerve injury. thus, modulation of
presynaptic functions associated with increased ␣2␦-1 and/or
calcium channels may form the molecular basis underlying the
antihyperalgesic properties of gabapentin in these pain states,
a mechanism similar to that derived from electrophysiological
and transmitter-release studies discussed previously. further evidence supporting the therapeutic relevance of the ␣2␦ binding
site in gabapentin action has been provided by luo et al. [68]
who demonstrated that antiallodynic effects of gabapentin were
observed only in models with significant spinal cord and/or dorsal root ganglion ␣2␦-1 subunit up-regulation.
direct evidence supporting a pathophysiological role of the
␣2␦-1 subunit in pain processing comes from a recent trans-

genic study. when the ␣2␦-1 protein is overly expressed in
neuronal tissues, including sensory and dorsal horn neurons, of
transgenic mouse lines, the ␣2␦-1 transgenic mice exhibit hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli compared with
wild type littermates [66]. the hypersensitivity observed in the
transgenic mice can be reversed by intrathecal gabapentin dosedependently, supporting that elevated ␣2␦-1 at the spinal level
contributes to the development/maintenance of abnormal sensations and underlies the antihyperalgesic actions of gabapentin
(li et al., personal communication).
6. conclusions and future directions in gabapentin
research
gabapentin is a drug which has shown utility in a wide range
of clinical disorders ranging from neuropathic pain to anxiety
disorders [69,70]. despite this broad pharmacological spectrum
of activity, gabapentin shows virtually no toxicity or drug–drug
interactions and in many ways represents what many would
consider an ideal drug. although the lack of toxicity can to
some extent be related to its pharmacokinetic profile, the mechanism by which gabapentin mediates its clinical activity also
contributes to this unique profile.
in the present review we present a large body of pharmacological, molecular, chemical and physiological data that supports
the hypothesis that gabapentin mediates it actions via interaction
with the ␣2␦ protein. furthermore, we present novel and emerging data that identifies the ␣2␦-1 protein as the site of action
of gabapentin in the treatment of pain. despite these findings
there remain a number of questions that need to be unravelled.
for example, we still do not understand the role these proteins
perform in the pathophysiology of pain, nor do we understand
precisely how gabapentin ameliorates these conditions through
interaction with the ␣2␦-1 protein.

in conclusion, the authors would like to draw the reader’s
attention to one important lesson that can be taken from these
studies. we believe that gabapentin is a drug which exemplifies
the importance of systems biology and clinical pharmacology
in drug discovery. using today’s conventional drug discovery
processes, gabapentin would simply never have gotten past its
first synthesis. the first experiment would have shown it to be
devoid of gabaergic activity and millions of patients would
never have obtained clinical benefit from this drug. fortunately
for us all, this molecule was synthesised over 30 years ago in
a time when pharmacologists were more prepared (and able)
to test agents in disease systems and to let the data drive them
forward regardless of preconceptions.
