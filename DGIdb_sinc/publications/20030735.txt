abstract

oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  are both used as nasal mucosa decongesting
a-adrenoceptor agonists during a common cold. however, it is largely unknown which
of the six a-adrenoceptor subtypes are actually present in human nasal mucosa,
which are activated by the two alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and to what extent.
therefore, mrna expression in human nasal mucosa of the six a-adrenoceptor
subtypes was studied. furthermore, the affinity and potency of the imidazolines
oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  at these a-adrenoceptor subtypes were examined
in transfected hek293 cells. the rank order of mrna levels of a-adrenoceptor
subtypes in human nasal mucosa was: a2a > a1a ‡ a2b > a1d ‡ a2c >> a1b. oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  exhibited in radioligand competition studies higher
affinities than the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline at most a-adrenoceptor subtypes. compared to  xxxd3539xxx , oxymetazoline exhibited a significantly
higher affinity at a1a- but a lower affinity at a2b-adrenoceptors. in functional studies
in which adrenoceptor-mediated ca2+ signals were measured, both, oxymetazoline
and  xxxd3539xxx  behaved at a2b-adrenoceptors as full agonists but oxymetazoline
was significantly more potent than  xxxd3539xxx . furthermore, oxymetazoline was
also a partial agonist at a1a-adrenoceptors; however, its potency was relatively low
and it was much lower than its affinity. the higher potency at a2b-adrenoceptors, i.e.
at receptors highly expressed at the mrna level in human nasal mucosa, could
eventually explain why in nasal decongestants oxymetazoline can be used in lower
concentrations than  xxxd3539xxx .

introduction
alpha-adrenoceptors are cell membrane receptors which
belong to the seven transmembrane spanning g-proteinlinked family of receptors. six genes for a-adrenoceptors
(a1a, a1b, a1d, a2a, a2b, and a2c) have been identified
and sequenced [1]. the a1-adrenoceptors couple via
gq/11 to phospholipase c, and activation of the receptors
results in the production of inositol triphosphate (ip3)
and diacyl glycerol and thereby in an increase of
intracellular ca2+ and activation of protein kinases such
as pkc [2]. the a2-adrenoceptors negatively couple via
gi/o to adenylate cyclase to decrease camp. activation of

a2a-adrenoceptors causes inhibition of neurotransmitter
release. nasal obstruction associated with acute or
allergic rhinitis is probably due to an increase in nasal
microvascular permeability as a consequence of the
dilatation of plexus cavernosum and mucosal congestion. the mucosal tissue located on nasal septum and
lateral as well as medial turbinate is highly vascularized.
in the superficial nasal mucosa, nasal blood flows
typically from arteries to capillaries and into veins at a
rate of about 40 ml/100 g of tissue per minute [3].
mucosal tissue contracts when exposed to sympathomimetic vasoconstrictors such as the standard topical
decongestant oxymetazoline, and the smooth muscles of

vasculature in nasal mucosa are believed to be the only
tissue that possesses contractility [4].
previous studies have shown that a2-adrenoceptors
are distributed in dog [5], pig [6] and human [7,8] nasal
mucosa and that a2-adrenoceptors mediate vasoconstriction in pig [6] and human [8] nasal mucosa.
radioligand binding studies using the a1-adrenoceptor
antagonist [3h] xxxd3000xxx  and the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist [3h]rauwolscine have demonstrated the expression
in the human nasal mucosa of both a2- and a1adrenoceptor protein [9]. however, these radioligands
cannot discriminate between adrenoceptor subtypes. in
addition, the involvement of the receptor subtypes in
vasoconstriction by oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  is
largely unknown. like the catecholamines noradrenaline and adrenaline both imidazolines are regarded as
nonselective a-adrenoceptor agonists [8]. only oxymetazoline has been shown to induce ca2+ responses
in cells heterologously expressing human a1a-adrenoceptors [10]. therefore, in the present study we examined the mrna expression of a-adrenoceptor subtypes in
human nasal mucosa and we investigated the receptor
affinity, potency and efficacy of the a-adrenoceptor
agonists oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  at the six
human a-adrenoceptor subtypes.

of the six a-adrenoceptors expressed in native hek293
cells as well as in cells transfected with the corresponding
cdna.

mrna expression of human alpha-adrenoceptors
in nasal mucosa
tissue collection
nasal mucosa was obtained from ten healthy persons,
i.e. patients that underwent turbinoplasty to improve
their nasal ventilation (six women; mean age of 39.83 ±
10.09 and four men; mean age of 34.00 ± 10.80). all
tissue samples were collected in the department of
otolaryngology at the university clinics of bonn. samples were stored at )80 c in 5 ml rnalater (qiagen,
hilden, germany) until use.

qpcr
for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qpcr) 35 ll of amplification mixture (quantitectsybrgreen kit; qiagen) was used containing 20 ng reverse
transcribed rna and 300 nm of the following primers
(sense/antisense):

reactions were run on an mx 3000p real-time cycler
(stratagene, amsterdam, the netherlands) using the
following cycling conditions: 15 min polymerase activation at 95 c and 45 cycles at 95 c for 30 s, at 58 c
for 30 s and at 72 c for 30 s. each assay included
negative controls and a standard curve for each gene.
the results were analysed using the stratagene software
(version mx 3000 pro) and the data were exported to
excel 2003 (microsoft) and prism 5.0 (graphpad, san
diego, ca, usa) for further analysis.
the identity of the pcr products was confirmed by
melt point analysis and by dideoxy chain termination
sequencing.
the relative mrna expression of each a-adrenoceptor
was calculated from the ratio a-receptor/ xxxg88xxx  (a2a)
within one sample of nasal mucosa. results are displayed
as log2- and fold-values.

rna isolation and reverse transcription
rna from nasal mucosa was isolated using the rneasy
tissue mini kit (qiagen) with dnase treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna quantity
was determined by spectrophotometry (uv-mini, shimadzu, kyoto, japan). total rna (2 lg per sample) was
reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (revertaid cdna synthesis kit; fermentas,
st leon-rot, germany) using random hexamer primers.
the same procedure was used to determine the mrnas

cdna of human alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes
the cdnas of the human a-adrenoceptor genes  xxxg85xxx   xxxg87xxx 
(a1a),  xxxg86xxx  (a1b),  xxxg88xxx  (a2a),  xxxg89xxx  (a2b)
and  xxxg90xxx  (a2c) were obtained from umr cdna
resource center (university of missouri-rolla, mo, usa).
all above mentioned cdnas were cloned into the vector
pcdna3.1(+) (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany). the
enzymes used for cloning into the multiple cloning site
of the vector were: ecori (5¢) and xhoi (3¢) for  xxxg85xxx   xxxg87xxx ,

and bamhi (5¢) and xhoi (3¢) for  xxxg90xxx . the cdna of
 xxxg85xxx   xxxg87xxx  (a1d) was obtained from origene (rockville,

at ecori (5¢)- and sali (3¢) sites.
all human a-adrenoceptor cdnas were analyzed for
correct nucleotide sequence (according to the reference
sequence given in the genbank at ncbi) by dideoxy
chain termination sequencing. in case of false nucleotides or deletions, the quik change mutagenesis kit
(stratagene) or insertion pcr were used to obtain the
correct sequence. site-directed mutagenesis was carried
out for  xxxg86xxx ,  xxxg85xxx   xxxg87xxx ,  xxxg88xxx  and  xxxg90xxx ;
insertion pcr reactions were used for  xxxg90xxx . the
final nucleotide sequences matched with the reference
gene sequences of the genbank at ncbi. the genbank
accession numbers are: ay389505 for  xxxg85xxx   xxxg87xxx ,

and  xxxg90xxx  for  xxxg90xxx .
cell culture and transfection
human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells (atcc,
manassas, va, usa) were seeded in either 75 cm2
(ca2+ measurements) or 175 cm2 (radioligand binding)
culture flasks in dmem/ham’s f12 (1/1) + 10% dialysed fetal calf serum (fcs) in order to obtain a cell
density of 40–70% for transient transfection the following day. transfection was performed by lipofection with
transit-293 transfection reagent (mirus bio, madison,
wi, usa). for radioligand binding assays cells were
exclusively transfected with cdnas coding for the
a-adrenoceptors. for ca2+ measurements using chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (cret) the
pg5a vector containing the cdnas for apoaequorin and
enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) [11] was
used. the cdna coding for the promiscuous human
ga16, which resembles the gq class of alpha subunits
[12–14], was cloned into the expression vector
pcdna3.1(+) (invitrogen, karlsruhe, germany). cells
were transfected with the pg5a vector, the a-adrenoceptor cdna and the ga16 cdna at a ratio of 2 : 1 : 1.
cells were used 48 h post transfection.
plasma membrane preparation and radioligand
binding assays
for radioligand binding experiments, plasma membranes
were prepared from transiently transfected hek293
cells. cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and
washed once with binding assay buffer (150 mm nacl,

731

1.8 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, and 5.4 mm
koh, ph 7.4). all steps were carried out on ice. after
resuspension of the cells in 2 ml binding assay buffer,
they were homogenized using an ultraturrax homogenizer, and cell debris were pelleted. the supernatant was
centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge. the resulting pellet
was washed once with binding assay buffer and centrifuged. the final pellet was resuspended in binding assay
buffer and homogenized by pipetting through a gauche
needle. protein measurement was carried out by the
method of lowry et al. [15] using bovine  xxxg124xxx 
as standard. for determination of kd and bmax values in
radioligand saturation binding studies, plasma membranes from hek293 cells transiently transfected with aadrenoceptor cdnas were incubated with increasing
concentrations of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  (in case of a1-adrenoceptors) or [3h]rx821002 (in case of a2-adrenoceptors).
experiments were carried-out in triplicates. non-specific
binding was determined in parallel experiments at cell
membranes of native (not transfected) hek293 cells.
for competition binding experiments, plasma membranes were incubated with [3h] xxxd3000xxx  or [3h]rx821002
with or without the drug under study (unlabeled
adrenaline, noradrenaline, oxymetazoline or  xxxd3539xxx ) for 60 min at room temperature. in case of
adrenaline and noradrenaline 1 mm  xxxd228xxx  was
added to the incubation solution to prevent oxidation.
all reactions were carried out in triplicates. specific
binding was determined as the fraction of [3h] xxxd3000xxx 
or [3h]rx821002 which could be displaced by 10 lm
 xxxd2914xxx  or 10 lm rauwolscine, respectively.
incubation mixes were filtered through polyethylene
imine (0.3%)-coated gf/b filters (whatman, kent, uk)
using a brandel cell harvester. radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (beckman coulter,
fullerton, ca, usa).
measurement of intracellular ca2+ responses
the measurement of intracellular ca2+ responses was
performed by using an aequorin-egfp fusion protein
according to the method of cret. the assay was done as
previously described [16]. in brief, harvested cells were
loaded with 5 lm coelenterazine h for 2.5 h at room
temperature. suspensions of cells in assay buffer containing (in mm) nacl 150, cacl2 1.8, kcl 5.4, hepes 10,
d-glucose 20 (ph 7.4) were used for luminometric
determination of intracellular ca2+ transients in 96-well
plates in a berthold centro lb 960 luminometer. in the
case of recording ca2+ responses induced by adrenaline
and noradrenaline, 1 mm  xxxd228xxx  was added. light

emission was recorded 5 s prior and 25–60 s upon
autoinjection of the agonist dissolved in assay buffer at a
sampling rate of 2 hz.
data analysis
peak values for the concentration-response curves in the
ca2+ assay were obtained by subtraction of baseline light
emission from the agonist-induced peak signal. responses
were normalized to the noradrenaline (300 lm)-induced
light emission. concentration-response curves, inhibition
curves and saturation binding curves as well as the
corresponding constants pec50, pic50, bmax and kd were
calculated by means of graphpad prism 5.0 (graphpad
software inc., san diego, ca, usa). statistical analysis
was performed with one-way anova followed by dunnett’s post test. differences were considered significant at
p < 0.05.

 xxxd2914xxx  hydrochloride, rauwolscine hydrochloride
and the ()) enantiomers of noradrenaline (())-norepinephrine (+)-bitartrate) and adrenaline (())-epinephrine
(+)-bitartrate) were obtained from sigma-aldrich (taufkirchen, germany). oxymetazoline hydrochloride and
 xxxd3539xxx  hydrochloride were gifts from merck
(darmstadt, germany). [3h] xxxd3000xxx  (specific activity:
85 ci/mmol) and [3h]rx821002 (specific activity:
70 ci/mmol) were from ge healthcare life sciences
(freiburg, germany). all other substances and chemicals

results
alpha-adrenoceptor expression in human nasal
mucosa
by means of qpcr of reverse transcribed mrnas we
examined for the first time the mrna expression of the
diverse a-adrenoceptor subtypes in human nasal mucosa
from healthy subjects of central european origin. from
the six receptor subtypes, the highest expression was
observed for the mrna of the  xxxg88xxx  gene (a2aadrenoceptor) whereas the mrna of the  xxxg86xxx 
gene (a1b-adrenoceptor) showed the lowest expression
(figure 1). the rank order of mrna expression of the
human a-adrenoceptors was: a2a > a1a ‡ a2b > a1d ‡
a2c >> a1b. this result may indicate that the highly
expressed a-adrenoceptors (a1a, a2a, and a2b) could be
the primary targets for the vasoconstricting nasal
decongestants oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx .

heterologous expression of human alphaadrenoceptors in hek293 cells
since translation of mrna into protein and especially
processing and trafficking of a receptor protein to the cell
surface might differ from gene to gene, the mrna
expression must not necessarily mirror the protein
expression of the corresponding receptor gene. therefore,
we determined mrna expression (by means of qpcr) as
well as receptor protein expression (by means of radioligand saturation binding) of the diverse adrenoceptors
after transfection of hek293 cells with the corresponding receptor cdnas. native hek293 cells expressed
extremely low levels of the six adrenoceptors which were
on the limit of being measurable. after transfection with
the corresponding adrenoceptor cdna the mrna content was about 40.000-fold above the endogenous levels.

receptor pharmacology of oxymetazoline

four of the six adrenoceptor mrnas showed similar
high expression levels whereas the mrna of the a1band a2c-adrenoceptor was expressed at a clearly (about
50-fold) lower level (data not shown).the bmax values of
radioligand binding to isolated membranes of transiently
transfected cells are a measure of the receptor density at
the cell surface. as shown in figure 2, the receptor
densities (bmax in fmol/mg protein) ranged from about
121 000 (a2a) to about 2400 (a1d) with the following ranking order: a2a > a2b > a1a ‡ a1b ‡ a2c > a1d
(table i). these results indicate that receptor protein
processing and trafficking to the cell membrane must be
different between the six a-adrenoceptors. however, it
should be noted that bmax values in membrane prepa-

the cell surface and that the radioligand binding data
measured in hek293 cell membranes may not mirror
the situation in the nasal mucosa.
the affinity constants (kd values) of  xxxd3000xxx  for the
three a1-adrenoceptors were relatively similar ranging
from 0.15 nm (at a1d-adrenoceptors) to 0.64 nm (at
a1a-adrenoceptors) (table i). the affinity of the a-adrenoceptor antagonist rx821002 to the three human
a2-adrenoceptors was between 2 and 5 nm (table i),
indicating that this ligand does not differentiate between
the a2-adrenoceptor subtypes.
affinities of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists for
human alpha-adrenoceptors
the imidazolines oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  and
the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline were
examined for their affinities at human a-adrenoceptor
subtypes expressed in transiently transfected hek293
cells. affinities were determined by drug-induced inhibition of specific binding of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  to a1-adrenoceptors and [3h]rx821002 to a2-adrenoceptors. as shown
in figure 3, all four examined a-adrenoceptor agonists
caused concentration-dependent inhibition of radioligand binding to all six a-adrenoceptor subtypes. the
affinities (ki values) of the four substances at the
a-adrenoceptor subtypes, however, were markedly different (figure 3, table ii); as a rule, the two catecholamines exhibited lower affinities compared to the two
imidazolines (table ii). at a1a-adrenoceptors oxymetazoline exhibited a significantly higher affinity than
 xxxd3539xxx  (figure 3, table ii), at a1b-, a1d-, a2aand a2c-adrenoceptors both imidazolines showed comparable affinities (figure 3, table ii), whereas at a2badrenoceptors  xxxd3539xxx  exhibited a significantly
higher affinity than oxymetazoline (table ii).
potencies and efficacies of alpha-adrenoceptor
agonists at human alpha-adrenoceptors
hek293 cells loaded with coelenterazine h and transiently transfected with the cdnas encoding apoaequorin together with egfp as well as a human
a-adrenoceptor and the promiscuous g-protein ga16
were used to measure a-adrenoceptor agonist-mediated
increase in cytosolic ca2+ ions and thereby a light signal
through aequorin-egfp-cret. in these cells, adrenaline
and noradrenaline induced concentration-dependent
ca2+ signals with about identical maximum values
(figure 4, table iii). only at a1b-adrenoceptors the maximum response was about 30% higher for adrenaline

than for noradrenaline. at a1-adrenoceptors, the ec50
values for adrenaline were lower than those for
noradrenaline whereas the contrary was observed at
a2-adrenoceptors (table iii), indicating higher potency of
adrenaline and noradrenaline at a1- and a2-adrenoceptors, respectively. all ec50 values were in the low
micromolar range (table iii).
the imidazolines behaved different from the catecholamines since at most a-adrenoceptors (except a1a- and
a2b-adrenoceptors) increasing agonist concentration
caused no increased ca2+ signal (figure 4). at a2badrenoceptors,  xxxd3539xxx  and oxymetazoline produced pronounced and concentration-dependent ca2+
signals, and the maximum response was even 30%
above that of the catecholamines (table iii). at a1aadrenoceptors  xxxd3539xxx  showed no measurable

activity whereas oxymetazoline behaved as partial agonist with about 50% efficacy compared to noradrenaline
(table iii). the ec50 values of the imidazolines were
between 10 and 100 lm (table iii).
discussion
one aim of the present study was to identify the
a-adrenoceptor subtypes expressed in human nasal
mucosa. we could show for the first time that among
the a1-adrenoceptor mrnas the a1a-subtype and among
the a2-adrenoceptor mrnas the a2a- and the a2badrenoceptor mrna are most abundantly expressed.
these three adrenoceptors are also expressed as mrna
and as plasma membrane protein of hek293 cells at a
much higher density compared to e.g. a2c-adrenoceptors

transiently transfected with equal amounts of the
corresponding receptor cdnas. these results may indicate that the a1a-, a2a- and/or a2b-adrenoceptors may
play a major role in vasoconstriction of the human nasal
mucosa, and that these receptors could be the primary
targets for the vasoconstricting nasal decongestants
oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx . however, a2a-

adrenoceptors are typically expressed as presynaptic
autoreceptors on sympathetic nerve endings where their
activation induces inhibition of noradrenaline release
through e.g. inhibition of voltage-gated ca2+ channels
and/or activation of ca2+ -dependent k+ channels [17–
19]. the observed targeting of a2a-adrenoceptors to
nerve terminals in differentiated neuronal cells (pc12) is
in line with the putative physiological role of this

receptor subtype as a presynaptic autoreceptor [20]. in
addition, a predominant presynaptic localization of a2aadrenoceptors has also been demonstrated in a-adrenoceptor knock-out mice (for review see [21]). this seems
to indicate that among the more strongly expressed
receptors (respectively their mrnas) presumably a1aand a2b-adrenoceptors may play the most important role
in vasoconstriction of human nasal mucosa. although
a2a-adrenoceptor mrna shows the highest expression
in human nasal mucosa, nothing is known about the
physiological role of this receptor in this tissue; according
to our results this receptor is not involved in imidazolineinduced ca2+ responses. interestingly, in an overview on
adrenoceptor pharmacology, the a2b-adrenoceptor was
reported to represent the only a2-adrenoceptor which
physiologically is involved in vasoconstriction [22].
however, we cannot exclude that an involvement of
a2a-adrenoceptors in imidazoline-mediated vasoconstriction in nasal mucosa could be indirect. both imidazolines
could be high potency inhibitors for these receptors and
so prevent autoinhibition of presynaptic noradrenaline
release.
the level of mrna expression must not necessarily
mirror the level of protein expression of a membrane
receptor since processing and trafficking of the translation product may vary between different receptors.
although the amount of adrenoceptor cdna used for
transient transfection of hek293 cells was identical for
all adrenoceptors, the density (bmax) of the a2c- and a1dreceptor protein expressed in the plasma membrane was
by a factor of 7.3 and 51, respectively, lower than that of

the a2a-adrenoceptor which was expressed with the
highest density (see table i). however, measurement of
a-adrenoceptor mrna expression of transfected cells
showed that the mrna levels were of similar height for
the a1a-, a2a-, a2b and a1d-adrenoceptors but they were
much lower for the mrna of a1b- and a2c-adrenoceptors. these results indicate that there were discrepancies
between mrna and receptor protein expression and the
highest discrepancy was observed for the a1d-adrenoceptor. thus, there are obviously clear differences in
translation and/or trafficking and processing of adrenoceptor subtypes, indicating that regulation of these
receptors may not only occur at the transcriptional level
but also post-transcriptionally and/or post-translationally. a very low membrane expression and predominant
intracellular localization of a1d-receptors in transfected
hek293 cells has already been observed in a previous
study [23]; the non properly processing of this receptor is
obviously a consequence of the lack of receptor glycosylation in this cell line. furthermore, in transfected
neuronal cells (pc12) a2c-adrenoceptor protein has also
been observed to be mostly located in an intracellular
compartment [20]. however, since this receptor also
showed low mrna expression in transfected cells, less
efficient transcription may also contribute to its low
membrane expression. functionally, there are further
components which contribute to diversities between
adrenoceptors, since even if a-adrenoceptor subtypes are
expressed at comparable densities in the cell membrane
of transfected cells, they can cause different efficacies of
the natural a-adrenoceptor agonist noradrenaline due to

differences in receptor coupling [24]. taken together,
these potential diversities as well as the above mentioned
differences between mrna and receptor protein
expression in hek293 cells which may be different in
the human nasal mucosa indicate that the a-adrenoceptor mrna densities measured in the human nasal
mucosa must not necessarily mirrow their height of
receptor protein expression nor their physiological
importance.
a further aim of this study was to explore the
interaction of two catecholamine agonists (noradrenaline and adrenaline) and two imidazoline agonists
(oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx ) at human a-adrenoceptor subtypes heterologously expressed in hek293
cells. these agonists have not yet been examined before
within one study and at all human a-adrenoceptor
subtypes. the affinities (ki values) were determined from
the ic50 values of agonist-induced inhibition of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  binding to a1-adrenoceptors and [3h]rx821002
binding to a2-adrenoceptors expressed in the plasma
membrane of the transiently transfected cells. the
affinities of the four a-adrenoceptor agonists at the six
adrenoceptor subtypes measured in radioligand binding
experiments were different between catecholamines and
imidazolines. as a rule, the two catecholamines, noradrenaline and adrenaline, exhibited lower affinities
(ki values between 0.2 and 93 lm) compared to the two
imidazolines, oxymetazoline and  xxxd3539xxx  (ki values between 0.01 and 5.5 lm). the affinities for the two
catecholamines were nearly identical and the rank order
of affinities was: a1d > a1b = a1a ‡ a2b ‡ a2c > a2a.
the rank order for the two imidazolines also was almost
identical; for oxymetazoline it was: a1a > a2a > a2c > a1b ‡ a1d > a2b. at a2b-adrenoceptors  xxxd3539xxx  exhibited a nearly three-fold higher affinity than
oxymetazoline, whereas at a1a-adrenoceptors oxymetazoline showed an about five-fold higher affinity than
 xxxd3539xxx . these differences between the affinities
of the two imidazolines to the respective receptor
subtypes were significant and most pronounced at the
a1a-adrenoceptors. presently, we have no explanation
for this result.
since affinity data give no information whether a
substance is an agonist (full or partial) or an antagonist,
we examined the four a-adrenoceptor agonists for their
agonistic potency at the six a-adrenoceptor subtypes
transiently expressed in hek293 cells. to enable the
measurement of receptor-induced activation of phospholipase c (plc) and the subsequent ip3-induced increases
in intracellular ca2+ ion concentration, hek293 cells

737

were transfected with the a-adrenoceptor subtype cdna
together with the ga16 cdna. it is known that, unlike
other members of the gq family of g-proteins, the ga16
protein can promiscuously couple g-protein coupled
receptors (gpcrs) and mediate agonist-induced stimulation of plc [12–14,25]. thus, this co-transfection
allowed the measurement of receptor-mediated calcium
signals independent from eventually preferred coupling
to other endogenously expressed g-proteins. since
hek293 cells do not express endogenous voltage-sensitive calcium channels [16], the agonist-induced calcium
signal should be exclusively due to ca2+ released from
intracellular stores.
the two catecholamine agonists noradrenaline and
adrenaline led to concentration-dependent increases in
intracellular ca2+ at all six a-adrenoceptor subtypes. the
ec50 values (potencies) were in the low micromolar
range. the low potency of the catecholamines at
a-adrenoceptors agrees with their contractile potency
in the human nasal mucosa [8,26]. the ec50 values at
hek293 cells, however, are higher than those reported
in the literature for, e.g. noradrenaline at a1- and a2adrenoceptor subtypes heterologously expressed in either
stably transfected chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells
[10,27,28] or in transiently transfected sf9 insect cells
[29]. however, the potency of noradrenaline (ec50 of
1.6 lm) at the embryonic rat aorta smooth muscle cell
line a7r5 stably transfected with the cdna of the
human a2b-adrenoceptor [30] agrees with our data.
only in a2b-adrenoceptor expressing hek293 cells the
imidazoline  xxxd3539xxx  caused a concentrationdependent ca2+ response; this response was characterized by a very low potency (ec50 about 100 lm) but a
high maximum. this result cannot be compared with
data in the literature since almost nothing is known
about the pharmacology of  xxxd3539xxx  at native or
heterologously expressed a-adrenoceptors. oxymetazoline behaved as a full agonist at a2b-adrenoceptors, too,
which are (at the mrna level) the third highest
expressed a-receptors in the human nasal mucosa. at
this receptor, oxymetazoline exhibited the same high
efficacy (about 120%) as  xxxd3539xxx , but it was
about seven-fold more potent (ec50 about 15 lm) than
 xxxd3539xxx . it should be noted that there was a
discrepancy between the potency and affinity values for
these two agonists at this receptor. while oxymetazoline
showed a 2.7-fold lower potency than affinity, the
potency of  xxxd3539xxx  was by a factor of 59 lower
than its affinity. nevertheless, the ic50 and ec50 values
of oxymetazoline for the a2b-adrenoceptor are quite

close. this fact indicates the possibility of a faster binding
process and onset of action compared to  xxxd3539xxx .
the latter point could be examined in future kinetic
studies.
oxymetazoline (but not  xxxd3539xxx ) showed partial agonistic activity (with ec50 values of about 11 lm
and emax values of about 50%) at human a1a-adrenoceptors which are the second highest expressed
a-adrenoceptors (at the mrna level) in the human
nasal mucosa. however, at this receptor oxymetazoline’s
potency was nearly 1000-fold lower than its affinity.
there are several potential reasons for differences
between binding and functional results such as differences in buffer composition, absence of gtp in binding
studies, duration of the experiment (long lasting equilibrium binding versus very short and transient ca2+
signaling). however, presently we have no clear-cut
explanation for the observed pronounced discrepancies
which remain to be examined in future studies.
partial agonistic activity of oxymetazoline at a1aadrenoceptors has also been shown in other cell systems
such as stably tranfected cho cells [10,27], and this was
also observed at a2c-adrenoceptors [28]. very low or not
correctly measurable agonistic activity of oxymetazoline
has been observed by others in transfected cho cells
expressing a1d- [10,27] or a2a-adrenoceptors [31]. in
the present study at hek293 cells agonistic activities of
the two imidazolines were very low and not correctly
measurable at a1b-, a1d-, a2a- and a1c-adrenoceptors. to
our knowledge, this is the first study in which affinities
and potencies of the two catecholamines, noradrenaline
and adrenaline, and of the two imidazolines,  xxxd3539xxx  and oxymetazoline, simultaneously have been
studied in transiently transfected hek293 cells. the fact
that the imidazolines showed no agonist activitiy at
some alpha-adrenoceptors together with the observed
discrepancies between potencies and affinities at some
a-adrenoceptors may eventually indicate that ca2+
signaling through a-adrenoceptors heterologously
expressed in hek293 cells may in some aspects differ
from a-adrenoceptor-mediated signal transduction in
smooth muscle cells.
in conclusion, we could show that human nasal
mucosa expresses at mrna level all six a-adrenoceptor
subtypes but only a1a-, a2a- and a2b-adrenoceptors are
expressed at high levels. among the imidazolines,
 xxxd3539xxx  exhibited full agonist properties only at
a2b-adrenoceptors whereas oxymetazoline was a more
potent and full agonist at a2b- and additionally a weak
partial agonist at a1a-adrenoceptors.
