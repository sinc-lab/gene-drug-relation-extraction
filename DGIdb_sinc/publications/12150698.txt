6. conclusion and expert opinion

 xxxd3302xxx  is a selective partial agonist acting on serotonergic type 4 receptors ( xxxg1117xxx ). pharmacodynamic studies indicate that  xxxd3302xxx  is able to stimulate gut propulsion and secretion with a net prokinetic effect. in contrast to
other  xxxg1117xxx  agonists endowed with a complex pharmacological profile,
 xxxd3302xxx  has a reliable prokinetic activity in the colon. clinical trials show
that  xxxd3302xxx  is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with irritable
bowel syndrome. in particular,  xxxd3302xxx  relieves symptoms of abdominal
pain, discomfort, abdominal bloating and constipation.

introduction

irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a functional gi disorder characterised by episodes
of symptoms referring to the large bowel in the absence of organic disease that readily explains them. ibs is compounded by a cluster of symptoms, including abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating and disordered bowel habits [1]. the
pathophysiology of ibs is incompletely understood but several mechanisms may
contribute to the symptoms. these include abnormal colonic or small intestinal
motility and transit, increased gut sensitivity, psychological and social factors, several
intraluminal factors and abnormalities of certain gi hormones [1]. however, each of
these mechanisms is only present in a subset of ibs patients and symptom pattern
and severity are likely to be determined by many factors [2].
the prevalence of ibs in the community is ∼ 10 – 20%, with an incidence of 1 –
2% per annum, and ibs patients constitute ∼ 28% of all patients seen by gastroenterologists in western countries [3,4]. no diagnostic markers for ibs exist, so diagnosis rests on the recognition of characteristic symptom patterns and the exclusion of
organic disease. similarly, there are no biological markers of disease severity, which
can only be assessed by the reporting of symptom severity. in an attempt to help clinicians investigate and manage ibs, a working team proposed diagnostic criteria for
ibs (box 1) [1]. considering the type of alteration in stool pattern that is associated
with pain or discomfort, different subgroups of ibs patients may be recognised [5].
in large population-based studies, ibs patients suffer from abdominal pain or discomfort, associated with predominant diarrhoea, constipation or alternating bowel
function, each present in ∼ 30% of the patients, while the remaining patients report
pain or discomfort without specific alteration of bowel function [6,7].
this subclassification seems most useful from a therapeutic point of view. in
fact, in the absence of a unifying pathophysiological target for the treatment of
ibs, therapy has traditionally focused on the predominant symptoms [8,9]. thus
loperamide is currently used in the treatment of ibs-associated diarrhoea, fibre and
osmotic laxatives are used for the treatment of ibs-associated constipation, and
anticholinergic agents, calcium channel blockers or smooth muscle relaxants are
used for the treatment of ibs-associated pain. as a second-line therapy, low doses

2.1 chemical

of antidepressants have been used to obtain relief from
abdominal pain and diarrhoea (not only in patients with psychiatric comorbidity) [8,9]. however, few studies have really
addressed these older therapies for ibs, which seem to have
only limited efficacy and are not free of side effects. fibre
often results in aggravation of bloating, tricyclic antidepressants tend to worsen constipation and laxatives relieve constipation but do not alleviate abdominal pain. while
antispasmodic and anticholinergic agents may have some
efficacy when used on an as-needed basis, they tend to
become less effective with long-term use [8,9].
there has recently been a surge of interest in compounds
acting on serotonergic (5-ht) receptors. seven types of 5ht receptors have been recognised and they have been
termed 5-ht1-7 [10,11]. 5-ht1-4 are expressed in the gi tract
and are involved in many gi functions [10,11]. 5-ht3 and 5ht4 receptors in particular have been shown to regulate
motor, sensory and secretory gut responses to intraluminal
stimuli [10,14]. compounds acting on these receptors have
been evaluated for the treatment of ibs and some of these are
now in the late phases of development. alosetron
(lotronex™, glaxosmithkline; 5-ht3 antagonist) was
withdrawn because of the risk of gi damage from ischaemic
colitis and complications of severe constipation but was
recently approved for limited use in severe ibs with diarrhoea.  xxxd1692xxx ™ (solvay pharmaceuticals inc.; 5-ht3
antagonist) is under investigation for diarrhoea-predominant
ibs.  xxxd3039xxx  ( xxxd3039xxx ™, jannsen pharmaceuticals) and
 xxxd3302xxx  ( xxxd3302xxx ™, novartis;  xxxg1117xxx  agonists) are under
investigation for treating constipation or constipation-predominant ibs patients. finally,  xxxd3097xxx  (glaxosmithkline; mixed 5-ht3 antagonist and  xxxg1117xxx  agonist) is under
investigation in alternating ibs. this review focuses on the
mechanism of action, efficacy and safety profile of  xxxd3302xxx .
1212

class
 xxxd3302xxx  is an indole carboxaldehyde derivative with the
chemical structure 3-[5-methoxy-1h-indole-3-ylmethylene]n-pentylcarbazimidamide hydrogen maleate (figure 1) that
acts as a selective agonist at the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor. the affinity
of  xxxd3302xxx  for the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor is ∼ 21% of that of serotonin, while it has negligible affinity for other serotonin receptors and no affinity for muscarinic, histamine 1, adrenergic
(alpha1 and 2), dopaminergic (d1 and 2) and opioid receptors [15].

2.2  xxxg1117xxx  receptors

 xxxd3302xxx  is a selective agonist at  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. in the central nervous system (cns) these receptors modulate dopamine
release and have direct role in cognition and memory [16]. 5ht4 receptors are also expressed in the heart where they have a
positive chronotropic effect [16]. in the adrenal cortex, activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors transiently stimulates aldosterone
secretion [17]. in the urinary bladder, activation of these receptors increases detrusor tone [18,19]. in the gut wall  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are mainly expressed on intrinsic primary afferent
neurons, where their activation triggers the peristaltic reflex
[20]. in addition, excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons,
enterocytes, secretory motor neurons and smooth muscle cells
may also express  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (figure 2) [14]. overall, activation of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors stimulates gi secretion and the peristaltic reflex, leading to a net prokinetic effect [10-14].
previous studies of the treatment of colonic motor disorders with the mixed 5-ht3 antagonist/ xxxg1117xxx  agonist  xxxd1708xxx  have generally shown low efficacy [21-23]. this might be
related to the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonistic properties of  xxxd1708xxx , which cause the inhibition of colonic propulsion
[24,25]. both in vitro and in vivo studies have established the
stimulatory effect of  xxxd3302xxx  on colonic motor activity.

nal  xxxd3302xxx  increased the velocity of propulsion of artificial
faecal pellets through the stimulation of the same receptors
[26]. in rat distal colon, intraluminal  xxxd3302xxx  stimulated 5ht4 receptors on colonocytes to secrete chloride and water
through an adenylyl cyclase-dependent pathway [27]. finally
the application of  xxxd3302xxx  on the circular muscle layer
induced a relaxation of the rectum through a direct effect on
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors located on the smooth muscle cells [28].
these experiments have also established that  xxxd3302xxx  is
more potent than endogenous serotonin and other commercially-available drugs with  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist activity,
such as  xxxd1708xxx , in stimulating the peristaltic reflex. this is
mainly as a consequence of its selective action on  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and of the lack of antagonist action at 5-ht3 receptors
which normally decreases peristalsis. moreover, the efficacy of
 xxxd3302xxx  does not follow a classical dose-dependent response.
the dose-response curve is biphasic, with most activity (measured as a decrease in total colonic transit time) at 5 mg b.i.d.
 xxxd3302xxx  and no effect at 1 or 100 mg b.i.d.  xxxd3302xxx  [29].
3.2 in vivo

studies in animals

3.2.1 motility

in vivo studies have amplified the results of in vitro studies
showing that  xxxd3302xxx  is effective at enhancing the motility
of the entire gi tract and decreasing the gastric and colonic
transit time. in a study in dogs  xxxd3302xxx  0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg i.v.
increased the motility of the antrum, duodenum and jejunum
in both fasting and fed conditions [30]. in a model of delayed
gastric emptying, the same doses of  xxxd3302xxx  restored normal
gastric transit time [30].  xxxd3302xxx  0.3 mg/kg in rats was able
to increase gastric and small bowel motility while in a model
of postoperative ileus it was able to restore gastric motility and
to increase the frequency of phase iii activity [31,32].  xxxd3302xxx 
0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg i.v. in dogs activated prolonged
colonic contractions, increasing the transit of a radioactive
tracer instilled immediately before the medication into the

proximal colon [33]. finally, in another study the delayed
colonic transit induced by the  xxxg831xxx  adrenergic agonist lidamidine was returned to normal by  xxxd3302xxx  [15].
3.2.2 sensory
in animal studies, isobaric distention of the viscera by means
of an intraluminal balloon is an established model for assessing the antinociceptive actions of different drugs. during distension of the stomach and colorectum the occurrence
respectively of a typical posture with contractions of neck
muscles and muscles in the abdominal wall are considered to
be indicative of noxious stimuli. in rats the administration of
0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg did not change the pain threshold to gastric distention [34]. in contrast, during colorectal distention
studies, increasing the distending pressure with 15 mmhg
every 5 min, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg of  xxxd3302xxx  reduced the
number of abdominal contractions at the lowest pressure of
distension (15 mmhg) without affecting colorectal volume.
moreover, 1 mg/kg  xxxd3302xxx  decreased the frequency of contractions at intermediate pressures (30 – 45 mmhg) and
increased the colorectal volume at low pressure [34]. similarly,
in cats, recordings from single afferent units in the dorsal root
ganglia at s2 established that incremental doses (0.15 – 1.2
mg/kg) of  xxxd3302xxx  dose-dependently inhibited the firing of
rectal afferent neurons induced by isobaric rectal distention
without altering rectal compliance [35].
the mechanism involved in this antinociceptive activity of
 xxxd3302xxx  is unclear. however, the lack of an altered motor
response to distention and the disappearance of the response
in the presence of a  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist suggest that  xxxd3302xxx 
acts at the level of a receptor located on afferent pathways.

els of the gi tract was studied in healthy volunteers. in a placebo-controlled study,  xxxd3302xxx  1.2 mg i.v. and 12 mg p.o.
for 4 days were shown to enhance gastric emptying and speed
small bowel and colonic transit time in healthy males [36]. in
the same way, appel et al. demonstrated that the administration of  xxxd3302xxx  for 7 days decreased the colonic transit time
in healthy subjects under both normal conditions and in a
model of delayed colonic transit [36,37].
a placebo-controlled study in a group of healthy volunteers
showed that 12 mg  xxxd3302xxx  was able to decrease the early
postprandial increase in colonic tone and to prolong the late
postprandial increase in colonic tone [38].
only one study of  xxxd3302xxx  in ibs is available, using lowdose  xxxd3302xxx . in this placebo-controlled study, prather et al.
showed that 4 mg/day  xxxd3302xxx  for 1 week significantly accelerated small bowel transit time in a group of constipation-predominant ibs patients without significantly modifying the
gastric emptying time [39]. at 48 h,  xxxd3302xxx  also enhanced
emptying of the proximal colon compared to baseline,
although the effect was not significant against placebo [39].
3.3.2 sensory

only one study has been published as an abstract on the effect
of  xxxd3302xxx  on rectal sensitivity in man.  xxxd3302xxx  6 mg b.i.d.
decreases sensitivity to rectal distension in healthy female subjects and therefore may have an antinociceptive effect [40].
4.

pharmacokinetics

4.1 metabolism

the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of
 xxxd3302xxx  have been investigated in several species (rat, mouse,
rabbit and dog). in humans, pharmacokinetic analysis reveals
that  xxxd3302xxx  is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. absolute bioavailability is 11 ± 3% [41] and is decreased
by 50% under fed conditions [41,42]. the time to reach peak
plasma concentration ranges from 1 – 1.3 h [41]. steady-state
concentrations of  xxxd3302xxx  are reached by day 8 [41], with
steady-state plasma levels of 0.7 – 5.6 µg/l [43] and a distribution volume of 368 ± 223 l [41]. in the bloodstream,  xxxd3302xxx 
is predominantly bound by alpha1-glycoprotein and does not
cross the blood–brain barrier to any significant extent.  xxxd3302xxx  undergoes two pathways of degradation. the major pathway involves gastric acid hydrolysis followed by oxidation and
glucuronidation. the secondary pathway involves direct glucuronidation in the liver. the main metabolite is a glucuronide which has negligible affinity for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors and no
effects on gi motor activity [30]. approximately two-thirds of
 xxxd3302xxx  and its metabolites are excreted unchanged in the
faeces, whereas the remaining third is excreted in the urine.
the terminal elimination half time is 11 ± 5 h [41]. these
pharmacokinetics characteristics support twice-daily dosing,
with doses taken before a meal. the short time to peak plasma
concentration (tmax) supports the observed early onset of
action and the fact that  xxxd3302xxx  does not appreciably cross
1214

the blood–brain barrier implies that effects in the cns should
be rare. in addition,  xxxd3302xxx  may act locally in the bowel
and therefore it may be relevant that a large proportion is
excreted unchanged in faeces.
age and gender do not influence the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3302xxx  [44]. dose adjustments do not appear to be necessary
for patients taking histamine receptor-2 blockers or proton
pump inhibitors, although plasma  xxxd3302xxx  concentrations
are influenced by stomach ph [45,46]. preliminary data suggest
that dose adjustments are not needed for patients with liver
cirrhosis or mild-to-moderate renal impairment [47,48].
4.2 safety features
the preclinical safety studies have shown that  xxxd3302xxx  has
the potential for good tolerability. an important aspect of
 xxxd3302xxx  is its lack of the side effects in the cardiovascular system that have been associated with other benzamide prokinetics acting on serotonin receptors, such as  xxxd1708xxx . in the
isolated rabbit heart model, drici et al. demonstrated that qt
intervals remained unchanged even with doses of  xxxd3302xxx 
500 – 5000 times the normal serum level [49]. the reason for
the different behaviour of  xxxd3302xxx  in comparison to  xxxd1708xxx  does not result from action on the  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in
human atria and ventricles but seems to reside in the low
potential of  xxxd3302xxx  to inhibit the delayed rectifier potassium current in cardiac myocytes [49]. specifically, the inhibition of the potassium current appears at a 50% inhibitory
concentration of 44 nm with  xxxd1708xxx  and at 13 µm with
 xxxd3302xxx . similarly, qt prolongation in the langendorff
model in isolated rabbit heart occurs with 100 nm of  xxxd1708xxx 
and > 10 µm of  xxxd3302xxx  [49]. it therefore requires very high
concentrations (500 – 5000 times those typically found in
human plasma after administration of recommended clinical
dosages) to affect the qt interval, indicating that  xxxd3302xxx  is
unlikely to cause qt prolongation in clinical use.
 xxxd3302xxx  was found to have no mutagenic or clastogenic
potential and does not induce dna damage [50]. toxicology
studies in animals show no relevant effects on reproductive or
hormonal functions or embryonic or neonatal development
[50]. however, radiolabelled studies show that radioactivity is
about three times higher in milk than in plasma of pregnant
women suggesting caution in the administration during
breastfeeding [50].
4.3 drug interactions

in vitro,  xxxd3302xxx  inhibits cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2c8,
2c9, 2c19,  xxxd851xxx  and (to a small extent) 3a, while it inhibits
cyp 1a2 and 2d6 somewhat more effectively but with ki
values still considerably more than clinically relevant doses (ki
0.84 µm for cyp 1a2 and 0.85 µm for cyp 2d6) [46]. however, no significant drug-to-drug interactions have been
observed with theophylline (cyp 1a2) [51] or dextromethorphan (cyp 2d6) [52] or with warfarin (cyp 2c9) [53] in vivo
with other cyp substrates in vitro [46]. in addition,  xxxd3302xxx 
does not affect the metabolism of digoxin [54] and does not

expert opin. pharmacother. (2002) 3(8)

seem to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in
healthy females [55]. finally, inhibitors of the liver cyp system
(such as the azole antifungals, antibiotics and antiviral agents)
are not expected to affect the metabolism of the drug as consequence of the minor role played by the oxidative system in
the degradation of  xxxd3302xxx  [46].
5. clinical

efficacy

considering the pharmacodynamic profile in healthy subjects,
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  has principally been investigated in patients with constipation-predominant ibs. at
present only one study has been published as a full paper [56]
but data from other studies seem to confirm the results [57-63].
in a placebo-controlled study [56], 881 patients with ibs
characterised by abdominal pain, bloating and constipation
received  xxxd3302xxx  or placebo for 12 weeks. the study followed a 4-week treatment-free baseline period followed by a
period in which the patients were randomised to receive
 xxxd3302xxx  4 or 12 mg/day or placebo. given the multi-symptom nature of ibs, assessing global end points which take
diagnostic symptoms into account is recommended for treatment evaluation in ibs trials [64]. the study evaluated the
subject’s global assessment (sga) of relief and abdominal
pain or discomfort during the treatment. patients treated
with  xxxd3302xxx  experienced greater relief of their overall ibs
symptoms and of abdominal pain or discomfort compared
with those treated with placebo. the difference in response
rate between  xxxd3302xxx  and placebo was 12% at 12 mg and
15% when only periods with normal consistency and hard
stool were considered. this effect started early during the first
week of treatment and persisted for the full 3 months of the
study duration. the effect was more pronounced for females
than for males. the only adverse event that was reported
more frequently by patients treated with  xxxd3302xxx  in comparison to those treated with placebo was diarrhoea, which is
expected given the mode of action of the drug. no cardiovascular adverse events were reported.
even if the therapeutic gain seems small compared to placebo, the study has a number of important strengths. firstly,
the characteristics of the enrolled patients are comparable
with those of the patients that gastroenterologists may
encounter in clinical practice: they had long-standing symptoms (∼ 10 years) characterised by constipation, bloating and
abdominal pain. they were predominantly female (83%) and
were also taking other medications that are often used by
patients with constipation predominant ibs (laxatives, antidepressants). moreover, 14% of the patients alternated diarrhoea and constipation during the baseline period before the
drug administration, even if they had not reported any episode of diarrhoea in the 3 months preceding the enrolment:
alternating diarrhoea and constipation is common among
patients in clinical practice [65]
secondly, the effect of  xxxd3302xxx  was evaluated, as recently
recommended by the rome ii working group [64], with an

assessment (the sga) that provides a reflection of overall ibs
symptom severity [66].
thirdly, the onset of action of relief, measured by the sga
of relief, was rapid (within the first week of treatment) and
was maintained for 3 months. adverse event rates and thus
withdrawal rates were low, allowing most patients to obtain
long-lasting relief. finally, the efficacy was shown for several
aspects of the ibs symptom complex including abdominal
pain/discomfort, constipation and also abdominal bloating.
although abdominal bloating is a supportive symptom in
ibs diagnosis it is present and bothersome in 40 – 60% of
ibs patients with symptoms of constipation [6,7]. it is important to consider that ibs is a heterogeneous disorder in
which many symptoms are present simultaneously. the therapy of this syndrome is currently based on a multi-therapy
that frequently treats one symptom and does not change or
aggravates the others [8,9].  xxxd3302xxx  has the clear advantage
that it seems to treat the full range of constipation-predominant ibs symptoms.
however, as recently pointed out by camilleri, some of the
study results require cautious interpretation. even though the
efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  seems to be more pronounced in females
than males, the number of males included in the study is too
low to avoid a type ii statistical error in the analysis of the
efficacy of drug in this gender. moreover, the interpretation of
the data concerning the effectiveness of  xxxd3302xxx  in the context of laxative use is complicated by the restriction to the use
of this medication during the study. the laxatives were
allowed for < 5 days during the treatment period and completely stopped during the last 28 days. this restriction does
not allow discovering the real effects of  xxxd3302xxx  during laxative treatment [67].
5.1 adverse events

in clinical trials
in clinical trials to date, 5632 subjects, including 3670
patients with ibs and symptoms related to constipation, have
been given  xxxd3302xxx . of these, 862 patients have been
exposed for > 6 months and 186 have been exposed for
> 12 months. doses of up to 24 mg have been given to ibs
patients with constipation as their main symptom and up to
300 mg/day to healthy volunteers.
 xxxd3302xxx  was well-tolerated in both short- and long-term
treatment regimens and in both healthy subjects and ibs
patients. few placebo-controlled studies in healthy subjects
are available. moreover, these studies have been performed in
small groups of subjects. on the contrary, most of the studies
in ibs patients have been performed in large, placebo-controlled series. as indicated above, the common side effects
reported were diarrhoea, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain
and headache. in ibs patients treated with  xxxd3302xxx , only
diarrhoea was reported more frequently than in patients
treated with placebo: in the three double-blind, large-scale trials 10.7% of those receiving  xxxd3302xxx  versus 5.4% receiving
placebo reported diarrhoea [68]. diarrhoea was mild, occurred
in the first week of treatment and was transient. the percent-

age of drop-out in the studies because of diarrhoea was ∼ 2%.
 xxxd3302xxx  does not appear to be associated with qt prolongation. in the randomised placebo-controlled trials no electrocardiographic effects were seen [56,60,62]. in an additional study
of 36 healthy males, very high doses of  xxxd3302xxx  leading to
plasma concentrations up to 100 times those seen following
therapeutic doses did not affect electrocardiogram parameters
[69]. moreover, a recent meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of  xxxd3302xxx  confirmed that the drug has no significant difference in total adverse events, abdominal pelvic
surgery rates or cholecystectomy rates [63].
6. conclusion

and expert opinion

 xxxd3302xxx  appears to be a promising new drug for the treatment of constipation-predominant ibs. compared to other
compounds acting on the same receptor, the characteristics of
a selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist allow  xxxd3302xxx  to be effective in the absence of major side effects. the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are favourable to allow clinical
efficacy at relatively low doses of administration, despite a low

oral bioavailability.  xxxd3302xxx  influences gi motility, secretion
and sensitivity to colorectal distention. these actions offer a
potential for the correction of several aspects of gut dysfunction involved in the pathophysiology of ibs symptoms. however, the few pharmacodynamic studies yet conducted in
humans do not show which of these mechanisms leads to the
efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  in ibs. large-scale, controlled clinical
studies have confirmed the efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  in the treatment of constipation-predominant ibs symptoms.  xxxd3302xxx 
improved overall ibs symptom assessment, as well as the
severity of individual symptoms, such as constipation, bloating and abdominal discomfort or pain. the efficacy of  xxxd3302xxx  has been most comprehensively demonstrated in female
patients; however, the number of male patients studied is relatively low. the safety profile of  xxxd3302xxx  in large-scale clinical
trials was excellent, with only diarrhoea occurring more frequently compared with placebo. the potential of  xxxd3302xxx  to
treat other disorders of gi function, such as gastroesophageal
reflux disease, gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, gi pseudoobstruction or slow transit constipation, is now beginning to
be explored, with positive results in functional dyspepsia [70].
