background and purpose
most patients with cancer die not because of the tumour in the primary site, but because it has spread to other sites.
common tumours, such as breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate tumours, frequently metastasize to the bone. to search for
an inhibitor of cancer-induced bone loss, we investigated the effect of  xxxd3350xxx , a semi-synthetic colchicoside derived
from the plant gloriosa superba and clinically used as a muscle relaxant, on osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator
of  xxxg1559xxx  ligand (rankl) and tumour cells.

experimental approach
we used raw 264.7 (murine macrophage) cells, a well-established system for osteoclastogenesis, and evaluated the effect of
 xxxd3350xxx  on rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  signalling and osteoclastogenesis as well as on osteoclastogenesis induced by
tumour cells.

key results
 xxxd3350xxx  suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl, and by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells.
inhibition of the  xxxg1559xxx  pathway was responsible for this effect since the colchicoside inhibited rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx 
activation, activation of ikb kinase (ikk) and suppressed inhibitor of nf-kba ( xxxg1561xxx ) phosphorylation and degradation, an
inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx . furthermore, an inhibitor of the  xxxg1561xxx  kinase g or  xxxg1559xxx  essential modulator, the regulatory component of
the ikk complex, demonstrated that the  xxxg1559xxx  signalling pathway is mandatory for osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl.

conclusions and implications
together, these data suggest that  xxxd3350xxx  significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl and tumour
cells via the  xxxg1559xxx  signalling pathway. thus,  xxxd3350xxx , a drug that has been used for almost half a century to treat
muscle pain, may also be considered as a new treatment for bone loss.

introduction
enhanced osteoclastogenesis is an important pathological
feature in many age-associated bone diseases, such as
osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, paget’s disease of bone, malignant bone diseases, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, periodontal diseases and bacteria-induced osteolysis (phan et al.,
2004). the bone is a dynamic tissue that undergoes continuous adaptation to attain and preserve the skeletal size and
shape. this perpetual bone remodelling depends on a fine
balance between two dynamic processes, bone formation and
bone resorption (xu et al., 2009). the cell types responsible
for these opposing processes are the bone-forming osteoblasts
and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. the osteoclast is a unique
bone-resorbing cell derived from the cells of the monocyte–
macrophage lineage that removes bone tissue by removing its
mineralized matrix and breaking up the organic bone (boyle
et al., 2003). osteoclast progenitor cells are recruited from
haematopoietic compartments, and then differentiate and
proliferate towards mature osteoclasts. during this multistep
differentiation process, post-mitotic osteoclast precursors
progressively express osteoclast-associated markers, like  xxxg321xxx  and  xxxg45xxx  (trap).
then, mononuclear pre-osteoclasts fuse together to form
multinucleated giant cells. terminal osteoclast differentiation
eventually leads to active bone-resorbing cells (takahashi
et al., 1994).
one of the key factors mediating the differentiation of a
monocyte into an osteoclast is the receptor activator of  xxxg1559xxx 
ligand (rankl) (anderson et al., 1997), a cytokine and a
member of the tnf family. rankl, which is expressed on the
surface of osteoblastic/stromal cells, is directly involved in
the differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts (lacey et al.,
1998; teitelbaum, 2000). indeed, mice with disruptions in
the rankl gene show a lack of osteoclasts, severe osteopetrosis
and defective tooth eruption, indicating that rankl is essential for osteoclast differentiation (kong et al., 1999). this
cytokine activates osteoclast formation by stimulating its
receptor rank through its interaction with the adaptor molecule tnf receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6) (yavropoulou
and yovos, 2008). traf6 then activates the ikb kinases
(ikks), which phosphorylate and degrade the inhibitor of
 xxxg1559xxx ,  xxxg1561xxx  (yavropoulou and yovos, 2008). once  xxxg1561xxx  is
degraded,  xxxg1559xxx  translocates to the nucleus and activates the
transcription of specific genes involved in the differentiation
process (xu et al., 2009).
rankl has also emerged as a major mediator of bone
cancer pain (saad et al., 2008). bone cancer pain is common
in patients who have advanced multiple myeloma or
advanced breast, prostate, or lung cancer, which are all
tumours with a marked propensity to metastasize to the bone
(coleman, 2001). multiple myeloma, for example, metastasizes to the bone in approximately 90% of cases (coleman,
2001; 2006). in addition, about threequarters of patients with
advanced breast cancer or hormone-refractory prostate
cancer, as well as 40% of patients with advanced non-small
cell lung cancer and carcinoma, develop tumour metastases
in the bone (coleman, 2001; 2006). tumours that metastasize
to the bone are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
because they induce significant skeletal remodelling, fractures, pain and anaemia (jimenez-andrade et al., 2010). in

fact, most patients with cancer die not due to the tumour in
the primary site, but because it has spread to other sites, such
as the bone.
although bisphosphonates are approved and are frequently used to reduce tumour-induced bone destruction and
bone cancer pain, they have unwanted side effects (including
induction of arthralgia and osteonecrosis of the jaw) (drake
et al., 2008) and it has yet to be definitively shown that they
effectively increase the survival of patients with bone cancer.
therefore, other treatments are urgently needed. one way
to expedite drug development is to discover new uses
for older, clinically approved drugs.  xxxd3350xxx 
(figure 1a), a semi-synthetic drug derived from colchicoside,
which is itself a natural glucoside present in the plant gloriosa
superba, might be such an agent for inhibiting rankl and
thus perhaps osteoclastogenesis as well.  xxxd3350xxx  has
been used clinically for more than 35 years as an analgesic, a
muscle relaxant and to treat a number of orthopaedic, traumatic and rheumatological conditions. furthermore, since
clinical trials have shown that the colchicoside is an efficient
and safe treatment for patients with acute low back pain
accompanied by muscle spasm (tuzun et al., 2003; ketenci
et al., 2005; soonawalla and joshi, 2008), this drug could
rapidly enter phase ii studies. our own group has previously
published the potential mechanism for its anti-inflammatory
effects (reuter et al., 2010).
in the present study, we investigated whether  xxxd3350xxx  can suppress  xxxg1559xxx  activation induced by rankl and
suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl and cancer
cells. we used a homogeneous, clonal, population of raw
264.7 murine monocytic cells because this system contains
no osteoblast/bone marrow stromal cells and no cytokine-like
macrophage  xxxg526xxx  ( xxxg524xxx ); both of these
features allowed us to focus on rankl signalling in preosteoclast cells. our results demonstrated that  xxxd3350xxx  suppresses the rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation
pathway by inhibiting ikk and that this effect correlated with
the suppression of osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl and
cancer cells.

cell lines
raw 264.7 (mouse macrophage) cells were kindly provided
by dr bryant darnay (department of experimental therapeutics, the university of texas md anderson cancer center,
houston, tx, usa). for our studies, we used a single clone
(#28) that was selected after limited dilution. raw 264.7 cells
were cultured in dmem/f12 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and antibiotics. this cell line is a wellestablished osteoclastogenic cell system that has been shown
to express rank and differentiate into functional trappositive osteoclasts when cultured with soluble rankl (hsu
et al., 1999). moreover, rankl has been shown to activate
 xxxg1559xxx  in raw 264.7 cells (wei et al., 2001). mda-mb-231
(human breast adenocarcinoma) and u266 (human multiple
myeloma) cells were obtained from the american type
culture collection. mda-mb-231 cells were cultured in
dmem, and u266 cells were cultured in rpmi 1640, with
10% fetal bovine serum. all the media were supplemented
with penicillin and streptomycin.

osteoclast differentiation assays
raw 264.7 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of
10 ¥ 103 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. the
medium was then replaced, and the cells were treated with
5 nm rankl for 5 days. all cell lines were subjected to trap
staining using the leucocyte acid phosphatase kit. for
co-culture experiments with cancer cells, raw 264.7 cells
were seeded at 5 ¥ 103 cells per well and allowed to adhere
overnight. the following day, mda-mb-231 or u266 cells, at
1 ¥ 103 cells per well, were added to the raw 264.7 cells,
treated with  xxxd3350xxx , and co-cultured for 5 days
before being subjected to trap staining.
for conditioned medium experiments, raw 264.7 cells
were seeded  xxxd1891xxx  ¥ 103 cells per well and allowed to adhere
overnight. the following day, the medium was replaced with
4/5 of raw 264.7 medium (dmem/f12) plus 1/5 of conditioned medium from mda-mb-231 or u266 cells. for that
procedure, the supernatant of cultured cancer cells that had
been centrifuged was used. finally, the raw 264.7 cells were
cultured for 5 days and subjected to trap staining.

cell proliferation assay
we employed a method as described previously with minor
modification (pandey et al., 2007). in brief, 2 ¥ 103 of raw
264.7 cells (in 0.1 ml) per well were incubated with various
concentrations of  xxxd3350xxx , in triplicate, for 1, 3
or 5 days in 96-well plates at 37°c. thereafter, 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution was added to each well. after 2 h of incubation at 37°c,
2130

lysis buffer [20%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) and 50%
dimethylformamide] was added and the cells were incubated
overnight at 37°c. absorbance was measured at 570 nm using
a 96-well multi-scanner ( xxxg22xxx  revelation; dynex technologies, chantilly, va, usa).

trypan blue dye exclusion assay for
cell viability
control cells and cells treated with different concentrations
of  xxxd3350xxx  were stained with trypan blue. viable and
dead cells were counted using a haemocytometer. we
counted around 300 cells for each sample in triplicate.
from the total number of cells, % viable cells were plotted
graphically.

phosphatidylserine externalization assay for
cell viability
we measured the loss of membrane asymmetry, an indicator
of loss in cell viability that occurs when phosphatidylserine
moves to the extracellular surface of the membrane using an
 xxxg166xxx  staining kit (santa cruz biotechnology). the assay
was performed by following the manufacturer’s instructions.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay
the nuclear extracts from control and treated cells were incubated with 32p-end-labelled 45-mer double-stranded  xxxg1559xxx 
oligonucleotide from the human immunodeficiency virus
long terminal repeat, 5-ttgttacaagggactttccgctg
gggactttccagggggaggcgtgg-3 (boldface indicates
 xxxg1559xxx -binding sites) for 30 min at 37°c. the resulting dna–
protein complex was separated from free oligonucleotide on
6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. the dried gels were visualized with a storm 820 optical scanner (ge healthcare, piscataway, nj, usa). radioactive bands were quantified using a
densitometer and image quant software. for conditioned
medium experiments, raw 264.7 cells were seeded at 2 ¥ 106
cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. the following
day, the medium was replaced with 4/5 of raw 264.7
medium (dmem/f12) and 1/5 of conditioned medium
from mda-mb-231 or u266 cells. for that procedure, we used
the supernatant of centrifuged, cultured cancer cells. the
raw 264.7 cells were then cultured for 24 h and assessed for
 xxxg1559xxx  activity by using emsa. fold values were based on the
value for medium without rankl, which was arbitrarily set
at 1.

western blot analysis
to determine the levels of protein expression, we prepared
cytoplasmic and whole-cell extracts (sung et al., 2007)
and fractionated them by using 10% sds-page. after
electrophoresis, the proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody and
detected with the chemiluminescence reagent ecl (ge
healthcare).

ikk assay
to determine the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on ranklinduced ikk activation, an ikk assay was performed using a
method described previously (wei et al., 2001). briefly, the

ikk complex from whole-cell extracts (600 mg of protein) of
raw 264.7 cells was precipitated with antibody against  xxxg463xxx 
and then treated with protein a/g agarose beads. after 2 h of
incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and
assayed in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm hepes
(ph 7.4), 20 mm mgcl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mci [g-32p]atp, 10 mm unlabelled atp and 2 mg of substrate glutathione
transferase (gst)- xxxg1561xxx  (amino acids 1–54). after incubation
at 30°c for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling
with sds sample buffer for 5 min. finally, the protein was
resolved on 10% sds-page, the gel was dried and the radioactive bands were visualized with a phosphorimager. to
determine the total amounts of  xxxg463xxx  and  xxxg1159xxx  in each
sample, the whole-cell protein was resolved on 10% sdspage, electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and
blotted with anti- xxxg463xxx  or anti- xxxg1159xxx  antibody.

statistical analysis
results from at least three independent experiments were
analysed for statistical significance. the statistical analysis
was carried out using a two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test.
they are expressed as the mean ⫾ sd. **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05
when compared to their respective control.

results
our study was designed to investigate the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on osteoclastogenesis induced by rankl and cancer
cells and on rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation.

 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits rankl-induced
osteoclastogenesis
because rankl is one of the major cytokines that induces
osteoclastogenesis, we used it to induce differentiation of
osteoclasts and investigated whether  xxxd3350xxx  can
modulate this differentiation. raw 264.7 cells were incubated with rankl,  xxxd3350xxx  or both for 3–5 days and
allowed to differentiate into osteoclasts (figure 1b). the morphological observations clearly revealed differentiation of
cells into osteoclasts after addition of rankl (figure 1b,
middle panel) and that the colchicoside suppressed this differentiation (figure 1b, right panel). this suppression was
found to be dose-dependent (figure 1c). counting of trap+
osteoclasts confirmed that rankl induced osteoclast differentiation in a time-dependent manner, with the greatest
number of trap+ osteoclasts at day 5 (figure 1d), and that
 xxxd3350xxx  dose-dependently decreased the number of
trap+ osteoclasts, with almost complete inhibition at 30 mm
at all days examined (figure 1d).
to exclude the possibility that this observation was due to
a reduction in cell proliferation by  xxxd3350xxx , we
analysed the proliferation of raw 264.7 cells treated with
0–30 mm  xxxd3350xxx  at days 1, 3 or 5. the colchicoside
did not significantly affect the proliferation of raw 264.7
cells (figure 1e).
to further examine the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on cell
viability, we treated raw 264.7 cells with 30, 50 and 100 mm
 xxxd3350xxx  for 24 h, stained the cells with trypan blue
and counted % viable cells of total number of cells. the cell

viability was not significantly affected by  xxxd3350xxx 
treatment even at 100 mm (figure 1f). furthermore, the
 xxxg166xxx  assay indicated 5–8% apoptotic cells at 30–100 mm
 xxxd3350xxx  (data not shown).

 xxxd3350xxx  acts at an early step in the
rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis pathway
complete osteoclast differentiation of raw 264.7 cells takes
up to 5 days after rankl stimulation. to identify the step at
which  xxxd3350xxx  acts in this differentiation pathway,
we initially treated the cells with rankl and, 1, 2, 3 or 4 days
later, added  xxxd3350xxx . as determined by visual observation (figure 2a, right panel) and counting the number of
trap+ osteoclasts per well (figure 2b), we found that  xxxd3350xxx  almost completely inhibited osteoclast formation when the cells were exposed to  xxxd3350xxx  for 1 or
2 days after rankl stimulation. however, at days 3 and 4
after rankl addition, osteoclast formation was no longer
completely prevented by  xxxd3350xxx . this result suggests that  xxxd3350xxx  acts at an early step in the osteoclast differentiation pathway.

 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits osteoclastogenesis
induced by cancer cells
given that osteoclastogenesis is commonly linked with breast
cancer and multiple myeloma, we next investigated whether
 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by these
cancers. raw 264.7 cells were co-incubated with breast
cancer (mda-mb-231) cells or multiple myeloma (u266) cells
and allowed to differentiate for 5 days (figure 3a and b).
mda-mb-231 cells induced differentiation of raw 264.7 cells
into osteoclasts, and  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited this differentiation (figure 3a). the same was observed for u266 cells
(figure 3b).
to investigate whether cancer cells act directly or indirectly (by secreting certain cytokines) on osteoclasts, raw
264.7 cells were co-incubated with only the medium of cultured mda-mb-231 or u266 cells (i.e. conditioned medium)
for 5 days (figure 3a and b, right panels). the quantified
results clearly indicate that conditioned medium alone was
sufficient to activate osteoclastogenesis in raw 264.7 cells,
indicating that certain cytokines secreted by tumour cells are
responsible for osteoclast differentiation. furthermore, treatment with  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited osteoclastogenesis
induced by the conditioned medium (figure 3a and b, right
panels).

 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits rankl-induced
 xxxg1559xxx  activation
we next investigated how  xxxd3350xxx  inhibits osteoclast differentiation induced by rankl and by cancer cells.
one major mechanism that has been associated with osteoclastogenesis is activation of the  xxxg1559xxx  pathway. therefore,
we explored whether conditioned medium from cancer cells
(mda-mb-231 and u266) induces  xxxg1559xxx  activation in raw
264.7 cells and found that they did effectively activate  xxxg1559xxx 
(figure 3c), indicating that this transcription factor is
involved in osteoclast differentiation by cancer cells.
we also used emsa to study the effect of  xxxd3350xxx 
on rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation in raw 264.7 cells

activation at 50 mm.  xxxd3350xxx  alone did not activate
 xxxg1559xxx .

 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits rankl-induced
 xxxg1561xxx  degradation and phosphorylation
because the translocation of  xxxg1559xxx  to the nucleus follows the
proteolytic degradation of  xxxg1561xxx , we next sought to determine
whether the  xxxd3350xxx -induced  xxxg1559xxx  inhibition was
due to inhibition of  xxxg1561xxx  degradation. therefore, we used
emsa to examine the  xxxg1559xxx  expression level after different
stimulation times by rankl in the nucleus (figure 4b) and
for  xxxg1561xxx  degradation in the cytoplasm by western blotting
(figure 5a). rankl activated  xxxg1559xxx  within 5 min, and  xxxd3350xxx  suppressed this activation (figure 4b). in accordance with the emsa results, western blot analysis showed
that rankl induced  xxxg1561xxx  degradation in control cells after
5 min and returned to normal level within 60 min
(figure 5a). in contrast, cells pretreated with  xxxd3350xxx 
showed no degradation of  xxxg1561xxx .
 xxxg1561xxx  phosphorylation is necessary for  xxxg1561xxx  degradation,
so we next investigated the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on  xxxg1561xxx 
phosphorylation by using the proteasome inhibitor n- xxxd1096xxx  (alln), which prevents ranklinduced  xxxg1561xxx  degradation (figure 5b). western blot analysis
showed that rankl and alln together induced phosphorylation of  xxxg1561xxx  at serines 32 and 36, and that  xxxd3350xxx 
pretreatment inhibited this activation in raw 264.7 cells;
 xxxd3350xxx  alone did not induce phosphorylation of
 xxxg1561xxx  (figure 5b). these results clearly indicate that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation as
well as  xxxg1561xxx  degradation and phosphorylation.

those containing three nuclei) was counted. cells exposed to

because ikk is required for rankl-induced phosphorylation
of  xxxg1561xxx  and  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited the phosphorylation
of  xxxg1561xxx , we determined the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on
rankl-induced  xxxg1561xxx  activation by ikk. results of the
immune complex kinase assay showed that rankl strongly
induced the phosphorylation of gst- xxxg1561xxx  by ikk within
2 min, and that  xxxd3350xxx  completely inhibited this
phosphorylation (figure 5c). neither rankl nor  xxxd3350xxx  affected the expression of  xxxg463xxx  or  xxxg1159xxx  proteins.
given that phosphorylation of  xxxg1561xxx  by the ikk complex
required phosphorylation of the subunits  xxxg463xxx /b, we next
investigated whether  xxxd3350xxx  also inhibited phosphorylation of  xxxg463xxx /b. raw 264.7 cells were pretreated with
 xxxd3350xxx  and stimulated with rankl (figure 5d).
western blot results with p- xxxg463xxx /b antibody showed that
 xxxd3350xxx  completely inhibited phosphorylation of
 xxxg463xxx /b, suggesting that this mechanism is important for the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on rankl-induced
 xxxg1559xxx  activation.

inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by
 xxxd3350xxx  is  xxxg1559xxx  specific
(figure 4a). cells were pretreated with 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100 mm
 xxxd3350xxx  for 24 h, and then activated with rankl for
30 min. our results show that rankl activated  xxxg1559xxx  and
that the colchicoside inhibited rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx

rankl induces  xxxg1559xxx  activation and  xxxd3350xxx  inhibits it in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (a) raw 264.7 cells (1.5 ¥ 106 per well)

with  xxxd3350xxx  for 24 and 48 h before rankl treatment. we found that rankl activated erk in a timedependent manner and  xxxd3350xxx  pretreatment did
not inhibit the activation (figure 5e). instead, a slight activation in  xxxd3350xxx -treated samples was noted at 5 min.
to further ascertain the specificity of  xxxg1559xxx  in osteoclastogenesis, we used a specific inhibitor of the regulatory
subunit of the ikk complex, ikkg, which is also known as
nemo. whereas the serine kinases  xxxg463xxx  and  xxxg1159xxx  target
serines 32 and 36 of the  xxxg1561xxx  protein, nemo regulates the
ikk complex activity through its binding to the carboxylterminal region of the  xxxg463xxx  and  xxxg1159xxx  subunits, called the
nemo-binding domain. in this regard, a cell-permeable
peptide that blocks the nemo-binding domain would inhibit
the association of nemo with the ikk complex and consequently suppress  xxxg1559xxx  activation and, most likely,
osteoclastogenesis. to determine the effect of the nbp on
rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis, we pretreated raw 264.7
cells with 100 mm nbp for 2 h and then with rankl for 5
days (figure 6a and b). our results showed that the peptide
strongly inhibited osteoclast differentiation (figure 6a and
2134

b). furthermore, when we treated nuclear extracts from raw
264.7 cells with 100 mm nbp for 2 h and then with rankl for
30 min, rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation was completely
inhibited (figure 6c). these results confirm that  xxxg1559xxx  was
responsible for osteoclast differentiation of raw 264.7 cells,
and that inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  by either  xxxd3350xxx  or
nbp prevented osteoclastogenesis.

discussion
a semi-synthetic derivative of colchicoside,  xxxd3350xxx ,
is a natural glucoside present in the plant g. superba, which is
the national flower of zimbabwe and the state flower of the
indian state tamil nadu. various preparations of this plant
are used in traditional medicines for a variety of complaints
in both africa and india. in western medicine,  xxxd3350xxx  ( xxxd3350xxx ) has been used for more than 35 years as a
muscle relaxant, analgesic compound and anti-inflammatory
drug to treat a number of orthopaedic, traumatic and rheumatological conditions (janbroers, 1987). clinical trials have

shown that  xxxd3350xxx  is an efficient and safe treatment
for patients with acute low back pain accompanied by muscle
spasm (tuzun et al., 2003), and that it is at least as effective as
tizanidine, the standard drug used to treat low back pain
(ketenci et al., 2005; soonawalla and joshi, 2008). moreover,
biochemical studies have indicated that  xxxd3350xxx 
can inhibit the binding of both the [3h]-gaba and
[3h]-strychnine receptors to rat cerebrocortical and spinal
cord membranes (biziere et al., 1981; cimino et al., 1996),
suggesting that it induces depression of the cns and, in turn,
myorelaxation, probably via this mechanism (biziere et al.,
1981). clinical trials have also proven the efficacy and safety
of  xxxd3350xxx  in treating acute cervical myofascial pain
syndrome (tuzun et al., 2003; ketenci et al., 2005; 2009;
soonawalla and joshi, 2008).
in a previous study, we reported that  xxxd3350xxx ’s
anti-inflammatory properties are probably due to its ability to
inhibit the  xxxg1559xxx  signalling pathway (reuter et al., 2010),
which has also been demonstrated to be a major mediator of
bone loss (xu et al., 2009). for example, mice lacking the
 xxxg1559xxx  subunits p50 and p52 and mice deficient in  xxxg1159xxx  show
severe osteopetrosis caused by failure of osteoclast formation
(franzoso et al., 1997; zheng et al., 2006). furthermore, abuamer and colleagues reported that a ikb super-suppressor
blocked osteoclast differentiation and activation (abu-amer
et al., 2001), and that a dominant-negative ikb protein
lacking the nh2-terminal phosphorylation site lowered  xxxg1559xxx 
activation and suppressed recruitment of osteoclasts (clohisy
et al., 2003). therefore, a compound that inhibits  xxxg1559xxx 
is very likely to be able to inhibit osteoclastogenesis as well.
our results indicate that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibits ranklinduced  xxxg1559xxx  activation by inactivating the ikk complex,
through inhibition of the phosphorylation of  xxxg463xxx /b, and
thereby preventing  xxxg1559xxx  activation via inhibition of  xxxg1561xxx 
phosphorylation and degradation.
in this study, we investigated whether  xxxd3350xxx ,
in addition to inhibiting rankl-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation,
would also inhibit rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. for
this, we co-treated raw 264.7 cells with  xxxd3350xxx  and
rankl. raw 264.7 cells are a homogeneous, clonal population of murine monocytic cells that do not contain any
osteoblast/bone marrow stromal cells or cytokine like  xxxg524xxx 
and therefore allow us to focus only on rank signalling in
pre-osteoclast cells. we have previously published that this
system parallels with peripheral blood mononuclear cells
stimulated with  xxxg524xxx  and rankl (bharti et al., 2004b; kunnumakkara et al., 2007).
our results indicated that the colchicoside effectively
inhibits rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. in addition, a
kinetic study indicated that  xxxd3350xxx  acts at an early
step in the differentiation process of the osteoclasts. to
further confirm that inhibition of the  xxxg1559xxx  signalling
pathway is responsible for the arrest of the osteoclastogenesis
process in our system, we used a cell-permeable peptide that
targets the nemo-binding domain of the  xxxg463xxx  and  xxxg1159xxx 
kinases and so prevents  xxxg1559xxx  activation. this nbp has been
shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in vivo and to delay the
onset, lower the incidence and decrease the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (dai et al., 2004). in addition, previous
studies have demonstrated that pharmacological or genetic
inactivation of  xxxg463xxx ,  xxxg1159xxx  or both is sufficient for inhibition

 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis

of osteoclastogenesis and for prevention of inflammation and
osteolytic-induced bone loss (chaisson et al., 2004; ruocco
et al., 2005). our results showed that nbp completely blocked
rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis in the same manner as
 xxxd3350xxx . the inhibitory effect of 100 mm nbp was as
potent as 30 mm  xxxd3350xxx , which suggests that the
latter is a more potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, at least
in vitro.
binding of rankl to its receptor rank activates two
major signalling pathways leading to osteoclastogenesis, the
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway via traf6 and the mapk pathway via activation of erk and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun (bharti
and aggarwal, 2004). while erk is responsible for osteoclast
survival,  xxxg1559xxx  regulates osteoclast activation for bone
resorption (miyazaki et al., 2000). our studies showed that
 xxxd3350xxx  does not affect the mapk pathway. these
studies, together with our results with nbp, suggest that  xxxd3350xxx ’s inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis is specific to  xxxg1559xxx  inhibition.
to establish  xxxd3350xxx ’s effect on cancer cellinduced osteoclastogenesis, we used breast cancer cells and
multiple myeloma cells that are known to express rankl (lai
et al., 2004; bhatia et al., 2005) and to exhibit constitutive
 xxxg1559xxx  activation (biswas et al., 2004; bharti et al., 2004a).
breast cancer cells can directly resorb bone, and evidence
from clinical studies suggests that the main mechanism
responsible for bone destruction in cancer patients is tumourmediated stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption
(roodman, 2001). furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that myeloma cells enhance osteoclast formation and
activity through up-regulation of rankl (giuliani et al.,
2001; 2002; pearse et al., 2001) or by expressing rankl themselves (farrugia et al., 2003; heider et al., 2003). it is now well
defined that osteoclasts, not tumour cells, are principally
responsible for the osteolysis observed in bone metastases
and directly lead to the bony pathologies observed in these
patients (canon et al., 2008).
in our study,  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited osteoclastogenesis induced by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells,
indicating that this compound is an attractive potential agent
for treating patients with metastasis to the bone. moreover,
our studies with raw 264.7 cells co-incubated with conditioned medium from u266 or mda-mb-231 cells confirmed
that certain factors secreted by tumour cells stimulate osteoclast differentiation. our laboratory has previously shown
that osteoclastogenesis induced by cancer cells effectively
correlate with rankl expression in these tumour cells (sung
et al., 2009; 2011). furthermore,  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited
osteoclastogenesis induced by conditioned medium from
u266 or mda-mb-231 cells, suggesting that the colchicoside
acts directly on osteoclasts and not on the proliferation of
u266 or mda-mb-231 cells.
bisphosphonates are the current standard treatment for
patients with bone metastasis or cancer-related bone disease
(terpos and rahemtulla, 2004; neville-webbe and coleman,
2010). however, not all patients respond to bisphosphonates,
and toxicities such as renal impairment or osteonecrosis of
the jaw can preclude the use of bisphosphonates (kyle et al.,
2007). the rankl antibody denosumab ( xxxd1833xxx ), a humanized monoclonal antibody against rankl, was recently
approved by the us food and drug administration for the

bjp

treatment and prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis
and bone loss in patients with hormone-treated prostate or
breast cancer (body et al., 2006). however, denosumab carries
black box warnings for serious side effects, such as severe
jawbone problems (osteonecrosis), skin problems (dermatitis,
rash, eczema and serious skin infections) and hypocalcaemia.
in addition, this antibody treatment is expensive.
therefore, safe treatments for bone loss are still needed.
our results suggest that  xxxd3350xxx , which is currently
approved for treating muscle pain, might be considered as a
new drug against bone loss as well. similarly, the use of
aspirin, which is an anti-inflammatory drug and  xxxg1559xxx 
inhibitor (kopp and ghosh, 1994), has now been associated
with an increase in bone mineral density of the hip and
lumbar spine (bauer et al., 1996). further celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and inhibitor of cox-2, has
also been shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis (han et al.,
2005; kasukawa et al., 2007).
overall, our results demonstrate that  xxxd3350xxx  can
suppress bone loss induced by cancer cells, and, thus, this
drug could be a safe treatment for cancer patients with bone
lesions and for patients with osteoporosis, paget’s disease or
rheumatoid arthritis. our future goal is to examine the potential of  xxxd3350xxx  against osteoclastogenesis using clinically relevant animal models before proceeding to cancer
patients.
