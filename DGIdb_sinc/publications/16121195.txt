 xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas) is the first and ratelimiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis in humans, animals, other non-plant eukaryotes, and a-proteobacteria. it
catalyzes the synthesis of  xxxd148xxx , the first
common precursor of all tetrapyrroles, from glycine and
succinyl- xxxd1739xxx  (scoa) in a pyridoxal 50 -phosphate
(plp)-dependent manner. x-linked sideroblastic anemias
(xlsas), a group of severe disorders in humans characterized by inadequate formation of heme in erythroblast
mitochondria, are caused by mutations in the gene for
erythroid ealas, one of two human genes for alas. we
present the first crystal structure of homodimeric alas
from rhodobacter capsulatus (alasrc) binding its cofactor
plp. we, furthermore, present structures of alasrc
in complex with the substrates glycine or scoa. the
sequence identity of alas from r. capsulatus and
human ealas is 49%.  xxxg123xxx -causing mutations may
thus be mapped, revealing the molecular basis of  xxxg123xxx 
in humans. mutations are found to obstruct substrate
binding, disrupt the dimer interface, or hamper the correct
folding. the structure of alas completes the structural
analysis of enzymes in heme biosynthesis.

introduction
tetrapyrroles, such as hemes and chlorophylls, are arguably
among the most important pigments in the biosphere and
the most versatile of cofactors. they are required for molecular, energy, and electron transport, o2 and co2 sensing,
as well as in countless enzymatic reactions (dailey, 1997;
frankenberg et al, 2003).

the initial enzyme of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis,  xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas; ec 2.3.1.37), was discovered by
shemin (shemin and kikuchi, 1958) and neuberger (gibson
et al, 1958). alas catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of glycine and succinyl- xxxd1739xxx  (scoa) yielding
 xxxd148xxx  (ala), the universal precursor of all
tetrapyrroles. much later, alas was found to be restricted
to non-plant eukaryotes and the a-group of proteobacteria
(jordan, 1990). in plants and most bacteria, ala is instead
derived from trna-bound glutamate in two enzymatic steps
via the c5 pathway involving glutamyl-trna reductase
(hungerer et al, 1996; moser et al, 1999, 2001) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (hennig et al, 1997).
humans and other mammals produce two isoforms of
alas: housekeeping halas, ubiquitously expressed in
all cell types, and erythroid-specific ealas, exclusively
produced in developing erythrocytes (riddle et al, 1989).
ealas produces b90% of the total body heme. alas
is highly conserved from a-proteobacteria to humans, the
sequence identity ranging from 40 to 80%. thus, for example,
the sequence identity of human ealas and rhodobacter
capsulatus alas (alasrc) is 49%, rising to 70% if similar
residues are included.
alas is a pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (plp)-dependent homodimer, composed of 44–65 kda monomers. it belongs to the
oxoamine synthase subgroup of a-division plp-dependent
enzymes (mehta and christen, 1994; christen and mehta,
2001). the catalytic mechanism of the alas reaction
involves binding of glycine to plp to form a plp–glycine
complex (external aldimine; scheme 1). following proton
abstraction, the resonance-stabilized quinonoid intermediate
nucleophilically attacks scoa, the second substrate. release
of coa and decarboxylation of the resulting intermediate
yields ala. the final step, release of ala, is the slowest
and hence rate-limiting step of the reaction (ferreira et al,
1993; zhang and ferreira, 2002; cheltsov et al, 2003).
mutations in the human gene for ealas ( xxxg123xxx ) cause
x-linked sideroblastic anemia ( xxxg123xxx ), a group of severe
disorders characterized by inadequate formation of heme
and accumulation of iron in erythroblast mitochondria
(may and bishop, 1998). the physiological concentration of
iron is normally tightly regulated to prevent nonspecific iron
binding (andrews, 1999). iron overloads, as in  xxxg123xxx , disturb
the cellular reduction–oxidation state and reduce cellular
lifetime, making ealas critical for erythroid cell differentiation and survival (harigae et al, 2003). a biological half-life
of a mere hour means that mammalian ealas is notoriously
difficult to purify from natural sources (furuyama and
sassa, 2002). we have therefore selected bacterial alas
for the structural elucidation, especially as the high degree
of sequence identity between bacterial and the core human
alas should allow the former to serve as a suitable structural
model for the latter.

scheme 1 the reaction mechanism of alas. in the substrate-free state, the cofactor plp is bound by lys248 (alasrc), the internal aldimine.
incoming glycine induces transaldimination, leading to plp binding glycine rather than lys248 (external aldimine). the substrate scoa
is nucleophilically attacked by the plp-activated glycine, leading to the addition of  xxxd3251xxx  to glycine and concomitant loss of
coa. decarboxylation (carboxylate of the glycine moiety) of this intermediate yields the plp-bound product, released in the rate-limiting
step of the reaction.

results and discussion

alasrc is a tightly interlocked homodimer (figure 1). each
monomer consists of three domains, all of which participate
in dimerization: an n-terminal domain (residues 1–52, yellow in figure 1), a central, catalytic domain (residues 53–296,
orange) that contributes most of the dimer interface, and
a c-terminal domain (residues 297–401, red). the n-terminal
domain consists of an a-helix, remote from the rest of the
monomer, and a three-stranded, antiparallel b-sheet. the
large central or catalytic domain bears a seven-stranded,
largely parallel b-sheet (b-strand order: 32456701, 0 implying
an antiparallel orientation) covered on either side by nine
a-helices in repeated b/a motifs. the c-terminal domain
includes a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet contacting
both n-terminal and catalytic domains of the same monomer
and three a-helices contacting the n-terminal domain.

the structure of alas
alas has previously been identified as a member of the
oxoamine synthase subgroup of a-division plp-dependent
enzymes (grishin et al, 1995; mehta and christen, 2000;
schneider et al, 2000). the structure of alas from
r. capsulatus (alasrc) was correspondingly solved by
molecular replacement, using a model consisting of
the superimposed structures of 8-amino-7-oxononanoate
synthase (aons; pdb code 1bs0; alexeev et al, 1998) and
2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase (kbl; pdb code 1fc4;
schmidt et al, 2001) of this subgroup. the structure was
analyzed to a maximum resolution of 2.1 å, with two dimers
in the asymmetric unit. data collection and refinement
statistics are summarized in table i.

plp-binding site and active site pocket
an alasrc dimer symmetrically binds two plp molecules
(green in figure 1). in the absence of substrate or product,
plp is covalently bound as a schiff base to lys248 (hunter
and ferreira, 1999a). this lysine, conserved in all alas, is
located in loop b9–b10 of the catalytic domain. the catalytic
domain of the second monomer participates in plp binding
by providing three of six hydrogen bonds to the phosphate
group: ser277*-og and thr278*-og and -n (where * denotes
the second monomer), in addition to ala115-n, tyr116-n,
and thr245-og (figures 2 and 3a). recognition of the pyridinium ring of plp, by contrast, exclusively involves
one monomer: val216 and his142 stack on either side of

here we describe the first crystal structure of full-length
alas from r. capsulatus (alasrc), including the cofactor
plp, at 2.1 å resolution. in addition, we present the structures
of alasrc, respectively, binding glycine and scoa at 2.7 and
2.8 å. the high degree of conservation between alasrc
and human ealas allows us to derive a model for the core
of human ealas, elucidating the structural and functional
implications of naturally occurring  xxxg123xxx -inducing mutations.
in addition, we can now elucidate the structural aspects
of catalysis of the oxoamine synthase subfamily of plpdependent enzymes in unprecedented detail.

yellow, the catalytic domain in orange, and the c-terminal domain in red. the cofactor plp (green) is depicted in ball-and-stick representation,

the pyridinium ring, stabilizing it through hydrophobic interactions. specificity is achieved through the hydrogen bond
his217-ne2–plp-o3 and the salt bridge asp214-od2–plp-nd2
(the protonated nitrogen of the pyridinium ring). the latter
interaction, found in most plp-dependent enzymes, increases
the electron-withdrawing potential of the pyridinium ring
(hunter and ferreira, 1999b). the tight binding allows plp
to remain bound during catalysis, despite losing its covalent
bond to lys248. plp, instead, binds the substrate glycine
through a schiff base bond.
alongside each plp, both catalytic domains and the
c-terminal domain of the plp-binding monomer delimit
the substrate-binding pocket. this pocket is connected to
the enzyme surface by a channel (figure 4b) created by the
same domains involved in forming the active site. this
channel is clearly involved in scoa binding (see below).

binding of substrates glycine and scoa
to elucidate the binding mode of both substrates, we soaked
crystals of alasrc/plp with either glycine or scoa for 24 h.
the resulting complexes were analyzed crystallographically
to maximum resolutions of 2.7 and 2.8 å, respectively. unit
cell parameters and space group essentially remained unchanged (table i), allowing glycine and scoa to be located by
difference fourier techniques, following rigid-body and simulated-annealing refinement using the alasrc/plp structure.
the difference map of glycine-soaked crystals reveals
unambiguous residual electron density alongside plp in all
four monomers in the asymmetric unit (figure 3b). glycine is
thus covalently bound to plp through a schiff base bond,
forming the so-called ‘external aldimine’. the occupancy
of glycine, however, appears to vary, underlining the dynamic
nature of the schiff base and the known fact that the

residues are shown in dark orange. dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds (green numbers) and salt bridges (red) between substrates or
cofactors and alas; green semicircles indicate hydrophobic interactions. an asterisk marks residues from the second monomer. lys248,
involved in plp binding and catalysis, is marked by a blue box, residues affected by mutations in human ealas by a red box.

dissociation constant of alas for glycine is surprisingly high
at 1.8–30 mm (bolt et al, 1999). the glycine a-carboxylate
group forms a weak salt bridge (3.8 å) with the guanidinium
side chain of arg374 (confirming its involvement; tan et al,
1998), and hydrogen bonds to ser189-og and asn54-nd2.
in scoa-soaked crystals, significant difference electron
density is seen near the entrance of the active-site channel.
in particular, the 30 -phosphate adp moiety of scoa is well
defined (figures 3d and e)—the first time scoa and hence its
binding pocket have been located in any member of the
oxoamine synthase subfamily of plp-dependent enzymes.
it is bound within a hydrophobic pocket on the surface
of the enzyme. residues ile146 and ile158 lie on either side
of the adenine moiety, while ile149 delimits the bottom of the
pocket (figures 2, 3d and e). specificity is achieved through
hydrogen bonds ser139-o–n6, asp138-o–n6, and ser137og–n1, where n1 and n6 belong to the scoa adenine
moiety. the ribose moiety of scoa, in turn, is recognized
by a hydrogen bond from lys156-nz to o30 . the binding
pocket is located immediately alongside the entrance to the
& 2005 european molecular biology organization

active-site channel (figure 4b). at the end of the active-site
channel, a planar, three-pronged electron density opposite
the guanidinium group of arg21 is visible (figure 3e). we
have interpreted this to mark the position of the succinate
carboxylate group of scoa, forming a salt bridge to arg21nz2. this carboxylate oxygen also forms hydrogen bonds to
thr365-og and asn85*-nd, while the second oxygen forms
hydrogen bonds to thr83*-og and a buried water molecule
(figure 2). lateral van der waals interactions with ile86*
further serve to stabilize this interaction. the carboxylate
group is also seen in the absence of scoa—indicating the
high affinity for acidic groups. only weak electron density is
visible for the intermediate region better modeled as discrete
water molecules. the succinyl-pantetheine moiety of scoa
is thus disordered in the absence of the second substrate
glycine. nevertheless, the positions of the 30 -phosphate adp
and carboxylate moieties allow the entire scoa to be modeled
into the active site tunnel in an elongated conformation
(figure 3e and dashed black lines in figure 2). the modeled
positions of hydrophilic atoms of scoa (op1,  xxxg1608xxx , os1)

formation—possibly aiding later decarboxylation. (c–e) the binding of scoa to alas: (c) in three of four monomers of the scoa/alas
complex, plp is not covalently bound to lys248. this is documented by positive difference electron density in the absence of plp and side
chain of lys248 (green, contoured at 3s), the negative difference density in ‘enforced’ schiff-base bond (red, contoured at 3s, structure in
narrow bonds), and the refined electron density of unbound plp (blue, contoured at 1s, thick bonds). (d) the adenine and ribose moieties of
scoa bind in a hydrophobic (white) pocket with positively charged rim (blue) adjacent to the active-site channel. (e) the electron density is
well defined for the 30 -phosphate adp moiety and for the carboxylate group of scoa, indicating that the central portion is not rigidly bound in
the absence of the second substrate glycine.

closed conformation clamps it into position prior to catalysis. in the second dimer in the asymmetric unit (and in all monomers of the substratebound complexes) only the closed conformation is observed. (b, c) the molecular surface of the alas dimer, showing a cross section through

roughly correspond to the water molecules in the channel,
indicating that these atoms would be stabilized by hydrogen
bonds to the surrounding protein, while the remaining
aliphatic parts are stabilized by hydrophobic van der waals
interactions.
in the substrate-free structure of alas, plp is covalently
bound by lys248. the substrate glycine replaces lys248 in
binding to plp, as expected (figures 3b). however, though
scoa does not bind to plp itself, plp appears no longer to be
bound to lys248 in at least three (of four) monomers of this
complex (figure 3c). instead, the pyridinium ring of plp is
tipped by b151 around the c5–c5a bond, so that its o3
and  xxxg283xxx  atoms move away from lys248—comparable to
the glycine-bound state and to other external aldimines
of plp-dependent enzymes. the rotation of the plp ring is
accompanied by a movement of his142 in all substrate-bound
monomers, such that it remains stacked above the plp
ring. lys248 forms a new hydrogen bond through its nz to
 xxxg537xxx  of the conserved residue asn54.
superimposing the glycine- and scoa-bound complexes
of alasrc indicates that both substrates can simultaneously
be accommodated within the active site, without incurring
steric clashes (figure 4b). overall, this leads to an arrangement in which the distance between the glycine ca atom and
cs1 of scoa is b2.8 å. the nucleophilic attack of cs1 by the
deprotonated ca of the quinonoid, anionic glycyl-plp to
create the new c–c bond is thus feasible.
glycine-rich stretch
a glycine-rich stretch comprising residues 77-gagsggtr
nisgt-89, in loop a3–a4 of the catalytic domain, was earlier
proposed to be involved in substrate binding (gong et al,
1996). especially three residues, gly77, gly79, and arg84,
were found to be intolerant of mutational replacement.
indeed, the structure indicates that this loop is crucial for
the recognition of the succinyl-moiety of scoa. in particular,
residues thr83, asn85, and ile86 are directly involved
in positioning the terminal carboxylate group of scoa
(figure 3e). structurally, this intricately folded loop is
furthermore surrounded by the catalytic domain of the
same monomer and all three domains of the second monomer. it therefore occupies a particularly sensitive position that
may easily be disrupted by any change in the amino-acid
sequence. arg84 forms a salt bridge to glu97, helping to
stabilize the loop. gly77 adopts a conformation reserved for
glycines. mutated to any other residue, it would be forced
into a different region of the ramachandran plot, again
disrupting this loop and upsetting the recognition of succinyl.
open and closed alas conformations
the crystal packing in the complex alasrc/plp places
two alas dimers (or four monomers) into the asymmetric
unit. three of these monomers, a, d, and e, are structurally
essentially indistinguishable. monomer b, by contrast,
adopts an ‘open’ conformation in which two loops (residues
332–348 between b11 and a14 and residues 358–374 between
a14 and b12; red in figure 4a) of the c-terminal domain
move outwards, widening the active site, the active-site
channel, and opening a second channel, both longer and
narrower than the first (figure 4c). comparing the ‘open’ and
‘closed’ states of alas indicates that in particular thr365,
located at the outermost tip of the loop 358–375, moves
& 2005 european molecular biology organization

inwards by 3.5 å during this transition. in the closed conformation, thr365 is firmly positioned among the residues
of the active site stabilized by a hydrogen bond thr365-og1–
arg21-nz2 and by van der waals interactions thr365-cg2–
ile361- xxxd435xxx  and –met190-ce. as a result, the narrow active-site
channel winds past thr365, ending opposite the side chain of
arg21. the carboxylate group of the substrate scoa presumably fills this end of the channel, forming a hydrogen bond to
thr365-og (see above). thr365 is thus crucial in locking the
succinyl group into position and is itself locked into the
closed position when the substrate is present.
the open conformation is observed only in one monomer
of the substrate-free crystal structure. in glycine- and scoabound complexes, all monomers adopt the closed conformation. the open state presumably provides more facile
access to the active site, especially for the extensive
scoa. the closed conformation in turn constricts the active
site and active-site channel, clasping the pantetheine
and succinate moieties of scoa into position—presumably
as a prelude to catalysis. an additional salt bridge arg368–
glu17 further stabilizes the closed conformation. arg368
is conserved in comparison with human ealas, while glu17
of alasrc is replaced by aspartate (asp159) in ealas
(figure 5a).
structural aspects of enzymatic reaction
structurally and functionally, alas belongs to the a-division
of plp-dependent enzymes and along with aons, serine
 xxxd2832xxx  transferase, and kbl constitutes the a-oxoamine
synthase subfamily. these enzymes catalyze the decarboxylative condensation of a carboxylic acid coa thioester
and an amino acid (mehta and christen, 2000). of the two
substrate molecules, the amino acid (glycine in alas) is
covalently bound through a schiff base, while coa is bound
noncovalently.
the crystal structure of alasrc indicates that the
plp–glycine intermediate forms a weak salt bridge (3.8 å)
to the conserved arg374 (figure 3b). replacing the arginine
by lysine in murine ealas reduces its enzymatic activity, but
only by 23% (tan et al, 1998). clearly, a positively charged
residue is required at this position, presumably to aid initial
recognition and orientation of glycine prior to plp binding.
formation of the schiff bond in the external aldimine
(scheme 1) would cause glycine to move towards plp and
away from arg374, weakening the salt bridge interaction.
though overall stability of the glycine would be sacrificed, a
weaker salt bridge may favor elimination of the a-carboxylate
as co2 later in the reaction.
the side-chain methyl group of thr83* and the ca atom of
plp–glycine intermediate are in direct van der waals contact
(3.9 å) with each other. amino acids other than glycine could
theoretically bind only if their side chains face away from
thr83*. this would, however, block the binding site of scoa,
indicating that thr83* is pivotal in governing the specificity
of alas for glycine. in aons thr83* is replaced by a serine
(alexeev et al, 1998), which lacks the terminal methyl
group. alanine, larger by exactly this methyl group, is
hence the favored substrate of aons. accordingly, alas
may be modified to accept threonine (and to a lesser extent
serine, alanine and glycine) by engineering the replacement
of thr83 by serine, as shown for alas from r. sphaeroides
(shoolingin-jordan et al, 2003).

induces  xxxg123xxx  (see below), confirming its crucial participation in substrate binding.
we observe that scoa binds in the absence of glycine,
indicating that binding is initiated by 30 -phosphate adenosine
recognition. only upon glycine binding would the succinylpantetheine ‘tail’, however, fill the remaining channel. the

underscores these conclusions, as the optimal chain length is
clearly dictated by the successful positioning of cs1 opposite
glycine-ca following succinyl carboxylate recognition at the
far end of the channel. this also explains why increasing the
acyl-group hydrophilicity by substituting the carboxylate
by carbonyl, hydroxyl, or methyl groups should negatively
influence enzymatic activity. tight binding of the succinyl

carboxylate group furthermore slows the release of ala,
making it the rate-limiting step in the alas-catalyzed
reaction (hunter and ferreira, 1999b).
modeling human ealas on alas from r. capsulatus
before the present crystal structure of alas from r. capsulatus, structural information on alas was available only for
the 49 amino-acid presequence of murine alas from an nmr
study (goodfellow et al, 2001), and by modeling the catalytic
domain of alas on related enzymes such as aons (cheltsov
et al, 2003; shoolingin-jordan et al, 2003).
excluding the variable n-terminal regulatory and targeting
domain (140 residues; conboy et al, 1992), the catalytic core
of human ealas is 49% identical (70% similar) by sequence
to alasrc (figure 5a). this is a particularly high degree
of conservation between a human and bacterial protein,
and is significantly higher than the 29% between aons
and alasrc. the sequence similarity is uniformly distributed
throughout the length of 401 residues. it is, however, particularly pronounced in the active site, the active-site channel,
the monomer–monomer interface, and the protein core
(figure 5a). compared to alasrc, human ealas bears two
single-residue insertions and a single deletion in the first
40 residues of alasrc, in the least-conserved part of the
sequence. the high degree of amino-acid conservation and
the fact that the enzymatic activity of truncated human
ealas (km 2.6 mm glycine) is similar to that of alasrc
(2.8 mm), as well as alas from r. sphaeroides (5.8 mm),
indicate that the structure of alasrc represents a valid model
for human ealas.
mutations of ealas cause  xxxg123xxx 
hereditary sideroblastic anemia or  xxxg123xxx  is caused by point
mutations in  xxxg123xxx . in total, 42 such substitutions affecting
37 residues of human ealas have been identified (table ii;
reviewed by bottomley, 2004). some of these cases have been
successfully treated by supplemental pyridoxine ( xxxd3049xxx ,
converted to plp on uptake), phlebotomy (bleeding), or ironchelating drugs. the success of treatment, however, varies
especially due to the differential responsiveness of mutated
ealas patients to pyridoxine. the fact that many of the
 xxxg123xxx -sensitive residues of ealas are either strictly conserved
in alasrc or replaced by similar residues (table ii, columns 1
and 2) now permits the precise location of these mutation
sites to be mapped and analyzed (figure 5b).
in our discussion of the mutations, we have assigned four
groups of  xxxg123xxx  mutations depending on their proximity to
the active site.
 xxxg123xxx  mutations directly involved in substrate or plp binding
(magenta in figure 5a and b and table ii)
r517c: arg517 (arg374 in alasrc) engages the substrate
glycine carboxylate group in a salt bridge, and is thus crucial
for substrate recognition and discrimination (see above; tan
et al, 1998). replacing arginine by shorter, uncharged cysteine would severely reduce the substrate specificity. this
effect cannot be corrected by higher concentrations of plp,
hence confirming the observation that individuals carrying
this mutation do not respond to pyridoxine therapy.
t388s: thr388 (thr245) is part of the plp recognition
pattern by hydrogen bonding the plp phosphate. replacing
threonine by serine allows for higher rotational freedom of
& 2005 european molecular biology organization

serine, significantly reducing the affinity of ealas for plp.
a lower affinity for plp may be offset by increasing its
concentration. correspondingly, patients respond favorably
to pyridoxine treatment.
t508s: thr508 (thr365) is central to the function of alas.
it appears essential both for active-site closure (see above)
and in stabilizing scoa. this stabilization involves hydrophobic interactions to the succinyl-moiety and a hydrogen
bond to the succinyl-carboxylate group. removing the methyl
group by replacing threonine by serine would impair the
balance of interactions in the active site. in particular, conformational constraint on the succinyl-moiety of scoa would
be lost, affecting the position of atom cs1 of scoa, the atom
that attacks the deprotonated ca of the plp–glycine aldimine.
the lower affinity for scoa cannot be counteracted by an
increase in the amount of plp. correspondingly, this mutation is not convincingly pyridoxine responsive in patients.
k299q: lys299 (lys156), located on the surface of alas,
binds the o30 atom of scoa (ribose moiety) through a
hydrogen bond. replacing lysine by glutamine causes this
interaction to be lost, decreasing the binding affinity of
ealas for scoa. patients with this mutation are reported to
respond to pyridoxine treatment (table ii). however, as plp
binding in alas is not affected by the mutation, the effect of
pyridoxine supplementation may be indirect.
y506 frame shift and r204 stop: two mutations cause the
polypeptide to be terminated prematurely. termination at
position 204 (61) removes the major part of the catalytic
domain, while a frame shift after position 506 (363) leads,
at the very least, to the loss of arg517 (arg374), required
for glycine binding. both polypeptides will thus not give rise
to a functional enzyme, and increasing the concentration of
plp will not rescue their activity.
 xxxg123xxx  mutations indirectly affecting cofactor or ligand binding
(orange in figure 5a and b and table ii). the following
 xxxg123xxx  mutations involve residues not directly in contact with
the substrates glycine and scoa, nor with plp. they are,
however, located within the core of the alas monomer,
frequently in the immediate structural vicinity of the active
site. replacing them with physically incompatible residues
upsets the active site or the binding affinity of cofactor or
substrates.
f165l: phe165 (phe23) structurally stabilizes the neighboring arg163 (arg21, figure 2), required for scoa carboxylate group recognition, through hydrophobic interactions. replacing phe165 by leucine destabilizes arg163,
reducing the specificity of scoa binding. as plp binding
is not affected by the mutation, response to pyridoxine
treatment is marginal.
c276w: cys276 (leu133) is located at the n-terminal end
of b-strand b5 (figure 5a), filling a small hydrophobic
pocket. it is physically linked to residues ser280 (ser137)
and asp281 (asp138) involved in recognition of the scoa
adenine moiety. replacing this residue with the much bulkier
tryptophan will severely reduce scoa binding. as plp binding is not affected, patients are not responsive to pyridoxine
supplementation.
g291s: gly291 (gly148) is intermediate to ile289 (ile146)
and ile292 (ile149), both part of the scoa adenine-binding
pocket. replacing glycine by serine will upset the pocket,
decreasing the affinity for scoa. furthermore, gly291 is one

helical turn away from his285 (his142) involved in plp
binding (figure 2). disruption of a-helix a5 will thus affect
plp binding as well. as a result, this mutation may be
counteracted by increasing levels of plp.
c395y: cys395 (val252) is spatially immediately adjacent
to leu389 (leu246), which in turn is located sequentially
between thr388 (thr245) and lys391 (lys248), respectively,
3174 the embo journal vol 24 | no 18 | 2005

involved in plp–phosphate binding and in catalysis.
replacing cys395 by significantly larger tyrosine will
adversely affect plp binding. correspondingly, the activity
of this mutant enzyme may be rescued by higher concentrations of plp.
g398d: gly398 (gly255) is wedged in between cys258
(a115) and thr388 (th245), itself involved in an  xxxg123xxx

mutation and involved in plp–phosphate binding. adding a
side chain by mutation to aspartate will sterically disrupt this
pocket. by additionally introducing a negative charge, the
negative phosphate will no longer bind. correspondingly,
pyridoxine treatment is ineffectual in this case.
i476n: the side chain of ile476 (val333) stabilizes that
of his360 (his217), involved in plp binding, and arg517
(arg374), required for glycine recognition. replacing this
residue by asparagine will thus likely affect both plp
and glycine binding. patients with this mutation therefore
respond well to pyridoxine.
y199h: like ile476 (val333), above, tyr199 (tyr56) stabilizes his360 and arg517, as well as the catalytic lys391
(lys248) and asn197 (asn54), involved in glycine binding.
replacing tyrosine by histidine, though frequently a tolerable
mutation, appears to destabilize plp and glycine binding
sufficiently, so that elevated intracellular levels of plp only
partially offset the mutation.
r227c: arg227 (arg84), located in the glycine-rich stretch
and immediately adjacent to thr226 (thr83), itself involved
in substrate glycine and scoa carboxylate binding, is stabilized by a buried salt bridge to glu240 (glu97). replacing
arg227 by cysteine abrogates this ionic interaction.
apparently, this destabilizes the active site to such an extent
that plp supplementation proves ineffectual.
g416d: gly416 (gly273) is one a-helical turn removed
and thus physically adjacent to phe419 (phe276), which
is crucial for interaction with the pantetheine moiety of
coa. gly416 is also physically close to thr420 (ser277) and
thr421 (thr278), both of which bind the plp–phosphate.
substitution of gly416 by aspartate would hence disrupt
both plp and scoa binding. surprisingly, the disruption
is not severe, as plp does impart a moderate improvement
in alas activity.
buried  xxxg123xxx  mutations physically distant from the active site
(green in figure 5a and b and table ii). five mutational sites
(accounting for eight described mutations) are quite distant
with respect to the active site-, cofactor-, and substratebinding pockets. here, the influence of a substitution is less
direct. instead, a local change may radiate throughout the
structure, influencing protein stability, substrate-binding affinity, or enzymatic catalysis. buried residues are particularly
sensitive in this regard, normally permitting only conservative substitutions if complete destabilization and hence
inactivation is to be prevented.
due to the large number of mutations, the indirect effect of
the mutations, and hence the partly speculative nature of the
structural explanation, the discussion of these mutations is
provided in the supplementary data.
 xxxg123xxx  mutations on the protein surface (highlighted in blue
in figure 5a and b and table ii). in all, 16 mutations affect
the 12 separate surface-exposed residues in alas not located
near the active-site channel. these residues are exposed to
the surrounding aqueous medium and thus tend to be
hydrophilic. replacing them with hydrophobic residues or
by a residue of opposite charge will generally not directly
affect the binding of substrates or of cofactors. instead, they
may lead to protein destabilization and/or aggregation,
affecting the amount of protein available to produce ala.
alternatively, surface-exposed residues may affect the inter& 2005 european molecular biology organization

action of alas with other proteins. alas has, for example,
previously been reported to bind the b-subunit of atpspecific scoa synthetase, the enzyme that generates scoa
for ealas (furuyama and sassa, 2000). the replacement of
asp190 by valine, an  xxxg123xxx -inducing mutant (table ii), was
shown to prevent this interaction. at least six further mutations, affecting four positively charged amino acids (r436w,
r448q, r452c/h/s, r458h), cluster near asp190, indicating
that they, too, may induce  xxxg123xxx  by inhibiting the interaction
of ealas with scoa synthatase.
the detailed discussion of each individual mutation is
provided as supplementary data to this publication.
conclusions
the structure of alas from r. capsulatus is the first structure
of this essential enzyme from tetrapyrrole biosynthesis.
coincidentally thus, the first enzyme required for heme
biosynthesis in humans, animals, and a-proteobacteria is
the last to be elucidated structurally. the high degree of
conservation of this enzyme from bacteria to humans underlines the importance of this enzyme, the low evolutionary
tolerance of changes, and allows a surprisingly detailed view
of human ealas. this will aid the understanding of the
disease and allow the efficacy of pyridoxine treatment to be
rationalized. it may furthermore allow sufferers of the disease
and medical personnel involved in its treatment to lift the
veil of uncertainty by providing firm structural evidence to
understand the physical basis for the symptoms.

materials and methods
cloning, production, and purification of alas from
r. capsulatus, activity assay
the hema gene of r. capsulatus (dsm 1710) was amplified from
genomic dna using pcr and cloned into the bamhi/hindiii sites of
the escherichia coli expression vector pqe30 (qiagen). the protein
was produced in e. coli m15 (prep4) (qiagen) cells at 201c in tb
medium after induction with 0.1 mm isopropylthio-b-d-galactoside.
cells were harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by french press,
and the insoluble membrane and cell wall fraction were discarded
following centrifugation. alasrc was isolated from the soluble
fraction by ni-nta affinity chromatography (ni-nta agarose,
qiagen), followed by anion exchange chromatography (monoq,
amersham biosciences) and gel filtration (superdex 200, amersham biosciences). the purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/
ml. protein integrity and purity were verified using sds–page,
n-terminal sequencing, dynamic light scattering, and mass-spectrometric analysis.
the human  xxxg123xxx  gene encoding ealas was amplified by
pcr to yield a truncated (135 amino acids n-terminal and 34 amino
acids at the c-terminus) and n-terminally his-tagged protein.
expression and purification procedures were as described for the
alasrc.
enzymatic activity was analyzed by spectrophotometrically
monitoring the increase of nadh (l ¼ 340 nm) produced by
a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase during the regeneration of scoa
consumed by alas (hunter and ferreira, 1995).
crystallization
alasrc was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 201c
under anaerobic conditions (macs1000 anaerobic workbench,
don whitley scientific). in all, 2 ml of protein in 20 mm hepes,
ph 7.3, 200 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt, and 1 mm plp was added to 2 ml
of reservoir solution containing 100 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 200 mm
na acetate, 8% isopropanol (v/v), and 20% peg 4000. rectangular
crystals grew to a size of 50  50  50 mm3 within 2 weeks. the
crystals belong to space group p212121 with cell constants
a ¼ 67.3 å, b ¼ 90.6 å, and c ¼ 245.6 å. a matthews coefficient
of 2.24 å3/da indicated the presence of two alas dimers per

asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 44%
(matthews, 1968). for the substrate-bound structures, glycine or
scoa sodium salt was added to the reservoir solution (final
concentration 10 mm) and the crystals were transferred into 4 ml
of this solution and soaked for 24 h.
data collection and structure determination
x-ray diffraction data of substrate-free and substrate-soaked crystals
were, respectively, collected at the beamline bw6 (desy, hamburg)
and beamline bl1 (bessy ii, berlin). data were processed and
scaled using the hkl suite (otwinowski and minor, 1997). all
further steps were performed using programs of the ccp4 suite
(ccp4, 1994). the superimposed structures of aons (pdb code
1bs0; alexeev et al, 1998) and kbl (pdb code 1fc4; schmidt et al,
2001) were used as a model for molecular replacement in epmr
(kissinger et al, 1999). cns (brunger et al, 1998) was used for the
rigid-body and simulated-annealing refinement of all three structures. refmac5 was used for subsequent refinement, including
ncs-restraint and tls-refinement protocols (murshudov et al,
1997). the program o was used for manual model building
and structural analysis (jones et al, 1991). structures were validated
using procheck (laskowski et al, 1993) and what if (vriend,
1990). molecular depictions were prepared using pymol (delano,

2002). sequence alignments were performed with clustalw
(thompson et al, 1994), structure-based sequence alignments using
dali (holm and sander, 1996).
accession number
the coordinates of the structures have been deposited in the protein
data bank (code 2bwn, 2bwo and 2bwp).
