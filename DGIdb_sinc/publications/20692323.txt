the neurodevelopmental disorder angelman syndrome is most frequently caused by deletion of the
maternally derived chromosome 15q11-q13 region, which includes not only the causative ube3a gene,
but also the ␤3 -␣5 -␥3 gabaa receptor subunit gene cluster. gabaergic dysfunction has been hypothesized
to contribute to the occurrence of epilepsy and cognitive and behavioral impairments in this condition.
in the present study, analysis of gabaa receptor subunit expression and pharmacology was performed in
cerebral cortex from four subjects with angelman syndrome and compared to that from control tissue. the
membrane fraction of frozen postmortem neocortical tissue was isolated and subjected to quantitative
western blot analysis. the ratios of ␤3 /␤2 and ␣5 /␣1 subunit protein expression in angelman syndrome
cortex were signiﬁcantly decreased when compared with controls. an additional membrane fraction
was injected into xenopus oocytes, resulting in incorporation of the brain membrane vesicles with their
associated receptors into the oocyte cellular membrane. two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis of gabaa
receptor currents was then performed. studies of gabaa receptor pharmacology in angelman syndrome
cortex revealed increased current enhancement by the ␣1 -selective benzodiazepine-site agonist zolpidem and by the barbiturate phenobarbital, while sensitivity to current inhibition by zinc was decreased.
gabaa receptor afﬁnity and modulation by neurosteroids were unchanged. this shift in gabaa receptor
subunit expression and pharmacology in angelman syndrome is consistent with impaired extrasynaptic
but intact to augmented synaptic cortical gabaergic inhibition, which could contribute to the epileptic,
behavioral, and cognitive phenotypes of the disorder.

angelman syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of microcephaly, mental retardation, speech impairment,
ataxia, epilepsy, and an apparently happy and excitable demeanor
[34]. the cause of the condition is the loss of expression of the
maternal copy of the imprinted gene ube3a (ubiquitin protein
ligase e3a), either through deletion of the maternally inherited
chromosome 15q11-13 region (70%), paternal uniparental disomy
(2–5%), an imprinting defect (5%), or ube3a mutation (5–10%) [18].
epilepsy is extraordinarily common in angelman syndrome, developing in up to 90% of those with the condition [24,31].
the gabaa receptor is a ligand-gated heteropentameric chloride channel whose activation causes membrane hyperpolarization
and decreased neuronal excitability. in addition to the traditional
“phasic” form of fast inhibition mediated by synaptic gabaa receptors, primarily of the ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 composition in cortex, “tonic” gabaa
currents also serve to regulate neuronal excitability. the tonic

gabaa current is a continuous inhibitory current mediated by
high-afﬁnity, extrasynaptic receptors that are activated by ambient
levels of gaba, and in the neocortex is expected to be mediated primarily by receptors of the ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 and ␣4 ␤2 ␦ subunit compositions
[7].
the potential involvement of gabaa receptors in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in angelman syndrome has been suggested by
multiple factors. first, the most common cause of angelman syndrome, deletion of the maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-13
region containing the imprinted ube3a gene, also results in deletion of the non-imprinted gabaa ␤3 , ␣5 , and ␥3 subunit genes [18].
second, multiple studies have demonstrated that individuals with
angelman syndrome due to 15q11-13 deletion have more severe
epilepsy than those with uniparental disomy, imprinting defects,
or ube3a mutations, all of which would be expected to spare the
gabaa subunit genes [20]. a ﬁnal line of evidence has come from
studies of gabaa ␤3 subunit knockout mice, which demonstrate
high voltage eeg slowing and spontaneous myoclonic and clonic
seizures [5,9].
despite the hypothesized dysfunction of the gabaergic
inhibitory system in angelman syndrome, very few studies have
been done in human brain tissue to directly address this question. a

postmortem study revealed unchanged gaba levels in the cerebral
cortex of an individual with angelman syndrome as compared with
control tissues [15]. analysis of gabaa benzodiazepine receptor
binding by positron emission tomography scanning of individuals
with angelman syndrome has produced divergent results, indicating either decreased [11,22] or increased [1] binding levels.
finally, a decrease in gabaa ␤3 subunit mrna and protein expression in angelman cortex has been reported, although expression of
other gabaa receptor subunits and functional consequences of this
reduction were not determined [10,29]. in the present study, we
analyzed protein expression levels of several critical gabaa receptor subunits in human angelman syndrome and control cortex, and
then assessed the pharmacologic properties associated with the
detected alterations. to do this, we utilized a unique experimental
paradigm that allows electrophysiological analysis of ion channels
derived from frozen postmortem tissues.
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gabaa receptor subunits
␣5 and ␤3 were obtained from novus biologicals, rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against the ␤2 subunit were from abcam, and mouse
monoclonal ␣1 subunit antibody was from millipore. other details
regarding these antibodies are provided in supplemental table 1.
frozen cortical tissue specimens (100–200 mg) were processed to
isolate the membrane fraction and subjected to western blot analysis as detailed in [14]. infrared ﬂuorescence was used for signal
detection and quantitation (odyssey infrared imaging system, licor biosciences).
membrane isolation from an additional portion (50–300 mg) of
each frozen cortical specimen was performed using the method of
[19], with modiﬁcations, as detailed in [13]. xenopus laevis oocyte
collection and injection procedures were as described previously
[13].
injected oocytes (1–3 days after injection) were placed in a
recording chamber and bathed in oocyte ringer’s solution containing (in mm) nacl 82.5, kcl 2.5, cacl2 2.5, mgcl2 1, and hepes 5 (ph
7.4). two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were made at room
temperature using electrodes with a resistance of 0.5–2.5 m ﬁlled
with 3 mm kcl. oocyte membrane potential was held at −80 mv.
solutions were applied using a gravity-driven, valve-controlled
perfusion system.
graphing and curve-ﬁtting were carried out using excel
(microsoft) and originpro 8 software (originlab corporation).
statistical analysis was performed using originpro 8 and instat
(graphpad software).
frozen postmortem human cortical tissue was acquired from
the nichd brain and tissue bank for developmental disorders at
the university of maryland. although there are many limitations
inherent to the use of postmortem tissue, in this and our previous studies [14], gabaa receptor subunit protein expression and
pharmacologic properties were not correlated with postmortem
interval (data not shown). four samples were obtained from individuals with angelman syndrome and were analyzed along with
four age-matched control specimens obtained from individuals
with non-neurologic causes of death. supplemental table 2 lists
basic clinical details for each specimen. all angelman syndrome
patients were noted to have epilepsy and cognitive impairment.
chromosome 15q11-q13 deletion was identiﬁed in angelman
cases 1, 3, and 4; genetic information was not available for case 2.
medications at time of death were available for case 1 (clorazepate)
and case 2 (topiramate and clonazepam) only.
the expression levels of several gabaa receptor subunits
were analyzed by quantitative western blotting of cortical membranes isolated from the angelman and control autopsy specimens.
selected for analysis were the ␤3 and ␣5 subunits, which contribute
to cortical extrasynaptic ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 gabaa receptors [3,21] and are
deleted from the maternal 15q11-q13 region along with the ube3a
gene in the majority of angelman syndrome cases. also analyzed

were the ␤2 and ␣1 subunits, which contribute to cortical synaptic gabaa receptors, most of which are of the ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 composition
[3,21]. expression of the ␥3 subunit, which is also usually heterozygously deleted in angelman cases, was not assessed as this subunit
is present at extremely low levels in human cortex [23]. as shown
in a representative western blot (fig. 1a) and graphs summarizing
subunit expression levels relative to ␤-tubulin (fig. 1b), expres-

sion of the ␤3 subunit was not substantially altered in the cortical
specimens obtained from the individuals with angelman syndrome
as compared with the controls. in contrast, expression of the ␤2
subunit was markedly elevated.  xxxg834xxx  subunit expression was
reduced in the angelman syndrome samples, while levels of the ␣1
subunit were unchanged. as a result of these alterations, the ratio
of ␤3 to ␤2 subunit expression, as well as the ratio of ␣5 to ␣1 , was
signiﬁcantly reduced in angelman syndrome cortex as compared
with age-matched control cortex (fig. 1c). this indicates a relative deﬁcit in expression of protein subunits that make up cortical
extrasynaptic ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 gabaa receptors in angelman syndrome as
compared with the subunits that compose cortical synaptic ␣1 ␤2 ␥2
gabaa receptors.
the alterations of cortical gabaa receptor subunit expression
in angelman syndrome detected above predict several pharmacologic changes. to investigate this, we utilized the technique of
injection of brain cellular membrane preparations into the xenopus oocyte, which results in the “microtransplantation” of human
gabaa receptors in their native conﬁguration into the oocyte
plasma membrane [19]. with this method, the appearance of receptor currents does not depend on mrna translation, but instead

arises from incorporation into the oocyte membrane of the injected
membrane vesicles harboring native receptors. this allows analysis
by standard two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. the
advantages and limitations of this technique are discussed in detail
elsewhere [13]. of particular note, absolute current amplitudes
measured using this method do not accurately reﬂect those present
in the source tissue; rather, this technique is ideal for determining
relative receptor responses to pharmacologic manipulations [19].
gaba dose–response curves were generated from oocytes
expressing receptors from control and angelman syndrome cortex (fig. 2a). although there was a trend towards higher
gabaa receptor afﬁnity in the angelman specimens, the differences in half-maximal effective gaba concentration (ec50) did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance (control = 96.4 ± 10.4 ␮m, angelman = 69.0 ± 7.8 ␮m, p > 0.05). we next assessed responses to
exogenous and endogenous agents known to modulate gabaa currents. zolpidem is a benzodiazepine-site agonist with selectivity
for ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 receptors that is used clinically in the treatment of
insomnia. in contrast, diazepam is a non-selective benzodiazepine
used in the treatment of seizures and anxiety which acts equally
on ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 and ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 receptors. gabaa current enhancement by

control.

zolpidem was signiﬁcantly increased in angelman syndrome cortex as compared with controls (fig. 2b and c), while enhancement
by diazepam was equivalent (fig. 2d). gabaa receptor current is
directly inhibited by endogenous zinc, which acts with low afﬁnity
on synaptic ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 receptors and with higher afﬁnity on extrasynaptic ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 receptors [4]. the degree of gabaa receptor current
inhibition by zinc was signiﬁcantly less in angelman syndrome cortex than in control cortex (fig. 3a and b). these pharmacologic
ﬁndings are consistent with a relative predominance of synaptic
␣1 ␤2 ␥2 receptors over extrasynaptic ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 receptors in angelman syndrome, as suggested by the protein expression studies
above.
we next analyzed responses to the barbiturate phenobarbital and the endogenous neurosteroid 5␣-pregnan-3␣-ol-20-one
(5␣3␣), both of which enhance gabaa receptor currents and function as anticonvulsant and sedative agents. based on studies of
recombinant receptors, these agents should act with similar efﬁcacy on synaptic ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 and extrasynaptic ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 combinations
[2,32]. interestingly, current augmentation by phenobarbital was
substantially larger in angelman syndrome cortex as compared
with control cortex (fig. 3c and d). in contrast, there was no
difference in the degree of gabaa current potentiation by the
neurosteroid 5␣3␣ (supplemental fig. 1). unfortunately, none of
the currently available gabaa receptor agonists or antagonists are
able to discriminate between ␤2 and ␤3 -subunit containing receptors [8], so the relative prevalence of these subtypes could not be
directly assessed pharmacologically.

the present study represents the ﬁrst to systematically analyze
gabaa receptor subunit expression and pharmacology in human
angelman syndrome cortex. this is despite the frequently stated
hypothesis that reduced gabaa receptor function is a prominent
mechanism contributing to the development of epilepsy and cognitive impairment in the disorder. our study has demonstrated that
gabaa ␤3 /␤2 and ␣5 /␣1 subunit expression ratios are decreased in
angelman syndrome cortex as compared with age-matched control
cortex. these reductions predict relative impairment of inhibition by extrasynaptic gabaa ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 receptors, but unchanged to
increased inhibitory function by synaptic gabaa ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 receptors.
these alterations in subunit expression patterns were accompanied
by changes in receptor pharmacology, with increased efﬁcacy of the
␣1 -selective benzodiazepine-site agonist zolpidem, and decreased
efﬁcacy of zinc, which acts preferentially on ␣5 ␤3 ␥2 as compared
with ␣1 ␤2 ␥2 receptors. gabaa current enhancement by phenobarbital, which acts equally on all receptor subunit combinations, was
substantially increased, while that of the neurosteroid 5␣3␣ was
unchanged.
based on the heterozygous deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13,
including the non-imprinted gabaa ␤3 -␣5 -␥3 gene cluster, one
would predict a 50% reduction in ␤3 expression and no change
in ␤2 , which is located on chromosome 5q in a cluster with the
␣6 -␣1 -␥2 subunit genes. instead, what we found was a marked
increase in ␤2 expression with no signiﬁcant change in ␤3 expression. we feel the most likely explanation for this ﬁnding is that
expression of both ␤2 and ␤3 subunits have been reported to be

w.h. roden et al. / neuroscience letters 483 (2010) 167–172

elevated in temporal lobe epilepsy patients, possibly as a consequence of repeated seizures [25]. in angelman syndrome patients,
this would predominantly be manifested as ␤2 elevation, given
underlying deﬁcits in ␤3 expression. other possible explanations
include effects of antiepileptic drugs [27] or compensatory overexpression of ␤2 during development in the setting of relative ␤3
deﬁciency, similar to that observed in ␣1 subunit knockout mice
[16].
the demonstrated alterations in angelman syndrome patients
would be predicted to have complex clinical effects, due to the
divergent functions of ␤3 - and ␤2 -containing gabaa receptors in
the brain. receptors containing ␤3 subunits seem to be primarily responsible for mediation of the anesthetic effects of gabaa
receptor agonists, while those containing ␤2 subunits mediate the
sedative effects of these agents [28]. the anticonvulsant effects
of non-selective gabaa agonists are mediated by both ␤3 - and
␤2 -containing receptors [6]. this would predict that administration of non-selective gabaa agonists to individuals with angelman
syndrome would have reduced anesthetic effects but unchanged
to enhanced sedative and anticonvulsant effects. in keeping with
this hypothesis, benzodiazepine medications are among the most
commonly prescribed to individuals with angelman syndrome and
epilepsy, and are found to be efﬁcacious and well-tolerated [31].
in addition, our results suggest that those affected by angelman
syndrome may be more sensitive to gabaergic agents used to
treat insomnia. it is interesting to consider the clinical implications
of our results for phenobarbital, which demonstrated considerably increased current enhancement in angelman syndrome
cortex as compared with control cortex. phenobarbital is commonly prescribed for the management of epilepsy in angelman
syndrome, although reports have indicated limited effectiveness
in monotherapy [31,33]. in addition, phenobarbital exhibits an
adverse side effect proﬁle including lethargy, which individuals
with angelman syndrome may be more sensitive to given our ﬁndings.
comparison of our results to those found in gabaa ␤3 homozygous or heterozygous knockout mice, a purported model of
angelman syndrome, reveals both similarities and areas of divergence. the heterozygous condition would be expected to be
more analogous to the human disorder. homozygous ␤3 knockout
mice exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced gabaa and benzodiazepine
receptor binding, markedly decreased current amplitudes, and
unchanged to increased gaba afﬁnity, while heterozygotes had
unchanged to slightly decreased gabaa and benzodiazepine receptor binding, unchanged to minor decreases in current amplitudes,
and no change in gaba afﬁnity [12,17,30]. our current study on
human angelman cortex also identiﬁed no change in gaba afﬁnity
or modulation by the benzodiazepine diazepam. studies in cultured
cortical neurons from homozygous ␤3 knockout mice revealed no
change in ␣1 subunit expression and increased current potentiation by zolpidem [26], similar to what we have found in the present
study using human tissue.
in conclusion, our studies of gabaa receptor subunit expression and pharmacology in angelman syndrome reveal alterations
that predict impairment of cortical extrasynaptic, but unchanged
to enhanced synaptic, gabaergic activity. while these changes
are unlikely to explain the development of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairments in this disorder, they may modify
their characteristics and responsiveness to gabaergic medications.
