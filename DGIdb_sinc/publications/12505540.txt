abstract
benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of maternal psychiatric disorders during pregnancy.
besides their anxiolytic effect, they are reported to exert a direct relaxing action on several smooth muscle
preparations, including the uterus. in the present study, the possibility of the involvement of a1-adrenergic
receptors in this peripheral effect is investigated. the tocolytic potencies of diazepam, midazolam and nitrazepam
are assessed in vivo in a postpartum rat model, together with other drugs known to bind to a-adrenoceptors (e.g.
a1-antagonists, tricyclic compounds and  xxxd1945xxx ). the interactions of some benzodiazepines and
norepinephrine were also examined in an isolated in vitro system. the affinities of these agents for the receptor
in question were additionally tested by radioligand displacement assay. a correlation was found between the
tocolytic potencies and inhibition constants of the tested drugs, suggesting that the smooth muscle-relaxing effect
of these benzodiazepines is mediated through modulation of the a1-adrenergic receptors.

introduction
as a high proportion of neonatal mortalities can be attributed to premature delivery (birth before 37
completed weeks), drug treatment for the prevention of early uterine contraction is essential. the
authorized medication for tocolytic purposes includes h2-sympathomimetics (e.g.  xxxd2098xxx ),  xxxd2534xxx  and

rarely nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (e.g. indomethacin). despite the widespread use of these
agents, the frequency of early labor does not seem to decline. this failure highlights the need for a search
for newer tocolytics with better efficacy and/or a more tolerable side-effect profile. we earlier reported
that the adrenergic receptor status (the density ratio of a1/h-adrenoceptors) correlates with the
spontaneous motor activity of the postpartum rat model. moreover, a1-adrenergic antagonists (e.g.
 xxxd3000xxx ) exerted a substantial inhibitory effect on the myometrial activity, suggesting that the members
of this pharmacological group are also potentially tocolytics [1,2].
benzodiazepines are often used during pregnancy for maternal psychiatric indications (e.g. anxiety or
panic disorder), but opinions concerning their safety are divided. some authors argue for the use of these
drugs, citing no obstetrical complications or neonatal toxicity attributed to intrauterine exposure [3,4],
whereas others mention possible congenital malformations as consequences [5,6]. in view of these
contradictory findings, a compromise appears to be required, such that benzodiazepine therapy may be
justified when its expected benefits exceed the risk.
on the other hand, the well-documented smooth muscle-relaxant effect of benzodiazepines has
recently been attributed to a modulatory action on a1-adrenergic receptors [7,8]. such experimental data
permit the conclusion that, besides their central action, these psychoactive drugs possibly exert a direct
tocolytic effect on a-adrenoceptors. the present study is devoted to an investigation of this theory by
comparing the affinity for a1-receptors assessed in vitro, and the tocolytic potency, measured in vivo, in
a postpartum rat model. the affinity of phenothiazines and structurally related tricyclic compounds (e.g.
typical antidepressants) for a1-adrenergic receptors is well accepted. for further elucidation of the
possible direct connection of a1-adrenergic blocking activity and tocolytic action, we have extended our
experiments to some of these compounds (promethazine, clomipramine and  xxxd1945xxx ); a number of
specific a1-blockers were also included. to exclude other possible sites of action than a1-adrenergic
receptors (e.g. calcium channels), two representative benzodiazepines (diazepam and nitrazepam) were
chosen as subjects of an in vitro investigation of the effects of these drugs on norepinephrine-induced
contraction.

materials and methods
in vivo assessment of uterine activity
female sprague–dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane (1 g/kg, intraperitoneally) 24 h after
spontaneous delivery. after cannulation of the jugular vein, the abdominal cavity was opened and a
millar catheter fitted with a liquid-filled latex microballoon was inserted into the uterus through a small
section above the cervical part. after a 45-min equilibration period, the intrauterine pressure was
recorded (isosys data acquisition system, experimetria ltd., u.k.) and the effects of the administered
compounds were assessed by expressing the integrated tension relating to a 5-min period after each dose
as a percentage of the average for three 5-min periods before the first administration. all experimental
animal protocols satisfied the guidelines for animal experimentation approved by the animal
experimentation committee of the university of szeged. the ed50 values were individually calculated
by means of the computer program graphpad prism 2.01. statistical analyses were performed with the
unpaired student’s t–test to assay differences in ed50 values of benzodiazepines obtained without and
after flumazenil pretreatment.

radioligand displacement assay
the affinities of the tested drugs for a1-adrenergic receptors were measured on a postpartum rat
myometrial membrane preparation. the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 24 h after
delivery and the myometrial tissues were homogenized in 0.01 m tris–hcl-containing 0.25 m sucrose
solution. the homogenate was centrifuged at 20 000  g for 10 min and the resuspended pellet was
centrifuged under the same conditions. the supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 50 000  g for 60
min and the resuspended pellet was used in radioligand binding assays. the incubation system contained
100 al diluted membrane preparation (protein content approximately 0.5–1 mg/ml), 100 al 1.5 nm

[3h] xxxd3000xxx  and a 100 al sample of the tested compound (its concentration ranging from 10 9 m to
10 3 m). total and nonspecific binding were assessed in the absence of competitor (unlabeled
compound) and in the presence of 100 al 10 am  xxxd2914xxx , respectively. after incubation (at 25
jc for 45 min), the membranes were collected on a whatman gf/c filter, using a brandel m24 cell
harvester. the radioactivities of the filters were measured as described previously [2]. this set of
experiments was carried out in triplicate. displacement experiments were analyzed individually with the
computer program prism 2.01 to determine the inhibition constants (ki) of the investigated agents. the
dissociation constant (kd) and the density of myometrial a1-adrenergic receptors (bmax) were additionally determined, as described previously [2].
isolated organ experiments
this set of experiments was carried out by using isolated uterine rings of pregnant sprague–dawley
rats. the animals (250–350 g) mated in a special cage in the early morning; copulation was determined
by the presence of a copulation plug or sperm in a native vaginal smear. the day of conception was
considered to be the first day of pregnancy. on day 21 of pregnancy, the animals were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation and the uterine horns were explored. at the time of the in vivo experiment (i.e. 1 day
after delivery), the spontaneous myometrial activity is too high for agonist-induced investigations to be
performed. approximately 5-mm-long parts of the horns were mounted vertically in a 10-ml organ bath
containing de jongh solution (composition in mm: 137 nacl, 3 kcl, 1 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 12 nahco3, 4
nah2po4, 6 glucose, ph: 7.4). the solution was kept at 37 jc and a carbogen mixture (95% o2 + 5%
co2) was bubbled through it. the rings were equilibrated for 90 min and the initial tension was set to 1.5
g. the tension of the uterine tissues was measured with a gauge transducer (experimetria ltd., u.k.) and
recorded by means of the aforementioned isosys data acquisition system. the area under the curve
(auc value) relating to a 5-min period was used to decribe the uterine activity. the average of three

5-min periods before the first administration was taken as the basal value. norepinephrine doses were
added in 50 al in a cumulative way, either in the presence or in the absence of the tested benzodiazepines
and propranolol. the points of the concentration-response relatonships were compared by using anova
with dunnett’s multiple comparison test.
chemicals
the following drugs were diluted with physiological saline or the appropriate solvent in the case of
radioligand displacement assay: clomipramine and  xxxd2914xxx  (ciba – geigy ag, switzerland),
 xxxd1945xxx , midazolam and promethazine (egis, hungary), diazepam (gedeon richter, hungary),
clonazepam and flumazenil (hoffmann–la roche, switzerland),  xxxd3000xxx , norepinephrine, propranolol
and nitrazepam (sigma–aldrich ltd., hungary), urapidil (byk gulden, germany), bmy-7378 (research
biochemicals, usa) and benoxathian (a gift from prof. c. melchiorre, dept. of chemical sciences,
university of camerino, italy). the final solution of nitrazepam contained 13% dimethylsulfoxide, which
itself had no effect on the uterine motor activity. the radioligand [3h] xxxd3000xxx  was purchased from
amersham international (uk).

results
effects of the tested pharmacons on spontaneous uterine activity
diazepam, midazolam and nitrazepam exerted dose-related tocolytic activity on the postpartum rat
model. this effect could not be prevented by 0.1 mg/kg flumazenil given intravenously 5 min before the
first benzodiazepine administration. the gaba antagonist flumazenil itself had no own effect on the
uterine contractility in the concentration range 0.0125–0.4 mg/kg. clomipramine,  xxxd1945xxx  and
promethazine also inhibited the spontaneous motility of the preparation (fig. 1). clonazepam in the
dose range 0.05–0.8 mg/kg did not exert a relevant tocolytic effect, and higher doses were not tolerated

by the animals. the investigated a1-antagonists (benoxathian, bmy-7378,  xxxd2914xxx ,  xxxd3000xxx  and

affinities of the tested pharmacons for a1-adrenergic receptors
the affinities of the investigated benzodiazepines,  xxxd1945xxx , tricyclic compounds and a-blockers
were determined by displacement analyses on a postpartum rat myometrial membrane preparation. as
expected, clomipramine,  xxxd1945xxx  and promethazine displayed relatively high affinities, the five tested
a-blockers exhibited much higher affinities, headed by  xxxd3000xxx , and the benzodiazepines had
substantially higher ki values. the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not bind to the a1adrenoceptors even at extremely high concentration (10 3 m). the ki values of the tested compounds
are also listed in table 1. these inhibitory constants demonstrate that the tested benzodiazepines can not
be classified as specific ligands for the a1-receptors. the affinities of the previously mentioned specific
a1-adrenergic antagonists were also determined in this system. a correlation was found between the
affinities for the a1-receptors measured in vitro (expressed as log ki) and the tocolytic potency
(expressed as log ed50 values) observed in vivo (fig. 2). the kd and bmax values of the myometrial
a1 receptors were found to be 1.98 f 0.09 nm and 720 f 34.2 fmol/mg protein, respectively.
results of in vitro isolated experiments
in the absence of benzodiazepines and propranolol, norepinephrine resulted in a biphasic concentration-response relationship in the range 1  10 10 –1  10 5 m (fig. 3, upper panel). at lower
concentrations (1  10 10 –1  10 8 m), it increased the contractions of the myometrial rings as a
consequence of a-adrenergic receptor stimulation, while at higher concentrations a h-adrenergic effect
predominated, causing a continuous decrease in the integrated tension. at 3  10 6 –1  10 5 m
norepinephrine, the contractility of the isolated uteri was abolished. the increasing phase was
antagonized by both 1  10 5 m diazepam and 1  10 5 m nitrazepam; diazepam was the more
effective from this aspect. at higher concentration, neither benzodiazepine exerted a statistically
significant effect. for elucidation of the effects of the tested benzodiazepines on the a-adrenergic
receptors, the investigations were repeated in the presence of 1  10 5 m propranolol, where
norepinephrine resulted in a single-phase relationship culminating at 3  10 6 –1  10 5 m. this
gradual tension increase was antagonized by a fixed concentration (1  10 5 m) of both tested
benzodiazepines, especially at higher concentrations of norepinephrine (fig. 3, lower panel).

discussion
the uterus-relaxing effect of benzodiazepines was recognized relatively shortly after their introduction into therapy, suggesting a possible role of this class in the treatment of early labor [9]. these drugs
exert a direct uterotropic action, with a poorly understood mechanism. as benzodiazepine-binding sites
are present in the mammalian myometrium, it seems evident that these peripheral receptors are directly
involved in the relaxation of the uterus [10].
kazanietz and elgoyhen found that neither the central benzodiazepine antagonist ro 15-1788
(flumazenil) nor the gabaa antagonist bicucullin prevented the relaxant effect of diazepam on isolated
uterine rings of the rat, indicating that the involvement of classical or central benzodiazepine receptors
can be excluded [11]. moreover, the benzodiazepine concentration required for a tocolytic effect is
considerably higher than that needed for saturation of the central receptors [12]. all of these findings

1100

i. zupkó et al. / life sciences 72 (2003) 1093–1102

suggest the possible involvement of a peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptors. this theory was not
proved by the in vitro results of perez-guerrero et al.: the peripheral benzodiazepine antagonist pk
11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-n-methyl-n-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide] also failed to
antagonize the relaxant effect of tetrazepam on isolated uterine muscle of the rat [13]. this result was
reinforced, with the difference that pk 11195 not only failed to prevent the relaxant effect of
benzodiazepines, but itself proved to be similarly effective [14]. in the same set of experiments, the
direct cl -channel blocker dids [4,4v-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2v-disulfonic acid] had no effect on the
relaxation induced by benzodiazepines. in a previous study, no correlation was found between the
relaxant potencies of benzodiazepines assessed against electrically induced contractions and their
binding affinities [15].
all this information, together with the result that the benzodiazepine concentration needed for the
relaxant effect is much higher than that which saturates the peripheral receptors [16], allows the
speculation that this type of receptor also plays no role in the mediation of the investigated effect. the
physiological importance of these receptors thus remains unknown.
on the other hand, several theories have been published as possible explanations for the quite general
muscular effect of benzodiazepines, e.g. on other smooth muscle or even heart muscle preparations. most
of these publications tend to the final conclusion that these compounds can affect the intracellular ca2 +
concentration, possibly by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive ca2 + channel [16–18]. the currently available
benzodiazepine antagonists do not inhibit this action and this conclusion is not generally accepted.
gimeno et al. investigated the influence of peripheral benzodiazepine ligands on vascular smooth
muscle and concluded that their effects were not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors [19]. however,
all of the tested agents inhibited phosphodiesterase, which served as a possible explanation of the action.
the most recently postulated mechanism involves a blockade or modulatory inhibition of a-adrenergic
receptors. diazepam inhibited noradrenaline-provoked contractions of the isolated vas deferens of the rat,
and this effect was not affected by flumazenil or pk 11195 [20]. lorazepam and diazepam dosedependently decreased the phenylephrine-induced intracellular ca2 + oscillation in pulmonary artery
smooth muscle cells. as this oscillation is not dependent on voltage-gated ca2 + channels, these results
seem to disprove the theory that the effects of the benzodiazepines may be attributed to the blockade of
these channels [7]. competition binding studies directly indicate that benzodiazepines can modulate the
function of a1-adrenergic receptors. some benzodiazepine have recently been found to be weak partial
antagonists at a1-receptor subtypes. among the tested drugs, diazepam demonstrated a unique noncompetitive interaction with phenylephrine at the a1a subtype, leading to an irreversible decrease of the
functioning receptor population [8]. these published data are in good agreement with our results,
explaining that diazepam had a similar ed50 to those of the tricyclic drugs (clomipramin and
promethazine), while exhibiting a substantially lower affinity for the receptor in question. on the basis
of these data and the presented results, we conclude that this ‘‘antiadrenergic’’ property of benzodiazepines may decrease the myometrial activity when they are applied during pregnancy. our experiments
were extended to other psychopharmacons which are known to have considerable affinity for the a1adrenoceptors (clomipramine,  xxxd1945xxx  and chlorpromazine), in order to establish a more convincing
relationship between the tocolytic potency assessed in vivo and the affinity determined in vitro. these
three agents are also reported to have uterus-relaxant effects in vitro, with a not precisely defined
mechanism [21,22]. promethazine has even been authorized for this purpose.
the in vitro experiments carried out on isolated uterine rings revealed that diazepam and nitrazepam
are able to antagonize the stimulating effect of norepinephrine. as the h-adrenergic receptor-mediated

1101

relaxation predominated over the a-receptor-elicited contractions, the antagonistic effects were limited.
however, when the h-receptors were inhibited by propranolol, the antiadrenergic capacity of these agents
proved more convincing. as norepinephrine is a nonselective agonist, the a2-adrenergic receptors can not
be excluded as a potential site of action of benzodiazepines. unlike the a1-receptors, the a2 subtype was
not found to bind benzodiazepines, suggesting that the relaxant effect of these drugs should be attributed
to the a1-receptors. this conclusion is reinforced by the strong correlation (r2 = 0.853), which clearly
demonstrates that the a1-blocking property can result in tocolytic activity. this relationship, involving
five real a1-antagonists, interlinks the tocolytic potency and the affinity for the a1-adrenoceptor, assessed
in vivo and in vitro, respectively. it is obvious, however, that these psychopharmacons can not be regarded
as drugs of choice in the above-mentioned clinical situation, as their potencies are insufficiently low, i.e. at
the active concentration intensive central effects on both mother and fetus must be reckoned with. on the
other hand, when these drugs are used correctly to treat a maternal psychiatric disorder, the possible
uterus-relaxing or tocolysis-potentiating effect should be considered.
nevertheless, these results and the final conclusion drawn from them comprise a further argument for
the development of an a1-antagonist as a tocolytic agent.
