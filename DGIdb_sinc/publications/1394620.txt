summary

treatment of isolated mitochondria from rat hepatoma tumor cells (as-30d)
with the oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide (tbuooh, i or 5 ~mol/ml) resulted in the
oxidation of glutathione (gsh to  xxxd2811xxx ) and the formation of protein-glutathione
mixed disulfides (prossg). the  xxxd2811xxx  was retained inside of the hepatoma
mitochondria. in the presence of adp + succinate (5 or 10 mm), or
ketoglutarate (10 ram) or malate (5 mm), the  xxxd2811xxx  was reduced to gsh, but the
amount of prossg stayed constant. with saline or adp + glutamate (10
mm)/malate (0.1 mm) no reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh occurred. the presence of
antimycin (5 ~g/ml) with adp + succinate inhibited reduction. at a concentration of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-l-nitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx , 0.5 mm) which inhibited a
major portion of the  xxxg981xxx  activity, the reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  to
replenish gsh was also inhibited. nadph may play a critical role as well, for
the addition of 2.4 mm nadph to permeabilized hepatoma mitochondria
fostered the reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  after tbuooh treatment. therefore, hepatoma
mitochondria possess a  xxxg981xxx -dependent system to reduce  xxxd2811xxx 
to gsh. the reaction only occurs with actively respiring mitochondria.

introduction

glutathione (reduced, gsh; disulfide,  xxxd2811xxx ) in mitochondria was shown to be
the critical reductant important for liver cell viability after oxidative stress from
treatment with  xxxd2049xxx  [1]. therefore, monitoring the dynamics of gsh
in mitochondria should give an indication of the cellular effects of toxic agents.
earlier experiments showed that treatment of isolated rat liver mitochondria
with t-butyl hydroperoxide (tbuooh) resulted in oxidation of the gsh with little
effiux of  xxxd2811xxx  from the mitochondrial matrix [2]. not only was this  xxxd2811xxx 
reduced to gsh within 30 min, but the gsh was also released from the proteinglutathione mixed disulfide (prossg) which was formed by the tbuooh treatment. however, rat brain mitochondria require a 40-fold lower concentration of
tbuooh to oxidize the gsh [3]. in addition, oxidation resulted in prossg formation, with  xxxd2811xxx  accounting for only 5% of the total gsh. the oxidation of gsh
in brain mitochondria was irreversible, indicating a greater susceptibility to
oxidative stress.
thus, it has been demonstrated that treatment of isolated mitochondria can
result in different phenomena depending on the cellular origin of the mitochondria. there are numerous studies indicating that mitochondria from tumor cells
differ from normal cell mitochondria. these differences range from changes in
enzymatic activities [4,5], to a high capacity to accumulate and retain calcium
[6,7]. to understand better the relationship of mitochondrial gsh and oxidative
stress, we have utilized as-30d tumor cells to compare mitochondria from these
cells with the data from normal tissue mitochondria [2,3]. treatment of as-30d
mitochondria with tbuooh failed to induce the release of calcium seen in rat
liver mitochondria [4]. in this study [4], less oxidation of pyridine nucleotides occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria in comparison to liver mitochondria. the
insensitivity of the hepatoma mitochondria appears to depend on a nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent malic enzyme, not present in rat liver
mitochondria. this enzyme maintains pyridine nucleotides in the reduced form.
results from our laboratory indicate that hepatoma mitochondria also have
distinct characteristics for gsh homeostasis after oxidative stress. the as-30d
mitochondria resemble rat liver mitochondria with respect to the dose of
tbuooh required to oxidize gsh and the ability to reduce the  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh [2].
however, as in rat brain mitochondria [3], no recovery of prossg was seen in
the tumor mitochondria.
in liver mitochondria, peroxide-induced oxidation of nadph was shown to be
reversible in the presence of succinate [8]. by utilizing different substrates with
the hepatoma mitochondria, we have determined that succinate, malate and
ketoglutarate + adp support  xxxd2811xxx  reduction, while glutamate/malate + adp
was not sufficient. the addition of antimycin and 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-lnitrosourea ( xxxd444xxx ) inhibited  xxxd2811xxx  reduction. when the hepatoma mitochondria were permeabilized and treated with tbuooh, the addition of excess
nadph enhanced the ability of the mitochondria to reduce  xxxd2811xxx . our results
indicate that hepatoma mitochondria possess the ability to reduce  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh
and that this reaction only occurs with actively respiring mitochond/-ia.

methods

mitochondria were isolated, as described in moreadith and fiskum [10], from
as-30d cells grown 7 - 9 days i.p. in sprague-dawley rats. a solution of 0.15
m ammonium chloride, 0.01 m sodium bicarbonate and 0.001 m edta was utilized to lyse blood cells when needed. the isolated mitochondria were incubated in
210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.05% bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 0.5 mm
hepes (ph 7.2). the respiratory control ratio was measured polarographically
with a clark-type oxygen electrode (yellow springs instrument co., yellow
springs, oh) in a 3-ml thermostated chamber equipped with magnetic stirring.
the respiratory control ratio was determined at 37°c according to estabrook
[11] utilizing 1.2 mm potassium phosphate and 0.3 mm adp plus 5 or 10 mm succinate (suc), or 10 mm ketoglutarate, or 5 mm malate or 10 mm glutamate and
0.1 mm malate (glu, mal). these substrates were added prior to the oxidative
treatment. antimycin a (anti, 5 ~g/ml) was added at the same time as the
substrates. mitochondria were incubated for 30 min with  xxxd444xxx  (0.5 mm) before
oxidative treatment and gsh reductase activity was assayed as shown by
babson and reed [12].
t-butyl hydroperoxide (tbuooh, 1 and 5 ~mol/ml) was added at 0 time. at this
level of treatment, the mitochondria remain coupled. samples containing 3
mg/ml mitochondria protein were taken at 5,15 and 30 min (duplicate). gsh and
 xxxd2811xxx  were assayed in the mitochondria and media using the hplc method of
reed et al. [13]. protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (prossg) were analyzed
through the use of dithiothreitol and hplc as given by livesey and reed [14].
mitochondria were monitored for the non-specific permeability change by
observing the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm with an aminco dw 2000 spectrophotometer operated in a split beam mode [15,16] (fig. 4). gsh (0.5 mm) was
included in the incubation media with the mitochondria. after tbuooh (1 or 0.5
~mol/ml) treatment of the mitochondria, 80 ~m calcium chloride and 2.3 mm
potassium phosphate were added to induce the permeability change before the
addition of 2.4 mm nadph. controls included permeabilized mitochondria
without added nadph and samples with 2.4 mm nadph +  xxxg981xxx  (6 units/ml, sigma type iii) (not shown). samples were removed at the
indicated times and assayed for glutathione as described above.
results

gsh was oxidized to  xxxd2811xxx  in isolated hepatoma mitochondria with the addition of tbuooh (5 ~mol/ml, fig 1. or 1 ~mol/ml, not shown). daily variability
with respect to the sensitivity of the mitochondria to the tbuooh dosage may
have been related to the nutritional status of the tumor cells when removed from
the rats. different experiments followed different patterns of oxidation and
recovery, both with respect to time and extent of change. as in the rat liver
mitochondria [2], little or no  xxxd2811xxx  effluxed from the hepatoma mitochondria
after tbuooh treatment and the tbuooh dose necessary for oxidation was
similar. small amounts of gsh effluxed from the controls, but little or no gsh

effluxed from treated mitochondria, which was also similar to that observed in
rat liver and brain mitochondria [2,3].
murphy et al. [17] demonstrated in as-30d mitochondria that the rate of state
3 respiration in the presence of low calcium is similar for ketoglutarate and succinate, while the rate of respiration with glutamate/malate is reduced by 50%.
in our experiments, reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh was dependent upon the addition
of substrates for atp-generating respiration (state 3, coupled respiration).
mitochondria treated with tbuooh in saline (not shown) or glutamate (10
mm)/malate (0.1 mm) + adp (with coupled mitochondria) did not reduce the
 xxxd2811xxx  to gsh (fig. 1). but with adp + succinate (5 or 10 mm), or malate (5
mm) (not shown) or ketoglutarate (10 mm) (not shown) present during the
tbuooh treatment, reduction of the  xxxd2811xxx  did occur (fig. 1). inhibition of the
respiratory chain by the addition of antimycin (1 mm) with succinate + adp also
inhibited reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  in the tbuooh-treated mitochondria (not shown).
therefore, it appears that a threshold level of respiration in the mitochondria
was necessary to reduce  xxxd2811xxx .
protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (prossg) formed with tbuooh treatment (fig. 2). as in rat brain mitochondria [3], no decrease in prossg occurred
with either tbuooh treatment and 30 min incubation, with or without
substrates.
 xxxd2811xxx  is reduced to gsh by  xxxd2811xxx  reductase, which utilizes nadph for reducing equivalents.  xxxd444xxx  is a specific inhibitor of the  xxxd2811xxx  reductase [12]. when
66% of the  xxxd2811xxx  reductase activity of the isolated hepatoma mitochondria was
inhibited by  xxxd444xxx ,  xxxd2811xxx  formed by treatment with tbuooh (1 ~mol/ml) was
not reduced to gsh within 30 min (fig. 3).

fig. 4. influence of nadph on  xxxd2811xxx  reduction. gsh (0.5 mm) was added to mitochondria prior to
tbuooh (0.5 or 1 /~mol/ml). immediately following tbuooh oxidation, mitochondria were
permeabilized by the addition of calcium chloride and potassium phosphate and monitored as indicated in methods. nadph (2.4 mm) was added last when indicated. mitochondria and media were
sampled for glutathione. the total glutathione remained constant under all conditions during the
experiment. (five experiments x + s.e.; *significantly different from the respective tbuooh treatment without nadph, p=0.05, student's t-test).

after tbuooh treatment, nadph was added to permeabilized mitochondria
supplemented with gsh, to determine the importance of nadph for  xxxd2811xxx 
reduction (see methods). figure 4 illustrates the  xxxd2811xxx  reduction obtained with
the addition of 2.4 mm nadph after 1 or 0.5 #mol/ml tbuooh. the reduction
of  xxxd2811xxx  occurred both inside the mitochondria and in the media. it was clear
that the presence of nadph was important for reduction of  xxxd2811xxx .
discussion

nadph appears to be a critical factor in the tbuooh metabolism in tumor
mitochondria. kurosawa et al. [18] have shown that the rate of tbuooh
degradation is influenced by the nadph level in the rat liver mitochondria. in
these isolated mitochondria, succinate supplied the highest nadph level and
ketoglutarate was considerably less. the measurements made by murphy et al.
[17] however, indicated that the state 3 respiration was similar for ketoglutarate
and succinate in as-30d tumor mitochondria, suggesting that nadph producing capabilities may vary in rat liver and as-30d mitochondr]a.

131

it is not clear how nadph is supplied in vivo for the reduction of  xxxd2811xxx  in
the mitochondria. stubberfield and cohen [19] reported an interconversion between pyridine nucleotides after quinone-induced oxidative stress to isolated
hepatocytes. a striking coincidence in the fall of nad ÷ with a rise in total
nadph occurred with the total pyridine nucleotide levels remaining constant.
their hypothesized sequence of events involves an initial conversion of nad ÷
to nadp ÷ mediated by nad ÷ kinase, followed by reduction of nadp ÷ to
nadph. in fact, dimonte et al. [20] have shown that nad ÷ kinase activity is
increased by oxidative stress.
another possible pathway for the supply of nadph has been suggested by
iwahashi and nakamura [21]. this involves nadh kinase, which has been
localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane of saccharomyces cerevisiae and
the outer membrane of corn mitochondria [22]. through the use of a liposome
reconstitution study, atp produced in the mitochondria matrix was shown to be
accessible to the nadh kinase through the aid of the adp/atp antiporter. in
this case, nadph would be produced through the phosphorylation of the
nadh. therefore, with examples of two systems for the supply of nadph, it
will be necessary to study further the hepatoma mitochondria to determine what
happens to the pyridine nucleotides after oxidation and what regulates the
process.
 xxxg905xxx  and  xxxg1826xxx  have been identified as enzymes
active in the removal of gsh from proteins [23]. a difference in the activity or
presence of either of these enzyme systems could explain the difference in
recovery of reduced protein thiols with the hepatoma and rat liver mitochondria
after tbuooh.  xxxg905xxx  is probably not involved, for analysis of rat
heart cells has indicated that the enzyme is in the cell cytosol, but not the
mitochondria (personal communication from w.w. wells, department of
biochemistry, michigan state university, east lansing mi). thioredoxins
distinguished from their cellular counterparts have been purified from pig heart
and potato tuber mitochondria [24]. preliminary experiments assaying the activity of the nadph-dependent reductase (method 1, ref. 25) indicated that a rat
liver mitochondria extract had approximately five times more enzyme activity
per mg protein than the hepatoma mitochondria extract. we will continue to examine this enzyme system to determine if this difference in activity explains the
difference in protein dethiolation of mitochondria from liver and hepatoma cells.
in summary, it appears that when the isolated hepatoma mitochondria
metabolized tbuooh through the use of the gsh peroxidase system, not only
was the gsh oxidized, but prossg were also formed. hepatoma mitochondria
contain the complete system for reducing  xxxd2811xxx  to gsh.  xxxg981xxx 
was utilized, as  xxxd444xxx  inhibition of the reductase activity inhibited the  xxxd2811xxx 
reduction. and nadph may play a role as indicated by enhanced reduction of
 xxxd2811xxx  to gsh when excess nadph was supplied to the mitochondria.
