abstract: a series of novel, potent and selective  xxxd3047xxx [1,2-a]pyrazine dopamine d 4 receptor antagonists are
reported including cp-293,019 (d 4 k i = 3.4 nm, d 2 k i > 3,310 nm), which also inhibits apomorphine-induced
hyperlocomotion in rats after oral dosing. © 1998elsevier scienceltd. all rights reserved.
the discovery of the dopamine d 4 receptor subtype in 1991 and the higher affinity of the atypical
antipsychotic clozapine for d 4 relative to d 2 sparked a flurry of interest in developing a new class of
antipsychotic agents. 1-4 using structural elements common to known neuroleptics, a subset of 4,500
compounds was culled from a much larger compound library, and screening this subset for d 2 and d 4 receptor
binding uncovered several distinct yet related series with potency and selectivity for the

d4

receptor. the lead

compound in one family, 3a ((+)-cp-88,703), had been prepared several years earlier as a buspirone-haloperidol
hybrid, and was an attractive lead structure for the d 4 receptor antagonist program with d 4 k i = 4.1 nm and d 2
k i = 66 nm. although 3a had minimal d 4 selectivity, the conformationally rigid  xxxd3047xxx [1,2-a]pyrazine
template offered unique possibilities for manipulating the receptor binding profile through stereocontrol and
substituent

manipulation.

building

on previous experience

with the synthesis,

pharmacology, and

pharmacokinetics of 3a-related compounds led to 10j (cp-293,019) as a potential new therapy for the treatment
of schizophrenia.

target compounds c/s-3 and trans-lo are all prepared from racemic intermediate diamine (_)-1, which is
in turn derived from pyridine 2,5- xxxd2537xxx  in five steps. 5 n-arylation with 2-chloropyrimidine gives
racemic 2a, which is resolved with (-)-tartaric acid to (7s,9as)-2a in 99% ee (scheme 1). mitsunobu coupling
with phenols (ar1-oh) then gives target compounds 3. because the racemic trans isomer of 2 can not be
efficiently resolved, cis-n-boc derivative 4 is resolved instead followed by inversion of c7 oxidation to the
aldehyde, equilibration to the thermodyamically favored trans isomer, and reduction to optically active trans-nboc-5 in 27% overall yield. though somewhat inelegant in derivation, the versatile key intermediate (7r,9as)-5
commands a pivotal position in the synthetic development of this series.6 that is, deprotection of 5 and narylation allows for easy ar ! analoging, again using standard mitsunobu conditions, or conversely, initial oarylation of 5 followed by deprotection to 9 enables flexible analoging at n-ar 2. n-pyrimidyl and n-pyridyl
analogs are available by heating the appropriate aryl halide with base, n-phenyl analogs require a three-step
process of nucleophilic aromatic substitution with 2- or 4-fluoro-nitrobenzene, reduction to the aniline and diazo
de-amination with  xxxd171xxx . during the course of this work, direct nickel-catalyzed n-arylation methods
became available which condensed preparation of n-phenyl analogs into a single step. 7 thus, the two-pronged
synthetic sequence from 5 facilitates rapid construction of an a r l / a r 2 structure-activity matrix.
comparing binding affinities for the unsubstituted racemic cis and trans compounds 3a and 10a indicates
that both isomers maintain equally high affinity for d4, but trans-loa is significantly weaker at d 2 resulting in
greater selectivity (d2/d4 = 49, table 1). similarly, the resolved isomer trans-lob with 9as absolute

configuration has superior selectivity relative to cis-3b except that 10b has an unexpectedly high d 2 k i = 1,140
nm resulting in a dramatic improvement in selectivity (d2/d 4 = 326). in fact, trans-(7r,9as) configuration is the
key factor inducing d 4 potency and selectivity in this series.
probing phenyl ether sar with a range of para-pho substituents proved quite narrow in scope. for
example, 4-f analog 10e is equivalent to the parent 10b, but nearly all other analogs have higher d 4 k i or lower
selectivity or both (table 1). compounds 10d-g are a representative sample exhibiting no discernible trend based
on lipophilic, electronic, or h-bonding properties, suggesting a restrictive steric constraint at the 4-x-(c6h4)-o
position of the d 4 receptor pharmacophore allowing for only very small groups such as h and f. intermediate 7,
lacking the phenyl ether, is inactive at d 2 and d 4 receptors. as for the n-aryl substituent, the parent 2pyrimidyl 10b, 2-pyridyl 10h and phenyl 10i all have high d 4 affinity, but there is a consistent downward trend
in d 2 k i and a corresponding erosion in d2/d 4 selectivity for this trio. thus, this phase of sar investigation
shows that the original phenyl ether and 2-pyrimidyl appendages are nearly optimum, and identifies the
superior d2/d4 selectivity of the 7r,9as configuration.

metabolized in human liver microsomes (yl/2 = 3 min and 3.6 min,
respectively) whereas di-fluoro 10j has in vitro half-life of 12.2 min. furthermore, 10j displays very good in
vivo pharmacokinetics: mean plasma ti/2 = 4.5 h, mean cmax = 0.73 ktg/ml at about 1 h, and 93% mean
absolute bioavailability after oral dosing in rat (10 mg/kg in water, n = 4).
the n-(5-f-pyrimidyl) substituent not only improves metabolic stability, but it also decreases d 2
affinity while maintaining d 4 potency (compare d 2 ki for 10c and 10j). in fact, decreasing d 2 affinity and
improving d2/d 4 selectivity by n-aryl halogenation is a trend that applies to all three n-aryl groups: compare
d 2 ki's for pyrimidines 10b and 10j, pyridines 10h and 10k, and phenyls 10i to 101. in other words, the high
d 4 potency and selectivity arising from the trans-7r,9as configuration is enhanced by 2-pyrimidyl and para-f
as independent variables. the additive combination of these features in 10j (cp-293,019) produces high d 4
potency, lo00-fold d2/d4 selectivity (d 2 k i > 3,310 nm, d 4 k i = 3.4 nm), and functional antagonist activity

well as a variety ofadrenergic, histamine, and serotonin receptors (all ic50 > 1,000 nm), and has weak affinity
for 5htia (ic50 = 180 nm) and 5ht2a (ic50 = 500 nm).
in vivo, 10j inhibits the hyperactivity produced by apomorphine (apo) in habituated rats with ids0 =
10 mg/kg sc and 13.3 mg/kg po (vs. 1.78 mg/kg apo sc), but has no significant effect on spontaneous locomotor
activity when given alone to nonhabituated rats (ids0 > 56 mg/kg po, figure 2). d 2 antagonists such as
haloperidol also inhibit apo-induced hyperactivity, but display a markedly different profile than d 4

but another d 4 antagonist (l-745,870) had no effect on the symptoms of schizophrenia in one clinical trial.17,18
be that as it may, the results of pending clinical trials with other selective d 4 receptor antagonists should help
clarify the role of the d 4 receptor in the etiology of schizophrenia and related disorders.
