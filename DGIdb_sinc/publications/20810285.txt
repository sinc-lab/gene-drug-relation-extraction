microtubule cytoskeletons are involved in many essential functions throughout the life cycle of cells,
including transport of materials into cells, cell movement, and proper progression of cell division. small
compounds that can bind at the colchicine site of tubulin have drawn great attention because these
agents can suppress or inhibit microtubule dynamics and tubulin polymerization. to ﬁnd novel tubulin
polymerization inhibitors as anti-mitotic agents, we performed a virtual screening study of the colchicine
binding site on tubulin. novel tubulin inhibitors were identiﬁed and characterized by their inhibitory
activities on tubulin polymerization in vitro. the structural basis for the interaction of novel inhibitors
with tubulin was investigated by molecular modeling, and we have proposed binding models for these
hit compounds with tubulin. the proposed docking models were very similar to the binding pattern of
colchicine or  xxxd2980xxx  with tubulin. these new hit compound derivatives exerted growth inhibitory effects on the hl60 cell lines tested and exhibited strong cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase. furthermore, these compounds induced apoptosis after cell cycle arrest. in this study, we show that the validated
derivatives of compound 11 could serve as potent lead compounds for designing novel anti-cancer agents
that target microtubules.

1. introduction
microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers consisting of

a/b-tubulin heterodimers that are organized head-to-tail into linear protoﬁlaments1–3 and are involved in various cellular functions, including intracellular transport of material, movement of
cytoplasmic organelles or vesicles, and proper progression of cell
division.4,5 in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, microtubules are
highly dynamic, rapidly assembling, and disassembling according
to the cell’s needs.6 disruptions of the microtubule network can induce cell cycle arrest and ultimately lead to apoptosis. the mitotic
spindle, composed of microtubules generated by polymerization of
a/b-tubulin heterodimers, has been considered one of the most
important targets in treating many types of cancers.7,8
tubulin inhibitors have been known to bind distinct sites within b-tubulin, resulting in the destabilization or stabilization of
microtubules and leading to mitotic catastrophe. these agents

can be grouped into three classes according to the site of binding
on the tubulin molecule.9 the representative examples are the taxol, vinblastine, and colchicine binding sites. among these binding
sites, the taxol binding site has been most well characterized using
the crystal structure of tubulin5 and the partial overlaps with those
of other compounds such as epothilones10 or eleutherobin.10 vinblastine introduces a wedge at the interface of two tubulin molecules and thus interferes with tubulin assembly. recently, the
binding site of vinblastine was reported in the x-ray structure of
vinblastine bound to tubulin in a complex with the rb3 protein
 xxxg2220xxx -like domain (rb3-sld).11 the colchicine binding site
was also well characterized in the crystal structure of a/b-tubulin,
and was found at the interface of the a-subunit of the a/b heterodimer.11–13
several compounds that target the microtubule have been discovered and developed for cancer treatment.27 among these compounds,  xxxd2014xxx , paclitaxel, and  xxxd3513xxx  have already been
launched in clinical use. although vinblastine and taxol are effective anti-mitotic agents, they present many problems related to
their structural complexities, including difﬁculty in synthesis and

7093

formulations and poor bioavailability. the rapid emergence of
resistance against these drugs has also been reported.14–17 these
problems must be overcome in order to obtain novel anti-mitotic
agents with better therapeutic properties.
in this regard, we previously designed novel tubulin inhibitors
and evaluated the biological functions.18 we investigated the structural basis for the interaction of anti-mitotic agents with tubulin
and proposed the binding models for compound mdl-27048 in
the colchicine binding site on tubulin.19,20 the proposed model
was not only consistent with the results of a previous competition
experiment between colchicine and mdl-27048, but also suggested
an additional binding cavity on b-tubulin. based on these ﬁndings
from the proposed mdl-27048 and tubulin complex, the pharmacophore-based virtual screening was further employed to identify
new anti-mitotic agents from a chemical database.

recently, chiang et al. reported the identiﬁcation of tubulin
inhibitors targeting the colchicine binding site using ligand-based
pharmacophore and virtual screening.21 the hypo 1 pharmacophore model, which was built on the basis of 21 training-set indole
derivatives with varying levels of anti-proliferative activity, was
utilized to screen the chemical database in silico and four com-

pounds were identiﬁed. the most potent compound showed antiproliferative activity with an ic50 of 187 nm. alternatively, nguyen
et al.22 used the x-ray structure of the complex to design a pharmacophore model for a diverse set of colchicine site ligands, ranging from colchicine itself to curacin a. correlations between
pharmacophoric elements of the ligands were obtained in 3d by
aligning each ligand against colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx , followed by reﬁnement using the molecular volume and electrostatic
surface obtained from the x-ray structure data. the pharmacophoric points were derived from recurring tubulin-ligand interactions, and the overall pharmacophore for the colchicine-binding
site consisted of a total of seven points. each ligand possessed ﬁve
or six elements of the overall pharmacophore.
in this study, we used the crystal structure of tubulin-colchicine
complexes to perform pharmacophore-based virtual screening.
the information obtained from the above-mentioned studies was
considered before conducting this study. biological evaluations of

cell proliferation, in vitro inhibition of tubulin polymerization, and
cell cycle arrest at the g2/m phase revealed that compounds 5, 6,
and 11 showed potent anti-mitotic and anti-proliferative activity
and could serve as new lead compounds for the development of
anti-cancer therapeutics.

program built all the possible interactions that a ligand could
establish with a given binding site. the overall process of virtual
screening is presented in figure 1.

2. results and discussion

colchicine,  xxxd2980xxx  and  xxxd1744xxx  a4 commonly
contained the trimethoxyphenyl (tmp) group. in order to promote
a more successful pharmacophore screening, we constructed a focused chemical library of compounds containing the tmp group.
we searched for commercially available compounds harboring
the tmp moieties within the in-house database. a total number
of 15,925 commercially available chemical compounds were collected from the in-house chemical database. to ﬁnd new active colchicine-binding site inhibitors, we prepared 3d pharmacophore
queries for the structure-based virtual screening. as shown in
figure 2, the constructed pharmacophore consisted of three hydrogen bond acceptors (labeled as a1, a2, and a3), one hydrogen
bond donor (d1), and three hydrophobic centers (h1, h2, and
h3). we carried out virtual screening of the tmp focused library
for the colchicine binding pocket using pharmoscan™ (equispharm, korea). among the pharmacophore-based virtual screening
hit compounds, those exhibiting unfavorable interactions with
the binding site or adopting unrealistic conformations were

2.1. virtual screening
several x-ray crystal structures of complexes between b-tubulin and inhibitors of the colchicine binding site have been reported.11–13 a large number of synthetic and natural compounds
with diverse structures have been shown to bind at the colchicine
site. for the virtual screening of tentative inhibitors targeting the
colchicine binding site, we initially investigated the x-ray crystal
structure of the b-tubulin complex with colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx .12,23 using these data, we built a pharmacophore map of all
the interactions with amino acid residues that constitute the pocket on tubulin. for the generation of pharmacophore, we used the
pharmomapò program (equispharm, korea), a software package
that enabled us to build a feature-based pharmacophore in which
the pharmacophore points are represented by chemical features
such as hydrogen bond acceptors/donors or hydrophobicity. the

ﬁltered out by visual inspection. finally, we selected 34 compounds for further testing in vitro.

in table 3, we then tested the compound 11 derivatives for cell
anti-proliferative activity in the hl-60 cell line and the inhibition
of tubulin polymerization in vitro. we ﬁnally obtained three

2.3. biological evaluation of virtual screening hit compounds
in order to determine the activity of 34 virtually screened compounds, we evaluated the in vitro cell growth inhibition in the
hl60 (human  xxxg1785xxx ) cell line using the mtt
assay. the ic50 values represent the compound concentrations at
which there was a 50% decrease in cell growth after 3 days
of compound incubation. eleven compounds had ic50 values of
0.1–3.2 lm in the mtt assay and each value is listed in table 1.
compound e7010, which binds the colchicine site of tubulin, was
used as a positive control
we further tested whether the eleven compounds directly
interacted with tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization in vitro. as shown in table 2, among the eleven compounds, compounds 5, 6, and 11 inhibited tubulin polymerization with ic50
values of 20, 12.8, and 5 lm, respectively. these values were
comparable to the activity of e7010. however, the other eight compounds showed low activity in the in vitro tubulin polymerization
assay.

2.4. molecular docking analysis of tubulin polymerization
inhibitors
it should be noted that compounds 5, 6, and 11 showed not only
cell growth inhibition, but also inhibited tubulin polymerization in
vitro. these results demonstrate that the newly identiﬁed compounds 5, 6, and 11 can directly interact with the colchicine binding pocket on tubulin. to further elucidate the interactions
between compounds 5, 6, and 11 and tubulin, a molecular docking
study was performed. first, we investigated the binding modes of
compounds 5, 6, and 11 to the colchicine binding pocket on tubulin. the results of the molecular docking study are summarized in
figure 3. the docking study revealed that the 3,4,5-tmp group of
each compound was bound to the colchicine-binding site via
hydrophobic interaction with leu 248, ala 250, leu 255, and ala
316 of tubulin, respectively.
the indolizine moiety of compound 5 served as a p–p interaction site with the non-aromatic residue of the side chain of asn
258 in b-tubulin. in addition, the phenyl ring of compound 5 was
located at the a/b interface of tubulin (fig. 3a). in the case of compound 6, the nitrile group interacted with val 181, lys 352 side
chain and asn 258 side chain in b-tubulin. the carbonyl group in
compound 6 served as a hydrogen bond acceptor to the amino
group of the main chain of asp 251 (fig. 3b). the docking model
of compound 11 suggests the hydrogen bond interaction between
the compound and thr 179 in the backbone of a-tubulin and ala
250 in the main chain of b-tubulin (fig. 3c). by analyzing the results
of the docking studies, we found that the 3,4,5-tmp group of
compounds 5, 6, and 11 was structurally overlapped with the
3,4,5-tmp rings of both  xxxd2980xxx  and colchicine in the
tubulin complex (fig. 4).
2.5. biological activities test of virtual screen hit analogues and
their functional analysis
as shown in tables 1 and 2, compound 11 exhibited strong antiproliferative activity with inhibition of tubulin polymerization in
vitro. in order to validate the activity of the chemical scaffold of
the virtually screened hit compounds and to further identify compounds showing better activity, we searched for commercially
available derivatives of compounds 5, 6, and 11. while we could
not ﬁnd any derivatives of compounds 5 and 6, the derivatives of
compound 11 were obtained from commercial sources. as shown

compound 11 derivatives, compounds 12, 13, and 14, which
showed strong activity in hl-60 cell growth inhibition.
to validate and compare the cell cytotoxic activity of the identiﬁed compounds, hl60 cells were treated with various concentrations of each compound for 48 h. the cytotoxic effects induced by
treatment with the compounds (11–14) were analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry as described in section 4. each compound caused apoptotic cell death in a concentration-dependant manner (fig. 5). ec50
values for each compound were calculated using ﬂow cytometry
data. the ec50 values of compounds 12–14 revealed about 2–6-fold
more activity than e7010 (table 4). among these, compound 13
exhibited the most potent cytotoxic activity against hl-60 cells
(ec50 = 0.07 lm).
to determine whether the apoptotic cell death induced by
treatment with the compounds was caused by cell cycle arrest at
g2/m phase, in which the tubulin polymerization reaction is essential, we performed cell cycle analysis using ﬂow cytometry. hl60
cells were treated with a single concentration (0.1 lm or 0.5 lm,
depending on their ec50 values) of each compound for 24 h. flow
cytometric analysis at an early time point (24 h) showed that com-

pound 13 strongly arrested the cells at g2/m phase (fig. 6). however, the other compounds did not induce cell cycle arrest at g2/
m phase at least until 24 h incubation. at 48 h incubation, all compounds induced apoptosis as shown in figure 5. to analyze the
binding mode of compound 13 with tubulin, we performed a
molecular docking study of compound 13 and compared it with
those of colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx  ( fig. 7). comparison of
the x-ray structure-derived binding mode of colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx  with the docking model of compound 13 (fig. 7b and c)
showed that they share very similar binding shapes, conﬁrming the

using the pharmoscan™ (equispharm, korea) as described.18,25,26

and the binding site or adopting unrealistic conformations were ﬁltered out by visual inspection.

3. conclusions
4.3. cell culture
in this study, we present a successful application of pharmacophore-based virtual screening to identify novel compounds with
strong anti-mitotic activity based on their ability to inhibit tubulin
polymerization. the hit compounds selected by pharmacophorebased virtual screening were initially assayed in hl60 cell growth
inhibition and tubulin polymerization assays. among the hit compounds, compounds 5, 6, and 11 showed strong anti-proliferative
activity against hl60 cancer cell lines and also effectively inhibited
tubulin polymerization in vitro. we further validated the binding
model by virtually screening the hits and testing the cytotoxic
activity, cell cycle arrest, and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization in vitro. among these, the derivatives of compound 11 consistently exhibited potent activities and merit further evaluation as
novel anti-mitotic agents. furthermore, the proposed pharmacophore and docking model of compounds 5, 6, and 11 would provide
useful information for the development of new chemical entities of
microtubule-targeted anti-cancer agents.

cells (2  104 cells) were seeded into 96-well plates. after 24 h,
the cells were grown in the presence or absence of compounds for
another 48 h. after removing the 100 ll supernatant from each well,
20 ll of celltiter 96 aqueous solution (promega, usa) were added
into each well containing 100 ll of culture medium, and the cells
were further incubated for 2 h at 37 °c in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
of 5% co2. the reduction of absorbance at 490 nm was measured.
ic50 values for each compound were determined by calculating the
concentrations of 50% inhibition of cell proliferation.

4.5. tubulin polymerization assays

4.1. molecular docking study

hts-tubulin polymerization assay kit (cat. no. bk004/cds01,
cytoskeleton, usa) was used for in vitro tubulin polymerization assay as described by previous report.18 all components were added
to micro-wells kept at 0 °c, and baselines were established at
340 nm. assembly was followed sequentially at 0 and 37 °c, and
tubulin assembly was measured turbidometrically using molecular
device spectra max plus model (molecular devices, usa)
equipped with electronic temperature controllers.

to reﬁne the docking models of compounds 5, 6, and 11 into the
colchicine binding site of tubulin, automated docking simulation
was performed with autodock4.24 the x-ray crystal structure of
tubulin from protein data bank (pdb code 1sa0)12 was used for
our docking simulation. for the docking, the structure of tubulin
was kept rigid whereas all the torsional bonds in compounds 5,
6, and 11 were set free to perform ﬂexible docking. the binding energy between protein and inhibitors was evaluated using atom
afﬁnity potentials that were pre-calculated on grid maps using
autogrid. the grid maps had dimensions of 40  40  40 å with
0.375 å spacing between grid points. in autodock4, docking was
performed by combining a global genetic algorithm with local minimization, lamarckian genetic algorithm. one hundred trials were
performed for each docking, and the ﬁnal docked conformations
were clustered using a tolerance of 1 å root-mean-square deviation (rmsd). the docking conformation properly oriented toward
the colchicine binding pocket was selected, and the free energy
of binding was estimated. the molecular graphics of the possible
colchicine binding pocket and the reﬁned docking model with
compounds 5, 6, and 11 were generated using pymol package
(http://www.pymol.org).
4.2. virtual screening
to search for possible colchicine binding site inhibitors, the
pharmacophore was analyzed using pharmomap™, equispharm’s
in-house software package for structure-based virtual screening.18
constructed pharmacophore models were feature-based, that is,
the pharmacophoric points are presented by chemical features,
such as hydrogen bond acceptors/donors and hydrophobic features. the pharmacophore models were employed as search queries to identify colchicine binding site inhibitors from a 3d small
molecule database, which is a focused library of commercially

human  xxxg1785xxx  (hl-60) cell lines were maintained in rpmi 1640 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin
(1%) and heat-inactivated fbs (10%). cells were grown at 37 °c in
a 5% co2 humidiﬁed incubator.
4.4. cell proliferation assay

4.6. apoptosis and cell cycle analysis
the effects of compounds on cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed using ﬂow cytometry as described by kim do et al.26 brieﬂy,
human  xxxg1785xxx  hl60 cells (3  105) were seeded
in 6-well plates. after 24 h incubation, the cells were further grown
in the presence of carrier (dmso) alone or test compounds for 24 h
and 48 h. cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with pbs
and ﬁxed in chilled 70% ethanol at 20 °c. the cells were then centrifuged to remove the ﬁxative, washed and suspended in pbs containing 100 lg/ml of  xxxg1963xxx  and 50 lg/ml of  xxxd3027xxx  iodide,
and kept in the dark for 30 min to stain dna. the cell cycle was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (becton dickinson facscalibur). a total of 10,000 cells were counted for each determination. apoptotic
cells were determined by measuring the fractions of fragmented
dna. all ﬂow cytometry analyses were performed in at least three
independent experiments.
