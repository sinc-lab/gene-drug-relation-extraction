have distinguished low voltage-activated (lva)1 and high voltage-activated (hva) ca2⫹ currents. lva calcium currents,
mainly referred to as “t-type currents” due to their fast inactivation and small conductance, have been described in a wide
variety of cell types (1). although their physiological functions
still remain obscure, they are thought to play a role in neuronal
burst firing (2), pacemaker activity in heart (3, 4), aldosterone
secretion (5), or fertilization (6). t-type currents are mainly
detected at early stages of development as well as at a given
transition (g1/s) of the cell cycle (7–9). in addition, it has been
reported that enhanced expression of t-type current is associated with a variety of diseases that include cardiac hypertrophy (10), hypertension (11), and epilepsy (12). unfortunately,
the lack of specific t-type channel blockers has considerably
impaired their functional characterization. the identification
of the molecular structure of t-type channels has therefore
become an important challenge in order to unravel their implication in cellular functions (13).
the low level of knowledge about the molecular nature of
t-type channels contrasts with the extensive molecular and
functional characterization of hva channels (l-, n-, p/q-, and
r-types) related to the discovery of specific drugs and toxins.
hva calcium channels exhibit an oligomeric structure composed of a pore-forming ␣1 subunit containing voltage sensors
and drug/toxin binding sites, associated with regulatory subunits (␤, ␣2/␦, and ␥). the functional diversity of hva calcium
channels is primarily related to the existence of several ␣1
subunits (␣1a–f and ␣1s) encoded by distinct genes, many of
which generate splice variants with specific properties, as described for the ␣1a isoforms that generate p/q-type channels
(14).
a search in the genetic data bases for sequences homologous,
but not identical, to known ca2⫹ channel ␣1 subunits was an
alternative to conventional molecular cloning strategies for the
identification of novel ␣1 subunits, and a major advance in
t-type ca2⫹ channel studies has resulted from the identification of several ests and genomic sequences corresponding to a
subset of distantly related ␣1 subunits (15). the full-length
cdnas encoding three distinct ␣1 subunits (␣1g, ␣1h, and ␣1i)
have recently been identified, which give rise, in expression
systems, to ca2⫹ channel currents exhibiting hallmarks of
native t-type currents (15–17). the genes that encode mammalian ␣1g, ␣1h, and ␣1i proteins are related to the caenorhabditis elegans gene c54d2.5 described as a putative ca2⫹
channel. these recent data (15–18) provide clear evidence that

we describe here several novel properties of the human ␣1g subunit that forms t-type calcium channels.
the partial intron/exon structure of the corresponding
gene  xxxg307xxx  was defined and several ␣1g isoforms
were identified, especially two isoforms that exhibit a
distinct iii-iv loop: ␣1g-a and ␣1g-b. northern blot and
dot blot analyses indicated that ␣1g mrna is predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in thalamus,
cerebellum, and substantia nigra. additional experiments have also provided evidence that ␣1g mrna is
expressed at a higher level during fetal life in nonneuronal tissues (i.e. kidney, heart, and lung). functional
expression in hek 293 cells of a full-length cdna encoding the shortest ␣1g isoform identified to date, ␣1g-b,
resulted in transient, low threshold activated ca2ⴙ currents with the expected permeability ratio (isr > ica >
iba) and channel conductance (⬃7 ps). these properties,
together with slowly deactivating tail currents, are typical of those of native t-type ca2ⴙ channels. this ␣1grelated current was inhibited by  xxxd2638xxx  (ic50 ⴝ 2 ␮m)
and weakly blocked by ni2ⴙ ions (ic50 ⴝ 148 ␮m) and
amiloride (ic50 > 1 mm). we showed that steady state
activation and inactivation properties of this current
can generate a “window current” in the range of ⴚ65 to
ⴚ55 mv. using neuronal action potential waveforms, we
show that ␣1g channels produce a massive and sustained ca2ⴙ influx due to their slow deactivation properties. these latter properties would account for the
specificity of ca2ⴙ influx via t-type channels that occurs
in the range of physiological resting membrane potentials, differing considerably from the behavior of other
ca2ⴙ channels.

cloning of the human t-type ca2⫹ channel ␣1g subunit
genes encoding t-type channels are members of a third subfamily in addition to the gene family encoding neuronal calcium channels (␣1a, ␣1b, and ␣1e) and the gene family encoding
l-type calcium channels (␣1c, ␣1d, ␣1f, and ␣1s). an important
issue now is to elucidate the molecular basis for the functional
diversity of t-type ca2⫹ channels (2).
to address this issue, we have cloned and expressed a human ␣1g subunit. the molecular data presented here describe
several new findings concerning the ␣1g subunit, such as the
existence of several splice variants, the partial gene structure,
and the mrna expression pattern in adult and fetal human
tissues. functional expression was achieved in order to determine the electrophysiological and pharmacological profiles of
the human ␣1g-related currents, and we show that the ␣1g
subunit generates a sustained ca2⫹ current with specific features. characterization of the human ␣1g subunit is an important step that significantly extends our knowledge of the molecular and functional properties of the t-type ca2⫹ channels.

⬃3.8 kb, as a function of the ␣1g isoform detected. this analysis was
achieved using four different sources of human mrna: adult whole
brain, adult cerebellum, adult thalamus, and fetal kidney (clontech). first strand cdna synthesis (reverse transcription) was performed using superscript 2 (life technologies) with a sequence-specific
primer (5⬘-gctttctcccaacagcttc-3⬘) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the enzyme was then heat-inactivated (15 min, 70 °c).
after cooling on ice, the samples were treated with ribonuclease h (life
technologies, 4 units) for 20 min at 37 °c. pcr amplification was
performed with 2 ␮l of the reverse transcription mixture in a final
volume of 50 ␮l using the expand long template pcr system (roche
molecular biochemicals) with 10⫻ buffer 1 (10⫻ buffer 1: 500 mm
tris-hcl, ph 9.2, 160 mm (nh4)2so4, 17.5 mm mgcl2) supplemented
with me2so to a final concentration of 5%, 200 nm dntp, 50 pmol of
forward primer (5⬘-cttcggcaactacgtgctcttc-3⬘), 50 pmol of
reverse primer (5⬘-tcctgaaatccagctcagctcc-3⬘), and 2.6 units
of dna polymerase mix. a hot start pcr procedure was performed with
the following parameters for initial denaturation: 94 °c for 2 min,
followed by 30 cycles (10 cycles with denaturation at 94 °c for 10 s,
annealing at 65 °c for 30 s, extension at 68 °c for 6 min; and 20 cycles
with denaturation at 94 °c for 10 s, annealing at 65 °c for 30 s, extension at 68 °c for 6 min plus a 20-s increment/cycle) and a final extension
(at 68 °c for 7 min). the cdna fragments were subcloned in puc18
using the sureclone ligation kit (amersham pharmacia biotech). sixtyeight positive clones were randomly chosen and fully sequenced using
automatic sequencing (applied biosystems) with the dye terminator
technology. a similar rt-pcr strategy was used for the identification of
cdna fragments covering from nt ⫺120 to 3936 with the forward and
reverse primers 5⬘-tagagcccaccagatgtgcc-3⬘ and 5⬘-gagatgagcaccaacagccc-3⬘, respectively. no evidence for sequence variation has been identified to date in this region.
northern and dot blot analyses—commercial human northern blot
membranes (clontech) were hybridized using a 930-bp fragment (nt
3660 – 4590) generated by pcr amplification and random-primed with
[␣-32p]dctp. the membranes were treated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. relative amounts of mrna in each line were evaluated
using two probes: a ubiquitin probe and a ␤-actin probe as internal
controls. two independent dot blot membranes, normalized in their
mrna abundance by the manufacturer according to the expression
profile of eight housekeeping genes (master-blot mrna membrane;
clontech) were treated in similar conditions using a probe covering
the c-terminal region (nt 6440 – 6970). the exposure time for northern
and dot blot membranes was 6 days. densitometric analysis of the
autoradiograms was performed using an alphaimager system (alpha
innotech corp.) in order to provide semiquantitation of ␣1g mrna in
each condition. no signal was observed for internal dna controls,
except for human genomic dna.
transient transfection—a plasmid encoding the reporter gene cd8
(25) was used in transient transfection experiments, together with the
pbk-cmv construct that encodes for the ␣1g-b subunit, in a 1:10 ratio.
human embryonic kidney cells hek-293 were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (eurobio) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v). for optimal transfection,
cells were plated at 30 – 40% confluence on petri dishes coated with
poly- xxxd2793xxx  (sigma). a standard calcium phosphate transfection
procedure was performed. positively transfected cells were identified
with anti-cd8 antibody-coated beads (dynal) and further analyzed by
voltage clamp experiments. cdnas encoding the rat brain ␣1a-a, ␣2/␦1b,
and ␤1b subunits were inserted in the vertebrate expression vector
pmt2 (14) and cotransfected in hek 293 cells as a mix of ␣1a-a, ␣2/␦1b,
␤1b, and cd8 cdnas at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:0.1.
electrophysiology—macroscopic currents were recorded by the
whole-cell patch clamp technique at room temperature (⬃21 °c) using
an axopatch 200b amplifier. data were acquired on a pc computer
using the pclamp6 software suite (axon instruments). records were
filtered at 5 khz. leak and capacitive currents were subtracted using a
p/⫺5 procedure when needed (i.e. for tail current recordings). extracellular solution contained 2 mm cacl2 (or 2 mm bacl2 or 2 mm srcl2), 160
mm teacl, 10 mm hepes (ph to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). pipettes made of borosilicate glass with a typical resistance of
1–2 megaohms were filled with an internal solution containing 110 mm
cscl, 3 mm mgcl2, 10 mm egta, 10 mm hepes, 3 mm mg-atp, 0.6 mm
gtp (ph to 7.2 with csoh). for pharmacological experiments, drugs
were prepared daily in the external medium, freshly (amiloride and
 xxxd2638xxx ) or from a stock solution (nicl2). the various dilutions were
applied to cells by a gravity-driven homemade perfusion device, controlled by solenoid valves. single channel recordings were done in the
cell-attached mode. sylgard coated pipettes (resistance of 7–15 mega-

in silico strategies and probe design—genetic data bases were
searched for cdna and genomic sequences homologous, but not identical, to known ␣1 subunit cdnas using (i) sequence similarity search
(blast; ref. 19) and (ii) a search for conserved motifs, such as a
voltage sensor s4 ⫽ ((r/k)xx)4 (biomotif).2 among the various human
sequences that were identified, we focused on sequences homologous to
the c. elegans gene c54d2.5 (genbanktm accession no. u37548). two
est clones, h06096 and h19230, available from the image consortium (20), were sequenced and compared with a large set of calcium
channel ␣1 and sodium channel ␣ cdnas, using the clustalw1.7 multialignment software (21). these cdna sequences were thus defined as
candidates for putative new calcium channel ␣1 subunits in humans
and subsequently used as probes for both northern blot analysis and
screening of cdna libraries. the genomic region of chromosome 17q22
that contains the  xxxg307xxx  gene was recently sequenced (ac004590).
the identification of the intron/exon structure was performed using the
grail software (22) for the search of putative exons. alignment of the
cdna sequences characterized in this study, together with the genomic
sequence, led us to identify the exons of the  xxxg307xxx  gene that form
␣1g transcripts.
isolation and characterization of human cdnas—a ␭gt10 human
cerebellum cdna library (clontech) was screened by conventional
filter hybridization according to the manufacturer’s protocols, using a
probe generated by pcr using h06096 cdna as template. this probe
covers nucleotides 3660 – 4590 of the final cdna. hybridization was
performed at 42 °c for 16 –20 h in a solution containing 50% formamide
using a random primed [␣-32p]dctp-labeled probe that was added at a
concentration of 5 ⫻ 106 cpm/ml. the membranes were then washed
with a final stringency of 0.1⫻ ssc, 0.1% sds at 65 °c. three ␭gt10
clones named cc1/cc2/cc3 were identified. an additional est
(h19230) corresponding to the 3⬘ region of the messenger was also
identified. the completion of the 5⬘ region of the sequence was achieved
using long reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
protocols (23) on mrna from human total brain (clontech) using
primers defined from the rat sequence (ref. 15; af027984) and racepcr (24). cc1 and cc3 are overlapping clones that correspond to a
splice variation of the human ␣1g. the resulting isoforms were designated ␣1g-a (af126966) and ␣1g-b (af126965). the cdna structure and
sequence encoding these subunits was further identified following the
characterization of two overlapping cdna fragments of 4056 bp (nt
⫺120 to 3936) and 3432 bp (nt 2840 – 6272), according to af126965 (see
fig. 1a). nucleotide sequences were determined using automatic sequencing (applied biosystems) with the dye terminator strategy. a
full-length cdna encoding the human ␣1g isoform designated ␣1g-b was
constructed using the unique restriction sites mentioned in fig. 1a and
subsequently subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pbk-cmv
(stratagene).
long range rt-pcr for native isoform identification—a search for
native isoforms of the ␣1g subunit was further performed using long
range rt-pcr (23) and sequence examination of the cdna fragment
covering from nt 2840 (domain ii) to nt 6272 (c-terminal region),
according to af126966. the size of this fragment varied from ⬃3.4 to

toward 0 mv by bathing the cells in a high potassium solution containing 140 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm egta, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm

results

cloning of a human ␣1g subunit—several cdna clones
covering from domain ii to the c-terminal region of the human
␣1g isoform were isolated from a cerebellum cdna library
using a probe designed from the identified est h06096 (fig.
1a). additional cdna clones that cover the entire coding region
of the human ␣1g were identified using rt-pcr and racepcr from human total brain mrna. finally, two overlapping
cdna fragments of 4 and 3.4 kb covering from nt ⫺120 to 6272
were obtained by rt-pcr from human total brain mrna to
further confirm the cdna structure of human ␣1g isoforms. a
full-length cdna encoding the ␣1g-b isoform was then constructed using the overlapping cdnas (fig. 1a).
alignment of our cdna sequences to the corresponding
genomic region of chromosome 17q22 (ac004590), together
with the use of grail software (22) for the identification of
putative exons in the genomic sequence, led us to identify the
partial intron/exon structure of the  xxxg307xxx  gene that encodes the ␣1g isoforms (fig. 1b). the  xxxg307xxx  gene covers

⬍70 kb in the 17q22 region. a total of 41 putative exons was
predicted using grail software (fig. 1b). the 5⬘-end of
 xxxg307xxx  (⬃500 bp), which has been determined recently
(27), is comprised within a single exon. accordingly, this exon
that also contains the first atg codon was designated exon 1.
this atg is comprised within a consensus site for initiation of
translation: axxatgg (28). the coding region of the two human ␣1g subunits described later in this study is composed of
34 exons. one of these two variants which has the highest
homology with the original rat sequence (15), was named ␣1g-a.
the isoform ␣1g-b resulted from the use of an alternate 5⬘-splice
donor site of exon 25 combined with the acceptor site on exon 27
(fig. 2, a and b). four additional exons were identified in
rt-pcr experiments conducted on mrnas from human total
brain, cerebellum, thalamus, and fetal kidney. these exons
encode insertions within the ii-iii loop (insertion e), within the
iii-iv loop (insertion c), and within the cooh-terminal region
(insertions f and d) (fig. 2a). in our experiments, the insertion
c, which corresponded to the use of exon 26 (fig. 2b), was found
only in combination with variation b. three other predicted
exons that are included in fig. 1b have not been retrieved
experimentally to date. sequencing of cdna fragments obtained using long range rt-pcr experiments was performed in
order to determine the potential association of the a/b, c, d, e,
and f regions in ␣1g transcripts as well as their relative abundance in native human tissues. a total of 68 cdna fragments
obtained from human total brain, cerebellum, thalamus, and
fetal kidney mrnas was analyzed (fig. 2c). a majority of ␣1g-a
isoform alone, or in combination with insertion e, was found in
neuronal tissues. by contrast, only the ␣1g-b isoform, mostly
associated with insertion c, was detected in fetal kidney.

partial cdna fragments were isolated from ␭gt10 human libraries (cc1, cc2, and cc3). two ests and two pcr fragments covered the 5⬘- and
3⬘-ends. two additional pcr fragments of 4 and 3.4 kb, according to ␣1g-b sequence (af126965), were subcloned and sequenced. this latter pcr
fragment was used further for ␣1g isoform determination as described under “materials and methods” and in the legend to fig. 2. a full-length
cdna was constructed using overlapping pcr strategies as well as the unique restriction sites. an additional restriction site (bsshii) was
introduced by pcr in the cdna covering the untranslated 5⬘ region to allow final assembly and subcloning in the pbk-cmv vector. b, the partial
intron/exon structure of the human gene  xxxg307xxx  was determined from sequence ac004590 using the grail software for exon prediction.

cloning of the human t-type ca2⫹ channel ␣1g subunit

the construct ␣1g-a encodes a 2250-amino acid (aa) protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 249.333 da. primary sequences of the two variants ␣1g-a and ␣1g-b were compared with
the rat and mouse ␣1g proteins (fig. 3). the four transmembrane domains are highly conserved (98 –100% identity). the
connecting loops between domains i and ii and between domains ii and iii, as well as the nh2 and cooh-terminal
regions are more divergent (85–95% identity). within the ii-iii
loop, overall identity is 90% without taking into account insertion e (23 aa), which occurs in human, rat, and mouse (fig. 3a).
the two variants ␣1g-a and ␣1g-b encode a distinct intracellular
iii-iv loop (fig. 3b). by contrast with the mouse ␣1g sequence,
insertion c (18 aa) was found associated only with the splice
variant b in our experiments (fig. 2c). nevertheless, this intracellular loop is shorter (50 –70 aa) compared with others
(⬃300 aa). the iii-iv loop in isoform ␣1g-a is 100% identical to
the rat ␣1g sequence. the other isoform, ␣1g-b, exhibits a
shorter iii-iv linker resulting from a 21-bp deletion described
above. sequence comparison of the iii-iv loop of several ␣1g,
␣1h, and ␣1i subunits, as well as the putative c54d2 gene
product, revealed that sequence variability within this intracellular loop is highly related to the length of this region. the

sequences surrounding this insertion are more homologous,
and several aa are conserved (fig. 3b). the aa sequences corresponding to insertions f (48 aa) and d (45 aa) in the cterminal region of the human ␣1g subunit that are presented in
fig. 3c have not been described to date. the search for putative
regulatory sites, such as consensus phosphorylation sites for
 xxxg1836xxx  and protein kinase c, led us to identify eight
 xxxg1836xxx  and up to 20 protein kinase c sites contained
within the intracellular regions. most of these consensus sites
are conserved among human and rat sequences. interestingly,
a  xxxg1836xxx /protein kinase c consensus site identified in
loop iii-iv for ␣1g-a is removed in the isoform ␣1g-b, as a
consequence of splicing of exon 25 (fig. 3b).
distribution of ␣1g mrna in human tissues—northern blot
analysis of a large variety of adult human tissues showed that
␣1g mrna is predominantly present in the brain (fig. 4a).
nonneuronal tissues that were positive were ovary and placenta. a very weak band was also observed in testis, small
intestine, colon, and heart. positive tissues exhibited a major
band of approximately 8.5 kb along with discrete larger bands.
the reason for a smaller band in the prostate mrna lane is
currently unknown. considering neuronal tissues, cerebellum
as well as thalamus and substantia nigra displayed a strong
signal (fig. 4b). several other tissues from the central nervous
system also revealed a significant level of ␣1g expression, while
other areas, like hippocampus, showed a weaker ␣1g mrna
signal. the pattern of ␣1g mrna expression identified in
northern blots was mostly confirmed using dot blot analysis
with densitometric quantification (fig. 5). two independent dot
blot membranes were examined (see “materials and methods”).
brain tissues showed the strongest signal (thalamus ⬎ occipital lobe ⬎ cerebellum). the only difference between dot blot and
northern blot analyses concerns the spinal cord, since expression of ␣1g mrna was undetectable on northern blot, although
the use of two independent internal controls, ubiquitin and
␤-actin, suggested that the quality this mrna sample was
correct on the northern blot membrane. altogether, dot blot
experiments revealed a level of ␣1g expression in good agreement with northern blot analysis for other neuronal tissues.
it is worth underlining the fact that analysis of two independent dot blot membranes revealed that the ␣1g mrna
expression level was significantly higher in fetal peripheral
tissues, heart, kidney, lung, spleen, and thymus, compared
with adult tissues (fig. 5b). this pattern of expression was not
displayed in the brain, since the amount of ␣1g mrna was
equivalent in adult and fetal brain. since dot blot membranes
are normalized for the amount of mrna present in each dot
(see “materials and methods”), we have performed a densitometric analysis that shows the relative abundance of ␣1g
mrna in these tissues (fig. 5b). altogether, these data indicate that the expression of ␣1g is developmentally regulated.
electrophysiological description of the human ␣1g currents—functional properties of human ␣1g-dependent channels were investigated using the ␣1g-b isoform, as expressed in
hek-293 cells. this ␣1g-b isoform corresponds to the minimal
structure identified to date for the native human ␣1g subunit.
robust t-type ca2⫹ currents were recorded in the presence of
2 mm ca2⫹ (fig. 6a). activation kinetics was voltage-dependent, with time constants ranging from 10 to 1.2 ms for potentials between ⫺50 and ⫹30 mv. inactivation kinetics was also
strongly voltage-dependent. current decay was best described
by a single exponential function, with time constants ranging
from 35 to 12 ms between ⫺50 and ⫹30 mv. this property
implied criss-crossing of current traces as observed for native
t-type currents (29).
this current activated around ⫺60 mv and peaked at ⫺30

bp) removes most of the iiis6 region of the protein.

mv, while reversal potential was observed at ⫹50 mv (fig. 6b).
when calcium (ca2⫹) was replaced with equimolar barium
(ba2⫹) or strontium (sr2⫹) ions, ␣1g currents reflected permeation properties typical of that of t-type calcium channels (fig.
6c). the amplitude of ba2⫹ currents was smaller (permeability
ratio of ba2⫹/ca2⫹ ⬃0.96), while sr2⫹ currents were larger
(permeability ratio of sr2⫹/ca2⫹ ⬃1.35) than ca2⫹ currents
(n ⫽ 6; fig. 6d). interestingly, ba2⫹ current inactivation kinetics was faster, compared with ca2⫹ current. single channel
currents were measured in the presence of 110 mm ba2⫹ (fig.
6e), using tail current protocols (16). unitary current amplitude was recorded for membrane potentials ranging from ⫺120
to 0 mv, indicating a slope conductance of 7.3 ps (n ⫽ 3; fig.

pharmacological properties of human ␣1g subunit—we
have studied the sensitivity of human ␣1g channels to three
molecules, nickel (ni2⫹), amiloride, and  xxxd2638xxx , that are
considered to be t-type channel blockers. the divalent ion ni2⫹
was described as a potent blocker of t-type currents; however,
block of the ca2⫹ currents generated by the human ␣1g subunit
was modest, with an ic50 of 148 ⫾ 10 ␮m (n ⫽ 8; fig. 7a). this
␣1g current was also poorly sensitive to amiloride, since less
than 30% of inhibition in the current amplitude (n ⫽ 5) was
obtained in the presence of 1 mm amiloride (not shown). fi-

cloning of the human t-type ca2⫹ channel ␣1g subunit

gating properties of human ␣1g channels—the voltage dependence of the channel activation was determined by measuring tail current amplitudes at various depolarizing pulses
(fig. 8, a and c) that fully activates ␣1g currents. for that
purpose, duration of each pulse was adjusted to the average
time-to-peak current values presented in the upper part of fig.
8a. normalized amplitudes of tail currents plotted as a function of the membrane potential described a biphasic smooth
curve for steady state activation, which could be best fitted by
the sum of two boltzmann functions (fig. 8c) with half activation values of v1 ⫽ ⫺41.8 mv and v2 ⫽ ⫺14.7 v (n ⫽ 5). steady
state inactivation properties were determined using a standard
double pulse protocol (fig. 8b). a 5-s prepulse (⫺100 to ⫺35
mv) preceded a test pulse at ⫺30 mv. data were fitted by a
single boltzmann function with v0.5 ⫽ ⫺71.6 mv (fig. 8c).
superimposition of the steady state activation and inactivation
curves revealed the existence of a window current in the range

of ⫺65 to ⫺55 mv (fig. 8c).
deactivation properties of ␣1g-related channels—the deactivation properties of human ␣1g channels were deduced from
tail current analysis (fig. 9). fig. 9a shows that kinetics of tail
currents was slower when repolarizing membrane potentials
were more positive, reflecting a strong voltage dependence of
the deactivation process for ␣1g-related currents (fig. 9b).
additional experiments using action potential waveforms
(apws) as a voltage clamp command were designed to evaluate
whether ␣1g-related channels allow brief or sustained entry of
ca2⫹ in the range of physiological membrane resting potentials
(about ⫺75 mv). when hek cells overexpressing the human
␣1g subunit were stimulated with neuronal apws (2-ms duration) applied from a holding potential of ⫺75 mv, a slow inward
ca2⫹ current following the apw was recorded (fig. 9c). this
current was totally suppressed by the application of 1 ␮m
 xxxd2638xxx  (not shown). by contrast, application of this apw
protocol to cells that expressed hva current generated by ␣1a
subunit resulted in a transient inward calcium current that
correlates with the duration of the apw (fig. 9c). a similar
result was obtained using native neurons expressing only hva
currents (not shown).

the slow deactivation kinetics of the currents generated by the ␣1g

repolarization. in contrast, hva current generated by the ␣1a- xxxg220xxx

spliced isoforms of the ␣1g subunit, revealing therefore that the
molecular diversity of t-type channels not only relies on the
expression of three subunits encoded by distinct genes, ␣1g,
␣1h, and ␣1i (17). in humans, the gene  xxxg307xxx  encoding ␣1g
is localized on chromosome 17q22 (15). exon prediction using
grail (22) led us to identify 41 putative exons within the
genomic sequence that covers the coding region of that gene
(ac004590). we have numbered 38 of them that were unambiguously identified in cdna cloning and rt-pcr experiments. whether additional exons exist cannot be excluded.
recently, toyota et al. (27) have performed 5⬘-race analysis of
 xxxg307xxx  in order to identify the transcription start site of
this gene in humans (genbanktm accession no. af124351). in
good agreement with our results, no additional exon was found
upstream to the one identified here as exon 1. more importantly, these authors have demonstrated that the  xxxg307xxx 
gene is found inactivated by aberrant methylation in several
human tumors.
we have identified here that the ␣1g-b isoform corresponds to

cloning of the human t-type ca2⫹ channel ␣1g subunit
ous ␣1g isoforms exhibit important sequence variations in the
iii-iv loop, inactivation properties of currents related to the
human ␣1g-b subunit did not show significant differences from
those of currents related to rodents ␣1g isoforms (15, 31). further work is needed to clearly examine whether this region of
␣1g influences the voltage-dependent inactivation process and,
subsequently, if sequence variations within the iii-iv loop
have functional consequences on t-type ca2⫹ channel activity.
northern blot and dot blot analyses have clearly indicated
that the highest level of ␣1g expression occurs in human brain
tissues, particularly in thalamus, cerebellum, substantia nigra,
and frontal and occipital lobes. overall, these data correlate
well with those of the recent study by talley et al. (41). expression of ␣1g in thalamus is expected to underlie the low threshold spike activity described in thalamic neurons (42). furthermore, overexpression of t-channels in this structure has been
observed in gaers rats, an animal model of absence epilepsy
(12). more importantly, our data have revealed that the ␣1g
subunit expression is developmentally regulated. while ␣1g is
rather similarly expressed in adult and fetal brain, it is much
more predominant in fetal peripheral tissues such as heart,
kidney, or lung. enhanced expression of an ␣1 subunit encoding
t-type channels in fetal heart correlates well with electrophysiological data, since it is generally accepted that t-type currents
are preferentially recorded in embryonic or newborn myocytes
(43). it complicates, however, the identification of the so-called
cardiac t-type channel, since another member of the t-type
channel family, ␣1h, has been cloned from heart tissue (16).
the relative expression of both ␣1h- and ␣1g-related channels
in cardiovascular tissues is therefore an important issue that
needs to be further investigated.
the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of
human ␣1g currents were examined in a physiological external
calcium concentration (2 mm), except for the determination of
the single channel conductance (⬃7 picosiemens). overall, biophysical properties such as low activation threshold (⬍⫺60
mv), potential for peak current (⫺30 mv), activation and inactivation kinetics, cross-over of current traces, and permeation
properties (isr ⬎ ica ⱖ iba) are typical of that of t-type currents
recorded in native cells. our data are also in good agreement
with those of other cloned ␣1g channels, although comparison
is impaired by the differences in experimental conditions. for
instance, threshold of activation at more positive potentials
(⫺50 mv) and a shift of the i/v curve (peak at ⫺10 mv)
reported for the mouse isoform (30) is likely to be due to the use
of high concentrations (20 mm) of divalent cations. it is worth
noting that steady state activation is best described by the sum
of two boltzmann distributions. similar results were obtained
for human ␣1h channels (18) and rat ␣1g channels (44). a
kinetic model that includes several closed state transitions
prior to opening was proposed in ref. 44, and this scheme can
accurately account for most of the qualitative and quantitative
features of human ␣1g channels described here. by contrast, a
single boltzmann function fits the steady state inactivation.
this dual behavior for activation and inactivation is reminiscent of that reported for several other channel types, including
n-type in dorsal root ganglion neurons (45), for which a bimodal activation process (i.e. “willing”/“reluctant” modes) was coupled to only one inactivation process.
the pharmacological profile of human ␣1g-related channels
was determined using the few molecules, nickel (ni2⫹),  xxxd2638xxx , and amiloride, which have been used to discriminate
lva t-type calcium channels from hva calcium channels. the
human ␣1g channel has a relatively high sensitivity to  xxxd2638xxx  with an ic50 in the micromolar range. this value is quite
comparable with the  xxxd2638xxx  inhibition of human ␣1h cur-

the minimal structure of the native ␣1g subunit in humans,
and therefore it is important to consider that analysis of this
isoform provides a basis for the comparison of the deduced aa
sequences of ␣1g subunits among species, as well as the identification of regions that are critical to explore for further
structure-function studies. indeed, a mouse ␣1g subunit recently described (31) exhibits two insertions within loops ii-iii
and iii-iv, compared with rat ␣1g (15). we demonstrate here
that the insertion in loop ii-iii corresponds to the use of an
additional exon (exon 14 as referred to in the human sequence).
we have identified the expression of exon 14, i.e. insertion e,
occurs in human brain mostly in association with region a. in
addition, we have identified two novel insertions d and f in the
c-terminal region of the human ␣1g subunit. the occurrence of
these latter insertions is low: 1 and 7 out of 68 for d and f,
respectively. the functional role of these insertions in ii-iii
loop and the c terminus remain to be determined. unexpectedly, while sequencing our batch of 3.4/3.8-kb fragments that
covered from domain ii to the c-terminal region, we have found
a truncated form of ␣1g cdna (3 out of 68) that corresponds to
a 102-bp deletion (nt 4498 – 4601; af126965) of a region that
encodes the iiis6 segment. the reason for the existence of such
a truncated form of ␣1g, which corresponds to an aberrant
alternative splicing of exon 25, is unclear at the present time.
the differences among human, mouse, and rat ␣1g subunits
within the iii-iv loop are likely to correspond to the combination of two mechanisms. first, we have demonstrated here that
the use of an alternate splice site within exon 25 can generate
the two human ␣1g isoforms, ␣1g-a and ␣1g-b. we referred here
to these isoforms as ␣1g-a and ␣1g-b, by comparison to the
original rat ␣1g subunit (af027984), which is identical to the
human ␣1g-a. a similar mechanism is likely to occur in rodents,
since a sequence similar to the iii-iv loop of ␣1g-b can be
retrieved in rat (32). second, human, mouse, and rat exhibit an
additional insertion, designated c, in this region (31, 32). in our
study, insertion c was found only in combination with b, resulting in ␣1g-bc isoforms that were mostly expressed in fetal kidney. again, the role of insertion c in the human ␣1g subunit has
yet to be determined. altogether, we describe here two mechanisms that are able to generate ␣1g isoforms with a distinct
iii-iv loop. the isolation and tissue distribution of cdnas
encoding the various human ␣1g isoforms as well the investigation of their functional properties is now an important issue,
as demonstrated for the ␣1a isoforms that give rise to p/q ca2⫹
channel subtypes (14).
a common feature of the human and rodent ␣1g subunits, as
well as for the ␣1h and ␣1i subunits, is the absence of the
␤-subunit binding site, called aid (33), found in every hva ␣1
subtype. such data are consistent with previous experiments
showing that ␤-subunit knock-down using antisense strategies
does not affect t-type currents (34, 35). similarly, the g protein
␤␥ binding sites described in the non-l ␣1 subunits (36) are not
retrieved. this is also the case for the ca2⫹ binding and calmodulin binding domains involved in calcium dependent inactivation (37, 38). several putative phosphorylation sites for
 xxxg1836xxx , protein kinase c, and cam-kinase ii occur in
the sequence, but their functional relevance needs to be investigated. interestingly, the shortest isoform, ␣1g-b, lacks a putative  xxxg1836xxx /protein kinase c phosphorylation site
in the iii-iv loop.
based on the ␣1g-a isoform, the aa sequence of the iii-iv loop
is highly conserved among the three subunits ␣1g, ␣1h, and ␣1i,
which would suggest a conservation in function (75%; ref. 17).
it was proposed that this connecting loop might be important
for inactivation of t-type channels (17, 39) on the basis of that
described for na⫹ channels (40). however, although the vari-

cloning of the human t-type ca2⫹ channel ␣1g subunit

cellular resting potentials is hypothesized to play an important
physiological role, and new investigations should contribute to
determining the physiological relevance of t-type channel activity and aid in our interpretation of an increase in their
expression during fetal life and in pathophysiology.

rents (1 ␮m) recorded in the presence of 15 mm ba2⫹ (18).
amiloride seems to affect differentially ␣1g- (ic50 ⬎ 1 mm) and
␣1h-related currents (ic50 ⫽ 167 ␮m; ref. 18), although the
differences in the recording conditions should again be considered. similarly, we found a rather low sensitivity to ni2⫹ ions
of human ␣1g currents (ic50 ⫽ 150 ␮m), as compared with ␣1h
calcium channels for which an ic50 of 6 ␮m was reported (18).
one should note that the mouse ␣1g channel is blocked by an
even higher ni2⫹ concentration (ic50 ⬎ 1.1 mm in 20 mm ca2⫹;
ref. 31). nevertheless, discrepancies in the sensitivity to ni2⫹
ions are consistent with the data reported on native cells (2). it
is important to note that native t-type channels from brain
regions expressing a high level of ␣1g subunit exhibit low
sensitivity for ni2⫹ ions in good agreement with that described
for expressed ␣1g channels (2, 41, 46). a consequence of these
data is that the block by micromolar concentrations of ni2⫹
should not longer be considered as distinguishing lva from
hva channels (47).
a hallmark of t-type channels is the slow kinetics of their
current deactivation, and our data clearly show that the deactivation kinetics of the ca2⫹ current related to human ␣1g
channels is voltage-dependent. we further demonstrate that
the consequence of a slow deactivation process can be visualized using neuronal apws as a voltage clamp command. overexpression of t-type calcium channel in hek cells greatly
improves such investigations, and we show that apw stimulation (⬍2 ms) from cell’s resting potential values (⫺75 mv)
induces a sustained ca2⫹ current that occurs during repolarization and persists for more than 15 ms. the kinetics of this
ca2⫹ current is consistent with the kinetics of tail currents
evoked by a square-pulse with membrane repolarization at this
potential. as expected, this ca2⫹ influx is likely to be shaped by
the pattern of apws, such as duration, resting membrane
potential, and firing rate (48). deactivation is a feature that
distinguishes lva/t-type currents (␶ ⬃ 5 ms; ref. 2) from hva
currents (␶ ⬃ 0.3 ms; ref. 49). mccobb and beam (50) have
reported that distinct ca2⫹ signals are generated by lva and
hva channels in voltage clamp experiments using neuronal
apws. we show here that similar observations can be made
using pure populations of lva and hva channels, since apw
stimulation of hek cells expressing p-type channels (␣1a-a
isoform; ref. 14) induces a transient ca2⫹ influx overlapping
the apw duration. this ca2⫹ influx was ⬃7-fold smaller than
the one mediated by the ␣1g subunit. the ca2⫹ influx gated by
the ␣1g subunit is expected to play a specific role in excitability,
such as in the activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels (51). in addition, it is also important to note that steady
state activation and inactivation properties strongly support
evidence for a window current that occurs in a voltage range
close to membrane resting potentials (⫺65/⫺55 mv). this suggests a possible involvement of ␣1g/t-type current in ca2⫹
signaling at resting membrane potential, consistent with its
role in basal secretion of aldosterone in adrenal glomerulosa
cells (5). some other cellular functions including gene activation and cell proliferation, as well as critical developmental
stages and pathophysiological situations, would also depend on
a background ca2⫹ influx through t-type channels (7, 52–54).
overall, our expression studies have clearly demonstrated that
two specific properties of t-type channels, i.e. slow deactivation
and window current at cell resting potential, can be investigated on human ␣1g-channels. further experiments should
therefore explore in detail the specificities of the ca2⫹ signaling
generated by the various ␣1g isoforms, as well as for the ␣1h
and ␣1i subunits, possibly at the molecular level in structurefunction studies. a steady inward ca2⫹ current in the range of
