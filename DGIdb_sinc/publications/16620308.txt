summary
1. skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue that has a remarkable ability to adapt to external demands, such as exercise. many
of these adaptations can be explained by changes in skeletal
muscle gene expression. a single bout of exercise is sufficient to
induce the expression of some metabolic genes. we have focused
our attention on the regulation of glucose transporter isoform 4
( xxxg2135xxx ) expression in human skeletal muscle.
2. glucose transporter isoform 4 gene expression is increased
immediately following a single bout of exercise, and the  xxxg2135xxx 
enhancer factor (gef) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (mef2)
transcription factors are required for this response. glucose
transporter isoform enhancer factor and mef2 dna binding
activities are increased following exercise, and the molecular
mechanisms regulating mef2 in exercising human skeletal
muscle have also been examined.
3. these studies find possible roles for histone deacetylase
5 (hdac5),  xxxd81xxx –activated protein kinase
( xxxg1831xxx ),  xxxg1807xxx 
alpha (pgc-1alpha
alpha) and p38 mitogen-activated protein
coactivator 1alpha
kinase (mapk) in regulating mef2 through a series of complex
interactions potentially involving mef2 repression, coactivation
and phosphorylation.
4. given that mef2 is a transcription factor required for many
exercise responsive genes, it is possible that these mechanisms are
responsible for regulating the expression of a variety of metabolic
genes during exercise. these mechanisms could also provide targets
for the treatment and management of metabolic disease states, such
as obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
key words: exercise, gene expression,  xxxg2135xxx , histone

exercise, skeletal muscle and gene
expression
because of its large mass and intrinsic oxidative capacity, the skeletal
muscle is considered an important tissue in maintaining normal
whole-body metabolism and energy homeostasis. defects in skeletal
muscle function have been linked to diseases such as insulin
resistance1 and type 2 diabetes.2 skeletal muscle is a highly plastic
tissue that has a remarkable ability to adapt to external demands,
such as exercise. regular aerobic exercise is associated with enhanced
skeletal muscle oxidative capacity3 and insulin sensitivity.4 these
alterations in skeletal muscle metabolism can be explained in part by
changes in the expression of an array of metabolic genes. consequently,
much research of late has sought to examine the molecular mechanisms mediating exercise-induced gene expression. an exercise
responsive gene that has received considerable attention is the
glucose transporter isoform 4 ( xxxg2135xxx ) gene. this gene encodes
an insulin-regulated glucose transporter that is highly expressed in
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.5 glucose transporter isoform 4
gene expression is increased in the skeletal muscle immediately following a single bout of exercise.6,7 increasing the expression of this gene
is of particular interest, as overexpression of  xxxg2135xxx  exclusively in
the skeletal muscle improves whole-body insulin action and glucose
homeostasis.8,9 this phenomenon occurs despite the fact that  xxxg2135xxx 
expression is not compromised in diabetic skeletal muscle.10,11
this suggests that increasing  xxxg2135xxx  in skeletal muscle could be
an effective therapy in the treatment and management of disease
states such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

regulation of the glucose
transporter isoform 4 gene
from transgenic studies, it has been established that two conserved
regions on the  xxxg2135xxx  promoter are required for normal  xxxg2135xxx 
expression in the skeletal muscle. the first proximal region contains
a binding site for the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (mef2) transcription factor between base pairs −463 and −473.12 further studies suggest
that a mef2a/d heterodimer is required to bind to this site for
 xxxg2135xxx  expression.13 the second more distal region, termed domain
1, contains a binding domain for the newly identified  xxxg2135xxx  enhancer
factor (gef) transcription factor between base pairs −712 and −742.14
disruption of either of these binding sites results in reduced  xxxg2135xxx 
expression. a recent study has also found that mef2 and gef

physically interact to regulate the  xxxg2135xxx  gene.15 as a single bout
of exercise increases  xxxg2135xxx  gene expression, the effect of exercise
on the dna binding activities of both mef2 and gef in skeletal
muscle of human subjects following 60 min of cycling was examined. using electrophoretic mobility shift assays on nuclear extracts
from these samples, it was found that mef2 and gef dna binding
activity was increased (p < 0.05) 1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively.16
these results suggest that both mef2 and gef are important in
mediating the  xxxg2135xxx  response to exercise and that identifying the
upstream regulators of these transcription factors could be essential
in understanding  xxxg2135xxx  regulation. as gef has only recently been
discovered, very little is known of its regulation. however, mef2
regulation has been well characterized because of its role in myocyte
differentiation and t-cell proliferation. the mef2 family of transcription factors consists of four isoforms termed a, b, c and d and,
with the exception of mef2b, are highly expressed in mature
skeletal muscle.17 all mef2 isoforms contain a mads domain and
mef2 domain, found towards the amino terminus that mediates
dna binding and cofactor interactions and a transcriptional activation domain (tad) towards the carboxyl terminus.17 from a variety
of studies in various different cell types and systems, it appears that
mef2 regulation is a complex balance between corepression, coactivation and phosphorylation.

histone deacetylase 5 and myocyte
enhancer factor 2
in the basal state, mef2 is associated with the class ii histone
deacetylase (hdac) transcriptional repressors, which include isoforms 4, 5, 7 and 9.18 despite interacting with the mef2 dna binding domains, hdac repressors do not inhibit mef2 dna binding,
nor directly bind dna themselves. rather, hdacs inhibit transcription by deacetylating lysine side chains on chromatin-forming
histones.18 in the deacetylated state, positively charged histone tails
interact with the negatively charged dna phosphate backbone. this
close, electrostatic interaction physically restricts the access of
transcriptional activators to dna, thereby inhibiting transcription.19
histone acetylation reverses this situation, thereby allowing transcription to proceed. although mef2 and the hdac are physically
associated, mef2-mediated transcription is inhibited.20 dissociation
of the hdac from mef2 occurs following hdac phosphorylation.20
in cardiac myocytes, the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase iv ( xxxg330xxx ) phosphorylates hdac5 on serines 259 and
498, which dissociates hdac5 from mef2 and provides binding
sites for the 14-3-3 chaperone protein that results in hdac5 nuclear
export21 via a chromosome region maintenance 1 (crm1)-dependent
mechanism.22
given the importance of mef2 in the expression of  xxxg2135xxx  and
other exercise-responsive genes, this mechanism was examined in

human skeletal muscle after exercise.23 following 60 min of cycling,
hdac5 association with mef2 was reduced, as assessed through
co-immunoprecipitation on nuclear extracts from skeletal muscle
biopsies. this was associated with a decrease in nuclear hdac5,
with no change in whole-cell hdac5, suggesting that hdac5 was
exported from the nucleus. from these data, it appears that hdac5
indeed regulates mef2 during exercise in human skeletal muscle.
however, it appears that the putative hdac5 kinase,  xxxg330xxx , is
not expressed in human skeletal muscle.23,24 furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the  xxxg329xxx   xxxg330xxx  pathways in cardiac myocytes does
not inhibit the hdac5–mef2 regulatory mechanism,25 suggesting
that hdac5 could have multiple upstream kinases. this is supported
by studies showing that broad-specificity kinase inhibitors are
required to totally block hdac5 phosphorylation.25 however, a
potential hdac5 kinase could be the  xxxd81xxx –
activated protein kinase ( xxxg1831xxx ), which was recently observed to
translocate to the nucleus during exercise.26
 xxxd81xxx –activated protein kinase is a heterotrimer that is activated by decreases in the  xxxd83xxx /
 xxxd83xxx  (atp/amp) ratio through allosteric mechanisms and by phosphorylation of thr172 on its  xxxg216xxx  by
upstream kinases.27 exercise of intensities greater than approximately 60% of vo2peak activates  xxxg1831xxx  in human skeletal muscle.28
activation of  xxxg1831xxx  has been implicated in the regulation of glucose
uptake, fatty acid oxidation and gene expression.27 furthermore,
pharmacological activation of  xxxg1831xxx  using aicar is associated
with increased  xxxg2135xxx  expression.29–31
given that  xxxg330xxx  and  xxxg1831xxx  share similar substrate specificities, the ability of  xxxg1831xxx  to phosphorylate hdac5 was examined.
incubating hdac5 immunoprecipitated from human skeletal
muscle with isolated  xxxg1831xxx  in the presence of radiolabelled atp
resulted in hdac5 phosphorylation (s mcgee, k howlett and
m hargreaves, unpubl. obs.). this suggests that  xxxg1831xxx  could phosphorylate hdac5 during exercise, although it is possible that other
kinases are also involved and that  xxxg1831xxx  could regulate the glut4 gene through regulation of hdac5–mef2 interactions.

coactivation of myocyte
enhancer factor 2
following hdac5 dissociation, the acetylation state of chromatin
surrounding mef2 must be reversed for transcription to proceed.18
this process requires coactivators with intrinsic histone acetyl
transferase (hat) activity to be recruited to mef2.19 work in t cells
has established that the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated
t-cell (nfat) pathway, which is also present in skeletal muscle, could
mediate this response.18 calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin phosphatase that dephosphorylates nfat, which unmasks a nuclear
localization sequence and results in nfat nuclear translocation.32

exercise-induced gene expression

fig. 1 schematic diagram of the proposed regulation of myocyte enhancer
factor 2 (mef2) in contracting human
skeletal muscle. at rest, mef2 is
associated with histone deacetylase
5 (hdac5), which renders mef2
transcriptionally inactive. during
exercise, phosphorylation of hdac5
by  xxxd81xxx –activated
protein kinase ( xxxg1831xxx ) results in the
dissociation from mef2 and nuclear
export. peroxisome proliferator–
activated receptor gamma coactivator
1alpha (pgc-1alpha) associates with mef2
presumably to recruit cofactors with
hat activity to mef2. exercise increases nuclear p38 phosphorylation
and association with mef2. myocyte
enhancer factor 2 is phosphorylated on
various threonine residues in a mitogenactivated protein kinase (mapk)
sequence specific manner. these
events result in enhanced mef2
transcriptional activity.

once inside the nucleus, nfat is able to recruit coactivators with
intrinsic hat activity to mef2.18 although it is not clear if exercise
activates the calcineurin pathway, calcineurin has been implicated
in converting skeletal muscle fibre type to a slow twitch, oxidative
phenotype following prolonged muscle contraction.33
to investigate the role of the calcineurin pathway in the regulation
of mef2 and the  xxxg2135xxx  gene during exercise, the nuclear abundance of nfatc1 (nfat2), the most abundant isoform in skeletal
muscle,34 was examined following 60 min of exercise in humans.23
after exercise, the nuclear abundance of nfatc1 was unchanged
from resting levels. as the nuclear translocation of nfat is the
rate-limiting step in this pathway, these data could suggest that the
calcineurin/nfat pathway is not involved in the acute regulation of
mef2 during exercise. it should be noted, however, that other nfat
isoforms could be involved. nonetheless, it seems unlikely that this
pathway is involved, as calcineurin is sensitive to low amplitude, long
duration calcium transients,35 whereas muscle contraction elicits high
amplitude, short duration calcium transients.36
another potential transcriptional coactivator expressed in skeletal
muscle that could play a role in mef2 regulation is the peroxisome
proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (pgc-1alpha),

which is thought to be involved in the transcriptional response to
exercise, as overexpression of pgc-1alpha increases mitochondrial
biogenesis in cardiac muscle37 and slow-twitch fibre formation
in skeletal muscle,38 both of which are key adaptations to exercise.
although exercise increases pgc-1alpha expression39 in the acute
setting, pgc-1alpha regulates transcription by recruiting coactivators
with intrinsic hat activity to transcription factors such as the
nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( xxxg1557xxx ) and mef240 in a manner similar
to nfat. in the basal state, pgc-1alpha is associated with a repressor
protein. dissociation from the repressor occurs following phosphorylation of pgc-1alpha by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk).41 however, pgc-1alpha remains transcriptionally inactive
until it docks with a transcription factor, which stimulates a conformational change in pgc-1alpha that provides docking domains for
hat proteins.42 this suggests that pgc-1alpha must physically associate
with mef2 in order to regulate mef2-dependent genes. this mechanism has been examined in human skeletal muscle after exercise
using co-immunoprecipitation techniques.23 following 60 min of
exercise, mef2-associated pgc-1alpha was increased 3.7-fold. this
occurred without any change in the nuclear or total abundance of
pgc-1alpha protein, although a 1.8-fold increase in the phosphorylation

398

of nuclear p38 mapk was observed. although not assessed in that
study, this could suggest that pgc-1alpha was dissociated from its
repressor protein. the association of pgc-1alpha with mef2 could
mediate the changes in chromatin acetylation state, which is required
for active transcription. indeed, dissociation of hdac5 and
association of pgc-1alpha with mef2 was associated with an increase
in  xxxg2135xxx  mrna following exercise.23

myocyte enhancer factor 2
phosphorylation
although changes in chromatin acetylation state appear sufficient
to induce the transcription of some genes, phosphorylation of mef2
on its tad is able to dramatically increase the rate of mef2-mediated
transcription.43 in vitro experiments have established that the p38
mapk is able to phosphorylate mef2a on threonine residues 312
and 319 located within the tad, whereas mef2a is in a heterodimer
with mef2d.43 this is notable as it has been suggested that the
mef2a/d heterodimer is required for  xxxg2135xxx  expression.13
exercise is associated with activation of p38 mapk,44 and as stated
previously, an increase in p38 mapk phosphorylation has been
observed in nuclear extracts from human skeletal muscle following
exercise.23 it has also been hypothesized that p38 mapk could
participate in exercise-induced gene expression.45 crystallographic
studies have recently solved the docking domain necessary for
phosphorylation of mef2a by p38.46 this interaction was assessed in
human skeletal muscle after exercise. using co-immunoprecipitation, exercise increased mef2 associated p38  xxxg1366xxx .5-fold and
phosphorylated p38 mapk twofold.23 myocyte enhancer factor 2
phosphorylation was also assessed following mef2 immunoprecipitation using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes phosphorylated
threonine residues only when followed by a proline residue, similar
to thr312 and 319 on the mef2 tad. using this method, it was
found that exercise was associated with an approximate 2.7-fold
increase in mef2 thr-pro phosphorylation.23 although it is difficult
to determine the effect of mef2 phosphorylation on gene expression
in exercising humans, these data could provide a link between p38
mapk and  xxxg2135xxx  gene expression through the regulation of mef2.

conclusions
in summary, through analysis of mef2 regulation, we propose
a model of transcriptional regulation of  xxxg2135xxx  during exercise in
human skeletal muscle (fig. 1) that involves derepression by hdac5
following hdac5 phosphorylation by  xxxg1831xxx , coactivation by pgc1alpha and finally phosphorylation by p38 mapk. as consensus mef2
binding domains are found on the promoter regions of many exercise
responsive genes, it is possible that these same regulatory mechanisms
mediate many of the transcriptional responses to exercise. as such,
they could provide therapeutic targets for the treatment and management of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.
