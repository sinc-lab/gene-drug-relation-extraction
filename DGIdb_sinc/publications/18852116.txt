preclinical overview of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets both raf and vegf and pdgf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  signaling.  although patients with advanced refractory solid tumors have poor prognosis, the clinical development of targeted protein kinase inhibitors offers hope for the future treatment of many cancers. in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the oral multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib, inhibits tumor growth and disrupts tumor microvasculature through antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and/or proapoptotic effects. sorafenib has shown antitumor activity in phase ii/iii trials involving patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. the multiple molecular targets of sorafenib (the  xxxg1377xxx  raf and receptor tyrosine kinases) may explain its broad preclinical and clinical activity. this review highlights the antitumor activity of sorafenib across a variety of tumor types, including renal cell, hepatocellular, breast, and colorectal carcinomas in the preclinical setting. in particular, preclinical evidence that supports the different mechanisms of action of sorafenib is discussed.
