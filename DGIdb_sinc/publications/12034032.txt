mechanisms for regulation of cellular responsiveness
to human ifn-b1a

abstract
interferons (ifns) are potent, pleiotropic cytokines, and therefore it is likely that the cell has mechanisms to
modulate ifn activity in response to excessive or prolonged ifn exposure. to investigate this question, jurkat t cells were exposed to ifn-b1a in vitro. the effect of dose and frequency of ifn treatment on receptor
expression, the signal transduction pathway, and biologic activity was examined. results demonstrate that at
even modest doses of ifn (60 iu/ml), cell surface expression of the ifn receptor subunit,  xxxg1138xxx -1, decreased
significantly, and the cells were unresponsive to further ifn treatment. more interestingly, after an initial
treatment with very low concentrations of ifn (,10 iu/ml), even when receptor levels remained normal and
phosphorylation of signaling molecules occurred, cells were still refractory to further ifn treatment. after
withdrawal of ifn, full cellular responsiveness was a progressive but surprisingly slow process. cells retreated
2 days or 4 days after the initial ifn treatment were still refractory to even high doses (500 iu/ml) of ifn.
cells retreated 1 week after the initial ifn treatment were fully responsive. high levels of stat1 and  xxxg2214xxx 
correlated with the block in transcriptional activation of ifn-dependent genes and may be a mechanism by
which cells can downmodulate an ifn response. similar results were obtained when fresh peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc) were treated with ifn and expression of the endogenous ifn-dependent gene,
 xxxd2968xxx , was examined. cell surface levels of  xxxg1138xxx -1 decreased and stat1 levels increased after ifn-b treatment, and retreatment with ifn resulted in an attenuated induction of mx protein expression. in the context
of using ifns as therapeutic agents in the treatment of human disease, our data suggest that increasing the
amount or frequency of ifn administration may not yield desired biologic effects. thus, issues concerning
the dosage and the frequency of ifn-b administration deserve careful consideration.

introduction

i

(ifns ) exert their biologic effects by binding to a multicomponent cell surface receptor.(1,2) as a consequence of this binding, signaling molecules (signal transducers and activators of transcription [stat]) are activated and new
genes are transcribed.(3,4) the ifns comprise a group of proteins that exhibit antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities.(5) type i ifns (ifn-a, ifn-b, and ifn-v)
are produced by numerous types of cells, including various
leukocytes and fibroblasts.(6) in contrast, type ii ifn, commonly known as ifn-g, which is induced by immune and inflammatory stimuli, is primarily synthesized by t lymphocytes
and natural killer (nk) cells. ifns elicit their effects by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface membrane. the
binding of ifn-g to its cognate receptor,  xxxg1142xxx , and the subsequent signaling events have been the subject of intense
interferons

study.(7) indeed, the combined discoveries from several laboratories working on different aspects of ifn-g signaling have
culminated in the formulation of a receptor signaling model that
is currently one of the most complete.(7) the fine mechanistic
details of the type i ifn signaling pathway, however, are as yet
poorly understood.
the human type i ifns are a family of related molecules, all
of which bind to a common receptor complex.(8–11) it has been
shown that the functional type i ifn receptor,  xxxg1138xxx , has a
multichain structure composed of at least two distinct subunits,
 xxxg1138xxx -1 and  xxxg1138xxx -2.(12) the  xxxg1138xxx -2 chain is the binding
subunit. the  xxxg1138xxx -1 chain, which on its own binds most type
i ifns weakly at best, increases the binding affinity of ifn to
the receptor complex by about 10-fold.(13)  xxxg1138xxx -1 also contributes to the differential recognition of type i ifns by the
 xxxg1138xxx -1/ xxxg1138xxx -2 complex(13,14) and is critical for signal
transduction. all type i ifns activate receptor-associated tyro-

sine kinases,  xxxg1219xxx  and  xxxg2364xxx , which in turn activate a series of
latent, cytoplasmic transcriptional activator proteins known as
stat.(15)  xxxg1138xxx -1 associates with  xxxg2364xxx , and  xxxg1138xxx -2 associates with  xxxg1219xxx , stat1, and  xxxg2214xxx .(16) the ifn-mediated association of the two receptor subunits facilitates the cross-phosphorylation and activation of  xxxg2364xxx  and  xxxg1219xxx , which in turn
phosphorylate y466 of  xxxg1138xxx -1. the phosphorylated receptor
subunit provides a docking site for the sh2 domain of stat1,
positioning the protein for phosphorylation on y701. therefore,
the  xxxg1138xxx -1 subunit of the receptor complex performs a pivotal role in the activation of stat1 and the overall process of
signal transduction.
one important area of research in the ifn field concerns the
modulation of the ifn response. under normal circumstances,
when the cell is exposed to very low levels of ifn for a short
time, modulation occurs in several ways. for instance, the  xxxg1141xxx  signal transduction pathway, which is normally activated by
phosphorylation, can be shut off by the induction and activation of specific phosphatases.(17) also, after ifn-g binds to its
receptor, the receptor/ligand complex gets internalized and degraded.(17) as it is critical with such potent, pleiotropic molecules that the body can maintain homeostasis in the event of
excess or prolonged exposure to ifn (e.g., with chronic treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms) with ifn-b), it was of interest
to understand the various regulatory mechanisms for type i ifn
activity.
cellular responses to other cytokines also provide interesting models of functional downregulation using various strategies. monocytes exhibit a reduction in interleukin-6 (il-6)
receptor mrna levels on exposure to the ligand.(18)
myelomonocytic cells tightly control the action of il-1 by expressing membrane-bound or soluble, nonfunctional receptors
that act as molecular traps for il-1.(19) other cytokines, such
as ifn-g, use a multitude of such negative regulatory strategies. ifn-g can induce desensitization by downregulating the
expression of  xxxg1142xxx -2 mrna and protein.(20,21) in addition,
ifn-g induces the expression of a family of proteins termed
socs/jab/ssi ( xxxg466xxx /jak-binding
protein/stat-induced stat inhibitor-1), which bind to and inhibit
activated jak and desensitize cells in either a homologous or a
heterologous manner.(22–24) the object of this study was to determine if similar or novel regulatory mechanisms apply to the
type i ifn signaling pathway.
in this study, we examined the extent of ifn-induced gene
expression on extended exposure to recombinant ifn-b1a. it
was shown that cells can become less responsive after repeated
exposure to ifn-b1a and that this decrease in responsiveness
correlates both quantitatively and temporarily with the increased expression of stat1.

materials and methods
cell culture and antibodies
jurkat clone e6.1 cells (american type culture collection,
tib-152) were grown in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (fbs) (jrh biotechnologies, lenexa, ks),
10 mm hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. anti- xxxg1138xxx  and anti- xxxg1138xxx -2 antibodies were raised

in mice as previously described.(25) all other antibodies were
purchased from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma). the
recombinant ifn-b1a is produced at biogen inc. (cambridge,
ma) and marketed under the commercial name avonex™. cycloheximide (calbiochem, la jolla, ca) was dissolved in ethyl
alcohol (aldrich, milwaukee, wi) and used at a final concentration of 5 mm.
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were
isolated from whole blood of healthy donors. separation was
achieved by density gradient centrifugation using  xxxd3253xxx -paque
(amersham pharmacia biotech, paris, france). whole blood
(25 ml) was loaded onto 15 ml  xxxd3253xxx -paque in uni-sep maxi1
separation columns (accurate chemical & scientific corp.,
westbury, ny). tubes were spun at 2000 rpm for 30 min. the
mononuclear layer was aspirated and washed with 50 ml complete rpmi medium containing 10% fbs. cells were plated
and kept at 37°c, 5%co2.

facs analysis
to evaluate cell surface expression levels of  xxxg1138xxx -1 and
 xxxg1138xxx -2, jurkat e6.1 cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) and resuspended in 100 ml cold facs
buffer (rpmi 1640 with 1% fbs and 0.1% sodium azide). for
each sample, 5 3 105 cells were incubated for 1 h on ice in
facs medium containing 10 mg/ml anti- xxxg1138xxx -1 (or antiifnar-2) antibody. cells were washed with facs medium
and incubated on ice for 45 min in 100 ml r-pe-conjugated
f(ab9)2 goat antimouse igg (biosource international, camarillo, ca) (1:100 in facs medium). cells were washed, suspended in 350 ml facs medium, and analyzed using a becton
dickinson facscalibur (mountain view, ca).

rna isolation and rt-pcr analysis
total rna was isolated from 5 3 106 jurkat e6.1 cells using qiagen minicolumns (chatsworth, ca) and adjusted to a
concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in water. reverse transcription was
performed using promega’s reverse transcription system kit
(madison, wi). total rna (1.5 mg) was transcribed to cdna
using oligo (dt) primers and amv reverse transcriptase enzyme (promega). stat1-specific primers were used for the pcr
reaction. the oligonucleotide sequences of the stat1 primer set
(forward and reverse) were 59-agg ata att ttc agg
aag ac-39 and 59-cct gat taa atc tct ggg cg-39.
pcr products were run on a 2% metaphor agarose gel (biowhittaker, inc., rockland, me).

transient transfections and reporter gene assays
for reporter gene assays, jurkat e6.1 cells were transfected
at 80% confluence in 6-well plates in triplicate with expression plasmids encoding an ifn-dependent luciferase gene.
pisre-luc (path detect isre cis-reporting system) (stratagene, la jolla, ca) or a control vector, pcis-ck, in addition to a plasmid encoding a constitutively active secreted alkaline phosphatase (seap) gene pcmv seap (tropix,
bedford, ma) were transfected in jurkat e6.1 cells using liposome-based transfection reagent fugene-6 (roche, nutley,
nj). total dna transfected was kept constant  xxxd1891xxx  mg per
well. six hours after transfection, cells were supplemented

with fresh medium containing 500 iu/ml ifn-b1a and cultured for another 18 h. cells were rinsed with pbs and resuspended in lysis buffer (promega), and luciferase activity
was measured using a commercially available bright-glo assay kit (promega). seap was measured using a chemiluminescent assay (tropix phospha-light kit) and was used as a
measure of transfection efficiency.

cell extracts and sds-page
whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in a 23
sds sample buffer (novex™) supplemented with an equal volume of ripa buffer (1% np-40, 1%  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sds,
150 mm nacl, and 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.0). samples were

boiled briefly, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation (14,000 rpm) for 10 min. supernatants were then heated
at 90°c for 5 min and subjected to sds-page on a 10% polyacrylamide gel.

western blotting
proteins were transferred following electrophoresis to a
pvdf membrane (novex) by electroblotting for 2 h at 12 v in
transfer buffer from novex. the blots were blocked in 5% dry
milk in tris-buffered saline (tbst) (10 mm tris, 150 mm
nacl, ph 7.5, with 0.1% tween-20) for 2 h at ambient temperature, with gentle agitation. blots were incubated with a
1:2000 dilution of the primary antibody (cell signaling tech-

ifn-b1a for a period of 24 h prior to analysis. cell surface levels of the ifn receptor subunits were measured using a flow cytometry-based assay. either a mouse antihuman  xxxg1138xxx -1 or  xxxg1138xxx -2 antibody and then a goat antimouse f(ab)2 carrying a fluorescent tag were used to label the receptor molecules exposed on the surface membrane. in each case, the receptor density from

nology) for 2–3 h, washed with tbst, and incubated for 1 h
with horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated secondary antibody (antirabbit hrp-conjugated antibody) (cell signaling
technology). the blots were washed again with tbst and developed using the ecl western blot detection system (cell signaling technology).

results
the immortalized t lymphocyte cell line, jurkat e6.1, was
used to study the effects of dose and frequency of ifn treatment on cellular responsiveness to further ifn exposure. initially, cells were treated with modest concentrations (60–1000
iu/ml) of avonex, a recombinant human ifn-b (ifn-b1a), for
a period of 24 h, and cell surface receptor levels were analyzed
using flow cytometry. these doses include physiologically relevant concentrations, because when ms patients are treated
with ifn-b1a, levels in peripheral blood range from 5 to 100
iu/ml.(26–28) a reduction in the surface density of  xxxg1138xxx -1 on
exposure to increasing concentrations of ifn-b1a was observed
(fig. 1a). the decrease in cell surface  xxxg1138xxx -1 was inhibited
by low temperatures (4°c) and the presence of azide, suggesting energy-dependent internalization as a major mechanism for
the loss of  xxxg1138xxx -1 (data not shown). this effect appeared to
be specific to  xxxg1138xxx -1, as only a minimal reduction in the surface density of  xxxg1138xxx -2, the second subunit of the receptor
heterodimer complex, was seen (fig. 1a). however, our flow
cytometry-based assay could not distinguish between the two
membrane-bound forms of  xxxg1138xxx -2 ( xxxg1138xxx -2b [short, unknown function],  xxxg1138xxx -2c [long, signaling-competent]).

therefore, it remains a possibility that the remaining ifnar2 was mainly the inactive short form. the levels of other surface markers, such cd3 and  xxxg1142xxx  were unaffected (fig. 1b)
by treatment with even relatively high doses of ifn-b1a. as
expected, mhc i expression was upregulated by ifn-b1a treatment.(29)
the effect of ifn-b dose on transcription of ifn-inducible
genes was examined by monitoring the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a promoter (isre) that is specific
to type i ifns. cells were transfected with the isre-luciferase
(pisre-luc)-containing plasmid, allowed to recover for 6–8 h,
and then treated with different doses of ifn-b. figure 1c shows
that the isre-luciferase plasmid was not transcribed in the absence of ifn-b and was transcribed in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of ifn-b.
to determine how the ifn-induced reduction in cell surface
levels of  xxxg1138xxx -1 affected the ifn signal transduction pathway, expression of the isre-luciferase reporter gene was assessed in cells that had been pretreated with the same concentrations of ifn-b as in the experiment shown in figure 1. jurkat
cells were incubated with 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, or 1000 iu/ml
ifn-b for 24 h, washed, and transfected with the isre-luciferase plasmid. the cells were stimulated with a second dose of
ifn-b1a (500 iu/ml) 6–8 h after transfection. eighteen hours
later, the cells were analyzed for luciferase activity. the ifndependent expression of luciferase was dramatically reduced
when cells had been pretreated with ifn-b, even at the lowest
dose of 62.5 iu/ml (fig. 2a). this result was specific to the
ifn-b pathway, as these ifn-b-pretreated cells were still competent for expression of a non-ifn-dependent reporter gene,
cmv seap (secreted alkaline phosphatase) plasmid (fig. 2a).

24 h. after this initial treatment period, 5 3 106 cells were transfected with either the isre-luciferase reporter plasmid or the
transfection control plasmid containing a secreted alkaline phosphatase gene (seap) downstream of the cytomegalovirus (cmv)
promoter sequence. transfected cells were then challenged with 500 iu/ml ifn-b1a. eighteen hours later, cells were lysed, and
luciferase enzymatic activity was measured using the bright-glo luciferase assay system. seap levels were measured from the
supernatants as per the manufacturer’s protocol. naive cells remained untreated during the initial 24-h period. untransfected cells
did not contain the reporter plasmid and provided a value for the background level of fluorescence inherent to the assays. (b)
kinetics of ifn resistance. jurkat cells were treated with 50 iu/ml ifn-b1a for 1, 3, 8, or 24 h. cells from each treatment group
were transfected with the isre-luciferase reporter plasmid for a period of 6 h and then challenged with 500 iu/ml fresh ifnb1a. luciferase activity was assessed 18 h later and is expressed as the percent of untreated cells.

regulation of cell response to huifn-b1a
pretreatment of at least 8 h was required to effectively render
the cells refractory to a secondary challenge of ifn (fig. 2b).
the extent of inhibition of ifn-dependent transcription at
the lowest pretreatment dose of ifn-b (i.e., 62.5 iu/ml) was
particularly interesting. as illustrated in figures 1a and 2a,
cells pretreated with 62.5 iu/ml ifn-b showed only a 50% reduction in cell surface  xxxg1138xxx -1, whereas transcriptional activation of the isre-luciferase plasmid was reduced by 80%. to
more carefully determine the relationship between  xxxg1138xxx -1
cell surface expression and downstream activation of the ifn
signal transduction pathway, a lower range of pretreatment
doses was used. figure 3a and b show that inhibition of ifndependent transcription does not correlate with cell surface expression levels of  xxxg1138xxx -1. in fact, at the lowest concentration of ifn-b tested (7.8 iu/ml),  xxxg1138xxx -1 levels were virtually
unchanged (fig. 3a), whereas ifn-dependent gene expression

495
was dramatically reduced (fig. 3b). this uncoupling of  xxxg1138xxx  levels and gene expression was further explored by examining the phosphorylation state of several of the signaling molecules known to be involved in the ifn pathway. figure 3c
shows that when cells are retreated with ifn-b, activation of
the signaling molecules (i.e., phosphorylation) correlated well
with cell surface levels of  xxxg1138xxx -1 but not with transcriptional
activation. when  xxxg1138xxx -1 levels were .80%, full phosphorylation could occur, but gene expression was almost completely
inhibited. when  xxxg1138xxx -1 levels drop below 50% (e.g., at 62.5
iu/ml), phosphorylation of signaling molecules is reduced. as
expected, cells that had not been treated with ifn showed no
basal phosphorylation of stat1,  xxxg2214xxx , stat3, or  xxxg2364xxx , and when
ifn-treated cells were examined .24 h postexposure, no residual phosphorylation was seen (data not shown). thus, these
data suggest that a mechanism(s) other than cell surface levels

of the receptor subunit  xxxg1138xxx -1 were measured after 24 h of treatment with the indicated concentrations of ifn-b using the
flow cytometry-based assay. (b) ifn-inducible luciferase reporter assay. after the 24-h initial treatment period with 0–62.5 iu/ml
ifn-b, the jurkat e6.1 cells were washed and transfected with an isre-luciferase reporter plasmid for a period of 6 h and then
rechallenged with 500 iu/ml fresh ifn-b1a. luciferase activity was assessed 18 h later. (c) ifn-induced phosphorylation of receptor-associated molecules. after the 24-h initial treatment period with 0–62.5 iu/ml ifn-b, the jurkat e6.1 cells were washed

fresh ifn-b1a for an additional 15 min and lysed in sample buffer. the total levels and phosphorylation status of stat1,  xxxg2214xxx ,
stat3, and  xxxg2364xxx  were assessed by western blot analysis.

of the ifn receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling
molecules can regulate a cell’s ability to respond to ifn treatment.
interestingly, of the parameters that were investigated, it was
a striking increase in total stat1 and, to a lesser extent,  xxxg2214xxx 
levels that correlated best with the inhibition of ifn-dependent
transcription (fig. 3c). at pretreatment concentrations of 7.8
iu/ml, the level of total stat1 protein was significantly increased.  xxxg2214xxx  levels also increased, although not as dramatically as stat1 levels. the kinetics of this increase in total stat1
levels is shown in figure 4a. by 8 h post-ifn-b treatment (50
iu/ml), the levels were significantly elevated. figure 1c shows
that the kinetics of the inhibition of ifn-induced gene expression is very similar to that seen with stat1 levels. when cells
had been pretreated with 50 iu/ml ifn-b for at least 8 h, the
ifn-dependent induction of luciferase was reduced by .50%.
in order to compare mrna levels with the protein levels, the
kinetics of stat1 mrna expression is shown in figure 4b. the
peak levels of stat1 mrna do not seem to correlate with stat1
protein levels or with mx mrna levels (a known, tightly regulated ifn-stimulated gene [isg]). as a control, the kinetics of
stat1 phosphorylation is shown in figure 4c. after ifn treatment with high doses of ifn-b (500 iu/ml), phosphostat1 levels increase rapidly (15 min) and are virtually back to baseline
after 4 h.
to determine how long ifn-treated cells remain refractory
to further ifn treatment, cells that had been exposed to various relatively low (7.8–125 u/ml) doses of ifn were retreated
at either 48, 96, or 168 h after the initial treatment, and subsequent expression of the isre-luciferase plasmid was assessed.
the cells were retreated with the higher dose of ifn-b (500
iu/ml) in order to observe the maximal effect of the retreatment. figure 5 shows that 48 h after pretreatment (even with
low doses of ifn), the cells were only partially responsive to
retreatment with ifn-b. for example, after a physiologic dose
of ,30 iu/ml, the cell’s response to a second dose of ifn was
reduced by 60% compared with cells that had not received a
pretreatment. ninety-six hours after the initial ifn treatment,
cells were still only partially responsive (50% responsive to a
second dose after an initial treatment of ,30 iu/ml). by 168 h
(1 week) after the initial treatment, the cells had regained full
responsiveness to treatment with ifn-b. stat1 levels correlated
well with cellular responsiveness; while stat1 levels remained
elevated, ifn-dependent transcription remained low, and when
stat1 levels returned to pretreatment amounts, the cells were
fully responsive to further ifn treatment.
an experiment to determine the effect of repeated ifn treatment is shown in figure 6. figure 6a is a schematic of the experimental protocol. figure 6b shows that when cells are treated
three times per week with 500 iu/ml ifn-b, stat1 levels remain high. figure 6c demonstrates that  xxxg1138xxx -1 levels remain
repressed as a result of frequent treatment with ifn-b. these
findings suggest that frequent dosing of cells with ifn-b might
inhibit, rather than increase, the cellular response.
the experiments described above utilized an immortalized
t cell line and an exogenously added ifn-inducible reporter
gene and were performed in vitro. as an initial step to determine if these findings can be extrapolated to in vivo situations,

was examined. within this blood fraction are numerous cell
types that respond to ifn-b and that are thought to mediate
many of the therapeutic effects of ifn-b in ms. thus, pbmc
were isolated and pretreated with ifn-b (100 iu/ml) or vehicle control. after 48 h, half of each sample was challenged with
another dose of ifn, and the expression of  xxxd2968xxx  was assessed
by western blot (fig. 7a). the results obtained with these primary human cells were consistent with the jurkat t cell line
findings in that pbmc appear to regulate the type i ifn signaling pathway in a manner similar to that of the jurkat cells.

though levels of  xxxd2968xxx  were still elevated 48 h after the initial
treatment (fig. 7a, lane 3), retreatment did not induce a response even equivalent to that seen in naive cells (fig. 7a, compare lane 4 with lane 2). further indications that the jurkat system is predictive for in vivo models come from the observation
that with treatment of pbmc with high doses of ifn (500
iu/ml),  xxxg1138xxx -1 is downregulated and total stat1 levels are
upregulated to an extent similar to that observed with the jurkat cells pretreated with 500 iu/ml ifn-b (fig. 7b, c).

discussion
cells frequently undergo a process of desensitization in response to almost any type of stimulus. in this study, we demonstrate that t cells become desensitized as a result of persistent ifn-b1a stimulation.
adaption to extracellular signals can occur in various ways.
in some cases, it results from a decrease in the number of specific cell surface receptors, which can take hours to complete.
a more rapid adaptation response can result from a molecular
change in the receptor or in any downstream component of the
signaling pathway. although the observation that at the level
of transcription, cells become desensitized to further ifn-a

treatment has been reported,(30) the mechanistic details of how
cells adapt to excessive, prolonged, or repeated exposure to
ifn-b are not well understood. the experiments reported here
begin to address this question.
jurkat cells and a reporter gene were used as a model system. jurkat cells were selected because they are derived from
t cells, which are among the targets of ifn immunodulatory
action in vivo. when examining the cell’s response to repeated
ifn treatment, a reporter gene was used in order to obtain a
snapshot of the cell’s responsiveness without the confounding
background levels of previously induced endogenous gene
products. by tracing the pathway of ifn-b-mediated signaling
in mammalian cells, several points where negative regulation
could occur (e.g., cell surface receptor levels, activation of signal transduction molecules, and ifn-dependent transcription)
were examined. treating jurkat cells with increasing concentrations of ifn-b resulted in a dose-dependent loss of the ifn
receptor subunit,  xxxg1138xxx -1, from the cell surface membrane
even at concentrations that are routinely achieved in therapeutic settings (fig. 1). initially, it was assumed that a decrease in
both the activation (i.e., phosphorylation) of signaling molecules and the transcription of an ifn-inducible reporter gene
would correlate with this receptor downregulation. however,
when lower concentrations of ifn-b were tested, a discrepancy
between receptor levels and transcription was observed. when

and incubated for 24 h with 500 iu/ml ifn-b1a (37°c, 5% co2 ). cells were then washed and resuspended in fresh medium.
cells in the 13 treatment group received only the initial ifn-b treatment. cells in the 33 treatment group received two additional doses of 500 iu/ml at 48 h and 96 h. (a) a schematic of the experiment. (b) western analysis of stat1 levels. cells were

expression levels of  xxxg1138xxx -1 following once a week or three times a week treatment. cell surface levels of the  xxxg1138xxx -1 receptor subunit were measured at each time point by flow cytometric analysis.

cells were pretreated with extremely low amounts of ifn-b,
normal cell surface receptor levels were maintained. when
these cells were retreated with ifn-b, despite the activation of
signal transduction molecules (as determined by tyrosine phosphorylation), ifn-dependent transcription of the ifn-dependent reporter gene was strikingly reduced (fig. 3).
although there are several possible mechanisms that could
mediate this desensitization, some of the best-studied regulatory mediators (such as  xxxg466xxx  [soc]
or phosphatases) are unlikely candidates, as tyrosine phosphorylation of the stat still occurred in the unresponsive cells. although the exact mechanism of the desensitization has yet to
be determined, an intriguing correlation between levels of total stat1 and  xxxg2214xxx  and cellular responsiveness was observed.
cells treated with low doses of ifn-b have a marked and sustained increase in the cellular content of stat1, a key component of the ifn signaling pathway. this increase in stat1 levels correlated with a decrease in expression of the ifn-inducible

reporter gene both temporally and quantitatively (compare figs.
1c and 4a). this correlation did not hold true with respect to
stat1 mrna, which remains at a relatively steady-state after
ifn treatment. this was not the case with mx, a classic type i
ifn isg.  xxxg2214xxx  levels were also elevated in the desensitized
cells but did not correlate with desensitization as well as stat1
did. the role of stat1 in ifn-a/b or ifn-g signaling has been
established unequivocally through the generation and characterization of mice with targeted disruptions of the stat1 gene.(31)
cells from stat1-null mice are incapable of manifesting biologic responses to ifn-a/b or ifn-g. the involvement of stat1
in positive, negative, and constitutive regulation of gene expression has been well studied. for example, in a study by chen
et al., there is a tight correlation between high levels of stat1
and insensitivity to ifn-g.(32) these authors suggest that increases in stat1 levels serve as a mechanism for attenuating the
effects of persistent exposure to ifn-g on cellular processes,
perhaps by direct impairment of ifn-g signal transduction or

regulation of cell response to huifn-b1a

left in fresh medium for 24 h to recover. pretreated or untreated cells were challenged with 100 u/ml ifn-b1a for an additional
24 h prior to lysis. the level of  xxxd2968xxx  was measured by western blot analysis. (b) pbmc were treated with 500 iu/ml ifn-b.
cell surface levels of the receptor subunit  xxxg1138xxx -1 were measured using a flow cytometric assay. (c) pbmc were pretreated

cells were lysed with sample buffer 15 min after challenge, and the levels and phosphorylation status of stat1 were measured by
western blot analysis.
by cross-talk with other cytokine signaling pathways.(32) in the
chen et al. study (as in our own) the cells did not regain their
responsiveness to ifn-g until the cytokine had been absent for
approximately 6 days.(32)
our investigation of stat1 levels in cells exposed to ifn-b revealed a similar specific, drug-induced increase in protein levels
as early as 4 h after treatment. it is possible that the modulation
of stat1 levels may serve as a general mechanism for diminishing the effects of ifns on gene expression. the observed increases
in  xxxg2214xxx  levels may also have an effect on alterations of gene expression. the mechanism by which the excess of stat proteins
could exert negative effects on ifn responsiveness is unclear.
however, two reasonable possibilities include the excess stat remaining in the cytosol and competing with phosphorylated stat
in their binding to other proteins or by translocating to the nucleus and binding dna as a transcriptional repressor.(33,34)
the phenomenon of desensitization in the context of repeated, frequent dosing was also addressed. figure 5 shows that

jurkat cells are not fully responsive to a second dose of ifn
even 4 days after the initial treatment. after a full week, the
cells are fully responsive once again. even more relevant for
some patients is the experiment shown in figure 6, where cells
were treated to mimic a three times a week dosing schedule. in
this case, stat1 levels remained high, and  xxxg1138xxx -1 levels remained relatively suppressed.
in order to begin to examine if the results obtained in the
jurkat cell-reporter gene system will extend to more physiologic situations, primary pbmc were used. in these cells (unlike the jurkat cells), the turnover of  xxxd2968xxx  protein was relatively rapid, thereby allowing an assessment of the effects of
repeated dosing on the transcriptional activation of an ifninducible gene. although both protein (fig. 7a) and mrna
levels (data not shown) were examined, from a therapeutic perspective, it is the actual gene products that are most relevant.
the results of the preliminary experiments with the pbmc (fig.
7) are consistent with the results obtained in the jurkat cells.

dupont et al.

cell surface  xxxg1138xxx -1 levels can decrease after ifn treatment,
stat1 levels increase, and pretreatment of the cells with ifn
causes a desensitization of ifn-dependent gene expression.
the phenomenon of cellular desensitization as a consequence
of high or repeated exposure to cytokines is well documented.
the observations reported here with ifn-b raise issues concerning the impact of aggressive ifn-b treatment regimens in
clinical settings. ifns were discovered on the basis of their antiviral activities. a variety of cells produce ifns in response to
infections by various viruses, bacteria, and mycoplasma.(35,36)
in addition to these effects, however, ifns exhibit pleiotropic
biologic activities, such as antitumor and immunomodulatory
effects. consequently, the use of ifns in treatment of human
disease has become prevalent. for instance, ifn-b is currently
used for the treatment of ms.(37) ms is a t cell-mediated disease of the central nervous system in which activated macrophages effectively demyelinate the neuronal tissue. the most
compelling hypothesis concerning the immunologic basis of the
therapeutic effect of ifn-b involves stimulating a th2 shift
whereby secretions of protective and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., il-10) help suppress the effector cells.(38,39) therefore, the ability of cytokine-secreting cells to respond to  xxxg1140xxx  is of paramount importance in mediating its therapeutic
effects. in this context, the data in this report suggest that increasing the amount or frequency of ifn administration may
not yield the desired biologic effects.(40) further experiments
to explore the consequences of frequent ifn administration in
patients are underway.
