1. introduction
 xxxd2980xxx  (1) is a naturally occurring aryltetralin
lignan obtained from a number of plant species of the
 xxxd2980xxx  family.1,2 it has cytotoxic properties and
is known as an antimicrotubule agent acting at the colchicine-binding site on tubulin. however, the semisynthetic
derivatives of  xxxd2980xxx , namely etoposide3,4 (2)
and teniposide5 (3), inhibit dna topoisomerase-ii
(topo-ii) by stabilizing the covalent topo-ii dna cleavable complex.6 both these compounds are in clinical
usage for the treatment of various cancers including small
cell lung cancer, testicular carcinoma, and lymphoma.3,7
their therapeutic use has encountered certain limitations
such as acquired drug resistance and poor water solubility. to overcome such problems, extensive synthetic efforts have been carried out by a number of researchers.
this led to the development of  xxxd2068xxx  (4), nk 611
(5), and gl 331 (6).  xxxd2068xxx  is a water-soluble prodrug which readily converts into the active drug and
exhibits similar biological proﬁle to that of etoposide.7b,7c
the other analogs of  xxxd2980xxx  like nk 611 (5)
and gl 331 (6) are in diﬀerent stages of clinical studies.

during the course of preparing new c-4-nonsugar derivatives of  xxxd2980xxx , it has been observed that the
n-linked congeners like gl 331 (6) and npf (7) have
exhibited improved cytotoxicity and topo-ii inhibition
activity (fig. 1).4a,5,8 a recent study on molecular-areaoriented chemical modiﬁcations of  xxxd2980xxx  has
revealed certain structural features that are critical for
the topo-ii inhibition.9 the comparative molecular ﬁeld
analysis 8b,9 model further demonstrated that bulky substituents at c-4 might be favorable for topo-ii inhibition
(fig. 2). recently, we have been involved in the development of new synthetic procedures10 for the  xxxd2980xxx -based compounds and also in the design and
synthesis of new analogs of  xxxd2980xxx  as potential
anticancer agents.11 in conjunction with these eﬀorts, it
was of interest to prepare 4b-(200 -benzoyl) anilino- and
4b-imido-substituted  xxxd2980xxx  analogs12 with
the objective to enhance their topo-ii inhibition as well
as in vitro anticancer activity particularly by increasing
the bulkiness at the c-4 position.
2. chemistry
the synthesis of c-4b-substituted analogs of  xxxd2980xxx  has been carried out from  xxxd2980xxx  (1).
the key intermediate for the preparation of the new
analogs is 4b-bromopodophyllotoxin/4b-bromo-4 0 demethylpodophyllotoxin (8) that was obtained by a

previously reported method13 employing hbr in dichloromethane. the intermediate (8) thus obtained has been
utilized for the synthesis of the ﬁnal target molecules
10a–j and 11a–e. compounds 10a–j are obtained by
coupling of 8 with substituted 2-aminobenzophenones
employing bu4ni, and net3 in tetrahydrofuran (thf)
at room temperature in good yields (40–70%), whereas
coupling of 8 with various imides like succinimide,
phthalimide, and naphthalimide using bu4ni, and
net3 in thf at room temperature gives the corresponding 4b-imido-substituted  xxxd2980xxx  analogs
(11a–e) in 30% yield (scheme 1).

u251. the screening procedure is based on the routine
method adopted by nci as described in the previous report.11a these analogs of  xxxd2980xxx  (10a–j and
11a–d) have exhibited an interesting proﬁle of in vitro
anticancer activity. the compound 10j having c1 and f
substituents in 4b-(200 -benzoyl) anilino-substituted series
is highly potent against all the cancer cell lines and similarly 11d has exhibited very high in vitro anticancer activity
(tables 1 and 2). however, the cytotoxicity (ic50 in kb
cell lines) of compound 6 has been reported5 as 1.3 lm.
on the basis of the in vitro anticancer activity, 10j has
been investigated for its in vivo activity but unfortunately
this compound has problems of bioavailability.

3. biological evaluation

some representative compounds in the 4b-anilino series
(10a, 10c, 10e, and 10g) have been evaluated in the 60
cancer cell line assay of nci (table 3). interestingly,
both the 4 0 -o-methyl and the 4 0 -o-demethyl analogs
exhibited good in vitro anticancer activity. as demonstrated by the mean graph pattern for compound 10c

these 4b-anilino- and 4b-imido-substituted  xxxd2980xxx  analogs have been tested for their cytotoxic activities against six human cancer cell lines that comprise of
du145, ht29, mcf7, mcf7adr, ncih460, and

scheme 1. reagents and conditions: (i) hbr, ch2cl2, 0 °c, 45 min (8a); hbr, ch2cl2, 0 °c, rt, 48 h (8b); (ii) bu4ni, et3n, thf, rt; (iii) succinimide,
phthalimide, naphthalimide, bu4ni, et3n, thf, rt.

(fig. 3), it is seen that it exhibits not only signiﬁcant
activity but also more sensitivity for certain cancer cell
lines. therefore, from the structure–activity relationship
point of view, it is not clear about the role played by this
functionality. in literature, it has been observed that
demethylation of the 4 0 -methoxy moiety eliminates antimitotic activity but there is no clarity about its relationship for the topo-ii inhibition activity. for the
 xxxd2980xxx  lignans, dna topo-ii is the pharmacological target of clinical relevance; therefore, some representative compounds have been evaluated for its
inhibition. most of the compounds (e.g., 10b, 10g, 10j,
and 11d) exhibited comparable in vitro inhibition of
topo-ii catalytic activity to  xxxd168xxx  and the results
are illustrated in figure 4. the topo-ii-mediated relaxation assay performed is according to the previous
procedure.14
4. conclusion
in summary, the newly designed and synthesized c-4modiﬁed  xxxd2980xxx  congeners exhibit promising
in vitro cytotoxic activities in a number of human cancer

cell lines. two of the compounds from this series exhibited interesting dna topo-ii inhibition activity, suggesting that these new molecules also exhibit biological
activity based on this mechanism similar to the etoposide prototypes. further, these results agree with the
hypothesis that the bulky substitution at c-4 position
can enhance the activity proﬁle for this class of compounds. this investigation suggests that these  xxxd2980xxx  congeners irrespective of their interaction with
dna possess potential in vitro anticancer activity.
moreover, eﬀorts are in progress to improve the bioavailability of these compounds.

10 nm) against six human cancer cell lines comprised
of diﬀerent tumor types. standard compound doxorubicin is tested in each assay as a positive control. the cells
are maintained in growing condition in rpmi 1640

medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated
at 37 °c under 5% co2 atmosphere. all cell lines are
inoculated onto a series of standard 96-well microtiter
plate on day 0, followed by 24 h incubation in the absence of test compound. the inoculation densities used
in this screen are as per the procedure of monks
et al.15 all nces are dissolved in dmso and diluted
further in culture medium. an aliquot of each dilution
is added to the growing cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 48 h. after incubation, the assay is terminated
by adding 50 ll of trichloro acetic acid and incubating
at 4 °c for 30 min. the precipitated cells are washed and
stained with sulphorhodamine b dye for 30 min and the
excess dye is washed oﬀ with acetic acid. adsorbed dye
is solublized in  xxxd3449xxx  (alkaline ph) and quantitated
by measuring the od at 490 nm in an elisa reader.

extracts (100 lg total protein) prepared from cerebellum
of embryos (e11, e18, and 1-day-old) and whole brain,
cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and midbrain regions of the
young, adult, and old age groups were taken in eppendorf
tubes for immunoprecipitation and topo-ii a or b antibody (1:1000 dilution in immunoprecipitation buﬀer containing 100 mm tris–hcl, ph 8, 750 mm nacl, 2 mm
edta, 1 mm pmsf, and 0.75% nonidet) was added
to each sample. the antigen–antibody mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and 25 ll of 6% protein
an agarose beads was added. the beads were incubated at
4 °c for 15 min, spun down and the supernatant was removed. the protein an agarose beads were washed twice
with 0.5% triton x-100 in pbs. the beads were directly
used for monitoring the relaxation activity of topo-ii.17
