background: we describe a rare case of congenital hypothyroidism and an extremely high serum  xxxd3368xxx 
(tsh) level caused by a combination of resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) and a lingual thyroid. as the rth
mutant, r316c, was new, the optimum dose of levothyroxine was unclear. to aid in assessment of the therapy,
we characterized the mutant r316c thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  (tr) and compared it with a common mutant,
r316h, using in vitro studies.
summary: the patient was a newborn female having severe hypothyroidism with a free thyroxine level of
0.36 ng/dl and a serum tsh level of 177 mu/ml. a scintiscan showed ectopic lingual thyroid tissue without a
normal thyroid gland. supplementation with levothyroxine at a dose of >350 mg/day did not normalize the
serum tsh level; however, the patient showed normal growth and intelligence at 14 years of age. consistent
with the results of a computer analysis, the binding of r316c to triiodothyronine (t3) was significantly decreased to 38% that of the wild type. electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that like r316h, r316c
did not form a homodimer, but formed a heterodimer with rxr. however, a glutathione-s-transferase pulldown assay showed reduced binding of r316c with ncor in the absence of t3 and impaired release in the
presence of t3. in addition, transient transfection experiments demonstrated that unlike r316h, r316c had
severe impairment of transcriptional activity on genes both positively and negatively regulated by thyroid
hormone. it also had a clear dominant negative effect on genes negatively, but not positively, regulated by
thyroid hormone, including the tsh-releasing hormone and  xxxg2340xxx  genes.
conclusion: this is the first reported case of a r316c tr mutation. the characteristics of the r316c mutant
differed from those of the r316h mutant. our findings suggest that r316c causes reduced association with and
impaired release of ncor, resulting in rth predominantly at the pituitary level, and that slightly elevated
serum tsh level with high dose of levothyroxine might be optimum for normal growth.

introduction

t

he prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism is 1 in
3500 newborns, and 80% of cases are caused by thyroid
dysgenesis, most commonly due to ectopic lingual thyroid
tissue (1,2). the incidence of lingual thyroid is one in 100,000
newborns and the condition causes abnormalities in thyroid
development and dysplasia, which result in hypothyroidism
(3). it is important to initiate thyroid hormone replacement to
ensure normal growth and mental development, particularly

for children. generally, the serum  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) level is a
good marker for determining the optimum dose of levothyroxine (2,4).
resistance to thyroid hormone (rth) is a syndrome caused
by reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone (5–7). more that
2000 affected individuals belonging to about 500 families have
been identified, 85% of whom harbor mutations in the thyroid
 xxxg1603xxx  (tr) b gene ( xxxg2284xxx ) (5). to clarify a mutation of the trb gene, the number of the mutated amino acid
from the translation start cite flanked by the normal and

mutated amino acids is determined. rth is characterized by
an elevated serum thyroid hormone level that is associated
with an inappropriately high serum tsh. therefore, some
patients are misdiagnosed as having hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, if only the serum thyroid hormone levels or the
serum tsh levels, respectively, are considered alone. in most
patients, reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone in peripheral
organs is at least partially compensated for by elevated serum
thyroid hormone concentrations caused by elevated serum
tsh concentrations.
when primary hypothyroidism coexists with rth, the
evaluation of thyroid status is extremely difficult as is the optimum dose of thyroid hormone and optimum tsh level that
should be achieved. in fact, such patients are extremely rare.
here we describe the first patient with the rth mutant r316c.
this patient was even more unusual because she was born with
a lingual thyroid with severely reduced circulating thyroid
hormones at birth. we also characterized the thyroid hormone
binding characteristics and functional attributes of the r316c
mutant using conventional molecular methods including a
ligand-binding assay, a transient transfection analysis, the
glutathione-s-transferase (gst) pull-down assay, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) and compared these
characteristics with a common tr mutant, r316h.

patients and methods
case report
the patient was a japanese girl born at 39 weeks to healthy
parents. newborn screening at day 11 after birth revealed a
high serum tsh level (>100 mu/ml). she had symptoms of
hypothyroidism, including a low growth rate, abdominal
distention, mottled skin, open posterior fontanelle, prolonged
jaundice (total bilirubin, 16.4 mg/dl), and lethargy. on laboratory analysis, her serum tsh level was 177 mu/ml and
free thyroxine (ft4) level was 0.36 ng/dl (normal range: tsh,
0.5–5.5 mu/ml; ft4, 0.78–2.11 ng/dl). both parents had
normal thyroid function. a tsh-releasing hormone (trh)
stimulation test showed an exaggerated serum tsh response
(1979 mu/ml at 30 minutes). treatment with levothyroxine
lowered the serum tsh level; however, it could not be
maintained below 10 mu/ml.
at the age of 1 year and 4 months without levothyroxine
treatment, her serum tsh level was 345 mu/ml and ft4 level
was 0.16 ng/dl, indicating severe hypothyroidism. a scintiscan showed ectopic lingual thyroid tissue without a normal
thyroid gland (fig. 1a). we administered triiodothyronine
(t3) and a double dose of levothyroxine, but her serum tsh
level remained above normal. the detailed doses of le-

2.51 mu/ml, ft4 level was 3.2 ng/dl, total cholesterol level
was 156 mg/ml, and creatine phosphokinase (cpk) level was
166 iu/l. her bone age was 10.6 years, and her tanner breast
stage was 2–3. her iq was 103. her growth curve was normal
(fig. 1b), and she showed no signs of hypothyroidism.
genetic studies
with informed consent, genomic dna was extracted from
leukocytes of the patient and her parents. the study protocol
was approved by the ethics committees of the gunma university school of medicine. the entire coding exons of the
human trb gene were sequenced using an autosequencer
(prismtm 310; applied biosystems).
mammalian cell culture and transfection
cv-1 cells and hela cells were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, as described previously (8). twenty-four
hours before transfection, cells at subconfluence were split
into six-well plates. the transient transfection was performed using a calcium phosphate precipitation method, as
described previously (8). the total amount of transfected
plasmid was adjusted by adding an empty expression
vector in all experiments. sixteen hours after transfection,
the medium was changed to dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum treated

with  xxxg2361xxx -x8 resin (bio-rad) and activated charcoal (sigma)
to remove thyroid hormones. cells were further incubated
in the absence or presence of t3 (sigma).
plasmid construction
the mutant human trb1 cdnas (r316c, r316h, and
r320h) were prepared by pcr mutagenesis and were subcloned into the vector pkcr2. trh-luciferase (luc) contains
790 bp of the 50 flanking sequence and 54 bp of exon 1 from the
human trh gene in pa3-luc (trh-luc). the human tshbluc contains 1192 bp of the 50 flanking sequence and 37 bp of
exon 1 ( xxxg2340xxx -luc). as the promoter activity did not occur
with  xxxg2340xxx -luc alone, we co-transfected pit1 and  xxxg866xxx  for
sufficient  xxxg2340xxx  promoter activity (9). expression vectors for
human pit1 and mouse  xxxg866xxx  were prepared by pcr and
verified by sequencing the dna. the amplified cdna was
subcloned into the vector pcdna3.1 d/v5-his-topo.
binding experiments with t3
mutant and wild-type trs were transcribed and translated
using a tnt-coupled reticulolysate system (promega). affinity for t3 was determined using a filter-binding assay, as
reported previously (8). computer analysis of the binding of
t3 with the mutant tr and r316c mutants was done with
swiss-pdbviewer.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay
the emsa was performed using radiolabeled thyroid
hormone response element (tre)  xxxg1057xxx   xxxg2298xxx  or tre palindrome
fragments (8). the consensus sequences used as tre  xxxg1057xxx   xxxg2298xxx

stored at 808c. protein concentrations were determined by
the bradford method using the bio-rad protein assay reagent
(bio-rad laboratories, inc.). the lysate (30 mg) prepared
above was resolved by sds-page (10% gel) and transferred
to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (hybond-p; amersham biosciences) with a semidry system (bio craft) for
detecting the proteins. the blots were blocked for 1 hour with

transcriptional activity of the r316c mutant

it has been reported that a cluster of arginines (arg282,
arg316, and arg320) in trb electrostatically pair with the
ligand (t3)’s carboxylate. as shown in figure 3a, computer
analysis revealed that compared with that of the wild-type
receptor, the ligand-binding pocket of the mutant receptor
is enlarged by the change from arg to cys at residue 316.
the substitution also causes a reduction in the receptor’s
electrostatic potential: the mutant receptor should have less
electrostatic potential because the pka of cysteine (*10) is less
than that of arginine (*12).
we confirmed this result using synthetic tr and mutant
trs with tnt systems, and scatchard plot analysis of the
binding of t3 revealed that the affinity of r316c was 38%
(1.8103 m) that of the wild-type tr (3.1103 m), similar to
the affinity of r316h (1.8103 m). the r320h mutant
showed a slight reduction (62%) in affinity for t3 of the wild
type (fig. 3b).
emsa demonstrated that the ability of the r316c mutant to
form a heterodimer with rxr was similar to that of r316h,

to characterize the functional properties of the r316c
tr, we compared its ability to modulate the expression of
positively and negatively regulated reporter genes in cv1
cells with that of the wild-type tr and the tr mutants
r316h and r320h. in the first instance, we assayed the
ability of the mutant receptors to activate the transcription
of pal-tk-luc containing a palindoromic tre. as shown
in figure 4a, we found that although the wild-type tr activated pal-tk-luc in a dose-dependent manner, r316c
and r316h were significantly impaired in the ability to activate transcription. in contrast, r320h displayed only minor impairment.
we next examined the effect of the mutants on the repression of trh-luc and  xxxg2340xxx -luc expression by thyroid hormone. in trh-luc, the activation of the promoter in the
absence of t3 by r316c and r316h was *80% of the wildtype level and that by r320h was only 50% (fig. 4b). the
addition of t3 inhibited this activity in a dose-dependent
manner in the wild-type tr, with *90% repression at 100 nm

of t3. although r316h and r320h showed almost normal repression at 0.1–100 nm of t3, the r316c mutant
showed severe impairment of the suppression by thyroid
hormone, with a level of only 15%–20% that of wild-type tr
at 1–10 nm t3 in the trh gene (fig. 4b). in the  xxxg2340xxx  promoter, ligand-independent activation by r316c, r316h, and
r320h was similar to that by the wild-type tr. as in the
trh promoter, only r316c showed a significant impairment of the repression by thyroid hormone, with almost no

therefore, the impairment of the inhibition of the trh and

and autosomal dominant inheritance of rth, we investigated
the ability to inhibit wild-type receptor action in a dominant
negative manner. in these experiments, equal amounts of
wild-type and mutant receptors were coexpressed, and reporter gene activities were assayed at various hormone concentrations. as shown in figure 6a, none of the mutants
examined exerted a dominant effect on genes positively regulated by thyroid hormone (pal-tk-luc).
in contrast, r316c exerted a significant dominant negative
effect on the inhibition of the trh and  xxxg2340xxx  promoters by
thyroid hormone (fig. 6b, c). in both constructs, significant
ligand-independent stimulation was observed in the absence
of t3 (left panels). t3 at 100 nm caused a 50% and 90% reduction in the promoter activity of the trh and  xxxg2340xxx  genes
compared with the vehicle in the presence of wild-type tr.
however, the same amount of r316c caused only 25% and
60% inhibition, respectively (fig. 6b, right panels). therefore,
the dominant negative effect of the r316c mutant was greater
on the trh gene than  xxxg2340xxx  gene. however, r316h and
r320h exerted no dominant negative effect on the gene.

transfected with sirna (sincor1 and sicontrol), the
trh-luc reporter gene, and wild-type tr expression vectors. after incubation with 100 nm t3, promoter activity was
measured. in the vehicle with sicontrol rna, we observed significant ligand-independent activation of the trh
gene by tr and repression by t3. knockdown of ncor resulted in the absence of ligand-independent activation, but
did not affect repression by t3, which suggests that ncor
may act as a coactivator for the trh gene. data are presented as the mean  se for three experiments (**p < 0.01).

ncor. in contrast, in the absence of t3, the binding of r316c
with ncor was *70% of that of the wild-type tr, and addition of t3 resulted in no release of ncor. similarly, both
r316h and r320h bound with ncor at a level of *70% that
of the wild type; however, the addition of t3 resulted in a
significant release of ncor (fig. 5b).

as impairment of the association with ncor seemed to be
related to the ligand-independent activation of the trh gene
by trs, we examined the effect of the knocking down of
ncor on the trh gene activation by tr in the absence or
presence of t3. as shown in figure 7c, significant ligandindependent activation of tr was observed for the expression
of tr in hela cells, which have been reported to express
a significant amount of ncor, and addition of t3 induced
a significant reduction to below the basal level. transfection
of sirna for ncor led to a reduction of *70% in mrna and
62% in protein after 48 hours (fig. 7a, b). in this condition, the
ligand-independent activation of the trh gene by tr was
significantly reduced by 75%; however, no significant change
was observed for repression of the trh gene by t3. these
findings suggested that ncor may act as a coactivator for
the trh gene, at least in vitro.
discussion
here we describe a newly identified mutation, r316c, in a
rare case of rth associated with a lingual thyroid. r320h was
the first mutation of trb reported to be associated with rth
and a lingual thyroid (11). although in that case, the serum
tsh level at birth was high, 350 mu/ml, there were no
symptoms of hypothyroidism, the serum thyroid hormone
level was normal, and the patient was euthyroid and did not
require replacement therapy with levothyroxine in her first 5
years. that patient might have had a lingual thyroid with the
presence of orthotopic thyroid tissue, and it has been reported
that abnormalities due to r320h are minor and that some patients with r320h experience no symptoms (12–15). this may
explain why thyroid hormone replacement was not required to
maintain normal growth in the first 5 years. therefore, our
patient appears to be the first to have severe congenital hypothyroidism at birth with rth and a lingual thyroid.

r316c trb in a patient with rth and a lingual thyroid
further, a similar adult case in which a p453t mutant tr
was associated with hashimoto disease and hypothyroidism
has been reported, the serum tsh level being 140 mu/ml
with 0.34 ng/dl (normal, 0.75–1.75) serum ft4 (16). in this
case, replacement therapy with 100 mg/day of levothyroxine
improved the symptoms of hypothyridism, suggesting that
her hypothyroidism was not severe.
the optimum levels of serum thyroid hormone and tsh
for children with rth are not known, but may be inferred
from patients with the same mutation. as r316c is a novel
mutation, we first referred to cases of r316h. however,
r316h did not cosegregate with the rth phenotype in
family members described and some patients with r316h
showed a so-called pituitary rth phenotype, whereas other
showed a generalized rth phenotype (14,17–19). we
therefore characterized the r316c mutant in vitro to speculate on the phenotype of the individual with r316c. although r316c and r316h showed similar impaired binding
with t3, surprisingly, the characteristics of r316c differed
from those of r316h. unlike r316h, the repression of the
trh and tsh genes by thyroid hormone was severely impaired in r316c. r316h had no dominant negative effect on
genes positively or negatively regulated by thyroid hormone, as previously reported (20), whereas r316c exerted a
significant dominant effect on genes negatively, but not
positively, regulated by thyroid hormone.
the interaction of the mutant receptors with cofactors may
explain the functional difference between r316c and r316h.
both mutants were found to be defective in their ability to
homodimerize and showed a similar impairment of association
with a coactivator,  xxxg1510xxx . further, both mutants showed a
similar mild decrease in association with ncor. it has been
reported that ncor prefers to interact with the dna-bound
tr homodimer (21,22). therefore, the partial defects of the
r316c mutant in binding with ncor may be due to the impaired tr homodimerization. furthermore, r316h normally
released ncor in the presence of t3, but r316c did not.
the significance of the interaction of ncor to the ligandindependent stimulation of the genes negatively regulated by
thyroid hormone remains unclear. therefore, we conducted
an experiment to examine the effect of knocking down ncor
on the repression of the trh gene by thyroid hormone. reduced expression of ncor appeared to abolish the ligandindependent activation of the trh gene by tr in the absence
of t3, but not the repression of the gene by t3. these findings
suggested that ncor might act as a coactivator for the trh
gene.
further, our experiments in vitro showed the dominant
negative effect of the r316c mutant to be greater on the trh
gene than tsh gene. given these findings, the r316c mutant
had not only impaired t3 binding but also partially impaired
interactions with src and ncor. considering that ncor acts
as an activator for genes negatively regulated by thyroid
hormone, the combined effect of impaired t3 binding and
impaired release of ncor may have caused an increase in the
synthesis of trh and tsh in the hypothalamus and pituitary,
resulting in high serum tsh level in the patient.
in conclusion, we describe the first patient with rth due to
r316c trb mutation. the properties of r316c differ from the
previously reported r316h mutant. the patient is even more
unusual because of concomitant primary hypothyroidism
due to thyroid aplasia and lingual thyroid.
