planation cannot adequately account for the associations
between retinal vascular caliber and optic disc or rnfl
measurements. as such, other mechanisms may play a role.
for example, retinal vascular caliber may affect optic and
rnfl measurements through an effect on nutritional
support on these parameters, or retinal vessel caliber
simply may vary systematically and physiologically with
morphologic differences in the optic nerve head.

using  xxxd201xxx  in diagnosing
horner syndrome in children

the authors analyzed the data comparing the differences
in size of the smaller pupil compared with the larger pupil
for different light illuminations, with or without  xxxd201xxx  0.5%. we analyzed their data differently, looking at the differences in each pupil size in high levels of
illumination compared with low levels, before the instillation of  xxxd201xxx . the same analysis was applied to
pupils after the application of  xxxd201xxx , that is,
looking at the differences in pupil size in high compared to
low levels of illumination. we used the wilcoxon signedrank test to compare groups.
we found that, before instillation of  xxxd201xxx , the
mean difference in pupil size of the 10 patients in the
horner syndrome group between high and low illumination was 0.9 mm (standard deviation [sd], 0.5 mm)
compared with 1.7 mm (sd, 0.4 mm) in the physiologic
pupil group. this difference was statistically significant (p ⫽
.024). the mean difference between the groups between
high and low illumination when  xxxd201xxx  was used
was 1.7 mm (sd, 0.4 mm) and 1.3 mm (sd, 0.8 mm),
respectively. this difference was not statistically significant (p ⫽ .286). this demonstrates that simply comparing
the size of each pupil between high and low levels of
illumination is an effective method of diagnosing horner
syndrome without using any pharmacologic agents.
there have been recent reports of serious idiosyncratic
side effects of  xxxd201xxx , especially in children younger
than 6 months of age.2 side effects include excessive
drowsiness, bradycardia, hypertension, and decreased oxygen saturations. we believe that the small size of chen and
associates’ study, together with the absence of children
younger than 1 year of age, makes it difficult to conclude
that  xxxd201xxx  is safe to use to diagnose horner
syndrome.
we advise that, where there is diagnostic uncertainty,
the diagnosis of horner syndrome be made by comparing
the size of each pupil using differing light conditions (if
necessary, by the photographic method described by chen
and associates1) and the tried and tested safe method of
cocaine 4%.3

chen and associates reported on the efficacy and

safety of  xxxd201xxx  0.5% in diagnosing horner syndrome in children under high and low illumination.1 they
describe a prospective study comparing 10 patients with
horner syndrome (confirmed with positive cocaine 4% test
results) with 10 patients with physiologic anisocoria (with
negative cocaine 4% test results). the authors conclude
that in the horner syndrome group,  xxxd201xxx  0.5%
gives a reversal of anisocoria in all patients in light
conditions, but in only 7 patients in dim conditions.
therefore, they posit that it is effective as a diagnostic
method in diagnosing horner syndrome, especially in light
conditions. they also conclude that  xxxd201xxx  is a safe
drug to in to use in the diagnosis of horner syndrome in
children.
