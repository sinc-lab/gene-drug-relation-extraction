abstract
we report the relationship of gaba-transaminase inhibition in platelets and brain with the increase in brain g- xxxd2177xxx 
žgaba., as percents of the control, at 24 h after single and after 3 and 8 days of treatment with increasing doses ž1, 3, 10, 30, 100 and
300 mg kgy1 dayy1 . of vigabatrin in rats. the inhibition of gaba-transaminase in platelets correlated at least as well as that in brain
with the increase in brain gaba after 3 days ž r s y0.87 vs. r s y0.78., and 8 days of treatment ž r s y0.77 vs. r s y0.74., and when
the data of single and multiple doses were pooled ž r s y0.77 vs. r s y0.75.. the correlation between platelet gaba-transaminase and
brain gaba fitted to a power curve, the increase in brain gaba being significant only when platelet gaba-transaminase was inhibited
to less than 50% of the control. our results suggest that platelet gaba-transaminase could be a peripheral marker of the effect of
vigabatrin on brain gaba in rats. q 1999 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

another parameter that reflects them better.
gaba-transaminase has been identified in platelets
žwhite, 1979., and has enzymatic characteristics similar to
those of brain gaba-transaminase žwhite, 1979; white
and faison, 1980.. these enzymes are inhibited by vigabatrin in rats žbolton et al., 1989; valdizan

gaba-transaminase in brain and platelets has been described in rats after single doses but not after multiple
doses of vigabatrin žvaldizan

although the determination of platelet gaba-transaminase activity has been proposed as a way of controlling
treatment with gaba-transaminase inhibitors such as vigabatrin žwhite, 1979; rimmer et al., 1988., the relationship between the effects of vigabatrin on platelet gabatransaminase and brain gaba has not yet been investigated.
we have studied the effects of single and multiple
increasing doses of vigabatrin on brain gaba and the
relationship with gaba-transaminase inhibition in brain
and platelets in rats.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and groups

platelet extract and brain homogenate upper-phase concentrations of protein were determined by the method of
lowry et al. ž1951., using  xxxd100xxx  as a standard.
2.4. data analysis

the study was carried out in 21 groups of 10 adult male
wistar rats of similar age weighing between 450 and 500
g, housed at a temperature of 22 " 28c under natural
lightrdark conditions, and allowed food and water ad lib.
seven groups were treated with a single i.p. dose ž9 a.m..
of saline žcontrol group., or 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 mg
kgy1 of vigabatrin in aqueous solution. another seven
groups were treated for 3 days and the remaining seven
groups for 8 days with the same doses of vigabatrin once a
day.

statistical analysis was carried out using spssrpcq
software. differences between platelet and brain gabatransaminase activity in the same samples were analysed
by paired student’s t-test. comparison among the effects

2.2. samples
twenty four hours after the last vigabatrin dose, rats
were anaesthetised with ether, 10 ml of blood being collected from each rat by heart puncture and placed into
glass tubes containing 0.5 ml of 5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid žedta. to measure platelet gaba-transaminase activity. the whole brain was immediately removed, divided sagittally and weighed. one-half was homogenised in 5 ml of ice-cold water. homogenates were
then centrifuged at 2500 = g for 10 min at 48c to measure
brain gaba-transaminase activity in the supernatant. the
other half was homogenised in 5 ml of ice-cold methanol
and then centrifuged as described to measure gaba concentration in the supernatant. preparation of platelet extracts was performed according to the method of white
ž1979.. supernatant and platelet lysate samples were stored
at y208c until assay.
2.3. assays
platelet and brain gaba-transaminase activity was
measured by the radiometric method described by white
and faison ž1980. and modified as described by valdizan
´
and armijo ž1991.. mean gaba-transaminase activity in
control groups was 912 pmol miny1 mgy1 of protein in
brain, and 9.4 pmol miny1 mgy1 of protein in platelets.
quality control was assessed in five control samples assayed for 9 days in triplicate. within-assay and betweenassay coefficients of variation were 6.0 " 0.9 and 12.4 "
1.8%, respectively, for brain and 9.1 " 2.2 and 13.8 "
5.0%, respectively, for platelets.
brain gaba concentration was assayed by the liquid
chromatographic method of turnell and cooper ž1982.
modified as described by valdizan
´ and armijo ž1992..
mean brain gaba concentration in control groups was 2.1
mmol gy1 of tissue. within-assay and between-assay coefficients of variation in the five control samples were
2.3 " 0.9 and 6.8 " 3.4%, respectively.

of a single dose, 3 days and 8 days of treatment for each
individual vigabatrin dose was performed by one-way
analysis of variance. differences between series, for instance, between the effects of single and multiple doses
were assessed by analysis of covariance. correlation was
assessed in the samples in which all the gabaergic
parameters were available. it was estimated by linear,
exponential, logarithmic and power regression methods by
using the least-squares method. because the coefficients of
correlation were overall higher by power regression than
by linear, logarithmic or exponential regression, only power
coefficients of correlation are shown in the table. data are

was accepted throughout.

3. results
3.1. single õs. multiple doses of õigabatrin
platelet gaba-transaminase activity was reduced in a
dose-dependent manner by increasing single doses of vigabatrin. brain gaba-transaminase was progressively inhibited by single doses of vigabatrin higher than 30 mg kgy1 ,
this being accompanied by a progressive increase in brain
gaba concentration. the effects of vigabatrin on both
enzymes and gaba after 3 days and 8 days of treatment
were greater than after single doses žfig. 1.: the effects of
3 days of treatment were significantly greater than those of
single doses only for brain gaba-transaminase ž f s 7,

3.3. relationship between brain gaba increase and
gaba-transaminase inhibition
overall, the progressive inhibition of gaba-transaminase in brain and platelets achieved by increasing
doses of vigabatrin was accompanied by a progressive
increase in brain gaba levels. after single doses, the
mirror image with brain gaba was better for brain
gaba-transaminase than for the platelet enzyme žfig. 1,
top., and this was accompanied by a better power correlation in individual rats ž r s y0.72 and r s y0.57, respectively. žtable 1.. after 3 days and 8 days of treatment, the
mirror images with brain gaba were similar for the two
enzymes žfig. 1, middle and bottom., which were accompanied by a better correlation with the platelet enzyme
ž r s y0.78 for the brain and r s y0.87 for the platelet
enzyme after 3 days, and r s y0.74 vs. r s y0.77 after 8
days.. the correlation between the increase in brain gaba
and the inhibition of gaba-transaminase in individual
rats was also slightly better for the platelet enzyme when
data from single, 3 days and 8 days of treatment were
pooled žtable 1.. the data fitted better to a power curve
than to a straight line, but there were differences between
the two enzymes žfig. 2.. for platelet gaba-transaminase, the increase in brain gaba was significant only
when platelet gaba-transaminase activity was lower than
50% of the control. therefore, the difference between the
linear ž r s y0.63. and power ž r s y0.77. correlations
was large. a significant increase in brain gaba was
observed only when platelet gaba-transaminase activity
was inhibited from 50% to 0% of the control žfig. 2,
middle.. in contrast, the increase in brain gaba correlated almost linearly with the inhibition of brain gabatransaminase žfig. 2, bottom., the difference between the
linear ž r s y0.71. and power ž r s y0.75. correlations
being smaller.

4. discussion
the most interesting result in this study was the significant correlation between the increase in brain gaba and
the inhibition of platelet gaba-transaminase after multiple doses of vigabatrin. furthermore, we have found a
good correlation between the inhibition of gaba-transaminase in brain and in platelets after multiple doses of
vigabatrin.
the correlation between platelet and brain gaba-transaminase after single doses of vigabatrin has been described
previously žvaldizan
´ and armijo, 1991.. however, a correlation between the effects of vigabatrin on the two enzymes after multiple doses could not be demonstrated in
that study because platelet gaba-transaminase was totally
inhibited. this correlation has been demonstrated in the
present study in which lower doses of vigabatrin were
used.

the power correlation between platelet gaba-transaminase and brain gaba in individual rats was worse
than that observed with the brain enzyme after single doses
but it was slightly better after multiple doses. after single
doses, there was no increase in brain gaba or inhibition
of brain gaba-transaminase after 3, 10 or 30 mg kgy1 of
vigabatrin whereas platelet gaba-transaminase was progressively inhibited. however, after multiple days of treatment, the mirror image between the increase in brain
gaba and the inhibition of gaba-transaminase was
similar for the two enzymes, giving similar coefficients of
correlation with brain gaba in individual rats.
when data obtained after single doses, 3 days and 8
days of treatment were analysed together, similar coefficients of correlation were also found. it should be pointed
out that the relationship between the inhibition of platelet
gaba-transaminase activity and the increase in brain
gaba-concentration fitted to a power curve, and that a
significant increase in brain gaba was observed only
when platelet gaba-transaminase activity was inhibited
to less than 50% of the control group.
platelet gaba-transaminase activity could be used as a
peripheral marker of the effects of vigabatrin on gaba
concentrations in whole brain in rats. the increase in
whole brain gaba has been related to the anticonvulsant
effects of vigabatrin in some models of epilepsy in rodents
žbernasconi et al., 1988; gale, 1989; schechter et al.,
1977.. therefore, it is possible that the inhibition of platelet
gaba-transaminase could also reflect the anticonvulsant
effects of vigabatrin. we did not analyse plasma concentrations of vigabatrin because they are almost undetectable at
24 h, nor was the anticonvulsant effect of vigabatrin
assessed in this study. more specific studies are needed to
determine if platelet gaba-transaminase reflects the anticonvulsant effects of vigabatrin better or worse than brain
gaba, brain gaba-transaminase, vigabatrin plasma concentrations or other peripheral markers.
data on the effects of vigabatrin on platelet gabatransaminase in epileptic patients are scarce žbolton et al.,
1989; arteaga et al., 1992.. in the study of arteaga et al.
ž1992., a relationship between the degree of inhibition of
platelet gaba-transaminase and seizure reduction was
observed in some vigabatrin respondent children in whom
the vigabatrin dose was gradually increased, but a correlation between the two parameters could not be demonstrated žarteaga et al., 1992.. this lack of correlation may
be attributed to the fact that platelet gaba-transaminase
activity was maximally inhibited by the vigabatrin dose
used in the study. in fact, platelet gaba-transaminase
activity, after a mean dose of 57 mg kgy1 of vigabatrin,
did not decrease when the dose was increased to 84 mg
kgy1 žarteaga et al., 1992.. however, the possibility of a
relationship between the inhibition of platelet gabatransaminase and the antiepileptic effects of vigabatrin at
doses that do not totally inhibit platelet gaba-transaminase was not discarded.

´ et al.r european journal of pharmacology 369 (1999) 169–173

other peripheral markers such as gaba or glutamate
in csf and gaba in plasma have also been proposed for
monitoring the effects of vigabatrin. in fact, vigabatrin
respondent patients had a higher csf increase in total
gaba žriekkinen et al., 1989., a higher baseline csf
glutamate žkalviainen
et al., 1993., and a higher increase
¨ ¨
in plasma gaba žloscher
et al., 1993. as compared with
¨
both controls and non-responders. however, the increase
in csf gaba during vigabatrin add-on treatment in mentally retarded patients was similar in patients with both
good and poor responses žpitkanen
et al., 1988..
¨
in summary, our results demonstrate a significant power
correlation between the inhibition of gaba-transaminase
in platelets and the increase in gaba concentration in
brain at 24 h after single and multiple increasing doses of
vigabatrin in rats, the correlation with platelet gabatransaminase being at least as good as that with the brain
enzyme after multiple doses. these results suggest that
platelet gaba-transaminase could be used as a peripheral
marker of the effects of this antiepileptic drug on brain
gaba in rats especially at doses which inhibit platelet
gaba-transaminase activity to less than 50% of the control group but do not totally inhibit the activity of this
enzyme.
