abstract
terfenadine (tf) is a highly potent  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist that in clinically effective doses is free
of significant central nervous system side effects. ketoconazole (kt) is a worldwide used oral antifungal agent with a broad
spectrum of activity against both superficial and systemic mycosis. simultaneously administration of kt and tf has been
reported to induce several potent symptoms including cardiotoxicity, excitotoxicity, inhibition of blood mononuclear
cells proliferation, and cardiovascular toxicity. however, the intracellular molecular mechanisms of tf–kt interactions
in cells were still uncertain. in this study, we first demonstrated that tf (5–30 mm) induced apoptosis in several types of
human cancer cell lines including human hepatoma (hep g2), colorectal cancer (colo 205), and fibroblast (ccd
922sk) cells for 24 h. the cellular responses to tf-induced apoptosis were demonstrated to be associated with the
p53-signaling pathway, including induction of p53, p21/ xxxg418xxx , p27/ xxxg419xxx , bax protein expression and inhibition of
bcl-2 protein expression. to realized the role of  xxxg1078xxx  involved in tf-induced apoptosis, different  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists including promethazine,  xxxd2572xxx , and chlorpheniramin (50–100 mm) were administered and
demonstrated that these chemicals cannot induced apoptosis through the  xxxg1078xxx  signaling pathway. interestingly, we
found that the apoptotic effect of tf (2.5 mm) was significantly potentiated by kt (1 mm) treatment in hep g2 cells through
inhibition of the  xxxg590xxx  (cyp 3a4) activity. such results were demonstrated by decreased of the tf activity
with recombinant cyp 3a4, which prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells.our results provide the molecular
basis of tf–kt interaction and this information should allow more rational forecasting of the risk for tf therapy during coadministration of kt. j. cell. biochem. 87: 147–159, 2002. ß 2002 wiley-liss, inc.

heart [liu et al., 1997; lu and wang, 1999]. the
mechanisms were demonstrated by block
sodium current [lu and wang, 1999] and ltype ca2þ channel current [liu et al., 1997] in
myocytes isolated from experimental animal.
other studies demonstrated that tf potentiated
the excitotoxic response to n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptor agonists in cerebellar neurons
[diaz-trelles et al., 1999, 2000]. in addition,
antigen/mitogen-induced peripheral bloodmononuclear cells proliferation was inhibited by tf in
a concentration-dependent manner [holen et al.,
1995]. the metabolisms of the tf to its desalkyl
and hydroxy metabolites were demonstrated to
be mediated by human liver microsomal enzymes cytochrome p450-3a (cyp 3a4) isoforms
[ling et al., 1995; rodrigues et al., 1995]. the
testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation has been
shown to be the principal enzyme involved in
the first step in tf’s biotransformation (formation of azacyclonol and tf alcohol) [ling et al.,
1995].
ketoconazole (kt) is an azole antifungal
agent with a broad spectrum of activity against
both superficial and systemic mycosis [bisschop
et al., 1979]. the target enzyme of the kt were
identified as the fungal lanosterol demethylase
which contains cytochrome p450 as a coenzyme [gupta et al., 1986]. as described above, the
metabolism of tf was through cyp 3a4 [ling
et al., 1995; rodrigues et al., 1995], whereas
the kt is a potent and selective inhibitor of
this enzyme [boxenbaum, 1999a; parker et al.,
2000]. several studies demonstrated that clinical adverse interactions of tf with azole antifungals agent (kt) may be related to inhibition
of tf biotransformation [jurima-romet et al.,
1994; rodrigues et al., 1995; hey et al., 1996a].
simultaneously administration of kt and tf
may predict a large and potentially hazardous
impairment of tf clearance by kt [haaz et al.,
1998; baune et al., 1999; boxenbaum, 1999b;
herman et al., 1999]. in addition, kt is now
been demonstrated as a potent inhibitor of
cytochrome p450(17) alpha (17alpha-hydroxylase/c(17,20)-lyase), which is required for
androgen synthesis and is applicable in treatment of some types of prostate cancer [nnane
et al., 1998; grigoryev et al., 1999]. trachtenberg et al. [trachtenberg and pont, 1984] and
williams et al. [williams, 1984] first reported
that the kt has antitumor activity in prostate
cancer and suggested a direct cytotoxic effect on
androgen-independent prostate cancer. recent-

ly, our studies demonstrated that apoptosis and
g0/g1 phase of cell cycle arrest were induced by
kt in different types of human cancer cell lines
through the p53-signaling pathway [ho et al.,
1998; chen et al., 2000]. our results provide the
direct evidences indicated that some additional
mechanisms (such as apoptosis induction and
cell growth inhibition) affect by kt might be
applied in some other types of cancer chemotherapy.
apoptosis is an active and gene-directed form
of cell death with well characterized morphological and biochemical features [king and
cidlowski, 1995]. in this study, we first demonstrated that apoptosis was easily induced in
human cancer cell lines by tf. our data revealed that such apoptosis-inducing effects by tf
were not correlated with the h1-receptor signaling pathway. we found that tf-induced
apoptosis was significantly potentiated by kt
in human hep g2 cells through inhibition of
cyp 3a4 activity. the specific aims of this study
were to investigate the molecular events of apoptosis in cells induced by tf. the kt-inhibited
cyp3a4 in hep g2 cells in the potentiation of
tf-induced apoptosis was also demonstrated.
our results provide more direct evidences of the
toxic effects in clinical patients during coadministration of kt and tf.
materials and methods
chemicals
tf, kt, chlorpheniramine, and promethazine were purchased from sigma chemical co.
(st. louis, mo). the  xxxd2572xxx  was purchased from asahi chemical industry (tokyo,
japan). the protein assay kit was purchased
from bio-rad co. (bio-rad labs., hercules, ca).
cell lines and cell culture
the cell line ht 29 (htb-38; american type
culture collection, rockville, md) was isolated
from a moderately well-differentiated grade ii
human colon adenocarcinoma [semple et al.,
1978]. hl 60 cells was developed from human
myeloid leukemia cells. the cell line colo 205
(ccl-222; american type culture collection)
was developed from a poorly differentiated
human colon adenocarcinoma. hep 3b cells
(hb 8064; american type culture collection)
were derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma line. [knowles et al., 1980; darlington
et al., 1987] the cell line hep g2 (hb 8065;

ketoconazole potentiated terfenadine-induced apoptosis in hep g2 cells
american type culture collection) was derived
from a human hepatocellular carcinoma,
[knowles et al., 1980; darlington et al., 1987]
and contains wild-type p53. [bressac et al.,
1990] the cell line ccd-922sk (crl 1828;
american type culture collection) was derived
from normal human fibroblasts. the cell line
#76 khgh (crl 8858; atcc) was composed
of keratinocytes derived from normal human
epidermis. the p53 gene in the colo 205 and
ccd-922sk cells was cloned into the ta cloning
vector (invitrogen, san diego, ca) and sequenced. the p53 gene in colo 205 and ccd-922sk
cells was of the wild-type [ho et al., 1996]. in
ht-29 cells, p53 is mutated in codon 273.
[niewolik et al., 1995] the p53 gene has been
found to be partially deleted (7 kb) in hep 3b
cells [darlington et al., 1987]. cell lines were
grown at 378c in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere in eagle’s minimal essential medium
(for hep 3b, hep g2, and ccd-922sk cells),
rpmi 1640 (for hl 60, colo 205, and ht29 cells) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(fcs), 50 mg/ml  xxxd2193xxx , and 0.3 mg/ml
glutamine. a 3:1 mixture of ham’s f12 medium
and dmem medium (for #76 khgh cells)
supplemented with 10% fcs, 40 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 0.01 mg/ml cholera toxin, 0.005 mg/ml
insulin, and 10 ng/ml  xxxg681xxx 
[ho et al., 2001].
chemical exposure and determination
of cell viability
for the toxicity studies, stock solutions
(50 mm) of each drug were prepared by dissolving the compounds in dimethylsulfoxide
(dmso). then the stock solutions of drugs were
diluted with serum-free and antibiotics-free
medium to yield final concentrations ranging
from 0 to 15 mm. the final treatment concentration of dmso was 0.05% (v/v) dmso/culture
medium. after various periods of incubation,
cells were sedimented and the viability of the
cells was determined immediately by the trypan
blue exclusion assay. the viability percentage
was calculated based on the percentage of
unstained cells.
analysis of dna fragmentation
treated or mock-treated cells were grown in
9-cm petri dishes. both attached and detached
cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold
pbs, and the dna was then isolated as described in our previous study [ho et al., 1998].

149

samples were electrophoresed in a 1.5% (w/v)
agarose gel and dna was visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
preparation of protein lysate,
sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page),
and immunoblotting
the protein preparation has been described
previously [ho et al., 1998; chen et al., 2000].
treated or untreated subconfluent monolayers
of cells in 9-cm petri dishes were rinsed three
times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs), scraped off with a rubber policeman,
pelted at 800g for 5 min and lysed in 500 ml of
freshly prepared extraction buffer (10 mm trishcl, ph 7; 140 mm  xxxd3213xxx ; 3 mm
 xxxd2532xxx ; 0.5% (v/v) np-40; 2 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1% (w/v) aprotinin; 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min on ice. the
extracts were cleared by centrifugation for
30 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000g.
equal amounts of proteins (50 mg) (estimated
using bio-rad protein assay kit, bio-rad labs.)
were separated by 12.5% (w/v) sds–page on
0.75 mm mini-gels (migdet system; pharmacia,
inc., piscataway, nj) and were transferred to
an immobilon p membrane (millipore corp.,
bedford, ma) with a semidry electroblotting
apparatus (te70; hoefer scientific instruments, san francisco, ca) at 2 ma/cm2 for
40 min in 25 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3; 192 mm
glycine; and 20% (v/v) methanol. the membrane
was blocked overnight at room temperature
with blocking reagent (20 mm tris, ph 7.4;
125 mm nacl; 0.2% (v/v) tween 20; 4% (w/v)
non-fat dry milk; and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide).
antibodies and immunoblot analysis
antibodies used for immunoblot assays
included the polyclonal rabbit antisera (used
at 0.1%, v/v) specific for human bax protein
(ab-1, can bioscience co., ca) were raised
against synthetic peptide corresponding to
amino acids 150–165 of human bax protein.
mouse monoclonal antibodies include p53, p21/
 xxxg418xxx , p27/ xxxg419xxx  (transduction laboratories,
lexington, ky), parp, bad, bcl-2, caspase-3,
and pcna (santa cruz, inc., ca). sds–page
and electroblotting to nitrocellulose filters were
performed as described above. filters were
incubated for 1 h with primary antibody,
washed three times, and then incubated with
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary
antibody (immunoglobulin g) in pbs and 0.5%

(v/v) tween 20 for another 45 min with gentle
shaking. after three final washes, the proteins
were visualized by incubating with the colorigenic substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (sigma
chemical co.).
metabolism of tf by recombinant
human cyp 3a4
microsomes prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells expressing cyp 3a4 were obtained from genetest (woburn, ma) [nakajima
et al., 1999]. the recombinant cyp 3a4 was
coexpressed with cytochrome b5 [kobayashi
et al., 2000]. control microsomes were from
insect cells infected with wild-type baculovirus.
microsomes from insect cells containing recombinant cyp 3a4 (50 pmol/ml) were incubated
with tf (2.5 mm) at 378c for 30 min. in this
study, kt and itraconazole (itra) were used as
a selective cyp 3a4 inhibitor as described in the

previous study [jurima-romet et al., 1994;
baldwin et al., 1995; newton et al., 1995].
results
tf-induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines
in the figure 1a, human hepatocellular
carcinoma (hep g2), colon cancer (colo 205),
normal human fibroblast (ccd 922sk), and
normal human keratinocyte (#76 khgh) cells
were treated with various concentrations (5–
15 mm) of tf and the viability of these cells were
determined in a time dependent manner. as
seen in figure 1a,b, the viability of the hep g2
and colo 205 cells was less than 30% at 24 h
after exposure to tf (15 mm). no significant
cytotoxicity was observed in control fibroblast
(ccd-922sk) and keratinocyte (#76 khgh)
cells treated with dmso (0.05%, v/v). our results indicated that human cancer cells including hep g2 and colo 205 were more sensitive

to investigate whether the cytotoxic effects of
tf observed in human cancer cells were due to
the presence of apoptotic cell death. cells were
treated with tf (5–30 mm) for 24 h and dna
fragmentation analysis were performed. as
shown in figure 2a,b, significant dna ladders
were observed in both of the hep g2 and colo
205 cells after 10 mm of tf treatment for 24 h.
our results indicated that such apoptoticinduction effect of tf was not cell-type specific.
we further demonstrated that normal human
fibroblast (ccd 922sk) cells were more resistant to tf treatment when compared to cancer
cells (fig. 2c).

dmso (0.05%) as a negative control.

elevation of the p53 protein in tf-treated
hep g2 and colo 205 cells
the tumor suppressor, p53, has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes [greenblatt
et al., 1994; bates and vousden, 1996]. however,
the undisputed roles of p53 are the inducing of
cell growth arrest and apoptosis [el-deiry et al.,
1994]. to further investigate the role of p53
involved in tf-induced apoptosis, human colo
205, and hep g2 cells with wild type p53 status
were treated with tf (1–15 mm) for 24 h and
the levels of cell cycle and apoptosis-regulated
proteins expression were determined (fig. 3).
as shown in the figure 3, the amount of p53,
p21/ xxxg418xxx , and p27/ xxxg419xxx  in both cells was
increased with increasing doses of tf up to
15 mm. in addition, significant induction of bax
and inhibition of bcl-2 were observed in both
cells exposed to tf (fig. 3). the activated
caspase-3 protein was detected in both cells
during 24 h of tf (>10 mm) treatment. according to the previous report [tewari et al., 1995],
the substrate of caspase-3 is poly-adp ribose
polymerase (parp). western blotting analysis
revealed that the parp (116 kda) molecule was
degraded to a relatively stable (85 kda) fragment at 24 h after tf (>10 mm) treatment
(fig. 3). the bad protein expression were also

panel) and colo 205 (right panel) cells were treated with tf (1–

and normalized to 50 mg/lane. each blot is representative of at
least three different experiments.

whiles the pcna expressionwas not changed.
histamine h1-receptor antagonist cannot
induce human cancer cells apoptosis
as described above, tf is a specific histamine
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonist [rafferty and holgate,
1987]. to further scrutinize whether antihistamine that against  xxxg1078xxx  could induce
apoptosis in human cancer cells, three additional
clinical used antihistamine specific against h1
receptor namely promethazine [nakamura et al.,
1996],  xxxd2572xxx  [nakamura et al., 1998], and
chlorpheniramine [yasuda et al., 1995] were
used for determination of their apoptosis induction effects. as shown in the figure 4a, all these
types of antihistamine were added to the hep g2
cells in a high concentration of 50–100 mm for
24 h exposure. our results demonstrated that
any types of cells death including apoptosis
(fig. 4a, lanes 2–7) and necrosis (fig. 4b,
lanes 2–7) were not observed in hep g2 cells
even in high concentration (100 mm) of h1
receptor antagonist treatment. however, dna
laddering was observed in lower dose (20 mm)
of tf-treated hep g2 cells. such results implied that tf-induced apoptosis in hep g2 cells
might not be through the h1-receptor signaling
pathway.
kt potentiate the tf-induced apoptosis
effects in the hep g2 cells
the metabolic reactions of tf are presumed to
be mediated by cytochrome p450-3a isoforms.
the azole antifungal agent kt was a highly
potent inhibitor, having mean inhibition constants (ki) of 0.037 and 0.34 mm for desalkyland hydroxy-terfenadine formation, respectively.
the itra also was a potent inhibitor, with ki
values of 0.28 and 2.05 mm, respectively. [von
moltke et al., 1996]. recently, several studies
demonstrated that clinical adverse interactions
of tf with azole antifungals agents (kt and
itra) may be related to inhibition of tf biotransformation [jurima-romet et al., 1994;
rodrigues et al., 1995; hey et al., 1996a]. to
realize whether the drug-induced cellular apoptotic effects were involved in the clinical observed tf–kt and tf–itra interactions, the
minimal concentrations of tf, itra, and kt
that required for induction of apoptosis during
combine treatment of both agents in hep g2
cells were measured. the drug-induced apoptotic cells (appeared in the sub g1 phase) were

in the lane 1 were treated with 20 mm of tf for 24 h as a positive
control. a: the dna were isolated from these cells and detected

detected by flow cytometry analysis. interestingly, our results revealed that 1 mm of kt and
itra were the minimal concentration that
required for induction of significant apoptosis
in the hep g2 cells when treated with tf
(2.5 mm) simultaneously (fig. 5a,b). accordingly, our data further demonstrated that the
minimal concentration of tf required for induction of apoptosis in the presence of kt (1 mm)
and itra (1 mm) were measured as 1 mm

205 and ht 29) cells were selected. our data
revealed that apoptosis induction by combine
treatment of tf (2.5 mm) and kt (1 mm) were
more profound in hepatocellular carcinoma
(hep g2 and hep 3b) cells when compared to
the colon cancer (colo 205 and ht 29) cells
(fig. 6). the apoptotic cells were significantly
observed by 1 mm of kt treatment in hl 60 cells
(fig. 6e; bar 4). however, no significant potentiation of the apoptotic effects were observed in
the hl 60 cells when combine treatment with
tf (2.5 mm) and kt (1 mm) (fig. 6e; bar 5).
tf induced apoptosis was potentiated by
kt through inhibition of intracellular

itra, and tf that required for apoptosis induction in combine

treated with (a) tf (2.5 mm) plus kt (0.1–1 mm), (b) tf (2.5 mm)
plus itra (0.1–1 mm), and (c) tf (1–10 mm) simultaneously with
either kt (1 mm) or itra (1mm) for 24 h. facs analysis of dna
content was conducted when hep g2 cells were harvested after
drug treatment. percentage of cells in the sub g1 phase of the cell
cycle was determined using established cellfit dna analysis
software. three samples were analyzed in each group, and
values represent the mean value.

(fig. 5c). such results implied that the cyp 3a4
might be play an important role in the tfinduced apoptosis in our system.
to further investigate whether these observations were cell-type specific, additional four
types of human cancer cell lines including
human hepatocellular carcinoma (hep 3b),
leukemia (hl 60), and colon cancer (colo

previous studies demonstrated thatbiotransformation of the tf to its desalkyl and hydroxy
metabolites were presumed to be mediated by
human liver microsomal enzymes cyp 3a isoforms [ling et al., 1995; rodrigues et al., 1995].
the cyp 3a4 enzyme in the hep g2 cells was
significant inhibited by kt (1.0 mm), which is a
potent and selective inhibitor [boxenbaum,
1999a; parker et al., 2000]. substantially inhibited metabolism of tf by kt may lead to profound increases of tf exposure [haaz et al.,
1998; baune et al., 1999; boxenbaum, 1999b;
herman et al., 1999]. the apoptotic effects of tf
in hep g2 cells were first demonstrated in this
study. accordingly, to further clarify the roles of
cyp 3a4 involved in tf-induced apoptosis, the
hep g2 cells were treated with tf (2.5 mm), kt
(1 mm) or combine treatment of both agents for
24 h and the dna fragmentation was then
analyzed (fig. 7a). as shown in the figure 7a
(lanes 2, 3), dna fragmentation was not observed in the hep g2 cells treated either with
kt (1 mm) or tf (2.5 mm) alone. however, dna
fragmentation was only observed significantly
in hep g2 cells by combined treated with both
agents (fig. 7a, lane 6). our results also
demonstrated that the p53, p21/ xxxg418xxx , and p27/
 xxxg419xxx  proteins expressions were significantly
enhanced by combine treatment of kt (1 mm)
plus tf (2.5 mm) when compare to tf- or kttreated alone (fig. 7b). our results shown in
the figure 7a,b clearly demonstrated that kt
(1 mm) potentiated the tf (2.5 mm)-induced
dna laddering effects in the hep g2 cells
and such apoptosis effects might be induced
through the p53, p21/ xxxg418xxx , and p27/ xxxg419xxx  proteins activation.

conducted when cells were harvested after drug treatment.
percentage of cells in the sub g1, g0/g1, s, and g2/m phases of
the cell cycle were determined using established cellfit dna
analysis software. three samples were analyzed in each group,
and values represent the mean value.

to further investigate whether the ktpotentiated dna laddering effect that induced
by tf was due to inhibition of cyp 3a4 activity
in hep g2 cells. microsomes from baculovirusinfected insect cells expressing cyp 3a4 were
prepared to examine the inhibitory effects of
cyp 3a4 involved in metabolism of tf. the tf
(2.5 mm) was preincubated with the recombinant cyp 3a4 (30 pmol of cyp/ml) at 378c for
30 min [kobayashi et al., 2000]. the cyp 3a4treated tf (2.5 mm) was then added to the hep
g2 cells for dna laddering analysis (fig. 7a,
lane 4). our results demonstrated that dna
laddering effects were completely attenuated in

hep g2 cells when combine treatment of kt
(1 mm) and cyp 3a4-inactivated tf (2.5 mm)
(fig. 7a, lane 5). such results further implied
that kt-inhibited cyp 3a4 activity may increase the concentrations of tf present in the
cultured medium.

in this study, hep g2 and colo 205 cells
(with wild type p53) were very sensitive to tf.

ketoconazole potentiated terfenadine-induced apoptosis in hep g2 cells

155

fig. 7. tf-induced dna fragmentation was potentiated by kt
through induction of p53, p21/ xxxg418xxx , and p27/ xxxg419xxx . a: hep g2
cells were treated with tf, kt, or both for 24 h in the following
treatments: (lane 1) dmso (0.05%), (lane 2) kt (1 mm), (lane 3)
tf (2.5 mm), (lane 4) tf (2.5 mm) pre-incubated with microsomes
prepared from insect cells (containing recombinant cyp 3a4) for
30 min, the mixtures were then added to cells, (lane 5) tf (2.5 mm)
was pre-incubated with microsomes prepared from insect cells
(containing recombinant cyp 3a4) for 30 min, kt (1 mm) was
added to these mixtures then treated for hep g2 cells

immediately for additional 24 h, or (lane 6) combine treated
with both tf (2.5 mm) and kt (1 mm). the dna was isolated and
analyzed for dna laddering effects from these cells treated with
drugs 24 h later. b: hep g2 cells were treated with tf, kt, or both
for 24 h in the following treatments: (lane 1) dmso (0.05%),
(lane 2) tf (2.5 mm), (lane 3) kt (1 mm), or (lane 4) combine
treated with both tf (2.5 mm) and kt (1 mm). the p53, p21/ xxxg418xxx ,
and p27/ xxxg419xxx  proteins expression were analyzed by western
blotting analysis from these cells treated with drugs.

the p53 protein expression was significantly
induced in both cells as evidenced by immunoblotting analysis. according to the previous
reports described, p53 inhibits expression of
bcl-2 and induces expression of bax [miyashita
et al., 1994; miyashita and reed, 1995]. in our
recent study [jiang et al., 1996], apoptosis was
induced by various stimuli (such as  xxxd3241xxx , quinacrine, and cycloheximide) in hep g2
cells. most of these stimuli induced both p53 and
myc protein expression. however, none of the
stimuli altered the expression levels of the bcl-2
and bax protein. on the other hand, others’ and
ours studies demonstrated that agents which
cause dna damage (such as no and g-radiation) might elevate p53 and bax levels, inhibit
bcl-2 expression and eventually cause apoptosis
[ho et al., 1996, 1997, 1999a,b; kitada et al.,
1996]. such results implied that the p53regulated bax and bcl-2 protein expression was
not changed by all of the apoptotic inducing

agents. in this study, the bcl-2 and bax protein
expression were significantly changed by tf
treatment in hep g2 and colo 205 cells. the
direct evidence of p53-regulated tf-induced
bcl-2 and bax protein expression will be investigated in our further study by p53-specific
antisense oligonucleotide as described recently
[chen et al., 2000]. on the other hand, we
demonstrated that the hep 3b cells (with deleted p53) were also exhibited a significant sensitivity to tf-induced apoptosis. such results
implied that the p53-signaling pathway was the
one but not the only one way to induce apoptosis
by tf.
kt affects the normal functions of liver and
intestine through inhibition of microsomal
cyp enzymes
kt is a worldwide used antifungal agent with
a broad spectrum of activity against both
systemic and superficial mycosis. however, its

156

wang et al.

use was associated with adverse reactions and
the most common side effects are hepatotoxicity
[lewis et al., 1984; lake-bakaar et al., 1987;
benson et al., 1988]. many reports demonstrated that kt interfere the biotransformation
of many hazardous compounds and the drug–
drug interactions with kt in man are due to the
effects of this drug on hepatic microsomal activity [fleishaker et al., 1996; floren et al., 1997;
khoo et al., 1998]. recently, advanced studies
demonstrated that hepatic microsomal enzyme
cyp 3a4 was selectively inhibited by kt in vitro
and in vivo [boxenbaum, 1999a,b; gibbs et al.,
2000]. the roles of cyp 3a isoforms are responsible for the metabolism of a majority of
therapeutic compounds [meredith et al., 1985;
mosca et al., 1985], and they are abundant in the
intestine and liver [tsunoda et al., 1999]. kt
has also been reported for  xxxg575xxx  inhibition in
the intestine in some individuals [paine et al.,
1999]. all these results revealed that the hepatotoxicity and intestinal toxicity induced by kt
may be due to inhibition of microsomal enzymes
in human tissues.
inhibition of cyp 3a4 activity in an effective
concentration of kt cannot induced apoptosis
in human cancer cells
the cyp 3a4 enzyme in cultured hep g2 cells
was nearly complete inhibited by kt in a concentration of 1 mm [boxenbaum, 1999a; parker
et al., 2000]. however, in such a concentration of
kt (1 mm) cannot induce apoptosis in hep g2
cells (fig. 6c). our previous studies demonstrated that apoptosis and g0/g1 cell cycle
arrest were induced by kt in a concentrations
of more than 5 mm in different types of human
cancer cells including human hepatocellular
carcinoma (hep g2 and hep 3b), and colorectal
cancer (colo 205 and ht 29) cells [ho et al.,
1998; chen et al., 2000]. cyp 3a4 was reported
involved in the biotransformation of tf [ling
et al., 1995; rodrigues et al., 1995], whereas the
tf does not have the same inhibitory potential
for cytochrome p-450 isozymes as kt [back
et al., 1989]. another study demonstrated
that kt strongly inhibited n-desmethyladinazolam demethylation (ic 50 ¼ 0.14 mm) studied
with human liver microsomes using substrate
concentration in a range of 10–1,000 mm
[venkatakrishnan et al., 1998].the inhibition
constants (ki) of kt for the desalkyl and
hydroxy pathway of tf metabolism were averaged of 0.024 and 0.237 mm, respectively [von

moltke et al., 1994]. these results indicated that
1.0 mm of kt could inhibit the intracellular cyp
3a4 activity in a significant level. however, our
results demonstrated that inhibition of cyp
3a4 enzyme activity by kt in an effective
concentration (1.0 mm) was not induced apoptosis in human hep g2 cells (figs. 6c and 7a). our
results revealed that kt-induced apoptosis was
only observed in a concentration of more than
5 mm (fig. 2a) and the apoptosis signaling
pathway has been demonstrated to be associated with the p53-signaling pathway in our
recent study [ho et al., 1998; chen et al., 2000].
inhibition of cyp 3a4 decreased the
biotransformation of tf and increased exposure
of tf in cultured hep g2 cells
as shown in the figure 6, combine treatment
of kt (1.0 mm) with tf (2.5 mm) significantly
induced apoptosis in hep g2 cells. however,
this apoptotic effect induced by tf was completely attenuated when tf was pretreated
with recombinant cyp 3a4. our data suggested
that inhibition of intracellular cyp 3a4 by kt
in hep g2 cells decreased the biotransformation of tf in cultured medium, such results
may eventually increased and prolonged the tf
exposure. a previous study used a mathematical model, based on the in vitro ki values and the
usual clinical range of plasma kt concentrations (1–5 mg/ml; 1.88–0.94 mm), predicted that
plasma tf levels during coadministration of kt
would increase by a factor ranging from 13- to
59-fold relative to the same dose of tf given
without kt. actual plasma tf levels during
tf–kt coadministration in a clinical pharmacokinetic study were close to those predicted
by the model [von moltke et al., 1994]. these
plasma levels were associated with prolongation
of the corrected qt interval, thereby explaining the potentially life-threatening ventricular
arrhythmias reportedly associated with tf–kt
cotherapy [von moltke et al., 1996].
implications of the drug–drug interaction
of kt and tf in clinical therapeutic purpose
tf was reported by brandon et al. (1980),
appears to be the first antihistamine do not
block cholinergic or central h1 receptors and
thus do not produce the side effects, such as
sedation, impaired psychomotor performance,
and excessive mucosal drying [brandon and
weiner, 1980]. recently, the adverse effects of
tf were illustrated in several studies including

ketoconazole potentiated terfenadine-induced apoptosis in hep g2 cells
cardiotoxic and excitotoxic responses [liu et al.,
1997; diaz-trelles et al., 1999; lu and wang,
1999]. several additional studies demonstrated
that clinical adverse interactions of tf with
azole antifungals agent (kt) may be related to
inhibition of tf biotransformation [jurimaromet et al., 1994; rodrigues et al., 1995; hey
et al., 1996a]. the mechanisms were now been
investigated that simultaneously administration of kt and tf may predicted a potentially
hazardous impairment of tf clearance by kt
[haaz et al., 1998; baune et al., 1999; boxenbaum, 1999b; herman et al., 1999]. for example, human tf hepatic extraction goes from 95%
in the absence of a competitive inhibitor to 35%
in the presence of kt (200 mg oral intake every
12 h dosed to steady-state) [boxenbaum, 1999a].
clinical patients coadministration of kt and tf
induced a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
that is associated with prolongation of the qt
interval [monahan et al., 1990]. the cardiotoxic
effects were demonstrated in tf–kt cotherapy
in animal experimental model [hey et al.,
1996a,b; roberts and llenas, 1996]. although
some adverse effects was observed by tf–kt
cotherapy in patients, the molecular mechanisms of the drug–drug interactions involved in
these adverse effects were not clearly investigated. our results provide the molecular basis
of tf–kt interactions in vitro and such results
required further investigations in animal
experiment.
