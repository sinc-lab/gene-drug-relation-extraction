results. a series of compounds (1b-11) was chosen
from the literature that had been previously tested in
rodent models of diabetes.4,7,9-11 clofibric acid (1b), the
active form of  xxxd1724xxx  (1a),15 was purchased from
sigma. compounds 2-11 were synthesized by the
literature methods.7,9-11 the compounds were tested
in a transient transfection assay in cv-1 cells for their
ability to activate ppars. to allow comparison of the
relative transcriptional activity of the three receptors
on the same target gene and to prevent endogenous
receptors from complicating the interpretation of results, an established receptor chimera system was
used.14 the ligand binding domains of mouse pparr,
 xxxg1807xxx , and  xxxg1806xxx  were each fused to the dnabinding domain of the yeast transcription factor gal4.
cv-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression
vectors for the respective ppar chimera together with
a reporter construct containing five copies of the gal4
upstream activator element driving expression of secreted  xxxg149xxx  (spap). weak
activity on pparr was observed for only 1b and 2, and
no activity was seen on  xxxg1806xxx  for any of the compounds
(table 1). by contrast, it was found that all the
compounds (1b-11) were efficacious activators of  xxxg1807xxx ,
showing 25-30-fold induction of reporter gene activity
at the highest dose tested (data not shown). the
potency of compounds 1b-11 as judged by the ec50 for
 xxxg1807xxx  activity, was structure dependent and spanned
a wide dose range from millimolar (for 1b) to nanomolar
(for 10).
in addition to screening for functional activity in cells,
compounds 1b-11 were tested for their ability to bind
directly to  xxxg1807xxx  in vitro. [3h]-6 was prepared by
tritiodebromination of 12 (scheme 1). [3h]-6 was isolated with a specific activity of 41 ci/mmol. the ligand
binding domain of  xxxg1807xxx  was expressed in escherichia
coli as a fusion protein with  xxxg1073xxx .14
in competition binding assays, compounds 1b-11 showed
specific displacement of [3h]-6 from the  xxxg1807xxx  ligand
binding domain fusion protein. thus, compounds 1b11 are  xxxg1807xxx  agonists since they bind directly to the
receptor and activate transcription in a comparable dose
range.

introduction. resistance of peripheral tissues to the
action of insulin is a characteristic feature of human
obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes (niddm).1
a number of prospective studies have shown that the
development of insulin resistance is an early event in
the natural progression of the disease.2 thus, drugs
that reverse the onset of insulin resistance fulfill a major
unmet medical need for the treatment of niddm.3
thiazolidinediones are a class of oral insulin-sensitizing
agents that improve glucose utilization without stimulating insulin release. they significantly reduce glucose, lipid, and insulin levels in rodent models of
niddm and obesity,4 and recent clinical data supports
their efficacy in obese diabetic patients.5 the original
lead for the identification of this class of compounds was
 xxxd1724xxx  (1a, figure 1), which possesses both antilipidemic and weak antihyperglycemic activity in humans.6
scientists at takeda, through screening analogs of 1a
for increased antihyperglycemic activity in diabetic
mice, identified the acid 2 and subsequently the thiazolidinedione 3 (ciglitazone).7 although the molecular
mechanism of action remained unknown, analog synthesis and in vivo screening over a period of 15 years
led to the identification of thiazolidinediones with
increased potency.8 examples of thiazolidinediones that
have progressed to clinical evaluation are the pfizer
compound englitazone (4),11 the takeda compound
pioglitazone (5),9 and the beecham compound brl
49653 (6).10
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars)
are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of
ligand-activated transcription factors. three subtypes
of ppars have been cloned from mouse and human:
pparr,  xxxg1807xxx , and  xxxg1806xxx  (also known as  xxxg1806xxx ).12
the ppars are believed to play a physiological role in
the regulation of lipid metabolism. they can be activated by high concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx  (fa) and
have been shown to regulate the expression levels of
fa binding proteins or enzymes involved in fa oxidation.13 since the natural ligand for these receptors has
yet to be identified, they are classified as “orphan”
receptors. we recently identified the thiazolidinedione

discussion. the results in table 1 show that thiazolidinediones 3-11 were selective  xxxg1807xxx  agonists,
whereas acids 1b and 2, although less potent, showed
comparable activity on pparr and  xxxg1807xxx . none of
the compounds demonstrated measurable activity on
 xxxg1806xxx .16 compounds 3 and 5-10 have been reported

a gal4-ppar chimeric expression constructs were prepared as described previously (ref 14). reporter plasmid uas-tk-spap was
generated by insertion of five copies of a gal4 dna-binding element into pg12-tk-spap (ref 22). cv-1 cells were transfected with the
relevant receptor expression plasmid, reporter construct and beta-galactosidase expression plasmid (pch110, pharmacia) as described
previously (ref 14). after 16 h, the medium was exchanged to dme medium supplemented with 10% delipidated fetal calf serum and the
test compound at the appropriate concentration. after an additional 24 h, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for alkaline phosphatase
activity and beta-galactosidase activity. alkaline phosphatase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency using the beta-galactosidase
activity as internal standard (ref 23). ec50 equals the concentration of compound required to induce 50% of the maximum alkaline

table 1 shows that compounds 1b, 2, 4, and 11 also
demonstrated  xxxg1807xxx  agonist activity. compound 11
was reported to be inactive at 1000 µmol kg-1 in ob/ob
mice,10a and figure 2 predicts that a dose of >10 000
µmol kg-1 would be required to show in vivo activity.
thus, the in vitro  xxxg1807xxx  activity of 11 is consistent
with the reported in vivo data. englitazone (4) was
reported to be active in ob/ob mice at doses comparable
to ciglitazone (3);11 however, differences in dosing
regimes (diet vs gavage) and duration of study (8 vs 4
d) did not allow inclusion of this compound in the
correlation.10,11 finally, the activities of 1b and 2 have
not been reported in ob/ob mice, although 2 was reported
to lower blood glucose in diabetic kk-ay mice at high
doses (0.2% of diet for 4 d).7a
within a single compound class that is known to have
acceptable pharmacokinetic properties, it is likely that
differences in in vivo potency reflect changes in the
pharmacodynamic properties of the molecules. thus,
the correlation between in vivo potency of compounds
3 and 5-10 and the measured in vitro activity implicates  xxxg1807xxx  as the molecular target for the antidiabetic
effects of thiazolidinediones.18  xxxg1807xxx  is predominantly
expressed in adipose tissue,19 and it was recently shown
that  xxxg1807xxx , through ectopic expression, can act as a
master regulator of adipocyte differentiation in preadipocyte and multipotential cell lines.14,20 since skeletal muscle is the predominant insulin-sensitive tissue
in the body, accounting for >80% of the insulinregulated glucose disposal, an increase in glucose
disposal in adipocytes alone is unlikely to account for
the dramatic antihyperglycemic activity of the thiazolidinediones. thus, the mechanism by which activation
of  xxxg1807xxx -regulated genes in adipocytes reverses insulin
resistance remains to be discovered.21
conclusion. the structure-activity relationship for
 xxxg1807xxx  agonist activity in vitro accurately predicts the
in vivo antihyperglycemic activity of thiazolidinediones
in diabetic mice. the ability to rapidly screen compounds against this target in radioligand competitionbinding and functional transactivation assays should
allow the rapid development of more potent and selective antidiabetic agents.
