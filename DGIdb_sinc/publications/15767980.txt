differential regulation of thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor by low molecular weight heparins. pharmacologic implications.  thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor (tafi) is activated via cleavage by thrombin  xxxg2277xxx  in complex, and can be regulated by anticoagulant drugs such as the heparins. low molecular weight heparins (lmwhs) have different antithrombin/anti-xa profiles and therefore vary in the degree to which they inhibit tafi. the purpose of this study was to determine the differential regulation of tafi by lmwhs.
