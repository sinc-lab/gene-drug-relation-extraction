perspective
 xxxd92xxx  for age-related macular degeneration:
a game-changer or quiet addition?
david j. browning, peter k. kaiser, philip j. rosenfeld, and michael w. stewart
● purpose: to describe the pharmacokinetics, preclinical studies, and clinical trials of the newly approved
anti– xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) drug
 xxxd92xxx  ( xxxd92xxx  ( xxxd92xxx ); regeneron; and
bayer).
● design: review with editorial commentary.
● methods: a review of the medical literature and
pertinent internet postings combined with analysis of key
studies with expert opinion regarding the use of  xxxd92xxx  for the treatment of exudative age-related macular
degeneration.
● results:  xxxd92xxx , a fusion protein with binding
domains from native vegf receptors, binds  xxxg2413xxx ,
 xxxg2414xxx , and placental growth factors 1 and 2 with high
affinity. preclinical ophthalmologic studies demonstrated
that  xxxd92xxx  suppresses choroidal neovascularization
in several animal models. the results of phase 1 and 2
trials showed excellent short-term suppression of choroidal neovascularization in patients with exudative agerelated macular degeneration and suggested a longer
durability of  xxxd92xxx  compared with other  xxxd328xxx 
drugs. the pivotal phase 3 vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) trap-eye: investigation of efficacy and
safety in wet age-related macular degeneration 1 and
2 trials showed that monthly and bimonthly  xxxd92xxx 
were noninferior to monthly  xxxd3081xxx  at preventing
vision loss (< 15-letter loss) with comparable vision
gains and safety. year 2 treatment involved monthly pro
re nata injections with required injections every 3
months and maintained vision gains from the first year,
with an average of 4.2 injections of  xxxd92xxx  and 4.7
injections of  xxxd3081xxx .
● conclusions:  xxxd92xxx  promises to deliver excellent visual outcomes for exudative age-related macular
degeneration patients while undergoing fewer injections
compared with  xxxd3081xxx . with a wholesale cost of
$1850 per dose, the cost per patient with  xxxd92xxx

t

he recent introduction of drugs that inhibit

the actions of  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf) has revolutionized the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (amd). current
 xxxd328xxx  drugs bind to vegf in the extracellular space
and prevent its activation of transmembrane vegf receptors. between 2004 and 2006, 3  xxxd328xxx  drugs were
introduced to ophthalmology either after receiving regulatory approval for the treatment of amd or being used in
an off-label manner. they exhibit important differences in
their sites of activity, formulation methods, binding affinities, and biologic activities. pegaptanib (macugen;
eyetech, new york, new york, usa) is a ribonucleic acid
aptamer that blocks the main pathologic isoform of vegf
( xxxg1608xxx ) by attaching to its heparin binding domain,
whereas  xxxd3081xxx  (lucentis; novartis, basel, switzerland; genentech, south san francisco, california, usa;
and roche, basel, switzerland) and bevacizumab (avastin;
genentech and roche) are, respectively, an affinitymatured, humanized, monoclonal antibody fragment and a
full-length, humanized, monoclonal antibody to vegf.
both work by blocking the receptor binding domain of all
isoforms of  xxxg2413xxx .1
now, more than 5 years later, the next  xxxd328xxx  drug,
 xxxd92xxx  ( xxxd92xxx ; regeneron, tarrytown, new york,
usa, and bayer, berlin, germany) has been approved by
the united states food and drug administration. this
soluble decoy receptor is produced by fusing all-human
dna sequences of the second immunoglobulin (ig) domain of human vegf receptor (vegfr) 1 to the third ig
domain of human  xxxg1274xxx , which then is fused to the fc
region of  xxxd2207xxx -1.2  xxxd92xxx  binds to all  xxxg2413xxx 
and  xxxg2414xxx  isoforms, as well as the highly related
 xxxg1734xxx .  xxxd92xxx  is produced in a
chinese hamster ovary cell line, and then is specially
purified and formulated exclusively for intraocular injection.
when developing  xxxd92xxx , investigators noted that
most of the vasoproliferative and hyperpermeability effects
of vegf are mediated by activation of  xxxg1274xxx , yet

 xxxg800xxx  actually binds to  xxxg2413xxx  with a much higher
affinity (kd ⫽ 10 to 20 pm vs kd ⫽ 100 to 300 pm; binding
affinity is inversely proportional to kd). therefore, investigators initially created a parent  xxxd92xxx  with 3
binding domains from the high-affinity  xxxg800xxx  fused to
the fc region of igg1. although this molecule bound
vegf tightly, it exhibited unfavorable pharmacokinetic
characteristics as a result of rapid sequestration within the
intercellular matrix. by substituting the more basic binding
sequences from  xxxg1274xxx , regeneron developed a highaffinity (kd ⫽ 0.5 pm) soluble receptor molecule that
exhibited minimal binding to the extracellular matrix.2
this gives  xxxd92xxx  a significantly higher binding affinity
to  xxxg1608xxx  than either bevacizumab (kd ⫽ 58 pm) or
 xxxd3081xxx  (kd ⫽ 46 pm).3 the intravitreal half-life of
 xxxd92xxx  is 4.7 days in rabbits (regeneron, data on file),
comparable with that of bevacizumab (4.32 days), but
longer than that of  xxxd3081xxx  (2.88 days). although
pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in
human eyes, the molecular size of  xxxd92xxx  (115 kda)
would suggest that its intraocular half-life would more
closely resemble bevacizumab (149 kda; human half-life,
8.24 days) than the smaller  xxxd3081xxx  (48 kda).4
the predicted biological activity of a therapeutic macromolecule depends to a large degree on both its intraocular half-life and its vegf binding affinity.5 the binding
affinity of  xxxd92xxx  to  xxxg2413xxx  is substantially greater
than any of the other 3  xxxd328xxx  drugs, but recent
biological assays with  xxxd92xxx ,  xxxd3081xxx , and bevacizumab report that the relative inhibition of both endothelial cell proliferation and migration ranges from 1⫻ to
100⫻.3,6 the reason for this wide variation in inhibitory
effects is unknown, but the use of different reagent concentrations has been suggested.3 based on these data and
estimated intraocular drug half-lives, mathematical modeling predicts that a single intravitreal injection of  xxxd92xxx  2 mg would last between 48 and 83 days (compared
with 30 days for  xxxd3081xxx ).5

preclinical and oncology trials

 xxxd92xxx  has decreased tumor growth successfully in
several orthotopic mouse models: ovarian carcinoma,
hepatoblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal
carcinoma, wilms tumor, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma.7 suppression of experimental neuroblastoma
growth by  xxxd328xxx  agents was achieved with the following relative efficacies:  xxxd92xxx  ⬎ monoclonal antibody ⬎ aptamer to  xxxg1608xxx .8
phase 1 and 2 oncologic studies evaluated escalating
doses of  xxxd92xxx  in patients with chemotherapy-resistant renal cell carcinoma, hodgkin lymphoma, glioblastoma, and anaplastic glioma. in a phase 3 trial of patients
with advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon, intravenously administered  xxxd92xxx  ( xxxd92xxx ; regeneron and
sanofi aventis, bridgewater, new jersey, usa) extended
progression-free survival from 4.7 to 6.9 months (p ⫽
.00007) and overall survival from 12.1 to 13.5 months
(p ⫽ .0032).9
in ocular preclinical studies,  xxxd92xxx  demonstrated in
vivo activity against several murine models of choroidal
neovascularization (cnv). it prevented the development
of cnv after intense laser photocoagulation to the retinal
pigment epithelium, inhibited the development of cnv in
vegf-secreting transgenic mice, and prevented the development of cnv in mice receiving exogenous vegf.10
this favorable response in part was the result of decreases
in both intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and endothelial
 xxxd2738xxx  synthetase synthesis within the cnv.11 after
matrigel-induced cnv in rats,  xxxd92xxx  injections at 2
and 6 days prevented the development of cnv, whereas
injections  xxxd1891xxx  days decreased collagen synthesis and
leukocyte infiltration.12 prolonged, high-dose  xxxd92xxx 
therapy causes loss of both endothelial cells and pericytes,
thereby reducing vessels to basement membrane ghosts.13
these successful preclinical studies justified the development of  xxxd92xxx  trials for the treatment of exudative
amd in humans.

ophthalmology trials
based on a plausible biologic rationale for sus-

the development of our currently used  xxxd328xxx 

drugs was based on a different long-term therapeutic
strategy. whereas bevacizumab was developed with a long
systemic residence time exclusively for the systemic treatment of advanced cancers,  xxxd3081xxx  was designed to
have a short systemic clearance half-life by removing the
fc fragment from the parent igg molecule, and its affinity
for vegf was enhanced by changing 5 of its amino acids,
thereby optimizing it for the intraocular treatment of
exudative ocular diseases. additionally, creating a molecule smaller than the retinal exclusion limit (76 kda) was
believed to be necessary to penetrate the inner retina.
 xxxd92xxx , however, was developed to treat both advanced solid tumors and ophthalmic vascular conditions.

for

pected efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in preclinical animal studies,  xxxd92xxx  first was administered
intravenously to patients with neovascular amd in a
placebo-controlled clinical trial.14 in 2 of the 5 patients
receiving 3.0 mg/kg  xxxd92xxx , systemic toxicity developed (1 patient had grade 2 proteinuria and 1 patient had
grade 4 hypertension). a subsequent phase 1 study of
intravitreal  xxxd92xxx  showed that up to 4-mg dosing
decreased macular edema and subretinal fluid for at least 6
weeks and was tolerated well with no ocular inflammation.15 a phase 2 clinical trial of 159 patients explored 5
different  xxxd92xxx  dosing regimens with a primary outcome at 12 weeks: 0.5 mg every 4 weeks, 2 mg every 4
weeks, 0.5 mg every 12 weeks, 2 mg every 12 weeks (thus,

every 12 weeks. at 12 weeks, quarterly dosing reduced
macular thickening and improved best-corrected visual
acuity, but monthly dosing was more effective.16 the same
group of patients subsequently was followed up monthly
and was retreated pro re nata with their assigned dose
based on the following criteria: central retinal or lesion
thickness increased 100 ␮m or more from best previous
reading or best-corrected vision dropped 5 or more letters
with recurrent fluid on optical coherence tomography if
persistent fluid was seen on optical coherence tomography
or if there was new cnv, persistent leakage on fluorescein
angiography, or a new macular hemorrhage.17 pro re nata
dosing maintained the efficacy established in each of the 5
groups during the first part of the trial. at 52 weeks of
follow-up, patients in the initial monthly dosing regimens
tended to have improved visual acuity outcomes compared
with those in the quarterly dosing groups, regardless of the
 xxxd92xxx  dose, indicating the importance of loading dose
before the less frequent dosing.
based on the results from these phase 1 and 2 studies, 2
parallel phase 3 pivotal clinical trials were designed and
conducted to establish the noninferiority of 3 regimens of
 xxxd92xxx  compared with monthly  xxxd3081xxx  0.5 mg.
these trials were the  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf) trap-eye: investigation of efficacy and safety in
wet age-related macular degeneration study 1, a study
of 1217 patients in the united states and canada, and the
 xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) trap-eye:
investigation of efficacy and safety in wet age-related
macular degeneration study 2, a study of 1240 patients in
europe, asia, japan, and latin america.18 in both trials,
patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 4 groups:  xxxd3081xxx  0.5 mg given monthly,  xxxd92xxx  0.5 mg given
monthly,  xxxd92xxx  2 mg given monthly, and  xxxd92xxx  2
mg given monthly for 3 injections followed by continued
injections every 2 months. the end point for both trials
was at 52 weeks. the primary outcome measure, termed
maintenance of vision, was the percentage of eyes losing
fewer than 3 lines of visual acuity on the early treatment
diabetic retinopathy chart. a secondary visual acuity

outcome was mean improvement in visual acuity measured
in number of additional letters read on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy chart compared with baseline.
both studies showed that all 3 regimens of  xxxd92xxx 
were noninferior to the  xxxd3081xxx  monthly regimen
(table). of greatest interest to clinicians was the  xxxd92xxx  arm featuring bimonthly injections after 3 monthly
loading doses. this regimen offers fewer injections for the
patient, less risk of endophthalmitis, and no loss of efficacy
at least through 52 weeks.
the secondary outcomes were concordant with the
primary outcomes (table). both studies showed that all 3
 xxxd92xxx  regimens were associated with mean visual
acuity improvements and were noninferior to the  xxxd3081xxx  monthly regimen.18 ocular adverse events in both
studies were balanced across the 4 treatment groups and
were those commonly associated with intravitreal injections for exudative amd: conjunctival hemorrhages, eye
pain, and vitreous floaters. systemic adverse events also
were balanced across the groups and were those commonly
found in elderly patients with exudative amd: falls,
pneumonia, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. there was
no evidence to suggest that any arm was associated with an
increased risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or
myocardial infarction.18
in year 2 of both trials, patients in all 4 groups were
continued on the same drug and dosage to which they were
originally randomized, but with a modified frequency. repeat
injections were administered as frequently as every month if
patients met prespecified optical coherence tomography or
visual acuity retreatment criteria, or both, but all patients
were required to receive an injection once every 3 months. in
an integrated analysis of both trials, patients initially receiving  xxxd92xxx  2 mg every 8 weeks, and those receiving
 xxxd3081xxx  0.5 mg every 4 weeks maintained the vision
gains reported at week 52 through week 96 (⫹8.4 letters to
⫹7.6 letters vs ⫹8.7 letters to ⫹7.9 letters, respectively). on
average, patients in both groups required relatively few
injections during the second year ( xxxd92xxx , 4.2 injections;
 xxxd3081xxx , 4.7 injections). the proportion of patients that
required 6 or more injections in the second year was higher in

drug and treatment regimens
in 2008, bevacizumab was used for 60% of the anti-

vegf injections in medicare-fee-for-service beneficiaries
with exudative amd.20 in 2011, the patterns and trends
survey by the american society of retina specialists
reported that 70% of retina specialists used bevacizumab
compared with  xxxd3081xxx  for exudative amd. the
preference for off-label bevacizumab was influenced by its
low cost and the perception that its efficacy and safety were
similar to  xxxd3081xxx , which was confirmed by the 1-year
results of the comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatment trials.21 this is in contrast to the use of
 xxxd3081xxx , which was influenced by the clinical efficacy
demonstrated in its extensive phase 3 testing and its
on-label status. in addition to the difference in cost
between the 2 drugs, there are other financial incentives,
such as volume discounts to high-using physicians and the
accumulation of frequent flyer miles for credit card purchases, and disincentives that can influence the use of one
drug over the other in clinical practice.22
now that  xxxd92xxx  is approved in the united states
for exudative amd, how will clinicians decide between
these available  xxxd328xxx  drugs and the different treatment regimens? most likely, those clinicians using a given
 xxxd328xxx  therapy because of the financial incentives will
continue using the same drug as their first-line treatment,
at least in the short term. for those clinicians using
 xxxd3081xxx  because it is the approved on-label treatment
for exudative amd, the use of  xxxd92xxx  will begin
cautiously for 2 reasons. first, clinicians need to be assured
that medicare will reimburse  xxxd92xxx  in a timely fashion, and second, retina specialists will want to gain some
experience with  xxxd92xxx  with selected patients, particularly patients who have required frequent retreatment
with  xxxd3081xxx . if postapproval experience confirms
clinical trial evidence that  xxxd92xxx  has a longer duration
of effect than  xxxd3081xxx  and medicare reliably reimburses  xxxd92xxx  claims, then the use of  xxxd92xxx  in this
population of patients should accelerate. for those clinicians using bevacizumab because of its low cost, the
transition to  xxxd92xxx  will be slowed by its cost, which is
only $100 less than  xxxd3081xxx  but still $1800 more than

bevacizumab. however, when cost is denominated by time
between injections, the total cost of  xxxd92xxx  treatment
is not so near to that of  xxxd3081xxx  as the per-vial cost
would suggest, and therefore adoption by cost-conscious
clinicians may be faster than expected. moreover, if
 xxxd92xxx  proves to be more effective in reducing the need
for retreatment, this will provide further impetus driving
conversion of bevacizumab patients to  xxxd92xxx , because
monthly bevacizumab was the only regimen shown to be
equivalent to  xxxd3081xxx  in the comparison of agerelated macular degeneration treatment trials.  xxxd92xxx  already has received its medicare j-code, and if we
assume that its durability proves to be superior to current
 xxxd328xxx  therapies in treating exudative amd patients,
then we should assume that  xxxd92xxx  would become the
dominant on-label drug for the treatment of exudative
amd.
it is unlikely that clinicians will adopt a treatment
regimen that is significantly different from the current
regimens used in clinical practice. the 2011 patterns and
trends survey showed that most clinicians used a treatand-extend (60%) or a treat-and-observe (32%) strategy,
rather than the fixed treatment intervals used in the phase
3 trials and comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatment trials. although the  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) trap-eye: investigation of
efficacy and safety in wet age-related macular degeneration trials demonstrated noninferiority compared with
monthly  xxxd3081xxx  when  xxxd92xxx  was given monthly
for 3 doses followed by doses every 2 months, most
clinicians likely will continue to customize their management strategy to reduce the number of visits and injections
without compromising visual acuity outcomes.
 xxxd92xxx  is a useful addition to our treatment armamentarium. although visual acuity outcomes should be
the same as monthly  xxxd3081xxx  or bevacizumab, the
patients could benefit by receiving fewer injections, and
clinicians will benefit by seeing these patients less often.
however, this decrease in the total number of visits and
injections may be short lived. as new patients are diagnosed with exudative amd and require treatment, the
overall number of injections will once again increase. for
the individual patient who requires fewer visits to the
physician’s office and fewer injections,  xxxd92xxx  is definitely a game changer. for the clinician, it is only a
temporary reprieve until even longer-acting therapies
arrive.
