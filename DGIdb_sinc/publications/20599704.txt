a b s t r a c t
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) is a key lipid-derived compound which mediates important physiological functions in the nervous system via activation of four ep receptors (ep1–4). recent studies have shown that
altered pge2 signalling due to abnormal lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress may underlie some
pathologies of the nervous system. the prenatal exposure to the drug misoprostol, a prostaglandin type
e analogue, has also been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental defects. in the present study, we use
ratiometric calcium imaging with fura-2am as a calcium indicator to determine the effects of pge2 and
misoprostol on calcium homeostasis in growth cones of mouse neuroblastoma (neuro-2a) cells. our
results show that both drugs increase the amplitude of calcium transients in growth cones of neuro2a cells and induce neurite retraction. moreover, quantitative real-time pcr also revealed that the mrna
expression level of the four ep receptors was signiﬁcantly higher during the neurogenesis period in
mouse indicating the importance of pge2 signalling in the nervous system.

1. introduction
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2), the major prostaglandin in the nervous
system, is derived from the metabolism of the plasma membrane
phospholipid  xxxd208xxx  [1]. pge2 exerts its diverse effects
through four g-protein coupled e-prostanoid receptors (ep1–4).
it has been shown that ep1 is often involved in regulation of intracellular calcium levels by the action of phospholipase c (plc) and
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3),  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors usually
mediate activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) through the action
of  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) and  xxxg1874xxx  can
modulate both camp and calcium level via different mechanisms
depending on the type of associated g-proteins [1,2]. pge2 is involved in various functions in the nervous system such as fever
[3], inﬂammation [4] and pain response [5]. recent studies also
suggest an important role for pge2 signalling in development [6],
synaptic plasticity and formation of dendritic spines [7–9]. it has
been reported that pge2 interferes with differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma (pc12) cells overexpressing bovine  xxxg1874xxx 
isoforms [10,11].
evidence also suggests that dysregulation in prostaglandin signalling due to altered lipid metabolism might be linked to pathologies of the nervous system. recent studies have identiﬁed elevated

levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress biomarkers such as
8-isoprostane- xxxd1902xxx , in the plasma of individuals with autism
spectrum disorders [12,13]. moreover, prenatal exposure to the
drug misoprostol, a prostaglandin type e analogue, during the ﬁrst
and second trimester of pregnancy has been linked to a number of
malformations and neurodevelopmental defects indicating that it
may have neurotoxic effects on the developing nervous system
[14,15]. although there is no direct molecular evidence that altered
pge2 signalling by the drug misoprostol or the endogenous pge2
affects early neuronal development in vivo it has been shown that
they acts on the same g-protein receptors with different afﬁnities
[1,16]. therefore, cellular responses evoked by misoprostol and
pge2 in neuronal cells might take place by similar mechanisms.
this study tests the hypothesis that both misoprostol and pge2
alter differentiation of mouse neuroblastoma (neuro-2a) cell line,
used as an experimental model for neuronal cells. for the ﬁrst time
we show that both drugs affect the amplitude of calcium ﬂuctuation
in growth cones and interfere with neurite outgrowth. furthermore,
we elucidate the potential effect these ligands might have on the
nervous system by evaluating the expression level of ep receptors’
mrna during mouse embryonic development and the adult brain.

neuro-2a cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer as described previously [17,18]. the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit
polyclonal anti-ep1 (alpha diagnostic international), - xxxg1873xxx , -ep3 or
- xxxg1875xxx  (santa cruz biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal anti- xxxd3440xxx  [ac-15] (abcam). anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (santa cruz biotechnology) were detected with geliance 600 imaging system (perkinelmer) using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ecl,
millipore).

2.3. calcium imaging

3.1. expression of ep1–4 receptors in neuro-2a cells

real-time calcium imaging was performed using ratiometric
method of intracellular calcium ([ca2+]i) measurement with fura2-acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2am, invitrogen) calcium indicator
with a nikon eclipse ti-e microscope as we previously described
[17]. the 340/380 ratio (ca2+-bound to ca2+-free fura-2) was converted to calcium concentration [17,19].

real-time rt-pcr assay and western blot analysis were performed to determine whether neuro-2a cells endogenously express the ep receptors. results show that the levels of ep3c and
 xxxg1875xxx  transcripts were the highest followed by the  xxxg1873xxx 
(fig. 1a). the relative quantity (rq = 1) values of ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3a,
ep3b, e3pc and  xxxg1875xxx  transcripts expression were 2, 16, 1, 2, 46
and 46, respectively (fig. 1a). our western blot results conﬁrmed
that neuro-2a cells express all four ep receptor at varying levels
(fig. 1b) and hence can serve as a good experimental model for
studying pge2 signalling.

2.4. pge2 and misoprostol treatments
the basal 340/380 ratio (r) value was measured before adding
the drugs to establish a stable baseline of calcium level. after addition of 0.1 or 1.0 lm pge2 and misoprostol, the cells were monitored for a total of 10 min. the measurements were taken every
5 s for the ﬁrst 3 min and 20 s for the reminder of the time. calcium
concentration in the growth cones was measured by assessing the
changes in the amplitude of 340/380 ratio. the maximum and minimum values of the 340/380 ratios were averaged ( xxxd340xxx /380max
and  xxxd340xxx /380min) in untreated and drug-treated differentiated cell
and the difference between  xxxd340xxx /380max and  xxxd340xxx /380min ( xxxd340xxx /
380max–min) was obtained in the drug-treated cells and compared
to  xxxd340xxx /380max–min in the untreated cells.
2.5. reverse transcription and real-time pcr
real-time pcr was performed using the 7500 fast real-time
pcr system (applied biosystems) as we described previously
[17]. total rna from mouse embryonic day (e)7, 11, 15 and 17,
cortex, frontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus,
brain stem, medulla oblongata and cerebellum of adult mouse
brain was used (clontech), as well as total rna isolated from
neuro-2a cells (nucleospin ii). the forward and reverse primers
are shown in table 1. ddc t method was employed to calculate
the receptors’ expression with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl
transferase ( xxxg1075xxx ) [20] as the endogenous control. the relative
quantiﬁcation (rq) of each ep receptor at different embryonic
stages compared to e17 and to the entire cortex for each brain
region.
2.6. data analysis
statistical analysis was performed with student’s t-test to compare between the mean of each group to a reference group. a value
of p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3.2. effects of  xxxd1903xxx  and misoprostol treatments on growth
cone calcium amplitude
[ca2+]i in neuro-2a cells were determined using the ratiometric
fura-2am calcium indicator [17,19]. the maximum fura-2 340/380
ratio (rmax) in the presence of 4 lm  xxxd2379xxx  was 3.928 and the
minimum ratio (rmin) in the presence of 15 mm egta was 0.382
(n = 271; data not shown). no signiﬁcant increase in cytosolic
[ca2+]i was observed after treatment with 0.1 or 1.0 of pge2 or
misoprostol (data not shown). since neurite outgrowth is a calcium-dependent process and occurs over an optimal range of concentrations [21,22] we measured the effects of the drugs on the
ﬂuctuation of calcium in growth cones of the differentiated cells.
the results show that the basal  xxxd340xxx /380max–min was 0.15
(n = 382, fig. 2a, ctr). 0.1 and 1.0 lm concentrations of pge2 or
misoprostol induced a signiﬁcantly greater ﬂuctuation of calcium.
the  xxxd340xxx /380max–min for pge2 was 0.25 (n = 111, p = 0.0039) and
0.22 (n = 75, p = 0.034), respectively (fig. 2a, immediate). similarly, the  xxxd340xxx /380max–min values for 0.1 and 1.0 lm misoprostol
were 0.23 (n = 130, p = 0.015) and 0.27 (n = 46, p = 0.0010)
(fig. 2b, immediate). overall, 0.1 and 1.0 lm concentrations of
the drugs elevated calcium amplitude by 67% and 47% for pge2
and by 53% and 80% for misoprostol, respectively. after 24 h exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 lm pge2  xxxd340xxx /380max–min was 0.27 (n = 72,
p = 0.0013) and 0.19 (n = 26), respectively (fig. 2a, 24 h). in response to the corresponding misoprostol concentrations  xxxd340xxx /
380max–min was 0.24 (n = 84, p = 0.0060) and 0.24 (n = 77,
p = 0.0034) (fig. 2b, 24 h). compared to the baseline calcium ﬂuctuations were elevated by 80% and 27% following treatment with
0.1 and 1.0 lm concentrations of pge2 and by 60% in response to
the same concentrations of misoprostol. greater ﬂuctuations were
observed in response to 0.1 lm pge2 and 0.1 and 1.0 lm misoprostol. these results demonstrate that acute and prolonged exposure

to both drugs has a signiﬁcant effect on growth cone calcium
dynamics in neuro-2a cells.
3.3. effects of  xxxd1903xxx  and misoprostol treatments on the
length of neurite extensions
given that proper range of calcium transients is required for
neuronal outgrowth we also measured whether the drugs have
an impact on neuronal length and differentiation after 24 h exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 lm pge2 or misoprostol. the average length
of neuronal extensions in the untreated cells was 41 lm
(n = 121, fig. 2c, ctr). the treatment with 0.1 and 1.0 lm pge2
signiﬁcantly reduced the length of the neurites to 32 lm
(n = 149, p = 0.028) and 20 lm (n = 252, p = 0.0068), respectively
(fig. 2c). this corresponds to 22% and 51% reduction in length.
likewise misoprostol treatment resulted in retraction of the neuronal extension to 28 lm (n = 238, p = 0.0055) and 20 lm (n = 371,

p = 0.0011) in response to 0.1 and 1.0 lm of misoprostol, respectively (fig. 2c). this was equivalent of 32% and 51% reduction in
neurite length. moreover, the drug treatments affected the total
number of differentiated cells. fig. 2d illustrates an example of untreated differentiated neuro-2a cells and cells treated with 1.0 lm
misoprostol. in response to 1.0 lm pge2 or misoprostol the total
number of differentiated cells was reduced by 53% and 34%,
respectively. we did not see an overall reduction in total neurite
number with 0.1 lm concentration. these results demonstrate that
exposure to both drugs results in retraction of neurite extensions
and reduction in the number of total differentiated cells.
3.4. temporal expression pattern of ep receptors during mouse
embryonic development
in order to elucidate the potential effect of pge2 and misoprostol on the nervous system we assessed the expression level of

453

j. tamiji, d.a. crawford / biochemical and biophysical research communications 398 (2010) 450–456

mrna for the ep receptors (ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3a, ep3b, ep3c and  xxxg1875xxx ) in
mouse embryos at days 7, 11, 15 and 17 (e7, e11, e15 and e17). the
relative quantiﬁcation (rq) of ep1,  xxxg1873xxx  and ep3b receptors exhibits
a signiﬁcant increase in the expression level at e15 (peak of neurogenesis; p = 0.015, p = 0.005 and p = 0.0072, respectively) (fig. 3).
ep3a and ep3b expression level was also signiﬁcantly higher at
e7, part of organogenesis (p = 0.0018 and p = 0.0009, respectively).
the ep3c receptor shows relatively uniform expression in all
developmental stages with e7 being the highest expression. the
 xxxg1875xxx  was predominantly expressed at signiﬁcantly higher
levels (about 120-fold increase) at e7 (p = 0.0097) as compared to
e17 which indicates that its primary role might be in the earlier
stages of development.
3.5. spatial expression pattern of ep receptors in adult mouse brain
pge2 signalling may also contribute to neuronal communication
of the mature nervous system. thus, we assessed the mrna
expression of the ep receptors within eight major regions of adult
mouse brain (cortex, frontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, medulla and cerebellum) (fig. 4). our data
indicates that the ep receptors are ubiquitously expressed in the
selected regions of the adult brain. more noticeable was the 1.5and 3-folds higher expression of ep1 and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors in frontal
cortex as compared to the total cerebral cortex, respectively. interestingly, the expression of all of the ep receptors was signiﬁcantly

a

4. discussion
the results of this study show that pge2 and misoprostol increase the amplitude of calcium ﬂuctuations in growth cones and
signiﬁcantly reduce the length and number of neuronal extensions.
in addition, the mrna expression level of the ep receptors was
high during the neurogenesis period and relatively uniform in various regions of the adult brain, indicating that the drugs might
have diverse effects on the developing and adult nervous systems.
calcium ﬂuctuation in neuronal growth cones, known as calcium transient, allows for a ﬁner and more precise regulation of
the calcium-mediated actions [23,24]. the existing literature
shows that calcium transients are important in many aspects of
growth cone regulation such as outgrowth and turning [25] and
therefore alteration in calcium dynamics of the growth cones
may interfere with its function. growth cones of the differentiated
neuro-2a cells exhibit intermittent calcium ﬂuctuations at the
basal level similar to neuronal cells. in this study, we show that
pge2 and misoprostol affect the amplitude of calcium transients

higher in the medulla oblongata. speciﬁcally,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3a, ep3b,
ep3c and  xxxg1875xxx  expressions in the medulla oblongata were
signiﬁcant at p < 0.0001, and  xxxg1872xxx  at p = 0.048. moreover,
ep3a expression was greater in hippocampus by 4-folds compared
to the cortex (p = 0.036). the remainder of the brain regions
seemed to express all of the ep receptors at a fairly constant level.

in the growth cones and reduce neurite outgrowth in those cells.
pge2-induced effects were more profound in response to the lower
concentration of pge2, while misoprostol showed similar results in
response to both concentrations used. this could be attributed to
the fact that the drugs activate different ep receptors [1], that the
receptors show different patterns of agonist-induced desensitization and internalization [26,27] or because the afﬁnity of misoprostol for the ep receptors is lower [1,16]. our results revealed that
greater amplitude of calcium ﬂuctuations in response to the pge2
and misoprostol concentrations were associated with a decrease
in neurite length. previous data has shown that an optimal range
of calcium concentration is required for maximum outgrowth of
neurons [21] and that higher transient frequencies are associated
with slower outgrowth, whereas lower frequencies with accelerate
growth rate [28]. these results suggest that altered pge2 signalling
may be involved in neurite retraction via calcium transients in
neuro-2a cells. however, other factors activated by ep receptors
may also contribute, including a small gtpase rho protein
[10,11,29] or production of protein kinase c (pkc) [18,30]. pkc,

however, is likely not involved in this experimental model since
it was blocked by h-7 during differentiation.
prostaglandins are not considered typical neurotransmitters because they are not stored in vesicles but they exert their effects in
the nervous system by diffusion and activation of speciﬁc ep receptors [1]. recent studies implicate pge2 in synaptic plasticity and
reﬁning of mature neuronal connections [8,31,32] but also provide
evidence for elevation of endogenous pge2 levels during events
such as inﬂammatory response and oxidative stress [33–35]. moreover, exposure to various maternal infections and altered lipid
metabolism has been linked to some cases of autism [36,37]. additionally, a number of clinical studies have shown that exposure to
misoprostol during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy can have adverse impacts on the development of the nervous system and lead
to cranial nerve defects and development of autism-like syndromes
[14,15]. to elucidate the importance of pge2 signalling in the nervous system, we quantiﬁed the mrna expression level of all the
ep receptors during various stages of mouse development. the results of our study demonstrate a signiﬁcant increase in expression

of ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3b and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors’ mrna between e11 and e15
(e15 being the peak of neurogenesis) compared to other embryonic
days, indicating that pge2 signalling may play an important role
during early neuronal development via activation of these receptors. development of brain structures, such as medulla, pons and
cerebellum, which start to develop at the early stages of the neurogenesis (around e12) [38] and others, such as, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus and entorhinal cortex begin developing at
around e15 [38] may potentially be affected by abnormal pge2 signalling. the analysis of the expression pattern of the ep receptors in
various brain regions of adult mouse brain revealed that ep1 and
 xxxg1875xxx  receptors were more highly expressed in the frontal cortex
compared the entire cortex suggesting their potentially important
role in this brain region. moreover, the expression of all the ep
receptors was signiﬁcantly greater in the medulla oblongata. interestingly, previous studies have shown that subpopulations of serotonergic, noradrenergic and adrenergic cell groups in rat medulla
oblongata highly express  xxxg1874xxx  [39], and suggest that ep3mediated pge2 responses may modulate important physiological
responses mediated by the neurotransmitters produced by those
neurons. evidence from a number of studies, involving both autistic
patients and rat animal model for autism, has identiﬁed abnormalities in the production and regulation of neurotransmitters such as
serotonin and dopamine, which may signify the importance of pge2
signalling in medulla [40,41]. disturbances in pge2 signalling as a
result of altered level of endogenous pge2 (due to inﬂammation
or infection) or exposure to drugs such as misoprostol might have
an adverse effect on various developmental stages due to differential expression of the ep receptors.
the results presented in this study provide the ﬁrst evidence
that pge2 and misoprostol affect the amplitude of calcium ﬂuctuations in growth cones of neuro-2a cells and affect neurite outgrowth. due to the differential expression of the ep receptors
during development these drugs may have diverse effects on the
nervous system. these results add valuable knowledge to the
important role of the pge2 pathway in the nervous system. further
studies on primary cells or in vivo using animal models are required
to determine the role of these drugs in neuronal development.
