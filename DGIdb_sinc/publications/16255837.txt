cutaneous  xxxg1601xxx  sensitivity and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in antidepressant-resistant depression.  there is evidence to indicate that peripheral  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) function is reduced in major depression, and a possible molecular explanation for this is the impact of raised pro-inflammatory cytokines. the topical steroid vasoconstriction assay provides a convenient probe of peripheral gr function. the present study sought to assess the sensitivity of peripheral grs in antidepressant-resistant major depressives and investigate the association between gr sensitivity and circulating plasma cytokines.
