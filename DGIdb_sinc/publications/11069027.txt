multidrug resistance (mdr) is a major problem in patients with
hematological malignancies. although drug-resistance is
known to be induced by the expression of p-glycoprotein (pgp) encoded by the mdr-1 gene, little is known about the mechanisms regulating this gene. herein, we studied the dna
methylation patterns at the enhancer and repressor binding
sites of the mdr-1 gene using the human erythroleukemia cell
line k562 and its multidrug resistant derivative k562/adm
(adriamycin). direct dna sequence analysis demonstrated
methylation to be present at the repressor site (minus 110 gcbox) of the mdr-1 gene in k562/adm cells, but not in parental
k562 cells. methylation-specific pcr (msp) analysis yielded
similar results. treatment of k562/adm cells with 5-aza-29deoxycytidine ( xxxd1823xxx ; dac), an inhibitor of dna methyltransferase, caused demethylation of the repressor binding site
of mdr-1 gene, as assessed by msp, and also decreased  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx 
expression, as assessed by flow cytometric and northern blot
analysis. although it is generally accepted that dac upregulates gene expression by demethylating the activator binding
sites, our present results suggest that dac induces downregulation of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression as a result of demethylation at
the repressor binding site in k562/adm cells. in this regard,
methylation-dependent regulation of the mdr-1 gene in
k562/adm cells is unique. leukemia (2000) 14, 1915–1920.

introduction
one of the major concerns arising in cancer chemotherapy
is multidrug resistance which is caused, at least in part, by
expression of p-glycoprotein ( xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx ). the mdr-1 gene encodes
 xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  which is an energy-dependent efflux pump and acts as
a transporter of various structurally unrelated compounds such
as  xxxd1800xxx , adriamycin, colchicine and vinca alkaloids.1–3 the gene regulation of the mdr-1 remains a controversial issue. the genomic structure of the 59-flanking region
of the mdr-1 gene was determined and the region upstream
from the major transcription start site was confirmed to have
promoter activity.4 this region contains putative caat- and
gc-boxes, but lacks the tata-box which is a common signal
for eukaryotic mrna transcription by rna polymerase ii.4
cornwell et al,5 using a luciferase assay, reported that the
-110 gc-box and -50 gc-box function as transcriptional
‘repressor’ and ‘enhancer’ binding sites, respectively.5 sp-1
(specificity protein-1) and egr-1 (early growth response gene1) have been shown to act as transcriptional activators for the
mdr-1 gene promoter.5,6
in higher-order eukaryotic cells, dna is methylated only at
cytosines located 59 to guanosine in the cpg dinucleotide.7
this modification has important regulatory effects on gene
expression, especially when involving cpg-rich areas known
as cpg islands, located in the promoter regions of many
genes.8,9 aberrant methylation of cpg islands, which are norcorrespondence: y oka; fax: 81 836 22 2342

mally unmethylated, has frequently been documented in
immortalized and transformed cells10 and has been associated
with transcriptional inactivation of defined tumor suppresser
genes in human cancers.11–14 for example, frequent methylation of the p15 gene promoter was shown to induce its
down-regulation in leukemias.15,16 hypermethylation in the
promoter region of the  xxxg730xxx  was also shown to
lead to its down-regulation in breast cancers.17 a similar
mechanism might act in mdr-1 gene regulation.
in the present investigation, we analyzed the methylation
pattern of -110 and -50 gc-boxes in the mdr-1 promoter
region in k562 and k562/adm (adriamycin-resistant k562)
cells. we also assessed the effect of 5-aza-29- xxxd1836xxx 
(dac), an inhibitor of dna methyltransferase, on mdr-1
gene expression in k562/adm cells. our data suggest that
mdr-1 gene expression is associated with methylation status
at the repressor binding site (-110 gc-box).

materials and methods
dac and sodium bisulfite were purchased from sigma chemical (st louis, mo, usa), isogen from nippon gene (tokyo,
japan) and antibody against  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  (uic2) for flow cytometric
analysis from coulter (tokyo, japan). all other chemicals were
obtained from standard sources. k562 and k562/adm cells
were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 u/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml) and 0.2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate in 5%
co2/95% humidified air. the cells were routinely passaged
with medium changes twice a week. k562/adm cells were
cultured in the presence of 300 ng/ml adriamycin for 3 days
every 2 weeks.

analysis of methylation status in promoter region of
mdr-1 gene
genomic dna was prepared from k562 or k562/adm cells
by using isogen solution according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. dna methylation patterns in the cpg island of
the mdr-1 gene promoter were determined by chemical
modification; unmethylated cytosines were changed to uracil
by sodium bisulfite treatment, while methylated cytosines
were not. two micrograms of dna were denatured with
naoh and modified by sodium bisulfite. dna was then purified using wizard dna purification resin (promega, lake placid, ny, usa), again treated with naoh, precipitated with
ethanol and resuspended in water. subsequently, pcr was
performed using the primer sets designed to amplify both the
methylated and the modified unmethylated dna sequence.
the primer pair for this reaction was 59-ggtgatata-

which amplified the region including the -110 gc and -50
gc-boxes. pcr products were purified using wizard pcr
purification resin, ligated into pgem-t easy vector (promega)
followed by a transformation protocol using dh5alpha as competent cells. after plasmid isolation, 20 clones were obtained
and subjected to sequence analysis with an abi automated
dna sequencer using a dye termination kit (abi, foster city,
ca, usa). based on these data, we made primer pairs for
methylation-specific pcr analysis (msp). primer sequences for
the -110 gc-box of mdr-1 were 59-tatttagttaatt
cgggtcg-39 (upper primer)/59-taaactcaaacttcctataac-39 (lower primer) for the methylated allele and 59tttagttaatttgggttggg-39 (upper)/59-taaactcaaa
cttcctataac-39 (lower) for the unmethylated allele. the
annealing temperature was 51°c. the expected pcr product
size was 125 bp. primers for the -50 gc-box were 59gttgggtaggaatagcgtc-39 (upper)/59-cctcaaaaaa

ttctcc-39 (lower) for the unmethylated allele. the annealing
temperature was 51°c. the predicted size of the amplified
product was 306 bp. the pcr products were visualized, after
2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, by ethidium bromide
staining.

at 42°c overnight in the presence of radiolabeled probes.
northern blots were washed twice with 2 × ssc containing
1.0% (w/v) sds at room temperature, and once with 0.2 ×
ssc containing 0.1% (w/v) sds. the dried filter was exposed
to kodak xar film at −80°c for 24 h and developed.

flow cytometric analysis of mdr-1 in k562/adm
cells treated with dac
k562/adm and k562 cells were treated with or without
5.0 µm dac for 4 days. dac was easily inactivated in the
culture medium, such that supplementation every 24 h was
required. the samples were then divided into two portions;
one for flow cytometric analysis and the other for northern
blot analysis. the flow cytometric procedure was as follows.
k562/adm and k562 cells were washed once with pbs and
resuspended in 200 µl of binding buffer (10 mm hepes, ph
7.4, 140 mm nacl, 2.5 mm cacl2). samples were then incubated with pe-conjugated uic2, anti- xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  antibody (coulter,
tokyo, japan) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.
after a brief centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 2000 µl
of binding buffer and subjected to flow cytometric analysis
using epics xl system ii (coulter).

northern blot analysis of mdr-1 in k562/adm cells
treated with dac
total cellular rnas were isolated from k562/adm and k562
cells, using isogen solutions. seven micrograms of total rna
was subjected to electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred on to hybond n+ nylon filters
(amersham life science technology, tokyo, japan) by capillary blotting in 20 × ssc (1 × ssc; 150 mm nacl, 12.5 mm
sodium citrate, ph 7.0). the filter was baked at 80°c for 3 h
and prehybridized at 42°c for 1 h in 50% formamide, 5 ×
denhardt’s, 5 × ssc, 0.1% sds and 100 µg/ml sheared salmon sperm dna. for probe preparation, a partial cdna for
human  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  was amplified by rt-pcr using template cdna
and oligonucleotide primers (59-gctcaaagaagcagaggccg-39 and 59-agctccccaacatcgtgcac-39). the
amplified products were purified using wizard pcr purifileukemia

k562/adm cells were treated with or without 5.0 µm dac for
4 days. whole-cell lysates were denatured by 3 min boiling,
fractionated on 8.0% sds-polyacrylamide gel and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. the blots were blocked with
50 mmol/l tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mmol/l nacl, 5% non-fat
milk and 0.3% tween 20 at room temperature for 30 min and
incubated in the same buffer containing anti-egr-1 antibody
at 4°c overnight. the immunoblots were visualized with an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (ecl; amersham life
science technology) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit antibody.

results

the -110 gc-box of the mdr-1 gene is methylated in
k562/adm, but not parental k562 cells
within the promoter region of the mdr-1 gene, we focused
on the -110 and -50 gc-boxes because the gc-box is widely
considered to be important in the tata-less promoter. upon
modification with sodium bisulfite, all cytosines should be
converted to uracil, whereas methylated cytosine (5methylcytosine) is resistant to this modification and remains
in the original state. taking advantage of this feature, we
obtained detailed information about the methylation status of
all 28 cpg sites within the amplified region including the
-110 gc-box and the -50 gc-box. figure 1 shows a representative sequence analysis of the -110 and -50 gc-boxes after
sodium bisulfite treatment of k562/adm cells. among 20
dna clones from k562/adm cells, four clones were methylation-positive at the both gc-boxes. in addition, all other cpg
sites in these same four clones were methylated. the rest of
16 clones were methylation-negative at all 28 cpg sites
including both gc-boxes. in contrast, in parental k562 cells,
two clones were methylation-positive and 18 were negative

each figure. cytosines which are methylated (asterisk) remain as cytosines after sodium bisulfite treatment (upper panel), while unmethylated
cytosines are converted to thymidines (lower panel). the experimental procedure is described in materials and methods.

at the -50 gc-box, while all of the subcloned samples (20/20)
were methylation-negative at the -110 gc-box (table 1).
these two clones, which were methylation-positive at -50
gc-box and methylation-negative at -110 gc-box, were
methylation-positive at all other cpg sites except at -263. figure
2 shows msp analysis of the -110 gc and -50 gc-boxes in
k562/adm, parental k562 and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. no methylation was detected at either the -50 or
the -110 gc-box in normal bone marrow cells. we therefore
defined ‘methylation-positive by msp’ as ‘hypermethylation’.
consistent with the results shown in table 1, the repressor binding site of the mdr-1 gene (-110 gc-box) was not methylated
in parental k562 cells, but was hypermethylated in k562/adm
cells. these data suggest that  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression may be related to
the methylation status of the -110 gc-box.

dac treatment suppresses  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression in
k562/adm cells
if hypermethylation at the -110 gc-box prohibits the binding of repressor molecules in k562/adm cells,  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx 
expression should be suppressed by treatment with dac,
an inhibitor of dna methyltransferase. we monitored
changes in  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression after dac treatment in
k562/adm cells. figure 3 shows flow cytometric analysis
results of k562/adm cells with and without 4 days of dac
treatment.  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression in these cells was clearly suppressed by dac treatment. northern blot analysis also
revealed mdr-1 expression to be suppressed after 4 days
of dac treatment. an approximately 65% decrease was
observed, by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram,

as compared with the control sample (figure 4a). we also
studied the time-course of mdr-1 expression in dactreated k562/adm cells. as shown in figure 4b, the suppression of mdr-1 by dac had already become apparent
at 8 h incubation, with an approximately 70% decrease by
densitometric scanning. we also confirmed demethylation
at the -50 and -110 gc-boxes after dac treatment in
k562/adm cells, employing a msp technique (figure 4c).

egr-1 expression is not changed by dac treatment in
k562/adm cells
egr-1 has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator in
mdr-1 gene regulation. as dac may suppress  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression
through down-regulation of egr-1, we studied egr-1
expression in k562/adm cells with or without dac treatment.
as shown in figure 5, expression of egr-1 did not change after
dac treatment of k562/adm cells (lanes 2 and 3).
discussion
multidrug resistance is often induced by repeated chemotherapy in patients with hematological malignancies. the
mdr-1 gene encodes  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx , one of the factors responsible for
the induction of multidrug resistance. however, mdr-1 gene
regulation is not yet fully understood. the gc-box has generally been thought to be a key factor in the tata-less promoter. in addition, dna methylation at the cpg island of the
promoter region is known to play an important role in regulating gene expression. de novo methylation has been
shown to be associated with transcriptional silencing of tumor
suppressor genes, including p15, p16 and rb, and is also
involved in x-chromosome inactivation and genomic
imprinting.13,18–22
gene expression is reportedly upregulated by dac treatment in many genes including p15, p16 and rb. in contrast,

another primer pair, which was used to amplify the region including 110 and -50 gc-boxes (material and methods), was also used for
demonstrating the amount of dna (lanes 5 and 6). this primer set
does not contain cpg sites, and thus, is free from dac effects. the
amounts of pcr-products representing the -50 gc-box and the -110
gc-box are both decreased in dac treatment, while the amount of
dna used was slightly greater in dac treatment in this particular
experiment.

figure 5
western blot analysis of egr-1 in k562/adm cells after
dac treatment. k562/adm cells were treated with or without dac
for 4 days. whole cell lysates were prepared from each samples.
then, western analysis was performed as described in materials and
methods (lane 1: parental k562 cells treated with 16 nm tpa for 16 h
(positive control); lane 2: k562/adm cells without dac treatment;
lane 3: k562/adm cells treated with dac for 4 days).

dac induced down-regulation of mdr-1 gene expression in
k562/adm cells. the different responses to dac can be
explained as follows. methylation status is reportedly related
to the expression of the genes including p15, p16 and rb. in
these genes, each transcript is down-regulated when hypermethylation occurs at the promoter region. therefore, the
expression of these genes is increased by dac treatment. in
the mdr-1 gene, however, the -110 gc-box is known to be
a transcriptional repressor binding site. the mdr-1 promoter
activity was shown to be increased six-fold when this site was
mutated.5 we herein demonstrated the -110 gc-box of the
mdr-1 gene to be methylated in k562/adm but not parental
k562 cells. therefore,  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  expression was down-regulated by
dac treatment in k562/adm cells, possibly due to demethylation at the repressor binding site.
the -50 gc-box is an activator-binding site in the mdr-1
gene promoter. transcriptional factors, including sp-1 and
egr-1, bind to the -50 gc-box. cytosine methylation
reportedly does not affect transcriptional factor sp-1 binding
to the human metallothionein iia promoter.23 as for egr-1,
mccoy et al reported this transcriptional factor to be necessary
for mdr-1 promoter activity in response to  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa) in k562, and that egr-1
effectively induced reporter gene activity through binding to
the mdr-1 promoter encompassing the sp-1/egr-1 site,
which corresponds to the -50 gc-box.6 however, dac treatment did not change egr-1 expression in k562/adm cells,
indicating that egr-1 levels are not involved in changes in
mdr-1 gene expression after dac treatment.
kantharidis et al24 reported that dac treatment increased
 xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  in a human t cell leukemia cell line. this is apparently
in conflict with our present results. gc-boxes are not always
a primary regulator for mdr-1 regulation. for example, nfil6 binding site was shown to be more important than gcboxes in mdr-1 regulation in htlv-1 infected cell lines.25
furthermore, fryxell et al26 described the methylation status
of the cpg-rich domain as not acting as a switch regulating
mdr-1 gene expression. intracellular levels of various transcriptional factors may vary in cells, which may explain these
conflicting results. although promoter region methylation
status may not be the only factor regulating mdr-1 gene
expression, the present results suggest that the methylation
status of the -110 gc-box, the repressor binding site, regulates
mdr-1 gene expression in k562/adm cells.
