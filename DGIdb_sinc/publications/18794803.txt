here, we identify a panel of melanoma lines with nonv600e mutations in braf. these g469e- and d594gmutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive
levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(perk) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated
protein kinase/erk kinase (pmek) and were resistant
to mek inhibition. upon treatment with the craf
inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and
associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the brafv600e-mutated melanomas did not. studies have shown
low-activity mutants of braf (g469e/d594g) instead
signal through craf. unlike braf, craf directly
regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization
where it binds to bcl-2 and phosphorylates bad. the
craf inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a timedependent reduction in both bad phosphorylation and
bcl-2 expression in the d594g/g469e lines only. knockdown of craf using a lentiviral shrna suppressed both
bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the d594g
melanoma line but not in a v600e-mutated line. finally,
we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib
was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the
d594g mutation than those with the v600e mutation. in
summary, we have identiﬁed a group of melanomas with
low-activity braf mutations that are reliant upon
craf-mediated survival activity.

introduction
the discovery of activating v600e braf mutations in
approximately 50% of melanomas has raised the
expectations for targeted therapy (davies et al., 2002;
houben et al., 2008). the main downstream target of
the braf v600e mutation is the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) pathway, and it is known that
high constitutive mapk activity accounts for the
increased proliferation rates, enhanced cell survival
and invasive behavior of melanomas (smalley, 2003;
gray-schopfer et al., 2007). as a result, the pharmacological targeting of braf/mapk signaling in melanoma is now being intensively studied in both the clinical
and preclinical settings (eisen et al., 2006).
there is now a growing realization that there are a
substantial group of melanomas (>33%) that do not
harbor braf v600e mutations that may require
alternate therapeutic strategies. one possible alternate
oncogene in melanoma is the closely related serinethreonine kinase craf (or  xxxg1924xxx ). like braf, craf
is also associated with the plasma membrane and can
activate mapk signaling (kyriakis et al., 1992).
however, unlike braf, craf also has other functions
independent of mapk signaling and is known to
regulate downstream effectors such as mst-2 and
ask-1 (chen et al., 2001; o’neill et al., 2004). another
intriguing aspect of craf signaling is its association
with the mitochondria, where it directly regulates
apoptosis independently of mapk signaling (wang
et al., 1996a, b). the anti-apoptotic effects of craf
arise through its direct binding to bcl-2 (wang et al.,
1996a), an interaction that leads to the phosphorylation
of bad (von gise et al., 2001; jin et al., 2005). although
melanomas are not known to harbor activating craf
mutations, it has been shown that melanomas harboring
mutations in  xxxg1605xxx  may signal through craf
(dumaz et al., 2006). recent studies have also shown
that braf can activate craf, through direct
protein–protein interaction and the phosphorylation of
craf by braf (dhomen and marais, 2007).
although most work to date has focused upon the
braf v600e mutation, at least 70 other low-frequency

braf mutations have been identiﬁed (wan et al., 2004).
unlike the braf v600e mutation, which can activate
mapk signaling directly, many of the other braf
mutations are of ‘low-activity’ and are only able to
weakly activate mapk signaling in isolated kinase
assays (wan et al., 2004). however, when these same
low-activity braf mutants are expressed in cos-1
cells, they induce high levels of constitutive mapk
activity: a process driven through the activation of
craf (wan et al., 2004).
in this study we identiﬁed a panel of melanoma cell
lines with three non-v600e braf mutations (k601e,
g469e and d594g). two of these (g469e and d594g)
are low-activity braf mutants and these cell lines are
highly resistant to treatment with a mitogen-activated
protein kinase/erk kinase (mek) inhibitor but highly
sensitive to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. sorafenib is a
kinase inhibitor that has undergone extensive clinical
evaluation in melanoma. although suggested to be a
braf inhibitor, sorafenib actually has a fourfold
higher selectivity for craf>braf, as well as
inhibitory effects against a number of other kinases
(wilhelm et al., 2004). here, we have shown that craf
inhibition using either sorafenib or a craf shrna
led to a mek-independent decrease in bcl-2 expression
and apoptosis. it is therefore likely that there exists a
group of melanomas with low-activity braf mutations
that may be highly sensitive to sorafenib-induced
apoptosis.

identiﬁcation of human melanomas with low-activity
braf mutations with sensitivity to sorafenib-induced
apoptosis
most studies to date have focused upon the role of the
braf v600e mutation in melanoma. in this study, we
proﬁled a total of 90 melanoma samples that were
mutationally screened for mutations in braf (exon 11
and 15),  xxxg1605xxx  and kit, in the order indicated in
supplementary figure 1. the most prevalent mutation
was the exon 15, braf v600e mutation (table 1). a
number of other v600 mutations, such as v600k and
v600r, were also identiﬁed, although at much lower
frequency. one patient was identiﬁed with a low-activity
exon 11, g469a braf mutation. the next most
signiﬁcant group of patients harbored mutations in
 xxxg1605xxx , with a limited number of patients harboring
mutations in kit (table 1). mutational proﬁling of our
melanoma cell line panel identiﬁed three cell lines with
non-v600e mutations in braf (table 2). of these cell
lines, one (wm3629) had the d594g braf mutation,
another (wm3670) had the g469e braf mutation and
one line (wm3130) had a k601e braf mutation.
western blot analysis revealed all three of the nonv600e braf mutant cell lines to have constitutive
levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(perk) (figure 1a). levels of perk were only serumdependent in the 1205lu and wm3629 cell lines

(supplementary figure 2). the braf v600e-mutated
and the k601e melanoma cell lines also had constitutive
phospho-mek (pmek), whereas this was lacking in the
cell lines with the d594g (wm3629) and g469e
(wm3670) braf mutation (figure 1a). all of the cell
lines tested had some degree of phospho-akt activity.
although the low-activity mutant melanoma cell lines
retained pten expression (figure 1a), the protein was
phosphorylated, indicating its inactivity.
previous studies have suggested that the presence of
the braf v600e mutation predicts response to mek
inhibition (solit et al., 2006). here, we show that the
d594g (wm3629) and the g469e (wm3670) melanoma cell lines are nearly completely resistant to the
growth inhibitory effects of the mek inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx 
(figure 1b). in contrast, the melanoma cell lines
harboring either the braf v600e or k601e mutation
were markedly growth-inhibited following  xxxd3462xxx  treatment (figure 1b). interestingly, the d594g mutated
melanoma line wm3629 was highly sensitive to growth
inhibition following treatment with the kinase inhibitor
sorafenib (figure 1c), whereas the cell lines with the
v600e, g469e and k601e braf mutations were
growth-inhibited, but not as highly sensitive.

sorafenib preferentially induces apoptosis in melanoma
cell lines with low-activity mutations in braf
sorafenib is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with
selectivity for craf over braf. treatment of
the melanoma cell line panel with sorafenib (3 mm,
24 h) led to a marked apoptosis in the cell lines with
the d549g and g469e braf mutations (figure 2a).
the two cell lines with the braf v600e mutation
(1205lu and 451lu) were found to undergo only a
g1-phase cell cycle arrest (figure 2a) and the cell line
with the k601e braf mutation underwent limited
apoptosis (o15%). treatment of three  xxxg1605xxx -mutated
melanoma cell lines (wm1361a, wm1366, wm1346)
with sorafenib (3 mm, 24 h) showed a g1-phase cell
cycle arrest but no apoptosis induction (not shown).
treatment of the v600e-, d594g-, g469e- and k601emutated melanoma lines with  xxxd3462xxx  (30 mm, 24 h)
did not lead to apoptosis induction, demonstrating
that the sorafenib-induced apoptosis was mek
independent (not shown). as craf is known to
regulate apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria, we
next looked at the ability of sorafenib in reducing
mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethyl
rhodamine methylester (tmrm). treatment of the
d594g- and g469e-mutated melanoma cell lines,
with sorafenib (3 mm, 8 h) led to 31 and 36% loss of
tmrm, respectively, compared with a tmrm loss of
10% in the braf v600e-mutated 1205lu cell line
(figure 2b). consistent with the increased tmrm
loss seen in the low-activity braf-mutated melanoma
cell lines, it was also shown that sorafenib (3 mm, 0–24 h)
induced a selective cleavage of caspase-3 in the
wm3629 and wm3670 cell lines (figure 2c and not
shown) and not the 1205lu cell line. pretreatment
of the wm3629 cells with z-vad-fmk (15–50 mm)
was not found to signiﬁcantly reduce the extent of
apoptosis induction, indicating that caspase cleavage
may have been a secondary effect of apoptosis
induction. although sorafenib was not pro-apoptotic
in the 1205lu cell line, it induced p53 expression
in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas
treatment of the wm3629 cell line with sorafenib did
not alter the expression of p53 (supplementary
figure 3a). interestingly, the upregulated p53 in the
1205lu cell line was not associated with increased p21
expression, demonstrating a lack of transcriptional
activity.
apoptosis arising following mitochondrial depolarization is also known to involve the release of
apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) from the mitochondria
and its relocalization to the nucleus. initial studies,
costaining the wm3629 cells with both mitotracker
orange and aif, showed that aif associated with
the mitochondria (supplementary figure 3b). it was
further found that treatment of the wm3629 and
wm3670 cells with sorafenib (3 and 10 mm, 24 h)
but not  xxxd3462xxx  (30 mm, 24 h) led to the nuclear
localization of aif (figure 3). at the same time,
sorafenib treatment also led to the loss of mitotracker
orange staining, demonstrating loss of mitochondrial
integrity.

induces caspase-3 cleavage in d594g-mutated melanoma cells. melanoma cells were treated with sorafenib (3 mm, 0–24 h), followed by
protein extraction and probing for cleavage of caspase-3. equal protein loading is shown by stripping of the blot and probing for actin
expression.

sorafenib induces apoptosis by modulating bcl-2
expression in a mek-independent manner
having shown that sorafenib-induced apoptosis was
independent of mek inhibition, we next turned our
attention to the mechanism of sorafenib-induced apoptosis in the d594g- and g469e-mutated melanoma cell
lines. we ﬁrst examined the relative selectivity of
sorafenib to block perk activity in the v600e- and
d594g-mutated melanoma cell lines. sorafenib completely blocked perk activity of the d594g-mutated
cell line wm3629 at o100 nm, whereas little effect was
seen in the 1205lu cell line until 3 mm of sorafenib
(figure 4a). as this possibly indicated that sorafenib
was having a craf-speciﬁc effect in the wm3629 cell
line, we next tested the ability of the mek inhibitor
oncogene

 xxxd3462xxx  to inhibit perk in the two cell lines and found
that  xxxd3462xxx  had equivalent activity in inhibiting perk
in the wm3629 and 1205lu cell lines (figure 4b),
suggesting that the selective effects of sorafenib upon the
wm3629 cell line were likely to be craf mediated.
craf is known to suppress apoptosis through a
direct association with bcl-2. cellular fractionation
studies showed craf to be associated with the
mitochondria in both the wm3670 and wm3629 cell
lines (supplementary figure 4). sorafenib treatment led
to a time-dependent (o8 h) downregulation in both
bcl-2 and phospho-bad expression in the two cell lines
with the d594g and g469e braf mutations, but not
those with either the v600e or k601e braf mutation
(figures 4b and c and data not shown). in contrast,

89

the effects of sorafenib were mek independent (figures
4b and c). sorafenib treatment was also found to
downregulate expression of  xxxg1388xxx  (supplementary
figure 5). the effects of sorafenib upon  xxxg1388xxx  expression were likely to be independent of braf mutational
status, as similar effects were observed in both the
1205lu and wm3629 cell lines.

figure 3 sorafenib but not  xxxd3462xxx  leads to the nuclear relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor (aif). wm3629 and wm3670
cells were treated with either vehicle (control), sorafenib (3 mm,
24 h) or  xxxd3462xxx  (30 mm, 24 h) before being ﬁxed, permeabilized and

figure 4 sorafenib decreases bcl-2 and pbad expression in lowactivity braf mutant melanoma cells in a mek-independent
manner. (a) sorafenib potently inhibits perk activity in the
d594g braf-mutated cells. 1205lu (v600e)- and wm3629
(d594g)-mutated melanoma cells were treated with either sorafenib (0.1–3 mm, 1 h) or  xxxd3462xxx  (0.3–10 mm, 1 h) before being
extracted, resolved and probed for either perk (perk) or total
erk (terk). (b) sorafenib reduces bcl-2 expression in the
d549g- and g469e-mutated melanoma lines in a mek-independent manner. cells were treated with either sorafenib (3 mm, 0–24 h)
or  xxxd3462xxx  (30 mm, 0–24 h) after which time protein was extracted,
resolved and probed for expression of bcl-2. blots were stripped
and probed for actin to demonstrate equal protein loading. (c)
sorafenib selectively downregulates bad activity in the d594gand g469e-mutated melanoma cell line in a mek-independent
manner. cells were treated with drug as in (b), and resulting protein
extracts were probed for expression of ser75 pbad (pbad) and
total bad (tbad). blots were stripped and probed for actin to
demonstrate equal protein loading.

craf shrna knockdown reduces mapk signaling and
induces apoptosis in a low-activity braf-mutated
melanoma cell line
we next looked at the prosurvival role of craf
signaling in the wm3629 cell line. infection with an
shrna targeted against craf led to protein knockdown (figure 5a). the shrna construct that gave the
best level of craf knockdown (clone no. 3) was found
to inhibit perk in the wm3629 cell line, but not the
1205lu cells, suggesting that erk activation is
mediated, in part, through craf. knockdown of
craf using shrna clone 3 was also shown to reduce
the expression of bcl-2 and pbad in the wm3629 cell
lines, but not the 1205lu cell line (figure 5a). the
downregulation of craf expression was also found to
induce apoptosis in the wm3629 cell lines, but not the
1205lu cell line, as characterized by the appearance of a
sub-g1 peak (24% apoptotic cells) (figure 5b) and
increased tdt-mediated dntp nick end labeling staining (figure 5c). as further demonstration of the
essential role of craf in the survival of this subgroup
of melanoma cells, we showed that shrna knockdown
of craf led to a marked suppression of tumor-forming
ability in vivo (figure 5d). in a ﬁnal series of studies, we
demonstrated that the shrna knockdown of bcl-2
increased apoptosis in the wm3629 cell line (supplementary figure 6a–c), demonstrating the importance
of bcl-2 expression in maintaining the survival of
melanoma cell lines with the d549g braf mutation.
sorafenib induces some regression of d594g
braf-mutated melanoma xenografts, but only slowing
of braf v600e-mutated melanoma xenografts
we next grew both the wm3629 and 1205lu cells as
tumor xenografts in severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(scid) mice, to assess whether sorafenib had any selective
effects upon the d594g-mutated wm3629 cell line. after
tumor establishment (5  5 mm), mice were dosed three
times per week with either vehicle or sorafenib tosylate
(60 mg/kg) by oral gavage. after 14 days, it was found
that sorafenib treatment had suppressed growth of the
wm3629 cell line (figure 6a), leading to some degree of
regression. in contrast, although sorafenib treatment
reduced the growth of the v600e-mutated 1205lu
melanoma xenograft, these tumors continued to grow in
the presence of drug (figure 6b).

discussion
treatment of the cells with  xxxd3462xxx  (30 mm) was not found
to reduce bcl-2 or phospho-bad expression in the
wm3629 and wm3670 cell lines, again suggesting that

figure 5 low-activity braf mutant melanoma cells depend upon craf for mek activity and bcl-2-mediated cell survival. (a)
knockdown of craf reduces the perk activity in d594g- and g469e braf-mutated melanoma cells. cells with the braf v600e
(1205lu) or d594g (wm3629) mutation were infected with either a control lentiviral shrna (c) or one of two clones directed against
craf (no. 1 or no. 3). following drug selection, cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted and probed for expression of perk
(perk), total erk (erk), bcl-2 (bcl-2) and phoshpo-bad (pbad). even protein loading was conﬁrmed following the stripping of
the blots and probing for expression of actin. (b) after lentiviral infection and drug selection, cells were harvested, stained with
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide and analysed by ﬂow cytometry. the number of sub-g1 cells is indicative of apoptosis. (c) tdt-mediated dntp nick
end labeling staining of melanoma cells infected with either shrna control (left panel) or clone no. 3 of the craf shrna. (d) craf
knockdown reduces the tumorigenicity of wm3629 cells. wm3629 cells were infected with shrna control, clone no. 1, clone no. 3 of
the craf shrna. a total of 2 million cells were then injected into the lower back of severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice. tumor
volumes were measured every week over a 6-week period. **statistically signiﬁcantly different from tumor volume in control wm3629

remains a very large group of melanomas (>33%) of
which very little is known. this study has identiﬁed a
group of melanomas with low-activity non-v600e
mutations in braf, a reliance on craf signaling
and sensitivity to the pro-apoptotic effects of sorafenib/
craf knockdown. in agreement with all published
studies to date, most of the mutations in braf
identiﬁed in our patient population (>95%) were exon
15 mutations at the v600e position (davies et al., 2002).
oncogene

only one exon 11 mutation, the g469a, was identiﬁed
in our clinical specimens, suggesting that these mutations are relatively rare. in contrast, analysis of our cell
lines identiﬁed two exon 11 mutations, the d594g and
g469e. the apparent lack of d594g mutations in our
clinical population is likely a result of the relatively
small sample size in this study.
previous biochemical analysis of the braf d594gand g469e-isolated kinase assays showed them to be

‘low-activity mutants’ with impaired erk activation
(wan et al., 2004; garnett et al., 2005). relative to
braf v600e, which was assigned a kinase activity
score of 478, the d594g and g469e mutants were
found to have kinase activities of 0.6 and 1.8,
respectively (wan et al., 2004). however, when these
mutants were expressed in cos-1 cells, they were found
to activate erk, through a mechanism involving the
transactivation of craf (wan et al., 2004). the other
braf mutant identiﬁed, k601e, is suggested to be an
intermediate activity mutant with a kinase activity score
of 138 (wan et al., 2004); unlike the low-activity
mutants, the k601e is not thought to require craf
for its mek activity.
the two cell lines with low-activity braf mutations
were found to have constitutive perk activity, but very
low pmek activity. although the presence of constitutive perk in the low-activity braf mutant melanoma
cell lines was predicted by previous studies using cos-1
cells, the relative lack of pmek activity is unexpected
(wan et al., 2004). in addition to having very low mek
activity, the d594g- and g469e-mutated melanoma
lines were also highly resistant to the mek inhibitor

 xxxd3462xxx . these results agree with previous studies
suggesting that the presence of the braf v600e
mutation is predictive of response to mek inhibition
(solit et al., 2006; haass et al., 2008). interestingly, it
was found that the lowest activity braf mutant
(d594g) was sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor
sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx , nexxavar). treatment of the
low-activity mutant cell lines with sorafenib led to
profound levels of apoptosis. in contrast, no apoptosis
was seen in either of the braf v600e-mutated cell
lines, and only limited apoptosis was seen in the k601e
braf-mutated cell line. although sorafenib can inhibit
mek activity, the pro-apoptotic activity observed was
found to be mek independent, as  xxxd3462xxx  treatment did
not induce apoptosis in any of the cell lines tested. these
ﬁndings agree with our previous studies, also showing
very limited mek inhibitor-induced apoptosis across a
large panel of melanoma cell lines (smalley et al., 2006;
haass et al., 2008). one unexpected ﬁnding was the
ability of sorafenib to induce p53 expression in the
1205lu cell line in the absence of any apoptosis
induction or upregulation of p21 expression. this is
likely to be a consequence of the high expression of
murine double minute-2 (mdm2), a key negative
regulator of p53 activity, in these melanoma cell lines.
previous work from our group has shown that p53dependent apoptosis proceeds efﬁciently only when
mdm2 expression is suppressed (smalley et al., 2007a).
although sorafenib inhibits the activity of a number
of kinases, its highest afﬁnity is actually against craf
(wilhelm et al., 2004). craf is known to suppress
apoptosis through a direct association with the mitochondria. in agreement with the idea of the sorafenib
effects being craf mediated, we found that there was a
preferential loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
only in the melanoma cells with low-activity braf
mutations. sorafenib-induced apoptosis has also been
associated with the loss of mitochondrial aif and its
relocalization to the nucleus (panka et al., 2006). the
ﬁnding that sorafenib, but not  xxxd3462xxx  treatment, led to
the loss of mitochondrial aif expression provides
further evidence that the effects of this inhibitor are
mek independent. although the low-activity mutant
melanoma cell lines have low mek activity, both
sorafenib and  xxxd3462xxx  were able to block perk activity
in these cells. the fact that sorafenib blocked all perk
activity in the d594g cell line at a 10-fold lower
concentration than in the v600e-mutated melanoma
cell line again suggested that the preferential effects of
sorafenib in the low-activity mutants was a consequence
of craf inhibition. this idea was conﬁrmed by
shrna knockdown of craf, which led to an
inhibition of perk activity in the d594g/g469e lines
and not in the v600e-mutated cells. again, like
sorafenib, craf knockdown also selectively induced
apoptosis in the low-activity mutant melanoma cells,
conﬁrming the role of craf in the survival of
melanomas with low-activity braf mutations.
craf is known to associate with both the plasma
membrane and the mitochondrial membrane (rapp
et al., 2004). only the plasma membrane-associated

craf activates the map kinase pathway with the
mitochondria-associated craf instead regulating
apoptosis through direct association with the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 (wang et al., 1996a). the lack
of pro-apoptotic activity in our melanoma cell lines
following mek inhibition suggests that the proapoptotic activity seen in the low-activity braf mutant
following sorafenib treatment is likely to be mek
independent.
bcl-2 is a bh3 family domain protein that occupies a
convergent site in the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis
pathways. it protects cells by maintaining mitochondrial
integrity, thereby suppressing the release of the proapoptotic proteins cytochrome-c and aif. the activity
of bcl-2 is regulated through a dynamic balance between
the number of pro- and anti-apoptotic complexes
formed, with craf forming an anti-apoptotic complex
with bcl-2 and bad forming a pro-apoptotic complex
with bcl-2 (zha et al., 1996; wang et al., 1996a). craf
is targeted to the mitochondria following its ser 338
and 339 phosphorylation by p21-activated kinase-1 (jin
et al., 2005). once associated with the mitochondria,
craf binds directly to bcl-2 and displaces bad by
phosphorylating it at ser75 (jin et al., 2005). the
replacement of bad with craf within the bcl-2
complex serves to alter the life/death balance of the cell
and survival ensues. this study shows that melanoma
cell lines with d594g and g469e braf mutants
depend on craf for their survival. inhibition of
craf activity through either sorafenib or craf
shrna treatment leads to a rapid decrease in both
bcl-2 expression and bad phosphorylation, leading to
apoptosis. the wealth of evidence presented in this
study suggests that the anti-apoptotic activity of craf
in these cell lines is independent of mek activity and
is instead mostly a bcl-2-mediated effect upon cell
survival. treatment of d594g/g469e-mutated cells
with sorafenib leads to both loss of mitochondrial
integrity (as shown by decreased tmrm staining) and
the mitochondrial release of aif. furthermore, sorafenib decreases only bcl-2 and bad phosphorylation in
the d594g/g469e-mutated cell lines, which are known
to signal through craf, and not those with either the
k601e or the v600e braf mutations. although
 xxxg1605xxx -mutated melanomas are also known to signal
through craf (dumaz et al., 2006), we did not observe
similar sorafenib-mediated effects in cell lines with
 xxxg1605xxx  mutations, suggesting there may be other
survival mechanisms within this particular genetic
subgroup.
in summary, we have identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time a
subgroup of melanomas with low-activity mutants in
braf that instead rely on craf signaling for their
survival. striking responses were seen in these melanoma lines to sorafenib, now an fda-approved drug for
renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma. previously
conducted single-agent and chemotherapy-combination
trials with sorafenib in melanoma have included patients
regardless of the braf mutation status of their tumors.
among the subset of patients who received beneﬁt from
sorafenib, our data support analysis of these patients’
oncogene

tumors for the presence of low-activity braf mutations. we believe that there is a clear rationale for the
further clinical testing of this compound in melanoma
with a new focus on those melanomas with craf
dependency.

materials and methods
cell culture
human melanoma cells were isolated and cultured as
described by smalley et al. (2005). the lentiviral vector
shrna constructs for bcl-2, craf and scrambled controls
were from sigma (st louis, mo, usa). lentirviral infections
were performed as described previously (smalley et al., 2005).
tdt-mediated dntp nick end labeling staining was performed
as described previously (smalley et al., 2007a).
adherent cell proliferation analysis
cells were plated into a 96-well plate at a density of 2.5  104
cells per ml and left to grow overnight. cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of  xxxd3462xxx  (calbiochem, ca, usa)
or sorafenib (bayer corporation, wayne, nj, usa) in
triplicate; after 72 h, the levels of growth inhibition were
examined using the mtt assay (smalley et al., 2007b). data
show the mean of at least three independent experiments±
the s.e.m.
western blot analysis
proteins were extracted and blotted as described by smalley
et al. (2005). in some studies, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic
cellular fractions were prepared using a fractiontionation kit
(calbiochem). after analysis, western blots were stripped once
and reprobed for b-actin to demonstrate even protein loading.
antibodies to perk, total erk, pmek, phospho-pten,
total pten, caspase-3, phospho-bad, phospho-akt and
total akt were obtained from cell signaling technology
(beverly, ma, usa), and the antibodies to aif, craf and
bcl-2 were obtained from santa cruz (santa cruz, ca, usa).
in vivo melanoma xenograft studies
the study protocol was approved by the wistar institute
animal care and use committee. each group consisted of ﬁve
scid cb-17 mice (charles river laboratories, wilmington,
ma, usa). ten mice were injected subcutaneously with either
wm3629 or 1205lu cells (2  106) in matrigel into the lower
back. when animals had developed melanoma nodules of
about 5 mm in diameter, the study drug administration was
initiated (day 1): the scid mice were randomly assigned to the
two experimental groups of ﬁve animals each—(1) 200 ml
vehicle (cremophor el (12.5%)/ xxxd102xxx  (12.5%)/distilled water (75%)), (2) 60 mg/kg sorafenib tosylate (in 200 ml
vehicle) three times per week by oral gavage over a period of 14
days. tumors were measured twice a week using digital
calipers. tumor volume was calculated as a product of the
three dimensions. tumor shrinkage was calculated as a foldchange relative to the starting volume. at treatment day 14,
one hour after the ﬁnal drug application, all animals were
euthanized. in other studies, mice (6 per group) were injected
with wm3629 cells (2  106) in matrigel into the lower back
infected with either scrambled shrna control or clone1/3 of
the craf shrna. animals were then monitored for
melanoma growth over a 6-week period with tumor measurements being made once per week.

cell cycle analysis
cells were plated into 10-cm dishes at 60% conﬂuency and left
to grow overnight before being treated with sorafenib (3 or
10 mm) or  xxxd3462xxx  (10 or 30 mm) for 24 h. cells were ﬁxed in
70% ethanol overnight, labeled with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide and
analysed by ﬂow cytometry.
flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential
(dcm)
after the treatment of the cells with sorafenib (3 mm, 24 h), cells
were washed once with binding buffer (10 mm hepes
(ph 7.4), 140 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2) and resuspended in
100 ml binding buffer containing 25 nm tmrm perchlorate
(molecular probes, eugene, or, usa) and incubated at 37 1c
for 15 min. cells were then analysed for tmrm retention (red
ﬂuorescence) using ﬂow cytometry.
immunofluorescence microscopy
cells were seeded thinly onto  xxxd102xxx sterilized glass coverslips
in 6-well plates and left to grow overnight, after which they
were treated with either sorafenib (3 mm) or  xxxd3462xxx  (30 mm) for
24 h before being ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with 0.2% v/v triton x-100. one hour before
ﬁxation, cells were treated with mitotracker orange (molecular
probes) for 30 min. samples were then blocked in pbs
containing 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx . primary antibody
incubations to aif, (santa cruz) were performed at 37 1c

for 1 h under humidiﬁed conditions. slides were prepared as
described by smalley et al. (2005).
mutational testing
the algorithm for genotyping for ffpe melanoma specimens
is shown in supplementary figure 1. exons 15 of braf and 3
of  xxxg1605xxx  were typed concurrently using either pyrosequencing
or direct sequencing as described previously (spittle et al.,
2007). if these exons were wild type, the following exons are
typed in order, until a mutation is identiﬁed or all are wild
type—exon 11 of braf, exon 2 of  xxxg1605xxx  and kit (exons 9,
11, 13, 17). samples were collected from 160 unselected
melanomas from patients on clinical trials in full accordance
with the institutional review board of the university of
pennsylvania in compliance with hippa protocols. all
melanomas were superﬁcial spreading or nodular types.
statistical analysis
unless otherwise stated, all experiments show the mean±
s.e.m. of at least three independent experiments. statistical
signiﬁcance was measured using the student’s t-test, where
po0.05 was judged to be signiﬁcant.
