abstract
purpose: neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that continues to exact significant morbidity and mortality.
recently, a number of cell-cycle proteins, particularly those within the cyclin d/ xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx /rb network,
have been shown to exert oncogenic roles in neuroblastoma, suggesting that their therapeutic exploitation
might improve patient outcomes.
experimental procedures: we evaluated the effect of dual  xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx  inhibition on neuroblastoma
viability using  xxxd3112xxx  (novartis oncology), a highly specific  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibitor.
results: treatment with  xxxd3112xxx  significantly reduced proliferation in 12 of 17 human neuroblastomaderived cell lines by inducing cytostasis at nanomolar concentrations (mean ic50 ¼ 307  68 nmol/l in
sensitive lines).  xxxd3112xxx  caused cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence that was attributed to dosedependent decreases in phosphorylated rb and foxm1, respectively. in addition, responsiveness of
neuroblastoma xenografts to  xxxd3112xxx  translated to the in vivo setting in that there was a direct correlation
of in vitro ic50 values with degree of subcutaneous xenograft growth delay. although our data indicate
that neuroblastomas sensitive to  xxxd3112xxx  were more likely to contain genomic amplification of  xxxg1488xxx 
(p ¼ 0.01), the identification of additional clinically accessible biomarkers is of high importance.
conclusions: taken together, our data show that  xxxd3112xxx  is active in a large subset of neuroblastoma cell
line and xenograft models, and supports the clinical development of this  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibitor as a therapy for
patients with this disease. clin cancer res; 19(22); 6173–82. 2013 aacr.

introduction
neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that originates in
tissues of the developing sympathetic nervous system. it is
typically diagnosed in very young children and has a highly
variable clinical presentation, with tumors displaying significant genomic and biological heterogeneity (1–3).
although patients with favorable clinical and biological
features (low-risk disease) can often be cured by surgery
alone, patients with high-risk disease, particularly those
harboring amplification of the  xxxg1488xxx  oncogene, have survival rates of less than 40% despite intensive multimodal

therapy (1, 4). such high mortality thus mandates a need for
the development of novel therapies that will significantly
improve high-risk patient survival.
the identification of molecular abnormalities driving
neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and disease progression followed by their targeted treatment is a pragmatic strategy for
meeting this need. currently, converging evidence points
to members of the cyclin d/ xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx /rb cell-cycle
regulatory pathway as potential candidates for such therapeutic exploitation. both  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx  ( xxxg411xxx /6)
encode cyclin-dependent serine–threonine kinases that, in
response to mitogenic or pro-proliferative stimuli, complex
with d-type cyclins to phosphorylate the rb tumor suppressor protein. this phosphorylation induces the release of
rb from e2f transcription factors, and thus enables e2f to
transcribe the genes that are required for g1–s phase cellcycle progression and ultimately cellular proliferation (5–
7). in addition to cell-cycle regulation,  xxxg411xxx /6 signaling
has also been linked to senescence suppression via regulation of the foxm1 transcription factor (8). given its demonstrated ability to override suppressive cues in favor of
cellular proliferation, it is not surprising that deregulation
of the cyclin d/ xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx /rb pathway is associated with
unrestricted growth and is a hallmark of nearly every tumor
histotype.

translational relevance
neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that continues to
exact significant morbidity and mortality. we and others
have shown that the cyclin d/ xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx /rb pathway
is hyperactive in neuroblastoma, suggesting that this
cancer might be particularly vulnerable to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition. in an effort to translate this finding to the clinic,
we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo response of neuroblastoma to  xxxd3112xxx  (novartis oncology), a small molecule inhibitor targeting  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx . we show that
a majority of neuroblastoma models are indeed sensitive
to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition, with sensitivity attributed to an
induction of cytostasis (g1 arrest) and cellular senescence. our data therefore strongly support the integration of  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibitors into current treatment
regimens for neuroblastoma, and have provided a rationale for initiating a phase i clinical trial in this disease
(nct01747876).

with respect to neuroblastoma, we and others have
identified several genetic aberrations that increase  xxxg411xxx /
6 kinase activity. genomic amplification of  xxxg366xxx  (cyclin
d1) and  xxxg411xxx , as well as homozygous deletion of
 xxxg421xxx , have been reported in a subset of neuroblastomas
(9–14). in addition,  xxxg366xxx ,  xxxg411xxx , and  xxxg414xxx  have not
only been shown to be overexpressed in almost all cases of
neuroblastoma, but also their expression was found to be
higher in neuroblastoma in comparison to other tumors
(15). more recently, a synthetic lethality screen of the
protein kinome identified  xxxg411xxx  as a potential candidate
for therapeutic targeting in neuroblastoma (16). taken
together, these findings suggest a dependency on  xxxg411xxx /6
activity for neuroblastoma survival, and thus highlight their
potential as molecular targets for pharmacologic inhibition.
 xxxd3112xxx  (novartis oncology) is an orally bioavailable,
small molecule inhibitor of both  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx . here,
we report on the preclinical evaluation of  xxxd3112xxx  as a
neuroblastoma therapy. our results show that a subset of
neuroblastomas are highly sensitive to  xxxd3112xxx , and therefore support the clinical development of  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition
strategies in this disease.

materials and methods
cell lines and patient samples
all cell lines were obtained from the children’s hospital
of philadelphia cell line bank and were cultured in rpmi1640 media containing 10% fbs, 1% l-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin at 37 c and 5% co2. annual
genotyping (ampfistr identifier kit) of these lines and
a single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) array analysis
(illumina h550) were performed to ensure maintenance
of cell identity using methods as previously described
(17). all annotated but de-identified patient tumor samples were obtained from the children’s oncology group

6174

clin cancer res; 19(22) november 15, 2013

neuroblastoma biorepository. the illumina h550 snp
arrays were used to determine dna copy number status
of 375 high-risk primary neuroblastoma tumors, and gene
expression profiling of 251 tumors (30 low-risk, 221 highrisk) was performed using affymetrix human exon 1.0 st
microarrays.
tissue microarray
a neuroblastoma tissue microarray of duplicate paraffinembedded tumor cores from 106 diagnostic patients, as
well as control tissues, was used for this study (18). using
the bond refine polymer staining kit (leica microsystems), slides from each tumor core were stained with an
antibody against endogenous rb (cell signaling #9309,
1:300 dilution). antigen retrieval was performed with e2
retrieval solution (leica microsystems), and developed
slides were imaged at 20 magnification on an aperio os
slide scanner (aperio technologies). positive staining was
described by staining intensity (negative, weak, moderate,
or strong), and a staining score was also calculated as the
product of staining intensity and the percentage of neuroblasts stained.
western blotting
approximately 40 mg of cell line or patient tumor lysate
was prepared as previously described (19), separated by
electrophoresis on 4% to 12% polyacrylamide gels (lonza),
transferred to pvdf membranes (millipore), and probed
with primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions: rb,
1:2,000; prbs780, 1:2,000; prbs795, 1:2,000; prbs807/811,
1:2,000;  xxxg366xxx , 1:1,000;  xxxg368xxx , 1:1,000;  xxxg1488xxx ,
1:1,000; foxm1, 1:1,000 (cell signaling);  xxxg411xxx , 1:2,000;
 xxxg414xxx , 1:3,000; and b-actin, 1:3,000 (santa cruz). all
blots were quantified with imagej (national institutes of
health).
rna interference
cell lines were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates, and
knockdown of  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx  was performed 24 hours
later via combined transfection with 25 nmol/l on-target smartpool sirna targeting  xxxg411xxx  and 25 nmol/l
on-target smartpool sirna targeting  xxxg414xxx  (thermo
scientific). cell lines were also transfected with sirnas
directed against plk1 as well as nontargeting oligonucleotides (ntc), representing positive and negative controls,
respectively. cell viability was assayed 72 hours posttransfection using cell titer glo (promega). gene knockdown
was confirmed to be >85% at this time point by quantitative
real-time pcr, and protein-level knockdown was confirmed
by western blot.
pharmacologic growth inhibition
 xxxd3112xxx  was provided by novartis pharmaceuticals. a
panel of neuroblastoma cell lines, selected based upon
prior demonstration of substrate adherent growth, was
plated in triplicate on the xcelligence real-time cell electronic sensing system (acea biosciences) and treated 24
hours later with a four-log dose range of inhibitor or with a

 xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition in neuroblastoma

 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) control. cell indexes were
monitored continuously for 100 hours, and ic50 values
were determined as follows: growth curves were generated
by plotting the cell index as a function of time and were
normalized to the cell index at the time of treatment for a
baseline cell index of 1. the area under the normalized
growth curve from the time of treatment to 96 hours
posttreatment was then calculated using a baseline area of
1 (the cell index at the time of treatment). areas were
normalized to the dmso control, and the resulting data
were analyzed using a nonlinear log inhibitor versus normalized response function (graphpad prism). all experiments were repeated at least once.
cell-cycle analysis
cell lines were plated in duplicate in 35 mm plates and
treated 24 hours later with the indicated concentrations of
 xxxd3112xxx  or with a dmso control. at 96 hours posttreatment,
cells were gently harvested and fixed overnight in 70%
ethanol. cells were then washed in pbs, stained with 1
mg/ml fxviolet stain (invitrogen), and assayed for dna
content on an attune acoustic focusing cytometer (invitrogen). analysis was carried out using venturione software
(applied cytometry).
senescence and apoptosis assays
cellular senescence was assayed via measurement of
senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity (sa-b-gal).
cells were grown for 24 hours in 35 mm plates, treated
with 500 nmol/l  xxxd3112xxx  for 6 days, and then fixed and
stained overnight according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(cell signaling #9860). cells were then imaged for sa-b-gal
using an axio observer d.1 phase contrast microscope
(zeiss). the percentage of sa-b-gal positive cells was determined by counting the number of positive cells present in 3
separate microscope frames, and then normalizing to the
control. to assess apoptotic activity, cells were plated in
triplicate in 96-well plates, treated with  xxxd3112xxx , and
assayed for  xxxg341xxx /7 activation 16 hours after treatment
with caspase-glo 3/7 (promega). cells treated with sn-38
were used as a positive control (20).
xenograft therapeutic trials
the be2c, nb-1643, or ebc1 cell line–derived xenografts
were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of cb17
scid/ mice. animals bearing engrafted tumors of 200 to
600 mm3 were then randomized to oral treatment with 200
mg/kg  xxxd3112xxx  in 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx  (n ¼ 10) or vehicle
(n ¼ 10) daily for a total of 21 days. tumor burden was
determined periodically throughout treatment according to
the formula (p/6)  d2, where d represents the mean tumor
diameter obtained by caliper measurement. in accordance
with the children’s hospital of philadelphia institutional
animal care and use committee, animals were euthanized
as soon as tumor volume exceeded 3 cm3. a linear mixed
effects model was used to analyze differences in the rate of
tumor growth between the  xxxd3112xxx  and vehicle-treated
groups.

immunohistochemistry of xenografted
neuroblastomas
prbs807/811 (cell signaling) or ki67 (abcam #16667)
antibodies were used to stain slides of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumor that had been excised from mice
following 7 days of treatment with vehicle or  xxxd3112xxx .
staining for prbs807/811 was performed in accordance with
the manufacturer’s protocol (cell signaling) using a 1:200
dilution of primary antibody followed by a 1:500 dilution
of anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g (igg) secondary antibody
(abcam # 6721). slides pretreated with alkaline-phosphatase (new england biolabs) were used to confirm specificity
of phosphorylation detection. for ki67 staining, slides were
incubated in a pressure cooker (biocare medical) with
antigen unmasking solution (vector labs h3300), blocked
with 2% fbs and endogenous biotin (vector labs sp2001),
and stained at a 1:400 dilution of primary antibody for 1
hour and a 1:200 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit igg
secondary antibody (vector labs) for 30 minutes. slides
were then developed via incubation with abc (vector labs)
for 30 minutes followed by dab (dako cytomation) for
10 minutes. all slides were counterstained with harris
hematoxylin (fisher scientific), dehydrated, mounted, and
imaged at 20 magnification with an aperio os slide
scanner (aperio technologies).

results
 xxxg411xxx /6 signaling is hyperactive in neuroblastoma
copy number gain and overexpression of  xxxg411xxx ,  xxxg414xxx ,
and  xxxg366xxx  have been reported in many neuroblastoma
cell lines (refs. 10–15; supplementary table s1). to confirm
that these genomic aberrations translate to constitutive
 xxxg411xxx /6 signaling within the cyclin d/ xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx /rb
pathway, we examined the activation status of rb in a
comprehensive panel of highly characterized human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. as shown in fig. 1a, robust
phosphorylation of rb at serines 780 and 807/811—residues directly targeted by  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx  (21–23)—was
observed in all neuroblastoma cell lines, and protein-level
expression of  xxxg411xxx ,  xxxg414xxx , and  xxxg366xxx  occurred in the
majority of lines. comparatively, rb phosphorylation
together with protein-level expression of  xxxg411xxx ,  xxxg414xxx , and
 xxxg366xxx  was substantially lower in several other representative tumor types as well as in immortalized, nontransformed retinal pigmented epithelial (rpe1) cells (fig. 1b).
thus, it seems that in neuroblastoma cell lines, aberrant
overexpression of  xxxg411xxx ,  xxxg414xxx , and  xxxg366xxx  does indeed
facilitate hyperactive  xxxg411xxx /6 signaling within the cyclin
d/ xxxg411xxx / xxxg414xxx /rb network.
we next analyzed several neuroblastoma patient samples
to verify that the pathway activation observed in neuroblastoma cell lines is also a characteristic of patient tumors at
diagnosis and is not simply an artifact of the in vitro setting.
we found that  xxxg411xxx  mrna was highly expressed in highrisk patients in comparison to low-risk patients, and we
observed copy number gain of  xxxg411xxx  (5.1%),  xxxg414xxx 
(15.7%), and  xxxg366xxx  (19.5%) in a cohort of 375 high-risk

a significant increase in rb staining intensity, however, was
observed in high-risk,  xxxg1488xxx  amplified samples (p ¼ 0.03;

diagnostic tumor samples confirmed the expression of

with depletion of prbs780 beginning at 250 nmol/l.

effect of dual  xxxg411xxx /6 depletion on neuroblastoma cell
lines. targeted depletion of  xxxg411xxx /6 by sirna resulted in
differential decreases in cell viability, where some lines
responded robustly to  xxxg411xxx /6 depletion whereas little to
no effect was observed in other lines (fig. 2a). this phenotypic stratification of cell lines into  xxxg411xxx /6 "sensitive" or
"resistant" was not due to knockdown efficiency, as we
achieved significant knockdown of  xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx  mrna
and protein in all cell lines (fig. 2b). sensitive cell lines,
however, were more likely to harbor amplification of  xxxg1488xxx 
(p ¼ 0.03; fig. 2a).
we next investigated whether pharmacologic inhibition
of  xxxg411xxx /6 phenocopied sirna-mediated protein depletion by treating a panel of 17 neuroblastoma cell lines with
 xxxd3112xxx  across a four-log dose range (10–10,000 nmol/l).
treatment with  xxxd3112xxx  significantly inhibited substrate
adherent growth relative to the control in 12 of the 17
neuroblastoma cell lines examined (mean ic50 ¼ 306  68
nmol/l, considering sensitive lines only, where sensitivity
was defined as an ic50 of less than 1 mmol/l; fig. 3a). this
differential sensitivity to pharmacologic  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition largely reflected that of  xxxg411xxx /6 depletion by sirna,
in that  xxxg1488xxx  amplified cell lines were more sensitive to
 xxxd3112xxx  than nonamplified lines (p ¼ 0.01; fig. 3a) and cell
line  xxxg1488xxx  expression was inversely correlated with sensitivity (r ¼ 0.55, p ¼ 0.03; supplementary fig. s3). to

 xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition induces cytostasis that is mediated
by g1 arrest and senescence
analysis of the real-time substrate adherent growth curves
generated by  xxxd3112xxx  treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines
showed that growth inhibition in sensitive cell lines was
consistent with a cytostatic effect (data not shown). however, because responses to targeted inhibition of cyclindependent kinase pathways are not always strictly a result
of cell-cycle arrest (24–26), we sought to fully characterize
the mechanism of neuroblastoma growth inhibition in
response to pharmacologic  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition.  xxxd3112xxx 
treatment of 2 neuroblastoma cell lines (be2c and imr5)
with demonstrated sensitivity to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition
resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of cells in
the g0/g1 phase of the cell cycle (fig. 4a). this g0/g1
arrest became significant at inhibitor concentrations of
100 nmol/l (p ¼ 0.007) and 250 nmol/l (p ¼ 0.01),
respectively, and was also accompanied by dose-dependent
decreases in the percentage of cells in s and g2–m. as
expected, cell lines that were resistant to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition
arrested in g1 only at significantly higher doses of  xxxd3112xxx 
(ebc1, 5 mmol/l, p ¼ 0.01; sknas, no arrest achieved;
fig. 4a and b).
recently, a systematic screen for novel  xxxg411xxx /6 substrates
identified the foxm1 transcription factor as a potential
target of  xxxg411xxx /6 signaling, and implicated  xxxg411xxx /6-mediated activation of foxm1 in the prevention of cellular
senescence (8, 25, 27–29). these results are corroborated
by the fact that foxm1 inhibition, either by deletion or by
 xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition, impairs the self-renewal capacity of
cells (29). we therefore investigated whether or not inhibition of  xxxg411xxx /6 activity by  xxxd3112xxx  would induce senescence in neuroblastoma via downregulation of foxm1.
there was a significant reduction in foxm1 mrna as early
as 6 hours following administration of  xxxd3112xxx  to sensitive
cell lines, and modest but reproducible decrease in foxm1
protein levels (fig. 4c and d). this was associated with the
induction of cellular senescence in sensitive lines, as indicated by a significant increase in the percentage of sa-b-gal
positive cells (fig. 4e). by contrast, cell lines resistant to
 xxxd3112xxx  showed no reduction of foxm1 mrna or protein
following  xxxd3112xxx  treatment, and subsequently did not
senesce. as we did not observe significant increases in
 xxxg341xxx /7 activity or parp cleavage in sensitive lines
treated with  xxxd3112xxx  (supplementary fig. s5), these results

 xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition causes tumor growth delay in vivo
given the observed differential sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition, we assayed for in vivo
efficacy using neuroblastoma cell line–derived xenografts
representing the extremes of in vitro sensitivity. cb17 immunodeficient mice bearing be2c, nb-1643 ( xxxg1488xxx  amplified, sensitive in vitro), or ebc1 (nonamplified, resistant in
vitro) xenografts were treated once daily for 21 days with
 xxxd3112xxx  or with a vehicle control. this dosing strategy was
well tolerated, as no weight loss or other signs of toxicity
were observed in any of the xenograft models. as shown
in fig. 5a and supplementary fig. s6, tumor growth was

6178

clin cancer res; 19(22) november 15, 2013

significantly delayed throughout the 21 days of treatment in
mice harboring the be2c or 1643 xenografts (both, p <
0.0001), although growth resumed posttreatment (data not
shown). by contrast, as anticipated by the in vitro data,
tumor growth suppression was less robust in the ebc1
xenograft model (p ¼ 0.51). assessment of the ki67 proliferation marker by immunohistochemistry confirmed that
proliferation was impaired only in the be2c and 1643
xenograft models, as tumors resected from separate cohorts
of be2c or 1643 xenografted mice demonstrated comparatively weaker staining following 7 days of treatment with
 xxxd3112xxx  than with the vehicle control, whereas no ki67
staining differences were observed in the ebc1 xenografts
(fig. 5b). phosphorylation of rb was also substantially
diminished in the be2c and 1643 xenografts, whereas only
a minimal decrease was detected in the ebc1 model (fig. 5b
and c).

discussion
cure rates for children with high-risk neuroblastoma
have not significantly improved over the last decade, and
of those children who do achieve remission, half will
ultimately suffer a relapse (1). such unfavorable outcomes

6180

are due in part to the fact that the current treatment regimen
does not sufficiently leverage the unique biological features
of this heterogeneous disease. indeed, although  xxxg1488xxx 
amplification is the most common genomic lesion in this
disease, strategies to target this oncogene have not yet

 xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition in neuroblastoma

resulted in a clinical deliverable. in addition, although the
discovery that 8% to 10% of neuroblastomas harbor somatic activating mutations in the alk oncogene provides
another therapeutic opportunity (30, 31), most neuroblastoma patients will not have a somatic alk mutation that is
actionable with a targeted inhibitor (32–35). steps must
therefore be taken to identify additional molecular abnormalities that drive neuroblastoma disease progression and
to subsequently exploit them with targeted therapy.
the data presented here identify  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition as a
viable therapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma, with selectivity for patients whose tumors harbor  xxxg1488xxx  amplification.
specifically, we show that rb phosphorylation via  xxxg411xxx /6
signaling is nearly ubiquitous in neuroblastoma cell lines
and tumors and is likely the result of high expression of
 xxxg411xxx ,  xxxg414xxx , and  xxxg366xxx  (ref. 15; fig. 1), but there may be
other as yet undiscovered mechanisms of  xxxg411xxx /6 hyperactivation. however, despite the fact that  xxxg411xxx /6 signaling
is hyperactive in the majority of neuroblastoma cell lines,
not all are sensitive to  xxxd3112xxx . therefore, although the
finding that a  xxxg411xxx -amplified cell line (ngp) was highly
sensitive to  xxxd3112xxx  may be clinically relevant, our data
suggest that prb,  xxxg411xxx , or  xxxg414xxx  status alone cannot be
used to accurately predict a response to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition.
we instead show that sensitivity correlated significantly
with  xxxg1488xxx  amplification status. indeed, cell lines displaying sensitivity to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition by either sirna-mediated depletion or  xxxd3112xxx  treatment were likely to be  xxxg1488xxx 
amplified (figs. 2a and 3a) as well as harbor high  xxxg1488xxx 
mrna and protein levels (supplementary fig. s3). although myc-induced replicative stress may be a contributing
factor, the precise mechanism for this association is
unknown. nevertheless, the finding has important clinical
ramifications, as  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition may provide an alternative therapy for the 40% of high-risk neuroblastoma cases
harboring amplification at the  xxxg1488xxx  locus. future research, however, should focus on the discovery of additional
biomarkers of sensitivity as a means to identify a sensitive
patient population beyond  xxxg1488xxx  or  xxxg411xxx  amplification
status.
over the last decade, first-generation cdk inhibitors have
been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of adult
malignancies, and a number of second-generation cdk
inhibitors are currently undergoing phase i and phase ii
testing (7, 36). no clinical trial, however, has been adapted
for childhood malignancies. as we show that  xxxg411xxx /6
inhibition induces a cytostatic as opposed to a cytotoxic

effect on neuroblastoma growth, combination strategies
with conventional cytotoxic agents that rely on s-phase
dna replication may be antagonistic (37), suggesting that
 xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition may be best placed in the post-chemotherapy maintenance phase of treatment (immunotherapy
and retinoids). novel–novel screens with other agents that
do not rely on targeted dna replication should therefore be
explored in order to develop a combinatorial strategy that
will maximally inhibit the growth of residual, chemo-resistant cells. taken together, our data suggest that a subset of
neuroblastomas are highly sensitive to  xxxg411xxx /6 inhibition,
and support the clinical development of  xxxd3112xxx  in this
disease.
