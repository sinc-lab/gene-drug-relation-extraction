objective: the carnitine-associated alteration of myocardial fatty acid metabolism may be one of the molecular
mechanisms underlying left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) in essential hypertension. we tested the hypothesis that
polymorphisms of the genes involved in carnitine transport,  xxxg2112xxx ,  xxxg508xxx , cpt1b, and  xxxg509xxx , might be
associated with lvh.
design: haplotype-based association analysis in an observational study.
setting: outpatients from the nephrology division of the university hospital.
patients: a total of 215 never-treated, middle-aged patients with mild essential hypertension.
methods: relationships between left ventricular mass index (lvmi) (measured with m-mode echocardiography)
and haplotype combinations for 13 common genetic variants selected from single nucleotide polymorphism
database (dbsnps).
results: the snps were selected to cover the genomic region of the four loci, and a total of 23 haplotypes were
identified: 8 for  xxxg2112xxx  (h1 to h8), 8 for  xxxg508xxx  (h9 to h16), 3 for cpt1b (h17 to h19), and 4 for  xxxg509xxx  (h20 to  xxxd1322xxx ).
in a multilocus haplotype analysis, after adjusting for sex, age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
body mass index, and duration of hypertension, a significant effect on lvmi was seen for h13 (⫹8.9, p ⫽ .05), h14
(⫺5.63, p ⫽ .05), h15 (⫺18.79, p ⫽ .0006), h18 (⫺1.66, p ⫽ .03), and  xxxd1540xxx  (⫺3.42, p ⫽ .004). these significant
haplotypes were respectively 3.7%, 1.6%, 1.6%, 39.3%, and 29.7% of the total population.
conclusions: these results identify the carnitine-transporter gene family as candidate modifiers of lvmi in
human hypertension. the use of common snps to define informative haplotypes associated with the phenotype of
interest is the starting point for progress toward identification of the trapped contributing snp(s).

portion of interindividual variability of left ventricular mass (lvm) and consequent risk of lvh is
related to genetic factors.3 hypertension is the most
common cause of lvh, and impaired myocardial
fatty acid metabolism is an important molecular
adaptation in the hypertrophied heart.4 carnitine is
an essential cofactor for the ␤-oxidation of longchain fatty acid metabolism that provides approximately 70% of myocardial energy requirements.5
differences in serum carnitine levels may reflect
impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism.6 the
high-affinity sodium carnitine cotransporter
( xxxg2112xxx , omim: 603377) mediates the carnitine
transport from plasma to the cytosol. intracellular
esterification of long-chain  xxxd2154xxx  to the ␤-hydroxyl carbon of carnitine is necessary for their entry

into mitochondria. the carnitine palmitoyltransferase i (cpti) is an integral protein of the outer
mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the conversion of lc-acyl-coa to lc- xxxd3156xxx , which
can be transported across the mitochondrial membrane to be reconverted to lc-acyl-coa by  xxxg509xxx  (cptii, omim:
600650) for oxidation within the mitochondrial
matrix. two cpti isoforms are encoded by 2
different genes, cptia (omim: 600528) and
cptib (omim: 601987). the molecular basis of
several inherited cardiomyopathies, caused by major
alterations in the genes coding for carnitine transport into cells and in carnitine– xxxd3156xxx  shuttling, have been described in the last decade.7-9
these 4 genes could be attractive candidates for
investigating whether common genetic variants,
which may produce subtle changes in cardiac structure and function, may be involved in the regulation of lvm in essential hypertension.

methods
study subjects
the subjects of our study were previously
described.10 briefly, 215 (179 male, 36 female)
never-treated white (all italians), mild-moderate
essential hypertensive patients were recruited into
the study. to minimize environmental confounding factors, inclusion criteria were very restrictive. patients were required to have only
essential hypertension without (1) collateral diseases with cardiovascular implications, (2) any
previous or current pharmacologic treatment for
hypertension, or (3) obesity; the range of age was
25 to 65 years. echocardiography was performed
using a hewlett-packard imaging system (sonos
2500 model, palo alto, ca). lvm was calculated
at end diastole by applying the devereux correction to the american society of echocardiography (ase)-cube lvm formula11 and then was
indexed for body surface area, obtaining left ventricular mass index (lvmi).
genotyping
genomic dna was isolated from whole blood
according standard procedure. allelic discrimination of snps at  xxxg2112xxx ,  xxxg508xxx , cpt1b, and
 xxxg509xxx  loci was performed using 5= nuclease assay
on abi prism 7700 apparatus. in table 1 we
summarized the genbank identification number
of selected snps, the intron-exon position, the

3

allele frequency of the present population, the
forward (fp) and reverse (rp) primers, and the
minor grove binder (mgb) fluorescent probes
(6-carboxyfluorescin [fam] and vic labeled) for
allelic discrimination.

statistical analysis
haplotypes were reconstructed using the
phase software (version 1.0, 2001; available at
http://www.stat.washington.edu/stephens/).12
the program was appropriately modified to accommodate prior information derived from haplotype reconstruction in a population of 114
families (data not shown) to aid in the reconstruction procedure in unrelated subjects (present
population).
statistical analyses were performed with proc
glm, proc mixed in sas (sas software package, version 8.1, 1999; sas institute, cary, nc).
the dependent variable was lvmi. nongenetic
factors to be considered were sex, age, systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body
mass index, and duration of hypertension. the
effects of these factors (and the interaction between age, sex, and body mass indes, and the
other factors) were initially analyzed using oneway analysis of variance: a significant effect was
found for all of these. thus, they were all included in the haplotype effects analysis. significance of the haplotype effects was tested using
residual regression.

results
the clinical characteristics of the hypertensive
patients in this study were previously described.10
the relevant values (mean ⫾ se) for clinical parameters were: age, 42 ⫾ 0.6 years; body mass
index, 25.2 ⫾ 0.2; systolic blood pressure, 145.5 ⫾
1.04 mm hg; diastolic blood pressure, 96.8 ⫾ 0.65
mm hg; lvmi, 96.8 ⫾ 0.65 g/m2. only 17% of
the subjects presented lvh. the frequency distribution of lvmi is shown in figure 1. to determine whether polymorphisms in the 4 genes
 xxxg2112xxx ,  xxxg508xxx , cpt1b, and  xxxg509xxx  significantly associate with echocardiographic evidence of
lvh, we selected common variants (⬎5% minor
allele frequency) in the human population from the
available national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) dbsnps. for each locus, a minimum/maximum of 10/20 snps, spanning the entire gene region, were selected on the basis of the

known polymorphism in the general population.
the polymorphism was checked in a sample of 30
control subjects (all white subjects, data not shown)
and we excluded from further analysis the snps
with either a low minor allele frequency or complete correlation (redundancy) with other snps. a
total of 13 snps were genotyped in the 4 genes of
interest, and the length of the genomic segments
covered in each gene were  xxxg2112xxx , 22.4 kb;
 xxxg508xxx , 51.4 kb; cpt1b, 8.6 kb;  xxxg509xxx , 14.1 kb.
in table 1 the allelic frequencies for the selected
snps in our hypertensive population are presented.
none of these snps was significantly associated
with lvm. then we searched for haplotypes associated with the disease in the same cohorts, and the
results are summarized in table 2. for  xxxg2112xxx  we
obtained 8 haplotype combinations (h1 to h8) and
only h6, a rare haplotype identified in 1 individual,
had a significant positive effect on lvmi (⫹75.66

haplotype combinations (h9 to h16) with a significant negative effect of h15 (⫺18.79, p ⫽ .0006)
and h14 (⫺5.63, p ⫽ .05) and a positive effect of
h13 (⫹8.95, p ⫽ .046). these haplotypes represent
overall 6.2% of the total population. for cpt1b we
identified only 2 informative snps defining 3 haplotypes (h17 to h19), and a modest but significant
effect was seen for h18 (⫺1.66, p ⫽ .05). this
common haplotype represents 39.3% of the total
subjects. for  xxxg509xxx  we obtained 4 haplotype combinations (h20 to  xxxd1322xxx ), with a significant negative
effect of  xxxd1540xxx  (⫺3.42, p ⫽ .004) that represents
29.7% of the total subjects.

discussion
in this study, some haplotypes of carnitine transporters are associated either with a decrease or with

5

an increase of lvm in essential hypertension. lvh
is a well-known predicting factor of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality.1,2 the role of carnitine as
essential cofactor in the ␤-oxidation of long-chain
fatty acid metabolism, one of the main sources of
myocardial energy, has been reported.5 moreover,
an impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism was
recently shown in hypertrophied hearts.4 we can
hypothesize that these different haplotypes may lead
to different patterns of fatty acid metabolism, protecting or enhancing the development of lvh,
through an increase or a decrease of fatty acid
transport and relative myocardial fatty acid use and
oxidation. of course, we do not consider these data
as conclusive because the sample size is small and the
frequency for some haplotypes is low. however,
these data may have clinical relevance. in fact, major
genetic alterations in the carnitine transport system
already have been defined in several inherited forms
of myocardial diseases.7-8 therefore it is conceivable
that minor genetic alterations could associate with
more subtle variations in cardiac structure and function in a condition of pressure overload such as
hypertension. moreover, to detect genetic effects in
multifactorial diseases we need to minimize environmental confounding factors. a small cohort selected with very restrictive inclusion criteria such as
those requiring similar race, age, body, dimensions,
duration and severity of hypertension, and no previous pharmacological treatment could be informative for factors having a significant impact on disease. finally, the haplotype-based analysis with
common snps has a strong power to assess the
association between loci and the trait of interest.
the rare or single haplotypes with the strongest
effects, such as h6 (⫹75.66), h13 (⫹8.9), and h15
(⫺18.79), can define linkage units trapping contributing snps. in fact, rare contributing snps with a
strong effect typically reside on a few individual
haplotypes that act as significant surrogate markers.13-15
to conclude, these results identify the carnitine transporter gene family as candidate modifiers of lvm in human essential hypertension.
additional studies are needed both to confirm
our preliminary data on a larger sample size and to
correlate genetic variants with functional measurements of cardiac fatty acid metabolism. along
this line, the effect on lvm of administration of
carnitine derivatives in different haplotype carriers could be of paramount relevance to establishing the clinical impact of these findings. clearly

note. snp code is the same as in table 1. n is the number of chromosomes for each haplotype; lvmi is the left
ventricular mass index expressed as g/m2; and e is the effect on lvmi resulting from residual regression analysis after
adjustment for sex, age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and duration of hypertension.

interaction among different haplotypes of the
same gene family as well as among other contributing genes may be taken into account in the
genetic dissection of a multifactorial disease such
as hypertensive lvh.
