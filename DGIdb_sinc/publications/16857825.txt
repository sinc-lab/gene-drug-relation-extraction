abstract

the  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr) inhibitors  xxxd2029xxx , gefitinib, and cetuximab have
undergone extensive clinical testing and have established clinical activity in non ^ small cell lung
cancer and other types of solid tumors. a number of newer inhibitors are currently in clinical
development with different spectra of activity or mechanisms of receptor inhibition.these include
monoclonal antibodies, such as  xxxd2838xxx  and matuzumab; dual inhibitors of egfr and
 xxxg2413xxx  receptor, such as zd6474 and  xxxd86xxx ; inhibitors of multiple
egfr family members, such as lapatinib; and irreversible inhibitors, such as  xxxd421xxx  and
 xxxd2711xxx . preclinical studies suggest that several of these agents may have activity in tumors
refractory to  xxxd2029xxx  or gefitinib. among these agents, zd6474 has undergone the most extensive clinical testing. the antitumor activity of zd6474 in these two randomized phase ii clinical
trials in patients with non ^ small cell lung cancer was felt to be sufficiently promising to warrant
phase iii clinical testing. several of the other egfr inhibitors are also undergoing advanced clinical
testing, either alone or in combination with other agents. egfr has now been validated as a
clinically relevant target, and several different types of agents inhibiting this receptor are currently
in development. future research will be needed to elucidate the role of these agents in patients
with  xxxd1256xxx  ^ naive and  xxxd1256xxx  ^ refractory disease, to define the molecular
characteristics that predict response, and to determine whether these drugs should be used in
combination with other targeted agents or chemotherapy.

potential benefits of new egfr inhibitors
recent phase iii clinical trials have shown that agents
targeting the  xxxg681xxx  receptor (egfr)
pathway can prolong survival in patients with non – small cell
lung cancer (nsclc) and have significant activity in other
types of solid tumors as well (1, 2). in patients with previously
treated nsclc, a 2-month benefit in overall survival was
observed for patients treated with  xxxd2029xxx  compared with
patients in the placebo control arm (1). in the iressa survival
evaluation in lung cancer trial, no significant prolongation
in overall survival was observed for the overall nsclc
population, although certain populations did seem to benefit
(3). although the currently available egfr inhibitors  xxxd2029xxx ,
gefitinib, and cetuximab represent important advances, the
overall magnitude of this benefit has been modest, and in

almost all cases, resistance to egfr inhibitors eventually
emerges, even in patients initially sensitive to treatment. this
raises the question of whether additional benefit may be
derived from the use of newer egfr inhibitors currently in
development (table 1). potential advantages of these new
agents include:

1. improved potency or pharmacokinetics of egfr inhibition.
gefitinib and  xxxd2029xxx  have both been shown to at least
partially inhibit egfr phosphorylation in skin biopsies
taken from patients undergoing treatment (4, 5), although
the degree of egfr inhibition in nsclc tumor tissue is
not known. agents with greater potency, improved
pharmacokinetics, or higher tumor tissue concentrations
may provide a more sustained blockade of egfr signaling
and potentially greater benefit.
2. inhibition of multiple egfr family members. egfr signaling
occurs through both receptor homodimerization and
heterodimerization with other egfr ( xxxg682xxx ) family
members, particularly her2 and  xxxg722xxx  (6, 7), and
disruption of these interactions may increase the biological effects of egfr blockade.
3. inhibition of  xxxd2029xxx - or gefitinib-resistant mutations.
recent studies have revealed several potential mechanisms for the development of resistance to egfr
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors. these include secondary
mutations in egfr, such as t790m, that hinder the
binding of  xxxd2029xxx  and gefitinib to the atp-binding
pocket within the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  domain (8, 9).
in vitro data suggest that this resistance can be

overcome using irreversible inhibitors, such as  xxxd2711xxx 
(10). agents targeting the extracellular domain of egfr
would be predicted to be less susceptible to these
secondary mutations, although this hypothesis has not
yet been evaluated in the clinical setting.
4. dual inhibition of  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf)
and egfrs. egfr inhibitors have been shown to exert
antiangiogenic effects by decreasing the expression of
proangiogenic factors (vegf,  xxxg787xxx , and il-8; ref. 11)
and through direct effects on tumor endothelium (12).
these antiangiogenic effects may be substantially
increased by blockade of the vegf and egfr pathways
simultaneously. preclinical data suggest that one agent
inhibiting these two pathways (zd6474) may have
activity in gefitinib- or  xxxd2029xxx -resistant nsclc xenograft tumors (13, 14).
5. additive or synergistic activity in combination with chemotherapy. to date, the addition of egfr inhibitors ( xxxd2029xxx  or
gefitinib) to standard chemotherapy has not improved
overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy
alone in patients with previously untreated nsclc
(15, 16). egfr inhibitors have, however, shown benefit
when combined with standard chemotherapy in patients
with colorectal cancer (2) or pancreatic cancer (17). it is
not known if these disparate results are due to the
particular agents combined in the nsclc studies or to
differences in the biology of these tumor types.
selected egfr inhibitors in development are briefly discussed below. they are divided into small-molecule inhibitors
of the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  domain (reversible and irreversible), dual egfr/vegfr inhibitors, and antibodies directed
against the extracellular domain of egfr.

reversible egfr inhibitors
lapatinib is an oral dual kinase inhibitor that targets both
egfr and her2. in phase i testing in 67 heavily pretreated
patients with egfr and/or her2-expressing tumors, lapatinib
was well tolerated at doses ranging from 500 to 1,600 mg once
daily, with diarrhea and rash as the most frequently observed
adverse effects. clinical activity was observed, with partial
responses observed in four patients with trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancers and prolonged stable disease for >6 months in an
additional 10 patients (18). in a randomized phase ii
multicenter trial comparing two schedules and doses of
lapatinib in patients with chemo-naive advanced or metastatic
nsclc, there were no significant drug-related toxicities.
efficacy results from this trial are pending (19).

irreversible egfr inhibitors
 xxxd2866xxx  is an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the egfr and
her2 tyrosine kinases. a phase i study was conducted in 41
patients with advanced-stage tumor types known to overexpress
egfr using two schedules: daily for 14 days followed by a
14-day washout and continuously for 28 days. on both the
intermittent and continuous dosing schedules, dose-limiting
toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea. other adverse events reported
were rash, asthenia, anorexia, nausea, stomatitis, and vomiting.
no objective tumor responses were reported.  xxxd2866xxx  is
currently being evaluated in nsclc and in combination with
chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.
 xxxd421xxx  ( xxxd421xxx ) is an oral, irreversible inhibitor of all
four members of the  xxxg682xxx  receptor family. in a phase i dose
escalation study of 32 patients with advanced tumors,

egfr inhibitors in development

 xxxd421xxx  was given at doses up to 560 mg daily on a 14-day
on/7-day off schedule. no objective responses were observed,
although six patients had stable disease for >3 months. primary
adverse events included grade 1 to 2 rash, nausea, and
stomatitis. at the higher doses, the dose-limiting toxicities were
diarrhea and edema; the maximum tolerated dose was 450 mg
(20). minimal antitumor activity was seen in patients with
platinum-refractory ovarian cancer (21).
 xxxd2711xxx  is an irreversible  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor with dual
activity against egfr and her2. in vitro studies have shown
activity of  xxxd2711xxx  in nsclc cell lines with acquired resistance
to gefitinib (10). in preclinical xenograft studies,  xxxd2711xxx  significantly reduced the growth of her2- and egfr-dependent
tumors when given at doses between 10 and 40 mg/kg/d (22).
phase i trials to determine safety and tolerability are presently
recruiting patients.

dual egfr/vegfr inhibitors
zd6474 is an oral, quinazoline derivative inhibitor of egfr
and vegfr. phase i clinical evaluation has shown zd6474 to
be generally well tolerated, with a pharmacokinetic profile
appropriate for once-daily oral dosing and a half-life of >120
hours (23). phase ii evaluation of zd6474 has included two
randomized studies of patients with nsclc. in one of these
trials, the efficacy of zd6474 monotherapy (300 mg) was
compared with that of the  xxxd1256xxx  gefitinib in
previously treated patients. the adverse event profile of
zd6474 was similar to that seen in previous trials and included
rash, diarrhea, and asymptomatic qtc prolongation. a statistically significant improvement in time to progression was
observed for zd6474 compared with gefitinib (11.9 versus 8.1
weeks, p = 0.011). in a second trial, 127 patients with
platinum-refractory nsclc were treated with zd6474 (100
or 300 mg) or placebo, in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2
by i.v. infusion every 21 days; ref. 24). preliminary results show
a median time to progression was 12.0 weeks for docetaxel
alone, 18.7 weeks for zd6474 100 mg plus docetaxel (p = 0.07
for comparison with control arm), and 17.0 weeks for zd6474
300 mg plus docetaxel (p = 0.42). a randomized trial of
zd6474 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is also
ongoing (25). based on these results, phase iii trials are
currently being planned.

patients with chemotherapy-naive advanced nsclc. this study
has completed accrual with results pending.
matuzumab (emd72000), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against egfr, has been shown to have antitumor
activity in xenograft models. phase i clinical trials investigating
safety and pharmacokinetics have been conducted in patients
with advanced-stage disease treated weekly with 400, 800,
1,200, or 1,600 mg of matuzumab. overall, the doses tested
were well tolerated with toxicities, including grade 1 to 2
diarrhea and rash. the half-life was f110 hours. to examine
biological activity, skin biopsies obtained before treatment and
then again on day 29 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry
for phospho-egfr and phospho-mitogen-activated protein
kinase. complete inhibition of egfr and mitogen-activated
protein kinase activation was observed at the 1,200 and 1,600
mg doses, respectively (28). in a phase i study in which patients
with advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinomas were treated
with 400 or 800 mg matuzumab and ecx ( xxxd2008xxx ,
cisplatin, and  xxxd425xxx ), overall response rates at 400 and
800 mg were 57% and 43%, respectively, suggesting that the
combination has antitumor activity (29). a phase ii study
evaluating the efficacy of matuzumab in combination with
 xxxd2868xxx  in advanced nsclc is ongoing.
 xxxd2890xxx  (2c4) is the first in a new class of therapeutic
agents designed to inhibit the dimerization of her2 with egfr
and other her tyrosine kinases. a phase i study found
 xxxd2890xxx  to be safe and well tolerated, with the major
toxicities being diarrhea and rash (30). a randomized phase ii
trial was initiated to evaluate the activity of  xxxd2890xxx  in
breast cancer. overall, response or stable disease was observed
in <8% of patients (31). a phase ii study was also conducted to
determine the efficacy of  xxxd2890xxx  in chemotherapy-naive
patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. no prostatespecific antigen responses were observed (32). phase ii
evaluation of  xxxd2890xxx  in refractory or recurrent ovarian
cancer yielded somewhat more promising results, with objective tumor responses or  xxxg1483xxx  responses in 15% of patients
(33). based on the preclinical studies showing that inhibition
of egfr by multiple mechanisms may have an additive effect,
and that the activity of  xxxd2029xxx  in combination with
 xxxd2890xxx  is superior to that of either agent alone (34), the
combination of  xxxd2890xxx  and  xxxd2029xxx  is currently undergoing phase ii clinical evaluation.

concluding remarks
monoclonal antibodies targeting egfr
 xxxd2838xxx  ( xxxd2838xxx ) is a fully humanized monoclonal
antibody directed against egfr that binds with high affinity
(k d = 5  10 11; ref. 26). it has shown activity as a single agent
and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in colorectal
carcinoma. in a phase i trial, 96 patients with solid tumors were
treated with  xxxd2838xxx  monotherapy at various doses and
schedules (27).  xxxd2838xxx  was well tolerated and showed
clinical activity, including partial responses and stable disease.
these results were particularly encouraging in colorectal cancer,
as five partial responses were seen in 39 colorectal patients
treated. grade 3 skin toxicities were the most frequently
reported grade 3 to 4 adverse event (27). a randomized phase
ii study is currently evaluating the activity of carboplatin/
paclitaxel with or without the addition of  xxxd2838xxx  in

egfr inhibitors now have an established role in the
treatment of nsclc and several other tumor types, but benefits
have generally been modest thus far, and tumors have inevitably
developed resistance over time. fortunately, over the past several
years, two major developments have occurred that give reason
to believe that these therapies can be improved. the first is our
rapidly expanding understanding of the biological mechanisms
underlying the sensitivity of a tumor to egfr inhibitors and of
how therapeutic resistance emerges. the second is the development and clinical testing of multiple new egfr inhibitors,
including reversible and irreversible  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors,
dual vegfr/egfr inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. the
convergence of these two developments provides the possibility
for more specific and effective therapeutic regimens for patients
with nsclc and other tumor types.

novel agents in thetreatment of lung cancer: advances in egfr-targeted agents

open discussion
dr. tim eisen: zd6474 is an oral  xxxg482xxx .
looking at long-term pharmacokinetics, could it inhibit its own
absorption and could that affect the way that it works?
dr. heymach: there is no evidence that it induces its own
metabolism, if that is what you are asking. it has a 120-hourplus half-life; steady-state levels are reached after roughly 15
days or so. upon achieving steady state, the levels appear to
hold steady. we’ve looked at it in our trials in combination
with chemotherapy as well.
dr. eisen: you said that with zd6474 vegf inhibition was
achieved more effectively at 100 mg than egfr inhibition.
dr. heymach: from preclinical studies, we know the ic50
tends to be 5- or 10-fold lower.
dr. eisen: but is it not theoretically possible that you don’t
need as complete inhibition if you are inhibiting multiple
pathways?
dr. heymach: right. we are making assumptions based
on the ic50 from preclinical studies, but translating that into
what has happened clinically is something we are trying to
assess quantitatively with tumor biopsies. we have a clinical
trial right now with pre- and posttreatment biopsies to address
just this issue.
dr. thomas lynch: why was there no bleeding?
dr. heymach: one possibility is that it will act just like
bevacizumab, and we just haven’t looked at enough patients.
dr. lynch: but dave johnson saw bleeding in his phase ii
bevacizumab-carboplatin/paclitaxel study.
dr. heymach: yes, it was roughly 10% before selection, if i
remember correctly. it was 6 out of 66 patients. so if the
assumption, then, is that the bleeding occurs in large tumors,
which undergo a lot of necrosis quickly in the setting of
combination carboplatin and paclitaxel, then we may not have
big enough patient numbers yet. or something could happen
when you inhibit both vegf and egfr that may put the brakes
on the process. there may be a real biologic difference. the
bottom line is we don’t know. but we haven’t seen any evidence
of bleeding like that in the bevacizumab trial. we did have one
case of hemoptysis that occurred by a completely different
mechanism in the 006 trial. it was a cavity around an area that a
pneumonia formed. i don’t know that this has been seen with
other vegf inhibitors. so this suggests that there may be some
impact on tissue regeneration or wound healing, as seen with
bevacizumab.
dr. panos fidias: initially there were a couple of patients
with photosensitivity reactions. what happened with that?
dr. heymach: we believe those were all at the 300 mg dose.
the major reason for discontinuing at the 300 mg dose was the
rash. as dr. fidias’ question implied, there are actually two

components to the rash. it wasn’t exclusively the egf receptor
acneiform rash, but there was also a photosensitivity component to it as well.
dr. fidias: my other question is related to that. in the
preclinical model, the combination of  xxxd2029xxx  plus bevacizumab was the same as the big dose of zd6474. but you would
expect, clinically, that if inhibition of both pathways is
important, it would do better. it didn’t do better. it’s probably
because of the toxicity then.
dr. heymach: in our preclinical models, bevacizumab/
 xxxd2029xxx  and zd6474 always behaved similarly. the one exception being that in the  xxxd2029xxx  progressors, zd6474 looks a little
better than bevacizumab plus  xxxd2029xxx . so maybe those
particular tumors are more resistant to  xxxd2029xxx  specifically.
dr. fidias: but it is difficult clinically to give that kind of
dose to equal the  xxxd2029xxx  plus bevacizumab.
dr. heymach: it is hard to match up doses. we have spent a
lot of time addressing how we should dose these things. instead
of trying to match on an equimolar stoichiometric basis, we use
the established maximum doses that these drugs can be given to
mice. we do a regimen where we actually do dose reductions if
the mice lose weight on the drug.
dr. kwok-kin wong: in your preclinical models, do you
have any biological measure to show that you are hitting the
vegf pathway in terms of angiogenesis and not just hitting the
egfr pathway?
dr. heymach: we are in the process of analyzing these
tumors right now.
dr. glenwood goss: i know you presented the toxicity
data, but could you just give us your impression? at the 300 mg
dose, is the toxicity tolerable in the majority of patients?
dr. heymach: it’s a tough regimen when given at the higher
dose in combination with docetaxel. i think that the 100 mg
dose was dramatically better tolerated in combination with
docetaxel; in fact, it did as well as placebo. the 300 mg had
significantly greater toxicity, particularly rashes.
dr. goss: so you can’t push the dose further?
dr. heymach: in combination with docetaxel in particular,
there is probably an idiosyncratic reaction that occurs.
docetaxel has some skin toxicity itself. in combination with
carboplatin and paclitaxel, we haven’t had skin toxicity issues at
the 300 mg dose, at least to the same extent.
dr. goss: there is the ongoing question of adequate egfr
blockade with the 250 dose of gefitinib. so if the toxicity is
just related to docetaxel, there may be some room to push
that dose.
dr. heymach: an alternative approach is to use the lower
concentration during chemotherapy and then escalate to a
dose where you’re getting dual pathway inhibition in a monotherapy phase.
