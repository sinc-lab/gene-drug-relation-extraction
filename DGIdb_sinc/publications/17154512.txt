2-aminothiazole (1) was discovered as a novel src family kinase inhibitor template through screening of
our internal compound collection. optimization through successive structure-activity relationship iterations
identified analogs 2 ( xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx ) and 12m as pan-src inhibitors with nanomolar to subnanomolar
potencies in biochemical and cellular assays. molecular modeling was used to construct a putative binding
model for lck inhibition by this class of compounds. the framework of key hydrogen-bond interactions
proposed by this model was in agreement with the subsequent, published crystal structure of 2 bound to
structurally similar abl kinase. the oral efficacy of this class of inhibitors was demonstrated with 12m in
inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokine il-2 ex vivo in mice (ed50 ∼ 5 mg/kg) and in reducing tnf
levels in an acute murine model of inflammation (90% inhibition in lps-induced tnfr production when
dosed orally at 60 mg/kg, 2 h prior to lps administration). the oral efficacy of 12m was further demonstrated
in a chronic model of adjuvant arthritis in rats with established disease when administered orally at 0.3 and
3 mg/kg twice daily.  xxxd1815xxx  (2) is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia.
introduction
mammalian immunity relies on activation of t cells upon
antigen presentation. immune responses in t cells are initiated
by interaction of the t-cell antigen receptor ( xxxg2325xxx ) with an
antigen presented in the context of a glycoprotein encoded by
the major histocompatability complex (mhc). upon its engagement t-cell activation is amplified by sequential activation of
three distinct classes of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, namely,
the src family kinases ( xxxg1306xxx  and fyn), the syk family kinases
(syk and  xxxg2438xxx ), and the tec family kinases (itk, txk, and
tec). a cascade of downstream signaling pathways ultimately
leads to t-cell proliferation and/or differentiation and production
of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2 (il-2).
 xxxg1306xxx  (lck) is a member of the src family of nonreceptor
tyrosine kinases that share a high degree of homology,
particularly at the atp binding pocket. lck, expressed predominantly in t cells and nk cells is absolutely required for
t-cell development,1 activation,2 and initiation of the t-cell
antigen receptor (tcr)-mediated signal transduction pathway.
studies have shown that the catalytic activity of lck is regulated
by phosphorylation of tyr394 in the catalytic domain and
tyr505 at the c-terminus. upon autophosphorylation, activated

lck phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the immunoreceptor
tyrosine activation motif (itam) sequences of the invariant
chains (including the zeta chain) within the tcr. once phosphorylated, the zeta chain provides docking sites for  xxxg2438xxx  binding
via its sh2 domains.2c phosphorylation of  xxxg2438xxx  by lck and
the combined action of  xxxg2438xxx , lck, and the related src family
kinase fyn drives downstream signaling events and leads
ultimately to calcium flux, t-cell activation, and proliferation
(figure 1). genetics experiments using lck-/- mice have
validated lck as a potential immunosuppressive molecular
target.1a these mice display a scid-like syndrome and are
unable to reject skin grafts despite the presence of peripheral t
cells.3 in addition, overexpression of a dominant negative form
of lck leads to early arrest of thymocyte development prior to
expression of cd4, cd8, and the tcr.1b based on these data,
an lck inhibitor should inhibit t-cell activation and have
potential utility in the treatment of acute and chronic t-cell
mediated autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, including
solid organ transplant graft rejection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis (ra), psoriasis, and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.4 in addition, dysregulation of lck expression or
its kinase activity has also been implicated in human t-cell
leukemia,5 lymphocytic b cell leukemia,6 human colon carcinoma,7 and small cell lung cancer.8

screening of our internal compound collection using filter
binding assays11 identified aminothiazole 1 as an atp competitive lck inhibitor with a weak potency in biochemical and cellbased assays (murine lck ic50 ) 6.6 µm; human lck ic50 )
5 µm; t-cell proliferation ic50 >10 µm)).12 subsequent
structural modification through iterative structure-activity
relationship (sar) approaches led to the identification of
extremely potent pan-src inhibitors with picomolar activities
against these enzymes. within this class, several analogs also
showed potent inhibitory activity against bcr-abl kinase. we
describe here the synthesis, and sar studies leading to the
discovery of compounds 12m and 2 ( xxxd1815xxx ,
 xxxd1815xxx ),12c-e as extremely potent pan-src inhibitors (figure
2).
chemistry
thiazole analogs described here were synthesized following
the synthetic routes outlined in schemes 1-3. to prepare the
carboxamide, carbamate, and urea derivatives, appropriate
2-amino-thiazole-5-carboxylate 3 was treated with di-tert-butyl
carbonate in the presence of 4-(n,n-dimethylamino)pyridine in
thf to form the corresponding tert-butyl carbamate that upon
saponification afforded the acid 4. conversion of the carboxylic
acid to its acid chloride and its subsequent treatment with the
appropriate aniline in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in
dichloromethane or thf afforded the anilide 5, which on further
deprotection of the boc-protecting group in tfa formed the
aminothiazole 6. aminothiazole 6 served as an advanced
intermediate for the synthesis of carboxamide, and ureido
analogs. we utilized a solution-phase parallel synthesis approach
to prepare a wide variety of such analogs. accordingly, 6 was
treated with a carboxylic acid chloride or its anhydride in the

presence of an organic base to form amides 7. alternatively, 6
could be reacted with a carboxylic acid under standard peptide
coupling conditions to form 7. reaction of 6 with an isocyanate
in the presence of pyridine or 4-(n,n-dimethylamino)pyridine
formed the urea analogs 9. compound 6 could also be converted
to the phenyl carbamate 10, which on further reaction with an
amine in thf-acetonitrile mixture formed the urea 9. commercial availability of a wide variety of amines made the later
approach more attractive for the synthesis of diverse urea
analogs (scheme 1).
the 2′-aminoheteroarylthiazole anilide analogs were prepared
as described in schemes 2 and 3. ethyl 2-amino-thiazole-5carboxylate (3b) was converted to amine 6b following the
synthetic sequence outlined in scheme 1. compound 6b could
be directly coupled to an activated heteroaromatic halide to form
12. alternatively, 6b was treated with copper(ii) bromide and
tert-butyl nitrite in anhydrous degassed acetonitrile to form the
bromide 18, which on treatment with the appropriate heteroaryl
amine and sodium hydride in thf afforded 12 (scheme 2).
an alternate concise and efficient route was also developed
for this series of analogs and is illustrated with the synthesis of
2 (scheme 3). treatment of 2-chlorothiazole 19 with nbutyllithium at -78 °c followed by addition of 2-chloro-6methylphenyl isocyanate afforded anilide 14. protection of the
anilide followed by reaction of 15 with 4-amino-6-chloro-2methylpyrimidine in the presence of sodium hydride in thf
and subsequent removal of the pmb protecting group formed
17. further homologation of 17 by treatment with 1-(2hydroxyethyl)piperazine in dioxane afforded 2, which was
converted to its monohydrochloride salt with methanolic
hydrogen chloride in ether.
results and discussion
initial structure-activity studies. compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit lck using both biochemical and
cellular assays.13 our initial screening used recombinant mouse
lck ( xxxg1491xxx ) as the enzyme and enolase as substrate. subsequently,  xxxg1491xxx  was substituted with recombinant human lck
(hlck). because lck shares a high degree of sequence homology
(84%) between mouse and human, we reasoned this change will
have an insignificant impact on the observed ic50 values, a
hypothesis that was borne out by observation of a good
correlation for a set of analogs (tables 1 and 2).
broad screening of our in-house compound collection identified aminothiazole 1 as a lead with weak biochemical potency
against lck and little cell activity up to a concentration of 10
µm. the corresponding tert-butyl carbamate 5a was approximately equipotent and served as a starting point for further
optimization. as part of a systematic sar approach, we first
investigated the importance of the carboxanilide side chain on
the thiazole (table 1). substitution studies revealed an extremely
narrow structural requirement at this position. replacement of
the 2,4,6-trimethyl substituents on the benzamide with hydrogen
(5f) significantly attenuates potency. both the  xxxd26xxx  and 2, xxxd590xxx -me analogs (5g and 5j) are also significantly less potent.
the 2,6-di-me analog (5c) is only 3-fold less potent. the 4-me
substituent can be replaced with bromo (5d) without loss of
potency. either or both of the ortho-methyl substituents on the
benzamide can be replaced with a similarly small group (5b
and 5e) with minimal loss of potency. in contrast, substitution
with sterically demanding groups (5h and 5i) results in dramatic
loss in potency. overall, small substituents at both the ortho
positions on the benzamide ring are optimal for lck inhibitory

activity of these analogs. this finding is consistent with similar
observations with other classes of lck inhibitors.13,14 the ortho
substituents are most likely required to orient the aniline ring
out of the plane formed by the anilide and thiazole groups in
order that it can fit into a narrow hydrophobic pocket of the
enzyme (table 1).16
our attention turned next to the modification of the 2-amino
substituent on the thiazole ring (table 2). a large number of
diverse carbamates, carboxamides, and ureas were prepared
using a solution-phase parallel synthesis strategy. in general,
derivatization of the amino group leads to improved lck

inhibitory activity in vitro. for example, the methyl carbamate
(7a),  xxxd63xxx  (7c), and the methyl urea analogs (8a) are
roughly 3-20-fold more potent than 1. sterically demanding
groups in general lead to a significant loss in potency (5a, 7e,
and 8d). introduction of aryl and certain heteroaryl groups (7d,
7f-k, 8b, and 8e) also led to significant enhancement in
potency. in a direct comparison, the 2,4,6-trimethylaniline
analogs (7d, 7f, 7h, and 8c) are essentially equipotent to their
2-chloro-6-methylaniline counterparts (7l, 7k, 7j, and 8f).
n-butyl urea 8c was identified as the most potent inhibitor in
this series (hlck ic50 ) 30 nm).

sar studies were now directed toward modification of the
substituent at the 4′-position of the thiazole. with a series of
compounds in which the 2-amino group was functionalized as
its tert-butyl carbamate derivative, we observed earlier that the
replacement of the 4′-methyl substituent with several other
groups (h, et, ph, and cf3) led to significant attenuation in
biochemical potency (hlck ic50s > 30 µm). at this stage, our
sar findings in a related series prompted us to re-explore the
4′-substituent modification further. in a series of related
benzothiazoles,13a introduction of a cyclopropyl amide at the
2′-position (11) leads to a dramatic increase in lck biochemical
potency (figure 3). to our surprise, cyclopropyl amide analog
7n (table 3) with the 4′-unsubstituted thiazole core (hlck ic50
) 18 nm) is about 80-fold more potent than the corresponding
4′-methyl-substituted thiazole analog 7m (hlck ic50 ) 1.4 µm).
this observation is in sharp contrast with our earlier findings
in the tert-butyl carbamate series, where replacing the 4′-methyl
by a hydrogen resulted in a significant loss in activity.12a

proliferation in a t-cell proliferation assay (ic50 ) 884 nm).
further structural optimization was therefore focused on the
4′-unsubstituted thiazole core.
table 3 summarizes the c2′ carboxamide sar. replacement
of the cyclopropyl amide with an alkyl (7o), cyclobutyl (7v)
amide, or small alkyl substitution on the cyclopropyl ring (7p,
7q) leads to a substantial loss (>1000-fold) in potency.
benzamide (7r), cyclopentyl amide (7w), and the 2-thienyl
amide (7s) retains some of the intrinsic potency. only the
3-thienyl amide 7t displays comparable potency to 7n. however,
in the t-cell proliferation assay, 7t (ic50 > 2 µm) is less potent
than 7n. minor structural changes thus led to dramatic drops in
activity, and as such, a very narrow sar pattern was observed
in this series.
model of aminothiazole binding to lck. based on the
published crystal structure of the atp binding site of active,
autophosphorylated lck15-17 and homology modeling based on
a reported  xxxg1028xxx  structure,18 we constructed an lck binding site
model, as described in our previous communications.13,19 the
binding model of 7n highlights some of the critical h-bond
interactions with the active site residues. the aniline nh appears
to be positioned favorably for a productive hydrogen-bonding
interaction with the thr316 hydroxyl, and both the thiazole
nitrogen and the cyclopropyl carboxamide nh are in h-bond
contact with the backbone carbonyl and nh of met319,
respectively, at the hinge region of the protein. the cyclopropyl
group appears to fit snugly in a hydrophobic pocket. this
proposed binding mode is consistent with the 2,6-aniline
disubstitution, which orients the phenyl ring so that it can fit
into an angular deep but narrow hydrophobic pocket (figure
4).
to rationalize the 4′-me effect, we utilized the model
structures shown in figure 5. the preferred binding conformations for these compounds are represented by a1 and b1,
respectively. when subjected to sam 1d minimization, the 4′unsubstituted thiazole was shown to adopt either conformation
(a1 and a2) equally, while for the 4′-me thiazole, the preferred

conformation is b2. this conformation interferes with the ability
of 4′-me thiazole to adopt the required binding conformation
and may explain the difference in biochemical potency observed
between these series.
heteroaryl replacement of the 2′-carboxamides and
identification of 2. further sar investigations with the
 xxxd304xxx  lck inhibitors revealed that replacement of the
2-carboxamide function with certain heteroaryl amines led to
highly potent inhibitors (figure 6).13b molecular docking of 7n
(figure 4) suggested that the cyclopropyl amide carbonyl was
not engaged in any productive h-bond interaction. we, therefore,
rationalized that the c2′ carboxamide could be replaced with a
heteroaryl amine that can function as a conformationally
constrained “amide mimetic”. these studies were, therefore,
undertaken with the 4′-unsubstituted thiazole core (table 4).
replacement of the c2′ cyclopropyl carboxamide with a 2′′pyridyl amine (12a) leads to a 30-fold increase in biochemical
potency and a 6-fold increase in cell potency. regioisomeric
3′′- and 4′′-pyridyl analogs 12b and 12c are 6-8-fold less potent
than the 2′′-isomer. similar improvements in both biochemical
and cellular potencies were observed in the 2,6-di-me and 2,4,6tri-me aniline series (12d,e). a wide variety of heterocyclic
amine replacements (12f-i) were tolerated. methyl substitution
on the 2′′-aminopyridine ring (12j,k) leads to a further enhancement in both in vitro enzyme and cellular activity. 4′′,6′′-disubstitution on the pyridine ring (12l) is also tolerated. the
2′′,6′′-di-me-4′′-pyrimidinyl-substituted analog 12m was identified as one of the more potent lck inhibitors in this series. the

corresponding analog 12o in the 2,4,6-tri-me aniline series is
slightly less potent. similarly, the regioisomeric pyrimidinyl
analog 12n is significantly less potent (50-fold) than 12m,
suggesting specific interactions of the heteroatoms in the active
site binding pocket. based on its substantial potency, 12m (lck

characterization.
as in the  xxxd304xxx  series (figure 6), further enhancements in both biochemical and cellular activities with the
thiazoles are achieved through appending polar functional groups
to the heteroaromatic ring (table 5).13b
in the pyridine series, introduction of a weakly basic or polar
residue at the 6′′-position of the pyridine ring led to analogs
(12p-r) with subnanomolar activities against lck in vitro.
differentiation of these analogs at the biochemical level proved
quite difficult because the ic50 values approached the enzyme
concentration in this assay. more importantly, a 10-25-fold
increase in cellular potency was observed with the morpholino
and imidazolyl analogs 12q and 12r, respectively. a similar
trend was observed with the pyrimidine-based analogs. analogs
having a morpholino group directly attached at the 2′′-position
of the pyrimidine (12s,t) or tethered through an alkylamino side
chain (12u) displays nanomolar or below biochemical potency
and single digit nanomolar activity in the t-cell assay. finally,
introduction of a 4-hydroxyethylpiperazinyl side chain at the
2′′-position of the pyrimidine resulted in the identification of
one of the most potent analogs (2) in the series. compound 2
is roughly 30-fold more potent on t-cells than 12m.
characterization of 2′-(heterocyclo)amino-thiazole analogs. the proposed binding modes for 12m and 2 (figure 7)
are consistent with that of the cyclopropyl amide 7n (figure 4)
in that the key hydrogen-bond interactions of the pyrimidinyl
nh, thiazole nitrogen, and the anilide nh are preserved. the
critical requirement of the h-bond interactions of the pyrimidinyl
and anilide nhs for lck activity was demonstrated by synthesis

of the corresponding n-me derivatives, both of which are
significantly less potent than the parent 12m.12b a similar
attenuation in biochemical activity is observed with other
thiazole analogs.12a furthermore, as illustrated with 12m (left,
inset), the 2-amino pyrimidine ring appears to occupy a
relatively narrow hydrophobic pocket delineated by leu251,
tyr318, and gly322. this may explain the increased binding
affinity of the heteroaryl amine analogs in comparison to amides,
carbamates, and ureas. the polar 4-hydroxyethylpiperazine
residue in 2 approaches the solvent front and does not appear
to engage in additional h-bond interactions. the significant
increase in cellular potency of 2 and related analogs relative to
12m cannot be readily explained by our binding model nor is
it likely to be solely attributed to improvement of the physicochemical properties and/or cell permeability due to incorporation
of a polar side chain. nevertheless, 2 was identified as one of
the most potent lck inhibitors in the t-cell proliferation assay.
it is also possible that the lck construct used in the biochemical
assay is not a perfect reflection of the enzyme in cells.
to better understand their enzyme inhibitor properties, both
2 and 12m were evaluated for their selectivity against a panel
of in-house kinases, some of which are shown in table 6.
compound 12m was a potent inhibitor of all src family kinases
and bcr-abl kinase. a high degree of selectivity (>200 fold)
was observed against other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.
a similar selectivity profile was observed with 2, which strongly
inhibited the src family kinases lck, src, yes, fyn, c-kit, and
bcr-abl kinase with subnanomolar potencies. analog 2 was also
highly selective against other kinases tested. compounds 2 and
12m were further confirmed to be potent atp competitive
inhibitors of lck and src with ki values of 130 pm and 96 pm,
respectively, for 12m and 64 pm and 16 pm, respectively, for
2. in addition, 2 was a highly potent atp competitive inhibitor
of bcr-abl (ki ) 30 ( 22 pm). the lack of selectivity of these
analogs over other src family kinases is not unexpected, because
the kinase domain is known to be highly conserved among its
members. in addition, the structural similarities of lck and

activated abl kinase may explain the strong inhibition of the
bcr-abl kinase by these analogs.20
efficacy of compound 12m was evaluated ex vivo in a mouse
 xxxd2676xxx /anti-cd28 induced il-2 production model. when
dosed orally 2 h prior to  xxxd2676xxx /anti-cd28 stimulation,
compound 12m reduced serum il-2 level in a dose-dependent
manner with an ed50 value of approximately 5 mg/kg (figure
8).
compound 12m was further characterized in vivo in an acute
murine model of lps-induced tnfr. overproduction of tnfr,
a major proinflammatory cytokine is implicated in several
inflammatory diseases.21 the blockade of tnfr function by
anti-tnfr biologics such as enbrel (etanercept), remicade
(infliximab), and humira is demonstrated to be clinically
efficacious in the treatment of ra, crohn’s disease, and
psoriasis.22 when dosed orally 2 h prior to lps challenge, 12m
inhibited tnfr production in a dose-dependent manner (figure
9). statistically significant inhibition of tnf production (90%)
was observed at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg. this reduction in
tnf production may be attributed to the inhibition of src family
kinases  xxxg1028xxx  and fgr, which regulate tnfr production by
monocytes and macrophages. inhibition of p38 kinase (ic50 )
202 nm) may also contribute to the inhibition of tnf production
by this analog. compound 12m, a potent inhibitor of both these
kinases ( xxxg1028xxx  ic50 ) 2 nm, fgr ic50 ) 0.8 nm) inhibited lpsinduced tnfr production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) with an ic50 value of 670 nm.
the in vivo pharmacokinetic profile of 12m was determined
in rats. upon administration of single doses of 10 mg/kg (iv
and po), compound 12m had a peak plasma exposure of 2 µm
(cmax) with a tmax of 1 h. both plasma half-life (t1/2) and mean
residence time were approximately 4 h. compound 12m had a
moderate rate of plasma clearance (29 ml/min/kg) and a large
volume of distribution (vsss ) 12 l/kg), indicative of wide
tissue distribution. oral bioavailabilty of 12m in rats was
determined to be 65%.
t-cell activation is known to play a critical role in the
pathogenesis of ra.23 recent studies demonstrating the clinical
efficacy of  xxxg544xxx -ig, an inhibitor of the t-cell costimulation,
in ra patients has validated the strategy of blocking t-cell
activation for the treatment of ra.24 because lck plays a central
role in t-cell activation in response to antigen, we evaluated
the anti-inflammatory efficacy of 12m in a rat adjuvant arthritis
model of established disease, which is a widely utilized model
of human ra. furthermore, this model was chosen based on
acceptable pharmacokinetic profile, including oral bioavailability
of 12m in rats. in this model, male lewis rats were immunized
with complete freund’s adjuvant at the base of the tail and hind
paw volumes were measured to assess disease progression. rats
were treated with 12m or vehicle beginning on day 14 after
immunization when arthritic disease was well-established. as
shown in figure 10, 12m significantly reduced the progression
of paw swelling when administered orally at 0.3 and 3 mg/kg
twice daily.
conclusion
our broad screening effort identified the 2′-amino-4′methyl
thiazole 1 as a novel lck inhibitor. iterative sar studies showed
the 4′-unsubstituted-2′-amino thiazole to be an optimal template
for src family kinase inhibition. further structural refinements
on the 4′-unsubstituted thiazole core based on insights from sar
studies in a related series of benzothiazoles led to the discovery
of analogs 2 and 12m as highly potent pan-src kinase inhibitors.
in addition, using molecular modeling, we developed a putative

2-aminothiazole as a novel kinase inhibitor template

the framework of key hydrogen-bond interactions proposed by
this model is in agreement with the subsequent, published crystal
structure of 2 bound to the structurally similar abl kinase.12c
the oral efficacy of this class of inhibitors was demonstrated
with 12m in inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokine il-2 ex
vivo in mice and in reducing tnf levels in an acute murine
model of inflammation. the oral efficacy of 12m was further
demonstrated in a chronic model of adjuvant arthritis in rats
with established disease when administered orally at 0.3 and 3

of 2 as an exquisitely potent inhibitor of the src family kinases.

lck enzyme assay. for the preparation of recombinant lck,
human lck was prepared as a his-tagged fusion protein using the
commercially available (life technologies) baculovirus vector
pfastbac hta in insect cells. a cdna encoding human lck isolated
by pcr was inserted into the vector, and the protein was expressed
using the methods described by the manufacturer. the lck purified
by nickel affinity chromatography was incubated in kinase buffer
(20 mm mops, ph 7, 10 mm mgcl2) in the presence of the test
compound. the reaction was initiated by the addition of the
substrates to the final concentration of 1 µm atp, 3.3 µci/ml
[33p] g-atp, and 0.1 mg/ml acid denatured enolase and was
stopped after 10 min by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid
and 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, followed by 2 mg/ml bovine
 xxxg124xxx . the labeled enolase protein substrate was precipitated at 4 °c, harvested onto packard unifilter plates, and counted
in a topcount scintillation counter.
t-cell proliferation assay. a 96-well plate was coated with a
monoclonal antibody to cd3 ( xxxg19xxx -4), the antibody was allowed
to bind, and then the plate was washed. normal human peripheral
blood t-cells were added to the wells, along with the test compound
and anti-cd28 antibody (e.3), to provide costimulation. after 3
days, the [3h]-thymidine was added to the cells, further incubation
occurred, and the cells were harvested and counted in a scintillation
counter to measure proliferation.
inhibition of il-2 production ex vivo in mice. balb/c
female mice were dosed by oral gavage (po) with either vehicle
alone ( xxxd3034xxx -water, 1:1, v/v) or compound 12m
dissolved in vehicle. after 2 h, blood was collected into heparain
anticoagulant. triplicate cultures of each sample containing 100
µl whole blood and  xxxd2676xxx  antibody (10 µg/ml), anti-cd28
antibody (10 µg/ml), and goat anti-hamster igg antibody (30 µg/
ml) were established in 96-well plates. plates were incubated for
24 h at 37 °c in 5% co2. culture supernatants were collected and

2-aminothiazole as a novel kinase inhibitor template

assayed for il-2 concentration by elisa. results are shown as
mean ( sem of n ) 7 mice per treatment group.
inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  r (tnfr) in mice.
c57bl/6 female mice, 8-10 weeks of age (harlan teklad,
indianapolis, in), were dosed by oral gavage (po) with either vehicle
alone ( xxxd3034xxx -water, 1:1, v/v) or compound 12m
dissolved in vehicle. after 2 h, mice were injected intravenously
(iv) with 500 µg/kg lipopolysaccharide (lps, escherichia coli 0111:
b4; sigma, st. louis, mo). mice were bled 1 h after lps injection.
serum was separated from clotted blood samples by centrifugation
(5 min, 5000 × g, room temperature) and analyzed for the levels
of tnfr by elisa assay according to manufacturer’s instructions
(r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). results are shown as mean (
sem of n ) 11-12 mice per treatment group.
adjuvant arthritis in rats: treatment of established
disease. male lewis rats (150-175 g; harlan teklad, indianapolis,
in) were immunized at the base of the tail with complete freund’s
adjuvant. the volumes of their hind paws were measured in a water
displacement plethysmometer (ugo basile, italy). fourteen days
after immunization, when disease was clinically evident, rats were
randomized into treatment groups (n ) 8/group). rats were treated
orally twice daily with 12m at 0.3 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg in a vehicle
solution of  xxxd3034xxx /h2o (1:1). control rats received vehicle
alone. all procedures involving animals were reviewed and
approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.
