actions of  xxxd1868xxx  on cai neurons in
hippocampal slices from rats
g. erdembi and k. krsrjevie

abstract: membrane effects of  xxxd1868xxx  (dzx) were examined in cai pyramidal neurons, mainly by
whole-cell recording in slices kept at 33oc (from sprague-dawley rats). bath applications of dzx
(0.65 mm) did not significantly change the resting input conductance; but instantaneous inward
rectification was reduced by 47 f 14% (near - 110 mv). there was a similar depression of a large,
sustained voltage-dependent outward current (by 44 f 11% near 0 mv). a nearly identical reduction sf
the outward current recorded in a ca current suppressing medium (but not in 30 m m
tetraethylammonium) indicated h a t the bzx-sensitive current includes the delayed rectifier. in mn,
low-ca medium containing tetraethylammonium and carbachol, bzx potentiated (by 43 f 12%) the
d-type slowly decaying outward current seen after hypepolarizing pulses at a holding potential of
= -50 mv. dzx abolished or depressed slow inward currents, such as the tetrodotoxin-sensitive
persistent na current, high voltage activated ca currents (ic,, = 0.47 mm), and the q current. in 6 of
13 cells recorded with electrodes containing either guanssine or  xxxd80xxx , dzx potentiated
the voltage-dependent outward current, but input conductances were reduced. in conclusion, although
there was little indication that it activates classical katpchannels in cai neurons, dzx strongly
depresses several voltage-dependent, slowly inactivating outward and inward currents, which are
important modulators of cell excitability.

cook 1989; dunne et al. 1990) and the inhibition of the
hyperglycemic and hypotensive effects of dzx by sulphonylureas (trube et al. 1986; sturgess et al. 1988; quast
and cook 1989), which are potent inhibitors of katp
channels (de weille and lmdunski 1990), suggest that dzx
opens katbchannels in peripheral tissues.
dzx reduces the anoxic depolarization of ca3 hippocampal neurons (ben-ari et d. 1990), in keeping with evidence that katpchannels on mossy fibre terminals prevent
anoxic glutamate release (ben-ari 1990). moreover, dzx
enhances excitatory synaptic transmission in cai and ca3
regions of hippocampus, partly by increasing responses to
glutamate (yamada and rothman 1992; crepe1 et al. 1993;
randle et al. 1993) and partly by reducing those to gaba
(crcpel et d. 1993), possibly through a second messenger
pathway.
because of increasing interest in the use of katp-channel
openers, as experimental tools and as possible anticonvulsant
drugs, we examined the effects of dzx on resting properties, voltage-dependent currents, and anoxic currents in ca 1
pyramidal layer neurons. preliminary reports of some of the
results have been published (erdedi and krnjevic 1983,
1994a).

materials and methods
the experimental protocol complied with the principles and
guidelines of the canadian council on animal care and was
approved by the mcgill university animal care committee.
all experiments were performed on hippocampal slices
from 4- to 6-week-old sprague -dawley rats, weighing
188- 150 g . aker decapitation under halothane anesthesia,
the brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold,
' 'carhgenated9' saline (see below) ; both hippocampi were
dissected out, and 400 to 450 pm thick transverse slices were
cut with a mcilwain tissue chopper or a vibroslicer (wp
instruments inc., new haven, conn.). the slices were kept
for at least 1 h at room temperature, in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) of the following composition (in mm):
124 nacl, 3.0 kc1, 2.0 cac12, 1.25 nah2p04, 26
nahc03, and 10 glucose, continuously aerated with 95%
o2 - 5 9% c 0 2 ('karbogen") and at ph 7.3. a slice was
then transferred to the haas-type chamber (medical systems
cop., great neck, n .ye): for whole-cell recordings, the
slice lay on a piece of lens paper, just submerged in flowing
acsf; but for conventional intracellular recording, the slice
was at the gas-acsf interface. in both cases, the chamber
was copiously aerated with carbogen and maintained at
32.5 -33.0°c.
the patch electrodes had short shanks and tips of 2.5 3 pm. the standard filling solution contained 150 mm potassium  xxxd1905xxx  (kmes04), 10 mm hepes, 1.1 mm
egta-koh, 0.1 mm cac12, and 1 mm mgc12; the ph
was adjusted to 7.25 with koh. in some experiments, 1 mm
k2-atp, 1 mm na-gdp, or 1 mm k-adp was added to the
internal solution. the osmolality of the internal solutions
(measured with a precision systems micro osmometer,
natick, mass.) was kept between 287 and 300 mosmol
- kg-i. after filling, the electrodes had resistances of 57 mq. the electrodes were inserted along the plane of the
cai stratum pyramidale, at an angle of 45 ". "giga-seal"

cell contacts were readily obtained by suitable suction: when
sufficiently stable, they could usually be converted by faarther
suction to satisfactory whole-cell recording, easily recognized by the large fall in time constant and resistance and the
appearance of a substantial negative membrane potential and
large action potential ( 2 1oq mv). only recordings with a
series resistance of <20 mq were considered usefaal. for
intracellular recording, the conventional glass microelectrodes contained 3 m kc1 or  xxxd2987xxx  and had tip
resistances of 60 - 80 mq. to minimize the effects of
changes in junctional potential at the bath's ground electrode,
a second electrode, filled with either 3 m kc1 or the standard
internal solution, was routinely used as a '%bath probe."
when necessary, ca-dependent currents were suppressed
by the use of a phosphate-free acsf containing either
0.2 mm cdc12 or, more often, 0.4 mm cac12, 2.3 mm
mnc12, and 11 mm nahc03 (mn, low-ca acsf); and na
currents were suppressed by a low-na (1 1 mm) acsf, in
which na was replaced with either tetraethylammonium
(tea, 124 mm) or m-methyl-d-glucamine (124 mm). all
agents and drugs were bath applied: 1-2 mm kynurenic
acid, 10 pm bicuculline methiodide, 8.5 - 1 mm  xxxd3394xxx 
(from a 150 mm stock solution at ph 13, in naoh), 100 pm
cobalt chloride, 200 pm nickel chloride, 20-50 pm carbachol, 50 - 100 pm  xxxd1804xxx  (4ap), 38 mm tea,
and 1 mm  xxxd188xxx  (all from sigma inc.,
st. louis, mo.); 1 pm tetrodotoxin (ttx, from the qinhuangdao trading corp., china); 18-20 pm  xxxd2215xxx ,
from a 10 mm stock solution of  xxxd2215xxx  (a gift from
hoechst canada inc., montrkal, que.) in dmso (at the final
concentration of 0.1 % dmso has no significant effect on
outward currents (erdemli and krnjevit 1984b)); and
50 -650 pm dzx, diluted from a  xxxd1868xxx  solution (given
by schering canada inc ., montrcal, que .) containing 15 rng
dzx and 2.9 mg naoh per millilitre.
all recordings were done with an axoclamp-2 amplifier
(axon instruments, burlingame, calif.) in the discontinuous
voltage-clamp mode, operating most often at a sampling frequency of 3 h z , gain of 25 na/mv, and with the bandwidth
upper limit set at 300 hz. the usual precautions were taken
to optimize the performance of the clamp circuit and electrode. voltage-dependent currents were elicited either with
0.5 s depolarizing and hyperpolarizing pulses or with depolarizing voltage ramps ( = 10 or =50 mv/s). final ("steady
state") values of sustained outward and inward currents were
measured at the end of the &polarizing voltage pulses. such
slow somatic currents we believe can be assessed with reasonable accuracy even in slices, although the limited temporal
and especially spatial resolution preclude any usehl measurements of fast na currents.
in the current-clamp mode, the input resistance (rn) was
measured only with single hyperpolarizing pulses of constant
intensity. the input conductance (&) was calculated from
voltage-clamp data by fitting regression lines to the linear
portion of "instantaneous9' current/voltage (nv)plots, in
the region negative to the holding potential (vh) (fig. 1).
throughout the text, data are expressed as means f standard
error. the significance of differences between observations
was evaluated by student's t test.
to minimize any indirect effects of dzx, caused by
changes in glutamate or gaba release (ben-ari et al. 1980)

intracelhlar recordings with ''sharp " microebectroales
during superfusion with plain acsf (containing no kynuremte or bicuculline), 10 cai neurons were recorded with
3 i'vl kc1 or  xxxd2987xxx  microelectrodes, by current
clamp. bath applications of dzx (0.65 mm, mostly for
6- 18 min) had variable effects on membrane potential (vm)
and itn. m r e often depolarizing (in 6 of 18 tests) than
hyperpolarizing (3 of lo), giving a nonsignificant mean
change in vm of 3.1 f 1.8 mv. small increases in itn were
more consistent (in 8 of 10 tests), but the mean change
(15.2 f 7.4 %) was also not significant: for n = 18, p >
8.05. in contrast, in cells of the same series, 2 min of anoxia
had a mostly hyperpolarizing effect and reduced rn by
= 50 9% (as previously observed, kmjevic 1993).
intraeellular recordings were also made by voltage clamp,
from six other cells, in the presence of ttxgkynurenate, and
bicuculline. bzx (0.65 mm) did not significantly change
either the holding current (ihpin keeping with the currentclamp recordings) or gn (table 1).

whole-cell recordings with p t c h electrodes
a total of 24 cells were studied under voltage clamp, with
kmes04 electrodes, and at a vh near -50 mv. in standard
acsf (n = 5), dzx had no effect on g,, but there was a
significant outward shift. this is most simply explained by
suppression of a persistent inward current (see below), since
it was not seen in mn, low-ca acsf nor in intracellular
recordings in the presence of ttx (table i).

most voltage-dependent k currents are depressed by bzx
instantaneous inward rectifier (iir)
a voltage-sensitive k current is rapidly activated by hyperpolarizing pulses and causes anomalous rectification in v/i
and i/vplots (hotson et al. 1979; haliiwell and a d a m 1982;
brown et al. 1990). to measure this current, the slow inward
relaxation (q current) was extrapolated to the origin. the ini-

tial inward rectifying current should consist principally of
iir(although we cannot exclude some overlap of early iq).
such an iirwas observed in 21 of 30 cells. it was quantified by comparing the p/v slopes (gn) near vh and near
- 110 mv. for example, in fig. 1, the control data have
a slope of 6.5 ns between -50 m d -70 mv (gn) and

11.5 ns (77% higher) between -80 and - 100 mv (iir).in
17 of these 21 cells, the rectification was reduced by dzx
(fig. 1 and inset traces in fig. 8): thus in fig. 1, in the
presence of dzx the z/v slope remained constant (8.0 ns)
between -50 and - 100 mv; so in this cell, zir was eliminated by dzx. overall, for the 21 cells, the rectifications,
estimated by comparing in the same way the z/v slops near
resting v, and at - 109 f 2.4 mv, were very significantly
reduced (by 47 f 14.5%; for n = 21; p < 0.885). prolonged washing (for 20-30 min) led to full recovery in 3 of
5 cells.

outward currents and delayed rectifier (idr)
in standard acsf, a strong, sustained outward current was
evoked by deplarizing pulses to near 0 mv. dzx (0.65 mm)
reduced this current by nearly 50% (fig. 2a and table 1).
outward current tails showed a comparable depression (by
36 $ 8.5 % ;p e 0.01). for two of these cells, the recording
electrodes also contained 2 mm atp (and mg), as a control
against depletion of atp, in whose absence dzx may not
activate katpchannels (ashford 1990). the effects of dzx
were indistinguishable from the overall results: there was no
significant change in 6 ( - 19 f 19%) and the outward
currents were reduced by 52 f 2 1.2 % . in three other cells,
recorded in the presence of ttx with intracellular electrodes, dzx strongly depressed similar outward currents
(figs. 4a -4c and table 1).
to narrow the search, ca-dependent currents and m current were eliminated with mn, low-ca acsf containing carbachol, thus leaving the delayed rectifier as the predominant
outward current. under these conditions, dzx depressed to
a similar extent the remaining current, evoked by pulses to
v 1 0 mv (fig. 3a and table 1). in six cells positive-going

ramps (at =50 mv/s, fig. 4f) generated comparable outwardly rectifying currents (6.0 f 2.6 na, at v = -20 mv),
which were also sharply depressed by dzx (by 39.0 rf
9.5%; p < 0.01; figs. 4d and 4e).
the dzx-sensitive outward current was abolished by
30 mm tea, confirming its identity as the delayed rectifier
(segal and barker 1984; storm 1990; halliwell 1990; zhang
et al. 1992). in 11 cells bathed in mn, low-ca acsf containing carbachol and 30 mm tea, large depolarizing pulses (to
12 f 2.7 mv) evoked an outward current of only 0.92 f
0.23 na, which was not significantly changed by dzx
(table 1).

outward currents recorded with gdp- or alp-containing
electrodes
in whole-cell recordings with gdp-containing electrodes,
cromakalim, another katp-channelopener that also depresses
outward currents of cai cells (erdedi amd krnjevic 1994b),
enhances a  xxxd2215xxx - and atp-sensitive outward current
(erdedi and krnjevic 1994~).we therefore tested the
effects of dzx on 10 neurons during whole-cell recording
with electrodes containing 1 mm gdp. in 4 of these 10 cells,
dzx enhanced the voltage-dependent outward current (by
38 $ 8.1 %, n = 4), but without any increase in gn or zh
(table 2). the outward currents (and 6 ) of six other cells
were reduced by dzx (by -48.2 f 12.5 %, n = 6).
other nucleotide diphosphates may also potentiate katp
currents and openers (tung and kurachi 1991; beech et al.
1993; larsson et al. 1993). therefore we recorded four cells
with electrodes containing 1 mm adp. in two, dzx
increased the voltage-dependent outward current by 425 and
22.9 % , respectively (in one case, a subsequent application of
 xxxd2215xxx  (10 pm)reduced the dzx effect by 2 1.6%). over-

(fig. 6 and table 3), the inward current again virtually disappeared when dzx was applied ( -92 f 5.1 % ;p < 0.80 1,
from -30 f 14.8 pa, n = 7).
the persistent inward current of two cells diminished by
72 and 100% after changing to mn, low-ca acsf with na
reduced to 11 mm (na was substituted by n-methyl-dglucamine) (fig. 6a, cf.
and 0 ) . the inward current
recorded in two other cells in mn, low-ca acsf (plus carbachol and tea) was reduced by 69 and 100% by the addition
of 1 pm ttx (fig. 6b). these results support our previous
evidence h a t the current suppressed by dzx may be a
persistent na-dependent and ttx-sensitive inward current
(erdedi and kmg'evic 1993).

high voitage activated (hva) ca currents
in acsf containing ttx, 30 mm tea, and i mm ba,
inward currents were evoked by depolarizing pulses from
f.', near -50 mv (in order to improve voltage control, in
some experiments the currents were reduced by lowering
acsf [@a]to 0.20 rnm and adding 0.20 m m nic12). there
was no major rundown of such currents during the 10- to
20-min periods necessary to test dzx (cf. the absence
of effect of low concentrations of bzx in fig. 7b). the
sustained inward currents (measured at the end of the 580-ms
pulses) were sharply depressed by bzx (0.65 mm), so that
the peak currents in h/vplots (such as fig. 7a) were reduced
by about 40 % (table a), with no consistent change in voltage

inward currents evoked by deblarizing ramps (not shown).

applications of dzx (0.65 mm, for 7 min), to 28 and 0% of

were partly restored by washing for 15 min (to 50 and 12.5%

that it was a ca current. neither  xxxd3394xxx  (1 mm) nor

q current
this na- and k-mediated inward rectifier is identified by its
slow activation and resistance to block by ba (halliwell and
adms 1982; segal and barker 1984; brown et al. 1990).
the slow inward relaxation evoked by hyperpolarizing
pulses (figs. 8 and 1, insets, below broken lines) was
reduced by 0.65 mm dzx in 22 of 26 cells, giving a significant overall decrease of 29 f 7.4% ( p < 0.81 for n = 26,

discussion
in contrast to some neurons in the substantia nigra and caudate nucleus, where dzx appears to activate magp channels
(murphy and greenfield 1992; schwanstecher and panten
1994), there was no convincing evidence that dzx increases
the resting 6of cab neurons, either in intracellular or in
whole-cell recordings. these negative results confirm most
previous studies on hippwmpd neurons, which also reprted
no change in resting properties (krnjevic and ben-ari 1989;
ben-ari et al. 1990; yamada and rothman 1992; crcpel
et al. 4993; randle et d. 1993). a tendency to elicit an outward current (which may account for some previous reports
of a hyperpolarizing effect (ohno-shosdm and yamamoto
1992; riepe et d. 1992) may well result from the suppression of ongoing inward currents (the persistent na current
(brown et al. 1990; french et al. 1990; taylor 1993) and the
inward rectifying q current (halliwell and adams 1982;
maccaferri et al. 1993)), as well as potentiation of the
outward d current (storm 1988, 1990). thus, cai neurons
behave more like hypothdamic cells, where dzx also does
not activate kagpchannels (sellers et al. 1992). it is still not
clear whether hippwarnpd neurons have katpchannels,
either of the classical (noma 1983; ashcroft 1988) or the
hypothdamic (ashford et al. 1990) variety.
unlike nigrd cells, cab neurons showed no anoxia-like
effects of dzx. in the present recordings with kmes04
electrodes, anoxic changes were more pronounced than in
whole-cell recordings with potassium gluconate electrodes
(zhang and krnjevic 1993). this is in keeping with evidence
that anoxia activates an ahp-type k current (erdemli and
krnjevic 1994d) and that slow anp9sare much less prone
to run down when recorded with electrodes containing
mes04 rather than gluconate (zhang et d. 1994).
in about one-half of the cells recorded with nucleotide
diphosphate (ndp) containing electrodes, dzx potentiated
the voltage-dependent outward current. however, this effect
was less frequent than the comparable ndp-dependent action
of c r o m ~ i m(erdendi and krnjevic 1994~).it was not
accompmied by an increase in either resting conductance or
holding current. being typically outwardly rectifying, the
potentiated current differed from the classical katpcurrent,
which is characteristically inwardly rectifying (ashcroft
1988; de weille and lazdunski 1990; ashford 1990). it
seems that classical katpchannels cannot be very prominent
in hippocampal neurons.
according to observations on insulin-secreting cells (shrgess et d. 1988; zijlnher et al. 1988; kozhowski et al. 1989;
ashford 1990; m&szlowskiand ashford 1992; larsson et ab.
1993), dzx can open katbchannels only when they have
been partly closed by atp and mgzf is present; at the s m e
time, cytosolic mg2+ tends to depress peak katpcurrents
(tohwo and noma 1993). the addition or removal of atp
and mg" (to the internal solution) in the present experi-

ments did not alter the effects of dzx. furthemore, as a
control for a possible loss of critical cytoplasmic factors into
patch electrodes, we also recorded from 16 cells with conventional intracellular electrodes but obtained no clearer
evidence that dzx activates classical katpchannels.
dzx was by no means without effect on membrane currents. like cromakalim (erdedi and krnjevie 1994b), it
consistently potentiated the d current. this is consistent with
a more or less direct interaction with sulphonylurea receptors, because cromakdim9s action could be reversed by
 xxxd3394xxx , and previous experiments have shown that
sulphonylureas depress the d current (crcpel et ab. 1992).
at the relatively high concentrations (near 0.5 mm) that
are commonly applied flrube et al. 1986; kozlowslci et al.
1989; ben-ari 1990; kozlowski and ashford 1992; murphy
and greenfield 1992; yamada and rothman 1992; crcpel
et al. 1993; randle et d o1993; schwanstecher and banten
1994), dzx typically depresses both outward and inward
voltage-dependent currents. with the exception of the persiscurrent, which was fully blocked by 0.65 mm dzx,
tent %\%a
currents were ody about half blocked at this concentration
(the highest that could be reliably applied). as repeatedly
emphasized by previous authors (kozlowslei et al. 1989;
kozlowski and ashford 1992; yamada and rothman 1992;
crcpe1 et d. 1993), the effects of such concentrations of
dzx are not readily reversible by washing or by sulphonylureas, suggesting a nonspecific action of dzx, perhaps
by direct channel block.
in addition to its marked actions on synaptically mediated
responses (ben-ari 1w0; ymada and rothman 1992; crcpel
et al. 1993; randle et al. 1993), dzx can exert a variety of
effects on intrinsic membrane currents of cai neurons.
their fknctional consequences, e.g ., in terms of changes in
excitability, evidently depend on the prevailing membrane
ptential. near the resting potential, the main dzx-sensitive
currents are (i) the persistent na inward current, which has
a major role in facilitating neurond firing (brown et d.
1990; french et al. 1990; taylor 1993) and is basically
eliminated by dzx; (ii) the q-type inward rectifier (brown
et al. 1990), which may also be active at resting potential
(maccaferri et d. 1993); and (iii) the d-type outward current
(storm 1990). according to storm (1988), an ongoing d
"window" current probably contributes to the resting conductance of cai neurons. thus, when vm is near its resting
level, dzx could reduce excitability and firing, and possibly
cause a modest hyperpolarkation,as has been indeed observed
in some previous studies (ohno-shosah and yamarnoto
1992; riepe et al. 1992), as well as in a minority of cells in
the present experiments.
when cells are depolarized, however, dzx has mixed
effects on excitability: by reducing outward currents (including the delayed rectifier), dzx would reinforce depolarization and retard postspike repolarization; but the depression of
sustained inward current acts in the opposite direction. one
therefore cannot easily predict which of these divergent tendencies would predominate.
in conclusion, the present findings show that the effects
of dzx on cai pyramidal neurons are quite different from
those on non-neuronal peripheral structures, where dzx
causes a major increase in &, mainly by opening katp
channels, but has no effect on voltage-dependent currents.

although there is no convincing evidence that bzx activates
classical katpchannels, the depression of voltage-dependent
outward and inward currents can be expected to modulate
significantly the firing behaviour of hippocampal neurons.
