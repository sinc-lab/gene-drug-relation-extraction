 xxxd2113xxx  is a class i antiarrhythmic drug and a potent inhibitor of the cardiac ( xxxg2028xxx )
sodium channel. although the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition of  xxxg2028xxx  is typically enhanced by
depolarization, the contributions of the open and inactivated states to  xxxd2113xxx  binding
and inhibition remain controversial. we further investigated the state-dependent binding of
 xxxd2113xxx  by examining its inhibition of rapidly inactivating and non-inactivating mutants
of  xxxg2028xxx  expressed in xenopus oocytes. applying  xxxd2113xxx  while briefly depolarizing
from a relatively negative holding potential resulted in a low-affinity inhibition of the
channel (ic50 = 345 µm). increasing the frequency of stimulation potentiated the  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition (ic50 = 7.4 µm), which progressively increased over the range of voltages where
 xxxg2028xxx  channels activated. this contrasts with sustained depolarizations that effectively
stabilize the channels in inactivated states, which failed to promote significant  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition. the voltage sensitivity and strong dependence of the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition on
repetitive depolarization suggests that  xxxd2113xxx  binding is facilitated by channel opening
and that the drug does not directly bind to closed or inactivated channels. the binding of
 xxxd2113xxx  to open channels was further investigated in a non-inactivating mutant of  xxxg2028xxx .
 xxxd2113xxx  produced a time-dependent decay in the current of the non-inactivating mutant
that displayed kinetics consistent with a simple pore blocking mechanism (k d = 11 µm).
at hyperpolarized voltages,  xxxd2113xxx  slowed the recovery of both the rapidly inactivating
(tau = 81 ± 3 s) and non-inactivating (tau = 42 ± 3 s) channels. mutation of a conserved
isoleucine of the d4s6 segment (i1756c) creates an alternative pathway that permits the
rapid diffusion of anaesthetics out of the  xxxg2028xxx  channel. the i1756c mutation accelerated
the recovery of both the rapidly inactivating (tau = 12.6 ± 0.4 s) and non-inactivating
(tau = 7.4 ± 0.1 s) channels, suggesting that  xxxd2113xxx  is trapped and not tightly bound within
the pore when the channels are closed or inactivated. the data indicate that  xxxd2113xxx  rapidly
gains access to its binding site when the channel is open and inhibits na+ current by a
pore blocking mechanism. closing of either the activation or the inactivation gate traps
 xxxd2113xxx  within the pore resulting in the slow recovery of the drug-modified channels at
hyperpolarized voltages.

 xxxd2113xxx  is an orally administered class i antiarrhythmic drug that is used in the management
cardiac arrhythmias (anderson et al. 1989; henthorn
et al. 1991).  xxxd2113xxx  produces a potent voltage- and
frequency-dependent inhibition of cardiac na+ channels,
attributes that have generally proven to be beneficial in
the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias (hondeghem &
katzung, 1984).unfortunately, the cast antiarrhythmic
drug trial discovered that the use of  xxxd2113xxx  is
associated with increased mortality in patients with

c the physiological society 2004

cardiac arrhythmias resulting from myocardial infarction,
which has significantly limited its general use as an antiarrhythmic agent (cast investigators, 1989). despite the
proarrhythmic potential associated with its use,  xxxd2113xxx 
has proved to be effective in treating atrial fibrillation,
supraventricular arrhythmias, and long qt syndromes
linked to naturally occurring genetic mutations of the
cardiac na+ channel (brugada et al. 2000; benhorin et al.
2000; windle et al. 2001). in the later case the efficacy
of  xxxd2113xxx  has been attributed to the preferential block

e. ramos and m. e. o’leary

of the enhanced steady-state current characteristic of
patients carrying the  xxxg2028xxx  mutations (nagatomo et al.
2000).
although the clinical use of  xxxd2113xxx  has been limited
by the results of the cast trials, its strong preference for
binding to activated states (i.e. open, inactivated) makes
 xxxd2113xxx  a valuable tool for studying the state-dependent
binding of anaesthetics. the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition of
na+ channels is enhanced by rapid repetitive
depolarization and increases over the range of voltages
where the channels activate (ragsdale et al. 1994, 1996;
qu et al. 1995; liu et al. 2002). for these reasons
 xxxd2113xxx  is generally considered to be an activated
or open state inhibitor of the  xxxg2028xxx  channel (anno &
hondeghem, 1990; nitta et al. 1992; nagatomo et al. 2000).
preferential interaction and inhibition of open channels
is further supported by studies showing that  xxxd2113xxx 
selectively reduces the open times of single na+ channels
(grant et al. 2000). by contrast, prolonged depolarizations
that stabilize na+ channels in inactivated states fail to
promote  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition, indicating that direct
binding to inactivated channels may not significantly
contribute to the na+ channel inhibition (nitta et al.
1992; nagatomo et al. 2000; liu et al. 2002; wang et al.
2003). this contrasts with studies of anaesthetics such
as the class ib antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine in which
na+ channel inhibition progressively increases with
sustained depolarization and is consistent with high
affinity binding to inactivated states of the channel
(bean et al. 1983; sanchez-chapula et al. 1983; clarkson
et al. 1988). recent studies suggest that although
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition is facilitated by channel opening,
the high-affinity binding and subsequent slow recovery
at hyperpolarized voltages is more closely linked to
rapid inactivation (liu et al. 2002, 2003). the relative
contribution of  xxxd2113xxx  block of open channels and
inactivated-state binding to na+ channel inhibition
remains controversial.
in this study, we investigated the state dependence of
 xxxd2113xxx  binding and inhibition of rapidly inactivating
and non-inactivating mutants of the  xxxg2028xxx  channel.
our studies of the wild-type channel are consistent with
previous work showing that channel opening is required
for  xxxd2113xxx  binding and inhibition.  xxxd2113xxx  induces
a characteristic time-dependent decay in the current
of the non-inactivating mutant that displays properties
consistent with an open-channel blocking mechanism.
the data indicate that  xxxd2113xxx  gains access to the
cytoplasmic binding site by entering through the open
channel and inhibits na+ current by a pore blocking
mechanism. either deactivation or inactivation appears
to trap  xxxd2113xxx  within the channel resulting in the slow
recovery at hyperpolarized voltages. the rapid  xxxd2113xxx 
block of open channels at depolarized voltages and the
slow untrapping at hyperpolarized voltages appears to

methods
expression of  xxxg2028xxx  in oocytes

the cdna encoding the human cardiac ( xxxg2028xxx )
na+ channel inserted into pcdna plasmid (invitrogen)
was linearized with xba i and full length capped mrna
transcribed using the t7 promoter (mmessage mmachine,
ambion, austin tx, usa). oocytes were harvested
from mature female xenopus laevis (xenopus i, ann
arbor, mi, usa). the animals were anaesthetized by
immersion in tricaine (1.5 mg ml−1 ) and several ovarian
lobes surgically removed under sterile conditions. the
adhering follicle cell layer was removed by incubating
oocytes with 1 mg ml−1 collagenase (sigma chemical,
st louis, mo, usa) in calcium-free or2 (82.5 mm nacl,
2.5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2 , 5 mm hepes, ph 7.4) solution
for 2 h. the oocytes were washed with calcium-free or2
and transferred to or3 (70% leibovitz l-15 medium, life
technologies) supplemented with 15 mm hepes (ph 7.4),
5 mm l-glutamine, and 10 mg ml−1  xxxd2193xxx . stage
iv–v oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of crna
(1–2 µg µl−1 ) and incubated for 24–48 h at 18◦ c. after
four surgeries, the frogs were deeply anaesthetized in
tricaine and killed by pithing. these methods of animal
handling are in accordance with the nih guidelines and
the protocol was approved by the animal use and care
committee of thomas jefferson university.
two-electrode voltage clamp

the whole-cell na+ current of oocytes expressing
 xxxg2028xxx  were recorded using a standard two-electrode
voltage clamp. oocytes are impaled with microelectrodes
(< 1 m) filled with 3 m kcl and currents recorded
using an oc-725c voltage clamp (warner instruments,
hamden, ct, usa). oocytes were held at −100 mv and
pulses generated using pclamp software (version 7,
axon instruments, foster city ca, usa). oocytes were
incubated and currents recorded in frog ringer solution
containing (mm): 116 nacl, 2 kcl, 1.8 cacl2 , 1 mgcl2 ,
5 hepes, ph 7.4. all recordings were performed at
room temperature (21–23◦ c). data are presented as the
mean ± s.e.m. curve fitting and plotting was performed
using sigmaplot (spss science, chicago, il, usa). the
recovery time courses were routinely fitted with models
having between 1 and 3 exponential components. the
model that provided the best approximation of the data
with the fewest number of free parameters was reported.
in all cases, the recovery time course of the wild-type
and mutant channels were fitted with the same model.
 xxxd2113xxx  was purchased from sigma chemical.

single amino acid substitutions were made using the
quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene
inc., la jolla, ca, usa). a fragment (1–2 kb)
encompassing the mutation site was excised and subcloned
into pcdna (invitrogen). complementary pairs of
mutagenic oligonucleotides (22–29 bp) containing the
appropriate nucleotide substitutions were prepared at
the nucleic acid facility, kimmel cancer center
(jefferson medical college, philadelphia, pa, usa). these
oligonucleotides were subsequently used as primers for
synthesis of both strands of the plasmid. we used 20 ng
of cdna plasmid as template, 5 u pfu dna polymerase
(stratagene), primers, and free nucleotides in a total
volume of 100 µl. after strand synthesis (≈20 cycles),
10 u of dpn i was added to the reaction mixture to
selectively digest the original template (37◦ c, 1–2 h).
the restriction endonuclease was heat inactivated (65◦ c,
15 min), and the mixture used to transform dh5alpha bacteria
by electroporation. base substitutions were confirmed by
automated dna sequencing. dna fragments (1–2 kb)
carrying the mutation were then subcloned into wild-type
 xxxg2028xxx  or non-inactivating (qqq) mutant background.

a, use-dependent inhibition was induced by applying a train of 100
depolarizing pulses (−10 mv, 20 ms) at a frequency of 10 hz. the
currents were measured before (control) and 5 min after application
of  xxxd2113xxx  (2.5–100 µm). b, the steady-state current measured after
100 pulses (i100 /i1 ) in the presence of  xxxd2113xxx  was normalized to the

(use-dependent). also plotted is the resting block determined from
single depolarizing pulses (−10 mv, 20 ms) applied at 60 s intervals
from a holding potential of −120 mv (resting block). the continuous
curves are a fit to the hill equation [(i/io = (1 + ([flec]/ic50 )(n )−1 ]
where i and io are the control and drug-modified current amplitudes
and n is the hill coefficient. the ic50 and n values are 7.4 ± 0.6 µm

applying  xxxd2113xxx  (10 µm) while stimulating at a low
frequency (60 s intervals) resulted in a negligible (∼2%)
reduction in the peak current amplitude. because the
currents were elicited by brief depolarizations from a
negative holding potential suggests that  xxxd2113xxx  does not
appreciably bind to the channels under resting conditions.
increasing the frequency of stimulation typically enhances
the inhibition produced by local anaesthetics, which
appear to preferentially bind to the open or inactivated
states of the channel. in the absence of drug, the peak
current amplitudes of  xxxg2028xxx  are only slightly reduced
by a train of depolarizing pulses applied at a frequency
of 10 hz (fig. 1a). following treatment with  xxxd2113xxx

a,  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition was induced by applying 100 depolarizing
pulses (−10 mv, 20 ms) at a frequency of 10 hz. the voltage was then
returned to −100 mv for a variable duration (0.025–180 s) before
applying a standard test pulse (−10 mv, 20 ms). the peak current
amplitudes (i) elicited by test pulses were normalized to the current
measured after a prolonged rest (180 s) at −100 mv (io ) and plotted
versus the recovery interval. the continuous curves are fits to either a
single or biexponential function [i/io = 1 − (a1 (t/tau 1 ) + a2 (t/tau 2 )] where
tau and a are the time constants and the corresponding relative
amplitudes. the data had time constants (relative amplitude) of
2.5 ± 0.3 s (a = 0.11 ± 0.01) for the control (n = 12),
tau 1 = 0.7 ± 0.2 s (a1 = 0.04 ± 0.01) and tau 2 = 75.3 ± 4.5 s
(a2 = 0.47 ± 0.01) for 10 µm (n = 5), and tau 1 = 0.4 ± 0.1 s
(a1 = 0.02 ± 0.02) and tau 2 = 81.3 ± 3.2 s (a2 = 0.75 ± 0.01) for
25 µm  xxxd2113xxx  (n = 6). b, channels were inactivated by applying 1 or
10 s depolarizing pulses to −10 mv before returning to −100 mv for
a variable duration (1 ms–30 s). a standard test pulse (−10 mv, 20 ms)
was used to assay the fractional current (i), which was normalized to
the current measured after holding at −100 mv for 120 s (io ) and
plotted versus the recovery interval (t). the continuous curves are fits
of the data to either the sum of three exponential components
[i/io = 1 − (a1 exp(− t/tau 1 ) + a2 exp(− t/tau 2 ) + a3 exp(− t/tau 3 ))] where

block measured by briefly depolarizing at 60 s intervals,
which had an ic50 of 345 µm. the relatively weak
inhibition of resting channels and the significant increase
induced by rapid repetitive depolarization are consistent
with the preferential binding of  xxxd2113xxx  to activated
(i.e. open or inactivated) states of the channel.
to further investigate the state dependence of  xxxd2113xxx 
binding we determined the steady-state use-dependent
inhibition for voltages between −70 and 0 mv. the
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition after 100 depolarizing pulses was
determined and the fractional inhibition plotted versus
the test voltage (fig. 1c). the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition
progressively increased with depolarization reaching
a maximal of ∼75% at voltages more depolarized
than −10 mv. the continuous curve is a fit of
the data to a boltzmann function with a midpoint
(v 0.5 ) for the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition of −42 mv. also
plotted is the normalized conductance versus voltage
relationship of  xxxg2028xxx  measured in the presence of
 xxxd2113xxx  (v 0.5 = −36 ± 0.9 mv, n = 4), which was not
significantly different from that of the drug-free controls
(v 0.5 = −38 ± 1.3 mv, n = 6, data not shown). the
extensive overlap of voltage-dependent activation with the
development of  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition is consistent with
preferentially binding of the drug to activated states of
the channel.
recovery from  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition

the progressive decrease in the amplitude of the test
currents observed during rapid repetitive depolarization
indicates that channels that bind  xxxd2113xxx  during the
20 ms depolarizations do not fully recover during the
80 ms hyperpolarization between pulses (fig. 1a). this
was not observed in the absence of the  xxxd2113xxx ,
suggesting that drug binding may slow the recovery of
 xxxg2028xxx  at hyperpolarized voltages. we investigated the
underlying mechanism by directly measuring the time
course of recovery from  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition.  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition was induced by applying a train of 100
depolarizing prepulses at a frequency of 10 hz. the voltage
was then returned to −100 mv for a variable duration
(0.025–180 s) before applying a standard test pulse to
assay the extent of the recovery. the test currents were
normalized to those measured after a prolonged rest at the
holding voltage (> 180 s) and plotted versus the recovery
interval (fig. 2a). in the absence of drug, a small reduction
in the test current was observed that recovered with a time
constant of 2.5 s. this appears to reflect the recovery of
a small fraction of the channels (11%) that had entered
slow inactivated states during repetitive depolarization.
after application of  xxxd2113xxx  (25 µm), the steady-state
inhibition induced by the depolarizing prepulses increased
by 7-fold and the recovery time course was found to
be biexponential with time constants of 0.4 s and 81 s,

respectively. the slow component constitutes the majority
(97%) of the time course and reflects the recovery of the
drug-modified channels. this slow recovery appears to
underlie the potent use-dependent inhibition produced
by  xxxd2113xxx  (fig. 1a).
to further investigate the state dependence of the
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition we examined the recovery of the
control and drug-modified channels after applying single
long depolarizing conditioning pulse (−10 mv, 1 s) rather
than the brief repetitive pulses used to induce the
use-dependent inhibition. although the channels briefly
open at the beginning of these prolonged depolarizations,
the channels rapidly inactivate (tau ≈ 5 ms) and do not
reopen during the remainder of the pulse. the majority
of the inhibition observed in these experiments therefore
reflects  xxxd2113xxx  binding to inactivated channels.
although  xxxd2113xxx  (10 µm) caused a small fraction
(< 10%) of the channels to slowly recover (tau = 9 s), the
majority of the channels recovered with time constants and
relative amplitudes that are similar to those of drug-free
controls (fig. 2b). we considered the possibility that
 xxxd2113xxx  may bind with low affinity or that the onset
of the drug inhibition may be slow when the channels are
inactivated. however, increasing the prepulse duration to
10 s or the applied concentration of  xxxd2113xxx  from 10
to 25 µm resulted in little change in the recovery time
course by comparison to the drug-free controls (table 1).
the data indicate that simply stabilizing the channels
in inactivated conformations fails to promote significant
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition. this sharply contrasts with rapid
repetitive pulsing, which produces a comparatively large
inhibition at lower concentrations of the drug (fig. 1)
and dramatically slows the recovery when the channels
are returned to a hyperpolarized potential (fig. 2a).
overall, the data indicate that opening of the channels
is an important determinant of  xxxd2113xxx  binding and
that at low concentrations (≤ 25 µm) the drug does not
appreciably interact with the closed (fig. 1b) or inactivated
(fig. 2b) states of the channel.

 xxxd2113xxx  binding to open channels

opening of the  xxxg2028xxx  channel appears to play
a prominent role in the use-dependent inhibition


produced by  xxxd2113xxx . unfortunately, at depolarizing
voltages  xxxg2028xxx  channels only briefly open (< 1 ms)
before inactivating, significantly complicating the
characterization of  xxxd2113xxx  interaction with the open
states (o’leary et al. 1995). we further investigated
the role of the open state in  xxxd2113xxx  binding using
a non-inactivating mutant of  xxxg2028xxx . this mutant
was constructed by replacing hydrophobic residues
(i485, f1486, m1487) of the interdomain d3–d4
linker of the channel with glutamines (ifm→qqq)
(west et al. 1992). in the absence of drug, the qqq
mutant channels open normally at depolarized voltages
and display minimal inactivation during 400 ms of
depolarization (fig. 3a).  xxxd2113xxx  (1–25 µm) induced
a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of the
current decay that was biexponential, with the rapid
component (tau f ) reflecting the time course of the  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition. assuming a simple bimolecular interaction
predicts that the blocking rate (1/tau f ) should increase
linearly with the drug concentration where the slope
and y-intercept represent the association (k on ) and
dissociation (k off ) rate constants, respectively (o’leary &
chahine, 2002). the plot of the blocking rate versus the
 xxxd2113xxx  concentration is well fitted by a straight line
with an equilibrium binding constant (k d = k off /k on ) of
10.8 µm (fig. 3b and table 2).
to further investigate the underlying mechanism, we
examined the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition of the qqq mutant
after reducing the external concentration of na+ to 50%
by iso-osmotically replacing nacl with choline chloride.
the  xxxd2113xxx -induced current decay was fitted with
exponentials and the blocking rate (1/tau f ) plotted versus the

recovery of  xxxg2028xxx  at hyperpolarized voltages (fig. 2a).
the slow dissociation of  xxxd2113xxx  from either closed or
inactivated states could account for the use-dependent
inhibition of the channels. we further investigated
the underlying mechanisms using the non-inactivating
(qqq) mutant, which enabled us to selectively examine
the time course of recovery from closed states (o’leary
et al. 2003). depolarizing prepulses (−10 mv, 100 ms)
were used to induce the  xxxd2113xxx  block of the open
channels. the voltage was then returned to −100 mv for
variable intervals before applying a standard test pulse to
assay availability. the test currents were normalized to
those measured after a prolonged rest (120 s) at −100 mv
and plotted versus the recovery interval (fig. 4). in the
absence of drug, ∼3% of the qqq current inactivated
during the depolarizing prepulse and recovered with a
time constant (tau ) of 9.2 s.  xxxd2113xxx  (25 µm) induced a
10-fold increase in the fraction of current inhibited during
the depolarizing prepulse and increased the recovery time
constant (tau = 42.4 s). because the qqq mutant channels
do not inactivate suggests that deactivation either traps
 xxxd2113xxx  within the pore or otherwise causes the drug to
slowly dissociate from the channel.
mutations near the n-terminus of the d4s6 have
been shown to facilitate the binding of externally applied
quaternary analogues of anaesthetics (ragsdale et al. 1994;

pathway for these membrane-impermeant compounds
that facilitates the interaction of the externally applied
drug with the cytoplasmic d4s6 binding site (ragsdale
et al. 1994; sunami et al. 2001). we further investigated
the untrapping mechanism by transferring the i1756c
mutation to the non-inactivating (qqq) mutant background (fig. 4). in the absence of drug, 3% of the mutant
channels inactivated and recovered with a time constant
of 11.9 s.  xxxd2113xxx  increased the inhibition produced by
the depolarizing prepulse 20-fold, and the drug-modified
channels recovered with a time constant of 7.4 s. despite
the large increase in the relative amplitude of the inhibited
current, the subsequent recovery time course was similar
to the drug-free control and 6-fold faster than the recovery
of the qqq channel (tau = 42 s). the rapid recovery of the
qqq-i1756c mutant suggests that the slow diffusion of
 xxxd2113xxx  out of the pore may be the rate-limiting step in
the recovery when the channels are closed.
in addition to accelerating the kinetics of closed-state
untrapping, the i1756c mutation increased the amplitude
of the slowly recovering component (aqqq-i1756c = 0.59
versus aqqq = 0.31) (fig. 4). we speculated that this
increase in the fraction of i1756c mutant channels
inhibited during the depolarizing prepulse might reflect
differences in the tonic  xxxd2113xxx  block of the channel
under resting conditions. to test this we directly compared
the peak current amplitudes of the qqq mutant
current by applying depolarizing test pulses (−10 mv,
400 ms) at 2 min intervals immediately before and after
applying 25 µm  xxxd2113xxx .  xxxd2113xxx  inhibited the qqq
and qqq-i1756c channels by 27 ± 0.5% (n = 8) and
8.4 ± 1.6% (n = 11), respectively. the i1756c mutation
significantly reduced the tonic block of the qqq mutant.
assuming a single common  xxxd2113xxx  binding site for both
the closed and open channels, predicts that a larger fraction
of the i1756c channels will be unoccupied at rest and
therefore available for  xxxd2113xxx  block as the channels open
at depolarized voltages. the data suggest that closed-state
untrapping may be an important determinant of both the
recovery kinetics and the steady-state  xxxd2113xxx  block of
the channels under resting conditions.
an alternative explanation for the rapid recovery and
weak resting block of the qqq-i1756c channel is that this

channel. the time course of the current decay was fitted
with the sum of two exponentials and the blocking rate
(1/tau f ) was plotted versus the  xxxd2113xxx  concentration
(fig. 5b). the i1756c mutation reduced both k on and k off
by comparison to the control qqq channel (table 2). also
plotted is the steady-state inhibition measured near the end
of the 400 ms depolarizing pulses, which was well fitted by a
single site model with a k d of 8.5 µm (fig. 5c). if  xxxd2113xxx 
binding is an important determinant of the recovery
from closed states then the reduced k off predicts slower
recovery of the qqq-i1756c mutant by comparison to
the qqq channel. this is opposite of what we observed
experimentally (fig. 4a) and is therefore inconsistent with
an important role for  xxxd2113xxx  binding in the recovery of
the qqq mutant. rather the i1756c mutation appears to
accelerate the recovery by permitting  xxxd2113xxx  to rapidly
escape from the pore when the channel is closed, similar
to what we recently described for cocaethylene (o’leary
et al. 2003).

a, the recovery time course of the rapidly inactivating wild type and
i1756c mutant were measured by applying 100 depolarizing pulses at
a frequency of 10 hz. the voltage was then returned to −120 mv for
a variable interval (0.02–90 s) before applying a standard test pulse
(−10 mv, 20 ms). the amplitude of the test current was normalized to
controls measured after 180 s rest at the holding potential and plotted
versus the recovery interval. in the absence of drug the recovery of the
wild type (n = 9) and i1756c mutant (n = 5) was biexponential with
time constants (relative amplitude) of tau f = 0.39 ± 0.10 s
(af = 0.13 ± 0.01) and tau s = 10.3 ± 4.2 s (as = 0.06 ± 0.01). after
application of  xxxd2113xxx  (10 µm) the wild type had tau f = 1.2 ± 0.1 s
(af = 0.10 ± 0.005) and tau s = 127.6 ± 8.8 s (as = 0.44 ± 0.004)
(n = 7). for the i1756c mutant the time constants were
tau f = 0.10 ± 0.03 s (af = 0.09 ± 0.01) and tau s = 12.6 ± 0.4 s
(as = 0.50 ± 0.01) after application of  xxxd2113xxx  (n = 5). b, recovery
time course of the i1756c mutation. the recovery was determined by
first applying a 10 s depolarizing pulse to −10 mv. the recovery time
course (1 ms–60 s) was assessed using a standard test pulse. test
currents were normalized to controls measured after 120 s of rest at
−120 mv. the continuous curves are biexponential curve fits with time
constants (relative amplitude) of tau f = 0.03 ± 0.005 s
(af = 0.47 ± 0.03) and tau s = 1.1 ± 0.1 s (as = 0.50 ± 0.03) for
controls (n = 3); tau f = 0.05 ± 0.009 s (af = 0.45 ± 0.03) and
tau s = 2.2 ± 0.3 s (as = 0.52 ± 0.03) after application of 25 µm
 xxxd2113xxx  (n = 3).

the i1756c mutation facilitated the closed-state
untrapping of  xxxd2113xxx  from the non-inactivating
mutant (fig. 4). we were therefore interested in
determining if the i1756c mutation similarly altered the
recovery of rapidly inactivating channels. the recovery
time course of the wild type and i1756c mutant was
determined by first applying a series of 100 depolarizing
pulses at a frequency of 10 hz to promote  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition. the voltage was returned to the holding
potential for a variable interval before applying a standard
test pulse to assay availability. in the absence of drug,
19% of the i1756c mutant channels inactivated and
recovered with fast (tau f ) and slow (tau s ) time constants
of tau f = 0.4 s (af = 0.13) and tau s = 10.3 s (as = 0.06)
(fig. 6a).  xxxd2113xxx  increased the fraction of slowly
recovering channels to 59% by selectively increasing
the relative amplitude (as = 0.50) and time constant
(tau s = 12.6 s) of the slow component. this contrasts with
the recovery of the drug-modified wild type measured
under identical conditions, which had time constants of
tau f = 1.2 s and tau s = 128 s, respectively (fig. 6a). although
the recovery of the i1756c mutant is slow by comparison
to the drug-free controls, it is 10-fold faster than that of
the wild-type channel. the i1756c mutation accelerated
the recovery of drug-modified channels similar to what
was observed for the non-inactivating qqq mutant
(fig. 4). untrapping of  xxxd2113xxx  appears to be the
rate-limiting step in the recovery of both closed and
inactivated channels.
a recent study indicated that  xxxd2113xxx  binding to
inactivated states of na+ channels is slow (tau = 8 s)
(wang et al. 2003), which may explain the relatively
weak  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition produced by long depolarizing

mechanisms of  xxxd2113xxx  trapping

pulses (fig. 2b). binding of the native inactivation gate
to its receptor located near the internal mouth of the
channel is believed to occlude the pore and may prevent
 xxxd2113xxx  from rapidly accessing its binding site. the
finding that the i1756c mutant creates an alternative
pathway for  xxxd2113xxx  diffusion that accelerates closedand inactivated-state untrapping, raises the possibility that
this mutation may also facilitate the direct binding of
 xxxd2113xxx  to inactivated channels. to test this we applied
long depolarizing conditioning pulses (−10 mv, 10 s) to
stabilize the i1756c mutant in inactivated conformations
and to promote  xxxd2113xxx  binding. the voltage was
then returned to the holding potential and the recovery
time course was measured using a standard test pulse.
the recovery of the i1756c mutant measured in the
presence of  xxxd2113xxx  was not substantially different from
the drug-free control (fig. 6b). despite creating a pathway
that enhances drug access to the cytoplasmic binding
site,  xxxd2113xxx  did not appear to appreciably bind at
depolarized voltages where the channels are inactivated.
reduced access to the cytoplasmic binding site induced by
rapid inactivation cannot account for the weak  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition of the i1756c mutant. rather these findings
suggest that the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition rapidly dissipates
when the voltage is returned to a hyperpolarized potential,
a result that is inconsistent with high-affinity binding to
inactivated states.
discussion
in this study, we investigated the state-dependent binding
of  xxxd2113xxx  to human cardiac ( xxxg2028xxx ) na+ channels
expressed in xenopus oocytes. while briefly depolarizing
from a negative holding potential,  xxxd2113xxx  produced
a relatively low affinity inhibition (ic50 = 345 µm)
indicating that the drug weakly binds under resting
conditions where the channels are predominately closed
(fig. 1b). increasing the frequency of stimulation
enhanced the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition (ic50 = 7.4 µm), which
progressively increased over the range of voltages where
the channels activated (fig. 1c). these data suggest
that  xxxd2113xxx  preferentially interacts with the open
or inactivated states of the channel. unfortunately, the
repetitive pulsing protocols necessary to induce the
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition causes the channels to rapidly
cycle through the open and inactivated conformations
complicating attempts to directly identify the state(s)
important for drug binding. we further investigated the
state dependence of binding by applying depolarizing
pulses that effectively stabilized the channels in inactivated
conformations (fig. 2b). these long depolarizations failed
to promote significant  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition, suggesting
that direct binding to inactivated states is not an
important determinant of the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition.
rather the potent use-dependent inhibition induced


by repetitive depolarization, the voltage sensitivity of
the inhibition, and the relatively weak inhibition of
closed (fig. 1b) and inactivated channels (fig. 2b)
indicates that channel opening plays a prominent
role in drug binding (liu et al. 2002; wang et al.
2003).
 xxxd2113xxx  binding to the open state was further
investigated using a non-inactivating (qqq) mutant
of  xxxg2028xxx .  xxxd2113xxx  produced a rapid time-dependent
decay in the otherwise slow inactivating current of the
qqq mutant (fig. 3a). the majority of the  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition occurred after the channels had open and
displayed concentration dependence consistent with a
simple bimolecular interaction of the drug with its binding
site (grant et al. 2000; o’leary & chahine, 2002).
lowering the external concentration of na+ altered the
association and dissociation rate constants of  xxxd2113xxx 
binding (fig. 3b) and potentiated the steady-state
inhibition (fig. 3c). the reduction in k off suggests that
na+ and  xxxd2113xxx  compete for distinct but functionally
overlapping binding sites within the pore (o’leary
& chahine, 2002). the strong dependence of the
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition on channel opening, bimolecular
binding kinetics, and competition with na+ ions for
pore binding sites are consistent with an open-channel
blocking mechanism.  xxxd2113xxx  appears to preferentially
gain access to its cytoplasmic binding site located
within the pore by entering through the internal aqueous pathway created by the opening of
the channel. occupancy of this cytoplasmic site by
 xxxd2113xxx  blocks the pore resulting in the inhibition of
na+ current.
deactivation and inactivation slows the recovery
from  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition

 xxxd2113xxx  substantially slows the recovery of  xxxg2028xxx 
channels (tau = 81 s) by comparison to drug-free controls
(tau = 2.5 s), which appears to account for the potent
use-dependent inhibition produced by this drug (fig. 1a).
our data indicate that during repetitive depolarization,
 xxxd2113xxx  rapidly binds to the open channels, and that
subsequent gating transitions further potentiate the
inhibition and slow the recovery at hyperpolarized
voltages. several mechanisms have been proposed to
account for the slow recovery of na+ channels that are
modified by local anaesthetics. inactivation is believed
to induce conformational changes near the cytoplasmic
mouth of na+ channels that increases the affinity of
anaesthetic binding (hille, 1977; hondeghem & katzung,
1977). the slow dissociation of anaesthetics from a
high-affinity binding site could be the rate-limiting step in
the recovery of the drug-modified channels. alternatively,
anaesthetics could become trapped within the channel as
the activation or inactivation gates close (starmer et al.

46

e. ramos and m. e. o’leary

1984). drug that rapidly accesses the cytoplasmic binding
site when the channel is open may escape via an inherently
slower pathway when the cytoplasmic aqueous pathway
is occluded by the activation or inactivation gates. in
this case, the recovery of drug-modified channels may be
more closed linked to the diffusion of anaesthetics out
of the channel rather than the slow dissociation from a
high-affinity binding site.
we further investigated these potential mechanisms
by examining the recovery of the non-inactivating
(qqq) mutant channels (fig. 4). in the presence of
 xxxd2113xxx , the recovery of the qqq mutant at hyperpolarized voltages was slow (tau = 42 s) by comparison
to the drug-free controls (tau = 9 s). assuming that
at low concentrations (≤ 25 µm)  xxxd2113xxx  does not
bind to closed channels provides an estimate of the
rate of  xxxd2113xxx  dissociation from the closed channel
(1/tau rec = 0.02 s−1 ) that is three orders of magnitude
slower than the dissociation rate constant directly
determined from open-channel blocking experiments
(fig. 3, k off = 31 s−1 ). conformational changes that occur
as the qqq channels are returned to a hyperpolarized
potential stabilize the  xxxd2113xxx  block (grant et al. 2000;
wang et al. 2003). because fast inactivation has been
disabled by the qqq mutations suggests that closing
of the activation gate at hyperpolarized voltages trapped
 xxxd2113xxx  within the pore.
we used the i1756c mutation to further investigate
the mechanism(s) underlying the slow recovery from
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition. homologous mutations in neuronal
and skeletal muscle na+ channels potentiate the inhibition
produced by externally applied quaternary analogues of
anaesthetics by creating an alternative access pathway that
facilitates the binding of these membrane-impermeant
compounds when the channels are closed (ragsdale et al.
1994; qu et al. 1995; lee et al. 2001; sunami et al.
2001). we found that the recovery of the drug-modified
qqq-i1756c mutant (tau = 7.4 s) was 6-fold faster than
that of the qqq channel (tau = 42 s). when expressed in
the non-inactivating background, the i1756c mutation
accelerated the recovery from  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition. the
more rapid recovery of the qqq-i1756c mutant cannot
be attributed to a simple weakening of  xxxd2113xxx  binding
because the affinity is not altered by the i1756c mutation
(table 2). rather the i1756c mutation appears to facilitate
 xxxd2113xxx  escape from the pore when the channel is
closed. slow untrapping of  xxxd2113xxx  from within the pore
appears to be the rate-limiting step in the recovery of
the non-inactivating mutant channels. channel opening
enhances  xxxd2113xxx  binding and deactivation traps the
drug within the channel. these data are consistent with
a model in which the activation gate acts as an effective
barrier that regulates  xxxd2113xxx  access to and escape from
its cytoplasmic binding site.

j physiol 560.1

at physiological ph (7.4),  xxxd2113xxx  is positively
charged (99%), which may account for its strong
preference for accessing the cytoplasmic binding site
via the hydrophilic aqueous pathway of open channels
rather than the hydrophobic routes used by uncharged
anaesthetics (liu et al. 2003). the interdomain d3–d4
linker of na+ channels is believed to act as a ‘hinged lid’
that binds to the internal mouth of the channel during
inactivation and inhibits na+ permeation (west et al.
1992). the weak  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition induced by long
depolarizing conditioning pulses (fig. 2b) suggests that
when closed the inactivation gate prevents  xxxd2113xxx  from
readily access its binding site via the internal aqueous
pathway (liu et al. 2002; wang et al. 2003). although rapid
inactivation does not directly promote  xxxd2113xxx  binding,
inactivation significantly contributes to the slow recovery
of drug-modified channels at hyperpolarized voltages. for
example, the closed-state untrapping of  xxxd2113xxx  from the
non-inactivating qqq mutant (tau = 42 s) is more rapid
then the recovery of the inactivating wild type (tau = 81 s).
this raises the possibility that rapid inactivation may slow
the recovery by trapping  xxxd2113xxx  within the channel
(courtney, 1975). alternatively, high-affinity binding of
 xxxd2113xxx  could bias the gating equilibrium toward stable
inactivated states thereby contributing to the slow recovery
of the channels (liu et al. 2002; wang et al. 2003).
we found that the recovery of the drug-modified
i1756c mutant (tau i1756c = 12.6 s) was rapid by comparison
to the wild type (tau = 81 s) and displayed kinetics
surprisingly similar to the closed-state untrapping from
the qqq-i1756c mutant (tau qqq-i1756c = 7.4 s). creating a
pathway that enables the rapid escape of  xxxd2113xxx  from
the channel accelerated the recovery from both closed
and inactivated states. this is substantially different from
what we previously observed for the inhibition of  xxxg2028xxx 
by cocaethylene, a metabolite of cocaine and ethanol
(o’leary et al. 2003). in that study, the i1756c mutation
selectively facilitated the recovery from the closed but
not the inactivated state. the data indicated that despite
enabling rapid untrapping, the recovery of the i1756c
mutant remained slow because of enhanced cocaethylene
binding to inactivated states, a result that is consistent
with the predictions of the modulated receptor hypothesis
(hille, 1977; hondeghem & katzung, 1977). our current
finding that the i1756c mutation caused the  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition to rapidly dissipate in both the inactivating and
non-inactivating mutants argues against a mechanism in
which  xxxd2113xxx  is tightly bound when the channels are
inactivated. this is further supported by data showing
that prolonged depolarizations that stabilize channels
in inactivated states failed to promote the  xxxd2113xxx 
inhibition of the i1756c mutant (fig. 6b). unlike the
wild type, reduced access of  xxxd2113xxx  to the binding site
when the channels are inactivated cannot account for

mechanisms of  xxxd2113xxx  trapping

the weak inhibition of the i1756c mutant. these data
support the conclusion that  xxxd2113xxx  inhibits  xxxg2028xxx  by a
mechanism that does not require high-affinity binding to
inactivated states of the channel. rather the data suggest
that deactivation and rapid inactivation potentiate the
inhibition and slow the recovery by trapping  xxxd2113xxx 
within the pore. these findings are consistent with a
‘guarded receptor’ mechanism in which the channel gates
regulate  xxxd2113xxx  access to the cytoplasmic binding site
(starmer et al. 1984).
mechanisms of state-dependent  xxxd2113xxx 
binding and inhibition

previous studies of the state-dependent binding of
 xxxd2113xxx  to na+ channels generally support a mechanism
in which channel opening is an important step in  xxxd2113xxx 
binding (anno & hondeghem, 1990; nitta et al. 1992; qu
et al. 1995; ragsdale et al. 1996; nagatomo et al. 2000;
liu et al. 2002; wang et al. 2003). this is consistent with
our data showing that  xxxd2113xxx  preferentially accesses the
cytoplasmic binding site of  xxxg2028xxx  by entering through
the aqueous pathway of open channels. however, recent
work suggests that  xxxd2113xxx  may inhibit na+ channels
by directly binding to inactivated states (viswanathan
et al. 2001; desaphy et al. 2004). we found that at
low concentrations (≤ 25 µm),  xxxd2113xxx  failed to inhibit
during sustained depolarization where the channels are
predominately inactivated (fig. 2b). this contrasts with
repetitive pulsing protocols that significantly inhibited
the current (75%) under identical conditions (fig. 1).
these findings are inconsistent with an important role
for the direct binding of  xxxd2113xxx  to inactivated states of
the channel. at high concentrations (100 µm),  xxxd2113xxx 
binding to inactivated channels has been reported but
the onset of this inhibition is slow and therefore deemed
unlikely to significantly contribute to the inhibition
produced by short depolarizing pulses (wang et al. 2003).
overall, our data support the conclusions of previous
studies indicating that  xxxd2113xxx  inhibits na+ channels
by preferentially binding to the open state.
although na+ channel opening clearly promotes
 xxxd2113xxx  binding, the mechanism of inhibition remains
controversial. a recent study reported that although
channel opening contributes to  xxxd2113xxx  binding, the
drug does not appear to act by a pore blocking mechanism
(liu et al. 2002). this contrasts with studies showing
that  xxxd2113xxx  reduces single-channel open times (grant
et al. 2000) and causes a time-dependent decay in the
current of non-inactivating mutant channels (wang et al.
2003), both of which are consistent with the  xxxd2113xxx 
block of open channels. the voltage sensitivity of the
 xxxd2113xxx  inhibition (fig. 1c), simple binding kinetics
(fig. 3b) and sensitivity to changes in the concentration of
external na+ (fig. 3b,c) are in good agreement with the


predictions of a pore blocking mechanism. in addition,
the steady-state inhibition of  xxxg2028xxx  (fig. 1b) and the
qqq mutant (fig. 3c) display similar concentration
dependence, suggesting that open-channel block may
underlie the  xxxd2113xxx  inhibition of both the inactivating
and the non-inactivating channels.
our data are consistent with previous studies indicating
that  xxxd2113xxx  preferentially gains access to its binding
site when the channels are open and that inhibition of
the channel is further potentiated by rapid inactivation
(liu et al. 2002; wang et al. 2003). these findings have
been interpreted within the framework of the modulated
receptor hypothesis in which anaesthetics are believed
to bind with high affinity to the inactivated states
of the channel (hille, 1977; hondeghem & katzung,
1977). in this model, the recovery of drug-modified
channels is determined by the interplay between the
slow dissociation of  xxxd2113xxx  from its high-affinity
binding site and the recovery from inactivation. although
our data are consistent with an important role for
rapid inactivation in the slow recovery of drug-modified
channels, it is inconsistent with high-affinity binding
to inactivated states. the slow dissociation of  xxxd2113xxx 
from a high-affinity binding site does not appear to be
the rate-limiting step in the recovery of drug-modified
channels. rather our data suggest that when shut the
activation and inactivation gates act as effective barriers
that prevent the rapid escape of the positively charged
 xxxd2113xxx  from its binding site located within the
pore. cooperative interaction between these gates in the
drug-modified channel appears to potentiate  xxxd2113xxx 
trapping within the pore resulting in the slow recovery
of the  xxxg2028xxx  channel at hyperpolarized voltages. it is
known that na+ channels must first deactivate prior
to recovering from inactivation (kuo & bean, 1994).
 xxxd2113xxx  may alter deactivation or disrupt the coupling
between closing and recovery resulting in channels that
remain persistently blocked and inactivated at hyperpolarized voltages. alternatively,  xxxd2113xxx  occupancy of
the pore may alter the voltage-dependent gating causing
the channels to become locked in a non-conducting
conformation (sheets & hanck, 2003). additional studies
of  xxxd2113xxx  untrapping from closed and inactivated
channels will provide new insight into the mechanisms
of local anaesthetic inhibition.
