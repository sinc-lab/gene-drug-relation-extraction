abstract
the anabolic steroid  xxxd2806xxx  is increasingly used to preserve or restore muscle mass in those with hiv infection or serious burns.
these effects are mediated, in part, by the  xxxg183xxx  (ar). anti-glucocorticoid effects have also been reported for some anabolic
steroids, and the goal of our studies was to determine whether  xxxd2806xxx  had a similar mechanism of action. studies with in vitro
translated  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), however, showed no inhibition of cortisol binding by  xxxd2806xxx . conversely, experiments in
cell culture systems demonstrated significant antagonism of cortisol-induced transcriptional activation by  xxxd2806xxx  in cells expressing
both the ar and gr. inhibition was not overcome by increased cortisol concentration, and no inhibition by  xxxd2806xxx  was observed
in cells expressing gr alone, confirming that non-competitive mechanisms were involved. ar-dependent repression of transcriptional
activation by  xxxd2806xxx  was also observed with the synthetic glucocorticoids dexamethasone and methylprednisolone. furthermore,
the ar antagonists 2-hydroxyflutamide and dde also repressed gr transactivation in an ar-dependent manner. a mutant ar lacking a
functional nuclear localization signal (ar4rkm ) was active in  xxxd2806xxx -mediated repression of gr even though  xxxd2806xxx -bound
ar4rkm failed to enter the nucleus and did not affect nuclear import of gr. these data indicate a novel action of  xxxd2806xxx  to suppress
glucocorticoid action via crosstalk between ar and gr.

1. introduction
anabolic steroids represent a family of synthetic androgens with tissue-selective activity. this class of medications
promotes skeletal growth, increases mass and strength of
skeletal muscle, and leads to nitrogen retention while having reduced virulizing and behavioral effects as compared to
testosterone. anabolic steroids are used increasingly to preabbreviations: ar,  xxxg183xxx ; cds, charcoal-dextran stripped
fetal bovine serum; dde, p2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane;
gfp, green fluorescent protein; gr,  xxxg1601xxx ; nls, nuclear
localization sequence; pbs, phosphate buffered saline

serve or restore skeletal muscle mass and promote wound
healing [1–3]. the anabolic steroid  xxxd2806xxx  has been
one of the most widely studied agents.  xxxd2806xxx  has been
reported to reverse the cachexia associated with hiv infection [4], and, in those with severe burns, decreases cachexia
and speeds wound healing [1,5]. in uncontrolled trials in
tetraplegic subjects,  xxxd2806xxx  appeared to improve respiratory function as measured by spirometry, and in case
studies, to promote healing of chronic pressure ulcers [6,7].
despite the increasing use of anabolic steroids, the mechanisms of action of these testosterone analogs remain incompletely defined. the assumed mechanism of action involves
binding to and activation of the  xxxg183xxx  (ar),
which is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to
the nuclear receptor superfamily. however, emerging evidence suggests that anabolic steroids may act through additional mechanisms acting in parallel with ar activation. for

example, evidence from studies of receptor binding in crude
tissue lysates indicates that some anabolic steroids, such as
nandrolone and  xxxd2631xxx , are also competitive antagonists for
the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) [8]. antagonism of the gr
is of particular interest because cortisol is required for muscle catabolism in clinical conditions such as renal failure,
and because excess glucocorticoids, whether endogenous or
exogenous, induce muscle catabolism [9,10].
despite the increasing use of  xxxd2806xxx , its ability to
antagonize corticosteroid action has not been characterized.
the experiments described herein provide evidence for a
novel, non-competitive mechanism by which  xxxd2806xxx 
blocks transcriptional activation by gr via interactions of
this receptor with  xxxd2806xxx -bound ar.

2. experimental
2.1. materials
 xxxd2806xxx  was kindly provided by savient pharmaceuticals, iselen, nj. [h3 ]-cortisol was from amersham biosciences (piscataway, nj). rabbit anti-ar antiserum was a
gift of dr. dianne m. robbins (university of michigan).
 xxxd2631xxx  was from perkin-elmer life sciences (boston, ma).
2-hydroxyflutamide was a gift from schering plough, and
dde was from sigma–aldrich (st. louis, mo).
2.2. plasmids
the xg 46 tl (gre-luc) [11] and pmmtv.luciferase
(are-luc) [12] reporters were a generous gift of dr.
micheal garabedian (new york university). the pt7-rgr
and pcmv5.rgr constructs encoding rat gr, were generously provided by dr. diane m. robbins (university of
michigan medical school), as was the 3xhre-luciferase
reporter (hre-luc). a plasmid encoding human androgen
receptor in prep4 was as described [13]. the gfp-tagged
gr construct was a generous gift of dr. william pratt (university of michigan). the construct expressing the mutant
ar defective for nuclear translocation (ar4rkm ) was a
gift from dr. elizabeth m. wilson (university of north
carolina).
2.3. in vitro translation of gr and determination of
 xxxd2806xxx  binding
rat gr mrna was synthesized with t7 polymerase
after linearization of the pt7.rgr vector by cleavage with
 xxxg2060xxx . rat gr was synthesized using this mrna by in vitro
translation using nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates
(promega, madison, wi). fifty microliter aliquots containing in vitro translated gr were then placed on ice and
used for hormone binding assays. aliquots of the translation mixture were supplemented with 1 ␮l of 1 ␮m tritiated

cortisol (20 nm final), and other additives as indicated in
the figure, then incubated on ice for 2 h. one hundred microliters of hydroxylapatite slurry containing 50% w/v in
50 mm tris–hcl ph 7.4 and 1 mm edta were added, and
translation mixtures were incubated on ice an additional
15 min with mixing every 5 min. one milliliter of wash
buffer was added (40 mm tris–hcl ph 7.4, 100 mm kcl,
1 mm edta, 1 mm egta), and the hydroxylapatite was
pelleted by centrifugation after mixing. hydroxylapatite
was washed twice with wash buffer, then hormone was
eluted with 400 ␮l of ethanol. the radioactive material in
the eluate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting
after adding 350 ␮l of the ethanol fraction to tubes containing 5 ml of ecolite liquid scintillant (icn, irvine, ca).
preliminary experiments indicated that concentrations of
gr in this system are 1 pm (yielding a ratio of ligand to
receptor in excess of 1000:1 under all conditions tested) and
that the kd for cortisol under the conditions of the assay
was 0.35 nm.
2.4. tissue culture, transfections, and luciferase assays
cv-1 and cos7 cells (american tissue type collection)
were maintained in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. for determination of effects of hormones on
expression of firefly luciferase from reporter genes, 5 × 104
cv-1 cells were seeded into wells of 24-well plates containing medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran
stripped fetal bovine serum (cds), as above. the following morning, cells were transfected with a total of 0.2 ␮g
dna per well using lipofectamine plus. after 3 h, 0.8 ml
of growth medium containing 10% cds was added and
supplemented with hormones or ethanol, as indicated in
the figures. ethanol concentrations were less than 0.2% in
all cases. after overnight incubation, cells were washed
once with pbs, after which luciferase was quantified in cell
lysates and normalized with respect to protein concentration
(lowry).
2.5. localization of ar and of gfp-tagged gr in
cultured cells
cos7 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 per well into wells
of six-well plates containing coverslips, and maintained
overnight in rpmi1640 supplemented with 10% cds. cells
were transfected as indicated in the figures using lipofectamine plus, and, 3 h after adding the transfection mixture,
cells were covered with fresh rpmi 1640 containing 10%
cds supplemented with additives as indicated in the figures. cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde, blocked
by incubation with 3% bovine  xxxg124xxx  in pbs, incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-ar, and then with texas
red conjugated goat–anti-rabbit igg (icn). coverslips
were mounted using vectashield (vector labs, burlingame,
ca), and cells were inspected by fluorescence microscopy.

2.6. measurement of cortisol binding in cultured cells
six-well plates were seeded with 5 × 105 cells per well
and maintained overnight in media supplemented with
rpmi-1640 containing 10% cds. cells were transfected
with plasmids as indicated in the figure legends, then incubated overnight in rpmi-1640 containing 10% cds.
the following morning, medium was replaced with 1 ml
per well of the same medium supplemented with tritiated
cortisol (20 nm) alone or combined with unlabeled cortisol
(2 ␮m). three hours later, cells were washed with pbs and
lysed with 200 ␮l of 2% sds. lysates were passed through
a 26 g needle to shear dna. radioactivity present in the
lysates was quantified by liquid scintillation counting and
normalized relative to protein concentrations of the lysates
as determined by the bca method (pierce, rockford, il).
the difference between counts obtained with labeled cortisol versus labeled plus unlabelled cortisol was taken as
specific binding to gr.

fig. 1. analysis of  xxxd2806xxx  binding to glucocorticoid receptors. in
vitro translated glucocorticoid receptors were incubated with tritiated
cortisol alone or in combination with unlabeled steroid hormones or their
analogs as indicated in the figure. binding of tritiated cortisol was then
determined and expressed as a percentage of that for tritiated cortisol
alone (first bar). data are mean±s.e.m. for three separate determinations.

2.7. assessment of ar mrna levels in cultured cells
total rna was extracted (rnaeasy, quiagen, valencia,
ca), treated with rnase-free dnase i (qiagen) to remove
residual genomic dna, and quantified by absorbance at
260 nm. two ␮g total rna were utilized for synthesis of
a cdna library using oligo-dt primers and an omniscript
rt kit (qiagen). analysis of human ar mrna levels was
performed using these libraries. primers for pcr were:
human ar forward, cctacggctacactcg; human ar
reverse, cagtctccaaacgcat; human  xxxg861xxx  forward, tgcaccaccaactgcttagc; human  xxxg861xxx 
reverse, ggcatggactgtggtcat. each reaction for
pcr contained 1 ␮l of a cdna library. pcr amplification was performed for 35 cycles using fasttaq (roche,
indianapolis, in).

3. results
we began our analysis by determining whether  xxxd2806xxx  competed with cortisol for binding to the gr. our
approach was based on measurement of binding of labeled
cortisol, the physiological ligand for this receptor, to gr that
had been in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates.
addition of excess unlabeled cortisol suppressed binding by
approximately 98% indicating that the assay measured primarily binding of cortisol to the gr (fig. 1). consistent
with prior reports [14], decreased cortisol binding was observed when the synthetic anabolic steroid  xxxd2631xxx  was added
(fig. 1). however,  xxxd2806xxx  had no effect on cortisol
binding at concentrations as high as 5 ␮m (fig. 1). this
concentration corresponds to the peak plasma concentration
predicted for  xxxd2806xxx  during long-term oral administration calculated from the published concentrations observed
after a single dose [15].

the gr is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which
raised the possibility that  xxxd2806xxx  could interfere with
glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional activation, as well
as binding of cortisol to the gr. interactions of  xxxd2806xxx 
with gr, or events downstream of binding of  xxxd2806xxx 
to gr, were further investigated in a cell culture system. we
utilized a transient transfection approach based on the ability of liganded gr to induce expression of firefly luciferase
under the control of a hormone response element. this analysis is sensitive to interactions at all steps from binding of
hormone to receptor through folding of luciferase. a cell line
lacking functional ar and gr would be convenient for this
analysis; cv1 cells were chosen for this purpose. to confirm
that these cells do not express functional ar or gr, we transfected them with an are-luc reporter in which expression
of luciferase is driven by the androgen and glucocorticoid
responsive mmtv promotor. expression of luciferase from
this construct is stimulated by binding of liganded ar or
gr, although gr induces about five-fold greater expression.
as shown in fig. 2a and b, when untransfected cells were
analyzed, there was no appreciable increase in luciferase activity when cells were stimulated with  xxxd2806xxx  or dihydrotestosterone (dht), and mrna for ar was present
at levels too low to detect by 35 cycles of amplification by
rt-pcr. also, cortisol elicited no luciferase expression in
these cells (fig. 2b), in which levels of mrna for gr were
very low (not shown). co-transfection with a vector encoding human ar restored androgen responsiveness associated
with a dramatic increase in levels of ar mrna detected
by rt-pcr (fig. 2a and c). co-transfection with a vector expressing gr also restored responsiveness to cortisol
(fig. 2c). the data indicate that cv1 cells contain at most
very low levels of ar and gr, and that transfection with
vectors encoding these receptors causes their expression in
adequate levels to assure activation of reporter genes.

fig. 2. characteristics of cv1 cells: (a) cv1 cells were transiently
transfected with a vector encoding ␤-galactosidase (lane 1) or human ar
(lane 2). twenty four hours later, total rna was extracted and subjected
to rt-pcr using primers for human ar or  xxxg861xxx . products formed
by pcr were analyzed after electrophoresis on agarose gels and staining
with ethidium bromide. (b) cv1 cells were transiently transfected with
the are-luc reporter and a plasmid encoding ␤-galactosidase (plasmids
were used at a 1:2 ratio then covered with growth medium supplemented
with 10% cds. cells were incubated overnight as indicated with ethanol,
cortisol (20 nm),  xxxd2806xxx  (5 ␮m) or dihydrotestosterone (dht, 5 nm).
luciferase expression was then determined and normalized for protein
concentration. data are mean values for two representative experiments
(results similar in five separate experiments) each performed in triplicate.
individual replicates were within ±10% of the mean values in each case.
(c) cells were co-transfected with the are-luc reporter together with
plasmids encoding ar and gr (ratio 1:1:1). experiments were otherwise
as in b. data are mean values for two representative experiments (results
similar among numerous experiments as shown in the subsequent figures)
each performed in triplicate. individual replicates were within ±10% of
the mean values in each case.

to test effects of  xxxd2806xxx  on activation of gr by cortisol in an intact cell system, cv-1 cells were co-transfected
with the luciferase reporter construct together with plasmids
encoding the gr and ␤-galactosidase (included as a dna
control for later comparisons). in cells expressing the gr
without the ar (fig. 3a, light gray bars),  xxxd2806xxx  alone
(5 ␮m) caused a negligible increase in luciferase activity.
more importantly, without ar present,  xxxd2806xxx  had no
effect on cortisol-induced luciferase expression. using an
intact cell system, these findings provide further evidence
against competition between  xxxd2806xxx  and cortisol for
binding to gr.

the effects of  xxxd2806xxx  in cells expressing both the
ar and gr were also examined. co-expression of ar repressed cortisol-dependent luciferase expression by, on average, about two-fold in the absence of  xxxd2806xxx  (fig. 3a,
dark gray bars). similar repression has been reported by
other investigators [16]. consistent with these prior studies,
repression was seen at gr:ar ratios from 3:1 to 1:3, with
the greatest repression occurring at ratios of 1:1 (data not
shown), arguing against competition between ar and gr for
chromatin binding. experiments in cells co-transfected with
ar and a gfp-tagged version of gr found no appreciable
inhibition of gr nuclear migration by ar (not shown). to
test for possible effects of co-expression of ar on pathways
for synthesis and maturation of gr, we characterized the
effects of co-expression of ar on binding of radiolabeled
cortisol to gr. we chose this approach because it tests levels
of functionally competent gr. the experiments compared
amounts of gr-bound cortisol in hela cells co-transfected
with gr, ␤-gal and the gre-luc compared with those for
cells transfected with gr, ar, and the gre-luc reporter.
the experiments showed that cortisol binding in cells expressing ar and gr was on average 101.2% of that for cells
expressing gr and ␤-galactosidase (average of two experiments with at least two replicates each). these data indicate
that co-expression of ar does not alter levels of functional
gr in this experimental system. taken together, the above
findings are consistent with repression by unliganded ar of
gr-mediated transactivation via a form of crosstalk.
when effects of  xxxd2806xxx  were tested on cells expressing ar and gr together with the reporter,  xxxd2806xxx 
depressed cortisol-induced luciferase expression by approximately 70% (fig. 3a, dark gray bars). to ensure that the
results could not be attributed to an unexpected property of
the gre-luciferase construct, the experiments were repeated
using two other reporter constructs. as shown in fig. 3b
(hre-luc) and fig. 3c (are-luc), experiments employing
these other reporters also showed  xxxd2806xxx -dependent
inhibition of cortisol-induced luciferase expression, but only
when ar was co-expressed with the gr. experiments testing how the relative concentrations of ar and gr affected
 xxxd2806xxx -induced repression were also performed and
revealed that the greatest repression was found at a ratio of
ar and gr plasmids of 1:1 (data not shown). when the
experiments were repeated using hela cells,  xxxd2806xxx 
also repressed cortisol-induced luciferase expression significantly (51%, s.e.m. ± 3.5%, five separate determinations)
in cells in which ar was expressed while no significant
repression was found in cells lacking ar.
the same transient transfection approach used above
was employed to test the ability of  xxxd2806xxx  to block
gr-dependent transactivation by two synthetic glucocorticoids, dexamethasone and methylprednisolone. one rationale for such studies comes from the early studies of the
ability of anabolic steroids to antagonize binding to gr
[8] in which it was shown that receptor antagonist activity
was significantly greater when dexamethasone was used as

plasmids encoding either the gr and ␤-galactosidase (open bars) or gr and ar (filled bars). the ratio of the three plasmids was 1:1:1 in each case.
cells were then covered with medium containing 10% cds. luciferase activity was determined after overnight incubation with cortisol (cort, 20 nm),
 xxxd2806xxx  (ox, 5 ␮m) or ethanol (eth, vehicle control) as indicated in the figure and expressed as arbitrary units per mg protein. data are mean ±s.e.m.

a ligand as compared to cortisol. concentrations of cortisol, dexamethasone and methylprednisolone were selected
from dose–response curves (data not shown) to yield luciferase expression corresponding to approximately 95% of
maximum in each case. as shown in fig. 4,  xxxd2806xxx 
markedly depressed luciferase expression induced by both
methylprednisolone and dexamethasone to a similar degree
as was found for cortisol, but only when the ar and gr
were both expressed.
these findings led us to ask whether the inhibition observed reflected a general property of the liganded ar, and,
whether ar antagonists might cause a similar form of sup-

pression of gr transactivation. this possibility was tested
for 2-hydroxyflutamide, a potent competitive ar antagonist, and dde, a xenobiotic agent with weak estrogenic and
anti-androgenic activity derived by environmental breakdown of ddt [17,18]. the ability of the antagonists to interfere with gr transactivation was tested in the same transient
transfection system described above. the data revealed that
both dde and 2-hydroxyflutamide significantly depressed
gr-transactivation (fig. 5). 2-hydroxyflutamide and dde
appeared to be less effective in repressing cortisol action
than  xxxd2806xxx , with dde being the least active agent in
this regard.

reporter together with plasmids encoding ar, gr or ␤-galactosidase, then
covered with medium containing 10% cds and incubated overnight with
dexamethasone (dex, 25 nm),  xxxd2806xxx  (ox, 5 ␮m) or ethanol (eth,
vehicle control) as indicated. data are mean ±s.e.m. for three determinations each performed in triplicate. () p < 0.05 vs. cortisol-treated cells
expressing gr and ␤-gal; (∗) p < 0.05 vs. cells treated with cortisol expressing gr and ar (t-test). (b) as in a except that methylprednisolone
(mp, 25 nm) was used.

to gain further insight into the mechanisms of  xxxd2806xxx  suppression of cortisol signaling we asked whether
 xxxd2806xxx  effects could be reversed by increasing cortisol
concentrations. the same transient transfection approach
employed above was used for these experiments. as shown
in fig. 6, increases in cortisol concentrations from below
physiological concentrations (20 nm) to maximal physiological concentrations (500 nm) were unable to overcome
the  xxxd2806xxx -induced inhibition of gr cells. this finding provides additional evidence that the inhibition is not
due to competition between  xxxd2806xxx  and cortisol for
binding to gr.
the non-competitive nature of the inhibition and its
dependence upon the presence of ar are consistent with
crosstalk between the two receptors. such functional interactions could occur in the cytoplasm, nucleus, or both.
this is because, in their unliganded form, both ar and
gr reside in the cytoplasm in association with molecular
chaperones, and undergo translocation to the nucleus after
binding of ligands, such as testosterone. to confirm that
 xxxd2806xxx  induced a similar nuclear translocation of ar,
the effect of  xxxd2806xxx  on ar localization was assessed
by immunocytochemistry. as shown in fig. 7a, when hormone was absent, ar was cytoplasmic and concentrated

fig. 5. inhibition of gr-mediated transactivation by ar antagonists.
(a) cv1 cells were transiently transfected with the gre-luc reporter
together with plasmids encoding the gr and ar and, after addition of
media supplemented with 10% cds, incubated overnight with cortisol

experiments. (∗) p < 0.05 vs. cells treated with cortisol alone (t-test).

in the perinuclear region.  xxxd2806xxx  induced essentially
complete migration of ar to the nucleus.
the nuclear co-localization of ar and gr, together with
reports that ar–gr receptor heterodimers are transcriptional repressors [16,19], raised the question of whether
nuclear localization of ar is needed for repression to occur.
to address this question, a version of the ar with a mutated
nuclear localization signal (ar4rkm ) was used. this mutant

and plasmids encoding ar and gr, after which medium containing 10%
cds was added together with cortisol at the concentrations shown in the
figure, and either  xxxd2806xxx  (ox, 5 ␮m) or vehicle (ethanol) as indicated in the legend. luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined
and normalized for cellular protein. data are mean ± s.e.m. for three
determinations.

or ethanol as indicated, at which time luciferase activities were determined. data are mean±s.e.m. for at least three separate experiments. (∗)

as discussed in greater detail below.  xxxd2806xxx  repressed
cortisol-induced luciferase expression significantly. similar
results were observed with 2-hydroxyflutamide and dde
(fig. 7c and d), although these agents appeared to be less effective in repressing cortisol-induced luciferase expression.
repression by  xxxd2806xxx  of gr-transactivation in
cells expressing ar4rkm could occur by at least two
mechanisms: (1) retention of gr in the cytoplasm as an
ar4rkm –gr complex; (2) formation of ar4rkm gr complexes that migrate to the nucleus (via the gr-nls) and
repress transcription. to distinguish between these possibilities, cos7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids
encoding a gfp-tagged version of the gr, and ar4rkm ,
followed by incubation with steroid hormones. cos7 cells
were used instead of cv-1 cells because of the low levels
of expression in the latter. the localization of the mutant
ar was characterized by immunocytochemistry, while that
of the gfp-gr was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.
as expected, when ar4rkm was expressed together with
a gfp-tagged version of the gr (gfp-gr), ar4rkm was
distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, both in the
absence and presence of cortisol (fig. 8a), and the gr underwent near-complete migration to the nucleus in the presence of cortisol (fig. 8b), as previously reported [20,21].
the gr remained primarily cytoplasmic in its distribution
after incubation of cells with  xxxd2806xxx  (fig. 8b). as
expected ar4rkm remained in the cytoplasm (fig. 7a)
after incubation in the presence of  xxxd2806xxx , although
some cytoplasmic ar was distributed in a punctate manner. when  xxxd2806xxx  and cortisol were co-administered,
the distribution of gfp-gr and of ar4rkm was similar to
that observed when either steroid was given alone. importantly, under these conditions nuclear import of gfp-gr
was unimpeded, and ar4rkm retained its cytoplasm localization. in cells expressing gfp-gr incubated with cortisol
and  xxxd2806xxx , cytoplasmic fluorescence was indistinguishable from that of untransfected cells, indicating that
most gr had migrated to the nucleus under these conditions. to exclude interactions that might have been missed
by this initial analysis, the fluorescence images from cells
expressing both proteins that had been treated with cortisol
and  xxxd2806xxx  were examined after merging the gfp-gr
and texas red (ar) images (fig. 8c). no evidence of
co-localization of gfp-gr and ar4rkm was evident in
these images.

4. discussion
cannot enter the nucleus but has normal hormone binding
properties [20]. cv-1 cells were transiently transfected with

reporter, then assayed for luciferase activity after exposure
to cortisol and/or  xxxd2806xxx  (fig. 7b). when used alone,
 xxxd2806xxx  did not induce luciferase expression, consistent
with the failure of the liganded receptor to enter the nucleus

anti-catabolic properties have been ascribed to anabolic
steroids based on the ability of some agents in this class
to competitively antagonize the gr and to reduce expression of corticosteroid-responsive genes in cultured cells
[8,14]. higer doses of glucocorticoids induce muscle loss,
and several lines of evidence indicate that glucocorticoids
are necessary for muscle loss to occur. adrenalectomy

blocks muscle wasting in renal failure and other disorders
[10], while ru486, a progesterone antagonist that also acts
as an antagonist of the gr, blocks muscle catabolism in
sepsis [22]. our findings indicate that  xxxd2806xxx  also
exerts anti-corticosteroid actions, but that these involve a
mechanism other than competitive antagonism of the gr
which has been previously documented for agents such
as nandrolone and  xxxd2631xxx  [8,14]. four types of evidence
support this conclusion:  xxxd2806xxx  did not block cortisol binding to the gr (fig. 1),  xxxd2806xxx  did not alter
cortisol-induced luciferase expression when ar was absent
(figs. 3 and 4),  xxxd2806xxx  effects were not overcome by
increases in cortisol concentration (fig. 4), and  xxxd2806xxx 
effects required the presence of the ar (fig. 3). another
difference between  xxxd2806xxx  effects and those for nandrolone and  xxxd2631xxx  relates to their relative abilities to block
the action of cortisol as opposed to synthetic glucocorticoids. in prior studies, both nandrolone and  xxxd2631xxx  were
much more effective in antagonizing binding of dexamethasone as opposed to cortisol [8]. by contrast,  xxxd2806xxx 
reduced transcriptional activation by each of these naturally

occurring and synthetic corticosteroids to a similar degree
when these corticosteroids were used at equivalent doses
on the dose–response curve (figs. 3 and 4).
the dependence upon ar for inhibition by  xxxd2806xxx 
of gr transactivation indicates a form of crosstalk between
ar and gr. consistent with this interpretation, androgens
and corticosteroids are well recognized as having opposing
effects on cell growth and expression of the ar [23,24]. in
addition, anabolic steroids have been shown to overcome
adverse effects of high dose corticosteroids on the diaphragm
[25], and to restore lean body mass in those with advanced
chronic obstructive lung disease (copd), of whom at least
60% were also treated with some form of corticosteroid
[26,27].
while our findings do not specifically identify a mechanisms for repression of gr-transactivation, several insights
into mechanism can be derived from these data. first, several mechanisms can be excluded. molecular chaperones
are important for folding of gr and facilitate its nuclear
import [21] and also participate in folding and activation
of ar [28,29]. evidence against competition between ar

j. zhao et al. / steroids 69 (2004) 357–366

and gr for these folding pathways was provided by the
finding that co-expression of ar had no effect on cortisol
binding to gr. findings that repression was greatest when
concentrations of plasmids for ar and gr were similar
argue against simple competition between ar and gr for
common chromatin binding sites, where ar-dependent repression of gr action should increase as the ratio of ar:gr
rises. in addition, the finding that gr nuclear import is
unimpeded by  xxxd2806xxx -bound wild-type ar argues
against interference at this step. in agreement with our
findings, ar-dependent repression of gr-transactivation
has been reported using dht as the ligand for ar [16,19].
in these reports, repression was attributed to formation of
ar–gr heterodimers. evidence for formation of such heterodimers was based upon mutational analysis showing that
repression was lost when salt bridges stabilizing dimmers
were disrupted, and on gel-shift studies performed using
the dna binding domain of each receptor. we propose that
 xxxd2806xxx  induces the formation of such heterodimers.
the finding that ar antagonists caused a similar repression of gr transactivation (fig. 5) and that ar antagonists
induce nuclear localization of ar and induce recruitment of corepressors upon chromatin binding [30] suggest
that heterodimers formed in the presence of  xxxd2806xxx 
mediate transcriptional repression via the recruitment of
co-repressors as well.
while a mechanism involving heterodimer formation is
attractive and consistent with findings in the literature, the
studies described in this report raise the possibility that the
anti-glucocorticoid actions of  xxxd2806xxx  may also involve
additional mechanisms. the major evidence supporting this
conclusion comes from the studies with the ar4rkm mutant, which showed that this variant retained the ability to
repress gr-transactivation even though the gr migrated to
the nucleus normally, leaving the mutant ar behind in the
cytoplasm (figs. 7 and 8). although the mechanisms underlying this surprising finding remain to be defined, these data
indicate that repression can occur even when the two receptors are localized in different subcellular compartments.
a leading candidate for alternative mechanisms by which
 xxxd2806xxx -bound ar could repress gr transactivation is
squelching, by competition between ar and gr for binding to transcriptional co-activators present at limiting concentrations. examples of squelching have been reported for
nuclear receptors, e.g. competition for grip-1 between estrogen and car receptors [31].
the finding that ar antagonists also repress gr-transactivation (fig. 5) is of particular interest for dde, a xenobiotic agent derived from environmental breakdown of
the insecticide ddt. dde has been found to be a weak
estrogen and anti-androgen [17,18]. exposure to dde is
linked to multiple abnormalities of sexual development
in diverse vertebrates [32,33]. our findings suggest that
adverse effects of dde and other xenobiotics capable of
binding to steroid hormone receptors may involve mechanisms beyond simple agonism or antagonism, including

365

the formation of ar–gr heterodimers with the attendant
downstream consequences. mechanisms for repression by
antagonists may be distinct from those for agonists. like
agonists, antagonists cause relocalization of ar to the nucleus and promote binding of the receptor to chromatin.
whereas agonists induce recruitment of both co-activators
and co-repressors in a context-dependent manner, antagonists appear to exclusively mediate recruitment of transcriptional co-repressors [34] which in the presence of dde may
lead to inappropriate gene silencing and endocrinological
dysfunction.
taken together, the findings presented above and in the
literature indicate that  xxxd2806xxx  has the capacity to alter
transcriptional regulation via multiple pathways. it seems
likely that  xxxd2806xxx  action involves direct modulation
of gene expression mediated through the action of the ar,
and indirect effects on transcriptional regulation involving
formation of ar–gr heterodimers. additional mechanisms
may also be involved, including squelching. we suggest that
the negative regulation of glucocorticoid-modulated gene expression by  xxxd2806xxx  represents a new paradigm for drug
mechanism. it should be noted that the anti-corticosteroid
actions of  xxxd2806xxx  described herein occur at clinically
achieved concentrations of this anabolic steroid. we propose
that anti-corticosteroid actions of  xxxd2806xxx  have important consequences for the treatment and prevention of muscle loss, and to facilitating the healing of both acute and
chronic wounds.
