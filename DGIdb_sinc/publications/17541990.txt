are map kinases drug targets?  xxxg2437xxx , but
difficult ones
simona margutti and stefan a. laufer*[a]
pharmaceutical companies are facing an increasing interest in
new target identification and validation. in particular, extensive
efforts are being made in the field of protein kinase inhibitors research and development, and the past ten years of effort in this
field have altered our perception of the potential of kinases as
drug targets. therefore, in the drug discovery process, the selection of relevant, susceptible protein kinase targets combined with
searches for leads and candidates have become a crucial approach. the success of recent launches of protein kinase inhibitors (gleevec, imatinib, sutent, iressa, nexavar,  xxxd1815xxx ) gave an-

other push to this field. numerous other kinase inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials or clinical development. some
questions are nevertheless unanswered, mostly related to the
great number of known kinases in the human genome, to their
similarity with each other, to the existence of functionally redundant kinases for specific pathways, and also because the connection between particular pathways and diseases is not always
clear. the review is leading the reader through a panoramic view
of protein kinase inhibition with a major focus on mapk, successful examples and clinical candidates.

1. introduction
the pharmaceutical industry is undoubtedly one of the world’s
largest industries and has a constantly growing market. it faces
steadily growing pressure to release more new chemical entities (nces) each year that will potentially evolve into commercial drugs and, ideally, innovative drugs with novel mechanisms of action that target therapeutic areas of unmet medical
need. these attributes summarise the short term expectations
of the upper management team of almost every pharmaceutical company. in contrast to these expectations, and despite
the steady growth of r&d investment, the field of drug discovery and development has not evolved as efficiently as expected.[1]
although most companies have increased their r&d expenditure considerably over the last few years, no notable increase
in output of nces has occurred for the industry as a whole. in
fact, the rise in r&d expenditure has been accompanied by a
steady decline in new drugs reaching the market. in 2001, the
output of the global biopharmaceutical industry in terms of
new drugs was the lowest in ten years, and the number of
fda approvals for the first half of 2006 is as low as 11. moreover, with the launch of only two or three compounds per
year against novel targets, the majority of approvals for new
drug candidates continues to be those directed against wellestablished target molecules (see figure 1).[2]
the pharmaceutical industry still suffers from two persisting
bottlenecks; one closely related to target validation, and the
other related to the overall quality of compounds in terms of
their ability to progress through the value-chain of drug development. a recent emphasis on the “front-loading” of research
has tackled these issues at an earlier stage in the drug discovery pathway. in particular, interest has increased in target discovery both for the identification of novel targets (target identification) and for reduction of subsequent failures from incorchemmedchem 2007, 2, 1116 – 1140

rect biological hypotheses through early validation (target validation)- the so-called “first to fail” principle. szymkowski from
roche bioscience[3] underlined the crucial role of target validation in the pharmaceutical industry, emphasising its role in
strengthening correlative data (from gene arrays, est libraries,
and proteomics) by demonstrating a pivotal role for the candidate in a disease model.

2. the druggable genome
a comprehensive analysis of the drug targets underlying current drug therapy undertaken in 1996 by jcrgen drews, the
former head of global research for hoffmann-la roche,
showed that less than 500 molecular targets were addressed.

the result was a far cry from the potential total number of targets, which drews originally estimated at somewhere between
3000 and 10 000. at that time human genes were thought to
number at least 100 000. over the following years the number
of discrete drug targets has not grown appreciably; on the
contrary, the number of human genes had shrunk, with most
estimates suggesting about 30 000 genes. thus, a greater slice
of the human genome was being targeted than previously believed (figure 2).

figure 2. number of drug targets. the effective number of drug targets can
be determined by the intersection of the number of genes linked to disease
and the “druggable” subset of the human genome.[4]

simona margutti received her degree in
chemistry in 2000 from the university of
genova (italy) where she held a fellowship position from murst (italian ministry for the university and research)
(2000–2001). between 2001 and 2004
she worked as project specialist in medicinal and organic chemistry at sympore gmbh (tuebingen, germany). in
2004 she joined the research group of
professor stefan laufer at the medicinal
chemistry department of university of tuebingen (germany)
where she is currently working. the main topic of her research is
the development of new map kinase inhibitors.
stefan laufer received his scientific
training at the universities of regensburg and mainz. (degree in pharmacy,
phd in pharmaceutical chemistry, habilitation for pharmaceutical chemistry).
after a postdoc period at the institute
of pharmaceutical chemistry and biopharmacy in frankfurt, germany, his professional appointments started in 1990
with head dept drug research at
merckle pharmaceutical gmbh, germany, which was followed by r&d director and member of the board
at the same company. since 1999 he holds the chair for pharmaceutical chemistry and is head to the department of pharmaceutical/medicinal chemistry at the eberhard-karls-university tuebingen,
germany. his research fields include anti-inflammatory drug research and discovery (molecular targets: cox-1/2/3, lipoxygenases,
cytokine-release inhibitors, kinase-inhibitors, transcription factors).

great excitement was generated by publications from celera
genomics[5] and the international human genome sequencing
consortium[6] describing the draft sequence of the human
genome only five years after drews’ analysis, and the crucial
question for every biopharma business became: “how many
potential drug targets are encoded in the human genome?”,
leading to the concept of “the druggable genome,” that is,
that subset of the ~ 30 000 genes in the human genome that
express proteins capable of binding drug-like molecules.
different companies conducted surveys on the druggable
genome. in 2002 pfizer inc. researchers andrew hopkins and
colin groom reported the identification of 399 nonredundant
molecular targets that are members of just 130 protein families. pfizer researchers identified several proteins targeted by
experimental drugs and eliminated other protein targets that
did not bind lipinski rule-of-five[7] compliant compounds with
binding affinities below 10 mm. although that ability of a protein to bind a small molecule with the appropriate chemical
properties at the required binding affinity might make it druggable, it doesn’t necessarily make it a potential drug target.
that honour belongs only to those proteins that are also
linked to disease. moreover, whereas not all proteins can be
modulated by small-molecules (undruggable targets), occasionally an unexpected allosteric binding site for a drug or
chemical tool is discovered. therefore, methods to discover ligands for unpredicted binding sites could improve the cost effectiveness of searches for chemical tools. the 2002 pfizer
survey confirmed that the potential for compound development is being increasingly addressed at earlier stages of discovery. the drug-like character of compounds has been assessed by means ranging from the intuition and experience of
the chemist to sophisticated computational methods; the
latter includes machine learning algorithms that generalise
from various chemical descriptors of known good drugs[8] and
expert systems that adopt a rule-based approach using easily
measured properties.[9] the ranges that according to the lipinski rule-of-five establish windows of drug-likeness have been
extended and refined with parameters such as the number of
rotatable bonds.[10] to date there have been few such general
heuristics for predicting the target-likeness or the inherent
tractability of targets to intervention, independent of their disease relevance; in this contest the hopkins and groom study
has the merit of considering the set of targets comprising the
druggable genome in aggregate terms, such as their drugbinding domain content.

3. signal transduction as drug target
in the field of target identification there has been a great deal
of enthusiasm for the prospect of identifying novel drug targets based on knowledge of key signal transduction components and their links to disease. as signalling disorders represent a major cause for the pathological states and as most of
the recently validated target molecules of drug research are
signal transduction related macromolecules (mostly kinases),
signal transduction therapy has become one of the most important areas of drug research.[11, 12] efforts to map signal trans-

drug discovery targets
duction pathways have intensified over the recent years. in
this regard, isis pharmaceuticals employs an interesting
method for mapping pathways using antisense oligonucleotides that can selectively reduce target gene expression. if this
target gene is in a key pathway, the lower level of protein expression will result in pathway interruption and cellular abnormalities, thus potentially validating the protein and its gene as
a therapeutic target of interest.

4. kinases as drug targets
approximately 20–25 % of the druggable genome consists of
kinases involved in signal transduction. currently, however,
only six kinase inhibitors are being used in clinical practice
(table 1), which yields a wide perspective for drug discovery.

the eukaryotic protein kinases form the largest superfamily
of homologous proteins and genes of the human genome.
within this family, there are now hundreds of different members whose sequences are known. although there is a rich diversity of structures, regulation modes, and substrate specificity among the protein kinases, there are also common structural features.
the common feature conserved throughout the entire protein kinase family is the catalytic domain with its associated
catalytic centre, which consist of ~ 250–300 amino acid residues. the chemical activity of a kinase involves removing a
phosphate group from atp and covalently attaching it to one
of three amino acids that have a free hydroxyl group. most kinases act on both serine and threonine (serine/threonine kinases), others act on tyrosine (tyrosine kinases), and a number
(dual specificity kinases) act on all three, for example, mek

(mapkk), which, as will be further discussed is involved in the
map kinase cascade, is a mixed serine/threonine and tyrosine
kinase. structurally distinct from most other protein kinases are
histidine kinases which are found mostly in prokaryotes as part
of two-component signal transduction mechanisms. a phosphate group from atp is first added to a histidine residue
within the kinase, and later transferred to an aspartate residue
on a receiver domain on a different protein, or sometimes on
the kinase itself. the aspartyl phosphate residue is then active
in signalling. some investigations[13, 14] seem to indicate the
presence of eukaryote-like kinases and phosphatases in prokaryotes as well.
different studies were undertaken on kinase classification
and homology, about twenty years ago hanks and collaborators[15] undertook a comparative analysis of all the available sequences of protein kinase catalytic domain. the homologous
catalytic-domain amino acid sequences of 65 distinct eukaryotic protein kinases were aligned and their overall relationship
was visualised by the construction of a phylogenetic tree demonstrating the overall similarity among the catalytic domains
(figure 3).
the catalytic domains were shown not to be uniformly conserved but, rather, consist of alternating region of high and
low conservation. such an arrangement of alternating regions
of high and low conservation is a common feature of homologous globular proteins and gives some clues to higher order
structure. a protein structure will provide a close general
model for other proteins with which its sequence homology is

> 50 %.[17] on the basis of amino acid sequence similarity,
seven groups of protein kinases are identified which are further divided into 90 families and 145 subfamilies.[16] relevant
for this survey, as will be discussed, are the mitogen-activated
protein kinases (mapks) and, in particular three well-characterised subfamilies of mapks: extracellular signal-regulated kinases  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx ; the c-jun nh2-terminal kinases,  xxxg1370xxx ,  xxxg1372xxx ,
and  xxxg1367xxx ; and four p38 enzymes, p38a, p38b, p38g, and p38d.
a fourth mapk, erk5, is a relatively recently identified[18] mapk
and is being studied intensely.[19–21] sequence alignments with
other human kinases, define for the atp binding site of p38a a
range of amino acid sequence conservation of 40–100 %.
within the erks,  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  share respectively 51.6 and
55 % of sequence homology with p38a; for  xxxg1370xxx ,  xxxg1372xxx , and
 xxxg1367xxx  the percentages are: 52.5, 55, and 44.5 % , finally for the
p38 isoforms the following data are reported: p38b 78.6 %,
p38g 68.6 %, and p38d 67.1 % homology. data within members
of the erk-family and jnk-family are also available and defined
as 85 and 78–84 % respectively.[22–27]
the individual family members, approximately 518 kinases,
constitute a functional basis for basically every physiological
process, kinases playing a central role in propagation of signal
transduction in every type of cell[28] and are reported to be involved in a plethora of diseases. in particular, tumourogenesis
has been linked to the aberrant function of protein kinases
that play roles in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
thus, kinases have become of particular interest as potential
targets for anticancer agents. as a result, protein kinases account for 20–30 % of the drug discovery programmes of many
companies, even though some problems are related to the
definition of kinases as drug target.
the discussed identical catalytic mechanism, together with a
high degree of sequence homology, identical protein folding
topologies, and the common co-substrate atp initially led to
the assumption that protein kinases constitute a nondruggable
family of protein targets. thus, it is possible that one small
molecule inhibitor may bind to several different kinases, in addition to the target, blocking normal signalling that is needed
for normal cellular function. however, it is possible that the potential to block a multitude of kinases may prove to be useful
in several types of cancers, as long as the inhibitor is specific
to malignant or premalignant cells. moreover, virtually all of
the protein-kinase inhibitors that have been developed were
atp competitive, and the difficulties that were involved in developing compounds with sufficient potency to compete with
the atp concentrations that are present in the intracellular
milieu (2–10 mm) were becoming apparent, especially for the
many protein kinases that have a michaelis–menten constant
(km) for atp of 10 mm or less. the challenge is for an inhibitor
to compete at nm concentrations against mm atp. indeed, it
might be no coincidence that a plethora of potent inhibitors
that target the p38 mapk have been developed, because its
km for atp is above 0.1 mm. it is surprising that virtually no
compounds that compete for binding with the protein-substrate binding site have progressed to late development
stages. unlike atp competitive inhibitors, such compounds
might have the potential to prevent a protein kinase from

drug discovery targets
phosphorylating some substrates but not others. a much
greater emphasis on developing compounds that bind preferentially to inactive forms of protein kinases, or which prevent
one protein kinase from activating another, might well pay dividends in the development of anti-inflammatory drugs; nevertheless, because of drug resistance issues, a similar approach
could be not optimal in anticancer research.

5. kinase inhibition
taking into consideration kinase inhibition principles, it is possible to distinguish four types of inhibitors: substrate-competitive inhibitors; atp-competitive inhibitors; activation inhibitors/allosteric modulators; and irreversible inhibitors.
5.1. types of inhibitors
substrate-competitive inhibitors. the substrate-binding site
seems to have obvious advantages over the atp-binding site
as a target for inhibiting kinase activity. first, substrate-binding
inhibitors are not affected by the high atp concentration
found in cells. second, the substrate-binding site of a kinase
controls selectivity, whereas the atp-binding site is highly conserved throughout all kinase family members. whereas substrate-competitive inhibition has been applied successfully in
enzyme classes such as the proteases, its use for kinase inhibition has not been successful thus far. as the kinases have
rather large substrate binding sites,[29] they lack the specific,
compact hydrophobic pockets that could serve as targets for
small molecule inhibitors.
atp-competitive inhibitors. as previously discussed in this
review, for a long time the development of a potent and selective atp-competitive inhibitor was considered impossible. the
main concerns are selectivity, because of the shared highly
conserved atp-binding site, and, potency; as a consequence of
intracellular atp concentrations up to 10 mm. thus, the concentrations required for an inhibitor to reach 50 % inhibition
are two or three orders of magnitude higher than the inhibition constant itself. experience collected over the last ten years
shows that fairly selective atp-site specific kinase inhibitors
can be generated, because of the suitability of the binding site
to drug design, with different examples showing that specificity and selectivity can be achieved by the derivatisation pattern
of an underlying core structure.[11] on the other hand, it must
be underscored that many specific protein-kinase inhibitors,
such as  xxxd1169xxx  and  xxxd3177xxx , are not developable because
of toxicity or adme problems. nevertheless, from a chemical
biology perspective, these compounds could be extremely
useful research agents.
selectivity of an inhibitor can theoretically be explored by
kinase profile assay. the standard biochemical approach to addressing this problem relies on the specificity screens with an
in vitro inhibition assay against panels of purified kinases.[30] a
recent ambit bioscience publication[31] describes a map
method to determine kinase inhibitor specificity by measuring
binding of small molecules to the atp site of kinases. the binding assay was used to profile 20 kinase inhibitors against a
chemmedchem 2007, 2, 1116 – 1140

panel of 119 protein kinases. the low concentration of kinases
used in this method allows measurement of binding affinities
as low as 1–10 pm; furthermore, binding affinity provides a
common denominator that allows direct comparisons between
all kinases in the panel. as it is not yet possible to biochemically assay every kinase in the genome, it will become more
important to show that a drug is exerting its effect through inhibition of a particular protein kinase, by showing that the
effect of the drug disappears when a drug-resistant mutant is
overexpressed or replaces a wild-type enzyme. this approach
is based on the evidence that every protein kinase can be mutated into an active, inhibitor-insensitive mutant, often by
changing the gatekeeper residue into a bulkier residue. this
method is used for highly stringent target validation.
irreversible inhibitors. irreversible inhibitors are not usually
used in the pharmaceutical industry because of the possible
toxicity they could incur. an example of this type of inhibitor is
 xxxd421xxx , an irreversible small-molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that blocks signal transduction through all four members
of the  xxxg682xxx  (or  xxxg681xxx  [egf]) family and is in
development for the treatment of advanced nonhematological
cancers.[32]
activation inhibitors/allosteric modulators. more relevant
and interesting are allosteric modulators, which as previously
pointed out, could potentially solve the selectivity issues related to protein kinase inhibition.[33] a first example of an inhibitor exploiting such a mechanism was gleevec (imatinib, sti571). the structural mechanism for its inhibition of abels  xxxg2198xxx  (abl) was described by researchers from the rockefeller university in 2000.[34] as already pointed out, whereas
conformations of protein kinases that are fully active are very
similar, striking differences exist among the various inactive
conformations of kinases from different subfamilies. a crucial
aspect of the conformational transition between the active
and inactive states is the activation loop segment, which is of
varying length and sequence, and is often the site of activating
phosphorylation in the kinase domain. in structures of protein
kinases that are in a fully active state, the activation loop is in
an extended or open conformation. two crucial aspects define
this active conformation of the activation loop. first, an  xxxd233xxx  residue (asp 381 in abl) within a strictly conserved aspphe-gly (dfg) motif at the nh2-terminal base of the activation
loop is positioned so as to interact properly with a magnesium
ion that coordinates the phosphate group of atp. second, the
rest of the loop is positioned away from the catalytic centre so
that the cooh-terminal portion of the activation loop provides
a platform for substrate binding. in the structure of abl–stk571,[34] and the ablk–stk-571[35] complex, the nh2-terminal portion is rotated drastically with respect to the active conformation, so that the activation loop adopts a conformation that
mimics substrate binding to the enzyme and prevents its activation by other kinases.[36] critical to the binding of gleevec is
the adoption by the kinase of an inactive conformation, in
which the centrally located activation loop is not phosphorylated. the conformation of this loop is distinct from that in active
protein kinases, and from the inactive form of the closely related src kinases. as a result, the inhibitor has a high affinity for

abl kinase, yet being essentially inactive against ser/thr-kinases and most of the tyrosine kinases. these selective results
suggest that compounds that exploit the distinctive inactivation mechanism of individual protein kinases can achieve both
high affinity and high specificity.
another example of this allosteric type of binding mode is
the boehringer ingelheim compound  xxxd1929xxx , which will be
discussed further.
5.2. structural basis for inhibitor selectivity
to further prove that specificity could be achieved by atpcompetitive inhibitors, crucial experimental data has been published by researchers at merck.[37] comparison of the crystal
structures of p38 bound to different compounds showed that
binding of more specific molecules is characterised by a peptide flip between met 109 and gly 110. gly 110 being a residue
specific to the a, b, and g isoforms of p38. the s isoform and
the other map kinases have bulkier residues in this position.
these larger residues would likely make the peptide flip energetically unfavourable, thus explaining the selectivity of binding. this stabilised peptide flip is caused by a switching of the
hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor distribution around the
peptide plane.
in p38a, the peptide flip changes the (f,y) peptide bond
angles of met 109 (i residue)
and gly 110 (i + 1 residue) from
a (b, ar) conformation to a (ar,
al) conformation, without affecting the orientation of adjacent peptide planes or side
chains. this flip belongs to the
group two flips, which are characterised by having y(i) values
that are in the ar or al regions
when fachtungre(i+1) is positive. as fachtungre(i+1) must take on positive
values if peptide-plane flipping
is to occur, the residue at position i + 1 is often a glycine; the
x-gly motif seems to be quite
common among different cases.
if the residue i + 1 is not a glycine, the presence of a residue
other than glycine would probably reduce the likelihood that
the peptide flip would occur.

otic cells possess multiple mapk pathways, which co-ordinately
regulate diverse cellular activities, running the gamut from
gene expression, mitosis, and metabolism to motility, survival
and apoptosis, and differentiation. to date, five distinct groups
of mapks have been characterised in mammals: extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (erks) 1 and 2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2), c-jun aminoterminal kinases (jnks) 1,2, and 3, p38 isoforms a, b, g, and d,
erks 3 and 4, and erk5.[38, 39] as saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses six different mapks, the relatively greater complexity of
the human genome suggests that there are probably several
additional vertebrate mapk subfamilies. the most extensively
studied groups of vertebrate mapks to date are  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnks,
and p38 kinases.
mapks can be activated by a variety of different stimuli
(figure 4), but in general,  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  are preferentially activated in response to growth factors and phorbol esters, whereas the jnk and p38 kinases are most responsive to stress stimuli ranging from osmotic shock and ionising radiation to mechanical wear and cytokine stimulation.
6.1.  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  signalling pathway

shared by the mapk pathways. each family of mapks is composed of a set of three evolutionarily conserved, sequentially acting kinases: a mapk, a mapk kinase (mapkk), and a mapkk kinase (mapkkk). the mapkkks, which
are serine/threonine kinases are often activated through phosphorylation and/or as a result of their interaction
with a small  xxxg1027xxx  of the ras/rho family in response to extracellular stimuli. mapkkk activation
leads to the phosphorylation and activation of a mapkk, which then stimulates mapk activity through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues located in the activation loop of the kinase. once activated,
mapks phosphorylate target substrates on serine or threonine residues followed by a proline; however, substrate
selectivity is often conferred by a specific interaction motif located on the physiological substrate.

drug discovery targets
and  xxxg1366xxx . the erk pathway, also known as the p42/ xxxd1355xxx  map
kinase pathway, is a major determinant in the control of cell
growth, cell differentiation, and cell survival. this pathway,
which operates downstream of ras, is often upregulated in
human tumours and as such represents an attractive target for
anticancer therapy.
 xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx  have 83 % amino acid similarity and are expressed to varying extents in all tissues, including terminally
differentiated cells, and have been estimated to be present in
the range of 100–500 nm in tissues of greatest abundance.

6.1.1. mechanism of activation
erk pathway is outlined in figure 5. cell surface receptors such
as tyrosine kinases (rtk) and g protein-coupled receptors
transmit activating signals to the raf/mek/erk cascade
through different isoforms of the small  xxxg1027xxx 

in general, mek family members are among the most selective protein kinases known in that they phosphorylate very
few substrates.  xxxg1361xxx /2 have not been shown to phosphorylate any other map kinases or other proteins of physiologic
relevance. however, mek4 has been shown to phosphorylate
at least one protein other than map kinases, suggesting that
other meks may also have a few non-map kinase substrates.
 xxxg1369xxx /2 are distributed throughout cells. in unstimulated fibroblasts the majority of them are associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton. upon stimulation, a significant population
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 accumulates in the nucleus; the nuclear localisation
is essential for morphological transformation of 3t3 fibroblasts
and for neurite extension in pc12 cells, a model system for
neuronal differentiation.[38]
by amplification through the signalling cascade, it is estimated that activation of only 5 % of ras molecules is sufficient to
induce full activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2.[48]  xxxg1369xxx /2 signalling has been
implicated as a key regulator of cell proliferation,[49] and for
this reason, inhibitors of the erk pathway are entering clinical
trials as potential anticancer agents.[47, 50] an example is sorafenib launched as a drug in 2005 and recently reviewed by wilhelm et al.[51] in fact, the erk pathway represents a convergence point for the majority of mitogenic signalling pathways,
so that there are many upstream signalling molecules including receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) grb2, sos, shc, ras, and
protein kinase c whose abnormal activation could culminate in
the constitutive activation of the erk pathway and could represent potential targets for the development of anticancer
drugs.
the erk pathway inhibitors are divided in two classes:  xxxg1924xxx 
inhibitors and  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitors (figure 6).

ras.[40, 41] the exact mechanism of raf activation is still elusive[42, 43] but is known to require ras binding and multiple
phosphorylation events at the membrane. regulation of both
ras and raf is crucial for the proper maintenance of cell proliferation, as activating mutations in these genes lead to oncogenesis. activated raf binds to and phosphorylates the dual
specificity kinases  xxxg1361xxx  and -2, which in turn phosphorylate
 xxxg1369xxx /2 within a conserved thr-glu-tyr (tey) motif in their activation loop. like map kinases, meks are activated over 1000fold by phosphorylation of two residues.[44–46] however, both
phosphorylations are on either serine or threonine, and each
of the two will partially increase the activity of  xxxg1361xxx /2.
chemmedchem 2007, 2, 1116 – 1140

the major cause of constitutive activation of the erk pathway
in human tumours is a disorder in raf, ras, or other signalling
molecules upstream of ras.[52] specific inhibitors of raf are expected to efficiently block aberrantly activated mitogenic signalling. examples of  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors are gw5074 and sorafenib
( xxxd3226xxx ).
gw5074 inhibits  xxxg1924xxx  kinase activity in vitro with an ic50 of
9 nm. it also inhibits egf-stimulated erk activation quite effectively without inhibiting the egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx .
sorafenib[51, 53–55] was identified as a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1924xxx 
by screening chemical libraries using a combination of an in vitro  xxxg1924xxx  biochemical assay and a tumour cell-based
mechanistic assay.[56] sorafenib inhibits  xxxg1924xxx  kinase activity in
vitro with an ic50 of 12 nm. it also suppress tumour growth in
human tumour xenograft models with mutant  xxxg1285xxx  genes
(htc116 colon carcinoma, miapaca-2pancreatic carcinoma, and
h460 non-small cell lung carcinoma). however, sorafenib, as a
single agent, failed to show therapeutic activity in the treatment of malignant melanoma, despite positive results in renal
carcinoma.[57] this is probably because it also inhibits a
number of other kinases (such as  xxxg800xxx   xxxg802xxx   xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ), which are
also overexpressed in renal carcinoma. the reason for the failure in malignant melanoma may be attributed to its inability

large degree of cross-talk between the various signalling
pathways, it is possible that
some tumours cells might be
able to overcome inhibition of
this pathway.[63] thus, it is likely
that these kinase inhibitors will
be more effective in combination with agents acting by
other mechanisms.

 xxxg1924xxx . niculescu-duvaz et al.[58] recently presented improved
 xxxg1924xxx  inhibitors based on a disubstituted pyrazine scaffold.
6.1.3.  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitors
to date no substrates for  xxxg1361xxx /2[47] have been identified other
than  xxxg1369xxx  and  xxxg1366xxx . this apparent selectivity, in addition to an
ability to phosphorylate both tyr and thr residues, is consistent with  xxxg1361xxx /2 playing a central role in the integration of
mitogenic signals into the erk pathway.[59–61]  xxxg1361xxx /2 have not
been identified as oncogene products, but they stand at the
focal point of many mitogenic signalling pathways, and constitutive activation of  xxxg1361xxx  has been detected in a variety of
human tumour cells.[52] these findings suggest  xxxg1361xxx /2 as a
good target for anticancer agents development. in figure 5
some  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitors are reported and their structures are illustrated in figure 6. as previously discussed, the majority of
protein kinase inhibitors developed so far are competitive with
atp.  xxxd1169xxx ,  xxxd3462xxx , and  xxxd1688xxx  differ in this respect as
they do not compete with atp, a characteristic that may allow
those compounds to function as more specific inhibitors.
as the ras-mapk signalling pathway is of the central importance with regard to cell proliferation, transformation, and invasion, inhibitors of the kinase components of this pathway
would appear to have great potential as anticancer agents. as
pointed out by berger and mallon,[62] despite the central
nature of this pathway, selective inhibitors of raf and mek
appear to cause no toxic effects in normal cells. a potential
issue for a selective kinase inhibitor is resistance. as there is a

the jnks were first identified by
their activation in response to a
variety of extracellular stresses
and their ability to phosphorylate the n-terminal transactivation domain of the transcription
factor c-jun.  xxxg1370xxx , -2, and -3,
are also known as sapkg,
sapka, and sapkb, which exist
as ten or more spliced
forms.[24, 64] the  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx 
genes are expressed ubiquitously. in contrast, the  xxxg1367xxx  gene
has a more limited pattern of
expression and is largely restricted to brain, heart, and testis.
they are involved in cytokine production and other aspects of
the inflammatory response, more generally in the function of
the immune system, stress-induced and developmentally programmed apoptosis, actin reorganisation, and in cell transformation.[65]
activation requires, like  xxxg1369xxx /2 and p38, dual phosphorylation on tyr and thr within the tripeptide motif thr-pro-tyr
(tpy) located in the kinase subdomain.[24] this phosphorylation
is mediated by a dual specificity protein kinase. jnk activators
are mkk4 (sek1/jnkk) which has been characterised[66–68] and
mkk7. in turn, mkk4/7 are activated by phosphorylation mediated by several mapkkks, including mekk1-4, mlk2 and-3, tpl2,  xxxg604xxx ,  xxxg2246xxx  and -2, tak1, and ask1 and -2.[39] the mechanism
of mekk1 activation is not understood, but this pathway may
involve the phosphorylation of mekk1 by the pak protein
kinase that is activated by the small gtp binding proteins rac1
and cdc42. the structure of the jnk signalling pathway is
therefore similar to the erk pathway that is activated by the
small gtp binding protein ras via the  xxxg1924xxx  and the  xxxg1361xxx  protein kinase cascade (figure 7).[69]
like  xxxg1369xxx /2, the activities of jnk/sapks are influenced by
nuclear hormones. swantek initially demonstrated that activation of jnk/sapks in macrophages and other cell types is inhibited by glucocorticoids in a manner that depends on the
presence of nuclear receptors but not on transcription.[70] the
mechanism has not been elucidated, but the site of inhibition
appears to lie upstream of mek7. dexamethasone also inhibited  xxxg2296xxx -induced jnk phosphorylation in hela cells, based on
immunofluorescence with antiphosphojnk antibodies.[71] a

figure 7. schematic representation of the jnk pathway. jnks respond to
stress signals including heat shock, osmotic stress, inflammatory cytokines,
growth factors and gpcr agonists. stress signals are delivered to this cascade by members of small gtpases of the rho family (rac, rho, cdc42).as
with the other mapks, the membrane proximal kinase is a mapkkk, typically
mekk1/4, or a member of the mixed lineage kinases (mlk) that phosphorylates and activates mkk4 (sek) or mkk7, the sap/jnk kinases. alternatively,
mkk4/7 can be activated by a member of the germinal centre kinase ( xxxg876xxx )
family in a gtpase-independent manner. activation of jnk is by dual phosphorylation (at thr-pro-tyr motif) by mapkk4/7. activated jnks dimerize and
translocate to the nucleus where they activate (phosphorylate) transcription
factors including c-jun, atf-2, elk-1, and p53. activation of the jnk signalling
cascade generally results in apoptosis and is involved in inflammation.

possibly similar effect has been observed with  xxxd3417xxx .[72]
the transcriptional activation function of the  xxxd3417xxx  receptor was required for the long term but not the acute suppression of jnk/ xxxg1372xxx  activity. the effect could be detected at
the level of mkk4, which was also inhibited. at least part of
the suppression was due to induction of  xxxg664xxx .
6.2.1. jnk function

pathophysiological processes. in the first studies to evaluate
 xxxg1370xxx /1 and  xxxg1372xxx  –/– mice, the loss of either jnk isoform was
shown to alter t cell differentiation.[76–78] as the inappropriate
regulation of t cells underlies many autoimmune diseases, attention has been directed to the inhibition of jnks in diseases
such as rheumatoid arthritis. in more recent studies, roles specifically for  xxxg1372xxx  as a mediator of inflammatory responses have
been explored. in the passive collagen-induced arthritis model,
the  xxxg1372xxx –/– animals showed modestly decreased joint
damage (cartilage erosion and proteoglycan depletion) but
little effect on inflammation, leading to a conclusion that  xxxg1372xxx 
was not the sole mediator of arthritic changes.[79] gene knockout animals have been used to demonstrate that jnk could
provide a suitable target for the protection against obesity and
diabetes and that jnks may act as tumour suppressors. the
role of jnks as therapeutic targets has been recently reviewed
by manning and davis.[80]
in parallel to these studies, other approaches to inhibit expression of jnks such as antisense techniques and the more
recently adopted rna-mediated interference approaches
should accelerate discoveries of the cellular events mediated
by jnks, and will determine whether jnks are druggable targets.
6.2.2. pathway inhibitors
specific inhibitors for the jnk/ xxxg1372xxx  pathway are not yet available. most of the jnk inhibitors reported thus far come from
synthetic efforts to design p38 inhibitors. the p38 inhibitors
 xxxd3177xxx  (described earlier) and sb202190 also block jnk activity at concentrations above those necessary to block p38.
there are, however, some naturally occurring peptide inhibitors that have been reported.[81, 82] park et al. showed that selenite was a direct inhibitor of  xxxg1370xxx  activity both in vitro and
in vivo, having an in vitro ic50 of between 10 nm and 50 nm.
cep-1347, a mlk inhibitor. one of the first compounds to be
discovered that inhibits the jnk pathway but without effect on
p38 is cephalon’s cep-1347 that inhibits the jnk pathway at
the level of the mlk (figure 11). the compound inhibits all five
members of the mlk family (mlk1, mlk2, mlk3, dual leucine
zipper kinase, and leucine zipper-bearing kinase) and members
of the  xxxg876xxx  family ( xxxg876xxx , khs, and nik). cep-1347 prevents
death of neurons that had been deprived of growth factors
and also inhibits  xxxg1370xxx  activation with equivalent ic50 values;

compared with erk, jnk activity is more strongly induced in
response to proinflammatory stimuli, and there is preliminary
evidence that inhibition of jnk activity can retard or prevent
tissue damage in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis.[73]
one approach to study the function of jnks has included
in vivo gene knockouts of each of the three jnk genes. whereas loss of either  xxxg1370xxx  or  xxxg1372xxx  alone appears to have no serious
consequences, their combined knockout is embryonic lethal.[74] in contrast, the loss of  xxxg1367xxx  is not embryonic lethal, but rather protects the adult brain from
glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[75] this latter example has generated considerable enthusiasm for  xxxg1367xxx ,
considered an appropriate target for the treatment
of diseases in which neuronal death should be prevented (for example, stroke, alzheimer’s, and parkinson’s diseases). in contrast to the expression pattern
of  xxxg1367xxx , the expression of  xxxg1370xxx  and  xxxg1372xxx  proteins is
not tissue-restricted. it has therefore taken greater
efforts and more complex studies to understand the
figure 8. chemical inhibitors of the jnk pathway. cep-1347 was discovered during atrole of these two jnk isoforms in physiological and
tempted optimisation of the natural product  xxxd2415xxx .

 xxxg1369xxx /2 activity is unaffected. this inhibitor also inhibits  xxxg1370xxx

cep-1347, originally called kt7515 (or 3,9 bis[(ethylthio)methyl]- xxxd2415xxx ), was identified in a medicinal chemistry approach directed to optimise the drug-like properties of the naturally occurring compound  xxxd2415xxx [83] (figure 8). specifically, a

 xxxd3231xxx , an atp-competitive inhibitor of jnk mapk. different research groups have been focused their attention toward
inhibition of jnk mapk rather than the upstream components
of the pathway, with the aim of achieving greater specificity of
effects. one of the major players in this area has been signal
pharmaceuticals (now part of celgene). signal has described
pyrazoloanthrone derivatives, such as  xxxd3231xxx  (figure 9), as
inhibitors of jnk.[86]  xxxd3231xxx  inhibits  xxxg1370xxx /2 with an ic50 of
110 nm and  xxxg1367xxx  with an ic50 of 150 nm, but is much less
active against p38 (ic50 = 30 mm).[73] anthrapyrazoles have not
been previously reported as kinase inhibitors; however, the
presence of nitrogens within the highly planar, fused-ring
structure of  xxxd3231xxx  is consistent with features of other
known kinase inhibitors.[25] such ring structures exhibit poor
solubility in water, (only 0.0012 ng ml 1) as originally described by bennett and co-workers.[25] chemical modification
studies undertaken to define the critical features of  xxxd3231xxx 
required for its inhibition of jnk have shown that n-alkyl substitution lowered inhibitory activity, whereas a chlorine added
at position 8 produced a more potent analogue.[25] it may thus
be possible to further enhance the solubility of sp600-125 derivatives yet retaining the inhibitory capability.

figure 10. p38 mapk signalling pathways. p38 mapks are members of the
mapk family that are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and inflammatory cytokines. as with other mapk cascades, the membrane-proximal component is a mapkkk, typically a mekk or a mixed lineage kinase
(mlk). the mapkkk phosphorylates and activates  xxxg1363xxx /6, the p38 apoptotic
stimuli. p38 mapk is involved in regulation of  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx  and mapkap-2 and
several transcription factors including atf-2, stat1, the max/myc complex,
mef-2, elk-1 and, indirectly, creb by activation of msk1. localization of p38
is controversial; in fact, p38 has been shown to be present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of quiescent cells, but upon cell stimulation, the cellular
localization of p38 is not well understood. some evidence suggests that, following activation, p38 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, but
other data indicate that activated p38 is also present in the cytoplasm of
stimulated cells.

 xxxd3231xxx  was shown to block il-1-induced accumulation of
phosphorylated jnk and expression of c-jun in cultured synoviocytes. in vivo, administration of  xxxd3231xxx  was shown to inhibit jnk activation and collagenase expression in the joints of
rats with adjuvant arthritis. animals also showed a reduction in
paw swelling and bone and cartilage damage. thus, inhibition
of jnk could be a potential therapy for diseases as rheumatoid
arthritis.
concerns arise from the ic50 values for the three jnk isoforms (see figure 9). for some applications, an inhibitor with
this ability to interfere with all jnk isoforms will be desirable,
but as the previously discussed results of jnk gene knockout
studies have suggested, isoforms perform specific roles. therefore, the discovery of new compounds (or  xxxd3231xxx  derivatives) showing isoform selectivity would be highly desirable.
the best clinical prospect for jnk inhibitors would appear to
be as agents with a neuronal target such as stroke or parkinson’s disease, where a specific  xxxg1367xxx  inhibitor could be given
without effects on non-neuronal cells.

mediates t-cell differentiation and apoptosis by regulating
gamma interferon production.
the requirement for p38 activation in cellular responses has
been defined largely through the use of experimental pyridinyl-imidazole anti-inflammatory drugs, the cytokine-suppressive
anti-inflammatory drugs (csaids), the most extensively characterised of which is the compound  xxxd3177xxx .
p38 inhibitors are potent inhibitors of lps-mediated  xxxg2296xxx 
production in macrophages.[22] the ability of p38 inhibitors to
block  xxxg2296xxx  synthesis can be exploited in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
6.3.2 pyridinyl-imidazole inhibitor:  xxxd3177xxx 
the basis for p38 inhibition was revealed in the crystal structure of p38a in complex with  xxxd3177xxx . as previously discussed, in vitro assays demonstrated that only p38 a and b are
inhibited by csaids; p38 d and g are completely unaffected by
this class of drugs in vitro or in transfected cells.[91] davies and
co-authors[30] published a study on specificities of different
commercially available compounds with relatively selective inhibition of particular serine/threonine-specific protein kinases,
describing the preferential inhibition of the a and b isoforms
over the g and s by  xxxd3177xxx .
crystallographic,[103–105] mutational,[106, 107] and biochemical[108]
studies demonstrated that  xxxd3177xxx  binds in the atp binding
site of p38. the 4-fluorophenyl ring of the inhibitor is located
in a hydrophobic pocket with walls formed by the n-terminal
domain core at the back of the active site (figure 15). thr 106
in the hinge of the p38a atp binding pocket is the factor determining the nature of the residue that can be accommodated in the hydrophobic region; groups such as p-fluorophenyl,
m,p-difluorophenyl, and m-trifluoromethylphenyl substituents
on either imidazole or pyrrole scaffolds can occupy a space
near thr 106 (figure 14). the selectivity of compounds as
 xxxd3177xxx  for p38a has been attributed to the presence of
thr 106 in the atp-binding site. other map kinases (table 3),

except p38b, have either a met or a gln residue in this position
and the larger side chains of these residues prevent the binding of the fluorophenyl ring of the inhibitors. a site-directed
mutagenesis study undertaken by lisnok et al.[107] showed that
mutation of thr 106 to gln, the residue present at the corresponding position in  xxxg1366xxx , or met, the corresponding residue
in p38g, p38d, and jnks, renders the inhibitor ineffective.
thr 106 orients the drug to interact with his 107 and leu 108 of

alone or in combination with his 107 or leu 108, with the corresponding, more bulky residues from p38g or p38d (met and

ous described pyridin-4-yl imidazole derivatives, notably, the
several studies were undertaken.[113] crystallographic and kinetic experiments have shown that all pyridinyl-imidazole p38 information of a hydrogen bond between the backbone nh

cannot bind to inactivated p38. it has also been shown that
p38 inhibitors as  xxxd3177xxx , bind equally well to both the activated and inactivated forms of the enzyme. therefore, when
p38 is in its inactivated form, atp is noncompetitive with those
inhibitors. this fact leads to a thermodynamic advantage for
the inhibitor in vivo, where the high atp concentration would
require very high inhibitor concentrations to effectively compete with atp. experimental data suggest a mechanism by
which a kinase inhibitor that competes with atp can function
in vivo at concentrations approximately equal to its ki value.
the inhibitor may bind to a form of the enzyme that is inaccessible to atp and thereby prevents transformation of the
enzyme into its atp accessible form.
 xxxd3177xxx  is a reasonably selective and cell permeable inhibitor that inhibits p38a kinase activity in vitro with an ic50 of
50 nm against 100 mm atp. using  xxxd3177xxx , several sar studies leading to selectivity and potency improvements and novel

whether this unwanted side effect is caused by the pyridine or

substituents at the imidazole ring nitrogen adjacent to the pyridine ring,[120, 121] and the replacement of the imidazole ring

rwj67657 and  xxxd3177xxx , mostly in their association rates. the
difference between the most potent inhibitors, in turn, is determined by their dissociation rate (rwj67657 versus
 xxxd3177xxx ), that is, the strength of protein–inhibitor interactions. interestingly, the binding characteristics of atp are similar to those of the weak inhibitors. with regard to the correlation between kd and ic50 values in the cell-based assay, the authors conclude that these imidazoles bind to the unactivated
form of the enzyme. atp, on the other hand, has only weak affinity for unactivated p38,[128] and this crucial difference may
explain why inhibitors binding in the atp cleft of p38 are able
to maintain their efficacy in cell-based assays. the pharmacology of rwj67657 as the most potent inhibitor from this series
was further evaluated and the compound was advanced into
early clinical trials with indications as an antiarthritic drug and
agent for inflammatory bowel disease.[129]

6.3.4. allosteric n,n’-diarylurea-based inhibitors:  xxxd1929xxx 
research groups at vertex,[130, 131] bayer, and boehringer have
independently described n,n’-diarylureas as inhibitors of p38
cytokine release.[132–134] while binding to the atp cleft of p38,
inhibitors of this class adopt a binding mode distinct from that
of both atp competitive and the diaryl heterocycles-based inhibitors.
the group at boehringer has demonstrated that the potent
n-aryl-n’-pyrazolylurea  xxxd1929xxx  (figure 16) stabilises a conformation of p38 which cannot be accessed by atp, and  xxxd1929xxx 
is therefore best described as a noncompetitive, allosteric inhibitor of p38.

group characteristic for potent n,n’-diarylurea inhibitors. the
tolyl substituent on the  xxxd3045xxx  ring has favourable interactions with the hydrophobic portions of the side chain of the
conserved glu 71 in helix ac. this tolyl group also causes a
conformational change in the glu 71 side chain such that only
one of the urea nh groups can hydrogen bond with this residue (figure 16). as previously pointed out, it has been speculated that this conformational rearrangement of the protein is
the rate determining step responsible for the slow binding kinetic observed for these allosteric p38 inhibitors. the morpholino ether oxygen makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone
nh of residue 109, equivalent to that made by the n1 atom of
the adenine base of atp. in addition to establishing interactions in the atp pocket, the morpholino group also improves
the physical-chemical properties of the otherwise lipophilic inhibitor.[132]
 xxxd1929xxx  is in development by boehringer ingelheim as a
treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions such as crohn’s disease and psoriasis.  xxxd1929xxx  has a picomolar affinity for p38a (kd = 0.1 nm) and inhibits the enzyme
with an ic50 = 63 nm.[135]
by september 2001, the in vivo effects of  xxxd1929xxx  on neutrophil activation had been tested in phase i clinical trials. in a
single-escalating dose, randomised, placebo-controlled, double
blind, 64-patient trial,  xxxd1929xxx  was well tolerated at all dosages.
in 2001, a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo
controlled study into the efficacy and safety of different doses
(5, 10, 20, and 30 mg) of  xxxd1929xxx , taken orally twice daily
during 4 weeks in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in
whom at least one damard has not been effective was initiated. a potentially dose limiting side effect, liver transaminase
values above the upper limit of normal, has been reported.

figure 16. structure of  xxxd1929xxx  and its main interaction with p38a.

upon binding of  xxxd1929xxx  to p38, a considerable conformational change takes place in the conserved asp 168/phe 169/
gly 170 (dfg) region. the switch from the “dfg-in” to the
“dfg-out” conformation arranges the side chain of phe 169 in
a way that leads to a steric clash with the phosphate groups
of atp. at the same time a large hydrophobic pocket is revealed, which is capable of accommodating the tert-butyl
chemmedchem 2007, 2, 1116 – 1140

apart from the imidazole nucleus, a multitude of other monocyclic and fused heterocycles was employed as scaffolds for
the essential diaryl pharmacophore. the trisubstituted  xxxd3045xxx 
developed at pfizer,  xxxd3181xxx  (table 6), is an example. pfizer recently presented data[136] on the synthesis and development of
this orally active p38 inhibitor. the compound exhibits significant functional selectivity for p38a (ic50 = 80 nm) over p38b
(ic50 = 26 000 nm). the binding modus of  xxxd3181xxx  has been described. as the substituent at the 3-position of the  xxxd3045xxx 
ring approaches the atp binding site of p38 kinase, a hydrophobic cavity in the p38 kinase develops around the 3-position
substituent at the binding site. this hydrophobic cavity is believed to form as the 3-position substituent binds to a specific
peptide sequence of the enzyme. in particular, it is believed to
bind to the side chains of lys 52, glu 59, leu 73, ile 82, leu 84,
leu 101, and the methyl group of the thr 103 side chain of p38
kinase at the atp binding site. the pyrimidine ring at the 4-position of the  xxxd3045xxx  ring, as already described for diarylimidazoles, brings a suitable hydrogen bond acceptor functionality.
this acceptor bonds to the backbone n-h of the met 106 residue while one edge of this substituent is in contact with bulk

 xxxd3136xxx  (table 6) is a  xxxd3045xxx  ketone developed at
roche by applying a high throughput screening (hts) approach to develop multiple leads series from distinct scaffolds.[137] this hts campaign led to the identification of several
 xxxd3045xxx  ketones which were found to inhibit p38a at low micromolar concentrations. co-crystallisation of  xxxd3136xxx  with
unphosphorylated p38a revealed a novel binding motif in the
atp binding site that was previously unknown for p38 kinase
inhibitors.[138] particularly, two hydrogen bonds formed between the amine of the inhibitor and the backbone his 107
and with the side chain hydroxyl group of thr 106. the latter
residue is present in approximately 205 of human kinases and,

hydrogen bond to thr 106 would confer improved selectivity
versus other kinases which lack this residue. in addition, the
 xxxd3045xxx  ketones make a hydrogen bond between the benzoyl
oxygen and the main chain of met 109. this key interaction is
observed in all reported structures of atp competitive p38 inhibitors. additional binding energy is generated by the position of the n-phenyl ring into the hydrophobic pocket which is
partially defined by the specificity residue thr 106. the glycerol
monoether group attached to the meta position of the benzoyl ring of  xxxd3136xxx  confers good physicochemical properties
(solubility and oral bioavailability) yet retaining potency
against p38 and also affords good inhibition of lps induced
cytokine production in undiluted human whole blood, and efficacy in in vivo inflammation models.  xxxd3136xxx  inhibits p38
with an ic50 = 700 nm.  xxxd3136xxx  binds to p38a (both, nonphosphorylated and the thr 180 and tyr 182 phosphorylated)
and p38b isoforms but does not bind to either the p38g or
p38d isoform. based on the range of efficacy in the biological
models, the desirable metabolic profile, and the favourable
preclinical safety pharmacology,  xxxd3136xxx  was selected as a
clinical candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
amg548 (table 6), in clinical development as an antiarthritic
drug, contains the classical  xxxd3177xxx  diaryl interaction but
changing the core heterocycle to a 6-membered ring. amg548
was in phase i human trials and data supporting the advancement of this compound had been presented. the pyridinone
inhibitor interacts with p38a through the classical met 109-pyridine hydrogen bond. the c2 carbonyl and lys 53 also form a
hydrogen bond. preclinical data showed that amg548 is efficacious in both acute (lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  production in mice)
and chronic (cia and adjuvant induced-arthritis (ada) in lewis
rats) models of arthritis. in these in vivo models amg548 ameliorated acute production of proinflammatory cytokines
(ed50 = 0.5 mg kg 1) and inhibited the symptomatic and structural manifestations of severe joint destruction in cia and also
ada. pharmacokinetic evaluation in both rat and dog revealed
good terminal half-life (t1/2) and suitable oral bioavailability for
once-daily oral dosing in humans. evaluation in 14 day rodent
toxicology studies and dog qtc studies demonstrated the desired safety multiples with no qtc prolongation in dogs. based

on overall profile of amg548, the molecule was advanced to
safety assessment and subsequently to phase i clinical trials.
amg548 was the first internal small-molecule clinical candidate
for amgen and it progressed from clinical candidate portal to
first-in-human (fih) dosing in less than one year. in the fih
study, amg548 was dosed orally at 0.3 to 300 mg (once daily).
amg 548 had linear pharmacokinetics with a mean terminal
elimination t1/2 of 24 h. the compound demonstrated 30 to
955 inhibition of ex vivo whole blood lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  and
il-1b cytokine production at oral doses of 3, 10, 30, 60, 100,
and 300 mg (once daily) in healthy male volunteers. at doses
of 60 to 300 mg, > 85 % inhibition was observed beyond 24 h,
following a single oral dose. these data demonstrate that
amg548 possesses suitable pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics for once-daily oral dosing. amg548 was further evaluated in a 14 day multiple dose study in 54 healthy male volunteers. isolated liver enzyme elevations were observed in nine
out of 54 individuals randomised to amg548, and one of 18 individuals randomised to placebo. these hepatic transaminase
levels were not associated with increases in bilirubin or alkaline
phosphatase. further development of amg548 was suspended
because of random liver enzyme elevations that were not
dose- or exposure-dependent.
in march 2005, takeda reported the discovery of tak715
(table 6) as a potent and orally active antirheumatic
agent.[137, 139, 140] the thiazole-benzamide was shown to selectively inhibit p38a (ic50 = 7.1 nm) and block lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx 
production in thp-1 cells (human monocytic cell line) (ic50 =
48 nm). in an in vivo model of acute inflammation in mice,
tak715 inhibited the lps-induced release of  xxxg2296xxx  by 88 %
after a 10 mg kg 1 oral dose. the compound was reported to
have been advanced into phase ii clinical trials.
scios (a subsidiary of johnson & johnson) is developing a
series of small-molecule, orally available, p38 inhibitors. recently the structure of scio-469 (table 6, figure 17) was disclosed
revealing that this molecule belongs to a class of indole
amides explored by the company in a p38 inhibitors development program started from an hts hit: an indole carboxamide
derivative ( xxxd543xxx , figure 17), with weak inhibitory activity for p38a.[141] as shown by data of scio469 and sx011

(figure 17), substitutions at both the 3-position of indole and
the piperazine ring improved potency dramatically. the carbonyl amide forms the crucial hydrogen bond with nh of
met 109 while the polar a-keto amide moiety extends toward
solvent, allowing the 6-cl-indole and the f-phenyl moieties to
bind into lipophilic pockets. scio469 is highly potent against
p38a and p38b (figure 17), blocking the lps-induced release
of  xxxg2296xxx  from human whole blood, and inhibiting lps-induced
il-1b release from human pbmcs in a dose-dependent manner.
a phase i study investigated the safety, pharmacodynamics,
and pharmacokinetics of single ascending oral solution doses
from 0.03 to 5 mg kg 1 scio469 in healthy volunteers. the
compound was safe and well tolerated, the only reported side
effect being mild, transient light-headedness at highest doses
which suggests that scio469 crosses the blood/brain barrier.
by october 2004, a phase ii study to determine the analgesic
efficacy of scio469 in acute post-surgical dental pain had also
been completed. all scio469 treated patients showed a significantly longer time to rescue medication compared with placebo. this study represents the first clinical demonstration of
acute analgesic effects by inhibition of p38.
scios is the first company to disclose clinical exploration of
p38 inhibitors in multiple myeloma (mm). in 2004, scios demonstrated the ability of scio469 to strongly reduce p38 phosphorylation in bone marrow stromal cells, and to inhibit the
production of il-6, vegf, il-1b, receptor of activated  xxxg1559xxx 
ligand, and  xxxd1903xxx . in combination with proteosome
inhibitors, scio469 enhanced the reduction in multiple myeloma cell proliferation and potential proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis. scio469 is at present still under phase ii clinical investigation.
vertex pharmaceutical inc was one of the first companies to
disclose, in 2001, a nonpyridinylimidazole-based p38 inhibitor.
 xxxd3533xxx  (table 6), a first-generation p38 inhibitor, is potent
against p38a (ic50 = 10 nm) and blocks the synthesis of  xxxg2296xxx 
in human whole blood (ic50 = 177 nm)and pbmcs (ic50 = 56 nm)
after lps stimulation in vitro.[135, 137] the compound  xxxd3533xxx 
binds to the atp site of p38a by a hydrogen bond with the
nh of met 109 backbone, whereas the lipophilic “back pocket”
is occupied by the difluorophenyl group.[142]  xxxd3533xxx  was
shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in rodent models and
to penetrate the blood/brain barrier. the compound was generally well tolerated with the most frequently reported adverse
event being elevation in liver transaminases. no cns side effects were seen in humans, however, the drug was subsequently suspended following the observation of neurological
effects in dogs.
vx702 (table 6), the structure of which has not been disclosed, was chosen as a back up compound because of its inability to cross blood/brain barrier. a phase i safety and pharmacokinetic study showed that vx702 (2.5 to 80 mg) was welltolerated. in an ex vivo assay primed with lps, vx702 inhibited
il-6, il-1b and  xxxg2296xxx  production (ic50 = 59, 122 and 99 ng ml 1,
respectively). in a phase iia study completed in october 2004,
vx702 demonstrated safety and tolerability in patients with
acute coronary syndrome (acs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). vx702 significantly reduced serum
chemmedchem 2007, 2, 1116 – 1140

levels of the inflammatory biomarker  xxxg520xxx  (crp)
in patients undergoing pci, and crp remained significantly
lowered up to four weeks after the five-day dosing period.
in june 2005, vertex announced initiation of a three-month,
double blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase ii study
to assess two doses of vx702 in rheumatoid arthritis. the compound will be dosed once daily without concomitant methotrexate.
ketone-based p38 inhibitors have been pursued by multiple
companies. leo pharmaceutical has explored aminobenzophenone p38a inhibitors.[143] the aminobenzophenone eo1606
(table 6) is a potent and selective inhibitor of p38 mapk (isoforms a and b) and of the upstream kinase mkk6. the compound was tested in an animal model of noninflammatory
acne, the rhino mouse. its efficacy in this model is comparable
to that of the retinoids. the compound is at present in clinical
development as agent for atopic dermatitis and acne therapy.
the in vivo models tested were recently reviewed by petersen.[144]
as reported in table 6, additional compounds are undergoing clinical development. glaxosmithkline undertook clinical
development of compounds such as sb-281832, sb-681323,
sb-856553, for which no structures had been to date disclosed.
also centaur, bristol-myers squibb, and kemia are developing
p38 kinase inhibitors that are being clinically evaluated. as a
result of the lack of specific information regarding the development status of those compounds, we chose not to include
them in this review.

7) discussion and conclusion
pharmaceutical companies are facing increasing interest in
new target identification and validation as pointed out by a
recent review.[145] in particular, extensive efforts are being
made in the field of kinase inhibitors research and development and the past ten years of effort in this field have altered
our perception of the potential of kinases as drug targets to
the pharmaceutical industry. therefore, in the drug discovery
process, the selection of relevant, susceptible protein kinase
targets combined with searches for lead drug candidates have
become a crucial approach. it is evident that kinases, which
play an integral part of controlling cellular signalling, would be
of intrinsic interest as potential targets for drug design.
recently, researchers have become especially adept at developing potent protein kinase inhibitors with different activities.
several examples of anticancer therapeutic agents are available, that is, sti-571 (gleevec, imatinib),[146] trastuzumab (herceptin),[147] and the  xxxd1256xxx   xxxd2186xxx  (iressa). numerous
other kinase inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials
or clinical development.
some questions are nevertheless unanswered, mostly related
to the great number of known kinases in the human genome,
to their similarity with each other, to the existence of functionally redundant kinases for specific pathways, and also because
the connection between particular pathways and diseases is
not always clear. this situation is not unique for the kinases,
which are relatively young targets in the drug discovery pro-

cess. similar questions arise for many drug projects, and initially, all of them are unanswered, along with all of the other
normal questions of drug development.
unacceptable safety profiles have been the cause for clinical
attrition of initially promising inhibitors. liver enzyme elevations were reported with  xxxd1929xxx  clinically.[148] the vertex drug,
 xxxd3533xxx , was discontinued because of an unanticipated cns
toxicity in dogs during a six month safety study. unfortunately,
based on the very limited information associated with these
adverse effects, it is impossible to determine the basis of these
issues. nevertheless, several studies had been undertaken to
overcome chemical-based toxicity problems and, particularly in
the case of p38 mapk inhibitors, it is now clear what type of
modifications could result in an improvement.
furthermore, as a consequence of the wide-ranging regulatory roles of kinases in diverse cellular processes, the possibility
of an adverse event resulting from undesired pharmacological
activity is the major concern for protein kinase inhibitor drug
class. added to this are safety issues related to the potential
lack of specificity[31] that plague all kinase inhibitors. how selective is selective enough?
to improve kinase selectivity of certain inhibitors, development of compounds that bind preferentially to the inactive
forms of protein kinases, or which prevent one protein kinase
from activating another, is a promising approach. detailed understanding of the catalytic and regulatory properties of kiachtungrenases can contribute significantly to development of novel
kinase inhibitors including more specific allosteric inhibitors.
specificity problems, as discussed, arise from the evidence that
members of the mapk family share a high degree of conserved
domain structure, particularly in the atp site, and many residues that make contact with p38 inhibitors are conserved
throughout the family. the exception is thr 106, which has
therefore been implicated as a critical determinant for the specificity of these compounds. many results emphasised the critical nature of thr 106 in imparting the good selectivity seen for
p38 inhibitors as a class of compounds binding to the atpbinding site of a kinase.
a second issue concerning activity of atp-competitive inhibitors is the level of activation of the enzyme. in crystal structures of kinases solved with bound atp, the n-terminal domain
and the c-terminal domain work together to form a catalytic
pocket capable of binding all substrates in the proper orientation. in the crystal structure of inactivated p38 however, the
two domains are misaligned, suggesting that atp cannot bind
to inactivated enzyme. the capability of inhibitors to bind
equally well to both the activated and inactivated form of the
enzyme could also represent a good opportunity to develop
inhibitors with enhanced specificity and potency, underscoring
the importance of studies on allosteric inhibitors.
however, we must be aware of the fact that for protein kiachtungrenases, it will be very unlikely to find a unique compound that
specifically inhibits a selected single protein kinase, leaving the
other more than 2500 protein kinases unaffected. the paradigm “one drug, one target, one disease” cannot hold true.
the potential use of protein kinase inhibitors for cancer
treatment is increasing, as reviewed by dancey and saus-

ville.[147] in particular, these authors discuss the need to diagnose the activation state of the kinase target in the tumours of
patients entering clinical trials if the drug is to receive a fair assessment of its capabilities. related to that is the consideration
of when in the course of a tumour’s evolution kinase-directed
drugs are most likely to have an impact. clinical data from
sti571 in cml indicate that kinase inhibitors could have a
great impact on preventing the evolution of tumours to a fully
malignant state, or in treatment of “small volume disease” to
prevent the development of clinically overt metastatic disease.
the therapeutic inactivation of an essential protein kinase creates selective pressures, such that tumour cells evolve a variety
of routes to resistance. these include producing a drug-resistant variant of the targeted protein, substituting its cellular
function by upregulating alternate pathways, and by increasing the expression and function of transporters involved in
drug efflux. a general drawback of target-specific monotherapy therefore derives from the fact that a single genetic alteration conferring target resistance to an individual tumour cell
can eventually lead to relapse. the ability of kinases to mutate
in response to the selective pressure created by drug treatment provides a strong rationale for hitting more than one essential target at the same time in the tumour cells.[149] multitargeted therapy can be achieved with either a combination of
medicines or single promiscuous drugs that act on a set of disease-relevant proteins. protein kinases, which share a relatively
conserved atp-binding site, are amenable to the latter concept
of targeted polypharmacology.
a possible strategy would be to combine agents that target
components in parallel signal transduction pathways, such as a
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor and an
akt inhibitor. ucn-01, which inhibits the activation of akt, and
the mek antagonist ci-1044 ( xxxd1688xxx ), seem to synergistically interact following ucn-01 activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) signalling.[150] of great interest is also
the possibility to combine kinase inhibitors with standard cytotoxic agents.[151, 152]
the idea of treating complex disease such as cancer by
aiming for several targets at once is becoming more accepted,[153] and an increasing number of researcher claimed that
“magic bullet” drugs designed to hit a single target might not
be the answer to treat not only cancer but also cardiovascular
diseases. common disorders tend to result from multiple molecular abnormalities, not from a single defect. drews[154] follows the case histories of five modern drugs ( xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  inhibitors,
natalizumab, imatinib, bevacizumab, and enfurvirtide) as a
basis of reflection on the magic bullets concept and, more in
general, the actual state of drug discovery. imatinib, a good example of a mixed-drug (see figure 18) already discussed in this
survey, represents a landmark in kinase drug discovery and development. the studies and investments undertaken by novartis led not only to a different future for a drug that started
with an “orphan drug” prospective, but also have changed the
perspective on a not very common disease such as chronic
myeloid leukaemia (cml).
from this point of view, the data published by fabian[31]
concerning the specificity profiles for different clinical kinase

figure 18. chemical structure of imatinib.[154] as well as inhibiting the bcrabl kinase, imatinib is a potent inhibitor of c-kit and the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor. ic50 values for inhibition of autophosphorylation are
given.

inhibitors are not so negative. the ambit researchers undertook a study that led to an efficient way to determine kinase
inhibitor specificity by measuring binding of small molecules
to the atp site of kinases.
members of the  xxxg1368xxx  family, like the extracellular
related (erk) and c-jun n-terminal (jnk) kinase families, are
ubiquitously present in all cell types. this evidence combined
with their roles in different processes and in vitro evidences
suggests that there may be other therapeutic uses for p38
kinase inhibitors in addition to their well-known potential for
treatment of classic inflammatory diseases, thus underlying the
need of further exploration of kinase inhibitors potential therapeutic utility. the characteristics that, at the same time, lead to
potential side effects have already been mentioned. dambach[155] from bristol myers squibb recently reviewed those potential side effects that could be associated with inhibition of
p38a/b map kinases. the outcome of this survey indicates
which organs should be closely monitored for the evaluation
of adverse pharmacological effects.
in conclusion, the large body of information currently being
generated around protein kinases as drug targets, coupled
with the significant number of companies pursuing lead compounds, should provide a number of clinical compounds in the
near future. nevertheless, many different aspects must be considered. are protein kinases drug targets?  xxxg2437xxx , but difficult
ones!
