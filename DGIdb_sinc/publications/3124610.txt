 xxxg1173xxx  toxin: a step toward selective immunomodulation.  we have used protein engineering and recombinant dna methodologies to genetically replace the eukaryotic cell receptor binding domain of diphtheria toxin with  xxxg1173xxx  (il-2). the toxin-related  xxxg1173xxx  fusion gene has been cloned in escherichia coli k12. recombinant strains of e coli produce a 68,086 k hybrid toxin, il-2 toxin that retains immunologic properties intrinsic to both its diphtheria toxin and il-2 components. il-2 toxin has been found to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in both human and murine t cell lines that bear high affinity il-2 receptors, whereas the hybrid toxin is not active against cells that do not bear this receptor. the cytotoxic action of il-2 toxin is specifically blocked by free il-2 and monoclonal antibodies that bind to the  xxxd924xxx  ( xxxg1174xxx ) subunit of the high affinity  xxxg1175xxx . in addition, il-2 toxin, like diphtheria toxin itself, must pass through an acidic compartment in order to deliver its  xxxd80xxx  ribosyl transferase activity to the cytosol of target t cells. in a murine delayed type hypersensitivity (dth) model system, we have shown that il-2 toxin treatment induces a marked immunosuppression.
