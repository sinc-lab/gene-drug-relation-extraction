summary-acarbose
is known to inhibit  xxxg1401xxx ,  xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase. our aim was to
test whether it would also inhibit glucosyltransferase
(gtf). to determine the type of inhibition
and to compare the inhibitor potency of acarbose with that of nojirimycin and deoxynojirimytin, two other glucosidase inhibitors. enzyme inhibition was measured either by chemical assay
or by incorporation
of radioactivity into product. acarbose effectively inhibited the synthesis of
polysaccharice
by gtf from strains of struptococcus muruns and streptococcus
sanyuis, but not
by fructosyltransferase
from streptococcus
sulivurius.
acarbose and i - xxxd1955xxx 
were
more potent inhibitors of gtf than maltose, nojirimycin or various amino sugars. the mechanism of action of these compounds is consistent with competitive inhibition.

introduction
to infect a susceptible host. bacteria must be able to
stick to the tissue surface of the host. synthesis of
insoluble glucans is essential for the irreversible
adherence of streptococcus
nwtuns to smooth
hard
surfaces (schachtele, !itaat and harlander, 1975; newbrun, finzen and sharma, 1977; hamada and slade,
1980). furthermore.
the formation of glucan polymers
plays an important role in the accumulation of strep.
mutans on teeth ill citio (gibbons
and van houte,
1975, 1980; montville, cooney and sinskey, 1978;
staat, langley and doyle, 1980). accordingly. inhibiting the synthesis of glucans is a valid approach to
restricting colonization
by this odontopathic
organism. the activity of glucosyltransferase
(gtf, e.c.
2.4.1.5.), the enzyme catalysing glucan synthesis, can
be inhibited
by specific antibodies
(carlsson and
krasse,
1968; klein, scholler
and frank,
1977;
hamada and mizuno,
1979) by pyridoxal-5-phosphate and several otter pyridine analogues (thaniyavarn rt ill., 1982) and by certain xanthene dyes (callaham and heitz, 1977). saccharides, such as maltose
and isomaltose, and low-molecular-weight
dextrans
interfere with the synthesis of insoluble glucans by
acting as alternative acceptors in the gtf-catalysed
reaction, thereby diverting the process to synthesis of
soluble glucans (nesbrun
et ~11..1977; hamada and
torii, 1980) and oligosaccharides
(walker,
1972.
1973). oxidized dextran is also a potent inhibitor of
gtf (ono, nuessle and smith, 1981).
amino sugar derivatives,
synthesized
by some
strains of the order actinomycetales,
especially those
of the family actinoplanaceae,
inhibit the activity of
g-glucosidases
(schmidt et (i/., 1977). those amino
sugar derivatives witl- long oligosaccharide
chains are
primarily
amylase inhibitors,
whereas those with
shorter oligosaccharide
chains act mostly to inhibit
invertase.
one of these derivatives,
acarbose.
a
pseudotetrasaccharide
consisting of an unsaturated

cyclitol unit, a 4-amino-4,6,dideoxyglucose
unit and
two glucose units (fig. i), has pronounced inhibitory
effects on intestinal x-glucosidases
such as sucrase,
 xxxg1401xxx  and  xxxg1401xxx 
(truscheit et u/., 1981).
because its cyclitol unit is structurally similar to the
d-ghcosy1 cation intermediate
formed by the enzymic
splitting of x-glucosides, we hypothesized
that acarbose would inhibit gtf and might interfere with
adherence of strep. muturls (newbrun and walker,
1980). we have investigated the inhibition of gtf
from srrep. muru~~s and strep. surquis by acarbose,
compared
it with inhibition
by maltose, and also
compared the inhibitor potency of acarbose (fig. 1a)
with that of nojirimycin
and i- xxxd1955xxx 
(fig. ib and c), two m- and/or /?-glucosidase inhibitors isolated from the genus bacillus (reese, parrish
and etlinger, 197 1; schmidt er ctl., 1979). norjirimycin
differs from d-glucose only by the substitution
of an
nh group for oxygen in the ring.

added to the culture supernatant,
to a final concentration of 0.02 per cent. the supernate was then concentrated 50-fold (to 40 ml) at 4°c with an amicon@

it was centrifuged at 17,000 g and dialysed overnight
at 4°c in 3 litres of 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer

using the radioactive assay for measuring synthesis
of insoluble glucans, we compared
the inhibition
obtained by acarbose, i- xxxd1955xxx 
and nojirimycin (fig. 4). analysis of the kinetics of these reactions by a lineweaver-burk
plot suggests that l- xxxd1955xxx  is a competitive inhibitor of sucrose in
gtf-catalysed
reactions (fig. 5). the lineweaverburk plot with acarbose, although not ideal, is also

discussion

the mechanism of biosynthesis of bacterial extracellular polysaccharides
involves the insertion of activated monomers or repeating subunits between the
reducing end of the chain and a carrier activator.
robyt, kimble and walseth (1974) proposed that two
nucleophiles at the active site of gtf attack sucrose
to give glucosyl groups covalently linked to the nucleophiles. during synthesis, the two catalytic groups
alternately form covalent complexes with glucose and
glucan. the acceptor reaction can occur both in the
presence or the absence of sucrose, giving either high
molecular weight glucan in the first case or a low
molecular weight oligosaccharide
in the second (e.g.
when maltose is the acceptor). the hydroxyl group on
the acceptor can serve as a nucleophile and displace
the glucosyl and glucanosyl groups from the enzyme
complex, forming an a-glucosidic bond (robyt and
walseth, 1978). when the non-reducing end of glucan
is blocked, gtf activity is not changed; accordingly,
the activation appears not to be a priming mechanism

but involves nucleophilic displacement
to form x-l,3
branch linkages (robyt and corrigan, 1977).
unsaturated
cyclitol units of acarbose
(fig. 1)
resemble the d-glucosyl
cation intermediate formed in
the course of enzymic cleavage of x-glucosides. as we
expected, acarbose is a highly effective inhibitor of
gtf. at 20 mmol/l, synthesis of insoluble glucan was
completely
blocked, whereas maltose at 40 mmol/l
gave only 24 per cent inhibition. it is interesting to
compare acarbose with some amino sugars (methyl 6amino-6-deoxy-p-o-glucopyranoside,
methyl 6-amino6-deoxy-r-d-glucopyranoside
and methyl 6-amino-6deoxy-a-d-mannopyranoside)
that also inhibit gtf
(doyle et al., 1981; thaniyavarn
et al., 1981). to
achieve 8clloo per cent inhibition,
these amino
sugars had to be present  xxxd2274xxx  times the concentration
of the substrate (11.8 mmol/l amino sugar: 1.7 mmol/l
sucrose) and preliminary results suggested so-called
uncompetitive
inhibition. in contrast, acarbose completely inhibited gtf activity at one-fifth the concentration of the substrate.
the gtf preparations
we used were only partially
purified. because they may contain some dextranase
(staat and schachtele, 1974) and the gtf-catalysed
reaction involves complex substrate intermediates,
it
is not surprising that the kinetics do not give perfect
intersections
when plotted graphically. nevertheless,

inhibition of glucosyltransferase

the data for acarbose and i- xxxd1955xxx 
are
compatible with an interpretation of competitive-type
inhibition. gtf inhi~lition has also been measured by
an assay for release of fructose which would not be
affected by dextranase (felgenhauer and trautner,
1981). by this method, i- xxxd1955xxx 
and nmethyldeoxynojirimycin were also shown to be competitive inhibitors. in that study, as in ours, acarbose
did not give clear-cu: competitive intersections.
the cariogenicity of strep. f?~u~~~~s
is related to its
ability to form insoluble glucans. as mutants lacking
this property do not form smooth-surface caries in
rodents infected with these strains (de stoppelaar et
al., 1971; tanzer et crl., 1974). a variety of different
compounds have been studied as potential inhibitors
of gtf, with the hope that an ideal compound could
be found that is safe, cheap and effective in blocking
the coionization of wep. mutans on teeth. acarbose
was originally developed as an a-glucosidase (amylase) inhibitor to limit intestinal digestion of carbohydrate (schmidt et a!., 1977). when it was added to
starch-containing diets (2cl80mg/loog) fed to genetically obese rats, their gain in body weight was
reduced in a dose-dependent fashion (puls et ai.,
1977). in toxicity studies in dogs and rats, no adverse
effects were observecl after administration of acarbose
for 3 months in dos:s up to 450mg/kg body weight
(w. puls, personal communication). use of acarbose
as a dietary cariostatic agent may therefore be limited
to persons who also desire weight reduction or control. however, acarbose could be added to items, such
as chewing gum and candies, that are not eaten for
their caloric value. as yet, acarbose has not been
approved as a food iadditive; it requires further safety
testing and animal studies to determine its efficacy as
a caries-preventive agent.
