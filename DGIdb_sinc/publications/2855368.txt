received august 12, 1986; accepted november 17, 1986

the interaction of naloxone estrone azine (n-eh) with various opioid receptor types was studied in
vitro. its potency as an antagonist of opioid effects was compared to that of naloxone on the electri-
cally evoked contractions of mouse vas deferens (mvd) and guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus longi-
tudinal muscle (gpi) preparations. n-eh was found to be 9-fold more potent than naloxone in antago-
nizing the effects of p-ala?-leu*-enkephalin in the mvd and 22-fold less potent in antagonizing nor-
morphine in the gpi. in the mvd, the recovery half-time for n-eh was longer than 1000 min. neither
compound showed agonism. the two compounds were also compared for their capacity to displace
the binding of 3h-p-ala?-leu*-enkephalin, 3h- xxxd1888xxx , and 3h-ethylketocyclazocine to rat
brain membranes under conditions where delta, mu, and kappa sites were labeled. the relative affin-
ities were 0.70, 0.16, and 0.14 for n-eh and 0.05, 0.87, and 0.08 for naloxone, respectively. thus,
compared to naloxone, which is mu selective, n-eh is a delta-selective antagonist.

introduction

opioid receptors have been pharmacologically classi-
fied into several types (1). mu receptors are characterized as
those to which morphine and the majority of other opiates
show the highest relative affinities. delta receptors interact
preferentially with enkephalins, and kappa receptors with
dynorphins and certain benzomorphans.

investigation of the physiological significance and mo-
lecular properties of different receptor types requires the de-
velopment of type-specific probes. much information can be
obtained by the use of antagonists specifically blocking a
certain receptor type. with opioids, very few compounds
have been identified as reasonably pure antagonists. the
classical antagonist naloxone and its congeners show the
highest affinities at mu receptors (2). a few peptides with
delta-selective antagonist actions have also been described
(3,4). however, peptides suffer drawbacks as in vivo probes
because of metabolic instability and difficulty in crossing the
blood-brain barrier. nonpeptide delta antagonists may be
more suitable for in vivo studies.

we have synthesized opioid—steroid hybrid azines as
potential opioid-receptor probes and found them to show
potent and long-lasting blockade of *h- xxxd1888xxx 
binding in rat brain membranes (5—7). we now describe the
in vitro activities of a hybrid azine that shows enhanced

bioassays

the “‘single-dose’’ method of kosterlitz and watt (9)
was used as described previously (10). bath fluid was krebs
solution at 35°c with 120 mm nacl, 4.75 mm kci, 2.54 mm
 xxxg2125xxx ,, 1.20 mm mgso,, 1.19 mm kh,po,, 25 mm
nahco,, 11 mm p(+)-glucose [for vas deferens prepara-
tions without mg?* (11)], continuously aerated with 95% ox-
ygen, 5% carbon dioxide, giving a ph of 7.4. the prepara-
tions were stimulated with supramaximal rectangular elec-
trical pulses of 60-80 v and 1-msec duration at 0.1 hz.
contractions were measured isometrically with a grass
ft03 transducer and a grass 79 eeg and polygraph re-
corder. the experimental sequence of the single-dose
method is as follows: construction of a dose—response curve
for the agonist (normorphine in gpi, dale in mvd), then
incubation with the test compound for 20 min and addition
of a high dose of the agonist to achieve the combined effect
of the agonist and test compound. thereafter, the prepara-
tion is washed and recovery of agonist effects assayed  xxxd1891xxx -
to 20-min intervals.

binding assays

preparation of rat brain membranes and details of
binding assays were as previously described (7,12). mu-site
affinity was determined using 0.2 nm 7h-dhm, delta-site
affinity using 1 nm 7h-dale with 30 nm dago added to
suppress mu binding, and kkappa-site affinity using 1 nm
3h-(+)-ekc [only (—)-ekc binds at this concentration],
with 200 nm each of dago and dadl added to suppress
mu and delta binding, respectively (12). the amount of
membrane protein was kept constant at 0.2 mg in all assay
tubes. specific binding was defined as that suppressed by a
1000-fold excess of cold ligand; it was above 60% of the total
except for ekc, which was about 25%. k; values were cal-
culated from observed ics0o values (13).

results

n-eh suppressed contractions of the mvd by 20—50%
at all doses tested (25—1000 nm) but this effect was neither
reversed nor inhibited by naloxone at a 10,000 nm concen-
tration and did not occur in the gpi. inhibition of mvd con-
tractions by n-eh was reversed upon washing and appeared

the parent hydrazone eh also had inhibitory actions of a
similar magnitude, although 17-estradiol did not.

the antagonism of dale effects in the mvd and of
normorphine effects in the gpi bioassays by the test com-
pounds is expressed as their apparent dissociation constant
(k.) and the half-times of recovery (t,,) (table i). n-eh was
a potent antagonist of dale effects in the mvd, 9-fold more
potent than naloxone. it was 22-fold less potent than nal-
oxone in the gpi. neither eh nor 17b-estradiol showed
opioid antagonism in either bioassay. n-eh was only
slightly longer acting than naloxone as an antagonist in the
gpi but showed very prolonged action in the mvd. the k, of
n-eh against normorphine in the mvd was also determined
and found to be 27 nm (22.9-—31.5; 95% confidence limits; n
= 7), s-fold higher than against dale, indicating that the
observed selectivity differences were not artifacts caused by
nonopioid effects of n-eh on the mvd. two other opioid-
steroid hybrids, androstene bisnaloxone azine (7,15) and
naltrexone pregnenolone azine (kolb, unpublished), were
also tested (results not shown). these were equipotent to
n-eh as antagonists in the mvd (dale) and gpi (normor-
phine), and both showed some suppression of the mvd, sim-
ilar to n-eh.

the affinities of the two compounds for delta-, mu-, and
kappa-type opioid binding sites were determined in binding
assays designed for studying site selectivity (table ii). n-eh
showed an approximately 7-fold higher affinity than nal-
oxone for delta and 10-fold lower affinity for mu sites;
kappa-site affinity was equal for the two compounds.

discussion

the relative potencies of naloxone in the mvd and the
gpi were close to those observed by others (14), as well as
in binding-site selectivity (2).

the nature of the depression of contractions in the mvd
by the steroid derivatives is unknown; since it was not af-
fected by naloxone, it cannot be opioid. in the ‘‘single-
dose’’ method, calculations of k, values are corrected for
the opioid agonist effects of a test compound. as the de-
pression observed here was not of opioid character, it was

disregarded in k, calculations. the fact that n-eh has dif-
ferent k, values against normorphine in the mvd and gpi
may be due to different proportions of receptor types and,
consequently, normorphine efficacies in the two tissues.

the observation that n-eh is very long-lasting in the
mvd but not in the gpi may be due to preferential interac-
tion with delta receptors in the former preparation. also, by
receptor assay, n-eh dissociates very slowly using 37h-
dhm as the probe (7). it would be of interest to investigate
‘whether this behavior is accentuated using a delta site-selec-
tive probe.

delta-receptor affinity of enkephalins has been sug-
gested to require the hydrophobic phe* residue (16,17).
however, mu-receptor binding also has been related to in-
teractions with this residue, possibly at another receptor do-
main (18). n-eh is a rigid, extended molecule. the only
single bond available for rotation is the azine linkage, which
is in the anticonfiguration at c-6 of naloxone and c-17 of the
steroid (5). studies with cpk space-filling models indicate
that rotation is sterically hindered to about 180° in all config-
urations. n-eh contains two aromatic rings that may in-
teract with the receptor domains that are presumed to in-
teract with the tyr! and phe* residues of enkephalins, re-
spectively. in all allowed conformations of n-eh, the
distance between the centers of the aromatic rings is 16—17
a, and the planes of the two aromatic rings are almost per-
pendicular. in the flexible enkephalins, the distance between
the centers of the aromatic rings in tyr! and phe* can extend
to 18 a. clearly there is potential steric similitude.

another possible reason for the selectivity of n-eh for
delta receptors could be simply the hydrophobicity of the
steroid moiety. interactions of this moiety with hydrophobic
domains in the vicinity of the delta binding site might con-
strain binding of the naloxone moiety to an alignment more
favorable for delta sites. durations of opioid effects in
bioassays have been shown to increase with increasing drug
lipophilicity (19). this, however, cannot be the sole reason
for the long duration of n-eh in the mvd since it is not so
long-acting in the gp.

the naloxone-—steroid hybrid azine described in this
paper represents a new type of delta-receptor probe. to our
knowledge, nonpeptide opioid antagonists selective for delta
receptors have not been reported previously.
