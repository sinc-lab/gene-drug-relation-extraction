key words: amphetamine - - iprindole - - adrenergic receptors

mobley et al. 1° have shown that treatment of rats with amphetamine for 4 days
can reduce the sensitivity of the forebrain cyclic a m p generating system to norepinephrine (ne) stimulation. furthermore, treatment of rats with amphetamine in
combination with iprindole, a drug which inhibits the metabolism of amphetamine 4
and increases its brain concentrations in the rat 6, reduced the time required for this
desensitization to 2 days 9. chronic treatment of rats with antidepressant drugs has
also been shown to decrease the sensitivity of the limbic forebrain camp generating
system to ne stimulation 19, and this effect has been ascribed to a decrease in brain fladrenergic receptor density 1. therefore, it was of interest to us to determine whether
the amphetamine-iprindole effect described above might also be explained by a
decrease in brain fl-receptor density, or perhaps an effect on other receptors.
our results reveal that after 3 days of treatment, while amphetamine or iprindole
administration alone did not alter cortical fl-adrenergic receptors, the combination of
iprindole and amphetamine reduced the density of these receptors. in addition, all 3
drug treatments significantly elevated a2-adrenergic receptor densities but did not
affect the properties of al-adrenergic receptors.
groups of 4 charles river c-d male rats, weighing 230--270 g, were treated
twice daily with amphetamine (10 mg/kg i.p.) and once daily with iprindole (25 mg/kg
i.p.) for 3 days. amphetamine and iprindole were administered at 08.30 h and
amphetamine again at 16.30 h. separate groups were treated with each drug alone on
the same schedule as in the combination study. a water-injected group served as a
control. all rats were sacrificed by decapitation between 08.30 and 09.00 h on the
fourth day and the whole brain was rapidly removed and frozen (--20 °c).
for receptor binding assays, tissues were prepared in the following manner. the

brains were dissected and the samples were thawed, homogenized in 45 ml o f distilled
water and centrifuged at 20,000 × g in a sorvall rcb-2 centrifuge. the supernatants
were discarded and the pellets were resuspended in 45 ml o f distilled water and
centrifuged again. this final pellet was resuspended in cold tris-hc1 buffer ( p h 7.7 at
25 °c) prior to its use in the binding assay. f o r each receptor binding assay,
homogenates o f 5 mg wet weight o f cerebral cortex or 10 mg wet weight o f cerebellum
were applied to each incubation mixture. proteins were measured by the method o f
l o w r y et al. 7.
the following receptor radioligands were used: [ah]wb-4101 to label aladrenergic receptors, [ah] xxxd201xxx  ([ah]pac) to label a2-adrenergic
receptors and [ah]dihydroalprenolol ([3h]dha) to label fl-adrenergic receptors, as
previously described~,s,11,16, is. in the al-adrenergic receptor binding assay, [3h]wb4101 (0.2-1.5 nm) was incubated in culture tubes at 25 °c for 30 min with tissue and
tris.hcl buffer ( p h 7.7 at 25 °c).  xxxd2914xxx  (1 /zm) was added to some o f the
tubes in order to determine specific binding. average specific binding was 65 ~ o f total
binding. in the a2-adrenergic receptor binding assay, [3h]pac (0.1-4 nm) was
incubated at 25 °c for 40 min with tissue and tris.hc1 buffer either in the presence or
absence o f  xxxd2914xxx  (1 #m). the high and low affinity components o f [3h]pac
binding were determined by adding an excess o f n e (10 # m ) to some o f the incubation
tubes for 2 min 16. this allowed for the almost total removal o f low affinity binding.
thus, high affinity binding could be substracted from total binding to obtain the low
affinity c o m p o n e n t o f [ah]pac binding, as previously demonstrated for a2-receptor
binding o f [ah]clonidine 16. specific [ah]pac binding was about 80 ~ o f total binding.
in the fl-adrenergic receptor binding assay, [ a h ] d h a (0.1-1.5 nm) was incubated at
25 °c for 30 min with tissue and tris.hcl buffer in the absence and presence o f ( ± ) propranolol (1/~m). specific [ah]di-ia binding accounted for 80 ~ o f total binding.

the saturation characteristics of rat cerebral cortical fl-adrenergic receptors
were neither affected by 3 days treatment with amphetamine nor iprindole, when these
drugs were administered separately (table i). however, the simultaneous administration of both of these drugs for 3 days induced a 28 ~ decrease in cortical fladrenergic receptor density with no significant alteration in the affinity of the tissue for
[ah]dha. a similar pattern of changes or lack of changes in [ah]dha binding was
observed in the cerebellum (table ii), although in this tissue, unlike the cerebral

conclusion can be drawn as to whether changes in [ah]dha binding in this tissue were
due to a change in bmax or kd.
all 3 drug treatments significantly increased the density of a2-adrenergic
receptors in the cerebral cortex, without affecting the kd values (table i). in a different
series of treated animals, separation of the components of [ah]pac binding into high
and low affinity sites revealed that only the high affinity component of [ah]pac
binding was altered by either amphetamine, or amphetamine plus iprindole, drug
treatment (table iii). these alterations were due to an increase in the bmax of
[3h]pac binding. in these experiments, the increase in both components of [ah]pac
binding caused by iprindole treatment was not significant, although the bmax of total
[ah]pac binding was significantly elevated after this treatment in another series of
animals (table i). [3h]wb-4101 binding in the cerebral cortex was not significantly
affected by any of the various drug treatments described in this study (tables i and ii).
the results of the present study indicate that iprindole can significantly enhance
the ability of amphetamine to down-regulate fl-adrenergic receptors in rat brain.
although, in our study, 3 days of treatment of rats with either amphetamine or iprindole, separately, did not alter cerebral cortical or cerebellar fl-adrenergic receptors,
combined treatment with both of these drugs did reduce cortical fl-adrenergic receptor
density and cerebellar [ah]dha binding. these results suggest that the subsensitivity
of noradrenergic receptors seen after amphetamine-iprindole treatment as reported by
mainer et al. 9 could be due to decreased receptor density. the enhanced activity of the
combination may be the result of prolonging the action of amphetamine or attenuating the amounts of interfering amphetamine metabolities 1° through blockade of the
metabolism of amphetamine by iprindole, though a more direct effect of iprindole
cannot be ruled out.
in contrast to the changes in fl-adrenergic receptor density reported here, a2adrenergic receptor density increased but no change in al-receptor density was seen in
the cerebral cortex after each type of drug treatment. at present, the physiological
significance of [3h]pac binding sites in the brain is unclear. in peripheral tissues, a2adrenergic receptors are believed to be presynaptically located on ne-containing
terminals and act to modulate the release of ne 12. in the cerebral cortex, there exists a
significant population of a2-adrenergic receptors which appears to be located postsynaptic to ne-containing terminals, whereas no ne-terminal 'presynaptic' a2-receptors
sites were demonstrated 14,16. whether this implies a different functional role for a~adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and periphery is not known. there is,
indeed, increasing evidence for the existence of peripheral a2-receptors not located on
sympathetic terminal membranes2,13, ~7. it is, however, of interest, and of possible
therapeutic importance, that a2-adrenergic receptor density is elevated in the cerebral
cortex after the combined drug treatment, whereas fl-adrenergic receptor density is decreased. similar findings of reciprocal cortical adrenergic receptor modulation have
recently been obtained in vitro and in vivo. maggi et al. s treated rat cortical slices with
 xxxd2401xxx  and induced a decrease in fl-adrenergic receptor density and an increase
in a~-adrenergic receptor density. these authors have suggested that in the cortex,
postsynaptic fl- and a2-adrenergic receptors are linked in some manner, so that alter-

591
ations in the characteristics of one type of receptor induce opposite changes in the other.
although the present in vivo results resemble the findings of maggi et al. s, in some respects our results do not entirely support their proposal. this is seen by the lack of alterations in cerebral cortical fl-adrenergic receptors after either amphetamine or iprindole treatment despite a2-adrenergic receptor changes. it is possible that, because of
their physiological role, a2-adrenergic receptors are more rapidly adaptable to changes
in ne or other agonist levels at the adrenergic synapse than fl-adrenergic receptors,
and, therefore, are able to be affected by these drug treatments at a time when an observable change in fl-adrenergic receptors has yet to occur. in this connection, it
should be noted that the increase in cortical a2-receptors observed by maggi et al. s
during  xxxd2401xxx  incubation is earlier in onset than the decrease in fl-adrenergic
receptors. similarly, in other in vivo studies, u'prichard and kvetnansky 15 found that
chronic immobilization stress in rats decreased cortical fl-adrenergic receptor number
and increased cortical a~-adrenergic receptor levels. however, acute stress did not
affect cortical fl-adrenergic receptors, but still elevated a~-adrenergic receptor density.
finally, the order of sensitivity to change of the brain adrenergic receptors demonstrated in the present study is consistent with studies of brain receptor changes
following denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine. after the intracerebral administration of the neurotoxin, no receptor changes were seen in 8 days 5, a 23 ~o increase in
[sh]clonidine binding and an 8 ~o increase in [sh]wb-4101 binding after 10-14 days 16
and a marked increase in al-, as- and fl-adrenergic receptors after 30 days 14.
it is important to note, however, that the changes in all 3 receptors following
structural denervation were in the same direction whereas, in the present experiments,
differential effects were produced. it is possible that the drug treatments used here alter
the concentrations of substances other than n e at the adrenergic synapse and that
these substances might be important factors in controlling the sensitivity of brain
adrenergic receptors. thus, either metabolites of amphetamine, as proposed by
money et al 1°, or metabolites of n e might significantly modulate the characteristics
of cerebral cortical adrenergic receptors.
