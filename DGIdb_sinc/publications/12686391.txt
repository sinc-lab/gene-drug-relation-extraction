mifepristone or inhibition of 11beta-hydroxylase activity potentiates the sedating effects of the cannabinoid receptor-1 agonist delta(9)-tetrahydr...  the cannabinoid system is a regulator of neurotransmission and is linked with hormonal control. we have found in experimental mouse studies that the  xxxg1737xxx  inhibitor mifepristone ( xxxd2643xxx , 80 mg/kg i.p.) or the 11beta-hydroxylase inhibitor  xxxd2633xxx  (100 mg/kg i.p.) when administered in combination with cannabinoids potentiates the transient-sedating cannabinoid receptor-1 effects of a high-dose delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (25 mg/kg i.p.), causing severe prolonged sedation associated with hypomotility, catalepsy and hypothermia. this observation has implications for human subjects taking these drugs and related compounds particularly because of the ubiquitous use of cannabis and the high potential for mifepristone and related compounds to become available on the 'black-market' as abortifacients.
