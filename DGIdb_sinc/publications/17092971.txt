abstract
aripiprazole, (+)terguride, opc-4392 and (–)3-ppp have been classified as
 xxxg656xxx  partial agonists based largely on their activity in
second messenger-based assays of  xxxg656xxx  signalling.
nevertheless, signal transduction amplification might result in these
compounds behaving as  xxxg656xxx  full agonists at a more
downstream level of signalling. we compared the intrinsic activity (emax,
expressed as a percentage of the maximal effect of dopamine) of
aripiprazole, (+)terguride, opc-4392 and (–)3-ppp using second (calcium
(ca2+) mobilization) and third ( xxxg1366xxx 
( xxxg1366xxx ) phosphoprotein expression) messenger readouts of cloned human
dopamine d2long (hd2l) receptor signalling in cho cells. these compounds
were all less potent and displayed lower intrinsic activity in the ca2+
assay (aripiprazole = 24.3%, (+)terguride = 56.9%, opc-4392 = 58.6% and
(–)3-ppp = 75.1%), and aripiprazole (emax = 54.5%) displayed a
substantially lower intrinsic activity than (+)terguride (emax = 92.3%),
opc-4392 (emax = 93.1%) and (–)3-ppp (emax = 101.1%) in the more

downstream-based  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression assay. these drug
effects on ca2+ mobilization and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression
were mediated through dopamine hd2l receptors, as they all were
blocked by (–)raclopride, whereas (–)raclopride and other dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists (haloperidol, risperidone, ziprasidone, olanzapine,
clozapine and quetiapine) were inactive on their own in both assays.
these data are consistent with clinical evidence that only dopamine d2
receptor partial agonists with a sufficiently low enough intrinsic activity
will prove effective against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and
also highlight the importance of using downstream-based assays in the
discovery of novel  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist therapeutics.

 xxxg656xxx  partial agonists 621

introduction
dopamine d2 receptors are members of the g-protein-coupled
receptor (gpcr) family that have proven to be important targets
for pharmaceuticals used in the management of schizophrenia,
parkinson’s disease and drug abuse.  xxxg656xxx  antagonism is commonly considered to be an essential element of
antipsychotic drug activity (dean and scarr, 2004). nevertheless,
arvid carlsson was the first to propose, based on his experiments
with (–)-3-(3-hydroxy-phenyl)-n-n-propylpiperidine ((–)3-ppp),
that  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists might also possess
antipsychotic properties (clark et al., 1985a, b). clinical trials
with (–)3-ppp showed improvements in the positive and negative
symptoms of schizophrenia after 1 week of treatment, although
(–)3-ppp was found to be ineffective after 2 and 3 weeks of treatment (lahti et al., 1988). this lack of sustained clinical efficacy
was partly attributed to the intrinsic activity of (–)3-ppp. in accordance with this hypothesis, when (–)3-ppp was administered in
combination with a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, to effectively
lower the intrinsic activity of (–)3-ppp, the resultant duration of
efficacy extended beyond that of (–)3-ppp monotherapy
(tamminga, 2002). subsequent small-sized clinical trials were
later conducted with other  xxxg656xxx  partial
agonists, including n-[(8-alpha)-2-chloro-6-methylergoline-8-yl]2,2-dimethylopropanamide (sdz 208-912), which demonstrated
limited improvements against the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia, as well as (+)terguride and 7-{3-[4-(2,3dimethylphenyl)-piperazinyl]propoxy:-2(1h)-quinolinone (opc4392), both of which were effective only against the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia (see benkert et al., 1995). a close
structural analogue of opc-4392, 7-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1piperazinyl]butoxy:- xxxd1818xxx )-quinolinone (aripiprazole),
is the first  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist to be approved as
an effective treatment for the positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (kane et al., 2002).
aripiprazole, (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride and opc-4392 have been
classified as  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists, based primarily on their in vitro functional characteristics in second messenger-based assays (inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenosine
3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (camp) accumulation and stimulation
of  xxxd208xxx  release) of  xxxg656xxx  signalling
(lawler et al., 1999; burris et al., 2002; jordan et al., 2004b;
tadori et al., 2005), and in the case of aripiprazole these data are
in agreement with its in vivo pharmacological profile in rodent
models of  xxxg656xxx  activity (fujikawa et al., 1996;
jordan et al., 2004a; kikuchi et al., 1995). these in vitro studies
showed that aripiprazole has a lower intrinsic activity than (–)3ppp, (+)terguride and opc-4392, which is in agreement with clinical evidence that predicts a sufficiently low intrinsic activity is
required for  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists to produce
long-term efficacy against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
however, the intrinsic activity of aripiprazole and these other compounds has not been studied at a level of  xxxg656xxx 
signalling downstream to that provided using second messengerbased readouts. such studies are necessary, as the possibility exists

that these compounds might display higher intrinsic activity at
progressively lower levels of the  xxxg656xxx  signalling,
as a result of signal transduction amplification (baker et al., 2003;
neve et al., 2004). similarly, signal transduction amplification
would account for the lower intrinsic activity of aripiprazole, (–)3ppp, (+)terguride, and opc-4392 in a guanosine-5'-o-(3[35s]thio)-triphosphate ([35s]gtps) binding assay, compared
with their downstream activities in second messenger-based assays
(e.g.  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation and [3h] xxxd208xxx  release) conducted using the same chinese hamster
ovary (cho) cell line expressing cloned human d2long receptors
(cho-hd2l cells; jordan et al., 2004b).
activation of dopamine d2 receptors liberates the g subunit
of the gi class of g-proteins to stimulate phospholipase-c-induced
increases in intracellular calcium (ca2+), which ultimately lead to
downstream activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (mapk) extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase 2 ( xxxg1366xxx ) (choi et al., 1999; yan et al., 1999; takeuchi and
fukunaga, 2003; neve et al., 2004). the present study used confocal laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy and an
immunoblotting procedure as respective measures of ca2+ mobilization and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression in cho-hd2l cells.
a major aim of this study was to determine whether aripiprazole
possesses a lower intrinsic activity than (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride and
opc-4392, in a second and third messenger-based assay of
dopamine hd2l receptor signalling, as might be predicted by the
clinical hypothesis that  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist-based antipsychotics require a sufficiently low enough intrinsic activity to
produce sustained improvements against the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia. the antipsychotic  xxxg656xxx  antagonists haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone
and quetiapine were also studied in these assays to see whether, as
a result of signal transduction amplification, they might display a
low, albeit detectable, level of intrinsic activity in the  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression assay.

that was used to transfect cho cells. cho cells that stably
expressed cloned human d2long receptors (cho-hd2l cells), at a
density (bmax) of 4.0 pmol/mg protein, were cultured in f-12
ham medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1% hypoxanthine-thymidine supplement,
0.5%  xxxd2191xxx  selection agent and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic. chohd2l cells were maintained at 37 °c in an atmosphere of 5% co2
and passaged, or harvested for use in the in vitro functional assays,
when ~80% confluent using a non-enzymatic cell-dissociation
buffer.

confocal laser-scanning microscopy
cho-hd2l cells were plated (300,000 cells/chamber) in poly-llysine (0.001% (w/v)) precoated nunc lab-tek ii2 chambered
slides, incubated at 37 °c for 17–24 h and then washed twice with
dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (dpbs). cells were then
incubated under aluminum foil at room temperature for 75 min in
fluorescent loading solution (4 µm fluo-3am and 0.066%
pluronic f-127 diluted in dpbs), washed twice with dpbs and
incubated in darkness at room temperature for 30 min prior to
being exposed to vehicle or test drug treatments. a confocal laserscanning microscope (488 nm argon laser using lp505 emission
filter and 20 lens magnification) was used to capture digital
images of fluorescently labelled intracellular ca2+ at 5 sec intervals before and during vehicle and drug treatments. calibrated
densitometric image analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity in
each image was used to monitor vehicle and drug treatment effects
on intracellular ca2+ mobilization.

 xxxg1366xxx  immunoblotting
cho-hd2l cells were incubated for ~24 h at 37 °c in serum-free
f-12 culture media and then for 15 min in serum-free f-12 media
containing vehicle and each test compound. all reactions were terminated by rinsing the cells in ice-cold pbs and cells were then
lysed in 50 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm edta,
1.5 mm mgcl2, 10% glycerol, 1% triton-x-100, 1.25 mm
na3vo4, 2% protein inhibitor cocktail, 1 mm pmsf and 100 mm
naf. the resultant cell lysates were vortexed for 15 sec, stored on
wet ice for 30 min, and centrifuged (14 000 rpm  20 min at
4 °c) to generate a supernatant that was stored at –80°c. cell
lysate protein concentrations were determined using a bradford
assay (sigma chemical co., st louis, mo). cell lysates were
boiled in laemmli buffer (62.5 mm tris, 7.5% glycerol, 2%
sodium  xxxd3215xxx , bromophenol blue and 2.5% 2-- xxxd26xxx ) and double distilled water for 4 min, briefly centrifuged,
and then separated on a 4–20% sds-polyacrylamide gel (bio-rad
laboratories, hercules, ca). cell lysates (15 µg protein) were run
at 100 v for 2 h and a pvdf membrane was used for protein
transfer. a primary antibody (polyclonal anti-active® mapk,
rabbit, diluted 1:1000; promega corporation, madison, wi) that
specifically targets phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx  (44 kda) and  xxxg1366xxx 
(42 kda) was used in conjunction with a secondary antibody (goat
anti-rabbit igg hrp, diluted 1:5000; sigma chemical co.) to
detect phosphorylated  xxxg1366xxx . blots were incubated with ecl

detection reagent (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj) for
1 min and then exposed to kodak x-omat film (sigma chemical
co.) for 1–5 min. vehicle and test compound-induced changes in
 xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein were detected by calibrated densitometric
analysis (scion image for windows software, scion corporation,
frederick, md) of digitized images of  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein on
each western blot.

data analysis
drugs were tested in triplicate at increasing concentrations in the
ca2+ mobilization (0.1 nm to 10 µm) and  xxxg1366xxx  immunoblotting
(0.001 nm to 1 µm) assays, and non-linear regression analysis
(sigmoidal
dose–response
model)
of
each
set
of
concentration–effect data was performed using graphpad prism
version 3.0 for windows (graphpad software, san diego, ca), to
estimate the potency (pec50 ± standard error of the mean (sem))
and intrinsic activity (emax, maximal drug effect expressed as a
percentage of the effect of a maximally effective concentration of
dopamine on ca2+ mobilization (10 µm dopamine) and  xxxg1366xxx 
phosphoprotein expression (1 µm dopamine)). the mean in vitro
potency and intrinsic activity of each drug was calculated from
three to five representative experiments for each assay. this software application was also used to perform an f test to ensure best
fit modelling of each set of concentration–effect data. all drugs
which displayed activity in either assay were tested at a single
active concentration in the presence of (–)raclopride (10 µm) to
determine whether their activity was specifically mediated through
dopamine hd2l receptors.

results
confocal laser-scanning microscopy
representative images of the maximal effects of vehicle and each
drug treatment on basal cho-hd2l cell ca2+ mobilization are
shown in fig. 1. dopamine, aripiprazole, (+)terguride, opc-4392
and (–)3-ppp were the only compounds to induce detectable ca2+
mobilization, and their concentration–response curves are shown
in fig. 2. dopamine mobilized intracellular ca2+ with greater
potency (pec50 = 8.17 ± 0.09) than aripiprazole (pec50 = 7.15 ±
0.41), (+)terguride (pec50 = 7.35 ± 0.12), opc-4392 (pec50 =
7.25 ± 0.16) and the weakly potent (–)3-ppp (pec50 = 6.50 ±
0.13). a statistical comparison (one-way analysis of variance
(anova) followed by bonferroni’s multiple comparison test)
between the intrinsic activity of these drugs revealed that aripiprazole mobilized intracellular ca2+ (emax = 24.3 ± 7.6% of the
maximal effect of 10 µm dopamine) up to a significantly lesser
extent than dopamine (emax = 99.3 ± 3.2%, p < 0.001), (+)terguride (emax = 56.9 ± 2.4%, p < 0.01), opc-4392 (emax = 58.6 ±
6.8%, p < 0.01) and (–)3-ppp (emax = 75.1 ± 7.5%, p < 0.001). in
contrast, 1 µm concentrations each of haloperidol, risperidone,
ziprasidone, olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine were without
effect. in addition to this, the ability of single active concentrations

(+)terguride (100 nm) and opc-4392 (100 nm) to mobilize intracellular ca2+ was completely blocked in the presence of (–)raclopride (10 µm), which did not affect ca2+ mobilization on its own.
representative data from a single experiment showing the effects
of 100 nm dopamine and 100 nm aripiprazole each in the presence and absence of (–)raclopride are shown in fig. 3. the small
reduction in intracellular ca2+ mobilization observed in response
to both vehicle and (–)raclopride was typically seen in response
to all vehicle and inactive drug treatments, and therefore this effect
is likely to be an artefact of the vehicle/drug administration
procedure.

phosphoprotein within the linear portion of our calibrated standard
curve. aripiprazole (ec50 = 9.39 ± 0.33), (+)terguride (ec50 =
9.73 ± 0.29), and opc-4392 (ec50 = 8.30 ± 0.20) increased  xxxg1366xxx 
phosphoprotein expression with high potency, whereas (–)3-ppp
(ec50 = 7.08 ± 0.07) and dopamine (ec50 = 7.58 ± 0.18) were moderately potent in this respect (fig. 4). a statistical analysis (one-way
anova, followed by bonferroni’s multiple comparison test) of the
intrinsic activity of these compounds revealed that aripiprazole
increased  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression (emax = 54.5% ± 5.9 of
the effect of a maximally effective concentration (1 µm) of
dopamine) up to a significantly lesser extent than (+)terguride
(emax = 92.3% ± 8.3, p < 0.05), opc-4392 (emax = 93.1% ± 7.6,
p < 0.05), (–)3-ppp (emax = 101.1% ± 4.2, p < 0.01) and dopamine
(emax = 101.2% ± 9.3, p < 0.01). the dopamine hd2l receptor full
agonist profiles of dopamine and (–)3-ppp in this assay were
detected within the linear range of our calibrated standard curve.
lower concentrations of dopamine and (–)3-ppp treated cell lysates
were also studied, and the resultant data confirmed that the unexpected full agonist activity of (–)3-ppp was not the result of a ceiling
effect in our immunoblotting detection and image analysis procedure. in contrast,  xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation was unaffected by
1 µm concentrations of haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and ziprasidone, and 10 µm (–)raclopride completely blocked the activity of a single active concentration of
aripiprazole, (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride, opc-4392 and dopamine on
 xxxg1366xxx  phosphorylation, whilst being inactive on its own (fig. 5).
interestingly, all active drugs tested on this study exhibited significantly lower potency (aripiprazole, p = 0.005; (–)3-ppp, p = 0.002;
(+)terguride, p < 0.0001; opc-4392, p = 0.004; dopamine,

figure 4 effects of increasing concentrations of dopamine, aripiprazole,
(+)terguride, opc-4392 and (–)3-ppp on  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression
in cho-hd2l cell lysates. all data points are expressed as a percentage of
a maximally effective concentration (1 µm) of dopamine and represent
the mean effect (±sem) of each drug concentration studied on three
(aripiprazole and opc-3492), four (dopamine and (+)terguride) or five
((–)3-ppp) different occasions.

aripiprazole, (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride, and opc-4392 behave as
 xxxg656xxx  partial agonists in second messenger-based
assays of  xxxg656xxx  signalling (lawler et al., 1999;
burris et al., 2002; jordan et al., 2004b). the effectiveness of aripiprazole as a treatment for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
(kane et al., 2002) might be related to it having a lower intrinsic
activity than other  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists, including (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride and opc-4392, which are clinically
ineffective in this respect. the potency and intrinsic activity of all
of these compounds in the ca2+ mobilization assay was comparable to their respective activities in this and other second messengerbased assays ( xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp accumulation and
[3h] xxxd208xxx  release) performed using the same chohd2l cell line (jordan et al., 2004b; jordan et al., 2006). however,
aripiprazole, (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride and opc-4392 displayed
greater potency and higher intrinsic activity at a more downstream
level (phosphorylation of  xxxg1366xxx ) of  xxxg656xxx 
signalling, a finding that is consistent with the phenomenon of
signal transduction amplification. interestingly, in this regard, aripiprazole displayed a significantly lower intrinsic activity

are all consistent with the hypothesis that aripiprazole is the only
one of these compounds to provide long-term benefits against the
positive symptoms as a result of its lower intrinsic activity at
dopamine d2 receptors. the present assays provided specific readouts of drug effects on dopamine hd2l receptor-mediated signal
transduction, as the effects of dopamine, aripiprazole, (+)terguride,
opc-4392 and (–)3-ppp in both assays were all completely
blocked by the  xxxg656xxx  antagonist (–)raclopride,
which on its own was inactive in both assays. in contrasting comparison, the antipsychotics haloperidol, risperidone, ziprasidone,
olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine all failed to affect ca2+
mobilization or  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression in cho-hd2l
cells, in accordance with their common classification as dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  antagonists (reynolds, 2004).
the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are commonly associated with excessive tone at mesolimbic postsynaptic dopamine d2
receptors (meltzer and stahl, 1976). our data predict that aripiprazole, acting as a  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist, might function as an agonist at presynaptic dopamine d2 receptors, where
receptor reserve and low endogenous dopamine tone exist, and as
an antagonist at postsynaptic dopamine d2 receptors, which have
little or no receptor reserve and a relatively high endogenous
dopamine tone (meller et al., 1987; yokoo et al., 1988; pliska,
1999). this proposed mechanism of action of aripiprazole at
dopamine d2 receptors might underlie its sustained efficacy
against the positive symptoms. in contrast, on the basis that opc4392 displayed a substantially higher intrinsic activity than aripiprazole in the current study, opc-4392 might be expected to
function at pre- and postsynaptic dopamine d2 receptors in a
manner closer to that of dopamine, a prediction that could explain
its lack of efficacy against the positive symptoms.
the marked difference in intrinsic activity between aripiprazole
and opc-4392 at dopamine d2 receptors, as a potential contributing factor to their contrasting effects on positive symptoms, is of
interest, considering the close structural and pharmacological
similarities between these compounds. in addition to their high
binding affinity for dopamine d2 receptors, aripiprazole and opc4392 both also bind with high affinity to and behave as partial agonists and antagonists at serotonin 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors,
respectively (byars et al., 2002; jordan et al., 2002, 2004b). these
additional interactions of aripiprazole and opc-4392 have the
potential to regulate forebrain dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal function, and should therefore be considered in attempts to
explain the broad effectiveness of aripiprazole as an antipsychotic
compared with opc-4392, the efficacy of which is limited to producing improvements only against negative symptoms of schizophrenia. further research is required to identify possible
differences between aripiprazole and opc-4392 on additional biochemical components of the signal transduction processes that are
associated with dopamine d2 and other receptors that regulate
midbrain and forebrain neuronal function.
(–)3-ppp is generally classified as a  xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist; in vitro and in vivo, this compound has a similar

profile on indirect biochemical indices of intrinsic activity (lahti
et al., 1992). additional experiments are required to determine
whether a  xxxg656xxx  full agonist profile can be
demonstrated for (–)3-ppp in additional downstream assays of
 xxxg656xxx  signalling, such as that provided by our
 xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression assay. amplification of (–)3ppp-induced  xxxg656xxx  signalling might contribute to
the  xxxg656xxx  partial and full agonist profiles of this
compound in our assays, and the high intrinsic activity of this
compound might explain its unsuitable clinical profile as an
antipsychotic, as originally speculated by tamminga (2002).
further pre-clinical research will hopefully strengthen the hypothetical relationship between intrinsic activity at dopamine d2, and
other receptors for that matter, and the clinical profiles of
 xxxg656xxx  partial agonist-based antipsychotic drug
candidates. in the meantime, it will be interesting to follow the
clinical outcome of  xxxg656xxx  partial agonists, such as
 xxxd336xxx  ( xxxd336xxx ), with respect to their intrinsic activity at
dopamine d2 receptors.
antipsychotic drugs produce effects on  xxxg1366xxx , ca2+ and other
signal transduction elements that regulate neuronal growth, survival and neurogenesis (gnegy, 2000; sweatt, 2001; kontkanen
et al., 2002; lu and dwyer, 2005) and, in the case of  xxxg1366xxx , are
expressed at different densities in some schizophrenic brain
regions (kyosseva, 2004). the clinical benefits of these drugs
might therefore represent a neuroadaptative response generated by
a sustained change in intracellular signalling. while ca2+ mobilization and  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein expression provide a biochemical means of comparing the intrinsic activity of dopaminergic
drugs at dopamine d2l receptors in cho-hd2l cells, further
studies are required to see whether ca2+ mobilization might serve
as a biomarker of brain  xxxg656xxx  agonist activity,
especially since activated dopamine d2 receptors have no effect or
opposite effects on intracellular ca2+ in different cell lines (hernandez-lopez et al., 2000; lee et al., 2004; jomphe et al., 2006).
aripiprazole, as well as the other antipsychotics studied herein,
bind with high to moderate affinity to dopamine d2, 1- and 2adrenergic and serotonin 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a subtypes, and other
g-protein-coupled receptors (richelson and souder, 2000; jordan
et al., 2002; shapiro et al., 2003) that affect  xxxg1366xxx  and ca2+ signalling in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines and in rodent brain
tissue (chen et al., 2002; cussac et al., 2002; vanhoose et al.,
2002; pozzi et al., 2003; lu et al., 2004; browning et al., 2005; lu
and dwyer, 2005). the net effect of each antipsychotic drug on
erk and ca2+ signalling pathways therefore probably represents a
composite response to its collective activities at multiple receptors.
for instance, ziprasidone, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and
risperidone, but not haloperidol, increase  xxxg1366xxx  phosphoprotein
expression by activating cloned human serotonin 5-ht1a receptors
expressed in cho (cho-h5-ht1a) cells (cussac et al., 2002).
interestingly, these data suggest that  xxxg1366xxx  activation might
contribute to the neuroprotectant activity displayed by clozapine,
olanzapine and aripiprazole, but not haloperidol, in mice, as these
drug effects were fully or, in the case of clozapine, partly blocked
by a serotonin  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist (cosi et al., 2005).
however, further studies are required to determine whether or not

 xxxg656xxx  partial agonists

this is the case, as individual receptors do not always have the
same effects on  xxxg1366xxx  activity in non-neuronal and neuronal cell
lines and brain tissue. for instance, in contrast to their effects on
 xxxg1366xxx  in cho-h5-ht1a cells, serotonin 5-ht1a receptors have
been shown to inhibit  xxxg1366xxx  activity in certain brain regions (chen
et al., 2002). contrasting effects of an individual receptor on signalling proteins might be expected due to differences in
receptor–effector coupling and signal transduction protein expression across different cell lines and brain regions. brain tissue
microarray and other studies are ongoing in our laboratory, using
receptor-selective antagonists, to determine the effects of aripiprazole on  xxxg1366xxx  and other signal-transduction-related proteins that
have the capacity to provoke neuroadaptive changes in the brain.
these studies are part of an ongoing effort to broaden our understanding of the mechanism of action of aripiprazole as a neurotherapeutic and to explain why not all  xxxg656xxx 
partial agonists are as effective as antipsychotics.
collectively, the present data demonstrate that aripiprazole displays a markedly lower intrinsic activity than (–)3-ppp, (+)terguride and opc-4392 on second and third messengers of
dopamine hd2l receptor signalling. these data are consistent with
the hypothesis that low intrinsic activity at this receptor might be a
critical determinant of the clinical effectiveness of aripiprazole
and future  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist-based antipsychotics. our demonstration that certain compounds, such as (–)3ppp, yield progressively higher levels of intrinsic activity at more
downstream levels of  xxxg656xxx  signalling, suggests
the inclusion of third messenger and other downstream readouts in
attempts to discover and develop novel  xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist-based therapeutics.
