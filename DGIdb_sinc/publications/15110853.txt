abstract—a series of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating adamantyl moieties were prepared by reaction of aromatic/
heterocyclic aminosulfonamides with the acyl chlorides derived from adamantyl-1-carboxylic acid and 1-adamantyl-acetic acid.
related derivatives were obtained from the above-mentioned aminosulfonamides with adamantyl isocyanate and adamantyl isothiocyanate, respectively. some of these derivatives showed good inhibitory potency against two human ca isozymes involved in
important physiological processes, ca i, and ca ii, of the same order of magnitude as the clinically used drugs acetazolamide and
 xxxd2592xxx . the lipophilicity of the best ca inhibitors was determined and expressed as their experimental log k 0 iam and
theoretical clogp value. their lipophilicity was propitious with the crossing of the blood-brain barrier (log k 0 iam > 1.35). the
anticonvulsant activity of some of the best ca inhibitors reported here has been evaluated in a mes test in mice. after intraperitoneal injection (30 mg kg1 ), compounds a8 and a9 exhibited a high protection against electrically induced convulsions
(>90%). their ed50 was 3.5 and 2.6 mg kg1 , respectively.

1. introduction
epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized
by seizures generated by the sudden, massive, synchronous excitation of neurons in the brain. in general, the
amplitude of seizure can range from brief cessation of
responsiveness (absence seizure) to severe tonic-clonic
muscle spasms with a loss of consciousness (general
seizure).1–3 several generations of anticonvulsants are
available, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, benzodiazepines,  xxxd2056xxx , carbamazepine, and valproic

acid (valproate) among others. their use was also
proved useful in the treatment of other diseases such as
neuropathic pain and bipolar disorders, conditions
associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality.4–8
the newest generation of anticonvulsants, including
vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, tiagabine, topiramate,  xxxd2090xxx ,  xxxd3564xxx , or  xxxd2809xxx , represents a step forward toward better anticonvulsant
drugs.9–12 nowadays the marketed anticonvulsants are
estimated to be eﬀective in approximatively 90% of the
epileptic patients. however, their use is associated with
dose-related toxicity and idiosyncratic side eﬀects, and
the presently available drugs should thus be optimized.9–12
beside its ability to block the voltage naþ -channel, to
potentiate gabaergic transmission and to block the
kainate/ xxxg981xxx , topiramate tpm occupies a

particular place among new anticonvulsants due to its
ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase.13–20 the enzyme,
catalyzing the interconversion of co2 and hco
3 is
quite abundant in the brain, being present in the glia and
neurons, mainly as the cytosolic isozymes ca ii, ca vii
and the membrane-bound isoform ca xiv.16–18;21
although their function in the brain was not well
established, it is known that these proteins are involved
in the secretion of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (csf), being
present in the choroid plexus of vertebrates in high
amount.16–18;21;22 it also has been proven that inhibition
of the brain cas increases the cerebral blood ﬂow with
the concomitant raising of the co2 partial pressure.16;22
kaila and co-workers,23–26 rivera et al.,27 and grover
et al.28 revealed that ca inhibition might serve as an
anticonvulsant mechanism (at least in some forms of
epilepsy), taking into account that the contribution of
hco
3 current to the ionic current through c-aminobutirate a (gabaa ) receptors on dendrites is increased
during periods of high-frequency receptor activation.
the excitatory eﬀect of hco
3 is blocked by membranepermeant ca inhibitors.14;25;28

also showed promising in vivo anticonvulsant properties.30 considering the last derivative as lead compound,
we decided to further investigate this class of compounds. we report here a new series of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating the adamantyl
moiety in their molecule, as well as their ca inhibitory and anticonvulsant properties in the mes test in
rats.

2.1. chemistry
the chemical structures of sulfonamides 1–9 on which
the adamantyl-containing moieties a–d have been
attached are shown below. these new sulfonamides
obtained by attaching moieties a–d of to the amino/
imino group of sulfonamides 1–9 will be designated
as (a–d) 1–9 (chart 1), as for other such derivatives
synthesized by means of the tail approach.18;33;34
two synthetic approaches have been used for the
preparation of the new sulfonamides reported here: (i)
reaction of 1-adamantyl carboxylic acid or 1-adamantylacetic acid chlorides with sulfonamides 1–9 in the
presence of a base, as reported previously by this
group,33;34 leading to amides a1–a9 and b1–b9, and (ii)
reaction of adamantyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate with
sulfonamides 1–9, leading to derivatives c1–c9 and d6,

classical ca inhibitors (cais) such as acetazolamide
aza and  xxxd2592xxx  mza have been used for
decades as anticonvulsants18;29a although they occupy a
marginal role in therapy at present.29b generally, the
lipophilicity improve brain penetration of the drug, so
that  xxxd2592xxx  mza or the lipophilic tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative of acetazolamide tboc-aza are
more eﬀective as anticonvulsants than acetazolamide,
which is very hydrophilic.29 a similar eﬀect is observed
in the case of  xxxd3564xxx  zns, a derivative for which the
ca inhibitory properties have not been investigate in
detail.18 considering the interesting anticonvulsant
activity of several cais, a series of aromatic/heterocyclic
sulfonamides incorporating valproyl moieties were prepared recently.30 the valproyl derivative of acetazolamide (5-valproylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide)
val-aza was one of the best hca i and hca ii inhibitors in this series and exhibited very strong anticonvulsant properties in a maximal electroshock seizure (mes)
test in mice.30 it was also observed that some structurally related derivatives such as 5-pivaloylamido-1,3,
4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide piv-aza31 and 5-adamant-

2.2. carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity

2.3. lipophilicity

the new sulfonamides reported here were assayed for
inhibition of two ca isozymes (ca i, and ii) known to
play a critical role in electrolyte secretion/co2 transport
processes in a variety of tissues,18 using the esterase activity of these enzymes (with 4-nitrophenylacetate as chromogenic substrate). the inhibition data are shown in table

in each series of tail (a–d), the lipophilicity of the most
active compounds a6–a9, b6–b9, c6–c9, and d6–d7
was expressed as their capacity factor (log k 0 ) measured by
liquid chromatography at ph 7.40 by using an immobilized artiﬁcial cellular membrane (iam) stationary phase
(table 2).37;38 their clogp has been also calculated with
the software c hemd raw u ltra 6.0.1. (table 2).39

2.4. maximal electroshock seizures test
the anticonvulsant activity of the most active ca
inhibitors reported here was examined at 30 mg/kg (ip)
in mice by using the mes test, which detects drugs that
prevent spread of tonic-clonic seizures.40;41 three hours
following intraperitoneal administration of 30 mg/kg,
the electrical stimulus was delivered and the extent of
protected mice was noted (table 2).
3. discussion
3.1. chemistry
in a previous work30 it was showed that some sulfonamide cais incorporating lipophilic moieties, such as
the valproyl, pivaloyl, or adamantyl residues connected
to the structure of acetazolamide, exhibited good anticonvulsant activity in experimental animals. these data
prompted us to extend our investigations in this ﬁeld,
reporting a new series of sulfonamides incorporating
adamantyl moieties attached to the scaﬀolds of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides of type 1–9, known to
act as good cais.18;30
the amides a1–a9 and b1–b9 incorporating the adamantyl/adamantylmethyl moieties were obtained from
the corresponding acids, which were converted to the
acyl chlorides (with socl2 ), by reaction with aminosulfonamides 1–9 in the presence of base (triethylamine,
pyridine, or sodium bicarbonate).33;34 the amides were
obtained in good yields by this simple method. it has
been demonstrated that in such conditions only the
acylation reaction of the amino moiety takes place,
without the concomitant n-acylation of the sulfonamide
group.33;34
ureas c1–c9 and thioureas d6, d7 were analogously
obtained by reaction of aminosulfonamides 1–9 with

adamantyl isocyanate and adamantyl isothiocyanate,
respectively, as reported for other cais incorporating
these functionalities.35;36
3.2. carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity
the data of table 1 show that the new inhibitors prepared by attaching diverse adamantyl-containing moieties to aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides 1–9, are
systematically more eﬀective as compared to their parent
sulfonamide from which they were prepared, toward the
two investigated isozymes, hca i and hca ii. the
enhanced inhibitory power of these compounds is presumably due to the interaction of the relatively bulky
adamantyl moiety with the enzyme active site. the following structure–activity relationships can be evidenced
on hca: (i) the adamantylacetamides b1–b9 were more
eﬀective cais than the corresponding adamantylcarboxamides a1–a9, which were in turn more eﬀective
inhibitors than the corresponding ureas c1–c9. these
were more eﬀective cais as compared to the corresponding thioureas d6, d7. thus, the best tail for
inducing good ca inhibitory properties was the adamantylacetamide one of type b; (ii) heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating heads 8 and 9 were more
eﬀective cais as compared to the aromatic derivatives
incorporating heads 1–7. among these last derivatives,
the scaﬀolds of halogenated sulfanilamides 2–5 and
4-aminoethyl-benzenesulfonamide 7 generally lead
to better inhibitors than the simple sulfanilamide scaffold 1; (iii) among the halogenated sulfonamides, the
bromo 4 and the iodo 5 compounds are more active; (iv)
ca ii was much more sensitive to inhibition by these
sulfonamides as compared to isozyme ca i, a fact well
documented for many types of sulfonamide inhibitors.18
it should also be mentioned that some of the new sulfonamides reported here, such as a8, a9, b8, b9, c8,
and c9 possess ca i and ca ii inhibitory properties of
similar or better potency than the clinically used

m. a. ilies et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 12 (2004) 2717–2726

inhibitors acetazolamide aza and  xxxd2592xxx 
mza, being slightly less eﬀective than topiramate tpm.
due to the low expression of ca i and to the abundance
of ca ii in the brain, the selectivity toward ca ii isozyme should be favorable to the anticonvulsant activity.
the ratio of the ki values (hca i/hca ii) of a8
(ratio¼85) is higher than that of acetazolamide
(ratio¼75), the most speciﬁc hca i inhibitor, whereas
a9 (ratio¼64) and c9 (ratio¼57) were more selective
for hca ii than topiramate (ratio¼50).
3.3. lipophilicity
generally, the crossing of the blood-brain barrier is
related to lipophilicity, this parameter has been determined for the best ca ii inhibitors (a6–a9, b6–b9, c6–
c9, and d6, d7), as well as for the reference ca
inhibitors (tpm, aza, mza). on one hand, their
lipophilicity was theoretically calculated and expressed
as clogp; on the other hand, their lipophilicity was
experimentally determined by using iam columns and
expressed as their capacity factor (log k 0 iam) (table
2).38 these iam columns are coated with a monolayer
of phosphatidylcholine immobilized on a silica support
and mimic very closely the lipid environment of a ﬂuid
cell membrane. it has been demonstrated that the log k 0
iam value represents the so called ‘phospholipophilicity’. this value is better than the octanol–water partition
coeﬃcient (log p ) or than d log p to predict the bloodbrain barrier crossing. indeed, iam chromatography
takes into account hydrophobic, ion pairing, and
hydrogen bonding interactions. considering the adamantyl side chain, the thioureas compounds (d6, d7)
were more lipophilic than their ureas counterparts (c6,
c7) whatever the method used. as expected, the log k 0
iam and the clogp of adamantylacetamides b6–b9
were higher than that of adamantylcarboxamides a6–
a9 (d log k 0 iam ¼ þ0:1 to þ0.7; dclogp ¼ þ0:4 to
0.9). by using the chromatographic method, the phospholipophilicity of both types of benzenesulfonamide
moieties is quite similar (compare a6–a7, b6–b7, c6–
c7, and d6–d7). on the contrary, the clogp of aminoethyl-benzenesulfonamides 7 are higher than that of the
aminomethylbenzenesulfonamides 6 (dclogp ¼ þ0:1 to
þ0.5). similarly, the clogp value of the 4-methylthiadiazoline derivatives (a9, b9, c9) is higher that that of
their thiadiazole counterparts (a8, b8, c8; dclogp ¼
þ0:1 to þ0.5). taking all these results, a poor correlation (p < 0:05) is observed between log k 0 iam and
clogp values. the clogp value of all the adamantyl derivatives investigated are much higher
(clogp > þ1:53) than that of  xxxd2592xxx  mza
(clogp ¼ þ0:09) or topiramate (clogp ¼ þ0:04) marketed as anticonvulsant. thus both sets of values are
features of compounds able to cross the blood-brain
barrier well,37 as was the case of the reference ca
inhibitors tpm, aza, or mza. it should be mentioned
that at the physiological ph, due to the acidity of the
sulfonamide/sulfamate moieties, all these drugs are
found as sulfonamidate/sulfamate anions. still, as the
anion is in equilibrium with the free acid (sulfonamide/
sulfamate) that is able to cross membranes, a lipophilic

2721

enough such molecule would not have diﬃculties in
crossing the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain
cas, which represent the target of these cais. thus, the
lipophilicity measurements/calculations are really critical for detecting good anticonvulsant candidates among
the compounds synthesized in this work.
3.4. maximal electroshock seizures test
compounds characterized by a high ca ii inhibitory
potency and by a lipophilicity propitious to brain penetration were evaluated for their anticonvulsant properties in the mes-test. intraperitoneally administered in
mice at 30 mg kg1 , their anticonvulsant activity was
evaluated 3 h later and deﬁned as a protective index
against convulsions induced by an electrical stimulus.
with a protective index ranging from 42% to 58%,
compounds a7, b9, c8, and d7 can be regarded as poor
anticonvulsant drugs as well as the aminomethylbenzenesulfonamides (a6, b6, c6, d6). the molecules b7,
b8, c7, and c9 can be considered as moderately active
(protective index: 67–75%).  xxxd2592xxx  mza and
both adamantylcarboxamido derivatives a8 and a9
exhibited a high protection against induced convulsions (>90%). dose–response curves (30, 20, 10, 5,
2.5 mg kg1 ) were performed with these two last compounds. the ed50 of 4-methylthiadiazolidine a9 and
thiadiazole a8 were 2.6 and 3.5 mg kg1 , respectively.
both molecules were the most selective inhibitors of the
series for hca ii mainly located in the brain.
in conclusion this work led to the design, the synthesis
and the discovery of two lipophilic anticonvulsant
compounds characterized by a high inhibitory potency
of hca ii and a selectivity for this isozyme when compared to their activity on hca i. further in vivo
experiment (time-course activity, other epileptic models)
are warranted to conﬁrm their interest in the treatment
of central nervous disease such as epilepsy, or depression
among others.

aminosulfonamide was suspended/dissolved in 20 ml
anhydrous mecn and 0.78 ml (0.56 g, 5.5 mmol) triethylamine was added under stirring. the mixture was
cooled to 0–5 c, then a solution of 5 mmol adamantanecarboxyl chloride/adamantaneacetyl chloride (generated from the corresponding acids and thionyl
chloride), dissolved in 3 ml mecn, was added dropwise
during 15 min. the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 h or until a reasonable conversion was
reached (tlc control). the solvent was evaporated in
vacuum and the resulted product was treated with
20 ml water. the crude product was ﬁltered oﬀ, washed
with water, and dried. yields were in the range of 50–
90%, depending on the reactivity of the corresponding
aminosulfonamide. the resulted compounds were further puriﬁed by recrystallization (from ethanol) or by
column chromatography, when the fractions containing
the desired compound were collected, evaporated to
dryness, and the obtained product was recrystallized
from the same solvent.
4.2.2. general procedure for the synthesis of adamantyl
ureas c1–c9 and thioureas d6, d7. aminosulfonamide
(5 mmol) dissolved in 15 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofurane, were treated under stirring with 5 mmol adamantyl
isocyanate/isothiocyanate dissolved in 3 ml thf. the
mixture was reﬂuxed overnight or until a reasonable
conversion was reached (tlc control). then the solvent
was evaporated in vacuum and the resulted crude
product puriﬁed by recrystallization from ethanol or by
column chromatography followed by recrystallization

from the same solvent. yields were in the range of 30–
90%, depending on the reactivity of the corresponding
aminosulfonamide. moreover, due to the low reactivity
of adamantyl isothiocyanate and its limited thermal
stability, the corresponding thioureas could be obtained
just in the case of very reactive aminosulfonamides.

4.3. enzyme preparations
human ca i and ca ii cdnas were expressed in
escherichia coli strain bl21 (de3) from the plasmids
paca/hca i and paca/hca ii described by lindskog
et al.47 cell growth conditions were those described by
this group,48 and enzymes were puriﬁed by aﬃnity
chromatography according to the method of khalifah
et al.49 enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, utilizing a molar absorptivity
of 49 mm1 cm1 for ca i and 54 mm1 cm1 for ca ii,
respectively, based on mr ¼ 28:85 kda for ca i, and
29.30 kda for ca ii, respectively.50;51

initial rates of 4-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis catalyzed by diﬀerent ca isozymes were monitored spectrophotometrically, at 400 nm, with a cary 3 instrument
interfaced with an ibm compatible pc.52 solutions of
substrate were prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile; the
substrate concentrations varied between 2 · 102 and
1 · 106 m, working at 25 c. a molar absorption
coeﬃcient e of 18,400 m1 cm1 was used for the 4-nitrophenolate formed by hydrolysis, in the conditions of
the experiments (ph 7.40), as reported in the literature.52
nonenzymatic hydrolysis rates were always subtracted
from the observed rates. triplicate experiments were
done for each inhibitor concentration, and the values
reported throughout the paper are the mean of such
results. stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mm) were prepared in distilled–deionized water with 10–20% (v/v)
dmso (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations)
and dilutions up to 0.01 nm were done thereafter with
distilled–deionized water. inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at room
temperature prior to assay, in order to allow for the
formation of the e–i complex. the inhibition constant
ki was determined as described by pocker and stone.52
enzyme concentrations were 3.3 nm for hca ii, and
9 nm for hca i.
4.4. lipophilicity
the retention factor was determined with a immobilized
artiﬁcial membrane (iam) column (1 cm, £ ¼ 3 mm,
regis technologies, morton grove, il, usa) connected to a hplc system (hp 1100 series, agilent
technologies) equipped with a diode-array detector.
the mobile phase was 0.01 m pbs (ph 7.4) at a ﬂow of
0.7 ml/min. the column was maintained at 37 c and
the drugs detected at 254 nm. the retention factor (log k 0
iam) is expressed as (tr  t0 þ=t0 were tr is the retention
time of the drug and t0 the void time.37;38 drugs (104 m)
were dissolved in the mobile phase containing 1%
dmso as void marker. values are means of three
injections, the standard deviation is less than 1%. for
each drug, the clogp value was calculated by using the
program c hemd raw u ltra 6.0.1.39
4.5. maximal electroshock seizures test
each compound was intraperitoneally injected to of1
male mice (26–29 g; iﬀa-credo, brusseles, belgium) at a
dose volume of 3 ml/kg. three hours later, an electrical
stimulus (50 ma; 60 hz) was delivered for 0.2 s through
corneal electrodes. protection against seizures was
deﬁned as the abolition of the hind limb tonic extension
and results expressed as the percentage of animals who
did not convulse.40;41 the preliminary screening was
conducted with groups of 8–12 mice at an intraperitoneal dose of 30 mg/kg. for compounds a8 and a9,
dose–response were performed at a dosage of: 20, 10, 5
and 2.5 mg/kg. nonlinear regression (g raphp ad prism
software 3.0) was used to determine the intraperitoneal
dose (ed50) protecting 50% of mice against electrically
induced convulsions.
