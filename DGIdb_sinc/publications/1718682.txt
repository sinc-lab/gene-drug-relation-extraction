summary
synopsis

 xxxd2155xxx , a long-acting liz-selective adrenoceptor agonist, produces dose-proportional bronchodilation in patients with obstructive airways disease with a reversible component. a significant
effect occurs within minutes of inhalation of a therapeutic  xxxd2155xxx  dose and persists for approximately 12 hours. oralformoterol has a slower onset ofaction 'than the inhaled formulations,
but also produces prolonged bronchodilatory effects.
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  has shown a therapeutic efficacy equivalent to or better than comparable
dosages of the conventional 1i2-agonists salbutamol,  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline in short and long
term trials, in both adults and children with asthma. its prolonged duration of action permits a
twice-daily dosage regimen and results in improved control of nocturnal symptoms by reducing
the 'morning dip'.  xxxd2155xxx  also compares well with oral slow release theophylline. in addition,
significantly more patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (coad) had an improvement
in symptoms when treated withformoterol compared with salbutamol orfenoterol. noncomparative
studies indicate  xxxd2155xxx  also provides effective prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma. development of tachyphylaxis has not been observed.
 xxxd2155xxx  is generally well tolerated. adverse effects observed representpredictable extensions
of its pharmacology. tremor and palpitations are most frequently reported. the incidence of adverseevents is dose-proportional and therefore related to the route of administration, being more
frequent following oral than inhalation therapy.
the long-acting ii:z-agonists, including  xxxd2155xxx , represent a significant advance over current
maintenance or prophylactic bronchodilator therapy with intermediate-acting 1i2-agonists such as
salbutamol,  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline, predominantly because of the twice daily administration
regimen. however, comparisons with other long-acting 1i2-agonists, such as salmeterol, evaluation
of its role in improving symptom control in patients failing to respond to prophylactic therapy,
and clarification of the optimal role ofii:z-agonists in asthma maintenance therapy are required
to fully determine the value offormoterol in the management of obstructive airways disease.
pharmacodynamic properties
 xxxd2155xxx  is a long-acting selective ~2-adre noce ptor agoni st which has dem onstrated significant bronchodilato ry effects. in patients with asthma inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  produ ced rapid , do seproportional bronchodilation with increases in forced expiratory volume in i second (fev i),
forced vital capacity (fvc), peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) and specific airwa ys conductance
(sgaw). effective doses of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  significantl y decreased specific airwa ys resistance
within minutes. max imum bronchodilation was achieved with in 2 hours, with effects persisting
for approximately 12 hours, significantly longer than the bronchodilatory effects of equivalent
doses of salbutamol,  xxxd2098xxx  or terbutaline. oral  xxxd2155xxx  had a slower onset of action th an
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  but also produced prolonged effects.  xxxd2155xxx  also demonstrated significant
antiallergic activit y in an imals and in health y volunteers, and in inhaled form had a prot ective
effect in pro vocat ion tests in asthmatic patients.
 xxxd2155xxx  produced a dose-proportional increas e in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure in health y volunteers and patien ts with asthma, but these changes were sma ll and with in
physiological norms at therapeuti c dosages.

pharmacokinetic properties
following therap eutic do ses  xxxd2155xxx  concentratio ns in body tissues and fluids are ofte n
below th e detection lim its of currently available assays. an elimination half-life of 1.7 to 2.3
hours after  xxxd2155xxx  inhal ation has been calculated in hum an s. after oral form otero l 40llg or
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  241lg, 9.6% and 24%, respectively, of the do se was recovered from the urin e
over 24 hour s and a glucuronic acid conjugate was identifi ed. it is possible  xxxd2155xxx  has a
prolonged elimi nation half-life which has not yet been detected in hum an s.

therapeutic use
the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled or oral  xxxd2155xxx  was demonstrated in several short term
and a few long term studies of adults with asthma or chronic obstructive airways diseases (coad)
and children with asthma or non-asthmatic respiratory disorders. noncomparative studies in
patients with chronic bronchial asthma showed  xxxd2155xxx  improved subjective clinical symptoms and lung function parameters . no evidence of tachyphylaxis was found in trials lasting up
to 252 weeks, during which 70 to 100%of asthmatic adults showed some improvement. reduction
in the severity of clinical symptoms , and a significant increase in fey i, resulted in decreased
usage of 'rescue' medication .
symptoms diminished in 64 to 100%of children receiving oral  xxxd2155xxx  and in 79 to 87%
when  xxxd2155xxx  was administered by inhalation . fey 1 and airways resistance also improved
during a 2-week study, and the mean frequency of nocturnal and diurnal asthma attacks decreased.
overall efficacy offormoterol was at least equivalent to and in some trials significantly greater
than, an equipotent dose of salbutamol , and diurnal variation in pre-bronchodilator pefr was
significantly less pronounced in patients taking  xxxd2155xxx  (i2ijg twice daily) compared with salbutamol (2001jg 4 times daily) [17 vs 42 l/min] . patients receiving  xxxd2155xxx  experienced fewer
asthma attacks and required less rescue medication than those taking salbutamoi. there was an
overall patient preference for formoteroi. in patients with nocturnal asthma, a single night-time
dose of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12ijg was more effective than salbutamol 200ljg.
 xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd2098xxx  produced similar improvements in pulmonary function, but  xxxd2155xxx  significantly reduced the number of nocturnal asthma attacks from baseline by the third
week of treatment whereas  xxxd2098xxx  did not.  xxxd2155xxx  was at least as effective as terbutaline
and provided better control of symptoms of nocturnal asthma .  xxxd2155xxx  showed a similar
duration of action to slow release theophylline in patients with nocturnal asthma , and demonstrated superior tolerability, although sleep disturbance caused by asthma was more frequent in
patients taking formoteroi. combined  xxxd2098xxx  plus ipratropium bromide induced bronchodilation to a similar extent as  xxxd2155xxx  monotherapy and both agents were well tolerated. however, from 4 to 12 hours after administration,  xxxd2155xxx  produced a significantly better effect.
the few published studies assessing prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma (eia) have indicated that inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24ijg gives complete protection even when administered up to 8
hours before 5 to 8 minutes of strenuous exercise. both inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24ijg and  xxxd2098xxx 
400ijg prevented eia when administered 15 minutes before 6 minutes of exercise. similarly,
 xxxd2155xxx  12ijg and salbutamol 200ijg prevented eia when given 2 hours before 5 to 8 minutes
of exercise. however, when administered 4 hours prior to exercise,  xxxd2155xxx  provided a protective efficacy significantly greater than that of salbutamo i.
a number of small noncomparative japanese trials have shown oral  xxxd2155xxx  to reduce
symptom severity in 75 to 100%of children with non-asthmatic respiratory disorders. symptoms
disappeared within 1 week of starting therapy in all patients adm inistered  xxxd2155xxx  syrup 3 to
4 ijgjkg/day. a large study of adults with coad demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in 90% of
patients, and 83% preferred  xxxd2155xxx  to prior therapy. significantly more patients with coad
experienced improvement whilst treated with  xxxd2155xxx  compared to  xxxd2098xxx  or salbutamol in
2 large parallel studies. fey 1 increased significantly in  xxxd2155xxx  recipients during the 2- and
4-week trials but not in patients receiving  xxxd2098xxx  or salbutamoi. further well designed, long
term studies in large numbers of patients are required to confirm the above results.

tolerability
 xxxd2155xxx  is tolerated well in adults and children, the adverse effects experienced being those
seen with other {32-agonists. the most frequently reported effects were tremor and palpitation
which occurred in 10.7%and 11.5%of asthmatic adults receiving oral  xxxd2155xxx  20 to 40ijg once
to 4 times daily. inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12ijg twice daily was associated with tremor in 6.4% and
palpitation in 0.4% of 236 patients. tachycardia occurred in 1.6%of patients receiving oral  xxxd2155xxx , however in 1 trial with oral  xxxd2155xxx  the incidence was 15%(3/20 patients). this was

drugs 42 (1) 1991

118

resolved when the oral dosage was reduced from 120 to 60 f.tg/day. headache, cough, dizziness,
dry mouth and nausea were occasionally reported.
.
overall, the range and incidence of adverse effects observed with  xxxd2155xxx  did not appear
to be significantly different from that of other ih-agonists. however, it must be emphasised that
only limited numbers of pat ients have been involved in comparative studies to date . as with
other 132-agonists, high doses of  xxxd2155xxx  may cause marked hypokalaemia.

dosage and administration
inhaled formoterol12 or 24j1g (i or 2 puffs) twice daily should be used as maintenance therapy .
it has recently been recommended that long-acting 132-agonists be reserved for use in asthma
patients with symptoms inadequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. the manufacturer
also recommends that inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  may be used as rescue medication, and for prophylaxis
against exercise- or allergen-induced bronchoconstriction. no more than 2 puffs in 6 hours should
be taken. the maximum recommended daily dose is 6 puffs (72f.tg). tablet and dry syrup form ulations are available in some countries. recommended dosage of  xxxd2155xxx  tablets is 80f.tg 2
or 3 times daily in adults and 1.5 jig/kg 2 or 3 times daily in children. in children,  xxxd2155xxx  4
jig/kg/day in 2 or 3 doses , orally as a dry syrup, has also provided effective control of symptoms.
alternative or additional therapy is required if reduced efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  is noted, as this
generally indicates worsening of asthma.

1. pharmacodynamic properties

1.1 effects on pulmonary function

 xxxd2155xxx  is a long-acting selective ih-adrenoceptor agonist formulated as the fumarate . it has
a unique chemical structure with an acylamino
group substituted on the benzene ring (fig. 1). in
common with other selective 132-agonists [salbu-

in vitro,  xxxd2155xxx  produced dose-proportional
relaxation of guinea-pig lung parenchyma and trachea, and was more potent than other l3-adrenoceptor agonists tested, including  xxxd2098xxx , salbutamol, terbutaline and salmeterol (ida 1976b, 1981;

tarnol (albuterol),  xxxd2098xxx , etc.], forrnoterol has

 xxxd2155xxx : a review

 xxxd2155xxx  (1.7 minutes) , but there was a delay of
17.6 minutes before the effects of salmeterol were
observed (jeppsson et al. 1989). studies in volunteers found that oral  xxxd2155xxx  20/lg or more produced a dose-proportional decrease in respiratory
resistance after 30 minutes (seki & miyazaki 1983),
and inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24/lg had a rapid onset of
action; the improvements in lung function parameters related to obstruction were more pronounced in smokers than in nonsmokers, and the
duration of action was more than ii hours (kronenberger et al. 1989, 1990; kullmer et al. 1990).
assessment of effective airway diameters indicated
that the response to  xxxd2155xxx  was greatest in the
central airways and gradually decreased towards the
lung periphery (kronenberger et al. 1989).

1.1.1 studies in patients with asthma
the effects of oral  xxxd2155xxx  on pulmonary
function in patients with asthma were dose-proportional within the range of 20 to 360/lg (kawakami et al. 1983b; lofdahl & svedmyr 1989; nakajima et al. 1983c), and compared with a standard
oral dose of salbutamol (4mg),  xxxd2155xxx  80/lg had
a similar onset of action , with maximum bronchodilation occurring about 4 hours after administration . however, the duration of  xxxd2155xxx  activity
was usually significantly prolonged compared with
that of salbutamol (table i).
administration of ih-agonists by inhalation is
generally favoured over oral therapy in patients
with asthma. inhalation delivers the drug directly
to the target site of action, the bronchotracheal tree,
producing a relatively rapid onset of action , a reduction in the dosage required for clinical effect
and decreased systemic exposure compared with
other administration routes (reviewed in kesten &
rebuck 1989). thus , recent studies have predominantly evaluated the activity of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx .
dose-response studies indicate inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  produces dose-proportional bronchodilation
in patients with asthma. a significantly greater effect was observed after formote rol 12/lg compared
with 3 or 6/lg (geisler 1987), but  xxxd2155xxx  24 or
48/lg often did not produce further significant im-

119

provements (table i). inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  doses of
12 or 24/lg were most commonly used in singledose studies, usually producing a bronchodilatory
effect of similar magnitude to standard doses of
salbutamol (fig. 2) and  xxxd2098xxx  (table i; maesen
et al. i990b,d).
a significant reduction in specific airways resistance (sraw) occurs within minutes of  xxxd2155xxx  inhalation (derom et al. 1989; geisler 1987;
hedenstrom & wegener 1990; von berg & berdel
1987, 1989, 1990; wettengel 1987; wonne & hofmann 1988), with the delay between drug administration and achievement of significant effects
being similar to that occurring after inhalation of
 xxxd2098xxx  or salbutamol (table i). maximum bronchodilation is achieved within 2 hours, but usually
occurs slightly later than the peak effects of  xxxd2098xxx  or salbutamol (clauzel et al. 1990; lofdahl &
svedmyr 1989; maesen et al. i990c; nolte & rolke
1987; wettengel 1987). however, only minimal
differences in the magnitude of bronchodilation
achieved from 0 to 2 hours post dose with equivalent doses of  xxxd2155xxx  and other 112-agonists are
usually observed (fig. 2; lofdahl & svedmyr 1989;
nolte & rolke 1987; von berg & berdel 1989), and
formot erol 12 or 24/lg produces a maximum effect
similar to or slightly greater than recommended
doses of salbutamol or  xxxd2098xxx  (table i).
the bronchial effects of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  persist for over 12 hours, significantly longer than those
of salbutamol (fig. 2),  xxxd2098xxx  or terbutaline (table
i). an early study found 'morning dipping' [24-hour
variation in peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) with
nadir at approximately 0400 to 0600 hours] was
significantly reduced in patients with nocturnal
paroxysmal asthma who received oral  xxxd2155xxx 
80/lg at 2000 hours the previous evening (nakajima et al. 1983a). inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12/lg at 2200
hours also maintained forced expiratory volume in
i second (fey 1) above baseline values at 0400
hours in 16 patients with nocturnal asthma, whereas
fey 1 fell below baseline at 0400 hou rs after inhaled salbutamol 200/lg at 2200 hours (maesen et
al. 1990c). a 2-week trial in 20 patients found diurnal variations in pefr were significantly less
marked in patients receiving inhaled  xxxd2155xxx

1.2 inhib ition of allergic responses
 xxxd2155xxx  inhibited both allergic and nonallergic histamine release by human basophils and
lung mast cells with a potency similar to that of
ketotifen, a histamine h ,-receptor antagonist and
mast cell stabiliser.  xxxd2098xxx  was slightly less potent than  xxxd2155xxx  ,  xxxd2398xxx  ( xxxd2401xxx )
was 10-fold less potent and salbutamol was more
than 50-fold less potent with minimal activity
(subramanian 1986). furthermore,  xxxd2155xxx  or
salbutamol i0 umol/l significantly decreased superoxide anion production by human alveolar
macrophages from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lusuardi et al. 1990).
bronchoalveolar lavage in ragweed-sensitised dogs
with chronic airway hyperresponsiveness revealed
that histamine release in response to inhaled allergen was significantly decreased by inhalation of
either  xxxd2155xxx  300~g or salbutamol 5mg, but
only  xxxd2155xxx  significantly reduced eosinophil
influx into the airways, and neither drug altered
leukotriene production (bibi et al. 1990).  xxxd2155xxx  also lessened pulmonary oedema after histamine inhalation in guinea-pigs (ida 1981).  xxxd2155xxx  demonstrated markedly greater antiallergic

potency than salbutamol in several other in vitro
models, in rat models of passive anaphylaxis and
in a guinea-pig model of histamine-induced airway
microvascular leakage (ida 1981 ; kajita et al. 1984;
mita & shida 1983; nials et al. 1990; rabe et al.
1990; tasaka 1986; tokuyama et al. 1991; tomioka et al. 1981, 1984). several investigators have
reported attenuation of  xxxd2155xxx -induced inhibition of allergic responses by ,b-blockers (rabe et
al. 1990; subramanian 1986; tasaka 1986; tomioka et al. 1981, 1984).
in healthy volunteers intradermal  xxxd2155xxx  1pg
to 100ng administered 2 minutes before ige challenge dose-proportionally inhibited the weal and
flare response and was 50-fold more potent than
terbutaline. furthermore, intradermal  xxxd2155xxx 
20ng protected against the weal and flare response
for at least 24 hours, whereas terbutaline soong
protected for only 8 hours (gronneberg & zetterstrom i990a). suppression of progressive induration (late phase reaction) was proportional to the
 xxxd2155xxx  dose and persisted for 24 hours, whereas
terbutaline provided protection for only the first 4
to 6 hours after ige challenge. both  xxxd2155xxx  and
terbutal ine inhibited the weal but not the flare response to intradermal histamine challenge, suggesting both agents reduce permeability but not vasodilation (gronneberg & zetterstrom 1990b).

salbutamol: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001 (after maesen et at. i990c).

1.2.1 studies in patients with asthma
 xxxd2155xxx  protects against allergic reactions at
least as well as, if not better than , other {:l2-agonists
in asthma provo cation tests. in sensitised adults
 xxxd2155xxx  12/lgaerosol had a significantly greater
preventative effect than terbutaline 500/lg when
administered 4 hours before dust mite allergen
provocation (ferguson et al. 1989).  xxxd2155xxx  12/lg
aerosol 4 hours before  xxxd2586xxx  challenge also
provided greater protection than salbutamol 200/lg
aerosol 2 hours , or nebulised terbuta line 250/lg 5
hours before  xxxd2586xxx  challenge (leuenberger
& gebre-michel 1988; nix et al. 1900). the duration of protection provided by  xxxd2155xxx  against
histamine challenge was similar to that offenoterol
400/lg aeroso l (magnussen 1989), but was prolonged compared with  xxxd2098xxx  200/lg (nowak et
al. 1987). the early asthmatic reaction to allergen
challenge 30 min utes after formotero l 30/lg aerosol
or salbutamol 500/lg aerosol was completely inhibited, but with allergen rechallenge 4 to 10 hours
after {:l2-agonist administration only  xxxd2155xxx  significantl y protected against the late asthmatic reaction , as measured by the reduction in pefr
(palmq vist et al. 1989).
in 16 children with asthma,  xxxd2155xxx  12 or
24/lg, and salbutamol 200/lgaerosol inhalation pro-

vided similar protection, as measured by the
methachol ine concentration required to reduce
feyi by 20% (pc20), but  xxxd2155xxx  protection was
significantly prolonged, lasting at least 12 hours,
with pc20 remaining 2-fold above baseline for over
48 hours in 4 patients after the higher formot erol
dosage. although changes in pc20 and fey i were
significantly correlated , protection from bronchoconstriction was not depende nt on bronchodilation
(becker et al. 1989). a similar study in 16 adult
asthmatic patients, comparing formotero l 12 or
21/lg with salbutamol 200/lg and placebo, confirmed that both doses of  xxxd2155xxx , but not salbutamol, were actively protective against  xxxd2586xxx -induced bronchoconstriction 12 hours after
inhalation (ramsdale et al. 1991).
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24/lg or salbutamol 200/lg
produced comparable acute bronchodilatory effects in 12 adults with asthma, but formotero l provided a greater duration of protect ion from
bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation
of cold air than did salbutamol (8 vs 3 hours , p <
0.000 1) [malo et al. 1990]. similarly, inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12/lg prevented 'fog'-induced bronchospasm for at least 6 hours in 12 susceptible asthmatic patients, whereas inhaled salbutamol 200/lg
and placebo were ineffective at this time (zanotti

 xxxd2155xxx : a review

123

et al. 1990).  xxxd2155xxx  has also demonstrated a
protective effect in exercise-induced asthma (section 3.2).
1.3 ihadrenoceptor selectivity

the effects of {32-adrenoceptor stimulation include bronchodilation and vascular smooth muscle
relaxation, whereas stimulation of {31-adrenoceptors predominantly affects cardiac function and
lipid metabol ism.  xxxd2155xxx  is a highly selective
{32-adrenoceptor agonist with a low affinity for {31adrenoceptors and minimal binding to o-adrenoceptors (decker et al. 1982; tomioka et al. 1984;
yamakido et al. 1985). in various studies in vitro
(table ii), in animal models and in healthy volunteers,  xxxd2155xxx  has generally shown a greater selectivity for {32- over {31-adrenoceptors compared
with salbutamol (decker et al. 1982; freyss-beguin
et al. 1983; ida 1976a,b, 1981 ; mita & shida 1983;
nishikori & maeno 1979),  xxxd2098xxx  (freyss-beguin et al. 1983)and terbutaline (decker et al. 1982;
gronneberg & zetterstrom 1990a).
1.3.1 cardiovascular effects
in common with other ~2-agonists  xxxd2155xxx 
has some effects on the cardiovascular system, although at doses used therapeutically these tend to
be minimal. early studies found  xxxd2155xxx  had
positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in
guinea-pig atrium cordis (ida 1981) and rat heart
cell culture (freyss-beguin et al. 1983), and pro-

duced dose-proportional increases in heart rate and
decreases in blood pressure in various animal
models (ida 1976a, 1980, 1981 ; yoshida et al. 1983).
ecg changes, including r wave depression, st
segment depression, decreased t wave amplitude
and extrasystoles, were observed in dogs (ida 1980;
yoshidaet al. 1983). the maximum rate of rise in
left ventricular pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, cardiac output, stroke volume, cardiac
work and coronary blood flow were increased,
whereas the cardiac atriovenous oxygen difference,
femoral blood flow, coronary vascular resistance
and total peripheral resistance were reduced (ida
1980,1981).
dose-related increases in heart rate and decreases in blood pressure also occurred in healthy
volunteers . heart rate peaked 2 to 3 hours after
oral  xxxd2155xxx  80llg then decreased; however, the
effects of oral  xxxd2155xxx  at the lower dose of 40llg
on heart rate were negligible. a dose-proportional
12 to 25mm hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure was observed after oral  xxxd2155xxx  20 to 300llg
(seki & miyazaki 1983; yamakido et al. 1985).
increases in heart rate in patients with asthma
receiving  xxxd2155xxx  in therapeutic doses have
tended to be small and within normal limits, reflecting the marked selectivity of  xxxd2155xxx  for {32adrenoceptors. changes in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure in these patients were also small and
within physiological norms. in crossover studies,
alterations in cardiovascular parameters after  xxxd2155xxx  have usually been similar or slightly less

than those observed after an equivalent salbutamol
dose (kawakami et al. 1983b; kono & morita 1983;
lofdahl & svedmyr 1989; maesen et al. 1990a,c;
nakajima et al. 1983a,b,c).
1.4 other effects
 xxxd2155xxx  significantly increased ciliary beat
frequency in nasal and tracheal biopsy samples from
patients with chronic bronchitis, and was slightly
more potent than salbutamol (petro et al. 1989).
inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  produced dose-proportional
decreases in serum potassium levels in patients, although these usually remained within the accepted
normal range at the doses recommended for clinical
use (maesen et al. 1990a; muller et al. 1989). in
volunteers oral  xxxd2155xxx  increased blood glucose,
lactic acid and camp plasma levels, but had little
effect on cgmp,  xxxd3055xxx  or free fatty acid levels (seki & miyazaki 1983; yamakido et al. 1985).
significant increases in camp levels have also been
detected in healthy volunteers following inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  6 to 48/lg (muller et al 1989). formo terol stimulated  xxxg67xxx  activity in vitro
(mita & shida 1983) and in canine cerebellum (nishikori & maeno 1979). respiration rate, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were potentiated
by  xxxd2155xxx  in various animal models (ida 1980).
in dogs, intravenous  xxxd2155xxx  dose-proportionaliy inhibited gastric acid secretion induced by tetragastrin but not histamine, and reduced gastric,
duodenal and ileal motility ; intraduodenal  xxxd2155xxx  reduced acid output in pylorus-ligated rats
(takeda & takagi 1980). spontaneous motility of
uteri isolated from pregnant and nonpregnant rats
was inhibited by  xxxd2155xxx , as were barium chloride- and acetylcholine- (but not epinephrine-) induced contractions of isolated guinea-pig vas deferens. oral  xxxd2155xxx  1 mg/kg or higher decreased
urinary sodium and chloride excretion, but urinary
volume, urine ph and potassium excretion were
unchanged (ida 1980).
1.5 mechanism of action
 xxxd2155xxx  acts directly on ~-adrenoceptors and
its effects are competitively inhibited by ~-adreno­
ceptor blockers (ida 1981). the mechanism of ac-

drugs 42 (1) 1991

tion of salbutamol (and other ~2-agonists) has been
recently reviewed in the journal (price & clissold
1989). briefly, ~2-agonists (including  xxxd2155xxx )
stimulate production of camp by activation of the
enzyme  xxxg67xxx  (section 1.4); camp then
triggers ~ sequence of intracellular events, ultimately producing the physiological effects associated with ~2-agonist treatment, including bronchodilation, cardiovascular, uterine and biochemical
effects. results of an in vitro study indicate that
the increased lipophilicity of the long-acting ~2­
agonists, including  xxxd2155xxx  , is associated with
binding in the smooth muscle membrane adjacent
to the ~-receptor (jeppsson et al. 1989).

2. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2155xxx  have been
described only briefly in the literature and there are
few data evaluating the properties of the drug in
humans. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(kamimura et al. 1982) and radioimmunoassay
(yokoi et al. 1983) systems, with lower detection
limits of 5 mg/l and 0.1 mg/l, respectively, have
been developed for  xxxd2155xxx  assay, with good
correlation of results achieved between these methods (yokoi et al. 1983). however, the comparatively low dosage of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  required
for therapeutic activity often produces drug concentrations in body tissues and fluids below these
limits. most available data concern oral administration of [3h] xxxd2155xxx  to animals , with little information on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx . however, oral data are pertinent as
following aerosol adm inistration of ~2-agonists by
metered dose inhaler the majority of the drug is
swallowed (walker et al. 1972).
in humans, mean peak plasma  xxxd2155xxx  concentrations of about 160 ng/l were reported following repeated oral doses of 40 to 80/lg, but values were below detection limits in some individuals,
and the frequency of drug adm inistration was not
stated (yokoi et al. 1983).
radioactivity levels in the fetus were 35% of
maternal plasma levels in pregnant rats receiving
[3h] xxxd2155xxx ; levels in milk were 39% of plasma

 xxxd2155xxx : a review

levels in lactating animals and tissue radioactivity
levels in suckling rats were less than 2% of maternal plasma levels (sasaki et al. 1983).
in humans the elimination half-life of  xxxd2155xxx  after inhalation was calculated to be 1.7 to
2.3 hours, measured by urinary excretion rate and
cumulative urinary excretion (maesen et al. 1990c).
24% of an inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24j,tg dose was excreted in the urine in the 12 hours following
administration to healthy volunteers (firkusny et
al. 1990). after oral  xxxd2155xxx  40j,tg 9.6% of the
dose was excreted in the urine over 24 hours in
humans (yokoi et al. 1983) and after oral  xxxd2155xxx  80j,tg 5.8% of the dose was recovered from the
urine as unchanged drug over 10 hours, with 8%
recovered as a glucuronic acid conjugate (tasaka
1986). considering the prolonged duration of action of  xxxd2155xxx  and the time taken to achieve
steady-state, it is possible that there is a  xxxd2155xxx 
compartment with a prolonged half-life which has
not been detected in humans as yet because of the
low plasma  xxxd2155xxx  concentrations required for
therapeutic activity.

3. therapeutic use
current treatment for bronchial asthma in adults
and children includes conventional dj-agonists such
as salbutamol,  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline, used regularly and/or 'on demand'. the former approach
(regular use) has recently come under scrutiny and
reappraisal (e.g. hargreave et al. 1990; sears et al.
1990; wong et al. 1990), particularly in the case of
 xxxd2098xxx . this is an area of contention amongst
clinicians and remains to be resolved. because of
their short duration of action these agents have to
be administered frequently, thus limiting their prophylactic usefulness in conditions such as nocturnal asthma and exercise-induced asthma. 112-agonists are also used regularly in the treatment of
reversible airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive airways diseases such as bronchitis, and in
other conditions where coughing and wheezing
predominate, particularly in children.
the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  in various formulations has been investigated in adults and children,

125

mainly in noncomparative trials. a few studies have
compared  xxxd2155xxx  with conventional 112-agonists, but not with the long-acting salmeterol. no
studies to date have addressed the possible use of
 xxxd2155xxx  in acute asthma. measures of efficacy
have included objective assessments (pulmonary
function tests usually of a spirometric type) and
subjective evaluations (difficulty in breathing, severity of asthma attacks, sleep disturbance, daily
activity, cough, wheeze, sputum volume).
3.1 bronchial asthma

3.1.1 noncomparative studies
oral and inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  were efficacious in
adults and children with bronchial asthma (table
iii), as indicated subjectively by improvement from
baseline in clinical symptoms, and objectively by
pulmonary function. no evidence of tachyphylaxis
was found, even in adult patients treated with  xxxd2155xxx  for up to 252 weeks (shima & takenaka
1983).  xxxd2155xxx  was generally well tolerated
(section 4).
 xxxd2155xxx  administered orally in dosages of 40
to 240 j,tg/day for 6 to 252 weeks improved symptoms (overall improvement/efficacy based on subjective and objective symptom scores) in 70 to
100% of adult patients (table iii). dosages of 120
jjg/day or higher tended to be more effective than
lower dosages. beneficial effects have also been
achieved with  xxxd2155xxx  administered by inhalation in adults. in 22 asthmatics administered inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24j,tg twice daily, clinical symptoms decreased rapidly, resulting in a decrease in
concurrent therapy usage, and a significant increase in fey 1 from a mean of 1.66 to 2.08l after
12 months of treatment (clauzel et al. 1990). furthermore, in a l-year study of 16 adult asthmatics
receiving  xxxd2155xxx  at the same dosage, asthma
symptoms were well controlled throughout the
study and there was no requirement for rescue
medication, although 1 patient stopped treatment
due to lack of efficacy after 9 days (rosenhall et
al. 1990).
most trials evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx 
in children have been conducted for short periods

daily. daffner (1988) demonstrated 'good' efficacy
in 87% of asthmatic children receiving inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  12~g twice daily for 2 weeks. improvements in fev 1 and airways resistance were significant on days 8 and 15 (values almost normal)
compared to day 1, and the mean frequency of
nocturnal and diurnal asthma attacks decreased
(from 1.7 to 0.7 and from 2.0 to 1.1, respectively).
improvements in airways resistance observed by
von berg and berdel (1990) were maintained during the study, and the use of additional asthma
medication was reduced in 10 of 14 children (in 6
children, 2 puffs of  xxxd2155xxx  replaced nebulised
 xxxd1763xxx , other ih -agonists and an
anticholinergic drug, while the other 4 children were
able to stop systemic theophylline).
3.1.2 comparative studies

salbutamol
several parallel or crossover studies of 4 to 52
weeks' duration have compared inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
12 or 24~g twice daily with inhaled salbutamol
400lig twice daily or 200lig 2 or 4 times daily in
patients with asthma (table iv). most trials showed
that the overall efficacy (as judged by improvement in symptoms and pulmonary function) of
 xxxd2155xxx  is equivalent to, and in some cases significantly greater than , that of an equipotent dose
of salbutamol (salbutamol 200~g is considered to
be equipotent in terms of peak effect on fev 1 to
 xxxd2155xxx  121ig) [table iv). a majority of patients
expressed a preference for  xxxd2155xxx  , despite the
similar incidence of adverse effects for both agents
(arvidsson et al. 1989; wallin et al. 1990). doseresponse tests offev i, pefr, symptom scores, and
amount of additional medication monitored
throughout two l-year studies did not show evidence of tachyphylaxis to  xxxd2155xxx  or salbutamol
(kesten et al. 1991; larsson et al. 1989; palmqvist
et al. 1990).
in general, improvements in clinical parameters
such as asthma severity, quality of night sleep and
breathlessness were significantly greater with  xxxd2155xxx  (arvidsson et al. 1989). consequently, significantly less additional medication was required

127

with  xxxd2155xxx ; for example, salbutamol and  xxxd2155xxx  recipients required an average of 4 and 2
extra puffs of salbutamol, respectively, over 24
hours (arvidsson et al. 1989; table iv). diurnal
variation in pre-bronchodilator pefr over a 12week period was significantly smaller in  xxxd2155xxx 
12iig twice-daily recipients than in the salbutamol
200lig 4 times daily group (17 vs 42 ljmin), and
morning predrug fev 1 remained significantly
higher in the  xxxd2155xxx  group (kesten et al. 1991).
stalenheim et al. (1990) demonstrated a trend towards higher mean morning fev 1 and pefr values (12% higher in the  xxxd2155xxx  group compared
with salbutamol) in patients receiving  xxxd2155xxx 
24iig twice daily, but patients in the salbutamol
group used about 4 times as much rescue medication as those in the  xxxd2155xxx  group.
in a randomised, double-blind crossover study
of 16 patients with nocturnal asthma, fev 1 values
were significantly higher after  xxxd2155xxx  12iig (inhaled at 2200 hours) than after salbutamol 2001ig,
for up to 12 hours after administration. five
patients required rescue medication after salbutamol vs 2 after  xxxd2155xxx . although  xxxd2155xxx  l zag
is adequate for prevention of nocturnal asthma in
some patients, more severe cases may require
greater than 12iig twice daily to prevent the 'morning dip' phenomenon (maesen et al. 1990d).
 xxxd2098xxx 
 xxxd2155xxx  12iig twice daily and  xxxd2098xxx  200lig
3 times daily produced a similar improvement in
pulmonary function parameters, but  xxxd2098xxx 
tended to give rise to a greater number of adverse
effects (table iv). furthermore, the number of nocturnal asthma attacks was significantly decreased
from baseline in  xxxd2155xxx  , but not  xxxd2098xxx , recipients by the third week of treatment (fig. 3; kardos & friedrich 1988). overall, inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
was judged significantly more effective than  xxxd2098xxx  (kardos & friedrich 1988; stauder & burghele 1988).

fig. 3. nocturnal asthma attack frequency in patients receiving  xxxd2155xxx  12jlg twice dailyor  xxxd2098xxx  200jlg 3 times
daily for 4 weeks (after kardos & friedrich 1988).

patients, revealed that  xxxd2155xxx  was at least as
effective as terbutaline in controlling asthma
symptoms and improving pulmonary function
(table iv). both drugs were well tolerated and
symptoms of nocturnal asthma were better controlled with  xxxd2155xxx  (tsoy et al. i990a). 'good'
overall efficacy was obtained in 66% of patients
treated with  xxxd2155xxx  and in 37% of those treated
with terbutaline (a significant difference) and
'moderate' efficacy in 25 vs 41% (chuchalin et al.
1990). furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of a
single dose of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24jlg (as assessed
by nocturnal pefr measurement) was significantly better than that of an oral dose of slow release terbutaline 7.5mg in 3 patients susceptible to
nocturnal asthma attacks receiving the drugs in
crossover fashion (fabel 1990). the twice-daily
administration regimen offormoterol was reported
to improve patient compliance (brandt & dietlein
1988).
theophylline
the present treatment options to control nocturnal symptoms of asthma include both slow release theophylline preparations and , more importantly, enhanced anti-inflammatory therapy. patients
with bronchial asthma receiving inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  24jlg twice daily demonstrated pefr values
similar to those of patients receiving a regimen of
slow release theophylline 600mg in the afternoon
plus  xxxd2155xxx  24jlg in the morning (schnabel et

al. 1988). patients receiving  xxxd2155xxx  alone experienced fewer adverse effects than those taking
theophylline plus  xxxd2155xxx , but sleep disturbance
caused by asthma was more frequent with the former treatment (6 patients had 24 attacks vs 5
patients had 10 attacks, respectively), and rescue
medication was required more often [8  xxxd2155xxx 
monotherapy patients needed 39 puffs of rescue {32agonist ( xxxd2098xxx ) vs 4 combined therapy patients
used 16 puffs]. the investigators suggested that  xxxd2155xxx  may be useful when administered prior to
slow release theophylline in treating nocturnal
asthma (schnabel et al. 1988).
combined  xxxd2098xxx  plus ipratropium
bromide
a double-blind crossover comparison of  xxxd2155xxx  24jlg and a combination of ioojlg  xxxd2098xxx  plus 40jlg ipratropium bromide in 20 asthmatic patients showed a similar degree of
bronchodilation in both treatment groups. however, from 4 to 12 hours after administration,  xxxd2155xxx  produced significantly better bronchodilation, and fewer patients discontinued therapy due
to dyspnoea (i patient, 10 hours after  xxxd2155xxx 
vs 8 patients after the combination product). both
treatments were tolerated well, but the efficacy of
 xxxd2155xxx  was rated better than that of the combined product (wylicil et al. 1990).
3.2 exercise-induced asthma
exercise-induced asthma (eia) may occur at any
age, and results of clinical studies suggest that the
majority of asthmatic patients can develop eia
after exercising vigorously in certain environmental conditions (godfrey 1984). current treatment
usually consists of prophylaxis with either an inhaled selective {32-agonist such as salbutamol, terbutaline or  xxxd2098xxx  or an inhaled nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medication such as sodium
 xxxd1763xxx  or nedocromil sodium. the mode of
action of {32-agonists in eia is as yet unclear (godfrey 1984).
the effect of single doses of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx 
6, 12 and 24jlg, administered 2 to 8 hours prior to

drugs 42 (lj /9 9/

130

exercise challenge, was assessed in 12 asthmatic
children.  xxxd2155xxx  24ttg protected completel y
against eia at 2 hours and gave almost complete
protection at 8 hours after dosing, as indicated by
sr aw measurements (a 20% increase from nominal
values). lower doses were slightly less effective at
2 hours (sraw increased by 25 to 40%) and 8 hours
(sr aw increased by 45 to 50%) [von berg & berdel
1990].
there are few published studies comparing the
efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  with that of other bronchodilators in eia. in a crossover study, 12 young
asthma patients (aged ii to 21 years) were given
formotero124ttg or  xxxd2098xxx  400ttg 15 minutes before 6 minutes of strenuous exercise. both drugs
reduced eia significantly, with 7 of 12 patients
benefiting from both agents. the mean percentage
decrease in fey 1 from baseline following exercise
was less than 10% for patients receiving either
treatment, compared with a maximal decrease in
fey 1 of 40% in patients who underwent a similar
exercise session without medicat ion (debelic &
wessollek 1988).
eia did not occur in 12 adults administered inhaled forrnoterol lzug or salbutamol zutlsg 2 hours
before 5 to 8 minutes of treadmill exercise. the
mean maximum reduction in fey i after exercise
in the active treatment groups ( xxxd2155xxx  , 7.7%;
salbutamol 14.1%) was significantly less than that
with placebo (32.7%) [mcalpine & thomson 1990].
similar results were observed in a study of 104
adults receiving  xxxd2155xxx  12ttg, salbutamol ioottg,
or placebo 2 hours prior to exercise (tsoy et al.
1990b). however , when the drugs were administered 4 hours before exercise, the mean maximal
decrease in fey i with  xxxd2155xxx  (6.7%) was significantly less than that with salbutamol (21.2%)
and placebo (22.3%) [fig. 4]. this suggests that the
protective effect of  xxxd2155xxx  persists for longer
than that of salbutamol. a similar stud y comparing
the same doses of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol 90 minutes prior to a 6-minute treadmill test
also demonstrated the protecti ve efficacy of both
drugs against eia, although  xxxd2155xxx  was most
effective (webster & piit 1990).

3.3 chronic obstructive airways disease
spasm of bronchial smooth muscle, the major
mechanical problem in bronchial asthma , is also
important in some patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (coad).  xxxd2155xxx , like other
fh -agonists, would therefore be expected to relieve
symptoms in this condition (nagano et a!' 1984).

3.3.1 noncomparative studies
symptoms of coad were defined by frequency
of coughing, wheezing and production of phlegm.
in small trials of 4 to 8 weeks' duration, about 65%
of adult patients experienced an improvement in
symptoms with formotero i (kawai & mitsui 1983;
ohta & goto 1982). more importantly, in a large
study of 242 adults with coad receiving inhaled
 xxxd2155xxx  12ttg twice daily for 12 months, 'good'
or 'very good' therapeutic efficacy (as assessed by
improvement in lung function , reduction in concomitant medication, reduction in symptom severity, improvement in subjective well-being and
preference over prior bronchodilator medications)
was demonstrated in 90% of patients . fey 1 values
improved from 1.90l at baseline to 2.54l after 12
months of treatment, and 83% of patients preferred
 xxxd2155xxx  to prior therapy . during the treatment
period there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis
(schultze-werninghaus 1990).

 xxxd2155xxx : a review

3.3.2 comparative studies
in a parallel study in patients with coad, the
mean increase in fev 1 for the 55 patients receiving oral  xxxd2155xxx  80llg twice daily was significantly higher than for the 54 patients receiving salbutamol 4mg 3 times daily after 4 weeks of
treatment. however, after 2 and 4 weeks of therapy,
mean increases in forced vital capacity (fvc) for
the salbutamol and  xxxd2155xxx  groups were approximately equal. physicians considered significantly more  xxxd2155xxx  patients than salbutamol
patients to be 'improved' or 'markedly improved'
(41 vs 28%), but in the patients' self-evaluation there
was no significant difference between the drugs
(nagano et al. 1984).
in a 2-week parallel comparison between inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  l zag twice daily (69 patients) and
inhaled  xxxd2098xxx  200llg 3 times daily (72 patients),
mean fev i measured 30 minutes after administration of  xxxd2155xxx  was significantly higher on
day 15 than on day 1 (2.4 vs 2.2l). in contrast,
fev i for patients receiving  xxxd2098xxx  did not differ
significantly on days 1 and 15. furthermore, significantly more patients found  xxxd2155xxx  effective
than  xxxd2098xxx  (62% vs 35%) [wettengel 1989].
these findings suggest a superior effect for  xxxd2155xxx  versus the comparator drugs, but require
substantiation in further studies.
3.4 children with non-asthmatic
respiratory disorders
conditions such as bronchitis, pneumonia and
whooping cough in children have major symptoms
of coughing, wheezing and production of phlegm.
these symptoms were improved in about 75 to
100% of children treated orally with  xxxd2155xxx  1
to 6.4 ilg/kg/day as a tablet or dry syrup for up to
2 weeks in a number of small japanese trials (table
v). coughing and wheezing disappeared within 1
week in all 11 patients (aged 0.4 to 5.8 years) studied by ichimura et al. (1983) who received syrup
3 to 4 ilg/kg/day, compared with 60% of 21 children (aged 0.7 to 5.0 years) receiving 2 ilg/kg/day.
no adverse effects were attributable to the drug in
either group (ichimura et al. 1983).

131

4. tolerability
inhaled, tablet and syrup formulations of  xxxd2155xxx  are well tolerated in all age groups. however, the incidence of adverse effects is difficult to
ascertain because of the variability in reporting
among studies . in studies evaluating the oral formulation, many japanese investigators reported no
adverse effects in either children or adults (e.g. kito
et al. 1983; suetsugu 1983; uchida 1982), while in
other trials the rates were 4 to 15% and as high as
22% in a group of 27 asthmatic adults receiving
oral  xxxd2155xxx  20llg twice daily for 6 weeks (kawakami 1983a; table iii). the most frequently reported adverse effects were tremor and palpitation.
in 1 noncomparative study (n = 122), tremor occurred in 10.7% and palpitation in 11.5% of asthmatic adults receiving 20 to 40llg orally once to 4
times daily (kawakami et al. 1983a). in 3 single
dose studies including more than 250 patients,
tremor and palpitation occurred in up to 20 and
23%, respectively, of adult asthmatics after administration of  xxxd2155xxx  30 to 80llg orally (kawakami 1984; kawakami et al. 1983b; nakajima et
al. 1983c).
tachycardia occurred in 1.6% of 122 patients
receiving oral  xxxd2155xxx  (kawakami et al. 1983a).
however, in 1 study the incidence was 15% (3/20
patients) ; this effect disappeared with dosage reduction from 120 to 60 jig/day(ohta & goto 1982)
and indicates therefore that 120 jig/day may be excessive in some patents. cough, dizziness, dry
mouth and nausea were occasionally reported . one
patient developed exanthema, which resolved after
dosage reduction from 120 to 60llg (kawai & mitsui 1983), and another experienced ventricular
extrasystole whilst taking oral  xxxd2155xxx  80llgtwice
daily, a dose which was considered possibly excessive (nagano et al. 1984).
children tolerated  xxxd2155xxx  well, especially the
syrup formulation (funabashi et al. 1983; honma
et al. 1983; ichimura et al. 1983; itoh et al. 1982;
kito et al. 1983; seyama et al. 1982; shioda et al.

peared when treatment was stopped (kimura et al.
1981).
adverse effects after inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  were
qualitatively comparable to those observed with
oral  xxxd2155xxx , but occurred less frequently,
thereby ensuring an improved risk/benefit ratio.
 xxxd2155xxx  12j.tg twice daily by inhalation was associated with tremor in 6.4% of 236 patients with
coad, headache in 2.5% of patients, and palpitation in 0.4% (1 patient) [schultze-werninghaus
1990]. significant changes in laboratory values,
ecg or heart rate were rarely reported.
in studies of  xxxd2155xxx  versus salbutamol,  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline, patient numbers were too
small to make detailed comparisons of the incidence and severity of adverse effects. however,
overall, the range and incidence of effects observed
with  xxxd2155xxx  did not appear to be significantly
different from that of other /12-agonists.

5. dosage and administration
 xxxd2155xxx  l2j.tg (i puff) by inhalation twice
daily should provide effective management of mild
to moderate asthma and other forms of obstructive
airways disease with a reversible component. in
patients with more severe disease a dosage of 24j.tg
twice daily may be used, with dose titration according to effect. the manufacturer also recommends that inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  may be used as rescue medication, and for prophylaxis against
allergen-induced and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. to discourage overuse of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx , treatment should be reassessedin the event
of worsening asthma and, in line withcurrent recommendations (british thoracic society 1990a,b;
reeds 1990), no more than 24j.tg inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  should be taken in any 6-hour period and a
total daily dose of 72j.tg should not be exceeded.
furthermore, it has recently been recommended

 xxxd2155xxx : a review

that long-acting fh-agonists be used only in patients
already receiving inhaled corticosteroids in whom
symptom control is inadequate (rees 1991).
 xxxd2155xxx  is available as a tablet or dry syrup
formulation in some countries. tablets are recommended at a dosage of 80/lg 2 or 3 times daily
in adults (kawakami & takenaka 1983) and 1.5
/lg/kg 2 or 3 times daily in children (kimura et al.
1981). dry syrup may be used for children at a
dosage of 4 /lg/kg/day administered in 2 or 3 divided doses (data on file, yamanouchi).
there are no current dosage recommendations
for the use of  xxxd2155xxx  parenterally or via nebuliser as these formulations do not appear to have
been fully evaluated.
 xxxd2155xxx  is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to sympathomimetic drugs, in hyperthyroid patients, and in patients with cardiac arrhythmia associated with tachycardia, idiopathic
subvalvular aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and thyrotoxicosis. it should .
be used with caution in patients with other cardiovascular disorders or diabetes. caution is also recommended in patients receiving concomitant
 xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors or tricyclic depressants. as with other {32-agonists, high doses of  xxxd2155xxx  may cause marked hypokalaemia. this
may be potentiated by other drugs used concomitantly, including theophylline, steroids and diuretics, and by hypoxia. serum potassium should
be monitored under these circumstances. hypokalaemia may also increase the susceptibility to
cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving digitalis.
furthermore, patients should be warned that reduced efficacy of  xxxd2155xxx  is generally an indication that their asthma is worsening and that alternative or additional therapy is required.

6. place of  xxxd2155xxx  in therapy
 xxxd2155xxx  is a member of a new generation of
long-acting selective ih agonists which also includes salmeterol. the long duration of action of
 xxxd2155xxx  has permitted its effective use as maintenance therapy and proph ylaxis in patients with
reversible obstructive airways disease, including

133

intrinsic and exercise-induced asthma, and coad.
 xxxd2155xxx  demonstrates significant advantages
over the conventional intermediate-acting 132-agonists such as salbutamol,  xxxd2098xxx  and terbutaline,
particularly in the prophylaxis of nocturnal asthma,
where it prevents the 'morning dip' , mostly as a
result of its prolonged duration of action. it is generally well tolerated and tachyphylaxis has not been
observed.
attention has recently focused on the role of 132agonist therapy in patients with asthma, with the
suggestion that regular inhaled medication is associated with less effective asthma control compared with intermittent treatment (editorial 1990;
sears et al. 1990; wong et al. 1990). however, these
studies predominantly evaluated treatment with
 xxxd2098xxx  and the effects observed may not be class
specific. furthermore,  xxxd2155xxx  appears to be
more selective for 132-adrenoceptors than  xxxd2098xxx .
the most appropriate way to use this long acting
agent as well as the clinical relevance of the antiallergic/anti-inflammatory properties shown in
vitro remain to be fully established. furthermore,
the role of 132-ago~ists in general as long term
maintenance therapy in asthma is currently being
reassessed. at this early stage in its development
it would seem prudent to use forrnoterol in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids to counteract
the underlying inflammatory response and minimise the risks of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
indeed such a recommendation for long-acting 132agonists as a group has recently been made (rees
1991). studies evaluating the effects of regular inhaled 132-agonist use on changes in airway responsiveness beyond the duration of the 'd irect effect'
should also help determine the role of these agents.
the role of  xxxd2155xxx  in the management of
acute asthma has not been evaluated, although its
rapid onset of action, as demonstrated in pharmacod ynamic studies, provides a rationale for its
use. the rapid onset of action of inhaled  xxxd2155xxx  confers a theoretical advantage over salmeterol in this indication, although this also requires
confirmation in clinical trials. however, conventional dj-agonists are particularly useful in this indication, with their relatively short duration of ac-

134

tion allowing rapid realisation of increased usage
which signals the need for more aggressive therap y.
longer acting ~2-ago nists would presumably not
emphasise such acute changes in treatment requirements.
in conclusion, the twice-daily administration
regimen possible with long-acting ~2-agonists such
as  xxxd2155xxx  should facilitate better control of respiratory symptoms, particularly at night, and improve patient complianc e compared with intermediate-acting drugs. however, while these agents
appear to offer real advantages in the management
of coad, their use in asthma requires further clarification. for  xxxd2155xxx , comparisons with other
long-acting ~2-agonists such as salmeterol, evaluation of its use in patients who fail to respond to,
or are intolerant of adequate doses of preventati ve
drugs and assessment of its long term effects on
morbidity/mortality in asthma patients are required to fully determine its value in the management of obstructive airways disease.
