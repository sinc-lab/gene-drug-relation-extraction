abstract
the purpose of this study was to perform a phase i trial
of  xxxd3077xxx , a selective inhibitor of  xxxg2366xxx ,
and to determine the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles
as a function of  xxxd3077xxx  dose. fifty patients with advanced solid tumors and good performance status were
treated with  xxxd3077xxx  as a 15-min i.v. infusion every 3
weeks, at doses escalating from 0.6 to 4.5 mg/m2. asthenia,
neutropenia, and hepatic toxicity were the most common
dose-limiting toxicities in this largely pretreated patient population, but they occurred during the initial cycle in only one
of nine patients treated with 4.0 mg/m2 and in two of nine
patients treated with 4.5 mg/m2. only 2 of 13 patients
treated with 3.5 mg/m2 ultimately experienced unacceptable
toxicity after three and seven cycles, compared with 42 and
56% of patients receiving 4.0 and 4.5 mg/m2 after medians
of three and two cycles, respectively. the maximum  xxxd3077xxx  plasma concentration and the area under the plasma
concentration-time curve increased in proportion to dose.
 xxxd3077xxx  clearance was independent of dose and was
associated with the estimated creatinine clearance. asthenia,
neutropenia, and hepatic transaminitis were dose-related

and tended to occur more frequently when patients received
three or more cycles of therapy. a 3-week treatment interval
was feasible in the majority of patients at all doses. although
4.0 mg/m2 appeared to be a safe starting dose in this pretreated patient population, about half who received two or
more courses ultimately experienced dose-limiting toxicity.
a dose of 3.5 mg/m2 was well tolerated in most patients.

introduction
ts2 is essential for the de novo synthesis of thymidine
nucleotides from the physiological substrate dump. ttp is an
essential precursor that is required for both dna synthesis and
repair. the pyrimidine analogues 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro29-deoxyuridine both require intracellular metabolism to
fdump (1). in the presence of sufficient concentrations of the
reduced folate cofactor, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate,
fdump forms a slowly reversible, ternary covalent complex
with ts, thus inhibiting its catalytic activity. in addition, incorporation of fluoro-utp into rna and fluoro-dutp into dna
may contribute to host toxicity as well as anticancer cytotoxicity. inhibition of ts is accompanied by accumulation of dump,
with subsequent metabolism to dutp. incorporation of dutp
into dna may also interfere with nascent dna synthesis and
integrity. in some models, expansion of dump pools can partially reverse fdump-mediated ts inhibition. these considerations stimulated interest in developing metabolic inhibitors
targeted against the folate-binding site of ts (2– 4). initial
structure-activity investigations focused on quinazoline folate
analogues of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and led to the discovery of n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid ( xxxd1260xxx ), a potent inhibitor of ts (ki, 3 nm; refs. 5–7). although clinical
responses were observed with  xxxd1260xxx , clinical development
was terminated due to severe, dose-limiting renal toxicity,
which was attributed to its poor aqueous solubility and its
precipitation in renal tubules (8 –13).
systematic efforts focused on optimizing the structure of a
molecule that would have good aqueous solubility, be transported
by the reduced folate carrier, and be a good substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase, thus allowing for prolonged intracellular
retention.  xxxd3077xxx  emerged as a leading candidate (3, 14 –18).
although  xxxd3077xxx  monoglutamate is considerably less potent
than  xxxd1260xxx  as an inhibitor of purified ts in cell-free systems (ki,
60 nm), it is a much better substrate for both the reduced folate
carrier (20-fold) and for  xxxg814xxx  (31-fold).

2382 phase i trial of  xxxd3077xxx 

furthermore, not only are the polyglutamate forms of  xxxd3077xxx 
(triglutamates and above) very potent inhibitors of ts in cell-free
systems (ki 5 1 nm), but they also have prolonged intracellular
retention. these features explain  xxxd3077xxx ’s greatly improved
cytotoxicity in cell culture models, compared with  xxxd1260xxx . a
potential mechanism of resistance to inhibitors of ts is the salvaging of thymidine from the extracellular environment and subsequent conversion to tmp by thymidine kinase. in various cell
culture models, concentrations of thymidine ranging from 1 to 20
mm protect cancer cells from the cytotoxicity of ts inhibitors
(13, 17 ). concurrent exposure to pharmacological concentrations
of  xxxd2462xxx  decreases  xxxd3077xxx  intracellular accumulation, polyglutamation, and cytotoxicity, whereas delayed administration of
 xxxd2462xxx  is less effective in rescuing cells from prior  xxxd3077xxx 
exposure (13, 17).
the circulating plasma concentrations of thymidine in humans average between 0.1 and 0.2 mm and are thought to be
insufficient to afford protection (19). in contrast, rodents have
about 10-fold higher plasma thymidine levels, which complicates the preclinical evaluation of in vivo activity of ts inhibitors, including  xxxd3077xxx  (20, 21). administration of  xxxd3077xxx 
daily for 5 days was needed to observe  xxxd3077xxx  activity in
conventional murine tumor models (14, 21–23). however, a
single dose of  xxxd3077xxx  cures murine lymphoma that is thymidine kinase-deficient.
toxicology studies in the rat and dog demonstrated that the
bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract were the most sensitive
tissues, and no deleterious effects were observed on the liver or
kidney (21, 22). the b half-life of  xxxd3077xxx  after i.p. or i.v.
bolus administration in mice and rats is 30 min, but parent drug
is detectable 24 h after dosing, suggesting a much longer terminal half-life (24). the levels of radiolabeled  xxxd3077xxx  in
l1210 ascitic leukemia cells 24 h after dosing were 50 –100-fold
higher than in plasma, with most of the drug present in polyglutamate forms (14). because a long terminal plasma half-life
and prolonged intracellular retention of  xxxd3077xxx  poluglutamates were predicted for humans as well, a single dose of
 xxxd3077xxx  given every 3 weeks was chosen for clinical trials.
the starting dose for the initial human study of  xxxd3077xxx 
performed in europe was 0.1 mg/m2, one-fifth of the lowest
toxic dose in dogs (0.5 mg/m2; ref. 25). our trial started
subsequently, and a higher starting dose of 0.6 mg/m2 was
selected based on safety information from the other trial.

patients and methods
eligibility. adult patients who were $18 years old and
had a diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent cancer for which there
was no effective therapy were eligible for this study, provided
they had an ecog ps of 0 –2, an agc of .2000/ml, a platelet
count of .100,000/ml, serum bilirubin levels of ,1.6 mg/dl, an
ast level of ,4 times the upper limits of normal, and a serum
creatinine level of ,1.6 mg/dl. patients with active infections,
pregnant or lactating females, patients with serious concurrent
medical illnesses, and patients with clinically significant third
space fluid collections were excluded. measurable or evaluable
disease was not required. while participating in this protocol,
patients were not permitted to undergo treatment with other
cancer therapies, steroids, sulfonamide antibiotics,  xxxd2146xxx , or

vitamin supplements. other therapies directed toward patient
comfort, such as analgesics or antiemetics, were allowed. this
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the
nci and the national naval medical center, and all patients
gave written informed consent.
treatment.  xxxd3077xxx  was provided by the cancer
therapy evaluation program of the nci; 10-mg vials (1 mg/ml
solution) were supplied by zeneca pharmaceuticals (wilmington, de). immediately prior to use, the drug was diluted in 150
ml of 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  injection usp, and  xxxd3077xxx  was
administered i.v. over 15 min. treatment cycles were repeated
every 21 days, provided that the toxicity from the previous cycle
had resolved. hospitalization was required for the first cycle,
but outpatient administration was an option for subsequent
cycles. the starting dose, 0.6 mg/m2, was chosen because this
was found to be safe in the ongoing european trial. a traditional
modified fibonacci scheme of dose levels was planned. as will
be described later, toxicity information from the european trial
led to a more cautious dose escalation plan in this trial.
toxicity was graded using the first version of the nci
common toxicity criteria (26). dose-limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3 nonhematological or grade 4 hematological
toxicity (agc nadir of ,500/ml or a platelet nadir of ,25,000/
ml). because transient elevation of liver function tests had been
observed with  xxxd3077xxx  in the european phase i trial without
evidence of cumulative hepatic toxicity, dose reductions were
not made for transitory elevations of ast, alt, or bilirubin,
provided that the enzyme levels returned to the patient’s baseline values when the next cycle was due to start. intrapatient
dose escalation was not permitted, but dose reductions were
allowed for reversible dose-limiting toxicities. the mtd was
considered exceeded if dose-limiting toxicity was observed in at
least one-third of the patients. patients were taken off study if
they encountered debilitating toxicity, their disease progressed,
or they asked to discontinue the protocol therapy for any reason.
patients entered in this trial experienced constitutional
symptoms characterized by fatigue, malaise, reduced performance status, fever, and, occasionally, myalgia. the grading of
this asthenic syndrome was based on the patients’ subjective
tolerance of the syndrome and whether a decline in ps occurred,
as follows: grade 1, mild symptoms that did not interfere with
the patient’s activities; grade 2, moderate symptoms that limited
some of the patient’s activities or were associated with a decrease in performance status level to no worse than ps 2; and
grade 3, severe symptoms that markedly limited the patient’s
activities, associated with a decline in performance status to ps
3 or 4.
patient evaluation and follow-up. pertinent radiological exams were performed within 4 weeks of study entry to
serve as a baseline to permit serial evaluation of the patient’s
disease status. while on study, patients were monitored weekly
for blood counts, wbc differential, and chemistry values to
monitor liver and renal function. history and physical examinations were repeated with each return visit. tumor response
evaluations were performed every two to three courses. standard response criteria were used (27).
pharmacological methodology. pharmacokinetic sampling was planned in at least three patients per dose level. blood
samples were drawn into gray-top tubes that contained oxalate

pretreatment, at timed intervals during the  xxxd3077xxx  infusion,
and 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min
after completion of the infusion; an additional sample was
obtained the following morning. the blood samples were placed
immediately on ice and centrifuged within 30 min, and the
plasma was frozen at 270°c.  xxxd3077xxx  plasma levels were
determined at zeneca pharmaceuticals using a sensitive ria
with a lower limit of quantification of 0.77 ng/ml (25). assays
were performed in duplicate on two occasions, and the average
was calculated. during analysis of samples, assay accuracy and
precision ranged from 103 to 115% and from 12.6 to 17.6%,
respectively, for quality control samples prepared at 0.77, 2.4,
and 14.9 ng/ml in plasma. the maximum plasma concentration
(cmax) was the highest plasma value obtained during the  xxxd3077xxx  infusion. the auc from 0 to 24 h was calculated by
noncompartmental analysis with winnonlin software (scientific consulting, inc., apex, nc). ts expression in tumor tissue
specimens was determined by immunohistochemistry using ts106 monoclonal antibody, as described previously (28).
statistical and graphical analysis. graphs were prepared using sigmaplot for windows version 4.01 (spss, inc.,
chicago, il). associations between clinically relevant toxicity
(presence or absence) and dose of drug were examined using
lehmann’s nonparametric version of a kruskal-wallis test for
ordered columns (29). the hochberg procedure was used to
indicate which of the ps obtained were significant at the 0.05
level in view of the multiple comparisons performed (30). all ps
are two-sided. the strength of the linear association between
pairs of variables was determined by the pearson correlation
coefficient: r $ 0.70, strong correlation; 0.5 , r , 0.70,
moderate correlation; and r 5 0.3– 0.5, weak to moderate correlation. the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test whether
values of continuous variables differed between groups. the
percentage change in leukocytes and granulocytes was determined by the following equation: 100 3 (baseline value 2 nadir
value) 4 (baseline value). the relationship between dose and
percentage change in blood counts was analyzed using a sigmoidal maximum effect model. coefficients of determination
(r2) values of .0.50 indicate a strong fit between the model and
the data, whereas values between 0.25 and 0.50 signify a moderately strong fit.

results
patient characteristics. fifty adult patients were entered in this trial (table 1). the vast majority (96%) had either
no or only minor cancer-related symptoms (ecog performance
status of 0 –1). metastatic colorectal cancer was the most frequent diagnosis, reflecting our patient referral pattern. most
patients had received one or more prior chemotherapy regimens,
and almost half had prior radiation therapy.  xxxd3077xxx  was
administered at eight dose levels ranging from 0.6 to 4.5 mg/m2.
whereas all patients had baseline serum creatinine and total
bilirubin levels of #1.5 mg/dl, patients were eligible only if
their ast level was within 4 times the upper limits of normal.
therefore, 17 patients had elevated ast values that met the
definition for grade 1 (16 patients) and grade 2 (1 patient)
toxicity, prior to receiving  xxxd3077xxx . alt values were not part
of the eligibility requirements; six patients had on-study alt

values that fell into the definition of grade 1 (two patients) and
2 (four patients) toxicity, respectively. only 14% of patients had
 xxxg124xxx  levels below normal (,3.5 g/dl).
although patients were required to have normal granulocyte counts and platelets above 100,000/ml, a minimum for
hemoglobin was not specified. eleven females (52%) and 22
males (81%) had on-study hemoglobin values below normal
(females, ,12.0 g/dl; males, ,13.5 g/dl). three patients had
baseline hemoglobin values below 10 g/dl, which meets the
definition of grade 2 toxicity. rbc folate levels, available in 15
patients, were normal in all patients: median 5 558 ng/ml
(range, 208-1208 ng/ml).
patient cohort assignment. a total of 174 doses of
 xxxd3077xxx  was given, and the median number of cycles received
by each patient was 2.5 (range, 1–11). the number of patients
entered at the highest three doses is somewhat unusual for a
phase i trial (table 2). the decision to expand the number of
patients entered at these doses was made for several reasons.
four early deaths were observed in the european trial with
unresolved drug toxicity, including 3 of 26 patients treated at 3.0
mg/m2 and 1 of 6 patients treated at 3.5 mg/m2 (26). furthermore, 26% of 23 patients treated with 3.0 mg/m2 in the european trial had grade 3– 4 diarrhea, and 4 of 6 patients treated
with 3.5 mg/m2 experienced prohibitive malaise with a decline
in performance status. in contrast, none of the first six patients
entered at 3.5 mg/m2 in our trial experienced dose-limiting
toxicity. because our patient population consisted predomi-

two patients assigned to the 4.0 mg/m2 level who were dosed on the basis of ideal body weight received actual doses of 3.2 and 3.3 mg/m2.

nantly of colorectal cancer patients who had received prior
 xxxd2462xxx  therapy, the possibility that such  xxxd2462xxx  exposure
might afford protection against  xxxd3077xxx -mediated clinical toxicity was raised. the protocol was amended to enter only patients with no recent exposure to  xxxd2462xxx  in the preceding 12
months. in case prior  xxxd2462xxx  exposure, indeed, ameliorated
clinical toxicity, patients were entered at the lower dose of 2.8
mg/m2. in addition, more cautious increments in dose levels
above 3.5 mg/m2 were planned. the next 12 patients entered in
the trial had no recent  xxxd2462xxx  therapy, and none had experienced unacceptable toxicity during their initial two cycles of
therapy. therefore, eligibility based on recent  xxxd2462xxx  exposure was abandoned. two additional patients were entered at 4.0
mg/m2, and then dose escalation proceeded to 4.5 mg/m2.
two of the first three patients entered at the 4.0 mg/m2
dose level were obese (with actual body weights 1.5- and
1.9-fold higher than ideal). because of concerns about their
safety, these two patients were dosed on the basis of their ideal
body weight. both patients had minimal toxicity during two and
five consecutive cycles, respectively. if calculated using their
actual body surface area, the dose received was 3.2 and 3.3
mg/m2, which amounted to an 18 –21% dose reduction compared with other patients entered at 4.0 mg/m2. for the analysis
of clinical toxicity, therefore, these two patients have been
included in the cohort treated with 3.5 mg/m2.

clinical toxicity. the first patient entered in this study
at 0.6 mg/m2 developed a progressive peripheral sensory neuropathy during his second cycle of  xxxd3077xxx , which interfered
with the ability to perform routine daily activities. no metabolic
or anatomical abnormalities were evident. of note, the patient
had received two cycles of the investigational platinum analogue ormaplatin 4 months before entering this trial, which was
subsequently shown to be associated with a delayed-onset peripheral neuropathy (31, 32). no further  xxxd3077xxx  was given to
this patient. five additional patients were enrolled at 0.6 mg/m2.
because only one of these experienced only mild nausea and
mouth soreness, dose escalation continued as intended.
clinical toxicity occurring with the first cycle of  xxxd3077xxx 
is summarized in table 3. mild fatigue and malaise during the
initial cycle was reported by two patients treated with 2.1
mg/m2. dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle of therapy
was not observed until a dose level of 4.0 mg/m2, when 1 of 11
patients had a granulocyte nadir below 500/ml. two of nine
patients entered at 4.5 mg/m2 had dose-limiting toxicity during
their initial cycle: one had a granulocyte nadir below 500/ml,
and one experienced grade 3 fatigue.
because we did not define a mtd based on clinical toxicities occurring during the initial cycle of therapy, toxicities
experienced with repeated cycles of  xxxd3077xxx  were then considered. some patients who experienced reversible, dose-limit-

two patients who were assigned to 4.0 mg/m2 but dosed on their
ideal body weights are included in 3.5 mg/m2 cohort. seven patients
who experienced dose-limiting toxicity at their original dose level (4.5
mg/m2, three patients; 4.0 mg/m2, two patients; and 2.8 and 1.6 mg/m2,
one patient each) continued on study at a lower dose. two of these
patients subsequently required a second dose reduction (from 3.5 to 2.8
mg/m2 and from 2.1 to 1.6 mg/m2). the worst toxicities experienced by
these patients at the lower doses are included.

ing toxicities continued to receive  xxxd3077xxx  at reduced doses.
the worst toxicities experienced by each patient across all
cycles at each dose level are summarized in table 4. granulocytopenia of grade 3 or 4 severity occurred more often than
leukopenia and was clearly dose-related. no patient treated with
1.6 mg/m2 or lower  xxxd3077xxx  had a granulocyte nadir of
,1000/ml, compared with 18 and 32% of patients treated with
2.1–2.8 and $3.5 mg/m2, respectively. only one patient treated
at 4.0 mg/m2 had a platelet nadir that was of grade 2 severity.
because many patients were anemic when they enrolled on
study, a hemoglobin nadir of ,10 g/dl was not uncommon.
however, only one patient (at 3.5 mg/m2) developed a hemoglobin nadir below 8.0 g/dl.
symptoms collectively referred to as the asthenic syndrome were the most frequent clinical toxicity reported by
patients and also appeared to be dose-related. only 14% of
patients treated with #1.6 mg/m2 reported this syndrome,
whereas about half of the patients treated with doses of 2.1
mg/m2 or higher ultimately became symptomatic. six patients
considered these symptoms to be intolerable (grade 3); one
patient each at 4.0 and 4.5 mg/m2 requested to discontinue
protocol therapy, two patients were removed for disease pro-

fig. 1 clinical toxicity during all cycles versus  xxxd3077xxx  dose. associations between the presence or absence of clinically relevant toxicity
and dose of drug were examined using lehmann’s nonparametric version of a kruskal-wallis test for ordered columns. the hochberg
procedure was used to indicate which of the ps obtained were significant

performed. the ps are two-tailed (p2).

gression, and two continued on protocol with a dose reduction
from 4.5 to 4.0 mg/m2. transient increases in serum transaminases above the patient’s baseline occurred frequently. at the
time of study entry, 34 and 12% of the patients had elevated
ast and alt values, respectively, that met the definition for at
least grade 1 toxicity. dose reductions were avoided unless the
elevated transaminase values persisted when the next cycle was
due. thus, only one patient received a dose reduction (from 1.6
to 1.0 mg/m2) for an elevated alt value. five additional
patients who experienced transient rises in either ast or alt
values that qualified as grade 3 in severity continued on therapy
at the same dose of  xxxd3077xxx . these patients received a median
of two additional cycles of  xxxd3077xxx  at the same dose (range,
1– 8 cycles), and none experienced transaminase values worse
than grade 2 in severity. four patients had transient elevations in
bilirubin values that reached grade 3 in severity before returning
to baseline; two of these patients later developed a sustained
increase in bilirubin after one and three additional cycles, respectively, at which time hepatic disease progression was documented. prophylactic antiemetics were not used in this trial,
and about half the patients experienced nausea and vomiting. a
minority experienced diarrhea of mild to moderate severity, but
this toxicity did not appear to be more common at the highest
three doses compared with 2.1–2.8 mg/m2. other infrequent
toxicities included mucositis, rash, and anorexia.
when all cycles were considered, asthenia occurred in 83
of 174 cycles (48%). fatigue was the predominant complaint
(70%), followed by fever (34%), malaise (13%), and myalgias
(4%). the incidence of toxicities complicating each cycle are
presented in fig. 1, with the data organized into three dosage
groups (low, intermediate, and high). asthenia, granulocytopenia, and transaminitis complicated significantly more cycles at
or above 3.5 mg/m2 compared with lower doses. in contrast,
diarrhea, mucositis, and nausea did not seem to be clearly
dose-related.
the number of patients who ultimately developed doselimiting toxicity and the cycle when this occurred are presented

fig. 2 clinical toxicity during the first two or subsequent cycles of therapy. to determine whether there
was evidence for increased incidence of clinical toxicity
in patients who received repeated cycles of  xxxd3077xxx ,
we compared clinical toxicity complicating either of the
first two cycles with that complicating cycles 3 and
beyond in patients treated with all  xxxd3077xxx  doses.

in table 5. only 2 of 13 patients treated with 3.5 mg/m2
experienced unacceptable toxicity after three and seven cycles.
five of 12 patients treated with 4.0 mg/m2 experienced doselimiting toxicity after a median of three cycles. five of nine
patients who received 4.5 mg/m2 had dose-limiting toxicity after
a median of two cycles. three of these latter patients subsequently received a reduced dose of 4.0 mg/m2 for an additional
one, three, and five cycles with acceptable toxicity. overall, four
of seven patients who received at least two cycles with 4.0
mg/m2  xxxd3077xxx  (including new patients and those initially
treated with 4.5 mg/m2) eventually experienced dose-limiting
toxicity.
dose escalation within individual patients was not allowed
in this trial. to determine whether there was any evidence of
cumulative toxicity, the incidence of toxicities occurring during
the initial two cycles was compared with that observed in cycles
three and beyond (fig. 2). the proportion of cycles complicated

by grade 3– 4 granulocytopenia and grade 2–3 transaminitis and
asthenia appeared to be higher for cycle 3 and beyond.
treatment cycles were repeated at median intervals of 21
days; 84% of all cycles were given at a 3-week intervals, 10%
were given at 4-week intervals, and treatment intervals were
longer than 4 weeks in only 6% of cycles. no differences were
noted in the cycle intervals according to either dose (#2.1
versus $2.8 mg/m2) or cycle number (two or fewer versus three
or more cycles; data not shown).
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.
 xxxd3077xxx  plasma concentrations were measured in 28 patients
following either the initial dose (27 patients) or the second dose
(1 patient). in this latter patient,  xxxd3077xxx  was detected in the
pretreatment blood sample (1.6 ng/ml) obtained 20 days following the previous dose of 2.8 mg/m2. because this pretreatment
value was several orders of magnitude below this individual’s
cmax value (521 times lower), the pharmacokinetic data for this

creatinine clearance was estimated by the cockcroft and gault formula,
as follows: males, (140 2 years of age) 3 (body weight in kg) 4 (72 3
serum creatinine); females, (0.85) 3 (140 2 years of age) 3 (body
weight in kg) 4 (72 3 serum creatinine). the pearson correlation
coefficient was used to assess the strength of association between the
two variables.

auc0 –24 h of  xxxd3077xxx  was determined using all available data points
and extrapolated to 24 h with winnonlin software. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the strength of association between dose and either auc0 –24 h or clearance.

patient are included in the analysis. the median duration of
 xxxd3077xxx  infusion during these pharmacokinetic sampling periods was 15 min, as intended; however, 46% of the infusions
were longer than 15 min, and 10 of these were 20 min or longer.
the maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) were most likely
affected by differences in duration of infusion because longer
infusion durations would be expected to produce lower cmax
values. the plasma elimination of  xxxd3077xxx  was triexponential.
fifteen min postinfusion,  xxxd3077xxx  plasma levels had decreased to 49.9 6 8.3% of that measured at the end of infusion.
one, 2, and 4 h postinfusion, the plasma levels had decreased to
25.5 6 5.4%, 14.2 6 3.8%, and 6.6 6 2.3%, respectively. the
maximum plasma concentration (cmax) correlated closely with
the calculated auc0 –24 h (r 5 0.803, p 5 2.7 3 1027). strong,
positive correlations were noted between either auc0 –24 h or
the cmax and the dose of  xxxd3077xxx  (auc0 –24 h versus dose is
shown in fig. 3a). in contrast, clearance was not dose-related
(fig. 3b) and averaged 49.2 6 13.3 ml/min/m2 (mean 6 sd). a
moderately strong correlation was evident between the estimated creatinine clearance values for each patient and the patient’s  xxxd3077xxx  clearance (fig. 4). in contrast, no relationship
was evident between  xxxd3077xxx  clearance and  xxxg124xxx 
levels (data not shown).
correlation analyses between  xxxd3077xxx  dose and pharmacokinetic values and measures of hepatotoxicity (fold increase
in ast values) and actual leukocyte and granulocyte nadirs as

well as percentage decrease from baseline and asthenia were
performed. no clear relationship was evident between either
cmax or auc0 –24 h and nonhematological toxicity (data not
shown). the nadir granulocyte count tended to be lower with
increasing  xxxd3077xxx  cmax (r 5 20.437; p 5 0.026), and
increasing cmax and auc0 –24 h values tended to be associated
with greater percentage decreases in the granulocyte count (r 5
0.485 and 0.471, p 5 0.022 and 0.027, respectively). when the
percentage change in granulocyte count was analyzed using a
sigmoidal maximum effect model, the coefficients of determination (r2) were 0.382 (cmax) and 0.279 (auc0 –24 h), suggesting a moderately good fit of the data.
similar analyses with clinical toxicity cycle one were performed using  xxxd3077xxx  dose. the change in granulocyte count
provided the best pharmacodynamic relationship between dose and
hematological toxicity (fig. 5). no relationship was evident between dose and platelet toxicity (data not shown). patients who
experienced an absolute decrease in their hemoglobin values by
$1.0 g/dl during their initial cycle of therapy tended to receive
higher doses (median 3.75 versus 2.8 mg/m2; p 5 0.037). whereas
the relative increase in ast values during the first cycle showed no
relationship to  xxxd3077xxx  dose (data not shown), patients who
experienced asthenic symptoms received significantly higher doses
of  xxxd3077xxx : median 4.0 versus 2.8 mg/m2 (p 5 0.001).
clinical outcome. the median time to treatment failure
was 1.8 months (range, 0.6–8.1 months). progression of disease
was the reason for discontinuing treatment in 92% of patients. four
patients requested to stop therapy after 1, 3, 4, and 11 cycles. no
partial or complete responses were observed. thirteen patients
(26%) had stable disease that lasted for 3 months or longer. initial
cea values were available in 33 of the 38 patients with colorectal
cancer, and the median was 136.6 ng/ml (range, 1.3–6928 ng/ml).
three of the 31 colorectal cancer patients (9.7%) with an initially
elevated cea level of .5 ng/ml experienced a decrease in the
cea by .50% during  xxxd3077xxx  therapy (39, 45, and 47% of their

plotted versus dose of  xxxd3077xxx . the data were fit with a sigmoidal emax
model with the maximum effect set at 100%; with this constraint, the dose

on-study value). twenty-three patients with colorectal cancer were
treated with $2.8 mg/m2  xxxd3077xxx . eighteen of these patients had
prior  xxxd2462xxx -modulated 5-fu, 3 had prior adjuvant 5-fu plus
levamisole, and 2 had prior radiation therapy only. thus,  xxxd3077xxx 
did not appear to be active in colorectal cancer patients previously
treated with 5-fu/ xxxd2462xxx , whereas the numbers of patients with
no prior 5-fu/ xxxd2462xxx  were too small to draw any conclusions.
six tumor tissue specimens were available from patients
participating in this trial for determination of ts expression by
immunohistochemical analysis. four were from patients with
colorectal cancer (primary tumor at time of diagnosis, two
patients; metastatic tumor in the liver, one patient; and a recurrent abdominal mass after failing prior 5-fu/lv, one patient).
the primary tumor in a gastric cancer patient was biopsied at the
time of disease progression on this trial (20 days after starting
therapy); this patient had also failed a prior 5-fu/leucovorinbased regimen. the final sample was from a primary small cell
lung cancer at initial diagnosis. the interval from biopsy to
entry on this study was a median of 14.4 months (range, 20.7
to 31.2 months). the ts staining was diffuse in pattern and of
high intensity in all six tumor samples. none of these patients
responded to  xxxd3077xxx , and their median time to treatment
failure was 2.1 months (range, 0.6 – 6.7 months).

discussion
when tolerance to the initial cycle of  xxxd3077xxx  was considered, no dose level exceeded the definition of the mtd. because
3.0 mg/m2 had been selected for subsequent phase ii trials based on
the results of the european phase i trial, we expanded the number
of patients treated on our trial with the three highest dose levels.
when the tolerability of repeated cycles of therapy was considered,
about half of the patients treated with 4.0 or 4.5 mg/m2 experienced
unacceptable toxicity, generally within the first three cycles of
therapy. the asthenic syndrome occurred frequently. the etiology
of this constellation of symptoms is not clearly understood but has
been consistently reported in trials involving  xxxd3077xxx  (refs.

33–45; table 6). similar symptoms have been described in patients
receiving other antifolate drugs, including ag331 and ly231514,
as well as in structurally dissimilar antimetabolites like gemcitabine
(46–48). a granulocyte nadir below 500/ml of any duration was
considered to be dose-limiting in this trial, and colony-stimulating
factors were not used. in general, however, the duration of granulocytopenia was brief. transient elevations in serum transaminases
were also commonly seen. about two-thirds of the patients in this
trial had hepatic metastases, and 34% had elevated ast values
when they enrolled that would qualify for at least grade 1 toxicity.
the possible contribution of preexisting hepatic disease to
transaminitis while a patient is receiving drug is not clear, but
definite increases in both ast and alt levels were frequently
observed at midcycle. the policy of avoiding dose reductions if the
transaminase levels returned to the patient’s baseline value when
the next cycle of therapy was due appeared to be safe because
several patients who experienced transient grade 3 ast or alt
toxicity received subsequent cycles at the same dose with no
evidence of progressive hepatic dysfunction. four patients experienced transient rises in bilirubin that reached grade 3 in severity,
which were judged to be possibly treatment-related.
in our trial, mucositis and diarrhea did not appear to be
dose-related, and no patient experienced worse than grade 2 toxicity. there are differences between the criteria for diarrhea specified by the who (49) and the nci grading scales; the who
criteria focus on the duration of diarrhea for the early grades,
whereas the nci criteria are based on number of bowel movements
per day. the median reported frequency of grade 3 diarrhea was
10% (range, 0–24%) in clinical trials using the who criteria
(table 6), which seems to be somewhat higher than the frequency
(median, 0%; range, 0–4%) reported in five trials that used the nci
criteria. our observation that mucositis occurred infrequently is
consistent with the results of other trials involving  xxxd3077xxx .
interestingly, the frequency of leukopenia of grade 3–4 severity in
our patients treated with 3.5–4.5 mg/m2 did not appear to be
greater than that reported in other trials using 3.0 mg/m2.
over the dose range used in this study, the cmax and auc0 –24
h values increased in proportion to dose, whereas clearance was
independent of dose. an unanticipated observation was the variation in the duration of drug infusion during the pharmacokinetic
sampling periods. the precise duration of drug infusion was otherwise not routinely recorded, and it is possible that the durations of
drug infusion during other treatment cycles may not have been
uniform. infusions durations longer than the planned 15 min would
be expected to result in a lower cmax. whether such variations in
the infusion duration might impact on clinical toxicity is unclear.
although we had only limited data beyond four h post infusion, our
results are similar to that reported by clarke et al. (25). for
example, the cmax and auc0 –24 h in eight patients treated with
3.2–3.5 mg/m2 on our trial averaged 737 6 150 ng/ml and 1163 6
342 ngzh/ml, compared with 808 6 128 ng/ml and 1122 6 291
ngzh/ml in patients treated with 3.5 mg/m2 in the prior trial. although we found no relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and nonhematological toxicity, increasing cmax and auc0 –24
h values tended to be accompanied by greater declines in the
granulocyte count. our observation that  xxxd3077xxx  clearance
seemed to correlate with the estimated creatinine clearance suggests that renal excretion of drug may be an important mechanism
of elimination. beale et al. (50) conducted an extended pharmaco-

nr, not reported.

kinetic study in nine patients treated with a single dose of 3.0
mg/m2 [14c] xxxd3077xxx  and found that  xxxd3077xxx  was predominantly renally excreted as unchanged drug; only 29% of the drug
had been recovered in the urine by day 10. the average plasma
cmax (737 ng/ml) was in the same range as seen in both the current
and european phase i trials, but the total auc extrapolated to
infinity was ;2-fold higher. the terminal half-life was quite long
and varied widely among patients: 257 6 63 h (mean 6 sd). this
third phase of elimination is thought to represent slow release of
 xxxd3077xxx  monoglutamate from tissues into the circulation. as has
been reported for lometrexol, differences in tissue concentrations
and retention of  xxxd3077xxx  polyglutamates likely influences clinical
toxicity (51). it would be of interest to assess the potential impact
of this terminal phase of  xxxd3077xxx  elimination on clinical toxicity
in future studies. the same antibody used in the ria for measurement of  xxxd3077xxx  plasma levels can also be used to determine total
tissue levels of drug (52). thus, studies in which the extent of
 xxxd3077xxx  retention in normal tissue and tumor biopsies are now
feasible.
the possible contribution of the patient’s folate status to
sensitivity to various antifolate drugs is a subject of ongoing investigation. clinical experience with lometrexol indicated more
toxicity than was predicted on the basis of preclinical in vivo studies
(53). the fact that standard laboratory animal diets contain high
levels of  xxxd2146xxx  suggests that a relatively low dietary folate
intake in humans might contribute to the more severe toxicity. the
toxicity and therapeutic activity of lometrexol were markedly affected by folate status of mice with restricted dietary folate intake
(54). insufficient folate intake led to a marked increase in toxicity,
whereas excess folate reversed the antitumor activity. changes in
dietary folate intake modulate both  xxxg807xxx  expression and
folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity significantly in vivo (55, 56).
these preclinical data suggest that the tissue distribution and toxicities of antifolates that require polyglutamation for activation and
cellular retention may, indeed, be influenced by the folate status of
the host. clinical studies have also suggested that  xxxd2146xxx  or
 xxxd2147xxx  supplementation may ameliorate the clinical toxicity
associated with lometrexol therapy, but the impact on antitumor
efficacy is not clear (57). in our trial, slightly more than half the

patients had received  xxxd2462xxx -modulated 5-fu in the preceding
12 months. however, no clear-cut differences in toxicity were
apparent when recent  xxxd2462xxx  exposure was considered. rbc
folate levels were determined in only a minority of patients, and all
were in the normal range. whereas a markedly low rbc folate
level signifies a state of relative folate depletion, the test has limited
ability to distinguish more subtle differences in total body folate
levels. it will be of interest to learn whether other indicators of
folate status, such as homocysteine levels, may provide more useful
information concerning a patient’s dietary folate status and risk for
clinical toxicity with antifolate compounds.
because no objective responses were seen in 23 patients
with colorectal cancer treated with  xxxd3077xxx  doses of $2.8
mg/m2, our results suggest that with disease refractory to prior
 xxxd2462xxx -modulated 5-fu may be cross-resistant to  xxxd3077xxx . six patients were found to have high ts expression in
their tumor tissue. although the number of patients studied is
too small to draw meaningful conclusions, the observation suggests that future studies incorporating molecular profiling of
tumor tissue for markers that should influence  xxxd3077xxx  sensitivity might provide important prognostic information.
interestingly, one patient in our trial who received six cycles
of  xxxd3077xxx  without serious toxicity was subsequently found to
have profound  xxxg652xxx  deficiency (58).
kö xxxg694xxx  et al. (59) reported that  xxxd3077xxx  could be safely given to
patients who had experienced 5-fu-associated cardiac toxicity.
these clinical observations suggest that  xxxd3077xxx  is a therapeutic
option in patients who are 5-fu-intolerant.
in summary, we found that doses of  xxxd3077xxx  up to 4.5
mg/m2 for the initial cycle could be given safely, and doselimiting toxicity at the highest dose was observed in fewer than
one-quarter of patients. with repeated dosing, however, slightly
over half the patients receiving  xxxd3077xxx  at doses of 4.0 and 4.5
mg/m2 required a dose-reduction after a median of three and two
cycles, respectively. whereas dose-dependent clinical toxicity
with  xxxd3077xxx  seems apparent, there is considerable interpatient variability in tolerance to the side effects. the potential
impact of  xxxd3077xxx  dose on antitumor activity is not clear.
almost all phase ii and iii clinical trials involving single-agent

2390 phase i trial of  xxxd3077xxx 

 xxxd3077xxx  have used the 3.0 mg/m2 dose given as a 15-min
infusion every 3 weeks. two of three phase iii trials in colorectal cancer using 3.0 mg/m2 failed to demonstrate superiority
of  xxxd3077xxx  compared with 5-fu/lv given on a monthly
schedule; these studies were not sufficiently powered to demonstrate equivalence. the north american phase iii trial of
 xxxd3077xxx  initially included both a 3.0 and 4.0 mg/m2 arm, but
the higher dose was closed prematurely because of three deaths
which occurred among the initial 32 patients (31, 32). among
the trials involving 1213 patients presented in table 6, 26
possible treatment-related deaths were reported (2.1%). the
basis for the variability in individual tolerance is not known,
although data from our own and other trials suggest that impaired renal function may be a contributing factor (60). partially
on the basis of our experience, zeneca pharmaceuticals is now
sponsoring additional trials in north america using a higher
 xxxd3077xxx  dose (61, 62).
