contractile regulation of the na(+)-k(+)-2cl(-) cotransporter in vascular smooth muscle.  vasoconstrictors activate the na(+)-k(+)-2cl(-) cotransporter  xxxg2079xxx  in rat aortic smooth muscle, but the mechanism is unknown. efflux of (86)rb(+) from rat aorta in response to phenylephrine (pe) was measured in the absence and presence of bumetanide, a specific inhibitor of  xxxg2079xxx . removal of extracellular ca(2+) completely abolished the activation of  xxxg2079xxx  by pe. this was not due to inhibition of ca(2+)-dependent k(+) channels since blocking these channels with ba(2+) in ca(2+)-replete solution did not prevent activation of  xxxg2079xxx  by pe. stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by pe was inhibited 70% by 75 microm ml-9, 97% by 2 microm  xxxd3536xxx , and 70% by 2 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, each of which inhibited isometric force generation in aortic rings. bumetanide-insensitive rb(+) efflux, an indication of ca(2+)-dependent k(+) channel activity, was reduced by ml-9 but not by the other inhibitors. stretching of aortic rings on tubing to increase lumen diameter to 120% of normal almost completely blocked the stimulation of  xxxg2079xxx  by pe without inhibiting the stimulation by hypertonic shrinkage. we conclude that activation of the na(+)-k(+)-2cl(-) cotransporter by pe is the direct result of smooth muscle contraction through ca(2+)-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase. this indicates that the na(+)-k(+)-2cl(-) cotransporter is regulated by the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle.
