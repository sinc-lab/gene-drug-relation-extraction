inhibitors of dna methylation:
beyond myelodysplastic syndromes
pierre fenaux

introduction

s u m m a ry
dna methyltransferase ( xxxg644xxx ) inhibitors,  xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ®,
 xxxd3342xxx , boulder, co, usa) and  xxxd1823xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ™; supergen inc,
dublin, ca, usa, and mgi pharma inc, bloomington, mn, usa), have
had a significant impact on the treatment paradigm of myelodysplastic
syndromes (mdss), previously managed mainly by supportive care and
hematopoietic-stem-cell transplantation. the positive clinical experience
seen in mds to date coupled with the persistent challenges faced in the
treatment of other hematologic malignancies has served as the impetus
for further exploration of the therapeutic value of  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors
beyond mds. in that respect, the majority of data for these agents are
in the setting of acute myelogenous leukemia (aml). experience with
these agents in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in
transformation (reclassified by the world health organization as aml)
was also reported in the clinical trials submitted to the fda for approval
of  xxxd253xxx  for mds. some use has also been described in chronic
myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. further studies
are needed to clarify the appropriate dose and the number and duration
of cycles in the treatment of leukemias, and to identify ideal candidates for
therapy, explore the role of  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in combination with other
agents, especially histone deacetylase inhibitors, delineate differences
between the commercially available agents, and establish the long-term
safety of these agents. to this end, experience with  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in
hematologic malignancies other than mds is reviewed in an effort to
better understand the therapeutic potential of these agents and to define
areas of future exploration in these settings.

dna methyltransferase ( xxxg644xxx ) inhibitors
 xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ;  xxxd253xxx ®,  xxxd3342xxx 
corp., boulder, co, usa) and  xxxd1823xxx 
( xxxd1823xxx ™ ; supergen inc., dublin, ca, usa,
and mgi pharma inc., minneapolis, mn, usa)
have had a significant impact on the treatment
paradigm of myelodysplastic syndromes (mds),
previously managed mainly by supportive care
and hematopoietic-stem-cell transplantation
(hsct). although  xxxd253xxx  was synthesized
in the 1960s,1,2 its clinical value in the treatment
of mds did not become evident until 30 years
later, when studies conducted by silverman and
the cancer and leukemia group b (calgb)
showed response rates of 49–60% and the
superiority of this agent over best supportive
care.3–5 on the basis of these data,  xxxd253xxx 
became the first  xxxg644xxx  inhibitor to be approved
by the us fda for the treatment of mds.6
as the link between methylation and cancer
starts to become clearer, the potential benefit
of  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in the treatment of malignancies other than mds is being increasingly
explored.7 although heterogeneous in their
biological mechanisms and clinical progression, most leukemias share the characteristic of
being challenging to treat. despite our growing
understanding of the pathophysiology underlying acute leukemias, significant advancements in the treatment of these disorders have
not been made in recent years, with a few
exceptions such as acute promyelocytic
leukemia or philadelphia-chromosome-positive
(ph+) acute lymphocytic leukemia (all).
relapse after induction therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (aml) continues to be the
rule, except in acute  xxxg1785xxx ,
even in younger patients who have a high
likelihood of responding to initial treatment.
for younger adult patients (<60 years of age)
with aml, 1- and 5-year relative survival rates
are generally 50–60% and 25–30%, respectively.
prognosis is poorer in elderly people with
aml, because of unfavorable cytogenetics, the

presence of multiple comorbidities, and poor
performance status.8,9 rates of complete remission in older adults (>60 years of age) with
aml, who comprise the majority of patients
affected with this disease, are only 38–62%
when anthracycline-based regimens are used,
and the rate of long-term disease-free survival
is only 5–15%.10
for chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml),
although imatinib represents a significant
breakthrough, responses rates and durability
of responses with this agent vary depending on
disease stage, and resistance or relapse after a
short duration of therapy are common findings in the setting of advanced disease.11,12 on
the other hand, hsct, a potentially curative
treatment for cml, carries with it significant
morbidity.13
given the persistent challenges faced in
the treatment of leukemias and the positive
clinical experience seen with  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in mds to date, the most natural setting
for further examination of the therapeutic
potential of these agents is in leukemias. the
majority of information for  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors,
outside mds, is in the setting of aml, which
is not surprising in light of the known similarities between mds and aml in cytogenetic
and clinical features.14,15 some use of these
drugs has also been reported in cml and all.
experience with  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in these
hematologic malignancies is reviewed here in
order to define areas for future exploration and
to develop strategies that effectively incorporate
these agents in these settings.
dna methylation in leukemia

dna methylation is an epigenetic phenomenon
that appears to play an important role in cancer
initiation and progression by suppression of
genes essential for the control of normal cell
growth and differentiation.15–17 in mammals,
dna methylation is catalyzed primarily by three
dna methyltransferases, dnmt1,  xxxg645xxx ,
and dnmt3b, and occurs largely at the cytosine residues contained within the dinucleotide
sequence cytosine-phosphate diesterguanine
(cpg).18,19 fully methylated cpg islands
(areas of increased density of cpgs) are found
exclusively in the promoter regions of selected
imprinted autosomal genes and various silenced
genes on the inactivated x chromosome of
females.15 the exact mechanism by which
dna methylation modulates gene expression

in cancer treatment is still being elucidated.
a vast number of genes involved in leukemogenesis have been characterized by cpg island
hypermethylation.20 one study found that 19
of 20 bone marrow samples from aml patients
were characterized by an abnormal methylation pattern in at least one gene, including the
genes coding for calcitonin,  xxxg730xxx ,
cdh1, p15, p16, rb1,  xxxg996xxx , and hic1.
by contrast, none of eight genes tested was
found to be methylated in any of the control
samples.21 more specifically, hypermethylation
of the p15 tumor-suppressor gene has been
observed in at least half of patients with cml,
all, and aml.22,23 an abnormal increase in
the number of cpg sites of the calcitonin gene
was found in 95% of tumor cell dna samples
from patients with aml24 and has been linked
to cml transformation into accelerated and
blastic phases.25 hypermethylation of the p21
gene was documented in 41% of bone marrow
samples from patients with all, and multivariate analysis showed this was an independent
risk factor for a poor prognosis.26
interference with methylation at the level of
methyltransferases is currently being explored
as a strategy to reactivate quiescent genes that
inhibit cancer initiation and progression.27
 xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  are the first  xxxg644xxx 
inhibitors to be described.1 these pyrimidine
analogs of cytidine incorporate into rna and
dna, respectively, and form covalent complexes
with dnmts, leading to depletion of active
enzymes (figure 1).  xxxd253xxx  also incorporates into rna, giving rise to defective messenger
and transfer rna, ultimately resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.28 aside from methyltransferase inhibition, these agents are cytotoxic
in higher doses, because they directly interfere
with dna synthesis.27,28

the majority of clinical data for  xxxd253xxx  in
the treatment of leukemia has been as salvage
therapy, either as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs in the setting
of refractory or relapsed aml.29–40 it has been
studied to a lesser extent in previously untreated
aml41–43 or for the treatment of cml.44,45
highly variable response rates (0–58%) with
 xxxd253xxx  have been observed across these
clinical settings.

many of the early findings were most likely
attributable to a disparity among reports in the
dose of  xxxd253xxx  studied, baseline disease
severity of the study population, and the
criteria used to define clinical and hematologic
responses. interpretation of these data has been
further limited by various factors relating to
study design and methodology. many of the
studies with  xxxd253xxx  for leukemia treatment have been observational or unblinded
in design, and evaluation of the drug’s safety
and efficacy was not the primary objective.
especially in the early reports,  xxxd253xxx 
was studied at much higher doses than are
currently indicated for mds (75 mg/m2 per
day subcutaneously daily for 7 days), and it was
found to have serious dose-limiting toxicities,
including myelosuppression, that overshadowed its potential utility as an antileukemic
agent. in addition, many of the studies evaluated  xxxd253xxx  in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents, thus hindering the
ability to draw definitive conclusions about its
contribution to treatment outcomes.
saiki et al.34 carried out one of the earliest
and largest clinical studies with  xxxd253xxx  as
a single agent for the treatment of leukemia.
five different dosage regimens, ranging
from 150 mg/m2 for 10 days by continuous
intravenous infusion to 750 mg/m2 for 1 day
by intermittent intravenous infusion, were
compared in adult patients with acute leukemia
of all cell types who were in relapse. all patients
had received prior aggressive chemotherapy.
of the 170 patients entered into the study, efficacy end points were fully evaluable in only 120.
the overall response rate at the end of the trial
was 9.2%, with nine patients achieving complete

s38 nature clinical practice oncology

remission and two achieving partial remission.
lower dose schedules (150 mg/m2 × 10 days
and 200 mg/m2 × 7 days) were associated with
higher remission rates. however, the difference
in outcomes among the various dose schedules was not statistically significant, perhaps
because of the low number of patients assigned
to each group. compared with nonresponders,
responders to therapy were younger (39.5 versus
31 years) and had a smaller proportion of blasts
in the peripheral blood (46% versus 7%).
response to prior treatment did not appear to
be a predictor of a positive outcome. nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea, the most commonly
reported adverse events, were observed to the
least extent in patients receiving the lower-dose
continuous infusions. prolonged myelosuppression was noted in approximately 7% of patients,
and, unlike in other studies with  xxxd253xxx ,
was not dose-related. coma was reported in 15
patients; however, in 13 of these, an underlying
etiology for central nervous system disturbances
unrelated to drug toxicity was present. these
findings suggested that low-dose continuous
infusion schedules of  xxxd253xxx  might be
more effective, with acceptable toxicity, and that
further evaluation of  xxxd253xxx  in combination
with other agents is warranted.
 xxxd1823xxx 

 xxxd1823xxx  shares a similar history with  xxxd253xxx  in that its clinical development relied on
the use of very high doses (up to 2,250 mg/m2)
administered over short treatment courses.46–53
furthermore, its use was limited by excessive and
delayed myelosuppression. it was not until the
results from more recent phase i and ii studies
became available that  xxxd1823xxx  was recognized as a promising agent for the treatment of
mds,54,55 aml,55 and cml,55,56 even in patients
who had failed prior therapies.  xxxd1823xxx  has
also been successfully used as part of a conditioning regimen prior to hsct57 and as a single
agent with stem-cell reinfusion for relapse after
allogeneic progenitor-cell transplant in patients
with advanced acute leukemia and cml.58

primary induction therapy to patients who
ranged in age from 44 to 80 years and with bone
marrow blast counts ranging from 20% to 38%.
eight patients experienced either complete or
partial remission in an average of three cycles.
duration of response averaged 8 (range, 6–
13) and 3 (range, 2–3) cycles in the groups of
patients who achieved complete and partial
remission, respectively. adverse drug events
included febrile neutropenia, associated with
two deaths, and anorexia necessitating drug
discontinuation in one patient.
in the setting of relapses, lee et al.38 did not
observe any consistent clinical or hematologic
response in 11 adult patients with refractory or
relapsed aml who were poor candidates for
standard cytotoxic therapy. patients were treated
with intravenous  xxxd253xxx  at a dose of 75 mg/m2
daily continuously for 7 days every 4–6 weeks.
these observations were most likely attributable
to such pretreatment variables as the severity of
their disease (five patients died during the study

period or shortly thereafter), advanced age
(median, 55 years; range, 36–78 years), and the
fact that five courses administered to three
patients were unevaluable.
in addition to these studies, over 100 patients
with refractory anemia with excess blasts in
transformation (raebt) or aml were exposed
to  xxxd253xxx  in the clinical trials submitted
to the fda for approval of  xxxd253xxx  in
mds.3,4,62,63 these data are especially relevant
in light of the reclassification by the world
health organization of raebt as aml.64
among these trials were two phase ii studies
carried out by silverman and the calgb, both
of which involved administration of  xxxd253xxx 
75 mg/m2 daily as a continuous intravenous

7 days every 28 days to patients with high-risk

aml is available from experiences reported
in high-risk mds, including raebt. in one
of the largest studies to correlate cytogenetic
status with response to  xxxd1823xxx  therapy in
patients with mds, wijermans et al.54 reported
the highest percentage of responders (14 of 20
patients; 70%) to a 3-day course of  xxxd1823xxx 
15 mg/m2 daily in the group of patients with
raebt. another valuable finding was the positive correlation between cytogenetic risk category and response rate, with the greatest number
of prs and crs observed among patients with
high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. chromosome 7 anomalies, complex cytogenetics).
lower doses of  xxxd1823xxx  were also studied
recently by issa and colleagues55 at the md
anderson cancer center at houston in a phase
i trial involving patients with advanced
leukemia or mds who had failed at least one
prior regimen (cml, all) or had relapsed
after induction (aml, mds). analysis of p15
dna methylation was also carried out in order
to quantify the ratio of methylated versus
unmethylated polymerase chain reaction
product and density of methylation. a total of
48 patients received various doses of  xxxd1823xxx  ranging from 5 mg/m2 daily to 20 mg/m2
daily intravenously over 1 h for 10–20 days
approximately every 6 weeks.
overall, objective responses were noted in
16 patients (33%). in 37 patients with aml,
5 (14%) achieved cr, defined as disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the
disease, normalization of peripheral counts,
and normal bone marrow morphology. three
patients (8%) achieved partial response (pr). in
seven patients with mds, two (28.5%) achieved
complete response (cr) and two achieved pr.
in five patients with cml, two achieved cr and
two achieved pr. in eight of nine patients, only
one cycle of therapy was required to achieve
a cr. although objective responses were
achieved with all doses of  xxxd1823xxx , treatment with higher doses (20 mg/m2 for 10 days)
and in longer treatment cycles (15 mg/m2 for
20 days) were associated with significantly fewer
response rates (45% versus 11%, p = 0.01). the
most common nonhematologic adverse effects
observed were severe elevation in liver function tests (12%), elevation in serum creatinine
(10%), and nausea/vomiting (4%). febrile
episodes were reported in 26 patients (52%), in
18 (69%) of whom they were associated with a
documented infection.

the study did not show a correlation
between p15 methylation and response to
therapy. samples for 25 patients were available
for analysis of p15 methylation. no significant
decline in methylation at post-treatment days
5 and 12 with  xxxd1823xxx  were noted in any
of these patients, regardless of their clinical
response. dna samples from only two of the six
patients who achieved a clinical response and
had baseline and on-treatment samples available were found to be methylated. methylation
status in these patients remained unchanged at
days 5 and 12 after therapy.
kantarjian et al.56 carried out a phase ii
study in which  xxxd1823xxx  was administered to
130 patients with cmls in transformation, 123
of whom had ph+ cml (64 blastic, 51 accelerated, 8 chronic). patients were initially treated
with  xxxd1823xxx  100 mg/m2 over 6 h every 12 h
for 5 days every 4–8 weeks. the dose was then
reduced to 75 mg/m2 over 6 h every 12 h for
5 days after the first 13 patients experienced
severe prolonged myelosuppression, and then
to 50 mg/m2 in the remaining 84 patients. a
complete hematologic response (chr) was
defined as normalization of peripheral blood
counts and differentials with 5% or fewer
blasts in the bone marrow for at least 4 weeks.
hematologic improvement was equivalent
to chr, with persistent thrombocytopenia
and a few immature cells in the peripheral
blood. partial hematologic response (phr)
was similar to chr but allowed for persistent
palpable splenomegaly and/or few immature
cells. a return to the second chronic phase
was defined by the disappearance of blastic
phase features and a return to chronic phase
features.
overall, 18 patients (28%) in the blastic
phase achieved an objective response,
including 6 chr, 7 hematologic improvement
(hi), 2 phr, and 3 second chronic phase.
similarly, 28 patients (55%) in the accelerated
phase achieved objective responses, including
12 chr, 10 phr, 3 hi, and 3 second chronic
phase. in the chronic phase, one patient
achieved chr and four demonstrated phr.
of the remaining seven patients with ph–
cml, four showed an objective response (two
chr, one phr, one second chronic phase).
the median survival rate was 5 months and
17 months in the blastic and accelerated
phase, respectively. a median of three courses
was required to achieve the best hematologic

response. there was no significant difference in the response rate according to dose
of  xxxd1823xxx . the most commonly reported
nonhematological adverse effects were drug
fever (21%), diarrhea (5%), nausea or emesis
(4%), fatigue (2%), cardiac events (2%), and
alopecia (2%). dose-related myelosuppression
was significant and was complicated by febrile
episodes in 48 patients (37%) and infections
in 44 (34%).
the future: areas for exploration

decades after having been discovered, the
 xxxg644xxx  inhibitors are re-emerging as viable
therapeutic modalities, not only for the treatment of mds, but also potentially for other
hematologic malignancies such as aml and
cml. the finding that gene silencing by methylation is a feature of a wide variety of tumor
types, coupled with the novel and distinct
mechanism by which  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors exert
their antineoplastic effects, supports further
exploration of the therapeutic value of these
agents beyond that in mds alone.
a number of issues will need to be addressed
by future studies in order to fully exploit the
therapeutic potential of these agents as alternatives or adjunct agents to standard therapies in
the setting of leukemia. first, there are dosing
considerations. investigators need to clarify
what would be the optimal dose, length of
each cycle, and number of cycles to maximize
clinical response. with few exceptions, clinical
studies with  xxxd253xxx  and  xxxd1823xxx  thus
far demonstrate a greater benefit when these
agents are used in lower doses, rather than in
their maximum tolerated doses, suggesting
that the therapeutic potential of these agents
lies largely in their hypomethylating effects,
and not in direct inhibition of tumor cells, an
effect that becomes more pronounced when
higher doses are used. furthermore, it is not
yet well defined whether the hypomethylating
effects of these agents are time-dependent
such that better clinical responses are achieved
using treatment cycles longer than the 5- to
7-day cycles now used. another factor that
will be important to take into consideration in
determining the optimal schedule of administration of  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors will be cell-cycle
parameters of leukemic stem cells. the high
sensitivity of cells in the s phase to  xxxd253xxx 
and  xxxd1823xxx  suggests that these agents act
largely in a cell-cycle-phase-specific manner

and may imply that their antileukemic effect
is schedule-dependent.32,65
another issue to be addressed is that studies
are needed to clarify which patient types would
be the best candidates, based upon response
to previous treatment and cytogenetic status.
phase i/ii studies with both  xxxd253xxx  and
 xxxd1823xxx  are currently under way in patients
with aml, all, cml, and cll (table 2). in
the setting of aml, it will be important to
answer the question as to whether the role of
 xxxg644xxx  inhibitors should be used as salvage
therapy in patients who relapse or are refractory to front-line treatment, or as maintenance
therapy in patients who have achieved pr or
cr to intensive chemotherapy. the positive
responses achieved with  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in
patients with mds/aml who are older or who
display unfavorable cytogenetics should serve
as the impetus for future studies focusing on
these agents as first-line therapy in patients
who are not candidates for standard intensive
chemotherapy, because of these factors. of
particular relevance to the treatment of aml
will be results from ongoing phase iii studies
in mds patients with raebt. mds patients
with this subtype have similarities to those with
aml in cytogenetic (e.g. presence of complex
abnormalities), biologic, and clinical (e.g. poor
response to chemotherapy) features. there are
also encouraging responses already reported by
the calgb trial studies and wijermans et al.
for these patients.14,54,66–69
a third issue to address is that direct comparisons between  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors are needed
before conclusions about the relative efficacy
and safety of these two agents can be made.
a further consideration involves combination therapy. studies using  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors
in combination with other agents should be
explored further in this setting. given their
unique mechanism of action, the potential for
enhanced clinical response when  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors are used in combination with standard
therapies, including biologi cal, cytotoxic,
and hormonal agents, should be examined.
ongoing phase i/ii trials are evaluating the
combination of  xxxd253xxx  with gemtuzumab,
 xxxd253xxx  with etanercept, and  xxxd1823xxx 
with imatinib. perhaps of greater importance will be results from studies focusing on
the concomitant or sequential use of  xxxg644xxx 
inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors,
as this strategy is supported by a mechanistic

rationale that may translate into a synergistic
effect on the reactivation of epigenetically
silenced genes that is not possible with other
combinations.70
finally, long-term follow up should be
conducted in patients receiving  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors, alone or in combination, to assess critically
important disease end points such as duration
of remission and mortality, as well as patient
safety. one issue that requires clarification is the

potential clinical implications of methyltransferase inhibition resulting in the activation of
genes that play a role in normal cellular maintenance.71–73 in addressing such questions,
clinicians can better understand the potential
of  xxxg644xxx  inhibitors in the management of
hematologic malignancies beyond mds and
implement strategies for using these agents in
a way that will optimize patient outcomes in
this setting.
