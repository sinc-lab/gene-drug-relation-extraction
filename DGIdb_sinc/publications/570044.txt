abstract-low concentrations of the antibacterial agent  xxxd2274xxx  (hcp) inhibited a number of
pyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenase enzymes, including bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase
( xxxg911xxx ), beef heart  xxxg1739xxx  (mdh), torula yeast  xxxd1292xxx  dehydrogenase
(g-6-p-d), horse liver  xxxg110xxx  (adh), pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), and beef
heart lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). initial velocity studies at appropriate enzyme concentrations gave
i,, values for the dehydrogenases which ranged between 1.6 pm for  xxxg911xxx  and 105 fm for icd and ldh.
more detailed kinetic analyses of g-6-p-d, icd and  xxxg911xxx  showed that inhibition by hcp in most cases
was of the nonconipetitive type. calculations made from the kinetic data gave apparent k, values with
g-6-p-d, of 59 pm for nadp+ and of 38 pm for glucose bphosphate; with icd, of 1.opm for nadp+
and of 25 pm for isocitrate; and, with  xxxg911xxx , of 2.0 cm for nadh, of 7.4 pm for a-ketoglutarate, and of
2.3 pm for ammonium acetate.

determination of dehydrogenase activities. all dehydrogenase activities were measured spectrophotometrically at w by following the initial velocity of
pyridine nucleotide oxidation or reduction as an
increase or decrease of absorbance with respect tu
time at 340 nm. all enzyme assays were carried out in
triplicate (except where indicated otherwise) in l-ml
quartz cuvettes in a gilford model 2000 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell compartment
maintained at 30”. a tight fitting aluminum holder
held at the same temperature was utilized to prewarm
the cuvettes and their contents. reactions were
initiated by the addition of enzymes, which had been
stored at 0”, into the prewarmed reaction mixture.
the amount of enzyme added was adjusted so that the
initial rate ofreduction or oxidation of pyridine nucleotide was linear, and proportional
to the enzyme
concentration.
g-6-p-d was assayed by a modification of the
method described in the worthington enzyme manual
[14]. the assay mixture contained 0.05 m trishcl buffer (ph 7.5), 0.48 mm nadp+, 0.85 mm

genases from bacillus megaterium [lo]; and lactate
dehydrogenase of animal origin [ll, 12).
in the present study, we report the inhibition by
hcp of a number of pyridine nucleotide-dependent
dehydrogenases, including  xxxg110xxx 
(adh),
glucose
6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(g-dp;d),
glutamate dehydrogenase ( xxxg911xxx ), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), lactate dehydrogenase

enzyme/ml (or as indicated in the text).  xxxg911xxx  was
analyzed [ 151 using 4 pg enzyme/ml. icd activity was
measured [16] using 4 fig enzyme/ml, but the final
buffer was 0.05 m. mdh was measured [17j at a
concentration of 0.9 pg enzyme/ml. this enzyme was
quite unstable and, therefore, the final values were
corrected for decay. adh was analyzed [18] using
2.2 pg enzyme/ml. ldh activity was followed [19]
using 0.1 fig enzyme/ml; glycylglycine buffer, ph 7.5,
however, was used in place of phosphate buffer,
ph 7.0, to give higher dissolved hcp concentrations.
hcp was added to the assay mixtures dissolved
either in 0.02 n naoh or 95% ethanol. in most
instances, the chlorinated bisphenol was initially
dissolvedin 0.4 n naoh, diluted 20-fold with distilled
water and then a 0.02~ml aliquot of this solution was
added to the assay mixture. in order to prepare higher
concentrations of hcp for the i,, determinations,
however, hcp was dissolved in 95% ethanol, and
then a 0.02-ml aliquot of this solution was added to
the assay mixture. controls contained comparable
amounts of dilute naoh or ethanol.
presentation of data and calculation of results. mean
reaction rates from two to five assays were used in an
interactive computer program [20] to prepare lineweaver-burk plots [21] and to calculate hill or
interaction coefficients [22]. computer outputs gave
values of k,,, (michaelis-menten
constant), v_
(maximum reaction rate), slope of lineweaver-burk
plot, q,,, (intersection of the line of the lineweaverburk plot on y axis), and n or n’ (hill or interaction
coefficient) of substrate binding sites or inhibitor
binding sites respectively. the experimental inhibition
constants, kislopo(values varied with inhibitor concentration), were calculated using the computer
output kinetic values to fit webb’s method [23, 241.
apparent inhibition constants (k, values) were estimated according to segel[25] by replotting the recipvalues vs the corresponding hcp
rocal of the k.
concentration.“l
i 50 values (inhibitor concentrations which caused 50 per cent inhibition under the
experimental conditions) were determined visually
from semilogarithmic plots of percentage inhibition
vs inhibitor concentration.

effect of hcp on various dehydrogenases. hcp, in

the micromolar range, inhibited all of the pyridine
nucleotide dehydrogenases tested, yielding i,, values
ranging between 1.6 pm for  xxxg911xxx  and 105 ph for
icd and ldh (fig. 1, table i). the sigmoid shape of
the inhibition curves (fig. 1a) suggested the possibility
ofcooperative interactions between inhibitory binding
sites on the enzyme molecule [26]. these data were
plotted, therefore, according to the following empirical
inhibition hill equation [22, 251:

reversibility of hcp inhibition. bovine serum
albumin (bsa) binds hcp strongly;* hence, this
protein was used to remove hcp from the reaction
mixture containing the dehydrogenase enzyme and
hcp.
reversibility of hcp inhibition to three enzymes
was tested. addition of bsa (osmg/ml) to bovine
liver  xxxg911xxx  and pig heart icd in the presence of hcp
resulted in almost complete restoration of the enzyme
activity (fig. 2a and b). the addition of bsa
(0.2 mg/ml) to the inhibited torula yeast g-6-p-d
reaction mixture, on the other hand, showed only a
partial (20-30 per cent) reversal of the inhibition by
bsa (data not shown).
kinetic studies of the interaction of hcp with
g-6-p-d, icd and  xxxg911xxx . three of the dehydrogenases

were selected for more detailed kinetic studies.
lineweaver-burk plots in the presence of various
concentrations of hcp are shown for g-6-p-d (fig.
3a and b), icd (fig. 4a and b) and  xxxg911xxx  (fig. 5).
in most cases, noncompetitive inhibition of the three
dehydrogenaaes occurred with hcp. kinetic constants
for the various dehydrogeoases
were calculated

[23-251 and are presented in table 2. hcp exhibited
no effect on substrate binding as evidence by hill
coefficient (n) values [27] that varied between 0.97
and 1.o!l,-whether hcp was present or not.
the secondary plot or replot [25, 281 of the slopes
of the lineweaver-burk plot for hcp inhibition of
g-6-p-d was almost a linear function of hcp
concentration (fig 3c), but showed a slight curvature
for the replot of the intercepts (fig. 3d). while the
slope. and intercept replots for hcp inhibition of icd
were curved strongly in the case of isocitrate, similar
replots for this enzyme with nadp+ as the variable
substrate were nearly linear (fig. 4c and d). replots
of slopes and intercepts for hcp inhibition of  xxxg911xxx 
(fig 6) yielded parabolic curves for both ammonium
acetate and a-ketoglutarate (fig 6a and b). however,
for nadh the slope replot was linear (fig. 6c) and
the intercept replot curved (fig. 6d).
discussion
the results of the present study and those of previous
investigators [10-121 show that hcp is an effective
inhibitor of dehydrogeoase enzymes of both bacterial
and animal origin. the sigmoid shape of the inhibition

curves(fig. 1a)suggested t~possibilityofcoo~rative
interactions between in~bition binding sites on the
enzyme [26]. the relationship between velocity and
inhibitor concentration was examined further by the
use of the hill equation [22,25]. the slopes (n’ values)
of the resulting hill plots (fig 1b) were generally
greater than 1.o,providing furtherevidcnce that hcp
interacted with the enzymes cooperatively. interaction
coefficients (n’ value) for hcp with  xxxg911xxx , mdh,
g-6-p-d, adh, ed or ldh ranged between 1.62
and 3.33 (table l), suggesting that the minimum
number of inhibitory
binding sites per enzyme
molecule may be two or three [22,25,29,30], assuming
that hcp did not irreversibly inhibit or denature the
enzymes tested.

the slopes of the hill plots for the inhibitor were
not constant but increased with rather sharp transitions as the concentration of hcp increased. such
results might be explained by the presence of multiple
inhibitorysites with different affinities for the bispheno1 inhibitor .on the enzyme [25] or by the enzyme
changingfranra state of low affinity to states of higher
a&&y for the inhibitor [31]. slopes of hill, plots that
vary with inhibitor ~n~ntra~on
have also been
observed for purine ribonucleotide
inhibitors of

inhibition of g-6-p-d, icd and  xxxg911xxx -by*hcp was

generally noncompetitive, as evidence& l@‘the lineweaver-burk plots (figs. 3a-b, 4a-b’.*and 5a-b).
while hcp inhibition of membrane-associatedmdh
from b. meguterium was also noncompetitive [lo], the
bisphenol inhibited soluble mdh from the same source
by a partially competitive mechanism.
more detailed characterization
of the type of
inhibitibd&een in the present studies may he obtained
from replots of the stopes and intercepts of the reciprocal plots [25, 28, 33). such secondary plots for

g-6-p-d (fig. 3c and d) are almost linear for the
slope, and probably hyperbolic for the intercept with
respect to both substrates. following a more complete
designation [28, 333. inhibition of g-6-p-d.by hcp
may, therefore, be classified as slope-linear, intercepthyperbolic, noncompetitive
inhibition.
nonlinear
secondary plots are indicative of complex inhibition
involving at least two mechanisms for inhibition of the
enzyme [25,34].
inhibition of icd by hcp appeared to be noncompetitive with respect to nadp+ but competitive for

isocitrate (fig, 4a and b). the inhibition kinetics for
 xxxg911xxx  were more complex, apparently being competitive for the ammonium ion (fig 5a), noncompetitive

with respect to a-keto~u~~te
(fig. 53) but uncompetitive for nadh (fig. sc). secondary plots of the
slopes and intercepts from the reciprocal plots for
hcp inhibition of these enzymes were generally
parabolbfn’hature, although linear curves were found
with some substrates (figs. 46 and d, and 6).
the source of curvature in the slope and intercept
replots is most likely due to the presence of at least
two inhibitory sites on the enzyme molecules [25,
34-361. as an example of such a mechanism, two
phenol molecules were shown recently [36l to bind
to two separate inhibitory sites on porcine heart
mdh. one molecule was bound as phenol, the other
as a charge transfer complex of phenol with nadc

thus, there could be two or more hcp inhibition
sites on each molecule of g-6-p-d, icd or  xxxg911xxx .
alternatively, as in the case of mdh and phenol [36],
there may be separate inhibitory sites that bind hcp
and a hcp-substrate complex respectively.
since pyridine-nucleotide-dependent
dehydrogenases catalyze oxidation-reduction
reactions essential in controlling cellular metabolism, their inhibition
by hcp could have serious adverse effects on biological systems. whether such inhibition okcurs in vivo
and plays a role in the toxicity of hcp [l-4], however,
remains to be established.
