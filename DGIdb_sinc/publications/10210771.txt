elevated circulating levels of soluble interleukin-1 receptor type ii during interleukin-2 immunotherapy.  interleukin-1 (il-1) is a critical mediator of inflammation. two naturally occurring il-1 antagonists have been described, namely the  xxxd2806xxx  ( xxxg1172xxx ) and the il-1 receptor type ii (il-1rii). il-1rii does not transmit a signal upon binding of il-1, but competes with the signaling of il-1ri for binding of il-1. shedding of il-1rii yields the soluble il-1 receptor type ii (il-1srii) which retains the ability of membrane-bound il-1rii to bind  xxxg1170xxx  avidly, but binds  xxxg1172xxx  and il-1alpha with low affinity. in contrast, il-1sri retains the ability of membrane-bound il-1ri to bind  xxxg1172xxx  and il-1alpha with high affinity, but binds  xxxg1170xxx  poorly. we have previously shown that immunotherapy with il-2 or il-6 in cancer patients is associated with a dramatic increase in  xxxg1172xxx  plasma levels. in the present study, plasma levels of soluble il-1 receptors were monitored in healthy individuals and cancer patients. in healthy controls, the mean il-1srii level was 4.76 0.16 ng/ml. il-1srii levels in cancer patients were comparable to those measured in healthy controls. il-1srii levels did not vary during the first 52 hours after initiation of il-2 therapy, but increased significantly thereafter to reach 9.56 1.16 ng/ml on day 5. in contrast, il-6 immunotherapy with a 5-day continuous infusion did not trigger an increase in il-1srii levels. il-1sri levels did not increase during immunotherapy with il-2 or il-6. our results indicate that il-1srii, unlike  xxxg1172xxx , remains a modest, natural, anti-inflammatory mechanism triggered by immunotherapy with il-2, but not with il-6.
