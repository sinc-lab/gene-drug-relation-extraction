many nucleoside analog drugs, such as ribavirin and viramidine, are activated or metabolized in vivo
through 5ⴕ-phosphorylation. in this report, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for 5ⴕ-monophosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by  xxxg79xxx . the apparent km for ribavirin is 540 ␮m,
and kcat is 1.8 minⴚ1. its catalytic efficiency of 3.3 ⴛ 10ⴚ3 minⴚ1 · ␮mⴚ1 is 1,200-fold lower than that of
adenosine. in contrast to the common belief that ribavirin is exclusively phosphorylated by  xxxg79xxx ,
cytosolic 5ⴕ-nucleotidase ii was found to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. the reaction is optimally
stimulated by the physiological concentration of atp or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. in phosphate-buffered saline
plus atp and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the apparent km for ribavirin is 88 ␮m, and kcat is 4.0 minⴚ1. these
findings suggest that cytosolic 5ⴕ-nucleotidase ii may be involved in ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo. like
ribavirin, viramidine was found to be phosphorylated by either  xxxg79xxx  or cytosolic 5ⴕ-nucleotidase
ii, albeit with a much lower activity. the catalytic efficiency for viramidine phosphorylation is 10- to 330-fold
lower than that of ribavirin, suggesting that other nucleoside kinase(s) may be involved in viramidine
phosphorylation in vivo. both ribavirin and viramidine are not phosphorylated by  xxxg611xxx  and
uridine-cytidine kinase. the coincidence of presence of high concentrated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes suggests that cytosolic 5ⴕ-nucleotidase ii could play an important role in phosphorylating ribavirin and
contribute to anabolism of  xxxd3111xxx  in erythrocytes. elucidation of ribavirin and viramidine
phosphorylation mechanism should shed light on their in vivo metabolism, especially the ribavirin-induced
hemolytic anemia in erythrocytes.
lular gtp pool for 5⬘-cap synthesis of rna transcripts and
viral genome synthesis (33). both ribavirin diphosphate (rdp)
and triphosphate (rtp) have been implicated as competitive
inhibitors with cognate nucleoside triphosphates for a number
of viral rna polymerases, such as hcv rna-dependent rna
polymerase and influenza viral rna polymerase (15, 36). moreover, ribavirin can act as a viral mutagen by imitating adenosine or guanosine to base pair with either thymidine or cytidine
in a viral genome. because of this promiscuity, incorporation
of rtp into a viral genome could induce transitional mutation
and culminate virus error catastrophe (8). additionally, as an
analog of guanosine nucleotide, rtp can be incorporated by
rna guanylyl transferase in the place of gmp to produce
defected 5⬘-cap structure for viral rna transcripts, attributing to a decrease of viral genome translation (6, 12). these
described mechanisms of action are interlinked, as the suppression of intracellular gtp pool by inhibiting impdh potentiates ribavirin’s effect as an alternative nucleotide for competitive inhibition and incorporation. in terms of ribavirin’s
immunomodulatory activity, evidences suggest that ribavirin
can function as a small molecule immunomodulator and elicit
t-cell-mediated immunity that favors elimination of intracellular viral pathogens (34). the fact that no ribavirin resistance
has ever been cogently identified in a clinical setting indirectly
supports the notion that ribavirin exerts antiviral effect through
pleiotropic action mechanisms.
despite the well-documented antiviral activity, the clinical
application of ribavirin is somehow restricted due to some
serious adverse effects, especially the ribavirin-induced hemo-

although originally discovered more than 30 years ago, ribavirin remains the only approved small molecule antiviral drug
that is active against both dna and rna viruses (28). ribavirin is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration
for the treatment of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infection and in combination with alpha-interferon for chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection (26). more recently, therapeutic
benefits of ribavirin have been realized for the treatment of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (16) and smallpox virus
infection, a potential bioterrorist threat (1). these clinical successes have generated a renewed interest in understanding
ribavirin’s action mechanism. structurally ribavirin is a purine
 xxxd2246xxx  analog capable of mimicking inosine, guanosine, or adenosine (fig. 1). this unique propensity enables
ribavirin to concomitantly target multiple viral and host enzymes utilizing  xxxd2705xxx  or nucleotide as a substrate
or cofactor. the active form of ribavirin comprises its three
5⬘-phosphorylated derivatives. they exert antiviral activity by
interfering with several critical steps required for viral replication, including host nucleotide biosynthesis, viral genome transcription, and translation. ribavirin 5⬘-monophosphate (rmp)
is a potent inhibitor for host imp dehydrogenase (impdh). it
disrupts the de novo synthesis of gmp and depletes intracel* corresponding author. mailing address: drug discovery, valeant

lytic anemia (11). accumulation of ribavirin phosphates in
erythrocytes or red blood cells (rbcs) attributes to hemolytic
anemia in a significant percentage of treated hcv patients,
many of whom require dose reduction or discontinuation of
therapy. viramidine, a 3-carboxamidine derivative of ribavirin,
is a prodrug of ribavirin. it can be activated and converted to
ribavirin by  xxxg62xxx  in vitro (39). pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that this prodrug is capable of delivering more ribavirin to the liver with a reduced propensity to be
trapped in rbcs (20, 38). in addition to the prodrug mechanism, viramidine may concurrently act as a catabolic inhibitor
and slow down the catabolic rate of newly converted ribavirin
from viramidine (37). because of these favorable pharmacokinetic properties, viramidine is currently in clinical trials for the
treatment of chronic hcv infection.
ribavirin requires 5⬘-phosphorylation to be pharmacologically active. in the literature, it is generally believed that 5⬘monophosphorylation of ribavirin is exclusively catalyzed by
 xxxg79xxx . a partially purified rat liver lysate containing
both adenosine and 2⬘-deoxyadenosine kinase activities was
first observed to possess ribavirin phosphorylation activity in
vitro (32). further studies with cell lines deficient in adenosine
kinase expression suggested that  xxxg79xxx  is responsible for ribavirin phosphorylation (33, 35). however, it is unknown whether the  xxxg79xxx  deficiency has any effect
on the cellular concentration of atp and thereby impairs
other nucleoside phosphorylation pathways. interestingly, despite the deficiency, a small amount of rtp is produced in
these cell lines (24). more recently,  xxxg79xxx  purified
from chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells (13) and rabbit liver
(22) were employed to demonstrate that it catalyzes ribavirin
phosphorylation in vitro. yet the kinetics of the reaction has
not been fully characterized. although  xxxg79xxx  is
capable of catalyzing ribavirin phosphorylation, the observed
activity thus far is low. one study revealed that the reaction of
ribavirin phosphorylation by  xxxg79xxx  is significantly
slower than that of adenosine (10).
in addition to the direct phosphorylation route catalyzed by
nucleoside kinases and related enzymes, alternative ribavirin
phosphorylation pathways have been explored. a nucleoside
could undergo phosphorolysis to nucleobase that is subsequently converted to nucleoside monophosphate by a phosphoribosyl transferase. although ribavirin can undergo phosphorolysis by purine  xxxg1792xxx , its triazole base
fails to convert to rmp by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (31).
like ribavirin, viramidine undergoes 5⬘-phosphorylation in
vivo (19). a metabolic profile analysis of orally dosed viramidine in animals showed that about 40% of viramidine exists in

the three 5⬘-phosphorylated forms. although these viramidine
5⬘-phosphates are not known to associate with any antiviral
activities, it is important to comprehend its metabolic mechanism. in this study, we investigated 5⬘-monophosphorylation of
ribavirin and viramidine by several nucleoside kinases and cytosolic 5⬘-nucleotidase ii ( xxxg1611xxx ) and determined their kinetic
parameters. the implications of this study for in vivo drug
activation and metabolic mechanism, especially ribavirin phosphate anabolism in rbcs, are discussed.
materials and methods
materials. [2,8-3h]inosine (30 ci/mmol) was purchased from amersham biosciences. [2,8-3h]adenosine (25 ci/mmol) was purchased from icn biomedicals.
[5-14c]ribavirin (54 mci/mmol) and [5-14c]viramidine (56 mci/mmol) were custom synthesized by moravek biochemicals (brea, ca). a purified recombinant
 xxxg79xxx  from cho cells was a gift from c. cameron at pennsylvania
state university. a human placental cdna library and pcr4blunt-topo vector
were obtained from invitrogen. 2,3-diphospho-d-glyceric acid tris salt (or 2,3bisphosphoglycerate; bpg) was purchased from sigma. various nucleosides and
nucleotides were from sigma or icn biochemicals. all other reagents were of
the highest grade available from sigma or fisher.
 xxxg79xxx  assay. a radiochemical-based thin-layer chromatography
(tlc) assay was developed to monitor 5⬘-phosphorylation of radiolabeled adenosine, ribavirin, or viramidine by  xxxg79xxx  with atp as a phosphate
donor. a typical assay was carried out at 37°c in 20 ␮l containing 1⫻ dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), ph 7.3, 1 mm atp, 1.5 mm mgcl2. the final
concentration of  xxxg79xxx  was 0.05, 2.5, or 5 ␮m, respectively, for assays
with [2,8-3h]adenosine, [5-14c]ribavirin, or [5-14c]viramidine as a substrate. in
some experiments, the pbs was adjusted to ph 9.0 or replaced by 100 mm
hepes, ph 7.3. an assay length was determined based on the activity of a
substrate. it lasted 4, 30, or 60 min, respectively, for adenosine, ribavirin, or
viramidine as a substrate. the reaction was quenched by addition of edta to
the final concentration of 80 mm. six microliters of the quenched mixture was
spotted on a silica gel 60 tlc plate (selecto scientific, ga). a tlc plate was
developed in a solvent system of ammonium:isopropanol:water (3:5:2). after air
dry and exposure to a phosphorimager overnight, products on the plate were
analyzed and quantified to calculate initial velocity. for steady-state kinetic
analysis, a substrate concentration was varied from 0.1 to 4 mm with atp fixed
at 1.0 mm. apparent kinetic parameters were calculated by applying a series of
initial velocity at different substrate concentrations into michaelis-menten equations using a nonlinear least-squares regression fit in kaleidagraph (synergy
software). all the experiments were repeated at least three times to assure that
reproducible results were obtained. the reported kinetic parameters are presented as mean ⫾ standard deviation.
cloning, expression, and purification of cytosolic 5ⴕ-nucleotidase ii. the  xxxg1611xxx 
gene was cloned from a human placenta cdna library using the published  xxxg1611xxx 
sequence information (genbank accession number nm_012229) (23). a forward primer of 5⬘-tacatatgtcgacctcctggagtg-3⬘ and a reverse antiparallel primer of 5⬘-cgaattcttattcttcctcctcctcc-3⬘ were used to
amplify the 1,686-bp open reading frame of the  xxxg1611xxx  gene. the pcr product
was cloned directly into a topo vector using the zero blunt topo pcr
cloning kit. the sequence of the  xxxg1611xxx  insert was confirmed by dna sequencing.
the insert was subsequently recloned to a pet22b(⫹) vector using a rapid dna
ligation kit (roche) and transformed with escherichia coli bl21(de3) cells.
fermentation for expression of recombinant  xxxg1611xxx  was carried out in terrific
broth at 30°c. the cell culture was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-␤-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when its optical density at 600 nm (od600) reached 1.5. cells were

the parameters were determined at 37°c in dulbecco’s pbs, ph 7.3, with atp concentration fixed at 1.0 mm, unless otherwise indicated.

harvested 3 h postinduction. the cell pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm tris, ph 7.5, 200 mm nacl, 2 mm 2- xxxd26xxx  in the presence
of a protease inhibitor cocktail. the suspension was passed through a microfluidizer to disrupt cells. the crude lysate was spun at 100,000 ⫻ g for 1 h to obtain
supernatant. recombinant  xxxg1611xxx  was purified to apparent homogeneity using
two chromatography steps. since  xxxg1611xxx  contains a stretch of acidic amino acid
residues at the c terminus which enables it to bind to nickel-chelating resin (29),
the supernatant was first loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-chelating column equilibrated
with the suspension buffer. the column was washed with a buffer of 20 mm tris,
ph 7.5, 200 mm nacl, 2 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , and 5 mm imidazole. when a
step gradient of imidazole concentration raised to 25 mm,  xxxg1611xxx  eluted from the
nickel column. the peak fractions containing  xxxg1611xxx  were pooled, and its nacl
concentration was adjusted to 50 mm through dilution. it was reloaded onto a
mono q column equilibrated with 20 mm tris, ph 7.5, 50 mm nacl, and 2 mm
dithiothreitol (dtt). proteins were eluted over a 1 m nacl gradient.  xxxg1611xxx 
eluted at 500 mm nacl with apparent homogeneity. the final protein yield was
about 1.2 mg per liter of culture.
phosphotransferase assay of  xxxg1611xxx . the phosphotransferase activity of  xxxg1611xxx 
was assayed using a similar radiochemical tlc assay described for adenosine
kinase except that imp was used as a phosphate donor. briefly, an assay was
performed at 37°c in 15 ␮l containing 20 mm tris, ph 7.4, 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm
dtt, 4 mm imp, and a radioactive nucleoside substrate. small molecular effector(s) was included as indicated. the final concentration of  xxxg1611xxx  was 20 nm
for all three substrates, [5-14c]ribavirin, [5-14c]viramidine, and [2,8-3h]inosine.
the assay lasted for 1 h. reaction products were analyzed by tlc and quantified
using a phosphorimager. the effects of atp, bpg, and dulbecco’s pbs on  xxxg1611xxx 
activity were investigated. in these studies, ribavirin concentration was fixed at
0.125 mm or viramidine at 0.5 mm with an effector’s concentration varied from
0 to 5 mm for atp and 0 to 1.6 mm for bpg. the bpg dependency of  xxxg1611xxx 
activity was found hyperbolic and fitted to michaelis-menten equation for calculating the apparent km for stimulation.
steady-state kinetic analysis of  xxxg1611xxx  in the presence of a single effector was
performed in  xxxd3449xxx  with imp concentration fixed at 4.0 mm as described
above. an activator concentration was set at optimum with atp at 2 mm or bpg
at 0.4 mm. the concentration of a nucleoside substrate was varied from km/2
to 500 ␮m for [5-14c]ribavirin and [5-14c]viramidine and km/2 to 10 mm for
[2,8-3h]inosine. the apparent kinetic parameters were determined from
michaelis-menten equations. likewise, the kinetic parameters for ribavirin phosphorylation were also determined in dulbecco’s pbs in the presence of 2 mm
atp with and without 3 mm bpg. all the experiments were repeated at least
three times to assure that reproducible results were obtained. the reported
kinetic parameters were presented as mean ⫾ standard deviation.

results
 xxxg79xxx  catalyzed 5ⴕ-phosphorylation. adenosine
kinase is an abundant and ubiquitous enzyme that regulates
extracellular adenosine and intracellular adenine nucleotide
concentrations (30). since it is widely accepted that adenosine
kinase is responsible for ribavirin 5⬘-monophosphorylation, we
obtained a recombinant mammalian  xxxg79xxx  and determined the kinetic parameters for the reaction. the  xxxg79xxx  is derived from cho cells, and it was expressed
and purified to homogeneity from e. coli. this  xxxg79xxx  shares approximately 92% amino acid sequence identity
with the human form (21). we characterized the purified enzyme using adenosine as a substrate. in pbs, ph 7.3, with atp

concentration fixed at 1.0 mm, the apparent km for adenosine
was 3.2 ␮m and kcat was 13 min⫺1. the catalytic efficiency
(kcat/km) of the reaction was 3.9 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 (table 1).
these are consistent with the published results for cho cellderived  xxxg79xxx  (21).
5⬘-phosphorylation of ribavirin by  xxxg79xxx  was initially investigated in a hepes buffer with atp fixed at 1 mm
as described in the literature (13). kinetic analysis was performed by determining initial velocity at various ribavirin concentrations. saturation of michaelis-menten plot was not
reached at the highest concentration of ribavirin used (4 mm)
(data not shown). from the available data, the apparent km for
ribavirin was estimated  xxxd2274xxx .8 mm and kcat at 0.62 min⫺1,
yielding a catalytic efficiency of 7.9 ⫻ 10⫺5 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1
(table 1). this catalytic efficiency is 50,000-fold lower than that
of adenosine. ribavirin phosphorylation was also investigated
in pbs. surprisingly, suppression of the enzyme activity in pbs
due to the presence of inorganic phosphate was not observed.
on the contrary, compared to hepes buffer, pbs actually
enhanced  xxxg79xxx ’s activity. further kinetic analysis
yielded an apparent km of 0.54 mm and a kcat of 1.8 min⫺1.
these represent a 14- and 3-fold improvement of the respective kinetic parameters to the hepes buffer. overall, the catalytic efficiency was increased by 42-fold after switching the
buffer from hepes to pbs (table 1). regardless, ribavirin is
still a poor substrate for  xxxg79xxx  with catalytic efficiency about 1,200-fold lower than that of adenosine. this
conclusion is qualitatively consistent with a previous report
that the velocity of ribavirin phosphorylation catalyzed by
cem-cell  xxxg79xxx  is 5 ⫻ 105-fold slower than that of
adenosine (10).
likewise, phosphorylation of viramidine by  xxxg79xxx  was evaluated. in pbs, ph 7.3, viramidine phosphorylation was much slower than that of ribavirin. kinetic analysis by
varying viramidine’s concentration from 0.1 to 4 mm with atp
fixed at 1 mm gave an estimated km of 16 mm and a kcat of
0.16 min⫺1. the resulting catalytic efficiency of 1.0 ⫻ 10⫺5
min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 is 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin and 3.9 ⫻
105-fold lower than that of adenosine (table 1). the structures
of ribavirin and viramidine are very similar (fig. 1). both
compounds mimic the conformation of adenosine. but at
physiological ph, viramidine possesses an additional positive charge on the 3-carboxamidine group. this charge has
been shown to interfere with substrate recognition in viramidine deamination reaction catalyzed by  xxxg62xxx 
(39). when the assay ph was changed from 7.3 to 9.0, viramidine lost some of the positive charge and became partially
deprotonated. as a result, the deamination rate was increased
by 300-fold. to find out whether this positive charge exerts a

similar effect on viramidine phosphorylation, we performed
 xxxg79xxx  assay in pbs with ph adjusted to 9.0. at ph
9.0, the phosphorylation reaction did accelerate. compared to
ph 7.3, the apparent km was declined by twofold to 7.7 mm
and kcat elevated to 0.26 min⫺1, resulting in a 3.4-fold improvement of catalytic efficiency (table 1). thus, deprotonation of
the 3-carboxamidine group improves viramidine’s reactivity,
but the effect is relatively small.
5ⴕ-phosphorylation by other nucleoside kinases. in light of
the lower activity of  xxxg79xxx  towards ribavirin and
viramidine, other nucleoside kinases were obtained and tested
for phosphorylation. we explored  xxxg611xxx , a nucleoside kinase notable for its broad substrate specificity, and
uridine-cytidine kinase, a major pyrimidine  xxxd2246xxx  kinase. however, no ribavirin or viramidine phosphorylation was
detected for either of the enzymes in our radiochemical assay
(data not shown).
 xxxg1611xxx  catalyzed phosphorylation. cytosolic 5⬘-nucleotidase
ii or  xxxg1611xxx  is a ubiquitous enzyme capable of catalyzing 5⬘monophosphorylation of many inosine and guanosine nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir,  xxxd1876xxx  (18), tiazofurin
(10), and carbocyclic 2⬘-deoxyguanosine (3). since ribavirin
also resembles the conformation of inosine (fig. 1),  xxxg1611xxx 
could potentially catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation. to test
this hypothesis, we cloned the human  xxxg1611xxx  gene from a human
placenta cdna library and put it into an expression vector.
the recombinant  xxxg1611xxx  was expressed in e. coli and purified to
homogeneity. the enzyme was fully active in both 5⬘-nucleotidase assay and nucleoside phosphotransferase assay (data not
shown).
to investigate ribavirin phosphorylation by  xxxg1611xxx , we initially adapted the published assay buffer of 20 mm tris, ph 7.4,
5 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm dtt with imp concentration fixed at
4 mm. in these conditions, ribavirin was phosphorylated by cnii (fig. 2). interestingly, the presence of atp or bpg drastically enhanced the activity. similarly, viramidine was tested for
phosphorylation by  xxxg1611xxx . like ribavirin, it was phosphorylated
by  xxxg1611xxx , albeit to a lesser degree (data not shown). the stimulation effect of atp on ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation was further examined by titrating atp from 0 to 5 mm

with ribavirin concentration fixed at 125 ␮m or viramidine at
500 ␮m. as shown in fig. 3a, the activation curves were bell
shaped, with the optimal atp concentration at 2 mm for both
ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation. the observed decrease of the stimulation effect at high atp concentration (⬎2
mm) was not caused by depletion of mgcl2, as elevated mgcl2
concentration up to 20 mm yielded a similar bell-shaped curve
(data not shown). further experiments are required to address
the potential inhibitory effect observed at high atp concentration. the optimal atp concentration (2 mm) is in good
agreement with reported value for inosine phosphorylation

fig. 3. effects of atp (a) and bpg (b) on 5⬘-phosphorylation of

at 125 ␮m or [5-14c]viramidine at 500 ␮m. the hyperbolic curve of
enzyme activity-bpg relationship was fitted to michaelis-menten
equations for calculating the apparent km of bpg for  xxxg1611xxx  activation.

the apparent kinetic parameters were determined at 37°c in either  xxxd3449xxx  or dulbecco’s pbs with imp concentration fixed at 4 mm.
the apparent kcat/km was estimated from the slope in the linear range of michaelis-menten plot.

(25). compared to the reaction without atp, 2 mm atp
enhanced the phosphotransferase activity by 17-fold for ribavirin and 10-fold for viramidine. the magnitude of activation
effect is a bit higher than reported for inosine phosphorylation,
which is 8.5-fold (25). the difference could be caused by the
distinct substrate, assay conditions, or enzyme source employed in these assays.
the stimulation effect of bpg on ribavirin and viramidine
phosphorylation was also assessed. for either substrate, titration of bpg against  xxxg1611xxx  activity displayed a hyperbolic relationship (fig. 3b). the km of bpg for stimulation was 75 and
58 ␮m for ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation, respectively. these km values are about 10-fold lower than reported
for inosine phosphorylation (25). notably, they are also lower
than bpg’s physiological concentration in rbcs. compared to
the reaction in the absence of bpg, the optimal bpg concentration elevated ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation by
eight- and fivefold, respectively. the magnitude of the stimulation effect is in good agreement with that reported for inosine
phosphorylation (25). moreover, the combination effect of
atp and bpg on  xxxg1611xxx  activity was examined by varying atp
concentration from 1 to 2 mm and bpg from 0.4 to 0.8 mm.
although significant activation effect was observed in all the
concentrations, the preliminary results shown in fig. 2 suggest
that combination of the two activators is likely to be antagonistic. this result implies that atp and bpg may act through
a similar mechanism and compete with each other.
kinetic analysis of  xxxg1611xxx  catalyzed 5ⴕ-phosphorylation. to
further comprehend ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation
by  xxxg1611xxx , we determined their steady-state kinetic parameters
in the presence of a single activator in  xxxd3449xxx  with imp
fixed at 4 mm. for comparison, we first determined the kinetic
parameters for [2,8-3h]inosine. in the presence of 2 mm atp,
its kcat was 1,300 min⫺1 and km was 2.2 mm, resulting in a
catalytic efficiency of 0.61 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 (table 2). in the
literature, the reported km for inosine ranges from 1.2 to 9 mm
(3, 18). our results are in good agreement with one of those
studies (25). similarly, the kinetics with inosine was determined in the presence of 0.4 mm bpg. in that condition, the
apparent kcat was 1,200 min⫺1 and km was 1.8 mm (table 2).
the resultant catalytic efficiency of 0.63 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 is similar to that with atp as an activator.
the steady-state kinetics of ribavirin phosphorylation by
 xxxg1611xxx  was determined in  xxxd3449xxx . as illustrated in fig. 4a,
in the presence of 2 mm of atp, the apparent km for ribavirin
was 95 ␮m and kcat was 9.4 min⫺1, yielding a catalytic efficiency

ribavirin and viramidine 5⬘-monophosphorylation

of 0.099 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 (table 2). when the activator was
changed to 0.4 mm bpg, the apparent km was reduced to 47
␮m and kcat declined to 1.6 min⫺1 (fig. 4b), resulting in a
threefold reduction of catalytic efficiency (0.035 min⫺1 ·
␮m⫺1) (table 2). likewise, the steady-state kinetics of viramidine phosphorylation by  xxxg1611xxx  was analyzed. as illustrated
in fig. 4, in the presence of either 2 mm atp or 0.4 mm bpg
as an activator, saturation of michaelis-menten plot was not
reached even when [5-14c]viramidine was at the highest concentration used (500 ␮m). we could not increase viramidine
concentration further due to its lower radioactive specific activity. judged from the available data, the km for viramidine is
much higher than 500 ␮m. although it is impossible to deduce
meaningful kcat and km from the data set, we estimated its
catalytic efficiency from the slope in the linear range of
michaelis-menten plot (fig. 4). it was 0.0062 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 in
the presence of 2 mm atp and 0.0025 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 with 0.4
mm bpg (table 2). clearly, viramidine phosphorylation by
 xxxg1611xxx  is about 10- to 15-fold slower than that of ribavirin.
to assess potential ribavirin phosphorylation by  xxxg1611xxx  in the
physiological conditions, we determined its kinetic parameters
in pbs plus 2 mm atp and 5 mm mgcl2, with and without 3
mm bpg. this assay system contains all the important  xxxg1611xxx 
effectors, including atp, bpg, mg2⫹, k⫹, and inorganic phosphate. bpg is a bisphosphorylated metabolite that acts as an
allosteric modulator for oxygen binding to hemoglobin in
rbcs (7). its concentration in mammalian rbcs is as high as
4 to 13 mm; however, its concentration in other tissues is at
least 2 to 3 magnitudes lower and can be neglected. to mimic
the physiological conditions in rbcs and other tissues, we
determined the kinetic parameters in the absence and presence of 3 mm bpg. as summarized in table 2, in the absence
of bpg, the apparent km for ribavirin was 24 ␮m and kcat was
1.4 min⫺1. compared to the reaction in  xxxd3449xxx , the presence of 9.3 mm inorganic phosphate, 2.7 mm kcl, and 140
mm nacl in pbs collectively contributes to a decrease of kcat
by 6.7-fold and km by 4-fold. overall, the resulting catalytic
efficiency of 0.058 min⫺1 · ␮m⫺1 is comparable to that in tris
buffer. these results indicate that switching buffer from tris to
pbs has no significant effect on ribavirin phosphorylation by
 xxxg1611xxx . further kinetic analysis was performed in the presence
of bpg. compared to the reaction without bpg, the presence
of 3 mm bpg increased kcat by 3-fold to 4.0 min⫺1 and km by
3.7-fold to 88 ␮m (table 2). these results confirm the assessment in the literature that bpg can enhance nucleoside phosphorylation rate in the physiological conditions when both
atp and inorganic phosphate are present. however, the presence of bpg does have a negative impact on substrate affinity,
yielding a similar catalytic efficiency in the absence and presence of 3 mm bpg. nevertheless, when ribavirin concentration is below the km value as in the plasma of treated hcv
patients, we anticipate a positive effect of bpg on ribavirin
phosphorylation.
discussion
our steady-state kinetic studies indicate that although  xxxg79xxx  can catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro, the
activity is unexpectedly low, with a km of 0.54 mm and a kcat of
1.8 min⫺1 in pbs. notably, the km value is much higher than

2169

ribavirin’s concentration in the plasma of treated hcv patients. these findings suggest ribavirin is not a good substrate
for  xxxg79xxx , which casts doubt whether ribavirin is
exclusively phosphorylated by  xxxg79xxx  in vivo. further analyses show that the lower catalytic efficiency is attributed by both poor substrate binding and slower catalysis, which
can be explained structurally. ribavirin’s triazole mimics adenine nucleobase (fig. 1); however, it misses the n1-c2-n3 segment of adenine. apparently, the missing molecular moiety is
critical for substrate recognition and efficient catalysis by  xxxg79xxx . the lack of these structural elements in ribavirin
culminates in a 1,200-fold decrease of reactivity.
viramidine phosphorylation by  xxxg79xxx  was detected in our radiochemical assay; however, its catalytic efficiency is 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin. the extremely
high km (16 mm) and low kcat (0.16 min⫺1) make viramidine
an unlikely substrate for  xxxg79xxx  in vivo. structurally,
viramidine should mimic adenosine better than ribavirin, as its
two nitrogen atoms in 3-carboxamidine could imitate both
6-amino and n1 nitrogen of adenosine (fig. 1). but our kinetic
analysis suggests otherwise. whereas the n1 atom in adenosine
is a hydrogen bond acceptor, the nitrogen atoms in the 3-carboxamidine moiety are positively charged and are a hydrogen
bond donor. the electronic property of 3-carboxamidine is
likely responsible for the lower viramidine phosphorylation by
 xxxg79xxx .
structurally related to ribavirin, tiazofurin is another purine
nucleoside analog with a five-membered ring nucleobase. it is
known to be phosphorylated by three enzymes, including  xxxg79xxx , nicotinamide  xxxd2246xxx  kinase, and a 5⬘nucleotidase (27).  xxxg1611xxx  is known as high-km 5⬘-nucleotidase
or gmp-imp-specific 5⬘-nucleotidase (4). it possesses both
5⬘-nucleotidase and nucleoside phosphotransferase activities.
depending on the availability of phosphate acceptors,  xxxg1611xxx 
catalyzes phosphotransfer from a  xxxd2705xxx  monophosphate, such as imp, to either a water molecule (5⬘-nucleotidase activity) or a  xxxd2705xxx  (phosphotransferase
activity) (25). although it has not been thoroughly characterized, the interplay of these two enzymatic activities is highly
influenced by the reaction ph as well as the presence of suitable nucleoside phosphate acceptors, nucleoside triphosphate
activators, and other small molecular effectors. studies showed
that ph 6.5 favors nucleotidase activity and ph 7.3 is optimal
for phosphotransferase activity (2). moreover,  xxxg1611xxx  activity is
very sensitive to the presence of atp, bpg, and potassium
salt, which are the known activators, and inorganic phosphate,
which is an inhibitor.
our studies indicate that like tiazofurin, ribavirin phosphorylation can be catalyzed by a 5⬘-nucleotidase,  xxxg1611xxx , with a
catalytic efficiency much better than that by  xxxg79xxx .
judged from the kinetic parameters obtained in pbs, its kcat is
2.2-fold higher (4.0 versus 1.8 min⫺1) and km is 6.1-fold lower
(88 versus 540 ␮m) (table 2). remarkably, in contrast to most
 xxxg1611xxx  substrates whose km values are in the millimolar range
(18), the km for ribavirin is in the micromolar range, suggesting
that the observed ribavirin phosphorylation by  xxxg1611xxx  may be
physiologically relevant. the concomitant 5⬘-nucleotidase activity of  xxxg1611xxx  should have little effect on ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo, as rmp is only an intermediate in conversion to

2170

wu et al.

rtp. rmp is not known to accumulate to a high concentration, and it should not be susceptible to  xxxg1611xxx ’s hydrolysis.
as phosphotransferase activity of  xxxg1611xxx  is highly influenced
by the presence of various small molecular effectors, we made
an effort to include most notable  xxxg1611xxx  effectors in our studies.
interestingly, the overall catalytic efficiency of ribavirin phosphorylation in  xxxd3449xxx  is comparable to that in pbs (table
2). in addition to phosphate donor imp and nucleotide activator atp included in our assays, other small molecular effectors, such as gmp, dgmp,  xxxd1148xxx , and gtp are significantly
present in vivo (25). they will certainly influence  xxxg1611xxx ’s activity for ribavirin phosphorylation. therefore, it is imperative
to conduct in vivo experiments to assess whether our in vitro
conclusions are plausible and determine how much each of
 xxxg1611xxx  and  xxxg79xxx  contributes to ribavirin phosphorylation. the catalytic efficiency values reported in this study
reflect the intrinsic catalytic power of  xxxg79xxx  and
 xxxg1611xxx  towards ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation. in
physiological conditions, the respective contribution of  xxxg1611xxx 
and  xxxg79xxx  for ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation is likely determined by the concentrations of individual
enzyme as well as various effectors present in vivo. our studies
do not exclude any other nucleoside kinase and related enzyme
that may be involved in ribavirin phosphorylation, nor do they
exclude the possibility of rmp formation from deamination of
vmp.
like ribavirin, viramidine can be phosphorylated by  xxxg1611xxx  in
vitro, albeit to a lesser degree. from our kinetic analysis, its
high km (⬎0.5 mm) would make it unlikely to be efficiently
phosphorylated by  xxxg1611xxx  in vivo. because of the lower activity
of both  xxxg79xxx  and  xxxg1611xxx  towards viramidine, it is
possible that other nucleoside kinases or related enzymes are
involved in its phosphorylation in vivo.
elucidation of ribavirin phosphorylation mechanism has important implications in understanding ribavirin metabolism in
vivo, especially in rbcs. notably, among the hcv patients
treated with ribavirin, significant numbers of them suffer from
hemolytic anemia due to ribavirin phosphate accumulation in
rbcs. the ribavirin phosphate concentration can reach a level
that is 60- to 100-fold higher than its plasma concentration
(14). the high-level ribavirin can deplete intracellular atp,
impair atp-dependent oxidative respiratory pathway, damage
rbc membrane integrity, and eventually cause hemolytic anemia (9). to date, the molecular mechanism behind the accumulation of ribavirin in rbcs is still unknown. studies showed
that ribavirin’s cellular uptake is facilitated by a nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive (es)-nucleoside transporter (17). this type of
transporter is ubiquitous in virtually all cell types. therefore,
ribavirin should have no preference to be transported into a
particular cell type. as a neutral molecule, it should come in
and out of a cell rather easily. however, once it is phosphorylated, because of possession of negative charges, ribavirin
phosphates will be trapped inside cells. it is intriguing that
ribavirin only amasses to a high level in rbcs, which has to do
with its unusual metabolic kinetics occurring there. in theory,
a fast anabolism and/or slow catabolism of rtp would cause
the accumulation observed in rbcs. one study on ribavirin
metabolism reported that the rtp anabolic rate in rbcs is
slightly faster than that of skin fibroblast cells and is much
faster than that of lymphoblast cells. more importantly, the

antimicrob. agents chemother.

catabolic rate of rtp is a lot slower in rbcs than in either of
the nucleated cell lines, resulting in a very long half-time of
rtp in rbcs (24). if it turns out to be true in vivo, the slow
dephosphorylation of rtp or the lack of rtp-specific nucleotidase and/or phosphatase should play a key role in accumulating rtp. on the other hand, the relatively fast anabolic rate
in rbcs should also contribute to the accumulation. our studies reveal that  xxxg1611xxx  is able to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. coincidently,  xxxg1611xxx  is activated by bpg, a
bisphosphate metabolite that only amasses to a high concentration in rbcs. it has been described that a high concentration of bpg can maximally stimulate  xxxg1611xxx ’s activity and renders it almost insensitive to physiological concentrations of
atp and inorganic phosphate (5). our kinetic analysis supports bpg being a partial stimulator for ribavirin phosphorylation in the presence of atp and inorganic phosphate. although it is hard to predict the exact role of bpg in ribavirin
phosphorylation based on in vitro kinetic analysis, it is possible
that bpg is a major stimulator for  xxxg1611xxx  to drive the fast
anabolism of rtp in rbcs that contributes to hemolytic anemia in ribavirin-treated patients.
