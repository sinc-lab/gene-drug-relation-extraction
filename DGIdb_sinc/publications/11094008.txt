tetrodotoxin (ttx)-sensitive na⫹ channels in the peripheral nervous system are the major targets for local
anesthetics. in the peripheral nociceptive system, a na⫹
channel subtype resistant to ttx and with distinct electrophysiological properties seems to be of importance
for impulse generation and conduction. a current
through ttx-resistant na⫹ channels displays slower
activation and inactivation kinetics and has an increased activation threshold compared with ttxsensitive na⫹ currents and may have different pharmacological properties. we studied the effects of
stereoisomers of piperidine local anesthetics on neuronal ttx-resistant na⫹ currents recorded with the
whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp method in
enzymatically dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons

p

iperidine local anesthetics, such as mepivacaine,
ropivacaine, and  xxxd383xxx  are widely used in
clinical practice. these amide-linked drugs share
a common basic structure, differing only in the length
of the alkyl chain attached to the tertiary amine in
molecule, and because of a chiral carbon in the piperidine ring, they exist as stereoisomers or enantiomers
(fig. 1). despite similar nerve blocking potencies, the
s(⫺)-forms of ropivacaine and  xxxd383xxx  have distinct advantages over the r(⫹)-forms or the racemic
mixtures. this is mainly because of the decreased
cardiovascular and central nervous system side effects
of the s(⫺)-enantiomers (1) resulting in an increased
therapeutic index. because of these advantages, ropivacaine has only been introduced into clinical practice
as the s(⫺)-enantiomer, and  xxxd383xxx , used as the
racemic mixture of both enantiomers, will soon be
supported, in part, by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft,
grant vo188/13 to wv and by the förderkreis anästhesie e.v.

of adult rats. stereoisomers of mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and  xxxd383xxx  reversibly inhibited ttxresistant na⫹ currents in a concentration and usedependent manner. all drugs accelerated time course
of inactivation. half-maximal blocking concentrations
were determined from concentration-inhibition relationships. potencies for tonic and for use-dependent
block increased with rising lipid solubilities of the
drugs. stereoselective action was not observed. we conclude that block of ttx-resistant na⫹ currents may
lead to blockade of ttx-resistant action potentials in
nociceptive fibers and consequently may be responsible for pain suppression during local anesthesia.

the local anesthetic action of these drugs is achieved
by na⫹ channel blockade in the peripheral nervous
system.
na⫹ channels are integral membrane proteins responsible for the initiation of action potentials in many
excitable tissues. in the peripheral nervous system,
expeditious opening of voltage-gated na⫹ channels
combined with the passive electrical properties of myelinated axons allow high conduction velocities as
necessary for adequate interaction of the individual
with its environment. in the peripheral nociceptive
system, a distinct na⫹ channel subtype resistant to the
classical neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (ttx) is found,
which is to some extent involved in action potential
conduction along the axon (2) and in impulse initiation in peripheral nerve endings of nociceptors (3).
compound action potentials in c-fibers are partly
resistant to ttx, but depend on extracellular na⫹
ions. this was demonstrated by using various preparations of different species including human sural
nerves (2) and demonstrates the important role of
ttx-resistant na⫹ channels in conduction of nociceptive impulses. it further underlines the importance of
blocking these channels during local anesthesia, which

structural elements of local anesthetics can be identified, i.e., aromatic ring on the left, amide bond in the middle, and the tertiary
amine in the piperidine ring on the right. the asterisk marks the
chiral carbon of the structure. the alkyl chain (r) attached to the
nitrogen (n) of the piperidine ring determines the lipid solubility of

leads to blockade of ttx-resistant action potentials in
nociceptive fibers and consequently to pain suppression during local anesthesia. ttx-resistant na⫹ channels have also been cloned from human dorsal root
ganglia (drg)-neurons, which makes them putative
targets for pain therapy in humans (4).
because of its role in nociception, inhibition of neuronal ttx-resistant na⫹ currents is relevant for blocking
pain perception during local anesthesia. therefore, we
studied the blockade of neuronal ttx-resistant na⫹ currents by stereoisomers of the piperidine local anesthetics,
mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and  xxxd383xxx .

methods
adult wistar rats (200 –300 g) were used for preparing
the primary drg-cell culture used in this work. animals were killed by concussion and immediate cervical dislocation. the procedure was approved by the
local veterinarian authority. dorsal root ganglia were
removed from the full length of the vertebral column
and placed in calcium and magnesium-free phosphate
buffered saline. after cleaning the ganglia from connective tissue, they were incubated for 30 min at 37°c
in 2 mg/ml collagenase worthington type cls ii
(biochrom, berlin, germany) and 2 mg/ml trypsin
type iii-s (sigma, deisenhofen, germany) dissolved in
phosphate buffered saline, in a shaking water bath.
afterward, the ganglia were washed three times with
plating medium (described below) and transferred
into 80 ␮g/ml dnase, type iv and 100 ␮g/ml  xxxd207xxx , type i-s. fire-polished pipettes with decreasing diameter were then used for mechanically
dissociating the cells. after this procedure, the cells
were plated out in 35 mm culture dishes and stored in
plating medium under 95% o2 and 5% co2 at room
temperature until the experiment. cells were used for
the experiments 24 –72 h after preparation. significant
changes in na⫹ current properties, i.e., amplitude and
time course of the currents, were not detected during
this time period.

anesth analg
2000;91:1499 –1505

ttx-resistant na⫹ currents were recorded by using
the whole-cell patch clamp method. a culture dish
containing the cells was placed on the stage of an
inverted microscope and the plating medium was
changed to low na⫹ tyrode. experiments were conducted at 22°c.
patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillaries
(type ceebee 101-ps, chr. bardram, svendborg,
denmark) by using a flaming/brown micropuller
(sutter instrument company, science products
gmbh, hofheim, germany). the pipettes were fire
polished before use and, when filled with internal
solution, had a resistance of 0.8 to 1.2 m⍀.
current recordings were made by an axopatch
200b patch clamp amplifier (axon instruments, burlingame, ca) in the voltage-clamp mode. analog data
were filtered at 5 khz, digitized at 20 khz by using a
12-bit ad-converter (labmaster tm-40 ad/da
board, scientific solutions, solon, oh), and stored on
the hard disk of a personal computer, which also
served as the stimulus generator. all experiments
were conducted with capacitance and series resistance
compensation (60% to 70%). leakage current correction was performed electronically with the patch
clamp amplifier. pclamp 6.0 software (axon instruments) was used for acquisition and analysis of
currents.
low na⫹ tyrode used for the bath and control
solution contained: 35 mm nacl, 110 mm cholinechloride, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 6 mm
glucose, and 10 mm hepes. the ph was adjusted to
7.4 with tetraethylammoniumhydroxide. we added
100 nm ttx to suppress ttx-sensitive na⫹ currents
and 20 mm tetraethylammonium-chloride to block k⫹
currents. the low na⫹ concentration was necessary to
reduce the magnitude of na⫹ currents to improve
voltage-clamp conditions.
the internal solution, csfi, contained: 140 mm csf,
10 mm nacl, 3 mm egta, and 10 mm hepes. the
ph was adjusted to 7.2 with csoh. internal cesium
fluoride was used to suppress potassium and calcium
currents.
plating medium was freshly made of 26 ml minimum essential medium, 3 ml fetal calf serum, 1000 iu
penicillin, 1 mg streptomycin, and 0.6 ml l-glutamine
(200 mm). all chemicals were obtained from sigma,
deisenhofen, germany. local anesthetics were provided by astra pain control, södertälje, sweden.
solution exchanges were performed with a
multiple-barrel perfusion system. the barrels of the
perfusion system were directly connected to syringes
containing the control and test solutions. the syringes
were constantly driven by a perfusion pump, giving a
steady solution flow of 5 ml/h corresponding to a
flow speed of 40 mm/min in each barrel. after formation of the whole-cell configuration, the cell was lifted
up, still attached to the pipette tip and placed into the

barrel containing the desired solution. the seal quality, as well as the signal/noise ratio, were not influenced by this procedure; solution exchanges were
completed in ⬍1 s.
current-voltage relationships (i/e) were constructed by plotting the peak na⫹ current (ina), elicited by 50 ms depolarizing pulses to different test
potentials (et), after a 50 ms hyperpolarizing prepulse
to ⫺110 mv, against et. the variables describing the
i/e relationship were evaluated by fitting the modified boltzmann function

to the data points, where gna,max is the maximal possible na⫹ conductance, e50,a is the half-maximal activation potential, ka is the slope factor of the activation
curve, and erev is the reversal potential of the current.
to determine blocking potencies for tonic and usedependent block, concentration-inhibition curves
were constructed from peak current inhibition by the
drugs. for this, na⫹ currents were elicited by a 50-ms
depolarizing pulse to ⫺10 mv, preceded by a 50-ms
hyperpolarizing prepulse to ⫺110 mv. the impulse
protocol was applied in a train of 10 at a frequency of
2 hz once in control solution, in different local anesthetic concentrations, and again in control solution to
check reversibility. fractional inhibition of the current
was measured by dividing the peak current in the
presence of drug by the peak current in the previous
control solution during the first (tonic inhibition) and
10th pulse (use-dependent inhibition) of the train.
plotting fractional inhibition (fi) against local anesthetic concentration (c) gave concentration-inhibition
relationships for each drug for tonic and usedependent (2 hz) block. nonlinear least-squares fitting of

results
in the absence of ttx, na⫹ currents recorded from
small and medium size (20 –35 ␮m diameter) drgcells often had a mixture of varying proportions of fast
and slow currents. adding 100 nm ttx to the control

1501

solution completely blocked the fast na⫹ current component, permitting the isolated investigation of the
slow ttx-resistant na⫹ current. in large neurons
(⬎50 ␮m diameter), fast ttx-sensitive currents dominated, being the only na⫹ current component in some
cells. traces of the fast ttx-sensitive na⫹ current at
various test potentials in a large cell without ttx are
shown in fig 2, a; and traces of the slow ttx-resistant
current in a small cell after adding 100 nm ttx are
shown in fig 2, b. plotting the peak current against
test potential gave i/e-relationships of the currents,
which were fitted with equation 1 (fig. 2 a and b).
to solely investigate ttx-resistant currents, further
investigations were conducted only on small and medium size drg-neurons (20 –35 ␮m) in the presence of
100 nm ttx. stereoisomers of the piperidine local
anesthetics mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and  xxxd383xxx  reversibly blocked ttx-resistant na⫹ currents in
a concentration-dependent manner at infrequent stimulation. block at low frequency stimulation is defined
tonic block and mainly represents the affinity of the
local anesthetic to na⫹ channels in the resting state. at
higher stimulation frequencies (2 hz) use-dependent
block was also observed. as known from ttxsensitive na⫹ currents, this blocking phenomenon results from higher affinities of the local anesthetic to
channel states populated during depolarization (5,6).
fig. 3, a shows examples of ttx-resistant na⫹ currents recorded in control solution and in 30 ␮m drug
at a stimulus rate of 2 hz. all drugs reduce the peak
ttx-resistant na⫹ current. a stimulation of 2 hz further reduces the current in an use-dependent manner.
the drugs also induce a more rapid inactivation time
course of the current trace. fig. 3, b demonstrates the
inhibition of the peak current by 30 ␮m drug at each
pulse in the train as obtained from the current traces in
fig. 3, a.
concentration-inhibition curves were evaluated
from fractional peak current inhibition (fig. 4). fitting
equation 2 to the concentration-inhibition curves resulted in hill coefficients (h) close to unity for all local
anesthetics investigated. for this reason, we refitted all
data with a fixed hill coefficient of one, accounting for
a 1:1 blocking stoichiometry, i.e., one blocker molecule
suffices to block one na⫹ channel. ic50 values are
listed in table 1. comparing the potencies (ic50) of the
drugs reveals that mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and  xxxd383xxx  showed no remarkable stereoselectivity in
inhibiting ttx-resistant na⫹ currents, with mepivacaine displaying the highest stereoselectivity factor
r(⫺)/s(⫹) of 1.4 for tonic and 1.3 for use-dependent
block. furthermore, our experiments show that potencies for tonic and use-dependent block mainly depend
on the length of the alkyl chain attached to the amine
in the piperidine ring and on lipid solubilities of the
drugs. fig 5 depicts the dependence of the ic50 values
on the alkyl chain length. to demonstrate that potency

half-maximal blocking concentrations (ic50) were obtained by fitting equation 2 (h fixed to one) to concentration-inhibition curves evaluated from fractional
current inhibition of the first (tonic inhibition, ic50,ton) and tenth pulse (use-dependent inhibition, ic50,udb) of the 2 hz train. numbers are fitted values ⫾ standard
error of the fit which represents the 95% confidence interval. partition coefficients (log p) for mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and  xxxd383xxx  were derived from
strichartz et al. (24) and represent those of the racemic mixture at 25°c. log p values for 1-pentyl- and 1-octyl-2,6-methyl-pipecoloxylidide have been calculated
using the fragment method developed by hansch and leo (25).

1-pentyl-2,6-methyl-pipecoloxylidide (rad393) and 1-octyl-2,6methyl-pipecoloxylidide only the racemic mixtures were available.

were ⫺0.97 and ⫺0.22 for tonic and ⫺0.98 and ⫺0.34 for usedependent block, respectively.

(7). besides these thorough investigations, mostly performed on neuronal ttx-sensitive na⫹ currents or
ttx-insensitive na⫹ currents in the heart, it has been
demonstrated that neuronal ttx-resistant na⫹ currents have similar sensitivities to clinically used local
anesthetics (8).
unfortunately, na⫹ channels in nociceptive fibers
cannot be investigated directly. however, in the somata
of these fibers, channels are synthesized and incorporated into its membrane where they can be easily
investigated with the patch clamp method. current
through neuronal ttx-resistant na⫹ channels as measured in small and medium size drg neurons has

slower activation and inactivation kinetics, an increased activation threshold, and faster repriming kinetics (9) compared with ttx-sensitive na⫹ currents.
on the molecular level, it has become apparent that at
least two distinct na⫹ channels contribute to the ttxresistant current in rat drg neurons as shown by
whole-cell experiments, single channel analysis (10),
and cloning experiments (11). we did not discriminate
between ttx-resistant channel subtypes, which are
both important in nociceptive fibers of the peripheral
nervous system (11). in fact, we do think that both
channel types contribute to the ttx-resistant current
we have measured. this is apparent from the voltagedependent activation variables of the ttx-resistant
current. the ⫺21 mv we have measured as the halfmaximal activation potential for the ttx-resistant current lies between those for the sns/ xxxg2018xxx  and  xxxg2019xxx /
nan na⫹ channel subtype (11).
we investigated the effects of piperidine local anesthetics on ttx-resistant na⫹ currents in small dorsal
root ganglia neurons with respect to lipid solubility
and to stereospecificity. the major findings are that
the drugs produce state-dependent block; potency for
tonic and use-dependent block increases with the
length of the alkyl side chain of the drug, i.e., lipid
solubility; and there is no significant stereoselectivity
of current inhibition by mepivacaine, ropivacaine, or
 xxxd383xxx .
local anesthetics produce state-dependent block. at
least three major conformational states of the na⫹
channel exist, i.e., resting, open, and inactivated. on
short depolarization, the channel transits from the
resting into the open state and subsequently, within a
few milliseconds, into the inactivated state. prolonged
depolarizations put all types of voltage-gated na⫹
channels into an additional slow inactivated state, the
recovery from which, lies in the range of seconds.
use-dependent block of na⫹ channels and leftward
shift of availability curves are well known features of

1504

regional anesthesia and pain medicine bräu et al.
local anesthetics block tetrodotoxin-r na⫹ channels

local anesthetics and are thought to result from statedependent block, i.e., different channel states exhibit
different affinities to the local anesthetic, as described
by the modulated (5,6) or guarded (12) receptor hypothesis. in our experiments with ttx-resistant na⫹
currents, a decreased inactivation time constant was
observed in all drugs. this may either result from an
increased rate from the open into the inactivated state
of the channel, or from open channel block under the
drug. in both cases, higher affinities of the drugs to
channel states induced by depolarization may account
for the observed phenomenon responsible for usedependent block.
ragsdale et al (13) could identify a putative local
anesthetic receptor in rat brain iia channels as two
hydrophobic amino-acids residing in the iv-s6 segment of the ␣-subunit. because the cloned neuronal
ttx-resistant na⫹ channel, sns/ xxxg2018xxx , and  xxxg2019xxx /
nan have identical amino acids at corresponding positions, blockade via this specific receptor is also likely
for these channels. assuming that local anesthetics
bind to these hydrophobic amino-acids in the channel
pore, increased hydrophobicity of the alkyl moiety
may lead via a tighter binding, i.e., increased affinity,
to an increased potency of the drug. because of the
state-dependent higher affinity to the receptor, drugs
with longer chains will stay longer at this receptor
between stimuli (14 –16), which may explain their enhanced use-dependent blocking ability at equal stimulating frequencies as observed in our experiments
(fig. 5). however, we cannot distinguish whether the
overall lipophilicity of the drug molecule or the length
of the alkyl side chain itself is relevant for the increased blocking potency.
stereoselectivity is often regarded as evidence that a
particular drug acts at a specific binding site. however, we cannot turn this around and say if there is no
stereoselectivity, there is no specific receptor. the
structural elements differing in the two stereoisomers
may not be responsible for binding to the receptor.
potencies of the investigated drugs correlate with
their lipid solubilities. lengthening the alkyl chain
from ch3 to c8h17 results in a 3000-fold increase of
lipid solubility (partition coefficient) and leads to a
37-fold increase of potencies for tonic block and 245fold for use-dependent block. in other preparations,
similar results were obtained: tonic and usedependent inhibition of compound action potentials
of a, b, and c-fibers in rabbit vagal nerves depend on
lipid solubilities of the drugs (17). likewise, tonic and
use-dependent blockade of ttx-sensitive na⫹ channels by amide local anesthetics correlates also with
their lipid solubilities in peripheral nerve preparations
(18,19).
inhibition of the ttx-resistant na⫹ current by piperidine local anesthetics is not stereoselective, neither
for tonic nor for use-dependent block. the highest

anesth analg
2000;91:1499 –1505

stereoselectivity factor was 1.4 for s(⫹)-mepivacaine
over the r(⫺)-form for tonic block. neuronal ttxsensitive na⫹ channels also show low stereoselectivity
to piperidine local anesthetics. tonic inhibition of na⫹
currents in gh3 cells displayed a stereoselectivity factor of 1.6 for r(⫹)- over s(⫺)- xxxd383xxx  at ⫺70 mv
resting potential, which reversed to 0.8 when hyperpolarizing the membrane to ⫺100 mv (20). cardiac
na⫹ currents displayed no stereoselectivity in the resting state, but had a 1.7-fold stereopotency ratio for
r(⫹)- over s(⫺)- xxxd383xxx  in the inactivated state
(21), which may account for stereospecificity of cardiotoxicity. depression of compound action potentials
by  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers is also not very stereoselective. in rabbit vagal nerves, no stereospecific difference has been observed (1). in vivo studies have demonstrated that local anesthetic potencies are similar for
both  xxxd383xxx  enantiomers (1). the low stereoselectivity found in experimental studies is also observed for  xxxd383xxx  nerve block in clinical practice.
compared with racemic  xxxd383xxx , the s(⫺) xxxd383xxx  has similar local anesthetic actions and no
significant differences in nerve block are observed
during epidural anesthesia (22) and brachial plexus
blockade (23).
we wish to thank dr. rune sandberg of astra pain control, södertälje, sweden, for providing us piperidine-enantiomers and dr.
