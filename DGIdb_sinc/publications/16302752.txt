two methods for the determination of dichlorvos in durum wheat by electrochemical assay and gas
chromatography, respectively, have been developed. dichlorvos, an organophosphorus anticholinesterase pesticide, was extracted from wheat with hexane, and the filtered extract was directly
analyzed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus flame detection (npd). recoveries of
dichlorvos from milled wheat spiked at 0.25-1.5 µg/g ranged from 96.5 to 100.9%, and the limit of
detection was 0.02 µg/g. the electrochemical assay was based on the detection of choline, the
acetylcholinesterase product, via a choline oxidase biosensor. an aliquot of the filtered hexane extract
was partitioned with phosphate buffer solution, and the organic layer was evaporated prior to
electrochemical analysis. a limit of detection of 0.05 µg/g of dichlorvos was obtained with mean
recoveries of 97-103% at spiking levels of 0.25-1.5 µg/g. a good correlation (r ) 0.9919) was found
between the results obtained with the electrochemical and those obtained with the gas chromatographic methods. the electrochemical method was peer-validated in two laboratories that analyzed
10 blind samples (5 duplicates), including a blank and 4 spiked samples with dichlorvos at levels of
0.25, 0.60, 1.00, and 1.50 µg/g. within-laboratory repeatability (rsdr) and between-laboratory
reproducibility (rsdr) ranged from 5.5 to 7.8% and from 9.9 to 17.6%, respectively.

introduction

organophosphorus compounds (op) are substances widely
used in agricultural practices as pesticides having low environmental persistence and high efficacy. these compounds act by
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (ache) activity, resulting in
accumulation of acetylcholine (ach) at cholinergic receptor
sites, thereby excessively stimulating the cholinergic receptors
in both insects and mammals, including humans (1). this can
lead to various clinical implications and high acute toxicity (2).
dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate) is one of
the most widely used pesticides worldwide in the storage of
agricultural products such as corn, rice, and durum wheat,
finding widespread use in most european countries (3). european union regulation foresees a maximum residue limit (mrl)
for dichlorvos in durum wheat at 2.0 µg/g (4). dichlorvos, apart
from affecting the central nervous system (cns) by inhibiting
ache, is also classified as a probable human carcinogen on
the basis of the effects observed in mice and rats. therefore,
the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) proposed

cancellation of most uses of the dichlorvos pesticide and
proposed restrictions on retained uses. in particular, because of
dietary cancer risk, the epa proposed canceling uses of
dichlorvos in processed agricultural commodities that are stored
in bulk, packages, or bags including durum wheat and its
derivates such as flour and pasta (5).
sensitive, rapid, and reliable determination of dichlorvos in
environmental samples is therefore important for protecting the
environment and human health. gas chromatographic (gc)
procedures are currently used as reference methods for the
determination of dichlorvos in air, vegetables, water, soil, and
wastes and in a variety of foods (6-9). most of them are
multiresidue methods and have been validated with collaborative
studies on several matrices excluding wheat. the determination
of dichlorvos in durum wheat by gc-nitrogen-phosphorus
flame detection (npd) has been reported by crisp and tarrant,
who used methanol as extraction solvent and cleanup on a
charcoal column (10).
despite their very good sensitivity and reliability, these
methods are time-consuming and above all require expensive
instrumentation and have to be performed by highly trained
personnel.
biochemical sensors could be a reliable and promising
alternative to conventional methods because of their simplicity,
ease of use, and acceptable sensitivity and selectivity. recently,

many studies have focused on the development of low-cost
screen-printed electrode biosensors, which are well suited for
mass production and portable devices (11). this kind of
biosensor can be applied to the determination of pesticide
inhibition on ache coupled with the electrochemical determination of the enzyme product (12-22). in recent years an
important achievement in ache biosensor development has
been the use of recombinant enzymes to design more sensitive
and selective biosensors, but they are not commercially available
(23-29).
matrix limitation and troubles affecting the accuracy of results
have been reported for the application of ache inhibition assays
to pesticide detection; therefore, a multistep preparation of
samples is required to reduce these problems (30, 31).
more recently, an acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay for
the detection of dichlorvos in durum wheat has been developed.
the calculated limit of detection (lod) with commercial ache
was 0.45 µg/g, and the average recovery of dichlorvos from
samples spiked at 2.0 µg/g was 75%. however, the method was
applicable only to whole grain kernels, leading to possible
nonhomogeneous testing samples (32). the homogeneity of test
sample before analysis is important to obtain reliable analytical
results; therefore, accurate grinding of samples is crucial.
in the present paper we report a method using a choline
oxidase amperometric biosensor (screen-printed electrode) as
measuring device for quantitative determination of dichlorvos
in samples of ground wheat with contamination levels below
the european regulatory limit. the method was peer validated
by two laboratories to establish the accuracy, within-laboratory
repeatability, and between-laboratory reproducibility characteristics. the biosensor results were compared with those obtained
with a rapid gc-npd method that was also developed within
the present study.
materials and methods
reagents and apparatus. hexane and acetone were purchased from
j. t. baker. ache ( xxxg38xxx ) was obtained from electric eel (type
iv v-s, 970 units/ml) and choline oxidase from alcaligenes sp. (ec
1.1.3.17). all other reagents were obtained from sigma-aldrich (milan,
italy) and used without further purification. dichlorvos was purchased
from dr. ehrenstorfer gmbh (augsburg, germany). all aqueous
solutions were prepared using milli-q-treated water (milan, italy). a
mill, model mli-204 buehler (milan, italy), was used to grind (<1
mm particle size) durum wheat samples.
electrochemical experiments were carried out using a palmsens
hand-held potentiostat equipped with palmsens pc software for the
elaboration of current data (palmsens, amsterdam, the netherlands).
the cell consisted of a circular graphite working electrode, a silver
pseudo-reference electrode, and a graphite counter electrode. the cell
was printed on a planar polyester substrate. these screen-printed
electrodes (spe) were produced by palmsens.
a varian model cp3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a varian
model 8200 autosampler and a nitrogen-phosphorus flame detector
(npd) (varian, turin, italy), was used for gc analyses. the gc column
was a crossbond 5% diphenyl 95% dimethyl polysiloxane capillary
column (30 m × 0.32 i.d. mm × 0.25 µm) with an rtx-5w/integra
guard column (restek corp., bellefonte, pa). chromatographic data
were elaborated with the star chromatography workstation software,
version 5.51 (varian).
spiking and calibrant solutions. for electrochemical detection,
four dichlorvos spiking solutions (12.5, 30, 50, and 75 µg/ml) for
recovery experiments and five working calibrant solutions (0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 µg/ml) for method validation were prepared by
appropriately diluting with hexane aliquots of a dichlorvos stock
solution. the latter was prepared by dissolving in hexane 11.1 mg of
dichlorvos in a volumetric flask that was then made up to a final volume
of 10.0 ml and was kept at 4 °c. a matrix-assisted calibration curve

longobardi et al.
was obtained from working calibrant solutions. in particular, 25 µl of
each working calibrant solution was added to 200 µl of blank wheat
extract (hexane). after the addition of 100 µl of phosphate buffer
solution (pbs), hexane evaporation, and subsequent addition of ache
solution (75 µl) and ach solution (75 µl, see below), the concentrations of dichlorvos in pbs solutions were 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, and
0.80 µg/ml. a matrix-assisted calibration curve for gc analysis was
obtained from the same stock solution by adding the relevant dichlorvos
aliquots (four points) to blank wheat extract (hexane) in order to cover
the range 0.05-1.00 µg/ml.
extraction. a test portion size of 10 g of ground durum wheat
sample was extracted with 20 ml of hexane in a 100 ml flask by
shaking for 30 min with a model 711 vdrl orbital shaker (asal, milan,
italy). subsequently, the supernatant was filtered through whatman
no. 4 filter paper (whatman international ltd., maidstone, u.k.), and
10 ml of filtrate was collected and used either directly for gc analysis
or after cleanup for electrochemical bioassay.
gas chromatographic analysis. one microliter of sample extract
(equivalent to 0.5 mg of matrix) was injected in splitless mode at 250
°c. the oven temperature was as follows: 2 min at 70 °c, raised from
70 to 170 °c at 27 °c/min, and finally 5 min at 170 °c. the carrier
gas was he at a pressure of 14.6 psi. the temperature of the npd
detector was held at 300 °c. quantification was performed by measuring
the dichlorvos peak area and comparing it with the matrix-assisted
calibration curve (see above).
sample preparation for electrochemical bioassay. an aliquot (200
µl) of the filtered extract was transferred to a 2 ml micro-test tube
(eppendorf), and 25 µl of hexane and 100 µl of a 50 mm phosphate
buffer solution (ph 7.4), kcl 100 mmol/l (pbs), were added and then
mixed by vortex for 1 min. the mixture was allowed to separate into
two layers. the test tube was placed into a pierce reach-therm heating
module (pierce, rockford, il) set at 50 °c, and the upper organic layer
(hexane) was removed by evaporation. finally, the remaining extract
in pbs was mixed by vortex for 1 min and then analyzed by
electrochemical bioassay.
biosensor preparation. the choline oxidase biosensor was constructed using disposable screen-printed electrodes as reported by del
carlo et al. (23) and ricci et al. (34). in particular, the working electrode
was modified with prussian blue catalyst and with the biorecognition
element (choline oxidase). prussian blue modification of the screenprinted electrode was made by in loco addition of a mixture of
potassium ferricyanide [k3fe(cn)6] and ferric chloride (fecl3) in 0.01
mol/l hcl. choline oxidase was immobilized on the surface of the
prussian blue screen-printed electrode with the cross-linking method
using a mixture of glutaraldehyde, nafion, and bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(34).
inhibition assay. the inhibitory effect of dichlorvos on ache was
evaluated by comparing the decrease of the current intensity produced
by the reduction of the prussian blue electrochemical mediator.
the biochemical-electrochemical pathway used to determine the
inhibition consisted of two enzymatic reactions (eqs 1 and 2) generating
a chemical oxidation (eq 3) that was determined by cathodic chronoamperometry (eq 4).

both standard and sample extract solutions were analyzed according
to the following experimental scheme: first, the current intensity of a
blank sample extract was measured, and then the current intensity of
either the standard or the sample extract was measured. the current
intensity of the blank sample (i0) and of the contaminated sample or
standard solution (ii) was used to calculate the percent inhibition
according to the following formula:

i (%) ) 100 × (i0 - ii)/i0

determination of dichlorvos in wheat
the assay consisted in the addition of 75 µl of a ache solution (0.42
unit/ml in pbs) to 100 µl of the sample extract in pbs solution. the
incubation was allowed to proceed for 10 min, and thereafter an aliquot
of 75 µl of a 1.0 mm ach solution in pbs was added; after 2 min,
100 µl of this solution was placed on the biosensor surface and the
steady-state current recorded for 2 min. the total time of the
electrochemical assay was 15 min. the final concentrations of ache
and ach in solution were 0.125 unit/ml and 0.3 mm, respectively.
the biosensor was previously polarized in pbs at -50 mv versus
ag/agcl pseudo-reference electrode. after each measurement, the
biosensor surface was rinsed with pbs. a calibration curve was
obtained in the range of 0.05-0.80 µg/ml. the highest point of the
calibration curve corresponded to 2.0 µg/g of dichlorvos in wheat, that
is, the mrl established in the european union. using this experimental
protocol, the amount of matrix loaded on the working electrode was
40 mg. for quantitative analysis of samples contaminated at levels close
to or higher than 2.0 µg/g, a 3-fold-diluted extract was used, and
quantification was performed on the basis of a new calibration curve
using a 3-fold-diluted matrix extract.
validation of the electrochemical biosensor method. the electrochemical method was validated in two laboratories according to the
aoac guidelines for peer-verified method program (33). the two
laboratories were the institute of sciences of food production ispacnr (bari, italy) and the department of food science, university of
teramo (teramo, italy). aliquots of 10 g of ground blank durum wheat
were weighed in conical flasks for the preparation of blank and spiked
samples at four dichlorvos spiking levels. five sets of duplicate samples
were obtained by spiking with 200 µl each of hexane (blank) or
dichlorvos spiking solutions to obtain contamination levels of 0.25,
0.60, 1.00, and 1.50 µg/g. the spiking solvent was removed by
evaporation at room temperature for 1 h, and then each spiked sample
was extracted with hexane. the preparation and analysis of blank and
spiked samples (total of 20 samples in two laboratories) were performed
in the two testing laboratories, which received blind spiking solutions.
for further validation gc analyses were performed on a series of 10
blind samples by one of the laboratories and compared with electrochemical results.
statistical analysis. origin ver. 6.0 software (originlab corp.,
northampton, ma) was used for statistical analysis.
results and discussion

recently, dichlorvos has been determined in durum wheat
kernels by electrochemical assay using a choline oxidase
biosensor and pbs as extraction solvent and electrochemical
measuring buffer (32). however, such an extraction procedure
(using whole wheat kernels) might lead to inadequate homogeneity of testing samples. moreover, aqueous solvents cannot
be used for extraction of ground wheat samples due to the
formation of a slurry, preventing filtration of adequate amounts
of extract. to apply the electrochemical method to ground wheat
samples, as generally required in food analysis, a nonaqueous
extraction solvent was required. the extraction of pesticides
from different matrices is usually carried out with organic
solvents, such as methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, hexane, ethyl
acetate, or a combination of them (6-10). to select a good
extraction solvent for dichlorvos, the gc-npd technique was
used to check the recovery and repeatability characteristics of
the extraction procedure. when gc conventional methods for
the determination of pesticides in nonfatty foods (35-37) were
applied, the mean recoveries of dichlorvos were not higher than
40-45% in our laboratory. a possible explanation for these
low recoveries could be that dichlorvos is lost during cleanup
of the sample extract. to avoid possible loss of analyte during
cleanup steps, we decided to inject the filtered extract into the
gc apparatus without further purification. the use of methanol
as extraction solvent (10) resulted in a dirty extract, whereas
the mixture of acetone/hexane (ac/hex) 1:1 v/v gave a clean

extract with a good recovery and a limit of detection (signalto-noise 3:1) of 0.02 µg/g. in particular, using this extraction
solvent, mixture recoveries of dichlorvos from durum wheat
spiked at level of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 µg/g were 100 ( 12, 100 (
2, and 114 ( 7%, respectively. with the aim of analyzing the
ac/hex extracts with the electrochemical assay and considering
that ache activity is strongly influenced by the presence of
the solvent used, it was necessary to remove completely the
organic solvent (by evaporation) and dissolve the dichlorvos
residue in pbs. however, the evaporation step resulted in low
dichlorvos recovery (e30%), probably due to partial solubilization of the dichlorvos in pbs after evaporation of the organic
solvent. in fact, when the dried residue was redissolved in ac/
hex and injected in gc, the dichlorvos recoveries were
acceptable, ranging from 89 to 107%.
to overcome this problem, a liquid-liquid partitioning of
organic solvent with pbs was carried out. this procedure
increased the efficiency of dichlorvos transfer from organic
extraction solvent to pbs avoiding drying of the extract.
nevertheless, this procedure could not be applied with the ac/
hex mixture because acetone passed into the pbs phase, thus
influencing the ache activity. to overcome this problem,
hexane was tested as extraction solvent. recovery efficiency
and repeatability of results were checked by gc-npd analysis
of filtered sample extract from spiked wheat. figure 1 shows
the chromatogram of durum wheat spiked with 0.6 µg/g of
dichlorvos eluting with a retention time of 7.9 min. the limit
of detection was 0.02 µg/g, and good recovery and repeatability
results were obtained as shown in table 1. in particular,
recoveries ranged from 96.5 to 100.9%, showing that the
extraction method with hexane was suitable for a quantitative
extraction of dichlorvos from ground wheat.
the main advantage of the gc method reported herein is its
rapidity coupled with an acceptable limit of detection. the
method also showed good repeatability, which is comparable
with that obtained with other published gc methods (6-10).
these methods have been used for the analysis of air, vegetables,
water, soil, wastes, and a variety of food commodities with limits
of detection ranging from below picograms per gram to a few

micrograms per gram depending on the matrices and cleanup
procedure used. the lod of the method developed herein is 4
times greater than the one reported by crisp and tarrant, who
used a cleanup step with a charcoal column before gc
determination of dichlorvos in wheat (10). however, the limit
of 0.02 µg/g could be reasonably acceptable, taking into account
the limit accepted by official organization, and the lack of a
cleanup step allows the total time of analysis to be drastically
reduced. in fact, as several extractions can be realized simultaneously, once the filtered extracts are obtained, a large number
of analyses can be performed by using an autosampler.
to perform electrochemical analysis with the choline oxidase
biosensor, dichlorvos needed to be transferred to pbs solution,
thus avoiding any electrochemical interference by organic solvents. therefore, the filtered hexane extract was submitted to
liquid-liquid partitioning with pbs and the upper organic layer
was removed by evaporation. finally, the buffer solution containing dichlorvos was analyzed by the biosensor. dichlorvos
was easily measured in ground wheat by electrochemical bioassay at levels as low as 0.05 µg/g. moreover, the use of hexane
as extraction solvent should reduce the effect of water-soluble
matrix components, potentially interfering with the assay. however, a residual matrix effect that reduced the assay sensitivity
was still observed; therefore, calibration curves were prepared
in matrix extracts for the accurate determination of dichlorvos.
as shown in figure 2 the calibration curve was almost linear
in the range of 0.05-0.40 µg/ml, but at higher concentrations
(between 0.40 and 0.80 µg/ml) quantification was shown to
be less accurate. to overcome this problem, sample extracts
producing inhibition either near or higher than the 0.40 µg/ml
point of the calibration curve were appropriately diluted with
hexane and analyzed again in order to produce inhibition that
fell within the linear part of the calibration curve. for the quantification of dichlorvos in these samples it was necessary to prepare a new calibration curve with diluted blank extract in order
to load the same amount of matrix on the working electrode.
the matrix-assisted calibration curve of dichlorvos was
described by the following equation reported, which fits the
inhibition data:

y ) 78.63 -

the detection limit of 0.02 µg/ml (equivalent to 0.05 µg/g
in wheat) was calculated using the i value (i ) 5.7%) obtained

from the formula i (%) ) i0 - (i0 - 3 × sdi0)/i0 in the
calibration curve equation, where sdi0 is the standard deviation
of three measurements of a blank sample. the calculated  xxxd1289xxx 
was 0.360 µg/ml (equivalent to 0.90 µg/g in wheat). the inset
in figure 2 shows the calibration curve of dichlorvos in the
working range 0.05-0.40 µg/ml (equivalent to 0.125-1.000
µg/g in matrix) obtained using the blank extract after 1:3
dilution. the equation describing this curve is

y ) 65.85 -

these equations were used for the calculation of dichlorvos
in wheat sample extracts, where y is i (%) and x is the dichlorvos
concentration (µg/ml). the amounts of matrix equivalent loaded
on the working electrode to record the first and second calibration curves were 40 and 13.3 mg, respectively. the increase
of matrix amount led to a different inhibition, showing a residual
matrix effect. in particular, the inhibitions produced by 0.20
µg/ml (equivalent to 0.5 µg/g in matrix) dichlorvos were 34.9
and 27.5% with 13.3 and 40 mg of matrix, respectively.
the method was peer-validated by two laboratories, and the
results of the validation test are reported in table 2.
as shown in table 2 mean recoveries of dichlorvos ranged
from 97 to 108%, rsdr values ranged from 5.5 to 7.8%, and
rsdr values ranged from 9.9 to 17.6%. the dichlorvos mean
recovery was calculated for each spiking level as the mean of
four measurements, n ) 4 (see table 2). no false negative or
false positive results were obtained by the electrochemical assay.
a good correlation between dichlorvos concentrations obtained
by electrochemical biosensor and gc analysis was also found
as shown in figure 3. the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.9919,
and data were fitted to the linear regression by the equation

electrochemical biosensors have been previously used for the
determination of organophosphorus pesticides in standard solutions and real samples such as fruits, vegetables, foods of animal
origin, and cereals such as wheat and rice (12-29). however,
application to real food samples for the detection of dichlorvos
is lacking. in particular, detection of dichlorvos by amperometric
sensors was reported with limits of detection of 1.6 × 10-6
mol/l (15) and 4.5 × 10-9 mol/l (16). screen-printed electrodes
modified with cobalt phthalocyanine were also reported to have
detection limits of 10-8 mol/l (17) and 6 × 10-9 mol/l (18).
a higher limit of detection for dichlorvos (6 × 10-6 mol/l)
was reported using a dual amperometric-potentiometric bio-

sensor (19). determinations of dichlorvos were also performed
in buffer/ xxxd102xxx , showing a detection limit of 0.5 ×
10-6 mol/l (20). biosensors prepared by immobilization of
genetically modified ache with a photosensitive polymer or
by using metal chelate affinity gave limits of detection of 2.5
× 10-9 and 1.5 × 10-9 mol/l, respectively (27). recently, the
use of biosensors based on recombinant ache led to exceptionally low dichlorvos limits of detection (10-17 mol/l) (28, 29).
nevertheless, all of these results were obtained with solutions
of dichlorvos, and no application to real samples has been
reported. in particular, no data were reported on the recovery,
repeatability, and reproducibility tests performed on food
commodities, such as wheat, or on the matrix effect on these
biosensors. the use of recombinant aches is a promising
alternative due to their very low limit of detection but is limited
because they are not commercially available.
the only electrochemical acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay
for the detection of dichlorvos in food has been only recently
developed, and the method, as already mentioned, was applicable only to whole grain kernels with an lod of 0.45 µg/g
(32). the method reported herein is based on the same
electrochemical end determination; however, the different
extraction procedure and sample preparation allowed a much
lower lod to be obtained, making the procedure applicable to
ground wheat. this method allows determination of dichlorvos
in ground wheat at levels as low as 0.05 µg/g (and up to 1.0
µg/g), which is 40 times lower than the european legal limit.
the sensitivity of method might satisfactorily respond to the
epa requirement to eliminate dichlorvos from agricultural food
commodities. accurate determination of dichlorvos at levels
>1.0 µg/g can also be performed by analyzing appropriately
diluted sample extracts. the limit of detection obtained with
the proposed procedure is 0.05 µg/g in durum wheat, corresponding to 9 × 10-8 mol/l in the final matrix extract solution.
this limit is comparable with those reported above for commercial ache. recovery, rsdr, and rsdr values demonstrated
that the electrochemical method proposed herein is robust and
can be easily applicable to real samples of wheat. finally, the
electrochemical biosensor allows rapid measurements, is easy
to use, and above all is inexpensive.
