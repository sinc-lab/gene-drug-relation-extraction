abstract
a number of proteins and nucleic acids have been
explored as therapeutic targets. these targets are
subjects of interest in different areas of biomedical
and pharmaceutical research and in the development
and evaluation of bioinformatics, molecular modeling,
computer-aided drug design and analytical tools. a
publicly accessible database that provides comprehensive information about these targets is therefore
helpful to the relevant communities. the therapeutic
target database (ttd) is designed to provide information about the known therapeutic protein and
nucleic acid targets described in the literature, the
targeted disease conditions, the pathway information
and the corresponding drugs/ligands directed at each
of these targets. cross-links to other databases are
also introduced to facilitate the access of information
about the sequence, 3d structure, function, nomenclature, drug/ligand binding properties, drug usage
and effects, and related literature for each target. this
database can be accessed at http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/
group/ttd/ttd.asp and it currently contains entries for
433 targets covering 125 disease conditions along
with 809 drugs/ligands directed at each of these
targets. each entry can be retrieved through multiple
methods including target name, disease name, drug/
ligand name, drug/ligand function and drug therapeutic
classification.
introduction
pharmaceutical agents generally exert their therapeutic effect
by binding to a particular protein or nucleic acid target (1,2).
so far, hundreds of proteins and nucleic acids have been
explored as therapeutic targets (1). rapid advances in genetic
(3), structural (4) and functional (5) information of disease
related genes and proteins not only raise strong interest in the
search of new therapeutic targets, but also promote the study of
various aspects of known targets including molecular mechanism
of their binding agents and related adverse effects (6), and pharmacogenetic implications of sequence or proteomic variations (7),
etc. the knowledge gained from such a study is important in
facilitating the design of more potent, less toxic and personalized
drugs. development of advanced computational methods for

figure 1. the web interface of ttd. five types of search mode are supported.
this database is searchable by target name, disease name, drug/ligand name,
drug/ligand function, drug classification or any combination of these.

bioinformatics (4), molecular modeling (8), drug design and
pharmacokinetics analysis (9–11) increasingly uses known
therapeutic targets to refine and test algorithms and parameters.
a publicly accessible database that provides comprehensive
information about these targets is therefore helpful in catering
for the need and interest of the relevant communities in general
and those unfamiliar with a specific therapeutic target in
particular. to the best of the authors’ knowledge, such a
publicly accessible database is not yet available. in this work,
we introduce a therapeutic target database (ttd), which
contains information about the known therapeutic protein and
nucleic acid targets together with the targeted disease conditions,
the pathway information and the corresponding drugs/ligands
directed at each of these targets. cross-links to other databases
are introduced to facilitate the access of information regarding
the function, sequence, 3d structure, nomenclature, drug/
ligand binding properties and related literatures of each target.
the therapeutic targets collected in ttd are from a search of
the available literature. it has been reported that, at present,
approximately 500 therapeutic targets have been exploited in
the currently available medical treatment (1). an effort has
been made to collect as many of these known targets as
possible. however, description of some of these targets in the
literature was not specific enough to point to a particular
protein or nucleic acid as the target. hence these targets are not
included in our database.

database structure and access
ttd has a web interface at http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/
ttd/ttd.asp. the entries of this database are generated from a
search of pharmacology textbooks (12,13), review articles (14–21)
and a number of recent publications. our database currently
contains 433 entries of protein and nucleic acid targets found from
the literature. these targets cover 125 different disease conditions,
which are described in the database. drugs and ligands
directed at each of these targets are searched and included in
the database. a total of 809 different drugs and ligands are
listed in the database.
the ttd database web interface is shown in figure 1. this
database is searchable by target name or drug/ligand name. it

can also be accessed by selection of disease name, drug/ligand
function or drug therapeutic classification from the list
provided in the corresponding selection field. searches
involving any combination of these five search or selection fields
are also supported. the lists of disease names, drug/ligand
functions and drug classifications are given in tables 1, 2 and
3, respectively.
the search is case insensitive. in a query, a user can specify
full name or any part of the name in a text field, or choose one
item from a selection field. wild characters of ‘%’ and ‘_’ are
supported in text field. here, ‘_’ represents any one character
and ‘%’ represents a string of characters of any length. for
example, input of ‘phosphatase’ in the target name field finds
entries containing ‘phosphatase’ in their name, such as
cdc25a phosphatase or  xxxd3459xxx  phosphatase. on the other
hand, input of ‘cdc25_ phosphatase’ finds entries with names
like cdc25a phosphatase, cdc25b phosphatase and  xxxg401xxx 
phosphatase. likewise, input of cdc% phosphatase finds the
same entries as above. in this case, ‘%’ represents ‘25a’,
‘25b’, ‘25c’, respectively.
the result of a typical search is illustrated in figure 2. in this
interface, all the therapeutic targets that satisfy the search
criteria are listed along with the disease conditions to be
treated, drugs or ligands directed at the target, and the drug
class. more detailed information of a target can be obtained by
clicking the corresponding target name. the result is displayed
in an interface shown in figure 3. from this interface, one
finds target name, corresponding disease  xxxd1866xxx  and crosslink to karolinska disease database (http://www.kib.ki.se/),
target function in pathway and corresponding natural ligand,
known drugs or ligands directed at the target, drug function
(such as inhibitor, antagonist and blocker, etc.), drug therapeutic
classification, and additional cross-links to other databases that
provide useful information about the target.
the functional properties of an identified target can be
obtained through cross-linking to the on-line medical
dictionary (omd) database (http://www.graylab.ac.uk/omd/)
and the swiss-prot database (22). the target sequence can
be retrieved from cross-link to the swiss-prot database.
the available 3d structure of this target can be accessed
through cross-linking to the protein data bank (pdb) database
(23). for an enzymatic target, its nomenclature can be obtained
from cross-link to the enzyme data bank (24). ligand-binding
properties may be obtained from cross-link to the computed

figure 3. interface of the detailed information of target in ttd. information
related to disease, drug/ligand, pathway and some of the cross-database shortcuts
are provided. in the case of one target having multi ligands, the ligands are
separated with ‘|’, as well as their functions and cas numbers.

ligand binding energy database (clibe) (http://
xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/clibe.asp). the related literature
can be accessed from cross-link to the relevant entries in the
pubmed database (25).
as the research in proteomics (26) and pathways (27)
progresses, the relevant information can be incorporated or the
corresponding databases can be cross-linked to ttd to provide
more comprehensive information about the drug targets and
their relationship to other biomolecules and cellular processes.
