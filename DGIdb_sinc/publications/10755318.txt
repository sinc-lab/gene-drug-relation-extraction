n,n-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy] ethanamine (dppe),
a chemopotentiating and cytoprotective agent in clinical trials:
interaction with histamine at  xxxg590xxx 
and other isozymes that metabolize antineoplastic drugs
received: 26 april 1999 / accepted: 3 september 1999

abstract purpose:  xxxd3322xxx  á hcl (dppe), an intracellular histamine (ha) antagonist with chemopotentiating and
cytoprotective properties, is currently in phase 2 and 3
clinical trials in breast and prostate cancer. dppe
modulates growth at in vitro concentrations that antagonize ha binding to cytochromes p450 in rat liver
microsomes. ha inhibits p450 metabolism of some
drugs. recent in vitro studies in human colon cancer
cells have linked dppe enhancement of paclitaxel,
doxorubicin and vinblastine cytotoxicity to inhibition
of the p-glycoprotein (p-gp) pump. many substrates of
p-gp are also substrates of cyp3a4, a p450 isozyme
that metabolizes a variety of antineoplastic agents and
is highly expressed in some malignant tissues. therefore, we assessed whether (a) dppe and ha interact at
cyp3a4 and other p450 human isozymes, and (b)
dppe inhibits the catalytic activity of cyp3a4.
methods: using spectral analysis, we measured dppe
and ha binding to insect microsomes that express
human p450 isozymes 1a1, 2b6, 2d6 or 3a4. employing thin-layer chromatography, we assessed the
metabolism of dppe by each isozyme and dppe
inhibition of testosterone metabolism by cyp3a4 and
by rat liver microsomes. results: (1) dppe evoked
``type i'' (substrate site binding) absorbance-dierence
spectra with cyp2d6 (ks  4.1  0.4 lm), cyp3a4
(ks  31 15 lm) and  xxxg575xxx  (ks  40  9 lm),

but not with  xxxg583xxx . (2) in correspondence with the
binding studies, dppe was metabolized by cyp2d6,
cyp3a4 and  xxxg575xxx ; no metabolism occurred with
 xxxg583xxx . (3) ha evoked ``type ii'' (heme iron binding)
absorbance-dierence spectra with all four isozymes,
with ks values in the range 80±600 lm. dppe inhibited ha (600 lm) binding to cyp2d6 (ic50  4 lm,
95% ci  1.8±8.9 lm) and  xxxg575xxx  (ic50  135 lm:
95% ci  100±177 lm), but stimulated ha (500 and
1000 lm) binding to cyp3a4 (ec50  155 lm, 95%
ci  104±231 lm). dppe did not aect ha binding
to  xxxg583xxx . (4) dppe inhibited the metabolism of
testosterone by cyp3a4. the concentration/eect
curve was biphasic: dppe inhibited metabolism by
30% at the ®rst site (ic50  3 lm, 95% ci  0.5±
25.5 lm), and an additional 70% inhibition occurred
at the second site (ic50  350 lm, 95% ci  215±
570 lm). a similar result was observed with rat liver
microsomes. conclusion: dppe is a substrate for
cyp3a4, cyp2d6 and  xxxg575xxx , but not  xxxg583xxx .
dppe inhibits testosterone metabolism by interacting
at two sites on cyp3a4, the ®rst correlating with its
ks value to bind the substrate site and the second, with
its ec50 value to enhance ha binding to the heme
iron. we postulate that (1) the inhibitory eect of
dppe on cyp3a4 activity is mediated directly at the
substrate site and indirectly by its enhancement of the
binding of ha to the heme moiety; (2) in tumor cells
that express high constitutive levels of cyp3a4,
potentiation of chemotherapy cytotoxicity by dppe
results, in part, from inhibition of cyp3a4-mediated
metabolism and p-gp-mediated eux of antineoplastic
drugs; (3) in normal cells that express low constitutive
levels of the isozyme, cytoprotection by dppe results,
in part, from induction of cyp3a4 and p-gp, resulting
in an increase both in metabolism and eux of antineoplastic drugs.

introduction
 xxxd3322xxx  á
hcl (dppe) is an arylalkylamine derivative [3] with
structural similarity to various h1-antihistamines, neuroleptics and triphenylethylene antiestrogens [5]. dppe
is a potent ligand for so-called antiestrogen (tamoxifen)
binding sites (aebs) [3], antagonizes the binding of
histamine (ha) to aebs-related sites in microsomes
and nuclei [7], and modulates cell proliferation in vitro
[4] and in vivo [6]. a major proportion of the microsomal sites with anity for dppe and ha represents
cytochrome p450 monooxygenases [11]. nebert [26] has
proposed that, through their metabolism of endogenous
lipid mediators such as steroid hormones and prostanoids, p450 enzymes regulate cell homeostasis and
growth. a similar role for ha was postulated by
kahlson and rosengren [17] 30 years ago. in support of
their hypothesis, we have observed that ha binds
directly to the heme iron of p450 [20], and have found a
strong correlation among drug potencies to inhibit ha
binding to p450 in rat liver microsomes, p450-mediated
demethylation of aminopyrine and mitogenesis, and to
modulate experimental tumor growth in rodents [19].
we have proposed that ha is a modulator of the catalytic activity of p450 enzymes and that perturbation
of the ha/p450 complex by dppe and other aebs
ligands may disrupt steady-state levels of monooxygenase-generated mediators of proliferation [11, 19].
in rodents, dppe protects the bone marrow from
toxic doses of doxorubicin and 5-¯uorouracil [8] and the
gut from noxious physical and chemical stimuli [13]. in
contrast, dppe potentiates cytotoxicity in cancer cells
exposed to various chemotherapeutic agents, including
doxorubicin, resulting in an increased cure rate of experimental tumors [8]. in phase 2 trials in humans with
various refractory malignancies [9], including prostate
and breast cancer [2, 10], increased response rates, usually with low systemic toxicity, have been observed when
dppe is combined with single antineoplastic drugs such
as cyclophosphamide [10] or doxorubicin [2].
recent studies have yielded potentially valuable new
insights into possible mechanism(s) of action of dppe.
in the multidrug-resistant human colon cancer cell line,
hct 116/ xxxg10xxx +, dppe potentiates the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin, paclitaxel and vinblastine, inhibits the
p-glycoprotein (p-gp) pump ( xxxg10xxx ), decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and depletes cellular atp
[22]. most substrates and/or inhibitors of p-gp are also
substrates and/or inhibitors of cyp3a4 [29], a p450
isozyme that accounts for between 30% and 70% of the
total p450 content in liver microsomes, and metabolizes
many hormones and drugs [15], including various antihistamines, tamoxifen and antineoplastic agents, such as
taxanes, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and some anthracycline analogs [29]. moreover, levels of p-gp and cyp3a4 are
coordinately up- or downregulated by the same chemical

agents in ls180/ad50 human colon cancer cells [27].
based on these reports, we carried out studies to assess
(a) the interaction of dppe and ha with cyp3a4 and
other p450 isozymes that metabolize a wide range of
drugs, including antineoplastic agents and (b) the inhibition of the catalytic activity of cyp3a4 by dppe.

materials and methods
reagents
dppe was synthesized, as described previously [3]. 3h-dppe
(35.6 ci/mmol) was custom-synthesized by dupont-new england
nuclear (boston, mass.). 3h-testosterone (55 ci/mmol) was purchased from dupont-nen.  xxxd3327xxx  and histamine
dihydrochloride were purchased from sigma chemical co.
(oakville, ont.).
puri®ed p450 isozymes
the following insect (baculovirus-infected drosophila) microsomes
that express cdna for a single human p450 isozyme were obtained
from gentest corporation (woburn, mass.):  xxxg575xxx  (metabolizes many aryl hydrocarbons and procarcinogens),  xxxg583xxx  +
cytochrome b5 (metabolizes cyclophosphamide), cyp2d6
(metabolizes many arylalkylamines, including tamoxifen), and
cyp3a4 + cytochrome b5 (metabolizes many arylalkylamines
and antineoplastic agents).
preparation of rat liver microsomes
livers were removed from freshly killed male sprague-dawley rats
(university of manitoba central animal facility), minced, suspended (10% wt/vol) in 0.25 m sucrose, homogenized with six to
eight passes in a motor-driven te¯on-pestle glass vessel and centrifuged (13,000 g, 15 min, 4 °c). the supernatant was decanted
and centrifuged (144,000 g, 95 min, 4 °c). the resulting pellet was
resuspended in 5 mm tris buer (ph 8.5) at a ®nal concentration
of 4 mg protein/ml, centrifuged (144,000 g, 35 min, 4 °c), resuspended in tris buer (10±20 mg protein/ml) and stored at )80 °c
until used.
spectral analysis
the absorbance-dierence spectrum of p450-bound dppe or ha
was measured with a pharmacia ultraspec 4000 spectrophotometer. a swift ii computer software program controlled and operated
the unit and collected and plotted the spectral data. to obtain
spectra, p450 isozyme (®nal p450 concentration about 150 pm/ml;
protein concentration about 0.6 mg/ml) was suspended in 5 mm
tris buer (ph 8.5; ®nal volume 0.1 ml) containing dppe (30±
100 lm) or ha (30±1000 lm) or both. actual ks values were
determined by employing the ligand program [25] to analyze
absorbance-dierence spectra. ic50 values for inhibition by dppe
of ha binding to the isozymes were determined using prism
(version 2; graphpad, san diego, calif.), a curve-®tting program
employing weighted nonlinear regression analysis.
measurement of dppe metabolism
to measure metabolism of dppe by the various p450 isozymes,
0.2 ml of a mixture containing a ®nal concentration of 40 lm
dppe, 20 nm 3h-dppe, 50 mm glucose-6-phosphate, 3 mm
nadp, 2 u  xxxg825xxx  and insect microsomes, adjusted to a p450 concentration of 0.1 lm, in 50 mm

300
k3po4 and 3.3 mm mgcl2 buers (ph 7.4) was added to replicate
1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. following incubation (4 h, 37 °c) the
reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml etoh and the tubes
centrifuged (15,000 g, 10 min, 4 °c). a 1-ml aliquot of each supernatant was dried under a nitrogen stream, and the residues were
dissolved in 0.1 ml etoh and applied to 20 ´ 20 cm 250 lm hardsurfaced silica gel thin layer chromatography (tlc) plates. the
plates were developed in a toluene/triethylamine (9:1) mixture, airdried for 10 min and scanned with a bioscan systems 200 imaging
scanner. the amount of each product was determined by measuring the radioactivity under the peak and expressed as percentage of
the total radioactivity.
measurement of testosterone metabolism
to assess the eect of dppe on the cyp3a4-mediated conversion of testosterone to 6b-oh-testosterone, a 0.2-ml mixture
containing dppe (0±1000 lm, ®nal concentration), 100 lm cold
testosterone, 26 nm 3h-testosterone (dupont nen), 50 mm
glucose-6-phosphate, 3 mm nadp, 2 u glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase and 5 pmol puri®ed isozymes or 20 lg rat liver
microsome protein in 50 mm k3po4 and 3.3 mm mgcl2 (ph 7.4)
was added to replicate 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. following incubation (10 min, 37 °c) the reaction was stopped by the addition
of 1 ml etoh and the tubes centrifuged (15,000 g, 10 min, 4 °c).
a 1-ml aliquot of each supernatant was dried under a nitrogen
stream, the residues dissolved in 0.1 ml etoh and applied to
20 ´ 20 cm 250 lm hard-surfaced silica gel tlc plates. the
plates were developed in a dichloromethane/acetone (4:1) mixture,
air-dried for 10 min, developed a second time in the same solvent,
air-dried and scanned with a bioscan systems 200 imaging scanner. the amount of 6b-oh-testosterone was determined by calculating the radioactivity under the peak, and expressed relative
to the total radioactivity. the ic50 values for inhibition by dppe
of testosterone metabolism were determined by prism (version
2). the threshold p-value was set to 0.05 to determine signi®cance
for a two-site ®t.

results
the addition of dppe to insect microsomes expressing
cyp2d6, cyp3a4 or  xxxg575xxx  produced a ``type i''
spectrum, with a peak at approximately 385 nm and a
trough at approximately 420 nm (fig. 1), typical of ligands that bind to the substrate site in the heme cavity.
ks values for dppe binding to each isozyme (table 1)
were as follows: 4.1  0.4 lm (cyp2d6), 31  15 lm
(cyp3a4), 40  9 lm ( xxxg575xxx ). dppe did not generate a spectrum with  xxxg583xxx  (data not shown).
in contrast to dppe, addition of ha to rat liver
microsomes, or to individual isozymes, produced a

``type ii'' absorbance-dierence spectrum (fig. 2) with a
trough at approximately 390±410 nm and a peak at
approximately 425±435 nm, typical of compounds, including imidazoles, that bind to the heme moiety of the
enzyme [19]. with equivalent concentrations (p450/mg
protein) of cyp3a4,  xxxg575xxx ,  xxxg583xxx  or cyp2d6, a
saturating concentration of ha (1000 lm) produced
absorbance-dierence spectra with peak-to-trough distances (da) ranging between 0.0039 and 0.0052 absorbance units (fig. 2). actual ks values for ha
binding to each isozyme (table 1) were as follows: 80 
16 lm ( xxxg575xxx ), 114  29 lm (cyp3a4), 356 
76 lm (cyp2d6), and 600  200 lm ( xxxg583xxx ).
dppe antagonized ha binding to cyp2d6
(ic50  4 lm, 95% ci  1.8±8.9 lm) and  xxxg575xxx 
(ic50  137 lm, 95% ci  100±187 lm; fig. 3). in
contrast, dppe enhanced ha binding to cyp3a4
(ec50  155 lm, 95% ci  104±231 lm). this stimulatory eect was maximal at a dppe concentration of
600 lm and then diminished at higher concentrations
(fig. 3). dppe did not aect ha binding to  xxxg583xxx 
(data not shown).
correlating with the spectral data for dppe anities
for the isozymes (table 1), incubation of dppe with
cyp2d6, cyp3a4 and  xxxg575xxx  led to the formation
of at least ®ve products (fig. 4);  xxxg583xxx  was inactive
except for the production of a small amount of product
4 (fig. 4). based on the radioactivity in the product
peaks, cyp2d6 was most avid to metabolize dppe,
followed by cyp3a4 and  xxxg575xxx , which were approximately equal to one another in potency. component 1, also present at the origin when control
microsomes were used (fig. 4), had been previously
determined to contain 4-hydroxydiphenylmethane, a
starting product of dppe synthesis. the observed increase in this component in the presence of the isozymes
may represent oxidation products that, like the impurity,

isozymes (100±150 pmol p450/ml). dppe evoked a ``type i''
spectrum with (a) cyp2d6, (b) cyp3a4 and (c)  xxxg575xxx , but
not with  xxxg583xxx . the peak at approximately 385 nm and trough
at approximately 420 nm is typical for ligands that bind to the
substrate site on the enzyme

previous observations in rat liver microsomes that ha
binds to a composite of p450 enzymes (ks  90 
17 lm) [11]. based on the data presented here, the potency of ha to bind rat microsomal p450 [11] may
largely re¯ect its ks values for binding to cyp2d6,
cyp3a2 (the rat ortholog of rat cyp3a4) and
 xxxg575xxx  (table 1), the three most abundant rat liver
p450 isozymes. our data suggest, also, that microsomal
``aebs'' represents the substrate site, located mainly on
cyp2d6, cyp3a4, and  xxxg575xxx  that recognizes
dppe, tamoxifen and other arylalkylamine drugs that
interact with ha at rat microsomal p450 [19].
the excellent correlation between the potency of
dppe to bind the substrate site on cyp2d6 and
potency to inhibit ha binding suggest that dppe

fig. 2 absorbance-dierence spectra produced by the addition of
ha (1000 lm) to insect microsomes (128 pmol p450/ml) expressing (a) cyp3a4, (b) cyp2d6, (c)  xxxg575xxx  or (d)  xxxg583xxx . ha
produced a ``type ii'' spectrum with each isozyme, with a trough at
approximately 400 nm and a peak at approximately 430 nm,
typical for imidazole compounds that bind to the heme iron

remained at the origin. the two largest radioactive peaks
(4 and 5) were believed to represent the major metabolites, 4-hydroxy-dppe and n-desmethyl-dppe.
the conversion of testosterone to 6b-oh-testosterone by cyp3a4 was inhibited by dppe (fig. 5). the
concentration/eect curve was biphasic (ic50  3 lm,
95% ci  0.5±25.5 lm, and ic50  350 lm, 95%
ci  215±570 lm), suggesting that dppe acted, at
least, at two sites. in rat liver microsomes, where testosterone was metabolized into ®ve general products
(fig. 6), dppe inhibited the formation of metabolites
1±4 with equal potency. as with puri®ed cyp3a4,
the concentration/eect curve for dppe was biphasic (ic50  23 lm, 95% ci  5.3±103 lm, and
ic50  385 lm, 95% ci  127±1160 lm). dppe inhibited the formation of metabolite 5 much more weakly
(ic50  900 lm, 95% ci  640±1300 lm).

discussion
the parameters of ha binding to the four human p450
isozymes (ks range: 80±600 lm) are consistent with our

fig. 3 eect of dppe on the absorbance-dierence spectrum
produced by the addition of 500±1000 lm ha to insect microsomes (about 125 pmol p450/ml) expressing (a) cyp2d6, (b)
 xxxg575xxx  or (c) cyp3a4. dppe inhibited ha binding to cyp2d6
(n  4) and  xxxg575xxx  (n  3), and enhanced ha binding to
cyp3a4 (n  2). dppe did not aect ha binding to  xxxg583xxx 
(n  3; data not shown)

fig. 4 metabolism of dppe (40 lg) after 4 h incubation (37 °c)
by control (no p450 present) and  xxxg583xxx -,  xxxg575xxx -, cyp3a4or cyp2d6-expressing insect microsomes (100 pmol p450/ml)
(bars, representing product peaks, are labelled on cyp3a4; the
dppe peak is not shown). total radioactivity in each isozyme
experiment averaged 3000  400 c.p.m. radioactivity in the
parent dppe lanes were as follows: cyp2d6 520 c.p.m. (20% of
total radioactivity); cyp3a4 1370 c.p.m. (50% of total radioactivity);  xxxg575xxx  1990 c.p.m. (90% of total radioactivity); cyp 2b6
3100 c.p.m. (91% of total radioactivity). control microsomes do
not show any metabolite-containing peaks; the bar at the origin
corresponding to peak 1 represents a previously identi®ed impurity
(4-hydroxydiphenylmethane, a starting product of dppe synthesis). microsomes expressing  xxxg575xxx , cyp3a4, or cyp2d6 show
®ve radioactive peaks (bars 2±6) representing dppe derivatives.
the increase in product 1, as compared to control microsomes, may
have resulted from the production of oxidation products that, like
4-hydroxydiphenylmethane, remained at the origin. the number
and location of products were identical for cyp3a4 and cyp2d6;
however, cyp2d6 produced higher radioactive peaks than
cyp3a4. products 4 and 5 are thought to represent the major
metabolites, 4-hydroxy-dppe and n-desmethyl-dppe. product 4
was higher relative to product 5 in microsomes expressing
 xxxg575xxx , while product 5 was higher relative to product 4 in
microsomes expressing cyp3a4 or cyp2d6. microsomes expressing  xxxg583xxx  show a minor increase in product 4, the only
observed change as compared to control microsomes

allosterically inhibited ha binding to the heme iron. a
weaker correlation was observed at  xxxg575xxx . moreover,
despite binding with approximately equal potency
(ks  31 and 40 lm, respectively) to the substrate sites
on cyp3a4 and  xxxg575xxx , dppe inhibited ha binding
to  xxxg575xxx  (ic50  137 lm) but enhanced ha binding
to cyp3a4 (ec50  155 lm). these ®ndings suggest
dierences in amino acid sequence among isozymes that
could alter the proximity of the substrate site to the ha
site, resulting in the observed dierences in interactive
binding potencies and determining whether dppe antagonizes or enhances ha binding.
the concentration/eect curve for dppe to inhibit
testosterone metabolism by cyp3a4 (fig. 5) suggests
two sites of action. at the ®rst site (ic50  3 lm, 95%
ci  0.5±25.5 lm), 30% inhibition occurs within the
range of ks values (31  15 lm) for dppe to bind the
substrate site. the serum concentration in patients receiving dppe by infusion has been measured at 3±5 lm
[9], suggesting that substrate site inhibition of cyp3a4
also occurs at achievable concentrations of dppe

fig. 5 inhibition by dppe of the conversion of testosterone to 6bhydroxy-testosterone by insect microsomes expressing cyp3a4.
control radioactivity  1700 c.p.m. analysis of the concentration/
eect curve showed that dppe inhibited the enzyme at 2 sites
(n  2; p < 0.05)

in vivo. at the second site (ic50  350 lm, 95%
ci  215±570 lm), an additional 70% inhibition occurs
within the range of ic50 values (104±231 lm) for dppe
to enhance ha binding to the heme iron moiety of the
isozyme. ha inhibits p450-mediated 9-hydroxylation
and o-demethylation of metoprolol (ic50  160 and
240 lm, respectively) [24]. thus, dppe may inhibit
cyp3a4-mediated metabolism of testosterone, in part,
by competing for the hormone at the substrate site and,
in part, by increasing ha binding to the heme iron.
cyp3a4 expression reportedly is increased in many
human tumors [29]. thus, the demonstration that dppe
is a substrate for, increases ha binding to, and inhibits
the catalytic activity of, cyp3a4 may explain, in large
part, its observed potentiation of antineoplastic drugs
that are metabolized, also, by cyp3a4. that dppe is
also an inhibitor/substrate of the p-gp pump [22] is in
accordance with the reported overlap of drug anities
for both cyp3a4 and p-gp [29]. in addition, the reported depletion of cellular atp by dppe [22] suggests
another mechanism underlying inhibition of the p-gp
pump, which is atp-driven.

fig. 6 inhibition by dppe of the metabolism of testosterone by
rat liver microsomes (containing a full complement of p450
isozymes) (control radioactivity 4100 c.p.m.). dppe inhibited the
formation of peaks 1±4 with equal potency. analysis of the
concentration/eect curve showed that this inhibition occurred at
two sites (p < 0.05). dppe inhibited the formation of peak 5
much more weakly

we propose that in tumor cells, which may express
high constitutive levels of certain p450 isozymes [29],
enhancement by dppe of chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity results from its inhibition of both cyp3a4mediated drug metabolism and p-gp pump-mediated
drug eux. in normal cells, which, with the exception of
liver and adrenal tissue, have low constitutive levels of
p450, the cytoprotective eects of dppe result from the
induction of both cyp3a4 and p-gp, thereby increasing
drug metabolism and/or p-gp-mediated drug eux.
drug induction of p450 isozymes, speci®cally cyp3a4,
occurs in gut endothelial cells [29] and blood leukocytes
[21], tissues that appear to be protected by dppe from
the eects of cytotoxic agents [8, 13]. induction of p450s
in gastrointestinal epithelium may also account for the
®nding that the level of prostacyclin (pgi2) in gastrointestinal juice is increased almost sevenfold in dppetreated rats [14].
dppe neither binds to, nor is signi®cantly metabolized by,  xxxg583xxx , a p450 isozyme also implicated in the
metabolism of cyclophosphamide [12]. thus, intratumoral potentiation of this chemotherapeutic agent by
dppe [10] may be mediated exclusively at cyp3a4.
since cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that is activated by
 xxxg583xxx  and, to a lesser extent, by cyp3a4 in the liver
[12], induction by dppe of hepatic cyp3a4 may help
to augment the conversion of the drug to its active form,
thereby further enhancing its systemic antitumor eect.
the ability of dppe to decrease mitochondrial
function [22] also could result from inhibition of mitochondrial p450 enzymes, including cyp3a4 [1]. both an
inhibitory eect on mitochondria and depletion of cellular atp [22] may account for the reported potentiation by dppe of  xxxd1709xxx  [16], and other drugs [2, 9]
not metabolized by p450. an alternative and as-yetuntested hypothesis is that dppe might modulate the
activity of glutathione-s-transferase, a non-p450 enzyme
implicated in cell resistance to drugs such as  xxxd1709xxx  [18].
dppe has higher anity for cyp2d6 than for
cyp3a4 (table 1). polymorphism of cyp2d6 is found
in 8% of humans [28]. high tissue levels of this isozyme
would be expected to metabolize dppe and limit access
to cyp3a4, rendering the drug less eective to potentiate antineoplastic agents. in such cases, the concomitant administration of a selective cyp2d6 substrate,
such as quinidine [23], might enhance the availability of
dppe to bind cyp3a4.
previously, we have shown that, in addition to dppe
and other arylalkylamine drugs that stimulate or inhibit
cell growth [19], the polyamines ( xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine) demonstrate potent interactive binding with ha at
p450 in rat liver microsomes [11]. on the basis of our
studies and those of others [25], we have postulated that
ha may modulate the catalytic activity of the monooxygenases [11] and that the ha/p450 complex may be
perturbed by a variety of growth-modulatory endogenous biogenic amines and exogenous chemicals, including drugs [11, 19]. overall, our ®ndings point to an

important role for cytochromes p450, and agents that
modulate their activity, in determining the response to,
and toxicities of, cancer chemotherapy.
