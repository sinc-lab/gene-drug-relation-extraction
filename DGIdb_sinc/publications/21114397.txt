pharmacology and cardiovascular tolerability
herbert lepor, m.d., and lawrence a. hill, pharm.d.
relief of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph)-related lower urinary tract
symptoms by ␣-blockers (␣1-adrenoceptor antagonists) is mediated primarily
through the blockade of ␣1a-receptors, leading to relaxation of smooth muscle
in the prostate and bladder neck. early ␣-blockers that were nonselective for
adrenoceptor subtypes have been associated with blood pressure–related
adverse effects, such as orthostatic hypotension, that may be attributed at least
in part to the blockade of ␣1b-adrenoceptors in arterial vessels.  xxxd3202xxx , a
novel ␣-blocker with exceptionally high selectivity for ␣1a- versus ␣1badrenoceptors, was recently approved in the united states for the treatment of
urinary symptoms related to bph. the unique receptor selectivity profile
likely accounts for some of the desirable clinical features of the drug.  xxxd3202xxx 
possesses an excellent cardiac- and blood pressure–related safety profile, and
data have demonstrated that it does not promote qt-interval prolongation.
therapeutic doses of  xxxd3202xxx  are safe for men with mild-to-moderate liver
dysfunction; dosage adjustment is recommended in those with moderate renal
impairment. the drug should not be taken with potent  xxxg590xxx 
inhibitors.  xxxd3202xxx  may be especially beneficial in patients who need to
maximize cardiovascular tolerability.
key words:  xxxd3202xxx , benign prostatic hyperplasia, bph, lower urinary tract

by aberrant proliferation of both stromal and
epithelial cells, causing progressive bladder outlet
obstruction. in severe cases, bladder outlet
obstruction may lead to acute or chronic urinary
retention.2 a common clinical manifestation of
bph is the occurrence of lower urinary tract
symptoms, which can often disrupt the patient’s
sleep and interfere with daily activities. ␣blockers (␣1-adrenoceptor antagonists) are a
well-established and effective treatment for bphrelated lower urinary tract symptoms and are
generally a first-line therapy in bph management.3
because symptom relief with ␣-blockers occurs
rapidly and is largely independent of prostate
volume, ␣-blockers remain the therapy of choice
for many men with bph.4
␣1 -adrenoreceptors include three receptor
subtypes—␣1a, ␣1b, and ␣1d—that are structurally
and pharmacologically distinct and have different
tissue distributions.5 ␣1a-adrenoceptors are the

pharmacotherapy volume 30, number 12, 2010

1304

predominant subtype in the human prostate,
where they mediate smooth muscle contraction.6,
7
a fourth subtype, ␣1l, also present in human
prostate, is derived from the same gene as ␣1a,
but ␣1l- and ␣1a-receptors have different pharmacologic properties and bind some ␣-blockers
with different affinities.8, 9 the precise structural
relationship between the two subtypes remains to
be elucidated.10 because few studies have used
assays that can distinguish between ␣1a- and ␣1lreceptors, reference to ␣ 1a in this review is
generally meant to include ␣1l-receptors.
relief of bph-related lower urinary tract
symptoms by ␣-blockers appears to be mediated
primarily by smooth muscle relaxation in the
prostate and bladder neck, resulting from the
blockade of ␣1a-receptors.5 although blockade
of ␣1d -receptors in the detrusor, in bladderafferent sensory pathways, and in the central
nervous system in the storage phase may be
functionally important for the therapeutic effects
of ␣-blockers,11 relaxation-mediating ␤3-adrenoceptors are by far the predominant adrenoceptor
subtype in the human bladder.12
␣1b-adrenoceptors are responsible at least in
part for arterial vasoconstriction, and the density
of ␣1b-adrenoceptors in arterial vessels increases
with age. 13, 14 consequently, blood pressure–
related adverse effects of some ␣-blockers, such
as orthostatic hypotension, have been attributed
in part to the blockade of vascular ␣1b-receptors.
because bph primarily affects older men,
minimizing the risk of blood pressure–related
adverse effects that are mediated by the blockade
of ␣1b-adrenoceptors is an important consideration in the development of new ␣-blockers.
 xxxd3202xxx  is a novel ␣-blocker with exceptionally
high selectivity for ␣1a- versus ␣1b-adrenoceptors.
the chemical name for  xxxd3202xxx  is 1-(3h y drox yprop yl)-5 -[ (2 r) -2-( { 2-[2-(2, 2 , 2 trifluoroethoxy)phenoxy]ethyl}amino)propyl]-2,3dihydro-1h-indole-7-carboxamide (figure 1).15

week, placebo-controlled, phase iii clinical
studies conducted in the united states
demonstrated that a therapeutic dose of  xxxd3202xxx 
8 mg once/day with breakfast provided rapid and
significant improvement in urinary symptoms
and peak flow rates in men with moderate-tosevere bph-related lower urinary tract symptoms
(table 1).16 in addition, the results of these trials
showed that  xxxd3202xxx  appeared to have an
excellent safety profile, including a low, placebolike occurrence of treatment-related orthostatic
hypotension.16, 17
preclinical pharmacology
because preclinical development of  xxxd3202xxx 
was conducted exclusively in japan, many
preclinical pharmacology studies have been
published in japanese-language journals. 18
recent studies relevant to  xxxd3202xxx  pharmacology
in humans have been conducted in the united
states, and these studies will be the primary
focus of this review.
early evidence for the high degree of ␣ 1 receptor subtype selectivity of  xxxd3202xxx  emerged
from competitive binding experiments using
[ 125 i]heat (2-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-[ 125 i]iodophenyl)ethylaminomethyl]-␣-tetralone) as a
ligand on membrane preparations from chinese
hamster ovary cells stably expressing recombinant
human ␣1 -adrenoceptors. 15 results of these
experiments show that the affinity of  xxxd3202xxx 
for human ␣1a-receptors was approximately 583
times that for human ␣1b-receptors and 56 times
that for human ␣ 1d -receptors. in contrast,
 xxxd3000xxx , a first-generation ␣-blocker used for
symptomatic treatment of bph, bound ␣1a- and
␣1b-receptors with similar affinities. consequently,

 xxxd3202xxx  for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia lepor and hill
binding affinities of  xxxd3202xxx  for ␣1a and ␣1b,
respectively, were approximately 5 times and one
tenth that of  xxxd3000xxx .
other recent competitive binding experiments
using membrane fractions from transfected
mouse lm (tk-) cells yielded ␣1a versus ␣1b selectivities for the ␣-blockers  xxxd3202xxx , tamsulosin,
and  xxxd3000xxx  of 162, 9.6, and 0.2, respectively.19
these findings were corroborated by competitive
binding experiments in which membrane
preparations from human prostate and aorta were
used. consistent with the tissue distribution of
␣ 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes, receptor binding
affinities of  xxxd3202xxx , tamsulosin, and  xxxd3000xxx 
for human prostate were 214, 8.3, and 0.3 times
those determined for human aorta, respectively.20
tissue selectivities observed in these binding
experiments corresponded well with those
determined by functional assays measuring
phenylephrine-induced contraction in rabbit and
human prostatic and arterial tissue. 20, 21
 xxxd3202xxx , tamsulosin, and  xxxd3000xxx , respectively,
were found to be 148, 2.6, and 0.2 times as
selective for human prostate as they were for
human mesenteric artery.20
the high degree of functional selectivity of
 xxxd3202xxx  for the lower urinary tract was further
demonstrated in animal models.22, 23 when injected
intravenously in decerebrate dogs,  xxxd3202xxx  and
tamsulosin had similar half-maximal inhibitory
concentration values for inhibition of phenylephrine-induced intraurethral pressure, but the
dose required to reduce mean blood pressure was
one order of magnitude higher for  xxxd3202xxx  than
for tamsulosin.23 furthermore, when administered
orally in rats,  xxxd3202xxx , compared with tamsulosin,
produced longer lasting inhibition of intraurethral
pressure.22
two studies separately investigated the in vivo
binding properties of  xxxd3202xxx  and tamsulosin in
rat tissue by using intravenous injection of
tritiated compounds. 24, 25 although total
exposures of the two ␣-blockers in the prostate
during the first 2 hours after injection were
similar, exposure of tamsulosin in the aorta was
4–6 times that of  xxxd3202xxx .25
clinical pharmacokinetics
 xxxd3202xxx  is quickly absorbed and has a
bioavailability of 32% at the therapeutic dose (8
mg/day). 26 after oral administration of 14clabeled  xxxd3202xxx , the recovery of radioactivity
after 10 days was approximately 33.5% in the
urine and 54.9% in the feces. 27 most of the

1305

 xxxd3202xxx  in the plasma (97%) is bound to
protein.27 it is extensively metabolized in the
liver, 28 with the two major metabolites in the
plasma being generated through glucuronidation
(kmd-3213g) or oxidation by alcohol and
aldehyde dehydrogenases (kmd-3293).
cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4, an important
enzyme in the metabolism of xenobiotics,
appears to be involved in the generation of a
number of metabolites of  xxxd3202xxx , all of which
are present in the plasma only at low concentrations. in contrast, kmd-3213g, which
accounts for only 2.4% of the recovered dose,
accumulates to high concentrations in the plasma
because it is highly hydrophilic and consequently
has low tissue penetration.
kmd-3213g is the only  xxxd3202xxx  metabolite
for which pharmacologic activity has been
demonstrated. its ability to inhibit norepinephrine-induced contraction of rat prostate
tissue has been shown to be approximately 50%
that of  xxxd3202xxx .29 however, understanding the
contribution of kmd-3213g to the overall
clinical effect of  xxxd3202xxx  also requires
consideration of its distinct pharmacokinetic
characteristics: this metabolite reaches exposure
levels in human plasma that are approximately 4
times greater than those of  xxxd3202xxx ,30 whereas
laboratory studies show that kmd-3213g is
distributed into rat prostate at approximately one
tenth the extent of  xxxd3202xxx .31 therefore, if the
prostate is the target organ and the findings from
the rat model are extrapolated to humans, this
metabolite may be contributing up to 20% of the
therapeutic effect of  xxxd3202xxx  in humans.
an analysis of single-dose administration
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3202xxx  in young healthy
adults revealed a linear dose dependency of both
maximum concentration and exposure for oral
doses up to 12 mg/day—the highest dose
administered.28 in addition, the  xxxd3202xxx  steadystate pharmacokinetics in adult male subjects
was linear over a range of 0.1–24 mg/day.27 a
study in the united states in 19 healthy men
aged 45–71 years evaluated the steady-state
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3202xxx  8 mg/day and its
major metabolites (figure 2) after 7 days of
dosing.30 maximum plasma concentrations for
 xxxd3202xxx  were reached on average 2.6 hours after
dosing.26, 30 mean plasma half-life for  xxxd3202xxx 
was 13 hours. 30 maximum plasma concentrations of kmd-3213g were reached approximately 5.5 hours after dosing, and mean total
plasma exposure of kmd-3213g (area under the
concentration-time curve from 0–24 hrs

[auc0–24] 1660 ng•hr/ml) was 4.5 times that of
 xxxd3202xxx  (auc 0–24 373 ng•hr/ml). also, in
comparison with  xxxd3202xxx , kmd-3213g had an
extended plasma half-life (~24 hrs).30 mean total
plasma exposure (auc0–24 373 ng•hr/ml) and
mean half-life (13 hrs) for kmd-3293 were very
similar to the corresponding values for
 xxxd3202xxx .27, 30 results of this study suggest that
men with bph who receive therapeutic doses of
 xxxd3202xxx  should be expected to have substantially higher plasma exposure of kmd-3213g
than  xxxd3202xxx  exposure. as discussed previously,
however, its potential for pharmacologic activity
is lower than that of  xxxd3202xxx .
because of the involvement of the cyp3a4
pathway in the metabolism of  xxxd3202xxx , a recent

u.s. study evaluated the effects of ketoconazole,
a potent inhibitor of cyp3a4, on single-dose
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3202xxx  and its major
metabolites.32 in this open-label, randomizedsequence, crossover study, a single dose of
 xxxd3202xxx  8 mg was administered to 22 healthy
men on the second day of a 4-day regimen of
ketoconazole 400 mg/day or placebo (figure 3).
ketoconazole plus  xxxd3202xxx , compared with
 xxxd3202xxx  alone, increased the mean maximum
concentration and total exposure of  xxxd3202xxx  in
the plasma by factors of 3.7 and 3.1, respectively.
similarly, mean maximum concentration and
total exposure for kmd-3213g increased 3.2-fold
and 3.0-fold, respectively. on the basis of these
findings, daily coadministration of ketoconazole
and the therapeutic dose of  xxxd3202xxx  would be
expected to result in substantially elevated
steady-state plasma concentrations of  xxxd3202xxx 
and its metabolites, thereby increasing the
potential for  xxxd3202xxx -related adverse effects.
consequently, concurrent use of  xxxd3202xxx  and
potent cyp3a4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole,
clarithromycin, itraconazole, and ritonavir, is
contraindicated.27
in contrast to coadministration of ketoconazole,
moderate liver dysfunction had only a small
effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile
of  xxxd3202xxx , and dosage adjustments for
 xxxd3202xxx  in patients with bph with mild-tomoderate liver dysfunction are not necessary.27
in an open-label, two-period, crossover u.s.
study, nine men with moderate liver dysfunction
(child-pugh score 7–9) and nine men with
normal liver function received single doses of
 xxxd3202xxx  4 and 8 mg during two separate

evaluation periods.33 moderate liver dysfunction
resulted in a modest reduction in mean
maximum concentrations and total exposures of
both major metabolites of  xxxd3202xxx  in the
plasma. however, liver dysfunction was not
associated with substantial changes in mean
plasma exposure of  xxxd3202xxx . after administration of the therapeutic dose of 8 mg, mean
exposure for unbound  xxxd3202xxx  in patients with
liver dysfunction was approximately 20% higher.
mean maximum unbound plasma concentration
of  xxxd3202xxx  in subjects with liver dysfunction
was elevated by about 12%.33 the apparent lack
of a substantial effect of liver dysfunction on
 xxxd3202xxx  pharmacokinetics may be explained in
part by the substantial compensatory increase in
renal clearance observed in men with liver
dysfunction.
the effect of renal impairment on single-dose
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3202xxx  4 mg and its
metabolites was evaluated in a japanese study of
13 men aged 20–75 years. 26, 28 six of those
subjects had moderate-to-severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 11–50 ml/min) and
seven had normal renal function (creatinine
clearance ≥ 91 ml/min). after a single 4-mg dose
of  xxxd3202xxx , mean maximum plasma concentration of  xxxd3202xxx  and mean total exposure both
increased more than 3-fold in subjects with renal
impairment compared with corresponding values
in healthy subjects. of note, total exposures of
the main metabolites increased by factors of 3.8
and 2.9, respectively. however, the effect of renal
impairment on exposures of unbound moieties
was more moderate. mean unbound exposures
of  xxxd3202xxx , kmd-3293, and kmd-3213g
increased by factors of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.7,
respectively, in subjects with renal impairment
compared with healthy subjects. renal
impairment also resulted in approximately 2-fold
increases in the elimination half-lives of  xxxd3202xxx 
and its major metabolites. further analysis
indicated that these increases in total plasma
concentrations of  xxxd3202xxx  and its metabolites
were proportionate to increases in the concentration of ␣1-glycoprotein observed in patients
with renal impairment, with a resulting ability of
the plasma to bind  xxxd3202xxx .26, 28
a post hoc analysis of data from a u.s. phase
iii study was conducted to compare the steadystate plasma concentrations of  xxxd3202xxx  8 mg/day
and its metabolites in 233 patients with bph with
no (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min), mild
(creatinine clearance of 50–80 ml/min), or
moderate (creatinine clearance of 30 to < 50

ml/min) renal impairment. 34 mild renal
impairment had no discernible effect on the
steady-state concentrations of any of the three
moieties. however, after 4 weeks of treatment
with  xxxd3202xxx  8 mg/day, mean plasma
concentrations of all three compounds were
slightly higher in patients with moderate renal
impairment than they were in those with no or
mild renal impairment (figure 4).34
on the basis of available data regarding the
effects of renal impairment on  xxxd3202xxx 
pharmacokinetics, a recommendation for dose
reduction from 8 mg/day to 4 mg/day in patients
with bph with moderate renal impairment has
been included in the prescribing information.27
however, because the safety of  xxxd3202xxx  in
patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine
clearance < 30 ml/min) has not been evaluated,
 xxxd3202xxx  is contraindicated in those patients.27
general tolerability and cardiovascular safety
second- and third-generation ␣-blockers for
the treatment of bph-related symptoms generally
are safe and well tolerated.3 however, cardiovascular safety and tolerability of ␣-blockers for
certain patients remain a matter of primary
concern due to the potential of some ␣-blockers
to interfere with blood pressure regulation. in
two 12-week, placebo-controlled, phase iii
studies of  xxxd3202xxx , the rates of adverse events
among 923 patients receiving  xxxd3202xxx  were
3.2% or lower, except for retrograde ejaculation
(table 2). 16 the only cardiovascular adverse
events occurring in more than 2% of patients
who received  xxxd3202xxx  were dizziness, orthostatic
hypotension, and headache; the only other
adverse events in more than 2% were retrograde

ejaculation, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and nasal
congestion.
during a 9-month open-label extension of the
two phase iii studies, the only adverse events
experienced by at least 3% of the study population (661 patients) were retrograde ejaculation
(20.9%), diarrhea (4.1%), and nasopharyngitis
(3.6%). 35 the high frequency of retrograde
ejaculation observed for  xxxd3202xxx  likely is a
consequence of the high receptor selectivity of
 xxxd3202xxx  for ␣1a-adrenoceptors. a retrospective
responder analysis of the phase iii study data
suggests that patients who experienced
retrograde ejaculation were likely to achieve
greater symptom improvement than those who
did not experience this adverse effect.36
dose-dependent rates of retrograde ejaculation
of up to 18% have been reported for the
moderately ␣1a-selective ␣-blocker tamsulosin
(0.4 and 0.8 mg/day) in two 13-week, placebocontrolled, phase iii studies in the united
states.37, 38 a recent placebo-controlled phase iii
study in japanese men with bph compared the
efficacy and safety of  xxxd3202xxx  8 mg/day and
tamsulosin 0.2 mg/day. 39 both drugs were
associated with placebo-like frequencies of
dizziness and diarrhea, but the percentage of
patients who experienced retrograde ejaculation
was substantially higher for  xxxd3202xxx  (22.3%)
than for tamsulosin (1.6%), and  xxxd3202xxx 
provided significantly greater symptom
improvement than tamsulosin after 2 weeks of
treatment. however, it is important to emphasize
that the results of the japanese study should not
be extrapolated to patients in the united states
because tamsulosin 0.2 mg/day represents only
one quarter to one half of the clinically recommended dosage in the united states (0.4–0.8
mg/day).
a recent meta-analysis of the vascular-related
safety profile of ␣-blockers used for the
symptomatic treatment of patients with bph
found a statistically significant increase in the
risk of developing vascular-related adverse events
with alfuzosin, terazosin, and doxazosin.40 a
thorough preclinical evaluation of the cardiovascular effects of a single dose of  xxxd3202xxx  was
conducted in conscious male dogs using a wide
range of dose levels (0.2–20 mg/kg). 41 the
lowest dose (0.2 mg/kg) was approximately 8
times higher than the pharmacologically active
dose (0.026 mg/kg), defined as the dose needed
to obtain 50% inhibition of intraurethral pressure
induced by hypogastric nerve stimulation.41 at

a positive test was defined as postural change from supine to standing resulting in a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 30 mm hg, a
decrease in diastolic blood pressure > 20 mm hg, an increase in heart rate > 20 beats/min, or orthostatic symptoms (lightheadedness,
dizziness, blurring or temporary loss of vision, profound weakness, or syncope).

(table 3). 43 this study generally found no
clinically significant effects of maximum therapeutic doses of sildenafil or tadalafil, compared
with placebo, on heart rate and orthostatic blood
pressure, when coadministered with  xxxd3202xxx .
recently, in vitro and clinical data raised the
possibility that at least some patients taking the
␣-blocker alfuzosin might be at increased risk for
developing delayed myocardial repolarization, as
determined by heart rate–corrected qt (qtc)interval prolongation on ecg. 44, 45 because
delayed myocardial repolarization can lead to
lethal polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias,
in 2005, the u.s. food and drug administration
(fda) recommended that all new drugs with
systemic exposure submitted for marketing
approval be evaluated for effects on qtc interval

placebo-corrected qtcl interval (msec)

cantly decreased mean and diastolic but not
systolic blood pressure 1 hour after administration. at the highest dose (20 mg/kg), significant decreases of up to about 20% in mean,
systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were
observed over a period of 8 hours after administration of these supratherapeutic doses.
the cardiovascular safety of  xxxd3202xxx  was also
evaluated in a placebo-controlled, dose-escalation
study conducted in healthy men aged 19–45
years to determine the maximum tolerated
dose.26 study participants, who received 3-day
regimens of supratherapeutic doses ranging from
16–48 mg/day, were monitored for changes in
orthostatic blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (ecg) parameters.26, 42 results of
orthostatic tests showed a positive correlation
between  xxxd3202xxx  dose and maximum observed
changes from baseline for systolic blood pressure,
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. in
addition, the frequency of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, the most common adverse
event, was higher for the 16-mg dose (compared
with placebo) and continued to increase with
increasing doses. other adverse events that may
be related to blood pressure, such as headache
and dizziness, were very rare.26 the frequency of
tachycardia, the second most common adverse
event, was dose dependent and was consistently
higher for  xxxd3202xxx  than for placebo at these
high doses.26, 42 although supratherapeutic doses
of  xxxd3202xxx  clearly increased the frequencies of
orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia in a
dose-dependent manner, overall effects were
modest even at such doses.
the generally favorable blood pressure–related
tolerability of  xxxd3202xxx  was also confirmed by a
recent study in 24 healthy men aged 45–78 years
that evaluated the pharmacodynamic interaction
of  xxxd3202xxx  with the phosphodiesterase-5
inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil, which are
commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction

in a thorough qt/qtc study.46
in accordance with fda recommendations, a
thorough qt/qtc study of  xxxd3202xxx  was
conducted in 186 healthy men.47 this placebocontrolled study evaluated the effects of
therapeutic (8 mg/day) and supratherapeutic (24
mg/day) doses on individually corrected qtc
(qtci) intervals, using moxifloxacin, an agent
known to promote mild qt-interval prolongation,
as a positive control to ensure sufficient assay
sensitivity. results demonstrated that subjects
treated for 5 days with triple the therapeutic dose
of  xxxd3202xxx  experienced no statistically or
clinically significant qtci-interval prolongation
over a period of 24 hours after the last dose
(figure 5). in addition, no clinically meaningful
effects on other ecg parameters were observed.
when  xxxd3202xxx  plasma concentrations in individual subjects were compared with timematched changes from baseline in qtci interval,
no statistically significant or clinically meaningful correlation was observed. given the size of
the study, the number of subjects with treatmentrelated orthostatic hypotension or headache
overall was small. the number of affected
subjects was slightly higher for the supratherapeutic dose (orthostatic hypotension in 4/45
patients and headache in 6/45 patients) than for
placebo (2/46 patients and 3/46 patients,
respectively), but similar for placebo and the
therapeutic dose of  xxxd3202xxx  (2/48 patients and
4/48 patients, respectively). thus, the results of
this thorough qt/qtc study in healthy volunteers suggest that even supratherapeutic doses of
 xxxd3202xxx  are unlikely to promote clinically
significant qt-interval prolongation. consistent
with the findings of this qt/qtc study,47 the 12week phase iii studies16 and the 9-month openlabel extension study35 of  xxxd3202xxx  reported no
cases of qt-interval prolongation or any other
cardiac adverse event.
conclusion
results of in vitro and in vivo binding studies
and of functional studies with human tissue and
animal models have demonstrated that  xxxd3202xxx 
is a novel selective ␣-blocker, with exceptionally
high selectivity for ␣1a-adrenoceptors located in
the prostate versus ␣1b-adrenoceptors located in
vascular tissue, and moderate selectivity for ␣1aversus ␣1d-adrenoceptors found in the bladder,
nasal passages, and central nervous system. this
unique receptor selectivity profile likely accounts
for at least some of the desirable clinical features

of  xxxd3202xxx . consistent with observed tissue
selectivity, clinical studies both in healthy volunteers and in patients with bph have provided
evidence of an excellent cardiac- and blood
pressure–related safety profile for  xxxd3202xxx ,
including the demonstration in a thorough
qt/qtc study that  xxxd3202xxx , even at triple the
therapeutic dose, did not promote qt-interval
prolongation. therapeutic doses of  xxxd3202xxx  are
safe for men with mild-to-moderate liver dysfunction, but dosage adjustment is recommended
in those with moderate renal impairment.
 xxxd3202xxx  should not be taken with potent
cyp3a4 inhibitors. available pharmacologic and
clinical evidence suggests that  xxxd3202xxx  is a
novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of bphrelated lower urinary tract symptoms that may be
especially beneficial for patients who need to
maximize cardiovascular tolerability.  xxxd3202xxx 
also had minimal effects on blood pressure in a
small study in healthy volunteers.
