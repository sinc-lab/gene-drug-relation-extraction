abstract enhancing neural transmission by improving axonal
conduction and synaptic neurotransmitter release is a novel
strategy to improve symptoms in multiple sclerosis.  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx  extended-release) is a first-in-class
medication that targets the damaged nervous system through
blockage of voltage-gated potassium channels. through a series of clinical trials,  xxxd1804xxx  (dosed  xxxd1891xxx  mg twice daily)
has been found to improve walking speed by approximately
25 % on average in one third of individuals with multiple
sclerosis regardless of disease stage. furthermore, it significantly improves patients' perception of their ambulatory disability
and may improve lower extremity strength. given the mechanism of action, the most serious adverse effect is its proconvulsant property, which occurs more frequently at high
serum concentrations. the most common adverse events include increased falls, urinary tract infections, dizziness, insomnia, and headaches. despite these potential side-effects, the vast
majority of individuals who derive benefit continue on the
treatment. the exact mechanism of action is uncertain, as is
the reason for response variability. the medication serves as
proof-of-concept that targeting axonal transmission can improve disability in multiple sclerosis.

introduction
multiple sclerosis (ms) is the most common disease of the
central nervous system in young adults leading to sustained
disability. a wide variety of deficits contribute to disability,
including visual disturbances, weakness, ataxia, and gait
dysfunction, fatigue, bladder and bowel difficulties, and
cognitive dysfunction. the disease involves immunemediated destruction of the central nervous system myelin,
as well as a variable amount of direct axonal injury. although the underlying mechanism of disability progression
remains uncertain, inflammatory demyelination is likely a
significant contributor, as it leads to slowed conduction
velocity along affected axons. current disease-modifying
therapies target the heightened immune response, but do
not directly target the damaged nervous system.
 xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx  extended-release;
termed  xxxd1804xxx  sustained-release in pre-2010 literature
and outside the united states) is a novel therapy that directly
targets demyelinated axons presumably by improving conduction and facilitating synaptic transmission.  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx ) is a broad-spectrum antagonist of voltage-gated
potassium (kv) channels [1, 2]. the compound has been
previously studied for spinal cord injury, neuromuscular
junction disorders, and alzheimer’s disease [3, 4]. a related
compound 3,4 diaminopyridine has also been studied in
ms, as well as neuromuscular disease, most notably
lambert-eaton syndrome [5].
primarily based on 2 phase 3 randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trials,  xxxd1804xxx  has been shown to
improve walking speed on the timed 25-foot walk (t25fw)
test by approximately 25 % on average in one third of
subjects [6, 7] gait dysfunction is 1 of the leading causes
of physical disability among patients with ms. recently
diagnosed patients with relapsing-remitting ms can have
reduced walking speed and stride length, as well as balance
impairment, suggesting that the process leading to gait

 xxxd1804xxx  therapy

dysfunction frequently begins early in the disease [8]. overall, approximately 75 % of ms patients struggle with mobility problems leading to loss of independence, physical
appearance of disability, and unemployment [9]. as such,
gait dysfunction contributes significantly to reduced quality
of life [10, 11]. thus, improving mobility through enhanced
neural transmission, in addition to targeting inflammatory
demyelination, can lead to enhancement of quality of life for
ms patients.

mechanism of action
demyelination of central axons leads to exposure of the
paranodal and juxtaparanodal regions (areas immediately
adjacent to the nodes of ranvier). these axonal regions
are rich in kv channels. it is theorized that exposure of
these channels in demyelinated axons contributes significantly to dysfunction of action potential propagation as it
causes the cell to move closer to voltage equilibrium for
potassium [1]. in addition, exposure of slow kv channels
impairs axonal generation of repetitive impulses by interfering with hyperpolarization [12].  xxxd1804xxx  also increases presynaptic transmission by increasing end-terminal influx of
calcium [13]. this may be due to the indirect effect of kv
blockage on calcium influx or direct effects of  xxxd1804xxx  on
voltage-gated calcium channels, thereby increasing cytoplasmic free calcium [14–16].
remyelination of damaged axons depends on proliferation of oligodendrocytes. the oligodendrocytes originate
from oligodentrocyte precursor cells (opc), and thus opc
proliferation is likely to be important in recovery from
relapses. there is evidence that certain kv channel subtypes
play a role in opc proliferation, and thus blockage could
hypothetically help facilitate remyelination [17, 18].  xxxd1804xxx 
could also have an immunomodulatory role as immune cells
(e.g., t and b cells, microglia, and macrophages) also express kv channels. furthermore, the number of kv channels
is significantly upregulated when these cells are activated
and seem to play a role in activation and proliferation [14,
19, 20].

pharmacology and pharmacokinetics
the kv channel has 4 alpha subunits, each containing 6
membrane-spanning, alpha-helical regions. the subunits
form pores that are either homotetramers or heterotetramers
[1].  xxxd1804xxx  is a broad-spectrum kv channel-blocking agent
that has the greatest affinity for slowly inactivating channels. it is part of a family of monoamino and diamino
pyridine derivatives, where there is an amino substitution
in the fourth position of the pyridine ring [1, 12].  xxxd1804xxx  is a

107

small, lipid soluble, and readily crosses the blood brain
barrier.  xxxd1804xxx  binds to the kv channel from the cytoplasmic
side at the opening of the pore, thus occluding it [1].
early studies of  xxxd1804xxx  showed an increase in action potential duration and amplitude when measured on experimentally demyelinated mammalian peripheral nerve fibers
[21, 22]. small human clinical trials using intravenous and
orally administered immediate-release formulations of  xxxd1804xxx 
were subsequently completed in ms and spinal cord injury
[23–28]. pharmacologic trials have shown that immediaterelease  xxxd1804xxx  has a mean time to maximum concentration of
1 h and a mean half-life of 3.5 h. the maximum observed
plasma concentration for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses were
46.4 and >100 ng/ml, respectively. the peak serum concentration was clearly dose related and followed a linear
distribution [2]. the medication is primarily excreted renally
with a total urinary excretion of 99 % after 24 h. it has
negligible protein binding and limited conversion to metabolites [29, 30].
immediate-release formulations of  xxxd1804xxx  were found to
have a narrow therapeutic window, with higher concentrations acting as a proconvulsant [31]. this finding, along
with the need for frequent dosing throughout the day, motivated creation of an extended-release formulation (initially
entitled sustained-release). this extended-release formulation has a mean time to maximum concentration of 3.2 to 5 h
and a mean half-life of 5.2 to 6.4 h. the maximum observed
plasma concentration for the 10 mg dose was 22 ng/ml
(50 % lower than the immediate release formulation) [29,
30]. thus, the sustained-release formulation had lower peak
concentrations, and could be dosed less frequently. it is
important to note, that in the setting of moderate-to-severe
renal impairment (i.e., creatinine clearance, <40 ml/min),
peak plasma concentration was 1.5 to 2 times higher with
time to maximum concentration of 6 to 8 h and a half-life of
8 to 14 h [29].

clinical trials
for the last 30 years, small safety and efficacy trials of  xxxd1804xxx 
were completed in ms patients. initial studies showed improvement in visual performance, motor function, coordination, gait, and oculomotor function. no serious adverse
effects were identified in these early studies [32, 33]. in
1994, bever et al. [34] published a randomized, placebocontrolled trial testing the immediate-release formulation of
 xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx ). the trial documented an improvement in
visual contrast-sensitivity and strength, but did not find a
significant difference in expanded disability status scale
scores. serum concentrations >60 ng/ml were associated
with a higher incidence of adverse events. one subject had a
generalized tonic-clonic seizure at a concentration of

108

104 ng/ml, and another had an acute confusional episode at
114 ng/ml.
schwid et al. [35] published a small, double blind, placebocontrolled crossover study of  xxxd1804xxx  ( xxxd1804xxx  sustained
release) in 1997 that helped identify walking speed as an
outcome of interest. they used a dose of 17.5 mg twice daily
for 1 week. the study found improvement in timed gait and
nonsignificant improvement in timed stair climbing, grip
strength, or expanded disability status scale. importantly, no
serious adverse events were documented. in 2007 and 2008,
goodman et al. [36, 37] published 2 randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled dose trials of  xxxd1804xxx ; the first trial
assessed the safety and efficacy of dose escalation, and the
second trial compared parallel groups of 3 doses. the latter trial
found an increase in baseline lower extremity strength in the 3drug treatment groups, but found that serious adverse events
were more common in the higher-dosed groups. in the initial
study, 2 subjects had convulsions at 30 to 35 mg twice daily
dosing. in the latter study, 2 subjects experienced seizures, and
1 had encephalopathy in the 20 mg group.
these preliminary studies informed the design of the first
phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial
[6]. this study evaluated  xxxd1804xxx  (10 mg twice daily
dosing) for 14 weeks versus a placebo in 301 subjects. the
mean peak  xxxd1804xxx  concentration was 27.6 ng/ml. in
the  xxxd1804xxx  group, there were 35 % of subjects versus
8 % in the placebo group who were deemed “timed walk
responders.” responders were defined as patients who had a
faster walking speed on the t25fw for at least 3 of 4 visits
during the double-blind treatment period compared with
their maximum speed for any of the 5 off-drug visits. mean
improvement of walking speed in responders was 25 %
versus 5 % in the placebo group. this improvement was
maintained during the 14-week treatment period. this study
also used the 12-item ms walking scale, which evaluates a
subject’s perception of their ambulatory disability (with a
lower score correlating with a lower perceived disability).
the change in score had significantly improved in the
responder group (-6.84 vs 0.05 in the nonresponders). this
was an important observation as it supported the conclusion
that the improvement in walking speed to be not only
statistically, but also clinically, relevant [6]. a recent report
evaluated what change in the t25fw would statistically be
considered “minimally important,” and found the estimate to
be around 20 % [38]. the trial also assessed clinical global
impression scores as well as lower extremity strength, which
were significantly improved in responders [6].
goodman et al. [7] published the results of the second
phase 3 trial in 2010. the study evaluated  xxxd1804xxx 
10 mg twice daily dosing for 9 weeks versus placebo in 239
subjects. the mean peak  xxxd1804xxx  concentration was
28.5-30.2 ng/ml. 43 % of subjects in the  xxxd1804xxx  group
were found to be treatment responders (vs 9 % in the placebo

improvement in a measure of lower extremity strength [7].

safety
the most severe adverse events identified by trials have been
seizures and acute encephalopathy. these seem to occur with
high serum concentrations of the medication (>100 ng/ml),
and were more common with the immediate-release formulation [4]. the theorized mechanism for its proconvulsant effect
is increased neuronal excitability from  xxxg1232xxx 
blockade. when estimating the increased seizure risk

associated with the medication, 1 must account for the overall
increased incidence of seizures in the ms population (2 % vs
1 % in the general population) [39]. in an initial study by
bever et al. [34] on immediate-release  xxxd1804xxx , 1 patient had a
generalized-tonic clonic seizure with a serum concentration of
104 ng/ml [4]. in the  xxxd1804xxx  dose ranging trials by
goodman [36], 2 patients had seizures in each study on doses
ranging from 20 to 35 mg [36, 37]. in the phase 3 pivotal trials,
only 1 seizure occurred in the initial study, but it was associated with sepsis secondary to community-acquired pneumonia
[6]. there have been reports of toxicity related to pharmacies
independently compounding an immediate-release formulation of the medication. a concern is that these preparations
may not always meet uniformity requirements [31]. overall, it
seems that when the extended-release preparation is used at
the appropriate dosage (10 mg twice daily), the incidence of
seizures is no higher than that of the ms population as a
whole. however, given the risk for seizures at higher serum
concentrations, the medication should be avoided in those
with a history of seizures or renal dysfunction.
other serious adverse events occurring on treatment (although not clearly related to the medication) have been
severe anxiety, sepsis (secondary to community-acquired
pneumonia), cellulitis, pyelonephritis, patellar fracture, coronary artery disease, and cholelithiasis. the most common
adverse effects are summarized in table 2, and these include
increased frequency of falls, urinary tract infections, insomnia, dizziness, and headache. less frequently encountered
adverse effects have included fatigue, nausea, upper respiratory infections, asthenia, back pain, balance dysfunction,
arthralgia, and paresthesias [6, 7]. there is no indication that
the medication increases the incidence of ms relapses.
there is no indication of cardiotoxicity at standard doses,
although there are reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients
taking unregulated formulations [31]. data from open-label
extension studies show no new long-term safety concerns
and 73 % continued usage as of 2008 [40].
as previously described, the medication is excreted via the
kidneys, and thus patients with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency have 1.5 to 2 times higher peak serum concentrations [29]. caution should be used in patients with mild
renal impairment (creatinine clearance, 51-80 ml/min), but no
specific dose adjustment is recommended. the medication
should be avoided in patients with moderate-to-severe renal
impairment (creatinine clearance, <51 ml/min).

conclusion and future directions
 xxxd1804xxx  is a unique treatment that is believed to work
by improving axonal conduction and facilitating synaptic
transmission. it significantly increases walking speed in
approximately one third of individuals, which can help

109

improve independence, employment opportunity, and ultimately quality of life. seizure is the adverse event of most
concern, but when used at standard dosing, the incidence is
not likely higher than that of the general ms population.
it is unclear why some patients (30-40 %) are treatment
responders and others are not. it has been proposed that
lesion location may influence response to treatment. responders may have demyelinated axons more relevant to gait,
and thus they are more likely to have benefit from treatment.
however, the subjects included in each pivotal trial had
t25fw for >8 seconds, and so it is likely that the majority
of patients had demyelinating lesions relevant to ambulation. the discrepancy could involve individual polymorphisms of voltage-gated potassium channels rendering
specific channels more or less susceptible to the medication.
future studies to evaluate the cause of the discrepancy may
allow identification of potential responders.
 xxxd1804xxx  serves as proof-of-concept that targeting
the damaged nervous system can improve symptoms. alternate mechanisms for enhancing axonal conduction should
be sought. if treatments are developed with such varied
mechanisms, significant symptomatic improvement could
potentially be achieved through combination therapies.
