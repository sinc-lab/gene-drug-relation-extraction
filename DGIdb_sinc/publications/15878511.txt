abstract
racemic and enantiomerically pure ((s,s) and (r,r)) 2-[a-(2-(2-[18f]fluoroethoxy)phenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ([18f]frb) and its
tetradeuterated form [18f]frb-d4, analogs of the highly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor  xxxd3089xxx  (2-[a-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)
benzyl]morpholine, rb), have been synthesized for studies of  xxxg2148xxx  (net) system with positron emission tomography
(pet). the [18f]fluorinated precursor, (s,s)/(r,r)-n-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-2-[a-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ((s,s)/(r,r)-nboc-desethylrb), was prepared by the n-protection of (s,s)/(r,r)-2-[a-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ((s,s)/(r,r)-desethylrb)
with a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (boc) group followed by enantiomeric resolution with chiral hplc to provide both (s,s) and (r,r) enantiomers
with n 99% enantiomeric purity. these compounds were then used for radiosynthesis to prepare enantiomerically pure [18f]frb and
[18f]frb-d4 via the following three-step procedure: (1) formation of 1-bromo-2-[18f]fluoroethane ([18f]bfe or [18f]bfe-d4) by
nucleophilic displacement of 2-bromoethyl triflate (or d4 analog) with no-carrier added [18f]f in thf; (2) reaction of [18f]bfe (or
[18f]bfe-d4) with n-boc-desethylrb in dmf in the presence of excess base; and (3) deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid. the racemates,
(s,s) and (r,r) enantiomers of [18f]frb and [18f]frb-d4 were obtained in 11–27% (decay corrected to the end of bombardment, eob) in
120-min synthesis time with a radiochemical purity of n 98% and specific activities of 21–48 gbq/amol (eob). the results of the wholebody biodistribution studies with (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 were similar to those with (s,s)-[18f]frb but showed relatively faster blood clearance
and no significant in vivo defluorination. positron emission tomography studies in baboon brain also showed that (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 may be
a potentially useful ligand for imaging net with pet.

1. introduction
the  xxxg2148xxx  (net), the dopamine
transporter (dat) and the serotonin transporter (sert) are
all involved in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, and have been molecular targets for the treatment of
depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd),
drug addiction and eating disorders [1]. however, while
research on dopamine and serotonin systems related to cns
disorders has benefited from the availability of a number of
suitable radioligands [2], less effort has been contributed to
the development of net radioligands, and the progress
leading to useful net radioligands has just been made

recently. haka and kilbourn [3] reported the synthesis of
[11c]nisoxetine that showed significant binding to the
net-rich tissue in mouse brain; however, its high nonspecific binding precluded its practical application as a net
radiotracer. van dort et al. [4] reported the synthesis of
11
c-labeled desipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine, but the
in vivo evaluation was not included. mcconathy et al. [5]
reported the preparation of [11c]talopram and [11c]talsupram. although both compounds displayed high affinity and
selectivity for the human net in vitro, the biodistribution
studies in rats showed that the brain uptake of these two
c-11-labeled tracers was low, which diminished their
potential application for imaging brain net.
 xxxd3089xxx  (rb, fig. 1), a potent and selective
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [6,7], has been marketed
as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (s,s) and (r,r),

a sert radioligand with a [18f]fluoroethyl group has also
been reported [17]. therefore, it is conceivable that
replacing the [18f]fluoromethyl moiety of [18f]fmener
with a [18f]fluoroethyl group would further reduce the
extent of in vivo defluorination, while the resulting
[18f]frb, which is an analog of rb, would retain the high
affinity and selectivity toward net.
in order to explore the deuterium isotope effect, we
have also synthesized tetradeuterated f-18-labeled frb
([18f]frb-d4) to carry out comparative studies. in this
article, we report (1) the preparation of frb and the
[18f]fluorinated precursor, n-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-2-[a-(2hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine (n-boc-desethylrb,
fig. 1); (2) chiral separation of enantiomers of frb
and n-boc-desethylrb; (3) preparation of racemic and
individual enantiomers ((s,s) and (r,r)) of [18f]frb and
its tetradeuterated analog, [18f]frb-d4 (fig. 1); and (4)
whole-body biodistribution in mice with (s,s)-[18f]frb and
(s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 for comparison of the extent of in vivo
defluorination. results of pet studies of these f-18-labeled
analogs in baboon brain will be published separately.

under the brand name  xxxd3089xxx , for the treatment of
depressive illness in several european countries, and is
currently under clinical trials for the treatment of adhd in
adults [8] and cocaine dependence [9]. (s,s)-rb has been
shown to be over 20 times more potent than (r,r)-rb
[10], which makes it an attractive model compound for the
design of radiotracers for imaging net in vivo. recently,
wilson et al. [11], schou et al. [12] and our group [13,14]
reported the synthesis of 11c-labeled (s,s)-2-[a-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ((s,s)-mrb, fig. 1), the
methyl analog of (s,s)-rb, and demonstrated its potential
value as a net radioligand in rat, monkey and baboon,
respectively, with positron emission tomography (pet). it
was also our interest to develop an f-18-labeled analog.
while we were in the process of developing an f-18-labeled
analog of rb ([18f]frb), schou et al. [15] also developed
an f-18-labeled mrb analog, (s,s)-2-[a-(2-[18f]fluoromethoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine ((s,s)-[18f]fmener,
fig. 1). (s,s)-[18f]fmener showed significant specific
binding to the net-rich regions in monkey brain; however,
high bone uptake of radioactivity was observed after
injection, possibly due to in vivo defluorination. a dideuterated (s,s)-[18f]fmener analog, (s,s)-[18f]fmener-d2
[15] (fig. 1), was then developed with the intention of
reducing in vivo defluorination. the extent of defluorination
was significantly reduced, though not totally inhibited as
shown by the continuous increase of bone uptake from their
pet studies.
it has been shown in the case of 18f-labeled benzodiazepine receptor radioligands [16] that the extent of bone
uptake from an aryl [18f]fluoromethyl ether was reduced by
over 98% when a [18f]fluoromethyl moiety was replaced by
a [18f]fluoroethyl group. in addition, the reduction of bone
uptake by the replacement of a [18f]fluoromethyl moiety of

published procedures [13]. 2-fluoroethyl tosylate [18] and
2-bromoethyl triflate(-d4) [19] were prepared according to
literature procedures. the synthetic pathway for preparation
of the [18f]fluorinated precursor ((s,s)/(r,r)-n-boc-desethylrb) and the reference compound ((s,s)/(r,r)-frb) is
shown in scheme 1. the radiosyntheses of f-18-labeled
racemic frb and its individual enantiomers were conducted
via [18f]fluoroethylation as shown in scheme 2. all
chemicals were purchased from the aldrich (milwaukee,
wi) and were used as received without further purification.

apparatus (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa) and are uncorrected. all nmr spectra were recorded in cdcl3 solution

downfield from internal tetramethylsilane. the central peak
of cdcl3 signal at 77.0 ppm was used as the 13c nmr
reference. high-resolution mass spectrometry (hrms)
experiments were performed at ucr mass spectrometry
facility (riverside, ca) on a vg 7070 or vg-zab highresolution mass spectrometer. radioactivity was measured in
a capintec crc-712mv radioisotope calibrator (capintec,
ramsey, nj). male swiss webster mice were purchased from
taconic (germantown, ny). 18f activity of tissues from
biodistribution studies was counted on a packard minaxi g
5000 automated gamma counter (packard instrument, meriden, ct). no-carrier-added [18f]fluoride ion was produced
by the bnl jsw 1710 cyclotron via the 18o( p,n)18f nuclear
reaction on 18o-enriched water.
2.2. syntheses
2.2.1. (s,s)/(r,r)-n-boc-desethylrb 2
a mixture of desethylrb 1 (285 mg, 1 mmol),
di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (218 mg, 1 mmol) and sodium
bicarbonate (252 mg, 3 mmol) in methanol (5 ml) was
stirred at ambient temperature for 48 h. after removing the
solvent under reduced pressure, water (30 ml) was added to
the residue. the solution was cooled in an ice/water bath
and acidified to ph 2 with saturated khso4 aqueous
solution. the solution was then extracted with ether
(330 ml). the combined ether fractions were washed with
water (30 ml), dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated
under reduced pressure. the residue was purified by
chromatography on silica gel eluting with 60:40 hexane/
ether to give the title compound 2 as a white solid (291 mg,

2.2.2. resolution of (s,s)/(r,r)-n-boc-desethylrb
the racemic mixture of n-boc-desethylrb 2 containing
(s,s) and (r,r) enantiomers was resolved using a daicel
chiralpak ad semipreparative column (25010 mm,
10 am) (chiral technologies, exton, pa) connected to a
knauer hplc system (sonntek, woodcliff lake, nj)
equipped with a model 64 pump, a model 87 variable
wavelength monitor (set at 254 nm) and a hewlett-packard
3390a integrator. the column was eluted with 95:5 hexane/
ethanol at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. racemic n-bocdesethylrb (40 mg) was dissolved in methanol (2 ml).
for each injection, 200 al of methanol solution was injected.
the retention times of two enantiomers were 13.8 and
22.7 min. the eluates associated with the peak of each
individual enantiomer were collected, pooled, evaporated,
dissolved in methanol (1 ml) and purified again by the same
procedure via chiral hplc described above. after the
second purification, the enantiomer with r t at 13.8 min
was isolated in 83% (16.5 mg) yield, whereas the
enantiomer with r t at 22.7 min was isolated in 77%
(15.4 mg) yield. both purified enantiomers have enantiomeric purity of n 99%.
2.2.3. determination of absolute configuration of resolved
enantiomers of n-boc-desethylrb
previously, we have prepared racemic ((s,s)/(r,r))
desethylrb 1 through multistep synthetic approach, and
the racemic desethylrb was resolved to obtain pure
enantiomers via chiral hplc column (chiralpak ad) eluted
with 95:5:0.2 hexane/2- xxxd3026xxx /diethylamine [13]. the
absolute configuration for each individual enantiomers
was determined via our comparative pet studies in baboons
[14]. to characterize the configuration of the resolved
n-boc-desethylrb enantiomers and assign which one is
(s,s) enantiomer and which one is (r,r) enantiomer, we
deprotected the resolved n-boc-desethylrb enantiomers
and transformed them into their corresponding enantiomers
of desethylrb. with previously prepared pure (s,s) and
(r,r) enantiomers of desethylrb in hand, we compared the
retention times of the enantiomers obtained via chiral
resolution and boc deprotection with those of pure (s,s)

418

and (r,r) desethylrb using the previously reported chiral
hplc system for resolution of desethylrb (chiralpak ad,
95:5:0.2 hexane/2- xxxd3026xxx /diethylamine). thus, we were
able to assign the (s,s) and (r,r) configurations of the
resolved n-boc-desethylrb.
to each hplc-resolved enantiomer of n-boc-desethylrb (2 mg) in methylene chloride (2 ml) was added
trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml). the mixture was stirred for
30 min and then dried under reduced pressure. the residue
was dissolved in methanol (1 ml) and characterized by
hplc via the comparison of retention times with that of
pure (s,s) and (r,r) enantiomers of desethylrb. the
hplc system used was the same as described above for
the resolution of n-boc-desethylrb, but the hplc solvent
was changed to 95:5:0.2 hexane/2- xxxd3026xxx /diethylamine
at a flow rate of 6 ml/min.
2.2.4. (s,s)/(r,r)-n-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-2-[a-(2-(2fluoroethoxy)phenoxy)benzyl]morpholine (n-boc-frb) 3
a mixture of 2 (195 mg, 0.5 mmol), 2-fluoroethyl
tosylate (150 mg, 0.69 mmol) and methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (1 m, 0.6 ml) in dmf (5 ml) was
stirred for 10 min at ambient temperature, and then heated at
808c for 1 h. after cooling to ambient temperature, aqueous
 xxxd3212xxx  solution (0.1 m, 50 ml) was added, and
the mixture was stirred for 10 min. the mixture was then
extracted with ethyl acetate (250 ml). the combined ethyl
acetate fractions were washed with water, dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced
pressure. the residue was purified by chromatography on
silica gel eluting with 80:20 hexane/ethyl acetate to give the
title compound 3 as a colorless sticky oil (154 mg, 71%).

a mixture of 3 (130 mg, 0.3 mmol), phenol (2.82 g,

first, the column was eluted with 80:20 hexane/ethyl

2.3. radiolabeling
2.3.1. radiosynthesis of [18f]frb and [18f]frb-d4
2-bromoethyl triflate or 2-bromoethyl triflate-d4 (10 al)
in thf (0.2 ml) was added to a 10-ml vacutainer
containing dried [18f]kf/kryptofix 222 (k222), which
was prepared according to our previously published
procedures [20]. the solution was vortexed for 20 s,
followed by 5-min incubation at ambient temperature. the
solution was then heated at 808c, and the volatiles were
distilled with a slow stream (20 ml/min) of argon through
pfa teflon tubing (0.03 in. i.d.) and needle into a 4-ml
septum-sealed reaction vessel cooled in an acetonitrile/dry
ice bath. the reaction vessel contained a freshly prepared
solution of n-boc-desethylrb (3–5 mg) and naoh (5 n,
25 al) in dmf (0.4 ml), and was vented through an
external charcoal trap. after the radioactivity trapped
inside the vessel reached its maximum as monitored by a
nai detector, the vessel was sealed and heated in an oil
bath at 1308c for 30 min. the reaction vessel was cooled
down in an acetonitrile/dry ice bath, added tfa (0.3 ml)
through syringe and needle and heated again at 758c for
7 min. the cap and septum of the reaction vessel were
removed, and the reaction vessel was heated at 758c for an
additional 10 min. a stream of argon (200 ml/min) was
applied while heating to remove the volatiles. water (1 ml)
was then added to the reaction vessel, and the product was
separated using a phenomenex luna c-18 semipreparative
column (25010 mm, 5 am). this column was connected
to a knauer hplc system equipped with a model k-501
pump, a model 87 variable wavelength monitor (set at
254 nm), a nai radioactivity detector and two hewlettpackard 3390a integrators, and was eluted with
250:250:500:8:3.2 acetonitrile/methanol/water/triethylamine/acetic acid at a flow rate of 3.5 ml/min. the
fraction containing [18f]frb(-d4) was collected from
16.7 to 17.7 min after injection. the collected eluate was
rotary evaporated and then coevaporated with acetonitrile.
the residue was dissolved in sterile water (4 ml) and
passed through a 0.22-am millipore filter into a sterile vial
to make the final injectate for whole-body biodistribution
studies in mice.
2.3.2. quality control of [18f]frb(-d4)
the specific activity of [18f]frb(-d4) was determined
by the uv absorbance of the radioactive peak as compared
with a standard curve of frb. the radiochemical purity
was determined by an analytical radio-hplc system and a

k.-s. lin et al. / nuclear medicine and biology 32 (2005) 415– 422

tlc system in the presence of the unlabeled frb as
a carrier. the analytical radio-hplc system consisted of a
phenomenex luna c-18 analytical column (250 mm
4.6 mm, 5 am), a knauer model k-1001 pump, a knauer
model k-1500 solvent organizer, a knauer model k2501
uv detector (254 nm), a nai radioactivity detector and
two hewlett-packard 3390a integrators. the analytical
column was eluted with a combination of acetonitrile
(solvent a) and 0.1 m ammonium formate (solvent b) at a
flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. the gradient was 30:70 a/b to
70:30 a/b in 10 min. the retention time of frb was
7.3 min. for tlc analysis, macherey-nagel polygram sil
g/uv254 plastic-back tlc plate was used. the tlc plate
was developed with 10:0.1 methanol/ammonium hydroxide
and then scanned by using a bioscan system 200 imaging
scanner. the r f of frb was 0.52.
2.3.3. determination of enantiomeric purity of
(s,s)- and(r,r)-[18f]frb(-d4)
when enantiomerically pure n-boc-desethylrb ((s,s) or
(r,r)) was used as the substrate for the radiosynthesis, the
radiochemical and enantiomeric purity of the individually
labeled [18f]frb enantiomer was determined using an
analytical chiral hplc column (daicel chiralpak ad,
2504.6 mm, 10 am) connected to the above analytical
radio-hplc system. by eluting with 92.5:7.5:0.2 hexane/2propanol/diethylamine at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, the
retention times of (s,s)-frb and (r,r)-frb were 22.1 and
25.5 min, respectively.
2.4. log p oct (ph 7.4) measurements
log p was determined according to a modified literature
procedures [21]. briefly, an aliquot of (s,s)-[18f]frb
(0.37 mbq) was added to a vial containing 2.5 ml of
octanol and 2.5 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph = 7.4).
the mixture was vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged at
5000 rpm for 2 min. a sample of the octanol (0.1 ml) and
buffer (1 ml) layers was taken and counted in a well-type
counter. log p oct (ph 7.4) was calculated with the following
equation: log p oct (ph 7.4) =log10 [((counts in octanol
phase)10)/(counts in buffer phase)]. the major portion of
the octanol layer (2.0 ml) was diluted with 0.5 ml of octanol
and mixed with a fresh portion of 2.5 ml of phosphate
buffer. the equilibration procedure described above was
repeated until a constant value of log p oct (ph 7.4) was
obtained.
2.5. biodistribution of the (s,s)-[18f]frb and
(s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 in normal mice
all procedures in mice were reviewed and approved by
the brookhaven institutional animal care and use committee. normal male swiss webster mice weighing
27.6–34.0 g were used for biodistribution studies. (s,s)[18f]frb or (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 (0.185 mbq) in 0.2 ml of
saline was injected into mice via the tail vein.  xxxd1891xxx  min,
30 min, 1 h and 2 h postinjection, four mice for each time

419

point were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. major organs
were dissected, weighed and counted using the automated
gamma counter with aliquots of the injectate as standards
counted at the same time. the percent injected dose per
organ (% id/organ) and the percent injected dose per gram
(% id/g) were calculated.
3. results and discussion
3.1. chemistry
the synthetic pathway for the preparation of the
precursor ((s,s)/(r,r)-n-boc-desethylrb, 2) and the reference compound ((s,s)/(r,r)-frb, 4) from (s,s)/(r,r)desethylrb 1 is shown in scheme 1. desethylrb was
synthesized according to our previously published procedures [13]. desethylrb contains a phenol and a secondary
amino group. to prevent possible n-[18f]fluoroethylation,
the precursor 2 was prepared by the protection of morpholine nitrogen with boc group. boc was chosen due to its
relatively easy formation, inertness to bases and mild
nucleophiles, and easy removal by acidic hydrolysis [22].
selective n-protection of desethylrb with boc was carried
out using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of weak
base, sodium bicarbonate with 75% yield. the reference
compound frb 4 was prepared in the following two steps
from n-boc-desethylrb. first, n-boc-desethylrb was
fluoroethylated at the phenolic oxygen using 2-fluoroethyl
tosylate [18] to give n-boc-frb 3 in 71% yield. the
subsequent boc removal of 3 with 3:1 phenol/chlorotrimethylsilane [23] yielded frb in 83%.
3.2. chiral separation
chiral resolution of n-boc-desethylrb was achieved by
using a daicel chiralpak ad semipreparative column
eluted with 95:5 hexane/ethanol to give both enantiomers
with n99% enantiomeric purity. to determine the absolute
configuration ((s,s) and (r,r)) of the n-boc-desethylrb,
each resolved enantiomer was transformed to the
corresponding desethylrb followed by the comparison
of retention times with those of (s,s)-desethylrb and
(r,r)-desethylrb [13] using the same chiral column but a
different hplc solvent system, 95:5:0.2 hexane/2- xxxd3026xxx /
diethylamine. the deprotected product of the first enantiomer (r t = 13.8 min) of n-boc-desethylrb coeluted with
(s,s)-desethylrb at 26.1 min, whereas the deprotected
product of the second enantiomer (r t =22.7 min) of n-bocdesethylrb coeluted with (r,r)-desethylrb at 19.0 min.
3.3. radiosynthesis
the radiosynthesis of f-18-labeled racemic frb and
frb-d4, and their individual enantiomers were conducted
via [18f]fluoroethylation as shown in scheme 2. the
racemate and the individual enantiomers of n-bocdesethylrb were used as the precursors for [18f]frb
and [18f]frb-d4 via a three-step procedure, and the

radiochemical yields and required time for each step in the
radiosynthesis of [18f]frb and [18f]frb-d4 were listed in
table 1. first, 1-bromo-2-[18f]fluoroethane ([18f]bfe or
[18f]bfe-d4) was prepared as a secondary radiolabeling
synthon by the nucleophilic displacement of 2-bromoethyl
triflate(-d4) with [18f]f in thf. other secondary radiolabeling synthons including 1-[18f]fluoro-2-iodoethane
[24,25], 2-[18f]fluoroethyl triflate [26,27], 2-[18f]fluoroethyl tosylate [28–30] and 2-[18f]fluoroethyl mesylate
[29] have also been reported for the introduction of
[18f]fluoroethyl group. however, with the advantage of
easy purification by simple distillation, [18f]bfe was
widely adapted by others [18,19,31–34]. the subsequent
coupling of n-boc-desethylrb with [18f]bfe(-d4) was
carried out in dmf in the presence of excess base. up to
61% radiochemical yield of n-boc-[18f]frb(-d4) was
obtained after 30 min of incubation at 1308c. trying to
reduce the incubation time or lower the reaction temperature resulted in unsatisfied radiochemical yields (data not
shown), probably due to the relatively inactiveness of alkyl
bromide compared with alkyl iodide or triflate. recently,
zhang et al. [35] reported that significantly improved
radiochemical yields of coupling amines or phenols with
[18f]bfe could be obtained by adding small amount of
nai into the reaction mixture. this might be due to the
formation of the more reactive intermediate, 1-[18f]fluoro2-iodoethane, through finkelstein reaction. the application
of this methodology to shorten the reaction time and further
improve the radiochemical yield of n-boc-[18f]frb(-d4)
is currently under investigation. at the last step, the boc
group for the protection of morpholine nitrogen was
removed by treating n-boc-[18f]frb(-d4) with trifluoroacetic acid. after hplc purification, the racemic or
enantiomerically pure ((s,s) or (r,r)) [18f]frb(-d4) was
obtained in 11–27% decay-corrected radiochemical yields
from [18f]f in a synthesis time of 120 min (table 1) with
a radiochemical purity of n 98% and a specific activity of
21–48 gbq/amol (eob). note that the elution orders of
(r,r) versus (s,s) enantiomers for desethylrb and n-boc-

desethylrb were reversed under the semipreparative chiral
hplc system, and the elution orders of (r,r) versus (s,s)
enantiomers for n-boc-desethylrb and frb were reversed as well under the same chiral hplc system. the
hexane/ethanol constituted mobile phase that was successfully used for the chiral separation of enantiomers of nboc-desethylrb showed less enantioselectivity for the
enantiomeric pair of frb. when ethanol was replaced
with 2- xxxd3026xxx  in the mobile phase, the enantioselectivity
for enantiomers of frb increased, and a reversal in the
elution order of (r,r) versus (s,s) enantiomer was
observed. similar results were obtained in the case of nboc-desethylrb and desethylrb. the reversed elution
order of enantiomeric pairs on chiralpak ad, an amylose
tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)-based chiral stationary
phase, on changing the mobile phase modifier from
ethanol to 2- xxxd3026xxx  (or 2- xxxd3026xxx  to ethanol) has also
been previously reported by our group [13] and others
[36–38]. this chromatographic behavior is believed to be
due to the conformation change of chiral stationary phase
induced by different alcohol modifiers and has been
demonstrated by wenslow and wang [39] using solidstate nmr spectrometry.
3.4. log p oct (ph 7.4) measurements
log p oct (ph 7.4) of frb was determined by traditional
extraction with octanol and ph 7.4 phosphate buffer, and
was 0.91f0.01 (the meanfs.d. of the last seven results of
eight consecutive extractions). this log p oct (ph 7.4) value
is in the range of 0.9–2.5 [40] required for a radiotracer to
pass freely across the blood–brain barrier.
3.5. biodistribution in mice
whole-body biodistribution studies in normal mice with
(s,s)-[18f]frb and (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 were performed to
compare the extent of in vivo defluorination, and the
results were shown in tables 2 and 3, respectively. the
biodistribution results of (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 was very
similar to those of (s,s)-[18f]frb but with relatively faster

blood clearance (radioactivity in blood at 2 h postinjection:
(s,s)-[18f]frb, 0.44f0.03% id/g vs. (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4,
0.22f0.03% id/g; p b.001, two-sample t test). both (s,s)[18f]frb and (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 showed high radioactivity accumulation in kidneys, liver, and intestines, indicating
the excretion of these two radiotracers through both
hepatobiliary and renal systems. moderate brain uptakes
were observed for both (s,s)-[18f]frb (0.59% id) and
(s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 (0.46% id)  xxxd1891xxx  min postinjection, and
the washout from the brain was slow. these brain uptake
values were comparable to the rat brain uptake (0.53% id,
5 min postinjection) reported by wilson et al. [11] using
(s,s)-[11c]mrb. in the case of (s,s)-[18f]frb, the
radioactivity accumulation in femur decreased initially but
increased slightly at 2 h postinjection (% id/g: 1.74, 1.08,
0.65 and 0.83  xxxd1891xxx , 30, 60 and 120 min, respectively),
which was an evidence of in vivo defluorination. in
contrast, there is no significant defluorination with the
tetradeuterated (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 as the radioactivity
accumulation in femur decreased continuously (% id/g:
1.58, 1.11, 0.54 and 0.25  xxxd1891xxx , 30, 60 and 120 min,
respectively), as opposed to the previously reported
[18f]fluoromethylated analogs ((s,s)-[18f]fmener and
(s,s)-[18f]fmener-d2) [15], which showed continuously
increased bone uptake. this newly synthesized [18f]fluoroethylated analog (s,s)-[18f]frb showed less defluorination in vivo, and the extent of in vivo defluorination was
further reduced by deuterium substitution as seen for (s,s)[18f]frb-d4. at 2 h postinjection of (s,s)-[18f]frb, the
average bone uptake and blood activity was 0.83f0.04 and
0.44f0.03% id/g, respectively; that is, its bone uptake was
significantly higher than its blood activity ( p b.001, twosample t test). on the other hand, with the deuterium
substitution, at 2 h postinjection of (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4, the
average bone uptake and blood activity was 0.25f0.03 and
0.22f0.03% id/g, respectively. these results indicated that
the bone uptake of (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4 was significantly
lower than that of (s,s)-[18f]frb ( p b.001, two-sample
t test). furthermore, the uptakes both in bone and blood

421
18

were similar in the case of (s,s)-[ f]frb-d4 at 2
h postinjection. these results strongly suggest the inhibition of in vivo defluorination via a deuterium isotope effect
and are similar to those previously shown in the case of
aryl dideuterated [18f]fluoromethyl ethers including (s,s)[18f]fmener-d2 [15] and [18f] xxxd1848xxx -rq [41]. however,
to the best of our knowledge, no study on the comparison
of in vivo defluorination of aryl [18f]fluoroethyl ether and
its tetradeuterated analog has ever been reported. the
mechanism of the deuterium isotope effect on reduction of
in vivo defluorination is not clear at this stage. however,
our results indicate that deuterium substitution on aryl
[18f]fluoroethyl ethers may provide a useful strategy to
minimize in vivo defluorination.
4. conclusions
we have synthesized racemic and enantiomerically pure
((s,s) and (r,r)) [18f]frb and its tetradeuterated analog
[18f]frb-d4 in good yields for comparative pet studies. in
whole-body biodistribution studies, (s,s)-[18f]frb-d4
showed faster blood clearance and no significant defluorination, and therefore, may be promising for imaging net
with pet. the methodology for reducing in vivo defluorination through a deuterium isotope effect has a great
potential to be applied to the development of aryl
[18f]fluoroethyl ether type radiotracers.
