abstract
vardenafil has higher affinity to phosphodiesterase-5 (pde5)
than sildenafil and lower administered dosage for the treatment
of erectile dysfunction. however, the molecular basis for these
differences is puzzling because two drugs have similar chemical structures. reported here is a crystal structure of the fully
active and nonmutated pde5a1 catalytic domain in complex
with vardenafil. the structure shows that the conformation of
the h-loop in the pde5a1-vardenafil complex is different from

cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (pdes) are key enzymes controlling cellular concentrations of the second messengers camp and cgmp (mehats et al., 2002; houslay and
adams, 2003; goraya and cooper, 2005; bender and beavo,
2006; lugnier, 2006; conti and beavo, 2007; omori and
kotera, 2007). the human genome encodes 21 pde genes
that are categorized into 11 families. alternative mrna
splicing of the pde genes produces approximately 100 isoforms of pde proteins that distribute in various cellular
compartments and control myriad physiological processes.
pde molecules contain a variable regulatory domain and a
conserved catalytic domain but show distinct substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity. family-selective pde inhibitors have been widely studied as therapeutic agents for
treatment of various human diseases, including cardiotonics,
vasodilators, smooth muscle relaxants, antidepressants, antithrombotics, antiasthmatics, and agents for improving
learning and memory (truss et al., 2001; rotella, 2002;
schrör, 2002; castro et al., 2005; houslay et al., 2005; lipworth, 2005; blokland et al., 2006; menniti et al., 2006).

those of any known structures of the unliganded pde5 and its
complexes with the inhibitors. in addition, the molecular configuration of vardenafil differs from that of sildenafil when bound
to pde5. it is noteworthy that the binding of vardenafil causes
loss of the divalent metal ions that have been observed in all the
previously published pde structures. the conformational variation of both pde5 and the inhibitors provides structural insight
into the different potencies of the drugs.

pde5 inhibitors (fig. 1) sildenafil (viagra), vardenafil (levitra), and tadalafil (cialis), which have been used for treatment of male erectile dysfunction (rotella et al., 2002). sildenafil (revatio) has also been approved for treatment of
pulmonary hypertension (galié et al., 2005). korean authorities have recently approved  xxxd3464xxx  (fig. 1) for treatment of
male erectile dysfunction (salem et al., 2006) . although
these four pde5 inhibitors have been successfully approved
as the drugs for treatment of human diseases, the enthusiasm for development of novel pde5 inhibitors continues.
pde5 inhibitors have been shown to have potential for other
medical applications, including improvement of memory and
treatment of cancer and heart disease (blokland et al., 2006;
salem et al., 2006; stehlik and movsesian, 2006; supuran et
al., 2006; padma-nathan et al., 2007; palmer et al., 2007;
zhu and strada, 2007; sandner et al., 2008). much attention
has been focused on the recent development of the second
generation of pde5 inhibitors that have the same or different scaffolds from the current drugs but different pharmacokinetic profiles (palmer et al., 2007).
sildenafil, vardenafil, and  xxxd3464xxx  have similar chemical
formulae (fig. 1) and possess similar key pharmacophores
that provide for their function. these inhibitors also have the
same target and interact with many of the same residues at
the active site of pde5, as shown by the crystal structures of
the isolated pde5 catalytic domain in complex with silde-

crystal structure of pde5-vardenafil

materials and methods
protein expression and purification of the pde5a1 catalytic domain. the cdna of the catalytic domain of human pde5a1
was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the gene of bovine
 xxxg1701xxx , as described previously (wang et al., 2006). the coding
region for amino acids 535 to 860 of pde5a1 was amplified by pcr
and subcloned into the expression vector pet15b. the resultant
plasmid pet-pde5a1 was transferred into escherichia coli strain
bl21-codonplus (stratagene, la jolla, ca) for overexpression. the
e. coli cell carrying pet-pde5a1 was grown in luria-bertani medium at 37°c to absorption a600 ⫽ 0.7 and then 0.1 mm isopropyl
␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for further growth at 15°c
overnight. recombinant pde5a1 was passed through the nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (qiagen, valencia, ca), subjected to thrombin cleavage to remove the his tag, and further
purified by q-sepharose and sephacryl s300 column chromatography (ge healthcare, chalfont st. giles, buckinghamshire, uk). a
typical purification yielded over 10 mg of pde5a1 with a purity
⬎95% from a 2-liter cell culture.
protein crystallization and structure determination. the
cocrystal of pde5a1 (535–860) with vardenafil was grown by vapor
diffusion. the complex of pde5a1-vardenafil was prepared by mixing 1 mm vardenafil with 15 mg/ml pde5a1 at 4°c overnight. the
protein drop was set up by mixing 2 ␮l of protein solution with 2 ␮l
of well buffer and crystallized against a well buffer of 12%  xxxd2982xxx  3350, 15% glycerol, and 0.1 m sodium acetate ph 4.6 at
25°c. the pde5a1-vardenafil crystals have the space group p212121
with cell dimensions of a ⫽ 68.9, b ⫽ 87.8, and c ⫽ 138.5 å (table 1).
diffraction data were collected on beamline x29 at brookhaven national laboratory and processed by program hkl (otwinowski and
minor, 1997).
the structure of the pde5a1-vardenafil cocrystal was solved by
molecular replacement program amore (navaza and saludjian,
1997), using the pde5a1- xxxd2388xxx  structure without the h-loop as the
initial model. the atomic model was built with the use of the program o (jones et al., 1991) against the electron density map that was
improved by the density modification package of ccp4. the structure was refined by cns (crystallography and nmr system) (table

nafil and vardenafil (sung et al., 2003; card et al., 2004; huai
et al., 2004; zhang et al., 2004; wang et al., 2006). although
the head-to-head comparison is still lacking, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses showed that these
pde5 inhibitors have similar efficacy and tolerance but exhibit some functional differences both in vitro and in vivo
(briganti et al., 2005; shabsigh et al., 2006; supuran et al.,
2006; wright, 2006; doggrell, 2007; mehrotra et al., 2007).
for example, vardenafil shows 10- to 40-fold tighter binding
with pde5 than sildenafil and has an area under the curve of
74.5 ␮g 䡠 h/liter at a 20-mg dosage compared with 1965 for
sildenafil at a 100-mg dosage (shabsigh et al., 2006; mehrotra et al., 2007).
however, the structural basis for the different potencies of
these inhibitors is still puzzling. the early studies on the
crystal structures of pde5 in complex with sildenafil and
vardenafil by two groups showed inconsistent results. vardenafil and sildenafil have the same extended configuration in
the crystal structures reported by sung et al. (2003), in
contrast to the folded configuration of both inhibitors in the
report by zhang et al. (2004). because the  xxxg1701xxx  catalytic
domain used by sung et al. (2003) is basically inactive and
the structure reported by zhang et al. (2004) contains a
chimeric replacement of the  xxxg1701xxx  h-loop with the  xxxg1700xxx 
h-loop, the biologically relevant conformation of these drugs
has remained a question.
to address this question, the crystal structure of the
fully active and nonmutated catalytic domain of pde5a1
in complex with vardenafil has been determined and compared with the previously published cocrystal structures of
the enzyme with sildenafil and vardenafil. the structural
comparison shows dramatic differences between the vardenafil and sildenafil complexes in both pde5 protein conformation and the inhibitor configuration. these differences are likely to contribute to the different properties of
these drugs.

architecture of the pde5-vardenafil structure. the
enzyme of the pde5a1 catalytic domain used in these studies was fully active and exhibited kinetic properties (kcat, km)
similar to those for the full-length pde5a1 (wang et al.,
2006). the structure of the pde5a1 catalytic domain (residues 535–860) in complex with vardenafil consists of 15
␣-helices (fig. 2). most of the residues in the pde5a1-vardenafil cocrystal had solid electron density and were traced
without ambiguity. residues 660 to 672 and 792 to 806,
which are parts of the h- and m-loops, lacked electron density and were disordered. the superimposition of pde5a1vardenafil over other previously determined pde5a1
structures (huai et al., 2004; wang et al., 2006) yielded
root-mean-square deviations of 0.49, 0.54, 0.51, and 0.47
å, respectively for c␣ atoms of 270 comparable residues
(536–657, 686–787, and 813–859) of the unliganded
pde5a1 and its complexes with  xxxd2388xxx , icarisid ii, and
sildenafil, indicating the overall similarity among the
pde5 structures. however, the pde5a1-vardenafil structure shows dramatic conformation differences in the hand m-loops from the known pde5 structures.
different conformational changes induced by vardenafil and sildenafil binding. the h-loop of pde5 was
previously shown to have four different conformations depending on the liganded state of the protein: 1) a coil conformation in the unliganded state, 2) two short ␣-helices (h8
and h9) at residues 664 to 667 and 672 to 676 in the  xxxd2388xxx 
complex, 3) a 310 helix in the sildenafil complex, and 4) two
short ␤-strands in the icarisid ii complex (wang et al., 2006).
in addition, these conformation changes of the h-loop upon
the inhibitor binding are coupled with the dramatic positional movements, up to 7, 24, and 35 å in these three
complexes, respectively. the position and conformation of the
h-loop in the pde5a1-vardenafil structure also differs sig-

nificantly from those of the known pde5 structures. first,
helix h9 in the pde5a1-vardenafil cocrystal contains residues ser675 to ile680, compared with the sequence of 671 to
675 in the pde5a1- xxxd2388xxx  complex; the latter composition of
the h-loop resembles the residues of helix h9 in other pde
families (ke and wang, 2007). second, the h-loop in the
pde5a1-vardenafil complex shows a positional shift of as
much as 20 å from that in the unliganded form. third, the
n-terminal residues 680 to 685 of helix h10 that contains
residues 680 to 693 in all the early structures of pde5 and
other pde families are in a coil conformation in the pde5a1vardenafil structure. finally, residues 792 to 808 of the
m-loop in the pde5a1-vardenafil structure are disordered.
this disorder is similar to features of this region found in the
unliganded and  xxxd2388xxx -bound pde5a1 structures (wang et
al., 2006) but is in contrast to the ordered conformation of the
m-loop in the cocrystal structures of pde5-sildenafil and
pde5-icarisid ii. because the m-loop contains a coiled fragment around leu804 that contacts the inhibitors and most
likely the cgmp substrate (fig. 2), its disorder in the
pde5a1-vardenafil structure is likely to have some implication for both inhibitor and substrate binding. however, this
possibility will require further study.
vardenafil caused loss of the divalent metal binding. the most surprising feature of the pde5a1-vardenafil
structure is the absence of divalent metals at the active site
(fig. 2). this is in contrast to the absolute conservation of the
binding of two divalent metal ions at the active sites of all
early reported structures of pde5 and other pde families
(wang et al., 2006; ke and wang, 2007), even in the presence
of the metal-chelating agent edta during the protein purification of the pde4b2b catalytic domain (xu et al., 2000).
because the divalent metals and their binding residues are
not involved in crystallographic lattice contacts, the loss of
the divalent metals in the pde5-vardenafil complex is unlikely to be an artifact of the crystal packing. rather, the loss
of the metal ions in the pde5-vardenafil structure is apparently due to the influence of the conformational changes in
the h-loop. a careful examination shows that two of the
zinc-binding residues (his617 and asp764) are well superimposed with those in the other pde5 structures (fig. 2d), as
shown by small positional differences of 0.15 and 0.19 å for
their c␣ atoms between the structures of pde5a1-vardenafil
and pde5a1-sildenafil. however, two other important
metal-binding residues (his653 and asp654) in the pde5a1vardenafil complex show shifts of 0.76 and 0.80 å from those
in the pde5a1-sildenafil complex although their conformations are retained; the magnitudes of these shifts are almost
twice the overall root-mean-square deviation of 0.47 å for all
the atoms in the structures. in addition, the positioning of
his684 in the pde5-vardenafil complex is completely different from that in the pde5-sildenafil structure, and its imidazole ring is now located at the site normally occupied by
the second metal ion or magnesium (fig. 2d). thus, the
positional and conformational changes of asp654 and his684
apparently act to eliminate binding of both divalent cations.
because asp654 and his684 are located, respectively, at the
n and c termini of the h-loop, the conformational change of
the h-loop upon vardenafil binding seems to be the driving
force that causes loss of the metals. this suggests that loss of
catalytic activity in the presence of vardenafil is due to two
factors: 1) direct competition between vardenafil and cgmp

crystal structure of pde5-vardenafil

for access to the catalytic site and 2) vardenafil-induced loss
of divalent cations from the catalytic site.
to study whether the inactive pde5-vardenafil complex
can regain the catalytic activity, the pde5a1 catalytic domain (residues 535–860) was mixed with 1.5 mm vardenafil
for 4 h and then passed through a sephacryl s300 gel filtration column in a plain running buffer of 20 mm tris-hcl, ph
7.5, 50 mm nacl, and 1 mm  xxxd26xxx  without
inhibitor vardenafil. the specific activities of the native
pde5, the pde5-vardenafil complex, and the fraction eluted
from the s300 column were measured at five repeats by using
a method previously described (wang et al., 2006) and the
assay buffer of 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm mgcl2, and 0.2 ␮m cgmp. they were 39.8 ⫾ 0.6

0.02 for the protein in complex with 1.5 mm vardenafil, and

2.0 ⫾ 0.4 for the protein after passed the s300 column.
addition of 10 and 100 nm zinc to the assay buffer increased
the specific activity for the protein eluted from the s300
column by approximately 2-fold (3.9 ⫾ 1.1 and 4.4 ⫾ 1.0
nmol/min/mg). the second time passing through the s300
column did not further increase the activity. these experiments suggest that the limited catalytic activity can be regained from the inactive pde5-vardenafil complex by passing the gel filtration column. the small percentage (10%) of
activity recovery implies the improper elution conditions or
the trap of vardenafil in the closed active site.

8%, which compares well with 9.4% of the bound sildenafil
(wang et al., 2006). however, the bound vardenafil shows
molecular configuration and interactions different from those
of the bound sildenafil (fig. 3). the key difference is the
orientation of the piperazine portion of two drugs. the ethylpiperazine of vardenafil orients to the surface of the binding pocket and is extended to interact with residues of
tyr676 to ile680. in comparison, the methylpiperazine of
sildenafil folds back to its molecular entity and interacts with
residues asn662 to ile665 of the h-loop, but not tyr676ile680, via van der waals’ interactions.

discussion
vardenafil possesses a chemical structure very similar to
sildenafil, but is 10- to 40-fold more potent than sildenafil for
pde5 inhibition and a smaller clinically administered dosage
for treatment of erectile dysfunction (saenz de tejada et al.,
2001; corbin et al., 2004; setter et al., 2005; supuran et al.,
2006; mehrotra et al., 2007). thus, the structural basis for
their different biochemical and physiological properties has
been a puzzle. the results of the early studies on the crystal
structures of  xxxg1701xxx  isolated catalytic domain in complex
with sildenafil and vardenafil showed the similar binding
mode of these inhibitors but did not entirely agree (sung et
al., 2003; zhang et al., 2004). vardenafil and sildenafil had
the same extended configuration in the structures by sung et
al. (2003), in contrast to the folded configuration of both
inhibitors in the report by zhang et al. (2004) (fig. 3). the

of pde5a1 and between a sulfonamide oxygen of vardenafil
and the backbone nitrogen of cys677 of pde5a1. in addition,
two water molecules bind to o6 and n8 of the imidazotriazinone. for hydrophobic interactions, the propyl-imidazotriazinone of vardenafil stacks against phe820 of pde5a1 and
also contacts residues tyr612, his613, ile680, leu765,
ala767, ile768, leu782, phe786, and gln817. the ethoxy
group orients to a hydrophobic pocket and interacts via van
der waals forces with ala779, val782, ile813, and gln817.
the phenyl group forms hydrophobic interactions with
tyr676, met816, gln817, and phe820. the ether oxygen of
the ethoxyphenyl group has a distance of 3.18 å to the amide
oxygen of the side chain of gln817. this distance is an unfavorable interaction because both oxygen atoms have no proton for formation of a hydrogen bond and also because
gln817 is unlikely to switch its side-chain orientation because of its pre-existing hydrogen bond with gln775. the
sulfonamide group (-so2n) of vardenafil contacts tyr676,
cys677, and ile680 of the h-loop, in addition to the stack
against phe820. the ethylpiperazine group orients to the
surface of the binding pocket and interacts with met816,
gly819, and phe820.
vardenafil binding to pde5 shares a number of similarities with the binding characteristics of sildenafil, including
similar location of their ethoxyphenyl and imidazotriazinone/
pyrazolopyrimidinone groups, the same stacking against
phe820, and the hydrogen bonds with glu817 (fig. 3). in
addition, both inhibitors are buried in the catalytic pocket.

seem to result from the rotation of the single c-s bond.
although the energy barrier for the single bond rotation is
minimal in theory, it is rare that the same inhibitors adopt
different conformations when bound to their receptors. because the  xxxg1701xxx  catalytic domain used by sung et al. (2003)
was basically inactive and the structure reported by zhang et
al. (2004) contains a chimeric replacement of the  xxxg1701xxx 
h-loop with the  xxxg1700xxx  h-loop, the biologically relevant configurations of these inhibitors is in question. the configuration of vardenafil in our structure is similar to that in the
structure reported by sung et al. (2003), whereas our sildenafil configuration is similar to that reported by zhang et al.
(2004). because our pde5 protein is fully active and contains
all native pde5 residues, the configuration difference between vardenafil and sildenafil is likely to be relevant to the
biological and physiological properties of these inhibitors.
our previous studies have already shown that the h-loop
of  xxxg1701xxx  is highly flexible and can adopt different conformations and positional locations upon binding of the inhibitors (wang et al., 2006). this study adds significant new
structural information pertaining to the interactions between pde5 and vardenafil. although it is not clear whether
the individual conformation of the h-loop can be exploited for
design of new pde5 inhibitors, the flexibility of the h-loop is
likely to be an important allosteric mechanism that affects
substrate and inhibitor binding. the isolated pde5a1 catalytic domain showed similar binding affinity with vardenafil
and sildenafil, and the vardenafil affinity is significantly
boosted by the involvement of gaf-b of pde5a1 regulatory
domain (blount et al., 2006). this implies that the unique
features associated with the interaction of each of these inhibitors with the pde5 catalytic domain are likely to play a
major role in determining the influence of the regulatory
domain on inhibitor affinity. a full understanding of the
molecular effects of these inhibitors will require further
structural study within the context of the pde5 holoenzyme.
it is interesting to note that the pde4-selective inhibitor
 xxxd3142xxx  caused relocalization of the full-length pde4a4 and
was suggested to trigger a conformational change on a loop
interacting with mg2⫹ (terry et al., 2003). besides, the binding of camp to the gaf domain of trypanosome pdeb1
(laxman et al., 2005) and cgmp to the gaf domain of
human pde5 (zoraghi et al., 2005) induced the allosteric
conformational changes of the enzymes. these observations,
together with the structural study done here, suggest that
conformational changes promoted by the binding of inhibitors and substrates in the certain pde families are essential
for the regulations such as phosphorylation of pde4 and
cgmp/camp binding to gaf domains of pdes. the h-loop of
pde5 likely serves as a key mediator of the allosteric regulation of enzymatic activity.
