the treatment of sleep disorders.  narcolepsy is clinically associated with cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. it is treated by reassurance (that there is no physical disease) and by stimulants such as ephedrine and amphetamine on an intermittent basis. the special tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is also used, and mono xxxd2850xxx  oxidase inhibitors (maois) are useful in theory. obstructive sleep apnoea is an important and often unrecognised cause of daytime somnolence. it is treated by weight reduction (pickwickian syndrome), hormones, or recently, with continuous positive pressure apparatus. night terrors (pavor nocturnus) and sleepwalking typically occur during deep sleep (stage 3 and 4 throughout the episode) in children. in a night terror the child sits up with a scream, with eyes open, but inaccessible. he eventually falls asleep calmly. sleepwalking, too, shows the features of inaccessibility and subsequent amnesia for the episode. both conditions are normally treated with reassurance (to the parents) but may occasionally warrant benzodiazepines. enuresis usually occurs in non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep, especially stages 3 and 4. the reason for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is not precisely known. delirium tremens (dt) is treated as a rebound excess of rem sleep, with benzodiazepines and other drugs. it is the withdrawal syndrome (with or without major seizures) to the barbiturate-alcohol group of drugs, which includes alcohol, chloral, paraldehyde,  xxxd2214xxx , methylprylone,  xxxd2051xxx , meprobamate and meprobamate-diphenhydramine. insomnia may be treated by the above drugs, by analgesics, antidepressants, major tranquillisers (neuroleptics) and miscellaneous other compounds. for the majority of patients, however, the most suitable group seems to be the benzodiazepines. the benzodiazepines are much safer than their predecessors, in both acute and chronic usage.(abstract truncated at 250 words).
