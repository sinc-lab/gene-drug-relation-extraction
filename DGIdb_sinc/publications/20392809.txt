abstract——this topically limited review explores
the relationship between the immune system and insulin-like growth factors ( xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx ) and the
proteins through which they act, including  xxxg1145xxx  ( xxxg1145xxx ) and the  xxxg1144xxx  binding proteins. the
igf/ xxxg1145xxx  pathway plays important and diverse
roles in tissue development and function. it regulates
cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and the translation
of proteins. many of the consequences ascribed to
 xxxg1145xxx  activation result from its association with several accessory proteins that are either identical or
closely related to those involved in  xxxg1194xxx 
signaling. relatively recent awareness that  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg1145xxx  regulate immune function has cast this pathway in an unexpected light; it may represent an important switch governing the quality and amplitude of
immune responses.  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  signaling may also
participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, although its relationship with these processes
seems complex and relatively unexplored. on the one

hand,  xxxg1144xxx  seems to protect experimental animals
from developing insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus. in
contrast, activating antibodies directed at  xxxg1145xxx 
have been detected in patients with graves’ disease,
where the receptor is overexpressed by multiple cell
types. the frequency of igf-irⴙ b and t cells is substantially increased in patients with that disease. potential involvement of  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases suggests that this
pathway might constitute an attractive therapeutic
target.  xxxg1145xxx  has been targeted in efforts directed
toward drug development for cancer, employing both
small-molecule and monoclonal antibody approaches.
these have been generally well-tolerated. recognizing
the broader role of  xxxg1145xxx  in regulating both normal
and pathological immune responses may offer important opportunities for therapeutic intervention in several allied diseases that have proven particularly difficult to treat.

i. introduction

throughout life, although the consequences of its normal
or abnormal activation change with aging.  xxxg1145xxx  and
its related proteins have been implicated in many diseases, including growth abnormalities, metabolic disorders, and several forms of cancer (baserga et al., 2003;
kant et al., 2007; frasca et al., 2008). thus, this pathway continues to attract interest as a potentially useful
target for therapeutic design (clemmons, 2007).
detection of  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  mrnas and the proteins they encode in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
suggests that this pathway might serve some regulatory
function in the “professional” immune system. moreover,  xxxg1144xxx  production, action, and intracellular signaling can be influenced by multiple cytokines and the
pathways they use.  xxxg1145xxx  expression on the surface of
t lymphocytes can be down-regulated after cell activation (schillaci et al., 1998).  xxxg1144xxx  enhances diverse aspects of bone marrow function, including lymphocyte
maturation (clark et al., 1993), granulopoiesis (merchav
et al., 1988), and erythropoiesis (kurtz et al., 1982).
 xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  (gh), which drives much of the  xxxg1144xxx 
generation occurring in liver, promotes hematopoietic
growth (murphy et al., 1992a,b,c). its effects are substantial in that they can attenuate the myelosuppressive
effects of powerful chemotherapeutic agents such as
 xxxd3553xxx  (murphy et al., 1992a,b,c). administration of gh and  xxxg1144xxx  or driving the production of  xxxg1144xxx 
and  xxxg1146xxx  using transgenic approaches in animals promotes both b and t cell development. thus, there is
reason to explore the potential for this endocrine pathway as a regulator of immunity. moreover, targeting
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  signaling as a strategy for altering the
natural course of chronic inflammation may become an
attractive means of managing autoimmune disease.
this review attempts to describe recent findings implying that the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway plays diverse
roles in regulating immune function. these new insights
become particularly important in the context of therapy

insulin-like growth factors (igf-i1 and  xxxg1146xxx ), their
binding proteins (igfbps), and the receptors mediating
their signaling (types i and ii  xxxg1145xxx ), play critical roles
in normal development, growth, metabolism, and homeostasis (adams et al., 2000; de meyts and whittaker,
2002). the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway exerts such diverse influence
on mammalian biology that the scope of its function is
only now beginning to be understood. it has been insinuated in fundamental processes such as determining life
span and coping with oxidative stress in rodents (holzenberger et al., 2003).  xxxg1145xxx  bears both structural and
functional resemblance to other closely related tyrosine
kinase receptors, such as inr in drosophila melanogaster (kennington et al., 2006) and daf-2 in caenorhabditis elegans (kenyon et al., 1993; dorman et al.,
1995; kennington et al., 2007). it begins functioning
during fetal development and retains its importance

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

discovery. a number of biological agents, both small
molecules and monoclonal antibodies, are entering the
late stages of development. they have been examined as
potential treatment for neoplastic diseases (baserga et
al., 2003; clemmons, 2007). the widening scope of activities recently ascribed to  xxxg1144xxx  should provoke a
search for broader applications for agents that can disrupt  xxxg1145xxx  signaling through a variety of mechanisms.
if  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  regulates immune function, autoimmune diseases might represent unanticipated indications for drugs targeting this pathway.
ii. structure and biology of insulin-like growth
factor-i, insulin-like growth factor receptor,
and insulin-like growth factor-i
binding proteins
a. insulin-like growth factor-i
 xxxg1144xxx  represents one of several structurally related
polypeptides that also include  xxxg1146xxx , insulin, and relaxin (bryant-greenwood and schwabe, 1994). it comprises 70 amino acids organized into a and b chains
connected by disulfide bonds. (fig. 1) the amino acid
sequence of human  xxxg1144xxx  was first reported by
rinderknecht and humbel (1978).  xxxg1144xxx  possesses a
connecting or c-peptide region of 12 amino acids. this
region has been shown to determine the high-affinity
binding of  xxxg1144xxx  to the type i  xxxg1145xxx  (bayne et al.,

fig. 1. structures of the  xxxg1145xxx  and its ligand. three-dimensional structure of large domain 1 (l1)–cys-rich (cr)-l2 domain of
 xxxg1145xxx  determined by x-ray crystallography. an extended bilobed structure (40 ⫻ 48 ⫻ 105 å) comprises the two globular l-domains with a new
type of right-handed ␤-helix fold that flanks the cr domain. they seem
to be part of the leucine-rich-repeat superfamily. although l1 (residues
1–15; green) contacts the cr domain (blue) along its length, there is
minimal contact with l2 (residues 300 – 460; orange). flexibility between
cr domain and l2 could affect ligand binding. a ⫺30-å diameter cavity
represents a potential binding pocket. the amino acids that have been
determined by alanine-scanning mutagenesis to be important for ligand
binding are shown in yellow as van der waals spheres. three-dimensional  xxxg1144xxx  structure is based on the x-ray coordinates from brzozowski
et al. (2002). the backbone is shown in blue. [reproduced from de meyts

1989). an eight-amino acid d-region peptide forms an
extension of the carboxyl terminus (brissenden et al.,
1984).
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  circulate in the plasma as complexes
formed with igfbps that apparently serve several biological functions. the vast majority of  xxxg1144xxx  (99%) is
bound to igfbp3 or  xxxg1150xxx  and is coupled with a
glycoprotein called the acid labile subunit (baxter, 1993;
twigg and baxter, 1998). however, the full repertoire of
biological implications ascribed to “free” versus bound
 xxxg1144xxx  has yet to be determined.
two distinct tissue sources of  xxxg1144xxx  production separate its functions. first, the liver generates  xxxg1144xxx , which
acts as an extension of the gh axis by virtue of tonic
pituitary stimulation of hepatic synthesis (maiter et al.,
1988). in fact, gh, in concert with nutritional factors,
represents the major determinant of circulating  xxxg1144xxx 
levels (oster et al., 1995). in this regard,  xxxg1144xxx  functions
in a manner characteristic of other endocrine pathways.
second,  xxxg1144xxx  is also produced locally by many peripheral cell types under basal conditions and in response to
inflammatory cues. in this case,  xxxg1144xxx  acts on peripheral
tissues as an autocrine or paracrine factor resembling
cytokines and other growth factors.
whatever the source of  xxxg1144xxx , responses to it are frequently mediated through the moderately high-affinity
association it displays for  xxxg1145xxx  (leroith et al., 1995;
adams et al., 2000). in other situations, members of the
igfbp family bind  xxxg1144xxx , in some cases at higher affinities than those occurring with  xxxg1145xxx .  xxxg1144xxx /igfbp
complex formation can produce signal initiation. alternatively, formation of these complexes can limit the
occupation by  xxxg1144xxx  of  xxxg1145xxx  and impose limits on
cellular responses dependent on  xxxg1145xxx  activation.
thus, igfbps,  xxxg1144xxx , and  xxxg1145xxx  form an important
pathway that can exert substantial self-regulation and
can form endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine loops
through which these molecules exert their biological impact. a number of factors influence the turnover of igfs.
among these are the relative levels of both proteases
and protease inhibitors found in the microenvironment
of target cells. proteases directed at  xxxg1144xxx  and specific
igfbps can promote the degradation and clearance of
the growth factor (roth et al., 1984; bhaumick and bala,
1987; misbin and almira, 1989; cwyfan hughes et al.,
1992; myers et al., 1993; timmins et al., 1996; skjaerbaek et al., 1998). some of these proteases are regulated
by  xxxg1144xxx  itself (myers et al., 1993). modulation of these
enzymes must then be considered potentially important
determinants of the biological activity of  xxxg1144xxx . the
 xxxg1144xxx  structural variant,  xxxg1144xxx  des 1–3, can also be
generated as a consequence of proteolytic digestion
(maake et al., 1997). this analog represents an igf-irspecific activator that lacks the n-terminal three amino
acids (bagley et al., 1989; ross et al., 1989; yamamoto
and murphy, 1995; jansson et al., 1997). it exhibits high
affinity for the type i receptor but does not bind

or activate the igfbps. moreover, it is more active than
 xxxg1144xxx  in terms of its receptor-dependent signaling (jansson et al., 1997). the proteolytic fragmentation of  xxxg1144xxx 
into des 1–3 seems to be regulated in part by the serine
protease inhibitor spi 2.1, which is down-regulated in
gh-deficient rodents (maake et al., 1997). this finding
suggests a potential mechanism for regulating the availability of  xxxg1144xxx  in gh deficiency.
b. insulin-like growth factor-i receptors
type i  xxxg1145xxx  consists of 1368 amino acids (fig. 2)
and belongs to a family of relatively large transmembrane  xxxg2198xxx  receptors. these include the  xxxg1194xxx  (ir) and a third, orphan member, namely
ir-related receptor, the endogenous ligand for which has
yet to be identified (leroith et al., 1995). these proteins
share considerable structural similarities (lawrence et
al., 2007). the extracellular domain of  xxxg1145xxx , which is
the site of constitutive receptor dimerization, can be
subdivided into six protein domains. these include two
l domains (l1 and l2) located in the n terminus, a
cysteine-rich domain, and three fibronectin domains,
termed fniii. the second of the fibronectin domains
contains a cleavage site between residues 708 and 710.
cleavage at this site results in the formation of two
polypeptides,  xxxg1145xxx ␣ and  xxxg1145xxx ␤, that are linked by
disulfide bonds. the residues determining  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg1146xxx  binding apparently reside in the l1 and second
fniii domains (whittaker et al., 2001; sørensen et al.,

fig. 2. schematic of the  xxxg1145xxx  dimer demonstrating the distribution
of domains across ␣ and ␤ chains and the location of ␣-␤ disulfides and
␣-␣ dimer disulfide bonds. [adapted from clemmons dr (2001)  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor-mediated signal transduction, in targets for  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx 
and  xxxg1144xxx  action (bouillon r ed), pp 17–28, bioscientifica ltd., bristol,

2004).  xxxg1145xxx  was established as a protein distinct from
ir some 35 years ago (megyesi et al., 1975). its critical
importance to normal development and physiology is
underscored by the neonatal lethality resulting from a
complete absence of  xxxg1145xxx  (liu et al., 1993). on the
other hand, after the conclusion of linear growth in
mammals, its functions seem less critical. at that stage,
 xxxg1145xxx  serves other important functions, such as secondarily regulating carbohydrate metabolism and perhaps influencing immune function. among the potential
ligands, it binds  xxxg1144xxx  with the highest affinity but also
displays appreciable avidity for  xxxg1146xxx  and insulin. the
affinities for these latter two ligands are 1 and 2 orders
of magnitude lower, respectively, than the affinity for
 xxxg1144xxx . type ii  xxxg1145xxx , which has been shown to be
identical to the cation-independent  xxxd1292xxx  receptor (kornfeld, 1992; hassan, 2003), binds
 xxxg1146xxx  with the greatest avidity but can also bind  xxxg1144xxx .
unlike the type i receptor, type ii  xxxg1145xxx  fails to bind
insulin. its signaling potential is considered relatively
minor. rather, it may function to promote ligand clearance. it represents a single membrane-spanning domain-containing glycoprotein (ghosh et al., 2003). the
extracellular domain comprises 15 cysteine-rich repeats,
whereas the carboxyl terminus is quite short. two distinct binding sites accommodate  xxxg1146xxx  and mannose-6phosphate (braulke, 1999). type i and ii receptors may
mediate erk 1/2 phosphorylation provoked by  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg1146xxx , respectively (el-shewy et al., 2007). by knocking
down type i  xxxg1145xxx , the activation of erk p42/44 elicited
by  xxxg1144xxx  is substantially abrogated, whereas that of
 xxxg1146xxx  persists. in contrast, interfering with the type ii
receptor had little effect on  xxxg1144xxx  signaling to erk,
whereas the activities of  xxxg1146xxx  on the activation of this
kinase were reduced. thus, type i and ii receptors might
function independently with regard to erk activation,
and  xxxg1146xxx  might exert at least some of its actions
through the type ii receptor (el-shewy et al., 2007). the
signaling initiated through  xxxg1145xxx  begins with a conformational change provoked by receptor ligation and involves a number of well used pathways in tissues in
which  xxxg1144xxx  exerts its actions. in solution, type i  xxxg1145xxx 
can bind three molecules of  xxxg1144xxx  (whitten et al., 2009).
moreover, binding of the ligand to this receptor results
in relatively little structural movement and may be limited to local rotation of protein domains.
cell-surface  xxxg1145xxx  levels are regulated by the relative expression of its gene (leroith et al., 1995; werner
et al., 1995). a number of factors seem to determine
expression, depending on the cell-type (du et al., 1999,
2001; maile and clemmons, 2003). in turn, those levels
of receptor expression govern key cellular processes such
as apoptosis. for instance, in vascular smooth-muscle
cells, oxidative stress diminishes receptor levels through
a mechanism involving enhanced association of p53 with
the  xxxg1145xxx  gene promoter (kavurma et al., 2007).
 xxxg1145xxx  signals to multiple antiapoptotic pathways, and

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

its overexpression generally enhances cell survival.
moreover,  xxxg1145xxx  seems necessary for malignant cell
transformation in some models of carcinogenesis, such
as the ewing’s family of tumors (toretsky et al., 1997).
in prostate cancer cells,  xxxg1145xxx  activation leads to the
initiation of downstream mtor signaling regulating the
expression of survivin (vaira et al., 2007), a member of
the inhibitor of apoptosis gene family and an important
regulator of cell proliferation and viability (ambrosini et
al., 1997). by introducing the dominant-negative mutant 486/stop  xxxg1145xxx  into m12 prostate cancer cells
expressing high levels of wild-type  xxxg1145xxx , wu et al.
(2003) enhanced apoptosis through actions mediated by
 xxxg1368xxx  (mapk).
recent studies reveal that the levels of cell-surface
 xxxg1145xxx  are also governed by regulatory events occurring
at the surface of the plasma membrane. as with multiple other  xxxg2198xxx  receptors, ligand-induced endocytosis serves an important function in signaling
through the recruitment of several proteins, including
the adaptor protein 2 (ap-2) complex, dynamin, endophilin, and clathrin (mellman, 1996; schmid et al.,
1998). the requisite recognition determinates for complex assembly have been localized. they are contained in
the eh domain of the n terminus of epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr) pathway substrate, eps15, a
100-amino acid signature that is repeated three times
(salcini et al., 1997). eps15 has been linked to egfr
endocytosis (benmerah et al., 1998). a family of four eh
domain-containing proteins has been identified, termed
ehd1-ehd4 (mintz et al., 1999). these ehd domains
are located in the c termini. rotem-yehudar et al.
(2001) have implicated ehd1 in the endocytosis of  xxxg1145xxx , in association with snap29. in their study, the
authors demonstrate that a complex containing clathrin,
␣-adaptin of ap-2, small nuclear rna-activating protein, and ehd1 colocalize to the endocytic vesicles.
over-expression of ehd1 retards the phosphorylation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase and akt and dampens
 xxxg1144xxx -provoked signaling substantially in transfected
chinese hamster ovary cells (rotem-yehudar et al.,
2001).
the immediate consequence of  xxxg1145xxx  activation involves tyrosine autophosphorylation at several residues
resulting from intrinsic  xxxg2198xxx  activity in the ␤
subunit (kato et al., 1993). phosphorylation of tyrosine
residues 1131, 1135, and 1136 plays important roles in
the canonical signaling attributed to the receptor (grønborg et al., 1993; kato et al., 1994). these protein modifications in turn create binding sites for multiple docking proteins (craparo et al., 1995; dey et al., 1996).
among these are the  xxxg1194xxx  substrates (irs)-1,
-2, -3, and -4 and the src homology and collagen domain
protein p66 shc (fig. 3).  xxxg1198xxx  contains 21 tyrosine
residues and serves a prominent role by interacting with
several src homology-2 (sh-2)-containing proteins involved in downstream signaling. the phosphorylation of

 xxxg1198xxx  leads to phosphoinositol kinase 3/akt activation
and the adaptor protein grb-2, which contains both
sh-2 and sh-3 domains. phosphoinositol kinase 3/akt
can associate with  xxxg1198xxx , and the grb-2 can bind the
guanine nucleotide-releasing protein son-of-sevenless,
which in turn participates in ras activation (egan et al.,
1993), leading to phosphorylation of the  xxxg1377xxx ,  xxxg1924xxx , and various components of the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase pathway (kecha et
al., 2000). in addition, several  xxxd1075xxx  phosphatases have been implicated in regulating  xxxg1144xxx  signaling. for instance, sh-2-containing  xxxd1075xxx 
phosphatase-2 ( xxxg1894xxx ) governs the duration of  xxxg1145xxx 
phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells (maile and
clemmons, 2002a,b,c).
multiple factors exert powerful regulatory influences
on  xxxg1144xxx -mediated signaling, insights that remain incompletely explored (nagaoka et al., 1990; lecka-czernik et al., 2007; martin and baxter, 2007; o’connor et
al., 2008). notable among them are abundant components of the extracellular matrix. when fibroblasts are
cultured on fibronectin-coated culture surfaces, the
abundance of  xxxg1198xxx  increases (lebrun et al., 2000),
whereas a substratum rich in  xxxg2422xxx  facilitates its
phosphorylation through interactions with focal adhesion kinase pp125 (lebrun et al., 1998). apparently,
 xxxg1145xxx  can associate with multiple integrins, and these
interactions are cell-specific. the activation of ␣3␤1 by
 xxxg1144xxx  in breast cancer cells can be up-regulated by plating them on a substratum enriched with thrombospondin (chandrasekaran et al., 1999). the integrin
receptor ␣v␤3 regulates  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation by influencing the rate of  xxxg1894xxx  recruitment to the receptor
complex (maile and clemmons, 2002a,b,c). a dynamic
interplay exists between  xxxg1145xxx  and the transmembrane proteins shps-1, a docking protein, and the ␣v␤3
integrin (clemmons and maile, 2005). in lens epithe-

204

smith

lium, the receptor coprecipitates with ␣6 (walker et al.,
2002), whereas in human chondrocytes, it associates
with ␣1␤1 and ␣5␤1 (shakibaei et al., 1999). it seems
that ␣v␤3 must be ligated to allow  xxxg1145xxx  to fully influence vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and
migration. blocking ␣v␤3 with the monoclonal antibody
lm609 attenuates  xxxg1144xxx -dependent cell migration. a
critical component to this signaling concerns the recruitment of  xxxg1894xxx .  xxxg1894xxx  is subsequently transferred to
shps-1. this reaction requires that the latter become
tyrosine-phosphorylated through an  xxxg1145xxx -dependent
event (pollak et al., 2004). blocking the interaction between ligands and ␣v␤3 enhances  xxxg1894xxx  binding to
 xxxg1145xxx , causing dephosphorylation of the receptor’s tyrosine residues and dampening the signaling mediated
through map kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
pathways (maile and clemmons, 2002a,b,c). the phosphorylation of tyrosines 785 and 773 on ␤3 seems critical
to  xxxg1144xxx -dependent map kinase signaling and cell proliferation (ling et al., 2003). conversely,  xxxg1144xxx  activity
enhances the avidity with which ␣v␤3 binds ligands
without altering maximum receptor binding capacity
(jones et al., 1996).
another regulatory phosphatase, protein tyrosine
phosphatase 1b, can also reduce the levels of  xxxg1145xxx 
phosphorylation (buckley et al., 2002). unlike the
closely related egfr and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, ir and  xxxg1145xxx  fail to bind sh-2-domain-containing proteins but instead drive the phosphorylation of
irs and shc proteins (white, 1997). moreover, a number
of potentially seminal findings have suggested that a
cooperative relationship between  xxxg1145xxx  and egfr in
signaling patterns exists and may prove to be cell typespecific (roudabush et al., 2000). these receptors, separately and in aggregate, may form “clearing houses” for
converging signals derived from a wide array of crosstalking pathways, including those involved in the actions of multiple hormones, cytokines, growth factors,
agents of cell stress, and oxidative events (rosen and
greenberg, 1996; rosette and karin, 1996; moro et al.,
1998; carpenter, 1999; hackel et al., 1999; luttrell et
al., 1999). in particular,  xxxg1144xxx  can promote erk phosphorylation through the intermediate activation of shc.
this series of events might require  xxxg1145xxx  dependent
egfr trans-activation (roudabush et al., 2000). it is
noteworthy that el-shewy et al. (2004) have recently
proposed a model in which the generation of egfr
ligands provoked by  xxxg1145xxx  activation results in the
trans-activation signaling of egfr. this, in turn, leads
to cell type-specific downstream signaling events. by
transfecting an expression plasmid encoding heparin
binding- xxxg681xxx -like growth factor/influenza virus hemagglutinin/myc into human embryonic
kidney 293 cells, they demonstrated that  xxxg1144xxx  elicited
the rapid proteolysis of the fusion protein. furthermore,
 xxxg1144xxx , egf, and heparin binding-egf-like growth factor could all enhance tyr-1068 phosphorylation of en-

dogenous egfr and mimic egf in driving egfr internalization from the cell surface (el-shewy et al., 2004).
the paracrine nature of this relationship was established
by demonstrating that  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ cells could respond to
stimulation as did  xxxg1145xxx ⫺ cells in coculture. responses of
these receptor-null cells were abolished by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases and egfr activation.
 xxxg1145xxx  may also serve as a substrate for ␥-secretase.
mcelroy et al. (2007) have demonstrated that a 52-kda
c-terminal fragment of  xxxg1145xxx  is generated both constitutively and at an increased level after treatment of
mouse embryo fibroblasts with phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13acetate. generation of the fragment, an appropriate substrate for ␥-secretase, is presumed to be proceeded by
the shedding of  xxxg1145xxx  from the membrane surface.
this would be mediated by one or more metalloproteinases, such as those belonging to the disintegrin and
metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (adams)
family. the authors tested whether the putative c-terminal fragment of  xxxg1145xxx  was indeed a ␥-secretase substrate by treating cells with compound e, a specific
inhibitor of the enzyme. the compound enhanced accumulation of the 52-kda protein but limited production of
the expected 50-kda intracellular domain fragment that
should result from ␥-secretase cleavage activity (mcelroy et
al., 2007). in aggregate, based on these studies,  xxxg1145xxx 
signaling activity and abundance at the cell- surface
seems to be regulated through a number of mechanisms
involving interactions with a diverse array of molecules.
these would include proteases involved in protein cleavage and recruitment of docking proteins.
c. insulin-like growth factor-i binding proteins
in addition to the relative concentrations of igfs and
the cell-surface density of  xxxg1145xxx , the abundance and
profile of igfbps serve as important determinants of
signaling by influencing igf availability for binding to
the receptor. the igfbp family comprises six proteins
exhibiting relatively high affinity for igfs. in fact, their
affinities for  xxxg1144xxx  generally exceed that of  xxxg1145xxx . they
are synthesized by many tissues and cell types, and
their relative levels are under hormonal control. for
instance, sex steroids regulate igfbp synthesis in
breast, granulosa cells, and cultured osteoblasts (mondschein et al., 1990). in addition to their relative levels
determining the biological impact of  xxxg1144xxx , igfbps can
undergo post-translational processing, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. each of
these protein modifications can profoundly alter igfbp
binding activity. besides their functions as  xxxg1144xxx  carrier
proteins, igfpbs exert actions on target cells, either as
ligated or unligated molecules (hwa et al., 1999). notable among them is igfbp3, which has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of several forms of cancer, including
that of the prostate (pollak et al., 2004). it is by virtue of
the wide array of proteases associated with prostate
cancer that igfbp3 is degraded, freeing  xxxg1144xxx  in the

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

process. specific proteases have been identified for each
igfbp. among these are cathepsin, various matrix metalloproteinases, stromelysins, and kallikreins (blat et
al., 1994; mañes et al., 1997, 1999).
igfbps generally serve to modulate growth factor
activity, in large part by sequestering  xxxg1144xxx  and therefore determining the fraction that is available to act on
target cells (rosenfeld et al., 2000). most of these circulate as approximately 150-kda complexes containing an
acid-labile subunit, igfbp, and  xxxg1144xxx . after the dissociation of this three-component aggregate,  xxxg1144xxx /igfbp
comes out of circulation and crosses the endothelium to
associate with target cell surface  xxxg1145xxx . with regard to
its abundance and contribution to  xxxg1144xxx  carrying capacity, igfbp3 is the most important (firth and baxter,
2002). igfbps can also enhance  xxxg1144xxx  activity, perhaps
by facilitating its delivery to target cells (wetterau et al.,
1999). as a complex,  xxxg1144xxx  survival in the circulation is
prolonged, its interactions with  xxxg1145xxx  are modulated,
and the igfbps might help target specific cells for  xxxg1144xxx 
action. moreover, igfbps help create concentration gradients for  xxxg1144xxx  and therefore determine the factor’s
impact on microenvironments surrounding target cells.
while a number of the biological effects ascribed to
igfbps are dependent upon their association with
 xxxg1144xxx  or  xxxg1146xxx  (jones and clemmons, 1995; rajaram et
al., 1997), increasing interest has driven further investigation into those actions that are  xxxg1144xxx -independent.
in addition to their roles as chaperones for  xxxg1144xxx , at
least some of the igfbps seem to act in the absence of
bound  xxxg1144xxx  (i.e., in an unligated state). they bind multiple extracellular matrix components (firth and baxter, 2002). for instance,  xxxg1148xxx  contains an arg-glyasp (rgd) integrin recognition site situated in the
carboxyl terminus (drop et al., 1992) through which it
can bind to the fibronectin receptor ␣5␤1 (jones et al.,
1993). igfbp2 possesses a similar motif. in addition, a
basic heparin-binding sequence in the thyroglobulin-like
domains resembles those found in igfbp-3,  xxxg1150xxx ,
and igfbp-6. igfbp-3 interacts with the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans (baxter and firth, 1995;
fowlkes and serra, 1996). similar domains on other
igfbps allow analogous interactions on cell surfaces
and within the extracellular matrix (parker et al., 1996,
1998), although little insight currently exists concerning
their biological function. one potential consequence of this
basic heparin-binding domain concerns modulating the
degradation of another related protein,  xxxg1149xxx , the effects of which seem to be opposed by  xxxg1144xxx  (verschure et
al., 1996). it is possible that the basic region of igfbps
inhibits protease activity (fowlkes et al., 1997).
igfbp3-provoked signaling seems to use  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor x, a nuclear transcription factor, to which it
binds with relatively high affinity (lee and cohen,
2002). this binding protein complexes with rxr-␣
within the cell nucleus (liu et al., 2000). moreover,
igfbp3-induced apoptosis is abolished in cells in which

205

rxr-␣ is knocked out. thus, the aggregate of rxr and
igfbp3 proteins conveys functional importance. in addition, specific membrane binding of igfbp3 has been
demonstrated in chick embryonic cells (delbé et al.,
1991), hs578t (oh et al., 1993) and mcf-7 breast cancer cells (ricort et al., 2002). the type v tgf-␤ receptor
can bind igfbp3 (leal et al., 1999). a putative 420-kda
membrane receptor for  xxxg1150xxx  that exhibits serine kinase activity has been demonstrated on osteoblasts (andress, 1995; berfield et al., 2000).  xxxg1150xxx  can also associate with  xxxd3301xxx , which in turn attenuates the integrin
associated protein- xxxd3301xxx  complex and therefore diminishes  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation and activity (moralez et
al., 2005). igfbp3 directly induces  xxxd1075xxx 
phosphatase activity in mcf-7 cells (ricort and binoux,
2002). thus, it is possible that this protein exerts its
modulating influence on  xxxg1144xxx  signaling by dampening
tyrosine phosphorylation (ricort and binoux, 2001).
iii. emerging insights into insulin-like growth
factor-i and insulin-like growth factor-i
receptor: roles in immune integration
although endocrine function is intimately intertwined
with growth and development, the potential relationship
between immune function and growth factors such as
 xxxg1144xxx  has remained poorly characterized until relatively
recently. with the growing realization that diverse regulatory pathways often converge, a number of studies
have demonstrated the importance of gh,  xxxg1144xxx , and
 xxxg1145xxx  to many aspects of immune function. in addition,
immune reactions and the inflammation with which
they are often linked have been shown to affect normal
growth and patterns of tissue remodeling occurring in
wound repair. although these interactions could have
been predicted from the well known deleterious effects of
chronic inflammatory disease on child growth and development, we now have gained critical insights into
their mechanistic basis. linking these biological functions is the complex interplay between cytokines and
growth factors, including  xxxg1144xxx . this topic has been
reviewed recently (o’connor et al., 2008). in brief, proinflammatory cytokines seem to dampen several components of the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway. many of the cytokines share
common signaling components, such as the erk 1/2 map
kinase. thus, molecular events initiating signaling
down a common pathway can modify the availability
and activities of shared postreceptor docking proteins
and thereby influence the magnitude and quality of cellular responses emanating from receptor/ligand interactions. as an example, levels of  xxxg1144xxx  trend downward as
a consequence of aging and chronic disease (moldawer
and copeland, 1997; grounds, 2002). thus, if all other
factors remain constant, the influence exerted by the
endogenous  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway on immune function
and inflammation mediated through the signaling pathways shared with  xxxg1145xxx  might diminish as an individ-

ual ages or becomes chronically ill. conversely, children
diagnosed with one of several diseases associated with
chronic illness exhibit alterations in growth and development attributable to gh/ xxxg1144xxx  dysfunction.
a. hematopoiesis
soon et al. (1999) reported findings from studies examining how  xxxg1145xxx  and il-4r signaling interact in 32d
myeloid precursor cells. these  xxxg1177xxx -dependent cells express ir but lack both  xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxg1199xxx . il-4 fails to elicit
any response in 32d cells. however, when either  xxxg1198xxx  or
 xxxg1199xxx  is coexpressed with il-4r, the cells respond to il-4
robustly (wang et al., 1993). when  xxxg1145xxx  is overexpressed in 32d cells, the activated receptor initiates dna
synthesis. it is noteworthy that  xxxg1145xxx  transfectants were
also responsive to il-4 in the absence of either  xxxg1198xxx  or
 xxxg1199xxx  (soon et al., 1999). the effects of  xxxg1144xxx  and il-4
seemed synergistic and were unrelated to changes in  xxxg1743xxx 
kinase activity, but the src-homology-collagen/grb2/
mapk pathway played a critical role (soon et al., 1999).
moreover, c-myc gene up-regulation and enhanced  xxxg1366xxx 
and  xxxg2217xxx  activities were positively correlated with the
effect of il-4 on cell proliferation in these  xxxg1145xxx  transfectants. higf-i promotes hematopoietic growth in vivo in
mice (tsarfaty et al., 1994). in mouse syngeneic bone marrow transplant models, gh and  xxxg1144xxx  administration enhances reconstitution of the immune system (murphy et
al., 1992a,b,c; de mello-coelho et al., 1997). recombinant
gh also enhances hematopoietic reconstitution after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice (tian et al.,
1998). using three different but extensively characterized mouse models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, alpdogan et al. (2003) demonstrated that
cd4⫺cd8⫺cd3⫺thy⫺1.2⫹ lymphoid and myeloid reconstitution after marrow transplantation was enhanced by
 xxxg1144xxx . in that study, thymic precursor cell populations
were expanded by  xxxg1144xxx  administration (alpdogan et al.,
2003). the cd25⫹cd44⫹cd4⫺cd8⫺cd3⫺thy⫺1.2⫹ and
cd25⫹cd44⫺cd4⫺cd8⫺cd3⫺thy⫺1.2⫹ subsets were increased. on the other hand, overall thymic cellularity was
unaffected.  xxxg1144xxx  increased the frequency of splenic myeloid cells and pro-b, pre-b, and mature b cells in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients. donor-derived peripheral splenic cd3⫹t cells became more abundant and
exhibited enhanced proliferative responses to mitogens.
moreover, the effects of  xxxg1183xxx  on b cells were substantially
promoted by  xxxg1144xxx  but not those actions exerted on t cells.
the study also examined the impact of  xxxg1144xxx  on the development of graft-versus-host reactions in both mhc
matched and mismatched hosts and found no effects on
either morbidity or mortality among the animals (alpdogan et al., 2003).
b. thymus development and function
regulation of thymic development and physiologic
function involves numerous intersecting molecular signals. although it was thought to function only in child-

hood, much evidence now supports the concept that thymic activity persists well into adulthood (poulin et al.,
1999). moreover, certain pathological states seem to promote increased activity within the thymus (choyke et
al., 1987; mccune et al., 1998). among the supporting
factors,  xxxg1144xxx  and gh target thymic epithelial cells,
where they synergistically promote the action of anticd3 in stimulating proliferation (savino et al., 2002).
kooijman et al. (1995a,b,c) reported that human thymocytes display 257 ⫾ 28  xxxg1144xxx  binding sites/cell with a kd
of 0.12 ⫾ 0.01 nm. precursor thymocytes represent pluripotential cd3⫺cd4⫺cd8⫺ cells that differentiate into
mature cd3⫹cd4⫹cd8⫺ or cd3⫹cd4⫺cd8⫹ phenotypes. mature thymocytes express  xxxg1145xxx . immature
cells (cd4⫺cd8⫺) display 3- to 4-fold higher receptor
levels than do immature cd3⫺/lowcd4⫹cd8⫹ cells and
mature cd4⫹cd8⫺ or cd4⫺cd8⫹ cells.  xxxg1144xxx  directly
stimulates dna synthesis in human thymocytes (kooijman et al., 1995a,b,c). besides thymocytes, gh and
 xxxg1144xxx  have been shown to regulate nonlymphoid components of the thymus. thymic epithelial cells from human
and murine sources express  xxxg1145xxx  mrna, as do established cell lines (de mello-coelho et al., 1997). in culture,
 xxxg1144xxx  induces the synthesis of the zinc-binding nanopeptide serum thymic factor (i.e., thymulin) in human thymic epithelial cells (timsit et al., 1992; de mello-coelho
et al., 1997). the authors of these studies found that the
plasma levels of thymulin were increased significantly
in 21 patients with acromegaly compared with 30 control
subjects (timsit et al., 1992). the effects of  xxxg1144xxx  on the
thymic cell population are time-dependent and seem
specific. moreover, the cross-talk between the thymic
epithelium and lymphoid cells can be modulated by gh
through  xxxg1144xxx  (de mello-coelho et al., 1997).  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg1145xxx  mrna can be detected in murine and human
thymic epithelial cells (de mello coelho et al., 2002). gh
enhances  xxxg1144xxx  synthesis in murine and human thymic
epithelial cells. moreover, treatment of these cells with
 xxxg1144xxx  results in increased cd4⫺cd8⫺cd90⫹ (thy-1⫹) t
cell adhesion, suggesting the possibility that the growth
factor might indirectly influence intrathymic t cell differentiation and migration (de mello coelho et al., 2002).
atrophy of the thymus is a recognized consequence of
substantial insulin deficits in diabetes mellitus. the thymic atrophy found in animal models of insulin-deficient
diabetes can be reversed with exogenous  xxxg1144xxx  at doses
insufficient for restoring glycemic control (binz et al.,
1990). that result suggests the possibility that  xxxg1144xxx ,
and perhaps insulin, might exert actions on the thymus
that are independent of their impact on blood glucose
levels. both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  can increase the number of
cd4⫹cd8⫹ immature t cells in rat thymus and spleen
(hinton et al., 1998). they also enhance repopulation of
atrophic thymus after cyclosporine treatment (beschorner et al., 1991). although  xxxg1144xxx  failed to prevent glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis in rats, it reduced the death rate among lymphocytes in the spleen

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

and protected modestly splenic b and t cell loss (hinton
et al., 1998). it also enhanced the recovery of cd4⫹cd8⫹
immature intrathymic t cells and depressed the abundance of cd8⫹ cells (hinton et al., 1998). when administered to 9-month-old male mice, both splenic and thymic weights increased, and these tissues contained
substantially increased numbers of cd4⫹ t cells (clark
et al., 1993). in addition, splenic b cells were also more
numerous in these animals. gh helps reverse age-related decline of thymopoiesis in animal models (clark et
al., 1993; kelley et al., 1996; clark, 1997). in adult
patients infected with hiv-1, gh increased thymic mass
and the abundance of circulating cd4⫹ t cells (napolitano et al., 2002). in a considerably more comprehensive
prospective clinical trial, these same investigators reexamined gh effects in adults infected with hiv-1 (napolitano et al., 2008). they concluded that the thymic
output was increased because the frequency of circulating naive and total t cells was elevated, as was t cell
receptor rearrangement excision circles (napolitano et
al., 2008). those findings imply that gh might reverse
thymic involution in immunodeficient human subjects
and therefore its administration might constitute therapy. although the administration of hgh and rigf-i in
patients infected with hiv failed to influence significantly the abundance of cd4⫹ t cells, alter the profile of
ra and ro cd4⫹ subsets, or affect several other immunologic endpoints, the authors of a pilot study concluded
that these agents could modestly improve hiv-specific
immune function (nguyen et al., 1998). these observations could carry broader implications concerning a
strategy for preserving immune function in the context
of various disease processes such as retroviral illness
and the decline resulting from normal aging.
c. immunocoordination
besides their impact on discrete components of the
immune system,  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  seem to modify several aspects of inflammation, at least in part by influencing the actions of cytokines and other small molecule
mediators. these same mediators can in turn alter the
abundance of  xxxg1144xxx  and modulate its actions on target
tissues. thus various components of the inflammatory
machinery and the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway share a complex relationship that manifests in several ways. as an example,  xxxg1144xxx  can increase survival in rats treated with
d-galactosamine and lps, a strategy used to induce
experimental acute hepatic failure (hijikawa et al.,
2008). when administered before the d-galactosamine
and lps,  xxxg1144xxx  prevented the biochemical stigmata of
liver failure, such as elevations in bilirubin and
transaminases. upon histologic examination, the growth
factor seemed to decrease hepatic apoptosis and neutrophil infiltration. this effect seems to result from  xxxg1144xxx 
blocking the elevation of il-1␤, tnf-␣, and neutrophil
chemoattractant 1 associated with d-galactosamine and
lps administration.  xxxg1144xxx  additionally reduces the pro-

207

duction of nitrous oxide by inhibiting the inductive effects of lps and d-galactosamine on  xxxd2738xxx  synthase mrna and protein levels in the liver. these
effects seem to be independent of nuclear factor-␬b (hijikawa et al., 2008). when tnf-␣ signaling in skeletal
muscle is activated through the c- xxxg1370xxx , the signal activity provoked by  xxxg1144xxx  can be attenuated through changes induced in the conformation of
 xxxg1198xxx  and its phosphorylation (grounds et al., 2008). in
children with extensive thermal burns, the administration of  xxxg1144xxx  in combination with igfbp3 as a continuous infusion at a rate of 1 to 4 mg/kg/day, reduced serum
levels of il-1␤, tnf-␣,  xxxg520xxx  (crp), ␣1-acid
glycoprotein, and complement c-3 (jeschke et al., 2000).
in contrast, the serum levels of retinol-binding proteins,
prealbumin, and transferrin were increased by the infusion. the inflammatory status of patients with peripheral arterial disease affects serum levels of  xxxg1144xxx  and
igfbp-3 (brevetti et al., 2008). in patients manifesting
either ulcerative colitis or crohn’s disease, circulating
levels of  xxxg1144xxx  are inversely correlated with erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and  xxxg520xxx  (street et al.,
2003). on the other hand, igfbp-2 levels are positively
correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
il-1␤ levels. in black male smokers,  xxxg1144xxx  levels are
inversely correlated with those of  xxxg520xxx  (colangelo et al., 2009).

iv. impact of insulin-like growth factor-i and
insulin-like growth factor-i receptor on
immune cell lineages
a. t lymphocytes
t cells display many different surface growth factor
receptors, including  xxxg1145xxx  (schillaci et al., 1998).
 xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg1146xxx , and insulin bind to the surface of t and b
cells. high-affinity binding sites for insulin (kd ⫽ 2 ⫻
10⫺10 m) were found by helderman and strom (1978) on
activated b and t cells, and ir was proposed by the
authors to represent a marker of lymphocyte activation.
lee et al. (1986) were among the first to demonstrate
 xxxg1145xxx  expression by some, but not all, t cell lines
derived from patients with lymphoid malignancies.
high-affinity, saturable binding of 125i- xxxg1144xxx  was subsequently demonstrated on both activated and resting
human t cells with a kd of 1.2 ⫻ 10⫺10 m (tapson et al.,
1988). the number of binding sites increases from approximately 45 high-affinity sites per resting cell to 330
sites per activated cell. moreover, those studies demonstrated that  xxxg1144xxx  can induce t-cell proliferation and
chemotaxis (tapson et al., 1988). the binding capacity
for  xxxg1144xxx  is greater on rat cd4⫹ compared with cd8⫹ t
cells. moreover, binding sites on cd8⫹ t cells seem to
exhibit a relatively lower affinity for the ligand than
those on their cd4⫹ counterparts (xu et al., 1995).
 xxxg1145xxx  levels displayed by rat lymphocytes increase af-

ter activation with  xxxd2620xxx  in both cd4⫹ and
cd8⫹ t cell subsets.
the consequences of  xxxg1145xxx  expression to lymphocyte
function have been examined in several different studies
employing a wide array of experimental models and
technical approaches. yang et al. (2002) studied human
cord blood lymphocytes and the impact of knocking down
 xxxg1145xxx  expression with antisense oligonucleotides on
cell function. they found that receptor abundance was
increased by cell activation with either phytohemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen and that reducing  xxxg1145xxx 
levels resulted in depressed cell proliferation and reduced igm production and cytokine expression (yang et
al., 2002). their studies apparently were conducted in
culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
but otherwise in the absence of  xxxg1144xxx . t-cell generation
in neonates focuses on maintaining a preset optimal
clonal size and is not necessarily geared toward attaining maximal repertoire diversity (schönland et al.,
2003). thus, naive t cells remain capable of cellular
replication, even late in life. a host of factors allowing
expansion supports attainment of the preset post-thymic
t cell clonal size. among them,  xxxg1183xxx  plays an important
role, especially during neonatal life, but may also exert
an influence during adulthood (schönland et al., 2003).
whether  xxxg1144xxx  and its signaling pathways also play
some role in determining how t-cell compartments are
filled throughout life remains an open question. however, given the importance of  xxxg1183xxx  in that process and
how  xxxg1144xxx  potentiates the actions of  xxxg1183xxx  in pro-b cell
expansion (gibson et al., 1993), a similar influence on t
cells seems likely.
both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  play important roles in the
development and function of t cells.  xxxg1144xxx  can activate t
cell akt and thereby enhance lymphocyte survival
(walsh et al., 2002). however, both  xxxg1144xxx  and insulin
can also suppress immune responses. in c57bl/6 mouse
splenocytes,  xxxg1144xxx  profoundly blocked il-2-dependent
cell growth (hunt and eardley, 1986). although not as
potent, insulin had similar effects. these were evident in
both t and b cell-enriched splenocyte preparations
treated with il-2 and were also observed in unfractionated splenocytes treated with  xxxd2620xxx  and lps.
the el4 thymoma cell line exhibited growth retardation
in response to  xxxg1144xxx  similar to that observed in primary
splenocytes, where the growth factor was 100 to 1000
times more potent than insulin. proliferation of the
mouse t cell line ctll2 cells is dependent on il-2 but is
inhibited by  xxxg1144xxx . these cells were less sensitive to the
inhibitory actions of  xxxg1144xxx  than were splenocytes. with
regard to responses in vitro, in a plaque-forming cell
assay,  xxxg1144xxx  and insulin suppressed antibody production (hunt and eardley, 1986). the suppressive effects
of  xxxg1144xxx  on il-2-dependent cell proliferation could not be
overcome with increasing concentrations of the latter
agent. the suppressive effects were time-dependent and
evolved over many hours of incubation. thus,  xxxg1144xxx  and

insulin, although generally enhancing lymphocyte proliferation (heulin et al., 1982; schimpff et al., 1983;
walsh et al., 2002), can also block il-2-dependent lymphocyte growth and function.
thymic  xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg1146xxx , and  xxxg1145xxx  mrnas are expressed as early as fetal day 14 in mice (kecha et al.,
2000). the  xxxg1146xxx  transcript declined in the postnatal period, but a weak reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction signal remained detectable at week 7 (kecha et
al., 2000). in that report, culture-based studies of fetal
thymic organ suggested that interruption of the  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg1146xxx  pathways results in potentially important and divergent effects on the differentiation of double-negative
cd4⫺cd8⫺ cells compared with cd4⫹cd8⫹ cells and
after their progression to mature cd4⫹cd8⫺ and
cd4⫺cd8⫹ phenotypes (kecha et al., 2000). when administered to animals,  xxxg1144xxx  expands the t-cell population (clark et al., 1993).  xxxg1146xxx  also enhances t-cell
development, as was strongly suggested in studies using
transgenic mice overexpressing that protein where human  xxxg1146xxx  production was under the control of the
h2kb gene promoter (kooijman et al., 1995a,b,c). transgenic thymus in 1-week-old mice from the two different
lines contained 36 and 68% more thymocytes than did
control animals (kooijman et al., 1995a,b,c). at 4 weeks
of age,  xxxg1146xxx  expression resulted in enhanced thymic
cellularity. this increase could be accounted for by the
emergence of more numerous early cd4⫺cd8⫺ and
cd4 ⫺cd8 dim cells, intermediate cd4 ⫹cd8 ⫹ cells,
and mature thymocytes with the cd3⫹cd4⫹cd8⫺ or
cd3⫹⫹cd4⫺cd8⫹ phenotypes. as the mice continued
to age, differences between thymocyte populations in
transgenic and control animals disappeared.
stage of maturation determines the level of  xxxg1145xxx 
displayed by developing t cells, as assessed by recognition with the specific monoclonal antibody ␣ir3. receptor density was quantified on human peripheral t cells
(kooijman et al., 1995a,b,c). eighty-seven percent of
cd4⫹cd45ra⫹ cells and 66% of cd8⫹cd45ra⫹ cells
stained for the receptor (kooijman et al., 1995a,b,c). in
contrast, 37 and 38% of the cd4⫹cd45ro⫹ and
cd8⫹cd45ro⫹ memory t cells, respectively, exhibited
the  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ phenotype (kooijman et al., 1995a,b,c). tcell expression of  xxxg1145xxx  undergoes down-regulation as differentiation proceeds. thus double-negative cd4⫺cd8⫺
cells exhibit 3- to 4-fold higher levels of surface receptor
display than do either double-positive or single-positive
cells.  xxxg1145xxx  levels were markedly lower in activated t
cells, both in vitro and in vivo. cd4⫹cd45ro⫹ cells
activated by phytohemagglutinin or after exposure to
recall antigens in vitro display considerably lower levels
of  xxxg1145xxx  than do inactive lymphocytes (kooijman et al.,
1995a,b,c; schillaci et al., 1998; segretin et al., 2003).
this reduction may be transient and associated with
depressed steady-state  xxxg1145xxx  mrna levels (segretin et
al., 2003). a similar finding could be demonstrated in
jurkat cells, and addition of  xxxg1144xxx  to the culture me-

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

dium enhanced this effect (schillaci et al., 1998). these
findings contrast with those reported by tapson et al.
(1988) and may reflect differences in experimental conditions or how cell maturation studies were performed.
in addition, monocyte-depleted peripheral human t
cells activated with immobilized  xxxd2676xxx  were found to
display up-regulated  xxxg1145xxx , igf-iir, and ir (johnson
et al., 1992). those cells proliferated in response to both
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx , effects that could be blocked with the
 xxxg1145xxx -blocking antibody ␣ir3.  xxxg1145xxx  expression can
also be up-regulated in t cells through cd28 receptor
cross-linking or by activating the  xxxg396xxx / xxxg398xxx  pathway
(walsh and o’connor, 2000). moreover, blocking  xxxg1145xxx 
on tcr- and cd28-engaged t cells decreases lymphocyte survival in the presence of il-2 (walsh and
o’connor, 2000). cd28 activation enhances  xxxg1145xxx  display on jurkat cells and treatment with  xxxg1144xxx  conveys
resistance to fas-mediated apoptosis (walsh and
o’connor, 2000).  xxxg1144xxx  enhances the maturation of t
cells collected from cord blood (tu et al., 2000) and
blocks spontaneous apoptosis and the programmed cell
death induced by phytohemagglutinin. it down-regulates interferon ␥ r2 chain display on the surface of
human t cells (bernabei et al., 2003), resulting in desensitization of these cells to interferon ␥-dependent
stat-1 signaling. it also activates akt (aka pkb) and
c-jun n-terminal kinases, resulting in resistance to fasmediated apoptosis (walsh et al., 2002). on the other
hand,  xxxg1144xxx  elicits the production of il-10 in human t
cells through a modest increase in il-10 mrna (kooijman and coppens, 2004). in cultured 32d hematopoietic
cells overexpressing  xxxg1145xxx , treatment with  xxxg1144xxx  and
il-4 enhanced dna synthesis in the absence of irs
expression (soon et al., 1999). the sh-2/grb2/mapk
pathway seems crucial to the mitogenic effects of both
agents.
activation of the signaling pathways downstream
from  xxxg1145xxx  and ir increases lymphocyte metabolism.
the overall capacity for increased energy turnover accompanying t-cell activation is regulated by insulin
(frauwirth and thompson, 2004). two signals provoke
cell activation: primary signals are directed through the
tcr/cd3 complex, and secondary signals are provided
by activated costimulatory receptors such as cd28
(parry et al., 1997; frauwirth et al., 2002). enhanced
glucose uptake is mediated through the transcriptional
up-regulation of the glut1 transporter accompanied by
the translocation of glut4 transporter to the cell surface
(barthel et al., 1999; wang et al., 1999). moreover there
is an overall shift to aerobic glycolysis (buttgereit et al.,
2000). oxygen demand after activation occurs rapidly
but is overshadowed by a shift to glycolysis. a major
consequence of the metabolic profile associated with cell
activation is accelerated lactate generation, similar to
that observed in tumor cells. the signaling downstream
from both ir and  xxxg1145xxx  is mediated through akt/pkb
(barthel et al., 1999). cd28 activation, like that of ir

209

and  xxxg1145xxx , culminates in the recruitment of akt to the
cell surface by phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate, where
it becomes phosphorylated through the actions of  xxxg1743xxx 
kinase-responsive kinase pdk-1.
aging rodents exhibit diminished responsiveness to
pathogens. this shift is associated with reduced cellularity and frank involution of the thymus (hadden et al.,
1992; miller, 1996; montecino-rodriguez and dorshkind, 1997; tian et al., 1998). a potential strategy for
reversing these senile changes in thymic vitality involves administration of either gh or  xxxg1144xxx . these
agents have been examined for their potential to expand
t-cell populations in animals. eighteen-month-old mice
were administered  xxxg1144xxx , bone marrow cells from
younger mice, or a combination of the two (montecinorodriguez et al., 1998). cellularity of the thymus in
animals receiving both was enhanced considerably more
than in those receiving only one of these treatments.
this report contained studies conducted in vitro, demonstrating that  xxxg1144xxx  might potentiate thymic colonization by t cells derived from the bone marrow (montecino-rodriguez et al., 1998). thus, alteration of the
hematopoietic as well as endocrine defects associated
with normal aging might reverse thymic involution.
dw/j dwarf mice produce less prolactin and gh than
is found in control mice (duquesnoy and pedersen,
1981). they also manifest abnormalities in t-cell development (fabris et al., 1971), including deficits in the
abundance of cd4⫹cd8⫹ thymic cells (murphy et al.,
1992a,b,c). treatment of these animals with gh could
restore the deficient t-cell progenitor pool within the
thymus, enlarge this gland, and enhance peripheral tcell function. these authors explored the impact of prolactin treatment in the same dw/j mice and reported
that its effects were markedly distinct from those of gh
(murphy et al., 1993). prolactin decreased further thymic cellularity but enhanced both the frequency and
activity of peripheral t lymphocytes in heterozygous and
dwarf mice. in contrast, gh administration had little
influence on antigen-specific responses (murphy et al.,
1993). gh did enhance human t-cell engraftment in
scid mice (murphy et al., 1992a,b,c). this was related
to increased resting and  xxxd2676xxx -activated t cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell
adhesion molecule-1, and fibronectin (taub et al., 1994).
moreover, analysis of the mechanisms involved revealed
that ␤1 integrin mediates binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin, whereas ␤2 is necessary
for adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1. furthermore, the impact of gh on increasing human t cell
engraftment could be blocked following preincubation
with anti-␤1 and anti-␤2 antibodies (taub et al., 1994).
the hormone could also up-regulate the random migration
of resting and activated human t cells, but the effects were
substantially less pronounced than those elicited by regulated upon activation, normal t-cell expressed ( xxxg363xxx ),

210

even when the concentration of  xxxg363xxx  was 100-fold
lower.
like many other regulatory molecules, states of resistance to the actions of  xxxg1144xxx  have been described, usually in the context of growth abnormalities (jain et al.,
1998). in a series of studies, geffner et al. (1993, 1995)
established a number of t and b cell lines derived from
adult efe pygmies or from lese farmers who are their
neighbors in zaire. the basis for the growth abnormalities found in efe pigmies concerns a substantially diminished compliment of  xxxg1145xxx  molecules on the cellsurface and an absence of receptor autophosphorylation
in response to physiological concentrations of  xxxg1144xxx 
(hattori et al., 1996). the stature attained by these lese
farmers is intermediate between those of urban black
africans and pygmies. interbreeding between these populations is known to occur. the investigators performed
clonal proliferation assays in which t cells from the two
populations and a third control cohort from north america were incubated with gh,  xxxg1144xxx , insulin, or appropriate
controls and cultures were enumerated after 4 to 7 days. t
cells from the efe pygmies were found to be completely resistant to the actions of  xxxg1144xxx . lese farmer-derived clones exhibited intermediate responses. on the other hand, responses to insulin were indistinguishable among the
three t cell donor sources, even when the concentrations
used were extremely high. the absence of attenuation in
the clones from pygmies was surprising to the authors
because they had demonstrated that responses to high
concentrations of insulin are usually mediated through
the promiscuous activation of  xxxg1145xxx  (geffner et al.,
1987, 1992). however, in the case of the pygmy-derived
clones,  xxxg1145xxx  apparently was uninvolved in the insulin
response (geffner et al., 1993). similar studies conducted in b cells from these same efe pygmy donors
revealed similar results:  xxxg1144xxx  failed to elicit responses,
even at extremely high concentrations (cortez et al.,
1996), despite the comparable responses in cells from all
three sources to  xxxd2925xxx .
b. b lymphocytes
b cells play diverse roles in immune function by virtue
of their further differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells, generation of cytokines, and their
importance in antigen presentation. a critical component of b-cell development concerns how committed precursor cells from the hematopoietic lineage undergo immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement (kincade et
al., 1989). this leads to the expression of light chains
and ultimately to the release of mature b cells from the
bone marrow. a number of exogenous factors emanating
from marrow stromal cells provide molecular support for
early b-cell proliferation. specifically, b-lineage progenitor cells in which ig gene rearrangement has already
been initiated, but before any detectable ig light or
heavy chains are produced, can undergo expansion in
the presence of  xxxg1183xxx  when cocultured with stromal cells.

among these stromal factors,  xxxg1144xxx  drives b-cell differentiation (landreth et al., 1992). in addition,  xxxg1144xxx  enhances  xxxg1183xxx -dependent b-cell proliferation in concert
with c-kit ligand (landreth et al., 1992) and potentiates
 xxxg1183xxx  promotion of pro-b-cell expansion (gibson et al.,
1993). cell lines derived from 14-day-old mouse fetal
liver cells proliferate when cocultured with stromal cells
cloned from s10 in the presence of  xxxg1183xxx . the proliferation of these lines could be enhanced with the addition of
either c-kit ligand or  xxxg1144xxx  (gibson et al., 1993). moreover, the effects of c-kit ligand and  xxxg1144xxx  were additive,
reflecting the distinct signaling pathways each used to
activate these cells. signaling components lying downstream from  xxxg1145xxx  may condition b-cell function and
responses to additional factors.  xxxg1198xxx  overexpression in
b lymphocytes derived from transgenic mice alters the
density-dependent production of ige and igg1 in vitro
and enhances ige responses in those animals (kellywelch et al., 2004). in contrast, il-4-mediated proliferation and its impact on apoptosis were unaffected in
mice harboring the  xxxg1145xxx  transgene. when administered in vivo,  xxxg1144xxx  enhances the population of intrasplenic b cells through increased proliferation of mature
cells (clark et al., 1993; jardieu et al., 1994). in bone
marrow, the number of b cells increased after  xxxg1144xxx 
administration in normal adult mice and those receiving
lethal irradiation followed by reconstitution with syngeneic bone marrow (jardieu et al., 1994). studies conducted in vitro disclose that the differentiation of human
cd34⫹ bone marrow cells was substantially impeded by
down-regulating the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway of ms-5 cells in
coculture (taguchi et al., 2006). these studies implicate
igfbp-6 as a necessary component of  xxxg1144xxx -dependent
b cell differentiation, whereas igfbp-3 acted as an inhibitor of that process.
plasma cells also respond to  xxxg1144xxx . dna synthesis
increases substantially in four myeloma cell lines
treated with  xxxg1144xxx  in vitro in the absence of il-6 (jelinek et al., 1997). in addition, both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx 
enhance the proliferative action of il-6 in three of these
cell lines. the effects were absent in normal b cells,
suggesting that the actions of  xxxg1144xxx  on b cells may
diverge in malignant cells. both  xxxg1145xxx  and ir are
expressed at higher levels by myeloma cell lines than
those found in b lymphoblastoid lines (freund et al.,
1994). plasma cell metabolism may also be targeted by
 xxxg1144xxx . in the rpmi 8226 line, cells express highaffinity binding sites for both insulin and  xxxg1144xxx 
(freund et al., 1993).  xxxg1144xxx  increases  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase activation, enhances dna
synthesis, and up-regulates lactate production in
these cells. in the  xxxg1182xxx ␣-expressing human myeloma
cell line nop2, il-6 induces phosphorylation of  xxxg1145xxx , an action that cannot be blocked with  xxxg1220xxx  inhibitors but is duplicated in  xxxg1182xxx  ␣ transfected u266 cells (abroun et al., 2004).
moreover,  xxxg1182xxx ␣ colocalizes with  xxxg1145xxx  in lipid

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

rafts. the authors of the study also reported that il-6 leads
to the activation of stat3,  xxxg1369xxx /2, and akt/pkb, which
they suggest is a consequence of  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation. these findings identify a potential molecular basis
for  xxxg1220xxx -independent il-6 signaling mediated
through  xxxg1145xxx . moreover, they define a mechanism for
cross-talk between two receptors that had been previously shown to independently support myeloma cells
and their biosynthetic activities.
 xxxg1144xxx  can also influence antibody expression and class
switching by plasma cells. for example, administration
of  xxxg1144xxx  to mice results in elevated levels of antibodies
(robbins et al., 1994). peripheral human b cells selectively bind  xxxg1144xxx  (stuart et al., 1991). the binding is
saturable and can be displaced with unlabeled  xxxg1144xxx  and
by high concentrations of insulin.  xxxg1144xxx  binds to a 130kda protein in b cells. human lymphoblasts synthesize
igfbp2 and  xxxg1149xxx  (neely et al., 1991). baudler et al.
(2005) reconstituted rag2-deficient c57bl/6 mice with
fetal liver cells from  xxxg1145xxx (⫺/⫺) mice. t-cell-independent humoral responses to the type 2 antigen 4-hydroxy3-nitrophenyl acetyl  xxxd3253xxx  were substantially diminished, whereas those against the t-cell-dependent
antigen 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl-chicken globulin
were unaltered. b-cell development remained normal in
 xxxg1145xxx -deficient chimeras, as did t-cell differentiation.
in these animals,  xxxg1144xxx  enhanced immunoglobulin production, an effect that proved independent of b-cell proliferation (baudler et al., 2005). kimata and yoshida
(1994a,b) examined human b cells from individuals undergoing tonsillectomies for chronic tonsillitis. in addition, they analyzed several epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, including gm-1056,
cess, gm-1500, gm-3332, skw, and cbl, and found
that both gh and  xxxg1144xxx  enhanced ig production in all of
these cell types. it is noteworthy that the actions of gh
were not dependent on an intermediate production of
 xxxg1144xxx  (kimata and yoshida, 1994a,b). these same authors reported that gh and  xxxg1144xxx  induce igg4 and ige
production in tonsillar b cells from control donors depleted of sige⫹, treatments that left iggm, igg1, igg2,
igg3, and iga production unaffected (kimata and fujimoto, 1994). unlike  xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg1146xxx  and insulin failed to
affect igg4 or ige synthesis. in these studies, too, the
actions of gh seem to be unrelated to  xxxg1144xxx  production,
because neutralizing antibodies directed against the
growth factor failed to attenuate the impact of gh. it
would seem, therefore, that  xxxg1144xxx  and gh may selectively induce igg4 and ige production through a classswitching mechanism (kimata and fujimoto, 1994). it is
possible that gh signals through pathways that are
independent of those involving the production of  xxxg1144xxx .
however, the absence of attenuation in studies in which
anti- xxxg1144xxx  antibodies are used to block gh actions does
not entirely rule out a role for  xxxg1144xxx . interferons ␣ and ␤
could block the induction by il-4 and il-13 of igg4 and
ige but not that of gh or  xxxg1144xxx . moreover, anti-cd40

211

antibodies failed to block the induction of ig by either
gh or  xxxg1144xxx  (kimata and fujimoto, 1994). thus, it
would seem that  xxxg1144xxx  and gh induce ig class-switching
in a manner that does not involve the il-4 or il-13
signaling pathways.
c. monocyte-macrophage lineage
human macrophages and granulocytes display  xxxg1145xxx . a number of  xxxg1144xxx  binding sites (1390 ⫾ 467) were
detected possessing a kd of 2.3 ⫾ 0.9 nm (kooijman et
al., 2002).  xxxg1144xxx  attenuated spontaneous apoptosis in
these cells. activated macrophages also express  xxxg1145xxx ,
whereas binding sites for 125i-labeled  xxxg1144xxx  were absent
on cells before activation (rom and pääkkö, 1991). this
binding was quenched with excess unlabeled growth
factor or with anti- xxxg1145xxx  monoclonal antibodies, attesting to its specificity. alveolar macrophages, obtained
from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, produce
a polypeptide growth factor that promotes fibroblast proliferation (bitterman et al., 1983). this factor was subsequently identified as  xxxg1144xxx  (rom et al., 1988). in that
study, the 26-kda macrophage-produced polypeptide was
neutralized with an anti- xxxg1144xxx  monoclonal antibody,
could displace 125i- xxxg1144xxx  from  xxxg1145xxx  on the surface of
human lung fibroblasts, and provoked the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on an artificial  xxxg1145xxx 
substrate. in contrast, circulating monocytes fail to
generate  xxxg1144xxx , but tissue-infiltrating cells can be
provoked to produce the growth factor by a number of
agents (rom et al., 1988; kirstein et al., 1992). these
act on macrophages through multiple signaling pathways. for instance,  xxxd1903xxx  induces  xxxg1144xxx 
expression through the generation of camp and the
activation of  xxxg1836xxx  (fournier et al., 1995).
colony-stimulating factors also induce in macrophages the synthesis of  xxxg1144xxx  at a pretranslational
level (arkins et al., 1993), as does tnf-␣ (fournier et
al., 1995).
it seems that in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease associated with increased fibroblast proliferation,
 xxxg1144xxx  levels correlate well with disease severity. the
production of  xxxg1144xxx  by macrophages in this disease may
determine, at least in part, disease severity (uh et al.,
1998). this is controlled by several factors, including
hyaluronan, acting through the surface receptor, cd44
(noble et al., 1993). induction of  xxxg1144xxx  by glycosaminoglycan was found to be mediated through an intermediate up-regulation of tnf-␣, an action that was enhanced
by il-1␤. on the other hand, interferon ␥ attenuates
 xxxg1144xxx  synthesis in rat macrophages by lowering levels of
its steady-state mrna. these actions are mediated at
the level of  xxxg1144xxx  gene transcription rather than as a
result of alterations in mrna stability (arkins et al.,
1995a,b,c). activation of the human macrophage-like
cell line u937 with either the ca2⫹ ionophore calcimycin
(a23187) or phorbol acetate, results in the up-regulation
of  xxxg1144xxx  gene transcription, as assessed by nuclear run-

212

smith

off assays (nagaoka et al., 1990). these actions require
ongoing intermediate protein synthesis. on the other
hand, steady-state levels of cytoplasmic  xxxg1144xxx  mrna
declined with macrophage activation, and this effect
could be blocked with an inhibitor of protein kinase c.
the release of  xxxg1144xxx  protein from activated cells is rapid
and resistant to protein synthesis inhibition, suggesting
that the released protein comes from a substantial preformed pool of molecules in macrophages (nagaoka et
al., 1990). il-4 and il-13 induce  xxxg1144xxx  production in
mouse macrophages through the enhancement of gene
transcription (wynes and riches, 2003). moreover, interferon ␥ could block the actions of these th2 cytokines.
 xxxg2217xxx  mediated the actions of il-4 and il-13, whereas
stat1 was necessary for the attenuating effects exerted
by interferon ␥ (wynes and riches, 2003). in a growth
factor withdrawal model of lung fibrosis, il-4-induced
macrophage-derived  xxxg1144xxx  protects ccl39 myofibroblasts from apoptosis, an action attenuated with  xxxg1144xxx -specific neutralizing antibodies (wynes et al., 2004).
macrophages and monocytes express receptors for advanced glycosylation end-products. when these receptors become activated,  xxxg1144xxx  mrna is up-regulated in
monocytes and  xxxg1144xxx  protein is released (kirstein et
al., 1992). levels of  xxxg1144xxx  mrna and  xxxg1149xxx  increased in a time-dependent manner in cultured bone
marrow-derived murine macrophages subjected to
 xxxd1696xxx -1. these experimental conditions promote cell proliferation and differentiation (long et al., 1998). those studies suggested that  xxxg1149xxx  might exert a modulating effect
on  xxxg1144xxx -dependent macrophage differentiation and
proliferation.
d. neutrophils and other granulocytes
other members of the immune system also seem to
share important relationships with  xxxg1144xxx  and its signaling pathway. notable among these are neutrophils,
which serve as important effector cells in innate immunity. they function as an early defense against microorganisms. neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptosis, a
process that seems to be slowed by  xxxg1144xxx  (kooijman et
al., 2002). in a later study, these same investigators demonstrated that  xxxg1144xxx  can block fas-mediated apoptosis (himpe
et al., 2008). the pro-survival effects of the growth factor
are mediated through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
pathway. moreover, the presence of cytokines failed to
alter the antiapoptotic actions of  xxxg1144xxx , suggesting that
they may play a dominant role, even within the context
of active inflammation. in contrast,  xxxg1144xxx  seems to attenuate the impact of stress on mouse gastric mucosal
injury by inhibiting neutrophil activation (zhao et al.,
2009).  xxxg1144xxx  mrna is developmentally regulated in
mononuclear phagocytic cells (arkins et al., 1993,
1995a,b,c).

v. implications of insulin-like growth factor-i
and insulin-like growth factor-i receptor in
immune modulation
what does the realization that a growth factor pathway can influence immune function teach us about integrative human biology? why should molecules playing
dominant roles in the regulation of metabolism, growth,
and development also influence the function of the immune system? what advantage to the organism does
such integration provide with respect to the overall energetic economy, survival, and host defense? is nature
“double-dipping” and using a well traveled set of signaling pathways for multiple unrelated purposes? or does
the logic emerging from a better understanding of evolution help us to identify the pressures that are driving
such an overlap?
great wisdom may be found in this sharing of common
pathways. first, growth factors have now been implicated in normal and pathological wound healing and in
tissue remodeling under a variety of clinical circumstances. the ir and its downstream signaling targets,
including akt, are now thought to regulate the metabolic
activity of t cells (frauwirth and thompson, 2004). insulin itself has been shown to exhibit a set of chemoattractant properties (berman and center, 1987). phytohemagglutinin-activated human t cells are 100-fold
more responsive to porcine insulin than are resting lymphocytes. moreover, both cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ cells behave
identically when treated with insulin (berman and center, 1987).  xxxg1743xxx  kinase mediates many of the actions of
t-cell costimulatory molecules including cd28. activation of cd28, with tcr, can coordinately up-regulate
glucose availability and metabolism and can therefore
accommodate the increased energetic needs associated
with cell activation. a specific role for the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway
in influencing metabolic activity in lymphocytes has yet
to be explored, but its similarities to that of insulin
suggest that both may modulate energy turnover in
immune responses.
taken in aggregate, these studies tell us that substantial cross-talk occurs between a complex array of pathways that have proven integral to energy turnover,
growth, and development. these pathways, however,
seem to determine, at least in part, the amplitude and
quality of immune responses. a thread common to these
biological functions relates to the high energetic costs of
each. it seems logical and even likely, therefore, that a
selection advantage underlies the coordination between
these aspects of survival. however, because these components are overlapping, interrupting any one of them
might have untoward consequences and thus might
limit therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.
therein lies the particular attraction associated with
the therapeutic targeting of receptors such as  xxxg1145xxx .
these lie upstream from the intermediate signaling kinases that participate in multiple signaling pathways.

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

vi. insulin-like growth factor-i, insulin-like
growth factor-i receptor, and autoimmunity
the constellation of autoimmune diseases continues
to represent a particularly vexing group of maladies that
are tied together by common etiologic features with uncertain identities. they are thought to emerge from both
genetic and environmental factors. genetic predisposition to autoimmunity was demonstrated nearly 40 years
ago by vladutiu and rose (1971). there is reason to
suspect that shared susceptibility genes participate in
many, because they cluster in families. moreover, patients often manifest multiple diseases. most but not all
exhibit strong female gender predilection (fairweather
et al., 2008). moreover, the general features of autoimmunity occurring in men and women differ. at the center of these diseases are many of the same pathological
features associated with other chronic processes in
which inflammation gives way to tissue remodeling. the
findings to date concerning the putative role of  xxxg1144xxx /
 xxxg1145xxx  in regulating immune function have begun to
suggest its potential involvement in autoimmunity. specifically,  xxxg1144xxx  influences the physiological behavior
of lymphocytes and other professional immune cells
through its activation of  xxxg1145xxx . responses to growth
factors and the display of their receptors at relatively
high levels could underlie the participation of these cells
in chronic inflammatory disease. t cell activation seems
to be coupled to increased  xxxg1144xxx  responses (berman and
center, 1987). thus, a potential involvement of the
 xxxg1144xxx  pathway might help explain several aspects of
human autoimmunity. these lines of evidence will be
reviewed.
a. systemic inflammation
several potential connections have been made recently between the loss of tolerance to self-antigens and
the actions of  xxxg1144xxx . of particular interest is the potential for  xxxg1144xxx  to influence the functions and regulation of
inflammatory effector cells, particularly professional
phagocytes. for instance, cathelicidin  xxxg332xxx / xxxg332xxx ,
an antimicrobial peptide involved in innate immunity,
can be detected in alveolar macrophages, neutrophils,
and macrophages after infection with mycobacterium
tuberculosis (drop et al., 1992). it is constitutively expressed or can be induced in these cells through toll-like
receptors 9, 4, and 2 (rivas-santiago et al., 2008).  xxxd1773xxx 
complexes with dna and rna and, in doing so, elicits
immune responses to microbial nucleic acids. cathelicidin  xxxg332xxx / xxxg332xxx  is also expressed by a549 epithelial
cells and, in this context, has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of psoriasis (lande et al., 2007) through a
mechanism involving plasmacytoid dendritic cells becoming activated to host dna. human keratinocytes
express  xxxd1773xxx  as well as human ␤-defensin 3, neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and secretory leukocyte
protease inhibitor in response to  xxxg1144xxx  and tgf-␣ (sø-

213

rensen et al., 2003). is it thus possible that the upregulation of  xxxd1773xxx  by  xxxg1144xxx  and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine, tgf2␣, elicits autoimmune responses through
inappropriate reactivity to host dna or rna? could
these insights provide important clues regarding  xxxg1144xxx 
activation of innate immunity during tissue injury?
 xxxd1773xxx  might also possess inhibitory activity against proteases, potentially resulting in a breakdown of immune
tolerance.
b. graves’ disease
graves’ disease has recently been examined as potentially involving the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway. it represents
an autoimmune syndrome with multiple components,
the most frequent of which involves thyroid gland overactivity and enlargement (davies, 1996). in addition, the
tissues surrounding the eye, called the orbit, become
activated in a substantial fraction of patients with
graves’ disease in a process known as thyroid-associated
ophthalmopathy (tao). the activation of orbital fibroblasts seems to be at the center of tao pathogenesis.
these cells have a phenotype distinct from fibroblasts
inhabiting other connective tissues (smith et al., 1995,
2002).
graves’ disease is a prototypic example of antibodydriven autoimmunity. central to promoting the hyperthyroid state and thyroid enlargement in this disease
are activating antibodies directed against the thyroidstimulating  xxxg1603xxx  ( xxxg2341xxx  or
 xxxg2341xxx ) (zakarija et al., 1988). these antibodies, termed
thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, override the trophic control of thyroid function normally imposed by the
hypothalamic/anterior pituitary axis through its elaboration by thyrotrophs of tsh. tsh ordinarily acts as the
dominant regulator of the biosynthetic activities of thyroid epithelial cells. this axis is regulated by a sensitive
feedback loop that responds to the circulating levels of
the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
adequate levels of these hormones turn off the production and release of tsh in states of thyroid hormone
sufficiency.  xxxg2341xxx  represents a seven membrane-spanning g protein-coupled receptor (parmentier et al.,
1989). its expression was originally thought to be limited to the thyroid epithelium. more recently, it has been
found to be displayed on fat cells in several connective
tissue depots, and unexpectedly by  xxxg1206xxx ⫺ bone marrow cells in mice (bell et al., 2000; wang and klein,
2001; klein, 2003). of potential importance to the pathogenesis of tao is the demonstration of  xxxg2341xxx  mrna in
orbital tissues (feliciello et al., 1993) and by orbital
fibroblasts (heufelder et al., 1993).
an intriguing relationship between thyroid function
and  xxxg1144xxx  was first recognized more than 20 years ago,
when the rat clonal thyroid epithelial cell line frtl-5
was found to exhibit far greater responses to tsh in the
presence of either insulin or  xxxg1144xxx  in the culture medium (tramontano et al., 1986, 1987, 1988a,b). ingbar et

214

smith

al. found that both  xxxg1144xxx  and tsh could enhance
frtl-5 cell proliferation and dna synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner and that the actions of
these agents were synergistic (tramontano et al., 1986).
in contrast,  xxxg1144xxx  does not influence tsh-dependent
camp generation in these frtl-5 cells (tramontano et
al., 1986, 1987, 1988a,b). when  xxxg1144xxx  is replaced by
insulin, equivalent effects are seen. both insulin and
 xxxg1144xxx  down-regulate major histocompatibility complex
class i gene expression (giuliani et al., 2006). these
growth factors depress the activity of the intact  xxxg1688xxx 
gene promoter but up-regulate those of mutant promoter
constructs lacking the tissue-specific region but retaining a gene enhancer sequence. moreover,  xxxg1144xxx  and insulin facilitate the interactions between promoter regions with transcription factors, including activator
protein-1 and nuclear factor-␬b (giuliani et al., 2006).
clément et al. (2001) demonstrated that the conditional
overexpression of both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  in the thyroids
of double-transgenic mice increases thyroid gland
weight and follicular lumen volumes in vivo. a number
of reports have suggested that substantial overlap exists
between the signaling elicited by tsh and  xxxg1144xxx  in
thyroid epithelium. specifically, several signaling events
downstream from  xxxg2341xxx  are mediated through the  xxxg1743xxx 
kinase pathway and involve activation of the akt/frap/
mtor/p70s6k pathway (cass and meinkoth, 1998; park
et al., 2000a,b, 2005). this pathway mediates a number
of the growth-promoting actions of  xxxg1144xxx  in many responsive cell types. in addition, it regulates the translation of proteins encoded for by preformed mrnas containing an oligopyrimidine tract at the transcriptional
start site (jefferies et al., 1997).
it has been proposed that  xxxg1145xxx  and  xxxg2341xxx  might
participate together in the pathogenesis of graves’ disease through their physical and functional interactions.
activation of each receptor results in the utilization of
common downstream signaling pathways. specifically,
 xxxg2341xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  seem to act in concert to regulate
discrete metabolic activities within the thyroid, including cellular proliferation and apoptosis. recently, a report suggested that  xxxg2341xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  colocalize in orbital fibroblasts and in human thyroid epithelial cells in
culture (tsui et al., 2008). moreover, these investigators
found that both  xxxg1145xxx ␤ and  xxxg2341xxx  could be pulled
down by antibodies specific for either protein. it is noteworthy that that report also suggested that interrupting
 xxxg1145xxx  signaling by incubating cells with a blocking
monoclonal antibody directed against  xxxg1145xxx ␣ (1h7)
could attenuate the activation of erk provoked by tsh
(tsui et al., 2008). those findings imply a functional
complex comprising  xxxg2341xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx  and that  xxxg1145xxx 
transactivation could mediate at least some aspects of
 xxxg2341xxx  signaling. whether this relationship between the
two receptors in any way relates to the pathogenesis of
graves’ disease remains uncertain.

activation of the orbital connective tissue in tao is
characterized by often intense inflammatory responses
involving t-, b-, and mast-cell infiltration of orbital tissues and their dramatic remodeling (prabhakar et al.,
2003). although the antibodies generated against the
 xxxg2341xxx  help explain the aberrant growth of thyroid tissue
and its overproduction of thyroid hormone, any role for
that receptor and the activating antibodies generated
against it in tao remains incompletely understood.
reconciling the tissue reactivity in the orbit with the
thyroid pathology on the basis of a one-antigen/one antibody paradigm has been difficult to accomplish. other
antigens besides  xxxg2341xxx  have been examined for their
potential involvement in tao. among them, the  xxxg1144xxx 
pathway was first implicated in studies examining
whether igg from patients with graves’ disease (gdigg) could displace 125i- xxxg1144xxx  from the surface of human
fibroblasts (weightman et al., 1993). those studies demonstrated a dose-dependent competition with radiolabeled  xxxg1144xxx  from fibroblast surfaces. although this
study was incomplete in that it neglected to explore the
identity of the binding site(s), it broke new ground in
implicating the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway in graves’ disease. the
study also fell short of characterizing whether gd-igg
could either block occupancy or activate the receptor.
the basis for loss of peripheral immune tolerance to
 xxxg1145xxx  underlying the generation of the  xxxg1145xxx -activating antibodies in graves’ disease remains unknown.
more recently, a study has demonstrated increased
density of  xxxg1145xxx  on the surface of orbital fibroblasts
from patients with graves’ disease (pritchard et al.,
2003). in addition, the frequency of fibroblasts expressing the receptor protein is also elevated above that found
in control cultures derived from healthy tissue. the levels of  xxxg1145xxx  are approximately 3- to 4-fold higher than
those found in control fibroblasts. moreover, gd-iggs
could activate fibroblasts from patients with graves’
disease from several connective tissue depots (pritchard
et al., 2003). these include orbital fat, neck skin, abdominal skin, and pretibium. when treated with gd-igg or
with  xxxg1144xxx , these fibroblasts expressed two powerful
t-cell chemoattractants, namely il-16 and  xxxg363xxx 
(pritchard et al., 2002). il-16 specifically targets cd4⫹bearing t cells and therefore serves as a chemoattractant for only one subset of lymphocytes (klimiuk et al.,
1999). it is expressed by both cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ lymphocytes, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and mast cells (center
et al., 1997, sciaky et al., 2000). the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of il-16 and regulation of its
expression vary among these cell types. in fibroblasts,
relatively high levels of untranslated il-16 mrna can
be detected under basal culture conditions. cell activation with  xxxg1144xxx  leads to the caspase-3-dependent production of il-16 protein (zhang et al., 1998).  xxxg363xxx , a
c-c chemokine, is also expressed by several cell types
and exerts its biological actions through multiple g protein-coupled receptors, including ccr4 and ccr5

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

(schall et al., 1990).  xxxg363xxx  targets several subpopulations of lymphocytes. both il-16 and  xxxg363xxx  have
been implicated previously in other autoimmune diseases (klimiuk et al., 1999; simchen et al., 2000) and
elevated levels of both have been detected in the general
circulation of patients with chronic inflammatory disease (blaschke et al., 2001; christodoulakos et al., 2007).
the induction of il-16 by  xxxg1144xxx  in fibroblasts from
patients with graves’ disease involves the activation of
the akt/mtor/frap/p70s6k pathway and can be attenuated with rapamycin, a macrolide exhibiting both antifungal and immunosuppressive activities (pritchard et
al., 2002). rapamycin specifically targets mtor, one of
the terminal kinases coupling mitogenic stimulation to
the serine/threonine phosphorylation of the eukaryotic
initiation factor (eif)-4e-binding protein,  xxxg693xxx  (pritchard et al., 2002). physiological concentrations of glucocorticoids also block the induction by  xxxg1144xxx  of il-16
and  xxxg363xxx  (pritchard et al., 2002). in contrast, the
induction of  xxxg363xxx  seems unaffected by rapamycin
and, unlike that of il-16, involves  xxxg1144xxx  actions mediated at the pretranslational level (pritchard et al., 2002).
the mechanism for  xxxg1144xxx  and gd-igg induction of these
chemoattractants remains incompletely described. the
antibody(s) was found to bind to  xxxg1145xxx  (pritchard et al.,
2003). an  xxxg1145xxx  blocking monoclonal antibody, 1h7,
completely abrogates the signaling and induction of
il-16 and  xxxg363xxx -dependent t-cell migration activity
generated by fibroblasts treated with either  xxxg1144xxx  or
gd-igg (fig. 4) (pritchard et al., 2003). moreover, transfection of tao orbital fibroblasts with a mutant dominant-negative  xxxg1145xxx , designated 486 stop (reiss et
al., 2001), could also block il-16 and  xxxg363xxx  synthesis
resulting from the actions of  xxxg1144xxx  and gd-igg (fig. 5).
subsequently, gd-igg and  xxxg1144xxx  were found to also
induce the synthesis of hyaluronan in orbital fibroblasts
from donors with tao (smith and hoa, 2004). it is
noteworthy that control orbital fibroblasts from persons
without autoimmune diseases failed to respond to either
 xxxg1144xxx  or gd-igg (pritchard et al., 2002, 2003; smith and
hoa, 2004). this same pattern of il-16 and  xxxg363xxx 
induction by  xxxg1144xxx  was subsequently described in cultured primary human thyroid epithelial cells (gianoukakis et al., 2006). unlike control fibroblasts, thyrocytes from donors without graves’ disease or other
autoimmune thyroid processes also responded to  xxxg1144xxx 
and gd-igg. what has emerged from these studies conducted in cultured fibroblasts and thyrocytes is the concept that  xxxg1145xxx  might play a critical role in activating
t-cell trafficking signals in infiltrated tissues.
finding more numerous  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ fibroblasts with increased receptor density raised questions concerning
whether other cell types might also overexpress the protein. moreover, this abnormal pattern of expression
could help explain loss of peripheral immune tolerance
to  xxxg1145xxx . examination of circulating t cells from patients with graves’ disease has disclosed an over-abun-

al., 2007). in some patients, more than 95% of
cd8⫹cd45ro⫹ t cells display  xxxg1145xxx . unlike taoderived orbital fibroblasts, in which cell-surface  xxxg1145xxx 
densities are 3- to 4-fold higher than those on control
cells, receptor levels on t cells from patients with
graves’ disease are similar to those found on control
lymphocytes (douglas et al., 2007). as with fibroblasts,
t cells bearing the  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ phenotype exhibit preferential resistance to apoptosis and a growth advantage in
vitro. orbital t cells from those patients manifesting
severe tao also exhibit the skewed phenotype. studies
examining the phenotype of peripheral and orbital b
cells from these patients suggest that they too are

skewed toward the  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ phenotype. of the b cells
from donors with graves’ disease (n ⫽ 30), 34 ⫾ 4%
(mean ⫾ s.e.) display  xxxg1145xxx , whereas the receptor was
detected on 9 ⫾ 3% of b cells from 24 control donors (fig. 8)
(douglas et al., 2008). analogous to t cells, the phenotype of b cells with the  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ skew also seems durable in patients observed over many months. moreover, it
seems to remain, even in those whose diagnosis was
made years before their participation in the study.  xxxg1144xxx 
treatment promotes b cell survival in vitro and seems to
act synergistically with cpg to enhance total igg production (fig. 9). ebv-transformed  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ b cells consistently produced anti- xxxg2341xxx  antibodies, suggesting
that the skew toward receptor expression might underlie autoantibody production. future examination of
other phenotypic attributes displayed by  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ b cell
subsets might prove enlightening. these include determining the impact of  xxxg1145xxx  display and activation on
antigen presentation, cytokine production, and t-celldependent b-cell activation.
both genetic and acquired factors are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of graves’ disease (brix et
al., 1998). much investigation has focused on the identification of a gene locus or multiple loci that could help
explain susceptibility to the disease. a number of candidates have been found (ban and tomer, 2005). nevertheless, no single gene seems likely to explain the pattern of inheritance of graves’ disease in large cohorts of
patients and their families. indeed, substantial evidence
supports the importance of acquired factors in disease
development layered on to as yet unidentified genetic
determinants (prummel et al., 2004). these conclusions
rest on data from population-based twin studies, especially those using the danish twin cohort. examination
of monozygotic twins discordant for graves’ disease suggests that 70% of the cause of the disorder comes from
environmental aspects of disease acquisition (brix et al.,
1998). douglas et al. (2009) found that the majority of
clinically healthy, unaffected monozygotic twins in discordant pairs failed to exhibit an  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ skewed population of circulating t and b cells compared with their
twin with graves’ disease. the study replicated observations made earlier by the same authors in a separate
north american cohort of patients with sporadic graves’
disease (douglas et al., 2007, 2008). it is noteworthy
that this recent study demonstrates that the more frequent display of  xxxg1145xxx  on t and b cells, associated with
graves’ disease, seems to derive from acquired rather
than genetic factors. thus, for the first time in the context of graves’ disease, a discrete cellular attribute
might be ascribed to acquired factors. whether the skew
toward  xxxg1145xxx ⫹ phenotype in b and t cells might be
shared with other chronic autoimmune diseases or is
specific to graves’ disease remains to be determined.
these findings identify  xxxg1145xxx  as a potentially attractive target for interrupting early disease-related processes. that strategy would have the goal of preventing

local trafficking of lymphocyte subsets responsible for
driving tissue reactivity and remodeling. such an approach could be based on the use of antibodies that block
receptor binding or small molecules that interfere specifically with  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation or its interaction
with relevant docking proteins. whatever treatment approach proves most rewarding,  xxxg1145xxx  has emerged as a
potentially important therapeutic target for attenuating
connective tissue activation in graves’ disease. this is
especially true of those disease manifestations that remain ineffectively treated, such as tao. early experiences with the anti- xxxg1145xxx  blocking antibodies currently being examined for treating various forms of cancer
suggest that many of these might prove well tolerated. the
absence of complete and robust preclinical models of
graves’ disease (baker et al., 2005) in which to test the
efficacy of this approach imposes a considerable obstacle to
efficiently identifying new therapies.

c. other autoimmune diseases
a number of autoimmune diseases have been superficially examined for their potential association with
abnormalities in the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway. a substantial link between this pathway and the pathogenesis of
these diseases has yet to be established. however, a
limited body of information thus far generated suggests
that  xxxg1144xxx , its receptors, and its binding proteins might
ultimately prove relevant to the mechanistic underpinnings of several allied diseases. the insights recently generated concerning the involvement of  xxxg1145xxx  in graves’
disease would seem to make similar efforts in these other
autoimmune processes potentially rewarding.

autoimmune diseases, type 1 dm represents a convergence of multiple genetic and environmental factors

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

regard to the insulin and  xxxg1144xxx  signaling pathways as
regulators of immune function and dysfunction. xuan et
al. (2002) reported that tissue-specific, conditional mutagenesis of  xxxg1145xxx , resulting in its silence, failed to
alter ␤ cell mass. on the other hand, ablation of  xxxg1145xxx 
signaling resulted in an age-dependent decline in glucose and arginine-dependent insulin release, underscoring the importance of this receptor in normal pancreatic
function. therefore, carbohydrate intolerance might result from altered function of the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway. in the
goto-kakizaki rat model of type ii dm, defective  xxxg1146xxx 
and  xxxg1145xxx  expression in the embryonic pancreas results in diminished ␤-cell mass and precedes hyperglycemia (calderari et al., 2007). insulin itself exhibits
substantial chemotactic activity to t cells (berman and
center, 1987). in phytohemagglutinin-activated t cells,
the chemotactic response to insulin was enhanced compared with that exhibited by resting lymphocytes. moreover, cd4⫹ and cd8⫹ cells responded identically. the
kinetics suggested that high-affinity ir was mediating
this response (berman and center, 1987). t cells express
and display ir after activation and treatment with insulin enhances intermediary metabolism (krug et al.,
1972; helderman and strom, 1977), progression through
the cell cycle (snow et al., 1980; helderman, 1981;
kumagai et al., 1981), and an up-regulated effector function (brown et al., 1983). thus, it is entirely possible

219

that elevated serum insulin levels, resulting from states
of insulin resistance such as those found in type ii dm,
might result in a substantial and direct impact on t
cells. this is true of lymphocytes in the circulation as
well as those infiltrating the pancreas.
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  play integral roles in the development and function of ␤-islet cells, which produce both
proteins and respond to them through  xxxg1145xxx  (van
schravendijk et al., 1987; zhang et al., 1997).  xxxg1144xxx 
promotes islet growth, an action mediated by  xxxg1198xxx 
(bonner-weir and smith, 1994). conditional knockout of
 xxxg1145xxx  in ␤ cells results in elevated blood insulin levels
and glucose intolerance but fails to influence ␤-cell development or mass (kulkarni et al., 2002). in contrast,
global interruption of  xxxg1145xxx , such as that found in
 xxxg1145xxx (⫺/⫺) mice, results in reduced ␤-cell mass (withers
et al., 1999).  xxxg1144xxx  can protect against diabetes in a
nod mouse model, where autoreactive t cells were
adoptively transferred and donors treated with either
saline or the growth factor (bergerot et al., 1995).  xxxg1144xxx 
reduced the incidence of diabetes, abrogated insulitis,
and increased the abundance of intact islets. transgenic
mice, the ␤-islet cells of which overexpress  xxxg1144xxx , exhibit
enhanced recovery from cytotoxicity after treatments
with  xxxd3249xxx  (fig. 10) (george et al., 2002). the

genic animals was abrogated in double-transgenic animals harboring ␤ cells overexpressing both  xxxg1144xxx  and
interferon ␤ (casellas et al., 2006). moreover, the susceptibility of the single transgenic animals to  xxxd3249xxx -induced diabetes was markedly reduced. administration of  xxxg1144xxx , either as a free molecule or complexed
with igfbp3, reduced the severity and delayed the onset of diabetes in nod mice (chen et al., 2004). this
protective effect is mediated by increased ccl4 production and dampened  xxxg361xxx  expression. within the ␤ cell,
 xxxg1144xxx  activates akt signaling, resulting in enhanced
proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. human ␤ cells
transfected with the  xxxg1144xxx  gene also exhibit resistance
to apoptosis induced by il-1␤ (giannoukakis et al.,
2000).
because of its antiapoptotic effects on ␤ islet cells, and
its promotion of insulin secretion (kido et al., 2002;
xuan et al., 2002),  xxxg1144xxx  has been proposed as a potential therapy for dm, especially when associated with
insulin resistance (murphy, 2006). its administration
has been shown to result in enhanced insulin sensitivity
and improved glycemic control in both type i and ii dm
(clemmons et al., 2000, 2005). pennisi et al. (2006),
using mkr mice in which defective  xxxg1145xxx  dimerizes
with endogenous  xxxg1145xxx  and ir (le roith et al., 2002),
have reported that administration of  xxxg1144xxx  results in
reduced glucose levels. this effect can be attributed to
reduced endogenous glucose production rather than enhanced whole-body insulin sensitivity. the findings of
this and similar studies have reinvigorated consideration of  xxxg1144xxx  and its analogs in the therapy of dm, a
strategy largely abandoned because of the potential side
effects associated with its administration.
2. crohn’s disease. inflammatory diseases affecting
the gut continue to plague society. the etiologies of the
two principal forms, ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease, remain enigmatic, as does the pathogenic relationship between the two. both are believed to represent an
overdetermined immune reactivity to commensal bacteria in persons with a susceptibility to chronic inflammatory diseases (xavier and podolsky, 2007). the exact
nature of susceptibility to either process remains uncertain but many inciting factors seem to be shared by the
two diseases (cho, 2008). ulcerative colitis and crohn’s
disease present with distinctly different patterns of tissue involvement, affect different segments of the gut,
and seem to be based on divergent genetic abnormalities. they share genetic variations in the  xxxd3038xxx  receptor,
stat3, nkx2–3, and  xxxg1164xxx  genes (fisher et al., 2008;
franke et al., 2008). the immunological underpinnings
of crohn’s disease can be divided into those genetic
factors contributing to innate immunity and those involved in adaptive responses. with regard to the former,
gene polymorphisms of nod2, atg16l1, and irgm
appear to contribute to disease pathogenesis, as these
may play important roles in the processing of bacterialderived factors. participation of the gh/ xxxg1144xxx  pathway

in the pathogenesis of either crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis has yet to be firmly established, but important alterations in it have been well documented in
patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. gh
can dampen disease activity and enhance healing in
patients with crohn’s disease (slonim et al., 2000). the
 xxxg890xxx  has been detected in the gut of the rat
(lobie et al., 1990), and thus it may exert direct effects
on intestinal inflammation. han et al. (2005) reported
that gh reduces colitis activity in an experimental
model using c3h/hejbir il-10(⫺/⫺) mice, animals exhibiting a propensity for relatively severe forms of large
bowel inflammation. gh inhibits apoptosis and enhances the proliferation of crypt epithelial cells and increases mononuclear cell death in the lamina propria.
the mechanism underlying the effects of gh on disease
activity in this experimental model may involve an increased association between gp130 and  xxxg1894xxx  and
down-regulation of constitutively active stat3 (han et
al., 2005). the investigators involved in this study also
reported, using the same animal model, that blocking
the actions of tnf-␣ with a neutralizing antibody could
up-regulate hepatic  xxxg1144xxx  production and  xxxg890xxx 
expression and enhance gh-dependent  xxxg2216xxx  activation (difedele et al., 2005). in contrast, tnf-␣ reduced
the abundance of gh receptors and attenuated  xxxg2216xxx 
phosphorylation in cultured rat hepatocytes (difedele
et al., 2005). thus, it would seem that a complex interplay between pro-inflammatory cytokines and the gh/
 xxxg1144xxx  pathway might condition the inflammatory environment of the gut. moreover, these patterns of
molecular cross-talk seem to regulate gut responses to
mediators of chronic diseases in these experimental preclinical models. what these findings in animals and
cultured cells suggest about human disease remains to
be firmly established.
in a study examining 13 patients with crohn’s disease
and 7 subjects with ulcerative colitis,  xxxg1144xxx  mrna was
found to be elevated in involved ileum and colon segments from patients with crohn’s disease (pucilowska et
al., 2000). however, the same does not seem to be true
for involved colon tissue derived from patients with ulcerative colitis.  xxxg1144xxx  and procollagen ␣i mrnas exhibited overlapping distribution in fibrotic submucosa and
muscularis propria in crohn’s disease. moreover, the
numbers of  xxxg1144xxx -expressing mesenchymal cells types
was increased in involved regions of bowel in patients
with crohn’s disease (pucilowska et al., 2000). in another study, zimmermann et al. (2001) reported that
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1150xxx  mrna levels were increased in areas
of tissue affected by disease that had been resected from
patients with crohn’s disease compared with normalappearing bowel.
using immunohistochemistry, el yafi et al. (2005)
detected transmural expression of  xxxg1145xxx  in inflammatory cells and in smooth muscle cells identified in specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis, diverticuli-

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

tis, and crohn’s disease (fig. 11). infiltrating  xxxg1145xxx ⫹
mononuclear cells are far more numerous in the mucosa
and submucosa in crohn’s disease. in contrast, the increased frequency of these cells seems to be confined to
the mucosa in ulcerative colitis (fig. 12). in addition,
fibroblasts, adipocytes, and hypertrophic nervous plexi
displaying  xxxg1145xxx  seemed peculiar to crohn’s disease
(el yafi et al., 2005). these findings suggest that  xxxg1145xxx 
might play disease-specific roles in the pattern of tissue
reactivity and remodeling in inflammatory bowel
diseases.
children with crohn’s disease often exhibit depressed
systemic  xxxg1144xxx  levels. the factors underlying this finding remain uncertain. altered nutrition, such as reduced
caloric intake, is frequently encountered in patients
with active crohn’s disease and could account for the low
 xxxg1144xxx  levels (kirschner and sutton, 1986). twenty-nine
children with active disease were examined before and
after treatment with either systemic steroids or an elemental diet (thomas et al., 1993). median serum  xxxg1144xxx 
levels, as determined by radioimmunoassay, were lower
among this cohort with disease than those found in
matched healthy control subjects and lower than those

221

in children with growth-stunting from other causes. insulin and  xxxg1148xxx  levels were unaffected.  xxxg1144xxx  levels
increased after 4 weeks of either dietary intervention or
steroid therapy. in another study, children and adolescents with crohn’s disease were assigned to either of two
treatment groups (beattie et al., 1998). the first cohort
of 14 subjects received enteral nutrition, whereas the
second group of nine underwent surgical intestinal resection (beattie et al., 1998). in those patients treated
with diet modification, crp fell from pretreatment levels. median circulating total  xxxg1144xxx  levels, as determined
by a  xxxd2154xxx -acetone extraction and radioimmunoassay method, increased rapidly within 2 weeks of treatment
initiation, as did serum igfbp3 levels. similar trends
were observed in the subjects undergoing surgical resections. serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels increased, whereas crp concentrations trended downward, but these changes failed
to reach statistical significance after 6 months after
surgery (beattie et al., 1998). studies in adults have
demonstrated many of these same effects of bowel inflammation on the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway. in a series of 22
consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
10 were diagnosed with crohn’s disease, whereas 12 had

ulcerative colitis (katsanos et al., 2001). serum  xxxg1144xxx 
levels were similarly depressed in patients with either
disease compared with control subjects. igfbp3 levels
were also lower, whereas the mean serum il-6 concentration was elevated. in 13 patients with refractory crohn’s
disease, total  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp3 levels were depressed
by 36 and 27%, respectively, before therapy (eivindson
et al., 2007). both serum markers normalized during
treatment with infliximab. in contrast, free  xxxg1144xxx  levels,
determined using ultrafiltration, were reduced by 47%
pretreatment but failed to normalize. igfbp2 levels
were elevated at baseline by 2.3-fold over controls and
fell with therapy. other markers, such as crp and
 xxxg124xxx , also normalized as a consequence of
therapy (eivindson et al., 2007).
whether the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway and gh play primary roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease remains uncertain. although several lines of
investigation have identified specific abnormalities in
these pathways, especially in crohn’s disease, alterations in many other laboratory-based parameters have
also been demonstrated. some of these are most likely a
secondary consequence of the often-severe malnutrition
resulting from bowel disfunction. distinguishing these
nonspecific effects from those metabolic and immunologic derangements underlying disease pathogenesis
will require further investigation.
3. rheumatoid arthritis and allied connective tissue
diseases.  xxxg1144xxx  plays an important role in the regulation of articular connective tissues under normal
physiological conditions as well as those associated
with disease (verschure et al., 1996). a hallmark of

rheumatoid arthritis (ra), the progressive formation
and growth of abnormal tissues, such as panus, suggests that growth factor production and/or activity
might play some role in the disease process. indeed,
 xxxg1144xxx  can be detected in synovial fluid from patients
with active ra but at levels that do not differ from
those found in healthy donors (matsumoto et al.,
1996). using in situ hybridization, keyszer et al.
(1995) detected transcripts encoding  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx 
in synovial tissues, both from patients with ra and
from those with osteoarthritis. the greatest signal
intensity was localized to the synovial lining and subsynovial layer. inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates
rarely stained with probes for either growth factor
(keyszer et al., 1995).  xxxg1144xxx  present in synovial fluid
may regulate the synthesis of proteoglycans in chondrocytes (schalkwijk et al., 1989). neidel et al. (1997)
reported elevated levels of serum and synovial fluid igfbp-2
and igfbp-3 in patients with ra compared with those
found in patients with osteoarthritis. they also found
equivalent levels of  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  in synovial fluid
from control subjects and patients with ra. these stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage in vitro, activity that could be partially blocked with anti- xxxg1144xxx 
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (neidel et al., 1997).
fernihough et al. (1996), on the other hand, reported
elevated  xxxg1144xxx  and igfbp3 levels both in patients with
ra and in those with osteoarthritis. moreover, they
found that crp levels in patients with ra correlated
with those of  xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxg1146xxx , and igfbp-3 in the synovial
fluid. matsumoto et al. (1996) reported that  xxxg1144xxx  levels
as well as those of  xxxg1148xxx , igfbp-2, igfbp-3, and

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

 xxxg1149xxx  were elevated in synovial fluid in patients with
ra. this same group of investigators reported that serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels were lower in ra, whereas serum
igfbp-3 levels exceeded those found in control subjects
(matsumoto and tsurumoto, 2002). pritchard et al.
(2004) found that either  xxxg1144xxx  or iggs collected from
patients with active ra could activate disease-derived
synovial fibroblasts to produce il-16 and  xxxg363xxx . both
cytokines exhibited biological activity promoting chemotaxis in cd4⫹ t cells in vitro. in contrast, fibroblasts
from patients with osteoarthritis, serving as controls,
failed to respond to either the disease-derived iggs or to
 xxxg1144xxx . it is noteworthy that the effects in ra fibroblasts
were mediated through  xxxg1145xxx  and could also be elicited
by gd-igg from patients with graves’ disease (fig. 13).
moreover, iggs from these patients with ra could reciprocally induce il-16 and  xxxg363xxx  in fibroblasts from
donors with graves’ disease (pritchard et al., 2004).
these findings imply that a common disease mechanism
might underlie t-cell trafficking in multiple autoimmune disorders, such as graves’ disease and ra. moreover, the incidence of these diseases is known to cluster
in certain families and to cosegregate with greater frequency in susceptible persons. their findings imply disease specificity in that donors with osteoarthritis, who
manifest a chronic inflammatory disease albeit of a nonautoimmune nature, fail to respond to either  xxxg1144xxx  or
disease-derived igg. it is thus possible that the break-

down of peripheral tolerance to  xxxg1145xxx  results from its
overexpression in populations at risk for autoimmune
disease.
systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is associated
with abnormalities of both t- and b-cell function (kammer et al., 2002; khan et al., 2003). a hallmark of the
disorder is the generation of anti-nuclear antibodies
(tan, 1996). widespread vascular inflammation in
sle is layered on to organ-specific manifestations and
the deposition of immune complexes. little is currently known about any role that the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx 
pathway might play in the pathogenesis of sle. a
single study examining the circulating levels of
 xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx ,  xxxg1144xxx , and somatostatin in agematched controls and patients with sle failed to demonstrate any differences (denko and malemud, 2004).
although this single report was quite preliminary, its
results suggest that abnormally high levels of circulating  xxxg1144xxx  might not be associated with the disease.
systemic sclerosis represents another vexing
chronic process. interstitial lung disease frequently
accompanies systemic sclerosis, but the mechanisms
through which pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis
occur remain uncertain (harrison et al., 1991). although the conventional view embraces inflammation
as a precursor of fibroproliferation, recent studies
have cast some doubt on the inevitability of that relationship (krein and winston, 2002). most studies
have insinuated tgf-␤ and  xxxg1144xxx  as promoters of
fibroblast proliferation and the disordered accumulation of extracellular matrix (krein and winston,
2002). excess collagen is deposited in lung interstitium as a common feature of tissue remodeling. harrison et al. (1994) have reported that bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid from these patients enhances fibroblast
proliferation in vitro and that neutralizing antibodies
directed against  xxxg1144xxx  can attenuate this effect. moreover, elevated  xxxg1144xxx  levels were found in this fluid
compared with samples from control donors. the findings diverge from an earlier study by rothe et al.
(1988) who reported normal plasma  xxxg1144xxx 
levels in patients with active disease. reconciling the
findings of the two studies suggests that  xxxg1144xxx  may
act locally rather than systemically in the disease.
harrison et al. (1994) found that  xxxg1144xxx  levels were
elevated only in those patients having abnormal computed tomographic analysis, which was consistent
with the disease. fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis have been shown to respond to growth
factors and to produce excessively high levels of glycosaminoglycans (leroy et al., 1982; falanga et al.,
1987). idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated
with epithelial cell damage and fibroblast proliferation (medsger, 1985). in 15 patients with cutaneous
disease (morphea), punch biopsies from within lesions
were compared with those from normal-appearing
skin (fawzi et al., 2008). intralesional  xxxg1144xxx  levels

were higher than those found in uninvolved skin.
moreover, these patients exhibited elevated serum
 xxxg1144xxx  levels. positive correlations were observed between the intralesional  xxxg1144xxx  levels and rodnan
scores (fawzi et al., 2008). the authors concluded that
 xxxg1144xxx  antagonists, such as octreotide, deserve consideration as therapeutic strategies. the molecular basis
for involvement of  xxxg1144xxx  or  xxxg1145xxx  in systemic sclerosis has yet to be explored, but the particularly unsatisfactory clinical course associated with the disease
suggests that further examination is warranted.
4. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  xxxg1144xxx 
plays an important developmental role in the central
nervous system and is synthesized by multiple cell
types, including neurons and astrocytes (bondy, 1991;
lee et al., 1992). moreover,  xxxg1144xxx  induces oligodendrocyte development (mcmorris et al., 1986). experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) can be induced by
immunizing lewis rats with an emulsion containing
guinea pig spinal cord. this animal model resembles
that of human multiple sclerosis (raine, 1984). in rats
induced to express eae, mrnas encoding  xxxg1144xxx  and
 xxxg883xxx  were elevated 14 days after
disease induction (liu et al., 1994). moreover, expression of these transcripts coincided with the appearance
of inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination of both
white and gray matter (liu et al., 1994). in contrast,
levels of  xxxg1383xxx  mrna were reduced substantially. experimental animals expressed transiently
elevated levels of igfbp2 mrna and protein compared
with control animals (liu et al., 1994). moreover, coexpression of  xxxg1144xxx  and igfpb2 mrna was found by in
situ hybridization to localize to the same astrocytes. on

the other hand, animals treated with exogenous  xxxg1144xxx 
(200 ␮g/day or 1 mg/day) exhibited reduced demyelination, whereas myelin-related protein mrna levels were
induced in oligodendroglial cells (yao et al., 1995).
larger areas of demyelination were found in spinal cord
sections from placebo-treated animals, in addition to
substantially more inflammation, and a greater abundance of demyelinated axons compared with those from
animals treated with  xxxg1144xxx  (fig. 14) (yao et al., 1995).
the authors of that study concluded that  xxxg1144xxx  promotes
myelination and increases the proliferation of oligodendroglial cells. their results suggest further that the
 xxxg1144xxx  pathway might be manipulated as a strategy for
therapeutic intervention in multiple sclerosis and other
demyelinating disorders.
vii. therapeutic horizons for autoimmunity:
focusing on insulin-like growth factor-i and
insulin-like growth factor-i receptor
although not yet completely characterized, abnormalities in the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway associated with autoimmune diseases suggest that its therapeutic interruption might prove beneficial. this would resemble the
approach being undertaken in developing cancer therapy. despite these findings, none of the agents targeting
the pathway has been applied to patients with autoimmunity. common threads of  xxxg1144xxx  dysfunction seem to
tie multiple diseases together. one might therefore predict therapeutic benefit in those diseases where  xxxg1145xxx 
is found to be overexpressed, as is the case in graves’
disease, and particularly in those diseases in which receptor activation leads to abnormal responses in im-

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

mune cells. considering the numerous hurdles that
have already been overcome in developing these
agents for use in cancer, their application in autoimmunity might represent low-hanging fruit to the pharmaceutical industry.
what can we learn from the substantial efforts expended toward targeting the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway in
neoplastic diseases as we formulate new therapies for
autoimmune diseases? are there molecules currently on
the shelf that might be used in several of these diseases
in which adequate therapies do not exist? a brief review
of the strategies employed to treat cancers might orient
discussions surrounding similar targets in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as those with an autoimmune
basis. these strategies are nicely reviewed in a recently
published article by kim et al. (2009) focusing on pediatric tumors.
a number of membrane-spanning  xxxg2198xxx  receptors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several common neoplastic diseases. the fundamental concept of interrupting their function as an important
means of treating human illness emerged more than two
decades ago (rondon et al., 2007; frasca et al., 2008).
this notion has been fortified by a greater understanding of how growth factors exert their influence on target
tissues and relevant populations of cells. specifically,
these receptors and their downstream signaling cascades are involved in promoting enhanced resistance to
apoptosis and increased proliferation of cancer cells.
they have thus become rational targets for therapy design (shawver et al., 2002). among them,  xxxg682xxx , her2,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor, c-kit, colonystimulating factor-1 receptor, fibroblast growth factor
receptor, and  xxxg1145xxx  have been identified as therapeutic
targets of potential clinical importance. interest in
 xxxg1145xxx  as an antineoplastic target derives from the discovery that the receptor is overexpressed in many tumor
types and that its increased presence and activity may
constitute the antiapoptotic and proliferation enhancement associated with several cancers.
 xxxg1144xxx  pathway activation alters cancer cell behavior.
it has been implicated in tumor genesis, angiogenesis,
metastasis, and mitogenesis in preclinical disease models.  xxxg1145xxx  may undergo divergent post-translational
processing in neoplastic cells. in addition, some tumors
exhibit down-regulated levels of igf-iir, thereby reducing their capacity to decoy  xxxg1144xxx  and limiting their modulation of its actions (samani et al., 2007).  xxxg1145xxx  acts
as an oncogene when overexpressed (kaleko et al.,
1990). because it regulates cell proliferation by mediating
mitogenic signals, is necessary for maintaining transformed phenotypes, and protects against apoptosis (resnicoff and baserga, 1998), interfering with  xxxg1145xxx  expression/signaling constitutes a currently attractive
approach for drug design. altering the activity of the
 xxxg1144xxx  pathway has been proposed in several diseases,
including cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis (sachdev

225

et al., 2006, clemmons, 2007). it would seem that local
concentrations of  xxxg1144xxx  and relative levels of  xxxg1145xxx  and
igf-iir determine the activity of this pathway (butler
et al., 1998). thus, the stoichiometric relationship between these components and the igfbp family may
determine the net impact that  xxxg1144xxx  exerts on tumor
cells. local and circulating concentrations of  xxxg1144xxx  also
regulate aspects of tumor cell phenotype, including determining their aggressive behavior. for example, a
number of studies have suggested an increased risk of
prostate cancer in men with elevated plasma  xxxg1144xxx  levels (woodson et al., 2003; oliver et al., 2004).
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx , through their activities mediated
by  xxxg1145xxx , form important autocrine loops in cancer
that promote tumor survival advantage and proliferation. most of these effects are the consequence of
 xxxg1145xxx  autophosphorylation, the conformational
changes favoring its association with four irs docking
proteins, and the activation of map kinase and  xxxg1743xxx 
kinase pathways (samani et al., 2007). the progressive development of synthetic molecules that can alter
the biological impact of growth factors, their cognate
receptors, and the signaling cascades mediating their
actions now allows testing of the overarching hypothesis that clinical benefit accrues from pathway disruption. targeting the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway, either alone or in
aggregate with others, as a broadly based strategy,
seems to hold substantial promise for therapy of several forms of cancer. drug development targeting
 xxxg1145xxx  can be dissected into small molecule inhibitors
and monoclonal antibodies (imai and takaoka, 2006).
in addition, molecular strategies, such as the application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to  xxxg1145xxx  have
been shown to inactivate postreceptor signaling in
tumor cells (salatino et al., 2004).  xxxg1145xxx  gene silencing can be achieved using small interfering rna, rendering the target cells more susceptible to cytotoxic
agents and radiotherapy (salisbury and macaulay,
2003). the enormous advantage of targeting the receptor, rather than its downstream signaling, is the
ubiquitous involvement of the latter in critical nonpathological metabolic functions. initial enthusiasm
for  xxxg1145xxx -centric drugs was tempered by theoretical
concerns about the protein’s structural similarities to
ir and the potential for physiological promiscuity between the two receptors. subsequently, the successful
development of agents targeting receptors for the  xxxg681xxx  and vascular endothelial growth
factor has refocused the potential of  xxxg1145xxx  interruption. agents targeting  xxxg1145xxx  could emerge as attractive agents for treating autoimmune processes. however, given their generally less dire nature, using
these agents in autoimmunity places a greater burden
on demonstrating safety compared with their use in
malignancy.

viii. translational strategies for modulation of
insulin-like growth factor-i or insulin-like
growth factor-i receptor
a. strategies for generating insulin-like growth
factor-i receptor blocking antibodies
biological agents have become a major focus in novel
therapeutic development for cancer because of their potential for highly specific molecular and cellular targeting combined with their typically low toxicity compared
with small-molecule drugs. the rationale for using multiple agents directed at more than a single target stems
from efforts to minimize the emergence of drug resistance and to exploit the effectiveness of combined therapies. development of antibodies capable of altering the
signaling characteristics of  xxxg1145xxx  began more than 20
years ago, when the receptor’s potential importance in
cancer pathogenesis became clear. yamashita et al.
(1986) reported that the monoclonal antibody ␣ir3 could
block the effects of  xxxg1144xxx  on  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx  production
in human pituitary adenoma cells. subsequently, li et
al. (1993) described another monoclonal antibody, designated 1h7, that could block the ligation and activation
of  xxxg1145xxx . in the years that followed, a number of antiigf-ir antibodies have been developed. doern et al.
(2009) recently described an extensive panel of antibodies that can inhibit  xxxg1145xxx  activation and the downstream events associated with its signaling. they
screened and categorized these antibodies and divided
them into four groups on the basis of their abilities to
block receptor ligation by both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx . they
found antibodies that could allosterically block either
 xxxg1144xxx  or  xxxg1146xxx , allosterically block both, or competitively block both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  binding to  xxxg1145xxx .
their epitope mapping studies used three separate constructs, including human  xxxg1145xxx  1–903, mouse 1–904,
and human  xxxg1145xxx  1– 462, which contains the three
n-terminal domains, including l1, the cysteine-rich region, and l2. using a purified  xxxg1145xxx  library including
64 mutations, they found that the epitopes recognized by
antibodies belonging to all four categories bound overlapping surfaces of the cysteine-rich repeat and l2 domains. the surface epitope map analysis of two monoclonal antibodies, biib4 and biib5, and a summary of
the effect of specific  xxxg1145xxx  mutations on  xxxg1144xxx  and
antibody binding are shown in fig. 15. biib4 blocks
 xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  competitively, whereas biib5 blocks
both ligands through an allosteric mechanism. furthermore, the authors found that binding of  xxxg1144xxx  and these
antibodies resulted in conformation changes in  xxxg1145xxx 
(doern et al., 2009). these detailed studies may prove
invaluable in dissecting the properties of individual antibodies that render optimal results in subsequent clinical trials.
at least eight different monoclonal antibodies directed
at the  xxxg1145xxx  are currently under development or are
being assessed in clinical trials. each exhibits unique

characteristics and has been developed using different
strategies. these have been nicely reviewed recently
(feng and dimitrov, 2008). a spectrum of receptor internalization and blocking activities found among these
antibodies should thus put the findings of doern et al.
(2009) into a perspective of clinical efficacy. in brief,
figitumumab (cp-751,871) represents a fully human
igg2 exhibiting a binding affinity to  xxxg1145xxx  of 1.5 nm
and an ic50 of 0.4 nm for inhibition of  xxxg1145xxx  autophosphorylation in nih 3t3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells (cohen et al.,
2005). this blockade of  xxxg1144xxx - and  xxxg1146xxx -provoked
phosphorylation was rapid, as was the inhibition of akt/
pkb activation. cp-751,871 induced a loss of total cellular  xxxg1145xxx  and the down-regulation of surface receptor
as a consequence of internalization. although it failed to
cross-react with ir, this antibody could recognize  xxxg1145xxx /ir heterodimeric complexes in mcf7 cells (cohen et
al., 2005). it is noteworthy that this antibody does not
exhibit cellular toxicity while inhibiting the proliferation of nih 3t3/ xxxg1145xxx  cells in a concentration-dependent manner. this antiproliferative activity was also
found in human colon (colo-205), lung (h460), and
breast (mcf7) xenograph models when administered,
either as a single agent or in combination with doxorubicin (adriamycin) or 5-fluorouracil (cohen et al., 2005).
a phase i clinical trial examining cp-751,871 including
24 patients with refractory solid tumors has been completed, and the compound was found to be safe, with

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

hyperglycemia reported in 4% of patients (pollak et al.,
2007). a phase ii study is ongoing and includes 14 subjects with adrenocortical carcinoma and 16 with sarcoma (feng and dimitrov, 2008). nine of the patients
with adrenal tumors and three patients with sarcoma
exhibited stable disease of a duration greater than 8
weeks (olmos et al., 2007).
 xxxd1711xxx  ( xxxd1711xxx ) is another fully humanized
monoclonal antibody (burtrum et al., 2003; rowinsky et
al., 2007). it derives from a human naive fab phage
display library. clones were selected for their ability to
block binding of 125i to recombinant  xxxg1145xxx . the antibody inhibits the binding of both  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  to the
receptor on mcf-7 cells but does not alter insulin binding. it also attenuates  xxxg1144xxx -dependent proliferation of
mcf-7, rpmi8226, and bxpc-3 cells in vitro (burtrum
et al., 2003). the latest version of this antibody (a12)
binds  xxxg1145xxx  with an affinity of 40 pm. it blunts igf-idependent  xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation and downstream signaling. in human xenograph mouse models,  xxxd1711xxx 
inhibited the growth of mcf-7, bxpc-3, and colo205,
and it attenuated receptor autophosphorylation, whereas tumor cell apoptosis increased (burtrum et al., 2003). multiple phase i trials revealed reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts and hyperglycemia in some subjects. a
minority of subjects had stable disease over the course of
4 to 10 months (higano et al., 2007; rothenberg et al.,
2007; rowinsky et al., 2007).
biib-022 is the product of a human fab phage display library and represents another fully human antibody with an affinity for  xxxg1145xxx  of 1.3 nm (feng and
dimitrov, 2008). it inhibits  xxxg1144xxx  and  xxxg1146xxx  binding
and exhibits specificity for  xxxg1145xxx  in that it fails to
bind ir. early preclinical studies suggest that biib022 will be well tolerated (hariharan et al., 2007).
determination of its efficacy as an antineoplastic
agent awaits the conclusion of ongoing studies. several characteristics of this antibody suggest that it
might prove useful in autoimmune diseases, including
its high affinity for the receptor protein and its safety
profile.
a humanized monoclonal antibody generated by immunizing mice with  xxxg1145xxx , designated h7c10, inhibits
the activity of  xxxg1145xxx  and  xxxg1145xxx /ir hybrid proteins
(goetsch et al., 2005). in nude mice harboring either
mcf-7 human breast cancer cells or a549 non–smallcell lung cancer xenographs, h7c10 significantly inhibited xenotransplanted tumor growth. the effects were
even more dramatic when the antibody was given in
combination with another chemotherapeutic agent or
with a second antibody targeting egfr (goetsch et al.,
2005).
the humanized monoclonal antibody  xxxd3313xxx  was generated in  xxxd2207xxx -producing transgenic mice immunized with  xxxg1145xxx  (schnitzer et al., 2006). it exhibits
antitumor activity in mice harboring 3t3/ xxxg1145xxx , ncih322m or colo205 xenotransplants. the drug seems to

227

be well tolerated, although carbohydrate intolerance after oral glucose challenge was detected in some subjects
(rondon et al., 2007). ave-1642, the human derivative
of mouse antibody em164, has already entered into clinical testing (feng and dimitrov, 2008). em164 blocks
 xxxg1144xxx  binding and  xxxg1144xxx -dependent autophosphorylation of  xxxg1145xxx , slows the proliferation of several cancer
cell lines in vitro, and results in the regression of
bxpc-3 human pancreatic tumors in scid mice (maloney et al., 2003). moreover, it interferes with  xxxg1145xxx 
signaling in cd45⫺ but not in cd45⫹ human myeloma
cells (descamps et al., 2006). ave1642 selectively
inhibits the proliferation of cd45⫺ myeloma cells but
enhances bortezomib-induced apoptosis (descamps et
al., 2009). this effect is apparently absent in cd45⫹
cells and suggests a degree of target cell specificity
that might prove attractive in treating autoimmune
diseases.
besides  xxxg1145xxx  overexpression, some tumors, including those developing from breast epithelium, can form
hybrid  xxxg1145xxx /ir receptor proteins. levels of these chimeric proteins can also increase with tumor dedifferentiation (siddle et al., 1994; pandini et al., 1999). specific
antibodies exhibit activity selectively against these chimeric receptors (pandini et al., 1999) and can also downregulate ir levels (sachdev et al., 2006). whether chimeric  xxxg1145xxx /ir receptors play any role in autoimmune
diseases or occur naturally in the immune system is
uncertain but must be examined if we are to fully understand the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway in this context.
b. kinase inhibitors and other nonantibody targeting
of  xxxg1145xxx 
a summary of the approaches currently considered attractive for altering  xxxg1145xxx  signaling in disease states has
been provided (fig. 16). monoclonal antibody development
has taken priority by many interested in drug development. another approach to therapeutically target  xxxg1145xxx 
in cancer involves small-molecule kinase inhibitors with
variable degrees of selectivity. many inhibitory small molecules exhibiting activity against  xxxg1145xxx  are currently undergoing evaluation for their efficacy against neoplastic
diseases. this avenue of discovery has been problematic
because of the lack of specificity. specifically, targeting
kinases downstream from  xxxg1145xxx  with small molecules
can effectively attenuate receptor-dependent signaling.
however, given the substantial overlap exhibited by many
relevant signaling pathways, interrupting these downstream kinases may result in unwanted collateral effects.
one strategy for overcoming this commonality has been
the utilization of sequence-specific nucleic acid probes,
such as antisense and small interfering rnas. chemical
inhibitor development has focused on the  xxxg2198xxx 
domain contained in  xxxg1145xxx ␤, which can be selectively
inhibited with agents such as cis-3-[3-(4-methyl- xxxd2960xxx -lyl)-cyclobutyl]-1-(2-phenyl-quinolin-7-yl)-imidazo[1,5a]pyrazin-8-ylamine (ji et al., 2007). this recently de-

scribed compound exhibits a high degree of specificity in
that 32 other kinases were unaffected or minimally susceptible to its inhibition. in human geo colon cancer cells,
cis-3-[3-(4-methyl- xxxd2960xxx -l-yl)-cyclobutyl]-1-(2-phenylquinolin-7-yl)-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazin-8-ylamine could block
the phosphorylation of akt and erk 1/2 and disrupt the
 xxxg1146xxx / xxxg1145xxx  autocrine loop (ji et al., 2007).  xxxd2748xxx , an inhibitor of the her2 and  xxxg1145xxx 
tyrosine kinases, blocks the growth of her2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells (zavodovskaya et al., 2008).
 xxxd1383xxx  (or  xxxd1383xxx ), is a novel dual  xxxg2198xxx 

inhibitor of both focal adhesion kinase and  xxxg1145xxx  that
suppresses growth and invasion of glioma cells (liu et al.,
2007). the  xxxg1145xxx -specific kinase inhibitor nvp- xxxd87xxx 
induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells exhibiting autocrine  xxxg1144xxx  secretion (tazzari et al., 2007). 1,3disubstituted-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazines might represent
important inhibitors of  xxxg1144xxx  action (mulvihill et al., 2007).
included among them is picropodophyllin, which demonstrates remarkable specificity for  xxxg1145xxx  and fails to alter
tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors for insulin, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or epi-

 xxxg1144xxx  and immunity

dermal growth factor (girnita et al., 2004). this agent
induces cell-cycle accumulation and apoptosis in multiple
myeloma cells (strömberg et al., 2006). cyclolignan
picropodophyllin inhibits  xxxg1145xxx   xxxg2198xxx  activity through an induction of g2/m-phase accumulation and apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells (strömberg
et al., 2006). a (1h-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1h-pyridin-2-one
inhibitor of  xxxg1145xxx  kinase,  xxxd1291xxx , exhibits antitumor activity in vivo (vaira et al., 2007). the selective
kinase inhibitor nvp-adw742 has exhibited substantial antitumor activity in multiple myeloma and solid
tumors when administered as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic agents (mitsiades et al., 2004).
each of the compounds exhibits potentially acceptable
side-effect profiles that may warrant consideration for
use in autoimmune diseases.
in addition to using single-target approaches in
modifying  xxxg1145xxx  activity, combining anti- xxxg1145xxx  antibody or  xxxg1145xxx  kinase inhibitors with a second inhibitor directed at one of the signaling pathways downstream
from the receptor might enhance both efficacy and specificity. for instance, monoclonal antibodies against  xxxg1145xxx 
in combination with chemical inhibition of the raf/mek/
erk and  xxxg1743xxx  kinase/akt/mtor pathways can effectively
suppress  xxxg1145xxx -dependent proliferation in the hematopoietic cell line fdc-p1 rendered  xxxg1177xxx -independent (bertrand et al., 2006). however, the potential for this approach to attenuate necessary signaling initiated by other
receptors makes its safety profile uncertain.
ix. conclusions
discovery that  xxxg1144xxx  regulates diverse aspects of tcell, b-cell, and monocyte function through its interactions with  xxxg1145xxx  opens several potentially exciting avenues for drug development. its complex role in immune
function suggests that abnormalities in the  xxxg1144xxx  pathway might play some part in the pathogenesis of diseases where immunity is altered. indeed, recent studies
suggest that several autoimmune processes, such as
graves’ disease, rheumatoid arthritis, eae, and inflammatory bowel disease might involve derangements of
this pathway. expression of  xxxg1144xxx  and/or  xxxg1145xxx  seems
to be elevated in these diseases, suggesting similarities
with certain forms of cancer. elevated  xxxg1145xxx  levels and
abnormal  xxxg1145xxx -dependent signaling in tumors are
currently being exploited as therapeutic targets (pollak,
2008; kleinberg et al., 2009). these strategies for drug
development in cancer should provide valuable lessons
for therapy innovation in autoimmunity. however, the
roles of the  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  pathway in chronic autoimmunity are likely to prove very complex. on the one hand,
 xxxg1144xxx  seems to protect against pancreatic islet tissue
damage in some models of type i diabetes and retards
demyelination in animals with eae. on the other,
 xxxg1145xxx  overexpression may play an important role in
the development of graves’ disease and ra, in part by

229

orchestrating the abnormal expansion of pathogenic
lymphocytes and their trafficking to sites of inflammation and tissue remodeling. blocking  xxxg1145xxx  and the
abnormal downstream signaling events it initiates could
prove effective therapy for those conditions. one of many
remaining questions concerns the apparent absence of
increased autoimmunity in transgenic mice overexpressing  xxxg1145xxx . if overexpression of that receptor were
the only requirement for anti- xxxg1145xxx  auto-antibody production, shouldn’t we expect these animals to manifest
graves’ disease or one of the other allied processes? the
answer to this question may lie in the timing and duration of receptor overexpression. for instance, if the
higher levels of  xxxg1145xxx  date back to very early in life,
these animals might become peripherally tolerant to the
protein. moreover, the tissue distribution of overexpressed  xxxg1145xxx , like any other potential self-antigen,
might represent a critical determinant for loss of immune tolerance. lack of sufficient time for disease development might also explain why these animals have
not manifested recognizable disease. other overarching
questions remain, even as we learn more about these
diseases and the roles that  xxxg1144xxx  might play in their
pathogenesis. not the least of these uncertainties concerns whether down-regulating  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx  function
as a therapeutic strategy will ultimately prove sufficiently well tolerated to be used in sublethal diseases.
this will be answered ultimately with the successful
execution of well designed clinical trials. nevertheless,
hints regarding the suitability of these sorts of interventions already exist. treatment of autoimmune disease
has been dramatically transformed with the emergence
of monoclonal antibodies directed at various cytokines
(tincani et al., 2007; guzman moreno, 2009), whereas
other antibodies have been used for b- and t-lymphocyte depletion (chatenoud et al., 1994; hasegawa et al.,
2006). those directed against proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-␣ and il-1 have become mainstays of
therapy in many autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, sle, and multiple sclerosis.
moreover, rituximab has become widely and successfully used as a strategy for depleting cd20 b cells in
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and a number of other autoimmune diseases (ahuja et al., 2007; dörner et al.,
2009).  xxxd2676xxx  therapy is under evaluation in type i
diabetes (herold et al., 2002). success in treating several
autoimmune diseases with these antibodies might be
considered “proof of principle,” because consideration is
given to using similar molecules to disrupt  xxxg1144xxx / xxxg1145xxx 
signaling. accumulating additional insight into the abnormal behavior of this pathway in autoimmunity will allow a
more thorough assessment of its suitability as a therapeutic target.
