very few nonpeptide oxytocin agonists have currently been reported, and none of them seem suitable for
the in vivo investigation of the oxytocin mediated functions. in an attempt to rationalize the design of
better tools, we have systematically studied the structural determinants of the affinity and efficacy of
representative ligands of the v1a, v2, and  xxxg1642xxx  subtypes. despite apparently obvious similarity
between the ligand structures on one hand, and between the receptor subtypes on the other hand, the
binding affinity and the functional activity profiles of truncated and hybrid ligands highlight the subtlety
of ligand-receptor interactions for obtaining nonpeptide  xxxg1642xxx  agonists.

introduction
numerous animal studies have provided evidence supporting a role for oxytocin (ota) and vasopressin (avp) in
many central nervous system (cns) functions including
mating, affiliation, adult pairing and faithfulness, anxiety,
and prosocial behaviors.1-6 in humans, ot has been reported
to improve trust7-9 and to decrease fear associated to social
phobia10-12 and symptoms related to autism.13-20 however,
the only molecular probe that is currently available to study
these functions, both in animals (usually after intracerebroventricular administration) and humans (after intranasal
administration), is oxytocin itself or closely related peptide
analogues that have a poor bioavailability inherent with most
neuropeptides (e.g., poor intestinal and blood-brain barrier
penetration, short half-life, rapid clearance). to characterize
without ambiguity the different central mechanisms of action
and physiopathological functions of vasopressin and oxytocin,

there was an urgent need for centrally active, potent, specific,
and bioavailable agonists and antagonists of the four vasopressin and  xxxg1642xxx  subtypes, namely the v1a, v1b,
v2, and ot receptors. such antagonists became recently
available.21 however, very few nonpeptide agonists have been
reported.22 for  xxxg1642xxx  agonists, the most interesting to
date (compound 1, figure 1) is the optimized analogue of a hit
discovered by systematic screening.23,24 however, its structure
does not seem optimal for cns in vivo studies because its
molecular weight (mw = 600.8 da) and its number of
h-bonds (14 h-bonds possible) remain rather high.25 in addition, some of its hydrophobicity parameters do not fit the
requirements for a significant blood-brain barrier penetration
(ideal clogp = 2 but high psa = 121 å2). furthermore, its
efficacy and selectivity profile had to be further explored. we
have used this molecule and closely related analogues acting at
other vasopressin receptor subtypes to systematically explore
the structural determinants of affinity, efficacy, and selectivity
at v1a, v2, and  xxxg1642xxx  subtypes. our strategy consisted in
two steps. first, we tried to dissect compound 1 to identify the
minimum molecular components required for affinity and to
evaluate their positive (agonism) or negative (antagonism)
contribution to efficacy on the three considered receptor subtypes. to this end, truncated analogues were prepared and their
affinity and efficacy were measured in parallel on the target
receptors. second, we systematically prepared hybrid molecules combining the apparently homologous molecular fragments of four representative vasopressin/oxytocin ligands
(table 1): compound 1, a claimed  xxxg1642xxx  agonist;24
compound 2, a reported nonselective v1a/v2/ xxxg1642xxx 
antagonist;26 compound 3, way-vna-932, a  xxxg231xxx 
agonist;27 and compound 4, l-371,257, the structurally closest
and selective  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist.28 the affinity and efficacy of these chimeric molecules for the v1a, v2, and ot
receptor subtypes were studied to probe the contribution to

on the mode of action of very similar ligands on very similar

chemistry
reference compounds 2, 3, and 4 were prepared according to
literature protocols.26-28 compound 1 and analogues 12a-c
were prepared according to scheme 1. the general procedure is
similar to the synthesis previously described by pitt et al.24,29 with
some optimization, specifically for the cyclization step leading to
the lactam 6. the original preparation consisting of reflux in

 xxxd2400xxx  for 14 days in the presence of acetic acid was
difficult to reproduce. however, a 89% yield could be achieved
by heating the precursor 5 in a sealed tube at 160 °c for 48 h. as
described for compound 1, the urea truncated analogues 12a and
12b could be isolated in high yields after coupling with the
common amine intermediate 10 via preactivation with carbonyldiimidazole (cdi). alternatively, the acetylated truncated
analogue 12c was obtained by reacting 10 with acetic anhydride.
a similar synthetic route was followed for the preparation
of compounds 23a-d, according to the general scheme 2. the
polycyclic amines 13, 14, and 15 were prepared according to
literature protocols.30-32 in addition, with regard to the
synthesis of the analogue 23c, the key acid intermediate 20
was prepared starting from the acyl chloride 16 via a sandmeyer reaction to introduce the nitrile group.
as described in scheme 3, the hybrid compound 27 was
prepared in a similar manner as the reference compound 2.
finally, both hybrids 31a and 31b were obtained following a
general route described by kondo et al.33

the functional agonist and competitive antagonist properties of each ligand were determined for the human vasopressin
and oxytocin receptors subtypes stably expressed in cho
cells. the accumulation of myo-inositol 1-phosphate (v1a and
ot receptors) was determined by the ip-one assay and the
accumulation of camp ( xxxg231xxx ) was determined by the
camp dynamic 2 assay, both kindly provided by cisbio
international. these immunoassays are based on the competition between free ip1 or camp and ip1-d2 or camp-d2
conjugate, respectively (for more information on the principle, see http://www.htrf.com/products/gpcr/ipone and http://
www.htrf.com/products/gpcr/camp).
molecular modeling
a three-dimensional model [model coordinates are available upon request] of the  xxxg1642xxx  was built and
refined based on the sequence alignment and the v1a model
previously published by our group.37 the quality of this new

model was assessed by docking first the endogenous peptide
ligand oxytocin (see figure s1 in supporting information).
ot and compound 1 were docked to this preliminary model
using the gold 3.0 program.38 the starting conformation of
ot was modeled from the x-ray structure of neurophysinbound ot.39 compound 1 was built starting from the x-ray
structure of its truncated analogue 12c, and its geometry was
fully optimized with hf/6-31* level using gaussian 03.40 the
resulting binding mode of compound 1 obtained was similar
to the oxytocin binding mode (figure 3).

the  xxxg231xxx  subtype (ec50 = 850 nm) was evaluated in a
similar way (cre-luciferase). furthermore, 1 was shown to
be active in vivo after iv bolus administration in a rat model
of uterine response. we have extended the characterization
in studying the binding profile of this lead compound at the
ot, v1a, and v2 oxytocin and vasopressin receptor subtypes.
furthermore, its agonist and antagonist functional efficacy
was directly measured at the level of the second messengers.
in terms of binding affinity, 1 was less potent than
expected at the  xxxg1642xxx  with ki = 147 nm (table 1).
its affinity for the v1a and  xxxg231xxx  subtypes was ki =
330 nm and ki >1000 nm, respectively. in terms of functional
efficacy, 1 showed a weak but substantial agonist activity at
the ot (kact = 667 nm) and v2 (kact = 599 nm) receptors but
not at the  xxxg229xxx . however, the activation did not reach
the level induced by ot or avp, indicating a partial agonist
profile with an emax of 58% and 84% for ot and v2
receptors, respectively. the capacity of 1 to antagonize the
endogenous ligand activation was also measured. in the
conditions of the study, compound 1 showed some weak
antagonist effect at the  xxxg1642xxx , no significant effect at
the  xxxg231xxx , and a marked v1a antagonist effect (kinact =
271 nm). overall, compound 1 is a moderately active ligand of
the  xxxg1642xxx  with a marginal selectivity versus the v1a
receptor and a larger selectivity versus the v2 site (>7 fold). at
the level of second messengers, it behaves as a partial agonist
of the ot and v2 receptors and as a slightly more potent
antagonist at the  xxxg229xxx . the apparent discrepancy
between the reported ec50 and full efficacy at ot receptors
derived from a gene reporter assay24 and the affinity and
efficacy measured here from radioligand binding and second
messenger analysis can easily be explained by the fact that the
gene reporter assays reflect a downstream effect with several
levels of signal amplification. the extension of profiling to the
 xxxg229xxx  subtype unmasked the weak selectivity of compound 1, hampering its usefulness as a pharmacological
investigation probe. however, this molecule remains a very
interesting tool to investigate the ligand-receptor interactions
at the molecular level and more particularly the structural

determinants for the agonism/antagonism switch. the
binding and the switch from agonist to antagonist among
g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) ligands remain a key
issue for drug design. the vasopressin-oxytocin receptors
represent a very interesting system to investigate this question. indeed, the different receptor subtypes are very similar
(37% to 47% identity), they are activated by the same
endogenous agonist,  xxxd3495xxx  (avp), they have
been cloned in many species including humans,41 many
peptidic and nonpeptidic ligands are known, and threedimensional models validated by many experimental data
are available.34-37,42-59
among the structurally diverse nonpeptide ligands of
vasopressin receptors disclosed over the years, the tetrahydrobenzazepine/benzodiazepine series is one of the most
important so far. ligands of this class are active at three of
the four receptor subtypes, often exhibiting potent antagonist properties at the v1a and/or v2 receptors, and sometimes
a non-negligible  xxxg1642xxx  antagonist activity (e.g., compound
2).21 to date, very few nonpeptide agonists acting at these
receptors have been reported.22 interestingly, the only ones

belong to the benzazepine series (e.g., compound 3).27,60-62
their v2-r agonist properties were discovered as a result of
structural modifications of the antagonists.33,63 intriguingly, the
first nonpeptide  xxxg1642xxx  agonist (compound 1) is also related to
the said chemical class.24 therefore, a systematic study of these
remarkably subtle relationships between these particular ligands
should be of outstanding interest to clarify the structural determinants conferring them such agonist/antagonist properties.
thus, in our attempts to understand the structural origin
of compound 1  xxxg1642xxx  agonist activity, we decided to
cleave the structure progressively or to combine its fragments
with fragments from a reported nonselective v1a/v2/ot
receptor antagonist, compound 2, a  xxxg231xxx  agonist,
way-vna-932, compound 3, and a benzoxazinone-type

truncated analogues. as seen from table 2, the removal of
the thioamide-homopiperazine from compound 1 (compound
12a) led to a very significant decrease in affinity for  xxxg1642xxx 
because a very low [3h]avp displacement could be observed
at a 1 mum concentration. no agonist activity could be
detected, and a 37% inhibition of the response induced by
ot could be observed at 1 mum, suggesting a weak and

marginally reinforced antagonist effect compared to 1. additional cleavage leading to the urea 12b and to the  xxxd63xxx 
12c resulted in a complete loss of affinity and efficacy for the
 xxxg1642xxx . again, some weak but significant antagonistic
activity could still be detected for 12b. one may then conclude
that the eastern fragment of molecule 1 contributes significantly to its affinity for the  xxxg1642xxx . the lack of agonist
efficacy and some residual antagonist activity in compound
12a suggested that the homopiperazine fragment is necessary
for the  xxxg1642xxx  activation. the same trend was observed
on the  xxxg231xxx  subtype. the initial affinity was very weak
and remained as such in compounds 12a and 12b. however, in
contrast to  xxxg1642xxx , the agonist character persisted in the series
of analogues although very weakened. no antagonist activity
could be detected. finally, on the  xxxg229xxx  subtype, the
affinity was slightly reinforced upon truncating the molecule,
as indicated by both the affinity and the antagonist efficacy of
1, 12a, and 12b. however, the ultimate transformation of the
urea in 12b into an  xxxd63xxx  in 12c was completely detrimental to the activity.
this first part of the study highlighted the crucial role of
the entire chain for the  xxxg1642xxx  affinity of 1 and the specific
contribution of the homopiperazine fragment to its agonist
efficacy. unexpectedly, it also highlighted the divergent

hybrid molecules. to further explore this sar divergence, we prepared and analyzed the hybrid molecules in
tables 3 and 4. a simple qualitative analysis of these ligands
strongly suggested a shared pharmacophore around a central benzoyl fragment branched with a polycyclic aromatic
amide on the western side and an aromatic or electron-rich
side chain on the opposite para position (eastern). it was
tempting to assume that similar fragments bind to similar
regions and trigger similar effects in the highly homologous
receptor subtypes.
the contribution of the western tricyclic part was first
studied. unexpectedly, despite the fact that compounds 2, 3,
and 4 had a good or very good affinity for the  xxxg1642xxx , better
or comparable to 1, the introduction of their aromatic
fragments in the structure of 1 led to a significant (23a,b,d)
to dramatic (23c) decrease in affinity for the  xxxg1642xxx 
(table 3). the efficacy decreased in a parallel fashion for 23a

journal of medicinal chemistry, 2010, vol. 53, no. 4 1551

and 23b. even more surprisingly, the chimeric ligand 23d
switched from ot agonist to ot antagonist upon this ring
replacement. in a general manner, the affinity and efficacy
on the v1a and v2 homologous receptors were also decreased
without change in the efficacy profile.
these results led to two conclusions. the highly similar
cyclic aromatic fragments of the different ligands do not
contribute in the same way to their activity, probably interacting in different manners with a given receptor as well as
with the different homologous receptor subtypes. the aromatic cyclic fragments of molecules 1, 2, and 3 stabilize the
active conformation of the  xxxg1642xxx , whereas the piperidino-benzoxazinone of 4 stabilizes an inactive conformation. interestingly, both benzazepine and piperidinobenzoxazinone moieties actually derive from structural
modifications of the quinolinone ligand opc-21268, the first
nonpeptide vasopressin receptor ligand described.28,64,65
structurally speaking, there is a reasonably good similarity
between the piperidino-benzoxazinone fragment of 4 and the
benzazepine moiety. they both contain a cyclic aromatic
moiety likely to interact with aromatic residues in the active
site. they are both connected to the rest of the molecules by
an amide link. the discriminant feature could be the distance
between the aromatic ring and the amide link that is slightly
superior in the piperidino-benzoxazinone moiety.
the contribution of the eastern part of the molecule was
then investigated by introducing the side chains of compounds 2 and 3 on the central and western part of 1. once
again, the results were quite unexpected (table 4). the
replacement of the complex electronegative side chain in 1
by the hydrophobic biphenyl amide of 2 led to compound 27
with a conserved  xxxg1642xxx  affinity (ki = 111 nm versus
147 nm). the replacement by the methyl  xxxd3045xxx  directly
branched on the central benzoyl core provided 31a, an even
more potent  xxxg1642xxx  ligand with a ki = 27.8 nm. this
significant increase was unexpected because compounds 2
and 3 have affinity constants similar to 1 (ki = 109 and 199
nm, respectively). however, these replacements caused a
switch in functional efficacy because compounds 27 and
31a are potent  xxxg1642xxx  antagonists (kinact = 557 and
14.8 nm, respectively) without any detectable agonist activity. these results highlight the critical contribution of the
large electron-rich side chain of 1 to its  xxxg1642xxx  activating properties. replacement by smaller, more hydrophobic
fragments increases the affinity but locks the receptor in an
inactive conformation. a similar effect was observed on the
 xxxg231xxx  subtype. compound 27 is also a potent and
selective  xxxg231xxx  antagonist (ki = 6.4 nm, v2/v1a kinact
ratio = 374, v2/ot kinact ratio = 506). in addition, the
affinity for the  xxxg229xxx  subtype increased from 10- to
20-fold (compounds 27 and 31a, respectively) but the initial
antagonist activity was retained.
of interest is also the differential action of the core benzoyl
nucleus common to all ligands. with a methyl group in
position 3, the compound 31a is a potent antagonist for the
v1a and ot receptors and a weak antagonist for the v2
receptor. substitution of the methyl for a chlorine in position
2 led to an equipotent ligand (31b) for the three receptor
subtypes. however, 31b behaves as a full agonist at the v2
and as an antagonist at the v1a and  xxxg1642xxx  subtypes,
highlighting once more the divergent sar among highly
homologous ligands acting at highly homologous receptors.
furthermore, by applying the same modification when
having the large side chain of 1, the affinity for the three

1552 journal of medicinal chemistry, 2010, vol. 53, no. 4

receptor subtypes is dramatically lost, as illustrated by
compounds 23b and 23c (table 3). therefore, one may
hypothesize that a methyl group on the central benzoyl core
seems to be required at position 3 to stabilize this flexible
chain in its active conformation.
the second part of this study highlighted the contribution
to affinity, efficacy, and specificity of each fragment of the
compound 1. with regard to the western tricyclic part, the
benzazepine polycyclic moiety contributes to the affinity and
the stabilization of the active conformation of the ot and v2
receptors, the pyrazolobenzodiazepine scaffold of 1 remaining unequaled (figure 2). by contrast, the piperidino-benzoxazinone is responsible for the  xxxg1642xxx  selectivity and
stabilizes an inactive conformation of this receptor. clearly,
both scaffolds are not interchangeable. regarding the eastern part of the molecule, the large electron-rich side chain of
1 is essential for the  xxxg1642xxx  activation. finally, the
core benzoyl nucleus is not just a common linker but can
lock/unlock a specific conformation of the ligand through its
different substitution patterns.
in summary, the design and synthesis of several truncated
analogues of 1 and of hybrid molecules enabled us to identify
the key structural features responsible for its affinity and
 xxxg1642xxx  agonist efficacy. although it was tempting to assume
that similar fragments bind to similar regions and trigger
similar effects in the highly homologous receptor subtypes,
the reality is definitely not so straightforward. indeed, each
part of the molecule appears to play a specific role for its
activity on the  xxxg1642xxx , and quite surprising findings arose from this systematic study regarding its behavior
toward the other vasopressin receptor subtypes. the main
conclusion remains that the  xxxg1642xxx  agonist activity of compound 1 is mainly conferred by this large, rather polar,
pseudopeptidic side chain present at its eastern part. the
cleavage of this polar side chain and its replacement by a
smaller group did not afford an  xxxg1642xxx  agonist as it does with
the same backbone on the v2-r.33,63 for bioamine receptors
ligands, which have to reach a deep binding cleft between the
helices, agonists are typically smaller than antagonists.66,67
indeed, the switch from an antagonist to an agonist for
nonpeptide receptors is generally achieved by the suppression of a bulky lipophilic side chain. obviously, it may be
more subtle for peptide receptor ligands, whose binding site
also includes the extracellular region. the large size of
peptides often allows the discrimination of the binding and
the activation domains, both on the peptide ligand and the
target receptor. this address and message concept has been
widely explored and often validated.46,49,54,68,69 a priori, this

frantz et al.

separation renders the design of small size, potent agonists
more difficult. however, morphine represents a very good
example showing that a small nonpeptide molecule is able to
mimic a peptide in combining affinity and functional activity
on a limited molecular entity. furthermore, the switch from
agonist to antagonist on morphine skeleton follows essentially the same rules as for biogenic amine receptor ligands
and can be achieved by substitution with hydrophobic fragments.70 by contrast, other examples have shown that a
nonpeptide antagonist ligand of a peptide receptor could be
converted into an agonist by introduction of an additional
hydrophobic interaction or steric constraint.69,71,72 this
phenomenon has also been studied on several receptors via
mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling of structurally similar agonist and antagonist ligands.73-87 as shown here, the
side-chain decrease strategy leads indeed to a conserved
agonist character or a switch from antagonist to agonist
for the  xxxg231xxx  subtype but did not operate for the ot
and v1a receptors, demonstrating that the structural determinants of the antagonist/agonist switch are probably
specific to every receptor-ligand complex. we have attempted to obtain an explanation for these observed subtle
affinity and efficacy switches in analyzing molecular models
of the  xxxg1642xxx  binding to ot, the endogenous ligand, or
to compound 1, a partial agonist.
molecular modeling. models for the ot, v1a, v1b, and v2
receptors interacting with diverse ligands had previously
been proposed and partly validated experimentally.42-59
they were derived from reference gpcr experimental
structures with different levels of relevance and resolution.
however, they proved to be sufficiently qualitative to predict
binding pocket localization, residues responsible for affinity,
species, and receptor specificity. we attempted to go one step
further in understanding the agonism-antagonism switch
for compound 1 using the best current reference templates
for gpcr modeling. a three-dimensional model of the
 xxxg1642xxx  was built and refined based on the
sequence alignment and the v1a model previously published
by our group.37 the quality of this new model was assessed
by docking the endogenous peptide ligand oxytocin (see
figure s1 in supporting information). in agreement with
most studies, the hydrophobic part of oxytocin (tyr2 and
ile3) is accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket (m3.36,
w6.48, f6.51) lying in the deep 7-transmembrane (tm)
cavity between tms iii, v, vi, and vii. an important
h-bonds network is established between the conserved glutamine residues (q3.32, q4.60, q6.55) located at the upper rim
of the cavity and the polar part of the peptide hormone,
i.e., the main chain atoms as well as gln4, asn5, and also
the tyr2 side chain. similar interactions have also been
described for avp into v1a-r and v1b-r in our most
recent models37 as well as in previously published binding
modes.43,48 moreover, the n-terminal gly9 of ot is interacting with e1.35 via hydrogen bonding. thus, a very tiny
network of hydrogen bonds is used to anchor ot to its
receptor. on the other hand, leu8 of ot is pointed to the
f2.68, located close to the extracellular loop e1, as proposed
previously.44 noteworthy, most residues proposed to participate in ot binding have been shown to be of crucial
importance for avp agonist peptide binding using sitedirected mutagenesis.43,48,49 thus, although our ot binding
has not been experimentally validated, we believe that our
 xxxg1642xxx  model is a good starting point for docking other
agonists.

compound 1 was docked in this model in an attempt to
gain insight into the agonism-antagonism switch. the
resulting binding mode obtained was similar to the oxytocin
binding mode (figure 3). more precisely, a well-defined
negatively charged subsite (e1.35, d2.65) perfectly accommodates the positively charged basic amine at the eastern
part of compound 1. very recently, we demonstrated that
this subsite represents a key anchoring point for the arg8
residue of avp and related peptide agonists in v1a and v1b
receptors.37 the western part of compound 1 is anchored via
h-bonds formed between its nitrogen-enriched tricyclic
fused ring and the conserved q4.60 as well as the carbonyl
belonging to the backbone of k3.29. a possible aromatic
stacking interaction is also likely between the central benzene
ring of the ligand and the conserved f6.51 of the receptor.
consequently, this novel oxytocin nonpeptide agonist
series represented by compound 1 seems to bind to the
receptor in a similar way that the peptide ligand does. the
extended pseudopeptidic structure of 1 seems to mimic
the size and the shape of oxytocin itself and to establish the
interactions necessary to activate the  xxxg1642xxx .
indeed, our results indicate that the end of the eastern part
of compound 1 is required for  xxxg1642xxx  activation and one can
imagine that the basic amine of the homopiperazine fragment would be the key anchoring point to the receptor in
order to confer agonism to the ligand. according to our
model, this nitrogen can be in close contact with three
possible acidic residues of the  xxxg1642xxx , namely e1.35,
d2.65 and the conserved d of the extracellular loop e2.
interestingly, only d2.65 is not conserved in the  xxxg231xxx ,
where it is replaced by a k. this might explain why compound 1 has a very low affinity and efficacy for the v2
receptor which binds and responds to the small hydrophobic
agonist way-vna-932. nevertheless, this model is not
sufficient to explain the agonism of compound 1 at the ot
receptor and its antagonism at the  xxxg229xxx  because
oxytocin itself has no positive charge at the region considered
and the three acidic residues are conserved in v1a-r.
thus, studying the gpcr activation mechanisms still
remains challenging. a lot of work has been done on
the rhodopsin and the beta2-adrenergic class 1 receptors.88,89
according to the proposed toggle switch model,89 a 90°
rotation of the crucial conserved w6.48 side chain would

lead to the movement of tm vi and tm vii around the
highly conserved proline kinks, while the intracellular segments would move away from tm iii to expose specific
epitopes, and the extracellular segments would get closer to
tm iii to close the binding site. the receptor would be
maintained in its inactive conformation by an aromatic
cluster in tm v and vi, stabilizing the w6.48. the antagonist binding mode is located deep in the transmembrane
domain and based on sufficiently strong interactions with the
hydrophobic and aromatic residues of tm iv, v, vi, and
vii, in order to prevent w6.48 rotation, maintaining the
receptor in its inactive conformation. the agonist would
adopt a more superficial binding mode between tm iii, vi,
and vii and close to tm iii to allow rotation of the w6.48
located at the opposite part of the cavity. established interactions are thus rather polar, with some hydrophobic contacts able to disturb the aromatic cluster. in stabilizing the
active receptor conformation, small agonists would act as a
molecular glue in the main cavity between the helices,
whereas peptides would play the role of velcro at the upper
helical bundle and the extracellular loops, to maintain these
helices together for an extended time. small v2-r agonists
would bind in a position close to tm iii to not disturb the
w6.48 rotation. because of subtle differences of topology of
the cavity in  xxxg1642xxx , interaction of these ligands with the
aromatic cluster of tm vi would be too strong. on the
contrary, the eastern chain of the  xxxg1642xxx  agonist 1 would
bring additional interactions with the upper part of tm i and
ii, allowing the molecule to move upward, thus acting as
velcro in peptide mimicry.
conclusions
the binding mode and the switch from antagonist to
agonist among gpcr ligands remain a key issue for drug
design. the vasopressin-oxytocin receptors and their ligands
represent a very convenient model system to address such an
issue because highly homologous ligands binding to highly
homologous binding sites are known. we have explored the
affinity and efficacy shifts around compound 1, which is the
lead of the first series of  xxxg1642xxx  nonpeptide agonists
described to date. we have fully investigated its binding and
efficacy profiles on the ot, v1a, and v2 oxytocin-vasopressin
receptors. the first important result is that compound 1 is not
a specific, full  xxxg1642xxx  agonist. in our hands, it displays only a
2-fold selectivity versus the  xxxg229xxx  in terms of binding
and behaves as a partial agonist (58%) at the  xxxg1642xxx , being
equipotent as a v2-r agonist and more potent as a v1a-r
antagonist. this, added to its poor bioavailability, preempts
its use as specific pharmacological probe for studying oxytocin-related functional responses. it remains, however, a very
interesting and relevant tool to explore the oxytocin binding
and efficacy supramolecular determinants. its study leads to
the second conclusion that structure-activity relationships
around vasopressin/oxytocin ligands are extremely subtle and
the determinants for the antagonism/agonism switch are very
difficult to identify. thus, although qualitatively accurate,
three-dimensional models of gpcr still remain of weak
predictive value to address such subtle phenomenon that
might be under kinetic and/or polymolecular control. indeed,
static models can not satisfactory take into account dynamic
processes, conformational changes, loops movements, solvation/desolvation, allosteric interactions, dimerization/oligomerization,90 g protein binding, membrane environment, and

the multitude of parameters intervening in a living cell.
molecular modeling of gpcr, associated with extended
experimental validation, is definitely an additive value to drug
design but, in our hands and in this particular case study, it
reaches its limits. the recent crystallographic structure of the
 xxxg82xxx  further highlights the plasticity of
gpcrs and the difficulty to predict precisely a given ligand
binding mode.91 thus, for the time being, the dual challenge of
discovering a full, bioavailable ot agonist on one hand
and rationally designing a nonpeptide agonist for a peptide
receptor on the other hand remains open. however, waiting
for an  xxxg1642xxx  crystallographic structure and having
in mind that peptide gpcrs represent targets of special
interest for novel therapeutics,92,93 we will continue to combine molecular modeling, sar studies, labeling,34-36,55 and
mutagenesis to take up the challenge.

membrane preparations. to increase the level of expression of
some receptors ( xxxg1642xxx , v1a-r), the cells were treated overnight
with 5 mm  xxxd3211xxx .35,55 as already published, this
treatment does not modify the pharmacological properties of
the receptors. the membranes were prepared as already
described.34-36,50,55 briefly, culture dishes of cho cells expressing the human vasopressin v1a, v2, or oxytocin receptors were
washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline without ca2þ and
mg2þ, and cold lysis buffer (15 mm tris-hcl, 2 mm mgcl2,
0.3 mm edta, ph 7.4) was added. cells were scraped with a
rubber, polytron-homogenized, and centrifuged at 800g for
7 min at 4 °c. supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at
44000g for 25 min at 4 °c. pellets were resuspended in a
suspension medium (50 mm tris-hcl, 5 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4)
and centrifuged at 44000g for 25 min at 4 °c. pellets were
resuspended in an appropriate volume of the same buffer, and
the protein content was determined by the bradford method
(bio-rad) using bsa as the standard. aliquots of membranes
were used immediately for binding assays or stored at -80 °c.
radioligand binding assays. binding assays were performed
at 30 °c using [3h]avp as the radioligand and cho cellsmembrane proteins (10-15 mug for v1a and ot receptors, 5 mug
for  xxxg231xxx ), as previously described.34-36,50,55 briefly,
membranes of cho cells stably expressing human vasopressin
v1a, v2, or oxytocin receptors were incubated for 30 min at 30 °c
in the binding buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, 5 mm mgcl2, 1 mg/ml
bsa, ph 7.4) with the radiolabeled and displacing ligands. the
affinities (kd) of [3h]avp for the human vasopressin v1a, v2,
and oxytocin receptors have already been described earlier in
saturation experiments, respectively kd = (0.70 ( 0.17) nm,
(1.36 ( 0.45) nm, and (1.36 ( 1.00) nm.50,55 the affinities (ki) of
the unlabeled ligands were determined by competition experiments using [3h]avp (1-2 nm) and varying the concentrations
of the displacing ligands from 0.1 pm to 100 mum (without
exceeding a 4% final concentration in dmso). nonspecific
binding was determined by adding an excess of avp (10 mum).
bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration on a
brandel apparatus over whatman gf/c filters presoaked in a
10 mg/ml bsa solution for 3-4 h. radioactivity on the filters
was counted on a beta-counter tricarb 2100tr (packard). the
ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares
regression using the computer program kell radlig. the inhibition constants (ki) for unlabeled ligands were calculated according to the cheng and prusoff equation: ki = ic50/(1 þ [l*]/kd),
where ic50 is the concentration of unlabeled ligand leading to
half-maximal inhibition of specific binding, [l*] is the concentration of the radioligand present in the assay, and kd is its affinity
for the receptor studied. the given ki values are expressed as the
mean ( sem of at least three independent experiments, each
performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified.

functional assays. the functional agonist and competitive
antagonist properties of each ligand were determined for the
human vasopressin and oxytocin receptors subtypes stably
expressed in cho cells. the accumulation of myo-inositol
1-phosphate (v1a and ot receptors) was determined by the
ip-one assay, and the accumulation of camp ( xxxg231xxx ) was
determined by the camp dynamic 2 assay, both kindly provided
by cisbio international. briefly, cho cells stably expressing the
human vasopressin v1a, v2, or oxytocin receptors were seeded
(at 80-90% confluence) at a density of 80000 cells/well for v1a
and ot receptors, and 1000 cells/well for  xxxg231xxx , in 96-well
culture plates (greiner) in their culture medium in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2 at 37 °c overnight. after
removal of the culture medium, ligands in the stimulation buffer
(already furnished in the ip-one kit; d-mem supplemented
with 0.1 mm of the phosphodiesterases inhibitor ro-20-1724
and 1 mg/ml bsa for the camp assay) were added in increasing final concentrations ranging from 10 fm to 100 mum (without
exceeding a 1% final concentration in dmso). to test the
agonist effect, cells were incubated with the ligands for 30 min
(37 °c þ 5% co2), the positive control used being 1 mum avp for
v1a-r, 0.1 mum avp for v2-r, and 1 mum ot for  xxxg1642xxx . to test
the competitive antagonist effect, cells were preincubated with
the ligands for 10 min (37 °c þ 5% co2) and then stimulated by
the corresponding endogenous agonist (2 nm avp for v1a-r,
1 nm avp for v2-r, and 50 nm ot for  xxxg1642xxx ) and incubated
for 30 min (37 °c þ 5% co2). the cells were lysed and incubated
at rt with the ip1-d2 and anti-ip1-cryptate conjugates (ip-one),
or camp-d2 and anti-camp-cryptate conjugates (camp
dynamic 2). after 1-2 h incubation, fluorescence emissions were
measured both at 620 nm and at 665 nm on a rubystar
fluorometer (bmg labtechnologies) equipped with a nitrogen
laser as excitation source (337 nm). a 400 mus reading was
measured after a 50 mus delay to eliminate the short-lived fluorescence background from the specific signal. the fluorescence
intensities measured at 620 nm and at 665 nm correspond to the
total europium cryptate emission and to the fret signal,
respectively. the specific signal was calculated using the following
equation: deltaf = (r - rneg)/rneg. r is the ratio (fluorescence
665 nm/fluorescence 620 nm)  100 calculated in wells incubated
with both donor- and acceptor-labeled antibodies, whereas rneg
is the same ratio for the negative control. the functional data
were analyzed by nonlinear regression using graphpad prism.
for the agonist properties, concentrations of ligands leading to
half-maximal ip1 or camp accumulation (ec50 or activation
constant kact) were calculated from the sigmoidal dose-response
curves, and the maximal responses induced by ligands (emax) are
expressed as percentages of maximal stimulation of ip1 or camp
accumulation by the corresponding endogenous agonist. for the
antagonist properties, concentrations of ligands leading to halfmaximal inhibition (ic50) of ip1 or camp accumulation were
calculated from the inversed sigmoidal dose-response curve. the
inactivation constants (kinact) were calculated as: kinact = ic50/
(1 þ [ago]/kact), where [ago] is the concentration of the endogenous agonist present in the assay ([avp] = 2 nm for v1a-r,
[avp] = 1 nm for v2-r, and [ot] = 50 nm for  xxxg1642xxx ), and kact
is the concentration of this agonist inducing half-maximal stimulation of ip1 or camp accumulation (kact (avp) = (1.20 ( 0.33)
nm for v1a-r, kact (avp) = (0.25 ( 0.07) nm for v2-r, and kact
(ot) = (10.6 ( 0.3) nm for  xxxg1642xxx ). results are expressed as the
mean ( sem of at least three independent experiments, each
performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified.
molecular modeling. the protocol used for molecular modeling studies was as published recently by our group.37 very
briefly, the residue numbering proposed by ballesteros and
weinstein94 was used throughout this manuscript. it allows an
unambiguous comparison of tm residues for any class a
gpcr by assigning position 50 to a fully conserved amino acid
at each tm and numbering other amino acids according to this
reference residue. residue x.y is thus the amino acid describing

1560 journal of medicinal chemistry, 2010, vol. 53, no. 4

position y of tmx. for purposes of clarification, amino acids
from the peptide ligands will be labeled using a three-letter code,
whereas receptor residues will be labeled using a single-letter
code.
the amino acid sequences of human  xxxg1642xxx  was retrieved
from the swiss-prot database and aligned to the sequence of
bovine rhodopsin using the in-house developed gpcrmod
program95 focusing on transmembrane (tm) domains only.
the alignment of the amino and carboxy-terminal domains as
well as of the intra- and extracellular loops was realized using
clustalw.96 modeling the avp-bound conformation of human
v1a and v1b receptors 3-d ground-state models of human v1a and
v1b receptors have recently been reported by our group.37,55,97,98
to achieve an agonist-bound model from an antagonist-bound
model, we followed a five-step protocol as proposed by bissantz
et al.97 it should be observed that the starting conformation of ot
was modeled from the x-ray structure of neurophysin-bound
ot.39 compound 1 was built starting from the x-ray structure of
its truncated analogue 12c, and then it was fully optimized with
hf/6-31* level using geometry optimization with gaussian 03.40
ot and compound 1 were docked to this preliminary model using
the gold 3.0 program.38 for each of the 10 independent genetic
algorithm (ga) runs, a maximum number of 1000 ga operations
was performed on a single population of 50 individuals. operator
weights for crossover, mutation, and migration were set to 100,
100, and 0, respectively. to allow poor nonbonded contacts at the
start of each ga run, the maximum distance between hydrogen
donors and fitting points was set to 5 å, and nonbonded van der
waals energies were cut off at a value equal to kij (well depth of
the van der waals energy for the atom pair i,j). to further speed
up the calculation, the ga docking was stopped when the top
three solutions were within 1.5 å rmsd. if this criterion is met, we
can assume that these top solutions represent a reproducible pose
for the ligand.
