abstract
use-dependent block of na⫹ channels plays an important role
in the action of many medications, including the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. these anticonvulsants all slowly yet selectively bind to a common receptor site in inactivated but not resting na⫹ channels, constituting
the molecular basis of the use-dependent block. however, it
remains unclear what channel gating process “makes” the receptor, where the receptor is located, and how the slow drug
binding rate (to the inactivated channels) is contrived. imipramine has a diphenyl structural motif almost identical to that in
carbamazepine (a dibenzazepine tricyclic compound), as well
as a tertiary amine chain similar to that in many prototypical
local anesthetics, and has also been reported to inhibit na⫹
channels in a use-dependent fashion. we found that imipra-

use-dependent inhibition of neuronal na⫹ currents is an
important pharmacological phenomenon, which plays an essential role in the mechanism of action of many widely prescribed nonsedative anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine) and prototypical local
anesthetics (lidocaine and other “caines”). the molecular basis of the use-dependent inhibition is two-fold. in terms of
steady-state effect, these anticonvulsants and local anesthetics show much higher affinity to the inactivated than to the
resting na⫹ channels and thus selectively bind to the former
rather than the latter (bean et al., 1983; matsuki et al., 1984;
butterworth and strichartz, 1990; kuo and bean, 1994; xie
et al., 1995; kuo and lu, 1997; kuo et al., 1997). in terms of
kinetic attributes, these drugs have slow binding rates onto
the inactivated na⫹ channel during depolarization, so that
binding and “stabilization” of the inactivated na⫹ channels
do not reach the steady state in one short depolarizing pulse
but are gradually accumulated with repeated pulses (and
thus “use-dependent” inhibition of the na⫹ current). the
binding rates of the foregoing anticonvulsants onto the inactivated na⫹ channels, for example, are only ⬃10,000 to

mine selectively binds to the inactivated (dissociation constant
⬃1.3 ␮m) rather than the resting na⫹ channels (dissociation
constant ⬎130 ␮m). moreover, imipramine rapidly blocks open
na⫹ channels, with a binding rate ⬃70-fold faster than its
binding to the inactivated channels. similarly, carbamazepine
and diphenhydramine are open na⫹ channel blockers with
faster binding rates to the open than to the inactivated channels. these findings indicate that the anticonvulsant receptor
responsible for the use-dependent block of na⫹ channels is
located in or near the pore (most likely in the pore mouth) and
is made suitable for drug binding during channel activation. the
receptor, however, continually changes its conformation in the
subsequent gating process, causing the slower drug binding
rates to the inactivated na⫹ channels.

40,000 m⫺1s⫺1 in rat hippocampal neurons (kuo and bean,
1994; kuo et al., 1997; kuo and lu, 1997).
recently, we have shown that phenytoin, carbamazepine,
and lamotrigine probably bind to the same receptor site in
the inactivated na⫹ channel, most likely with the diphenyl
motif as the major binding ligands (fig. 1a; kuo, 1998a; kuo
et al., 2000). a tertiary amine chain, if present in the appropriate position, may also contribute to drug binding (kuo et
al., 2000). the local anesthetics, which usually have only one
phenyl group with a tertiary amine chain, may have their
receptor area overlapping with the anticonvulsant receptor
because some point mutations of the na⫹ channel could
decrease the binding affinity of both groups of drugs (ragsdale et al., 1996; yarov-yarovoy et al., 2001). however, there
is still a possibility that the two groups of drugs have separate but allosterically linked receptors with their conformational changes controlled by the same gating process of the
channel (li et al., 1999).
because inactivation is coupled to activation in na⫹ channels, the resting channel usually is activated and then inactivated upon membrane depolarization. does channel activation or inactivation “make” the anticonvulsant receptor,
which is present in the inactivated but not in the resting
channels? the single na⫹ channel open time was shortened

inhibition of naⴙ current by imipramine

by phenytoin (quandt, 1988) but not local anesthetic lidocaine (benz and kohlhardt, 1992; balser et al., 1996), suggesting that phenytoin is an open channel blocker but lidocaine is not; consequently, lidocaine might be chiefly an
inactivation stabilizer (e.g., bennett et al., 1995, balser et al.,
1996). however, the foregoing experiments were performed
in mutant or chemically modified na⫹ channels deficient of
fast inactivation, and there is always a concern that the drug
receptor may also be directly or allosterically altered by the
modification procedures (e.g., bennett et al., 1995; li et al.,
1999). on the other hand, lidocaine was proposed to block
open na⫹ channel pore or stabilize activated channel conformation based on more indirect evidences such as the biphasic

materials and methods

fig. 1. chemical formulae of the drugs and inhibition of na⫹ currents by
imipramine. a, chemical formulae of imipramine, carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and lamotrigine. these compounds all contain the diphenyl structural motif, which is composed of two phenyl groups separated by a center-to-center distance of ⬃5 å and a stem-bond angle of
⬃110° (kuo et al., 2000) and probably serves as the major binding ligands
to a common anticonvulsant receptor site in the extracellular side of the
na⫹ channel (kuo, 1998a). the diphenyl motifs in imipramine and carbamazepine even have the same torsion angles and are thus essentially
the same in the three-dimensional structure. in contrast, the diphenyl
motifs in imipramine, diphenhydramine, and lamotrigine all have quite
different torsion angles (kuo et al., 2000). however, imipramine and
diphenhydramine both contain a similar tertiary amine chain, which is
not present in carbamazepine. b, na⫹ currents in control, 3 ␮m, or 10 ␮m
imipramine were recorded in a neuron. the cell was held at ⫺120 mv and
stepped to 0 mv for 17 ms every second. imipramine (3 and 10 ␮m)
produce only equivocal and mild inhibition of the na⫹ current, respectively. the same experiment was repeated in the same cell except that the
holding potential was changed to ⫺60 mv (right). the currents are much
smaller than those on the left but are scaled to the same size for better
comparison (note the difference in the vertical scale bars). in contrast to
the findings on the left, 3 to 10 ␮m imipramine here shows a remarkable
inhibitory effect on the na⫹ current. the dotted line indicates zero current level in both.

cell preparation. coronal slices of the whole brain were prepared from 7- to 14-day-old long-evans rats. the ca1 region was
dissected from the slices and cut into small chunks. after treatment
for 5–10 min in dissociation medium (82 mm na2so4, 30 mm k2so4,
3 mm mgcl2, 5 mm hepes, 0.001% phenol red indicator, and 0.5
mg/ml type xi trypsin, ph 7.4, 37°c), tissue chunks were transferred
to dissociation medium containing no trypsin but 1 mg/ml bovine
 xxxg124xxx  and 1 mg/ml type ii-s  xxxd207xxx  (sigma, st.
louis, mo). each time that cells were needed, two to three chunks
were picked and triturated to release single neurons.
whole-cell recording. the dissociated neurons were put in a
recording chamber containing tyrode’s solution (150 mm nacl, 4
mm kcl, 2 mm mgcl2, 2 mm cacl2, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4).
whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were obtained using pipettes
pulled from borosilicate micropipettes (od 1.55–1.60 mm; hilgenberg inc., malsfeld, germany), fire polished, and coated with sylgard
(dow-corning, midland, mi). the pipette resistance was 1 to 2 m⍀
when filled with the internal solution containing 75 mm cscl, 75
mm csf, 2.5 mm mgcl2, 5 mm hepes, 2.5 mm egta, ph adjusted
to 7.4 by csoh. seal was formed and the whole-cell configuration
obtained in tyrode’s solution. the cell was then lifted from the
bottom of the chamber and moved in front of an array of flow pipes
(microcapillary; hilgenberg inc., germany; content, 1 ␮l; length, 64
mm) emitting either control or drug-containing external recording
solutions. imipramine and diphenhydramine were dissolved in water, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  to make 100 mm stock solutions, which were then diluted into

kinetics in the development of or recovery from drug action
(e.g., matsubara et al., 1987; clarkson et al., 1988) and slowing of na⫹ channel repriming (from inactivation) without
slowing of recovery of the fast-inactivation gate itself (vedantham and cannon, 1999). it is thus unsettled whether the
receptor(s) for anticonvulsants and/or local anesthetics are
well developed in the open native na⫹ channel, whether the
receptor(s) continue to have significant conformational
changes after channel activation, and whether binding of
these drugs blocks ion permeation through the pore. besides,
we have noted that the drug binding kinetics may play an
important role in the use-dependent inhibitory effect, but it
remains obscure whether any structural feature of a drug
could be correlated with its binding kinetics.
in an attempt to clarify the foregoing points, we studied
the effect of imipramine and other related compounds on
neuronal na⫹ channels in detail. imipramine is a commonly
prescribed antidepressant that has been shown to inhibit
na⫹ currents and the inhibitory effect is stronger with
higher frequency of depolarizing pulses or more depolarized
holding potentials (ogata and narahashi, 1989; bolotina et
al., 1992; kuo et al., 2000). structurally, imipramine contains
a diphenyl motif and a tertiary amine chain. moreover, the
two phenyl groups in imipramine share essentially the same
three-dimensional arrangement with those in the dibenzazepine tricyclic motif in carbamazepine (fig. 1a). in this
study, we show that imipramine, carbamazepine, and diphenhydramine all block open na⫹ channels, and all have
different binding kinetics to the open and to the inactivated
channels. also, the dibenzazepine tricyclic motif probably
holds the two benzene rings in the most favorable conformation for drug binding to the anticonvulsant receptor, which is
formed during channel activation yet changes its conformation further in the subsequent gating process.

different inhibitory effect of imipramine on naⴙ
currents elicited from different holding potentials.
figure 1b shows the effect of imipramine on neuronal na⫹
currents. imipramine (3 ␮m) has barely any inhibitory effect
on the na⫹ current elicited from a holding potential of ⫺120
mv, and even 10 ␮m imipramine produces only slight inhibition. on the other hand, imipramine has much stronger
inhibitory effect on the na⫹ current elicited from more positive holding potentials such as ⫺60 mv, where 3 ␮m imipramine inhibits more than half of the current, and most of the
current is inhibited by 10 ␮m imipramine. it is evident that
the inhibitory effect of imipramine on the na⫹ current is very
much dependent on the holding potentials.
dual effect of imipramine on naⴙ currents at concentrations higher than 30 ␮m. the inhibitory effect of

imipramine on na⫹ currents elicited from different holding
potentials are plotted in fig. 2, where the data are fitted by
one-to-one binding curves. if one fits the whole set of data (1

channel. a, dose-response curves for inhibition of na⫹ currents by 1 to

the test pulse protocol is the same as that described in fig. 1. the peak
currents in the presence of imipramine are normalized to the peak current in control at each holding potential to give the relative currents,
which are plotted against the concentration of imipramine ([imipramine])
in a semilogarithmic scale. each data point represents the mean from
three to seven cells. the s.e.m. are in general smaller than 10 to 20% of
the means and are not shown. the lines are fits to each set of data based
on one-to-one binding reactions and are of the form: relative current ⫽

at holding potentials ⫺120, ⫺110, ⫺100, ⫺90, ⫺80, ⫺70, ⫺60, and ⫺50
mv, respectively. b, a closer examination of the fitting results in part a
reveals that the data points at each holding potential are not very well
described by the foregoing one-to-one binding curves. the data points of
100 and 300 ␮m imipramine tend to fall below the fits. three sets of data
at holding potentials ⫺120, ⫺90, and ⫺60 mv along with the fitting
curves in part a (solid lines) are replotted here for a better illustration of
this point. if one fits only the data points in low concentrations (1 to 30
␮m) of imipramine, the fitting curves could very well describe the data
(the dotted lines), yet the residual currents in 100 and 300 ␮m imipramine are even smaller than the predicted values by the dotted lines. the
kapp from the dotted lines are 130, 27.0, and 1.96 ␮m at holding potentials ⫺120, ⫺90, and ⫺60 mv, respectively. c, at each holding potential,
the kapp from different fitting ranges in parts a and b are plotted
together for comparison. the kapp generally becomes smaller as the
holding potential becomes more positive, so is the difference between kapp
from the two fitting ranges.

tyrode’s solution to attain the final concentrations desired. the final
concentration of  xxxd1896xxx  (0.3% or less) was not found to
have detectable effect on na⫹ currents. lamotrigine was a kind gift
from wellcome foundation (kent, england), and the other drugs
were purchased from sigma. currents were recorded at room temperature (⬃25°c) with an axoclamp 200a amplifier, filtered at 5 khz
with four-pole bessel filter, digitized at 50- to 200-␮s intervals, and
stored using a digidata-1200 analog/digital interface as well as the
pclamp software (axon instruments, union city, ca).
molecular biology. the plasmid pna200 encoding the rat brain
type iia (riia) na⫹ channel ␣ subunit was a kind gift from dr. alan
l. goldin (department of microbiology and molecular genetics, university of california, irvine, ca). the plasmid also provides the
xenopus laevis–␤-globulin untranslated sequence that improves expression of exogenous proteins in oocytes. the pna200 has unique
xhoi and noti restriction sites, between which is the coding region
containing another unique bglii site. to optimize the mutagenesis
process, we first divided the entire coding region into two subfragments (the xhoi-bglii and bglii-noti subfragments, each about 3⬃4
kb in size) and subcloned each subfragment into another small and
easily growing vector pbsta (also kindly provided by dr. a. l.
goldin). f1489q point mutation (west et al., 1992) was done with
the [bglii-noti]-pbsta plasmid dna template and polymerase
chain reaction-based method (quikchange mutagenesis kit; stratagene, la jolla, ca), and was verified by dna sequencing. the
mutation-containing subfragment from [bglii-noti]-pbsta plasmid
was then excised and transferred back into pna200 expression vector. dna sequencing was performed again at this moment and two
independent clones were tested to exclude effects of inadvertent
mutations. the full-length crna transcript was synthesized from
the pna200 containing the f1489q mutation using the t7 mmessage mmachine transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx). the
defolliculated x. laevis oocytes (stage v–vi) were then injected with
the crna transcript and maintained at 18°c for 1 to 7 days for
electrophysiological studies.
intracellular recording. macroscopic f1489q mutant na⫹ current was examined by two-microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings
in oocytes. during recording, the oocyte in the chamber was continuously perfused with nd-96 solution (96 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgcl2, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm hepes, ph 7.6) which did or did not
contain the aforementioned drugs. both voltage-sensing and currentpassing electrodes were filled with 3 m kcl and had resistance of 0.1
to 0.8 m⍀. membrane potential was controlled by a two-electrode
voltage-clamp amplifier with a virtual ground circuit (model oc725c; warner instrument, hamden, ct). currents were recorded at
room temperature (⬃25°c), filtered at 5 khz, digitized at 20- to
100-␮s intervals, and stored using a digidata-1200 analog/digital
interface as well as the pclamp software (axon instruments). all
statistics in this study are given as mean ⫾ s.e.m.

inhibition of naⴙ current by imipramine

scheme 1.

where r and i are the resting and inactivated states of the
channel, and rd and id are the imipramine-bound resting
and inactivated states, respectively. the activated (open)
state is omitted here because most activated na⫹ channels
would be quickly inactivated, and thus for a steady-state
condition one may just consider r and i states for simplicity.

according to this scheme, at a particular holding potential
the fraction of channels in state r (the channels that can be
activated, or therefore the current that could be elicited upon
membrane depolarization) would be reduced by imipramine

fig. 3. shift of the inactivation curve by imipramine. a, the cell was held
at ⫺120 mv and stepped every 15 s to the inactivating pulse (⫺120 to
⫺50 mv) for 9 s. the channels that remain available after each inactivating pulse were assessed by the peak currents during the following
short test pulse to 0 mv for 10 ms. the fraction available is defined as the
normalized peak current (relative to the current evoked with an inactivating pulse at ⫺120 mv) and is plotted against the voltage of the
inactivating pulse. two sets of control data were obtained before and
after the experiments in different concentrations of imipramine to demonstrate the absence of significant voltage drift during this long experiment. the lines are fits to each set of data of a boltzmann function:
fraction available ⫽ 1/(1 ⫹ exp[(v ⫺ vh)/k]), with vh values (in mv) of
⫺71.8, ⫺72.8, ⫺74.9, ⫺76.8, ⫺84.0, and ⫺91.2; and k values of 5.4, 5.5,
5.9, 5.9, 5.9, and 6.3 for control (before imipramine), control (after imipramine), 1, 3, 10, and 30 ␮m imipramine; respectively. b, shift of the
inactivation curve (⌬v) is determined in each cell by the difference
between vh in control and in the presence imipramine, and are 3.4 ⫾ 0.3,

concentration in each cell. the mean value of ⌬v/k in each drug concentration (n ⫽ 3 to 4) is used to calculate exp(⌬v/k), which is plotted against
imipramine concentration. the line is a fit to the data of the form:
exp(⌬v/k) ⫽ [1 ⫹ (d/1.2)]/[1 ⫹ (d/1000)], where d denotes imipramine
concentration in micromolar (see text for more details).

to 300 ␮m imipramine), na⫹ currents are inhibited by imipramine with an apparent dissociation constant (kapp) of ⬃68
␮m when the holding potential is ⫺120 mv. the kapp
steadily decreases with more positive holding potentials, and
becomes ⬃1.4 ␮m when the holding potential is ⫺50 mv (fig.
2a). however, a closer examination reveals that these fits do
not well describe the data. there is clearly a tendency for the
data points in 100 and 300 ␮m imipramine to fall below the
predicted values of the fitting lines. in fig. 2b, the one-to-one
binding curves are fitted only to the data points in low concentrations of imipramine. the new fits reasonably describe
the data points in 1 to 30 ␮m imipramine, supporting the
presumption of one-to-one binding, at least in this concentration range. deviation of the data points in 100 and 300 ␮m
imipramine from the predicted values is even more evident
with the new fits, except for the currents elicited from rather
positive holding potentials (⫺70 to ⫺50 mv) where there is
almost no residual na⫹ current in 100 and 300 ␮m imipramine anyway. figure 2c shows that the kapp at a holding
potential of ⫺120 mv is evidently different between the results in fig. 2, a and b (126 versus 68 ␮m), but the difference
gradually decreases with more positive holding potentials.
these findings suggest that the inhibition of na⫹ current by
imipramine could be explained with a one-to-one binding
process if the imipramine concentration is low (30 ␮m or
lower). however, an additional action of imipramine on the
na⫹ current becomes too manifest to be disregarded in
higher concentrations of the drug. the essential feature of
this additional inhibitory action is its concentration dependence, because it would produce significant effect only when
imipramine concentration is higher than 30 to 100 ␮m. the
kapp obtained in fig. 2b thus should be the better estimate of
the binding affinity of imipramine underlying the inhibitory
effect that is fully evident even in very low concentrations of
imipramine.
because most na⫹ channels would be in the inactivated
and resting states at holding potentials of ⫺50 mv and ⫺120
mv, respectively (see the control inactivation curves in fig.
3a below), the foregoing inhibitory effect, which is evident
even in low concentrations of imipramine, is most likely
caused by differential affinity of imipramine to the inactivated and the resting states of the na⫹ channel, just like the
cases of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine (kuo
and bean, 1994; kuo et al., 1997; kuo and lu, 1997). a more
quantitative treatment of the effect of selective binding of
imipramine to the inactivated state can be given with this
scheme:

imipramine inhibition of inactivation-deficient mutant riia naⴙ channels. we have seen that imipramine
has much higher affinity for inactivated channels than the
resting channels. considering that resting na⫹ channels are
quickly activated and then inactivated upon membrane depolarization, could the drug receptor be formed during channel activation? to test for this possibility, we examined the
effect of imipramine on inactivation-deficient (f1489q) mutant riia na⫹ channels. figure 6a shows that in the control
condition, the f1489q mutant na⫹ current initially decays
quickly (but only to a very small extent) and then quickly
enters another very slow decay phase. the two phases of
current decay presumably are ascribable to the residual fast
inactivation process and the slow inactivation process (which
is probably like the c-type inactivation in k⫹ channels; lawrence et al., 1996; nuss et al., 1996), respectively. imipramine (10 to 100 ␮m) apparently inhibits the mutant na⫹
current by dose-dependent acceleration of current decay. for
simplicity, we did not fit multiexponential function to describe the kinetics of current decay. instead, we left out the
first 9 ms and fit monoexponential function to the rest part of

fig. 4. unbinding rate of imipramine from na⫹ channels. a, in control or
in the continuous presence of 10 to 30 ␮m imipramine, the cell was held
at ⫺120 mv and then prepulsed to ⫺40 mv for 8 s. the cell was then
stepped back to a recovery gap potential at ⫺120 mv for variable length
before being stepped again to a short test pulse at 0 mv for 6 ms to assess
the available current. the pulse protocol was repeated every 15 s. the
time courses of recovery are obtained by plotting the peak current at the
test pulse against the length of the recovery gap potential. with very long
(⬃4 s) recovery gap potential, the currents in 10 to 30 ␮m imipramine
recover to their steady-state block level at ⫺120 mv, and thus are still
smaller than the current at that time point in control. b, data in the first
500 ms of recovery gap are redrawn with a smaller horizontal scale to
demonstrate that after short (e.g., 5–10 ms) recovery period, the currents
in control have largely recovered, but most currents in imipramine have
not.

with a kapp defined by (bean, 1984; kuo and bean, 1994):
kapp ⫽ 1/[h/kr ⫹ (1 ⫺ h)/ki], where h is the fraction of
channels in state r in the absence of drug (“fraction available” in the control condition of fig. 3a), and kr and ki are
the dissociation constants for the resting and inactivated
channels, respectively. this is as if the overall affinity of
imipramine to the channel (⬃1/kapp) is a weighted average of
the affinity toward each state of the channel [h/kr ⫹ (1 ⫺
h)/ki]. according to this equation and a kapp of ⬃1.4 ␮m at
⫺50 mv, where h is ⬃0.05 (fig. 3a), ki should be ⬃1.3 ␮m.
with a ki of ⬃1.3 ␮m and a kapp of ⬃130 ␮m at ⫺120 mv
where h is close to 1 (fig. 3a), kr must be somewhat larger
than 130 ␮m. in other words, ki and kr must differ by at
least 100-fold.
measurement of the affinity between inactivated
naⴙ channels and imipramine by shift of the inactivation curve. one may also estimate ki with another approach based on the foregoing scheme. in the control condition, the inactivation curve can be approximated by a
boltzmann distribution, 1/(1 ⫹ exp[(v ⫺ vh)/k]) (fig. 3a),
where v is the membrane potential, vh is the half-inactivated
potential (at which half of the channels are in state r and the
other half are in state i), and k is the slope factor. when
imipramine is added, the shape of the curve should remain
the same, but the midpoint (vh) would be shifted by ⌬v,
which is related to ki and kr by equating exp(⌬v/k) with [1
⫹ (d/ki)]/[1 ⫹ (d/kr)], where d is the concentration of imipramine (bean et al., 1983; bean, 1984). figure 3, a and b,
show that with 1 to 30 ␮m imipramine added, the inactivation curves indeed are shifted leftward with unchanged slope.
figure 3c shows the mean exp(⌬v/k) values in various concentrations of imipramine and a fit with the foregoing equation, revealing a ki of 1.2 ␮m if kr is assumed to be 1000 ␮m.
if kr is assumed to be 100 and 10,000 ␮m, ki would be 1 and
1.2 ␮m, respectively. this is quite consistent with the ki
value (⬃1.3 ␮m) obtained from a totally different approach in
fig. 2
binding rate of imipramine onto the inactivated
naⴙ channel. we also explored the kinetics of interaction
between imipramine and the inactivated na⫹ channels. figure 4 shows that after a few milliseconds at a recovery gap
potential, the majority of normal inactivated channels recover, whereas most imipramine-bound channels do not. because imipramine-bound inactivated channels recover much
more slowly than “normal” inactivated channels, one may
assess the binding rate of imipramine onto inactivated na⫹
channels by another voltage protocol, in which the prepulse
is gradually lengthened while the ⫺120 mv gap is fixed at 5
ms (fig. 5a). the decrease of na⫹ currents elicited during
the test pulse subsequent to the ⫺120 mv gap now mostly
reflects the increase of drug-bound inactivated channels,
with a little contamination from the concomitant increase
of normal inactivated channels that have not recovered
during the 5-ms gap. the contamination is corrected by
taking the difference between the na⫹ current in control
and that in the presence of imipramine (fig. 5b). figure
5c shows that the macroscopic binding rates increase linearly with drug concentration, supporting the presumption
in fig. 2 that low concentrations of imipramine interacts
with na⫹ channels via a one-to-one binding process (simple bimolecular reaction). the linear regression fit to the
data reveals a binding rate constant of 1.5 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1.

current may underestimate the kinetics of imipramine binding, but this approach gives reasonable fits to the current and
should be valid enough for further discussion (see below).

prepulse, there is a recovery gap potential at ⫺120 mv for 5 ms to recover
normal (not imipramine-bound) inactivated na⫹ channels, and then the

ms every 10 s. decay of the current has a rapid initial phase and a subsequent slow phase, and 10 to 100 ␮m imipramine obviously accelerates both
phases in a dose-dependent fashion. to simplify the analysis, we try to
describe only the more sustained component (9th to 200th ms) of the currents with monoexponential functions (the thick dotted lines), which seem to
give reasonable fits to this part of the data. the thin dotted line indicates the
zero current level. b, the mean value of the inverses of time constants from
the fits in part a (n ⫽ 3 to 5) are plotted against the concentration of
imipramine. the solid line is a linear regression fit to the data in 0 to 100 ␮m
imipramine. the intercept and slope are 9.7 s⫺1 and 2.3 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1,
respectively. this fit, however, does not seem to be optimal. it may be better
to describe the first three data points in 0 to 30 ␮m imipramine by another
linear regression (the dotted line, slope 4.0 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1), with the point in
100 ␮m imipramine falling below the trend formed by the first three points.
this is reminiscent of the case of imipramine block of open a type k⫹
channels (kuo, 1998b), suggesting that the macroscopic binding rate of 100
␮m imipramine to the open na⫹ channel is no longer much slower than the
channel activation rate in the oocyte preparation, and thus may serve as a
collateral evidence arguing for open na⫹ channel block by imipramine. c,
two simplified gating schemes for the discussion of imipramine action on the
wild-type (top) and mutant na⫹ channels (bottom). c, o, i, od, and id stand
for the closed (resting or deactivated), open (activated), inactivated, openimipramine bound, and inactivated-imipramine bound states, respectively.
⫹v (depolarization) and ⫺v (hyperpolarization) facilitate channel activation
and deactivation, respectively. in the wild-type channels the o-to-i rate is
very fast, yet the i-to-o rate is much slower, making steady-state distribution of the channel mostly in the inactivated state. imipramine binds to the
inactivated state with a binding rate linearly correlated with the drug
concentration ([d]) and a slow unbinding rate. the binding of imipramine to
the open wild-type channels is uncertain at this point (the dotted arrows
between state o and od in the upper). in the mutant channels the i-to-o
rate presumably increases a lot, resulting in the aforementioned two phases
of current decay. because the data from mutant channel indicate substantial
and even faster binding rate to the open channels of imipramine than to the
inactivated channels, the arrows between states o and od in the lower are
drawn with solid lines, and the arrow from o to od is made larger than that
from i to id (see text for more detail).

in the presence of imipramine) is linearly correlated with
imipramine concentration, giving a macroscopic binding rate
constant of 1.1 ⫻ 107 m⫺1s⫺1. this value is apparently faster
than that from the mutant channels expressed in oocytes (2.4
to 4.0 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1), chiefly because the latter is probably
an underestimate. because the na⫹ channel in native hippocampal neurons shows rapid and almost complete inactivation, the i-to-o rate should be very much slower than the
o-to-i rate (which is essentially the absolute determinant of
the decaying speed of the macroscopic currents; fig. 6c, top).
it is unlikely that further decrease of the already very slow
i-to-o rate by absorption of channels to state id would make
the dose-dependent acceleration of current decay by imipra-

to the channel pore, leading to a much faster transition rate
from state i to state o in the mutant than in the wild-type
channels (fig. 6c). under such circumstances, even if imipramine did not bind to and block open na⫹ channel, it could
still accelerate current decay by stabilizing channels in the
id state and thus effectively decreasing chances (speed) of
the i-to-o transition. however, we have noted that in the
mutant channel the i-to-o rate is much faster than o-to-i
rate, which is already ⬃1500 s⫺1 (the inverse of the time
constant of macroscopic current decay in wild-type channels).
the very fast o-to-i and i-to-o rates thus should make a
rapid “equilibrium” of the channel protein between states o
and i from the viewpoint of the relatively much slower imipramine binding process. because this rapid “equilibrium”
between states o and i very much favors state o, the apparent imipramine binding rate here should be much slower
than the i to id rate documented in fig. 5 if imipramine
could only bind to the inactivated state. this is inconsistent
with the experimental finding of 2.3 to 4.0 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1,
which is probably an underestimate, because we have left out
the rapid initial rapid decay phase in fitting, yet it is already
faster or at least not much slower than the binding rate to the
inactivated state (1.5 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1, fig. 5). imipramine thus
is unlikely to speed the decay of macroscopic na⫹ currents by
selective binding to only the inactivated channels. instead,
imipramine seems to bind to the open channel and block the
pore, most likely with an even faster binding rate than that
to the inactivated channels. the fact that imipramine significantly binds to and blocks the mutant channel would also
suggest that formation of the imipramine binding site is not
directly related to binding of the inactivating hinged-lid to
the na⫹ channel pore (vedantham and cannon, 1999).
imipramine binding to open naⴙ channels with
very fast kinetics. in fig. 2, we have noted that in addition to selective binding to and thus stabilizing the inactivated na⫹ channels, there is another inhibitory effect that
becomes manifest with high concentrations (⬎ 30 ␮m) of
imipramine. in view of the findings in fig. 6, the additional
inhibitory effect of high concentrations of imipramine in fig.
2 might be related to open channel block. this blocking effect
may significantly affect the amplitude and kinetics of the
macroscopic current only when the concentration of imipramine is high enough, because the very rapid and complete
inactivation in native na⫹ channels would require a fast
macroscopic binding (and thus blocking) rate of imipramine
to produce discernible changes in the na⫹ current (see below). to explore such a possibility, we carefully examined the
kinetics of na⫹ current decay in the presence of imipramine.
the gradual decrease of peak na⫹ currents in fig. 7a demonstrates use-dependent block, indicating gradual increase of
unavailable channels (gradual stabilization of the na⫹ channels to the inactivated state) by 100 ␮m imipramine in the
first few pulses repeated at a frequency of 1 hz. in contrast
to the gradual change of the peak current, the kinetics of the
current decay changes abruptly. as soon as the cell is moved
from the control solution into the external solution containing 100 ␮m imipramine, the kinetics of the macroscopic current decay are immediately accelerated to the same extent in
all sweeps (fig. 7b). there is also a tendency for the current
peak to appear earlier in imipramine. figure 7c further
shows that the acceleration of current decay (the difference
between the rates of macroscopic current decay in control and

fig. 7. binding rate of imipramine onto the open na⫹ channel. a, na⫹
currents in control or 100 ␮m imipramine were recorded in a neuron. the
cell was held at ⫺120 mv and stepped to ⫹10 mv for 7 ms every second.
after the change of external solution from control to 100 ␮m imipramine,
peak of the na⫹ current gradually decreases within a few sweeps to reach
a steady-state level. b, the na⫹ currents in 100 ␮m imipramine in part a
are scaled up so that every current sweep has the same peak as that of the
control current. it is evident that the kinetics of current decay does not
change gradually, but is accelerated to the same extent in all sweeps in
100 ␮m imipramine. also note that the current peak tends to appear
slightly earlier in imipramine. c, decay of the macroscopic na⫹ currents
in control and in 30 to 300 ␮m imipramine is fitted with monoexponential
functions. in each cell, the inverse of the time constant in control is
subtracted from the inverse of the time constant in the presence of drug
to give the macroscopic binding rate of imipramine to the open na⫹
channels (n ⫽ 3 to 6). the macroscopic binding rate is then plotted
against the concentration of imipramine. the line is the linear regression
fit with a slope of 1.1 ⫻ 107 m⫺1s⫺1.

mine in fig. 7. thus the linear correlation between the acceleration of decaying kinetics and imipramine concentration, along with the slightly earlier peak in imipramine than
in control, would strongly argue that imipramine blocks the
open na⫹ channel pore with a one-to-one binding process,
exactly analogous to imipramine binding to the inactivated
channels. however, in native hippocampal neurons, imipramine binding to the open na⫹ channel (fig. 7c) is evidently
⬃70-fold faster than its binding to the inactivated channel
(fig. 5c).
block of open naⴙ channels by carbamazepine and
diphenhydramine. similar to imipramine, high concentrations of carbamazepine and diphenhydramine also accelerate
the kinetics of macroscopic na⫹ current decay (fig. 8, a and
b). figure 8c further shows that the acceleration of macroscopic current decay is linearly correlated with carbamazepine and diphenhydramine concentration, giving binding
rate constants of 1.1 ⫻ 106 and 8.3 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1 for carbamazepine and diphenhydramine, respectively. these rates
are again significantly faster than the previously reported
binding rates of carbamazepine and diphenhydramine onto
the inactivated na⫹ channels (kuo et al., 1997, 2000). in
contrast, the kinetics of current decay are not definitely accelerated in 100 to 300 ␮m lamotrigine. because the na⫹
current generally decays with a speed of ⬃1500 s⫺1 due to
fast inactivation, the macroscopic binding rate of a poreblocking drug probably should be at least 150 s⫺1 (a binding
rate constant of 5 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1 for 300 ␮m drug) to make
discernible acceleration of the current decay on top of the fast
inactivation. the binding rate constant of lamotrigine onto
the inactivated na⫹ channel is only ⬃10,000 m⫺1s⫺1 (kuo
and lu, 1997). it seems that binding of lamotrigine onto the
open na⫹ channel is not as fast as 5 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1 (⬃50
times faster than its binding onto the inactivated channel);
consequently, no definite changes in the kinetics of the na⫹
current decay in 100 to 300 ␮m lamotrigine.

discussion
imipramine as an inactivation stabilizer: the accessory role of the tertiary amine chain. in this study,
we demonstrate that imipramine binds to the inactivated
neuronal na⫹ channels with a dissociation constant of ⬃1.3
␮m, whereas the affinity between imipramine and the resting channels is at least 100 times lower (figs. 2 and 3).
imipramine is thus similar to anticonvulsants phenytoin,
carbamazepine, and lamotrigine in selective binding to the
inactivated channels (kuo and bean, 1994; kuo et al., 1997;
kuo and lu, 1997). given a one-to-one binding process, a
binding rate of 1.5 ⫻ 105 m⫺1s⫺1 (fig. 5), and a dissociation
constant of 1.3 ␮m, imipramine should unbind from the
inactivated na⫹ channels at a rate of ⬃0.19 s⫺1. in the same
preparation, the unbinding rate of carbamazepine is ⬃0.95
s⫺1 (calculated from a binding rate of ⬃3.8 ⫻ 104 m⫺1s⫺1 and
a dissociation constant of ⬃25 ␮m to the inactivated na⫹
channels; kuo et al., 1997). the ⬃20-fold difference in overall
binding affinity indicates a difference of ⬃3 rt (⬃1.8 kcal/
mol; r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature)
in the total binding energy between the two drugs. because
imipramine and carbamazepine share the same three-dimensional structure in the diphenyl motif (fig. 1a), the tertiary
amine chain present in imipramine but not in carbamazepine

fig. 8. binding rates of carbamazepine and diphenhydramine onto the

and 300 ␮m diphenhydramine were recorded in the same neuron. the
pulse protocol is the same as that in fig. 7a. b, the same currents in part
a are scaled to the same peak amplitude to demonstrate acceleration of
current decay by carbamazepine and diphenhydramine. c, for 100 to 300
␮m carbamazepine, diphenhydramine, and lamotrigine, the macroscopic
binding rate is obtained by the same approach as that described in fig.
7c, and then is plotted against the drug concentration (n ⫽ 4 to 9). the
lines are linear regression fits with slopes of 1.1 ⫻ 106 m⫺1s⫺1 and 8.3 ⫻
105 m⫺1s⫺1 for carbamazepine and diphenhydramine, respectively. the
macroscopic binding rate of 100 to 300 ␮m lamotrigine is not significantly
different from the zero point, indicating insignificant change of the decaying kinetics of na⫹ current in the presence of 100 to 300 ␮m lamotrigine.

channel blocker but not an inactivation stabilizer in a-type
k⫹ channels (kuo, 1998b). this could suggest subtle yet
significant difference in the gating conformational changes in
the external pore mouth of k⫹ and na⫹ channels.
continual gating conformational changes in the
anticonvulsant receptor. upon depolarization, na⫹
channels undergo a series of conformational changes leading
to channel opening (activation) and inactivation. although
not necessarily so, inactivation tends to happen after activation (and thus we have the simplified c-o-i scheme in fig.
6c). if imipramine and carbamazepine are open channel
blockers, the anticonvulsant receptor should be formed during channel activation (the c-to-o step in fig. 6c). because
the channel cannot be simultaneously occupied by two anticonvulsant molecules (kuo, 1998a), presumably there is only
one anticonvulsant receptor in the channel. thus there
should be additional conformational changes affecting either
the receptor or the access to the receptor during inactivation
to account for the ⬃70-fold slower binding rates of imipramine to the inactivated than to the open na⫹ channels (figs.
5 and 7; for simplicity, we will assume changes in the receptor in the following discussion, but similar or slightly modified arguments may apply to changes in the access to the
receptor). the slow drug binding rate to the inactivated na⫹
channel, one of the key attributes leading to the “use-dependent” block of na⫹ current, thus is not a fixed feature but is
achieved by further modification of a well-developed receptor. in comparison with the ⬃70-fold difference between the
binding rates onto the open and the inactivated channels for
imipramine (figs. 5 and 7), the difference is ⬃30-fold for
carbamazepine (1.1 ⫻ 106 versus 4 ⫻ 104 m⫺1s⫺1, fig. 8; kuo
et al., 1997), yet is only ⬃10-fold for diphenhydramine (8.2 ⫻
105 versus 7.2 ⫻ 104 m⫺1s⫺1, fig. 8; kuo et al., 2000). the
difference thus is more similar between carbamazepine and
imipramine than between diphenhydramine and imipramine, suggesting that the conformational changes in the
receptor site during channel inactivation probably involve
the binding ligands for the diphenyl motif more than those
for the amine chain. along with the stronger inhibitory effect
of the drugs with tertiary amine chain (than the drugs with
only the diphenyl motif) on resting channels (kuo et al.,
2000), it seems plausible that the binding ligands for the
amine chain do not have conformational changes as dramatic
as the ligands for the diphenyl motif during the whole gating
process of the channel. the structure of the diphenyl motif in
diphenhydramine is different from that in imipramine and
carbamazepine chiefly in the torsion angles (⬃⫺60° and
⬃⫺70° versus ⬃⫺60° and ⬃⫹50 to ⫹60°, kuo et al., 2000). it
is surprising that the torsion angle, which is usually a quite
freely movable parameter, should have such a significant
effect on drug-binding kinetics. this would suggest delicate
geometric requirement of the binding counterparts for effective collision. if the binding ligands of the planar phenyl
groups are also planar phenyl groups (to allow close proximity between the binding counterparts), then the torsion angles of the binding ligands in the receptor (presumably aromatic side chains of the amino acids in the channel peptide)
are probably more “fixed” than those in single free-moving
amino acids. during na⫹ channel activation, these aromatic
ligands are oriented to make an effective binding site for the
diphenyl motif in the dibenzazepine tricyclic structure of
carbamazepine and imipramine and are further reoriented

probably is responsible for the ⬃3 rt difference in binding
energy. if one assumes negligible contribution to the binding
energy by the short amide group in carbamazepine and a
total binding energy of 13.6 rt (dissociation constant, ⬃1.3
␮m) for imipramine binding to the inactivated na⫹ channel,
then probably ⬃22% (3/13.6) of the total binding energy of
imipramine is contributed by the tertiary amine chain, and
the major part (⬃78%) of binding energy is from the diphenyl
motif. because 1.8 kcal/mol is much smaller than the usual
strength of ionic bonds (5 to 10 kcal/mol), this tertiary amine
chain probably interacts with the channel protein by the
other binding forces such as hydrogen bond, ion-dipole, or
hydrophobic interactions (zimmerman and feldman, 1989).
this is consistent with the findings that the potency of nalkanols in blocking na⫹ channels is related to not only
phenyl substitution, but also intrinsic molar volume, hydrogen bond acceptor basicity as well as donor acidity, and the
polarity of the alkanols (kondratiev and hahin, 2001). according to the foregoing kinetic analysis, the overall ⬃20-fold
difference in the binding affinity between imipramine and
carbamazepine can be divided into a 5-fold difference in the
unbinding rate and a 4-fold difference in the binding rate.
the tertiary amine chain thus seems to increase the probability of effective collision (between the free drug molecule
and the vacant receptor) and the binding strength (between
the bound drug molecule and the occupied receptor) of imipramine roughly equally.
imipramine as an open channel blocker: blocking
the external pore mouth by the diphenyl motif. in
addition to stabilizing inactivation, imipramine also inhibits
the inactivation-deficient mutant na⫹ channels expressed in
oocytes (fig. 6). this is consistent with previous findings that
phenytoin would inhibit na⫹ currents when fast inactivation
was removed by enzymes (schauf et al., 1976; quandt, 1988).
in figs. 7 and 8, we further demonstrate dose-dependent
acceleration of current decay by imipramine, carbamazepine,
and diphenhydramine in native channels, indicating the role
of these drugs as open na⫹ channel blockers and the location
of the drug receptor in or near the pore. because carbamazepine could also block the open na⫹ channel, imipramine
probably blocks ion conduction chiefly with the diphenyl motif rather than the tertiary amine chain. in this regard, it is
interesting to note that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine probably bind to the same anticonvulsant receptor
on the external side of the channel with the common diphenyl
structural motif (kuo, 1998a), although an internally located
local anesthetic receptor that overlaps with the anticonvulsant receptor has also been proposed (see ragsdale et al.,
1994, 1996; yarov-yarovoy et al., 2001; but also see li et al.,
1999). finally, because of its size (⬃10 å in diameter), imipramine is unlikely to plug deeply into the pore. these arguments altogether might locate the anticonvulsant receptor to
the relatively wide external pore mouth of the na⫹ channel,
with pore-blocking effect produced chiefly by binding of the
phenyl groups of the drugs. gating conformational changes
involving this area and causing different drug affinity are
plausible, as it has been shown that externally located mutations or conformational changes could have an effect on
na⫹ channel inactivation (chahine et al., 1994; yang and
horn, 1995; ji et al., 1996), and a mutation in the external
pore loop may alter na⫹ channel activation and deactivation
(tomaselli et al., 1995). also, imipramine is an external open

by subsequent gating conformational changes that lead to
inactivation. the diphenyl motif seems to change chiefly in
the torsion angles during this reorientation and becomes
quite less favorable for the binding of imipramine and carbamazepine (but not so much for the binding of diphenhydramine whose two aromatic groups are oriented differently
from those in the dibenzazepine tricyclic structure).
pharmacological and therapeutic implications. the
therapeutic plasma concentrations of imipramine and diphenhydramine is usually 0.1 to 1 ␮m. however, the free
drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid probably is no
more than ⬃0.1 ␮m because of ⬃90% plasma protein binding
of the drugs (carruthers et al., 1978; amsterdam et al., 1980;
benet et al., 1996). this concentration is too low to have a
significant effect on the na⫹ channels according to the data
from this study. on the other hand, we have argued that
carbamazepine could be more effective in suppressing short
ictal depolarization than phenytoin because of its faster binding rate to the inactivated na⫹ channels (kuo et al., 1997).
with the even faster ⬃30-fold binding rate to the open na⫹
channel, carbamazepine may have an overall use-dependent
inhibitory effect on the cellular discharges happening even
faster than we previously imagined. this would be especially
true in the cases whose ictal activities are characterized by
only periodic bursts of discharges but not vivid sustained
depolarization to keep the na⫹ channels in the inactivated
state, such as typical absence seizures. although carbamazepine is not a drug of choice, in quite a few earlier reports
some patients with absence seizures do respond satisfactorily
to carbamazepine (schain et al., 1977; familusi, 1985). such
a therapeutic effect is difficult to envisage if one considers
only binding to the inactivated channels. it is plausible that
binding to and blocking the open neuronal na⫹ channel may
play a role in the clinical effect of carbamazepine.
