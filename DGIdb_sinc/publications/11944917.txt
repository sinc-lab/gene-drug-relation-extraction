s100 proteins are a multigenic family of low-molecular-weight ca 2ⴙ-binding proteins comprising 19 members. these proteins undergo a conformational change
by ca 2ⴙ-binding and consequently interact with their
target proteins. recently, we reported that two antiallergic drugs,  xxxd157xxx  and  xxxd1763xxx , bind to
 xxxg2003xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  of the s100 protein family. in the
present study, we used a newly developed antiallergic
drug, olopatadine, as a ligand for affinity chromatography and examined binding specificity of the drug to
s100 protein family. olopatadine binds specifically to
s100 proteins, such as s100a1,  xxxg2007xxx , s100l,  xxxg2003xxx ,
and  xxxg2004xxx , in a ca 2ⴙ-dependent manner but not to
calmodulin. mutagenesis study showed that amino
acid residues 76 – 85 in s100a1 are necessary for its
binding to olopatadine. in contrast, residues 89 –94
were identified as an  xxxd157xxx -binding site in s100a1.
moreover, olopatadine did not competitively inhibit
s100a1-binding site of  xxxd157xxx . furthermore, we
showed that olopatadine inhibited the binding of
s100a1 target protein’s binding site peptides to s100a1.
these results indicate that c-terminal region of s100a1
is important for antiallergic drug binding, although
the drug binding sites are different according to each
antiallergic drug. differences in the binding sites of
s100a1 to antiallergic drugs suggest that the regulatory functions of s100 proteins may exist in several
regions. therefore, these drugs may serve as useful
tools for evaluating the physiological significance of
s100 protein family. © 2002 elsevier science (usa)

s100 proteins. these proteins exhibit a general structural principle of so called ef-hand structure. by ca 2⫹binding, these proteins undergo a conformational change
and consequently interact with their target proteins.
of the ca 2⫹-binding proteins, s100 was first considered
to exist mainly in the nervous system, but later new
members of s100 protein family were identified in various tissues (reviewed in 1).
many proteins are known to bind to s100a1. in a few
cases, s100a1-binding sites on its target proteins have
been identified (reviewed in 1). the c-terminal extension of s100a1 has been shown to be important for the
binding of a synthetic peptide, trtk12, derived from a
sequence found in the ␣-subunit of the actin capping
protein, capz, an s100a1-binding protein, suggesting
that the c-terminal extension of s100a1 may be implicated in the recognition of capz (2). the giant
myosin-associated twitchin kinase is activated by
s100a1 in a ca 2⫹-dependent and zn 2⫹-enhanced manner (3). the s100a1-binding site on twitchin kinase
has also been identified and s100a1 c-terminal extension plays a major role in this interaction (4). s100a1
also stimulates ndr, a nuclear serine/threonine protein
kinase important in the regulation of cell division and
cell morphology, in ca 2⫹-dependent manner (5).  xxxg2007xxx 
binding to ndr can be inhibited by a synthetic peptide
derived from ndr. the protein kinase activity of ndr is
regulated by the second messenger ca 2⫹, and this regulation is brought about through ca 2⫹-dependent interaction of ndr with s100a1 and  xxxg2007xxx .
we previously reported that calmodulin antagonists
such as w-7 ( xxxd1323xxx ) (6), w-77 ((s)-p-(2-aminoethyloxy)-n-[2(4-benzyloxycarbonylpiperazinyl)-1-(p-methoxybenzyl)ethyl]-n-methylbenzene-sulfonamide dihydrochloride)
(7) and w-66 (n-(2-aminoethyl)-n-[2-(4-chlorocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide) (8) bound

ability of antagonists, which solely interact with s100
proteins, should permit understanding of the physiological role of this protein family in cellular responses.
recently, we have reported that antiallergic drugs
such as  xxxd157xxx ,  xxxd1763xxx , and  xxxd3411xxx  specifically bind to  xxxg2003xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  of the s100 protein
family, except calmodulin (9, 10).
in the present study, we have used a newly developed antiallergic drug, olopatadine, as well as  xxxd157xxx  and  xxxd1763xxx , as ligand for affinity chromatography, and examined specific binding of these drugs to
s100 protein family. furthermore, the specificity and
binding sites of these antiallergic drugs were identified
and compared with those of a calmodulin-antagonist
fluphenazine, and to phenyl-sepharose.
materials and methods
materials. olopatadine (kw-4679)](z)-11-[(3-dimethylamino) propylidene]-6,11-dihydrodibenz [b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid hydrochloride]
was a generous gift from kyowa hakko kogyo co.  xxxd157xxx  (2amino-7-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-5h-[1]benzopyrano(2,3-b)pyridine-3carboxylic acid) from takeda pharmaceutical co.  xxxd1763xxx  (5,5⬘-[(2hydroxy-1,3-propanediyl) bis(oxy)] bis[4-oxo-4h-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid] disodium salt) and fluphenazine were purchased from
sigma co. chemical structures of the antiallergic drugs are presented in fig. 1. phenyl–sepharose 6f, eah–sepharose 4b, epoxyactivated sepharose 6b, nhs-activated sepharose 4 fast flow and
q-sepharose hp were purchased from amersham pharmacia biotech ltd.
coupling of the ligands to matrices for drug-affinity chromatography and s100a1 target protein’s binding site peptides. the coupling
of olopatadine,  xxxd157xxx , and  xxxd1763xxx  to eah–sepharose 4b
resin was carried out as described previously (10). briefly, the drugs
(0.5 mmol) dissolved in 1 ml of n,n⬘-dimethylformamide were added
to the eah–sepharose (7 ml, 5 g of wet mass), and n-ethyl-n⬘-(3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (edc; 0.5 g) suspended in 10 ml of n,n⬘-dimethylformamide was added to the mixture. after adjusting the ph to 5.0, the mixture was incubated with
gentle shaking for 48 h at 25°c. fluphenazine (0.5 mmol) was coupled to epoxy-activated sepharose 6b (5 g of wet mass) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
s100a1 target protein’s binding site peptides, trtk12, derived
from a sequence found in the ␣-subunit of the actin capping protein,
capz, 265trtkidwnkils276 (11), the giant myosin-associated twitchin
kinase, 323srynkirqkikekyadw339 (4) and a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase ndr, 62krlrrsaharketefltlkrtrlgl 86
(5), were synthesized with peptide synthesizer synergy 432a
(applied biosystems). resulting peptides (5 mg) were coupled to
nhs-activated sepharose (1 g of wet mass) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
protein sequencing. protein samples were subjected to 12%
tricine/sds/page (12) and transferred to pvdf membranes. after
staining with ponceau s (13), the protein bands were cut out and
digested with lysylendopeptidase (14). after overnight incubation at
37°c, the proteolytic fragments were separated by hplc (model
lc10a, shimadzu) with a c18 reversed-phase column (tosoh tskgel ods-80, 4.6 ⫻ 25 cm) with a linear gradient from 0 to 80% (v/v)
acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at flow
rate of 1 ml/min. the amino acid sequence of each proteolytic fragment was determined with automated protein sequencers (model
476a, applied biosystems or model ppsq-21, shimadzu).
antibody production and western blot analyses. as primary
antibodies, polyclonal anti- xxxg2003xxx  and anti- xxxg2004xxx  antibodies

were generated by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant
 xxxg2003xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx , respectively. these antibodies did not crossreact with ten other s100 proteins or other ef-hand proteins tested
(data not shown). anti-s100l antibody was obtained from transduction laboratories. for western blotting, the antibodies were used at
1:100 dilution. for the second antibody, either peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg or anti-rabbit igg (amersham pharmacia
biotech ltd.) was used at a dilution of 1:200. antigen–antibody
complexes were visualized by reacting the bound peroxidase with
diaminobenzidine and  xxxd2298xxx .
construction and purification of s100a1 mutants. mutations
were induced by pcr using as template rat s100a1 cdna cloned
into the pqe-60 vector (kindly provided by dr. j. heierhorst, st
vincent’s institute of medical research, australia). the oligonucleotides employed as pcr primers installed a ndei restriction enzyme
site 5⬘ to the atg start codon (sense primer) and different stop
codons and an adjacent bamhi restriction enzyme site at the 3⬘ end
of the cdna (antisense primers). the sequences of the different pcr
primers used to induce the mutations indicated were as follows:
sense primer, 5⬘-catatgggctctgagctggagaccgccatg-3⬘; and antisense
primers (1– 88), 5⬘-ggatcctcagttgttacaagcacatgtgag-3⬘; (1– 85). 5⬘-ggattctcaagccactgtgagagcagccac-3⬘; (1–75), 5⬘-ggatcctcaaaactcctggaagtccacttc-3⬘. the pcr products were gel-purified, and cloned into
pt7blue t-vector (novagen). the nucleotide sequence of each mutant
was confirmed by automated sequencing using applied biosystems 377
dna sequencer. a ndei–bamhi fragment of all mutant cdnas was
ligated into the same restriction enzyme site of pet-11a (stratagene)
and then the plasmid was introduced into e. coli bl21 (de3).
e. coli cells expressing wild type s100a1 (xl1blue cells) or mutant
s100a1 proteins (bl21 (de3) cells) were grown at 37°c overnight in
500 ml of lb medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm
iptg. cells were collected by centrifugation (30 min at 6000g, 4°c).
the bacterial pellet was resuspended in te buffer (10 mm tris–hcl,
ph 8.0, 1 mm edta). after sonification using branson sonifier (set
3, 4 ⫻ 30 s), the suspension was boiled for 10 min. after centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min, the supernatant was applied to
q-sepharose hp column (2.5 ⫻ 20 cm) preequilibrated with 20 mm
tris–hcl, ph 7.5. after the column was washed with 20 mm tris–
hcl/0.3 m nacl, ph 7.5, the proteins were eluted with a linear
gradient from 0.3 to 0.85 m nacl. as judged by sds/page, this
method yielded s100 proteins with more than 95% purity.
analytical binding experiments of s100a1 wild type and mutants
to olopatadine–,  xxxd157xxx –, fluphenazine–sepharose, and phenyl–
sepharose. the batchwise binding experiments of s100 proteins to
drug derivatized sepharose beads and phenyl-sepharose were performed as described by osterloh et al. (15).
non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (16). running buffer
containing 5 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 and 5 mm edta were used to generate the
ca 2⫹-bound and the apo-proteins, respectively.
dimer formation and cross-linking of s100a1 and s100a1 mutants. purified wild type s100a1 and s100a1 mutant proteins were
preincubated at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm hepes, ph
7.0, in the presence of 1 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 or 1 mm egta for 20 min at 25°c.
subsequently, aliquots were incubated with 5 mm bs 3 cross-linker
(pierce) for 30 min at 25°c. reactions were quenched by adding tris
to a final concentration of 50 mm. proteins were visualized by 12%
tricine/sds/page.
competition experiments of olopatadine and  xxxd157xxx  on the
s100a1 binding. recombinant s100a1 protein (25 ␮g) was incubated with 50 ␮l of  xxxd157xxx –sepharose or olopatadine–sepharose in 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.6 in the presence of 5 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 with
 xxxd157xxx  or olopatadine. after extensive washing in a buffer
containing 5 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2, the bound proteins were eluted by sds
sample buffer. the individual fractions (5 ␮l) were then subjected to
sds/page.

results and discussion
comparison of ca 2⫹-dependent olopatadine-binding
proteins with other antiallergic drugs and the
calmodulin antagonist-binding proteins
bovine brain, heart, and lung extracts were applied
to olopatadine-coupled sepharose columns in 20 mm
tris–hcl containing 0.2 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2, ph 7.5. after extensive washes, binding proteins to the columns were
eluted by the addition of 2 mm egta containing buffer
to chelate ca 2⫹. when the egta eluate from bovine
brain was subjected to sds/page, we obtained five
major different proteins with molecular masses of 55–
56, ⬃32, ⬃23, ⬃17 and ⬃10 kda. to determine the
partial amino acid sequences of each protein, lysylendopeptidase was used for digestion of the pvdf-blotted
proteins and then digested peptides were separated by
reversed-phase hplc followed by amino acid sequencing. a computer homology search of the nbrf protein
sequence data and swiss-prot data base revealed 55–
56, ⬃32, ⬃23, ⬃17 and ⬃10 kda proteins to be calcineurin␣ and ␤, 14-3-3 proteins, neurocalcins, calmodulin and s100a1 and  xxxg2007xxx , respectively. when the

eluate from bovine heart was subjected to sds/page,
only ⬃10 kda protein was detected. the partial sequence analysis of the ⬃10 kda protein band indicated
the protein was a mixture of s100a1 and  xxxg2007xxx  (data
not shown).
we have compared ca 2⫹-binding proteins bound to
olopatadine-sepharose with those bound to antiallergic drugs  xxxd157xxx  and  xxxd1763xxx , although the
structure of each drug is different (fig. 1). in addition,
olopatadine-binding ca 2⫹-dependent proteins were
compared with those bound to fluphenazine (a typical calmodulin antagonist) and to phenyl-sepharose,
which is known to interact with several ef-hand
proteins. the sds/page patterns of ca 2⫹-binding
proteins from fluphenazine-sepharose and phenylsepharose were essentially similar (fig. 2a, lanes 2
and 3). calmodulin and ⬃10 kda proteins (putative
s100 proteins) were obtained mainly from bovine lung
extracts by fluphenazine–sepharose chromatography
and phenyl–sepharose chromatography. on the other
hand, the three antiallergic drugs mainly bound s100
proteins but not calmodulin (fig. 2a, lanes 1, 4, and 5).
s100 proteins in the egta eluates from olopatadine
column,  xxxd157xxx  column,  xxxd1763xxx  column, fluphenazine column and phenyl–sepharose column were
examined by western blot analysis with several antis100 protein antibodies including anti-s100l, antis100a12 and anti- xxxg2004xxx . as shown in fig. 2b,
s100l was detected in egta eluates from antiallergic
drug column, fluphenazine-column or phenyl-sepharose column. however,  xxxg2003xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  were

point mutations of the hydrophobic residues in the
c-terminal region demonstrated that phe88, phe89
and trp90 were major interaction residues to both
phenyl-sepharose and capz peptide (11). recently, it
was found that a recombinant s100a1 lacking c-terminal nine residue has no or a remarkably reduced
ability to interact with a number of s100a1 target
proteins (12). these results strongly suggest the important role of the c-terminal extension for the target
protein recognition by s100a1. to determine the antiallergic drug binding sites and fluphenazine binding

wild type s100a1 and the c-terminal truncation mutants with olopatadine–sepharose,  xxxd157xxx –sepharose, fluphenazine–sepharose, as well as phenylsepharose was analyzed in the present study. the
amino acid sequences of each s100a1 mutant was
aligned in fig. 3a. recombinant wild type or mutant
s100a1 proteins (25 ␮g of purified proteins) were
mixed with the drug coupled sepharose beads or
phenyl-sepharose in the presence of 5 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2. after
washing in a ca 2⫹ containing buffer, bound proteins
were eluted by chelating the ca 2⫹ with 5 mm egta,
followed by 5 mm egta/3 m nacl containing buffer.
the wild type s100a1 protein was bound to phenyl–
sepharose, fluphenazine–sepharose, olopatadine–
sepharose and  xxxd157xxx –sepharose beads in the
presence of  xxxg2125xxx  2 and was eluted in the presence of
egta (fig. 3b). in this comparative binding experi-

ment, only a small amount of 1– 88, 1– 85, and 1–75
mutants interacted with phenyl–sepharose, fluphenazine–sepharose or  xxxd157xxx –sepharose beads and
proteins were mainly detected in the unbound fractions. in contrast, 1– 88 and 1– 85 mutants, but not
1–75 mutant protein, bound quantitatively to olopatadine–sepharose beads and eluted with 5 mm egta or
5 mm egta/3 m nacl containing buffer. the binding
to olopatadine–sepharose beads was, however, completely lost in the 1–75 mutant. this result shows that
amino acid residues 76 – 85 of s100a1 are necessary for
the binding of s100a1 to olopatadine.

teraction between holo (i.e., ca 2⫹-bound form) s100a1
and s100 interacting drugs. to determine whether the
c-terminal truncation mutations also affect ca 2⫹-induced conformational changes and dimer formation,
we subjected s100a1 mutants to electrophoretic mobility assay and chemical cross-linking analysis. in the
presence of  xxxg2125xxx  2, the migration of ca 2⫹-binding proteins such as calmodulin and s100 proteins on tris/
glycine gels containing no sds was shifted to the
cathode (17). this change in migration is due to the
change in net negative charge that occurs upon ca 2⫹binding. nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was used
in the present study to determine whether the mutations caused any alterations in ca 2⫹-induced conformational changes of s100a1 mutants. the 1– 88, 1– 85
and 1–75 mutants exhibited similar mobility shifts in
nondenaturing gels containing ca 2⫹ (fig. 4a) or edta
(fig. 4b), and were indistinguishable from the wild
type s100a1. these results indicate that the deletion
of residues 76 –94 does not alter the ca 2⫹-binding ability of s100a1.
another characteristic property of s100 proteins is
their tendency to dimerize itself. to determine whether
c-terminal truncation mutants of s100a1 retain the

ability of dimerization, chemical cross-linking experiments were employed using bs 3. the results from the
cross-linking experiments clearly indicated that all of
the s100a1 mutants as well as wild type protein form
homodimer (fig. 4c). the formation of homodimers
was found to occur both in presence and absence of
ca 2⫹, suggesting that the c-terminal residues 76 –94
are not essential for s100a1 dimerization. therefore,
the fact that the binding to olopatadine–sepharose
was completely lost in the 1–75 mutant is not due to
alteration of ca 2⫹-dependent conformational changes
and dimer formation. the reason for the weak binding
of 1–75 mutant to phenyl–sepharose has not been elucidated. from our results, two different binding sites of
s100a1 to antiallergic drugs were identified indicating
that s100 may play multiple roles at different sites at
its c-terminus.
competition of olopatadine and  xxxd157xxx 
on the s100a1 binding
s100a1-binding site of olopatadine differs from that
of  xxxd157xxx . therefore, we performed the experiment

s100a1-binding (fig. 5). recombinant s100a1 protein (25 ␮g of purified protein) was incubated with
 xxxd157xxx -sepharose beads and olopatadine in the
presence of 5 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2. after washing in a ca 2⫹
containing buffer, bound proteins were eluted by sds
sample buffer. s100a1 binding to  xxxd157xxx -sepharose was inhibited by 10 mm  xxxd157xxx , but had not
any effect in the presence of 10 mm olopatadine (fig.
5a). s100a1 binding to olopatadine-sepharose was
inhibited by 10 mm olopatadine, but not by 10 mm
 xxxd157xxx  (fig. 5b). olopatadine did not competitively inhibit s100a1-binding site of  xxxd157xxx . moreover,  xxxd157xxx  had no effect on the s100a1-binding
site of olopatadine. olopatadine did not share with
 xxxd157xxx  a common binding site on s100a1.
effect of olopatadine on the interaction of s100a1
with s100a1-target protein’s binding site peptides
the giant myosin-associated twitchin kinase, the
␣-subunit of the actin capping protein, capz and a
nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase, ndr have
been identified as s100a1 target proteins (4, 5, 11).
furthermore, the s100a1 c-terminal extension plays a
major role in the interaction with the s100a1 and
s100a1 target protein (reviewed in 1). to determine
the effect of olopatadine on the interaction between
the hydrophobic region at the c-terminus of s100a1
and its target proteins, we analyzed binding of s100a1
target protein’s binding site peptides to s100a1 in the
presence of olopatadine (fig. 6). we synthesized peptides for three binding sites, trtk-12 of s100a1 target
protein capz and one site each s100a1 target proteins
twitchin kinase and ndr. s100a1 was incubated with
the s100a1-binding site peptide-coupled sepharose
beads with or without olopatadine. s100a1 was bound
to trtk-peptide sepharose (fig. 6, left). in contrast, in
the presence of olopatadine amount of the unbound
s100a1 protein increased and the binding of the protein was inhibited by the drug. the results of the
binding experiments using twitchin kinase-peptide
(fig. 6, center) and ndr-peptide (fig. 6, right) were
similar to those for trtk.  xxxd1763xxx  (5 mm) and  xxxd157xxx  (5 mm) had no effect on the s100a1 binding to
the peptide-coupled sepharose beads (data not shown).
these results suggest that olopatadine may inhibit the
binding of s100a1 target protein’s binding site peptides to s100a1, and that may interact c-terminus of
s100a1.
in conclusion, the results of the present study show
that amino acid residues 76 – 85 of s100a1 are necessary for the binding of s100a1 to olopatadine and the
binding site of olopatadine on s100a1 is different from
that for other antiallergic drugs such as  xxxd157xxx 
and  xxxd1763xxx . moreover, olopatadine inhibits the
binding of s100a1 to its target proteins. taken together, the present findings indicate that olopatadine

and other antiallergic drugs may serve as useful pharmacological tools for elucidating the roles of s100 protein family.
