summary
ligand-dependent nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  (nr) signaling requires direct interaction between nr and the
steroid receptor coactivators (src). herein we utilize
a library of  xxxg1511xxx  peptidomimetics to select for specific
inhibitors of the interaction of  xxxg1511xxx  with the two  xxxg730xxx  (er) isoforms, er␣ and er␤, in the presence of three different ligands: 17␤-estradiol,  xxxd1880xxx , and genistein. the pattern of inhibitor
selectivity for each er isoform varied depending upon
which ligand was present, thus demonstrating that the
ligands exert unique allosteric effects upon the surface
of the src binding pocket. several of the lead compounds are highly (⬎100-fold) selective for blocking
the binding of  xxxg1511xxx  to er␣, in preference to er␤, in
the presence of one ligand and therefore may prove
useful for decoupling er␤ signaling from er␣ signaling.
introduction
the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily of hormoneinduced transcription factors integrates specific signals
to properly regulate distinct physiological responses including development and dynamic homeostasis [1, 2].
misregulation of these signals has been directly correlated with disease states, including various forms of
cancer and metabolic diseases [3]. the nr can act as
simple transcription factors (where they are the only
dna binding factor in the complex), as complex factors
(where they work in concert with other dna binding
factors), or as tethered factors (where their interaction
with dna is mediated by another protein) [4]. in liganddependent signaling, they generally function to activate
transcription at simple elements by the recruitment of
a family of cofactors, the steroid receptor coactivators
(srcs), through the binding of the srcs’ nuclear receptor interaction domain (nid) [3, 5] (figure 1). the srcs
themselves have several well-characterized activation
domains: one that recruits cbp/p300 [6], another that
recruits carm, an arginine methyltransferase [7], and a
domain with histone acetyl transferase activity. there
are at least three srcs: src1,  xxxg1511xxx / xxxg1511xxx / xxxg1511xxx , and
 xxxg1512xxx / xxxg1512xxx / xxxg1512xxx / xxxg1512xxx / xxxg1512xxx  [8–16]. a unified nomenclature, in which the proteins are referred to as src1,
*correspondence: rguy@cgl.ucsf.edu

 xxxg1511xxx , and  xxxg1512xxx , has been proposed by o’malley and
is adopted in this report. homozygous disruption of the
genes encoding each src causes fairly distinct phenotypes in mice, thus suggesting the possibility of distinct
mechanisms or activities for each src [17, 18]. however, there is evidence of compensatory upregulation
of  xxxg1511xxx  following disruption of src1, indicating the
possibility of partially overlapping function. the underlying biochemical mechanisms that may allow for conservation or separation of src function in ligand-dependent signaling are poorly understood. inhibitors that
would allow selective disruption of particular nr•src
interactions in vivo would be very useful in elucidating
such mechanisms.
genetic and biochemical studies have identified the
nid of the srcs, which contains multiple interaction
motifs known as nr boxes, each with a consensus sequence of l1xxl2l3 [3, 5]. the nr•src protein-protein
interaction is highly conserved across the nr superfamily, with these coactivators seemingly shared by most
or all of the nr proteins. an analogous motif (i/lxxii)
has been identified for corepressors smrt and ncor,
and the binding sites for coactivator and corepressor
may be partially overlapping [19, 20]. it appears that
corepressors can also utilize an analogous motif to mediate their interaction with nr in some contexts [21, 22].
each nr box of the srcs nid can have different
affinities for a particular nr•ligand•promotor triad and
can bind in a cooperative [23] or noncooperative [24,
25] manner. despite recent findings of additional interactions of src with nr outside the nid [26], blocking
the interaction of nr and src in cellular models by
overexpression of fusions of src nr box peptides inhibits gene transcription from elements normally responsive to hormone-induced signaling [27]. short nr
box peptides and ␣-helical peptidomimetics containing
the nr box sequence can effectively compete with the
entire nid of the  xxxg1511xxx  [24]. for example, her␣, her␤,
and htr␤ share the use of  xxxg1511xxx  despite the fact that
they regulate entirely different gene transcription pathways [28]. in vitro, htr␤ and both er isoforms tightly
bind the second nr box of  xxxg1511xxx  ( xxxg1511xxx -2), 685ekhkil1
erl2l3kds697, in the presence of their native ligands
thyroid hormone (t3) and estradiol (e2), respectively. the
er isoforms also interact with  xxxg1511xxx -1 with lesser affinity
while the trs interact with  xxxg1511xxx -3.
the estrogen receptors have distinct biological responses to different natural and synthetic estrogen-like
ligands [29–31], so-called selective estrogen response
modulators (serms). the effect of the ligand depends
primarily on the ability to alter the structure, stability,
and interactions of the receptor lbd [32]. estrogen and
estrogen-like ligands function by binding with high affinity to the ligand binding domain (lbd) and partially filling
the hydrophobic core of the domain. the ligands allosterically define the overall lbd structure by creating a
conformational change in the lbd that promotes or inhibits the binding of coregulator proteins. the er isoforms bind  xxxg1511xxx -2 when liganded with either the syn-

schematic model of the dynamic assembly of the transcription activation complex by agonist-bound  xxxg730xxx  (er) and function of
steroid receptor coactivator (src) binding inhibitors. from left to right: in the absence of ligand, chromatin is unmodified and transcription
at the dna estrogen response element (ere) is unaltered. binding of agonist ligand to the ligand binding domain (lbd) of er induces a
conformational change in er, leading to translocation and homodimerization on the ere. liganded er on the ere recruits srcs using the
nr box (l1xxl2l3) of the nuclear receptor-interacting domain (nid). subsequently, the er•src complex recruits other coregulator proteins
and transcription factors to form the activation complex where chromatin is modified and transcription of the ere gene commences. direct
competitive inhibition of src binding to nr will block the initial step of activation complex formation and thus prevent transcription.

thetic partial agonist  xxxd1880xxx  (des) or with the
phytoestrogen genistein (gen) [33]. depending on the
physiological context, the receptor isoform, and presence of particular coactivators, this combination may
result in an estrogenic, partial estrogenic, or an antiestrogenic response [34]. until now, the focus of studies
of ligand allosteric effects has been on gross structural
changes of the lbd, such as the repositioning of helix
12 and its ability to create or conceal the src binding
pocket.
structurally, the interactions of her␣ and htr␤ with
the  xxxg1511xxx -2 peptide are very similar to those of other
nr•coactivator structures solved to date [22, 24, 32,
35–37]. each seems to interact through similar surfaces
with a shallow hydrophobic groove on the nr surface
binding to an induced fit, amphipathic, ␣-helical motif
on the  xxxg1511xxx -2 nr box, burying the conserved three
leucines on the hydrophobic face of the nr box helix.
while each of the leucines in the nr box is critical to
the interaction [38], in vivo specificity in recruiting a
particular src appears to be induced by the sequences
immediately flanking the nr boxes [27, 33, 37, 39] rather
than the geometry of the leucine side chains. manipulation of nr box peptide sequence outside of the conserved l1xxl2l3 motif has afforded selective peptide
inhibitors of the interaction of particular nr and srcs,
presumably by taking advantage of these extended interactions [27, 40, 41]. however, such extended elements would not be available to a small molecule disrupting the interaction, and it is therefore uncertain how
such findings reflect upon the development of such a
drug.
as our approach targets such drugs, it was paramount
to identify subsite-specific differences within the small
hydrophobic pocket that binds the nr box that could
be effectively utilized by a small molecule. we therefore
rationally designed a series of  xxxg1511xxx -2 nr box mimetics
[42] with one of three leucines substituted on a constrained peptidomimetic scaffold [43]. despite the high
degree of structural conservation in these interfaces, it
is apparent from our recent studies that there are subtle
differences in the hydrophobic interface of each nr.

these unique characteristics of each receptor interface
allow nonnatural lxxll peptidomimetics to selectively
inhibit the interaction. for example, when targeting three
homologous nuclear receptors (htr␤, her␣, and her␤)
liganded with their physiological ligands, we found ten
peptidomimetics that were selective for her␣, one that
was selective for her␤, and one that was selective for
htr␤ by at least 10-fold [42].
herein we report our analysis of the structural foundation of this observed selectivity and the examination of
the ligand-dependent allosteric modulation of the er:
 xxxg1511xxx -2 interface by three related ligands: estrogen,  xxxd1880xxx , and genistein. in vitro competition
studies show that these binding sites are allosterically
modulated by the different ligands in a way that permits
the differential selection of  xxxg1511xxx -2 peptidomimetic inhibitors without significantly altering the binding of the
native  xxxg1511xxx -2 nr box.
results and discussion
structural analysis of nr•src interactions
at the protein fold level, the differences between the nr
coactivator interfaces (figures 2b–2d) of t3•htr␤•
 xxxg1511xxx -2 [24], des•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -2 [32], and e2•her␣•
 xxxg1511xxx -3 [44] appear minimal. each of the  xxxg1511xxx  peptide
main chain rmsd’s is less than 1.0 å, and the receptor
main chain rmsd’s are less than 2.0 å. however, upon
closer investigation, we find that there are differences
in the side chain positions within each pocket and within
pocket surfaces that alter the electrostatics, topography, and the location of solvent-accessible volume between the pockets of each receptor (figures 2e and 2f).
in particular, comparing htr␤ and her␣ reveals that
her␣ (figure 2c) has a ridge with a continuous electrostatic potential adjacent to the l2 subpocket, whereas
htr␤ (figure 2b) has a subpocket that is sterically hindered by a more significant plateau with a gradient of
electrostatic potential. additionally, a pronounced ridge
in htr␤ creates more steric hindrance between the l1
and l3 subpockets than what is present in her␣. a total

the secondary structure of the proteins is identified in gray with each helix numbered according to the convention for nr. amino acids are

the htr␤ and the two er isoforms but are the same between the isoforms; (␴) indicates the residues that are the same across all the receptors;
and (⌬) indicates residues that different across each receptor. this clearly demonstrates differences in the side chain character of the src
binding pocket. (␭) indicates residues that have a different type of interaction with the coactivator.

src binding pocket in each cocrystal structure is shown as a cross-section through the l1 and l3 recognition pockets to highlight structural
and electrostatic differences within the highly conserved binding pockets. the three leucine side chains of the  xxxg1511xxx -2 (l1xxl2l3) and the
 xxxg1511xxx -3 (lltxxll) motifs (yellow wire frame) are labeled l1 l2 l3. each receptor conolly surface was generated with a probe of 1.4 å radius
and color coded to induce a continuous electrostatic gradient (sybyl). these views demonstrate clear significant differences in steric structure
and electrostatics between the htr␤ and her␣ src binding pockets (b versus c) as well as potential plasticity within her␣ surface (c versus
d). these structural and volumetric differences between each comparison are highlighted in (e) and (f) with difference maps consisting of
2.2 å radius spheres that differentially fill each pocket of each receptor. (e)–(g) are oriented the same as (b)–(d): (pymol) spheres of 2.2 å
radius filled the solvent accessible volume of each receptor pocket. spheres were compared and removed if shared between receptor pockets,
leaving only those that were present in one structure and not the other. in (e), blue web spheres highlight the location of eight spheres totaling
357 å3 of volume that is available in the her␣ pocket and not in the htr␤ pocket. in f, six red spheres locating 268 å3 of volume that is
available in htr␤ and not her␣. (g) shows a similar comparison between the pockets of (c) des•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -2 and (d) e2•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -3,
with blue denoting the location of nine spheres totaling 401 å3 present in the pocket of des•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -2 and not in e2•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -3; and
the reverse comparison also showing nine red spheres but in different locations. this highlights that the pocket has changed in topography
without a change in accessible volume, possibly due to the change in ligand or in response to the different src-interaction motif.

her␣ and htr␤ are either buried by  xxxg1511xxx -2 or form
direct contacts with the nr box (figure 2a). only eight
of these amino acid residues are conserved between
the two receptors. fifteen of the 19 residues are different
between tr␤ and er␣ by sequence or degree of physical interaction with the  xxxg1511xxx -2 nr box leucines (l354i,
v355t, m357v, i358v, v364l, v368c, l372c, v376i,
e380k, d538p, m543v f367f, and q375q; er␣ number-

ing, see figure 2). eight of these form unique direct
contacts (underlined) with the leucines of  xxxg1511xxx -2 in one
receptor and not the other, while two residues (c381g
and a382c) are buried in the tr pocket but not with
er␣. four nonconserved residues (l354i, m357v, i358v,
and v364l) are conservative substitutions, while six
(v355t, v368c, l372c, c381g, a382c, and d538p) exhibit large changes in shape, electrostatics, or hydrogen

bonding potential. the presence of four surfaceexposed cysteines in the coactivator binding pocket on
tr is somewhat surprising and may point to a potential
for regulation of coactivator binding by oxidative posttranslational modifications such as nitrosylation, which
have been observed with other transcription factors [45].
the relative location and substitutions of proline and
glycine between er and tr are of some interest and
may reflect potential for greater flexibility of secondary
structure in er.
the two er isoforms have 59% homology in the ligand
binding domain [46], suggesting that achieving selectivity between them would be difficult. assuming that er␣
and er␤ interact with the  xxxg1511xxx -2 peptide similarly (no
cocrystal structure of er␤• xxxg1511xxx -2 is available), only 2
of the 19 residues lining the pocket are different between
the er isoforms. v364i is a fairly conservative change,
while d538y (her␣ numbering) is a major change. two
spatially adjacent substitutions (c381s and a382c)
present changes in electrostatic or hydrogen bonding
potential.
to aid analysis, we generated volume maps of the nr
box binding sites for the receptors and quantitatively
subtracted them from one another to compare differences (figures 2e–2g). this analysis revealed that there
is 357 å3 available in the er␣ pocket that was not addressable from the htr␤ pocket (figure 2e) and 268 å3
available in htr␤ but not in her␣ (figure 2f). a similar
comparison of her␣ with two different ligands and different  xxxg1511xxx  peptides, des•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -2 and e2•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -3 [44], shows significant differences within the
pocket (figure 2g). there is not a change in the overall
volume of the pocket but rather a change in the location
of solvent accessible volume. however, this last comparison is complicated by the multiple differences in the
crystallization conditions of her␣ (including ligand and
peptide partner), which prevent unambiguous assignment of surface differences to the change in the ligand,
the change in nr box peptide sequence, or both.
overall, this analysis confirmed that, while the differences in the coactivator binding pockets are subtle,
there is typically at least 250 å3 in volume change and
accompanying changes in electrostatics from nr•
ligand pair to pair. in general, the large number of significant changes in residues involved in coactivator binding
partially explains our ability to find specific inhibitors
targeted at this pocket [42]. however, as will be discussed below, they do not allow for computational predetermination of selectivity.

screening for ligand•nr-selective
peptidomimetics
previous reports of the effects on er␣ and er␤ interactions with  xxxg1511xxx -2 peptides in the presence of these
ligands indicated that there was little change in the recruitment of the individual boxes [33]. while the ligands
do not significantly perturb the binding of the native
lxxll nr box motifs, our analysis indicated that the
hydrophobic pocket was being modulated in such a way
that the binding of other nonnatural leucine mimetics
would be significantly effected. to explore this idea,
we screened the library against her␣ and her␤ in the
presence of different ligands, including a synthetic es-

trogen analog  xxxd1880xxx  (des) and the phytoestrogen genistein (gen), both partial agonists that have
been shown to recruit  xxxg1511xxx -2 to both er isoforms.
this peptidomimetic library utilizes an ␣-helical scaffold (figure 3a) [43]: a conformationally constrained nr
box peptide 1{37,37,37} that functionally disrupts the
interaction of  xxxg1511xxx  and htr␤. peptidomimetic 1{37,
37,37} binds to htr␤ 15-fold better than the native
 xxxg1511xxx -2 peptide: 10.8 ␮m and 0.79 ␮m, respectively [43].
we utilized this lead compound as a constrained helical
scaffold for the presentation of a library of compounds
with nonnatural amino acid side chains that mimic each
of the three leucines within the lxxll motif. each member of this library was comprised of a unique compound,
synthesized in parallel, that had one of the leucines
changed to a nonnatural amino acid—predominantly
substituted phenylalanines and phenylglycines. each library member was purified by rp-hplc, and purity and
identity were confirmed prior to use [42].
the competitive ability of each of the library members
to inhibit the binding of  xxxg1511xxx -2 to the two er isoforms
was assessed using a fluorescence polarization equilibrium competition assay as previously described [42].
the og- xxxg1511xxx -2 probe bound to each receptor in a ligand-dependent manner with kds of 299 nm, 310 nm,
and 450 nm for e2•her␣, des•her␣, and gen•her␣,
and 370 nm, 450 nm, and 520 nm, for e2•her␤, des•
her␤, and gen•her␤, respectively. the lead compound
1{37,37,37} competed for each of these interactions with
 xxxg1511xxx -2 with ic50 values of 120 nm, 290 nm, and 110 nm
for e2•her␣, des•her␣, and gen•her␣, and 151 nm,
261 nm, and 350 nm for e2•her␤, des•her␤, and
gen•her␤, respectively. there is little selectivity between isoforms with the lead compound relative to the
natural affinities of  xxxg1511xxx -2. the entire library was then
screened with each receptor•ligand pair. surprisingly,
many of the compounds that were previously identified
to inhibit the e2•her␣ interaction with  xxxg1511xxx -2 did not
inhibit interaction with either one or both of the des- or
gen-bound her␣. likewise, several of the compounds
that did not seem to target e2•her␣ inhibited the  xxxg1511xxx -2
interaction with des•her␣ or gen•her␣ (figure 3b).
the selectivity of twelve inhibitors changed by 10-fold
for her␣ in a ligand-dependent fashion. at l1, the parafluorophenylglycine 1{3,37,37} effectively targeted only
the des•her␣ form of the receptor. at l2, the metatrifluoromethylphenylglycine 1{37,9,37} targeted e2•
her␣, the cyclohexylalanine 1{37,20,37} was selective
for both the e2 and des liganded forms of her␣, the
cyclopentylphenylglycine 1{37,28,37} was selective for
des over gen but not between des and e2, and tryptophan 1{37,34,37} is highly selective for the des-bound
form of her␣. at the l3 position, three phenylglycine
compounds were selective for e2: 2,3-difluorophenylglycine, 3,4-difluorophenylglycine, and 1,5-difluorophenylglycine, 1{37,37,4}, 1{37,37,5}, and 1{37,37,6}. the ortho-chlorophenylalanine 1{37,37,14} and tryptophan
1{37,37,34} selected for the des•er␣ ligand (figure 3c).
the specificity of sixteen inhibitors changed for her␤
between the three ligands. at the first leucine position
l1, the phenylglycine 1{1,37,37} was selective for des
and gen over e2. the cyclohexylalanine 1{20,37,37} and
cyclopentylphenylalanine 1{29,37,37} were selective for
both e2 and des over gen. at position l2, phenyl glycine

a total of 19 inhibitors were selective for her␣ over

1{10,37,37}, 1{32,37,37}, 1{34,37,37}), four at l2 (1{37,
1,37}, 1{37,9,37}, 1{37,16,37}, 1{37,20,37}), and 11 at l3
(1{37,37,1}, 1{37,37,3}, 1{37,37,8}, 1{37,37,13}, 1{37,37,

1{37,37,32}, 1{37,37,34}). fifteen inhibitors were selective for her␣ over her␤ when bound to des: three with
substitutions at l1 (1{16,37,37}, 1{32,37,37}, 1{34,37,37}),
seven at l2 (1{37,4,37}, 1{37,7,37}, 1{37,9,37}, 1{37,
19,37}, 1{37,20,37}, 1{37,34,37}, 1{37,35,37}), and five
at l3 (1{37,37,12}, 1{37,37,23}, 1{37,37,27}, 1{37,37,32},
1{37,37,34}). six were selective for her␣ in the presence
of gen: three with substitutions at l1 (1{1,37,37}, 1{20,
37,37}, 1{34,37,37}), one at l2 (1{37,11,37}), and two at
l3 (1{37,37,22), 1{37,37,36}). two of the inhibitors were
selective for her␤: the previously identified ortho-chlorophenylalanine at l2, 1{37,14,37}, in the presence of e2,
and tryptophan at l3, 1{37,37,34}, in the presence of
gen. fourteen of these inhibitors were specific to her␣
with ⬎50-fold selectivity over her␤ in the presence of
one of the three ligands (figure 3d). this set represent
the most promising leads for physiologic study or novel
therapy. each of these compounds has the potential to
highly selectively abrogate er␣ signaling induced by a
particular ligand without affecting that of er␤.

analysis of structural determinants of selectivity
the interaction modes of a number of the selective inhibitors were evaluated using dock (figures 4a–4f). comparing the results of the in silico combidock screening
and the in vitro competition data of the same library
reveals that while this method was very useful for enhancing the likelihood of the library producing competent inhibitors, it was not effective for predicting selectivity between the nr. many of the compounds scored
similarly between the receptors and in almost identical
minimized positions. the only correlation related to selectivity that is apparent between the in silico and in
vitro binding studies is the size of the side chains. larger
residues at positions l1 and l3 score slightly better when
docked with des:her␣ than t3:htr␤, and that trend
is apparent in the competition assays. several docked
inhibitor structures seemed to take advantage of the
differences that were identified by the structural and
volumetric analysis (figures 2b–2g). peptidomimetics
1{37,8,37} and 1{37,37,14}, for example, bury solvent
accessible volume that was identified in er␣ and not
in tr␤ (figure 4). however, a number of the selective

inhibitors would not fit into the pocket unless the van
der waals constraints were relaxed by 0.2 å (data not
shown). these compounds represent selectivity that
could not be predicted computationally.
er␣ clearly tolerates larger groups within the nr box
binding pocket than the crystal structures indicate
would be possible. this finding is most likely explained
by one of two models: (1) the src peptidomimetic inhibitors are binding in a different orientation than what is
seen from the native peptide crystal structures, and/or
(2) the surface of her␣ is plastic and is responding to
the inhibitors in a way that permits these compounds
to unveil new subsites that are energetically favorable.
the latter may be possible due to the reduced entropic
cost of peptide helix formation translating into additional
binding energy that perturbs the receptor surface differently than the crystal refined state.

discussion
the src binding pockets of nr have evolved to bind
to a simple hydrophobic l1xxl2l3 consensus motif while
relying upon differences in src sequences flanking the
nr box to convey selectivity in vivo. our studies show
that er has a tolerance and even strong selection for
aromatic moieties replacing the leucine side chains
when presented on an appropriate peptidomimetic scaffold. this observation is in stark contrast to prior studies
with expressed peptide libraries [27, 41] that did not
select for phenylalanine, possibly due to its negative
effect on the helicity of unconstrained peptides. our
studies reveal that the nr box binding pockets of the
nr contain significant differences in shape and electrostatics that allow competitive inhibitors that mimic the
nr box to act selectively between nr and even between
the same nr when a different is ligand bound.
these results were only obtained by utilizing a constrained scaffold that removes the entropic cost of helix
formation in this induced-fit ␣ helix protein-protein interaction. other methodologies utilizing linear peptide libraries composed of natural amino acids have been
unable to select for side chains other than leucine with
these receptors [27, 41]. linear peptides with a phenylalanine substituted at each of the leucine positions of
a similar peptide from the  xxxg1511xxx -2 (khkifhrllqdss,
khkilhrflqdss, and khkilhrlfqdss) [24] reduced
the competitive ability of the  xxxg1511xxx -2 peptide by 60- to
100-fold, the worst being the l1 substitution [24]. here,
we clearly show that such phenylalanine replacements,
as well as substituted phenylalanine analogs, are able
to inhibit  xxxg1511xxx -2 binding quite well. tryptophan, which
has not been selected in genetic screens, also clearly
works well in a constrained peptide background. it is
our belief that these larger side chains fit quite well into
the interface, but only when presented on a properly
folded ␣ helix. this apparent disparity suggests that the
previous hypothesis that these nr cannot tolerate the
larger side chains may be incorrect. an alternate explanation consistent with both sets of data is that the effect
of each residue on the helicity of the given peptide sequence, in combination with the size-shape complementarity to the receptor surface, controls affinity. this
hypothesis begs the question: are their other, yet to be

selective inhibitors of er•src interactions

figure 4. docked structures of two selective inhibitors
(a–c) the energy minimized structure of the her␣•des-selective inhibitor 1{37,8,37} with o- trifluoromethylphenylglycine replacing the second
leucine of the nr box. 1{37,8,37} scored the highest in the docking studies with both receptors her␣•des and htr␤•t3.
(d–f) the inhibitor 1{37,37,14} with o-chlorophenylalanine replacing the third leucine of the nr box, which scored better with her␣•des than
with htr␤•t3. each of the docked inhibitor structures was similar in orientation to that of the crystallographic coordinates of  xxxg1511xxx -2. the
rmsd values were as follows: 1{37,8,37} at ⬍0.2 å and 1{37,37,14} at ⬍0.6 å. a number of selective inhibitors would not dock in the normal
orientation without relaxation of the restrictions to maintain the normal relationship between the peptide backbone and the receptor.

identified, nr interactions at this site with proteins that
have different sequences? these could easily include
larger side chains that are stabilized into ␣-helical secondary structures by their tertiary structures. a second
interesting question arises: how do the flanking sequences around the nr box lxxll motif drive selectivity? is it due to their direct contacts with the receptor
surface, as has been previously suggested [27, 41], or
is it due to some effect on helicity? the notion that they
make particular contacts with the receptor surface to
drive the interactions has been difficult to verify both
structurally and biochemically. the flanking sequences
could engender different levels of helicity by effecting
helix dipole or through specific contacts. additionally,
there may be transient interactions with the surface of
the receptors that seed the induction of helicity, as has
been recently suggested [44].
another finding arising from our data is that the partial
er agonists are allosterically modulating “subsites” of
the leucine recognition pockets without perturbing the
interactions of the native lxxll nr box sequences.
this suggests that one could potentially simultaneously
target one receptor with, for example, an er isoformspecific ligand and a src peptidomimetic inhibitor that
is selective for that combination.
a similar failure to evolve tight shape complementarity
between receptor and peptide ligand has been observed
in the interactions of sh3 domains [47]. it seems like

this may be a common situation in signaling interactions
that function dynamically with relatively weak affinity for
their partners. these systems may represent a particularly tractable subset of protein interactions for inhibitor
development. the successful identification of specific
inhibitors of the e2•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -2 protein interaction utilizing nonnatural ␣-amino acids in an ␣-helical peptidomimetic library demonstrates the feasibility of specifically targeting the competition of protein interactions
where consensus motifs consist entirely of a small hydrophobic patch. this preliminary study has already
yielded inhibitors of er␣ interactions with  xxxg1511xxx  that
are functionally selective for that isoform in preference
to effecting interactions of er␤.
significance
ligand-dependent nuclear  xxxg1603xxx  (nr) signaling requires direct interaction between nr and the
steroid receptor coactivators (src), effected by a series of conserved src motifs that are composed of
three leucines (nr box, l1xxl2l3). we have previously
shown that peptidomimetics of the second nr box
of  xxxg1511xxx  ( xxxg1511xxx -2) can exploit structural differences
between the nr box binding pockets of the thyroid
 xxxg1603xxx  ␤ (tr␤) bound to thyroid hormone
(t3), and the two  xxxg730xxx  (er) isoforms (er␣
and er␤), each bound to estrogen (e2). in this report,

chemistry & biology

we demonstrate that the same library of  xxxg1511xxx -2 peptidomimetic inhibitors can take advantage of differences between the nr box binding pockets of er␣
and er␤ in the presence of three different ligands,
17␤-estradiol (e2),  xxxd1880xxx  (des), and genistein (gen), to afford specific inhibitors. the selection
profile for each er isoform, and between isoforms,
changed depending on which ligand was present.
therefore, the simple hydrophobic src binding pocket
surface on nr is allosterically modulated differently
by each ligand. fourteen of these inhibitors were specific for preventing recruitment of  xxxg1511xxx  by her␣
with ⬎50-fold selectivity relative to inhibiting the same
interaction for her␤ in the presence of one of the three
ligands. each of these compounds has the potential to
decouple er␣ signaling induced by a particular ligand
from that of er␤. because this selectivity is induced
solely by manipulating the side chain of one leucine
in the analogs, small molecules targeted to this pocket
could achieve selectivity for a particular er•ligand pair
by the same mode.
experimental procedures
volumetric analysis
publicly available structures t3•htr␤• xxxg1511xxx -2 (protein database
[pdb] id code 1bsx), e2•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -3 (pdb id code 1gwr), and
des•her␣• xxxg1511xxx -2 (pdb id code  xxxd1880xxx ) were utilized for computational evaluation. a perl script was written to identify solvent accessible volume on the surfaces of protein (a. shelat, ucsf). the pdb
structures were aligned by the c␣ and c␤ positions of the three
leucines (or two leucines and a tyrosine for 1gwr) with rmsd ⬍0.01 å
of the  xxxg1511xxx  coactivator peptide. the coactivator peptide was removed from the structure and a box of 4 ⫻ 4 ⫻ 4 å3 in dimension
was defined with a center defined in pdb coordinate space at the
center of the binding pocket. the pockets of both receptors were
filled with spheres. those that came in contact with the receptor
surface of a given receptor were removed. the sphere sets were
compared between receptors, and those that were identical in both
receptors were deleted, while those that were different between
receptors were defined as a receptor specific difference. the maps
were visualized by imposing a continuous surface onto the remaining spheres.
peptidomimetic library synthesis
the design, synthesis, and characterization of this library was executed as reported [42, 43]. briefly, orthogonally protected peptidomimetics for the chemset were synthesized on solid support in
robbins blocks (48 wells/block) with 100 mg resin/well with a resin
loading of 0.48 mmol/g as previously described. the conformational
constraint was introduced while attached to the resin. after cleavage
from the resin and concomitant side chain deprotection, all compounds were purified using hplc. compound identity was confirmed by uv spectroscopy, maldi-tof ms, and esi quadrapole ms.
fluorescence polarization competition
fluorescence polarization competition was performed as previously
reported [42, 43]. using a ljl biosystems analyst (foster city, ca),
experiments were carried out with the following conditions:  xxxg1511xxx -2
probe concentration constant  xxxd1891xxx  nm; her␣ lbd concentration
constant at 200 nm or her␤ lbd constant at 400nm; and ligand
concentration constant  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m. the effective binding buffer was
20 mm tris (ph 7.4), 100 mm nacl, 40mm kcl, 1 mm dtt, 1 mm
edta, 0.01% np-40.
h6-her␣ and h6-her␤ protein expression and purification
h6-her␣ lbd and h6-her␤ lbd were expressed in escherichia coli
bl21(de3) as previously described [42].
