randomized trial of  xxxd3115xxx , a combined  xxxg2254xxx  inhibitor and thromboxane a2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, versu...  aspirin, by nonselectively blocking cyclooxygenase both in platelets and in endothelial cells, not only inhibits the thromboxane a2 pathway of platelet activation but at the same time also the generation of vasodilating and platelet-inhibitory prostanoids, such as prostacyclin, by the endothelial cells.  xxxd3115xxx , by inhibiting  xxxg2254xxx  and blocking the thromboxane a2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors, is a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin and might offer an advantage over aspirin as an adjunct to thrombolysis. this study was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of  xxxd3115xxx  with that of aspirin as conjunctive therapy for thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
