abstract: a series of novel tetracyclic tetrahydrofuran derivatives was prepared and evaluated for its potential psychotropic properties. in vitro affinities for multiple dopaminergic, serotonergic, r-adrenergic, and histamine receptors and
for the  xxxg2148xxx  as well as the ed50 values
obtained in some in vivo assays for antipsychotic, anxiolytic,
and antidepressant potential are reported. compounds (-)-1,
(-)-8d, and (+)-8d have been identified as potential broadspectrum psychotropic agents.

activation of central dopaminergic systems is generally considered to be the most important factor in the
etiology of schizophrenia.1,2 until mid 1980s, haloperidol3 was thought to be the prototype antipsychotic.4 the
compound is very effective in reducing the positive
symptomatology (hallucinations, delusional thinking,
severe excitement, and unusual behavior). like all
neuroleptics, however, haloperidol has the disadvantages of extrapyramidal side effects (eps) and of a
limited effect on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anergy, apathy, lack of drive, social
withdrawal, and depressive mood.5 nowadays it is
thought that concomitant 5-ht2a antagonism may
overcome the drawbacks of central  xxxg656xxx  blockade.6,7 this concept is corroborated by the clinical results
obtained with the second generation antipsychotics, all
having the common property of central d2 antagonism
with predominant 5-ht2a antagonism (chart 1: clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine) and all claimed
to be atypical in having extended effects on negative
symptoms and reduced eps liability.8,9 this second
generation of antipsychotics has the ability to simultaneously interact with different monoaminergic systems
such as the dopaminergic-, serotonergic-, muscarinic-,
r-adrenergic-, and histamine h1-sites. this rich pharmacological profile may explain that more than 70% of
prescriptions for atypical antipsychotic medications are
being used for other conditions than schizophrenia.10
the same concept of “rich pharmacological profile” has
been exploited in depression with the development of
 xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd2651xxx  (chart 2). both compounds

show their antidepressant activity by interaction with
several receptors, enhancing multiple monoaminergic
system activities in parallel, thus broadening their
potential application to different depressive conditions.11
furthermore, the same approach has been successfully explored by combination of two different compounds (olanzapine/fluoxetine,  xxxd2773xxx )12 for the
treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar
disorder, another complex psychiatric illness. along the
same line, olanzapine was recently approved by the us
fda for the treatment of acute mania and the prevention of relapse in bipolar disorders.13
some years ago we started a program at johnson &
johnson pharmaceutical research and development
searching for potent and centrally active 5-ht2a/2c
receptor antagonists as potential anxiolytic/antidepressant agents. as a result of our synthesis program, we
have recently described series of tetracyclic tetrahydrofuran derivatives having 5-ht2a/2c antagonism.14,15 one
of those compounds, (-)-1 (chart 3), was a potent
m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mcpp) antagonist as shown
in our in vivo mcpp challenge test and which might

correspond to anxiolytic activity.15,16 we report herein
the preliminary results of our efforts in the chemical
improvement of this scaffold (chart 3, analogues 7 and
8) that have led to the discovery of a family of potent
broad-spectrum psychotropic compounds 8. the in vitro
binding affinities for various cns receptors, as well as
the ed50 values in some in vivo behavioral animal
models for the most interesting compounds within this
series are reported in this communication.
the synthesis of the target compounds 7a-d and
8a-d was achieved by the general method shown in
schemes 1 and 2.14,15 first, the reaction of the corresponding tricyclic ketones 2a-d17,18 with sodium hydride, followed by addition of allyl bromide afforded the
r-allylated ketones 3a-d in good to moderate yields
(40-90%, scheme 1). the reduction of ketones 3a-d
with l-selectride at -30 °c in thf gave the expected
cis alcohols 4a-d with complete diastereoselectivity and
excellent yields (90-97%), as it is shown in scheme 1.
the required trans beta-allylic alcohols 5a-d were prepared by mitsunobu inversion reaction of the cis alcohols
4a-d with p-nitrobenzoic acid, followed by ester hy-

letters

drolysis, in good overall yields (70-83%). the construction of the tetrahydrofuran ring was performed by
iodocyclization of the corresponding alcohols 5a-d with
ipy2bf4 [bis(pyridine)iodonium(i) tetrafluoroborate; barluenga’s reagent],19 as it is shown in scheme 2. the
tetracyclic iodo derivatives 6a-d were obtained in
excellent yields (85-94%) as nearly equimolecular
mixtures of diastereoisomers. finally, the displacement
of the iodine atom of 6a-d by dimethylamine afforded
the corresponding target compounds 7 and 8 as mixtures of diastereoisomers, that were separated by hplc
chromatography.
the relative stereochemistry of each pure diastereoisomer 7a-d and 8a-d was assigned by means of
2d-noesy experiments. compound 8d was separated
into its corresponding pair of enantiomers (+)-8d/
(-)-8d by chiral hplc chromatography.
the binding affinities of (-)-1 and the new compounds
7 and 8 for the dopaminergic (d1, d2, d3), serotonergic
(5-ht2a, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1120xxx ), r-adrenergic (r1, r2a, r2c), and
h1 receptors and the norepinephrine (net) transporter
are shown in table 1. binding data obtained for haloperidol and several marketed psychotropics under the
same experimental conditions are also shown.
structure-activity relationships were first studied to
determine the optimal relative configuration of the new
halo-substituted tetracyclic tetrahydrofuran derivatives
7, 8. as can be deduced from the data presented in table
1, compounds 8a-d, presenting the same relative
stereochemistry around the tetrahydrofuran ring as in
(-)-1, were clearly superior to their corresponding pairs
(epimers at position 2, chart 3) 7a-d. the analogues
with a sulfur (7d and 8d) spacer between the two
aromatic rings maintained a similar receptor profile to
that of (-)-1, showing nanomolar activities for the whole
panel of cns receptors studied. in general, the dibenzoxepin derivatives (x ) o) showed lower affinities than
(-)-1 and the sulfur analogues (7d, 8d) for most of the
receptors, 8b (x ) o; y ) cl) being an exception. the
high affinity for the 5-ht2c and h1 receptors was a
constant for the whole series. also remarkable was that
the presence of a halogen atom at c11 position (chart
3) resulted in a marked increase in d2 binding affinity.
this effect was clearly pronounced for compounds 8b
and 8d when compared with compound (-)-1. these rich
binding profiles encouraged us to resolve chromatographically the racemate 8d and study in detail the
enantiomerically pure analogues (-)-8d and (+)-8d.
additionally a broader pharmacological characterization
of (-)-1 was also considered.
the ki values for the enantiomers (-)-1, (-)-8d, and
(+)-8d were compared with those obtained for haloperidol and the broad-spectrum psychotropics clozapine,
olanzapine, risperidone,  xxxd2651xxx , and  xxxd2637xxx  in
table 1.
(-)-1 was selected as the lead compound of the series.
the compound, in addition to the reported high affinities
for 5-ht2a, 5-ht2c, and h1 receptors,15 was found to be
a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (net, ki )
7.8) with high affinity for  xxxg1120xxx  receptors as well.
additionally it showed moderate affinities for dopaminergic and r-adrenergic receptors. compound (-)-8d
possessed higher affinities for each of the receptors
tested than its corresponding enantiomeric pair (+)-8d,

except for the  xxxg657xxx , for which both compounds
showed equipotent activities. compound (-)-8d showed
higher or comparable ki values for d2, 5-ht2a 5-ht2c,
and  xxxg1120xxx  receptors than the marketed atypical antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone and the
antidepressants  xxxd2651xxx  and  xxxd2637xxx , the affinity
for the  xxxg656xxx  being comparable to that of haloperidol, a classical d2 blocker. additionally, (-)-1,
(+)-8d, and (-)-8d showed high affinities for the  xxxg2148xxx , the enantiomerically pure compounds (-)-1, (-)-8d, and (+)-8d were tested in several
of our in vivo animal behavioral models to further
evaluate their therapeutic potential.
the compounds were studied in rats, after subcutaneous administration, for their ability to (1) inhibit apomorphine-induced agitation, which predicts central d2
antagonism and therefore antipsychotic activity,20 (2)
reverse tryptamine-induced cyanosis and bilateral convulsions (predictable for peripheral and central 5-ht2a
antagonism),20 (3) reverse tryptamine-induced backward
locomotion20 and m-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced anxiety,16 thought to reflect central 5-ht2c antagonism and
anxiolytic properties. the potential antidepressant component of the compounds (due to their affinity for net)
were evaluated in mice by measuring their ability to
reverse ro-4-1284-induced hypothermia.21

the results obtained from the in vivo studies for the
compounds (-)-1, (-)-8d, and (+)-8d are shown in table
2. the data obtained for some reference compounds
(haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone,  xxxd2651xxx ,  xxxd2637xxx ) are also presented. our lead
compound, within the series of tetrahydrofuran derivatives, (-)-1 showed activity in the six in vivo assays
shown in table 2, being especially active for reversal of
the tryptamine-induced cyanosis and bilateral convulsions with an ed50 of 0.020 mg/kg in both tests. the
compound also antagonized mcpp-induced anxiety with
an ed50 of 0.18 mg/kg. these results are in concordance
with the binding affinities shown in table 1.
as it could be anticipated from the binding studies,
the enantiomer (-)-8d was clearly superior to its
corresponding pair (+)-8d and compound (-)-1 in all the
in vivo models with the exception of the mcpp test,
where both compounds were inactive. it is noteworthy
that these compounds showed relevant higher potency
in the tryptamine tests, predictable for 5-ht2a antagonism, than in the apomorphine assay, which predicts
d2 antagonism.
the activities shown by (-)-1, (+)-8d, and (-)-8d are
comparable to those obtained with the second-generation antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) in the tests related to the inhibition of apomor-

phine and tryptamine-induced effects (table 2, see ed50
values for the first four tests). furthermore, as it was
previously disclosed,15 (-)-1 antagonized mcpp-induced
anxiety in rats at similar doses as the marketed
antidepressants  xxxd2637xxx  and  xxxd2651xxx . a differentiating feature to any of the reference compounds
shown in table 2 is the ability of these tetracyclic
tetrahydrofuran analogues to reverse ro-4-1284-induced hypothermia in mice at low doses, which could
be predictive for an antidepressant component, that
might indicate a potential application to the treatment
of bipolar disorders.
as a conclusion, compounds (-)-1, (+)-8d, and
(-)-8d stand for the most potent members of this new
family of tetracyclic tetrahydrofuran derivatives. our
data show that these molecules present a wide profile
of pharmacological activities with potential clinical
interest. clinical trials should prove to what extent
these compounds have a real benefit over the current
therapies for the treatment of psychoaffective disorders.
these studies are in progress and will be reported in
due course.
