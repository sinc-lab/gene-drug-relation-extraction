summary
abstract

 xxxd2444xxx  is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion and also exhibits antibacterial activity against helicobacter pylori in vitro.
current therapy for peptic ulcer disease focuses on the eradication of h. pylori
infection with maintenance therapy indicated in those patients who are not cured
of h. pylori and those with ulcers resistant to healing.  xxxd2444xxx  30mg combined with amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 250 or 500mg, or metronidazole
400mg twice daily was associated with eradication rates ranging from 71 to 94%,
and ulcer healing rates were generally >80% in well designed studies. in addition,
it was as effective as omeprazole- or  xxxd3070xxx -based regimens which included
these antimicrobial agents. maintenance therapy with  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day
was significantly more effective than either placebo or ranitidine in preventing
ulcer relapse. importantly, preliminary data suggest that  xxxd2444xxx -based eradication therapy is effective in children and the elderly.
in the short-term treatment of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
(gord),  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 or 60 mg/day was significantly more effective than
placebo, ranitidine 300 mg/day or  xxxd1708xxx  40 mg/day and similar in efficacy to
pantoprazole 40 mg/day in terms of healing of oesophagitis.  xxxd2444xxx  30
mg/day, omeprazole 20 mg/day and pantoprazole 40 mg/day all provided similar
symptom relief in these patients. in patients with healed oesophagitis, 12-month
maintenance therapy with  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day prevented recurrence
and was similar to or more effective than omeprazole 10 or 20 mg/day.
available data in patients with nsaid-related disorders or acid-related dyspepsia suggest that  xxxd2444xxx  is effective in these patients in terms of the
prevention of nsaid-related gastrointestinal complications, ulcer healing and
symptom relief.

cate that  xxxd2444xxx  is well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination
with antimicrobial agents. after  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy commonly reported
adverse events included dose-dependent diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, headache
and abdominal pain. after short-term treatment in patients with peptic ulcer,
gord, dyspepsia and gastritis the incidence of adverse events associated with
 xxxd2444xxx  was generally ≤5%. similar adverse events were seen in long-term
trials, although the incidence was generally higher (≤10%). when  xxxd2444xxx 
was administered in combination with amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole adverse events included diarrhoea, headache and taste disturbance.
in conclusion,  xxxd2444xxx -based triple therapy is an effective treatment option for the eradication of h. pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease.
preliminary data suggest it may have an important role in the management of this
infection in children and the elderly. in the short-term management of gord,
 xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy offers a more effective alternative to histamine
h2-receptor antagonists and initial data indicate that it is an effective short-term
treatment option in children and adolescents. in adults  xxxd2444xxx  maintenance
therapy is also an established treatment option for the long-term management of
this chronic disease.  xxxd2444xxx  has a role in the treatment and prevention of
nsaid-related ulcers and the treatment of acid-related dyspepsia; however, further studies are needed to confirm its place in these indications.  xxxd2444xxx  has
emerged as a useful and well tolerated treatment option in the management of
acid-related disorders.
pharmacodynamic
properties

 xxxd2444xxx  inhibits gastric acid secretion via selective inhibition of the proton
pump of the gastric parietal cell. its active sulphenamide metabolites inactivate
h+, k+-atpase which catalyses the final step in the gastric acid secretion pathway.
data from healthy volunteers showed that  xxxd2444xxx  30mg provided faster
control of intragastric acidity than pantoprazole 40mg,  xxxd3070xxx  20mg and
omeprazole 20 and 40mg administered once daily. however, in terms of mean
intragastric 24-hour ph,  xxxd2444xxx  30mg was equivalent to omeprazole 40mg
and better than pantoprazole 40mg and omeprazole 20mg. the duration of increased intragastric ph above ph 3 or 4 was significantly longer for  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg versus pantoprazole 40mg or omeprazole 20mg;  xxxd2444xxx  15 mg/day
and omeprazole 20 mg/day were equivalent.
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day significantly increased mean 24-hour gastric ph values compared with ranitidine 600 mg/day in a well designed crossover 5-day
study. in addition, the percentage of time for which intragastric ph was maintained above 4 was significantly greater for  xxxd2444xxx  than for ranitidine.
in a well designed crossover study in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux
disease (gord),  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day and omeprazole 20 mg/day increased
median daytime and night-time intragastric ph to a similar extent. although, on
day 5 of treatment the total time spent with a mean oesophageal ph value of <4
was significantly shorter for  xxxd2444xxx  than for omeprazole.
in vitro,  xxxd2444xxx  has demonstrated antibacterial activity against up to 113
helicobacter pylori strains isolated from endoscopic biopsies. the minimum
inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (mic50) of h.
pylori were generally within the range of 1 to 1.56 mg/l. comparative mic50
values for other  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors were 12.5 to 16 mg/l for omeprazole and
50 mg/l for pantoprazole.

 xxxd2444xxx  at doses of 1 to 150 mumol/kg has also demonstrated dosedependent gastroprotective properties in response to  xxxd102xxx hcl- and haemorrhagic shock-induced gastric mucosal damage in an in vivo study in wistar rats.
pharmacokinetic
properties

 xxxd2444xxx  is rapidly and completely absorbed, and displays linear kinetics
over a dose range of 15 to 60mg. maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) of 0.75
to 1.15 mg/l were reached 1.5 to 2.2 hours after administration of a single dose
of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg. administration with food reduces both cmax and area under
the plasma concentration-time-curve (auc) by 50% and delays the time to reach
cmax by 3.5 to 3.7 hours. like all  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors,  xxxd2444xxx  is highly
protein bound (97%), rapidly metabolised in the liver by cytochrome p450 and
has negligible renal clearance.  xxxd2444xxx  is also converted to its active metabolites in the gastric parietal cells. the elimination half-life (t1⁄2) of  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg is approximately 0.9 to 1.6 hours. after a single oral dose of [14c] xxxd2444xxx  one-third was excreted in the urine and two-thirds in the faeces.
in patients with renal impairment, t1⁄2 and auc were decreased after administration of  xxxd2444xxx  60mg. auc at steady state and t1⁄2 were increased in
patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. in elderly patients t1⁄2 and
auc may be prolonged and clearance may be reduced. in one study, cmax, auc
and t1⁄2 were increased after multiple doses of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg in patients with
gord compared with healthy volunteers.
coadministration of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg, amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin
500mg twice daily significantly prolongs t1⁄2 and increases the auc of  xxxd2444xxx  while increasing the cmax, auc12 and tmax of clarithromycin. the cmax
of paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1g was increased and the tmax was reduced when
coadministered with  xxxd2444xxx  30mg. there were no clinically significant
interactions when  xxxd2444xxx  30mg was coadministered with the following
agents:  xxxd3150xxx  300mg twice daily, warfarin, indomethacin, ibuprofen,
prednisolone, diazepam or terfenadine.  xxxd2444xxx  60mg had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous phenytoin, oral propranolol or theophylline, and multiple dose  xxxd2444xxx  60mg plus metronidazole 1g
did not effect the pharmacokinetic properties of either agent.

clinical efficacy

peptic ulcer disease
eradication therapy combining a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor and two antimicrobial
agents is currently the most effective therapy, curing peptic ulcer disease and
preventing ulcer recurrence in the majority of patients.
in well designed studies which included ≥300 patients,  xxxd2444xxx -based
triple therapy regimens were equivalent to omeprazole- and  xxxd3070xxx -based
regimens with respect to h. pylori eradication rates. eradication rates for
 xxxd2444xxx  30mg plus amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 250 or 500mg twice
daily ranged from 72 to 92% compared with 62 to 93% for omeprazole 20mg
combined with amoxicillin 750mg or 1g and clarithromycin 250 or 500mg twice
daily, and 87 and 86% for  xxxd3070xxx  10 or 20mg twice daily, amoxicillin 500mg
3 times daily and clarithromycin 200mg twice daily. when  xxxd2444xxx  30mg
or omeprazole 20mg was combined with clarithromycin 250mg and metronidazole 400mg twice daily, eradication rates of >87% were observed. a higher eradication rate was observed with a two-week triple  xxxd2444xxx -based regimen than
a one-week regimen in a subgroup of 71 patients from a larger study but this
difference was not significant.

1805

30mg or omeprazole 20mg plus amoxicillin 1g and/or clarithromycin 250 or
500mg and/or metronidazole 400mg administered twice daily generally show
ulcer healing rates of >80%. preliminary results obtained in a subgroup of patients
indicate a greater incidence of ulcer healing was observed with a two-week
 xxxd2444xxx -based triple therapy regimen although this was not significantly
different compared with a one-week regimen.
there are few available data on the efficacy of eradication regimens in elderly
patients and in children.  xxxd2444xxx -based triple therapy regimens including a
combination of amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole were equally effective in elderly patients, with eradication rates in the order of 80%. similar eradication rates were observed after one weeks treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  30mg,
omeprazole 20mg or pantoprazole 40mg all administered twice daily in combination with amoxicillin 1g twice daily and metronidazole 250mg 4 times daily
for 1 week.
the optimal treatment regimen in children has not been established. based on
preliminary data in children and adolescents (2 to 18 years) triple therapy regimens using a  xxxd2444xxx  dosage of >0.75 mg/kg/day combined with amoxicillin and clarithromycin had the highest eradication rates (87 and 92% in two
trials), and ulcer healing was evident in 92% of children.
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
for short-term treatment of patients with gord,  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 or 60
mg/day was significantly more effective in healing oesophagitis than placebo,
ranitidine 300 or 600 mg/day or  xxxd1708xxx  20mg twice daily.  xxxd2444xxx  also
reduced the percentage of days and nights with heartburn compared with ranitidine and placebo; the latter comparison was significantly in favour of  xxxd2444xxx .
 xxxd2444xxx  and pantoprazole were equivalent in terms of endoscopically confirmed healing, and omeprazole and pantoprazole provided similar symptom relief to  xxxd2444xxx  therapy in terms of the proportion of patients free of heartburn.
however, in comparison with omeprazole, ranitidine and  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd2444xxx 
provided significantly greater relief from heartburn.
in patients with healed oesophagitis,  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day administered as maintenance therapy prevented recurrence. however, data from 12month studies offer no firm consensus on the most effective  xxxd2444xxx  dosage
for maintenance treatment.
oesophagitis recurrence rates were <10% for both  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day
and omeprazole 20 mg/day after 12 months’ maintenance therapy. the lower
dosage of  xxxd2444xxx  15mg once daily was significantly more effective than
omeprazole 10mg once daily in preventing relapse.
h. pylori status may affect the relapse rate in patients with gord. in a
randomised trial, all patients received  xxxd2444xxx  30mg daily for 10 days and
h. pylori-positive patients also received amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 10
days then all patients received  xxxd2444xxx  30mg for 8 weeks. after 6 months of
follow-up h. pylori-positive patients had a significantly faster relapse rate compared with either patients who had successful eradication therapy or patients who
were h. pylori-negative. severity of oesophagitis also significantly affected the
relapse rate.
 xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30mg once daily for 8 to 12 weeks healed erosive gord
in 27 children aged 1 to 12 years enrolled in a noncomparative trial. in a
randomised double-blind trial in 63 children,  xxxd2444xxx  15mg relieved symp© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

toms in only 69% of patients.  xxxd2444xxx  1.3 to 1.5 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks
resulted in endoscopically confirmed healing in 75% of children (n = 12) after
treatment failure with ranitidine.
nsaid-related ulcers
in patients with nsaid-related gastric ulcers  xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30 mg/day
was associated with a significantly higher incidence of ulcer healing, a lower
incidence of daytime and night-time abdominal pain and a lower severity of dayor night-time abdominal pain and less antacid use per day than ranitidine 150mg
twice daily. in over 2400 patients enrolled in randomised double-blind trials
overall ulcer healing rates ranged from 64 to 76% with both dosages of  xxxd2444xxx  compared with 47 to 53% for ranitidine recipients.
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day reduced ulcer relapse, irrespective of h. pylori status,
in 61 patients with healed ulcers who continued to take naproxen 750 mg/day.
an approximately 5-fold difference in relapse rates was noted between
 xxxd2444xxx  who had undergone h. pylori eradication and placebo recipients.
in a randomised double-blind study in 455 evaluable patients reported as an
abstract,  xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30 mg/day was as effective as misoprostol 200mug
four times daily in preventing nsaid-related ulcers.
acid-related dyspepsia
in 562 patients with acid-related dyspepsia,  xxxd2444xxx  15mg once daily
provided significantly greater symptom relief (daytime heartburn and epigastric
pain) compared with omeprazole 10mg once daily after 2 weeks of treatment in
a randomised double-blind study; however, both agents were similarly effective
at 4 weeks in an intention-to-treat analysis. additional analyses suggest an interaction between the type of dyspepsia and treatment; at week 4  xxxd2444xxx  was
more likely to provide symptom relief for patients with ulcer-like dyspepsia and
omeprazole was more likely to be effective for those with reflux-like dyspepsia.
a per-protocol analysis in 283 patients with acid-related dyspepsia showed
that  xxxd2444xxx  30mg once daily was significantly more effective than ranitidine 150mg twice daily in improving dyspepsia symptoms including freedom from
daytime and night-time heartburn and night-time epigastric pain after 4 weeks of
treatment in a randomised study.
data from two abstracts also confirm that  xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30mg are superior in efficacy to placebo in providing symptomatic relief from dyspepsia in
patients with nonulcer dyspepsia.
tolerability profile

in the us, the uk and the netherlands, a review of clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance have evaluated the tolerability profile of  xxxd2444xxx  in over 30 000
patients with gord, gastric or duodenal ulcers, dyspepsia, barrett’s oesophagus
or zollinger-ellison syndrome. the most commonly reported adverse events,
with  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 and 60 mg/day therapy in patients with gord or gastric
or duodenal ulcer, were diarrhoea, which appears to be dose dependent, nausea,
headache and abdominal pain.
a us review of clinical trials of ≤2 months’ duration found no significant
differences between  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 or 60 mg/day and omeprazole 20 mg/day
with respect to headache, diarrhoea and nausea; these adverse events occurred
with a frequency of ≤5%.
in 8-week trials in patients with gord, nsaid-related gastric ulcers and
acid-related dyspepsia  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day were generally associated
with a similar incidence of adverse events compared with ranitidine 300 or 600

mg/day. in patients with gord, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and
headache were most commonly reported; diarrhoea was the most frequently reported adverse event in patients with an nsaid-related ulcer.
similar adverse events were observed in trials of 1 to 4 years’ duration in
patients with gord, peptic ulcer, gastritis or dyspepsia. however, the frequency
of adverse events such as diarrhoea, headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness and
abdominal pain was generally higher (≤10%) in longer-term trials. a similar type
and frequency of events was observed in a 1-year trial in patients with duodenal
ulcer administered  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day or ranitidine 150 mg/day.
the most commonly reported adverse events were diarrhoea, headache and
taste disturbance when  xxxd2444xxx  was administered in combination with
amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole. omeprazole-based triple therapy
was generally similar in the type and frequency of adverse events observed.
notably,  xxxd2444xxx  in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin had
the highest incidence of diarrhoea, while  xxxd2444xxx  plus clarithromycin and
metronidazole had the lowest.
dosage and
administration

dosage recommendations for  xxxd2444xxx  differ between countries. in brief, for
the eradication of h. pylori us guidelines recommend a 10- or 14-day regimen
consisting of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg, amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg twice
daily. in the uk, prescribing recommendations state that eradication therapy
should consist of a twice-daily regimen of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg for 1 week plus
two of either amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500mg or metronidazole 400mg for
1 week. maintenance therapy of 15 mg/day is recommended in both countries for
patients with persistent duodenal ulcer symptoms.
for short-term treatment of gord, 30 mg/day for 4 to 8 weeks is recommended in the uk; in the us treatment should be initiated with 15 mg/day for
up to 8 weeks and this dosage may be increased to 30 mg/day for patients with
erosive oesophagitis.  xxxd2444xxx  15 mg/day is recommended for maintenance
treatment to prevent recurrence in patients with healed gord; this dosage may
be increased to 30 mg/day in the uk.
us guidelines recommend administration of  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day for 8
weeks for the treatment of nsaid-related ulcers; according to uk guidelines
 xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30 mg/day should be administered for 4 to 8 weeks. in the us,
 xxxd2444xxx  15 mg/day for up to 12 weeks is recommended as prophylactic
treatment in patients at risk of developing nsaid-related ulcers.  xxxd2444xxx 
15 to 30 mg/day may be administered to these patients according to uk guidelines.
at present there are no us recommendations for the treatment of acid-related
dyspepsia. the uk prescribing guidelines recommend 2 to 4 weeks’ treatment
with  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30 mg/day as required.
of note,  xxxd2444xxx  should be taken before meals to avoid a reduction in the
rate and extent of absorption. although  xxxd2444xxx  is usually administered once
daily, it may be administered in two divided doses in the morning and evening
in patients receiving ≥120mg daily.
dosage adjustment of  xxxd2444xxx  is not necessary in elderly patients or patients with mild renal or hepatic impairment, although, in patients with severe
hepatic dysfunction a dosage reduction should be considered. there are currently
no recommendations available concerning the use of  xxxd2444xxx  in children.

1.  xxxd2444xxx  in the management of
acid-related disorders

 xxxd2444xxx  is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion and is used clinically in the management of
acid-related disorders.  xxxd2444xxx  has been reviewed previously in drugs by barradell et al.[1]
spencer and faulds[2] and langtry and wilde.[3]
since the previous reviews, a large number of studies have been published on the role of  xxxd2444xxx 
in combination with antimicrobial therapy in the
eradication of helicobacter pylori. the current review also presents recently published data on the
use of  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy in the treatment
of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord),
acid-related dyspepsia and nsaid-associated gastric ulcers.  xxxd2444xxx  is also being investigated
in comparison with ranitidine or  xxxd3252xxx  for its
efficacy as a prophylactic agent in the prevention
of acid-related disorders (gastroduodenal lesions,
stress ulcers) in patients undergoing elective surgery or those who are critically ill.[4-6] however, a
detailed discussion of its use in these patients is
beyond the scope of this review.
2. pharmacodynamic properties

the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2444xxx 
have been reviewed extensively in drugs by barradell
et al.[1] spencer and faulds[2] and langtry and wilde.[3]
an overview of the pharmacodynamic profile of
 xxxd2444xxx  is outlined in table i.
2.1 mechanism of acid suppression

briefly,  xxxd2444xxx  inhibits basal and stimulated
gastric acid secretion via selective inhibition of the
 xxxg215xxx  of the gastric parietal cell.[3,13-15] the
active sulphenamide metabolites of  xxxd2444xxx 
inactivate h+, k+-atpase, the enzyme catalysing
the final step in the gastric acid secretion pathway.[2,13,15]
in healthy volunteers enrolled in randomised,
crossover studies, single doses of  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg provided faster control of intragastric acidity
than pantoprazole 40mg,[16]  xxxd3070xxx  20mg[17]
and omeprazole 20[18] and 40mg.[16] however,
 xxxd2444xxx  30mg was equivalent to omeprazole

matheson & jarvis

40mg (ph 3.2 vs 3.0, respectively)[16] in terms of
mean intragastric 24-hour ph.[16]
when these agents were administered as multiple doses the duration of increased intragastric ph
level above ph 3 or 4 was significantly longer for
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day versus  xxxd2444xxx  15
mg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day and omeprazole
20 mg/day (p ≤ 0.05).[19,20] mean intragastric 24hour ph was significantly higher with  xxxd2444xxx 
30 mg/day than pantoprazole 40 mg/day (ph 4.15
vs 3.91, p < 0.05),[20]  xxxd2444xxx  15 mg/day (4.53
vs 3.97, p ≤ 0.05) and omeprazole 20 mg/day (4.53
vs 4.02, p < 0.05).[19]  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day for
5 days achieved faster control of intragastric acidity (within the first 5 hours of administration) than
 xxxd3070xxx  20 mg/day; with significant differences noted on days 1 and 5 (p < 0.001).[17]
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day significantly increased
mean 24-hour gastric ph values compared with
ranitidine 150mg 4 times daily for 5 days (ph 4.53
vs 3.59, p ≤ 0.05) in a double-blind, randomised
crossover study in healthy volunteers.[19] the percentage of time for which intragastric ph was
maintained above 4 was significantly greater for
 xxxd2444xxx  (64%) than for ranitidine (38%, p ≤
0.05).[19]
in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study
in 14 patients with erosive oesophagitis and gord,
5-day treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day or
omeprazole 20 mg/day increased median daytime
(ph 4.95 and 4.54, respectively) and night-time
(4.2 and 3.68) intragastric ph.[21] on day 5 of treatment the total time spent with a mean oesophageal
ph value of <4 was significantly shorter for  xxxd2444xxx  (1.9%) than for omeprazole (4.8%, p =
0.002).[21]
2.2 antibacterial activity

in vitro,  xxxd2444xxx  has antibacterial activity
against up to 113 h. pylori strains isolated from
endoscopic biopsies.[9,22-27] the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth
of 50% of h. pylori (mic50) varied between studies
but were generally within the range of 1 to 1.56 mg/l,
respectively.[9,23,27] comparatively, mic50 values

1809

table i. overview of pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2444xxx [2,3,7-12]
mechanism of acid suppression
active metabolites inactivate the h+/k+ atpase  xxxg215xxx  in gastric parietal cells[2,3]
provides dose-related inhibition of gastric acid secretion (over the range of 15 to 60mg)[3]
a single dose of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg inhibits acid secretion by approximately 80 to 97%[2]
inhibits both daytime and night-time acid secretion[2]
in healthy volunteers both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion were inhibited by single and multiple doses of  xxxd2444xxx [2]
multiple dose  xxxd2444xxx  increases intragastric ph, and therefore it potentially increases serum gastrin levels[2]
pepsin secretion was also inhibited in healthy volunteers, although to a lesser extent[2]
antibacterial activity
 xxxd2444xxx  and its metabolites have in vitro antibacterial activity against helicobacter pylori[2,3,9]
 xxxd2444xxx  at concentrations of ≥30 mug/ml has more potent bactericidal activity than either omeprazole >30 mug/ml or pantaprazole >100
mug/ml[3]
in vitro  xxxd2444xxx  has little effect against other common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria[2]
h. pylori urease, an important virulence factor, is also inhibited by  xxxd2444xxx  in vitro[2]
other effects
increases serum gastrin levels relative to baseline in short- and long-term clinical trials; serum gastrin levels reach a plateau after 1 to 2
months of treatment[2]
may also protect the mucosa from injury by increasing mucosal oxygenation[2]
in vivo studies in rats show that  xxxd2444xxx  reduced mucosal injury evoked by  xxxd102xxx hcl (ed50 24.3 mumol/kg) or haemorrhagic shock
(ed50 38.9 mumol/kg) in a dose-dependent manner which is independent of its inhibition of acid secretion (ed50 9.8 mumol/kg)[7]
pretreatment with  xxxd2444xxx  30 or 60 mg/day for 4 or 7 days protects against aspirin-induced mucosal injury in healthy volunteers[2]
in patients with gord 12-month treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day reduced hyperplasia of the basal cell layer and elongation
of the papillae in addition ulcer and erosion healing[12]
12-month treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day resulted in hypertrophy of the gastric parietal cells similar to that seen with
omeprazole 20 mg/day in patients with gord; this was reversed after discontinuation of treatment[10]
short-term treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day resulted in inhibition of inflammatory responses in healthy volunteers, namely a
reduced number of monocytes and cells expressing the icam-1 adhesion molecule[8]
in healthy volunteers  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day administered for 1 week produced a significant decrease in stroke volume and therefore
cardiac output up to 6 hours after the initial dose; this effect was not evident at 1 week[11]
ed50 = dose of  xxxd2444xxx  required to produce 50% of its maximal inhibitory effects; gord = gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

for other  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors ranged from 12.5
to 16 mg/l for omeprazole,[9,23] and 50 mg/l for
pantoprazole.[9] ranitidine, a histamine h2-receptor
antagonist, was inactive in vitro.[23] as expected
mic50 values (< 0.5 mg/l) for macrolide antimicrobials (clarithromycin, azithromycin,  xxxd3150xxx ) were lower than those seen with proton
pump inhibitors; in this study the comparative mic
value for  xxxd2444xxx  was 1 mg/l.[22]
dual therapies combining a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor and an antibiotic are used clinically to eradicate h. pylori infection.[22,25,26] neither agent administered alone appears to be clinically effective
for eradicating h. pylori infection. studies have
compared the synergistic activity of combinations
of either  xxxd2444xxx  or omeprazole with clarithromycin, azithromycin or  xxxd3150xxx  by various

methodologies including time-kill studies,[22] antimicrobial interactions[25] and bactericidal assays.[26] combined  xxxd2444xxx  and clarithromycin,  xxxd3150xxx  or azithromycin demonstrated
additive and synergistic effects against h. pylori in
vitro.[22] data suggest that  xxxd2444xxx  combined
with either  xxxd3150xxx  or azithromycin acted
synergistically on a higher percentage of strains
(82 and 60%, respectively) than omeprazole combined with either agent (39 and 24%, significance
not reported);[25] however, combined  xxxd2444xxx /
 xxxd3150xxx  was significantly more synergistic
than  xxxd2444xxx /azithromycin (p = 0.002).[25]
2.3 gastroprotective effects

the potential gastroprotective effect of  xxxd2444xxx  has been evaluated in an in vivo study in
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

1810

wistar rats.[7]  xxxd2444xxx  1 to 150 mumol/kg,
ranitidine 80 mumol/kg or vehicle were administered
via intraduodenal or intraperitoneal injection 30
minutes (or 48, 24 and 1 hour for ranitidine) prior
to gastric mucosal damage induced by either ethanolhcl or haemorrhagic shock.  xxxd2444xxx  reduced
damage to the gastric mucosa in a dose-dependent
manner; the dose required to inhibit 50% of gastric
injury (ed50) was 24.3 mumol/kg for  xxxd102xxx hcl–
induced injury or 38.8 mumol/kg for haemorrhagic
shock-induced injury. rats preadministered ranitidine did not differ from animals administered vehicle
with regard to the extent of mucosal damage. the
authors interpretation was that the gastroprotective
effect of  xxxd2444xxx  may be more closely related
to an enhancement of the gastric mucosal barrier
than a reduction of acid secretion, although the data
do not exclude the effect simply being via acid inhibition.[7]
3. pharmacokinetic properties

table ii presents a brief overview of the pharmacokinetic properties and drug interactions of
 xxxd2444xxx .
 xxxd2444xxx  is rapidly and completely absorbed,
and displays linear increases in plasma concentrations over a dose range of 15 to 60mg.[3,29] pharmacokinetic variables for multiple dose  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day are similar to those for single
dose  xxxd2444xxx  30mg. like all  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors,  xxxd2444xxx  is highly protein bound, rapidly metabolised in the liver and has negligible renal clearance.[28]  xxxd2444xxx  is converted to its
active metabolites in the gastric parietal cells. its
short elimination half-life, less than 2 hours, does
not reflect its duration of suppression of gastric
acid secretion, since its acid inhibitory effect lasts
for more than 24 hours.[29]
of note, the maximum plasma concentration
(1343 vs 765 mug/l), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) [3458 vs 1350 mugh/l]
and elimination half-life (t1⁄2) [1.6 vs 0.9 hours]
were increased in 16 patients with grade 2 or 3
reflux oesophagitis after multiple administration of
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day relative to 8 healthy male

matheson & jarvis

volunteers.[30] the patient group included patients
aged up to 65 years, which may mean these results
are attributable to decreased clearance in some patients; however a change in pharmacokinetic parameters relative to disease status can not be ruled
out. while various pharmacokinetic parameters are
altered in elderly patients and those with renal or
hepatic impairment (table ii), dosage adjustment
need only be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment (section 6).
4. clinical efficacy

the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  in acid-related disorders has been reviewed previously in drugs by
barradell et al.[1] langtry and wilde[3] and spencer
and faulds.[2] this section focuses on clinical trials
published since 1997.
4.1 peptic ulcer disease

h. pylori is the primary cause of peptic ulcer
disease;[3,40-42] >90% of patients with a duodenal
ulcer are infected with h. pylori.[42] while antisecretory therapy effectively heals duodenal ulcers, relapse rates approach 80% 6 months after
discontinuation of therapy.[41] eradication of h.
pylori infection has been shown to cure duodenal
ulcers and prevent relapse in the majority of patients.[42]
currently the most effective therapy includes a
combination of a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor (such as
 xxxd2444xxx , omeprazole,  xxxd3070xxx , pantoprazole or esomeprazole) and two antimicrobial
agents (amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole).[43] gastric acid inhibition by the proton
pump inhibitor allows acid-sensitive antibiotics to
reach the bacteria, and it may also directly affect
h. pylori (section 2.2).[44]
4.1.1  xxxd2444xxx  in the eradication of
helicobacter pylori

the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  in the eradication
of h. pylori has been evaluated in a large number
of trials; therefore, this section includes randomised studies which evaluated ≥300 patients.

also more effective than either  xxxd2444xxx  30mg
or omeprazole 20mg combined with amoxicillin
and metronidazole (table iii).[42]
the highest dosage of each  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor corresponded with the highest eradication
rates; eradication rates for  xxxd2444xxx  30mg plus
amoxicillin and clarithromycin ranged from 72 to
92% and were generally ≥82% (table iii). similarly, the eradication rates for omeprazole 20mg
combined with amoxicillin and clarithromycin
ranged from 62 to 93% (table iii). likewise, eradication rates for the  xxxd3070xxx  10 or 20mg,
amoxicillin and clarithromycin regimens were 87
and 86% (table iii).[45] in combination with clarithromycin and metronidazole, eradication rates remained above 87% for both  xxxd2444xxx  30mg and
omeprazole 20mg [table iii].[42,46]
similar eradication rates were seen for the 1and 2-week treatment regimens;  xxxd2444xxx

4.1.2 efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  on ulcer healing
ulcer healing

in clinical trials in patients with peptic ulcer disease the primary focus has become the eradication
of h. pylori infection. therefore, there are few data
evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx -based triple therapy[40,50,53] with ulcer healing as the primary endpoint. however, a relatively high rate of
ulcer healing can be expected with lansoprazolebased triple therapy regimens; ≥90% ulcer healing
occurred with 65% of 34 regimens evaluated in a
previous review in drugs.[3]
triple therapy regimens generally showed similar efficacy in terms of ulcer healing after 1 week
of treatment with various combinations of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg or omeprazole 20mg plus amoxicillin 1g and/or clarithromycin 250mg and/or metdrugs 2001; 61 (12)

ronidazole 400mg administered twice daily to 262
patients with ulcers of between 5 and 10mm in diameter in a randomised, nonblind, multicentre
trial.[53] after 4 weeks, ulcer healing rates according to an intention-to-treat analysis were 86% for
 xxxd2444xxx /amoxicillin/clarithromycin, 81% for
 xxxd2444xxx /amoxicillin/metronidazole and 80%
for  xxxd2444xxx /clarithromycin/metronidazole.
this compared favourably with an 80% healing rate
with the omeprazole/amoxicillin/metronidazole
regimen. these results are supported by results
from a randomised, nonblind, multicentre comparative trial where ulcer healing rates 4 to 6 weeks
after treatment with  xxxd2444xxx /amoxicillin/clarithromycin and omeprazole/amoxicillin/clarithromycin were also >80% (fig. 1; see table iii for dosage details).[40]
data from a subgroup of patients enrolled in a
randomised, nonblind clinical trial suggest 2week therapy with a  xxxd2444xxx /amoxicillin/
clarithromycin regimen (including clarithromycin
500mg) results in a greater, but not significant, incidence of ulcer healing than 1-week therapy (91
vs 81%). as expected, ulcer healing occurred significantly more frequently in patients who were
cured of h. pylori infection compared with patients
with persistent infection (91 vs 69%, p = 0.04).[50]
4.1.3 efficacy in children

the optimal regimen for the treatment of h.
pylori infection in children has yet to be determined. the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx -based triple
therapies in children and adolescents aged 2 to 18
years has been described in several small nonrandomised studies.[54-57] in general, the efficacy
was greatest in regimens in which the dosage of
 xxxd2444xxx  was >0.75 mg/kg twice daily.[54,57]
eradication rates for  xxxd2444xxx  in combination
with amoxicillin and clarithromycin (at similar
maximum dosages to those used in adults) were 87
and 92%;[54,57] coupled with ulcer healing in 92%
of children and adolescents.[54]

toms.[58] mucosal damage, which is primarily related to prolonged exposure of the oesophageal mucosa to acid and pepsin, is the primary pathological
consequence.[59] therefore, the pharmacological
rationale in the treatment of gord is the reduction
of oesophageal exposure to acid via the suppression
of daytime, night-time and meal-stimulated gastric
acid secretion by using antisecretory drugs such as
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitors ( xxxd2444xxx ) or histamine
h2-receptor antagonists (ranitidine).[59] the most
common subgroup of patients have no oesophageal
erosion or ulceration (endoscopy negative), and diagnosis relies primarily on analysis of symptoms.[58]
 xxxd2444xxx  has been evaluated for its efficacy
in both short- and long-term treatment of gord.
4.2.1 short-term treatment

in the short-term treatment of patients with
gord,  xxxd2444xxx  has been evaluated in comparison with placebo,[59,60] omeprazole,[61-63] pantoprazole,[64] ranitidine[65-67] and  xxxd1708xxx [68,69] in
randomised, multicentre, double-blind[61,62,64-68,70]
or nonblind[69] trials of 4 to 8 weeks’ duration.
patients were eligible for inclusion if they had
endoscopically investigated gord which was erosive[60-62,65,69,70] or nonerosive.[59,66] the severity
of oesophagitis varied between the trials: inclusion
criteria in 4 studies specified oesophagitis severity
of grade 0 to 1[59] or ≥ grade 2,[60,65] and 2 studies
included only patients with severe symptomatic
gord.[63,68] the remaining studies were published as abstracts and the severity of oesophagitis was
not specified.[61,62,64,66,67,69]
exclusion criteria generally included serious or
significant illness including barrett’s oesophagus
and zollinger-ellison syndrome, nsaid use or a
history of alcohol or drug abuse.[59,60,65]
the primary endpoints were the proportion of
patients with endoscopically confirmed healing of
oesophagitis,[60,64,65,67,69] or symptom relief measured using patient diary cards,[59,62,63,66] heartburn
score[68] or a 4-point likert scale.[61]
treatment generally continued for the duration
of the study; however, in one study treatment was
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

 xxxd2444xxx : an update

stopped in patients with healed oesophagitis confirmed via endoscopy.[65]
effects on oesophagitis

a significantly greater proportion of patients
had healed oesophagitis after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 or 60 mg/day than
with placebo, ranitidine 300 or 600 mg/day or
 xxxd1708xxx  20mg twice daily (p < 0.001) [table iv].
endoscopically confirmed healing occurred in
≥78% of  xxxd2444xxx  recipients and <60% of those
receiving placebo, ranitidine or  xxxd1708xxx .[60,65,67,69]
in contrast with placebo[59] and ranitidine,[66]
 xxxd2444xxx  also markedly reduced the percentage
of days and nights with heartburn; in the placebocontrolled trial this difference was significantly in
favour of  xxxd2444xxx  (p < 0.001, table iv).[59]
 xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30mg generally showed
similar efficacy in terms of healing of both erosive[60] and nonerosive[66] oesophagitis and symptom relief (table iv). both doses of  xxxd2444xxx 
were effective in reducing heartburn in patients
with nonerosive gord.[59,66] although in one
study,  xxxd2444xxx  15mg was significantly more
effective than the 30mg dose in reducing the proportion of nights with and severity of heartburn (p
< 0.05); moreover, this trend was apparent after
day 1 of treatment, reaching significance after 8
weeks.[59]
 xxxd2444xxx  30mg and pantoprazole 40mg
were equivalent in terms of healing rates (table
iv).[64] similarly, omeprazole 20mg and pantoprazole 40mg provided similar symptom relief to
 xxxd2444xxx  therapy in terms of the proportion of
patients free of heartburn (table iv).[61,64] however, in comparison with omeprazole, ranitidine
and  xxxd1708xxx ,  xxxd2444xxx  provided significantly
greater relief from heartburn (p < 0.01, table
iv)[62,65,67,68] and there was a tendency towards
greater relief from retrosternal pain and belching
with  xxxd2444xxx  versus ranitidine.[65] in an 8week trial including 3 510 patients,  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg/day provided significantly faster relief from
heartburn than omeprazole 20mg/day; a difference
between the treatment groups was apparent after 1
week (p < 0.0001).[62]

relapse of oesophagitis

in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
8-week trial in 58 patients with endoscopically
confirmed gord, h. pylori status adversely affected the relapse rate.[71] in the eradication phase
all patients received  xxxd2444xxx  30mg twice daily
for 10 days; patients who were h. pylori-positive
also received either amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or placebo. in the subsequent treatment phase all patients [those who
were h. pylori-negative, those successfully cured
(eradication rate was 87%) and placebo recipients]
received 8 weeks of  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/ day treatment. after 6 months of follow-up, h. pylori-positive
patients had a relapse earlier (median of 54 days)
than either patients who had successful eradication
therapy (100 days, p = 0.046) or those who were
h. pylori-negative (110 days, p = 0.018).[71] severity of oesophagitis also significantly affected relapse rate (p = 0.016); no oesophagitis was associated with a relapse rate of 127 days whereas time
to relapse for grade iii and iv oesophagitis was 18
days.
4.2.2 long-term maintenance treatment

because of the chronic relapsing nature of
gord, maintenance therapy is usually indicated
to ensure lesions are healed, to prevent the development of complications and to keep the patient
symptom free.[72]
various  xxxd2444xxx  dosage regimens have
been evaluated as maintenance therapy in patients
with healed gord[72-74] and several trials have
compared the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  with omeprazole.[75,76] patients with grade i to iii[72,76] or
≥grade ii[74,75] gord were included in maintenance studies of 6 or 12 months’ duration. all patients were given 8 to 12 weeks of treatment with
either  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day[72,75-77] or varying
dosage regimens of  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30mg,[73]
and only patients with healed gord were included. the majority of studies were reported in
abstract form.[73,74,76]
exclusion criteria included barrett’s oesophagus, crohn’s disease, peptic ulcer and or other gastrointestinal disease, use of histamine h2-receptor
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

primary efficacy criteria in all studies included
recurrence of oesophagitis assessed via endoscopy;
in one study relapse was defined as either reappearance of grade i or more severe reflux oesophagitis,
and/or the presence of reflux symptoms.[72] symptom relapse was also assessed in two studies.[73,74]
oesophagitis and symptom relapse rates

 xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day administered as
maintenance therapy prevented relapse in patients
with healed oesophagitis (table v).
however, the results comparing various  xxxd2444xxx  regimens are inconclusive. in one 12-month
study  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day was significantly
more effective in preventing recurrence of oesophagitis than  xxxd2444xxx  15 mg/day with twice as
many patients experiencing a relapse on the lower
dosage (p < 0.01) [table v].[72] in a second 12-month
study, however, both dosages of  xxxd2444xxx  were
similar in terms of oesophagitis and symptom re-

lapse rates (table v).[74] furthermore, in a 6-month
study comparing 4 dosage regimens  xxxd2444xxx 
15mg once daily was associated with lower relapse
rates than regimens that used less frequent administration including when used ‘as needed’ in the
evening (table v).[73]
endoscopically confirmed relapse rates were
<10% for both  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day and omeprazole 20 mg/day after 12 months’ maintenance
therapy (table v).[75] at lower dosages  xxxd2444xxx  15mg once daily was significantly more
effective than omeprazole 10mg once daily in preventing recurrence of oesophagitis.[76] of interest
approximately two-thirds of relapsing patients in
the latter study were asymptomatic.[76]
in long-term studies, h. pylori status did not
significantly predict time to relapse (see section
4.2.1); 25% of infected patients relapsed within
200 days versus 300 days in noninfected patients.[72] patients with grade 1 or 2 reflux oesophagitis were given 12 weeks of treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  30mg; healed asymptomatic patients

4.2.3 efficacy in children and adolescents

the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  in 164 children and
adolescents with erosive or nonerosive gord has
been determined in two clinical trials published as
abstracts,[78,79] and one fully published noncomparative study.[80] children and adolescents received  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30mg once daily (dosage
was based on bodyweight in one study)[79] for a
period of 5 days[78] or 8 weeks (those who were not
healed at 8 weeks were allowed a further 4 weeks
of treatment).[79] 35 children with gord refractory to ranitidine (8 to 10 mg/kg administered for
12 weeks) were given 12 weeks of treatment with
 xxxd2444xxx  7.5, 15 or 30 mg/day (depending on
bodyweight).[80]
endoscopy at 8 to 12 weeks showed a 100%
healing rate in 27 children aged 1 to 12 years with
erosive gord in one noncomparative study.[79]
overall symptom relief in 66 children with erosive
or nonerosive gord was 76% and significantly
fewer days were spent with gord symptoms compared with baseline (55 vs 80%; p < 0.001).[79] in
63 children and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years
enrolled in a randomised, double-blind study, 5days’ treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30mg relieved symptoms in 69 and 74% of patients, respectively.[78]
in children aged 3 to 15 years given  xxxd2444xxx  after treatment failure with ranitidine, 12 patients responded to the initial dosage of the drug
(1.3 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) and at 12 weeks healing was
obtained in 75% of these children.[80] lower doses
were less effective.

4.3 nsaid-related ulcers

the use of nsaid therapy is often associated
with gastrointestinal disorders ranging from dyspepsia and heartburn to damage of the gastroduodenal mucosa which includes erosion, ulceration, bleeding and perforation.[81] nsaid use can
impair the normal mucosal defence against damage
and allow gastric acid to cause mucosal injury.[82]
the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30 mg/day
has been evaluated in comparison with ranitidine
150mg twice daily in healing nsaid-related endoscopically and biopsy confirmed nonmalignant
gastric ulcers ≥5mm in diameter in patients receiving stable doses of nsaids ≥1 month prior to initiation of treatment (table vi).
while the majority of patients had gastric ulcers, several studies also included patients with coexisting duodenal ulcers[81,83,86] or gord.[81] all
studies are published as abstracts with the exception of one fully published study which included
patients with arthritis who were receiving either
ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin or diclofenac.[81]
h. pylori status was confirmed prior to treatment initiation in two studies.[81,85] ulcer healing
was assessed by endoscopy after 8 weeks of treatment. nsaid use was continued for the duration
of treatment in all studies.
4.3.1 effects on ulcer healing

with a significantly higher incidence of ulcer healing than ranitidine 150mg twice daily regardless of
h. pylori status (p < 0.05) [table vi] in randomised,
double-blind multicentre trials.[81,83-86] in over
2400 patients overall ulcer healing rates ranged
from 64 to 76% with both dosages of  xxxd2444xxx 
compared with 47 to 53% for ranitidine recipients.
compared with ranitidine a lower incidence of
daytime and night-time abdominal pain and a
lower severity of day- or night-time abdominal
pain was reported with  xxxd2444xxx  in 2 studies[81,84] reaching statistical significance in 1 study
(p < 0.05).[84] antacid use per day was also significantly lower with  xxxd2444xxx  in one study (p <
0.05).[81]

4.3.2 prevention of ulcer relapse

in a randomised study in 61 patients with healed
ulcers who were receiving naproxen 250mg 3
times daily, the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day
in the prevention of ulcer relapse was evaluated in
comparison with placebo.[87] one group of patients
had h. pylori eradication ( xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day,
amoxicillin 1 g/day and  xxxd1713xxx /day)
prior to initiation of treatment, a second group of
patients were h. pylori-free. endoscopy was performed after 2 months of treatment to assess the
relapse of peptic ulcers.
 xxxd2444xxx  reduced the relapse of peptic ulcers irrespective of h. pylori status. after 2 months
of treatment the incidence of peptic ulcers >5mm
in diameter was 9.1% in  xxxd2444xxx  recipients
who had undergone h. pylori eradication (p < 0.01
vs placebo recipients who had eradicated h. pylori), 5.6% for  xxxd2444xxx  recipients who were
h. pylori-free and 42.9% for placebo recipients in
whom h. pylori had been eradicated.[87]

inhibitor celecoxib 200 to 400 mg/day in the prevention of nsaid-related ulcer recurrence in 115
patients receiving naproxen 500 to 700 mg/day.[88]
after the eradication of h. pylori and 6 months of
preventative treatment,  xxxd2444xxx  and celecoxib
were equally effective in reducing the risk of ulcer
complications in at risk patients receiving longterm nsaid therapy. 3.5% of  xxxd2444xxx  recipients had either perforations or complicated and
symptomatic ulcers compared with 3.4 and 5.2%,
respectively of celecoxib recipients.[88]
4.3.3 prophylactic treatment

in a randomised, double-blind multicentre trial
reported as an abstract,  xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30
mg/day was compared with misoprostol 200mug 4
times daily for its efficacy in the prevention of
nsaid-related ulcers in 455 evaluable patients.[83]
after 12 weeks of treatment there were no significant differences in the prevention rate, as confirmed by endoscopy, between either dose of
 xxxd2444xxx  or misoprostol (fig. 2).[83]

4.4 acid-related dyspepsia

a number of patients have dyspepsia which is
thought to be acid-related and which responds to
acid-suppressing agents; this may be termed acidrelated, nonulcer or functional dyspepsia and generally requires long-term intermittent rather than
continuous maintenance treatment.[89]
two randomised, double-blind, multicentre uk
studies have evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx 
15[89] or 30mg[90] once daily versus ranitidine
150mg twice daily[90] or omeprazole 10mg once
daily[89] in relieving heartburn and epigastric pain
in over 800 patients with acid-related dyspepsia.[89,90] the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  15[91,92] or
30mg[92] once daily has also been evaluated in
comparison with placebo in two randomised multicentre us studies[92] and a 269-patient study,[91]
both of which were published as abstracts.
patients with persistent mild heartburn or epigastric pain on at least 4 of the 7 days prior to treatment initiation were included in the trials. [89,90]
exclusion criteria included severe dyspeptic symptoms,[89] gastric or oesophageal carcinoma, gord,
peptic ulcer disease, disordered gut motility, symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and history of

nsaid, corticosteroid or anticoagulant use 1 month
prior to study entry.[89,90,92]
primary efficacy variables were complete
symptom relief at 2 weeks evaluated by the investigator[89] and/or by the visual analogue scale (vas
score of <20 on a scale of 0 to 100 measuring the
severity of epigastric or retrosternal pain),[91] the
investigators’ assessment of symptom severity at
baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks, patients’ daily evaluation of symptom severity and antacid use.[90]
one study evaluated complete symptom relief after
8 weeks of treatment.[92]
4.4.1 symptom relief

in 562 patients, intention-to-treat analysis
showed that  xxxd2444xxx  15mg once daily provided significantly greater symptom relief compared with omeprazole 10mg once daily after 2
weeks of treatment (53 vs 41% of patients were
symptom free, p = 0.007). [89] at 4 weeks both
treatments were similar with 59 vs 51% of patients
being symptom free, respectively. in terms of individual symptoms, at 2 weeks  xxxd2444xxx  significantly improved the symptoms of daytime heartburn (70 vs 58% for omeprazole, p = 0.01) and
daytime epigastric pain (63 vs 46%, p = 0.001). a
greater number of  xxxd2444xxx  recipients were
free of heartburn and epigastric pain at 4 weeks but
this difference was not statistically significant (59
vs 51% of patients symptom free).
additional analyses suggest an interaction between the type of dyspepsia and treatment; at week
4  xxxd2444xxx  was more likely to provide symptom relief for patients with ulcer-like dyspepsia
than those with reflux-like dyspepsia (p = 0.01).[89]
omeprazole was more likely to be effective in patients with reflux-like symptoms. a significantly
greater proportion of omeprazole recipients required antacids (58 vs 49% for  xxxd2444xxx , p =
0.035) and the mean number of tablets taken between week 2 and week 4 was also higher (9.8 vs
8, p = 0.033).[89]
 xxxd2444xxx  30mg once daily was significantly (p = 0.001) more effective than ranitidine
150mg twice daily in improving dyspepsia symptoms after 2 (55 vs 33% of patients were symptom

free) and 4 (69 vs 44%) weeks of treatment in 283
patients according to a per protocol analysis.[90] in
addition, there was a significantly larger improvement in the severity of primary symptoms with
 xxxd2444xxx  than with ranitidine at 2 (p = 0.009)
and 4 weeks (p = 0.004). at both 2 and 4 weeks a
significantly greater proportion of patients were
free of daytime heartburn with  xxxd2444xxx  treatment than with ranitidine (80 vs 55% at 4 weeks, p
= 0.001). likewise at 4 weeks the percentage of
patients who were free from night-time heartburn
(83 vs 64%, p = 0.003) and night-time epigastric
pain (81 vs 65%, p = 0.01) was significantly greater
with  xxxd2444xxx  than with ranitidine.[90] 12.9 antacid tablets were consumed by ranitidine recipients
during weeks 3 and 4 of the study compared with
6.5 for  xxxd2444xxx  recipients (p = 0.0001).
 xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30mg once daily was more
effective than placebo in providing symptomatic
relief from dyspepsia;[91,92] these differences
reached significance (p < 0.05) in both studies. the
intention-to-treat cure rates were 61.8% for  xxxd2444xxx  15mg and 44.2% for placebo in one
study.[91]
5. tolerability profile
5.1  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy

the tolerability profile of  xxxd2444xxx  has been
evaluated in over 30 000 patients with gord, gastric or duodenal ulcers, dyspepsia, barrett’s oesophagus or zollinger-ellison syndrome in the
us,[93] the uk[94] and the netherlands.[95] the results of these studies are generally consistent with
the tolerability data from the clinical trials discussed in section 4. tolerability was evaluated for
 xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 and 60 mg/day,[93,95] with the
majority of patients receiving 30 mg/day (dosage
was not reported in one reference).[94] follow-up
ranged from 2[93] or 6 months[94] up to approximately 4 years.[93-95]
in a us review of placebo-controlled 4- to 12week trials in 924 patients with gord or gastric
or duodenal ulcer, the most commonly reported adverse events with  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 and 60 mg/

day were diarrhoea, nausea, headache and abdominal pain (fig. 3).[93] these data are in general
agreement with the incidence of adverse events
seen after 6-month treatment with  xxxd2444xxx 
based on postmarketing surveillance data from a
1994 uk cohort.[94]
a dose-response analysis of placebo-controlled
trials indicated that the incidence of diarrhoea in
 xxxd2444xxx  recipients was dose-dependent;[93] respective incidences were 1.4% for  xxxd2444xxx  15
mg/day, 4.2% for 30 mg/day and 7.4% for 60 mg/
day compared with 2.9% for placebo (60 mg/day
was significantly higher than placebo, although the
p-value was not reported).
in short-term, 4- to 12-week, placebo-controlled us studies there were no significant differences between  xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 or 60 mg/day
and omeprazole 20 mg/day with respect to headache, diarrhoea and nausea; these adverse events
occurred with a frequency of ≤5% (fig. 3).[93] data
from a large uk study which evaluated 3 temporally distinct cohorts within the first 6 months of
drug exposure highlighted a significantly higher
incidence of myalgia, malaise, nausea/vomiting,
depression, diarrhoea and headache for  xxxd2444xxx  compared with omeprazole.[94] the overall incidence of adverse events was generally
<3.5% for both agents. however, these results
must be interpreted with caution given that data on
omeprazole were collected between 1989 to 1990
and  xxxd2444xxx  data relate to 1994.
in 8-week trials in patients with gord[65,67] or
nsaid-related gastric ulcers,[81]  xxxd2444xxx  15
or 30 mg/day was generally associated with a similar incidence of adverse events to ranitidine 300
or 600 mg/day. in 133 patients with gord, adverse events commonly reported with  xxxd2444xxx 
30 mg/day and ranitidine were nausea/vomiting
(9% for both agents), diarrhoea (10 vs 6%, respectively), abdominal pain (7 vs 8%) and headache (12
vs 6%).[65] diarrhoea was the most frequently reported treatment-related event in 353 patients with
nsaid-induced ulcers and occurred in ≤5% of patients in both treatment groups.[81] of note, the incidence of diarrhoea in a risk reduction study comdrugs 2001; 61 (12)

four-year postmarketing surveillance of 10 008
 xxxd2444xxx  15, 30 or 60 mg/day recipients (89%
received 30 mg/day) in the netherlands reported
a similar incidence of adverse events compared
with clinical trial data.[95] the incidences of diarrhoea, headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness and
abdominal pain per 1000 patient-months of use
were 10.7, 7.2, 6.8, 5.3 and 5%, respectively, according to postmarketing surveillance data. comparative clinical trial data show incidences of 9.9,
4.6, 5.9, 2.6 and 5.7%, respectively. flatulence/gas
pain/belching, skin disorders, constipation and
malaise were reported with an incidence of
≤2%.[95] a similar incidence (≤10%) of adverse
events was reported in a 1-year trial in 371 patients
with duodenal ulcer who were given  xxxd2444xxx 
15 or 30 mg/day or ranitidine 150 mg/day.[97] commonly reported adverse events were diarrhoea (9,
5, 3%, respectively), abdominal pain (7, 3, 7%),
headache (7, 2, 3%) and vomiting (2, 3, 7%).
5.2 triple therapy regimens

paring the use of  xxxd2444xxx  and misoprostol in
the prevention of nsaid-related gastric ulcers was
5% with  xxxd2444xxx , 22% for misoprostol and 3%
for placebo (significance not reported).[96]
in trials of 1 month’s duration in patients with
acid-related dyspepsia  xxxd2444xxx  had a similar
tolerability profile to omeprazole and ranitidine.[89,90]
the majority of adverse events were minor and
were gastrointestinal or related to the nervous or
respiratory systems;[89,90] in one study a number of
gastrointestinal symptoms were considered to be
secondary symptoms of dyspepsia.[90]

in combination with various antimicrobial agents
 xxxd2444xxx  30mg twice daily was generally well
tolerated in 1- to 2-week trials.[40-42,45,98] when
given in combination with amoxicillin 1.5 or 2 g/
day, clarithromycin 400mg, 500mg or 1 g/day or
metronidazole 800 mg/day the most commonly reported adverse events were diarrhoea, headache
and taste disturbance. the incidences of adverse
events for triple therapy with  xxxd2444xxx -based
regimens versus an omeprazole-based regimen are
shown in figure 4.[42]
of note,  xxxd2444xxx  30mg/amoxicillin 1g/
clarithromycin 250mg, administered twice daily,
was associated with the highest incidence of diarrhoea (18%) while combined  xxxd2444xxx  30mg/
clarithromycin 250mg/metronidazole 400mg, given
twice daily, was associated with the lowest (4%).
skin rash and pharyngeal oedema were also reported, although the individual frequencies of each

as a triple therapy regimen in combination with
amoxicillin 2 g/day[56,99] or 100 mg/kg/day[55] and
either  xxxd1713xxx /day[56,99] or metronidazole 30 mg/kg/day[55] in children receiving treatment for the eradication of h. pylori infection adverse effects were mild.[55,56,99] dry mouth,[55]
nausea and abdominal pain occurred with a frequency of 14[55] and 25%, respectively.[56] vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness (3% for each) and taste
disturbance (6%) were also reported in a small
number of children.[56]

dosage recommendations for  xxxd2444xxx  differ from country to country; recommendations for
the us and the uk and are outlined according to
indication in table vii.
 xxxd2444xxx  should be taken before meals to
avoid a reduction in the rate and extent of absorption. although  xxxd2444xxx  is usually administered once daily, it may be administered in 2 divided doses in the morning and evening in patients
receiving ≥120mg daily for pathological hypersecretory conditions.[29]
dosage adjustment of  xxxd2444xxx  is not necessary in elderly patients[29] or patients with mild
renal or hepatic impairment.[101] however, in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction a dosage reduction should be considered.
 xxxd2444xxx  is contraindicated in patients with
a known hypersensitivity to any component of the
formulation.[29] caution should be used when
 xxxd2444xxx  is administered to pregnant women
and nursing mothers.[29]
there are currently no recommendations available from the manufacturer concerning the use of
 xxxd2444xxx  in paediatric patients.[29]
7. place of  xxxd2444xxx  in the
management of acid-related disorders

effective suppression of gastric acid secretion
is a key factor in the management of patients with
acid-related disorders.[104,105] a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of acid-related disease has led to the development of more potent
antisecretory agents such as the  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors ( xxxd2444xxx , omeprazole, pantoprazole,
 xxxd3070xxx  and esomeprazole).[43]

it is also recognised that h. pylori infection
plays a major role in ulcer development and therefore agents which possess antibacterial activity are
likely to have a crucial impact on the management
of this disease.[43,103,106,107] unlike histamine h2receptor antagonists such as ranitidine, proton
pump inhibitors exhibit weak anti-h. pylori activity in vitro (section 2.2); on the basis of in vitro
studies  xxxd2444xxx  appears to have more potent
bactericidal activity than either omeprazole or
pantoprazole (table i). although the clinical significance of this is unknown.
these factors give  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors the
overall advantage of greater and longer lasting acid
suppression, which is associated with more rapid
symptom relief, accelerated ulcer healing and bet© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ter disease management than h2-antagonists.[104] it
is not surprising therefore that  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors are the agents of choice in the management of
patients with peptic ulcer disease, gord, gastric
ulcer and nsaid-related ulcers.[105,108]
7.1 peptic ulcer disease

h. pylori is the primary cause of peptic ulcer
disease which is not associated with the use of
nsaids.[40,41] the exact mechanisms by which
h. pylori causes ulceration are not known;[43,107]
however, h. pylori can be isolated from the gastric
mucosa of approximately 90% of patients with duodenal ulcers and 70% of those with gastric ulceration.[107]
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

 xxxd2444xxx : an update

over the past decade the emerging role of h.
pylori infection in the development of peptic ulcers
has redefined the management of this disease. triple therapy with a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor and two
antimicrobial agents has become the ‘gold standard’ for the treatment of h. pylori infection, although to date there is no optimal regimen.[109]
dual therapy regimens including a  xxxg215xxx 
inhibitor and an antimicrobial agent have low overall cure rates in the order of 60 to 70%.[109,110] quadruple therapy regimens combining a  xxxg215xxx 
inhibitor and three antimicrobials are effective yet
relatively complex to administer which may decrease compliance.[108] american college of gastroenterology guidelines recommend that treatment is
initiated with a triple therapy regimen that has
shown an eradication rate of ≥80% in clinical trials.[103] dual therapy regimens are no longer recommended because they have been superseded by
more effective triple therapy regimens. because a
number of effective triple therapy regimens are
available, current research has concentrated on
identifying the most cost-effective regimen and the
regimen with the most effective treatment outcome
in various populations.[110] however, the choice of
treatment regimen may also depend on factors such
as compliance and tolerability.[103]
since the previous review in drugs,[3] a number
of studies have confirmed the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx -based triple therapy in the eradication of
h. pylori infection (section 4.1). in randomised,
controlled clinical trials including ≥300 patients, a
twice daily regimen of  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30mg
administered in combination with amoxicillin or
clarithromycin was as effective in curing h. pylori
infection as regimens comprising omeprazole
20mg or  xxxd3070xxx  10 and 20mg and these antimicrobials. eradication rates with  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg twice daily were generally higher (≥83%)
than with  xxxd2444xxx  15mg, although this was
not statistically significant. both  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg and omeprazole 20mg twice daily were similarly effective when combined with clarithromycin and metronidazole.

recommended treatment durations vary between the us and the uk: 1-week triple therapy
regimens are commonly used in europe whereas
lower eradication rates with this regimen in the us
have prompted the use of 2-week eradication regimens.[108-110] the us food and drug administration (fda) has recently approved the use of 10day therapy with either  xxxd2444xxx  30mg or
omeprazole 20mg plus amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg all administered twice daily.[110]
while there are few direct comparisons between
the 1- and 2-week treatment durations, available
data suggest that higher eradication rates are seen
after 2 weeks of eradication therapy but this is not
significantly different from rates seen after 1
week’s therapy (section 4.1).
with the focus on eradication therapy few studies measure ulcer healing rates; available data show
that 4 to 6 weeks after treatment, ulcer healing was
achieved in ≥80% of patients with lansoprazolebased triple therapy which is similar to ulcer healing seen with an omeprazole-based triple therapy
regimen (section 4.1.2).
despite epidemiological and clinical evidence
suggesting a high prevalence of h. pylori infection
in the elderly population there are very few data
evaluating the efficacy of an eradication regimen
in this patient group.[51] available data suggest that
triple therapy regimens combining  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg with either amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin
250mg (all given twice daily) or metronidazole
250mg (4 times daily) are equally effective with
eradication rates in the order of 80% (section 4.1.1)
and symptom resolution occurring in 76% of patients. similar eradication rates were also seen in a
comparative trial of  xxxd2444xxx  30mg, omeprazole 20mg or pantoprazole 40mg administered
twice daily for 7 days in combination with amoxicillin 1g twice daily and metronidazole 250mg 4
times daily; eradication rates for all three regimens
ranged from 78 to 81%.[52] further investigation of
the optimal treatment regimen for h. pylori eradication in elderly patients is needed before the place
of  xxxd2444xxx -based triple therapy in this patient
group can be fully determined.

as in adults, most children with h. pylori infection are asymptomatic and have no sequelae. however, h. pylori is one cause of peptic ulcer disease
in children, primarily duodenal ulcers.[111] because
of concerns that diagnostic tests and treatments for
h. pylori infection were being used in excess of
their established benefit in children, consensus
guidelines were established by three multidisciplinary groups.[112] all guidelines advise against a
test-and-treat strategy in children, but eradication
therapy is indicated in children with an endoscopically confirmed peptic ulcer and h. pylori determined by histopathology.[112]
on the basis of efficacious regimens used in
adults all three guidelines recommend a triple therapy regimen administered twice daily for up to 2
weeks.[112,113] in particular, a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor in combination with two of either amoxicillin,
clarithromycin or metronidazole is recommended.
however, well designed, comparative clinical trials are necessary before the optimal treatment regimen for the eradication of h. pylori in children is
determined (section 4.1.3).
the discovery that ulcer recurrence is associated
with reinfection by h. pylori suggests that eradication therapy should obviate the need for maintenance therapy in the majority of patients.[114] indeed, ulcer recurrence rates after successful
eradication therapy have been reported to be as low
as approximately 10% over a 6- to 12-month period.[115] by comparison 1-year recurrence rates
with conventional therapy may be as high as 85% if
no maintenance therapy is given.[114-116]
at present h. pylori infection is effectively
cured via antisecretory and antimicrobial-based
therapy; however, antibiotic resistance to currently
used agents, such as clarithromycin and metronidazole, is becoming more prevalent.[109,110] estimates of antimicrobial resistance vary but in the
us the frequency of primary metronidazole resistance is approximately 37% and primary clarithromycin resistance is 6%.[109] the prevalence of
secondary resistance (resistance developed after
attempted eradication of h. pylori) is also increasing in the us.[110] to combat this growing problem,

current efforts are focusing on the development of
a vaccine to prevent h. pylori infection.[106,109]
7.2 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease

gord is a chronic relapsing disease with varied symptomology which, although responsive to
short-term therapy, often requires long-term maintenance treatment.[117-119] symptoms primarily include heartburn and/or regurgitation which often
occur after meals and may be accompanied by mucosal damage in some patients.[119] problematic
gord with erosive oesophagitis may be associated with persistent symptoms that may be refractory to therapy or may recur rapidly after treatment
is discontinued.[118] furthermore, the risk of developing oesophageal carcinoma appears to increase
in relation to the increasing frequency, severity and
duration of gord symptoms suggesting aggressive early treatment of this disease may be particularly important.[120]
treatment guidelines outlined by the american
college of gastroenterology recommend lifestyle
modifications such as smoking cessation, dietary
modification, reducing alcohol intake, elevation of
the head while in bed and avoidance of reclining or
lying positions for 3 hours after eating may be effective and should be continued for the course of
therapy.[119] antacids and antireflux agents may be
effective in the short-term treatment of mild
gord. however, if symptoms persist proton
pump inhibitors are recommended for the initial
treatment of gord. histamine h2-receptor antagonists (such as ranitidine) may also be effective in
some patients with less severe gord.[119]
according to the american college of gastroenterology, maintenance therapy with a proton
pump inhibitor is recommended in patients whose
symptoms are not controlled by lifestyle modifications and antacids.[119] while histamine h2-receptor antagonists are effective in the management of
gord, particularly in patients with mild symptoms, multiple doses need to be given and often
higher dosages may be required in addition, drug
tolerance may develop in the long term.[117]
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

 xxxd2444xxx : an update

of note, the uk product licence for the prokinetic drug  xxxd1708xxx  has been suspended, marketing of this agent has also ceased in canada and
germany, after 386 reports of serious ventricular
arrhythmias (including 125 fatalities) worldwide.[121] this has also prompted removal of
 xxxd1708xxx  from the us market where it has carried
an fda ‘black box’ warning since 1988.[122,123]
in well designed clinical trials  xxxd2444xxx  15
and 30mg once daily was significantly more effective in promoting endoscopically confirmed healing and symptom relief than either ranitidine
300mg once daily or  xxxd1708xxx  10 and 20mg twice
daily in the short-term treatment of over 800 patients with erosive reflux oesophagitis (section
4.2.1).  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day was generally as
effective as omeprazole 20 mg/day and pantoprazole 40 mg/day in the short-term management
of gord. although in a multicentre us trial in
>3500 patients  xxxd2444xxx  significantly reduced
the proportion of days with heartburn compared
with omeprazole.[62]
on the basis of several dose comparison studies
it is unclear whether  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day
is more effective in the maintenance treatment of
patients with gord (section 4.2.2). however, the
lower dose is at least as effective as the 30mg dose
in clinical trials and has recently been approved by
the fda for the treatment of symptomatic gord
(section 6).[59]
comparative results for  xxxd2444xxx  and omeprazole administered as maintenance therapy for
gord are somewhat equivocal. relapse rates
were similar in approximately 250 patients in a
well designed multicentre clinical trial comparing
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day and omeprazole 20 mg/
day (section 4.2.2). however, in another trial in
approximately 400 patients, which used lower
doses of both agents, 12-month relapse rates were
markedly higher although significantly fewer
 xxxd2444xxx  15 mg/day recipients relapsed. further clinical trials comparing  xxxd2444xxx  15 and
30 mg/day with omeprazole 20 mg/day and other
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitors are necessary to better determine the most effective maintenance regimen.

in children over approximately 10 to 12 years
of age, gord presents in much the same way as
in adults. in children under 2 to 3 years of age, the
most common presentation is with recurrent vomiting, irritability with feeding, cough, signs of dysphagia, and failure to thrive. more rarely, apnoea
or neurobehavioural symptoms may occur.[124]
lifestyle modification has a minimal role in the
management of gord in children, and then usually only as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy.[112]
treatment of children with gord has generally
included prokinetic agents such as  xxxd1708xxx , and
histamine h2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine.[112,125] however, in adults  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors have been shown to be more effective in the
treatment of gord (section 4.2.1). there are limited data on the use of  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors in
children, although dosage regimens and the efficacy and tolerability of omeprazole have been established.[126-128] in addition, omeprazole is the
only  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor for which there is longterm efficacy and tolerabilty data in children.[128]
to date there are few available data on the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  in the treatment of children
with gord. preliminary data in 164 children with
erosive and nonerosive gord, 35 of whom were
refractory to ranitidine, showed that  xxxd2444xxx 
15 and 30 mg/day administered from 5 days up to
12 weeks effectively healed and provided symptom relief (section 4.2.3). overall symptom relief
was observed in >70% of children; healing rates
varied between trials, with 100% of children
healed in one trial and 75% of those responding to
the initial dosage (1.3 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) healing in
another. healing rates would be expected to increase with the determination of the optimal dosage regimen. long-term studies determining the
role of  xxxd2444xxx  in the maintenance treatment
of gord in children are awaited with interest.
in adults  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors are largely
equivalent with respect to efficacy. therefore the
choice of treatment may well depend on economic
factors and variables such as tolerability, compliance and the patient group being treated. in the
treatment of gord,  xxxd2444xxx  is clearly more
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

1828

effective than either ranitidine or  xxxd1708xxx  and preliminary data establishing its efficacy in children
are promising.
7.3 nsaid-related gastric ulcers

in the us approximately 20 million patients
take nsaids regularly, resulting in approximately
200 000 to 400 000 hospitalisations for serious
gastrointestinal complications at an average cost of
0.8 to 1.6 billion dollars annually.[129]
nsaid-related gastrointestinal injury may occur either as a result of direct injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa or systemic damage sustained
via decreased prostaglandin production.[130] decreased prostaglandin production is thought to be
the primary cause of important gastrointestinal injury and complications.[107,130] treatment guidelines of the american college of gastroenterology
state that it is preferable to discontinue nsaid use
when ulceration occurs. however, many patients
have chronic conditions which require continuous
nsaid therapy: in these patients a  xxxg215xxx 
inhibitor is the agent of choice.[129] treatment for
h. pylori is recommended in patients infected with
this organism.
in randomised, double-blind multicentre trials
 xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30 mg/day were significantly
more effective in achieving ulcer healing than
ranitidine 150mg twice daily irrespective of h. pylori status (section 4.3.1). total ulcer healing rates
were markedly higher with  xxxd2444xxx . additionally,  xxxd2444xxx  maintenance therapy prevented
ulcer relapse in patients who continued nsaid
therapy and may be a valuable treatment option in
the management of patients with chronic conditions plus gord. clinical trials comparing  xxxd2444xxx  with other  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors would
be of value.
 xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30 mg/day is also indicated
in the prevention of nsaid-related gastric ulcers
(section 6). american college of gastroenterology
guidelines recommend that patients at risk of aspirin- and other nsaid-related ulcers should be considered for prophylactic treatment with misoprostol or a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor.[129] several

matheson & jarvis

factors that have been linked with an increased risk
of nsaid-related gastrointestinal complications
include:
• prior history of a gastrointestinal event
• age >60 years
• high dose treatment
• concurrent use of corticosteroids
• concurrent use of anticoagulants.[129]
in a well designed clinical trial  xxxd2444xxx  15
and 30 mg/day was equally as effective as misoprostol 200mug 4 times daily in the prevention of
nsaid-related ulcers (section 4.3.3). patient compliance may well be enhanced by the once a day
administration regimen and markedly lower incidence of diarrhoea associated with  xxxd2444xxx 
treatment (section 5.1).
7.4 acid-related dyspepsia

the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  has been evaluated
in a small number of studies in patients with acidrelated dyspepsia.
acid-related dyspepsia defines patients with
dyspeptic symptoms which respond to acid suppression therapy but for which no organic cause
can be found.[89] patients with dyspepsia, defined
as pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, present predominantly with symptoms of discomfort,
fullness, bloating, early satiety and nausea or ulcerlike with epigastric pain.[131] long-term intermittent treatment is indicated for patients with this
disease. data from clinical trials suggest that  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day provides fast and effective symptom relief in these patients and is superior
in efficacy to ranitidine 150mg twice daily and
similar to omeprazole 10mg once daily (section
4.4.1). furthermore, its once daily administration
regimen, the lower consumption of antacids and
comparable tolerability profile (section 5.1) make
 xxxd2444xxx  a useful alternative to ranitidine.
of particular interest is the finding that  xxxd2444xxx  15mg may provide better symptom relief
than omeprazole in patients with ulcer-like dyspepsia, whereas the latter may be most effective in patients with reflux-like dyspepsia; further study is
necessary to confirm these preliminary findings.
drugs 2001; 61 (12)

 xxxd2444xxx : an update

7.5 tolerability

the tolerability profile of  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy has been extensively evaluated in over 30 000
patients with peptic ulcer disease, gord, dyspepsia, barrett’s oesophagus and zollinger-ellison
syndrome in a review of us clinical trials and via
postmarketing surveillance in the netherlands and
in three temporally distinct cohorts in the uk.
the most commonly reported adverse events after short-term administration of  xxxd2444xxx  15,
30 or 60 mg/day were diarrhoea, which appears to
be dose-dependent, nausea, headache and abdominal pain which occurred with an incidence of ≤5%.
the tolerability profiles of  xxxd2444xxx  and omeprazole appear to be relatively similar with adverse events occurring in fewer than ≤5% of recipients in short-term placebo-controlled us studies.
while data in uk cohort of 45 075 patients highlight a significantly higher incidence of adverse
events with  xxxd2444xxx  versus omeprazole these
results must be interpreted with caution since they
relate to three temporally distinct cohorts and are
not direct comparisons.
 xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30 mg/day and ranitidine
300 and 600 mg/day had similar adverse event profiles in patients with gord, nsaid-related ulcers
and acid-related dyspepsia. however, the incidence of headache in  xxxd2444xxx  30mg recipients
was double that of ranitidine in patients with
gord, although this difference was not significant.
adverse events associated with the long-term
administration of  xxxd2444xxx  were generally similar to those observed with short-term therapy.
based on available data  xxxd2444xxx -based triple
therapy regimens (combined with either amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole) appear to
be well tolerated in both adults and children (sections 5.2 and 5.3). diarrhoea, headache and taste
disturbance were most frequently reported in
adults regardless of regimen; in children dry
mouth, nausea and abdominal pain were more
common.

7.6 conclusions

the place of  xxxd2444xxx  in the management of
acid-related disorders is well defined. lansoprazolebased triple therapy is an effective treatment option
for the eradication of h. pylori infection in patients
with peptic ulcer disease. preliminary data suggest it
may have an important role in the management of this
infection in children and the elderly. in the short-term
management of gord,  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy
offers an effective alternative to histamine h2-receptor
antagonists and initial data suggest that it may also
be an effective treatment option in children and
adolescents.  xxxd2444xxx  maintenance therapy is
also an established treatment option for the longterm management of this chronic disease.  xxxd2444xxx  has a role in the treatment and prevention of
nsaid-related ulcers and the treatment of patients
with acid-related dyspepsia; however, further studies are needed to confirm its place in these indications.  xxxd2444xxx  has emerged as a useful and
well tolerated treatment option in the management
of acid-related disorders.
