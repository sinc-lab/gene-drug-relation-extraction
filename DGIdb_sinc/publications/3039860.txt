determine
the glomerular

studied the effect of dopaminergic

adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic

(camp) accumulation
in rat glomerular
mesangial and epithelial
cells in culture. da
caused a marked dose- and time-dependent
increase in camp

in mesangial but not epithelial
cells. the stimulatory effect of da was abolished by the da antagonists

and cis- xxxd3359xxx 
but not by p- or cyadrenergic or histamine
antagonists.
similar to the effects of
da, two dopamine type i receptor agonists,  xxxd2097xxx 
and
skf 38393, markedly stimulated
camp accumulation
in the
mesangial cells. moreover, the effects of da were blocked by
sch 23390, a specific da, receptor antagonist, but not  xxxd1927xxx , a specific da, antagonist.
these results show that da
regulates camp accumulation
in mesangial cells via da,-type
receptors.
catecholamines;

glomerulus;

receptors

dopamine (da) is a catecholamine that exerts profound
effects on renal hemodynamics
(9, 14, 25, 34). the actions of da in general are mediated through interaction
with specific da receptors as well as cy-and p-adrenergic
receptors (14, 34). there is good evidence that most of
the hemodynamic effects of da in the kidney are mediated via specific receptors distinct from the cy- and padrenergic receptors (11, 13-15).
there are two main
subclasses of da receptors, designated da, and  xxxd1379xxx 
(34). the da, receptor is postsynaptic, linked to adenylate cyclase, and mediates vasodilation in the renal artery
(14, 15). the  xxxd1379xxx  receptor is presynaptic and inhibits
norepinephrine
release (34). recent in vivo and in vitro
studies suggest that the increase in renal blood flow and
natriuresis that follows da infusion results from activation of the da, receptor subtype (10, 11,13). moreover,
da has been shown to increase adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic
monophosphate
(camp) levels in the perfusate of rat
kidney (30), and da sensitive adenylate cyclase is present in the renal artery of the canine kidney (28) and
human renal tissue (29, 36).
several recent in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that
glomeruli and specifically glomerular mesangial cells regulate glomerular hemodynamics (8, 32). vasoactive horh358

mones that influence the glomerular microcirculation,
including histamine, norepinephrine,
epinephrine, and
 xxxd2401xxx  have been shown to increase camp levels
in glomeruli or glomerular mesangial cells in culture (16,
23, 24, 32, 33). glomerular cells may be a target for the
actions of da. da-containing
neuronal elements have
been demonstrated by histofluorescence at the vascular
pole of the glomerulus (5). rat renal cortex and isolated
glomeruli synthesize da in vitro from extracellular ldopa (levodopa; 37). incubation of isolated rat glomeruli
with da results in either no change (6) or a small
increase in camp accumulation (22), suggesting that da
receptors linked to adenylate cyclase may be present.
wargo et al. (38) found a small increase (41%) in camp
levels in isolated glomeruli from the outer but not inner
cortex of the dog kidney after incubation with 10v4 m
da (35). kotake et al. (22) found a dose-related stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity as well as enhanced
camp accumulation in isolated rat glomeruli in response
to da. by the utilization of dopaminergic and ,&adrenergic agonists and antagonists, the authors (22) suggested that da is a mixed agonist in rat glomeruli acting
via both dopaminergic and ,@-adrenergic receptors. with
the use of radioligand-binding
assays as well as adenylate
cyclase determination,
felder et al. (11) suggested that
da receptors of the  xxxd1379xxx  but not the da1 subclass are
present in isolated rat glomeruli.
the interpretation
of studies in isolated glomeruli may
be difficult due to cell injury during isolation, contamination by tubules, vessels, or more importantly
due to
the presence of heterogeneous cell populations. by growing glomerular cells in culture, cultivation of homogenous
populations of single cell types is possible, thus eliminating many of these problems. in the present studies,
epithelial and mesangial cells from rat glomeruli were
grown in culture. we studied the effects of da, as well
as its specific agonists and antagonists, on camp accumulation in these cells to determine the cell types affected by da.

not soluble in water, such as skf 82526 j, skf 38393,

of

cell culture. epithelial and mesangial cells from rat
glomeruli were cultured and characterized as previously
described (12, 33). male sprague-dawley rats, weighing
100-200 g were anesthesized with ether and killed by
exsanguination. the kidneys were immediately removed
and placed in sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs)
with penicillin, streptomycin,
and  xxxd164xxx . under a
laminar flow hood, the renal capsule was removed and
the cortex separated from the medulla and minced. renal
cortical tissue from three to four rats was pooled for each
culture. the cortical tissue was pushed through a 212pm stainless steel sieve and then progressively passed
through nitex nylon sieves of 315, 250-, 180-, and 150pm pore size. the glomeruli were collected on top of a
75-pm sieve, passed once more over a 15o-pm sieve, and
then centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. glomeruli were
resuspended in culture media and plated in costar 35mm multiwell dishes. the culture media used was rpm1
1640, buffered with 15 mm n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine2v’-2-ethanesulfonic
acid (hepes), ph 7.4, supplemented with 17% inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.6 u/ml
insulin, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 pg/ml streptomycin,
and 0.25 pg/ml  xxxd164xxx . glomeruli attach to the culture dish and epithelial cells start to spread within 48 h,
reaching maximal growth at 6-9 days. experiments on
epithelial cells were performed at this time. mesangial
cells were obtained from primary cultures left to grow
for 3-4 wk, at which time only confluent mesangial cells
remain. mesangial cells were subcultured in 0.05% trypsin-o.6 mm edta and plated onto 35-mm diameter sixwell dishes at a density of lo5 cells/well. the cells were
confluent by lo-14 days, at which time the experiments
on mesangial cell were performed.
identification
of cells. six to seven days after glomerular plating, phase-contrast
microscopy showed that the
majority of cells in the culture were small, polyhedral,
and had a cobblestone appearance. on electron microscopy, these cells had large, rounded nuclei, prominent
nucleoli, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and
many free polysomes. intercellular junctions and microvilli on the surface of the cells were also seen. these
findings are typical of glomerular epithelial cells as described in situ as well as in cloned epithelial cell cultures

(23). after 7-8 days, a second cell type, which was stellate
or fusiform in shape by phase-contrast microscopy, began
to grow from the glomeruli. these cells became predominant in the primary culture by 2-3 wk, whereas the
epithelial cells senesced and detached from the culture
dish. at this time, the cells were subcultured, and only
the stellate mesangial cells survived this passage. this
differential
growth pattern of epithelial and mesangial
cells from explanted glomeruli has been well described
by foidart et al. (12). with the use of electron microscopy, numerous bundles of myofilaments, dense patches,
and elongated, irregular nuclei were seen in these cells.
electron microscopy studies were performed on subcultures from several cell cultures, and at least 20 cells were
examined in each study. all the cells showed these characteristic features of mesangial cells including myofilaments parallel to the plasma membrane and dense
patches as described in situ and in cloned mesangial cells
by other investigators (23). immunoperoxidase
staining
of mesangial cell subcultures showed the presence of
fibronectin within all the cells as well as the extracellular
matrix. endothelial cell contamination
was excluded by
negative immunoperoxidase
staining for factor viii antigen. human umbilical vein endothelial cells and rat
renal cortical blood vessels were used as positive controls
for the factor viii antigen. angiotensin-converting
enzyme activity was not detected in the mesangial cell
cultures.
aminonucleoside
of  xxxd3041xxx  (pan), an epithelial
cell cytotoxin, caused detachment of >90% of the cells
in the early primary cultures (epithelial) but caused no
detatchment or morphological change in the subcultures
(mesangial). in contrast,  xxxd2655xxx  c, a known mesangial cell toxin, had no effect on the primary cultures, but
caused flattening and detachment of the majority of the
mesangial cells in the subcultures. also, in previous
studies (33) the mesangial cell subcultures were found to
grow and reach confluence in media in which d-valine
had been substituted for  xxxd3483xxx , suggesting that there
was no significant contamination
by fibroblasts. in addition, mesangial cells contract in response to  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii) and histamine.
incubation conditions. da and its agonists and antagonists were tested for their effects on camp accumulation in epithelial and mesangial cells. the cells were
incubated with the various drugs in the 35-mm wells
(33). at the time of the experi .ment, the cells were washed
twice with kreb’s buffer, ph 7.4, at 37oc. the incubation
medium (kreb’s buffer with 2.0 mm ca2+ and 1.2 mm
mg+) containing da or agonist is then added to the cells
which are incubated in 1 ml volume at 37°c for 5 min
unless otherwise stated. control incubations were included in each experiment and consisted of wells incubated with kreb’s buffer alone. all incubations were
performed in the presence of 0.5 mm mix, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. in the experiments using antagonists, the cells were prei ncubated with medium alone or
medium containing the antagonist for 10 min. this medium was then removed and fresh medium alone, or
medium containing da with or without the antagonist,
was then added for 5 min. the incubation was terminated

by adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 15% trichloroacetic
acid
(tca) at 4°c the media was removed, and the cells were
washed with an additional 0.5 ml of 5% tca for 30 min.
the two tca samples were pooled, and the tca was
extracted from the samples with water-saturated
ether
(3-4 extractions) until the ph of the sample was >5. the
remaining ether was removed by heating. aliquots of the
samples were diluted, and total camp was determined
by radioimmunoassay
after acetylation to increase the
sensitivity of the assay (33). in some experiments, at the
end of the incubation, the medium was rapidly separated
from the cells and frozen; 5% tca was immediately
added to the cells to end the reaction. camp was determined on aliquots from the medium and cells separately.
in preliminary experiments, we found that this method
extracts >95% of intracellular camp without the need
to scrape, sonicate, or homogenize the cells. after the
tca wash was removed, 1 ml of 1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (sds) was added to the dishes and they were
tightly sealed and allowed to remain at room temperature
for 24 h. an aliquot was then taken for protein determination by the lowry method. all the drugs used in this
study were tested for possible interference with the
camp radioimmunoassay.
at the highest concentration
used, none of the drugs interfered with the radioimmunoassay for camp.
the data are expressed as picomoles camp per milligram cell protein. means t se were determined for each
specific incubation condition by combining the results
from duplicate or triplicate wells from all experiments.
the number of experiments performed for each condition
is noted in the figure legends. paired and unpaired t tests
and analysis of variance were used to determine significance as appropriate. p values < 0.05 were considered
significant.

effect of antagonists. in some tissues, including isolated

(22). furthermore,  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, and norepinephrine have been shown to stimulate camp accumulation in cultured mesangial cells via a ,&adrenergic
receptor (24). to determine whether the effect of da on
camp accumulation was mediated at least in part via padrenergic receptors, we tested the effect of the da
receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and the p-adrenergic
antagonist, propranolol, on da- and  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated camp accumulation in mesangial cells (fig. 3).

inhibited by several da antagonists, but not by ar- or ,8adrenergic antagonists, nor histamine hz receptor antagonists. the demonstration
that da can influence the
“second messenger” camp, and that this effect is inhibited by known da receptor antagonists provides good
evidence that there are specific receptors for da present
on mesangial cells. there was no detectable increase in
camp when da was added to the primary cultures, 6-9
days after the glomeruli were plated. mesangial cells
constitute only a small percentage of the total cell population in these early primary cultures, whereas the vast
majority of the cells are epithelial. since there is no
stimulation of camp in response to da in these cultures,
we conclude that the epithelial cells do not have da
receptors linked to camp. there are probably too few
mesangial cells in the primary cultures to detect a significant response. although our studies do not exclude
the possibility that mesangial cells only express da
receptors after subculturing, this seems unlikely since
the most common phenotypical change of cultured cells
is loss of receptors rather than acquisition of de novo
receptors.

other hormones that affect renal hemodynamics, including the catecholamines  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine,
and norepinephrine, as well as histamine, adenosine, and
 xxxd1903xxx  have previously been shown to stimulate camp accumulation in mesangial cells. the stimulation of camp by da or ,&adrenergic agonists is unequivocally mediated via different  xxxg92xxx  types. da-stimulated
camp accumulation was abolished by the dopaminergic antagonists, haloperidol, but
not by the ,&adrenergic blocker, propranolol. moreover,
propranolol completely inhibited camp accumulation
due to the ,&adrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx , whereas
haloperidol
had no effect on  xxxd2401xxx -induced
camp accumulation.
our results, using mesangial cells in culture, demonstrate a marked stimulatory
effect of da on camp
accumulation, whereas incubation of da with isolated
glomeruli by us and others (6, 22, 38) have shown little
or no change in camp levels. it is possible that da
receptors on mesangial cells may not be readily accessible
to exogenous da in studies using whole glomeruli, especially if substantial amounts of da are metabolized by
other glomerular cell types. additionally,
da may have
inhibitory
effects on camp in other cells present in
glomeruli resulting in little or no change in total camp
levels. as reported by felder et al. (11), binding studies
have failed to demonstrate da1 receptors on isolated
whole glomeruli. there are several possibilities for this
finding. as explained earlier, the da receptors on mesangial cells may not be available for binding when whole
glomeruli are used due to their physical location within
the glomerulus. it is also possible that da receptors on
mesangial cells are injured during the process of glomerular isolation and require time in a healthy nutrient
medium to recover. since our studies were performed on
monolayers of mesangial cells, the potential problems of
accessibility to cell surface receptors, modulation of ef-

fects by other cell types, or damage to the receptor from
the isolation procedure are eliminated.
the effect of da on camp accumulation in mesangial
cells is most likely mediated by stimulation of adenylate
cyclase, since our studies were conducted in the presence
of relatively high concentrations of a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor. moreover da has been shown to stimulate
adenylate cyclase in several tissues including the kidney
(18, 22, 28). the mechanism by which da stimulates
this enzyme remains to be determined. a recent report
(31) shows that da results in a marked increase in
guanosine 5’-triphosphate
levels in retinal tissue suggesting that this guanine nucleotide may serve to facilitate da stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity.
the availability of new, highly selective da agonists
and antagonists facilitated the identification
of the da
receptor subclass linked to da-stimulated
camp accumulation in mesangial cells as a da, receptor. da,
receptors have previously been shown to be linked to the
adenylate cyclase system in rat striatal tissue and in the
renal artery where they mediate vasodilation (18,22,28).
the da1 agonist, skf 82526 j had both qualitatively
and quantitatively similar effects to da on camp accumulation in mesangial cells. this benzazepine derivative
of da, which is a potent vasodilator in the canine kidney
and an effective antihypertensive
in humans, has been
shown to be devoid of  xxxd1379xxx , cy-,or p-adrenergic receptor
stimulating activities (3). in addition, the da1 antagonist, sch 23390, completely abolished the stimulation of
camp accumulation, whereas the dab antagonist,  xxxd1927xxx , had no significant effect on da-stimulated
camp accumulation in mesangial cells. it should be
emphasized that the high specificity of these compounds
for the da, and  xxxd1379xxx  receptors, respectively, has recently
been demonstrated in vivo. sch 23390 completely blocks

gic receptors (4,13,17).  xxxd1927xxx , on the other hand,
blocks dan-mediated responses without affecting da1induced vasodilation (13,zo). recent reports suggest the
presence of some interaction between the dopamine and
 xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx . the serotonin antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx ,
has been shown to have a strong affinity for displacing
labeled sch 23390 binding to rat striatum (1). however,
it is highly unlikely that the effect of da on camp
adcumulation in mesangial cells is mediated via serotonergic receptors, since we have recently shown that serotonin does not stimulate camp accumulation in rat
mesangial cells ( 19).
the precise biological effects of da on mesangial cells
are not known. da, receptors present on contractile
mesangial cells may be important
in modulating the
effect of da on the glomerulus itself (2, 35). there is

mesangial

h363

cells

recent in vitro evidence to suggest that da may affect
glomerular hemodynamics. barnett et al. (2) reported
that da, in a concentration that significantly stimulated
camp accumulation by mesangial cells in our studies,
markedly attenuated the contractile effect of ang ii in
isolated rat glomeruli. contractile mesangial cells are
thought to regulate glomerular filtration surface area (7,
32). it is therefore conceivable that da synthesized or
released locally may play an important physiological role
in counteracting the effects of ang ii or other vasoconstrictors on the glomerulus and specifically on mesangial
cells. since in vivo as well as in vitro studies have shown
that da stimulates renin release (26, 27), it is also
possible that activation of the renin-angiotensin
system
may be another mechanism by which da affects glomerular hemodynamics. the failure of infused da as well as
other renal vasodilators to significantly increase glomerular filtration rate in spite of marked increases in renal
blood flow could be due to release of the potent vasoconstrictor, ang ii, with subsequent mesangial cell contraction and reduction in kf (13-e). a clear understanding of the mechanisms whereby da exerts its effects on
glomerular hemodynamics will require further study. of
note is that the concentration of da required to stimulate
camp in mesangial cells is similar to that reported for
da-induced afferent and efferent dilation (8). although
these concentrations far exceed the circulating levels of
free da (21), high concentrations of da may be achieved
through synthesis and/or release of neuronal as well as
nonneuronal da (21), at the vascular pole, and within
the glomerulus itself. it is very likely that the net effect
of da on glomerular hemodynamics is largely dependent
on the manner of availability of da, i.e., local release or
delivery through the systemic circulation.
in conclusion, this is the first demonstration
of the
presence of da receptors on rat glomerular mesangial
cells. these receptors are of the da, subclass and mediate increases in camp accumulation. this finding,
along with an increasing body of evidence, further suggests that da may play a role in the control of glomerular
hemodynamics. abnormalities

the lot al synthesis or degradation of da within the

of the pharmacology of da receptors.
