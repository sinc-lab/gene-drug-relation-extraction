the mechanism of action of the antiepileptic and antinociceptive
drugs of the gabapentinoid family has remained poorly understood. gabapentin (gbp) binds to an exofacial epitope of the ␣2␦-1
and ␣2␦-2 auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, but
acute inhibition of calcium currents by gbp is either very minor or
absent. we formulated the hypothesis that gbp impairs the ability
of ␣2␦ subunits to enhance voltage-gated ca2ⴙchannel plasma
membrane density by means of an effect on trafficking. our results
conclusively demonstrate that gbp inhibits calcium currents, mimicking a lack of ␣2␦ only when applied chronically, but not acutely,
both in heterologous expression systems and in dorsal rootganglion neurons. gbp acts primarily at an intracellular location,
requiring uptake, because the effect of chronically applied gbp is
blocked by an inhibitor of the system-l neutral amino acid transporters and enhanced by coexpression of a transporter. however,
it is mediated by ␣2␦ subunits, being prevented by mutations in
either ␣2␦-1 or ␣2␦-2 that abolish gbp binding, and is not observed
for ␣2␦-3, which does not bind gbp. furthermore, the trafficking of
␣2␦-2 and cav2 channels is disrupted both by gbp and by the
mutation in ␣2␦-2, which prevents gbp binding, and we find that
gbp reduces cell-surface expression of ␣2␦-2 and  xxxg302xxx  subunits.
our evidence indicates that gbp may act chronically by displacing
an endogenous ligand that is normally a positive modulator of ␣2␦
subunit function, thereby impairing the trafficking function of the
␣2␦ subunits to which it binds.

v

oltage-gated ca2⫹channels (vgccs) are heteromeric complexes. the  xxxg346xxx  and cav2 subfamilies are made up of a
pore-forming ␣ 1 subunit, associated with a membraneanchored, predominantly extracellular, ␣2␦ subunit (for review
see ref. 1) and an intracellular ␤ subunit (for review see ref. 2).
mammalian genes encoding four ␣2␦ subunits have been identified (for reviews see refs. 2 and 3). the topology of the ␣2␦
protein was first determined for ␣2␦-1 and is thought to generalize to all ␣2␦ subunits (for reviews see refs. 1 and 4). they are
type i transmembrane proteins, the exofacial ␣2 subunit being
disulfide-bonded to a transmembrane ␦ subunit, formed by
posttranslational cleavage of the ␣2␦ preprotein (5).
the mechanism of action of the antiepileptic and antinociceptive drugs of the gabapentinoid family has remained poorly
understood. gabapentin (gbp) itself was originally developed as
an analog of ␥-amino-butyric acid (gaba), but is now believed
to have no effect on gaba receptors or transporters (for review
see ref. 6). the first key to understanding the mechanism of
action of gbp came from purification of the gbp-binding
protein from porcine brain (7), which was identified as the ␣2␦-1
auxiliary subunit of vgccs. it is now known that gbp binds to
an exofacial epitope present in both the ␣2␦-1 and ␣2␦-2 subunits
(for reviews see refs. 1 and 8). however, although it was
originally reported that gbp application results in acute inhibition of calcium currents (9, 10), in most studies, acute inhibition by gbp is either very minor or absent (for review see ref.
1). furthermore, electrophysiological studies of synaptic transmission are also equivocal, with some studies reporting inhibition by gbp (11), and other studies reporting no inhibition (12).

when neurotransmitter release is measured, there appears to be
little or no effect on depolarization-stimulated release of several
different neurotransmitters, but inhibition of release when this
has been enhanced by specific mediators (13–15). in general,
none of these studies points to the mechanism of action being a
simple inhibition of calcium currents.
we formulated the hypothesis that gbp impairs the ability of
␣2␦ subunits to enhance vgcc plasma membrane density, via
an effect on trafficking. this would be in agreement with the
finding that in vivo responses to gabapentinoid drugs are fairly
slow in onset (16), and gbp does not inhibit acute pain (for
reviews see refs. 6 and 17).

inhibition of  xxxg302xxx  and  xxxg303xxx  currents by chronic, but not acute,
gbp. we first compared the ability of gbp to inhibit calcium

currents, either acutely, or when included for 40 h in the culture
medium after transfection of tsa-201 cells with  xxxg302xxx /␤4 and
␣2␦-2. chronic incubation with gbp (1 mm) reduced currents
formed with the wt ␣2␦-2 by 72.2 ⫾ 4.2% at ⫹15 mv (fig. 1a).
furthermore, whereas the coexpression of ␣2␦ subunits typically
shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation to
more negative potentials (fig. 1b), this was depolarized by 9.3
mv in the continued presence of gbp (fig. 1b). thus, chronic
gbp mimicked a lack of influence of ␣2␦ on the currents. in
confirmation, a similar effect of chronic gbp was observed when
 xxxg302xxx /␤4 was transfected into a cell line stably expressing ␣2␦-2,
where peak currents were 53.4 ⫾ 14.0% smaller when cells were
cultured with 1 mm gbp [supporting information (si) fig. 5a].
furthermore, the steady-state inactivation was again depolarized by 11 mv by gbp (si fig. 5b), and the currents showed
significantly slower inactivation (si fig. 5 c and d). in contrast,
when gbp was applied either acutely for 10 min (fig. 1c), or for
3–6 h before recording (n ⫽ 8, data not shown), it had no effect
on iba in the same system.
a high concentration of gbp was used initially, because our
hypothesis required gbp either to be taken up by system-l
transporters and subsequently to bind intracellular ␣2␦ subunits
and affect forward trafficking or, alternatively, to bind directly
to cell surface ␣2␦ subunits and affect trafficking at the level of
endocytosis or recycling. for both of these sites, it will be

competing with other large neutral amino acids (18, 19), and
both isoleucine and leucine are present at 800 ␮m and valine at
400 ␮m in the culture medium. however, plasma concentrations
of 70–120 ␮m gbp are clinically relevant (20), and chronic
application of 100 ␮m gbp also produced a significant reduction
of iba, by 45.0 ⫾ 9.9% (fig. 1 d and e). it also slowed the
inactivation of the currents, again a hallmark of calcium channel
currents not influenced by ␣2␦ (si fig. 6 a and b). in the
prolonged presence of gbp, the  xxxg302xxx /␤4/␣2␦-2 current density
approached that observed in the absence of ␣2␦ subunits
(fig. 1e).
the effect of chronic gbp was also observed in the presence
of ␣2␦-1, because 1 mm gbp reduced peak  xxxg303xxx /␤1b/␣2␦-1
currents by 70.5 ⫾ 7.3% (fig. 1f), and depolarized the midpoint
for steady-state inactivation from ⫺55.5 ⫾ 3.4 mv to ⫺39.7 ⫾

evidence for an intracellular site of action of gbp. the in vivo
potency of gbp has been shown to depend both on binding to
␣2␦ subunits and on substrate activity for system-l amino acid
transporters (24, 25), attributed to the requirement for the
zwitterionic drug to pass the blood–brain barrier (18). to
determine whether the effect of chronic gbp also required its
uptake at the single-cell level (as outlined in fig. 2d), we
included the inhibitor 2-(⫺)-endoamino-bicycloheptene-2carboxylic acid (bch) in the medium, either alone or together
with gbp for 40 h. bch has a very low affinity for displacement
of gbp binding to ␣2␦-1 and ␣2␦-2 subunits (26), and it had no
effect on iba amplitude when applied alone  xxxd1891xxx  mm. the peak
current density at ⫹15 mv was ⫺330.2 ⫾ 84.7 pa/pf (n ⫽ 7) for
control and ⫺333.0 ⫾ 73.2 pa/pf (n ⫽ 8) in the presence of
bch. however, chronic bch prevented the effect of chronic
gbp both to reduce the expressed iba (fig. 2e) and to depolarize
its steady-state inactivation (data not shown). this effect of bch
is likely to result from its ability to block gbp uptake (18).
to obtain further evidence that gbp uptake is required for its
effect, we used xenopus oocytes, which express only a low level
of endogenous system-l transporter activity (27). we found that
chronic incubation with 200 ␮m gbp only significantly inhibited
 xxxg303xxx /␤1b/␣2␦-2 currents (by 57%, fig. 2f) when a system-l
transporter protein lat4 (27) was coexpressed. expression of
lat4 had no significant effect on the peak iba at ⫹5 mv, which
was ⫺0.49 ⫾ 0.12 ␮a (n ⫽ 34) and ⫺0.41 ⫾ 0.06 (n ⫽ 41) ␮a
in the absence and presence of lat4, respectively, from four
separate experiments.
we also found that chronic incubation of oocytes for 40 h in
the presence of  xxxd2460xxx  (400 ␮m) significantly enhanced iba
only when lat4 was coexpressed (fig. 2g). furthermore,
 xxxd2460xxx  did not enhance the small currents obtained in the
absence of ␣2␦, despite the presence of lat4 (fig. 2g). this is

mutation of a single amino acid, r217a, in an rrr motif in
␣2␦-1 (21, 22), or the equivalent residue r282a in ␣2␦-2 (23), has
been found almost completely to abrogate gbp binding. to
demonstrate that the effect of chronic gbp was indeed due to
binding to ␣2␦ subunits, we examined whether it would have any
effect on currents formed by  xxxg302xxx /␤4 cotransfected with
r282a-␣2␦-2. chronic incubation with gbp (1 mm) did not
inhibit these currents (fig. 2a) or result in any shift in the
steady-state inactivation (fig. 2b). furthermore, there was no
effect of gbp on currents formed with  xxxg303xxx /␤1b/r217a-␣2␦-1
(fig. 2c), or  xxxg302xxx /␤4/␣2␦-3 (peak iba was ⫺286.58 ⫾ 32.3
pa/pf at ⫹15 mv for control, n ⫽ 8; compared with ⫺258.7 ⫾
46.8 pa/pf for chronic gbp, n ⫽ 9). these results agree with the
fact that none of these ␣2␦ subunits bind gbp (data not shown).

compatible with the view that an endogenous low-molecularweight ligand, such as  xxxd2460xxx  itself, may normally occupy the
gbp-binding sites on ␣2␦-1 and ␣2␦-2 and be a positive modulator required for the full functionality of ␣2␦ subunits (1, 23).
the existence of an endogenous ligand was previously suggested
by the observation that the apparent affinity for gbp is increased by 5- to 10-fold upon dialysis or partial purification of
␣2␦ subunits (19, 23).
in agreement with this hypothesis, for both r217a-␣2␦-1 and
r282a-␣2␦-2, the peak currents were consistently smaller, compared with the wt ␣2␦ subunits, by ⬇62.5% and 34.5% respectively (see also refs. 23 and 28). however, they were significantly
greater than in the absence of any ␣2␦ subunit, where iba at ⫹15
mv was ⫺33.9 ⫾ 5.8 pa/pf for  xxxg303xxx /␤1b (n ⫽ 9, p ⬍ 0.05) and
⫺65.1 ⫾ 8.8 pa/pf for  xxxg302xxx /␤4 (n ⫽ 13, from ref. 24). this is
compatible with the hypothesis that the rra mutant ␣2␦
subunits are defective either in forward trafficking or in maintaining mature vgcc complexes at the plasma membrane.
chronic gbp reduces plasma membrane expression of calcium channels. to probe further whether gbp affected vgcc trafficking,

diagram illustrating some of the various sites at which gbp (red circles) or the
putative endogenous ligand (green circles) may act on ␣2␦ subunits. the effect
of gbp may be to displace an endogenous ligand and impair the ability of ␣2␦-1
and ␣2␦-2 to increase vgcc concentration at the plasma membrane. thus, gbp
may exert its effect on intracellular ␣2␦ subunits during maturation and
trafficking of the vgcc complex to the plasma membrane and/or bind to cell
surface ␣2␦ subunits and affect recycling from the plasma membrane. bch is

we then examined the subcellular distribution of vgcc subunits, using  xxxg302xxx  with an exofacial double hemagglutinin
(ha) tag ( xxxg302xxx –2ha, fig. 3 a–c). under control conditions,
 xxxg302xxx  and ␣2␦-2 were colocalized, both intracellularly (fig. 3a)
and also at the plasma membrane, as seen most clearly in
nonpermeabilized cells (fig. 3b). the plasma membrane expression in nonpermeabilized cells was quantified from lowmagnification images including those in fig. 3c, in which
cell-surface expression is seen across the entire cell because of
the depth of the optical section (4.5 ␮m for these images) and the
flattened nature of the cells. chronic incubation with 100 ␮m
and 1 mm gbp significantly reduced the expression of both
 xxxg302xxx  and ␣2␦-2 at the plasma membrane (fig. 3c) as well as
increasing the nonuniform intracellular clustering of both subunits (fig. 3a). a very similar result was observed for gfp–
 xxxg303xxx , which is expressed throughout transfected cos-7 cells,
typically showing a fairly uniform distribution [si fig. 7 (29)].
using permeabilized cells, we found that wt ␣2␦-2 colocalizes
with gfp- xxxg303xxx , both intracellularly and at the plasma membrane (si fig. 7ai). chronic gbp application resulted in regions
of intracellular clustering in most cells, both for ␣2␦-2 and for
gfp- xxxg303xxx  (si fig. 7a ii and iii, quantified in si fig. 7b).
to quantify further the effect of gbp on cell-surface expression of ␣2␦-2, we used cell-surface biotinylation and found that
chronic incubation with gbp (100 ␮m-1 mm) reduced the
proportion of ␣2␦-2 expressed at the cell surface (fig. 3d). the
biotinylation procedure did not induce cell permeabilization,
and this was not affected by chronic incubation with gbp,
because no biotinylation of the intracellular protein akt was
observed (fig. 3d).
in contrast, chronic gbp did not reduce the level of r282a␣2␦-2 expressed at the cell surface (si fig. 8a). furthermore, in
the presence of r282a-␣2␦-2, there was a less uniform distribution of both the mutant ␣2␦-2 and gfp- xxxg303xxx  than that seen

chronic gbp inhibits native calcium currents in drg neurons. to

determine the relevance of our findings to native vgccs in a
neuronal system relevant to the therapeutic use of gbp, we
examined whether gbp had a similar chronic effect on iba
density in cultured adult dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons.
we found a marked reduction in peak high voltage-activated
(hva) calcium currents (by 50.7 ⫾ 11.2% at 0 mv, n ⫽ 19, p ⫽
0.02), when drgs were incubated with 1 mm gbp for 3 days
(fig. 4a). contamination with t-type current was avoided by
measuring peak current from a holding potential of ⫺40 mv,
although a similar result was obtained when measuring iba at the
end of a 50-ms step from ⫺80 mv (fig. 4a). in contrast, acute
application of gbp for 10 min had no effect on adult drg iba
(fig. 4b).

subunits (19), the evidence is now very strong that gabapentinoid

proteins, immunoblotted with ␣2-2 (102–117) or akt ab. the leftmost lane is from
nonbiotinylated control cells (con). the proportion of ␣2␦-2 at the cell surface was
estimated from the ratio of the biotinylated ␣2␦-2 to the amount of ␣2␦-2 in the
wcl. data are from five experiments; 4.93 ⫾ 1.92% of total ␣2␦-2 was at the
plasma membrane, and this was reduced compared with control by 19.8 ⫾ 7.6%
and 30.4 ⫾ 14.4% in the chronic presence of 100 ␮m and 1 mm gbp, respectively
(n ⫽ 5, p ⬍ 0.05, repeated-measures anova and bonferroni’s post hoc test).

drugs have their therapeutic effect via this route, because an
r217a ␣2␦-1 knockin mouse develops neuropathic pain in
response to nerve injury, but this is unresponsive to either gbp
or its analog pregabalin (28). we now show that gbp is an
inhibitor of vgcc trafficking, rather than a direct inhibitor of
calcium currents, and thus exerts its inhibitory effects primarily
on intracellular ␣2␦ subunits. we have shown that ␣2␦ subunits
have their main effect on vgcc trafficking (30), and that the
 xxxg2423xxx -a (vwa) domain is key to this process.
it is notable that gbp binds to the two ␣2␦ subunits that have
vwa domains with perfect metal-ion adhesion site (midas)
motifs (31). it has been postulated that all such vwa domains
undergo a conformational change on binding the protein ligand
of this domain (30, 31), and one might speculate that gabapentinoid drugs could interfere with this function of the vwa
domain. the reduction in cell-surface expression of ␣2␦-2 and
 xxxg302xxx  in the presence of gbp and the reduced colocalization
of r282a-␣2␦-2 with  xxxg303xxx  provides supporting evidence for
this hypothesis.
the findings presented here could account for the lack of
effect, or small responses, reported to acute gbp in different
experimental systems, both on calcium currents and on synaptic
transmission (for review see ref. 1). previous studies examining
more prolonged exposure to gbp have also shown either no
inhibition or a small inhibition of current amplitude (32, 33). our
finding that the effect of gbp requires its uptake into individual
cells explains the requirement for a relatively high concentration
of gbp, because it will need to outcompete large neutral amino
acids for uptake at this site. it is clear that the trafficking of
vgccs and their insertion and removal from the plasma
membrane proceeds dynamically (see, for example, ref. 34), and
these rates are likely to depend on the physiological state of the
neurons, and the amount of ␣2␦ subunits present, which both
enhance forward trafficking and decrease the turnover of
vgccs (30, 35). insertion of vgccs into the plasma membrane
of presynaptic terminals or axons may occur rapidly under
certain conditions, for example, after the induction of neuropathic pain, when ␣2␦-1 subunit levels are elevated. in this
regard, it has been reported that gbp slowly inhibited calcium
currents over a period of minutes in drgs from ␣2␦-1overexpressing mice (mimicking the neuropathic pain state), but
not wt mice (36).

in conclusion, the action of gbp elucidated here, to inhibit
vgcc trafficking and plasma membrane expression, represents
a previously uncharacterized mechanism of drug action, and
points the way forward for development of screens for drug
development.
methods
tissue culture and heterologous expression of cdnas. details are provided in
si methods.
electrophysiology. calcium channel currents were recorded essentially as described (37, 38) and detailed in si methods.
immunoblotting. immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described
(30). sds/page-resolved samples were transferred to pvdf membranes and
probed with relevant primary abs as described (30) and with the appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary abs, followed by enhanced
chemiluminescence detection.
immunocytochemistry and imaging the method used is essentially as described
(39) and detailed in si methods.
biotinylation assay at 72 h after transfection with the cdnas described, cells
were rinsed three times with pbs and then incubated with pbs containing 1
mg/ml sulfo-nhs-ss-biotin (pierce) for 30 min at 4°c. the biotin solution was
removed and rinsed two times with pbs containing 100 mm glycine (ph 8.0) at
room temperature to quench the reaction. the cells were gently rinsed three
times with pbs and then lysed. half of the cell lysate was loaded onto a 3– 8%
tris-acetate gel to determine total protein expression. equal amounts of
biotinylated proteins were precipitated by adding 50 ␮l of streptavidin–
agarose beads (pierce) and incubated overnight at 4°c. the streptavidin–
agarose beads were washed three times and incubated with 100 mm dtt in
2⫻ laemmli sample buffer for 1 h at 37°c. eluted proteins were then resolved
by sds/page. immunoblotting for the cytosolic protein akt was used as a
control to determine that intracellular proteins were not biotinylated as a
result of cellular damage.
statistical analysis data are given as means ⫾ sem, and the statistical tests
used are either anova with bonferroni’s post hoc test or student’s two-tailed
t test, as stated.
