objective—the activity of the antitumoral agent  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ,  xxxd330xxx ) depends on its binding to the nuclear
retinoid-x receptor (rxr) and subsequent transcriptional regulation of target genes. through rxr activation,
 xxxd330xxx  may modulate numerous metabolic pathways involved in atherosclerosis. here, we investigated the effect of
 xxxd330xxx  on atherosclerosis progression in a dyslipidemic murine model, the human apolipoprotein e2 knockin
mouse, that develops essentially macrophage-laden lesions.
methods and results—atherosclerotic lesions together with different metabolic pathways involved in atherosclerosis were
investigated in mice treated or not with  xxxd330xxx .  xxxd330xxx  protects from atherosclerosis development in mice, at
least in part by improving the circulating cholesterol distribution profile likely via a marked decrease of dietary
cholesterol absorption caused by modulation of intestinal expression of genes recently identified as major players in this
process, niemann-pick-c1-like1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) and  xxxg163xxx . this atheroprotection appears despite a strong hypertriglyceridemia. moreover,  xxxd330xxx  treatment only modestly modulates inflammatory gene expression in the vascular wall,
but markedly enhanced the capacity of macrophages to efflux cellular lipids.
conclusion—these data provide evidence of a favorable pharmacological effect of  xxxd330xxx  on atherosclerosis despite
the induction of hypertriglyceridemia, likely via a beneficial action on intestinal absorption and macrophage efflux.

exarotene [ xxxd330xxx , 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8pentamethyl-2-naphtalenyl) ethenyl]  xxxd306xxx ] is an
antitumoral agent used as chemotherapy in the treatment of
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma.1  xxxd330xxx  is currently being
evaluated for the treatment of other cancers1 and psoriasis.2
thus,  xxxd330xxx  is both an element of the current antitumoral therapeutic arsenal and a molecule with emerging and
promising effects in various pathologies.
atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory pathology of
the vascular wall, precipitated by systemic factors, such as
qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of circulating lipids
and lipoproteins. blood lipid concentrations reflect an equilibrium between absorption of dietary lipids in the small
intestine, production after endogenous synthesis in the liver,
and removal by different peripheral tissues and the liver. in
pathological conditions, circulating atherogenic lipoproteins
can be taken up by macrophages in the vascular wall, thus
initiating an inflammatory process leading to a progressive

evolution of atherosclerosis. through the action of locally
produced cytokines and other inflammatory proteins leading
to cell migration and proliferation, the vascular wall is
continuously remodeled. atherosclerosis progressively
evolves from the simple fatty streak to advanced atherosclerotic plaques, which may ultimately lead to plaque rupture
and thrombus formation.
the pharmacological responses to  xxxd330xxx  originate
from the transcriptional control of gene programs via activation of a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the
retinoid-x receptor (rxr). as other nuclear receptors, rxr
acts as a transcription factor that, on activation by binding of
a specific ligand, binds to gene regulatory dna sequences
and subsequently modulates the transcription of target genes.
a growing number of studies have reported effects of rxr
ligands on plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations,
cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, matrix remodeling,
and inflammation, all of which impinge on atherogenesis.3–5

a beneficial effect on atherogenesis in vivo has been reported
only once, with the rexinoid lg100364, a molecule that was
never further developed, and thus has no clinical applications, in
the  xxxg177xxx  (apoe) knockout (apoe-ko) mouse.6 in the
present report, we studied the apoe2-ki mouse model, which
differs from the apoe-ko mouse model, because it rather
develops a mixed dyslipidemia combining hypertriglyceridemia
and hypercholesterolemia as frequently found in humans,
whereas apoe-ko mice are characterized by an isolated hypercholesterolemia. furthermore, apoe2-ki mice appear a better
pharmacological model to test agonists of nuclear receptors than
apoe2-ko mice.7 because the concept of selective nuclear
receptor modulator (snrm) agonists, which postulates that
different agonists of a nuclear receptor lead to overlapping but
also distinct biological effects, also pertains to rxr modulators
and because apoe2-ki mice display hypertriglyceridemia that is
exacerbated by rexinoid treatment as observed in humans treated
with rexinoids, we decided to study the effects of  xxxd330xxx , a
rexinoid used in humans, on atherosclerosis and related metabolic pathways in the apoe2-ki model.
we show here that  xxxd330xxx  protects apoe2-ki mice
from atherosclerotic lesion development, despite a marked
increase in triglycerides, at least in part, by decreasing the
atherogenic cholesterol-containing lipoprotein fraction likely
due to a marked decrease of dietary cholesterol absorption in
relation to decreased intestinal expression of niemann-pick
c1-like1 ( xxxg1583xxx )8 and  xxxg163xxx .9  xxxd330xxx  treatment only
modestly modulates the expression of inflammatory genes in
the vascular wall, but enhanced the capacity of macrophages
to efflux cellular lipids. thus pharmacological atheroprotection can be obtained despite triglyceride elevation when
atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations decrease.

materials and methods
animals and treatment
homozygous female human apoe2-ki mice on a c57bl6 genetic
background were used.10 the animal experiments were performed
according to the institutional guidelines. mice were euthanized by
cervical dislocation.
 xxxd330xxx  was synthesized in the laboratoire de chimie pharmaceutique (faculté des sciences pharmaceutiques, université de
lille 2, france).
in three different experiments, 2 separate groups of apoe2-ki
mice were matched for age. doses of  xxxd330xxx , within the range of
doses previously used in rodents,11 efficient on lipid parameters and
nontoxic during the treatment duration were used.
twenty-four mice (n⫽12/group) aged 7 to 10 weeks were fed a
western-style diet containing 0.2% cholesterol and 21% fat (safe,
augy, france) supplemented or not with  xxxd330xxx  (0.018% wt/wt)
for 11 weeks. based on food consumption, this dose corresponds to
⬇35 mg per kg. at the end of the treatment, blood was collected by
retro-orbital venipuncture under isoflurane anesthesia after 4 hours
of fasting (9:00 am to 1:00 pm) and plasma was separated. livers and
intestines were removed, duodenum and jejunum separated, longitudinally opened, and enterocytes were scrapped. hearts were
removed and treated as further described.
sixteen chow fed mice (n⫽8/group) aged 6 months were dosed for
14 days with  xxxd330xxx  (300 mpk) or with vehicle alone (carboxymethylcellulose 1%/ xxxd2982xxx  [peg] 400/tween, 90/9.95/
0.05, by volume). hearts were removed and the upper half containing the aortic sinus was sectioned at a plane parallel to a line drawn
between the tips of the atria. the intestine was removed and
enterocytes obtained as noted.

sixteen chow diet fed mice (n⫽8/group) aged 6 months were
dosed once daily first with  xxxd330xxx  (300 mpk) or vehicle
(carboxymethylcellulose 1%/peg 400/tween, 90/9.95/0.05, by volume) for 5 days, and then with a single dose of [14c]cholesterol (1
␮ci) and [3h]sitostanol (2 ␮ci) in 150 ␮l of olive oil. the mice
were subsequently dosed once daily with  xxxd330xxx  or vehicle for 4
additional days, totaling 9 consecutive treatment days. feces were
collected during the 4 last days to calculate intestinal cholesterol
absorption (see http://atvb.ahajournals.org).

specific staining of the lesions, macrophage content was
reduced on  xxxd330xxx  treatment and colocalized with oilred-o–stained areas (data not shown).

 xxxd330xxx  increases plasma triglyceride
concentrations in apoe2-ki mice
compared with controls,  xxxd330xxx -treated mice showed a
marked increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations
(⫹50%, p⬍0.001) (figure 2a). the triglyceride distribution
profile showed that triglycerides were associated with verylow-density lipoprotein (vldl) (data not shown). to analyze
the mechanisms involved in this increase, the hepatic expression of proteins controlling triglyceride metabolism were
measured. stearyl- xxxd1739xxx  (coa) desaturase 1 ( xxxg2014xxx )
and  xxxg765xxx  (fas) are lipogenic enzymes, whereas
angiopoietin-like 3 (angptl3) is implicated in triglyceride
catabolism. the expression of genes encoding  xxxg2014xxx  and
fas was strongly increased in livers of treated mice as
compared with controls (p⬍0.001), whereas angptl3 mrna
was only slightly increased (p⬍0.05) (figure 2b).
because the activity of  xxxg2014xxx  can be evaluated by determining the ratio of  xxxd2777xxx  to  xxxd3244xxx  (desaturation
index; c18:1/ xxxd3244xxx ),12 the fatty acid composition of cholesteryl esters in plasma was measured (see http://atvb.
ahajournals.org, table ii). expressed as percentage of total
fatty acid mass in cholesteryl esters, saturated  xxxd2154xxx  with
16 and 18 carbon atoms were significantly decreased
(p⬍0.001) in treated mice, whereas monounsaturated fatty
acids with the same number of carbons were unchanged,
leading to a significant increase of the ratios c18:1/ xxxd3244xxx  and
c16:1/ xxxd2833xxx , indicative of an enhanced  xxxg2014xxx  activity.

 xxxd330xxx  decreases atherogenic
cholesterol-containing lipoproteins in
apoe2-ki mice
 xxxd330xxx -treated mice exhibited a reduction in total cholesterol levels (p⬍0.05), which was entirely caused by
reduced non– high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol
concentrations (p⬍0.01), whereas hdl cholesterol levels
were comparable in treated and control mice (figure 3a).
cholesterol distribution profile analysis in control mice (figure 3b) clearly showed that in the apoe2-ki mouse model,
cholesterol is mainly transported by vldl, intermediarydensity lipoprotein (idl), and low-density lipoprotein (ldl),
whereas the hdl fraction represents only ⬇20% of total
cholesterol as previously observed.13 treatment with  xxxd330xxx  led to a decrease in non-hdl cholesterol exclusively by
decreasing the idl–ldl fraction without any change in the
hdl fraction (figure 3b). the reduction of the atherogenic
cholesterol-rich remnant particles in treated mice was associated with reduced plasma concentrations of its main protein
component, apob (p⬍0.01) (figure 3c), but hepatic apob
mrna levels were unchanged (figure 3d). because marked
changes were observed in the cholesterol distribution profile
in treated mice, the mechanisms that could explain these
modifications were further analyzed by measuring the hepatic
expression of genes controlling cholesterol homeostasis.
while  xxxg1318xxx  mrna levels were markedly enhanced
(p⬍0.001) in treated mice as compared with controls (figure

suggesting that hepatic removal of ldl from circulation

in cholesterol synthesis.

 xxxd330xxx  decreases intestinal cholesterol
absorption and modulates expression of intestinal
genes in apoe2-ki mice
to gain insight in the mechanisms underlying the reduced
ldl/idl levels in treated mice, intestinal cholesterol absorption
was determined.  xxxd330xxx  treatment led to a 64% reduction of
cholesterol absorption efficiency (p⬍0.001) (figure 4). since
 xxxg1583xxx  and  xxxg163xxx  have recently been identified as critical
components of the intestinal cholesterol absorption machinery,
intestinal mrna levels of these genes were measured.  xxxg1583xxx 
and  xxxg163xxx  mrna levels were significantly decreased in both
duodenum and jejunum of  xxxd330xxx -treated mice as compared
with controls (figure 5). in addition, as  xxxg9xxx  has been shown
to be implicated in intestinal cholesterol metabolism, its expression was also measured.  xxxg9xxx  mrna levels were significantly lower in treated mice than in controls (figure 5). com-

interestingly, mice fed a western diet displayed an increased
number of oil-red-o–stained peritoneal macrophages (73% of
total cells) compared with mice fed a chow diet (14% of total
cells), and  xxxd330xxx -treatment strongly reduced (33% of total
cells) the western diet-induced lipid-loading of these peritoneal
macrophages (figure 6a). to further analyze the mechanism,
cholesterol-loaded peritoneal macrophages isolated from
apoe2-ki mice and in vitro treated with  xxxd330xxx  were
incubated with either  xxxg1335xxx -i or hdl as cholesterol acceptors,
and cellular cholesterol efflux was measured. the cholesterol
efflux was significantly higher in  xxxd330xxx -treated macrophages than in controls whatever the acceptor (p⬍0.05) (figure
6b). because  xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg21xxx  are the main cholesterol
transporters mediating  xxxg1335xxx -i– dependent and hdl-dependent
cholesterol efflux pathways, respectively, the expression of these
transporters was compared in the aortic sinus of bexarotenetreated and control mice. the mrna levels of both proteins
were significantly induced by  xxxd330xxx  treatment (p⬍0.01)
(figure 6c).

the expression of genes encoding several molecules implicated in the inflammatory process was measured in the

14-day treatment with  xxxd330xxx . at this age, female
apoe2-ki mice display large macrophage-laden lesions in
the aortic sinus (personal unpublished results), which
allows to study gene expression in the context of inflammatory protein producing cells. monocyte chemoattractant

 xxxd330xxx  treatment induces effects both on systemic plasma

plasma cholesterol concentrations coincides with a decrease in
intestinal cholesterol absorption, which is associated with a
reduced intestinal gene expression of  xxxg1583xxx  and  xxxg163xxx .
indeed, npcl1 has been recently identified as a target of the
hypocholesterolemic drug ezetimibe through regulating intestinal cholesterol absorption.14 –18 thus, inhibiting  xxxg1583xxx  activity by ezetimibe in apoe-ko mice14 or gene expression by
 xxxd330xxx  in apoe2-ki mice leads to a decreased susceptibility
to atherosclerosis.  xxxg163xxx  has been identified as a molecule
potentially implicated in cholesterol absorption19 and could also
be a molecular target of ezetimibe.9 interestingly,  xxxd330xxx 
decreased the expression of  xxxg9xxx  in the intestine. this result
differs from observation with an other rexinoid, lg268, showing an increased  xxxg9xxx  expression in the intestine associated
with a decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption.20 however,
the potential effect of  xxxg9xxx  in cholesterol absorption has been
highly debated21–23 and a recent study24 showed its implication
in intestinal hdl biogenesis.
one level of complexity of rxr biology relates to its ability
to activate transcription as an obligate partner of heterodimerization with many nuclear receptors. thus,  xxxd330xxx  activation
of rxr could elicit responses of the permissive heterodimers
and thus modulate cholesterol absorption. the question addressing which partner(s) of heterodimerization modulate the  xxxd330xxx  responses in intestinal cholesterol absorption is still open.
despite being expressed in the intestine, peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (ppar)␣ is unlikely to be involved, because a previous study showed no effect of its
activation on  xxxg1583xxx  gene expression.25 conversely, ppar␦
could be implicated because  xxxg1583xxx  is known to be reduced in
the intestine on ppar␦ activation.16 however, ppar␦ mrna
levels are decreased in  xxxd330xxx -treated mice as compared
with controls (data not shown), suggesting the existence of an
alternative partner. finally, the most attractive partner of rxr
heterodimerization in the intestine is the liver-x receptor (lxr).
indeed,  xxxg1583xxx  is reduced after lxr activation.25 surprisingly, expression of the  xxxg9xxx  gene, a positive lxr target
gene, is decreased in the intestine of  xxxd330xxx -treated mice. in
addition, expression of abcg5 and abcg8, other wellcharacterized lxr target genes,26 are also decreased in the
intestine of  xxxd330xxx -treated mice (data not shown). interestingly, treatment with  xxxd330xxx  did increase aortic  xxxg9xxx 
expression, but only modestly altered expression of genes
implicated in the parietal inflammatory process, whereas lxr
activation has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects.27
thus it is unclear to what extent the lxr/rxr pathway
mediates the effects of  xxxd330xxx  and  xxxd330xxx  certainly acts
as a selective, tissue-specific, and gene-specific modulator of the
lxr/rxr pathway.
cholesterol efflux, the obligatory first step of reverse cholesterol transport, is a “bi-partner process.” on the one side are the
acceptors of cholesterol, namely lipoproteins present in plasma
and intercellular fluids, and on the other side the cells and their
cholesterol transporters. among them,  xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg21xxx 
have been shown to specifically mediate cholesterol efflux from
cells to lipid-poor  xxxg1335xxx -i and to hdl, respectively.28,29 treating
mice with  xxxd330xxx  did not significantly modify the capacity
of plasma to accept cholesterol from cells ex vivo. by contrast,
in vitro incubation of murine cholesterol-laden peritoneal mac-

rophages with  xxxd330xxx  resulted in a significant increase of
lipid-free  xxxg1335xxx -i-mediated cholesterol efflux. moreover,  xxxd330xxx  enhanced cholesterol efflux mediated by hdl, suggesting that both  xxxg9xxx  and  xxxg21xxx -mediated cholesterol efflux
are facilitated on treatment of macrophages in vitro. finally, the
expression of these cholesterol transporters was enhanced in the
aortic sinus, ie, the area enriched in macrophages, on in vivo
treatment. moreover, in vivo treatment decreased the number of
lipid-loaded peritoneal macrophages, which correlates with less
lipid-loading of the cell population present in the atherosclerotic
lesions. taken together, our present results suggest that macrophages in the aortic sinus of treated mice display enhanced
capacity to efflux cholesterol, thus preventing foam cell formation and subsequent lesion development.
as the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis has been
increasingly recognized at all stages of its pathogenesis, we
measured the expression of genes encoding different cytokines
and proteins implicated in the inflammatory process and previously shown to be regulated in vitro by retinoids (natural rxr
ligands) or rexinoids (synthetic rxr ligands).30 –34  xxxd330xxx 
treatment induced only modest variations in the genes encoding
 xxxg357xxx  and macrophage  xxxg526xxx , two strong
modulators of foam cell formation. in addition, in the subcutaneous dorsal pouch acute inflammatory model,35  xxxd330xxx 
treatment did not exert any anti-inflammatory activity (data not
shown) indicating that  xxxd330xxx  has no marked effect in the
inflammatory process in the vascular wall in vivo.
in our model,  xxxd330xxx -treatment induced a marked increase in triglyceridemia as it does in humans.1 our results
demonstrate that the biosynthesis of triglycerides could be
affected by  xxxd330xxx  treatment, because hepatic expression of
 xxxg2014xxx  and fas was increased. interestingly, these genes are
targets of the lxr/rxr heterodimer and lxr agonists also
increase hepatic lipogenesis and plasma triglycerides.36  xxxg2014xxx 
protein activity appeared also increased by  xxxd330xxx  treatment,
as assessed by the higher desaturation index (c18:1/ xxxd3244xxx ) of
plasma cholesteryl esters in treated mice as compared with
controls. in addition, the slight increase of hepatic expression of
angptl3, a protein identified as an inhibitor of lipoprotein–
lipase,37 the enzyme responsible for catabolism of triglycerides
in the vascular compartment, could also enhance the triglyceridemia. although epidemiological and clinical studies demonstrated the association of elevated plasma triglyceride levels with
increased risk of cardiovascular disease,38 it is interesting to note
that increasing plasma triglyceride levels, as observed not only
after  xxxd330xxx  but also lxr agonist treatment, is not sufficient
to aggravate atherosclerosis progression when associated with a
decrease in non-hdl cholesterol and an improvement of lipid
homeostasis in macrophages.

the rxr agonist  xxxd330xxx  improves cholesterol homeostasis and inhibits
atherosclerosis progression in a mouse model of mixed dyslipidemia.
by fanny lalloyer et al.
supplementary information published online

1) materials and methods
lipid and lipoprotein analyses
plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (tc) and triglycerides (tg) were
measured using commercially available kits (biomerieux, france). hdl cholesterol
(hdl-c)

concentrations

apolipoprotein

(apo)

were

determined

b-containing

in

lipoproteins

plasma
by

after

precipitation

phosphotungstic

of

acid/mg

(boehringer mannheim, germany). non-hdl cholesterol (n-hdl-c) was obtained by
subtraction of hdl-c values from tc.
lipoproteins were separated from 200 µl of pooled plasma by gel filtration
chromatography using a superose 6 hr 10/30 column (pharmacia, sweden). the
gel was allowed to equilibrate with 10 mm phosphate–buffered saline (pbs)
containing 0.01% (wt/vol) edta and 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium azide. plasma was eluted
with the buffer at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.2 ml.min-1. the effluents were
collected in 0.22-ml fractions. cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were
determined in the eluted fractions as described above.
plasma levels of mouse b were measured by immunonephelometric assays using
specific polyclonal antibodies.

fatty acid composition of plasma cholesteryl esters.
lipids were extracted from plasma according to the folch method (folch et al.). the
lipid extract was dried under nitrogen, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v:v),
and separated by thin layer chromatography using petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid
(90:10:5, v:v:v). cholesteryl esters were identified by simultaneous migration of
standards. cholesteryl esters were scrapped, hydrolysed and the resulting  xxxd2154xxx 
were methylated by treatment with methalonic h2so4 for 2 h at 70°c. the fatty acid
methyl esters were extracted with heptane and analysed by gas chromatography on
a varian 3400 chromatograph (palo alto, ca) equipped with a flame ionisation
detector and a capillary column. a gradient temperature from 160°c to 210°c at
1.5°c min-1 and a n2 pressure of 85 kpa were used. identification of  xxxd2154xxx  was
achieved using commercially available fatty acid methyl esters.

quantification of atherosclerotic lesions
after euthanasia, the heart was perfused from its apex with cold krebs-ringer buffer
and fixed in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs, ph 7.4. the heart,
containing the aortic origin, was carefully removed and fixed in paraformaldehyde
overnight. the upper half of the heart was equilibrated in 30% sucrose, embedded in
tissue-tek oct compound and frozen in liquid nitrogen in combination with
isopentane. serial 10-µm-thick cryosections were obtained from the aortic arch to the
ventricles and were used for detection of lipid deposition using oil red o and
hematoxylin. quantitative analysis of the atherosclerotic lesion area including the

positive oil red o staining area was performed every 5 sections, each 50 µm apart.
images were captured by use of a jvc 3-ccd video camera and analysed blindly by
one observer using computer assisted-quips image analysis system from leica
(leica mikroskopic und system gmbh, wetzlar, germany). to avoid morphological
heterogeneity between mice, the expression of average atherosclerotic lesion areas
of the aortic root, from the appearance to the disappearance of the aortic valves, was
normalized at ten equal sections.

cholesterol efflux experiments
cellular cholesterol efflux ability of plasma was determined using fu5ah rat
hepatoma cells following the procedure described by de la llera moya et al. briefly,
the cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf
serum. fu5ah were plated on 24 multiwell plates (bd, le pont de claix, france)
using 1 ml per well. two days after plating, cellular cholesterol was labelled during a
72 hour-incubation with 3h-cholesterol (amersham, orsay, france) (0.5 µci/well). to
allow equilibration of the label, the cells were washed and incubated for 24 hours in
minimal essential medium with 0.5% wt/vol bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa). then the
cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and incubated at 37°c for 4
hours with 2.5% (v:v) diluted plasma. at the end of the incubation, the medium was
removed and centrifuged. the monolayer cells were washed 3 times with pbs and
harvested with 0.5 ml of 1 mol/l naoh. radioactivity was then measured in both
medium and cells, and percentage of cholesterol efflux calculated. measurements
were performed in triplicate.
thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages plated at 105 cells/ml were
loaded with 50 µg/ml [3h] acetylated low-density lipoproteins for 24 h in serum-free

dmem containing 0.2 % (v:v) bsa. loaded cells were then washed, activated for 24
hours with  xxxd330xxx  (1µm) and efflux was initiated in medium containing 10 µg/ml
of human apo a-i or 30 µg/ml of human hdl3 isolated from plasma by
ultracentrifugation at density 1.063<d<1.21. twenty-four hours later, the medium was
removed and centrifuged to remove cell debris. the cells were dissolved in 1 m
naoh. radioactivity was then measured in both medium and cells, and percentage
of cholesterol efflux calculated. measurements were performed in triplicate.

and transfer. arterioscler thromb 1994;14:1056-1065.

analysis of lipid-loading of peritoneal macrophages
mouse peritoneal macrophages (mpms) were collected by peritoneal lavage with
pbs from mice given a 3-ml intraperitoneal injection of 4% thioglycollate in water.
the mpms were pelleted, washed twice with serum-free rpmi (gibco), plated at a
density of 1.5x106 cells/35-mm dish, and allowed to adhere to dishes for 2 hours in
rpmi. then, plates were washed 3 times with pbs to remove nonadherent cells.
lipids were stained by oil-red-o according to the method of lillie and ashburn
(1943). cells were counterstained with hematoxylin.

intestinal cholesterol absorption
intestinal cholesterol absorption was measured by the dual fecal isotope ratio
method, as described by wang and carey. fecal lipids were extracted and

[14c]cholesterol and [3h]sitostanol levels determined. the ratio of the two
radiolabeled isotopes in the fecal extracts and the dosing mixture was used for
calculation of percent cholesterol absorption :

% absorption =

[14c] / [3h] dosing mixture - [14c] / [3h] feces

x 100

[14c] / [3h] dosing mixture

real-time pcr-based quantitative gene expression analysis
total

rna

by

the

acid

guanidium

thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method as previously described (chomczynski 1987)
and reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and superscript reverse
transcriptase (life technologies, france). for quantitative pcr, reverse transcribed
cdna were quantified by real-time pcr on a mx 4000 apparatus (stratagene), using
specific oligonucleotide primers listed in table 1. pcr amplification was performed in
a volume of 25 µl containing 100 nm of each primer, 4 mm mgcl2, the brilliant
quantitative pcr core reagent mix as recommended by the manufacturer
(stratagene), and sybr green 0.33 x (sigma-aldrich, france). the conditions were
95°c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec at 95°c, 30 sec at 55°c, and 30 sec
at 72°c. all samples are run in duplicate. results are expressed normalized to 28s
rna.
