effect of leptin administration versus re-feeding
on hypothalamic neuropeptide gene expression in
fasted male rats
edward d. mcalister and dean a. van vugt

abstract: adipocytes are the primary source of circulating leptin. leptin inhibits eating, increases metabolism, and
stimulates the reproductive axis. numerous hypothalamic neuropeptides have been implicated in leptin’s behavioral and
neuroendocrine effects, including  xxxg1590xxx  (npy) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (cart).
the aim of this study was to investigate the physiological relevance of leptin’s signaling of nutritional status by comparing the effects of leptin with the effects of re-feeding on fasting-induced changes in the expression of the long form
of the  xxxg1320xxx  (ob-rb), npy, and cart. adult male rats were fasted for 48 h and treated with either intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) leptin throughout the fast, or fed ad libitum for 24 h after terminating the
fast. expression of npy, ob-rb, and cart mrna in the arcuate nucleus (arc) was determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry and compared with vehicle-treated fed or fasted controls. fasting increased npy and ob-rb expression and decreased cart expression in the arc. leptin (regardless of route) and re-feeding were equally effective in
normalizing cart mrna expression. a similar trend was observed with ob-rb expression. in contrast, neither refeeding nor s.c. leptin reversed the increased expression of npy that was induced by fasting. only i.c.v. leptin was effective in this regard. our results indicate leptin and re-feeding are equally effective in normalizing fasting-induced
changes in cart and ob-rb expression, but less effective in normalizing npy expression. these results suggest that
leptin is the primary nutritional signal regulating cart and ob-rb expression in the arc, and highlight potential differences between cart and npy neuron sensitivity to leptin signaling.

résumé : les adipocytes constituent une source essentielle de leptine circulante. la leptine inhibe la prise alimentaire,
augmente le métabolisme et stimule l’axe reproducteur. de nombreux neuropeptides hypothalamiques ont été mis en
cause dans les effets neuroendocriniens et comportementaux de la leptine, dont le  xxxg1590xxx  (npy) et le transcrit
régulé par la cocaïne et l’amphétamine (cart). la présente étude a eu pour but d’examiner la pertinence physiologique de la signalisation de l’état nutritionnel par la leptine, en comparant les effets de la leptine avec à ceux de la reprise alimentaire sur les variations induites par le jeûne dans l’expression de la forme longue du récepteur de la leptine
(ob-rb), de npy et de cart. des rats mâles adultes ont été soumis à un jeûne de 48 heures et ont reçu de la leptine
par voie intracérébroventriculaire (i.c.v.) ou sous-cutanée (s.c.) pendant la durée du jeûne, ou ont été nourris ad libitum
pendant 24 heures après la levée du jeûne. l’expression des arnm de npy, ob-rb et cart dans le noyau arqué
(arq) a été déterminée par histochimie et hybridation in situ et comparée à celle de témoins nourris avec un véhicule
ou à jeun. le jeûne a augmenté l’expression de npy et ob-rb et diminué celle de cart dans le noyau arq. la leptine (peu importe la voie d’administration) et la reprise alimentaire ont normalisé aussi efficacement l’expression de
l’arnm de cart. une tendance similaire a été observée pour l’expression de ob-rb. en revanche, ni la reprise alimentaire ni la leptine s.c. n’ont renversé l’augmentation de l’expression de npy induite par le jeûne. seule la leptine
i.c.v. a été efficace à cet égard. nos résultats indiquent que la leptine et la reprise alimentaire sont aussi efficaces pour
normaliser les variations de l’expression de cart et ob-rb induites par le jeûne, mais qu’elles le sont moins pour
normaliser l’expression de npy. ces résultats donnent à penser que la leptine est le signal nutritionnel régulant l’expression de cart et ob-rb dans le noyau arq et ils mettent en lumière les différences potentielles entre la sensibilité des neurones cart et npy à la signalisation par la leptine.

introduction
the leptin gene was first cloned and sequenced in mice
and humans in 1994 (zhang et al. 1994). leptin is a 16 kda
peptide that has diverse physiological roles including regulation of appetite, metabolism, and reproduction (friedman
2002). leptin levels correlate with adiposity, and are reduced with acute fasting (weigle et al. 1997). the ob/ob
mouse is hyperphagic, obese, and infertile due to leptin deficiency (halaas et al. 1995). leptin administration to ob/ob,
wild-type, and diet-induced obese mice reduces food intake
and induces weight loss (barash et al. 1996; campfield et al.
1995; overton et al. 2001; ruffin and nicolaidis 2000;
stephens et al. 1995; wang et al. 1999). the effects of leptin
are mediated primarily through the long form of the leptin
receptor (ob-rb) (ghilardi and skoda 1997). highest levels
of ob-rb mrna are present in the arcuate nucleus (arc)
of the hypothalamus, and expression levels are typically inversely related to leptin signaling (baskin et al. 1998).
leptin is thought to regulate food intake by an action on
both orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides. two key
mediators appear to be  xxxg1590xxx  (npy) and cocaineand amphetamine-regulated transcript (cart). cart is
widely expressed in the cns (elias et al. 2001). intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of cart reduces food intake
(kristensen et al. 1998; larsen et al. 2000; rohnerjeanrenaud et al. 2002). cart expression is reduced when
leptin signaling is low, as occurs in fasted rodents, ob/ob
mice, and fa/fa rats (kristensen et al. 1998; robson et al.
2002; tsuruta et al. 2002). cart expression increases in
situations of hyperleptinemia as occurs in a(y)/a hyperleptinemic obese mice (tsuruta et al. 2002). based on these
observations, it is concluded that cart expression in the
arc is under the stimulatory control of leptin. in contrast,
npy is an orexigenic neuropeptide that is under the inhibitory control of leptin. npy is a 36 amino acid peptide with
high concentrations in the paraventricular nucleus (pvn)
and in the arc (chronwall et al. 1985; magoul and tramu
2000; tatemoto et al. 1982). npy-producing neurons in the
arc project to the pvn where npy release is highest in
rats prior to feeding and decreases throughout the course of
feeding (bai et al. 1985; kalra et al. 1991). npy administration stimulates eating in satiated rats (kalra et al. 1988),
while injection of npy directly into the pvn increases food
intake dose dependently (stanley et al. 1986; stanley and
leibowitz 1985). npy expression in the arc is increased
during hypoleptinemic states such as in the ob/ob mouse and
fasted rodents (baskin et al. 1999a; schwartz et al. 1996;
swart et al. 2002), whereas npy expression is reduced following leptin administration (wang et al. 1997; ahima et al.
1999). these effects of leptin on npy and cart are likely
direct because npy and cart neurons in the arc coexpress ob-rb (baskin et al. 1999a; elias et al. 2001).
changes in npy, cart, and  xxxg1320xxx  expression following
an acute fast were well documented. however, all 3 transcripts have not been measured in the same study in response to both an acute-fasting protocol and re-feeding. the
objective of the current study was to determine if changes in
leptin signaling were accompanied by coordinated changes
in orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides. this was accomplished by comparing npy, cart, and ob-rb mrna levels

1129

in the arc of fed male rats (normal leptin signaling) with
mrna levels during either low or high leptin signaling
achieved by a 48-h fast with and without leptin replacement
or following a 24-h period of re-feeding. we postulated that
hypoleptinemia induced by a 48-h fast would result in reduced leptin signaling as reflected by increased ob-rb expression, and that it would reduce cart and increase npy
mrna levels in the arc. we further postulated that the reduced cart and increased npy expression would be prevented by leptin administration or reversed by re-feeding.
determining the fidelity of cart, npy, and ob-rb gene
expression under these different conditions of leptin signaling would improve our understanding of the physiological
importance of anorexigenic and orexigenic inputs to appetite
regulation.

materials and methods
adult male sprague-dawley rats (charles river, canadian
breeding farm and laboratories, montreal, que.) were
housed in a light (lights on 0600–1800 h) and temperature
(24 °c) controlled room. their weight upon arrival was approximately 225 g. they were allowed ad lib access to food
(rodent laboratory chow, purina mills inc., st. louis, mo.)
and water until the start of the study. rats were acclimatized
and handled for at least 2 weeks prior to surgery. all animal
care practices and experimental procedures adhered to the
guidelines of the canadian council on animal care and
were approved by the queen’s university animal use committee.
fasting and re-feeding protocols
rats were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 5
groups: (i) fed controls (n = 4), (ii) fasted for 48 h (n = 4),
(iii) fasted for 48 h and infused intracerebroventricularly
(i.c.v.) with 2 µg of leptin per day (n = 4), (iv) fasted for
48 h and infused subcutaneously (s.c.) with 48 µg of leptin
per day (n = 4), (iv) fasted for 48 h followed by 24 h of unlimited access to food (n = 3). all groups received water ad
libitum. half of the rats in group 1 and group 2 received s.c.
acsf and half received i.c.v. acsf. pumps were implanted
24 h prior to initiating the study to allow time for pump activation. rats were weighed at the start and end of the protocol.
leptin infusion
alzet osmotic minipumps (alzet, durect corporation, cupertino, calif., model 2001, infusion rate 1 µl/h) were used
to deliver leptin (recombinant murine leptin, peprotech,
rocky hills, n.j.). leptin for i.c.v. administration was dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) to a concentration of 83.3 µg/ml. the i.c.v. cannula was filled with the
appropriate solution prior to pump attachment to prevent a
delay in the administration of leptin or acsf due to cannula
void volume (approximately 10 µl). pumps were inserted s.c. through a 1-cm incision on the dorsum. the incision was closed with surgical staples. this protocol
delivered leptin i.c.v. at a rate of 2 µg per day (approximately 5.5 µg/(kg·day)). selection of this dose was based on
the report that 0.5–10 µg leptin injected into the lateral ventricle inhibited food intake (widdowson et al. 1997). for s.c.

leptin infusion, leptin was dissolved in 10 mmol/l nacitrate
(ph 4.0) to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. pumps were
inserted s.c. through a 1 cm incision on the dorsum. the incision was closed with surgical staples. this protocol delivered leptin s.c. at a rate of 48 µg per day (approximately
132 µg/(kg·day)), and was shown to produce physiological
levels of leptin in rats (ahima et al. 1999).
placement of lateral ventricular cannulas
cannulation of the lateral ventricle was performed 1 week
prior to initiation of the experiment. the protocol used was
adapted from a technique previously described (de balbian
verster et al. 1971; van vugt et al. 1989). briefly, rats were
anaesthetized with a sterile mixture of 25% ketamine, 25%
xylazine, and 10%  xxxd60xxx  at a dose of 0.1 cc per
100 g. the calvarium was exposed and a hole drilled 2 mm
lateral and 1 mm caudal to the bregma. the cannula consisted of 8 cm length of polyethylene tubing (pe-50; clay
adams, parsippany, n.j.) and was inserted to a depth of
5 mm and fixed to the calvaria with dental cement. once the
dental cement hardened, the tubing was passed s.c. down the
dorsum of the rat using a blunted 18 gauge needle inserted
through a small midline incision on the posterior surface of
the neck. the skull incision was closed with surgical staples.
proper placement of the cannula was confirmed by visual inspection at the time of brain sectioning.
perfusion and tissue preparation
at the completion of the protocol, rats were anaesthetized
and an abdominal incision made. the descending aorta was
clamped, and a 25-gauge angiocatheter was inserted into the
left ventricle to perfuse the brain with diethyl-pyrocarbonate
(depc)-treated phosphate buffered saline (4 °c) at a rate of
6 ml per min to a total volume of 20 ml. the right atrium
was concurrently incised. brains were fixed by perfusion
with depc-treated 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/l borax (ph 9.5) at a rate of 6 ml per minute to a total volume
of 60 ml, after which rats were decapitated and the brain removed.
following perfusion, brains were post-fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4 °c for 24 h before changing to 30%
sucrose in 4% paraformaldehyde until sinking (6–7 days).
brains were blocked by making coronal cuts immediately
rostral to the optic chiasm and caudally between the cerebrum and cerebellum. tissues were frozen in 2-methyl butane, which had been cooled with dry ice according to the
protocol of rosene et al. (rosene et al. 1986). brains were
stored at –70 °c until sectioned coronally at 30 µm using a
block microtome beginning at the level of the anterior
commissure. sections were stored in 24 well plates. three
consecutive sections were placed into each well in cryoprotectant (0.05 mol/l sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.3),
30% ethylene glycol, 20% glycerol) and stored at –20 °c
until mounted. sections were assayed for npy, ob-rb, and
cart mrna by in situ hybridization histochemistry
(simmons et al. 1989).
prehybridization
all prehybridization solutions were treated with depc
and autoclaved to eliminate rnase activity. tissue sections
were removed from alternate wells and rinsed in kpbs prior

can. j. physiol. pharmacol. vol. 82, 2004

to being mounted on poly-l-lysine and gelatin coated glass
slides. this protocol generated mrna values for each assay
at increments of 120–180 µm. mounted sections were dried
for at least 2 h prior to prehybridization. slides not immediately prehybridized were sealed in boxes containing
desiccant and stored at –70 °c. tissue sections were fixed
for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated in kpbs for
10 min, and digested with proteinase k (2.5 µg/ml dissolved in 100 mmol/l tris-hcl, ph 8.0 and 50 mmol/l
edta, ph 8.0) at 37 °c for 25 min. slides were then rinsed
with sterile depc-treated water followed by triethanolamine
(tea; 100 mmol/l, ph 8.0) and acetylated for 10 min in
0.25% acetic anhydride in 100 mmol/l tea. thereafter, tissue slices were washed for 5 min in 2× standard saline citrate (2× ssc) and dehydrated in ascending concentrations
of ethanol (50%, 70%, 95%, and 100%).

s-labelled crna probe synthesis and preparation
protocols for riboprobe synthesis and hybridization of
mrna were adapted from simmons et al. (simmons et al.
1989). cdna for nucleotides 42–800 of the rat cart probe
was generously provided by dr. p.r. couceyro (chicago
medical school, chicago, ill.). this fragment was cloned
into the xbal/hindiii sites of the pbluescript ii sk(-) vector.
the plasmid was linearized with hindiii and transcribed
with t3 rna polymerase to produce the anti-sense probe.
cdna for human npy in the puc8 vector was originally
developed by carolyn worby, university of michigan, ann
arbor, mich. it was subcloned by removing an insert from
puc8 using ecori, which was then inserted into the ecori
site of bluescript ks (dr. p.d. finn, university of washington school of medicine, seattle, wash.). this plasmid was
received from dr. t. plant (university of pittsburgh, pittsburgh, pa.). linearization with hindiii and transcription
with t7 rna polymerase produced a 500 base pair antisense npy probe. cdna for rat ob-rb was generously donated by dr. j.k. elmquist (beth israel deaconess medical
center, boston mass.). this fragment was cloned into the
pgem-11 zf(+) vector (elmquist et al. 1998). linearization
with saci and transcription with sp6 rna polymerase produced a 400 base pair antisense probe. radioactive crna
copies were synthesized by incubating 250 ng of linearized
plasmid in 6 mmol/l mgcl2, 40 mmol/l tris, ph 7.9,
2 mmol/l spermidine, 10 mmol/l nacl, 100 mmol/l dtt,
0.2 mmol/l atp/gtp/ctp, 200 µci of 35s-utp (nen life
science products, inc., boston, mass.), 40 u rnasin
(promega, madison, wis.), and rna polymerase appropriate
for each probe for 90 min at 37 °c. following the transcription reaction, the dna template was removed by adding
100 µl of dnase solution (1 µl dnase, 2.5 µl of transfer
rna (trna), 10 mg/ml, 94 µl of 10 mmol/l tris,
10 mmol/l mgcl2, and 2.5 µl depc-treated h2o) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. this step was terminated by the addition of 2 µl 0.5 mol/l edta, ph 8. an
extraction was performed by centrifugation at 735 × g in
microspin g-50 columns (amersham pharmacia, biotech)
and samples were counted in a beta-counter. the probe was
diluted to 107 cpm/ml in hybridization solution (1 ml =
500 µl formamide, 60 µl 5 mol/l nacl, 10 µl 1 mol/l
tris, ph 8.0, 2 µl 0.5 mol/l edta, ph 8.0, 50 µl 50×

treated water minus volume of probe used). the probe binding demonstrated specificity by a reduced signal when the
antisense probe competed with excess unlabelled probe.
in situ hybridization histochemistry
dried prehybridized sections were spotted with 40 µl of
35
s-labelled crna probes (107 cpm/ml), coverslipped, and
incubated at 54 °c in a humidified incubator overnight.
coverslips were removed and the tissues were rinsed in 4×
ssc followed by digestion with  xxxg1963xxx  (20 µg/ml,
37 °c, 30 min) in rnase buffer (0.5 mol/l nacl,
10 mmol/l tris-hcl, 0.5 mmol/l edta). tissues were
rinsed in descending concentrations of ssc and dithiothreitol (dtt) (1.5 µg/ml; 2×, 1×, 0.5×) followed by ssc 0.1×
for 30 min at 60 °c, and dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol (50, 70, 95, 100%). after drying for at least
2 h, sections were exposed at 4 °c on biomax mr x-ray
film (eastman kodak, rochester, n.y.; ob-rb, 4 days; npy,
cart, 42 h). slides were defatted in xylene, dipped in
ntb2 nuclear emulsion (kodak, diluted 1:1 with distilled
water) and exposed for 2–4 weeks at 4 °c (ob-rb, 4 weeks,
npy, 3 weeks, cart, 2 weeks) before being developed in
d19 developer (kodak) for 3.5 min at 14–15 °c and fixed in
rapid fixer (kodak) for 5 min. thereafter, tissues were rinsed
in running distilled water for 1 h, counterstained with
thionine (0.25%), dehydrated through graded concentrations
of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with
permount (fisher scientific, fair lawn, n.j.).
cell counts and data analysis
matched sections were selected from all rats based on
morphological assessment using a light microscope at low
magnification and consulting the atlas of paxinos and watson (paxinos and watson 1986). cell counting began in the
rostral arc and continued caudally for 7 sections
(1.17 mm). cell counts were restricted to 4 fields on either
side of the third ventricle (2 × 2 grid; 400 µm lateral to the
third ventricle × 240 µm vertical to the median eminence).
cell counts were performed by an observer who was blinded
to the treatment groups. cells were visualized at 400× magnification and were considered to be positive if >9 silver
grains were clustered over a visible cell nucleus or within an
area approximating that of a typical cell. this grain density
corresponded to a signal:background ratio of approximately
3:1 (finn et al. 1998) the number of positive cells in 7 sections for each rat was summed, and an average was calculated for each treatment group.
statistics
a comparison of cell counts was performed by anova
followed by newman-keuls multiple comparison test using
graphpad prism (graphpad software inc., san diego,
calif.). a p value of <0.05 was considered significant.

results
weight loss in fasted rats ranged from 9% to 13% of baseline while the weight in the fed control group increased by
approximately 4%. weight loss was the same regardless of
leptin administration. the fasted group that was re-fed for

24 h weighed significantly more than the fasted groups, but
weighed significantly less than the fed group (fig. 1).
fasting significantly reduced the number of cartexpressing neurons in the arc of fasted animals compared
with fed controls (fig. 2; p < 0.05). this effect of fasting
was blocked by leptin treatment as the number of cart
mrna positive cells in fasted rats treated with either i.c.v.
or s.c. leptin was significantly increased compared with untreated fasted rats. cart expression in fasted rats treated
with leptin was no different from cart expression in fed
controls. a similar effect of re-feeding was observed, as the
number of cart neurons in fasted rats after 24 h of refeeding was not different from fed controls.
fasting increased the number of ob-rb mrna positive
cells in the arc approximately 2.5-fold compared with fed
controls (fig. 3). the mean number of ob-rb positive cells
in the s.c. leptin treated and re-fed groups were similar to
controls whereas an intermediate response was seen in fasted
rats treated with i.c.v. leptin. while these changes in ob-rb

expression did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10 by
anova), they are consistent with previous reports. a
larger sample size would likely achieve statistical significance.
fasting increased the mean number of npy positive cells
in the arc approximately 5-fold compared with fed controls (fig. 4; p < 0.05). neither s.c. leptin nor re-feeding affected the npy response to fasting, whereas fasting-induced
stimulation of npy was blocked by i.c.v. leptin.

discussion
our observation of increased npy and ob-rb expression
and reduced cart expression in fasted rats agrees with the
collective results of several studies (ahima et al. 1999;
baskin et al. 1998, 1999b). however, there is only 1 other
report that describes the effects of a fast on all 3 transcripts
within the same study. that study reported that fasted sheep
had increased expression of npy and obr and reduced
cart mrna, although the decrease in cart mrna failed
to reach statistical significance (adam et al. 2002). in addition, the current study is the first to report the concurrent
changes in cart, npy, and ob-rb expression with refeeding. the re-feeding results of this study add to the limited information about the recovery of appetite-regulating
neuropeptides following a fast. our data indicated that npy
expression remained elevated 24 h following the end of a
48-h fast. in contrast, ob-rb and cart mrna levels returned to non-fasted control levels within 24 h. while our
study did not address the duration of increased npy expression, the time frame is likely between 24 and 72 h, because
npy expression in the arc was reported to be normal after
3 days of re-feeding following a 48-h fast (davies and
marks 1994). it should be noted that refeeding for 24 h did
not fully restore the weight lost during the 48-h fast. our
finding that cart mrna levels recovered sooner than npy
is consistent with the observation that  xxxg1801xxx 
expression following a 24-h fast in mice returned to normal
sooner than the orexigenic peptides npy and agoutiregulated protein (swart et al. 2002).  xxxg1801xxx 
is the precursor to the anorexigenic peptide, alpha-melanocyte
stimulating hormone, and is extensively co-localized with

cart in the arc (adam et al. 2002). these results suggest
that re-feeding normalized anorexigenic inputs before
orexigenic drive is reduced. furthermore, they suggest that
the orexigenic drive after a fast (mediated by increased npy
expression) is resistant to termination by anorexigenic signals. maintenance of elevated npy following a period of caloric restriction would favor fat deposition and would confer
survival advantages.
the fasting-induced increase in npy and ob-rb expression combined with the decrease in cart mrna expression in the arc observed in this experiment were probably
the result of a reduction in leptin signaling. to determine if
reduced leptin signaling was the primary feedback signal affecting npy, cart, and ob-rb gene expression, we assessed the effect of leptin administration on these parameters
in fasting rats. s.c. administration of leptin did not prevent
the fasting-induced up-regulation of npy mrna in the
arc, whereas leptin blocked the reduction in cart
mrna. because leptin replacement did not abrogate the effect of fasting on npy, it appears that fasting-induced hypoleptinemia was not the sole or primary cause of increased
npy expression. by the same logic, the ability of leptin replacement to block the effect of fasting on cart implies
that fasting-induced hypoleptinemia was the primary cause
of decreased cart expression. the effect of leptin on
cart expression in fasted rats is consistent with the observations of ahima et al. (ahima et al. 1999), whereas failure
of leptin to normalize the npy expression in fasted rats was
at variance with the same study. two differences in experimental design are worth considering. first, leptin administration began 4 days prior to the onset of the fast in the
ahima study. in the present study, leptin was not administrated prior to the onset of fast. secondly, the leptin dose in
the ahima study was twice that used in the present study
(96 µg/day vs. 48 µg/day). although the higher replacement
dose in the ahima study maintained leptin levels at prefasting levels during the fast, it resulted in hyperleptinemia
during the 4 days prior to initiating the fast. our observation
that i.c.v. leptin, but not s.c. leptin, prevented increased npy
expression in fasted rats may suggest that the s.c. leptin dose
was inadequate to normalize leptin signaling. it is likely that

i.c.v. leptin exposed leptin receptors to higher leptin concentrations as a result of the leptin bypassing the blood brain
barrier or avoiding degradation in the periphery. re-feeding
failed to normalize npy within 24 h (present study; swart et
al. 2002; not determined in the ahima study), even though
leptin levels achieved during this 24-h period of hyperphagia
were comparable to leptin levels produced by administering
96 µg leptin/day in fasted rats (ahima et al. 1999). this observation suggested that normalization of npy expression
may require a leptin threshold with both a dose and duration
component. regardless of whether or not leptin is the primary regulator of npy, our results indicate that cart and
ob-rb were more sensitive than npy to leptin signaling because leptin replacement (regardless of route) and re-feeding
each normalized their expression.
in summary, we have shown that the number of npy and
ob-rb mrna expressing cells in the arc are increased by
fasting, whereas the number of cart mrna positive cells
is decreased. the effects of fasting on ob-rb and cart are
abrogated by either i.c.v. or s.c. leptin replacement. in addition, normalization of ob-rb and cart expression occurs
within 24 h of re-feeding. in contrast, neither s.c. leptin nor
re-feeding affects fasting-induced stimulation of npy expression. we conclude that fasting-induced changes in
cart and ob-rb gene expression are the result of reduced
leptin signaling, whereas additional mechanisms regulate
npy. elevated npy expression despite re-feeding-induced
normalization of leptin signaling may be part of the mechanism that favors reversal of a nutritional deficit.
