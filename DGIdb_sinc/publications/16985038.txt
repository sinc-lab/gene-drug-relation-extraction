abstract
childbearing and use of oral contraceptives are known to
lower the risk of ovarian cancer, and it has been suggested
that progesterone or progestin exposures play a role in
these associations. the effects of progesterone may be
mediated in part through the  xxxg1737xxx , which
exists in two functionally distinct protein isoforms, hpr-a
and hpr-b. it is known that individuals carrying the a
allele of the  xxxg1737xxx  gene (pgr) polymorphism, +331 a/g (rs10895068), have greater production of
the hpr-b receptor isoform. we therefore examined the
association between pgr +331 a/g genotype and risk of
ovarian cancer in a population-based study of 490 cases
and 534 controls in the state of connecticut. adjusted for
various reproductive and other factors, a statistically

significant increased risk was seen for carriage of the a
allele compared with gg genotype [odds ratio (or), 1.68;
95% confidence interval (95% ci), 1.09-2.59]. when subjects
were considered separately according to menopausal status,
no increased risk with the a allele was seen for premenopausal women (or, 0.96; 95% ci, 0.46-2.02) but significantly increased risk was found for postmenopausal
women (or, 2.31; 95% ci, 1.31-4.06). similar increased
risks particularly among postmenopausal women were seen
for all histologic tumor types. these findings have been
observed before for breast and endometrial cancer, although
not for ovary, but still suggest that an hpr-b mechanism
may be involved in ovarian neoplasia. (cancer epidemiol

introduction
estrogens and progesterone are the principal steroid hormones of reproduction in women, and it is established that
both childbearing and use of oral contraceptives lower the
risk of developing ovarian cancer. in reviewing the literature
on the effects of these hormones, we suggested that the
protective effects of parity and oral contraceptive use were at
least in part due to increased progesterone or progestin
exposures (1). since that time, additional studies have
supported this hypothesis (2). the effects of progesterone
are mediated through the  xxxg1737xxx , which exists
in two morphologically and functionally distinct protein
isoforms, hpr-a and hpr-b. mice with loss of pr-a and
exclusive production of pr-b have increased uterine epithelial
cell proliferation in response to estrogen alone and to estrogen
plus progesterone (3). the two  xxxg1737xxx  isoforms
are produced from the same gene by separate promoters and
by initiation of translation at distinct signals (3). biochemical
assays of the  xxxg1737xxx  gene (pgr) show that
the a allele of the promoter region polymorphic variant, +331
a/g, increases transcription of the hpr-b receptor isoform
compared with gg carriers (4). we therefore examined the
association between pgr +331 a/g genotype and risk of
ovarian cancer in a case-control study in connecticut.

materials and methods
study population. a population-based case-control study
was carried out for the study of ovarian cancer. this study was
approved by the connecticut department of public health,
the yale human investigation committee, and all 31 other
connecticut hospital institutional review boards. potentially
eligible case subjects were english-speaking women resident in
connecticut, diagnosed at 35 to 79 years of age, between
september 1, 1998 and february 28, 2003, with new primary
borderline or invasive epithelial ovarian tumors. case subjects
were identified by use of a rapid reporting system, in which
staff visited pathology departments and hospital tumor
registrars of all 32 connecticut hospitals at 2- to 4-week
intervals. records were also obtained for connecticut residents
receiving care in major cancer referral centers in adjacent
states, and the connecticut tumor registry was queried to
identify any missed cases from the hospitals information.
pathology reports were obtained for all potentially eligible
cases and reviewed by us for eligibility and histologic
classification of tumor type. for cases with diagnoses of
borderline or mucinous tumors, we procured tumor slides
and systematically reviewed them according to standardized
criteria. following physician consent, letters of introduction
were sent to cases briefly explaining the study, the voluntary
nature of participation, and noting which doctor gave approval
for contact. this was followed up by telephone calls from
the interviewer to schedule the in-person interview. at
interview, after providing informed consent, subjects were
asked the risk factor questionnaire, and then four buccal
mucosa brushings (one upper and one lower on each side of
the mouth) were taken.
a representative sample of the general population of the
study area was used for control subjects. controls under age
65 years were identified by list-based random digit dialing
methods. to improve participation, sampled telephone

numbers found to have addresses in reverse telephone
directories were mailed study introduction letters before initial
random digit dialing contact. controls 65 years of age and over
initially were randomly chosen from rosters of the residents of
connecticut obtained from the health care financing administration and later were identified by the same random digit
dialing methods as were used for the younger controls. all case
subjects had telephone numbers found within 1+ residential
blocks, which validated the sampling frame of the random digit
dialing controls. control subjects were ascertained over an
eligibility period from april 15, 1999 to september 17, 2003 in
three age strata (35-49, 50-64, and 65-79 years) to match the age
distribution of cases. potential control subjects received letters
of introduction briefly explaining the study and the voluntary
nature of participation. this was followed up by telephone
calls from the interviewer to determine eligibility and, if
eligible, to schedule the in-person interview. any potential
control who had had cancer of the ovary or who had had
bilateral oophorectomy (or oophorectomy but uncertain
whether it was total) was excluded from the study. interview
and buccal swab procedures identical to those for the cases
were used for the controls.
in total, 720 eligible cases were identified and 497 (69%)
enrolled in the study. reasons for nonparticipation included
death before study contact (12%), subject refusal (15%) or too
ill (1%), or lost to follow-up (3%). of the 497 cases, 490 (99%)
provided buccal cell samples. nine-hundred two eligible
controls were interviewed and 551 (61%) were enrolled.
thirty-three percent of eligible controls refused participation,
1% were too ill, and 5% were lost to follow-up. of the 551
interviewed, 534 (97%) gave buccal cell samples.

had dna extracted by standard phenol/chloroform methods.
genotyping was accomplished by pcr and dot blot methods.
the forward and reverse primers used for the pgr +331 a/g
polymorphism were 5¶gcactactgggatctgagatc3¶ and
5¶acgcagagtactcacaagtcc3¶, respectively. each 25 al
pcr was cycled at 97jc for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of 96jc for
30 seconds, 55jc for 30 seconds, 72jc for 40 seconds, and then
finally, 72jc for 5 minutes. the allele-specific oligonucleotide
probes for the +331 a/g variant were allele 1 (a), 5¶-agataaaagagccgc-3¶, and allele 2 (g), 5¶-agataaaggagccgc-3¶. autoradiographs of the same blot probed for different
alleles were generated to distinguish homozygous from
heterozygous alleles. subjects with no spot intensities for
either allele were rerun. three cases and one control still did
not yield results and were omitted from statistical analyses.
for quality control purposes, a 5% random sample of all
subjects was rerun and found blindly to be completely
concordant with the original results. spots were read blindly
with respect to case-control status, and both case and control
samples were included in each 96-well plate.
statistical analyses. analysis of allele status was carried
out using unconditional multivariate logistic regression methods. the glim computer program (5) was used for calculations. regression models included adjustment for the three
categories of the age matching, continuous terms for age
within each of the three age categories, years of education, race
(african-american versus other), menopausal status, number
of full-term pregnancies, years of oral contraceptive use,
average months of lactation per pregnancy, history of tubal
ligation, and history of hysterectomy (at least 5 years in the
past). two cases and no controls were homozygous aa
carriers; thus this genotype was considered together with
heterozygotes. the three genotype groups were consistent
with hardy-weinberg equilibrium among controls (p = 0.32).
all statistical tests were two sided and considered to reach
statistical significance at the 0.05 level.

results
characteristics of the study subjects are shown in table 1.
within each of the categories of age, the age matching was very
good. as has been seen in virtually all studies of ovarian
cancer, cases tended to have fewer full-term pregnancies and
to use oral contraceptives less frequently than controls.
table 2 gives the numbers of subjects and risk of ovarian
cancer according to genotype for all women and separately
for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. the increased risk seen with carriage of the a allele among all
women is due to an effect only in postmenopausal women.
most of the participants in the present study were white, for
whom carriage of the a allele had an odds ratio (or) of 1.59
[95% confidence interval (95% ci), 1.02-2.48] among all and
2.05 (95% ci, 1.16-3.63) among the postmenopausal. an
increased risk was also observed for african-american
women, but numbers of subjects were too small (3 case, 1
control carrier) to provide adequate or estimates. among
controls, there were no associations between allele carriage
and any of the reproductive factors in table 1 (data not
shown).
finally, table 3 shows the risks of ovarian cancer associated
with carriage of the a allele according to tumor histologic type.
again, no associations were seen among premenopausal
women, but for postmenopausal women, increased risk was
found for each of the histologic groups. women with
mucinous ovarian tumors had the highest risks of all of the
histologic types. the same high increased risks in postmenopausal women were found when the mucinous tumors were
subclassified as endocervical/mullerian (or, 4.67) and intestinal/enteric (or, 4.67).

discussion
germ-line genetic variation in pgr has been under study for
about a decade. initial reports suggested that the progins
allele was associated with risk of ovarian cancer; however,
subsequent studies have not been confirmatory (reviewed in
ref. 6). the functional significance of the progins variant is
not yet well defined.
in the present study, we observed statistically significantly
increased risk of ovarian cancer for carriage of the pgr +331
a/g a allele among all women and especially among
postmenopausal women and a similar picture within all tumor
histologic groups. a virtually identical pattern of increased
risk with the a allele among all women and particularly
postmenopausal ones has been observed for breast cancer in a
nested case-control sample from the nurses’ health study (7).
the breast cancer analysis involved 990 cases and 1,364
matched controls and showed statistically significant ors of
1.33 to 1.41 for carriage of the a allele. a second nested sample
of 197 cases of endometrial cancer and 397 matched controls
from the nurses’ health study also showed increased risk of
that disease (or, 1.90; 95% ci, 1.10-3.29) associated with
carriage of the a allele (4). on the other hand, an ovarian
cancer case-control study that looked at the +331 a/g variant
did not show associations with risk (8). that study involved
caucasian subjects from both north carolina and australia
and found ors below unity for the a allele for all histologic
types. given the lack of a priori reason for focusing on one
specific type and thus the multiple comparisons issue, none of

the associations reached statistical significance. a second
ovarian cancer study, in eastern massachusetts and new
hampshire, also overall did not show increased risk for the
+331 a allele, although some risk elevation was observed
for women with invasive serous or undifferentiated tumors
(or, 1.3; ref. 9). nevertheless, the two studies do not really
confirm the present results.
it has been suggested that the enhancement of pr-b
transcription by pgr +331 a increases epithelial cell proliferation in response to estrogen and estrogen + progesterone
stimulation (3) and that such constitutive up-regulation could
thus increase cancer risk of sex hormone-dependent organs.
a second functional effect of the +331 a/g variant has also
been identified. among premenopausal women in sweden,
carriers of the a allele were found to have on average >60%
higher serum prolactin levels than gg homozygotes (10).
progesterone receptors are absent from the pituitary; thus, the
influence of progesterone on prolactin release occurs in the
brain, through progesterone receptors, involving interactions
with endorphins, serotonin, or dopamine (10). the effect of
prolactin on increasing risk of ovarian cancer development is
unknown, although it has been shown that elevated serum
prolactin levels strongly predict subjects with ovarian cancer
compared with controls (11). prolactin also markedly inhibits
apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells (12). thus, possibly, the
overall effect of the pgr +331 a allele is actually not to
modulate steroid hormone-related induction of new cancers
but rather to inhibit apoptosis of existing but undetected
tumors. this is consistent with the rather general increased risk
by carriage of the a allele seen for three cancer sites and for
all ovarian cancer histologic groups and with the lack of
association with the known ovarian cancer reproductive risk
factors among controls.
this case-control study was large and had sufficient power
to detect ors of the magnitude seen. examination of germ-line
pgr variants was a specific aim of the study, and the observed
associations were in the directions expected to be found. with
response fractions of 69% for cases and 61% for controls, it is
possible that our subject sample could differ somewhat from
a completely representative one. however, our case-control
differences in parity and oral contraceptive use are identical to
those in the literature and suggest that our subject sample
reflects the population base. in addition, inclusion of all of
the adjustment variables made little change to the magnitudes
of the ors, suggesting that little confounding was present
and thus that, even if our sample were not truly representative
on these factors, the results would still be close to the true
associations.

in summary, we found that carriage of the a allele of the
pgr +331 a/g polymorphism was associated with increased
risk of ovarian cancer, particularly among postmenopausal
women. in light of the two other ovarian cancer studies that
did not observe this association but two of breast and
endometrial cancer that did, further examination of this
association may be warranted.
