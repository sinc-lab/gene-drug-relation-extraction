sorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of several kinases involved in tumour
proliferation and tumour angiogenesis including raf, vegfr and platelet
derived growth factor receptor. in vivo  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition has been
observed in pharmacodynamic studies. sorafenib is one of several vegf-targeting compounds with recently demonstrated substantial anti-tumour
effects in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. delay in time to disease progression has been demonstrated in cytokine-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and further investigation is ongoing in a wide variety of tumour types.
sorafenib is well tolerated, with common toxicities including rash, diarrhoea,
hand–foot skin reaction, fatigue and hypertension, when administered as the
standard dose of 400 mg b.i.d.

1. introduction

sorafenib is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of several kinases involved
in tumour proliferation and tumour angiogenesis including raf, vegfr and
platelet derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr). this compound has undergone
clinical testing in a variety of solid tumours. this review will describe the development of this compound, focusing on the most developed clinical data, metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (rcc).

tumour physiology relevant to sorafenib

2.1

angiogenesis

angiogenesis, the process of blood vessel formation and growth, has been recognised
as important in tumour pathophysiology and a suitable target for anti-cancer therapy. vegf is the primary mediator of both normal and tumour-associated angiogenesis through increased microvascular permeability to plasma proteins [1],
induction of endothelial cell division and migration [2,3], promotion of endothelial
cell survival through protection from apoptosis [4,5] and reversal of endothelial cell
senescence [6]. vegf exerts its biological effect through interaction with receptors
(vegf receptors 1, 2 and 3) present on the endothelial cell surface [1]. upon binding of vegf to the extracellular domain of its receptor, dimerisation and autophosphorylation of the intracellular receptor  xxxg2198xxx  occurs and a cascade of
downstream proteins are activated. another protein relevant to tumour angiogenesis
is platelet derived growth factor (pdgf). the receptor for the pdgf protein is
expressed on pericytes, smooth muscle cells and capillary endothelial cells. pdgf
exerts its biological effect through engagement of receptor on these vascular supporting cells, affecting processes relevant to tumour angiogenesis, including endothelial
cell motility and apoptosis [7].

pathway (figure 1) [8,9]. ligand engagement of the
receptor activates ras, a membrane localised protein, which in
turn activates several downstream effectors. notably, the serine/
threonine kinase raf is activated. this leads to downstream signalling through map kinase (also called mek) and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (erk). subsequent gene transcription
leads to a variety of tumour-promoting cellular effects depending
on the nature of the ligand/receptor interaction. these effects
may be on the tumour cell or surrounding cells (e.g., endothelial
cells) and thus this pathway may have multiple effects on tumour
growth and progression.
renal cell carcinoma as a target disease
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is a disease historically
unresponsive to conventional treatment strategies, with a limited subset of patients experiencing clinically meaningful
benefit from il-2 and/or  xxxg1137xxx  therapy [10]. a growing
2.3

454

understanding of the underlying molecular biology of rcc
has identified a number of pathways pertinent to the pathophysiology of the most common histological subtype of this
disease, clear cell rcc. activation of the hypoxia response
pathway by mutations of the von hippel-lindau (vhl)
tumour suppressor gene has been shown to be tightly linked
to rcc pathogenesis. inactivating mutations or methylation
in the vhl gene have been observed in the majority of sporadic clear cell rcc tumours [11-15]. resulting constitutive
activation of the hypoxia response pathway leads to the activation of a variety of genes important in tumour progression,
including vegf and pdgf. therefore, the biology underlying rcc supports the theory that agents targeting vegf and
pdgf may have an anti-tumour effect.
in regards to the  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitory activity of sorafenib,
the underlying relevant biology of rcc has not been well
characterised. ras mutations in rcc are not common [16],

expert opin. pharmacother. (2006) 7(4)

rini

although activation of the mapk pathway has been demonstrated in 50% of human rcc tumours in one series [17]. it is
likely that there are other activators of the raf oncoprotein
aside from ras mutations. the contribution of mapk
pathway to rcc pathogenesis and thus the therapeutic relevance of  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition by sorafenib in rcc requires
further investigation.

2.4 vegf-targeted therapy in metastatic renal cell
carcinoma

as noted above, several vegf-targeting agents have undergone
clinical testing in metastatic rcc, producing robust results
leading to regulatory approval and widespread use.
 xxxd328xxx  antibody (bevacizumab)
bevacizumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody
against vegf that binds to and neutralises all biologically
active isoforms of vegf [18]. a randomised, placebo-controlled
trial of bevacizumab in treatment-refractory, metastatic clear
cell rcc demonstrated a significant prolongation of time to
progression in the high dose bevacizumab arm compared with
placebo (4.8 versus 2.5 months; p < 0.001 by log rank test) [19].
the primary toxicities of this drug observed in this study were
hypertension and asymptomatic proteinuria. based on the
results noted above and availability after fda approval for metastatic colorectal cancer, bevacizumab has indeed been used offlabel in metastatic rcc. pending results from ongoing
phase iii trials, this agent may assume a significant role in the
future treatment of metastatic rcc patients.
2.5

sunitinib
sunitinib is an orally bioavailable oxindole small molecule
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor of vegfr and pdgfr [20,21]. two
phase ii trials of sunitinib administered at a dose of 50 mg/day
for the first 4 weeks of repeated 6-week cycles in cytokinerefractory, metastatic rcc have been conducted [22]. objective response rates of 40% were observed, with additional
patients experiencing tumour shrinkage. toxicity in these trials, most commonly grade 1 or 2, included fatigue/asthaenia,
nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis and cytopaenias. investigation of
sunitinib in untreated, metastatic rcc patients in a phase iii
trial versus  xxxg1137xxx  has recently completed accrual. based upon
the phase ii data and pending phase iii results, sunitinib has
received regulatory approval for rcc. this agent is likely to
gain substantial use in metastatic rcc patients given the
robust clinical effect observed.

introduction to sorafenib

3.1

chemistry

resulting in enhanced  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition. figure 2
demonstrates the chemical structure of sorafenib with a
molecular formula of c21h16cif3n4o3 × c7h8o3s and a
molecular weight of 637 g/mol. sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of several  xxxg1924xxx  isoforms including c-raf, wild-type
b-raf and mutant b-raf (v599e). table 1 lists the full spectrum of the inhibitory effects of sorafenib, including inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx  and pdgfr-b, relevant to the
rcc biology described above [23].
pre-clinical development
sorafenib has undergone evaluation in vitro in hct-116
(colon) and miapaca-2 (pancreas) cell lines [24,25]. further in
vivo evaluation was carried out in the hct-116 xenograft
model which contains a  xxxg1285xxx  mutation. sorafenib significantly inhibited tumour growth in these models in a dosedependent fashion. sorafenib has also demonstrated direct
inhibition of the map kinase pathway (as measured by erk
phosphorylation in several sorafenib-treated tumour cell lines)
in addition to  xxxg1274xxx  and -3 and pdgfr-b inhibition in
cell culture system biochemical assays [23]. xenograft models
including mda-mb-231 human mammary adenocarcinoma
and colon and non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) models
treated with daily sorafenib demonstrated significant inhibition of tumour growth and tumour microvessel density, as
measured by anti- xxxg1724xxx  immunostaining [23].
3.2

phase i trials
sorafenib has undergone evaluation in multiple simultaneous
phase i trials in refractory solid tumours [26-29]. these trials
employed standard dose escalation schemas from sorafenib
50 mg/day to 800 mg b.i.d. utilising both continuous and
interrupted dosing schedules (7 days on/7 days off, 21 days
on/7 days off and 28 days on/7 days off ). all four trials identified hand–foot skin reaction as the prominent dose-limiting
toxicity. other notable toxicities included diarrhoea, fatigue
and anorexia. clinically insignificant pancreatic enzyme elevations were also observed. all toxicities were reversible with
discontinuation of therapy, and significant haematological
toxicity was not observed. separate phase i studies of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin plus
paclitaxel, gemcitabine) have also demonstrated tolerability
with standard dose chemotherapy and sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d.
collectively, these trials identified 400 mg b.i.d. of continuously dosed sorafenib as the maximal tolerated dose to further
investigate in phase ii trials.
3.3

3.4 pharmacodynamics

sorafenib tosylate, 4-(4-(3-[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ureidolphenoxy)-n2-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide4-methylbenzenesulfonate, is an orally bioavailable bi-aryl
urea, which was identified through serial modifications of a
commercially-available  xxxg1924xxx  inhibitor, gk-00687,

assessment of the effect of sorafenib administration on raf
kinase inhibition has been undertaken. erk phosphorylation in
peripheral blood lymphocytes was measured on days 0, 2, 7 and
then weekly for 6 weeks in the continuous dosing phase i study
(figure 3) [29]. a dose of 400 mg b.i.d. was demonstrated to
produce almost complete inhibition of erk phosphorylation,
with partial inhibition demonstrated at 200 mg b.i.d.

pharmacodynamics were also investigated in a phase i/ii trial in
metastatic melanoma [30]. six patients receiving sorafenib
400 mg b.i.d. underwent tumour biopsy at baseline and after
4 weeks of therapy. immunohistochemical evaluation using
anti-phospho-erk antibodies revealed a decrease in phosphorylated-erk staining by ∼ 10 – 20% after therapy in the majority of patients, supporting in vivo  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition due to
sorafenib. small patient numbers in these trials precluded
correlation of  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition with toxicity or clinical
response. these data support that the maximum clinically tolerated dose of sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. is adequate for  xxxg1924xxx 
inhibition in the majority of patients. further investigation of
the molecular effects of sorafenib across all relevant therapeutic
targets (e.g., vegfr and pdgfr in addition to  xxxg1924xxx )
and relationship to clinical outcome is needed.
456

pharmacokinetics and metabolism
in vitro data indicates that sorafenib is metabolised by two
pathways: oxidative metabolism mediated by cytochrome
p450 (cyp) 3a4 and glucuronidation mediated by  xxxg2385xxx .
following administration of sorafenib 100 mg, 96% of the
dose is recovered: 77% in the faeces (51% of the total dose
unchanged) and 19% in the urine as glucuronidated metabolites [31]. the main metabolite of sorafenib, pyridine n-oxide,
comprising 9 – 16% of analytes at steady state, shows in vitro
potency similar to sorafenib. a limited dosing study in healthy
volunteers demonstrated that blocking cyp3a4-mediated
sorafenib metabolism (via concomitant administration of
ketoconazole, which also inhibits  xxxg2385xxx ) did not lead to
an increase in the mean auc of a single 50 mg dose of sorafenib [31]. therefore, cyp3a4 inhibitors are not predicted to
significantly affect sorafenib drug concentrations, although
further study is needed. there is no information of the effect
of cyp3a4 inducers on the metabolism of sorafenib. additional studies with cyp isoform-selective substrates indicated
that sorafenib is unlikely to alter the metabolism of substrates
of cyp2c19, cyp2d6 and cyp2c9 (including warfarin).
sorafenib drug concentrations measured in the phase i
studies identified several consistent features of sorafenib
metabolism. sorafenib pharmacokinetics are characterised by
a relatively slow absorption phase with cmax achieved 6 – 12 h
after dosing. the mean t½ is ∼ 24 – 36 h. all studies identified
considerable interpatient variability in sorafenib plasma concentrations with no clear dose dependency. figure 4 demonstrates individual auc and cmax values for patients on the
continuous sorafenib dosing phase i trial [29]. although small
numbers preclude definitive statements, there is an apparent
increase in sorafenib concentration ≤ 400 mg b.i.d., with no
further increase at higher dose levels. steady state plasma concentrations of sorafenib are achieved within 7 days. intake of
food has no appreciable impact of sorafenib metabolism, with
the exception of a high fat meal reducing sorafenib bioavailability by 29%, although the label recommendation is that sorafenib be taken without food. there is no impact of renal
function on sorafenib steady state in patients with a creatinine
clearance > 30 ml/min, and there is no data on patients with
creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min or on dialysis. sorafenib
metabolism is not altered in patients with child–pugh class a
or b hepatic impairment, and there is no data in patients with
child–pugh class c. there is no clear relationship between
plasma concentration of drug and incidence of drug-related
toxicity. the degree of interpatient variability observed may
result in less than adequate dosing in a significant subset of
patients treated at 400 mg b.i.d. thus, select ongoing trials
are evaluating dose escalation to 600 mg b.i.d. in patients
without significant toxicity after initial therapy.

this trial design treated all patients with an initial dose of
sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. for 12 weeks, then randomised
patients with tumour burden change within 25% of baseline
to placebo or continuation of sorafenib. in the randomised
cohort of 65 patients, a progression-free survival advantage
of 24 versus 6 weeks (p = 0.0087) was demonstrated in the
sorafenib arm compared with placebo, respectively. drugrelated toxicity included rash, hand–foot reaction, fatigue
and hypertension. of note, this study was originally targeted
to colon cancer and melanoma patients with a higher incidence of raf mutations. significant activity in rcc patients
prompted further enrollment of these patients and further
characterisation of sorafenib to document inhibitory activity
against vegfr and pdgfr.
a subsequent placebo-controlled, randomised trial of sorafenib in 905 cytokine-refractory, metastatic rcc patients
was conducted. this trial reported a progression-free survival (pfs) advantage in the treatment arm of 5.5 versus
2.8 months (p < 0.00001; figure 5) [33]. this pfs advantage
was demonstrated in the sorafenib arm despite a 2%
response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist)defined objective response rate. however, a substantial proportion of patients in the sorafenib arm (74% of the entire
cohort) were recorded as stable disease yet experienced
tumour shrinkage, accounting for the pfs benefit. based on
preliminary pfs data, crossover for patients assigned to

placebo was initiated in may 2005. of 452 potential
patients, 216 (48%) crossed-over to sorafenib treatment.
a pre-planned interim overall survival analysis (based on
220 events) was presented at the european congress of
clinical oncology (ecco) 2005. the median survival of
sorafenib-treated patients had not been reached and was
14.7 months for placebo-treated patients (p = 0.018). it
should be noted that the threshold for significance of
interim analysis was p < 0.0005 and the crossover may dilute
the survival benefit. further analysis is needed to confirm an
overall survival benefit to sorafenib in this setting.
5.

safety and tolerability

the phase iii evaluation of sorafenib in rcc offers the best
analysis of toxicity given the large sample size and placebo control arm [33]. grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 30%
of sorafenib-treated patients, compared with 22% for placebo.
drug-related adverse events of any grade (sorafenib-treated
patients versus placebo-treated patients) included rash (31 versus 11%), diarrhoea (30 versus 7%), hand–foot skin reaction
(26 versus 5%), fatigue (18 versus 14%) and hypertension
(8 versus < 1%). overall, this drug seems to be well tolerated
by the majority of patients at the 400 mg b.i.d. continuous
dosing. toxicity management by dose interruption and/or
dose reduction is effective in patients experiencing toxicity.

regulatory affairs

7.

in april 2004, sorafenib was granted fast track status by the
us fda and subsequently orphan drug status by the emea
(european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products)
and fda for metastatic rcc. in july 2005, the companies
completed the filing for a new drug application (nda) to the
fda for approval for sorafenib in metastatic rcc. in september 2005, bayer announced that the nda for sorafenib
had been accepted for review and granted priority review status by the fda. on 20 december 2005, the fda approved
sorafenib for the treatment of advanced rcc. this broad
label (without restriction to prior cytokine therapy) reflects
the benefit of sorafenib seen in the previously untreated
subgroup in the phase iii trial.

ongoing and future clinical development

renal cell carcinoma
sorafenib is now undergoing evaluation in a variety of rcc
disease states. the advanced renal cell carcinoma sorafenib
(arccs) study is a single arm, open label study for sorafenib-naïve patients with advanced rcc, now closed after
fda approval of sorafenib. eligibility requirements were
otherwise minimal with no restrictions on histology, brain
metastases or previous vegf-targeted therapy. therefore,
this study will provide some insight into the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in special populations such as cns metastases or non-clear cell histology. sorafenib combination
therapy will be tested in a multi-arm randomised trial of
two-drug combinations utilising sorafenib and other novel

agents including bevacizumab and  xxxd3307xxx , an mtor
inhibitor. this trial, conducted through the eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog), will evaluate pfs to select a
regimen(s) for further investigation. in addition, given that
the clinical cross-resistance of vegf-targeting agents in
rcc is unknown, sorafenib will also be investigated in rcc
patients who have failed prior sunitinib or bevacizumab.
finally, two large randomised trials will evaluate the utility
of sorafenib in the adjuvant rcc setting. an ecog-lead
intergroup trial will randomise rcc patients who are at
high risk for recurrence after nephrectomy to 1 year of treatment with placebo, sorafenib or sunitinib with a primary
end point of disease-free survival. in addition, the sorce
(a phase iii randomised, double blind controlled study
comparing sorafenib with placebo in patients with
resected primary renal cell carcinoma at high or intermediate risk of relapse) trial, lead by the medical research
council (mrc), will randomise > 1800 high-risk rcc
patients after nephrectomy to placebo therapy for 3 years,
sorafenib for 3 years or sorafenib for 1 year followed by
placebo for 2 years. this trial will test both the utility of
sorafenib in this setting and the optimal duration of use.
other malignancies
sorafenib is being investigated in a variety of solid tumours
given the potentially important role of  xxxg1924xxx  and vegf
receptor signalling in tumour pathogenesis.
7.2

melanoma
metastatic melanoma has undergone the most investigation
with sorafenib outside of rcc. a phase i study of sorafenib
in combination with  xxxd1796xxx  has demonstrated the safety
of sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. with  xxxd1796xxx  1000 mg/m2
every 3 weeks. in this trial, preliminary data indicates two partial responses and two additional patients with tumour
shrinkage. a phase i/ii trial of sorafenib in metastatic
melanoma, noted above for pharmacodynamic studies, demonstrated no grade 3 or 4 toxicity with 1 partial response and
12 attaining stable disease, with a median time-to-progession
of 4 months [30]. a phase i/ii study of sorafenib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel demonstrated safety and
partial responses in 11 of 32 patients treated for ≥ 6 weeks.
this led to initiation of an industry-sponsored international
phase iii trial of chemotherapy with or without sorafenib in
metastatic melanoma patients who had failed no more than one
prior chemotherapy regimen with a primary end point of pfs.
7.3

hepatocellular carcinoma
a phase ii study of sorafenib in 137 inoperable, previously
untreated hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) patients demonstrated 7 partial responses, a median time to progression of
5.6 months and median overall survival of 9.5 months. a
phase iii placebo-controlled trial in previously untreated hcc
patients was initiated in early 2005. phase ii trials of sorafenib
in combination with doxorubicin in hcc are also underway.

sorafenib has been evaluated in a phase ii study in previouslytreated nsclc [34]. a total of 52 patients with metastatic
nsclc and one or two prior systemic treatments received
sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. continuously until toxicity or disease
progression. median age was 61 years, and 85% of patients
had an ecog performance status of 1. in 48 evaluable
patients, tumour shrinkage was seen in 31% overall, including
4 patients with a partial response. the median time-to-progression was 14.8 weeks. drug-related toxicity included diarrhoea, hand–foot skin reaction, fatigue and nausea (40, 37, 27
and 25% of patients). based on the anti-tumour activity
observed in this study, further controlled trials are planned.
additional monotherapy and combination trials are underway in cancers of the prostate, breast, thyroid, ovary, pancreas
and haematological malignancies.

targets. substantial anti-tumour activity has been demonstrated in metastatic rcc, leading to regulatory approval.
additional clinical and translational investigation of this
compound in rcc and other malignancies will provide
insight into the full spectrum of anti-tumour effect and
methods of optimising response.

expert opinion

molecularly-targeted therapy has entered the mainstream of
cancer therapeutics. sorafenib is a model of effective targeted
therapy with robust anti-tumour effects and limited toxicity.
however, there is much to learn with regard to the precise
mechanism of anti-tumour activity, off-target effects that may
impact toxicity or response and long-term toxicity. blood and
tissue-based correlate studies should accompany the next wave
of clinical trials for further mechanistic insight. the clear antitumour effect of sorafenib in metastatic rcc and a favourable
tolerability profile will lead to use of this agent widely in the
community setting, often in untreated patients. the role of sorafenib in other tumour types has yet to be defined, although
initial results suggests anti-tumour activity and ability to be
combined with standard chemotherapy.
