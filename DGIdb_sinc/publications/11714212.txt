sepsis remains a major cause of death in hospitalized patients. despite a
massive research effort over the past 2 decades to identify innovative therapies
for sepsis, current treatment strategies consist primarily of antiinfective agents
and a variety of supportive measures.  xxxg1847xxx , an endogenous
protein that inhibits thrombosis and inflammation while promoting
fibrinolysis, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis.
recombinant human  xxxg1847xxx ,  xxxd1948xxx  (activated), when
compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind study of 1690 patients
with severe sepsis (recombinant human  xxxg1847xxx  worldwide
evaluation in severe sepsis [prowess] trial), decreased the relative risk of
death at 28 days by 19.4% (95% confidence interval 6.6–30.5%, p=0.005),
although there was a trend for more serious bleeding (3.5% vs 2.0%, p=0.06)
with its use.  xxxd1948xxx  is the first antisepsis drug found to have a
mortality benefit. it should be administered only to patients with severe
sepsis who meet the prowess study inclusion criteria and should be avoided
when risk factors for bleeding are present. ongoing research will help
determine the cost-effectiveness of  xxxd1948xxx , as well as its role in
critically ill populations not studied in the prowess trial.

conclusion

sepsis is the systemic inflammatory response to
infection.1 endogenous mediators promulgate
this systemic response, resulting in inflammatory
reactions in organs remote to the initial insult
that frequently progress to end-organ failure and
death.2 sepsis remains the most common cause
of death in the intensive care unit (icu) and has
an attributable mortality of 20–50%. 3–7 the
health care cost associated with treating the
estimated 750,000 cases of severe sepsis/year in
the united states is a staggering $17 billion.4, 5
despite a continual increase in the
sophistication of care provided in the icu, the
mortality rate attributable to sepsis has remained
relatively unchanged over the past 3 decades.3–7
although a patient with severe sepsis routinely

1390

pharmacotherapy volume 21, number 11, 2001

receives a number of supportive therapies in the
icu, including potent antiinfective agents,
aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor
support, mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis,
nutrition, and various surgical maneuvers, a
paucity of therapies that specifically target sepsis
are available.8 a number of innovative therapies
have been developed and studied in patients with
severe sepsis during the last decade, including
agents that augment host defenses (e.g.,
granulocyte  xxxg526xxx ) or inhibit
cytokines (e.g., inhibitors of tumor necrosis
factor [tnf]-a), vasoactive substances (e.g.,
nitrous oxide synthetase inhibitors), and
coagulation (e.g., antithrombin,  xxxg748xxx 
pathway inhibitor); however, none has been
shown to decrease mortality in large controlled
trials.9, 10
a major reason for this lack of observed benefit
is that each of these therapies has focused on
blocking or antagonizing a single intermediary
messenger molecule (e.g., cytokines involved in
the sepsis process) rather than reversing the
effects of the entire sepsis cascade (e.g., the
inflammatory or coagulation component). 11
another possible reason is that the inflammatory
process is often well under way before the
clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis (e.g., fever,
hypotension, tachycardia) are present and the
patient is considered a candidate for antisepsis
therapy.

characterized by inflammatory
response to the presence of
microorganisms or the invasion

by those organisms.

recent evidence highlights the important role
that the coagulation system plays in the
pathogenesis of sepsis.12 recombinant human
 xxxg1847xxx  (rh-apc), through its effects
on the coagulation, inflammatory, and
fibrinolytic systems, has been shown to decrease
mortality in patients with severe sepsis.13
sepsis and its sequelae: terminology
methodological heterogeneity in the design of
sepsis studies in the 1980s led to a joint
consensus conference between the american
college of chest physicians (accp) and the
society of critical care medicine (sccm) in
1991 that standardized the terminology of sepsis
and its sequelae and developed methodological
guidelines for the conduct of future sepsis
studies. 14 one of the most significant
recommendations of this conference was that
sepsis and its sequelae denote progressive stages
of the same disease process.
both infectious and noninfectious (e.g.,
trauma, thermal injury, pancreatitis) triggers can
initiate the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (sirs). the diagnosis of sirs should
be considered in patients who are hyperthermic
or hypothermic, tachycardic, tachypneic, and
leukocytotic or leukopenic (figure 1). sepsis
occurs when patients have two or more sirs
criteria and a proved or presumed infection.

sepsis: systemic inflammatory response to infection.
severe sepsis: sepsis associated with organ
dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension.
perfusion abnormalities may include lactic acidosis,
oliguria, and acute alterations in mental status.
septic shock: sepsis associated with severe
hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation along
with the presence of perfusion abnormalities.

sepsis may progress to severe sepsis when signs
of organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or
hypotension are present.14
to understand the progression of this disease
and the role for novel antisepsis therapies such as
rh-apc, one must examine the underlying
pathophysiology of sepsis, which is a complex
interplay between the inflammatory cascade and
the coagulation system.
inflammatory cascade
the sepsis cascade usually is initiated by an
inflammatory reaction to bacterial toxins.

1391

endotoxin released from the cell
membranes of gram-negative organisms and cell
wall fragments of gram-positive organisms is
pathogenic (figure 2).15, 16 the inflammatory
cascade is mediated by cytokines, which are
macrophage-derived, immunoregulatory peptides
that target end-organ receptors in response to
injury or infection. cytokines can be categorized
as either proinflammatory or antiinflammatory.
 xxxg2296xxx -a, interleukin (il)-1, and
il-6 are the most active proinflammatory
cytokines released.17 these cytokines promote
endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion, induce the

release of both proteases and arachadonic acid
metabolites, and activate the coagulation
cascade. 18 interleukin-6 seems to be the
principal mediator of coagulation activation.19
the subsequent release of arachadonic acid
metabolites such as thromboxane a 2 ,
prostacyclin, and  xxxd1903xxx  account for
many of the common clinical signs and

symptoms associated with sirs, including fever,
tachycardia, tachypnea, ventilation-perfusion
abnormalities, and lactic acidosis.20
simultaneously, counterregulatory, antiinflammatory cytokines such as il-10 provide a
negative feedback mechanism for this
inflammatory and coagulation reaction.21 these

compensatory antiinflammatory response
syndrome (cars) by inhibiting  xxxg2296xxx , il-6, tlymphocyte, and macrophage function, while
augmenting the actions of both acute phase
reactants and immunoglobulins. 2, 21 if an
imbalance develops between sirs and cars,
homeostasis is violated and a variety of clinical
sequelae may result.2 if sirs predominates, the
result may be septic shock and/or disseminated
intravascular coagulation. if cars predominates,
the immune system may be suppressed, leaving
the patient susceptible to life-threatening
infection. ultimately, hypoperfusion of major
organs (i.e., kidney, mesentery, brain, liver) may
occur, the end result being the multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome (mods). mortality
related to mods increases proportionally with
both the number of organs injured and the
duration of organ dysfunction.2
coagulation cascade
thrombosis is the result of an imbalance
between procoagulant and anticoagulant forces.22
the transformation of an unstable platelet plug
to a stable fibrin clot can be initiated by either
the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathway of the
coagulation cascade (figure 3). the extrinsic
pathway is activated by thromboplastin (tissue
factor) that is released by injured tissue. the
intrinsic pathway is activated through the
exposure of blood contents to either platelet
aggregates or exposed subendothelial surfaces.12
the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are initiated
simultaneously.12 after the common pathway is
activated by  xxxg741xxx , prothrombin is activated to
thrombin, facilitating the conversion of
fibrinogen to fibrin, resulting in the production
of a fibrin gel or unstable clot. fibrin is also
involved in the activation of factor xiii, which
converts the fibrin gel to a stable fibrin clot.
a number of endogenous anticoagulants
ensure that thrombus formation is limited to the
site of injury by preventing the deposition of
fibrin on the vessel wall and by interrupting the
coagulation cascade at various levels (figure 3).
 xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor blocks the
intrinsic coagulation pathway by inhibiting the
release of  xxxg748xxx , antithrombin inhibits the
common coagulation pathway by blocking the
activation of both  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin, and
 xxxg1847xxx  blocks thrombin generation
within the common pathway. the fibrinolytic
system also prevents excessive coagulation by
lysing existing stable clots into soluble fibrin

1393

fragments when plasminogen is activated to
plasmin in the presence of fibrin. activated
protein c promotes fibrinolysis through
inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.
d-dimer, a byproduct of fibrin degradation, serves
as an important marker of activation of the
coagulation system.23
interaction between coagulation system and
inflammatory response
the coagulation system and inflammatory
cascade work in concert with each other—with
one potentiating the effects of the other. 24, 25
thrombin not only plays a key role in mediating
the coagulation cascade, but also has important
inflammatory and cellular proliferative
properties. the role of thrombin in sepsis is as
follows:
procoagulation properties
• facilitates conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
• feedback activation of coagulation
anticoagulation properties
• activation of protein c
• formation of prostacyclin
proinflammatory properties
• increases endothelial cell  xxxg2049xxx 
expression
• promotes neutrophil-monocyte adhesion
• serves as a chemotaxin for leukocytes
• promotes formation of platelet activating
factor in the endothelium
cellular proliferation properties
• acts as a direct mitogen for fibroblasts
• promotes release of platelet-derived growth
factor and transforming growth factor-b
from platelets
• promotes release of platelet-derived growth
factor from endothelium.
thus, thrombin’s inflammatory effects include
promotion of neutrophil-monocyte adhesion and
neutrophil activation, serving as a chemotaxin for
leukocytes, potentiation of endothelial cell pselectin expression (necessary for leukocyte
rolling), and activation of endothelial platelet
activating factor.26
the inflammatory system also may have a
strong influence on the coagulation system. for
example, the proinflammatory cytokine  xxxg2296xxx ,
along with endotoxin, can promote coagulation,
inhibit anticoagulation, and downregulate the
fibrinolytic cascade.27–29  xxxg2296xxx -a
and endotoxin can stimulate coagulation by
increasing  xxxg748xxx  and membrane

1394

pharmacotherapy volume 21, number 11, 2001

coagulants. the inflammatory system can exert
procoagulant effects by decreasing the availability
of  xxxg2277xxx  for protein c activation,
increasing the release of a 1 -antitrypsin (an
inhibitor of apc), and decreasing endogenous
heparin production. finally, inflammation also
inhibits fibrinolysis by increasing the activation
of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. without a
mechanism to regulate this interaction,
coagulation and inflammation will continue to
potentiate each other, possibly resulting in
deposition of microthrombi in the vasculature of
end organs and the subsequent development of
mods.22
protein c pathway
the protein c pathway is one of the body’s
most important endogenous defense mechanisms
against thrombosis and is a key component of the
coagulation cascade. when activated, protein c
and its cofactor,  xxxg1850xxx , demonstrate
anticoagulant, antiinflammatory, and fibrinolytic
properties.26 the anticoagulant actions of apc
are numerous and include inhibition of
thrombin, factor v and factor viii activation,

inhibition of platelet activation, blocking
feedback activation of procoagulant factors, and
suppression of  xxxg748xxx  expression (figure
4).22, 26  xxxg1847xxx  also has important
antiinflammatory properties because it is able to
inhibit neutrophil activation and block the
release of cytokines from macrophages.30–32 the
profibrinolytic activity of apc occurs mainly
through its ability to reduce concentrations of
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a potent
inhibitor of fibrinolysis.26 both protein c and
 xxxg1850xxx  are  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins that
require calcium for interaction with membrane
receptors.
to become activated, protein c must bind to
 xxxg2277xxx  (an endothelial cell surface
protein) in conjunction with thrombin. the
amount of apc that is available is roughly
proportional to the amount of thrombin
produced.17 activation of protein c by thrombin,
through its ability to inhibit microthrombi
formation, effectively localizes the deposition of
fibrin to the site of vascular injury. in patients
with protein c deficiency, microthrombi can
deposit in smaller vessels leading to
hypoperfusion of organs and ultimately organ

damage.32 the important role that apc plays in
both the coagulation and inflammatory cascades
suggests that it is the major link between these
two systems.
role for exogenous apc
sepsis is associated with consumption of
clotting factors, which results in a disruption in
the balance between coagulation and anticoagulation forces, leading to the development of
disseminated intravascular coagulation and
ultimately mods. 25, 33, 34 increasing evidence
suggests a strong inverse relationship between
protein c activity and death related to sepsis.33–42
one study of 70 patients with severe sepsis (≥
three criteria for sirs with evidence of at least
one failing organ) found that 90% of patients had
an acquired protein c deficiency and that there
was a strong inverse relationship between protein
c activity and mortality (p<0.001).39 a second
study, in 41 patients with sepsis, by the same
authors, confirmed this association when
baseline protein c activity below the lower limit
of normal was found to be predictive of shock
(p=0.01) and all-cause mortality at 28 days
(p=0.07).38 a study of 26 patients with sepsis
demonstrated that protein c activity may
decrease on average 45% (range 20–70%) in
patients with severe sepsis and that protein c
activity will decrease even further if septic shock
should develop.42 these observations, coupled
with apc’s established role as a mediator
between the inflammatory and coagulation
cascades, suggest that the administration of
exogenous apc may be of benefit to patients
with severe sepsis.
animal models of sepsis have demonstrated the
protective effect of exogenous protein c. 43–45
administration of protein c, before the injection
of a lethal dose of escherichia coli, in a series of
baboons, prevented the coagulopathic,
hepatotoxic, and lethal effects associated with
severe infection. 43 in humans, a placebocontrolled, double-blind, phase ii trial, in
patients with severe sepsis, evaluated the dosage,
efficacy, and safety of rh-apc. 46 one hundred
thirty-one patients with severe sepsis were
randomly assigned to receive either rh-apc by
continuous infusion or placebo. patients in the
rh-apc arm were stratified to receive either lowdosage (12 or 18 µg/kg/hr) or high-dosage (24 or
30 µg/kg/hr) rh-apc therapy for either a short
(48 hrs) or long (96 hrs) infusion course.
treatment with the high-dosage, long-course rh-

1395

apc regimen, when compared with placebo, was
associated with significantly lower d-dimer and
il-6 plasma concentrations at 96 hours and a
trend for decreased 28-day all-cause mortality
(21% vs 34%; relative risk reduction 40%,
p=0.21). no difference was found for any of
these outcomes between the other three rh-apc
dosage regimens and placebo.
unwanted bleeding is a potential safety
concern with the administration of rh-apc
because of its potent anticoagulant and
profibrinolytic effects. interestingly, there was no
significant difference in the prevalence of serious
bleeding events between groups (treatment group
4.4%, placebo group 5.0%, p=0.68). 46 the
mortality benefit in the phase ii study, coupled
with the relative infrequency of bleeding events,
provided pivotal support for the completion of a
multicenter, phase iii trial to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of rh-apc in severe sepsis.
prowess trial
the recombinant human  xxxg1847xxx 
worldwide evaluation in severe sepsis
(prowess) trial is the only phase iii study that
has evaluated the efficacy and safety of rh-apc
( xxxd1948xxx  [activated]; xigris, eli lilly inc.,
indianapolis, in) in patients with severe sepsis.13
the prowess trial was a prospective,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter study involving 164 medical centers
in 16 countries. the primary study end point
was the effect of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) on
28-day, all-cause mortality. secondary end points
included a pharmacokinetic analysis of the drug,
an evaluation of the impact of  xxxd1948xxx  on
organ function, and a comprehensive safety
analysis.
to be enrolled in prowess, patients had to
have severe sepsis based on a modified version of
the accp–sccm 1992 guidelines.14 patients
were required to have a documented or suspected
infection, have at least three sirs criteria, and
have evidence of at least one acute (< 24 hrs)
organ dysfunction. specifically, the prowess
inclusion criteria were as follows:
infection:
patient was known or suspected to have
infection with at least one of the following:
• white blood cells present in a sterile site
• perforated viscus
• radiographic evidence of pneumonia plus
purulent sputum
• high risk for infection (e.g., ascending

1396

pharmacotherapy volume 21, number 11, 2001

cholangitis)
modified sirs criteria:
patient had at least three of the following four
criteria:
• temperature of 38°c or higher, or 36°c or
lower.
• heart rate of at least 90 beats/minute
(unless drug- or disease-induced alteration).
• respiratory rate of at least 20 breaths/
minute or partial pressure of oxygen
(paco 2 ) of 32 mm hg or less, or
mechanical ventilation.
• white cell count of 12 x 103/mm3 or greater,
or 4 x 103/mm3 or less, or greater than 10%
immature neutrophils.
organ or system dysfunction:
patient had at least one of the following five
criteria:
• cardiovascular: systolic blood pressure of
90 mm hg or less, or mean arterial pressure
of 70 mm hg or less for at least 1 hour,
despite adequate fluid resuscitation,
adequate intravascular volume, or use of
vasopressors.
• renal: urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour
for 1 hour despite adequate fluid resuscitation.
• respiratory: ratio of partial pressure of
oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen
(pao2:fio2) of 250 or less if other organ
dysfunction, or 200 or less if the lung was
the only dysfunctional organ.
• rhematologic: platelet count of 80 x
103/mm3 or less, or a decrease by 50% in the
preceding 3 days.
• unexplained metabolic acidosis: ph of 7.30
or less, or base deficit of at least 5 mmol/l
with lactate more than 1.5 times above the
upper limit of normal.
the investigators also chose explicit exclusion
criteria, specifically targeting those patients who
might not be evaluable (e.g., futile prognosis) or
at increased risk for experiencing drotrecogin
alfa-induced bleeding (e.g., hemorrhagic stroke,
major trauma, thrombocytopenia, and recent
thrombolytic, antiplatelet, or anticoagulant
therapy). the complete list of exclusion criteria
was as follows:
patient was pregnant or breast-feeding.
patient was younger than 18 years or weighed
more than 135 kg.
platelet count was less than 30 x 103/mm3.
patient had a known hypercoagulable
condition:
• apc resistance.

• hereditary protein c,  xxxg1850xxx , or
 xxxg2056xxx  deficiency.
• anticardiolipin or antiphospholipid
antibody.
• lupus anticoagulant.
• homocysteinemia.
• recent or highly suspected pulmonary
embolism or deep venous thrombosis
(within 3 mo).
patient had a condition that increased the risk
of bleeding:
• surgery with general or spinal anesthesia
within 12 hours.
• potential need for surgery during the
infusion.
• active postoperative bleeding.
• severe head trauma.
• intracranial surgery or stroke within 3
months.
• arteriovenous malformation, cerebral

moribund state with imminent death.
patient was positive for the human immunodeficiency virus with cd4+ count of 50/mm3
or less.

jaundice, cirrhosis, or chronic ascites.
patient had acute pancreatitis without a source
for infection.
patient had participated in another
investigational study within 30 days.
patient was receiving any of the following drugs
or regimens:
• unfractionated heparin within 8 hours
before the infusion (prophylactic heparin up
to 15,000 u/day was permitted).
•  xxxd1997xxx  within 12
hours (prophylactic doses permitted).
• warfarin within 7 days before the infusion,
and if the prothrombin time exceeded the
upper limit of normal.
•  xxxd234xxx  more than 650 mg/day
within 3 days before the study.

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) for severe sepsis kanji et al
• thrombolytic therapy within 3 days before
the study (catheter clearance doses
permitted).
• glycoprotein iib-iiia antagonists within 7
days before the study.
•  xxxg2056xxx  with dose greater than
10,000 u within 12 hours before the study.
• protein c within 24 hours of the study.
with use of a block randomization strategy,
patients were randomly assigned to receive an
infusion of either  xxxd1948xxx  (24 µg/kg/hr
for 96 hrs) or placebo.  xxxd1948xxx  therapy
was initiated no later than 24 hours after all the
study criteria were fulfilled. patients were
monitored for 28 days after the initiation of the
study drug, or until they expired. all outcomes
were analyzed by using an intention-to-treat
approach.
after the second interim analysis (1690
patients), study enrollment was suspended after a
statistically significant mortality benefit was
observed. at 28 days, 24.7% of the patients who
received  xxxd1948xxx  died compared with
30.8% of patients who received placebo (absolute
risk reduction of 6.1%, relative risk reduction of
19.4%, p=0.005). a number-needed-to-treat
analysis suggests that one life could be saved for
every 16 patients treated with  xxxd1948xxx .
at baseline, treatment and control groups were
found to be similar with respect to demographics,
severity of illness, and time from detection of
first organ dysfunction to start of the drug
infusion. approximately 75% of patients had at
least two dysfunctional organ systems at the time
of enrollment. eighty percent of patients were
admitted to the icu from home with the
diagnosis of severe sepsis.47 the lung (54%) and
abdomen (20%) were the most common sites of
infection. thirty-three percent of patients had a
suspected infection without a positive culture.
of the 67% of patients with a positive culture,
only 50% had documented bacteremia (33% of
the total population). the prevalence rates of
gram-positive and gram-negative infections were
similar between treatment and placebo groups.
baseline d -dimer concentrations (4.15–4.22
µg/ml, normal range 0–0.39 µg/ml) and serum
il-6 concentrations (484–497 pg/ml, normal
range 0.38–10.09 pg/ml) were elevated across the
study population and found to be equal between
groups. plasma d-dimer and il-6 concentrations
declined more rapidly in the drotrecogin alfatreated group and were lower than baseline
values in the first week after the start of therapy.

antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects.48, 49
plasma protein c activity was depressed (48% of
normal) in approximately 80% of patients at
baseline and increased to an average of 74% of
normal by day 4 after the start of therapy.
prothrombin time and activated partial
thromboplastin time (aptt) were also monitored
during the infusion. prothrombin time decreased
over the duration of the infusion in a similar
fashion in each group (from 18.5 to 16.1 sec in
the  xxxd1948xxx  group vs from 18.1 to 15.5
sec in the placebo group, p>0.05). after an
initial aptt increase in the  xxxd1948xxx 
group, aptt declined more rapidly and to a
greater extent in the placebo group (from 42 to
36 sec in the placebo group vs from 43 to 42 sec
in the  xxxd1948xxx -treated group, p<0.05).48, 49
the mortality benefit did not differ between
groups when patients were stratified by age,
gender, severity of illness (acute physiology and
chronic healthy evaluation [apache] ii score),
presence of various disease states (i.e.,
hypertension, liver disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, malignancy, recent trauma, or
surgery), baseline protein c activity, or baseline
antithrombin and il-6 concentrations. 50–52
although no mortality benefit was observed with
 xxxd1948xxx  when patients were stratified
according to a history of myocardial infarction,
this is likely the result of a statistical type i error
because very few patients (267 patients) had this
clinical history.50 when patients were stratified
according to the number of dysfunctioning organ
systems, no mortality benefit was observed in
those patients with only one failing organ at
enrollment. the reduction in mortality with
 xxxd1948xxx  seems to increase relative to the
number of organs that are failing. absolute risk
reductions in mortality for the patients with one,
two, three, four, and five failing organs were
1.7%, 5.3%, 8.2%, 7.9%, and 21%, respectively.
note that prowess was not powered to evaluate
these outcomes; thus, any conclusions are
speculative and require confirmation through
additional research.53
 xxxd1948xxx  has the potential, through its
anticoagulant and thrombolytic activity, to
induce bleeding complications. in the prowess
trial, over the 28-day study period, more patients
receiving  xxxd1948xxx  experienced serious
bleeding (3.5%) than did patients receiving
placebo (2.0%, p=0.06). this suggests that one
of every 67 patients treated with  xxxd1948xxx 
will experience a serious bleeding event. during
the 96-hour infusion period, the prevalence of

serious bleeding events was significantly greater
in the  xxxd1948xxx  group than in the placebo
group (2.4% vs 1.0%, p=0.024). patients at the
highest risk for bleeding complications (e.g.,
gastrointestinal ulceration, aptt > 120 sec,
international normalized ratio > 3, traumatic
injury, or platelet count < 30 x 10 3 /mm 3 )
accounted for the majority of patients who
experienced a bleeding event. four fatal bleeding
complications were observed in the drotrecogin
alfa group, with each of these events occurring
during the 96-hour infusion period. only one
patient in the placebo group experienced a fatal
bleeding complication 6 days after the infusion.
it is important to emphasize that serious bleeding
still occurred during the prowess study despite
the careful exclusion of patients with risk factors
for bleeding.
a theoretical concern is that the mortality
benefits of  xxxd1948xxx  may be associated
with a morbidity penalty. survivors of severe
sepsis may have a compromised functional status
and a subsequently prolonged icu stay. 2 a
number of functionality and morbidity
assessments were completed as part of the
prowess study. the therapeutic intervention
scoring system (tiss) score (a measure of
intensity of icu care), the sepsis-related organ
function assessment (sofa) score (a measure of
organ dysfunction), and the activities of daily
living (adl) score (a measure of functional
status) were found to be equal between survivors
in the  xxxd1948xxx  group and those in the
placebo group. in fact, the numbers of
vasopressor-free days (20.1 vs 18.8, p=0.014) and
ventilator-free days (14.3 vs 13.2, p=0.049) were
greater in the patients who received drotrecogin
alfa therapy (table 1).54

the results of the prowess trial dramatically
have changed the way many critical care
practitioners view the pathogenesis and
treatment of sepsis and mods. the important
relationship among inflammation, coagulation,
and fibrinolysis in the patient with severe sepsis
is now much more clearly defined. in
comparison to previous phase iii trials
investigating new therapies for severe sepsis, the
prowess trial is the first large, well-constructed
study to demonstrate a significant mortality
benefit.9, 55, 56
place in therapy
the absolute mortality benefit of 6.1%
(number-needed-to-treat ratio = 16) observed in
the prowess study compares favorably with
that of many other life-saving therapies. for
example, the second international study of
infarct survival (isis-2), which compared the
addition of streptokinase to aspirin in patients
with acute myocardial infarction, demonstrated
an absolute mortality benefit of 2.7% at 5 weeks,
corresponding to a number needed to treat of
37.57 it is remarkable that  xxxd1948xxx  was
able to reduce mortality, as most study patients
were severely ill (average apache ii score was
25 ± 8), required mechanical ventilation (75%),
and were in shock (71%). the results of this
study are further validated by its methodological
strengths. the prowess trial was appropriately
powered, randomized, double-blind, and placebo
controlled. study methodology was in
accordance with the accp–sccm criteria for the
conduct of sepsis studies. the baseline
characteristics and risk factors in both the
placebo and treatment groups were well matched,

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) for severe sepsis kanji et al
and more than 90% of the patients were shown to
have an acquired protein c deficiency.
the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the
prowess study were much more extensive than
those of many other randomized, controlled
trials.58–60 according to the results of this study,
 xxxd1948xxx  should be given to patients with
severe sepsis and evidence of end-organ damage
who meet the inclusion criteria used in the
prowess trial.61 the tight exclusion criteria
employed in the prowess study will likely
exclude a significant proportion of patients who
are admitted with severe sepsis to many
institutions (e.g., those with obesity, thrombocytopenia, trauma, hepatic failure, or chronic
renal failure and pediatric or immunocompromised
patients). it is unclear whether  xxxd1948xxx 
is of benefit in those patients who fall outside the
stringent definitions for severe sepsis used in the
study. the fact that plasma protein c activity
was almost universally low in the study
population, coupled with the fact that plasma
protein c activity was not considered during
study enrollment, suggests that clinicians should
not base a decision to administer  xxxd1948xxx 
on plasma protein c activity.52, 62
the potential risk for  xxxd1948xxx -related
major bleeding will be a serious concern for icu
practitioners. although the increase in major
bleeding observed in the prowess study was
not statistically significant, it is important to note
that the study criteria that excluded patients with
risk factors for bleeding were extensive.
it may be prudent to consider stratifying risk
factors for bleeding to those that are absolute
contraindications to the administration of
 xxxd1948xxx  versus those that are more
relative.63 the absolute contraindications are the
following: active internal bleeding; recent (< 3
mo) hemorrhagic stroke; recent (< 3 mo)
intracranial or intraspinal surgery or any
hospitalization for severe head trauma; massive
trauma (e.g., flail chest); epidural catheterization;
known neurologic deformity (e.g., arteriovenous
malformation, central nervous system neoplasm);
and previous or suspected sensitivity to rh-apc.
the relative contraindications are as follows:
recent (< 6 wks) gastrointestinal bleed; recent
(< 3 mo) ischemic stroke; chronic renal disease;
chronic liver disease; platelet counts less than
30,000 mm 3; known bleeding diathesis (e.g.,
hemophilia); concurrent heparin, low-molecularweight heparin, or direct thrombin inhibitor
therapy (treatment doses); recent (< 72 hrs) use
of thrombolytics; recent (< 7 days) use of

1399

glycoprotein iib-iiia inhibitors; recent (< 72 hrs)
use of  xxxd234xxx  more than 650 mg/day;
recent (< 24 hrs) use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy.
it is also important to consider that the
potential for drug-related adverse effects
increases when a drug is used outside the setting
of a controlled clinical trial, as patient screening
techniques and monitoring practices may become
less rigorous.64 should  xxxd1948xxx  receive
regulatory approval, postmarketing pharmacovigilance will become critical, particularly as it
relates to the frequency of bleeding complications.64
assessment of bleeding risk will be a challenge
for icu clinicians as nearly all patients in the
icu have at least minor risk factors for bleeding
(e.g., gastrointestinal stress ulceration,
coagulopathy, central venous access). although a
patient may not have a major risk factor for
bleeding (e.g., recent surgery), these minor risk
factors may in fact be additive.
 xxxd1948xxx  will be a pharmacoeconomic
challenge for health care institutions. its
acquisition cost is unknown at this time;
however, it will likely be expensive. an
important consideration will be the perspective
(e.g., health care system vs societal) of any
pharmacoeconomic evaluations completed with
this agent. administration of  xxxd1948xxx  to
patients with severe sepsis will likely increase
health care system costs, not only through the
acquisition cost of the drug, but also from the
increased length of hospitalization that will likely
ensue should a patient survive an episode of
severe sepsis. a recent study examining the
health economics of sepsis suggests that sepsis in
the u.s. is responsible for almost $17 billion in
hospital costs/year and that additional health care
costs for survivors of sepsis approach nearly
$40,000/patient.4
despite an acquisition cost that will likely be
substantial,  xxxd1948xxx  therapy may prove to
be cost-effective as the mortality benefit shown in
the prowess trial is large and a morbidity
penalty does not appear to result from its use. a
recent economic analysis, using hospital billing
data for 552 of the 705 u.s. patients enrolled in
the prowess study, reported no significant
increase in hospital costs between the
 xxxd1948xxx  group ($33,400 ± $28,100) and
the placebo group ($32,100 ± $26,000, p=0.7). it
is important to note that the acquisition cost of
 xxxd1948xxx  was not considered in this
analysis.65
 xxxd1948xxx  will likely have a significant

1400

pharmacotherapy volume 21, number 11, 2001

economic impact when added to the formulary of
many institutions. it will be a challenge for
administrators to accurately estimate the number
of potential candidates for  xxxd1948xxx 
therapy because there is no specific international
classification of diseases, ninth revision (icd-9)
code for severe sepsis. a recent analysis examined
this dilemma and identified a diagnosis-related
group (drg) process that health record experts
can use to identify patients with severe sepsis
admitted to their institutions. 4 this process
should allow pharmacy administrators to
estimate future  xxxd1948xxx  use.
 xxxd1948xxx  use may be optimized through
the development of institutional guidelines. 66
these guidelines should be evidence-based, be
developed through consensus with key
prescribers (e.g., intensivists, pulmonologists),
and clearly delineate who should and should not
receive this agent. institutions also may want to
consider restricting the use of  xxxd1948xxx  to
a certain prescriber, medical service, or level of
physician (e.g., attending physicians vs house
staff). a number of ethical issues may result with
the use of  xxxd1948xxx , particularly when
patient prognosis is deemed to be futile. input
from an ethics service during guideline
development may help promote discussion
around these important issues. the guideline
development process will likely be challenging
for clinicians and could lead to more questions
than answers.
it is anticipated that there will be significant
prescriber pressure to administer  xxxd1948xxx 
to patients with severe sepsis who do not meet
prowess study criteria (e.g., trauma patients
who develop severe sepsis 10 days after injury,
oncology patients with febrile neutropenia, or
patients with noninfectious sirs [e.g.,
pancreatitis]). until further prospective,
controlled clinical trials are completed, it will be
impossible to quantify the exact benefits of using
 xxxd1948xxx  in these non-prowess study
populations.
although subanalysis of the prowess data
suggests that a mortality benefit was not
observed in patients having only one organ
dysfunction, it should be noted that the study
was not adequately powered to answer this
question and thus clinicians should be careful
before excluding this subpopulation from
treatment. 53 the definitions used for organ
dysfunction may be difficult to systematically
incorporate into clinical practice. for example,
two of the five organ dysfunction criteria are

dependent on the adequacy of a fluid challenge.
the clinical subjectiveness of evaluating adequate
fluid requirements in critically ill patients may
result in disparate practices between clinicians
when determining if an adequate fluid challenge
has been administered.67 whether types of organ
failure not considered in the prowess study
(e.g., hepatic, central nervous system) can be
used to fulfill the organ failure criteria is
unknown.
several issues regarding dose and timing of
administration of  xxxd1948xxx  require further
investigation. in the prowess trial, the time
from the first sign of organ dysfunction to the
start of drug infusion was approximately 17
hours. outside the clinical study setting, when
study-related procedures like informed consent
are not required,  xxxd1948xxx  possibly can be
infused much earlier. however, whether earlier
administration will result in an additional
mortality benefit is not clear. furthermore, all
patients enrolled in this study had severe sepsis
with proved failure of at least one organ. the
role of  xxxd1948xxx  in patients with sepsis in
whom organ failure is not yet proved, but is
anticipated, has yet to be delineated. the
decision to administer a 96-hour infusion of
 xxxd1948xxx  in the prowess trial was based
on data from a previous dose-finding study. 46
this 4-day  xxxd1948xxx  infusion, however,
has been questioned as being too short as both
serum d -dimer and il-6 concentrations were
depressed in the treatment group for up to 7 days
after the start of infusion, after which they began
to trend upward toward pretreatment values.
this would suggest that the 96-hour infusion
that was studied might lead to an incomplete
resolution of the procoagulant state. an
evaluation of a longer infusion period is
warranted.
further study also needs to be directed toward
delineating the role of  xxxd1948xxx  in patients
excluded from the prowess trial, including the
children, immunosuppressed patients, and
patients with hepatic or renal failure. as the
majority of patients in the prowess trial had
community-acquired sepsis, future research in
nosocomial sepsis will help determine if this
subgroup of patients will demonstrate a similar
mortality benefit from  xxxd1948xxx . a
pharmacokinetic study is underway, evaluating
the appropriate dosage of  xxxd1948xxx  for
patients who are morbidly obese. finally,
additional prospective research is needed to help
further delineate those patients who are at

 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) for severe sepsis kanji et al
greatest risk for experiencing unwanted bleeding
effects related to  xxxd1948xxx  administration.
conclusion
the prowess trial successfully demonstrated
that rh-apc plays an important role in patients
with severe sepsis because of its multiple effects
on the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and
inflammatory systems. at this time, drotrecogin
alfa (activated) can be recommended only for
patients with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction
who do not have risk factors for bleeding, as
described in the prowess trial. this drug,
should it be approved by the u.s. food and drug
administration, will pose significant challenges
to critical care practitioners as they strive to
appropriately implement this novel treatment for
severe sepsis into clinical practice.
