abstract
 xxxd2339xxx  (imq), an activator of toll-like receptor-7 (tlr-7), induces by several routes a profound anti-viral and anti-tumor effect
in vivo. physiologically, the immune system is using perforin-containing granules of cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) towards the same
biological purpose. this functional synergism prompted our current experiments addressing the question whether imq may influence
perforin-release and/or induce perforin in ctls in vitro. in peripheral lymphocytes of healthy and diseased subjects, imq induced a
significant increase of perforin+ ctls within 12 h in all experiments performed. this effect was most pronounced in ctls of patients
suffering from atopic dermatitis, a model disorder for subnormal perforin expression: as compared to perforin+ ctls detected at time
point zero (100%), up to 270% of perforin+ ctls were induced by 2.5 ␮m/ml imq. perforin release from peripheral blood ctls after
pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulation was not influenced significantly by imq. thus, the biological activity of imq appears to exceed its previously
known functions, inasmuch as it boosts up significantly the perforin-granule system.

1. introduction
imq, a new immune response modifier of the imidazoquinoline family, exerts profound anti-viral and anti-tumor
effects in vivo (eedy, 2002). it is efficacious in inducing the elimination of virus-infected cells from lesions of
the skin and the mucous membranes such as anogenital
hpv-papillomas, mollusca contagiosa and common viral warts (edwards et al., 1998; o’mahony et al., 2001;
gollnick et al., 2001; hengge et al., 2000; weisshaar and
gollnick, 2000). in addition, actinic keratoses (hengge and
stark, 2001; cerburkovas et al., 2001), superficial basal
cell carcinomas, and even some melanoma metastases can
be treated successfully with imq (marks et al., 2001;

steinmann et al., 2000; bong et al., 2002). on the cellular
level, it is thought that imq binds and activates tlr-7
(hemmi et al., 2002) resulting in nf␬b-dependent and
-independent induction of proinflammatory cytokines such
as members of the interferon family (sauder, 2000; lowin
et al., 1995). these cytokines, in turn, stimulate migration
of antigen-presenting cells into the local lymph nodes and
recruitment of t lymphocytes to the sites of the respective disorder/lesion where they contribute decisively to its
resolution (eedy, 2002; sauder, 2000).
the system of cytoplasmic lytic granules of ctls and of
natural killer cells plays an important role in the elimination of virus infected and tumor cells (lowin et al., 1995;
yasukawa et al., 1999; van den broek et al., 1996;
matloubian et al., 1999). following activation, the cytotoxic
lymphocyte polarizes, lytic granules are redistributed towards the target cell and, subsequently, degranulate into the
intercellular cleft. the 70 kda lytic granule protein perforin
represents a key player within the killing process. after
secretion, it polymerizes to generate a pore of ∼16 nm
diameter perforating the target membrane (lowin et al.,
1995). other granule components, most notably granzymes,
use the perforin-made pores to enter the target cell and

1308

to initiate its apoptotic demise (darmon et al., 1995). the
capability of cd8+ t cells to exert perforin-granule based
cytotoxicity depends on the number of perforin expressing
cells within this subpopulation.
this potential functional synergism of the perforin-system
and imq in the anti-viral and anti-tumor response led us
to ask, if imq exerts part of its efficacy by influencing
the perforin-system of ctls. therefore, the following hypotheses were delineated: (i) imq might increase perforinexpression; (ii) imq might influence perforin-release; or (iii)
both.
in testing the first hypothesis, we now report that imq
is capable to load the perforin-system of peripheral blood
ctls. in individuals with low numbers of perforin+ cd8hi+
ctls, namely in patients with exacerbated atopic dermatitis
(ad), a model disease for subnormal amounts of perforin+
ctls (ambach et al., 2001a, 2002), the imq-effect was
found to be most pronounced.
to test the second hypothesis a newly-developed flow
cytometry-based perforin-release assay was applied which
enabled us recently to discover a significant perforin hyperreleasability in patients with exacerbated ad (ambach et al.,
2001a). in addition, the inhibitory effect of cyclosporin and
uva-light, but not uvb or methotrexate, on perforin-release
mechanisms was unraveled using this system (ambach
et al., 2001b,c, 2004). under this assay conditions, imq
was not accelerating the pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated
perforin-release. in contrast, a dose-dependent inhibitory
impact of imq was observed in a subset of experiments.
this was prominent in individuals characterized by low
numbers of perforin+ ctls.

exacerbated ad) were incubated for 30 min on plastic dishes
at 37 ◦ c to reduce the number of monocytes/macrophages.
non-adherent cells, referred to in the following as peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) were preincubated for 1.0 h
with 0.25, 2.5, 10.0 ␮m/ml imq. pbls were resuspended
in rpmi supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs)
and incubated in a final volume of 0.5 ml at 37 ◦ c for 0, 2,
6, 8 and 12 h.
2.4. imq-effect on pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated
perforin-release

mononuclear cells from heparinized peripheral blood
(pbmcs) of 11 healthy volunteers and of four patients
with exacerbated ad (medium to severe scorad, no systemic immunosuppressive treatment before blood sampling)
were isolated at 4 ◦ c using  xxxd3253xxx -lite (linaris, bettingen,
germany) density centrifugation.

the perforin-release assay was performed as described
(ambach et al., 2001a,b). briefly, 0.1–0.5 × 106 freshly isolated pbls of seven healthy donors were preincubated for 1 h
with 0.25, 2.5, 25.0 ␮m/ml and without imq in rpmi/10%
fcs. at time point zero, cells were stimulated with  xxxd2379xxx  (1 ␮g/ml) and phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma,
50 ng/ml; both from calbiochem, schwalbach, germany) in
the presence of the drug. the portion of perforin+ cd8hi+
ctls was determined after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min by immuno flow cytometrical analysis as described in the following. at the indicated time points, cells were fixed for 15 min
in ice-cold pbs, ph 7.4, containing 2% formaldehyde and
permeabilized in pbs/fcs containing 0.2% saponin. double staining was performed using mabs against perforin and
cd8, mouse igg2b immunoglobulin served as an isotype
control for the perforin-mab. after over night incubation,
cells were washed extensively in pbs/fcs/saponin. results
were obtained and analyzed in a flow cytometer (facscan,
cellquest software, becton dickinson, heidelberg, germany). lymphocytes were gated due to their characteristics
in the forward/side scatter. in pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated
cells, reduction of perforin-staining over time was used
as a measure for the release of perforin. in unstimulated cells, increase of perforin-staining over time was
used as a measure for increased perforin expression.
using the spss-software (version 10.0.7, spss inc.,
chicago, usa) a two-tailed mann–whitney u-test, a
kolmogorov–smirnov test, and a two-tailed student t-test
assuming unequal variances were applied for statistical analysis where applicable. the level of significance was set to
p < 0.05.

of monocytes/macrophages by plastic adherence. more than
90% of monocytes/macrophages were eliminated as monitored in the flow cytometer (data not shown). the remaining
cells were incubated in rpmi/fcs ± imq without further
stimulation.
in this experimental setting, incubation of cells from
healthy donors with imq resulted in a maximal increase
∆max imq abs 1 of the perforin+ portion of cd8hi+ ctls of
8 ± 3%. to compare the efficacy of imq to induce perforin in different individuals, the maximal relative increase
∆max imq rel 2 was calculated. in cd8hi+ ctls of healthy
volunteers, imq increased ∆max imq rel as an average up to
122 ± 9%.
speculating that an imq-effect on perforin-containing
ctls might be more pronounced in ctls not fully loaded
with perforin, we additionally investigated pbmcs from patients with exacerbated ad as a well characterized model
disease for reduced levels of perforin+ ctls (ambach et al.,
2001a). in these patients, imq raised the absolute percentage of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls (∆max imq abs ) as an average
by 10 ± 5%. imq treatment resulted in an relative perforin
increase ∆max imq rel of 225 ± 48%.
in fig. 2a, a representative example of the imq effect
on perforin+ ctls is given. in fig. 2b and c, accumulated data for ∆max imq abs and for ∆max imq rel , respectively,
are shown. this effect was statistically significant when
comparing absolute values (∆max imq abs , mann–whitney
u-test: p = 0.003; kolmogorov–smirnov test: p = 0.01,
t-test: p = 0.02), as well as relative values (∆max imq rel ,
mann–whitney u-test: p = 0.01, t-test: p = 0.04).
the response of perforin containing cells to a certain
imq dose varied between individuals. a concentration of
2.5 ␮m/ml imq was most effective in five of eight experiments. three individuals responded maximally within 2 h,
in three individuals the maximal imq-induced effect was
seen after 12 h of incubation. an individual example of
perforin-staining among cd8hi+ ctls as induced by imq
over time is depicted in fig. 2d. a similar response pattern
was evoked by imq in five individuals. in addition, a slow
response starting to raise at 8 h was detected. individual time
courses of four healthy individuals and four ad-patients are
given in fig. 2e.
taken the results in cd8hi+ ctls of healthy individuals and ad-patients together, imq-treatment induced an increase of the perforin+ portion of cd8hi+ ctls in eight of
eight independent experiments.
in another series of experiments, we tested the hypothesis
that imq may influence the release of perforin-containing
lytic granules from cd8hi+ ctls. towards this end,
pbmcs of seven healthy individuals (not included in the

first part of the study) were preincubated with imq at different concentrations and stimulated with pma/ xxxd2379xxx 
at time point zero. reduction of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls
over time was assessed as a measure for perforin-granule
release. to exclude that experimental conditions resulted in
a selective loss of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls, the portion of
cd8hi+ ctls among all lymphocytes was monitored. this
parameter did not differ significantly after 120 min between

pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated and unstimulated samples (data
not shown).
no significant acceleration of  xxxd2379xxx /pma-stimulated
perforin-release was observed in this cohort of healthy individuals. in contrast, each concentration of imq showed
a trend to inhibit the release of perforin from cd8hi+
lymphocytes. this was observed in four of seven experiments and did reach statistical significance as compared

to imq-untreated pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated cells in the
total of individuals but only with 0.25 ␮m/ml imq after 120 min (fig. 3a, student t-test, p < 0.05). applying
the mann–whitney u-test, no statistical significance was
observed.
an experiment demonstrating a clear cut and dose-dependent inhibition of pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated perforinrelease is depicted in fig. 3b.
the inhibitory imq-effect upon pma/ xxxd2379xxx -stimulated perforin release was not enhanced by a longer imqpreincubation time of 3 h (n = 3, data not shown).
thus, our data of the perforin-release assay do not favor
the hypothesis that imq may interfere strongly with the
release of perforin-containing lytic granules from cd8hi+
ctls.

4. discussion
the biological activity of imq appears to exceed its previously known functions, inasmuch as it is capable to boost
significantly the perforin granule sytem of ctls, thereby
strengthening this major anti-viral and anti-tumor immune
defense mechanism as demonstrated in this study. the perforin inducing effect of imq was a surprising observation
not discernible from previously published reports. yet it was
speculated before that the locally imq-modulated cytokine
milieu biases towards a ttype1 cell mediated immune response which may result in the generation of cytotoxic effector cells (stanley, 2002). however, whereas the effect of
imq on macrophages/antigen presenting cells is well documented (hemmi et al., 2002; gibson et al., 2002), and
the imq-effect on t helper lymphocytes in vitro was documented recently (wagner et al., 1999), its activity towards
ctls, namely on the perforin-containing lytic granule system of cd8+ ctls, was hitherto unknown.
we now demonstrate that imq is capable to raise the
portion of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls in all experiments performed. in ad-patients, the imq-induced relative increase
∆max imq rel was significantly higher as compared to healthy
individuals (225 ± 48% and 122 ± 9%, respectively). low
basal levels of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls in ad-patients, as
reported before (ambach et al., 2001a, 2002), contributed
to this effect (perforin+ cd8hi+ 0 min ad: 8 ± 4%, healthy
control: 39 ± 14%). the imq-induced portion ∆max imq abs
of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls was of the same magnitude in
ad-patients and healthy individuals (ad: 10 ± 5%, healthy
control: 8 ± 3%). thus, under these experimental conditions
ad-ctls seem to be as capable as their healthy counterparts to produce perforin. therefore, it could be deduced
that perforin reduction in ad-ctls may not to be caused
by a general incapability for perforin production.
an individual heterogeneity could be measured with respect to the imq-dose necessary to achieve the maximal
effect and with regard to the time needed to reach this maximum. however, the majority of individuals (five of eight)

showed a maximal imq-effect with 2.5 ␮m/ml and peaked
within 2 or 12 h. this is, at least to a certain extent, reminiscent of the in vivo situation where an individual response
pattern to imq is well known to clinicians.
testing the second hypothesis, namely that imq may influence perforin-release mechanisms, our data showed that
velocity of degranulation in cd8hi+ ctls of healthy individuals is not enhanced by imq. in contrast, the decrease
of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls following pma/ionomycinstimulation was retarded slightly by imq. applying a
student t-test, in one constellation (i.e. 0.25 ␮m/ml imq,
120 min) a weak statistical trend towards significance was
observed. in a larger group of individuals to be studied this
trend has to be confirmed. the inhibitory imq-effect was
not observable in three of seven individuals. this was similar to the rate of individuals not responding within 2 h to
imq in experiments with unstimulated cells (three of eight,
fig. 2e). imq-induced retardation of perforin release was
most obvious in one individual with unusual low numbers
of perforin+ cd8hi+ ctls (fig. 3b).
both experimental series together suggest that imq is
able to increase perforin expression significantly in cd8hi+
ctls. thus, imq-inhibition on perforin-granule release
may be caused by induction of perforin expression although
a direct interference with signaling mechanisms governing
degranulation can not be excluded.
the imq-effect described might be mediated indirectly
by induction of ifn-␣ family members in tlr-7 expressing
cells (edwards et al., 1998; hemmi et al., 2002; zarember
and godowski, 2002; hornung et al., 2002). activating the
ifn-␣-receptor induced stat signaling cascade in ctls
was shown to activate the perforin promoter in vitro (yu
et al., 1999). in vivo, we recently demonstrated that ifn-␣
high-dose therapy in melanoma patients results as well in
a significant boosting of the perforin system in cd8hi+
ctls (ambach et al., 2003). interestingly, the positive
imq-effect was not diminished by the reduction of the
mononcyte/macrophage population (data not shown). however, tlr-7 expressing cells like b cells and cd4+ t cells
(zarember and godowski, 2002; hornung et al., 2002), the
latter recently shown to be shifted to ifn-production by imidazoquiolines (brugnolo et al., 2003), and a small fraction
of monocytes/macrophages are still present in our experimental setting. thus, the amount of cytokines induced by
imq might still be enough to induce the boosting of the
perforin system.
in addition, although cd8hi+ ctls were reported to express very low levels of tlr-7 in the peripheral blood
(zarember and godowski, 2002) and was not found by others (hornung et al., 2002), tlr-7 expression is probably
enhanced in situ by the inflammatory milieu: it was shown
to be upregulated by cytokines like ifn-␣ or interleukin-6
or by microbial products from staphylococcus aureus or
escherichia coli (zarember and godowski, 2002). therefore, a direct effect of imq on tlr-7 positive ctls in situ
can be postulated. imq ↔ tlr-7 interaction was shown

a. ambach et al. / molecular immunology 40 (2004) 1307–1314

to induce nf␬b translocation into the nucleus (megyeri
et al., 1995) which via the nf␬b binding site reported
in the promotor (zhou et al., 2002) may initiate perforin
expression.
in the inflammatory infiltrate provoked by imq in vivo,
a mixed population of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and
macrophages/antigen presenting cells is well known (arany
et al., 1999). therefore, a synergistic action of direct and
indirect mechanisms in vivo to increase perforin expression
is likely, but has to be proven in the future.
in a pathophysiological context, tlrs mediate recognition of conserved microbial structures e.g. lps or cpg
motifs of microbial dna. this results in activation of innate immunity which, subsequently, triggers the adaptive
immune response (gordon, 2002). although the natural ligand for tlr-7 is not known yet, boosting the cytotoxic
armament of ctls, namely their perforin+ lytic granule system which contains antimicrobial activity against e.g. s. aureus (berthou et al., 1997) or various intracellular infections
(ochoa et al., 2001) will help to clear microbial infection
faster.
imq seems to utilize and to focus successfully mechanisms orchestrated by tlr-7 in vivo. increasing the number
of perforin+ ctls may play an important role especially in
atopic patients known for their increased susceptibility to
viral infections of the skin (leung, 1999) and for their low
numbers of perforin+ ctls (ambach et al., 2001a, 2002).
in addition, in tumor infiltrating ctls where perforin
expression for unknown reasons rarely can be detected,
strengthening the perforin-based defense mechanisms seems
useful. thus, taken together, our data suggest that the
perforin-containing lytic granule-system may mediate in
part the anti-viral and anti-tumor efficacy of imq in vivo.
