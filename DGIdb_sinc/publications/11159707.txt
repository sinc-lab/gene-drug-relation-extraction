1 the eect of endogenous glucocorticoid hormones on the expression of rat b1 receptors was
examined by means of molecular and pharmacological functional approaches.
2 rats were adrenalectomized ( xxxg779xxx ), and 7 days after this procedure the intradermal injection of
b1 receptor agonist des-arg9-bk produced a signi®cant increase in the paw volume, while only a
weak eect was observed in sham-operated animals. a similar increase in the contractile responses
mediated by b1 agonist des-arg9-bk was also observed in the rat portal vein in vitro.
3 chemical  xxxg779xxx  performed with  xxxd2656xxx  (a drug that reduces corticosteroid synthesis) produced
essentially the same up-regulation of b1 receptors as that observed in  xxxg779xxx  rats.
4 the modulation of b1 receptor expression was evaluated by ribonuclease protection assay,
employing mrna obtained from the lungs and paw of  xxxg779xxx  rats.
5 additionally, both paw oedema and contraction of portal vein mediated by b1 agonist des-arg9bk in  xxxg779xxx  rats, were markedly inhibited by treatment with dexamethasone, or cox-2 inhibitor
meloxican, or with the  xxxg1559xxx  inhibitor pdtc. interestingly, the same degree of inhibition was
achieved when the animals were treated with a combination of submaximal doses of dexamethasone
and pdtc.
6 the involvement of  xxxg1559xxx  pathway was further con®rmed by mobility shift assay using nuclear
extracts from lung, paw and heart of  xxxg779xxx  rats. it was also con®rmed that the treatment of  xxxg779xxx 
rats with dexamethasone, pdtc or dexamethasone plus pdtc completely inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation
caused by absence of endogenous glucucorticoid.
7 together, the results of the present study provide, for the ®rst time, molecular and
pharmacological evidence showing that b1 kinin receptor expression can be regulated through
endogenous glucocorticoids by a mechanism dependent on  xxxg1559xxx  pathway. clinical signi®cance of
the present ®ndings stem from evidence showing the importance of b1 kinin receptors in the
mediation of in¯ammatory and pain related responses.

introduction
bradykinin (bk) and related kinins form a group of potent
peptides widely accepted as mediators of in¯ammatory and
nociceptive processes (farmer & burch, 1992; hall, 1992).
kinins are metabolized by proteolytic enzymes to form a
variety of products including the active fragments, des-arg9bk and des-arg10-kallidin (regoli & barabeâ, 1980). the
current classi®cation of kinin receptors distinguishes two
types, namely b1 and b2, and their existence has been
supported by both pharmacological and molecular biological

studies (for reviews see marceau et al., 1998; marceau &
bachvarov, 1998). cloning studies carried out on dierent
animal species (such as mouse, rat, rabbit and human)
revealed that kinin receptors belong to the superfamily of
seven transmembrane domain g-protein coupled receptors
(mceachern et al., 1991; eggerix et al., 1992; hess et al.,
1992; 1994; pesquero et al., 1996; ni et al., 1998a).
the b2 receptors, which are optimally stimulated by bk or
kallidin, mediate most in vivo eects usually assigned to
kinins in normal rodents, rabbits and humans, including
vasodilatation, pain, increased vascular permeability and
increased production of eicosanoids and  xxxd2738xxx  (hall,
1992; calixto et al., 2000). on the other hand, the b1
receptors are preferentially activated by kinin metabolites

des-arg9-bk and des-arg10-kallidin. with some exceptions,
these receptors are not present in most normal tissues, but
are rapidly induced under many in¯ammatory conditions
such as trauma, arthritis, cystitis, uv irradiation, colitis and
hyperalgesia (regoli et al., 1981; bouthillier et al., 1987;
marceau et al., 1987). the mechanisms that underlie the
inducible property of b1 receptors, an unusual feature for a
 xxxg89xxx , are not yet completely understood. there is now evidence suggesting that the rapid
induction of the b1 receptor gene is regulated both at the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (marceau et al.,
1997). the promoter region of the human b1 receptor bears
the characteristics of an eukariotic inducible promoter with a
functional tata box, and contains additional positive and
negative control elements, with evidence of tissue speci®city
and cytokine regulatory control (marceau et al., 1998). both
dna sequencing and analysis of the promoter region have
revealed several potential regulatory sites in the noncoding
parts of the b1 receptor gene. successive deletions indicated
that the 0.14-kb 5'¯anking fragment is sucient for
transcriptional activity and inducibility by interleukin-1b
(il-1b),  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ) and lps, and for
suppression by dexamethasone and by the putative antioxidant inhibitor of nuclear factor-kb ( xxxg1559xxx ) pdtc (ni et
al., 1998b). yang et al. (1998) have shown that ap-1
transcription factor and another unknown nuclear factors
are probably crucial for full enhancer activity. larriveâe et al.
(1998) have reported an important role of cell injurycontrolled mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, singularly the p38 pathway, in the induction of b1 kinin receptors.
it has already been demonstrated (campos et al., 1999;
medeiros et al., 2000) that activation of protein kinases such
as pkc,  xxxg2198xxx  or map-kinases, and the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx , has a critical role in vivo in modulating
the up-regulation of des-arg9-bk-induced paw oedema in
rats treated with the pro-in¯ammatory cytokines il-1b or
 xxxg2296xxx  or in isolated rabbit aorta.
considering that glucocorticoids inhibit the action of
transcription factors (for review see barnes & karin, 1997)
and that  xxxg1559xxx  is directly involved in transcription and
regulation of many in¯ammatory mediators which depend on
de novo synthesis of active molecules or, of their pharmacological receptors, the present study was designed to
investigate, by use of molecular and in vivo and in vitro
pharmacological functional studies, whether endogenous
glucocorticoids can modulate the expression of b1 receptor
in the rat. we have also assessed the role played by  xxxg1559xxx 
pathway in the b1 receptor expression in adrenalectomized
( xxxg779xxx ) animals.

methods
adrenalectomy
experiments were conducted using non-fasted male wistar
rats (140 ± 180 g) housed at 22+28c, under 12 : 12 h lightdark cycle (lights on at 0600 h). in most experiments, the
animals were  xxxg779xxx  according to the procedures described by
flower et al. (1986) with minor modi®cations. for this
purpose, rats were anaesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol
(0.25 g kg71, i.p.), the dorsal region was incised (approxibritish journal of pharmacology vol 132 (2)

glucocorticoids and b1 receptor expression

mately 2 cm) and both adrenal glands were removed. after
surgery, animals were returned to their cages, with free access
to food. to maintain physiological sodium plasma concentrations, water was substituted by 0.9% nacl solution. the
experiments were performed 1 ± 7 days after surgery. other
groups of animals were submitted to the procedure described
above, but the adrenal glands were preserved (sham-operated,
so). the corticosterone levels in  xxxg779xxx  and so rats were
measured by radioimmunoassay (coat-a-count rat corticosterone kit, dpc, los angeles, ca, u.s.a.) in accordance to
manufacture's description.
other groups of animals were treated with  xxxd2656xxx  (2,2bis [2-chlorphenyl-4-chlorophenyl]-1,1-dichloroethane; o'p'ddd) (1.6 g kg71, p.o., once a day for 10 days), an
adrenocorticolytic agent, in order to compare the eects of
chemical cessation of glucocorticoid production with surgical
adrenalectomy procedure on responses mediated by activation of b1 receptors. the doses of  xxxd2656xxx  were chosen
based on preliminary experiments.
the reported experiments were carried out in accordance
with current guidelines for the care of laboratory animals and
ethical guidelines for investigations of experiments in
conscious animals (zimmerman, 1993).

rat paw oedema
under slight anaesthesia with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol
(0.125 g kg71, i.p.), animals received a 0.1 ml intraplantar
injection of phosphate-buered saline (pbs; composition,
mmol/l: nacl 137, kcl 2.7 and phosphate buer 10)
containing the b1 des-arg9-bk (10 ± 100 nmol paw71) or
the b2 tyrosine8-bk (0.3 ± 10 nmol paw71) selective receptor
agonists in the right hindpaw. the left paw received the same
volume of pbs (0.1 ml) and was used as control. in most
experiments, the animals were treated with captopril
(5 mg kg71, s.c.) 1 h beforehand, in order to prevent the
degradation of peptides. the oedema was measured by use of
a plethysmometer (ugo basile, italy) at several time-points
(10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min) after injection of kinins, and was
expressed in millilitres as the dierence between right and left
paws.

rat portal vein
male wistar rats (140 ± 180 g) were sacri®ced with an
overdose of co2 followed by cervical dislocation and the
portal vein was isolated, as described by campos & calixto
(1994). a ®ne cannula (pe 50) was inserted into the vessel
to aid removal of adhering tissues and fat. rings 2 ± 3 mm
long (one per animal) were set up in 5 ml organ bath
chambers containing krebs-henseleit solution (composition,
mm: nacl 118.0, kcl 4.4,  xxxd2534xxx  1.1, cacl2 2.5, nahco3
25.0, kh2po4 1.2 and glucose 11.0), maintained at 378c,
ph 7.4, gassed with 95% o2 and 5% co2. isometric
tension changes were recorded by means of an f-60 force
transducer (letica), under a basal tension of 0.5 g.
preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min before
drug additions, during which the bath solution was changed
every 20 min. following the equilibration period, in order
to con®rm the viability of the tissues, preparations were
exposed to high potassium concentration (kcl, 80 mm,
prepared by equimolar substitution of 74.4 mm of nacl by

d.a. cabrini et al

kcl in the medium) as a standard stimulus. experiments
were initiated at least 30 min after washout and replacement with normal medium. although each animal only
yielded one portal vein ring, usually six preparations were
tested simultaneously. the contractile responses are expressed in grams of tension.

influence of treatment of  xxxg779xxx  rats with some different
groups of drugs
in a separate series of experiments, in order to con®rm the
involvement of b1 receptors in des-arg9-bk-induced rat paw
oedema, animals received an i.d. injection of the b1 selective
agonist des-arg9-bk (50 nmol paw71) co-injected with the
selective b1 receptor antagonist des-arg9-npc 17731
(30 nmol paw71) or  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  antagonist hoe 140 (10 nmol
paw71). to assess the participation of cox in paw oedema
mediated by b1 agonist in  xxxg779xxx  rats, the animals were pretreated with indomethacin (2 mg kg71, i.p., 30 min) or with
 xxxd2561xxx  (3 mg kg71, i.p., 30 min) and the oedematogenic
responses were measured as described above.
in another series of experiments, the  xxxg779xxx  animals were
treated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg71,
s.c.) or with the  xxxg1559xxx  inhibitor pdct (100 mg kg71, i.p.)
once a day for 6 consecutive days after surgery. other  xxxg779xxx 
animals received dexamethasone (0.05 mg kg71, s.c.) in
combination with pdtc (10 mg kg71, i.p.) (at doses that
these inhibitors did not produce any eect alone) every 24 h
for 6 consecutive days. the eects of these treatments were
evaluated on the seventh day in both rat paw oedema and the
isolated rat portal vein models, as described previously.

gel mobility shift analysis of nuclear extracts binding to
 xxxg1559xxx  consensus oligonucleotide
lung tissues were obtained from rats treated with lipopolysaccharide of escherichia coli (lps, 5 mg kg71, i.p., 60 min)
and used as a positive control group (liu et al., 1997). lung,
paw and heart tissues were obtained from so or  xxxg779xxx  rats
and from  xxxg779xxx  rats treated or not with pdtc, dexamethasone or with a combination of both drugs. tissues were
frozen and pulverized under liquid nitrogen, and nuclear
extracts were prepared as described by shames et al. (1998).
tissues were ®rstly suspended in 30 volumes of ice-cold buer
solution a (10 mmol l71 hepes ph 7.9, 10 mmol l71 kcl,
0.1 mmol l71 edta, 0.35 mol l71 sucrose, 0.5% np-40,
0.5 mmol l71 dtt, 0.5 mmol l71 phenylmethylsulphonyl¯uoride-pmsf) and were then homogenized in polytron for
20 s twice. the homogenate was centrifuged at 15006g for
25 min. the pellet was re-suspended and homogenized in
15 ml of solution b (10 mmol l71 hepes ph 7.9,
10 mmol l71 kcl, 0.1 mmol l71 edta, 0.7 mol l71 sucrose)
and the homogenate was again centrifuged at 15006g for
30 min. the pellet was washed in a buer containing
10 mmol l71 hepes ph 7.9, 10 mmol l71 kcl and
0.1 mmol l71 edta. after centrifugation at 15006g for
30 min, the pellet was re-suspended in high salt extraction
buer (100 ml) (20 mmol l71 hepes ph 7.9, 1.5 mmol l71
mgcl2, 0.42 mol l71 nacl, 0.2 mmol l71 edta, 25%
glycerol, 0.5 mmol l71 dtt, 0.5 mmol l71 pmsf) and
incubated at 48c for 20 min. the nuclear extract was
centrifuged for a further 30 min at 15006g. the supermatant

was re-suspended in solution containing 20 mmol l71 hepes
ph 7.9, 50 mmol l71 kcl, 0.2 mmol l71 edta, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mmol l71 dtt, 0.5 mmol l71 pmsf and stored at
7708c until use. protein concentration was determined by
using the biorad protein assay kit (biorad).
electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by use
of the gel shift assay system kit from promega, according
to the manufacturer's instructions. brie¯y,  xxxg1559xxx  doublestranded consensus oligonucleotide probe (5'-agttgaggggactttcccaggc-3') was end-labelled with
[g32p]-atp (dupont, new england) in the presence of t4
polynucleotide kinase for 10 min at 378c. unincorporated
nucleotides were removed by passing the reaction mixture
over a sephadex g-25 spin column (pharmacia). in a total
volume of 20 ml, nuclear extracts (lung 20 mg, heart 30 mg or
paw 10 mg) were incubated with gel shift binding buer (mm:
tris-hcl ph 7.5 10, mgcl2 1, nacl 50, dtt 0.5, edta 0.5,
4% glycerol, and 1 mg of poly(didc)) for 20 min at room
temperature. further, each sample was incubated for 30 min
at room temperature with 25,000 c.p.m. of 32p-labelled nfkb consensus oligonucleotide. protein-dna complexes were
resolved by non-denaturing 6% acrilamide:bisacrilamide
(37.5 : 1) in 0.256tris-borate/edta (tbe) buer at 150 v
for 2 h. the gel was vacuum-dried and analysed using a
fujix bas 2000 (duèsseldorf, germany) phosphor-imager
system. for competition studies,  xxxg1559xxx  or  xxxg2251xxx  (5'gcagagcatataaggtgaggtagga-3')
unlabelled
double-stranded oligonucleotide was included in molar excess
over the amount of radiolabelled probe in order to detect
speci®c and non-speci®c dna/protein interactions, respectively.

b1 ribonuclease protection assay (rpa)
the expression of b1 receptor in lung obtained from so or
 xxxg779xxx  rats was checked by the rpa using 50 mg of total
rna extracted from tissues (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 days after
surgery). the b1 receptor probe was obtained by cloning a
pcr fragment generated using the primers 5-'cagccctctaaccgaagcctgc-3' (sense); 5'-acaccagatcggaagccgcc-3' (anti-sense) based on published rat
bradykinin b1 receptor gene sequence (genbank af009899)
and rat genomic dna as template. the pcr fragment was
cloned into the plasmid pgem-teasy (promega) and linearized
by digestion with spel. total length of the antisense probe
was 321-nt and 259-nt before and after  xxxg1963xxx /t1
digestion, respectively. a b-actin probe of 170 bp (undigested) and 150 bp (after  xxxg1963xxx /t1 digestion) was used as
an internal control. rnase protection assay was performed
with an ambion rpa iii kit (itc biotechnology gmbh,
austin, tx, u.s.a.) according to the manufacturer's
description. radioactively labelled speci®c antisense rna
probes were prepared by use of 32p-a-utp, transcribed with
t7 rna polymerase (boehringer mannheim, mannheim,
germany) and approximately 80,000 c.p.m. of each probe
was hybridized with the rna samples. the hybridized
fragments were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing
gel and analysed using fujix bas 2000 (duèsseldorf,
germany) phosphor-imager system. quantitative analysis
was performed by measurement of the intensity of the b1
receptor band normalized by the intensity of the b-actin
band.

statistical analysis
the results are presented as the mean accompanied by the
s.e.mean. statistical comparison of the data was carried out
by the use of analysis of variance followed by unpaired
student's t-test. p-values of less than 0.05 were considered
signi®cant.

drugs and reagents
the drugs used were: des-arg9-bk, bk, tyrosine8-bk,
captopril, dexamethasone, 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, indomethacin, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (pdtc), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps, e. coli serotype 0111b4, l=2630) (all from
sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, u.s.a.). des-arg9-npc

oedema formation in naive animals (0.07+0.02 ml). on the
other hand, the b2 selective agonist tyrosine8-bk (0.3 ±
10 nmol paw71) produced a marked and dose-related oedema
(ed50 1.1 nmol paw71, emax 0.38+0.03 ml, n=6) (results not
shown). however, in  xxxg779xxx  rats, 7 days prior (but not 3 ± 5
days prior), the i.d. injection of des-arg9-bk produced a
signi®cant and dose-related oedema formation (ed50 31 nmol
paw71 emax 0.51+0,045 ml) when compared to so rats (emax
of 0.18+0.01 ml) (figure 1a,c). on the other hand, the rat

(p50.001) when compared with normal rats (148.2+4.6

as demonstrated by campos & calixto (1994), the

de novo formation of b1 receptors. in portal vein isolated
from  xxxg779xxx  rats 7 days prior, at 1 : 30 h of equilibration
period, des-arg9-bk (1 ± 3000 nm) elicited a concentrationdependent contraction (ec50 of 35 nm and emax
0.52+0.03 g) when compared to so animals (ec50 of
180 nm and emax 0.38+0.02 g) (figure 1b). the treatment
of normal rats with  xxxd2656xxx  (1 ± 16 g day71, p.o, for 10 days,
a drug that reduces corticosteroid synthesis mainly by a
cytotoxic action on the cells) resulted in a marked increase in
the paw oedema (emax 0.51+0.06 ml) and a potentiation of
the portal vein-contraction induced by des-arg9-bk (ec50 of
42 nm and emax 0.63+0.05 g), similar to that observed in
 xxxg779xxx  rats (figure 2a,b). the co-injection of the selective b1
receptor antagonist des-arg9-npc 17731 (30 nmol paw71)
produced a signi®cant inhibition of the paw oedema
(87+4%) induced by des-arg9-bk (50 nmol paw71) in
 xxxg779xxx  rats. in contrast, des-arg9-bk-induced oedema formation in  xxxg779xxx  rats was not aected by the co-injection of the
selective  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  antagonist hoe 140 (10 nmol paw71)
(figure 3a,b).
the treatment of  xxxg779xxx  rats with the cox-2 inhibitor
 xxxd2561xxx  (3 mg kg71, i.p., 1 h) caused a signi®cant

glucocorticoids and b1 receptor expression

inhibition of the oedema induced by des-arg9-bk (54+4%)
in  xxxg779xxx  rats (results not shown). in contrast, the treatment
of  xxxg779xxx  animals with the non selective cox inhibitor
indomethacin (2 mg kg71, i.p., 1 h) produced only a very
slight inhibition of oedema induced by des-arg9-bk (50 nmol
paw71) (results not shown).
the treatment with dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg71, s.c., once
a day for 6 consecutive days) resulted in a signi®cant
inhibition of des-arg9-bk-induced oedema formation
(80+2%), as well as of the portal vein contraction induced
by des-arg9-bk (emax 0.31+0.07 g) (figure 4a,c). desarg9-bk-induced paw oedema in  xxxg779xxx  rats was also
inhibited by previous treatment with pdct (100 mg kg71,
i.p., an inhibitor of the activation of  xxxg1559xxx ) given once a
day for 6 days after surgery (82+3%) (figure 4b). again,
when evaluated in the response of portal vein, the treatment
with pdtc signi®cantly reduced the contractile response
induced by des-arg9-bk (emax from 0.52+0.03 g to
0.35+0.04 g, p50.05) (figure 4d). interestingly, the treatment of  xxxg779xxx  rats with an association of submaximal doses
of dexamethasone (0.05 mg kg71, s.c.) plus pdtc
(10 mg kg71, i.p.) for 6 days (which alone had no eect)

oligonucleotide
figure 6a gives data from the  xxxg1559xxx /dna binding gel shift
assays by using nuclear extracts of lungs obtained from so or
 xxxg779xxx  rats (1 ± 7 days after surgery). nuclear extracts
obtained from lungs of lps-treated rats were used as positive
control for  xxxg1559xxx /dna binding. very low basal levels of
 xxxg1559xxx /dna binding were detected in lung nuclear extracts
obtained from so rats (figure 6a). after 5 days of surgical
ablation of adrenal glands, there was an increase in the
steady-state levels of  xxxg1559xxx /dna binding, an eect which
was more pronounced in 7-day  xxxg779xxx  rats (figure 6a).
protein/dna complexes obtained with lung nuclear extracts
from 7-day  xxxg779xxx  rats were displaced by an excess of
unlabelled  xxxg1559xxx , but not  xxxg2251xxx , double-stranded oligonucleotide, demonstrating the speci®city of  xxxg1559xxx /dna
interaction (figure 6b). the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  in  xxxg779xxx 
rats was also con®rmed when experiments were conducted
with nuclear extracts of paw and heart tissues from so or 7day  xxxg779xxx  rats (figure 6c). in figure 6d it is demonstrated
that dexamethasone, pdtc or the association of very low
doses of dexamethasone and pdtc treatment caused a
complete inhibition of lung's  xxxg1559xxx  activation induced by
adrenalectomy.

effects of adrenalectomy on b1 receptor mrna
expression
the removal of adrenal glands caused an induction of the
expression of b1 receptor mrna obtained from lung tissues
(figure 7). the receptor mrna in lung was observed at 5

glucocorticoids and b1 receptor expression

and 6 days after surgery, and the increment proved to be
intensi®ed on the seventh day after  xxxg779xxx  (figure 7). the
quanti®cation of bands con®rmed the signi®cant increased in
levels of b1 receptor mrna caused by the absence of adrenal
glands, especially 7 days after the surgery (figure 7b).

discussion
the results of the present study provide, for the ®rst time,
considerable pharmacological and molecular evidence to
suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids exert a pivotal role
in controlling the expression of the rat b1 receptor.
earlier studies have demonstrated that various procedures,
such as tissue injury, application of noxious stimulus, certain
cytokines, freund's adjuvant, immune complex arthritis,
chemical colitis or cystitis, heat stress, in vivo desensitization
of b2 receptors, previous treatment of animals with lps or
long-term treatment with mycobacterium bovis calmeâtegueârin (bcg) (dray & perkins, 1993; davis et al., 1994;
campos & calixto, 1995; campos et al., 1996; 1997; lagneux
& ribuot, 1997; lecci et al., 1999, for review see: marceau &
bachvarov, 1998) induce up-regulation of b1 receptors in
many animal species. either in vitro or in vivo treatment with
the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or with protein synthesis
inhibitors largely prevents b1 receptor up-regulation (for
review see: marceau, 1995; 1997). both ourselves and other
researchers have hypothesized that the endogenous glucocorticoids might exert an endogenous modulation of the b1
receptor expression, and such a mechanism could have
clinical relevance in the control of chronic in¯ammatory
processes.
in the present study, in vivo and in vitro pharmacological
and molecular data demonstrate that the endogenous
glucocorticoids have a critical role in controlling b1 receptor
expression. this assumption derives from the view that

suppression of circulating adrenal hormones, either by
surgical (ablation of adrenal glands) or pharmacological
( xxxd2656xxx  treatment) (schulick & brennan, 1977; moore et
al., 1980; cai et al., 1995), resulted in a marked up-regulation
of b1 agonist des-arg9-bk-mediated contraction in portal
vein or paw oedema formation. to explore further whether
the up-regulation of b1 receptor in  xxxg779xxx  rats involves the
increase of b1 receptor expression, we employed a rpa and
b1 kinin receptor encoding mrna was measured in lung
tissues of so and  xxxg779xxx  rats. these experiments revealed
clearly that b1 receptor was expressed in lung of 5 ± 7 day
 xxxg779xxx  rats, while lung of so rats did not show b1 receptor
mrna expression. such results are in accordance with the
increase of functional b1 receptor-mediated responses, as
noted both in vivo (paw oedema) and in vitro (portal vein
contraction) pharmacological models. con®rming our previous studies carried out on rats treated with lps, bcg, or
with pro-in¯ammatory cytokines, or after complete in vivo
desensitization of  xxxg11xxx   xxxg258xxx  (campos & calixto, 1995;
campos et al., 1996; 1997; 1998), the increase in paw oedema
caused by des-arg9-bk in  xxxg779xxx  rats is a speci®c phenombritish journal of pharmacology vol 132 (2)

enon clearly mediated by activation of b1 (but not b2)
receptors, as the selective b1 receptor antagonist des-arg9npc 17731, but not the b2 selective antagonist hoe 140,
almost completely inhibited des-arg9-bk-induced oedema
formation. contrasting with results following acute systemic
treatment of animals with lps where the b1 receptor upregulation is associated with the down-regulation of b2mediated responses (cabrini et al., 1996; campos et al.,
1996), the b1 receptor expression in  xxxg779xxx  animals seems to
be a quite speci®c phenomenon, since the b2 response
induced by selective b2 agonist tyrosine8-bk did not dier
between so and  xxxg779xxx  rats.
con®rming and extending previous observations (campos
et al., 1996; 1997), hormonal replacement of  xxxg779xxx  animals
with dexamethasone, for 6 consecutive days, greatly reduced
the up-regulation of the b1 agonist des-arg9-bk-mediated
oedema formation and contraction of the rat portal vein in
vitro. such results further support the new concept indicating
the de novo protein synthesis of the b1 receptor following
surgical ablation of the adrenal glands, likely involves the
suppression of cytokine synthesis and possibly further actions

facilitating the b1 receptor expression (deblois et al., 1988;
galizzi et al., 1994; levesque et al., 1995; for review see:
marceau, et al., 1998). in addition, con®rming previous
studies (campos et al., 1997; 1998; medeiros et al., 2000),
both the metabolites derived from cox-2 and, to a lesser
extent, those derived from cox-1, appear to largely
contribute to the control of the des-arg9-bk-mediated paw
oedema in  xxxg779xxx  animals. similar results have been reported
by masferrer et al. (1992; 1994) who demonstrated that
peritoneal macrophages obtained from  xxxg779xxx  mice showed an
increase of cox-2 mrna and protein compared to so
animals, this eect being suppressed by dexamethasone
replacement. these ®ndings led the authors to suggest that,
under normal conditions, endogenous glucocorticoids have
an inhibitory action on inducible cox expression. in
addition, it has been demonstrated that adrenalectomy
enhances cytokine expression in several tissues such as spleen,
pituitary and brain in mice (goujon et al., 1996).
adrenalectomy also increases the sensitivity of mice to
lps-induced endotoxic shock (bertini et al., 1988). it has
been shown recently by several groups that glucocorticoids
also interfere with some transcription factors involved in the
in¯ammatory process, including the  xxxg1559xxx /kb family and
ap-1 (scheinman et al., 1995; auphan et al., 1995; mckay &
cidlowski, 1998). thus, the reduction of glucocorticoids
might cause an exacerbation of in¯ammatory response
related to increase of cox-2 expression or synthesis of
pro-in¯ammatory cytokines (bertini et al., 1988; kujubu &
herschman, 1992; masferrer et al., 1992; 1994).
 xxxg1559xxx  is a well-characterized dna-binding factor controlled by regulatory proteins, known as a transcription
factor, which has a relevant role in controlling the
transcription of certain in¯ammatory genes, including
cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and cell adhesion
molecules, among others (barnes & adcock, 1997; barnes &
karin, 1997). normally, the  xxxg1559xxx  proteins are found in the

glucocorticoids and b1 receptor expression

575

cytoplasm as an inactive heterodimer, composed of two
subunities p50 and p65 (rela), coupled to the inhibitory
protein ikb-a. once the cell is stimulated by in¯ammatory
cytokines, the ikb-a is phosphorylated by speci®c protein
kinases, causing its degradation, that then permits the  xxxg1559xxx 
to migrate to the nucleus where it binds to speci®c kb portion
at the promoter of the  xxxg1559xxx -regulated genes and initiates
gene transcription (thanos & maniatis, 1995; baeuerle &
baltimore, 1996; ghosh et al., 1998). there is now evidence
showing that  xxxg1559xxx  exerts a pivotal role in regulating the
molecular mechanisms which modulate the kinin b1 receptor
expression in both in vivo and in in vitro studies. ni et al.
(1998) recently found a sequence containing an  xxxg1559xxx -like
binding site on the promoter of the b1 receptor in the
vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated by in¯ammatory
cytokines like il-1b,  xxxg2296xxx  or by lps. very similar
observations have been made by schanstra et al. (1998),
indicating that expression of kinin b1 receptors in cultured
human lung ®broblasts in response to il-1b is modulated at
the transcriptional level by the activation of  xxxg1559xxx . recent
results from our group have given evidence for the in vivo
participation of  xxxg1559xxx  in the process of up-regulation of b1
receptors in animals treated with either il-1b or with  xxxg2296xxx 
(campos et al., 1999). the ®ndings of the present study
clearly demonstrate that either surgical ablation of adrenal
glands, carried out 7 days prior, or chemical  xxxg779xxx ,
performed through daily treatment of rats with anticancer
drug  xxxd2656xxx  once a day for 10 days, induces an increase in
b1 receptor expression. electromobility shift assay indicate
that in the lung, the change in b1 receptor expression after
surgical ablation of adrenal glands is accompanied by an
increase in  xxxg1559xxx /dna binding. further con®rmation for
the involvement of the  xxxg1559xxx  on b1 receptor expression after
bilateral  xxxg779xxx  came from results showing a marked
inhibition of des-arg9-bk-mediated rat paw oedema, portal
vein contraction and in nuclear extracts of lung tissues from
pdct or dexamethasone-treated rats. although the precise
mechanism for the biological eects of pdtc is still
controversial, several in vitro and in vivo studies showed that
pdtc was a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1559xxx , but had no eect on
ap-1, creb, speci®c protein (sp-1), or octamer-biding
proteins (schreck et al., 1992; liu & malik, 1999; muller et
al., 2000). muller et al. (2000) have recently reported that the
in vivo treatment of rats with pdtc although was found
eective in inhibiting  xxxg1559xxx , it failed to modify ap-1 or any
other transcription factor. as the same eect of pdtc on
 xxxg1559xxx  activation was also obtained when the activation was
caused by adrenalectomy, we could speculate that the upregulation of b1 receptor in our study possibly involve only
the activation of  xxxg1559xxx , and not ap-1 nuclear factor.
the fact that the association of very low doses of
dexamethasone with pdct, that alone had no eect, but
together produced the greatest inhibition of des-arg9-bkmediated response, is very interesting and suggests that both
drugs act via distinct pathways in the process of b1 receptor
expression. the association of low doses of  xxxg1559xxx  inhibitor
and corticosteroid may represent a therapeutic strategy in the
sense of reducing side eects of monotherapy in the
management of in¯ammatory processes. similar synergistic
eect between association of  xxxg1559xxx  inhibitor and dexamethasone have been reported both in vivo (froède-saleh &
calixto, 2000) and ex vivo (medeiros et al., 2000).

in summary, results from the present study, based on both
functional and molecular ®ndings, have demonstrated for the
®rst time that glucocorticoid de®ciency following either
chemical or surgical ablation of adrenal glands dramatically
results in a marked expression of kinin b1 receptor through
an  xxxg1559xxx -mediated mechanism. taken together, these
®ndings support the notion that besides the well-known
pharmacological eects of glucocorticoids in controlling the
in¯ammatory responses, their action is probably, at least in

glucocorticoids and b1 receptor expression

part, related to the modulation of kinin b1 receptor
expression.
