summary. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5 ht)-induced contractions were investigated on cocaine-treated strips of bovine
large coronary arteries.
1. the a2-adrenoceptor blockers rauwolscine and yohimbine antagonized competitively 5 ht-induced contractions.
the estimated equilibrium dissociation constants kb (--log
tool/l) were 7.1 for rauwolscine and 7.3 for yohimbine. the
affinity of yohimbine for the receptors mediating the response to 5 ht appears to be 10 times higher than for
postsynaptic el-adrenoceptors but 10 times lower than for
postsynaptic vascular c~2-adrenoceptors.
2. (-)-noradrenaline and the c~2-adrenoceptor-selective
agonist b-ht 920 caused maximum contractions amounting
to only 20 % and 2 %, respectively, of the maximum 5 h t
effects. neither 60 gmol/1 b-ht 920 nor 1 gmol/1  xxxd3000xxx 
antagonized the 5 ht effect.
3.  xxxd2419xxx  was a competitive antagonist (kb=9.2
(--log mol/1)) of the effects of 5 ht. combinations of
rauwolscine or yohimbine with  xxxd2419xxx  antagonized the
5 ht effects as expected from competition of the 4 drugs for
a single class of receptor.
4. the evidence is consistent with an interaction of 5 ht,
 xxxd2419xxx , rauwolscine and yohimbine with 5 ht2 receptors, c~-adrenoceptors only play a minor role in large
coronary arteries and appear not to be involved in the 5 htinduced contractions. a possible clinical involvement of
5 ht in coronary artery spasm is discussed.
key words: 5 ht2 receptors - large coronary arteries yohimbine - rauwolscine -  xxxd2419xxx 

introduction
5-hydroxytryptamine (5 ht) is a powerful constrictor of
large coronary arteries (brazenor and angus 1981 ; porquet
et al. 1982). using phenoxybenzamine as a tool to block
5 ht d-receptors (gaddum and picarelli 1957), a lowaffinity but heterogeneous receptor population was found in
large coronary arteries of calf (kaumann et al. 1982). one
reason for heterogeneity may be the contribution of eadrenoceptors to the effect of 5 ht (innes 1962), because
phenoxybenzamine also blocks c~-adrenoceptors (nickerson
1970). the blocking effects of the cq-selective antagonist
 xxxd3000xxx  and ez-selective antagonists yohimbine and rauwolscine (starke 1981) were therefore investigated. it is now
reported that both yohimbine and rauwolscine (but not
send offprint requests to the author at the above address

 xxxd3000xxx ) antagonize competitively the effects of 5 ht on
strips of bovine large coronary arteries. moreover, evidence
is presented consistent with the idea that both yohimbine and
rauwolscine block responses to 5 ht by a competitive
interaction at postsynaptic 5 ht2 receptors. part of the
results were recently reported (kaumann 1982).

methods
experiments were carried out at 32.5~ on large coronary
arteries. the arteries were dissected in the slaughterhouse at
room temperature. arteries obtained from freshly excised
hearts were rinsed and cut out in a modified krebs solution
containing (mmol/1): na + 120, k + 5, ca 2+ 2.25, mg 2+ 1,
c1- 98.5, so42- 1, hco~- 29, hpo~- 1, edta 0.04,
equilibrated with 95 % o2 and 5 % co2. the water was
deionized and redistilled in glass. the tissues were transported to the laboratory in a sealed flask containing above
solution. helicoids were cut and then 8 to 10 strips prepared
as roughly isosceles triangles (approximately 4 x 8 ram)
which were set up (usually in pairs) in an apparatus with a 50
ml organ bath (blinks 1965) containing the solution described above supplemented with (mmol/1): na + 20, fumarate 10, pyruvate 5, l-glutamate 5, glucose 10, ascorbate
0.1, cocaine 0.006 (which causes a five-fold potentiation of
the effects of 5 ht (kaumann et al. 1982) probably due to
blockade (thoa et al. 1969) of its neuronal uptake (snipes et
al. 1968)), 0.001 (-)- xxxd384xxx  (used in experiments with
(-)-noradrenaline and b-ht 920 to block/~-adrenoceptors).
each strip was tied on one end to a thread (flexafil 6/0, j.
pfrimmer & co., erlangen, frg) and clamped on the other
end. the strips were attached to strain gauge transducers
connected via amplifiers to polygraphs. resting force was
adjusted to approximately 20 m n and the strips left at the
corresponding length throughout the experiment.
up to 4 successive concentration-effect curves of 5 ht
were determined on each arterial strip. curves were nearly
superimposable and desensitization was always smaller than
0.3 log units. to estimate desensitization, 4 arterial strips
from each heart were routinely used as controls. the
equilibrium dissociation constant kb for an antagonistreceptor complex was calculated from

crd

kb=[~] crb-cr~

where [b] is the concentration of the antagonist, crb the
concentration-ratio of 5 ht (i.e. ecso ratio) in the presence
and absence of [b] and crd the concentration-ratio caused

by desensitization. simple competitive inhibition was
checked with the slope of schild plots (arunlakshana and
schild 1959) modified for desensitization:

reproducible concentration-effect curves for the ~adrenoceptor agonists. up to 60 drool/1 b-ht 920 did not
modify the concentration-effect curve of 5 ht (n = 8 strips of
3 hearts) (not shown). in some arteries the 5 ht effect was
approximately as strong as the contractions caused by 137
mmol/l potassium (fig. 1); in others (not shown) the 5 ht
effect was more pronounced than the potassium-contraction.

simple competition between 5 ht and an antagonist for a
receptor predicts a slope of 1.0 from eq. (2).

the effects of selective ct-adrenoceptor blockers. the cqadrenoceptor blocker  xxxd3000xxx  did not modify the effect of
5 ht at a concentration (1 drool/l) (n = 14 strips of 3 hearts)
(not shown) saturating el-adrenoceptors (starke 1981).
figure 2 shows that rauwolscine and yohimbine cause
parallel shifts of the concentration-effect curves for 5 ht.
with both antagonists the blockade was completely surmounted by 5 ht, consistent with simple competitive inhibition. this mode of blockade is supported by slopes of schild
plots (fig. 2d) not significantly different from 1.0. equilibrium dissociation constants for rauwolscine and yohimbine
are listed in table 1.

drugs. (-)-noradrenaline (-)-tartrate was from merckschuchardt (hohenbrunn b. miinchen, frg), (-)- xxxd384xxx  from sanol (monheim, frg), phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride from smith, kline & french
ltd. (philadelphia, pa, usa), rauwolscine hydrochloride
from roth (karlsruhe, frg),  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride and
5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (serotonin) from sigma
(st. louis, mo, usa), b-ht 920 [6-allyl-2-amino-5,6,7,8tetrahydro-4h-thiazolo-(4,5-d)-azepine] dihydrochloride from
thomae (biberach, frg), and  xxxd1736xxx .

statistics. equilibrium effects of 5 ht, slopes of schild plots,
log values of equilibrium concentration-ratios of 5 h t and
log values of equilibrium dissociation constants are expressed as mean _+ s.e.m.

competitive antagonism by  xxxd2419xxx . the 5 htz receptorselective blocker  xxxd2419xxx  antagonized competitively the
effects of 5 ht (fig. 2c and d). the blocking potency of
 xxxd2419xxx  was approximately 100 times higher than the
blocking potency of rauwolscine and yohimbine (compare
kb values of table 1).

the c~2-adrenoceptor blocker and  xxxd2419xxx  antagonizing the
effects of 5 ht through the same receptor class or through
different receptor classes? if an ~z-adrenoceptor antagonist
and  xxxd2419xxx  both block the same receptor, then the
antagonism in the presence of both antagonists should be
nearly additive (paton and rang 1965). on the other hand, if
one blocks a different receptor than the other, then the
antagonism caused by the two blockers combined should be
equivalent to the product of the blockade of the same
concentrations investigated separately (paton and rang
1965). figure 3 and table 2 show the results of two

discussion

5 ht-induced contractions of large coronary arteries
are not mediated through ~-adrenoceptors
the effect of 5 h t was not antagonized by 1 pmol/1  xxxd3000xxx .
this concentration saturates ~l-adrenoceptors by causing

approximately 99.8 %, 98.7 % and 98.7 % fractional receptor
occupancy in the rabbit p u l m o n a r y artery (calculated from
kb-values for  xxxd3000xxx  of starke (1981)), canine femoral
artery and splenic artery (calculated from data of de mey
and vanhoutte (1981)), respectively. (fractional receptor
occupancy = [b]/([b] + kb), where b is the antagonist.) thus,
a contribution of el-adrenoceptors to the 5 h t effect can be
ruled out.
the blocking potency of yohimbine of e-adrenoceptor
mediated effects has been found to vary more than 100-fold
as a function of both agonist and vascular tissue. starke
(1981) estimated kb-values ( - - l o g mol/1) of 6.4 for the
postsynaptic-adrenoceptor-yohimbinecomplex in the rabbit
pulmonary artery. de mey and vanhoutte (1981) reported
paz-values of 6.5 and 6.6 for yohimbine as antagonist of the
contractile effects of ( - ) - n o r a d r e n a l i n e in canine femoral and
splenic artery, respectively. shepperson and langer (1981)
estimated pa 2 values of 8.6 and 7.5 for yohimbine antagonism of the contractile effects of the ez-selective agonist
m 7 and ( - ) - n o r a d r e n a l i n e , respectively, in dog saphenous
vein. in the same tissue, but treated with phenoxybenzamine,

]52
constantine et al. (1982) estimated a pa2-value of 8.2 for
yohimbine from the antagonism of the effects of clonidine. it
should be pointed out, however, that in most of these reports
only a 10- to 30-fold concentration-range of yohimbine was
used, and that the slope of the schild plot [eq. (2)] was often
different from 1.0. the low affinity estimates of starke (1981 ;
see also weitzell et al. 1979) and de mey and vanhoutte
(1981) probably represent rough approximations of the
equilibrium dissociation constant of yohimbine at ~ladrenoceptors. on the other hand, the high affinity estimates
of shepperson and langer (1981) and of constantine et al.
(1982) probably represent a rough approximation to the
equilibrium dissociation constant of yohimbine for postsynaptic ez-adrenoceptors of dog saphenous vein. the paz of 7.5
for yohimbine against (-)-noradrenaline (shepperson and
langer 1981) perhaps represents just an average affinity for
both subtypes of e-adrenoceptors.
the antagonism by rauwolscine and yohimbine of the
5 ht effect in bovine large coronary arteries may suggest
an involvment of c~2-adrenoceptors. for three reasons,
however, this appears unlikely: 1) in large coronary arteries
the affinity of yohimbine appears to be one order of
magnitude lower for the receptors mediating the response to
5 ht for arterial postsynaptic ez-adrenoceptors (vide supra).
2) (-)-noradrenaline and the e2-adrenoceptor selective
ligand b-i-it 920 exhibit only small or marginal agonistic
activity in large coronary arteries. 3) both rauwolscine and
yohimbine appear to antagonize the 5 ht effects through
5 ht2 receptors (as discussed in the following section).
the small stimulant effects found for (-)-noradrenaline
and b-ht920 suggest that postsynaptic e-adrenoceptors
play a minor role in calf large coronary arteries. the
stimulant effects of (-)-noradrenaline and b-ht 920 cannot
be due to the simultaneous occurrence of/%adrenoceptormediated relaxation, because the concentration of (-) xxxd384xxx  used (1 gmol/1) causes 99.9 ~ /?-adrenoceptor
occupancy (calculated from data in heart (morris et al. 1981)
and smooth muscle (lemoine and kaumann 1982)). because
of the minimal stimulant activity of b-ht 920, this ezadrenoceptor selective ligand was used as a putative antagonist. however, even the rather high concentration of 60
gmol/1 b-ht 920 did not block the 5 ht effect, indicating no
involvement of c~2-adrenoceptors.
evidence from in vivo experiments in canine left circumflex artery indicates that c~2-adrenoceptors mediate coronary
artery constriction (holtz et al. 1982). these authors found
that the constrictor effects of noradrenaline and azepexole,
an e2-adrenoceptor selective agonist, are preferentially antagonized by rauwolscine. holtz et al. (1982) also speculated
that c~2-adrenoceptors might be clinically involved in spasms
of coronary arteries because e2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects are particularly easily antagonized by calcium antagonists (van meel et al. 1981). the present experiments on
bovine large coronary arteries do not support an important
role of ez-adrenoceptors because of the small effects of (-)noradrenaline and marginal effects of the e2-adrenoceptor
selective agonist b-ht 920. the results of holtz et al. (1982)
may rather reflect a role of e2-adrenoceptors in small
coronary arteries or arterioles. in contrast to the effects seen
with noradrenaline, small coronary arteries do not contract
(porquet et al. 1982) and may even dilate with 5 ht (mena
and vidrio 1976).
because c~-adrenoceptors do not appear to mediate 5 htinduced contractions, the heterogeneity of the low-affinity

receptor population for 5 ht (kaumann et al. 1982) appears
to be unrelated to c~-adrenoceptors. the slopes of schild plots
were found not to be significantly different from 1.0 for
 xxxd2419xxx , rauwolscine and yohimbine, consistent with a
single class of antagonist-5 hit2receptor complex. however,
receptor heterogeneity can be concealed even in results with
slopes of 1.0 of schild plots (lemoine and kaumann 1983).
further work with 5 ht-like agonists (feniuk et al. 1981) is
necessary in order to search for receptor heterogeneity. a
plausible agonist-dependence of the antagonism by  xxxd2419xxx , yohimbine and rauwolscine would be an indication for
5 ht receptor heterogeneity. the question of 5 ht receptor
subtypes in large coronary arteries (kaumann et al. 1982)
could also be clarified by using at least 9 blocker concentrations per schild plot as in a recent analysis of /~adrenoceptor heterogeneity (lemoine and kaumann 1983).

antagonism of 5 h t effects by  xxxd2419xxx , rauwolscine
and yohimbine through 5 htz receptors
 xxxd2419xxx  is a high affinity ligand (leysen et at. 1981,
1982; van nueten et al. 1981) for 5 ht2 receptors (peroutka and snyder 1979).  xxxd2419xxx  was a simple competitive antagonist in bovine large coronary arteries. for
unknown reasons brazenor and angus (1982) found that
 xxxd2419xxx  was a non-competitive antagonist of the effects of
5 ht in dog circumflex arteries. the kb value estimated for
the  xxxd2419xxx -5 ht receptor complex of bovine large coronary arteries agrees (table 1) well with similar affinity values
estimated for a variety of arteries (van nueten et al. 1981).
the evidence is, therefore, consistent with the existence of
5 ht2 receptors in large coronary arteries. furthermore, the
experiments with combinations of antagonists (fig. 3) and
the analysis of table 2 suggest that  xxxd2419xxx  and rauwolscine or yohimbine act additively through 5 ht2 receptors.
interestingly, lambert et al. (1978) found that both
yohimbine and rauwolscine antagonized 5 ht-induced contractions in the rat fundus. they estimated - l o g kb values
(tool/l,)7 _+sem) of 6.77 ___0.13 for yohimbine and 7.48 + 0.45
for rauwolscine. the data have to be interpreted with some
caution because lambert et al. (1978) reported neither the
concentration-range used with yohimbine and rauwolscine
nor the slopes of the corresponding schild plots. nevertheless, the similarity of these affinity estimates with the
corresponding affinity estimates for yohimbine and rauwolscine on bovine large coronary arteries suggests at first glance
that the 5 ht receptors of both tissues are similar. however,
the affinity of yohimbine appears to be at least 3 times lower
for 5 ht receptors of rat fundus than for 5 ht receptors of
bovine large coronary arteries. furthermore, and more
importantly, the effects of 5 ht on rat fundus are not
antagonized by concentrations of  xxxd2419xxx  up to 104 times
greater than the ecso for blockade of 5 ht contractions of
rat caudal arteries (awouters et al. 1982). it is therefore
concluded that 5 ht receptors of rat fundus and large bovine
coronary arteries are different.
the affinities of yohimbine and rauwolscine were found
to be approximately 1/100 of the affinity of  xxxd2419xxx  for
5 ht receptors, as estimated from the blockade of the
contractile effects of 5 ht in bovine large coronary arteries.
binding-inhibition data of leysen et al. (1982) suggest that
the affinity of yohimbine is only 1/1000 of the affinity of
 xxxd2419xxx  for 5 ht2 receptors of rat brain membranes
