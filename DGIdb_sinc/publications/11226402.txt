1. introduction
the a 2-adrenoceptor has been shown to exhibit subtype
heterogeneity that may serve as the basis for development
of drugs with improved therapeutic and safety profiles
žbylund et al., 1995; smith et al., 1997.. to date, three
human a 2-adrenoceptor subtypes ž a 2a , a 2b and a 2c .
have been classified using functional and molecular techniques žbylund et al., 1995.. clonidine,  xxxd201xxx ,
guanfacine and  xxxd2241xxx  are examples of a 2-adrenoceptor type-selective but subtype non-selective drugs. these
agents are used therapeutically to lower blood pressure,

reduce intraocular pressure and for aiding withdrawal from
narcotics, alcohol and tobacco addictions žhoffman and
lefkowitz, 1996..
the a 2-adrenoceptor subtypes exhibit distinct distributions in the central nervous system žcns. and the periphery žnicholas et al., 1996; smith et al., 1997.. thus, the
development of a 2-adrenoceptor subtype-selective agents
may allow more precisely targeted therapy compared to
current nonspecific a 2-adrenoceptor drugs.
the physiological role of the a 2c -adrenoceptor subtype
in autonomic cardiovascular function has been defined
with the use of the recently developed a 2c -adrenoceptor
subtype specific knockout mice žmacdonald et al., 1997..
findings from cardiovascular studies using a 2a -, a 2b - and
a 2c -adrenoceptor knockout mice indicate that, while the
peripheral a 2a - and a 2b -adrenoceptor modulate blood

pressure, the a 2c -adrenoceptor does not play a measurable
role in the control of systemic blood pressure žmacdonald
et al., 1997.. this finding is consistent with the notion that
an a 2c -adrenoceptor selective drug has a minimized potential for systemic blood pressure effects. the development
of a 2c -adrenoceptor subtype-selective agonists and antagonists will help to further elucidate the physiological roležs.
of this receptor and may provide leads for a variety of
therapeutic areas. towards this end, a functional human
a 2c -adrenoceptor bioassay would be valuable in the development of and functional characterization of subtype-selective agonists and antagonists.
human saphenous vein is readily available from coronary artery bypass graft surgery ždocherty, 1987.. recently, in human saphenous vein derived from varicose
vein surgery, the postjunctional a-adrenoceptor contractility has been shown to be mediated predominantly by an
a 2-adrenoceptor žsmith et al., 1992; steen et al., 1984..
moreover, studies by gavin et al. ž1997. indicate this
a 2-adrenoceptor response is largely mediated by the a 2c adrenoceptor subtype. the present investigations evaluate
the potential of human saphenous vein from coronary
artery bypass graft surgery to serve as an a 2c -adrenoceptor bioassay. to this end, the postjunctional a-adrenoceptor-mediated contractility of human saphenous vein was
studied using the selective a 2-adrenoceptor agonists bht920 žmacia et al., 1984. and uk 14,304 žde ponti et al.,
1996. and the a 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine žde
ponti et al., 1996.. the a 2-adrenoceptor antagonist activity
of yohimbine žde ponti et al., 1996., arc 239 žparsley et
al., 1999., wb 4101 žparsley et al., 1999. and hv 723
žmuramatsu et al., 1990. was determined against bht-920
in human saphenous vein. affinity estimates for these
a-adrenoceptor antagonists at the recombinant human a 2a -,
a 2b - and a 2c -adrenoceptor were obtained in binding assays using cells expressing single receptor subtypes. the
resulting functional human saphenous vein potencies and
recombinant human a 2-adrenoceptor subtype binding
affinities for the four antagonists were subjected to correlation analysis to further characterize the a 2-adrenoceptor
contractile responses in human saphenous vein.

2. methods
2.1. human saphenous õein
human saphenous vein was obtained from coronary
artery bypass graft surgery patients with a known age
range of 49 to 83 years. human saphenous vein from 36
predominantly ž) 75%. male patients were procured by
morristown memorial hospital žmmh, morristown, nj,
usa. and the hackensack university medical center institute for biomedical research žhumc, hackensack, nj,
usa.. mmh human saphenous vein were stored and
shipped at 48c in roswell park memorial institute žrpmi.

solution with 25 mm hepes buffer, glutamax i, minimal
essential media žmem. vitamin and nonessential amino
acid solutions, antibioticrantimycologic solutions and
10,000 urml heparin žgibco, grand island, ny.. humc
human saphenous vein were stored and shipped at 48c in
heparinized autologous blood. mmh human saphenous
vein was received at the schering-plough research institute žspri. 24–72 h post removal. humc human saphenous vein was received within 24 h of removal. on the day
of arrival, human saphenous vein was either used fresh or
cryopreserved for use at a later date.
2.2. cryopreserõation of human saphenous õein
cryopreservation methods used have been previously
described in valentine et al. ž1999.. cryopreservation preserves functional neuromuscular activity in a variety of
blood vessels žellis and muller-schweinitzer,
1991; valen¨
tine et al., 1999.. briefly, human saphenous vein ring
segments 5 mm long and 3–7 mm in diameter were placed
into nunc cryovials q.s. to 1.8 ml with chilled, heat
inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 1.8 m dimethyl
sulfoxide ždmso. and 0.1 m sucrose. the vials were
placed in a nalgene cryofreezing container equilibrated at
48c for 10 min and then transferred to y808c overnight
for controlled freezing. the cryovials were then removed
from the cryofreezing container and stored at y808c until
use. cryopreserved human saphenous vein was thawed
within 2.5 min using a dry bath heating unit. the vessel
rings were immediately transferred to chilled rpmi solution.
2.3. functional a-adrenoceptor bioassay in human saphenous õein
stainless steel tissue hooks and 2-0 silk were used to
anchor the human saphenous vein ring segments in 25.0 ml
organ baths žq-bath, radnoti glass technology, monrovia, ca. and attach them to grass ft-03 force transducers žastro-med, west warick, ri.. isometric tension was
continuously recorded using a model k2g physiograph
žastro-med.. the organ baths were filled with a ph 7.4
krebs-style buffer ž118 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 1.2 mm
 xxxd2534xxx  , 1.2 mm kh 2 po4 , 24.9 mm nahco 3 , 11.1 mm
glucose, 2.55 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 . maintained at 378c and continuously aerated with 95% o 2 –5% co 2 gas. rings were
placed under 1.0 g initial resting tension and equilibrated
for 2 to 3 h. tissues were tested for responsiveness with
norepinephrine ž100 mm. and washed during the equilibration period. during the experimental portions of the procedure, contractions to rising cumulative concentrations of an
agonist were observed in the absence or presence of an
antagonist. antagonist equilibration time was 1 h before
the agonist challenge. upon completion of the experiment,
a kcl ž80 mm.-induced contraction was performed.

2.4. ligand binding studies
chinese hamster ovary žcho.-k1 cells stably expressing the recombinant human a 2a -, a 2b - and a 2c -adrenoceptor were grown in complete ham’s f12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 iurml penicillin, 50
mgrml streptomycin and 400 mgrml  xxxg418xxx . membranes
from each cell type were prepared by homogenizing the
cells in buffer containing 15 mm tris–hcl ph 7.5, 2 mm
mgcl 2 , 0.3 mm edta and 1 mm egta, followed by
two consecutive centrifugation steps at 40,000 = g for 25
min separated by a wash in the same buffer. membranes
were resuspended in buffer containing 7.5 mm tris–hcl
ph 7.5, 12.5 mm mgcl 2 , 0.3 mm edta, 1 mm egta
and 250 mm sucrose. protein was quantitated using the
bio-rad protein assay žhercules, ca, usa.. for saturation analyses, 5, 25 or 10 mg membrane protein from
cho-k1 cells expressing the recombinant human a 2a -,
a 2b - or a 2c -adrenoceptor, respectively, was incubated with
the radioligand, w3 hxrauwolscine, in a final volume of 200
ml binding buffer ž75 mm tris–hcl ph 7.4, 12.5 mm
mgcl 2 , 2 mm edta. per well of 96 well plates for 1 h at
room temperature. total and nonspecific binding were
determined in quadruplicate. nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1–10 mm yohimbine. competition
binding studies were performed using 1–2.5 nm
w3 hxrauwolscine ž0.5 to 2 times the k d value depending
on the receptor. and eight concentrations of cold competitor
ligand in triplicate or quadruplicate. assays were terminated by rapid filtration through gfrc unifilter plates,
presoaked with 0.3% polyethylenimine, with five washes
of 0.5 ml cold 50 mm tris–hcl ph 7.4 buffer, using a
packard filtermate harvester. after drying, bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting
žpackard topcount. with microscint 20, 50 mlrwell.

a strong correlation and a regression slope of unity
ž r s 0.98, slope s 1.0. were obtained when the yohimbine,

from the human saphenous vein bioassay were compared
with their respective recombinant human a 2c -adrenoceptor

performed using the p k i values from the recombinant

4. discussion
postjunctional a-adrenergic contractile responses of
blood vessels are mediated by the a 1- and a 2-adrenoceptor types žmacia et al., 1984; mcgrath et al., 1989.. in the
present investigations, the predominant postjunctional a 2adrenoceptor subtype of coronary artery bypass graft
surgery human saphenous vein was characterized as an
a 2c -adrenoceptor.
previous investigations have evaluated the role of the
postjunctional a 1- and a 2-adrenoceptor in responses of
human saphenous vein derived from coronary artery bypass graft surgery and varicose vein surgery ždocherty and
hyland, 1986; gavin et al., 1997; muller-schweinitzer,
¨
1984; roberts et al., 1992; smith et al., 1992; steen et al.,
1984; weinstein et al., 1989.. in the present study using
coronary artery bypass graft surgery-derived human saphenous vein, the agonist potency displayed by bht-920 and
uk 14,304 and the antagonist sensitivity of bht-920
indicated that contractility was mediated by an a 2-adrenoceptor. additionally, the human saphenous vein contracted to the selective a 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine, which produced greater peak responses than
bht-920 but was about 100-fold less potent. the present
contractile potency estimate for phenylephrine lies within
the range of phenylephrine binding affinity found at recombinant a 1-adrenoceptor subtypes že.g. k d range s
1.4–47.8 mm, lomasney et al., 1991.. however, this
functional potency estimate is somewhat reduced relative
to previous functional potency values obtained in human
saphenous vein. the previous pec 50 values of 5.3 žsteen
et al., 1984. and 5.7 žweinstein et al., 1989. were obtained
using methods that differed in the surgical populations
used, the portion of the vascular bed studied and tissue
storage and assay conditions employed, including the presence of endothelium or neuronal uptake and b-adrenoceptor blockade. such experimental variables may account

for the differences in phenylephrine contractile potency
observed in these preparations. nonetheless,  xxxd3000xxx  potently inhibited the phenylephrine contractions in the present investigations, thus indicating activity via the a 1adrenoceptor. the present finding that the postjunctional
a 2- and a 1-adrenoceptors mediate contractility in coronary
artery bypass graft surgery human saphenous vein is consistent with earlier studies ždocherty and hyland, 1986;
roberts et al., 1992; weinstein et al., 1989.. in varicose
vein surgery-derived human saphenous vein, the postjunctional a-adrenoceptor contractility was found by others to
be mediated predominantly by an a 2-adrenoceptor žsmith
et al., 1992; steen et al., 1984. identified as an a 2c -adrenoceptor žgavin et al., 1997..
subtype selective agonists or antagonists for the a 2a -,
a 2b - and a 2c -adrenoceptor have presently not been identified. thus, pharmacological identification of a 2-adrenoceptor subtypes has required correlation of cell or tissue
a-adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist rank order potency
with ligand binding affinity in a 2-adrenoceptor subtype
monoreceptor assays žgavin et al., 1997; paiva et al.,
1999; rump et al., 1995; smith et al., 1992; trendelenburg
et al., 1994; trendelenburg et al., 1997.. in the present
study, we characterized a postjunctional human saphenous
vein a 2c -adrenoceptor using the agonist bht-920 and the
a-adrenoceptor antagonist pair arc 239 and wb 4101.
other studies have demonstrated arc 239 selectivity for
the a 2c - and a 2b -adrenoceptor subtypes and wb 4101
selectivity for the a 2c - and a 2a -adrenoceptor subtypes
žparsley et al., 1999; paiva et al., 1999.. thus, the display
of a relatively high potency by both compounds at an
a 2-adrenoceptor identifies the a 2c -subtype žparsley et al.,
1999.. in the present human saphenous vein assay, relatively high potency was displayed by arc 239 and wb
4101 against bht-920. these potency estimates for arc
239 and wb 4101 were consistent with the human a 2c adrenoceptor p k b estimates of 7.1 and 8.1, respectively,
found by parsley et al. ž1999. and the human a 2c -adrenoceptor p k b estimates of 7.2 and 7.9, respectively, found by
gavin et al. ž1997.. in contrast, other studies have demonstrated relatively low affinity for arc 239 at the human
a 2a -adrenoceptor žp k irp k d f 6.3, trendelenburg et al.,
1997; smith et al., 1992. and for wb 4101 at the human
a 2b -adrenoceptor žp k i s 7.5, smith et al., 1992.. in addition to arc 239 and wb 4101, the a-adrenoceptor antagonist hv 723 was also evaluated against bht-920 in the
present human saphenous vein assay. hv 723 has been
shown to be weakly selective for the a 2c -adrenoceptor
over the a 2a - and a 2b -adrenoceptor. others have obtained
hv 723 p k i or p k b estimates of g 7.5 at the human
a 2c -adrenoceptor, f 7.2 at the rat a 2b -adrenoceptor and
6.6 at the human a 2a -adrenoceptor žgavin et al., 1997;
smith et al., 1992.. in the present human saphenous vein
bioassay, the potency of hv 723 was consistent with
activity at the a 2c -adrenoceptor. taken together, the activities of arc 239, wb 4101 and hv 723 observed against

c.a. rizzo et al.r european journal of pharmacology 413 (2001) 263–269

bht-920 in the human saphenous vein bioassay provide
strong support for a 2c -adrenoceptor mediated contractility.
in this study, the binding affinity žp k i . estimates obtained for arc 239, wb 4101 and hv 723 at the recombinant human a 2a -, a 2b - and a 2c -adrenoceptors were
consistent with their previously demonstrated subtype selectivities. the present pattern of correlation coefficient
and slope that resulted from comparisons of p a 2 or p k b
values for yohimbine, arc 239, wb 4101 and hv 723
against bht-920 contractions in human saphenous vein
with the recombinant human a 2a - and a 2c -adrenoceptor
subtype p k i values was the pattern predicted if the contractile receptor was the a 2c -adrenoceptor. furthermore,
we observed no correlation between the human saphenous
vein p a 2 or p k b values and the binding affinities at the
recombinant human a 2b -adrenoceptor subtype. considered
together, the results of the present three correlation analyses indicate that the contractile response to a 2-adrenoceptor agonists is mediated predominantly by a postjunctional
a 2c -adrenoceptor. the present correlation analysis also
concurs with the correlation analysis performed by gavin
et al. ž1997. using varicose vein surgery-derived human
saphenous vein.
in conclusion, postjunctional a 2-adrenoceptor contractility of human saphenous vein derived from coronary
artery bypass graft surgery is mediated predominantly via
the a 2c -adrenoceptor. this preparation represents a functional bioassay for studying human a 2c -adrenoceptor
pharmacology.
