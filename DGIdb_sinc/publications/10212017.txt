affinities of  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine, and
terfenadine at the five human muscarinic cholinergic
receptor subtypes

anticholinergic effects are presumed to be the mechanism for the efficacy of
chlorpheniramine in symptomatic relief of the common cold. terfenadine, a
second-generation antihistamine, reportedly lacks anticholinergic side effects.
we evaluated affinities of two commonly used over-the-counter
antihistamines,  xxxd375xxx  and chlorpheniramine, as well as
terfenadine in comparison with atropine at the five human muscarinic
cholinergic receptor subtypes using cho cells stably transfected with the
individual subtypes. atropine was more potent than all three drugs at m1–m5
(p<0.01). no significant difference was observed between chlorpheniramine
and  xxxd375xxx . atropine,  xxxd375xxx , and chlorpheniramine
could not discriminate between m1–m5. terfenadine demonstrated subtype
selectivity at m3. in vitro comparisons in human muscarinic receptor
subtypes could potentially be used to predict clinical anticholinergic effects of
antihistamines and to target receptor-specific effects of such agents.
(pharmacotherapy 1999;19(4):447–451)
 xxxd375xxx  and chlorpheniramine are
two structurally similar and commonly used
histamine h1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines)
that have been available for almost 50 years.
terfenadine is a second-generation antihistamine
that once ranked among the top 20 most
frequently prescribed drugs in the united states.1
despite a great deal of clinical experience with
them, their basic and clinical pharmacology is
incompletely characterized.

symptoms of allergic rhinitis based on their

and chlorpheniramine are alkylamine antihistamines and appear to have comparable
efficacy providing symptomatic relief of allergic
rhinitis.2–4 both drugs have similar side effects
including anorexia, drowsiness, and sedation. 5
adverse effects attributed to blockade of
muscarinic cholinergic receptors include dry
mouth and urinary retention. 5 the prominent
presumed anticholinergic effects of older
antihistamines led to development of newer
antihistamines with fewer of these side effects.
terfenadine is a piperidine antihistamine
structurally dissimilar from  xxxd375xxx 
and chlorpheniramine, which has been
administered to treat allergic rhinitis. like other
second-generation antihistamines, it is not
sedating and, unlike the classic antihistamines,
does not cause dry mouth and urinary retention.5
for more than 40 years, controversy has
surrounded treatment of symptoms of the
common cold with antihistamines.6–9 the only

antihistamines with this food and drug administration-approved indication are chlorpheniramine,
doxylamine, and clemastine. the putative
mechanism for their beneficial effect in this
setting is their affinity for muscarinic cholinergic
receptors. studies evaluated the anticholinergic
potency of several antihistamines using muscarinic
cholinergic receptors from rat brain.10 however, the
potency of  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine,
and terfenadine at human muscarinic receptor
subtypes has not been described.
the purpose of this study was to characterize
the selectivity and relative potencies of  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine, and terfenadine
at the five known subtypes of the human
muscarinic cholinergic receptor. characterization
of affinities of the agents for the receptor would
help explain similarities or differences among
them in terms of clinical effect.

[ 3 h]-n-methyl-scopolamine binding to
membrane preparations was performed in 0.3 ml
total volume containing the indicated amount of
membranes (see above), 0.6 nm [3h]-n-methylscopolamine, and indicated amounts of h 1 antagonist. nonspecific binding was determined
in the presence of 10 µm atropine. drugs were
diluted in buffer or dimethylsulfoxide (dmso)
for terfenadine. atropine was diluted in dmso
when used to define nonspecific binding for
terfenadine studies. samples were incubated for
2.5 hours at 25°c. the reaction was stopped by
adding 10 ml ice-cold te buffer. samples were
filtered by vacuum filtration through glass-fiber
filters to retain membrane-bound radioligand.
filters were washed 2 times with 5 ml of ice-cold
buffer. radioactivity remaining on the filters was
counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
samples were analyzed in triplicate.

methods

data analysis

muscarinic receptor assay

nonlinear regression was used to determine
the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for each
displacement curve.11 for muscarinic receptor
subtypes results from three separate binding
experiments are expressed as mean values ± sd
for the (-)log ic50. comparisons of results for
each receptor subtype were analyzed by analysis
of variance and neuman-keuls multiple
comparison test.

muscarinic receptor membranes were prepared
from chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells stably
transfected with individual subtypes of human
muscarinic cholinergic receptors m1–m5. the
cho cells were grown in medium containing
dmem/f12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, glutamine 2 mm, penicillin 100 u/ml, and
streptomycin 0.1 mg/ml, and were grown at 37°c
in humidified air supplemented with 8% co2.
confluent cells were harvested by scraping and
homogenized in te buffer (10 mm tris hcl, ph
7.4, 1 mm edta) with a tekmar tissuemizer
(setting 60) for 10 seconds. homogenates were
centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 20 minutes. pellets
were resuspended in te buffer at a protein
concentration of 2 mg/ml. protein concentrations
of membranes from each subtype used in each
assay were 35 µg m1, 5 µg m2, 25 µg m3, 45 µg
m4, and 67 µg m5. protein concentrations were
determined using the bca protein assay.

materials
(±)-chlorpheniramine maleate, terfenadine,
and atropine were purchased from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
(±) xxxd375xxx  maleate was obtained from
whitehall-robins healthcare (madison, nj).
protein was determined by the pierce bca
protein assay (rockford, il). [3h]-n-methylscopolamine (specific activity 82 ci/mmol) was
purchased from amersham corporation
(arlington heights, il).

results
table 1 is a summary of results of receptorbinding studies at the human muscarinic
cholinergic receptor. atropine was used as the
standard and shows high affinity for all subtypes
of the receptor. the h 1-receptor antagonists
 xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine, and
terfenadine were significantly less potent than
atropine (p<0.01) at all subtypes. atropine,
 xxxd375xxx , and chlorpheniramine could
not discriminate between m1–m5. no significant
difference was observed between chlorpheniramine
and  xxxd375xxx . terfenadine’s affinity was
significantly less than atropine’s, and significantly
greater than  xxxd375xxx ’s and chlorpheniramine’s
at m3 (p<0.01). terfenadine was 5 times more
potent at m3 than at m4 (p<0.05). representative
curves are shown in figure 1.

terfenadine and not for the other drugs, our
results are in agreement with those of in vitro
studies.10, 13
knowledge of receptor subtype distribution
could potentially be used to target specific
receptors for selected effects. in rat peripheral
tissues, subtype-selective antisera determined
muscarinic receptor subtype distribution for m1,
m2, and m3, and showed that m2 accounts for
70–90% of muscarinic receptors in bladder,
lungs, and ileum, with m3 accounting for
5–11%.14 in contrast, rabbit lung contains m2
and m4 receptors.15
the m3 muscarinic cholinergic receptor mrna
was identified in epithelial cells, serous and
mucous cells of submucosal glands, and

discussion
clinical effects of classic antihistamines,
including symptomatic treatment of the common
cold, as well as adverse effects, including dry
mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention, are
attributed to the drugs’ affinities for muscarinic
cholinergic receptors. as shown by data reported
here,  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine, and
terfenadine are approximately equivalent in their
potencies at human m1–m5. their affinities for
these receptors are significantly less than that of
atropine.
to our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of
 xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine, and
terfenadine at the five subtypes of the human
muscarinic cholinergic receptor. the availability
of the cloned human receptor subtypes as a
research tool is potentially important for comparison of in vitro affinities of antihistamines.
previous research evaluated the potencies of
chlorpheniramine,  xxxd375xxx , and
terfenadine at the muscarinic cholinergic
receptor in bovine cortex and rat brain.10, 12, 13
those studies reported an 50% effective
concentration (ec 50 ) of the three agents of
approximately 20 µm10, 13 for rat brain receptors.
affinities in the present study are in agreement.
although terfenadine is commonly described as
lacking effects at muscarinic cholinergic
receptors,5 compared with  xxxd375xxx  and
chlorpheniramine it has equivalent or greater
potency at the five human subtypes in vitro.
although a direct comparison between terfenadine
and  xxxd375xxx  or chlorpheniramine must
be tempered by the use of dmso as a diluent for

binding to cho cells stably transfected with the indicated
muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes m1–m5 in the
presence of atropine,  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine,
or terfenadine. representative curves are shown.

endothelial cells of human nasal mucosa.16 nasal
provocation studies showed the pharmacologically
defined m1 and m3 receptors to be present and
to regulate secretion of mucus glycoproteins in
human nasal mucosa. 17 generally, these
pharmacologically defined receptors (m1 and
m3) correspond to m1 and m4, and m3,
respectively.18 it is likely that activity at specific
subtypes localized in various tissues accounts for
therapeutic and adverse effects of antihistamines.
for example, m1, m3, and m4 may be target
receptors in human nasal mucosa for treating
symptoms of allergic rhinitis or common cold.
other subtypes may responsible for effects such
as urinary retention in peripheral tissues such as
the bladder. characterization of any subtype
selectivity of these drugs would be helpful in
understanding their effects and in targeting
specific receptors in new drug development.
we did not find human muscarinic cholinergic
receptor subtype selectivity for  xxxd375xxx 
or chlorpheniramine, nor did the two drugs
appear pharmacologically different at any
subtype. this is in agreement with an in vitro
functional study in which no differences were
observed between  xxxd375xxx  and chlorpheniramine in reducing  xxxd2586xxx -induced
secretion from human nasal mucosa explants.19
lack of subtype selectivity also was observed for
 xxxd1785xxx  and diphenhydramine.20, 21
terfenadine, in contrast to first-generation
antihistamines evaluated, has approximately 5fold selectivity for human m3, as shown in the
present study. clinically, it does not have effects
that could be attributed to the muscarinic
cholinergic receptor. in humans, a single 60-mg
dose of terfenadine had no effect on citric acidstimulated salivary flow, 22 mediated in part by
cholinergic receptors,23 whereas a single 8-mg
dose of chlorpheniramine significantly reduced
it.22 oral terfenadine had no benefit in relieving
symptoms of the common cold. 24 lack of
anticholinergic effect after oral administration is
most likely due to rapid metabolism of the drug
to its acid metabolite fexofenadine, allowing for
little accumulation of parent compound.
however, it is conceivable that if terfenadine
were applied topically to nasal membranes, as is
currently the method of delivery for some
antihistamines, it would have a local
anticholinergic effect in these tissues in which
m3 receptors play a role in human nasal mucosal
secretions.17
in summary,  xxxd375xxx  and
chlorpheniramine did not discriminate between

human muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes
and terfenadine showed selectivity for the human
 xxxg449xxx  subtype. in vitro comparisons with
human muscarinic receptor subtypes could help
explain similarities or differences between
clinically observed anticholinergic effects of
antihistamines and could potentially target
receptor-specific effects of such agents.
