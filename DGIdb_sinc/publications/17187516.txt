 xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) represents an example of a fused molecule that targets cells
bearing high affinity interleukin-2 receptors internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis
in an acidified vesicle.  xxxd1832xxx  is proteolytically cleaved within the endosome
liberating the enzymatically active portion of the diphtheria toxin, the a fragment.
diphtheria toxin fragment a is released into the cytosol inhibiting the protein synthesis
through the adp-ribosylation of the elongation factor-2, and leading to cell death. this
review focuses on the clinical trials that led to the fda approval of the drug for cutaneous t
cell lymphoma in the us, and investigational studies demonstrating drug-activity against b
and t-cell non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma and acute graft
versus disease within allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

surface-targeted biological therapy is an
emerging modality of treating cancer based on
the principle that cancer cells express antigens
or proteins on the surface enabling the binding
of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) or recombinant hybrid of toxin and receptor ligand [1].
cancer treatment has classically consisted of
multimodality encompassing surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. rapidly proliferating or growing tumor cells are notoriously
more sensitive to chemotherapy, albeit they
inevitably encounter resistance to most of the
agents used either singly or in combination.
the persistence of surface markers even in
chemo- or radioresistant tumor cells represents
an advantage in terms of diagnosis for their
identification and treatment when mabs are
used for the purpose [1]. so far, three different
modalities of surface-targeted biological therapy have been approved by the us fda for
the treatment of lymphoproliferative disorders
(e.g., the definition in this review encompasses
cutaneous t cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ), band
t cell non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl), and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll)) in the
usa. rituximab (rituxan®, genentech) and
10.1586/14737140.7.1.11

alemtuzumab (campath®, genzyme) represent examples of us fda-approved surfacetargeted biological therapies utilizing unlabeled humanized mabs directed to surface
cd20 and  xxxg393xxx  present on large part of
b cell nhl and cll, respectively [2,3]. these
new humanized mabs are highly active in
patients via mechanisms of single cell directedapoptosis, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity
(adcc) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (cdcc) [4]. more recently, murine and
humanized mabs have been conjugated to
radionuclides with the intent of killing tumor
cells without relying on the mechanisms previously described for unlabeled mabs [5,6]. the
new modality, named radioimmunotherapy
(rit), is based on the use of the radiolabeled
yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuexetan (zevalin®,
biogen) and iodine-131  xxxd3405xxx 
(bexxar®, glaxosmithkline) mabs and it is
directed to surface cd20 [5,6]. in rit, the
crossfire effect of the radioactive compound
yttrium or iodine overcomes the limitations of
the unlabeled counterparts [5,6]. however, the
rit is mainly limited by the potency of the
radionuclide and the number of radionuclide

molecules which can be bound to each mab. this may represent a limitation for patients with bulky tumors. in the attempt
of improving the killing of surface-targeted biological therapy,
protein toxins capable of inducing killing by a single molecule
were molecularly engineered to be connected to ligands which
can bind to receptors of cancer cells [1].  xxxd1832xxx 
(dab389-il-2,  xxxd1832xxx ®) represents an example of this modality
that was recently approved by the fda, hence the bacterial-derived truncated diphtheria toxin (dt) is fused to a
binding subunit for the interleukin (il)-2 receptor ( xxxg1175xxx ) [1].
the fused molecule dab389-il-2 targets high affinity il-2
receptor ( xxxg1175xxx ), a heterotrimeric receptor complex of alpha
(cd25,  xxxg1174xxx ), beta ( xxxg1175xxx , p17) and gamma ( xxxg1176xxx ,  xxxg1176xxx ) [1]. the
il-2 moiety of the compound binds the fusion protein to cells
bearing  xxxg1175xxx  and is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis in an acidified vesicle [1,7]. upon internalization and
acidification,  xxxd1832xxx  is proteolytically cleaved
within the endosome liberating the enzymatically active portion of the fusion protein, the a fragment (dta). dta is
released into the cytosol where it inhibits the protein synthesis
through the adp-ribosylation of the elongation factor-2 (ef2),
leading to cell death [7]. the expression of the  xxxg1175xxx  subunits
regulates the receptor’s binding affinity of the target cells
derived from various lymphomas as shown in a pivotal in vitro
study by re and collaborators [8]. the low-affinity  xxxg1175xxx , made
of heterodimers of  xxxg216xxx  with or without  xxxg218xxx , has a
limited function in internalizing the ligand, whereas the intermediate (beta and gamma subunits) or the high (alpha,beta and gamma subunits)-affinity receptor is capable of internalizing the ligand,
with the latter showing the higher efficiency [1,9].
seminal work with  xxxd1832xxx  began in the 1980s
which led to dab486il-2 first generation compound, a 60 kda
protein containing the first 486 amino acid sequence of the dt
and the full sequence of il-2 [9]. the very initial phase i clinical
trials published during the early 1990s with this compound
included patients with hodgkin’s lymphoma (hl), nhl and
 xxxg2343xxx  based on the likelihood of these tumors expressing
cd25 subunits of the  xxxg1175xxx  [9]. these initial studies were relevant in defining the potential target population of patients with
a level of response in an order of magnitude
 xxxg2343xxx >>>nhl>>hl [10–12]. modifications of the dab486il-2
molecule resulted in the development of the actual
dab389-il-2 which was tested in subsequent clinical trials
leading to the fda approval for the treatment of persistent or
relapsed  xxxg2343xxx . dab389-il-2 is 97 amino acids shorter than
the parental compound and it translates in five-fold higher
affinity for the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx  and ten-fold increase in
potency resulting from increased half life and enhanced in vitro
cytotoxicity [9].
pharmacokinetics & pharmacodynamics

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1832xxx  was investigated in
a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation (3 to 31 µg/kg/day),
phase i trial in which patients with preserved organ function,
relapsed  xxxg2343xxx , nhl or hl were enrolled if their tumors

12

showed immunohistochemically expression of  xxxg1175xxx  alpha and beta
subunits [13]. following the first dose as an intravenous infusion,  xxxd1832xxx  displayed a bi-compartmental behavior with a distribution phase (half-life 2–5 min) and a terminal
phase (half-life 70–80 min) [13]. clearance of the drug was
approximately 1.5–2.0 ml/min/kg with a volume of distribution similar to that of circulating blood (0.06–0.08 l/kg) and
no accumulation between the first and the fifth dose [13]. the
clearance mechanisms were not saturated and the area under
the curve (auc) was proportional to the dose administered
over the dose range tested [9,13,14]. a total of 38% had significant antibody titers to dt or to dab389-il-2 at the time of the
enrollment in the study versus 92% with titers at the end of the
treatment [9,13]. the presence of the antibody did preclude neither clinical response nor adverse events, with the exception of
hypoalbuminemia [9,13].
dosage & administration

the recommended dose of  xxxd1832xxx  is 9 or
18 µg/kg/day intravenous over at least 15 min for 5 consecutive
days every 21 days [15]. the optimal treatment duration has not
been established.  xxxd1832xxx  is supplied as a 150 µg/ml
sterile, frozen solution in a 2-ml single-dose vial and the concentration must be at least 15 µg/ml during all steps of the
intravenous infusion preparation by adding to the calculated
dose of the  xxxd543xxx  ml of 0.9% preservative free sodium
chloride for each 1 ml of the drug in the bag [15]. denileukin
diftitox should be administered within 6 h of preparation and
not in a bolus injection [15].
safety & tolerability

• the safety database of  xxxd1832xxx  is derived from the
early trials based on 143 patients with lymphoma who were
treated in the phase i and iii trials [9,13,16].
• the most frequently reported adverse events included flu-like
symptoms (91%), hypoalbuminemia (83%), acute hypersensitivity-type reactions (69%), asthenia (66%), nausea/
vomiting (64%), hypotension (50%) and infections (48%).
• other less frequent side effects encompass back pain (28%),
dyspnea (28%), vasodilation (28%), rash (25%), chest pain
(24%), tachycardia (12%), dysphagia (5%) and syncope
(3%).
• anaphylaxis (1%) occurred during or within 24 h of  xxxd1832xxx  infusion with 50% of the events occurring during the first dose of the cycle and severe in 2% of the patients.
the occurrence of such an event warrants slowing/stopping of
the infusion rate and intravenous administration of
antihistamines, steroids or epinephrine.
• a vascular leak syndrome occurred in 27% of the patients in
the clinical trials. the syndrome is characterized by the
occurrence of at least two of the symptoms/signs: hypotension, hypoalbuminemia and peripheral edema. the onset of
the symptoms may be delayed up to 2 weeks after the infusion of the drug persisting in some cases or worsening in

others after discontinuation of the drug infusion. although
this adverse event is often self-limited, body weight, blood
pressure,  xxxg124xxx  and edema should be monitored.

• in the phase iii studies, interestingly, all the described side
effects were most severe during the first two cycles of treatment diminishing significantly later. 21% of the patients
required hospitalization for the drug-related adverse events
with only 5% of the reactions severe or life-threatening [17].
• finally, chemical abnormalities were reported beside
hypoalbuminemia. hepatic transaminase levels were abnormally elevated in 61% of the patients with most of the elevations occurring during the first cycle of therapy waning during subsequent cycles. myelotoxicity was not significant,
although the lymphocyte count was transiently fluctuating in
some patients [16,17].
• the initial clinical studies did not allow the premedication
with either dexamethasone or prednisone. when the steroids
were allowed in later studies there was a significant decrease
of the overall adverse events, particularly in the number of
the grade 3/4 hypersensitivity-related events [16,17]. this was
associated with an increased number of patients who were
able to complete therapy without interruption related to
drug toxicity. hence, this translated in an overall increase in
the response rate from 30% in the initial studies to 60% in
the studies when premedication with steroids was
subsequently allowed [18].
clinical trials
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma

an initial phase i multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation trial
with  xxxd1832xxx  included histologically confirmed
relapsed  xxxg2343xxx  together with nhl or hl if their tumors
expressed  xxxg1175xxx  by an immunohistochemical assay for the  xxxg1174xxx 
or the p75 subunit [13]. in this study the  xxxg2343xxx  population
consisted of 35 patients with a mean age of 61.4 years (range,
40–81), prevalently male (69% males vs 31% females), disease
duration of a mean 3.6 years (range, 0.2–12) and a median of
three previous therapies (range, 0–15) [13]. the patients were
distributed in the groups of testing dose of  xxxd1832xxx 
as it follows: eight patients in the 3–9 µg/kg/day group, six in
the 12–15 µg/kg/day-group, eight in the 19 µg/kg/day-group,
nine in the 23–27 µg/kg/day-group, and finally four in the
31 µg/kg/day-group. of the specimen screened 62% of those
with  xxxg2343xxx  expressed one or both of the subunits for  xxxg1175xxx . in
terms of response in the  xxxg2343xxx  group, five patients showed
complete remission (cr) and eight patients partial remission
(pr) with an overall response rate (orr) of 37% (95% confidence interval [ci] with a range 21–53%) [13]. interestingly,
this study showed no correlation between density of the  xxxg1174xxx 
and/or p75 subunit of the  xxxg1175xxx  and response to treatment.
one smaller study confirmed clinical activity of denileukin
diftitox in  xxxg2343xxx  patients [18]. in this study, four patients with
late stage  xxxg2343xxx  (ib-iva) who had failed at least two previous
therapies were treated with  xxxd1832xxx  both at 9 or

www.future-drugs.com

18 µg/kg/day as 15-min intravenous infusion for 5 days every
3 weeks for eight cycles. although the number of the patients
was small, two patients had cr (one stage ib
lasting >11 months from the treatment, one stage iib
lasting >6 months with a complete clearing of a large lesion
lasting >18 months), and two patients experienced pr (one
patient with iib, and one with iva showing 80–99%
reduction in tumor masses lasting 5 months) [18].
the encouraging orr of 37% for the  xxxg2343xxx  patients in the
previous phase i study led to the subsequent phase iii of two
dose levels of  xxxd1832xxx  in the treatment of
 xxxg2343xxx  [13,16]. in this study, patients with biopsy-proven  xxxg2343xxx 
expressing cd25 on 20% or more of lymphocytes were
assigned to one of the two dose levels;  xxxd1832xxx 
9 µg/kg/day (n = 35) or 18 µg/kg/day (n = 36), administered for
5 days every 3 weeks up to eight cycles. the two dose groups
were equally distributed in terms of age (median: 61 years;
range: 36–90), duration of the disease (6 years), race (predominance caucasian vs african–americans and hispanic), gender
(almost equally distributed between male and female vs the male
predominance of the initial phase i study [13]) stage of the disease (40% ≤iia and 60% ≥iib 9 µg/kg/day vs 33% ≤iia and
67% ≥iib 18 µg/kg/day), and number of previous treatments
(median: 5; range: 1–12). a total of 30% of 71  xxxg2343xxx  patients
treated had an overall objective response with 10% cr and
20% pr similar to the previous study (orr: 37%) [13]. the
response rate and the duration of the response as time of the first
dose of the study drug for all the responders (median:
6.9 months; range: 2.7–46.1) were not statistically significant
different between the two dose-groups [16]. this study clearly
established the clinical efficacy of  xxxd1832xxx  as an
important therapeutic agent in the treatment of patients with
 xxxg2343xxx  refractory to previous therapies [16].
more recently, in the attempt of increasing the clinical efficacy of  xxxd1832xxx  in the treatment of  xxxg2343xxx , a phase i
trial of the drug in combination with  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ®,
ligand pharmaceuticals) has been conducted [19].  xxxd330xxx  is
a retinoid x receptor (rxr) selective ligand with clinical activity in patients with early and advanced stage  xxxg2343xxx  [19]. previous in vitro studies had shown that  xxxd330xxx  at concentrations of 10–6 m to 10–8 m was able to upregulate both the  xxxg1174xxx 
and the p75 subunits of the  xxxg1175xxx  and to enhance the cytotoxicty of  xxxd1832xxx  by five- to tenfold in leukemia
cells [20]. hence,  xxxd330xxx -activated rxr forms heterodimers
with partner nuclear receptors. it is hypothesized that these heterodimers may act as transcription factors regulating  xxxg1175xxx 
subunit-expression [20]. a total of 14 patients with relapsed or
refractory  xxxg2343xxx  were treated with escalating doses of  xxxd330xxx  (75 mg/day up to 300 mg/day) and  xxxd1832xxx 
(18 µg/kg/day) daily infusion for 3 days every 21 days in this
phase i trial [20]. orr was 67% with four cr and four pr.
the  xxxg1175xxx  modulation occurred at doses of or above
150 mg/day. the toxicity consisted of grade 2/3 leucopenia in
four patients, and grade 4 leucopenia in two patients. the
authors of the study concluded that the combination of

 xxxd330xxx / xxxd1832xxx  is feasible and that even a low
dose as 150 mg/day of  xxxd330xxx  is capable of upregulating
in vivo the expression of cd25 in circulating leukemia cells [20].

non-hodgkin’s lymphoma

a total of 17 patients with nhl were treated in the initial
phase i multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation trial with  xxxd1832xxx  which included also patients with  xxxg2343xxx  and
hl [13]. since  xxxd1832xxx  showed no clinical efficacy in
hl patients, this disease will not be discussed in this review. the
demographic of the nhl patients consisted of median age of
53.4 years (range, 20–71), 60% males versus 40% females, 3.7
years as mean duration of their disease (range, 0.2–16.1), 6%
stage ii, 36% stage iii, and 59% stage iv, with a median of four
previous therapies (range, 2–10). the nhl patients were distributed in the testing dose group as it follows: three patients in
the 3–9 µg/kg/day-group, eight in the 12–15 µg/kg/day-group,
five
in
the
19 µg/kg/day-group,
one
in
the
23–27 µg/kg/day-group, and none in the 31 µg/kg/day-group.
of the 17 nhl patients, three showed tumor regression defined
as two prs in patients with follicular lymphoma (fl) and one
cr in a patient with diffuse large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl)
who had relapsed less than 100 days since autologous bone marrow transplant (abmt) [13]. the median time to response
(ttr) was 2 months with a median duration of the response
(mdr) of 10 months (range, 2.4–39+). interestingly, the patient
with dlbcl remained in cr at 39+ months at the time of the
publication of the study [13].
subsequently, dang and colleagues assessed the efficacy and
safety of  xxxd1832xxx  in 50 patients with relapsed or
refractory b-cell nhl in a phase ii study [21]. the demographic of the 45 patients assessable for response was as it follows: median age 64 years (range: 32–79), 67% males and 33%
females, with a median of four (range: 1–9) previous treatments. furthermore, all the patients had previously received
treatment with rituximab, 16% of the patients had previously
undergone abmt, and 71% of the patients had chemorefractory disease. the b-cell nhl histology included 47.8%
dlbcl, 17.8% mantle cell lymphoma (mcl), 15.6% small
lymphocytic lymphoma (sll), 13.3% follicular cell lymphoma
(fl), 4.4% transformed large cell and, finally, 2.2% marginalzone lymphoma (mzl). tumor cd25-expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded biopsy specimen or/and by flow cytometry when
possible. for both assays, the positive were defined by 10% or
more tumor cells with detectable cd25.  xxxd1832xxx 
was administered intravenously at a dose of 18 µg/kg/day for
5 days every 3 weeks, up to eight cycles. the orr of 25% consisted of 7% cr and 18% pr with 20% of the patients presenting stable disease (sd). objective response rates were similar with 22% (22% sd) in cd25+ cases versus 29% (18% sd)
in cd25- cases. similarly to previous study, responsive or sd
did not correlate with cd25 expression [13]. in the case of
responding patients, median time to treatment failure was
7 months, with a median follow up of 18 months in survivors

14

(range: 9–28). notably, premedication with corticosteroids was
administered to patients in this study for reducing frequency
and severity of adverse events. similarly to previous studies in
 xxxg2343xxx  patients, corticosteroids improved the tolerability and
decreased the rate of discontinuation of  xxxd1832xxx  due
to adverse events [18,21]. overall, this study showed that  xxxd1832xxx  is effective in relapsed or refractory b-cell nhl
and is well tolerated at the tested dose [21]. more recently, the
same group has conducted a phase ii study of  xxxd1832xxx  for relapsed or refractory t-cell nhl, except for
 xxxg2343xxx  [22]. in this study,  xxxd1832xxx  was administered
intravenously at 18 µg/kg/day with corticosteroid premedication for 5 days every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles. a total of
25 patients were assessable for response at the time of the study
presentation [22]. median age was 55 years (range: 26–80) and
patients had received a mean number of two (range: 1–6) previous treatments. the level of cd25 positivity was defined by
10% or more tumor cells expressing detectable cd25 as
assessed by both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.
there were 30.8% cr and 30.8% pr (orr 61.6%) in 13
patients with cd25+ t-cell lymphoma, whereas 10% cr and
30% pr (orr 40%) were present in ten patients with cd25t-cell lymphoma. two patients had cd25 tumor cells of undetermined status. the orr of the entire population of patients
was 48% (5 cr 20%; 7 pr 28%). the median progression-free survival for responding patients was 6 months
(range, 1–24+). interestingly, one patient with cr and another
with pr went on to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allobmt), while in  xxxd1832xxx -induced remission. most common toxicities seen were transient transaminase
elevation, hypoalbuminemia and edema, with the majority of
toxicity being of grade 1 and 2. furthermore, whereas the
response to the drug was seen in both cd25+ and cd25- t-cell
lymphoma, it seemed that the activity in cd25+ tumors was
more pronounced than the cd25- counterpart [22]. in conclusion this study suggests that single agent  xxxd1832xxx  is
active and well tolerated in the treatment of t-cell nhl.
chronic lymphocytic leukemia

in an initial study, 18 patients with relapsed/refractory cll were
treated with 60-min intravenous infusion of  xxxd1832xxx 
at both 9 µg/kg/day (for patients >70 years or zubrod performance status of 2) and 18 µg/kg/day for 5 days every 21 days up to
eight cycles [23]. the mean age of the patients treated was 61.8
years (range, 52–74) with 14 males and four females. according
to rai staging the patients were distributed two in stage i, six in
stage ii and ten in stage iv, and they had received a mean
number of 4.5 (range, 1–11) previous treatments. tumor
responses were assessed by peripheral blood leukemia cell counts,
computed tomography scan (ct)-measurements of the target
lymph nodes and bone marrow biopsies [23]. 12 patients were valuable for response as they received ≥ three cycles of treatment
with  xxxd1832xxx . a total of 11 of 12 patients showed
reductions of the peripheral leukemia cell counts, with six of 11
showing 95% or greater reductions. seven patients showed

 xxxd1832xxx 

reductions of lymph node diameters by both exam and ct measurement with two of 12 showing 60 and 80% shrinkage, respectively. cll marrow indices (percentage of leukemia × marrow
cellularity) assessed by pre and post-bone marrow biopsy showed
a reduction in 11 patients. seven of 11 patients had greater than
50% reduction, including 98% or greater reduction in three
patients. in this study, the pr was 17% and another 58% of the
patients experienced minimal responses. three patients showed
prolonged progression-free survival with 10 months or more up
to 19+ months. interestingly, the percentage cd25 expression
was 77 ± 12% in the responders versus 53 ± 27% in the nonresponders, with a difference of borderline significance by the twosample t test (p = 0.02). morgan and coworkers reported an
additional seven cll patients treated with  xxxd1832xxx 
demonstrating drug activity in instances of cd25- cases and
highly chemorefractory disease with a chromosome 17p abnormality [24]. six patients were initially treated with 18 µg/kg/day
for 5 days every 3 weeks, while one patient, owing to advanced
age and poor performance status, initially received 9 µg/kg/day
for two courses increasing subsequently to 13.5 µg/kg/day for the
reminder of the treatment. the median age of the treated
patients was 52 (range, 48–73) with five males and two females.
the median of the time from diagnosis was 98 months (range:
46–161), and there were four of seven patients in rai stage iii/iv
at the time of treatment. patients had received a median of six
previous treatments (range: 3–12) and they were able to complete a median of three numbers of cycles (range: 1–10) with
 xxxd1832xxx . two of the seven patients had an objective
partial response with two additional minor responses. interestingly, one of the seven patients harboring the poor prognosis 17p
deletion had a clinically significant hematological response,
becoming platelet transfusion-independent after previously
requiring weekly transfusions. another patient experienced normalization of peripheral lymphocyte count and more than a 90%
reduction in nodal size and conversion from a diffuse bone marrow infiltrate to scattered nodular pattern with normalization of
the hematopoiesis [23]. six of the seven patients showed a significant reduction in peripheral blood lymphocytosis. overall, the
observed responses were durable with one pr lasting 16 months
and another ongoing at 15+ months at the moment of the study
publication.
lilly and colleagues have more recently confirmed in a larger
number of chemorefractory cll patients (16 patients) the
clinical moderate activity of  xxxd1832xxx  (orr 27%,
cr 9% [duration of response 9+ months]; pr 18% [duration
of response 5+ and 7+ months, respectively]) [25]. frankel and
coworkers have recently analyzed the results of two multi-institutional phase ii studies derived from a total of 28 patients
with refractory or  xxxd2120xxx  intolerant or recurrent within
6-month cll (18 in study a + 10 in study b) treated with
 xxxd1832xxx  including 16 patients from a prior study by
lilly and colleagues in the analysis [25,26]. eligibility criteria for
patient entry were similar but not identical, although the treatment protocols were similar with 60-min infusion of
 xxxd1832xxx  at a dose of 18 µg/kg/day for 5 days every

21 days for up to eight cycles. a total of 48% of the patients
expressed cd25 in at least 20% of circulating cll cells
assessed by flow cytometry. the mean patient age was 63 years
with 23 males and five females. six patients had rai stage i
cll, seven patients had rai stage ii, whereas three and
12 patients had rai stage iii/iv, respectively. they had received
a mean of 3.4 of previous treatments (range: 1–7). response
was assessed by peripheral blood cll cell count, lymph node
size measurements and bone marrow biopsy. 12 of 22 patients
reached reduction of peripheral blood cll cell counts, with
five of 12 patients achieving greater than 80% reductions.
overall  xxxd1832xxx  produced a 4% cr and 23% pr
with an orr of 27%. progression-free intervals in the seven
responders ranged from 2 to 12 months. finally, there was no
significant correlation of both response and toxicity with the
numbers of cycles received or with the cd25 level [26].
graft versus host disease

an initial phase i clinical trial of  xxxd1832xxx  was conducted in 30 patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versushost disease (agvhd) [27]. steroid-refractory gvhd is a common complication of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (hsct) that is associated with poor survival
primarily due to infections [27]. the rationale underlying the
study was based on the knowledge that the pathophysiology of
agvhd is in part mediated by activated t cells that are
derived from the donor and are alloreactive versus the recipient.
the activated t cells express the  xxxg1175xxx  whose activation by the
il-2 binding triggers a series of signaling pathways responsible
for the differentiation and the proliferation of the alloreactive
t-cells [28]. ho and coworkers treated seven patients with  xxxd1832xxx  9 µg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15;
18 patients with 9 µg/kg intravenous on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17
and 19; five patients with 9 µg/kg intravenous on days 1–5 and
15–19 [27]. the median age of the patients was 43 years (range:
20–63 years) and the demographic was represented by 15 males
and 15 females, 15 acute leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome
(aml/mds), four chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml), six
cll, three nhl, one hl and one plasma cell leukemia. a
total of 26 patients were matched unrelated-, two matched
related-, one antigen mismatch related- and one antigen mismatch unrelated-donor. a total of 11 patients had grade ii
agvhd, 13 patients had grade iii and six had grade iv
agvhd, respectively. previous gvhd therapies within
3 weeks of enrollment included tacrolimus (23 patients),
cyclosporine (seven patients), sirolimus (eight patients),  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) (16 patients),  xxxd1798xxx 
(12 patients), infliximab (three patients), and extracorporeal
photopheresis (one patient). the median number of previous
immunosuppressive agents was three with a range of two to
six [27]. the increased level of hepatic transaminase was the
dose-limiting toxicity (dlt), and dose level 2 was the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) in this study. of the patients, 50%
had complete resolution and 21% had partial resolution of the
agvhd with an overall response of 71%. some 33% of the

patients were alive at 6.3–24.6 months (median, 7.2 months) at
the moment of the publication of the study [27]. the authors
concluded that  xxxd1832xxx  was tolerable and clinically
activite in steroid-refractory agvhd [27].
subsequently, shaughnessy and colleagues reported a
phase ii study of  xxxd1832xxx  in 22 patients with steroid-refractory agvhd [29]. the median age of the patients was
44 years (range: 9–59) with 12 males and 10 females. the diagnosis of their primary malignancy included eight nhl/hl, six
aml/mds, five cml, two multiple myeloma (mm) and one
aplastic anemia (aa). a total of 12 patients had matched
related-, eight had matched unrelated-, and two had
antigen-mismatched unrelate-donor. seven patients presented
at study entry with grade b, seven with grade c, and eight with
grade d agvhd [29]. 20 patients were treated at dose level 1
(4.5 µg/kg daily on days 1–5 and then weekly on days 8, 15, 22
and 29), and two patients were treated at dose level 2
(9 µg/kg/day at the same schedule). since grade 3/4 renal and
hepatic toxicity and vls were observed at dose level 2, this
refrained from further treating patients at this level, particularly
that level 1 was well tolerated. the response of the agvhd
was assessed at day 36 and 100 with 41% of the patients showing cr at day 36 and an additional 27% response rate (four
cr and two pr) at day 100. this study confirmed tolerability
and efficacy of  xxxd1832xxx  in the treatment of
steroid-refractory agvhd [29].

expert commentary

it is clear that  xxxd1832xxx  has activity against lymphoid-derived malignancies ( xxxg2343xxx , b and t-cell nhl, and
cll) and in the immunomodulation of nonmalignant disease
such as gvhd derived by the dysregulation of  xxxg1175xxx  expressing
alloreactive t cells. although the drug is only indicated for the
treatment of relapsed/refractory  xxxg2343xxx  according to the us
fda-approved label, the spectrum of the indications may change
in the future including a broader spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders. in the next 5 years, considering that the response
rate of the drug is similar to other single agents used in the treatment of lymphomas and cll and that the patients who have
been treated on the studies had received an average of three or
more previous treatments, future studies should address the use
of  xxxd1832xxx  at earlier time of the disease and/or in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. furthermore,
not to underestimate the relevance of improvement of quality of
life in patients treated with  xxxd1832xxx  in measuring the
drug efficacy as underlined in a recent study, future studies need
to address this issue [30].
in conclusion, we suggest devoting further efforts in ameliorating the efficacy of the drug in well defined studies based on collaboration between the industry and investigators, part of which
in terms of current clinical trials can be visualized at the ligand
pharmaceutical website [101] and at the government site of the
national cancer institute [102].

key issues
•  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®) represents historically the first recombinant fusion toxin to be approved for the treatment of a
malignancy setting a new paradigm of biotherapy.
•  xxxd1832xxx  is fda-approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory  xxxg2343xxx  as an intravenous infusion (for at lest 15 min) at
a dose of both 9 or 18 µg/kd/day for 5 days every 21 days.
• the toxicity of the drug is manageable particularly with steroid-premedication. this allows a better control of the severity of the
adverse events (mainly flu-like symptoms, acute infusion-related hypersensitivity and vls) and increases the number of patients
who are able to complete therapy without interruption related to drug toxicity. hence, this translated in an overall increase in the
response rate from 30% in the initial studies to 60% in more recent studies.
•  xxxd1832xxx  has clearly shown activity in patients with b and t-cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute
graft-versus-host disease.
