 xxxd3303xxx : a review of its use in hypertension.   xxxd3303xxx  is an  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonist that is highly selective for type 1  xxxg99xxx  receptors. it was significantly more effective than placebo in large (n >100), double-blind, randomised, multicentre clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.  xxxd3303xxx  20 to 160 mg once daily produced mean reductions in supine trough systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of up to 15.5 and 10.5 mm hg, respectively. maximum blood pressure reduction occurred with a dosage of 40 to 80 mg/day.  xxxd3303xxx  40 to 120 mg/day was as effective as amlodipine 5 to 10 mg/day or atenolol 50 to 100 mg/day in dose-titration studies.  xxxd3303xxx  20 to 160 mg/day was generally similar in efficacy to enalapril 5 to 20 mg/day or lisinopril 10 to 40 mg/day in both titration-to-response and other studies. hydrochlorothiazide was coadministered in most of the titration-to-response studies if patients remained hypertensive.  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg/day was more effective than submaximal dosages of losartan (50 mg/day) or  xxxd3487xxx  (80 mg/day) and was as effective as a fixed-dose combination of losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg over the last 6 hours of the dosage interval and the whole 24-hour postdose interval. in patients with severe hypertension,  xxxd3303xxx  80 to 160 mg/day was as effective as enalapril 20 to 40 mg/day (both agents could be titrated and combined sequentially with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and amlodipine 5 mg). the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to  xxxd3303xxx  was more effective than each agent alone at lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension.  xxxd3303xxx  was well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hypertension and was significantly less likely to cause persistent,  xxxd1861xxx  than lisinopril.
