the biguanides,  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin, are used in the treatment of type ii diabetes mellitus, as well as
being routinely used in studies investigating ampk activity. we used the patch-clamp technique and
rubidium ﬂux assays to determine the role of these drugs in  xxxg1253xxx  (katp) regulation in
cell lines expressing the cloned components of katp and the current natively expressed in vascular smooth
muscle cells (vsmcs).  xxxd2903xxx  but not metformin inhibits a number of variants of katp including the
cloned equivalents of currents present in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle ( xxxg1255xxx /sur2b and
 xxxg1250xxx /sur2b) and pancreatic beta-cells ( xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx ). however it does not inhibit the current potentially
present in cardiac myocytes ( xxxg1250xxx /sur2a). the highest afﬁnity interaction is seen with  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b
(ic50 = 0.55 mm) and it also inhibits the current in native vascular smooth muscle cells. the extent and rate
of inhibition are similar to that seen with the known katp blocker pnu 37883a. additionally,  xxxd2903xxx 
inhibited the current elicited through the kir6.2deltac26 (functional without sur) channel with an ic50 of
1.78 mm.  xxxd2903xxx  reduced the open probability of  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b channels by ∼ 90% in inside-out patches.
these ﬁndings suggest that  xxxd2903xxx  interacts directly with the pore-forming kir6.0 subunit however the
sulphonylurea receptor is able to signiﬁcantly modulate the afﬁnity. it is likely to block from the intracellular
side of the channel in a manner analogous to that of pnu 37883a.

1. introduction
katp channels are present in many cell types and couple cell
metabolism to potassium ﬂux across cell membranes (rodrigo and
standen, 2005). metabolic regulation of katp is mediated via cellular
changes in atp, where increased or decreased atp concentrations
result in inhibition and activation of katp, respectively. in addition,
rising adp as a result of a metabolic challenge such as ischaemia and
hypoxia also activate the channel (rodrigo and standen, 2005).
katp channels are composed of an octameric complex of poreforming subunits ( xxxg1255xxx  or  xxxg1250xxx ), members of the inwardly
rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  family, and the sulphonylurea receptor
subunit ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a and sur2b) who are members of the atpbinding cassette family of proteins (seino, 1999; rodrigo and standen,
2005). co-assembly of a particular kir6 with a particular sur in
different tissues generates currents that have a characteristic
conductance, nucleotide regulation and pharmacology (seino, 1999;
babenko et al., 1998; tucker and ashcroft, 1998). for example,  xxxg1255xxx 
with sur2b is thought to comprise the vascular smooth muscle katp
current (yamada et al., 1997; beech et al., 1993; cui et al., 2002; miki
et al., 2002),  xxxg1250xxx  with sur2b is present in non-vascular smooth

muscle (isomoto et al., 1996),  xxxg1250xxx  with sur2a or  xxxg19xxx  comprise
the cardiac  xxxg1253xxx  (alekseev et al., 2005) and the pancreatic
 xxxg1253xxx  respectively (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995; inagaki et al.,
1995).
oral biguanides and metformin in particular are used in the
treatment of type ii diabetes mellitus.  xxxd2903xxx  was withdrawn
from clinical use in the 1970s as it was associated with fatal lactic
acidosis. they act by sensitising peripheral tissues to insulin and
inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. furthermore, metformin and
 xxxd2903xxx  are used as activators of amp-activated protein kinase
(ampk) and a number of their cellular effects are probably mediated
through this action (zhou et al., 2001). indeed, these drugs are
routinely used to investigate ampk involvement in cell signalling
(hardie, 2008). ampk, a  xxxg1377xxx , coordinates cellular
energy metabolism and atp synthesis/conservation with metabolic
demand to regulate the energy balance within the cell (hardie and
carling, 1997). it is activated by an increased amp:atp ratio and
subsequently acts on various downstream targets (hardie, 2004). it
has been reported that ampk can couple membrane transport with
cellular metabolism by inhibiting some ion transporters such as cystic
ﬁbrosis transmembrane regulator (cftr) and the epithelial sodium
channel in order to promote cell survival (hallows et al., 2003;
woollhead et al., 2005). more recently, the presence of ampk has
been shown to promote surface expression of cardiac katp channels
and to be important during preconditioning of cardiomyocytes
(sukhodub et al., 2007).

as both ampk and katp channels are activated by changing atp
and amp: atp ratios, is it possible that katp is a downstream target of
ampk? in this study we investigate the actions of metformin and
 xxxd2903xxx  on katp channels. we show that  xxxd2903xxx  has a direct
effect on the  xxxg1253xxx  independent of ampk at concentrations
commonly used to study ampk.

with 95% o2/5% co2 additionally containing 0.95 mg/ml papain, 0.2%
fatty acid free bsa, 0.5 mm dtt. the tissue was incubated with
shaking at 37 °c for 50 min before being washed in dissociation
medium alone. isolated cells were ﬁnally triturated using a wide-bore
ﬁre polished pasteur pipette and stored at 4 °c until use.

2. materials and methods

2.5. patch clamping

2.1. chemicals

whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed as previously
described (quinn et al., 2003). capacitance transients and series
resistance in whole-cell recordings was compensated electronically
by using ampliﬁer circuitry (axopatch 200b). data were ﬁltered at
1 khz using the ﬁlter provided with the axopatch 200b (4 pole bessel)
and sampled at 5 khz using a digidata 1440 (axon instruments).
currents were acquired and analysed using pclamp10 (axon instruments). pipette solutions (whole-cell and inside-out) contained
(mm); 107 kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 1 cacl2, 10 egta and 5 hepes, ph 7.2
using koh. for whole-cell recordings the pipette solution was supplemented with 1 mm mgatp and 0.5 mm naudp. in whole-cell
studies the bath solution contained (mm); 140 kcl, 2.6 cacl2, 1.2
mgcl2 and 5 hepes (ph 7.4). whole-cell recordings from mouse aortic
smooth muscle cells were carried out in bath solution containing
(mm); 110 nacl, 5 kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 1.8 cacl2, 15 nahco3, 0.5 kh2po4,
0.5 nah2po4, 10 glucose, 10 hepes (ph 7.2). for perforated patch
experiments the bath solution contained (mm): 140 nacl, 5 kcl, 1.2
mgcl2, 2.6 cacl2, 5 hepes (ph 7.4). a stock solution of  xxxd164xxx 
in dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) was prepared and diluted in a standard pipette solution to give a ﬁnal concentration of 200 mug/ml. for
inside-out recordings the bath solution contained (mm) 140 kcl, 1
mgcl2, 5 egta, 10 hepes (ph 7.2). pipette resistances were between 2
and 4 momega for whole-cell recordings and 5–8 momega for single-channel
recordings. agents were applied to the bath using a gravity-driven
system. single-channel open probability (npo) was determined using
clampﬁt 10.0.

all chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich (poole, uk)
except levcromakalin (tocris, uk).
2.2. cell culture
human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells stably transfected with
 xxxg1255xxx /sur2b,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b,  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  were
maintained in  xxxg418xxx  and zeocin selective media as previously
described (cui et al., 2001; giblin et al., 1999). transfection of
kir6.2deltac26 was carried out using fugene hd (roche diagnostics,
uk) as per the manufacturers' instructions. gfp (100 ng) was cotransfected to enable transfection success and efﬁciency to be assessed
and cells were patched 48 h after transfection.
2.3. rubidium ﬂux
a 86rb+ assay was used to determine amount of ﬂux passing
through the katp channels in response to various drugs as previously
described (muzyamba et al., 2007; farzaneh and tinker, 2008). the
cells (in 6-well dishes) were incubated for 24 h with 86rbcl
(0.037 mbq/ml) before being washed three times with hbs assay
medium (10 mm hepes, ph 7.4, 10 mm glucose, 130 mm nacl, 7 mm
kcl, 2 mm cacl2 and 1 mm mgcl2). cells were then pre-incubated with
2 ml of hbs ± 10 mm  xxxd2903xxx  or metformin (concentration
commonly used to activate ampk) for 30 min at 25 °c before channel
activators/inhibitors were added as follows (dmso, 10 mum levcromakalin, 10 mum levcromakalim + 10 mum  xxxd2215xxx ). after a further
15 minute incubation at 25 °c, the supernatant was aspirated into vials
and the cells were lysed using hbs + 2% triton solution and collected.
all vials were assayed for 86rb content by measurement of cherenkov
radiation in a liquid scintillation counter (tricarb, packard 2000ca).
efﬂux was expressed as a percentage relative to the total amount of
radioactivity incorporated. one-way anova followed by a bonferroni
test was use to determine statistical signiﬁcance as indicated in the
text.
2.4. isolation of aortic smooth muscle cells
mouse aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from c57bl/6
male or female mice that were 6 to 8 weeks old. the animals were
allowed free access to standard chow and water ad libitum. the
animals were housed in a 12 hour light–dark cycle in a temperature
controlled environment (21 °c). the work conforms with the guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us
national institutes of health (nih publication no. 85-23, revised
1996). all procedures were approved by the ucl animal ethics
committee and performed in accordance with british home ofﬁce
regulations and guidance (project licence ppl\6732). mice were killed
by isoﬂurane anaesthesia. the aorta was isolated and cleaned of fat
and connective tissue and placed in phosphate buffered saline (pbs)
solution. the lumen was cut through and the endothelium removed.
endothelium denuded whole tissue was placed in a sterile low
calcium dissociation medium (containing 110 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl,
0.16 mm cacl2, 2 mm mgcl2, 10 mm nahco3, 0.5 mm kh2po4,
0.5 mm nah2po4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm hepes, 0.49 mm edta,

2.6. data analysis
concentration–response curves were analysed and ﬁtted using the
sigmoidal ﬁtting function in origin version 6. this function allows the
calculation of the drug concentration at which half-maximal inhibition (ic50) takes place according to the following eq. (1) when the xaxis is set to a logarithmic scale:
i
a1 −a2
=
+ a2
iglib
1 + ðx =ic50 þk

ð1þ

where i/iglib is the inhibitory effect measured relative to the
 xxxd2215xxx -sensitive current at −50 mv, x is the drug concentration, a1 is the initial y value, a2 is the ﬁnal y value and k is the slope
factor.
to analyse the rate of current inhibition, time-course data was also
ﬁtted using the equation (in origin 6).
inhibition =

a1 −a2
+ a2
1 + eðx−x0 þ = k

ð2þ

where x is the time at any given point, x0 is the time at no inhibition
and k is the time constant. other parameters are as described for
eq. (1).
statistical analysis was carried out using one-way anova with a
bonferroni post-hoc test or a paired student's t-test as appropriate.
statistical signiﬁcance is indicated in the ﬁgure legends. data are
presented as mean ± s.e.m. where appropriate, current density is
presented normalised to the control.

3. results
3.1. effects of  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin on katp current
initially, we were interested in exploring the role of ampk in the
regulation of katp channels.  xxxd2903xxx  and metformin have been
shown to result in the activation of ampk and we used them in an
86
rb ﬂux assay where we could monitor the passage of rb through the
channels as a potassium surrogate in response to various activators or
inhibitors. initially, we used hek 293 cells that were stably transfected
with different kir6.0 and sur subunits. during metabolic poisoning
we noticed that pre-application of  xxxd2903xxx  considerably reduced
the ﬂux compared to control (not shown). in order to remove the
complication of potential changes in cellular nucleotides with
metabolic poisoning we activated the channel directly with a speciﬁc
 xxxg1232xxx  opener (kco), levcromakalim. under these
conditions,  xxxd2903xxx  (18.19 ± 0.57%, n = 9, p b 0.001) but not metformin (27.11 ± 1.47%, n = 9, p n 0.05) inhibited ﬂux activated by
10 µm levcromakalim (28.36 ± 0.43%) to control levels (17.81 ±
0.46%) in the  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b cell line (fig. 1a). however,  xxxd2903xxx 
(83.4 ± 2.77% compared to 81.42 ± 0.75 with levcromakalim, n = 9,
p n 0.05) did not inhibit the ﬂux via  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b in this assay (fig. 1b,
but see below). in both cell lines, 10 µm  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited
levcromakalim-activated ﬂux to basal levels (n = 9, p b 0.001). next it
was investigated whether or not analogous effects were also observed
in intact cells using the perforated patch-clamp technique. current was
elicited by a repetitive 1 s voltage ramp from −150 mv to +50 mv
every 15 s. fig. 2 shows that the application of 10 mm metformin did not
induce a signiﬁcant inhibition of the levcromakalim-activated current
(at +50 mv, control: 69.52 ± 7.9; levcromakalim: 173.49 ± 24.76;
metformin: 166.74 ± 30.59 pa/pf, n = 8, p b 0.05 when compared to
control). however, the subsequent perfusion of 10 mm  xxxd2903xxx 
reduced current to control levels (75.28 ± 18.43 pa/pf, n = 8, p n 0.05
compared to control) (fig. 2a and b). 10 µm  xxxd2215xxx  reduced
levcromakalim-activated current to 55.48 ± 8.53 pa/pf (n = 8, p n 0.05
compared to control). this suggests that the biguanides, metformin and
 xxxd2903xxx  are acting differentially on the  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b channel. the
inhibition induced by  xxxd2903xxx  did not show prominent voltagedependence as shown by the voltage ramp traces in fig. 2c.

3.2. effects of  xxxd2903xxx  on other  xxxg1253xxx  subtypes
the standard whole-cell patch-clamp conﬁguration was used to
investigate whether the observed effect of  xxxd2903xxx  on the  xxxg1255xxx /
sur2b channel was the same with different kir6.0 and different sur
subunits (fig. 3). whole-cell recordings for  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b (fig. 3a and b)
and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  (fig. 3e and f) show that in the presence of a potassium
channel opener such as pinacidil or  xxxd1868xxx , application of  xxxd2903xxx  results in current inhibition. however, data in fig. 3c and d show
that  xxxd2903xxx  has no effect on  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a currents (at −60 mv,
control: −29.15± 3.74; 10 µm pinacidil: −192.05 ± 26.66; 10 mm
 xxxd2903xxx : −210.77 ± 23.03; 10 µm  xxxd2215xxx : −54.44 ± 12.16,
n = 10, p b 0.005 compared to control). comparison of the extent of
inhibition by  xxxd2903xxx  of the kco-evoked current through the
different kir6/sur combinations (fig. 4a) showed that the different
channels were inhibited to varying degrees.  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b was inhibited
by 97± 2.0% whereas  xxxg1250xxx /sur2a shows little inhibition in the
presence of  xxxd2903xxx  (1.8± 9.3%).  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx 
are inhibited by 59.9± 8.5% and 67.6 ± 9.5%, respectively. the ﬂux data
did not show an inhibitory effect of  xxxd2903xxx  on  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b
however our experience with this assay is that it is not as sensitive as the
patch-clamp technique and is more variable in reporting intermediate
effects.
dose–response curves for  xxxd2903xxx  using the different kir6/sur
combinations show that the ic50 for  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b is 550 mum whereas
the ic50 for  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  is 9.33 mm. interestingly, when these
experiments were repeated using a  xxxg1250xxx  c-terminal truncation
mutant (kir6.2deltac26) which allows for the  xxxg1250xxx  subunit to be
functionally expressed at the membrane in the absence of surs
(tucker et al., 1997),  xxxd2903xxx  inhibition was clearly observed. the

ic50 of this inhibition was 1.78 mm, in between that of  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b
and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  (fig. 4b). furthermore, the rates of inhibition of
kir6.2deltac26 (0.53 ± 0.11 min) and  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b (0.71 ± 0.15 min)
current by  xxxd2903xxx  are comparable (fig. 4d). conversely, the
rates of inhibition of  xxxg1250xxx /sur2b and  xxxg1250xxx / xxxg19xxx  were slower at
3.12 ± 0.63 min and 1.18 ± 0.21 min, respectively (fig. 4c and d). this
indicates that  xxxd2903xxx  can act directly on the kir6 subunit and that
the sur subunits may modulate its' afﬁnity for the pore-forming
subunit.
3.3.  xxxd2903xxx  acts on the pore-forming kir6 subunit

were directly compared. whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from
hek293 cells stably transfected with  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b showed that the
percentage inhibition of levcromakalim-activated current observed
with pnu 37883a (81.89 ± 3.32%) and  xxxd2903xxx  (95.91 ± 2.51%) is
similar at the concentration used (fig. 5a and b). in addition, there is
no signiﬁcant difference in the rate of inhibition between pnu 37883a
and  xxxd2903xxx  (0.57 ± 0.16 min and 0.71 ± 0.15 min respectively,
n = 8, p n 0.05) (fig. 5c). this indicates that  xxxd2903xxx  can act as

quickly as the pore blocker pnu 37883a to inhibit the  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b
channel. it is thought that pnu 37883a acts from the cytoplasmic side
of the membrane and some of the delay is due to the drug crossing the
membrane.
3.4. inhibition of the native vsm katp current by  xxxd2903xxx 
is this effect of  xxxd2903xxx  unique to the stable lines or is a similar
phenomenon observed using native mouse aortic smooth muscle cells
that are thought to contain  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b? in supplementary data we
show a brief characterisation of these cells. fig. 6a shows a representative time-course plot of a whole-cell recording (taken at
+20 mv from holding potential of −80 mv) from a typical vsmc
from mouse aorta. representative current traces are shown on the left
hand panel. currents were activated by levcromakalim and subsequently inhibited by 10 mm  xxxd2903xxx  past basal levels. the mean
current–voltage relationship in fig. 6b showed that the channel is
inhibited in the presence of both  xxxd2903xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  and
that this block is not voltage-dependent. at +20 mv the mean
current density is signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of  xxxd2903xxx 
(with levcromakalim), 3.45 ± 0.38 pa/pf, compared to that observed

in the presence of levcromakalim alone, 18.3 ± 3.18 pa/pf (n = 6,
p b 0.001) (fig. 6c). comparison of the effects of pnu 37883a and
 xxxd2903xxx  showed that both inhibited the native channel to a
similar extent (fig. 6d and e). the percentage inhibition observed
with pnu 37883a was 71.1 ± 2.5% compared to 69.7 ± 5.6% with
 xxxd2903xxx  (n = 6, p n 0.05). furthermore, the rates of inhibition were
also comparable at 0.32 ± 0.15 min for pnu 37883a and 0.39 ±
0.02 min for  xxxd2903xxx  (n = 6, p n 0.05). thus, it is likely that
 xxxd2903xxx  is having a direct effect on the  xxxg1253xxx  in both the
stably transfected cell lines and in the native aortic smooth muscle cell
where it is thought to consist of  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b.
3.5.  xxxd2903xxx  inhibition of  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b in inside-out patches
it is thought that pnu 37883a acts as a pore blocker at the cytoplasmic face of the channel and this accounts for the kinetics of
inhibition (kovalev et al., 2004). we directly tested whether this might
be the case for  xxxd2903xxx  by pulling inside-out patches in hek293
cells expressing  xxxg1255xxx \sur2b. the application of  xxxd2903xxx  to the
cytoplasmic face of the channel led to prominent inhibition of singlechannel current (fig. 7a). the single-channel current amplitude was
not affected at −60 mv (1.95 ± 0.09 pa in udp versus 1.88 ± 0.08 pa
in udp +  xxxd2903xxx , n = 4, p n 0.05) and inhibition occurred through
an apparent reduction in npo (0.5 ± 0.04 in udp compared with 0.05 ±
0.04 in udp +  xxxd2903xxx , n = 4, p b 0.0001) (fig. 7b).
4. discussion
4.1. inhibition of katp by  xxxd2903xxx  but not metformin
the activation of ampk by the biguanides, metformin and
 xxxd2903xxx  has been shown to occur as a result of an increase in the
cytosolic amp concentration (zhang et al., 2007). both of these drugs are
thought to act by inhibiting complex i of the respiratory chain in
mitochondria that subsequently causes the amp levels within the cell to
increase (owen et al., 2000; el mir et al., 2000). these drugs are
commonly used to implicate ampk signalling in cell signalling and ion

transport processes. it has previously been reported for example that
the chloride channel cftr and the sodium channel enac, are directly
regulated by ampk (hallows et al., 2003; woollhead et al., 2005).
 xxxd2903xxx  itself has been identiﬁed as an inhibitor of ion transport
processes (saito and yoshida, 1984). however our data support a direct
effect of  xxxd2903xxx  on katp channels independent of its action on
ampk. speciﬁcally, the discrepancy in the effects of metformin and
 xxxd2903xxx  at concentrations where they are known to maximally
activate ampk, the relatively rapid effect and the presence of inhibition
under whole-cell conditions in which the nucleotide conditions are
buffered are highly suggestive. however, most clearly the inhibitory
effect on the current is still present in inside-out patches which are
devoid of mitochondria.
4.2. possible mechanism of action by which  xxxd2903xxx  inhibits katp
our favoured hypothesis is that  xxxd2903xxx  is a pore blocker that
partitions into its blocking site either from the membrane or from the
cytoplasm. the clear cut block of the truncated  xxxg1250xxx  channel, which
is missing the last 26 amino acids and can be expressed at the cell
membrane as a functional channel, suggests that  xxxd2903xxx  is able to
interact with the pore (tucker et al., 1997). the comparable kinetics
and magnitude of effect when comparing pnu 37783a, which is
thought to act in this fashion, and  xxxd2903xxx  is also supportive.
however sur can clearly have a modulatory effect, the presence of
sur2a prevents the inhibition of the channel whereas the presence of
sur2b and  xxxg19xxx  allow the channel to be inhibited but to different
extents. indeed, we have seen similar phenomena when examining
pnu 37883a (cui et al., 2003). the highest afﬁnity block was for the
 xxxg1255xxx /sur2b complex (ic50 is 550 mum) the molecular correlate of the
vascular smooth muscle  xxxg1253xxx  (miki et al., 2002; cui et al.,
2002). we also saw that  xxxd2903xxx  could block the native current in
aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. we haven't examined the
biophysical mechanism in extensive detail but the block appeared
to be voltage independent suggesting a blocking site at the periphery
of the conduction pathway and it did not reduce the single-channel
current amplitude. it appeared to have an apparent effect on channel
gating whether through the generation of a blocked single-channel
state or through stabilisation of a true closed gating state. it has been
demonstrated that pnu 37883a interacts with an 81 amino acid
region on the c-terminus of the  xxxg1255xxx  subunit (teramoto, 2006).
however the site of potential interaction with  xxxd2903xxx  is
unknown but it could act in a similar region.
generally in cell signalling studies metformin and  xxxd2903xxx  are
used in the 1–10 mm range. at these concentrations  xxxg1255xxx \sur2b
would be signiﬁcantly inhibited. in contrast therapeutic concentrations in patients are in the low mum range (dell'aglio et al., 2009; schulz
and schmoldt, 2003). it may be that the biguanides partition into
target tissues to achieve higher local concentrations in-vivo if they are
acting via ampk activation.  xxxd2903xxx  is highly lipophilic and has
previously been shown to alter the ﬂuidity and the surface charge of
phospholipid membranes (schafer, 1976). other known ampk
activators and inhibitors have also been shown to be acting through
ampk independent mechanisms. for example, metformin has been
proposed to act via an ampk independent pathway in other cell types
including liver and heart (hawley et al., 2002; bergheim et al., 2006;
saeedi et al., 2008). in rat hearts it was proposed that metformin
action may be mediated by p38 mapk- and pkc-dependent mechanisms (saeedi et al., 2008).
a comparison of the structures shows (fig. 8) that  xxxd2903xxx  and
metformin differ as the names indicate by the presence of a phenyl
group. it is interesting that  xxxd2215xxx  contains such a group
attached to the sulphonyl group.  xxxd3394xxx  is even simpler with a
simple single phenyl group (not shown) and it is known that these
sulphonylureas can interact with the pore as well as the sur subunit
(gribble et al., 1997). practically, the pharmacology of related

biguanides (and synthetic derivatives) may well be worth reinvestigating in an effort to develop a compound that can both selectively inhibit
katp channels and activate ampk promoting both insulin release from
pancreatic beta-cells and sensitisation to the action of the hormone
peripherally. the lack of an effect on the cardiac channel would also be
beneﬁcial.
4.3. conclusions
in conclusion,  xxxd2903xxx  has been shown to inhibit katp channels
to varying extents depending on the complex composition with its
action on  xxxg1255xxx /sur2b being the most potent. this is also reﬂected in
native aortic smooth muscle cells that are proposed to contain  xxxg1255xxx /
sur2b. it appears to act on the pore but the sur subunit plays a
modulatory role in determining the extent and afﬁnity of inhibition.
these effects occur at  xxxd2903xxx  concentrations commonly used in
cell signalling studies.
