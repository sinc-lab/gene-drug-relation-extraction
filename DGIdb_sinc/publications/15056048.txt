combination therapy

 xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ®, ligand pharmaceuticals inc.) is a synthetic retinoid analog with
specific affinity for the retinoid x receptor and belongs to a group of compounds called
rexinoids. early clinical trials of this drug demonstrated activity in cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma. subsequent phase ii/iii trials have demonstrated a greater than 50% response
rate in patients with all stages of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma who were refractory or
intolerant to the previous therapy. the principal toxicities of  xxxd330xxx  include central
hypothyroidism, xeroderma and elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides. these toxicities
can be managed with dose attenuation or addition of atorvastatin (lipitor®, pfizer) or
 xxxd2096xxx  (tricor™, abbott laboratories). since  xxxd330xxx  has little bone marrow
toxicity, it is an excellent candidate for combination therapy with other modalities useful in
the treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma. these include ultraviolet b irradiation,
psoralen and ultraviolet a photochemotherapy, interferons,  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®,
ligand pharmaceuticals inc.) and cytotoxic chemotherapy.  xxxd330xxx  has also been
investigated in the treatment of breast cancer and non-small cell carcinoma of the lung
with promising early results.

future prospects

 xxxd2071xxx  play an important role in cell
physiology. they are essential for embryonic
development, regulating organogenesis, organ
homeostasis and cell growth [1]. these compounds bind to and activate one or more
nuclear retinoid receptors to modulate gene
expression. there are two known classes of
retinoid receptors,  xxxd3417xxx  receptors
(rars) and retinoid x receptors (rxrs).
within each class there are three subtypes: alpha, beta
and gamma. rar can homodimerize or heterodimerize with rxr to affect differentiation and
cell growth, while rxr can form heterodimers
with other nuclear hormone receptors and
modulate a wide variety of cellular functions.
rxr is unique among the nuclear hormone
receptors (rar,  xxxg2412xxx , thyroid
 xxxg1603xxx  and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor) in that it can dimerize with
any of the other nuclear hormone receptors.
when this occurs, the heterodimer binds
dna and affects the function of genes downstream of  xxxd3417xxx  response elements
(rares). it may also function to inhibit

transcription factors or compete with them
for coactivator molecules [2–5].
in keeping with their ability to induce cell
growth, differentiation and apoptosis, retinoic
acids have been studied and used as antitumor or tumor preventive agents. several
retinoid acids are currently approved by the
us food and drug administration (fda)
for the treatment of certain malignancies, or
are in clinical trials to assess their activities in
various tumors. among the retinoids, alltrans  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) has received great
attention in the treatment of acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl) [6,7]. this drug has permitted an understanding about the molecular
function of the fusion proteins and the events
that contribute to the differentiation and
apoptosis of apl cells. the other retinoids,
9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  and 13-cis  xxxd3417xxx ,
have been assessed in early clinical trials and
show some tumor activity in various malignancies such as breast, renal cell, skin cancer,
kaposi’s sarcoma, neuroblastoma and non-small
cell lung cancer (nsclc) [8].

 xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ®, ligand pharmaceuticals inc.;
 xxxd330xxx ) is a new class of  xxxd3417xxx . it is referred to as a
rexinoid as it is the first rxr-selective retinoid agonist to be
studied in humans. it has been approved in the usa for the
treatment of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ) in patients
who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy. this
article will review the early phase i trials and discuss the findings
of phase ii/iii trials. there are also some data showing the
potential use of  xxxd330xxx  in combination with other currently
available treatment modalities for  xxxg2343xxx . finally,  xxxd330xxx 
has been assessed for potential use in solid tumors.

 xxxd444xxx , psoralens plus ultraviolet (puva) and radiation
chemotherapy. systemic therapy includes chemotherapy and
other cytotoxic agents, interferon (ifn), photopheresis, retinoids and investigational new drugs. despite the various treatment options, no studies have shown superiority of any treatment [16]. in fact, in the 1980s, a randomized national cancer
institute (nci) study demonstrated that using a multidrug
regimen to treat  xxxg2343xxx  was equivalent to using sequential conservative topical therapy in prolonging overall survival [17]. the
therapy used varies upon physician–patient preference, with a
goal to achieve symptom control and cosmetic improvement.

cutaneous t-cell lymphoma: a brief review

pharmacology

 xxxg2343xxx  presents with skin lesions and is considered as an indolent, extranodal non-hodgkin’s t-cell lymphoma. subtypes of
 xxxg2343xxx  include  xxxg2302xxx + anaplastic large cell lymphoma and lymphomatoid papulosis, indolent human t-cell lymphotrophic
virus-1-associated t-cell lymphoma, and nonepidermotropic
peripheral t and t-like natural killer lymphomas presenting as
subcutaneous, panniculitic or angiocentric lesions [9,10]. the
most common and indolent form of  xxxg2343xxx  is mycosis fungoides
(mf), with an incidence of 0.37 per 100,000 people [11]. mf
may evolve from pre-existing nonspecific eczematous patches,
follicular papules or exfoliative erythroderma that has been
present for years before a biopsy is performed. the histology of
mf is similar to that of other inflammatory dermatoses. diagnostically, single-cell epidermatropism of lymphocytes along
the basement membrane are more commonly noted than the
typical intraepithelial collections called pautrier’s microabscesses [12]. it is hypothesized that the initiating factor in
developing this clonal expansion arises from persistent superantigen stimulation by skin flora or other unidentified antigen.
due to the inflammatory response, cytokines (interleukin
[il]-2, -7, -8 and  xxxg2296xxx  [tnf]) and chemokines are secreted that stimulate t-cell proliferation and recruit
t-cells to the epidermis [13,14]. the mechanism leading to the
malignant transformation of inflammatory cells remains unclear.
the prognosis and long-term survival of  xxxg2343xxx  patients
depends on the stage at presentation. patients with stage ia
(t1, patches and/or plaques involving less then 10% of body
surface area [bsa], with no palpable lymph nodes) have a
median survival equivalent to age-matched control subjects. in
patients with stage ib (t2, patches and/or plaque involving at
least 10% bsa, no lymphadenopathy) and stage iia (clinically
abnormal lymph nodes), the median survival is approximately
67% or greater  xxxd1891xxx  years when compared with matched control. the median survival diminishes to 5 years in patients with
stage iib (t3, cutaneous tumors) to stage iii (t4, generalized
erythroderma), and 2.5 years in patients with stage iv (pathologically involved lymph nodes or visceral involvement) disease.
large cell transformation within 2 years of diagnosis also
portends a poor prognosis [15].
the treatment for  xxxg2343xxx  can be divided into two categories:
skin-directed and systemic therapy. skin-directed treatments
include topical chemotherapy such as nitrogen mustard and

rexinoids affect tumor cells by suppressing proliferation,
inducing terminal differentiation and promoting apoptosis.
these effects were shown in treated human liposarcoma and
colon carcinoma cells that began expressing markers of differentiation [18]. suppression of proliferation and induction of
apoptosis were also noted in several mouse models studying
mammary and prostate tumors [19]. the antitumor effects of
rexinoids may be mediated by rxr heterodimers formed with
rar and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar).
the rxr–ppar heterodimer in  xxxg2343xxx  blocks activated t-cell
proliferation and secretion of il-2 by inhibiting nuclear factors
that act as transcription factors to control il-2 and other
cytokines. this inhibition prevents the proliferation of the
 xxxg2343xxx  clone and the resulting immune dysfunction [20].
another mechanism, proposed by zhang and colleagues, is the
induction of apoptosis of  xxxg2343xxx  cells. in vitro models using
 xxxg2343xxx  cell lines treated with  xxxd330xxx  showed a decrease in
the expression of the protein survivin, activation of  xxxg341xxx 
and cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase [21]. these
molecular effects have important implications for understanding
how  xxxd330xxx  therapy affects  xxxg2343xxx  in patients, but more
studies are required to clarify the molecular details.
there are other functions of the rxr–ppar heterodimer
that may help explain its role in  xxxg2343xxx . with the activation of
the heterodimer using a ppar agonist, various adhesion molecules of the vasculature and endothelium are downregulated.
these adhesion molecules function as receptors for ligands on
the surface of leukocytes that help recruit and export leukocytes
to areas of inflammation. among the receptors that are inhibited
in its expression on endothelial cells is  xxxg2048xxx  [22]. these are
the receptors for the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (cla),
expressed on  xxxg2343xxx  cells and other skin-homing t-cells.  xxxg2048xxx  is required for  xxxg2343xxx  to gain access to the skin and this
mechanism is of particular interest with regards to how  xxxd330xxx  affects  xxxg2343xxx . often, as there is cutaneous clearing of the
lesions, peripheral blood involvement is usually not affected.
one explanation for this paradox is the entrapment of  xxxg2343xxx 
cells within the vasculature as  xxxg2048xxx  expression is downregulated denying cutaneous homing t-cell access to the skin.
another function of the rxr–ppar heterodimer is its effect in
keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation [23,24]. experiments
have shown that the activation of the receptor with a ppar

181

expert rev. anticancer ther. 4(2), (2004)

 xxxd330xxx 

agonist modulates proliferation and decreases epidermal hyperplasia, normalizes skin pattern proliferation and allows expression of normal protein on cell surfaces. because ppar and rexinoids both activate the same heterodimer, the use of  xxxd330xxx 
could have similar effects on the skin.
clinical trials
safety & tolerability

to evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd330xxx  in solid tumors, phase i
trials were performed in patients with advanced cancer. rizvi
and colleagues looked at 60 patients with advanced cancer, and
assessed safety and tolerability in an open-label, multiple-dose
and dose-escalation phase i trial [25]. with the exception of one
patient having non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, the remainder of the
study group had epithelial solid tumors with confirmed
advanced cancer that had failed standard therapy. the dose
ranged from 5000 to 1000 mg/m2/day. the most common
toxicity was dose-dependent skin toxicity, with the majority
being mild skin dryness. only one experienced skin dryness
and peeling that was dose limiting at 650 mg/m2/day. other
mild (grade i/ii) toxicities noted were headaches (13 out of 60
patients), leukopenia (ten out of 60 patients), elevated transaminases (five out of 60 patients) and prolonged prothrombin
time (four out of 60 patients). two developed grade iii leukopenia that occurred at 800 mg/m2/day. another developed
grade iii elevation of  xxxg941xxx  and aspartate
aminotransferase that occurred at 1000 mg/m2/day. in this particular study, the dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) was determined
to be 500 mg/m2/day, however, in another phase i trial by
miller and colleagues, the dlt was 300 mg/m2/day [26].
two metabolic alterations that were noted in most patients
were the development of hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism. hypertriglyceridemia usually developed 1 to 2 weeks
after taking  xxxd330xxx  and its severity was dose related. the
triglyceride level was usually controlled with the administration
of  xxxd2096xxx  (tricor™, abbott laboratories) or atorvastatin
(lipitor®, pfizer). however, in the initial studies, the drug gemfibrozil ( xxxd2189xxx ®, bayer) was used but patients were noted to
have worsening triglyceride levels. later, pharmokinetic studies
revealed that gemfibrozil increased the plasma level of  xxxd330xxx . the mechanism by which  xxxd330xxx  induces hypertriglyceridemia is believed to involve alteration of ppar regulation. ppar is known to control genes implicated in
intracellular and extracellular lipid metabolism. in addition,
rexinoids are also known to increase transcription of apolipoprotein c-iii. when elevated, this protein inhibits unloading
of lipids from very low-density lipoproteins into cells, thus
causing accumulation of triglycerides in the plasma [27,28].
the mechanism by which  xxxd330xxx  causes hypothyroidism
is unclear. sherman and colleagues evaluated 27 patients with
 xxxg2343xxx  on  xxxd330xxx  therapy and showed a decline in the  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) level while on treatment [29].
the level of tsh decline was proportional to the dose of  xxxd330xxx  used, and 19 patients reported signs and symptoms of
hypothyroidism that were not present at the onset of treatment.

www.future-drugs.com

for patients who were continually monitored following the discontinuation of  xxxd330xxx , most attained normal baseline
levels of tsh with resolution of hypothyroid symptoms. a
recent mouse model developed by liu and colleagues showed a
potential mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs [30].
rats were treated with an rxr agonist ( xxxd1077xxx ) and the
kinetics of rexinoid effects on the thyroid axis were studied.
there was a notable decrease in tsh within 30 min of administration that became statistically significant within 2 h. by 24 h,
the tsh levels partially recovered. conversely, thyroid hormone
(t3 and t4) levels were not affected several hours after administration, but were noted to be lower by 24 h. the decrease in
thyroid hormones was likely a direct affect from the decrease in
tsh level. measuring the pituitary tshbeta messenger rna
(mrna) and the total tsh protein assessed the decrease in the
tsh level. surprisingly, there were no changes in the level,
which led to the conclusion that  xxxd330xxx  potentially blunted
the thyroid releasing hormone-stimulated tsh secretion. furthermore, it is likely that rxrgamma mediates this alteration as
rxrgamma-null mice were shown to have elevated tsh levels. this
finding indicates an inhibitory role for rxrgamma in the regulation
of thyroid axis hormones.
efficacy

having determined the common toxicities associated with oral
 xxxd330xxx , several phase ii/iii trials were performed looking at
response rates in patients with refractory or persistent  xxxg2343xxx .
because combination chemoradiotherapy offered no survival
benefit over conservative chemotherapy, newer biologic therapies such as retinoids are currently being studied. among such
studies, those by prince and coworkers are included, where
eight patients with previously treated and refractory  xxxg2343xxx 
were entered into a phase ii international multicenter study [31].
patients were entered into three arms based on the stage of the
disease. patients with stage i–iia were randomized to receive
 xxxd330xxx  capsules at 6.5 mg/m2 or 300 mg/m2 or  xxxd330xxx 
1% gel. those patients with more advanced disease
(stage iib–iv) were given doses of 300 mg/m2. of the eight
patients, seven received oral formulations, while only one
received the topical gel. one patient who was randomized to
commence at the lower dose of  xxxd330xxx  (6.5 mg/m2/day)
had disease progression on day 78 and was crossed over to the
high-dose therapy. this patient subsequently achieved 95%
clearing by the physician’s global assessment of clinical condition (pga) standard. of the seven patients receiving the oral
administration, five (71%) achieved a partial response (pr),
with mean time of response at 27 days. three of the five
relapsed while on  xxxd330xxx , with mean time of relapse of
92 days. the single patient who received the topical formulation
remains in pr at 31 months at the time of the article’s publication. of the toxicities noted, hypertriglyceridemia was the most
prevalent and was seen within 2 weeks of administration. levels
were controlled with atorvastatin. other grade 2/3 toxicities
reported by patients include diarrhea, headache, pruritis,
edema and treatment emergent reduction of tsh level.

in another phase ii/iii clinical trial, duvic and colleagues
enrolled 58 patients with biopsy-proven stage ia–iia  xxxg2343xxx 
and determined the safety and efficacy of oral  xxxd330xxx  [32].
patients enrolled were refractory to therapy or had reached at
least a 6-month response plateau under at least two forms of
prior therapy. two randomized doses of 6.5 mg/m2/day (with
cross over at progression) versus 650 mg/m2/day were evaluated
in an open-label, multicenter study performed between february
1997 and february 1998. the higher dose was later modified
to 300 mg/m2/day based on response and dlt effects. overall
response rates (pr + combined complete response [ccr]) were
noted in 20% of patients (three out of 15), 54% of patients (15
out of 28) and 67% of patients (ten out of 15) randomized to
receive doses of 6.5, 300 and greater than 300 mg/m2/day,
respectively. for patients starting at the lowest dose, 11 of 15
subsequently crossed over to the higher dose and 73% of
patients (eight out of 11) subsequently responded. the median
time to onset of response (defined as at least 50% improvement) was 8.1 weeks at 300 mg/m2/day versus 13.1 weeks at
higher doses (>300 mg/m2/day) where there were pauses in
therapy due to toxicities. the median time to progression was 13.6
versus 30.0 weeks at 6.5 mg/m2/day versus 300 mg/m2/day,
respectively, and 73.7 weeks at above 300 mg/m2/day.
during the clinical trial, or within 4 weeks of discontinuing
therapy, there were no reported deaths. however, there were
three cases of pancreatitis reported due to high levels of triglycerides (>1300 mg/dl). of note, these three patients had a prior
history of hypertriglyceridemia and alcohol consumption,
which stresses the importance of screening patients for their
alcohol intake prior to starting  xxxd330xxx . all patients recovered
and no further report of pancreatitis occurred after institution
of a lipid-lowering medication. other adverse events reported
were again headaches, hypothyroidism, leukopenia and asthenia.
for patients who developed hypothyroidism (24 out of 58),
levothyroxine was administered and symptoms associated with
hypothyroidism resolved with treatment or within a week of
discontinuing  xxxd330xxx  therapy.
duvic and colleagues also studied the efficacy of  xxxd330xxx 
in patients with refractory, advanced stage (iib–iv)  xxxg2343xxx  in
a multinational phase ii/iii trial [15]. a total of 94 patients
were enrolled at 26 multinational study centers between
november 1996 and july 1998. a total of 56 patients were
started at a dose of 300 mg/m2/day, and another 38 patients
enrolled earlier in the study were given doses greater than
300 mg/m2/day (either 500 or 650 mg/m2/day). ccr or pr
occurred in 45% of patients (25 out of 56) starting at
300 mg/m2/day and 55% of patients (21 out of 38) commencing at doses greater than 300 mg/m2/day. clinically,
there were improvements in overall bsa involvement, cutaneous tumors, clinically abnormal lymph nodes, pruritis and
patient-assessed  xxxg2343xxx -specific quality of life measures. the
median time to response was approximately 180 days for
patients starting at 300 mg/m2/day and 59 days for those starting
at higher doses. of the 25 responders in the 300-mg/m2/day
arm, nine relapsed with a median time of approximately

183

299 days. of the 21 responders in the higher dose arm, eight
relapsed with a median time of 385 days. all patients in the
trials were monitored for adverse affects. patients in the lower
dose arm were monitored for a median of 19.1 weeks and
those in the higher dose arm were evaluated for a median of
34.4 weeks. all but one patient experienced at least one
adverse event. much like the prior studies, similar symptoms
of hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, leukopenia and pruritus were
again noted. of these symptoms, the most common dlts
were hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, which
occurred in 43% of patients, followed by leukopenia and neutropenia that occurred in 9% of patients. overall, these studies
showed  xxxd330xxx  as a single agent to be effective with durable
responses and an acceptable safety profile.
 xxxd330xxx  as a topical gel formulation has been studied
for limited stage ia  xxxg2343xxx  as an alternative option to topical
steroids and nitrogen mustard. a phase i/ii trial involving 67
stage ia–iia mf patients demonstrated a complete response
(cr) in 21%, a pr in 42%, and a median time to response of
approximately 20 weeks. a later phase iii trial with refractory
stage ia–iia mf patients resulted in a 44% response rate with
an 8% cr. topical  xxxd330xxx  is effective as a long-term monotherapy for limited mf lesions, but may be less convenient
than other topical therapies as it requires application several
times per day [33].
combination therapy

based on these findings,  xxxd330xxx  was tested in combination with other treatment modalities, such as photopheresis,
ifn and puva. several cases have been reported with rapid
and sustained remissions in early stages and in patients with
sézary syndrome. a total of five patients with documented
sézary syndrome were treated with combination  xxxd330xxx 
and puva. all patients responded with a decrease in the
sézary count, improvement in the lymphadenopathy and
clearing of the skin disease. the scandinavian mycosis fungoides group first described the use of a retinoid and puva
in 1984. however, the treatment of  xxxg2343xxx  with puva was
first reported by gilchrest and colleagues in 1976 [34]. the
mechanism of puva function is believed to be via the binding
of uva-activated psoralen to dna. this results in apoptosis
of neoplastic t-cells in the skin and superficial capillaries, as
well as affecting lymphocyte function and migration. there is
a synergistic effect when  xxxd330xxx  is added. retinoids
induce reduction in epidermal thickness that enhances puva
penetration. when puva treatment alone is compared with
puva plus retinoid, there is no difference in the response
rate. however, the response was achieved with fewer puva
treatments with lower cumulative uva dose and longer duration of remission when maintenance retinoids were given.
while no single therapy has shown to be curative in  xxxg2343xxx ,
combination therapy may function synergistically to correct
the immune abnormalities of the disease and induce sustained
remission [35].

expert rev. anticancer ther. 4(2), (2004)

 xxxd330xxx 

other combination therapies being studied in early-phase
clinical trials utilize the immunomodulatory effects of  xxxd330xxx  to enhance the susceptibility of neoplastic cells to  xxxd1832xxx  ( xxxd1832xxx ®, ligand pharmaceuticals inc.) [36].
 xxxd1832xxx  is an il-2 fusion toxin whose mechanism
of cytotoxicity is dependent on binding to the  xxxg1175xxx 
( xxxg1175xxx ), with subsequent receptor-mediated internalization of
the toxin. the toxin then inhibits protein synthesis by adenosine
diphosphate ribosylation of  xxxg679xxx . early in-vitro
studies using  xxxg2343xxx  cell lines exposed to  xxxd330xxx  resulted in
upregulation of cell-surface expression of  xxxg810xxx   xxxg1174xxx   xxxg1652xxx   xxxg1751xxx   xxxg2300xxx  and p75, the subunits of  xxxg1175xxx . these treated cells were then exposed to  xxxd1832xxx  and protein synthesis and cell growth were
monitored. as compared with control, there was 50–70%
inhibition of protein synthesis and an increase in cytotoxicity.
based on these findings that  xxxd330xxx  upregulates  xxxg1175xxx , the
combination of  xxxd1832xxx  and  xxxd330xxx  are being
assessed in phase i trials to evaluate enhanced cytotoxicity.
limited data suggest that  xxxd330xxx  may have activity in
b-cell lymphomas of the skin. in one particular report, a 56-yearold male was diagnosed with a follicle center b-cell cutaneous
lymphoma [37]. having deferred treatment with surgery, radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy, the patient was treated with
intralesional  xxxg1137xxx . his cutaneous lesions improved but
required monthly injections as the tumors reappeared.  xxxd330xxx  gel was applied twice daily and within 2 months the
lesions resolved with no evidence of recurrence. the patient has
been followed for 1 year and  xxxd330xxx  applied on an as-needed
basis with  xxxg1137xxx  injections every 3 months.
 xxxd330xxx  in other malignancies

the role of  xxxd330xxx  has been studied in other malignancies,
particularly in breast and lung cancer. from initial in-vitro and
in-vivo studies, retinoids were shown to have activity against the
growth and invasion of cancer cells. early studies using 9-cis
 xxxd3417xxx  showed prevention of mammary tumor development in mice models. however, when used in clinical trials, the
drug was found to be too toxic, with patients developing liver
toxicity, skin changes, cracking of the lips and headaches [38].
with the development of an rxr-specific drug,  xxxd330xxx 
was initially investigated in preventing mammary tumorigenesis
using mice models prior to clinical trials assessing activity in
refractory breast and lung cancer.
using the mmtv-erbb2 transgenic mouse model, which
results in the development of  xxxg730xxx  (er)-negative
mammary carcinoma, mice were treated with either control or
two different doses of  xxxd330xxx  from 3 to 17 months of age
[39]. the time for tumor development and size were monitored.
by 17 months, 100% of the control mice developed tumors. in
the experimental group, 74% of the low-dose-treated (10 mg/kg)
mice developed tumors, while in the high-dose-treated
(100 mg/m2) arm, only 24% developed tumors by the end of
the experiment. the median time to tumor development was
234 and 321 days for the control and low-dose-treated mice,
respectively. a median time was not reached for the high-dose

www.future-drugs.com

group by the end of the experiment. the suppressive effects of
 xxxd330xxx  were determined to be due to its inhibition on
tumor proliferation and not to downregulation of erbb2 transgene expression. the findings suggest that  xxxd330xxx  was able
to prevent er-negative mammary tumor development as well
as er-positive tumors, as demonstrated by prior studies by
gottardis and colleagues [40].
 xxxd330xxx  has also been shown to cause regression in rat
mammary carcinoma. in another study,  xxxd330xxx  caused
complete regression in mice breast cancer models that had
failed on tamoxifen. mechanistically, this was again due to the
drug’s antiproliferative affect. agarwal and colleagues showed
that  xxxd330xxx  was able to induce adipocyte-specific gene
expression, particularly ap2,  xxxg434xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx  [41]. there is a
correlation with inhibition of cellular proliferation with upregulation of these adipocyte-specific genes. in the study by agarwal
and colleagues, there was a significant increase in expression of
adipocyte-related genes in responding tumors compared with
control [41]. specifically, responding tumors treated with  xxxd330xxx  had an eightfold, 2.8-fold and 2.45-fold increase in the
expression of ap2,  xxxg434xxx , and  xxxg1807xxx , respectively. histologically, the responding tumors had a decrease in cell layers,
increased stromal surroundings and a more differentiated phenotype.  xxxd330xxx  is believed to induce tumor regression by
inducing adipocyte differentiation in tumor cells with subsequent
terminal cell division and cell death.
from these and other preliminary findings showing  xxxd330xxx  having effects on breast tumors that have developed resistance to hormono- and chemotherapy, a multicenter phase ii
study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  xxxd330xxx  therapy for patients with progressive metastatic breast
cancer. a total of 146 patients were enrolled in the study and
divided into three groups based on hormone therapy- (48
patients), chemotherapy- (51 patients) and tamoxifen-refractory
status (51 patients). within each group, approximately twothirds received  xxxd330xxx  at 200 mg/m2/day while the other
third received a higher dose at 500 mg/m2/day. two patients
from both the hormone- and chemotherapy-refractory groups
responded, while only one patient from the tamoxifen-refractory
group responded. the duration of response was approximately
345 days and all the responses noted were from patients
receiving the lower dose of  xxxd330xxx . overall, 18% (27 out of
146 patients) of the total number of patients enrolled achieved
clinical benefit with either a cr, pr or stable disease greater
than or equal to 6 months. the median time to progression
ranged from 8.3 to 9.6 weeks [42].
most patients assigned to the lower dose did not require dose
adjustments, unlike patients receiving a dose of 500mg/m2/day.
in the latter group there were more incidences of drug-related
adverse events, higher levels of hypertriglyceridemia and more
dlts. there were no treatment-related deaths or episodes of
pancreatitis. the main reason for withdrawal from the study
was disease progression (79%). in this study, oral  xxxd330xxx 
resulted in limited clinical activity for patients with progressive
metastatic breast cancer refractory to chemotherapy and/or

hormonal therapy. future efforts are needed to define patient
populations that are likely to benefit from  xxxd330xxx . ongoing
studies are evaluating the role of  xxxd330xxx  as a potential
chemopreventive drug for healthy women at high risk for
breast cancer.
the role of  xxxd330xxx  in lung cancer may be promising,
based on a multi-institutional phase i/ii trial combining
 xxxd330xxx  with cisplatin and vinorelbine in advanced nsclc
[43]. in total, 43 patients were treated in this phase i/ii study. in
the phase i portion of the study where the maximum tolerated
dose was determined to be 400 mg/m2/day, 23 patients were
treated. a total of 28 patients (including six patients from the
phase i portion being treated at 400 mg/m2/day) were entered
into the phase ii portion, with disease stage limited to
stage iiib and iv. of the 28 patients in the phase ii portion,
seven (25%) had a pr, with one having a near complete resolution of radiographically determined lesions. the median
survival time was 14 months, with nine of the 28 patients still
alive after more than 2 years of follow-up. the projected 1-, 2and 3-year survivals are 61, 32 and 30%, respectively. these
findings are among the best reported for phase ii studies
involving patients with stage iiib/iv nsclc. a phase iii trial
is currently underway to compare  xxxd330xxx  combinations
with cytotoxic agents alone.
future prospects

the data obtained thus far has revealed  xxxd330xxx  to be an
effective and provocative new armament to control  xxxg2343xxx . the
mechanism by which it is able to achieve disease control is via
the heterodimers formed between rxr and the various nuclear
hormone receptors. these heterodimers allow expression of vital
genes that play a role in differentiation, apoptosis and inhibition
of tumor promotion. it may also influence the inflammatory
response and specific immunity.  xxxd330xxx  is the first and only
retinoid approved for use in  xxxg2343xxx . it allows for a noninvasive,
convenient and oral administration that limits the complication
sometimes associated with chemotherapy. from the clinical trials,
the most common toxicities associated with the drug are hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism. both are easily managed
with monitoring and medication. it is well tolerated, safe and
effective in both early and advanced stage  xxxg2343xxx .
with current standard therapy, there is still no cure for
 xxxg2343xxx . however, there are guidelines for treating  xxxg2343xxx  based
on stage. for patients with stage ia or ib, treatment using
narrow-band uvb, topical nitrogen mustard and  xxxd330xxx 
gels provide long-term remission with minimal toxicities.
another therapeutic option is the use of total surface electron
beam (tseb) therapy, where a fraction of patients treated may
achieve complete remission cure. patients receiving tseb
therapy unfortunately experience long-term complications
from radiodermatitis, hair loss and secondary skin malignancies,
which may impact on their quality of life. for patients with
stage iia disease, puva is used in addition to topical treatments
for adequate disease control. in patients with stage iib and iii
disease, a combination of systemic and topical therapies is

185

generally required. the use of  xxxg1137xxx  and puva phototherapy
has a high response rate and a long median duration of
response, but in patients who require other systemic modalities,
 xxxd330xxx  can be used with acceptable toxicities. when available, extracorporeal photopheresis is effective for patients with
sézary syndrome and stage iii disease. when patients fail to
have adequate response to combination therapy and  xxxd330xxx , systemic chemotherapy either as single-agent methotrexate
or combinations of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and etopside are used. patients with stage iv
disease require systemic therapy with an initial choice for
 xxxd330xxx . combination chemotherapy provides only transient response and a more aggressive modality, such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, should be considered in
patients of the appropriate age, performance status and with a
suitable stem cell donor.
as more information is learnt about the mechanisms of
retinoids and the biology of tumors, it is likely that the role of
 xxxd330xxx  may encompass treatment of other malignancies. the
early trials in lung cancer appear to be promising and further
studies are being assessed to determine whether the addition of
retinoids to chemotherapy add benefit to survival. in addition, as
there is an increased focus upon targeted molecular therapies
such as the various  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, there may be a
potential for combination treatment with  xxxd330xxx  to treat
malignancies from different pathways.  xxxd2071xxx  play an
important role in the intracellular pathways and can be powerful
agents. however, their exact function needs to be determined
before they can be fully exploited in the treatment of cancer.
expert opinion

 xxxd330xxx  is a unique agent in the treatment of  xxxg2343xxx  in that
it offers an extremely high rate of pr or cr without exposing
the patient to risks of myelosuppression from chemotherapy,
chronic photo damage the skin, radiation damage to the skin or
immunosuppressive effects of the corticosteroids. in selected
patients, durable responses can be maintained for several years,
thus delaying the introduction of more toxic therapy.
 xxxd330xxx  is available as both a topical gel and an oral formulation. the topical gel has a high response rate in patients
with patch and plaque stage  xxxg2343xxx . its principal toxicity is
local erythema at the site of application; this subsides with
time. the response rate and duration of response compare
favorably with other topical agents such as corticosteroids or
topical nitrogen mustard, however, unlike topical nitrogen
mustard, unmaintained responses to topical  xxxd330xxx  are rare.
the principal toxicities of systemically administered  xxxd330xxx  are central hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. the
hypothyroidism can be managed by hormone replacement; it
should be noted that monitoring of tsh levels is not useful in
this setting. the hyperlipidemia can be managed with  xxxd2096xxx 
or reduction of the dose of  xxxd330xxx  from 300 to
200–225 mg/m2. as with any patient receiving treatment with
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl  xxxd1739xxx  (hmg-coa) reductase
inhibitors, monitoring for myopathy and liver disease is required.

expert rev. anticancer ther. 4(2), (2004)

 xxxd330xxx 

since the toxicities of  xxxd330xxx  do not overlap with other
modalities useful in  xxxg2343xxx  treatment, it is an ideal agent for combination with uvb radiation, puva photochemotherapy, ifns,
 xxxd1832xxx  and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.
five-year view

over the next 5 years, new information regarding the biology,
pharmacology and clinical usefulness of  xxxd330xxx  will refine
its use in medical oncology. first, additional basic science data
is being developed to delineate the mechanism of action of this
drug and to clarify if its antitumor effect is due to enhanced differentiation of malignant cells, changes in the stroma or blood
vessels surrounding the tumor, or induction of apoptosis in the
tumor cells. this information will be valuable as it will provide
a rational basis for combination therapy using  xxxd330xxx .
the application of gene array technology will permit identification of sets of genes activated in the malignant cells of  xxxg2343xxx .
this information will permit a more rational combination of
therapies for the treatment of this malignancy.
a clearer understanding of the toxicities of  xxxd330xxx  will
develop over the next 5 years. specifically, the effect of this drug
on lipid metabolism will be better understood and will lead to
more effective management of hypertriglyceridemia.
clinical trials are currently ongoing to explore the role of
 xxxd330xxx  combination with phototherapy, chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. the optimum combination of these different
modalities may permit dose attenuation of  xxxd330xxx  to further
limit toxic effects. finally, clinical trials are ongoing to investigate
the role of  xxxd330xxx  in solid tumors. combinations of
 xxxd330xxx  and cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung
cancer have shown statistically significant prolongation in survival in patients with advanced nsclc. should these data be
confirmed, this will identify another important role for this
interesting compound.
