abstract
 xxxg674xxx  has been shown to be associated with greater myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in which oxidative stress
plays a key role. the efficacy of  xxxd358xxx , a mixed eta –etb endothelin receptor antagonist, in protecting the myocardium
from ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress was studied in open-chest wistar rats. anesthetized adult male rats (175–
250 g b wt) underwent sham operation (sham group) or were subjected to 40 min of myocardial ischemia (mi) induced by
temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) followed by 2 h reperfusion (r). rats submitted to
the mi-r protocol were administered  xxxd358xxx  at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.v. 20 min (bos group) or saline (con group) 20 min
post-occlusion of lad. after the 2 h reperfusion period the animals were euthanized and the heart rapidly excised. cardiac
tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical assay and were fixed in 10% formalin solution for histologic
evaluation. myocardial i-r resulted in a significant increase ( p < 0.05) in the myocardial malondialdehyde levels and a decrease
( p < 0.01) in the myocardial  xxxd2213xxx  content. these changes were associated with significant decreases in the
myocardial activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase ( p < 0.05) and catalase ( p < 0.01) and severe tissue damage
in the jeopardized myocardium in the con group as compared with the non-myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (nmi-r) sham
group.  xxxd358xxx  exerted marked tissue protective effect as assessed by histologic evaluation of the myocardium. the drug
significantly ( p < 0.05) attenuated myocardial oxidative stress and restored the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms as
compared with the saline-treated controls subjected to the mi-r protocol. furthermore,  xxxd358xxx  also exerted a marked effect
on peripheral hemodynamics and heart rate during the reperfusion phase (data reported elsewhere).
these results are consistent with the concept that  xxxg674xxx  may be involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia
and infarction. this study demonstrates the antioxidant effect of non-selective endothelin receptor antagonism elucidating that,
part of the aetiology of ischemia and reperfusion induced myocardial injury involves impaired antioxidant defenses. (mol cell

introduction
myocardial ischemia develops when the coronary blood supply to the myocardium is insufficient in relation to the energy

demands of the tissue [1]. during myocardial ischemia oxygen deficiency leads to tissue necrosis, changes in metabolic
pattern and cardiac function including depression in contractile activity [2, 3]. clinical and experimental studies have

demonstrated that reperfusion of the occluded coronary artery
during the early stages of ischemia is essential to prevent
tissue damage [4–6]. however, reperfusion after a certain period has been shown to exert deleterious effects resulting in
enhanced myocardial injury, known as ‘reperfusion injury’
[7–9]. myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (mi-r) injury has
been demonstrated in different species and experimental settings [8, 9]. furthermore, mi-r injury has been observed
to be a clinical condition occurring in association with and
during different clinical procedures such as thrombolysis, angioplasty, and coronary bypass surgery, all commonly used to
re-institute coronary flow to the ischemic myocardium so that
as much tissue as possible can be salvaged before it becomes
irreversibly injured [9–12].
the mechanisms mediating myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury are far from clear. however, several studies suggest an important role for intracellular ca2+ overload
[9, 13, 14], oxidative stress [15–17] and microvascular injury
[18, 19]. studies using antioxidants or free radical scavengers
suggest that oxidative stress and free radical generation are
important mediators of myocardial damage [21–23].
coronary vascular and microvascular injury results in a
variety of cellular events including the release of endothelin,
which may contribute to the decreased microvascular flow in
the myocardial reperfused region [24].  xxxg674xxx  (et-1)
is a 21-amino acid vasoactive peptide, which was initially isolated from the culture medium of endothelial cells [25]. et-1
produces potent and long lasting coronary vasoconstriction
[26]. enhanced plasma levels of et-1 have become associated
with a number of cardiovascular disorders in man, including
an attack of angina pectoris [27, 28], coronary artery vasospasm [29] and congestive heart failure [30]. however, the
role of et-1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders is still unclear. the hypothesis that et-1 has a role in the development
of myocardial injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion is
supported by the findings that inhibition of endogenous et
by monoclonal antibodies resulted in reduction of myocardial
infarct size in rat [31] and rabbit [32] ischemia-reperfusion
models. however, numerous studies using potent selective
and non-selective antagonists of the et receptor subtypes, i.e.
eta and etb have reported conflicting results. some workers have reported significant cardioprotection with the mixed
eta –etb endothelin receptor antagonist,  xxxd358xxx  [33, 34]
and the selective  xxxg676xxx  antagonist bq-123 [35]. however, other studies have failed to show myocardial protection
by  xxxd358xxx  [36], bq-123 [37] or fr 139317 which is another
 xxxg676xxx  antagonist [38].
in view of the above discordant reports, the present study
was undertaken to determine the efficacy of  xxxd358xxx  in reducing myocardial cell death following 40 min of ischemia
and 2 h of reperfusion; and evaluate its ability to suppress
lipid peroxidation and restore the antioxidant defenses of the
myocardium.

materials and methods
the present study protocol and the experimental procedures
therein were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal ethics committee of the all india institute of medical
sciences (aiims), new delhi, india. experiments were conducted in accordance with the institute guidelines on the use
and care of laboratory animals in research. rats used in
the present study were obtained from the central animal
facility of the institute (aiims) and housed in polyacrylic
cages (38 cm × 23 cm × 10 cm) with not more than four
animals per cage. they were housed under controlled laboratory conditions at a temperature of 25 ± 2 ◦ c under natural
light and dark cycles (approximately 14 h light/10 h dark).
the animals had free access to water and standard rat diet
(hindustan lever ltd., india). all chemicals were obtained
from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa, and were of
analytical grade.

surgical procedures
adult male wistar rats weighing between 175 and 250 g
were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg: intraperitoneally). after tracheotomy had been carried out, the
animals were mechanically ventilated with room air by a respirator for small animals (inco, india) at a tidal volume
of 15 ml/kg body weight and at a rate of 70 strokes/min to
maintain normal po2 , pco2 and ph parameters. the right
carotid artery was cannulated to permit continuous monitoring and recording of systolic (sap), diastolic (dap) arterial
blood pressures and heart rate (hr). the left jugular vein
was cannulated for administration of drug and/or 0.9% saline
solution.
a lateral thoracotomy was performed through the fifth intercostal space to expose the heart. the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) was separated from the surrounding tissue, a silk ligature was placed around the artery 2–3
mm from its origin and the ends of this ligature were passed
through a plastic tube to form a snare. care was taken not
to include veins draining blood from this area. the total thoracotomy time was about one minute. myocardial ischemia
was produced by pulling the silk thread placed around the
lad through the snare so as to occlude the lad totally.
thereafter, reperfusion was instituted by gently releasing the
snare around the lad. the animals underwent 40 min of
myocardial ischemia confirmed visually by the cyanosed appearance of the affected epicardium and 2 h of reperfusion
visually confirmed by the reactive hyperemia of the affected
epicardium. hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously throughout the entire experimental period (2 h,
40 min) and were recorded before lad occlusion (0 min,

baseline value) and, thereafter, at pre-set time-points (data
not shown here). after surgical preparation, sufficient time
(30 min) was allowed to reach steady state conditions of all
recorded hemodynamic variables, thereafter, baseline measurements were performed.

treatment protocol
rats were randomly divided into two surgical categories:
sham operation, i.e. non-myocardial ischemia-reperfusion
(nmir: sham; n = 15) or myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (mi-r) protocol. the mi-r animals were further assigned to two groups: saline-treated control group (con;
n = 17) or  xxxd358xxx -treated group (bos; n = 17). animals
were administered  xxxd358xxx  (3 mg/kg, i.v.) or saline 20 min
after lad occlusion.
rats in the sham-operated group underwent all the aforementioned procedures except occlusion of lad and institution of ischemia and reperfusion. hearts from these animals
served as (sham) controls for biochemical estimations as described subsequently.

histologic evaluation
after removal, the myocardial tissue was immediately fixed
in 10% buffered formalin solution. the fixed tissue samples
were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 5 µm thickness and subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
the sections were examined by light microscopy and photomicrographs were taken. the investigators performing the
histologic evaluation were blind to biochemical results and
to treatment allocation.

statistical analysis
all numerical data in text, figures and tables are expressed as
the mean ± s.d. statistical analysis was performed by oneway analysis of variance (anova) or repeated measures
anova when data were compared at different time points
within a study group and for time courses between study
groups, followed by the bonferroni post hoc test. differences
were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.

survival/mortality of experimental animals

following the surgical procedures the heart was rapidly excised and fixed in 10% formalin for histologic evaluation
(n = 5 for sham, n = 7 for con and bos groups) and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical estimations
(n = 7 for all groups). frozen tissues remained in liquid
nitrogen until homogenization for the various biochemical
assays.

a total number of 49 rats were included in this study. no
mortality was observed in the sham-operated (nmi-r) group
(sham) comprising of 15 rats. in the saline-treated (mi-r)
control group (con), of the seventeen rats subjected to ischemia (40 min) and reperfusion (2 h), one rat died during
the ischemic period, one died on reperfusion and 15 rats survived the entire experimental period (2 h, 40 min). in the
 xxxd358xxx -treated (mi-r) group (bos), of the seventeen rats,
one died immediately following lad occlusion and sixteen
survived. in each case the animals died due to acute ventricular arrhythmias immediately after lad occlusion and/or on
reperfusion.

biochemical studies
hearts stored in liquid nitrogen were brought to room temperature and weighed. a 10% homogenate was prepared in
50 mm phosphate buffer, ph 7.4 and an aliquot was used
for the assay of malondialdehyde (mda) according to the
method of okhawa et al. [39]. the rest of the homogenate
was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant
thus obtained was used to estimate the myocardial reduced
glutathione (gsh) content according to the method of maron
et al. [40], and the myocardial activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (sod) by the method of misra
and fridovich [41] and catalase (cat) by the method of aebi
[42]. cardiac protein levels were determined according to the
method of lowry et al. [43] using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
standard.

effect of  xxxd358xxx  treatment on myocardial oxidative stress
myocardial malondialdehyde (mda) levels
the myocardial mda levels were estimated to evaluate the
oxidative stress occurring during mi-r, and to assess the
efficacy of dual (eta –etb ) endothelin receptor blockade in
reducing lipid peroxidation.
myocardial mda levels in the sham group were 60.8 ±
9.28 nmol/g tissue. following reperfusion of the ischemic
myocardium, mda levels in the con group were significantly increased to 84.9 ± 8.91 nmol/g tissue; p < 0.05
versus sham group. however, with  xxxd358xxx  treatment

myocardial antioxidant enzymes
myocardial superoxide dismutase (sod) activity
myocardial sod activity was significantly ( p < 0.05) decreased in the con group as compared with the level of
activity of this important antioxidant enzyme in the sham
group.  xxxd358xxx  at the dose used in the present study elucidated significant ( p < 0.05) restoration of the myocardial
sod activity to near normal level (table 1).

myocardial mda content was reduced to 64.7 ± 7.8 nmol/g
tissue, a level that was significantly ( p < 0.05) lower than
that seen in control hearts (fig. 1).

myocardial content of the intracelluar antioxidant gsh was

ischemia-reperfusion resulted in a significant ( p < 0.01)
decrease of the gsh content in the con group (0.79 ± 0.20
µmol/g tissue) as compared with sham group. treatment
with  xxxd358xxx  increased gsh content to 1.68 ± 0.30 µmol/g
tissue, a significant ( p < 0.05) increase compared with con
group (fig. 2).

myocardial catalase (cat) activity
myocardial cat activity was found to be significantly ( p <
0.01) reduced in the con group as compared with the level
of activity in the sham group.  xxxd358xxx  treatment resulted
in a significant ( p < 0.05) augmentation of the myocardial
cat activity as compared with the con group receiving only
saline (table 1).
histologic evaluation
microscopic histology revealed that the non-infarcted myocardium in the sham group is characterized by an organized pattern and shows normal architecture of the myocardium (fig. 3a). however, marked morphological and
pathological degeneration of myocardial tissue was seen in
the heart sections of rats from the con group (fig. 3b). the
sections showed complete myonecrosis with fibroblastic proliferation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, marked intramyocellular edema plus vacoular degeneration and rounder nuclei as compared to the sham-operated group. administration
of  xxxd358xxx  (bos group) effectively restored the myocardial
tissue architecture to near normal level (fig. 3c), which was
comparable to that observed in the sham-operated group. the
drug markedly prevented myonecrosis; infiltration of inflammatory cells, vacoular changes as well as edema as compared
with the control group.

discussion
reperfusion is the primary requisite for salvaging ischemic
myocardium and limiting infarct development [4–6]. experimental and clinical data suggest that reinstitution of blood
flow to the previously ischemic myocardium may contribute
to additional tissue injury and profound structural, biochemical and functional abnormalities [2–12]. mechanisms mediat-

ing mi-r injury are incompletely defined. however, cytosolic
ca2+ overload [9, 13, 14] and oxidative stress [9, 15–23] are
postulated as the major mechanisms underlying several manifestations of reperfusion injury. it has been suggested that
oxygen-derived free radicals may alter the key mechanisms
which are involved in ca2+ movement in the myocardial cell
thus leading to intracellular ca2+ overload [44].
several studies have confirmed that generation of oxygenderived free radicals including superoxide anion (o2 − ), hydroxyl radical (oh• ) and their intermediary  xxxd2298xxx  (h2 o2 ) is markedly increased during reperfusion [9,
15–23]. conversely, the endogenous antioxidants, including
the non-enzymatic antioxidants and the enzymatic free radical scavengers are significantly reduced after mi-r. hence,
it has been suggested that oxidative stress is critically related
to impairment of antioxidant defense system in the ischemic
myocardial tissue followed by increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ros) [9, 45, 46]. these ros have been
shown to cause significant myocardial cell damage and heart
dysfunction during mi-r injury [9, 47].
besides free radicals and ca2+ overload, other key factors
implicated in mi-r injury are microvascular disturbances [6,
18, 48] and enhanced release of et-1 [24, 27–35]. increased
plasma levels of et-1 have been reported in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases in both experimental
animals and patients [24, 27–35]. presently, two types of
endothelin receptor subtypes eta and etb have been characterized and cloned [26–37]. activation of  xxxg676xxx 
mediates vasoconstriction; whereas, the  xxxg677xxx  mediates both vasodilation and vasoconstriction depending on the
location of the receptor. however, the precise mechanism(s)
of the proischemic effects of et-1 are presently not clear. it
is suggested that the coronary constrictor effects of et-1 may
be important in mediating its potential proischemic effects in
vivo [31–34]. furthermore, et-1 has been reported to be a
receptor-mediated calcium agonist and as such it is suggested
that it may increase intracellular calcium during ischemia
[24]. direct myocardial effects of et-1 although postulated
and reported have yet to be clearly defined [33, 34]. based
on previous studies and their own experience watanabe et
al. [31] suggest that coronary occlusion damages endothelial cells of the artery and part of the heart muscle which
triggers the release of endogenous et. the enhanced plasma
levels of the peptide cause strong vasoconstriction leading to
myocardial infarction.
in the present study, the efficacy of  xxxd358xxx , a mixed eta –
 xxxg677xxx  antagonist in reducing myocardial ischemia and
reperfusion (mi-r) injury was investigated using an openchest intact heart rat model.  xxxd358xxx  was administered 20
min post lad occlusion (i.e. 20 min before initiation of reperfusion).
based on their study evidencing that ros might stimulate release of endothelin in cat hearts, de keulenaer et al.

72
suggested that oxidative stress could partly provoke myocardial damage by enhanced et-1 release [49]. oxidative stress
may result in increased activation of et-1 [50], or could be
a consequence of enhanced plasma and cardiac et-1 levels.
the present study attempts to elucidate the relationship between et-1 and oxidative stress in mi-r.
in the present study, myocardial tissue contents of gsh
were severely decreased, while those of mda were significantly increased, suggesting that an oxidative stress has occurred [15, 52]. following reperfusion of the myocardium
after a prolonged period of ischemia the peroxidation of membrane phospholipids is considered a major mechanism of tissue damage [54]. mda is an end product in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction and is frequently used as a marker for
ros production. in the present study, the myocardial mda
assay was done to evaluate the level of lipid peroxidation and
tissue damage. the significantly increased level of myocardial mda in the saline-treated mi-r control group evidences
damage due to reperfusion. treatment with  xxxd358xxx  significantly attenuated the membrane damage as demonstrated by
lower mda levels. these findings are consistent with earlier
reports [12, 52, 53].
 xxxd2213xxx  (gsh) and glutathione peroxidase
constitute the major intracellular defenses against damage
due to h2 o2 and lipid peroxidation during myocardial reperfusion injury [15, 51, 54]. in an earlier study, the release of
gsh and  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) from human hearts
subjected to global ischemia during coronary artery bypass
grafting provided an indirect evidence of oxidative stress during reperfusion [17]. in the present study, the enhanced levels
of myocardial gsh could either be because of enhanced synthesis or due to improved  xxxg981xxx  activity on
account of  xxxd358xxx  treatment.
it is well known that inactivation of h2 o2 by the antioxidant enzyme cat resulting in production of water
and oxygen is an important process of the cellular defense
mechanisms. hence, several workers have aimed to prevent
oxidative stress during mi-r by attempting to restore the
antioxidant capacity of the ischemic tissue. the beneficial
effects of antioxidants and oxygen-radical scavengers such
as sod and cat in hearts subjected to 1-r injury have been
well documented [20–22]. however, it may be mentioned
here that some studies have failed to demonstrate beneficial
effects of sod and cat in animal model of mi-r injury
[55, 56].
other methods to improve the antioxidant status of the
heart involve the enhancement of endogenous ros scavengers. drugs capable of exerting favourable influence on
the oxidant-antioxidant balance are expected to display significant cardioprotection during i-r injury.  xxxg2431xxx 
is present in the endothelial cells in rat heart [48]; and it has
been shown that et-1 enhances o2 − production [57]. in the
present study, treatment with  xxxd358xxx  afforded significantly

augmented myocardial activities of sod and cat. these results conform earlier observations and define an important
antioxidant effect of dual blockade of eta –etb endothelin
receptors.
activated neutrophils are implicated to be important mediators of tissue injury following myocardial ischemia and
reperfusion. furthermore, neutrophil aggregates may be recruited in microvascular plugging leading to the ‘no-reflow
phenomenon’. it has been shown that administration of
 xxxd358xxx  significantly improves the recovery of coronary flow
under both in vivo and in vitro conditions [34, 35]. hence, it
may be assumed that in the present study, one of the beneficial effects of  xxxd358xxx  may be the inhibition of the effects of
et-1 on neutrophils and its capability of restoring coronary
blood flow. although, inhibition of the direct effects of et-1
on the myocardium by the drug is another possibility which
cannot be ruled out.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrates that administration of  xxxd358xxx  before institution of reperfusion of the
previously ischemic myocardium enhanced the protective effect of the drug by reducing ischemia-reperfusion induced
lipid peroxidation and augmenting the antioxidant reserve
of the myocardium. these results suggest that endogenous
et-1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury; and, that  xxxd358xxx  may have the potential for cardioprotective use in acute reperfusion of the
myocardium.
