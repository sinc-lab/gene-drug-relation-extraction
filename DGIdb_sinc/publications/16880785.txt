the effects of sorafenib – an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting the tumour and tumour vasculature – were evaluated in patients with
advanced melanoma enrolled in a large multidisease phase ii randomised discontinuation trial (rdt). enrolled patients received a
12-week run-in of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). patients with changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements o25% from
baseline were then randomised to sorafenib or placebo for a further 12 weeks (ie to week 24). patients with x25% tumour
shrinkage after the run-in continued on open-label sorafenib, whereas those with x25% tumour growth discontinued treatment. this
analysis focussed on secondary rdt end points: changes in bi-dimensional tumour measurements from baseline after 12 weeks and
overall tumour responses (who criteria) at week 24, progression-free survival (pfs), safety and biomarkers ( xxxg268xxx , kras and  xxxg1605xxx 
mutational status). of 37 melanoma patients treated during the run-in phase, 34 were evaluable for response: one had x25%
tumour shrinkage and remained on open-label sorafenib; six (16%) had o25% tumour growth and were randomised (placebo, n ¼ 3;
sorafenib, n ¼ 3); and 27 had x25% tumour growth and discontinued. all three randomised sorafenib patients progressed by week
24; one remained on sorafenib for symptomatic relief. all three placebo patients progressed by week-24 and were re-started on
sorafenib; one experienced disease re-stabilisation. overall, the confirmed best responses for each of the 37 melanoma patients who
received sorafenib were 19% stable disease (sd) (ie n ¼ 1 open-label; n ¼ 6 randomised), 62% (n ¼ 23) progressive disease (pd) and
19% (n ¼ 7) unevaluable. the overall median pfs was 11 weeks. the six randomised patients with sd had overall pfs values ranging
from 16 to 34 weeks. the most common drug-related adverse events were dermatological (eg rash/desquamation, 51%; hand-foot
skin reaction, 35%). there was no relationship between v600e  xxxg268xxx  status and disease stability. dna was extracted from the
biopsies of 17/22 patients. six had v600e-positive tumours (n ¼ 4 had pd; n ¼ 1 had sd; n ¼ 1 unevaluable for response), and 11 had
tumours containing wild-type  xxxg268xxx  (n ¼ 9 pd; n ¼ 1 sd; n ¼ 1 unevaluable for response). in conclusion, sorafenib is well tolerated
but has little or no antitumour activity in advanced melanoma patients as a single agent at the dose evaluated (400 mg b.i.d.). ongoing
trials in advanced melanoma are evaluating sorafenib combination therapies.

the incidence of malignant melanoma is rising, and the current
treatment options for patients with metastatic disease are limited
and noncurative in the majority of cases (alexandrescu et al, 2005;
danson and lorigan, 2005). according to the american joint
committee on cancer, patients with advanced metastatic melanoma (stage iv) have a 5-year survival rate of only 2% (balch et al,
2001).
increased signalling through the  xxxg268xxx /mek/erk pathway, as
a result of autocrine stimulation by basic fibroblast growth
factor and  xxxg1044xxx , is implicated in melanocytic tumorigenesis (tumour growth, invasion and metastasis)
(satyamoorthy et al, 2003). furthermore, the activity of erk,
which is downstream of  xxxg268xxx , has been shown to increase from

early- to advanced-stage melanoma (satyamoorthy et al, 2003).
this increased erk activity may be the consequence of activating
 xxxg268xxx  mutations, which are present in up to 80% of human
melanomas (davies et al, 2002; chang et al, 2004; garnett and
marais, 2004). the most prevalent oncogenic  xxxg268xxx  mutation is the
v600e  xxxg268xxx  mutation (previous terminology, v599e), which is
present in 63% of melanomas (brose et al, 2002). the increased
apoptosis, observed in human melanoma cell lines when  xxxg268xxx 
expression is downregulated using rna interference, supports a
role for oncogenic  xxxg268xxx -driven mek/erk overactivation in
maintaining the transformed phenotype of malignant melanoma
cells (hingorani et al, 2003; karasarides et al, 2004). this
observation also suggests that  xxxg268xxx  is a rational target for the
design of targeted agents to treat melanoma.
the orally administered targeted-agent sorafenib (nexavars,
bayer pharmaceuticals corporation, west haven, ct, usa) was
originally developed as an inhibitor of the  xxxg268xxx  serine/threonine
kinases ( xxxg1924xxx , wild-type  xxxg268xxx , v600e  xxxg268xxx ) (wilhelm et al,
2004). however, results of in vitro studies have since shown that

clinical studies

sorafenib is a potent multikinase inhibitor, which also targets
receptor tyrosine kinases associated with tumour angiogenesis
( xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -b) and tumour progression (c-kit,
 xxxg801xxx ) (wilhelm et al, 2004). sorafenib has also been shown to
inhibit the growth of several human tumour xenograft models by
targeting tumour cell proliferation and/or endothelial cellmediated tumour angiogenesis (wilhelm et al, 2004).
sorafenib monotherapy has been shown to have a manageable
side effect profile in phase i/ii/iii studies (strumberg et al, 2003,
2005; ratain et al, 2004, 2006; awada et al, 2005; escudier et al,
2005). the most common toxicities associated with sorafenib are
hand-foot skin reaction (hfs), rash and diarrhoea (strumberg
et al, 2003, 2005; ratain et al, 2004, 2006; awada et al, 2005;
escudier et al, 2005). however, these adverse events are
predominantly mild to moderate in severity and easily manageable. the efficacy of sorafenib monotherapy in patients with
advanced, refractory renal cell carcinoma (rcc) was first
demonstrated in a phase ii randomised discontinuation trial
(rdt), which showed a significantly longer progression-free
survival (pfs) relative to placebo. sorafenib received marketing
approval in the us in december 2005 for the treatment of
advanced rcc, based on the results of the rdt as well as the
phase iii placebo-controlled targets (treatment approaches
in renal cancer global evaluation trial). the phase iii trial
demonstrated a statistically significant doubling of pfs and
longer overall survival (hazard ratio ¼ 0.72 for sorafenib over
placebo) in patients treated with sorafenib relative to placebo
treatment (nexavar prescribing information, 2006) (escudier
et al, 2005).
here, we present an analysis of the efficacy and safety of
sorafenib monotherapy in a cohort of patients with progressive
advanced melanoma.

materials and methods
patients’ characteristics and study design
this phase ii, placebo-controlled rdt was conducted at five
centres in two countries (four centres in the us, one centre in the
uk). enrolment began on 25 september 2002. all patients
participating in the rdt provided written, informed consent.
the trial protocol received institutional ethics committee approval
at each participating centre, and was conducted in accordance with
good clinical practice guidelines and the declaration of helsinki.
the design of this rdt, including patients’ details and inclusion
and exclusion criteria, has been described previously (ratain et al,
2006). briefly, eligible patients had histologically or cytologically
confirmed, progressive advanced unresectable, or metastatic
cancer. sorafenib was initially administered to all patients in a
12-week, open-label, run-in period using continuous oral dosing at
400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). after the 12-week run-in period, disease
status was assessed based on change in bidimensional tumour
measurements from baseline. patients with x25% tumour
shrinkage continued to receive sorafenib open label until they
experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whereas
patients with progressive disease (pd; x25% tumour growth or
other clinical evidence of progression) were discontinued. those
patients who had an unconfirmed change in tumour size of o25%
were randomised in a double-blind fashion to receive either
sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d., continuously, or matching placebo from
week 12 onwards. patients with progression of disease – defined as
a change in bidimensional tumour measurement from randomisation of x25%, or clinically assessed progression – at any time after
randomisation, were unblinded. progressors from the placebo
group were given the opportunity to crossover to sorafenib,
whereas those who progressed while on sorafenib were discontinued. in this analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of

sorafenib monotherapy in a cohort of patients with progressive
advanced (ie unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, who participated in this phase ii rdt.

efficacy and safety assessments
as described previously (ratain et al, 2006), the primary end point
was the percentage of patients remaining progression free at 12
weeks postrandomisation. secondary endpoints included pfs after
randomisation, overall pfs, tumour response rate and safety
(ratain et al, 2006). this analysis will focus on the changes from
baseline in bidimensional tumour measurements after the run-in
phase, tumour responses for the entire treatment period, pfs and
safety findings for a cohort of patients with advanced melanoma.
tumour response was assessed at 12 weeks, and every 6 weeks
thereafter, using standard bidimensional measurements in accordance with who guidelines for partial response (pr), stable
disease (sd) and pd. objective responses (ie minor response and
pr only) were confirmed at least 4 weeks after the original
documentation.
safety was assessed for the entire treatment period (run-in plus
randomisation). all patients who received at least one dose of
study drug were evaluable for safety. safety assessments were
performed every 3 weeks during the run-in and randomised
phases, and every 4 weeks thereafter. toxicities were graded
according to the national cancer institute common toxicity
criteria version 2.0 (nci-ctc v2.0), and relationship to study drug
was recorded.

biomarkers:  xxxg268xxx  and ras oncogenes
dna extracted from the tumour biopsies of patients was screened
for the presence of oncogenic  xxxg268xxx  and ras mutations. owing to
the majority of oncogenic  xxxg268xxx  mutations in melanoma patients
are likely to occur within the kinase domain (eg the prevalent
v600e  xxxg268xxx  mutation), exon 15 was analysed first. exon 11 of
 xxxg268xxx  was also screened for the presence of common mutations in
the glycine-rich loop. in addition, exons 2 and 3 of  xxxg1605xxx 
(university of pennsylvania and royal marsden hospital melanoma unit) and kras (royal marsden hospital melanoma unit)
were screened for common oncogenic mutations. fresh tumour
samples, obtained from patients at the royal marsden hospital
melanoma unit and the university of pennsylvania, were snapfrozen and stored at 801c until use. genomic dna from snapfrozen samples, or from paraffin-embedded blocks, was then
extracted by lysing tumour samples with proteinase k and tissue
lysis buffer, and treatment with rnase to eliminate residual rna.
the extracted genomic dna was then purified on a silica-gel
membrane column.  xxxg268xxx  and ras exons of interest were then
amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the
following primers, under optimised conditions:

phase ii sorafenib analysis in melanoma patients
t eisen et al

the pfs attributable to sorafenib was estimated by combining
information from the various treatment groups and treatment
periods. all patients contributed to the estimate of pfs for the first
12 weeks of therapy. the estimate of pfs for the first 12 weeks was
combined with an estimate of pfs after 12 weeks, the latter
assuming a patient was alive and progression free at 12 weeks.
progression-free survival was estimated after 12 weeks as a
weighted average of group-specific pfs for the two groups (ie
open-label and randomised groups). this methodology has been
fully described previously (ratain et al, 2006).

results
in total, 502 patients with a variety of tumour types, including rcc
and melanoma, were enrolled in this rdt; 501 of these patients
received sorafenib. this report focusses on the 37 treated patients
who had progressive advanced melanoma at the time of study
enrolment. the baseline characteristics of these patients are shown
in table 1. forty-one percent of these patients had an eastern
cooperative oncology group performance status (ecog ps) of 0,
and 57% of patients had an ecog ps of 1. at baseline, 70% of
these patients had failed at least one prior systemic therapy, and
27% had also received prior radiotherapy.

antitumour activity: randomised phase
although all three patients with melanoma randomised to
sorafenib progressed at 12 weeks postrandomisation (24 weeks
from initiation); only two were discontinued. the third patient was
considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit and
was, therefore, continued on sorafenib monotherapy. at 12 weeks
postrandomisation, all three melanoma patients who received
placebo had progressed and, therefore, were crossed over to
sorafenib monotherapy in accordance with the study protocol.
after crossing over, the three patients had further disease
progression at 11, 15 and 22 weeks, respectively. the patient
who progressed after 15 weeks remained on sorafenib for a total
duration of 73 weeks because, in the opinion of the investigator,
the patient was continuing to derive clinical benefit.

four patients who discontinued before the 12-week assessment all
withdrew because of adverse events: three had dermatological
events of grade 3 in severity (skin toxicity, n ¼ 1; plantar – palmar
erythema, n ¼ 2), one had a grade 4 cerebral embolic event.
at week 12, investigator-assessed bidimensional tumour measurements were available for 34 (92%) of the 37 patients. one
patient (3%) achieved tumour shrinkage x25% compared with
baseline and consequently continued with open-label sorafenib
treatment. this patient had an overall duration of treatment of 16
weeks, and pfs of 15 weeks. this patient had three measurable
lung metastases. the first lung metastasis showed 75% shrinkage
after 106 days of treatment and 84% shrinkage after 136 days. the
second metastatic lung lesion had shrunk by 80% after 106 days of
treatment and had disappeared by 136 days. the third lung
metastasis had completely disappeared after 106 days’ treatment.
six patients (16%) had tumour measurements that remained
within 25% of baseline levels. the first patient had sd after 89 days
of treatment; there was no change in tumour size until pd was
proven after 194 days of treatment. the second patient had sd
after 79 days’ treatment; there was a 5.9% change in tumour size.
after 115 days of treatment this patient was proven to have pd.
however, at a confirmatory scan after 176 days this patient had sd
again. after 428 days this patient was considered to have pd by
clinical judgment, but a scan at 512 days revealed that the patient
still had sd. the third patient developed sd after 85 days of
treatment (24% change in tumour size), was considered to have pd
after 113 days (53% tumour growth), but had re-stabilised after 184
days’ treatment (9.9% tumour shrinkage). this patient finally
progressed after 249 days’ treatment. the fourth patient had sd
after 96 days’ treatment (0.6% change in tumour size) and was still
stable after 138 days (6.4% tumour shrinkage). at 404 days this
patient still had sd (4.6% tumour shrinkage), but then progressed
after 453 days. the fifth patient with sd had progressed after 81
days on treatment, while the sixth patient had sd after 84 days
treatment (15% tumour shrinkage), and at day 124 (8.8% tumour
growth) but had pd confirmed after two scans after 237 (2.9%
growth) and 321 days’ (20.6% growth) treatment.
the patients with sd at week-12 were then randomised: three
received placebo and three received sorafenib. twenty-seven
patients (73%) had pd (ie tumour growth x25% or other clinical
evidence of progression), and were discontinued.

at the end of the entire treatment period, the confirmed
investigator-assessed best responses (who criteria) to sorafenib
were 19% sd, 62% pd and 19% unevaluable. the median pfs for
the entire treatment period, based on investigator-assessed data,
was 11 weeks (n ¼ 32; range 9 – 12 weeks). the six randomised
melanoma patients with sd had overall pfs durations of 16

safety was assessed across the entire treatment period for all 37
patients with advanced melanoma. the most common treatmentemergent adverse events, regardless of attribution, were fatigue
(81%); pain (73%); gastrointestinal adverse events, including
diarrhoea (51%) and constipation (46%); and dermatological
reactions (dermatology/skin – other, 49%; alopecia, 38%; hfs,
35%). the majority of these events were nci-ctc v2.0 grades 1 – 2.
for example, seven patients (18.9%) had grade 1 alopecia and a
further seven (18.9%) had grade 2 alopecia; none had grade 3, 4 or
5 alopecia. grade 3/4 hypertension was observed in 14% of
patients. serious adverse events were reported in 51% of the
melanoma patients, and were attributed mostly to disease
progression rather than study drug. hypertension was not
reported as a serious adverse event, and none of the melanoma
patients discontinued therapy because of hypertension. adverse
events of any grade attributed by the investigator to study drug (ie
drug-related adverse events) were reported in 89% of patients
(table 2). the most common drug-related adverse events among
melanoma patients were dermatological (rash/desquamation, 51%;
hfs, 35%; and alopecia, 35%); gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, 32%;
and stomatitis/pharyngitis, 22%); or constitutional (fatigue, 43%)
(table 2). the majority of drug-related adverse events were grades
1 – 2 in severity. in total, 8% of patients experienced serious drugrelated adverse events (all xgrade 3). no grade 4 drug-related
adverse events were reported. six patients required dose reductions because of drug-related dermatological adverse events. dose

dna was successfully extracted and screened from 17 of 22
tumour biopsies. six biopsies had oncogenic v600e  xxxg268xxx 
mutations within exon 15, while the remaining 11 had wild-type
 xxxg268xxx . of the six v600e  xxxg268xxx -positive tumour biopsies, four were
obtained from patients with pd, one from a patient with sd and
one from a patient who was unevaluable for response. only one
wild-type  xxxg268xxx -positive tumour biopsy was derived from a patient
with sd, nine were from patients with pd, and one from an
unevaluable patient.  xxxg268xxx  mutational status data for 15 patients
who were evaluable for response are shown in figure 1. no
oncogenic  xxxg268xxx  mutations were identified in exon 11 in any of the
tumour biopsies evaluated, and only one oncogenic  xxxg1605xxx  (61k)
mutation was detected. no other oncogenic  xxxg1605xxx  or kras
mutations were identified.

the efficacy and safety of sorafenib monotherapy were evaluated
in patients with advanced melanoma, who participated in a large
phase ii rdt involving patients with several advanced solid
tumour types (ratain et al, 2006). an analysis focussing on
melanoma patients was performed in the light of evidence
supporting a role for increased signalling through  xxxg268xxx /mek/
erk in the onset and progression of melanoma (davies et al, 2002;
chang et al, 2004; garnett and marais, 2004), and the prevalence of
oncogenic v600e  xxxg268xxx  mutations in melanoma biopsies (brose
et al, 2002). recent preclinical evidence, showing that blocking
v600e  xxxg268xxx  expression promotes apoptosis in human melanoma
cells, provided a rationale for targeting signalling through  xxxg268xxx /
mek/erk in the treatment of melanoma (hingorani et al, 2003;
karasarides et al, 2004). despite this rationale, the data in this
study at the 400 mg b.i.d. dose studied were disappointing, and are
most consistent with a conclusion that the drug has little or no
activity as a single agent in this disease.
in human xenograft models, sorafenib has been shown to act on
tumour cells to exert an antiproliferative effect, and on endothelial

inhibition of  xxxg1924xxx , a known mediator of taxane resistance
(britten and klein, 2000). in another phase i trial, the combination
of sorafenib with  xxxd1796xxx  induced a pr in three, and sd in five
of 10 evaluable patients with advanced melanoma (eisen et al,
2005). further investigations are warranted to determine whether
sorafenib may significantly increase response to chemotherapy
and prolong pfs in patients with advanced melanoma.
given the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting a role for
oncogenic  xxxg268xxx  in driving melanoma progression, it is unclear
why sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. did not demonstrate significant
activity as a monotherapy in advanced melanoma patients. it is
conceivable that this lack of effect is due to insufficient
concentrations of sorafenib being achieved within the plasma,
and more importantly within the tumours of these patients. the
ic50 of sorafenib in humans is approximately 5 mm (clark et al,
2005), and may not have been achieved in these melanoma
patients. however, pharmacokinetic trials of sorafenib monotherapy have demonstrated steady-state concentrations consistently
over the ic50 of 5 mm for the recommended dosage of sorafenib
(clark et al, 2005). therefore, further studies are required to
investigate this possibility. it is plausible that proliferation of
melanoma cells could be driven by an alternative signalling
pathway, after signalling through  xxxg268xxx /mek/erk has been
blocked. a further possibility is that a feedback mechanism could
negate the effect of sorafenib in these melanoma patients. this
contention is supported by the recent observation that sorafenib
administration is associated with increased  xxxg1924xxx  phosphorylation at ser338 in human melanoma and other tumour cell types
(adnane et al, 2005). however, it remains to be determined
whether such a feedback mechanism impairs clinical response to
sorafenib monotherapy in melanomas with v600e  xxxg268xxx  mutations.
in conclusion, sorafenib is well tolerated but has little or no
antitumour activity in advanced melanoma patients as a single
agent at the dose evaluated (400 mg b.i.d.). ongoing trials
in advanced melanoma are evaluating sorafenib combination
therapies.

cells of the tumour vasculature to inhibit angiogenesis (wilhelm
et al, 2004). sorafenib also induces apoptosis in several human
cancer cell lines (rahmani et al, 2005; yu et al, 2005), including
melanoma cells (panka et al, 2006b). sorafenib downregulates  xxxg1388xxx  protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner to induce
apoptosis in renal, colon and breast tumour lines (rahmani et al,
2005; yu et al, 2005). this effect involves enhanced proteasomal
degradation of  xxxg1388xxx , which could be the consequence of  xxxg1924xxx 
inhibition. finally, sorafenib induces caspase-independent apoptosis in a2058 and skmel5 melanoma cell lines (panka et al,
2006a). however, the multiple molecular targets of sorafenib, and
its dual effects on the tumour cell and the vascular endothelium,
make it difficult to determine the mechanism of effect of this
multikinase inhibitor in different tumour types, particularly in the
absence of validated biomarkers.
in the present analysis, sorafenib monotherapy was well
tolerated. seven patients had pfs lasting between 16 and 34
weeks, although it is not clear whether or not this was an effect of
sorafenib. restabilisation of disease was also observed in one
patient who was crossed over to sorafenib after progressing on
placebo during the randomised 12-week treatment phase. this
patient received sorafenib for a total of 73 weeks. there was no
apparent relationship between the presence of an oncogenic v600e
 xxxg268xxx  mutation within exon 15 and the modest antitumour activity
of sorafenib monotherapy. this latter observation is consistent
with the lack of a clear relationship reported in another sorafenib
trial (eisen et al, 2005). larger randomised clinical trials are
ongoing and will more definitively explore the relationship
between response and  xxxg268xxx  mutational status.
despite showing little activity as a monotherapy in this rdt
cohort, recently published observations suggest that sorafenib may
enhance the antitumour activity of carboplatin and paclitaxel
against melanoma (flaherty et al, 2004). in an expanded phase i
study predominantly in melanoma patients, this combination
induced one complete response (o1%), 27 prs (26%) and 61 sds
(58%) in patients with advanced melanoma (flaherty et al, 2004).
it is possible that these findings may be due to sorafenib’s
