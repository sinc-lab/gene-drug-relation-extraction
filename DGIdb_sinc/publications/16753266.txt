ments with low doses of morphine or with cholecystokinin
antagonists during late pregnancy sensitize the rat to opioidinduced inhibition of maternal behavior (miranda-paiva
et al., 2001; miranda-paiva and felicio, 2002). opioidergic
stimulation of the lateral periaqueductal gray induces a
functional meaningful neuronal activation revealed by an
increase in fos protein expression (miranda-paiva et al.,
2003; yim et al., 2006). such an activation pattern inhibits
maternal behavior by stimulating predatory hunting
(sukikara et al., 2006). opioid receptors’ role in both sensitization and the behavioral switch phenomena remains
unknown.
opioid receptors belong to the large superfamily of
seven transmembrane-spanning g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). as a class, gpcrs are of fundamental
physiological importance mediating the actions of the majority of known neurotransmitters and hormones. opioid
receptors are particularly intriguing members of this receptor
family (waldhoer et al., 2004). they are activated both by
endogenously produced opioid peptides and by exogenously
administered opioid drugs, such as morphine, which are not
only among the most effective analgesics known but also
highly addictive drugs of abuse. pharmacological studies
have defined three major gpcrs, ␮, ␬ and ␦, which are
stimulated by a family of opioid peptides (kieffer, 1995),
preferentially bind to morphine, enkephalins and dynorphins respectively (kieffer et al., 1992; minami et al., 1993;
paterson et al., 1994; uhl et al., 1994).
the genes encoding the cdnas of ␮, ␦ and ␬-opioid
receptors were subsequently isolated from different species and their structures were determined. these studies
showed that the three opioid receptor genes share a common genomic structure and their distribution in animal
tissues and the expression patterns have also been extensively examined with the aid of different techniques and
molecular probes (fowler and fraser, 1994; elde et al.,
1995; mansour et al., 1995a,c,d). expression of opioid
receptors is mainly observed in the cns, as well as
intensively expressed in the peripheral nervous system
(mansour et al., 1995a; bausch et al., 1995; minami and
satoh, 1995).
this study was designed to analyze differences in
expression of genes that encode for opioid receptors in the
periaqueductal gray (pag), striatum and hypothalamus of
nulliparous female rats. thus, this work is a first step in
understanding the role of acute and chronic morphine
treatments on modulation of opioid gene expression in
adult nulliparous female rats. these results are important

abstract—opioid receptors play an important role in female
physiology. they modulate directly and indirectly neuroendocrine phenomena that influence pregnancy maintenance,
pain threshold, parturition, lactation, maternal behavior, rewarding and addiction. thus understanding the gene expression levels of the three major opioid receptors, ␮, ␦ and ␬ in
different brain regions is essential for investigating dynamic
mechanisms of opioidergic transmission. adult virgin female
rats were treated acutely with  xxxd2670xxx  (3.5 mg/kg or
20 mg/kg s.c.) or chronically for 5 days (3.5 mg/kg). rats were
killed 1 h after the last injection. in the acute treatment,
expression levels for the encoded ␮-opioid receptor  xxxg1635xxx ,
as detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, were significantly decreased in the periaqueductal gray.
in chronic treatment, both  xxxg1633xxx  and  xxxg1635xxx  expression levels, that encoded ␬ and ␮-opioid receptor respectively,
showed significant decreases in the periaqueductal gray and
striatum. regional changes in opioid receptor gene expression levels might reflect highly specialized roles for these
receptors with possible functional meaning for the plasticity
of the opioidergic transmission. © 2006 ibro. published by

opioid receptors play an important role in female physiology. endogenous opiates are known to be involved in the
regulation of various events such as parturition and subsequent lactation and maternal behavior (gintzler, 1980;
bridges and grimm, 1982; rosenblatt et al., 1988; kinsley
and bridges, 1988; felicio et al., 1991; miranda-paiva and
felicio, 1999). surprisingly there is a scarceness of studies
investigating the expression of opioid receptor genes in the
female brain. such literature bias may be due to the perception that, differently from males, estrous cycle and reproductive state may interfere with the establishment of a
basal pattern of gene expression. nevertheless, changes
in opioid receptor expression may have a relevant physiological meaning for female reproduction. some of such
changes can be revealed by pharmacological treatments
with morphine the classical opioid receptor agonist. treat*corresponding author. tel: ⫹55-11-3091-7934; fax: ⫹55-11-3091-7829.

because they can indicate possible pharmacologically-induced alterations in the pattern of opioid gene expression.

experimental procedures
animals
female wistar rats weighing 200 –250 g at the beginning of the
study obtained from the faculdade de medicina veterinária, universidade de são paulo were used. the animals were housed in
polypropylene cages (32⫻40⫻18 cm; three animals per cage)
under controlled temperature (22⫾2 °c), with a 12 light–12 dark
schedule (lights on at 06:00 h) and had free access to food and
water during the experimental procedure. the animals used in this
study were maintained in accordance with the guidelines from the
committee on care and use of laboratory animal resources,
national research council, usa. all experiments conformed to
the faculdade de medicina veterinária e zootecnia, universidade
de são paulo guidelines on the use of animals. all efforts were
made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.

 xxxd2670xxx  treatment and tissue sampling
sixty adult female rats were randomly divided into six groups with
10 animals per group.  xxxd2670xxx  (3.5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg;
cristália, são paulo, brazil) for i.p. injection was diluted with 0.9%
nacl, formed the following groups as described in table 1. the
injections were administered at 08:00 h. chronic  xxxd2670xxx 
administrations occurred once a day for five consecutive days.
both acute treatment and first injection of chronic treatment were
always done on the day of vaginal estrous as determined by
vaginal smears. once treatment with morphine or saline was
finished, the animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and
xylazine (1:1) i.p. and then killed. animals were decapitated 1 h
after the last injection of drug. their brains were removed and
chilled rapidly on ice. the pag, hypothalamus and right striatum
were dissected according to paxinos and watson (1986). tissue
was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺70 °c until
use.

rna extraction and polymerase chain
reaction (pcr).
total rna was extracted from each individual brain tissue sample
by the trizol reagent (invitrogen®, carlsbad, ca, usa). thus, the
regions (weighing approximately 40 mg each) were suspended in
1 ml of ice cold trizol, and total rna was extracted according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. the final rna pellets were resuspended in 50 ␮l diethyl-pyrocarbonate-treated water. the total
rna concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at
260 nm and the integrity of rna samples was analyzed on a 1.5%
agarose gel (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) containing ethidium
bromide (0.5 ␮g/ml). rna was stored at ⫺80 °c until further
analysis.
rt-pcr was performed using superscripttm ii rnase
h-reverse transcriptase (invitrogen®) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. a semiquantitative pcr method was used and
each pcr reaction was carried out using selective forward and
reverse primers for ␤-actin (as an internal standard),  xxxg1635xxx ,
 xxxg1632xxx  or  xxxg1633xxx . the sequences of primers used were:  xxxg1635xxx

aga tga ccc ag 3= and reverse 5=ctc tca gct  xxxg889xxx  gtc
gtc aa 3= (300bp fragment). ␤-actin was used as an internal
control for the amplification. the following conditions were selected for pcr in a volume of 50 ␮l: rt products from 50 ng of
rna, 2.5 u platinum taq polymerase (invitrogen), 35 cycles of
amplification for  xxxg1635xxx ,  xxxg1633xxx  and ␤-actin genes, and 40 cycles
for the  xxxg1632xxx  gene. amplification was carried out using an initial
denaturing cycle at 95 °c for 2 min and subsequent cycles as
follows: denaturation, 1 min at 95 °c; annealing 1 min at 60 °c or
55 °c (␤-actin), and extension, 1 min at 72 °c. the pcr primers
were designed on the basis of published rat cdna sequences in
genbank. pcr products (10 ␮l per lane) were electrophoresed
using 1.5% agarose gel and colored with ethidium bromide
(0.5 ␮g/ml). the gel was subjected to ultraviolet light and photographed. the bands intensities were measured using a software
package (imagemaster delite, amersham biosciences inc., piscataway, nj, usa).

statistics
differences in scores between more than two groups were assessed by one-way anova followed by tukey multiple comparisons test. for comparisons of two groups, a student’s t-test was
used.

results
ethidium bromide staining of pcr products showed a
single band of the expected size: 600 bp for  xxxg1635xxx , 570 bp
for  xxxg1632xxx , 200 bp for  xxxg1633xxx  and 300 bp for ␤-actin. the
possibility of the presence of contaminating genomic dna
was ruled out by dnase out (invitrogen) which caused no
dna amplification and the design of primers was made in
different exons.
semiquantitative pcr technique was used to estimate
 xxxg1635xxx ,  xxxg1632xxx  and  xxxg1633xxx  gene expression levels in tissue
samples, normalized to an internal standard (␤-actin). data
from intact (non-manipulated animals) and saline-treated
animals were used as a control group.

discussion
since the early 1970s, when specific binding sites for
opiates were first described, there has been a vast literature on opiate receptors, their subtypes, and the multiplicity
of these subtypes (fowler and fraser, 1994). thus, opioid
receptors have been the focus of intense research with the
hopes of elucidating their roles in various physiological and
pathological processes such as motivated and consumma-

tory behaviors, learning and memory, analgesia and addiction. the studies have identified three types of receptors,
referred to as ␮, ␬ and ␦ (mansour et al., 1995a,b). with the
development of selective agonists and antagonists, it has
become clear that each type of opioid receptor has unique
pharmacological properties and is differentially distributed in
the cns (mansour et al., 1995a,b). this latter finding is
consistent with the data reported in the present study.
recent studies using real time rt-pcr detected differences in gene expression in culture cells as well as
cerebral tissues. in the current study, we used an accepted
technique, the reverse transcriptase reaction (rt) followed
by pcr. the regular pcr technique used in these experiments was sensitive enough to reveal differences in
gene expression on the cns microregions analyzed.
thus, it was considered as a dependable approach even
for studying such genes that are members of the evergrowing family of seven transmembrane gpcrs.

by screening a rat brain cdna library using a cloned ␮
opioid receptor cdna as probe, a clone was identified that
is very similar to both the ␮ and ␦ opioid receptor sequences (chen et al., 1993). analysis of sequence similarities among these opioid receptors, between opioid receptors and other gpcrs, has revealed regions of sequence conservation that may underlie the ligand-binding
and functional specificities of opioid receptors (chen et al.,
1993).
the aim of this study was to analyze differences in
expression of genes that encode opioid receptors in the
pag, striatum and hypothalamus of nulliparous female
rats. the results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to identify differences in opioid gene expression density
in the pag, striatum and hypothalamus of nulliparous female rats. the total rna extraction did not show contaminations, as well as primers designs were correct. this is
evidenced by ␮, ␦, ␬ and ␤-actin fragment products ob-

tained after pcr assay. the blast and alignment for these
cdnas confirmed this concept and a digestion with restriction enzymes was not necessary.
in intact and saline animals,  xxxg1635xxx , the gene the
encode ␮-opioid receptor, showed higher expression in the
pag than in other brain regions investigated. in this area,
there was a rank order of gene expression in which  xxxg1635xxx 
was more expressed, followed by  xxxg1633xxx  and  xxxg1632xxx . in the
striatum,  xxxg1632xxx  was the most expressed gene, followed
 xxxg1635xxx  and  xxxg1633xxx . finally, in the hypothalamus,  xxxg1633xxx 
was most expressed, following  xxxg1635xxx  and  xxxg1632xxx  gene
expression. this analysis demonstrated that mrna of
genes which encode opioid receptors are expressed in a
regionally specific manner in rat brain (minami et al.,
1993). other authors have shown that the opioid gene
expression in the adult male rat presents a quite similar
pattern to the one observed in the present study for nulliparous female rats. this finding indicates that the opioid
receptor genes expression patterns are similar in both
male and virgin female adult individuals. moreover, further
studies evaluating the effects of morphine treatment on
opioid gene expression of male rats in the same brain
regions can be made.
in the acute treatment with the 20 mg/kg dose of  xxxd2670xxx , only the ␮-opioid receptor gene expression
was decreased in pag. no changes were observed in
striatum and hypothalamus. this suggests that ␮-opioid
gene expression is more sensitive to opioidergic stimulation than genes which encode for the other opioid receptors in nulliparous female rats. consistently, recent reports
suggest that the classical morphine-induced inhibition on
maternal behavior may depend on a particular physiological state in which the dams become more sensitive to this
drug (yim et al., 2006).
these results also indicate that morphine-induced
stimulation of opioid receptors can lead to changes in
␮-opioid receptor gene activity. since the basal expression
of this gene was higher than the other opioid genes, the
inhibitory effects induced by morphine treatment were
most easily revealed. alternatively, “receptor reserve” is a
concept that arises from inactivation experiments that examined the effects of pharmacological manipulations. if,
after inactivating some receptors, concentration-response
curves display full efficacy with no depression of the maximal responses, receptor reserve is present. in addition,
the superstimulation of the ␮-opioid system in pag can
promote a compensatory response in the short term. such
a compensatory response, in this case, was a decrease in
␮-opioid gene expression.
pharmacological approaches have suggested that the
␮-opioid receptor serves as a principal site for morphine
actions in inducing behavioral reward (di chiara and
north, 1992; pasternak, 1993; wise, 1996), locomotion
(stevens et al., 1986), analgesia (porreca and burks,
1993), tolerance (aghajanian, 1978) and physical dependence (johnson and fleming, 1989). thus, the ␮-opioid
receptor signaling is activated by several drugs of abuse
(opioid and non-opioid) and therefore represents a poten-

1229

tial target for the therapeutics of addiction (narita et al.,
2001; kieffer and gaveriaux-ruff, 2002).
for decades, research has been using animal models
to identify and understand the neurobehavioral problems
that might be encountered in children, adolescents, and
young adults who were exposed to neuroactive substances such as opiates during fetal ontogeny as a result
of maternal drug use. opiates can cross the blood– barrier,
penetrate the developing cns, interact with brain receptor,
and influence some behavior (zagon and mclaughlin,
1992; vathy et al., 2003).
slamberová et al. (2002) have demonstrated that prenatal morphine exposure on gestation days 11–18 sexspecifically alters ␮-opioid receptor density in seizurecontrolling brain regions such as substantia nigra, superior
colliculus and subthalamic nucleus of adult male and female rats, and that this effect of prenatal morphine exposure depends on gonadal hormones. ovariectomized
(ovx) female rats whose mothers were treated with morphine during gestation, show an increase in ␮-opioid receptor density in the substantia nigra, but a decrease in
this density was observed in subthalamic nucleus (slamberová et al., 2005). these results show the importance of
gonadal hormones in modulation of the opioid gene
expression.
regarding female ovarian hormones, slamberová et
al. (2005) demonstrate that saline exposed, ovx and  xxxd2038xxx -treated females have higher ␮-opioid receptor density relative to ovx females which received the
same prenatal treatment with morphine during gestation.
quinones-jenab et al. (1997) showed that estrogen treatment increases the ␮-opioid receptor mrna in the ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus. thus, in this context, the
prenatal morphine exposure alters ␮, ␬ and ␦-opioid receptor in several brain regions (rimanóczy et al., 2001;
vathy et al., 2003; slamberová et al., 2003a,b) of male and
female offspring, but the gene level expression of the dams
that received morphine treatment is not studied. the
present study was designed to investigate opioid gene
expression in virgin female rats. for the chronic treatment
animals were treated with a relatively low dose of morphine
(3.5 mg/kg). even so, there is a chance that morphineinduced endocrine changes would have indirectly influenced these results. this possibility will be investigated in
future studies.
the results obtained with chronic treatment suggest
that lower doses administered for a long-term are more
effective in modification of ␮ and ␬ opioid gene expression,
then acute treatment. this result showed that morphine
effects on ␮-opioid gene expression in the pag in both
acute and chronic treatments are the same.
on the other hand, after chronic treatment with morphine, ␬ opioid receptor expression was decreased in both
pag and striatum. this suggests that ␬ expression is more
sensitive to chronic than to acute treatment. this study
did not reveal morphine-induced alterations in ␦ opioid
gene expression, possibly due to a lack of a morphine
effect on the expression of this receptor in the brain
areas analyzed.

indeed, the hypothalamus was the unique microregion
in brain in that neither opioid gene was expressed differentially when compared with other regions when challenged with morphine. consistently, classical studies have
shown that acute and chronic morphine treatments were
not able to modify neuronal activity in the hypothalamus,
and neither rna nor atp was modified in any case
(nasello et al., 1973).

conclusion
taken together, these considerations could be of importance for design of therapeutic regimens that might minimize addictive, and maximize the therapeutic properties of
opiates. more studies are necessary to understand the
dynamic adaptation of opioid genes that are likely to contribute to the different aspects of opioidergic transmission
in female reproduction. these genes can now have their
regulation evaluated, individually and in groups, to determine the important roles they play in morphine-induced
molecular and behavioral plasticity in female brain.
