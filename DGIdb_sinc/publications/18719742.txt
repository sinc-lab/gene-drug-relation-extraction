alkaline phosphatase (alp) is important in calcification and its expression seems to be associated with the inflammatory
process. we investigated the in vitro acute effects of compounds used for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases
on total alp activity from male wistar rat heart homogenate. alp activity was determined by quantifying, at 410 nm, the pnitrophenol released from p- xxxd2822xxx  (substrate in  xxxd3449xxx , ph 10.4). using specific inhibitors of alp activity and
the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we showed that the rat heart had high alp activity (31.73 ± 3.43 nmol pnitrophenol·mg protein-1·min-1): mainly  xxxg148xxx  but also tissue-specific intestinal alp type ii. both alp
isoenzymes presented myocardial localization (striated pattern) by immunofluorescence. alp was inhibited a) strongly by 0.5
mm levamisole, 2 mm theophylline and 2 mm aspirin (91, 77 and 84%, respectively) and b) less strongly by 2 mm lphenylalanine, 100 µl polyphenol-rich beverages and 0.5 mm progesterone (24, 21 to 29 and 11%, respectively). ß-estradiol and
caffeine (0.5 and 2 mm) had no effect; 0.5 mm simvastatin and 2 mm atenolol activated alp (32 and 36%, respectively).
propranolol (2 mm) tended to activate alp activity and corticosterone activated (18%) and inhibited (13%) (0.5 and 2 mm,
respectively). we report, for the first time, that the rat heart expresses intestinal alp type ii and has high total alp activity. alp
activity was inhibited by compounds used in the prevention of cardiovascular pathology. alp manipulation in vivo may constitute
an additional target for intervention in cardiovascular diseases.

introduction
alkaline phosphatase (alp;  xxxg150xxx .; orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase, alkaline optimum)
is ubiquitous in nature (from bacteria to humans); however,

braz j med biol res 41(7) 2008

its physiological role and natural substrates remain largely
unknown (1,2). the first established function of alp is its
role in bone mineralization (1-3). more recently, it has been
proposed that alp regulates lipid transport (4). alp expression in vascular endothelia of small arterioles in the

brain and heart, which normally do not mineralize, could
contribute to vascular hardening and calcification that could,
in turn, be related to vascular aging and vascular disease
(1,5).
vascular calcification, including coronary artery calcification and aortic valve calcification, is a common and
clinically significant component of atherosclerosis and cardiac valvular disease. the amount of coronary calcification
correlates with the overall coronary plaque burden and an
increased risk of myocardial infarction. the degree of
aortic valve calcification is a strong predictor of both the
progression and the outcome of aortic stenosis. these
calcified lesions contain not only various components associated with bone mineralization, such as alp, but also
inflammatory cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes. although the mechanisms underlying valve calcification have not been established, recent data suggest that
valve calcification is an active process, much like atherosclerosis, that is preceded by inflammation, lipid deposition and the accumulation of extracellular bone matrix
proteins (1,6-11).
alp represents a family of phosphomonoesterases,
which, in humans, are expressed by four different gene
loci : tissue-nonspecific (tn-alp), intestinal (int-alp), placental (p-alp) and germ-cell isoenzymes (gc-alp) (2).
tn-alp is present in a large number of tissues (mainly
located in the external side of plasma membranes via a
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor linkage) and is most
abundant in liver, kidney and bone. int-alp, p-alp and
gc-alp are tissue-specific alps (ts-alp). ts-alps are
named for the tissue with highest expression and activity
(none are expressed in just one tissue). only humans and
great apes have p-alp; all other mammals have instead
int-alp (2,12). tissue differential processing of each of the
alp gene products, for example through differential glycosylation, gives rise to tissue-specific isoforms (2,13). depending on the physiological/pathological conditions alp
can be released into intestinal lumen, plasma or bile in
various isoforms: with or without its anchor and in the
former case associated or not with membrane fragments
(2). alp isoenzymes (and isoforms) can be distinguished
by their heat stability, optimum ph, substrate affinity or
effect of several specific inhibitors or activators (2,13-19).
the variety of alp forms led our group to characterize
the effect (in vitro and/or in vivo) of several endogenous
metabolites, drugs, hormones, beverages and food components on alp isoenzyme and/or isoform activity and/or
expression. in vitro data from our group regarding alp
activity modulation will be presented shortly in the discussion of this article, since some of our previous results will be
useful for comparison with the present data (13,14,17-19).

in order to further clarify the physiological role of alp,
we have determined in vitro the acute effect of compounds,
drugs, hormones and polyphenol-rich beverages, with reported cardiovascular protective effects (for the prevention
or treatment of cardiovascular diseases) and/or known
effects on alp activity from other sources (cell lines,
tissues and species) on total alp activity from rat heart.
we hypothesize that the modulation of alp activity may be
another process contributing to explain the protection given
by aspirin, steroid hormones, statins, ß-blockers and
polyphenol-rich beverages against cardiovascular diseases.

material and methods
beverages and their preparation
lager-type beer (superbock®), stout-type beer (superbock stout®) and alcohol-free beer (cheers®) were purchased at the local market (portuguese beers produced by
unicer, portugal). green and black teas (both from
tetley®) were also from the local market. red wine (vinha
das garças®) was produced in palmela region (terras do
sado, south of portugal) by unicer and provided to us by
this company. green and black teas were prepared according to the recommendations of supplier, by infusing
one tea bag (green tea: 1.75 g for 5 min; black tea: 1.5 g for
2 min) in 250 ml boiling water. gas was removed from
beers before use. all beverages were used at ph 10.4.
animals
sixteen male adult wistar rats (free from liver and bone
diseases, purchased from harlan interfauna ibèrica,
barcelona, spain), weighing 300-340 g, were used. the
animals were maintained under controlled environmental
conditions (12-h light/dark cycle, at 24°c room temperature), in groups of 3, fed a suitable commercial diet (harlan)
with water ad libitum. animal procedures were according
to the european community guidelines (86/609/eec) and
the portuguese act (129/92) for the use of experimental
animals [the corresponding author holds a portuguese
authorization for working with laboratory animals (according to category c of the recommendations of the federation of european laboratory animal science associations)]. animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60
mg/kg) and the heart was perfused in situ with ice-cold
isotonic nacl to wash out blood. the organ was then
removed and rinsed in ice-cold isotonic nacl. for reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis, a segment from the left ventricle was rinsed with
diethylpyrocarbonate-water and stored at -80°c until the
moment of the experiment. rat heart was frozen at -80°c

until the immunofluorescence experiment. rat heart was
placed in two times (ml/g) homogenization solution [phosphate-buffered saline (pbs, ph 7.4) + 0.5% triton x-100;
4:1], with no homogenization or other form of cell disruption, and stored at -80°c until the moment of alp activity

(int-alp type ii), 246 (tn-alp) and 682 ( xxxg861xxx ). ten
microliters of each individual pcr product was then run on
1.6% agarose gel and visualized with an ultraviolet transilluminator (vilber lourmat, france) using ethidium bromide staining, a cohu ccd camera and the appropriate
filters for uv light (cohu, usa).

reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
all molecular biology reagents used were purchased
from sigma (sigma alcobendas, spain) unless otherwise
stated. after total rna extraction with tripure® (roche,
germany), 20 µg total rna was incubated at 37°c for 30
min with 23 units of rnase-free dnase i in 100 µl 5 mm
mgcl2, 50 mm triethanolamine-hcl, ph 7.5, to degrade
any residual dna. the rna was extracted with phenolchloroform, precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water. for cdna synthesis, 5 µg of the rna thus prepared
was incubated at 45°c for 1 h in a total volume of 20 µl with
200 units of superscript™ ii reverse transcriptase (rt;
gibco brl, life technologies, gaithersburg, md, usa), in
10 µm random hexamers, 0.375 mm per dntp, 3 mm
mgcl2, 75 mm kcl, 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3 (25°c), 10 mm
dithiothreitol and 40 units rnase inhibitor (rnaseout™;
gibco brl). for paired negative controls rt was omitted.
following heat-inactivation of the proteins (10 min at 95°c)
and addition of 5 µl 0.5 mg/ml dnase-free  xxxg1963xxx  in 10
mm tris-hcl, ph 8.0, and 50% (v/v) glycerol, the cdna
was incubated at 37°c for 30 min to degrade unreacted
mrna. pcr was performed on 4 µl of this preparation.
the pcr product mixture (50 µl) contained 0.5 µm per
primer, 0.2 mm per dntp, 2.3 mm mgcl2 and 2 units of taq
dna polymerase in the buffer provided (gibco brl). the
following primers for rat int-alp type i, int-alp type ii,  xxxg148xxx  and  xxxg861xxx 
( xxxg861xxx ) were used: 5'-cca gcc agc tta cca atg
aga-3' (forward primer int-alp type i), 5'-ctg cct gct

at 26°c and 2 min at 72°c for int-alp type i, int-alp type

by 40 cycles of 0.5 min at 94°c, 0.5 min at 26°c and 1.5 min

bp) of the pcr products were: 249 (int-alp type i), 218

immunofluorescence
the frozen rat heart was included in ornithine carbamyl
transferase solution (bright, england) and 5-µm thick sections were cut with a leica cryostat (leica microsystems
gmbh, germany) and placed onto poly-l-lysine coated
microscopy slides (polysine™, menzel-glaser, germany).
immunofluorescence was performed using primary antibodies (santa cruz biotechnology, usa) against int-alp
[goat polyclonal antibody ( xxxg149xxx  l-19: sc-15065), diluted
1/25] and tn-alp [goat polyclonal antibody ( xxxg148xxx  n-18:
sc-23430), diluted 1/25], for 60 min at room temperature,
after a 10-min blocking period at room temperature [10%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma) w/v in pbs]. pbs was used
instead of the primary antibodies for the negative controls.
although we have used a polyclonal antibody against palp and int-alp, only int-alp was detected since rats do
not express p-alp (2,5). a 60-min incubation was performed with the secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat
igg-fitc, sc-2024, from santa cruz biotechnology, diluted 1/200) at room temperature. washings between incubations were performed twice for 5 min each with pbs +
0.1% tween 20 (sigma). antibody dilutions were made
using ultraab diluent (labvision corporation, usa). nuclei counterstaining was achieved with dapi (4'-6diamidino-2-phenylindole, diluted 1/100, sigma) for 15
min at room temperature. slides were mounted with
vectashield (mounting medium for fluorescence; vector
laboratories, inc., usa) and observed with an apotome
microscope (axioimager.z1, zeiss system, germany), with
a light source of fixed wavelength of 488 and 350 nm, for
igg-fitc (green) and dapi (blue), respectively. the
axionvision 3.0 program (zeiss) was used to acquire
images and photographs.

heart homogenate in a final dilution of 1/13 in homogenization solution. phosphate concentration in the incubation
medium was 0.353 mm, similarly to other studies by our
group on alp activity from tissue homogenates (13,15).
levamisole and l-phenylalanine were dissolved in water.
theophylline, caffeine and simvastatin were dissolved and
diluted in dimethylsulfoxide.  xxxd234xxx  (aspirin),
propranolol, atenolol, progesterone, corticosterone and ßestradiol were dissolved and diluted in ethanol. controls
for drugs were run in the presence of a corresponding
volume of solvent. ethanol 5, 5.6 and 13% solutions were
used as solvent controls for stout-type beer, lager-type
beer and red wine, respectively. water was used as solvent control for green and black teas. incubations were
carried out at 37°c for 30 min and the enzymatic reaction
was stopped by adding 2 ml 20 mm naoh (4°c). the
absorbance of the p-npl produced by alp activity was
measured at 410 nm (spectronic genesys 5, milton roy,
usa). a p-npl calibration curve was constructed in order
to calculate alp activity. the effect of each compound or
beverage on alp activity was calculated as the percent of
the activity of the appropriate alp control.
protein determination
protein concentration was determined as described by
bradford (20), with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.

all data are reported as mean ± sem and represent the
percent of the corresponding control activity (n = number

was assessed by paired or unpaired student t-test.

levamisole and l-phenylalanine significantly inhibited
alp activity from rat heart homogenate, although levamisole had a significantly stronger effect (figure 1). while
0.1 and 0.5 mm levamisole inhibited more than 80% of alp

ylalanine inhibited just 24% of the enzyme activity. total
alp-specific activity present in rat heart homogenate was
31.73 ± 3.43 nmol p-npl·mg protein-1·min-1. as can be
seen in figure 2, rat heart expresses int-alp type ii, but
not int-alp type i. both tn-alp (figure 3a) and int-alp
(figure 3b) were expressed in the myocardium; tn-alp
clearly showed a striated pattern of distribution.
theophylline and caffeine had different effects on alp
from rat heart homogenate: theophylline significantly inhibited the enzyme (in a concentration-dependent manner) but caffeine had no effect (figure 4).
all polyphenol-rich beverages (red wine; lager-type,
stout-type and alcohol-free beers; green and black teas)
tested on alp activity from rat heart homogenate significantly inhibited the enzyme (red wine having the least
volume-dependent pattern of inhibition; figure 5). polyphenol-rich beverages had different inhibitory effects on alp:
50 µl red wine had a significantly stronger effect than the
same volume of stout-type beer or green tea; 50 µl lagertype beer and 50 µl alcohol-free beer had a significantly
stronger effect than the same volume of green tea (figure
5).
aspirin ( xxxd234xxx , 2 mm) strongly inhibited
alp activity (84%) from rat heart homogenate (figure 6);
aspirin effect was concentration-dependent.
steroid hormones behaved differently towards alp
activity. ß-estradiol (0.5 and 2 mm) had no effect on enzymatic activity. corticosterone (0.5 mm) activated (18%) but
2 mm corticosterone inhibited (13%) alp activity. progesterone (0.5 mm) inhibited (11%) alp activity, with no effect
at 2 mm. at both concentrations, corticosterone effect was
significantly different from that of the other two steroid
hormones (figure 6).

of activity), total alp activity quantification in the rat heart
and its in vitro acute modulation by compounds and polyphenol-rich beverages reported in the literature to have cardiovascular beneficial effects.
the inhibitory effects of levamisole and l-phenylalanine showed that both tn- and ts-alps were present in rat
heart (with tn-alp presenting a greater activity than intalp), since these compounds are, respectively, specific
inhibitors of these two alp groups (2,13,19). our results
are in agreement with those reported by van belle (16)
regarding the effects of levamisole and l-phenylalanine on
alp extracted from normal rat heart (without any treatment). additionally, we showed, by rt-pcr analysis, that
int-alp, namely int-alp type ii, was indeed expressed in
this tissue.
the rat has two int-alp genes (int-alp type i and intalp type ii) coding for two int-alps with different primary
structures (79% amino acid homology), temporal postnatal
expression, substrate specificity, tissue localization and
response to fat feeding and to cortisone. after an acute fat
feeding, int-alp type ii expression is increased in liver
(where int-alp type i is not expressed) and int-alp type ii
expression increases five times more than int-alp type i in
the duodenum (4,21,22). it is interesting to note that rat
liver and heart, tissues that can use fat as an energy
source in several physiological states, express the same
int-alp gene.
we hypothesized that the high total alp activity observed in the normal rat heart (without any treatment)
homogenate could not be accounted for only by the presence of alp in the vascular compartment and, by immunofluorescence, we showed that both int- and tn-alps are
present in rat cardiomyocytes, which is in agreement with
our results of total alp activity in the rat heart and of rat
heart alp activity inhibition by levamisole and l-phenylalanine. autofluorescence of vascular tissue did not allow us
to visualize alp in blood vessels. nevertheless, the presence of int-alp in the human vascular compartment of
different organs has already been reported by domar et al.
(12) and the presence of tn-alp in both the heart vascular
compartment and muscle has already been reported by
schultz-hector et al. (5). müller et al. (23) reported an
increase of alp activity, after a single injection of  xxxd2398xxx  into the right atrium, particularly on the schwann
cell and its membranes, membranes enveloping nerve
axons, the sarcolemma of the muscle cell and the fibrocyte
cell surface. these investigators (23) suggested that the
schwann cell is responsible for the production of alp.
here we report the presence of int-alp in cardiomyocytes
and the presence of both alp isoenzymes in normal rat
heart (without any treatment). although speculative, we

braz j med biol res 41(7) 2008

a. mota et al.

suggest that the distribution of specific fluorescence along
the myofibrils of myocardial cells is compatible with the
presence of alp in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
several lines of evidence suggest alp as a putative
target for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. alp is important for the initiation of calcification and
its inhibition prevents calcification, either normal or ectopic
(1-3,6-8,10,11). alp activity has been associated with
human valve calcification in vitro and in vivo (7,8,11), with
calcification of bioprosthetic heart valves from bovine pericardium in vitro and in vivo models (10) and with in vitro
sheep aortic valve interstitial cell calcification induced by
transforming growth factor-ß1 (11). these in vitro results
are supported by the rt-pcr studies of gene expression
pattern differences between human calcific aortic stenosis
and human normal aortic valve cusps demonstrating that
calcific aortic cusps have increased alp and transforming
growth factor-ß1 expression (11). an association between
cardiac valve calcification and inflammation has been reported (9,11,24). alp seems to be associated with inflammatory processes and their modulation/regulation (25,26).
in vitro and in vivo, alp activity is modulated by oxidative
stress (25,27,28). the ingestion of nutrients/beverages
with anti-oxidant properties has positive effects on cardiovascular health (29-31).
in the present study, we sought to understand the
reported “usefulness” of various compounds, hormones
and beverages for prevention and/or treatment of cardiovascular diseases. a marked alp inhibition was observed
with theophylline and aspirin, and some inhibition with
wine, beers and teas. ß-estradiol and caffeine had no
effect; simvastatin and atenolol activated alp (propranolol
also showing an activation tendency). corticosterone presented a mixed behavior on alp and progesterone slightly
inhibited it.
an inhibitory effect on rat heart alp activity would be
acceptable as a similar background for the cardioprotective effects of the compounds, hormones and beverages
tested. by reducing rat heart alp activity they would contribute to reduce or stop progression of cardiomyocyte,
vascular, valvular and/or aorta calcification improving or
stabilizing the cardiovascular system; however, that did
not occur for all of them. we concluded that only the agents
we have tested with reported preventive effects against
cardiovascular pathology have alp inhibitory activity. the
meaning of this association is presently unknown but the
importance of cardiovascular diseases strongly recommends further exploration of this link.
methylxanthines, caffeine and theophylline, have been
included in this study because a) caffeine is probably the
most frequently ingested pharmacologically active sub-

stance in the world and recent research indicates that
moderate coffee intake may be associated with beneficial
effects on cardiovascular health (32); b) theophylline is
described as an inhibitor of alp: tn-alp isoforms and tsalp isoenzymes are inhibited/modulated at different degrees (13). the theophylline inhibitory effect on rat heart
alp was similar to its effect on rat kidney cortex alp but
stronger than that on rat liver alp (13).
tea, wine and beer were used in this research because
of their extensive worldwide consumption, anti-oxidant
capacity (related to their polyphenol content) and described
health benefits in preventing cardiovascular diseases (2931). the evolution of these pathologies seems to exacerbate in estrogen-deficient women, thus, our interest in ßestradiol (33). wine, beer and tea were tested directly in
vitro (in an acute treatment) upon ecto-alp activity from a
human vascular smooth muscle (aaltr) cell line for the
first time by our group (19). a much stronger inhibitory
effect of these beverages had been observed on aaltr
ecto-alp activity (19) than on rat heart alp. these aaltr
results are largely and positively correlated with the polyphenol content of the beverages tested (19,29), what did not
happen in the case of rat heart alp.
progesterone, ß-estradiol and/or corticosterone effects
on rat liver and kidney cortex alp activity as well as on rat
brain microvessel endothelial (rbe4) cell line (13,14) are
different from those presented here. however, similarly to
our present results, in aaltr cell line ß-estradiol had no
effect while corticosterone (and progesterone) activated
the enzyme (18).
aspirin has been reported to have a protective role in
the cardiovascular system, exhibiting anti-platelet, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.
it also inhibits calcification of bovine pericardium used for
bioprosthetic heart valves (10,34). our results with aspirin
are in accordance with published data concerning the in
vivo and in vitro effects of aspirin upon alp activity. aspirin
inhibits, in vitro and in vivo, the calcium deposition and/or
alp activity in bioprosthetic heart valves from bovine
pericardium (10). aspirin, in a therapeutic concentration
range-dependent manner, inhibits alp secretion and the
stimulatory insulin effect upon alp production by human
osteoblasts in vitro (35).
it is interesting to note that two drugs sharing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have opposite
effects on rat heart alp: aspirin and simvastatin (34,36).
statins have well-known protective effects on cardiovascular health, mainly ascribed to their hypolipidemic
activity. beyond this, statins exert pleiotropic effects on
vascular wall cells, including improvement of endothelial
dysfunction, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque, de-

crease of oxidative stress and vascular inflammation
(17,36,37). on the other hand, they are reported to increase bone density (17,36). we have recently reported an
increase on alp activity in rat heart homogenate for
lovastatin (17), but not as intense as with simvastatin.
these alp activating effects may explain the lack of statin
protection against aortic valve calcification reported by
cowell et al. (for a discussion of this subject, see ref. 17).
simvastatin inhibits rat liver and kidney cortex alp activity
(17).
ß-blockers are currently used to treat cardiovascular
problems (38) and have been reported to have positive
effects on bone mineralization and/or osteoporosis (39).
the alp activating effects of propranolol and atenolol
observed here fit well with their putative beneficial effects
on bone.
epidemiological studies show a positive correlation
between osteoporosis and vascular calcification suggesting that when bone does not mineralize properly the vessels do and vice versa (6). for most of the compounds and
beverages tested there are data about beneficial effects
on bone mineralization and/or osteoporosis (17,30,31,36,
39,40).
glycosylation can influence/interfere with alp catalytic activity and alp activity modulation (2,13,19). differential glycosylation of the tn- and int-alps and/or distinct
level of expression of tn- and int-alps (assuming their
distinct modulation by the compounds and beverages
tested) can explain the distinct alp modulation results
obtained with xanthines, polyphenol-rich beverages, steroid hormones and simvastatin on the various cell lines
and/or tissues used so far as alp sources. thus, we
concluded that it is fundamental that alp activity studies
take the enzyme source into account.
to our knowledge this is the first time that alp was in
vitro acutely treated with aspirin, simvastatin, atenolol and
propranolol (simvastatin results are discussed in ref. 17),
and there are no data in the literature relating caffeine,
theophylline, ß-blockers (atenolol and propranolol) and
polyphenol-rich beverages (wine, beer and tea) and cardiomyocyte/vascular/valvular/aorta valve calcification. more
studies, namely involving chronic treatments (measuring
alp expression and performing mineralization assays)
with these compounds and beverages on cardiovascular
(and bone) tissues or cell lines are needed and strongly
encouraged by our present results.
both tn- and int-alps are associated with membrane
surfaces characterized by significant transport activity (1,2,
4,12,14,17,22,23,25). the apparent tn-alp localization in
the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads us to raise the hypothesis of alp being involved in the modulation of the

braz j med biol res 41(7) 2008

608

crucial transport of ca2+ across the sarcoplasmic reticulum
membrane, what should be investigated in the future. also,
evaluation of a putative participation of int-alp type ii in
lipid transport and deposition in rat heart muscle and
vascular compartment would be interesting, since lipid
deposition contributes to atherosclerosis and int-alp is
involved in regulating intestinal lipid transport (4). furthermore, exploration of this hypothesis (int-alp and lipid
transport at the heart) may help to clarify the pathogenesis

a. mota et al.

of lipid overstorage in cardiac myocytes in type 2 diabetes
mellitus and the development of heart failure and/or the
reduction in triacylglycerol storage and mobilization in
situations of early heart failure.
