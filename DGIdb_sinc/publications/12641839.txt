abstract
objective to assess the effects of topical ocular application of 0.25%  xxxd1830xxx 
bromide on serum acetylcholinesterase (ache) levels in normal dogs.
animals nine adult mixed breed dogs weighing between 18 and 27 kg.
procedures fifty µl of 0.25%  xxxd1830xxx  bromide were applied to one eye of each dog
every 8 h for 6 days. blood was analyzed for ache levels prior to commencement of eye
drops, and at 45 min, 1 h 45 min, 4 h 45 min, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days following
commencement of eye drops using a 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb)
reaction.
results acetylcholinesterase levels declined over the first 24 h following commencement
of  xxxd1830xxx  administration in most dogs. this decline was highly variable and was
statistically significant by 24 h. in some individuals ache levels were suppressed to levels
approaching clinical toxicity. by day 3 ache levels had risen to levels above baseline in
most dogs.
conclusions topical ocular application of  xxxd1830xxx  causes transient suppression of
systemic acetylcholinesterase levels in most dogs. acetylcholinesterase levels generally do
not fall to toxic levels, but may do so in certain individuals.  xxxd1830xxx  bromide eye
drops generally do not cause ache toxicity, but dogs receiving such therapy should be
monitored for signs of ache toxicity, and concomitant use of other ache inhibitors
should be avoided.

intro duc t io n

topical miotics have been advocated for the treatment of
canine glaucoma.1,2 they decrease intraocular pressure by
facilitating outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork.3 miotics can be divided into direct-acting
agents, which mimic the action of acetylcholine on the iris
sphincter muscle, and indirect-acting agents, which prevent
the degradation of endogenous acetylcholine.  xxxd1830xxx 
bromide is an indirect-acting miotic that is commonly used
to treat glaucoma in dogs.4 as an acetylcholinesterase
(ache) inhibitor, it prolongs the presence of acetylcholine
in the area of the motor endplates of the anterior segment
musculature, thereby causing pupillary constriction and
contracture of the ciliary body.
systemic toxicity is a potential side effect of topical
administration of ache agents in dogs and humans, with
gastrointestinal disturbances mentioned most frequently.5–7

more severe side effects have been reported in humans,
including neurologic dysfunction and cardiac arrest.8,9
these more severe side effects have not been documented in
the veterinary literature. the purpose of this project was to
measure blood ache levels following application of  xxxd1830xxx  bromide eye drops to normal dogs, and to correlate
those levels with subjective symptoms of ache-inhibitor
toxicity in an effort to establish its clinical margin of safety.

nine 3-year-old mixed breed dogs weighing between 18
and 27 kg were used in this study. physical and ophthalmic
(slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and
intraocular pressure measurement) examinations were
normal. complete blood cell counts and serum chemistry
profiles (including liver enzymes) were within normal
reference ranges.

baseline blood samples for ache levels were drawn on
the morning of day 1 of the experiment. a single 50 µl drop
of 0.25%  xxxd1830xxx  bromide ( xxxd1830xxx , merck, west
point, pa, usa) was then applied to one eye of each dog,
and repeated every 8 h for an additional 6 days. blood
samples for ache assay were drawn at 45 min, 1 h 45 min,
4 h 45 min, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days following the commencement of eye drop instillation. time points were spaced in
this fashion to detect major trends in systemic ache levels
in the immediate, intermediate, and late postdosing periods.
blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes and
placed on ice for transport to the laboratory. acetylcholinesterase levels were determined using the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb) reaction normalized to red
blood cell counts, as previously described.10 briefly, 20 µl of
heparinized whole blood was mixed with 12 ml of 0.1 
phosphate buffer (ph 8.0). dtnb (0.01 , 25 µl) was then
added to 3 ml of this mixture, followed by the addition
of 20 µl of 0.075  acetylthiocholine. acetylcholinesterase
present in a blood sample hydrolyzes the acetylthiocholine
to thiocholine, which then reacts with the dtnb reagent
to produce the yellow anion of 5-thio-2-nitro- xxxd306xxx .
the rate of color production is measured at 412 nm, and is
proportional to the amount of ache activity present in the
sample. this test has been validated for use in dogs by the
toxicology laboratory at the university of tennessee, as well
as other veterinary toxicology laboratories.11
a blood sample from each dog was assayed prior to
 xxxd1830xxx  treatment to serve as control for that dog, and
baseline and post-treatment ache activities were expressed
as a percentage of ache activity in the control samples.10 for
this methodology ache activity greater than 50% of control
is normal, 20–50% of control causes mild toxicity, 10–20% of
control causes moderate toxicity, and less than 10% of control causes severe toxicity.12 acetylcholinesterase levels before
and after initiation of  xxxd1830xxx  eye drops were compared
using an  for repeated measures and sidak’s t-test.

and reached statistical significance at the day 1 assay time
(table 1). by experimental day 3, ache activity had rebounded
to levels significantly higher (p < 0.05) than pre-eye drop
levels (table 1). gastrointestinal discomfort was exhibited
by two dogs, and both developed diarrhea during the first
day of therapy. for humane reasons, eye drop administration
was discontinued in these two dogs after the first day. acetylcholinesterase levels in these two dogs were 93% and 64%
of control at the 4 h 45 min-time period, which was approximately 4 h prior to the onset of diarrhea. blood samples at
the time of onset of gastrointestinal symptoms were not
obtained.

a decline in ache levels is well established in humans following treatment with ache-inhibiting eye drops.13–15 our
similar findings in dogs were not surprising considering the
many anecdotal reports of systemic side effects in the veterinary ophthalmic literature.4,7,16,17 however, objective documentation of the magnitude of this reduction is important
in determining the likelihood of severe, life-threatening
side effects. when using the dtnb reaction to measure
ache activity as described in this study, ache levels do not
reach life-threatening levels until they fall to below 10% of
control.12 the lowest ache levels recorded in this study
were at 24 h after the initiation of  xxxd1830xxx  treatment,
at which point there was a mean activity of 57% of control,
with the lowest level being 32%. these data indicate that
life-threatening toxicities are unlikely to occur following
every 8 h application of 0.25%  xxxd1830xxx  in medium-sized
dogs. toxicities are even less likely in the clinical setting as
most authors recommend the 0.125% concentration and/or
less frequent application in dogs.1,2 as we were most interested in major trends in ache activity rather than a detailed
toxicokinetic analysis, we did not measure levels daily between
1 and 7 days. finding the lowest level at day 1 followed by
an increase at day 3, it would be interesting to have had an
evaluation on day 2 to examine the possibility that levels
dropped further on that day. however, we feel this unlikely
in light of the dramatic rise in ache activity seen at 3 and
7 days and the absence of clinically observed side effects.

two animals in our study developed mild gastrointestinal
symptomatology that could be consistent with acheinhibitor toxicity. however, ache levels in these animals
were 93% and 64% of control shortly before the onset of
their clinical signs, so we cannot confirm a causal relationship. had we maintained these two dogs in the study, our
mean ache levels would probably have been somewhat
lower, assuming that their gastrointestinal symptoms were
actually the result of ache-inhibitor toxicity. additionally,
the animals in our study weighed between 18 and 27 kg.
owing to a higher dose of  xxxd1830xxx  when normalized
to body weight in smaller dogs, blood concentrations may
be higher (and consequently, ache levels lower) in dogs
smaller than those evaluated in this study.
the initial suppression followed by a rebound in ache
levels was similar to that observed by pickett et al.18 following application of 0.125%  xxxd1830xxx  in dogs, although the
time of maximum suppression in their study was 7 days. the
temporal difference in suppression and rebound may be due
to the lower concentration and frequency of administration
in their study. a similar phenomenon occurs in rats, in which
tolerance to daily injections of the acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor diisopropylphosphorofluoridate is associated with
increased de novo synthesis of ache in muscle tissue.19
ache rebound has not been reported in studies of ache
levels following application of ache-inhibiting eye drops in
humans.14  xxxd1962xxx  iodide, another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, maintains ache depression in humans
throughout the period of application, and ache does not
begin to rise for several days after cessation of treatment.13,14
these differences may reflect species differences or differences between  xxxd1830xxx  and  xxxd1962xxx .
the results of this study indicate that there is a wide
degree of variability in ache levels following application of
 xxxd1830xxx  eye drops in dogs, with some animals nearing
mild toxicity levels in the early phase of treatment. however,
this suppression is transient, actually rebounds to levels
above baseline within 3 days of the initiation of therapy,
and does not approach severe, life-threatening levels. close
observation for ache toxicity is advised for animals receiving  xxxd1830xxx  eye drops, especially focusing on mild gastrointestinal discomfort.
