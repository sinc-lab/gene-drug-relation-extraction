abstract conidiobolus obscurus, an entomopathogenic
fungus able to infect aphids, was previously reported to
produce substantial amounts of very long chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (vlcpufas) that may mediate the insect
infection. however, the genes involved in the biosynthesis
of these vlcpufas from the order entomophthorales have
yet to be identified. using degenerate reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of the
cdna end methods, we cloned a delta6 desaturase cdna
(cod6) and a delta6 elongase cdna (coe6) from c.
obscurus. expression of cod6 and coe6 in saccharomyces
cerevisiae revealed cod6 could introduce a delta6 double
bond into  xxxd2490xxx  (18:3n-3), and coe6 preferentially elongated 18-carbon delta6 desaturated fatty acid
stearidonic acid (18:4n-3). when the fungus was grown
under a temperature shift from 20°c to 10°c, the transcript
level of cod6 and coe6 increased, whereas when the
fungal culture was shifted from 20°c to 30°c, the transcript
level of both genes decreased. the entire eicosatetraenoic acid
biosynthetic pathway was reconstituted in yeast using four
genes, cod6 and coe6 from c. obscurus, cpdes12 (a delta12

introduction
the conidiobolus fungi are mainly found to inhabit soil or
decaying plant materials in tropical areas, particularly in
areas near the equator such as africa, india, and central
america. there are over 21 different species within the
genus, some of which have been found to be causative
agents in human infections, but the fungal species
conidiobolus obscurus is known to strictly infect insects
(scorsetti et al. 2007). as c. obscurus is particularly fond
of the aphid host, it has been used as bio-pesticides in
controlling the aphid population in various crops such as
potato, small grain, and cotton (feng et al. 1990; milner
and soper 1981; steinkraus and tugwell 1997). interestingly, this fungus is also able to produce substantial
amounts of very long chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
(vlcpufas) (tyrrell 1967). when the fungus infects the
host, it produces yeast-like hyphal bodies and wall-less
protoplasts. the protoplasts, unlike hyphal bodies, are not
recognized by the immune system of insects because of
the lack of beta-1,3 glucan in the cell walls (tanada and
kaye 1993). it appears that vlcpufas can inhibit the
synthesis of beta-1,3 glucan in the protoplasts, allowing the

592

appl microbiol biotechnol (2011) 90:591–601

fungus to evade the host immune system and to eventually
kill its host (mackichan et al. 1995).
vlcpufas such as  xxxd208xxx  (ara, 20:4n-6),
 xxxd2318xxx  (epa, 20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic
acid (dha, 22:6n-3) are essential  xxxd2154xxx  for human
health. dietary supplementations of these vlcpufas have
shown to provide protection against many chronic diseases
and to enhance function of the eyes and brain (napier 2006;
ratledge and wynn 2002; venegas-caleron et al. 2010).
currently, the main source of the omega3 vlcpufas are marine
fish. however, with the steady declining fish population in
oceans, the nutraceutical industry is now under intense
pressure to find alternative sources for these  xxxd2154xxx  to
meet the growing demand.
the biosynthesis of vlcpufas predominately proceeds
with the delta6 desaturation pathway in eukaryotes. for
instance, omega3 vlcpufas are synthesized in most fungi
first through sequential delta12 and omega3 desaturations of oleic
acid (18:1–9) resulting in  xxxd2490xxx  (ala, 18:3n-3),
which is followed by delta6 desaturation and delta6 elongation
giving rise to eicosatetraenoic acid (eta, 20:4n-3). eta is
desaturated by a delta5 desaturase producing epa. the
biosynthesis of omega6 vlcpufas occurs in a similar
process. the delta6 desaturation of linoleic acid (la,
18:2n-6) results in gamma- xxxd2490xxx  (gla, 18:3n-6),
which is followed by delta6 elongation and delta5 desaturation
producing ara (20:4–5,8,11,14).
eta (20:4–8,11,14,17) is a novel omega3 vclpufa that
has recently attracted scientific attention because it has the
unique chemical properties and biological activities, as well
as it is the precursor for the biosynthesis of downstream omega3
vlcpufas. however, no rich source of this fatty acid has
been found in nature. therefore, there is interest in
heterologous production of this fatty acid for nutraceutical
use. here, we report identification of a delta6 desaturase and a
delta6 elongase from an entomopathogenic fungus, c. obscurus,
involved in the biosynthesis of eta; the examination of their
expression under the different temperatures; and reconstitution
of the entire eta pathway in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae
using these genes.

gene expression analysis under different temperature
conditions
c. obscurus was first grown in 200 ml culture at 20°c for
5 days and the cells were then harvested and resuspended in
50 ml of the fresh medium. each 5 ml aliquot of the
suspension was added with 10 ml of the fresh medium.
samples were then incubated  xxxd1891xxx °c, 20°c and 30°c for
24 h. after that, the cells were collected by vacuum
filtration and washed twice with distilled water. total
rnas from the fungal samples were extracted using
trizol reagent (invitrogen, burlington, on, canada).
one microgram of total rna was treated with dnase i
and used for cdna synthesis using superscript iii
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) system (invitrogen, burlington, on, canada) in
20 mul reaction with random primers. the half mul of firststrand reaction was then used as a template for 25 mul
multiplex pcr reaction using taq dna polymerase
(ubi life sciences, saskatoon, sk, canada). the
specific primers lt53 (5′-atcttggtgcg catatag
c at g t g g t t c - 3 ′ ) a n d lt 5 9 ( 5 ′ - g g at c c t
taatcctgtttaggaggttcag-3′) were used to generate
a 565 bp cod6 cdna, primers lt60 (5′-gcggccgcat
tatggcctcagcagtttac-3′) and lt57 (5′-aaccac
cagacgccaaagatggagcag-3′) were used to generated a 608 bp delta6 elongase cdna (coe6) cdna. the 18s
rrna primer-competitor mix (universal 18s internal standard kit; ambion, applied biosystems, streetsville, on,
canada) was used for amplification of the internal control in
multiplex pcr experiments. the pcr conditions for both
multiplex pcr reactions were 25 cycles of 95°c for
30 s, 55°c for 30 s and 72°c for 40 s. a 10 mul aliquot of
both reactions was then analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel and
amplified products were quantified by the gel-documentation
system (alpha imager, hp system, santa clara, ca, usa).

the fungus strain and growth conditions
c. obscurus arsef74 was kindly provided by dr. richard
humber of robert w. holley center for agriculture and
health, ithaca, ny, 13853-2901, usa. to grow the fungus,
the mycelium was inoculated in a quarter strength of
sabourad dextrose media (10 g/l) containing 5 g/l
dextrose, 2.5 g/l bactopeptone and 2.5 g/l yeast extract,
and grown at room temperature (22°c) for 10 days with

total rna was extracted from the fungal biomass of c.
obscurus using trizol reagent and 5 mug of total rna was
used to synthesize first-strand cdna using the superscript

et al. 2002), cunninghamella echinulata (fakas et al. 2006)
and caenorhabditis elegans (napier et al. 1998). the
forward primer lt14 and the reverse primer lt16
correspond to the conserved regions w-f-h-g-g-l-q and
i-(a/e)-(d/k)-h-p-g-g, respectively. amplified products
with the expected size of approximately ∼1,000 bp were gel
purified, cloned into the pcr4-topo vector (invitrogen,
burlington, on, canada) and sequenced. the 5′ and 3′ ends
of the cod6 cdna were obtained by rapid amplification of
the cdna end (race) using a marathon cdna amplification kit (clontech, mountain view, ca, usa) following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. primers lt50 (5′agagttccatagcgttctcggaccaggc-3′) lt51
(5′-tgccatccacattgttgaaagaagagtcc-3′)
were used to obtain the 5′ end, while primers lt52 (5′tgggttgggggtcacttctttggagc-3′) and lt53
(5′-atcttggtgcgcatatagcatgtggttc-3′) were
used to obtain the 3′ end. the full-length cdna sequence,
including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions as well as the
coding region, was retrieved by rt-pcr using phusion
polymerase (new england biolabs, pickering, on, canada)
with the specific primers lt58 (5′-ggatccatcatgg
cacctcttactaac-3′) and lt59 (5′-ggatcct
taatcctgtttaggaggttcag-3′).
to isolate putative coe6, the degenerate oligonucleotide
primers lt5 (5′-ttyttncaygtntaycayca-3′) and
lt6 (5′-arraartartanccrtacat-3′) were designed
which correspond to the conserved amino acid regions f-lh-v-y-h-h and m-y-t-y-y-f-l-s of delta6 elongase enzymes
from m. alpina (parker-barnes et al. 2000), thalassiosira
pseudonana (meyer et al. 2004), phaeodactylum tricornutum (domergue et al. 2002), ostreococcus tauri (meyer et
al. 2004), p. patens (zank et al. 2000) and oncorhynchus
mykiss (meyer et al. 2004). amplified products with the
expected size of approximately 150 bp from degenerate rtpcr were gel purified, cloned into the pcr4-topo vector
and sequenced. the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coe6 cdna were
obtained by race using a marathon cdna amplification
kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations. primers
lt56 (5′-atcacgtggatgtaggagttaagggcag-3′)
and lt57 (5′-aaccaccagacgccaaagatggag

(5′-tcttccacgtctaccaccactgctcc-3′) and lt55
(5′-tcagctgcccttaactcctacatccacg-3′) were
used to obtain the 3′ end. the full-length sequence
including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions as well as the

593

coding region was retrieved by rt-pcr using phusion
polymerase with the specific primers lt60 (5′gcggccgcattatggcctcagcagtttac-3′) and
lt61 (5′-gcggccgcttagttgcgctttttgcca
tag-3′). the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for
cod6 and coe6 have been deposited in genbank under
accession numbers hq656805 and hq656806, respectively.
heterologous expression of cod6 and coe6 in yeast
to express the genes in yeast, the open reading frames were
inserted into the vector pyes2.1/v5-his-topo behind the
 xxxg853xxx   xxxg1321xxx  promoter. the recombinant plasmids were introduced into the yeast host s. cerevisiae invsc1 using the
lithium acetate transformation method (gietz et al. 1992).
the yeast transformants were first grown in a synthetic
yeast medium containing 2% glucose, 0.67% bacto-yeast
nitrogen base lacking uracil at 28°c for 2 days. the
cultures were then washed twice with distilled water and
resuspended in 10 ml of the induction medium (the
synthetic yeast medium containing 2% galactose instead
of 2% glucose) supplemented with or without 250 mum fatty
acid substrate in the presence of 0.1% tergitol. the induced
cultures were grown at 20°c for 2 days.
fatty acid analysis
the  xxxd2154xxx  of yeast cells were directly transmethylated
with 2 ml of 3 n methanolic hcl at 80°c for 1 h. after the
transmethylation process, the sample was cooled down at
room temperature before adding 1 ml of 0.9% nacl and
2 ml of hexane. the sample was then mixed and
centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for 5 min for phase separation.
hexane phase containing fatty acid methyl esters (fames)
were removed and dried under n2. after drying, the sample
was resuspended in 400 mul of hexane and placed in a gc
auto-sampler vial for gc analysis. two microliter of the
total fames sample was analyzed on an agilent 6890n
gas chromatograph equipped with a db-23 column with
0.25-mum-film thickness (j&w scientific). the column
temperature was maintained at 160°c for 1 min, and then
raised to 240°c at a rate of 4°c/min (reed et al. 2000). the
areas of chromatographic peaks were calculated for relative
amounts of fames. gc-ms analysis was accomplished
using an agilent 5973 mass selective detector coupled to an
agilent 6890n gas chromatograph with the same column
and conditions as described above. the mass selective
detector was run under standard electron impact conditions (70 ev), scanning an effective m/z range of 40–700
at 2.26 scans/s.
for fatty acid analysis of c. obscurus, the fungus was
grown in 40 ml of quarter strength of the sabouraud
medium at the room temperature (22°c) for 10 days. the

594

fungal cells was harvested through vacuum filtration and
washed twice with 20 ml of distilled water. the sample
was then mixed with 7 ml of 2:1 chloroform/methanol
(v/v) mixture and homogenized for 2 min. the homogenized solution was centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for 5 min. the
bottom lipid layer was carefully transferred into a new
tube and dried under a n2 stream. the dried lipid was
resuspended in an appropriate volume of chloroform to
achieve a final concentration of 20 mug/mul. to fractionate
the different lipid classes, the total lipid extract was
resolved on silica g-25 thin layer chromatography and
developed with hexane/ xxxd2052xxx /acetic acid (70:30:1,
vol/vol/vol) for neutral lipids and with chloroform/methanol/
acetic acid/water (100:40:12:2, vol/vol/vol/vol) for phospholipids, respectively. once the solvent front reached
approximately 2 cm from the top of the plate, the
developed plate was air dried and sprayed with the lipidstaining solution (5 mg primuline in 100 ml of 80:20
acetone/water [v/v]). lipid staining was observed under an
uv transluminator (aitzetmüller et al. 1992). in reference
to the lipid standard, the corresponding spots to each lipid
class were then scratched off the silica plate and directly
transmethylated as described above.
reconstruction of the eta pathway in yeast
to reconstitute the eta pathway, the cod6 gene flanked
with bamhi sites was first inserted in the yeast pesc-his
vector (stratagene) behind the  xxxg853xxx   xxxg1321xxx  promoter, while coe6
was cloned in the noti site of the vector behind the  xxxg471xxx 
promoter. the yeast co-expression vector pesc-ura
(stratagene) was used to clone cpdes12 and cpdesx
where cpdes12 was under the control of  xxxg853xxx   xxxg1321xxx  promoter
and cpdesx was under the control of the  xxxg471xxx  promoter.
to facilitate the cpdesx cloning process, bglii restriction
site was incorporated at the 5′ ends of the forward and
reverse primers, lt48 (5′-gaagatcttcgaaatggc
taacaaatctcc-3′) and lt49 (5′-gaagatcttcc
tagccgtgtgtgtggac-3′). these primers were then
used to amplify the full-length cpdesx; the amplified
product was digested with bglii and inserted into its
respective digested site within the pesc-ura vector. for
cloning cpdes12, the plasmid containing the gene was cut
with the restriction enzymes bamhi and ecori, and ligated
into the sites of pesc-ura. the two recombinant plasmids
expressing the four genes were co-transformed into s.
cerevisiae invsc1 using the lithium acetate transformation
method (gietz et al. 1992), the yeast transformants were
selected on a selection medium lacking histidine and uracil,
and containing 2% glucose. to assess the expression of the
reconstituted eta pathway, the transgenic yeast cells were
first grown in a synthetic yeast medium lacking histidine
and uracil and containing 2% glucose and 0.67% bacto-

yeast nitrogen base at 28°c for 2 days. the cultures were
then washed twice with distilled water and resuspended
with the induction medium (the synthetic yeast medium
containing 2% galactose). the induced cultures were
incubated at 15°c for 2 days, then at 20°c for 2 days.
following the induction, the yeast cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 2,400 rpm and washed once with
15 ml of 0.1% tergitol and twice with 10 ml of distilled
water.

results
fatty acid analysis of c. obscurus
c. obscurus, when grown under room temperature, could
produce substantial amounts of vlcpufas in triacylglycerol (tag) and phospholipid fractions, including both omega3
and omega6 vlcpufas such as epa (20:5n-3) and ara
(20:4n-6), two delta5 desaturated products of eta (20:4n-3)
and  xxxd1886xxx  ( xxxd1886xxx ,  xxxd1886xxx ), respectively. although ara and epa are not the predominate fatty
acids in the tag fraction, they were two major  xxxd2154xxx 
in the phospholipid fraction, together they made up approximately 40% of the total  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 1). as vlcpufas
were mostly located in the phospholipid fraction, the fatty
acid composition of two major phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (pc) and phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) were also
determined in the fungus. the result showed that pe
contains a higher level of ara and epa than pc (fig. s1
in supplementary data).
cloning and functional analysis of a delta6 desaturase gene
from c. obscurus
to clone the gene encoding cod6 from c. obscurus, a pair
of degenerate oligonucleotide primers was designed to the
well-conserved heme-binding site ((a/e)-(d/k)-h-p-g-g)
and the third histidine box (w-f-h-g-g-l-q) of several delta6
desaturases previously identified from other eukaryotes.
rt-pcr amplification with the degenerate primers using
the total rna as a template generated a cdna fragment of
about ∼1,000 bp long which showed high sequence
similarity to other delta6 desaturases. the race method was
then used to obtain the full-length cdna. the open reading
frame of the full-length cdna cod6 was 1,347 nucleotides
in length and encoded a 449 amino acid polypeptide with a
predicted molecular mass of 51.7 kda. comparison of the
cod6 protein with related sequences indicated it had 46%,
42%, and 40% of amino acid identity to delta6 desaturases
from m. alpina (huang et al. 1999), mucor circinelloides
(michinaka et al. 2003), and r. stolonifer (zhang et al.
2004), respectively.

to define the function of cod6, the orf was cloned
into a yeast expression vector pyes2.1 under the control of
 xxxg853xxx   xxxg1321xxx  promoter. the plasmid was transformed into s.
cerevisiae invsc1. selected transformants were grown in
the presence of linoleic acid, a know substrate for delta6
desaturase. fatty acid analysis showed that compared with
the control, transformants expressing cod6 in presence of
linoleic acid produced a new peak with the retention time
and mass spectrum identical to that of gla (18:3–6,9,12;
fig. 2), indicating cod6 coded for a functional delta6
desaturase which could introduce a delta6 double bond into
linoleic acid, giving rise to gla.
to determine the substrate specificity of cod6,
transformants were exogenously supplied with several
other  xxxd2154xxx  that differed in the number and
position of double bonds as well as in chain length.
the results from these feeding experiments showed that
the highest desaturation activity of cod6 was detected
on la and ala and similar desaturation efficiency
½ðproducts=ðsubstrates þ productsþ  % was observed
with these two substrates (15% and 16%, respectively).
in addition to introducing a delta6 double bond into la and
ala, cod6 could also, to a lesser extent, use 16:1–9 and
18:1–9 as substrates, producing 16:2–6,9 and 18:2–6,9,
respectively.
cloning and functional analysis of a delta6 elongase gene
from c. obscurus
the putative elongase gene from c. obscures (coe6) was
also cloned by using degenerate rt-pcr. two conserved
regions, the histidine rich motif (f-l-h-v-y-h-h) and the
tyrosine rich motif (m-y-t-y-y-f-l-s) found in several
delta6 elongases previously identified from fungi, algae and
animals were used to design two degenerate oligonucle-

otide primers for rt-pcr. degenerate rt-pcr produced
a ∼150-bp fragment with the total rna as the template,
which showed high sequence similarity to a delta6 elongase
from m. alpina (parker-barnes et al. 2000). the race
method was then used to obtain the full-length cdna. the
open-reading frame of the full-length cdna coe6 was
984 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 328 amino acids
with molecular weight of 37.3 kda. comparison of coe6
with other known delta6 elongases showed that it had high
amino acid identity to elongases from m. alpina (parkerbarnes et al. 2000; 52%), p. patens (zank et al. 2000;
41%), o. tauri (domergue et al. 2005; 40%), marchantia
polymorpha (kajikawa et al. 2004; 36%), and thraustochytrium sp. (wu et al. 2005; 39%).
to define the function of coe6, the orf was similarly
cloned into the yeast expression vector. the selected
transformants were grown in the presence of stearidonic
acid (sda, 18:4–6,9,12,15), a known substrate for delta6
elongase. fatty acid analysis showed that compared with
the control, transformants expressing coe6 in presence of
stearidonic acid produced a new peak with the same
retention time as eta. gc/ms analysis of this peak
confirmed it had the same mass spectrum as 20:4–
8,11,14,17, indicating that coe6 encoded a functional
elongase that could elongate stearidonic acid to eta
(fig. 3).
substrate specificity analysis indicated coe6 was able to
effectively elongate both gla and sda with high
elongation efficiency (50% and 60%, respectively). sda
was the most preferred substrate producing eta. besides,
coe6 could also, at a reduced efficiency, elongate 17:1–10
and 18:3–9,12,15 producing 19:1–12 and 20:3–11,14,17,
respectively. however, it could not elongate any very long
chain  xxxd2154xxx  (>18 c) such as 20:1–11,22:1–13,20:4–
5,8,11,14 and 20:5–5,8,11,14,17.

effect of the growth temperature on the gene expression
and fatty acid composition

reflected in the conversion efficiencies of both delta6 desaturation and delta6 elongation at three different temperatures.

to examine whether the growth temperature has any
effect on expression of the two genes, the transcript
levels of cod6 and coe6 from c. obscurus grown under
10°c, 20°c and 30°c are compared through a rt-pcr
method based on an internal standard. the result showed
that the growth temperature had significant impact on the
transcript level of the two genes. when the fungus was
grown  xxxd1891xxx °c, the transcript levels of both cod6 and
coe6 were increased, relative to those grown at 20°c. on
the other hand, when the fungus was grown at 30°c, the
transcript levels of both genes were decreased by dramatically
relative to those grown at 20°c (fig. 4). it was also noted that
the transcript change of the two genes under different
temperatures was generally correlated with the alteration of
fatty acid composition of the cell total lipids (table 1). the
total amount of vlcpufas was the highest when the
fungus was grown  xxxd1891xxx °c, which was followed by that at
20°c. the amount of vlcpufas was the lowest when the
fungus was grown at 30°c. this fatty acid variation was also

reconstitution of the entire eta pathway in yeast
yeast lacks both delta12-desaturase and omega3 desaturase
enzymes, thus is unable to produce la (18:2–9,12) and
ala (18:3–9,12,15), two precursors for delta6 desaturation
and subsequently delta6 elongation for the eta biosynthesis.
however, yeast naturally produces substantial amounts of
 xxxd2777xxx  (18:1–9), a precursor for la biosynthesis.
therefore, it was expected that by providing heterologous
delta12 desaturase, omega3 desaturase, delta6 elongase and delta6
desaturase, the transformant would be able to synthesize
eta without exogenous supplementation of any  xxxd2154xxx .
the entire eta pathway was therefore reconstituted by
expressing four genes simultaneously, cod6, coe6,
cpdes12 for a delta12 desaturase and cpdesx for a omega3
desaturase (meesapyodsuk et al. 2007). the fatty acid
analysis of transformants showed that compared with the
control, yeast expressing the four genes produced ten new
 xxxd2154xxx . the identity of these  xxxd2154xxx  was confirmed

discussion
previous reports have indicated entomopathogenic fungi
such as conidiobolus spp., entomophora spp. and batkoa
spp. could produce large amounts of vlcpufas (tyrrell
1967). five species of these entomopathogenic fungi were
thus selected for the analysis of their vlcpufas. the
results showed that all these fungi, particularly c. obscurus,
produced large amounts of vlcpufas such as arachidonic
acid and  xxxd2318xxx , which are downstream
products of delta6 desaturated and delta6 elongated products.
vlcpufas produced in this fungal species were mainly
found in phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas the storage neutral lipid triacylglycerol
contained a lower amount of vlcpufas. the biosynthesis
of vlcpufas involves alternating desaturation and elon-

of vlcpufas from c. obscurus. the delta6 desaturase cdna
cod6, when expressed in yeast, could introduce a double
bond at the sixth position of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic
acid. however, the desaturase activity appeared to be
relatively low in comparison to other previously characterized delta6 desaturases from fungi. the delta6 desaturated
products of two preferred substrates, linoleic acid and
 xxxd2490xxx  were in a range of 2–3% compared to 10% of
m. alpina delta6 desaturase (huang et al. 1999), 7.1% of m.
rouxii delta6 desaturase (laoteng et al. 2000), 6.0% of p.
irregulare delta6 desaturase (hong et al. 2002) under the
similar experimental condition. the delta6 elongase cdna
coe6, when expressed in yeast, could elongate two delta6
desaturated products gla and sda with the latter being
the most preferred substrate. it could not elongate any 20 c
vlcpufas such as ara and epa. this result was
manifested by phylogenetic analysis of coe6 with related
sequences, which indicated that the coe6 elongase was
clustered into the clade representing elongases specific for
the elongation of 18 c delta6 desaturated  xxxd2154xxx . this clade
of elongases were distantly separated from two other clades,
one clade comprised elongases specific for elongation of
saturated and mono-unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  and the other
consisted of elongases for elongation of both 18 c and 20 c
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. s2 in supplementary data).

gation. ara and epa are two delta5 desaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in
the n-6 and n-3 pathways. the delta5 desaturation producing
these two  xxxd2154xxx  is generally believed to occur in
phospholipids (domergue et al. 2003). therefore, a high
level vlcpufas accumulated in phospholipids rather than
in triacylglycerols may imply that c. obscurus has
developed an active system to synthesize these vlcpufas, but lack an efficient mechanism to channel these fatty
acids to the storage lipids.
polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  have been shown to play an
important role in sexual development and spore germination of several filamentous fungi. in neurospora sp., alphalinolenic acid stimulates formation of fruiting bodies
(nukina et al. 1981). in mucor sp., gamma- xxxd2490xxx  is
steadily increased during the germination process of spores
(laoteng et al. 2000) where the delta6 desaturase gene
responsible for the biosynthesis of the fatty acid is highly
expressed (khunyoshyeng et al. 2002). c. obscurus has
been used as bio-pesticides to control aphids from crops. it
is believed vlcpufas in the entomopathogenic fungi may
have a role in initial infection of the host (mackichan et al.
1995). however, the exact mechanism underlying the
process still needs to be defined.
in this study, degenerate rt-pcr and race methods
were employed to clone genes involved in the biosynthesis

the variation in the gene expression of cod6 and coe6
and fatty acid composition was observed when the fungus
was grown under different temperatures (fig. 4). the
transcript level of both cod6 and coe6 was the highest
when the fungus was grown  xxxd1891xxx °c, which was followed
by those at 20°c and at 30°c. this expression pattern was
generally correlated with fatty acid compositions of the
fungus grown under these temperature conditions. vlcpufas in the fungus were the most abundant when grown at
10°c and with the growth temperature increased, the
amount of vlcpufas were concurrently reduced. these
results suggest that vlcpufas might play an important
role in acclimation of the fungus to the temperature shift.
when the fungus grew at the lower temperature, the
increased vlcpufas in membrane lipids would be helpful
in maintaining the membrane fluidity and preventing it
from the cold damage. the increased long chain unsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  have been previously observed in improving the
cold stress in plants (upchurch 2008; welti et al. 2002). the
change in unsaturated fatty acid levels has also been
observed in s. cerevisiae (nakagawa et al. 2002) where the
increased desaturation of cellular  xxxd2154xxx  in cold
adaptation is mediated by a transcription factor mga2p that
contributes to the transduction of low-temperature signals for
the activation of the delta9 desaturase. in synechocystis sp., the
signal transduction for the fatty acid desaturation at low
temperature is monitored by a “two-component system”
composed of a membrane-associated kinase as the signal
acceptor (thermosensor) and a response regulator activated
upon phosphorylation (suzuki et al. 2000). the biosynthesis

599

of very long chain unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (≥20 c) and long
chain unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (16–18 c) is different in
microbes. whether the regulation of the vlcpufa biosynthesis in response to the temperature shift shares similar
mechanisms remains to be determined.
very long chain omega3  xxxd2154xxx  have been shown to have
many health benefits, some of which include lowering
blood pressure, providing protection against cardiovascular
diseases and improving brain and eye functions. so far,
there are several groups who have attempted to reconstitute
the vlcpufa biosynthetic pathway in yeast (beaudoin et
al. 2000; domergue et al. 2003) as well as in plants
(abbadi et al. 2004; qi et al. 2002; wu et al. 2005). in
yeast, beaudoin et al. (2000) produced epa in presence of
ala using a c. elegans delta6 elongase, a m. alpina delta5
desaturase and a borage delta6 desaturase. domergue et al.
(2002) produced epa using a different set of three enzymes
in presence of ala. meyer et al. (2004) reconstituted the
dha biosynthetic pathway in yeast starting with the delta6
elongation step. in all these cases, an exogenous fatty acid
was supplied to the yeast transformants for the production
of very long chain omega3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . the
reconstitution of the entire biosynthetic pathway of  xxxd1886xxx ,
an omega6 vlcpufa in s. cerevisiae was previously reported
using a yeast kluyveromyces lactis delta12 desaturase, a rat
delta6 desaturase and a rat delta6 elongase without supplementation of any foreign  xxxd2154xxx  (yazawa et al. 2007). to
our knowledge, there is still no report so far describing the
reconstitution of the entire omega3 vlcpufa pathway in the
absence of exogenous  xxxd2154xxx  in yeast s. cerevisiae. this
report for the first time describes the reconstitution of the
entire eta pathway by co-expressing four genes simultaneously without supplementation of any exogenous substrate.
while the entire eta pathway was successfully reconstituted in yeast, the level of the final product eta is still
low, accounting for about 0.1% of the total  xxxd2154xxx .
many factors could affect the yield of the final product in a
reconstituted metabolic pathway. this may include the
activity of the transgene per se, the choice of the host
expression system, the activity of a promoter used to
control the transgene, and growing condition of transformants. comparison of conversion efficiencies in each
enzymatic step of the reconstituted eta pathway in yeast
revealed that the bottleneck of the reconstituted pathway is
the delta6 desaturation where the conversion efficiency is only
about 6%, far from that of the delta6 elongation (∼50%). part
of the reason for the low delta6 desaturation could be attributed
to the relatively low activity of cod6. however, comparison of conversion efficiencies between the single-gene
functional analysis and the four-gene reconstitution showed
that the coe6 elongase in the reconstituted pathway was
able to keep similar elongation efficiency (50–60%) as in
the functional analysis, whereas the cod6 desaturase was

600

unable to do the same, the delta6 desaturation efficiency was
reduced from 15% in the single-gene functional analysis to
about 6% in the reconstituted pathway. it has been shown
by previous studies that the major obstacle in reconstitution
of a vlcpufa pathway in heterologous systems such as
yeast and plant is substrate availability. it is generally
believed that the desaturation and elongation involved in
the biosynthesis of vlcpufas often occur in different
lipid pools (abbadi et al. 2004; domergue et al. 2003).
the elongase usually uses acyl-coa as substrate, while
most desaturases use glycerolipids as substrates (lopez
alonso et al. 2003), although a few desaturases that can
uses acyl-coa as substrate have recently been identified in
microalgae (domergue et al. 2005; hoffmann et al. 2008).
if desaturases and elongase in the metabolic pathway do
not share the same pool of substrates, the vlcpufa
biosynthesis would be less efficient (abbadi et al. 2004;
domergue et al. 2003). at the moment, we do not have
information regarding the substrate form for cpdesx and
cod6 used in the eta reconstitution. if cpdesx does not
share the same form of substrates as cod6, the subsequent
delta6 desaturation by cod6 could be affected by ineffective
channeling of the acyl substrates. the more effective
desaturation of the reconstituted vlcpufa pathways in
plants than in yeast (cheng et al. 2010; kaijikawa et al.
2008) might be also due to the substrate availability in the
host system used.
