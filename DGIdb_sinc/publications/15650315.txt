abstract
background:  xxxd2995xxx , a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor
1 ( xxxg599xxx ) antagonist, inhibits not only airway smooth
muscle contraction, but also allergic inflammation. the
aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of
 xxxd2995xxx -induced  xxxg1180xxx  ( xxxg1180xxx ) inhibition in allergic inflammation. methods: surgically resected human
lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with miteallergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with
mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with  xxxd2995xxx , dexamethasone, or both. the  xxxg1180xxx  protein level in
the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of  xxxg1180xxx  and  xxxg599xxx  mrna was performed using
lung tissues. results: pretreatment of lung tissues with
 xxxd2995xxx  alone significantly decreased the amount of
 xxxg1180xxx  protein in the culture medium by 40%. the combination of  xxxd2995xxx  and dexamethasone synergistically
enhanced this effect. quantitative in situ hybridization
with image analysis revealed abundant expression of

 xxxg1180xxx  mrna in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells
in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues.
 xxxg599xxx  mrna was detected in macrophages, smooth
muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less
expressed in lymphocytes.  xxxd2995xxx -induced inhibition
of  xxxg1180xxx  mrna expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their  xxxg599xxx  mrna expression status. in
addition, cysteinyl leukotrienes per se failed to upregulate the  xxxg1180xxx  production. conclusion: our results indicate
that  xxxd2995xxx  inhibits  xxxg1180xxx  synthesis via a mechanism
distinct from  xxxg599xxx  antagonism.

introduction

bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of
the airways [1], characterized by infiltration of a variety of
inflammatory cells. in the past, bronchorelaxation was the
main therapy for bronchial asthma. however, recent
international guidelines for asthma have recommended
early intervention against airway inflammation by antiinflammatory drugs, such as inhaled steroids [2].

 xxxd2995xxx , originally developed as a leukotriene receptor antagonist [3], became available in 1995. the primary physiological action of leukotrienes includes smooth
muscle contraction [4]. the antagonists of leukotriene
receptors have been in clinical use and recommended in
international guidelines [2], and their clinical efficacy has
been reported [5]. in fact, in vivo antagonism of leukotrienes by  xxxd2995xxx  resulted in both bronchorelaxation
and attenuation of allergic inflammation and eosinophil
infiltration [6]. since leukotrienes exhibited chemotaxis
for eosinophils [7], it is possible that  xxxd2995xxx  also
inhibits this chemotactic action.
the allergic inflammation in asthma is known to be
associated with a high expression of th2-type cytokines,
such as interleukins (ils) 4 and 5. underwood et al. [8]
have shown the involvement of  xxxg1180xxx  in the inhibition of
eosinophil infiltration by  xxxd2995xxx  in the guinea pig.
however, the mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect
in human asthma remains obscure.
in the present study, we evaluated the effect of  xxxd2995xxx  on allergen-stimulated  xxxg1180xxx  production by using in
vitro culture of passively sensitized human lung tissues
resected from lung cancer patients. the amount of  xxxg1180xxx  in
the culture media was determined by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. to identify the cells that express
 xxxg1180xxx  mrna and protein in the cultured lung tissues, we
performed in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. finally, we examined the expression of
 xxxg599xxx  ( xxxg599xxx ) mrna to discriminate  xxxd2995xxx -sensitive and  xxxd2995xxx -insensitive
cells.

materials and methods
materials
lung tissue specimens were obtained surgically from 23 patients
undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer at the nagasaki university
hospital. the patients were 12 men and 11 women, aged 40–85 years
(mean b sd 63.7 b 12.4 years). no patients had bronchial asthma,
and 18 patients were current smokers. no patients were treated with
anticancer drugs or irradiation prior to surgery. lung and serum
donors were not taking steroids or  xxxd2995xxx . the study was
approved by the ethics committee of the nagasaki university, and
written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
preparation of tissue sections and experimental protocol
macroscopically normal lung tissues were prepared as described
previously [9]. after removing the pleura, a tissue section weighing
approximately 200 mg was placed into physiological saline and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 ° c to remove erythrocytes. sera
obtained from asthmatics having a radioallergosorbent test score 1 5
were diluted five times with rpmi 1640 medium (gibco brl life

technologies, grand island, n.y., usa), and passive sensitization
was performed by incubating the tissue in rpmi with the sera for 2 h
at 37 ° c. after pretreatment with  xxxd2995xxx  (10 –8 to 10 –5 m ) and
dexamethasone (10 –8 to 10 –6 m) at 37 ° c for 2 h, the tissue was stimulated with 1.5 ìg/ml of dermatophagoides farinae allergen (lsl,
chicago, ill., usa), and the culture medium was collected 8 and 24 h
after the stimulation. in addition, tissues were harvested 8 or 24 h
after stimulation and examined histologically. stimulation with leukotriene d4 or leukotriene e4 (10 –8 to 10 –6 m; cayman chemical,
ann arbor, mich., usa) was also performed at 37 ° c for 24 h.
quantitative determination of the protein concentrations in the
culture medium
the  xxxg1180xxx  levels in the culture medium were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the human  xxxg1180xxx  immunoassay kit (quantikine; r&d systems, minneapolis, minn., usa)
and expressed per 1 g wet weight of lung tissue.
tissue processing
stimulated tissues were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) at room temperature
and embedded in paraffin. sections (4 ìm thick) were mounted on
aminopropyl-triethoxy-silane-coated glass slides. serial sections were
prepared, and one section was used for in situ hybridization, while
the other was used for immunohistochemistry performed for cell
identification.
in situ hybridization
the expression levels of  xxxg1180xxx  mrna and  xxxg599xxx  mrna were
then determined by in situ hybridization as described previously
[10]. the endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited after deparaffinization, and the lung tissue was treated with 0.2 n hcl and 0.2%
triton x-100 and digested with 10 ìg/ml proteinase k. after postfixation with 4% paraformaldehyde/pbs, the sections were immersed
twice in 2 mg/ml glycine in pbs and stored in 40% deionized formamide in 4! ssc until used for hybridization. hybridization was
performed overnight at 37 ° c using digoxigenin-labeled synthetic  xxxg1180xxx  and  xxxg599xxx  antisense oligo-dnas as detection probes (table 1).
after washing three times with 50% formamide, 2! ssc, and
0.075% brij 35 for 1 h each and then washing twice for 1 h each in
50% formamide, 0.5! ssc, and 0.075% brij 35, the slides were
immersed in a blocking solution (5% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 500 ìg/
ml normal sheep igg, 100 ìg/ml yeast trna, 100 ìg/ml salmon
sperm dna, and 0.3 m nacl for ltr and 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx , normal mouse igg, 100 ìg/ml yeast trna, 100 ìg/ml salmon
sperm dna, and nacl for 28s rrna) for 1 h. the lung tissue was
reacted overnight with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody for  xxxg1180xxx  and  xxxg599xxx  and with horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-t-t dimer antibody for 28s rrna. after washing
with pbs, the horseradish peroxidase-stained sites were visualized
with 0.05% 3,3)-diaminobenzidine and 0.01% h2o2 together with
0.02% niso4 (nh4)2so4 and 0.025% cocl2 for 10 min according to
the method of adams [11].
control experiments
to confirm the specificity of  xxxg1180xxx  and  xxxg599xxx  mrna signals,
we conducted various types of control experiments concurrently with
the test experiments. the sense probe was used as a negative control
in every run. to evaluate the level of hybridizable rnas in tissue
sections, 28s rrna probe was used as a positive control on every

antisense probe in the presence of an excess amount of either homologous or heterologous unlabeled oligo-dna to provide definitive evidence of the sequence specificity of the signal as described previously
in detail [10].
immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemistry was performed by the indirect enzymelabeled antibody method. the primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry are listed in table 2. for lymphocyte detection, sections were treated with trypsin to enhance their antigenicity. visualization of horseradish peroxidase-labeled sites was performed with
diaminobenzidine and h2o2.
image analysis
for quantitative analysis of the mrna expression, we used an
image analyzer (ks-run; carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany). the
expression of mrna was numerically classified into 256 levels and
expressed as the following equation: [(value obtained by antisense
probe – value obtained by sense probe)/value obtained by 28s rrna]
! 100 (%). moreover, the expression level was divided into five
grades (630, 20–30, 10–20, 5–10, and ^5). depending on the grade,
pseudocolors such as red, green, and blue were given, i.e., 630 = red,
20–30 = green, 5–10 = blue, and ^5 = no color.

effect of  xxxd2995xxx  on the  xxxg1180xxx  protein concentration
in culture medium
to assess the effect of  xxxd2995xxx  on the production of
 xxxg1180xxx  in allergen-stimulated lung tissue, we analyzed the
level of  xxxg1180xxx  in the culture medium, where the passively
sensitized lung tissue was stimulated with d. farinae allergen in the presence or absence of various drugs. without
stimulation with d. farinae allergen,  xxxg1180xxx  was not detected in the culture medium. as shown in figure 1, treatment with  xxxd2995xxx   xxxd1891xxx  –5 m significantly decreased
the amount of  xxxg1180xxx  protein in the culture medium. furthermore, dexamethasone significantly decreased the
amount of  xxxg1180xxx  protein in a dose-dependent manner when
used at 110 –7 m (p ! 0.01). moreover, the combination of
10 –6 or 10 –7 m  xxxd2995xxx  and 10 –8 m dexamethasone
significantly decreased  xxxg1180xxx  protein in the culture medium as compared with the effect of each drug alone
(fig. 1). on the other hand,  xxxg1180xxx  protein was not detected
in the culture medium, when the lung tissue was cultured
in the presence of leukotriene d4 or e4  xxxd1891xxx  –6 m for 24 h
(data not shown).

colocalization was confirmed by immunohistochemistry,
and  xxxg1180xxx  mrna expression was found in eosinophils,
mast cells, lymphocytes, and type ii alveolar cells by in
situ hybridization (fig. 2a–e). pretreatment of lung tissues
with dexamethasone markedly decreased the  xxxg1180xxx  mrna
signal intensity. although the signal intensity was also significantly decreased in lung tissues pretreated with  xxxd2995xxx , the extent of the decrease was smaller than that
observed after pretreatment with dexamethasone. inhibition of the  xxxg1180xxx  mrna expression by  xxxd2995xxx  and
dexamethasone was observed in all types of cells (fig. 3d
and f, respectively). localization of  xxxg1180xxx  protein in the

in the next experiments, we performed in situ hybridization to identify the cells that expressed  xxxg599xxx  in the
cultured lung tissues and immunohistochemistry for colocalization. in situ hybridization revealed  xxxg599xxx 
mrna expression in macrophages, smooth muscle cells,
eosinophils, mast cells, and type ii alveolar cells (fig. 4a–

following d. farinae allergen stimulation. the  xxxg599xxx 
mrna expression did not change significantly by pretreatment with  xxxd2995xxx  and dexamethasone (fig. 4c

quantitative analysis of  xxxg1180xxx  and  xxxg599xxx  mrnas
the results of quantitative evaluation of  xxxg1180xxx  mrna
and  xxxg599xxx  mrna expression (image analysis) are
summarized in table 3. the effect of  xxxd2995xxx  on the
allergen-induced  xxxg1180xxx  production in the cells of lung tissues did not correlate with the expression of  xxxg599xxx 
mrna.

discussion

the major findings of the present study were as follows: (1)  xxxd2995xxx , a  xxxg599xxx  antagonist, inhibited the
d. farinae allergen-induced  xxxg1180xxx  production in passively
sensitized human lung parenchyma both at mrna and
protein levels; (2)  xxxg599xxx  per se did not induce  xxxg1180xxx 
production in the lung tissue in vitro, and (3)  xxxd2995xxx 
inhibited the  xxxg1180xxx  production from a variety of cells, irrespective of the  xxxg599xxx  expression. these results suggest
that  xxxd2995xxx  plays an anti-inflammatory role not
through the  xxxg599xxx  antagonism.
since  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited the  xxxg1180xxx  expression in lung
tissues at both mrna and protein levels, it appears to
inhibit  xxxg1180xxx  synthesis rather than its secretion. it has also
been reported that  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited the production of
 xxxg1180xxx , il-4, and  xxxg526xxx  by human peripheral monocytes  xxxd1891xxx  –5 m [13].
these findings suggest that  xxxd2995xxx  may have nonspecific and broad anti-inflammatory effects, similar to those
of steroids.
interestingly, although  xxxd2995xxx  inhibited the  xxxg1180xxx 
production,  xxxg599xxx  per se failed to induce  xxxg1180xxx  production. we found that mast cells expressed the highest levels
of  xxxg1180xxx  mrna in the allergen-stimulated lung tissue, followed by lymphocytes, eosinophils, and type ii alveolar
cells, whereas a high  xxxg599xxx  mrna expression was
observed in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and eosinophils, followed by mast cells and type ii alveolar cells.
the  xxxg1180xxx  production by each cell type was similarly inhibited by  xxxd2995xxx , even in lymphocytes which did not
express  xxxg599xxx  mrna. in agreement with the present
results, tohda et al. [13] also reported that  xxxd2995xxx  significantly inhibited the  xxxg1180xxx  production from human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, probably lymphocytes. taken together, these findings indicate that  xxxd2995xxx  exhibits an additional action, distinct from its
originally described pharmacological effects through
 xxxg599xxx . it does not simply mean that it acts through the
other known  xxxg599xxx , i.e., cysltr2, since  xxxd2995xxx 
does not block cysltr2 [14], which is expressed in

170

int arch allergy immunol 2005;136:165–172

peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph nodes, spleen, heart,
several central nervous system regions, and adrenal gland,
and one of the cysltr2 responses is neutrophilic infiltration by eliciting il-8. to date, it is not clear whether this
effect represents a unique activity of  xxxd2995xxx . recently, we reported [15] that other  xxxg599xxx  antagonists,  xxxd3545xxx  and montelukast, as well as  xxxd2995xxx , significantly inhibited the  xxxg2296xxx  alpha production
from human peripheral blood monocytes. in contrast,
 xxxd2995xxx  inhibited  xxxg681xxx -induced
dna synthesis in human airway smooth muscle cells,
while  xxxd3545xxx  did not [16]. thus, further studies are
needed to determine whether  xxxd3545xxx  and montelukast
also inhibit the  xxxg1180xxx  production from human lung tissue.
in contrast to  xxxg1180xxx , it has been reported that leukotrienes
release il-13, another th2 cytokine, into murine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [17–20]. considered together
with our results, these findings suggest that  xxxd2995xxx 
could differentially regulate the th2 cytokine production
in the asthmatic airway, wherein  xxxg1180xxx  is inhibited via
receptors other than  xxxg599xxx , and il-13 is inhibited via
 xxxg599xxx .
a relatively recent study [21] showed that  xxxg1180xxx  was primarily produced from activated lymphocytes after antigenic stimulation in an in vivo rat model. in contrast, in
our study, the highest expression of  xxxg1180xxx  mrna was
detected in mast cells. these differences probably reflect
the various experimental conditions. we used the culture
system of resected human lung tissues in this study, and,
therefore, inflammatory cells did not accumulate in the
local pulmonary region of the circulation. a recent study
[22] showed that  xxxg599xxx  is regulated by transforming
growth factor beta and il-13 [22]. our experimental
design suggests that local changes in human lung tissue
occur immediately after allergen stimulation, thus excluding any systemic effects. while the present study is limited, since the results do not reflect the underlying airway
inflammation typically seen in asthmatics, our experimental design, on the other hand, is advantageous, as it
allowed to uncover an important phenomenon without
the complexities of the inflammatory process.
in the present study, the combination of dexamethasone and  xxxd2995xxx  synergistically inhibited the  xxxg1180xxx  production. similar findings have been reported in vivo [23].
namely, when asthmatic patients were treated with an
inhaled steroid (beclomethasone) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) singly after allergen challenge, the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid was significantly decreased as compared with
untreated patients. however, eosinophils persisted in the

fukushima et al.

airways of the treated patients. in contrast, eosinophils
almost disappeared in the airways following treatment of
these patients with a combination of beclomethasone and
montelukast.
glucocorticoids are believed to inhibit the inflammatory cytokine production via inhibition of activator protein 1 and nuclear factor kappa b. since  xxxd2995xxx  also
inhibits the allergen-induced nuclear factor kappa b nuclear translocation in human peripheral blood monocytes
[15] and in a murine model of allergic asthma [24], there
may be a cross talk between the glucocorticoids and  xxxd2995xxx  at the transcription factor level, e.g., via nuclear
factor kappa b. of course, considering that glucocorticoids (which have a strong inhibitory activity on the cytokine production) do not inhibit the leukotriene production [25], both inhaled steroids and antileukotriene agents
can be important medications, in accordance with the
international guidelines for asthma treatment. more importantly, the present results indicate that further significant therapeutic benefits can be expected by combining
these agents.
the sequence of  xxxg599xxx  was successfully cloned in
1999, and the mrna expression was observed in smooth

muscle cells, airway epithelia, and pulmonary macrophages [26]. thereafter, other studies have demonstrated
the presence of leukotriene receptors in mast cells [27],
eosinophils, and neutrophils [28]. in this study, we confirmed that macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, mast cells, and type ii alveolar cells were positive
for  xxxg599xxx  mrna. furthermore, we demonstrated for
the first time that the level of  xxxg599xxx  mrna expression was increased in the sensitized lung tissue after allergen stimulation. in the clinical setting, patients with bronchial asthma are clearly divided into two groups: patients
who respond well to leukotriene antagonists and those
who do not. it would be very interesting to know whether
the level of  xxxg599xxx  mrna expression is different
between these two groups.
in conclusion, our findings here indicate that  xxxd2995xxx  inhibits the  xxxg1180xxx  production via unknown receptors
and attenuates allergic airway inflammation. the combination of  xxxd2995xxx  and steroids showed a synergistic
inhibitory effect on the  xxxg1180xxx  production. these results
support the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2995xxx  for the treatment of asthma. further research is required to determine
the molecular mechanisms of its actions.
