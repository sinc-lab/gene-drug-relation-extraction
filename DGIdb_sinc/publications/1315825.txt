objective:  xxxd419xxx  (uk 79,300) is an orally available inhibitor of the neutral
endopeptidase (e.c.3.4.24.11) which degrades atrial natriuretic factor (anf). this study
was designed to establish initial safety and efficacy data in essential hypertension for
this novel class of drug.

design: a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose comparison of
 xxxd419xxx  with placebo in a crossover manner. three doses of  xxxd419xxx  (10, 50
and 200 mg) were used, with four subjects at each dose level.

setting: the medical research council blood pressure unit, western infirmary, glasgow,
uk (a hospital clinical research unit).

patients: twelve patients with untreated essential hypertension. diastolic blood pressure
was >95 mmhg on three separate occasions before entry to the study.

intervention:  xxxd419xxx  or matching placebo was administered orally in the fasting
state. serial measurements of urinary volume and electrolyte excretion were taken (on
each hour, urine volume was replaced with an equivalent volume of water by mouth).
blood pressure and heart rate were recorded for 12h after drug administration and
serial blood samples were taken for measurement of plasma anf and neurohormone
concentrations.

main outcome measures: urine volume and electrolyte concentration; blood pressure;
heart rate; plasma atrial natriuretic factor.

results: plasma anf concentrations rose significantly in all patients within 2h of  xxxd419xxx 
administration compared with placebo although peak and integrated anf levels were
similar at all three doses. a significant natriuresis was only seen after 200 mg  xxxd419xxx ,
with a greater cumulative urine sodium excretion over 12h compared with placebo,
this was associated with a greater diuresis over 12h compared with placebo. after a
single oral dose of  xxxd419xxx , blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged.

conclusions:  xxxd419xxx  in a single dose caused no adverse effects in essential hyper-
tension. the drug caused a rise in basal anf levels at all doses, but natriuresis was only seen
with the highest dose used. no change in blood pressure was recorded after acute dosing and
the results of chronic studies with this compound are awaited. oral inhibitors of anf
degradation may have therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disorders.

[6,7]. however, the therapeutic usefulness of exoge-
nous anf is limited by its lack of oral bioavailability.

an alternative approach would be to achieve pharma-
cological elevation of endogenous anf levels by in-
hibiting clearance of the peptide. anf is inactivated
both by enzymatic degradation by the neutral en-
dopeptidase e.c.3.4.24.11 (nep) and by binding to
clearance receptors [8,9]. inhibition of nep activity
by + xxxd420xxx  (uk 69,578, a racemic preparation;
pfizer central research, sandwich, kent, uk) prolongs
the half-life of anf in animals and this is associated
with increased urinary volume and sodium excretion
[10]. we have previously shown that iv. administra-
tion of +  xxxd420xxx  in normal man and in patients
with cardiac failure raises plasma anf and causes natri-
uresis and diuresis [11].  xxxd419xxx  (uk 79,300) is an
orally bioavailable prodrug of this compound, being
the indanyl ester of uk 73,967, the active enantiomer
of + xxxd420xxx .

in this preliminary study of  xxxd419xxx , the aims were
to establish the safety of administration in patients with
essential hypertension, to assess the oral bioavailability
of this novel agent in man, and to give limited data on
efficacy and dose response.

methods

 

twelve patients with untreated essential hypertension
(11 males, 1 female; mean age, 43 years) were given
a single dose of  xxxd419xxx  in a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion, with the
two phases at least 7 days apart. before entry to
the study, supine diastolic blood pressure (dbp) was

295 mmhg on each of three measurements taken on
2 separate days in all subjects; secondary causes of
hypertension were excluded by a full physical exam-
ination and screening blood tests. details of the sub-
jects studied are shown in table 1. patients gave their
written informed consent before participation in the
study, which was approved by the local ethical com-
mittee.

patients were admitted to hospital on the morning of
the study after overnight fasting. dietary electrolyte in-
take was not controlled before either phase of the
study. an iv. cannula (venflon, viggo, helsinborg,
sweden) was inserted into a forearm vein for blood
sampling. after emptying their bladders, patients were
given an oral water load of 400 ml; for the next 13h,
at hourly intervals, urine was collected, the volume
measured and aliquots taken for estimation of sodium
and potassium and for pharmacokinetic analysis. urine
loss was replaced at the end of every hour by an equiv-
alent oral volume of tap water.

after a 2-h equilibration phase,  xxxd419xxx  or placebo
was administered in  xxxd3449xxx  to a final volume of
125 ml. the first four patients received 10 mg, the next
four 50 mg and the final four 200 mg. blood samples
were taken 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8h after dosing for haematol-
ogy, serum biochemistry, plasma active renin concen-
tration, aldosterone and anf measurements; samples
for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at these same
times, with additional samples at 0.5 and 1.5h. supine
and standing blood pressure were measured before
drug administration and at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12h, using a
semi-automated sphygmomanometer (copal, takeda,
tokyo, japan [12] ). patients remained supine through-
out the study, except to pass urine and for measure-
ment of standing blood pressure.

patients were allowed home 12h after drug adminis-
tration and were reviewed at 24 and 96h when blood
pressure was measured and blood sampling repeated
after 30 min supine rest.

assays

plasma active renin and aldosterone concentrations
were measured using methods described elsewhere
[13,14]. blood samples for analysis of anf were col-
lected in chilled tubes containing 100 [u/ml aprotonin.
anf was measured by radioimmunoassay, with pre-
extraction of plasma samples [15]. the intra-assay co-
efficient of variation at 100 pg/ml was 3.8% and the
mean interassay value was 3.5%. mean recovery of
anf from plasma extraction was 92.4%. all measure-
ments (active and placebo) from each subject were
measured in a single assay run. full blood count was
measured using a coulter counter (coulter, hialeah,
florida, usa). serum electrolytes and liver enzymes
were measured by autoanalyser and urine electrolytes
by flame photometry.

concentration of  xxxd420xxx  (the active metabolite
of  xxxd419xxx ) in plasma and urine was estimated
by an assay dependent upon the ability of nep to
hydrolyse 14c-hippuryl-phenylalanyl-arginine to hip-
puric acid and phenylalanyl-arginine [10]. the amount
of radiolabelled hippuric acid is inversely related to the
log concentration of  xxxd420xxx .

statistical analysis

statistical analysis was achieved using analysis of vari-
ance comparing active and placebo groups, and by us-
ing dunnett’s procedure to test differences between
dose groups and placebo [16]. summary statistics
were adjusted for subject and period effects and for
baseline variation where appropriate.

results

 

all patients completed the study and no adverse effects
were observed during active or placebo phases.

anf levels rose in all subjects within 2h of can-
doxatril administration when compared with placebo
(p< 0.001). plasma anf concentrations remained ele-

vated at 4h and values did not return to baseline until
8h postdose (fig. 1). when analysed by area under the
curve as calculated by the trapezoidal rule, the mean
increase in plasma anf (integrated anf over 8h after
treatment) was 125.5 pg/h per ml after 10 mg candox-
atril, 111.2 pg/h per ml after 50 mg and 121.8 pg/h per
mi after 200 mg (table 2).

there was a trend towards suppression of plasma ac-
tive renin concentration for up to 8h after treatment
with 200 mg  xxxd419xxx  (p = 0.08), with an apparent
rise in renin at 24h (fig. 3). a similar trend was ob-
served for plasma aldosterone (data not shown).

following a single oral dose of  xxxd419xxx , there were
no significant changes in supine or standing blood
pressure (table 3). no changes in supine or standing
heart rate were seen for any dose of the drug (data
not shown).

pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma samples con-
firmed that peak concentrations of  xxxd420xxx  were
reached in all patients within 1.3-1.5h of candoxa-
tril administration. the half-life of the disappearance
of  xxxd420xxx  from plasma did not differ signifi-
cantly between dose groups (table 4), renal excretion
was confirmed; the maximal urine concentration was
found within 13h of drug administration, although
 xxxd420xxx  was still detectable at 12h.

discussion

 

this is the first controlled study in hypertensive hu-
man subjects of the effects of an orally bioavailable
inhibitor of the enzyme which breaks down ane.
nep inactivates anf by cleaving the cys,9s—phe,o¢ and
ser}23-phe;24 bonds and disrupting the peptide ring
structure. the enzyme is widely distributed in man
and is present in high concentration in the brush bor-
der of the proximal tubule of the kidney as well as
in the central nervous system and lung [8]. inhibition
of nep activity by a number of different compounds
has been shown to prolong the half-life of exogenous
anf in experimental animals and to cause natriuresis

and diuresis [17-20]. we have previously shown that
iv. administration of a potent and specific inhibitor of
nep, +  xxxd420xxx  (uk 69,578), in normal human
subjects causes plasma anf levels to rise and results
in a marked increase in renal sodium excretion [11].
richards et al [21] have recently shown that oral ad-
ministration of  xxxd419xxx  to normal man causes na-
triuresis and diuresis. the present study was designed
to give information about the absorption and safety
of this novel compound in hypertensive humans, and
only limited information on dose range and efficacy
were anticipated. the drug was well absorbed, with
peak plasma levels of  xxxd420xxx  occurring 1.5 h af-
ter oral administration of  xxxd419xxx  and a terminal
elimination half-life of 1.6h.  xxxd419xxx  was well tol-
erated in all subjects, with no reported side effects.

plasma anf levels rose after administration of candox-
atril at > 10mg doses. although the numbers studied
for each dose were small, there was no evidence that
administration of doses >10 mg resulted in a greater
increase in either peak plasma anf levels or in the
integrated plasma anf response over several hours
(as measured by area below the curve), basal concen-
trations of anf were not significantly different in the
three groups of patients studied (table 1), and the fail-
ure to observe a dose-response relationship was not
a consequence of baseline variability. studies with the
iv. preparation -+  xxxd420xxx  showed a similar lack
of a clear dose-response relationship for peak plasma

anf levels [11]. the peak plasma concentrations of
 xxxd420xxx  in the present study were greater than
the half maximal inhibitory concentration of the drug
for nep (5.2 x 107% mol/l) at all doses studied, as
shown in table 4 [11]; if the rise in circulating anf is a
consequence of inhibition of nep activity, the absence
of a dose-response relationship may reflect maximal
inhibition of the enzyme after administration of 10 mg
of the drug, and it is of interest that a similar lack of
relationship between drug dosage and plasma anf re-
sponse has been noted with other potent inhibitors of
nep in human and animal studies [18,19,22].

although it is possible that the rise in plasma anf
reflects mechanisms other than inhibition of peptide
degradation, evidence from animal studies using this
and other drugs which inhibit nep suggests that the
rise in circulating plasma levels reflects reduced clear-
ance of the peptide [10,23]. the rise in plasma anf
may reflect inhibition of anf breakdown in sites other
than the kidney since an increase in the half-life of ex-
ogenous anf is seen in nephrectomized animals given
+ xxxd420xxx  [24]. within the kidney, inhibition of
nep will prevent breakdown of filtered anf, and this
may be expected to increase urinary excretion of the
peptide without appreciably altering plasma levels.

a significant rise in urinary sodium excretion was
observed at the highest dose of  xxxd419xxx  studied
(200 mg); this may be a consequence of increased anf
availability to its renal ( xxxg1587xxx ) receptors.
nep degrades a number of other peptide substrates,
including kinins, and it is possible that other natri-
uretic mechanisms may account for the increase in uri-
nary sodium excretion after enzyme inhibition. how-
ever, animal studies using +  xxxd420xxx  have shown
that the natriuretic effect of the drug can be abolished
by co-administration of specific polyclonal anf anti-
serum, suggesting that the increase in urinary sodium
excretion is due to increased anf availability to renal
receptors [10]. furthermore, studies in animals with
other inhibitors of nep have shown no evidence of
potentiation of the actions of exogenous kinins but
clear enhancement of the actions of anf. this sug-
gests that the effect of this drug class are mediated via
anf [20,25].

the failure of lower doses (10 and 50mg) of can-
doxatril to cause an increase in urinary sodium ex-

275
276

cretion despite a distinct increase in plasma anf lev-
els contrasts with the study of richards et al [21],
who demonstrated a small but statistically significant
natriuresis at doses of 25 and 50 mg of the drug when
given to normal human subjects. the reason for this
discrepancy may be due to the small sample size and
the fact that subjects were not in external sodium bal-
ance — factors which may prevent the identification
of a small change in urinary electrolyte excretion. it
remains possible that, with strict control of external
sodium balance, a natriuresis would have been ob-
served at the lower doses. in fact, basal plasma anf
levels were lower on the active treatment days in both
the 10 and 50 mg groups (table 1). this may reflect re-
duced sodium intake prior to these study days, which
would result in a reduced apparent natriuretic effect of
the compound. overall, although it is clear from the
present study that 200 mg  xxxd419xxx  is natriuretic, a
larger study of patients in fixed sodium balance will be
required to establish the presence or absence of any
effect at lower doses.

the natriuresis observed after the highest dose of can-
doxatril was associated with a significant diuresis. the
protocol used in this study involved oral water replace-
ment of urine passed after an initial water load; this
would tend to amplify any diuretic effect of the drug,
and the failure of the two lower doses to alter urine
volume in this setting would be consistent with the ab-
sence of an effect upon urinary sodium excretion. the
amplification of diuresis does imply that the present
data cannot be used to assess the diuretic action of
 xxxd419xxx  under non-water loaded/replacement con-
ditions. no change in urinary potassium excretion was
seen at any dose of the drug studied. this lack of kali-
uretic effect is similar to the failure of low-dose anf
infusion to alter urinary potassium excretion despite a
clear natriuresis [5,22,26]. furthermore, no change in
urinary potassium excretion was seen in human sub-
jects given + xxxd420xxx  by iv. infusion, despite a
marked increase in urinary sodium excretion [11].

there was a trend towards suppression of plasma
active renin concentration following administration
of the highest dose of  xxxd419xxx  despite the na-
triuresis, and this tendency was also noted for
plasma aldosterone concentration. similar effects upon
the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone system have been
noted during low-dose anf infusion in human sub-
jects, probably reflecting a direct effect of anf upon
renin release [26~—29].

single-dose administration of  xxxd419xxx  in the present
study had no effect upon supine and standing heart
rate or blood pressure. it is of interest that single doses
of another nep inhibitor, sch34826, did not affect
blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat,
whereas repeated administration led to a fall in blood
pressure over 5 days [20]. in an uncontrolled study
of oral administration of the nep inhibitor sinorphan,
a fall in blood pressure in hypertensive humans has

been reported [30], although the significance of this
in the absence of adequate control data is uncertain.
it is clear from studies of anf infusion in man over
a range of doses that the natriuretic and hypotensive
effects of the peptide can be dissociated [5,7,26,31].
failure of blood pressure to fall following single-dose
administration of  xxxd419xxx , despite natriuresis, does
not imply that chronic administration of the drug will
not alter blood pressure in hypertensive subjects.

the therapeutic usefulness of anf in cardiovascular
disorders is limited by the need for iv. administration
of the peptide, and pharmacological manipulation of
endogenous anf offers an alternative means of uti-
lizing its action. studies in experimental animals with
+  xxxd420xxx  have confirmed that inhibition of anf
degradation results in increased plasma anf levels and
causes natriuresis and diuresis [10,11]. we have now
confirmed that an oral prodrug of the active enan-
tiomer of this compound is well absorbed in man, and
has similar effects upon both plasma anf and renal
function. this novel approach may have therapeutic
potential, and the results of larger studies of chronic
administration of such compounds are awaited with
interest.
