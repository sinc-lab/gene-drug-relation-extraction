a2-adrenoceptors have been pharmacologically
characterized into at least three subtypes, name a2~,
ot2b, and a2c. this classification scheme is based upon
radioligand and functional studies which have shown
that selective antagonists have a relatively higher affinity for one subtype than for the other subtypes (bylund,
1988). molecular cloning studies have also identified
similar az-adrenoceptor subtypes (harrison et al.,
1991). although pharmacological and molecular biology studies confirm the presence of multiple subtypes
of az-adrenoceptors, there has been little progress in
elucidating the physiological significance of these subtypes. in the present study we have examined the effect
of agonist pretreatment on az-adrenoceptor number in
ht29 cells, opossum kidney (ok) ceils, and chinese
hamster ovary cells (cho-k1) which have been stably
transfected with the az-adrenoceptor (cho- xxxg82xxx ).
the ht29 and c h o - a 2 a r cells have been pharmacologically characterized as expressing the aza subtype
whereas the ok cells express the a2c subtype of the
a2-adrenoceptor. the results of the present study suggest that the otza- and azc-adrenoceptor subtypes are
differentially down-regulated by agonist pretreatment.
we have previously shown that both ht29 and ok
cells undergo rapid functional desensitization following
agonist preincubation (jones et al., 1990). in the present studies, we investigated *.be effect of prolonged
preincubation with various concentrations of norepinephrine on the extent of down-regulation of receptor number. as shown in fig. 1, 24 h pretreatment of
ok and ht29 cells with norepinephrine induced a
dose dependent decrease in a2-ad:;enoeeptor number
with an apparent maximal receptor loss of 50% in both
cell lines. the concentrations of norepinephrine needed
to produce half maximal loss of receptor number were

0.07 # m and 2 / x m in the ok and ht29 cells, respectively. thus, norepinephrine was 30-fold more potent
at down-regulating the a2-adrenoceptor in ok cells as
compared to ht29 cells. by contrast, norepinephrine
produced approximately equal degrees of functional
desensitization in the two cell lines (jones et al., 1990).
furthermore, norepinephrine is equipotent in the two
cell lines in inhibiting cyclic a m p production (---0.8
~ m ) and in inhibiting radioligand binding ( ~ 0.2/,m).
the differential potency of norepinephrine in causing clown-regulation could be due either to an intrinsic
diffcrence in the receptor subtype (ht29, a2a; ok,
a2c) or to differences in the cells themselves. accordingly, we determined the potency of norepinephrine in
down-regulating the aza receptor stably transfected

fig. 1. norepinephrin,: c,~ncentration dependence of a2-adrenoceptor down-regulation in ok, ht29, and cho- xxxg82xxx  cells. cells were
preincubated ~izh various concentrations of norepinephrine for 24 h,
membranes were isolated, and saturation binding experiments with
[3h]rauwolscine were performed as described previously (jones et
al., 1990, 1991). the data are expressed as percent of control and
represent the mean _+sem. the receptor density (braa×) for control
treatment groups in the ok (n = 5), cho- xxxg82xxx  (n = 5), and ht29
cells (n = 3) was 108_+17, 2180_+450, arid 125___7fmol/mg protein,
respectively. the k d values for control treatment groups in the ok,
cho- xxxg82xxx , and ht29 cells were 0.10_+0.02, 0.78+0.26, and 0.70_+

into cho cells. the dose-re~:~,onsc cur~e for noreoinephrine in the cho-a2/'.i~, cell was identica! to

that in ht29 cells (see fig. 1), ir,dicating that the
differential down-regulation is most likely an intrinsic
characteristic of the two a2-adrenoceptor subtypes involved.
it may be possible to confirm this conclusion in
future studies whet. cho cells stably transfected with
the ez2c receptor become available. it is particularly
noteworthy that the characteristics of down-regulation
a~e similar in the ht29 and cho cell lines, since the
transfection of the cho cells included only the ~egion
coding for the receptor and not the promoter sequcnces (fraser et al., 1989). thus, down-regulation of
at ieast the aea receptor may be determined largely by
post-transcriptional events.
