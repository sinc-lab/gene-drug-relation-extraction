2007; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00441.2005.—the vasopressin type 2 receptor ( xxxg231xxx ) is a g protein-coupled receptor that plays a central role
in renal water reabsorption. termination of ligand (vasopressin)
stimulation is an important physiological regulatory event, but few
proteins that interact with the  xxxg231xxx  during downregulation after
vasopressin (vp) binding have been identified. using yeast twohybrid screening of a human kidney cdna library, we show that a
100-kda protein called alg-2-interacting protein x (alix) interacts
with the last 29 amino acids of the  xxxg231xxx  cooh terminus. this was
confirmed by pull-down assays using a gst- xxxg231xxx -cooh-tail fusion
protein. alix was immunolocalized in principal cells of the kidney,
which also express the  xxxg231xxx . the function of the alix- xxxg231xxx  interaction
was studied by transfecting alix into llc- xxxg1757xxx  epithelial cells expressing  xxxg231xxx -green fluorescent protein (gfp). under basal conditions,  xxxg231xxx -gfp localized mainly at the plasma membrane. on vp
treatment,  xxxg231xxx -gfp was internalized into perinuclear vesicles in the
nontransfected cells. in contrast,  xxxg231xxx -gfp fluorescence was virtually
undetectable 2 h after exposure to vp in cells that coexpressed alix.
western blotting using an anti-gfp antibody showed marked degradation of the  xxxg231xxx  after 2 h in the presence of vp and alix, a time
point at which little or no degradation was detected in the absence of
alix. in contrast, little or no degradation of the  xxxg1885xxx 
receptor was detectable in the presence or absence of alix and/or the
pth ligand. the vp-induced disappearance of  xxxg231xxx -gfp was abolished by chloroquine, a lysosomal degradation inhibitor, but not by
mg132, a proteosome inhibitor. these data suggest that alix increases the rate of lysosomal degradation of  xxxg231xxx  and may play an
important regulatory role in the vp response by modulating  xxxg231xxx 
downregulation.

hormonal action. the internalization of g protein-coupled
receptor (gpcr) ligand complexes is complex and involves
several interacting proteins at different points in the pathway.
binding of ligand triggers the phosphorylation of the receptor
and coordinates the involvement of protein kinase-anchoring
proteins, specific kinases, and in some cases small gtpbinding proteins (8, 24, 37). after phosphorylation has occurred, ␤-arrestin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the
receptors, which undergo internalization via clathrin-mediated
endocytosis (25). the budding vesicle is pinched off from the
membrane by a dynamin-dependent mechanism (51), and the
newly formed vesicle is rapidly uncoated and fuses with early
endosomes. some receptors reappear at the cell surface rapidly,
whereas others are sent for degradation in either the lysosomal
compartment or the proteosome pathway.
recent studies showed that the pathway taken by different
receptors after internalization is dictated by specific protein
interactions and specific sorting signals. the na⫹/h⫹ exchanger regulatory factor (nherf) that binds the pdz-site at
the cooh tail of the ␤-adrenergic receptor is important in
conferring “rapid” recovery of functional membrane-binding
sites after downregulation (12). both the ␣-adrenergic and
␤-adrenergic receptors also interact with the ␣-subunit of the
eukaryotic initiation factor 2b (22). arap1 is a protein that
interacts with the cooh tail of the type 1  xxxg99xxx 
receptor to promote the reappearance of this receptor at the cell
surface (14). in contrast, the ␣1b-adrenergic receptor is downregulated after interaction between its cooh-terminal cytoplasmic domain and the  xxxg278xxx , a multifunctional protein
(49). the cooh terminus of the  xxxg1632xxx  binds
the  xxxg1027xxx  (g protein)-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein (gasp) that promotes lysosomal trafficking (38, 47), whereas interaction of the dopamine receptor
cooh tail with the g-␣-interacting protein known as gipc
prevents lysosomal degradation of the receptor (18). recently,
proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (er) such as drip 78
have been shown to interact with receptors including the
dopamine  xxxg655xxx  and reduce surface ligand-binding sites.

dna constructs for two-hybrid screening and gst fusion proteins.
the last 29 amino acids from the cooh-terminal region of human
 xxxg231xxx  were cloned into gal4:dbd vector pas2–1 (clontech, palo
alto, ca) as a bait construct for yeast two-hybrid screening. the
coding sequence of the entire  xxxg231xxx  cooh-terminal cytoplasmic
domain construct (amino acids 342–370) was also subcloned into the
bacterial expression vector pet41a (novagen, madison, wi) as a
fusion protein with a gst tag on its nh2 terminus. the dna
constructs encoding the gst  xxxg231xxx  cooh-terminal fusion proteins
(gst- xxxg231xxx ) were sequenced to confirm their reading frame and
predicted composition. expression of gst- xxxg231xxx  in escherichia coli
(rosetta de3 strain) was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-␤-galactopyranoside (iptg; 0.2 mm) at 37°c for 4 –5 h. bacteria were lysed by
lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and 0.5% np-40 in ste buffer (150 mm nacl,
1 mm edta, 50 mm tris 䡠 hcl, ph 7.4). the bacterial supernatant
was allowed to bind to the glutathione-agarose column at 4°c for 40
min with gentle rocking. after being washed twice with washing
buffer 1 (ste buffer with nacl increased to 500 mm, 0.5% np-40,
and 0.1% triton x-100) and twice with ste buffer, the gst fusion
protein was allowed to either bind to the glutathione column or was
eluted with elution buffer (5 mm  xxxd2213xxx , 50 mm
tris 䡠 hcl, ph 8.0) following a standard protocol recommended by the
manufacturer. meanwhile, gst protein was also expressed and purified as described above. both purified gst and gst- xxxg231xxx  were
subsequently used for pull-down assays.
yeast two-hybrid screening and yeast two-hybrid assays. yeast
two-hybrid screening was performed in ah109 s. cerevisiae
(mata, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4d, gal80d,
lys2::gal1uas-gal1tata-his3, gal2uas-gal2tata- xxxg1661xxx ,
ura3: mel1uas-mel1tata-lacz, clontech) that contains three
reporters,  xxxg1661xxx , his3, and mel1, responding to gal4 strongly and
specifically. kc8 e. coli (hsdr, leub600, trpc9830, pyrf:tn5,
hisb463, lacdx74, stra, galu,k) was employed to segregate the
cdna library plasmid from the bait plasmid by nutritional selection.
xl1-blue e. coli (stratagene, la jolla, ca) was used for routine
plasmid propagation. yeast media were purchased from biogen.
ah109 s. cerevisiae can be propagated on nonselective solid agar
ypd plates or in liquid ypd medium. selective media are used for
selection of yeast transformants and/or the detection of bd-x/ad-y
interactions. in our system, the bd-expressing plasmid contains
trp1, while the ad-expressing plasmid contains leu2. the three
other prototrophic markers, his3,  xxxg1661xxx , and mel1, used in our
experiments serve as reporters. the medium-stringency selection
medium lacks tryptophan, leucine, and histidine; the high-stringency
selection medium lacks tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine,
but contains x-␣-gal (20 ␮g/ml). 3-aminotriazole (2.5 mm) was
added to all media to inhibit his3 leakiness. m9/-leu was used for

dimer with several receptors in the er and golgi apparatus, and
these complexes are maintained from translocation to the cell
surface until their subsequent lysosomal degradation (31, 36).
the vasopressin type 2 receptor ( xxxg231xxx ) that is involved in
stimulating water reabsorption in the collecting duct shows a
slow recycling pathway after stimulation with ligand (17). like
the ␤-adrenergic receptor, the  xxxg231xxx  also interacts with ␤-arrestin, and is internalized in a clathrin-coated pit-dependent manner (4, 32). however, the  xxxg231xxx  reappears at the cell surface
very slowly after vp stimulation, reaching prestimulation levels only after several hours. recently, we have shown that a
significant fraction of intracellular  xxxg231xxx  is targeted directly to
lysosomes for degradation after ligand-induced internalization
(3). this  xxxg231xxx  degradation pathway was also reported independently by robben et al. (35). this may partially explain the
“slow” recycling phenotype of the  xxxg231xxx . however, the mechanism(s) by which  xxxg231xxx  trafficking is regulated is not fully
understood, and, in particular, the proteins involved in directing the  xxxg231xxx  toward the lysosomal degradation compartment
are still elusive.
based on existing data from other receptors, some of which
are mentioned above, we hypothesized that the cooh-terminal domain of the  xxxg231xxx  plays an important role in receptor
targeting and fate determination. in this study, we screened for
proteins binding to the cooh terminus of the human  xxxg231xxx  by
the yeast two-hybrid method. five of the clones that were
isolated encode proteins that are portions of the same gene:
alg-2-interacting protein x (alix). alix is a 100-kda cytoplasmic protein containing two distinct domains, an nh2terminal domain (amino acids 1– 434) and a cooh-terminal
domain (amino acid 468 – 869) (30, 45). the cooh tail of
alix contains a proline-rich domain (prd) that has several
possible sh3-binding sites that interact with sh3p4, sh3p8,
and sh3p13, proteins collectively known as endophilins (33).
when the same alix cooh tail is coexpressed with endophilins, intracellular vacuoles/tubules are drastically enlarged and
can even form very large spherical vacuoles with a diameter of
up to several micrometers (7). it was also reported that an aip1
homolog in yeast, npi3/bro1, plays a significant role in the
downregulation, internalization, and degradation of a general
amino acid permease gap1 of saccharomyces cerevisiae in a
ubiquitin-dependent manner (40).
we show here that the  xxxg231xxx  cooh tail interacts with alix
in yeast two-hybrid and gst-fusion pull-down experiments.
overexpression of alix causes an increased rate of degradation
of the  xxxg231xxx  only after interaction of the receptor with ligand.
finally, localization of alix in principal cells in the kidney, the
site where  xxxg231xxx  normally resides and functions to regulate
vasopressin-mediated water transport, indicates that alix is
poised to affect  xxxg231xxx  degradation also in vivo. we propose that
alix-mediated degradation is a novel mechanism for regulating
the fate of the  xxxg231xxx , and perhaps other gpcrs after ligand
induced internalization.

control. cells were transfected when the cells were 60% confluent.
for transfection, 15 ␮l of lipofectamine were mixed with 4 ␮g of
plasmid dna incubated at room temperature for 30 min, before being
applied to the cells. cells were incubated with the transfection mixture
for 4 h at 37°c. transfected cells were harvested and solubilized for
20 min at 4°c in a cold ripa buffer (50 mm tris 䡠 hcl, ph 7.4, 150
mm nacl, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 1% np-40, 0.1% sds, and
protease inhibitor cocktail, roche). cell debris was spun down at
14,000 g, and the total protein concentration of the supernatant was
determined using the bca protein assay. proteins from the supernatant were used to study protein expression and degradation levels in
the presence of vp by western blotting and were also used for the
gst pull-down assay.
llc- xxxg231xxx -gfp cells were transfected as described above with
pcdna3 (as a control) or flag-alix. forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were stimulated with 1 ␮m vp for 1 or 2 h. cells
were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm hepes, ph 7.5,
0.5% np-40, 250 mm nacl, 2 mm edta, 10% glycerol and protease
inhibitor cocktail). cells were spun down at 14,000 g for 20 min at
4°c after 30-min shaking at 4°c. western blot analysis of the
supernatants was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-gfp antibody. hek cells were transiently transfected with  xxxg231xxx -gfp (6 ␮g) or
with gfp-tagged parathyroid  xxxg1603xxx  (pthr-gfp; 6 ␮g).
 xxxg231xxx -gfp and pthr-gfp were cotransfected with or without flagalix (10 ␮g). after 48 h, transfected cells were stimulated with either
1 ␮m vp or 1 ␮m pth (1–34) for 1– 4 h before sampling as
described above
renal papilla preparation. kidney membranes were prepared as
previously described (41). in brief, kidney papilla from six mice were
minced and homogenized in iced-cold hypotonic buffer (5 mm
tris 䡠 hcl, ph 7.4, 3 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta) containing protease
inhibitors (complete, boehringer-mannheim). after centrifugation,
the homogenate was centrifuged at 35,000 g for 20 min, and the pellet
was resuspended in ripa buffer containing protease inhibitors before
use in western blot analysis.
pull-down assay using gst- xxxg231xxx . purified gst- xxxg231xxx  and gst
alone were used for pull-down studies using hek293 cell lysates
expressing flag-alix. before the final pull-down assay, the cell
lysates were precleared on a glutathione column at 4°c for 40 min.
approximately 25 mg of the gst- xxxg231xxx  fusion protein were incubated
with the glutathione column, and 1 mg of precleared cell lysate was
applied at 4°c with gentle rocking for 2 h. the glutathione column
was washed four times with pbs containing 1 m nacl, triton x-100
(0.1%), and protease inhibitors to remove nonspecifically bound
proteins. purified gst protein was used as a control in side-by-side
experiments. the pulled down complexes were subjected to sdspage and immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody
against flag.
protein analysis with sds-page and western blotting. sdspage was conducted as described by the manufacturer (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca). reduced samples from cell lysates (10 ␮g) or kidney
membrane preparations (10 ␮g) were loaded onto each lane of a
standard nupage 4 –12% bis-tris gel and then electroblotted on
polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) filters (bio-rad, hercules, ca).
the filters were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in pbs-t buffer (pbs
buffer; 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 2.7
mm kcl, 137 mm nacl, ph 7.4, with 0.1% tween 20) by shaking for
2 h at room temperature (or overnight at 4°c) and were further
incubated with either a polyclonal anti-gfp (0.4 ␮g/ml) or anti-flag
antibody (3.5 ␮g/ml) in pbs-t buffer containing 1% nonfat milk,
respectively, for 1 h. after being washed three times in pbs-t, the
pvdf sheets were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody
coupled to peroxidase (0.16 ␮g/ml) in tbs-t buffer for 1 h. the
membranes were washed several times with pbs-t, and peroxidase
activity was detected with the ecl enhanced chemiluminescence
system (perkinelmer, boston, ma).

nutritional selection of kc8 e. coli transformants to rescue the
ad:cdna plasmid.
yeast two-hybrid screening was initiated with the construction of a
bd: xxxg231xxx  cytoplasmic domain construct as mentioned above. the
bd: xxxg231xxx  plasmid was first tested for his leakiness and autoactivation
of other reporters as recommended. the gal4 ad:human kidney
cdna library constructed in the yeast plasmid pact2 was purchased
from clontech. the ad:cdna plasmid library in pact2 was amplified according to the supplier’s instructions. a total amount of 5 mg
of library plasmid dna was purified from amplified e. coli colonies
using cscl banding.
the ah109 containing the pas2–1/alct plasmid was transformed with 0.2 mg of the ad:cdna plasmid library using a modified
lithium acetate method. the transformed cells were plated onto
medium-stringency selection medium and incubated at 30°c for 14
days. positive colonies were patched onto high-stringency selection
medium plates and incubated at 30°c until sufficient growth was
achieved and colonies turned blue. positive colonies were maintained
on high-stringency selection media until further characterized. colonies that activated all of the reporter genes in the ah109 stain were
further analyzed. the ad:cdna plasmid encoding the interacting
protein was isolated from yeast cells using the standard lycatase/
alkaline method and was transformed to kc8 e. coli by electroporation. the colonies containing the ad:cdna plasmid were rescued on
m9/-leu selection medium plates, and the plasmid dna was isolated
and sent for sequencing.
a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to further confirm the
positive interaction of pas2–1/alct and ad:cdna plasmids as
follows. ad:cdna plasmids isolated from the primary screen were
used to cotransform ah109 with pas2–1/alct to confirm activation
of reporters; the potential interacting clones were also cotransformed
to ah109 with bd vector alone to test for false positives via direct
interaction with gal4:dbd. transformed cells were plated on highstringency selection medium. ad:cdna clones that were positive
with pas2–1/alct but negative with pas2–1 were further characterized by dna sequencing. clones that failed to grow in the
reconfirmation screen or showed a strong interaction with gal4:
dbd were not pursued further.
antibody production and purification. a peptide (deikkereslendl)
corresponding to amino acids 561–574 of mouse alix was synthesized
by the peptide core facility at mgh. a previous study reported using
a similar sequence to raise a polyclonal antibody against alix (45). an
extra cysteine residue was added to the nh2 terminus for later
construction of an affinity column for antibody purification. part of the
synthesized peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin
(klh) for immunization. affinity purification of antibodies from
whole rabbit serum was carried out using a sulfolink kit from pierce
(rockford, il) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the
specificity of the polyclonal antibody was verified by western blotting.
cell culture. hek293 cells were cultured in dmem supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fbs, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). stable transfection of  xxxg231xxx -gfp into llc-pk1a
cells, a cell line that expresses a low amount of endogenous receptor
(3), was carried out by incubating cells (60% confluent) with a
mixture of lipofectamine (15 ␮l) and 4 ␮g of  xxxg231xxx -gfp plasmid
dna at 37°c for 4 h. after selection in medium, resistant individual
colonies were isolated, and their [3h]-vp-binding abilities were analyzed as described previously (4). several clones (llc- xxxg231xxx -gfp
cells) were isolated and characterized. llc- xxxg231xxx -gfp cells and our
existing llc-pk1a cells stably expressing flag- xxxg231xxx  (llc-flagv2r cells) (4) were routinely maintained and passaged in dmem
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fbs and 1 mg/ml of  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx ).
preparation of cell culture lysates. mammalian cell expression of
alix was carried out by transient transfection of hek293 cells with
flag-alix. the empty vector (pcdna3 vector) was used as a

thus no signal overlap was seen despite the use of two antibodies
raised in the same species. after final washes with pbs, sections were
mounted and examined as describe above.
immunofluorescence of llc- xxxg231xxx -gfp cells transfected with
flag-alix. llc- xxxg231xxx -gfp cells were plated on 12 ⫻ 12-mm glass
coverslips (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa). cells were transfected
with flag-alix in the pcdna3 vector as described above. transfected cells were incubated with or without vp (1 ␮m) at 37°c in
either the presence or absence of diverse agents as detailed below.
cells were pretreated 20 min with the proteasome inhibitor (mg132,
10 ␮m) or the lysosome degradation inhibitor (chloroquine, 0.1 ␮m).
those concentrations have been shown to inhibit  xxxg231xxx  degradation
efficiently (3, 35). both drugs were present during the incubation with
vp (1 ␮m) for 90 min. after treatment, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (electron microscopy sciences, washington,
pa)-5% sucrose in pbs for 20 min at room temperature. the cells
were washed three times in pbs and then used for immunocytochemistry. cells were permeabilized with 0.1% triton in pbs buffer for 3
min at room temperature before incubation with primary antibodies as
above for tissue sections. cells were incubated with monoclonal
anti-flag antibody (11 ␮g/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. cy3conjugated goat-anti-mouse igg (1.5 ␮g/ml) was applied for 1 h at
room temperature. coverslips were mounted on slides with vectashield medium (vector labs) and examined using a zeiss/bio-rad
radiance 2000 confocal microscope.
in addition to these antibodies, we also used a fluorescent marker
to study the intracellular localization of flag-alix. cells were
preincubated for 30 min with lysotracker (500 nm, molecular
probes), a marker of acidic compartments including lysosomes and
late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, before the vp treatment. vesicles containing alix were then compared with the distribution of
lysotracker-labeled vesicles. after incubation, the cells were fixed
and visualized as described aboved.

elkhart, in), frozen in the microtome chamber, and sectioned at 5 ␮m
with a reichert frigocut microtome (leica microsystems, deerfield,
il). sections were picked up on fisher superfrost plus slides (fisher
scientific, philadelphia, pa) for immunohistochemistry.
after rehydration in pbs buffer, the kidney tissue sections were
treated with 1% sds in pbs ph 7.4 for 3 min as an antigen retrieval
step (6). nonspecific binding interactions were reduced by incubating
the kidney tissues sections for 20 min in pbs-bsa 1% solution before
the addition of the primary antibody. then kidney sections were
incubated 1 h in the presence of immunopurified anti-alix antibody
(10 ng/ml final concentration) in the absence or presence of the
corresponding antigenic peptide (100 ng/ml) or in the presence of
preimmune serum (10 ng/ml). after being washed with pbs, tissues
were then incubated with a cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (2
␮g/ml) for 60 min at room temperature. after final washes with pbs,
sections were mounted in vectashield (vector labs, burlingame, ca)
and examined using a zeiss/bio-rad radiance 2000 laser confocal
microscope (carl zeiss microimaging, thornwood, ny).
to perform double labeling, the anti-alix antibody was first detected using a tyramide signal amplification procedure to avoid signal
cross-reactivity that would otherwise result from double labeling
using primary antibodies raised in the same species. this procedure
has been described previously in work from our laboratory (5). the
kidney tissue sections were rehydrated in pbs buffer, then treated
with 1% sds in pbs, ph 7.4, for 3 min, and washed three times
before incubation in the presence of 3%  xxxd2298xxx 
for 10 min. the tissues were blocked with a biotin-blocking reagent
(molecular probes) and then blocked again following the instructions
of the tsa amplification kit (perkinelmer lifesciences). kidney
sections were incubated with the affinity-purified rabbit primary
antibody against alix diluted to 0.5 ng/ml for 90 min. at this antibody
concentration, interaction between the alix antibody and the antirabbit igg-cy3 secondary antibody used in the second step (see
below) was not detectable. to visualize alix fluorescence, the antibody signal was amplified using the tsa-fitc fluorescence system,
following the instructions of the manufacturer. after washing with
pbs, tissues were then reincubated with either polyclonal anti-aqp2
antibody (diluted 1/50) or an anti-v-atpase antibody (diluted 1/20)
for 1 h. a cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (2 ␮g/ml) was applied
for 60 min at room temperature. the interaction of this reagent with
the anti-alix primary antibody was below the threshold of detection

role of alix in vasopressin receptor degradation

is an 869-amino acid cytoplasmic protein with two distinct
domains, the cooh domain from amino acids 1– 434 and the
nh2 domain from amino acids 468 – 869 (7). sequence analysis showed that all five clones encoded for the cooh domain
of alix, but all clones also contained at least a part of the nh2
domain (fig. 1). clone 1 starts at amino acid (aa) 206, clone 2
at aa 211, clone 3 at aa 305, clone 4 at aa 307, and clone 5 from
aa 382. this observation suggested that the cooh-terminal
domain of alix might be involved in mediating the interaction
between alix and  xxxg231xxx . thus we investigated further the
interactions in vitro by binding assays.
pull-down assays with gst fusion proteins. purified gstv2r and gst alone were used in pull-down assays using cell
lysates from hek293 cells transfected with flag-alix. the
pull-down complex was subjected to sds-page and western
blotting with antibody against flag peptide. flag-alix, a
protein of ⬃100 kda, was very strongly expressed in hek293
cells (fig. 2, lane 1), but this band was not detected in
pull-down assays using nontransfected cells (fig. 2, lane 2).
the gst- xxxg231xxx  cooh tail (fig. 2, lane 4) but not gst alone

(fig. 2, lane 3) was able to pull down flag-alix from
overexpressing cells. these data provide further evidence that
the  xxxg231xxx  cooh tail interacts with alix, although pull-down
assays do not necessarily imply that the interaction is direct.
characterization of the anti-alix antibody and immunolocalization of alix in kidney sections. characterization of the
anti-alix antibody is shown in fig. 3. the polyclonal antibody
detects a 100-kda band in hek293 cells transfected with alix
(fig. 3a, lane 4) but not in untransfected cells (fig. 3a, lane 3),
reflecting a low expression of endogenous alix in these cells.
a monoclonal anti-flag antibody shows a similar pattern in
fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 2. furthermore, the anti-alix antibody
detected a major band at ⬃100 kda in mouse kidney and a
lower minor band at ⬃60 kda (fig. 3b, lane 1) that is
displaced by peptide competition (fig. 3b, lane 2). those
bands are not observed using preimmune serum from the same
rabbit before immunization (fig. 3b, lane 3).
kidney tissue slices were immunostained with a polyclonal
antibody against human alix and with either an anti-aqp2
antibody that labeled principal cells or anti-v-atpase antibodies to identify intercalated cells. the anti-alix antibody
showed bright staining throughout the cytoplasm in kidney
tissue (fig. 4a). staining is abolished when kidney tissues are
incubated with antibody pretreated with the immunizing peptide or with preimmune serum (fig. 4, b and c, respectively).
the immunolocalization data show that alix is expressed in
kidney where it is associated with different types of cells.
figure 5, a–c, shows that alix is present on large intracellular
vesicles in aqp2-positive principal cells in the collecting duct.
figure 5, d–f, shows that alix is also expressed in v-atpasepositive collecting duct intercalated cells. thus while alix
expression is not specific for one cell type, the localization of
alix in principal cells that express aqp2 and the  xxxg231xxx  supports
the notion that alix might play a role in protein and receptor
trafficking in these cells.

stably expressing  xxxg231xxx -gfp (fig. 6a), and it was found to have
a cytoplasmic distribution (fig. 6a). overexpression of flagalix does not affect either the level of expression or the
localization of  xxxg231xxx -gfp (fig. 6b).  xxxg231xxx -gfp is localized
mainly in the plasma membrane, but some is also present in the
cytoplasm: the pattern of fluorescence is mostly distinct from

vector (a) or a kidney membrane preparation (b) using an antibody directed against 14 amino acids of mouse alix, raised in rabbit and affinity purified is shown.
a: anti-alix antibody (lanes 3 and 4) was compared with an anti-flag monoclonal antibody, a positive control (lanes 1 and 2). both antibodies detected a broad
band at ⬃100 kda in hek293 cell lysates transfected with flag-alix (lanes 2 and 4, respectively). no bands were observed in lysates of cells transfected with
an empty vector pcdna3. b: anti-alix antibody (lane 1) detected a major band at ⬃100 kda in kidney preparations as well as a weaker band at a lower molecular
mass. both bands were undetectable when anti-alix antibody was preincubated with the immunizing peptide (lane 2). furthermore, these bands were not
detectable using preimmune serum from the same rabbit that was used to raise the anti-alix antibody (lane 3).

fig. 2. gst pull-down assay using the gst- xxxg231xxx  cooh tail fusion protein
shows the ability of this portion of the  xxxg231xxx  to interact (directly or indirectly)
with alix. western blot analysis of the proteins pulled-down from flagalix-transfected hek293 cell lysates was performed using an anti-flag
antibody as a probe. a 100-kda band was detected in the flag-alixtransfected cell homogenate using anti-flag igg (lane 1). no band was
observed when the pull-down was performed with the the gst- xxxg231xxx  cooh

done with gst alone and flag- xxxg231xxx -transfected cells (lane 3). in contrast, a

membrane gfp- xxxg231xxx  fluorescence is lost, whereas intracellular
gfp fluorescence increases. the  xxxg231xxx -gfp appears to be
internalized into juxtanuclear vesicles (fig. 6, e and h) in most

contrast, under these conditions,  xxxg231xxx -gfp was not detectable
in the alix-transfected cells (fig. 7g), as also shown in fig. 6.
these results suggest that the rate of delivery of  xxxg231xxx -gfp to
lysosomes for degradation is increased in the presence of
flag-alix, which also becomes localized in lysotrackerpositive structures after vp treatment.
to characterize the role of flag-alix interactions, the
degradation of  xxxg231xxx -gfp was examined by western blot analysis using an anti-gfp antibody. transfection of flag-alix
did not affect the staining pattern of  xxxg231xxx -gfp in llc-pk1a
cells where the major band detected is a doublet at ⬃57– 68
kda (fig. 8, lane 1 vs. lane 4). in the presence of vp, a timeand vp-dependent increase in the intensity of a lower molecular weight band at ⬃46 kda was observed in cells transfected
with flag-alix (fig. 8, lane 3 vs. lane 6). the intensity of the

46-kda band increased sevenfold between the first and the
second hour of incubation in the presence of vp in cells
transfected with flag- xxxg231xxx  (fig. 8, lanes 1–3), whereas no
significant modification in intensity was observed in nontransfected cells (fig. 8, lanes 4 – 6).
we have recently shown that this band is a degradation
product and is not due to changes in glycosylation of  xxxg231xxx -gfp
(3). the smaller, higher molecular weight band that appears
after 2 h of vp treatment in cells not overexpressing alix (fig.
8, lane 6) may also represent a partial degradation product of
the  xxxg231xxx -gfp chimera. this result confirms our previous data
that vp causes degradation of  xxxg231xxx -gfp, but suggests that the
rate or the extent of degradation is increased by alix transfection, since the major 46-kda degradation product that we
reported previously (3) is barely detectable at the 2-h time

role of alix in vasopressin receptor degradation

discussion

ligand-induced endocytosis contributes to the physiological
regulation of a wide variety of signaling receptors, and the
endocytosis of gpcrs has, therefore, been a widely studied
phenomenon. it is now well established that an array of
proteins such as ␤-arrestin, dynamin, amphiphysin, synaptojanin and endophilin are closely related to the formation, fission,
and uncoating of clathrin-coated pits and have a strong tie to
gpcr downregulation, recycling, and resensitization (10, 23,
50). however, the proteins and signaling pathways that are
involved in human  xxxg231xxx  trafficking are still relatively unknown. in the present study, we used the  xxxg231xxx  cooh tail as
bait in the yeast two-hybrid assay. five positive clones were
isolated, which all coded for overlapping sequences from the
same protein, alix. this 100-kda cytosolic protein is also
known as aip1 and hp95 and is involved in apoptosis, cell
proliferation (30, 45, 48), and inducing vacuolization when
overexpressed in some cell types (7).
interaction of alix with the  xxxg231xxx  was confirmed using a
gst- xxxg231xxx  cooh-terminal fusion protein to pull down alix
from cell supernatants (30, 45). while such pull-down assays
can also reveal indirect protein interactions, our combined data

strongly suggest that alix binds directly to the  xxxg231xxx . immunofluorescence analysis confirmed data from other labs that alix
is present in the kidney (30, 45) and revealed that it is
expressed in cells of the collecting duct. the presence of alix
in vp-sensitive principal cells supports the hypothesis that alix
might be involved in  xxxg231xxx  regulation, but its localization in
adjacent intercalated cells that do not express the  xxxg231xxx  indicates that this interaction is not exclusive. indeed, alix has
several protein-protein interaction motifs that might allow
multiple distinct regulatory activities. for example, alix and its
yeast homolog (bro1) were found to interact with other
membrane proteins such as the egf receptor or gap1p,
respectively (15, 39, 44). based on the yeast two-hybrid data,
the cooh terminus of alix is able to bind to the last 29 amino
acids of hv2r, but the exact motifs that are involved in this
process are not yet known. the sequence of this coohterminal region is 70% conserved among v2rs from different
species, but it has no homology with any other members of the
vp/ xxxg1642xxx  family (2, 13). analysis of the hv2r
cooh tail shows a class iv ww domain interaction motif
(tp) that interacts with short proline-rich regions in other
proteins (19). however, the sequence is not conserved in all
species, and more work will be necessary to identify the amino
acid domains involved in the alix- xxxg231xxx  interaction.
while the presence of some alix at the plasma membrane
cannot be ruled out by our immunofluorescence studies, it is
also localized throughout the cytoplasm as previously observed
in other cell lines (45). using lysotracker as a marker that
accumulates in highly acidic organelles, the vesicles containing
alix are suggested to be lysosomes or late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (mvbs), cellular compartments in which several
other alix-interacting proteins including the  xxxg231xxx  have been
localized (3, 20, 21, 33, 42, 46). it is still unclear when and
where alix first interacts with the  xxxg231xxx . alix may play a role at
the plasma membrane by interacting with proteins involved in
endocytosis. one of these is endophilin, an enzyme that regulates membrane shape during endocytosis (26). endophilin is
an sh3 domain-containing protein and it functions as a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase that appears to be important

min with a proteasome inhibitor (mg132) or
a lysosomal degradation inhibitor (chloroquine). when cells were stimulated with 1
␮m vp for 90 min in the presence of
mg132,  xxxg231xxx -gfp (b, green) was internalized in the cytoplasm, and gfp fluorescence
was lost in cells overexpressing flag-alix
(a, arrow, red). after vp stimulation, v2rgfp was internalized in cells treated with
chloroquine but green fluorescence was still
detectable (e, green) even though flagalix (d, red) was similarly overexpressed.

ing stimulation with vp,  xxxg231xxx -gfp was degraded in the presence flag-alix as indicated by the loss of intracellular
fluorescence in alix-transfected cells (fig. 10, a–c). in contrast, when cells were pretreated with chloroquine,  xxxg231xxx -gfp
was internalized after vp stimulation, and no subsequent loss
of intracellular fluorescence was detectable even in cells overexpressing alix (fig. 10, d–f). interestingly, alix did not
appear to colocalize with the internalized  xxxg231xxx -gfp under
these conditions (fig. 10f). this suggests that chloroquine
treatment might have an effect on the cellular distribution of
alix that could also contribute to the inhibitory effect of
chloroquine on  xxxg231xxx  degradation that we have reported previously (3). this result supports the notion that the loss of
 xxxg231xxx -gfp fluorescence after 2-h vp treatment in alix-overexpressing cells is probably attributed to lysosomal degradation,
whereas the proteosome is not involved in this process.

for the invagination of clathrin-coated vesicles. its major binding partner is synaptojanin, which also binds to dynamin (28,
29). this observation suggests that alix may influence the fate
of the receptor when it interacts with  xxxg231xxx  at the membrane; the
complex is sent to lysosomes and/or late endosomes for degradation rather than being recycled (3, 35). another protein,
␤-arrestin, is also involved in the lysosomal trafficking of the
 xxxg231xxx  (17), and it is unknown how (or if) these two distinct
proteins act together to coordinate intracellular  xxxg231xxx  trafficking. it is also possible that alix, which is mainly localized in
mvbs in some cell types, interacts only with internalized  xxxg231xxx 
after ␤-arrestin binding has occurred. alix was located in
vesicles that originated from the mvbs that are intermediates
between early and late endosomes (43). bro1, the yeast homolog of alix, is a key protein that is involved in the formation
of luminal vesicles by inward budding of the limiting membrane of mvbs. the role of alix in the control of vesicle
budding in mvbs is also supported by several studies performed in eukaryotic cells (26, 33, 34, 42, 46). the  xxxg231xxx /alix
complex might, therefore, regulate  xxxg231xxx  delivery to a degradative compartment by facilitating passage through the mvb
and/or increasing the extent or efficiency of the production of
luminal vesicles inside mvbs. formation of these intraluminal
vesicles is under the control of a number of other proteins that
form the so-called escrt complex (1, 9), with which alix
interacts (42), and is critical for the subsequent lysosomal
degradation of membrane proteins, including the egf receptor
(11). furthermore, overexpression of alix affects also the
number and/or the shape mvbs without modifying other
intracellular compartments; such an increase in mvb “activity” might influence the rate of degradation of membrane
proteins (7, 27) and explain the increased rate of  xxxg231xxx  degradation found in the present study. in previous work, we were
able to detect a significant increase in protein bands representing  xxxg231xxx  degradation only 4 h after ligand addition to llc- xxxg1757xxx 
cells (3). after transfection of the same cells with alix, a lower
molecular weight degradation band was already detectable 1 h
after ligand stimulation and was greatly increased 2 h after
hormone addition. it should be pointed out that our ability to
detect the  xxxg231xxx  and any degradation products depends critically
on the retention of gfp antigenicity (by western blotting) or
fluorescence (by microscopy), since no useful antibodies
against the native  xxxg231xxx  are available at this time. therefore, it
is possible that other smaller or distinct degradation products
are present under the different conditions examined, but they
would be invisible to our fluorescence and western blotting
assays.
in summary, we show here that the 100-kda soluble protein
alix interacts in eukaryotic cells with the  xxxg231xxx , a member of
the gpcr family. transfection of renal epithelial cells with
alix increases the rate and/or the efficiency of  xxxg231xxx  trafficking
to lysosomes after ligand-induced internalization.
