introduction: the development of selective braf inhibitors in patients with
metastatic braf v600 mutant melanoma has proven to be an effective
therapeutic strategy. while  xxxd3501xxx  was the first approved braf
inhibitor for this indication, another selective braf inhibitor,  xxxd1795xxx ,
has demonstrated efficacy in patients with braf mutant melanoma, including
those with active brain metastases and other malignancies.
areas covered: this review covers the current role of braf inhibitors in
patients with metastatic melanoma and the clinical development of  xxxd1795xxx . the pharmacological, safety and efficacy data are discussed from the
phases i, ii and iii studies of  xxxd1795xxx . in addition, the results of the
phase ii study of  xxxd1795xxx  in melanoma patients with active brain metastases (break-mb) and the phase i/ii study of  xxxd1795xxx / xxxd3408xxx  are
examined.
expert opinion: while  xxxd1795xxx  has demonstrated comparable efficacy to
 xxxd3501xxx  in braf v600e mutant melanoma patients, the break-mb and
 xxxd1795xxx / xxxd3408xxx  studies have taken braf inhibitor strategies further
with evidence of disease activity in patients with metastatic melanoma brain
metastases and potential abrogation of braf inhibitor resistance.

introduction

the braf oncogene was first characterized in 2002, which causes activation of the
mitogen-activated kinase (mapk) pathway and subsequent cell growth, proliferation and metastasis [1]. these activating somatic mutations in exon 15 of the
braf gene are most commonly seen in melanoma (50%) and hairy cell leukemia
(98%) but are also present at lower incidences in other malignancies, such as colorectal cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and ovarian
cancer [1-3]. of these malignancies, the development of selective braf inhibitors
has been primarily focused on melanoma, the fifth and seventh most common
malignancy in men and women, respectively, in the united states [4]. in 2013, there
will be an estimated 76,690 cases of melanoma with 9,480 deaths from
metastatic disease.
historically, systemic therapies for metastatic melanoma were limited to chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents. while cytotoxic drugs, such as  xxxd1796xxx ,
temozolomide,  xxxd2160xxx , carboplatin and paclitaxel, have been utilized in this
setting, response rates have been modest (11 -- 15%) without a clear improvement
in overall survival [5-7]. there has been more enthusiasm for immunotherapies,
such as interleukin-2, which was approved by the united states federal drug
administration (fda) in 1998. while objective response rates with interleukin2 are low (6 -- 17%) and serious toxicities can occur, there are patients who achieve
durable remissions [8-10]. more recently, the anti-cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen

pivotal trials

overview of the market

the introduction of selective braf inhibitors has led to a
biomarker-driven, targeted approach in treating patients
with metastatic melanoma. the first successfully developed
compound to inhibit braf v600 mutant melanoma and
show clinical benefit was  xxxd3501xxx  ( xxxd3501xxx ) [13]. in
the phase iii study of  xxxd3501xxx , an overall objective
response rate of 48% was demonstrated, as compared to a
response rate of 5% for the comparator arm,  xxxd1796xxx  [14].
furthermore, median progression-free survival (mpfs) was
superior in patients treated with  xxxd3501xxx  as compared
to those who received  xxxd1796xxx  (5.3 vs 1.6 months
respectively; hazard ratio 0.26, p < 0.001). based on this
data,  xxxd3501xxx  was approved by the fda in august
2011, leading to its widespread use in patients with
metastatic melanoma.
several other selective braf inhibitors are currently under
clinical development (table 1). of these,  xxxd1795xxx  is the
next most extensively studied, including a completed
phase iii trial (box 1). discussion of this compound is the
subject of the following sections.
it is also important to note that braf inhibitors may have
clinical efficacy in malignancies other than melanoma, which
is an area of active investigation. in the phase i study of  xxxd1795xxx , partial responses were seen in patients with braf
v600 mutant papillary thyroid cancer, non-small-cell lung
cancer and colorectal cancer [15].  xxxd1795xxx  is actively being
evaluated in phase ii studies for patients with recurrent
thyroid cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer (table 1).

4 antibody, ipilimumab, was approved in the united states
and europe with objective response rates of 10 -- 11% and a
survival advantage over vaccine ( xxxg1784xxx ) or  xxxd1796xxx  [11,12].
as ipilimumab is an outpatient therapy associated with less
severe toxicities compared to interleukin-2, it is commonly
used as frontline therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.

introduction to the compound

 xxxd1795xxx  was first developed by glaxosmithkline (gsk)
under the name gsk2118436. it is an atp-competitive inhibitor of raf kinases, which most potently inhibits the braf
v600e mutant kinase (half-inhibitor concentration [ic50] of
0.8 nm) as compared to other raf kinases (ic50 of 3.2 and
5 nm for wild-type braf and craf kinases, respectively) [16].
similar, but less potent, selective  xxxg1924xxx  inhibition has
been reported for  xxxd3501xxx  (braf wild-type: 100 nm;
braf v600e: 31 nm and craf: 48 nm) [17]. the inhibitory
effect is most pronounced in cell lines that carry a braf
v600e mutation. in vivo experiments with xenograft mice
with subcutaneous implanted human melanoma or colorectal
tumors harboring the braf mutation demonstrated substantial growth inhibition with  xxxd1795xxx  treatment. this led to
the subsequent clinical trials of  xxxd1795xxx  in patients with
braf mutant melanoma and other malignancies.
4.

chemistry

as listed on pubchem (cid 44462760), the molecular formula for  xxxd1795xxx  is  xxxd1795xxx . it has molecular
weight of 519.6. the drug is dispensed as an oral capsule.
5.

pharmacodynamics

in vitro experiments with  xxxd1795xxx  in braf mutant melanoma cell lines have demonstrated pronounced inhibition of
downstream mediators of the mapk pathway within 24 h,
including mek and erk [18]. in addition, there is substantial
downregulation of  xxxg366xxx , which is involved in coordinating the function of cyclin-dependent kinases for the cell cycle
g1 to s phase transition.
pharmacodynamic studies were incorporated into the
phase i study of  xxxd1795xxx  (break1) [15]. eight paired
tumor biopsies from patients at baseline and 6 -- 13 days after
treatment with  xxxd1795xxx  showed a median decrease of 84%

early changes were seen by positron emission tomography
scan with a median decrease of 60% in the maximum standardized uptake value of tumor 18f-fludeoxyglucose (fdg)
uptake observed between baseline scans and those 2 weeks
after the start of therapy. it is important to note that both tissue and imaging studies were performed on patients enrolled
in the dose escalation phase and similar findings were
observed in the phase i study of  xxxd3501xxx  [13].
6.

pharmacokinetics and metabolism

proportional increases in  xxxd1795xxx  blood levels (exposure of
drug) were observed in oral doses up to 300 mg b.i.d. on the
first day of treatment [15]. however, continuous dosing of the
drug demonstrated less proportional increases in  xxxd1795xxx 
exposure levels. during the dose-escalation phase, a maximum tolerated dose was not reached (maximum dose of
300 mg b.i.d. was investigated). the recommended phase ii
dose of 150 mg b.i.d. was selected, as there was minimal
increase in drug exposure and no increase in the proportion
of responding patients with higher dose levels. at the  xxxd1795xxx  150 mg b.i.d. dose level, a maximum plasma concentration level at 2 h and a half-life of 5.2 h were observed. on
day 15, the mean area under the plasma concentration--time
curve over 12 h was 2619 ng*h/ml and the mean maximum
plasma concentration was 806 ng/ml.
7.

clinical efficacy

phase i evaluation (break-1)
the phase i study of  xxxd1795xxx  enrolled a total of 184
patients, including 156 patients with metastatic melanoma [15].
the presence of an activating braf v600 mutation was initially optional, but later required as no activity was seen in
the first three patients with braf wild-type malignancies.
dose levels were increased to 300 mg b.i.d. without reaching
a maximum tolerated dose. at the recommended phase ii
7.1

dose of 150 mg b.i.d. of  xxxd1795xxx , 25 of 36 patients (69%)
with braf v600 mutant melanoma experienced a partial or
complete response to therapy. the median duration of
response was 6.2 months and was similar between patients
with either v600e or v600k mutant melanoma, despite a
higher initial response rate for those with the braf v600e
mutation. an additional 10 patients with active, asymptomatic
melanoma brain metastases were treated with  xxxd1795xxx 
150 mg b.i.d. nine (90%) of the patients showed a decrease
in the brain lesions with four of them achieving complete
resolution. the mpfs was 4.2 months and one patient had
progression-free survival for 15 months.
of the 28 non-melanoma braf mutant malignancies
treated on the phase i study, there were 14 patients with papillary thyroid cancer, 11 patients with colorectal cancer, and
one patient each with non-small-cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) and ovarian cancer included in
the study. while less robust, there were partial responses
seen in three thyroid cancer patients and the non-small-cell
lung cancer patient. tumor regression that did not meet
recist criteria for a partial response was observed in both
the gist and ovarian cancer patients. of the braf v600e
mutant colorectal patients, only one patient had a confirmed
response with  xxxd1795xxx . this low response rate in colorectal
cancer may be attributable to resistance mechanisms involving
 xxxg1745xxx  mutations, pten-loss and increased kras and
egfr signaling [19].
also of interest is the enrollment of patients with melanoma harboring activating braf mutations other than
v600e or v600k. less common mutations are known to
occur within exon 15 of the braf gene, such as l597r,
v600d, v600r and k601e [20,21]. in the phase i study of
 xxxd1795xxx , three patients with melanomas harboring braf
 xxxd2565xxx  mutations demonstrated no response to therapy. however, clinical responses to braf inhibitors in patients with
braf l597r and v600r mutant melanoma have been
reported [22,23]. additionally, patients with melanoma harboring uncommon braf mutations may be sensitive to mek
inhibitors [24].

phase ii evaluation in melanoma (break-2)
in the oral abstract presented by trefzer et al. at the society
for melanoma research 2011 congress meeting, the data
was reported on the single arm, phase ii study of  xxxd1795xxx 
in braf v600e/k mutant melanoma patients [25]. a total
of 92 patients (76 braf v600e and 16 braf v600k)
were treated with  xxxd1795xxx  150 mg b.i.d. a response rate
of 60% (53% partial, 7% complete response) was observed
in the braf v600e mutant melanoma patients, whereas
only 13% of patients with braf v600k mutant melanoma
had a partial response to therapy (no complete responses).
similarly, the mpfs was also longer in the v600e group
than the v600k group (27 vs 20 weeks, respectively).
publication of the final data is awaited.

7.2

phase iii evaluation in melanoma (break-3)
the phase iii study of  xxxd1795xxx  included a total of
250 patients with braf v600e mutant metastatic melanoma
randomized to either  xxxd1795xxx  (150 mg b.i.d.) or  xxxd1796xxx  (1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) in a 3:1 ratio [6]. except
for interleukin-2, no prior treatment was allowed. crossover
from the  xxxd1796xxx  arm to  xxxd1795xxx  was permitted at disease progression. the primary endpoint was progressionfree survival with secondary endpoints of independent data
review, overall survival and objective response rate. the estimated mpfs was 5.1 months for the  xxxd1795xxx  group as
compared to 2.7 months for the  xxxd1796xxx  group. the hazard ratio was 0.30 (p < 0.0001). it should be noted that the
data was evaluated by an independent review committee,
which estimated slightly longer mpfs in both groups
(6.7 months  xxxd1795xxx  group, 2.9 months  xxxd1796xxx 
group) and a hazard ratio of 0.35.
with regard to the response rates (best confirmed), both
the investigator and independent review determined that
response rates were similar in the  xxxd1795xxx  group (53 and
50%, respectively). only 3% of patients achieved a complete
response. however, the waterfall plot demonstrated that a vast
majority of patients experienced some degree of tumor regression and responses were present in all disease stages from
unresectable stage iiic to m1c (ajcc 7th edition). the
 xxxd1796xxx  group had a substantially lower response rate
with some discrepancy between the investigator-assessed and
independent review determinations (objective response rate
of 19 vs 6%, respectively). as of december 2011, 44% of
patients on the  xxxd1796xxx  had crossed over to receive  xxxd1795xxx . while the data is not mature enough yet for the overall
survival calculations, the survival benefit calculation may be
obscured by the extent of crossover.
7.3

phase ii evaluation in melanoma brain
metastases (break-mb)

7.4

based on the promising results of the small cohort of melanoma patients with brain metastases on the break-1 study,
a phase ii study of patients with active braf v600e/k
896

mutant melanoma brain metastases was conducted with  xxxd1795xxx  150 mg b.i.d. [26]. a total of 172 patients were
enrolled between two cohorts: no prior brain metastasis treatment (cohort a; 89 patients) and prior brain metastasis treatment (cohort b; 83 patients). prior brain metastasis
treatments included surgery, whole brain radiation or stereotactic radiosurgery. most patients had one to four brain
metastases (91% cohort a; 83% cohort b) and had braf
v600e mutant melanoma (83% cohort a; 78% cohort b).
the overall intracranial response rate for braf v600e and
v600k mutant melanoma patients in cohort a was 29 and
6.7%, respectively. the median duration of intracranial
response was 4.7 and 2.9 months for these two populations.
overall disease responses (both intracranial and extracranial
disease) mirrored the intracranial response rates. the median
overall survival was 7.7 and 3.8 months for braf v600e
mutant melanoma patients and braf v600k mutant
melanoma patients, respectively.
patients who previously underwent treatment for melanoma
brain metastases (cohort b) had encouraging results as well.
the overall intracranial response rate was 20 and 22% for
braf v600e and v600k melanoma patients, and the median
duration of intracranial response was 6.6 and 3.9 months,
respectively. similar findings were seen in overall disease
response with median overall survival of 7.3 and 5.1 months
in braf v600e and v600k mutant melanoma patients.

phase i/ii evaluation of  xxxd1795xxx  plus
 xxxd3408xxx  in melanoma

7.5

as resistance to braf targeted therapy has been associated
with reactivation of the mapk pathway, a phase i/ii trial
was conducted with the combination of  xxxd1795xxx  plus the
 xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd3408xxx , in braf v600e/k mutant
metastatic melanoma patients [27]. a total of 247 patients
were enrolled. in the dose-escalation phase, 85 patients
received various doses of  xxxd1795xxx  (75 or 150 mg b.i.d.)
plus  xxxd3408xxx  (1, 1.5 or 2 mg/day). of note, the dose of  xxxd3408xxx  showing clinical benefit in the phase iii trial of braf
mutant metastatic melanoma patients was 2 mg/day [28]. the
phase ii component of the combination trial included
162 patients assigned to  xxxd1795xxx  (150 mg b.i.d.) plus  xxxd3408xxx  (1 or 2 mg/day) or  xxxd1795xxx  (150 mg b.i.d.) alone.
overall, the combination of  xxxd1795xxx  plus  xxxd3408xxx  was
well tolerated with infrequent dose-limiting toxicities. there
were signs of improved clinical benefit in patients receiving
the combination therapy. the overall response rate was 76%
in patients receiving the higher dose combination of  xxxd1795xxx / xxxd3408xxx  (150 mg b.i.d./2 mg/day) as compared to 50%
in patients receiving the lower dose combination of  xxxd1795xxx / xxxd3408xxx  (150 mg b.i.d./1 mg/day) and 54% in patients
receiving  xxxd1795xxx  monotherapy (150 mg b.i.d.). concordantly, mpfs was 9.4 months with the higher combination
therapy regimen as compared to 5.8 months with monotherapy (hazard ratio = 0.39). two randomized, phase iii trials of

expert opin. drug metab. toxicol. (2013) 9(7)

 xxxd1795xxx 

 xxxd1795xxx / xxxd3408xxx  combination therapy compared to braf
inhibitor monotherapy are ongoing to confirm these findings
(clinicaltrials.gov: nct01584648 and nct01597908).
safety and tolerability
overall,  xxxd1795xxx  has been well tolerated in patients with
metastatic melanoma, including those with active brain metastases. however, minor, tolerable side effects are relatively common. in the phase iii study of  xxxd1795xxx , 53% of patients
reported a grade 2 or higher adverse event [29]. the most
common adverse events were cutaneous (hyperkeratosis,
papillomas and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia), pyrexia,
fatigue, headache and arthralgias. grade 3 adverse events
were rare. dose reduction was needed in 28% of patients
and 3% discontinued the drug because of adverse events.
in the break-mb study of patients with active brain
metastases, the incidence of adverse events attributed to  xxxd1795xxx  was higher than the phase iii study quoted above [26].
about 82% of patients reported at least one grade 2 or higher
adverse event due to  xxxd1795xxx , with 22% of patients reporting a grade 3 or higher adverse event. pyrexia, hyperkeratosis,
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, rash, fatigue and headaches were the most common events. six grade 4 treatmentrelated adverse events were reported, including hematologic
events, convulsion and one intracranial hemorrhage. dose
interruptions and reductions were necessary in 37% of
patients in cohort a (no prior brain metastasis treatment)
and 55% of patients in cohort b (prior brain metastasis
treatment). only 2% of patients discontinued  xxxd1795xxx 
due to toxicities.
of special interest is the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (scc) and possibly other malignancies.
among the published studies with  xxxd1795xxx  monotherapy,
the incidence of treatment-related keratoacanthomas or
sccs was 6 to 19% [15,26,27,29]. this is comparable to the incidence rates of keratoacanthomas (8%) and sccs (12%)
reported in the phase iii study of  xxxd3501xxx  [14]. there
has also been concern about the possible development of other
secondary treatment-related malignancies with selective
braf v600 mutant kinase inhibitors due to paradoxical activation of the mapk pathway in braf wild-type cells [30].
the development of new primary melanomas, gastric and
colonic polyps, recurrence of colorectal cancer and acceleration of an occult ras-mutant leukemia have been described
in metastatic melanoma patients receiving braf inhibitor
therapy [31-34]. longer follow up of patients treated with
braf inhibitors will clarify the incidence of these secondary
malignancies and the impact on patient care.

regulatory affairs

 xxxd1795xxx  has completed phase iii evaluation and demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival
and overall response rates compared to  xxxd1796xxx  in braf
v600e mutant melanoma patients [6]. two randomized

phase iii trials comparing  xxxd1795xxx / xxxd3408xxx  combination
therapy with  xxxd1795xxx  (clinicaltrials.gov: nct01584648)
or  xxxd3501xxx  (clinicaltrials.gov: nct01597908) in
patients with braf v600 mutant melanoma are currently
underway. gsk has filed both a new drug application to the
us fda and a marketing authorization application to the
european medicines agency for ce mark approval of
 xxxd1795xxx  in braf v600 mutant melanoma patients.

conclusion

the development of braf-targeted therapies has been a
major breakthrough for metastatic melanoma patients and
the field of personalized medicine. the identification of the
braf v600 mutation as a therapeutic biomarker and the
clinical development of selective inhibitors have greatly
impacted patient care. while  xxxd3501xxx  was the first fda
approved therapy for braf v600e mutant melanoma, clinical studies of  xxxd1795xxx  in this patient population have
shown it to have similar efficacy. furthermore,  xxxd1795xxx 
has shown clinical activity in treating patients with melanoma
brain metastases and may be effective in other braf mutant
malignancies, such as thyroid cancer and non-small-cell lung
cancer. the combination of  xxxd1795xxx  with  xxxd3408xxx  to
overcome braf inhibitor resistance is a promising strategy
and results of the phase iii studies are eagerly awaited.
10.

expert opinion

there is no question that the clinical development of  xxxd3501xxx  has forever changed the treatment landscape for braf
mutant melanoma. other braf mutant malignancies may
also be sensitive to  xxxd3501xxx  and other selective braf inhibitors. this is an area of active investigation and may greatly
expand the use of this class of drugs. of the new braf inhibitors under clinical evaluation,  xxxd1795xxx  is the most studied
and has demonstrated response rates and progressionfree survival in phase iii evaluation of braf v600e mutant
melanoma patients similar to  xxxd3501xxx . there does appear
to be some subtle differences between the drugs with regard to
the raf protein selectivity and frequency of toxicities ( xxxd1795xxx  may have less photosensitivity, but possibly more pyrexia
than  xxxd3501xxx ). however, no head-to-head comparison
directly comparing  xxxd1795xxx  to  xxxd3501xxx  has been
performed to draw definitive conclusions.
where  xxxd1795xxx  does standout is in the various melanoma patient subgroups evaluated in clinical trials, as well as
the combination of  xxxd1795xxx  with  xxxd3408xxx . of these
additional subgroups,  xxxd1795xxx  has been prospectively
shown to have activity in melanoma patients with braf
v600k mutations and with active melanoma brain metastases
(break-2 and break-mb trials). furthermore, the combination of  xxxd1795xxx  plus  xxxd3408xxx  showed a better response
rate and progression-free survival than monotherapy with

 xxxd1795xxx  in phase i/ii study. while we are awaiting the
results of the randomized phase iii studies for confirmation,
combination therapy with braf and mek inhibitors may
become the next standard for braf v600e/k mutant melanoma patients. ongoing trials with  xxxd3501xxx  looking at these
melanoma patient subgroups, as well as in combination with the
mek inhibitor  xxxd1735xxx , may ultimately level the playing
field (clinicaltrials.gov: nct01586195, nct01378975 and
nct01271803). similarly, a combination trial of the selective
braf inhibitor  xxxd1992xxx  and the mek inhibitor  xxxd341xxx  is
ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov: nct01543698).

in addition to melanoma, it appears likely that the use of
braf inhibitors will expand to other braf mutant malignancies, such as hairy cell leukemia, thyroid cancer and nonsmall-cell lung cancer. this concept will further drive a more
genotype-driven therapeutic approach for personalized therapy
as compared to the traditional organ-specific classification
of disease.
