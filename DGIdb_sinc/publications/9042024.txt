asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with widespread but variable airflow
obstruction. the mechanisms that lead to airflow obstruction in asthma are bronchoconstriction,
mucosal edema, increased secretion of mucus, and an inflammatory-cell infiltrate that is rich in
leukotrienes (lts) b4, c4, d4, and e4 have been shown experimentally to play a role
eosinophils.
in each of these inflammatory mechanisms and to mimic the pathologic changes seen in asthma.
inhaled ltc4 and ltd4 are the most potent bronchoconstrictors yet studied in human subjects.
ltc4 and ltd4 also may cause migration of inflammatory cells into the asthmatic airway. lts are
derived from the  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx ) pathway of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism, and increased
production of lts has been demonstrated in patients who have asthma. leukotriene receptor
antagonists and specific inhibitors of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway hold great promise as new therapies to
treat asthma. because ltc4, ltd4, and lte4 appear to interact with a common  xxxg599xxx ,
selective  xxxg599xxx  antagonists (eg,  xxxd2995xxx  [sb205312/ xxxd2995xxx ],  xxxd3545xxx  [ici
204,219], mk-571, and mk-679), as well as  xxxd3554xxx  ( xxxd3554xxx , a direct inhibitor of  xxxg147xxx ) have
been developed as antiasthma agents. clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated the
efficacy of these compounds in reducing not only the symptoms of asthma, but use of p2-agonists
and bronchoconstriction induced by exposure to allergens, exercise, aspirin, and cold air.

tphe symptoms of asthma.dyspnea, wheezing,
-*coughing, and chest tightness.are caused by
airflow obstruction. another clinical feature of
asthma is increased airway responsiveness to various
stimuli.1 this means that smaller concentrations of
an inhaled bronchoconstrictor agonist are needed to
induce narrowing of the airway in subjects who have
asthma than are needed in normal subjects. also, the
maximal response to the bronchoconstrictor is
greater in subjects with asthma.
airway hyperresponsiveness, variable airflow ob¬
struction, and the symptoms of asthma are conse¬
quences of a characteristic form of cellular  xxxd2315xxx ¬
mation and structural changes in the airway wall of
patients with asthma.2 the inflammation consists of
the presence of activated eosinophils, lymphocytes,
and an increased number of mast cells, which have
been identified in both bal fluid and airway-tissue
samples from subjects who have asthma.3-6 the

structural changes described in the asthmatic airway,
which appear to be characteristic of the disease, are
likely caused by persistent inflammation of the air¬
way.78 these structural changes include patchy desquamation of the airway s epithelium, thickening of
the reticular collagen layer of the basement mem¬
brane,9 and hypertrophy of the airway's smooth
muscle.7
the mechanisms that lead to airflow obstruction in
asthma are bronchoconstriction caused by contrac¬
tion of the airway's smooth muscle, mucosal edema
caused by vascular leakage, increased secretion of
mucus, and an inflammatory-cell infiltrate that is rich
in eosinophils. leukotrienes (lts) have been shown
to play a role in each of these mech¬
experimentally
anisms. a role in asthma for the cysteinyl lts, known
to consist of ltc4, ltd4, and lte4,10 stems from

other inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and
monocytes, in the airways.37 however, the late-phase
asthmatic response also results from release of lts

inflammation are eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils,16 each of these cells releases a distinct
profile of lts. the principal product of human
and lung mast cells is ltc4,39'4849 and
eosinophils
is
the
ltb4
major product of alveolar macrophages
and neutrophils.5052 these cells also have the poten¬
tial to amplify the inflammatory response by releas¬
ing  xxxg147xxx  products. in inflammatory sites, cells such
as platelets, endothelial cells, and erythrocytes,
which do not normally release  xxxg147xxx  but do contain
 xxxg1347xxx , can metabolize exogenous  xxxg1346xxx  to
ltc4 and ltb4.53-55
the production of lts appears to be increased in
patients who have asthma. a threefold to fivefold
increase in production of ltb4 and ltc4 has been
shown ex vivo in leukocytes from patients who have
asthma, compared with those from healthy volun¬
teers.56 increased levels of ltc4 and ltd4 have
also been found in bal fluid after endobronchialallergen challenge in volunteers with asthma1719 and
in nasal secretions during reaction to aspirin in
aspirin-sensitive patients with asthma.57 further, uri¬
nary excretion of lte4 has been shown to be
increased in patients with asthma who were under¬

urinary lte4 could be demonstrated during the

allergen-induced late asthmatic response, even
though the magnitude of the bronchoconstriction
was similar to that during the early response.58
increases in urinary lte4 have also been demon¬
strated during acute spontaneous asthma.59 these
increases decline as the asthma is treated and the
bronchoconstriction resolves, a finding that suggests
that the lts are involved in the development of
asthma.

and

airway responsiveness

to my knowledge, the first report of the effects of
inhaled ltc4 and ltd4 in vivo was published in
1981 by holroyde et al,64 who demonstrated that
these mediators caused bronchoconstriction in nor¬
mal human subjects. subsequently, inhaled ltc4
and ltd4 were shown to be potent bronchoconstrictors in both normal subjects and patients with asth¬
ma.65 ltd4 has been shown to be at least 1,000
times more potent than histamine in causing smooth
muscle contraction (fig 3)14 and to have a longer
duration of action than inhaled histamine.65'67 in¬
haled ltc4 and ltd4 appear to have similar poten¬
cies, but lte4 is 30- to 100-fold less potent.68 the
onset of action for ltd4 and lte4 is 4 to 6 min, but
the effect of ltc4 is delayed 10 to 20 min.69
in general, the severity of airway hyperresponsive¬
ness is related to the severity of the asthma70 and to
the amount of medication needed for optimal control
of the symptoms of asthma.71 the response to
inhaled lts is exaggerated in persons who have
asthma compared with that in healthy volunteers.
airway hyperresponsiveness in subjects who have
asthma is nonspecific, so that an asthmatic who is

t-cell-derived proinflamma¬
tory cytokines may regulate the release of lts in the

chemotaxis is an important step in the migration

suggest that the lts are partially responsible for

function was much less than that achieved with large
doses of an inhaled (32-agonist. however, in both

and the p2-agonist was significantly greater than that

the best evidence that the lts play a central role
causing clinical models of asthma such as exer¬
cise-, cold air-, and allergen-induced bronchocon¬
striction is provided by the observations that many
different cyslt4-receptor antagonists (eg, pran¬
lukast;  xxxd3545xxx ; mk-571; mk-679) and lt-synthesis inhibitors (eg,  xxxd3554xxx ) markedly attenuate
bronchoconstrictor responses after exposure to exer¬
cise, cold air, and allergens.
in studies of exercise-induced asthma, mk-571
inhibited exercise-induced bronchoconstriction by
50 to 70%.24 also, the  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3554xxx  has
been shown to attenuate cold-air-induced broncho¬
constriction.32 in allergen-challenge studies, the ear¬
ly-phase and late-phase bronchoconstrictor re¬
sponses are reduced by  xxxd3545xxx .21 in a more
recent study, the cyslt4-receptor antagonist pran¬
lukast was shown to reduce significantly the changes
in total respiratory resistance and fevx in the later
part (20 to 60 min after challenge) of immediate

conclusion
in recent years, numerous studies have demon¬
strated the critical role that lts play in the patho¬
genesis of asthma and have confirmed the role
by ltc4 and ltd4 in causing bronchocon¬
played
striction in asthma. these studies have demonstrated
that inhaled ltc4 and ltd4 are the most potent
bronchoconstrictors yet studied in human subjects.
further, clinical models have supported the hypoth¬
esis that the lts play an important role in different
manifestations of asthma, such as exercise-, aller¬
gen-, and aspirin-induced asthma. moreover, spe¬
cific inhibitors of the  xxxg147xxx  pathway and the cyslt4receptor antagonists do seem to be effective in a
number of experimental models of asthma and, in
particular, in a number of clinical trials.
