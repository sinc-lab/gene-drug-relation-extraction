[mechanism of action of  xxxd3562xxx ].   xxxd3562xxx  is a new serotonergic agonist with excellent oral bioavailability exhibiting a potent symptomatic  xxxd2022xxx  effect.  xxxd3562xxx  is a selective agonist of 5-ht1b/d receptors. 5-ht1b receptors are concentrated in the wall of the cranial extracerebral arteries.  xxxg1110xxx  receptors are located on the trigeminal terminals which receive pain from the leptomeningeal vessels. migraine pain has its origin on cranial vessels. in fact, during a migraine attack the trigeminovascular system, which is composed by the cranial vessels and its trigeminal terminals, is activated. the activation of this system induces both dilatation and aseptic inflammation of cranial vessels.  xxxd3562xxx  blocks both vascular phenomena. its agonist action upon the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor ends the aseptic inflammation by inhibiting the release of vasoactive peptides. the dilatation of meningeal vessels disappears due to the stimulation of  xxxd3562xxx  of 5-ht1b receptors. as this drug crosses the blood brain barrier,  xxxd3562xxx  has both peripheral and central actions over the espinal trigeminal nucleus, which is rich in 5-ht1b/d receptors. thus, the mechanism of action of  xxxd3562xxx  is double. on the one hand,  xxxd3562xxx  acts peripherally inhibiting dilatation and inflammation of cranial vessels. on the other,  xxxd3562xxx  exhibits a central nociceptive action in the brainstem nuclei. this  xxxd2082xxx  of  xxxd3562xxx  on migraine pain is completed with its beneficial effects on nausea and vomiting, due to its binding to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, the center for control of vomiting.
