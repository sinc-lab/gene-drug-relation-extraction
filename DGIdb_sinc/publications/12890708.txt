vascular natriuretic peptide receptor-linked particulate guanylate cyclases are modulated by  xxxd2738xxx - xxxd1274xxx  signalling.  (1) the sensitivity of the particulate  xxxg1587xxx -cyclic  xxxd1274xxx  (cgmp) system to atrial (anp) and c-type (cnp) natriuretic peptides was investigated in aortae and mesenteric small arteries from wild-type (wt) and endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (enos) knockout (ko) mice. (2) anp and cnp produced concentration-dependent relaxations of mouse aorta that were significantly attenuated by the natriuretic peptide receptor (npr)-a/b antagonist hs-142-1 (10(-5) m). both anp and cnp were more potent in aortae from enos ko mice compared to wt. (3) the potency of anp and cnp in aortae from wt animals was increased in the presence of the nos inhibitor, n(g)-nitro-l-arginine (3 x 10(-4) m) and the soluble  xxxg1587xxx  inhibitor 1h-[1,2,4]oxadiazolol[4,3,a]quinoxalin-1-one (5 x 10(-6) m). (4) in contrast, the potency of anp and cnp in aortae from enos ko animals was reduced following pretreatment of tissues with supramaximal concentrations of the no-donor,  xxxd2741xxx  (3 x 10(-5) m, 30 min) or anp (10(-7) m, 30 min). (5) responses to acetylcholine in aortae from wt mice (dependent on the release of endothelium-derived no) were significantly reduced following pretreatment of tissues with gtn (3 x 10(-5) m, 30 min) and anp (10(-7) m, 30 min). (6) cnp and the no-donor,  xxxd3234xxx -nonoate caused concentration-dependent relaxations of mesenteric small arteries from wt animals that were significantly increased in enos ko mice compared to wt. anp was unable to significantly relax mesenteric arteries from wt or enos ko animals. (7) in conclusion, both  xxxg1587xxx - and  xxxg1588xxx -linked pgc pathways are modulated by no-cgmp in murine aorta and mesenteric small arteries and crossdesensitisation occurs between npr subtypes. the biological activity of endothelium-derived no is also influenced by the ambient concentration of no and natriuretic peptides. such an autoregulatory pathway may represent an important physiological homeostatic mechanism and link the paracrine activity of no and cnp with the endocrine functions of anp and bnp in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure.
