abstract

the effect of long-chain mono-ammonium compounds (long-chain macs), t-butyldccylammonium (iem-1078),
2,2,6,6-tetramethyldecylpiperidine (iem-1559), and diisopropyldecylammonium (iem-1194), on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) was studied in sympathetic ganglion neurons using the patch clamp method. long-chain
macs (1-10 /xm) strongly inhibited acetylcholine (ach)-induced current (ach-currcnt); thc block persisted for
hours after washing the drugs out. short-chain macs had a much weaker and completely rcvcrsiblc blocking effect.
suppression of ach-current by macs was dose- and voltage-dependent; it was absent at low ach doses or at
potentials >_ 60 mv and increased with higher ach doses or hyperpolarization. the second of two ach-currcnts
induced by paired application of ach was inhibited by long-chain macs more strongly than the first. this
use-dependent block also persisted for hours after washing the drugs out. additional inhibition of the sccond
ach-currcnt was reduced by lengthening the time interval between ach applications in the pair. time constants of
the recovery of the second ach-current in the presence and after washing out of long-chain macs were similar,
ranging from 45 to 140 s at - 5 0 mv for different long-chain macs, and decreased with de- or hyperpolarization.
the use-dependent block produced by long-chain macs could be prevented by another long-chain mac with a
small ammonium head (iem-i195, 75-100 # m ) or  xxxd3439xxx  (30 #m), a competitive antagonist of ach in
ganglia. neither the short-chain mac (iem-1405, 100 ~ m) nor ach (100 ~m) could exert this protective effect.
long-chain macs did not exert any use-, dose- or voltage-dependent supprcssion of ach-currcnt when applied
intracellularly. single-channel conductance was not affected by 1em-1194 (3-10 #m). we suggest that inhibition of

ach-current by long-chain macs is accounted for by (i) a long-lasting, apparently irreversible, binding of the drug
near the channel of nachr via its long aliphatic chain and (ii) a slow reversible block of the nachr channel with
the mac's ammonium head.

1. introduction

some ammonium ganglion-blocking agents, e.g.
hexamethonium (c6), were found to exert their
effect predominantly through the block of open
ionic channels of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nachrs) [1,2,9,11,16,19,20,23,24], while others,
e.g.  xxxd3439xxx  or  xxxd2550xxx , seem to
block the acetylcholine (ach) binding site on the
nachr [1] (but see [12]).
a new group of ganglionic blockers, long-chain
mono-ammonium compounds (long-chain macs),
of a common structure cmhz,n+i--n+rir2r3
(where m varies from 10 to 16, and ri, r 2 and
r~ are different groups or hydrogens) has been
synthesized [7]. the most potent of them (with
rn = 10) were found to be 2-9 and 5-100 times
more effective than c 6 in blocking synaptic transmission in cat superior cervical and ciliary ganglia, respectively. furthermore, these macs inhibited gastric secretion, vagus-induced decrease
in heart rate, and transmission in sympathetic
and parasympathetic ganglia for a much longer
time than c~ [25].
the present study was aimed at clarifying the
mechanisms underlying the blocking action of
long-chain macs.
some of the results presented here have been
published in brief earlier [8].

2. materials and methods

experiments were performed on the neurons
of isolated rat superior cervical ganglion. albino
rats (19-21 days old) were obtained from a vivarium and then killed under ether anesthesia. the
ganglia were excised and placed in normal saline
solution containing (mm):  xxxg2020xxx , 133; kc1, 5.9;
caci 2, 2.5; mgci z, 1.2; tris(oxymethyl)-amino-

methane, 10; d-glucose, 11 (ph 7.4). the connective tissues surrounding the ganglion were removed with fine forceps. the ganglion was then
treated with collagenase (0.4%, sigma, type ia)
for 30-40 min at 36°c. the treatment left the
ganglion partially dissociated, the outer ceils having clean membrane surfaces ready for patch
clamping.
ach-induced currents (ach-currents) ~'ere
recorded from the neurons 0.5 to 3 - 4 h after
enzyme treatment using the whole-cell patchclamp technique [10]. patch pipettes were filled
with artificial intracellular solution containing
(mm):  xxxg2020xxx , 140; cac12, 1; egta, 11; hepes,
10 (ph 7.2). potassium ions normally used in the
solution were replaced here with sodium ions in
order to prevent potassium currents which underlie muscarinic responses to ach. thus, ach-currents produced exclusively by nachr activation
could be recorded using no muscarinic antagonists over a wide range of membrane potentials.
the blockers tested were added to the perfusing
solution. ach was applied to the neuron
ionophoretically from a distance of 10-30 p.m
using 50-100 m.q electrodes filled with 1-1.5 m
ach. all experiments were carried out at room
temperature (20-25°c). the experimental methods have been described in more detail elsewhere
[6,21].
the drugs used were: acetylcholine chloride
(minmedbioprom, ussr), hexamethonium chloride (sigma), and t r i m e t h a p h a n camsylate
(roche). mono-ammonium compounds were synthesized in the institute of experimental medicine, russia (see table 1).
as all long-chain macs studied exerted qualitatively similar effects, we usually present here in
detail results obtained with one of the long-chain
macs giving statistics for all the drugs.
statistical data are expressed as mean + sem.

3.1. 'irrec'ersible' blocking action of long-chain

long-chain macs markedly depressed achcurrents and were more potent than c 6, a conventional ganglion-blocking agent. c 6 (50 /xm)
caused 74_+ 6% (n = 5) inhibition of a steadystate ach-current (in response to a long, 0.5-5 s,
ach application), whereas iem-1078 ( 2 - 3 /xm)
and iem-1194 ( 3 - 1 0 # m ) caused 78 _+ 4% (n = 6)
and 83 _+ 9% (n = 3) inhibition, respectively. unlike the reversible effect of c 6, inhibition of
ach-current produced by long-chain macs persisted after they had been washed out (fig. 1b).
there was only a slow and partial recovery of a

of washing out of all long-chain macs tested (7
out of 7 neurons, 7/7), with no further recovery
appearing during long (up to 4.5 h in one of the
neurons with the use of iem-1559) subsequent
washing. overall, 'irreversible' (henceforth this
term is used instead of 'long-lasting' to emphasize
the extra-long duration of the action) blocking
effects of long-chain macs on both steady-state
and transient (in response to a short, 30-300 ms,
ach application) ach-current were seen in all 52
neurons studied.
it was shown earlier that the effectiveness of
long-chain macs as ganglion-blocking agents increased with the lengthening of their aliphatic
chain from butyl to decyl [7]. thus, one can

234

d.e. kurenny et al. /journal of the autonomic nen'ous system 48 (1994) 231 240

assume that the potent irreversible action of
long-chain macs on ach-current derives from a
hydrophobic interaction of the long aliphatic
chain with nachr. in order to verify this suggestion two structural analogues of iem-1194 were
tested: iem-1405 containing the same ammonium head connected to the short ethyl group,
and iem-1195 containing the long decyl chain
and the much smaller a m m o n i u m head (see table
1). lem-i195 a p p e a r e d to block ach-current irreversibly although at higher concentrations than
iem-1194, while the action of 1em-1405 was
fully reversible, resembling that of c~ (fig. 1c, d).
it should be noted that the blocking activity of
either iem-1405 or iem-1195 was much lower
than that of iem-1194 (see fig. 1). similar results
were obtained when comparing the blocking action of iem-1559 and its analogue devoid of a
long aliphatic chain, iem-1288 (data not shown).
the above results confirm the earlier suggestion that it is the long aliphatic chain that is
responsible for irreversible blocking of n a c h r s
by long-chain macs. at the same time, the potency of a long-chain mac seems to be directly
related to the size of its ammonium head (see
also section 3.4).

3.2. dependence on ach dose of long-chain mac
blocking action
to clarify whether a blocker exerts its effect
competitively or noncompetitively, the dependence of the blocking action on agonist dose must
be studied. it is known that an increase in agonist
concentration results in the decrease or increase
in inhibition of steady-state ach-current produced by competitive or noncompetitive blockers,
respectively (e.g. [1]).
the action of iem-1194 on steady-state achcurrent at various ionophoretic currents was studied. the p a r a m e t e r a-l, where a was calculated
as the ratio of control ach-current amplitude to
the blocked one (see [1]), was used to quantify the
blocking effect of the drug. the value of a-1
substantially increased with an increase in
ionophoretic current (i.e. ach dose) and decreased with a decrease in ach dose, with no
blocking effect being observed at low ach doses

(fig. 2). such a dose-dependent block was seen in
all four neurons studied using iem-1194.
this result indicates that long-chain macs are
noncompetitive blockers of nachrs. the most
common type of noncompetitive inhibitory effect
is an open-channel block, which is supposed to be
voltage- and use-dependent. further experiments
were done to study their blocking mechanisms in
more detail.

3.3. voltage dependence of mac blocking action
fig. 3 shows the voltage dependence of the
steady-state ach-current in control and in the
presence of iem-1078 (2 #m). it can be seen
that inhibition of ach-current, a-i, increases
markedly with m e m b r a n e hyperpolarization and
decreases with m e m b r a n e depolarization, being
abolished at m e m b r a n e potentials >_ 6(j inv. a

decayed in the presence of iem-1288 but not in

faster kinetics of a blocking reaction for iem1288.

two other long-chain macs ( 1 - 1 0 g m ) were
tested. furthermore, voltage-dependent inhibition of ach-current was observed after the ganglion had been treated with iem-1078 (2 ~ m )
and then the blocker was washed out ( 3 / 3 ) .

3.4. use-dependent blocking action of macs
the ability of long-chain macs to produce
use-dependent blocking action was tested using
paired short (30-300 ms) ach applications. it
was found that in the presence of long-chain
macs (3-10 # m ) the second ach-current in the
pair was inhibited more strongly than the first.
again, the use-dependent inhibition of ach-current persisted after the drugs had been washed
out for 0.5-6 h (n = 27 for all long-chain macs).
the amplitude of the second ach-current recovered gradually toward the level of the first one
with an increase in time interval (at) between
the two ach applications from 0.5 s to several
minutes. the kinetics of this restoration were
similar both in the presence of a long-chain m a c
and after it had been washed out (see table 2).
relative inhibition of the second ach-current,
calculated as (11 - 1 2 ) / i l (where 11 and 12 were
peak amplitudes of the first and second ach-currents, respectively), exhibited a single-exponential
relation with at. fig. 5 gives an example of use-

dependent action of one of long-chain macs,
iem-1194 (5 izm).
the mean value of the time constant of the
exponential function ( r ) for the recovery of the
second ach-current had a maximum at a membrane potential of - 5 0 mv and decreased with
either depolarization or hyperpolarization. fig.
6a shows the mean value of r plotted against
m e m b r a n e potential in the presence of iem-1194
and after it was washed out. the corresponding
values of r at all potentials tested were not
significantly different from each other (student's
t-test: p > 0.05 at - 20 mv and p > 0.25 at other
potentials). similar results were obtained for two
other long-chain macs: p > 0.3 at - 50 mv and
p > 0.8 at - 2 0 mv for iem-1078, and p > 0.7 at
- 5 0 mv for iem-1559.
the r for iem-1288 was also voltage-dependent, although it was an order of magnitude less
than that for long-chain macs (fig. 6b). table 2
shows mean values of r at - 5 0 mv for all macs
displaying use-dependent effects. neither iem1405 ( 3 / 3 ) nor iem-i195 ( 7 / 7 ) acted in a usedependent manner, i.e. both ach-currents in a
pair had the same amplitude, at least for at >_0.5
s, which might be due to a value of r (<< 0.5 s)
too small to be resolved under the experimental
conditions used (data not shown).
all data described above, showing dose-, voltage- and use-dependent blocking action of macs,
indicate a possible open-channel blocking effect
(see discussion). the values of r for iem-1194
and iem-1078 (at - 2 0 and - 5 0 mv) and iem1559 (at - 5 0 mv) as well as for iem-1288 (at
- 5 0 mv) did not depend on blocker concentration (3-10 # m ; p > 0.25; see. for instance, fig.
6c). therefore, the reciprocal values of r should
correspond to the rate constants of dissociation
(k b) of the blockers from the open n a c h r
channel. mean values of k f~ calculated for wlrious macs are listed in table 2.

solution, both use- ( 2 / 2 ) and voltage-dependent
( 3 / 3 ) inhibition of ach-current appeared only
following addition of either drug ( 0 . 5 - 1 0 / x m ) to
the bathing media.
alternatively, the irreversible inhibition of
ach-current by long-chain macs could be accounted for by their tight hydrophobic binding to
nachrs. in order to test this possibility we tried
to prevent the irreversible binding of long-chain
macs to the receptors using various protectors.
the ganglion was perfused in sequence with solutions containing: (i) a protector alone, (ii) a protector together with a long-chain mac, and (iii) a
protector alone again. then the ganglion was
washed and the response to paired ach application recorded. the presence or the absence of
the use-dependent block was used as a criterion
of unsuccessful or successful protection against
the irreversible binding of a long-chain mac,

it should be noted that both voltage- and use-dependent blocking effects were observed in all
neurons tested (n = 17) even when the ganglion
had been treated with a long-chain mac and no
ach had been applied before the drug was
washed out. one possible explanation for this
could be that the hydrophobic long-chain macs
somehow entered the cell membrane and then
exerted their effects from the inner side of the
membrane. however, this possibility seems unlikely since no use- ( 4 / 4 ) or voltage-dependent
( 7 / 7 ) inhibition of ach-current was found when
the intrapipette solution contained iem-1078 or
iem-1194 (10 ~m). moreover, when a long-chain
mac (10 /xm) was present in the intrapipette

respectively. such a criterion reveals a possible
protecting effect even if there is some 'run-down'
of ach-current. representative results obtained
with the use of iem-1194 and iem-1405, iem1195, ach and  xxxd3439xxx  as protectors (none
of the protectors by itself produced any use-dependent effect) are shown in fig. 7. one can see
that both iem-1405 and ach failed to prevent
use-dependent block of ach-current by iem1194 (fig. 7a,c), while iem-1195 and  xxxd3439xxx  appeared to be effective protectors
(fig. 7b,d). similar results were obtained with
iem-1405 (100 #m, 5/5), iem-1195 (75-100 #m,
5/5), ach (100 gm, 3 / 3 ) and  xxxd3439xxx  (30
/~m, 4 / 4 ) in all neurons tested.

3.6. single-channel obsercations
in experiments using the cell-attached mode of
the patch-clamp method the effect of iem-1194
on the activity of a single nachr channel was
tested.
single-channel activity in normal solution was
represented by bursts of openings interrupted by
relatively long 'silent' intervals (data not shown,
see e.g. [6,13]). in control conditions, the mean
slope conductance of the single-channel currentvoltage relationship was 24.3 4- 0.8 ps (n = 6). in
the presence of iem-1194 (3-10 /xm) the channel openings became too rare to provide conclusive kinetic data on single-channel activity. however, the mean channel conductance, 22.9 + 0.6
ps (n = 12), was found not to differ significantly
from that in control ( p > 0.15).

4. discussion

the most interesting feature of long-chain
macs found in this work is their ability to bind
irreversibly to nachrs due to the presence of
the long aliphatic chain (decyl group) in their
structure. the decyl group seems to provide tight
hydrophobic interactions with a specific binding
site in the nachr. this suggestion is consistent
with the fact that it is possible to protect nachrs
from such irreversible binding with iem-1195 or
 xxxd3439xxx , which implies that the protector

can occlude the site at which the blocker binds.
this inference is also supported by the observation that triethyldecylammonium is 12 times more
potent as a ganglionic blocker than its analogue,
which possesses a second positive charge and is,
therefore, less hydrophobic [7]. it has also been
shown that more hydrophobic (long-chain) n-alcohols block nachrs from both muscle and electric organ much more strongly than short-chain
ones [14,27].
the irreversible binding of long-chain macs
to nachr is combined with their ability to block
the receptor reversibly, which is evidenced by the
use-dependent blockade. the fact that the action
of long-chain macs is also dose-dependent (no
block was observed at very low ach doses) suggests that the block occurs after the activation of
nachr. there are several states after the receptor activation such as intermediate ones, when
the channel is still closed (may include some
desensitized states), and active ones, when the
channel is open [6,13]. the strong voltage dependence of the blocking action, implying that
the blocking site is localized deep in the membrane electrical field, leads us to propose an
open-channel mechanism for this reversible usedependent block. on the other hand, the voltage
dependence of r, the time constant of dissociation of long-chain macs from the nachr, is not
monotonic, and peaks at - 5 0 mv. this may
indicate a mechanism more complex than 'plugging' the open channel, although the exact reason
underlying such an unusual voltage dependence
is not clear at the moment.
mechanisms other than open-channel block
may be proposed: enhancement by long-chain
macs of desensitization, modification of nachrs
resulting in a dramatic change in their properties,
or block of an intermediate state (an agonist is
bound to nachr but the channel is still closed)
in the activation scheme. it should be noted that
the exact mechanism of the inhibitory effect may
be hard to define. for example, the lifetime of a
blocking state is unusually long for long-chain
macs. assuming that the ic5o for iem-li178
(about 1 p.m) i s e q u a l t o k d and k b i s 3 x 111_2
s-j (see table 2), the rate constant for the binding to the open channel, k+b, is 3 × 104 m-~s ~.

d.e. kurenny et al. /journal ¢?f the autonomic nerl'ous @stem 48 (1994) 231-240

in the presence of a blocker the mean lifetime of
the activated n a c h r (open channel) is shortened
from % (where % = l / a , see [3]) to ~'l = % / ( 1 +
k+b[b]%). the relative decrease in the lifetime
can be calculated as ( % - rl)/'c 1 = k+b[b] %. in
an earlier study of n a c h r kinetics in these neurons two open states were found with % values
of about 0.15 and 1 ms [6]. in the presence of
iem-1078 at a concentration of 10/xm (10 times
higher than k d) the relative decrease in % is
about 0.005% and 0.03%, respectively. the relative decrease in corrected mean open time (0.86
ms, see [13]) is expected to be 0.026%. obviously,
such a small effect cannot be revealed by conventional methods. therefore, it seems impossible to
prove directly the open-channel blocking mechanism for long-chain macs.
the fact that only macs with long hydrophobic chains caused an irreversible block of n a c h r
suggests that there is a hydrophobic binding site
on or near the receptor. this binding site seems
to be located close to the ach binding site,
although it is not the same, since  xxxd3439xxx , a
competitive antagonist of ach ([1,22]; a.a.
selyanko, d.e. kurenny, v.a. derkach and v.i.
skok, unpublished data) does, while ach does
not, prevent the irreversible binding of long-chain
macs to nachrs. nooney et al. have recently
described a similar ability of  xxxd3439xxx  to
prevent long-lasting block by k-bungarotoxin of
n a c h r s of chromaffin cells [15], which are believed to be similar to neuronal cells (e.g. [4]).
they also concluded that the toxin binds to a
specific region in the n a c h r overlying the binding site for ach. earlier, sah et al. [17] using
toxin f (k-bungarotoxin) and sorenson et al. [26]
using lophotoxin showed that irreversible block of
synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia might
be accounted for by very tight binding of the
drugs to nachrs at a site which is located close
to an ach-binding site, as d- xxxd3456xxx  or dihydro-/3-erythroidine, competitive antagonists,
prevented such an irreversible effect [17,26].
the observations that (i) all long-chain macs
are able to block n a c h r s irreversibly, (ii) the
kinetics of use-dependent action vary among
macs possessing the same long aliphatic chain
but different a m m o n i u m heads, and (iii) the use-

239

dependent blocking effect persists after removing
long-chain macs from the solution, suggest the
following scheme for the action of long-chain
macs on nachrs: the long hydrophobic chain
allows the m a c to bind irreversibly to the receptor, which positions the channel-blocking moiety
of the m a c (the ammonium head) close to the
channel, where it can inhibit n a c h r activity
through an open-channel blocking mechanism.
the mechanisms underlying the local anesthetic effects of similar compounds, long-chain
derivatives of tetraethylammonium (tea), were
studied by scurlock and curtis [18]. two major
differences can be noted between the action of
those compounds and long-chain macs used in
the present work. first, indirect evidence was
found that long-chain t e a derivatives block
sodium or potassium channels in rat trigeminal
and frog sciatic nerve by acting from the inner
side of the m e m b r a n e [5,18]. in contrast, longchain macs were found here to block nachrs
exclusively from the outer side of the membrane.
second, the concentrations of long-chain t e a
derivatives causing 100% block of compound action potentials in frog sciatic nerve were (i.5-5
mm (lower concentrations were ineffective, see
[5]), whereas long-chain macs caused considerable inhibition of ach-current at concentrations
of 1 - 1 0 / x m .
it was mentioned in the introduction that
long-chain macs exert their unusual long-lasting
ganglion blocking effects when tested in whole
animals as well as in isolated organs [25]. these
findings are consistent with the ability of the
drugs to bind irreversibly to nachrs. this unique
feature of long-chain macs may allow us to
consider them as very effective and selective ganglion-blocking agents.
