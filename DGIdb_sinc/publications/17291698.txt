abstract
cochlear noise injury is the second most frequent cause of sensorineural hearing loss, after aging. because calcium dysregulation is a
widely recognized contributor to noise injury, we examined the potential of calcium channel blockers to reduce noise-induced hearing
loss (nihl) in mice. we focused on two t-type calcium blockers,  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx , which are anti-epileptics approved
by the food and drug administration. young c57bl/6 mice of either gender were divided into three groups: a ‘prevention’ group
receiving the blocker via drinking water before noise exposure; a ‘treatment’ group receiving the blocker via drinking water after noise
exposure; and controls receiving noise alone.  xxxd3438xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced nihl when applied before noise exposure, as determined by auditory brainstem recording. both  xxxd2056xxx  and  xxxd3438xxx  were eﬀective in reducing nihl when applied after noise
exposure. results were inﬂuenced by gender, with males generally receiving greater beneﬁt than females. quantitation of hair cell and
neuronal density suggested that preservation of outer hair cells could account for the observed protection. immunocytochemistry and
rt-pcr suggested that this protection involves direct action of t-type blockers on a1 subunits comprising one or more cav3 calcium
channel types in the cochlea. our ﬁndings provide a basis for clinical studies testing t-type calcium blockers both to prevent and treat
nihl.

1. introduction
excessive noise is the predominant cause of permanent
sensorineural hearing loss. at least 30 million people in
the united states encounter hazardous levels of noise at
work, particularly in jobs such as construction, mining,
agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and in the military (le prell et al., this volume; bohnker et al., 2002;
henderson and salvi, 1998, 2003; seixas et al., 2005).

tinues to grow, moreover, partly due to growing popularity
of portable music players with highly eﬃcient headphones
(fligor and cox, 2004; serra et al., 2005). although several
promising approaches have been identiﬁed for reducing
nihl (lefebvre et al., 2002; niu and canlon, 2002;
kopke et al., 2005; lynch and kil, 2005; le prell et al., this
volume; gagnon et al., this volume), there are currently no
pharmacologic agents approved by the food and drug
administration (fda) for this purpose.
typically there are two phases of hearing loss after
noise, a temporary threshold shift (tts) that is most prominent in the ﬁrst 24 h, but may extend for 1–2 weeks, and
permanent threshold shift (pts) (clark, 1991; quaranta
et al., 1998; nordmann et al., 2000). previous studies have

h. shen et al. / hearing research 226 (2007) 52–60

suggested that tts and pts are two distinct phenomena
with diﬀerent cellular pathological changes. tts may
reﬂect reversible buckling of the pillar cell bodies (nordmann et al., 2000), temporary strial edema and reduction
of the endocochlear potential (hirose and liberman,
2003), or excitotoxic damage to aﬀerent ﬁbers (pujol and
puel, 1999). histopathologic correlates of pts include permanent stereocilia damage, hair cell loss, and degeneration
of aﬀerent ﬁbers in the organ of corti (slepecky, 1986;
saunders et al., 1991).
molecular mechanisms underlying nihl are only
partly known, but probably include dysregulation of calcium (lefebvre et al., 2002; le prell et al., this volume;
henderson et al., 2006). elevated intracellular calcium levels may impair mitochondrial function and compromise a
host of cellular functions (luer et al., 1996). calcium elevation aﬀects cell membranes by activation of phospholipase
a2 and c, resulting in hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, release of free  xxxd2154xxx  (farooqui et al., 2004) and
lipid peroxidation (sullivan et al., 2004). disturbance in
calcium homeostasis contributes to trauma-induced neuronal injury and age-related neuronal loss (zipfel et al., 2000;
toescu et al., 2004). in the noise-exposed cochlea, calcium
may participate in both hair cell and neuronal damage
(minami et al., 2004; lefebvre et al., 2002; pujol and puel,
1999). calcium homeostasis in hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (sgns) is maintained by regulatory proteins
such as calmodulin and calbindin (e.g., hansen et al., 2003;
hackney et al., 2005), and by several types of calcium
channels (niedzielski et al., 1997; morley et al., 1998;
parks, 2000; lopez et al., 2003). voltage-gated calcium
channels (vgccs) play a key role in calcium entry into
neurons and control various calcium-dependent functions,
including intracellular signaling and gene expression (snutch and reiner, 1992; fuchs, 1996; kochegarov, 2003;
errington et al., 2005). vgccs can be divided into two
groups: low-voltage activated calcium channels that
respond to small (10 mv) changes in the resting membrane potential, and high-voltage activated calcium channels that require stronger (30 mv) depolarization to
open (perez-reyes, 1998; lacinova et al., 2000; yunker
and mcenery, 2003; layton et al., 2005; triggle, 2006).
diltiazem, a blocker of l-type calcium channels (high-voltage activated channels) was reported to attenuate nihl
(heinrich et al., 1997). however, other studies (boettcher,
1996; ison et al., 1997; boettcher et al., 1998) have not supported any protective eﬀect of blocking l-type calcium
channels. recently, blockers of t-type calcium channels
(low-voltage activated channels) were found to prevent cisplatin-induced death of cochlear cells in vitro (so et al.,
2005). whether these agents are able to prevent or treat
nihl has not been tested. here we test the protective
actions against nihl of t-type calcium blockers  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx , anti-epileptic drugs approved
by the fda, when administered in drinking water to
inbred c57bl/6 mice. we show that both agents can
reduce nihl, whether applied before or after noise expo-

sure, although eﬃcacy may depend on gender. the primary
action of t-type calcium antagonists may be to promote
hair cell survival.
2. methods
2.1. animals
all animal procedures were approved by the animal
studies committee at washington university in st.
louis. the study included 44 male and female c57bl/
6j mice aged 2–3 months, purchased from the jackson
laboratory (bar harbor, me, usa). all mice were
housed three to ﬁve per cage in a noise-controlled environment on a 12 h light/dark cycle with light onset at
6:00 a.m.
2.2. drug application
animals were subject to one of two protocols, a ‘prevention’ protocol under which drugs were administered
prior to a single noise exposure, and a ‘treatment’ protocol wherein drugs were administered only after noise.  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx  were obtained from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo). pilot experiments led us to
select dosages of 200 mg/day/kg body weight for  xxxd3438xxx  and 1.5 g/day/kg body weight for  xxxd2056xxx .
dosages were kept constant throughout the experimental
period by monitoring the amount of water uptake and
body weight measured every three days. drinking water
containing the drug was kept in dark bottles and changed
every three days. animals in the prevention group
received  xxxd3438xxx  in their drinking water for three
weeks prior to noise. animals in the therapy group
received  xxxd3438xxx  or  xxxd2056xxx  beginning immediately after noise exposure in drinking water for two
weeks.
2.3. noise exposure
as described previously (e.g., ohlemiller et al., 2000),
noise exposures were performed in a foam-lined, doublewalled soundproof room (industrial acoustics). the noise
exposure apparatus consisted of a 21 · 21 · 11 cm wire
cage mounted on a pedestal inserted into turntable. the
cage was rotated at 1 revolution/80 s. a motorola
ksn1020a piezo ceramic speaker (four total) was attached
to each side of a metal frame surrounding the cage. opposing speakers were driven by independent channels of a
crown d150a power ampliﬁer. noise was generated by
two general radio 1310 generators and ﬁltered to 4.0–
45.0 khz by krohn-hite 3550 ﬁlters. the overall noise level
was measured at the center of the cage using a b&k 4135
1/4 in. microphone in a combination with a b&k 2231
sound level meter set to broadband (0.2 hz–70 khz). mice
were exposed in pairs at 110 db spl for 30 min.

2.4. auditory brainstem recording
auditory brainstem recording (abr) testing was performed prior to treatment, then 24 h and 2–3 weeks after
the noise exposure to estimate tts and pts, respectively. thresholds were obtained as described previously
(ohlemiller et al., 2000; bao et al., 2005). prior to testing, all mice were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg ketamine
and 15 mg/kg xylazine (i.p.). otoscopic examination
was performed to ensure that tympanic membranes were
normal. core temperature was maintained at
37.5 ± 1.0 c using a thermostatically-controlled heating
pad in conjunction with a rectal probe (yellow springs
instruments model 73a). platinum needle electrodes
(grass) were inserted subcutaneously just behind the
right ear, at the vertex, and in the back (ground). electrodes were led to a grass p15 diﬀerential ampliﬁer
(100–10,000 hz, ·100), then to a custom ampliﬁer providing another ·1000 gain, and digitized at 30 khz using
a cambridge electronic design micro1401 in conjunction with signal and custom signal averaging software operating on a 120 mhz pentium pc. sinewave
stimuli generated by a hp 3445 oscillator were shaped
by a custom electronic switch to 5 ms total duration,
including 1 ms rise/fall times. the stimulus was ampliﬁed
by a crown d150a ampliﬁer and output to a
ksn1020a piezo ceramic speaker. toneburst stimuli at
each frequency and level were presented 1000 times at
20/s. the minimum sound pressure level required for
visual detection of wave i was determined at each frequency using a 5 db minimum step size. to calibrate
sound stimuli, a b&k 4135 1/4 in. microphone was
placed where the ear would normally be located.
2.5. tissue processing for histology
all animals were sacriﬁced immediately after the ﬁnal
abr test. the methods for ﬁxing, processing and analyzing mouse cochleae are described elsewhere (ohlemiller
et al., 2000). brieﬂy, mice were perfused transcardially with
cold 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in
0.1 m phosphate buﬀer. both cochleae were isolated, the
stapes removed, and immersed in the same ﬁxative. complete exposure of the cochlea to the ﬁxative was ensured
by making a small hole at the apex of the cochlear capsule,
gently circulating the ﬁxative over the cochlea using a
transfer pipet. after decalciﬁcation in sodium edta, the
cochleae were post-ﬁxed in buﬀered 1% osmium tetroxide,
dehydrated in an ascending acetone series, and embedded
in epon.
2.6. morphometric analysis
because the protective eﬀects of t-type calcium antagonists might be exerted through hair cell survival, neuronal
survival, or both, we conducted analyses designed to detect
all three potential eﬀects.

2.6.1. hair cell counts
estimates of hair cell survival were obtained for four
drug-treated and four control mice, all male. to obtain
counts, embedded cochleae were dissected into roughly
half-turn segments and examined in  xxxd2648xxx  under
nomarski optics, using a calibrated ocular. three separate
inner hair cell (ihc) and outer hair cell (ohc) counts were
obtained from non-overlapping 100 lm segments in the
apex, upper base, lower base, and hook regions of the
cochlea. in two of the animals, counts were made at a
higher spatial resolution (ou et al., 2000), and the percentage of missing ihcs and ohcs was determined by dividing
the number of missing hair cells by the total number of hair
cells (i.e. present plus absent) in the organ of corti.
2.6.2. neuronal counts
spiral ganglion neuron counts were obtained for 14
male mice (eight drug-treated, eight control). cochleae
were cut in the mid-modiolar plane at 4.0 lm. in every second section though a total 50 sections per animal, the number of sgn nuclei in the apex, upper base, and lower base
were counted under a 200· ﬁeld using a computerized planimetry program (image pro plus, media cybernetics).
because all sections were cut in the same orientation, it
was possible to compare two groups by mann–whitney
test.
2.7. immunocytochemical staining
the cochleae were cryoprotected in 20% glycerol in pbs
at 20 c. the tissue was embedded in tissue-tek optimal
cutting temperature (oct) compound (sakura, usa) on
dry ice. frozen sections of 10 lm were cut dorsal to ventral
through the cochlea, in the sagittal plane relative to the
head. sections were rinsed in pbs and permeabilized in
0.3% triton x-100 for 20 min. tissues were blocked in
5% normal goat serum in pbs for 30 min and then incubated in the primary antibody for the a1g (chemicon,
usa), a1h (santa cruz biotech. usa), or a1i (chemicon,
usa) at 1:100–1:1000 dilutions overnight at 4 c. for
diaminobenzidine (dab) method, the tissue was processed
using a vectastain elite avidin-biotin peroxidase kit (vector laboratories, usa) with dab as the chromogen.
images were captured using a nikon microscope or a confocal microscope with lasersharp2000 program (biorad).
2.8. real-time rt-pcr
total rna from cochlea at each animal was extracted
using rnaqueous (ambion). to avoid any dna contamination during rna extraction, at the ﬁnal step of extraction, one microliter of dnase i was added to 49 ll elution
buﬀer to extract total rna from an rna extraction column. the solution was incubated at 37 c for 15 min and
heated to 100 c for 5 min to kill the dnase i. then the
rna was quantiﬁed with ribogreen rna quantization

h. shen et al. / hearing research 226 (2007) 52–60

reagent (molecular probes, eugene, or). prior to reversetranscription to generate cdna, the quality of rna was
determined by checking ribosomal rna integrity on a
3% denatured agarose gel. ten microliters of total 50 ll
rna were reverse-transcribed in total 20 ll using random
hexamers and superscript ii reverse transcriptase (invitrogen, ca). standard curves for  xxxg861xxx  and three a1 subunits were made using their respective cdna plasmids at
ﬁve dilutions. primers used for real-time rt-pcr of these
mouse genes were:
 xxxg861xxx : 5-cctggccaaggtcatccatgacaac-3 and 5-tgtcataccaggaaatgagcttgac-3;
a1g subunit: 5-aatggcaagtcggcttcagg-3
and 5-tgtcagagaccatggacaccag-3;
a1h subunit: 5-atgttccggccctgtgagga-3
and 5-ccatgacgtagtacatgatgtcc-3;
a1i subunit: 5-atctgctccctgtcgg-3 and 5gagaactgggtcgctatg-3.
pcr protocols of the lightcycler system for  xxxg861xxx 
and each a1 subunit were optimized with the lightcycler
faststart dna masterplus sybr green i kit (roche).
two microliters of each 20 ll cdna were added in a
20 ll pcr reaction mixture containing 1· pcr buﬀer,
0.5 lm each primer, and master mix from the kit. the
number of pcr cycles when the ﬂuorescence intensity
exceeds a predetermined threshold was measured automatically during pcr. quantiﬁcation of the initial amount of
template molecules was achieved by calculating this number of pcr cycles with the number from the standard samples. the diﬀerence in the initial amount of total rna
among the samples was normalized in every assay using
the house keeping gene,  xxxg861xxx . besides using melting
curve analysis in the program of the lightcycler system
to ensure the right pcr product, we also examined each
pcr product on a 3% agarose gel after each experiment.

3. results
3.1. post-exposure application of t-type blockers
no diﬀerence by treatment in pre-exposure abr thresholds was noted for any test condition (see figs. 1–3). male
mice treated with  xxxd3438xxx  after noise exposure
showed modest (10 db) but signiﬁcantly smaller tts
compared to controls (p = 0.001 overall by two-way
anova, no interactions) (‘24 h’ in fig. 1a). signiﬁcant
protection was not achieved in female mice (fig. 1b). a
similar pattern was found for the pts, such that threshold
shifts were 10 db less in male mice treated with  xxxd3438xxx  than in controls (p = 0.003, no interactions) (‘2 w’
in fig. 1a), while no diﬀerence was indicated for female
mice (fig. 1b). male mice receiving  xxxd2056xxx  after
noise exposure showed protection similar to that aﬀorded
by  xxxd3438xxx  (fig. 2). protection from tts (24 h)
was suggested, but did not achieve signiﬁcance. pts, however, was 10–20 db less than in controls (3 w) (p = 0.001,
no interactions).

thresholds (mean ± sd) are shown for male mice (n = 5) aged 3 months.
signiﬁcant protection from pts only (3 w) was found in mice versus
controls (two-way anova, no interactions).

3.2. pre-exposure application of  xxxd3438xxx 
we next tested whether  xxxd3438xxx  could reduce
nihl when applied prior to noise exposure. analysis of
variance showed no signiﬁcant reduction in tts versus
controls in male but not female mice (‘24 h’ in fig. 3a,
b). in both males and females, however,  xxxd3438xxx 
reduced pts by 10–20 db (‘2 w’ in fig. 3a, b) (p 6 0.004
overall by two-way anova with p < .05 for diﬀerences
at 20 khz in males and 28.3 khz in females by tukey test).

found for both males and females receiving  xxxd3438xxx  two weeks
before noise exposure (two-way anova with p < .05 for diﬀerences at
20 khz in males and 28.3 khz in females by tukey test*).

the eﬃcacy of  xxxd3438xxx  in females when applied prior
to noise therefore stands in apparent contrast to the lack of
any eﬀect when applied after noise.

and ohc in the hook region (most basal 1 mm), lower base (lb), upper
base (ub), and apex of the cochlea in 3-month-old male mice (n = 3 for
each group). there was a signiﬁcant overall diﬀerence in ohc preservation by treatment (p = 0.024 by two-way anova with p < .05 for
diﬀerences in the hook by tukey test*). (b). counts of sgns (±sd) in
cochlear apex, middle, and base from the same mice as in a. sgn density
was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent by treatment (t-test).

3.3. histological ﬁndings
hair cell counts in male mice treated with  xxxd3438xxx 
after noise exposure showed signiﬁcant preservation of
outer hair cells in the cochlear base in treated mice versus
controls (p = 0.024 overall by two-way anova with
p < .05 for diﬀerences in the hook region by tukey test)
(fig. 4a). no diﬀerence was found for inner hair cells.
there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence by treatment in the
number of sgns between the control and trimethadionetreated mice (fig. 4b), nor between controls and mice treated with  xxxd2056xxx  (fig. 5).
with the exception of the hook region (most basal
0.8 mm), neither drug-treated nor control animals typically showed a clear relation between abr thresholds
and the number of surviving hair cells after noise. fig. 6
illustrates this point using highly contrasting examples of
a control mouse and a mouse given  xxxd3438xxx  prior
to noise exposure. the control shows >25 db of permanent
abr threshold shift at most frequencies, compared to
<25 db in the treated mouse. the control showed 22%
missing ihcs and 75% loss of ohcs in the deep basal

mouse. these data are consonant with an overall pattern
of better hair cell preservation in drug-treated mice, and
there is agreement between hair cell and abr data in the
extreme base. however, while lower frequency regions

either animal.

featured better threshold preservation in the treated mouse,
hair cell losses were similar (<1% and 5% loss of ihcs and
ohcs respectively in the control versus 2% and 4% loss of
ihcs and ohcs in the drug-treated mouse).
3.4. presence of t-type calcium channels in the cochlea
the molecular target for the protection of nihl by
t-type calcium blockers is expected to be t-type calcium
channels in the cochlea. the family of t-type calcium channels is composed of three members ( xxxg307xxx ,  xxxg308xxx , and
 xxxg309xxx ) based on their respective main pore-forming alpha
subunits: a1g, a1h, or a1i (perez-reyes, 1998; lacinova
et al., 2000; yunker and mcenery et al., 2003). so et al.
(2005) showed the presence of a1g mrna for the
 xxxg307xxx  channel in the p2 rat organ of corti. it was not
determined in that study whether a subunits for all three
diﬀerence t-type calcium channels were present in the
mature cochlea. we performed immunostaining on
cochlear sections from 2-month-old c57bl/6j mice using
antibodies against each subunit. sgns showed robust
immunoreactivity for the a1h subunit, while weak staining
was found for both a1g and a1i subunits (fig. 7a). by
contrast, weak expression of the a1g and a1i subunits
but not the a1h subunit (data not shown) was observed
in the organ of corti. the expression of the a1g subunit
was found in ihcs, pillar cells, deiters cells, and ohcs,

and the expression of the a1i subunit was found in ohcs
and deiters’ cells (fig. 7b). using real-time rt-pcr, we
also examined the expression level of mrnas encoding
the three a subunits in whole cochlea of 2-month-old mice
(fig. 7c). consistent with immunostaining results, the
expression level of the a1h subunit in the cochlea appeared
the highest of the three subunits, with mrna levels more
than twofold higher than that of the a1g subunit and
100-fold higher than that of the a1i subunit. the ratio
between each a1 subunit and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) was 3.49 · 10 3 (sd ± 4.1 ·
10 3) for the a1g subunit, 8.18 · 10 3 (±17.6 · 10 3) for
the a1h subunit, and 4.29 · 10 5 (±8.58 · 10 5) for the
a1i subunit. no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in the
expression level of each subunit between male and female
mice (t-test; n = 7 for each group; p = 0.976, 0.174, and
0.09 for the a1g, a1h, and a1i respectively) (fig. 7c).
the type and placement of t-type calcium channels in
the cochlea appear consistent with an eﬀect of t-type
blockers that is directed at cochlea, and the speciﬁc to
the organ of corti and/or spiral ganglion.
4. discussion
our data indicate that blockers of t-type calcium channels can reduce both temporary and permanent threshold
shifts caused by noise exposure in c57bl/6j mice. since

which carry the cdh23ahl allele, may have impacted our
results, insofar as this allele increases the extent of noise
injury, and cdh23 may bind calcium (davis et al., 2001,
2003). it is possible that our results will prove speciﬁc to
b6 mice. recent studies have highlighted diﬀerences completely unrelated to cdh23 in the response to noise of b6
and other strains such as cba/j (ohlemiller, 2006; gagnon et al., this volume).

mean (+sd) ratio between each  xxxg216xxx  and  xxxg861xxx  in female and
male groups was shown (n = 6 for each group; t-test; p = 0.976, 0.174, and
0.09 for the a1g, a1h, and a1i, respectively).

these blockers are anti-convulsant drugs already approved
by the fda, they may be appropriate for testing in a clinical setting for protection against permanent nihl in
humans. importantly, protection could be observed for
drug administration after noise exposure. recent evidence
suggests that noise injury represents an ongoing process,
beginning during exposure, but extending for days beyond
(see le prell et al., this volume). agents that can be eﬀectively administered after noise exposure probably interfere
with delayed, perhaps reversible, steps in the injury cascade. such agents also oﬀer added practicality, since potentially injurious exposure will often be recognized only after
it has occurred.
4.1. consideration of the animal model
we chose b6 mice for study because these mice share the
background of knockout and transgenic models we hope to
test to support the present ﬁndings. the use of b6 mice,

the principal cochlear targets of most permanent noise
injury are hair cells and aﬀerent neurons, although most
neuronal loss may be secondary to hair cell loss (slepecky, 1986; saunders et al., 1991; robertson, 1983;
pujol and puel, 1999). outer hair cells, especially, may
be either lost or non-lethally damaged by noise (e.g.,
hunter-duvar and elliott, 1972; liberman and kiang,
1978; ou et al., 2000). quantitation of both hair cells
and neurons indicated signiﬁcant protection by  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx  only for outer hair cells, and
primarily in the cochlear base. we therefore propose that
the cellular basis of protection by t-type calcium blockers
on nihl is preservation of ohc function and survival.
consistent with this, hair cells and supporting cells
appeared to express both a1g and a1i calcium channel
subunits.  xxxd2125xxx , another t-type calcium channel
blocker, was shown previously to inhibit cisplatin-induced
death of cultured auditory cells (so et al., 2005). in that
study, however, the mechanism was proposed to be inhibition of lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial permeability transition, not blockage of t-type calcium channels.
experiments combining pharmacological and transgenic
approaches may help narrow the molecular targets for
 xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx  and other t-type
blockers.
4.3. t-type calcium channel blockers and gender diﬀerence
gender diﬀerences we observed in the protection against
nihl aﬀorded by  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx  could
be an artifact of small sample sizes by gender, or may be
due to diﬀerent cochlear expression levels of the a1h channel subunit between male and female mice. rt-pcr
revealed a nearly signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the expression
level of a1i between male and female mice at two months
of age. notably, a previous study also yielded gender diﬀerences in the eﬃcacy of calcium blockers. an apparent delay
of presbycusis in patients taking calcium blockers for other
illnesses was found only in females (mills et al., 1999). we
observed the a1i subunit only in sgns, which showed no
enhanced survival in treated animals, and are not expected
to account for most permanent nihl. it is therefore not
clear that diﬀerences in the expression of the a1i subunit
can explain gender-speciﬁc aspects of the present or previous results.

4.4. conclusions
blockers of t-type calcium channels reduce permanent
nihl in c57bl/6j mice. molecular mechanisms underlying this functional beneﬁt remain unclear, but may
involve direct action of blockers on the a1g and/or a1i
subunits of one or more cav3 calcium channels in hair
cells or supporting cells. since blockers for t-type calcium channels are anti-convulsant drugs approved by
the fda to treat epilepsy, they may be appropriate for
tests in the clinical setting to treat and prevent nihl
in humans.
