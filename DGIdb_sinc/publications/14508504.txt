polyamines (putrescine, spermidine,  xxxd3234xxx ) are ubiquitous, simple molecules that interact with a
variety of other molecules in the cell, including nucleic acids, phospholipids and proteins. various studies
indicate that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth and differentiation. furthermore, these
molecules, especially  xxxd3234xxx , have been shown to modulate ion channel activities of certain cells.
nonetheless, little is known about the specific cellular functions of these compounds, and extensive
laboratory investigations have failed to identify a heritable condition in humans in which polyamine
synthesis is perturbed. we report the first polyamine deficiency syndrome caused by a defect in  xxxd3234xxx 
synthase (sms). the defect results from a splice mutation, and is associated with the snyder–robinson
syndrome (srs, omim_309583), an x-linked mental retardation disorder. the affected males have mild-tomoderate mental retardation (mr), hypotonia, cerebellar circuitry dysfunction, facial asymmetry, thin
habitus, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, decreased activity of sms, correspondingly low levels of intracellular
 xxxd3234xxx  in lymphocytes and fibroblasts, and elevated spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  ratios. the clinical features
observed in srs are consistent with cerebellar dysfunction and a defective functioning of red nucleus
neurons, which, at least in rats, contain high levels of  xxxd3234xxx . additionally, the presence of mr reflects a
role for  xxxd3234xxx  in cognitive function, possibly by  xxxd3234xxx ’s ability to function as an ‘intrinsic gateway’
molecule for inward rectifier k þ channels.

introduction
polyamines are found ubiquitously in cells.1 they are
synthesized by the actions of two aminopropyltransferases.
these are spermidine synthase, which converts putrescine
into spermidine, and  xxxg2181xxx  (sms), which
converts spermidine into  xxxd3234xxx . both enzymes use
decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx  as the aminopropyl

donor. the synthesis of polyamines is tightly regulated by
alterations in the activities of the key enzymes ornithine
decarboxylase and  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase.2,3
although they are simple molecules, polyamines appear to
interact with a variety of molecules in the cell, including
nucleic acids, phospholipids and protein.1,3 polyamines
have been implicated in many critical cellular processes
including transcription, translation and alterations in enzymatic activities. polyamines, particularly  xxxd3234xxx , have
also been shown to modulate ion channel activities.4,5 it is

clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth
and differentiation. inactivation of either the ornithine
decarboxylase or the  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase
genes in mice is lethal at early embryonic stages.6,7
a mouse model exists for sms deficiency. the gy mouse,
in which this enzyme is deleted, exhibits neurological
findings such as inner ear abnormalities, deafness hyperactivity and a circling behavior.8 additionally, the gy
mouse has hypophosphatemic rickets and deletion of the
50 end of the  xxxg1738xxx  gene.9 however, it is unlikely that the
deletion of  xxxg1738xxx  contributes to the neurological findings,
since two other mouse models for x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, the hyp mouse10 and the ska1 mouse,11
do not have neurological symptoms. therefore, although
little is known about the specific cellular function of
 xxxd3234xxx , it was hypothesized that the neurological
abnormalities found in gy males were due to the
deficiency of  xxxd3234xxx .8 to test this hypothesis, mutation
analysis of the human sms gene, using denaturing highpressure liquid chromatography (dhplc) technology, was
undertaken in nine x-linked mental retardation (xlmr)
families: five published families (snyder – robinson syndrome (srs),12 say syndrome,13 mrx33,14 mrx59,15
mrx7316) and four unpublished families linked to the
xp22.1 region of the x chromosome. in the srs family, a
point mutation, giving rise to aberrant splicing associated
with decreased levels of sms and cellular deficiency of
 xxxd3234xxx , was identified. this result represents the first
human disorder linked to an inborn error of polyamine
metabolism.

methods
rt-pcr
total rna from epstein – barr virus (ebv)-transformed
lymphoblastoid cell lines was isolated using trizol (life
technologies), and first-strand synthesis was performed

using the super script first-strand synthesis system for rtpcr (invitrogen). rt-pcr was performed in a 20 ml reaction
volume containing 10 mm of each primer (exons 3 – 6f and
exons 3 – 6r, table 1), 250 mm of dntps, 1  pcr buffer
(sigma) and 1 u of taq polymerase (sigma) with 0.02 mm of
taqstartt antibody (clontech). pcr conditions were
initial denaturation at 951c for 5 min followed by 30
cycles of 951c for 30 s, 651c for 30 s and 721c for 30 s, with
a final extension at 721c for 5 min.

sequencing
pcr amplicons from genomic dna were gel purified using
a qiaquickt gel extraction kit (qiagen). the purified
dna was sequenced using an automated laser florescence
(alf) dna sequencer (amersham pharmacia biotech),
using the thermosequenase cyt5 dye terminator kit
(amersham pharmacia biotech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
rt-pcr amplicons were subcloned using the ta-cloning
kit (invitrogen), and dna from insert positive colonies
were purified using a qiaprep spin miniprep kit (250)
(qiagen). sequencing was carried out on the alf as
above, using primers exons 3 – 6f and exons 3 – 6r (table 1).
sequence alignments and analyses were accomplished
using the dnastar program (dnastar).
dhplc analysis
genomic dna was amplified in a final reaction volume of
35 ml using 50 ng, 1  of the appropriate pcr buffer
(table 1), 2.0 mm dntps, 1.0 mm primers, 1 u taq polymerase (sigma) and 0.02 mm taq antibody (clontech). the
pcr conditions were initial denaturation at 951c for 5 min
followed by 30 cycles of 951c for 30 s, the appropriate
annealing temperature (table 1) for 30 s and 721c for 30 s,
with a final extension of 721c for 5 min.
for dhplc analysis, 10 ml each from two males with
mental retardation (mr) were mixed together and then

heteroduplexed. as a control, dna from two random
males were mixed together and then heteroduplexed.
dhplc was performed on a wave dna fragment analysis
system (transgenomic) containing a dnasep column
(transgenomic) held at the appropriate temperature for
the particular amplicon (table 1).

haeiii digestion
a haeiii restriction endonuclease site was created in the
sequence containing 329 þ 5 g4a, by utilizing a primer to
substitute a g for a t at position 329 þ 6.3 genomic dna
(50 ng) was amplified in a final reaction volume of 35 ml,
using 1  mastep amp k buffer (epicenter) 2.0 mm dntps,
1.0 mm primers (exon 4f1 50 ctgtcaacatggcctcagtcgtt 30 and
exon 4(a)r 50 aaggacattcaagagtggc 30 ), 1 u taq polymerase
(sigma) and 0.02 mm taq antibody (clontech). the pcr
conditions were 951c for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of
951c for 30 s, 531c for 30 s and 721c for 30 s, with a final
extension of 721c for 7 min. the reaction (10 ml) was then
diluted to 20 ml with 10 ml of 2  haeiii digestion buffer
(new england biolabs), 2  bsa (bovine  xxxg124xxx )
and 2  spermidine. haeiii (1 ml; 10 000 u/ml, new england biolabs) was added, and the digestion was carried out
at 371c overnight. after digestion, 10 ml was loaded on a
2.5% agarose gel (seakens le, biowhittaker molecular
applications) to separate the fragments.
polyamine analysis
for both lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts, the cells
were washed twice with pbs and harvested in 0.4 ml of
chilled 0.3 m perchloric acid, and freeze – thawed twice.
after centrifugation at 12 000 g for 5 min at 41c, 0.3 ml of
the supernatant was used for polyamine analysis, and the
pellet was dissolved in 0.4 ml of 0.3 m naoh for protein
determination, using bio-rad reagent with bsa as a
standard.17 polyamines were separated and quantified by
hplc with a postcolumn derivation to form fluorescent
products.18,19
sms activity
sms assays were carried out using the method previously
reported, in which the production of [35s]- xxxd2619xxx  from [35s]dcadomet and spermidine was measured.20 cells were harvested using spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx 
synthase assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7.2,
0.3 mm edta, 10 mm  xxxd26xxx ), and subjected to
snap – freeze – thaw procedure three times. cell extracts
were then centrifuged at 41c for 20 min at 12 000 g, before
pooling the cytosolic extracts together. protein measurements were carried out using bio-rad reagent with bsa as a
standard.18
for sms assays, cell extracts were added to an assay mix
(500 mm spermidine, 100 mm sodium phosphate, ph 7.5,
20 mm s-adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thio-octane (adodato),
[35s]dcadomet 40 000 cpm of radioactivity per assay mix),

and the reaction took place in a total volume of 200 ml.
adodato, which is a transition-state-analogue inactivator
of spermidine synthase,21 was added to prevent any
spermidine synthase from contributing to the production
of  xxxd2619xxx . reactions were carried out at
371c for 1 h.

results
the exon/intron boundaries of the 11 exons of sms were
determined by blast 2 analysis of the mrna sequence
(xm_054938) and genomic sequence (nt_011530). primers were designed using dnastar (table 1). dhplc
analysis detected an altered migration of the exon 4
amplicon in family k8145 (figure 1a). the other eight
probands were normal by this analysis. sequence analysis
of exon 4 from k8145 revealed a single base substitution,
g-a, at position þ 5 of the 50 splice site of intron 4
(329 þ 5 g4a) (figure 1b). since the alteration did not
create or destroy any restriction endonuclease site, a
modified primer was designed to create a haeiii site
(ggcc/ccgg) in the altered sequence, by substituting a
g for a t at position 329 þ 6.22 using haeiii digestion, it
could be shown that the 329 þ 5 g4a change in k8145
segregated with affected status (figure 1c). utilizing the
haeiii digestion, the change was not observed in 480 x
chromosomes from normal adult males, indicating that it
was not likely a rare polymorphism.23

sms gene analysis
based on the segregation and population data, further
analysis of the 329 þ 5 g4a nucleotide alteration was
conducted. the g-a substitution changed the splice
consensus sequence at the exon 4/intron 4 boundary from
cggtaagt to cggtaaat, with a concomitant lowering of the
splice consensus value (cv) from 0.91 to 0.77.24 owing to
the reduction in the cv, rt-pcr analysis, using primers in
exons 3 and 6 (table 1), was performed on cdna isolated
from lymphoblastoid cells of an affected male (iv-10;
figure 1c). two bands, one of the expected size and the
other smaller in size, were observed on agarose gel
electrophoresis from this male, while cdna from a normal
male exhibited only a single band of the expected size
(figure 2a). sequence analysis of the lower band in patient
iv-10 revealed the absence of exon 4, while sequence
analysis of the upper band was consistent with proper
splicing (figure 2b). the sequence of the smaller band is
predicted to produce a protein missing 22 amino acids
from exon 4, and 22 novel amino acids prior to truncation
at position 111 (figure 2c).
sms activity and  xxxd3234xxx  levels
to further substantiate the pathogenic nature of the

controls, due to a 50% reduction in  xxxd3234xxx  levels and a
75% increase in spermidine levels (table 2). to explore
whether this defect was limited to lymphocytes, skin
fibroblast cultures were established from two affected
males (iv-6, iv-9, figure 1c). abnormalities were noted in

sms activity, which was greatly reduced, as well as in the
spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  ratio and the levels of the individual
polyamines (table 2). thus, the  xxxd3234xxx  deficiency was
not limited to one cell type.

discussion
xlmr accounts for 10 – 15% of all cases of mr present in
humans.25 xlmr entities can be separated into two
groups: those that are syndromic, mrxs, and those that
are nonsyndromic,  xxxg22xxx .26 the separation is based on the
presence (mrxs) or absence ( xxxg22xxx ) of distinctive somatic,
metabolic neurological or behavioral features in association with the mr. both syndromal and nonsyndromal
forms of xlmr have been localized to all regions of the x
chromosome.27,28 molecular studies have begun to give
some idea of the number of genes on the x chromosome
that influence intelligence. in all, 33 genes have been
associated with syndromic xlmr and, in the case of
mecp2,  xxxg225xxx , arx, fgdy1,  xxxg101xxx  and  xxxg1988xxx , occasionally
with nonsyndromic xlmr. nine additional genes have
been associated with only nonsyndromic xlmr. a total of
47 additional xlmr syndromes have been mapped, but the
genes have not been identified, and over 50 xlmr
syndromes have yet to be mapped. also, the genes for 60
of the  xxxg22xxx  families, comprising 10 nonoverlapping
linkage regions, have yet to be identified.29
it is anticipated that most of the distinctive xlmr
syndromes will be caused by different genes, and that at
least 10 additional nonsyndromic xlmr genes will be
found. hence, a minimal estimate of the total number of
european journal of human genetics

xlmr genes, those that cause nonsyndromic and syndromic xlmr, will be in excess of 150, and thus represent at
least 11% of the genes on the x chromosome.30
family k8145 was initially reported by snyder and

robinson31
(omim_309583), in which affected males had hypotonia
and unsteady gait in addition to mr. in total, 11 males in
four generations had mild to moderate intellectual impairment. the syndrome was mapped to xp22 (maximal twopoint lod score of 4.2 for dxs989 located telomeric to the
duchenne muscular dystrophy locus).12 additional clinical
findings at the time of the last follow-up in 1994 included
facial asymmetry, narrow or cleft palate, nasal dysarthric
speech, diminished muscle mass, kyphoscoliosis, osteoporosis and long great toes.12 recent clinical evaluations
from 2002 found the affected males to have an unsteady
gait, movement disorder and some seizures. in selected
individuals, microscopic examination of muscle, ekg,
brain mri and serum electrolytes were normal. two males
(iii-9, iv-4) out of four had abnormal electroencephalograms.
it is noteworthy that the marked reduction in sms seen
in the cell lines from snyder – robinson patients was not
associated with a parallel reduction in  xxxd3234xxx , or in the
total polyamine content of the cells (table 2). however, the
spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  ratio was more than doubled, suggesting that compensatory changes in other enzymes in
the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, which is known to be
very highly regulated,2,3 occur to maintain some level of

 xxxg2181xxx  defect
al cason et al

943
 xxxd3234xxx  at the expense of reducing putrescine and
increasing spermidine. further studies will be needed to
identify the nature of the compensatory changes, but an
increased supply of decarboxylated  xxxd3156xxx 
is a likely alteration, since  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase is known to be repressed by  xxxd3234xxx .32,33
treatment with low levels of inhibitors of sms leads to
changes in polyamines similar to those seen in the cell
lines from snyder – robinson patients with a decrease in
putrescine, an increase in spermidine and a fall in
 xxxd3234xxx .18,19 such inhibitor exposure does lead to an
increase in  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase activity.33
it is possible that the extent of reduction in sms activity
in the tissues of snyder – robinson males varies with the
cell type under consideration, since the degree to which
the small extent of correct splicing occurs may depend on
cellular factors. it is also possible that the degree to which
the compensatory changes described above are able to
normalize the  xxxd3234xxx  levels despite the reduction in sms
are tissue or cell dependent. however, it is very likely that
there is a general alteration in polyamine levels in the
tissues of affected males with reductions in putrescine and
 xxxd3234xxx , and an increase in spermidine similar to those
seen in the fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cells. in view of
the many well-documented effects of polyamines on cell
growth differentiation and neurological function,34 – 36
these changes are likely to be responsible for the snyder –
robinson phenoptype.

329 þ 5 g4a mutation in sms is less severe than the
phenotype of the gy mutant mouse: circling behavior,
inner ear abnormalities, deafness, hyperactivity, small at
birth, reduced viability.8,37 this difference may be because
(1) the mutation in k8145 substantially reduced the
amount of normal  xxxd3234xxx  but did not totally eliminate
its production, as observed in the gy mouse,8,37 and (2) the
gy mutant results from the deletion of both sms and  xxxg1738xxx ,
which may compound the phenotype expected from the
deletion of only sms.8
however, although the clinical presentation of the
patients is different from that observed in the gy mouse,
it is consistent with localization data for  xxxd3234xxx  obtained
in the rat.38 using immunocytochemical methods, laube
et al38 demonstrated a lack of ubiquitous staining of
spermidine/ xxxd3234xxx  in the adult rat brain. the strongest
neuronal staining was observed in the hypothalamic
paraventricular, supraoptic and accessory neurosecretory
nuclei, while strong cytoplasmic staining was seen in the
mesencephalic trigeminal tract, the red nucleus and large
motor neurons of the spinal cord.
relative to the clinical presentation, the red nucleus in
humans is an integral part of the cerebellar circuitry, which
affects balance, posture, motor coordination, locomotion,
tone, speech and possibly cognitive ability. patients with
snyder – robinson xlmr syndrome have an unsteady gait,

hypotonia and decreased muscle mass, speech abnormalities, and movement disorders consistent with cerebellar
circuitry/red nucleus dysfunction. although affected males
had normal microscopic muscle, ekg, serum electrolytes
and brain mri studies, these findings would not be
unexpected, since the  xxxd3234xxx  deficiency likely gives rise
to a neurotransmitter/circuitry problem.
previously, it had been noted that women in family
k8145 exhibited skewed x inactivation due to a promoter
mutation in the xist gene.39 the skewing ranged from
90:10 (iv-1) to 65:35 (v-1). since both of these women are
carriers of the 329 þ 5g4a mutation, it is clear the x
inactivation is not related to the sms mutation. furthermore, both women, who are mother and daughter, appear
similarly normal; hence, the x inactivation is not working
as a protective mechanism.
the deficiency of  xxxd3234xxx  in a family with the snyder –
robinson xlmr syndrome is the first clear indication of a
role for polyamines in brain development and cognitive
function. polyamines, particularly  xxxd3234xxx , have been
shown to modulate ion channel activities.4,5 our finding
supports the important role of  xxxd3234xxx  as an ‘intrinsic
gateway’ molecule for inward rectifier k þ channels. thus,
as intracellular levels of  xxxd3234xxx  decrease, so does the
excitability of the cell membrane.4 additionally, in other
cells with ampa receptors, excitability is increased along
with an increase in the ca2 þ flux causing ca2 þ overload.40
any one of these alterations, which could result either
from the reduction in  xxxd3234xxx  or the alteration in the
relative contents of the polyamines, is likely to adversely
affect the function of neuronal cells. although the level of
spermidine does increase, possibly to compensate for the
lower level of  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine does not adequately
substitute for  xxxd3234xxx , since its binding efficiency to k þ
channels is 100-fold less.40
at present, it is difficult to predict the frequency of sms
mutations in the male mr population. a screen of genomic
dna of 130 males with nonfragile x mr detected no
mutations. nonetheless, any male with mr of unknown
causation can now be tested for an elevated spermidine/
 xxxd3234xxx  ratio and a low level of sms.
based on the gy mutant phenotype, it may be that any
loss of function mutation in sms leads to lethality.
therefore, in addition to the male mr population, male
fetal deaths of unknown cause, male newborns with
hypotonia and exhibiting a failure to thrive, or males
who present with signs of cerebellar circuitry dysfunction
and some mental impairment, may warrant sms testing.
