abstract
breast cancer (bc) is linked to estrogen exposure. estradiol (e2 ) stimulates bc cells proliferation by binding the  xxxg730xxx  (er).
hormone-related cancers have been linked to estrogenic environmental contaminants. cadmium (cd) a toxic pollutant, acts as estrogens in bc
cells. purpose of our study was to evaluate whether cd regulates mcf-7 cell proliferation by activating  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt and pdgfr␣ kinases. cd
increased cell proliferation and the er-antagonist  xxxd2165xxx ,780 blunted it. to characterize an er-dependent mechanism, er␣/␤ expression was
evaluated. cd decreased er␣ expression, but not er␤. cd also increased  xxxg1369xxx /2, akt and pdgfr␣ phosphorylation while ici blocked it. since
stimulation of phosphorylation was slower than expected, c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes, and pdgfa were analyzed. cd rapidly increased
c-jun, c-fos and pdgfa expression. cells were also co-incubated with the cd and specific kinases inhibitors, which blocked the cd-stimulated
proliferation.
in conclusion, our results indicate that cd increases bc cell proliferation in vitro by stimulating akt,  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pdgfr␣ kinases activity
likely by activating c-fos, c-jun and pdgfa by an er␣-dependent mechanism.

1. introduction
breast cancer (bc) is the most common malignancy affecting
women and is the leading cause of death in women between the
ages of 35 and 45 years (stoica et al., 2000) despite improvements in both cancer prevention and pharmacological treatments. bc develops through multistep processes progressing
from hyperplasia to premalignant lesions, in situ carcinoma,
invasion, and distal metastasis, concomitantly with gain of oncogenic activities and loss of tumor suppressor gene functions
(russo and russo, 2001). long-term exposure to estrogens has
been linked to increased cell proliferation and thus, to both breast
and uterine cancer (clemons and goss, 2001). indeed the growth

and development of the mammary gland is under the control
of sex steroids and the increased proliferation of normal cells
induced long term exposure to estrogens has been suggested
to be a strong stimulus for tumors promotion in these organs
(yager, 2000).
however, the factors involved in the increased bc risk are
not fully known. interestingly, several studies suggest that exposure to pollutants and environmental endocrine disruptors might
play a role in the aetiology of the disease (lemen et al., 1976;
mclachlan, 2001a,b), and also the high incidence of hormonerelated cancers and diseases in the western world has been
related to environmental estrogens, able to bind and activate
ers in target tissues (mclachlan, 2001a,b; migliaccio and
anderson, 2003).
estrogenic actions are mediated by two specific intracellular estrogen receptors, er␣ and er␤, which belong to the
steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of transcription factors
(enmark and gustafsson, 1999; migliaccio and anderson,

m. brama et al. / molecular and cellular endocrinology 264 (2007) 102–108

2003) and act as hormone-dependent transcriptional regulators
(matthews and gustafsson, 2003).
interestingly the heavy metal cadmium (cd), which has been
classified among the most important carcinogens, has been
recently described to possess estrogen-like activity acting then
as a new endocrine disrupter (garcia-morales et al., 1994; stoica
et al., 2000). cd is one of the most toxic transition metal,
associated with air and water pollution, as well as cigarette
smoking. its potential harm has increased with the augmented
industrial usage of the element, i.e. battery (nordberg, 1972)
and for its long persistence (15–20 years), in the body. indeed,
there are several increasing evidences demonstrating the carcinogenicity of cd in both human and experimental animal
models (antila et al., 1996; beyersmann, 1994; beyersmann and
hechtenberg, 1997; goyer et al., 2004; waalkes, 2003). this pollutant increases dna synthesis, stimulates proto-oncogene and
transcription factors expression as well as stress proteins synthesis, up-regulates proinflammatory cytokines levels and several
kinases activity (beyersmann and hechtenberg, 1997; zheng et
al., 1996; dormer et al., 2000). kinases or transcription factors
are involved in pivotal roles of cell homeostasis such as regulation of cell growth and proliferation, metabolic responses,
migration, and apoptosis (beyersmann and hechtenberg, 1997;
zheng et al., 1996; dormer et al., 2000). constitutive activation of protein kinases, mainly by phosphorylation, induces cell
growth and proliferation, contributing to the development of
malignant phenotypes of several human cancers including bc
(zhang et al., 2005).
interestingly, intracellular er␣ elicits the well-known
genomic effects, while the putative membrane er␣ triggers
downstream mitogenic signaling via rapid activation of mitogenactivated protein kinases (mapks), and/or akt and/or plateletderived growth factor receptor ␣ (pdgfr␣) (geffroy et al.,
2005; lee et al., 2005; gray et al., 1995).
even though the mechanism(s) of action of the heavy metal
cd are not fully understood, it appears that the pollutant is able
to interact with receptor/ion channels increasing inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (ip3) formation and intracellular ca2+ mobilization (smith et al., 1994). also, cd binds thiols with high affinity
and substitutes for zinc in the cysteinyl clusters of many proteins including er␣ and it can substitute the zinc within receptor
(martin et al., 2003; predki and sarkar, 1992; stoica et al., 2000).
this pollutant, by the ability of binding ers, increases uterine
weight and  xxxg1737xxx  (pgr) expression (johnson et
al., 2003). thus, aim of our studies has been to evaluate whether
cd could stimulate bc proliferation and also to further characterize the intracellular signaling involved in the pollutant-induced
effect on bc cells in vitro.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture and treatments
human breast cancer cell lines mcf-7 were obtained from american type
culture collection (atcc, rockville, md) and grown in dmem high glucose
(euroclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (gibco brl, life technologies, inc., rockville,
md) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 , 95% air at 37 ◦ c. experiments were

103

performed in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% charcoal treated
calf bovine serum (cbs). cdcl2 (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo) was
dissolved in water and the stock solution sterilized by filtration. estradiol (e2 )
(sigma–aldrich co., st. louis, mo) was dissolved in ethanol and stock solution sterilized by filtration. the anti-estrogen  xxxd2165xxx ,780 was purchased from
zeneca pharmaceuticals, macclesfield (uk) and dissolved in ethanol. the kinase
inhibitors pd 98059 and ag18 were purchased from calbiochem (san diego,
ca) and dissolved in ethanol.  xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec) (signal transduction inhibitor 571) were kindly provided by dr. elisabeth buchdunger, novartis
pharmaceuticals, basel, switzerland and dissolved in water.

2.2. cell proliferation assay
mcf-7 cells proliferation was determined using a brdu incorporation
assay, utilizing a cell proliferation elisa kit (roche, mannheim, germany).
breast cancer cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at a density of
1 × 103 cells/well and preincubated for 24 h with phenol red free and 5% charcoal treated cbs. at the end of incubation the media were replaced by fresh
ones containing different treatments as described in section 3. medium was
changed every second day after the beginning of treatment. at the end of treatment medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 ◦ c with a
labelling solution containing brdu (10 ␮m) and then fixed with precooled fixation solution. dna was denatured for 30 min at 37 ◦ c with a nuclease solution,
followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 ◦ c with anti-brdu-pod, fab fragments.
cells were washed three times with pbs, and incubated with peroxidase substrate for 30 min at room temperature. the optical density of each sample was
measured at 450 nm using a sunrise microplate reader (tecan, durham, nc).

2.3. western blot analysis
mcf-7 cells were seeded in 60 mm plates at a density of 1 × 105 and preincubated for 24 h with phenol red free and 5% charcoal treated cbs. cells were then
stimulated, for different times, with different treatments as described in section
3. at the end of incubation, cells were washed with pbs, harvested and cell pellets were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm tris hcl (ph 7.5), 150 mm
nacl, 1 mm egta, 1 mm edta, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 mm
pmsf, 1 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin and 1% triton x-100. lysates were
loaded onto sds-polyacrylamide gels (7 and 12%) and then electrotransferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes which were incubated with specific primary antibodies against er␣, er␤, phospho-akt, phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, phospho-pdgfr␣,
akt,  xxxg1369xxx /2, pdgfr␣ and ␤-actin (santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz,
ca). membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody and detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl, amersham life science, arlington heights, il).

2.4. rna extraction and semiquantitative rt-pcr
mcf-7 cells were seeded in 24 mm plates and preincubated for 24 h with
phenol red free and 5% charcoal treated cbs. cells were then stimulated as
described in section 3. at the end of incubation, cells were washed twice with
cold pbs, and total rna was extracted using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). reverse transcription was performed by adding 2 ␮g total rna
and 0.5 ␮g oligo (dt) to 20 ␮l reaction buffer. rna was denatured by heating
to 70 ◦ c for 10 min. first strand buffer, 2 ␮l 0.1 m dtt, 1 ␮l 10 ␮m dntp mix
and 1 ␮l ribonuclease inhibitors (invitrogen) were added to the reaction tube followed by incubation at 42 ◦ c for 2 min. at the end of this reaction 200 units of
super script ii (invitrogen) were added and incubated at 42 ◦ c for 50 min. the
sequences of the pcr primers are listed in table 1. glyceraldehyde-3 phosphatedehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) was used as an internal reference.
band areas were analyzed using a bio-rad 670 scanning densitometer (hercules, ca, usa) and molecular analyst software. each value is expressed as
arbitrary densitometric units normalized against  xxxg861xxx .

2.5. statistical analysis

3. results and discussion
3.1. cadmium stimulates cell proliferation
to evaluate potential stimulation of bc cells proliferation by
cd, mcf-7 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well
and exposed for 2 or 7 days to e2 (10 nm) or cdcl2 (10 ␮m)
which resulted in a marked increase in cell proliferation, 70 and
40% of control, respectively, after 7 days of culture (fig. 1,
p < 0.05). to evaluate a potential er-dependent mechanism
in the cd-induced mcf-7 cell proliferation, cells were coincubated with  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m), a pure er antagonist that
produces a conformational change in the receptor, precluding

fig. 1. effects of e2 and cd on cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells.
mcf-7 cells were cultured as described in section 3, and treated with e2 (10 nm)
and cdcl2 (10 ␮m) alone or in the presence of  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m) for the
indicated times. cell growth was measured by brdu incorporation. the results
are expressed as percent (%) increase/decrease in brdu incorporation assuming
as 100% the incorporation in untreated cells (basal). results are expressed as
mean ± s.d. and are representative of two independent experiments performed

binding to estrogen responsive element (ere) (klotz et al.,
2000). the antagonist significantly blunted the cdcl2 -induced
cell proliferation (64%, p < 0.01) after 7 days of culture as shown
in fig. 1, suggesting that cd increases cell proliferation by
an er␣-dependent mechanism. moreover, to evaluate potential stimulation of breast tissue estrogen target genes by cd,
 xxxg1737xxx  (pgr) expression was evaluated. as also
demonstrated by others in uterine tissue (johnson et al., 2003),
cdcl2 (10 ␮m) significantly increased pgr expression in bc
cells (7-fold), suggesting that this pollutant can significantly
alter breast tissue homeostasis.
3.2. modulation of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  protein by cadmium
since previous data demonstrated that cd mimicked actions
of e2 in bc cells (garcia-morales et al., 1994) and since ici
182,780 blocked the cd-stimulated mcf-7 cells proliferation
(fig. 1), we determined whether cd might modulate ers expression in bc cells. to this aim, mcf-7 cells were incubated for
24 h with cdcl2 (10 ␮m) or e2 (10 nm) and er␣ and ␤ expression was measured by western blot analysis. as expected, cells
exposure to e2 decreased er␣ levels (40–50%), while it did not
affect er␤ expression (fig. 2a and b). interestingly, cd mimicked e2 effect, significantly decreasing er␣ expression (75%,
p < 0.01), but not modifying er␤ (fig. 2a and b), strongly indicating that the observed effects of cd in bc cells are mainly
linked to an er␣-dependent pathway.
3.3. cadmium stimulates akt phosphorylation
to further characterize the mechanism(s) by which cd
induces bc proliferation, intracellular pathways known to be
activated by estrogens and involved in cellular growth were evaluated. akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions as a
critical regulator of cell survival and cell growth (nicholson and
anderson, 2002; song et al., 2005), is activated by growth factors or cytokines through phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx -k)
and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk-1) activation
(bellacosa et al., 1998). interestingly, er␣ binds to the regulatory subunit (p85) of  xxxg1743xxx -k activating the akt/pkb (protein
kinase b) pathway.
thus, potential activation of akt by the estrogenic pollutant
cd was evaluated. to this aim, mcf-7 cells were treated with
cdcl2 (10 ␮m) for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h and levels of phospho-akt
were determined by western blot analyses. total akt levels were
unchanged at any of the time points (data not shown) but cdcl2
significantly increased, in a time-dependent manner, akt phosphorylation as detected by using a specific phospho-serine 473
akt antibody (fig. 3a). cdcl2 -induced maximum stimulation of
akt activity after 6 h (3.3-fold, p < 0.001) and phosphorylation
decreased after 24 h (fig. 3a).
next, potential involvement of er␣ in the above described
akt phosphorylation was evaluated. to address this point, mfc7 cells were incubated with cdcl2 (10 ␮m) alone or in the
presence of  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m) for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h.  xxxd2165xxx ,780
fully blocked the cd-induced akt phosphorylation (fig. 3a).

3.4. cadmium stimulates mapks phosphorylation
additionally, different signaling pathways mediate mitogenic signals induced by a hormones, growth factors or heavy
metals (beyersmann and hechtenberg, 1997). many of these
signal transduction pathways involve activation of protein  xxxg1377xxx  of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(erk) family (wilkinson and miller, 2000; eagan et al., 1993).
mapks stimulate the phosphorylation of several intracellular
substrates which trigger mitogenic signals and regulate the entry
of the cells into growth cycle (geffroy et al., 2005). mapks
can phosphorylate and, thus, activate the n-terminal ligandindependent transactivation function of er␣ (kato et al., 2000).
recently, the bidirectional interaction between er␣ and mapk
signal transduction pathway has been established (kato et al.,
2000). also, the interaction of the er␣ with a protein complex, which includes  xxxg530xxx , activates mapk (wong et
al., 2002). to investigate the activation of mapks, mcf-7 cells
were exposed to cdcl2 (10 ␮m) for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h and phosphoerk1/2 levels were evaluated by western blot analyses. as
depicted in fig. 3b, cd induced a strong and sustained activation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in a time-dependent manner, with maximum phosphorylation obtained between 6 and 24 h (1.7-fold, p < 0.01).
again, the activation of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 by cd was an er␣dependent mechanism as demonstrated by the full blockade of
phosphorylation by the addition of  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m) to the
culture medium (fig. 3b).
fig. 3. effects of cd on akt and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. mcf-7 cells
(5 × 105 ) were cultured as described in section 3, and treated with cdcl2
(10 ␮m) alone or in combination with  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m) for the indicated
times. western blot analyses for p-akt (panel a) or p-erk 1/2 (panel b) were
performed. signals were quantified by densitometric analyses and values were
normalized to total akt or erk 1/2 and expressed as percent of basal levels. results are expressed as mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments.
statistical analysis of data by one-way anova with post hoc dunnet test demonstrated a significant increase in p-akt ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 vs. basal and
of * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. basal in p-erk 1/2.

3.5. cadmium stimulates pdgfralpha phosphorylation
several growth factors are claimed to be involved in the
pathogenesis of sex-steroid-dependent carcinoma. among these
factors, platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) and its receptors
seem to play a pivotal role in bc development. in fact, bc cells
produce pdgf and its  xxxg2198xxx  receptors which, through
autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, modulate growth, survival,
and differentiation of bc cells. the a and b isoforms of pdgf

fig. 4. effects of cd on pdgfr␣ phosphorylation. mcf-7 cells (5 × 105 ) were
cultured as described in section 3, and treated with cdcl2 (10 ␮m) alone or in
combination with  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m) for the indicated times. western blot analyses of p-pdgfr␣ were performed. signals were quantified by densitometric
analyses and values were normalized to total pdgfr␣ and expressed as percent of basal levels. results are expressed as mean ± s.d. and are representative
of two independent experiments. ** p < 0.01 vs. basal as evaluated by one-way
anova with post hoc dunnet test.

can form either homodimers or heterodimers which bind to and
activate the protein  xxxg2198xxx  pdgf receptors (pdgfr␣
and pdgfr␤) (claesson-welsh, 1994). since estrogens stimulate pdgf (shanker et al., 1995), we hypothesized that cd
could stimulate this growth factor and its receptor as well. to
test this hypothesis and to determine whether cd could modulate pdgfr␣ activity, mcf-7 cells were treated with cdcl2
(10 ␮m) for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h and levels of phospho-pdgfr␣
were determined by western blot analyses.
total pdgfr␣ levels were not modified over time by cd
exposure (data not shown). on the other hand, cdcl2 significantly increased pdgfr␣ phosphorylation (fig. 4) with maximum effect observed between 3 and 6 h (2-fold, p < 0.01) as
compared to untreated control. to address whether this effect
induced by cd was obtained by an er␣-dependent mechanism,
mcf-7 cells were incubated with cdcl2 alone or in the presence
of  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m). as previously observed with the other
kinases, pdgfr␣ phosphorylation was significantly reduced
to baseline level when cells were incubated with  xxxd2165xxx ,780
(fig. 4).
3.6. cadmium induces the expression of c-jun, c-fos and
pdgf-a
these protein kinases are normally phosphorylated by
either upstream protein kinases or by autophosphorylation in
response to cell signals in a very rapid manner (within minutes),
culminating ultimately in cell growth and proliferation. also e2
activates this kinase within minutes, which strongly suggests
the involvement of non-genomic mediated events. our results
show instead that cd stimulates these kinases with a slower
rate, which brings up the hypothesis of a potentially genomic
mediated mechanism. an important component in the response
to proliferative signals is the rapid, transient transcriptional acti-

vation of early genes, such as c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes.
for instance c-fos expression is regulated at multiple levels by
intracellular signaling events. interestingly, expression of c-fos
and c-jun antisense rna inhibits growth of mcf-7 tumors in
an experimental animal model of athymic mice (dufourny et
al., 1997), suggesting a pivotal role of these proto-oncogenes
in bc development and growth. additionally, e2 stimulates the
above-mentioned proto-oncogenes, which have been described
to bind to ap-1 sites, or to phosphorylate mapks triggering
a series of intracellular events. several proto-oncogenes, such
c-fos, c-jun and c-myc, are activated by low doses (1–100 ␮m)
of cadmium in cell culture in vitro (achanzar et al., 2000; ding
and templeton, 2000). thus, induction of these proto-oncogene
might be mechanistically important for the cadmium-induced
carcinogenicity (chuang et al., 2000).
to determine whether cd could activate kinases phosphorylation by an increase in c-fos and c-jun expression, mcf-7 cells
were treated with cdcl2 (10 ␮m) for 5, 30, 180 min and 24 h and
potential modulation of c-fos and c-jun mrnas was determined
by semiquantitative rt-pcr. as depicted in fig. 5, cd significantly stimulated after 30 min of exposure c-fos (fig. 5a) and
c-jun (fig. 5b) expression (2.25 and 2.45-fold, respectively), as
expected when mitogens stimulate these immediate early genes.
to further investigate the role of er␣ in the cd-induced
activation of c-fos and c-jun, mcf-7 cells were exposed to cd
alone or in the presence of  xxxd2165xxx ,780 (1 ␮m). addition of ici
182,780 to the culture medium resulted in a significant inhibition
of c-fos and c-jun mrna levels (fig. 5a and b). further, since
pdfgr␣ is also phosphorylated in an autocrine manner by the
endogenous ligand pdgfa produced by bc cells, we evaluated
whether cd could increase the endogenous expression of this
growth factor. mcf-7 cells were exposed to cdcl2 (10 ␮m) for
5, 30, 180 min and 24 h and potential modulation of pdgfa
mrna was determined by semiquantitative rt-pcr. as shown
in fig. 5c, cd significantly stimulated in a time-dependent manner pdgfa expression (3.0-fold) with maximum effect reached
after 30 min of exposure and  xxxd2165xxx ,780 partially blunted the
cd-induced stimulation, suggesting that not all of the heavy
metal-induced effects are mediated by ers mechanism.
3.7. inhibition of cadmium-induced mcf-7 cell
proliferation by kinase inhibitors
to determine whether the increased level of phospho-akt,
phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 and phospho-pdgfr␣ were involved in the
mcf-7 cells proliferation induced by cd, cells were seeded at
a density of 1 × 103 cells/well and cultured for 72 h with cdcl2
(10 ␮m) alone or in the presence of kinase inhibitors pd 98059
(5 ␮m), ag18 (1 ␮m) and gleevec (1 ␮m), specific for mapk,
 xxxg2198xxx  and pdgfr␣  xxxg2198xxx  receptors, respectively. at the end of incubation cell proliferation was measured
by brdu incorporation. as previously shown (fig. 1), treatment
of mcf-7 cells with cdcl2 resulted in a significant increase
in cell proliferation. the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors ag18
(1 ␮m), pd 98059 (5 ␮m) and gleevec (1 ␮m) significantly
blunted the cdcl2 -induced mcf-7 proliferation by of 67, 70
and 80%, respectively, strongly suggesting the involvement of

these kinases in the cd-induced proliferation of mcf-7 cells
(fig. 6).
the presence of estrogenically active molecules in our environment and their role in target tissues have been known since
late 1950s, but only in the last decades attention has been drawn
on this class of compounds to which belong xenoestrogens, environmental hormones, hormonally active agents and endocrine
chemicals (mclachlan, 2001a,b; migliaccio and anderson,
2003). in the last years an increasing number of compounds has
been added to this list, including cd for which a potential role as
endocrine disrupter and carcinogenic factor. indeed this heavy

fig. 6. kinase inhibitors block the cd-induced mcf-7 cell proliferation. mcf7
cells were seeded in 96-multiwell plates at a density of 1 × 103 per well and as
described in section 3, and treated with cdcl2 (10 ␮m) alone or in the presence
of kinase inhibitors pd 98059 (5 ␮m), ag18 (1 ␮m) and gleevec (1 ␮m). cells
were cultured for 72 h and cell proliferation was determined by brdu incorporation. the results are expressed as described in fig. 1. data are expressed as
mean ± s.d and are representative of two independent experiments performed
in triplicate. ** p < 0.01 vs. control as determined by student’s unpaired t-test.

metal is largely present in our environment and considered an
important harmful environmental pollutant involved in the genesis of many tumors in particular of renal tumors (mclaughlin
et al., 1995; cerulli et al., 2006). interestingly, the presence of
this heavy metal in cigarettes (1–7 ␮g of cadmium/cigarette) and
in environmental air pollution is well documented, suggesting
also a role of this heavy metal in the increase incidence of several human cancers. the ability of this pollutant of binding the
ers has also induced to draw the hypothesis of a role in the
carcinogenesis of estrogen target tissues as breast.
our results demonstrate that cadmium increases bc cell proliferation in vitro by, at least in part, mimicking the biological
action of e2 . in particular, the data show for the first time that
this heavy metal activates akt,  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pdgfr␣ kinases
activity by an er␣-dependent mechanism, due to its ability of
binding er␣, suggesting a correlation of cadmium with breast
cancer.
finally, our results suggest that cd as other estrogenic environmental molecules, are able to disrupt the normal cell homeostasis triggering signals otherwise switched off. in particular, the increased cell proliferation induced by cadmium in a
receptor-mediated but hormone-independent manner could in
part play a role in the bc cell progression. however, further
studies are needed to fully clarify the role of this estrogenic
active pollutant in bc cell carcinogenesis to prove or disprove
a role of cd in tumorogenesis.
