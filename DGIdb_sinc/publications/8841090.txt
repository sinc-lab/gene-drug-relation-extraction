abstract: certain types of neuronal ion channels have been demonstrated to be the major target sites of insecticides. the
insecticide-channel interactions that have been studied most extensively are pyrethroid actions on the voltage-gated sodium
channel and cyclodiene/lindane actions on the gabaa receptor chloride channel complex. with the exception of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides which inhibit acetylcholinesterases, most insecticides commercially developed act
on the sodium channel and the gaba system. pyrethroids slow the kinetics of both activation and inactivation gates of
sodium channels resulting in prolonged openings of individual channels. this causes membrane depolarization, repetitive
discharges and synaptic disturbances leading to hyperexcitatory symptoms of poisoning in animals. only a very small
fraction (- 1%) of sodium channel population is required to be modified by pyrethroids to produce severe hyperexcitatory
symptoms. this toxicity amplification theory applies to pharmacological and toxicological actions of other drugs that go
through a threshold phenomenon. selective toxicity of pyrethroids between invertebrates and mammals can be explained
based largely on the responses of sodium channels and partly on metabolic degradation. the pyrethroid-sodium channel
interaction is also supported by na+ uptake and batrachotoxin binding experiments. cyclodienes and lindane exert a
 xxxd2082xxx  on the gabaa system, the initial transient stimulation being followed by a suppression. the stimulation
requires the presence of the y2 subunit. the suppression of the gaba system is also documented by ci- flux and ligand
binding experiments. it appears that the sodium channel and the gaba system merit continuing efforts for development
of newer and better insecticides. nitromethylene heterocycles including imidacloprid act on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. insect receptors are more sensitive to these compounds than mammalian receptors. single-channel analyses of the
 xxxg456xxx  of pc12 cells have shown that imidacloprid increases the activity of subconductance state
currents and decreases that of main conductance state currents. this may explain the imidacloprid suppression of acetylcholine responses.

whereas the metabolism of insecticides has been studied
extensively since the development of many synthetic insecticides after world war 11, it was not until the mid-1960s that
the cellular mechanism of action of certain insecticides on
the nervous system was elucidated (narahashi 1971). with
the exception of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides which inhibit cholinesterases, most other neuroactive
insecticides act directly on neural receptors and/or ion
channels thereby causing symptoms of poisoning. emphasis
is placed on recent development in the study of insecticidechannel interactions, but historical background is briefly
given in some cases to facilitate our understanding of how
we have come to the present status of knowledge.
the types of ion channels that have been demonstrated
to be the major target of insecticides are quite limited. only
the sodium channels and the gabaa receptor-chloride
channel complex are known to be affected by neuroactive
insecticides with only a few exceptions including some that
act on the acetylcholine receptor-channel complex. therefore, this minireview deals mostly with these three types of
channels.

sodium channel modulation by pyrethroids.
general. it is well established that pyrethroids exert potent
actions on neuronal sodium channels thereby causing symptoms of poisoning in animals (narahashi 1971, 1976, 1985,
1988a, 1989 & 1992; narahashi et al. 1995; ruigt 1984; soderlund & bloomquist 1989; vijverberg & van den bercken
1990). pyrethroids may be divided into two groups: type i
pyrethroids do not have a cyano group in the a position,
and their symptoms of poisoning are characterized by hyperexcitation, ataxia, convulsions and paralysis; type i1 pyrethroids have an ct cyano group and cause hypersensitivity,
choreoathetosis, tremors and paralysis. however, the primary target for both types of pyrethroids is the sodium
channel. the pyrethroids slow the kinetics of both opening
and closing of individual sodium channels resulting in delayed and prolonged openings. this causes prolongation of
the whole-cell sodium current during a depolarizing pulse
and marked slowing of the tail sodium current upon repolarization. pyrethroids also cause a shift of the activation
voltage in the direction of hyperpolarization. these changes
in sodium channel kinetics lead to a membrane depolarization and an increase in depolarizing after-potential. the latter reaches the threshold for excitation causing repetitive

after-discharges. the membrane depolarization of sensory
neurons increases discharge frequency, and that of nerve
terminals increases the release of transmitter and the frequency of spontaneous miniature postsynaptic potentials.
all of these changes can account for the various symptoms
of poisoning including hyperexcitation, hypersensitivity,
convulsions and tremors. ddt resembles type i pyrethroids
in its action on sodium channels. experiments by measuring
22na+uptake and batrachotoxin binding provide additional
support to the sodium channel target theory (bloomquist &
soderlund 1988; brown et al. 1988; ghiasuddin & soderlund 1985; lombet et al. 1988).
sodium channel gating kinetics. voltage clamp experiments
using squid and crayfish giant axons and frog nodes of
ranvier have revealed drastic changes in sodium channel
currents caused by pyrethroids. an example of such an experiment is shown in fig. 1. the sodium current during depolarization is prolonged, and tail current associated with
step repolarization is greatly augmented and prolonged.
the exact pattern of changes differs depending on the type
of pyrethroids and the kind of nerve preparation, yet the
basic scheme of change is the same. such a prolonged sodium current causes the depolarizing after-potential to be
increased and prolonged which reaches the threshold membrane potential for generation of repetitive discharges
(lund & narahashi 1981a & b; vijverberg et al. 1982).
the dependence of channel activation and inactivation
on membrane potential also undergoes drastic changes by
pyrethroids. the activation-voltage and the steady-state inactivation-voltage relationships are shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction (wang et al. 1972; tatebayashi & narahashi 1994; salgado et al. 1989). the shift of the activation
curve, together with the prolonged opening of single sodium
channels, results in membrane depolarization (salgado et
al. 1989) which causes disturbances of synaptic transmission and initiation of massive discharges from sensory
neurons forming the basis for paresthesia.

mv from a holding potential of -100 mv in k-free external and
internal perfusates. in the control (a), the peak transient sodium
current is followed by a small slow current during a depolarizing
step, and the tail sodium current upon step repolarization decays
quickly. after application of allethrin (b), the peak transient sodium current remains unchanged, but the slow current and tail current are increased in amplitude and the latter decays very slowly.

patch clamp experiments have clearly demonstrated sizeable prolongations of open time of single sodium channels
(yamamoto et al. 1983; chinn & narahashi 1986; holloway
et al. 1989).contrary to normal sodium channels which open
briefly only at the beginning of depolarizing step due to inactivation, pyrethroid-modified channels open with a long delay and with a prolonged life time, the duration of which is
sometimes as long as several seconds as against the normal
open time of several milliseconds (fig. 2). the modified channels often remain open after termination of depolarizing
pulse. these observations indicate that the kinetics of both
activation and inactivation are slowed by pyrethroids and the
gates tend to be stuck at the open or closed position (chinn &
narahashi 1986; vijverberg et al. 1982). a corollary of these
results is an inhibition of gating currents which has actually
been observed (salgado & narahashi 1993).
state dependency of channel modification. since the sodium
channel can be in the resting closed state, open state, or
inactivated state, a question is raised as to which state has
a high affinity for pyrethroids (fig. 3). the state dependency
is an important parameter to understand the mechanism
of action of any chemical on ion channels. if pyrethroid
modification occurs exclusively in the closed state of the
sodium channel, the rate at which the modified open channel develops during depolarization is expected to be independent of the pyrethroid concentration. experiments with
squid giant axons have demonstrated that this is largely, if
not completely, the case indicating that pyrethroids have a
high affinity for the closed state although there is a small
component of open channel modification (de weille et al.
1988; brown & narahashi 1992). single-channel recording
experiments with mouse neuroblastoma (nie-i 15) cells
treated with fenvalerate also provided support to the closed
channel modification. the probability of channel modification by pyrethroids is independent of the dwell time of
the channel in the open state (hollowdy et al. 1989).
however, it is also evident that channel opening increases
the affinity for pyrethroids. this has been demonstrated by
repetitive stimulation experiments with crayfish giant axons
exposed to fenvalerate. although the response to the first
depolarizing pulse showed a peak current followed by a prolonged steady-state and tail currents which are characteristics for pyrethroid-treated preparations, repetitive depolarizing stimuli gradually decreased the peak current with a
concomitant increase in steady-state and tail currents indicating use-dependent open channel modification (salgado & narahashi 1993). thus, it is concluded that pyrethroids modify the sodium channel at its resting closed state
and that opening increases the affinity for pyrethroids.
open channelproperties. a permeant cation does not simply
go through an open channel according to its electrochemical
gradient. there are barriers and binding sites in the channel
through which a permeant cation must pass. thus, any cation capable of penetrating the open channel could cause
block when it binds to an intrachannel binding site. the per-

meability of cations differs depending on the height of intrachannel barriers. open sodium channels are known to be permeable to and blocked by, to a varying extent, certain monovalent and divalent cations such as sodium, lithium,
ammonium, guanidine, formamidine, calcium and magnesium (yamamoto et al. 1984, 1985 & 1986): the block is
voltage dependent, being augmented by hyperpolarization.
this can be seen in the instantaneous current-voltage curves
which are not linear but bend upward decreasing the current
amplitude at large negative potentials (fig. 4a).

ships for the cations tested indicating that it does not interfere with cation permeation and block through binding to
an intrachannel site (fig. 4b). this is shown by calculating
the cation permeability ratios of open sodium channels
from the shifts of the reversal potential using the constant
field equation. the permeability ratios for na:li:ammonium:guanidine:formamidine are 1:1.19:0.21:0.28:0.20 for
control and 1:1.18:0.29:0.29:0.25 after exposure to 50 pm
tetramethrin (yamamoto et al. 1986). since the permeability of sodium channels to various cations is controlled by the selectivity filter located near the external orifice of the channel (hille 1971), it is concluded that tetramethrin does not alter its property (yamamoto et al. 1986).
site of action of pyrethroids in the sodium channel. the
aforementioned study indicates that pyrethroids do not
bind to an intrachannel site. there are chemical agents for
which the site of action in the sodium channel has been
identified. therefore, these agents were used to determine
their interactions with pyrethroids. n-octylguanidine blocks
the sodium channel by entering from inside the membrane
when the gates are open (kirsch et al. 1980) in a manner
similar to that of local anaesthetics (strichartz 1973;

1981; narahashi & seyama 1974; khodorov 1985; khodorov et ul. 1976; tanguy & yeh 1991). the batrachotoxin
molecule appears to bind to an intrachannel site to which
the inactivation gate normally binds causing inactivation
(tanguy et al. 1984). tetramethrin modification of the sodium channel is not influenced by grayanotoxin (takeda &
narahashi 1988) or batrachotoxin (tanguy & narahashi,
unpublished observation), indicating that tetramethrin acts
on a site different from the batrachotoxin/grayanotoxin
binding site.
tetrodotoxin (ttx) selectively blocks the sodium channel through binding to a site at its external orifice (narahashi 1988b). it blocks the tetramethrin-modified sodium
channel in a non-competitive manner (fig. 3,indicating that
tetramethrin does not bind to the ttx site (lund & narahashi 1982). it appears that pyrethroids are dissolved in the
lipid phase of the nerve membrane and get access to the
channel gating machinery.
d$ferentid sensitivity of tetrodotoxin-sensitive and tetvodotoxin-resistant sodium channels to pyrethroids. in order to
elucidate the mechanism of pyrethroid intoxication, it is of
crucial importance to use mammalian neurons as material.
dorsal root genglion cells of the rat are endowed with two
types of sodium channels, one sensitive to ttx and the
other largely insensitive to ttx (kostyuk et al. 1981; elliott & elliott 1993; ogata & tatebayashi 1993; roy & narahashi 1992). the difference in the k, values for ttx block
is as much as lo5 times. these two types of sodium channels
also exhibit different sensitivities to other chemicals including lidocaine and chlorpromazine (roy & narahashi 1992).
previous electrophysiology on pyrethroids was performed
mainly with invertebrate axon and amphibian nerve preparations; existing mammalian data were from nie-i 15
mouse neuroblastoma cells. unlike rat dorsal root ganglion
cells, differentiated n ie- 1 15 neuroblastoma cells express

9-aminoacridine (yeh 1979), and strychnine (shapiro 1977).
octylguanidine block of the sodium channel is not affected
by phenothrin (de weille et al. 1988). therefore, pyrethroids
appear to bind to a site different form the intrachannel
binding site of octylguanidine and presumably of local anesthetics.
batrachotoxin and grayanotoxin slow the kinetics of the
activation and inactivation gates and shift their voltage dependence to hyperpolarization resulting in slow sodium currents and membrane depolarization (albuquerque et d.

only a tetrodotoxin-sensitive current; further, this ttx-sensitive current differs from the ttx-sensitive current of rat
dorsal root ganglion cells. tetramethrin and allethrin modify both ttx-sensitive and ttx-resistant sodium channels,
but in somewhat different manners (ginsburg & narahashi
1993; tatebayashi & narahashi 1994). in ttx-sensitive sodium channels, the slow sodium current during step depolarization is increased somewhat by the pyrethroids, and a
tail sodium current with a slowly rising and falling phase
appears upon repolarization (fig. 6a). in ttx-resistant sodium channels, the slow sodium current during step depolarization is markedly increased by tetramethrin, and upon
repolarization a large instantaneous tail current is generated
and decayed slowly (fig. 6b). in ttx-sensitive channels exposed to tetramethrin, the tail current develops even after
the sodium current during depolarization has subsided.
however, in the tetramethrin-modified ttx-resistant channels, the sodium current during depolarization and the tail
current upon repolarization develop and decrease in parallel
with each other. the steady-state sodium channel inactivation curve is shifted by tetramethrin in the hyperpolarizing direction in both ttx-sensitive and ttx-resistant
channels. the sodium conductance-voltage curve is also
shifted by tetramethrin in the hyperpolarizing direction in
both ttx-sensitive and ttx-resistant channels, and the
latter is affected more strongly than the former.
the slowly rising and slowly decaying tail current observed in ttx-sensitive sodium channels after exposure to
the pyrethroids is similar to that observed in frog nodes of
ranvier in the presence of pyrethroids (vijverberg et al.

1982). since the sodium current during step depolarization
is only slightly prolonged by tetramethrin, the sodium inactivation is not markedly inhibited. however, the activation
gate is stuck at the open position during depolarizing pulse
and can close very slowly upon repolarization (chinn &
narahashi 1986). thus, upon termination of depolarization, the inactivation gate returns to its open position producing a slow rise of tail current. the activation gate starts,
closing very slowly resulting in a hooked tail current as
shown in fig. 6a (tatebayashi & narahashi 1994). cerebellar purkinje neurones of the rat are endowed with ttxsensitive sodium channels which respond to tetramethrin in
a similar manner to dorsal root ganglia ttx-sensitive sodium channels (song & narahashi 1996).
percentages of sodium channel modijication by pyrethroids.
a method has been developed by which the percentage of
sodium channels modified by pyrethroids can be measured
(tatebayashi & narahashi 1994). the slow tail current associated with step replorization is indicative of the activity
of the pyrethroid-modified sodium channels, whereas the
peak current during step depolarization is a result of the
activity of the normal unmodified sodium channels. thus
the sodium conductance upon repolarization can be divided
by the peak conductance during step depolarization to calculate the percentage of the modified sodium channels (tatebayashi & narahashi 1994).
the concentrations of tetramethrin required to modify
1.3% of sodium channels are 10 nm for ttx-resistant
channels and 300 nm for ttx-sensitive channels (table 1).
to modify 12-15% of channels, 100 nm tetramethrin was
required for ttx-resistant channels, whereas as much as
10 pm tetramethrin is required for ttx-sensitive channels.
therefore, the difference in tetramethrin sensitivity between
ttx-resistant and ttx-sensitive sodium channels is as
much as 30-100 times. invertebrate nerve sodium channels,
which are sensitive to ttx, are almost equally sensitive to
pyrethroids as dorsal root ganglion ttx-resistant channels.
pyrethroid toxicity amplijication in rat cerebellar purkinje
neurones. whereas the data with rat dorsal root ganglia
neurones are highly informative, a question is raised as to
how the sodium channels in the brain, which are deemed
the major target of pyrethroids, behave in response to pyrethroids. cerebellar purkinje neurones of the rat are endowed with ttx-sensitive sodium channels, which are only
moderately sensitive to tetramethrin as ttx-sensitive sodium channels of dorsal root ganglion neurones (song &
narahashi 1996). the percentages of the sodium channels
modified by tetramethrin at room temperature ranged from
0.6% at 0.1 pm tetramethrin to 25% at 30 pm (table 1). in
order to compare these data on channel modification with
repetitive discharges caused by an increase in depolarizing
after-potential, current clamp experiments were performed
with cerebellar purkinje neurones. the threshold concentration of tetramethrin to induce repetitive after-discharges
is 0.1 pm at room temperature. therefore, modification of

0.6% of the sodium channels is enough to cause repetitive
after-discharges leading to hyperexcitatory symptoms of
poisoning in animals.
this "toxicity amplification" theory, which was originally
proposed with squid giant axons on the basis of several
assumptions (lund & narahashi 1982), is now firmly established in mammalian neurones on the basis of solid experimental data. this concept has important implications to
evaluate effective concentrations of toxicants or therapeutic
drugs that act via a threshold phenomenon. take an example in which a slow membrane depolarization caused by
channel openings reaches the threshold and induces repetitive discharges. discharges may be stopped once the slow
depolarization is brought down by a drug just below the
threshold for excitation. the concentration of the drug for
this action will be much less than the ecso. the situation
may likely be applied to the action of antiepileptic drugs in
stopping epileptic discharges. thus, as far as drugs that act
through a threshold phenomenon are concerned, we need to
reconsider the traditional pharmacological concept which
dictates the comparison of the in vitro ecs0 value with the
drug concentration in the patient serum.
temperature dependence of pyrethroid action. temperature
has a profound effect on the insecticidal activity of pyrethroids and ddt (narahashi 1971 & 1976; ruigt 1984).
the activity increases with lowering the temperature. the
mechanism lies mainly in the temperature-dependent sensitivity of the nerve to these insecticides (narahashi 1971,
1989 & 1992). this phenomenon is very important not only
because it provides us with a clue to the mechanism of insecticide interactions with channels, but also because it constitutes the basis for the selective toxicity between mammals
and insects (song & narahashi 1996).
the potency of ddt to induce repetitive discharges from
cockroach sensory neurones increases with lowering the
temperature with a qlo of 0.2 (yamasaki & ishii (narahashi) 1954a). the ability of allethrin to induce repetitive
after-discharges in cockroach and squid axons increases
with lowering the temperature within a limit (narahashi
1962; starkus & narahashi 1978). pyrethroid-induced de-

polarization also exhibits negative temperature dependence
(salgado el al. 1989). the negative temperature dependence
of pyrethroid action on nerves was also shown with housefly
ganglia (ahn et al. 1987) and cockroach nerve (gammon
1978). the slow decay of the sodium tail current in the presence of pyrethroids is further slowed by lowering the temperature in frog nodes of ranvier (vijverberg et al. 1983).
binding of ddt to housefly brain increases with lowering
the temperature (chang & plapp 1983).
both current clamp and voltage clamp experiments were
performed recently with rat cerebellar purkinje neurones
(song & narahashi 1996). tetramethrin at 100 nm and 300
nm, which modifies 0.62% and 2.19% of sodium channels,
respectively (table l), induces repetitive after-discharges at
low temperatures (15-20") but repetitive responsiveness subsides at higher temperatures (30-35").
voltage clamp experiments have disclosed profound influence of temperature on tetramethrin-induced slow tail
currents (song & narahashi 1996). while the peak amplitude of tail current is not drastically changed by temperature change, both the rising and falling phases of slow tail
current are greatly slowed by lowering the temperature. the
temperature-dependent effect of tetramethrin is analyzed
with respect to three different parameters. the qlo values
for the percentage of the sodium channels modified by 3
pm tetramethrin are about the same in two temperature
ranges, 0.79 for 25"-35". the time constant for the decay of
slow tail current has a large negative temperature coefficient, the qlo showing 0.11 for 25"-35". as expected from
the qlo values for the time constant of tail current decay,
the charge movement during tail current also shows a large
negative temperature coefficient, with the q l o value of 0.18
for 25"-35". thus, the increased and prolonged flow of sodium ions through tetramethrin-modified sodium channels
at low temperatures augments the depolarizing after-potential which in turn reaches the threshold for repetitive afterdischarges.

larization under voltage clamp conditions. thus, the ideal
antidote for pyrethroid intoxication should selectively block
the changes caused by pyrethroids without affecting normal
sodium currents. local anaesthetics such as lidocaine,
qx3 14 and tetracaine have been reported as potential antidotes for pyrethroids, which preferentially block deltamethrin (a type i1 pyrethroid)-induced tail currents (oortgiesen et al. 1990). however, local anaesthetics do block the
normal sodium current and cannot be regarded as selective
antidotes for pyrethroids.
one annoying symptom often noted by humans exposed
to pyrethroids, usually in an occupational setting, is abnormal skin sensation or paresthesia, which is due to repetitive
firing of sensory nerve ending (vijverberg &van den bercken
1990). the paresthesia includes tingling, itching and burning
sensation of the skin, without the clinical symptoms of erythema, oedema, or vesiculation (knox et al. 1984; lequesne
et al. 1980).  xxxd3521xxx  oil was found to be an effective
prophylactic and therapeutic agent for cutaneous exposure to
pyrethroids (tucker et al. 1984; flannigan & tucker 1985).
explanations were sought for the mechanism of inhibitory
action of  xxxd3521xxx  oil in its antioxidant and biomembrane
stabilizing effect. furthermore, oortgiesen et al. (1990) reported that  xxxd3521xxx  had no effect on deltamethrin-modified sodium current in neuroblastoma cells. however, we have
found that  xxxd3521xxx  selectively blocks the tetramethrin (a

10 pm tetramethrin-modified ttx-sensitive sodium channels in rat cerebellar purkinje cells by 3 1% and 77%, respectively, and in rat dorsal root ganglia cells by 34% and 76%,
respectively. the concentration-response curves for tetramethrin modification of the sodium channels are shifted in
the direction of higher concentrations by (5)- xxxd3521xxx  in
a competitive manner. elevated depolarizing after-potential
or repetitive after-discharges caused by tetramethrin in both
cerebellar purkinje cells and dorsal root ganglia cells are effectively blocked by (?)- xxxd3521xxx . it is unlikely that antioxidant or free radical removing action of (+)- xxxd3521xxx 
plays a role in reducing pyrethroid toxicity, because there is
no evidence that pyrethroid acts as an oxidant or free radical.
selective toxicity of pyrethroids. the mechanisms underlying high insecticidal activity and low mammalian toxicity of
pyrethroids have been a matter of controversy for many
years. it was generally accepted, albeit without solid experimental data, that higher rates of enzymatic degradation of
pyrethroids in mammals than in insects were responsible for
different degrees of toxicity. we have at long last come up
with a conclusion on the basis of experimental data, some
of which are described in preceding sections. the results
with mammalian brain neurones were compared with those
with various invertebrate neurones obtained previously. the
difference in each contributing factor between rat purkinje
neurones and invertebrate axons was estimated (table 2)

7

(song & narahashi 1996). the estimation indicates that interspecies differences in the potency and efficacy of tetramethrin on sodium channels play the major role in the
selective toxicity. detoxication of tetramethrin also plays a
minor role. these factors contribute to approximately
2,000-fold difference in toxicity which is in the same order
of magnitude as the differences in measured ld5o values of
50&4,500-fold for tetramethrin (elliott 1977; hirai 1987;
miyamoto 1993; wiswesser 1976).
pyrethroid modulation of gaba receptor-channel complex.
type i1 pyrethroids have been shown to block the gabaa
receptor-channel complex (abalis et al. 1986; bloomquist
et al. 1986; crofton et al. 1987; eshleman & murray 1990;
gammon & sander 1985; lawrence & casida 1983; lawrence et al. 1985; lummis et al. 1987; ramadan et al. 1988a).
the gaba hypothesis has been a matter of extensive debate, partly because the potency and efficacy of the action
are low. our initial patch clamp experiments with rat dorsal
root ganglion neurones have unequivocally shown that
while 10 pm deltamethrin greatly prolongs the sodium current as expected, the gaba-induced chloride current recorded from the very same cell remains totally unchanged
(ogata et al. 1988). however, our preliminary patch clamp
experiments with rat hippocampal neurones have indicated
that there is a transient increase in gaba-induced chloride
current following application of pyrethroids (frey et al.
1989). thus more careful and extensive studies along this
line are warranted.
the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors have been
claimed to be a target for both type i and type i1 pyrethroids (devaud & murray 1988). a significant correlation was
found between the proconvulsant effects of the pyrethroids
and their respective ic50 values as inhibitors of [3h]ro54864 binding. however, other investigators claimed that the
correlation between the potencies to inhibit [3h]ro5-4864
binding and their toxicities was poor (ramadan et al.
1988b).
effects of pyrethroids on calcium channels.
there has been some speculation as to whether calcium
channels, which are known to play a variety of important
roles in nerve and muscle function, are the target site of
pyrethroids. permethrin at a concentration as low as 50 pm
increased the electrical activity of neurosecretory cells of the
stick insect (orchard & osborne 1979), which generate action potentials by inward calcium currents (osborne 1980).
thus it was proposed that pyrethroids act on calcium channels to exert their toxic effects (osborne 1980; gammon &
sander 1985). however, our patch clamp experiments with
neuroblastoma cells have failed to demonstrate this action.
rather, pyrethroids were found to suppress both type i (t
type) and type i1 (l type) calcium channel currents (yoshii
et al. 1985). this blocking action may be related to some
phases of symptoms of poisoning. the observed impulse
discharges from the insect neurosecretory cells may be derived from repetitive discharges of presynaptic neurones and

their nerve terminals through prolonged opening of sodium
channels.
effects of pyrethroids on voltage-gated chloride channels.
voltage-gated chloride channels of neuroblastoma (n 1el 15) cells with a large single channel conductance at 343 ps
have recently been found to be suppressed by 2 pm deltamethrin (forshaw et ul. 1993). the suppression was due to
a decrease in open channel probability. the toxicological
significance of this action remains to be seen.
eflects of pyrethroids on acetylcholine receptor-channel complex.
the acetylcholine receptor-channel complex has been
claimed to be a target site of pyrethroids. the binding of
[3h]perhydrohistrionicotoxinto the torpedo electric organ
was inhibited to various extents by type i and type i1 pyrethroids (abbassy et ul. 1982, 1983a & b; eldefrawi et al.
1984; sherby et al. 1986). these binding data are at variance
with the electrophysiological data on frog skeletal muscle
end-plates (wouters et al. 1977). the amplitude of the endplate potential was not affected by 10 pm allethrin, although repetitive end-plate potentials were evoked by a
single nerve stimulus as a result of repetitive discharges at
the nerve terminals. one possible explanation for the
controversy is that binding does not necessarily lead to response. this problem remains to be solved. more important
experiments would be to study the effects of pyrethroids on
neuronal nicotinic and muscarinic ach receptor-channels.
in fact, there is some evidence to indicate pyrethroid interactions with muscarinic ach receptors (erikson & nordberg 1990; erikson & fredrikson 1991). in helix neurones,
deltamethrin depressed the ach-induced current (kiss &
osipenko 1991). it should also be noted that active and
inactive isomers of pyrethroids were found to exert nonspecific, inhibitory effects on the nicotinic ach receptors of
nie-i 15 neuroblastoma cells (oortgieson et al. 1989).
effects of pyrethroids on excitatory amino acid receptorchannel.
the excitatory amino acid receptor-channel system has
been shown to be affected by pyrethroids. the binding of
[3h]kainate to mouse brain homogenates was inhibited by

pyrethroids with iczs values ranging from 80 nm for deltamethrin to 8 pm for cis-permethrin (staatz et al. 1982). the
glutamate sensitivity of the muscle of housefly larvae was
suppressed by 1 pm cypermethrin (seabrook et al. 1988).
biocheniical effects of pyrethroids.
na-ca atp hydrolysis and ca+ mg atp hydrolysis have
been shown to be inhibited by pyrethroids (clark & matsumura 1987). depolarization-induced protein phosphorylation is stimulated by deltamethrin, and the release of ca2+
from the intracellular storage sites is implicated (enan &
matsumura 1991; matsumura et ni. 1989). both type i and
type i1 pyrethroids stimulate phosphoinositide breakdown
in synaptoneurosomes (gusovsky e f al. 1986). type i1 pyrethroids including cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenvalerate were found to be potent inhibitors of the neural calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, with ics0 values ranging from 0.01-1 nm (enan &
matsumura 1992). however, insecticidally inactive chiral
isomers of these pyrethroids, active type i pyrethroids, ddt
and heptachlor epoxide were much weaker inhibitors. these
observations suggest involvement of the protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation system in intoxication
caused by type i1 pyrethroids.

lindane and cyclodienes
suppression of g a baa receptor-chloride channel complex.
whereas the action of lindane and cyclodienes to stimulate
synaptic transmission was demonstrated almost 40 years
ago (yamasaki & ishii (narahashi) 1954b; yamasaki & narahashi 1958), it was not until the early 1980s that the
gaba receptor-channel complex was suggested to be their
target site. lindane and cyclodienes were shown to antagonize the action of gaba in stimulating 36cl- uptake by various nerve and muscle preparations (abalis et al. 1986;
bloomquist & soderlund 1985; bloomquist et al. 1986; ghiasuddin & matsumura 1982). these insecticides also inhibited the binding of [35s]tbps(bermudez et al. 1991; cole &
casida 1986; llorens et al. 1990; lummis et al. 1990; matsumura & ghiasuddin 1983; matsumoto et al. 1988; olsen
et al. 1989; thompson et al. 1990), and their inhibitory effects on 36ci- uptake and [35s]tbps binding run parallel

with each other, indicating they act at the tbps binding
site (pomcs et al. 1994).
the first patch clamp experiments for these insecticides
have clearly demonstrated that the gaba-induced chloride
current is suppressed by lindane (ogata et al. 1988). noise
analyses conducted recently by bermudez et al. (1991) with
cockroach neurones have shown that lindane and dieldrin
decrease the frequency of gaba-chloride channel openings
without changing the mean open time. whereas dieldrin
had no effect on the single-channel conductance, lindane
decreased it. the latter effect of lindane is not shared by
zufall et al. (1989) who found no effect in crayfish stomach
muscle. thus there still remains an important controversy
regarding the effect of lindane on single channels. poly
(a)+rna from rat cerebral cortex expressed gaba-induced currents (ig.actx)in xenopus oocytes, and rna from
bovine retina expressed two types of gaba-induced currents, i.e. i g - aand
~ ~ig-br,the latter of which was atypical
in that it was resistant to bicuculline (woodward et al.
1992). y- xxxd2488xxx  (y- xxxd2488xxx  or lindane) potently inhibited all three types of gaba-induced currents,
whereas a-,6- and p- xxxd2488xxx  exhibited differential effects:
these three isomers potentiated ig-actx and ig-aret, but had
little or no effect on ig-br. lindane inhibited gaba-induced currents in frog dorsal root ganglia neurones also
(tokutomi et al. 1994).
 xxxd2082xxx  of dieldrin on g a b a a receptor-channel complex.

when co-applied.with gaba, dieldrin exerted a dual effect
on the gaba-induced chloride current of rat dorsal root
ganglia neurone (fig. 7) (nagata & narahashi 1994). the
chloride current induced by 10 pm gaba was greatly enhanced by the first 20-sec. co-application with 1 pm dieldrin, but the enhancement subsided during repeated co-applications, and the current was eventually suppressed below
the control level. no recovery occurred after a prolonged
washing with dieldrin-free solution. desensitization of the
chloride current was accelerated by dieldrin. dieldrin
exerted its inhibitory effect on the gaba-induced current
regardless of the presence or absence of pentobarbital and
chlordiazepoxide. however, its effect was attenuated by the
presence of  xxxd2947xxx . furthermore, dieldrin suppressed
the gaba-induced chloride current in a non-competitive
manner. these results indicate that dieldrin binds to the
 xxxd2947xxx  site which is closely associated with the chloride
channel. the suppressive action of dieldrin on the gabainduced chloride current is deemed directly responsible for
excitatory symptoms of poisoning in animals, but the role
of the enhancing action is not clear.
selective actions of dieldrin on g a b a a receptor-channel subunits.

the gabaa receptor-chloride channel complex is believed
to be a pentameric protein comprising five subunits in various combinations (nayeem et al. 1994). at present six a,
four p, three y, one 6 and two q subunits are known to
exist. different subunits have been shown to differ consider-

ably in their sensitivity to the actions of various drugs. we
studied the differential effects of dieldrin on the gabainduced chloride current of human embryonic kidney cells
expressing three different combinations of a, p and y subunits (nagata et al. 1994). the ecs0values for gaba induction of current were estimated to be 9.8 pm for the
alp2y2s combination, 2.0 pm for the a l p 2 combination
and 3.0 pm for the a6p2y2s combination. when co-applied
with gaba, dieldrin exerted a dual effect, enhancement
and suppression, on the gaba-induced chloride currents
in the alp2y2s and a6p2y2s combinations (fig. 8a and b).
however, only suppression was observed in the a1 p2 combination, indicating that the y subunit is necessary for dieldrin's enhancing effect (fig. 8c). dieldrin was more efficacious in enhancing the current in the a6p2y2s combination than in the a1 p2y2s combination, indicating some
specific role of a subunits in the dieldrin enhancement of
current. dieldrin suppressed the gaba-induced current in
a non-competitive manner, with an ecsovalue of 2.1 pm
for al p2y2s, 2.8 pm for a1 p2 and 1.0 pm for a6p2y2s combination. these results indicated that unlike the enhancing
effect of dieldrin, the suppressive effect showed no selec-

tivity for the specific gaba receptor subunit combinations
tested.
difffrential effects of  xxxd2488xxx  isomers on gabaa receptorchannel complex.
 xxxd2488xxx  comprises geometric isomers and
their insecticidal effects are highly dependent on its steric
configuration. the y-isomer is most toxic to mammals and
insects and is a strong stimulant. the a-isomer is a weak
stimulant, the j3-isomer is a weak depressant, and the 6isomer is a strong depressant. recently, pomes et al. (1994)
have demonstrated differential effects of  xxxd2488xxx -isomers on gaba-induced 36cl-uptake by cortical neurones in primary culture.
our patch clamp experiments for the effects of four isomers, a-,p-, y- and 6- xxxd2488xxx  on rat dorsal
root ganglia neurones have unveiled several important aspects of the action of  xxxd2488xxx  isomers on
the gabaa receptor-chloride channel complex (nagata &
narahashi 1995). when co-applied with 10 pm gaba, 1
pm y- xxxd2488xxx  slightly enhanced and then
suppressed the gaba-induced chloride current. the desensitization of the current was greatly accelerated by yhexachlorocyclohexane in a dose-dependent manner. the
acceleration of desensitization and the suppression of sus-

nitromethylene heterocycles are a novel and distinct class
of insecticides (moffat 1993). they exhibit selective toxicity
towards insects, with relatively low toxicity in mammals and
fish (soloway et al. 1978). imidacloprid, 1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-n-aitroimidazolidin-2-ylideneamine,
and a related nitromethylene, 1-(3-pyridylmethyl)-2-nitromethyleneimidazolidine (pmni), cause slow depolarizations in the
cockroach motor neurone and displace specific ['251]a-bungarotoxin binding to cockroach nerve cord preparations
(bai et al. 1991). imidacloprid binds to the insect nicotinic
ach receptor with a higher affinity than the mammalian
receptor accounting for a selective toxicity (liu & casida
1993; liu et al. 1994; tomizawa et al. 1995). several nitromethylene heterocylce compounds including imidacloprid
induced responses similar to ach-induced responses, and
the effect is blocked by nicotinic ach receptor antagonists
(benson 1992; cheung et al. 1992; harris et ul. 1986; leech
et al. 1991; sattelle et al. 1989; zwart et al. 1992). these
compounds induce transient inward currents in locust neurones resembling ach-induced currents, and block ach-induced currents (zwart et al. 1994). mammalian endplate
ach receptors and neuronal nicotinic ach receptors (n1 e115 line) were much less sensitive to these compounds than
the ach receptor of locust neurones.
our recent patch clamp experiments using pc12 cells
have revealed that imidacloprid generates single-channel
currents of multiple conductance states (nagata & narahashi 1995). although both ach and imidacloprid induced
single-channel currents of main conductance (-30 ps) and
subconductance (- 10 ps) states, ach generated predominantly the main conductance currents and imidacloprid
generated predominantly the subconductance currents.
ach-induced whole-cell currents were partially blocked by
co-application of imidacloprid. it is likely that imidacloprid
causes a shift from the main conductance state to the subconductance state resulting in a partial block of whole-cell
currents.
