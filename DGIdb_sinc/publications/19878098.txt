ischemia–reperfusion injury via j or d opioid
receptor activation

background: ischemic pre- or post-conditioning of the heart
has been shown to involve opioid receptors.  xxxd3094xxx , an
ultra-short-acting selective m opioid receptor agonist in clinical
use, pre-conditions the rat heart against ischemia–reperfusion
injury. this study investigates whether  xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning is also cardioprotective.
methods:  xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning (5-min infusion
at 1, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/min) or ischemic post-conditioning
(three cycles of a 10 s reperfusion interspersed with a 10 s
ischemia) was induced in an open-chest rat heart model of
ischemia and reperfusion injury, in the presence or absence
of nor-binaltorphimine, naltrindole or ctop, specific k, d
and m opioid receptor antagonists, respectively. the same
sequence of experiments was repeated in the isolated heart
model using the maximal protective dose of  xxxd3094xxx 
from the dose–response studies.
results: both ischemic and  xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning
reduced the myocardial infarct size relative to the control

group in both models. this cardioprotective effect for both
post-conditioning regimes was prevented by the prior
administration of nor-binaltorphimine and naltrindole
but not ctop. the sole administration of the antagonists
had no effect on the size of myocardial infarction.
conclusions: these results indicate that  xxxd3094xxx 
post-conditioning protects the heart from ischemia–reperfusion injury to a similar extent as of ischemic postconditioning. this protection involves k and d but not m
opioid receptor activation. this drug has great potential as
a clinical post-conditioning modality as it can be given
in large doses without prolonged opioid-related side
effects.

activation, possibly in a location outside the heart.8,9
as common reperfusion injury salvage pathways
may be triggered by pre- and post-conditioning,10
 xxxd3094xxx  could potentially post-condition the
myocardium. this study, evaluates whether  xxxd3094xxx  is cardioprotective when administered in a
post-conditioning fashion and compares its effect
with that of ischemic post-conditioning. the relative
role of opioid receptor subtypes in both regimes was
also investigated by the use of subtype-specific
opioid receptor antagonists.

post-conditioning refers to therapeutic
maneuvers administered just before final reperfusion that attenuate ischemia–reperfusion injury. ischemic post-conditioning involving staccato
reperfusion reduces infarct size (is) to an extent
comparable to that achieved by pre-conditioning,1
and molecular studies have implicated several
common components and pathways.2 opioid receptors are involved in ischemic post-conditioning,
as the latter can be blocked by the peripherally
restricted opioid antagonist naloxone methiodide3
and the d-specific antagonist naltrindole (ntd).4
not until recently has the role of m receptors in
post-conditioning been specifically addressed5 as it
has traditionally been thought to be absent from
the heart,6 although more recent binding studies
have challenged this.7

material and methods
all procedures were approved by the local committee for the use of live animals in teaching
and research. experiments were conducted using
8-week-old male sprague–dawley rats weighing

 xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning

300  25 g, which were housed in separate cages,
given free access to food and water, except before
the study, and were exposed to alternate 12-h light
and dark cycles. a total of 114 animals were used for
in the vivo and 74 for the isolated heart experiments.

in vivo induction of ischemia–reperfusion injury
an anesthetized open-chest model of ischemia and
reperfusion injury was used. the anesthetic and
surgical preparation to the point of post-conditioning and the is determination have been described in
detail previously.11 in short, anesthesia was induced
using pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg) and maintained
with boluses of 25 mg/kg 90 min after induction.
the heart was exposed via left thoracotomy at the
fifth intercostal space. repeated cycles of regional
ischemia and reperfusion were made by tightening
or releasing the snare placed at the origin of the left
coronary artery. more prolonged ischemia involved
securing the sutures with a mosquito hemostat.
ischemia was confirmed by cardiac cyanosis, a
substantial decrease in the mean arterial pressure
and electrocardiographic changes.

langendorff apparatus. each heart was immediately perfused with normal saline for 1 min at a
pressure of 100 cmh2o to remove residual blood.
the left coronary artery was re-occluded and 0.25%
evans blue dye was injected to stain the normally
perfused region of the heart. evans blue negative
area represented the area at risk (aar) from
occlusion of the left coronary artery. the hearts
were then frozen, cut into 2 mm slices, incubated at
37 1c for 20 min in 1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
(sigma chemical company, st louis, mo) in phosphate buffer at ph 7.4 and then immersed in 10%
formalin for 20 min to enhance the contrast of the
stain. the areas of infarct (triphenyltetrazolium
negative) and the risk zone for each slice were
traced and digitized using a computerized-planimetry technique (sigmascan 4.0, systat software
inc., richmond, ca). the volumes of the left
ventricles, is and aar were calculated by multiplying area with slice thickness and summing the
product. the is was expressed as a percentage of
the aar (is/aar), and this ratio was used to
compare the differences between the groups.

treatment protocols (fig. 1)
isolated rat heart preparation
after the removal from the anesthetized rat, the
heart was immediately perfused by the langendorff method, and subsequently converted to the
working heart model (preload 15 cmh2o, afterload
80 cmh2o). modified krebs–henseleit bicarbonate
buffer was used as the perfusion buffer (k–h
buffer, mm: nacl 118, kcl 4.7, cacl2 2.0,  xxxd2534xxx 
1.2, kh2po4 1.2, edta 0.5, nahco3 25, glucose 11,
ph 7.4, 37 1c, 95% o215% co2 gas mixture).
electrocardiograms and indices of left ventricular
performance pressure [left ventricular developed
pressure (lvdp), left ventricular end diastolic
pressure (lvedp), positive and negative maximum
left ventricular pressure derivative (1dp/dt and
dp/dt)] were measured using a power-lab monitoring system with a mikro-tip pressure catheter
(ad instruments, colorado springs, co). after an
initial stabilization period of 15 min, ligation of the
left coronary artery was performed using a 6-0
prolene loop, along with a snare occluder, to mimic
a regional ischemia condition for 30 min, followed
by 120 min of reperfusion.

myocardial is determination
after the 120 min of reperfusion, the hearts from
the in vivo were excised and transferred to a

all animals were subjected to
30 min of ischemia, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. rats were omitted from further data analysis
if severe hypotension (arterial mean blood pressure
o30 mmhg) or intractable ventricular fibrillation
occurred. at 5 min before the onset of reperfusion,
the animals were allocated to different treatments
according to a predetermined randomized sequence. all the drugs used were dissolved in
normal saline for administration.
intact animal studies.

dose–response studies. for a negative control group,
normal saline was infused for a period of 5 min
beginning just before reperfusion.  xxxd3094xxx 
post-conditioning was evaluated using a 5-min infusion of the drug at 1, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/min of
body weight (glaxosmithkline limited, hong
kong). in order to achieve near-steady-state levels
at reperfusion, the infusion was commenced 5 min
before the release of the snare occluder. for a positive
control, ischemic post-conditioning was used and
comprised of three cycles of 10 s of reperfusion and
10 s of ischemia before the final reperfusion.
this regime was chosen based on previous studies
in a rat model that was shown to be effective.12,13 the
 xxxd3094xxx  dose at which maximal protection occurred was selected for the antagonists and isolated
heart studies.

antagonist studies. each of the antagonists was
given 15 min before reperfusion to evaluate any
intrinsic effects they may have had on myocardial
is. these compounds were ntd, a d opioid
receptor selective antagonist,14  xxxd1793xxx –cys–tyr-dtrp–orn–thr–pen–thr–nh2 (ctop), a m opioid
receptor selective antagonist,15 and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-bni), a k opioid receptor selective
antagonist16 (sigma chemical company). these
selective opioid receptor antagonists were dissolved in normal saline and administered as a
bolus at the following doses: ntd (5 mg/kg); nor
bni (5 mg/kg) and ctop (1 mg/kg). both ischemic
post-conditioning and  xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning (20 mg/kg/min) were then performed in the
presence of individual antagonists administered
15 min before reperfusion.

isolated heart studies. the same sequences of experiments were performed in the isolated heart subjected to simulated ischemia and reperfusion. only
the dose of  xxxd3094xxx  that produced the maximal
reduction of is in the intact animal was used in the
isolated heart study. although it is unlikely that
 xxxd3094xxx  will reach the ischemic myocardium,
it was introduced 5 min before reperfusion to
mimic the in vivo preparation and continued for
5 min after the release of the snare occlude.

statistical analysis
the primary outcome is myocardial is, expressed
as percentage of the area at risk (is/aar). previous
data from our laboratory using this model of
cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury indicated the
expected is/aar of the control group to be between 50% and 60% and the expected magnitude of
is/aar reduction to be 40–50%. therefore, at least
five animals per group are required to yield a
power of 80% and a p-value of 0.05. all data are
expressed as mean  sd, and were obtained from
six to seven separate animals per group. statistical
significance was determined by one-way analysis
of variance (anova), with application of bonferroni correction if significant f ratios were obtained.
hemodynamic data were analyzed using one-way
anova for between-group comparisons and repeated measure anova for comparisons between
time points (spss version 16.0 for windows).

results
a total of 114 animals completed the in vivo experiments. nineteen rats were excluded from further
analysis as they developed refractory hypotension
(n 5 4) and ventricular fibrillation (n 5 15) during the
induction of regional ischemia. they have yet received any experimental drugs. a total of 74 rats
were used for the isolated heart preparations.

in vivo hemodynamic data
the hemodynamic data for the dose–response
studies are presented in table 1, and those for the
antagonist experiments are presented in table 2.
hemodynamic values including heart rate (hr),
mean arterial blood pressure (map) and rate–
pressure product (rpp) did not differ between
groups (p40.05) at baseline at the end of the
ischemic or reperfusion periods for both series of
experiments. for the dose–response experiments,
 xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning reduced the hr and
rpp, except for the 10 mg/kg dose. both the 5 and
the 20 mg/kg/min dose reduced the map. in the
antagonist experiments, the hr and rpp in all the
groups were also significantly lower during postconditioning compared with the control group,
with the map reduced only in the remifentanilcontaining groups.

in vivo is comparisons

the aar ranged from 0.36  0.02 to 0.44  0.03 cm3
and there were no significant differences between
the treatment groups. the is/aar was reduced by
 xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning at doses of 10 mg/
kg/min (40  4%) and 20 mg/kg/min (39  6%), as
well as ischemic post-conditioning (40  6%) when

compared with the control group (55  7%)
(po0.05) (fig. 2). although there was a reduction
in is/aar using 5 mg/kg/min (45.  6%), it did
not reach statistical significance when compared
with the control (p 5 0.07). however, there was no
difference in the infarct-sparing effect between the
two modes of post-conditioning (p 5 1.0). the addition of ntd or nor-bni before both ischemic and
 xxxd3094xxx  pre-conditioning prevented their protective effects. however, ctop had no significant
effect on either post-conditioning regime. the sole
administration of individual opioid receptor antagonists did not change the is compared with the
control (fig. 3).

hemodynamic indices in the isolated heart
the hr and indices of left ventricular performance
are presented in table 3. there were no differences
between groups at baseline, during ischemia, at 60
and 120 min after reperfusion for all indices. there
were also no differences between groups for the
positive and negative dp/dt values for all time
points.  xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning reduced
the lvdp, lvedp and hr  xxxd1891xxx  min after reperfusion. repoc1nor-bni reduced lvdp and hr at
10 min after reperfusion, whereas repoc1ntd and

discussion
the results of this study have demonstrated that
the application of an exogenous opioid in the form
of  xxxd3094xxx  after the start of the ischemic event
diminishes cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury to
an extent similar to that from ischemic post-conditioning, using both the intact rat and the isolated
heart perfusion model. there is an indication that
the degree of protection is related to the dose

administered in the in vivo model. activation of
either d or k opioid receptors is necessary for both
forms of post-conditioning in this model. the m
receptor appears not to be involved in this process.
the efficacy of post-conditioning in the isolated
heart model suggests that this process is at least in
part locally mediated.
because post-conditioning was first described
with the application of intermittent ischemia, a
number of ligand mediators/triggers have now
been identified, including adenosine,12,17 bradyki-

nin18 and opioids,19 as well as reactive oxygen
species.18 although chemically diverse, a common
theme underlying these compounds is that they are
all increased during ischemia and reperfusion.20–23
indeed, some have postulated that ischemic postconditioning is another form of staged or controlled reperfusion,24 possibly by altering the levels
of these compounds and maintenance of an acidic
ph.17 increased expression of endogenous opioids
in heart tissue around the time of myocardial
infarction has long been recognized25 and activation of opioid receptor subtypes may enhance
ischemic tolerance.26 activation of d opioid receptors by morphine has been demonstrated to inhibit
the mitochondria permeability transition pore,4 the
putative mechanism for ischemic tolerance and,
therefore, opioid post-conditioning. the significance of this study lies is not so much the demonstration of post-conditioning by an exogenous
opioid per se, but in the fact that the agent is a
selective m opioid receptor agonist in clinical use
and its potential clinical significance. the unique
pharmacokinetic properties of  xxxd3094xxx  among
the opioids would enable rapid attainment of high
plasma concentrations without the concern of prolonged opioid-related side effects. post-conditioning has a small window of effectiveness and rapid
achievement of sufficient plasma concentration
may not be attainable by other opioids with longer
half-lives without resorting to using high doses.
this may result in prolonged sedation and/or
respiratory depression. another point of significance on an experimental level is that  xxxd3094xxx 
is a selective m receptor agonist. with the exception
of one study,5 this receptor subtype has not been
implicated to be involved in post-conditioning.
in contrast to our current results with postconditioning,  xxxd3094xxx  mediates its preconditioning cardioprotective effect in part via m
receptors in the intact rat,8 but not in isolated rat
heart preparations.9 intrathecal morphine at a fraction of the intravenous dose can also pre-condition
the heart,27 an effect attenuated by intrathecal administration of the m-specific antagonist ctop.28
these observations support a role for the activation
of extra-cardiac m receptors in  xxxd3094xxx  pre-conditioning. such remote pre-conditioning has been
demonstrated with other triggers such as ischemia,
where pre-conditioning of one organ may confer
benefits in a remote organ.29 however, whether
post-conditioning, and in particular opioid postconditioning, can be remotely triggered remains to
be defined. recent work has suggested that post-

conditioning may be remotely triggered by inducing ischemia in a distant organ.30 it is not possible
to infer from our results whether  xxxd3094xxx  postconditioning is an entirely locally and/or remotely
triggered as the results are similar both in the intact
animal and in the isolated rat.
most previous observations regarding the relative roles of opioid receptors in post-conditioning
have implicated the d and k receptors,4,5,31 as our
current data also suggest. our observations, however, are inconsistent with those from zatta et al.,5
where the investigators demonstrated that the
effects of ischemic post-conditioning may be inhibited by the m opioid receptor antagonist ctap
at a dose between 0.09 and 0.19 umol/kg. the dose
of 1 mg/kg (0.94 mmol/kg) of ctop used in this
study is higher on a molar basis than the dose of
ctap used by zatta and colleagues and thus the
difference cannot be account for by an insufficient
dose. further inconsistencies are also seen with the
d receptor in post-conditioning. a study evaluating
morphine post-conditioning in the isolated heart
model demonstrated that its protective effect was
not attenuated by the d receptor antagonist ntd.32
this finding contrasts with previous work where a
specific d agonist was effective in producing postconditioning benefits.19 therefore, the relative roles
of opioid receptors in post-conditioning will require further definition, as it will influence the
choice of the exogenous opioid used.

cardiac post-conditioning has led to exciting
prospects for clinical cardiac protection as it removes the achilles’ heel of pre-conditioning, that
of timing the intervention before the index ischemic event. pharmacological post-conditioning
can potentially further circumvent the limitations
posed by ischemic post-conditioning in the clinical
setting. the iatrogenic induction of myocardial
ischemia could harm the diseased coronaries or
may be arrhythmogenic. pharmacological postconditioning may be more versatile as it can easily
be applied in the post-cardiopulmonary bypass
setting, in patients undergoing thrombolysis as
well as coronary angioplasty. should opioid postconditioning be shown to be clinically beneficial,
 xxxd3094xxx  would indeed be a logical choice for
this purpose.
in conclusion, data from this study have confirmed the efficacy of  xxxd3094xxx  post-conditioning
as being equal to that of ischemic post-conditioning
and both involve the activation of k and d receptors. it would be interesting to determine the
subcellular mechanisms involved in  xxxd3094xxx 
post-conditioning to see whether they are common
to those elicited by other opioids, ligands or ischemia. should obvious differences be apparent, consideration may be made to a multimodal approach
to post-conditioning, much analogous to the wellproven practice of multimodal analgesia.
