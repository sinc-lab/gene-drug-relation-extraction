abstract cultures of dissociated cerebellum from 7-dayold mice were used to investigate the mechanism involved
in synthesis and cellular redistribution of gaba in these
cultures consisting primarily of glutamatergic granule
neurons and a smaller population of gabaergic golgi and
stellate neurons. the distribution of gad, gaba and the
vesicular glutamate transporter vglut-1 was assessed using
specific antibodies combined with immunofluorescence
microscopy. additionally, tiagabine, skf 89976-a, betaine, b-alanine, nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  were used to
inhibit the  xxxg2143xxx , betaine/gaba ( xxxg2145xxx ),  xxxg2146xxx  and
 xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  transporters. only a small population of cells were
immuno-stained for gad while many cells exhibited
vglut-1 like immuno-reactivity which, however, never colocalized with gad positive neurons. this likely reflects
the small number of gabaergic neurons compared to the
glutamatergic granule neurons constituting the majority of
the cells. gaba uptake exhibited the kinetics of high
affinity transport and could be partly (20%) inhibited by
betaine (ic50 142 lm), b-alanine (30%) and almost fully
(90%) inhibited by skf 89976-a (ic50 0.8 lm) or

nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  at 1 mm concentrations
(95%). essentially all neurons showed gaba like immunostaining albeit with differences in intensity. the results
indicate that gaba which is synthesized in a small population of gad-positive neurons is redistributed to essentially all neurons including the glutamatergic granule cells.
 xxxg2143xxx  is not likely involved in this redistribution since
addition of 15 lm tiagabine ( xxxg2143xxx  inhibitor) to the culture medium had no effect on the overall gaba content of
the cells. likewise the  xxxg2145xxx  transporter cannot alone
account for the redistribution since inclusion of 3 mm
betaine in the culture medium had no effect on the overall
gaba content. the inhibitory action of b-alanine and high
concentrations of nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  on gaba
transport strongly suggests that also  xxxg2146xxx  or  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx 
(hugo nomenclature) could play a role.

it has been reported that cultures of dissociated cerebellum
from mice at an early post-natal age are capable of synthesizing and storing rather high amounts of gaba [1].
using pharmacological tools it could be demonstrated that
gaba is synthesized by the action of  xxxg913xxx  (gad) present in the small number of gabaergic neurons in these cultures [2]. it has been suggested
that this newly synthesized gaba may be redistributed to
the glutamatergic granule cells constituting the majority of
the neurons in these cultures [1] but a specific mechanism
accounting for this remains to be elucidated. while it
is well established that gaba can be released by a

depolarising stimulus in cerebellar cultures [3, 4] no
information is available about a mechanism allowing
uptake of gaba into the non-gabaergic granule neurons
in these cultures. since the presence of a gaba transporter
in these neurons would constitute the most likely mechanism for such uptake, the present study was aimed at
investigating this possibility. the betaine-gaba transporter-1 ( xxxg2145xxx ) may be a likely candidate as it is
expressed in a variety of both neurons and astrocytes
throughout the brain [5, 6]. likewise, the other non- xxxg2143xxx 
gaba transporters  xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  (hugo nomenclature) could play a role in the transfer process as they, and in
particular  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx , are expressed in the brain [5, 6]. this was
studied using betaine, b-alanine, nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  to inhibit uptake of radio-labelled gaba in the
cultures. additionally, a possible role of the gaba
transporter-1 ( xxxg2143xxx ) being expressed mainly by gabaergic neurons [5, 6] was investigated using the tiagabine
analog skf 89976-a which at low concentrations specifically inhibits  xxxg2143xxx  and at high concentrations may inhibit
both  xxxg2143xxx  and  xxxg2145xxx  [7]. the classical inhibitors of
neuronal and astrocytic gaba transport nipecotic acid,
 xxxd2248xxx  and b-alanine [8] were used to further characterize gaba uptake in the cultures as these gaba analogs
inhibit the gaba transporters  xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  (hugo
nomenclature) in addition to  xxxg2143xxx  [9, 10]. in order to
identify the neuronal populations in these cultures, specific
antibodies for gad and the vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut-1) were utilized to visualize gabaergic
and glutamatergic neurons, respectively [11, 12].

primary cultures of dissociated cerebellum
cerebellar cells were dissociated from cerebellum of
7-day-old nmri mice [13]. the brain tissue was trypsinized followed by trituration in a dnase solution containing
a  xxxd207xxx  from soybeans. cells were suspended
(1.6 9 106 cells/ml) in a slightly modified dulbecco’s
minimum essential medium (dmem) containing 25 mm
glucose, 25 mm kcl, supplemented with p-aminobenzoate, insulin, penicillin and 10% fetal calf serum and seeded
in poly-d-lysine coated plastic.  xxxd1790xxx 
(20 lm) or a mixture of 20 lm uridine and 5 lm 5-fluoro20 -deoxyuridine was added after 24–48 h to prevent
astrocyte proliferation.
effect of tiagabine and betaine on gaba content
cerebellar neurons were cultured for 3 or 5 days in the
absence or presence of 15 lm tiagabine or 3 mm betaine.
at the end of the culture period, the culture medium was
removed and the cells washed with ice-cold phosphate
buffered isotonic salt solution and extracted in 70% (v/v)
ethanol [2]. gaba was determined by hplc analysis
[2, 14] and protein as described below (gaba uptake).

inhibitors, each in triplicate, were used for each concentration–response curve. cells were then washed three times
with cold buffer, collected in 0.2 m naoh and aliquots
were taken for determination of radioactivity and protein
content. specific uptake was calculated by subtracting the
uptake in wells containing 5 mm gaba. radioactivity
was determined by liquid scintillation counting, using the
optiphase liquid scintillation. proteins were determined by

immunocytochemistry
cells were grown in permanox chamber slides. cultures
were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs (30 min at room temperature, 22–24°c) and permeabilized with a solution of
0.1% saponin and 3% goat serum (for gad and vglut-1)
or 0.05% triton-x100 (for gaba) in pbs. after this, the
cultures were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies (anti-gad, 1:750; anti-vglut-1, 1:2,500; antigaba, 1:1,000) in a solution containing 1% goat serum in
pbs, rinsed with pbs and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with the secondary antibody, alexa 488
(1:1,500) or alexa 546 (1:1,000). after rinsing with pbs,
the slides were coverslipped with mowiol (calbiochem
ltd., nottingham, uk). the cells were examined using a
fluorescence microscope equipped with phase contrast
(nikon  xxxd1685xxx ; nikon, tokyo, japan) using 409 objectives
and digitally photographed with a colorview camera (soft
imaging systems, stuttgart, germany). cells were also
examined in a confocal fluorescence microscope (leica
tcs nt, leica microsystems). control of the secondary
antibodies, performed by omitting the primary antibodies,
showed no fluorescence.
data analysis
results are presented as means ± sem. saturation and
inhibition curves were fit to one-site hyperbolic and
sigmoidal concentration–response functions, respectively,
using graphpad prism version 4.00 for windows, graphpad software, san diego california usa. statistical
analysis was based on a one- and two-tailed student’s t test
or one-way anova with repeated measures (inset

results
gaba uptake in primary cultures of cerebellar
neurons and effect of inhibitors
km and vmax values for gaba uptake in primary cultures
of cerebellar neurons were 17.4 ± 7.0 lm and 3.9 ±
1.4 nmol 9 mg protein-1 9 min-1, respectively, n = 3
(fig. 1a). the maximal transport rate (vmax) was significantly lower than that in primary cultures of neocortical
neurons, consisting primarily of gabaergic neurons,
whereas the apparent km for gaba transport was similar
(results not shown).

was constructed on the basis of experiments performed in the
presence of 1 nm [3h]gaba and gaba concentrations in the
range 1–300 lm. results are means ± sem of three experiments.
b inhibition curves were constructed on the basis of experiments
performed in the presence of 5 lm [3h]gaba and different
concentrations of skf 89976-a (filled square) or betaine (filled
triangle). the inset shows the effect of 10 lm skf 89976-a alone or
in combination with 4 mm betaine. the ‘a’ indicates a statistically
significant difference (p \ 0.001) versus the control and a ‘b’ a
difference (p \ 0.05) between the skf 89976-a alone versus the
combination with betaine. results are means ± sem of 3–5
experiments

betaine inhibited [3h]gaba uptake in primary cultures
of cerebellar granule cells with an ic50 value of
142 ± 52 lm (n = 4) and a maximum inhibition of about
20% of the control uptake (fig. 1b). the specific  xxxg2143xxx 
inhibitor skf 89976 inhibited [3h]gaba uptake with an
ic50 value of 0.8 ± 0.1 lm and a maximum inhibition of
about 90% of the control uptake (fig. 1b). furthermore, the
non- xxxg2145xxx  gaba transporter inhibitors nipecotic acid
and  xxxd2248xxx  acting on  xxxg2143xxx  as well as  xxxg2146xxx / xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx 
almost completely inhibited [3h]gaba uptake at 1 mm
(remaining uptake: 3.1 ± 1.1 and 6.1 ± 1.8% of control
gaba uptake, respectively). additionally, b-alanine at a
concentration of 1 mm inhibited [3h]gaba uptake by
30 ± 8%.
inhibition of [3h]gaba uptake by betaine was additionally performed in the presence of 10 lm skf 89976 to
substantially block the  xxxg2143xxx  transporter (fig. 1b, inset).
skf 89976-a inhibited the gaba uptake by 65% and in
the additional presence of 4 mm betaine the uptake was
further inhibited to a total of 71% (fig. 1b, inset).

immunostaining for gad and vglut-1
immunofluorescence labelling of expression of gad and
vglut-1 as markers of gabaergic and glutamatergic
neurons, respectively, in the cerebellar neuronal cultures is
shown in fig. 2a–d. it is seen that gad immunofluorescence is very intense in a small population of the neurons
(fig. 2a, b) whereas in case of vglut-1, immunofluorescence was very intense in a large fraction of the cells,
particularly in cell processes (fig. 2a, c). background
fluorescence in samples where the primary antibody for
either gad or vglut-1 was omitted was barely detectable
(not shown). the difference in the expression pattern of
gad and vglut-1 is underlined by the lack of coinciding
staining shown in fig. 2d, and as a confocal photomicrograph in fig. 3.

immunostaining for gaba

of gaba among individual cells in the cerebellar neuronal cultures, immunostaining for gaba was performed using an antibody recognizing gaba in fixed

effect of tiagabine on gaba content
in order to see whether chronic exposure of the cerebellar
neurons to tiagabine, the  xxxg2143xxx  selective gaba transporter inhibitor might affect the gaba content of cells,
cultures were exposed for different culture periods to
tiagabine at a concentration (15 lm) affecting only  xxxg2143xxx .
table 1 shows that tiagabine at this concentration had no
effect on the average gaba content of the cultures
regardless of the culture/exposure period. additionally, it
was examined if inclusion of 3 mm betaine inhibiting the
 xxxg2145xxx  transporter might affect the gaba content. table 1
shows that this was not the case.

discussion
the results of the present study including a biochemical
determination of average gaba contents in the cerebellar
cultures as well as immunocytochemistry showing the
presence of gaba in individual cells confirm the previous
demonstration of relatively high gaba levels in these
cultures consisting primarily of glutamatergic granule
neurons and a smaller population of gabaergic golgi and
stellate neurons [1, 2, 13, 15]. moreover, the pattern of
immunostaining for gaba is in keeping with the notion
that gaba most likely is transferred from the few gad
expressing cells capable of gaba synthesis, i.e., differences exist among the neurons with regard to the actual
level of gaba contents. such existence of a rather small
population of neurons with a high gaba content is in
perfect agreement with the findings in the present study and

cerebellar neuronal cultures were prepared and maintained in vitro (3 or 5 days) as described in experimental procedures and some of the culture
media contained either 15 lm tiagabine or 3 mm betaine. at the end of the culture period, the medium was removed and the cultures rinsed and
extracted for analysis of gaba (for details, see experimental procedures). values are expressed as percent of the gaba content in the control
cultures since different batches of cultures exhibited differences in gaba contents (range 10–35 nmol/mg protein). results are means ± sem

number of neurons exhibiting gad immuno-like staining.
the remaining neurons showing a low intensity of immunostaining for gaba are very likely glutamatergic granule
neurons as a large population of the neurons in these cultures stained positively for vglut-1, a marker for glutamatergic neurons [12]. it is of importance in this context
that the vglut-1 immunofluorescence never was found to
coincide with the gad immunoreactive neurons. this
finding unequivocally shows that the cultures consist of at
least two populations of neurons.
the other question which was addressed in the present
study concerns the mechanism by which gaba may be
transferred from the site of synthesis in the gad
expressing neurons [2] to the glutamatergic granule
neurons.
the kinetic study of gaba uptake in the cultures of
cerebellar cells showed the characteristics of neuronal
gaba transport. first, the km value for gaba uptake was
similar to that described in an enriched gabaergic neuronal population like primary cultures of neocortical neurons (km: 14–17 lm [16]); and the affinity for gaba in
this preparation was higher than that in cultured astrocytes
(km: 30 lm [16]). [3h]gaba uptake was to a considerable
extent inhibited by the gaba transporter inhibitors skf
89976-a selective for  xxxg2143xxx  and nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  inhibiting additionally  xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  [9, 10].
our results also show that at a gaba concentration of
5 lm around 20% of the gaba transport in the cerebellar
cultures is mediated through the  xxxg2145xxx  transporter,
according to the maximum inhibition obtained with betaine. betaine is a selective inhibitor of the  xxxg2145xxx  transporter
[17] without any effect on the other gaba transporters
( xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx , hugo nomenclature). furthermore, the ic50 value for betaine as inhibitor of
[3h]gaba uptake in the cultured cerebellar cells is in
agreement with reported values for  xxxg2145xxx  expressed in
xenopus oocytes [9]. these studies suggest that the
majority of gaba transport capacity is accounted for by
 xxxg2143xxx  and  xxxg2145xxx . a small contribution from  xxxg2146xxx  or
 xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  should, however, also be considered since nipecotic
acid and  xxxd2248xxx  inhibiting  xxxg2143xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx , and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx , at a
high concentration (1 mm) had a substantial inhibitory
effect. moreover, 1 mm b-alanine affecting primarily
 xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  [10] inhibited gaba uptake by 30%.
collectively, these results indicate that  xxxg2146xxx  or  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx 
could be of importance for gaba redistribution, albeit the
selectivity of nipecotic acid and  xxxd2248xxx  at this high
concentration may be questioned. that the non- xxxg2143xxx 
transporters may indeed play a functional role is further
supported by the observation that tiagabine at a low concentration at which it selectively inhibits the gaba
transporter  xxxg2143xxx  [9] had no effect on the average gaba
content of the cultured cells. the finding that 3 mm betaine

1389

in the culture medium had no effect on the cellular gaba
content suggests that in addition to  xxxg2145xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx , and
 xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  are involved in the redistribution of gaba.
the number of  xxxg913xxx  (gad)-positive
neurons accounts for 6% and 40–50% of the neurons in
primary cultures of cerebellar cells and of neocortical
neurons, respectively [1, 18, 19]. this proportion is in
agreement with the lower vmax found in cultured cerebellar
cells compared to neocortical neurons. also, the presence
of  xxxg2143xxx  in non-gabaergic cells can not be ruled out
since hybridization signals for  xxxg2143xxx  mrna have been
reported in the rat cerebellar granule cell layer [20].
the findings that the granule cells expressing vglut-1
contained gaba which very likely primarily originated
from uptake mediated by  xxxg2145xxx ,  xxxg2146xxx  or  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx  may
appear at odds with previous immunocytochemical investigations of the presence of gaba in the different neuronal
cell types in cerebellum in vivo [21, 22]. these studies
reported immunostaining for gaba in all gabaergic
neurons but failed to detect significant staining for gaba
in the granule neurons. it is, however, important to keep in
mind that the detection limit for the immunocytochemical
method employed is likely to be around 1–2 mm gaba
[23]. this gaba level is close to the average gaba
concentration in the cerebellar cultures reported earlier [1]
as well as in the present study.
the functional significance of the presence of the nongat1 gaba transporters in a glutamatergic neuron
allowing these cells to assimilate gaba remains to be
established. it may be of interest that it has recently been
demonstrated that  xxxg2145xxx  and possibly  xxxg2146xxx  and  xxxg2144xxx   xxxg2146xxx 
may play a role in control of epileptogenic activity [24–28]
by regulating availability of gaba acting at extrasynaptic
gaba receptors [24, 27, 28]. as proposed previously [1,
29] such a mechanism may well be of importance for
balancing excitatory and inhibitory activity in cerebellum
as well.
