specific ligand for a central type  xxxg1879xxx  attenuates neuronal damage in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.  the neuroprotective effect of a central type  xxxg1879xxx  ligand was examined in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. under halothane anesthesia, male sprague-dawley rats were subjected to left middle cerebral artery occlusion. a selective central type  xxxg1879xxx  ligand, 15-deoxy-(16-m-tolyl)-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin methylester, or a peripheral type  xxxg1879xxx  ligand,  xxxd2331xxx  methylester, were administered intravenously immediately after ischemia. twenty-four hours after ischemia, brain damage was evaluated. in separate experiments, concentrations of 15-deoxy-(16-m-tolyl)-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin in ischemic brain tissue were measured by injection of a tritium labeled compound. treatment with 15-deoxy-(16-m-tolyl)-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin methylester (0.03 mg/kg) significantly (p<0.05) reduced the volume of brain damage by 35%. with this treatment, the concentration of this compound in the brain was more than 10 nm. treatment with  xxxd2331xxx  methylester did not show a neuroprotective effect. these results indicated that activation of a central type  xxxg1879xxx  attenuates ischemic brain damage. the present study demonstrated that the intravenous application of a central type  xxxg1879xxx  ligand could be a novel therapeutic agent for acute stroke.
